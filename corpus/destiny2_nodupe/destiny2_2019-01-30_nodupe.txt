Okay well thanks for the response. I appreciate it.
---
---
---
They would down the titan before seeing "marked for vengeance"
---
Or just run three lost sectors real quick
---
Np b :) 
---
Bruh all of your who say it's possible are big fat damn liars.
---
RISE MY ARMORED BROTHERS, THE DAY OF THE KNIFE AND PALM IS OVER! NO MORE SHALL WE TREMBLE BEFORE A SCRAWNY HUNTER. NO MORE SHALL WE WORRY ABOUT THAT WEAK WARLOCK IN THE DISTANCE. RISE MY BROTHERS, THE DAY OF THE FIST HAS COME!!!
---
Naw a Titan who uses this exotic it‚Äôs the only one that scared blade barrage users 
---
If you're hunter, spam Blade Barrage in mayhem. It's even easier if you have shards.
---

---
Titan, spam hammers. Top tree for the explosions. Stay in cover when your super isn't charged.
---
Warlock, spam bottom tree nova bombs, and use skull of a dire ahamkara if you have it.
---
Tadah.
---
Upvote this for being true!! 
---
Stop trying to use a sniper with enemies 10 feet away. You can't do it in any game or real life!! ITS A SNIPER FOR RANGE!
---
  PvP is utterly shite.
---
This is getting out of hand, now there are 2 of them!
---
and then TRIALS CAME AROUND LIKE "SUP BRAH"
---
many controllers were lost that day...
---
Except your super energy vanishes if you try to charge it up which you have to because they decreased the range on it
---
yess
---
Except for the fact that it's just gonna have people non-stop leaving crucible matches to find better teams. Would have been way better as a progression IMO. 
---
just need dedicated servers the peer to peer is poo.
---
Titans and warlocks dont because all their exotics are so trash there is nothing to exploit
---
Hey man, it's harder for some people than it is for others because of their skill in crucible and the other players they face. You probably aren't quite as good as the people you get matched against and that's why it's so difficult for you. 
---
orrr you could go play BO4, the guy is stating an opinion, next time give a less hostile answer
---
Ya it is fairly hard to get into. 
---
One thing is I‚Äôm pretty sure there is a way to get everything by just playing the game the micro transactions just let you skip grinding/ waiting
---
Turns out training a group of elite heavily armored warriors to hold a wall at all costs doesn't work out when the enemy flies over that wall. 
---
I'm trash in crucible lol I freely admit that.
---
Welcome to mayhem
---
Excellent pun but I'm still finding it painfully annoying even in Mayhem
---
Definitely, lots and lots of grinding
---
It's mayhem week. You can do it
---
Already did üòÅ, played destiny since D1 on day 1 and so many people have left because they only focus on PVP with the patches and updates while the bugs like rivens walk guitar error still causes issues with getting the flawless raid.  I‚Äôve stayed loyal this whole time hoping bungie would get better but all this recycled content, exotics, &amp; gear is like buying a 2014 Audi at the same price as a 2019... paying full price for something old
---
...isn't his horn on the other side?
---
This has been the most rage inducing thing I have done in any game I can think of. As a strictly pve player bungie you can go fuck yourself
---
yeah, tried that. that's where I lost all my progress.
---
No, it‚Äôs *not* a flamethrower
---
If it makes you feel better, I'm at 87% after 2 games... 
---
Go mayhem :v
---
You just need kda more than one to progress I guess. 
---
30 mins i believe
---
RUMBLE played 3 qp matches and got \~10%, played 3 rumble matches and got it.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Random drop. 
---
I've noticed with guns like that one and ace, it looks like they fire from the bottom of the cylinder instead of the top.
---
Cheers mate!
---
I think it got added to the loot pool. Believe you can get it as a random drop.
---
Ahh, thanks
---
I think I'll just try to get a kill or two per may h at most.
---
Amen, brother. 
---
Because that would make too much sense.
---
&gt; Most people aren‚Äôt good in crucible and they can‚Äôt get kills without dying a lot in the game mode. 
---
In that case.. why are they working on a clearly for PvP designed weapon in the first place?
---
Sorry to hear that, I'm quite excited to get to step 5.
---
Yeah no it's fine in PvE but I feel like anything that shoots bullets can be fine in PvE, idk maybe I just need to get better at hipfire aiming is all
---
Shoot shit don‚Äôt die. Basically 
---
I did my 3 doing ep
---
Nades take care of that shit
---
It‚Äôs not only for pvp it can be used in pve situations 
---
Are invasion kills in gambit confirmed to progress the quest or nah?
---
Forsure I see what you were saying, yeah there's likely no reason to have a set other than just aesthetic
---
As someone without the AP, I'm kinda thankful because I can jerk off to this beautiful gu...I mean appreciate this fine fire arm
---
I did 2 games of mayhem and was like nope not happening here
---
Random drop. Got it last night from killing ads in Gambit
---
Yeah it was a joke. Every class has their time on top. It's a wheel, always changing. Hunters are on top right now, which suggest titans will have their time next. Warlocks habe had their fun for a while XD
---
Not that it's an exact science, but that was the trend in D1. 
---
Which one? 
---
1st crucible step - play conservative and take the easy kills
---
2nd step - follow team mates and kill people that killed them
---
Reality - play usual PvP and don‚Äôt be put off by the quest step.
---
&gt; Hunters easily have the best kit and dopest exotics for PvP
---
We have shards, gwisin, uhhh.... Foetracer? No, that's just a poor man's OEM. Can you explain Dragon's Shadow? It looks like trash on paper - dodge reloads all weapons which is pretty pointless because you'll have your primary, your 3 rounds of special and any heavy you pickup reloads itself, but increased run speed and ADS for 5 seconds is worthless. The Frostees build sounds interesting, it's too bad dodge doesn't actually dodge anything, and I can reload faster than I can dodge.  
---
&gt;Up until Forsaken Titans have had the worst supers, the worst exotics
---
Skullfort, Mask of the Quiet One, Doom Fang, Lion Rampant, and then you got your 2 new exotics. 
---
&gt;they don't have a roaming super that even comes close to Nova Warp or Spectral Blades
---
I'm not sure why you think 100mph OHK homing hammers isn't as good as those two, I think it's pretty easy to kill anyone running around in Spectral Blades because you can just see them on your radar and the invis blows. But don't worry, both of those got nerfed pretty hard.
---
I think the base look of the gun looks much better without the ornament 
---
I was going to say if you were on Xbox I would join your fireteam.
---
Cool thanks I keep tossing up which one to grind for 
---
That would be nice
---
Honestly same but I'm in denial 
---
Akimbo when
---
I've got it already and it's a bit underwhelming, to be honest. Ace is still better, Luna and Not Forgotten are still dominating handcannon fights. It's in a better state than it was at the end of D1 but it's going to be a gun for a very few people. I enjoyed the quest though, last step has a very cool mechanic and can't wait for Thorn.
---
Just play for fun and don't count your progress. Don't worry about winning, be selfish and look out for your own kd. Over time you will get there. Also, as soon as you start messing up lots, quit and come back to it. It helps to only play when you're in the zone.
---
Good luck!
---
No, the catalyst is a random drop, after which you need 300 precision kills (not retroactive iirc)
---
he hit his head hard on that wall, I could see it bounce back
---
I understand that 100% lol can‚Äôt really go wrong either way. GG‚Äôs on getting it tho
---
My friend is having the same problem. The quest worked for me, but he is having the same issues as you guys.
---
‚ÄúOne has magic, and the other has poor physics code‚Äù
---
I didnt know cod has magic
---
*Sweats in jotunn*
---
ya but for a map like this, it's fine. Or if you are a hunter you could run knucklehead radar.
---
I didn't conform it but it says crucible. :/ My instinct says no. it would just say guardians.
---
Nova Warp? What's that? Voidwalker only has two subclasses 
---
*Throws void balls infinitely with Skull of Dire Ahamkara*
---
I have, and none of those have a faster TTK.
---
Ight boss 
---
Ah ok fare enough 
---
Just do Mayhem right now. Even if you die within 10 seconds, you should be able to get a super off.
---
Yep as stated with box breathing it becomes a 3 shot, making it have the same TTK as Luna's howl and NF.
---
Strafe jump fang disagrees strongly
---
And in which PvE situation would a handcannon with zero additional damage be useful compared to the alternatives?
---
It's designed for PvP and while you can clearly use it in PvE (i will myself, just because i enjoy it) it doesn't mean it will be effective, balanced around it, or aimed at people doing so.
---
Oh boy, 25 payback medals is going to be fun for you.
---
5 times...3 at the first encounter learning it, twice at the end 
---
Don't think you know what you're talking about sir. This scout rifle with box breathing has the same TTK as luna's howl and NF which btw makes it have one of the 3 highest TTKs in the game (Excluding now The last word).
---
A new gun is gonna get people back, not doing the same three missions where the quest giver just keeps bitching and whining.
---
This happened to me several times, you clearly see the last shadow shoot of to the right after i hit him yet i die. Doesnt seem right to me
---
Yep same exact problem. 
---
The missions is glitchy, go to orbit and go back in.
---
what does beeing a titan mean on that context, even more titan beeing the most op class on pc in pvp
---
Play with your team, don't just go looking for kills solo. It's not hard if you understand how to survive long in crucible.
---
I just got the last word! I‚Äôm pumped. Took me a few hours but oh well it was a fun time. Gonna play some gambit with it now lol
---
thorn quest i presume
---
I did and I enjoyed it. 
---
Lol no i mean since destiny 1 there is no skill anymore
---
I changed your source link from eu.battle to us.battle and that's what came up so I don't know what to tell you. However a google search agrees that its against ToS according to forum posts by users (but never moderators.) The more interesting thing is the lack of confirmation that anyone has ever been punished and the sheer number of people bragging about getting away with it. I concede that you're likely right, it is a bannable offense, but one that doesn't seem enforced at all.
---
I use high jump in pvp. Triple jump in pve. 
---
oh thank you lol
---
Is it worth $10.00 to ya?
---
According to my teammates the goal is either to AFK or run straight at 4 guys on the enemy team with a sniper rifle out
---
And then immediately go bitch on the forums about how unbalanced the crucible is. 
---
Same with me man, hopefully I‚Äôll get it in my other characters lol
---
Time to spend money $$$
---
Yeah that‚Äôs exactly why mayhem didn‚Äôt work for me, people like you :)
---
Happened to me once, just gotta be quicker.
---
I got Lemonade twice in a week. Literally the only exotics I've seen in over a month that weren't purchased from Xur or earned through a quest.
---
Uh...yay?
---
Just play more safe don‚Äôt rush out. Pulse rife is your friends. This is way better the. Other pvp quest steps we have had
---
N
---
No need to downvote me, if you had it, you would use it to. And you know it ;)
---
Yeah and why should i have to do frickin raids to get raid gear ???
---
That's a pretty stupid overgeneralization.  And nowhere near what you actually posted.
---
What a trollbag.
---
I didn‚Äôt..
---
And the golem and scorn blast they lock on to 1 target don't stop til they've blasted your body into 50 pieces.
---
What step is that?
---

I dont know who the fuck at bungie ever thought this was a great quest idea but they sure are a special kinda stupid. I logged off tonight in pure rage and hate for the game at 1 percent on the quest after 2 hours of crucible. Yeah I stuck at pvp but I dont give a fuck, I'll never become a sliding shotgun ape just to get better at crucible. Big fuck up imo from bungie making this unattainable for average players. 
---
F in the chat for this lad. Clearly he has been hurt
---
Yeah dont do mayhem, I get up to 10% then go right back down to 3, no matter how hard i try.
---
EA
---
I'd much rather wait and see how it does before I spend my money on it
---
I don‚Äôt use hand cannons, but I fucking love this thing.
---
Wow this dude seems pretty cool
---
I fixed it by restarting and every time the pointer shows up to guide you just wait for it to finalize an area. Its stupid its this easy to mess it up/glitch it but they will fix it. 
---
Mad cuz bad
---
Pvp is the worst part about this game. YES IT IS THAT BAD. There are far too many instant deaths. It's atrocious. I'd rather play nearly any CoD than this game's pvp.
---
" I was able to get it done in 5 games and I'm not the best in crucible."
---
Please, stop lying. I AM not good at crucible. Three matches and im at 22%. You are above average. Stop sugar coating it. This quest step is aids for anyone who doesn't love the circle jerk shitshow that is pvp.
---
The gameplay loop was fun and at the end if the day that's what matters. I'm honestly rooting for it to be a big success to give bungie some competition so they start improving. 
---
That‚Äôs what I thought... Thanks for the help!
---
When you log into BattleNet, and boot up Destiny 2, it gives you options for region. It‚Äôs a noticeable difference for me when I‚Äôm switching between the two. 
---
It is not. 
---
Okay, next time you see a title alone like that, just keep your mouth shut please
---
Go play Mayhem for the 2 steps you need crucible stuff. You can do it in no time.
---
too soon
---
Why do you need help?
---
Yes for pve I say pve is way better than pvp 
---
I always wonder why someone would go through the effort of showing off what hate mail they got.
---
Then I realize idiots give them attention like it's something neat.
---
Have the same roll and I added a surrounded mod but I got a reload masterwork. Love it! 
---
A 6 stack is better than a 2 stack of idiots
---
Not really that difficult. I'm not even that good at pvp and I found it quite easy to do. Took me like 10 crucible matches.
---
Can someone explain me the importance of crucible resets? Just got back after quitting on warmind
---
Maybe 
---
U never know
---
But AoS has nutty range
---
Fair but I appear to be having the shittest of luck. Daybreak/Spectral Blades/Shotgun abusers/Trace Rifles etc. Etc.
---
I did mine in rumble. At least they gave you mayhem this week to get it done. 
---
All of these being reminders of why I avoid crucible like the plague 
---
Ive been touched 
---
Get out of here with that logic
---
You also need it for the thorn which drops in the next dlc
---
I mean the tecnique, some advice tricks... You know, sorry im not that stupid... I think
---
The most annoying thing is probably only 8 bullets and the low range but i will try your advices thank u very much ^^
---
So...Does the LW quest tie into the Thorn quest as speculated?
---
A suppression item
---
(Titan grenade)
---
(Two tailed fox)
---
(Hunter tether)
---
Will stop the shielding, you might only have a few seconds to damage, but if you can make a servitor flinch they should not re-shield
---
If we do get one I hope it has to do with Shin malphur aka The Man With The Golden Gun
---
I mean im going to assassinate mara anyways sooooo....
---
Thank you
---
I bet you're a jolly of a person to be around 
---
"I want a gun that's literally useless in everything but pvp but I don't want to play pvp"
---
I haven‚Äôt tested it out yet in PvE but I do know they all got a 10% damage buff in pve
---
Have you tried restarting the mission? If that doesn‚Äôt work then idk
---
There are certain things that take away a lot of the fun for me though. The fact that you can‚Äôt check or use anything you find until you go back to the main areas and the crazy long loading screens when going from one area to another in the world are my main complaints. 
---
Like imagine fighting all the way to a boss just to find out your loadout isn‚Äôt going to work and then having to start all over. Like doing SOTP and then having to start over after getting to the boss and finding out you need a whisper or equivalent. 
---
If you want to compete with Bungie you need to look at everything they‚Äôve done right and wrong and improve on that. 
---
It‚Äôs definitely a neat game but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be much competition for a very long time. 
---
Oh, just looked it up. I do have the quest! I have been working on it, at the last step too. That will help me with the last step for Maleficence. 
---
Sanguine Alchemy
---
The quest for the final step for me was PL 500. I‚Äôm only 610 if that matters. There were also three phases with the boss; one acolyte, two, and then three. 
---
I got in I got out now I‚Äôm done with mayhem, enjoy kids. 
---
u aint shit 
---
Sounds to me like someone doesn't have a tv from 2012-presentüòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇ
---
Ahhhhhhhhhh totally missed that &gt;.&lt; 
---
Found the guy I was playing against
---
Crazy that you‚Äôre getting downvoted just because people are mad that you don‚Äôt suck as bad as they do. 
---
Theyre still good, stop complaining 
---
DUN DUN DUUUNN!!!
---
Remember all the times metas were just handed to us like candy on halloween (mida, graviton, etc.) and how happy everyone was about it?
---
Me neither.
---
To be perfectly honest, skill should be rewarded at least every now and then.
---
Haha no its not
---
You get 2 per kill and lose 2 per kill. If you aren't breaking even with unlimited super, I think that's on you.
---
You don‚Äôt see me bitching about a Destiny standard quest line on the internet , do you? 
---
I just call ‚Äòem as I see ‚Äòem. 
---
I‚Äôm a D1 day 1 beta player, I‚Äôve seen it all.   This is nothing new. 
---
When we started this conversation, I actually did go and test it and it worked, so? Again, try getting off the ground, apparently you've never used catapult lift. Calling you a douche when you start acting like one has nothing to do with who's right.
---
Nice job üëç
---
I got it done in only 3 quick play matches. I don't see how it's that frustrating...
---
An awesome montage man, I loved it üòç
---
Lol.  
---
Whatever shitbird. 
---
Nobody ever killed anyone shooting blanks
---
I haven‚Äôt played in a bit. How is this possible?
---
Try rumble, the more kills you get without dying, the faster you progress 
---
xol liked this
---
I cannot 
---
That‚Äôs cuz you suck, I‚Äôve played maybe an hour and a half of crucible and am at 70%. My recommendation is to do comp, solo. The matchmaking is good enough that you should get a positive efficiency every game.
---
Luna‚Äôs isn‚Äôt that hard, and you won‚Äôt be playing against stacked teams with it or NF until after at least getting to Fabled unless you‚Äôre in a really low player count region like Australia. 
---
Thorn was incredibly strong when it was released but went through multiple nerfs not long after. 
---
I‚Äôm sorry but there is literally nothing valid about this post. 
---
Yeah. I don't know what the hell happened but it is WAY more dominant this time around than it was the last time. 
---
damn right üòé
---
Luna‚Äôs Howl exists. I tried and I lost progress.
---
Initially, it‚Äôs whatever got poured on top that made the erupting volcano pit thing. What was beneath that though was just pretty much the snake fireworks you can get, but on steroids
---
Tried that. Kept dying left and right.
---
No need to be rude about it
---
They made is so 6 shot gg kills give a bullet back.
---
Thanks! üòÅ
---
You‚Äôre awesome! üòÅ
---
That‚Äôs amazing, thanks man.
---
it's not really useful as an exotic, it will probably be a niche in crucible but u have to get dat heavy first
---
BUT DAMN IS IT FUNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
---
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è sorry, I just can‚Äôt see how you complain about it already. Either you haven‚Äôt played much crucible (which means you shouldn‚Äôt be complaining) or you have and just suck at it.
---
Fire from the hip and hold down the trigger until your target is dead.
---
Again, don't be rude
---
You know that not everyone can go positive, right? 
---
I have it and broooooo its actually way easier to control by the hip which makes u feel so badass 
---
I got the ornament but can't get the gun since I don't have the annual pass rip
---
That's why you play passive with a pulse, you'll beat it for range easily 
---
Mayhem is meant to be incredibly dumb and allow for things to be overpowering. Nothing has ruined it, this is how the game mode works. 
---
And I‚Äôm so glad it‚Äôs an easy one.
---
When Banshee tells you that the Ace of Spades is broken.
---
What is that even supposed to mean lmao
---
Just infuse AoS into Last Word LUL
---
Is that the 50 charges one or the 6 forge completions?
---
Oof. I‚Äôll see you in the Crucible.
---
Is that an Age of Ultron reference
---
Yeah I might just wait til tomorrow. Nothings working 
---
time passed, more hunter mains got shards
---
Holy shit. Lmao.
---
Shoulda been free to everyone who atleast bought foresaken but companies are money hungry and dont deserve the money they get for how little content they add lol
---
Oh yeah i forgot about all those weapons that do literally nothing in strikes
---
nice what is that armor set?
---
If you die you lose points. 
---
Perhaps something to do with bugfixes? Like the scout rifle fix they are supposed to implement?
---
Actually a decent ornament
---
Had a Veist scout tested on me, holy hell the flinch was crazy for some reason. Felt like an Ace was shooting me at 260 RPM. Also I could‚Äôve sworn it 4-tapped me, but may have been teamshooting
---
Looks pretty shady to me, or your friend is as bad at crucible as I am lol. 
---
Yeah I'm sure its bungie, not you dying immediately after your kills.
---
uhhhhh
---
It is though. I‚Äôm not dying right after kills
---
Did you enjoy the game play of y1? Not the amount of content. But the gameplay. If you did. Then yeah. The new stuff is great. If not then don't bother. 
---
Mercy rule only comes when one team has less then 30, and the other at 90 or above, iirc.
---
that shit was easy lol idk what you guys are talking about. the first curse quest in d1 before they made it easy mode was a difficult crucible quest 
---
Still better than if I drew one, good job man 
---
Thank you! Moments like these are why I love destiny, it brought true teamwork into play
---
No mercy, only tears  
---
I just want oem nerfed
---
Nada really, hoping to turn them all in and get something exotic lol
---
Well i have my answer for why i can't purchase the annual pass. I just bought the standalone forsaken a few months ago. And i have problem to buy it on xbox when he comes out.
---
Scourge set.
---
I use my QB ammo on hydras just so they dont explode on my idiot teammates.
---
one of the blue frames under the black armory frames
---
I enjoy Gambit, so Breakneck, Malfeasance, I let those slide. Ace was a fucking drag to do and now TLW will kill me. I‚Äôm absolute garbage at Crucible so feelsbadman 
---
Wish granted mate 
---
Why they gotta kill all the fun before I get a warlock going 
---
Damn I downloaded fortnite on my Xbox to play with a friend and it took three days 
---
Quick play has been bending me over raw with 4 stacks. It hurts as a Chaos Reach main ;-;
---
Oh sweet thanks for the heads up
---
If you throw a nova bomb. And it is shot by the golden gun. It vanishes, doesnt explode.  Kills no one. Altered mayhem a lot
---
Yo could I join if y‚Äôall have space?
---
anyone explain?
---
What super would I a titan use to get reliable super kills? I got all of em
---
Can confirm, Kay?
---
The beginning was suspicious, so it‚Äôs a possibility.
---
Also, can we talk about your friend‚Äôs aim?
---
After I posted I figured someone may have been farming lol.
---
You can do a bounty for tess that will give you a prismatic matrix you know. Thats how i got mine
---
That‚Äôs just how it works. Same way that switching special weapons to a primary will delete all special ammo 
---
I feel ya mate.
---
5 more games for 25 medals, yeah no. I *actually* don‚Äôt play crucible and it took me 5 mayhems to get 10 medals.
---
Best superhero ever. 
---
I think the major problem is the Shards of Galanor. It's too easy to use it to kill one enemy and get the whole thing back in an instant.
---
Thanks I found out a little earlier and the amount of crucible just made me wanna go to be and resume tomorrow,
---
But I happen to like the jump what's wrong with that?
---
Same, I just came back and want to PvP but I'm stuck at 1% because I'm still sub 1.0 KDR typically.
---
Neat. Im really glad you posted, because most people tend to say how much they want something to change, but dont put any thought into how it would change. You dont just say something should be different, but rather you actually thought of some ideas of how to put that into practice!
---
D2 Vanilla was pretty much entirely a primary game, as all specials were locked under heavy. But people kept wanting specials again and again begging for shotguns back.
---
So here we are, in a shotgun meta because of players. We got double primary in vanilla because of feedback in D1 from some players really wanted primary duels, and got shotguns because people didnt want primary duels but shotguns and specials back. 
---
I personally just stick to a sniper and primary, usually a hand cannon. Usually shotguns are predictable enough that I have no problems.
---
With any luck there might be some middle ground where all people just settle down and are okay with it.
---
Anyways great having this conversation with you man, I appreciate your thoughtful reply!
---
Is Talons Of The Eagle part of the update too?
---
I have a Outlaw/Rampage one and if it's viable I'd rock it 
---
Serious question. Why did you buy a PvE game for the PvP
---
Precision hasn't been touched, still suck
---
Its actually much easier in quickplay. It least it was for me a titan.
---
Thanks
---
Ok, didn't know if they made anymore changes because I ran into one on my 2nd match this week and lost and can't get another one to spawn.
---
Far as I'm aware the buff was across the board for scouts. Since scouts in general just kinda got... Forsaken... *Wheeze*
---
Anywho, I hope so because I have that roll on a TotE and I'd love to use it
---
Yeah I figured out why I couldn‚Äôt find them and it‚Äôs working again and I just did like 10 of them? I‚Äôve done more then 100 on Xbox and I‚Äôve never gotten exotics from it infact I can only recall one engram at all 
---
Slpa slap slap
---
Goodbye blade barrage
---
Way of the Outlaw is my friend now
---
Telesto users were trash
---
Sticking honest to the lore, only hunters are getting this gun then. 
---
Thorn is probably gonna be the Jokers Wild exotic quest. There is a free season exotic quest though. Juat most likely wont be Thorn as its tied to the Drifter and his story.
---
You need friends who will actually try and well just aim for the head
---
Stick with your teammates and team-shoot.
---
Oh, and stick with your teammates. 
---
Also. Do private matches count towards bounties?
---
K I can get my clan to help. Thanks!
---
Stay cautious
---
Dont go all in - stay focused and aim ur shots
---
If u see an enemy - keep ur distance b/c his teammate May be with him
---
Look behind u and dnt always be out in the open
---
Take it slow - its alright if u get like 5-6% each game, thats still progress
---
Try out different weapons to see which work best with u and in crucible
---
Stay with ur team all the time - the enemy wont spawn in where ur entire team is at, so stay with them before u get ganked
---
The helmet stayed on

Lol, I was ~520 and really wanted to do the wells to get another Seed of Light. So I was standing there waiting and a guy came in to start the event. He inspected me, shot at me, and then shook his gun to say "no" and then left. Cracked me up.
---
Oh a mod! Thanks though for the help!
---
Ye, exotic engrams are assigned to a kill counter once you get 2200 kills (only approx.) there is a guaranteed spawn. In EP you can easily get the kills. I did like 30 level 6 &amp; 7 runs and got 3 exotic engrams, all of them were telesto tho...
---
HEY WO WO HEY STILL BEST AID CONTROL HANDCANNON CHANGE MY SCREAMING MIND
---
Yeah I know, as I have it. I'm just wondering if it'll count towards the quest step completion, like the redrix quest step completion from 5 valor resets.
---
Paid content never disappears.
---
And no, private matches won't count. 
---
Yeah the one about how his teammate might be behind him happens a bit to me. Glad I got tons of info from this. Thanks my dude!
---
Helmet stayed on
---
Rip I got 2 god rolls 
---
Ive had 2 rolls just like that on kindled and plenty of other complete trash rolls on forge weapons..
---
Teamshoot, teamshoot, teamshoot
---
Only got buffed damage in PvE. It's still the same damage for 150rmp scouts in PvP. I was sad too as I have a talons of the eagle in my vault I want to use.
---
I got the base game for a buddy new from GameStop for free. It was $5 and I had some kind of rewards thing. 
---
Well said Mod
---
Agreed in all regards - those are my EXACT complaints on it as well. 
---
Not really 
---
It has the same chance as any other race of prime evil in the curse week.
---
I completely forgot about her holy shit 
---
I hope she kills me, too
---
Been doing that when I started and helps so much. Thanks for reminding me!
---
Are you aiming? Never aim with the Last word
---
I think killstreaks give more
---
To be fair I was one of those Hunter running with my shards of g on
---
Edit: hunters*
---
Hmm I tried the top void one till i kept getting close quarters maps
---
Do Mayhem, camp with golden gun or something, get a few kills, then hide again until next super. Should be able to go positive if normal gunplay isn‚Äôt your thing. 
---
You can switch based on map
---
same
---
Just salty noobs lol
---
I know but I had been getting just close quarters maps and broken sight ones
---
Sadly that's bungos rng for ya
---
Y
---
Same problem. Spent forever trying to unlock the forge and now I can‚Äôt collect compound ether for the frame. 
---
Just aim
---
Just wanted to say thank you for that, I‚Äôve been stuck on this step for over 2 hours and I‚Äôve reset my system and app and nothing helped but doing what you did helped me a lot and I applaud you:)
---
Do not do this, it is a horrible idea, and I know from experience. If you aren't a hunter with a team full of Blade Barrages, then you're fucked. Do quickplay, it is much, much, much easier and you gain a ton more percentage
---
Yup I like cq right now ive been playing with Cerberus +1 it was helping me get assists earlier with the random spread
---
No. Would be much worse
---
Ya fuck this shit
---
Wow, downvoting for having a question. Toxic in in the morning, I guess. 
---
 C
---
You're right, should have thought of that. 
---
I've actually changed the title, so it's kind of a hybrid now, it used to be something like: "Got it at last...word", don't remember exactly what I wrote.
---
Anyway, thanks.
---
For a gun with so much lore behind it I really expected at least a unique mission area and some creativity, not just 'kill hive, kill guardians, farm lost sectors and public events, kill guardians.'
---
The quest is hot fucking garbage. 'Oh but it should take skill to get.' No, it shouldn't. LH and NF take skill to get, and they are so much better than TLW that it's not even worth using. They brought it back because it was a crowd favourite, not so there would be a new pubstomper, but literally half the crowd will be hardstuck on step 2 for a long time, and some will never get past it, ever.
---
The quest for thorn is most likely already made or at least planned. Hopefully they wont exclude 50% of the playerbase from something that will be the only thing keeping people playing past the last few weeks of the season.
---
Well he made a valid point, you were a jerk. 
---
The paint on the side looks like you killed a bunch of vex in one area 
---
Those types of comments make me want to kms.
---
Probably stompees 
---
My 150 scouts are mopping the floors in crucible. Haven't checked other archetypes yet, having too much fun. 
---
For the love of god don‚Äôt make bungie nerf another warlock super. We‚Äôre still bruised and bloodied from the update.
---
Still seems to track behind cover and around corners
---
Shards got nerf'd aswell IIRC  
---
Have not seen how much it actually affects super return
---
Got mine 2 times and I didn't touch gambit since 4 weeks. I simply can't motivate myself to go through hell again.
---
 visit www.caydecompany.com &amp; get LAST WORD  
---
Thats cool. You have about 4 weeks to enjoy max LL before it will be raised to 700.
---
Thorn lol. Think I did it with a blue void shotgun and the word of Crota hand cannon. Pain in the ass.
---
it felt that way for me in QP as i felt if assists counted as a positive to the numbers of kills too i should of been a higher %. as when i was playing i would count final hit kills vs deaths in my head n try to stay in the positive k/D wise specially in rumble. but then again even tho im keepin positive /efficient 1-2.0 it still feels like im back pedalin % wise some how.
---
idk maybe im not counting right n just stressed from this step cuz seems no one else as reported varyin numbers/odd counts 
---
Suros. I'll give you 5 words to specify how amazing high RPM ARs are.
---
Doctrine of Passing Pre nerf. 
---
Base damage of six shooter 
---
(and in PvE 40% more GG damage to bosses)
---
New bullets on kills with six shooter
---
Bigger crit buff in the bottom tree (after a crit kill), also more super recharge from the bottom tree headshot buff.(2 more stacks and more regen)
---
So far the annual pass was very disappointing. Dunno if it will get any better...
---
"good sir" ffs talk like a normal person.
---
yup. 99% of d2 is easy mode compared to d1. There are a few good challenges, but most of the things people whine about being hard in d2 really aren't. Literally all you have to do crucible wise for last word is have either a positive kd or break even, since trades still give more then they take away from points. Then it's just a few games of mayhem to get the medals. easy peasy. nothing hard about it
---
Lol IKR?
---
But atkeast I can enjoy it for now xD
---
when running escalation protocol and farming weapons, do you need the key for the weapons?
---
I had tried that gun a few weeks back but I wasn't really impressed so Ill give it a try now. 
---
I'm mainly wondering if Cerberus has received a buff because that gun was fun to use but wasn't really competitive.
---
Shoot a nova bomb down? How? I tried many times. Thunderlord, rockets,potg.
---
I once shot 6 grenades into it thinking it would stop. It didn't.
---
If you're doing the mission where you are getting the "golden age CPU" under Titan you can wait there and you'll see a massive worm swim by under the sea that's xol+ size, everything about it is a mystery
---
I like Crimson better. Like a Red Death Bad Juju hybrid.
---
Haha funny joke right???  RIGHT!!!?? You cannot be serious 
---
FYI the SotP Scout rifle can roll with Box Breathing and is an absolute beast in PvP. 
---
Yeehaw 
---
That‚Äôs impossible, the crucible isn‚Äôt a hard step you‚Äôre just bad at the game
---
Uhhhh what
---
Only scout I tried in PvP is Black Scorpion and it shreds. TTK is very fast if you can land headshots. Mida is also pretty good, haven't tested it too much but it feels great so far.
---
For what I know there are currently only 3 LMG's in the game:
---
* Thunderlord (randomn drop exotic)
---
* Avalance (legendary that you got from the dawning event, don't think you can get it now)
---
* Hammerhead (legendary that you get from play black armory forges).
---
So yes, you need to be extremely lucky or get the season pass
---
Yes
---
Everyone I played with last night had this happen.  And usually at the worst time.  
---
BAMF
---
Yeah curated always drop bergusia
---
Look lol the kill objectives actually make sense with the quest steps and lore cards, have you even read the lore and descriptions or mindlessly clicking to get it over with.
---
Also camping and letting your team die is stupid just play normally and stick together, I highly doubt there are ACTIVE people trying to get you killed for the medal when in reality its much easier to get this step completed by killing the guy who killed you, every game 4-5 medals makes this quest step easy and entertaining. Stop taking it personally, read the lore and put 1+1 together and stop crying when the content released isn't specifically tailored to your lazy ass self.
---
DESTINY HAS ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT GRINDING... im surprised there are so many of you who have yet to understand that.
---
AND NERF? lol... I highly doubt that maybe some QOL fixes in the future for console but overall this is the most balanced version of the gun to date and fits very well with the current lunas howl/not forgotten shotgun meta providing a much more reasonable counter to close quarters combat.
---
also the gun has piss poor range, when you ads you are very likely to miss a shot and when hip firing it reduces even more to 20 meters you will get out classed by most pulses and hand cannons at medium range so stick to the original intended purpose of using it as a close quarter weapon and also not running in ape first with a shotty (running in a straight line of all strats) the complaining about how "op" it is when someone is camping with it lol
---
Geeze. I've found the Jotunn twice, would rather an exotic though.
---
Let's view this as a restricted everyone
---
Yeah I dont know, I appreciate the help though!
---
Yeh, also that total raids sherpa'd and not just last wish
---
Same.
---
I'm saying the same thing.  Like, what is the issue here?  Just do the bounty for Prismatic Facet and get it.  That's what I did.
---
I wanted the ship and it gave me the ornament instead :(
---
I had four potential items this week; a 1/4 chance of getting it. And BOI didn't I get the Laconic! :D. I made sure to thank RNGesus afterwards too.
---
Ikelos shot gun an the osprey i was sick when it was on nightfall an the secrets banner from the D city three things an im wayfairer 
---
Got it on lock last week and Hunter this week, I don't play too much, just for powerful rewards
---
On the roadmap TLW is listed under annual pass content, SPOILERS: Under jokers wild there is one quest for free, (thought to be thorn) and one for annual pass, (supposedly Rose, thorn before the corruption), and Penumbra apparently will have Hawkmoon for everyone free
---
I got this too yesterday.  I have never seen the point in posting up that you got a weapon.  Just me.  You do you.  
---
ttk is great at close range but the again only if you let them have an easy shot at you, shade step, titan skate, warlock dash whatever the means it is likely that they will have to use 6+ shots on you giving you plenty of time to get close and one bang them with that matador64 :)
---
Stormcaller, nova warp, and dawn blade are all solid for crucible 
---
So you're saying that if someone has empowering rift(which nobody runs in crucible) and lunafacation boots(which nobody runs in crucible) and well of radiance (which nobody runs in crucible) the the gun is OP? Seems awfully specific and very situational and probably won't be used much.
---
Love it, deserves more upvotes
---
Stuck with g lance since day one, treats me right 
---
Yooooo that goat just fucked that guys day up
---
I did the lost sectors as well while waiting.  Worked out pretty well.  Finished both parts of the quest about the same time.  
---
damn boi he thicc
---
The quest at the end, it has unique mechanics.
---
Really upset with the amount of cosmetics, both armor, and sparrows, ships, ghost shells, emblems, shaders, that are either pointless now, worse then others, or straight up not obtainable anymore 
---
Why don't humans have a navy anyway, surely that would be better to fight off the cabal
---
I tried out a does not compute / persuader combo and it felt amazing 
---
Just hide 4head
---
Shoot his gun
---
Polaris is kicking ass in PvE
---
You called my rant stupid but literally just re stated my points lol, I never said last word was leaving, never said thunderlord was unobtainable, and you assume the only solar LMG will be back ‚Äúshrugs arms up in the air‚Äù 
---
Damnit, I‚Äôve gotten 3 Jotunns and no curated rolls. Looking for the kindled orchid too. Do they have to be gold frames or can it be a silver frame?
---
So we have to motivate you to grind for guns to do more things you're not motivated to do? 
---
Yes I did kill him all three plates but my mission says to find him even after he is dead.
---
I think that was the glitch just do it again
---
I‚Äôm a pve player as well, but I like to play pvp, and I‚Äôve had mine now for a week, I really love the thing and I got the roll I wanted. (fluted Barrel, armor piercing, range masterwork, backup mag.) but congrats! You‚Äôll really like the thing ad control. Plus without desperado active it still a comfortable weapon. And whenever it is active I usually like to just fire off all my shoots while I can.
---
So you're upset that events gives you rewards, and you didn't take part in the event? Feels like complaining about not getting a Christmas gift when you lock all your doors on Christmas and now you have to wait till next Christmas to get some.
---
r/destinyfashion maybe this will help
---
Memes are so good when they‚Äôre terribly incorrect
---
If you heard it, it wasn‚Äôt from Bungie. 
---
In my opinion there‚Äôs just way to much time exclusive loot that you can never get again, the system fucks over everyone, there‚Äôs super awesome cosmetics that you don‚Äôt have, that I may have, and vice versa, most people probably don‚Äôt have things that they find amazing and then have to get bummed it‚Äôs gone forever, and even if you were here during the event like my friend was, getting the snowball ghost shell for example was pure chance I believe, and even tho he was here he couldn‚Äôt get it, idk why your assuming all event items will be back next time the event is here, and not just replaced with other stuff, I mean a gun literally being timed exclusive is as far as it can go, the only possible next step would be making exotics timed exclusives 
---
Nice bait. Up vote. 
---
MIDA is a 4 tap and I love it 
---
Uhh...really. Thanks for the help.
---
I just did everything in qp...where there was about 50 less blade barrages to contend with. Lots of kills in mayhem but a shit ton of deaths too. 
---
It is a stupid rant. I mean your only point worth a damn was the Avalanche but I got like 20 of them because the event was nearly a damn month long. If you weren‚Äôt playing then of fucking well it‚Äôll be back next year but who cares because by then there will most likely be one that actually has decent stats. 
---
You get what loot grinding games are about, right? And events?
---
Something off-topic, suros regime is pretty good now woth fast firing. 
---
Have a nice day ;)
---
I wouldn't worry about anything cosmetic, particularly shells and shaders. I have stuff from the last crimson days unlocked through bright engrams, but I didn't start playing until late July.
---
Anything like armor and ornaments seems to come back up through eververse.
---
I‚Äôd offer to help, but I loathe hyperbole. Send me you gamer tag in a message and I‚Äôll see if it‚Äôs really as bad as you say...if it is I‚Äôll help too
---
I love Persuader! 
---
Wow dude I think You‚Äôre on to something?ü§î
---
Whatever floats your boat fellow guardian, no one is forcing you ofc. but since i have the breakneck i havent found anything that comes close to it
---
Got a feeding frenzy / rampage Warden's Law after the patch and it's amazing, love it. definitely recommend farming it if you love HC's
---
Nicely done!! Definitely deserves more upvotes! Here‚Äôs mine
---
If you have the Destiny companion app it has a list of what ones you have left to do, and/or if you go to the destinations tab your milestones are marked by a gold symbol.
---
[This](https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2018/09/13/destiny-2-forsaken-here-is-every-powerful-engram-for-last-minute-raid-power-grinding/#1a39e3f65fb3) seems to be an okay list.
---
And u/ImpliedShrimpz always posts [this graphic](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/al2hcx/yeehaw_guardians_here_is_your_weekly_reset_for/) on reset every week that would probably help.
---
just a spoon full of sugar helps the medicine go down, the medicine go down
---
Did you just "bounce" off his shield? Or were you trying to boop him?
---
 Vouchsafe is awesome! I have one that has full auto, exp payload, with steady rounds and it does good! Even in pvp! And I busted out that old iron banner rapid fire scout from collections that has dragonfly and HCR for which seems to be a beast as well.
---
I don‚Äôt have the shell and the ornament for LW so I‚Äôm so nervous to open it üòÇ
---
Why not?
---
&gt;all you have to do is play gambit and kill ads with an AR  
---
that's the painful part
---
Are you not trying to join the population of ‚Äúbabies bungie listens to‚Äù by demanding this quest be different because you don‚Äôt like it?
---
I felt like a total dirtbag for getting the ornament, since I barely had any of the listed items...
---
I had 3/4 potentials but got that LW ornament too :D 
---
Same :)
---
And that's why hunters don't blink anymore
---
Congrats, I am ever so close as well Just Flipped my 4th Reset last night. 1 more to go
---
https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-12-19-destiny-2-power-level-500-650-level-cap-4747
---
I didn't use my prismatic last week so used that and got LW ornament :) Just means i can get 2 tries next week or go for something else this week.
---
Yeah, unfortunately not everyone can appreciate the fine details of a comedian.
---
Thank you :-)
---
Cuz I‚Äôm terrible at crucible and I can‚Äôt get past 20% 
---
I gotta test out my god roll No Feelings and see how it goes
---
And PV standing there just all "what the fuuuuuck?"
---
Shattered throne is the only dungeon atm. And it's only available a certain week in the 4 week cycle. 
---
for starters, the Prestige Lair energy weapon is scout rifle
---
yeah it's still shit
---
Random caps make your points less valid.
---
I used a cut and run and a does not compute. Honestly I couldn‚Äôt really tell a difference 
---
r/totallyexpectedoverwatch
---
Not on console it aint.
---
Draw him a smiley face and tell him: "I made this for you".
---
You're such clickbait. &lt;3
---
Got any tips on the final mission?
---
I don't think anyone is saying this is the biggest sandbox update ever..
---
I will say that this update drastically improved Scouts and nerfed the shit out of telesto. I didn't get one shotted from telesto all day. The supers have definitely become noticeably different. Blade Barrage feels 100% different, so does Shards. Gunslinger is awesome. Nova Warp has been murdered. I haven't tested AR's yet. And honestly, I shut down 2 specteral blades yesterday.
---
Obviously they didn't change the whole game around, but there were some huge changes. No sanbox update will ever be as big as the one back in March when they buffed all the exotic weapons and made Graviton Lance the meta.
---
THE god roll. 
---
And normally I'm pretty decent at crucible.
---
NOT.
---
FUCKING
---
NOW!
---
TOO MANY TRYHARDS!
---
ace&gt;TLW
---
You need to have really specific rolls for Halfhan to be good. I'd recommend either Suros or some rapid fire Scouts. Scout rifles feel amazing rn.
---
Correct
---
...that all misses by inches behind the warlock cuz they don't know how to shoot for shit
---
This isn't an LFG sub.
---
Rule 13.
---
/r/Fireteams 
---
Oh lord. I want that so badly.
---
I feel sorry for you if all you do in destiny is PvE shit. Like, how fun is it doing the same shit over and over every day? At least in PvP, players provide different skill levels and challenges; whereas PvE is literally the same AI over and over again. 
---
For myself, and a **much larger PvP playerbase then you realize**, Destiny is a ‚Äòdo the grindy PvE stuff, so you can enjoy the PvP‚Äô game. 
---
#Anthem is a PvE game, Destiny is literally both PvE &amp; PvP
---
I can tell you I'll absolutely be using it two days for the prestige and then promptly tossing it in the vault and pulling out Monarque. 
---
me when my clan leader got 1 for each character last reset 
---
If PvP wasn't so awful because there's no matchmaking system and it's P2P connection, there'd be a whole lot less complaints about gear being put behind PvP requirements.
---
Those shields need health bars, honestly.
---
Good to know
---
lmao
---
I tested out distant relations yesterday and in my opinion it still feels pretty weak. It  definitely doesn‚Äôt  feel like much has changed from before and after the patch but I‚Äôll try other scouts. 
---
I ran double shotgun for that lol. More deaths and more kills, better chance for revenge medals
---
"I'm Mary Poppins Ya'll!"
---
Nah...just Shattered Throne, the rest I can do whenever. 
---
I replayed it and just now noticed how awful the replacement voice actor for Cayde was. It sounded NOTHING like him. They should get Cayde‚Äôs original voice actor to go back and dub over this mission
---
Get out of my head 
---
I run it with Monarque for pvp. Throw down an empwering rift you get marked targets with sanguine and radar ads and the empowering rift makes Monarque a one shot as long as the poison kicks in. 
---
I'm thinking Thursday, weather providing
---
What would be considered a solid scout or pulse? I haven‚Äôt played in a while. 
---
Your*
---
You're 100% correct
---
I was missing 4 things, and still got the ornament. It was so satisfying,
---
I got the ornament and now I feel bad because there is no way in hell I am ever going to be able to get the LW
---
The dmg bump is noticeable in PvE and a rampage/outlaw Cut and Run felt super good in Lake of Shadows last night. Definitely lower dps than aggressive PRs but much easier to manage and great for clearing snipers.
---
I was using MIDA last night and it was pretty good!
---
Mmmm The classic bait and switch 
---
I mean the Breakneck and Loaded Question may as well be exotics, along with Luna‚Äôs and Not Forgotten. They totally could each be exotic, but they‚Äôre legendary just for the sake of letting you *also* run an exotic. They may not be the shiny yellow, but they‚Äôre just as good as any exotic
---
You just convinced me to try it... And I've been a tether main since Rise of Iron. 
---
They‚Äôre almost as bad as shriekers. Almost. 
---
I used the Raid Scout last night and It did pretty well.  Mine has rampage and triple tap on it.  It was doing much better.
---
Thx. I'm hoping to knock out my other two completions today. I'm also curious if they plan on doing anything else with those other rooms after you beat the final boss and drop down. There's 4 hallways but only one for the chest.
---
Does anyone have the gif of this moment?
---
Yeah finished it at like 8, did Shattered Throne for my Izanagi‚Äôs quest then pretty much stopped existing for the night
---
Anything that kills some Guardians is ‚ÄúOP‚Äù!! Otherwise they can‚Äôt die, MLG players never die from skill!!
---
Yep though having fun in mayhem tethering not really needing to win (already reset five times) to get the quick play part filled in  
---
Not after the nova warp nerf they aren't
---
Accurate as fuck. Also, as a related statement... Noob players shouldn't be tempted by Mayhem for this quest. Unending blade barrage sounds sweet, but in reality... Not so much. 
---
I got stuck with the "never ending initializing" bug when I tried to update the game last night.  I ended up having to uninstall and reinstall.  My internet was slow last night... it took me like 3 hours to download the game.

Warcult Endgame on my Warlock and Crucible Solemnity on my Hunter.  üëç
---
At first I was like nooooo, but it‚Äôs not that hard. Keep your k/d ratio positive and you will have it in no time
---
I love you 
---
The gun is just not that good. No need to be a prick.  And I‚Äôm diamond in multiple playlists with around a 2kd.  My aim is fine.  The gun is just pretty sub par.
---
Basic milestones that give power engrams 2-3 light above max light:
---
Dailies-Rest on a 4 day rotation. Todays reset is Strike, tomorrow is Gambit, Friday is Crucilble, and Saturday is Heroic Adventure, then it starts over with strike on Sunday. (If you do these every day you can get 7 power engrams a week from them.)
---
Flashpoint
---
Clan Reward-5000 clan XP turned in. (If you are not in a clan you need to join one.  There are up to 5 engrams you can get each week that you are missing out on.)
---
Ikora Weekly- 20 bounties turned in
---
Ikora Daily Heroic Missions- Do 3.
---
Strikes- 3 with same subclass as a teammate
---
Nightfall
---
Nightfall score over 100K
---
Gambit-Complete 3 matches
---
Gambit weekly bounty from the Drifter
---
Crucible-complete 5 matches (not private)
---
Forsaken &amp; Black Armory milestones give power engrams 3-5 light above max light:
---
Spider gold wanted bounty-cost 5 ghost fragment to get.
---
Petra Weekly-Complete the 2 weekly bounties (Ascendant Challange &amp; Gateway of the Worlds)
---
Weekly bounty quest- Complete 8 daily Petra bounties
---
Weekly mission quest-Complete the weekly mission
---
Weekly Ascendant Challange bounty- Complete it
---
1st Heroic Blind Well completion.
---
Shattered Throne, every full curse week (when Petra is in Rhesilvia)-each boss gives one, so 3 available.
---
Last Wish Raid-Gives 5, I think
---
2 power weapon frames from Ada
---
Completion of the 2 frames gives power armour drop
---
Scourge of the Past Raid- gives 3
---
If you have a piece of gear that is more than 20 light below max, buy a new one from collections (just a blue will do, so that your max light increases, you do not have to wear it).
---
If you have a piece of gear that is more than 5 light below max, you should do the basic stuff first.  With the fabulous RNG in the game, you are likely to get pieces that do not help you progress so you are minimizing your loss by doing the lower ones until ou get the piece you need.
---
If all of your pieces are within 4 ligh of each other, do the Forsaken/Black Armory stuff first.  These will give you higher jumps in light and help you progress faster.
---
If you have not created your alts yet, you should.  Use your booster on one to get them to lvl 30 instantly.  You will be ready to start Forsaken.  Since you can swap weapons between characters you can put your higher light guns (once the character is high enough) on the new characters to get their light up (buy from collections to make it go quick).  Always start the week with your highest light character, and move the guns as you switch.  Your lowest will probably be your highest next week to start.
---
has anyone taken the Polaris Lance into Crucible yesterday?
---
I feel your struggle but here is the break down
---
Kill= +2
---
Death= -1
---
Asst= +1
---
Trade = 0
---
So along as you play defensively and if you know your gonna die try to atleast trade
---
I felt like I was killing a pathetic lunatic by the end. Like, he totally needed putting down. But I didn't feel heroic. It was like taking out someone that was already basically dead. 
---
....or how I learned to love the travelers light
---
I'll see you lads at the landfill shortly!
---
The truth hurts
---
I disagree.  I think Mayhem is a super optimal (see what I did there?) game mode for the quest.  It seems like a 1.0 KDR will advance the quest, so someone unaccustomed to PvP can hide, get their super up, and then be almost guaranteed at least a trade.  ...for the latter pvp step, the quick and crunchy nature of mayhem made the medals REALLY easy.  I think I got the 25 in about 4 games.
---
Ther are only 9 cats.  Once you have given a gift to the cat it disappears forever.  These are account based not character based.  So if you have already done all 9, you can just delete the gifts.  If not, there are videos that will show you where all 9 are located.  Shouldn't take long to find them, gift them, and be done with them.
---
Eh people who walk into tethers with their supers active have it coming. Sunbreakers, golden gun, storm callers, and sentinels, should be able to destroy the tether without getting near it.
---
there was post in the anthem subreddit that i saw and somebody commented that this quest caused them to put down the game because they were so upset that they had to play pvp to get the gun.
---
Easily missing the best parts of the story. 
---
Your argument falls flat tbh. 
---
i do concur
---
But is it any good?
---
Was it a shit show on reddit?
---
Still waiting for it to come down in price a bit. :( 
---
Because it's to tease and entertain the idea that thorn is coming back and what that means for shin malphur and the drifter next season. All the PVE stuff is to build up the lore and the tension between those two characters. 
---
this is true. unless you decide to use a sniper for whatever reason
---
It is the first time to my knowledge that we actually see it happen, but several of (the more humorous) lore entries talk about how some Guardians have zero regard for their own safety and are willing to die practically for their own amusement.
---
So yes, we're just as hilariously suicidal in canon.
---
Not surprised lol
---
I dont even know why I'm here anymore. Im here for the lore and even then im floundering.
---
You have to do raids to get anarchy and 1KV, and what makes the last word any different from lunas howl apart from the rarity? Why should all exotics be accessible to everyone?
---
What cloak is that on your hunter? 
---
That's what I did for the quest lmao 
---
I was never good at that. Apparently I have to learn it now.
---
It's not just me. And yes. People have tried precision, sniper kills, black armory weapon kills, even black armory sniper precision kills. Nothing
---
Exactly loved shooting them on ceilings then waitinv for some dumb titan or a floaty boi to try and cast their super only to be pulled right out because the jumped 
---
Indeed. Having this issue atm
---
Thx buddy 
---
Nope, Dead Orbit did. Like I said, black and white shaders. But then New Monarchy won the next few.
---
Any way we can use this without buying silver?
---
We'll miss u buddy ü§†üëä 
---
SBMM is how you can matched against people at your level you get better and rank up and move up the ladder getting better  gradually just like in sports etc you dont match up a beginer against a pro repeatedly and say git gud.
---
O wait the sweaty's moaned and got SBMM removed from QP so I guess the answer is dont play.
---
You‚Äôre gonna carry that weight. 
---
In short.... Yes
---
I really want to see how you fair in a raid or a high Handicap Nightfall with this mindset....
---
Lmao same. 
---
Oh, damn! I haven't done that one yet. Nice.
---
Yes. You must finish the forsaken campaign until you get the awoken talisman for the first time. 
---
I can, but I'm gonna wait a while for everyone else to calm down so I can do it without breaking my TV in a fit of rage and frustration every time a titan shield gets thrown and misses me by 6+ feet and *still* kills me.
---
And seconds later my titan shoulders made this scene look extremely awful with the crucible armor.
---
"I will shoot you....if i manage to find the right angle to peek through the gaps!"
---
Plot hole: Cayde didn't need to die for the story to continue.
---
I'm not really sure about a fix to shards here... It's so much worse now you get killed by it a TON more. The knives track like crazy and you can rarely escape it around corners etc. 
---
Also OEM needs a rework. 
---
Yes it's a glitch  I got stuck there for 4-5 times 
---
Glad you got the easy one
---
Lol..I almost broke my controller:)
---
I got pheonix protocol as armor, and i lost the weapon names
---
Basically pulled a venom
---
thats not a real life thundercrash
---
but this is  :

Gun looks crap anyway its just a flashy hip fire HC. Why would anyone use that seriously? Meme gun
---
Im ashamed to say I watched it loop 3 times before I was like... oh.
---
&gt;you have the chance to catch them off guard
---
Except they have wall hacks... I usually bait them by running to base and waiting with a linear fusion. If I have less than 3 motes I'll go after them with a primary and try and buy my teammates a few minutes 
---
I masterworked my KC/Ramp/Dropmag/reload MW Transfiguration just cause i like the gun. Hope its worth using now.
---
[removed]
---
Look up dry mounting. You can get it do e at a frame shop. It flattens it out on a piece of foam board and takes out all the creases and stuff. 
---
They feel better, wouldn't say amazing, but they feel better. Some scout rifles finally fucking one shot adds. Nameless midnight might be really good if it finally drops with better perks for me lol.
---
But the exotic ones feel fine. Polaris lance will feel satisfying once i unlock the dragonfly perk on it.
---
I'm a warlock, but I know how you feel. I have yet to take my cayde bond off. It was a hard choice when I got a more powerful wing theorem with identical perks. Ended up just infusing because caydes looks too good to get rid of.
---
Bad post is bad
---
No you dont. I lose percent at .7 efficiency 
---
Actually, I do need an excuse to get a new controller...
---
It sure looks that way
---
Can you not do ++exoticDropRate in matlab?
---
I'm sure I will get hate for writing this, but I can't stand that so many people had last word against me in PVP on the 1st day the quest came out. I think it is bullshit. especially as someone who can't afford the annual pass.
---
That would be a better PVP load out This one with rampage is basically a Midnight coup for the poor man haha!
---
My reaction was "FUCK YEEEAAAAAHHHH"
---
Same! Got the Black Talon from a random drop while doing the lost sectors for the last word then got the last word!
---
Yeah I got that bit but when I‚Äôve that it says ‚Äú query failed 
---
Could not establish connection to the Xbox games store. New silver purchases will update when you next sign in‚Äù
---
Downvoted
---
And some people collect Exotics. Is there anything wrong with collecting Exotics?
---
Needs luck in the chamber 
---
Print Scr, over the arrows, if you're on laptop idk
---
It's a loot game, people don't mind grinding.
---
People do mind watching their grind progress evaporate because they keep getting thrown against 6 stacks with Luna's/Not Forgotten.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs only in bundles on the Xbox store 
---
Nice username
---
How do you get hunter shader
---
Ayyyyyyy üëâüòéüëâ
---
This is the same plothole as in the original Fallout 3 (with no DLC), where you're FORCED to suicide yourself "to be a hero" or whatever, when you have at least TWO people at your disposal, that are IMMUNE to radiation and could do the thing that you "need" to do, without dying...   
---
It's just shoddy writing when you create a setting where it's CANONICAL that you CAN'T DIE.
---
You literally need higher than a .5 kd
---
Well you are fucked. You need to purchase forsaken again. Its only on bundle unfortunetly. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Zoop üëàüòéüëà
---
What are you talking about
---
oops, sorry, forgot to say, TLW quest
---
*that's* not a super?
---
What kind of OP bullshit is that then? 
---
im probably the only hunter main that only uses middle tree for PvE 
---
I think hip fire would be more accurate since a shotgun does not have a scope.
---
I dont know your play style, obviously, but it worked for me to focus as much as possible on staying alive. Assists count towards it to so if you've got a friend or two to play with, you can run around team shooting everyone you encounter. 
---
That‚Äôs a big piss take then 
---
Is there anything support Could possibly do?
---
Sorry, your submission has been automatically removed. 
---
It appears you are asking a question about Destiny 2 error codes or a bug. 
---
We suggest Google searching your error code for more information about what you might be experiencing, or posting in /r/DestinyTechSupport
---
1. i dont have friends lol
---
2. thanks
---
Well can you tell where I can go to do this
---
Turn in crucible tokens and hope something you get comes with that shader then dismantle it.
---
lol just shoot around it 
---
Try rumble. Buddy was struggling in qp. Switched to rumble and got it done in 3-4 games 
---
Thanks! Ill try it
---
Hand cannons are tough because unless you have Lunas or not forgotten you will be crushed, even if you hit your shots. When I was doing the hand cannon kills part of the Luna quest I was using Trust and even though I'd hit 3 head shots in rapid succession, by the time I was lining up the 4th I was dead from a 3 tap. Hand cannons are also tough because you need to fight at closer range and that opens you up to shotgun and fusion rifles. Even an optimal hand cannon ttk will not stack up to instant ttk of a shotgun. What hand cannon are you using? 
---
Well put!
---
Don't call me Shirley in the Crucible!!
---
Yes my lord
---
You can kill yourself with it so, yeah, kinda sucks 
---
Trying it rn thanks
---
Upvoted 
---
Uhh, that tree is super good for pve. With shards? Amazing.
---
Yeah I was going just for Redrix and then I had to do the 25 competitive matches and I was like eh why not try for Luna‚Äôs, and I need to finish Redrix to focus on Luna‚Äôs completely, I‚Äôm sitting at 1118 points in comp,
---
That‚Äôs very weird have you tried buying it from the Xbox store on your computer browser?
---
Holy shit I forgot Lunafaction doubles your range...
---
Truly a guardian of culture and determination. Push harder and achieve greatness my sibling of light. 
---
Dude....for real..respect. I've been playin since day 1 and was never able to get to the cap before it was raised again. Got 650 about 2 weeks ago and it feels good...feels real good. Enjoy it and be proud of what you did! 
---
If you picked up the Black Armory Key Mold on a different character, you cannot reacquire it. 
---
10 wonderful legendaries 
---
yup, which is great! no more weekends and most importantly waiting for that dang public event, which seemed to take a week in and of itself lol
---
Nice! I happened upon my Queenbreaker right after I started a Bergusia forge last night :) Killed 2 dregs and it dropped! My engram slots were full, so I had to run the entire forge with the eagerness to find out what exotic was laying on the ground for me to claim.. I would have cried real tears if it was a dupe lol
---
The core root of the issue is about being forced to play Crucible to acquire yet another year two exotic weapon. Most don't care what they have to do in Crucible, but simply because they're forced to do it at all.
---
PC, eu timezone
---
and thanks!
---
"But Ace of Spades is Cayde's gun and Cayde was the best Hunter ever and he only used the best hand cannon ever and so you have to use it too because Cayde gifted it to you!"
---
\-every Cayde-6 neckbeard, ever
---
Besides.. Curated Nation of Beasts / Kindled Orchid, Malfeasance for anything Taken... Even a high-end roll on a Duke is probably better.
---
This was true to an extent but wins in QP literally mean nothing anyways. I always play to win but in QP I‚Äôm just in it for fun and to farm kills and KD not sweat out the W. 
---
Black Armory is not an event, therefore, it will be available until D2 is no longer supported, just like any other DLC content.
---
Thanks for the reply. Since it's Canadian the annual pass is probably more like $40. I will check out Amazon, but last I checked I didn't see any sales.
---
If I asked for a high-handicap NF run and someone brought Ace out and wanted to use it as a primary... They're out and they aren't coming back.
---
It's pretty much the *last* exotic I would consider anyone run for a difficult NF.
---
Took me an hour to get this done 
---
Well its..a crucible themed weapon..so..it makes sense to play crucible..? People are just mad that things require actual time investment and effort to achieve instead of just being delivered on a platter.
---
their feets mate, they even glow asking for it...
---
Thanks just wanted to make sure 
---
Hate to break it to you, but a hand cannon in the power slot would most likely be an exotic, preventing it from being used with TLW.
---
If you‚Äôre just in it for lore go to Ishtar Collective. 
---
I dont understand why they dont just roll factions back to their D1 functionality. It was cool representing your faction in crucible or whatever, having different gear sets to collect, etc.. they've been pretty useless for 90% of D2, faction wars were too short to really matter and nothing changed as a result of them. 
---
Same. I first got the game during the last faction rally, and ignored it after choosing one because I didn't know it was limited.
---
He would have gotten himself killed doing something else because he doesn't plan ahead.
---
Nice job!
---
Does it have to be flawless for the whole fireteam or just you?
---
You don‚Äôt even have to go positive is the funniest part about all these posts to me. 
---
I honestly didn't notice...
---
Unless it's blast furnace. Curated is headseeker which is kinda useless compared to my zen/killclip
---
Whole team, you activate the like a diamond challenge in the first area by pressing 6 buttons. If anyone dies, the whole fireteam is returned to orbit. 
---
This is the problem with mayhem its built for hunters yeet
---
/s
---
Yeah I updated the thing
---
Curated rolls will occasionally drop. It's what bungie considers the "exotic roll" or the best roll for the weapon
---
Mainly PVP, but also everything else
---
Your opinion and mine.... And almost anyone who has played with a decent roll. 
---
I know, right? I have a randomly rolled one with feeding frenzy and kill clip
---
Did your ps+ expire? I think the free version was tied to that but I‚Äôm not sure.
---
i know , all my characters are level 650. i was just seeing if it was still worth traveling to the tower every single time a prime dropped. have all the god rolled weapons i need, i just want some damn exotics, forsaken exotics to be exact.
---
To everyone saying The Last Word is shit on console..
---
#You aren't supposed to aim down sights
---
The gun is meant to be hip fired, just like in Destiny 1. Bungie may have failed in setting that up in Destiny 1, but now they've successfully created The Last Word the way it was meant to be used. This gun is not hard to aim hip firing, it's pinpoint accurate for the most part.
---
Fair response but you said you hate crucible. This isn't going to be fun if you hate crucible. 
---
*Flashbacks to the good ol days of D1*
---
18 deaths and I FUCKING DID IT 
---
Basically, you haven't play D2 if you haven't play Forsaken.  90% of the good are at Forsaken.  I also recommend the annual pass.  
---
Oh no, people will have to THINK before using Blade Barrage! It's officially unusable! 
---
Here's more of that helpful and non-toxic PVP community I keep hearing about.
---
i got it with an emblem as well, but im unable to use it
---
D2 is not becoming an e-sport...its nowhere to be found in that world.  Theres no high dollar tournments, just shitty one offs by god knows who on Battlefy.  Its not an e-sport, and it wont ever be one.  MLG has no Destiny tournments.    There is literally no movement on that front.
---
From what I heard, it's not actually a curated roll going to the postmaster, but a graphic bug showing it as curated of you have no slots full. 
---
Sweet!
---
I'd like that. I got a Jotunn last night. Cheered, ran around the Forge area with it and then went to bed because I was a sleepy Guardian. =\\
---
Cool man thanks for the info and congrats again 
---
peek*
---
I didn't realize you were required to use it only in Crucible.
---
Guess I need to stop right here then.
---
Thank you 
---
Woo, how about this weather we're having?
---
The amount of times this morning I've tried to contest the 1st heavy ammo drop with zero people following me and running into the entire enemy team is so high it hurts.
---
My Ringing Nail is almost exactly a Curated roll except for the Masterwork, which is Range rather than Stability.
---
It's still so damn good that I'm not going to chase the Curated version of it.
---
I saw a physics explanation on how if an unstoppable force and an immovable object were to meet, they would just phase though one another and this is evident of that.
---
Finally someone says what we're all thinking
---
Why not cayde's pistol?
---
Can anyone who has the quest and have not started any of it yet try and kill the Vex first?  I had obtained the weapon core first and then noticed the Vex weren't dropping anything.  I abandoned the quest and got a Pulse Rifle frame and instead of getting the Weapon Core first, started killing Fallen and those ARE dropping.  I'd like to see if anyone shot Vex first before getting the Weapon Core, or if it's still not dropping regardless?
---
I bought an Xbox One X a week ago. Upgraded the game files for two days just so I could play this mission again in 4K.  
---
Holy shit is this game beautiful.
---
Ikora did it for years if you read the lore

"So Lord Saladin and Lady Efrideet. He'll hate that I'm telling this story. But Lady Efrideet‚ÄîI like Lady Efrideet‚Äîshe tells me everything. We like our stories, and we like our helmets. So Efrideet, she lifts Saladin over‚Ä¶over her head. And she says‚Ä¶ She says, "I never miss." She lifts him over her head, and she throws him. And he cranks his Fist of Havoc. Their combined Arc energy singing like a drawn sword! Twenty miles down he plummets‚Äî into a Fallen Walker! He's like a‚Ä¶ like a cannon shot out of a friggin' anti-aircraft gun. Everything‚ÄîEVERYTHING explodes! Her Ghost was laughing when she revived him. They saved a whole village of people. This was the Dark Age. They had those. Villages. I miss those days. I miss‚Ä¶ Lady Efrideet."
---
Not sure where but there's a bit where Efrideet asks if she can throw Saladin again and he goes from "no" to "maybe".
---
What idiot wouldnt put a targeting adjuster and rhe high cal rnds on that go figure? Christ almighty
---
I usually use wings of sacred dawn or sunbracers for fire subclass and eye of another world for void or storm

I have FF/Rampage with the Meyrin RDL and Accurized rounds.. Not sure if I should chase FF/KC... I want it but do I want it *that* bad?

Yep.  Just looked it up on the d2 wiki. 
---
If you buy Forsaken, ordinary loot drops will raise your power level until you hit 500. From there you have to grind. This will put you well over the recommended power level for Leviathan, Eater of Worlds, and Spire of Stars, the three year 1 raids (the last two are "raid lairs," like raids but shorter). 
---
sitting over here, almost out of those dead orbit shaders...

Shattered Throne is available during the third week of the Dreaming City's three week cycle. You can tell which week it is by what the Dreaming City looks like. [Here is an album of screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/U3CvlXm) comparing the first and third weeks. If you don't want to physically travel there, look at where Petra is. 
---
The Strand: First, least cursed week
---
Divalian Mists: Second, middle week
---
Rheasilvia: Third, most cursed week.
---
Ya i only care for prime engrams for legendary shards since xur is always costing me so much
---
I feel you. It became comically upsetting how long it took.

But you did get it done!
---
True like if you agree
---
Yeah, thought so. As a working man, I guess it will be more time efficient to do that. Loving the game so far, so why not. Thanks!
---
My buddy's Prismatic Matrix looked like this too. Mine, on the other hand, had one or two of them checked off. I believe the facet I used yielded a clean, crisp purple sparrow.
---
I wish I could say I got it from the raid but I lack friends so I just opened the free chest and the weapon had it lol
---
Are you on PS4?

No pc

Ha!!!!! I agree...nay..... I VOW to only keep it Sexy on my next tip post!

Or more likely you are just a keyboard warrior safe behind the internet making stupid comments due to the insecurities you face in the home life, surfacing through video games ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Play slow, follow the group.  Try not to get frustrated, it takes time to find a groove.  
---
Not all maps are created equal.
---
Dont panic if you get killed, if you're like me and not that good at PvP find a decent weapon and stick to it.  It may take longer but you will get it done in about an hour or two.
---
Play quickplay
---
Gotcha. I need to finish the catalyst on PS4. Good luck tho. 
---
Gitfuked
---
You too
---
Why settle, get kill clip/ rampage orchid
---
I have an Outlaw/Dragonfly one that I want to put back into rotation. I enjoyed using it when it was weak. It should only feel even better.
---
Console player I bet
---
Oh ok thanks for tge info,  it helps out a lot.
---
Just watch out for that storm blanketing the northern US.
---
DO IT
---
Yes.  I know it‚Äôs a hip fire weapon, but what made it so fun in d1 was the fact that you could still ads effectively at close range.  On console the recoil is a bit much, on pc it‚Äôs no issue.  So yeah it‚Äôs totally more of a collectors item, don‚Äôt ever plan on using it in crucible or pve.
---
Stop playing Mayhem for that step.
---
Go into Quickplay. 
---
We're caught in a paracausal loop where we both keep responding and neither is unable to stop.
---
What if I am a keyboard warrior, armed with the finest Logitech gear money can buy?

No you plumhead,i mean ive seen you somewhere before *before* i posted that on r/pornhubcomments
---
Oh, huh. What sub u think it was
---
Completely agree. It‚Äôs total bullshit to gimp players intentionally. 
---
Last Word does require a different play style 
---
That roll doesn't even have high cal and the dude is on PC.
---
RIP you guys. Idk it feels like it was meant for hip fire and now it‚Äôs actually encouraged
---
I have no idea,it must have been a while back,i just had a bit of deja vu
---
I dont think he realized, no
---
what's the matter? Need to have the LAST WORD?

Huh thats wierd. I had the same thought
