If you are willing to drop like 90 bucks. The collectors edition for shadow keep is on sale again. And for the being nauseous. Try playing with the settings a bit. Especially motion blur.

---
Fill out this. Make sure you use your current psn and xbox accounts. And just follow the prompts. It will ask you at one point to select the account to be the primary, and that means which account will be accessible from the other accounts. So you'll select xbox, and then your xbox characters will be the only ones on your account, and signing in on ps4 will show those characters too.
---
Remember, use your current accounts, or the ones you play on. Using wrong or old accounts will give you headaches, you can stop the crosssave but you can't activate it again for something like 60-90 days. So get it right the first time and you'll be good to go.
---
exactly, Bank 5 immediately though, put some distance between you and the other team.
---
Making the game free was one of the biggest mistakes known to man.
---
Oh lord don't quit a match.
---
Log out and back in. If that doesn't fix it play another match. The log out should work.

950 drops all the time. 952 are the pinnacle bounties. Have you not done it yet?

Update your graphics drivers.
---
The game itself works fine. Whatevers wrong with performance will always be on the users end unless its a known issue.
---
I thought about it... but I dont like the taste of crayons.
---
Yep. He has no idea what to do first. And I said you can do anything you want. Crucible, Strikes, patrolling and doing public events. Literally anything will level you up, which is his true priority right now. 
---
Doing Forsaken campaign will lead you nowhere, bub. I know from personal experience.  
---
*Incoming short reply with insult due to lack of an inteligent reply*
---
The weapons models will forever be gone, but there wasn't anything exclusive about the traits, weapon or stats that they came with. You can easily get similar and better weapons.
---
We updated windows and gpu drivers. Along with tweaking in game settings. No matter what it stutters

Of course. Like everyone else here, +1 for asking. Destiny is a great community that loves to help.

It's like they did not care at all that you were there..
---
I see, that‚Äôs where he goes on tuesdays wednesdays and thursdays
---
What a coincidence, i literally just did the exact same thing, 20 kills without dying and ending up top. I'd show you but i can't comment with pictures.
---
You cant even join someone in the mission without doing the steps. No shortcuts
---
Depends. Do you have friends?
---
I know you really want the shell but I'm just keeping it 100 with you, that bitch blow up like shooting legos with a 50 cal. There just ain't no way to fix.
---
Literally anything or everything cayde said in forsaken before he died.
---
I believe everyone needs to have the fallen transponder to even start the mission.
---
Funny part is that this is the nr 1 google search result. Your point is mute
---
So to clarify....even tho I have the fallen transponder.....even tho I can start the mission to get outbreak perfected.....every one in my fireteam has to also have the fallen transponder in order to get outbreak perfected?
---
Might be a quest item you already got before. Were you playing with someone?
---
No but i did stormcaller to win from a clutch then dropped electric jazz hands in D1!
---
One run - just save the ada bounties and redeem them all at once
---
Here take 2 spare bolters and 1 heavy bolter for this heresy
---
I heard it's nerfed. True or power balanced? It used to two tap people before?
---
What?
---
What the cinnamon toast fuck
---
And I am one of those people, I've accepted the fact that I'll never get the last word and a few others but the massive amount of people complaining about iron banner and the constant please nerf this posts are ridiculous.
---
Kinda looks like the prismatic matrix
---
Omg thank u
---
I was. The gloves are the only armor i need for the warlock. But got the coldheart instead.
---
Probably easiest one to get is the Heraldic Shell. Was one of the first few I obtained as a New Light player.
---
The mag howl perk got nerfed, so the shot does less damage to stop from 2 tapping, still a 2 head 1 body shot though (as long as you get the 2 headshots before the body shot). They also got hit with the HC range nerf, so generally lunas is slightly better than not forgotten

Did you mean: Best of Year 1 engram?
---
So when you said good for new players but not ‚Äúepic gamers‚Äù you meant to say I‚Äôm upset because he didn‚Äôt bring something me for YOU. Some other ‚Äúepic gamers‚Äù might have every exotic in the game except one of these and they were probably pretty happy about it
---
Same.  FeelsRealBlindMan
---
I'm hoping so im at the 20 bounties and I've done way more than 5 so far
---
As long as you like yourself at the end of the day. That‚Äôs always the most important thing!
---
Guaranteed five shot kill at almost any distance in most Crucible maps.
---
I just transferred my stuff from bnet to steam yesterday night so I think u still can
---
Ya I guess also this my opinion
---
While I can agree that the story is a bit lacking. Your whole sentence structure  sucks....like a lot.
---
I've died from it though... It's possible just got to have really really low health
---
They need to raise it by 10 at least otherwise there‚Äôs no reason for those that have already reached 960 to keep playing certain activities for pinnacle gear
---
Yep! Thankfully. Though I'd keep your final reset waiting for when you reach that step, just to be safe! xD
---
As a small pp owner this isnt true, people who leave are huge dicks
---
Wtf does the title say?

Op probably means it's a chore.

---
Playing iron banner also helps alot
---
Me: Ooh cool engram 
---
Rahool: Here is your edge transit guardian.
---
They said they would do it before shadowkeep even came out...
---
Keep saving until you hit the soft cap, then spend them all and purge everything for legendary shards
---
I would rather be pulling grenades out of my ass, and I do that happily!
---
Vex offense is the activity you start from the moon director. It‚Äôs not actually on the moon patrol
---
Again refer to my post &amp; the cutscenes. Any person with a fucking brain can deduce that nobody has Sundance mounted on their wall.
---
I just added /s to my comments, I figured people would  know it‚Äôs sarcastic but I guess not lol... overall Destiny is a very easy game compared to other FPS games on PC. Supers are a big reason for that, being able to press one button and instantly delete people off the map without aiming... its basically cheese. And the gun play is very forgiving to begin with, massive bullet magnetism and giant hit boxes. I‚Äôm just saying there‚Äôs a reason Destiny isn‚Äôt an ESport game lol.
---
The 900 soft cap? Or 950?
---
Bank 10‚Äôs and 5‚Äôs to get to 25 banked ASAP and trigger an invasion, then punish the other team for not banking fast enough. Rinse and repeat for 50 and 75 notes. Win games.
---
Talons of the eagle, correct?
---
That perfect "A" placement though
---
I don't get how people use titan and warlock jump. Hunter gets you higher and farther
---
I‚Äòm still thinking that this is something captured from a game or a graphic designer idk. It looks so unreal
---
Got to legend this season and play from Aus, so alot of Asian players and I got to say from my anecdotal experience, they were pretty much all terrible
---
Welcome guardian! What platform you on?
---
Yes :)
---
Im just disappointed he's not having a 2-for-1 Riskrunner sale.
---
Looks like PC because of the mouse cursor
---
i dont want to promote the use of erentil but the cold fusion medal is super easy to get. its what i used
---
It says I need eyes on the moon complete. Which means I just have to follow those storms until I finish the quest right
---
I saw on the map where to go on the moon to active the quest (eventhough Eris icon was all blinky as if to say you should talk to her...).  Then I got the "tablets/guber whatever they called it" then went to up to the rock and to start the dialog with Eris.
---
And i was back on track.
---
The same reason there isn't a boot on both sides of the hunter strides.
---
14,000 points, not kills/medals.
---
Hey man, how's the holiday been? Got some sweet black Friday deals, picked up Death Stranding. It's super weird
---
Idgaf that they're shit I needed them
---
Our could be an essence, check your bounty tab
---
As previously mentioned, I didn‚Äôt watch the ViDoc...
---
Cold fusion medals. Nuff said.
---
Gunsmith materials are used to purchase upgrade modules. They were used to infuse weapons before but Bungie reworked that in Shadowkeep. As of now they are mostly worthless but still keep an ample supply of them, like 1000.
---
Keep in mind: Mara has kept what's essentially a god on lockdown. She did significant damage to Oryx's dreadnought. She forced a House of the Fallen to serve her.  She ran a prison of the solar system's worst. She rules the Awoken, who we've all seen are no joke. Even her douchebag brother was a little bit of a badass. Petra? Petra serves her, without question. Considering how much of a badass Petra is, that should tell you everything you need to know. Mara for the win.
---
well yes, but wouldn't that look either weird (two claw feet) or boring (two normal boots)?
---
It's the same. 1 kill is 1 point, 1 medal is 1 point. There are medals that give several 100 points, like cold fusion.
---
Don‚Äôt need wins for any of the bounties, just specific objectives. No need to stress over what the enemies are as long as you focus on what you need for bounties. You also get Valor no matter what.

[Here‚Äôs a video from azetecrosss covering everything ](https://youtu.be/Y0HXtJ2_qQo)
---
I mean truth came out first but okay.
---
This is why we need supremacy iron banner back.
---
I had one of these moments the other day XD dude goes super I shout fuck you and threw a hammer he deflected it I went super and slammed we both died XD
---
Well ya...but harder opponents equals less progress. And bounties aside, getting thrown around by teams is frustrating.
---
Well you know what!? I have zappy hammer!
---
Bruh your writing is suckier.
---
Honestly all the balancing has been for pvp, and since launch they've kept trying to nerf things and the balance keeps getting worse. Even though I haven't done the two most recent raids I can guarantee you I could make it through without any of the pvp pinnacle weapons
---
Ok
---
Good news! It's coming back next week! Get that grind on!
---
The truth, and the light
---
Hes easy to counter. Just find some stairs or play some dubstep.
---
I played it without sound first and though "aw man, it'd be funny to put interstellar music to this".
---
The problem isn't that peeps don't know how to play Control. The problem is that Iron Banner and the associated bounties do not rely on Match Wins for rewards. 
---
Aside from 1 Capture Zones bounty, all other bounties are just Kill Enemies - and if you're on the other side of the map capturing a zone, you're not killing enemies and progressing towards your rewards.
---
I think so! Just didn‚Äôt want to suggest a pinnacle crucible weapon.
---
*Sighs in 70+ clears with no Anarchy*
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
It's not necessarily new players, unfortunately it's used that way more now because of new light, it actually is a reference to players outside of your team being blue dots on your minimap(blue circular thing=blueberry).
---
What's the issue?
---
Dude that was a nasty play. I'm angry just watching that.
---
This.... this is why I don‚Äôt warlock XD those of you who can master the jumps I respect you but I‚Äôm still gonna lick your books.
---
That‚Äôs what I meant I got the recluse thx
---
Ophidian aspect gang for quickdraw + fast reload on all weapons
---
Yea I miss typed I meant 2100 I got the recluse thx
---
No, you can only co-op red war after the ‚ÄòSpark‚Äô mission where you get your light back. He‚Äôs in his own till then.
---
THIS IS THE WAY
---
Awesome! thanks mate
---
Funny way to spell titan
---
So basically all my teammates have smoll pp
---
What sucks?
---
(Not good at detecting sarcasm)
---
I suppose so. I've only heard stories of people who just switched recently so have only played mnk for a bit. And they pretty much still just play console now lol. My bad tho, I dont have first hand experience just get tired of the console players who always say mnk is just worlds easier without realizing the opponent obviously has the same accessibility
---
I gotta get me one of those
---
What you say is true
---
Nice.
---
That‚Äôs Mysterio....
---
I'm not insinuating any of that. I'm saying, I don't understand how people control their jumps and successfully parkour in those classes
---
Thinking that you have it is not like you having it :) check your quests
---
I got huckleberry from the fated engram, i love it and the reload animation is so cool!
---
Where it says lost items it has 6 exotic engrams, does that mean you lost  the exotics?
---
I got that too today.....
---
Could I get the template for this? I've been trying to find it but not having much luck unfortunately.
---
and many days to come young one.
---
Alternate Gateway to the infinite forest
---
You serious? Like half of the dodgy fellows run high jump with a shotgun. Titans are more guilty of mountaintop+recluse
---
No they are not the same. Adventures are optional missions while story missions are not. They are smaller than story missions.
---
Nah idk titanfall was better in my opinion and the archer heavyrocket was bae
---
I have it and this still hurt me. My dad got the sparrow and Anarchy on his first run
---
Maybe stop just holding W and there would be no issue
---
Stompees suck? What?
---
No those are item that the postmaster has right now
---
Your loadout for reaching legend

Oh, that makes more since

The part after it is amazing, you know when uldren....
---
Comp has a shit load of them.
---
Dopamine. Style. Something like that.
---
Yeah, pretty much
---
??
---
Fair enough, that was just my personal experience so take it with a grain of salt, I could just be going against people who aren‚Äôt really that good since matchmaking is mostly connection based. And I feel you on that, a lot of console players have to justify crutching erentil somehow. I‚Äôve heard way too many people say shit like ‚Äúoh console is way harder so theres no way i could actually get good at aiming‚Äù
---
Titans are the scum of the earth
---
While grinding for Malfeasance (was not worth my sanity) I was having a bad GP match and all of my teammates left. It was 1/4 and I had 25 motes in the bank. 
---
Really put a damper on my spirits.
---
Ok, so 12 punch/liars/combo/thunder oil plus a bunch of Dynamo and the one that gives you super for punching stuff. You have your super back in literal seconds and the damage is insane. You can use armor 1.0 pieces to boost Dynamo and the other thing to the max
---
Dunemarchers add an electric effect to all melees including the throwing hammer
---
I saw him too

Oh yeah it‚Äôs all coming together
---
Yesterday a buddy and I were using sweet business and the entire lobby started using it. The lowest kills was 20 I think. It was a good game.
---
Wops sorry I mean thinks for the information to improve my self
---
Shhhhh, let them keep thinking we're eating crayons.
---
I understood that reference.
---
We ride at dawn
---
It drops from exotic engrams, which randomly drop from killing any enemy, but are extremely rare.
---
Quick heads-up: go to the Spyder and buy up like 2000+ Helium Filaments. He's selling 5 for 1 purple legendary shard, and they can be turned into Shadowkeep weapon bounties later on. Stocking up on them will allow you to grind out your god roll weapon later on.  Note you have until tomorrow 9PST/13EST as his wares will change out. If you can't grab them in time, it's not a big deal as you'll just have to wait till he sells them again. 
---
This is how I've managed to grind out some 50 non-god roll Love and Deaths.
---
Dunemarchers + Hammer gives a surprising amount of AoE damage to a team.
---
I‚Äôve run every single raid and haven‚Äôt had this issues, it‚Äôs crazy. I have every set of every raid but garden just isn‚Äôt happening for me lol.
---
I don't see the draw in playing with hacks. Like where is the fun in playing like that?
---
Also ya that‚Äôs exactly what I try to do
---
I‚Äôm still not sure it was hacks, but idk
---
Don't get too cut up about it, you probably killed them a couple of times and they haven't learnt how to lose gracefully. You can safely ignore them.
---
What about Dredgen? I‚Äôm only missing the Ghost shell and I wanna see how I‚Äôll be thought of by the community
---
Ever since shadowkeep hc range nerf's, lumina has been decently strong among hand cannons, especially with the healing orb. Paired with middle tree dawnblade, it is my favorite build. I like to use it with either pheonix, lunafaction, or sanguine.
---
I‚Äôm very aware it only has a specific set of loot, I‚Äôve just never had this issue in any other raid. I wouldn‚Äôt expect the entire set to drop on 1 or 2 runs but literally 8 runs and all I‚Äôve gotten is arm pieces and the shitty bow and 1 hand cannon
---
Thank you
---
It's because it's console if I had to guess. Everything looks much more calm because aiming is typically so much slower on a controller.
---
They‚Äôre pretty good
---
Combine with Monte Carlo for increased fun

They're just *really fuckin fun* with dunemarchers in PVE. Get that Thor action going.

About to start the malfeasance quest and I‚Äôll probably end up banking a single mote every time I get it. I‚Äôve thought about it though and I‚Äôm going to try for at least 3 sets of 10 per game or round. The kills will just come naturally since I really like invading.

If you download The Vault for destiny 2 you can look at your loadouts and change them within the app. Its really useful. There's also one called Where's Due that will tell you where Due is and what he is selling.

Good times man. Still got a gif from beta when I got a double kill off a shoulder charge because I was mindblown and didn't realize it had an AoE lol
---
I made a clip of me getting a collat with a linear fusion because I thought it was super rare (which it was)
---
Difficult, not impossible. Our clan has mute/deaf members and they are still pulling their weight in gold in all the raids. Rather them than many randos who can speak on the lfgs.
---
Mic is not a necessity. Never was, never will be. If outright deaf people can raid perfectly after a wipe or two (which you would get with newbies anyways), they are not any worse than non handicapped folk. Sure on console thats a different topic, but pc, text chat is there. Once they get the rhythm of the encounter they are just as good as any speaking folk. 
---
So downvoting that guy is uttely pointless and moronic. And yes I welcome any downvotes thrown at my way if it happens. If deaf people can do it but you cant while speaking, that says a lot. (This segment wasnt directly to you, dude I responded too, dont take offense)
---
I didn't realize linear had penetration...
---
*Interesting*

Yeah but Petra is way more attractive. Idc about achievements, if I did it fawn over my titan. Petra is best girl.

what the fuck

True, but you still need the balls to get up close and personal; you're an easier target and you have to be faster an your feet - which kinda balances it out a bit for me.
---
&gt;extremely rare situation.

eemmm not really

I wish they did more with titan because right now it's fucking tiny and basically useless

So what do?

oh damn your right

I'm a voidlock main and hate taking him into the crucible, I'm about 2 or 3 times more efficient with my hunter. Also ophidia spate is much better for pvp and ayour mobility, resistance, regen, build is a bit more critical with a warlock in pvp than hunters and titans.
---
You clearly didn't play year one
---
The more enemies you kill, the more points you get. That's where it's spelled out. As someone else said, it's probably not an issue on the 750 Ordeal, but 920 and higher, it matters.

Literally no one has used this build. Tell me the last time you've been killed by a throwing hammer
---
why would that matter?
---
Imagine having a half decent post but then you lose all the karma to your own comments on said post.
---
Had this happen yesterday. Ran a 920 Ordeal, for the most part it went smoothly. Got the to drill site, and one dude just took off on his sparrow. The other dude and I tried to speed through the Shielded Champion down there, but we got pulled into the boss fight before we could. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Finished with a score slightly over 99k. That last champion would've given us the 100k we needed.
---
Classic Bungie
---
Combination blow arc staff with chained invisibility is god tier tho
---
Bungie decided to go full r-tard when they came up with their censored word list.
---
Everyone knows the green ones are the absolute worst, zavala hands those ones out when you toss his salad.....or so I've heard.....never had one üò≥üò≥üò≥

d1 reddit is where you complain and boast about achievements d2 reddit is for destiny artwork and memes
---
My group gave up on it with 5 people. The rest of the group insists on doing raids blind for the first time, so things can get tedious at times. Now we are waiting for the 6th party member to be available before trying again.
---
Huh. Somehow I don't remember Io being alllllll the way down there
---
Back when replaying the campaign was all there was to do before the raid dropped
---
The duke was in D1 dude. You would know that if you played it.
---
Garden City!?!  
---
Fuck your commute!
---
Bruh we need a warlock buff i been a warlock since D1 &amp; am just now switching to a titan
---
doing so much better man it‚Äôs like PVP was designed with only titan &amp; hunter in mind, warlock gets outplayed by even the worst titans/hunters unless you get the jump on them and fire the first opening shots, even still you can get turned on
---
I expected large blocker deployed right as you tried to bank, then maybe get wrecked and lose all your motes
---
Grinding for Randy and redrix. So close, need about 50 more scout kills. Got the jade rabbit catalyst done as well, grinding iron banner for tokens for enhanced mods and valor for resets. Working on bounties, sucks that the ones you can buy repeatedly don‚Äôt count
---
Few of my old clan mates reached out to me. I‚Äôm going to do some today since I haven‚Äôt done any yet. Thank you.
---
Nah I think he‚Äôs right. Are you suggesting for a Black Friday sale they should have made things more expensive? If so, that is really stupid.
---
Yep
---
I never encountered it in D1 and I played that since beta. But I'm sorry, I will remove the post
---
no time to explain was the exotic version of the strangers rifle the model was then reused and altered for the curse of osiris forge gun machina dei 4 and then reused again for the vex offensive gun Adhortative
---
Only one way to become a crucible player 
---
I wasn‚Äôt either i used to hate it &amp; feel like a bot, started playing more and more &amp; now i can consistently go positive which atleast makes it fun. 
---
Plus i got to grind for recluse before it‚Äôs nerfed which is beautiful
---
Loneliness and lack of people to play with.
---
The good ol days, but why does it show a large blocker symbol next to strike playlist
---
No prob the raid is also one the easiest in the game so you should do that too. The loot is amazing for the work you put in. If you haven't already, then I'd get izanagis as well
---
They are using wells, making orbs for each other, and
---
It‚Äôs kinda just common sense really
---
Go on a different character I completed the quest on my hunter but I had to claim it on my warlock
---
Damn this brings back some memories
---
Yup I remember that brings back memories
---
Pokemon!
---
Huh, didn't know that the slug explosion is a kill even with 5 body shots. TIL.
---
what makes them one shot? why can't hunter knife one shot?
---
The duck you just say about warlocks idiot
---
They are using wells, making orbs for each other,
---
Make it 500 shards
---
I wonder what sort of goods Dick 's sporting.
---
Lol why remove it. It was a blue weapon in d1
---
Forsaken
---
I still try to go to the farm and play soccer. Last time anyone joined me was season 6.
---
It was so hard and long for me! Finally finished it last night and got the lumina... I‚Äôve been grinding the wrong quest this whole time...
---
Calus is the family dog after the fighting escalates and all the food gets knocked on the floor
---
the dreadnaught was a really cool place yeah
---
If you dont have crucible pinnacle weapons like recluse I'd recommend you go for those
---
You're right, i didn't get any of these notifications &gt;\_&gt;  
---
Also the guy deleted all his comments so I don't even know what happened.  
---
Plus, probably I've explained myself badly, i bought forsaken but i only did the main campaign. Just the red war (i guess it's called like that, i mean the basic story)
---
Black Friday *deal*
---
Basically, what OP‚Äôs saying is that they should sell an extra expensive Engram that can give you items that would otherwise require a long grind. An example of this loot could be the Xenophage, or Izanagi‚Äôs burden.
---
At least, that‚Äôs what I think OP‚Äôs trying to say
---
[This](https://youtu.be/KW9fIKW6v4c) is how I will always remember d1y1.

You should try Nvidia's Geforce Now beta, similar to Stadia but you can use games you already own. You'll have to sign up for the beta but there's no telling how long you'd have to wait for an invite code
---
Wait, unless you use DIM or similar isn't this still a problem in D2?
---
Yup.
---
[deleted]
---
Wormgods is also what's doing 99% of the heavy lifting here. It's a 3x multiplier at 5 stacks. And Roaring flames is currently a 30% increase at 3 stacks. But will be 75% after the buff. 
---
This guy is just the only madman who has the confidence to get a hammer kill every 5 seconds.
---
Cleanest kill I've seen in a while
---
I mean, that got patched up with an emblem.
---
But the memories...

Yep, with proximity grenade

Still doesn't affect my point of the fact that synergy is obvious. A bunch of things increasing melee damage, melee for super and ways to chain melee. Doesn't take a genius to figure out it's a great combo.

that's what I mean. I've been raging at how accurate everybody but me is with the damn thing and now I know why.
---
This video was funny at first, but this is even better
---
Yeah, destiny 1 had ammo packs that you could buy, so when you went into any tough encounter, you could bring the hurt.
---
 I think over by the gunsmith in the original tower.
---
Good times, brings back dat nostalgia.
---
Now we have raid banners that fully charge your super as well as top off your ammo, which we definitely didn't have in D1.
---
But you can't pop that wherever.
---
matchmaking could be so fun in this game, but right now it's like they just throw anyone together. Grinding Glory is the least fun I've had in a PvP game to date. Every single game was either 4-0 or 0-4. They may as well just let you flip a coin instead of making you suffer through unwinnable games, or boring ones against people no where near your skill.
---
Competitive NEEDS a forfeit. Can't leave, but you can't forfeit so you just have to get hammered on round after round. Total frustrating waste of time.
---
I did while typing my last messageü§£
---
Bank 30 motes total within a certain time period of your first dunk
---
Ahh yes, this was amazing
---
I remember when Earth was the only Planet...
---
that‚Äôs facts
---
Thanks, Are their any other good scout rifles?
---
What about mmxix ü§î
---
When you're running low on karma
---
I can also confirm I have been having better luck with exotics in Shadowkeep.  Seems they implemented something to give less chance of giving you duplicates.  I rarely or never see them anymore.
---
Oof
---
True
---
But to remember it?
---
Tales were told of the engrams that once dropped from that cave.
---
You too
---
damn there only used to be 4 playable areas aside from the tower and the leviathan ?? i forgot about how poorly this game launched compared to what it has become
---
This is so heart warming. Ghost, play "Royal Pools" OST.
---
They rotate daily.
---
woo, that his hits different
---
I mean all of their f2p games multiplayer are free, why not also make it free for Destiny 2; a f2p games
---
It's very easy to catch up and we have a lot of new players so it's not hard to find groups for anything. Just join the PC lfg discord if u play on PC. Also look for sherpa runs so it won't be problem that u still learning.
---
THROW! MORE! BREAD! GUARDIAN!

---
Lol yeah I saw it on Mercury. It works if you go into the shadows too.  Also shaders change it to look like a real cat. Like the Inside of the ears stay pink but you can make it an orange cat

this is all that I could think of off the top of my head, its really not a whole lot compared to what we have now in d2 but it would still be nice to get some of these things. hope this helped you!
---
Who else chugged Red Bulls for the XP codes?

Yes, that‚Äôs actually a good idea...they should add OST to ghosts like a music player üò≥

---
Spoiler bro
---
I meant the part of the quest that says pick up an exotic engram
---
Man, I'm ready for Momentum next reset and melting OEM Striker Titans with a single Main Ingredient burst!
---
Figure maybe so but it's like crazy numbers for me lol
---
Ok, movement. Try moving your way out of an OEM titan who can see you through everything JUST FOR GETTING SHOT.
---
Invis is negligible, useful only for people who rely on radar.
---
Supers? Really? Name one thing that a Hunter super can do in PvP that another class can't do better.
---
Dodge? You mean when they animation lock you and move you slightly to the right?
---
And I'm assuming by wall hacks you mean Flawless Execution, which got nerfed into the ground a while ago. This one has an entirely too specific activation method, with little payoff. The wallhacks last three seconds and we don't get the just for getting shot. Tha ks for coming to my TED talk.
---
Also, the knife has a wind-up animation. Eat shit, nerds.
---
anyone got a picture of destiny 1 year 1 navigator?
---
It was my favourite patrol zone with the exception of maybe dreadnaught and sivafied cosmodrome
---
We rejoined and it took us to the start
---
I used it for a while. Sadly, it requires you to be melee'd before activation, or you need to melee someone else, which will end badly for you.
---
You get like 120 Glory points on reset if you played 3 Ranked matches during the week. If you are missing less than 120, have played 3 matches and you may not feel confident about winning then just wait it out.
---
it hasnt really been that long since then but it feels like it has been huh. best part of that game i think was the soundtrack tho.
---
Oof I never completed it
---
I hope you will enjoy your time and keep grinding, Guardian. You'll get those huge numbers someday.
---
You our only 30 hours into d1? Are you thinking about putting the same amount of time into d2?
---
Then why the fuck would you comment on it
---
That‚Äôs probably because a lot of the people who worked on vanilla d1 left, including Marty :(.
---
I use kindled orchid and play ps4 too, sadly I don‚Äôt have a godroll but I think if you have one with explosive payload, rampage and Killclip it can 3 tap at pretty good ranges. Im not sure if all this is correct but its something like it
---
I used iron banner to rack up the medals and momentum control to get through kills.
---
Blueberries are people you match up with who aren‚Äôt naturally in your fire team for example if you and a few friends log into crucible you will see that their names are green as are the dots on your minimal, but the random that fills in the space is blue named and has a blue dot hence blueberry
---
A pic as old as time itself
---
My build is fully mobility and regen, with 50 for the former and 80 for the latter. What is ophidia spate and why is it better than the reload sprint and faster sprint
---
Max gear is 960. You can get this without the dlc it will just take a lot longer.

I still love my god roll Austringer even though 150s are more dominant right now. Thorn and Spare Rations are my favorite 150s. Malfeasance actually kind of shreds now surprisingly. That slug explosion melts supers if you have enough time to get the shots out
---
Thanks, stranger
---
You know I‚Äôve been playing destiny since beta (D1) and recently it have been kinda boring lately. Bungie kinda killed the game. The removed all the pvp stuff and it‚Äôs getting kinda repetitive.
---
I'm a year 1 veteran but I don't remember this. Possibly because whenever I played Destiny 2 back then I was more than a little tipsy.
---
The hunter chooses the pokemon he thinks looks the cutest, doesnt care about stats.
---
Warlock chooses the one everyone says is the best to start with.
---
Titan ignores professor oak and starts pummeling young pidgy an rattata with his fists of havoc
---
The Empty Tank lost sector in tangled shore gets me every time!
---
This sounds crazy but the right roll on the Duke can be godly in Crucible. Even with Rampage x 1 you can two tap with the Duke on a Guardian with 5 or less resilience.
---
Or you can pull an Esoterickk and tether them all. I assume you meant Nessus as well.
---
I especially liked that "all of this is playable space" https://youtu.be/BTfhrONAp-c 2:20
---
Not far from you üç∫
---
Also Peregrine Greaves.
---
I was just getting out of middle school now I‚Äôm in college and still in love with this game
---
And they all die from an exploding thrall..
---
The rumors about the story being absolutely hacked up by Activision at the midnight hour, making it an almost incoherent mess was apparent, but players who trusted in Bungie and enjoyed their gameplay and world building could see the underpinnings.
---
Sad it took nearly five years to get the game where I think Bungie envisioned all along.
---
I hopped on the Warlock train in D2 so I never got to experience the self revive or the insane melee kills from D1 üòÇ
---
üçª
---
Probably like 4 hours lol
---
Very nice. I felt that melee kill.
---
I've heard that excuse before but there just isn't a skill gap for pve like there is in PvP so it is really just one way
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm not gonna say that she isn‚Äôt at all libertarian, but drifter seems like he has it ingrained in him
---
I‚Äôm at 2300 hours
---
Where do you go to see this ?
---
Damn nice
---
Honestly a waste of discipline...kinda defeats the purpose of an exotic lol. You could make your build much better investing in other stats but do you boo boo.
---
Google time wasted on destiny
---
Best thing I‚Äôve seen this week
---
Lol, seriously?
---
Yup lol
---
Time played on Xbox: 2020+ hours
---
Every time there‚Äôs this like 4-5 second delay in the round causing death or misfire 
---
Really infuriating
---
Maybe it‚Äôs not garbage?
---
Damn that's like top 3%
---
I did the same except just came back with the shadowkeep expansion.. I'm overwhelmed with content
---
Cool thanks
---
Yes and no. The discipline means a 30s Nade, but the exotic means a 15 second or faster nade
---
It was a joke, look at the spelling
---
Doesn't count title screen or tower time
---
Skyburner's oath as well
---
Worth every penny
---
Just passing by the front page. Haven't played d2 since around launch. Leviathan will always be huge in my memory :)
---
No you just wanted a piece of the karma.
---
But sticking a fusion grenade can't OHK like in D1, because that would be OP, right
---
Isn't that Age-Old Bond? I love that gun
---
I remember that orbit opera music...was a nive song in the beginning.now it drives me insane.
---
Because what else was there to do, lol.
---
I dunno how it tracks hours but the Xbox app shows 2020+ while that site you mentioned shows just under 980.
---
is it nsfw because it‚Äôll give me epilepsy?
---
Do they have highest jump mobility? I always feel like I can go way further on my Warlock imo 
---
And the health regen on class ability thing can be debated since it requires an exotic, while warlocks get health regen *a n d* an over shield with no exotic
---
Only people from 1959 remember pictures taken of their screens
---
who do you think you are Mr constructive criticism
---
Exactly. Good ARs exist!
---
Fuck you, take my upvote.
---
I understand...but with 100 discipline your other stats are booty. A 15 second nade doesn‚Äôt mean anything dead.
---
Hell yeah it is!
---
It's been one of my go-to weapons for a long time. Basically a full auto scout rifle.
---
That specific shield goblin never puts up his shield in that strike. It's weird tbh.
---
Nevertheless, we Titans appreciate you
---
What smg?
---
monte carlo its a monster in the crucible
---
Yeah re-reading it I can see the sarcasm.. My brain is broken
---
Is that so? Did you hear about the solar needs to warlocks? And did you notice that almost all of the armor pieces for Warlocks look dull, and uninspired? No? 
---
For instance, the Phenotype Plasticity set. The Titans get an arm blade, and the Hunters get a VEX FOOT! That shit looks so cool!
---
Warlocks...look...Vex-y. And get a shoulder dildo I guess. Cool.
---
That‚Äôs one of many examples. I really don‚Äôt want to put up with your victim bullshit when Hunters are the most played class in Destiny 2. Of course Bungie‚Äôs going to suck you guys‚Äô dicks to avoid losing player count. And I already KNOW I‚Äôm going to be downvoted by salt. I‚Äôm not even going to respond though, so have fun.
---
Yes!!!
---
Right! I had all the forsaken exotics within a month! This season on the other hand, I dont even have a new exotic yet lol
---
With the firing of lead writers and its chief composer as well...
---
Is the destiny of mankind controlled by some transcendental entity?

I play crucible and within a day I got about 300 tokens

Hunters are still pvp dominant even with one eyed mask. Always have been since D1
---
I would pay good money to have Donald Duck to do commentary in crucible with Shaxx.
---
That‚Äôs good to hear!
---
Lol it's cool man dont worry,
---
Fuckin bitch, what if he had a perfect life to work on? Oh yea you were early on buying the dlc cuz you sit ur lonely ass being the reddit memer without a life
---
I think that should change a little not much, I don't want a full on nerf
---
Most are in their 20s now but still have the same gamertag and maturity level from when they were 15. Usually overly excited about anything that involves 420 or 69
---
You can always do Niobe labs to get a static god roll.

I can feel this but raise you dunemarchers, and doomfangs

how do you do it im trying to randys and mountaintop already got recluse

i mean Drifter is not joking when he says "talk to your team"

Ah yes OEM bad Hunters good
---
You‚Äôre as beautiful as the day I lost you
---
Oh great, the only very good neutral game in the whole warlock class, its not like titans and hunters have decent neutral game with almost every tree and branch... Oh wait, they do.
---
Have i mentioned that the good neutral game of warlocks is entirely grenade dependant, and if you dont have it, you cant do shit with the rest of the neutral?
---
Its great to have a single build possibility to match other classes neutral games and op stuff...

What excuse will Hunters and Warlocks have after they get smashed next season?
---
This ^
---
I mean if your new you might think hunters and titans have good neutral on nearly every class, but in reality the top tier subclasses are dawnblade, nova warp, bottom striker, and spectral hunter, maybe bottom arcstrider and bubble titan. Gl in whatever meta your in bc I wish I could be there lmao.
---
Can someone explain?
---
Iron banner doesnt give glory for getting pinnacle weapons. Orewings is RNG. Itll either drop at rank up, from engram, or when turning in tokens.
---
.... It's a raid weapon, of course it's not garbage

There is lore about shaxx fucking Mara sov while he kept his helmet on

It‚Äôs not 
---
But other classes just seem blatantly ignored when looking at raw Titan strength

Give me some time to go make a couple hundred reddit accounts to upvote this more

Lol
---
I play all classes so I dont care. Just see a lot of crying and whining from non Titan players while Hunters and Warlocks have their own OP items/supers.
---
I miss when the tower was in the middle so I didn‚Äôt klick on earth every fucking time

80 is just being nice.
---
i was momentary happy to learn there was a beef planet on destiny 1 and then i opened the post.
---
*DIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIING*
---
Just throw moar grenades!
---
It would be easier looking up a video.
---
I actually got hate mail the other night cuz I watched that video and spent a solid 7-8 games kicking shit in the face almost exclusively.
---
Pair it with Liar‚Äôs Handshake/One-Two Punch Shotty &amp; Thunder coil. üëåüèª
---
Wow just wow! He would not be happy. Unless that little duck can punch you in the throat!
---
Especially on a well with a tether and hammer titan debuff.
---
Hence the ‚Äúfail‚Äù part bud.
---
Just dont delete the titan. You can have 3 characters.
---
Yeah but light level doesn't make a difference in IB does it?
---
No need to delete your Titan what alot of people do is have one of each character.
---
^^^^^^
---
Nah, I tought the guy was hacking when using this helm because it looks like you have infinite melee energy. Today I got mine and punched 25\~30 people in my third pvp run using it
---
Me too, I started just when the April update happened
---
Why delete the Titan at all?
---
F
---
Anyone else seeing the 2 faces on each side?
---
Are those tied to the expansion?  Bc the standard ones are awful and the blink for arc strike causes it to run down really fast
---
You could just not delete your titan. You have three character slots, use them.
---
But no. Weapons, collections and triumphs will carry over, quests will not.
---
You can do it!!!!
---
Why delete the titan? You can have 3 characters. I have one of each class
---
Mhm, to be honest I rarely use exotic armor anymore but I do enjoy synthoceps and Peregrine Greaves. Fun exotics that tend to be forgotten.
---
Hunter/Warlock: ‚ÄúHa! Foolish Titan, you have the reach of a T-Rex!‚Äù
---
Me with Synthoceps: *Teleports behind you* ‚ÄúGuess again.‚Äù
---
Don't make me lose nnn on day 30 plz
---
We‚Äôre rats. We‚Äôre rats. We‚Äôre the rats. 
---
We prey at night, we stalk at night, we‚Äôre the rats.
---
Baron armor chest piece from tangled shore heroic adventures is noice.
---
This one got past us so we'll let it slide, but please keep posts specific to destiny 2 in the future.
---
Thanks!
---
Yeah. They look like trapped souls.
---
&gt; Big Shaxx
---
Now I want a voice line of "Man's Not Hot" lyrics
---
I mean, this is what we're really like, but I just mosey along

---
That is partially incorrect. The only things that won‚Äôt transfer over are quests/ bounties and your inventory. (not consumables)
---
You can also transfer items via the vault or the various apps
---
We must create the destiny purity strike team. Plenty of r34 out there, but it‚Äôs nothing A few surgical strikes won‚Äôt fix.
---
It does.

---
Step one: stop existing
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm over 2 years late and didn‚Äôt bother searching before I yelled into the void about my rare drop‚Äù
---
Lol what? You can see the light level while it‚Äôs in your inventory/post master. If anything you would need to have it all equipped when you pick it up off the ground/go to orbit and send it to you post master.. if you were being overly cautious.
---
And keep grinding Randy‚Äôs Throwing Knife‚Äôs quest.
---
And that‚Äôs why i dont play PvP. I thought this was a first person *shooter*
---
Yeah man I appreciate the insight honestly you're way more level headed than a lot of people I've come across in youtube comments or friends that have switched lol. People always wanna throw jabs at PC being easier or what not but nah man I'm sure being 5500 on both systems you're playing pretty tough people dont sell yourself short on my behalf lol.
---
I just read it with his voice, damn it‚Äôs the same effect as a Morgan Freeman picture
---
Essentially
---
Thank god I didn't buy the game till forsaken
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm calling it‚Äù
---
I feel bad for the REAL titans like you that automatically are assumed to be a stinky poo poo-head.
---
Nope. They game recognizes all equip-able gear for calculating your current max PL, no matter where the gear is located. It can be in the vault or on another character, not even on you let alone equipped on you.
---
**ESPECIALLY** Peregrine Greaves! lol
---
:(
---
Keep it together, guardian! You can do it!
---
Jade Rabbit, she‚Äôs been my baby since Taken King
---
nice
---
i 100% guaran-fucking-tee that hunter and warlock mains will continue and infinitely complain about OEM until it's banned from pvp. it's main perk, Vengeance, is the main problem of it, not the slow health regeneration.
---
sick beat though.
---
I miss the D1 knight design. It looks so awesome.
