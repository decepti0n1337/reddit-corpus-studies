Nice! Almost there. Used like all of my mats and currency but it was worth it! Lol
---
How can we be sure the light-monger's dead? Keep shooting solider.
---
To bad there was a death in there... Nah looking at your stats your a rather skilled player, especially skilled use of supers it seems. Kudos mate
---
Wut?
---
Windows of Oppurtunity is by far one of my favorite episodes of the series.
---
What does it do?
---
My legendary shards have been feeling it man
---
Well yes, they did change the entire weapon system, but for better gameplay. Changing the slot of a weapon seems like an extremely drastic change
---
Nigga what?
---
Extends the duration of the string of curses perk
---
GOOD WORK, GUARDIAN! YOUR LIGHT IS STRONG!
---
almost like this is a massive game with hundreds of interlocking parts
---
Your first comment in 7 months is straight salt
---
Isn't that hot?
---

---
Extremely.
---
I just posted this on my clans discord, thanks for the info.
---
I wouldn't know, but it's supposed to be a monster in PvE, too.
---
They've announced that when shadowkeep releases, all Y1 becomes free to play for anyone.
---
Ahh yes I was thinking of doing this too but my money...
---
Haven't shards been garbage for months now after the nerf?
---
He's got the Scarab Gun!

Loadout?
---
I spent all 1000 of my legendary shards :(
---
We'll get it when we go to the moon. Remember all the ugly AF, but incredible gear we had from the Dreadnaught? I had some AR that looked like a hive phallus that was like 1200 RPM. It was dumb.
---
Can you explain this just a little further? Like you save your oracle offering and put it in a minute before it resets into full curse?
---
Depends on the tribute. They all cost glimmer and some other currency. There are some for legendary shards, some for bright dust, and some for planetary materials
---
We speak like this because this language is primitive to us. Us Titans have ascended the need for primitive speech and communicate through telepathic war cries.
---
Maybe? I think that would be 2, but I am not positive. When you hover over the chalice in the pursuits inventory, it will say "powerful rewards remaining: (number)" so that is how you would be able to find out.
---
Dude all Willis does is click bait and if it‚Äôs not click bait it‚Äôs a super long video on something A baby would think to do

Okay thanks, better start saving up then
---
He probably creamed himself as he shot your corpse
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a bug, Bungie tweeted that they‚Äôre looking into it
---
Hmmmm.....no
---
Bungie, much like google and lots of other posts in this sub are aware of the issue.
---
There is not. The only way to currently acquire Destiny 2 would be to buy the Forsaken DLC (the "legendary collection" and the "complete collection" are the two options, with the complete collection having more stuff in it, and *sometimes* costing less). 
---
You could try to find an old box copy of the base game at a brick and mortar store or other third party seller, but this is not very likely. 
---
I would recommend waiting until September when you can play the first part of the game for free.
---
It‚Äôs such a good time
---
It‚Äôs a known issue
---
I should have looked through the subreddit before posting, but, thanks for pointing that out regardless.
---
Flair doesn‚Äôt check out
---
When you‚Äôre in the ocean and something touches your foot.
---
‚ÄúKnow your place, Trash!‚Äù
---
That depends. Do you want Forsaken? This is a DLC that first released in September 2018, so there's lots of reviews on what it is like. 
---
Do you want Shadowkeep? This is an upcoming DLC, so we don't know much about it. 
---
You should buy the one that you want to play.

I get where you‚Äôre coming from. my read, though, is that because Cayde is dead and never had any association with Cabal Loyalists, Calus feels he‚Äôs beneath notice. if Cayde had been brave enough and worthy enough he would‚Äôve survived, and perhaps made an excellent Exo Shadow, but he didn‚Äôt, so he wasn‚Äôt, so he‚Äôs not worth thinking about. your mileage may vary on this, of course!
---
This quest was added less than a month ago, it's not old. 
---
Corsair Down quests are random drops from killing scorn in the Dreaming City. When you hover over them in the pursuits inventory, it will say you hear an SOS beacon from an area somewhere in the Dreaming City. You must search those areas for the corsair.
---
Whisper Ornament? ü§î
---
That was awesome
---
Hamon or stands?
---
Stands.
---
BAIBEE STANDO
---
Or Izanagi
---
yes, i have already gotten it.
---
I use Little Light. Has option for loadouts.
---
The hunter whose blade barrage I deflected with Antaeus Wards: ‚Äúbut no one can deflect the emerald splash?!‚Äù
---
If it's a new copy for 20 that comes with Forsaken then you're only missing the pass which is 15. The complete collection is 40 with base game, first 2 dlc, forsaken deluxe which comes with a shell, emblem, ornament, and the pass. Xbox is still offering Cayde's Exotic Stash with the 40 one. It's up to you.
---
At least it‚Äôs not like this anymore https://youtu.be/jv8bfc5lxrw
---
There‚Äôs always the Crucible but The Menagerie is the flavor of the season.
---
It‚Äôs an exotic, you can only use it with heavy ammo, and it prevents you running TLW and Ace (which are fantastic on PC) it‚Äôs fine how it is, these players were clustered up and got destroyed
---
You‚Äôre the one actually doing God‚Äôs work.
---
because Cayde haunted the moon, we will meet him there.
---
Every 3 weeks. It‚Äôs only there fitting max curse week. So next week.
---
Oh damn... what if I have accidentally dismantled the Corsair down that I had? :/
---
Ok thank you
---
Next week you can go into it.
---
As a hunter, I feel for your class
---
This works up to 45 for the catalyst too fyi
---
AND RISE UP WHILE YOU‚ÄôRE AT IT
---
How does one acquire the title next to your username?
---
Also people who cheese are usually PvE players wanting to get over the pinnacles quick
---
There‚Äôs a hidden triumph, maybeeeee
---
*finishes*
---
"More"
---
Bungie: " but was just have you bad juju hot fixe-"
---
"MOAR!"
---
Calus would not care for cayde because that would mean another life to get in the way between him and his desire to be the last living thing.
---
I accidentally spent all my glimmer on phaseglass needles
---
He can do just enough impressions to avoid being himself
---
UPDATE: I ran the NF again (same exact one with same exact load out) and the triumph finally triggered. Not sure what happened there. 
---
FYI - To be safe, I ran Menagerie weapons and armor in every slot. 
---
Good luck, Guardians üëç
---
Calus demands you fight worthier foes
---
If you can time it just right with 2 nighthawks  during solar week you should be able to delete Nokris. My friend and I have almost done it during the nightfall, we couldve done it but we used arc singe
---
I was just thinking about how they brought back Sleeper Simulant and it‚Äôs basically just a Beefy Fusion‚Ñ¢, why not make Gjally basically a Beefy Rocket‚Ñ¢ to match lol
---
a tribute to those who stand in his way
---
well calus did forsee a cayde-7...
---
Therea also an Ace Of Spades plaque on the ground in front of Zavala
---
and i will whisper back "youre the dumbass who brought his ghost out"
---
If you‚Äôre on pc you can add me and I can help you, it‚Äôs definitely worth getting into
---
Yep. Luckily I have ton of tokens that I never turn in so i was able to replenish legendary shards quickly.
---
F
---
Not much just new stuff
---
Probably cause he never saw Cayde as a threat
---
His blade barrage was on point in the forsaken cutscene tho. idk why calus isn‚Äôt scared
---
I just kept going. If you open the door you can't do the glitch
---
"Guardian, how the hell was I supposed to know they had a Devourer Bullet? Scorn guns can't kill a Ghost, I thought she'd be safe!"
---
i wouldnt count it as us failing to save cayde since it wasnt really assumed barons would have any sorrow ammo, but also we weren't there at all.
---
If the barons were restraining us while they shot him then his death would our failure. But as it stands it was just cayde confidently getting in too deep one too many times
---
Ty! Unfortunately I'm on Xbox One. Should've included that.
---
You must progress the Nascent Dawn quest step to I think 2 or 3.
---
Yo what helmet is that because I might need that.
---
Take my goddamn upvote.
---
Yes, but at the same time it was our failure because we were too slow to reach him in time. If we had gotten there faster, we would've been able to save him and everything would've been fine.
---
All good, mate.
---
i assume you mean the sparrow horn
---
I spent like 1500 shards today.....
---
Reporting them is probably the best you can do for now.
---
Thats the idea üëå
---
Console, or PC?
---
They did what now? I'm not familiar with this term.
---
The curse is on hold
---
Is there any foe worthier than an r/cursedcomments post?
---
Did you get loot from the encounters as normal? Are you holding the maximum number of keys?
---
Bungie gonna come knocking on ur door
---
Enjoy your new journey, Guardian.
---
"Set boomers to obliterate"
---
This is the wrong place to ask bungie, go post on forums or report a complaint
---
Make an appeal?
---
Nice!
---
You were most likely mass reported for severe bad connection. I report people I come across with bad connections all the time.
---
Its because your Guardian decided to fight purely with his light lol
---
He has tons of lego posts in his history, so it‚Äôs pretty clear he‚Äôs real
---
Horde physically everything
---
I put one there and someone told me the replies from support are trash there and told me to post here.
---
Haven't been able to find a link or a place to appeal the ban.
---
What do you mean gameplay wise? Nothing has changed in that department
---
Tripled jirc
---
Let's not forget Jot√ºn
---
Usually when bungie bans, they don‚Äôt unban. You can try but it‚Äôs rare for them to respond and even rarer to be unbanned. Chances are they won‚Äôt see a post here amongst all the shitposts. Try and PM the mods or dmg and maybe they can help. Good luck.
---
Damn, lucky. Idk how the hell some people play enough to have 10k shards, max stack planetary stuff, etc. I had like 3k a couple weeks ago and somehow they burned down to 300 in like a month
---
Its not cheating.  I'm right you're wrong. Deal with it. Who hurt you so badly that you treat a game like its reality? Relax dude. Chill out.
---
Yes but I can't help that people have been wanting dedicated servers for a long time now.
---
Get up Guardian we have a lego area to build...
---
Oh god oh fuck
---
oh
---
lol very true, sadly I didn't even think about it so I hadn't been buying materials
---
That's the risk you take. When you knowingly play with an awful connection, you're eventually going to get banned.
---
Bungie isn't going to reverse a ban that was issued for poor connection status.
---
And no one from Bungie visits this sub, so posting here won't accomplish anything.
---
I'll try that and HOPE i get unbanned
---
Who hurt you so badly that you can't get anything unless it's easy or spoon fed to you, I am the one who is right here it's not even a debate I am outright teaching you at how wrong you are you will always be wrong and I will always be right there is not a single scenario in all of existence where you are right deal with it if you can't think of anymore excuses to than block me otherwise I will keep telling you that you are wrong and always will be.
---
Welp, time to watch all of Peter Capaldi's run as the doctor again to find this episode
---
There is no one running the thing , the Blind well is bugged for everyone (well that i have seen within the hours since reset update).
---
If I have to go to those lengths.... lol... I'll post something tomorrow when I go back to the Library where it's currently on display.
---
What about other exotics
---
I wasn‚Äôt aware that LoW has been addressed, my bad. And I‚Äôll be honest, idk how to fix shotguns. But I do know that just because shotguns get nerfed doesn‚Äôt mean that fusions can‚Äôt be either. Bungie doesn‚Äôt need to fix things in isolation. And as for the two primaries thing who gives a crap if it‚Äôs two primaries an smg with its short range complements the medium to long range of a pulse rifle. I don‚Äôt see how that‚Äôs a problem. As far as I know, the problem in y1 was perks like high caliber rounds that were most impactful in primaries but that‚Äôs since changed. Then again I didn‚Äôt play all that much in y1 so I might be wrong about that As for team shotting I think that it will always be a bit of a problem. Sometimes more than others, sure, but the nature of d2‚Äôs maps makes team shotting viable. Either way, I don‚Äôt think that the solution should be weapons that do overwhelming damage like shotguns. I don‚Äôt know what the solution should be but that‚Äôs not it.

Here's a shot from my Flickr page. Photo taken in April. I can assure everyone that this is my build

Wow, that is cool. Wonder how to get it working for Nova Bomb now that Skull has been nerfed.
---
Exotics have niche uses but there's not one that really stands out for general use
---
Username checks out
---
Sometimes when you kill enemies with melee attacks or swords they do their precision death animation, so maybe it means that?
---
Feels a little like bungie making us dump resources so we wont have such large stockpiles in September.
---
You need to contact the Bungie Support.
---
Get someone with lumina on you.
---
The tribute hall is permanent but I think the title is limited time.
---
There are in D2 actually, if you go around finding the Ghost Stories, you can find a pretty cool story about how Cayde was rezzed and then fell off a cliff, the story shows quite a bit of personality in the story telling.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMBWiP2p4MA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMBWiP2p4MA) , I don't have the exact number but I recommend finding them all!
---
I agree.
---
Alright I know we're joking but a setup of Cayde "haunting us" and then just pulling that line would be 100% fine with me
---
Wait for the "Still not yours !" posts xD
---
Which show did you miss? It's currently on display in Blacktown Library until this Saturday afternoon.
---
Yes you need all Armor and a weapon from what I have read so far.
---
Nah ya didn‚Äôt ya asshole
---
Oh just that too many people are trash, and project their own failings onto others.
---
I think Some Triumphs are bugged. T took me like 20 kills To the 3% To make my crucible menagerie gear/weapon kills To 100%. Some matches kills just didnt count at al.
---
I was waiting for a hunter to pop in front of the screen, doing the dab! :D
---
Alot of warlock armor is torn tho
---
Lol..I changed my load out when I saw the 5 stack in the rooster.
---
Thank you for this post . So basically exotic armor slot is freed up if you run juju. It would be a waste to run both .
---
Are you saying every slot needs to be armor?
---
Yeah that is kinda confusing, I meant it as not many torn pieces can actually pull it off
---
This is great.
---
To be honest, the activity is way too easy. I ran it solo the first time and got the Triumph first try.
---
Take all of this with a grain of salt though. A lot of the lore around calus might be a lie. We also might be brainwashed too
---
And here I am excited that I got 2 headshot kills on an afk player for my revoker quest...
---
That is incredible work!!!  Well done!!!
---
I just spent all my materials to get bad juju. Now I‚Äôm just gonna chill on the tributes. They can wait
---
I had something similar at Shuro Chi during a Last Wish flawless attempt. Tethered, threw a grenade and then got hit with a taken 1k shot lmao
---
FULL set of armor. Try that.
---
i did that 3 days ago. (thx paul tassi for your article about ssd). But i used the easier way: external SSD:) Instalation time about 20min and no hardware touching. I also might say only one thing: It is a Night and Day difference. Menu loading  and inventory loading are both just as it should be from the beginning. Ive got the same WOW feeling when i did change mamy 46 kod lcd to 65 nich new one
---
The text does say 4 per week, but wasn't clear if it was account wide. After completing with the first char, the other two chars only got glimmer, so I'm betting it is account-wide and will take 20'ish days to get max discount
---
"I can't get on D2 for a few more days"
---
Awesome build
---
So I just press cancel and get out of that page ?
---
i‚Äôll edit for you
---
EDIT 4: 245 now...
---
Legend.
---
Shh I'll hopefully be Shadow this weekend + MMXIX is a given honestly.
---
But fuck Unbroken LMAO
---
You and a few hundred other folks that post the exact same thing. Use youtube. Do the campaign.
---
Also, you will be able to access D2 year 1 content on any platform (the free New Light release in sept) which includes pvp and pve, but you will only be able to access DLC content on the platform in which you bought it. so if you want to play forsaken stuff in 2 consoles, you gotta buy that content twice.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Its not ideal, but way better than nothing at all
---
Mountaintop was pretty carefree..../s
---
Yes, but do you not feel that you are missing out on some of the fun in the game or are you more so into roleplay.
---
how would you cheese recluse? same as mountaintop cheese?
---
See, this right here is very anti-competitive. In every other purely competitive online games, the ones that draw millions of dollars in e-sports, league of legends, dota, starcraft, etc, there is no such this as 'he's better so there's no counterpaly'. The whole idea is that there should always be counterplay if you are smart/careful enough.
---
I understand that this isn't a thing here in destiny, and I understand that many players like it this way, just like they like the ridiculously low TTK currently on, but it still makes me sad, because it reduces the game's competitiveness and makes the entire thing just feel.... cheap...
---
Identity theft is not a joke, Jim!
---
Repost down vote
---
Yeah, same for me. It is early, so maybe just give it a few days.
---
Man I already passed this part on my hunter. Fuck me for doing this the regular way! Well done. I already opened the door but I may try on a second character. 
---
Can you abandon the quest and get it back or anything? Will it work that way?
---
I wanted to buy it today to get the Bungie day emblem so that's why I'm aksing
---
Sounds like it‚Äôs not specific to crucible: https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/cbegjv/destiny_2_is_currently_the_most_fun_buggy_mess_it/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
I literally made this an hour ago.
---
And erentil
---
They said the T-shirt will be accessible today, so wait few hours :)
---
True enough, there isn't. Which is sad. Even sadder that many players, yourself included, seem to be perfectly fine with this. In high-level e-sports games, the ones that draw millions of dollars, like lol, dota, cs:go, starcraft, many profesional competitive fighting games, this is never a thing. There is always counterplay no matter what happens, becase that incetivizes strategy against pure trigger finger skill. This is what makes them interesting to play and to watch, and not just a game of who is the faster fingers.
---
Which is sad, because D2 would have been a great e-sports game. As it stands, even Overwatch has a healthier competitive scene, simply because it always presents strategic counterplay, and its longer ttk encourages tactics against pure finger skill.
---
Ty
---
It‚Äôs probably a spoiler
---
That's such an awesome build! Wish I had the time to get back into Lego, so many cool things I would want to build.
---
Of course, I wanted Forsaken so I bought the pack anyways. But thats not my point. What im trying to address is how having a DLC (one that arguably rivals the Taken King from D1) only available through one method (which requires to you to purchase the entirety of the game again) is terrible.
---
I‚Äôm not exactly saying that I express a deep hatred for it, but that it‚Äôs an objectively bad act, and should be addressed.
---
Because one eyed mask bottom tree striker titans make it unfun.
---
You would not have saved 20 days. To know how much time you saved you would have to multiply the time saved per log in to you account by the amount of times you logged in. 
---
Your math assumes that with an SSD you would have done everything 52% faster. Would you clear a raid 52% faster cause your using an SSD?
---
Man I love Destiny community
---
But imagine if Lord Shaxx taught a yoga class and was always yelling like he is in the crucible, encouraging everyone.

Technically, in the King's Fall raid in D1, Oryx essentially tried to take us during his fight
---
Interesting
---
Through the bright dust section in Eververse.
---
I have just run 4 nightfalls with Menagerie/Crown of Sorrow Gear and broke 100k points every time, no tribute. u/A_dmg04
---
Makes sense man. Appreciate the response.  I like titan too. Although i think I want to try warlock next. Their purple super with the purple ball nuke seems cool. I like the burst potential.
---
You can only get what it shows in the engram pool,m.
---
Alright guys first were gonna do some basic stretches. That's it... Carl, Lift those legs higher buddy. Gooooood.
---
Of course there's a counter play: be faster.  Beat him to the punch and get the first shot in instead of him, simple as that.
---
If you can't do that, you are literally complaining that someone shouldn't be allowed to be better than you.  It's ridiculous.
---
Wait... so you kill people to   a s s e r t   d o m i n a n c e ?
---
It worked for me with 3 weapons and 5 armor pieces, so i guess you have to do so
---
If y‚Äôall could be patient you could at least knock off 50%
---
He thinks we should have taken Oryx‚Äôs place when we killed him, in accordance to the sword logic. He‚Äôs not fond of us wasting our talents by NOT taking over the universe. His dialog in Forsaken is generally taunting and aloof.
---
So when he sees us getting Bad Juju and reacts like a dad when their kid scores a goal... well, it‚Äôs not the BEST thing to hear. Certainly adds to that morally-grey area the game wants us to embrace.
---
a cross you had to bear.. I understand...
---
oh that's a bummer.. well thank you for clarifying!
---
You are both petty and wrong (and kind of a douche). The only non-Lego looking ones I see are the big armored dudes center foreground. 30 seconds of further evaluation makes it clear these are legos. Quit trying to piss on other people's hard work and enjoyment and grow up.
---
Thank you!
---
Yes you need full armor set
---
I‚Äôm just waiting for Uldren to show up like ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs up doc‚Äù
---
I wish my clan would do fun stuff like this or actually join me in my selfie mote
---
That‚Äôs quite a combo
---
Luckily for me after. I managed to get the braytech weapons within no time. the rng gods were very kind to me
---
*In Lord Shaxx Voice* ‚ÄúTHIS IS AMAZING!‚Äù
---
at first i didnt want the emote but because of this now i do
---
Yeah i aint to sure either, i have finished the other 4 same bounties on another character but i haven't turned them in as somebody told me you gotta finish it on the first character you use when you walk into the tribute hall the first time which has been my titan yet nothing is opening, if thats the way its going to be then i shall just have to wait and play something else until tuesday reset unfortunately
---
This was funny
---
Worth it for that precious progress!
---
Worst part is its given me the boons but yet hasn't given me access to them so im able to hand them back to calus for completing the bounties.
---
Wait there is a catalyst for juju?
---
How do u get that I used half of my stuff to get juju and didn't see anything to get catalyst

Sorry, your submission has been automatically removed.

It appears you are asking a question about Destiny 2 error codes or a bug.

We suggest Google searching your error code for more information about what you might be experiencing, or posting in /r/DestinyTechSupport

Agreed. Slidy bois will have nothing on you once you figure out the throw.

You're an idiot.

r/blessedyoga

Yes.

Boy, that sure was a tough one
---
You started the name calling, bud, when you'd called the OP a liar. Hypocrite.
---
Search bar
---
Reading &lt; reading comprehension. 
---
Not at all the case here. It takes multiple reports and instances for it to result in a temporary restriction, which this is. 
---
I play, granted pve mostly, with people from all over the globe and have no issues with connections for most of the time. I'd like to hear from more of the aussie players on this but I still think if you are causing a game to lag you shouldn't be in the game.
---
New sweet business catalyst?!?!
---
But the same result
---
Calus &gt; whores confirmed
---
I know right, really got me sweating.
---
You know what I ran out of? Materials? No. Patience? Not yet. 
---
I ran out of fucking glimmer
---
I believe they should make a more in depth melee system like different weapons are good for different things ex: swords = balanced and versatile axe = more power than a sword but slower etc
---
You can compare the list in game to those revealed in the Bungie Day article posted on Sunday. They gave us a full list of triumphs that will be required.
---
Most people are thinking 2 more will come with Solstice of heroes.
---
I feel the same way too
---
Good for you shame on the people who didn‚Äôt believe you
---
I got booped to my death by a sneaky centurion early on. Started just punching everything toward the end. Died a lot.
---
Bottom tree striker is very good in the hands of a good player but whenever you get destroyed by one he‚Äôs just a good player overall, toss him on another character and he will still do good IMO.
---
Are you sure its the same price? They only go down by 1 with each percent so its not like a huge price drop from a 4% discount. 
---
If you are sure its the same amount, go to orbit and come back or close and re-launch the game.
---
I could just not remember what the original prices were but I heard that with the discount it was supposed to go down a lot
---
No because pinnacle weapons and iron banner stuff this season also has the chalice icon.
---
I bought 1k seraphite and had about 130 phaseglass left over after the 5 tributes
---
Dredgen or wayfarer.
---
I‚Äôm not the op, but yeah, I had a bunch of resources, glimmer, and bright dust.
---
There‚Äôs also a glitch/exploit for tributes if you haven‚Äôt already started.
---
Glory farm on asian servers.
---
You spelled Weasel wrong.

Unfortunately just the triumph.
---
I doubt it.
---
Ahh okay, so essentially it's really only do-able on PC
---
Damned autocorrect...
---
If it's normal strikes then run whatever is most fun. Any weapon can wreck in normal strikes.
---
Maybe needs an update ?
---
Don't open those.  Send them back postage due.
---
When you forget the command to go into creative mode
---
There's a discord server I believe it's called the stringiest cheese that has a full explanation and setup for group finding for the cheese as well
---
Totally agree, I make the same comparison to other games as well when discussing with friends and clan mates. PC has no benefit from the perk whatsoever it‚Äôs just a trash perk with no benefits lol. For console users i like to say it‚Äôs like a drug, once you get a taste of it, you‚Äôre hooked you can‚Äôt play without it. Forces console to abandon dexterity perks and main traction which really kills the diversity of boots for console players. 
---
TLDR: I agree and traction should be intrinsic and not exist as a perk bungie is high.
---
I want fast not fun
---
I mean, you have well over a month to acquire it, it's not like it's a week long event.
---
I was going to say that Toland was the marriage between the sword logic and traveller philosophies, but the traveller doesn‚Äôt have much of a philosophy on its own does it? So I guess it‚Äôs a marriage of the sword logic and guardian philosophies.
---
If you could really seize control of the taken and use them to protect earth, then why not do it? Is there any power in the Destiny universe that is inherently evil?
---
What does that have to do with infinite reload
---
If I have to read this with my own two eyes, then you're getting an upvote so everyone else has to as well.
---
Ok
---
Not with the first ones. If it was 118 materials, then after 4 discounts it goes down to like 110 or something. Its not a big drop each day. Only after you do the full 80% discount will they be MUCH cheaper.
---
I also hope all those edits were worth it!
---
Lol does anyone do it IRL at the same time?
---
Well this really grinds my gears
---
Dang, not even an emblem or anything. I swear it seems like Bungie doesn't understand rewards. The only reason I would do a solo flawless run, would be to show it off with an emblem or something special. When others cannot see your triumphs, things like this feel much more meaningless to me.
---
Ok but I still want infinite reload titans and warlocks have it
---
Good catch. OP is one of these idiots but unfortunately it‚Äôs a silly picture with Destiny in it so he‚Äôll get all the upvotes.
---
You need both.
---
My worlds colliding...
---
Oh but I want to reload without having to punch to reload
---
Same üòÇ
---
Nice
---
Well that is already somewhere in the picture so that's why I'm so confused on what it is
---
That‚Äôs more of a personal thing, as an advocate for enjoying crucible and progressing as a player, I would highly recommend you try your best to improve yourself and earn it, however not everyone has all the time in the world to become a crucible god and unfortunately some of us have lives so I would understand if you simply don‚Äôt have the time to be bashing your head against the wall playing comp and getting those GL kills. At the end of the day that‚Äôs what recoveries should be for, the people who don‚Äôt have time to get the weapons legitimately. Idk your situation but id suggest caution when providing your info to third parties, that‚Äôs just my opinion but if you want to, go for it.
---
Do I see Papa Oryx in the background?
---
I think I was with you guys in front of the ramen shop? Had a lot of funüçú
---
May I ask what emote that is? I think my fireteam needs some yoga as well :D
---
Thank you. FUCKIN autocorrect
---
Congrats, any bow recommendations for us still trying to get it?
---
Because they did a reset yesterday because the exchange made it really easy to but tributes.
---
While I do believe nobody should brag about doing that I can understand players that mainly play pve content that want the pinnacle weapons would use that so they dont have to spend a couple of months learning pvp tactics and meta.
---
I used trinity ghoul. A
---
This is the best thing I think I‚Äôve ever seen in this game so far
---
Wow that's brutal
---
Thanks for the help
---
They did increase the cap, I guess from D1 to D2, and there was much rejoicing... Until we realized they just made everything cost more to compensate. So frustrating.
---
What am I supposed to be looking at
---
My damage
---
Looks like the monster from Stranger Things.
---
Juju does nothing to bosses though lmao
---
fast huh top tree night stalker with the exotic boots for it, recluse mountain top with either a 150rpm grenade launcher that has spike or 1k voices
---
Nnnnope, nothing. I actually got Shadow before getting 1k. This is sad.
---
*Ominous Laughter and distant clapping*
---
Would not surprise me but  I am not sure on specifics of it just know it's a thing.
---
I have none of those weapons but thank you
---
Yeah it kind of pisses me off they did it this way. I dont play often so this is only good for people who play all day every day who have an overload of mats
---
So I just have to swap to a character that hasn't opened the hall and I can just keep placing down the banner tribute each time I load the hall?
---
2ish games versus dozens or hundreds. You decide brother.
---
yeah that one is actually up and to the right, this looks like maybe an ogre boss but not sure.
---
Welp there goes Greg's job!
---
I give to you the FIRST of the Destiny sub classes I'll be creating. I plan on hitting ALL of the sub classes including the alternative supers of each. Needless to say, I've got my work cut out for me.  I just wanted to give YOU, my fellow guardians, another way to celebrate your class of choice. I hope my work and future works will make you proud! Check the link to watch the time lapse, in the description of the video you can find the links to grab the looped video and standard image for free!

Yes
---
I think so. I never did that so I'm not sure
---
thought you were deleting?
---
Sad fuck
---
It is Xol.
---
You‚Äôre right, it was. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs posted on his reddit account.
---
If the Hive corrupted a Sweet Business
---
Can you do this on your second and third characters? Or do the doors remain open for all once the first has opened them? I did not know about this and wish I did :(.
---
Go ahead and read what I typed out then. Your 3 cross save characters are available on all platforms all the time. There is no limit to the number of times you change platforms.
---
I was just linking to his Instagram Incase people wanted to see more of his stuff
---
Not sure what you‚Äôre referring to...
---
Yeah I have just read.
---
This is the cutest.
---
He's right next to it on the poster
---
This season's ships are all so weird looking.  On one hand, it's cool that they're trying a new look that's a big departure from past designs.  On the other hand, they mostly (one or two exceptions) look boring and ugly to me.  I'm sure some people like them.
---
Can Ghosts choose what they want to repair at a Guardian? If so, maybe they just don't repair the cramps. Guardians have a somewhat superhuman pain insensitivity, so maybe they're just standing through it.
---
Looks great!
---
The shadow title my friend , and that's the difference right there between casual and hardcore.  Congratulations btw it looks nice
---
Light.gg works for me but they have pop up and redirect ads alot so be careful if you do use it.
---
You can use the database website light.gg though it does include items that are no longer obtainable. So for example, if you looked up an item that used to drop from Trials of the Nine, it will still say on it that it comes from Trials of the Nine and it is up to you, the player, to understand that this is an activity that has been removed from the game.
---
Thank you
---
Cry more lul
---
Absolutely fantastic build!  Congratulations.  
---
You even put in that cursed HVT Servitor that either:
---
\-Arrives when I am low on health and kills me
---
\---or---
---
\-Is a Spider bounty and departs 5 seconds after I arrive...
---
Whats the exploit?
---
Lul you're late SCRUB. garbage kid probably got carried through it by that ivy doomsday guy LUL LOSER
---
I wish he would :(
---
Seems like a fun fight, almost definitely better than the damn Exodus Crash boss who's just a massive pain
---
Can you still cheese this if you already progressed further in the quest? I just found this out and I had 7 tributes in already
---
I thought you got whooshed, but it was i who was whooshed. By Gammatrap no less. I love the work you do in Byf's videos.
---
I wonder if I abandon and restart on another character if I can do this.
---
I'll let you know when I do work in Byf's videos lol
---
The forge should not be very hard to a) matchmake people, I did 3-4 the other day and queued up in about a minute each b) solo it anyway, shouldn‚Äôt be hard if you‚Äôre over 630ish which you should be well past c) lfg for it, if playing solo sucks so much why do you refuse to lfg?
---
Whisper isn‚Äôt terribly hard to solo, definitely not easy, but not the hardest thing. Use arcstrider and switch back and forth between lucky raspberry and raiden flux. Polaris Lance for bosses
---
4
---
Ya. Possibly. I‚Äôm gunna say no it won‚Äôt work. I‚Äôm sure the doors opening is a checkpoint, account wide sorta thing
---
Facts can hurt, good thing they are not based on your feelings.. chick.
---
Good catch hittem with them facts baby
---
Why wouldn't they? I don't know if you've been up to speed, but they kinda have been releasing a lot of iconic exotics that are fan favorites. Like. Y'know. Thorn, Last Word, Truth, Bad Juju, Thunderlord. Last I checked, everybody hated Dragonsbreath. The questline that's coming up syncs perfectly for Gjallarhorn's questline for Destiny 1 Year 3. Y'know. Collecting pieces for a greater whole. The literal quote from the datamines that show it's a rocket launcher that you are collecting pieces for.
---
Having a full set of armor and weapons on will give you the most progress, so it's not necessary but it will take you a lot, and I mean a lot, longer to progress using just a weapon.
---
You don't look like Will Farrell at all
---
Wondering this as well, please bgg update if you find out.
---
Thank you! Dumb follow up question: would it help to have multiple weapons such as mob justice and sins along with primus (the armor gods have not been kind to me)
---
Since the bounties update every day, I'm gonna try the cheese from the start. I'm at 7 tributes already, so I'm doubtful. But I'll definitely let everyone know
---
Just roll with as much of the gear as you can to gain the most progress I'd assume, I haven't tried personally but I would assume more the better.
---
It's probably placing the last tribute
---
He has credited you several times. Are you the same one he talks about?
---
I‚Äôm torn on it. At least it‚Äôs consensual vs Ddosing. It doesn‚Äôt help though that the pve meta guns are locked behind quite difficult pvp content. It‚Äôd be different if it was more like the sniper rifle, where your progress can‚Äôt go backwards. It also doesn‚Äôt help that you have to contend with streamers doing account recoveries. You might not find it hard to get to fabled but many people do. I struggle with pvp and it brings out the worst in me :). If I could do this method, I think I might be tempted. Wouldn‚Äôt be proud of it though and if people in my clan found out it‚Äôd be frowned upon for sure.
---
They are $10 a piece or $25 total when you buy the $60 version.
---
So is it better to buy the deluxe?
---
Yeah true. But still, kills a kill.
---
Can the mods of this sub please sticky a post where it's confirmed that this is an issue for everyone? Getting quite bored with someone asking this every 15 minutes.
---
If you see people using cheesy weapons. Use the same weapon. Be better than them with it. Use the meta. Communicate with your team. Adjust your settings. Change your play style. Stop complaining that competitive isn't casual enough for you.
---
What an awesome clan name haha. Thank you so much I will definitely check them out!
---
I really didn‚Äôt expect the hug...
---
Rat King is hella fun for an inviz hunter build.
---
It's a great support build since you can essentially go invisible anytime you want. It was my go to build all the way up to end game of Forsaken. 
---
Pair it with the exotic helmet that buffs invisibility. Sorry but I forgot the name of it. Graviton something.
---
And yes, the recent string of bugs in countdown suck. There's no fix for that.
---
I don't atcually know. I know some game modes a cap point will spawn and first team to cap it wins. So maybe that.
---
I ended up popping my super and just emoting
---
No where in my post did i complain about it not being casual enough or op weapons (except official op weapons, like LoW where even the devs admitted)
---
Someone in that lobby did.
---
Then i Erentil'd him.
---
Also it was completely on accident and was more of a panic button mash so I did not mean to do it
---
True. Also super damage reduction and erentil and j√∂tuun
---
Yeah who the fuck takes advantages in comp?
---
You are not required to pick up the abandoned quest. I was afraid to. Just checked my progress in Triumphs and it's counted all 9. Just so people know :)
---
It's a known bug, no fix as of yet though.
---
Nothing to do but wait for a fix.
---
No, it shouldnt! No other weapon or activity works like this in the entire game! If your shit in quickplay, you still will get to a high valor by time.
---
If you're shit in gambit, you still will get to a high enough  points in time. Nightfall and other stuff as well. Only comp is different in a bad way
---
S e a r c h b a r
---
Counters that take alot more effort than you have to put in to beat them. 
---
But you've just admitted you are ok with gear carrying you, so there's no point in continuing this. I'll just go ahead and block you.
---
When it's 1 v 4, they already have advantage. No need to be complete pricks in the process.

It's COMPETITIVE. It's COMPETITIVE  for a reason. It's not meant to be easy. It's not meant to be a grind to the top. You're lucky you weren't around for loss streaks. Seriously bro. Play 3 matches a week and wait till reset if you're that upset about losing rank.

---
Can confirm, you can just drop triumphs all the way to 45 and then do the quest and claim the catalyst immediately after.
---
Anarchy? I wonder which raid your doing
---
You're a disgrace to all hunter mains. Peace.
---
We all know comp is an absolute shitstorm, but that‚Äôs part of the challenge.
---
It might as well be over soon. I usually emote the other guy with a Hello or a handshake.
---
So what is it you want? Should they not kill you at all because you're alone? Should they let you win? What?
---
I hate you. I really do. This is beyond horrible
---
Never knew you could complete it with lost sectors, thanks I‚Äôll try that!!
---
I'm not defending comp by any means. But to let just anyone get every comp weapon is a bit ridiculous.
---
You should replace wait with leave.
---
I was thinking of switching to my titan then attempt to sword fly once u fall out of the map, that would be pretty cool. It might be a bit hard to recreate tho
---
You‚Äôre right it is pretty fun! frustrating when you keep missing though haha
---
Sure thing! good luck!
---
I‚Äôve hoarded thousands of gunsmith materials. The time has come.
---
Found your problem: you're on console.
---
Mama didn't raise a rage quitter
---
That could be possible, it would be cool to see the area i saw before when i was falling up close.
---
That‚Äôs not the cause
---
We had just gotten back from scourge of the past, and were on our way to CoS
---
Could you upload a screenshot?
---
No, not what i said at all. But they dont have to pop supers and grab all the heavy, double or triple team when youre already fighting someone. You can easily see when the enemy is down in numbers. Not hard to not be a trash player.
---
And they say hoarding is a mental illness...
---
r/cursedcomments
---
Imagine Lord Saladins reaction seeing Outbreak Perfected in the Iron Banner
---
Holy fuck that‚Äôs amazing
---
Cyclops die in one shot of mountaintop, why are you leaving them alive to kill somebody?
---
I grab them ALL for this kind of reason
---
Depends on you, man. If you‚Äôre a complitionist or really like Bad Juju, I‚Äôd definitely go for it. It‚Äôs a really fun gun to use and gives a lot of super energy for kills with the exotic perk activated.
---
Graviton Forfeit is a decent substitute
---
Good lordy, that happened. But no, I just need shorts that don't unlock my phone.
---
Done. (Sorry about the long wait time for my response)
---
With the amount of shards I burned today working on getting Wayfarer, I think it‚Äôs time to cash in.
---
I play every day so I‚Äôm confident I can earn it all back.
---
*laughs nervously with 100 Glimmer and 100 Shards*
---
I laughed so hard lmaooooo
---
Triumph glitch? What is it?
---
Trans icon
---
I usually dislike memes of this style, but tbf, this one is perfect. bravo
---
so pretty much if you go to calus‚Äô statue and grab the invitation, you can get the triumph he gives you but if don‚Äôt put it down and switch to another character then place it you can repeat the process until you get all 50
---
if you have the door open already then you can‚Äôt do it
---
Nice shot!  What roll?
---
Tiny edit?
---
Hey man just trying to get the game over with fast as possible, nothing personal
---
Grow dummy thicc with strength
---
How come shanks don‚Äôt have a crit spot
---
What is this sorcery
---
I work with Myelin lol but I'm friends with byf, so sometimes I'll do a thing or two for him.
---
Absolutely ace that you posted this! Got Juju with the catalyst and I‚Äôm good to go! Thanks again!
---
I hate d2, but I love this post.
---
Myelin is Australian lol
---
Kill the taken meatball until it drops.
---
Enjoy bro!
---
I'm glad bud! :)
---
Yep
---
Its a variant of the playing the odds emblem, if you go to the original emblem there is an option to change to that one.
---
Oh thank you! :)
---
Hahah explain to me what the Lord has to do with your feelings being hurt by facts backed by data and statistics? I‚Äôll wait
---
My boys in Destiny: New Light
---
Real question. 
---
If a male Guadian is having some Woohoo time alone, will the Ghost know?
---
My acreen set ups are wierd. Id have to crop the image
---
I've already started a golden gun hunter lol. But have ideas for a titan after that
---
Nope just hammered
---
Yeah the well broke as hell for the past three or four days
---
My 4stack yesterday had something similar.
---
2 of the guys on the other team left after we were up 50 points or so.
---
We just danced with one of the guys left, while the 2nd dude remaining kept potshotting us from miles away.
---
I think we used 5 supers on him.
---
This isn‚Äôt the comp that I know. There‚Äôs no tea-bagging. What parallel universe is this?
---
It‚Äôs on the roof in castellum near cup. There‚Äôs not a barrier and you can jump onto a small hole in the wall. And viola, your glitched now
---
Lol maybe
---
Yeah, I always tell my clan never to kill lone players or 2 players unless of course, they want to fight lol. Still we either 1v1 or 2v2 depending. Also, clan rules, we never tea-bag unless someone starts it first.
---
SeArChBaR
---
Yes, it is known by bungo
---
I used it and nothing came up wanna link it?
---
So transcharacter?
---
I play pvp only for a certain exotic I have no hope of getting. Getting stuck on teams full of AFK bots and against teams full of cheese and what I sometimes expect are either aim hacks or some kind of auto aim controller exploit on PC. It has me so pissed I can't even play the game now.
---
I would rather play CSGO comp and deal with that insanity than play destiny 2. At least people on CSGO actually communicate. NOT ONE person in 50 matches I played had any interest in communicating. 
---
In short, I hate people.
---
Don't you also have a button to take screenshots with?
---
Sounds like Shadow Rifts opening during Escalation Protocol.
---
The stuff of myth triumph is for recluse not Mountaintop
---
most likely this
---
Indeed
---
Moon's haunted.
