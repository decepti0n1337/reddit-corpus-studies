Thats a dope helm
---
---
---
You do realize that those bad players can be on both teams right? Not just yours?
---
Ohh..! I didn't realize there was so much depth to all this. Nice job, Bungie.
---

---
Tnx for the info :D
---
My Titan too fat to squeeze through. Need a slim and skiny hunter to get it for me. :(
---
[removed]
---
Yea it's just hard to find teams for older raids sometimes because after a dlc comes they usually become irrelevant, but I guess it's not destiny 1 so older raids still give good gear. I'll try it outüòÄ
---
I think the deliberate darkening is on purpose.
---
Also, it‚Äôs really not that cartoony.
---
I'll check it out. thanks!
---
Laughs in geomag

Got huckleberry earlier today.....
---
I pretty much always find good groups on the reddit dicords, only 'toxicity' i run into is just the occasional lemon who thinks they're better than everyone else because they have more completions.

My favorite part of destiny

---
You up for a run? I still haven't got the rare bounty, but I'd love to do shattered throne for wish ender anyway.
---
I have heard that there will be a new armor system that renders current armor obsolete. More details will be coming "soon" according to Bungie, such as whether this applies to the Solstice of Heroes armor set that comes out at the end of this month. 
---
I have not heard anything in regards to guns.
---
That's certainly vexing.
---
Loot cave sessions where crazy
---
Was playing with some very chill randoms recently when this dude joined and started getting agitated because we weren't doing speedrunning strats. He was one of the most arrogant people I've ever met but everyone was just laughing at him by the end.
---
I'm about to try running top tree arcstrider with a one-two punch shotgun, tractor cannon and liar's handshake. Every labyrinth architect should die in one punch, but I haven't gotten to dul incaru to test.
---
I literally just finished this. It's not that bad. If you haven't reset your infamy this season or gotten the pinnacle weapons grind towards that and you'll get malfeasance.
---
Shit, tomorrow will be 2 weeks that I haven't been able to play. I should have known better than to build a new AMD PC on launch day.
---
‚úã
---
Also it gets double the ammo of a regular shotty, letting them use the "ammo dump" mode as the regular firing mode. (Just imagine if Izanagi's Burden got double the ammo to allow for way more 1-shots.)
---
Fun fact: The Dj‚Äôs are Modestep! Forsure check them out if you‚Äôre into dubstep.
---
Last word is better, change my mind
---
I would say it is worth it, I did it with 2 to 3  friends aswell so it was pretty easy
---
I‚Äôm doing the quest right now it seems easy and I‚Äôm not good at PvP
---
Awesome Sauce
---
OOOH there he goes *zooooooom*
---
I feel bad, I got mine on my second run ever.
---
Probably both since FF only requires a kill and outlaw requires a headshot kill. Outlaw is still obviously top tier though.
---
This. This is amazing.
---
D1: I‚Äôm a Warlock so I must use Self-Res Sticky‚Äôs

When doing a weapon frame, farm the afelion rest i think is called, a lost sector in dreaming city, a lot of enemies and the boss give you 10 motes, whit 2 runs youre done.
---
Im looking at you crota
---
Because its my job to fix it? Will bungie pay me to do it? Its their fking game, they have to fix a game like that
---
Oh look, the rank I‚Äôve never been able to surpass in any season yet üòÇ 
---
Someone help lmao
---
Sorry fellow gamer
---
Yeah he's playing a set at Lollapalooza this year.
---
‚ÄúPoor fellow‚Äù lol and yes, I hate shotguns in any FPS PvP game.
---
Wdym decrypted key? This isn‚Äôt escalation protocolüòÇ
---
Lmfao yeah I didn‚Äôt reply to the right comment
---
O ok
---
Wait what?? I thought you still needed the decrypted key to open a chest at the end? 
---
Is that how you get the armor then? Cause that‚Äôs legit all that‚Äôs keeping me from Wayfarer
---
Definitely reccomend a targeting adjuster mod üëçcongratz!
---
Poor fellow as in a dude trying to weave and dodge the Erentils, LoWs, snipers, Handheld Supernovas and Heavy just to get into that sweet spot. Also idk why you hate shotguns in FPS‚Äô they‚Äôre mostly balanced with the exception of Battlefield and CoD.
---
I only use this in Comp. Luckily I‚Äôll be out of there soon. Lol
---
There are two possible fixes from what I have heard. Try opening the pursuits tab and claiming any bounties you completed in the course of the match, or try opening the character menu and dismantling one shader. 
---
I have absolutely no clue why these work, but sometimes they fix this problem.
---
Ah yes, the great hero of Twilight Gap and coordinator of the Crucible, the venerable Lord Shaq.
---
Hunters gotta hit em with the Ninja bag ^TM
---
Yeah that was nuts. 
---
Bungie: we're taking away weapons of light because its a Raid crutch
---
Also Bungie: here's a new super that's weapons of light, and also increased range and also you don't need to duck in and out of it to keep activiating it, and fuck it here's an exotic as well so you never need to reload while you're buffed as well.
---
Short answer: yes
---
So glad I‚Äôm done with comp. Was stuck in heroic 3 for like 2 weeks, and then 1 Saturday, I went on a 5 win streak to fabled. wth
---
Sentinal Titan's Ward of Dawn, top tree, activated by holding the bumpers down.
---
How do you use it during SoTP?
---
That‚Äôs the only time I bag; that sweet, sweet revenge kill on someone who‚Äôs better than me. Because I know how infuriating it is to them. 
---
They‚Äôre better than me, and the stats are there to prove it. 
---
But, just that one time... I was better than them for just a couple seconds...
---
And I‚Äôm gonna make sure you never forget it.
---
Yes but it‚Äôs clear that they‚Äôre just taking out Destiny 2 for Destiny to almost a fluid process the employees can probably do all the computer/paperwork without looking.
---
Where is this pic from?
---

What?

Always a special moment.

Ok so imagine you‚Äôre a game stop employee and every so often not every day but frequently enough that you get used to it someone brings in Destiny 1 for Destiny 2 because of a promotion. Which typically complicates the process but since the Employees are used to it the entire process is a lot easier.
---
Shadowkeep is looking good.
---
Should get a triumph for that
---
It used to be on the Bungie store. Not sure if there‚Äôs a real place to get it now, but the one in the post isn‚Äôt the real shirt. OP and two others in the comments are bots for a company that steals designs and sells cheap, low-quality ripoffs.
---
Not confirmed yet if they steal card info, but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised, and I wouldn‚Äôt risk it if you see a t-shirt link on Reddit. Once you see it a few times, you can tell the fake sites apart
---
You think destiny 2 is cartoony?
---
Do the gunsmiths  bounties or leviathan raid. Leviathan raid gives a lot of masterworked armor and weapons for enhancement cores
---
You mean a sub where you can make another post that will get me karma? Sweet. I would say r/iamverysmart is what you are looking for, except I've never really claimed to be the smartest person out there. Relative to you in our discussion I have, but there are certainly far smarter people than I out there. Good night and happy shitposting!
---
Your Mida does that much damage. Dang, that's the strongest scout ever..................
---
At least it's not aeon swift
---
Do banshee‚Äôs, the gunsmith, bounties. You can pick up 3 dailies and two weeklies. Also, completing the clan XP for Hawthorne usually gives you a decent handful, 5-7 cores I think. And you can get special consumables from dismantling items that when used give you a chance at getting a core to drop from a boss type enemy. I think it is finest matterweave.
---
This. Look, I‚Äôm an average player, and some people take this shit way too seriously. If you‚Äôre being a totally try hard in QP, I‚Äôm gonna bag your ass every time you die just because I know it will make some no life turd rage just a little extra hard that day.  They‚Äôre usually not even close to pro material, calm the fuck down , kiddo lol.

I got that second run

Yea but I decided that I was gonna do a melee video

I just bought this from Xur today too! Love trace rifles

But it's still a fleshlight so I don't see an issue here

That was the first non-story given exotic I ever got. I got it from my first flashpoint (Nessus) and it was awesome.
---
Noice
---
The Engram's description clearly states "will contain a new Exotic if any remain to be collected." If it was working as intended, it would have given the Helm of Saint-14. It's not his fault that the description is misleading.
---
I believe it is supposed to only give Year 1 exotics, as I haven't gotten any of the Exotics from the Annual Pass for my Titan. Saint-14 is CoO, so there is definitely something wrong there.
---
There is one like it for beating curse called the Prometheus lens and I love that thing so much
---
I main Warlock and almost consistently stay in the top 2 on my team, at least 80% of the time‚Äî wish I had the balls to consistently play comp but I play solo primarily lest I can drag my friend back in sometimes. Despite the mega-nerd, Nova Warp got semi-patched back up a little thankfully, so I‚Äôve gone back to it. I think bottom-Dawnblade is objectively better, but I‚Äôm kicking Guardian booty with ol‚Äô void-life‚Äî but don‚Äôt disown ANY tree. Play around‚Äî especially with the trees you aren‚Äôt experienced with; you might surprise yourself with how it pairs with your gun/gameplay.
---
Best advice I can give is make sure you have weapons that COMPLIMENT each other, like a close-mid and a mid-long or somewhere on the spectrum of which you can experiment with. Right now I‚Äôm shredding charging apes with Cerberus+1, and Astrocyte Verse made Blink a sex-panther again. Transversive Steps, Ophidian Aspects, Contraverse Hold/Getaway if Arc-style are all fantastic. Right Side of Wrong , Epicurean, and Beloved (when I want to pump the numbers to working on Revoker) compliment Cerberus for me. Bygones/Blast Furnace with masterwork/good rolls, I‚Äôll dabble with too with a trusty Sidearm or maybe SMG, definitely be open to switching it up and not relying too hard on one set. 
---
ALSO‚Äî if you quickly realize an enemy is constantly going ham with a sniper/shotty/any special weapon and clearly formidable... go double primary. Deny them any special ammo if they manage to kill you. It‚Äôs not much, but it might just be the lack of ammo that saves your teammate around the corner. That‚Äôs just my mentality, at least. If you‚Äôre confident with your allies, take that advice at situational discretion. 
---
PS, if you‚Äôre a fellow console player, Traction perk on your shoes. For real. Unless it‚Äôs exotic boots, if your legendary boots don‚Äôt have Traction, shard them. Shard them now.
---
Also, reading where your blueberry teammates are‚Äî when I started driving 100 years ago, my mom made it a point to say that you have to think FOR the other drivers on the road, because you might be the only one doing the thinking. Apply that to the Crucible. I‚Äôve been dabbling in CammyCakes ‚Äúsupport-Warlock‚Äù build with Lumina, middle-Solar double-grenade, and have been not only pulling my team out of grease-fires they should have died in, but sitting at top of the scoreboard. Heck, watch some of Cammy‚Äôs other videos where he plays around with non-meta builds‚Äî I love going back and watching his Crimil‚Äôs Dagger/Hero‚Äôs Burden video because he commentates during gameplay why he‚Äôs doing what he‚Äôs doing.
---
Wow I‚Äôm sorry for the wall of text, I kept looking up and watching 30 Rock that I let the length of the post get away from me.
---
What happened to this gun being a pre order bonus
---
Huh, that's cool. How often do people enter tho? Over only ever seen people run bubble boy a couple of times in pvp.
---
Did you return his weapon to him at least?
---
Y1 armor
---
I've opted to use Fixed Odds with Rangefinder and No Distractions. It's just as annoying!
---
Hey man, those 60+ FPS &amp; bigger FoV are too damn attractive to pass up haha.
---
Fucking liar.
---
Not often but when they do it with a super so suppress is amazing. I pop it on points and high activity spots.
---
Ah, gotcha. Any way to get it in 2019?
---
Oh I guess I did find that guy a couple times.  Assumed he spawned as part of some mission.

This literally happened to me JUST TODAY! I dismantled it immediately XD.

Grenade recharge is one of the modifiers, which effects shield throws

They confirmed it is after because if you played during the last one and this one you get an exclusive emblem to commemorate that you were there while the wolves ran wild. Its in the twab

That's true friendship. One of my clanmates has bailed on our group that we've had for 1yr+ because we couldn't get CoS done quick enough.
---
Good times /s
---
Uhh most destinations do have a day/night cycle. And titan has a weather system. Yes would like to see weather changes on other destinations.
---
More ghost voices is way to costly.
---
Paragon/renagade karma system thing. Would work in destiny unless it became more rpg less shooter/mmo cause it would need a whole rewrite to story to allow for choices and dialogue options (our character barely speaks).
---
Yeah, Destiny 1 had much more of a "Halo inspired" tactical look, especially on the titans.
---
Use Astrocyte Verse
---
You can test around the map
---
I'm pretty sure it came with the 'premium' edition. You can buy a boost for silver, however but I think it costs around 37$
---
I want to nuke
---
I mean, I don't know if you have ever enjoyed using MT Recluse in a Luna Rift/Well (or Huckleberry Loaded Question, whatever) but Lunarift does things nothing else inthe game does. The range increase is insane for submachine guns, loaded question gets on a whole new level, phoenix just doesn't give you that

Reddit detective back at it again
---
I still get excited for sure, but I miss the wonderment. Playing Destiny for 5 years and learning the ins and outs of every little crevasse in the the game makes it a little less magical. Kinda like how you wish you could rewatch a favorite show or movie for the first time
---
Oh let me do that right now
---
Yeah exactly

Nur the catalyst isnt out yet?
---
I dont like gambit so much, but its okay... Think just gonna let the quest opened and doin it by the way

Thanks! :)

Thank you so much! It's my first drawing in Paint and I'm so proud :)

Whatever you want, you can always pull it out of your collections.

Was it haunted?

I don't play much comp, what is keeping you from using them?
---
Class balance genius.
---
Titans are overpowered already in pvp.
---
Making them viable in pve would render other classes useless.
---
Bye.
---
The problem is that although i play hunter, i like to play support, and aeon swift does that.
---
Nope, my Crucible loadout is Service Revolver, Recluse, and really any exotic power weapon, it changes from time to time
---
5 seconds later? I haven‚Äôt played since right before the black armory came out. Is this figuratively or literally speaking? üòÖ I feel like I‚Äôve missed a lot
---
Eh true. If that's what you like I won't argue it
---
Is it good in PvP? Im trying to use exotics as an upper hand to gain in rank
---
Nothing, hes fine.
---
Don‚Äôt mean to burst your bubble, but Aeon armor doesn‚Äôt really do anything if your teammates aren‚Äôt wearing Aeon armor, and nobody use Aeon armor.
---
What're we looking at exactly?
---
If your going to try it I'll let you know the perfect 5th OS on a timer once toy get it, but not when your only on 3 stacks. Secondly rally barricade doesn't count as a reload, so won't reset the counter if you use it to refill the magazine.
---
Show me your motivation
---
If you're running tractor cannon you should at least have a special Grenade Launcher, even if it doesn't have spike nades it's better than nothing, just because someone is using tractor cannon doesn't mean they can't do damage, unless they pop banner shield after booping the boss

By dismantling black armory weapons that you forged, you get stuff (I don't remember the name), 1 for a normal weapon and 3 for a heavy IIRC.
---
You can turn that in to Ada (on page two), one of these + 10 mod components = 1 random black armory mod (you've got to be a bit lucky but rampage spec drops eventually)
---
Also it's one try every day max, otherwise the price goes up
---
*Immune*
---
Amazing game, especially since it‚Äôs free. I find myself swapping between warframe and destiny often.
---
Nice.
---
That‚Äôs where you‚Äôre kinda wrong. If I‚Äôm second or tertiary well for bosses like insurrection, one of the other locks will rift or a Titan will rally.

Nice

I‚Äôve never touched gambit (still not trusting this Drifter), but if I do, I‚Äôd be serving motes for my teammates, keep a lookout for invading scum and kicking Primeval-butt... while keeping a lookout for invading scum. Or whatever my teammates are *NOT* doing that they *SHOULD* be doing.
---
Nah he‚Äôs good
---
I‚Äôve heard warframe is a good game but I just cant get over the way it looks.
---
It just looks...odd to me. I prefer to look like a badass space marine insteD
---
Did you atleast get one with decent perks? It's not about having the gun itself if it doesn't have good rolls. That's why farming this shotgun is so obnoxious. +80 runs on The Hollowed Lair makes me hate the shotgun more than getting killed by it in PvP üòÑ
---
!remindme 44 days
---
What is that and how do I exploit it
---
I think slova bomb does more total damage but the other one doesn't.
---
I wish I could be him
---
.......are you serious right now? it deals the same damage as any 110 but the damage is split. please get your facts straight. go test it right now. then you come back here and tell me i was right. go ahead, i'll be here waiting.
---
This is part of an adventure from before warming came out, it heavily hinted about Mars and rasputin
---
Oh, you didnt hear?
---
Ok so I looked it up, and geomags + chaos reach does more damage than slova bomb but slova bomb can do better add clear. But slova with tractor does more than geomags
---
Celestial nighthawk &gt; Nova + tractor &gt; geomags + chaos reach &gt; Nova &gt; chaos
---
No wonder he was only using his hand cannon and Golden gun. His save file was restarted
---
Chaos reach

All I want is for Ward of Dawn to be restored to its former glory. I used to be a bubble main all the way in PvE and PvP but now it‚Äôs borderline useless

This message is sponsored by the Praxic Order.
---
Titans suck.
---
As a titan main I find this hitting close to home along with the fact that we just usually place rally barricades and then shoot with our shotguns
---
good idea
---
RNG is a bitch. I've gotten this dang thing twice (only in the last couple weeks) gotten all the ships and sparrows and ghosts anyone could want but no damn raid exotics. So I guess I only get the useless stuff
---
You should try looking at the lfg on the companion app. That's where i got my raid clears from especially for first time clears

I approve

Inb4 I know my bald Hunter is ugly, but I figured it would be weird to be a vendor with a helmet on in the tower.

Hush is a fucking pain in the ass, far worse than breakneck. Every match is a gamble, you think you made 3% progress and actually made 1%. Then you think you probably made 0% progress and suddenly you made 3%. It's so annoying, got the kills done and am only at 30%. Probably not even gonna finish it, so done with gambit.
---
Outperformed by the Austringer, which is actually outperforming every legendary HC.
---
Yeah they feel so weak when it‚Äôs a bottom tree striker or a sentinel shield that lasts for days or when they‚Äôre meleeing you into a wall for an instant kill or they have the (still!) most OP exotic in the game (but shards had to be nerfed twice right?). So weak!
---
Titan supers are worse than a single recluse for ad clear change my mins
---
I feel like it won't happen because of Well of Radiance offering the exact same thing but with the ability for players to shoot out of it (although that also means enemies can shoot into it). Maybe giving it all the abilities it had in D1 (armor, blessing, and weapons of light) with a smaller buff than Well but with the ability to shoot out of the bubble. Essentially you are completely covered from enemy fire with the trade off receiving a lower buff in comparison to Well.
---
One less voice in the song... you always notice it...

So you made a Zavala hunter huh?

Me too. There's a rocket launcher with intrinsic tracking? I've dismantled so many of these.

Guess even Zavala realized what the currently state of Titans is.

I always try getting back into it after updates but shit only last an hour till the grindfest starts.

---
Titans could probably reach the same level of Melee damage with the throwing hammer and wormgods caress. 
---
Except that exotic is fucking garbage because you have 4 seconds per stack vs the 20 seconds Hunters have for combination blow. Also it hardly works with one two punch since you have to be far enough away to have the hammer throw, but close enough to get all pellets to hit.

What about shattering strike on spectrals

Honestly, if they invade during the primeval phase and you known you aren't equipped to fight them, its not a bad idea
---
I love seeing things like this. Arc webs are another of my favorite answers to the death ball. D2Y1 cemented it as the go too LFG team strat even today.
---
Dang, I got this and the entire D2 launch special edition, the sentinel shield and the iron Gally for 175 at GameStop a few months ago. Picked up a bunch of Kingdom Hearts and Yu-Yu Hakusho figures too. GameStop is going under fast. If there's one near you, check them out from time to time. They're E B. Games in other countries I believe.
---
No, he did not. It was a body double that switched with him in the end of a cutscene. He's alive somewhere on an island.
---
It doesn't have to be one way mate. Why should any class have it shit? You can literally be for nerfing titan pvp strength and buffing pve strength lmao
---
I still own it and I gladly will! In memory of Cayde, gone but not forgotten!!
---
My Hunter uses it lol got the Colonel Ornament on it
---
Shotgun stagger tho.

*coughs in Recluse* But yeah, I get what you mean, and I should have specified.

Again with the Cayde gear "hey... take me with you"

Your welcome, I liked using the ice breaker or the no land, hopefully I get the same feeling with the REVOKER, plus as I progress with this quest I feel like I'm improving with my Snipes, also now I love using the beloved over and other snipers at the moment
---
One encounter clear should get a third chest at the end on top of a faster clear. Second chest should be unlocked with chalice upgrades

---
Hell yeah !!
---
Yo what shotty you using with your side-arm? LotW?
---
Black talon is my jam! I used to main a hunter through D1 and D2, and eventually added a little diversity to my friend squad of 5 hunters so I main a titan now. As soon as Stronghold came out, I became a light swordsman and it is by far the most fun I‚Äôve had in destiny. Running around like an insane person and receiving full health for perfect blocks, on top of Black talons long range slash attacks or world lines teleporting sword ability there‚Äôs just no going back hahahaha

I usually feel pretty amused with it. Haha, thought you were going to heal the primeval huh? Guess again.
---
man, all this makes me think i'll never be able to raid. im a titan main and i've never played a raid (sinse I just dont have the friends to do it on destiny)
---
now from what i get if im lfg as a titan I might as well not try at all
---
I read on other sub pulses are getting nerfed. As they outshine scouts. I wonder if this is true
---
Basically you buy the low light level armor from Hawthorne, drop your light level and then queue up a forge and afk. The forge timer ends before the afk timer, so you just keep requeuing for forges, but you aren't bothering people who are trying to do it legit because dropping your light level stops you from queueing with them.
---
You get...something for it. Planetary mats maybe? Idk because I don't like to exploit mechanics like that so I haven't done it.
---
Again, I‚Äôm not talking about Ward of Dawn. I misspoke.
---
Sentinel titan I believe. 
---
So let‚Äôs not talk about ward of dawn.
---
Challenge? Graviton Lance. It is actually fun to try and get additional kills from the orbs when the other team groups up. That‚Äôs what I used to complete mine.
---
Rule #10 no LFG posts
---
I wish I had friends. Anyway good luck on your journey guardians
---
SEARCH BAR BUD

I had 3 4k hours in that game and every player I saw said warframe was better. I played destiny 2 campaign when they made it free. I instantly bought forsaken after it. Then I bought the annual pass. Warframe is trash near this game. The content warframe devs create are nowhere near bungie. They shut down raids in that game because players was stupid that cant do the raids. That was the only thing that I could consider endgame.
---
People just use what the YouTubers tell them is good on a weekly, monthly or seasonal basis.
---
Check your local stores, i bought Destin 2 Forsaken : The complete collection for just 14 euros for xbox one on Friday ( Bartsmit Belgium). You might get lucky also.
---
Bruh cringeBruh cringeBruh cringeBruh cringeBruh cringeBruh cringeBruh cringeBruh cringeBruh cringeBruh cringeBruh cringeBruh cringeBruh cringeBruh cringeBruh cringeBruh cringeBruh cringeBruh cringeBruh cringeBruh cringeBruh cringe
---
Maybe it could be viewed as a yyyuuuuuge  buff to scouts while keeping pulses in their respective
---
Man Lord of Wolves is such bullshit. Its by far and away the most broken gun since the Lens lasertag fiasco
---
As a fellow Titan, I can definitely say with confirm that you are a seriously lucky fellow. What was the grind for? Recluse?
---
This is for the adventure called ‚ÄúArecibo.‚Äù It heavily hints at the Warmind expansion, I recommend running it if you can. It‚Äôs a fun little mission to run
---
Don't let blueberries get you triggered man.
---
Sintenal shield? Banner shield?
---
I tried to like it so many times, just isn't satisfying to play
---
It was not intentional. ‚ò∫Ô∏è I dropped my controller at the end of that emote. I use an elite lol.
---
Banner shield, thank you.
---
Lmao
---
Well, but with the 1-2 Punch &amp; Top tree Arcstrider Combo Hunters basically became the better Titans..
---
I also thought it was more, but I can assure you, it isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs pathetic that that‚Äôs even a thing that people are unsure of, because of how shit it‚Äôs damage is.
---
Lol got mine on Friday never touching last wish again....
---
You are a garbage human for telling people to kill themselves for underperforming in a video game and deserve every loss you get, both in game and in life. No wonder you have to solo queue.
---
Try r/fireteams or LFG at the top of the page
---
too late, got supended from psn for a week
---
it will probably be 750+ seeing as new light players get to start at 750
---
That‚Äôs the super that is being referenced here. It‚Äôs being used for DPS, because it‚Äôs buffing DPS. Hunters are definitely the only class (besides the rare slova bomb) that should use super on the boss.
---
Grow up.
---
Make the bubble larger. Like 2-3x as large. I wanna build a wall like the other titans
---
If they are that trash I wonder how they dont get more hate mail for real, anyone trash like that should not be playing pvp
---
Oh, I‚Äôm not saying it isn‚Äôt bullshit. But it‚Äôs what works. It‚Äôs what got me to fabled this time around. Probably the only time I‚Äôll get to fabled. But it gave me a shot, and it‚Äôll give everyone else a shot.
---
#THIS IS AMAZING
---
WONDERFUL!!!
---
&gt;	Just wait until they actually make this ~~shit~~ **awesomeness**
---
FTFY
---
Leviathan is the first chronologically, but Eater of Worlds, the second, is easier. I think either of those is fine to start with. 
---
[I have a guide here on getting in to raiding.](https://old.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/c95ojp/a_guide_to_raiding_in_season_7_for_new_players/)
---
 *GET DOWN, MR. PRESIDENT!*
---
I don‚Äôt like using it and honestly usually use my sniper and smg but if I go up against a full team using it, you better believe I‚Äôm using that bad boy. My biggest problem is the availability of heavy to people who invade, it‚Äôs easy especially in 4 stacks to have the rest of the team leave the heavy on the wall for the invader so they are guaranteed heavy for every invade, especially with being able to equip heavy ammo finders
---
Hahahaha im sorry pal one of my Not so many Screenshots but i tried my best
---
I feel personally attacked
---
I don't mean to sound rude or condescending, but it's only 25 precision kills with hand cannons. Even a person with the worst aim imaginable can still get it done. Hell, when I did it I had a .5 kd. It took me like 15 games to get done, and that was with friends to teamshot/distract the enemies for me. I just kept at it, and I got it done
---
I wasn't around back then, which is why I'm asking the question.. Didn't know if they had a policy change, planned to make money in more ways with upcoming home switch, etc.
---
I could get on board with that.. maybe even have some sorta pvp against people who choose bad and those that choose good..
---
Yes, except for the fact that it has like no health bonus. I always got really pissed when nova warp was op af and I would try to thundercrash someone using it and they unleash an explosion right before you impact, thus killing you
---
Thanks for the info :)
---
They should implement a camo system for exotics similar to CoD
---
That's my go to setup. Great job!
---
Aight, I mostly main a titan, but used hunter to get recluse. I held on to a blade barrage, basically JUST to shut down any super (maybe use it to kill someone going crazy with Lord of Wolves). No matter the super, blad barrage could shut it down. Not to mention Shadowshot
---
Oh that sounds cool
---
Oh. Yeah, that does need a DR decrease while not blocking. Sorry
---
Which C.O.D.?
---
It‚Äôs just like duck hunt. Except the duck is a man literally too angry to die
---
Singing bday voices in the background starts fading away, camera gets closer and closer to my face as dead by the light
---
Or it could have been Baxlyy
---
Banner shield is unaffected by blade barrage
---
What about swords though? He could have done the same with a sword.
---
Give me the Lenz in Destiny and I‚Äôll die happy
---
Bo2/3 probably
---
I can only say, don't celebrate too early
---
Happens to me as well on XBOX. But instead, it completely signs me out of XBOX live as well. It's definitely my internet, but I can't figure out what. Our ISP says everything is fine, XBOX's network statistics are constantly telling me everything is okay, can't find the source of the issue. Very frustrating. I had to resort to an ethernet cable. My cats don't agree though, they like to constantly chew on every damn cord in my house so yeah, I'm in the same boat and out of ideas.
---
Name calling isn't nice yknow. Didn't mommy and daddy teach you that?
---
Thank you this is exactly what I was looking for
---
Only recently? People have been doing it since Forges release back in Season of the Forge. What's going on now is that it is becoming increasingly popular. The only main issue with it is people who do it at max Light who then ruin the experience of other players. If you lower your light, you get match with other players looking to do the same thing as you are meaning you aren't ruining any one person's gaming experience.
---
Nah not really, plus this cheese can be done afk meaning you don‚Äôt have to do anything!
---
I think like brave 2?
---
What NF did you run to get it?
---
It‚Äôs not that high
---
I doubt it
---
Key part in the destiny raid wrath of machine
---
Yeah but you get more if you maximize your time on patrol its not really its facts
---
Didn't mommy and daddy teach you that when someone insults you on the internet it means nothing? I like how you payed attention to that but not the contents of my comment.
---
More people are making videos on it, it‚Äôs get bungies attentions... plus the cheese is a mess, it‚Äôs honestly stupid!
---
It‚Äôs getting patched, end off!
---
I‚Äôve been using transversive steps recently, since that sprint speed boost is quite helpful in the neutral game. If you like blink, then astrocyte verse would also be nice to use.
---
Are those shops in the top right confirmed to be vex?
---
But people aren‚Äôt gonna run around for 3 hours on patrol
---
Yea everytime
---
It's like its 2015 again.
---
I get this cause its anine üòÇ
---
Have an orange arrow on me üëç
---
Lol. Honestly, buddy, my position was solidified in my first comment. All the rest of the stuff was just you rambling about being a whiney bitch. But like I said, your words...not mine.
---
Insults on the internet mean something to someone. People take their lives over shit people do and say to them on the internet
---
And where is are you getting your information about it "getting patched"? Searched on various sites (reddit, Bungie, previous TWABs) and can't find any source of information saying that they are either looking into it nor patching it.
---
Unless the boss freaks out and faces a wall or something random happens green room and Outbreak Prime is an easy one phase every time.
---
Everyone blows these exotic nerfs out of proportion. Just use them!
---
I just got catalyst
---
Put in the infinite forest and some stuff about simulations and we should be good
---
And if youre being an entitled dingus on the internet, you deserve to be called a dingus.
---
Outbreak is able to one phase this boss, as are the two exotic heavy snipers, rat king (if you are close), and heavy 150RPM grenade launchers (if you are close).
---
One eyed mask yes shoulder charge puffy you fault for letting a titan get that close
---
Then why speak of which you know nothing about.
---
I suspect you‚Äôre original comment was about titans in PvP. When people say titans are weak, they‚Äôre certainly not talking about PvP.
---
Bungo please.
---
Xur isn't showing up for me :(
---
Yeah, just hold it until it has clicked three times, then let go. Way higher damage than normal, so you're way more effective with limited ammo
---
I got 1k, tarrabah, and leviathan ghost first try
---
I have never personally used the green room strategy. What exactly makes it better?
---
Are you sure you are in the right spot?
---
name calling is childish yknow
---
There's so much wrong with this picture.
---
Why is the company just "Pokemon Go"
---
Why do the icons for the weapons get cut off or are just straight up hidden?
---
Why is that charmeleon so realistic yet so bad?
---
Who the hell plays Defender Titan in PvE?
---
I have a couple of friends that would.
---
ok what the heck are those?
---
More childish to be offended by it but ok
---
They‚Äôre probably buying it to complete their collections badge for wayfarer, not use them.
---
Thunder lord fully spun up does more then hammerhead with boss spec...
---
But then again HMGs are terrible for boss DPS, worse then specials
---
During tie breaker in gambit; blade barrage with Shards. As long as you don‚Äôt die, endless super. Melting point does help though.
---
How did you match up against my team
---
Sorry I thought I replied to this. DM me, we might be able to coordinate something. We'll go into more detail in DM.
---
"I'm a Hunter, so I must jump.
---
"No. Seriously. Imma jump-climb the shit out of the Last Wish treasure room."

---
Well thank you, unfortunately I've been trying for months lol
---
bungie on the left, activision on the right
---
I'm literally not even on that quest step yet though is the issue
---
I think it's the Edge Transit
---
I‚Äôve been waiting so long for this, my life is complete. Thank you
---
You‚Äôve already posted this.
---
I think u have to do the weekly Gambit prime bounties to upgrade ur synth
---
It‚Äôs double Valor next week
---
‚ÄòWhat am I doing? Oh yeah soloing Riven‚Äô
---
That arrogant sob
---
Mountaintop, Izanagis, Threat Level (with trench barrel), imperial decree (with trench barrel or Swashbuckler) or Arbalest if you hate shields
---
Lion rampants is better
---
Hoes mad^
---
People havent been banned for anything since S3
---
Go for it, the quest sucks ass
---
Waaaaaaaah, he called me a dingus.
---
You pretty much get a lore page every ignition now
