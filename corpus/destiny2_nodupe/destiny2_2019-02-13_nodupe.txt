the fuck is meme awards?

The Whisper of the Worm mission is probably one the best exotic quests in the game and I'm pretty confident you should have access to it. It's not easy to acquire, you will need a fireteam (can be done solo, just takes a lot of practice) but it's super fun I recommend looking up how to get it started.
---
And people ask why its bad to cluster. Because if bungie ever did fix it thats thousands of people who have not a clue wtf to do 
---
I love how Midnight Coup is still one of the top weapons, it really is D2’s Fatebringer
---
Honestly this is better.
---
Laugh at them 
---
Dude dont bother grinding to 300 is not worth it
---
It is much easier to increase your power level past 300 after you buy forsaken
---
From what I've seen, the only thing locked behind silver is an emote, the tiny bow. Everything else can either be earned via Shaxx or the engrams you get via levelling up
---
Figure of speech my dude
---
Players who do not at least own Warmind need to be 100% carried through Whisper. The enemies are power level 400, if I remember correctly, meaning you must be \*a bare minimum\* of 350 to deal damage at all. 
---
Every single Taken enemy is a more annoying version of their normal counterpart. Awesome design and super interesting lore but just fucking irritating to fight.
---
The difference is I'll admit i made a mistake even though I've used it in all my other comments correctly and unlike you I'm not going to edit it out so there is no proof that I made a mistake. Keep being toxic kid.
---
The new nova warp. 
---
don't complain about it, it's secretly a hard light side car &gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;
---
Maybe it's because your not good at it rather?
---
You are in luck, Crimson Days, the current one week long holiday event, has another high power level item you can get. Do Shaxx's Crimson Days bounties and save up hearts until you can get The Vow. 
---
Ah damn, I thought it was 280! You'd be right about the damage in that case. Apologies for the mislead there. If OP is on Xbox I'd be happy to help out though if needed.
---
The LFG discord for PC is full of poeple who say "LFG driven NO CHEESE". You ask em why and they get all offended
---
How many grenades did you throw? Did you count them?
---
I'm just looking for something to do until I get it, so I've been playing alot of crucible.
---
Since d1.... Day one!!
---
Ruby Rose's sparrow 
---
I got this exact roll with a range master work but I got pulse monitor instead of rampage :(... trying to use it more to see if it’s worth using more then dust rock or toil and trouble. 
---
And it's still going down
---
What I love about Monarque in forges is that I know that if I connect and get the poison debuff, I can just move on to fighting the next thing and know it's going to die.
---
Fucking weebs -- Also weebs
---
Quick google search says the split isn't far apart from general population, so the reason is "there are more hunters in the game overall"
---
How about taken?
---
I recommend doing the Heroic story mission through the Vanguard menu. You're guaranteed to be private and that has worked for everyone that I'm aware of.
---
Ty :)
---
When im on core d2 and 0 bow drops still. Getting this bow tomorrow, kind of excited. 
---
AFAIK, it’s like how the BA bow is just reskinned kinetic arcite. Except BA bow can roll perks and arcite is static. Does this weapon become a drop with random perks? Otherwise then yeah, double worthless because it’s even also an energy weapon.
---
Ancient apocalypse isn't bad with the right shader
---
Mf you look deidic
---
It’s really not that sweaty imo, I’m an above average PvP player but i havent struggled at all, if you’re playing with a friend and using meta stuff it’s not that bad imo, but your mileage may vary 
---
Evading for heavy, suppression super, blade barrage, 4 exotics that return super or elongate it
---
It’s not great.  Got my second tonight.  My buddy tho, he’s on run 135 and still hasn’t gotten yet.  Just trying to check that box.  
---
That’s why classes are currently being worked on to bring better balance. Balance, especially with the way this game is designed, is always a work in progress, because there’s a lot at play.
---

---
Maybe warlocks just don’t fit the way you like to play the way they are right now. I know that I have never been good with warlocks as they just aren’t my playstyle. But since the nova warp nerf I’ve seen a lot more varied warlock supers and they do well - it’s not like dawnblade is the only option if it’s variety you crave. 
---
Warlocks have about the same win rate and kd as the other classes so they are totally still viable. Not being flashy =/= underpowered 
---
That’s the OEM nerf: the perks stay exactly the same but you lose a teammate 
---
OH NOOO!!
---
Yare yare daze
---
It's got slightly lower base draw time and a draw time masterwork perk.  As well as archers tempo, this could end up being a very rapid - firing bow, that's the only reason I'm looking forward to getting it is because fast bows are lots of fun, for pve at least. 
---
Just try and do it in legend it’d be faster since there’s no loss streaks
---
[removed]
---
Hey OP, don’t you have to have 11 bounties completed for it? How’s you manage to get all 11 that quick when there’s only 5 total rn?
---
Pretty much: https://youtu.be/5CDgWm1EeuY
---
Also beware of earrape. 
---
The only new stuff is the bow and the chocolate ghost shell from D1.   You could count the exotic emote and bow ornament as well, but those cost silver.  Everything else is useless to someone who already got it last year
---
What are the perks? I don’t remember what the ghost perk icons are
---
I just nut and I don't even deserve nuts
---
Did it kick back and smack you in the pride? It will heal.
---
That's me...
---
A mask that not even a partner could love.
---
What a fat mood
---
Eva’s lore isn’t dropping for me anymore? I need 2 more. Also this is great, do you release this weekly? Big help
---
I've been matchmaking into so many half empty matches or 1 v 2. Please stop leaving matches constantly when you don't start well (obviously there are other reasons for matches to be empty or matchmaking to fail).
---
Probably not on here because a much lower % of the PVE population has those guns
---
Ahhh I see now...
---
TL;DW: Guy uses bow with dragonfly but not once gets a collateral with dragonfly. Somehow still decides to include "dragonfly" in the title. Dies pretty often.
---
I watched it so you don't have to, you are welcome. 
---
There are fables of them. Some lucky few are said to have happened upon these relics on their journeys 
---
They never really stated, in the TWAB it says it will be double Valor “throughout the event”
---
*Laughs in titan shotgun ape* 
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
I think it's the star crossed mark (the current eververse armor), idk
---
Eva's Journey lore has a chance to drop from any heroic story mission, always. If you have not gotten lately, it is because you are having some bad luck. 
---
If I was a dev I would stay as far away from this sub as humanly possible. These are not the type of players any game developer should listen to. 
---
Slide out last word. Easy kill. Peek game ace of spades. Easy kill.  The list goes on. I'll challenge that any day. And win.
---
Lucky. I can’t even get perfect paradox for some reason
---
Wait, are you gifting them? Cause if you are then thank you, they don't sell these anywhere I've been to, and also, can I get one?
---
Btw this dropped after I did Flashpoint 
---
ok?
---
Loot pool changes generally only happen at the end of one season and the start of the next one. 
---
The crucible and vanguard loot pools have been basically the same since Forsaken. No items have been removed, but a couple have been added when Season of the Forge started. 
---
I love whisper but lose the curser way too easy. Wish I could get a different scope. 
---
&gt;What if there's a third person that gets matched with us
---
Are you sure you did a story mission? No story missions have matchmaking. Some take place in open world areas where you might see other players, but that isn't the same as being matched with people. 
---
They have no relation to each other, other than they both  serve the Nine in some way.
---
Unless this is a meme post.
---
The reset where you stand against the wall to get ported for being outside of the instance is certainly questionable, but the onus is on bungie to fix this stuff. They know about it.
---
The fact that you need that many perk crutches to do the strat speaks volumes of the level of skill you have. Also, the strat still requires planning and takes advantage of the encounter, where everyone does enough damage in a damage frame that the encounter allows to just bypass the rest of the mechanics. I find it personally to be really cool that the community found a strat like this, and although I do wish I could do it 'legit', I dont make an ass out of myself like you do.
---
Destiny: “You must kill me. I cannot self terminate.”
---
New Game: *only wounds it’s playerbase but doesn’t kill it*
---
What made you think it deserves another post?  
---
Come on. This subreddit is already littered enough with such shitposts.  
---
87% of players have this exotic.   
---
  
---
It's the memory of cayde mark, A random legendary drop that you also get after completing forsaken 
---
I dont mind the Cabal.
---
My problem is with the Vex. Don’t get me wrong, I love the lore behind the Vex and theyre cool, but for some reason, those damn crit spots don’t register sometimes.
---
And you clearly dont even know how to cluster properly. If you can event cheat you way through it correctly you would never be able to do it legit.
---
I will go out of my way to never touch the person.
---
Bungie have patched other raids that have had glitches. They did not feel like it was a problem. I've seen you on this sub and I know you're just another toxic asshole. So seeya later.
---
is that a... cat ghost shell...?
---
The more you know again. 
---
Exactly.
---
In any case, if memory serves me correctly, Riven's side selection is random. In theory you could still run the cheese strat without the teleport by just repeatedly wiping until Riven went the "correct way."
---
so funny
---
You see, I don't need 8 or 9 rockets to get over 2 million damage on any of my character because k actually know how to optimize damage. Also funny of you to assume that but I also sherpa and teach people encounters, so I do in fact know how to do riven legit.
---
All my frames will be forged in Bergusia. Only reason for me to do any other forge is for a quest step or a bounty.
---
Oh word can you still get it randomly? I too havent played in awhile and missed it
---
Yeah, it's that. I'm a Hunter player, but I know Warlocks get an air dash. Look into it
---
Oh I know the one op is using I was  wondering about the one sardon is using 
---
And then next time you go to Mercury, your Ghost melts.
---
ye I need that one too. sad.
---
&gt;He brought me into this world, and he is the man who will take me out of it.
---
look I'll be honest, all I hear is complaining, remember back in D1 when all the warlocks tolf us Titans to "get good" when THEY were OP'd? yeah Karma sucks doesn't it
---
Shotgunners had a counter. Handheld supernova, in the nova warp subclass for wlock. This skill used to single handedly stop rushers in their path. Since Bungie has decided to completely gut Nova Warp in both pve and pvp, it's now a useless subclass. I get why Bungie had to nerf it for pvp but for what reason did they gut the pve duration? And for those of you who just want to tell me to run Dawnblade or Stormtrance for add clear, those subclasses don't have *Handheld Supernova*. So please Bungie, learn from your s2 pulse rifle mistakes and stop overnerfing things.
---
This is true, but it works to my advantage because I can use this week for PvP sniper training :D
---
Except for the part where I get a headshot at the apex of my jump and I'm so excited I forget Jötunn leaves a puddle of fiery death exactly where I'm about to land :C
---
Bite has a static roll
---
I'm tempted to run Suppression nades... freaking metaslaves running luna and DRB...
---
how to achieve gold 101
---
you kinda have to
---
as a hunter, i can confirm this statement
---
Is that Gambit chrome?  Is that just a luck drop from playing Gambit?  I feel like I have played enough Gambit to warrant more than the TWO gambit chrome shaders I've acquired...
---
The only thing you need bite to roll is mastwrwork  draw time. Every thing else is static but the masterwork.
---
Wait? Did I find a post that didn’t complain about OEM? I thought this was impossible!! Well done Guardian!! Well done!!
---
this is hilarious!
---
this, this is more pressing to me than the OEM debacle 
---
Why not do that?
---
Never played D1 and dont care about D1.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
D2 warlocks have never been op in the Neutral Game. Nova warp Was strong. and needed to be toned back, given.... it didnt need its knees smashed in with a baseball bat and left on the harbor to be eaten by the birds. But thats what we got. (like actually the super isnt even useful in PVE anymore)
---
I dont care if some warlocks told you to "get good" Cause I havent heard a single good argument on why OEM isnt OP and doesnt need a nerf. The literal only argument I've heard is "its the first exotic armor that feels exotic" Everyone else is just like "I want my free comp wins"
---
welp. then "get. good." there, now you've heard it from a Titan :)
---
now you kniw how sunbreakers felt in D1.
---
If thats what you want to call it....
---
It may not be a man. I’m a woman who plays D2 ya know....
---
It’s not my full bore, accurrized, opening shot, explosive payload, MW Range but not bad bro. 
---
And by Weapon Core I of course mean Enhancement Core!
---
I've seen none of that actually lol
---
He did reject his humanity.
---
So the discord isn't actually full of people asking for no cheese than
---
It's only been 10 and half hours
---
Yeah, well, you know, that's just, like, your opinion, man. 
---
It will operate like any other hand cannon it will just look like it. Doesn't that entice youM
---
Check r/fireteams . There may be someone looking for you there guardian. Best of luck!
---
It’s 650 tho....
---
THANK YOU, GUARDIAN!
---
Dreaming city recommended light ranges from 540 to 560, then 570 at Shattered Throne. 
---
The only stuff you have to be 600+ for is the post forsaken stuff, Black armoury, Jokers wild, and Penumbra. 
---
Just systematically do the dreaming city stuff on you’re own time. Don’t look at everything at once as you might feel overwhelmed.
---
Dreaming city gives the best gear at higher light than almost everything else so doing the weekly bounties from there is the best way to increase light.
---
NO EXCUSE. *TITAN SMASH*
---
“You look like you got what it takes” -Shaxx
---
**DON’T PLAY GAMBIT, GUARDIAN!**
---
**PLAY THE CRUCIBLE!**
---
There was no update AFAIK.
---
I'm 99% sure they could re-use the models, though they would probably re-texture them and do some other tweaking to bring them up to standard.
---
What shader is that...
---
His expression says.....
---
*insert voice cracks*
---
"I'm Trying. I really am."
---
Dude I feel ya, my heart nearly broke seeing that. I wish I could have jumped in with you. I'm not the greatest but I could have at least helped.
---
Warlock: You don't have a diver licence that why 
---
I think they should patch it so that it plays as intended. It just isn’t fun to cheese the boss when the mechanics are the best of any other raid boss. I will cheese it but that’s cause I’ve already done it normal. It’s a shame they haven’t fixed it by now.
---
The locations right next to fast travel spots are the busiest,  but if you haven't progressed the story very far, you won't have every fast travel point yet. 
---
What's an lfg?
---
Damnn 
---
Isn't it the Hangman heroic adventure right now anyway? 
---
Lord Shaxx has no boundaries. Might as well slit his throat to keep him from telling your secrets to  the madams.
---
i like grinding, it's just different now. i'm not gonna grind like 6 hours to try get something to drop for it to just be a double 🤷‍♂️
---
Scorn are the most annoying because they leave fire all over the place for you to die in
---
Using anything other than Threat Level, NoB, and whisper/sleeper/acruis OMEGALUL
---
i currently play D1 tho 
---
Just makes things all the more satisfying to get. I agree that grinding can get tedious, but to me there’s no better feeling than seeing that one item pop up on your screen after hours and hours of farming. It’s all apart of the experience.
---
A website for Looking for a Group (LFG).
---
People go on there when they need help in Raids and everyone can join. As I said try bungie.net
---
The tower is so pretty. Your hunter looks perfect there!
---
Wait... what. That's clever af. Time to dust the Rig off.
---
*laughs in fucking killing them*
---
I... uhh... do I remove th... no...
---
Jesus christ.
---
Apex's ping system is delightful.
---
They're at -96 as I type this. Damn, that's an impressive amount of salty bitterness over a PvE strategy that no one forces anyone to use. 
---
What stuff? Theirs only a bow and a bunch of ghost and a couple of sparrows. This event is a huge disappointment. 
---
Maybe with a little butt hugging too? Nothing gay... just showing fellow titans the appreciation... maybe some wrestling...
---
Thanks for the bow Shaxx! It's nice 
---
Why do people say two stack as if that’s not the entire point of the mode?
---
What he said. I was in the same position and it was in my collection 😊
---
 Crimson days is a very minor event. Would've been nice for new stuff, but it is low on the priority list.
---
that a fireteam ?
---
And he left the helmet on
---
Nothing compares to it. The nerf literally didn’t affect it. Do your own research before believing other people’s bitching.
---
I am a bow enthusiast, I love them. Bows can be good, if you pair it with something like lucky pants and a 140/180 hand cannon. If you have annual pass, I'd highly recommend trying the vow with the last word.
---
Although, bows are not in a very good spot at the moment. 
---
I'm pretty sure that each subsequent round actually goes up in power level being 625 at boss wave so you are actually under leveled as well.
---
imo, the point is to have fun with your friend, spamming grenades and melee abilities.
---
To be fair I completely understand this point of view.But the reason I do hate it is due to the fact that you shouldn't always get people higher up to  help you.Mostly due to the fact that's just how I grew up.But I do perfectly understand your point 0f view
---
What if we use thunderlords?
---
I am not much of fan Spring too, beautiful and all but I sneeze my brains out whole damn season lols
---
Not deployed yet. Coming in the season 6 patch i think.
---
I literally have a 650, ready to equip - didn't even register to equip it! FFS, sorry to have failed you.
---
Doing it cheesed isnt done to have fun so telling people to let others have fun doesnt apply here. And if most people would not know how to do Riven legit, then fucking learn it. Its such an easy fight once you do it a couple times. This community is just a bunch of lazy people who try to speed run everything and thats the biggest thing that annoys me. D2 has turned into GDQ simulator for all the content. And as I said, Riven is not hard to learm. The prerequisites for the fight are this
---
- Know left from right
---
- Be able to count up to 5 (6+ not needed)
---
- Shoot a stationary target
---
Most people in the fight literally just have to shoot ads and a single eye which is where the left/right 1-5 come in. How is having one thing to shoot a single bullet at hard? Beats me but everybody seems to act like its rocket science.
---
And as for Heart being cooler to you, to each his own but I just dont see how running a ball down a hallway is cooler than fighting a giant dragon that is breathing fire at you, slamming you with tentacles, and twirling around a giant eggs with you floating down a room and shooting axion darts at you as her big Ahamkar extremities crush you in a claustrophobic daze. Not to mention the parts you do even with the cheese which is platforming in the ascendant plane and literally running inside her as she sprays her magic everywhere as she dies and bleeds from her mutilated eyes. Plus heart being better or worse is irrelevent to people cheesing.
---
You can cancel the animation on some guns and fire rñway earlier, machine guns or shotties for example. I only feel that problem when using SMGs and aome autorifles

**AS MANY OF YOU SUGGESTED; HERE IS CURRENT PVP META:** [LINK TO REDDIT](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/aq4ny3/as_many_of_you_suggested_here_is_current_crucible/)

They just changed it so using 3rd party macro software gives the same acceleration as binding jump to scroll wheel in-game.
---
Don't forget that love is a battlefield.
---
Is socks? Sacks? Sicks? Get a mic, make some friends, don't play an online, multiplayer, group play enabled game, and then demand that it cater to single players.
---
This is how my wife and I game. Side-by-side, in our little 2 person clan. It's great fun.
---
He'll play with your bits if you don't keep an eye on your six.
---
You do realise that this game is made for group play, right? It's why clans are a thing. If you don't like that, then don't play Destiny.
---
Here you go Guardian: [LINK TO PVP META LIST](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/aq4ny3/as_many_of_you_suggested_here_is_current_crucible/)
---
The no 8 spot seems horrifically inaccurate ad tlw is a pvp gun. 
---
so warlocks are the support class?
---
Lol I got two one after the other so it was like a match made in heaven XD
---
how do you use them in pvp?
---
Never used it myself, always been a fan of Go Figure/Bygones - but hell yeah, Chaperone is a cannon!
---
It's a meme that warlocks have the highest skill gap because they are the most underpowered class of the three. Hunters have everlasting OP supers, titans have shoulder charging (which is one hit KO and annoying as fuck in PvP). The abilities of the warlock is more fitted towards PvE and *tactical gameplay*, which is not exactly the average Destiny players' strong suit.
---
Wow, that is pretty lucky tho! :D Nice one Guardian.
---
But why use a weapon designed for pvp in pve? 
---
Super awesome! Havent seen  a consept that cool never i think.
---
BIG UP!
---
And yeah, first image on my mind was the Nazerics sin helmet.
---
Gambit and breakneck were really bad for this but I still see ppl just doing it in the crucible even had someone doing it in a blind well
---
i feel like this only happens on console
---
Now if only I could get a random that somehow managed to learn not to run head first Into the enemy the moment he respawns after...... idk maybe the 6th game would be fair (apparently no other solo players were queuing at the time)
---
What cloak you mean big visible purple mode
---
*-Awesomezauce plays the trombone*
---
it’s not though
---
That makes sense
---
If bungie doesen't bother to fix the issue I take that as a sign that it is supposed to be done that way.
---
#rivenclusterislegit
---
Doesn't the chat indicate that this is on PC?
---
Jesus how pretentious can you get bro? Calm down 
---
I never said rainbows the colors inside of rivens heart are metallic rainbow colors hence why it is called the rainbow room. And the asendant plane comment was just me over exaggerating the art style inside of rivens heart because you over exaggerating how cool the boss fight is. Not caring? They have changed raids in the past like vog due to glitches and cheeses. They addressed how the encounter was being completed and they did not have a problem with it.
---
Cool! Didn’t know the bounties added up so that’s nice to know. Thanks!
---
Not really pal it’s just a game 
---
Actually we did solve division by 0 for quite some time and there is no mistery left there. The answer is that it's undefined, because if you start messing around with it, you might get a 0=1 statement. And yeah, I usually kill at parties
---
Two good players can definitely win with a variety of weapons! I agree it’s been a lot of fun so far. Complementing playstyles is the best if you’re trying to win every match, one guy w sniper HC and another w pulse rifle and shotty 
---
If they cared they would change it...and Ive never heard it called rainbow room before. Ive only heard Heart. Ive never even noticed rainbow colors in there. The heart inside is a redish color. Thats some weird blood rainbows you got wherever you live.
---
I’m mad because you spelt it “loosed” instead of “lost”
---
Both EU and NA
---
"Cabal on the field" NOOOOO!!!!!
---
wait, is this a solo queuer complaining about  other solo queuers?
---
Also this is the only Solar bow no?
---
Also does it mean that Shaxx can drop another rolls for it if I buy the engram?
---
If yes then I gonna grind for explosive head
---
I'm a dude who uses a female hunter because I like looking at her ass. Should I get therapy?
---
Which also resets and initiates as a full heal out of a melee kill or from consuming a grenade
---
Or a balanced version of OEM 
---
She is trying to get the perfect 360 noscope for her montage 
---
I don't mind LFG, generally not too bad in most cases (bar the occassional "oh I've done it 20 times, but whats a Riven?"). But problems of Clans, if you have an event/raid and take LFG randoms over clanmates, someone will kick off the complaining
---
I think it is. I keep getting the same voice line of like "How? There's four of you!"
---
Your next line is!!
---
Seriously. I used to try to get my mom to play Mario kart with me on n64 
---
I’m so proud of this community 
---
Nah, just making a blueberry joke.
---
HA! My babe is the random I match with 😎
---
“There’s four of you, and you all have guns!!”
---
Gambit is my main gameplay and I’ve gotten maybe 1-2 exotics from it, nice haul though!
---
I know. But wanted to try and do it myself, or I got asked by someone to help with. :) 
---
It was honestly so weird to see every single person on the tower just gathered around in one place lol, didn’t think everyone would get involved eventually 
---
Trials are gone, yeah. 
---
*randomly throws a grenade and i see 6 damage numbers*

"marked for vengeance x6"

*go back to orbit*
---
Destiny is a very grindy game. If you want a lot of story and lore, you’ll have to dig through and collect a ton of lore books. If you want pvp, we have it tenfold. But you’re gonna need to grind out for some good roles for perks on the weapons you use. Until you get to the endgame, it’s pretty boring and easy to get lost and quit the game. But if you make it there, it’s a pretty fun game. Regardless of the amount of problems with it.
---
Lol, ive seen this image many times before and I always laugh at it when I see it.  The only description for that poor dogs expression is ABORT MISSION!!!!!!!
---
If this were a movie this scene would be the part where everything freezes and the main character takes you back in time to explain how he ended up in said situation lol
---
Wow there is actually a redditor with that username xD (it's my instagram mane)
---
Because those are so big..... are they gonna be better? 🤔
---
I want .. no I need! Game I can grind. World of Warcraft is complete shit so I am searching for game I can sink thousands of hours into and I think Destiny is the right call (or Anthem honestly, idk how good that will be)
---
Numbers are the best way. I don’t even play pc, but it’s definitely the way I’d play
---
I got DFA, The Vow, and a forge weapon 
---
Yes, but it's for playing a Hunter
---
I’m gonna try that armor with Blueshift Dreams and see if it looks similar
---
They way he fell of is hilarious, but was this recorded on a potato? 👀

So, use a hand cannon?

I’m not surprised the Warlock is writing Awoken Corsair x Cursed Thrall fanfics

can I still be a titan daddie if my character is a stupid thicc awoken chick?

I know, we couldn't stop laughing - the fact that he turned and was looking at me as he fell was priceless!

It’s filthy. :P

Nah i have the necessary brain cells required not to use a pulse rifle

"Love approaching. Bring a condom!"

I think I was 644 the first time I finished it.

In general I agree, but I love the forge helmet.

I feel personally attacked

but its good :(
---
Titans. We are the sexiest...
---
I would say there are some ok exceptions
---
Sadly I never will be able to get this reference. 
---
Trials and faction rallies were removed to be reworked due to bad player feedback. We have no idea when they'll be back. 
---
Ik lol. I’ve already played against it and I hate it 
---
STL, OBJ, X3D or other file types work, thanks!
---
Well it wasn’t meant to be, just sayin being on the other end if that thing is rage inducing
---
Why didn't they call it the "Chocolately" shell? 
---
Wow, well shit.  In that case...   Yeah - what a worthless bow (unless you need it for the 650 boost like Horror Story). 
---
Endgame content is still unraveling.
---
Curated nation of beasts 
---
It's a black armoury mod so you have a shot at getting it when you buy one from ada1
---
No
---
Patching a current raid and changing future ones are not the same thing. You took both of those statements out of context to try and call me stupid. Its faster doing cluster bombs than it is normally. I know you're super good at the game but ultimately people doing cluster does not affect you at all. You are trying to make up reasons for this to be cheating even though bungie said it's not. Since you took my words out of context to help you I'm done responding.
---
My format hehe &gt;:D

Well they did show a Thorn-oid thing in the Last Word trailer... Sadly Malfeasance already has the supercombine ability... Maybe apply a special debuff of some kind on e enough needles have been stacked?
---
It still only caps out at 2, unfortunately.
---
Well he says "take it or leave it" so it would imply at least that we have a choice in the matter lol
---
Same thing happened a few years back when I first got my computer. Jumped from gold in comp (overwatch) to diamond. Feelsgood 
---
Maybe a gun that if you stack the entire magazine, and only the entire magazine, you can get a single shot that suppresses your enemies from using supers or abilities. Like a plasma pistol
---
We cleaned the laptop, and it fixed the problem, could have been overheating

*5 open spaces 
---
That'd be pretty cool man
---
i mean technically thats how guardians find their "mates" in the lore so....
---
Yes. Those are from last year. The only **new** things are the tiny bow emote, the bow itself, and the bow ornament. The bow can be earned. The new emote and ornaments are only available for purchase. 
---
I'm talking about from range. If I'm exposed fighting another guardian and someone tries to hit me with a hand cannon from a distance they can't. A pulse rifle might tickle me but I have time to react and get to cover. A sniper or a scout? Well good for them if they put me down at least they have to aim. With jotunn all they have to do is point it in my general direction and they get a free kill. And it's not as "easy to dodge" as some of the liars in this thread are trying to claim either. In regards to Lunas Howl you still have to hit 2 precision shots in a row or the TTK is comparable to other 180 RPM hand cannons. Lunas Howl takes skill. Takes skill to acquire and skill to use. Jotunn takes no skill. It needs a fucking nerf. 
---
This morning i had this guy even being an asshole about it . At the start of a round he just burned his super and sat down with the table emote. The whole team stopped in its track and looked at him like wtf?? . We shot at him and he did a dance and then just fucked off. We where matching a 4 stack but they where not even beating us that hard. I was starting to get some kills going and i had my super coming up and we could have easily turned it around. Fucking looser mentality. 
---
I don't think i should loose points when this happens . I get that ranking should be hard but that a random looser can screw me over like this is just bullshit. It becomes just one bit too much of a lottery. 
---
Yes, you can earn everything from last year through engrams and Shaxx. But read my post again. The only **new** things are the tiny bow emote, the bow itself, and the bow ornament. The bow can be earned. The new emote and ornaments are only available for purchase. 
---
Cringeasaurus Shaxx
---
What gun i that
---
Nope not OC. 
---
Yup, Polaris Lance + hammerhead + Nova bomb with skull of dire ahamkara (warlock) works great
---
yup, constant scrims and sweats just proper grinding
---
I see dozens of Quick Access Slings in your future.
---
Alright Mavericks, let's see what she's got!
---
The holy shot is when they killed Cayde’s ghost
---
There don’t seem to be any errors but I will try that. Thanks 
---
Dragonfly mods aren't useless. Not at all. Running dragonfly with the dragonfly mod at one end of a choke point damages multiple enemies at the other end Down your sights. I've gotten doubles pretty consistently and sometimes triples like that. Let alone how useful it is in pve. If modded dragonfly is useless to you, you aren't using it right.
---
The fucking Grim Reaper or whatever the incendiary rocket launcher from like Black Ops 1. 
---
Too bad Tediore didn't make the Thunderlord.
---
The lantern is the criteria spot.
---
Then you just suck.
---
I’d recommend getting only one a day since the cost tripled 
---
Is there a chat feature for console too or is it just for PC?
---
PC players opinions are worth 50% less as non-PC players.
---
Oh you are bad ;P
---
No that helps haha. My computer sometimes has weird quirks like that too, that just don’t make much sense. Will try thanks 
---
I find it really distracting. Even After 10 full clears and a bunch of Riven cheeses. Its the same for Queen's run.
---
Oh so even worse, they just used old shit. lol
---
Love me my Dunemarchers. Friend of mine plays Hunter and when he starts talking shit about me not being able to catch up during a NF or w/e I'll switch to it. Apparently your footsteps sound like a charging elephant with them equipped lol.
---
"Keep the helmet on, young Midoriya"
---
yup if people are low level..     especially Volundr if you get matched with people who never ran the Forges.    I was leveling up my Titan and unlocking the Forges for the first time as I never got around to it on my alts.     I was doing my first run on Volundr as a 640 Titan.   I got matched up with 2 people both were about 590 to 600 power level.     We failed to kill the boss in the time limit as I seemed to be the only one doing enough DPS.
---
Nation of beasts is pretty spicy
---
Can you keep the helmet on?
---
Thanks man. I'll no life the hell out of Comp &amp; try &amp; get it done in this season only.
---
Transmat firing!
---
Now also have it pop up in the middle of your very first Whisper run then you have some fun
---
They been changing a lot now since the new dlc has come out. But they really need to spice up iron banner. 
---
And sorry i thought you said what instead of when lol.

You can look at this site for any changes they made or upcoming ones they'll do. 
---
Yo guardian hit up /r/fireteams
---
Plenty of people on your position 
---
Technically Blast Furnace and Go Figure are very similar guns. Blast furnace has longer range where as Go Figure has faster reload speed and handling. (According to light.gg)
---
Thank you!
---
You sound like you’re good enough for the rank just watch out because after 4000 it’s all streamers and paid carries
---
Especially when it randomly becomes heroic.
---
FYI no matter your light level Whisper will also drop at the end at 360 (i think?) It was around there for me anyways and I finally did the quest at around 630LL
---
Alright alright alright.. let’s see what we got?...............
---
I'd join in a heartbeat. 
---
thanks
---
It needs a nerf because it's overpowered. It's a rocket launcher that takes special ammo. It takes no skill to point and shoot a rocket launcher. Stfu. 
---
Ha that's a funny joke!
---
You mean why destiny 2 in general is a mess lol haha. 
---
PLAY CRUCIBLE GUARDIAN!
---
Run the xol nightfall with arc, more heavy ammo drop perk, and the no mini map mods with your heavy being thunder lord if you have it, in like 10 minutes you'll complete it. That's what me and some guy I matched up with in the lfg discord did, in 30 min we did it on all 3 characters.
---
I started when it was free as well and had a blast but the end game content for the free version quickly became boring for me. I purchased the DLC because I heard that the story alone was worth it (and boy was it!) and that end-game kept me busy for quite some time. I'm a game hopper and quickly bored or quick to switch to games my game-hopping friends switch to. But D2's expansions end game kept me busy for far longer than the endgame content you are currently still enjoying so I think it's safe to say the 60 bucks would be a safe purchase for you with tons of fun. 
---
Side-note, the clan finder app from what I've heard works like a charm, or if you want the d2 clan/grouping subreddits seem pretty active so I doibt you'd have trouble finding one. 
---
If you are considering buying it you'd better do it sooner rather than later because grinding to 300 is a real waste if you jump to 500 in the 2 days of starting the new content.
---
My 2 cents.
---
&gt;In one game you were the ONLY leaver so that’s on you (denoted with DNF) and in the other you are one of two leavers.
---
***As I have already said*** the game where I was the only leaver, we were getting crushed. ***We had already lost, 80-30.*** You don't get to dictate whether I get to leave a match that we had already lost. If you can't see the difference then I dunno, talking to a block of marble.
---
The other match I left after the other player, ***we had already lost.*** In case you can't tell, I am not good enough to 3v4 a good team with rubbish players. Again, if you can't see the difference between that and the guy who left ***first*** then I am talking to a block of marble.
---
Check my history, they are the only 2 matches I have left in a long time. I left those matches put of shear stress because (and I will detail the situation for a 3rd time just for you) ***We had already lost or we were down players and were losing.***
---
&gt;Also don’t flatter yourself, you have included your own info in your own posts so it took less than 10 seconds to verify your story and find my proof so maybe don’t include your personal info in your posts so people can’t fact check and prove you wrong. It’s just sad.
---
I did not have any of my personal info in this post. You are stalking me. In fact, there is only one post in my entire history that has my GT. And we both know it.
---
&gt;unless you keep up your current trend
---
I didn't realise leaving 2 matches in, um, several months is classed as a trend?
---
Dude, you are seriously going out your way to try stamp on me. It's pathetic, get a life and go stalk someone else. Go and take someone elses data out of context and try make it sound bad.
---
I find it quite crazy that you chose to focus on trying to make me sound like a hypocrite instead of seeing the real issue at hand. What are you trying to achieve exactly?
---
In other languages is call chaos just saying.
---
Lmaoooooooo
---
I don't understand, I thought all they did was make it damage you if you were to close, am I wrong?
---
They already missed their chance since Wavesplitter on PS4 means there are 117 exotics in Destiny 2.
---
Cheers for your thoughts. Yeah as pointed out, grind to 300 would be diminished with expac :D
---
Scratchy boi, scratcher of all scratchers

I just got Jötunn last night. I paired it with my Blast Furnace/Bad Omens. RIP shotty rushers - Jötunn when they don’t have angles on me just shuts them down. 
---
Are you using proximity grenades perhaps? Since Update 2.1.4:
---
Proximity Grenades can no longer impact directly (prevents Special ammo Grenade Launchers from one-shotting with the perk active)
---
Thank you so much 
---
Or: if you carry a lot of motes in a game with a queenbreaker on the other team, learn to accept your fate when they arrive
---
Ah thanks I didn't noticed the launcher already had 2 in the mag. I thought it was reloaded by killing the turret with ambitious assassin.
---
I mean...shouldn't the gun be Destiny, person be your grades, and the selfie stick be you?
---
Try harder Guardian!
---
I remember when warmind came out and when you pressed start the OST intro would just destroy your speakers
---
&gt;You can’t really say they shouldn’t be matched with you when you aren’t really at a high glory rank and you can easily get some wins with a team even with a 0.6 kd.
---
I started my glory grind at the beginning of the week. I think getting to 1300 in 3 days is actually pretty good. So tbh I don't feel like I should be paired with people who feed the enemy team 10 kills for every point they score. Those players shouldn't be in comp.
---
So many, but my lastest from last night: don't scrap the gifts you get in the dreaming city. They actually have a use.
---
If anyone reaches the boss, the other player(s) who die cannot get back in, so try to get the surviving person inside to wait patiently on the donut platform right above the boss arena! 
---
Lmao. The sheer amount of people trying to rush you with a shotgun. 
---
This breaks so many rules, plus I dont give a fuck.
---
Yea, as it stands it's somewhat useful in PVE if you get used to popping it before you need it, but it's pretty much completely useless in PVP.
---
Oh I’ll check it out. Pardon me my inner noob, as I have not been even a casual player for quiet some time. Might have misunderstood something! I’ll update on my progress and if i’m mistaken!) thanks for the point tho!)
---
YEAH NO FUCK PEWDIEPUE HES OVER RATED AND GARBAGE 
---
Class- Warlock Attunement of Control (Chaos Reach) 
---
Exotic Armor- Transversive Steps
---
Weapons
---
Kinetic- Atalanta D Proto Kill Clip/Zen Moment. MW Range. Minor spec. 
---
Energy- Anonymous Autumn Rampge/Full Auto. MW Stability. Rampage Spec Mod. 
---
Heavy- Tractor Cannon with Catalyst complete. 
---
Everytime I get home from work
---
Fair point. I still think it's better to talk shit about people behind their back (When you aren't ever going to see them again) then to their face though.
---
Yeah definitely, it would show what super is available to chose. 
---
The reason I said disable armor perks is because some a super exclusive and might accidentally empower other supers (ex shards and geomags)
---
Yeah but since I already had everything knocked out from last year there was even less. They could have at least made a lot more content for the vets. The engrams are pretty much just free bright dust. They said they where working on new emotes but literally the only new one is lock behind silver. 
---
Every time you leave an area, or fast travel, you create a new instance and move servers.  It is just crap luck that you are reinstancing on a dead server.  However, if you wait a few minutes instead of going to orbit, you will probably get some company.  If there are more than 5 people alread at a specific location the game will not load someone else in to that instance (unless you are joining someone's fireteam who is already there).  You will get moved to another instance.  It allows people already in an instance to have friends join them.  
---
We realized this when EP first came out and trying to get 2-3 people to instance at the same time to get a large enough group on the server to do the event.
---
Never noticed how much the cabal look like seals. 
---
WHAT ARE THOOOOOOOSE!?!?!
---
Why would you need randoms there in the first place?
---
Bring your Thunderlord (assuming you have one).
---
As soon as the boss wanders down from the platform he spawns on to the lower level you can toss up your barricade and dump a much power ammo into his face as you can. If your Super is up as well, you're done.
---
Doesn't really matter what the blueberries do.
---
Wait fr?
---
What system is this on?? Textures look great.  I’m on one x and it doesn’t look this good /:
---
If you're good with a bow then it's pretty nice. Other than that you'd be better off dismantling it.
---
That's the point, it's meant for that big burst of damage. I dont see a problem with waiting a couple seconds to get insane damage
---
but asking questions about the game are not ok....quality content here.
---
I also have the curated twilight oath role, haven’t really tried it out much so I definitely will
---
Thank you for clarifying! I’m new to the game, Activision , and Bungie so I appreciate pricate the info.
---
You tell em!
---
Titans get suppression as a *grenade* with a significantly faster charge time than a super, and with exotics they get two of them. 
---
If you're on ps4 add me
---
Way to rek him with EVIDENCE! Made my day.
---
Thats the trials of the nine armor set
---
Oh yeah I didn't even think of that. Thanks.
---
Question, why is breakneck top right? 
---
Numbers are better
---
I’m disappointed by your grammar.
---
Don’t forget your year 1 raid gauntlets. 
---
The perk to get heavy on melee kills still works and remains very useful in the Leviathan raids. 
---
Given that Activision dropped Bungie because they weren't happy with how Bungie was monitizing Destiny 2, I think it's good news; take a look at how they (Activision) just treated their own company.
---
Destiny 2 has its flaws, but having Bungie solely at the helm is a good thing.
---
The point is; It's not supposed to have high **dps** in the first place, because it's designed for **burst**.
---
Giving it higher damage would at some point just render weapons like darci (which are designed for dps, not burst) pointless.
---
Does it say heroic story mission. That would mean you have to do it through the vanguard page. 
---
Others on maps are either normal story missions and not heroic or adventures. 
---
There’s no matchmaking in the heroic story mission playlist. 
---
I know, but its how they said slightly tweak. They wont 'slightly tweak' it, theyll destroy it
---
Just curious, was this traced from this image?
---

---
It's the mission for the wish enter bow 
---
It’s the mission to progress the wishender quest 
---
We’ll just have to wait and see
---
It made me hate crucible so much
---
Wishender quest if I'm not wrong. Linked to Shattered Throne.
---
I wish this was the first time this shit gets posted here
---
So true, I'm scrolling destiny reddit when I have a midterm in an hour that of course I didn't study for because I was getting the vow 
---
SO and I got this together, I actually love this bow! 
---
Jealous of that secret victories emblem. Last thing I need to fill out my Forsaken destinations badge. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/apgu1l/too_true/?st=JS3QEX4X&amp;sh=0f2875c4

That’s what I had to do.  Either find a way to kill yourself to reload the point or start over
---
It’s happened to a lot 
---
What set is Saint-14s?? 
---
WHAT
---
Yes and that's the plan because am not too good at crucible.
---
Getting to the boss room with 8 minutes should be enough time. While you don't have to take out blights, bosses will hide in/behind them. I usually take out the front 2 blights, then loop around the cave on the right and take out the mid-right blight. When 2-manning it, my buddy and I got good at knowing when our supers would be ready and coordinating when we'd use them (throughout the whole run), and would make sure to have one to clear the adds as soon as the 3 blights were taken out, allowing you to spawn the bosses pretty quickly after getting to that room.
---
Once the bosses spawn, back up to where you dropped down into the room as a safe spot, and unload heavy ammo (I like using Sleeper), focusing on the captain since he continuously throws those blight ball things at you. Once heavy ammo gone, swap your power weapon to legendary and equip Polaris Lance and just pick off the other 2 bosses from afar, only running out to them when you have a super to use.
---
This reply made me laugh and I don’t know why. Well done 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
---
To be honest i did not even know about the secret achievments. So good looking out
---
To be honest i had no idea about the secret triumphs so good looking out
---
Ive been using a fusion rifle. Ive seen mountain top a few times, too.
---
Gotta pick up the emblem. If you have it in your inventory delete it then pick it up from shaxx. The bounties will appear when it’s accepted.
---
Those are GIGANTIC blueberries wtf.
---
Jesus. How.
---
You're only "that guy" when you start shitting on other people for playing their own way.  You and your clan are welcome to play however you wish.
---
Yeah, as @CMD\_Neopolitan said.  You can keep killing the heroic adventure boss until an armor piece drops.  Every class has a legendary helmet and chest piece.
---
I agree.  I see why you'd say that.
---
Sorry for being a day late, but I disagree with your thought process. 
---
This same argument comes up in subs like r/nostupidquestions and a bunch like it. Why can’t people just google it instead of making a thread for it? The best thing about reddit is the conversations you can have in threads. It is a forum website pretty much anyway. So why not allow people to have conversations? 
---
Regarding quest guides... yeah, I can read an article about it on Eurogamer. Yeah, I can watch a video for it on YouTube... but I would rather have it be a thread in a mega thread or it’s own post, because there, I can ask many questions and be answered. Different people can give various input, in regards “I play this class and this subclass, with this setup and it worked best for me”, but there can be a million different answers. Compare that to an article or video, where you spend a lot of time sifting through a ton of different crap just to find a class/subclass/loadout/play style that fits you.
---
didn’t meet him over d2, but my boyfriend got me into it and now we both kinda onsess over it
---
Thanks again! Almost there, but not too worried if I don’t get it.
---
I agree.   As stated, I'm pretty sure Bungie is using this as an opportunity to bring all of the year 1 content forward before year 3 drops.   This would be a perfect opportunity to do that and to a put the nail in Calus's coffin for good.  I'm hoping that all of the raid lairs get updated as well because I don't see how it'd make sense for them not to.
