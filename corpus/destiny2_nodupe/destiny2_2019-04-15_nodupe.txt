At least I can escape into cover if it's a Hammerhead. Wardcliff Coil just kills me no matter what I do

My friend and I got our Thorn last night. Mine was 665 Light.
---
Thank you for the tips. See you starside.
---
Thank you and to you as well.
---
There was a cutscenes a while back that you got, iirc, from doing the Offering in the Dreaming City for that week. It showed a Ghost flying around and finally resurrecting someone under a sheet, who quickly sits up and is revealed to be Uldren. 
---

---
Outside of that cutscenes (that was only available for like a week) nothing else has been said about it.
---
When you visit Mara Sov's throne on the left there is a display that normally shows Darkness ships. One week it showed a building. When you inspected it it showed Pulled Pork scanning a body under a flag. 
---
Pulled Pork rezzed the body, the flag falls away and we see it was Uldran Sov. As far as I know there hasn't been anything else in game to hint at him being a Light Bearer now. 
---
I'm also ok with Uldran being the new Hunter Vanguard. I feel Cayde-6 would have wanted it this way and would have laughed about it for days.

Once your done, if you want more content and end game activities, try to buy the annual pass for 30 bucks

Yeah I saw a guy comment once that Comp was cancer and you have to go back to Quickplay to actually have fun again. At least he's having fun, right?

But Thalnoc came after Vex Fanatics, as VoG came before TTK.

"I am the crucible" ~Lord Shaxx
---
And here I was thinking people on this subreddit weren't usually toxic.
---
It's not always bad. Most days, my internet's fine, and I can play just as good as if I were on gigabit. Some days, it's hot garbage, and something this extreme happens maybe 9/10 games on a bad day.
---
I'm not going to stop playing crucible, and im definately not the only one with this issue, so a simple fix would be a big improvement to crucible overall.
---
*Jabba the Hunt laugh here*
---
Wholesomeness overload right here.
---
I got a 10 kill streak because of BB the other day, which apparently my highest streak in D2 PvP.
---
Possibly
---
OEM is only good in PVP. it's virtually useless in PVE. HFH has great usefulness in PVE, and moderate usefulness in PVP. therefore, HFH outranks OEM in terms of universal usefulness.
---
And so am I.
---
(Avoidance of all Crucible activity Intensifies)
---
Oh it’s a good weapon. I had mine drop random in Gambit? I think.
---
Yeah, I'm not a warlock, but seems like nova war's charge time is too long to deal two attacks to another super in time. It doesn't seem like it's very good against other supers, but maybe I just haven't faced a master of it yet.
---
last thing you see before getting pummeled to death

Why must he sell items I already own!! 🙄

Are you drawing these? I've been seeing this take on the drifter around the net but can't find original creator. Props if its you!
---
Peoples games are definitely ruined, you can’t tell you are lagging due to p2p connection but when I meet people like you, it s a laggy mess and completely unfair. Not being toxic bud but YOU are the problem. Not the game

The closest I get to pretending that I'm a titan is liar's handshake with top tree arcstrider.

It one shotted my full masterwork arcstaff super, and tonight one warp took out my entire comp team.

Go figure. That thing is my baby

I’ve had no luck getting that weapon yet, no enemies or banshee want to give it to me

Good luck :)

Underrated comment.
---
No, unfortunately not. 3 infamy resets.
---
I just finished my first, now I gotta power through for that Dredgen title.
---
When you loaded your Thunderlord.
---
I like the idea behind the concept. It's a really neat idea, that riffs on rampage and kill clip, while feeling refreshing, but I feel like the perk reaches too far. This thing would become a laser beam of a hand cannon, and the magazine increase is far too generous. Granted the perk isnt super flashy, but it would be very difficult to challenge in a fight. 
---
But I really like the idea of the perk. I might change it so that on hit, Fantasia increases Stability, Handling, and Aim Assist by 3 for 3 seconds, stacks up to 5 times. 
---
The idea here is to reward accuracy with more accuracy, in a sort of trance like state. The edge of the screen could turn a swirly purple tinge to reflect that.
---
I will admit, I dont like Muse. ADS, is already a soft increase in accuracy, and I dont get the relationship with the name and the effect. I might change it to, Muse: On a kill, grants Truesight while ADS for 5 seconds. 
---
Playing off Fantasia, Muse is more actively involved with the user. It's guiding them to their next kill, and rewards streaks. The user still only has 10 rounds, and so playing smart counts. You cant just throw rounds away, but the rewards turn you into a beast. 
---
I do really like the original concept though, and I hope these ideas dont step on it too much.
---
I think like 6
---
Like I said, my post was an oversimplification, and the meta has only superficial similarities with the HoW meta. I agree, most weapons are way more viable in this meta than people give it credit for, I've found success with loadouts like Halfdan+Coldheart, Duke+Le Monarque, and even double Sidearm builds with Mechaneer Tricksleeves (Rat King+Last Dance).
---
I just thought that it's funny how much they're similar, even if only on a superficial level

Intrinsic Perk:

Jotunn Business: Fires Jotunn shots with the same firing speed of Sweet Business. Anybody killed by it in the Crucible gets their game automatically uninstalled.

OH MY FUCKING GOD. I've never play D1. THANK YOU FOR THIS MASTERPIECE!

That would be fine if there wasn't some win conditions thrown in to obtain certain gear. That's what makes people super salty.

I heard that It’s because the map is actually very small and not being able to use sparrows is to make the map seem bigger.

Official Announcement: Tether in Mayhem is hella gay.

That doesn't explain how they're moving incredibly fast. Are they covering the same distance but better fps so it looks much faster?

My god, that's horrifying. I always thought they'd look like canines cause of the helmets, but nope.

Ha ha ha ha *sob sob sob*
---
I actually thought the armour was their skin.  Like it was super tough and everything, but not actually a separate thing.
---
Yeah, I'm noticing a lot of repetition between game manufacturers these days. It's like they steal each others' ideas/monsters/armour and change them up a bit. Time for a bit of inspiration in these game designs. The sausage factory approach, in some of the AAA games, is becoming obvious.
---
There's also a hive skull hanging from the belt in the King's Fall Hunter torso, right?
---
Oh I don’t like that before bed time at all no no no

I can still hear it now and feel the thrill of the final fight. Bloody brilliant.

There should be a circular race track on Mercury for our sparrows
---
Story time:
---
I got the Riskrunner early on in D2. Never used it, got the catalyst for it, grinded out the kills, and threw it back in my vault.
---
Not too long ago, I attempted to solo Shattered Throne on my Warlock. Got to Dul Incaru, and couldn’t hit my Whisper shots consistently enough to make it a viable option. So I searched around on /r/DestinyTheGame and YouTube to see if someone had another idea.
---
I cannot recall the video, or who posted it, but they recommended Riskrunner for ad control and damage to the knights. A couple of tries later, and boom, I had solo’d Shattered Throne.
---
Since then, [I have amassed over 12,000 kills with it.](https://i.imgur.com/4RIFiBs.jpg) 
---
The only weapon that has more kills in PVE for me?  ‘y trusty Midnight Coup, with [over 15,000](https://i.imgur.com/dF5AA47.jpg).
---
I am definitely a devout follower in the Cult of the Riskrunner. Bring on that arc damage.
---
Yeah ir just looks smoother ( also there are next to no loading areas if you have a beefy PC)
---
Charisma: 100
---
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa LOl
---
You wrote 9? Paragraphs and could have just said "git gud" because that's basically the tl:dr of it. (Though I did read it all)
---
And in a certain light, you're right. People who legitimately grind it out, get their rewards. But..
---
Lh/nf even objectively have ridiculously low ttk. You know this. (Recluse to a degree as well) So the average casual player...even on their good day with accurate shots isn't going to win that gunfight.
---
Problem is, they are pretty oppressive. However I'm not of the stance that they should be nerfed. 
---
I DO think that there should be pve equivalents in high tier pve. 
---
There are some that come close, granted..but they all have distinct weaknesses that lh/nf don't. (I.e. a proc on kill..etc)
---
It's a health issue with pvp in general honestly. Hardcores have no reason to stay in comp and casuals are basically forced into crucible as there's potential for powerful gear x10 a week in crucible between weeklies and dailies unless my math is wrong. 
---
So we put them in the same queue with high rated pvpers... Where's the mmr? That's likely the REAL root of the problem.... The matchmaking is borked.
---
And the "hate" as you describe it. (More annoyance than anything) is when you see someone running around bodying everyone because it's I guess fun for them?
---
It's like throwing 5 data entry clerks into a pit with an MMA veteran. The mma guy knows he can mop the floor with them, but still does just because he can.
---
A seasoned pvp'er with the highest ttk weapons in the game matchmade with people just trying to get their powerful gear rewards for the day/week. (Such skill!)
---
Don't be amazed when people are salty.
---
 When a pve'er gets his 1k voices or whatever powerful pve weapon... It's being generally used to make other people's lives easier to clear content.... 
---
Not emote spamming their corpse after losing a gunfight they were numerically unlikely to win in the first place.
---
Bow to no one was was one my favorites, but Sepiks Redux and Regicide were amazing too
---
Stab it!!!!

Looks like Shrike(Grike) from Mortal Engines....

I'm shocked there's not some comment complaining about how this photo was taken, shocked I say

You forgot the Gunslinger

imagine being this entitled

I feel your pain bro
---
Because they suck. Simply put. 
---
I have a Luna's, and love when I kill with it. But when someone with a Not Forgotten kills me, I say that piece of shit, and move on. I know they worked for it.
---
Do you realize how sad it is to go out of your way to write someone a message of hate in a video game. It's quite sad.
---
And this is why I play with other weapons when I play in low tier comp matches, I just wanna give a fair game to players still going for Fabled

---
What a man, what a spectral blades
---
Yeah you're using Spectral Blades though so it kinda nullifies the achievement that super lasts way too long and you get to spam a single attack almost 30 times.
---
Gwinsin vest aswell
---
Bullseye.
---
Bungie thinks they can dangle NF at 5450 out to keep players in the comp mode past 2100.  It's not working.  Comp is so bad that even players who love PvP and are willing to improve aren't attempting the climb.
---
CammyCakes is another example, he used to do educational videos on climbing in comp and he has no interest in doing an updated one for the current meta.  
---
Trails or something similar needs to come back if they want the sweaties out of quickplay.
---
Only real way to plau
---
Just run the Bug In The System adventure but doing claim the chest, abandon activity and go again until you're done.
---
Sneezes and accidentally activates bladebarrage
---
Yeah actually I forgot about that one, I want the house of meryin one but can’t get it for the life of me.
---
You can get Forsaken for around 20 € - I also saw a bundle including the annual pass for 34 €. Both good deals.
---
I’m kind of in the same boat, but one step behind. I’m limited in play time due to family so I haven’t been able to get a shattered throne run to progress. 
---
I’m also on Xbox and in Australia. Hit up the whirlpool clan, there’s some helpful guys/girls in there.
---
Its not really that its more balanced.. its that there isnt 12 people on maps designed for 8... 6s is just a stupid idea
---
Journey would like a word with you
---
I really like "Ancient Republic." If I don't use this I use iron banner specific ones :D (Iron Strength)
---
i definitely agree.  i love the perk of full auto and wish it was a perk on Blast Furnace.  But sadly it's not, so I too stick with Bygones.
---
You could probably use something like smoke screen for consistant melee dmg so you can just keep on shooting without having to worry about melee.
---
Court of Oryx isn’t bad too
---
Who’s that cutie
---
Dude in QP yesterday I was only running into a bunch of 4+ stacks farming spawn-traps with Recluse and Not Forgotten. I figured it couldn’t be worse in comp, and hey, it wasn’t. I could leave the spawn, what a concept lmao. Also I won a lot more, so that was nice, I gained about 400 glory
---
This put a smile on my face
---
Why aren’t you using slovabomb which has bloom with dire helmet?
---
Damnit, beat me to it
---
I have all of the expansions (Warmind, CoO, and Forsaken), but I don't have the Annual Pass.
---
I didn't even know there was a reckoning pulse. I need to get this weapon. Thanks.
---
For me, the game modes are just not fun. I don’t play comp because I just couldn’t care less about a rank in Destiny, if I want to play ranked PvP I’ll go play a game that was actually designed for it like Siege. By not playing comp I’m already depriving myself of Countdown and Survival. QP only having 2 game modes is boring. Fun game modes like Rift and Salvage were left behind in D1 which I still don’t get why. Also, the QP/Comp playlist split just appeal to me, the D1 system was far superior, if I want to play control I’ll go to the control playlist etc. We need more fun game modes, remember Scorched? I had such a blast going in and just messing around. A Halo style “Action Sack” playlist would really help.
---
I didn’t either, I got it drop from gambit prime I think? But i’m fairly sure the weapons drop across both, it’s a 540 archetype, I got mine with full auto and rampage and it’s an energy weapon called outlast :)
---
If you live close by and just get the day pass then yes I think it's worth it. I would also assume since they made the announcement so far ahead of time they will be revealing some stuff about year 3 at the event.

---
Im gonna be honest, no clue. I think i just forgot to change it to the slova bomb and i was too lazy to do it mid match
---
It's not that it's a bad idea to do it right off especially in prime, it's just that it's a whole lot more rewarding to get an ace whole they're supering and heal the primeval as well as opposed to a full health one.

"Only the Avatar could master the 4 elements..."
---
You’re missing out on some amazing sound design.
---
The Ogre pushback from the big laser is even more irritating than the regular stomp pushback. It's another "not fun, just annoying" mechanic that should be changed if possible.
---
Boss, you killed a child!
---
Meme template?
---
Nope, turns out I'm using an ornament lol. It's the Thundergod ornament that makes it more samurai-ish with the rope.

I imagine they don't let us on account of the infinite forest. Idk how but its probably fucky with sparrows going in and out of the portals

Shaxx ali the way! Foi know why?

1- he married us all!

2- WE ARE HIS FAVORITE GUARDIANS, HE DINT CARE!

Finally a heavy slot hand cannon
---
The catch is controlling the recoil
---
I'll only quote myself:
---
&gt;smh
---
Read that as you will.
---
idk man it was like 3am and I was sleep deprived. German (at least I think that's German) is just kinda a funny language to me (no offence of course)
---
If it’s in the game, what difference does it make? No ones going to forget about Prometheus lens at the beginning of curse of Osiris anytime soon. If it’s in the game it’s part of the meta, and therefore is part of the balance.
---
Mhm sure
---
I just got the exact same bow with the same rolls
---
I see nothing wrong in this picture, keep going
---
Did Crota raid yesterday. helped us win.
---
On a side note, my friend ( whose played less than 1/2 a year on D1) got a year 1 icebreaker, the bastard.
---
You can most definitely outrange Luna’s, but not the NF. The entire purpose of the NF is to take that weakness away from Luna’s. And slightly doesn’t begin to describe it. Minimum ttk, assuming you don’t start the engagement with howl active, is 2 headshots into a body. To do that on other hand cannons, you either have to have memento Mori on ace, or go up 3 archetypes to duke and such, where shooting 3 bullets takes forever, and the trust archetype (Luna’s) takes 3 headshots and a body
---
So your calling hunters nothing but massive bitches...I concur
---
got a pic of that?
---
ez Recluse
---
Ah shit, here we go again.
---
Same reason my blueberries were running sentinel shield when it was arc singe yesterday...
---
Getting killed twice by the same super oh and also a titan smash just for the electric icing on the top.
---
Sony being pricks once again.
---
I understand your idea and it might work if destiny wasn't so connected when it comes to pve and PvP and how they intertwine. I think the real problem is how easy supers are to use. Decreasing damage resistance or increasing damage against supers would be a good step. As well as adjusting super mods.
---
That sounds like some buggy, bullshit.  I am sorry my dude.
---
Have you done any of the Last Wish?  Either the first or second encounter should also drop it.
---
&gt;&gt; I barely remember about this mechanic but i’m fairly certain that does stop at a certain light level and at that light level (685 i think you were right there)
---
I thought so too. Was ready for the grind but it definitely is giving higher upgrades now. I definitely didn’t raise my light/power 1 point at a time from 680-ish to 700
---
&gt;&gt; there’s still a good 30 or so other ways to get powerful gear
---
19 per week if you don’t do crucible and I have not forgotten anything. Plus however many prime engrams you find.
---
I think some of the weekly bounties for Gambit add one or two more powerful gear drops.
---
I don’t own the Annual Pass so I don’t know for sure but I guess Armory will have a couple additional Powerful bounties.
---
They are in the game, you’re just too lazy to fucking read them.  There is literally a lore section in the triumphs page.  And the stories in the lore weave in and out of gameplay.  The TLW, Thorn, and Malfeasance quests all connected to some of the best lore in the game.  In D1 basically every interaction with the hive had some deep connection with the lore in the books of sorrow.  Everything in the dreaming city has deep lore implications.  Even CoO had the story of Saint-14 to tell.  If you’re oblivious to all of these stories then you shouldn’t be complaining about a lack of good writing.
---
I haven’t.  I have 2 other people left in my clan and group of friends who still play the game.  And just have never gotten around to LFGing the raid. 
---
Really weird too as I got all 3 seeds of light on my hunter no problem.
---
It's missing:
---
*did you mean to say* boring?
---
Eyes up guardian
---
Yeah that sounds about right, either way though there’s still plenty to do if you want to avoid crucible altogether, that’s just my opinion I suppose but still? 
---
19 per week is still a lot, prime engrams drop fairly often so maybe call it like 25 by the time you’ve done everything with the help of primes and then i think black armoury add a few, but i’m not actually certain as I don’t do it, either way i wasn’t too far off lol
---
exactly, everybody triggers from time to time, thats normal.
---
Problem is that ppl that do not have luna yet just want to send some subtle message like "hey i dont have luna yet, soo dont use it on me".
---
thats not gonna happen, everyone wants the weapon, and honestly is a super fun weapon, and if you battled the glory rank to get, you have 100% right to use it.
---
just to make it clear, i dont have it yet, but im not gonna growl to people and offend them/their families because if a weapon in a game, for real. :)
---
you gotta do all 61 Triumphs in the “Strikes” category of the Vanguard Triumphs for it
---
Better devils
---
Well, it’s usually really good, meaning that I usually would have a solid connection. I would have a lower ping when playing battlefield V or 1
---
Every push back mechanic in every game needs to die in a hole.
---
Helm of rull from leviathan
---
i mean, you’re not *wrong* but Ace, TLW, and Thorn are still in D2, and if you want Hawkmoon, just hop on D1, it’s still gonna be there
---
We already have this in the game, it's the Laconic ornament for TLW. Shit's actually 2 feet long
---
^F^r^i^c^k
---
Of course, I get triggered a lot in comp i’ll tell you that for nothing hahahaha. 
---
That’s 100% true, but I guarantee that if anyone grinds to get it, especially players who aren’t that good, they’ll use it because it’s not easy to get at all, also people who paid for it will 100% use it because they’ve paid real money. 
---
That’s honestly exactly my thought, it was a stupid play on bungies part but nonetheless it’s in now, go and get one or find something else. 
---
Also bro, i can’t do it this season as i’m too high rank now, but when the next season drops, if you by chance play ps4 i’ll happily play with you and see if we can’t get you to 2100 rank for the new pinnacle weapon and a luna :)
---
Or giving everyone access to the Titan suppressor grenade
---
Kk thanks what shader is that makes the gun look very cool
---
new and improved space toaster comes with automatic bread generation
---
Did bungie just assume my exos gender...
---
Congrats on your achievement for getting luna, but pls dont be one more of those who just go DRB, luna, wardcliff, spectralblades in qp. There are way too much.
---
It...it doesn’t feel right
---
I don’t like that feeling
---
You're only 39 points away.
---
Assuming you've played 3 Comp matches this week, you'll hit Fabled tomorrow at reset.
---
The one after morgeth iirc
---
It is very funny when you get blasted into the seventh dimension and it's just like, a low stakes mission or something. BUT when it's in Reckoning and your team wipes because you can't drop your well ... it's less fun.
---
Sony can be making the best games on console, but they're still massive scumbags when it comes to being user-friendly.
---
I find it silly though.
---
Like I get being mad that zavala wouldnt get revenge. Buy he did have some good points.
---
And ultimately. Cayde himself said the vanguard was the best bet he lost. Cayde would want us to stick with the vanguard and help his friends. Sure zavala fidnt go for revenge but the city is still rebuilding, he has to think clearly and put it first before his own personal feelings.
---
Except for all the people who pay for "recoveries".
---
Thats when you turn down in game sound, and turn up the DOOM OST.
---
If you played 3 (or more) games this week, you will get 120 points on reset as a bonus.
---
So, congrats on your Luna/Recluse/Mountaintop. (What ever it is)
---
Not at all. Guns have little to no recoil on PC. They're lasers. So when a PC player goes to console they have to deal with recoil, something they're not used to compensating for. 
---
Put a console player on PC, someone used to compensating for recoil, you're just removing a step for them, not adding one like you would be if you put a PC player on console.
---

The horror! Have some humanity, man!
---
If you can’t beat em, join em, or just quit I like the latter personally
---
Sorry some blueberry wearing no invader armor stole it
---
The hype about Breakneck is that it's arguably the best Auto Rifle in the game, with a perk so powerful it might as well be an Exotic. Shreds through ads and majors when rampage is proced. If it feels clumsy to you, you must be doing something wrong because it's point and shoot.
---
Summer Rain, right? I want it, I missed out on Y1 on PC
---
Cayde was hella obnoxious and took away any seriousness(?) from the vanilla story.
---
Nova bomb + skull is infinite super though. Wells boring
---
That's how you should roll by default.
---
there’s always a bigger fish
---
Without Forsaken, there really isn't much new to do, and progression was made MUCH slower than it was before Forsaken (I suspect as a way to encourage people out of sheer frustration to purchase it). 
---
I would say Forsaken is worth more than the base game in terms of how much it adds to the experience. 
---
Whether or not the annual pass (bundle of three DLCs after Forsaken) is worth it is more subjective. You don't absolutely need those, and they do not add nearly as much.
---
Umm... there is recoil on PC, but it's not as strong, and you still have to compensate for it. PC players also have way better movement, strafing is super easy, and the ability to flick to a target is insane. Compare PC and console gameplay, they might as well be two different games.
---
No there are no bugs, only unexpected features
---
Hell, I don't mind running a well, but it'd be nice for the FUCKING HUNTER TO ACTUALLY CAPTURE THE ZONE INSTEAD OF AVOIDING IT AND SPAMMING TETHER.
---
Not mine, but about a 1/3
---
The Big Succ exotic shell
---
He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold.
---
I can see them being super cold. 🤔 never thought about it
---
I would like some feedback from the elite pvp. I know u guys need some better end game pvp. Other than carrying the few misfortunate or desperate enough via phone app to help the lowly pvp bottom feeders. Myself included. To give urself some challenge. Someone needs to stop bungie from havin this escallate to more rage quits and game abandonning
---
Ah right, remember now. Haven't used it a while so I kinda forgot how it looked lol
---
Why did you jump? Don't jump. This is your fault. You know what they do. You know how it works. You only need to break LOS and you know you can't do that in the air
---
Why did you leave the well? Why did you jump?
---
It's a video of a guy in the crucible shooting the ground  to kill another player.
---
Why say random rude stuff like this instead of making a counterargument? Are you that afraid of being wrong?
---
What did they do to buff it? Because when they nerfed it they gutted it. They nerfed its duration by almost 7 seconds, which is **a ton** AND they made each explosion cost more energy so now you only get to cast it 4 times, if you're lucky, before it's over. But good luck even getting to cast it 4 times because they also made you less tanky while casting it and now it feels like using Nova Warp is just a death sentence. And as if that wasn't enough they also nerfed its damage (increasing the amount of time you need to charge it to get a kill) and they nerfed the speed you move at while charging it, making it much easier for enemies to avoid even if you do survive long enough to get off all 4 explosions.
---
I didn't even think it was that great before the nerf, just a bit annoying/strong in Crucible and a decent way to clear a lot of weak ads but after the nerf it became the worst super in the game.
---
You were the one that said I was full of shit. Take accountability for what you said, isn’t that what you were telling me?
---
Thats what most titans run for reckoning. Bottom tree with doom fangs is infinite super if there are enemies to kill. Its the best for ad clearing on titan and its still a super so it does not need a singe to make it do good dmg.
---
No. There is no way to change it. Technically that's true. Unable to change.
---
You could delete and start again. That's not changing.
---
Because the team can easily spread out while killing envoys, it’s better to wait until the damage phase that way they either need to keep damaging the prime and risk death or split up to be safe but miss out on a damage phase
---
Nah... I'mma keep y'all in suspen
---
But why? Nolan North did a great job. I was surprised when I was told that Cayde-6 in Forsaken was **not** voiced by Fillion, because I did not hear any significant difference.
---
I was a bit upset, but not disappointed.
---
Why did you edit your comment?
---
every day I'm sweeping
---
All strike bosses killed with emotes. “Actually free”
---
I finally got the exotic ship Universal Wavefunction yesterday, after almost 20 hours of grinding. It was a very emotional time :)
---
No
---
I have fun through actually succeeding at the stuff I attempt. Not face planting numerous times because I'm too stubborn to play the subclass that nets the most success. /shrug
---
People just have allegiances. I didn't know until this very comment that the voice of Cayde had ever changed and I've been through Forsaken 3 times.
---
This question and many more will be answered on the next episode of dragon-ball-Z
---
&lt;humor&gt; When you're playing Dark Souls?
---
&gt;too stubborn to play the subclass that nets the most success
---
But you can win without picking the highest chance of success? Not everyone only cares about getting through it and having the prize.
---
As you play you'll eventually hit what is referred to a soft cap in the drops you get, meaning that weapons and armor won't be higher level than you, you need to then complete daily and weekly milestones to get what is called powerful gear, milestones are things like playing crucible matches, doing nightfalls, certain vendor bounties etc
---
I love Destiny, but maybe too soon here
---
Mine serve a purpose: to let people know they’re stupid. Literally why I made this account because I was sick of all the harhar towerthough DAE hate women and minorities bullshit
---
I'm a hunter and clearly this thing is a problem. We bleed the same blood as you do, team mate.
---
I’m pretty sure you don’t have to download anything extra
---
buying dlc is more like a key to play the rest of the game
---
All right, thanks
---
[deleted]
---
It's one of the best supers in the game for PVE currently.
---
If you use it with the exotic Skull of Dire Ahamkara, it's near infinite if you get kills
---
There pretty good in pve too! But you wouldent know cause you wont try to learn how to get good.!! Your the kinda guy that spams jotunn or telesto then sends rage mail cause some one has better map awareness and you dont understand how to strafe, run, jump, pick a lane, team shoot and oh yea grind pvp rolls for guns that do and can compete.  You just keep running to the last position 4 gaurdians finger banged you expecting to one man army the entire team, like your pve weapons are gonna do work on a autistic thrall in a strike. .. ..   you are the pvp variant of testicular cancer change my mind!
---
Crazy how I don't believe that Bungie would suddenly change from the development pattern they have stuck to for a year and a half for any tiered/leveled mode, where different levels are different, and thus yes i think it is a bug... But no, that opinion makes me entitled... (Do you know what that word means). And yes I do know what a bug is, software development is my profession lol
---
Fighting lion w/ flash and thunder or militias birthright. 
---
Or, be a Titan and rally barricade and spam
---
Or, be a well of radiance warlock with Luna boots and watch your no reload grenade launchers one shot people on a proximity detonation.
---
Or grab heavy boxes and run a heavy grenade launcher
---
I know there is a lot of titan love but I'm team hunter..I don't think SB are OP but I would like to see Bungie do something about the duration or at least suck more of the super energy when the light attack is being spammed...kind of like a nova warp mechanic.
---
I have to say, on previous FPS games I was never the one to run in guns blazing.  I always played it slow and steady.  Figured it was my old man reflexes.  On D2 though, man, I love taking my hunter with triple jump and a sub machine gun and just diving into a group of enemies and laying waste to them.  
---
That is exactly how I play the quick play.   I will play some quests or other missions for a while, then jump into quick play for a couple games when I feel brave enough.
---
Yes it is a screenshot of a weapon with a caption, and it seems like it made some people chuckle so my work here is done. I'm sorry if it didn't quite fit your taste.
---
Lmao no, that's not how it works. How is any meaningful discussion supposed to happen when people say dumb sarcastic nonsense like this
---
It’s not even creative or funny for that matter you people will laugh at anything I swear
---
After you've earned it once, Redrix's Broadsword can drop with different mag and barrel perks from any activity that drops other crucible gear. 
---
Every pinnacle weapon quest that is not an achievement can be done once per character.
---
Ah I see. Thanks
---
It's absurd, I've reset my gambit rank once by **only** playing prime and completing bounties. Haven't found anything else other than the pulse rifle, the scout rifle, nade launcher and the sniper.
---
ooF
---
I believe it is 7.
---
If your reading this bungie. This is mostly your fault for leaving the casual pvp player without a level playing field. Is it so hard to understand that  valor rank shows only participation not skill. A player can have a 1000valor from only loosing without a single win. While glory is an exact performance point system. Only a winning player with a 1/2 win/loss ratio has a chance though a rough grind. Throw us low glory rank in with those who completed the fabled rank and u have effectively a child fighting a man. Then ull have bungie try to make a bullshit team: 2x A rank. 4x E rank. Against team of 4x B rank . 2x c rank . to have the A rank players getting dragged down by the others while the low rank still get pawned. Im no server designer but i certainly played enough pvp.online games to know they cam do better. Look at cod . fortnight and apex legends. The load screen shows the team total ranking. Shame on u bungie. Get to work before all the casual players give up. A simple suggestion would be to create.a quickplay lobbie for those who have a high glory rank

If you want I can delete it, like I'm sad for that too so it's not a problem. Just let me know
---
I used Duty Bound to grind Breakneck. Finally got it just to find that Duty Bound is like 100 times better.
---
I can hear Mr. SHAXXX SCREAMING IN MY HEADDDD @.@  
---
Excellent BTW!
---
I'd grind for this, Levi is one of my favourite raids!
---
Rip. Thank you tho 👍👍👍
