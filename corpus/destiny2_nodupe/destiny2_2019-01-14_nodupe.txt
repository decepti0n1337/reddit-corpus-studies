Been here since the start. Not sure why I'm surprised anymore 
---
---
---
Okay, this is epic
---
&gt; For my energy, i use Riskrunner
---

---
I dont understand, is that particular weapon gets super good when its masterworked? I've tried to use it and i just struggle unless im against vex. 
---
And i agree they absolutely should be very atrong, but right now theyre far too good. Queen breaker being the main offender honestly. That charge time and ludicrous aim assist is just too much. But i do absolutely agree they need to be strong as theyre power weapons. Maybe just not thus strong lol

Gambit leather, for weapons, gunmetal and wood is all I need. Same could be said about gambit Chrome, for the silver and ivory.
---
Ace can actually beat NF/Compete with it very well if you‚Äôre good with it. I‚Äôm not unfortunately so I‚Äôve stayed w Trust for most of comp and it feels similar to Luna‚Äôs. Lunas doesn‚Äôt make you instantly a god or anything tho so while it feels good to get I still need to practice with it to get the full use :)
---
Excuse me
---
I just ran it twice, only took like 49 minutes at the most
---
But ice breaker was the og sniper
---
Yes up until about 1200
---
How‚Äôs the grind to 600?
---
Hopefully üòÅ
---
Can't remember the channel that did it, but they used to do that back in D1
---
Good to know. What is it this week?
---
Thats awesome
---
**Buying one from Xur used to count. It no longer does. Neither do the Leviathan underbelly chests!**
---
Your only hope is to get a random exotic engram dropped from an enemy on the ground, or to get a catalyst. If the engram goes to your postmaster, it does not count. 
---
That no longer works for the quest, for some reason. 
---
Shotgun
---
Tower fuckery is the best part of destiny. We once had a 10+ guardian game of leapfrog going. It was the greatest achievement of my life. At least that's what I tell my children. 
---
Depending on perks and what you use your Hammerhead for then yes put a Boss Spec on it.  If you have a Hammerhead with Surrounded try putting a Surrounded spec on it.  I know there's some RNG to getting a Surrounded Spec so while you attempt to aqquire one you could use a Boss Spec.  
---
Congrats, guardian! 
---
Most people prefer as much recovery as you can get. Faster health recovery is always a good thing. 
---
I gotta try that out
---
yeah, there was one time i traded a nighthawk goldie bullet with a guy invading with queenbreaker... 
---
AND I NEVER REGRETTED 
---
That sounds awesome I'm going to look it up. I'm absolutely willing to learn I've just never played with anyone (in a raid) willing to teach or at a minimum use a mic.
---
I used a few, my suggestions;
---
-Vendor Bygones (Drifter sells w/ Full Auto and Kill Clip)
---
-Chattering Bone
---
-Blast Furnace
---
-Ace of Spaces
---
-Trust
---
-Dust Rock Blues
---
-The Chaperone
---
-Mindbenders Ambition
---
-Good Bone Structure (Slug Shottie) throw an Icarus mod on it and it‚Äôs even better
---
-Tractor Cannon (can one shot people out of their super)
---
I stuck with most of these except for Mindbenders bc I don‚Äôt have it. If you can learn to use some of these weapons in synergy with your favorite subclass I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll notice a small difference at least :)
---
Frik
---
me too
---
I had thought the same thing until I joined a team. You just have to be consistent and you will improve, teamwork and communication is the biggest factor in getting the weapon :)
---
Do the levuathan raids/lairs. They will drop exotics that are not autodecrypted.
---
I‚Äôd say NF is a ‚Äúsweat‚Äù grind. Luna‚Äôs isn‚Äôt as hard as people think but it is definitely a grind and you need to be prepared for that
---
It‚Äôs called Dawning Hope üòÅ 
---
P.S. It makes all your guns look like that!
---
the facts are all out , you just ignore them.
---
\-Game got sold for less than 10$ couple of times and gave it for free at some point \[Fact\]
---
\-Activision didnt really fight for the game rights and there was no drama \[Fact\] , do you really think that if the game was profitable they would let bungie go away freely?
---
"base game isnt worth anything down the line" is this facts or your opinion? the hypocrisy is making you look so stupid.
---
call of duty is underperforming if you compare it to the COD last games (the game still makes tons of money and set some sale records compared to other games and its a fact)
---
destiny is overall underperforming compared to other games and the goal that activision set.
---
yeah sure there is nothing wrong with content creators (some of them got most of their fans from specific game and were dedicated to that game) that move to another games.. (after initial sponsored stream/content) you need to ask yourself why does it happen and why wont the audience of this content creator move to the game either (beause they will)
---
and I know you will probably say "but why dont just play both", many people dont have much time and they prefer 1 main game (especially in this genre) and even if you play couple of games there will be always a game that is better and you will play more, if anthem will be that game, many people will move to it and there will be less players in destiny (did I mention that when anthem start kicking with the free updates , destiny2 will look even worse?)
---
The game isnt good and it just going to get worse as I said.
---
you think everything is good? Keep telling yourself that bud. 
---
I will remember that and will let you know how right you were . remindme! 40 days

Hi @Muzzy\_02! Just sent a response via chat to you with our charter and a request for your PSN ID. We are looking for new members, our player base is active and we want to foster this with more active players:) Perhaps you will be one of them! 
---
Play soon.
---
I would say just keep at it. Most of the controls will turn into muscle memory soon and it'll get easier. Set little goals and reach them. Work on always moving. Standing still in an FPS is a bad habit. Practice shooting at a target while moving. Another tip would be cover. Be aware of places to find cover from fire. Practice moving toward cover while firing at a target then reload when you get to cover. The other stuff will come soon enough. 
---
i think that‚Äôs worth an upvote. i just got 650 today along with a lot more
---
Another option that i personally use is the Sixth Coyote for damn near infinite invisibility with 2 paragon mods on
---
At Ada-1, the black armory curator. What she needs in return is black armory weapon schematics and mod parts. Getting the mod is randomized, so be ready for a grind. 
---
You'll get it. Got one from Hawthorne today. 
---
Been working just fine for me for days now. 
---
check your frame
---
I don't think he was talking literal in a sense. I don't like it because it's another launcher that will split the fan base from D2 and D3. We will get D3 on blizzard or D2 on a Bungie launcher with D3. However I believe it will be easier to sell D3 on the blizzard launcher because that is what the consumer is comfortable with. 
---
Still don't know why the activision tab still has Destiny 2 under it now that they split.  No idea if bungie will get their own tab.
---
I don‚Äôt use it all the time, but my halfdan-D feels pretty dang good! Only one that ever dropped for me was outlaw/killclip so that might be partially responsible for the effectiveness. I also use and see Misfit a lot
---
Just hit your shots 4Head
---
What really annoys me is that my friend, who barely plays D2, has it despite having only played Crucible a handful of times. But thank you!
---
My Jotunn fires its projectile way too slow to be a rail gun. IMHO. 
---
Emblem?
---
Titan armor sucks too. I don‚Äôt need giant feathers on my shoulders 
---

psshhhh, you actually jump before casting your super? everyone knows all epic gamers worldline launch themselves from the highest ledge in the map before golden gunning everyone in sight.
---
i imagine it‚Äôs still under the activision tab because d2 is still an activision published game, right? 
---
I wish this was all I needed for Cursebreaker. Unfortunately, I have to complete an even more difficult task for the title. I need to be blessed by RNGesus. That's all that stands between me and Cursebreaker and Dredgen. :/
---
&gt;  it only worked against people who only played with one brain cell. 
---
Then why do you care?
---
&gt; Doesn‚Äôt change the fact that this isn‚Äôt nearly a guarantee.  
---
Don't be like that now. The argument was about you saying it got nerfed into oblivion, which it wasn't. It did a thing before and it does the same thing now, just a little worse. Still does the same thing the same way. If you don't like it - go complain for it to be reworked or removed. Not unnerfed, that's just disingenuous.
---
Unless you feel like you're missing out on the content I wouldn't worry about playing warmind and Osiris. However if you jump straight to forsaken you'll be horribly under levelled and it'll take longer to level up. 
---
Ultimately you're call though dude.

Isn't it nice to be able to max without have to feed n get an average between the high gear low gear like in d1 and not having to sweat the raids with randoms who quit or lie about how "good" they are. I hated having my light lay in the hands of other guardians.
---
Solo first part Crota
---
Yes 5 people were afk, I was playing on Asian servers where afk players are pretty frequent. I can't do anything to make you believe me, I just posted this as a tip to people still doing the quest but ok, get angry at me I got my Ace that way and I'm happy to have it. 
---
Sadly we still lost though
---
D2 PvP servers are peer to peer, so if the host has bad connection then it's a bad time for everyone. That might be it. 
---
If you're on pc we should fireteam up ;D
---
join a clan if you don't have rl friends to play with and look for a clan that actually does stuff together and not just a clan that was made for the sake of.....having a clan  
---
I think the shotgun, but I've done it like 20 times and have only gotten shaders.
---
y tho
---
Rerolling masterworks is still possible for pre-forsaken weapons. Now you just have to get lucky that the masterwork you get is in the stat you want
---
Damn...is there anything I can do to at least know why I got the ban?
---
No the masterwork on y2 items is randomly rolled when the weapon drops, but you can not change the roll you get.
---
Queenbreaker?
---
It has the easiest Forge Warden, by far, and you can get rare bounties from max temper completions.
---
They're actually mostly still really good. Lack luster perk-wise, but their stats are solid. The energy auto rifle is better than every roll of the BA adaptive AR I've gotten so far. The SMG is lightweight with phase magazine, both pulse rifles are solid albeit with a useless perk for pvp. The scout is solid as well. 
---
The biggest thing about the CoO weapons is that their sights are all fantastic. 
---
Of course you lost. They had B1GJUGS on their team. They couldn't possibly lose.
---
Gotcha. That was my issue, the shotty is the forsaken version, I believe.
---
Oh, rare bounty drops? that I didn't know! I'v done it around 20 times now and no drop, so im guessing its a *rare* bounty. lol. 
---
But thanks, thats new info to me
---
Titan here! Important note: I have not successfully Flawless'd it yet, but I'm getting close.
---
In general, I pack a lot of weapons when going to Shattered Throne. I have not successfully finished it yet because dealing with the knights gives me a bit of a fit because I can't consistently land White Nail off Whisper. That said, I swap weapons frequently so I can have the right tool for the job.
---
In general: ammo economy for power+special weapons is how I make it work. My gauntlets have sniper scavenger and shotgun scavenger, and I have 3 special ammo finder perks and 1 heavy ammo perk. My helmet can switch to Machine Gun Scavenger from Special.
---
Subclass:
---
I run top tree Solar for emergency close quarters, the melt can be a life saver. Swap between Thermite and Fusion depending on what you need: Thralls and Acolytes, use Thermite, for boss fights and Healthy Boy damage, use Fusion. Use Big Barricade all the time, you never need to stand in one place for too long or you'll get focused. Pair with Hallowfire Heart for awesome ability cd reduction. I have one Recovery mod, one Super mod, 2 Ordnance mods, and an Impact.
---
My stats are 4/6/4, keeps me healthy long enough to make cover and then regen.
---
Weapon Selection:
---
\-Shotgun or Sniper in Kinetic, Whatever Exotic Primary ammo weapon in Special, and Avalanche/Hammerhead in Power. Power gets swapped to Whisper for Final Boss. Izanagi's Burden may take over the kinetic slot, but that'll take some re-configuring.
---
\-Polaris Lance reloads ammo from hammer space, so its ammo economy is really good and this stays in slot for most of the run. Any scout with Triple tap seems good, but Polaris makes a lot of the long distance engagements go really well because of the extra explosion+burn damage. Right Side of Wrong is a good sub and covers most of the Solar shields you'll run into.
---
\-Handling the Captain boss and the invisible Minotaurs can be a pain. I've tried running Izanagi's Burden against them for one shot potential. The Captain himself goes down quickly to Avalanche.
---
\-On Big Ogre Time, I like to swap to Fighting Lion. The adds tend to group up pretty close to the Wizards, so popping the shields yields big burst damage, which lets you clear groups quickly. You can get boss dps from a Hammerhead or similar hard hitting heavy. I leave Whisper out for this section because it's generally not needed. Do not attempt to use Melting Point, you'll just get crushed.
---
\-Getting through the Thrall room tends to be a pain, but if you know the Thrall AI, it can be easy to jump(not lift) away from their attacks. Side-straffing and cutting corners is key. Occasionally I'll swap in Crimson because any ability that says "restores health" gets around the no-regen penalty in that section.
---
\-Climbing the tower: lots of captains and Phalanxes, who suck. Swap weapon slot types here: Breakneck or Go Figure for Kinetic, Ikelos for Energy, Whisper in Heavy. This is where you wanna stock as much ammo as possible going into the boss room.
---
\-Boss room: Pray. Switch to Thermite Grenade so you can clear Psion spawns, use Barricade on angles so that you don't block off all points of attack for yourself. Unless you manage to land lots of Whisper shots, you probably won't kill enough Knights before the first crystal spawns, which just means you need to clear ads and \*then\* kill knights for the stacks.
---
They drop from nightfall, not heroics. I think one NF is enough for a full stack and you can farm them indefinitely.
---
How the actual fuck? I cant even get one to 650.
---
What blessed RNG running on what must be my 30th w one now, wish me luck! 
---
My, my, my, how the mighty have fallen...
---
uwu *I'm green jacket* ÔΩ°‚óï‚Äø‚óïÔΩ°
---
Is he a streamer or youtuber?
---
Holy shit! 
---
This ain‚Äôt true. Thuderlord actually has a higher DPS than Hammerhead due to its lighting rounds and ramping up perks (unless the Hammerhead has a rampage perk and the person using it just recently got a kill before you), and level has nothing to do with PVP unless it‚Äôs Iron Banner. And you can easily get a Bygones with rampage or kill clip and shit on someone with a Blast Furnace. Crucible is super easy, just click on their heads lul. 
---
Seriously.

So he fucked up her life and destroyed her kids beyond repair? You the villain OP. Karen deserves better.

Eating all the Blueberries 
---
Congrats! I‚Äôm trying to do the same.
---
Proof?
---
Did it drop on a powerful frame for you or just random drops from other loot/frames? 
---
First, you got it for free. You get what you pay for. You complain about unbalance, everyone of the things you mentioned, is easillycountered if you actually play the game. Stop parroting the whiners. 
---
I'm using ALOT of y1 stuff, armour and weapons in both pve and pvp. Next week you'll find me in my y1 armour, and my orimunds anvil pretty much full time.
---
Tou remind me of the kid at work crying because his 86 truck doesn't has all the bells and whistle the new ones do.

It‚Äôs gonna be so nutty after the buff
---
And it's so annoying that we don't know which subclasses our teammates are using (by seeing their nametag) to avoid having two wells. I just want to know what subclass they are instead of "Dredgen"

I believe its from shooting all the eggs in the dreaming city (but make  sure to do it all on one character because it was bugged)

I know. I think it looks fantastic and want to be able to at least try it on. I still only have two pieces....

Everytime I see the abbreviation "CoO" my mind automatically thinks court of oryx, and I cant figure out why the hell someone is doing the court now.... lol. It confuses the hell out of me for a few seconds.

I submit: ‚ÄúThe Carried‚Äù

As in, ‚Äúthanks for carrying us, 650‚Äôs who actually know what you‚Äôre doing.‚Äù
---
Those are my thoughts. However when they continue Activision won't be present. 
---
rip, wish you future luck
---
the catalyst gives it almost max range, and makes it act like a 3 burst pulse rifle almost.. its amazing
---
Hold it, you said you just had the free version. Keep the story straight dude.
---
And kiddo, this old man with arthritic thumbs has no problem with and of those weapons. 
---
Congrats man. Although, I feel like this is not that hard with just one character. Every week just do your dailies and Weeklies, Dreaming City, spider bounties, Forge. Not trying to put you down though, congrats on your hard work paying off. :)
---
"Ready to see who you're talking to today?"

You know the free version doesn't have the expansion right?

I‚Äôm not sure what it means, I don‚Äôt have any aeon cult Armour equipped. I honestly have no clue

Laugh now little one you have till the 29th then no more painic spamming of blade barrage or wittle wuntter gets killed 
---
Yah, in gambit today I was invading and I no shit. Got body shot with the exotic sniper, full shield and overshield. That is the only sniper in the game that can one shot body shot a invader. It is insane.
---
Yep, Sony fanboys are getting so desperate. Using his logic, PS4 has almost no exclusives too since the majority of them can be streamed on PS Now, and you don't even need to own a PS4 to create a PSN account.
---
Nah bro not even, it‚Äôs all good! It‚Äôs fun achieving something in the game you enjoy. But nah you never have to apologize for your opinion it‚Äôs all good with me. GG my friend! 
---
it‚Äôs a buff from the most crappy, useless exotics in the game. each class has an aeon arm exotic that gives a small (very small) amount of ability energy

Ya we know the weeks we make sure we do it the right week

Lucky pants gang

Wow

Okay, thanks man. I was weirded out by it at first because it only lasted a second and happened randomly. Thanks

That‚Äôs hilarious dude that guy is suck a hypocrite lol

bruh ya still got em

Hope his name is Shin!

Thank you OP. I saw another one a few days ago and it was slighty annoying to witness. The guy was sliding up walls and taking more time to line up more difficult jumps.

I found this method by accident aka pedal to the metal and hoping i don't die.

hahah i know exactly the feeling, just got past that milestone myself

Where‚Äôs dust rock blues hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
---
I don't use blade barrage in crucible, I don't need panic supers. 
---
Yeah, they can all be infused
---
Hmmmmm
---
TBH Cerberus +1 is my best and favorite kinetic weapon... that gun is what makes me kick ass in Crucible and Gambit.
---
I have potato aim so it‚Äôs that much more infuriating when I actually hit my shots and something like this happens. Thankfully its been few and far between for me in D2. D1 red bar warriors were off the charts.
---
are you on pc?
---
If I couldn‚Äôt find a way I would contact support
---
This... This right here is why i keep coming back to this Reddit.
---
You're not very bright are you? 
---
China has had a rocky relationship with censorship, and other platforms (steam, primarily). It makes sense to invest in a company that isn't in a relationship with steam, and consistently produces games that don't require censorship. And since Bungie probably still owes Activision ~200 million, getting a cash infusion is probably the only way they could dissolve the partnership and get what they want. Netease is also likely trying to diversify their portfolio. Doing the whole Diablo thing was probably a first step in doing that, while still staying in their wheelhouse (mobile games). 
---
This is just a guess. But it'll be interesting. I somewhat doubt Bungie wants to do a mobile Destiny game. I also doubt it's off the table, either though.
---
im sorry you ll have to be louder my ears are fucked cuz o dat thunder fucking lord 
---
i am 630 in gofannon witch is recommended 610.
---
You can get one from bergusia, I got one dropped a few days ago üòÄ
---
I'm on PlayStation (jmanzano1989). I'm from Spain and on weekends is hard for me to know at what time I'll be playing (if I do at all) but I'd be awesome to add you as friend just in case (thanks!). BTW any armor/weapon suggestion for the activity?
---
That‚Äôs comp for ya
---
Dude if you really didn¬¥t do anything wrong besides getting disconnected a few times you shouldn¬¥t be perma banned, perhaps just a suspension. If you didn¬¥t intentionally disconnected sounds a bit unreasonable to me to get banned. Then again, if you know your internet sucks and that chances are you will disconnect while playing, you should not be doing Crucible or Gambit imo. You shoud be reasonable too
---
Thank you, I‚Äôve ran it like 30 times no dice 
---
Prbably best to join a clan and play with some mates
---
you have lost our interest
---
Isnt oryx a gril?
---
Nice!! I‚Äôm just getting into the game again.. I‚Äôm doing terrible so far.
---
Yeah 
---
Isn't there a quest or something and if not I'm only 630 I thought it was recommended 650
---
"Time lord Kevin is back to his old tricks"
---
I got that, but the difference there is a bit much no?
---
Cayde 6 deserved it #change my mind 
---
Ye I'm 1 char, only play a couple days a week, no raids, and hit 650 before Christmas. It's totally achievable, especially since even after you've done you're weekly milestones you still inadvertently grind Prime Engrams while grinding for other less useful stuff (pinnacle weapon quests, the dawning nonsense, NF high scores etc....)
---
You're also using oathkeepers without a bow
---
I grinded all of them back in year 1. Took 78 total level 7 runs to get all of them. First 14 for the shotgun, then 55 runs for two SMGs (one dropped 48th and the other one on 52nd), and at last the sniper after on my final 78th run. Now I have 82 total runs. And have gotten three SMGs, one Shotgun and one Sniper from the heroic adventures when it‚Äôs the flashpoint. But... good luck I guess. Your lucky, it‚Äôs year 2 with all the increases in RNG.
---
Hulk,  just for once in your life,  don't smash.

 Although it was at the top of destiny memes all day,  so I would guess it's a repost from there.

Definitely agreed there

IIRC, It‚Äôs Hulk when he is going to start a fight with Surtur, on the bridge.

You stole this.

I agree, it was soo satisfying for me and others who are still getting there keep it up.
---
CBS cares

Oh okay, thank you :D
---
It would make a bit more sense if he was wearing Nighthawk, still a 9/10 meme
---
Well, for some players loading into the match might take longer than 20-30 seconds. When stuck on the black screen while playing with a clan member it probably took something between 1-2 minutes for us to get into the match. We usually entered when the match just was lost. The timer does not instantly run... there is a delay of maybe 10-15 seconds... and then you have 45-60 seconds time (dunno exactly). In most cases the 3rd Player which was on the map already even made a few points and therefore increased the time a bit... so.... 1-2 minutes.
---
If you play alone your only chance is to make as many points as possible during the first Phase and hope that the other Players can spawn in before the timer reached 0.
---
If you play with a friend which has a slow i-net connection ist probably best to fill the fireteam with a 3rd player before starting a forge match so the entire Team can spawn at the forge at the same time without the risk that the forge match initiates before all players have loaded into the map.
---
Well played, may it be the first of many!!
---
The catalist is kind of worth it, if you often switch your weapon after firing. It definitely has potential to enhance your pvp loadout, but I am still experimenting with it so I can't say for sure. 
---
Also you just need to have it in your character invetory for the bounties to count.
---
Eh, I've reported every one of them I've seen and I occasionally still bump into the same people in games weeks later. Reporting unfortunately does very little.
---
Nah, except you can get J√∂tunn. In addition, you can complete every frame in bergusia, regardless of what the frame says as forge-requirement
---
*teleports behind you*
---
They mean the good music 
---
Oof, that is a salty Titan. Reminds me of a guy I knew on the GameFAQs Titanfall 2 boards, djwagon. He was so salty it was like an ocean in there.
---
Also the obsidian accelerator which can be turned in to ada for a mod to make your forged guns stronger in the forge

Can we send one if it is our own?
---
Well done mate! Grinded my ass off and completed it in three weeks, and I'm just waiting for strange terrain nf, so I can get my Wayfarer title :D
---
Still fairly new to EP; do you have to farm up the decrypted key and hope its not an armor piece, or is it just a drop?
---
Brace yourselves.....a sturm is coming
---
If you mean matchmaking, there is for Strikes (dungeons), Crucible (PvP) and Gambit (hybrid PvE/PvP).
---
Nightfalls (hard-mode dungeons) and Raids have a Guided Game option that supposedly finds you a clan to do a run with. Never got it to pop myself, so can‚Äôt say much on this.
---
Certain ‚Äòhidden‚Äô group content like The Whisper and The Shattered Throne do not have matchmaking.
---
you are in for a treat!
---
Titan is a lifestyle, not a character
---
624 is enough.
---
I try my first forge at 619, it's was hard at the second wave but we finally beat the boss with my (matchmaked) squadmates.
---
Sometimes the matchmaking put some very low level gardians with you, try again and be patient.
---
I'am 630 now and have unlocked the last forge yesterday, i just need to do some milestones before making the last step to unlock Bergusia.
---
Good luck !
---
No he's dead. There's a corpse lying in a monument. He killed them for over a hundred years. Then they made a Mind to drain his light. 
---
He killed that one too. Then, _then_ he died. And the Vex said "...Fuck that guy, and everything about him but **fuck** did he take us for a ride. BUILD A MONUMENT."
---
Thanks, I'll just keep trying then)
---
I heard if you save a few and turn them in all at once you have a higher chance of getting a rare. So I tried it and it worked. Was it just luck? Probably. But it doesn't hurt to try. 
---
He was until he killed that worm god
---
In fairness sake to Saint-14, it took the Vex _hundreds of years to kill him._ Then he killed the Mind that drained his light. Yeah he may have gone down but he led literal mountains of Vex to the afterlife as his palanquin bearers. 
---
LORD SHAXX, (PBUH) needs a Twilight Gap strike. I don't even care if its 15min of Shaxx dunking anything with four shoulders. Just an entire strike narrated by Shaxx.

you are unlucky. most high players probably run last forge leaving more players in the others that cant get to the last one. first 2 forges are easy after 615 . (If you really need help on pc i got time on wednesday or weekend)
---
Can I borrow your luck? 
---
This gun looks sick and stable (not much recoil). WHat's the name of that beatuy?
---
Friend: 11, why are you solo queuing Comp?
---
Me: Oh I had to do 2 rounds to get this pesky milestone off my Director, and since Shaxx had a quest to do 10 I thought, yanoe, mightaswell. I‚Äôm on round 8 ‚Äî
---
Friend: Stop. Now.
---
Me: Why?
---
*A bit of Googling later*
---
Me: *stops and never returns*
---
i am pretty sure it tells you you can forge all frames there. not sure where but i think on the map icon
---
Generally Activision does no longer have influence on the game which is good. Bungie is free to make own decisions and break free from the resticted release cycle.
---
If that is good or bad is hard to tell. Bungie might now have more time to release quality content instead of rushed content. But that also means we might have to wait longer for new content to arrive. Im not sure if that is what players want.
---
Next to that did Activision provide a good amount of money that helped Bungie to develop Destiny. Maybe Bungie now is able cover that part without a Publisher (most likely Bungie can). 
---
My main concern is why Activision was willing to leave Destiny to Bungie. Maybe the game performed that bad that it wasnt worth to be supported anymore. Maybe Activision is glad to get rid of the IP. Or maybe Bungie got the IP based on a compensation agreement. It is really hard to tell what happened and what it means for the future.
---
One major concern might be how Bungie is going to publish future content on PC. Will they somehow continue to use Battlenet or will they use something else?
---
Right now there is not enough information to give clear answers.
---
A tip if you are the Volundr forge (the first one), if you are queue'ing with randoms tell them to stay in the cave area. When you are all together it's much easier, and the caves are the ideal place because there is a lot of cover. Clear enemies as much as you can, if they stack up it's gonna be a lot harder. Also use Whisper of the Worm for the boss if you have it.
---
I completed my first forge when I was about 630 power level, it takes time but it's possible :) 
---
Message me if you're on PC and on Europe servers, i'm down to help you out for a few runs.
---
Yea, there was a popup message recently saying that
---
damn I'm just waiting for strange terrain to come back. How many runs did you do until it dropped?
---
Looks more like the guy is lagging. But I could be wrong about this, since they are using One eyed in gambit.
---
I've been doing that for a while now man. I think it's pure rng tbh.
---
Thanks for the tips) Unfortunately I still don't have the Worm sniper, but I'll try to get it.
---
Lol, yeah. That was me and now more than 100 matches (I think) later at glory 0, 67% HC kill count lol. 
---
I was with some guys and they were killing adds to farm heavy ammo as long as you keep killing the blues the time never runs out. 
---
New raid robes.
---
And last winter festival helmet.
---
I looked at this like wtf? Then i saw it üòÇ
---
I already play D2 at launch and played all DLC and content up to Fosaken which I could not pick because i was abroad.
---
You must be the first person ever that I've heard of that actually chooses to use Peacekeepers. Not trying to be a dick haha, it just surprised me. Glad it works for you:).
---
I'm personally not the best sniper and the only smg I like, especially for PvE, is the Huckleberry with catalyst. No reloading involved.
---
So you were getting upgrades. 
---
Lol. Yes, if they are building up, I will go dunk them! They may have been farming a bounty or something. There are some bounties that require just killing things in the forges with various weapons. Or they may have been working on weapon frames. 
---
Yeah i missed out on the first winter festival gear as in didn't bother on my warlock. That gear set is pointless now so lucky in a way. 
---
If you're on pc I plan on launching shattered throne before the reset, I could use some help with it
---
It‚Äôs called the vex mythoclast, obtained from the very first raid in the game, the vault of glass on hard mode and it was only a slight chance that it would drop.
---
It‚Äôs had quite the History from being the most broken thing I‚Äôve ever seen when it first came out  (55 in the mag and 4 shot headshot people) to a slightly toned down version after a couple of nerfs. It‚Äôs still a fantastic gun and one of my all time favourite guns in video games.
---
Is your nat Moderate or Strict? You can check in the menu, the last tab I believe. My brother has a moderate nat and he often doesn't get matched with other players.
---
&gt;That platforming was a bitch. 
---
That's putting it lightly imo
---
My titan looks aMaZiNg whatchu on abouttttt
---
Alright I'll make sure to have a look next time I'm on. 
---
Just like every other solo player ever? Yes you were right, I don't care about this facebook tier shitpost.
---
The shotgun will drop after you finish the lvl 7 boss and not the chest.
---
So what i suggest doing is get a group/friends and start grinding. Also if you get to lvl 7 and complete it you can go again and it will start at lvl 6.
---
No, I mean in adventure. But I guess that's a no.  
---
Thanks anyways.
---
I have a second but never play him. I do all the activities and I only bump up a couple of light levels every week. 
---
That‚Äôs fair enough, just the first time I have seen it and have been smashing the forges trying to get that damn rare bounty, without luck might I add üò°
---
One without One-eyed mask /s
---
Nothing is more epic than jumping up and casting Chaos Reach or Nova Bomb.
---
lul? you should really stop that bullshit
---
That's...impossible! - Asher Mir
---
What shader are you using on that Armor?
---
Fun fact every single efficiency higher than 0 is positive lol just whether it's above 1.0
---
Almost. I don't have black armory; cape is Last Wish. 
---
Yup. Atmosphere, raids, weapons, PvP maps, gear and soundtrack were all more memorable than D2. I miss the old tower :( 
---
Not helping that‚Äôs for sure
---
Lol same thing right? üòÇü§£
---
He was at least killing a lot of things I guess
---
I peeped that SAO opening, wonderful choice. The anime may not be great but the soundtrack is def a good listen.
---
Never had a problem going positive in pvp... Even when I was lvl 10 with shittiest gear out there.
---
I hit 650 without raids too and it wasn't really that hard. Just play about 8 - 10 hours a day and you'll be fine.
---
Still dreaming city, so yes. ~20% damage increase if your entire set is from the city or raid
---
Damn I should have picked the third option of bad reading. Pointing out that you are wrong about needing to invade for malfeasance in no way shows a desire to abuse anything. I've never vote kicked anyone in any game for anything other than trolling or being afk. I've only wished for it in this game for people sitting at the spawn point of a strike or gambit afk. 
---
First light. Best map Destiny has ever made
---
Man i miss my vex ghallafate hammer so much
---
Yeah when I get the entire Reverie Dawn set I'm probably gonna use it for raiding since it has the Riven's Curse de/buff. 
---
God I miss this game...
---
Ok my apologies. It looked as if you advocated kicking bad players. 
---
Cape is last wish?? 
---
That's it, playing interceptor wars (or cat and mouse) was hilarious in private games (and when it was in rotation) 
---
How does it go so fast
---
Nice, gratz!
---
It drops from the raid 
---
This is why I only gambit in a full stack. Makes for a much more enjoyable time for everyone on my team. 
---
I've been trying to solo the last part, but it seems impossible. 
---
Yes. Wait until you start getting Max level stuff then infuse it into your best lower level stuff
---
the mountain top...it is the pvp grenade launcher pinnacle weapon
---
Yes
---
I found that too üòÇ
---
I'm came to destiny after years in World of Warcraft which have vote kick system.
---
Players will abuse it..., everywhere all the time. You have luck that there are not that many casuals in destiny community so your case doesn't happen very often. It's certainly didn't happen to me.
---
Wish I had friends playing. All of them are Blizz elitist who hate D2 because it's not a Blizz title. 
---
No source but on Reddit
---
Iirc the report system literally sends nothing, empty space. Hence the number of options
---
My reply was focused on your ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt do that because this will happen‚Äù part of the post. I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre being so toxic. What I posted was why it shouldn‚Äôt happen. Bungie need to get better at identify AFKers and there are other ways to decide if someone is AFK or not. There‚Äôs a reporting system and it should be used to better effect. 
---
Seriously mate - chill. 
---
It‚Äôs in the ramen shop, I had just found it as well when I made this screenshot. 
---
Had to look real hard graphically to tell it apart from D2
---
I don't think it has anything to do with the whisper
---
I didnt find it particularly hard to get to 650 on all 3 characters without raiding myself.
---
Noted.
---
I've done the full quest yesterday. The crucible part was not that hard. bring up a handcannon, play defensively and try to shoot the head, that's it. Don't switch weapons. It is more a game of patience than anything else. Roaming around with a shitty revolver and getting raped by Thunderlords and shotguns is not fun.
---
Personnaly i've done 8 free for all and that was it.
---
Everyone sitting together is great, but the local chat totally makes this for me. 
---
+1
---
Flicks the ashes (radiant seeds) away
---
i just use that rock on the right and ramp that bitch in there
---
Why shouldn‚Äôt it happen???? There‚Äôs absolutely no reason why it SHOULDN‚ÄôT happen, you are stating it as if bungie is restricted to releasing a vote kick system without a requirement for the vote kick in place. The reporting system and the afk detections are way too easily bypassed, obviously bungie can‚Äôt do their ‚Äúpolice‚Äù work well enough, so allow us guardians to do what they can‚Äôt. We are literally volunteering to help unpaid. Actually we paid them.
---
Yes there is

I'm a Blizz fan myself, but I remind them WoW is currently hot trash, Overwatch is stale and HotS is dead. 
---
Ye I'm going to try again tonight with my mate. Otherwise it's a 3-week wait for me :)
---
p.s I'm not too proud to LFG, just too lazy
---
What's a charfe? 
---
Thanos?
---
I feel this. My first match was .14. Played crucible for ten straight hours while staying at a friend's house, then I finally had to sleep. Woke up, played for a few more, and suddenly could go positive. I almost maxed valor rank before heading home.
---
Honestly somewhere towards the beginning. I‚Äôm mostly a solo player since my schedule doesn‚Äôt line up with any of my friends that I would play with. I am on the brave glory step which is probably like the second or third one?
---
????
---
I started the game late november via the free battle.net offer, and am already 615.  It's pretty easy if you just keep grinding away at powerful gear and pvp stuff.    I do gambit mostly.
---
I don't feel like assault rifles are viable in this meta, am I wrong?  
---
Yes we do. Thats the only armor i want. I WANT TO BE FLUFFEH SIBERIAN BEAR
---
And I thought I was lucky when I got two skyburner's oath catalysts.
---
I don't have geomags lol
---
‚ÄúGambit Forge‚Äù ???
---
I tried to have some fun with sunbreaker today, but no, sentinel it is. Way too many warplocks and infiniteblades.
---
Put it this way. 
---
Curse of Osiris and Warmind was cut content that shouldve been part of vanilla D2. Sure it was the deadline that caused this but Bungie were the ones that rebooted D2 halfway through development causing them to not meet the release deadline.
---
The lack of Content in both Curse and Warmind was also down to Bungie. 
---
Like, maybe in curse they didn't have time but they had months and months to work on Warmind and that DLC literally lasted 5 hours max. 
---
Bungie isn't nearly as innocent as people are making them out to be and the only problem Activision were was the deadlines and annual release times. 
---
But hey, Activision is gone now. There is no scapegoat anymore. If Bungie fuck up again, they can't blame anybody but themselves this time. 
---
Thank you 
---
Breakneck has legit become my fave gun for PvE. It‚Äôs worth the grind
---
I‚Äôm sorry, this might come across as rude, but do you see the title of this subreddit?
---
Yeah but for that you need three teammates.
---
Go to the LFG discord.  The jumping puzzle is the easy part IMO.  The fights are the hard part.  Watch some youtube videos, it's surprisingly easy once you see someone else do it.
---
It wasn‚Äôt fantastic it was fucking broken
---
I‚Äôm in barest to say at the very beginning. Being a solo player new schedule doesn‚Äôt line up with anyone sucks. I‚Äôve been watching some YouTube or‚Äòs been trying to improve myself so I can be a good team player so that I could tackle it one day.
---
I ended up getting a rare drop this evening. Sure easy enough,
---
"Throw batteries at the forge to charge it. 0/50"
---
That's not throw 50 batteries... That's throw 20 batteries, 50 times.
---
If that's the case then Bungie needs to implement it, especially as the head guys in Bungie have talked about it before publicly. Cross-save seriously needs to come sooner rather than later tho as I am close to abandoning my Xbox and fully migrating over to PC, and without cross-save I might end up leaving Destiny behind
---
I've been kicked for winning the roll on a low level alchemy recipe in WoW before. I don't think the Destiny system would be abused as much, personally. AFK players plague Srikes, Gambit and Comp. It's really needed.
---
Well I don‚Äôt blame them. Gambit sucks 
---
No... more of a heads up warning.
---
True, but r/fireteams exists, as does lfg, as do clans.
---
As much as finding new teammates can be awkward, since I've done it my enjoyment of the game has grown exponentially.
---
Having a consistent group to play with if an evening is awesome 
---
I feel your pain, I've had this every time I've tried to do a Forge mission. Always a guy with 227 light who is AFK in a 600+ light activity wearing a chicken mask from the Festival event. How does he even stay in the queue for these missions when he's doing absolutely NOTHING? I played 4 different matches and he was in all 4 of them. I really hope my AFK reports do something because wow I was salty.
---
Unfortunately I didn't have a choice in the matter. It all just failed at once lol
---
I‚Äôve been wondering, what‚Äôs so special about the Niobe Labs Ghost? 
---
Vote kick gets abused... every time, everywhere i have seen it.
---
Sim seed exchange, Spider, breaking shit you don‚Äôt need that will drop them. The regular shit. 
---
Nope changes haven't been made yet.
---
That's just people backing out at the last moment.
---
There is no fast and specific way of farming them now, it's all just rng? 
---
i see where your coming from. if you like snipers maybe bows might be a better option? also i think the best way to deal with shot guns is to always move back and shoot while they try to charge you. 
---

---
Like everything but the legs,  I always did hate the shorts over armor look on mine.  Got the new raid ones with distribution a few weeks ago and they completed the look. 
---
 That cloak is alright,  I rock the tangled web and love it,  but my gear is almost white,  and it blends the spider mark well. I am not sure there is a shader that could do it for black. 
---
It‚Äôs a strategy to get more time. You get more time added by killing the blue guys than actually throwing the balls. It allows for more time to kill the enemies. That way you have all the balls to throw to finish off the round at once. 
---
Spider bounties. 
---
Can confirm it does, I was afk for about 50 games and got permanently banned from the game.
---
As soon as I saw the Mythoclast, "Yup, this clip is gonna be crazy."
---
Did not disappoint. 
---
Actually sounds like your whining  because you don't have everything, while you cant/won't bother the learn the game.
---
Heard rumors of d3 having a choice of light or dark.
---
Thats why nobody ever goes there
---
Considering raids are only cosmetic now it‚Äôs not that hard
---
Dunno what platform you're playing on but it's been really easy to find people to play with on the LFG Discord server for PC, plenty of people on both regions. I'm sure there must be one for PS4 and Xbone too but I haven't looked into it.
---
At least those work together and have SOME use, 
---
Wow!!
---
Well for that you only need vote kick when afk, because otherwise player would kick out even Zalava from the tower if they could. 
---
She deserves them more than you
---
I created a Warlock for Well Of Radiance **and** Chaos Reach, both are awesome in different ways for PVE B-)
---
I miss D1 crucible, d1 is shit with only 2 shot gun bullets, reduced mele range on the warlock, and shitty new supers imo. 
---
It pains me seeing how much super energy you get after a kill...
---
Please tell me you‚Äôre being sarcastic with this comment.  Please don‚Äôt ever ask someone to link their stats like it proves something.  
---
Question will my quest disapear at the end of the season
---
Holy, is there somewhere a link for buying this one?
---
Wait you can still play D1? Gotta start looking for a 360 unless it‚Äôs backwards compatible 
---
I wish I had it
---
Probably just went to the restroom.
---
Two weeks tomorrow. 
---
i think you're both right. d1 got all the raids, crucible, story and just gameplay overall perfectly. while d2 did make it seem a little duller than d1 in terms of gameplay. but d1 didn't have as much customization options on anything except exotics and your character. but now in d2 we can change our ships, guns, sparrows, and characters colors. which leads to some pretty cool combinations. where d1 got things wrong d2 made better. though d2s gameplay is a little duller than d1. also crucible is an utter mess in d2 rn. 
---
I agree with you. D2 is fantastic - the only things I really miss are the crucible maps and the customizable subclass trees. 
---
It proves that people who cry about nova warp are the ones that post screenshots of them getting positive kd in quick play. Who don't know shit about something that is truly broken in this game
---
So happy to see fellow Guardians taking their education beyond knowing who to shoot and who not to shoot ‚ô•Ô∏è much respect
---
Get yourself a Huckleberry with a catalyst or a Crimson with a Catalyst. I personally prefer Crimson because Bad Juju was my #1 gun and Red Death was my #2 in D1, but I've heard good things about Huckleberry
---
If you equip Celestial Nighthawk after activating your super, you will have 6 shots, each of which will regenerate approximately 30% of the super. I use this technique in Crucible a lot.
---
From what I understand you only get Curated rolls from gold frames, so your first time completing that frame in a week. I have definitely seen people get curated rolls without activating maximum temper.
---
You gut shards tho...
---
Only roll I got came woth handling masterwork. Kind of a bummer, but still, better than nothing
---
Glad to hear the game has helped another person! Best wishes to you and your mother now. Keep your eyes up, Guardian. ‚ù§
---
sure, why not. You dont need any certain light level to work on triumphs
---
\*skating titan oneshotting two players in melee at once\* the only op thing is the mask!
---
yo give me some shards im broke
---
That's the thing. If you are bad, OEM does NOTHING for you. You have to win those one-on-ones and kill the first opponent who procd the mark. In the hands of a good player tho.......yea it's gonna be a rough day.
---

I'm not buying another Bungie Product unless they release the forsaken free. 
---
Still waiting for the Destiny 2 I paid $100.00+ for at pre-order like a sucker!
---
Geomags extends CR duration. As long as you are doing damage it lasts longer. How much longer? Way longer. Like kill a primeval with 3 stacks as long as hes tethered or melting point longer.
---
beat me to it... i was just finding the correct image!
---
So why can‚Äôt ur 447 Titan rip a black spindle or sleeper or 1k out of the collections? Last time I checked you could and it scaled to ur light minus 20
---
The hell
---
Yeah I got surround, rampage, and range.  Not a lot of synergy there.  Still looking for kill clip / rampage
---
Again people would kick other guys from gambit/pvp because they dont know how to play pvp or just bad at the game. We cant have votekick system because community is toxic.
---
I run Cayde's Cloak because it looks great and... y'know... Cayde... I pair it with all Last Wish gear except the gauntlets, those are Shards of Galanor.
---
I do the platforming for fun sometimes now. With lion rampants you can get through in like 3 mins. Such a great little activity.
---
"I'll burn you in my giant L√ÑMP"
---
It's a neat idea, and a good application of logic.
---
The problem is, most of the time the simplest answer is the right one. They needed a neat name for the buff and went with something that sounded positive and is forge related, is what I'd bet on.
---
Destiny 2 isnt Pay 2 Win.
---
i am still using my Graviton Lance and Huckleberry, Luckly i got and completed the Catalyst for huckleberry last night, and have had the Graviton for a long time
---
i do not think either requires any DLC
---
Why are you working on triumphs if ur severely under levelled for half of them?
---
I don't care much about the level but damn do you have good taste in shaders and armour!
---
It's simple enough to get Max Temper, but I think you might be grasping.   That said I'll bite, just for luck.
---
***Immigrant Song Intensifies***
---
Did they buff it?  Last time I got ionic return, it did like 180ish, which left them with barely any health.
---
Yep, it's only a prototype and it does not count for any of the mission that says "do sth with at least a Black Amory weapon equipped."
---
Fighting lion is low key really really good.
---
Yeah
---
I am talking pve, not pvp. I got one too with surrounded and found that when the perk actually procs, I'm already working with my threat level.
---
I ( not on purpose ) blamed 1 company
---
And I‚Äôm pretty sure the solution I provided was to work on matchmaking...
---
big woooooshhhh
---
By the time surrounded procs, you should be using a shotgun ;)
---
Took me 4-5 runs about 2 weeks ago lol
---
Lol yea my k.d is attrocious
---
It doesn't help that as a solo player, most supers are not counterable. Not even a headshot from the highest impact sniper will stop a super with damage resistance. In D1 supers had a lot of potential but you could be stopped if you didn't use the super right/somebody outplayed you w a sniper or something while in D2 its essentially just free kills.
---
As everyone else said it's personal preference. I can tell you the curated roll of the gun comes with dragonfly and rampage. I have those specs on a non curated drop and I can say it's pretty fun.
---
Thank you Kanye, very cool 
---
Kill clip one.  Rampage one is ok for pve so keep them both.
---
Such a better game.  The feel,  the looks,  the map design.  Just better all around.  How they changed how the game felt never made sense to me.  The best feeling gun play ever sure let‚Äôs change that.  
---
Mercury is officially the worst flashpoint because I need to do a bunch of adventures just to unlock adventures for my other 2 characters 
---
How come you have your armor MW'd but not your weapons? lol
---
Im flabbergasted.
---
So the raids were not perfect right so we agree then. D1 right off the bat beat the D2 raids for the full year.
---
Forge 100 weapons, look for the triumph called "Master Smith" to see what progress you are out. 
---
the nova warp subclass attunement of fission can basically do the same thing though, a bodyshot from a 180rpm hc and a melee is enough to kill someone as their charged melee does 100+60 damage. for the record i play a titan but i don¬¥t shoulder charge everyone all the time like its the only button i can press. its a crutch and its easy to counter.
---
I got lucky and got it during a 100k run, which triggered me to go for the rest of wayfarer.
---
Yeah there‚Äôs not much to do without dlc you can probably try doing leviathan raid but other than that you will need to get forsaken and the other 2 expansions. You can buy forsaken and I believe the 2 other expansions come with forsaken
---
Hello r/boneappletea
---
Again with these d1 clips. Why do you put them on the one subreddit called destiny 2 instead of destinythegame
---
Yeah, this makes me die inside a bit
---
I had breakneck like a month+ ago and I'm still below 650. 
---
but does it work under-water?
---
i mean the puzzle it self was actually pretty simple when you step back but to blatantly pretend like the final clue was in fact the final clue and not mention its missing a string of text.. like im on board with the activity, i think its challenging and its not just a handout but why did it take 3 days to say "oops we forgot a string of code" ? like no one was watching the streams or saw that clue 7 was missing something.. lol thats what im saying shame on not the mission itself. 
---

##**NEED SOME NEW MOVES GUARDIAN? MAYBE A NEW LOOK?**
---
Leviathan is a year 1 raid know one is doing it. There are 2 newer raids. The Last Wish and Scourge of the Past. Last wish I would be no lower than 560 power, for the Scourge I would be no less than like 630 power. 
---
Damage of the perk was reduced while damage increases of other perks (kill clip/rampage) were increased. 
---
Oh I thought you were trying to talk about the fact that parts of what should be vanilla were cut and made into DLC (which was more of a d1 issue I think) but now I see what you're saying. I think if you put "with **a** year until release" it would help a lot but it's mostly on me for not understanding what you were mentioning. Also it's less scrap and more like redo but I guess that's neither here nor there. 
---
and you didn't lock it? madman...
---
I'm finishing up the riskrunner one right now. Looking forward to that range buff!! Riskrunner is so good in the fallen forges!!
---
Yo how many warlocks we got? Quick switch to sunsinger! Ah shit James lagged out
---
look all im saying is that if the vex mythoclast doesnt come back, this season pass was not worth it 
---
use gloves with enhanced hand cannon loader from the raid or dreaming city, they help alot
---
When people leave though other people who are currently matchmaking will also join so usually you'll always have someone. There will be plenty of chances later on to do difficult missions solo if that's what you're trying to wonder 
---
I mean if #4 is constantly invading, dying and losing motes like it's going out of fashion then I think that's a valid use of a vote kick.
---
It‚Äôs ok, dude. We all make mistakes. My last one got a bit of heat for mistakes. Also, I agree that the D1 situation was a mess of greed.
---
Now you just have to do the heroic version to get the catalyst and then complete it to make it 10x better. 
---
Love my ASTRO A10's, and Destiny, a great combo
---
About 3 days ago?  Doing the Blind Well event.  Took maybe..five?  tries.  I wasn't really counting.
---
You hit the nail on the head with the frustration thing. I'm such a regular loser (at gaming I mean, lol!) That I normally don't play very long; I'll just switch off after a half hour or so because I get bored of failing. Frustration definitely gets the better of me.
---
The few times that I'm on, I just hang in the tower because I feel I'll do no good to anyone out there at the moment. I've been trying to get familiar with the controls by kicking around the big purple bouncy ball (which hurt my heart to see deflated in the beginning of D2 LOL!) but, of course, that's not gonna beat actually going in there and playing the damn game so....\*sigh\* you're right. I just gotta bite the bullet, go out there and do the thing!
---
Thank you so much fellow hunter! I really appreciate your help!!!
---
Nice one cheers
---
&gt; There will be plenty of chances later on to do difficult missions solo if that's what you're trying to wonder 
---
This is exactly what I was trying...thanks!
---
Soo many masterworks, you beautiful crazy bastard. üòò
---
I can not tell you how many times I have encountered this.
---
AAAEUGHEUAEUHG.
---
Not hating on D2 but d1 maps were a lot better 
---
My guardian kills were mainly trying to defend our primevil and mote invasions. I was then too late invading their primevil as they managed to kill it as I started killing them. I definitely could‚Äôve done better though, just shed a tear tbh lmao
---
Thank you so much
---
That's my point... if it's going to use cores it needs an effect that is actually worth using cores on.
---
There is a discord server dedicated to finding groups to do stuff with on PC. Here is a join link: https://discord.gg/fxPTAw
---
There are still tons of people who do Leviathan. The reason there is no matchmaking for raids is that they have complicated mechanics that require teamwork, and randomly matched groups seldomly have any teamwork to speak of. 
---
F
---
Congrats! I started the game from the PC giveaway in November and I just got my first 650 weapon last night! I‚Äôm almost there too! 
---
At least you know youll get it...
---
Hard cap refers to the maximum it is possible to reach. Soft cap refers to the part where it gets much harder to increase your power level. 
---
You have the best emote in the game feels good.
---
I know it's on the roadmap but I don't remember exactly. Some time in March.
---
But the cosmetic is from niobes torment? What's wrong with it having specific perks
---
I would recommend gringing to get your light up to max before buying the DLC.  Also, if you haven't created your alt characters you may want to do that.  Having 3 characters helps increase your light faster once they can all use your highest level weapons.
---
To increase light:  do your daily/weekly power engram activities.  
---
Flashpoint (resets weekly)
---
Daily Heroic Advenure on the Flashpoint planet (resets on a 4 day rotation)
---
Ikora Daily Missions (resets on a 4 day rotation)
---
Daily Gambit (resets on a 4 day rotation)
---
Daily Crucible (resets on a 4 day rotation)
---
Weekly Gambit (3 matches)
---
Weekly Gambit Bounty 
---
Weekly Crucible (5 matches)
---
Ikora Weekly (20 bounties completed)
---
Weekly Nightfall
---
Weekly Nightfall Score run
---
Riads (Each boss drops power level gear for the first completion on a character type each week) Leviathan was recommended 280 before Forsaken.
---
Wife him.
---
Surrounded is actually trash on kindled. Tried it even in bergusia. You have to be too close to proc it so I deleted this exact rolls. I prefer my outlaw/rampage KO until I receive the coveted kill clip/rampage
---
Honestly, the puzzle was completed I think the day after they opened up the Forge it was intended to unlock. It's not so much that people \*couldn't\* finish it, it's that everyone was expecting it to take far less time and Bungie wasn't expecting it to take so long. It was the longest running piece of content the franchise has seen, in terms of being uncompleted. All the raids were beaten in far less time, for example. 
---
As far as the publisher leaving, the consensus has been that Activision has been unhappy since the rocky launch of D2, which was mired in controversy after controversy (microtransactions, unsatisfying expansions etc.), and with the financial performance of the Forsaken expansion in general. In terms of player count and satisfaction, it's never been better. But publishers don't care about that; they just want all the money immediately, even at the cost of player goodwill.
---
I don't remember exactly but it's some time in March. Its on the roadmap Bungie has posted in their TWABs
---
im not crying and welcome guardian and join the hunters they the best
---
Yeah,  kind of a "no shit answer", but i did ask so im probably the dumb one. Thanks for the reply.
---
Can u only run shattered throne once per chara?
---
I‚Äôve got one with outlaw &amp; rampage. 
---
Rampage x3 for dayssssssss üôåüèº
---
**he** ***protec***
---
I do take it into account, so thanks for the answer!
---
Me me me me me me me!!!!
---
True. Things like no actual matchmaking in PvP and a story not worth following was entirely Bungie's doing. The former especially pisses me off because of the incredibly idiotic decision to lock some gear behind not only playing PvP, but **consistently winning** in it.
---
But there's a chance that they'll actually do something about it because Activision is really shit at letting developers make changes to things (see the CoD series). Will they though? Who knows.
---
This is more cringey than anything
---
Unless you are Gearbox working on ALIENS Colonial Marines...
---
thanks
---
you misspelled everywhere but pvp
---
I‚Äôd like one 
---
HAHAHA Titan with one-eyed-mask the pure fucking hilarity that the douche meta kid is the AFK one. 
---
It works by clicking the 3 dots in the corner of the subreddits page. At least on mobile
---
Not sure then, the 3rd is obtainable via raid or offering as people have said. Lucky you i guess
---
Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but didn‚Äôt Bungie have to step in to help with level 6 since nobody could get it without a hint? That‚Äôs mainly what caused the controversy. I love Destiny but you can‚Äôt defend that, when the devs themselves have to step in to give hints and the players couldn‚Äôt do it themselves that shows bad game design!
---
And yes I‚Äôm well clued up about it all, I‚Äôm referencing someone who hasn‚Äôt kept up with anything related to it and doesn‚Äôt know about the troubles. From their fresh eyes all they see is the publisher leaving. If I just started playing a game and saw that it‚Äôs publisher just split up with the devs I‚Äôd be confused and worried for the game!
---
The depressing thing is that 150rpm scout rifles and pulse rifles in general are better sniper rifles than actual sniper rifles. Izagnami might become one of the few viable snipers now because as a sniper with a decent HSR (46%+ in games without D2‚Äôs insane bullet magnetism), sniper rifles are just gimping yourself so hard when you compare them to a scout/pulse + shotgun/backup plan fusion.
---
The arms are leviathan too aren‚Äôt they? Grips of the Ace-Defiant
---
Forsaken includes all prior DLCs,  but the first expansion in the Annual Pass launched some time ago. Just note that you shouldn‚Äôt purchase the Annual Pass unless you‚Äôve reached the endgame of Forsaken, mainly around 610+ power level
---
I‚Äôm not sure that you can anymore. There‚Äôs a couple other scannables in the Tower that are outdated so it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if they never bothered to make that one scannable when they put in the Drifter.
---
Loot only applies once per character meaning you only get 3 chances every 3 weeks for the ship to drop.
---
Awesome, finished up mine this morning with a chill group of LFGers. 
---
Yea 3 week cycle is so bs atleast whisper is more feasible
---
&gt; Again people would kick other guys from gambit/pvp because they dont know how to play pvp
---
Yesssss this is great though. That guy going 2 - 15 in competitive clash? Bye felicia. 
---
Ya... would depend where you looked. These things are only documented as they are discovered in the game so this third source wasn‚Äôt known until 3 weeks after the other two when it became full curse week for the first time. 
---
Wherever you read was probably from between when people got the one from Last Wish and this. 
---
Do exotics just drop from Forge completions? Or do you need to be working on a frame?  
---
I ran Bergusia a couple times without frames and got nothing but blues. 
---
The one with Rangefinder for sure.
---
Kill clip is better for pve as you get more kills easily.
---
Well since nighthawk only adjust your super timer, not the bullet number, if you don‚Äôt use the glitch then you can get more than 6 kills, but you have to pull it off in the small timeframe the super normally has. But if you use the glitch, then theoretically you could never run out of either.
---
It‚Äôs only a waste if they aren‚Äôt used imo.  I‚Äôm sittting on over 300 of them.
---
Gateway between worlds is the bounty for the offering to the oracle. He‚Äôs talking about getting the third one from the chest when you go see Mara on full curse week. 
---
Honestly, I didn't keep up with it all that much, since I was working I figured I'd just follow a guide after it was all done. If Bungie did have to step in for it to be solved at all then I agree, it's a badly designed puzzle.
---
As for the Activision thing, I don't know if you saw my Edit before replying but I thought I was replying to someone on the Humans Being Bros subreddit where I saw this get reposted from, not on the D2 subreddit. I must've clicked the wrong link and didn't realise until after. Again, I entirely agree. I was more trying to explain it for people outside the loop than anything else.
---
I got another fusion rifle yesterday with the exact same rolls that I got it with last time. Even the same masterwork and I just looked at them, with tears in my eyes.
---
he attac 
---
I have been summoned
---
I don‚Äôt mind it being locked behind content, it makes it more rewarding to complete it. It‚Äôs more the content is only available once every 3 weeks which I personally feel takes away from it if the luck isn‚Äôt on your side for getting a rare bounty. It‚Äôs not like I can sit and grind it 9 hours a day for the next week to finish the quest as like I said before, the next step is locked for 3 weeks. 
---
Fuuuuccckkkk.
---
Nobody making a Kinderguardian joke? ^(yes I know they are all lvl 50)
---
nah
---
Your loss.
---
Your right, I just go into quick play to get a break from that. I‚Äôm not hating. 
---
It includes three smaller dlc that release this year. The first of which out now is Black Armoury and the other two upcoming are Joker‚Äôs Wild and Penumbra. 
---
They say to wait because you can‚Äôt access anything in Black Armoury until you are over 600 power so can keep an eye open for sales on the annual pass and make up your mind if you want to buy it while you work on getting up to that point with just Forsaken. 
---
Yes, yes it doed
---
So think of it as a random drop exotic. You can‚Äôt farm a quest for those either, just gotta get lucky. I‚Äôd bet there will still be people 3 weeks from now with no rare bounty complaining that they have to wait again. That‚Äôs RNG man! 
---
I think you mean Waluigi‚Äôs Shader.
---
Kings fall raid set was so good. 
---
So was trials in D1
---
Don't be blinded by nostalgia. I loved D1 to death, but man did it have its flaws. And D2 in its current state is actually a really fantastic game
---
Keep ranting about getting teabagged kid. You're funny and entertaining. 
---
Wow, right on. Welcome!!!
---
I feel you man. This is the first time i have reached max light.
---
Aahh, I always get that generally. Neat
---
That's where i was having trouble. Trying to memorize the letters locations. But good ol' trust came in.
---
Congrats but what‚Äôs up with that grey pistol. Is it OP? 
---
I know, imagine if people complained about Wish Ender!
---
I think the main reason people are mad about this quest, but not others that require you to wait like Whisper or Wish Ender, is because they want to be done with it *right now,* since it was not initially clear that this quest would require Shattered Throne, and this week is Shattered Throne week. They feel their opportunity slipping away. 
---
Get more friends lol
---
Not at all. Nothing wrong with a long quest, every other exotic quest is long. The problem is that it is rng and time gated. Both together make for a nasty combo. There isn't much else in the game that is rng and time gated, and if there is, it feels just as bad.
---
So what if people complain about everything? That doesn't mean you should disregard all complaints. That is actual delusion. How will you know a valid complaint when you see one?
---
Also, forever 319 in that era.
---
I just keep it there, for old times sake
---
You have hit the nail on the head there with me, I‚Äôve got a quest in my pursuits that I can‚Äôt do for 3 weeks and it‚Äôs gonna drive me nuts üòÇ
---
I would focus mainly on campaign as you go but basically just keep doing anything you meet the recommended level for as it unlocks. 
---
You can delete most things you don‚Äôt like as you go but I would try lots of things out. Also, always hold onto your highest power gear in every slot. You don‚Äôt necessarily have to equip it but shouldn‚Äôt delete anything until you get a higher power drop to replace it. 
---
The game bases your drops off of the highest power level that character is able to equip to so you want to keep that up as high as you can to keep your overall progression going. 
---
So just play the game? Thanks.
---
And masterworked your gear üí™üí™ well done Guardian 
---
Unless you've got gwisin vest then yeah pretty much
---
And you don't give gun name? 
---
Is than an orchid?
---
I guess you could say they fell for it.
---
thats we he said
---
I have a helmet that has Light Reactor (gain super energy on fusion rifle kills) and I love pairing that with the Telesto. Only problem is I miss out on having my Queenbreaker for invades and counter-invades. I'm looking for a replacement fusion rifle. Would you say this fusion is good for add clearing?
---
Dude this happens to me but with worldline zero
---
U got till tomorrow
---
Actually the curated raid roll is one of the best guns in the crucible rn. It melts everything.
---
Show me where they said that at the outset of the quest...and then where they said it at any point after.
---
You set the expectation it should be done in a week, they never did....you just decide to blame them for YOUR expectations because they didnt hold your hand and reveal everything upfront...tell me how fair that is.
---
Accountability is a thing....
---
If it is a regular strike, generally no biggie as they get filled back up fairly quick.
---
I‚Äôll never forget the day I rented The Mummy on VCR when it first came out. Shit was scary lol.
---
Guys I had to get groceries in
---
Til reset Tuesday.  Then the Shattered Throne will be back 3 weeks from then.  
---
So buy it ?
---
His packages tend to have more in them. Quite often you'll get two legendaries instead of one. At least that's what I've gathered from this
---
The real answer: We do not know, because we don't know exactly which decisions were Bungies and which were Activisions. What we do know is that bungie now has *more* control, which could mean good things if they were the "good guys." I'm inclined to believe they will make more consumer friendly decisions than activision.
---
It is? I have over 4.5k of them
---
Which means your weapons are higher level than your armor. So the weapon that dropped will be higher than the rest of your gear, but it won‚Äôt be higher than the weapon you have equipped. If you would have got a piece of armor at that level, it would have raised your overall light level. Just RNG on if you get a weapon, or piece of armor. If your 3 equipped weapons are all higher than your armor, then you most likely won‚Äôt rank up at all unless you get armor.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt be too worried about it. There‚Äôs lots of solo/matchmade content that can get you to 600+ and plenty of people will take you lower for a lot of things. 
---
It was a bit slower getting from 500 to 520ish but things speed up after that getting into dreaming city, nightfalls, etc. 
---
Prime engram drop rates have also been jacked up to make the climb from 500 to 600 faster from just doing pretty much anything. They are just random drops and occur more often until you hit 600 to help people catch up. 
---
You won‚Äôt be able to do the forges and Black Armoury content until you are over 600 but there is lots of end game from Forsaken to be done between there that is still all completely relevant to the game so there won‚Äôt be any shortage of people to play with on all of that stuff. 
---
I'll take one!
---
One eyed mask?
---
Huh, I had no idea.
---
Wasn‚Äôt really tying to come off like that. I ran this frame 70 times so it wasn‚Äôt like a one time deal. Got this and rampage/outlaw, killclip/rampage. Those were the best 3 but out of those this one is just unreal and would highly recommend it to people in the community. And yes it‚Äôs a Kindled Orchid. 
---
Lol. Texas A&amp;M.
---
That's all I'm saying. üòÇüòÇ
---
You get Wish-Ender from Shattered Throne. Shattered Throne is available for the entirety of the third week of the curse. You can tell which week it is by what the Dreaming City looks like. [Here is an album of screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/U3CvlXm) comparing the first and third weeks. If you don't want to physically travel there, look at where Petra is. 
---
The Strand: First, least cursed week
---
Divalian Mists: Second, middle week
---
Rheasilvia: Third, most cursed week.
---
This is a crosspost, the original post was made by someone else :)

Love playing with the fighting lion. got the catalyst to work on right now, but man does it one shot kill like every mob
---
Blind squirrel finds an acorn every now and then. They've been in the SEC 7 years, they were bound to sneak a win against us eventually.
---
That Warlock totally looks like "Give me all your Exotics and *maybe* I won't Nova Warp you repeatedly.
---
Except now Netease owns a majority stake in Bungie - you know, the Chinese mobile game developer that fleeces people with no self control through mind boggling amounts of microtransactions?
---
Yeah... something to celebrate!
---
In short no kinetics have dragonfly outside ace of spades.

In long: dragonfly only operates on energy weapons since there is no option for a kinetic explosion.

I have outlaw and triple tap on my Duke. Its baller as hell. I would like that roll on a higher RPM hand cannon though.

Aye lad remember, you always got us on your side. Behind the screens we're all people. If you need us we'll be here.
---
Solo-ing a nightfall depends on a few things;
---
1. Nightfall Level choice (3 choices each week)
---
2. Character choice (My choice: Hunter-Nightstalker-top tree) w/rigs
---
3. Weapon choice (High dps options like ARs)
---
4. The chosen level's "quickest" path (watch speedruns for each nightfall level)
---
5. Five of Swords Modifiers (For quick runs, use Heavyweight + elemental singe or your choice)
---
You can actually choose from three different nightfalls each week. With the right tools and knowledge, the nightfall's 540 light level requirement is pretty easy to manage solo even at lower lights like in the 530 ranges. Most nightfalls do not actually require the player to kill all (or sometimes any) of the enemies in a room. Usually, you can just bull run to the end of each room, defeating only enimies that will advance each encouter. Watching youtube videos on pros running through each level helps immensely. Also, if the nightfall's score doesn't matter to you, then you can take as much time as needed (hours if need be!). Lastly, the five of swords challenge card (you can get it for free from Xur) makes things much easier if you are just interested in grabbing that weekly completion engram. Grab the card, slap on solar singe, heavyweight, and go to town with the sleeper/whisper of the worm.
---
Source: Hundreds of hours wasted on this game. 
---
WHAT DO I DO WITH THIS INFORMATION?!?!
---
Just unlucky RNG basically. I‚Äôve had it happen a few times. Nothing to worry about though, grind for that next powerful or prime Engram üëçüèª
---
I have the exact same thing!! Good shit man
---
Lol amen I don't know why all these fanboys are just glossing over this. If anything the games about to get 10x worse. 
---
No one complains about those? People complain about thousand voices every time you go into LW. I've also seen it a lot on this subreddit and I've only been here since last wednesday. You're not wrong about how they are the similar, but some are done poorly and some are not. This one was not executed well and then they shoved it in everyones face by making it a quest. Some players never do 'challenging' content like raids and such so it is not in their mind.
---
I'm not going to defend my actions or anything but tbf afk:ing 50 games is really fast since you will lose the games rather quickly.
---
Ah yes, Netease, "Do you guys not have phones?" the company. 
---
Chinese gaming companies make EA, Activision, etc look like saints. 
---
I got a rare quest to drop and it was the one from the forge, I am pretty sure they turned off all other rare quests now.  Used to get those like candy, and since my guild died and I hate pugging I probably wont' get this until they decide to come back to play the new raid.
---
Shaxx seems like the guy who only gets a hard on from watching Crucible during sex.
---
Eyes up Guardian! 
---
Ummm in that case one third of the dlc is sub par given there‚Äôs two more season and 4 exotic quests to come alongside multiple updates to gambit next season and unknown content the season after. I‚Äôm going to go out on a limb and say we shouldn‚Äôt judge the whole thing by one third of it.
---
I got it to drop during a nightfall after 600 hours. Then Xur sold it again a month or so before d2 came out. So I bought 2 more.
---
Gotcha, yeah it says Trials matches count, too, unfortunately Trials doesn't exist right now lol. I'll have to hop on lfg for a Nightfall I guess.
---
Black Hammer?  
---
Which platform? If PC, I can help change that
---
All forges we‚Äôre done at the Bergusia Forge üòû
---
How long does the whole thing take? 
---
No you can‚Äôt get forsaken gear outside cosmetics for locked forsaken weapons. The forsaken gear is exclusive to forsaken owners unless something major has changed. (This excludes random roll crucible things which you can get but can‚Äôt use until you have forsaken)
---
Why is your breakneck not kasterworked? It comes fully masterworked
---
lol it's not toxicity if you proclaim to be a gun guy then label 9mm as a rifle round ü§£üòÇ what a joke

You got the shards which I one of the 12 exotics I don't have For my hunter

There should one. Definitely
---
The sniper is eh at best. Not nearly as good as it seems on paper and it doesn‚Äôt even compete with whisper

Exactly!

Thunderlord though... i cri

Made me tear up.

Ive been playing since january first of year one. Been kicked from a few clans for calling people mentally disabled  and telling other people to slit their wrists (not even for being bad, just on discord). And if theres one thing ive learned, its that lions do not concern themselves with the opinions of sheep. Just take that voice inside your head that tells you to be tactful and understanding, and shoot it. Shoot it in the goddamn face. (Not an original quote, but you have no clue how much i wish i came up with it).
---
Lol use better wording in your post then. Don‚Äôt contradict yourself it with the title 
---
Congratulations 
---
[Right here](https://i.imgur.com/QDuM0Lz.png) brother
---
Congrats dude! It‚Äôs a big milestone to accomplish
---
I‚Äôve got one and my only dislike is I‚Äôve only got the zoom scopes and not the less intrusive scopes.
---
My outlaw rampage has the nice scopes and a range masterwork which is scary because of how it already has sniper range 
---
I‚Äôm sad I didn‚Äôt make my Lord scream :(
---
I can see from your name, I hate ash
---
Why because he doesnt spend every second of free time on this game? Or maybe he doesnt have free time to grind out as quickly? Its still an accomplishment
---
Great, now when I play gambit ill forever think of this. Made me laugh way to much lmao
---
Me too, me too
---
The remaining 2/3 better be really good if they are gonna save face
---
While this isn't how I run my clan at all, I can relate to having a lot of bad teammates, and calling my old clan leader out for being a tryhard. I got kicked, most of the server left with me, he now has noone to play with, a lot of stuff happens.
---
Get them weapon masterworks my man. Gratz though I'm currently stuck at 580 lol 
---
All 3 of the Mummy movies are on Netflix right now. Yes, even the third one.

I mostly go cav/fuze

I know! I was so excited, for 1 and 2, not so much 3 lol

It‚Äôs still a fun watch lol

If cross play comes out for Xbox and ps4 sometime ill take you through whatever you need Gaurdian (imNoodz)
---
You on xbox my dude? Need a clan?
---
Sorry if this was already answered lol, just trying to hook you up with some good folks
---
Ok?
---
Yes he should have 
---
At times you wonder  "how can i get anything donw while being solo" but soon after remember youre a rivens bane, and your biggest obstacle for other seals is rng.
---
Not the OP, I just crossposted
---
No I totally do, I think he‚Äôs a great actor
---
Aaah that‚Äôs great. Your last paragraph pretty much sums up the answer to my biggest worry about shelling out for Forsaken and the AP. Thanks a lot for your feedback.
---
Now on to look for a bundle for base game + DLCs on console.
---
Maybe 2-3 hours. It depends how fast/well you can do Shattered Throne. It is easier with a fireteam. 
---
BOO GET OFF STAGE!!!!
---
Jk thats cool
---
Good on you for not posting another salty wall of text about not getting IB. I‚Äôll be right there with ya in 3 weeks (or maybe even longer) finishing off that quest. 
---
BlyssBlack7 I'm on almost every day. Don't hesitate to ask for anything you need. 
---
I mean, I'm the top 50 in PvP, but I'd rather play with a bunch of mates and enjoy it than tryhard my life out in comp.
---
Honestly it felt like their struggle here lied with how they decided to implement a portion of the content and their overall quest design with izanagi. I‚Äôm all for the whole puzzle for aesthetics stuff and actually enjoyed a lot of the content including all the added activities. 
---
On the other hand they really should‚Äôve done some thinking about how the less engaged group would take it which overall led to a lot of backlash. The lockbox quest failed because it placed the THREE WEEK locked activity on a step after an entirely rng focused step. The bergusia forge worked in my eyes and would‚Äôve been fine if they hadn‚Äôt fucked their clues twice which led to longer periods, but it should‚Äôve been optional and given different rewards that wouldn‚Äôt have led to the decoupling 
---
Figured it would be, I think that's the only one that can roll like that. The Kill Clip Rampage is a fucking beast. I see some 45K crits on the Dreaming City. A HAND CANNON does 45K crits, it's insane
---
They should be double edged, maybe a boot knife design. Slightly enlarged.
---
Getting alot of those in strikes. Must feel really bad to get in your pvp team .. 
---
I‚Äôm more of a finka/chanka kind person 
---
How did they botch Niobe and why I‚Äôd BA terrible? 
---
it's a known glitch. If you have like any buff that makes you glow, it will show the glow effect in the scope, and you could barely see anything.
---
Eyes up guardian. 
---
Titan
---
Sentinel shield Titan is also a good one. Enemies drop like flies with the abilities that class has
---
You might run into a little trouble finding people willing to teach you the Raids but other than that it‚Äôs not hard to run the rest of the content. &amp; nothing is really relevant other than the Ikelos Shotgun from Warmind but I don‚Äôt really see people using it much now anyway because it received a small nerf. 
---
One day, my friend..
---
But you can settle for the forge shader too, right? That one looks nice, and i used it on the helmet
---
The first DLC was shit.
---
The game is getter now.
---
I got kill clip and rapid hit on my Duke. It kills
---
I just saying his best friend spent roughly $500 USD on a gift just to make sure they stay in touch. Probably not gay, but there's definitely some solid guy love right there. And I speak from experience. At the launch of D2 my best bro gave me a PS4, a year PS plus subscription and enough credit to buy the game, so we could play together throughout the week. We play D&amp;D every Saturday, but that's about it for either of our socializing so it was nice to be able to have something we could share.
---
Same I have 3 exotics drop in the last 2 weeks all dupes. I die a bit inside every time 
---
The moved the base strikes to their corresponding destinations. Click on a destination to find the strike you want. 
---
I got dragonly kill clip, but for once I dont like kill clip on a gun. If only this could roll with feeding frenzy with rampage, I'd never use another solar secondary
---
explain your pocket boop
---
ya for real I'm so scared that I'll find a better roll on armor or find a new build I like better, so masterworking armor isnt going to happen for me for quite a while 
---
First timer for me, and was carried by my clan. I could start a mine with all the salt produced that night
---
Not really, but Forsaken requires you to have them so I guess we have to deal.
---
They were fine, just not exceptional.
---
Feeding frenzy would be amazing. If only....
---
I never understood character names like OP‚Äôs. CosmicPigeon??
---
Here's something to try, hoarding keys i was on 17 completions with nothing. Once i started hoarding it feels like i had more chances at getting 1k. I hoarded 6 keys and used a FT medallion for good measure. It dropped on my 4th open üòÅ
---
Yeah, the forge ones are sweet. Just gotta get a bigger collection before I start using em. 
---
Heh, there is still a long way ahead of you gaki...    i mean fucking 24/7 grinds, exotics and other heavy shit, oh and don't forget to make two other characters to 650
---
Exactly 
---
true, but some people were able to activate kill trackers on any y2 weapons by using item manager to activate them, without exotic catalysts or masterworked legendaries. I have ace of spades, queenbreaker, and a handful of legendary guns with kill trackers. No orbs produced sadly :(
---
Hunter knives on top and bottom tree should be 1 hit kills
---
actually trackers come on level 6 and above, no need to go all the way to level 8
---
Maybe he is lagging "ahead of time" xD
---
Shoot I've had it since day 1 and I still don't have Wayfarer. I'm solo so I don't do Nightfalls or raids or run 3 characters so I don't have a lot of stuff. 
---
it's not breakneck, it's hazard of the cast because it doesn't have that leather strap
---
i have like 5 shards dupes, i'll trade you for a sixth coyote which is the only hunter exotic i need
---
gj bro 
---
Scarlet Witch or Vision as Warlock. Who would be a good hunter?
---
Rip man I got about 3 of the coyote!  I'll trade any day lol good shit man!  
---
500-600 is probably the easiest part of the power level grind because dreaming city gears, with a bit of luck, should bump you up by 10-20 a week. just do your powerfuls man, you'll be 650 in no time
---
Hey! Great job! Whats auto rifle are you using?
---
This is low effort/useless content.
---
Thanks.
---
Hunters are the best
---
lol no
---
Why did he deserve it he may have had a bullet on his back but that doesn‚Äôt mean he can‚Äôt go out with a fight and prove a point cayde didn‚Äôt deserve it because he was the only good character in this damn game and Bungie took him away
---
So, I went to a play in seattle with the original voice actor for osiris. This is back in D1. Throughout the whole play I felt like I knew his voice wayyyy too well. Looked at his credit on the poster for the play and he was the voice of osiris. In the play he was a false prophet conning these people. Never know what these voice actors do the rest of the time.
---
Wat.
---
So if I bring up power rangers , now it's a crossover between 4? Right. It's not a crossover just because it's brought up. Because there was no effort to actually cross the references.
---
No worries. I'll still be playing when you come on 
---
Some things can never be unseen. Thanks satan
---
i never want to see this format again
---
It's the Last Wish raid exotic. You only get one shot at getting it each week per character. 
---
Didnt titans also work with striker grenades? 
---
21 Prometheus catalyst
---
Rule Number 5 my dude.
---
U damn right I give him a platinum
---
Oh boy, the amazing Mythoclast, why can‚Äôt we have such great weapons as we did in D1.
---
Those were THE times when exotics REALLY felt special, original and powerful.
---
no it definetly does not
---
Thanks, appreciated
---
If you think that number is impressive, you're in a world of shock and awe.
---
How is this advertising?
---
this will be my first thing to try aswell
---
That's number 6
---
If you want to, sharing it so it gains traction is the best. The only hope is that Bungie goes out of their way to ban him, as the report system in the game doesn't work at all.
---
Learning to snipe here I'd like some pointers
---
That‚Äôs one of the best D1 exotics. Whoever was fortunate to use it know what I‚Äôm talking about.
