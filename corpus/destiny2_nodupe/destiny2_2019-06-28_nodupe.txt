Never played borderlands but Halo I can similarities in some places
---
---
---
There are gonna be some exotic quests that you can’t do if you don’t get the dlc in the annual pass for example the last word
---
When do they plan to kill it?
---
Damn I didn’t get my beta code yet!
---
Halo
---
There wasn't any DLCs after Forsaken. Osiris and Warmind were before it. If you mean the season pass for Forsaken then there is more content available for the Forsaken expansion.
---
thank you!!!!!
---
You are your character, we're playing as ourselves revived in the future.
---
On July 9th according to [TWAB.](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/47952)
---
Np
---
It’s what I would call a big oof. 55 more gigs to go...
---
Wow, you have a mighty e-peen
---
I think I played around 230 hours or so?  Just did some quick math on dtracker.  So is that a yes to buy now, wait or both?
---
Ok thanks
---
The fuck is with people making petitions for everything nowadays
---
Borderlands when it comes to gameplay loop with a halo feel
---
All hell will break loose
---
Was literally just about to buy this in [Battle.net](https://Battle.net), then seen it was moving to Steam, which I don't (and don't want to) use.
---

---
Oh well.  The search for a game to play continues...
---
Well they are down for today because of stuff
---
I personally think borderlands as it is the same genre (loot and shoot ) and has a lot of gameplay mechanics which are similar e.g. different heroes to pick from, different guns that u can equip which were looted from bosses and have different perks and effects (fire), there are different skill trees for your chosen character and finally it’s a free roam game 
---
I know many will say halo as the striking similarities in the campaign but look at it this way, if you gave the same story to minecraft as halo, the gameplay and everything else about the game would be completely different
---
That’s why I think that borderlands is more similar to destiny than halo
---
People are dumb. And yes the average is 10 minutes look at destiny tracker and yes it is work it. Or do you think farming 45 last wish raids is worth 1k. Managerie is one of the easiest and most efficient farms in the game. Too efficient rn.
---
Is it Thursday yet?
---
It got me thinking, “is this cross save really worth 12 hours of maintenance”?
---
Woosh
---

---
That's how I got my first 7th column
---
“Are you saying I can dodge Cabal drop pods?”
---
“No, Neo. I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready, you won't have to.”
---
Harpy Calvary!?  
---
Dude that Hob literally stared you down like “yeah bish, I’ll ride you and your buddies too” 0 fucks given just pure pride on taming his new steed to join the higher Calvary ranks.
---
What did you weather it with? Rub n buff or silver paint marker? Looks amazing
---
A bit off topic, but anyone here who plays in Europe? I hit 500 a day ago and am looking for players or friends to play with!
---
I never said it wasn't. Just using it as an example of a glitch that was added as a feature.
---
Protect the runner?

When I see vex by a rally flag

This is why I hate 6v6.

Not bad for a first attempt.

Is that Gary Busey?

I had this happen to me by someone who was using jotunn. I couldn’t even react

Read the title thinking naw I’ve probably had worse... long story short I was wrong
---
Many said no and many also said yes. It's split.

Thank you for correcting my capitalization mistake

U/Johncena21596, listen to this guy ^. He's right.

And also to clear another thing up, you just need to unlock Volundr, once you do you will be able to do Bergusia.

Random drop! I found it at the postmaster, said a quick prayer to rngesus, and got exactly what I wanted.

Do you have a solution to propose or are you just here to both and moan

Alternate Title: Can Bungie make it so I can get competitive crucible rewards without actually being a competitive player?
---
This
---
Someone at bungie is a time traveler confirmed
---
Yes actually. Matchmaking with people who are the same rank
---
Damn that's unfortunate that you still haven't gotten the Ikelos_SG yet. Well don't worry, it's worth the grind. It amazes me that even though they've nerfed it so many times, it is still my *undisputed* go-to shotgun. The only thing that would *maybe* dethrone it for me would be a Threat Level with Trench barrel.
---
I literally said nothing about rewards but okay?
---
I’m in. Spray paint is on you, though.
---
I'm really impressed with how well squared all the stickers are. It helped ease the panic of stickers on the car in the first place.

Didn’t accidentally buy it lol! On PS4, close app and delete are very close, wasn’t paying attention, went to close it out to restart it but I wasn’t paying attention and deleted it lmao. So I had to spend all the time reinstalling

More like r/sparrowed

Ah the Ole Time Traveling Patcharoo
---
Flashbacks to the infinite super glitch in the Inverted Spire.
---
I got this too!
---
Are you gonna do Lumina?
---
Wait............................what?
---
There were so many glitches back then. Must have driven Bungie mad!
---
The worst is when you damage him enough so he runs around but is still immune. Stepping on those plates sucks with the stomps.
---
RIP Cayde. His jokes and his one liners will be missed.
---
I’m a bit ootl, what cheese are y’all talking about?
---
Your movements were likely too similar to what an AFK bot can do. The only way to get better is to try, after all “why u haff to be mad? Is only gaem.”
---
Can't wait to see Cayde 6 again, man he was good in D1 lets hope they don't wreck hi in D2
---
Step 2 is profits!
---
Hmm, I recall he’s a Lightbearer, and not a guardian - meaning he was revived by a ghost, but not his ghost.
---
Can’t the Awoken can recall their past lives after they become guardians?
---
LAWLZ GET REKT SCRUB
---
They should both have it imo. Only getting one reward for either activity is pretty unrewarding for the time spent.
---
And 9/10 times they have OEM,the last titan is the burning maul wormgod's caress that's slaughtering your team with one shot hammers
---
Format?

TELL THE TO LINE UP FASTER

Love how it's called dragonfly

We still need Brazil, Chicago, and Europa. The concepts for them are so cool

A god roll would be surrounded and one of the new perks too I think.

Warlocks get a free long range shotgun blast with added damage resistance.
---
And not to mention the "killed by the architects" melee.
---
Sincerely, a salty titan
---
What about making him the new kenny (from south park) which dies every time just to come back?!
---
Like, in a serious scene ulden says something stupid and our guardian is like "oh just shut up" and shoots him in the head... But then he is revived for the next scene...
---
It is 800 silver idk where they got 700 from
---
I can hear this picture.
---
Still crossing my fingers that we might one day get to see the "Old Chicago" they originally planned for D1

In the time you wasted typing where is Xur into reddit you could have save yourself time and typed it into a search browser and found your answer but you’re a dummy so I expected nothing less.
---
I agree

hahahah that's what it said in the picture too!! :D :D :D
---
I always do the lost sector in the mars main area (where ana is). Just sparrow in, past the thralls and stuff that spawn, blast the boss and, run out, repeat. Gets you 10 seeds per run I'm pretty sure
---
Play risk if rain 2 on steam, thank me later.
---
I swear to god if I see another JoJo reference I’m gonna lose it..
---
Had a similar encounter tonight when I was doing my weekly matches. Just in QP solo queue and total sweats team just mops the floor with us. Negative kd for daysssss. Takes the fun out of it imo. I kinda suck at pvp and I really get discouraged when I’m just creamed by really good players EVERY MATCH.
---
This thread hurts me
---
Wait, noone in a 6-pack of OEM titans cant wear Stompeez....
---
At some point you may have slipped into and/or out of a vex sim
---
Raids will give you a significant boost if that’s what you’re looking for
---
Yep, that's all correct
---
The one about bray descovering caves on mars was pretty weird
---
Do your flashpoint every week, do the daily heroics at the flashpoint when offered, do your 20 bounties for a powerful from ikora, do your two frames for the black armory (this is 3 total powerful, 2 frames and whatever ada-1 gives you), three strikes matching the singe element plus anytime there’s a daily powerful, three heroic missions for the week, nightfall, 3 gambit matches, 4 gambit prime matches, 5 crucible matches, Spiders main “wanted” bounty, ascendant challenge and then blind well bounties from Petra, the 4 bounties/treasure maps for the new season. I know I’m missing some, forgive me it’s 6:45AM
---
My point is there’s literally SO MANY things that offer powerful gear now.
---
Rallying on Titan could be a mistake. It’s overrun...
---
Destiny still had 10x the twitch viewers while it was down for maintenance than anthem
---
It's funny to hear people get pissy over stupid things, and can't quantify how they got beat by a gun that requires skill instead of apeing out with the EZ guns. A fusion rifle requires a certain skill since you have to charge it.
---
There was this guy hogging all the heavy ammo for The Colony to combat 3 snipers 100 yards away in quickplay. He got it 3 times in a row with no kills. He was camping heavy again and I shoulder charged him out of the way at the last second. It felt so great.
---
Cheese is fucked up
---
Might be worth mentioning this MacBook Pro has an SSD with about 2GB/sec read speed
---
There are tons of posts but here’s my list especially with limited time:
---
1. Focus on getting level 50 with one character (warlock supers are strong for both PVE and PVP at this point so a good start!) by doing quests and the occasional bounty/pvp if you need some spice in your life
---
2. As you level, do anything that says daily/weekly rewards since they, along with bounties from vanguard and crucible vendors, will give a little exp boost.
---
3. After level 50, continue to do those things that reward “powerful gear” as these will boost your light level (which after the campaign should be close to 690 with the power boost quest with the season of opulence)
---
4. Decide what you have time for and enjoy. There’s competitive PvP with a ranking system, there’s normal PvP, raids, and general weekly bounties from different people. This is where you begin to decide what’s worth it and how much time that you have! 
---
Best of luck!
---
I have laughed way harder than I should have
---
Yeh. We had to clear out everything again... Those maitenances are exhausting...
---
What are catch up mechanics?
---
\*tumble weed rolls by\*
---
That is a wonderful list. I'll check all of those out the moment I get home. Thanks so much.
---
Thank you for this. My level is 715. Warlock main with no other characters.
---
Ran into a stack of chaperone/not forgotten users earlier with my friends. After killing them a few times with my last word they proceeded to tea bag me whenever they got me back cause apparently the last word is way more sweaty than their 3.0 death balling x)
---
I know it always seems like this, especially in gambit for me, when I play with my own fire team we lose most of the time, but when it’s randomized we win almost every one
---
oddly relatable
---
It's amazing. Destiny was meant to be played on a PC.
---
ゴゴゴゴゴゴゴゴゴゴ
---
Use the Always On Time sparrow for this kind of stuff. It’s obviously not as good as d1, but it’s the only sparrow in d2 that has 6 boosts rather than 4.
---
Oh I know, I mean make every mission if not most have the option of doing it a PvP way or a PvE wat
---
I’m not gonna woooosh you might, but I meant that those reflections looked like the Stands from JoJo
---
9 times a week total isnt really that much
---
Really depends on how much time you have to play the game or if you have annual pass.
---
They probably won’t. You can already get 2 rewards from the 1 chest when the chalice is upgraded.
---
Nah the name is already incredible
---
It doesn’t matter. Don’t abuse glitches, it can get you banned and it is annoying to play against.
---
Except you aren’t paying for the old DLC’s they’ve came with forsaken for free since two weeks after its release.
---
The King’s Fall one is etched into my soul
---
Shadowkeep starts like this.
---
There's always someone who just has to ruin the joke. /s
---
You aren’t paying for the base game and DLC’s those have always come for free with forsaken
---
Titan melee is overpowered. All Titans do is run around so saying that's a disadvantage is disingenuous. Titans supers are all stronger than Warlocks and so are Hunters. I'm a Warlock main and I'm sick of feeling at a disadvantage against the other classes.
---
Every single D1 one is etched into my soul for all eternity.
---
I don’t know. Is it possible to want both games to succeed? I love Destiny and I really wanted Anthem to succeed. They were both fun in their own way. As a gamer, we should want this.

Oh boy cataclysm

ok buddy

you beautiful ray of sunshine, thank you!!
---
What glitch?
---
The bombs on Kings fall were aggressively rage inducing if you were playing w randoms
---
Nope, literally the same. Say they will keep it for now but change it later
---
Because they have the best neutral game and account for the majority of players
---
My friend who is up to date on the meta has informed me that this is list is out of date

What, the simple fix of reducing the timer to say 30 or 40 secs? I'm no programmer so yeah that may take a very long time to do /s

In the video it's powered by a USB phone power bank. You can Velcro a smaller one to the bottom of the gun.

---
The grip needs to be solid because the gun is heavy. I tried to avoid weakening the back of the gun.
---
I do that with fighting lion, but instead of the water its the back of my teammates head, and instead of on purpose its during a game-deciding firefight.
---
I got it launch day, it was horrific on console with constant crashing, glitches, and dropping in frames consistently. As far as I know the console community is near dead, but the PC community seemed to have a alright launch

This is all well and good although I can’t help but feel the need to turn our attention to the moon as Taniks has no house, he kneels before no banner, owes allegiance to no Kell. He is a murderer, and very good at what he does. I have been tracking him since wolves broke their chains, yes? Now Taniks works for Wolfpack, but not for long...
---
Perhaps
---
Indeed
---
*cough* Hunter master race *cough*
---
I would quit if I was invader
---
I just cant understand how people that use ultra crutch call others out for using crutch.
---
A guy in my clan was also complaining about Hunters and Warlocks having crutches in PVP.
---
Checked his loadout -&gt; OEM Titan with absolute basic broken loadout
---
i dont respect you with the double nade launcher

Yes, the nightfalls were manually changed on Wednesday. I made a stickied comment, but would have to re-post the infographic in order to put up the updated one, and since I (or someone else) will be putting up the Xur infographic in about 2 hours, I figured it wasn't worth making another post for the weekly infographic.
---
Actually i find that hunters dominates most activities . If im doing menagerie , strikes or whatever there is often a majority of hunters in my squad . They just seem to be the most popular overall.
---
It was rarely just empowered left. Typically it was "who is empowered left?"

Knew. Knew.

I’m still that kid that has my mom make dinner and bring my plate to my room so I don’t have to stop playing!

Hope you have it. If not, sucks to suck.

It is amazing all the things I don’t know about a game I’ve been playing for years...
---
Happens to me waaaaaay too often
---
That's the dream. Live it up when it happens haha
---
Thanks for the reply, #2 actually has tactical mag and drop mag. I've been using tactical mag because of ophidian aspect, but I guess I'll be using drop mag whenever I'm using a different exotic.
---
On Mars
---
You've collected the infinity activities!
---
Precisely!!!
---
theres the thing you have to be shot a lot of people say its op becaus tracking but tracking doesnt matter if you've already killed them or need one shot to kill them
---
Judging by his other comments, it was not

Too bad the super does garbage damage compared to Nova Bomb and Blade Barrage

ok so nobody asked

There... isn’t exactly a book...

“Tethered!” “Tethered! “Tethered!”

“Dammit guys, only one person shoots!”

It better be the torture dance
---
No, don’t let them back in, I’m teaching them a lesson about spacing.
---
This really, really needs some "Bold" action going on, as well as some different spacing. It's kind of tough to read as of now.
---
Armor, weapons, and perks from D1 were destroyed by ghaul when he attacked the last city. The only thing that sticks with you is your characters appearance and their deeds. When you go to startup D2 you’ll have a legacy montage where it will take you through stuff you did in D1 like when you went the black garden and when you defeated atheon.
---
if you're solo queuing in comp you're kinda doing it wrong. its usually 4 stack or bust since with 3 teammates of your choice you can at least guarantee they a) won't suck and b) won't quit before end of match. LFG a 4 stack if you don't have a clan to help out and try to make sure everyone is around the same glory. if you queue with a 5500 player in your stack you're gonna have a bad time
---
Yeah but if you cryo pod yourself, you're technically still alive. Dont ghosts usually go for dead things?
---
My apologies, the Luke smith post says later in the summer rather than in the next patch.
---
For some reason when ever I trade in materials to get engrams they never end up better than the gear I already have, for this reason I see the spider as pointless now. Is this a bug or is this just me?
---
Also I’ve never heard of these chests on Nessus, to open them to I just talk to the robot guy? I have both Forsaken and the Annual Pass.
---
You dont see sleeper in crucible often
---
Plz bungie...i need cross save now
---
OR (and this is a shocker, I know) how about when the guy in my discord not turn off his mic and communicate in game?
---
The kid stayed in game was getting frustrated because he sucked at invading and I told him to stop going in because he wasn’t helping us kill the prime evil. 
---
This really seems like your the kind of kid he keeps going in and dying over and over because you want to get that revenge kill and instead fuck over the team and lose us the game. 
---
Jesus.
---
How it works is you get higher power level items by doing things that list "powerful gear" as the reward. Normal items won't be powerful. 
---
However, a lot of people like to turn in planet materials in order to get things that come from dismantling gear, such as enhancement cores. 
---
&gt;Also I’ve never heard of these chests on Nessus, to open them to I just talk to the robot guy? I have both Forsaken and the Annual Pass.
---
There's supposed to be quests to introduce you to each part of the annual pass. You must complete the introductory quest from Benedict in the tower first.
---
I ran it this week on PC and did not have much of an issues finding a matchmade team
---
So everything won’t be f2p?
---
You need them for:
---
1. both for Infusion
---
2. Glimmer for bounty purchases
---
3. Shards for planetary materials (or enhancement cores) at spider
---
4. Raid banners at Petra (both)
---
5. Nessus Barge Chests once per week (~80k glimmer) 
---
6. Applying mods to armor/weapons (glimmer)
---
7. Applying shaders to ships (glimmer)
---
Are you convinced they aren't useless yet? Or do I need to keep going?
---
Both of these Issues (not that the second is an Issue or even what its about) are being addressed in the same Patch.
---
Therefore your Meme is bad and you should be ashamed.
---
actually fuck you’re right. okay then there’s an internal clock that tells the pod to kill you when the time is right. positioned next to where the last city is we’d be found by ghosts. that’s the hope. the wish. the dream.
---
Did you bother reading the entire thing? Because if you did, you would have read the 2017 date listed also.........
---
Maybe I'll try this, thank you
---
Wait. So sharing a video montage of game clips you made with the intent of fun in considered self promotion? 
---
Or did I miss a qualifying piece?
---
Yeah, the screen you saw was titled "Next Week in Destiny".
---
Might want to read things a bit closer in the future.
---
I so remember my second vault run, got nothing, was furious I spent nearly 6 hours with my poor fireteam. Wouldn't call it a blast by any means.
---
all i want is someone to run through all the campaign to get my level up. i pretty much only play PVP and have completely lost interest in the destiny grind and campaign.
---
Please don’t... Titan is probably my least favorite location if it’s anything like it is in D2
---
If this is regular gambit and you never got a stack of primeval slayer it makes sense for your teammates to not shoot the primeval.
---
User name checks out. Nothing but noise.
---
good points. i was thinking i could change some of the info but ur making me think it would be more hassle than anything.
---
What exactly is the significance of testing new exotics on Calus and not another boss? I don’t get it
---
He sits inside my PC to this day
---
Please stop leaking Shadowkeep cutscenes.

Indeed.

You can purchase the runefinder consumable from Benedict/Werner that will give a chance at extra runes for 4 hrs. Then you can do strikes, gambit, crucible or menagerie to get them. Unlocking the Rune Bonus slots on your chalice will also give you additional runes and let you keep 1 sloted rune when you open the chest in menagerie.
---
About the blink thing, titans blink with you. If shoulder charge (or the super's melee) is in range to hit you it doesn't matter if you blink away because they can hit melee post-blink and it will follow you straight into the sky and kill you
---
Incredible detail.

Lol. Can't stop, won't stop

Double post m8 why don’t you go chill

Yet you’re insulting other people and being condescending

Previously posted me being under the map so I decided to also show how to do it.
---
Titans: Hell Yeah!!!

How am I insulting people
---
You do not have to be in Enemy of my Enemy to access the room.  Just go to Titan, go to the area, open the door and pick it up.  Titan doesn't even have to be the flashpoint.

[How to start the Outbreak Perfected quest.](https://old.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/bmruj0/fallen_transponderzero_hour_frequently_asked/)

This is kind of a strange post, usually people think that you have to *spare* the fallen to get the transponder, not kill him. In reality it does not matter, you can start the quest either way.
---
More runes instead.
---
This is awesome. Good job on it sir.
---
Screw that noise! I got a good chuckle out of it!
---
There are some very good weapons in there.

Wrong sub?

Sick mask ornament too
---
Cheers dude, it wasn't that loud was it? People are saying their ears are bleeding.
---
Same!!
---
It was a bear and a walrus overlayed, odd eh?
---
Explain to me how Sloane can sit with her arms and face exposed on Titan with liquid methane right behind her. I’ll wait.
---
Nah I just not loud just gives me the heebie jeebies. I could see how it was too loud if people are listening through headphones or something.
---
Yes, it may give you a 'start'.
---
Really? Read the post. Titan....it's a moon/planet......it was terraformed by the travel. 
---
New to Destiny? Welcome.
---
It’s a known bug when you share instances. It won’t be there when you reinstance. Someone scanned and it bugged while you were there is all.
---
Vog should be “I NEED CLEANSE! I NEED CLEANSE! I NEED CLEEEEEAAAAA- *guardian down*”
---
Can I use this as a top ten plays video I am making?  The winner gets $20 in silver.
---
🤜🏻✋🏻
---
But liquid methane....even if there was oxygen (highly likely because of the Traveler) it’d be like -100 degrees.
---
Your crush accidentally touched your leg
---
Can't tell if you're joking in that last part or not lol but you can use it if you want.
---
With the traveler being awake now, isn't there a way for it to bring Cayde &amp; his ghost back? I was dead, the traveler created a ghost to find me, ghost brings me back, if we both die the traveler should be able to just create another ghost to find me again..
---
I may be missing out on some important lore that prevents this but my logic makes sense to me.
---
I didn't make the rules, I enforce them, if you've got a complaint make it out to aether, or sheep, they'd love to hear from you
---
Thank you Lord Count_Chronic
---
Trials in D1 was to me the best thing bungie has done in both D1 and D2 it keep me playing D1 for way longer than i would have. And keep me semi interested in D2 although it was way to easy in D2 and pvp was a mess hence my hiatus to BR's and the need to level my character up. I remember seeing the charts of the spike of active players during the weekends when trials would come out and it was huge, i have no idea why they would not make this priority 1 as far as PVP goes.
---
The other mods haven't seen this yet
---
I got It yesterday. Perfect example on how to make an exotic quest boring and repetitive
---
They brought the quest back for the reverly but aside waiting to see if the next event brings it back its a random exotic drop like the majority of them
---
No. The quest was a limited time thing. 
---
You can, however, get the Thunderlord in a random drop.
---
It means linking any social media account that you  own, not cancerous clickbait, wanna post this sort of stuff, ask the mods
---
Got ya. I get it. 
---
Since I just started how long until I see items or missions from these dlcs?
---
Does it come with outlaw?
---
Yeah sure, feel free to use it :)
---
This is a video
---
I got there solo...... also 4:07
---
Also, would you send me the link then?
---
My bad, it does increase damage. Currently, it's only a 5% bonus though. Not even a headshot with monarque will one tap with a 5% buff.
---
You did not get to legend solo with a 1.2 k/d looool
---
Increasing shotgun range is like making a machine gun with sniper range
---
What if instead of calling for a nerf, you attempt to find ways to out play fusion rifle players? Try things like abusing corners, sniping from out of their range, or ganking them with a shotty at close range.
---
It’s really simple and all of the modeling software is free.

I mean your allowed to voice your Oppinions but that doesn't mean other people can't call you out when you do it mean spiritedly. The man had a good match, let him have it. All you gotta do is scroll pass. It costs nothing
---
I'm the same way
---
You did not get to legend at all according to your page, especially not with a 1.2 k/d. And at 4:07 is a random quote made up for laughs, it does not say I said it. You’re pretty deft lol.

Iron banner armor with ornaments or the old factions armor with ornaments
---
Fusion range is pretty wild but the solution definitely isn’t increasing shotty range. Fusion rifles are currently low risk but very high reward, something like harsher damage falloff after a certain range would be nice. I shouldn’t be getting one shotted challenging at medium to long range with a primary.
---
Just leave your clan settings on open. Mine jumped to 100 in no time.
---
Thank you for not being the person that quits
---
Might even be 1st reset lol. Go and check drifter inventory see if you can buy it.
---
Diggity, thanks bunches
---
And yet it was removed as against the rules for loot/achievement posts. The rules don't want it here either. If OP read the rules, it wouldn't have been posted in the first place.
---
What the F are you smoking? Clippy looks like a paper clip. Does this look like a paper clip to you?
---
Wake the f*ck up Guardian, you’ve been dead a really, really long time, so you’re going to see a lot of things you don’t understand.
---
It's the same eyes and eyebrows. That's what i mean
---
Yeah I have game pass. I was looking for a game to play through with a friend and I remember sinking alot of hours into destiny. I just had hope that there would be at least something for players who have been there for so long. If the DLC is relatively same as the first 2 or the base game then I wont be missing out on much. If its exceptionally better then the base game and the first few DLC its kinda sad that you need to buy a dlc to have a better experience on a game youve already spent so much money on imo. But to each their own I guess. Ill just try replaying the base game and see if I can get the same enjoyment out of it as I did when it first came out.
---
Read the rules, please. Loot/Achievement posts not allowed.
---
It's not like you did great lol. You lost over half what you deposited, killed 1 guardian, and 100% damage means that you were the only one to shoot it. Whether that means you used full heavy and super or shot it once.
---
If that dead Titan is still there when we go back I’m gonna be the big sad
---
yeah those are taken off clippy and just randomly put on this picture? IS OP trying to say that this blue pile of goo looks like a paper clip to him? You said you were wondering too so thats why I wasn't sure.
---
LoW takes 0 skill and is the best gun in the game. You're the only one who disagrees. Miss me with all this bullshit and rethink what you just said.
---
Definitely not give more range on shotguns. No. Gunnora's Axe doesnt need to map...
---
I'm going to reach level 50 before the main destiny campaign even starts by playing crucible I
---
I’m not even sure that /s is necessary. By the time the menu loads you’ve already been locked it
---
I can make another and sell it to you lol
---
You're breathTaken.
---
Thought I was the only one who is terrified of them above all other characters in the game
---
don't tell me please, for my sake and for yours, that you're doing 0-50 in the EDZ only.
---
I did it legit and used the iron banner grenade launcher and play of the game. I didn’t really have trouble with the double kills so I focused on calculated trajectories with play of the game. Most of the double kills and medals would be with heavy so make sure you always try to grab it. I got 7 calculated trajectories in one game once with heavy. Try to get 1 or 2 kills with it and finish with the other grenade launcher if you have to. Also I used spike grenades on my special grenade launcher and went invisible with my hunter to try to get up close.
---
What did the quest give at the time?
---
I just revisited this post, and I just love how no one really cares about these changes anymore with all the latest news that has been surfacing.
---
It gave a powerful item from the package you got from the associated vendor (ikora/drifter) and then drop an enhancement core if you sided with the vanguard or some synths if you sided with the drifter.
---
What are you trying to say?
---
You can also get 100% damage for being the only one shooting the primeval when it spawns... Because the rest of the team are *shooting the envoys* and the other team melts their primeval. Seriously, the amount of people that ignore envoys, even after they added dialogue about it.
---
Shoulda put “Great minds think alike”
---
You don't like game mode. Don't play game mode. 
---
Game is not for loot. Game for fun
---
It will make pvp much, much harder because more people will have it.
---
Yeah, I get you. 😅
---
Or at least add Dark mode
---
This one’s my favorite
---
No in crucible and in the EDZ
---
Shadowkeep _ends_ like this. Where you get knocked out because the Darkness suppresses your Light and Ghost goes into hibernation. Then Zavy finds you and this...
---
Did you watch the ViDoc?
---
Ah! There's the gatekeeping I was looking for. 
---
Yea no, I took a two month break, came back for the new content and found it boring. Cept they raised the power cap _again_ which means I gotta grind it out in preperation for Shadowkeep in the hopes _that_ brings something actually new and different than 'Raidlite.'
---
What if I don’t want to?
