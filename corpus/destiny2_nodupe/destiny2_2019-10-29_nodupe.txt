I'm currently sitting at about 840-ish glory points. So I'm about 15-25 wins away from hitting fabled. All I have to do is reach fabled.
---
The thing is it‚Äôs not like you went purely for guardian kills either. Gg man, bet they were tilted to hell
---
I bet you are one of those guys that just camps at the portal all game /s
---

---
In all seriousness tho... holy shit
---
See here's the thing about Destiny in its entirety you have to play and listen to the characters in every DLC examples of this is Shaxx talking about Ikora in the crucible or looking at the things you are given like quests if you actually paid any attention at all you'd know a lot more about all of it and not just mindlessly hate the game
---
Sometimes it really feels like people don't even bother bringing any type of weapons to Gambit. Especially when I'm getting 90%+ damage to primeval.
---
I am D2 on Xbox one as well. What's your gamertag, so when I get home from work I can add you we can play a few games together and if we work well together we can do it together
---
Fighting lion is getting me a ton of them
---
Bad ass
---
I will be online tonight in a few hours or tomorrow. I'm mostly available during the weekend and school holidays. My gamertag is mimicshark39859
---
The in-between is putting in minimal effort to get powerful rewards.
---
You can visit the Spider and buy some with planatery materials or shards
---
Oh that makes more sense.also i forgot the gambit boss has less health since i only play gambit prime
---
Ohhh i thought it meant that the expansion is usually only 10 bucks. I‚Äôm dumb
---
4 sowrds (spectral blade) Genji mains when
---
What kind matchmaking we havre now then?
---
Amen brother
---
I'm glad Titan is not wearing OEM.
---
I wish I could, have a friend who at the time only had the sniper after ~70 runs and was pissed at me lol.
---
What's your gamertag? So I can recognize you. I dont have a mic but we could do a discord voicecall. I probably won't be online tonight because of schoolwork.
---
Sure.
---
I've never seen a hacker and I've played 130 hours on pc since shadowkeep with probably the majority being pvp. Why would I give up all the benefits of playing on pc just so I don't run into a hacker one if every hundred+ matches? They're probably going to show up on console at some point too, they did in d1.
---
Well im guilty of being sweaty and tryharding in qp, but i dont use toxic loadouts. I use hyper aggressive loadouts like imperial decree and NF and just charge in head first with my trusty dunemarchers cos thats how i like to play.
---
r/fireteams
---
I do too.. but only because I can't aim to save my life. I am technically contributing if 1 bullet out of an entire mag hit the enemy.
---
He looks so sad
---
Ape of culture I see
---
I'll be home in about 2 hours and I should be able to add you
---
Fighting Lion. I sucked with it at first but after a week or 2 I was getting 3-4 calculated trajectory medals a game. I'm pretty sure I got the double kills using The Colony. It's basically a guaranteed 2 kills if you catch players together.
---
Skullfort + Ballistic Slam
---
'nough said
---
I just put down bubbles and try to be friendly like emoting, sometimes it works.

Hand cannon sniper pairing.
---
"I want to stab you to death and play with your blood"
---
Oh hey its like dft but tf2
---
I managed to win a round with 1 vs 3. I was amazed when I pulled it off. Then they realised I was by myself and all rushed, wasn‚Äôt fun üòÇ
---
No casuals in Destiny. Only Blueberries, and we love them.
---
I have full auto on a few weapons. My favorite one is my first Vouchsafe with explosive rounds and full auto. It was decent for a while until it wasn‚Äôt. I might take it out again since Scouts have supposedly been buffed.
---
I think they may have gotten their d1 treatment
---
Well, there are plenty of FPS games that I really do enjoy, such as Planetside 2. They don't have to have a super wide selection of melee stuff. They just need to have 1 or 2 that aren't completely horrible, and I'm set for the game
---
Making my way to that but need Lunas
---
Not a better version per se, but you can always grab it out of collections from your start menu. That way you never have to worry about losing it permanently.
---
I'm new to pc, so I hit "I", go left to the collections tab, then click on weapons. It will be under the tab "auto rifles" on the farthest right page.
---
Honestly I really prefer ghosts astonishment with the pyramid. Truly shows how vast and surprising it‚Äôs presence is.

Congrats!! What was your strat?
---
I‚Äôd do it myself if I could afford a rig lol. Hanging with Xbox for now though

What kind of a player are you in most games? (Fast pace play, heavy assault, etc)
---
*video killed the radio star~*
---
Cayde bunny suit body pillow when?
---
Yes. And I'm season level 31. I've got both boosters.
---
[deleted]
---
Thank you.
---
Hunter is good for people who like hit and run tactics. Warlock is best for people who like to support and deal high DPS. Titan is good for tanking and dealing massive melee damage.
---
Really since everything is unlocked by default now, you can just make one of each class and experiment out in the open world until you decide what you like.
---
I personally have 54,000+ kills in Gunslinger alone
---
I'm more amazed you had teammates actually guarding zones. I about shit myself over that. Just finished a bajillion rounds of control to get Eriana's Vow catalyst, and I don't think I ever got one team that didn't just hand over zones over and over until we lost. Got old gettin a good number of kills and caps just to lose about every match anyway lol
---
Hmm, I wonder what he‚Äôs grinding for?
---
At just 900 weapons, my second character hit 905 before the sk campaign ended, if you're 930+ you should be 915+ in a day easily, probably caught up in a week or two if you play very little like me right now
---
Titan is best for ad clearing warlock is best for damage buffs and a little of everything and then hunter is straight up solo player
---
I think it's still on a rotating basis. Each week a planet will have a "flashpoint" objective to do stuff on the planet. I think that's when the heroic story missions pop up.
---
Well hell yeah! I‚Äôve got a rare one I‚Äôve been holding on to just in case, thanks for the return updated info!  Have fun in Festival of the Lost and getting your new sniper :)
---
No problem.
---
glass cannon
---
GGs bud! Just got mine about 2 weeks ago after 12 hours of Comp. God, it was fun and stressful. Hope you had a good time! Enjoy your new toy!
---
I play hunter and I spent almost the entire boss phase just running around using my invisibility Dodge when necessary and reviving the others. It took a while but we won on the second try.
---
‚ÄúOur..? ‚Äú
---
‚ÄúGIBBEEEHHH!!!‚Äù
---
There is a way to make that viable
---
I¬¥m horrible in Crucible but in gambit i¬¥m doing quite well on my own but the teammates in gambit are... oooogohohohoh.... I just had a guy literaly 1m to my left stare into a wall while i was fighting an invader with 15 motes
---
Grinded this out as well and I never wanna play Gambit again lol
---
Lol warlock = etc.
---
IF you play on PC, Download Discord and add this channel to your discord.  [https://discord.gg/MG2dMd](https://discord.gg/MG2dMd)

Basically has a built in LFG for anything like Exotic quests.  Hope this helps you
---
what aBOUT the Helm of Saint-14!??
---
Always be the first to bank, that's a guaranteed medal. And try to have 5 on you when you're almost at primeval stage so you can bank as soon as you hear the drifter instruct you to, that's another guaranteed medal.
---
Ok
---
Vault-22 the exo male hunter
---
A legend in crucible, they say he roams trials maps to this day picking apart teams with a well placed shadow of veils shot, with his trusty eyasluna at his hip, ready to pull it out in an instant and make quick work of a guardian. This guardian is so in tune with his blink they say he knows his exact end posigion he before he pulls his arm back.
---
The great thing about New Light Destiny is that you can play and switch between all of them at will from the very beginning.  The best thing to do is create one character for each class, then switch between subclasses for each to see how they feel in the opening quest.  Personally, I like Void Warlock for magichands! lol, short-range teleportation, and healing (latter of which all Warlocks have), but Arc Hunter for hyper mobility and the acrobaticness of the super.  But that‚Äôs just me!  They‚Äôre all fun in their own way, though I know that doesn‚Äôt make your decision of which to start with any easier!
---
And one day you‚Äôll realize sleeper is the easiest ‚Äúgrind‚Äù you have ever done.
---
Hey thats my  build, well whataya know~
---
You can get in on imperial decree??? Shit now I've gotta farm for it again
---
F
---
Dragonfly makes the target explode when you kill them with a precision shot. Slap a dragonfly spec on that bad boy to make the explosion bigger. Good for killing hoards of red bars.
---
*sees post*
---
Nice
---
*opens laptop and spams Bungie with the image with subject*
---
MAKE THIS HAPPEN!!
---
I'm sure as hell Bungie would make it epic you seen their live trailers??
---
The post I replied to, you just said "It is a fun gun" so it just threw me off.
---
Punch punch punch?
---
Big salute
---
I'll try ~~spinning~~ punching that's a good trick!
---
I always thought Warlock tbh
---
PUNCH
---
No. i dont think you can raise damage to other guardians using mods
---
I wouldn't.. it's really not nice
---
To end the misery? Sounds like a good idea!
---
Yeap can almost always see one stack of cheaters at 3.9k to the point i almost uninstall. They range from netlimitters to aimbot speedhacks and are almost always chinese. Its super frustrating to see your first 2-3 shots not counting only for them to kill you or melee you twice in the same timespan as your one melee. I hated OEM before this but now OEM looks like an utter joke in comparison to these cheats
---
I also had the riskrunner drop on me randomly, I feel mildly robbed
---
Everyone keeps telling me jade is better, but I... I love polaris. I used mida and jade though to try to gain some perspective, fell in love with mida, and threw jade to the curb lol
---
*laughs in shoulder charge*
---
That's bull. They have the power to kill gods yet their not "pOwEr fUlL" enemies
---
Where's my fuckin hawkmoon, I feel the urge to stab someone with a pistol grip
---
Oh, so you mean
---
... 
---
Punch? Glass of... punch?
---
People's brains seem to shut off when they see the sword and they forget that they're in uppercut range before they've even breached the invulnerability bubble.
---
My dream loadout.
---
I didn't know they could drop with any stat that high, you get melee'd and they die
---
No, they did that on purpose so the player could decide if they pulled the trigger or spared him to let Petra do the deed.
---
This looks awesome.
---
Based of off the gunshot heard it was Petra who killed uldren.
---
 And pulse rifle crying at a corner.
---
I respect the Jade Rabbit
---
Rip
---
Crucible would be broken if this was a thing
---
How else will I practice for my Hunter alt class? 
---
Also, I can‚Äôt tell if you all are serious or not on this sub. I just got here. Do we‚Ä¶do we hate hunters?
---
I have a simple solution let me trade one hundred vex mind component for 1 vex chassis component.... CAUSE I BLOODY WILL LOVE TO TAKE THAT DEAL
---
Oh damn...I didn't even notice that bullshittery.
---
I hate you. Nothing personal.
---
Bow Knows ..........
---
but what if you like grenades
---
I dont hate classes lol I'm making a joke as I used to use all 3 classes myself so
---
My desktop Computer had this issue I essentially I  cleared all of the temp files and uneccesary files via the cleanong system in the computer and my arma 3 went feom 100% GPU to 35% and same with my buddy when issue came up for him, I hadn't done it for over a year and half and the file overload was lagging down the computer
---
The gunshot is more similar to the Ace than vestians sound
---
That taken thicc
---
I gave up on it. I feel like I wasted many hours trying to get this gun.
---
I think it was us, if you look closely, we are the one holding the Ace of Spades in his fucking face this time.
---
...sorry i got a lil emotionnal there...
---
Dang, so just a CCleaner run might help?
---
Dang, that's insane. GG
---
I was also there. All everyone was talking about all day was how there was gonna be a riot whether they won or lost
---
Hm, last I heard it was vestian but yeah I could very well be mistaken :/
---
Just him spamming thundercoil 1shot meeles, followed by having extra weapon damage (Frontal assault) for a few kills with his scout. Presumably, he's saying that he was at 69% (YEET) and blew past it because of how many medals he got in his ape-ish rampage
---
Cheers!
---
IDK know
---
Hi. I drew this. I'm glad you like it.
---
Titan looking kinda thicc.
---
Nah I was on control lol
---
Character is unironically named "Legolas"
---
If you like mid/close range you are going to want to stick with hand cannons and submachine guns. That‚Äôs just my tipü§ó
---
I definitely plan on purchasing the jacket if I get the opportunity.
---
I had a rocket launcher drop with Boss Mod. Dismantled it because I wanted it in a grenade launcher but RIP didn't get it :(
---
All hunters are narcissists, all titans are idiots, and all warlocks are antisocial/out of their minds.
---
Can confirm, yet to beat it with randos.
---
&gt;decrease TTK
---
FTFY
---
Man, this makes titan look frickin broken.
---
cool it's yours
---
Sucks man. I did the same thing. Its all about grinding gear at this point. You really can do anything you were doing before you quit. Go to the planets you haven‚Äôt been to and do the quests there. Other than that do the flash points and some strikes/pvp to gear up. 
---
I got bored with it after a couple weeks back and moved on. The pvp is too lopsided and the raids are too difficult to get into imo.
---
I found it weird that they only did it once
---
You kinda ran at him with no plan what did you think was gonna happen?
---
Crimson and handheld Nova=easy pvp wins
---
Maybe if you're a Fallen. In case you didn't know those futuristic controls were designed for people with 3 (or more) arms. These controls are years ahead of their time. To fully optimize this controller right now, in this 2 arm world we live in, you have to coordinate with a friend who is willing to use the 3rd wing for you. It really does get quite awkward after a few hours playing like that.
---
played with randoms saddly but my vow gun did the job üòÅ
---
I‚Äôve had this happen to me three times so far.
---
This is incredible

I tried to get connordavey33's help but he was unwilling to be my third hand. I guess I just need a better friend...
---
You can trigger the start to all campaigns by seeing Amanda Holliday. (the shipwright on the eastern side of the tower)
---
It's a good way to catch you up on everything
---
Who gives a shit?
---
As a fellow vet whose seen all this shit none of this means pvp is balanced, it's just a new form of garbage.
---
The only thing that will drop higher than 950 is listed as Pinnacle Reward
---
Only pinnacle rewards drop weapons/armor at 951-960. The pinnacle gear will drop at 951 to start with. However, to get 952 rewards, all of your slots must have 951 gear/weapons. Same goes for 953-960.
---
I expected to die. It was the t-bagging and emoting the whole game after every kill that I thought was a bit unnecessary
---
Some reason I came off just playing Overwatch when I saw this post and thought that gun looks like Winstons tesla cannon, lol.
---
You've tried the best, now try the rest! SPACER'S CHOICE!
---
*Psyche! Gotcha, bitch!*
---
Or you know... Just kill a super with another super. 
---
YEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSS! 
---
It always hilarious xD

" DID HE KILL THEM ALL ? HE KILL THEM ALL ! "

" INCREDIBLE ! "

I run around with a mastereorked Waking Vigil. Talk about generating orbs out the ass. Wish I could get my hands in a dragonfly Nation of Beasts though.
---
Very cool
---
I see , im on the fence about it , heres my thing im at 917 i just need to get to 920 to do hero nightfalls , i was thinking if i get the pass with a few of those exotics it would boost my power lvl to 920 but idk man , im kinda burnt out from doing bounties , which brings up that i just need banchee 44s bounties to do , but i dont want to you get me ?
---
how is Lord Shaxx cheering u up and encourage you to do better every time you lose not HEARTWARMING?
---
*Do not molester*
---
Man I hardly knew her
---
I‚Äôm a veteran and I was rocking spiteful fang, the vow, and levi breath just the other day.  I‚Äôm also one of those weirdos that uses a bow in crucible, but there are games where I get like 23 kills with my bow.
---
Indeed
---
Use it anyway. Makes it even better
---
Nope, gotta use the LFG app and there's definitely no map chat. The game is very anti-social which kinda sucks.
---
Let me guess PC?
---
I got a decent number of rage quits and disconnects when I was grinding recluse
---
I have over 100 of these shaders.
---
 
---
You get 3 per wave seven clear.
---
5 ep weapon drops.
---
You punched him in the dick.... So many times...
---
Took you awhile, champion.
---
Yeah thats true since OEM users are clowns
---
It's a power move
---
=))
---
I have gotten that damn thing to drop 5 times in the nightfall...WTF?
---
Ah, the ole dick twist üòÇ
---
I believe this is that glitch where if any enemy you are trying to finish dies during a certain time then all the damage from the finisher goes to you
---
Which, if you didn‚Äôt know, is 999999 damage
---
It's not just good for Fallen; nearly every race has some kind of arc damage:
---
Hive Knights and witches
---
Cabal guys
---
Vex suicide units leave pools of arc damage you can run through.
---
That's Zavala's subclass.  standing like a true titan shielding his people from the darkness.  you don't disrespect Zavala
---
As a hunter who loves to punch things to death I am so proud. I salute you!
---
I‚Äôll appreciate the reference, but you pulled it in with no/bad context in a location where it has no place
---
4/10
---
New Light here, what bow? What is the special version and which strike do I have to do? Sorry for all the questions.
---
It's even funnier if you read them all together - but only read what's in the red boxes.  Mixing the order to form sentences could be a fun game.
---
And did a flawless solo heroic menagerie as well as a solo master nightfall without any champion mods
---
Ah, I see you're a man of culture as well
---
Forsaken had the most content by far, Shadowkeep is amazing and I‚Äôm loving this season, but Forsaken had more to offer
---
Yes
---
I miss this helmet.

Or a derp crane

FALLEN ALLIANCE, YEEEES?

U got three shaders yesterday and was like "WTF"?

Thank you!

Well, now I know xD

i never was a fan of headseeker, but this just put the nail in the coffin.
---
Flawless victory.
---
From the mouth of babes
---
Armor only drops once per week and is In the chest. The gun drops from the boss which you can farm over and over. With its current drop rate you‚Äôll have it within 15 kills.
---
This is me when I finally try to get Hush. Go big or go home.
---
Bad guardian!
---
please clap
---
All depends on the map. If ur in a really close range map it‚Äôs shity for obvious reasons
---
What? Your team shot it while you padded uselessly at it?
---
Take a look at the quest, if it's checked off you're good to go.
---
1. If I remember right Railguns use electromagnets to propel a bullet at high velocity, but most Linera Fusion Rifles are Laser/Energy based. Only Arbalest would fit that description I believe.
---
$15 for a lot more story content and access to certain exotic quests versus $35 for current endgame activities and the season pass. Make your own decision from there
---
Ohhhh. Fuck. I was just getting my weekly chest, I didn‚Äôt know I should have farmed the bosses
---
&gt; referred to as Railguns
---
I guess its time for [The Most Epic Rail Gun Montage of All Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ibtcRKN8x4)
---
Thanks, you are probably right. That will be my best bet.
---
So like...widows court or the altar of flame I'm just tired of meta and getting God roll guns is super confusing
---
Just leveling my artifact currently to get oppressive darkness and overload grenades. Also trying working on getting Recluse, but I just suck at PvP üòÇ (but yesterday was great time) maybe finally I was getting normal teammates. Im more of a PvE person usually, but PvP in this game has something to it.
---
Maybe there is some other Void energy weapon to consider while I grind for Recluse?
---
The new seasonal titles are perfect for you then since you can only earn them during the respective season
---
I could point out why that happened m...but it seems you‚Äôve been roasted enough lol
---
Exactly what I thought
---
I will be totally honest I can't tell what kind of guardian that is
---
Yeah you just need to kill the boss, and wait til a message pops up on the left that says ‚Äúdarkness holds steady‚Äù and you can then activate the beacon again and it starts directly at wave 6 again. Rinse and repeat Til you have the gun you want.
---
The camera follows the player that killed you. It followed him and since he moved so fast, so did the camera
---
Leviathans Breath

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXtsfKITNwQ
---
I mean. 
---
Once you add thunder coil into the mix
---
Basically.
---
Your gear was most likely just bumped up to 750. I don't think they would delete everything. Just raised the base power level.
---
Now after a few minutes of playing that gear will be old news and you'll have a brand new set of blues
---
You put a mod on though.
---
1. No
---
2. Havent been talked
---
Ok?
---
I'm just saying, these titles have been that way since they were introduced, titles are for completionists, so requiring to have everything the activity has to offer makes sense. By the time you have done all the triumphs you should have everything, especially by the time you get the ghost.
---
No it doesn‚Äôt need any nerf. Ty &amp; bb
---
hate it when that happens after I whiff super hard and my glide runs out
---
Old players do it too lol.
---
I'm glad it's like this TBH I played gambit 3 whole months nonstop when forsaken came out just to obtain the title I didn't even have time to play the main campaign as far as I'm concerned you don't deserve the title if you are not bleeding gambit or have it running through your veins
---
It has gone over a year, and it has worked, bungie isn't dumb, titles are for the people who truly dedicate time to the activity and go for 100%.
---
no i go all the triumps since long dude, and i don't have these drops, so it is definitely dumb.
---
Nice going. I don't think I even got that much guardians in my best round of 6v6 Crucible :o. This was back when Gambit was still 3 proper rounds I'm assuming (considering the amount of motes deposited is enough for 3 primevals) ?  
---
I'm always happy when my team has a guy that likes to invade and is good at it, means I can just walk around killing enemies and collecting motes and the Primeval phase. The matches where no one on my team invades and I end up going really get to me, most of the times my loadout isn't geared towards PvP and he
---
I know. This happened to me too many times while farming my Izanagi catalyst in the whisper quest. Those damn shadow thralls kept despawning when i finished them for some special ammo
---
LH + 1 2 punch before the nerf used to deal 1.3M with only 1 shot 2 hits.
---
Pretty sure there is a korok here
---
Nah, insurrection prime can be killed with any gun, I killed him with 1k and anarchy, he is just not that challenging like before
---
Most of the way, the last 200 to legend I needed some help but the rest was solo
---
I mean, fair, I suppose? In every one of my cases, I get more mileage and overall improved k/d when using other exotics. 
---
I wish it were easier to get subtle calamity rolls, my main one has max draw time and snapshot/archer's tempo, but it feels like there could be a better first perk. Also still working on getting a perfect Spiteful Fang, and is it just me, or does Hush make you play worse with a bow, trying to aggressively follow through with the draw time buff?
---
And I seriously hope bungie doesn't nerf bows due to all of the hot swap builds that pvp youtubers are highlighting, they already broke an exotic related to them and it took a couple seasons to even get arsenic bite to randomly roll :/
---
I had all those items drop from gambit, I did my dredgen title in season 5 before gambit prime.
---
Normal gambit for the Items for dredgen.
---
Okay, thanks!
---
Does my gun needs to be at 951 as well ?
---
Today, there will be an update that fixes a couple bugs with the forges. Better wait on that. 
---
The forges can be found on the EDZ map - on the very left.
---
I honestly don't get what's up with people quitting. I had quite a couple of matches of control yesterday where my team was behind by a significant margin AND CAME BACK. If you don't fight uphill battles you'll never be a true Guardian.   
---
Good for you for staying and winning like a warrior, even though the rest of your team had abandoned you.
---
Thanks! I saw that but didnt realize that you could literally test ur pc for it lol
---
Got the recluse a few days ago. But it doesn't seem OP to me... It actually feels kinda weak :\\
---
Congrats! I'm still only within the 40 range...but i'm getting there.
---
Oh look someone found another melee build.... take a number
---
It‚Äôs glitched right now. You will have to wait till Tuesday(tomorrow )
---
Nah its nothing special in pvp
---
It looks like a hive Knight with knives for a chin and forehead, and a long neck
---
Literally the ghost is 3 resets and the ship and sparrow are rng drops from the taken servitor only available in gambit. As everyone said by the time you get the time gated/ reset gated item, you'll have it. There is nothing better than being 1 drop away and that rush of joy when it drops. You just want the 2nd easiest title to be even easier than "do lost sectors get title"
---
It can make or break a titan like I primary my Titan for pvp and don't have it and still do really well but if I had it I would be off the charts
---
Good ole five punch crotch exploding technique I see. Pai Mei taught you well. Good job.
---
Currently getting the whisper catalyst after taking 4 attempts to get the base gun, and two attempts to get my first week of chests. God I hate that mission now...
---
did he come?
---
Awwww poor baby
---
Fallen doesn't count, they're too easy ;P and yeah I just forgot them so oops. And yeah Riskrunner is amazing, you can solo some stuff with it you were never meant to solo.
---
Apart from when you‚Äôre being invaded in gambit. Don‚Äôt do that.
---
Okay, awesome. Thank you for the suggestion!
---
Vex non-offensive over here
---
I can already see this in the SoTP sparrow encounter.  üòÇ
---
Your welcome!
---
It still is I think.
---
Sword.

You‚Äôre the hero we needed, not the one we deserve

Petition to add the joker bathroom dance as an emote
---
What?
---
Probably precision in pvp, slower settings helps with that, aside from that I dunno

There is no bond stronger than one of ~~blood~~ *Bubble Titans!*

Speaking of that, Forsaken is on sale rn.

Weird thing to try, but I have an odd sense of respect for you. *And now I want to do it* and I'm still too poor to afford the Chair Emote.....
---
It seems like you've run into Kruzer but I'm not sure?
---
Whisper's always been good, even without its and regeneration. I'd say DARCI is just lacking in the damage department a little bit. Whisper's auto reload is great in the current meta.
---
Yeah, no real titan will crutch on oem, only the bots do. There are so many other fun titan exotics
---
*Danger Shrimp!* he'll cut your head off with his magical sword arrrrrms!
---
After one wipe, that's a dick move.
---
After 50 wipe, everyone would leave.
---
Yeah if i have to carry my team dropping constant 40 kill games in Iron Banner and 90% of my comp matches i have to win 1v3 because my team wasted all our lives that must be the case especially coming from someone who cant even spell "yeah"
---
You ran into a Kruzer fan for sure.

I laughed a lot at this hahahahah

U do it on purpose ...

I'm a kinderguardian and just started D2 with New Light.

Boy, let me tell you how much I hate OEM wankers with a burning passion. I hope each and everyone of you perpetually has wet socks.
---
Every one of those is great! Apart from the second one. I really hate that boss.
---

Yea you stink lulz

How do you do selfies?

I've been dueling people non stop in rumble. It's especially fun with a towering barricade/bubble (challenge people to melee-offs essentially)
---
Yeah
---
"Tower's haunted"
---
Youre doing it wrong...wheres your shotgun even once?? Should have tractor cannon and emperors courtesy or last man standing, then come back with 'this just happened' when you melt the boss in 3 hits. *That* may surprise a few newbies.
---
Alright, alright, alright, let's see what we've got.
---
BOWS on the field
---
That's the sniper that can switch elements right? I honestly haven't used it much. Many other things that are good. I've heard some people swear by it though. You can certainly give it a shot, just make sure you have a fireteam with you. 
---
You may have trouble finding ammo for the sniper unless you have a way around that.
---
Well i think its one if the dances from either festival of the lost or forsaken looks like the one he does when he walks on stage before he speaks to murray i think its called something like the accidental dance
---
I never even conciderd this could be a problem for new lights, alright boys its time to take them off.
---
Honestly I'm the exact opposite, I love a constant spray of Bullets. I'll stick with my Riskrunner and Winter Wolf (I am still salty on the fact I got that from a engram when I was Farming for blueprints for like 3 days...that triple layer RNG sucks) I love both and Will probably be sticking with both for awhile. Now don't get me wrong I have some Hand Cannons and a good sniper I enjoy, just don't use them often and when I do it's for a bit of variety or to complete a quest.
---
When in doubt, FALCON PUNCH!

No offense bro, but that looks like hand suicide

Whoa that‚Äôs wild. For real tho, did you put a mod on it

How do you get symbols in your name like that? I see a lot of folks have it.

Never had a situation where I couldn‚Äôt punch my way out.

Destiny melee is OP
---
In case you want to join my steam account is curry
---
Nezracs sin with void demolitionist smg is just a dopamine surge.
---
I don't really think the word OP seems correct.  It's a Powerful Bow.  Everyone would be super disappointed if it didn't one hit kill guardians in the Crucible.
---
Was this your home?
---
Little salty are we, going out on a limb here and guessing you are a OEM striker titan
---
Consider heading over to the Holliday character in the hangar right away and picking up the legacy Red War campaign, once you get to the tower. It will give you so much context for what is going on. In fact doing all three of the legacy campaigns is probably wise at least on one character. 
---
If you have the time and energy, go to Youtube and find a compilation of what happened in Destiny 1. That too gives lots of context for what is happening in Destiny 2, and who these characters are.
---
Dude, legit I want this. Is it wrong I want this?
---
Oh definitely, think I'm just not used to a hook body shot with a bow
---
1pm EST.  :)
---
Remember when OEM worked with supers and it used to just give you a blanket burst of HP instead of just the overshield?
---
It was impossible to kill any titan super
---
I don't use my abilities too often, mostly gunplay and positioning in pvp. But in pve it's neza with devour and i go add clear. While clearing i get quite a large amount of grenades that i can throw at stronger enemies and i am almost unkillable. My super is just that occasional nuke i can throw at a boss. I personally think having my super less makes it more satisfying to use.
---
So you like to press mouse 1 huh
---
Ignorant
---
Not completely true. There are some other exotics that a NL player can get. Dont know the exact ones though...
---
Then proceed to question, "Is there someone else close by with grenades?"
---
I have it, but why is it good again?  I thought it could shoot very fast but I dont know how to get that to work
---
&gt;Basically it's some hypocrisy going on. 
---
Could be a self call-out!
---
I tried watching the Byf thing and it bored the shit out of me. The portentius-pretentious voice, the "thee and though" (ok, maybe there wasn't any of those but boy did I expect them after a while)... it was a dry recital of facts. 
---
I then found a four-hour long compilation of the cinematics and the necessary gameplay moments with story content for D1 and it was interesting to watch and gave me all the lore I need. I don't need to know the prince's underwear brand, I just need to know where the prince came from and what happened to his sister the queen. 
---
But hey, there are no doubt lore lovers who enjoy that shit. I just want enough context for a non-D1 player to get sort of up to speed enough to play D2 and get some of the references.
---
Both now

You‚Äôre just like, ‚Äúnope nope nope nope nope nope SOOO MUCH NOPE!‚Äù

Oh she is a beast.  Definitely a game changer.
---
when do the weekly reset , Had to 3 vanguard strikes from the tower , is it today ?
---
Hey its free to play right now. You can always download it and see how you feel about giving them more money. I played Destiny2 on the console launch with its lack of content. I quit shortly afterwards never touching the other dlcs. 
---
Then they did crosssave and free to play. So I set up crosssave and transfered my ps4 characters to pc and started playing. I really liked what they did and I grabbed forsaken and shadowkeep immediately. I do not regret it at all. Compared to launch, there is an absolutely crapton of stuff to do now.
---
Also the guy to make you wipe

does the frame need one from the EDZ or is it asking for nessus?
---
Good job! I‚Äôve been getting massacred by these while grinding gambit for the ritual weapons. Do I just need to get the triumph for this or is there a quest pickup that I missed?
---
The weapon core only drops if you have a powerful frame quest, you can't get a bunch of them saved up or anything like that. If you do have the quest and it's still not dropping, check the quest to make sure that you're in the right area because some frames need cores from Nessus rather than the EDZ.
---
No, the screeb had simply already started its suicide attack when OP started his finisher.
---
None taken. It absolutely is.
---
I had the exact opposite happen. I mained warlock through forsaken and started leveling that up to 950. Got a bunch of exotics. Switched to titan and am definitely planning to main that but I'm barely getting any, at least not the ones i want, lol.
---
I was thinking the same thing, it looks like something to do with siva from WOTM raid from D1 doesn‚Äôt it
---
2 minutes later
---
Double Special - where's my ammo?
---
Lmao WHAT
---
Looks like a Quetzalcoatlus
---
holy crap. thank you for pointing that out, im supposed to be on nessus. i was getting really frustrated lol
---
"Parry this, you fucking casual." Haha.
---
It‚Äôs weird as hell, like yeah I‚Äôve unlocked many more exotics on my hunter because of quests or Xur but drop wise I‚Äôve either gotten as many or more in 1/10 the time
---
im in the wrong spot lol i should be on nessus. thanks for pointing it out
---
Like I got an exotic to drop from a capitan from the EDZ story missionüòÇ
---
anti barrier is what i would recommend for pve and backup mag for pvp
---
Is it okay if I don‚Äôt get it üòê I even googled it lol
---
That should get you a perfect score instantly ^^

Very good vid

Flawless Execution: Crouched Presicion kills grant invisibility, wallhacks and a melee attacks that weakens enemies.

---
right click = invis and wallhacks, might also be a short range  AoE attaack (can't remember)
---
left click = Fast forward dash and attack in one.
---
They already addressed it and will patch it soon
---
Those are prime engrams, they have a random chance to drop from powerful enemies (yellow health bar) as long as you have the "prime attunement" buff on your character sheet. The buff is reapplied daily and wears off after something like 3 or 4 drops, it definitely used to be 3 but it seems higher now. Either way, it just means you can still get "powerful gear" in any content even without a weekly challenge.
---
I felt that
---
If only there were signals like "help bank" "help A" etc instead emotes
---
I remember in Y1 Destiny 2 I got 4 exotic engrams saved up and all of them were fucking tractor cannons I still get flashbacks every time I look at it
---
Ahh yeah i think i have that. Thanks
---
i think its actually gonna be fixed in about 3 hours
---
yeah, groups are only trying to 2 tether him
---
no way?
---
Yes, that's something I've noticed as well. The meta is a self fulfilling prophecy in a way; people use it because its commonly accepted as the thing to do and so you see it everywhere, regardless of how strong it actually is. 
---
There will never be perfect balance, and even if bungo somehow managed to get everything in a 0.0001% margin of each other, there would still be youtubers proclaiming that the thing that is 0.0001% better is the new meta and it would be everywhere.
---
I got mine on the Tangled Shore
---
I don't always lose 20 motes but when I do then to the third invader in 50 seconds.
---
Crazy, I got an exotic to drop twice in a row while doing forges. I even mentioned it to my clan thinking the forges were dropping more often. No one else got any and my luck dried up once I mentioned it. I have heard that running the legendary nightfall is the most most reliable way to farm them though, I was going to try that today.
---
It‚Äôs just something that is said. Moons haunted. Moon has hive and wizards and all those monsters on it so it is ‚Äúhaunted‚Äù. Not only that but destiny 2 fan base has been very vocal on NASA‚Äôs twitter.
---
Thanks!
---
Im glad i found a chill clan or not annoying shit like this will happen
---
very nice
---
That's cerainly... *NICE*
---
No and although id like it between console versions but definitely wouldn't want it implemented with the PC port because of m&amp;k, different settings, increased fps and fov and the hackers.
---
Don‚Äôt forget hunters with the worm husk setup
---
I wish I had time in the firefight to communicate or I would have but I think we were all struggling at the time. Ended up losing at the raid game in that round more than anything.
---
I use OEM recluse and striker Titan but luckily for yall im still super shit with all of that
---
Yeah lol I might try it as well, but it‚Äôs weird how inconsistent they drop
---
In about an hour and a half.
---
If we‚Äôre being fair I only used recluse for 1 kill to fully kill them most of the others were finishing a snipe or combining it with a punch
---
Only things i like outside of comp are countdown and mayhem
---
The Last Word
---
Thank you
---
Maybe this is where rob zombie got the idea for living dead girl lol
---
Very much. But probably because it's a classic D1 map I played constantly in Trials and Elim.
---
Genuinely made my day take an upvote
---
I had the problem myself,look in your pusuits for Gambit in its Prime after you're done with the Quest line the cleansing will spawn.
---
GOOOAAALLL!!!
---
They booted u and say it's your fault lol
---
It makes more sense but 1500h in those activities is still a lot I have probably the same in raids with speedrun etc and I consider that more content tbh
---
Didn‚Äôt know it had that firing animation, time to actually finish the quest. Fantastic clip btw
---
It is a bit, they're more than likely using that load out cause it's the easiest way to get kills and win. 
---
Warlocks good too, if you switch to a titan or a hunter your still going to be playing a against titans and hunters with MT,R, OEM etc.
---
Time wasted on destiny
---
Thanks bud, yeah it‚Äôs probably my favorite primary
---
i used to be mad with pvp until i embrace the handheld supernova warlock with max discipline.
---
I used to main warlock up until about a week ago and I never struggled with titans. Handheld supernova is great and all, but it really lacks nova bomb which can wipe anyone straight out of super. Combined with the helm that gives energy back you‚Äôll be a powerhouse.
---
Yet the original tower gets reperairs. Not much but gets

When you put a bowling ball back in the return machine
---
They played him like a damn fiddle and now he approves.
---
The map accomplishes something incredible. It's a large, close range map. There are some greater ranges, but it's mostly a tight map.
---
Unless they‚Äôre a hunter then it one shots

Now if only I found you guys like this for Grenade Launcher kills.

I see, so the intensity of the colour directly influences the intensity of the taste. I think I'm starting to grasp this whole business. I'm going to dub it Cryonology.

Does a powerful drop give you an item that's higher light than your highest item, or does he give you an item that hire light than your average?
---
Oh I see what you mean. I dunno every time I see someone playing crucible on console it looks like everything is just much slower paced.
---
The video looks less of a "look at this cool move I pulled off" and more of a "look at this cool opportunity I found!"  
---
Obviously anyone popping their super could have cleaved through all 6 of these players that mostly weren't even looking at him.  It was the fact that the opportunity existed that made it unusual.  And satisfying.

A great way to build a very strong PC for cheap is to buy a used business machine like a Dell Optiplex from somewhere like ebay with an Intel i5 quad core then buy low to mid end GPU like a GTX 1650 TI or an RX470. You can get a machine that will do 1080p mostly 60fps ultra (and you can go down in settings to high or med to lock 60fps and still have better looking graphics than on console) in D2 for $200-300.

This happens with any enemy. Besides, that bomb wouldn't have killed him on its own
---
Every single gune besides kinetics should be nerfed to make the time to kill like d1. You can just run through d2 1 tapping everything, d1 you had to dump a mag to kill red bar cabal.
---
I mean, claws of wolf isnt that bad. Mountaintop is just an overpowered weapon. Needs a nerf.
---
*cries in poor*
---
Thx man
---
I‚Äôve been wrecked by beloved so many times, what kinetic do you use with it? Would last word be a good pair? I use the peacekeeper exotic so my seal speed to smgs is instant, would you recommend any other weapons to combo?
---
Funny, I thought the glory would take the longest. I had it in an afternoon. I'm still barely over halfway for the others
---
If it is raids, it would be tough.
---
But the way I did in New Light was simply doing 1/2 strikes, 1/2 heroic missions and 1 nightfall according to my power level daily. Daily.
---
Played 2/3 matches of crucible as well. Before doing all that, grabbed all the daily bounties from Shaxx, Zavala and Banshee.
---
Helps to rank up the Artifact, that gets you some bonus power levels.

All of these have matchmaking, so you can go in solo.

Appreciate it!
---
Do you know why? Hunters are the best neutral class in the game...they are perfectly balanced in almost all PvP and PvE activity. They have some of the best damage output builds/supers in the game. The specialist classes of titans and warlocks makes them vulnerable to changes in the game, this was apparent when well and rally barricade lost their auto reload abilities and what did the hunters do? We worked around this by using sealed ahamakra grasps. We rewire the game to suit our needs...that's the Hunter way....supremacy through adversity.
---
Okay, now I don‚Äôt feel so bad when I do the same thing.  Not one kill...lol.

---
Yes with 1-2 you'll triple the dps, I don't even have one and my first max combination with thundercoil/cross counter still hits for insane dps. It's likely he's using arc battery not thunder coil, which makes a big difference.
---
Yeah, first, it would require *some* skill to hit 3 crits ( instead of 2 crits one body), and secondly many of the newer guns completely outclass their old time to kill, such as last word and recluse. With the hand cannon range nerfs, I feel like 180 LH/NF would be no where near as OP as some things we have now.
---
There‚Äôs a blue shotgun called Badlands that‚Äôs pretty good &amp; there‚Äôs also Hawthorne‚Äôs field forged shotgun

It was vernal growth (which I did have) anf neotyric kyot (not sure how to spell it and I‚Äôm fairly certain I didn‚Äôt already have). For my Warlock, I have a full set of inaugural revelry and a partial of vernal growth, but the only ornament I have is optimacy robes.

It‚Äôs easy to get to level 100 anyway I only get 2 hours every evening to play and I‚Äôve already a managed to get to level 102
---
Thank you idk why I passed over it so many times ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Don‚Äôt try it Anakin!
---
Well it's probably safe to assume Thunder Coil won't exist after Season of the Undying
---
Its the old place where the leviathan bot was
---
You mean dodge?
---
Yo real talk I just got Stronghold last night and pulled Crown-Splitter out of the Vault after remembering its a straight up Titan-exclusive claymore, that shit is *hilarious* in pvp, no one‚Äôs ever ready for it.

Ah, another Outlast user like myself
---
Handheld super nova, with whatever these new exotic gloves I have are called. Holy shit, instant one hit kill, half my grenade recharges on hit, and I'm practically invulnerable while charging the nade. I can't stop using it
---
this is a stupid rule. simply snap a pic with your phone is way quicker and easier than having to zoom in/highlight your entire screen cap then having to find where you saved your screenshot in order to upload it to reddit.
---
Quite high since it's past content and bungie love bringing old stuff back and also reskinning!
---
Same issue did the run twice
---
Did the buff make sunshot that much better. Loved it in year 1 but it got overshadowed in year 2.
---
The tree by ikora has it too
---
I did kills first, medals second, glory last. It was interesting
---
I didn't say where it was, because I was not trying to spoil it for everyone. But if you want to know, check the comments!
---
And RAM

Someone is feeling opulent.

---
I gotta say,  I don't even play Titan but I don't blame them for packing good gear.  
---
I recognize it's just a meme to shit on them at this point,  but *this* Hunter Main holds no hard feelings for these guys following a meta.
---
Nut-punched into oblivion
---
It's always been amazing, but now you have 12 shots, which is really good. Also the damage fall off nerfed the other hand cannons, but the explosive rounds damage never falls off. So it inadvertently got a little buff.
---
Me too. But sometimes annoyed at the inconsistency. If bungie never did it, I could probably want DIM to also not do it, just for the sake os consistency. Thanks bungie also changed
---
where do u get that shell tho
---
Yeah, not nearly enough jets of flames in here. OP, take notes.
---
Are you not?
---
In time like this i shit my pants. good thinking!
---

---
It is broke again. No matter what key you insert there will be no progression.
---
I second this
---
But there was another bricks sitting there he ignored
---
Mexican Shaxx!
---
OP ate you using arc battery or thundercoil?
---
The K/Ds of my team's top people. It was a short match.
---
Have you been getting a lot of dragonfly kills?
---
Gotcha, I saw your follow-up post. Good spot!
---
Gambit synths stacking to 999, the change I didn‚Äôt know I desperately wanted.
---
Best time to shop is coming quick! Black Friday/cyber Monday is hands down the best time to purchase parts. 
---
Build your list of what you want in advance, maybe build two entire setups worth, and you can pick the best deal.
---
This, very much this. Can't believe I forgot to put that in my suggestions.
---
Haven't seen any of it but it sounds like a piece of cake compared to Shattered Throne then?
---
Return to Sender medal
---
Excluding exotics, yes. But the Huckleberry is a far better room clearing gun.
---
It's been getting me enough damage on someone nearby to one shot body them, but no actual kills yet. (I've only been able to play 2 whole games without getting kicked)
---
Is that a threat or a promise
---
Neither, that's the Crotinian Chapter, of deathbringer in the season of the undying.
---
Raid loot drops as engrams now instead of directly to you
---
Typical Bungie to fix one problem by entirely breaking another.
---
Insurance money here we come! Santa is bringing the money!
---
As someone who played crucible exclusively, yes. I got frustrated with how imbalanced that piece of armor was at the time and bungies lack of care to address it. I don‚Äôt care much for the pve experience so after a while a moved on to other shooters.
---
Patrick Bateman:  ‚ÄúImpressive. Very nice.‚Äù
---
132546!!!
---
It's basically just plugging things in, and most of the things have a specific connector so you can't really plug anything in wrong. The only thing you could potentially mess up is the CPU and cooler, but even that is pretty straightforward. 
---
And while OP's computer cost a lot, you can put together a decent PC for a lot less.
---
How‚Äôs the dungeon is it as long as the shattered throne??
---
I see. Idk why but I thought I remembered you saying you were a new light player but I guess that was a different post lmao. Also if you're going for a super mobile build dunemarchers are always a good option as well (in case you didnt already know, if you're using bottom tree striker and the thunder coil mod from the artifact you can one shot people with your melee and it's really stupid)
---
Mb ur right
---
Thx bro!
---
This is exactly what I was looking for. Do you have any other suggestions for content creators?
---
You‚Äôd be surprised at how easily I can do the fuck-uperies
---
Just found that out the other day, while going off a cliff.
---
So just here to brag, ok I guess.
---
Do you have a smaller picture?
---
Oh yeah man, I discovered peacekeepers increase sprint speed and all other stuff when you have an smg out, so I‚Äôve been zoomin around with recluse, I might swap up and just punch once for a team wipe xD
---
I would concede that good players are better on hunter, but that at medium-high, medium, and low skill crucible, titans dominate.
---
And what would be the perfect
---
That was the best part. Totally ragdolled into oblivion
---
Oh yeah! Pretty much. I dont see a problem with that.
---
Theyüëèshouldüëèbringüëèbacküëèjacolytes
---
&gt; YOU COULD USE BAD JUJU. AND HOLD THE TRIGGER DOWN FOR ONE TEST, AND TAP THE TRIGGER OTHERWISE!
---
Which would confirm one thing, that the weapon does not in fact have the full auto trait. I dont need to even have the weapon to tell you that. You should try thinking at all before you go off and continue to dig yourself deeper. Thinking for yourself in the sense youre using it applies really well to opinionated topics, not something that can be confirmed or disproved by utilising the scientific method. Also the scientific method doesn't work well when your constant is incapable of having a variable. But hey, continue to get upset and mash down that shift key and assert your dominance by being the loudest fool in the room.
---
Bro I'm right there with you. I have a pc that needs a new power supply. Ordered one, and it arrives 3 weeks ago. Haven't set it up yet because I know SOMEHOW if I do it I'll break it.
---
YESSS
---
Where is the last 1 at?
---
Wow! Thanks for sharing it!
---
I guess I dont see it that way. I know this line has been meme'd to hell but doing things the hard way give me a sense of accomplishment and tbh I could care less what other people do with their money.
---
This guy narrating their movements is so freaking annoying...
---
 I can only buy it for silver? Do I have to do something first?
---
I'm gonna do it.
---
Surprisingly, there are way less furry-hate comments here than on other subreddits.
---
What planet is it on? What waypoint did you use?
---
Now, what do I do with the orb from Anchor? I cant figure it out
---
It‚Äôs a different tab in the shop
---
Why is this actually a thing? Why remove rewards earned by the event by some silly thing that requires a walkthrough to not get stuck inside invisible walls with an invincible one shotting enemy?
---
They actually used to be, but now it‚Äôs just salty kids who aren‚Äôt good enough to win in comp who beat a dead horse. It‚Äôs the people who go for 5 kills with a .33 KD who come into with the ‚Äúhurrrr but OEM broke pls help bungie.‚Äù
---
The memes used to be funny, some still are, but most are just casual players who will always find something to whine about
---
Yes I know it's anecdotal. I'm not denying you, that's why I said "maybe I play different". I don't keep up with streamers and meta.
---
Its Chemical plant

Hi there.. new player myself.. was so into the game, I bought forsaken.. (either that or season pass).. I don't even get TIME for diong forsaken.. due to all the bounties.. I got disllusioned when I spend hours and hours on stuff to get done by a bug, or some horribly amateur ui explanation shit.. I mean, the game is awesome but the presentation of stuff if an absolute DISASTER. once one knows the game of course, one knows every thing so it doesn't matter but what a put off to new players (easily). Why not have all the quests in tabs, one for each planet for example.. why have motes in the synthesiser IN the quests instead of in the inventory; and why does it not always work with the closest mote deposit in the reckoning.. didn't for me, couldn't f*cking figure it out.. OH just works when you run around.. but anyway.. with that said, I wanted a refund of forsakewn (bought it 2 days ago, didn't use it till just now tbh).. but steam apparently said hey you played 2 hours.. fair enough.. I would rather put the money into a season pass and rather grab forsaken later.. I feel if you are grinding bounties and so on, and do a lot of pvp, it would be better doing that and just grabbing forsaken when you finally have come across most of the quests and adventures! With that said, some of the 'bugs' were also partly me being unlucky on when things happened, like I got a telesto and minute later it's banned (for now), some forge shit happened, and I could only REDO same thing (a sniper), THEN the sniper showed up 20 mins later in postmaster and still buyggy, but it made me regret spending money on the forsaken.. BUT, if you can live with bugs, and you like the _exploring_ more than the pvp/bounty grind for now, then grab forsaken now as ever.. in fact, yet another _crap_ thing for a new player.. oh i reset my valor rank, I did some hard thing, that IF I had forsaken, I would have gotten now the chaperon plus another thing.. looks like I have to redo it? It resets after season? Don't ask me, I'm new, and bungie don't seem to give af about _presentation_. So ye, if you are enjoying it, prepare to be a bit horseshat in your face thank to bugs and presentation-might-as-well-be-bugs, grab forsaken now as good a time as any :) but, if you are on the fence, then I'd say, just wait.. I grabbed it thinking oh I want to get like ace of spades as I already am sometimes #1 in the crucibles, but  I'll notice instantly when experienced players are on, and feed me my own peen to my bumhole. I end up last or penultimate or so x Anywayyyyy, you will get enough good weapons _anyway_ to get in well rolled balanced pvp. Ultimately, all this was to say, it's ok to get it.. but don't feel you have to. You might as well grab it in the next season if you ain't sure. (P.S. I am 945 with 2 characters, and forsaken exotic quests anyway are so SH*T hard you won't be able to get them yet imo anyway). Then again, I CAN'T FIND fireteams to do anything anyway :(
---
You can go back to the beginning from the boss to do the puzzles if you have a sticky grenades launcher like mountaintop or prospector
---
You can't really answer that question properly. It depends on a) what kind of games you play b) with settings you run (especially resolution but also details etc) c) which Monitor you have and at how many Hz you run it and d) any additional stuff you do, especially whether or not you stream.
---
Generally speaking a i7-8700 with a 2070 should be a balanced setup for most gaming use cases.
---
Same isssue, maybe they fucked something with the halloween update or the servers are just dying.
---
ANyone who can help me with the shattered wish-ender forsaken quest? Have a feeling I won't be able to do that one solo. :/
---
People talk about the way this game looks literally constantly
---
It's on the moon and it's in the dungeon.
---
Who cares, it‚Äôs not like you can‚Äôt just do it yourself for free and get the gear
---
Any specific build?
---
I would not suggest this roll
---
I usually don‚Äôt either. I guess that‚Äôs why I play lock haha. Regardless not keeping up with the meta doesn‚Äôt stop it from being superior and that‚Äôs what this entire thread and post have been about. An aspect of the meta that is superior in every way, regardless of the fact that someone can do good without it.
---
yes
---
Dont let mobs come to the circle in the middle.
---
How do you make the patrol respawn the fastest
---
I‚Äôm not saying pay or gtfo. It would be great to have more cosmetics through gameplay. I was just saying it‚Äôs pretty damn silly to complain about COSMETICS that aren‚Äôt necessary
---
Full choke not full bore
---
Sweet! It actually looks like it‚Äôs powered by Void energy!
---
This isn‚Äôt even the best dust rock roll
---
I waited whole week to get the obsidian crystal and then lost it by consuming it. This quest is still bugged.
---
No problem man!
---
it's base, not forsaken.
---
üòê
---
Pretty good with the right roll
---
I was ready to double dip mara sovs chest today to grab my Chronicler title but now I gotta wait :(
---
It does not matter if you are 900 or 1500. Shattered thone is capped as any other activity. This new dungeon included, its 960 capped.
---
It‚Äôs a random exotic drop now. Welcome to d2
---
Worked hard for??? 99% of that shit is trash you get from doing other things in game, theonly things of value are the personal buds and the exotics, big whoop.
---
+940 here! Still wondering what is triple tap.. should I tap three times and hope I win ?
---
I get to see my Optimacy icons when I open my inventory now üòçüòçüòç
---
‚ÄúDis bad‚Äù   
---
*plays 10 straight games with loadout*
---
Great point you making here
---
Never knew that about the cursed thrall.  So they pretty much just commit to "honourable" suicide for redemption?
---
I had a guy like this except it was a raid training group XD basically 4 of us had never done a raid one guy I forget who but he was chill as hell basically took us into leviathan the 6th dude had experience and I don‚Äôt know why he was there XD we weren‚Äôt there to farm it. At Calus we wiped like 20 times he screamed at us and quit it was kind of funny actually but yeah.
---
Yea full choke my b
---
Ye omg
---
God roll dust rock blues is full choke accurized rounds slideshot snapshot range masterwork
---
Blind?
---
In the dungeon, of the cliff where you are being chased by ogers. Dont have a picture sorry :/
---
Sounds like you don‚Äôt belong in comp then. ‚úåÔ∏è
---
Because anything they can one shot every enemy in the game is broken..
---
You don‚Äôt look up guides, you go in with no vision of what‚Äôs going to happen and you figure out the mechanics yourself
---
You can do 20+ bounties in a day now. Get more bounties, complete them, see if it works.
---
Crown of Sorrow raid
---
Ty
---
It‚Äôs also great pve does a good deal of damage and if you use it on a boss if I‚Äôm remembering right void weapons will get a damage boost against that enemy.
---
not to mention, getting those crucible/gambit weapons seems to be quite a grind as opposed to purely playing it. I do quite well in crucible (and better in gambit), but I have like 40 glory or something lol.
---
For real, probably people like you playing that made getting my recluse so god damn easy
---
Thanks for not including all titans. We are ashamed of those creatures.
---
*So there is a club.*
---
Overclocked?
---
Also you can climb the tree near Ikora for some candy.
---
It should be a rare thing though or else it would be annoying. Isn't Quickfang the only weapon restricted (to hunters) or are there more ?
---
r/fireteams will hook you up
---
Spoiler tag is pointless if the spoiler is in the title
---
You can buy these with bright dust it costs 6k
---
Thanks for sharing.
---
Beautiful
---
I‚Äôm in so much pain because of this
---
Probably not a couple, maybe 3/4 hours I think. Played a bit of that freelance mode on Saturday night then wrapped it up last night. Was a good time :D
---
I'm calling hacks
---
Scoon poon
---
Interesting, I haven't gone to her yet...too busy with all the other bounties and the event lol.
---
Xur or RNG?
---
Sorry I'm really new. Can you explain?
---
Vibe check
---
To that point, I maxed back at Forsaken.... if it weren't for cross save, I might have never came back however nothing wrong with taking breaks from games.
---
Isn't the draw basically entirely PvE? I don't remember having any problems with it. It's stuff like precision finals blows in crucible that I have problems with.
---
They offer other items by earning them. Like the Auto Rifle.
---
Besides, bright dust is earned in game, technically it‚Äôs not behind a paywall.
---
Purchase season ranks?
---
weird
---
The event is mainly about the masks, forest, and the new auto rifle. Yes the cosmetics are sick, I admit.
---
Yup, time to wait another like month or two for them to fix it again woo, it seems like other steps like the obsidian shard from the rare bounty also isn't giving progress. So all in all, they fixed one bug and created a bunch of others.
---
It‚Äôs very nice shaded
---
You absolutely can hit it in sync every time.  Test it out, when you get a feel for the weapon, you can fire it at exactly the same RoF as if it had full auto.
---
You have private matches, you can test this yourself.  People already have tested this as well and came to the same exact conclusions.
---
RNG is basically random drops.
---
Xur is a exotic vendor who shows up on Friday at reset time (1pm EST) and leaves on Tuesday ast reset.
---
you need to complete the quest from eris, then you can access it from orbit
---
Yeah when you go to seasons I saw purchase season rank for 100 silver now it‚Äôs mysteriously gone
---
No you still had to get kills in PvP with deaths setting you back. That was trivial though. It‚Äôs more the mission with the rather annoying mechanic.
---
I would have banned you too üòÇ
---
Oh, okay. Thanks!
---
Augmenting weapons is basically just picking a specific loot pool from some past activity that it allows you to and rolling weapons from that pool and they can roll with more perks to choose from. It does not allow you to reroll your already existing weapons AFAIK
---
They made it so the season pass is account bound. So we can only game share the expansions, not the pass.
---
Damn that‚Äôs amazing
---
Region chest
---
This guy gets it!
---
They were squeakers so definitely younger than 13. Had to turn my volume down to 5 for it to be bearable
---
It was accidentally activated today. They removed it as they did not intend to roll out that feature until later in the season.
---
Ok sorry for bothering people
---
But its breaking the games rules so as i see it.its fair play
---
Yeah idk how this hasn't got fixed. It's so broken. Only way you can lose with this is if your teammates are legit trash cans.
---
Okay so saying later in the season is that in the next few weeks or?
---
I love this a little too much
---
It‚Äôs only because the knockout buff keeps refreshing
---
They didn‚Äôt say yet
---
What‚Äôs the shader called?
---
Ah yes I forgot how difficult it was to understand the big red enemy repeatedly killing you after the announcer tell you he's coming.
---
Found this in the angry door section, as well as hidden on a cliff near Omar Agahs ghost in the new dungeon close to a giant worm skeleton, any theories, or translations would be appreciated ^^
---
It is with weapons of light
---
**Bungie:** We take concerns about cheaters very seriously. As a result we'll be nerfing fusion rifles and sidearms by 30%.
---
More like youre just a fucking entitled tool.
---
Probably the Bahamas
---
Totally not in a private match........
---
Oh lord. Im only 13 and wayy more calm than that.
---
Exactly
---
*nice*
---
Where is the badge for that broom ?
---
You‚Äôre not in a private match
---
If it kills, it kills
---
I main a hunter, but everytime I see a post like this is can't help but talk shit just because I'm so sick of them. Thing is, I never seem to have that much trouble with OEM titans. Just disengage until the over shield wears off. It's not that big of a deal to me. And you know what eles besides the mountaintop is a one shot kill? Every other single shot grenade launcher and a bunch of fusion rifles. I hate Jotunn in pvp more that MT, OEM and Recluse all combined.
---
This is what I like to see
---
