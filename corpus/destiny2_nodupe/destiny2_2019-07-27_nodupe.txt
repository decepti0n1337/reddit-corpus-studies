Has this not been fixed yet? I'm building a pc before Shadowkeep comes out and was leaning towards the 3700x
---
Now I know why it takes forever to load my inventory—my Ghost’s handling is too low!
---
I was hoping that the fix would be a combination of both the original perk and the rework. IE. you can proc release the wolves by holding R for 5 seconds but ONLY after getting a kill. To me this sounded like a way to fix it but it might be op :shrug:
---
Ayy the Regime is great tho
---
Yeah, but theres better
---
Scavenger perks do not affect the wall brick
---
The second wall tho

*To qualify for the “Prismatic Inferno” emblem, players must have finished a Crucible match between 10 AM PST December 8 and 10 AM PST December 12 2017.*

Alright bro, I'm boutta head out

More Hz only truly helps if your computer can actually get your fps that high.  Refreshing the screen more often than the video card can draw does nothing for the image quality .  The same is true of fps that is higher than the Hz of your monitor, the extra frames are dropped.   144hz monitors let you use more of the frames your gpu renders.  I doubt you can see any benefit from more Hz beyond that.

Last night I had a great match in IB, was nailing headshots across equinox left and right, ended with a 12.0 rating. Next game, joined a match in progress and proceeded to get super chain-killed for the next few minutes. That match I had a 0.41 kda.
---
Who wouldnt
---
Bungie's taking it beyond small sparrows
---
3rd step is the tedios one, the melee and super are ez but the grenades are over the top
---
Yeah, the quest was brutal, but definitely worth it.
---
you’re among friends here. it’s a safe space for us all ha
---
It doesn't give more rewards so you want to reset
---
Not everybody has insurmountable skill and time to get those perks so they may not be noobs, but people grinding as quick as they can before work and/or life.
---
I have hardly seen it myself.  No one really wants to throw away their humanity (jojo!) in crucible rn
---
yea im still stuck on 3rd step on about 70% after about 30 games since grenades are so shit
---
Feel free to keep it max, but if you want to get Redrix then you gotta reset 5 times in one season
---
I went into a Gambit game and got the whole opposing team to fuse while I was invading
---
Has xur stopped selling forsaken exotics?
---
Exotics aren't inheirantly supposed to be better than every other option just because of the fact that it's an exotic. If that's really the case, i'd like you to explain why it's miles ahead of Sunshot, Malfeasance, and Crimson.
---
Just bc it’s a teen ur doing a raid with doesn’t mean that ur gonna have a bad time, just a stereotype.
---
What? You haven't even begun. Your commitment isn't there. Try 375 packages.
---
I like this ad
---
Hunters - bullshit kills Warlocks - a big ass crutch Titans - "PUNCH EVERYTHING !!!!!!"
---
which is designed after the Stranger's Rifle
---
It does. I’ve got to do everything on Nessus. Just bought the fates engram from cut on earth and it didn’t count so it either doesn’t count flat or it needs to be on Nessus
---
Yeah bro same :( my partner is going to have the emblem but not me bc I chose to let a friend use my PS4 to play on their account with them.
---
Oof rake cactus has stolen your meme
---
[removed]
---
 This deserves more attention. I would be happy to support this for MOTW! Nay, MOTY
---
Indeed. This day extracts a heavy toll.
---
Which is the precursor/legendary to No Time To Explain and so forth
---
Nice dodge. It's what I like to do with my warlock and just blink over them and gtfo
---
I fucking love the lore of this game... bingos really did a great job
---
I haven't been able to do a single raid because of it, when people explain and I say what? It turns into fast and the furious for whoever leaves first
---
You could just bank on the game not registering melee hits 90% of the time. Seems to work for everyone else.
---
Hey me too! What the fuck is it? Why were there so many angry firey guys?
---
Its not a god roll what are you talking about
---
Weren’t you just venting about COMP being hard?
---
Be honest. How fun is top tree sentinel with OEM? I thought it would be dirty since you deal more damage with an overshield iirc, and the melee *also* applies a shield. 
---
Just not sure how it stacks compared to Hammers. Since sentinel hit detection is a bit... off.
---
if only Cayde did that....
---
I’m going for the mmxix, at 13/24 and halfway through the harder ones, main problem I have are going out of my way todo the raids.

Idk what “llk” means tbh

If your low on blue gear it's a fantastic farming point. Roughly one blue every 15 - 20 mins!
---
Length does indeed matter
---
Broke his ankles
---
Heavy not available? Tatara gaze with box breathing
---
Unpopular opinion: Guns that get nerfed should be added as original to a special mayhem type crucible where everyone is armed with the same OP gun each round
---
People don’t understand not to shoot, and it feels great to show a no skill blade their place, also if you take any damage from rthe front while blocking you one shot supers, melee supers don’t realize this so abuse it.
---
Best looking Titan exotic, just wish it was more useful

Kill by ThreeXChar.

Lololololololol.

I still haven't gotten my Suros Arsenal Pack

I've said this season sucks because of Lord Of Wolves but then started using it myself so there is go I guess mr investigator lol

Can't aim for sh0t? Punch to death with liars handshake equipped...

What's the roll? Just curious.

No

Upvoting for fellow izanagi user
---
Yikes LOW user....
---
Wait. More free stuff and the stuff you have pay for will most likely be on sale.
---
Double kills with a breach nade launcher is hard as hell, best way to go about it is to killsteal like no tomorrow
---
I would pay an obscene amount of money for that.
---
No, no they are not made for 6v6. If at any point you wind up with "Finding Location To Spawn," then the map might be fucked up. The _only_ map I can think of that's reasonably okay for 6v6 is the indoor Titan map.
---
Get your Ethernet cables ready boys
---
Kinda surprised that his version wasn’t somehow 12 minutes long..
---
I know damn well they aren’t. I’m one of the few that liked 4v4 with 2 primaries. I mean if they had rr it would have been much better but the amount of shotgun apes just annoys me and just hearing vwoop and your dead from 40 m is just not fun
---
Hrrnng, Zavala, I'm trying to sneak around.... but I'm dummy thicc and the clap of my ass cheeks keeps awaking the hive
---
Yea but that super does that to me on the regular even in qp. Clearly swipe a player and they take 0 damage.  How!? The need to revamp the hit registration
---
I guess you could say.... destiny 2 is at a.... all time LoW
---
But LOW is insanely easy to get compared to the lens. Lens was just a random drop while doing wanted bounties will get you LOW really fast. I think I did 5 on my account to get it and it dropped on the third one when I did my brothers account
---
What are you ? Some kind of Evangelion ?
---
I did use one eyed tho
---
It increases the timer for String of Curses.
---
It's noticeable.
---
What raid can you to bubble titan ?
---
feelsbadman
---
Ah, well something had to be done solo
---
Pro gamer move right there
---
Stop stop stop please I was so bad back then they were so ducking hard
---
That’s illegal.
---
Just use master worked weapons and don’t die. If your weapon drops orbs, then that’s a multikill.
---
This post singlehandedly multiplied my hatred for fusions.
---
I agree, I wanna spin my gun to look like a badass
---
This nigga said Shadow Clone Jutsu
---
I'll never look at those Psions the same again
---
Another Q:
---
 if i reached fabled this season and i want to work on luna‘s howl and i went down from fabled .. do i need to reach fabled again for luna‘s ?
---
No one:
---
Mountaintop and rec 
---
Thnxxx bruh i appreciate that
---
Whats the name of th sword?
---
No it’s retroactive but you have to get Lunas this season otherwise you’d have to get fabled again
---
Buying seeds and opening engrams on Mercury.
---
If you finish all the steps before the end of this season then you do not need to reach fabled again
---
It stared back - from leviathan raid
---
afk forge farming?
---
You could say its a.. perfect paradox
---
Simply lower your light level, and then load into a forge, dont need to play, just left it on, the mission will failed but u will get small amout of resources.
---
I have a LoW but didn’t even realize it. It’s been sitting in storage for god knows how long. I like to believe I’m a solid Gambit player, but I have just always sucked at pvp. I enjoy it now and then but it’s not something I do a lot of. Been practicing with Erentil and I refound my love of fusion rifles. Have to give a speech at a seminar today, but odds are I’ll spend the rest of the day shooting shit online. Let’s see if I find my way back into the Crucible
---
Me too! Was my first instinct; to find someone correcting the spelling mistake. Lol.
---
Xbox
---
Can you DM me an invite
---
Just need your bnet (psn or whatever username you originally signed into Bungie with)
---
PC is the smallest population, and the game shouldn't be balanced around it.
---
Gotta leave my old clan real quick
---
Na, I’m good.
---
*looks at my tractor that i was already running almost always* well another spin
---
The taken spam their abilities way too much.
---
Seen taken captains literally do nothing but darkness blast a friend of mine behind a rock on io for 20 minutes. No shrapnel launcher, no teleporting, just darkness blast.
---
Same with knights spamming their fire. Seen 3 knights in gambit launch flames literally endlessly and wipe our entire team because the flame was just unavoidable.
---
Oh I blame me.
---
I wasn’t expecting it at all.. I completely ignored destiny until this summer. It still hurts playing through strikes that include him.
---
Why be a dick and not help the guy?
---
I saw an LFG on Xbox the other day that said only "13 or younger" and it blew my mind
---
Idk some people are just like that, I personally like sherpa’s
---
"It's magic. I ain't gotta explain shit."
---
Where did you get this. I want it
---
Warlocks are best for PVE and hunters are in between. Also values like recovery and stuff will never be very significant. Going from 4 recover to 6 isn’t going to be that signiicant. Going from 0 to ten will. Hunters start out with more mobility, Titans ressilience and warlocks recovery. Even if you don’t notice, most of the time you are faster than the other two classes. 
---
Let me know if you have any other concerns
---
I find it funny for some reason. It emphasizes that what is happening is over the top or unnecessary. Ironically, a lot of people seem to find the “no one” bit to be over the top and unnecessary
---
Gimme dregs promise pleeeees
---
Do you though? Do you really?
---
Respect to titans who play anything other than bottom tree striker
---
No, it isn't.
---
Imagine playing as a ghost
---
Legit makes me wonder if it was always a thing and Bungie knew. Because...many of the VoG guns had those “suppressors” on them making them longer.
---
*Moon Lord has awoken*

I'm really excited to try it on PC

Imagine playing as the traveller

what level / power are you?
---
Put your energy weapons in your vault in the tower.
---
Dismantle or put in your vault
---
There are 3 each season. This one is the second.
---
Go to the tower and access your vault
---
Sorry my Bad, i have Outlaw and Rampage
---
0 range
---
When you hover over weapons, see how it says to press and hold a button to dismantle. You can also put them in the vault, accessed from the farm social space.
---
you will have to either put it in the vault in the tower,or dismantle it
---
1 Dismantle one
---
2 Use the bungie app amd transfer one to your vault
---
3 Leave it and once you go to orbit it will go to the post master and you can pick it up later once you vault or dismantle other items.
---
Wouldnt say its god but it is a good roll. great to shut down supers however,those chances may only come around a few times a match but, with the current meta, shutting down a striker can be very useful.
---
Come on guys stop laughing it's not that small I just got out of the pool
---
Sunshot ghost
---
Shit I'm stupid. It doesn't give you a prompt to dismantle when the weapon is equipped.
---
it's an issues with the pursuit tab. make sure to turn in any bounties you complete mid match. if they're invisible, I think I saw a video that said all you need to do is open the pursuit tab and close it. to be fixed on Tuesday tho.

Oh ok. If you ever feel like raiding in the next week, I’ve got a few friends that can help out. My GT is Z3phrr
---
Guardians die we get resurrected. Simple
---
Play with friends and get always the heavy and do it in comp you need only 100 kills as i know in comp
---
I use it all the time yesterday i used it for gambit to destroy the primeval I use it for nightfalls and it gives the buff to all your teammates you can’t deny that when I fire tether and hit body shots there’s a yellow hit damage
---
I solod up to 3k... it's awful now lmao
---
Rekt m8
---
Do it in comp you dont need so many kills in comp
---
The prime evil is technicaly a major when it comes to tether. I mean bosses in a raid
---
Check out braytech.org . It'll tell you exactly what you're missing.
---
You have to be joking. Where the hell have you been for the past month?
---
That was really rough to read
---
My problem is that my rocket launcher that has tracking can be easily dogged but a fusion rifle has tracking and you can’t doge it
---
So you want a knife?
---
No wonder Rose feels so good to use
---
You should say what platform you are on, so people know if they can play with you or not.

Coulda just grinded instead of doing the story
---
The math nerd inside me is bothered by the 360/4 since that equals 90.  It should be (number of favorable outcomes)/(number of total outcomes).  You accidentally did the reciprocal and if you did 360/4, it would imply the catalyst has a 9000% chance of dropping.
---
Nah they're missing nechrocasm and zhallo super cell
---
PUNCH EVERYTHING.
---
Dudde i completed more than 20 games this week but one of them when i was at brave lost my internet connection but i rejoined into the game do i still getting the bonus ? I mean that not counting as leave right ?
---
The gally always returns. It’s boring at this stage.
---
They drop randomly from strikes, crucible and other world events just like D1 but there are also quests to get certain exotics also like D1. 
---
And if that fails just go to Xur. Again, also like D1.
---
I read the lore book and I loved it
---
Made a Freudian mistake. I read Dattoo first
---
MR. TORGUE APPROVES
---
What a dick for not wanting to spend more time teaching a raid right? How dare people have limited time to play, what dicks

Wow, you’re so good at bland non substantial comments

Tell me, where’d you learn to be such a smug bridge troll from?

Whoops, my mistake. Fixed it.

And laser tag! :D

Yes

How ?

“Did you shit yourself againnnnn? Yesssssss”

Sweet Business and Colony catalyst drops, so far. Rng is rng
---
If you want to discuss why badlander is obsolete then i will gladly humor your wishes. But snarky remarks add flavor to discussions and debate, there no need to be formal online. And who cares about rudeness online lmao. 
---
Oh and btw relevance and relevancy are the same thing, if you want to attempt to call out grammar in an online thread maybe you should spell check first... snarky***
---
Go talk to Shaxx. He's got the pinnacle quests just below the daily bounties.
---
Ok cool thx
---
Yep, any shotgun with slideshot and rampage is obsolete. Look how obsolete it is in the video. So obsolete. In fact, it was obsolete in the 4 games won after too.
---
Like I said, just a bitter envious turd. At least recommend something that you deem to be soooo much better.
---
Hand cannon with a bayonet.
---
D2 Noob here, what do the catalysts do?
---
I see. i dont play on PC so i didnt know. thanks for the info.

True

---
OMG I wonder why people who obviously don't play a game or know its community, spend so much time shitposting about it.
---
Genuinely thought people were hacking but had the switch weapon glitch also fun times lol
---
Don’t get me started on grandes lmao
---
If it's the last round and we are getting stomped I reserve the right to make my character dance until the end of the game
---
pc is way faster paced and it's very fun. jump on it once cross save is implemented for sure.
---
cringe
---
Shadow keep Isn’t even out yet-_-
---
I don't think it's solely don't to people doing it willingly.......but at the same time I have no sympathy all the same especially after I had a fireteam that feel victim to this and had the wiseguy actually try to join after we already lost a match.
---
I appreciate it my dude Love their music
---
Bosses didn't die in 5 seconds in D1 either.
---
The “actually” part is fair lmao, but the whole topic of the thread is how barrel length equals more range, which is how real guns work
---
Check out this virgin
---
- The first Season Pass included Curse of Osiris and Warmind, the first 2 DLC's. 
---
- Now, these are included in the first big Expansion that Destiny 2 got which is Forsaken. 
---
- In addition to Forsaken, Bungie released the Forsaken: Annual Pass. This includes extra Content which was released during three seasons, the Season of the Forge, the Season of the Drifter and Season of Opulence (current season). All of this Content is still available and won't go away (apart from the time-limited Events like the Revelry or the Dawning).
---
- The next upcoming thing is Shadowkeep, the next big Expansion for Destiny 2. This Expansion will release in September and does not require Forsaken, it's separate from it. 
---
If you want to get all available Content, you should get the Complete Collection of Destiny 2. As I'm writing this, I'm not sure if it includes Shadowkeep, but I don't think it does. So you'll have to buy Shadowkeep separately (remember: Shadowkeep is not active right now, it will release in September).
---
Not that I’m complaining. There aren’t enough for me.
---
Hand cannons only! Heavy hand cannon please!
---
Yeah, the first quest step gives boots. From then until you compete the next quest step, only boots will drop from Saladin. Complete that one and you'll only get boots plus whatever is rewarded from the second step. Etc.
---
Idk why I get booted usually with chard error I believe I struggle to get threw a full night sometimes so strange cause other times it's fine
---
There is a resident in the convalescent home where I work at with that name lol
---
By the time it was discovered though I was already max level. I’m just saying, even if it was never removed (which, it was only reduced), it never had much impact on the game.
---
I can get through my Well-Rested levels in a few hours of real grind. The exp throttle, if I remember right, was specifically to counteract infinite mob farms, which are not “standard grind” anyway
---
If by upgrade you mean masterwork, don’t. Masterworking is incredibly expensive, and should only be done to perfected god rolls
---
I want to clarify. The possibility of getting weapons is reduced. Ex. I turned in 100 salad coins and got 4 sets of boots and a maul.
---
Yeah now all I have to do is wait til my access restriction ends so I watch the game throw me into multiple matches of control where my team can't cap for shit while the opposing team keeps getting power plays, or get thrown into Clash and watch as the opposing team go on 15-0 run before my team can get a single kill.
---
Or have that one instance when I either get loaded into a losing match or another where one of my teammates will drop out of the match regardless of whether we're winning or losing.
---
Not crapping on you for the motivation but there's only so many  times you can get kicked in the teeth before you decide you don't want to live the rest of your life eating soft foods.
---
That’s not really how it works lol, no game ever created has even close to the same number of concurrent players as sales. A decent chunk of people will buy a game and play it for an hour and say “not for me” and eat the loss. I’ve done it, we’ve all done it. Not to mention that it’s been 2 years
---
Easier said than done
---
I really hate the gaming community sometimes. No wonder everyone hates us
---
Joker’s Wild was part of Forsaken. CoO was just it’s own thing.
---
Sparrow, but smol
---
I’ve had that happen, different weapon, but same idea
---
Lmao gottem
---
Acolytes are the Stormtroopers of Destiny
---
I need one, NOW
---
What’s advertised vs what you get
---
Goddamnit
---
It’s good in certain situations. Tight spaces filled with ads. They get cut down by the Explosion really easy. So yeah really good against Hive thrall rushes.
---
It’s not where I live it’s just the fact that my computer is connected using a dogshit cheap WiFi adapter. I’m trying to get Ethernet soon if I do I can get around 10mbps so shit will download at a reasonable speed.
---
Thats crazy, that little of recoil on something other than PC..nice roll
---
Wow, I wish I hadn't read through that. 
---
I don't get the mentality of someone to just bash on something they don't like. I despise Fortnite. So you know what I do? Keep my ass away from anything related to the game and focus my attention on things I do like.
---
Hard to tell, but I definitely did it across two seasons, plus I did it legit. There are ways to cheese it, but you have to look that up yourself
---
*INDEEDING INTENSIFIES*
---
*Titan when holding forward doesn’t work*
---
“HACKERS”
---
That COE guy sounds really pathetic, christ.
---
For the catalyst to level up, you actually have to use the y1 drang.
---
The perks for both guns work while it’s a calus drang, but you don’t get progress towards the catalyst, it has to be the fixed roll drang from collections 🤙🏼
---
Who wouldn’t want that sparrow?
---
Best week of Trials imo
---
No I should’ve worded it better I just played a lot of trials during year one so that was basically my crucible
---
Fuck i thought this was a new Husky Raid video and I got excited :(
---
Never disrespect the legendary Gjallarhorn like that.
---
Later tag was some of the most fun I’ve had in destiny
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
Is it good? I have one with rampage and outlaw
---
It hit the highest it was since launch not long ago. Guaranteed it’ll get even higher than that come Shadowkeep
---
When you get yours, you should definitely go for the catalyst, trust me, this thing feels really good even without it.
---
With the Burger King colors
---
No. Just in your collections. You can even delete it from your vault and it will still drop. As long as you got the exotic at least once and have it in your collections.
---
Well how else do you explain getting matched with a group of people who don't cap in control or the occasional instances when a player from your team will drop out lose or win?
---
If this game had no player base I'd never see people and waiting for matches would take forever. If this game were "Under optimized" I would never be able to play it, even on my older hardware I ditched a month ago. Then theres the "Secret XP reduction"; Why does that even matter? You know, beyond feeling like game is playing itself for you?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Would love to know which half wit twit wrote this.
---
Honestly,it was toxic but fun
---
Same issue, no mics vs mics and Coordination
---
You can look at it like that, but you still had to pay for Jokers wild as well as forsaken. You could get forsaken and opt out of the 3 dlcs from the annual pass
---
The roll I got isn't good, rampage and triple tap, but I'm stoked that I got it regardless! I've been waiting forever to be able to get it!
---
I'm jealous of your roll!
---
Can’t get glory in comp. and I am not aging get rid of it as it is, I’m only suggesting adding a team free lobby.
---
I haven't even reached the 250 strikes triumph yet, so I guess I shouldn't complain
---
