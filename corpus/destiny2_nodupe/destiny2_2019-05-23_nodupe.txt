You‚Äôve restarted the pc I assume?
---
---
---
titans have the best neutral game all around with things like skullfort wrecking shit in pve and ofc there's oem in pvp. but titan supers are ridiculously underwhelming in pve endgame stuff, which is a damn shame
---
No one uses it because of the grind lol no one has that much free time
---
PvE stomp meta is too strong and has been around fot 4 years
---
How would you know? I bet you don‚Äôt even have broadsword! And when you say yes you may be lying so...
---
Pic restart did it. That was very weird. Never seen that happen before
---
Pvp sorry for the late response.
---
Every match I‚Äôm in ever. Horrible.
---
Congrats. Thats one hell of a grind.
---
Do you not play this game?
---
Is silver gone? Maybe it didn‚Äôt actually go through
---
When you buy packs there will be a box in your inventory. Did you open it?
---
yes, silver is gone, and so is the package in the eververse menu
---
Plenty of time to decide whether it's better or worse without the hunt mechanic.
---
No I only have 6 Titles from spectating
---
there is a box in my inventory. Thank you. That's what I was missing.
---
Sleeper
---
Uh what about synthoseps
---
I was thinking about using an Arial warlock build because if I'm shooting straight down on an enemy it has a high chance of hitting them again because it would bounce straight up
---
Uh what about synthoceps
---
Synthoceps after the first buff have always been top tier... If you don't have an exotic in mind, use those.
---

---
If you're looking to spam Melting Point w/ the hammer Titan, go with Stand Asides
---
Those things are so sexy. I'm cool with a random mail gift.
---
Orimund‚Äôs Anvil (the 450 auto rifle) was never brought forward to Y2 so it hasn‚Äôt been available since Forsaken dropped.
---
If you‚Äôre talking about the T2 version of Orewing‚Äôs Maul (the breech-loaded grenade launcher) then that should still be in the loot pool next season.
---
Fast and neat
---
Yes, [these are the only things that go away when the season changes.](https://old.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/bp0vzv/a_list_of_everything_disappearing_when_the_new/)
---
When I find afk players I try to fist bump. If they don't reciprocate I stab em in the face, same as real life but I get in trouble then for some reason.
---
Oh, I heard they got rid of factions. I'm new to D2. Just Talk to Hideo?
---
I've been partial to my DFA since I got that to drop just before Warmind, but I did main my trusty Origin Story up to that point!
---
And I totally agree... have to admit to being a little salty after learning how easily the Forsaken supers could pop the bubble. The buff they gave it definitely helped a lot. Also helps now that I'm a bit more skilled at spotting someone setting up to Blade Barrage me, or I use it to purposefully bait supers instead of hold down a zone like you could in Y1.
---
Really hoping we get some more creative bubble exotics in the future!
---
slap that like button like ya mama taught ya right
---
No, factions are still there. They just shut them down for now. I played back when tehy were still active, and got that shader, so now it's available in my collections.
---
... I got it. a bubble that suppresses whwn an enemy enters.
---
I get way more hate mail running a sniper than I ever do sweating my dick off with Chaperone and Luna's, and I'm utter shit at sniping
---
Oh ok. Tyvm for answering üôÇ
---
Got major anxiety when you didn‚Äôt reload TLW and just ran into the next battle
---
The first DLC from that, Black Armory, adds a lot to farm and grind for and a new raid. The second, Joker's Wild, is mainly Gambit focused, but only kinda adds more to that and a new horde mode. The third is coming out next month. I'd recommend picking up the Annual pass since it'll keep you busy all the way up to September when the next big DLC will come out most likely.

Doom fang commander

Punch refund grenade

Grenade refund punch
---
Wash rinse till super
---
That's pretty slick.
---
Nah, people just need to use the setting that's best for them. I play on xbox and I don't have any complaints about the sensitivity options.
---
Yeah, but have you ever played kinda drunk and lost 15 motes?!
---
All the things.
---
Don't you fucking dare mention the n-word on the neutral game. It's all the tree has going for PvE (Super is anemic for PvE).
---
Still do...
---
What would you consider to be the best roll with supremacy?
---
Happy cake day, Guardian!
---
Myelin Games is another great one. Slightly lower production quality, but he knows his stuff. Beard Grizzy is there too, but I have a hard time listening to him since he goes on LOTS of tangents. Evade does lore too, but he sometimes confuses some established lore, so I question his conclusions.
---
I noticed rahools legendary engrams only dropped y1 loot.
---
That‚Äôs where I got mine right before forsaken dropped
---
1 for the ship and 1 for the sparrow. Took me 3 game on a weak curse week. This thing happened rigth after I got malfeseance
---
Cool thanks!
---
"Ooooh here I go killin' again!"
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure the ‚Äúold fashion‚Äù HC will not be available if you haven‚Äôt already acquired it in Y1.
---
U can obtain the recluse in S7 when u didn't reach 2100 glory thus season or it will decay because of the triumph... It's a S6 triumph and we don't no what happened in S7 with the old things
---
Plenty od outside use Ace of Spades, Last Word, Outbreak, and Breakneck.
---
Breakneck???
---
Gambit auto rifle, long quest to get it.
---
LeMonarque, for me at least.
---
There's probably lots of spelling mistakes in here... :T
---
nice you popped an ult that tracks people
---
But did you throw enough grenades
---
Is it me or was TLW hits hard in D1?
---
It takes at least two months, maybe more, I can‚Äôt remember when I ordered mine but it was a long ass time ago and they arrived the other day.
---
I‚Äôm kinda pissed actually because they almost got sent back, why? Because Bungie never once emailed me to say they‚Äôd been fucking shipped. I had no idea they were at the post office til they called they sent me a message threatening to return to sender.
---
Bungie are trash at that kind of correspondence, I got an email to say my Lore book had been shipped about 2 weeks after it arrived...
---
WOO! A WHOLE TEAM OF GUARDIANS IN THE DIRT!
---
August 30th last time I checked.
---
I agree, just make all the guns the same, they can just look different. remove Exotics completely, who needs them when they are useless and you can only wear one, and if one is slightly better it will become Meta and be Nerfed. Also remove the option to Solo some things because without gear that's powerful it's not really worth trying anymore. Maybe remove 50% of my shields and HP as well, I mean yea I kill gods and save planets but I really don't like feeling powerful at all. Actually remove my abilities and Super as well, just creates situations like this.
---
D1, but still an awesome comeback
---
He must of been like:where tf is this coming from?
---
[it used to do 111 on a hip fired headshot, this was first week trials so there was light level. ](https://imgur.com/gallery/oHDpqfM)
---
As a golden gun main, it really pisses me off seeing how powerful other supers in the game are.
---
Yeah, but the problem is that some of them will now like the cramped fighting, so it annoys us but is fun for them. So unless they add a 4v4 casual mode the best bet is rumble really
---
I have the exact same roll too.
---
This needs to go on a subreddit of most satisfactory clipsüò© so beautifulüò™
---
Any tips for using that super?
---
Good lord, I don‚Äôt play dawnblade, or warlock often, but that mobility after casting super is INSANE!
---
bad spawns are the biggest issue in this mess honestly, i've lost count of the number of times i've spawned in the exact same spot only to get sniped instantly, repeatedly until the sniper ran out of ammo. supers with quick map traversal just compounds the problem
---
Don't miss.
---
Even in gambit, the moment a nova warlock gets his super with the ahamkara skull, it's game over, it's so ridiculous that armour is borderline broken.
---
AGREED. It should not be possible to spawn in line of sight of an enemy. I can't count the number of times I've sniped someone who still had their overshield on from spawning in, it's unacceptable
---
Yea ik exactly what u mean hunters have it rough
---
Oh yeah. I've bombed a group, half cleared it, got bomb back, fully cleared the wave, rinse and repeat until primeval spawns and the other team is only halfway there. It really is silly. Fun, but just a tad broken
---
THIS\^ is what people are missing. ace will still be able to two tap with every other damage buff in the game, OeM didnt do this to any other weapon, just ace.
---
darci does about 1-2% more dps than whisper so i wouldnt say its "way better"
---
I punch your powers
---
Neither did your comment lul
---
Ok cool u think you can send me them
---
That‚Äôs rad, maybe edit in the electric field that surrounds a player using their arc super to have all 3 classes displayed. I remember using the arc emote on my Titan with my solar or void super up and it looks so cool, this is next level.
---
Please remember Primeval Damage is not a measure of damage done to the Primevals Health,  rather a measure of engagement proportional to your fireteam. 
---
You could just as easily had 20% damage through the same 60 bullets if your team did more. Or even 90% of your team did less.
---
Thanks man. I was trying to get some resemblence of electricity in After Effects but I couldn't quite make it work. I'll definitely try to use the standard effect in game though.
---
of course because it triggered every primary shotgun user on this sub.. 
---
which is almost the entire sub.
---
im sorry i have better taste in gameplay then to think i have a big dick for warrioring scrubs with a shotgun. after all shotgun is a high standard for you people. yikes
---
I imagine Y3 is when valor alternative quests for the y2 pinnacle glory weapons will be introduced. Probably one each season with s8 being a LH and adding random rolled barrel, ammo and MW (giving you the potential to get a NF equivalent from crucible packages), s9 giving mountaintop, s10 giving recluse and s11 giving whatever the upcoming glory crucible weapon is.
---

---
As soon as you reach level 50, talk to the Drifter. He will have some blue Power Surge bounties. You can do these once per character, and they will give you blue gear at power level 640 no matter what your current power level is. After that, increase your power level exactly the same way as before (meaning, do activities that list "powerful gear" as the reward, and kill things until prime engrams drop).
---
This was posted for humor's sake based on a meme I saw called "The F@ckening" . No whining here as I still play the game as often as I can . Is there any particular reason you were triggered or are you just rude to everyone?
---
Samsung T5.
---
Type that into Amazon's search bar. They start around $87.00.
---
Thanks mate I'll have a look!
---
Rule 6.
---
Even if you suck with it, it's just so damn fun.
---
Super slick moves bro.
---
Wow! Thanks! Good Fight!
---
Not sure about exchange rates but I got a Samsung internal 1tb at b and h for $160.00. No complaints
---
Nope
---
Not trolling. Trying to be funny ( and failing obviously ) . Will definately try harder next time.
---
No bait. Failed attempt at humor.
---
I've got the 500 Gb version. I think it was $94.00. The price fluctuates, so check once a week!
---
Fairly good! AUS$ or US?
---
I said that people use it, not that it's inherently good lol I like it on control, since rampage takes down multiple enemies quicker. Autos are fine in pvp, there's just no crutch weapons in the class. Ringing Nail and Misfit tear ppl up if used properly. And origin story was all over the place back in the day.
---
Amazons choice is currently sat at ¬£95.49 down from ¬£178! That's a 500gb t5

---
Alternatively, killing the blockers could work too
---
Would prefer to drop by the Iron Temple and borrow one of Lord Saladin's wolves to sic on a dreg.
---
It's always had higher dps then whisper, whisper just had the advantage of infinite ammo. After the nerf, DARCI will be pretty much strictly better.
---
This map though - you're either on the tidal wave or getting destoryed by one.
---
Only viable if you run Jotunn, Blast Furnace, and Hammerhead while camping power with OEM.
---
This super is what supers should feel like... super. I used this for the first time ever last night and got a lights out...
---
sry, m8, I'll butt on out of here.
---
Ive been playing Destiny since D1 was new and still havent done a raid because I have no friends in game
---
The "stolen" sparrow P.A.
---
its really just the release.  D2 vanilla was pretty bad, but I think D2 since forsaken has surpassed D1
---
Being one shot while in a super is absolutely ridiculous....
---
He wasn‚Äôt. Multiple people shot him with the toaster at the same time.
---
Xur will give you a guaranteed exotic you don‚Äôt have per week. This accounts for all Forsaken exotics too
---
Two Jotunn shots took you out.
---
I run with a 10 resilience and survive most fusion shots with a very short distance between.
---
You are correct. I didn't see that the first time I watched it!
---
I'm getting some weird readings, right here. I don't know what they mean.
---
Wish I could see the enemies i'm trying to shoot at...
---
The solution to an overpowered weapon is not to suggest a loadout it‚Äôs to have the meta tuned to have it balanced.
---
And this is why I hate playing hunter.... my super only last like 5 secs. Lol
---
I feel that Quickplay would stay as is. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Competitive though, would ban the supers and exotic gear sets. 
---
I've been saying that Crucible should only allow for crucible obtained gear sets to be allowed.  This way, you could effectively balance PvE and PvP activities easily, because you only have to balance the gear itself, since PvP gear sets wouldn't be allowed in the PvP world.
---
The supers aren't supers anymore...
---
Yep, high level comp is a joke rn. No one seems to care either since it‚Äôs a fusion rifle, if it were a shotgun wreaking havok this entire community would be in disarrayüòÇ
---
OC u/destiny_thememe
---
Lmfao justice served, idk about you but I think that would warrant a nice bagging
---
Thanks
---
Uhh well I did all of it in 2 days. Was a lot of grinding but I had the time to do so. If you don‚Äôt work at your own pace.
---
I get it. I find that if I don't read the Bungie forums ( Super Toxic ) I can just go play and enjoy myself with my friends. Sorry about the terrible attempt at a joke.
---
I just did it by starting up broodhold and killing jive in jetsam by using 2 masterworked weapons and shooting my super whenever it was ready. Then leave once i got paired up with the others and repeat. Now that i come to think of it, that was pretty stupid. I guess EP is a better way to progress.
---
Dusted
---
I'm just over here wondering why they nerfed Ursa again...
---
if you were crouching to hide your blip from the radar you probably wouldn't have died there
---
I'd absolutely love a raid encounter that has 2 or 3 bosses each with their own mechanic to initiate DPS phase. And then whilst you're doing dps other players must aggro the other bosses so you don't get battered whilst doing damage.
---
Storm trance is a constant attacking auto-lockon super. You got outplayed don't whine on reddit about it.
---
This subreddit is just ground dog day. All the posts are basically the samd but slightly tweaked
---
I do too, got better internet as well. I ended up just plugging in an ethernet rather than play off wifi. No errors since.
---
I'm just wondering if its worth using a Titan anymore.... Recently started a new character as a warlock and good lord they are so much more powerful than us. I may be switching to the dark side.....
---
Though it's not funny to make jokes about Parkinson or seizures, it does feel like having a seizure everytime i use it. I don't even bother to aim down sights anymore, makes it even more frustrating.
---
We've started to calling it a map now?
---
Does anyone know what time the TWAB usually drops?
---
It's a PvP weapon but I rarely use it in PvP... It's now fixed in my energy slot unless there isn't an add heavy encounter
---
I play like MAYBE 2 hours a day and have a ac unit in the room so it's not central heating and cooling...you just turn it on when using it then turn it off when you're done.
---
Gonna drop at 4:59:59 today as they run for the exit.
---
You know that they have to talk about something substantial this time around or it‚Äôs just gonna be gasoline
---
&gt;buffed sidearm damage by 0.01%
---
I think it‚Äôs because sudden death is literally mayhem mechanics, and we all know how shards is in mayhem..
---
Oh that makes sense
---
I‚Äôll try that. Still need 200 orbs, 10 precision kills and 3% strike completions.
---
Until they nerf it next week lol 20% damage reduction in PvE
---
That was my reaction lol
---
