It's ridiculous how they are just not needing OEM at all. This mask is still op it should just give you an overshield
---
---
---
This was a riven run. A last wish run would be all encounters. Everybody can cluster bomb riven and run the heart in one quick go...
---
Would have been more savage if he said something like "Hey, tell Mara that Shaxx says hi"
---
Jaw drops

---
I guess you could label it ‚Äúembarrassing‚Äù but not really. This mans earned his title and wants to show other peeps, let him flex! Don‚Äôt see the point on your negative comment tbh.
---
Good call
---
That doesn't help. They seemed to have been glitching to stay in that area and not bombardment you
---
Then don't imply it
---
So if I've been chasing Rivensbane or Cursebreaker for 6 months and been denied due to RNG, I should just be quiet and happy I can get Blacksmith with less RNG?    
---
Doesn't the way Blacksmith is set up just show more clearly how poorly thought out the other titles are?
---
Why is out so outrageous to want or ask for changes to the other titles to bring them more into line with Blacksmith after 6 MONTHS?

This listing was created today, almost certainly in response to this post. There are lots of people who trawl reddit for popular posts of graphics and funny shirts. They upload low resolution images found on google or even cut and pasted from the reddit post‚Äôs photo, onto garment preview images. 
---
The broken English nonsense description is also a red flag (even though it‚Äôs inadvertantly hilarious). When you buy the shirt, if you actually receive it you will very likely receive a shit quality shirt with a fuzzy blurry print.Be careful, friends!  
---
That's a damn pretty shader.
---
That's sick where u have it made and what they charge you
---
Rock those High-cal rounds lad, flinch for days in crucible.
---
Just needs the shader! Congrats on the roll.

I'd tell him he should maybe try flushing his DNS or cycle his connection. 
---
That was a good fight congrats 
---
Read the post again. You read it wrong my dude.
---
You can smell the Titan sweat with all the downvotes on the OEM hater posts.
---
I want to be able to zoom out when trying on any piece of gear tbh
---
I got it made from this site: [https://www.contrado.com/custom-hoodie](https://www.contrado.com/custom-hoodie). It cost me $100 USD
---
Weapon is the best now just try to get a rampage mod
---
Drop Mag _reeeeeeee_
---
No animation? :(

r/absoluteunit 
---
Could you imagine a ghost shell with bling and a single tear drop tat?
---
Wait? Is shattered throne open RN?
---
That‚Äôs the first thing you should have done when you got last word lmao! What were you using before?
---
I don't know if I understand your second point, but I 100% get your first point. The ONLY things I have done in Destiny in the last 2 months now is get my Luna's, help a friend work on theirs, and do nightfalls to help a 3rd friend get his Gwisin vest lol.
---
Oof! That's something I would do. Gotta love grenades although at least your not a warlock with a grenade that can one shot 600 enimies simultaneously. 
---
Surprised to see this is not deep fried.
---
I loved it too man. Vault of Glass was dooope. I do honestly believe that D1 should have launched with all the content from Vanilla up to HoW. I quit after HoW because I felt like I got ripped off lol. Only came back to Destiny with the Forsaken update.
---
You‚Äôre a fool to not care about it. The new update coming up is fixing numerous things people have been complaining about. THEY DO LISTEN and they keep updating the game. The new updates actually seem pretty amazing. Why the fuck do you care about what people post on here so much? 
---
Maybe, try not getting on Reddit for more than 8 hours a day, maybe reddit won‚Äôt ‚Äúpiss‚Äù you off so much.
---
Thank god!
---
You get to a certain point in the quest that you need to beat the raid to get an underpowered version of acrius. There's a strike to beat, and something else i think. After that, you have to play the raid again (prestige or normal) to earn emperor tokens from beating encounters/bosses. You need ten tokens to upgrade it. THEN....if you beat prestige mode you get the ornament 
---
Hey! Titan veteran here...fuck you üòò 
---
I‚Äôm telling ya, I‚Äôm poor
---
I got mine thru lots of blind well, especially teir 3 or higher 
---
I‚Äôve gotten about 3-4 this exotic engrams since I‚Äôve had the game (got it like two weeks ago tho) 
---
But yea either you‚Äôre insanely lucky or I just have my regular RNG luck (utter shit)
---
I haven't been in there since post forsaken, so let me rephrase, whatever their default position is, they will all reset to their default position if you fail. You don't need a chime to know you failed.
---
There will also be a chime when you're successful, after pulling the 6th lever.
---
Cause it is. 
---
How is that an argument you are just making a statement to be an asshole
---
apparently it's a newly discovered technology that is revolutionary. Renders everything in game, in real time. If you just search youtube for NVIDIA RTX E3 2018, there's probably a VOD somewhere.
---
Would you mind if I used this as a thumbnail for a YouTube video? (Whenever I get Jot√ºnn that is) I‚Äôll link the post in the description and give credit of course
---
The guns feeling more similar to real guns isn't subjective though. The enemies benign varied isn't subjective though. The maps being comparable size isn't subjective though. Anthem having no endgame content at all isn't subjective though.
---
Does the lore still think there are stronger guardians than our character? Or have they admitted we are literally unstoppable
---
I think there might be lore, but I can't remember. 
---
thank you jorge, very cool
---
This drawing is amazing! DRAW FOREVER GAURDIAN!
---
boo hoo the exotic people use against me isnt going to be completely useless after the nerf /s
---
Gonna be honest, I didn‚Äôt even notice it happen 2x during my second infamy reset, and then I got a third without realizing one my way through my third
---
"oh its a 6v3? better pick up power ammo"
---
It's not that bad. 40 matches is easy compared to other quests for great weapons.
---
Oh dear. What should Shaxx say...
---
Shin 100%. He can summon a handcannon with the power of the sun. Also, you know, immortal.
---
Good job. Take my updoot
---
What did he say?
---
True, but what if it was during the Red War and it came down to pure skill on the draw?
---
Yeah bank more mote!
---
You're not alone. I played the betas. I've watched the streams and YT vids...and still I see nothing that compells me to add it to my library. Maybe in 9 months when it's found an identity for itself...but for right now it's a definite pass.
---
Couch is this you? Was playing with Slaya tonight
---
LOL that doesnt excuse all the day 1 bugs. Just cause someone else did it doeant mean it's ok 
---
No we were more likely boarding the colony ships to yeet out Earth.
---
wait what
---
Finally? Couldn't you see the whole thing in vanilla? I'm pretty sure because I was pissed when they changed it. I remember looking at the IB wolf cloak and being able to preview the entire thing. 
---
Mate we can see the watermark right there in the middle of the image.
---
might want to get an eye test there mate, cammy slid around the corner and scoped in
---
Its aim assist at long ranges that is being reduced.  Simply catching the corner of the hit box without your cursor ever being over the actual player from across the entire map wont score you a hit anymore QQ. 
---
Don't infer that damage is being nerfed or the range where falloff damage begins to occur..
---
My take on the shotguns was generally positive. Only question unanswered was how many rounds per green brick and how many rounds can you carry. Its a huge win for all other shotguns, and a minor buff to full auto via damage per round even if you fire less rounds per minute. 
---
They just completemy made it not a night and day difference in damage to use other than a full auto shotgun. They just removed the expectation that you must grind EP to get ikelos before you are "Allowed" to join an LFG raid. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Gosh the knee jerk uninformed unable to read for understanding before salting the interwebs with "facts" "Completemy worth your time to read opinions"
---
I prefer a pulse too, but breakneck at 3x rampage is the highest dps kinetic in the game. Some strikes/nightfalls it's my go-to, the waves of scorn in the baron strike for example.
---
How did you get the Warlock net to your name?
---
And yeah, warp/telesto combo is a lot of fun. 
---
Thats dope as hell congrats
---
I  really overlooked this first time thru...  LOL!!!
---
yeah, as long as nobody steals your last hits &gt;_&lt;
---
Novideo cards omegalul

How big is the seal?
---
It's nacho time yet br√ºtha
---
The white prestige ornament comes from completing the full quest. This ornament comes from eververse.
---
Console or PC, what region are you in and times do you play? If on PS4 and your play times match mine I'll join you.
---
Small spoiler below. 
---
Love that cutscene though. Regardless of all these new games being launched etc. I'm looking forward to seeing where the Uldren storyline goes. 
---
It doesn't increase the mag as it already has tactical. Otherwise I'd agree ;)
---
I started my lunas quest last night, and I'm already on 25/100 precision hand cannon kills. 
---
It's just the solo queing that's screwing my glory.
---
Yes, it makes the weapon more viable outside a well. I often run it with ikelos or threat level, meaning one shotgun reserve perk increase capacity for both.
---
which clan is that I was wondering when it will be on sale again since last week and here it is on sale.
---
I dont mind join a relaxed clan that doesn't care if you group up.
---
That's good advice. In this case the fight took a minute at most as I instantly killed the knights and took out the psions with a dragonfly hc. But I did notice in previous attempts that the psions are the major issue for me in this fight.
---
Thank you ;)
---
Surprised the tweet isnt 15 pages long explaining the meme.
---
Dont worry he will have ti back in two weeks or so.If you are missing only a few exotics, Fated Engrams will give it you eventually.
---
If you have the companion app, you don't have to wait for the email. I got my code for the Ace of Spades through the app and ultimately never received my email if I remember correctly. 
---
Holy mackerel! I did NOT think of that!
---
One of us is in California, and i'm in Arizona.
---
We play on PS4. We play anytime after 4:30 PM during the week days and around 10AM on weekends.
---
And it is bought. on sale again, thanks to a terrible Anthem launch I guess.
---
I have Snapshot and Moving Target and I still suck with it.To be fair though, I had a wrong understanding of what Moving Target actually helped you with.I thought it helped you acquire aim on a moving target
---
basically we're weak ass shits who just refuse to stay dead and everyone who stands against us gets killed with one of the many many uber weapons we stockpile and refuse to share. sounds about right
---
*Wooo* It's your **1st Cakeday** jonvuke! ^(hug)
---
 The only nuclear toaster with a handle that doesent blow up in your hands!
---
&gt;Especially in PvP, where people don‚Äôt have aim like drunk stormtroopers.
---
You clearly havent run into me, I see
---
You sure you don't mean ornament? They can drop from bright engrams before you have the weapon. If you have D.A.R.C.I 300 precision kills will land you the catalyst. Good luck
---
Bold of you to assume we won't find another way to meet ourselves at insane speeds
---
Can't you just repeat the First Wish a few times, get a couple Ethereal Keys, then go open a few boxes. The wish doesn't seem that bad to put in over and over considering like half of the symbols are fish
---
Good job...I guess? Dont know much about it or Destiny tbh but I do know that gun is fucking hideous. Its just...*shudder*
---
That's an exotic
---
[removed]
---
I literally clapped my hands and shouted FINALLY when I saw this on the update notes 
---
I think that might have been it. Could have sworn I'd had one in D2,but I'm probablly just getting my weapons mixed up ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Thank you, I‚Äôll speak to him later about it. Do you know where he needs to shoot? He‚Äôs also using hammerhead as the void weapon and we‚Äôre also not sure whether this will work as it‚Äôs one of the forge weapons?
---
Tower and not ending red war go together.
---
You mean farm righ?
---
i tried soloing it a few months ago on my freshly 620 ~ish titan and almost got it but ran out of heavy and super. Now all my chars are 650 ill probably do it again (got the meatball last night on my warlock)
---
Damn so just the rank resets the other steps like the multi kills one I‚Äôm up to know if I finish that it stays ?
---
Three things:
---
First things first: You are not a bad artist. You are learning to get better everyday and should never stop that. There are always people that are better than you and you need to learn to get inspired by them not be intimidated. Look at FZD-school on YouTube for a master giving lessons.
---
Secondly: draw on nice paper. That way you can be more proud of the finished product. And paper does not cost a lot.
---
And thirdly: don't shy away from certain aspects because you think you are bad at them. Don't think I don't recognize that hand placement ;) 
---
Hands and feet are very difficult at the beginning but you can only get better when you draw them. One weird claw-abomination at a time.
---
Keep on drawing it really looks good.
---
And be proud of your work!
---
TLDR: your not bad you are a learner, big difference. Be proud, draw on nice paper. Don't hide your weaknesses work on them and master them.
---
If you have any questions shoot me a p.m I'm more than happy to guide you in the right direction :)
---
Lol I got like 5 üòÇ
---
Can resilience go above 10? Honest question for build purposes.
---
I can complete the raid in all blue gear. People saying these sets are no good because they don't have the perks are either shit at the game or are just over estimating what the perks can actually do. 
---
Sans is that you?
---
F
---
He‚Äôs right. It is amazing
---
If he has something you want you have to complete the raid or raid lair that piece drops from. The catch is you have to do it that week. 
---
For example if you see he is selling midnight coup you need to run normal leviathan that week to buy it. 
---
If you are on oc use the destiny 2 pc lfg discord server. It still sees a decent amount of activity for legacy raids at peak times. 
---
If it cost everything for Luna's Howl, I hate to see what Not Forgotten would cost.
---
The helmet stays on
---
cool
---
Really feel like the nova warp nerf was kinda pointless. I never see enough nova warps for some reason. Bungie should have nerfed spectral or OEM first.
---
Hell yeah, we all glad to hear that you did the original triumph, but it‚Äôs not based on your skill so much, you‚Äôre just lucky that some people in the opposing team used their fukken super in gambit lol. So I don‚Äôt get why you are so upset about the upcoming changes. 
---
I can't help it all them bloody young ones and their lingo getting to me haha
---
Hell yeah, One and Done. Just wait till i try get a thousand voices haha
---
I had to collect 12 keys and open all the chests in one run. It dropped on the 10th!! That how low my chances where, on the 5th chest i got ursa furiosa though. I recommend doing that to maximize ypur chances, also is a great way to farm exotics.
---
And that is what is causing the downfall of society, social media gives people the voice they would never use in public
---
Well i mean, lets look at the reason they'd be afraid to bring it up in public. Is it because they're wrong about whatever the issue is? maybe, maybe not. Or is it because online they can bully people in a relatively risk free way and maybe feel that little bit of power they probably don't get from their day to day life.
---
You're welcome! For some reason I haven't got the Hazard of the Coast yet, even through aquiring Breakneck. Seems like you've got the same problem, but with Parcel of Stardust, right?
---
I generally do, there's an entire room in my Discord server dedicated to stuff like this.
---
now we need to do something about that awful dawning cloak that gives a horrible helmet.
---
seriously because of that i lost cores to infuse it only to realize it has a horrible helmet included
---
that's never a reason to not do anything
---
when was the last time (your) right to proclaim (your) heterosexuality needed to be defended and when were (you) a victim in any measure because of that?
---
 but players have to abide by the rules while playing.
---
Good on you mate. I'm about to go on in 10 and figure out if shattered throne is up. 
---
I think it's just RNG. I feel like I get a lot of exotic drops, but the person I play with all the time barely gets any and he is newer than I am. Doesn't seem to matter which character I'm on and he only plays one. 
---
Have you ever heard the phrase "don't feed the trolls". Everyone gets hate mail, its usually dumb childish insults. If nobody responded to them theyd stop, theyre just looking for attention.
---
Whats more childish though is trying to shut someone up just because they dont agree w you or they were mean to you. I'm sorry but the world does not revolve around you, and bungie is not mommy. Debate them or ignore them and move the hell on.
---
I, personally, have never seen someone say you can't beat anything in the game without armor perks. The point is, why make it harder? Unless you are going for some personal achievement there is little incentive to wear Y1 armor.
---
I probably sound like an idiot, but what is this whole last word/snipe thing I keep seeing?
---
Thats an RNG blessing my friend!
---
True. No variety at all
---
why would you make a one eyed mask Sans
---
Yea, i mean.. why make all but two shotguns finally useful in PvE?
---
That makes like zero sense.
---
Every gun can be used and everyone is able to use them...
---
The scout doesn't come from rank up packages if you haven't already earned it. It comes from giving ana the braytech schematic you can get from sleeper nodes.
---
What‚Äôs your strategy for Mountaintop?
---
It's not reall going to continue. Becoming a guardian would have erased his memories and motivations...
---
*BUTS ITS RANDOM*
---
Wait a minute, are our guardians Russian.
---
Is that your maths book lol
---
I just need to prestige my infamy 3 times and I have Dredgen, so it seems I have some grinding to do.
---
Level 50, upgrade point available
---
truly why i enjoy ending xor
---
This has been my life for the last twelve hours lol
---
It depends on how many other players there are man
---
Wizard? Witch idk? We kill the two wizards, stand on the platform and destroy the corresponding crystal next to the portal. But i killed the big witch/wizard that spawns at after killing the two wizards and the event ended so i just presumed that it was my fault. 
---
What shader is the warlock in red using? Looks sick
---
What shader on your Nameless Midnight?
---
[r/suddenlycommunism](https://youtu.be/U06jlgpMtQs)
---
Look at it from this perspective, taken goblins can make other blockers immune there fore causing the enemy to take a bit more time to remove them. It could just give you the time you need to invade and wipe all their motes 
---
Daughters looking at crota like a dumbass. 
---
Games not over till the screen goes dark my man.
---
Starts automatically just look in your quests if there's a red coupon like thing that asks you to do PvP stuff. 
---
Pink rabbit transmat effect? Holy shit you're soooooo lucky!
---
Brutes, elementalists, furies, titans, scouts, turrets, rocket turrets, enforcers, hunters, skorpion workers, skorpion drones, skorpion warriors, shotgunners, etc      
---
    
---
Its subjective because you're being intentionally ignorant to prove the point to yourself.   
---
   
---
I'm done trying to appeal to you, you're just a fanboy who is going to think what he wants regardless of reality.
---
It's a serious issue.
---
I don't think I have ever gotten a good FCF roll and it bothers me cause I love the Dragunov look. 
---
It's always like, triple tap, firmly planted. 
---
Or genesis, grave robber.
---
Seriously, Bungie? 
---
Can I please have rangefinder, snapshot or something?
---
To be clear, you have to buy these pins. Just like the special weapons they are for sale in the bungie store and once you've unlocked in game you get a discount code to make it a more reasonable price.
---
The promotion ended last year, you can't get them anymore.
---
I dunno about you guys but when it's my guardian the only thing going through dregs minds is usually a bullet.
---
I always yell "get that logo outta my face" because Shaxx puts up the game ending graphics during those last crucial seconds covering up 45% of my screen, while some sweaty is running straight at me
---
Best FCF I've gotten so far has snapshot and outlaw.  But agreed, it's my go to energy sniper.
---
Also theres no rape occurring in these panels so its probably not Goblin Slayer
---
Yea, hopefully they change comp to where it doesn‚Äôt de rank u, like once u reach a certain rank u can‚Äôt go back down, that would be amazing 
---
Did you sign up for the rewards?
---
Luna is out of stock you can only get last word now. 
---
No. D2 was a great game that had unrealistic expectations placed upon it.
---
Quick question, do I have to be forging a gun for those to drop ? Or could I just run forges and it would drop ? 
---
If it's a 5% chance, there's actually a \~4.60% that you don't get one across 60 runs. :/
---
You have to be forging a powerful frame for both Jotunn and Le Monarque 
---
I've only ever seen a bunch of cool panels of GS tearing goblins to shreds, but everyone always brings up rape, is it really that prevalent in the series?  
---
Theres a key on top of the portal the mindbender comes out and steps to it behind it if its the one i think it is. Type in ‚ÄòHiving in Plain Sight Triumph‚Äô on Youtube and youll find it
---
These are great. Keep up the good work guardian. 
---
It‚Äôs the last wish raid shader. It‚Äôs the color scheme of the armor without shaders on.
---
I stand corrected.
---
&gt;At the very least it opens up the option to use other exotics without feeling like you're purposely handicapping yourself.
---
This is how I feel about Insurmountable Skullfort.
---
Granted, I'm a strictly Rumble kinda guy, but Skullfort and Striker turn me into All Might and OEM/DRB turns me into the bottom-scoring placeholder guarantee. 
---
What emblem?
---
I'm referring to powerful gear.  Sounds like you're just talking about rare gear. Also there's a soft cap at 580 so you will only get better stuff from prime engrams and powerful gear
---
That does not count for this quest any more. 
---
Got dredgen, no discount code ever sent. I is cry forever
---
I like that name, I'm going with that too!
---
Dam 
---
word!
---
Got rivensbane and wayfarer, just need the ghost for dredgen (doing it next week during x3 infamy) and the ghost for cursebreaker (got the ship last night). Lets pray i get that RNG ghost drop
---
Use it for bosses when ur Whisper doesn't have Catalyst. It does the best dps, and it is great for spamming shots when Personal Assistant is active. I fully grinded out the Catalyst for D.A.R.C.I because I love it that much.
---
You and me both, my friend.
---
And here I am with none compete 
---
Some rando did it in a match. I cried.
---
Fake.. Jotunn isn't real. I have to tell myself this to cope with terrible rng ;_;
---
/s
---
Is he also r/EliteDangerous?
---
that‚Äôs assuming you get the curated ones, kinda hard to come by. and i haven‚Äôt done SOTP quite yet, still tryna get 1k
---
Theyre available until march 31st (lora and crucible arr august 31st)
---
*When you leave a titan alone in Detroit* __CABAL IM COMING FOR YOU__
---
That is so FUCKING COOL! How do you get one?
---
Gold? It looked like gold.
---
Bread achieved!
---
*Wooo* It's your **1st Cakeday** lnsomn1ac! ^(hug)
---
Look at my recent for another yeet
---
Bring a fork
---
Are the missing exotics year 1? He only provides year 1 exotics
---
I had those two and outlaw rampage on my xbox now switched to PC and the grind starts again 
---
wheres the meme about everyone not playing titan whining and complain about something they don't play until it gets nerfed... 
---
I feel sorry for titans tbh because this is what the majority of the community did..(about titan skating) was just whine, bitch, and complain until they had it the way they wanted it because they werent good enough to deal with and were getting shit on by it and couldn't even do it themselves... 
---
and little do people realize now titans bottom of the meta again and even with no nerfs its still a million times easier and more crutch to play and abuse what a hunter and warlock could do ( trust me because is do).. of course most people disagree because they play them.. if you played at any form of upper level and aren't completely salty and bias about getting skated on you would realize the skate nerf wasnt needed and  without it there is no reason to run titan compared to other kits on a competitive level... if you don't understand that well youre just too bad not to realize or your still mega salty about titans..
---
I play all 3 classes btw not bias toward any before someone starts trying unjustify or insult and say some sort of a cop out reason why I might be saying this
---
if this upsets you and that's what you feel you need to do then chances are your exactly the na√Øve complaining person im giving examples about.
---
.. but its unreal how many people are too ignorant or just simply not good enough to understand that they don't know shit about balance in this game, and would rather just bitch, and complain to nerf something because its not what they like or do... and they are mega triggered when it gets done to them and they aren't good enough to deal with or understand why... and its these low tier salty perspectives that voices themselves and warps the meta of the game to scrubs.. this game is balanced around scrubs... harsh reality
---
im proud ill never complain or call for balance changes based around my own bias reasoning, or low tiered skill level and impose this childish "but I don't like it" type of reasoning to the point where I turn into a whiney bitch and try to impose is so much, until I get something nerfed
---
sad really
---
I never had a problem dealing with it or executing it..  but people just complain till nerf because they cant handle getting dunked on by it #gitgud
---
lmao dude, congrats, keep it up!
---
Ok Fr tho the nova warp nerfs got me fucked up lmfao
---
Hmm, without doing SotP it's harder yeah. I find curated raid weapons to be much more common than curated forge weapons.
---
What are you missing.  There are restrictions to how the engram works.
---
1) It will not as of now give Y2 stuff, only Y1 - Warmind.  
---
2) It will not give a quest based item that is missing regardless if it is Year one, some examples (Whisper of the Worm, Polaris Lance, Sleeper)
---
3) It for armor will ONLY give items for the class you are when you buy the item and it will drop based on light for that class.  So if you have a Hunter and Warlock and have ALL the Y1's for the Hunter Xur can drop but need Warlock items, and buy with the hunter, you will get a dupe as the hunter wont aquire Warlock items.
---
Tips on what guns work  best for adds ans i keep getting destroyed at the ogre  gg btw
---
Same! I got trinity ghoul, izanagis burden, and finished the malfeasance questline all in three hours! It was about time. Hadn‚Äôt gotten any good luck in about a month
---
What does neutral game mean? 
---
Jelly
---
Remember that Y1S3 or S4 vanguard item called "Spoiler alert" and the flavor text was "Someone's going to die?"
---
depends on what green you want.  there is a veist poison you get for banshee that has a military green and light green on it.  i use it on my titan for a doomguy esque appearance
---
As a Titan with OEM I believe OEM should have been nerfed. High reward for little-to-no work.
---
I know the feeling. Pole dancer hunter main and I was happy when I heard blade barrage was getting ‚Äúnerfed‚Äù I just wish they hit it harder
---
Macros = Cheating. End of story
---
Only the burn damage counts for Perfect Fifth kill. If the enemy dies when you score a critical hit it won't count for that Perfect Fifth kills even if the ability is activated. So you can try to body shot some enemies and also body shot on the fifth shot.
---
Lost sectors can give you uninterupted private time where you won't be bothered by other guardians. Try some lost sectors that are close to the landing zone (LZ) so you can quickly return to the LZ and start the lost sector again.
---
This is not how it works, it doesn‚Äôt matter if you worked hard or not, what‚Äôs broken is broken. 
---
So what perk do you recomend?
---
Thanks for the walkthrough! 
---
It would never have occurred to me to jump into Leviathan, but I guess it makes sense as most open world enemies are too squishy. Most seem to die from the bullet damage rather than the explosion/burn.
---
Hunter!
---
Same! Lol
---
First time crytans receive an important nerf in 3 years
---
I bought the game in August on the recommendation from friends, the deal was $70 for base game, Warmind, CoO, and Forsaken. Love every bit of it and now it's the only game that I play. Bought the Annual Pass for $35 just before BA dropped. Never spent a dime on silver and don't plan to at any point. Will probably buy any future content releases. 
---
$100 for at least a years worth of entertainment seems like quite a deal to me. 
---
That's just my experience, I know others have paid more.
---
The envoy's shields are always void type, Telesto is a great weapon to take them out quickly.
---
Malfeasance is a good choice for blockers and envoys as it deals more damage to corrupted enemies and Invaders (I have a doubt on this one). Plus you benefits the damage bonus when you land 5 shots ! It is also an ok weapon to clear ads if you land precision shots.
---
Concerning supers :
---
My personal favorite is the Warlock, Nova bomb top tree, with the Ahamkara helmet (the one that allows super energy on kills with your nova bomb)
---
Use it on large cluster of enemies and you'll get it back in no time, AND it deals significant damage to the primeval (wait at least a x3/x4 slayer bonud)
---
*Wooo* It's your **7th Cakeday** ShinKalEl! ^(hug)
---
GAH, I really did not know this. I thought as long as the ability was active, and triggered, the kill would count. At least now I understand -why- I've been stuck at 4/50 kills!
---
Many thanks!

---
How is he stupid? Because he decided to color his hair? Talk about surface level judgement lol
---
Well light level counts and theres a couple guns that can do that
---
Start the mission "Haephaestus" Get to the final stage, load 4 headshots and run to the other side of the room. give them a minute to cluster, run back and then her a headshot and on the 5th, body shot to a group. the explosion will damage everything in close proximity, and thralls are low enough health that the burn should kill the group
---
They gave you a condom and a gun to blow a hole in it with.
---
Cool.
---
They are trying to make more guardins
---
Chase the group instead of the 1 dude who‚Äôs running a different direction. I can‚Äôt tell you have many times a bait roaming supers away from my team because they tunnel vision on the closest guy
---
Really xur? Rigs again? Gimme that nighthawk!
---
Nothing... You actually just stated the rules put into place by Bungie.   
---
Looks like he is a really heated angry titan... Gonna have to learn to play again because they're taking away his crutches. 
---
I'm not exactly sure how it's "throwing money" at something, that's like.. 30-40 bucks per year?
---
I mean, i never even remotely felt the need to buy silver in the first place and less than 5$ per month for all the newest content is hardly anything.
---
200$ in 2 1/2 years is also insanely low, when it comes to games and what people spend on average.
---
What are they doing to lower it? I hadn't seen this yet. 
---
Ah fuck I‚Äôm a blueberry. 
---
Wouldnt pheonix protocol be good for most of it
---
they hated him because he told the truth
---
Nah
---
&gt;Edit: I'm not 100% sure using the boost causes you to not get the campaign reward exotics. I have been told by different people that it marks them as found in collections, but by others that it does not. I was unable to test this myself.
---
I think it does, at least some. I played up until I got to choose my first exotic reward, and then used the boost. Afterwards I had another exotic or two in collections and was confused as hell. Either way though, you don't get much.
---
Cheers! It took a while, this means a lot.
---
I like it in gambit a lot. I just got it as well about a week or so ago. The best part is running invasions and killing the whole team. I thought it would take a long time but I managed it twice in one game! Enjoy your new trophy!
---
Contraverse was good with Nova warp, but since warp is kinda dead, contra is dead with it for the time being. I've tried contra on top tree void and its just meh, way better exotics to use
---
Dear Xur, 
---
If you don't put Lunafaction Boots in your inventory soon, I will kill you. 
---
Sincerely, 
---
A warlock who would really like to run well sometimes.
---
Sorry I should have typed goes off on his own adventure before going to the Tower. Either way, I'm looking forward to seeing what happens! 
---
Grav again fml
---
Ohhh alright I misunderstood!
---
... Says the totally unbiased source
---
I'm thinking we'll see him and Mara again before D3, but this is Bungie so we might never see them again, like the Stranger. 
---
Checked quick and couldn't find anything, maybe I am just mis-remembering.
---
then don't worry about it. just get the 450 kills and be done with it
---
Thank you!
---
Same. Got them both this season 
---
How did that happen? How did you crash into that post, guardian?
---
Pretty easy to win a 1v1 when you know exactly where they are so they can‚Äôt  really run away and reengage 
---
Dude I knooooow. 
---
MY BADLANDEEERRRRR
---
How much points so i can get not forgotten 
---
Congrats man. Feels good :)
---
What do you mean 
---
I‚Äôm assuming it would be, but when I ran WoR for Vorgeth I used Lunafactions. 
---
If you have Skull of Dire Ahamkara, use it with top tree Voidwalker. The whole first section can be easily done with this super. Also does quick work on the adds/knights with D√ªl. 
---
How much points to reach legend  ?
---
Ah. I don‚Äôt play Gambit, so I wouldn‚Äôt know that
---
5500 is legend rank 
---
all the hunters and warlocks when they complain about OEM
---
Fair enough
---
Doubt it. At least I hope not
---
Ty
---
Or just use hard light
---
 Nope! I had to google it before I could answer your question, lol. Most of my commissions are through, Twitter, Insta, or my Etsy Shop. 
---
yep
---
In specific scenarios and terrain. Which none of the pvp maps really have.
---
Kill Clip + Rampage isn't as hot as people make it out to be. Any hand cannon with Rampage has 1-shot kill potential on most adds, and the Kill Clip + Rampage 3 doesn't even come close to the ammount of damage that Special weapons deal. So basically if you need to kill a big enemy, you're better off switching weapons instead of trying to get your stacks up, and any other Rampage HC will have the same add-clearing potential.
---
Melt it.
---
Thx my dude
---
Keen eye! 
---
Dope. Also, what are those shaders and what is that cape? Cause your hunter looks fly.
---
Fair enough. 
---
I have done 7 Scourges without a single Threat Level drop.
---
can't really have a wank without at least 3 rapes tho
---
I'm looking for a clan that has strong PvP, and people to play casual PvE with.  I have all DLC except the annual pass, I am around 580 Light, and I am at 2200 glory, and I am sick and tired of playing solo que with 3 scrubbs w/out mics against a 4 man nf 5000 glory team.  If you can help me, please message me!
---
Bergusian Night (or Knight, I forget)
---
Current IB set with stompees + ornament
---
Might be preference but i don't like using special ammo to pop shield. 
---
I am a die hard auto fan so there's that 
---
No you just need $777,777.777
---
I don‚Äôt get it with surrounded. Much rather have QuickDraw makes that gun a beast 
---
It‚Äôs been several months and I‚Äôm gambit free since I got break neck then last curse week I got dredgen title I‚Äôm wiped after that.
---
Yes it‚Äôs crimson valor... my bad took forever to reply 
---
Praying EP SG strat still works on shuro chi
---
Nope you guys are correct, someone else pointed it out on another sub. I was thinking of the Cathedral of Scars
---
Yes. I'm on PC. The clan has over 70 members but I see the same few on.
---
Are there bows in the game now?  
---
Doing better than I have, most of the time I get matched with blueberries and I can't progress.
---
I have m1 as X, m2 as O, m3 as Square and m4 as Triangle
---
I didnt think it needed explaining. If I can see you through walls, running will only do so much, and probably not get you away.
---
oh i agree. i've been discussing with others the idea that games should cost more up front but also take way more time in development. to be fair our prices for games haven't gone up in a long time, so where will it hurt the most? the quality that we get of course. 
---
1. I already googled
---
2. I recently downloaded a game of similar size is rest mode so I assumed it had to do with Destiny 2 more than my PS4 settings
---
The vow literally cannot even one shot a guardian not in their super.
---
I main a Titan and yes those two needed nerfing. But I can‚Äôt believe that Spectral Blades is not being touched.
---
It lasts too long. And the only real way of shutting it down is a one hit super. Even then, it‚Äôs jumping all over the place that you‚Äôd be lucky to hit it.
---
Either nerf it‚Äôs health or the time in super. One of the two. I‚Äôd go for health - it‚Äôs hard enough hitting the damn thing that you should get rewarded for it. Double shotgun and melee and I‚Äôm barely over half.
---
Or...
---
Put all other supers to the same level of health.
---
This thing is amazing for escalation protocols. Big group of enemies? Use my super and they're gone and I have my super back!
---
What gamemode are you going to use it for? 
---
So uhh, RNGesus? Can I has OEM now? (Legit the only exotic armor I'm missing..)
---
Raid, strike, and general PVE.
---
Probably cluster then, because linear fusions are only good in pvp unless you use sleeper or another powerful rigle against a boss but itherwuse cluster would be best, especially for large groups
---
It's the whole package included. But you can buy it separate which is over priced. 
---
Search ‚ÄòSolarion Destiny 2‚Äô in Google. Our site is the .net site. I just switched to PC myself and our clan is very active :)
---
You‚Äôll get a discord invite on signup.
---
That TINY BARREL shoots that HUGE ROCKET?!
---
In Season of the Drifter, we‚Äôre making a few changes to rapid-fire Shotguns, and the Full Auto perk. 
---
No one 
---
Is there any quick way to know if something is curated when it drops, or do you just have to look up what the curated perks are?
---
Just a video talking about trials. tellme what you think. leave a comment thanks :)
---
I was working on my account completion before I realized that was a waste of time do I incorporated destinations and that's near impossible because I dont spend enough time farming for exotics 
---
Didn't specify why he's stupid. I think all the media coverage and the last 10 years would explain why I called him stupid. This is just extremely minor icing on the cake. Stop assuming please

If that's true, I take it back then. I am a little bipolar from my mom's side of the family and I can understand how that might make you a little crazy. Only after going on medication that I actually managed to level out.
---
*first world problems*
---
Probably the dumbest one I've seen this year too
---
The hardest choices require the strongest wills
---
Breakneck, one of the most trying grinds I‚Äôve completed. Getting the EP shotgun to drop was worse because of you know, rng.
