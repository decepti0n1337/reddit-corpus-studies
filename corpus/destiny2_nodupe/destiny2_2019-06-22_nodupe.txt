I haven't even opened the program in a year or less so I really feel like it has nothing to do with it but its spelled out quite clear how I don't have an option to appeal and it's over. Thank you for your input anyways
---
Well Mr d1 vet, I'm pretty sure back in d1 if you didn't buy the expansions you couldn't play iron banner in the first place. Not only that but iron banner had level advantages back then too. At least they even allow players without the dlcs to play it in the first place. Honestly kinda hoping this is just a troll.
---
That's great information, thanks.
---
It‚Äôs the jazz hands guy dancing to ‚ÄúYou Can Fly‚Äù from Peter Pan
---
Honestly, I've gotten suspended from comp multiple times because the connection crashes and kicks me out lmao
---
Not quite.
---
I'm at 2260 hours in D2 alone.
---
You haven't pointed out anything. Especially when you say things like "Iron Banner is pay-to-win".
---
&gt;I mean the president of my company nearly makes my yearly salary every week but i don't see why its that big of a deal
---
It's a big deal because in order for him to make that much while sitting on his ass, you are being used and manipulated.
---
&gt;I know how much value i can give to a company so why should i waste time with a company that wouldn't pay me at least that
---
Because no companies actually pay you the value you give them. That would require no president/CEO at the top sucking money - just workers working and taking home what they produced. That would be syndicalism/socialism, and it's a vast improvement over the system we suffer through, today.

&gt;Why are people working for Musk if he is stealing from his employees?
---
Why are you working for that warehouse? Everyone needs a job
---
&gt;I don't see why anyone would stick around if working there is as terrible as you make it out to be.
---
Because life without a job is always even worse. People are desperate
---
I‚Äôll upvote calling ppl out on low intelligence any day of the week.
---
Musk of the quiet one
---
I would but you're a whiny bitch and you uninstalled the game.

Wow, your post is making me want to stop playing destiny 2
---
hahaha let me test that chin of yours irl
---
Whatever gets you kills.
---
No he means the one below it. /s
---
Dudes just trying to make you feel insignificant. Great accomplishment AND I see those titles! Congrats!
---
Wow you convinced me to stop playing Destiny 2
---
Who?
---
I do not understand how you had the sanity to complete this three times, i would‚Äôve had aneurism because of the state of PvP. Nevertheless though, shit looks fire
---
LFG ....stop queuing up with randoms.
---
The Destiny community will never let this stand because whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold
---
You feel that bad about yourself that you have to ruin people‚Äôs excitement and put others down? It‚Äôs a pretty good accomplishment considering the shitty grind we have to do for it and the state of pvp we have to deal with. Maybe settle down a little
---
Nope. I‚Äôm on my warlock right now and it‚Äôs not there.

I'm sorry?

No do I need to?

If you buy the deluxe version yes, if you buy just shadowkeep then no, so if you want to spend 35 bucks then you have to wait for september 17th, if you wanna play now you gotta pay the 60
---
Yes
---
It specifies fabled in glory m8
---
Honestly the better loadout would be any primary, loaded question for ads, and swarm of the Raven for boss. Right now swarm with spike grenades will out DPS any grenade launcher including wendigo.

Yeah, just scout and sword kills to go..

---
Lol, thanks for the callout. Yeah, Musk's initiatives are materially costly (more so than it appears) and are environmental liabilities. 
---
And then there is, of course, the moral issues you pointed out.

Defending Musk is like saying it would be okay if George Washington was a genocidal maniac, but was okay because he lead to America's independence.

I have the free to play version of D2 on pc (Battlenet). If I preorder shadowskeep on steam can I access all the season 1 dlcs on the battlenet version ?

More freedoms like I'm not stuck working 70 hour weeks at a factory like my dad while my mom worked as a bank teller just so I could feed my kids. 
---
I'm not angry at you, you're just focused on it too much. It doesnt matter, you personally will not affect change on a big scale and wont make a difference. Maybe focus more on yourself instead of the country as a whole and you wont be stuck renting an apartment in California for your entire life waiting for things to get better.

I'm literally trying to make you realize ALL WORKERS are getting exploited to the bone. We're being sucked dry. You're in the minority who just wants to go "meh, who cares, I'll go have a beer now".

That's the bigger picture. Even if you don't suffer in the future, with the way workers are exploited and abused, your family will.

Crimson is best used in pvp if you're good in shooters. My buddy just started replaying the game and really wanted AoS. He completely wrecked lobbies with it when he was on that step of the quest. In pve it's still really good with traits from both red death and bad juju from d1. Not ideal for shields or bosses but it will wreck trash mobs and with the catalyst it's an orb generating machine.
---
I do know that if you preorder shadow keep on PS4 or Xbox it does include osiris and warmind.  And only the deluxe preorder gives you 9-11
---
Probably?
---
I have had Destiny 2 for not even a month. I am at light 719. Do your weekly and Dailey for the powerful gear! 
---
I still haven't started working on masterwork for my gear.........Sure I get stomped sometimes in Iron Banner. But I still manage to get plenty of kills and still have fun. Started iron banner this week at below 690 light.
---
You are making it sound much worse then it is.
---
Hmm, I'm seeing guys at 600 crap all over 750 players.
---
Me üòÇüòÇ got it first try
---
Been playing for two days and I think iron banner is a pvp game? I‚Äôm at about 320 and am not really have big problems. I don‚Äôt understand how people can three shot me when maybe I get someone‚Äôs shields down but I assume there are many variables.
---
Maybe, but I don't have a cult following of incels hyping me up as a demi-god. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

What about for PS4? I‚Äôm curious lol

I've held on to my expired ramen coupon for this exact reason.

Its from an old Disney movie, where the kid in the picture has the power to produce food from his hands. 
---
Here he just discovered his powers and makes slices of bread (and mustard[?]) From his hands in the school bathroom.
---
h o w
---
Guys its not lag, guy clearly has 10 resilience build.
---
Wish i could see this for PS4, bet there's a lot of them because there also a lot of crybabies in the crucible when they get killed in a gamemode that revolves around killing each other
---
i got the iron banner triumph but cant get the other triumph because i cant get all of the armor pieces yet. i came back to destiny happy about the changes until i ran into this. im pretty confident that if i played 100 more iron banner matches i still wouldnt have the full set. i have a bunch of arms and legs that i end up dismantling.
---
Yes, the point was more focused on the exclusive loot and eventually ornaments and catalysts. Those were awesome and well worth grinding for. But now all we have is subteir loot and a bad game mechanic so that it's closer to d1 IB. 1 step forward, 10 steps back.
---
Congrats dude!
---
*intrinsic* you get to choose which of the four or so scopes you want to look through
---
Problem is, I have to get to max light. And considering how much of a drag this already is, that means it'll take forever.
---
Same boat as you. But I tried it and it's just better the menagerie is sick
---
Not if you do your weeklies and daily stuff for powerful gear
---
Me 2
---
Do your spider bounties.
---
My Mountaintop is also pretty good at shutting those assholes down
---
Shadowkeep is the new paid expansion, year 1 is whats free.
---
This... this does put a smile on my face.
---
Tf are you doing here then?
---
I always draw the SeaBear circle for extra safe team
---
Pretty sure xur don't got that brov. Spider got dat.
---
Hah! I still have yet to do the raid
---
In fact, I haven't done a raid since the day the first raid opened up in vanilla
---
He told me I'm one of the good ones.
---
Can confirm I got from xur
---
You're gonna put a fancy box in your fancy cup?
---
Atleast I'm sure I did anyways, I never do spider bounties
---
Just do spider bounties. I think I got it in about 3
---
Got it from him thanks to the weekly engram
---
F
---
Wait he actually has it? But it's not a random world drop
---
So stoked for xcloud! Gaming is about to get super portable
---
Explanation: Have been seeing  a lot of people in the comments on Bungie's response to when they will nerf lord of wolves stating that LoW is in fact not broken and doesn't need a nerf.
---
ikora annoys me more than zavala tbh, dunno if it's because i never played D1 but every encounter or occurrence with her in D2 reeks of bungie trying to hard to make me like her and i'm not drinking their kool aid.
---
50% increase to direct hit damage, 8-10% increase to total damage per grenade
---
It dropped for me on Mars after eye in the dark.
---
If their own console, I think they are right. I've played 60+ games of iron Banner this season and I've been killed by Lord of wolves exactly once. And any shotgun would have killed me  on that one.
---
I mean, whatever this is, I want one.
---
Wait did he actually say this?
---
Septimity Ghoul?
---
Not really, once you have found a setup and script that works, it is not that difficult. We run as two titans with the jet boots in the jumping puzzle, and titan smash supers to clear everything except the bosses.
---
I can confirm, Arbalest dropped for me in the wild
---
When you tag a titan in comp and forget about him after 7 seconds.
---
Been on console for IB, probably played over 200 games at this point. It isn‚Äôt very common, but frequently enough, you will get six stacks with at least one person using it.
---
We need PC/Xbox/PS4 flairs so we know if someone is talking PC or console balance.
---
So you don't get shadowkeep with the free version?
---
This looks when the Power Rangers combines weapons.
---
I‚Äôve got five paragon mods on my top tree nightstalker, with distribution on my Orpheus Riggs, I‚Äôm living in the revelry
---
Titans are mad thicc why am I just now realizing
---
;)
---
You‚Äôre correct, but that‚Äôs not the sword I speak of. I‚Äôm talking about the one that appears in the Season of Opulence collections badge.
---
If you think any random person can be a CEO of the company then clearly his words aren‚Äôt getting to you anyway. Management isn‚Äôt as easy as you think. 
---
But sure, keep blaming the system for your poor SEC status.
---
*whAt tHe fuCK iS tHis*
---
The cropping of the image made it look like he was named 'Snaxx' and I think that works even better.
---
General consensus is that they will be rewards from heroic menagerie which comes next week 
---
Don‚Äôt know if they are gonna be boss drops or from the chalice however
---
Haha jw cuz I was a D1 Xbox player turned PC
---
You know what you must do
---
I just finished that step last night. It took 6 hours of IB. I wasn‚Äôt very efficient. Didn‚Äôt use any mods, exotics, ect. Is this ‚Äúquest‚Äù going to be on all season? What I mean is is IB coming back again this season or are we supposed to finish all this in a week?
---
your lack of items scares me
---
Yeah I quit playing after warmind because that and curse of Osiris were trash imo. I just started playing again about 2 months ago.Not sure there's anything worth grinding for. Look at your pursuits tab and anything yellow is an exotic. You could start there I guess. Polaris Lance is a grind I remember..... worldline zero is another. There's the curse of Osiris weapons but they don't have random rolls like the new content. I really don't have much to suggest because that content was bland. Get the annual pass and you'll have so many options that you won't know where to start.
---
I keep deleting them all for xur üòÇüòÇ
---
I am in the same boat. I am loving Crimson, especially as Masterwork. Just wondering the next one to get. My luck I won‚Äôt get another catalyst anytime soon.
---
If on 1080p and you're willing to turn shadows down to medium/high, not that much. D2 is well optimised and unless you want 1440p or 100+hz an entry level rig should be fine. For reference, I had a 1060 6gb which could do 100fps average on a 2k resolution.
---
True even with warmind and CoO it‚Äôs a pretty boring game but thank you for the advice. What platform do you play on?
---
Xbox one, you?
---
Yea want to friend me? We could run raids or crucible
---
Depends on what you want to run. Destiny 2, with Medium - High graphic settings, runs perfectly fine on my ~$1200 (AUD) PC. You can definitely get a suitable PC build that is cheaper.
---
I love that we are baby killers lol
---
*on**
---
The point of this post?
---
I have only done one raid myself. I'm a solo grinder for the most part. I could give you a hand though I'm sure.
---
No clue
---
Thanks
---
No
---
Yea we could run EoW my username is ASN Curry30 but I can only play later, what time zone are you in?
---
Atlantic
---
I just chocked on my blunt ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
I‚Äôll play later at 2 or 3 that ok?
---
Also what your user/gamercard
---
Till the season's over.
---
So what exactly are trying to say here ? Lol enlighten me please...
---
It makes a pretty big difference afaik. Just remember, this is limited. You could wait and start farming again Sunday? Mine doesn't have field prep, but I'll settle for it.  Maybe I'll keep farming, not sure.
---
Yeah the class that account for half of all players and best neutral game sure has it rough
---
4.
---
weve always been see hive
---
I honestly have no clue. It was really just a statement trying to show off how much of a no life I am
---
3 eastern sounds good.... I'll message you after. Don't want to put my gamer tag all over Reddit lol
---
I acquired it yesterday on my least used one, whether it works though...as you say may only be last season
---
I can relate
---
You‚Äôre calling me an incel because you believe someone who has popularized electric cars and funded projects that have made great leaps in space exploration is less important than a guy who posts questions about video games on Reddit, just because he‚Äôs a an asshole. 10/10
---
Canny is goat
---
I just want Juju :,(
---
If solo, it's only useful in certain situations. I would go Attunement of Fission (void). The super is meh (arc super is too) but the neutral game is REALLY good.
---
There's an actual questline now not just bounties. If you didn't complete the quest , you don't have access to all of the armor.
---
It was nerfed into the ground, but buffed a few weeks ago. It's not the best, but it's not bad either.
---
Nahhh
---
Every single day
---
Ghalrans deception I mean gladiator on all the existing drugs
---
Haha this feeling is so real
---
"Ayayayaya" *Piller Men Theme plays*
---
The way he talks makes me want to go to sleep.
---
I'm loving that bad JuJu with its stylish Gjallahorn hair
---
Complete the quest if you want all of the armor to be in the loot pool.
---
It definitely is not great for PvP, but it is a decent anti ad roaming super.
---
This could also happen (very rarely) with masterworked weapons
---
Xurs egg?  That's new lol
---
I feel like things are over-dramatized on here. Might be different on other platforms, but on ps4 most teams of 4 or more I've played against haven't been very good, probably just friends wanting to play together. Also the querst is season-long, so just by playing you'll get it done over the next two iron banners, although I guess for people playing more than one character there is a bit of a crunch.
---
This just about sums up why I wont come back to this game untill they fix this.
---
Um wait what, are you sure you‚Äôre talking about CammyCakes?
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say OP. They don‚Äôt have great roaming supers like Titans, and they don‚Äôt have any damage buffing exotics besides Celestial Nighthawk which is not really a buff, it just gives you the ability to fire all 6 shots at once. I‚Äôd say there more of a middle ground for players to start off with and then switch to a different character. Hence why there so popular.
---
This is the power of my stand [VAULT OF GLASS], Time has been stopped for 10 SECONDS
---
Titan arc supers are broken that‚Äôs why. I don‚Äôt know about the dodge though, I don‚Äôt use it to avoid bullets, mainly reload.
---
I had eternal warrior drop the day opulence came out, legitimately had forgot it was actually in Destiny 2. An exotic that has at no point been good or used by anyone, and has received like no buffs or anything since it entered the game. 
---
Aeon safe is a better exotic than Eternal Warrior.
---

Yes psplus and Xbox live are necessary to play multiplayer

Do you play on pc? If so I'd be down to take you through some time.

ZA SPARROW!
---
the only and i mean ONLY time i use this shit stomper is if 2 or more people are consistently using it vs me. i can normally deal with the 1 dude who uses it but then a second comes... and a third... and the forth...
---
Hey, pro tip bro. Place a small piece of colored tape/ the sticky part of a post it on your screen where your reticle would be when you aim in. I noticed that, when you aim in, you take a second to get to head level and THEN shoot. Fast reactions are the name of the game so being able to ads closer to the enemy‚Äôs head is invaluable! I‚Äôve gotten used to aiming at head level so I don‚Äôt need the tape anymore but I used it when I was still a rookie
---
There is a post on this reddit for ‚Äò‚Äôplayers that are going back to the game‚Äô‚Äô
---
Go check it!
---
Dab, or t bag just to rub it in
---
I literally main warlock, but sure. I expected people not to agree
---
Dodge isnt that good at all though?
---
I main hunter so what? This is clearly a P2P problem here.
---
Dude forsaken by itself is usually 35 dollars
---
that‚Äôs a yikes for him
---
Don't infuse stupidly and if you have tons of Vanguard and Crucible token, turn in and dismantle.
---
No not really
---
My aim sucks so I think I‚Äôm the one dishing out satisfaction lol
---
I run in a room get a guy to 2 hp and get austringer‚Äôd in the face and chuckle about how hype they must‚Äôve been to kill me
---
&gt;The new Khepri's is better than the older one.
---
What? They gutted that exotic and turned it into a sub-par D2 exotic like Lucky Pants or Tricksleeves. I'm not anywhere close to being a Hunter main and it still pissed me off. That may as well be a new exotic.
---
Absolutely!
---
Also NM Represent!
---
Ybut then you start to go to place I down but start it anyways. Am I a joke to you?
---
lmao lord of wolves isnt even that bad on consoles tbh. I get killed by more chaperones and gunnoras axes then lord of wolves
---
That moment when you realize destiny has i-frames
---
Deadass. They even said since the deal ended they are now able to fully express their creative ideas.
---
1. Each raid has a different difficulty in regards to powerlevel with the most recent raid having the highest difficulty.
---
2. No a clan is not needed you can either go into a guided game or find an LFG post or make one yourself.
---
3. Each raid has their own mechanics, and I would recommend watching a video to at least get a basic understanding. It would be even better if you found someone to teach you.
---
4. I say in my own opinion each raid is worth doing because they offer a different experience but in terms of relevance: Last Wish, Scourge of the Past, and Crown of Sorrow are the only raids that will drop gear with a relevant power level.
---
5. I have never played WoW so I can‚Äôt provide an answer to this one.
---
Just managed to get it to update finally.  A gold colored pyramid looking item dropped from a forge saboteur so I swapped to Drang and it updated the quest.
---
Merciless Crutch is better tbh
---
Any pvp section tbh
---
Play Crucible this weekend and on your first full reset you will get 10
---
this puts us titan mains to shame
---
This is still one of my favorite weapons in the game. A must for Gambit and add clearing.
---
Well once it gets later into the season those players will be in the higher and will probably stay there and not reset.
---
Malfeasance would like a word with you.
---
Those bundles give you the game and the historic dlc for free. You are paying 40 bucks for Forsaken and the annual pass.
---
I've never had an issue running my 6700k @4.7 GHz, 16 GB of ram, and my r9 fury. I pretty consistently have 90+ fps and have it capped at 144 so it doesnt turn off my freesync
---
Lol prepare for downvotes and many comments bashing you. Nice troll. Funniest thing is cammy dont even care if you say he is bad. But i would like to say where are your stats?
---
THIS IS AMAZING!
---
ah gotta love it. Had a guy argue with me that saying Shoulder Charge is insane cos a guy got 14 straight kills with it means that I can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs toogood. All because I said I was trash at crucible and the guy was running Mountaintop, NF, and Truth, so he would‚Äôve whooped us anyways. Love it
---
I like overflow bc you don't have to kill a bunch of enemies to make it useful, just pick up special or heavy and it overflows to a absolutely crazy amount. My Gnawing Hunger goes from 48 to 97. i feel like i never have to reload.
---
He connected when the hunter dodged. That was just hitreg being stupid
---
I had it in my inventory but hadn‚Äôt used it or been successfull the one time I did I started doing better today so I dismantled it I refuse to use the thing, plus half the time I don‚Äôt even use energy weapons.
---
I really hope so, and I hope they are working on PvP itself
---
WHAT IS UP GUYS!? RICK CATPISS HERE!
---
If you put one down everyone shoots the circle and looks at you for the rest of the run I do one now unless someone else does them too
---
Yeah LoW is only broken because it can kill at 15+ meters with no skill (on PC)
---
Finally destiny is going to have the attention and love that he deserve!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Peregrine Greaves is a Penumbra/Season of Opulence exotic which cannot be obtained from the Fated engram.
---
Arbalest is a Jokers Wild/Season of the Drifter exotic which cannot be obtained from the Fated engram.
---
From the top comment:
---
" Xur's fated engram gives you a random drop exotic that you don't have yet. It cannot give quest items, armor for the classes you don't buy it on, and it cannot give exotics added after Forsaken. "
---
[this is all we can see in the shop, there is nothing else we can buy :(](https://imgur.com/7ksDKgV)
---
I tried this a few times and never had any luck :( Feels good to see it accepted! 
---
(Also seeing you get blasted by a sentinel after the first high five killed me lmao)
---
And he is an AC-130
---
Is SUROS good? I have seen it in a few clips today.
---
I get killed by chappy and recluse more than anything. I got one shot by chappy across the length of one of the bridges in the dreaming city map yesterday.
---
I had a dude the other day running a bow and Pillager in IB and he was on top of the leaderboard I sent him a message saying thanks for giving that gun a good name lol
---
I‚Äôm a bit out of the loop since I stopped after forsaken but I disagree, even before the patch it was kinda good. I mean shotguns spawned with 2 rounds normally in crucible but LOW got effectively 3 if you used it right at a reasonably solid one shot kill. Plus it being exotic doesn‚Äôt matter with the whole hand cannon meta, meaning it wasn‚Äôt to big a burden
---
What if I enjoy using those guns? They just so happen to be happen to be meta but I enjoy using them and I have experience with them. Using off-meta weapons takes time to get better and that learning curve can be off putting
---
In my opinion, it's worth getting just so it's in your collections and you can get a different exotic from the Fated Engram.
---
That said, I am a PvE player, and I have been killed a fair amount by it in PvP.

I legit have a friend with a microphone so flippin sensitive it registers the ac in the next room like he's in a friggin wind tunnel. only yesterday did we discover he could turn the gain down and still be audible without hearing the fan-like noise.  just remember that it's not always the really obvious loud sounds that harm our hearing, it can also be the ever-present drone of an AC unit, fridge, freeway, etc... give your ears a break from the headphones every so often, they deserve a break too!

Its still better than 6 v 6 pure lunas matches.....
---
God that shit was actual pancreatic¬†cancer
---
They‚Äôre not using it for the super; they‚Äôre using it for the no(va) U grenade.
---
I do one if I need it. I will never place one if someone is shooting the circle. If they know what the circle is for then they can place their own banners.
---
I normally just expect one in the beginning. I feel like there‚Äôs too many mods to drop enough ammo packs of all kind to actually run out but that‚Äôs just me. So I don‚Äôt rly care if none are places afterward
---
I feel like people have forgotten the Jotuun also exists. Fuck that shit.
---
No, it was a special weapon but in the primary slot. 
---
But we don‚Äôt have primary slots anymore so it makes it all weird.
---
You spelt nightmares wrong.
---
You need better friends.

Great work Guardian! However loot posts are prohibited to prevent our subreddit from being cluttered (we get way too many!) - please keep these submissions in the weekly pinned loot/achievement thread. Thanks!
---
If you've got a question concerning if a roll you've got is good or not, try /r/ShardItKeepIt !
---
Up until this post I thought the same and always wondered why I couldn‚Äôt place one myself
---
I gotta agree with em. Shoulder charge is cheapest kill in the game
---
A fan blowing into the mic has got to be the worst, followed by heavy breathing
---
Remember when there was a decent chance to get an exotic from heroics
---
Well for me I have 7k plus shards constantly and will never be able to use them as fast as I get them now. Bright dust I‚Äôm sitting on a good 35k. In the future eververse shop items will still cost bright dust but be repurchaseable for shards. And everything you already have is in your collections and all amours will be able to use transmog and be applied like a ornament over a piece of amour.
---
Yeah I got mine from a fated too
---
Can I get a specific post
---
Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on  Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus  Ta'aurc. From what I can gather, he commands the Siege Dancers from an  Imperial Land Tank just outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but  with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this  beast out, and break their grip on Freehold.
---
My main issue now seems to be that people start it immediately before I can even place the banner
---
If a game is free to play in the playstation store you do not need ps plus to play it. I am fairly certain that when the game moves to the free to play section you will not need ps plus to play it.
---
I don't think its too much. That step was then only one that took time.
---
The melees not bad either and you can use blink so win win, Attunement of fission is the best all around crucible subclass imo but the super should be just a little stronger
---
I thought about doing that, but I ran top tree Arc Titan with skullfort. So I had two grenades and then getting my shoulder charge regen some of my grenade.
---
I don't dislike you man. I don't dislike anyone here. Moderators stay clear of bias, rule enforcement can rub people up the wrong way but c'est la vie.
---
you don't need ps plus to play free to play games on the playstation store online. even if they have online multiplayer ps plus applies to game that you pay for not ones that are available
---
I believe that was from choosing the wrong character for the GoT throne.
---
That's the one! Lol
---
It‚Äôs only in Mayhem
---
I miss planetary tokens
---
Oh decent! I knew about the health regent but I didn‚Äôt know about the recoil, that‚Äôs great!
---
He just cheesed it
---
Theres a glitch where u can shoot certain guns like the prospector and each projectile counts as a finish
---
So I could only acquire 1 per cycle, instead of 1 per character then?
---
Oh god I can‚Äôt unsee that
---
Bottom tree arcstryder dodge does lessong registration.
---
The pain when u and 2 others are working on making it heroic just to see that one thing using their super to finish the boss
---
With a better Devils no less.
---
I know that's the beloved sniper, but what's the best role for pvp?
---
It reduces damage taken by 40%, has no effect on how super melee attacks are registered, to my knowledge.
---
Master worked armor doesnt affect PVP
---
That finisher. *Chef kiss*
---
Tis true updoot for optimism
---
RULE 14. YOU MUST TELL US WHAT WAS IN THE EXOTIC ENGRAM
---
I‚Äôve claimed both and the rewards are nowhere to be seen, I know we get tribute hall sometime in July
---
Every individual projectile counts as a person, so he was probably using wardcliff.
---
What's the other one for
---
Borealis
---
What is that thing? We don't have them where I live lol
---
Oh thank god, I thought this was a pc post and just didnt understand
---
There‚Äôs r/fireteams, which might help you find a clan.
---
Defeating combatants in gambit using calus themed armour and weapons. So I bet you there will be one for strikes or nightfalls maybe
---

---

---
Yup
---
I didn‚Äôt play d2 when it launched I‚Äôve only been playing for a few months and I love the game! Menagerie is wicked. I‚Äôm very excited for shadow keep I plan on pre order ASAP
---
Got the Trinity ghoul to drop as an engram for me in a random vanguard strike. Shit is satisfying
