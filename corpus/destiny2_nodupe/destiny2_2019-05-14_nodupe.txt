IDK what the Hawkmoon would have to do with the Nine and the First Curse with Factions
---
Maybe he was trying to take cover the enemies outside? I mean the boss just did shoot a giant beam of black death right before he went for the revive

In this case, go for which ever has the best range tbh

Better idea Make the locations downloadable into a cache so that they are all preloaded to improve loading times
---
Thank you and i this is too relatable
---
I've only shot it twice, the first time to see if I can kill it, the second time because I forgot if I could kill it or not
---
Clever
---
And in PvP, so, I don‚Äôt know wtf OP is on
---
Thank you, I will try out these methods when i have the opportunity to. I guess I just wished that the game had more solo player activities that's all.
---
You don't get it. It isnt the beast it once was. That was the point of the post. I don't understand why you have to attack me and my skill personally.
---
Go to anthem and realize your error

He died on impact.

There's a finite number of activities in the Dreaming City each week that are guaranteed to give a dreaming city item, but there's no telling what it will be. 
---

---
If you own the annual pass, you can do Ada-1's Dreaming City frame each week, because that is at least guaranteed to be a gun.
---
Those rocks can be deadly lol
---
F*** this petition, it‚Äôs the only map we can efficiently snipe on. Just bc you don‚Äôt like doesn‚Äôt mean that it should be removed from the game.

To be quite honest, I don't know. One of my team mates managed to kill themselves with 12 motes by not making the jump to the Bank, despite them being a Warlock. Then I died, and felt like a huge hypocrite for getting mad at the guy. Don't worry, I didn't yell at him, I wasn't in the general chat.
---
Rally and a titan does the job 
---
Edit: also couple ggs
---
Still not comparable to console population
---
They certainly were deadly during that match
---
Makes sense
---
It's from the Destiny app - Fireteams section.
---
Just as bad as fail safe DUNZZO
---
Thanks for your answer! Anybody know the lore and will be kind enough to share a summarized version of the history of these guns? Is it like thorn and rose (thorn is the corrupted rose)?
---
I think it's for the adventure that foreshadows the Leviathan raid, but it has been a *long* time since I did that adventure. It's the one located in the Cistern.
---
4th time I seen it
---
Yeah there was a contract between Sony and someone to get all the exclusives, but I just don‚Äôt know if it was Sony-Activision or Sony-Bungie. If it‚Äôs the first, we may finally have our first non-PS exclusive year lol, but if it was with Bungie, yeah, probably more exclusives.
---
The easier raid to learn is Scourge but you'll need a higher light level. Have you done the drifter bounties for 640 light? LW is doable but you may not contribute as much during those dps phases. Not quite sure as I've never had any less than 600 join in before.
---
Year 1 raids are very possible too if you're ok with non-powerful loot. Still some very good weapons tho.
---
Its already been like i said all the names are out dredgen hope, eli, germaine and wu ming.
---
Meh honestly raids are not a prime thing to do. You can still be very well equipped without doing the raids
---
So y‚Äôall just gonna ignore pornwolf on his friends list?
---
The power level of each raid depends on when it was added to the game. If you are vastly overpowered (I think 20 above the enemies), you are scaled down, to ensure they remain challenging activities. Leviathan is power level 300, Eater of Worlds is around 320-ish, Spire of Stars is around 380, Last Wish says "recommended 550" on it but I recommend around 570, and I recommend 640 or above for Scourge of the Past (Scourge requires the annual pass). 
---
What you should do to prepare is build up a supply of good weapons that you like and, to a lesser extent, armor. It helps a bit to have armor with reserves or scavenger perks for the guns you bring. I recommend looking for a fast-firing shotgun, such as IKELOS from [Escalation Protocol](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/992zbd/escalation_protocol_guide_all_the_info_in_one/) or Parcel of Stardust from Gambit. An easily obtainable weapon commonly used in raids is an Outrageous Fortune from Zavala with the perk spike grenades and field prep. Exotics to look for would be Lord of Wolves (random drop from Spider wanted bounties or Xur's engram), DARCI or Whisper of the Worm (good to have, not 100% necessary), and depending on your class, the exotic armors Lunafaction Boots, Hallowfire Heart, or Orpheus Rigs. 
---
Bringing enough raw damage is only half the battle, at most. Raids contain various mechanics not seen elsewhere, such as players all standing in specific spots at coordinated times, or one player calling out something visible to them alone and then everyone else shooting at some particular thing based on that information. There are a variety of guides you can look up, of variable quality, or you can find people to teach you in /r/destinysherpa. [This youtuber makes great guides, but he only has three raid guides right now](https://www.youtube.com/user/EpicTryHardGaming/search?query=destiny+2+guide).

Dredgen hope
---
So I would have to buy Foresaken + the annual pass? It‚Äôs $60 in Xbox store yes you are correct.
---
So what would the game be like for me if I just bought the annual pass?
---
You do know if d2 fails it can kill d3 right? Be happy with the good game we have.
---
Looking for clan posts are not allowed, please check out the Bungie clan search forums or our subreddit‚Äôs discord‚Äôs, LFG/Clan channels. Thanks.
---
You saying I wouldn‚Äôt get those things without Foresaken? Yea wondering about buying just one of them too (either annual pass or Foresaken) 
---
. The bundle of both of them is $60 on Xbox store.
---
Dude literally no one is talking about it because you should git gud. If anything in this game they made jumping easier because of the mantle. Its also a space game and the yes they purposefully make the jumping hard else there would be no challenge. If you don‚Äôt like jumping go play division.
---
The architects had to kill you. The level of big d*ck energy coming from a man using Drang without Sturm and Cerberus with Doomsday was too intense. They had no choice.
---
I agree, yet i see people hate the "carriers" more often than the ones paying to get carried and i just don't know why, no skin off anyones back as far as i can see.
---
Who is Otzot?
---
**THOSE ARE QUESTIONS FOR ANOTHER DAY, I SUPPOSE**
---
We as a community should try and do more to help these people out. Plenty of streamers and sherpas out there
---
Yup. I got mine as I reset my valour rank üëç
---
From what I know is that they had the same beginning (same body) but they took different paths. (One is fast, the other slow)
---
what are you? some kind of Warlock?
---
you get it for valor rank reset
---
I would go so far as to argue it wouldn't hurt anyone in PVP either if you think about it, if someone isn't good enough to grind for a luna/nf solo or willing to find a fireteam of like minded individuals to play with i doubt a luna/nf would improve their gameplay, in fact i kill people with lunas with my trust more often than not. but that's my own personal experience, take it with a grain of salt.
---
All good man. People get nasty here and I don‚Äôt like to participate in that. I wouldn‚Äôt say this is a meme. It‚Äôs just a picture to show someone‚Äôs ungodly gamer tag that shows how clever they are.
---
Fair point.
---
Yesterday, I met a PL610 with Outbreak Perfected. He said his mates had carried him through. I say: His bad, he missed out on a good experience being the tourist in a two-man-team rocking the show.
---
Some nice guys had carried me through Whisper, and I did not like it, afterwards. There is something to be said about "earning" your thing by the regular rules.
---
People that get carried are not different from cheaters and cheesers, in that regard. Which is totally fine. Feels a bit like someone showing off with his family's money, but wouldn't we all be tempted?
---
So overall, I don't mind whether he paid for it or was carried. Same thing and the only real victim there is the person itself.
---
Otzot is an advanced Psion Flayer who as the only one of her race managed to rebuild the OXA machine on the moon of Brand, a device used to see into the future. Seeing as rebuilding the OXA was a great feat, she gained the favour of Calus and became the imperial dreamer. Her motive for plotting against Calus is based on Calus freeing all enslaved Psions to become free citizens of the empire. She, who was born a "Freeborn" (not a slave to the cabal; something very rare and prestigious) disliked the fact that her title got diminished in terms of importance so she joined the midnight coup.

I use a corded Corsair gaming mouse.

So even more bizarre the speed of the mouse picks up to normal once I get back to Windows.

Best map ever. Killing snipers and scouts with my tone patrol is fun.

I've reached fabled 1 in the span of one day. I was actually hesitant on grinding for the recluse because of all the posts about reaching fabled being so hard but in reality it was actually pretty easy. I've got a 1.7 kd not sure if thats good or not or if that's why it was easy or I just got lucky? Can you guys help me out on explaining
---
Your submission has been removed due to being duplicate/over-posted content. Please try and use the search function on the right side of the sub.
---
Now that you make me think about it: Ironically, carrying makes it harder for the people doing the carrying.
---
The payer has three competent people doing the run in his absence, while the cheeser has to be babysitted, so the carriers need to be able to finish the run as a duo.
---
Hahaha my friend saw you 
---
Porphyria934
---
Im feel sorry for your friend
---
Specifically uck yes
---
I don‚Äòt call you dumb. not resetting when you could do is dumb.
---
The problem is not time after the grind, though. There, I agree with you: Doesn't matter, bad player (like me) stays bad player.
---
The problem is more during the transitional phase of grinding, where you get matched up with players which should not be where they are. This (allegedly) was a big problem with Overwatch, where ranking services were sometimes providing for very one-sided, unenjoyable games if you were on the other side.
---
Seeing that D2's matchmaking system is superbly bad and that team cohesion and thus synergies in good teams are not as pronounced as in OW, it might be that it does not matter that much, if some overskilled people are playing in lower tiers, as they would anyway.
---
Uck is infamous for his GT.
---
No one is sure exactly how to get this quest to drop. There are two good hypotheses I have seen: 
---
1. It has a high chance (but is NOT guaranteed) from resetting your valor rank, regardless of anything else you have done. This is how I got the quest. 
---
2. It is a random drop from the crucible but only *after* you have done at least one match of quickplay and comp.
---
It's basically just lucky.
---
Climbing in a very short amount of time = Luck
---
Climbing constantly = Skill
---
That said I also got Recluse in a single win streak, but I sure as heck was no One Man Army.
---
like more exotic sword?
---

---
CAN WE HAVE IT WITH SOUND!! I NEED TO HEAR IT!!!!!
---
I think people not knowing that you can find people friendly enough to help you for free is also part of the problem. Some time ago, on this subreddit's discord, there was someone who didn't know how to get into raiding, so I suggested /r/destinysherpa. Their resposne was "oh, I can't afford that," because they just assumed these people charged money! I was appalled.
---
I‚Äôll post it on YouTube when I get out of class, I have the clip on my PC
---
Literal pay wall
---
It‚Äôs in two different adventures
---
Do you feel the random exotic drops in the world are equivalent to what you were getting in D1?
---
For PVP it‚Äôs about fair matches. Paying a recovery service player (who is top tier skill usually) to go in lower/mid tier level skill activities (usually fabled and below territory) makes for unfair matches that are not fun. Newer players that encounter this enough are likely to be scared off from doing comp again. The player base in comp is already low as is.
---
If somebody has to cheese or do recoveries that‚Äôs a hollow victory. If you can‚Äôt make time to improve your skill, well, that‚Äôs on you. 
---
Chip away at long term goals, you‚Äôll have your weapons and get better in the process.

Quick comment: 2 of the night falls this week drop snipers, should I try to get one
---
I'm 700 tho?
---
Cries envious tear for Wavesplitter. Y‚Äôall get all the cool exclusives and we get the lfg feature.
---
Yes!
---
Personally, i would try grinding for a tartara gaze with kill clip, because after getting a kill with the weapon and reloading, you can get a 1 shot body shot.
---
Alternatively, you can use last word as cleanups for failed headshots from TG
---
Good shit man. I'm waiting on tangled shore flashpoint for my Variks book so I can finally get Chronicler myself.
---
I'm not familiar with tg, how do u get it?
---
Ah yes, the protractor gun
---
No, he doesn't want us to discover his weak spot to kill him... :)

I like where this is going

Congrats from a fellow Rivensbane

It took me three views of this clip to process what happened. Crucible is a magical place.

Is this an app? What's the best lfg these days, I've been out of the loop for maybe a year and am judt getting back into it before the next expansion.

I fucking heard this comment

Dang that sounds like that sucks, I just play solo and the max defeats in a row would be 3 and the highest win streak I think is around 12 and 14. Then after I had my butt handed to me for two games. Couldn't even score a single point. Its like a roll of the dice really
---
That is the Destiny Companion app.
---
Just get both.
---
Except being a wayfarer is still literally a 0. Dredgen isn't even hard now.
---
If you‚Äôre open to fusion rifles, erentil is a good choice (from banshee).  If you want a sniper, those already mentioned are good choices.
---
Yeah, according to [this infographic](https://old.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/bkp923/reckoning_weapon_drops_infographic/), tier 3 drops weapons that tier 2 does not.
---
Ok? Antiope was always solid and no lvl advantage in crucible lol. Last perdition (the pulse) is also a solid gun. Wierd flex attempt imo.
---
Yooo that's sick
---
Oh dear god, they have morphed into each other! *TR3-VR goes to leviathan* oh no *crown of sorrow never starts because the boss is too scared*

*oh no*

Twilight oath for sure. I also often use my ‚ÄúLast‚Äù load-out of Last Word and Last Perdition.

That Trevor is terrifying.

then there‚Äôs the people who write ‚Äú50+ clears, must have every exotic and talk fluent Russian.

May as well make a real one at this point

Every Trevor is terrifying.

I honestly don't get it

Shouldn't be. He only has exotics from Y1 and Forsaken in the fated engram.
---
Reading through the comments you don‚Äôt sound like the biggest crucible player I‚Äôm not going to tell you you can‚Äôt do it because I believe anyone can do it if they‚Äôre willing to put the time and patience in to learn competitive and get good at it
---
I guess we'll see
---
quickfang tho
---
Couldn't help you on that one. I would try looking up video files, formats and bitrate that Reddit except at the moment. It just might be that the video doesn't meet some of the qualifications.
---
Ayyyyyy good one
---
Thought that was Polaris for a second
---
:&gt;
---
It would be cool if Bungie gave us a 100 vault capacity increase each season to make room for all the new loot added in each new season
---
Personally, i agree with that completely. Its just depends on the type of person. For some, the journey is the best part. For others all that matters is getting to the end.
---
I guess thats why it doesn't matter to me. If you take the journey on and complete it, you will come out the other end a far superior player. If you just want to pay for the good stuff so you can fuck around with the game how you want who cares? We have already established they wont be as good a player who put in the work, so I dont see why its such a big deal.
---
Easy
---
Yeah give the difference of fov. This is on PC, so we get to change a lot of those options.
---
1.7 K/D or 1.7 KDA? Because those are two very, very different things.
---
Haha, at this point I don't think it mattered too much I think all of us were confused.

My bad thank you for informing me.

Yes. Trevor wants to meet you.

C'mon man, April was last month :P

Are recovs cheaper than carries or something?

That is SO GOOD!!! Wow... I wish I could do stuff like this
---
I fit two thirds of that post, Single and Warlock (I play Hunter and Titan too tho)
---
whoop di doo, you fell for b8
---
Its a good list though personally I'd switch the chaperone and the qurenbreakers bow because I wouldn't really use it in endgame missions and such.
---
When are we gonna get Destiny's version of surprised Pikachu? We need one already!

SUROS for me is A tier.

It really shines in Gambit Prime when everyone on the team is using it

I believe that translates to:

Low effort posts will be removed.

They're considered spam.
---
Rule 1.
---
Thorn definitely should not be F tier. I‚Äôd like to hear your reason behind this
---
Probably should denote a starting tile and direction of movement.
---
Direct-capture screenshots only.
---
No potato cellphone pics.
---
Rule 15.
---
To me Queenbreaker isn't the greatest option out there for things like raids and other PvE content, it's good, but not the best, and Chaperone is a good neutralgame weapon, leaning more towards PvP
---
Duplicate posts will be removed.
