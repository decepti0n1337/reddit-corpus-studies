Do I have to switch? Im lazy and would just rather use battle.net
---
---
---
You design armor?
---
You probably play Fortnite.
---
Also came here to say, this man is a savage.
---
If you don't switch you can no longer play the game on pc
---
I feel represented! :)
---
I believe once you cross save, if he. You unlink stuff your stuck for 90 days before you can cross save again. 
---

---
Also no to what he wants, he can’t move characters from 1 Xbox GT to another
---
He does, can confirm.
---
Damn alright ty
---
Will time played carry over?
---
What platform are you playing on and what content are you looking to do
---
If he unlinks/deactivates his xbox today would that prevent him from playing on steam? Thank on the response!
---
Forsaken and individual seasons (Forge, Drifter, Opulence) will be added at a later date for individual purchase
---
Dude that sounds nice.
---
Nah, it's a completely different infrastructure compared to Bnet and it's using Steamworks too most likely.
---
You guys get mad when people make fun of Destiny yet you do the same to other perfectly fine games.. why
---
Forsaken and the 3 seasons we have so far (Forge, Drifter, and Opulence) are not included in New Light and will have to be purchased separately in the future on steam if you do not currently own any of them
---
Oh yea, now actually getting around to doing it 😅
---
You'll need to message the Moderator Team first before posting any charity streams.
---
Failure to get mod approval beforehand is considered advertising.
---
Nope. Forsaken is not needed per se, you will miss out on exotics exclusive to that expansion, and you will not be able to play the campaign, but all strikes, pvp maps, and general gear from that expansion is available to all players
---
So I would need to get both of them? both forsaken and the newest one being shadowkeep?
---
I've played with against him in crucible a few times. Was fun trading fighting lion kills with him for a couple of games.
---
is there any kind of bundle for those two or are they entirely seperate?
---
You don’t need forsaken to be able to play and enjoy shadowkeep, but there’s a ton of fun content from forsaken and it’s annual pass(which is free) that I recommend people buy it if they really enjoy destiny.
---
What's with the Hunter? Lol
---
He’s doing his best
---
*starts twitching*
---
Im kind of confused because I dont see forsaken on steam or am i missing something?
---
You don't \*have\* to buy it if you don't want to. If you choose to play completely F2P, about 80% of the content is playable to you, including all strikes (dungeons), pvp maps, and game modes.   
---
If you do decide to buy Forsaken, it will unlock the campaign missions,  you will be able to visit the raid exclusive to that expansion (Last Wish), and obtain exotics that are Forsaken exclusive as well.
---
You can do it with an xbox one s/x controller too!(maybe elite 2.0 controller)
---
I noticed at the end he went fuck it and sat down lol
---
But they could just bundle Forsaken in there, no?
---
By your argument, since we've been power-levelled and Forsaken is irrelevant, **everything** before then is also irrelevant - except, from what I've been told, that's not true due to items dropping at your level.
---
Just got back into destiny 2. Been playing destiny since d1 house of wolves and didn’t like the direction it was headed after warming so I took a heavily exaggerated break for a while thinking I quit but I got sucked back in because I heard it was really good. Planning of getting forsaken here very soon and need a little bit of catching up on the game that I loved so much. That being said what’s oem?
---
Because of the move from Battle.net to steam silver and forsaken purchases have been unavailable on pc. They should be back on 10/1 when shadowkeep drops
---
Got it the first week
---
You guys are honestly inspirational with your dedication to this game. I'm a raging gamer since fuckin NES and I'm 30 yrs old, no tattoos. I've never loved a multiplayer game with a big community enough to like get into it as hard as you guys have. I tried to with Destiny and D2 (being a lifelong Halo fan), but never got to the point of obsession bc life and other games (not to mention some actual debilitating addiction problems I've since gotten under control) always got in the way. Anyway, I guess what I'm trying to say is, being a gamer I think this is admirable and not stupid, and you should go with what the tat artist mocks up for you after you show him the aforementioned logos. Those guys know their shit and if you gave him both (or all 3 was it?) I'm sure he'd produce something wicked for ya. However, if it were me I'd avoid the Gambit thing, simply bc it's a mode and not like a permanent self-identifying image/logo, ykno? They could ruin/pull Gambit, or you just like may decide it was a bad call getting it permanently inked on you. The Titan thing is solid tho bro, I'd for real give that to a Tattoo Artist and see what they can do with it. Cheers sorry for TL;DR
---
No there is not. Not unless you cross save to a console and buy the ornament on there.
---
Nah, ill use my warlocks new finisher move!
---
ohhhhh ok I see, one more thing, in your personal opinion and given me only owning the base and capping out at lvl 300 thus far, which would you say is more of a necessity to get first. I probably wont buy them both at the same time.
---
Thanks man
---
How about a brunette dog, does he find a bone?
---
Almost a sum of all tears! congrats man. Next time your in this position try to play a little more aggressive and the sum of all tears will be yours. if you can do it once you can do it twice
---
I've got rivensbane :D
---
I haven’t needed to win all of the time.  When i try hard, i use meta and play with friends.  When i’m not trying, i do whatever i want.  How many public event bosses get killed before making it heroic?  How many blights get destroyed?  How many exotic armor pieces are worn that don’t match their super or loadout?  How many players leave mid game after their bounty or dinner is done?  Learn to give less fucks when match making and the game is more fun during these times.  If you have your panties on, then get in a group because you sure as hell aren’t gonna ensure your team is giving one fuck about your dumb fuck opinionated loadouts let alone what gun you’re using....just like me.
---
Just when I thought I could delete that awful thing from my PC, modern warfare makes an appearance and looks worthwhile.
---
So true. He keeps such a calm demeanor in the most incredibly sweaty situations and is great at communicating strategies too.
---
Really? I thought sans in smash was to good to believe
---
hey! regarding blue gear being better than legendary gear at the moment, if i recall correctly, that’s just how it is earlier game due to rare weapons being power up rewards and legendaries just being random drops, especially at the start of forsaken, lots of blue weapons were handed out and i had to roll with a blue loadout.
---
soon enough, legendary items will get better than rare, but as you accelerate upwards in power/light level, blue weapons would be the fastest way to do so, as they drop more often. 
---
i hope i answered your question!
---
It might not. Other than Forsaken, there hasn't been any great content for Destiny 2. And let's be honest, Forsaken HAD to be great. If it wasn't, Destiny 2 would have died a long time ago. Now what I'm hyped for are all the changes, not really the content itself.
---
Oh right you have to go to the Farm for that, I legit forgot about that one lol
---
The free version won't include the new dlc that's coming out oct 1st, but it will include everything from the first year of destiny 2 and you'll get access to all the maps for everything. You could always just play that and if you like it buy shadowkeep to get access to newer content
---
So just rock the blue and wait until better gear drops? Should I just dismantle my legendary purple? All have power 10 somehow
---
Ok thank you!
---
You will need to own Forsaken to play the story missions
---
Nope
---
I’ll admit it I’ll admit it, I don’t like hunters
---
usually how i do things, yeah! after five characters on two different platforms that’s usually how it goes! dismantling would be recommended if the power level is lower than what your standard is, and you have no goal of infusing.
---
He's older than the class system though, that's why he doesn't really follow the set classes. He's one of the oldest Risen to exist.
---
Drop Mag 4 Life
---
I love how you actively went looking for him just for the joy of killing him for that.
---
I believe as soon is you get the triumph for 5 Valor resets in one season it'll count, you just have to do it at one point
---
You will not. You must hit the full 2100 this week if you want to reach fabled. We used to have a bug where your winstreak level could carry into the next season, but the glory rank will reset to 0 and you will receive no bonus for playing this week.
---
Try restarting the game
---
I haven't been to the tribute hall in a while, but isn't the captain a different enemy type than the others?
---
Which ever has the better roll
---
Im done playing for the night so hopefully it will work when im get back on
---
I won't lie, I'm alittle hyped.
---
Question for all the fellow guardians. Haven't played since Gambit was added, any reason for me to re-download the 97gigs on battle.net or should i just  wait for the relaunch? Heard something about gear boosting but wasn't quite sure what it meant.
---
It might not have registered. Try loading into a destination and trying again, or opening and closing the game.
---
If that doesn’t work, maybe try reseting it by hovering over gambit/gambit prime.
---
How does this fit so well on there? There’s no sync shots like the original, but it’s so much better lol good job
---
Delirium is a pinnacle weapon, it doesn’t have random rolls.
---
It’s October 1st now. Gambit isn’t available to base game until then.
---
Not preloading just means you have to wait for it to download, nothing stopping you from uninstalling the Bnet version before pre load
---
Sorry just found out you just have to complete a nightfall,thanks for the help tho
---
warlocks would win
---
This happened alot to me
---
Oh i did, i after i saw i couldn't reset i went to the tower to do some things and after that i went to play another match of prime
---
Depends on your activity
---
Pve: delirium
---
Pvp: Hammerhead
---
Gambit: Delirium if running a sniper, hammerhead if not
---
100% -  But it wasn't always this way, I think during Black Armory they made it retroactive
---
Sweet business really does do good sometimes
---
So pretty much from what I can tell, if you want it preloaded for Oct 1, but still want to play, you'll have 2 installs sitting on your drive(s) until the Preload for D2 on Steam goes live. Once that goes live, you'll no longer need your BNet install of D2 and you can uninstall that
---
Kinda. When you get a drop it either rolls as a regular legendary, a prime or an exotic. If it's a prime engram then it's already too late.
---
Every item and character is getting boosted to 750 power come October 1. You'll have to redownload for Steam so whether you want to download it twice in a week would probably depend on your speeds and any possible internet caps.
---
Your response still doesn’t make sense. Your point seems to be “if I’m matchmaking, my teammates might suck, so why should I do my best?” I see it as the opposite, if you’re playing with your friends, and they don’t care, then by all means use bad guns, but if you’re matchmaking, then sure some teammates might suck, but some teammates might actually want to win and you’re just hurting them. 
---
You say you do well with the Prometheus lens, but the coldheart is way better, so I don’t get why you would insist on using an inferior gun that isn’t any more fun to use unless you just really like red and not blue lol. Even if you’re team does suck from time to time, you might as well have the better gun that is just as fun to use just to give yourself and your team a better chance of winning
---
I don't see the difference
---
I feel your pain, I very much feel your pain.  this is why im farming menagerie so har to get my perfect beloved so I dont feel so bad for missing out
---
i think its solar singe, black out, grenadier or something. either way almost none of my groups out of about 25 runs had the dps to kill the boss.
---
KhakisHD has a vid about weapons and exotics to get before sk.
---
r/sharditkeepit is a good place to check if ur roles are good.
---
Fallout plays is a yter who covers weapons and perks, hidden stuff and what makes what good. He uses a tool called light.gg which shows you all possible roles on everything. It's really useful to check out.
---
It's listed in the rules
---
I really like the Hive aesthetic, something about alien wizards using magic and curses against people with sci-fi guns just looks great to me. That fucking aoe slow + dot cloud they use in Warmind can fuck right off though.
---
This can also work for Uldren-
---
I like the Thorn better tbh I use it in comp because it has 2 head shot kill without it's buff and I'm pretty good at aiming so after I collect the remnant i just casually go around killing with 1 shot to the head or 2 body shots
---
I got the curated one sometime last year when the light level was 600 and I threw a shader on it got 44 kills and forgot about it.
---
So how will invites work in steam? Is it possible to invite people without having them on your steam friends list?
---
My sincere apologies for having an opinion.
---
Trust hand cannon, with dragonfly and explosive payload perks. Dropped when i was like 500 light and used it ever since.
---
I was doing that last night. Bottom tree Striker with Synthoceps. It was the most fun I've ever had in Crucible, just running around and punching people. 
---
Counted six kills before a red hunter solo-barraged me.

---
*loads pistol*
---
Im really not in the scene anymore but when i played d2 on pc everyone just used to laugh at him getting beaten on stream by people they know. Beaten him a few times myself, he wasnt really an a tier player at any point.
---
For the solar kills I used the Elatha FR or an Outlast, depending on the map and the opposing team.
---
For the precision kills I used a Austringer as primary and a Trust as energy and I used the Lucky Pants.
---
In 10k sim seeds, you should see roughly 80-90 cores. 10-15 mod components and 3-5 exotics. Atleast in my experience
---
oh heh ye sure

But nice work!
---
That’s good then 👍
---
What will the max light level be for basegame owners when we get boosted to 750?
---
You got me there :) Everybody has his strengths, so it's all good
---
You will still be required to have forsaken. D2 on steam comes with base game, warmind and osiris dlcs. Anything within forsaken you need to buy separately.
---
Any specific perks?
---
Also what do you think about sunshot?
---
Mine isn't perfect, but it has Rangefinder and Outlaw.
---
If you're using lucky pants Quickdraw and Opening Shot work amazing...
---
Ok
---
Upon closer inspection of my luck, I found I was blessed with snapshot with rampage/demolitionist. Oh well.
---
Righto. !RemindMe 3 days
---
I've used steam for nearly 11 years and never have or heard about this. Sounds like you might need a new ssd/hdd
---
That's great...good luck
---
Or cerridious. God I want to be as good as that man
---
70 keys for LW, still no 1k. Have everything else.
---
It was a glitch that lasted a week or two in crotas end. essentially what you would do was drop his shield then as he dropped to his knee you fire team leader would pull out their lan cable if it was done right he would stay on his knee for the rest of the encounter, so kill sword bearer then kill Scrota.

3 full SoS Prestiges today, 7 catalyst drops, none were mine... One guy joined for the first and second chest and got the emote. Never done the raid before. He immediately left. I have the emote but honestly I’d trade it in a heartbeat for the catalyst or a single raid weapon for that matter...
---
I hit 30 without trouble in D1. Now I’m forever 29 but the exotic version.
---
As far as I understand it, 750 is becoming the new floor. They scale enemies to your light level anyway, so you won’t be all that over powered if you replay the campaign.
---
Yes
---
That's the idea
---
It will be automatically. Every character and every item will be boosted to 750 as soon as Shadowkeep comes online...
---
I wouldn't worry too much about one shotting everything though, Destiny usually scales enemies to your power level
---
Why should it be different and need to posts to point out that they look the same? If it’s going to the same place, **WHY NOT** make them look the same?
---
Indeed
---
Rapid hit is just so nice that it doesn’t require a kill to proc.

Forsaken purchases are disabled, at least for PC.

Yeah I've never played that particular franchise and probably never will. Halo, which I did play for a long time, had the same problem and I stopped playing that. When its a criticism of not only destiny but the wider gaming community, that you yourself have exemplified in your point then how can it be a moot point? Destiny may be marginally less culpable to it but they are still guilty all the same. "Do this strike! Sepiks Prime is a bigger servitor - Wow!" "Oh we re-did a bunch of old stuff and we made the boss at the end different.. but it's still a big servitor - wow!" "Do this raid! The boss is a big Taken Knight - wow!" And guess who's coming back this DLC... Its all the bosses we've already killed before being resurrected by 'ThE dArKnEsS' OOOOOOOHHHHHHH! Do you have a point pertinent to the question at hand or are you here to continue touching yourself over Deej's fat pay packet you contributed to for the same junk year in year out?

WE’VE AWOKEN THE HIVE
---
Just my hunch, but I assume that if the supers introduced in Forsaken will be attainable in Shadowkeep we will find out about it tomorrow in the  TWAB.
---
I could honestly see them going either way at this point.
---
*Truth* can do that. Tracking/Hakkë rockets can... sorta.
---
Ok thanks!
---
Iirc all the euros catalyst does is make the health gain from a kill happen either always or most the time. I'd pick breakneck over it 100% cause then you can use other exotic slots
---
Suros is literally the only viable auto, and it’s disgusting. There’s no point going for breakneck in the current game state.
---
Sunshot is good, mindbenders ambition if you like shottys, if you don't have one hand in hand works (shotgun). If you're more of a pulse guy right side of wrong is a good solar pulse. I see they already mentioned beloved.
---
Thanks for the advice
---
Imagine if legendary shard were a real thing and were stronger than diamonds
---
Y2 seasons and Forsaken are now old content and old content is discounted. You can wait a year or two and get Shadowkeep + Y3 seasons cheaper, as you can do for any game.
---
It's a year 1 exotic my dude. Buy a fated Engram from xur and it will be guaranteed to drop.
---
It looks nice but it can’t really expand the library and retain its look. Also though its downloads break all the time
---
My only hope for the Steam migration (although i'm pretty sure i will be disappointed) is that the state of the servers will be better! I can't play 6v6 matches or be in the tower (specially if it's crowded) without being kicked because of error codes (weasel, anteater, bee, bat....etc)
---
Mind you this is the only title that i have problems with! and i tried literally everything in Bungie's Network troubleshooting guide to no avail.
---
Hunters can tether and hopefully keep their distance and shutdown their supers
---
Doing comp is a waste unless you're the luckiest person and get only clash or control. They nerfed the questline so it's super easy to make progress just stick to qp, use fighting lion and militias or something...Luna well or titan barricade too
---
Right, they have said existing items will not convert, but have to be reacquired.  I'll be dismanting every eververse item (for bright dust) and every piece of armor I'm not wearing on my character before the 1st.
---
Well if you're only missing one exotic shouldn't xur get the job done for you?
---
one of the saddest things about D2 is that there are so many cool looking areas like this in the game that you just speed through on your way to fight something else.
---
These Graphics in this game are so fkn satisfying
---
There's an emote for that XD
---
"Now see, Donny's gonna take that bat of his there and beat yer ass to death with it"
---
The only thing that should change is that you get an early xp and LL score boost
---
What playstyle do you suggest as a solo player against full stacks that’s not dependent on teammates cooperating?
---
What did it cost
---
Location locked , edge transit firing
---
1. Yes, all gear is being boosted to 750 on October 1st, and armor 2.0 will be dropping.
---
2. Menagerie is part of the Year 2 Annual Pass content. This Annual Pass content is now free for anyone that owns Forsaken, and Forsaken is now $24.99 USD sold as the "Complete Collection". Menagerie is a lot of fun, and here's what I use to see what loot you can get from it [Rune Combos](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/byr6rd/menageriecalculator_show_all_possible_rune/).
---
3. Make sure to dismantle all Eververse gear you can part with as after Oct 1st it will dismantle into Legendary Shards instead of Bright Dust. I'm keeping most of my non-eververse gear as there's not really an advantage to dismantling now instead of later.
---
4. I would check the meta weapon list on r/CruciblePlaybook for the current top picks, but it's probably going to change a bit next week when SK drops.
---
at this point don't waste any cores, next reset is when shadowkeep drops unless i'm mistaken and everything gets bumped to 750 anyway so save the cores. all ap stuff is now free for forsaken owners, but you have to complete some quest steps before you can access it. just play mayhem for now, not a lot of time to grind for god rolls before shadowkeep hits
---
Editing style is really good some shots in time with the music. It’s actually pretty good.
---
Just do quickplay. I did it with a warlock with wel and empowering rift and lunafactionboots. Running a militia birthright with auto loading holster and spike, fighting lion and a play of the game with proxemety grenades. I played half of the time with a friend that distracted players so i could spawn kill with the fighting lion for double kills
---
Take a look at this ([https://www.niris.tv/blog/2019/7/22/how-destiny-2-shadowkeep-will-work-in-october](https://www.niris.tv/blog/2019/7/22/how-destiny-2-shadowkeep-will-work-in-october)),it should answer all your questions.
---
I think they’re only the seasonal artifacts, afaik artifacts are how you get new mods
---
I'm sure he's gonna have some questions when he shows up to the tower and everyone stares angrily at him, and he gets put as the hunter vanguard.
---
completed bounties are for the ikora 20 bounties weekly milestone, there's also the werner bounties for next week which requires vanguard/crucible/gambit bounties, can't remember which one it is though. there's also dreaming city bounties for the weekly powerful.
---
I’d F but since the due is playing console I’m not sure what the button I need is
---
Funny cause I use super suppressing supers on my Hunter just for bottom Tree Strikers. 
---
I see a warlock with dawnblade, NO
---
I see hammer titan, NO
---
I see spectral hunters, NO
---
I see Striker, ABSOLUTELY
---
It's by far my best. Glad you like it 👍

Yeah true bud

If I heard correctly, new characters will be at 750 light if that helps

Thank you

Catalysts can’t drop twice
---
That one isn’t every good looking honestly, the eye of Osiris is what you want.
---
All of the weapons and armor you unlock on PS4 will be exactly the same when you decide to fire up the PC version. The difference between owning the $35 version of Shadowkeep is that you get to play the campaign, raid, and obtain season of the undying specific exotics. All other rare, legendary, and exotic gear is available to all players, regardless if they have paid for the expansion or choose to play entirely free.  
---
You already own the license for the game on all platforms, and since the base game will be free to download, you actually do not require the disc anymore to start up D2. Just make sure that your "master account" is the one you have bought all of the expansions and seasons on.  
---
Sorry for the somewhat lengthy and response, but I want to make sure there is no confusion, I'd be more than happy to answer any follow up questions you might have.
---
As a Titan main, I love the new Raid armor. It's barely a "reskin," and it looks much cooler than the Omega Mechanos sets anyways. This is definitely my favorite D2 Raid armor so far
---
Well, um, hide? Stay around corner, use emotes to peek. Truth won't magically seek you anywhere and behind any cover.
---
ok XD
---
Yes, I even have the dance that the Warlock and Titan does lol
---
pick?
---
Yep, since Ace of Spades is a quest reward tied exclusively to Forsaken, you will have to buy the expansion as well in order to obtain the weapon.  
---
I would personally recommend that you just wait for a price drop in the coming months/weeks, but the decision is really up to you
---
or rather the catalyst should make the orbs you get slowly creep towards you, so picking them up is easier.
---
True. in this one though his teammates names are green which means they queued together
---
f
---
Uhm... what was it again?
---
Cause blade barrage takes skill 😒

uff i dont know. but you dont really see it bc its so dark so i dont cared about the armor...

---
yup... it took me over a year to fully build my PC
---
the real question is "What end game?" lol.
---
Your wife the THE WORST
---
Lmaooooo
---
Don't forget faction emotes
---
I thought I read something about them adding more ways to obtain seeds of light. Cant remember where I read it tho
---
The NF was a really good hand cannon but everyone is saying that it is trash on PC now
---
I've tried that a few times and he usually just runs out of it and shield slams me off the map 😭

Did it give his ghost new abilities? Why doesn't he kill himself and have his ghost Rez him so the arm is fix?
---
Nice idea and useful if bungie implement more abilities that affect positioning such as that exotic heavy bow coming in Shadowkeep
---
I'm bad at PvP so a solid 10/10
---
I work as an employee for the Vanguard
---
I agree lol I even have the dance equipped that the Warlock and Titan does
---
I know, 150s are the most use hand cannon on PC. *Coughs in Spare Rations*
---
Something surfaced during shadowkeep and now people think you have to be power level 999 (Which you can be) to end the curse and get the last wish.
---
lol man we were grinding last night for 5 hours for the recluse and only went up 200 glory.... im worse than u
---
Teleporters and a keen eye helps. Yeah they can see you but you can also see them on the radar, also if you're a headphone user or have a good sound system, turn music down and ambience/sfx up and you can easily distinguish a players footsteps and out maneuver them.
---
hahahhahahah YUP every Freaking match you will see it!
---
r
---
sorry bout that!
---
I did see people using it on console, but it is rare that you’ll see it.
---
"That was a wizard, from the moon"
---
Well yes but no but yes but no but yes but no
---
Doesn’t need it. I use it to one shot other ults in PvP it’s just fine, plus with skullfort, infinite shoulder charge (plus health regen after).
---
its so hard to go against it.... I lose almost every time
---
You could have saved it FOR THE BOSS

Anyone that owns Forsaken (previously, now, and in the future) has access to the Year 2 Annual Pass content (Black Armory/Season of the Forge, Joker's Wild/Season of the Drifter, and Punumbra/Season of Opulence) as of September 17th 2019.
---
I’m offended. How could you call me a dingus. You bad face person.
---
Imagine having to ask permission to access the money you earn.
---

So if not having access to 35 dollars  of my own in order to purchase a video game add on  is part of marriage. I most likely made the right choice on skipping out on that.  No offense intended.
---
I'd rather have warlock dress than hunter's cape :)
---
It’s called being considerate. When you’re married it’s no longer “you’re money”, it’s “our money”.
---
This is amazing!

Bought borderlands to pass the time (worth it btw)
---
Okay, that makes sense. 
---
Thank you for the answer! It's not confusing at all. :) 
---
The only follow up I have is this. If moving forward, I buy Shadowkeep and future seasons on the PS4 and NOT the PC, and I  earn season specific exotics on the PS4. Will my character still have them if I fire up the PC version? I understand the new story and raid stuff will only be available on the PS4 in this case. 
---
Thanks a lot!
---
how is this a repeat post you fuck
---
&gt;hey babe do you mind if I blow 40 bucks
---
-OR-
---
&gt;mommy can I please have 40 dollars
---
Which one does OP most conform to?
---
Yo, I’ve read through everything you’ve said and asked and if you’re on console you will be able to get the 750 light boost and access to everything right away.
---
Have a feeling you sre just bad at pvp and want guns nerfed that you dont like... just a hunch tho lmao
---
We also couldn’t give sweeper bot anything which really upset me
---
I swear that rock kills me more than other Guardians on that map
---
Let's pretend I needed this in a frame in my office. How would one go about purchasing it?
---
Could have but I didn't.
---
If the goal is to have an internal balance system then it won’t work was my point but I mean it’s not an opinion, I didn’t state an opinion, I made a statement of fact, dawnblade for example is not balanced, anyone who says otherwise is wrong, any super ability that allows me to cross the map twice in one duration isn’t balanced, and isn’t that what people cry about from the striker titan anyway?
---
Your wife is awesome &lt;3
---
This is too gore hahahaha
---
1k on chest 65 Anarchy on Comp 35, you can do it
---
Add insult to injury on the FIRST OF OCTOBER, Last of Us Remastered comes FREE on the PS Store... let's just say I'm never leaving my room
---
Thanks, will definitely keep that in mind.
---
Look at your name
---
SWING BATTA BATTA BATTA BATTAAAA SWINGGGGG

Couple of holes like this on Io and a few areas on Nessus too.
---
I’m not going to judge but how the fuck would that work since she’s a computer
---
u/WendallBK

Sorry I didn't mean it was going to be easy to kill BB and SS but that it was going to be easy to kill hunters because of the roaming supers they have. Both warlocks and hunters have two choices for one and done supers and the rest roam, so it's not catered to hunters specifically. I would say Titans kinda have two options for 'one and done' but missile can be shot out of the air NOW in this metta. bubble is really the only one and done super.
---
The reality is that supers should NOT be unstoppable. The best counter should NOT be to suicide off the map! And 'one and done' supers are unlikely to get a 5 kill streak and replenish the rest of the teams supers with orbs allowing for a super chain that's just unbeatable. It's give and take and you might not like it but it's how it should be.
---
Old meme so it would be hard to find
---
but mUh pOwEr fAntAsY.
---
this is the main argument bad players use to excuse their last word/erentil or bygones/jotunn while complaining about spare rations and shotgun. Many weapons need bans but no one is gonna do it because bungie would rather everyone get kills and succeed rather than it actually being 100% skill based
---
Even then, 8% is a random trash talker and 2% is actually props.
---
You can block the taken blast with a sword? Does it cancel the knock back? If so that’s gave me some mighty fine ideas.
---
I would be fine with that if we at least had the ability for every exotic to track kills in PvP and pve and not just those with a catalyst
---
Yeah good thing it wasn’t truth huh
---
OEM makes even the crappiest D2 player good in quick play.
---
Well let's pretend you do I would save image in large it then print then frame well this is all metaphorically speaking
---
4 of us took 2 people on their first run through. Got a double drop. One guy on his first ever clear and me, on my 3rd clear 🤷‍♂️
---
Do you mean flinch so hard it knocks you out of ADS?
---
It was inspired with fallout
---
Damn space wizards! Messing up all us space hunters.

*Chad leaves in silence, leaving the Shadowkeep copies behind*

Yes I do. Think Halo.

Kissing your spouse is rude?

Definitely Calus

Yes I do. Think Halo

Dude Ana Bray LOOKS the best.... she ain’t the best tho :(
---
But does she shout:”THE ROUT IS ON GUARDIAN, FINISH THIS!!” when you get a nice streak? 
---
If so, that is not your girlfriend, that is lord Shaxx.
---
Smash or pass D2 edition please do video
---
that was when IGN was given free IPADS during E3

Hive: \*Does something on the moon\*

Guardians: How many times do we have to teach you this lesson Hive Witch?
---
It will get rid of the tracking and make it only have one shot and put it in the heavy slot, sick
---
Whether we wanted it or not, we’ve stepped into a dance battle on the Moon. So let’s get to serving the opposition, one by one.
---
how many lsds can I get for 35
---
This is the first I have heard of that method. If it works I’ll let you know soon nice I have thousands of crucible and vanguard tokens
---
Raids are fun to play, and have many great rewards.  It's definitely more fun to play with friends, but if you're like me and don't have friends who play Destiny, LFG is your best bet.  More often than not, LFG is great.  People will put stories of bad experiences out there, which makes people worried about using it, but it really isn't as bad as most people make it out to seem.
---
r/DestinySherpa is a great place to go if you are learning how to do a raid and need people to teach you.  Looking up raid guides by Datto and other YouTubers also helps immensely, since you get to see how the fight goes before walking in yourself.
---
Ahh ok that makes sense. I had it backward, thought the # of knife impacts determined the amount of regen.
---
Ah the radius. Not sure if that’s what happened here but they ain’t hittin right.
---
Tasteful cloak placement around the crotch is tasteful.
---
No.
---
This reads like something that a 13 year old would write to their mom. I don't think I'll ever understand this "I have to ask my wife for money." thing. Me and my SO have been together for almost 5 years now and if I want to buy something I buy it. We trust each other to be responsible with our finances.
---
Reset
---
Shadowkeep, how you doin.?
---
I didnt see a "no" so thats an automatic yes right?
---
You... Have to ask?
---
Who wouldn't? The real question is would you smash the discount version?
---
Will be at reset  @ 6pm UK time (I'm also uk) Although Destiny is being taken offline for maintenance at 6pm Monday until 6pm Tuesday when Shadowkeep goes live.
---
I'd have a 3 sum with both...
---
I see
---
The curated pulse rifle drops from the final chest
---
Wdym butt hurt? Also it is bad game design because it takes away from the story while breaking the lore with the excuse that in lore your guardian is the chosen one.  Also it does fit if they hadn’t made a lore breaking story in the first game and they could have done something in the 2nd game to fix it.  You are looking at it based on its current story not what could have been which is a fault most people have when something like gets criticized.
---
"The greatest game of hide and seek has begun".
---
Who knows we hear a nightmare ghost in the new trailerp
---
*Cries in working full time job*
---
they'll probably bring it back but make it an auto rifle that shoots in 3 round bursts.
---
I'm more hyped
---
Why do you have to ask to spend 35$?
---
Very rare. But hey, I can rock the 3 pinnacle weapons at the same time.
---
She should say it when you’re about to fire your gun.
---
My husband and I both play and he bought Shadowkeep for both of us. I got an email with my gift message literally saying what you did. I almost died laughing at work!
---
That’s incredible! I only started the game back on PS3 and never finished it. This is great news! Gives me something to do until 1pm EST when I can play Shadowkeep lol. I actually am stoked tho, thanks for the heads up
---
Mine was Cayde-6... before... *breaks down into tears*

1pm EDT happens when this comment is 19 hours and 40 minutes old.

No worries it's such an amazing game as well
---
Don't worry about Shadowkeep, spent that money on a divorce attorney /s
---
_Unless..._
---
Complete the seal then I think you have a limited time to purchase the seal from Bungie.net can’t exactly remember I was broke when I got my rivensbane so didn’t get it
---
Already did it anyway
---
Are you doing them in the Hollows ?
---
Nice
---
So I just did the 25 melee portion of it, now it really doesnt say what to do? Guides say earn EXP, Generate Orbs and Complete a challenge, but it isnt tracking it at all?  Did i miss something?
---
This
---
Testing
---
I had no idea it was a real remix! I just figured Bungie's in-house composer made it specially for the trailer. I used to listen to the original all the time so hearing it in the trailer was an awesome blast from the past :)
---
All you did was make assumptions(this is reddit after all). I never once said I couldn't beat them when in fact I can(multiple seasons of legend). I was just making a post trying to get Destiny comp(at least) to require skill and be talked about from numerous outlets about being a good comp game &amp; it should deserve spotlight like CSGO or CoD.
---
Jokes on you, that’s the ghost that revived Uldren, and we are ripping it to shreds
---
Ever since vanilla powerful gear has been the only way to increase power levels. Oh well. Guess I will see if I am wrong on launch day
---
Court??
---
Where is my moons haunted meme
---
Barely.
---
ghosts are just door openers
---
I would use it but I would still try to get a reload perk.

It's just super annoying to not be able to counter a sniper at long range with anything but another sniper or hiding.
---
Yea I have like 700 crucible tokens to blow :b
