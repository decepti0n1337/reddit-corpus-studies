Yes, it was changed a few months back to be available 24/7 any time there is a public event in the right spot.

You cannot enter heroic Whisper if you haven't completed normal Whisper.

---
Damn you can‚Äôt charge back at all?
---
Sniper perk is novel, but there are already some insane snipes in the game that it doesn‚Äôt make the comp grind worth it. Gambit bow has a cool perk but idk about you but I mainly ads with bows so idk how often I would be using the perk. And the grenade launcher is strange and seems situational? They just don‚Äôt seem worth the grind at all.
---
Why not? Some guns were way too fun to lose.
---
That would be neat too.
---
Lol
---
Yeah, the only weapon worth the grind for comp is recluse. Also it cant compete against ikelos or recluse in pve
---
How do I do that sorry for my ignorance
---
Not gonna lie, all of these kinda suck
---
Oh it is by no means going to be anywhere near meta, or at least I dont think so, I just think it will be fun to mess around with.
---
That looks like a short zoom sniper with a decent perk, so I wouldn't count it out
---
Contact your bank or PayPal and tell them it was a scam and you didn‚Äôt get what you payed for.
---
imagine putting down a well and go to town with wendigo on riven
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
PVP pinnacle is as strong as ever
---
and...we finally got a not top tier gambit weapon
---
Farm heavy. Preferably meta toxic weapons. When you see a super pop, panic super them with whatever you can. Go fucking bonkers, yeah?
---
Thanks! Hoping to get them before end of the season!
---
Lakim - A Pimp Named Slickback
---
Irritating. Titans are OP and hunters are overplayed
---
What do we have to do to get these weapons i swear if comp is dor the crucible one im commiting sodoku puzzle and drinking black coffee for the rest of the season.
---
Hmmmmm. That's a nice feature. Said feature would make running a shot gun an absolute nuthouse!
---
it‚Äôs funny that orbs of light will increase damage. sound familiar?
---
Indeed my fellow feature enthusiast
---
I want the hush
---
Hawk moon it‚Äôs going to be the raid exotic
---
I use it all the time. Even for oddball quests I usually get a team together in 5 minutes or so. You may want to post for what you need a few times cuz it doesn‚Äôt take long for your post to get buried by other posts. Still, pretty efficient usually.
---
you‚Äôre making me think of Cayde-6 and now i‚Äôm just sad
---
break ice?
---
How recent was this?
---
Bad ass dude!
---
It hasn't changed your just unlucky
---
Thanks for cheering me up
---
Yeah if you can get those early sneak plants off it really throws them into chaos mode. It's rare to happen but always a blast
---
I, I love this game. This game is just awesome
---
Top kek

Perfection
---
Let's  go!
---
He is what disposed of all of our dismantled weapons in D1. He has grown incredibly strong from this.
---
Ambush?üëÄ
---
We just did that without any interruptions.
---
I know I'm so proud
---
TR3-VR is that which we fear most. It is inevitable, unstoppable, indestructible, cannot be distracted, cannot be reasoned with. It has no mercy. no malice, no thought. It simply acts, and those acts cause Guardians to die.
---
Much like Taxes.
---
It‚Äôs only available from the oracle offering during max curse week.  So next week you should get it.
---
Are you sure you're doing the offering on strongest curse week?
---
As someone who's seen the effects offered by PowerDirector youissed out on using some gloriously ugly effects
---
Yes it's all rng and terrible game design. Getting all nodes is gonna take hours, if not days and 1000's of stems. You also need schematics that are rare af in order to get the 4 weapons on the collections badge. And after getting your first schematic of the day, drop rates for them drop significantly. And it's not that if you turn in a schematic, you're guaranteed a weapon you don't yet have. This is also rng. Like i said, terrible game design and i can't believe that they haven't fixed this yet.
---
It certainly isn't a feature. Right after my PS4 started that shit, I defragged my drive and my updates don't copy since. So SOMETHING is causing it.
---
Now that I see the pinnacle weapons again, my anxiety is slowly creeping back
---
You seem to have a little bit of purple in all your drawings.....but it may be a coincidence
---
Revoker returns your missed shot after a certain amount of time, pretty excited since I‚Äôm bad at sniping, and this will definitely get me to snipe a little more in comp. always love trying to get good at new things
---
I'm not sure because they used to only be in the weekends and i don't know if they've changed that. But anyone with the heroic, can access it through the map anytime.
---
Wow what a great achievement im literally shaking omg we did it yay!1!
---
Ain't no party like a wandigo party.
---
batman wants to know drifter's location
---
"missed shots are returned to the magazine"
---
IM NEVER RELOADING AGAIN BOIZ
---
Why does anyone care? This game is pretty mediocre with literally no info on the future of tha franchise aside from more eververse microtransactions. The fact that a lot of you still give this game your time still blows me away, you all must really love all that rehashed content over and over and over again. Do you all also subscribe to WoW?
---
The game is pretty expensive 60 base game, 35 warning, 35 CoO, 60 Forsaken 40 Annual Pass. It is worth it, but it‚Äôs hella expensive if you‚Äôve been playing since the beginning
---
Nope,it's the pre-corruption thorn aka the rose
---
People said the same thing about mountaintop and recluse.  
---
Just wait to use them first.
---
Yeah, truly a missed opportunity on my part :/
---
My longest was 5 and i only have 3 exotics i enjoy. (Orpheus,celestial nighthawk and st0mpies)
---
The bow might and probably does have some crazy aim assist that allows for easy precision shots that will make it extremely powerful
---
Sniper seems aight and the grenade launcher is just straight trash
---
i doesnt take that long lmao.
---
Chaperone
---
This time it‚Äôll be different!
---
You know the existing surge quest?
---
Haha that‚Äôs just coz I‚Äôve not drawn a purple Titan yet ‚ò∫Ô∏è I‚Äôve done titans!! Just not a purple one to put with this selection. You can see more of my work on [instagram!](www.instagram.com/emilymeganxart)
---
Big up! Blink would be an awesome if you could take a straight shot in the air from coming out of the blink.
---
Haha sure! Message me ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
Thank you so much :3
---
Thank you! No just [instagram](www.instagram.com/emilymeganxart)  atm!‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
Yes that helped a lot. I am still debating so I came back to this old post. 
---
So I have a new question. What happens if I wait until August/September, will there be a NEW annual pass? Will I never be able to do the things/get the loot from the current annual pass, or will it still be available?
---
Twilight oath and The supremacy
---
Yes! Finally someone made the connection!!üòÇ
---
You don't even need to buy Warmind and CoO now, they come with Forsaken. It's 60 for base, 40 for forsaken and 35 for annual pass, which, while expensive is not *too* bad.
---
You didn‚Äôt do the annual pass though? Are you not at the point where you would need it or something? Are you going to buy it? I do love Destiny. I am thinking of doing forsaken and no annual pass, wait until the next annual pass comes out. But idk what happens then, if I will never be able to get/do stuff from the current pass.
---
I oddly like solo'ing public events but maybe since I moved to asia there isn't enough of that going on and now i'm just straight solo or solo + 1 player'ering events and it's kinda boring.
---
If I buy the season pass, does Solo get better or stay the same mostly?
---
Lol. I might consider that but, nah.
---
I like helping people and understand that each and every player stood in the same position as I am now - a raid noob. 
---
I just hope they didnt re install D1 because of a bump on the road, so I hope other players or human beings are glad to help as well.
---
Thank you.
---
Absolutely yes, and feel free to call on fellow guardians if you need help with some of the quest!  Hope you come back!
---
I would say connection issues. Dawnblade is pretty forgiving on hit registration.
---
The game is not made for solo only play - and farming public events isn't really the end game but rather a weekly thing you need to do for the flashpoint. 
---
The season pass will not really add much of solo play, not that there is a lot in the first place. 
---
Black Armory: The forges have matchmaking and the frames can be done solo. 
---
Jokers Wild: Gambit Prime and Reckoning have matchmaking but Reckoning gives you gear for gambit and you don't enjoy that it seems. 
---
Exotic quests will be difficult if not impossible to solo. 
---
Hard to say really - I'd advise against getting it.
---
Darkness. Nah. I‚Äôm assuming by the end of D2, we‚Äôll have killed what‚Äôs her face that‚Äôs responsible for the Curse and claimed Oryx‚Äôs crown. MAYBE we‚Äôll see something more than just ships by the end, but I wouldn‚Äôt count on it.
---
They‚Äôre going to reset us for D3, don‚Äôt even think otherwise.
---
This is awesome! Would you be willing to share a link of high res versions?
---
Lookin real good!
---
As said by someone else though, more titan is needed. üëåüèª
---
Yup.  I know.
---
I'd be willing to pay a few $ if that helps you out
---
And that is why I do not PvP in D2.
---
Sucks that so many quests involves PvP.
---
When I played on NA it was really vacant (think like 3AM-7AM).
---
I made up for it though lol
---
It‚Äôs just ashame it‚Äôs getting nerfed
---
It's the top DPS special, and one of the top DPS weapons in the game.
---
The need to Luna will be same nerf to not forgotten
---
I love the wonky physics of d2
---
So just skip a bunch of leveling in a shorter than you would like because you don't want to grind? I'm sorry but this is Destiny, not a casual COD game.
---
Yeah, I've been playing a bunch the last week or two, specifically to give my Novalock w/SoDA a last gasp of godliness before the nerf. With that said, I don't have Phoenix Protocol, so if the SoDA nerf makes nova bombs much less viable, I probably won't be coming back very much.
---
As someone who got the not forgotten this is very true
---
[me rn](https://imgur.com/gallery/HQJOFSV)
---
I think they don't b/c its a cheap way to populate the game.  I still can't believe you need to go outside the game to get trackers and info on your progress.
---
Hello?  911?  
---
Yes, hi.  I'd like to report a murder.
---
Bitch slap from another world
---
I just burned another 4 and still got the ones I already scanned. This is bulls shit.
---
It depends on how you define valid.  
---
Can you win with other weapons? Yes.  
---
Would you win more consistently with a shotgun? Yes.  
---
Would you win bny a greater margin with a shotgun? Yes.  
---
  
---
The fact is that right now it only takes one hit to kill someone with a properly godrolled shotgun even at ranges out to 9 or 10 meters.  That gives it the fastest ttk and the nature of the maps mean that you can easily stay in areas that play to that range.  Some GL's can kinda counter them if your psychic powers are strong, but that's not enough to deal with the one shot problem.  
---
I'm not too worried, I figure they'll bring the SG ranges back in line with the next round of balance changes, and things will get back to normal pretty quickly after that.
---
* gwin is dumb broken 
---
* Foetracer sucks since enemys must be low making it useless 
---
* shards were decent but got destroyed 
---
* coyote just gives another dodge for relod ?Yeay?
---
* dragon shadow is weak
---
We're mostly NA with a few EU feel free to message me on Discord @Sovie‚Ñ¢#5239
---
Still going for mine can‚Äôt rest yet unfortunately
---
All I know is that the new hunter armor is sexy as hell
---
The Gambit Ship. You can only get it by beating the Taken Servitor (meatball) , along with the Gambit sparrow.
---
Depends on what‚Äôs your favorite. Group pve like raids start with warlock. Solo pve hunter. Pvp hunter or titan
---
The grind for a god roll Eyasluna continues!
---
Such as?
---
Warlocks are kind of the do it all character. Started as a titan main, but been having way more fun on my warlock lately. Hunter is really meh to me right now. Titan supers got nerfed into oblivion, but they are still very nice for melting point dps against strong bosses.
---
In your inventory under triumphs there will be the seals that details how
---
Go to LFG man
---
Thumbs up from me.

---
Hi Warlock, this is dog üê∂
---
Congrats! I misread the playing for keeps achievement as complete everything else in this seal. Prestiged once, and realized my mistake. Haven't cared to go back since, lol.
---
Sometimes even walker is hard to hit .. bcs recoil ..
---
Depends. Are you queueing up to matchmake with strangers for tier 3 reckoning?
---
It's called an Ape streak for a reason.
---
Not sure, havent done my research lol
---
[deleted]
---
Yeah not that bad. I just wish the tether itself was like d1 where it would have a slight homing arrow. Those clips are great.
---
"Bouncing around aimlessly as le Hunter"
---
I could see not using exotic WEAPONS, and depending on the class they're playing (and what exotics they have), I suppose I could see not playing with an exotic armor piece. 
---
Would I do it personally? No, probably not; but I have the majority of exotics that I'd typically want to use in a given situation; if there's not a specific piece of gear I want to wear, I just pop on Ophidian Aspect.
---
Not when it comes to sniping
---
Yeah also I wish it activated much sooner.
---
Was all about trusting your aim and Dodge reloading, so OP when used correctly
---
I was just in the exact same boat, only to make matters worse I kept trying to first bump the opposite team who inevitably would win and they‚Äôd kill me anyways
---
Lol yeah I've been playing for two days straight, I'm usually pretty ok with losing but I'm just absolutely fuming right now.
---
It wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs a nerf, the whisper is most definitely a fancy nerf sniper now, I‚Äôd call what ace is getting a minor rework. Something they should start with and then nerf it to the ground if they can‚Äôt find a balance. Bungie loves to just say fuck it from the start though and take that route most of the time unfortunately. Stay optimistic though, getting another hand cannon quest in opulence. I really think that these nerfs and changes arent just happening to decrease quality of life, we still don‚Äôt really know what exotics and their perks will be coming into the game except a slight few. Even then they‚Äôll be reworked perks for D2 compared to D1
---
Now that's a Loaded Answer!
---
Hey, this looks like a menagerie reward, and they did day you will be able to choose rewards, so hopefully the grind won't be terrible.
---
Ye, with regen on kills it lasts too long. You pop it, kill everyone, go to their spawn, kill everyone again.

Like damn it‚Äôs pve.... work together people. Makes the game way more fun for everyone!
---
The way to fix this is to only subtract points from the first person to disconnect, not from the other team members. However, if the person reconnects, that person can lose points again.
---
Everything this guy said \^ except I'm not a software dev.  Amazing app, just deleted my others and gonna use this from now on.  Also shared with my clan on discord.  Thanks so much for this!
---
As a titan main I‚Äôm ashamed to admit it but I used hunter in comp to get my recluse since it‚Äôs just so so so good in comp this season. Beware though, season of the one eyed bottom tree striker is upon us... and I couldn‚Äôt be happier üòà
---
I got two 1ks back to back with two keys in the same raid instance honestly I was mad because I already had it, I would've gladly given my rng to someone for armor so I could raise my light on my warlock lol
---
Same, F‚Äôs all around
---
Damn look at that streak, good for you man, like seriously what is your secret, if that had been me my tethers would never go off and the whole team woulda been behind that pillar lined up for a headshot on me. That is if the Titan didn't look at me the wrong way first and destroy me just by breathing on me.  Seriously I need to know, my characters are practically superman in pve but in pvp they are just balls of dough firing marshmallows at people.
---
I'm not even trying to place fault, I'm just trying to understand what the benefits would be.
---
DC shotgun is the only thing keeping me from Wayfarer.
---
This wasn't even Gambit though it was just a strike
---
When i play with ppl that have no idea what to do i simply open 1 beer and play like them .. i dont care about motes or anything i enjoy game . Instead of pulling mine hair when i know im gonna lose i just play bad for fun
---
Nerf is just a strong word like adjusting something minorly is not a nerf. It‚Äôs an adjustment. What happened to whisper is a nerf.
---
Escalation is massive amounts of majors
---
It literally talks about Truth on the Season of Opulence preview pages.
---
Yeah. I posted this when I was at work and can only look at the shiny pictures
---
r/Warlocked
---
Haha, i enjoy doing this too, revive them to 92% then stop and tbag them.
---
First ever shattered throne run I got the ship. Everyone freaked out and I was clueless
---
Yeah it's a grind all right lol, the less you have to get the harder it gets. The funny thing is I don't think you get anything  for doing it don't need it for Wayfarer. I watched a clip and they said where you make them will influence where the node will be but I have no idea what 2 I need lol
---
I'm not even sure why people want them.
---
You got kicked out of clans for being bad, so to "show them" you decided to buy a carry because you're too bad to earn it yourself... 
---
What were you planning on showing them exactly? That you're still bad but can afford to buy a weapon you didn't earn yourself? 
---
No pity for you there. Got what you deserved.
---
Feel like I played against you in comp the other day. Warlock with a bow was putting in work I was so confused when I got killed.
---
Annual Pass is content separate from Forsaken.
---
you can just buy forsaken and will have access to most content and will be able to get to the max power level, but you will be missing out on quite a lot of content
---
Yes
---
I just hope trickshots become a thing again

Doubt it
