I got a team wipe with Blade Barrage and Galanor and only got 25% back at most.
---
---
---
It's not that, it's pretty luck based and I'm was with a pretty good lfg team. None of were like pros. Probably only took an hour.
---
Drift-ception is giving a biiiig spook
---
Cool if they weren't all turds
---
Btw, you can open your inventory while loading
---
The quest did change slightly:
---
Redrix's Broadsword Quest:
---
Valor Rank Resets:
---
The Valor rank resets step will now look at previous seasons accomplishments as well.
---
Five Valor resets are still required during a single season, but this is no longer restricted to the current season. Ex: If a player had five Valor resets in Season 4, this will now grant progress towards the quest. 
---
I got sweet business, Aeon Swift, And 7 exotic sparrows of the same one, the only new one I got is ursa furiosa
---
2 from quests, 1 for free and one from Xur. Doesn’t feel very good to me?
---
Since when different game counts as "polished"?
---
I feel like they’re always set up to be like that. I was 6 points away and luckily had a bounty to turn in. All my valor resets have come down to 2 points away
---
Don't be a menace to south central  While drinking your juice in the Hood
---
Thats why i always have 1 complete bounty of gambit, just in case 
---
It would have been cheapest if you were to buy it with all the DLC. Your best bet is the Xbox store for older content line that.
---
Sounds like it. In the outskirts going towards Sojourners Camp. If you’re level 7 he’ll blink and kill you! Shoot by quickly.
---
50/50. It’s either a duplicate or it’s not. 
---
Yeah I actually just found a copy of the collection edition for $10 on bestbuy, not sure why it didn't show up when I looked earlier but it looks like I got the last copy they had
---
Polaris is actually pretty good since the scout buff. The rest are turds
---
Nice 
---
Completely fine? There are people that enjoy playing Gambit cause the gamemode is fun to play. Moreover there are people that enjoy playing it solo.
---
Hammers really isn’t a boss damaging super and I feel like EP shotty or Jotunn does more single target damage
---
People will leave Anthem and play destiny/devision and when they've played those games for 2-3 weeks they'll leave those too and play the next "big thing".
---

---
The bane of these "live service" type of games is just that the population playing each game fluctuates in accordance to the content updates.
---
If you go to the right side of the bridge there’s a rock you can jump onto the bridge from before you cross
---
You could use Cerberus 1
---
Not using auto rifles enough? Lol. Sweet business should do the trick 
---
You know I'm a good IT Security tech because I hate computers. About a year back I decided to combat gaming addiction (11-16 hours a day) by yeeting my computer and consoles. Now I have a macbook for my day to day which can't hit 60fps but is much better for security work anyway.   
---
Now I'm fully engrossed in Job at my Country's local naval base, so I'm dipping my toes back into gaming so I picked up a ps4 pro.   
---
Atleast from the above you know I'm dedicated to the grind. I'll PM you.   
---
Dont have it bro. hopefully xur will sell it in season of the drifter. 
---
I’m glad I’m not the only one who did this haha
---
I've been using Young Ahamkaras Spine for Blade Barrage, or CN for GG, Orpheus Rigs for Nightstalker in PvE, but haven't been able to decide on what to use for PvP. Got Stomp33s, Knucklehead, Foetracer, Frost33s, Ophidias spathe, and dragons shadow... Kind seem underwhelming for PvP?
---
I got dredgen last season and since then I have barely ever played gambit ever again. 32/40 and still need auto kills 
---
For those lazy it's Nessus - Watchers Grave
---
What’s the new lore? I can’t find it anywhere?
---
I didn’t say it took skill (this is arguable, but not my point). Taking nova warp would be detrimental for him.
---
Some SpaceX logos and a new public event inside the dome would be... *Ahem*... OUT OF THIS WORLD!!
---
It was posted on their [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DestinyTheGame/status/1102328504471830528) and [posted again on the official Reddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/awz5de/narrative_preview_the_murder_of_cayde6/) The twitter page has more of these as well. They're actually really cool.
---
sorry i was in the middle of a loading screen in gambit send me a friend request and ill message ya when i finish
---
Invite sent from qnie 
---
Okie dokie 
---
I'd say get 'em done, its well worth the grind, though i dont have dredgen so i cant imagine what kind of trauma you got from all the times idiots will still get up to 15 motes even though primeval was available at 3 motes, at the end of the day, you do you man!
---
Welcome to the club. I have over 14k kills on my Breakneck now.  It’s good shit. 
---
Nice
---
Fighting Lion is the bees knees
---
Hot damn. 
---
A paraplegic bee? That thing sucks
---
Omg stop it already
---
This was rumble, so basically the winner is whoever can run around and kill the bots the fastest. I played for a few hours and saw probably 20-30 of these afk bots. Bungie has a serious problem they are ignoring (PC).
---
Oh well
---
I love gambit so much. 
---
Thanks!
---
Thank you. 
---
It just takes practice. 😀
---
Sounds exactly like vanilla d2 except actually matters
---
I need a clan that can make it through s damn encoUnter withoug the words " shit my joint went out...."
---
I still think drifter is a cool character. If he did kill cayde I would side with the drifter just for a change of how the game will play in my eyes. The vanguard has gotten very boring. Maybe our quest for new power is for us to step into the darkness? Time will tell 
---
&gt; It sucks that ~~Gambit~~ any form of PVP, in any game, ever made, or ever to be made, is held back from being so much fun because of everyone just trying to use the strongest stuff to win every game.
---
Welcome to human nature. 
---
Or you land a shot on an enemy player but turns out he just tanks the shot because he popped his blade barrage
---
It’s funny cuz I’d use queensbreaker and have these crazy shots where I’d aim at the guys feet and it would hit as a headshot and be like, woah, I must have god aim on console. Now I know...
---
I used the Valakadyn for this and it shreds! It’s obviously even better as a Year 2 random roll with Rampage or Kill Clip. 
---
Spoke too soon... Season of the drifter is starting.
---
And I was worried about doing this solo.
---
Yes and it’s random, you can have 30 meatball kills and the last two drop one then the other,
---
Or you could be like a blueberry and the second meatball might just decide to give you both.
---
I wore my dead orbit shaders and rocked my vendor hung jury with pride. Arach jalaal how far you've fallen
---
I mean.. it kinda is.
---
Just need the stupid ship to drop...
---
I’m not crying ... your crying 
---
*(Flashback in D1 where I pop my golden gun and then nova bomb or titian smash one hit kill me)*
---
**YOU GET USED TO IT**
---
For DO you went into one of the lost sectors and shot the eggs or something on the wall. Was like 200 tokens p/hr or some dumb shit like that
---
It's a ton of fun with the rally baracade or lunafactions. 
---
Those words are all correct. But the punctuation and possibly the order, are all wrong.
---
do you want to come back playing on PC or returning to PS4?
---
if still have the base game on PS4, you should only buy Forsaken and try it out, see if you like it. (already comes with Curse of Osiris and Warmind)
---
if you don't have the base game, then I suggest the Legendary Edition (base game + forsaken, which already includes CoO and Warmind). 
---
you can buy the annual pass later if you're enjoying the game enough. 
---
IMO, the annual pass is worth it. The game is full of content even if you're initially playing all by yourself... and eventually you'll find people to play with you through LFG (using the companion app, or in this sub discord or the /r/DestinyTheGame one) or a clan. If you like the game, like I do, you're easily going to spend hundreds of hours shooting and looting. 
---
That’s... kinda the point
---
What and stop before you get to 6969? Or 420? Or 6942069
---
I have to go for that now the community has spoken 
---
That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying people that are locked at lvl 30 because they dont own forsaken are not allowed to play gambit. Also, the majority of forsaken playerbase is at lvl 50 because the expansion came out in September and by doing activities characters level up pretty fast. The reason I said it is because he specifically said 30.
---
Wait, what happens in two days?
---
Are pistols still the weapon of choice? I recently decided to return. Been gone a year and going to play a hunter thus time. I never liked using pistols. Hoping pulse or auto rifles are competitive now. 
---
Be glad that you got the experience in, lots of people are gonna be rusty when going for gambit prime at launch.
---
The March 5th update which, among a ton of other things, is going to bring a nerf to linear fusion rifles and Queenbreaker's aim assist in particular. 
---
Here is and imgur link for them:
---
[https://imgur.com/a/C2q0vNO](https://imgur.com/a/C2q0vNO)
---
I dont really believe that people really skip the the campaign and go straight into gambit because of the light level disadvantage in the pvp part of gambit.
---
It kinda makes sense since Savathun's Song was here as well. When i saw TLW trailer, i always assumed the weapons of sorrow are found on Titan too.
---
Ohhhh good point! I thought Mindbender was Savathun, my B. I dunno, I still think Savathun is behind it though, somehow playing other people to get ahead, now I just have nothing to back it up
---
I so read that in the professors voice 
---
Malf with the bone shader is so good.
---
Looks fantastic
---
Level 2 solstice cloak doesn't have scales. 
---
This is the same shit I got when I was grinding for Luna.
---
He is wearing them
---
Playin high stakes i see, i too like to live dangerously 
---
It's basically what you use if you can't get a good roll on hammerhead. I've used this weapon myself and taken out whole teams with it numerous times. Unless someone on the other team is using Queens breaker or crooked fang then they don't stand much of a chance if I get the drop on them
---
Green = “Screw it, might as well grab a fuggin blue sword considering how much heavy I *won’t* get”
---
White = “Turning around at 19 motes is for quitters, and all of you are being reported if I don’t get Protect the Runner every.single.match”
---
Yellow = “Let me show you what this Malf do”
---
Red = *Red, the Primevil is at a third of its health, we’re tied with the enemies, three of them are already dead, can you please DPS and not leave us alo-* “Muted and reported, now where did I leave my Sleeper? Oh yeah, near those three Small Blockers and a cliff”
---
31th march according to Bungie Store.
---
I called it totally. Yall were really expecting EA to publish a good game. Yeah right yall can stick to hope I'd rather have my instinct and research to know when a game is decent enough to even buy.
---
If it makes you feel better Im gonna get the invader armor and I only ever invade with a sniper
---
You do need access to the tower so yeah gotta finish the story. Probably also forsaken storyline.
---
I wish I could just take a day and blow through all of them,I’m lucky if I get 1 done
---
I’m still missing pillager lol, I’m so done 
---
They changed the date to August 31st for all seals, including dredgen. But if you already redeemed your code, you have until April 30 to get it.
---
Obtained from the TWAB on February 28
---
I was well aware when posting this what the results would be, trust me
---
cant wait to get my reskined set just now with some sparkles on top!
---
They changed the date to August 31 in the TWAB
---
That is the wrongest thing I've seen all day
---
If savathun is behind Dregden yor, I think the pieces would fall together nicely.
---
What’s the gun above the last word
---
Congrats sadly the cheese might not work after the update but theres still hope 
---
Fix your bugs...
---
So they need to update the store. Good for OP. More time to get that title.
---
Got mine this morning, still haven't tried it out because I'm so done with the game after the hard gambit slog I've been on for the past 2 days, lol 
---
Wait a minute what happened lorewise that I missed? Who’s Aunor?
---
Yes it's worth it. With Forsaken you also get all the previous expansions so there is a lot of new content to go through.
---
If your super tight on money take care of yourself first and i do recommend Forsaken I absolutely loved it 
---
Rip
---
If you haven’t played it past the base game then your missing out on a lot and are a bit behind but if you wanted to jump in they have stuff for you to catch up pretty fast to majority of people other than that’s its worth but only if you like grindy games
---
They generally don’t have time limits unless you’re going for score, so as long as you take it slow and careful, you should be fine.
---
Thank you!
---
Will do sir!
---
jotunn meta? seems like someone doesnt know how to move, it sucks absolute balls if you face againts someone who knows how it works
---
I had the same problem with the same gun it was the only thing keeping me from dredgen
---
You...
---
...You weren’t already?
---
We really need to have a talk about your thing with trusting anyone who pays you a compliment. 
---
I love one particular review with the title:
---
Anthem PC Review: Better Than Destiny In Every Way… Except One
---
hey please let me know if you want more of these I got a few laying around
---
“More”
---
Just hop back in and get your grind on man. You’re behind for sure but there is so much stuff to do that it won’t matter and they made leveling up a lot easier so you should catch up fairly quick. 
---
I bet we won’t be getting any new vanguard armour anyways so
---
I have everything from eververse this season except 1 ship its kind of annoying 
---
People ask about using it. They arent saying hey I'm going to use it to jump into gambit. It takes a couple of hours to go from 30 to 50. That wasn't my point anyways he specifically said level 30. You are just playing devils advocate. I played at least 25 gambit matches this weekend because of triple infamy and matched up with 0 people that were under level 50. 
---
That's really cool, but D&amp;D is not much of a story based game so unless every one in your group plays D&amp;D normally and loves destiny, you might want to use a different rule set like dungeon world, or burning wheel.
---
P.s. this is mainly for other people looking to do a similar thing.
---
Oof
---
He might be using a web site that only shows the perks that dont have a random roles
---
Use the time tool when you google search and that will help a lot. Just set it to past month or year and you’ll normally find a more up to date resource.
---
Ah, yes, let me intentionally handicap myself and how efficient I can be so I can debilitate the team's ability to win
---
Yes you are what? 
---
Play like a bitch... That's how I got past that step. Equip a scout rifle and sit way far away from the action. Really good if you're playing control. Get a couple shots on someone and hope your teammate kills them. Me not good at PVP. 
---
oh some one asked if I was using hard light and I told them yes
---
yes
---
Still don’t understand. We saw what happened. We know what happened.
---
The cheese will 100% still work. There are multiple guns that can still cheese it that arent rockets, rat king, thunderlord, prospector, moutaintop among others. And they really arent nerfing clusterbombs. They are just putting the damage taken away from the cluster into the initial rocket. 
---
Weird, I have the exact opposite opinion on D&amp;D. I think it's really good for story based games. 
---
And I got 3 breaknecks for all 3 characters via that bounty. 
---
I feel like not playing destiny 2 anymore
---
Welcome to spectar armor v2.
---
Right, op cleared that up already
---
Guess you suck ass then, it's getting nerfed queenfaggot
---
I dont think it's supposed to be only one mote collector. Just that if you chose the armor, you should play the role, as you would benefit the team most for doing so. But any other player can and should still collect and bank motes. But when the portal to invade opens, I expect the invader to go through, not the sentry, reaper, or collector. 
---
What I worried more about is queuing into teams that have 2 to 3 invaders, and they all just play to try and and invade. 
---
I want to be able to carry more stuff on my character 
---
you barley see those supers, its all just fist of havoc and hammer of sol titans skating around with OEM
---
### REPORT MESSAGE
---
### HARASSMENT
---
I wonder if Ada joins you because of the stuff you did for her.
---
Gambit prime adds raid like mechanics to damage a boss,so it will be harder to start it up and the boss might have immunity phases (like second encounter of last wish) or have a time window TO damage it (like third encounter of last wish)
---
May you have bountiful luck in the upcoming season :)
---
Ah I see what you mean. I guess we'll find out I hope you're right lol
---
MoreConsole does a nice [breakdown](https://youtu.be/kiZYF3DpmKo?t=195) of it
---
So do i,maybe then the meta will stop being triple warlock/nighthawk + orpheus/melting point
---
titan
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
F for that score, F for that screen shot, the sad part is your on PC...
---
Just wait until you get quest steps that require heroic public completions. I spent probably 10 hours waiting for one that someone would not fuck up with “I haz dps lollol” style in tangled shore. 
---
I disticntly remeber a moment in open banner on the cabal map where you're on the ship flying. We got a power play and we're on the hunt. We corner their team in their spawn with supers slaying each guy one at a time. In the corner of my eye I see the second to last target. His last remaining teammate gets hit by a arc staff before 4 of my own teammates close in for the kill. We a watched the guy jump off the map and floof to his death (he was a warlock) it was one of the funniest things we've seems as he started up at us as he fell to his death.  
---
Thank you, may RNG bless us all
---
I love it. I really like invading. I don't use queenbreaker but still something thats honestly almost as bad, hammerhead. But I also get a fair amount of kills with Vouchsafe which isn't as bad since it's just a regular scout rifle.
---
Yeah practically just ornaments. But the more variations of armour, the better. 
---
Laughs in actually being able to snipe without wasting an exotic slot.
---
Midnight Talon &gt; Meyrin
---
Have you checked what the error does? 
---
I did stop playing destiny. I admittedly haven’t sunk that time into anything else though. Anthem isn’t floating my boat. 
---
It is what the title is man, saving for new mods next season. Why would I waste 500 mod components on 50 resilience mods?
---
\&gt; Give us the tools, and let us figure out what to do with them.
---
That's literally what they're doing.
---
Thats why you balance your games so it doesnt turn in clownfiesta.
---
This is amazing guardian!
---
For real the face is shaded beautifully, and then you have this white pencil (pastel?) for the hair just really makes it pop.
---
I like your style :)
---
Why wardcliff and not anarchy?
---
Is banned for life the best approach for exploiting the game?
---
Cries in shitty kinetic sniper rolls T.T
---
What does passing it do?
---
My death count was 94 before I passed that mission. My housemate called into me at 3am to see if I was alright.
---
Cause I haven’t finished the raid yet, let alone get anarchy :(
---
Does anyone have a code they're not going to use? Haven't been in since my son was born?! 
---
Yes they are. At 612 you are 72 levels higher than the AI. You'll be fine
---
As far as games go it's pretty good imo, that said I still haven't gotten Tartara's Gaze because of the bug earlier which got me on 2 characters and Ada hasn't sold it since 😔.
---
its not that funny tbh
---
Energy snipes with a kinetic for add slaying works pretty well.
---
Well, they changed it so that you can still get a damage bonus without having to use void anything, but you do get a bigger damage increase if it is void.
---
Jesus christ you are angry. 
---
just a heads up: the meatball will only have a chance of dropping the cosmetics on a character that you have acquired malfeasance on. if you kill it on a character that hasn't done that, you will just get the quest item again.
---
Tbf i have a good tataras gaze roll. Just rather use lunas in that spot for when i get pushed as an invader
---
Cross mapping with sleeper and using your own super to shut theirs down 
---
The armories were closed when Cayde died.
---
I got a few of mine with top tree striker and top tree hammers. 
---
im at 40 and im still not a dredgen yet
---
What about the long Shadow? That's a great rifle
---
Remember to link up!
---
We didn't ask to be immortal we just got brought back from dead &amp; told go shoot stuff &amp; protect people we don't know. Being immortal sucks you just die over and over each time more painful than the last. Surprised our guardian hasn't gone mad with insanity.  
---
Not a big risk at all because Vanguard prevents us from finding out about our past lives.  
---
Only difference is we're trained to kill Gods &amp; Guardians. We know a lot of tricks from the crucible &amp; iron banner to best Shin a greenhorn whose mad his foster pops got killed by one man. I get killing all the other corrupted guardians but killing none corrupted guardians that just wanna research how Dredgen got corrupted &amp; learn from his mistakes to make us stronger &amp; help humanity is just plain stupid to me.  
---
I miss my 3 eyed Hunter babe also I just wanna hear her voice just one more time
---
the guy who discovered it was on console... you are not worlds first, please fact check before you post.
---
You can get a sniper from across the map with Jötunn if he isn't looking at you. It also kills enemies with their super active pretty easily. In any case you can almost hear them swearing when it hits. Same goes for when you dodge it multiple times with simple sidestepping.
---
Well our ghost does reference the fact its a very powerful sniper capable of killing a ghost and doesnt really suspect any foul play
---
It's still more fun than "collect 300 spinfoil" 
---
Are the goblins gonna shield eachother? QQ
---
Also Ada killed a guardian and his ghost with her sniper rifle
---
I still never got Jotunn to drop for me.
---
General Kenobi! 
---
Yeah I feel these three have not been fleshed out do much.
---
At least Anthem foxes them xd
---
Guitar for 6 months lol
---
Losing is 26 pts, winning starts at 30 pts and goes up each win of a streak. I cant remember exactly but its something like 30, 40, 50, 60, 70...very rough estimate, I'm only sure about the losing 26 and winning 30 and like 70 for a 5 streak 
---
Doesn't work even half the time, but I love doing that sort of "I'm open!" dance and seeing the cogs turn until they work it out.
---
Before forsaken it was 33% but just die primary weapons and abilitys, i dont know if they changed something about that
---
Once I had malfeasance done I got the sparrow on my 2nd meatball kill and then the ship on my 3rd kill 
---
Perhaps it wouldn't be considered as our Ghost is ultimately on our side. Perhaps there's no way to know if our Ghost edited the footage to hide our (supposed) crime?
---
Yeah... that, or maybe I just don’t like the game mode... ohh Dredgen
---
 I need to do a lot too! :(
---
Am I the only one who invades with a primary...?
---
You’re Doing the Travellers work Friend. 
---
B
---
I understand but it's not worth it
---
thank you!
---
“Insinuating”
---
I'm actually really loving Anthem...it's just by no means a Destiny killer lol
---
Congrats it reallly is fun to use, best auto imo
---
Ah. I play on PC. Aiming vertically in addition to horizontally must be too much for most people with controllers :/
---
I randomly found this post and thought "hey is that ains" and yup
---
You use a Tractor Cannon which buffs the energy damage (void gets best buff) and then If ya got some nova bombs going it's a RIP
---
Have the last word, and I think I have the pinnacle quests, just not close to completing them.
---
I’d like to do the Breakneck, but I need 97 double kills still..
---
^^
---
Hello, ITS_SCOT_FREE! I am afraid I cannot let you get away here! theeharryone1694 was handing out free scotches, my good Redditor! Have a nice day!
---
It does all sources but void is like 50% more while arc and solar are like 33% more.
---
According to the roadmap it is tommorow 
---
https://i.imgur.com/kxFkoia.jpg
---
Still, there aren't any flashy armor ornaments/sets. Maybe if you look closely you can tell the difference between Exotics and Blue armors, but you don't see a 650 player from afar and say "woah that dude looks insane".
---
Now with the Gambit Prime armors things may be different, which is awesome, but until now end-game armors aren't that nice.
---
Alright that’s it, I’m calling Roboute Guilliman and the Imperial Inquisition...
---
people forget that. It was successful for a bout a month after launch.
---
Progress will be kept, no need to rush to finish it
---
Have you even read the lores they dropped though? How the fuck is Saint-14 gonna be involved in killing Cayde when he died forever ago 
---
N I C E
---
Wait. That's illegal !
---
We are the 'Hero of the red war' so they are talking about us..
---
Then pull Nolanbot footage, same same but different.
---
U talking about the season pass??? 
---
parcel of stardust with outlaw opening shot and smooth bore
---
Need better pants and equip the lower tier solstice ornament 
---
On launch, guitar wasn't a problem until a year later
---
Nah, If it was the Drifter then fuck the Vanguard for suspecting it was us. If it wasn't the drifter, then still fuck the Vanguard for suspecting it was us.
---
TL;DR: Fuck the Vanguard.
---
thanks man
---
Yeah, the gameplay is fun, but it has less content than vanilla Destiny 2, less interesting loot to chase, and some really questionable design choices that even Bungo would be confused by. I hope it gets improved, but I'm not sure how much it actually will be since EA won't sink more money into something they think has failed. 
---
This makes me wonder, do Guardians fuck?
---
The funny thing is, if a game does eventually come out that DOES kill destiny, the same people who have predicted it for the last how many years will still claim "they called it"
---
Same, sitting here with a freaking GTX970 and a i5 4690 and the game juste takes 100% of the proc and often crash. Refunded it for this reason and the many other bugs, ux problems, story and chars bland af, no cosmetics and stuff... I played it for like 15 hours but I couldn't blind myself anymore
---
🎶 Life is a transmat I wanna fire it all night long 🎶
---
I sense new memes. I will need to check the archives if its complete
---
Apparently there have been several cases where the game crashes and then bricks your console. PS4 tech support isn’t doing anything about it either. 
---
All editions of forsaken include Curse of osiris, warmind and forsaken content, meanwhile the season pass includes extra content, if you dont fully understand I would recommend looking at the Destiny 2 road map, it will outline everything you will be getting (minus some events that have already gone by)
---
Got hit by one yesterday, poured some salt won't lie.
---
Plot twist: **after the dlc where every single player decided to go with the drifter he'll say that he was in business with the Barons.
---
Mark my words!
---
Yup. Which is a much easier grind given that you only can do the set forges. When working on my stuff I got god rolls of Tatara's Gaze (Snapshot/Kill Clip/3 bullet mag), Hammerhead (Feeding Frenzy/Rampage/Extended Mag), Blast Furnace (Feeding Frenzy/Kill Clip/Flared Magwell), and Stryker's(Tireless Blade/Surrounded) . I also got the curated Kindled Orchid(Kill Clip/Rampage/Drop Mag). I have a decent Snapshot/Rampage Spiteful Fang. 
---
The only gun I don't have a good roll on is the Ringing Nail. I am gonna keep running it whenever it's in the shop to get the curated one just so I'm done with it. I've also got all the curated rolls from Scourge, but sadly still don't have the No Feelings with box breathing. 
---
So when i buy the cheapest version ill still get osiris and warmind?
---
Destiny was made 5 years ago and now even in D2 we still get contacting Destiny servers and Baboon and Weasel error codes that send you to the main menu. No big deal right? Anthem has been out 2 weeks they have already attempted 2 patches. Bungie schedules patches like they're DLC. Except for error codes. Apparently they've been trying to fix that one for 5 years.
---
I haven't played Destiny in a month and it has nothing to do with Anthem. For me it killed itself without any outside help. After Forsaken its been...meh. Doesn't it seem like Season of the Forge, Drifter and whatever's in June could have been one DLC release, based on content? 
---
I’m not your buddy, pal. 
---
Fuck Cayde Drifter is an OG badass that designed the Malf
---
Facts
---
Hanging onto completed bounties apparently will only drop 650 max LL items. It will not drop anything higher than that due to one of the last patches 
---
Whatever heavy you like to use that can take down a fallen walker.
---
That is correct
---
D2 was dog shit until Forsaken. Period. And yes, I’m actually a destiny lover and player with 3 650 characters, and I’ll continue to do my part of keeping Destiny alive. It’s perfectly ok to be a fan and a supporter of a game but stop being blind of the obvious truth and talking shit and acting like the game was fantastic when you and everyone else knows it wasn’t, it makes you look like an idiot. Guess what, did you know it’s perfectly ok to play BOTH GAMES IF YOU WANT!?! Yes, I speak the truth!! ....... Smh.. Dorks. 😒
---
Riskrunner gang REPRESENT
---
Anthem crashes  ALOT but destiny has been dead for me since the black armoury. So much grinding just to get into the BA stuff that I just didn’t have the time for it 😞
---
I do ok invading with go figure. I only use it when I don't have machine gun ammo though. It's a solid option if you want to use a different heavy, like tractor cannon or something for primeval melting 
---
Hate on RNG....I actually got them all and duplicates in one afternoon. No fireteam medallions or anything...RNG is a pretty Bitch dress in tight red!!! 
---
How is the Mountaintop anyways, never seen anyone use it yet
---
I didn’t think it would but I was sad that last night around 10pm central I went to do tier 2 or higher of spire and was all alone in the dreaming city. 
---
I just read their twitter but thanks. So kind 
---
Thank you very much! :)
---
Nice...I'm at 63
---
Destiny doesn't need help in its demise. Its seems to be doing fine killing itself.
---
And Cayde designed Ace is Spades... 
---
Keep it going, the ship is nice 😊
---
Sentry actually sounds really fun. Pro tip, use a kinetic shotgun because they do 10% more per pellet IIRC. something like parcel of stardust was great.
---
&gt; or you needed to get lucky for 1000 voices to drop in order to get the title?
---
You do.
---
Ouch.
---
*cries in weak knives*
---
Glad cayde died.
---
Well it's not like Anthem patches solved anything. It's known that the day one patch actually decreased drastically (we're talking about 10 to 20 fps) performances, and we got a 5go patch two days after the launch with no patch note to this day, and which personally made the game unplayable. 
---
Destiny and Bungie can probably be blamed, I wouldn't know haven't played in months but Anthem is really looking bad to this day. 
---
Oh not competitive. Quick play, or whichever the 6v6 mode is in rotation. If you can put it off, wait until “mayhem” is up. I heard it was pretty simple to do then, what with your super being up so much. 
---
Why you reporting them anyways. did they beat you?
---
I am glad :3
---
Thank you ^^
---
Drifter is a Reptillian.
---
wtf Sturm is fun af when you pair it w certain weapons; it can be very good.
---
You can get 999999 on calus (gg) and shattered throne (final boss, with sleeper stimulant) and riven  (gg)
---
Ah, three of coins. I remember farming the shit out of Winter's Kell back when it had a crazy exotic drop rate.
---
Baby numbers.
---
I mean lack of PvP is a HUGE reason why it won't/isn't a Destiny killer.  But yeah, aside from revenue, they'll still have solid player bases, unless you get completely dicked over like Battleborn did with Overwatch
---
I thought the tether increases void damage to affected enemies?
---
We'll see what will happen soon. But my guess is just like you stated. Your Guardian will somehow be more and more corrupted by the drifter. With no choice but to be drifters helping Hand!
---
&gt;Oh okay
---
 from here I could hear how your heart was breaking 
---
Alright alright alright. Let's see what we've got. NEWCOMER ON THE HORIZON. 
---
Yeah played anthem til the endgame and running a 30 minute stronghold that’s like a harder destiny strike and only getting one masterwork is terrible
---
Yandere Riven Mara Sov &gt; Resting Bitch real Mara Sov. Don't @ me.

Can't wait to put a big Thorn bullet in his ghost and then his ghost.

Fell asleep and hit delete key/button whilst on character selection screen?

U rite, buts REALLY apparent for this game in this sub if you look around
---
Stylish new armor. 
---
lol, no... she's the second big bad.  There is a third sister out there.... somewhere.
---
Man I know right
---
Drop mag is pretty important on that roll as well. Mine doesnt have it and its basically a reset every mag. 
---
It’s pretty dirty, I didn’t think it’d be good in gambit until I forgot to change my heavy one time 😂😂
---
All video games get cheaper over time. If I were you, I would wait for the annual pass to go on sale and then buy it. In the time it takes you to play through the annual pass stuff, Sekiro might be approaching the time of its first sale.

Apprech the honesty, fam.

It looks like you do too Mr. Huckleberry.

Loooool! I'm 100% on the bad guy train.
---
Dare I say...this is GOLD! 
---
This is the eververse set. They will come from bright engrams and certain pieces in the bright dust weekly rotation.
---
These are one-time-only campaign end rewards. Are you thinking of how powerful gear bounties completed before Tuesday will only give loot up to 650? 
---

---
The only way to avoid spending $40 on Forsaken is to wait for Forsaken to go on sale. 
---
The annual pass (Black Armory, Season of the Drifter, and the upcoming Penumbra) is all end game only, so you do not need it until you have exhausted activities in Forsaken. It is cheaper to buy the Forsaken + Annual Pass bundle, though only by a little bit. 
---
Grats and enjoy! Till u realize Ringing Nail with Rampage + Dragonfly can clear a whole room faster than you can say boom! Hehe...
---
PS. Was loving Breakneck till I got a good Bygones and Blast Furnance. One each for my Titan &amp; Warlock. Now it's collecting dust on my inventory. Still not in my vault yet.
---
TRUUUUE
---
pretend to be Mcree with The Last Word.
---
I was using thunder Lord and Blast furnace.
---
Hmm interesting. Guess I'll so it then. Thanks
---
Good job dude
---
Idk man I genuinely think that the Titan vanguard is a pussy and ikora is a anxty teenager writing sad poems in journal all day they are both bullshit character and I'm tired of the vanguard in activity zavalah needs to be removed as vanguard leader and we need someone new
---
thats what i was hoping for. 
---
Gambit Prime armors...they give you benefits according to your role in Gambit...or just Prime...dunno yet until the update drops tomorrow. 
---
I mean we do deal less damage. Our light is decreased, and our weapons lose all their perks.
---
Deflector. How's that? 😂
---
I dont really care about the items or other things, They all give a ghost of some sort, A ship and somethin else but I mainly wanna know about the bright engrams. I dont think they would be season locked
---

I've been looking for $20 deals for forsaken but I always seem to miss those.

It's a race to see who will give me the sickest exotic first. They will have my allegiance.

The new gambit sounds pretty cool. That armor set is super dope looking

Sorry I dont really get cha. New rewards? I thought these could only be got once per char And I dont really intend to reset for more, I could be 100% wrong tho.
---
the most important thing I saw in this clip was banking 2 motes to summon Primeval.  The rest is just fun, and explains a lot about some of my recent solo matches.
---
In the Lore it says that Shaxx is helping the Drifter with his Gambit 
---
So I guess Shaxx is still on my side then 
---
If it's locked behind the annual pass than nope that won't be me. 😐
---
Where as you need the sniper, I need the damn ship from meatball
---
Solid combo honestly. Blast Furnace is great for invading when there's no heavy. 
---
ITS A LINE FROM CARS 
---
After someone posted a video I remembered the line and got the joke after 8 years. I truly admit my mistake 
---
Do you want to use my Cleansing Knife to do that? For sanitary purposes...
---
Very insightful and helpful. Personally what is your go to loadout in pve currently ?
---
r/kachow
---
Either rumble, or quickplay. For me it seemed like qp was the fastest option since assists counts towards that same step.
---
The eyes have dabs of *glow in the dark* paint.
---
Isnt drifter lightless? My bets on zavala fuck that
---
Nah, not with that nice new Malfeasance ornament coming out.
---
Like the double axe cabal in volundr forge. I have 2 hit them with jotunn. I could 2 hit them with my trench barrel rapid fire and be done in the fraction of the time. 
---
Ok so after asking around, it turns out that the dreaming city lore is a random drop from patrols, lost sectors, nd mostly blind well, so just do those and u should get some, the only lore thats time gated rn is truth to power,  most people already finished dreaming city
---
Maybe its a silly question but when will  the power bounties from the rifter be available? is it from tomorrow on? should i finish the campaign? im lvl 50 and power 525
---
I use the first part of pyrric victory to throw up the flares like I'm going 'over here!'

It actually works quite well.

its hard to miss but the eververse logo is in the background of the picture

You don't attack roll for a magic missile
---
And I don't even have TLW yet. (Too lazy to do Lost Sectors)
---
With sleeper stimulant?
---
No, it may break it, those are just glamour items anyway.  3 of them have already gone through multiple resets as well and their offer has not changed.  You can test it by turning in the red war, as that was vanilla d2.
---
If Ikora can go out in the field again then I’m choosing Vanguard. If Drifter makes one pop culture reference I’m siding with Vanguard. If Drifter has cool shaders I’m siding with Drifter. If Vanguard send me on a quest that even resembles the “Taken War” quests I’m siding with Drifter.
---
Ima kchow the heck out of the enemy team as invader
---
Thanks for the tip! 
---
good sfm
---
Goddammit alright, who shot the eyes?
---
Can I still dream of Hawkmoon for D2Y3?  I really miss my Hawkmoon.
---
Yes those are the augmented frames &amp; they DON'T count towards your 100 frame completions.
---
Only powerful weapon frames &amp; the corresponding non-powerful weapon frames that you purchase from Ada with modulus reports count towards your 100 frame completions.
---
Imo the game doesn't explain it at all. Earlier in the game you get to throw relics to destroy shit (mars) but that's solo and there's no charge mechanic. There's no charged relic mechanic anywhere in overworld Dreaming City either.
---
Fuck 60% of the time I get The Corrupted on the Vanguard playlist people don't even know how to use the relics to break the shields on those first centurions, they just shoot at them while their screen tells em "Immune!" and they just shrug their shoulders figuring someone else knows how it works.
---
I'm starting to feel like I'm the only one who loves *The Last Dance*
---
You're still missing the angling rod "alone as a cod" 
---
Nahw don't worry, it's just gonna be in the loot pool. She's gonna sell a piece per week and on top of that you'll be able to get random drops from bright engrams. I'm sure it'll be fine.
---
A good Crooked fang or Rocket launcher works just fine. You should also have a machine gun at this point from the first forge. The boss is bt far the easiest one...hell you can get by just saving your ult if your class has a good one.
---
I save the exotic for something that can kill super elites faster.
---
Stellar movie

The auto rifle from the Last Wish raid is the one I used. After one day of gambit, i'm already halfway through.

I bodied this guy with izanagi and was promptly told that I was the reincarnation of Hitler

I'm not 100% but did you just refer to Shin Malphur, the original OG Golden Gun Hunter as a Greenhorn?
---
I have the same thing. I just dont use auto rifles. It's either HCs or Pulse rifles for primary and ikelos for secondary
---
KERCHEW

Yes it is, yet, should it be unplayable (I'm not talking about 30 FPS, I'm talking about losing controls half the time because of 100% CPU usage and crashes because of that) on the lowest settings possible?

Hunt Down the Freeman memes??? 
---
You have 3 options.
---
1:Buy forsaken. It is normally 40$. All you need before hand is vanilla game. All forsaken purchases automatically come with Curse of Osiris and Warmind if you do not have them already.
---
2: Buy forsaken and the annual pass bundle. This should be around 70$ total(40 for forsaken, 30 for annual pass.
---
3. In the unlikely event you do not have the base game, you would probably buy the 60$ complete collection or whatever.
---
Prices may be different as there have been sales recently. 
---
Any questions?
---
No one ever said that it will kill Destiny.
---
Harder
---
The quest is only there to tell people it exists. It used to only be available on weekends, but now it is available 24/7 from any public event in the proper area. 
---
It is a highly involved quest that will probably take you many tries to successfully complete. 
---
What?
---
It's a reference.
---
Im still torn, gonna wait to see what the game brings us story wise befire i make the decision i think! 
---
Cake day best wishes! 
---
I thought we got one with Black Armory? 
---
Hi
---
Why, they take no time at all, you can easily beat the both in 5-7 mins 
---
i agree on that point. i got rid of it after 2 months of playing, i kept telling myself, it'll get better, it'll get better... In my opinion it never did. but that being said i do think The Division is more like destiny than Anthem is. (also a usual pc player here but ive been forced to play on console because i cant afford to get a new pc, my old one runs old games fine but it finally hit the wall and cant run much anymore.)
---
Because he was killing then while they were trying to! 133% of Primeval health healed. He was absolutely invading a lot during the Primeval phase.
---
Go to IO, and wait for a PE to start at Lost Oasis. When it does, a boss spawns in one of three locations. Ignore the event and find the boss. He’s either above the lost sector in a cave, across from the lost sector between the rocks or to the right of the spawn location where the taken event starts in a cave. Kill the boss and the portal will be up
---
No
---
I thought that we would see more of Osiris after CoO, only for him disappear and create more problems for us to handle
---
Public events are my favourite too! Don't feel like you need to rush, but completing the campaign does unlock a lot more conveniences and stuff to do. 
---
Also, if you have not already observed it, public events each have a secret objective that turns them in to heroic public events. [Here is an infographic with a brief text description for all public events](https://www.niris.tv/blog/hpe). You can find lots of guides with both pictures and video if this is not clear. Some, such as the injection rig, are kind of hard to understand without a visual guide.

He’s so good at the raid he’s doing all three callouts

*Warmind flashbacks intensify*
---
**BWAAAAAAAAAAH**
---
I’m pretty sure the real one is still out there
---
Wonder how long they’re gonna try to drag out the content before they give us those quests
---
It had its own issues though is my point. Everyone compares anthem to some game that’s been out for years. I’m just as frustrated but I’ve been waiting for this game and I feel it’s reasonable to give it some time to get fixed. I say that while also holding the opinion that if I pay 60 bucks for a game I expect it to be finished, but that’s not the norm anymore.
---
Look up the YouTube: My name is byf. 
---
He does a ton of lore vids and they're exceptional. 
---
There is a website called Ishtar Collective that has all D1 and D2 lore. It isn't very easy to use if you just want to browse, unfortunately. You kind of have to look for specific topics and then read. 
---
Oh okay, thanks!
---
When you try to make memes, but you don’t have editing software.
---
Sparrow is from Scourge
---
thanks!
---
Yeah but that can be done fast 0-50 is way faster than 400 to 650
---
The game has a seriously IQ issue with the majority of the player base. Unless it's run, jump, shoot the general player base doesn't have a clue. I made a huge thread about it, but one of the mods, who got butt hurt once it was found out he was one of the problem players, deleted it because it was "being too mean".
---
Does this color make me look fat (with strength)?
---
The fact that you can walk over your corpse to get the motes you "lost" is huge.
---
Can someone explain why he's being down voted for not having the annual pass? Asking for a friend
---
Sparrow is from a secret chest in Scourge
---
One thing to keep in mind is that Destiny is a different type of shooter than the other games you play. It is a “looter shooter”. Therefore, not everyone starts in pvp on a level playing field. You may have the same dust rock blues shotgun that another guy has, but because he happens to have better perks, his may 1 shot from a farther distance.
---
1. If you don’t like the old armor/weapons from before Forsaken, dismantled them for gunsmith materials. You can use these for infusing or turning into the gunsmith for possibly some good weapons. Some of the old weapons already had good perks so you may like them still.
---
2. There is no killcam in destiny. I didn’t like this at first but it doesn’t bother me anymore.
---
3. When it comes to hand cannons, the shots to kill rely heavily on headshots as well as the archetype. For example 140rpm and 150rpm can kill in 3 headshots. This makes the time to kill slightly faster in the 150rpm but I believe they are less forgiving if you hit body shots (someone can give the actual numbers since I can’t remember them atm). 180rpms have much lower range than the rest of hand cannons and can’t kill in less than 4 shots (excluding Luna’s howl and not forgotten).
---
4. Some perks allow regen to happen very quickly such as on the one eyed mask or devour ability. However, increasing recovery (as opposed to mobility/resilience) is the best way to get health back quickly. Warlocks have the advantage here because it’s easy for them to get high recovery. Hunters get mobility and titans get resilience. 
---
5. Some abilities such as a shoulder charge from a titan can 1 shot. Others must be buffed somehow to one shot such as the titan hammer. Normally though, they are not 1 punching you. You may happen to get shot right before being punched.
---
6. Stuff? If you mean armor and weapon perks, then yeah.
---
7. To me a guardians “shield” doesn’t affect much. It’s basically just a portion of your overall health.
---
8. There is skill based matchmaking in gambit. Gambit can be difficult to win if you are playing solo against a team because many solos still don’t know the best strategies.
---
9. Matchmaking is only connection based in crucible except for competitive. In that mode, matchmaking is based on your glory rank.
---
10. Yes, as you look at the end scoreboard, you can hold y (on Xbox, another button on pc I’m sure) to return to orbit. Otherwise you can back out if quick when you are back in orbit before the next match connects.
---
11. Farming for good perks/weapons is pretty essential. It does not guarantee you will like the PvP better
---
Oh okay. I just did the last word quest and when you turn it in it says something about drifters lightless eyes
---
Yep, literally the only Titan exotic I am missing. 
---
I wouldn't mind AS long AS i can play pve the way i want.
---
And you can't report once you get full matchmaking for the new game
---
You may have better luck in /r/fireteams, /r/fireteamsPS4, or the official D2 phone app. 
---
Cries in Parkinson’s level aiming 
---
Let's be honest, they don't want you reporting. You get banned for supplying them with proof, even.
---
^sorry.
---
It depends.
---
For your first character; sure. But alt chars can be boosted to ~630 without even doing bounties already.
---
If you want to keep the gun going to the shader can be made easier.  Make sure you have the thing from Ada-1 that drops armor when you forge a gun, the armor can have the forge shader doubling your shot every run
---
The let down from anthem reviews pushed me to give forsaken a chance.... and I do not regret it at all.
---
I'm Pro Vanguard all the way only reason I'll side with drifter on my 3rd is to see the story other than that he can go sit on a fat one till it turtle peaks out his mouth 
---
Looks correct. The following site is the one I use for all the wishes. 
---
https://idleanimation.com/last-wish-plates
---
It is just a visual and audio effect on headshot kills but it’s very identifiable when it is working. It will only be active until you go back to orbit so you lose it if the team leaves and comes back or gets erorred out. 
---
Outside of that, not sure what the issue would be. 
---
Get ready for 400 thousand Invaders and like 5 reapers.
---
Okay, thank you!
---
1) some old items are quite good, but eventually, as you get new gear, you’ll probably dismantle it.
---
2)Nope
---
3)Most hand cannons require 3 headshots to kill (or 2 in some cases). If it’s taking more shots it’s due to you hitting body shots.
---
4) Health regen changes depending on your equipped armour. There are also several exotics that allow for very quick health  regen.
---
5) Certain melees and grenades can be charged to deal more damage, which is usually an insta kill (depending on your resilience)
---
6) Gear and armoury is everything. Also equip an exotic of you can and make sure you have good rolls on all.
---
7) I assume you mean the Titan shield. Depending on which you use, it’s quick useful to hold a choke point or area, eg in control in crucible.
---
8) There is matchmaking, the rest is just skill and luck with having good teammates.
---
9) Almost every activity that you have to load into (other than raids and nightfalls) have automatic matchmaking). This includes every crucible mode (though I guess private matches are an exception?)
---
10) If you are queuing, press circle (PS)or B (Xbox). If you are at the end of a game, hold triangle (PS) or Y (Xbox).
---
11) Farming will hopefully get you better gear and weapons with betters rolls.
---
This is why the whole "roles" in Gambit Prime won't work
---
Same
---
agreed, I hated d2 at release.. things have changed
---
People on this sub don't like bringing up the less than good at all monetization of D2. They are so sensitive to it it is beyond logical discourse.
---
3. Ghosts are being killed in Gambit Prime testing
---
You play on blizzard i assume? Someone may have stolen your account info through an in-game purchase. they could use it to remove anything. that has happened to many players. This sucks though. F
---
That happens, its very rare tho
---
I'm excited to play a Sentry Warlock. Gonna mess up some Taken.
---
They are just so long. 
---
Sleeper would be a better option for the range to get away from the pesky adds and no damage drop off.
---
If you’re a hunter run bottom tree golden gun, with celestial hawk-whatever if you have it.
---
In any case, Whisper is really easy to get and you don’t need the catalyst for it be good (though the catalyst makes it amazing).
---
Having a 3 stack also helps.
---
As someone who has played on both pc and ps4, I can confidently say pc is noticeably better. However, 50$ is a big difference, so if you don't mind long load times, frame drops in Gambit, and overall a bit rougher of an experience, console is still a viable option. 
---
20 more blockers you say?
---
Count me in.
---
More impressed by the use of hard light in PvP lol
---
You sound like a condescending wanker tbh. Anthem was still in Beta and less than 6 months point so your argument doesn’t even carry any weight you invalid. 
---
Don’t even presume shit based on what you think you know about me either you fucking dead ass piece of shit. I hope you get cancer and die. You deserve the ban just for suggesting it. 
---
Amen my dude FUCK the vanguard all they have done is bitch and cry and hide behind thier walls. more and more I realize after the red war I realize the vanguards complete and utter ineptitude. 1. An ENTIRE cabal Armada should never have entered Earth's atmosphere with out the vanguard knowing or Rasputin alerting us. The vanguard have gotten too complacent and Zavalah is a pussy 
---
And your point about unfinished games is fucking pointless too because that’s exactly what Destiny2 is as well you ignorant fuck wit. 
---
This was a conversation about the grind not the luna's pvp capabilities
---
I have all the ones for nesses
---
Yeah, you need the annual pass.
---
The only thing that could kill destiny is the memes for the new dlc. 
---
If you don't bank what you have when I tell you there's enough to summon a primeval, your IQ is this small!
---
My point is that after we defeat Savathun, we'll still have to deal with xiva-arath (Hive God of war).
---
Damn! Thanks for the reply tho
---
And Xivu will be the weakest until both siblings fall... At which point they should be intensely powerful for putting her siblings.
---
Dont know why - but im choosing Drifters side :)
---
Isnt this upside down?
---
I just got that a few days ago from a Xur engram! I'll have to test this out. 
---
I can’t even get past the mines part
---
Well you have one day left :))
---
But a hunter didn't kill him... Therefore the bet was never filled!  An awoken Prince killed him.
---
He only does it I’m because he’s lonely and enjoys our company 
---
I used to be off Tues/Wed until I switched departments. This was the only good thing about having those days off and frankly, I miss it a lot :(
---
Boy, you never played a 1v4 gambit, havent you?
---
The uprising*... its happening*
---
Collector and invader look to have the best buffs to me. The red set looks dope so I assume everyone will be going invader.
---
Ima go ahead and say that you're comment and the shader comment killed me. Good stuff. 
---
Yikes he's being reprimanded for not dumping money like otherb people have the luxury of doing.
---
Your never late, play through all the campaigns and you'll be at the average end game level in no time.

Both powerful AND normal Ada weapon frames, but not the augmented frames.

Just get in and start the story, that will get you up to speed with everything, then you can begin to tackle the Forges and such. 
---
Brah build a character start leveling up. By the time you get to end game you should be alright but may wanna meet some friends way better that way.
---
I disabled v-sync and the lag disappeared completely (seems odd but it worked for me)
---
My accel coils/ opening shot/backup plan Cr Fang is a real bastard too. It’s a fantastic weapon 
---
You were likely having a different problem, because the issue caused by the Windows Update patch was unaffected by v-sync or anything related to it.
---
They both have purple. One is white with purple and gold accents, the other is *GOLD* with purple accents
---
Only the strong can afford mercy.
---
Why you do this in the middle of a gambit match my dude 
---
Thanks, just picked up the game this season. Was just wondering so I don’t have to grind for exotic quests
---
Thanks
---
Does anyone know why they're creating a key limit? From what I understand it doesn't matter how many keys you hold onto.
---
What type of guardian is the drifter? Like he looks like a hunter but has the warlock robes and titan shoulder pads🧐
---
Ah, didn’t know that. Even better!
---
r/madlads 😂😂☝️
---
But magic missile doesn’t need attack roll, its just D4’s
---
I’m not Bungie how would I know. I just assume they’d go away at some point for the sake of exclusivity 
---
That's your perception and perspective. Mine is completely different. Drifter all the way baby. 
---
[From the TWAB where they talked about that change](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/47602), it said this is part of how they are trying to ensure a level playing field at the start of the new season. When Black Armory started, people who saved up powerful gear bounties and stuff for months were WAAAAYYYY farther ahead than anyone else. 
---
That makes sense actually. 
---
Calus’ Collection
---
Maybe something like true invisibility at a long range (except for the lens flare from your weapon) and shimmering semi-invisibility at medium/close range?
---
I thought you were about to toaster em, but instead you microwaved em
---
Prometheus Lens
---
Rasputin is a wild card who could side with Drifter at a whim, or decide everyone is wrong and turn on them all. Rasputin doesn't have a side except for Rasputin's.
---
why even have the gun if you don't like playing crucible....
---
Can someone check on this man? I think he had a stroke between the title and the body.
---
Is it weird that I’m the most psyched for Sentry and Collector? Health regen near the bank? 20-more blockers?!?! This is gonna be awesome!
---
From what I've seen, this is apparently a new bug happening to players at random when they play Gambit.
---
[This Reddit Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/axbnbs/so_gambit_is_causing_some_issues/) has your post and another's listed. I don't think this is coincidence. There are comments on that post that has reported other users losing characters, too. It's happened more to XB and PC accounts. Not many PS4 reports.
---
I have also made a [Bungie Post](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Post/251192585) as well to spread the awareness, just in case.
---
Avoid Gambit. Or play at the risk of losing your Guardian. I for one will not be setting foot into Gambit or the new Gambit content until there's some sort of statement or more information on the matter. It's just not worth the risk.
---
Agree, with Invader perk that steals Motes, I see needing a Sentry a must.  And I bet those fights would be epic too, Invader damage buff vs Sentry aoe regen, personally I am going to grind for Sentry first then Invader armor sets.
---
Right on
---
It's fun in pve. 
---
It was, not after its nerf though.
---
F
---
I did malfeasance and breakneck at the same time so grind wasn’t terrible. To top it off I didn’t head back to the drifter until I finished both so it felt good to take both at the same time.
---
Tbh I am not that excited for this content as I was for everything else. Me playing gambit prime heavily depends on the type of weapons and rolls that drop and how they fair in the crucible. Or if exotics steps require you to play. 
---
I really wished the crucible pinnacle weapon was a sniper rifle tho but I will grind for that smg. 
---
pls no I'm just doing clue 
---
I did this + Lunas this season ... And yes.  Burnt on crucible is an understatement
---
enjoy ur 10 gp split
---
Malfeasance was and never will be better than Y1 Thorn. And Besides, after its nerf it was not annoying at all, you were almost handicapping yourself by using it
