Literally in all my years of both D1 and D2 I've never done a raid.
---
---
---
Hahaha, well played
---
Man these are fantastic! Thank you for sharing your hard work with us. What class do you play? Or if you are like me and play all three which ones your favorite?
---
Nice. More clear your collection notifications, i won't be able to sleep tonight.
---
If you've been to the Annex and found where he is meant to be, but he isn't there, try finishing Forsaken.
---
Well, someone‚Äôs popular
---
Hey thanks! Hunter NightStalker here! I have a Warlock/Titan but rarely play them.
---
No offense to you brother, but I've been playing since D1Y1. I just mixed up my footage. Kind of condescending when you put it like that. But hey, no hard feelings.
---
I can‚Äôt get more than 1 cabal or hive even though I‚Äôm redoing the strikes on mercury. üôÑ
---
I GOT IT REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
Oh thats awesome! I only played Titan in Destiny 1, but moving into Destiny 2 I branched off into Warlock as well, then finally hunter and I have to say my hunter experience has been the best out of the three, they just seem to flow more and all three of their supers seem to have a definite use. Do you have any other pieces of pixel art?
---
Tell that to the Primevil on Gambit
---
Damn I was unaware of this mechanic
---
Lol
---
Now I want to grind NF for exotics lol
---
Thank god he knew what he was doing, and wasn‚Äôt like those other noob blueberries trying to lie about his experience and knowledge in such a way that it actually becomes even more of a hinderance than needing it explained to him in the first place.
---
REEEEEEpost.
---
When the dreaming city looks like Minas Tirith
---
Pussy!!!
---
Someone make this a phone wall paper and I'll suck your nuts üòò
---
I'm gonna try that tomorrow and tell you how it went
---
I find bergusia worse than goffanon tbh. The end boss is only difference, in which i favor bergusia
---
The amount of telemetry I get compared to the amount of kills I‚Äôve made compared to how much gunsmith progress I get has me crying just a little inside each time.
---
It's restricted to level 20.
---

---
oh. I had that sniper last IB run.. I regret dismantling it :(
---
Big sigh. Rip your legendary shards. Could‚Äôve traded those for simulation seeds if you catch my drift(er).
---
Shotguns used defensively is strong
---
I finished both on the same day.
---
Thank you for not saying 16-bit.
---
Working as intended.
---
Fuck this gun
---
i never see anyone actually run any of these armors anymore
---
Way too true
---
thank you for telling me
---
I didn't want to talk more about this but I will elaborate here because I really appreciate the time you took to help and recognize artists; it's honestly folks like yourself that help us effectively counter-act art theft.
---

---
So yeah, they have a system locked in; sometimes linking to other accounts. I've been dealing with this for a few years and have kept track of and helped other artists in counter-acting this. It's certainly not bots, it's actually a surprisingly small amount of people split between many selling platforms that use the same methodology and even website code. Once you've seen a couple you start to recognize the patterns. They specifically prey on independent artists, and try to solicit sales using whatever sample of artwork they can steal back to fans either via 'fan page' advertisements on most social media platforms or via regular posts like this on social media and reddit. They also re-use the same artworks through different websites, making it near impossible for an artist to stop them through traditional means. This is basically a blanket way to keep stealing and selling someones art even if they follow required legal protocol of taking down the product when an artist takes the steps to protect their copyright (and I don't want to get into copyright here right now but I know somebody is going to reply, so yes, fan art still belongs to artists). That's IF they follow the law. A lot of the time they don't, because they're counting on independent artists not having the financial means to pursue legal action beyond a DMCA (thus why we're the prey).
---
Ultimately right now the best advice on the subject I can currently give out is (what you're already doing): If you like something and you think supporting the artist is important, just make sure you are supporting the artist (it takes very little time to do so).
---
Sorry about all the parenthesis; there's a lot to juggle in this topic and my attention is currently split. Let me know if I need to clarify anything.
---
u are welcome. I found it out a while ago when using a third party LFG site, which takes forever to find people. Then a guy i encountered told me this app exists. I don't know if it's official or not, but bungie should definitely support this kind of app if they don't feel like adding a recruit chat
---
Hey man I follow you on IG and really like your art. keep it up!
---
no it doesn‚Äôt work... def don‚Äôt try it yourself... shhhhhhhh
---
Maybe you‚Äôre confused about annihilation because that‚Äôs what 6 rapid kills mean. 
---
Seventh column means you‚Äôve killed every single enemy (6 of them) and then 1 more after. You get it after annihilation but you can‚Äôt break the chain after getting the 6th kill. 
---
You‚Äôve said it already that you got close to it since you got six rapid kills with super and got the medal for it, so then why would you expect a 7th column out of a 6th rapid kills??? That doesn‚Äôt make any sense. Your multi kill doesn‚Äôt track that 6 piece as 7 streak or 7th column. For every multi kill you get, it only counts as 1. Therefore, even if you pulled a six piece, there was a time where you pulled a double and or a triple counting it as your 2,3...7 multi kills. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Annual pass is alright, but if you are just wanting it for the thorn, then don‚Äôt bother.  The gun is ‚Äúmeh‚Äù at best. 
---
Black armory has some really good guns, and ‚Äúthe reckoning‚Äù is decently fun. With the annual pass you also get some silver so.
---
Every. Damn. Time.. I've started jumping and throwing them at the top.
---
Will ever receive the chance to get thorn again?
---
Last week‚Äôs invitation required you to get Cabal samples on Io and I was able to complete it on Mars. I‚Äôm not sure if it will work like that every week, but it seems like you don‚Äôt actually have to be in a specific location to get the samples.
---
Seems like they got nerfed
---
Ahh, makes sense. I'm only 630. I finally got matched up so I managed to finish it
---
Thats when you just lfg the next few games. I soloed to Heroic 2, got a group together and it only takes like 4 wins after that.
---
Nice man! There ya go

---
also, flawless execution, snare bomb and super on Sedia= she's dead
---
especially in void singe. 
---
that's how I destroyed her last time it was the NF
---
I honestly haven't watched a single raid video walkthrough. But on the same side of the coin all of the raids in the Leviathan ( I can't say Last Wish yet I've only done it once.) have pretty easy to understand mechanics once you're able to get them down in layman's terms.
---
And by layman's terms I mean I'll throw back what the sherpa explained in the simplest terms possible.
---
Though I'll throw an exception out for navigating the jungle (forest, whatever) for dogs, if the goal is to get the maximum spores unnoticed
---
I use Asperite. Proportions are just something that work themselves out; I have my style, I draw how I draw and I draw what looks right. If you're starting out with pixelart and looking for resources please check out lospec.com
---
Love em
---
A streamer I was WATCHING (and myself) both have been getting an enormous skew towards pulse rifles, with maybe 1 spare rations drops for an entire night of grinding. I don't think you're unlucky, there's legit data collected after multiple days of grinding that says there's something off with the HC drop rate
---
Is love to see a mobile game in this style. Maybe playing it could earn you enhancement cores for use in D2
---
For anyone unaware, bows do a similar thing when you shoot the statues
---
Have you done any others? If not, we'll you? Maybe the vanguard and other tower vendors, and some enemy units
---
Obviously I cannot pay you for this, just do it for priceless exposure :P
---
Week 8 on a row of A Thousand Voices hunting. After the loop drop rate increase, I can confirm I am still not a Rivensbane. Send help pls
---
Damn man, i can hear the Music just by looking at this.
---
Suggest you watch some YouTube videos about gambit/prime. You‚Äôll most likely learn something :)
---
Its a pvp gun that 3 taps with a 0.8 ttk and has really high stats in all areas that are desirable for a scout.  However it is only decent on a few maps and is usually outclassed by max range blast furnace.  Its exotic perk is pretty useless.
---
Honestly, the only thing that kills me in the reckoning is knight slams on the bridge. It gets infuriating fast.
---
What if I told you that it happened twice for me? One time was Gwisin Vest (was hoping Xur woukd sell it and he did) and then yesterday it was Shards of Galanir. I told my clanmates that I didn‚Äôt have it and it was the last subclass-specific exotic that I really wanted. That was early in the week. Lo and behold, I killed a random yellow bar enemy on Earth (I think it was the wanted servitor in Trostland) and out pops a yellow engram. I was thinking something ‚Äúmeh‚Äù, but nope. It was Shards. Made me the happiest little hunter and they dropped at 700 too!
---
Don't forget the Lightless Guardian surviving a thousand-foot fall off a ship, then dying from a Taken Phalanx looking in their general direction. 
---
Being a Guardian makes gravity your bitch. But only gravity.
---
Very well done. üëç
---
Could you make this a wallpaper? This is amazing!
---
You keep saying meta but those strays didn‚Äôt get used as much as you think. The last two maybe but not the rest.
---
No it‚Äôs destiny 2.
---
It's a good weapon, but a scout rifle.
---
That's why it was good in D1 and bad in D2.
---
Clarifying the situation:
---
A user posted u/Spykles's pixel art w/o credit, and proceeded to link the "source" to his own shop. Spykles found this unacceptable, and so should i have. I acted too late, but I ended up acting. Posting art without credit AND profiting off of it will not be tolerated on r/destiny2. Spykles is very talented, let's not exploit that.
---
no bu we all got it from the fated engram because it was the last piece we was all missing
---
I understand that feeling, if I had money to give you the annual pass I would! To help out a fellow gaurdian!
---
Appreciate the sentiment, saving up man money‚Äôs tight üòÇ
---
Yeah it feels like I've been dying a lot more by getting smacked/stomped into walls lately. Blows my mind that you can survive multiple rounds of like .50 Magnum or something, but good luck if you get shield bashed and there is a wall 50+ft behind you.

Calus dont want his agents looking unfashionable
---
Hes in korea, where they have internet cafes that allow players to "rent" gear.
---
More like he lives in korea where they have internet cafe that allow players access to dlc and gear that only works when physically at that location. Google "Destiny 2 Yuna"
---
I mean he's in love with the player why wouldn't he wanna make em look sexy?

What hit it back?

I have one with Opening Shot and Zen Moment. This means zero recoil I land the initial shot. It's a damn laser...

What are those yellow things on the ground? I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen one of those out in the wild like that.

Khajiit has wares, if you have coin
---
Dammit, now I have to go grind for another roll!
---
~~tower~~ orbit
---
Of course it could be a ps4 player.

what does one cost?
---
Except Polaris Lance is better in every way *and* not useless in PvE
---
 Urrently waiting on my cursebreaker medallion. I cannot effing wait.

So glad you knew what I meant. As for the size thay is a bit disappointing. I thought they were bigger than that.

He gave me geomags &lt;3
---
Nice!!
---
Got the curated mindbender's ambition on my first run :D
---
They make you work so hard to get these and then make you pay for them.
---
Lmfao
---
The Dredgen one isn't that bad, just a lot of grinding.  You can bust it out in a month if its worth it to you (plus it's got the coolest emblem)
---
 **Whether we wanted it or not we‚Äôve stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars**
---
Gotcha. See ya next week!
---
I totally agree :(.. And it's not even just for Y1 armors in Y2; it'd even help the problems cropping up in Y2 with limited time gear that you have bad rolls on! (S4/S5/S6 eververse, iron banner, event armors)
---
I‚Äôm always low on shards, how do you guys get so many?
---
For scout rifles try Polaris Lance, if you haven't.
---
That‚Äôs pretty neat, I like your art style.
---
I did bug in the system 1.25 times and both strikes and had everything. Wasnt that bad.
---
I don't feel the need to do it on three characters though.
---
Spiders mission, the person in the dreaming city(forgot her name), strikes and crucible
---
Okay I thought it was per slot thanks for letting me know
---
I still haven't done this yet
---
Worth it %100
---
Got it this week and it‚Äôs fun in crucible w/recluse
---
around 5 hours, I believe
---
well its free thunderlord to anyone who doesn't already have it so that's something

Some would say marketing trickery, others will say patch notes and the rest will tell you that it's nothing.

Here is the answer!!

You have to finish the quest step before Tuesday either you don't get a new this week! 
---
God damn tamponface XUR YOU GOT ME:):)
---
A titan always has to look strong even in the most shaming armor he/she would ever wear 
---
~~but hot damn they look good~~
---
you are best off getting the dlc as you get all the new and up to date fun content
---
What is this named? I haven‚Äôt gotten through the leviathan raid yet, so I have no idea what I‚Äôm looking at.
---
Hunter just needs a couch and... never mind.
---
Taken ogres are so annoying.
---
the song is pegboard nerds - swamp thing if anyone is wondering
---
Participation trophy you paid for, congrats.
---
Yes they are against the rules. Most recoveries don't have people actually playing matches, they're using programs to fix matches so they don't have to play them at all and get free wins. Its against the ToS always.
---
Thanks!
---
Hey thanks!
---
I-.... I didn‚Äôt know I needed this. Thank you for gracing me with this amazing content. This was hilarious lol
---
Bring chromas and armor ornaments like this back plz
---
There isn't any end game if you don't own Forsaken. 
---
To see what to do next, open up the director and hold the  button shown in the upper left (on PC this is E). This brings up some objectives. 
---
&gt;lots of NPCs everywhere and I don't know what they do
---
Have you tried talking to them and hovering over the icons in the page that comes up? The best way to learn is by trying things out for yourself.
---
So welcome!
---
Haha agreed. We think the same üëåüèº
---
The hunter also just does some flashy shit then gets slapped cuz theyre balloons. Titan takes fists to the face. Warlock just does their best Neo impersonation
---
It was kinda hysterical watching these hunters on both teams just blade spamming each other in one half the map. No one else went near those knife jugglers. Few of us just went to watch (couple died in random blade track)
---
In terms of difficulty for a first clear from hardest to easiest:
---
Prestige Spire of Stars
---
Prestige Leviathan
---
Last Wish
---
Leviathan
---
Spire of Stars
---
Prestige Eater of Worlds
---
Scourge of the Past
---
Eater of Worlds

You had to strategize in D1 regardless of team communication. Supers were an option of your play style not the central turning point to an entire match. I hate using my Luna's and recluse in PvP. It doesn't feel as challenging nor fun. It's appalling to see a dude that has over 15k kills with a Luna's and 8k Dust rock kills. D1 had creativity to loadouts. Everything seemed balanced (imo) and there was always a counter to everything or so it seemed. Just depended on the person's skill not the weapon they held. Never hated a match of PvP (except when I ran into a group of cheaters during trials that have since been banned). Other than that it blows... Glad to know there's another out there that feels the same way
---
I had to check just so I could see that
---
Why did i listen to this
---
Was she missing her feet in the floor?
---
You don't get anything for completing the Lore book; I know that much from experience.
---
Those *guarantee* an item drop. Are you sure it didn't go to your postmaster? Or was there nothing displayed on the right side of the screen at all when you should have had an item reward icon pop up? 
---
I would recommend posting on the Bungie help forums. That is the official place to report bugs.
---
Yeah i ordered mine before Season of Drifter started for perspective
---
No
---
Neat idea.
---
I understand how Blink works, it goes whichever direction you're moving. But it just feels off.
---
I used to think this same trick worked with Xur and Prismatic facets.
---
Ah, too bad. I thought that was it, because i found her like that once.
---
I always lose countdown and I always win all the other modes.
---
Grow thicc from strength
---
Tether is designed to be a trap, not a panic super. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called ‚ÄúWay of the Trapper‚Äù. Requires forethought to be effective.
---
Read the Lore and you'll see that he asks not to come back and also asks you to not look into cayde 1-5s past.
---
Really? Why's that?
---
By stats, do you mean power level? The power level of gear from collections is always 20 power levels below your own highest possible power level.
---
The only character that had some depth has been killed off... bad idea IMHO.
---
I don't know who would tell you mayhem was a good spot for that part of the TLW quest, but they're a terrible person and a liar. Mayhem is the best for doing the blood for blood and revenge medal step. It is TERRIBLE for the other part. Just play defensively and stick with your teammates and you'll knock it out sooner than later.
---
I've only done Leviathan. But from what I've seen of the raids, it's looks like the easiest by far.
---
What if we play as a new guardian and Nathan Fillion voices our new ghost?
---
Kings Fall
---
I've only ever completed Scourge of the Past and from what I've seen of it, it looks like one of the easiest raids. But I guess none of us are in good positions to talk about that since we've only played through one
---
Not illegal.
---
The enemy team can also invade if your team has 0 motes and they can bank for a Primeval. Seems legit.
---
I've never experienced this, I've only played 3 rounds of Prime. Not a Gambit person.
---
But that's kind of bs, isn't it?
---
God Destiny 2 is fucking pretty. Like the significant other who pisses you off sometimes but then they smile and all is forgiven.
---
Problem is that the moon was dedicated to a DLC, recieved a raid and 2 (later 3) strikes. Along with a deep connection of underground tunnels. But the patrol area was not that exciting.
---
Titan has only one strike.
---
Titan is missing the underground.
---
I kinda wish they left mercury out in D2 instead.
---
No chance you're a Cursebreaker now that the drop chances have gone up is there? 
---
I have been on the grind for just as long and I still haven't gotten the cosmetics with the increased drop rates :(
---
Yeah.
---
I'll probably never do the other two.
---
I might end up just running the first encounter of SotP in hopes of getting Threat Level.
---
I‚Äôm on ps4 and could really use the help getting it. Been in the boss room 4-5 times now and always ran out of time.
---
Sorry, your submission has been automatically removed.

It appears you are asking a question about LFG/Clans, or help in-game. 
---
Please post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/89vbwr/official_lfg_megathread_version_20/?sort=new) instead, look at the LFG dropdown menu on the top bar of the subreddit for various LFG tools, or check the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/8ji06r/official_faq_please_read_before_posting/) for possibly helpful advice on how to find people to play with our advertise/find clans.

Literally the exact same thing is happening to me.
---
I've done about 100 runs of Tier 2.
---
I've gotten 1 drop of Spare Rations, which I **really** want a good roll on 
---
I've also gotten 15 fully-masterworked pulse rifles.
---
There seems to be quite a pattern...
---
Sure I'm gonna be online for an hour now before I go sleep so if your ready then I can help right now but otherwise just add me and whenever we are both on shoot me a message and I'll probably help then
---
Yeah, or you can dismantle them. All exotics, and all items from the first year of the game, can be reclaimed from the collections tab of your character menu. Items you get from the collections tab are always precisely 20 power levels below you if you were to put on all your highest gear.
---
This is getting out of hand!
---
How long has the backlog for the seal pins? I ordered my Wayfarer one a month ago and at the time, the estimated delivery was 2-3 months behind. Congrats on that, by the way!
---
We already have 3.
---
Chillii why
---
I don't know if you realize that, but 6 Cores for 700 shards is twice as good as 30 Cores for 7k Shards (which is what OP got)
---
Same thing with blade barrage
---
Hey everyone it‚Äôs Rick Kahkis here
---
You are not alone in this. The grind is worse then reaching Fabled itself and I just stopped at 20% for the trajectory and double kills. Trajectory wouldn't be as bad if we could finally get Lake of Shadows as Nightfall again for MB but the double kills...
---
I actually love my AoS and use it in my bb Hunter but now I just got my Luna's and I find out that I have shit aim with it and have only gotten 2 triple tap kills (2 headshots to activate the howl and the last shot to kill) in over 130 kills I got with it (this number is based on the progress bar filling up in the quest for not forgotten). With the introduction of recluse I'm noticing a slight increase (very slight but noticeable) in other weapon combinations especially in maps that have both long open spaces and tight corridors.
---
Someone recently did a yt video on the pve end of the perks and it was something like rampage x3 is only a bit higher than swashbuckler x5 both somewhere at the 60-65% then kill clip is 50% and Multikill is 100% at x3 66.6% at x2 and 33.3% at x1.
---
Rampage and Multikill clip being the highest boost, but idk the way swashbuckler works getting the full stack on a melee kill makes it easy to keep the buff up so I prefer it lately with the new Frontal Assault buff
---
I‚Äôm sick of seeing these posts
---
Wow. Chills.
---
*ah I see you are a man of culture as well*
---
Friend of mine gave me advice for that, spam the hell out of Fighting lion in comp, forget rank, forget winning. This is a weapon/playstyle locked kind of quest, treat it as one.  
---
I also have had ot completely stop playing Destiny as of late due to this being so RNG based and pubs.
---
A man of culture.
---
If it makes you feel any better, curated rolls never drop as engrams on the ground. They go directly to your inventory (or postmaster if inventory is full) right when the forge ends. What you saw is a visual bug that happens whenever you don‚Äôt have room in your inventory for a forge weapon.
---
