Well we had age of triumphs at the end of year one. We‚Äôll definitely have something like that for year two as well.
---
---
---
That was Solstice of Heroes
---
I am (terribly) playing a crucible match in destiny 2. While trying to take a zone I meet a fellow teammate who requests a fist bump. The second our fists touch I get sniped by an opponent.
---
Riiight üòÖ I hear whispers of us going into year 3 with D2 so the end game is still far away. Fingers crossed tho!
---
Just got the Annual pass on my PC recently (coming from PS4), and I gotta be honest. I forgot how much of a grind it is to get to max light. Let alone all the exotic quests.
---
When you logged in a short while ago, there was a popup notification saying Revelry orb generation has been disabled in raids, competitive crucible, and gambit because it was causing a lot of crashes. This means you can complete the triumph in non-competitive crucible (quickplay, rumble, iron banner). In the current This Week at Bungie news post, they said they will decrease the orbs required to be 20 on the competitive triumph because of this. 
---

---
The triumphs aren't really clear about this, but they only count the revelry orbs, meaning orbs that come from headshots. Normal masterwork and super orbs don't count.
---
You have until May 7 to do this, so you still have plenty of time!
---
Got a laugh from me. 
---
Most people already understand the reference you‚Äôre making just by hearing the voice line/reading it though. Next time I would shy away from putting the video of whatever you‚Äôre using on the screen as well and just doing a subtle chat bubble/headline type over whoever is saying the line. 
---
This is purely just my opinion though, but the video block kind of detracts from the rest of the meme-y vibe you‚Äôre trying to send. But, like I said, the vid still made me laugh. Especially the error message sound at the end when he missed his charge. You did a great job &lt;3
---
Ahh thank you.
---
*People with friends who could run them through it on the first day.
---
Same
---
I just used mine for everything PvE until it was done.  Seems pretty rng based tbh. It took 4-5K kills to get the first 8 and then 9 dropped 5 kills later. Good luck.
---
Ummmm sweaty, it‚Äôs actually arbalest and recluse meta üòé
---
I rewatched and caught the ability use. I have never played a hunter. Going to rewatch it to catch the other things you are so upset about. But I actually hope I randomly end up on your comp team.
---
The freaking detail in the skyboxes and I guess groundboxes? in this game really are something else.
---
So the top tree has a stackable buff where if you melee it gets a damage buff and recharged dodge. So dodge to recharge your melee, repeat up to 3 stacks for 20 seconds. Then the exotic chest piece enhances damage output during super which stacks with the melee buff for insane damage.
---
Got a chuckle out of me. I needed it too. Well done
---
Ya it's sucks on pc. I bought it again just so I could experience it on console
---
How?  Did you just wander in there while in the edz?
---
I firmly believe something got screwed this season with exotics. 
---
I've been playing a majority of the time on my Hunter, but my Titan and Warlock have seen more exotics and in a shorter period of time. 
---
With that being said it's been nonstop duplicates. It's been so bad that I've gotten the exact same exotics in the same day and within an hour at one point. 
---
There is something wrong.
---
Have you got the red string of fate ornament? I just got malfeasance last night and the ornament is transfixing.
---
What
---
no wayyyyy
---
Depending on how much we play, there should br something in place to stop this. This is worse than the beginning of forsaken, but no ones speaking about this because the new ones aren't worth going for.
---
Not useless, they pair excellently with le monarque in pvp.
---
__If only I had a phone that could run it. Which I do but I need to set it up still...__
---
He laments that he doesn‚Äôt have a phone he can run it on, and then says he does
---
2x Rampage does but not 1x.
---
Either way he's got a fun PvE weapon now
---
OP whats the Masterwork?
---
I got a handling master work, was thinking it‚Äôs gonna be good for pve, love midnight coup have almost 15,000 kills with it so I reckon this will be good
---
Damn still better than vendor roll though
---
For sure i use my Outlaw/Rampage for PVE and PVP
---
Aye good to mix it up every now and then
---
MW orbs don‚Äôt count - just Revelry ones from Precision kills.
---
Easy no guns: [https://youtu.be/m6SsySCtcl0?list=PLimCoc8JnoM2qC\_8te1KjeJ2Uqn7rlM4S](https://youtu.be/m6SsySCtcl0?list=PLimCoc8JnoM2qC_8te1KjeJ2Uqn7rlM4S)
---
also works by switching subclass during thundercrash
---
Hey, were did they mention that? Do you have the link? I have 68/200 yeat just want to be sure before the event is over. Thanks
---
Yeh I challenge you to do breakneck in one weekend and still say it's fun.lol
---
Breakneck is easy wdym??? 21% is way harder getting to 15000 is just grind
---
Well, you don't lose standing for a loss like in comp, and with the sheer amount of gambit quests there are now it has never been easier to reset your rank. Keep doing quests and don't stress too much about winning or losing even on the 12-15k bracket. Even easier the more characters you have so you their quests too.
---
So u did breakneck in a day?
---
Yeah Red String was one of the first ornaments I got in game and is what prompted me to get the gun
---
Probably less than I never used ars until my friend told me to get breakneck and I finished in a day I mean I no lifed it but I got it 21% took me about a month
---
Hello there I am! Nice to meet you.
---
Damn. Nice job dude
---
Yeah, honestly I'm a big fan of Black Scorpion 4sr on that map but on smaller maps I do like my Tiger. I'm using Suros Regime atm as I have to unlock the catalyst. That's a decent gun but honestly my favourite is my Zen moment/Rampage Hazard of the Cast.
---
OMG This is like when the call comes on, I bank my 2 motes waiting for teammates to do the same only to have the last fella jump through the portal to invade. And die. If I could, I'll shoot that fella myself.
---
Oh yeah then fuck that guy lol I mean we all have bad days but yeah lol that's shitty
---
F
---
Ok. You know there are clans out there, right? You know they friend carry people to pinnacles all the time, right? That bad of numbers... Hard for me to believe someone would pay for those. But Whatever.
---
People know that. I just felt like this would make a great meme for the situation, since its pretty relatable to the first runs they had.
---
Thunderlords for everyone!
---
I come from console and the controller for me is actually easier to aim with. *I snipe with a controller  on pc*  and i still have not gotten past the learning curve so to me i dont see what u mean its not just a point and click my dude. But yes thank you for pointing out this post is about separating sandbox changes
---
The final day where you said you would see them in the other side. But never did.
---
I honestly think that you literally don't even need dredgen to be burn out, I got breakneck and all I can think when I see it pop up is just "Hah! No"
---
I feel the pain. Every time I swap from arc to void and get surrounded by thrall.
---
He forgot to switch to his burner account.
---
Just gotta get lucky with those engrams, as far as I can tell! I managed to eke out the whole set as of yesterday just from ‚Äúleveling up‚Äù rewards.
---
Must be Activision trolls.
---
I don't think there is a way to fi that, is there a reason why you want it without the expansions?
---
:(
---
Ah ... nice, did not catch that quote. Shame, should've.
---
But, sorry, you did not get the meaning of the post at all. I was trying to say that the way they did it is a supremely bad game design decision with literally no possible good outcome. If they wanted to get people into liking PvP, then they failed spectacularly with this and couldn't have chosen a much worse route.
---
(Btw, I love the Gambit-mode. Much better design decisions which show how you can do things.)
---
Glad I already have mine for when lh / nf get ruined with the nerf.
---
I'm having fun running around perpetually invisible in crucible
---
In the app, with video full screen, press and hold a finger on the screen. It‚Äôll pull up options, one of them is save video.
---
Hey I have a clip that would be perfect for a video like that. I'm not sure how I would send it to you. It's recorded on my friend's playstation.
---
Wow! Thanks a lot man!!
---
I'd be ok with that
---
I don‚Äôt understand how this got a real lol out of me but I found it hilarious
---
This is good use of waiting for the elevator
---
No you start at the first one.
---
The last sale I've seen was the digital copy on the blizzard app forpre-christmas.
---
Not per character, once per account.
---
My warlock looks exactly the same
---
you'd think for a god who supposedly lives for thousands of years, 30 minutes would be nothing.
---
I'm also going through an extremely tough time. Eyes up guardian. "The weight of the world was on your shoulders, and still you triumphed. Marvelous."
---
This reminds me of the Semi "I stay automatic" vine where his brother is shooting hoops in the background and the ball bouncedsoff the rim and hits him in the face
---
that's a pretty nice midnight coup
---
What's that for?
---
This seasons bungie store emblem
---
The revelry will be over next week. Without that, they are really not that impressive. Yes they can force you to run instead of shoot, but arc web grenades do THE EXACT SAME THING. The only way to not die is to run far away from any teammates, which in quick play, is harder than running from a skip grenade.
---
You can only complete one at a time and if you don't complete it by Thursday reset the following week, the next Invitation won't be available until the next weekend when Xur shows up again.
---
This is personally my least favorite season. (I started back in Season 4.)
---
I absolutely loved Black Armory. The forges were a really neat idea, and it added some of the best exotics in the game (J√∂tunn and Izanagi's Burden).
---
Season 6 was absolutely Gambit focused, and that was really it. Hardly anything except Prime, Reckoning, and a lot of Lore (Invitations).
---
I can't wait for Season 7. Finally a Leviathan-based matchmaking activity! 
---
Although, even though I don't have them yet, I'm not excited for the Luna/NF nerf. Once they're nerfed, people are gonna start complaining about weapons like Ace and TLW, neither of which need a nerf imo. Nerfing Luna/NF is only going to change what weapons the higher-tier players are gonna use, not how easily they stomp teams.
---
I don‚Äôt play quick play though
---
What do you play?
---
Comp
---
A truly helpful guardian above! My added advice: don‚Äôt stress it. Do the things you enjoy doing and ask for help/look it up when you come across something you don‚Äôt understand. It‚Äôs a very involved game if you‚Äôre just now starting but soon it‚Äôll be like 2nd nature. Just don‚Äôt try to bite it all in one setting. Use guides and reddit. There is some salt out there, but I‚Äôve found that there are many helpful guardians (even if only during a humble-brag). Have fun!
---
Thank you i just recently started to paint more realistic
---
Says it's been redeemed.
---
It‚Äôs pretty much the exact same in comp, if not worse. In comp, sticking and working together is much more important which makes arc grenades even more powerful (harder to get away and more people targeted at once) and makes skip grenades weaker (damage is shared over a larger group).
---
Why you bully me :(
---
Slap some bow arms on a linear fusion rifle and you've basically got yourself a bowcaster from Star wars.
---
In 45 games:
---
Expectation: Fabled, 2100
---
Reality: 1000
---
Yeah, it does melt although actually requires, you know, aiming - fine for PVE stuff, but I‚Äôm definitely worse at deleting invaders with it.
---
What about it
---
Tap and hold and it should pop up a menu with a choice to ‚ÄúSave Video‚Äù
---
Gonna be honest I saw the video before I noticed the other guy's username and panicked that it was me
---
My guess is this one is next on the nerf chair, and Blast furnace after that. Yup, not even worth the effort
---
u know ive ranted about this multiple times. in d2 we live in a space traveling era , where we transmat across the galaxy and travel to the edges of it. but yeah u cant call ada -1 and be like : hey could u transmat me that frame?  
---
TRANSMAT FIRING.  
---
now u can imagine how many times this happened to me xDDD
---
‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be right back.‚Äù
---
I believe you can still get them from the cryptarch‚Äôs engrams.
---
i get mine tomorrow after reset :)
---
I consider myself a pretty good warlock but I‚Äôm on pc. Thank you anyway üòä
---
I‚Äôll definitely look into getting the mountaintop. I love grenade launchers.
---
You have to enter before the reset. When reset happens you wont be able to enter untill full curseweek comes around again. üòä
---
Well done as always!

Back in the day, Far Cry (for PC) had a great community, especially in Assault. You had to be a team player if you wanted to win. I miss Assault.
---
You call him a clown but I guarantee you've done something equally as silly at some point.
---
It is funny, though.
---
I think a lot of people underestimate how much Bungie is considering the thought process of people who get killed by a weapon like Luna's/NF compared to any other gun. Sure, the numbers for the gun are pretty alright but there's just a really awful feeling to dying to a gun you likely wont ever be able to get your hands on. This is a UNIQUELY crucible-pinnacle problem, considering any other pinnacle or weapon, for the most part, is mostly an investment of time, barring a few things, though almost nothing that's as punishing as Comp climbs can be. Like sure, there's a point where you can go "What did I do wrong there" but it's harder to lean on that in a looter shooter like D2 because you also have the gear to consider, and I think you did a great job of showing that in a way that I don't think would lead to calls of entitlement. Great discussion.
---
I'm on pc unfortunately but thanks for the hope :)) I'm getting into a new clan and will try to find someone to help me.
---
Electronic or paper and pencil, w/ paint? If you did it on paper and pencil you are fabulous at drawing
---
Happy cake day and also don‚Äôt give up I hope to see you in the crucible destroying me with recluse!
---
Because..... They didn't program it to be a weak point ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Yeah but like EVERY OTHER VEX RADOLAIRIAN SPOT is a crit! So why the hell not?
---
I've had this happen in the exact same spot
---
Fuck off,
---
I love The Colony for just this reason.
---
Agree with the leg proportion thing, it feels like the knee on his right leg is in the wrong spot. Besides that, it's alot better than anything I could, and it looks pretty good, nice job.
---
*Suicide*
---
So they have made it better for people that are not necessarily good with it? i.e. people that bought NF?
---
Much appreciated lmaooo
---
Thanks Obama
---
What the fuck did you bring upon this cursed land?!
---
depends on the roles. I got one with kill clip that can two tap to the head

---
I just tried the arbalest with a sub because of this comment and all I can say is...  wow.
---
Is this what playing on meta feels like?
---
I literally laughed my ass off
---
Ive gotten about 7 this week also. One every songle day ive played and 2 yeaterday. Ive honestly never been thos lucky before, even in my D1 days
---
Honestly? Using Luna‚Äôs got stale on probably the third day I had it. Yeah, it‚Äôs pretty absurd. But it‚Äôs not fun to use. It just feels...grimy. But that‚Äôs my personal experience with it. I‚Äôll still use it if I‚Äôm helping a buddy or a clan mate get Recluse, but I haven‚Äôt used it in QP or even Iron Banner since the week I got it.
---
Yes I am, made this after reading the latest lore on him. And what I meant was to have a title more about him and less about Dredgen (and said title) although their paths are intertwined.
---
I think I saved a clip of it lol
---
Philly over here 100% agree lol
---
Both has zen moments dude.l
---
It could be worse... they could hand the game over to the idiots who let Anthem out into the wild!
---
F.
---
Over 20 times during an Iron banner match... day one small inconveniences
---
The extra range gives more bullet magnetism too, hence more aim assist.
---
Use iron burden to get down to 1 ll
