I hit 5500 on Xbox lol I'm getting farmed on PC but PM your GT I'll add you and we can run sometime
---
---
---
saying "they're so op" doesn't really explain anything... as i said, every class has strong aspects to it, you just have to not be tunnel visioned.
---
Shadow and Rivensbane are definitely my favorites! Might pick up Harbinger as well
---
Sorry, but I've got nothing on the time outs, I occasionally get the attempting to connect to d2 servers.. I'm curious what load out your team was running, characters, skill trees and mods.  A sub 10 minute branch 9 clear is very impressive.
---
Ight I already hit 5500 but it‚Äôs just nice to play with some random people from time to time
---
Ight cool
---
I logged out and got it no worries
---
I use karnstien thunder coil so I punch them all the time. Really bad habbit.
---
You unlocked skyrim dlc

Lmao and for my next trick I'll kill myself to place the raid banner! *Proceeds to calculate the angle needed for the grenade*

Did you get fabled in the survival playlist (glory points, or the other ones (Valor points)?
---
Actually I served 4 and a half years in the U.S Navy and I‚Äôm in school to be a Lineman right now. Keep your negativity off reddit.
---
Agree, but rather double tap, like the hunter's dodge roll. This way you can do it immediately instead of the time limit until it counts as "held" working as a delay
---
It's a joke about the video chill not .-.
---
As if bubbles aren‚Äôt required for every PvE activity now
---
Because you could solo one phase a raid boss and obliterate any boss that you could punch
---
Nice, my dude! Always nice see to see a fellow Shadow
---
Damn, i mostly use black armory weapons and I've been looking to pimp them out just that little bit more, thanks homie
---
Complete as many weekly activities as you can. That will get you toward 950. It helps to have 3 characters for higher more frequent gun drops, it would be a big help in your climb. Just keep equipping the highest guns, worry about infusing later. And try to complete as many bounties as you can. Many can be completed during your weekly activities.
---
Thank you!
---
Just the normal simple bounties or do you mean others?
---
2 of those people are running six shot
---
then do what u want? not like the races matter at all except different cutscenes i guess
---
Legit how I dance irl I was super blown away when I first saw it. Felt like someone must‚Äôve followed me around with a camera.
---
The only effort comes from deciding what team you will be on.
---
Adorable
---
Yup I say to the people saying that titans are op that hunters have the dodge which is by far the best get out of a bad situation move in pvp plus their jumps and warlocks can use hand held supernova and they can heal with almost any of their abilities
---
I dont even get how it happens but it happens so often and I hate it
---
I LOVE DOING THIS. 
---
people freak out like where tf is the banner *this* time? there‚Äôs been a few times where i‚Äôve gotten the banner so high, nobody could reach it lmao
---
Bad luck, but also lower-tier competitive players sometime take team-play too literally, and end up using the same loadouts and attempting to team-shot, and that is what I see every season
---
I was playing comp with my friend and we were playing against an oem titan that had full strength using dust rock blues and recluse and he was just chasing us trying to melee us
---
Contraverse is certainly a very good exotic, but it‚Äôs no outlier, it‚Äôs essentially a really good shotgun without the shotgun part, and in that same sense something like Erentil (which IS an outlier) does everything supernova does, but better. Now compare whats essentially a low range fusion rifle to a mask that gives you wallhax, health, an overshield and bonus damage on the simple action of being shot and securing a kill, in a fps, that‚Äôs stupid, they‚Äôre not comparable in the slightest.
---
I firmly believe titans and warlocks both need full reworks. Reasoning:
---
Hunters have 3 unique melees and additional and varied effects on all of them. Their class ability, Dodge, activates instantly, has several different effects based on class (like turning invisible, reducing incoming damage) and can be used to circumvent certain weapon types long reload types or nullifying a low strength build. 
---
Warlocks get a couple neat grenade tricks, but this is limited to (i believe) 4 of the 9 subclasses not counting an exotic. They also have a single class that effects the Rift with maybe a handful of exotics. 
---
Titans basically have 5 different punches, 3 of which on the surface look basically interchangeable. They have no sub class that effects the barricade and a *single* exotic that does and they have no interesting interactions with grenades outside of Commander.
---
No. Infusing only gives the item the power level of the infused item.
---
Ok
---
Unfortunately liars handshake doesn‚Äôt counter this üôÅ
---
And old d2 copies come with a cold heart code
---
Mercury has a vex strike, and the Norris strike on mars for hive
---
You need to stop being so elitist dude. I get you probably don't have alot going on, but no one cares how good you are at destiny
---
Yes. One thing thats really undervalued when it comes to defining what the top weapons are is their weapon pairings. 
---
So how strong recluse is makes a direct impact to how strong some kinetic weapons are and how viable some energy weapons are too. Which pretty much means mountaintop is stronger now.
---
I'm with people saying recluse is the problem, but I can see why people put a lot of it on mountaintop.
---
But untill the day I see more mountaintop/recluse in legend rank comp, I will always put it below tlw/snipe which I don't expect any time soon.
---
I'll throw that on par with middle arcstrider's inconsistent activation before and after the attempted fix. 
---
Understandably different issues, one has been bugged for far longer after all, but on par.
---
Always the liar..
---
F
---
I doubt the author will
---
You‚Äôre an idiot lmao.
---
I thought I knew what was gonna happen.
---
I was both right and wrong
---
A few nights earlier, a female warlock was crouched, and I uh, crouched on her repeatedly.
---
I got needs man.
---
you're not the author?
---
That's my point though. Whenever I damage a Titan and he has OEM and he gets away. I don't sprint wildly after him. I actually don't do that against any class that escapes either. Because 9/10 times that person has the advantage on you. Unless you were right in their face, they'll get their health back, they know where you're coming from, they'll switch to the best close range option and will probably drop a smoke bomb or grenade on you when you turn the corner, or they'll have a teammate next to them waiting to gun you down. OEM gets me a cheeky slug shotgun kill maybe once every couple games due to the tracking. 
---
Only reason I use it on my Titan is because all their other PvP exotics are tied to a specific ability or playstyle. OEM is just always active. Like Ophidian Aspects or Dragons Shadow (which does require an ability but one that recharges in like 6 seconds with bottom tree arc)
---
I would like that as well
---
Ohhh, I didn‚Äôt think of that when I made the comment, but thanks for shedding a new LIGHT on it
---
To win press R
---
People seem to prefer izanagi, but whisper is a comparable weapon. It‚Äôs excellent if you don‚Äôt miss any precision shots.
---
so... how do i know what planet has hive or vex?
---
So strikes with vex are; inverted spire, insight terminus(barely), a garden world, tree of probabilities,  the pyramidian, the new one on io, and theres some vex in warden of nothing.
---
Hive strikes are; broodhold, savathun's song, strange terrain, and will of the thousands.
---
I haven't had a single problem with arc or Spectral since their fixes. Because from what I can tell they changed their Melee hit to be a very small AOE. Because I've killed people by swiping past them, and have been killed by both those supers while behind the hunter, or if I'm behind a teammate and we'll both get killed with a single light attack. 
---
Vs the Titan super attack like sentinel or striker can be abused by jumping above them because they still require a hit to connect, even though the animations of sentinel make it seem like it's an AOE.
---
See games do mess with us!
---
Yea but they can charge grenades to make them instant kills, hunters really have no one-hit kill like Titan (aside from precision throwing knife hits) and no grenade that can insta-kill aside from a really well placed trip mine. Kinda hard to see the struggle.
---
You should try Antaeus Wards. It's also always active and really helps  during engaging/disengaging. I normally slide into encounters, which gives me a shield during the slide, reflects damage given back at them (sometimes, hard to aim it) and gives you a bit of super. If I'm in trouble during an engagement, the same slide helps me gtfo of there.
---
The thing looks like the oculory from Skyrim
---
what planet are these strikes?
---
\*happy cosmodrome noises\*
---
Alright guy, you do you
---
Adventure. Or heroic story mission, can't recall which exactly. But you're researching the presence of the cabal in the area.
---
#Yup. This pirate claster picked up wrong fight.
---
How do you find squads in solo comp?
---
I am not. I am a moderator of the discord he created  to get the community involved with the book. I was asked to charge the link around to bring in those who want to participate.
---
you gotta watch out for that fur ball attack
---
Yea I‚Äôll play, add me TheMuff1nMan37 I‚Äôm on Xbox at 3000
---
Jelly-filled Thrall.
---
That‚Äôs what my friends and I like to call ‚Äúbullshitery.‚Äù
---
Oryx is back?
---
Mountaintop/recluse can be run on any class and is in no way reliant on being run as a titan with OEM.
---
And Saitama
---
Do an big spinny
---
Glad I wasn‚Äôt the only one.
---
I did get 3 exotics from doing 750 for the lul though. Once again it's down to the roll of the dice...
---
Do it
---
The acolyte being blinded after looks so sarcastic haha
---
Is Randy‚Äôs Throwing Knife so good that it is worth doing this quest?  Seems pretty crazy.
---
To add on to this you need a perfect chalice to access the catalyst.  Perfect chalice is basically just having all the perks on locked the bottom of the chalice.
---
Yea it‚Äôs takes a while to complete but it‚Äôs for sure worth
---
Quite an old repost you got there, didn't handle the compression too well.
---
Zealots reward can get like 20 meter ohk its somehow more retardly broken.

"Chexk your internet" "calm down" the most useless and brain dead reaponse you can out online dude. Lemme walk you through our quick convo. I specifically say i know my xbox has good connection. And your response i "check your xbox connection" now who is the child ignoring relevant info to suggest a "fix" ive already checked. And stated ive checked.
---
Yah I can agree with this I‚Äôve always hated that I‚Äôm so limited going into nightfall.
---
bro he's trying his best
---
uh...alright. I just clicked on the middle right icon that said "survive" after going into the crucible menu. I'll look for the "freelance" thing. Thank you.
---
No. Just no.
---
No, you can‚Äôt make me, mom
---
I already called the cops. OP has definitively been spying on my life.
---
*warlocks getting nerfed to uselessness*
---
Good job!
---
Yes
---
 Yup. This pirate claster picked up wrong fight.
---
That only one shots if all pellets hit...
---
You do get scores in regular strikes, just not very much.
---
I‚Äôve been looking to play with someone too I got Sunday Monday and Tuesday off hit me up my gamer tag is Simplyevolved
---
Explosive trash!

I mean to split hairs, pluperfect is an action in the past that is further past than just the perfect - your example is fine though
---
Croc Inspiration

Funniest thing I‚Äôve seen all day!
---
I use minimum distance and rat king frequently
---
He was givin it hell though!
---
Everything I said was factually correct.
---
 I‚Äôm only mucking about. Relax. As for what‚Äôs in the canister. It‚Äôs best you don‚Äôt ask.
---
I would also like that as well
---
Thanks. I really am happy about this
---
I'm grinding for Izanagi's Burden catalyst, and I need a lot of Imperials to max out my chalice. Do I still need to upgrade the 2 other slots (5000 Imperials), or will it count as maxed if I just focus on the bottom 9 perks and use the 5000 Imperials for the said perks instead of the slots?
---
This is really true and I can‚Äôt believe that they added Shrek‚Äôs  family into Destiny
---
I too would also like that as well.
---
I thought you were in the nexus strike or something from D1
---
that guy is a fucking tenno haha
---
Hell yeah. Zavala needs some love with all the shit he has to put up with constantly.
---
"Alright I'll go lef..."
---
*Guardian Down.
---
"Come on Trevor not again!!"
---
It's also got a much better ammo economy than izanagis, but also a lower margin of error since its many more shots
---
Trying to format this on my phone turned out not to work.  Each category was supposed to be separate lines.*  If the research I did on line is still true for shadow keep then here is my reasoning for the build.  Armor with the void affinity allows us to use mods that benefit grenade launchers such as scavenger, ammo finder, reloader, unflinching, and dexterity (for the grenade launchers) which will ensure we never run out of ammo and have the best possible performance. Top tree dawn blade lets us fire weapons and thorough grenades while gliding. This will allow us to fire off our grenade launchers from a safe distance. In addition to this, getting a kill while airborne restores part of your grenade and melee energy and a casting your super fully recharges grenade and melee energy. If you use the Sun bracers exotic gloves it doubles the duration of your solar grenade from 4 seconds to 8 seconds and if you get a melee kill you get  5 seconds to throw an unlimited amount of solar grenades. However I do believe these do not stack so throwing all of them on the boss won't do any more damage than just one.  If we try to use the star fire protocol exotic chest, it gives us in additional fusion grenade charge and makes fusion grenades charge faster. It also seems to have the added benefit that grenade kills grant rift energy.  As for the grenade launchers themselves, the mountain top uses green ammo, the fighting lion uses white ammo, and is the only grenade launcher in the game to do so,  and Wendigo / BA Grenade Launcher uses purple ammo so there will never be an ammo conflict.  On top of all of the different ways for us to obtain ammo and the fact that mountain top and fighting lion are not splitting ammo, we now have all 3 elements covered by grenades and we have the added bonus of a kinetic grenade

Just wasted an a ton of time doing the new dungeon with friends, got to the boss room, it was empty, proceed to disconnect, rejoin, disconnect, rinse and repeat. My internet is very good, and also one person in the party was my roommate 10 feet away. Ports are all forwarded, and NAT open for full party. The netcode for this game is indeed an absolute joke in 2019, as is most of the game.
---
Damn I wish my life requirements had a dog
---
I don't think it does, can you test it out? I'm curious to know if it will.
---
Thanks, I thought you‚Äôd appreciate it
---
Thank you! I know some of the perks and stuff but I guess I didn‚Äôt really get the whole concept.
---
Music was better when John Lennon was beating his wife
---
Thanks! I guess I didn‚Äôt really know what a god toll was so thank you for the explanation.

I guess I should pay more attention then! Thank you

Go to r/fireteam for a bigger chance of obtaining a team
---
Currently grinding hand cannon kills in Crucible for the Thorn quest. This gun better be fucking amazing or so help me god I will perma end myself with it. Every match is ~3 percent, and everyone has a Recluse.
---
Wish I were fucking joking about that last part- Turn a corner and there‚Äôs like 3 Recluses pointed at me. If it‚Äôs not them, it‚Äôs a scout rifle 3 miles away.
---
I too would also highly like that as well.
---
That was my post! I‚Äôm glad you were able to see my vision as well and put it into creation!
---
I‚Äôm not saying they aren‚Äôt broken but there are plenty of alternatives.
---
Won‚Äôt let me join or even access it. Been a reddit lurker for a long time, first time I‚Äôve signed up for an account cuz I need to finish this to go to bed :/
---
Your title sounds like a japanese dude saying Deathbringer
---
Just finished it again for my Burden. It's a fun one, haven't run the new one yet :(
---
Legends say his killer is still out there, hungry for his next prey that dares to say cursed word ‚Äúupdoot..
---
Survival? Or Quickplay?
---
...if you weren't using a scout when playing then yeah, you're gonna get the medals done before the scout kills.
---
Primary weapon medals give you something like 0.6%. It would take over 150 medals on a primary weapon to obtain the total medals needed. The scout rifle medal is "kill 5 enemies with precision damage at range in a single match", meaning assuming perfect play using only scouts you would still need a minimum of 750 kills with scouts to complete the medals part.
---
Choclate item (green from eva) then ads. Its Rng when it happens.
---
Hold up, i didn't say it was bad, I said it was a glass Cannon, which is true.
---
It's the only super without damage reduction, but it is really strong because it's a hit scan instakill. Just pointing out how in my 1000 hours in destiny, which i have played almost exclusively as a hunter, hunters don't always have the best supers.
---
Not talking about subclasses, just the super. Arcstrider is , in PvP at the very least, for all intents and purposes a weaker version of D2 striker. BB however is probably stronger than nova in my opinion. GG is unique in destiny, but I wish it weren't as situational, because it's the only super that actually puts you at a disadvantage if you panic and activate it, since it has no damage reduction, therefore it has to be used very situationally.
---
These are just my two cents, take them with a grain of salt.
---
Or you help a friend finish a raid cause a fire team member had to quest IRL. get 1 key and get 1K with said key.
---
Can say rest of the team was not happy as it was my 1st raid ever.
---
My Titan teammate used sunbreaker as tree  (don't know which one exactly) and Mountaintop + Recluse, Warlock mate was in Voidwalker if I recall correctly, can't remember which weapons exactly he used. I used Vigilance and Recluse whilst being Trapper on my Hunter. Everybody used a sword as heavy since you can burst most bosses down in under  30 secs with a sword on dmg and boss spec.
---
Sorry for the later answer, was sleeping
---
Unless you're DDoSing your teammates and deliberately losing, you will rank up.
---
You can literally AFK your way to 2100 now since you barely lose any points for a loss.

Unfortunately.
---
at least he wasn‚Äôt using sleeper simulant
---
Pick up oppressive darkness on your artifact mod and apply it to your class item. Spam discipline mods and enjoy throwing your void debuff grenades every 40-50 seconds and melting down whatever it happens to touch with whatever your best weapons are.
---
I haven't been playing destiny for personal reason, so take what I am saying as pre season of opulence, since that's when I stopped playing.
---
I heard striker is getting nerf, but didn't read too much about it because I am generally not keeping in the loop

that is just a lining, the genral construct is what were talking about.

I love portals
---
Nah thank you
---
Worth a shot lol
---
Yeah middle tree Nightstalker needs a nerf for sure. The wallhacks + the super duration is BS. Honestly it'd be nice if we could go back to D1 style where there were next to no roaming supers. I'd even eat a GG nerf if we could just remove the fucking things completely.
---
Cayde would say otherwise
---
Is Revoker good in PvE? I've heard people say it's irrelevant, but does that mean it's just outclassed, or is it useless? I love the look, and with my horrible aim the perk will help I assume
---
So the Cryptarch giving out Kanye Krocs now? Cool.
---
As a dredgen I agree

I dont want to take the light!

In all seriousness, don‚Äôt feel bad about not going. Sure lots of people remember their formal. But what you will remember most is what makes you happy. If destiny is what makes you happy then go for it. Hope you got that +50!
---
Oh dude I feel your pain. I got 4 capes in a row. Was about to go to bed last night but decided to farm out one more frame and finally got the piece I needed. Almost shouted with joy and ended up staying awake another 3 hours to finish the quest and get the catalyst.
---
Wait till you try planting a full clip of prospector shots in a circle around you when doing this. My clanmate planted the banner in the roof in the Riven room

One of the quest steps is doing the bergusia forge to get the final key this forge rotates daily, however the final step needs you to go to a quest location on EDZ which manually takes you to a special version of the bergusia forge
---
I will literally buy the expansion for this gun complete with relevant firing / reloading sound
---
Yes. Up until 950 (without the artifact) then you would want to focus on pinnacle gear.
---
Beat me to it
---
You see these banners are more than just things you can purchase for legendary shards. These banners come from somewhere dark. They require blood sacrifices. Most come from all those who died in raids but sometimes you can see one being made right before your eyes.
---
They used to kidnap ordinary villagers and kill them to make banners originally, but then we remembered ‚Äúoh shit, hey! We resurrect. Maybe we should just use guardians from now on.
---
But why would you put the bubble around the rally barricade? Wouldnt putting it next to or behind the rally barricade be better? I mean im guessing theres a lack of communication so that makes sense
---
you could get to 950 power level even with only the free version of the game , yes black armory come with frosaken

thanks!

Reason not to do gambit without a fireteam, I usually have the same problem.. with prime evil damage above 50%

If you‚Äôre talking about the triumph, buy the consumable from Eva, then go in the forest, use the consumable and start shooting to get the triumph.
---
Most of the armor sets aren‚Äôt too big of a deal, apart from Invader.
---
Reaper armor helps with all around enemy clearing, but isn‚Äôt necessary.
---
Sentry is ok, but it promotes sitting around the bank, which is never a good thing. Invader marking doesn‚Äôt work very well either.
---
Despite how much I love sending 20 more blockers and listening to Drifter lose his shit, wearing collector armor basically paints a massive target on your back.
---
The Invader set is stupid good. You get free special and primary ammo while invading, enough health to take a sniper shot to the dome and live, the ability to lock and steal motes from the enemy team‚Äôs bank, and a damage buff after returning to your side. It‚Äôs pretty nuts.
---
But the price of crocs in general is that youre wearing crocs and thats a thought you have to live with for the rest of your life. Which is too expensive.
---
Damn, now you only have 1

He had a barricade down first, you bubbled on him. I'd call that bad bubble placement on your part. It could have been placed a few feet behind everyone to dip in and out of.

I‚Äôm not comfortable with the idea that anyone can record the stupid stuff I do on D2 while I learn the ropes...

Yea ngl, it sucks. ._. i just wanna have fun lmfao, then again it‚Äôs crucible so idk what i expected.

Hey. Give me my recluse back, asshole

Like really though, titans have a 1 shot melee, hunters have a throwing knife and warlocks have a high five

It basically does less than half the damage per ammo with heavy, compared to izanagi with energy and ca't crit due to working like a explosion without a projectile impact.

Check out esoterikk and ehroar on youtube.
---
It's not even bad, idk what all of you people are talking about. Yes it's clumsy to use and the ammo is really low at 30 rounds but if you use it like a scout or a sniper, this weapon does high amounts of damage. Good to know that it's getting even better though.

At 906 he could join up until 920 Nightfalls (it will be difficult, but it's still easier for him than doing 980s is for me at 965), but he definitely should not be soloing them yet.

Okay thanks, i dont have ps plus so i probably cant do the challenges (because you need ps plus for gambit, crucible, strikes etc.). But still thanks for answering.

Not to mention I hate how Ana feels like she contributed when her shitty fucking Lance isn't even required other than to throw in the forge to "make a new, better one"
---
TL;DR: fuck WotT and fuck Ana Brey
---
I^(ndeed)
---
It's just a very non-intuitive super.  I played warlock &amp; hunter before ever touching a titan build and didn't understand why people insisted it was good.  Never played D1 so maybe it's just that.
---
Inside the bubble = good, that I get.  Bubble-dance in and out for more damage... not so much.  The visual bubble area is even more well defined than Well of Radiance, so why would I assume anything happens by leaving it?
---
To be fair, this is a shitty feature in PvE and you would probably see more bubble Titans instead of bottom tree OEM Strikers in PvP if it just increased incoming damage resistance but allowed outgoing projectiles. I know they're following the current "no support classes" game design philosophy, but they've managed to create an area denial class that denies area to its own team.
---
I assume this is rubber banding from network issues.
---
Correct
---
I'm at the step where I must do a maximum temper Bergusia forge session, but i don't have any prompt to start the forge from the map. I went there and there is still no prompt  to start it. What can I do?
---
You just know he's saying "Yaaaassss queen"
---
Guess they're nightmares now
---
You're the only one that played D1 I see. Saint-14 bless you for remembering the old ways
---
I honestly thought he was just transcending..
---
Thanks I'll try posting a ticket there
---
It‚Äôs harder for some
---
To be fair, all the VO (which was a LOT for the triumphs) and other endgame stuff I've played this season with randoms, I think only a handful of times someone put up bubble. I don't think people realize SK drop it got the biggest damage buff...that, or all Titans just want to DPS.
---
That makes a lot more sense than my thoughts
---
f2p has access to **many** very, very good guns. Most of the most popular PvP weapons are accessible without paying and only require the time invested to grinding for a god-roll of it. 
---
Like most PvP Shooters, map-awareness and aim are the two most critical elements to success in Destiny 2's Crucible.
---
I hate people use bubble Like this, i can understand why He shoot into the bubble
---
Freelance is harder for me
---
I like to kill him with the whisper. I like the irony about it
---
Those colours look like Wisp from Warframe
---
That is indeed a pimp slap
---
Okay real talk warlocks need a buff. The nerf to Luna boots completely threw them into irrelevance in pve and they literally only have handheld supernova to keep them afloat in pvp. I loved playing my warlock but now I just feel like I'm bogging my raid team down whenever I hop on mine. The *only* thing warlocks have is survivability, which is rediculously situational to immortal space people
---
No team utility, laughable damage boosts, barely any crowd control - warlocks need some serious work unless bungie for some reason wants them to be something of a tank class in a game where the trinity really doesn't apply
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm right‚Äù
---
That is a confirmed bug, yes. It shouldn't happen in other crucible modes.
---
[removed]
---
I mean you popped the bobble right on the rally barricade, it‚Äôs a pretty bad spot to put the bubble.
---
He a little confused but he got the spirit
---
There‚Äôs just always a gun that does what side arms do better then sidearms.
---
I'm 19 I don't understand it dw, I use the party chat on console
---
Wether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with Yeezy.
---
Had a kid pull this on a flawless run, I was not impressed...
---
You get whatever the **current season** is when you buy Shadowkeep. I would 100% recommend just waiting to pick up Shadowkeep at the beginning of next season if you want to maximize your value. You won't get the Leviathan's Breath heavy bow if you don't have this season, but other than that none of the Seasonal Weapons are like a "must have" or anything (and even Leviathan's Breath is outclassed by many other exotics).
---
iirc you have to unlock it from the modifications part in your inventory in order to use it, if it's not there, I have no idea where they went.
---
Have u activated it already? aka opened the package for it
---
Lmao
---
Nope , where would I get that?
---
You may say I'm a dreamer.
---
Very true.  If that's the case and you are unable to solo the dungeon, I would recommend using the fireteams section in the companion app to find help to run the dungeon.  I saw people posting for Izanagi's Burden dungeon run earlier today.
---
oh my fucking god just use LFG, you don't need to talk to anyone if you don't want to. really, it's ok! 
---
It's literally full of solo players helping each other out, and the more people do it the better it gets.
---
if you still need instructions, this should be foolproof:
---
open destiny 2
---
you can be in orbit or literally anywhere else, orbit is easier tho
---
open internet browser
---
go to:  [https://www.bungie.net/en/ClanV2/FireteamSearch](https://www.bungie.net/en/ClanV2/FireteamSearch) 
---
check if the thing you wanna do has an open fireteam
---
if there is an open one click on it: 
---
 q- each member in the fireteam will have a long ass ID: number next to his name, copy that number
---
\- go back to your game and open chat by pressing the enter key on your keyboard
---
\- type in: /join 
---
\- don't press enter
---
\- press control+v on your keyboard (this is gonna copy the id number from LFG)
---
\- Press enter and enjoy
---
if there is no open fireteam:
---
 \- join a random fireteam you don't actually want to play with (please leave it afterwards)
---
 \- your id number is gonna be displayed next to your name like with anyone else, copy it
---
 \- leave the random fireteam and create your own, new fireteam. 
---
 \- put in the appropriate parameters for how many ppl you need and which category of activity you wanna do
---
 \- most important thing tho is the name
---
 \- short and precise, followed by /join and YOUR OWN id number you copied from the random fireteam.
---
 \- like: "Shattered Throne /join 123456789"
---
 \- go back to your game and start activity or wait for players in orbit, it usually takes less than 2 minutes for your fireteam to fill up for any non-raid activity.
---
Seems to be the spot for this to happen.
---
Well nothing is there so ummm
---
Keep in mind that in all likelihood the max power level will increase every season (it has every time in the past, but it's not like confirmed or anything) so the pinnacle grind might well be irrelevant when the next season starts. That grind is really mostly around for the hard-core players who raid every week.
---
Yup, that‚Äôs right. Must be different frames in the same week. Doing the same frame twice in the same week might not count towards your progress.
---
Can agree 10/10 would like to see
---
love the D2 community
---
In certain ways yes, but in neutral game and supers warlocks have it a bit worse. The only things really running for us are handheld supernova and tracking dawnblade.
---
The feels
---
ILL TAKE YOUR ENTIRE STOCK
---
Keep it up! Don't let people who post this kind of stuff discourage you
---
Looks better on my opinion
---
I‚Äôd say it was a stupid bubble placement...
---
Check your consumable inventory for the package, open it, then in the mod inventory unlock the items.
---
Ah, I see that you are a Man of Thundercrash as well.
---
we all appreciate your contribution.
---
That's different. You at least become famous that way
---
Me af. Just hit 65. 32 levels to go for the full Phenotype Plasticity ornament set üò´
---
‚ÄúIncreased non crit damage dealt to red health bar enemies by 0.001%‚Äù
---
To me it‚Äôs a good 6/10 because the thing‚Äôs saved my ass in crucible more times than I can count, but when I‚Äôm in PVE it‚Äôs meh
---
I feel you man
---
I played Episode 1 and 2 on the gamecube online for years. Then played Universe the entire time it was active. And now you can download clients for Phantasy Star Online Blue Burst which is the pc version and play online there. There are still about 1000 on the server I played on. Feels just as good now as it did then. 
---
Maybe I don't see anything similar due to the stupid amount of time I put into PSO. Don't get me wrong, both are great games though.
---
Earth's hunted
---
Sad to say I failed this vibe check
---
...
---
You have just opened my eyes.
---
titans have killed him with shoulder charging so...
---
I think mag size is only like 13. It‚Äôs even worse. It does explosive damage but not large enough to take out groups of enemies unless they‚Äôre all standing right non top of each other. Plus thunderlord does more damage per second and has more ammo and is better at dealing with trash mobs. Xenophage can‚Äôt do anything lol. It doesn‚Äôt even crit.
---
Ggs man, what class were you running?
---
It's vex offensive
---
Awoken warlock that I made in d1. Well all my toons are from d1 lol
---
He's a little confused, but he got the spirit
---
Saved and upvoted, thank you much
---
People complained the pinnacle weapons were too strong now they complain the ritual weapons are too weak.
---
Try doing the GoS final raid boss on console
---
Resistance is futile
---
lol
---
Thundercrashing stinky werm in 3‚Ä¶ 2‚Ä¶ 1
---
I push all my boys off of everything. Oh you made it through the jumping puzzle in a raid *shoulder charge* oh you're killing the knight in the pit of heresy *shoulder charge* they get me back though when I play on my hunter or lock
---
Everyone and their brother has the Dredgen seal. It‚Äôs statistically the easiest one to get. Unless you‚Äôre at a massive light disadvantage then you‚Äôre not getting 2 tapped. The weapon can‚Äôt even crit. And it holds so little ammo that truth is better and more reliable. I‚Äôve never been killed by someone using xenophage.
---
God you all suck. There is an obvious and easy counter to OEM titans. Just dont shoot them.
---
While I can see more than a few similar elements, the "techniques" (magic) used in PSO were simpler while being more robust and were not limited by class until the later versions. I have seen bosses use things that remind me of PSO periodically (don't even try to tell me The Rootmind didn't just try to hit me with Megid!), but overall Destiny has better combat mechanics by far compared to PSO's quasi-turn-based setup. Realistically, we probably wouldn't have the Destiny series without PSO blazing the trail.
---
The transmat effects should be longer. They are so short that I never get to see them
---
It's not what it was in D1
---
devourlock with double breach refractor and taken armaments, deathbringer is nasty as hell, incoming invader? shoot the floor, enemy team ganging up on you, shoot the floor again.
---
At 38, I kinda like being solo.
---
Well I forgot to add ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù
---
I‚Äôm grinding for the shadow pins

Ah i see

Very true with the final statement. That game opened a lot more doors than most people think.

---
Does it came out from his ball???
---
*zavala makes another tally*
---
I miss the limbo nuke. The bubble itself doesn't seem all that useful anymore, but when you could do some decent damage with the nuke he was a lot of fun.
---
To add, the Bug Out Bag from Gambit helped me through some tricky times.
---
That skins shit. What hsppened to the design team for weapons and armour in d1. Shit looked way better back then.
---
Is it because the cabal attacked and suddenly the design team stopped caring?
---
That is squared with geomagnetic boots
---
I didn‚Äôt think about that, it‚Äôs beautiful. I usually run hunter with liar‚Äôs handshake + one two punch shotty and thunder coil. Very reliable in solo que when you can almost kill the primeval on your own xD
---
I agree but when u put the bubble in the back or on the side no one uses it
---
Oh yes just ban all guns that people earned or armor you think is busted. If that‚Äôs the case I want handheld supernova and stompees banned. I‚Äôll use skull fort for incite shoulder charges and still pull 3 kds
---
Nothing is more fun than watching blueberries get one shot by a shoulder charged chest lmao
---
Shit up?
---
Still thinking this is a fair fight?
---
Ill throw my knife into that silly little pea brain real smooth like, maybe even chuck a 360
---
Tbh no point in even trying to talk to anyone because they either tell you to shut up or dont talk at all. All i say is "hey anybody want to do a nightfall or something" i just sit there like what the fuck did i do to hurt you im just trying to talk with someone and chill like what the fuck
---
You're both correct. Read the lore.
---
I will literally pop novawarp and make you cry.
---
Spend it.   It‚Äôs will ‚Äúgo bad‚Äù in your inventory if you don‚Äôt.
---
Spend it
---
You know, somehow after all these weeks of Shadowkeep and the hours I've put into it, I've yet to get a single ammo finder or traction mod. I've got every enhanced weapon perk under the sun but not basic mods like finders and traction lol
---
Trevor the lost little puppy
---
Same boat here, I just kinda gave up trying to communicate in strikes and just attempt to keep up, I suppose it does get a bit hectic to type, especially if there is a timer and lots of angry dudes.
---
Getting killed by my own finisher is funny. But theres some cases like that sucks
---
People have been saying this for a few months now and it still hasn't been nerfed
---
Omae wa mou shindeiru
---
I put in many, *many* hours into D1 and D2 on xbox. Recently I moved to D2 on PC and in about 3 weeks, I have some 276 hours or so.
---
The Hunter is bungie's favorite but doesn't it have the worst class ability in the dodge? The only class ability that doesn't help your team in any way...
---
Not really...I've been booted from 2 clans with no warning or even a message saying I was being removed. Just logged in one day and was clanless and all those people unfriended me.
---
Seriously, gaming communities can be brutal sometimes. I don't mind playing alone but there's tons of content I just am unable to do because of people that are dicks.
---
Ah ok. Was there candy last year? Didn't play then
---
I don't think I've ever seen that map pop up in rotation. Is this a different game mode than normal control? Or did Bungie pull it from rotation?
---
GET IN THERE AND FIGHT, GUARDIAN!
---
I'm just thinking about a person's first crucible game and this happening to them
---
Ironically if the Titan kept sprinting in front of his mate (and not pushed him) then he would draw the opponents reticle off his mate and let his mate easily return fire uncontested. It‚Äôs a viable tactic pre-made teams (of higher than average PvP skill/knowledge) use often. 
---
At least on console since AA=sticky cross hairs.
---
Got me there.
---
Can we also make supremacy it‚Äôs own playlist so I can just play clash? That would be great.
---
Izanami and Volundr didn't work for me. :sad warbeast noises: Bergusia did a couple of days ago.
---
I believe that trick works for Titans and Hunters. Is fellow Warlocks get boned in this one.
---
Local chat is opt in. Most people do not opt in.
---
hello guys, is there a way to be notified with phone notifications (kinda like RSS) whenever the exotic vendor appears? (this guy: [https://youtu.be/e0wx5emZzFc?t=250](https://youtu.be/e0wx5emZzFc?t=250)). Along with his location and so on
---
They shouldn‚Äôt change the damage just the ammo. In gambit when you are invading it‚Äôs actually quite a good weapon since it can 2 shot from anywhere and there‚Äôs loads of heavy ammo.
---
HIVE, BRING A SWORD
---
On the page you have linked, whisper is lower DPS than darci.  What's with the whisper worship?  The total damage makes sense with the extra ammo but it isn't too DPS, and what I said about prospector is still absolutely true
---
Dude, you need to totally look both ways before you...
---
You keep that bravado until I start running in your direction as a titan
---
SNITCH
---
I would too. I've shoulder charged friends who were taking too long in the bathroom from one raid encounter to the next
---
9am PST, 10am PDT
---
Hopefully they don't do this when you're trying to grind lol
---
Wheres the "ok boomer" comment? Just when you think reddit is predictable...
---
Yeah you could, but it's rather inaccurate and impractical. You'd always have to move your pen from one side to another if you wanna turn.
---
Indubitably
---
Make sure to look for posts that say "be chill", they tend to lead to a better experience and, in my experience, usually leads to adding those people to play with in the future.
---
It‚Äôs the speed that‚Äôs the real killer though, we can‚Äôt melee as fast with or without our ability active so if a warlock and titan punch each other at the same time the titan will always win if both try and punch again.
---
That titan didnt have G O O D B O N E S T R U C T U R E
---
With a belt-feeding mechanism for some reason. Like, they couldn't fit 13 rounds into a magazine so they opted for a belt feeder.
---
I don‚Äôt have that great of knowledge of that stuff? I really did just made it up.
---
DING
---
I got triple tap and Explosive on mine
---
Popular vote in ‚Äòmurrica*
---
Yes yes, now it will get beaten to a pulp because it‚Äôs good in gambit ~Sleeper cries in the corner~
---
Hope and pray. Seriously. I‚Äôve turned in 30 and haven‚Äôt gotten anything. Apparently it is a really low drop rate. Eyes up guardian.
---
Yeah you're absolutely right here, the speed makes absolutely no sense anymore. I was more just commenting on the "shorter lunge range" bit
---
It‚Äôs been in the game since D1.
---
Ghosts can only be killed with weapons of sorrow.  Sorry for he confusion
---
Which would still be zero, since it's entirely explosive damage.
---
It's called equinox and it's still in rotation but tbh be glad you haven't played it as it's not a great map imo
---
I‚Äôve been playing solo since destiny 1 first came out but I don‚Äôt wanna flex
---
I asked in the Destiny discord for like a week for a group for crucible, that one is difficult to find. Eventually a rando very nice person grouped with me and helped me climb to Fabled faster for my recluse and Randy's. I now have both.
---
I then proceed to Nova Bomb your characters code to deletion.
---
Oh right. Thanks!
---
I hate daylight saving time, ugh.
---
Their titan brains only know how to shoulder charge not when so nothing stops them really
---
But how does merciless play in pvp?
---
Yay ! another one.
---
All about the timing.  If you were pulling out Gally for the final event you had to make sure that cool down was timed appropriately :)
---
Check out the [New Player's guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/dbw0jp/the_destiny_2_new_players_guide_faq/) as a starting point, and as you play the game you'll start learning what these mean as you go. Destiny 2 is a big game with a lot of activities, and this post is just my attempt to consolidate the weekly news and rotations for activities/rewards.
---
If you have any questions about anything specific we can try to help, but answering what all of the pieces of the post means would be a lengthy process.
---
Hope that helps, and welcome to the game Guardian!
---
Actually not too bad it helps to have the catalyst tho
---
Need a clan?
---
Recluse is just so good because of anti-barrier rounds in PvE. With double breach refractor, it's too good to pass up. You could use a demolitionist SMG like Optative, though.
---
C. I am the one and only god here
---
Honnestly, if i had a fireteam i wouldnt care if theyre not that good a long as i have someone to play with is enough for me
---
In game communication is a joke in this game. When i play cod, rust, apex, pubg everyone has a mic, but for some reason no one playing destiny have one.
---
In wow i can gather a 25man raid or 5 man group with the local and global chat easily (somewhat) but in destiny everyone is literally blind.
---
yes, but only to you.  The rest of us can access it directly from the map.  ü§£
---
Lol at a point in time is used to be that a loss dropped you 68 points and your first and second win only netted you 40 and 60 points respectively. That meant if you couldn't get on a win streak going you'd slowly bleed points even if you did have a 50/50 win loss ratio. Albeit that was at mythic onwards I believe but even on the way to fabled it would be like 80 for a win, 60 a loss (or 60 for a win and -40 for a loss, one of the two). Last season I had to be carried.. TO FABLED! This season I'm halfway between mythic 2 and 3!
---
go google some Reddit posts about this made when Forsaken just came out.  they are hilarious
---
Main question is, why the Last Word on Equinox
---
All SMGs can do Recluse's level of damage. The difference is that recluse has a strong bodyshot multiplier when MoA is procced, so you don't need to actually land precision hits. At the end of the day SMGs are overtuned or other primaries are too weak.
---
True but if you play crucible as a sweating tryhard its better with a fireteam for communication
---
Like, I've soloed almost all the ones in new light, but I struggled with that one
---
You‚Äôre a good man, thank you.
---
I feel this lol 
---
I enjoy my Every Waking Moment sub
---
Oh damn lol 
---
Well no worries üëçüëå
---
Because its fun
---
The most power fantasy thing a hunter has is his super. So try to max your Intelligence stat (you can get up to 50 points from armor mods. The rest has to come from your base armor stats. Intelligence reduces super charge time), masterwork a weapon (masterworked weapons drop small super orbs when you get multikills, so you get your ult  ack faster), and try to get an exotic that boosts your super (such as Orpheus Rig) or ability charge rate (such as frostees).
---
Alternatively get high recilience and mobility, take the melee recharging dodge and top or bottom arc tree. Liar's Handshake recommended. Enjoy playing a Titan for a bit.
---
I can't believe Bungie's solution to things like this is to just kill the player. 
---
Oh, the enemy died before you could use a finisher? Guess I'll die.
---
Then replace the d and they are bed bugs
---
Just LFG anyway, but say you mic is broken or something. Some people might require mics (normally in raids) but outside of raids most people dont care. I've done the 850/980 Nightfall or 980 Nightmare hunts plenty of times now where some doesnt have a mic and it didn't matter to me cuz those modes are matchmade so as long as you help IDC if you talk
---
Hunters, amirite?
---
Know the feeling :/
---
I got it killing enemies on the moon randomly. Did have the consumable for strange chocolate coins on.
---
When my man did this I switched to invis hunter and ditched him at opportune moments.  (He is a warlock but they could slap you into a week in the future in D1)
---
Hold my Mountaintop I'm going in ._.
---
Every guardian has died for the last city but how they died is different than what Zavala has imagined
---
*laughs in sleeper simulant*
---
Im in this photo and I don't like it.
---
Literally every warlock I run into is broken as shit so I understand why lol
---
Idk I climbed to 5500 solo
---
But youre so limited on what you can do
---
Titan plus monte carlo = god tier
---
Heck, join our clan if you want. We are always looking for new players. We raid and do other stuff regularly on Xbox1 and ps4. We are trying to build our PC player count. We have fun here in the ‚Äúhomeless bros‚Äù clan
---
People are capable of reading; it's just easy to misunderstand what you were saying, and when you reply with just "You're dumb; re-read my comment." it comes off as you being pretty venomous, you know?
---
It would be nice if we could get matchmaking on harder Nightfalls and Harder Haunts. It‚Äôs not like we don‚Äôt already know the mechanics of the missions like in a raid.
---
I usually don‚Äôt care because accidents happen and I usually get my super back pretty fast with the geomags but it really did seem intentional cause like.. how do you miss that giant stream of electricity?!
---
Lmao nvm she's got this
---
Enhancement cores. I gotten 1, 3, and up to 5. Other than that just legendary gear.

HMGs aren't exactly that good for DPS. It's less that SMGs compare to heavies and moreso that HMGs compare to primaries.

Oh, thanks. I was about to give up on grinding for them.

That shit always makes me laugh. Raid been out for 5 weeks? Better have 16 clears. One for each character and an extra one cause fuck you
---
have one, but its europe based :(
---
Just LFG. Sure, some people are rude, but there are plenty of people that don't mind playing with randoms and teaching because they are alone too. I am mostly solo, so I LFG everyday so I can do raids/master nightfalls/etc

I mean its an MMO. Its not made to be 100% solod
---
Tried finding a clan on pc multiple times, never really found one that wasnt gigantic and in those its hard to join in the already "pre made groups"
---
Your substance is that warlock melee speed is slower which means they will lose head to hand punch fights and can't run a shotty-punch loadout as effectively
---
The warlock roaming supers also have a higher TTK than the other 2 classes
---
There's not much arguing with math
---
Isn‚Äôt that close to what it is though? Currently you buy each level to 100-200 silver. It‚Äôs an option in the bottom right

The out of game resources such as r/fireteams and the companion app for your phone are much better for finding groups. Having said that, if you lack a fireteam for anything don't hesitate to send me a message!

I suggest using the Destiny app, it's great for meeting new people

---
what you can buy tiers? I didn't even notice.

I feel you. Been like that since Destiny 1 day one. So I made it my aim to solo everything except stuff that have mechanics requiring multiple players.

I mean tbf handheld is pretty sick and their grenades in general are filthy.  I think shitty melee lock and range is just a problem in general.  Besides Titans actually.
---
ah okay. I guess I shouldnt have a problem I've only got a few.
---
Thanks.
---
The right thing.
---
are you saying that raids should have matchmaking?
---
also lfgs are definitely not the same thing as matchmaking. they let you pick your teammates, which is a really important feature in a raid where you‚Äôd want everyone to have a mic
---
Neither do i!
---
I said high rewards. Lost sectors don't give high rewards
---
The fact you have to go outside of the game just to match make is the worst part of destiny for me. I put more effort and time into finding a fireteam via LFG then i ever have running a strike. It makes no sense to me
---
You got outplayed hard!
---
&gt;Its the exactly same thing as matchmaking but slower and worse.
---
A randomly matched group would make zero progress in a raid.  There are different strats for a lot of rooms, if someone has to leave how are you supposed to ensure that the person who comes in has the knowledge and the ability to play the role you need?
---
The bottom line is that raids are a completely different animal than the rest of the game.  Are you really suggesting that the only thing stopping players from taking on a 2-4 hour commitment, complicated puzzles that require constant communication (while dealing with an onslaught of adds), and massive amounts of frustration is that Bungie hasn't implemented a system into their game that would essentially need to be a duplicate of existing LFG systems?
---
Its happened to me a few times in the pit of hearsay, it‚Äôs quite annoying.
---
Raids need matchmaking
---
I can help you with it sometime if you want, I can even Sherpa most of it. Dm me if you want to sometime, it‚Äôs my favorite raid.

I play solo a lot, but im always down to play with people. I'm on cst, and am usually on anywhere form late night to early evenings, and days.
---
I hear it's possible to get Ascendant Shards from them once in a blue moon
---
My husband and a friend of his used to play, but they haven't played in practically a year, so I've been lone wolf playing since. I have a few people leftover from when I did the first raid in year 1 but one really good one of them who at some point asked if I wanted to join his clan seems to have dropped off the face of the planet completely. I'm even more hesitant to look because I'M A GURL who's in her 30s, and I've had to deal with a handful of awkward 20-something year old dudes who can't take a fucking hint. */Sighs heavily*
---
Thank you, people think I'm nuts for thinking this. Especially the fact that most titans just straightline, making it all the more hilarious when you drop them
---
Oh, wow. They have a lot more good stuff than I thought.
---
That'd make more sense but be equally stupid.
---
Indeed
---
Works scarily well with lord of wolves.
---
Thats rough.
---
First off, no hunters don't get full health off dodge with wormhusk arc battery. Second, once this season is over wormhusk goes back to being shit and OEM is still stronger because there is no dependency on building around a specific mod for it to work in any sort of advantageous way. Maybe dont play hyper aggressive until you proc OEM.
---
Actually I gotta disagree I found my self climbing rank faster going into normal survivor and getting teamed with a 2 stack rather then 3 randoms probably cause newer players chasing pinnacles think it‚Äôs easier in free lance
---
Should note that this also goes for if you successfully complete wave 7. If you start another round in a short amount of time, it will already be at wave 6. 
---
It used to be that you would have to restart after that but a glitch allowed people to continue at wave 6 even after beating the final boss. Instead of breaking something to fix it, bungie decided to make it so that this was always the case without needing to glitch it. 
---
Also, for loot at level 7, you can only open the chest with a key but that just drops the armour. The weapons will drop as an engram directly from the boss and are farmable without needing to open the chest. Drop rate is fairly low so you may need to farm for a while. That tends to confuse a lot of people.
---
Damn brother sorry to hear that. Gotta keep at melting those primevals though, Drifters hungry!

Just bad rng
---
I was a solo player until season of opulence when I decided to get a lot of stuff done,up until that I never had a raid clear
---
I see
---
I'm solo right now, grinding a few hours a night to 960, currently at 912. Is there a good clan to join?
---
In those he found a better hacker.
---
OP the punchy boi (titan) used his special (the bubble) and the guy standing in it was shooting at the bubble
---
This needs a version with the curb your enthusiasm theme over the top
---
yeah but its not really the responsibility of the developers to focus on making the solo experience more enjoyable in they massively multiplayer online game xD
---
I don't want this to be another retail WoW -.-
---
Is it still possible to get the Lord Shaxx mask?
---
I played as Krieg in Borderlands 2 with a friend. I changed that spec I had REAL fast.
---
Cold heart is my go to for boss killing since most bosses don‚Äôt move around a lot and cold heart gets better the more you are on target. It‚Äôs not that good in pvp though
---
His Stand has taken form!
---
Especially since bungie left activision I do not mind dropping a $20 here and there to support them.
---
That's what I'm trying to say. They all have their advantages and disadvantages.
---
Speaking of finishers, is there any way I can get golden age dropkick without silver?
---
Playing solo, ironically. Whisper, Zero Hour, and dungeons. We come full circle.
---
Lol yeah that sub is fucking garbage lol
---
And its cosmetics. I will spend money on cosmetics cause fun.
---
We could call ourselves the Lone Rangers!
---
Forever stuck in the purgatory that is finding a decent group... if yall got one or wanna start one add me on xbox IR HAWK x 96
---
Ah okay goood to know mate. Thank you.
---
I love how he's been making fun of his own intro recently.
---
Lol
---
No I was asking why they didn‚Äôt make panoptes a strike
---
I don‚Äôt have fighting lion or colony, grinded out most of the double kills with play of the game and got the orewings maul which I got way later doesn‚Äôt help much.
---
just shoot them in the face like all shoulder charging titans deserve
---
no, its base timer is longer than fists of havoc by 10 seconds.  Not taking into account FoH's now extremely minor extension on kill, or uniques that extend Spectral Blades.
---
Imagine losing...
---
You need gear power+900 to see flash point challenge
---
It ain't easy being ANY size group.
---
Solo: super difficult, coordination matters in many events.
---
Trio: Congrats, you can quest or strike together, but that's it
---
Quad: Crucible and Gambit. Take it or leave it.
---
Sextuple: RAID. But if you want to do anything else, you'll have to split up.
---
The worst part? There are 5 of us (total) in my weekly gaming group. Yay.
---
Smh I‚Äôm always late
---
This hurts
---
I fucking hate that if you finish a low health enemy and they kill it you kermit suicide
---
Seriously, the value transmission that Destiny offers is nearly unmatched in the AAA space.
---
Honestly tho, there's like no r34 of this game. Which I'm both proud of and disappointed by: I'm proud of the developers for creating so many amazing female characters that are interesting are in no way sexualized (that being said I don't think sexualizing and making characters attractive and appealing is wrong in any way, especially if it helps business) but I'm also disappointed bc, well, this game's adult content is nothing compared to other popular shooters live Overwatch....
---
No I'm not sure I've enabled chat. I know I can type in it, but I don't see any responses. I had no clue you had to enable anything to begin chatting, especially considering it appears as though the interface is working properly and everything just looks like I'm in a ghost town.
---
That and I‚Äôve also noticed some try to take on the unstoppable knight
---
You think I, a blueberry have time find out what's meta? Ha. My light burns bright and it burns blue I'll never get to branch 9 and if we get match made neither will you
---
Oh i dident notice that untill my 3rd watch
---
A true plot twist.
---
What spongebob is actually pointing and laughing at is the watermark.
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a new players thing, it‚Äôs just an intelligence thing.
---
I ran a few 980 NFs the other day on LFG and one of the guys was just oblivious to there being mods to stun unstoppable/overcharged/shielded enemies. Like he had no idea. Pretty sure he said he‚Äôs been playing since D1.
---
This is just one (I guess two) example(s).
---
haha true that
---
Go for it. Send me a message too so I don't accidently ignore you.
---
In pve ya it is really good and I don't actually think it s bad but you all ways have to reload after every kill in pvp
---
I have 51/53 scouts in the game. 52 if I go buy the last blue one when it‚Äôs on rotation. 
---
I should probably try some of these bad boys out
---
If an expansion is locked behind a paywall, then it's still b2p. It doesn't matter. Smh. If 100% of actual game content, excluding aesthetics is available, then it's f2p. 
---
I used to be a GM dude. Trust me, I get the f2p thing.
---
I'm one of the people who had no idea what to do in the raid but got it first try
---
You need 2100 in the survival playlist not Normal control
---
ok
---
If you don't have bad aim, in PvP you almost never have to reload, and it's a really consistent 3 burst, which is less than half it's mag
---
Oh ok. So you think its worth buying over shadowkeep?
---
Fucking typical
---
Thanks, it worked
---
I can understand pinnacle gear such as raid and iron banner armour not because they aren't supposed to be as easy to get and be something that you can show off
---
Already got it, just needed to restart
---
Forsaken includes the annual pass (Last 3 seasons). Shadowkeep includes this season's season pass.
---
Least favorite: Social system. As good as dead. I only had a conversation in the game chat only ONCE. It‚Äôs silent most of the time. You can‚Äôt just find a random stranger to team up or casually chat about something. I really wish there would be a voice chat system like in Rust, for example, where you can hear everyone talking near you.
---
Most favorite: Weapons and graphics. This is some high quality.
---
I feel like you're stretching a bit there my friend. The reason they do final blows, is simply to make sure its actually your kill, therefore you get the credit for it. There are so many enemies in the world, 10 enemies you kill isn't going to ruin the experience of a player because he can't finish his 10 kill bounty now. lol there are plenty of enemies for you both to get your kills. I'm absolutely certain getting 10 kills with your lmg isn't designed to make people play solo, it just wants you to get lmg kills.
---
Yes because forsaken gives you a lot more content NOW then Shadowkeep
---
The option that gives you the most control with bones was better directional, which testing was done that stompees does essentially the same thing except you jump slightly higher and slightly less far. You also get the bonus to sprint speed and slide distance. They‚Äôre way to similar to one another for bones to be brought back.
---
Lemme guess trapper hunter?
---
Hang in there bud. Moon is a good location to farm. Just grab Eris' extra bounties and go to a lost sector. They're very easy to complete. This is if you just want to purely farm for the exp. Usually completing five of those bounties, and given your rank. It should give you third of the bar if not near half. Weekly bounties are worth a lot so do those too. If you have a ghost shell with guiding light use it. If you got a mate, they can help by farming the bounties in a different lost sector and then turn it in perhaps when you're both back at Eris. As a few season ranks gives you fireteam exp, I never tried this myself but give that a go? The downside of this is the extra bounties will cost a bit of glimmer so stock up if you can. This is how I farmed exp when Shadowkeep launched. Let's just say I stopped needing to farm as hard about two weeks later.
---
Yeah i guess this is a smart solution. Maybe next time they change the way a game system like this change they also post it √Æn game, like idk an New line for ada when you go to her to check her inventory. I'm sure they post it on a twab somewhere, but i thought i had an issue not a feature.  Thanks for the reply.
---
Yeah. Glory. That's survival. You can't get past 2000 in Valor.
---
I really want Venus back as well as the D1 Mars.
---
you can use modulus reports to buy the same frame again until reset
---
ok ty
---
oh ok,so which one is worth to buy?
---
Loaded question with auto loading holster and reservoir burst is the only thing I use on this list. 
---
But I play PvE 80% of the time.
---
If you have another character you can use them on that character I believe .
---
I feel like the next DLC could tie all that into the story.
---
Love the color choices. You look awesome.
---
understandable, have a nice day
---
Exactly why I stopped playing.
---
Send me an invite when y'all make it üòÇ
---
PC for now. I have it for both just...
---
Seriously tho they need to make raids more accessible to people who don't have a ton of friends
---
Wrong subreddit my guy
---
the melee build with doomfang and bottom tree sentinel allows for effortless supers and big damage
---
r/lostredditors
---
Cayde called him gary in Trailer
---
Also Jez too
---
Umm... have you done a raid in destiny?
---
favourite part raiding with friends and clan mates worst part losing all interest because farming for roles sucks
---
That would be cool. If it still focuses on the Vex like all the speculations Venus could fit really well into the story arc.
---
What did you buy?
---
If u read the twab u would know
---
I would quite happily strangle a OEM titan and pierce through its eyes so hard like outta that GoT scene and then throw it in the incinerator and burn to hell for all I care. OEM's full of cancer ughh.
---
People crying in PVP about recluse making Bungie make it take a dip in PVE. Probably one of the most versatile weapons in that environment. Didn‚Äôt break encounters, didn‚Äôt trivialize them, and allowed you to have options elsewhere. Will wait to see the end result, I suspect it will feel the same as using something like subjunctive or calus mini tool that has a damage perk. Which works just fine. 
---
Still a little annoying though that clowns who can‚Äôt figure out how not to get destroyed by an SMG in crucible are making it take a hit everywhere.
---
Been solo since new light, will continue to solo. Ive only ever queued up with the fireteam finder for end game encounters. Will continue to solo.
---
No, only the Ballistic Log frames count. 
---
I have the same complaint as you. It's silly that you can only do two per week and that if you have one in progress during reset that it's eaten and the now useless Log is refunded. Just let me finish it, for pity's sake.
---
I've got to agree with the other dude. Maybe it depends on what region you're playing in? I don't know how they work it. But there's a fairly big problem with cheaters, this is based of my own experiences in the crucible. I stopped playing it not so long, I'd got to the point where it was pissing me off really bad.
---
How can I get thunderlord?Is it only possible by Xur now? Or are there other ways?
---
Last word and bray tech scout fucking best combo
---
I got the sniper running the Ordeal 750 an not even breaking 50K on pyramidion. Was first run as well. So yeah the drip rates are still there. An no never did it over 100K before. 
---
So the chances I would say are about the same. It's all RNG.
---
I just click the little pencil (I‚Äôm using mobile) and use the video camera to post this last one. :(
---
I hope that helps! Let me know how it goes.
---
Don't kill me but Warframe does MTX way better than Destiny does.
---
At least we have mountaintop... for now
---
At long last, the king has fallen. His crown shattered, and blade dulled. The recluse and OEM are no more. 
---
It‚Äôs about time.
---
Agreed OEM has had it coming, but for real Recluse did too IMO. Have you seen the usage stats on it? It's over 1/3 of all total kills in PVE and almost 50% of all Raid kills  [https://destinytracker.com/destiny-2/db/insights](https://destinytracker.com/destiny-2/db/insights)
---
I feel that comrade. It's a tough time for us loners.
---
This sounds like a lore entry from the way it's written, and I can just imagine my name is byf reading that.
---
I wouldn't say the weapon is bad, xenophage is a really solid weapon the only issue is that it doesint compete well against other exotic power weapons, honestly if they just buff the ammo reserves it will make xenophage a top tier weapon and there is also a catalyst for the weapon as well so depending on what the catalyst does it could make xenophage god tier.
---
It's been almost 7 months.
---
You could call it a clan!
---
Thank the lord its getting a nerf. Tired of getting looked at and losing half my half and damage.
---
i  love this idea
---
Pretty sure many would gladly fuck Ana Brey in your stead.
---
Yea but the problem with gambit prime when farming for spare rations is that gambit prime has a waaaaay larger lootpool than compared to t2 reckoning or t3 meaning you have less of a chance getting spare rations and more of a less of a chance of getting the roll you want running gambit prime compared to reckoning.
---
All the curated Forge weapons come with the shader as far as I can remember myself, so a good idea if you want to specifically get the shader you can try for the curated Blast Furnace since its curated roll isn't really that great anyways
---
As someone who loves playing solo, I'm just glad Warframe is *incredibly* solo-friendly. I wish Destiny was too but oh well. Not having an in-game LFG hurts too.
---
Just let me solo Strikes and all Nightfalls, Bungie. Let me take my time with missions instead of competing for kills with my teammates. Sigh.
---
im playing in eu but i have the feeling reporting them doesnt help at all maby they should implement a system how they have it in league of legends for years that you get an instant feedback report when a player is getting punished just to have the feeling they are doing something about it
---
Do you save the capture from the Xbox app and pull it from there?
---
This is one of the more puzzling aspects of this game. I‚Äôve got some sweet armor that I have to wear because the stats are way better, but I‚Äôd prefer to you know, have my IB armor look and feel.
---
You guys all talking about the knife and I‚Äôm over here wondering how you are playing comp with graviton lance
---
This is the best post I‚Äôve seen today. üòÇ
---
I literally just LOL"d  too funy. Bless them.
---
What is "normal comp" and "solo game mode" exactly?
---
Idk why people say this anymore. Just use the app
---
Ah yes the original guardian killer
---
Uldren is already dead. We already killed him.
---
His body is resurrected as a guardian without memories. 
---
Stop these senseless killing intentions.
---
You don't need friends to do raids or play destiny. This is a common misconception. Just go on bungie.net or find an LFG app and find randoms. It can be a little challenging or it can be fun and easy. It's awesome to meet new people and learn how to beat the encounters together. Eventually I shit you not after running say Val ca our on spire of stars you and the other guy know who's going up without saying a word to each other because you learned it that much.
---
All I wanna do is get exotics and do raids
---
I think you can‚Äôt get it anymore, but I‚Äôm not sure.
---
I said need but I meant want
---
Maybe you shouldn't play gambit if you know you have a shitty connection?
---
I known how you feel it took a little over 2 years for me to get a Halfdan-D.
---
Still waiting on a Mannanan Sr4 though :(
---
I got it üëç I tried doing video before instead of gif. Thanks üòä
