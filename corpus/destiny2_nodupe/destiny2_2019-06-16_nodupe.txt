That‚Äôs fair. I haven‚Äôt tried it in PvE yet. I‚Äôll have to see how it plays
---
---
---
Lol, why did the ghost shell drop
---
The second slot does not change perks, although it does affect RPM typically, which basically decides which weapon you'll get, just not which perks it will have.
---
Welcome to the family Guardian!
---
They cannot drop from normal menagerie, probably only heroic.
---
Poor bastard has the reckoner title
---
You aren't being serious......right?
---
Where's the other section
---
The only stupid question is the one that begins ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been away for 6 months and should I come back...‚Äù
---
are these posts no longer pinned to the top?
---
The only place to get them is Petra, you can buy them with either legendary shards or Baron bough.
---
is this a real thing?
---
It got a straight up 25% damage nerf
---
That area you ended up in is part of the adventure "invitation from the emperor" (if I remember the name correctly)
---
Yeah, I'm aware of what some of them are, and I'm aware that they show on the rune in game... But why wouldn't you want that info on an all-in-one guide so you don't have to hover over each time while slotting in the chalice, was my point.
---

---
Just seems like logically if you're getting an external guide up anyway you would want as much info as possible on there to save time.
---
General Reposti!
---
I guess.
---
Here's the issue, they do. Endgame PvE Titans have little to offer. Example: Buffing thunder crash damage wont make your punk ass any less dead in PvP when you get hit by it but it would help boss damage.
---
Shhhh. The Locks and Huntards are trying to be victims.
---
Wow this has never been posted before!
---
This. All fucking day. Hunters dominate PvP. Pretending its OEM Titans is a deflection.
---
Uldren only killed Cayde because he fucked his sister  change my mind
---
From ada-1 you get the components for the weapons from her weekly bounties
---
How do i go about obtaining a ballistics log?
---
He isn't, this is just likely a bug like many other bugs that exist in the game.
---
You'll get the hang of the base game mechanics pretty quickly. And you don't need to be particularly good to enjoy the game either, unless you want to do a lot of PVP
---
ada 1 in the tower has bounties that reward you with them
---
Ohhhhh lmao I was like damn they must not like tobacco, but I‚Äôm sure the spitting is annoying I usually mute myself anyway
---
alright, thanks!
---
Dragonfly armor was the shit; most dropped with linear fusion perks. 16 rounds in the sleeper (pre-nerf) was excellent.
---
Naughty children get put in the BLUE TEAM
---
You only get 2 a week per character. One is for doing two forges which is super easy. And the other is to do 7 armory bounties. Grab all the bounties available if you want to do 6 a week (assuming you have 3 characters all able to do forges) and then just complete the bounties until you have 7. Boom two ballistics logs. Then grab two LMG frames and go to town. Dont worry you dont need to use two ballistics logs to just hunt down a good roll LMG. Once you buy that powerful quest for that one ballistics log you can go back and buy an easier one for the modulus reports and that makes an easier quest and you can retry the forge but it wont drop the LMG as powerful. I did that and rolled 6 hammerheads and got the God roll. Good luck to you!
---
Can I have some shards?
---
jfc i need it.
---
#LORD OF WOLVES
---
This is my favorite tyler1 clip lmaoooo
---
So once all the powerful frames have been bought once, ballistic logs become essentially useless since i can use modulus reports yeah?
---
I was thinking about how I'd like to try out lord of wolves, and a few hours later I got it from xur's fated engram. Pretty lucky
---
You haven't seen any videos on it?
---
Outbreak
---
You dont need ALL the powerful frames. And no ballistics logs are removed weekly. And quests will reset back to requiring them.
---
Then don't use a super?
---
I‚Äôve only heard good things about the pulse rifle and machine gun anyway. Thanks for your help dude!
---
i dont watch youtubers, twitch ,etc.  i just play the game and read dtg and crucibleplaybook
---
Yep
---
Those two are definitely worth going for! Also one more fun fact. Take these frames to burgusia forge. The last one on EDZ. You have a chance to get the two exotic weapons if you go there. (Only if your frame is powerful not the normal quest) and more people are there anyways
---
That doesn't sound too bad
---
I can understand that. I don't like many YouTubers but they've done a few good videos on it.
---
I don‚Äôt understand how to unlock the other forges lol. I only have access to the Volundr one.
---
Unpopular opinion, but I think this weapon is just fine where it is currently
---
That requires another entire perk for that one to even be considered good. That‚Äôs how you know it isn‚Äôt.
---
We do. How many Titans do you see being required in a PvE LFG? None. Being matched with 3 other titans in gambit was one of the worst gambit experiences by far. We lost by a huge margin unsurprisingly. Without OEM, Titans have practically nothing to bring to the table in PvP, I've come to realize that I have pretty much never used any titan exotic in pvp until I got my first OEM. Hunters will be hunters and D1 blink-shotgun is back in the form of Warlocks. Great time to be a Titan.
---
Check with Ben Googling again.....

Maybe he gave you a bum steer...

Actually been really enjoying sniping. Never really used one because everyone trashed them. I'm in love with my Beloved.
---
Thank you all for your response! I think I will go with that.
---
There are many glitches in there. One for the current boss that drops to many orbs when you kill a thrall, and one for crystals. Killing the harpies spawns unlimited numbers of heads
---
Never
---
Repost
---
shotguns and grenade launchers are worse, at least snipers require some amount of skill
---
That happened to me last week.
---
Just go to Orbit, back to the Dreaming City, and make a bee-line for the Corsair body.
---
That fixed it for me.
---
You can also get it from the other weekly bounties from spider as well
---
 I don‚Äôt know... Fast travel is pretty nice
---
All rise mothafucka
---
Was it worth it?
---
Ikora shoots cats out of her hands? Warlocks are weird.

No shadowkeep is the year 3 expansion
---
I bet that guy was salty asf after that lol
---
You have absolutely no reason to play Destiny 1. You could get it an experience the story and such but really you don't have to play it for any reason to play Destiny 2, and the game is long irrelevant at this point. If you play D2 and decide you want to experience D1 that's better but if you're looking to get into the best Destiny experience, definitely start in with D2.
---
lmg is not part of a year 1 joke loadout when will you finally understand
---
I've been playing for almost 10 months now, and my highest legendary shard count is around 200. I always pull stuff out of collections and buy engrams from xur (still only have like 5 exotic engrams ever dropped unfortunately)
---
It's definitely possible to not have many shards, because of infusion/collections/etc.
---
I'm a little confused. I bought D2 + expansion pass when it launched on PC through battle net. What would I have to purchase in order to get caught up to current and not pay extra for things I already have?
---
Would I need to buy anything on my Xbox in order to play it on there, or can I use my purchase on PC to activate that account on Xbox too?
---
If I can just add my Xbox profile to my pc version, can I do that with multiple profiles on my xbox if I own the game on multiple PC accounts?
---
Does this mean I can play on pc with friends on their Xbox or PS4?
---
Also a quick side question, is there a guide to explain the ins and outs of D2? I understand the basics, but I'm really lost as to what gear and guns are the best and how to get them and what situations to use them for and things like that. I haven't played since Osiris came out and even then I was a little lost.
---
[removed]
---
That likely is the case yes
---
Buy it on the account that owns forsaken dude. Common sense mate.
---
if youre able to access the raid (ignoring light level) she should sell them.
---
When you talk to Petra, she should be carrying 2 rows of dreaming city bounties. The third row has the four tiers of blind well keys AND the raid banners next to them.
---
TL;DR the two items on the bottom right of Petra's inventory are raid banners
---
3 legendary shards or 5k glimmer
---
Oh, yeah... nvm, I'm just an idiot.
---
How did you get there???
---
Neither did we. The encounter is very straight forward, but i do find that sometimes people have issues with calling out locations of crystals when running with players who are new, or are running with people they don't know. Anything to make it even a little less confusing.
---
This has been asked way too many times. Google exists.
---
This, plus Hunters have enough armour for everything on spectral regardless.
---
And then esoterick if you just wanna see how the fuck to do something with no talking
---
Either way lul
---
I love Hush, both the YouTuber and the bow
---
It‚Äôs still the best gun in the game on console. Recoup control can‚Äôt be that hard. It‚Äôs a 10 round burst shotgun that does enough damage to kill after the 4th shot. It can one hit an overshielded super at chaperone roadborne range and also kill another person as collateral.
---
Just to add to this - I had been doing the powerful on my chars for two seasons and never had it.  Did all the other spider quests and got it within a week. Same for my friend I play with. 
---
I'd try some of the non powerful bounties
---
AM I STUPID OLEASE HELP
---
I did all the ones I could a while ago i cant do the nightfall yet because one of the two guys i usually play with is in vegas and can't play and i haven't done the gambit one on the top BECAUSE it says i need something before i can play but other than that i've done everything
---
i did it all on thursday i think and it's now saturday and i haven't gotten any new powerful gear ones
---
Scatter horn hood for Warlock looks like a sack
---
and also i looked it up and it said the daily ones refresh every four days and that's why i said four days isn't daily, i'm just assuming the website is right about that though so idk
---
Thank you for the answers. 
---
To clear some things up. When I was asking about the different accounts on PC merging with the different xbox accounts, I mean I bought the game twice on my PC. Could I connect my main PC account to my Main xbox profile and then connect my second PC account to a second xbox profile and share my progess across platforms that way while still having the two different accounts?
---
Just to clear up about the DLC. Would I be able to purchase the content to get me up to current on PC and then use that purchase on my connected xbox profile?
---
*laughs in no effort cleanliness*
---
Left to right

Reset your valor rank then go to Amanda holiday

is it one thing specifically or is it different every time because i haven't gotten a new one since thursday and i'm starting t

Astrocyte comes no where close to the benefits OEM does. It just makes blink functional. There's no wall hack/damage buff/health regeneration.

It changes everyday. It.might be a crucible match, a strike, a Gambit, a heroic. Only thing I haven't seen a daily ofnis a nightfall.

Spider likes that

Moons haunted

&gt;Could I connect my main PC account to my Main xbox profile and then connect my second PC account to a second xbox profile and still have the two different accounts?
---
Based on [the FAQ on the bungie site](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/47922), it sounds like you will be able to have two different accounts. 
---
&gt; Would I be able to purchase the content to get me up to current on PC and then use that purchase on my connected xbox profile?
---
To access DLC activities on a platform, you need to buy that platform's DLC. This means that to do, for example, Last Wish on both xbox and PC, you would need to buy Forsaken on PC and Forsaken on xbox. As far as I know, details about whether or not you can use DLC items on a platform where you don't own the DLC have not been addressed, but it would be super annoying if swapping from one platform to another led to half your items being automatically unequipped, so I am guessing you'll be able to play on your character in its entirety on a platform where you do not own the DLC, you just won't be able to do the DLC specific activities.
---
Tbf tho, hunters are designed for pvp.
---
Did you actually turn in the bounties? Go to the pursuits tab and click on the ones you did.
---
Skyrim vibes
---
okay thanks you so much
---
Why would you pay for something that will end up free anyways? You‚Äôre not gonna wait 2 years for it to go free they force you to buy it at full price which is shitty no matter which way you look at it.
---
Awesome!
---
The handcannon you see is Service Revolver,
---
His sniper is Tatara Gaze, a black armory weapon
---
That is a terrible excuse though.
---
You paid to play the game 2 years before the f2p players. You get to have more experience in the game than the new players. You get access to things that the f2p players don't have like some raids. Stop being salty.
---
Gets obliterated by a 0.00000000001 ttk weapon
---
Only 11 days, now that you mention it, that's not a lot.
---
It‚Äôs irrelevant content that I won‚Äôt play either way. I‚Äôll just view it as lowering the barrier to entry for new players, allowing them to give us a refreshing experience. I see what you‚Äôre saying, but it has positives that go along with it.
---
THANK THE NINE, DESTINY is now an MMO! xD
---
It‚Äôs a ‚Äúsale‚Äù that‚Äôs what the price will drop to when the next expansion comes out. So in actuality it‚Äôs the new price. Can‚Äôt wait to buy it on Monday. Also for anyone wondering if you should get some kind of refund for buying prior to the price drop/ f2p conversion im gonna quote Datto on this: ‚Äú THATS NOT HOW THE WORLD WORKS‚Äù for reference go watch his video about shadowkeep.
---
You mean on Io?...
---
Nah, in past DLCs and games, Bungie have always showed off the original weapon to get us hyped.
---
Definitely not Touch of Malice. We have no damn clue what gun it could be though. You‚Äôre probably gonna have to wait a few months till Shadowkeep launches to find out.
---
So it's not a copy and paste then :)
---
I changed it and made my research. I could've sworn someone told me it was Nessus..
---
Yeah, must be a new one then
---
R/borrow
---
On multiple occasions Bungie, specifically Luke Smith, when asked the question, has responded with something along the lines of ‚Äúwe have many things we want to do with Destiny 2, so if there is a Destiny 3 it won‚Äôt be for another 2-5 years.‚Äù
---
Funny enough, I did this yesterday. Why its in the game is unknown, but it's weird as hell..
---
Recluse literally only requires wins. Easiest of all the quests without a doubt.
---
Would really be hoping I didn't have to borrow money off people for something like this
---
Just as a last resort man if it means alot to you and you can pay them back on time it's no biggie
---
Nice, even better
---
Not at all for me
---
Oh my God I remember there was this and then the bumblebee arm Cannon
---
You can hover over it in collections and see "how to obtain" now says "exotic engrams; extremely rare world drops"
---
Just getting back into this game after being gone for over 6 mo. Has this gun improved? When I left it wasnt really all that but i see more and more people using it now.
---
This sub isn‚Äôt supposed to be 99% memes. Actually it‚Äôs not, it‚Äôs just memes are the only things that get upvoted instead of actual discussion. Unfortunately you have to sort by new and filter out the nonsense to see it
---
We died waiting in traffic, so ‚Äúcool‚Äù must be a pretty loose definition
---
Considering how rare they are it makes sense for them to be powerful
---
1. Imperial Dress
---
2. Outbreak Perfected
---
3. Geomag Stabilizer (Preferably with ornament)
---
4. Warlock Crown of Sorrow armor set
---
I cant see D2 lasting another 2-5 years. Maybe...maybe 2 but that would be it. Unless they leave it around for the older generation console players and D3 will be for nextgen consoles and above.
---
At this point i much prefer service revolver
---
I feel as if they lowered the learning curve of the weapon a fair bit. 150's being able to 3 tap to the head kind of negates mag howl but you get the kill if you miss that last headshot which is really nice. And not only that but being a precision frame means it just feels snappy. 
---
I'm fine with it being nearly useless in PvE though, I've got plenty of other weapons that's murder bosses quicker than Luna's ever did.
---
Because they are the foundation of the game.
---
Uhh recluse is probably the least intensive pinnacle weapon
---
I had maybe forgotten about that. Still though think it comes from pvp
---
It makes no sense. I don‚Äôt see anyone going into the raid with mismatched gear. The need the LL for strikes I guess?
---
Why do you respond to me ? Your answer has nothing to do with what I said lol 
---
I personally don‚Äôt like one sided help - especially if I never see those people again 
---
48000 people were able to do the raid in the first week without anybody carrying them 
---
So why can‚Äôt new raiders and not that experienced raiders team up? 
---
Why do you need exp people to teach new people ? 
---
Why can‚Äôt people use guides which were explicitly made for new people so they can start their own raid? 
---
Why do people rely on others to open a group they can join? Why can‚Äôt people create their own group and invite people? 
---
Big complains when Throne gone live: ‚ÄûMimimi nobody wants new people, everybody is looking for people who killed the boss already‚Äú 
---
Maybe search 2 people by yourself?
---
There is multiple bodies per badge with several locations, so google your badge with the full description and a guide should pop up on where the bodies will be.

You can only see the spot to place them if you have the banner in your inventory.

I got it in like 20 hours of comp, I never got over 500 glory. 2 wins, 4 losses, over and over again.

where do i see if i own the dlcs?
---
didnt notice anything about they went free and in blizzard launcher no dlc tab
---
the store just offers legendary or complete while complete has more content than legendary has? annual pass isnt in legendary even as it is more expensive
---
might i check in game somewhere if dlc 1 and 2 are available for free? where ?
---
thx
---
have been thinking about forsaken/legendary upgrade
---
while us key is cheaper than european account here...anyone knows if redeeming code with vpn and then claimed go on without us vpn european like always would work?
---
Keep your distance. I've found a well rolled pulse or hand cannon keeps you just out of range to get hit. Also, bait them out. Lots of LoW users will wait then try to rush you. I did pretty well with a bygones and bad reputation.
---
First off sorry must‚Äôve replied to wrong guy on accident. Second it‚Äôs a large scale multiplayer game all games like this are about community, teaching the ways of endgame, helping people farm etc. once you‚Äôre sitting at max power and don‚Äôt really have anything to get until the next content drop start helping others, I‚Äôm not necessarily saying carry and get them stuff for free because that‚Äôs wrong but helping and explaining how things work is perfectly fine. But then again I spent a lot of time in ESO where the endgame hardcore pve/ raid scene was pretty limited so teaching more people to expand that group was pretty much a rule and I carried it over to this.
---
Will reset in 2 hours.
---
Were do i put the bread??
---
Honestly, many know how to do the heroic, but don't because it's easier to melt the boss and skip to the next event.
---
I just finished enough of Spider's bounties to get both the Wrong Side of Right and the Right Side of Wrong in the same hour of playtime. I've currently got them both equipped (as I enjoy pulse rifles more than just about any other weapon).
---
Getting Garden Progeny 1 out of the forge on Mercury did make me change my dislike of most lower scout rifles. That thing shreds as long as you can hit your precision shots...
---
PC you can just make a macro on your keyboard to move. Like I play ARK a lot and have a macro for spamming E to collect rocks and what not.
---
Feels like crucible catalysts drop more frequently than strikes. Or maybe it‚Äôs just that crucible matches can go quick with rumble. Anyway, I too just picked up the Graviton Lance catalyst after a crucible match. Congrats! Now let‚Äôs hope the sunshot isn‚Äôt too far off...
---
Do you have the annual pass because I think you would love Blast Furnace
---
Also for flashpoints at a lot of destinations events are not constantly spawning so if you just destroy the tank on Titan or kill the escaped PoE guy on the tangled shore then you're more than likely wasting your time rather than saving it in the long run.
---
OP is a raid lair confirmed
---
I saw that vid, it's dumb how strong the weapon is
---
Yeah thats literally all i do.  The powerful gear.  I said that in post.  Its dropping like 25 light below me
---
does anyone else have this bug?
---
I actually kind of like the canister on the back. It fulfills my EVA titan fantasy
---
I got the shweet business cat from a comp game
---
tbh alot of the public events are quicker to complete on heroic than on easy.
---
I have 90
---
r/DTG for basically all of year one was awful for discussion. Felt like everyone just wanted to complain, and nothing constructive was said for the most part. At least the popular posts were, I guess. Here, the popular posts are memes, and like I said, real discussion is just sorta occasional low posts. So either I filtered through memes here or angry people there, I picked memes lmao
---
The thing that keeps on giving..... Bungie...
---
This is peak performance
---
Sotp raid gear in reef made besides the chest and black armory chest
---
Good point. Hopefully there‚Äôs a solution. 
---
So glad runes weren‚Äôt in consumables.
---
Solar is always a powerful starter because the first third of the game is all Arc and Normal, but once you get past the first Raid, it becomes terrible. Good for speedruns but a bad type overall.
---
The funny thing is that lord of wolves was already a solid gun in PVP. Now it's just disgusting.
---
But heroic events are random! /s
---
Yes I do! Could not pass up that combo package price for $40. I've been utterly disgusted with the way things have taken a turn for the worst in Black Ops 4 and solely decided to completely abandon that franchise. I feel very comfortable that I decided to stick for the next year now with Destiny.
---
If you‚Äôre going to get it, save up for the better editions that come with dlc so you spend less in the long run
---
FRONT
---
I've been hoarding vanguard &amp; crucible tokens for times in need of legendary shards or enhancement cores. I'm not sure how efficient it is but it's worked for me. Yesterday, I think I got like 14 enhancement cores with 800 or so tokens. I also stock up on finest matterweave for a rainy day, but I have no clue if they randomly drop or drop from certain things.
---
I raise you the psion one with the vents
---
Nailed it
---
Ayoooo this is so dope!!!!
---
Shimmitar.... Really?
---
lol I was thinking "Only 4? I have over 90" and then you have... over 400...
---
I remember when everyone called warlock the worst class back in d1 y1 when I maimed one. I laughed. Yet my entire people have A) cheesed atheon into oblivion, B) saved so many raid fails with self res (i‚Äôm especially looking at you skolas buddy) C) well of radiance is basically an essential part of every d2 raid now. D) They have the best jump and you can‚Äôt change my mind about that
---
DARCI does more DPS, what separated them before was the potential infinite ammo of whisper.
---
yeah I love my warlock for jumping puzzles like zero hour or whisper. It's just so accurate
---
It shows though that we completely wiped their defense, and that they were eliminated. So we should have won, but then I died clearing both teams and it gave the round to them.
---
Sorry, I just realized I made mistake, always meant to ask "supers" not sub-classes.
---
Anyway, that kinda sucks, I hope we get some confirmation on that front soon. 
---
I was hoping they would at least include the Forsaken supers given how integral they seem to each class. 
---
Although that might make too much Forsaken content free depending on what you need to do to unlock each super.
---
What the fuck. So they compete at the same range
---
The ultimate rng favor
---
Level advantages are disabled in pvp, it clearly states that before entering a match. 
---
If you're referring to the sensitivity, then i agree. We should be able to increase that and make it feel snappier. 
---
You can raid whenever you've hit the recommended light, bit earlier but it's easier to do it at recommended light. To raid, you us
---
You can buy items from Eververse by buying silver with real money or by collecting bright dust through her bounties or dismanrling gear from the engrams you receive.
---
Your account needs to be primary on his Playstation, then he needs to go on your account and under destiny 2 make sure all add ons are downloaded and installed, then once that's done, have him rebuild his database then go back onto your account and restore licenses and it should work

It‚Äôs gonna be team fortress 2 all over again. The f2p‚Äôs will be seen as the inferior race while the p2p‚Äôs will be gods amongst men

There should have been a 3rd picture and it would have been Lord of Wolves
---
My friends and during the menagerie and nightfalls will advance to the next cp, but then purposely go back to the player. The person eventually realize we know what they‚Äôre doing and move to the next cp themselves before blatantly activating their macros. 
---
These people don‚Äôt care about other people‚Äôs experience within destiny. It is beyond me that people will pay damn near full retail price for a game only to intentionally NOT play it.
---
Why did you post this here an r/DestinyTheGame
---
He may not even own forsaken.
---
ballin no nba
---
I highly recommend Power and Efficiency 2, because that random chance to get imperials will greatly help you get other upgrades faster.  Then I‚Äôd go with rune compatibility so you can start stockpiling up on the new runes.
---
That‚Äôs exactly what it‚Äôs like

Hi. I‚Äôm trying to do this week‚Äôs ascendant challenge. Which week is this?
---
yep one kinetic + one energy scout/pulse/hc/auto/smg/sidearm and all shotguns/snipers/fusions/rockets/grenade launchers were heavy weapons
---
Fair enough
---
Y'all got anymore of those enhancement cores?
---
I have over 100
---
Forsaken annual pass is just forsaken + annual pass. Complete edition gives some extra stuff
---
DPS doesn't matter if you don't have enough total damage to kill the boss, which is why Darci is only really meta to use on SoTP because of the damage buff.
---
I didnt know where to post it

Is it Kobe like Bryant or Kobe like beef?

Sagira is still my favorite ghost! Congratulations!

I only used Izanagis Burden/ Recluse and Fixed Odds (Machine Gun from Menagerie)
---
It seems you get these tributes from using different weapons from the Menagerie or Raid. My friend got a bunch of stones or something.

Popped the Triumph. Sladins Triubute appeared on the right side one the Screen with the Category "Tribute" after that I couldnt find it anymore. :(
---
I feel the same with Loaded Question.
---
Fuck
---
because it's fun?
---
That happened to me with the royal scoundrel triumph
---
Titan looks sick
---
I like to think there's a very large 5 year old somewhere underneath that armor
---
This is how crucible look. I tried once get ace of spades... I rage quited after 5 match (and got only 1 kill with revolver)
---
Turning a really good exotic special weapon into a heavy weapon is a terrible idea. Just nerf the weapon like with Telesto and be done with it.
---
In the Crucible? Or just random PvE?
---
the other team has to be so bad
---
how much primeevil healing did you get lol
---
A bug I think
---
Please give us that helmet
---
Check the season road map in game and you'll see that tribute hall is upcoming
---
Ok, how bout Ada-1, Banshee and rahool
---
Gambit too, 10 motes banked between three other teammates where they were all invading and dying, ignoring blockers on our side, never got to summon a primeval. I was top scoring on the losing team for three matches took my engrams and called it a night.
---
Bruh
---
Awesome that‚Äôs good news!
---
I‚Äôll report back if that‚Äôs not the case. 
---
Ofc I always try not to die, but because of this quest I‚Äôve been purposely avoiding certain strikes, avoiding reviving teammates who died in a bad place etc
---
It takes wayyyyyyy more than twenty or thirty bounties. It‚Äôs like &lt;1% per bounty.
---
There's something y'all need to understand. 
---
It's pronounced BE-LOVE-EDD not "be-loved." PLEASE get it right, destiny streamers/content creators
---
also I'm being serious about the guy claiming it didn't have aggressive tracking. like no joke I hade to get video proof for him.
---
Did you have the fallen transponder ready, or just LFG into a party?
---
Cross-platform PvE would complete this already amazing game.
---
i see, thank you so much!
---
Go for 5-10 mote, whatever you pick up in one section drop it in bank, helps if you have a team to communicate with
---
*destiny 2 initial release*
---
Ada-1 is your very distant cousin who is very mysterious and you think she is trying to sacrifice you to the demonic gods. 
---
Rahool is your smart quiet older brother 
---
Banshee is your very expensive drug dealer
---
Np shrooby ;)
---
People use it for the amount of situations it's useable in. Ehroars video covered that each weapon is some of the best of what it does, which is why it's so good. And whenever things survive the first 6 shots of wendigo, it's time for another buff to be activated, but it's useable for quick dps, not over 30 seconds, like most situations other than Argos, insurrection prime, and whatever the new raid boss is called
---
Gun needs a nerf.. It can one burst supers. Its broken in the way that you're not supposed to one burst supers.
---
Yaaaaaang
---
Tis tough to be a warlock dad of a 1.5 year old guardian in the making. I'm about to get ready for my next grind and she is like (in undiscernable baby babble) HEY!! PAY ATTENTION TO ME!! and I'm like oh... but the solar system needs saving... Haha hot out to (me) and my other dads of destiny out there! Been here since dark below and it's my absolute favorite game !
---
Oof I was gonna volunteer to help you out but I'm on ps4.
---
and?
---
I‚Äôm using bad reputation and it‚Äôs been good. Just tap with it and keep practicing.  You‚Äôll get use to the recoil
---
Why do a public event in general? If you're gonna do it at all might as well go all the way.
---
How much glimmer is it?? Mine just says to pay him off and I'm at 50k right now
---
I was thinking the uncle that asks if you want to go smoke a joint before dinner
---
Dammit. Ok thank u!
---
It's simple math guardian.
---
I think all the d2 community agrees that after they leave their immune shit they always need to get punched/ stabbed or whatever the war locks do
---
little fuckers
---
Oh so I don‚Äôt need to equip anything in that slot? It s just like a perk?
---
HeRoIc Is rAnDoM
---
I play fairly regularly. Do most powerful drops every week and raid once a week. Im always almost out of shards and every time i think im catching up xur comes around again
---
You get radiance from the forges as random drops, take it to Ava and get the part to put in there
---
you forgot grandma Eva!
---
if you aim at their feet you might also get a headshot
---
Ahhh I see! Ok great thank u kindly
---
Nah she is your moms uncles grandpas sisters friend who tries to get you into a pyramid scheme
---
a female guardian?. good luck on your journey ahead, while my path was short may you go on and live it up and remember to do those bounties.
---
*GASP* how dare you say that about her! that tonic was actually real.
---
Freaking awesome
---
When they‚Äôd revive in D1 and you would kill them again
---
Seems very shellfish of him...
---
Seems you guys need to do more Raids. Every time you get a Master Worked Apex Predator from Last Wish it's actually 7 Enhancement cores in disguise.
---
what the people on the street thinks we do: slay monsters, killing gods, annihilating dragons 
---
what we actually do: grinding the same lost sector for 924 hours to get a shotty
