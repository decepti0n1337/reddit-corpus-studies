Alright then, who has the time for that
---
*as everyone here starts talking about d1*
---
Damn.
---
Thanks for the info.
---
tf? of course its a glitch, the way shards work speed up your super regen the same way that mayhem already does, thus it stacks. if it just gave you a flat percentage over the timer then it would be balanced. you literally have infinite nigh uncounterable supers. btw that is the most generic excuse ever because its supposed to be a fun gamemode but only players who abuse this get to have fun in it while everyone else suffers for it. so thanks for that. try playing mayhem without shards, against someone who is using them, and tell me how that goes. idk if you remember but when they first added the new subclass blocks in forsaken, it took several months before bungie put mayhem as a playable gamemode and its because of shards. because they are aware that some people don't have any morals or compassion. so thanks dude.
---
No prob!
---
posting vids is fine as long as they are direct capture and d2 related, but if you're just trying to grow your channel then this is  self advertising
---
Easy way to get the needed Glimmer ;)
---
Thanks for the damage numbers, thought I was losing out a lot not having spike.
---
its not a bug thats for sure.
---
I'm not new, just ignorant
---
My fusion bounty also went up some when I had no fusion rifle.  I didn't notice if it was my bow doing it.   I did notice that my linear fusions don't work for it.
---
It happens every time I run the strike.
---
Not used for much but it‚Äôs a good habit to pick up the gun each week if you don‚Äôt have it as you‚Äôll fill up your collection a lot faster that way.
---
You have all the exotics then
---
I would say lag but the fact that he started emoting tells me he‚Äôs doing something to manipulate the network. But I‚Äôm

Special: wizened rebuke(w/demolitionist) loaded question
---
Heavy: Swarm of the Raven w/spikey Bois
---
My set up because I don't have recluse or mountaintop and orewing sucks for yellow bars compared to a fusion. Demo wizened rebuke for grenade spam to proc hive armaments. Then the cherry on top, missle Titan with skullfort so I can slide over ammo for a damage buff, have infinite melee and get super often
---
Sites like www.light.gg have this, but it only records players who have given permission to be tracked by signing up on site.
---
Besides sites like this, I'm not aware of anything that can mass-track players.
---
The only non-sign up tracker I've seen is Destiny Tracker, but you can only view a single player at a time.
---
 That's all?
---
Lmao yeah üòÇ thought so
---
Cabal are cats confirmed
---
I like crucible
---
Two different subreddits sorry about that
---
Ok, well I think it was a waste of time programming it
---
Its on my mini factory
---
Good thing they didn‚Äôt just make the game based on your opinion lol
---
I figured it was a bug .checked the known issue after i posted this
---
It‚Äôs not like hammers where you can just spam RT and the explosion will get them... on top of that you aren‚Äôt completely immune to damage unlike every Titan super.
---
I can relate
---
I was used to use bottom tree put I can never get the smoke bomb to make me invisible
---
It‚Äôs got a little too much aim assist on the blades, but I think that other shutdown supers offer enough back-end utility that the table is even. I think it‚Äôs mostly placebo in that there are many more hunters in the crucible than any other class.
---
Everyone's a professional programmer these days....
---
The whole ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of age tees in the crucible-‚Äú thing makes it worse imo. It just means getting spammed by it more often.
---
Have you *used* tether in mayhem? Nobody has fun, including the Nightstalker
---
*loud metallic clang*
---
Nah you haven‚Äôt played mayhem if you don‚Äôt think tether is absolutely absurdly the most rage inducing super to ever exist
---
Do you mean a different rule? I don't think we violated the English/Destiny 2 content rule. 
---
My apologies for linking a stream, it is not monetized in any way so I figured it would be okay, but I understand why it could not be allowed as a general rule. We were just interested in some company while we goof around in the raids tonight. Won't happen again :)
---
"Hey bro, would you  punch me if someone offered you a million dollars?".....
---
Again, it‚Äôs mostly placebo. More hunters in game, you see it more.
---
bro you just posted cringe
---
Same thing happened to me in a strike yesterday! So frustrating!
---
repost
---
I saw the Ramen shop one and the Colonel. Colonel made me especially sad.
---
It's cause of that one lost mote. That's the problem
---
I‚Äôm a nightstalker main, mate. I never said anything about fun, I was arguing that it‚Äôs actually not an actual problem if you know that they have a nightstalker. If you check your corners and don‚Äôt just run into a fight in super without checking for enemies, tether is not problematic.
---
the simularity is uncanny
---
It‚Äôs rage inducing *if it works*. Does it *ever* work? Fuck me if I know. Firing a tether is like buying a scratch-off ticket.
---
yoinked my post again
---
It's pretty lame, and a main complaint from players since D1. But for story missions, patrol zones, and strikes fireteams have a max of 3. Tower, Raids, and most of crucible can have a max of 6 people.
---
My background has always been black...
---
Too many Titans for a PvE activity
---
Oh nice man. Thank you.
---
KWTD worlds firsts only
---
For solo players I think huckleberry is better because of the auto reload especially if you're a hunter, but these are both top teir pve builds
---
It gets better what if instead of fighting hive wizards you fight the evil fairy godmother surrounded by mini Prince Charming screaming o√≠ o√≠ o√≠
---
Yeah several times a week since. Did all the dailies yesterday and today. Watched a video on how to obtain spare rations and saw you could get it from prime bounties. Went to check, cause I have only played 1 prime match this week. And did have any.
---
Crazy that people are being critical. This is sick! Can you make me one? Haha
---
Okay then, bye.
---
This is the only game mode I feel like I have a fair fight in cause every where else it‚Äôs roaming supers such as striker titans and nova warp or dawn blade. I LEGIT ONLY USE BLADE BARRAGE unless I‚Äôm raiding with friends or need to do stupid gambit challenges.
---
Do I have to do a tier one reckoning with the weak synthesizer to get them back?
---
It can‚Äôt be unseen
---
Do I have to do a tier one reckoning with the weak synthesizer to get them back
---
Well I did mention we could go for "anything in the first 2 slots" regardless of it being energy or kinetic, so mountaintop/recluse could still be a thing, but other loadouts like say Izanagis and blast furnace, bad juju and imperial decree/threat level, ikelos and inaugural address could be used, allowing for more diverse weapon combos on both PvE and PvP
---
I love it!
---
Good.
---
You're the problem anyway, so thankfully you're already being deterred.
---
Im glad someone reported it
---
These kinds of monsters need to be arrested
---
That is some pretty sub-optimal DPS
---
Totally the problem, not the fkers on my team that can barely do crap most of the match
---
He just wants his bowl of ramen
---
How are blade barrage hunters any worse than Slowva warlocks who just lob them in general directions.
---
I believe the mountaintop is a triumph. Go under crucible-&gt;glory-&gt;4th one down on the left side of the triumphs.
---
The quests are now in the pursuit tabs in the director, you'll see that one in there.
---
In the crucible triumph tab, under glory, there is a triumph called "in pursuit of glory". That's where you'll see your progress. Good luck
---
Actually its the one to the right of that triumph called "in pursuit of honor".
---
but there is a vault
---
Is it easier to gain progress towards quests when playing Mayhem? Only asking because I'm thinking of going for the Chaperone and Recluse.
---
How dare people be bad at a video game?!?!?!
---
Jokes on you I can‚Äôt use blade barrage cos my internet is so bad the blades don‚Äôt render when they hit they hit someone.
---
"Hwve, Bwing a Swoword"
---
They are already lvl 50, at this point they shoud atleast know how to fking play comp, why get into comp if you fking sucks anyway? just making the team carry you since you are trash
---
Yeah it did.
---
Kind of sucks though tbh
---
It‚Äôs an emote from eververse
---
I don‚Äôt understand.
---
Calus sees himself as the singular god, it would warrant a big G
---
This is cool, but can we talk about how he beat a LoW at that close range, the other guy must be fuming
---
But Calus believes himself to be an all-encompassing god, I understand the religious problems but it would still make sense it be capitalized
---
AHHHHH! SAVE YOURSELVES! FLEE FOR YOUR LIVES!!! 
---
woah... sorry.  I‚Äôve never been quite the same after... after‚Äîwe never stood a chance! The doctor says it‚Äôs trauma, that some other guardians have had it before. It‚Äôs like... I‚Äôm there... all over again. 
---
First, I hear it... it‚Äôs like the sharpening of a knife, but loud, so loud. And then the screams, my fire team... I can‚Äôt talk about it. I‚Äôm sorry, I didn‚Äôt mean to let it go so far, but some days, I hear it everywhere I go. And it makes me angry. 
---
goddam hunters and their blade barrage cheese, kill me like a man! With a melee to the face! 
---
Sincerely,
---
    -A traumatized Titan
---
PS: this is a cry for help, if there are any Titan support groups out there, I‚Äôm in dire need of group therapy to manage the symptoms of my failed PvP grind.
---
Warlocks are not in a terrible spot - definitely the best nades and very decent roaming supers
---
Maybe it's just me then but seriously GG just takes more damage when in super than any other super. I can get one shot, at full health, with a shotgun, but others in their supers need 2 GG shots, with six shooter, to take them down. Again, maybe it's just me and I'm getting bad luck, and the fact that I've not fully upgraded my armor but still, when I use GG I just feel weaker than every other class. As for the accuracy I haven't seen much, but I suck at aiming when it counts so that's most likely my fault there for being trash.

Controlling the detonation is irrelevant with a direct hit ( idk why you are explaining how they work), which is a one hit, which is my point. Mountaintop shoots in a straight line practically.
---
Hinters are super good in crucible. They get literal wall hacks for getting a headshot
---
FIRST CURSE
---
Religious problems? The only problem with religion is that is still......well nevermind. I was more referring to the idea of singular vs multi. Calus is a bodiless cooku bird though. I wouldn't be surprised if he was uploaded to the onboard computers and isn't even alive at all.
---
Devs said each class would get more than one...
---
I think it the OCD not religion that‚Äôs the issue
---
Very nice I approve
---
It may be linked to the bug in competitive where you would keep loading.
---
The fix for that was to open your pursuits to ‚Äúfully complete‚Äù a bounty because they wouldn‚Äôt fully complete for whatever reason and were causing you to load constantly.
---
If you have a patient group the raids aren't hard to learn, but the answer to your question is SotP
---
Dats hot.
---
Thx
---
To add to what the other comments said, you gotta do the bounty for the helmet specifically to get the helmet.
---
You can fix it by going into your pursuits.
---
Same brotha
---
Scourge of the past is by far the easiest raid in all of destiny's history. in order to get the max amount of points you need to have all 9 slots filled with a callus themed weapon / armor. Bad juju Terrible and Acrius also count.
---
It's a percentage meter of encounters. So it depends on your loadout and how many encounters you do.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised either but even still the way he presents himself and speaks makes it known that he does indeed have a god complex, and in a weapon from him, talking about him, it would make sense that he would have a capital G considering that he is talking about himself from his perspective.
---
I think I just repeated myself like 4 times trying to say the same thing, sorry if it came off that way
---
You just pick that up from drifter I‚Äôm assuming?
---
Please this.
---
This whole comment chain is a train wreck.
---
Unfortunately, incarceration would be ineffective in this case. OP clearly needs the kind of expert treatment only the finest mental institutions in the world can provide. I‚Äôm thinking lobotomy is the best solution for everyone
---
Hahaha, it's all good.
---
Knockback is such an annoying mechanic. Oh you wanna jump? Lemme just juggle you to death with no counterplay other than icarus dash
---
Point being I was talking about fighting lion has a detonation you can time and mountaintop does not. You have to hit your shots with it and this isn‚Äôt overwatch and you aren‚Äôt pharah. It isn‚Äôt practical to use at longer ranges unless you‚Äôre a total god. It simply cannot compete with other grenade launchers due to it lacking the 2 things that make grenade launchers special. It‚Äôs fun but if I were playing personally I‚Äôd use fighting  lion over mountaintop any day of the week.
---
Tether makes Calculated Trajectory medals easier to get and in Mayhem you have lots of Tethers.
---
By Felicia
---
It's assault rifle week, I'll wait till the weapon rotates
---
Revoker
---
Anything else?  Those sniper kills will take me forever
---
So if you're running Reckoning with only one Warlock would you like me to run Nova Bomb/Warp over a Well of Radiance?
---
sniper kills are easy, just go into asia rumble and farm all the bots
---
Eveything else is going to require reaching fabled.
---
You could say, that's a really nice... Gambooty
---
And the main focus of destiny is pve the pvp is just there to grab the extra Cash from the pvp folks.
---
Wait that's a thing?
---
I feel bad if you main titan and are failing at pvp üôÉ
---
Wait really
---
Hmm this seems effective
---
delet this
---
Anything that rewards powerful gear, but no farm that im aware of.
---
Either they will get slaughtered or government will have moved all the secret shit elsewhere while keeping stuff there to not look suspicious.
---
Okay thanks
---
I honestly believe they added the high mat amount to stop people from getting it quickly. I feel they should reduced the cost to the 80% discount after a week or month cause fuck the grind.
---
While I do think that that Shards needs to be fixed for Mayhem, it also ruins it in the only places it‚Äôs good in PvE (3rd round of Gambit and Blind Well). It needs a buff in general as well as this fix.
---
Just came back after a year like 4 weeks ago so been grinding back up
---
Yes I suppose
---
Practice practice practice.
---
Hey man I feel you. I dont want to grind it either
---
Thank you!
---
But I already did. And it took 3 days. Get a play of the game with blast radious mw
---
It's slow and steadyüòî already hit fabled so just comp queuing
---
Get it bro!!
---
Aka the fuck your mayhem experience move
---
I don‚Äôt think the bad juju mission was supposed to be hard tho. It‚Äôs so easy it seems on purpose. It‚Äôs a more accessible exotic.
---
Thanks. Thanks? Thanks. Thanks!
---
All the upvotes
---
No lie. This is titan
---
Keep at it, one day you'll look back at these and see how much you've improved. Art is all about constant practice.
---
Duke 44 w/rangefinder and rampage
---
100% agreed. Even then, range is only an issue with the right role.
---
Honestly thinking about going to D1
---
Check out Titan Army's Youtube page... that's all I'll say
---
Yeah I was just making a joke but took the opportunity to teach those who don‚Äôt know this yet
---
One of the Titan's eyes aren't crossed out. Oh wait. A Titan not using One Eyed?
---
Gotta be pacient with the titan one, unless theres one there, these are really good though
---
yup
---
what a godly gun, absolutely beautiful
---
Somebodybsaid gjallahorn?
---
Give us a mode where its dark with low visibility and everyone has a trace rifle
---
Meh, Blade Barrage is what it is.  It is those running Tethers and Tractor cannon are the ones who hold a special place in hell!!!!
---
I think they should significantly nerf the range at which blade barrage daggers deal damage (In crucible) and decrease the damage of single blades (In crucible). This would make it so blade barrage is a point clearing and close up super anialator rather than a indiscriminate life deletion that kills people just showing up to the part from around a corner 20 meters away üòÇ
---
Yes, this is what I was talking about, being carried through it. Thanks for the info
---
That was a good shot. I would work on positioning next, aiming is half of the battle. Knowing where to aim from is a huge part as well
---
Mayhem in a nutshell

Tether Hunters deserve NO MERCU

It‚Äôs literally exactly what Shaxx says, except BLADE BARRAGE is the extinction level event
---
The boons  are either in your postmaster or you already did 4 for that day

I'd like to get into scout rifles but I'm not sure which one to pick. 
---
That and I'm going to use a bow over anything in any game because that's a weapon type I've always been good with.
---
indeed
---
Is that a thing that exists any more?
---
Beloved
---
Ah, thanks
---
IKR! That's weird as hell, kinda makes me think that there might be a reason why they would do that, this is more disrespect than anything considering everybody probably steps over it when going to Zavala...
---
Mine always looks like this? What‚Äôs the other way look like and how do I not make it black?
---
It's unopened and has the annual pass sticker. Thanks!!!
---
Waiting for one of my clan mates to drop out of the raid. Will I be able to redo the first half later?
---
Nice one bro. Haven't seen a good trevor meme in a while now.
---
Our PVP isn't great either. 
---
We don't get guided ults like the warlock. None of our abilities can disable abilities and ults like the Hunter's can. 
---
Our only advantage is being a little more tanky and that really isn't much.
---
Lfg
---
Yeah the new 3rd generation ones aren‚Äôt for right now but he‚Äôs running an R5 1700
---
I disprove of your titan teammate but nice throw!
---
yea i know but everytime i bring that up all the hunter and warlock mains get their panties in a twist and start saying their ults aren't as op as they are
---
Is this a personal attack or something?
---
I unsubbed from r/memes because of the Area 51 crap. But I can‚Äôt escape it
---
&gt;We don't get guided ults like the warlock. None of our abilities can disable abilities and ults like the Hunter's can.

Suppressor grenade does all of that though?
---
OP is still my favourite, that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs always going to be
---
Im pretty sure it should be available from Devrim from the rank up packages but i'm not 100% sure.
---
Where did you take this in game? And is that the Warlock wave? (Fellow Warlock seeking nice background shot of his character)
---
Just push him off the edge
---
wow what a piece of shit.
---
Real question is why isn‚Äôt he verified
---
More of a wavesplitter guy, this is awkward lol
---
Lol, Area 51 memes always hit front page.
---
Also, I always sort by "New."
---
Can we get banned for doing this cheese or no? 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I'm asking because I'm a dumb dumb thats cautious.
---
?
---
There is a facebook event someone made to invade area 51 for "alien secrets" and over 600,000 people have signed up to invade area 51 stating "they can't stop all of us"
---
I was watching the dream team and Datto do all the raids for moments of triumph.
---
"Good" is incredibly broad. There are a lot of weapons that are random drops from anywhere, and then some that are random drops from only specific places/activities. Year 2 items have randomized perks that will either make them good or bad. 
---
If you want an item that comes from a specific thing/place, you must grind that thing/place. You can see where items come from using the database website light.gg and scrolling to the bottom of the page. 
---
&gt;As far as weapons go, do you ever use exotic weapons in PvP or save your exotic slots for armor and use normal weapons?
---
You can equip one exotic gun and one exotic weapon at a time. Whether or not you have an exotic weapon does not affect your armor. I use a variety of guns depending on how I am feeling or what I want to try out. I try to select guns that cover a variety of ranges for pvp.
---
I love it
---
How do you master roll?
---
DAE Hunters bad?!?!
---
Wow you want a cookie you stupid fucking bot
---
"Ready for some fun? I know I am."
---
Hence why I am being downvoted. 
---
"WHY ARE YOU BOOING ME? I AM RIGHT!"
---
For whatever reason I had a hard time getting burn kills there. Ended up going to that Titan lost sector, shooting the ogre, then shooting the burn round under an acolyte. Worked much faster for me.
---
But it isn't the ult and the range is shit.
---
Think about how long slam lasts, how op the tracking of the throwing shield is, and how the middle tree solar literally has tracking fire tornadoes and then whine about how titan supers trash
---
I just want my goddamn hammer to be useful for once.
---
What i also want to say is that something like golden gun is unneeded in most cases because our weapons now deal more burst damage 
---
Hell even well (broken as it is) can be replaced with a rally barricade and something like Swarm of The Raven will still do stupid amounts of damage
---
Imo it‚Äôs not that titans are weak, the other two are just too unbalanced 
---
Like look at gunslinger, both regular trees offer next to no neutral game and focus entirely on the super (not fun) blade barrage sucks
---
Nightstalker: 
---
Bottom tree is useless, top tree is boring but the invis on roll is nice, and spectral is just a worse titan
---
Arcstrider is just arcstrider i guess
---
Top tree with a one-two punch shotty is cool
---
Now warlocks,
---
Dawnblade :
---
Top tree is more for pvp, Well tree has the second best neutral game, but Well is just too overpowered, why did they nerf bubble just to add this bullshit super ?
---
It does everything at the cost of just you pressing the super button. well in itself needs a nerf.
---
Bottom tree is nice for adclear but again, no neutral game 
---
Stormcaller is probably the most balanced subclass in the game right now, all 3 trees serve their purpose fairly while being fair
---
Voidwalker took a justified hit with the skull nerf
---
Slova bomb is still excellent at both adclear and single target 
---
Devour tree is probably the best, constant grenade and health regen for just killing ads, pair that with Nezarec‚Äôs and you‚Äôre on a roll
---
Nova warp could work in pve but it‚Äôs more pvp.
---
And hey speaking of shuro chi
---
Would you rather have a tether‚Äôs orbs for supers you‚Äôre not even gonna use or a commander titan‚Äôs single grenade that will clear the entire room while giving your team constant regen ?
---
I could help you with it tomorrow afternoon
---
Bad juju is actually really underwhelming
---
well‚Äôs haunted
---
Yeah the cheese makes it free
---
It is.
---
I mean sure when all of you are armored and stuff, not much different from a normal Gambit..... but I meant it explains why I get my ass handed to me by invaders every time i go in Prime :P
---
and wraith of the machine
---
Public events spawn so often that it‚Äôs really not that much of a problem, remember there are tons of people are also trying to get the same quest you are trying to get, just be patient. It‚Äôs not like the malfeasance quest that you have to wait for a random primeval to spawn and then have to rely on your team to win the round took me 3 months to get that one
---
If it‚Äôs the jump that is the problem then you just gotta get use to it and look at some pro warlock mains like Ehroar who use the jump really well
---
I do think there should be harder content. I remember back in D1 doing skolas only on the solar burn week because I couldn‚Äôt do it legit. I want more stuff like that but still doable. Unless you were on your A game it was really hard to beat him and that‚Äôs why everyone cheesed it. Harder content would be great but you have to balance the toughness of the difficulty and how powerful you feel. A mission isn‚Äôt fun when the only reason it‚Äôs hard is that every enemy takes 2 magazines of ammo to kill. Raids are also becoming not as fun since if everyone knows what to do they are very easy. The only one that isn‚Äôt is Spire of Stars since there are so many mechanics. I liked that raid because it felt like what a raid should be. A piece of content that you couldn‚Äôt master by watching a 3 minute video. And it kept being somewhat difficult even after you completed it.  But of course everyone says they don‚Äôt like that raid and never do it because it‚Äôs either too hard, too complicated, or they don‚Äôt wanna do it because they had a bad experience before. Because of this nobody plays SoS so a whole raid is irrelevant.
---
Which quest are you doing?
---
Man you really got me LOL
---
The current META is shotguns, fusions, Pulses and Handcannons.
---
Fuck
---
But they aren‚Äôt boosting each other they just boost the same thing
---
Probably not but I'd bloody hope so
---
Alaka-zoomba here come the death roomba

I use the same. They didn't have one though, that's why I'm so confused by it.

Huckleberry is a submachine gun. Bad juju is a pulse rifle. At close range huckleberry does better but once you are out of huckleberry's effective range, bad juju does far better
---
I really really hope that‚Äôs not what I‚Äôve been drinking for all of my ascendant challenges
---
You get to choose what you get! Menagerie is the easy mode of loot grinding.
---
Do you guys not see the enhanced sniper dexterity on the Gemini jesters? Definitely not a "standard" roll
---
Its not even better for add clear.
---
Outbreak with Catalyst can effectively wipe while groups of adds with a single shot.
---
Kill 1 thrall, Nanites go from thrall to thrall wiping them all out.
---
Get a few headshots? You can wipe whole rooms.
---
You can but theyre shit so dont bother.... go for bad juju since it just releassd and its a spicy quest exotic. For secondary take mindbenders or a decent shotgun and any large aoe rocket launcher for heavy and youre set
---
Sentinel Titan, defence and offence
---
&gt;You can get it from fated
---
Do you have some proof of this happening? As I understand it, it is not in the fated engram drop pool. If someone did get it from the fated engram, I would like to see so that I can tell people correct information.
---
I‚Äôm only in it for the memes.
---
True, good for both

i KnOw tHiS gOnNa bE lOsT iN sOrT bY nEw.

Love that sword tho
---
So I would buy forsaken for 20 bucks.  Then decide if you want shadowkeep with or without the expansion. 30 bucks without 60 bucks with. So your looking at 50 to 80 bucks plus local sales taxes. I would go the 80 route but I'm dedicated lol
---
Has to be only 1 element, like a set class and a set element, it came to mind and I was curious what people would choose if they had to choose only one I see your point though
---
But what does that have to do with shadowkeep? Is there a new area and that‚Äôs what they called it? Or is this something silly someone came up with?
---
Why can't we all go back to Destiny 1 on the PS3 and the Xbox (version)? I really want to finish the game but I cant beat the strikes bcz I cant find players.
---
Really want to go back to the OG.
---
Thanks for reading this if you did!
---
Beautiful
---
Wait..
---
He says that to you guys too??
---
Shadowkeep is a different DLC that you pay for separately. if you buy the forsaken complete collection, you get everything released so far except shadowkeep (which is coming September)
---
if you wait until September, only year 1 things are free + select things like Gambit. other things you'll need to buy forsaken for.
---
there are no bundles that I know of thus far that have forsaken content and shadowkeep content- so you'll have to wait until shadowkeep comes out September to get that content.
---
keep in mind that at 20 dollars, you're getting a damn steal compared to what I paid for (105 for season pass + game + some random cosmetic stuff, 40 for forsaken, and 35 for annual pass, and you're getting the exact same things for only 20 dollars/40 dollars). so if you really don't want to wait till September to play some more destiny, getting the complete collection might be the move to make. up to you though.
---
also, shadowkeep will be 35 dollars, and every season from then on will be 10 dollars admission, so kind of like a 10 dollar subscription fee, but every three months, which is not bad.
---
*whether. good meme btw
---
Houndish for news, Byf for lore, Cammycakes for pvp, and a couple others for Raid and other endgame related content
---
IT'S EDGE TRANSIT
---
I know dude you just can‚Äôt escape it
---
Half a million now
---
It might have to be melee kills im not sure
---
‚ÄúYeet‚Äù
---
super 50/50. i love Gambit to the point where I play it for fun sometimes, but other people will not touch it. with the way Gambit has been evolving, if you didn't like it then or now, you probably won't like it in the future.
---
I dont like this. I am very scared
---
So basically I could hit gamestop or anywhere else that price matches (Walmart or target) and buy the collection for $20? That doesn't include the game (correct?) But Sept I'll have it all except shadowkeep, but if I buy the forsaken collection shadowkeep would be $35 at release instead of $60?
---
Yeah that happens far too much!
---
I don't believe so, and even if it is I've melee'd plenty of Fallen so I still think something is wrong
---
Cpu limited, destiny is big on Cpu usage
---
Give titans PVE viability but take away the bullshit 1hit melees in crucible. As a warlock this gets old real fast.

I posted link of what I was gonna actually buy... is that the right thing?
---
(Here is a Copy and paste for the CONSTANT mountain top quest messages.)
---
Heya bud. If you want an easy fix, get some friends( either 8 or 12.) And form a kill lobby. 
---
What does this entail? Have each fire team leader be somebody that is in the same timezone and reasonable close to eachother. They will count down and launch into the playlist at the same time. Have 1 person on each team watch the lobby board to make sure yall are connecting to eachother. Now, start queu dodging till you find eachother. Make sure 1 team doesnt 1 sidedly win the game, ( stay close in score with 1 person from each team slaying the other.) And you will be able to farm this out collectively for hours. 
---
This works for mtn top and revoler kills.
---
NO this is NOT a banable offense.¬† 
---
Yes This takes on averages 2-4 games per person ( game type depending.)
---
Same thing happened to me
---
‚ÄúI have been falling for 30 minutes‚Äù
---
Bet you regret that title now, or is that the 9000iq play.
---
Nice!
---
Hey just so you know celestial is best burst damage as it can do max
---
Yes, cross-save will apply across all platforms
---
Trust me no hunter helmets look horrible from the back in d2
---
Ye
---
Quick! Put up a Ward of Dawn on the walker before a blueberry shreds it!
---
Someone created a Facebook event to raid Area 51 and 500,000 have signed up although lots of people have admitted they won't actually go supposedly based on an article talking about it.
---
You can tho the tornadoes move only slightly faster and there's travel time also arc supers give maximum speed and others don't
---
One eyed mask rewards ppl for playing worse, or running away. You can chain insta kill melees with isf. You can kill a super with shoulder charge and peregrine greaves instantly. You can kill many people if they are in front of you by using barricade with that one helmet. If you take the time to look around, you might see something. Crazy idea right?
---
take my updoot fellow guardian
---
A lot of those are forcing themself through the Mountaintop Quest. Personally, after 3 weeks to get my own and knowing what pain many of then go through, I will pay my respect to the steadily decline of their souls and mental health...
---
Just progress the forge a bit. The only reason afk works is because the encounter ends after 1 min. Push that out a bit and they will be returned to orbit.
---
Looks like I am bait that is just surprised to be invited then.
---
I love this
---
They should implement a feature that if you‚Äôre taking longer to bank, Drifter gets crankier and overall more upset, and his call outs to bank slowly get more aggressive. Maybe even call out to the guardian in question in the lower left like ‚Äú[Username] should bank their motes...‚Äù or Drifter tells the Guardian(s) in question to bank their motes. Something like ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôre you doing?! You still got motes? Bank already; your team‚Äôs waiting!‚Äù
---
I see you forgot to add blade barrage hunters as well
---
i havent completed the raid but i do have the 2 assault rifles can i still join plz
---
Came here to ask this
---
I reeeeerally hope we see some cosplay guardians making a fire team.
---
Ok so here's the thing shoulder charge is easily countered by current meta and getting charged while in your super is your fault for not being aware of your surroundings you can oneshot them in your super there is no reason for you not to kill them
---
Did did you just call kepris horn good are you daft 1 you'll die before the barricade is placed
---
2 it's just a second grenade in the form of a barricade
---
Was wondering the same thing.
---
OP is great, nothing beats the chain of nanites that will continuously spawn more and more of themselves after each kill
---
grammar dragon
