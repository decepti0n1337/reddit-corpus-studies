My favorite thing is to respond politely for the first few, then send pics of Dr. Phil hugging someone random and repeating who hurt you.

Its weird tho because a lot of activities dont seem to have localchat actve, even if u can type in it. Gambit does this sometimes too
---
In rumble it's great. You don't lose anything and are potentially helping others.
---
Dark souls 3 which doesn't adjust your sound to what you set unless you start the game
---
Then why do they have a consistently huge player Base? You talk about balancing issues but literally every single game has that, hell look at destinies history with Prometheus and low. You can dance around the question of if it’s so bad why is it still one of the most popular games. They moved to a more competitive style long before mechs were added. Don’t talk like destiny is the perfect shooter, it’s got tonnes of problems regarding weapon types being pretty trash such as scouts or auto rifles aswell as issues with supers being absurdly powerful currently.

I don’t even play fortnite I’m just sick of this circlejerk of fortnite bad minecraft good without giving any and decent points as to why.
---
Jotunn only drops from bergusia
---
Um imo as a titan main trying out a warlock dawnblade is the best super. Great range, speed, and length.
---
Its a time trial, you have to complete them in a certain amount of time for the emblem. Just completing them wont unlock the emblem
---
Same except I use riskrunner in place of skyburner. Ive tried other setups but I keep coming back to this.

I dunno. I've not encountered that many handcannons. I see them, but not as often anymore.
---
Forsaken will not go free to play. Only the base game and the year 1 expansions will be free.
---
It took a few weeks for people to realize how good the super was after the nerf. You can never judge a change just from an hour or 2 of gameplay
---
No it wont just the destinations and 2strikes and gambit will be free
---
that’s not consistent
---
That's the only thing I see on PC. Spare rations mindbender's is like the official crucible loadout now adays

Sonic and all stars racing transformed is the loudest
---
Been available for a long time to be honest
---
We'll see. I won't hold my breath after having played destiny for this long.
---
hm. I just get matches where ppl don't use them then.
---
where did you buy your key?
---
UR NOT ALLOWED TO USE WEAPONS THAT ARE IN THE GAME
---
Also skolas, which is fallen
---
Only the solstice gear will be given in 2.0 versions if you have them. Everything else will not be 2.0. You have to re-earn 2.0 versions of the armor. If it's armor that drops still, you can get it in 2.0.
---
😂😂😂
---
Or only on sony phones?
---
Happens more often than I'd like, especially at the moments I needed them most.
---
That's like saying thorn's catalyst should heal people. That's not how the weapon works at all. You can't make poison into healing syrup

all the shotgun apes

Do all campaign missions and dlc missions

Wondered what was going on. I’ve been kicking ass.

Whatever you can afford.

Wait so bygones, dust rock and go figure are no longer good?

Lmao ikr? What’s even funnier is that we lost by 2 points and he was in a six stack!
---
So is this just a name that every accepts for scenarios like this that I'm just now learning about? Are there different names for different enemies or is there only Harvey the Harpy? Because I am 100% ok with that
---
Let me tell you lol. I have all 3 at 750 +/-. When I want to destroy quickplay pvp, it's titan. When I want to up my chances at winning comp, it's titan or hunter. When I wanna flex on 'em, it's warlock. Like saying "I'm winning with a handicap".
---
If i recall,
---
Randal the Vandal of course
---
Harvey the Harpy
---
Greg the Dreg
---
Hank the Shank
---
Paul the Thrall
---
Dwight the Knight
---
Idk any others
---
Mind sharing your build strategy? Obviously I’m far from grinding out The Last Word, Recluse or a Malfeasance just yet, but I’ll get there.
---
The only armor I don't like coming out is the standard moon set. I think the others are awesome.
---
Thank you for exposing me to this glorious information
---
T H U D!      the audience is now deaf.

Funny enough, i don't see a lot of drb or erentil in ib this season. A lot of last word, beloved, recluse, mt, and spare ration from my experience.

Ya no choice but too wait sadly, although you don’t need to level in preparation as they are removing character levels and boosting everything to 750 light which is the max right now.

What about sublime engrams?

Oh, lmao

Ay not bad low key working on getting it myself.
---
For me I joined a random ep grind group (as in a ton of people just playing it and I decided to join in) I managed to get all the EP weapons in 1 day... I'm not sure how or why it happened, it just did
---
Another cookie-cutter response. With those bot-like replies, you might just be a vex.
---
Destiny is the only game that deafens and blinds you before you can start playing.
---
Arguments have an inherent bias. However, just because that's my point of view doesn't mean others don't share the same viewpoint.
---
If you want a real answer, it's because it's a functional battle royale in a sea of bad battle royale games
---
*shoots guy once*
---
*Marked for Vengeance x14*
---
It’s objective, some stuff is great and other suck; but that to each their own.
---
We didn't hear about it until after probably would have been much more simple
---
Us government is a vex simulation confirmed.
---
And I thought that punk is window XP…
---
That's some good shit
---
Not sure if they will or not, but if he is wanting to farm shards, dimantling legendaries would be the way to do it.  You could certainly just throw everything into the vault to dismantle after launch.
---
Its as if he is beating a dead horse or something
---
Regular levels will be removed on Oct 1. Your light level (gear level) will automatically be upped to 750 (highest possible today). You don't need to buy shadowkeep for that. Shadowkeep dlc doesn’t include forsaken.
---
*yuge* turn out
---
Its still low effort
---
Suck Off The Peen
---
What was that emote
---
I’ll give them that but some of their changes were stupid ideas to begin with while other things remain the same. An example is all the exotic nerfs that happened. Meanwhile, titans can still one hit shoulder charge you with full health and warlock melee is weak AF. You could probably pick something out of each update that’s happened for the life of the game so far and find an unnecessary nerf to go with something that has been ignored....like enhancement cores.
---
This has been answered soooo many time.
---
NO YOU DO NOT GET FORSAKEN OR THE Y2 ANNUAL PASS WHEN YOU BUY SHADOWKEEP.
---
Yes you will got to light lvl 750, everyone will, even new players.  Regular lvl (numerical 1-50) is going away.
---
F2P includes D2 (Red War), COO, Warmind, Gambit &amp; Gambit Prime, all strikes, all nightfalls, and all planets and bounties.
---
Shadowkeep Standard includes Shadowkeep and the F2P stuff only.  
---
Shadowkeep Digital Deluxe includes Shadowkeep, F2P, and the Y3 DLCs that will be released.
---
If you want to be able to do the Last Wish, Scourge of the past, Crown of Sorrows, Menagerie, Shattered Throne, Reckoning, or any of the Y2 exotic quests (Lumina, Thorn, Wish-Ender Bow) or get any of the Y2 raid/dungeon weapons or armor you MUST BUY FORSAKEN.
---
Right? It's crazy when they're all saying they wouldn't use it, so nobody should have it. Oh the logic.
---
Borderlands isn’t even loud
---
The emblem for just completing the raid looks way nicer than this one
---
r/killedbythearchitects
---
Iron Banner was the best back then
---
I’m on the same page don’t worry. I got sent a message the other day for using shotty/sniper...I was only using sniper scavenger too so I only had like 5 shotgun kills the entire game...happens. I still think that OEM/Erentil or LoW/Striker is about the easiest loadout that’s ever existed.
---
Exactly.
---
Amazing
---
I've had nothing but AFKs and Anti-AFK macro players in the forge for the last 2 days :( :( :(
---
Oh God I completely forgot about DS3

*adorable kid voice* geahbocks!

Helps you sleep when it’s warm

There needs to be a Captcha system in D2.  A picture is shown on the screen and you have to press the correct key sequence or you are booted.

That's quite detailed and well shaded! Perspective is on point too - she's got great talent!

Did he stutter?

No! Play more!
---
Completely untrue, multiple Silver-Exclusives have been sold more than once.
---
Yes, but it also made others unhappy. The shards of galanor nerf seemed pointless since they had already nerfed it but I didn’t get it until after the nerfs.
---
can't see forward properly
---
Wait wait wait. Where’s the fuckers with Jotünn going???? I thought that was in there too?!?! The fuck are we going to do now?!?
---
Neither can we, which is why we all learn English and give our best. (Should have been German, though. I guess something went wrong last time we tried to unify the European language system in the 1940's. But let's just be glad it is not Italian or Finnish. French would have been nice, though.)
---
I was taken aback at you stating it was "awful" playing on European servers and stating language-reasons for it, which made you sound ... well ... I guess you get it, no need to be explicit. Hence my comment which tried to point out that the fact that you in fact can be very lucky with the situation, otherwise you would be shit-out-of-luck trying to play with people and that we are doing our best reaching a common level of understanding.
---
On Oct 1st Warmind and Curse if Osiris are free. Forsaken + annual pass are not free.
---
I fucking hate when people call them "lunafication"
---
That’s already free back in August or something
---
Graviton Lance
---
Wavesplitter
---
Recluse
---
And I can't wait to try out the exotic autorifles and see how they perform now.
---
#SEXY ORYX TRAP PORNO
---
This is why I use golden gun nova bomb and bubble, Goldie doesn't even have armor nova bomb can kill after you die and bubble you are almost unkillable unless you are dumb
---
Tastyyyyyyyy cayde
---
No. I agree with you. They are called ‘Pinnacle’ for a reason. I worked hard for recluse and I’m proud that I have it.
---
I think the limit is 1 per character per week if I\`m not mistaken.
---
Somehow I never thought of that, thanks.
---
No it’s free with new light, which comes out on October 1st.
---
I just want a farting emote
---
Looks really good! Be notorious hunter
---
Ok which ones? As I’ve seen silver only items never came back after the season they were released in ended. Ex: Thorn, spare rations ornament, etc
---
My group just did it last night and they typed out abbreviated codes
---
Maybe. I rarely play gambit. I’m more of a crucible player
---
Nothin’ holding us Titans down!!
---
We thought calling him Bob would make him less scary. Now we're just terrified of Bobs.
---
I'll be honest, I don't mind most supers. They add some flavor and a different dynamic. I'll also think that completely removing them from PVP would also greatly enhance the game. They could take it either way.
---
The one thing I will say, is why do the roaming supers last so long? I swear the striker titan is at least a minute. Not even exaggerating. I'm really curious who has the decision making power over there, because there is a point where they looked at this shit and went "Yup. Seems good to me!"
---
Gjallarhorn I think it's spelled. D1 weapon
---
Shaxx tells me that I'm his favorite.
---
If the entire universe of Destiny was available to explore, this would be a great* way of reaching other planets without a ship!
---
**Great with a lot of planning ahead and careful timing of jumps*
---
Possibly! I’ll update or make another one in shadowkeep
---
It took 30 min but i managed to survive the ZOOM
---
they could still give us a ingame lfg system.
---
either a chat where you say what lvl and weapons you want for what raid and if newbies are fine or " experienced only".
---
or just a lobby system where you can join and open lobbies. with tags where you also can say what you want or dont. when you are 6 you decide if its all good and start or kick ppl who didnt fkin read the tag. kinda like on the website but ingame and better.
---
same for other activities, even for those which have matchmaking. sometimes you just dont want some randos and want to be as efficient as possible. 
---
including the OPTION to solo play some matchmade activities, would be nice.
---
but since everyone is fine with 3rd party stuff being essential parts of the game, its unlikely to happen.
---
(those 3rd party things are great too but having those INGAME would be fkin awesome)
---
It's not a lie lol just because you're struggling doesn't mean it's not possible. I was doing it in IB, Miltias, Fighting Lion, Doomsday, during the Revelery - my clan can confirm I did it within 2 days.
---
I get it, you're salty - doesn't mean it's not possible.
---
"Boop"
---
Gjallarhorns
---
ppl dont dislike lfg, they prefer a solid lfg ingame. also i dont think this guy knows what matchmaking actually means.. if he does hes not the smartest
---
100% luck ah of course so my planned multikills on capture zones were lucky too and not me intentionally rolling up to 3+ players on a zone to approach them with my GL ammo hm?
---
use jotuun
---
I tried using is, but he only real use is final boss CoS to survive while meleeing the weird hive bathers.
---
Nope, just from turning in her daily bounties
---
I heard sayin they got it from when they finished a forge
---
100% this. Can't wait to see people's K/Ds plummet. ;)
---
Sounds like something someone who crutches bottom tree striker would say
---
Orpheus Rigs with Traction and Special Ammo Finder, 11 days before 2.0. Of course. 
---
Still gettin’ em. But dang.
---
Whatever you say bud
---
Unironically my favorite exotic weapon
---
Thank you for correction!
---
And here I am not even able to draw a self portrait of my eye in High School.
---
Incredible work!
---
Lumina is like [Moira from Overwatch](https://www.nerfnow.com/comic/2197).
---
The only exotics I don't have in this video is jotunn, 1k, anarchy, lumiarch, and acrius.
---
None of those can drop from zur.
---
Yes, they count for the step. Although it may not go through until you play another match.
---
Yes
---
I fell like it’s more like doc from rainbow 6 siege
---
This is how dregens are made
---
Thanks man, really helps. Im at 8/20 bounties and have reset my valor 3 times. But i'm close to 4 times and with double valor this week and triple valor next week i feel like i can get this done.
---
“Oh h-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA”
---
famous last words of a hunter before meeting her fate
---
All of those exotics are either quest, specific drop, raid drop
---
WOAH HOW YOU DO THAT
---
Liars dont drop from the engram
---
They may have changed it recently and I just don’t remember it but I thought xur didn’t sell annual pass exotics?
---
You do not have to get to lvl 50.  You just need to open the Dreaming City.  Speed run the missions if you can and just get them done, not need to kill everything in sight.  Once the Dreaming City is open the invitation quest from Benedict should be available. and while working on it you will get your drop for Volunder.  
---
If your hunter and titan are not lvl 50s, you should be able to equip your thunderlord and horror story, if you have them, once you reach lvl 30.  If you deleted them rebuy them on the warlock, if you ever got them.  Those weapons are equipable at lvl 30 regardless of light lvl of the weapon, so it bumps your light up to a lvl that will allow you to run through most missions.
---
Wearing that same D1 MoT shirt right now.
---
Girls your DMS will be full.😆
---
0\_o *daaaaaaamn*. I want one.
---
Goldie is the most fun hunter super change my mind
---
You just never quit do you....
---
I only got back into Destiny 2 when forsaken dropped.  In a match I may only use it once... but that's just because I'm still working on all these damn quests and masterworks.  I'll take 2 kills with my Regime instead of 3 with a super right now.
---
I feel like that was a Leeroy Jenkins kinda moment.
---
Wait when was Dawnblade that good? I thought that was fairly recet
---
Nevermind. Found it. Thanks guys :)
---
Is it a quest that you need the one on Mars or can you get it on Titan?
---
Let’s raid it :)
---
nigga why you gotta reference jojo
---
After being disappointed that I didn't get shit from doing the weekly challenges, Xur gives me exactly what I was looking for, Skullfort. Sorry for calling you bad names after you sold Chromatic Fire for the 3rd time in 6 weeks but seriously, don't do that shit again.
---
Does he know that yet! (awkward...!) 😎
---
Hate's a strong word, my dude. Why do you dislike it/them so much? It's been around for decades and is simply an older version of T-posing, both of which are harmless and spark some in game rivalry. I actually love it's existence as it spurs me on to fight harder. Not just to win, but to prove my skill against a cocky opponent. It's like a modern day version of throwing down the guantlet. He bagged and declared a duel, so I will accept it and defeat him.
---
must be bhind the bushes
---
Since jokers wild
---
It's not just a destination
---
So uh...I'mma ask the more important community questions here for my hungry folks:
---
Who would you bang? Shaxx or Cayde and if so are you single?
---
as in... still sells it?
---
You too?
---
It’s for two completions for some reason
---
Blue shirt is shaxx, I'm hundo P Cayde!
---
Lol this guy you only need like 50 precision kills with a hand cannon for ace.
---
I run a 1080ti , im consistently in the 90-120 fls range depending on population. In the tower I average around 80. I rarely get the full 144hz. I have all settings at ultra though, V-sync off an no framerate cap. You're not going to average 144 fps no matter how good you're card is unless you lower your settings
---
The sandbox is great fun until the first guy gets his super, then the whole game just becomes a rolling shitfest of one shot roaming supers
---
BrianMoncus just dm him on Instagram and see what he says
---
Anyone wanna be my Best friend?
---
Have fun with that blue and one planetary material.
