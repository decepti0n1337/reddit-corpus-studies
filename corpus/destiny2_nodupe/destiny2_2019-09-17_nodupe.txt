Then theres the people who will pay over $500 dollars for luna or notforgotten. Its sad.

Multikill clip and Rapid hit, its a midnight coup on steroids
---
What about rapid hit and rampage or rapid hit and kill clip ?
---
And reasons like that is why I left that sub!
---
Circle-face!
---
Yep, sums up my experiences with hunters + the times when all they do is jump in the air with shotguns.
---
I personally hate tracking weapons. It's a "no skill, free kill" thing that is really annoying to fight against. Right now the Jotunn is the worst one for me. The tracking is aggressive and with it being a one shot kill is even worse.
---
Shits so boring I fall asleep at my desk
---
I hate hunturds
---
Jotuhn feels kinda cheesy sometimes, but I'm able to dodge it most if the times. There are a lot of kinda broken things rn. Just find what suits you best and go with it.
---
Me gusta.

***Why is Cayde the Jack of Spades and not the Ace***
---
the fuckin chicken from Moana
---
Cayde cool but what did hawthorn ever do
---
The infamous latency pills. Good shit.
---
It’s funnier because most of the time that lone guardian gets killed by someone else before the barrage even hits them so it’s extra pointless.
---
I believe it's 960, with a seasonal artifact that has no cap.

Nice, I haven't had the opportunity to get into reckoning since the changes since I'm deployed, but I would like to shoot for a better roll on SR and to try and get the shotty with 1-2 punch. If  you're shooting for glimmer, farming chests and using a rainmaker while you're running around helps alot too, it's usally what I do along with speed running strikes to obtain glimmer when I run low.
---
Welcome to destiny, this happens every dlc m8
---
I do this every time, without fail. I even try to jump through the hoop at the end.
---
Thats a shit joke but I stand behind your username 100% so have an upvote!
---
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOo
---
Lmao you are so funny 🤣🤣lol
---
I do this every time. Run on the log, attempt to jump through the hoop, and fail and fall down.
---
I’m dripping
---
Yup. I'm super close to getting the 21% delirium. I just need to get from legend to a reset. Everyone I get teamed up with is just running around getting kills with bows, not picking up motes, invading(and getting stomped) at every possible chance, not picking up teammates, etc.
---
I don't like it tbh, my main reason being I like to keep low level gear like the starting gear just to compare how I was back then and stuff but nows it's all gonna be whatever cos its all 750
---
I am a reaper.  With full reaper glow.  My job is to kill shit.  Your job is to pick up the motes and bank them.  That’s how it works. 
---

---
You had better believe flashing motes triggers me.  If I’m killing more, banking more and doing more DPS on the prime then something is wrong and it’s not me.  
---
I hate this grind for reckoner. 
---
Kill me. 
---
Please.
---
There’s a moon in this game?!
---
Fisky...
---
I thought I was the only one who did this LOL
---
Lmfao
---
All it does for bows is increase the zoom magnification.  Usually it increases damage falloff range but bows don't have falloff so it just increases the zoom level
---
More like every time I see a log in the EDZ
---
Was going to mention this. Only time I don’t use the log is if the enemy is on the beach.
---
I’m no tierwhore
---
Yep
---
&gt; What exactly do I need to get to be current? If I have to buy like a years worth of DLC and spend 60 hours doing quests I think I will pass on the game.
---
It costs (or for PC, will cost in 2 weeks) $25 for currently released DLC and $35 for the DLC releasing on October 1. Don't feel like you have to buy everything just for the sake of having everything, though! I highly recommend actually looking into what you are buying, as you do not need to own all previous DLCs to play future ones. [More detailed summary of DLC here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/cyb7pc/how_dlc_works_in_destiny_2/?)
---
&gt;have to redownload the game again on Steam? When it that occurring?
---
October 1, when the game moves off of battle net and on to steam.
---
Am titan main, can confirm
---
I am not sure I understand the question. Shadowkeep is a DLC (downloadable content), meaning it's an add on to an existing game. You need the existing game, Destiny 2, in order to play the add on, Shadowkeep. As a result, you need to download both the base game and Shadowkeep if you want to play Shadowkeep.
---
Yea but destiny is a game revolving around rng and loot, and it's not like this is raid levels of low chances either.
---
That being said I disagree with your statement I ran nothing but forges till I got la monarque I earned that bow wanna use jotun against people? farm for it.
---
Wanna not die to it? Practice sound and sight ques to help you avoid it and dont rag on people just cause they enjoy the gun, that's all I'm saying.
---
Pretty sure the blueberries in my comp teams were eating paint chips tonight...
---
Coldheart is fucking disgusting. Like fr, it's nasty. Pve and pvp. Get it
---
Yeah I'm pretty shit, and I still outclass these guys 9 times out of 10. I know they're bad if they're doing even worse then I am.
---
Absolutely, and through the hoops. And if I don't get through the window on Cathedral of Scars I immediately quit the match. Thats the rules.
---
It has to be jumping on,and off fast while doing a spin to pretend you do a flip
---
Yes it will.  Terrible.
---
I mean, I’m pretty decent, 2 KD using decent guns, OEM is just cheap. Seems like a free win sometimes.
---
Thanks
---
You have to run up the long and jump through the hoop
---
Swing and a miss
---
Even still the tracking part is big busted
---
Lol this guy plays gambit
---
plus a free overhauled dawg
---
Yeah, the warlock is patterned off of the traditional MMO mage role with some minor clerical skills under certain trees.
---
Titan can kind of support with their rally barrier and a specific void melee ability but are more the 'tank' class.
---
Just bear in mind that while the classes are based on tank/rogue/mage they are not as strict as more traditional RPG roles.
---
At the end of the day, your main job is going to be shooting stuff.
---
Warlocks don't stand in the back trying to avoid agro while watching the other players HP, Titans don't stand in front of the boss trying to absorb all the damage and Hunter.....well Hunters are the DPS/Rogue archetype so they actually do mostly what that role implies.
---
*\*loads Thorn with malicious intent\**
---
What is this gun, i need to recolor it
---
Yeah that tends to happen every time it says it failed to comment. So as soon as I get one to post I refresh and delete all but the newest
---
One of us.
---
You shoulda 1v1’d. And equipped a full level 10 set from the campaign, with some green weapons, then just emote the whole time, and after he leaves the match just send peach emoji after peach emoji after peach emoji in that chat. Cuz screw that dude.
---
N
---
Damn that gun is dope tho, holy shit!
---
Then jump thru the hoop
---
EVERY SINGLE TIME! And I always try to finish with a flawless jump through the ring at the end :)
---
it's just very bad lag, that's why they aren't shooting him either. the ones he can damage are the only ones that shoot back.
---
yup, think Graviton lance and Sunshots also drop from strikes now also. since they we're part of faction rallies (RIP them) they added them back. perfect time also since sunshot is getting buffed in shadowkeep
---
Thank you!
---
per 2 per connection proplem most likely have it happen from time to time myself really late at night when the mojority of the my area is sleeping
---
Yea exactly that. U can even use lumina hand cannon and than u got everything for healing+support. Maybe switch it for tractor cannon for dmg boost
---
Bungie fireteam app works well for me tho...
---
Indeed!
---
Don’t take this the wrong way but you look really stubby in those cosplays and I think it’s really funny
---
I run up the log then aim to leap through the hoop. Damn sonic is coded into me now
---
Well I just got my "crutch in pvp" like last week can I use the gun for a week before shitty players jump all over me for it
---
This is why we wanted a buff
---
Might have to do some farming when i get back from vacation!
---
She's pissed because your cape is cooler than her poncho.
---
The quest line that boosts you to 690 for emperor calus requires you to complete the forsaken story, up till the point where you enact revenge and are then prompted to restore an awoken talisman for access to the dreaming city.
---
Then you can receive the invitation from Werner or Benedict, on the barge on nessus or in the tower. If you dont complete the forsaken story you will wonder why you can't get their invitation.
---
Their questline will give you 1 item for each slot that is 690 - you will only receive one and there will be no replacements. If you destroy or otherwise lose it (like one of my friends did), you will not be able to replace it and will need to rely on prime engrams to eventually choose your missing slot.
---
Or, when shadowkeep launches, you'll just be 750 in general.
---
Clearly they turned off their "die move"  then accidentally flipped it back on.
---
Jump through the hoop for +10 shitty team mates.
---
It's on the roadmap
---
What error code? Could be a DDoS.
---
What does that mean? How can I find the roadmap?
---
When releasing a new season, Bungie release a roadmap of the schedule for that season. The latest one is found in the twab
---
I'd hit that, she sounds like a dirty girl
---
Mate, if I slide off the log while trying to jump on it I know the game is already lost.
---
ty :3
---
I'm confused by what you mean about transparency... They've been pretty upfront about what they are doing: https://www.polygon.com/2019/6/18/18682603/destiny-2-new-light-content-free-to-play-raid-crucible-gambit-strikes
---
You'll be able to buy forsaken after Oct. 1, when shadowkeep launches. They have disabled all other purchases on bnet, so you'll have to wait. Not sure the reason, likely to make the move to steam easier.
---
Is not is correct
---
mats would i say :) i think gladd or sweetcicle did a video on it :)
---
i cant find anything there about why forsaken and the other dlcs are not on steam.
---
That's me
---
Can't have two exotics bud.
---
She just quits, doesn't she?
---
1) Currently, Forsaken is unavailable for purchase due to the move to Steam. Shadowkeep, if you purchase it, will give you all previous DLC, Forsaken included.
---
2) Doesn't matter if you buy Shadowkeep now or on Oct. 1, as there are no ore-order bonuses.
---
3) You'll probably get close to two weeks of gameplay (raids included) in the F2P version, as it does include Curse of Osiris and Warmind (first two DLC).
---
"matching"
---
Maybe play intelligently and don't push someone who is tracking you? What's the damage boost anyways 5%? Lol
---
You're about 2 months too late.
---
@painisacupcake bruh im stoked waiting
---
You deserve it for using LoW
---
Yea it shouldn't be bad, recluse doesn't require too many wins
---
yeah, it's more the stress and anxiety of not wanting to lose!
---
Happy Resurrection Day Guardian!
---
[Vigorous clapping]
---
hmm, I might have to risk Fabled at the price of getting my last 25 points much faster! Thanks for the help!
---
I totally get you
---
Thank you buddy!
---
Im not sure, I saw literally nothing for several pages on either of the BL subreddits. I think this is just a karmafarm post
---
enjoy playing bl3 then and get outta heeereee :*
---
Lol they already are.....
---
No because game licenses don’t transfer over
---
Just ignore how they made it epic game store  exclusive and got rid of the windows release for it and don’t mind that bungee had recently separated from Activision who had stop bungie from making the game the wanted to make
---
Not exactly, but its fun.
---
It has a cool sound effect while it shoots.
---
The perk,  consequential-precision hits or precision kills generate nanites at target location that attack near by targets.
---
Targets hit by nanites take more damage from outbreak perfect. The more nanites, the more damage.
---
5 man team and it can be used as a boss weapon. There are vids of it.
---
Don’t need to farm, it’s a quest. Pretty short one too if you can find a good team for Zero Hour.
---
That’s because borderlands is entirely PvE so it’s incredibly easy to balance
---
Bye
---
I took a look at your Reddit account to get a little background on someone that would make a post like this and I wasn’t disappointed
---
Ahhhh so I will need to wait
---
WARLOCK DAWN🅱️LADES RISE U🅱️
---
Does Antoine know what is this shader? :)
---
To be honest, I just resigned to my fate and sat there.
---
Didn't even cross my mind to tie the match because, well...
---
*I didn't know you could do that*
---
Yeah, I let any lone person on the enemy team tie the match, so neither of us lose glory. And if they are a really good sport, I'll let them win ;)
---
Rahool still isn't satisfied.
---
The weep lol it was a lost sector during a faction rally
---
I still have my original NTB
---
I use the Slowvabomb because, I don't want to use Dawnblade. It is just to easy to fly around and get kill after kill. I don't see the fun in that. Most matches I don't even use my super. I want to improve in my gunplay and positioning not press F and win the match. Call me old fashioned but I hate being killed time after time by bottom tree strikers so why should I become part of the problem.
---
You da real MVP
---
Menagerie as well
---
Thanks! Lol yea I hope that birthday luck kicks in
---
Definitely the shader I use, all black with dope-ass space glow.
---
Loot exploit? I’ve had d2 since launch idk what you mean?
---
I did that on my 18th but my team and I ran through all the raids
---
It's not a glitch though and gearbox have said nothing about patching it
---
This is, by far, the most annoying thing in this game. Playing with randoms, even though it's a FIRETEAM-BASED GAME, that never revive.
---
It can, but I wouldn’t hit a goddamn thing... not the best with rapid-fire.
---
Shadow queef
---
Can’t wait for chad o keefe to be the next destiny meme so i can say I understood that reference
---
Looks like I know what I'm doing later. Thanks!

Use LFG on the phone app. There are usually people willing to run it.
---
The tears of guardians weren’t enough to quench his bloodlust

I’m still missing Risk Runner - the main one I actually want.
---
Awww I miss that cave
---
virgin keep and the chad o'keefe
---
Ф
---
FOR DARCI I used the OG leviathan spawn. Just drop in, pick off the honour guard, collect the ammo and repeat
---
Oh, don't take me wrong. They totally dunked on me 4 on 1 right after I was solo.
---
More often than not, people don't realize that players leave the match because there's little to no warning (does it even notifies the enemy team?).
---
It's also something bungo should fix as a QoL. It's really hard to notice the little white text on the bottom left when you're more preoccupied about whether there's a Beloved scoping 'round the corner
---
Top tree
---
I ended up learning of that trick at real late, since I ended up with a helmet for a sentry set but the arms werent dropping. I was grinding up until now but it's too late.
---
It was a learning experience none the less!
---
One can only hope.
---
Chang my mind but hunters are literally the class made for hand cannon usage 🤷🏽‍♂️
---
What the heck is that gun?!
---
Down vote for lore fail.
---
Loot cave loot cave loot cave loot cave loot cave loot cave
---
If you mean him being confused.  It's probably because it's a silent weapon so all they hear is the explosion right on them.
---
It may or may not have been! I bumped into quite a few people in the same scenario as me, so the grind wasnt too horrible! 
---
The true triumph was the friendship we made along the way!
---
Ohhhh okay ty
---
Traveler resurrected him, he has no memories of his past. Why would any of the vanguard be pissed at him.
---
Ohhh okay ty
---
Nah
---
I bet it will have useless speed demon perk or public events perk.
---
I solo que to mythic 2 using trust only for the Luna’s howl quest bro. try it again or use counterbalance stock on it
---
You on Xbox mate?
---
Except the D2 my friends play is dust 2
---
We’ve been tricked, backstabbed, and quite possibly bamboozled
---
So great!! Hahaha
---
Now that’s funny
---
You should've put on the last picture in the corner "Marked for Vengeance"
---
?
---
I got it on my first try
---
F
---
Lol, came from Borderlands 2 to Destiny. The trading glitch in Bl2 was on a whole new level. ^^
---
The game doesn’t go free until Oct 1st
---
nah if somone dodges a 1v1 i just immediately assume they are bad and scared to lose but maybe thats just me
---
Man I just went with your post title and thought I'd see if or when you notice it. I should have accounted for the Trump voter brain. My bad.
---
Looks like titans have to kill yet another god. How many gods have we killed now? 3?
---
The game is not f2p today.
---
Heart damage is troll.
---
We have been hoodwinked
---
titans forever.
---
Well yeah this post is a troll - but this is not: https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48155
---
Everyone is being brought up to 750 for shadowkeep
---
Watch out, crota titans are coming for dat ass again
---
I had a game like this on saturday and some guy was chill then titan smashed, how rude
---
There’s an occasional bug that results in you not being visible to the enemy team and being unable to damage them with weapons. You can still damage them with abilities like grenades. What’s throwing me here, however, is that you *were* able to damage 1 guy on the enemy team but not anyone else. Really weird.
---
Looks like this is the week I get my SMG and then hopefully the Frost gun and I will be Wayfarer!
---
When is it available?
---
Or kill clip/ outlaw
---
I’m with you console brother! We’re losers together!
---
That's a nice exotic engram you have there titan, it would be a smash if it turned into legendary boots... for a warlock
---
The hell did you expect. An exotic? Its a daily bounty.
---
For real. Yeah sure they can be fun but there are other things...
---
Wasting peoples time when I get rewards I’m ight
---
not playing useless titan helps alot for dmg.
---
Like maybe novabomb or golden gun.
---
I’ll let you fuck me tho
---
If it makes you feel any better, the huckleberry one is one of the best (also, ironically one of the hardest to get as it only drops from heroic adventures I think). Instant full reloads on every kill.
---
I wonder if theres a Chad O'Keefe out there that plays destiny and thought shadowkeep sounds strangely like his name
---
Then you'll get 3 drops this week, and 4 next week instead of getting 4 this week and 5 next.
---
The Holy One
---
Imagine amnesiatic Adolf Hitler just respawned  and went into the home of a Jewish man.
---
Do you think he is going to get decked, or do you think he is going to get asked if he is amnesiatic?
---
Eksist?
---
Not enough punching to be Titan.
---
But it doesn’t even look like a normal shank :(
---
Forsaken should be $24.99 USD on Steam (as well as Xbox/PS4) Oct 1st  [https://twitter.com/DestinyTheGame/status/1169331957647302656](https://twitter.com/DestinyTheGame/status/1169331957647302656)
---
I saw that today too!! Got sooo excited!
---
Yeah, pretty much.
---
Thank you so much! Sorry I dont use twitter so I for sure would not have seen this. i appreciate your help though!
---
Do the items come out with the current power level or is the power locked in at the level when you got them?
---
And of course you'd turn in 3 exotics and the bastard would give you the same copy...of the exotic you have equipped!
---
The worst!
---
r/fireteams is a popular one as well.
---
Also, r/destinysherpa for matching new raiders with experienced raiders.

"What's this? Other players having a laugh, it's down to me to ruin it!" - RainbowComet, 2019
---
I ran out of time at Gahlran, the last thing I needed to get the title. I spent months grinding the rest of the triumphs I didn't have, including a crucible weapon, for nothing. I'm actually upset and angry. There's nothing worse than impotent rage. I'm almost at the point of uninstalling destiny. This is supposed to be fun, not a frustrating piece of shit job.
---
Supposedly divinity is the raid exotic so it doesn't make much sense to have a quest to get it. Unless they went with a legend of acrius style quest but based on the last 3 raids I doubt it
---
It was Petra. At the end of the campaign you are awarded Petras gun, and it says "this is the gun that pulled the trigger on uldren" or something of that sorts.
---
Divindy XD
---
As a warlock jump, jump, float through hoop
---
Or you could just grind like the rest of us instead of being lazy and draining the fun from the game
---
armor and shaders pls, this looks incredible
---
Its vesper of radius. If you rewind a couple seconds before and paused the video, the warlock did that one solar drop and immediately rift. The warlock was also wearing a blue and gold robe seen  [here](https://i.imgur.com/lLN5zGa.jpg)
---
Playing rn just doing it tonight
---
My guess is a vesper of radius buff. So far we haven’t really covered exotic armor buffs in the twabs and absolutely no one uses this exotic so I imagine it will get buffed.
---
I like em, but just fyi next time : r/DestinyFashion
---
Why am I imagining Chad O’Keefe as a stereotypically Irish Sean Bean lol
---
Who knows? I hope we do tho
---
First 24:02, now Chad O Keefe.
---
Anour is objectively worse, killing for the greater good and labeling it justice
---
Hot damn just reminded me mines next week
---
A little bit intimidated?
---
I aim to scare my foes.
---
It took us tine to master but we have it now.
---
Because the armor looks better then the one Shaxx has and you can only get one key a week so it’s better to stack keys now and have them ready.Plus if you’re like me you’ll have thousands of crucible tokens to spend.
---
Midnightsmith is my favourite IMO but right now I'm using gambit steel so I can match my friend.
---
Can't take a joke apparently.

Then it works! If only they were still selling it, I only have it on PC and not PS4, PS4 is my primary Cross Save account now

Finally got NF first season back from season 1 but high rank comp wasn’t fun at all:/

Upvote for Chad O'Keef
---
Yeah i feel the same way about recluse
---
Pve gets too easy so I choose different guns
---
I’d buy you a chad okeefe if I could, sadly, I cannot
---
Tom Hanks
---
Yes you are very wrong. Everything goes to 750 when shadowkeep launches, old guardians and their gear, as well as the drops for kinderguardians.
---
Well as u can hear on nessus “death follows u”...
---
