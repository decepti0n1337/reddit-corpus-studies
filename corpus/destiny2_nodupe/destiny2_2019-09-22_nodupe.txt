Fair enough.

---
Btw, it's "said my _piece_".
---
To "hold my _peace_" means to stay quiet about one‚Äôs objections.
---
Something you probably should have done instead of angerly replying to every comment since this entire thread was just meant to be a funny joke.
---

---
I know right? That's what made me wonder about this
---
Fucker better stay away from my cores! I‚Äôve only just worked out how to use and accumulate them properly this season.

I'm gonna write an angry letter.

Does my flair not make it obvious

Fake news that‚Äôs not a couch
---
I got of a wallpaper app on destiny all it said was about bungie
---
It does... I just wanted to say it for once :(
---
No one never said being good?
---
May be. That feeling, when you like the game, you played your handcannon a lot and feel it good, and then you feel really really bad in pvp games. I will surely play a lot more pvp matches and will decide what to do.
---
Just wanted to clear if this game has a looot of cheaters and I shouldn't play pvp. Now I get that it was just my first exp at pvp. Will get better and see :-)
---
No. This game has very few cheaters and all of them are in the comp playlist.
---
I would run OEM but the perks that I have on it is garbage üòî
---
5 per character.
---
Oh yea no doubt
---

When I left ps4 it was the exact same

Well it's true that it only works in low to mid level games doesn't mean it doesn't have *any* advantages in a duel. Can't just disregard those situations

Also, I think, for now, when I got a vanile version of the game, "better devils" is jot the worst gun in game. While I can't get forsaken, do you know any better handcannons I can get now? Thanks for your replies.
---
It‚Äôs perk is unlimited ammo but it doesn‚Äôt do any damage
---
Basically, while he has it on Xbox. He does have to buy it again for PC. Without it, he can still use stuff he got from Forsaken on Xbox. He just can‚Äôt access Forsaken content (Maps, Strikes, Adventures, etc).  Kinda blegh. But $$$ rules.
---
Awesome. Titan now please?

Doctors **HATE** him!

I guess I asked for this

I‚Äôll miss you buddy.

One of the reason I came to playing after weeks of not playing lol
---
I‚Äôve just got it. Starting the steps to unlock Black Armory Quest. Thanks!
---
Looks good to me. People that call for nerfs because of PVP are idiots.
---
it gives you access to gambit prime and the black armory and the forges, that you wouldn‚Äôt have had if you had forsaken without the annual pass.
---
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET

Only tangentially. I‚Äôll put pictures of both the baby and the ghost up in 6 months when she‚Äôs actually here

The black armory weapons were more along the lines of what I think of with weapons. Dreaming city is cool aesthetically, but I feel like a shoe horn was just taped to every gun.
---
Black armory 100%, especially with the Amethyst veil shader
---
It would suck to live right below the tower, you‚Äôd constantly have dead bodies falling on your head.

I killed two last night in some IB and felt like i could headbutt a train irl... I mean did anybody at bungie playtest that super? At all?

Oh okay thank you

Maybe atheon yo
---
Sorry!
---
All d2 players are playing borderlands 3 right now. Lol
---
I just looked at this post at 10:48
---
Just use missile at teabag an watch the salt
---
Indeed.co.edu.uk
---
Black Armory hands down. They are very aesthetically pleasing and all the weapons perform very very well. I could pick up any one of them and know that I would be able to compete in any activity. There are really only a few of the dreaming city weapons I actually enjoy.
---
They are adjusting recoil on a few things aswell as rapid fire pulses are supposedly getting a slight buff as well as things like redrixs is gonna be really good other then that i havent heard much
---
I was like ‚Äúit‚Äôs not 1am‚Äù and then I realized time zones exist.
---
Lookin like a bunch of mass wipes.
---
First of all, how dare you
---
So autos will still be bad in pvp? bummer. Least I can use my break neck in pve
---
Those guards by the bridge are just like "what the fuuuuck..?"
---
im waiting until 1 am then
---
I'm saying competitive balance is impossible to achieve especially in  p2p hosting environment
---
additionaly it will impact the entire game, not just comp
---
which I also play sure that fun thing you don't think it's important. Frankly, I don't know why else would play a video game
---
Oh no! Is that you. I'm sorry.
---
Idk why you don‚Äôt just dodge the grenades when they throw them at you.
---
I have forsaken but I didn't buy the annual pass with forsaken. Does this mean that I'll still have my forsaken stuff but just wont have the newest 2 expansions?
---
And now I got the image of Guardian Caboose in my head.
---
Maybe I do no tplay competitive that much, but [What do I know about pvp with my sh\*t stats, eh?](https://destinytracker.com/d2/profile/pc/FrozenStar-2976)   
---
Once again, for me, OEM is useless and replacing it made my stats much better. It does not provide any benefit for me. It is good vs bronze-gold players who have no idea how to play, and it is very poor choices vs platinum+ players.  
---
Not my style. Other options are better for me. Simple as that. I do not need overshield if the enemy team is dead.
---
I think it‚Äôs a level of those reward.
---
&gt; It won't activate if you are dead.
---
Guess it's time to run Stag.
---
Oh*
---
I got it randomly, just gotta be lucky man
---
He was probably leading you to Gjallarhorn, and now we won't ever get it back. :(
---
Guess it's time to run exotics which actually help you **kill** your opponent instead of dying to him.
---
at 730 light there's no need to infuse the borealis though, mission is only 690
---
For a second I thought the kitchen role was a hammer and I just thought "FUCK"
---
Thank you. I got it at a shop called Game here in the UK.
---
Oh that guardian rejected my date request? Guess I'll die.
---
You could join a clan. Some clans are pretty big. Mine is small enough, about 20ppl, not everyone active in the game but we help each other when we can. We use discord to talk to each other even when we‚Äôre not online so we can set things up for later and stuff.
---
If there‚Äôs no one from there on to help me, I usually use the bungie app. It has a fireteam section where you can post what activity you‚Äôre doing, how many you need, if you have a mic etc and there are usually a few people around doing the same thing as you.
---
Works great in PVE.
---
Haha. Could imagine Papa Smurf having a serious sit down chat with guardians like, now I'm trusting you not to do this anymore, the children of the last city have enough trauma to deal with, without their heroes comitting mass suicide on a whim"
---
*pulls out trust and shoots themselves*
---
Hunters are imo very strong class and I would rather face a six stack full of OEM Strikers than a six stack of high mobility Hunters with Stompess and shotgunning you from the space. I've just noticed that when people argue about that topic which class is strongest, they seem to omit one simple fact - a skilled player can make any class strong. I've seen matches where OEM Strikers get annihilated by a skilled hunter or warlock and vice versa. Encountered OEM Strikers who were absolute beasts in pvp but also those who were potatoes.
---
https://i.imgur.com/soLaIph.jpg
---
Not until october
---
Well bungie devs are too lazy for that. They cannot even fix grave issues like matchmaking and weapons balancing.
---
Hunters naturally have a strong neutral game and I still believe a dodge is the most useful class ability but they seem to lack, similarly to warlock any exceptional exotic as OEM. If each of the three main classes have one with similar abilities, then it would make the overall experience for everyone far better.
---
Cringe.
---
i get your point, its everyone's to give their all or goof around.  
---
i didnt say players that use it are the blight but the things them selfe.  
---
hope this gets across the right way.

Those are a pain in the ass

Wym not power level? As in they won't be powerful?? Dude if ima have my exotics back I'd want them to be powerful not light level 5 lol but I do agree, all of those would be amazing to have back here in d2! 
---
Also, for any of u sick bastards out there who dare say: "RiSk RuNnEr iS tHe SaMe aS *Zhallo SuperCell*" fuck off! Not it is not. Risk runner is like the idiot cousin nobody talks about in the family. Fuck outta here, dont ever compare my baby zhallo to something so low üôÑüôÑ!

There should be a big neon sign during the whole match saying "CLASH = Kill people, CAPTURE = Take zones" because hoping that people will use their common sense clearly doesnt work much in praxis lol

Nice! What you rockin' in that beauty?

Caydes will is tedious but the ace of spades is decent and fun to use

I spent 20 minutes balancing the floating ball on some random guys head everywhere he went in the tower yesterday. This is Destiny at its‚Äô finest.

People atill AFK in Rumble?
---
I use it because me having fun is more important than what strangers on the internet think about me
---
Tragic.
---
Do I need the forsaken dlc or can I skip that
---
I wouldn‚Äôt skip Forsaken it‚Äôs one of, if not, the best DLCs we‚Äôve gotten in Destiny and it adds so much to the game.
---
Yeah, and Zhalo has this annoying sound when it fires
---
You monster
---
no jesus christ comp does not need to get any easier. its a joke right now it takes actually no effort to get fabled and legend isnt even THAT hard anymore. Comp should be difficult, not for everyone
---
Hard Light was primary, Queenbreaker's Bow was special, now look at them
---
Yet I rarely see more than 3 guardians in the tower at any time
---
I mean everything will just to 750 with the expansion so just a matter of time
---
If I delete my main character right now, would I have to play through the whole story again for new light or does it skip that
---
If you‚Äôve reset a couple times you can buy one from the drifter. Just go to the second page in his inventory.
---
So badly
---
That's not a Retold Tale lmao, you'd think you know what was killing you if they're on your ass every time
---
On that, I‚Äôm actually not sure. I know that they‚Äôre altering the start for New Light, but I‚Äôm not sure how they‚Äôre altering the Red War story and year one dlc around that.
---
Bungie stated that if you disable cross save you will have to wait for 90 days to reenable it.  They want to discourage people from switching once they have chosen an account, but they also realize that people make mistakes and or sometimes need to change for what ever reason.
---
Levels are going away. So no need to worry about leveling them.
---
Khvostov is supposed to be returning to the game via the first mission from D1. Hopefully they bring back the exotic version as well.
---
Nice! I recently bought an oryx one myself
---
Why is this getting downvoted?? It‚Äôs really clunky to use now that memento mori goes away when you stow it. Have to play like a bitch in pvp to use it
---
I hated the jokers wild meta. Being able to use your super as a primary weapon totally ruined the game.
---
Would not be enough.
---
Comp only
---
On that step, I recommend saving your reset (I'm 90% sure tho)
---
What loadout for warlock would you recommend? I gave up on Vorgoth, had him down to 5% health left and died.
---
ü¶Äbungie is powerless against incompetent teammatesü¶Ä
---
Riskrunner is a sort of better sort of worse version of it
---
Well then oof, that sucks
---
In my opinion, the upcoming nerfs/buffs will make all the classes super useful. The weapons of light damage buff will be the biggest buff, but the crazy healing from well will still be super useful.
---
I give it another two weeks
---
Mine
---
THANK YOU. I've been looking all over for exactly what spot in a strike that they'll drop. I just want my sweet business catalyst üò≠
---
I never played first Destiny but this thing looks cooler than most exotic from vanilla D2.
---
Ugh. Thanks.
---
You don't have to do them on that step. When I got mine, I'd done 5 resets earlier in the season from doing all the IB armor quests and I essentially just skipped that step.
---
Infusing the same item into an identical item costs 5000 glimmer and that‚Äôs it.  No cores needed.
---
Nope.
---
I want new stuff
---
It still has a slower ttk than all the meta hand cannons with the perk active so I really wouldn‚Äôt call it god mode. God forbid we could have one single hand cannon that is consistent aaand fun to use.
---
By everything until forsaken you mean you have vanilla, curse of Osiris and warmind? If so those are technically base destiny, which means if you switch to pc you‚Äôll have those already. So you‚Äôll need to buy shadowkeep to be current and then you can go back and buy forsaken at a later date
---
First and last time Naruto running is allowed in Destiny
---
This is a sick combo. A must try in the everything.
---
:(
---
So why didn‚Äôt you google your own question me smarty pants?
---
- Don‚Äôt do it in Comp
---
- Run with teammates and try to mop up kills, guys they‚Äôve softened up 
---
- If you‚Äôre really struggling use Crimson, the pulse lets you walk the kill shot to the head
---
- Don‚Äôt focus on it, just play, the crit kills will come.
---
I've been trying to figure this out myself, from what I've heard I think we'll need to redownload
---
It took me a very long time to get a Last Man with 1-2, but I got the curated Emperor‚Äôs Courtesy very early on (4 CoS runs or so)
---
Nice bald spot
---
It‚Äôs not banned for being good, it‚Äôs banned because damage calculation is broken on close-range kills. It‚Äôs an error.
---
You can do it on a hunter too. Use a flux grenade
---
That is pretty damm good!
---
Type frequency in utube
---
And there's that one exotic you can equip to give yourslef an overshield to make you even harder to kill IF people attempted to try
---
To add to the point about taking time to get into, it has one of the longest "tutorials" of any game ever. You won't be able to play with friends for a few hours and after that the "real game" doesn't start until you hit High Rank after 20-30 hours. That's not to say it isn't really fun before that.
---
yea, no eternal warrior is disgusting w/ bottom tree striker.
---
Step your raid game up!!!
---
Man last word is busted you could pair that gun with a potato and make it work
---
Because it didn't have as many performance issues and wasn't put on Epic's launcher like 3 which people are still butthurt about. Only idiots base a game off of things like metacritic in 2019. Destiny 2's score is garbage and worse the Destiny 1's so by your rationale Destiny 2 is garbage. 
---
Do some actual RESEARCH instead of metacritic: the dirty anus of the review world. Maybe actually watch people play it. See the game for yourself. 
---
I dont owe you anything. I'm rarely nice to your type. I detest blind fanboys. Nothing personal. Just you all are insufferable in your denial that anything other then the one thing you like can be fun for others. Like I even said i'm gonna play both things and clearly like destiny myself and you still acted like a moronic fanboy and attacked because how dare I like anything else other than your lord and savior destiny.
---
To bake a Destiny 2 login screen from scratch you must first create the universe.
---
idk i think they were right to nerf auto reload, but they should have fixed this as well
---
Tbh most people don't do them cause they don't have enough people or time to waste playing through them. Me personally, I've tried them but haven't bothered going through another time. They just seem dull and lacking compared to the ones released in D1. Unfortunately, I think that's where bungie peaked with raids and haven't been able to emulate that level of raid. But that's just my own opinion and no doubt others will disagree.
---
Loaded Question if you expect orange and yellow bars, or if you‚Äôre in Gambit.

So make a raid that's nothing like a raid? So, the rest of the game?

Depends, if your just playing for a good time it doesn‚Äôt matter. If you want to get to like 750 with the minimal effort, waiting‚Äôs the way to go. If you just got started though, you could use this time to start building your collections of good Legendary‚Äôs and exotics. Welcome to the game either way.üëåüëå

I have the hunter set from pax 2017 but when I tried to build it I found out it had missing parts for the gjallarhorn. I sent in a request for replacement parts and am currently waiting for the email. Super excited to finish it up and put it on my shelf next to my kill tracker ghost!

You cant remap controls on console, only on PC

I dont care how good the limited set options are

Bungie‚Äôs idea of ‚Äúbalance‚Äù.
---
Let‚Äôs just top load the meta with a whole bunch of one shot kill weapons you don‚Äôt even really have to aim. That way unskilled players can feel competitive.
---
It‚Äôs not enough? Okay let‚Äôs add an exotic version in the energy slot that can also track and one shot kill with infinite range so you all you have to do is face one direction and hold the trigger down.

Lmao this shits so easy you can literally get away with anything and have quick finishes. People are so bad at easy stuff it kills me.
---
Makes sense
---
Not everyone has the time to do all those exotic quests, so they are probably asking if it‚Äôs worth the time, not whether the actual guns are worth it

In Destiny 1 I used the Ward of Dawn and made the mighty mistake of trying to throw a sticky grenade through the bubble.

---
what does firing lane do?
---
It won‚Äôt be as bad as you think for power level. The real grind will be armor mods and such
---
To start this game is not a rigorous grind. The grind to light shouldn‚Äôt take more than a month or two. And secondly not having prime engrams won‚Äôt affect you that much with the weekly and daily challenges and also the fact that planetary vendors will now give you drops at you power level not 20 below. So no the game will not become grindyer
