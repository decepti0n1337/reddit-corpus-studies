I mean, the Fanatic keeps yelling at you for being a murderer.  It's only fair that you be sent to Baron Jail.

I got my 1K on my first run
---
I saw a video of the lava lamp one, so there is certainly a way to do so
---
The kindled orchid hand cannon has huge potential to the best hand cannon around with the right roll, it‚Äôs definitely one to go for, same goes for the  blast furnace pulse rifle, and strikers hand sword, really each type has something for every player out there, those are just the ones that have gotten a lot of attention. If you have a weapon type preference look into what rolls are possible and grind them out üëç
---
What‚Äôre the rolls on the mask? Mine‚Äôs got a bunch of conflicting ammo and targetting perks that just don‚Äôt work together lol
---

---
I once killed an invader, then got sniped by a taken knight. I lost 15 motes.
---
hit me up if you want 
---

---
shame, sorry bud
---
I will when I‚Äôm done with the headshot final blows! (If I don‚Äôt forget lmfao) 
---
A Warframe update, Halo 5, Division, I've even heard people saying Fortnite would kill it... and now Anthem. 
---
Oh man so that's how Germany felt when Italy joined them in WW2.
---
It‚Äôs an understandable confusion. Gunslingers are not Hunters. Gunslingers are Gunslingers.
---
I‚Äôm just now getting into endgame, I only started playing two weeks ago. What is this in reference to?
---
Everyone's entitled to their own opinion, but the full game isn't even playable yet.
---
"Ya measly skunk!"

I use an armor set with 3 heavy ammo finders and i never seem to run out of machine gun ammo. So it seems like its working properly but maybe im just lucky
---
There‚Äôs some debate on whether heavy ammo finder works at all (there may be a bug with it), so I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it doesn‚Äôt work, or works differently, in gambit as that‚Äôs got some wonky things going on as it is. 
---
And drop rates themselves are probably different in gambit. Sometimes I do feel like it‚Äôs either feast or famine. 
---
Hey man no worries. We can agree to disagree and still be friends :D
---
when you carry your team in gambit
---
I do did the savathuns song nightfall as a 2 man w brawler all knives including the boss and it was a score run.
---
Got an erentil with accelerated coils, firmly planted and high impact reserves. The thing can 1-shot people at hand cannon ranges.
---
I was not aware of the existence of such a shell.
---
Blade barrage what now ?
---
Yes. I got a good rental, my car is getting fixed, I ate lunch.. it's a good day.
---
When your team mates just sit and look at the primeval and do nothing
---
Raid exotic: One Thousand Voices
---
Its better now compared to what it was before. Tbh, no roaming super should be able to 1 shot another roaming super, there's literally no counter-play if it does.
---
Nova warp was a 1 shot AOE monster that lasted for a long time and there was no real counter-play when faced against someone using this super.
---
The way I see Nova Warp, its a high risk high reward super. You still have the potential of wiping out the enemy team, it may not be as easy as it was before but that's how it should be. 
---
The same can be said for Spectral Blades. This super also needs a nerf as the subclass gives you the tools to setup a perfect super so it should also be high risk high reward.
---
it's all good, it adds to the lore of my head canon. hahaha.

I got the curated roll Warden's Law and basically the same Duke with Range MW and ricochet rounds, and the WL feels way better.  It's sad.
---
Annnnnnd this is why my vault is full. 
---
fucking anthem
---
Lmao people even said fucking FOR HONOR would kill Destiny. I finally got it free on PS Plus and I‚Äôm having an absolute blast, but the two games are absolutely nothing alike haha
---
When new destiny content is out I‚Äôll be back, same as always. I‚Äôm in this bitch til the end
---
Idk what it is or where it comes from
---
I actually don't use certain exotics or mechanics because I feel it makes the game too easy, or it's just generally overpowered and it would get boring. Idk about you guys, but getting a 20+ kill streak with Rat King (or any primary pistol or a SMG), a bow, and Mechaneer's Tricksleeves while using the Way of the Trapper is a whole lot more satisfying and fun than using Luna, NF, Crimson, Chaperone, etc., and those damn spectral blades or blade barrage with the associated exotic to boost super time or regen (I only mentioned hunters cause I main one and don't feel like explaining the other two classes). If there's one exotic I'd probably use that's considered OP or cheesy, I guess it'd be Queenbreaker, but that's more so because of D1 nostalgia. I don't like how it fires quicker, seems a bit too much, but I don't have it so that's that lmao. I despise Luna despite having it, the Colony was always a piece of shit, same for Wavesplitter with the new buff trace rifles got (though I can respect the small amount of skill needed to control it, I guess). My point is, I'd rather have a battle of legitimate wits and skill, not "oh you got a lucky drop or grinded your life away on a quest, here's a free kill lolololol." The weapon I use when I'm knee deep in shit is Sturm and Drang instead of my usual load out, but I even try to hold off on that cause I've gotten countless 20+ streaks thanks to the bonus damage perk
---
Same thing with Battlefield, or Call of Duty there is always something new that‚Äôs supposed to kill the top game. 
---
Actually made me chuckle. 
---
Congrats, most of us don‚Äôt 
---
He's throwing the Nova warp subclass away.
---
Looks like a Psion
---
How is that calculated actually? I had one game where I sprayed at it the whole fight and it showed I dealt 1% damage.
---
What version of Destiny do you play that supports mods?
---
No, I‚Äôm not new. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm so fucking annoyed about it. It‚Äôs been years of this shit.
---
I should start doing that.

Carrying more than 5 motes was the first mistake

I'm not sure how it could be possible, but shotguns need a nerf in PvP.

Some things I think every player should know:
---
* Completing the main story unlocks some conveniences, such as a vehicle to zoom around on, and being able to turn in stuff to each vendor in exchange for random items. But don't feel like you need to rush if you don't want to. The #1 thing all my friends say they wish they knew is that there is nothing wrong with taking your time. A lot of mechanics are never outright stated, so it is possible to miss them if you charge through on autopilot. 
---
* You can level up really fast by doing [Heroic public events](https://www.polygon.com/destiny-2-guide-walkthrough/2017/9/7/16263480/heroic-public-events-find-trigger-earth-titan-nessus-io) if you complete a secret objective during public events. Leveling up unlocks the other two elemental subclasses. You will eventually get enough upgrade points to unlock everything, and you can swap between each subclass and subclass tree at will. 
---
* When you look at the director and hold E, it should tell you what you are supposed to do next to advance the story. 
---
* Spend some time looking around the character menu, including all the tabs at the top. There will not be any tutorial tool tips telling you to do this, so there are people who go almost the whole game not knowing the Collections tab exists. 
---
* When you encounter enemies with shields, use your secondary weapon to break the shield, and if it is the same element as the shield colour, it will do bonus damage and cause an explosion when the shield breaks. 
---
* The maximum level in the base game is 20 and the maximum light level is 300, but after 260-ish you will need to do weekly and daily challenges ("do 5 crucible matches," "do 3 strikes," things marked like that on the director) in order to reach 300. This is "the grind." 
---
* This game is around 80% pve content and 20% pvp content. 
---
* Most guides for base game content have not been updated ever, so the terminology and some information about how to progress are outdated. 
---
* The in-game chat is always very quiet, but do not confuse this for the game being dead. Most people communicate using Discord and other programs like that. To find people to play with, you can use this subreddit's discord (linked in the top right on desktop) or the /r/destinythegame discord (linked in their sidebar). There is also the official Destiny 2 app, /r/fireteams, /r/destinysherpa for raids (do not worry about this until later), or platform-specific things. 
---
Good point
---
If they wanna burn a super on a measly 3 motes then I'd call that a win for you.
---
Well thats rape
---
That's great.  That image sums up my whole Crucible career.  :)
---
Wait, why are we bitching about Hunters? They're at the bottom of the totem pole right now, in this meta anyways.
---
I enjoy my outlaw rampage kill clip with near max range, it‚Äôs not the best hand cannon but I like it and that‚Äôs more important IMO 
---
I switched off hunter for titan for skating and OEM. Have only had like 4 exotic drops and am already 648 highest ll
---
You pretty much do for that vex one with the plates. Near impossible to cover them all solo and make it heroic.
---
I‚Äôm so glad I‚Äôm not the only one. I play almost everyday yet not a single Duke has dropped. Don‚Äôt worry though, I have had enough 10 paces to walk at least a mile
---
I'm amazed with that 860 charge time you can get a shot off while being shotgun rushed honestly. 10k kills is no joke tho!
---
wow, good for you :)
---
You either die a hero or live long enough to  see yourself become the villain
---
#meisterwerk
---
Ah ok makes sense im blind
---
Rat King in Crucible seems excessively memey, but hey, you should live your own life...  along with the 5 other saps you manage to goad into this plan.
---
I feel dumb, I don‚Äôt get it...
---
Leaving an F in the chat for SynchronEyez's single death before the wish was put is preventing you guys from getting the flawless run also. Awesome job on the Petra's run man, I was super anxious of getting guitar'd when I did mine, shit is stressful.
---
exactly
---
+20? Lol amateur
---
You can only get 1 of the BrayTech weapons per day from a rare drop from sleeper nodes.
---
So it's farm to get resonate stems (which is extremely slow), then find your sleeper node (which takes more time), pray for a BrayTech schematic when opening it (which is an extremely rare drop you can only get once per day) and then its RNG if you get a dupe or not. Depending on your luck you can get stuck with 1 weapon missing technically forever if you continually get dupes.
---
Mine was also 18 Kelvins but ive seen people post about it happening with Winter Wolf and all of the other BrayTech weapons required to get Wayfarer. it sucks : (
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what I was afraid of... oh well!
---
There is one in the ramen shot too!
---
i feel your pain... this was exactly me a few weeks ago :(
---
Cata, as a whole, ruined WoW. BUT (and I loved the LK xpac) wrath definitely set the tone/precedent for things to happen in the future. We all loved the dungeon queue, no longer needing to do long ass attunement quests, raids being hard but still accessible to everyone, etc. Unfortunately that gave rise to Cata and the shithole WoW is today. 
---
I‚Äôll return to WoW classic when it‚Äôs released, and any other legacy servers up through WotLK, but I would never willingly sit through any expansions from cata onwards. I haven‚Äôt even touched the dumpster fire that is BfA, and likely never will touch the retail version of WoW for the rest of my days unfortunately. 
---
Pve is for virgins
---
I'm only doing one a day. I am only missing 18 kelvins. Got two on my first character somehow. Then on my next 2 characters I managed to get one of them.
---
Apparently, me rightfully hating on it, is making you so angry, that you are going out of your way to even comment on my post. Lol.
---
I got you. 
---
Nah just for people who are good, cant raid if you only pvp
---
....duh?
---
*laughs in gwisin vest*
---
I read several months back regarding a reliable ‚Äúleaker‚Äù leaking info about Destiny 3: taking place on the snow moon of Jupiter (forgot the name), a massive emphasis on RPG elements like being able to choose between light and darkness, some stuff like that. 
---
Have to remember: when Bungie released TTK, the main development team went to work immediately on D2, when Destiny 1 still had a solid 1.5-2 years left in its lifespan. I get the impression that Bungie knew the direction for the rest of Destiny 1 post-TTK launch, had the skeleton in place for Wrath/AoT (if not more), and hence went right to work on the next big thing, D2. Forsaken came out a year after D2 launched, just like TTK, and it seems I read about these ‚Äúleaks‚Äù not long after Forsaken released. It‚Äôs not unreasonable to assume Bungie is keeping to form in this regard. 
---
Bungie also disconnecting from Activision hints to me they are working on D3 right now. I do think Bungie wants to be rid of the stigma that follows D2 around, and from a brand/sales perspective, being able to slap a new number next to your title is probably the best way to do it, especially given the constant faceplanting mistakes that seem to follow D2 around a lost puppy. D2 is not just *their* product, it‚Äôs theirs and Activisions. Think about it:
---
‚ÄúBungie and Activision parted ways!‚Äù
---
‚ÄúSweet, wonder what Bungie will do with the Destiny franchise now that they‚Äôre finally on their own as they‚Äôve wanted to be?‚Äù
---
‚Äú....they‚Äôre gonna keep making Destiny 2 content....‚Äù
---
^^^I can‚Äôt see that happening. 
---
Funny thing is i got mine on exactly my 20th run
---
Hahaha to quote him "Oh, I'm dead. Eh, doesn't matter."  I gotta admit, I'm just glad its done. We were super anxious too. We spent a good five minutes checking every corner in Vault.
---
if IF the flashpoint is on IO then i can get wayfarer! 
---
Same
---
I'd hate me too
---
Yessss!
---
This...this is why I hate titans...the reason I finally broke and made A titan was soley for that sweet one hit melee which enrages me ever more than that super shield
---
I kinda hate dtg, it's just all people whining and bitching. Reading the posts there is just depressing and idk if anyone who reads there even actually likes the game going by how they talk about it.
---
It looks like he's in timeout in the pic, maybe it's just a coincidence lol
---
10th run here.
---
Lol I was thinking about doing that today just because I keep running out of Vault space
---
One of us, one of us
---
Great art. This is now my lock screen.
---
TTK is to D1 what Forsaken is to D2. Following that model (no reason to believe otherwise), we can reasonably expect to see a Wrath of the Machine-esque xpac this fall. 
---
Me: *Takes our hunter detector*

Hunter Detector: *Beep*

What every fallen was saying when the iron lords retook the wall
---
I can‚Äôt hear you over 40% celestial nighthawk damage increase and let‚Äôs be honest a PvE buff is far more valuable than a PvP buff
---
That‚Äôs spicy, I still need to do that since I just finished my collections card 
---
Amen brotha, amen
---
Na, i just recently started playing again, the prime engrams track how often you're getting them and my data shows an absence from October til yesterday. Only makes sense that they're popping up more often for me. 
---
oh god, please no. 
---
I swear I once saw a guy with 654,321 kills on sentinel. Could have been 123,456 though as it was pretty early in year one, in trials. 
---
How do you efficiently use the pauldrons? I feel like I'm wasting them every super cast.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs sad how dilapidated the facility has gotten, the tank is vandalized and unsealed so now it‚Äôs a spooky green

Dude, get ready for them downvotes...

Four ways

1. Quests/Campaign rewards

3. Xur (Y1 only)

4. Sell your soul to Satan

Son what are you smoking? Take a look. I see quite a few nightstalkers in the top 10 on PC. Then do a Global search across ALL platforms, Hunters still rule. So stop yer crying will ya?

Also doing the Leviathan raid and opening the chests in the underbelly, but that can only give you year 1 exotics.

---
Thats me with any exotic. I have half of my exotics in the vault.

why do I love this so much

Wait. I think i don't get it?

I assume because of Anthem, right? Pls no r/woooosh

But I want Shin-chan's Last Word.  ;-;

I think that shards needed to be nerfed more than BB.  BB didn‚Äôt actually need a nerf except for self damage.

Did we just become best friends?

Not D2, but LDR 5001 was great. Long Distance Relationship. It‚Äôs fitting for a sniper

Are you an auto rifle junkie as well fellow punch machine?

Lmao. Funniest thing i‚Äòve seen in a while.
---
That is impressively bad. 
---
F
---
The numbers prove it man, the are double as many hunters as everyone else, everybody is using OEM titan right now, im not complaining just to complain and say nerf titans nerf hunters. I just want warlocks to actually stand a chance man, because right now, not a single one of our supers can be considered great. Fists of havoc, hammers, specral blades, and Blade barrage can all be considered great supers without a doubt. Us warlocks, we have bottom tree dawnblade, which is alright when the blades actually deal damage or actually seek like they're supposed to, and nova bomb, which youre lucky if you can get more than one kill with. I just dont understand why warlocks dont have anything man. 
---
Anyway to farm the frequencies for sleeper?
---
I was for basically all of my Destiny career until I found Chattering Bone, so now I'm a pulse fan. Auto rifles are still definitely my second choice though.
---
Best weapon is still a big ol' Fist of Havoc from 50 feet up, of course. ‚ù§
---
Got 2 my first run... üòÖ
---
Imagine playing a shit mode like crucible
---
Yes, I think we did. Wanna hop on Discord tomorrow? :D
---
Pathetic, I got two on my first try
---
But I like pvp and think it could be better?
---
It literally does nothing on non-sword weapons. Weapon damage is assigned by fire rate and weapon class - two 110 hand cannons with different impact stats will do the same damage as each other. It's mostly an indicator of a general idea of the per-shot weapon damage.
---
On swords, it makes it deal more damage.
---
I dont get it
---
More than 50% were made in comp :) 
---
Hmm ok I guess I could try that
---
Knowing how to precharge is the key. But once you know how to do it fusionrifles are better than any shotgun in the game. 
---
iv never really had a huge problem with it but then again i dont play PvP that much
---
I need it io as well!
---
I dunno man
---
I ask myself the same question about mobile players 
---
You dont even need some of the wanted bounties to even complete it. Look up there locations on google it helped me find all of the wanted I didn't have!
---
I have been farming prometheus lens catalysts for 3 days now. But got nothing.
---
Ghost: I dunno, probably some space magic, ask a damn warlock or something.
---
What gun is that?
---
I literally thought exodus crash was the only strike when i started playing, got it 4 times in a row before a new one showed up. I was shocked
---
Nothing kills a guardian faster than another guardian...or a random wall.
---
Thank you
---
So what if I wiped 30 times on the tree parkour before the ogre boss, it was my first time and I DESERVED IT.
---
Representing that voop nation well
---
If I remember correctly, DTG was a cess pit of toxicity at release of Destiny 2. Like so far flung with anger and rude behaviour that this subreddit was made as refuge for more positive community surroundings regardless of the outcome of release.
---
Well done titanbro
---
hard disagree
---
Yeah I can understand raids a little more despite the fact it's still scummy and taking advantage of people who dont have 5 friends to surfer through with.
---
r/destinymemes then. most of this sub is filled with low effort nonsense (and unlike in r/dtg, its actually allowed here). also not all of r/dtg is bungie suggestions (which you can filter out) anyway
---
Quite simply yes the gun is worth it. It's one of three guns I run in the raid as a primary ( with midnight coup or inaugural address -which I know is an energy weapon but I it uses kinetic ammo so I would pair it with threat level). It has the same feel as origin story but the unique perf of increased RoF when rampage stacks means it can tear through red bar adds for fun. 
---
Heart of inmost you should be able to get it from xur if u choose the right caracter to pick up the engram with
---
Took me about 17 hours within 2 days of grinding to get a feeding frenzy and kill clip, that fucking eyeball was dropping me shit rolls after the next, and even got a rangefinder with hip-fire grip one. Also, you can skip the passing train part if you're fast and for the miniboss, either use your super or heavy, but not both unless it's a super you can regenerate fast like nova bomb, blade barrage, or shadowshot.
---
I actually hate your luck if thats possible
---
There‚Äôs so many better choices out there though. Just use a coup. 110s aren‚Äôt my cup of tea. All preference.
---
At the end of a random game after crucible or after hitting a rank?
---
It's a forsaken exotic... So I don't think I can.
---
what was the point of this?? just ignore him dude
---
Lol Same thing happened to me. But I despise the gun so I won‚Äôt get myself to join that dark side.
---
That must of been one hell of a raid
---
Guys... I have a confession to make. I simply cannot use a shotgun in PVP. I simply cannot aim the thing. I do OK with hand cannons and pulse rifles, but shotguns... I don't think I've ever made a shot connect. All I want for Christmas is to be a shotgun ape :( 
---
And I think the bigger problem are the catalysts. I've had at least 7 crucible resets since forsaken dropped and the only crucible catalyst I have is jade rabbit.
---
Nah, was two different clears
---
Imaginable. I can't disagree that my RNG in terms of exotics has been good. I find it kind of unfair that there's so much discrepancy between players' RNG.
---
It boggles my mind that people still don‚Äôt know how to play gambit. 15 gamers smh.
---
Sorry i play destiny 2 in french easy to confuse things XD
---
Haha no problems buddy. Good luck hunting those exotics
---
Okay, thanks!
---
Hmm, Ill go for it then, thanks!
---
Except when you play all 3 and don‚Äôt give a shit.
---
I think they are gonna tweek catalysts drops with season of the drifter
---
Have you tried not swearing?
---
If you do one a day, I say around a day or thirty.. 
---
Go for it, guardian. Put a minor spec mod on it and that thing shines brighter than the sun :)) Happy hunting!
---
It's worth going for the dregden title too. Takes your mind off the grind 
---
I still like it, but it still has problems is all I was saying, people are downvotey jerks with anything they don't agree with tho.
---
You gotta rethink your adjectives my man. 
---
I hadn't noticed any issue - surrounded definitely used to proc on it although I hadn't paid any attention to the damage numbers. I only used it directly after it dropped so that was several weeks ago - was the bug introduced after more recent update? Perhaps I hadn't noticed as the sword was hitting like a truck with or without surrounded &amp; surrounded spec bonus damage
---
Completing weekly quests and Nightfalls
---
Badass! 
---
Shards dropped from crucible.don't remember how oem dropped
---
Well, I googled it, and it turns out you actually can. So I guess I should just buy the normal version for now, and maybe get the pass later this year, depending on what they will announce for the autumn.
---
Thanks!  I love my Titan,. My girlfriend is a hunter main she doesn't have much space up there other than a cayde plush.   And sadly I giant fortnite llama pickaxe we haven't hung up yet.  Haha. 
---
isnt the reload speed of curated WL really bad? I've had 3 of them (kept 1 for collections sake). 
---
On the other hand the feeding frenzy &amp; rampage version sounds much better imo
---
Oh, RIP. Well I hope you find a group. Once you get a couple of completions under your belt it gets much easier to find groups.
---
Yeah I have a general idea what to do I've watch a couple videos on the encounters for the last wish raid just never done it 100 percent but yeah me too thanks fam.
---
/I don't like this/
---
The architects - More kills than the black death. More kills than smallpox. More kills than the entire guardian force combined. Mortality rate of 100 percent, everyone has caught and died with this. Absolutely destructive.
---
Wings of sacred dawn, HA GAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY. Would have been better off getting handed a literal pile of shit.
---
I only just recently started playing competitive (after the OEM confidence boost), and a Titan using Chaperone cut me down to size. 
---
No problem! One I thought of the whole ratio thing I had to start testing it.
---
As a Warlock, I wholeheartedly support this.
---
I got both of mine  first try
---
I am getting some trials vibes. 
---
A moment with the godly looking ldr 5000?
---
Dude, this is freakin amazing! 
---
Should have "Void Kill Ultimate perk" (get more xp, glimmer, tokens, telemetry, ... Only with void kills) and "Void Kill Tracker"
---
I didn't even know this post existed lol my bad
---
But then when you invade and keep them off the primeval just long enough to win, feelsgoodman.
---
Gambit is a cruel mistress 
---
I found a good review of the armoury. Basically, it adds a waves mode with access to exclusive guns and a new raid. And it sounds a bit dull. I will see what exactly will the next one offer, and maybe get it later.
---
This is the genie we need. It actually looks really good.

As a warlock, if I had to complain about something, it's that I wish I could somehow make assault rifles and other weapons a bit more reliable in the air as a Top-tree Dawnblade. I was so disappointed in the Air Assault perk. :(
---
And most of the Warlock robes look too feminine on a male character. Seriously it looks like my character is wearing a dress. Bring back trench coat Warlock robes!
---
Get that exotic warlock chest piece, or get the curated nation of beasts roll.  Or forge a Kindled Orchid and get lucky.
---
That‚Äôs the most untrue statement that‚Äôs ever existed 
---
All I need is one to bring cayde back
---
I look at the 2 main perks... if they are good, i'll keep it.  The secondary perks I don't really worry about.  My Duke with Outlaw and Rampage is pretty good.  Breaking it down based on the other perks is just getting way to nit-picky.
---
114/116 here, missing the raid ones still.
---
OEM dropped from a random cruscible daily and galanors dropped from a trash mob right when i started blind well for a friend lol
---
Just make it back to the way it used to be in D1. 
---
They aren't.
---
You just get a perk on your clan banner that boosts the chances if you run crucible (and strikes) with clan mates.
---
I think my favorite worst roll ever was a sigh let‚Äôs word with tap the trigger and full auto trigger
---
He right.
---
Also spectral blades need s nerf and thunder crash needs a buff 
---
Sorry
---
Many thanks! 
---
Breakneck hasn't left my inventory since I got it. The best/most fun way to mow down trash mobs. Before you proc Onslaught it's pretty meh but once that rate of fire ramps up you just obliterate everything. Totally worth the grind! 
---

Very nice. I heard about the Aladdin live action movie, but to be honest, it‚Äôs not the one I‚Äôm worried about.
---
No
---
I was pumped when mine dropped but after using them awhile and the inconsistency of return I went back to rigs, just love throwing down tether and going invisible when in trouble. 
---
&gt;Probably misunderstanding. I go on here to find destiny highlights or news etc. 
---
And therein lied the problem. 
---
If you want serious discussion, that Bungie often involves themselves in, you need to go to /r/DestinyTheGame. 
---
Yah basically that‚Äôs it
---
I just compared it to the actual V-Wing model. I don't think that they actually pulled it straight from game files, but it definitely looks plagiarized.
---
This sub is better tho bc it has a mix. Like that thanks meme. It‚Äôs perfectly balanced.
---
Full choke. Accurized, slideshot adn full auto but has handling masterwork

Ohhhh man. I hadn‚Äôt even noticed that part until you pointed it out. Hopefully he‚Äôs got insurance...

This isn't an LFG sub.

Why have strong abilities when you can have   C  A  P  E  ?
---
Actually the Lost Sector on Earth is way faster. It is at Firebase Hades, Pathfinder Crash lost sector. It should take around a minute to go in and out. Is way faster than Mars one 
---
I just got the Breakneck a few days ago (finally), but I‚Äôm not really impressed. It seems like too low of an impact to really hit hard, and the Onslaught perk makes it really unstable to where I can only fire in bursts. I even put the Rampage mod on it, but I‚Äôm still partial to Bygones. Is there something I‚Äôm missing with the Breakneck?
---
Points at Telesto, and then 1000 Voices..
---
Damnit now my hopes just went down a good percentage. Good luck to you mate, eventually you would get a good good one 
---
You bow have 0 wishes. Bye
---
I think [this might be the link](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/9rjfwf/nightfall_specific_loot_farming_having_a_highest/) you're looking for. It lists all the "par" scores and explains why 200k is the magic number.
---
This was me yesterday. Pretty sure I over shot and slid like 5 times. 
---
Riskrunner sure is fun to use in the Fallen forges (Gofannon and Bergusia). Not sure if that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs listed here, but it‚Äôs the reason I pulled one out of the vault.
---
You right, but there is nothing else I can do right now. Other than leveling up my titan and no ty I would pass on that one for now.
---
Thanks man, appreciate it - I‚Äôm just learning atm.
---
All data is provided by warmind.io but from my personal experience I would say its really well used in Last Wish since almost all Taken bois inflict Arc damage. I‚Äôm using it personally situationally as well :-)
---
Wanted enemies from Prison of Elders in Strikes. 
---
Wut really wow you lucky mate! Thanks eventually I would get one
---
It looks like nezarecs sin. Nice
---
Also great for Fallen public events anywhere in the solar system.
---
Yep, I scrub and Shaxx kept that 1 point lol
---
Energy cross bow that shoots multiple bolts that tether together and will chain damage the more u tether 
---
That would make the entire pass for this season completely worthless for me. I hope not. I hope that the next couple of DLC's will have something, if not the next then the final DLC in the past which is supposed to be the biggest.
---
This unironically looks infinitely better, like polish it up a bit and I woulda been happy with the genie looking like this. 
---
Ive been using Riskrunner in Bergusia. By the time the other 2 guardians realize whats going on Im standing on a pile of 10+ batteries that need to be thrown :P
---
Must be an old video from when the dawning was active.
---
That's 4 wishes pal

Nah, he said "and" which counts as a separate wish,  No Land Beyond was their last wish.

Ah, gotcha! :)
---
Fuck. I failed my genie job

I love this. I'm wondering, though, since Sagira has those floaty bits on the sides, are the struts necessary?
---
Does checking ammo bricks have something to do with infamous guitar boss?
---
Wow that looks cool but I think you should make the eye bigger( the glowing thing)üôÉ
---
It still is.
---
Then why is Tony holding the gun??
---
One more week and you can jump in!
---
Can you explain how this is 4 wishes
---
Jared! Or, Jill. James? Something with a J!
---
If you haven't run BW yet, you'll probably find that this is answered for you the first time you jump in (not giving you shit, just saying that people are usually ready to go there). There's always someone ready to start it up, and you'll usually find someone on their way back to the well to start up the Heroic event before you even realize it. 
---
You aren‚Äôt chained to running raiden flux for everything and you can do things like dragon shadow top tree and still put out good damage with the super.
---
Thanks! I don't have Breakneck or either of the trench barrel shotguns though, so I have to keep myself happy somehow ;)
---
The issue with healing rift is the time it takes to cast. Unless you can drop it prior to the actual encounter, it's most likely ending in a death. That said, I don't see an issue with this due to the usefulness in PvE. 
---
You stated;
---
&gt; I think they are gonna tweek catalysts drops
---
and that's false. Drop chances will still be the exact same. The only difference is that there will be a clan banner perk available to boost the chance for strikes/crucible.
---
That doesn't mean anything for people without the banner, people who play alone, or people who play when their clan isn't available; because the chance stays exactly the same.
---
Rookie mistake. Wish for more genies so that way we don't have to waste one wishing for more friends 
---
Ikelos Shotgun
---
Just as good in Gofannon, works ok in the first forge as 1/2 the guys there shoot Arc
---
What Sparrow is that?! It looks v cool! 
---
The only good looking warlock helmets are exotics and dawning ones.
---
r/unexpectedwarframe
---
I use it when I‚Äôm doing escalation protocol, let a thrawl hit you once and it‚Äôs over! That‚Äôs how I did the catalyst for the riskrunner 
---
Are you using a elite controller and running the jumper layout by chance
---
We will keep fighting 
---
Is it the damage resistance. Because thats not going anywhere unless they give it something else to help with closing the gap. Like a 200 or 300% run boost. Or warp abilities. 
---
Rule 8.
---
MUCH MUCH BETTER
---
When it comes to crucible duration matters more than damage especially since all roaming supers can one shot regardless 
---
SSTTTAAAHHHHPP. YOUR GIVING EVERVERSE IDEAS
---
How much do I owe you?
---
It's some prett rough latency. It sucks since you can't do anything about it. No fps I know of ever properly considers someone's connection when matchmaking.
---
Is it, though? For arc damage intake, sure. I think I would argue Breakneck or Huckleberry for general crowd control, though.
---
This this this this this. Omg this
---
Send me a friend request so I can remove you from my friends list...

What‚Äôs the cloak in your hunter?
---
Hunter looks bad ass! 
---
That would look really nice with a projection 
---
Memory of Cayde Cloak
---
also the invisibility, which despite not making it impossible to see them, its still harder, it also hides them from the map and makes them quieter, yes the damage resistance is annoying, and even without gwisin it still lasts a while. and it rivals pre-nerf nova warps ability to kill supers quickly, although not in one shot and nova warp obviously cant do anything anymore
---
This ghost ran the Kessel run in 12 parsecs
---
Idk why people say anthem compete more with warframe. Both anthem and destiny have a small set of playable classes (3 classes in destiny, 4 javelins in anthem) and loot dropping from enemies. They both seem to have a story and longer missions that are more rewarding (strikes in destiny, strongholds in anthem)
---
They're pretty similar at the core but anthem has a much more active gameplay with flying around and multiple levels to get increased loot. 
---
Everyone might not agree but this is what immediately popped into my head when I read the post. 
---
1) Add Hawkmoon. 
---
2) Make Sparrow Racing a permanent thing along with exclusive SR armor and shit. 
---
3) For the love of God, bring back Cayde-6. 
---
I promise I‚Äôll come up with a better three wishesüòÇ

Cayde-6 will remove your ace of spades though

Yep

Falling flashbacks intensified
---
Ada-1 sells different frames each week. Until now, *every* weapon frame was only gone for a max of 2 weeks. The sniper frame not being available this week is a first. There is no way to get BA frames when Ada-1 isn't selling them, aside from the free ones you get from the forge unlock quests. 
---
Dragonfly spec would like a word with you
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs the one I‚Äôm talking about. It‚Äôs just vanished. Like, the one I have to collect all the cores and crap for. 
---
Start from scratch. We need new classes. Scavenger, Wizard and Colossus should work 
---
This is why I only ever tried this once.  I hate jumping "puzzles" in general, and the floaty feel of jumping in Destiny 2 just guarantees I skip that kind of content.
---
Hunter mobility is the strongest in the game for shotgunning, which is the strongest strat at the moment. It‚Äôs less about abilities and more about neutral game. 
---
Personally I think they‚Äôre a littttle bit stronger than warlocks in the crucible rn but weaker than titans, not OP by any stretch.
---
Counterpoint taken. However, it is more situational, wouldn't you agree? Huck reloads on kills and stacks rampage without the necessity of another proc'd perk.
---
Shit. 
---
I‚Äôve been since the original. I know the danger haha my crushing student loan debt is the only thing that keeps my head on straight so I actually study 
---
At least they gave me a nice long fall to think about how much I suck at platforming in first-person.
---
Ahhh I knew you was gonna bring up invisibility up.
---
Heres a news flash. If the invisibilty is so good WHY WAS IT PRE BUFF THE WORSE SUPER IN THE GAME.
---
The invis is worthless it just makes it so you need to be aware of your surroundings and force you to play slowly. If thats the tipping point then oh boy you must really thing captain America is the most godly op super in the game.
---
Nice easy prestige raid lairs.
---
Every enemy type does arc damage. And I play stormcaller. So I toss a grenade at an enemy, it blows up, I get the perk. I have never, in all of my playing D2 since I got Riskrunner, not had the conduction when I decided to use it in a room.
---
HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT X GUN
---
IT POOPS FIRE
---
SOMETHING SOMETHING EDGY CAPS LOCK THAT AN 80'S WRESTLER WOULD WRITE
---
Killed by the architects. 
---
According to patch notes, the bug causing the stuff you get from enemies to not drop has been fixed, but there is not a retroactive fix for people whose frames disappeared. When Ada-1 sells it again, you will be able to complete it as normal. 
---
HOW dare you call yourself a TITAN when you clearly killed 5 enemies with a weapon/ability. Truly outrageous. You might be a titan but we do not grant you the title of a true TITAN! 
---
Oof jesus i wouldnt be able to keep up lmao. I was barely able to handle the Knights that would try wiping us.
---
Verity‚Äôs Brow on pulse nades with Riskrunner is great in gambit
---
Solo forge completions were posted in yt a couple days after black armory dlc dropped
---
So Zavala and Genie had a baby and his name is Dr. Manhattan
---
Saw the video before I saw the title and literally thought, ‚Äòheh heh, reminds me of the first ascendant challenge I did‚Äô LOL
---
Ah that sucks. How do I finish my Gofannon unlock then? I thought she only sold the powerful frames or whatever?
---
I think it‚Äôs time to go to back to Precursor chrome 
---
Base game items, I think you did the daily heroic missions from bounties she gave you
---
This just made me laugh so ugly 
---
damn titan skaters
---
I'd definitely like to know the gear here. looks dope af.
---
For all of them? 
---
Can you do one for pvp?
---
Would love to see what the meta is for PvP havent played in awhile. 
---
So is there any way to get that gear armor for the class ever again?
---
I use a Zen moment / rampage Go Figure in PvE, and a outlaw / kill clip Right Side in PVP. I prefer the Go Figure.
---
Warlock armor is a little harder to identify, all I can tell is nezarics sin
---
Please tell me crimson days triumphs are double dipping for doubles

---
Year one base armor, unfortunately you cant get them anymore. 
---
Oh lawd he comin
---
I think I have, but I can't remember what it said. I definitely will look at it again though. Easily my favorite Exotic ever since I picked it up. üíô
---
Did you took the offering to the Oracle last week? 2/7 or week 24? I only took them until the last message but I'm super curious to know what happened last week. Did anyone did it? Can't find it on YouTube. Was there no dialogue any more?
---
Also if the enemy are dealing arc damage (to proc conductor) try pairing risk runner with a devour warlock. The full health on kill is freaking awesome
---
Give me more solo dungeons. Whisper and Shattered Throne are the two best parts of Destiny. 
---
Yes homo
---
yeah that one lol. Is it? I'll have to do some research then as I rarely get time for group stuff. Thanks =D
---
Glass II: Destiny Engine 
---
Either way, you still have a sweet hand cannon
---
You can go to the Gofannon forge without having a frame at this point, I believe. The frame wasn't required for unlocking, it was a free item akin to a quest reward. 
---
&gt;I thought she only sold the powerful frames or whatever?
---
Ada-1 sells three different powerful frames per week. You can buy up to 2. Once you buy a powerful frame, you can buy non-powerful copies of that frame to farm. 
---
I had a phalanx shield blast me right through the portal in Gambit, where I got taken out immediately.
---
Gotcha. Thanks a bunch, mate. 
---
Is that sparrow still obtainable?
---
Facts
---
Damn, I really want that cloak
---
Triple jump Hunter, jump once, twice then wait til you're just below the platform you want to land on, and soft jump POP right up onto the platform. 
---
What do you expect? It's a super simple game with no depth. It's pretty much candy crush with guns. Why on Earth would someone feel the need to research a mechanic essential to gameplay? Do you have any idea how hard it would be to find a ten minute video of someone explaining something about Destiny on the internet? You live in a dreamworld friend.

Nightstalkers are why Mayhem Sucks, like you can't use your super for more than a split second cause the moment you activate your super a Nightstalker will just knock you out of it.
---
As of right now, no

Until it gets reimplemented treat it as previous season eververse armor
---
Lmao just found out the only new emote is in a silver bundle. 
---
I like how your TL;DR was still pretty long. Thanks for your research though OP!
---
But man, titans suck. 
---
More importantly, you're using the wrong perk on the Suros.
---
Right after mods sticky a post about lfgs smh
---
Might be people salty about getting destroyed with a Blade Barrage and forgetting that the Blade Barrage usually only kills a *single target* when shit like Nova Warp, Dawnblade and every singe Titan super can kill a whole team instead. Getting hit with Blade Barrage is usually more of a feelsbad than anything of particular consequence.
---
I'd liken Blade Barrage to Chaos Reach or Nova Bomb in that regard; great to kill one person but you're only going to get one person unless the entire enemy team is basically on top of eachother. Though Nova Bomb has the benefit of leaving a giant black hole to do residual damage for a while or a bunch of homing projectiles (basically a bigger grenade, in either case) and Chaos Reach is an electro-laser that lasts for a little while. Blade Barrage really is one-and-done.
---
(Saying all of this as a Warlock main)
---
What have you brought into this cursed land
---
Why is sleeper on the list? It sucks at dps. Enhoar made a video comparing Acrius to other power weapons and found sleeper doing only 7k dps at Greg.
---
Sure, I'll do one tommorow! 
---
Sure, I'll do one tommorow!
---
In that case they are just that random drops.  You have a better chance if you are running a fireteam medallion (not real sure this actually works, but I do seem to get more when using then when not).  You also have a better chance with more powerful enemies, raid chests, and powerful/prime engram drops.

Nice
---
Missed opportunity to entitle your post "Thornament" and receive hundreds of up-motes. 
---
Rip well okay thanks for clearing this up
---
When does the reset happen?
---
Do the heroic adventure on tangled shore when it's available. The barons at the end of the adventure drop the gear. So do it today, and keep your eyes on when a heroic adventure can be done again. Every two days or so, I believe
---
For Hunter, it's literally only Forsaken exotics.
---
&gt;  Is it? 
---
Yup, I did it myself solo last time Shattered Throne was up. 
---
Come on man, this is basic genieology
---
I've played a fair bit of gambit (approaching 11th infamy reset). Rarely do I meet folks who can kill mobs and bank motes as quickly as my striker titan skullfort build but a few months back i played with a hunter who beat me first kills &amp; motes every time. He was using a god roll smg  (can't remember which).
---
About time I started using the pillager I have with outlaw, rampage and rampage spec mod. I'll give it a go tonight. From memory when I briefly tested it before it was so stable it was a laser beam and proc'ing outlaw was easy
---
honestly just chill in the well and make sure kill as many servants as possible
---
PSA: The "Most Loyal" lore pages can drop from the Tangled Shore whenever it is flashpoint. You can get them from lost sectors, public events (not sure if only heroic, or if heroic just has a higher drop chance) and replaying heroic adventures. 
---
You are also guaranteed one legendary item drop the first time you complete a heroic adventure on the Tangled Shore each day. [Source](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/Update/47249) They are now the sole source of the "Spoils of the Shore" armor pieces. 
---
It's still one of the most used weapons tho, people often use it for its usage anywhere in the game ie. Raids, Gambit etc.
---
If you have Acrius or tractor cannon can you kill spectral blades before he kills you? I think it's 50/50
---
Immunity phases for primeval bosses?  No, no. Its annoying as hell in strikes, I would defintely stop playing gambit if the bosses had immunity phases
---
Nice, congratz!
---
Cool beans, I'll get to finding a good video guide then in prep.
---
Watch me.
---
I saw that too.
---
Did Bungie update the Nightfall yet, look like they may be doing it by hand now
---
Gambit I can understand since it has the range and lethality against guardians. But why use it in raids if there are a ton of other weapons that do higher dps? Imo the only places where sleeper is worth using is Gambit and izanami forge.
---
Tractor for sure, just fire to suppress and if they're not already dead run in and take them out
---
Triangles
---
You can do as many heroic adventures in one day on the flashpoint planet, but it only gives you powerful gear when it's the "daily challenge." The heroic adventure on the Tangled Shore is guaranteed to give you one legendary item the first time you do it each day, which *might* be the Spoils of the Shore armor, but you can keep farming. [Source](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/Update/47249)
---
Don't ask me dawg, this is meta provided by warmind.io app, it's not my personal preference since I never used sleeper and I don't even have it in my account yet, lol &gt;:(

News flash! It will NEVER .. EVER be balanced... ever. I'd say just take supers and class abilities out of PVP all together to get the whaaaaambulance to stop showing up every 5 butt hurts.  This discussion is getting older than the "Look what I Did/Got" posts. 
---
Can you still get it? I started playing 2 months ago 
---
Shaders?
---
Blood Cleaver, finally. Been waiting to complete that triumph since October/November.
---
It is fixed, I have heard if you restart the game after getting all the eggs, you will get the sparrow.
---
Or at least, the sparrow will be in your collection? I'm not sure, when people say the bug was fixed when they restarted the game, they are not clear about whether they got the sparrow or only unlocked it in collections. 
---
Yes, you can.
---
True. It's only a guaranteed drop the first time you do it. I didn't clarify or even say that, but yes, ur right. The baron gear is not powerful though. 
---
What is the date drop for Season of the Drifter?
---
Not quite the same thing. 
---
I googled it and on a database it says season 2 bright engram. Can you get it from the new bright engram?
---
Learned something new!
---
Sorry, when you said "keep your eyes on when a heroic adventure can be done again. Every two days or so" I thought you were saying people could only do one heroic adventure every two days! 
---
But use rampage spec mod over minor spec. 
---
Or when you here titan hammers pop....
---
Pretty sure you have to do all the triumphs, don't @ me tho
---
I've run the Raid just as much as you and still don't have it.  Stop crying and get back to it.
---
This is rediculous. We have had Pyramidion and will of the thousands SO MANY TIMES. Gets so frustrating waiting week after week for Hollowed Lair. 
---
Sword and Auto rifle were just this following week. Are you kidding me??!
---
You can get them from Mercury activities, I think. They came from the Osiris campaign. That's how I got mine anyway
---
Yeah, that's my bad. Words are hard. I believe we meant the same thing, just said differently.
---
My go to loadout for PvE now is Izanagi's Burden and curated Nation of Beasts. I've been using Breakneck/Go Figure and IKELOS shotgun for far too long. 
---
All these "concerns" people have and I am just over here planning to wait until reviews are in to decide one way or the other.  Speculation is pointless, wait and see what the game is, or is not, like 3+ months after release.
---
I haven't bought a game within the first month of release in years.  Hell, I got Destiny 2 for free (and all expansions up through Forsaken for $30).  The games are cheaper, and most of the *growing pains* are over.
---
You getthe sparrow, you dont have to pull it.  He mostly likely didn't click the triumph and go to orbit yet.
---
Lmao I got 2 and I only ran the raid 18 times
---
Have you tried using an emblem that doesn't have any tracker? It may sound dumb but last weekend some clanmates and I were only able to finish last wish by doing this.
---
Ah thanks, I just found it in my collection, that‚Äôs good enough for me. Gonna try it out later 
---
Not to mention that invading immediately after the other team summons their primeval is a horrible time to invade.
---
I think 50/50 because tractor cannon is a shotgun so you need to get in close range to use it and the spectral blade super kills you by getting in close range so it's kinda like a shotgun vs shotgun fight where you click but your opponent clocked a microsecond faster than you and kills you.
---
This is only the 4th (I think?) time since Forsaken released that we've had Will of the Thousands. 
---
WHAT IS WRONG WITH HUNTERS?
---
Pew pew stuff, do weekly/daily things.  You'll raise your light and be badass in no time
---
You have no idea how many times I have to yell "ENVOYS FIRST" in text chat while the team is desperately trying to damage the primevil as soon as it spawns in. Now I just use my Borealis to match shield type and kill envoys myself while teammates are like "Wow, we must be magic, we're melting right through him now!"
---
feels like its been there for quite some time, at min its been there 1/2 a month
---
i just nut
---
1. I wish my feet would elevate over  4inch terrain and would not hold me back like a 6 foot wall and require a jump. 
---
2. I wish my first jump on my hunter wouldn't use up a second jump just because I tried to jump close to the end of a ledge.
---
3. I wish Cayde-6 was still alive.
---
Looks so beastly 
---
Complete all triumphs for CD I think I saw in the TWAB to get the ghost shell
---
Check collections, sometimes you the game doesn't give it to you, but it shows that you have it in collections and you can claim it there.
---
I thought blast furnace was a 5 burst?
---
Awesome thanks for that! I'll take a look
---
Chamber of Starlight. It's the really long one with the gauntlet style encounter.
---
i've never had one, hopefully i'll get one sooner or later 
---
I have the same roll on my Duke with a maxed stability masterwork. It's so damn good
---
Just farm Blast Furnace from Ada this week, it's very similar with slightly better base stats in most areas (unless you don't have the annual pass, then ignore me).
---
Haha.
---
At the core it's still same ol' destiny.
---
You‚Äôre right, I missed it before üòÅ
---
Thanks man
---
how big is the crimson days update?
---
u/titletoimagebot
---
All granted, but as a result of cayde coming back you forfeit your ace of spades
---
Awesome thanks! 
---
True Destiny is Destiny.  If you look at it as a whole there is a lot of stuff to do.  You can grind for rolls, collect lore, play stories, PvP, the list goes on.  There are so many post of people announcing their return and asking what they should.  The answer is just play the game, and I also highly recommend find an LFG that you like.  I use Discord PC LFG that way I can find people to talk to and do things with.
---
&gt;  curated Nation of Beast
---
I'm hunting this every single week, yet don't have any... Hope I'll get one this week... &gt;:(
---
You have to complete all the Crimson Days triumphs
---
Toland's quote on the bounty gives you a hint where it is, and the weekly reset infographic stickied to this subreddit says where. 
---
Just to warn you, this is one of the longer, more difficult ones! It's the one where you run through a lot of crap to get to the boss, while being chased by knights. 
---
Where did you get this very helpful photo breakdown? 
---
i need new player [https://www.bungie.net/en/Profile/ReferAFriend?code=RAF-K94-Y7C-K7X](https://www.bungie.net/en/Profile/ReferAFriend?code=RAF-K94-Y7C-K7X)
---
Inaugural address?
---
&gt; how on earth people still trust them after all this time is beyond me.
---
Why does anyone need to "trust" them.  I just wait until the game has been out a few months and I know exactly what I am getting into *if* I decide to buy it.  Trust isn't necessary.
---
People actually use Arsenic?
---
Heavy ammo finder doesnt stack, only one will actually work
---
Don't know, equipped it today for the first time for the breakneck quest
---
This is not a LFG subreddit. Use one of the many available options to LFG. 
---
Ok... That doesn't answer my question though. All the Forsaken exotics are missing or like 2 specific ones? 
---
I got it on my first run, and again on my 8th. I also got a glittering key with it
---
Riskrunner is meta, has been meta, and will always be, meta. I love the shit out of that gun. It never leaves my energy slot unless I need DPS.
---
I literally just run and fly away as fast and high as possible, they run out of super, then they shotgun me like the filthy apes they are and my effort was completely wasted.
---
This is current PvE meta according to warmind.io, Jotunn is widely used in PvP though.
---
No problem. People in this sub get mad when I say this but when you see their reasoning for thinking that certain things are overpowered it‚Äôs honestly hilarious how bad their reasoning is. I swear most people on this sub don‚Äôt know what a radar is. 
---
Thanks for the info on that. Had no idea
---
No, that's a problem between PC and your chair, right in the middle of them :D
---
Where's your Perfect Paradox?!?!
---
I only saw it once
---
I started Wayfarer grind last week, and I only have Io and EDZ heroics left
---
 
---
I'm so stupid gotta wait 1.5 months for my Wayfarer fuck
---
You can still shoot it even when it falls down, you just need to find it down there.
---
I can finally get Blast Furnace??? :O
---
why wouldnt you put perfect paradox on
---
Has there been double or triple infamy at all this season?
---
Might be a good idea to say what country you're in mate. I know you say you get on at different times, but there'll be one time you're on more than others.
---
Banking motes happen at random
---
SMOKEY!
---
Screeb + Tether cheiftan
---
Downvoting because a classic would be generic shell, that keychain looks really cool tho
---
9 am PDT, I think. Then 10 am after daylight savings ends.
---
It‚Äôs not bad actually the little bit of health you get back from casting your barrier is clutch sometimes 
---
Bro that barrel perspective üòî 
---
Bottom row all the way on the right. 
---
At least now I know where my keys are. 
---
Where exactly can i do this then, if nowhere else?
---
I mean i saw many other posts about this topic here. 
---
Ah so lucky did strange terrain 40 times last week with everyone Else on my team getting the stupid rocket launcher except me even tried my other characters and it was still a no go üò§
---
Literally thankyou, breytech winter wolf is the last god damn thing I needed for Wayfarer
---
Deleted
---
Yeah good luck on that one bud
---
And hunters are really strong in pvp if you can play them right, same as titans. And same for warlocks. They‚Äôre all good depending on your playstyle. Play the class right and it excels. That‚Äôs what makes a good player~
---
Outlaw Rampage.
---
I don‚Äôt see the ghost ghost shell
---
That reload speed so long the D3 is out when you done 
---
Why tf didn't they just make him 100% cgi. He's not a human he's a genie he's meant to look unreal..
---
It looks natural.
---
Depends, kill clip is better for pvp because longer up time, and rapid hit would be easier to proc in a gunfight where you have to dip out before you get a kill. But pve? For sure outlaw rampage.
---
Don't mean to ruin the fun but maybe putting a phone number out like that isn't a very good idea?
---
He clearly said Xbox 
---
The machinist counts as a story mission, so you can do it whenever it is in the heroic story missions playlist, it is not tied to the flashpoint. 
---
r/sharditkeepit
---
Then don't.
---
Ah now that I read it instead of skimming through it, makes way more sense now. I feel stupid.
---
You don't know what auto-correct is, do you?
---
Blur out the phone number please 
---
Both regular and taken vandals, hobgoblins, and vex cyclops are higher in my list
---
For real
---
That's really interesting. I guess it says a lot about how good the weapon diversity/balance is right now in PvE when I only really use 5/15 on that list on a regular basis. Even less in non-raid play. 
---
&gt; Hunters have the worst jump, at least in terms of mobility.
---
Hunters have the best jump for PvP and its not even close, you have the ability to precisely control your vertical game. And have you tried stompees with strafe jump? It's absolutely insane mobility. Titans have skating which is completely broken but it will get fixed. Warlock jump is a big yikes for PvP.
---
You don't even have to crouch during the kill to proc flawless execution, you just get the kill and immediately crouch after. It's so stupidly easy to proc.
---
1 HIT MELEES ARE WEAK AS FUCK IN A SHOTGUN META I don't know how many times I have to scream this until it sinks in.
---
You're so typical man. A sub par PvP player who does not know how to play the class to the max, complaining about other classes. You've never even tried the nade wombo combo. How can you even begin to complain about how weak your class is when you don't even know how to use it?
---
You have to put the wish in before Kali so any deaths that would prevent a flawless run but still permit the Petra's Run would be from people drying on the jumping part getting to Kali or getting to the Wall of Wishes.
---
I don‚Äôt get people who waste their super chasing one person down like they have some sort of personal vendetta
---
He only vez I don‚Äôt like is the ducking cyclops with the one sho cyclops blast... experienced it way too many times at the izanami forge 
---
Loo terminator vibes hahaha
---
I don‚Äôt care if you have 2 motes you better bank before invading
---
I literally got the one I didn't want, the Kill Tracker.
---
I'll take the Taken one, the tall one, the Generalist one or the Hunter one. 
---
I have literally never heard of a Fortnite player saying that. It tends to be Apex Legends players who are sick of other Apex Legends players continuing the circlejerk.
---
Very, very nice....
---
Please tell me you Range as the MW ?
---
That‚Äôs auspicious 
---
The Cabal are what we stepped into war with on Mars.
---
Hive in gambit is the worst thing ever
---
What makes it that good BTW?
---
Rampage and quick reload is quite common now for HC no? 
---
That's weird. I thought I was going against the meta running Breakneck/NoB. Finished the Temptation LW quest step with this loadout. 
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
no actually, im stuck on the Dominus Ghaul fight. thats the issue isnt it?
---
Juicy
---
#DayOfTheFist my brother
---
the fuck is meme awards?
---
The Whisper of the Worm mission is probably one the best exotic quests in the game and I'm pretty confident you should have access to it. It's not easy to acquire, you will need a fireteam (can be done solo, just takes a lot of practice) but it's super fun I recommend looking up how to get it started.
---
And people ask why its bad to cluster. Because if bungie ever did fix it thats thousands of people who have not a clue wtf to do 
---
I love how Midnight Coup is still one of the top weapons, it really is D2‚Äôs Fatebringer
---
Honestly this is better.
---
Laugh at them 
---
Dude dont bother grinding to 300 is not worth it
---
It is much easier to increase your power level past 300 after you buy forsaken
---
From what I've seen, the only thing locked behind silver is an emote, the tiny bow. Everything else can either be earned via Shaxx or the engrams you get via levelling up
---
Figure of speech my dude
---
Players who do not at least own Warmind need to be 100% carried through Whisper. The enemies are power level 400, if I remember correctly, meaning you must be \*a bare minimum\* of 350 to deal damage at all. 
---
Every single Taken enemy is a more annoying version of their normal counterpart. Awesome design and super interesting lore but just fucking irritating to fight.
---
The difference is I'll admit i made a mistake even though I've used it in all my other comments correctly and unlike you I'm not going to edit it out so there is no proof that I made a mistake. Keep being toxic kid.
---
The new nova warp. 
---
don't complain about it, it's secretly a hard light side car &gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;
---
Maybe it's because your not good at it rather?
---
You are in luck, Crimson Days, the current one week long holiday event, has another high power level item you can get. Do Shaxx's Crimson Days bounties and save up hearts until you can get The Vow. 
---
Ah damn, I thought it was 280! You'd be right about the damage in that case. Apologies for the mislead there. If OP is on Xbox I'd be happy to help out though if needed.
---
The LFG discord for PC is full of poeple who say "LFG driven NO CHEESE". You ask em why and they get all offended
---
How many grenades did you throw? Did you count them?
---
I'm just looking for something to do until I get it, so I've been playing alot of crucible.
---
Since d1.... Day one!!
---
Ruby Rose's sparrow 
---
I got this exact roll with a range master work but I got pulse monitor instead of rampage :(... trying to use it more to see if it‚Äôs worth using more then dust rock or toil and trouble. 
---
And it's still going down
---
What I love about Monarque in forges is that I know that if I connect and get the poison debuff, I can just move on to fighting the next thing and know it's going to die.
---
Fucking weebs -- Also weebs
---
Quick google search says the split isn't far apart from general population, so the reason is "there are more hunters in the game overall"
---
How about taken?
---
