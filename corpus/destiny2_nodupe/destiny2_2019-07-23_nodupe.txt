Like your progress or the game?

---
---
Yes. My campaign progress, items, characters, etc.

If you don‚Äôt want to lose points you can just wait for iron banner tomorrow

Yes it'll all transfer

Google Translate te ha fallado.
---
Alright Cool!!! Thanks I was nervous there for a second.
---
Aaaaah, I watched a video about it. I'm sure it was Houndish but I'm not positive.
---
Use a 180 fs -- ikelos, nature of the beast, cold sweat, service revolver, trust, malfeasance, etc. If none of those, try luna, NF,  or rose. 
---

---
The Rose is the sleeper here, imo. So good.
---
Depends on what you're asking for. If it's your progress/rank on games like Destiny or Diablo then it is saved to your account and will sync. If you mean the local files for the game, then no, it will have to reinstall the game.
---
Technically you could transfer the data over yourself, and if you re-use the same drive from the old computer on the new one it would already be there. Depends on what exactly you're doing.
---
Is that the official?
---
Just need the EP helm for Wayfarer myself. Glad RNGesus finally came through for ya.
---
This happen to me recently after reformatting my hard drive. Put the cursor over D2 press the menu button&gt;Manage game &amp; add ons&gt;Ready to install see if any D2 content is available to download. If not go the the see in Microsoft store option and scroll to Forsaken and see if you can download it from there.
---
Huumm...
---
Blast. 
---
I really dunno beyond that check. I‚Äôve had it happen with Division where I had to manually go in and download the DLC that way, and was hoping it was the same fix.
---
It is indeed! üòÄ
---
Lol it‚Äôs bottom tree on nightstalker. Not a bug
---
Orpheus rig. 
---
Thing naturally shoots six without the exotic.  I think you can get like 10 off before your super is out.
---
Ive only got a few more wins left so Im just on normal grinding for Mountaintop rn lol
---
Me about to finish this mission.
---
Tank: I'm about to end this man whole carrer
---
Oof, thanks. I knew six was normal, that‚Äôs why I was confused.
---
Wait, for real? The piece from the weekly bounty rotates? I guess I only noticed it when it's been the helm. Fml lol.
---
*Shaxx Voice: "This is ridiculous."*

Made with Bazzart

When I go to find Forsaken it doesn‚Äôt say that I can download it

First thing I could find. Hopefully the closure you feed

Thanks anyways
---
Can‚Äôt afford Photoshop lol
---
How you did'nt get whiplash is beyond physics.
---
So what I did was load up a nightfall go into a lost sector. Got my arc kills easy with Insurmountable Skullfort, brawler, and arc burn. Then just finished my fusion rifle kills.

Yessir. U doing it legit or üßÄ?

Need 2 more people

Where are the talon things on the sights? Jk this is dope

Now I can‚Äôt unsee it thanks bro

My friend, I‚Äôm sure you meant to bestow that title to travelers chosen. The most op and highest dps weapon this franchise has ever seen
---
Because only so many get made and companies like Bestbuy and GameStop are only allocated so many of the higher tier versions.
---
Oh ya it's life-size
---
Guide buttonel, LB twice, select Looking For Group, select Destiny 2, browse posts, search, make your own.
---
That‚Äôs how I felt when I hopped on to Iron Banner and kept getting clapped by J√∂tunn, and I haven‚Äôt got mine yet. Grinder my ass off for about 2 resets worth of frames and finally got mine! 
---
Good luck with your chase!
---
I've got one more reset to grind out for dredgen. I do enjoy gambit for most part though.
---
Lord T H I X X
---
Keep it up mate, looks awesome!
---
I hope you have better luck than I (only 1 BN drop with hundreds of forges completed).

Thank you (:

Me but with full auto shotguns where you just rack the slide really fast.

I think I know the problem

Nightfalls are pretty easy.
---
Open director, go to pursuits tab. It's far left tab.
---
Thanks for the explanation, but I was more interested in the fact that it was on a random item you were told to dismantle. I think it‚Äôs just a glitch, but why would stats be on an item? I mean, a mod I could understand, but an item?
---
I've been going for recluse and my team is so ass that I have to carry with Duke .44
---
Most likely, the search bar thinks so too "Froge's voice"
---
That‚Äôs not a bad combo :)
---
Ya I wish there was a way to guarantee drops  like with the armor
---
 No, ill say whatever i want.
---
Im sorry it upsets you, but.....why does it upset you.
---
I thought I didn't like pvp but I just started to get recluse and found that I like it
---
Yeah fam, black armory was steller.
---
Loved those intense reskined escalation protocol moments.
---
It does not necessarily upset me but it is just that if i am being honest people are babies about that now a days and I just wanted to say that now you will get in trouble for saying things like that
---
Sounds like something a ghost would say
---
I feel you. Luckily I was about 2 ranks away from fabled and I had just gotten last word and had a pretty damn good roll of dust rock blues so I just switched off those 2 weapons when I needed to carry
---
If I remember correctly, "The Unsolvable Problem" is a quest. So, just like you said, it's probably a glitch.
---
I‚Äôve always liked PVP for the most part but that competitive grind really made me rethink it. Recluse is such a fun weapon though and pairs well with so many things that it makes it so fun
---

If they ban me for criticism, then i dont want to be here.

How was it anything like EP?

You're joking?
---
Those rose tinted goggles must be glued on...
---
And you k ow I support that way of thinking also that is exactly what happened to one of my clan mates and you k ow what he did he left the clan then so did I and the rest of the people that played with him
---
I like it, but I like poison more...
---
There is no way to reasonably explain this except to say that it's a JoJo's reference
---
Okay
---
At 1k if you habe the right mentaliy yes
---
WAIT WHAT WAS THAT, looked like the dude pulled out a baby lord of wolves. I guess that‚Äôs why my friend rages at that gun
---
Man got mad none of y‚Äôall would put one down, so now you‚Äôve gotta work for it.
---
Perfect title. 10 out of 10 would read again.

... I am not a smart man

The 7 cores were more useful than the gun

It says that when you get marked for vengeance by two different titans tho...

That's kinda what I thought after looking at the perks haha. Whole reason I made the post.

'No my son, what you need are 3 more slightly different versions of The Stag and weapons you already unlocked'.

Grinding for Wendigo made me feel like a human firing at agents from the Matrix.

I‚Äôve seen guardians empty entire magazines from fighting lion and hit nothing but air

Oh boy I sure do love riven‚Äôs

#tummy tentacles
---
I can't answer that first question and I never said Luna's wasn't counterable but it was so good that it was literally all anybody ran. Like why do you think its a meme to see 6 stacks running NF or Luna's, cause it happened so much that everyone got sick of it.
---
Everything is better than anthem

#ever heard of grinding?

Likely never
---
Just report them for hate speech/racism. They get a chat ban and get flagged if they‚Äôre a repeat offender
---
It's literally one of the easiest pinnacle weapons ever, just play strikes for like 5 hours and your done. Bam. Especially if you load into one with blind well or escalation , just ignore the strike with a team and farm kills.
---
they upped the drop chance not too long ago, its a 20% chance
---
\^moral of the story
---
 Holy
---
soon ‚Ñ¢
---
Now my favourite D1 exotics will be back. Peregrine Greaves and Monte Carlo. I hope it gets some kind of buff like OBP and Bad Juju did.
---
I know the 'Titans pve is the worst' bandwagon is hard to avoid on this sub, but it's not true! Titans are inferior in ONLY 1 thing for pve. Raid boss fights. At the highest tiers where you have a full raiding team with perfect composition, titans struggle to find a niche in many encounters. 
---
That's the only thing. 
---
As far as murdering mass amounts of enemies go? Titans have great neutral  game and some great exotic combos that wreck the other classes shit.
---
Peacekeepers+Recluse 
---
Use top tree striker for shoulder charge with an aoe explosion and two fucking grenades. You have absolute God level add clear and recluse shits on everything. 
---
Actium war rig+breakneck is a close second for crazy add clear. 
---
And do you know what 90% of this game is? Non raid boss add clear.
---
I can almost hear some weird fan saying: "Yes please punish me Lord Shaxx!"
---
Yeah, moons haunted.
---
most of them are based on other, more popular, non-destiny based memes (visit sites like 9gag to learn more)
---
Probably never. I would love random rolls on duty bound.

Taken Ogre make thing go weeee and for some reason you fly higher when holding a charged grenade.

Sounds like something someone that own lunar real estate would say... I'm on to you

Countdown would be a better gametype of it wasn't lasting for 6 ROUNDS.

Try win

you can use a public event flag before you load in to at least have full heavy. you'll lose your super though
---
Nah this was more fun . Idiot.
---
Sometimes I don't understand why some people breathe.
---
Some people play different things, I met a guy yesterday who is 740 light and only plays the campaign and weekly story missions
---
it‚Äòs one of the only hand cannons that i can get kills with in pvp
---
shoulder charge yes along with bottom tree striker
---
what plattform are you playing?
---
This also eill sometimes fix the invisibilty glitch in Crucible, if it doesn't dismantle a shader. Don't ask me why.
---
I want answers
---
STOP GIVING ME TIGERSPITE BUNGIE
---
Ah yes, edge transit, the living d2 meme. That‚Äôs an ok roll i guess.
---
Since you are a raid clan is it safe to assume u have squads with flawless raid clears?
---
It‚Äôs my only exotic engram in this piece of shit game. I have like easily 100+ hours and I only have 1 exotic drop. Why don‚Äôt they make some kinda insane hard activity that has like 20% chance of an exotic drop so I can actually grind something useful.
---
Tank cc or defender cc is my bet on him.
---
Sigma balls
---
How is that possible? Do you get points for AFK farming gambit?
---
I still miss that the titan slam was a hail mary play so if you wiped multiple people with it you deserved the accolades.
---
No idea my friend. I don't think you get infamy for losing
---
I bought it from B.Net yesterday.  
---
I had the game for free when Bungie was giving it away.

I am now a light a Guardian forever.

The grips...the game has me.

Are you Galactus sibling?

I never liked how the main character didn't talk.. same issue with D2.

I think one of the issues in legend is, that most people will stop playing once they hit legend.

Legit nearly pissed myself reading this.

True - but it's one of the negative sides of being an early adopter.

The image is fake, He's not holding lord of wolves

Field of view, mouse + keyboard.

I feel you - it's one of the prices you pay as an early adopter.

I have never done a flawless raid, but does it really count if people exit to orbit and join back in?

100% I hope it matures fast.

I think it‚Äôs the first and third. Sort of an abridged look at his descent into madness.

TY :) It'll fix itself I guess :D

WHAT IS THAT MELODDEEEEEEEEE
---
In my defence they had a prime before we had 25 notes I the bank. I was constantly bringing the prime back from less than half health and would barely have enough time to make it back to the portal before I had to go again. The only time I had to contribute was a few seconds occasionally of shooting ads from next to the portal. I also got the achievement for recovering a round from less than 25 motes.
---
Nothing official has been announced yet, just the origin story reveal trailer. 
---
All we know now is ‚Äúmini black holes I guess.‚Äù
---
Perhaps later today we‚Äôll get the breakdown of his abilities.
---
As I like Marvel fans, they see familiar names everywhere.  My answer is no when I started using my nickname I did not know about the existence of these comics.
---
the first two cancel each other out and the third is weaker than the majority of other supers; also any class can use tractor
---
You got a lotta nerve for someone marked for vengeance
---
\*Insert Luigi\*
---
In my defence for the third round the enemies killed their prime in less than a minute.
---
Jesus Christ
---
U would have to use the liars handshake arcstrider hunter build
---
No, you gotta complete it to reset it
---
The irony
---
Beside the fact the game is stale because of 2-2-2.
---
Oh and the vast majority of characters are just bad and are never picked besides to joke around.
---
Alright
---
Thanks
---
Man I haven't even played Titan
---
But how is my Darth Helmut Titan gonna know hes reached ludicrous speed?
---
??????? 
---
Name a few please. Most characters are viable if you are good with them, unless you are in Masters or GM
---
Been playing for a month and still have no clue lol
---
Not trying to talk shit because obviously you killed it, but what were you running to get over 200 kills and zero precision?
---
Depends on the map. If the map is small and exclosed tha. Striker can rip face (unless he is facing off the whole enemy team in which case its death) but dawnblade is just more broken in an open map seeing nothing besides a lucky tether can kill it.
---
This is amazing !
---
It's been the last week of the season for the past two maybe three seasons

Now just because you said that they're going to nerf it like they did to Khepri's sting

Going for an easy pinnacle weapon for the moments seal.

Golden Gun can off him.

You?

203 kills yet 0 precision kills, what went down here?
---
ok bud
---
Yo dipshit.
---
I had a perfect polite conversation with another person in the comments.
---
Im not being polite to you, because you're an idiot.
---
Is that ok if I ask how to do this storylane? How to trigget and what shoud I do to ascess that? Have not to much free time and finding something new via some manuals on youtube. Way to the Dreaming City was found accidentally but cant see any clear chain of quests like in Red Legion story and Wamind or Curse of Osiris. Sorry for my weird ENG.
---
[removed]
---
Game is stale? And 4 tanks and 2 healers was healthier? At least now they can balance towards the 2-2-2 making it more of a balanced game.
---
I run recluse in strikes and my stats normally end up looking like this
---
Havent watch or played the game in years (last was when doomfist was released) and pretty much bastion, hanzo, lucio, mccree, orisa, pharah, reaper, (think roadhog got slapped with a nerf not that long ago during this time) roadhog, sombra, symmetra, torb, and widow.
---
That leaves 13 characters that are good. Less depending on the map.
---
Did you do the pinnacle weapons yet? And what are you playing on? If it‚Äôs Xbox let me know, I can get a group together most days.
---
Could you call this a Celestial Opera? I'll call this a Celestial Opera.
---
I remember in D1, you could play Sunbreaker with the breaking hammers, Melting Point, AND heal on kill. Too bad you can‚Äôt do unique subclass load outs anymore...
---
Nonetheless, I‚Äôm curious to see what they‚Äôll do to Sunbreaker. I have a feeling that they won‚Äôt touch bottom or top tree and just modify middle tree, though.
---
For now, until they inevitably get nerfed into the ground.
---
Please, Orpheus suck now as far as getting it back like it was.

Congratulations on surviving the grind.  I am still 1 item away from Wayfarer.

Blades do no where damage like they use to to a boss, and arc strider is iffy at best. Duration sucks

Thank you:). May throw it on a surface grinder to give it a shiny, mirror-like finish

No need for flexing when role queue comes out. It‚Äôs gonna be super easy finding a match as a support or tank.

I do wanna know who thought that item was a good idea.

30 from the Calus Statue (split into 6 categories of 5 each) 14 from Triumphs, and the initial one you're given to unlock the hall. Plus the 5 dogs count.

He asked what if they turn him on
---
Perhaps in the future, you could include your actual opinion in the post instead of making it low effort. Why make us guess what your message is here? I guessed that you were mad (like so many others right now) that they sold this for $10 and now its for bright dust. But, in fact, you are happy about it?
---
I guess I just don't understand why you would make this post and not include your opinion and instead let everyone try and guess what you were trying to say. Pretty low effort.
---
That‚Äôs why I now sold my soul to lootcifer and never looked back. Have every god roll I need
---
I feel a little wimpy for using the feedback fences most of the time in crucible, but they have actually saved me from a couple shoulder charges. That was the most panicking I've seen out of a Titan so far.
---
Either way, I think you'll have to choose between bringing your d2 save over from PC and saving your d1 characters. From what bungie has said there won't be any save merging.
---
You'll likely have to create an account and merge your stuff over on PS4, then bring that save over to your steam account. You'll be starting fresh on PC though.
---
Oh ok
---
Sometimes 'love' means a good thing, my fellow Guardian.
---
Have a good day.

When you hover over the frames, there is a line of text saying they turn back into whatever it cost to purchase them on the weekly reset.
---
https://youtu.be/t7mbxPTCmUI
---
Ah shit...I'm a dummy.  A lazy dummy.  Thanks for pointing out what should have been obvious
---
I think the countdown was to start a damage phase, the fact that all the golden guns were used at the start is the coincidence. And before people say that hunters always use golden gun first, I'm a hunter main and if I had no really bericade or Luna well I would empty a clip of heavy first then golden
---
This is how black armory frames work. Allow me to inform you of how the game works.
---
At weekly reset, all weapon frame progress is reset and materials used to purchase the frame are refunded. This is to prevent an issue that happened a long time ago where when you carried them over weeks, you would lose access to frames in the second week after carrying a frame over. 
---
So the game is literally just doing what its designed to do. Moral of the story, don't work on black armory frames right around the weekly reset.
---
They have to be completed they week you get them from Ada. Its in the text of the frame.
---
Almost perfect
---
Nice
---
Wow
---
[The creator's website, where he has some other helpful infographics!](https://www.niris.tv/)

Getting an army of one immediately teleports you back to your side, so you don't have a chance to grab any notes. It wouldn't be bad if OP had picked up 3 motes from his first kill and then getting the army of one.
---
and sometimes it doesn't. Fuck me for asking you to be clear in your messaging on your posts. LOL I'll just block you as you clearly don't care that your post is low effort and vague.
---
According to this post there are...

*Misses the shot*
---
Great, you're focusing the raodhog as zen, barely able to take him down alone or maybe even you manage it. Meanwhile your other healer, let's just say it's a core healer (although let's not lie to ourselves, it propably wont be a core healer) struggles to keep the team alive because you deposited your orb of healing on a target that is already full. 
---
Thing is that a good player might know how to offset their weakness but that doesn't mean that it is eliminated. They are just as vulnerable to their designated counter picks than before they just know how to not get near them. Not getting near them wont do you any good though and they will still loose if they dont adapt. The game literally tried to reward people for switching to counter a strong picks, it was the idea that Jeff Kaplan and other devs had in mind when making that game as evident from their early interviews. I dont know why exactly they want to push forced roles now when generalist and versatility has been rewarding up until that point.
---
Also, nice of you to talk about sources when you're making source less claims yourself, no offense. A comprehensive data sheet is propably non existing, but I'd reccomend checking out the pro scene after the ana release and what the teamcomps consisted of. Overwatch dataspace was a nice project in that regard, showing that, for example, the top 5 comps in may of 2017 consisted of mainly Lucio ana + 3 tanks. After that came the dive meta with the rework of dva which stretched into 2018 and then came Brigitte and introduced goats. As I have played OW a lot myself back then and fluctuate between plat and master I noticed that these comps were favoured by many teams and as such also had a surprisingly high winrate if everyone knew what they were doing.
---
The guy on the right describes me...
---
Hunter is quite versatile, the supers are great in pvp and pve
---
Probably because our supers were smash, bubble, or hammers. Everyone I knew used hammers.
---
Sunspot tree is so fun though
---
I read it as you love them for offering it for bright dust instead of JUST money. Which... I FUCKING DO AS WELL! It's just an emote but I'm so excited I'm able to spend my bright dust on it instead of real money! That seems super genuine and cool, man. Also, I'm at work so haven't checked eververse... But is that an exotic opulence sparrow I'm seeing???
---
Be my guest.
---
Take care, really. No sarcasm. I mean it. Really.
---
Aw man you missed out on the glory that was the Sepiks Prime strike! Sepiks was a simple giant servitor fight, but it was the first strike you do and oh my god it was glorious, [the music is god damn iconic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58zXA03mbu0). It's similar to the Ether Harvest public event but in a confined room with fallen spawning everywhere and just a total shitshow of survival.
---
When Rise of Iron came out I was running strikes with mates and we dropped into a RoI variant of Sepiks Prime. Didn't think much of it, it's Sepiks we've done this a million times, it's just got some SIVA flavour. Then we entered the room and we hear the music start. [It got an exquisite metal remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9N4PSgvpd2A)

Sorry I meant the quest. Each quest step unlocks a piece of armor.

Yeah, thats my hope

I don't always like to eat Shaxx's ass, skate fast and smoke grass... but when i do this is what his back door looks when im done, Lil Guardian.

Sorry if everyone already knows about this one, but I was very curious. Does anyone know about this room or if it has a purpose?
---
field prep
---
If you have arbalest I highly recommend using that for shields. If not, then hard light or borealis since they let you switch the element type. Other than that just make sure your energy/power weapons/subclass cover the three elements; shields will slow you down so being able to deal with them is important.
---
Another tip that made things INFINITELY easier for me is make sure you take down the snipers first and then deal with mobs on the ground, after the snipers are gone the other mobs are trivial.
---
AC Feedback fence has a siva ornament.
---
it has no purpose and it has been discovered since black armory droped but congratulations os finding it yourself
---
&gt; players who have multiple accounts will need to choose which account they want to cross-save with. 
---
I mean this is pretty clear to me. I will look for clearer info if I can, but I can assure you, you pick one that is a global "Cross Save" account, the others will just be locked to their current platform. I am not sure how you would pick to log into your "Cross Save" account versus your PC only account, but I am pretty sure that is how it would work. 
---
Seems like it would be MORE messy to have multiple accounts all with cross save enabled.
---
Way before.. waaaay before

But how would the cross save system know that one person's multiple accounts are all the same person?

Darn I was hoping there would be more to the mystery. Thanks for letting me know!

God roll is basically spike grenades plus as much velocity as you can get.

Yes, for weapon upgrades, enchancments, infusions and more.

Well, there are some online solvers or combination sheets, which you're probably using. I've encountered some problems last time I did a Void config (some combos didnt work).

Triple check you do everything right, and if your fault is not the case, then sadly, you have to run through again.

Thats 99999 IQ for sure, holy shit man, you take my upvote.
---
At the VERY LEAST they'll give compensation if it does go fucky, so you should be fine if you're planning on playing it soon anyway.
---
Congrats. Now you can wait three months to get the seal in the mail, if you ordered one, which you must.
---
NOTE: unfortunately this strategy most likely requires friends
---
Well, the two exotic special shotguns are very long range. Especially Lord of Wolves, also Chaparone can kill from absurd ranges as well provided you get a headshot due to its slug ammo type
---
You can also use them for Black Arkory mods with ADA-1.
---
I wish I had mine by they still have my order listed as Unfulfilled.
---
If people used a gun other than recluse to mow me down before I can even ads. Then maybe I'd stop shoulder charging.
---
Absolutely. But some times it‚Äôs not enough.
---
It only takes a couple of teammates to drift away for the other team to cause plenty of damage.
---
And I‚Äôm agreeing with you: this shouldn‚Äôt happen, yet, it sometimes does.
---
I saw someone who had 6000 guardian kills with their Erentil and the whole match I only died to him which that damned gun.
---
I think bungie needs to see this. Don't know if this is a hacker or a bug. I've never seen this personally but i have been kicked from two matches before immediately after killing a player on pc which seems very suspicious. Idk, maybe it's a bug but it does seem very strange.
---
At this point your Kinetic is your secondary weapon tbh
---
Yeah, I missed a word
---
LOL üòÇ hahahaha that's crazy 6000 guardian kills
---
I mostly solo crucible. Control is one of those gamemodes where you can lose quickly but there‚Äôs also a chance to recover. 
---
It‚Äôs almost impossible to recover in iron banner though. All about holding and defending zones and recapturing zones instead of rushing kills.
---
Slim thicc
---
That is a Titan on its peak performance ! Nice footage !
---
What the point of using a titan and not having MASSIVE GOD DAMN PAULDRONS!!!
---
It's kind of like  a square is a rectangle, but a rectangle is not a square. Iron Banner is a Crucible playlist, which is why Crucible bounties work for it, but it doesn't work the other way around.
---
Yea I've been killing it with the Titan lately.  Thanks!
---
Aaaaaaaaand... how‚Äôd it go?
---
*misses furiously*
---
THIS IS AMAZING!!!
---
This is the piece I finished recently for Myelin Games depicting Toland and the Bad Juju. I also got a chance to expand on my dark armor set I'm making for each class that my chat has lovingly named "Nevermore". Having done the titan's first with my Dredgen Yor piece, and now the warlock's with Toland, I'll have to find an excuse to make the Hunter's version. If you'd like to watch the speed painting you can do so here:

---
Meh could‚Äôve been further off
---
Exos are completely self aware AIs created originally by the Clovis Bray Corporation during the golden age. They were quickly accepted by society as ‚Äòpeople‚Äô. In short, not really like what you‚Äôre suggesting.
---
Yep. About 100 mats an hour. Just picked up my 1800 mats this morning
---
Once you get one. You unlock it in collections. If you go into your collections tab. Can get as many as you want out. Hope that helps.
---
no explosive pyre never came back sadly, what we have is "Solar ability kills generate sunspots"
---
*granted what they DON'T tell you is that Khepri's Horn, burn damage from Polaris and I think from Prospector can also proc this*
---
2 3 4 and 6 dont need anything honestly, theyre do what theyre meant to do and id argue lupi does it damn well, 1,8 and 7 need some touch ups for sure though especially feedback and wormgod bc theyre essentially useless compared to hunters liars handshake
---
let me actually check
---
out of 25 9-10 are great 
---
7 are ok and that leaves 9-8 as bad (buffwinterssoitisn'tauselessexotic)
---
I started up destiny yesterday and I'm at like 350 light or something. What did I miss?! Haha. I thought I could get a quest that bumped me to 6xx but the robot didn't have the invitation quest for me. I have the $99 version of the game so I'm assuming I have the season pass.
---
Looks kinda like Lord Zedd from Power Rangers
---
i was in this game, im still at a loss

O

Go into the flair section of the collections and if you go to shaders and look through them you should be able to claim more at the cost of legendary shards or glimmer

Flared magwell, greatly increases reload and slightly increases stability
---
Why this true?
---
Ah you too are a man of culture
---
Praise the sun!
---
exactly i actually found out about wormgod needing that buff while doing testing to see if i can replace hunter one two punch (spoiler can't because 4 second duration both warlocks and titans) but bottom tree striker can oneshot greg
---
also lupi creates more orbs but titans aren't really the orb class and alpha lupi's heal is outclassed by one eyed
---
Awesome, thanks guys!
---
Didnt want to sleep anyway
---
~~wait what prospecotor is arc anyways cool how did i do this oh is see i missclicked~~
---
Already have toster and now so now I'm just "curated plz?" I need that fucking shader gdi
---
Dude I feel ya. I'd grind for Recluse over this man... Like it can be frustrating but Recluse is easily (ish) obtainable in a season... This damn thing took me three seasons
---
*burn damage from Prospector, haven't really tested it myself since hardly anything survives the explosion*
---
I‚Äôm sorry but I wish there was a better way you could have done this poll. Like maybe have people just number the destinations and then add all their values up or something. That would probably be a more vague result than what you‚Äôre looking for but I just spent like 5 minutes trying to track which ones I had and hadn‚Äôt used lol
---
Trench will be more often used than surrounded and I personally would go with trench
---
Copy, paste, more money please.
---
Yes

Would be great if eris was the vendor/npc for the main part of the moon and then later in the expansion we unlock a new area and discover saint 14 who becomes the second NPC. Similar to how we got spider in the tangled shore and petra in the dreaming city. I think he may warrant his own dlc though since he's such a legendary figure in the lore.
