What is it called

---
There was a bug with that a couple of months back.
---

---
That person didn't play enough Gambit to reset 508 times.
---
These are the Curse of Osiris lost prophecy quest items. They aren't planet materials.
---
That thing is taller than me. If it was a working gun it would blow me off my feet to shoot.

Nice, i would have to sacrifice qay too many shards in order to make the same joke

was the xol fight hard?

I miss that helmet

There‚Äôs a spectrum between complete caring and complete uncaring.  I‚Äôm sure they care insomuch as ppl play/pay, but I don‚Äôt think their main priority is fixing problems or providing an enjoyable experience.  It seems to me their priority is creating a gameplay loop around every facet of the game.  
---
But I could be wrong ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
^seventh^column
---
how is that in meters?
---
I read they increased the drop rate, or rather, it works like nightfall loot, in that your chance increases per character each time you open one and don‚Äôt get an ornament.  Dmg04 in the forums made it sound like that happened Friday/Saturday.
---
What helm is that ?
---
Is Skullfort better than Synthoceps for a Striker Titan in PvE?
---
Woah! Thats crazy good. What did you use to make it?
---
Thanks for complain No.20984901 nothings gonna change for 2 more weeks get over it and join em
---
It‚Äôs 3D printed with PLA plastic, lots of sanding to get it nice and smooth!
---
Bungie don't read these forums
---
Also thank you :) very proud of it. I have it mounted on my wall
---
I use Sony Vegas pro 16, I find it to be rather easy to use after you get over that initial curve of WHAT am I doing?
---
Saved, this is beautiful.
---
Your welcome, but thats still crazy! How long did it take to make it?
---
Around 10 hours roughly maybe less
---
Congrats, Mountaintop is a excellent and fun weapon to use in PvP with sticky nades and a Major/Boss killer in PvE with spike nades n major/boss spec.  I always use it in gambit when I'm running Lunafaction warlock, always come out as the highest damage dealer.
---
You... you genuinely believe that these developers don‚Äôt care about making the game they are developing enjoyable?!
---
Well that's just bad. I mean I pay for a service so I can use it. Like If you don't want problems don't drastically change parts of the game. Like I don't expect to play a game like Legend of Zelda then out of nowhere the creators get the ability to make it a battle Royale and make it the only playable mode for 3 weeks. Like no. I didn't agree to that. And really it's not what I thought I was paying for.
---
Dang. Obv you have great skill. Any other future projects?
---
I hear you, and understand what Shin is saying. Don't forget though that a side must be chosen and walking in the middle doesn't clarify your side. Shin is also using very deceptive tactics to accomplish a dark objective. Think upon this, Shin has shown he is capable spinning the truth. This is not a trustworthy characteristic. He brutally sacrificed someone he knew to create deception. Does this not sound just like the cunningness of Savathun? Fruits of your labor and Shin's are showing darkness at the core.
---
Do not simply follow in Shin's beliefs because he has painted himself a victim, or because you connect with him and therefore trust his ideas. Plans rooted in evil should always be avoided. My attention will be sharpest when interacting with Shin, but I will not be blindly seeking after his ideas. Darkness would want you to believe it can co-exsist with the Light. This lowers the guard of Light and gives Darkness the edge it's always needed.
---
Midnight Coup, Ikelos SG, Wardicliff coil. Good for all the encounters in the raid
---
It was a cross post so the title from him stayed
---
Was not expecting. Did not disappoint.
---
That really sucks
---
Same man, it takes like 30 seconds max to find a game of QP, and 90 for comp, the loading is what takes forever.
---
What ship is that?
---
RESPECT!!!
---
I wish i was that good
---
I was gonna go for NF because LH made me curious, but I went from Fabled 3 to Heroic 3, so it's not happening, and I've made peace with that.
---
We have created are own understandings of the Travelers actions. If we aren't in a noble crusade from being antagonized then what are we doing? Just some random spec of existence? Our lives are a daily battle against forces that bring anguish. Is our response to be submissive?
---
Power will do as the wielder permits. Power doesn't by itself cause corruption. There are many accounts of people using Power for good. Just as there are those who would use power for evil.
---
just played 4 games and got 1% movement in calculated trajectory medal progress...
---
Remember press space to jump
---
noted! I was rolling wormhusk for health + shield bump, arbalest and trust. worked out pretty dang well till I slipped over that edge, lmaoo
---
This is awesome
---
Hunter rockin those sick Timbs

if it was easy everyone would have it
---
Holy shit this is amazing. So in depth. Shame it didn‚Äôt see the light of front page.
---
You should be able to deflect missile titans with middle tree pole dancer
---
Damn! I wish I had one. But it‚Äôs yours, not mine.
---
Tigerspite. You get it from the dreaming city bounties that give powerful gear from Petra.
---
Then you fall on the ground and lose consciousness. When you wake up, you're in a jail cell and a dark elf is trash talking you from the other cell in front....

Because you got sniped peaking a known sniper lane ? Lmao get the fuck outta here with that salt

---
Damnit it‚Äôs at 69 upvotes I cant upvote it now
---
Needs more skip grenade
---
Possibly unpopular opinion: I like the more sci-fi looking armor in Destiny 2 a *lot* more. What bugs me more is the amount of armor pieces with sections that can't be recolored! So many sets with bright   colors in them that don't change with different shaders, super disappointing when you're trying to make your own custom look
---
Issa joke. Plus. I was trying to see if someone would cross that corner in front of me. I didn't expect snipers in the back. Chill
---
This is a great set up man. Reminds me of The Juggernaut from X-Men
---
Always next week arrrrrrrr

"Can't really do that when I'm dying to Fighting Lion/Mountaintop, Militia's Birthright, Shadowshot, and Play of the Game" like, do you realize how you sound?
---
PvP is really fun, especially right now when you can spam infinite void tackles and have get your super up **twice** before anyone gets theirs up! Like, what actually scares people about PvE?
---
Arcbolt with top tree can chain infinitely and wipe teams by itself
---
My Exo gets called "Outsider" a lot by the quest givers in the Dreaming City.
---
if only I had some decently rolled sunbreaker armor pieces
---
Don't get me wrong this hear is horribly rolled.
---
Been there, just finished it on sunday :D Had to try a few times, but it felt really good once i got it.
---
I don't know any of the statistics, but I think warlocks are generally the least picked class? Aside for late game PvE, where they're mandatory. Combined with the fact that their floaty jump is less effective at avoiding shots from players (Blink avoids this, but is also harder to use) , I imagine most players feel like they're weaker than the other classes in PvP. That said, Dawnblade is actually pretty sick, and the void subclasses still have a fair amount of neutral game utility IMO. It's a shame that hunters are so over picked, but I say that and still play one, so I can't complain.
---
Stompy boi*
---
oh alright then lmao
---
No, please, no extended range shotgun, please. It would break PvP even more than it already is. Besides, Saint-14 was known for singlehandedly defeating huge numbers of enemies on his own. Something like melee damage buff on kill which then buffs the weapon on melee kill or some kind of enhanced graverobber perk to overflow the mag or memento mori ripoff would be more characteristic of the lore IMO
---
First off: Luna's is a 3-tap gun. It's slightly better than other guns because it shoots at 180 rpm. 1KV is not great in Crucible, pretty good in Gambit. J√∂tunn: Have you tried stepping to your left?
---
Second: Skip nades? Counter it. Run suppressors. Run Riskrunner (an Exotic you get from the campaign!)! Run arcbolt warlock (way more OP and it doesn't even require an Exotic).
---
If you spend your whole time complaining, when are you going to have time to have fun? Listen, at first I was mad at the skip nades, didn't join them (I wanted to play Titan), so I used tackle Doomfangs + melee boost. Every game has a meta, doesn't mean you have to adhere to it. I finally broke 2100 this season and I'm almost 3000. I have barely used Luna's cuz I hate it. Like my Le Monarch too much.
---
TL;DR: If you're gonna be angry all the time, you'll never have time to have fun
---
I‚Äôve been Seismic Strike shoulder charged by a Hunter before.
---
I did this and also received hate :(
---
Use Monarque with a Snapshot Explosive Payload Hand cannon. I use Better Devils. If you headshot with Monarque, hot swap to BD and body shot, you can two tap with a stupid fast TTK.
---
Stop, you‚Äôve violated the law.
---
I was looking for mine in the vault... and it really had Ashes to Assets :D
---
Or landing just at the edge of a platform but the climbing animation doesn't start and you're forced to watch your guardian slide off the platform
---
Everyone here is wrong. Here‚Äôs how you do it.
---
You need a Hunter with Orpheus Rigs.
---
You need a Taken Armaments mod from Last Wish.
---
Go into the Heroic Whisper of the worm, and run to the green room. Drop down to the shadow Thrall spawn. Throw down a tether and let them come to you. Shoot one, it kills them all and counts them as being killed by Acrius. Once you run out of heavy, throw a grenade. You‚Äôre guaranteed to get heavy ammo because of how many the grenade will kill. Rinse and repeat until done. Took me 15 minutes. This works with Sleeper and other heavy weapon catalysts.
---
That pun was pawsome!
---
I mean, they're the ones that grouped up while the game was telling everyone you had blade barrage
---
Erentil is a hate mail generator, gunsmith drop. Range rolls all the way, you're gonna love it
---
390 pulses are great, Bygones Inagural Address Last Perdition look for a roll with kill clip and remember at close range no direct 1v1 with lunas until you're on a kill clip
---
Not sure what archetype but I'm told Blast Furnace is crazy good
---
Shotguns get the god roll dust rock that's still top tier, or Chaperone and get practicing because that's very rewarding if you're skilled
---
If it‚Äôs at the bridge in Reckoning I‚Äôm betting all my cores on the stompy boi.
---
I'm also in need of this. If you're on PS4 my name is BoomBriggs.
---
Really? Damn.
---
If that's your code that's fine but keep in mind nobody is obligated to play along, so no hating on people for using the spam.
---
Every time I read something like this I'm glad I'm on Xbox. I haven't seen anyone do it on there and I have done at least 4 weapon frames last week.
---
DIE! DIE! DIE!
---
Lol even a steel wall would lose xD He looks like he just puts his head through fucking taken cabal shields
---
Xbox sadly
---
I¬¥m so proud of this community you guys encourage people to try mountain climbing and I love that
---
Nothing scummy about it, you took your opportunity. 
---
It's their fault for not realising you had a super up, and being a blade barrage it's pretty much the done thing to run straight in at the start of a round as teams usually clump together. Let's hope they've learnt their lesson!
---
*Nothing kills gravity faster than a guardian* rip blade barrage flying
---
Focus on other exotics
---
Because you got critical shot off
---
Revelry thingy
---
But who will stop the pesky titans from spamming suppression nades?
---
You can avoid that lol
---
Ikr
---
That won't make sense, he would've smelt the whole lobby.
---
Neckst level stuff there.
---
You will get 120 points at the current rank.
---
That's why every team needs a tether hunter
---
ESCALATION PROTOCOL VI: The Double Dunkey.
---
It's us vs a taken Crash Bandicoot and Link from BOTW.
---
If I had to pick, first one with meyrin &amp; steady rounds selected. The second one is really, really bad. Air assault is an awful perk, headseeker isn‚Äôt much better, and reload MW is not what you want at all. The first one isn‚Äôt quite as bad as people are saying, particularly if you play on console. The combo of steady rounds/zen moment/stability MW will make it a laser like you said.
---
As for mods, avoid counterbalance as that actually makes the recoil worse. Backup mag or targeting adjuster.
---
decked
---
Wholesome
---
Most of the meta listed on warmind is HC and shotguns...12/20 slots kinetic/energy. 
---
There are 2 pulse rifles in the top 10 of kinetic. Bygones at 3 and blast furnace at 6. One in top 10 of energy. Last Perdition at 6. 
---
1 and 2 of kinetic are drb and ace. 3 is bygones. 4 is tlw and 5 is arbalest.  1 and 2 of energy are Luna and Trust. 3 is recluse and 4 is NF and 5 is Jotunn.
---
Yeah, but there's no reason that literally every boss in the game does it. Even the Public Event bosses do it.
---
You‚Äôre what‚Äôs wrong with this game, if a weapon is successful you cry for a nerf. Pulses don‚Äôt need a nerf, hand cannons and shotguns are the meta right now. Pulses are a great way to put some distance between you and and DRB, LH/NF.
---
In PvP they're ok. They're usually outplayed by other weapons except for the rare long ranged map.  
---
IN PvE I think they're quite good. I use a Blast Furnace with Feeding Frenzy and Rampage (Spec), and it basically has unlimited range, chews through everything.
---
No buy it now
---
in Lake of Shadows you see what happens when they don't do this
---
Hunter is a bitch class play warlock bro
---
Didn't say they directly needed a nerf, said either they need to be brought down or everything else needed a buff, either way works , but its a lot easier for bungie to nerf pulses. Also not crying at all, aksed for conversation not (bungie they're so op i cant play the game wahhhh) and i understand the distance but why cant autos or scouts do that? Because they're lackluster in comparison
---
Revelry Light is different from Tonic. Its under the buffs you see in your character screen. You can start up a nightfall and complete this as you can go into it solo.
---
have you seen suppressor + trip mine spam? you can't even jump away from that mess.
---
What do you mean by that? Are you saying that if you get an exitic bright engram drop you cannot get an exotic weapon/armor drop for a period of time?
---
funny part is during Y1, scouts dominated all and pulse rifles were a joke.  Didnt change until Forsaken, and I am ok with it.  You can still use any weapon effectively, just use what you enjoy and dont bother with what others use.  I still rock AoS, Waking Vigil and Hero Burdon in pvp or pve, I do fine.
---
Oh no that sounds horrible!
---
You use it for raid bosses if you want but mainly only scourge
---
why exactly? you need 2 headshots to 3 shot. service revolver with killclip needs a kill and can 3 shot and keep kill clip if you play agressive. aos needs 3 shots, 1 head, 2 body. thorn can 2 tap. duke can 2 tap. what makes you think these weapons are the worst addition to destiny? wave splitter can melt faster than lunas/nf. shotguns 1hko. arbalest one shots. snipers one shot. there are weapons easier to obtain with the same and lower ttk.
---
was that all of them? THAT WAS ALL OF THEM!!!
---
I legit enjoy the pvp only because of Shaxx‚Äôs callouts, so wholesome :&gt;
---
headshots is not a super high requirement in a game that aims for you
---
Every match and every person in that match is grenade spamming. I'm 1280 glory. I played 5 matches, all 100% full of grenade spammers.
---
Killed by the Guardians
---
?
---
I just don‚Äôt like losing to weapons that are either acquired through really good rng, or weapons that are objectively better than what I can use that I can only get by winning.
---
Yes, its Bungie Day as other users have commented.
---
r/killedbythearchitects

Sniping someone using a roaming super.
---
Headass bro don‚Äôt be a dick
---
Hey, get on D2, Kabr's ship is back
---
thanks i hate it
---
Just nerf em pls. No need for more powercreep
---
I actually like the boss grabbing you idea, I just don‚Äôt know how it will balance with the melee based abilities like melting point.
---
I said "What- WHAT?!" the same way that Shaxx did.
---
How much does it weigh, and what material is it made out of.
---
anything with outlaw kill clip is always ridiculous
---
6 pounds and 3D printed.
---
I mean he is pretty bad
---
Or misadventures
---
Pc or console?
---
How did you get the Dreaming City lore entries? I feel like I never get any.
---
now im sad, that's my main ship and now it won't be rare anymore :( damnit tess...
---
Weird. That sucks.
---
Thanks.
---
There is iron banner!
---
I KNOW MAN LAST THRONE I BEAT VORGETH AND WAS STILL KICKING AND I DIED FROM A PHALAX PUSHING ME OFF THE MAP ON MY WAY TO INCARU
---
what power are you?
---
Rat King might redeem it.
---
700
---
I always forget about that
---
I still get some stuff from previous seasons in current engrams. I just pulled a launch emote the other night. So i think its possible but theres a stupid low chance for it to happen.
---
Most of the time, Rat King is tragically forgettable.
---
Bummer about that. $20 is a "Sure why not" purchase but when it bumps up to over $30 after tax and shipping I'm like "yeah I don't really need that"
---
I‚Äôve done raids with it, it is definitely one of the most fun guns if all six people use it
---
I was here back in CoO and never got it due to the corruption of Eververse loot drops.
---
r/titlegore
---
Matchmaker, this is TowerControl.  We've got another five streaker feeling good, have you got that four stack of Unbrokens queued up?
---
TowerControl, this is Matchmaker.  Yup, primed and ready for the beatdown.
---
Roger that Matchmaker, fire when ready.
---
I meant more for comp. Remaking in comp should be a thing and is so game deciding
---
Not necessarily. The dlc is good and I would definitely consider it worth the cost, but you definitely don‚Äôt *need* to get it.
---
Last Word is a true Hunter‚Äôs weapon always was always will be
---
Best jump
---
Both Strange Terrain and The Corrupted, nice
---
It can two tap tho? I have Luna's, and I swore I two tapped a few people outta nowhere like back to back every other kill or so.
---
It would have only been worth 1 point per kill out of the 500 you need. That quest was suuuuuch a grind. My kindle put in overtime.
---
LMAO. I‚Äôm a warlock main and this is exactly what imma do. Or maybe getaways and infinite arc soul + nades
---
Do both, oh yea. While you're at it, might as well just activate iron burden, because you're gonna get annihalated by the skip grenades anyway
---
Looks like u have the tonic buff but for dawnblade swords lol
---
Crucible where everyone hates each other
---
Yeah but the damage reduction (that I inflict) drives me fucking nuts, and I‚Äôm never gonna get that 500 iron burden kills or whatever for the garbage fusion so idc. Erentil will be better anyway
---
The architects are the most OP bosses in the game! I don't know a single guardian that has faced them and lived...
---
That made me laugh
---
That's pretty messed up. You shouldn't be able to get matched against people in legend at all, unless they people you're playing with are legends.
---
Listen man I‚Äôm well aware of the RNG barrier, it‚Äôs the whole scope of the game. I could be you right now, bitching about how it took me well over 100 chests to get 1000 voices, but that‚Äôs the game. This is a PVE game with some PVP on the side, that‚Äôs how it has been for a long time. Space wizards man, space wizards.
---
And tell me, how easy is it to get said medals when there's only 4 opponents?
---
Oooo is that the armour set from Sloane?
---
Yeah. It was kinda stupid.
---
You can at best 2 man many encounters in the d2 raids but otherwise no, there aren't any full raids you can solo
---
scrubs be scrubbin!
---
The game starts fun, then after a short time you realise there really isnt any point to anything you do. Your power is always capped so light level is meaningless if you're above it, but god forgive if you're a few below bc everything will destroy you. The devs have 0 creativity so everything is just stale af and there is 0 end game at all
---
Powerful.
---
Not on ps4 you aint
---
Not really.. Whats not fair is spec blades that can wipe a team twice, sentinel shields that can wipe 3 - 4 people with 1 throw... The list goes on
---
The hardcore feel of PvE makes Destiny, to me, feel more like an MMO than before, so I like that.
---
Thank you very much!
---
I'm trying to post more around here for you guys :) I don't post as often as I should. And thanks!
---
I completely forgot that going to shuro is more efficient for farming kills than leviathan, since you can put a raid banner and such
---
Why are u so perfect? Can I use this for wallpaper? Why am I asking such questions? I don't have time to explain what I don't have time to explain.
---
They probably won't lmao they've featured a bunch of my stuff in the past and they probably want a wider variety of artists. I'm glad you like it though! :)
---
Pics or lies. Jk, I believe you. I saw a Chronicler earlier in DC today. I finally unlocked Cursebreaker myself, and I'm focusing on getting those last 5 lore books done for the Chronicler seal myself. It's definitely a hard one to get and I would be honored to have it. Wayfarer is going to get dusty on my shelf.
---
I'm very glad to hear that my work is enjoyed :)
---
Imagine needing cooperation to finish an objective in a team based raid
---
Who would have thought
---
This one's been on the list since we started talking about the rat.
---
I did it with top tree arc strider, arc bolt grenade and the grenade tonic. 
---
My weapon loadout was Pulse Rifle, Retold Tale and Tractor Cannon
---
Then at the final ‚Äústage‚Äù I swapped TC for 1k Voices. 
---
Strats are to throw lots of grenades (definitely helps to have Ashes to Assets headgear), dodge, melee something, dodge, melee, dodge, melee, dodge, super? Destroy everything (but focus on the yellow bar enemies)
---
I also swapped Lucky Raspberry to Raiden Flux for when I used my super. 
---
PC if that matters.
