Might consider pulling tricksleeves from collections for the vanguard pinnacle grind
---
---
---
Sorry about that, I took a pretty long break from the game. I never played season 8.
---
Yupp
---

---
This? This doesn't seem like that throw required skill.
---
Except they do
---
I mean I just want to point out no one had an issue with the Arbalest or any LFR before this season
---
Honestly Martyr's is SO MUCH FUN 
---
#i love it
---
never played season 8, unfortunately :(
---
That‚Äôs buzzard right? Haven‚Äôt seen the pinnacle requirements yet, nor have I come across it in PvP
---
I‚Äôm completely the opposite. Been getting record (for me) kills and having a blast. Not using arbelest, either. I think the buff to sidearms has really gelled with my play style. Don‚Äôt worry, the spam will quiet down soon enough as everyone finishes their Komodo quest. Until then just stay out of lanes!
---
Current pvp is similar to an arbalest only version of momentum control.
---
I think the variks one is way worse
---
Bloody Mara....hehehehe
---
*RATED T FOR TEEN*
---
Yes a super aka the golden gun. If it was just a straight up gun fight it might of been another story...... Oh I just had a  thought what If the dredgen brought back yur using the sundil.
---
He's had centuries to practice his headbutting, just look at that wraparound move he pulled coming out of the Forest. If there wasn't an Eliksni phrase for "say syke right now," there will be after some Fallen see that footage.
---
Yes, but it‚Äôs much higher risk. Titans get killed from shotguns while trying to shoulder charge all the freaking time
---
Thank you for sharing your wisdom
---
I remember someone made one on xbox that said UCK BUNGIE with that emblem lol
---
Underrated comment
---
It's exactly the same as it has been besides adding a LFR quest. This is exactly what happened with revoker, it has nothing to do with being out of balance.
---
YEEEEEEEESSSSSSSS!!!!!
---
Ran it 3 times earlier, only completed once. It seemed like I was the only one throwing the charges. And my teammates were barely doing any damage to the boss.
---
Only had a full team of 3 the one time I completed. Other two runs someone left as soon as it started, and it never filled the spot with another player.
---
Maybe its new light players that just dont get how to play the game mode? And a longer timer at the end would give people more time to quit before loading into another run.
---
I've always found that forge to be harder than most of the others though too so its probably a combination of all the above.
---
This is the way
---
One of my favorite loadouts is mountaintop, fighting lion, and a heavy GL with spike nades
---
Also: Me when I kill 1,800 dregs and put the Ether  into cookies. Mmmmm.
---
You mean in a shaxx accent... Shaxxent?
---
Fuck he hit a bill
---
Yes, that's right, it's the buzzard. Kinda interested in its ability to change energy
---
Honestly, if they somehow did it live. Probably a way to have captions/subtitles. Or if they added to it post production. Would probably open up to a much more larger target since either they can't hear, or are in a situation where they can't use sound. ( Not sure if such a thing is available since I don't watch streamers )
---
Fair enough, that is one way to look at it
---
Hmmmm I'll definitely look into it.
---
More importantly, why is this expressed in an image riddled with spelling errors?
---
Now this is pod racing.

Underrated
---
I see no reason to pick only one. Both of them sitting in the announcer box would be amazing. Having Shaxx and Saint-14 comment on your use if a super would be fantastic.
---
Game's been bugged to reset video settings every time you open it. Most of us aren't crashing from it, but it's not just you.
---
Solo Q for competitive is like a coin flip where each flip takes 15 minutes and you have to focus all of your attention on the coin the entire time.
---
This hurt more and more with every death
---
Shaxx be like... Did you get all the grades?! Ask youself?!'
---
But where do you give them to him
---
I can help you if you want I'm a PC player
---
And hunters complain about shoulder charging...
---
I‚Äôve looked all through my quests.
---
Just because everyone one is using it doesn't mean it's broken. The hit box is generous but that's because it's a charge sniper and takes time to line up.
---
This is like asking snipers to be nerfed because the headshot too well.
---
Updated the info, Thank you (‚ó†‚Äø‚ó†)
---
I found out. I think that Gambit prime is best. I was in a match and got tons of ingredients.
---
I loved this show
---
More of a rail gun it just shoots thrue enemy's
---
Huh?
---
Oh shit really? Didn‚Äôt know that, I thought it just had to be me, damn. 
---
Well, thanks for the answer mate
---
do i see a snitch on the field
---
Well my top 5 is
---
Saint 14
---
Armamentarium
---
Peregrine Greaves
---
Lion rampant
---
Action war rig (when I want to have fun)
---
Lol. I will try this out. Just got the catalyst. Not new light but didn‚Äôt think swords were any good.
---
I‚Äôve run it a bunch this season and last with no issues; if you‚Äôre on XBox let me know and I‚Äôll help you out with it if you still need it.
---
Yes but mine gets blue and it's a bungie thing. That season of dawn pass messed things up pretty bad.
---
I just got that today.
---
So I recently had a weird thing where having vsync on would drop me to like 20 fps. Turned it off and went back up into the 100s. Maybe try that.
---
Agreed.  I didn‚Äôt like Prime until I logged some hours, now I much prefer it.
---
Nice to know its not my PS4 or anything. Bungie be giving me a minor heart attack
---
Jesus christ
---
Damn right he is
---
Only primary at the cost of one shoting enemies. Less dmg.
---
where are the speed runners? they should be on the mountain getting ready to boost off of it with a worldline followed by holding a middle tree sunsinger nade.
---
üòÇ true
---
Unlimiteeeed poweeeerrrrr ‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è
---
Link?
---
Im new to hunters way whats swipe?  Never heard it before
---
He also didn‚Äôt have a weapon it was just him and his bubble
---
I have four pieces of it. Too bad they never updated it to 2.0.
---
I main ace/beloved so the LFR aren't a big deal. I've got an instant headshot weapon with snapshot compared to a charging rifle.
---
Don't hangout in the lanes and it shouldn't be an issue. Push tight spots with a shotgun or smg to close the gap between you and the LFR user.
---
*coughs in Last Wish*
---
yeah, unfortunately... the new exotic is a perfect example of what could have been. Symmetry stacks its perk up, doesn't go away when stowed, and the timer for its perk doesn't start until you start shooting
---
CALL THE SPEAKER!
---
Bungie: We know you didnt like Arc Battery so how about Void battery
---
Warlocks: *laughs in handheld supernova*
---
Haha lmao. This is the second or third game that did a patch and shit got bad like this. Come to think of it I think anthem was the one that made a patch and it somehow almost friend players console. Randomly shutting down like power got cut etc some had to do a clean ps system install cause drive got corrupted. 
---
Let's hope bungie didnt mess up that bad. But I'm hoping for a fix soon. It does get annoying
---
$90 with code
---
Yep not for me someone might want it lol
---
Nothing more satisfying then lobbing a long shot off a wall down a hallway and bonking your target
---
In what sense?
---
No one can get exp for you.
---
Just do bounties, go to each and every tower or planetary and do bounties. If you‚Äôre done with bounties then try grinding crucible
---
R you all asshats
---
Didn't they feed of ether? Why would they eat humans?
---
Holy crap I forgot about mxc
---
I‚Äôm sure that 10 glimmer won‚Äôt be missed
---
Let's not pretend like most Warlocks wanna wear this either
---
What annoys me the most in Gambit is when my team summons a primeval, while the other teams bank has drained to 0. But since no one on my team helps to take care of the blockers they just pile up, so by the time the enemy team summons their primeval we still have 4 large blockers around to make sure there's no way in hell to win. 
---
I'm almost starting to think it's a better strategy to let the other team summon their primeval first so we can stack blockers on their side and not have to worry about the blocker build up.
---
In my neighborhood we call them laces ‚Äúchoked up‚Äù
---
Wait it doesn‚Äôt need to be equipped?
---
Why do people do this to themselves? If you are not having fun, you are not playing right.
---
Thats not really news as it just states the same 3 ways to get bright dust when the only real viable way to get it is the weekies. The Seasonal bright dust rewards is only a few hundred which doesn't get you much. Lastly repeatable bounties take far too long and aren't really worth the glimmer cost of 3k a pop.
---
"accidentally"
---
I was referring to the unintended feature where it could stagger unstoppables. It was a fun feature for the exotic and I think they shoulda just left it in.
---
While it's true that clips and stats don't provide evidence, they provide a overall picture of a player. A player with a average K/D of 0.4 getting banned for "advanced cheating suites" (on **his account specifically**, not the team) after playing comp (second example in the post) for example paints one that doesn't make sense.
---
People get banned for false-positives, or processes that interact with the game (antivirus, cheat protection of other games, cleaner tools and several more) in literally every single game. I'm a developer myself and you can easily view evidence of this by googling "false positives ban gaming", which results in a list of pretty much every single worthy to mention developer/publisher having issues with this.
---
Even bungie [had issues with this](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-10-25-bungie-insists-its-not-banning-destiny-2-pc-players-for-using-third-party-applications) (and unbanned people because of it) in the past, they even tried to deny it in the beginning.
---
A "we don't talk about it, you are screwed" policy doesn't remove the issue, it hides it.
---
Tex mechanica isn‚Äôt really too popular with the crucible/vanguard (especially crucible), so seeing it on a prominent character in the tower is interesting.
---
Saint-14 is Destiny‚Äôs Doomguy.
---
Oh fair. I‚Äôve seen it shred in gambit and the crucible so I thought that‚Äôs what you meant.
---
Can agree, gambit prime is more enjoyable and oddly less of a stress headache. Plus it's one and done.
---
COME ON!!! HIT ME!!!!
---
as an arc titan main, i can confirm there is very minor tracking. i get fucked over when i aim just a little bit to the left or right and i only graze my opponent's shoulders and bam thats donzo for me, Arbalest or Wolves to the face. But i have the exotic Dunemarchers that make it much easier for me to turn and make adjustments. Now i just get killed by Arbalests.
---
Yeah...
---
*Laughs in zero hour heroic*
---
Yeah I'm just questioning why do they eat them, if they feed of ether?
---
They don't need the protein from our meat. tf
---
I'm carrying a Conquerer 2 around because I've been disappointed by every other kinetic smg I have.
---
It is, but it should‚Äôve been the Psion‚Äôs instead since those are the ‚Äúsmart‚Äù guys who are actually meddling with the sundial
---
What is 2 for 100 alex
---
Yeah, exactly. Dialogue about gruesome things are fine for T-rated games. Look at Ace Combat, there‚Äôs radio chatter in that describe scenes that would otherwise place the game at a solid M, or even an A if they showed children.
---
Tbh, Bungie has been faulted more for *not banning enough* than for issuing to baby or unreasonable bans.
---
I‚Äôve seen video after video of clear as day cheating and hacking posted to YouTube and reported to Bungie.  Those players are still playing.  In one particular case, Clay_is_clutch, Bungie only gave him a temporary ban and he‚Äôs back in the game doing it again.
---
So you‚Äôll pardon the community‚Äôs skepticism that Bungie handed out a totally undeserving *permanent* ban by mistake.
---
I don‚Äôt know what it would take to *prove* your buddy didn‚Äôt cheat, but what you provide is circumstantial evidence at best.
---
You could argue that it‚Äôs impossible to prove a negative, to prove that he *didnt* do something.  But as of now, he‚Äôs been convicted, and at that point the onus is on him to prove innocence.
---
Meanwhile we came in a squad of nine and got picked off one by one.
---
I got like one and a tail.
---
Bro with pre nerf QB you could shoot near someone‚Äôs feet and you‚Äôd still get precision kill, it was literally more obnoxious than sleeper imo, the magnetism from double aim assist basically gave you aimbot with the right scope on.
---
Enough to make a grown man cry
---
That new secret quest really wants me to kill space mom so badly, fuck her.
---
I N D E E D
---
Yeeted.
---
Never tried out the hunter. Don‚Äôt really know why.
---
I never noticed that weapon in previous years, but i didn't play for almost a year. Is it newish? Coz I sure notice it nowadays, lol. Good grief. Not even a Titan. I just need to train my reflexes to GTFO when i see that yellow light....
---
But that doesn't mean he won't ever be bought back. There could always be new lore in Destiny's 10 year plan that brings back Cayde for whatever reason. My bet is Cayde faked his death.
---
Not saying they will bring him back, just that the wet blankets going 'TIME IS ONLY BROKEN ON MERCURY' are wrong because that's not the only way Cayde could be revived. The fact that Bungie bought back a dead character means they can do it again.
---
the worst part was meeting up with randos of different classes, I was not in a clan at the time and was strictly a solo player but damn was it a good quest.
---
Corners are a thing. Trying to cap a zone is a thing. 99% of my deaths to 1-shot titans is one of those two scenarios. No time to run. *Not even time to scream \*cue ominous music\**
---
Sadly no. That is just the icons loading in. You can do the same thing at every map waypoint.
---
Wait what would be the point of cross-play then?
---
Strike bosses or heroic public event bosses. Prob menagerie and sundial work too
---
Clearly someone at Bungie is a fan of the Culture novels and this is a Knife Missile. Because that thing has a Mind of its own.
---
No one is saying you shouldn't have a OHK.
---
People are saying that it shouldn't be tracking/chasing them down like people are wearing giant magnets in their head
---
And come on now, it's not hard to counter a shoulder charge if you see it coming, and if you didn't see it coming, chances are that you were going to die there regardless
---
Ah I see
---
Siiiiick
---
Yes, the season pass isnt just the battle pass reward thing it's all of the content too - you needed it last season as well, you just got it for free if you bought shadowkeep
---
Warlock main here. I'd like to introduce you to Slova Bomb :D
---
Never got 4 in one shot, but I have seen targets drag the damn thing to at least one teammate, sometimes two. I can only assume they think they can outrun it 'til it fizzles.
---
\^ I'm with Fed
---
WHAT?! WHAT?! HOW?!
---
The house of light works with humans, it's how we got Intel for zero hour
---
Ok, that knife tracking made me gasp a nearly audible "wat." but I'm more interested to know what platform you're on. Your strafe seems oddly choppy. Are you using a controller or mouse+keyboard?
---
I‚Äôve tried so many times and I just need to get into the thing to complete the quest, just, ah, it‚Äôs so unsatisfying
---
O ok, thanks mate
---
They were joking! S14 is a murderer!
---
You get an upvote for the term ‚Äúdookie spawns‚Äù
---
Bottom Tree Sentinel + MK44 cuz you can shieldbash the crap out of those skinny ass Hunters while they try to run away like they love to do then you get 50% of your melee back so you can shieldbash the shit out of those Warlocks with they fake ass wedding dress withing the next 20 seconds and that my man, is priceless...
---
Zero Hour.
---
Honestly, zooming up to the team without being spotted and getting at least two of them before the timer yoinks you out is super satisfying. I mean sniping them from long range only works if the other team is being dumb and not going to cover when they hear the Invader alarm.
---
Replace it Zenophage and you‚Äôve got my invasion weapon. Rarely do I ever not 4k with Xenophage
---
Really? Oo ok that makes sense. You don‚Äôt lose the streak anymore ok gambit right?
---
Nice clutch win. I hope you ended up winning the entire match.
---
Oo that makes a lot of sense, thanks man. Do killing invaders still count? Do kills from your teammates count?
---
The Last Word
---
I‚Äôve completely logged out and back in and it still didn‚Äôt work
---
Was just going to say that every time I see the opposing team in the gambit derelict, I see giant wishenders on their backs.
---
Ever since I first played destiny 1 crucible and even up to now, this pvp has always felt like something that they just added in for the sake of having a pvp. Like they just took the base game, whipped up some maps and then put spawn points and called it a day. 
---
And it seems they only "balance" things when people complain enough.
---
Cayde-6 was against getting revived though, right?
---
*cough* chasm of screams *cough*
---
I just wish they would make more Warlock ROBES and not dresses. The high minded complex chest piece and the ankaa seeker chest pieces are my favorite because they make my warlock look like a wise space wizard from the college of winterhold and not a pretty 16 year old girl in a prom dress. The thing i hate most about warlock armor is that they just wont make any without an obscenely tall collar.
---
2 tru
---
Please upload of video of you using dodge. I only play as a hunter and you telling me that hunters can easily dodge a shoulder feels like ypur lying to me. I would love nothing more than to dodge a shoulder charge, as if I haven't tried for YEARS.
---
Simple build to farm Hush but still DPS good: Izanagi, Arsenic Bite with Archer's Tempo, Line in the Sand with Rapid Hit and Firing Line.
---
What about the solo pvp generics?
---
They are godly
---
I‚Äôm guessing you meant to do that?
---
He's too busy filling job applications since the whole fanbase is gonna want to replace him with Saint XIV.
---
No way in hell I would ever consider playing such a weak class...
---
It also gives armor that you don‚Äôt have
---
Ennead Emblem, **Collections/flair/open world** It‚Äôs the *Mind your manners* Triumph needs completion
---
Run it with bottom tree sunbreaker. No one will ever expect the 4 taping invisible titan.
---
Ricochet rounds off the nutsack to the face.
---
I agree to an extent.  The problem with golden gun is its long range hitscan nature (point and click adventure?). Hammers have travel time creating a weakness with distant and airborne enemies.  Nova warp has a charge time and slow movement, forcing a "close-the-gap creatively" or "wait around the corner like you have a sword" type of gameplay in most situations.  From what I've seen (personal and non-personal), golden gun is a ohk hitscan tool in which reaction time and Target tracking plays a large factor in the success of that super.  Giving it slight armor could allow you to survive a few more primary shots and maybe some shotgun hits but... If the reaction time on that super is decent, multiple kills should be more common place.  I really foresee deaths from golden guns coming from Snipes, getting baited to a firing squad, shotgun, etc... I actually think the roaming time for golden gun should be the focus.  When rushed to get x amount of kills with a seemingly short timer... It may convince some users to make riskier plays.  To lengthen the timer would allow a golden gun user less stress and lead to more meaningful and methodical pushes into engagements.  I believe tacking on more armor would create a new subset of unforeseen issues.
---
id go for stability mw tho
---
No because we don't have a bunch of sheep following our every move. The streamer you are referring to is literally the asmongold of destiny lol. Bunch of brain dead sheep jumping when he says to
---
I always wish you could go back to those mountains at any point in time just to see the view  this is the reason why I love the red wars first 2 missions
---
üëç
---
Do they have Ana Bray and/or Petra Venj?
---
Asking for a friend.
---
Oho, you dare approach me?
---
Most tattoos suck, this one however, absolutely does NOT
---
His Ghost probably takes care of that (like Drifter's offered to and was ignored), or he's figured out the Kakashi trick of Blinking small chunks of things into his mouth.
---
Looking for some people to play with, any console is fine I have all, just always wanted to get into the game
---
The new season is about a titan who was mentioned in D1 and D2 lore so everyone is talking about him because we can meet him now
---
It's an awesome gun. If you've been playing long enough to have most exotics, go get fated engrams from xur this weekend. Thats how I got it
---
Just putting my comment here because I also want to know 
---
Because Right now is ¬£40 and I don‚Äôt like that to much because I‚Äôm a bit stingy
---
Nope, as long as you hit Legend once this season, (5500) then it will trigger after your 300 Lunas kills. Actually I had to log out and log back in for mine to pop, but yeah. Congrats! Enjoy those crispy 3-taps :)
---
Murder Death Kill is what I'll choose if given the opportunity lol. "Your light fades away"...
---
Harder to hit isn‚Äôt saying much. Handhelds are borderline irrelevant without contraverse hold and shoulder charge is without skull fort. See the pattern? Both require exotics to be somewhat annoying. But knives? Nah you get it back for free on kills. You can‚Äôt really compare the two either. Handheld is more like a pocket shotty and shoulder charge is melee range based. The knife is a pocket sniper with about as much magnetism and aim assist. I‚Äôd say either remove the refresh on kill part or make the windup wayyyyyy. longer.  Like devour levels of windup. Or require and exotic to achieve what it can do now. Hunters have it so easy compared to titans and especially warlocks in pvp. It‚Äôs not a surprise that out of all the one hit abilities the hunter has the best one.
---
Lol but that requires luck to bounce it. No one does that anyways. If you use it at mid and long ranges like I do it absolutely does take time to aim it to account for travel time. It certainly takes more skill even if not by much than the other two OHKs
---
\*Chuckles in Arc Warlock Ult\*  
---
~~I'm~~ you're in danger!
---
Titan main here wonders why we're not eating crayons?
---
Damn hits too close to home. I just play alone now I literally have zero friends that okay this game. And yes I am having fun throwing this pity party
---
When you get triple tap, you get the 4th bullet free! Lol
---
Yeah it was a warlock exotic
---
*shout with shot, sorry
---
You get lick 30% damage resistance and can blink all in the same subclass, you'll be alright
---
Actually I hit the glimmer cap, all I get is 3 [**insert destination material **].
---
Huh yeah i never saw it looks intresting tho
---
I don‚Äôt even touch that reddit
---
I heard it‚Äôs bad so I‚Äôm just going to ignore it 
---
Man I need to step up my dawning grind but my commitments are fucking annoying
---
Truer words have never been spoken. It's like there are 3 sides of the coin in comp and 2 of them cause you to lose.
---
I visit him sometimes \*teary eyes\*
---
If you finished the 2nd mission, Bungie sent you a coupon code for the replica helmet and pin...congratulating us on completing the S9 campaign. So, no, doesn‚Äôt look like more missions are coming. Bummer.
---
Their opinoin means as much as anyone else who has as many hours in that specific part of the game as they do, Cammy has thousands upon thousands of hours in crucible and therefore has much more experience and knowledge than someone like myself (a crucible player who has played predominantly crucible since day one destiny 2) I think something like this should be taken into account when developing the game, as stated in the video it is  either balance or power fantasy not both.
---
I thought it didn't work cause I didn't complete the quest step, but I also had the same problem with the other new obelisk.
---
This is the kind of content I signed up for take a upvote

---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, a lot of the complaints are valid, but in my personal experience I actually like the game as a whole and don‚Äôt have a lot of problems with it so I‚Äôm not really here for the negativity I guess. That sub does have people who post positive stuff like an achievement they got or something cool that happened in the community or thanking bungie but a lot of the time at least half of the stuff is negative and when the game is in a bad spot (curse of Osiris) it‚Äôs just constant negativity. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm glad I found other subs like lowsodiumdestiny, destinymemes, hudlessdestiny, and of course destiny2
---
*Casts nova bomb instead*
---
You have the 3 class stats(Mobility, Resilience, Recovery). They increase movement, HP/Shields, and HP Recovery, respectively. They also decrease Class Ability Cooldown for Hunter(dodge), Titan(barrier), and Warlock(rift) respectively.
---
Then you have Discipline, Intellect and Strength, which decrease your Grenade, Super, and Melee cooldowns, respectively.
---
These go up by a tier for every 10 in each stat you have. i.e. there is no benefit in having Discipline at 88 instead of 80
---
1.4 million views says otherwise . More interesting than alot of movies now days
---
I think you can pick one up while frosted though.
---
Wait until summer is over then the skin will be white ahah

Everyone: "That's a pretty tattoo you got the- AHHHH MY EYES ITS SO BRIGHT "

That was the first weapon I masterworks

You can yell with your helmet on, but not with your mouth full because that would be rude.
---
The Titans only defense is the shoulder charge with tier 9 mobility+mida+mida mini+mk.44 stand asides
---
Can we mark as spoilers?! I haven't done it yet.
---
Thanks lol

Servers are down
---
Not sure, but I did spot Holiday at different local Hot Topics.
---
may send u an exotic weapon lool
---
We were a team of blueberries and I was using my bow to kills the taken bois. I used MT on the boss when no ads were around but the blueberry was freaking out because I was still using a bow. Also you would gain infamy faster in prime than in normal gambit
---
Have you tried r/destinylfg
---
It wasn't easy. I've found her at a box lunch store at my mall.
---
They actually nerfed golden gun so it can't one shot past 40 meters
---
Based on the photo, probably dusklight shards.
---
I'm having a bit of a hard time with destiny's gear. Why is this such a good weapon?
---
Eris morn be like
---
My first one dropped Masterworked already.  RNG good.
---
Unfortunately not. As another redditor mentioned, they removed the exotic rewards :(
---
Public event on mercury gives 10 due to two chests at end. All other pubs give you 5.

Lets burn those edge transits to a crisp

The end boss of the Siva raid was female.

That is what I payed monies for. Sadly this is no bug giving an advantage to players, that shit would have been fixed asap

If you emote with chilled to the bone youll glow

Having a tough time so far this season.  Stuck around 3800.  Damn sweats...

If only Sentinel super had that murder seeking tracking

Just to prolong gameplay.

Awesome bro.

he's not the only one, i can tell you that...
---
Top tree nova bomb has prepared me for this moment
---
Also Eriana‚Äôs catalyst doesn‚Äôt have to be equipped anymore, either. sadly I made 1% progress on it last season before giving up so it‚Äôs going a low slower without the season pass boosts but at least it‚Äôs progressing.
---
The bug is still present for me, huh - all the setting still are reset to default high whenever i relaunch the game. The fix is working though, so big thanks to the author!
---
#THE HELMET...
---
Sorry but tbh I really liked this expansion
---
Ill definitely apply for it
---
Clans make IT easy to find fellow guardians. Go to the clan page in Wiki, there are many who are looking for new members
---
i want that too but i think it would be too op in some situations. i want shaders on exotic weapons tho.

How is that a fair comparison when its a special set of white gear you start the game with? Its not a random set of white gear
---
Less pockets and pouches would also be a good start tbh
---
It is happening though, can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs boss-specific or just the end not triggering sometimes
---
The more shots you have the less often your out of the fight, I do plenty fine with Ace even at 5500 and once again that was one example. Dragonfly does plenty in PvP as it forces separation in players. Don't want to get caught for a 100 damage explosion don't hold hands it has plenty value
---
Unstoppable Ogre because you can chain stagger them 
---
The barrier fuckos on the other hand can be staggered far less and the barrier fuckos from the zhan nightfall (I would use the currant one but I can‚Äôt because i don‚Äôt have shadowkeep) 
---
Were a fucking pain in the penis to deal with
---
What did you gift?
---
Always knew Warlocks were the big gay 
---
This is why I play Titan
---
Be sure to update for the reason(s) as to why you got banned.
---
Weird. The only fix I can think of is try to beat it with a higher score so it doesn't go down all the way. Hopefully they'll fix it
---
How many crayons did you eat?
---
Just stick with your team and don‚Äôt over commit. You only need shots on people, someone else can clutch the kill. Avg 5 kills a game and you have it in 5.
---
I honestly can't remember, though watching their character flinch that hard from getting shot while teabagging before I respawbed made me laugh enough to not care much haha.
---
None, I'm not a Titan
---
Well that explains it
---
If only they sent me an email with the reasons, this is all I can think of write now since I have only been playing for 30 hours and have never done something like this before. Just a question though, if I were to quit a match and then migrate the account to steam would the infraction of that original match quit carry over, while I can‚Äôt specifically remember doing that it was quite a while between me migrating to steam and playing destiny 2
---
Apex Legends puts a smile on your face? 
---
/s
---
Ah a Hunter then? 
---
Tbh though majority of robes I seem to be getting (Ornament or otherwise) look more like trench coats
---
Okay thanks die the explanation!
---
I don‚Äôt even remember doing that but I play crucible casually every week for bounties and XP anyway so I guess it didn‚Äôt stand out to me.
---
I put about 4k hours into wf the game becomes stale there is literally no endgame in it would spend most of my time decorating the dojo and farming plat. switching to d2 end of 2018 was my best choice Instantly uninstalled wf after that.
---
Too busy dealing with the FWC device to worry about dress normalities. Also a lot of those robes are open.
---
:c
---
I am staying away from PvP like the devil from holy water. I am raging way too fast and in my age that is not good for me anymore ;-)
---
Bruh, like a post said, go into Scorched, even people who suck at it could easily rack up 20 kills, you just need to be more maneuverable than others.
---
Warlock main, although it's an Awoken Female. 
---
And tbh I do prefer the trenchcoat look over robes. Favourite being the comormorant blade set. Makes me wish there was a gunblade exotic sword, thatd be the closest thing to a Final Fantasy Protagonist
---
We know there's no endgame, but we still get new content periodically, so as someone who "finished" the game it's good if you log in every few months and do the new stuff, then go back to destiny
---
Mithrax is one of my favorite characters in Destiny overall. Wish we got more to do with him...
---
&gt; you just need to be more maneuverable than others 
---
The first of my problems, followed by my inability to aim :-D
---
I don't know anything for certain but I do have thoughts. I would assume it is account based so it wouldn't matter if you have cross-saved onto PC. Bans &amp; strikes should follow. 
---
Also is your Gamertag/username the same as your Reddit username? Someone might have reported that for whatever reason.
---
I feel playing control is fun because even if i suck a little when it comes to gunfights having other objectives helps me be useful. Also I learned to just follow my teammates and work together. Combined fire is a must and learning to use cover has helped my overall game. I just couldn‚Äôt resist going after guns like Recluse and Randy‚Äôs so I forced myself. The funny thing is, I‚Äôve noticed with age I am more mellow than I was in my teens and twenties and since I know I suck I don‚Äôt get that upset.
---
So this initially happened to me, but when I just reloaded on the spawn point it worked. I wonder why it‚Äôs so inconsistent?
---
...and yet, to the best of my knowledge, he‚Äôs the only known multi-class npc guardian. Knows more about the Taken than any other Risen, including Asher. Drifter ¬´¬†knows how things really work and he‚Äôs showing us through Gambit. Which he created.
---
Of course I‚Äôm gonna take his side first, my username checks out after all. I love Gambit. I‚Äôll put my emotions aside now, though. I‚Äôm sure you see him as Jesse for a reason I did not foresee :D
---
Thanks :D
---
Thanks, finally a good answer. I need to bake a pie for christmas
---
Shotgun and shader?
---
The limit does not exist
---
Any news on this? would like to know too!
---
How‚Äôs this relevant to you?
---
I just want to be able to use all acquired armor as an ornament
---
That and make infusing the same armor piece only cost glimmer like it does weapons
---
Looks pretty good
---
On a post about how people don't have anyone to play with, what part of that is confusing?
---
How do you bake the cookies?
---
Ok I will thanks
---
Ah right, yeah it should just be universal ornament

I have made a duscord server for lone destiny 2 players like us if you want to join here is the link btw it contains overwatch and tf2 aswell https://discord.gg

Well, shrouded Rebels itself is Just fun to Play with. I know the guys pretty well for only 3 weeks. And Just because the community is bigger doesn't mean your Clan in it can't be personal
---
Glorious
---
Bottom tree striker, mountaintop, handheld supernova that kind of thing
---
Some of it is stereotyped because of in-game lore. It doesn't work, just punch it until it does. Warlocks get called gay too &amp; Hunters have throwing knives that OHKO people. 
---
To sum it up;
---
Titan's - gay &amp; stupid (stereotype)
---
Warlocks - gay &amp; nerds (stereotype)
---
Hunters - gay &amp; loner (stereotype)
---
It's all good. I got a bunch of downvotes one time because my phone autocorrected Cayde.
---
Okok. Thanks
---
And OEM never hurt...the user
---
Could I get an exotic hand cannon in base game please?
---
Too poor for dlc.
---
Whenever I walk into that lightning bolt grenade I just die, idk if other people have the experience but that‚Äôs mine. So let‚Äôs change it to ‚Äúan extremely powerful‚Äù grenade
---
Ok. I was thinking ‚Äúthose look just like army jungle boots with the cloth replaced.‚Äù
---
/r/razer may not like this
---
Hey, Sloane‚Äôs cool
---
What did it autocorrect to?
---
Just keep opening the map and fast traveling to the spot right next to it. It's a bug where if any other Guardian in the area hasn't fully unlocked the obelisk, nobody in that instance can use it. It normally takes me like 5 tries (about 30 seconds to 45 seconds ) to get an instance that works. It's annoying, but people saying it takes 5 MINUTES or some shit are seriously exaggerating.
---
In my experience it does, but we are all different.
---
It's a hard pass for me, but thank you for the suggestion.
---
It's still bothering me how we can save Saint but can't do the same thing to save Cayde
---
The way I looked at it is that she does time travel, but she was unsure if we would meet again at the end of D1. 
---
This means no matter how much time she had traveled through, she had never ran back into us as of that moment.
---
For this reason my Exo Titan (D1 main) waits patiently for his lost love to return.
---
He didn‚Äôt get a chance to do the horizontal mambo with her then...
---
He will not miss the chance again..
---
He took my job!
---
well, they did lose an eye...
---
r/Destiny2Fireteams
---
I‚Äôll join! If you‚Äôre still looking for peeps
---
There are quite a few characters whose stories are sort of unexplored in the current lore.
---
Another notable example being the revived Uldren Sov who is now a guardian and lives in the Tangled Shore somewhere due to everyone ostracizing him for killing Cayde in his past life.
---
\^This. 
---
Also, there is a really BIG burning gong on the upper deck with a well-mannered gentlemen in heavy armour speaking words of wisdom in front of it.
---
To be honest I don‚Äôt like it. I am not saying it is a bad weapon because it isn‚Äôt. I just don‚Äôt like the way it feels.
---
Crota on the Sofa
---
Dude when he came out of the forest it was dope asf then he went and head butted the Minotaur and that part fucked the cut scene it just ruined it
---
This gun worked *so well* with self-res Sunsinger. Now that it's been replaced by Dawnblade, this gun would be better used in D2 by a Sunbreaker Titan using Hallowfire Heart.
---
I was trying to be nice at first because normally I don‚Äôt like people that generalize and hate other subclasses, but then you or some other salty hunter here decided to downvote me. I don‚Äôt care about getting downvoted, but normally anyone that complains about other subclasses or broken exotics are just a** at crucible and need an excuse to justify why they are so bad. No matter how many changes and nerfs to certain abilities happen they will suck and continue to suck until they stop complaining and actually start trying.
---
r/fireteams or destiny companion app
---
as a note it works aswell when u use worldline skate
---
Everything is gey. Ok. Maybe I've just been ignorant but I haven't seen Warlocks getting called gay, same thing with bullying hunters or complaining about OHKO throwing knives. Thanks for the opinion though.
---
And then all of them downvote you because they are like a hive mind seeking out any insults against them. Go ahead, downvote me. It won‚Äôt improve your gameplay whatsoever.
---
That is only stage 1. The lines are just an outline for coloring in at another session. A tattoo that big takes a couple of sessions to complete. This is just stage 1.
---
My dumbass was about to look up the numbers as sauce
---
Eventually, each spot in the vault is precious. Still not deleting any of the starting items from my three characters. I'm going to remember where I came from.
---
I don't get why we can't infuse stats in gear or something.
---
Neither does the hammer
---
But that would possibly take away from people spending $8+ each on weapon cosmetics!
---
I completely forgot about this map, is it only in certain modes? I seriously haven‚Äôt seen it or played on it in what feels like years
---
Before we put mods on exotics, can we have mods in legendaries? I keep getting weapons with no mod slot for some reason.
---
My guess is the game isn‚Äôt coded to give you more than 1000 but hard to say
---
This joke is getting old
---
Cade
---
Still, Warlock are at the bottom when it comes to melee
---
Clicking back on comp works sometimes to get it to trigger the final stage of crucible bounties.
---
If handheld super nova goes then throwing knife goes. Bottom tree has been nerfed. Doesn't heal in super, diminishing returns, the light attack uses more super energy.
---
He's so moved he gives you a gun so you can shoot yourself
---
Yup, I'm just waiting for the downvotes to roll in. Because I've been playing a hunter since launch.

This is the kind of quality content I signed up for. You get an Upvote. Happy Dawning, Guardian!!
---

Collector using arbalest, reaper using a scout, invader using a grenade launcher, and sentry using a hand cannon....yup, this checks out as being the realistic gambit team of randos

---
This bug triggers me so damn much because I want to farm a good JKQ roll
---
*shanks star floating out of the holes in the wall*
---
A post about not insulting people while insulting people. Awesome. 
---
As a player who plays all three classes regularly in both PvP and PvE, I see where you are getting at. But you are fooling yourself if you don't think the "aim assist" on the new knife is a bit much. I know becuase I abuse it like crazy.
---
But other than that no real complaints. About time hunters got a OHK ability in PvP.
---
With upgrading and reaching certain levels on the season pass, my guess is that you will be able to link all 4 at some time.
---
They need funds to support the game so what else can fund a free game of course it's Microtransactions. But the items there abit to pricey.
---
Heard that the most. Thanks for giving your opinion, but can you tell what makes them OP in particular?
---
You will need to grind *a lot* for the +30 power bonus.
---
My favorite weapon in the game is Inaugural Address. With the whole ‚Äúchampions‚Äù mechanic I can‚Äôt do my favorite load out anymore. It normally would be Parcel of Stardust, Inaugural Address, and Curtain Call or 1k voices.  Two weapons are Vanilla so they just aren‚Äôt viable anymore sadly.
---
I don‚Äôt think exotics should have a mod slot. Just imagine icarus on the chaperone, it would make every other slug shotgun obsolete.
---
that's how you get power creep
---
I've slowly come to the realization that all D2 players have the same wife
---
What no reply? Did you check my Gambit statsü§î
---
If barrier, barrier. Else barrier.
---
I'm pretty sure it have to be abilities kills and super too.
---
Specifically the melee they have has such a high damage you don‚Äôt want to be in a fist fight with one
---
HIVE, BRING A SWORD!
---
You say that like it's a bad thing lkl
---
I think it's corny. Some weapons are the exception to the rule but there's a lot of one hitters in D2.
---
yikes, that would be horrible.
---
First off, no
---
Is the fifth person in your fireteam just afk because he died?
---
Okay. Maybe that's the reason people think Titans only punch things?
---
Thanks!
---
Those are fun for messing around but useful only in like add clear scenarios in PvE as far as I have experienced. Pairing it with Monte Carlo was really fun for a bit, but for any serious business the Ophidian Aspect goes on.
---
Yes you should definitely go without ever saying that again

My friend that got me playing D1 was a hunter main and hated his warlock cause of the jump. One week I was cleaning up on CoO with my tlaloc and he's like what the f is that gun? (should note he is a scout rifle snob) he started playing his warlock a bit to try it out and after that he started playing his warlock weekly just to use that gun. That is a good example of just how awesome that gun is. It turned him into a floaty Boi lol!
---
That sucks because this isn't like a normal season pass it's basically a small dlc, no different than Osiris or shadowkeep but with less content
---
It's not competitive burst DPS, but it's good fun with good survivability for horde modes like Sundial or Menagerie or just general play.
---
My question is:
---
*Where the fuck did his memorial, cloak, and Colonel go after Festival pf the Lost?!*
---
The fuck Bungie?
---
You‚Äôre not wrong
---
Nice.
---
Last fish raid. Coming 2069...
---
Which exotics have that naturally other than leviathan?
---
That's neat. Exotics in D1 felt exotic.
---
Didn't mean it like that. Was just continuing your sentence on how people mostly see Titans
---
I swear I spend more time flying to places to pick up bounties than I do actually playing the game
---
Hunter is best class
---
Right? I tried explaining that it's no different than buying new content like we have for D1 and early D2. No different than paying for the "annual pass"
---
Have you ever heard of the worldline zero glitch?
---
When people insult people for playing a certain class in my experience it‚Äôs just a joke no one really cares
---
Here let me clear that up for you
---

2. Titan
---
3. Titan
---
4. Titan
---
The might of the Cabal? Child's play. The magic of the Hive? Piece of cake. But nothing could prepare the Vex for one angry Titan head butting the shit out of anything that moved.

Can I check that with the app or I need to be in the console (PS4)?
---
Does Cause come with a bullet hole?
---
Last word ornament is fucking sexy.
---
Yup! They are in Every GAME in UK, esp in Central London

Plus you get seasonal weapons. It's basically niobe labs with more instruction and a new menagerie
---

Hive on floor five?

Exactly! Your season pass progression is dependent on completing every available bounty. The requirements for some of these bounties are extremely play flow disruptive.
---
Give me a few examples, because they may be year one weapons.

---
I did a lot of solo Comp and solo PvP. I used a lot of weird exotics and sometimes no exotics. Best to be a Saint-14 addicted bubble boy or an Ursa face-rusher then the OEM player. You'll find a better exotic and your team can go F themselves sometimes
---
Riven has 10 eyes tho. 0/10
---
Yeah, me too.
---
I assumed it's Bungie just trying to get me to go to the store to buy more stuff, but really it's probably a bug.

I'd like it fixed too.

No I totally did! And I totally agree with the one very tiny little exception that Hunter mains are complete trash. Utter garbage.
---
now I have to get the cayde one
---
Monte Carlo is so good with doom fang pouldrons on titan. You can get your super up in like 30 seconds.
---
You better treat her right. That's a keeper imo. Lucky lucky man. You keep being a kick ass husband for her bud! Happy Dawning to you and your family!
---
? I don't think this still is free now. Idk tho I'm new.
---
I looked up how to get it and I've done all the stories, and still am not given the option to acquire it as the guide showed.
---
use the quest for the oven in your quest log and add ingredients to it. You can find guides for the specific cookies in the same subreddit.
---
It says that it's showing perks recommended from the community. If you click learn more, you will see that blue is meant for PvE and Red for PvP. Gold is either.

They represent which ones are the best, yellow - best, blue - ok, red - bad
---
What's worse is the cloak ornament with a quiver on it. But the quiver is covered by your other fucking weapons, so I wasted 1500 bright dust (that's 30 bounties)
---
I thought my game was bugged because when i went to the hangar i saw perfect paradox floating like it was on someone's back and there were some guardians standing in front of it. Guess it's just timegated though.

I kinda figured that! Thanks though!

I have one of each character so no

Really? I feel like even LFG is easy now. Everyone knows what to do at this point.

You get the essences guaranteed from the relevant Nightmare Hunts ie Essence of Anguish from the Nightmare Hunt: Anguish.
---
Yeah, the infinite melee/grenade Dawnblade is pretty ridiculous.  I played the Shadowkeep strike last night on the strike playlist and literally only used abilities, getting 167 kills while the other 2 players had like 70 and 50.  It's like being a living meteor storm.  Synergises so well that unless I missed with my ranged melee, I literally always had my grenades and melee back immediately.  Dead simple too:
---
High Discipline - 70+ in my case
---
High Strength - 70+ in my case
---
Top Tree Dawnblade with solar grenades
---
Sunbreakers with enhanced momentum transfer
---
You fire the ranged melee at low tier mobs and get a kill, which procs Sunbreakers.  This means that you can now throw 5 grenades at once and you cover all the enemies with grenades.  The solar grenade dot tics seem to stack from all the grenades and you immediately get your melee back.  You can then fire it again and immediately throw 5 more grenades.  None of the abilities, mods or exotic perks seem to have any kind of cooldown, so as long as there are some lower tier mobs to kill with the ranged melee, you can melee and thrown grenades non literally non stop.   It's absolutely ridiculous, but it's so much fun :)
---
I psychically shook my head in disapproval. Take my fucking upvote
---
That‚Äôs definitely not what it means.  Full choke and rifled barrel are both red and neither one of them are bad in the slightest.  Where are you even getting this info from??

You don‚Äôt have to get super kills in crucible. You can do it anywhere you want. You just need the 25 player kills in crucible. That‚Äôs it.
---
This is the most Titan thing I've ever seen.
---
I‚Äôm calm af. A bit exaggerated. But I just appreciate every bit of support  since I‚Äôm working every day to get better and post on if and reddit every 3-4 days.
---
Wow. Thanks!
---
First off, stop.  I hate PvE and would wish all quests were PvP based.
---
Second you only need to kill25 guardians in PvP.  
---
The 25 kills with your ult can be done anywhere, it doesn't have to be in the Crucible.
---
Apart from the picture, how is this related to D2?
---
I‚Äôm glad you like it and I mean that sincerely. D2 should absolutely be played how you want, with the weapons you want, whenever possible. 
---
But often it‚Äôs not possible to use that weapon. It simply doesn‚Äôt hold a candle to other Energy 150 HCs like Luna/NF or something like JQK3, and for advanced or endgame content you simply can‚Äôt equip a HC at all in your energy slot. 
---
I like to run with Y1 stuff when doing basic content and even some Crucible stuff, because I love the guns. So I get you. And I absolutely encourage you and everyone else, including and especially the sweaties that turn the game into a DPS math problem, to try *everything* and learn to have a lot more fun. But the community isn‚Äôt about to shower any love on a gun, no matter how much entertainment it provides, that‚Äôs irrelevant in the metas for every single meaningful mode.
---
I just dislike the presence of MTX not having a tangible increase in quantity or quality of content. I just feels like the money from Eververse is put back into Eververse. If an Eververse refresh can be done every season I don‚Äôt understand why other vendors excluding Rahool haven‚Äôt been touched in over a year
---
Eververse bad.
---
I said powerful gear. Not pinnacle. My light level is not currently high enough for pinnacle. What I wanted was the powerful gear drops so I can get to the point where I‚Äôm ready for pinnacle activities.
---
I‚Äôm so sorry I was being sarcastic! Did you watch the show The Office?
---
Yeah, pretty sure this one of the fancy paid cheats in destiny 2. (teleporting, noclipping etc etc.)  
---
I've encountered these said cheats two times so far, and even that is too many times.
---
I can hear the trombones from this picture
---
25 kills is not that bad.  Go into control, and stick with a teammate.  Get a shot in on anyone near you if you can, and you get credit for the assist/kill.  This should work, unless you have to get the final kill shot which is rare in a Bungie quest line like this.  I have not done the 25 kills just yet (had other obligations since Tuesday), so I am not sure if it requires kill shot, or just kills.
---
No my friend gave it to me, though he could've stole it
---
You can only kill guardians in Crucible or Gambit, but obviously Crucible is the "fast way". As I said, I don't like being dragged to an activity I highly dislike, I don't get why they even did this in first place.
---
I think it's more a case of other weapons just being too weak, as opposed to Izanagi's being too strong.
---
I'm not necessarily disagreeing with you, but Shattered Peace and Chaperone is the load out that got me to Legend, so it's it's definitely viable, and far handles NF. 
---
It's just sad to see a weapon that still drops but still does the old masterwork method and has one slot for a "random roll." If they aren't gonna change weapons like them, don't let them drop, just put them in collections so I know it's over :(
---
All good then, this meme was posted on r/destinymemes a while ago
---
Shattered Peace was awesome in year 1! I loved it in my high mobility build.

I guess it could make a comeback with random rolls but... well, there probably is already a gun with the Shattered Pace base stats
---
A Google search would have answered your question. Or even just scrolling down a bit.
---
Warlock : Nopes
---
Ah it's my bad then!
---
Don't say that! Lmao Shattered Peace is awesome, but you prolly right.
---
Does anyone bother looking to see if shit has been posted already before making another one?
---
Not even that far.
---
That's hilarious; doing this kind of thing is quite literally pointlessly asking to be banned
---
Ye I guess so
---
Seems like I have some killing to do

I‚Äôll see myself out
---
It‚Äôs the probably the most frequently posted thing on this sub right now.
---
It takes some practice to learn a better depth perception with it but once you have it it‚Äôs fun. Also with a relationship fee mod and the catalyst it reloads really fast.
---
Not everything in the game can be pve based, regardless of your desire for it to be. And the 25 kills is not hard to get. Even if you‚Äôre a bad pvp player and only get six or seven kills a game, you can still get this step done in four games or less.
---
That's dumb. Don't even have to ADS.
---
TIL thank you for answering though
---
The lack of concern on that adult is startling. Your kid almost got crushed by the red legion and they are worried about getting to the tower to turn in a non powerful engram. Smdh

This is the first time i encountered a cheater since the game released. I think its wrong but I still think it was funny.
---
But but *looks all around for social acceptance and affection*
---
Eververse bad!
---
No need to be rude, I appreciate the help and answers given.
---
Well in that case you are missing out on:

Eris Weekly
---
Lectern Weekly
---
Weekly Moon Mission
---
Weekly Hunts
---
Weekly Nightfall: The Ordeal
---
I clearly didn‚Äôt make my point clear, so I‚Äôll try and be more outright with it this time.
---
This strike is in rotation on the vanguard strike playlists, and I therefore can run it without shadowkeep. 
---
The addition of a few champions shouldn‚Äôt remove my access to the activity at all, because I can still fight champions via the moon open world area (yes this is accessible to people who don‚Äôt have shadowkeep) and the Sundial activity.
---
The argument I‚Äôm making is that the addition of champions should not remove my access to the activity as I can still fight champions in other activities.
---
To be fair hunters also get decent buffs alot more than other classes, especially that last couple seasons.
---
Perfect! Keep it as is!!
---
To increase player base so the new dlc would reach more consumers

I wish hunter would get a helmet like this, I almost want to main a Titian because if this helm
---
It is...? My cookie lead me there but there was nothing there yet. Didn't see the shotgun, will have another look
---
Love the vanguard symbol at the top
---
I‚Äôm gonna guess $3.5k to $4k.
---
Wwwwwhat? Oh ok, Bungie. I get it.
---
This is the way.
---
Ya I'm gonna start afk farming each night and spending the essence on those bounties. They've so quick and easy, especially if you get someone at the tower.
---
We're not all mindless meatheads, some of us just like to unleash our inner barbarian and punch everything to ***DEATH***

Shaxx on the fax

Damn you right
---
Lmao.

Vanguardarmory pins, right?

Maybe heroic public events? Taken Blight is probably the fastest one. Injection Rig is close 2nd

The tubing kinda reminds me of the tubes on the arbalest. Great build.

Eva‚Äôs Weekly Bounties grant 200 bright dust each, and her daily and repeatable bounties grant 10 bright dust. So if you‚Äôre willing to deliver 600 holiday treats, you can get the bright dust to buy the armour ornaments
---
WTF poor people! They are so lucky they are alive!
---
Figured it was edge transit
---
Worked after the 15th time, how dumb
---
Lol. What game are you playing? What's the ratio of titans/hunters vs warlocks in the crucible for you? 10:1? Because that's how it actually is...if warlocks were really that broken wouldn't more people be maining them this season? Lol. Top tree dawn blade is improved but it's nothing crazy especially once this seasons mods go away
---
What's funny?
---
Not only did he cave in a Kell‚Äôs skull with a head butt, but I‚Äôm pretty sure he head butted that kell so hard it snapped his own neck in the process. Or he did it with a broken neck. I don‚Äôt remember. I think I‚Äôve been emulating S14 too much this week

Yeah lol midnight coup stole that spot

Fake. The invader isn‚Äôt holding a truth.
---
Hey uh, what shader is that?
---
It is, if you compare it to what titans have been able to do all this time
---
Yeah I think season mods should work, but for normal mods no. You know that heavy shotgun exotic with a one bullet magazine just slap an extended mag mod or whatever it‚Äôs called and now it‚Äôs literally 2x the dps
---
Do you have a link to the siva one? Id like to see that
---
Your comment has been removed in violation of our rule to be KIND, respectful, and courteous.

I'd say something like austringer but I haven't used it too much or Duke although I'm not too sure about the rolls you can get on it.
---
Yes, the third best waifu/husbandu from Destiny franchise, where the best one is Mithrax (But Shaxx is VERY close to him in that regard imo)
---
Yea, I know it is but this just felt dirty
---

I don‚Äôt unfortunately, I saw it a couple of days ago. Gimme a bit to see if I can‚Äôt find it in my history
---
Might be best to just get them as you go. It would probably be a bit overwhelming to get it all at once
---
Crota touched my scrota
---
I love that tarrabah is just not included
---
Crota in a soda.... can
---
I'm kinda the same way. A lot of the exotic weapons I wanted required a lot of PvP. Thorn, The Last Word, Ace of Spades... To name a few... But after a little while, I got more into it. I'm not going to be like everyone else on here and say "then just don't do it"... I feel it. I don't like the idea that I had to grind out crucible matches to get those hand cannons, or to do a shit ton of Gambit to get Malfeasance, or Lumina. I agree. There should be exotics that are just as good as PvP exotics, but you get for doing PvE. I don't understand why there aren't any
---
Dude, only time I play Striker is when I get bored of holding a shield and decide to strap on my Skullfort and throw myself at some ogre faces for a while. Bottom tree is irrelevant to me.

Vanguard in Asgard
---
OoOh BoiIii! hErE I gO fLoOdInG aGaIn!
---
Thanks that worked
---
Really? Cuz I can‚Äôt find the tweet on bungie a profile. If it is though I take back my words
---
Only parts of the game are free to play.  They want to get you hooked like the rest of us so that you will spend money to buy the new DLCs.
---
As someone who just ordered a closed loop aio(corsair h115i Pro) for the first time, you don't clean those because they are closed right?
---
Hows it bugged?
---
Middle tree solar, and one of the following: Ophidia Spathe, Polaris Lance, or Prometheus Lens. Infinite throwing knives in pve. 
---
This isn't really a game with "full builds," exactly.
---
This is fake
---
Nope
---
Thats the exact motherboard im getting for my new pc. How is it? Ive read some great reviews and some not so great reviews. I only plan on getting an i7-8700k and a 2080 super no matter how much i want the TI i just cant justify spending that kind of money on my salary. Should i just go for an i9 9900k or will the i7 8700k be more then enough for high end gaming? (going for 2k not fully interested in 4k if im being honest though id use it if my computer can handle it)
---
I'd imagine vex milk tastes like a mix of sweet cream and  w-d 40.
---
I don't know why you are being downvoted.  This build is fun for clearing trash,  but high end activities it's horrible.  Mobs are too much of a bullet sponge to reliable proc the grenades.
---
Best XP outside of bounties would be Crucible or Gambit.
---
It‚Äôs for the Hackberry Tart which you give to Benedict on Nessus
---
Aliens in a hallway?.........what am I missing?
---
Yeah no need to mess with aio, meant to stay contained and never opened
---
If bungie decides to bring back Cayde 6 that would probably be the worst writing in the games history
---
Bungo has blocked off this week‚Äôs nightfall ordeal for me.  SoThere might be a chance that giving cookies to Saint might be blocked.
---
Rick khakis coming back from the gym?
---
Ah, thanks
---
Upholding the law is not being asshole about anything. The guy lost 15 motes? The guy does the time.
---
not fake just 2-3 years old
---
Its still one of the best handcannons honestly.
---
I love it myself, middle tree and just being an actual missile for a few seconds. Getting into hammer titan as well so irrelevant for me too. Especially since I'm a filthy hunter most of the time. 
---
Saying that I do like bottom tree I just don't like exploiting near infinite self healing supers, might be time to pick it up again.
---
Dude that is Amazing! In my voice not Shaxx, the vex milk coolant is the bestest
---
tarrabah where?
---
That‚Äôs pretty comical! I do the same with Edge Transits and Crooked Fangs. Makes the Burnt Edge cookies hidden triumph more comical now!
---
The end triggers after the dialogue is over. So in this case the fault was Ghost's and Emo Morn's.
---
Ironic how the xbox 360 loads much faster
---
Have you tried posting the solution (for console anyway)?
---
1) Change your system clock. 
---
2) Spawn into your own instance.
---
3) Access obelisk.
---
4) (optional) Correct system clock to play with blueberries again.
---

Don't wear new items if you're not getting the stats you want from them. Use upgrade modules instead to destroy them to level your favorite gear. I've carried my current rifle since 760 and I'm 909 now
---
Took me a while. There should be a ceremony about Cayde. Like a cinematic we could always watch by interacting aith the plaque.
---
I'd just YouTube "new light guide." Sure they'll explain things in more detail than I can on Reddit.
---
I would have t bagged him so fucking harf
---
This needs way more upvotesüòπüòπ
---
One might say that it‚Äôs not vex milk..
---
I literally read an article a few hours ago and Deej said in the interview that they have nothing to say about trials returning at this time.
---
So we should just sit and let Bungie fuck us with their exploitative monetization practices? We should let them psychologically exploit the most vulnerable people in their community? Because you find it annoying that people are too critical of a game you like?
---
Don't get me wrong, I adore Destiny 1 and 2. They are some of my favorite games ever. But that's exactly why I'm opposed to Eververse in its current state.
---
Very few people are saying to get rid of the cash shop. Far from it: people are generally quite understanding that Bungie needs a consistent revenue stream after having split from Activision. But that doesn't mean we should be complicit in such an obvious scam.
---
.......backup mag on sweet business.
---
I like the burning knife emote I bought last week. It is still epic. Have a nice day.
---
Done that many, MANY times and it doesn't do anything. My Warlock was fine but my Titan and Hunter have had a nightmare trying to access it.
---
Ah ok. Thank you very much!
---

There's a glitch right now that lets you get heavy from special boxes. Only works for linear fusions that I know of though.
---
Okay. So if I wanna play them
---
On my pc I just have to buy them
---
Off steam correct?
---
I bought the shadowkeep bundle on steam already. So like are you talking about the new battle pass thing?
---
Oh I think that was OP .I should have checked the original post I thought by it was something else. I tried Titan today sine it was ok  only two days in so im still in the dance as to what to main.
---
It is content that COMES WITH THE GAME. You should be entitled to acquire anything that is in a video game's files without having to pay extra for it. I don't understand how you can possibly argue otherwise.
---
Imagine ordering a burger, but the waitress takes the pickles off of the sandwich before giving it to you and demands you pay an extra 50 cents for them. Would that not be absurd?
---
Good to know because I thought it just destroyed people.

I know the Crystalline Shell is going to be available for Silver in 2 weeks time or bright dust in 3 weeks time. That shell always has Guiding Light perk which gives a 10% xp bonus.

"Lol people who don't like exploitative monetization practices are just too poor to afford them."

Did you actually read what you just typed?

Yeah, arc titan onepunching my full health hunter to death is 
---
Fun.
---
Honestly depends how good the other team is at invading. The oppositions invader can make or break your game if he's constantly team wiping you. But gambit is heavily PvE focused and you can run Reckoning which is Co-op PvE mode to get Reaper Armor which will make you specialize in the PvE killing element and then your team can't get angry at you for not invading.
---
On console maybe but on PC outside of Gambit it's not really a issue 
---
Snipers shotguns and handcannons are way more used and abused
---
The determining factor is being able to use it when there are no other players near it. Using fast travel/sparrow method instead of the Orbit RNGesus method is just slightly faster.
---
I'm such a chad that I don't own this weapon.

Proof that symmetry is literally insane (nice btw)

A real rarity during those days indeed

Stop trying to hit me and HIT ME!

Oh definitely. It's just it never works for me üòî

Thankfully I've been able to pick up all the bounties so I can work on getting the Nessus Obelisk to rank 11 before I start on the final one...the dreaded EDZ üòÇ

I feel this, recently had to make the move from 13s to 14s and it's a tough life T-T

Well its not like Bungie can do much to combat hackers since they refuse to use dedicated servers for PvP.
---
Humph, "Juice-box"...
---
That exposed gpu pcb is very cool
---
Okay Boomer
---
It‚Äôs just an outlaw rampage hand cannon, do people go nuts over it because it has those as static perks? Just never understood why people worship this gun like it‚Äôs better than Recluse.
