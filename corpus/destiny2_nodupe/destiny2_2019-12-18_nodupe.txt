Seems to be a trend here with multiple player not being able to interact with it. Few in a clan I know have it as well :(

No idea on that one. To be honest I really don't pay attention to anything but the power level.

Quite possibly gimping myself a bit but trying to keep everything else straight makes my head hurt.

What  I hate is when I am doing a forge and we are on the boss. I go down and teammates stops DPS to res me. Everytime I want to yell at them "NO! Just DPs the damn boss! Your 3-4 secs is better spent doing that than ressing me. Rarely am I doing enough damage to feel like taking the time to res me is worth it. And it is always someone who stops rather than resses while still firing. I don't mind that, just please don't stop shooting.

Yikes i'm so sorry

Where is Xur to give his, have a bounty for it that expires in 24 hours, surely they wouldn‚Äôt give that if he‚Äôs not around ?

If she tossed my Salas and I kept my hips gyrating, who do you think I would end up calling?

No because a red glow pops up when going over an enemy and why do you want this ‚Äúadvantage‚Äù anyway

Fair enough :)

I'll try and see if I can get a drop or two of it and have a looksee at the stats. Thanks for the headsup.

Same here buddy saaaaammmmeere

Pretty sure he's either time locked or there's a glitch.

Why would I not be surprised if they make her the better vendor without telling anyone

Now you can pay an extra 5 dollars to suffer

Zavala: it does make sense i swear

I don‚Äôt know for certain, but if I were to guess, forge completions.

*spits out crayons* WHAT!!!

I know your light level can drop from resetting the seasonal artifact. Could that be to blame?

Too much internet

Go to ur Platform. Drop down and it‚Äôs in that same room that you float down. Just a small snow globe. No pics as I haven‚Äôt done it yet but seen the photos, u can just google it

Low effort meme to match low effort development decisions

I don‚Äôt know for certain, but my best guess is to get lucky with a forge completion.

That's where saint 14 is supposed to be.

The worse line to ever be in Destiny 2 since day 1. That dialogue annoys me.

Just a tip for the tanks in Zero Hour- If you‚Äôre a Titan, use Code of The Commander and chuck a void wall grenade under them- It will eviscerate them and quickly recharge your grenade.
---
I agree I always saw them as the worst enemy is destiny just because of how boring they were, but now I feel like a long needed hatred has been ignited that is sure to make people hate the fallen. And I'm looking forward to see what they're going to do with them next

If you're in PC it'll probably go on steam sale, if it's not already

It's in the Triumphs thing. If you still can't find it I'll do a search on how to navigate to it and post it.
---
What..? Theres no pvp requirement for the savior title at all. And if there was, making getting all ritual and pinnacle weapons a requirement would be just too dumb.

These are all the triumph needed for savior title, includes secret ones.

Bungie is getting that bread (aka $10)
---
This happend to one of my friends in a divinity run and we had to do a separate run for him.
---
you are great at photoshop lol
---
Well that arguable because bungie does that rounding up numbers thing,and still a tranquility w firing line outputs more dps snd overall damage and u can run boss spec on it while using anarchy to do more dps
---
There is just no way that this gun can compete in a dps scenario,not without a buff that is
---
Eh, I don't believe that for a second. You wouldn't even have the time to farm 100 Tiers with 50 hours of work.. Let alone 60.
---
I work 45 Hours a week as a Retail Assistant and I find it hard to farm for stuff on a daily basis, at times I get pissed off because I never have enough time to get the titles due to work.

Once you hit power level 770, I recommend doing the Dawning (holiday event).

I approve the asdf movie meme
---
What gun is that, and with what perks?
---
Ok, because I just did some testing with a friend's on PC. And I believe it's a console specific bug.
---
My guess is that it's a framerate bug, similar to what happened last year with chaos reach damage being less than intended

Tfw you have to save the greatest Titan that ever lived from some Fallen peons

Every Hunter is in on the Dare, regardless if they like it or not. The dare was that any Hunter who killed him would become the Vanguard. Uldren killed him, then became a Hunter. His lack of experience doesn‚Äôt disqualify him from the Dare, and his leadership and skill in the past has shown that he‚Äôs more than capable of being the Vanguard. Zavala might protest but Ikora would recognize that Uldren after his rebirth has no recollection of his sins of the past.
---
All in all, even an inexperienced Uldren could make a fine leader, if the Vanguard isn‚Äôt disbanded altogether in the next few months/years
---
I feel exactly like Hellboy when his joke falls on deaf ears of the Osiris Club.
---
Don‚Äôt push it. It‚Äôs ok. I got your point.
---
As long as you're 940+ I'd say so yes. I did half of it 2 man with one of us under levelled on my first run, you can do it I believe!
---
Let me know too lol
---
What,no izanagi does something like 25k dps LITS does like 13k its its not even comparable
---
Nice job bungo! now just nerf the fuck out of arbalist in crucible and were good
---
ive never seen this before in my life , im confused.
---
What does this have to do with anything?
---
Oh really, I had thought that might be it but I had no way to test it, so it floats normally on pc but you float down faster on console?
---
I understand that it‚Äôs obnoxious as hell to be mapped by that fusion but it can easily snipe some one from double that distance. Yea it needs tuning but it should still kill consistently from that range.
---
^you're ^^so ^^^evil
---
Bungie gave us 5 ways to get riskrunner, world drops,exotic mission, xur, and i forgot the other 2
---
Hahaha yes!
---
That seems to be the case. This issue needs more attention so it can get patched. I already made a post on the forums

Well I‚Äôm 960 and he‚Äôs 930 hopefully o can carry him

God bless your mind for sitting through that.

That is also possible. But he‚Äôs the one who fits the bill and every other Hunter that could be made Vanguard has fled the Tower and is in hiding so they don‚Äôt get the job

Fhere is a Reality where XURxGRAVEMIND is canon
---
Exact same case for me. Weird.
---
Yeah I know lol but I've been getting a few messages lately asking how I go it so I was just wondering
---
Nope. I lowered my power to 365 and have been monitoring my gameplay for a while now. I have only encountered AFK players doing the same thing. Before Shadowkeep, people used to do this same thing. I never once encountered a player actually trying to do a forge. You will only instance with people who lower their Power like I have. Because nobody trying to actually do a forge will lower their power this low, you can‚Äôt encounter people trying to do forges legit.
---
I was using a pulse rufle you get from the black armory idk how anyone can get mad at that

Fisher, you are paid to be invisible.

No but I would consider it ugly... he too wide

The title was directed towards the amount of treats you need to bake. Mind you that this is the first of 3 bounties which each one will probably require you to bake even more
---
You are a god sendüôè
---
Not true, been at over 900 power and seen people with really low power levels in there just standing there. Shits wack how about just play the game

I'll add Shattered Throne to my list.

He is an average player himself, it‚Äôs hilarious when barely competent players talk trash like this.

Aka free stuff.

Saint‚Äôs Ghost was killed by the Martyr Mind, which massively depleted the Vex resources, ate Saint‚Äôs light, and could withstand barrages of high explosives, but Saint 14 killed it anyway.

Sure. This stuff is everywhere the Fallen are. It‚Äôs just background.

Note you cannot pull out or ‚Äúbuild/buy‚Äù collections items that come with random rolls (armor and guns) the only exception being Exotic Armor will come with a shitty roll on it just so you can have it

The Ordeal strike this week is Scarlet Keep, one of the new ones for SK. So...probably.

Are you using armor piercing rounds from the artifact on it?

Yes. It‚Äôs an Obelisk weapon.

Heh I forget the skin name but I remember it can with the Chroma Deluxe bundle. Big Zenistar!

In the notes they said that the hidden perk was for a different weapon later in the season but.. Why not just have two that do it? Seriously it won't get used unless it can compete.
---
The entirety of D2? All quest lines, all collectibles, all everything?

Again, he's boring because he has to be. Not everyone has to be a bloodthirsty warlord getting glory kill after glory kill for fan service like Shaxx and Saint-14.

Damn ok uldren

Excuse me why?
---
Asshole cryptark is a no and hawthorn will show you you
---
Yeah it makes sense now since the game is free to play. I'd actually like spending money on the game if it was free to play from the start. But it was a fully priced $60 video game at release, with multiple $25 dlc packs, and $15+ cosmetic bundles in addition to that.
---
It doesn't need nerfing - it's just a copeles sniper with charge time. And a lot of people use it to farm comodo
---
Look fam, all I‚Äôm saying is that to carry the chain of resurrection, we need Andal Brask.
---
Just knocking on it that it was a 'blue' sidearm, and they tend to get so much hate. To be honest, when it happened, I saw the name and thought it was a decent legendary. I was surprised that it was only rare.

For anyone  curious, it was Dissonance-34: https://destinytracker.com/destiny-2/db/items/3809805228-dissonance-34

Thank you. I apologize if it seemed like I snapped at you.

Bitch we had like 6 vanguard and titans and warlock had/have like 2 and and only 3 of the 6 hunter vanguard are dead and the rest are status unknown/possibly dead or missing/declared dead

Once you unlock projections they are infinitely reusable and viewable through your ghost. So I think that‚Äôs why they don‚Äôt show up in collections?
---
That's a pretty awesome secret Santa gift.  Good job op's ss!
---
What system
---
People still do every raid
---
Yeah mines the same it‚Äôs curated
---
I honestly don't understand why people discard exotics and good roll random weapons. WE HAVE 500 SLOTS IN OUR VAULT! DO YOU EVEN REMEMBER D1?!
---
yea see i have every seal in the game and i hate not being able to show that i have all of them you know and i think colors would be a great way to show off you have multiple seals doubt bungie will ever see this post but thought id just chuck the idea out there
---
I like this one

Xbox One

I've seen a few of these, but tbh, I never get tired of them. I always laugh.
---
Maybe Tangled or Prodigal Armor?
---
Damn I‚Äôm PS4 and PC
---
Tysm!
---
These are my favorite part of this game.
---
So do the past campaigns to get higher gear? And really I‚Äôve been looking on LFG sites and Scourge of the Past doesn‚Äôt even show up.
---
Thank god I'm finished with that dang ritual weapon
---
thanks for trying üòîüòîüòîüòîüò°

replace hawthorne with mara
---
Yea savathuns song
---
You can‚Äôt pull random rolls but you can get back ANY exotic weapon or armor piece no matter what
---
Before you get bombarded with downvotes, Devrim is actually gay in canon. Didn‚Äôt need to bri it up though.
---
why wouldnt bungie just make the quest inaccessible then? Why allow players start a quest if you cant complete it? =(
---
In a new living world where everything is changing Hawthorne gives us the only stable, never changing point!

Finest matterweave...why not just give us the core from the scrapped gear and cut out the unnecessary middle man?
---
I know that. I‚Äôve spent enough time sitting in the church &amp; overhearing him talking about Marc for 12 eons
---
Exotics they drop as floor loot have dupe protection. Anything that drops straight into your inventory doesn‚Äôt.
---
Hmmm i see you are fixing stuff this method too. Works often isn't it? People shoot at you? Use violence, something not work? Use violence. When violence didn't solved something it was only beacuse... Only beacuse you didn't used it enough.
---
I remember hearing my name is byf mention something about this when going over either the lore of saint 14 or the last word+thorn. Pretty sure it‚Äôs saint 14 though.
---
Just shotgun them lol
---
Is riskrunner the only gun of its kind? Like being able to chain kill enemies?
---
damn, PC, it's always the helpful guys on ps4 :D

Destiny having any sliver of new content*
---

---
Probably Devil‚Äôs Ruin, the new exotic laser beam sidearm.
---
Don't you guys already have god tier pvp exotics? Don't forget An actually useful class ability?!
---
The sheer amount of crayons i have consumed have allowed me to transcend the knowledge both the hunters and the warlocks and you do not see the pure genius in my idea.
---
Speak for yoyrself. Im a warlock and i hate cayde
---
nah he just got scared and fell backwards
---
Hmmm so you could say they are riskrunners
---
It‚Äôs bugged rn
---
Zero lol
---
This game doesn‚Äôt give you weapons worth using by default. You have to do all kinds of different activities to get good guns before you will have guns that will kill you. And the existing player base already has these. 
---
Same goes for armor. You have to amass different pieces with varying stat rolls for different builds. 
---
And then there are exotic weapons and armor. 
---
All in all super fun and addicting game. Just don‚Äôt expect to hop into pvp and have as much fun without playing the pve portions for weapons
---
I think we need more JPEGs

Cayde's not dead since Nathan Fillion didn't return for Forsaken

Its F2P base game not F2P everything released.
---
I don‚Äôt know why but these make me laugh each and every time. I watch them a few times and just laugh.
---
So there could always be new lore that brings Cayde-6 back in the future.
---
no
---
What if cayde does come back and uldren is the first darkness guardian, finds the dorito on the moon because he's been spying on us.....and then makes a deal with the vale
---
It needs a riot police shield 
---
(R6s anyone?)
---
It's canon boys. Saint XIV was a Sentinel Titan before Sentinel Titans were even a thing. But he died with the secrets of such badassery that it took YEARS for Titans to ever learn such a super.
---
**The Spider and Mithrax, Kell of Light would like to know your location**
---
Shhhh
---
Good job I actually find this raid one of the hardest to do flawless. One single error in the sparrow area can ruin the whole run quite easily.
---
Like I said, I'm fine paying for a game. When I found out the base game + Forsaken + Shadowkeep was $60, I said "Simple enough. I can do that". What I can't believe is the number of layers it goes. DLC, subscription, mini-DLC, Annual Pass. What are all those? Is there an overlap?
---
I'm not complaining that this game isn't F2P from start to finish. Please at least read the post b4 commenting, I'm really trying to like this game believe it or not and I just need some clarification, but not people making assumptions
---
Oh, I‚Äôm probably wrong then
---
She's gonna collat some bitches.
---
You have all the DLC, you‚Äôre good.
---
Oh God the claustrophobia...
---
Why not?
---
&gt;We were in the middle of adding numbers together when the crayons kicked in
---
idk you may be right ive had really bad luck getting the personal flavor ingredient to drop period. i looked on reddit and some ppl are saying that they had similar issues when running their warlock but they fixed it when they ran their titan. imma give that a shot and see if swords w/o ammo also work still.
---
I've had it since year one
---
Thanks I know And I didn‚Äôt know it was a teaching  hoping I help  teach other people how to do raids and always  about team effort
---
Paywalls are dlc
---
no pay to win mechanics, just pay to have access to quest driven content. You still have to work for the guns in the dlc.
---
Black armory is part of forsaken, it was a seasonal thing. We are in season nine currently. Black armory was back in forsaken's set of seasons. Shadowkeep is 8 and on. Previous season pass is just part of forsaken now.
---
Current season pass has nothing to do with black armory. The pass covers a set of seasons not all seasons and old ones are no longer active if im not mistaken.
---
New light base game comes with the first 2 dlcs if im not mistaken with decent content for free. Just gotta know what to look for/want. Theres alot of content and from forsaken on bloomed troves of more. 
---
Gotta start with the groundwork before you jump for the meta weapons if your in new light.
---
Go for whisper of the worm and sleeper stimulant right now and dont worry about stuff u gotta pay for, it doesnt seem like you're versed enough to know if u will pay for the 2 other dlcs
---
But like I said, the first thing I tried getting was Izanagi's Burden which apparently needs Black Armory. I presumed it must be included so I go to the Tower and try to find Black Armory but it's not there. Am I missing something? Also what's the difference between Forsaken+Shadowkeep and the Annual Pass? Is one just permanent possession and the other like XBox Pass so players can pay seasonally at a cheaper price?
---
Pray allow me to take a line from the Insurmountable Skullfort lore page.
---
"The lights will speak for you. ***Your hands are your eyes now***. Look around."
---
We do not need eyes, our hands are good enough to see what is around us.
---
Dooooot
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure you have to get a kill with your melee ability, not just melees in general. People have also said that the drop rates for ingredients are just piss-poor, so you may just be hitting a streak of bad RNG
---
Who's begging for a useless exotic? Come on, people only used that exotic for jumping puzzles or glitching.
---
According to destiny tracker, dust rock blues is still the fourth most popular weapon in pvp. But mindbenders ambition (energy) has taken over at third. So it seems it's still the most used kinetic shotgun.
---
Superhot
---
Thorn the first time.... Tap tap tap poison run away.
---
An exotic fusion rifle that shoots seven "bolts" that stick to surfaces and explode when enemies come into contact with them. They individually count as entities, which caused some... interesting issues when paired with certain mods or mechanics in the game. The gun has a history of fun bugs and exploits behind it. Those of us who frequently use the weapon say "Telesto is Besto"
---
It's also the name of a moon orbiting Saturn and a Roman/Greek deity.
---
Triumphs tend to spoil a lot of shit.
---
I do that too if I'm lucky with the timing lol
---
I feel the word 'launched' could easily replace 'yeeted'.
---
Ok cool sounds like a fun hunt to use.
---
Not using trade much i see
---
Try using some LFG website, or Destiny 2 PC LFG Discord channel if you are on PC. It's not worth the time trying to solo it just for the bow, especially since you need to run the dungeon twice, unless you really want some tough challenge
---
checked the link, checked the facts, \^ this guy is right lmao
---
Thx
---
I just don't like spending 12 hours grinding materials for a gun, then waiting 24 for it to craft.
---
This thing could use some damage buff I think, the balancing factor would be its long ass draw time that can't be reduced with mods, unlike regular weapon reloading. I would be glad to see an end to this idiotic sniper PvE meta we have now
---
I think thats exactly the problem. Peopls dont just play other characters and use the ability themselves. Its the fastest way to learn what counters said ability
---
I mean. He's doing the best with what he can do. As much as we wish the opposite, Destiny is not more important that RL obligations and I don't understand why people are downvoting him because he can't play EVERYDAY. it's still a crazy bad RNG drop.
---
This was happening last season too to people, check your post, logout if have to
---
Before I clicked on it and it zoomed in, I may or may not have thought this was a legitimate ornament from the upcoming warmind DLC.
---
I have this game on an SSD and loading to a destination still takes an eternity.
---
I wish I had thousands of more upvotes for this comment.
---
You are the best raider, ok. How many worlds first belts you got?
---
Looks awesome, like a Funko pop!
---
Atleast the Hunter's 1-tap melee range ability requires a modicum of precision... Or luck. Rather than 'Be sprinting' or 'Use contraverse holds'.
---
It does say gets cheaper if you already have a piece so It could be, but it last 4 weeks, on the 14th is its last day so it will be gone after reset. If the 14th jan reset is its last week then you have more than enough time to farm 18k for all 3. 
---
But 4 weeks should be enough for two sets if just doing cru, vang and gam weeklies
---
But seeing how eva daily give you 100 (if I'm wrong correct me) then you should be able to farm more than enough br in those 4 weeks to get all 3 sets and then some.
---
Personal touch drops because no-ammo sword kills count as charged melee kills

Oh man, you can spin for ages, I wish my hunter had a throwing emote to use right after I idle in the tower while he uses that emote
---
I‚Äôve done neither of these.
---
No, its a boku no piko reference.
---
Oh I see. Sorry vanguard, but drifter is my guy.
---
+1
---
Spoiler alert: We break Shaxx's horn...
---
Honestly tho if your an invader the only weapon you need is Hammerhead, cause it beams people across the map in gambit.
---
Made out of our enemies remains lol
---
Oh shit oh fuck the Nightmare Guardians got into Gambit
---
Because VEX are stopping you because they perceived saint-14 as the biggest threat to them
---
And the "random guardian" was already foretold to meet saint-14 as told through the perfect paradox shotgun lore
---
It legit could not go any other way
---
Damn ! Thank god i am not crazy ....  
---
Its annoying as hell
---
i agree I miss so much of my d1 gear I dont want the weapons I had the iron banner set on titan that made you look like a knight and never put it down I love this game put alot of money into d2 and d1 and hate that the only way to get good looking armor is to buy from the silver shop. ps I miss my helm so much.
---
Don't worry, Eris will pull you out.... Eris? Eris, you there?
---
You can get even further kills with a loaded question.
---
Yeah, let the poor sap have his fun
---
Yes but it bugged out sometimes. Happened to me once.
---
Green materials come from killing enemies, each faction has a mat. The rest come from stuff like kills with {super, sniper finisher, smg, melee, explosive etc.}, multikills, or creating/picking up orbs of light.
---
PvP is fun if your not playing comp. I dreaded rumble for the longest but now it‚Äôs actually my favorite (mainly because it‚Äôs easier to get kills for bounties from my experience).
---
Most of them I chose not no put (like Sloane). However I did forget Eris.
---
The Spider is in the bottom slot
---
Retribution* and not really better. It‚Äôs a completely different playstyle. It doesn‚Äôt one shot  and has nowhere near the same kind of projectile. I have a god roll Marty and mountaintop, I prefer mountaintop because it works as a sniper if someone is standing still in a sniper lane and not expecting it, but also to fly above someone and then get an easy shot at their feet that will 1 shot. Marty provokes using it then switching to a sidearm, hc or smg for a quick finish. All of which have no range, so you have to play hyper aggressive with it which isn‚Äôt always effective against good teams in comp.
---
Was my pick as well. Second char will be vang
---
Awesome efficiency!  Congratulations on a great match.
---
I am not a fan of Crucible, prefer Iron Banner, but the last several matched I have been in have been quite enjoyable.
---
This worked for me
---
Cuz its a raid.
---
This ^^
---
What quest is it exactly? Just wondering.
---
&gt; The crucible fusion rifle? I wasn't saying that arbalest had a quest.
---
Did you even read his reply?
---
It‚Äôs great love it
---
Raid not a strike mate
---
Dude, this is awesome! I've seen a bunch of Celestial Nighthawk cosplays and yours is straight up one of the best ones I've ever seen, hands down. The attention to detail on the other armor pieces is also great, you did a fantastic job.
---
Me: "Where is he? Where is he?"
---
My friend: "He's at...SHIT HE GOT ME"
---
Me: "Oh shit I got him, I got him.....dammit....he got me"
---
Yikes. Called out lol
---
Don't need to dodge when you're always in attack mode. 
---
*taps temple*
---
Same
---
It tracks from last years dawning.
---
üëçüèª
---
I unintentionally got a ton of those from grinding kills on the shadow thrills in whisper
---
This happened to me. I just turned off the game and came back after an hour.
---
Because we are
---
Izanagi‚Äôs Burden. The one shot body shots I‚Äôve hit with it from across the map have made people leave matches. If I‚Äôm not using that, I‚Äôm using Two Tailed Fox.
---
LOL! Did you read mine? NO ONE was talking about the crucible fusion rifle. He replied to a comment about the ARBALEST
---
Thanks, this will help
---
Nope gone for good
---
Every strike ever.
---
The have some fun is just a try hard loadout.
---
Omg I you were there what?
---
**THROW ANOTHER ONE!**
---
If someone actually used Celestial Nighthawk to kill an Invader in Gambit, I wouldn't even be mad.
---
"You really wanted me dead, huh?"
---
Yes kills while invading or invaders AS A TEAM. Streaks give bonus points.
---
For that kind of thread your better off in r/destinythegame
---
I literally got it last night from a crucible match
---
As a casual player this is what my Hunger still looks like lol
---
Yeah, forcing players to use guns they don‚Äôt particularly like sucks
---
I use mongoloid as a term for big dumb dumbs
---
i don‚Äôt think you know how motion sickness works
---
So Osiris is the greatest warlock. Saint-14 is the greatest Titan. Who's the greatest hunter?
---
NGL at first I thought it was hunter with celestial nighthawk
---
I think I‚Äôd be content as long as he doesn‚Äôt have to die to do it :/
---
Don‚Äôt sleep on sleepy
---
I don‚Äôt...
---
Firstly the spawns aren‚Äôt great and secondly why run towards the super
---
Welp I‚Äôm dismantling it now.
---
Use a motion sickness consumable to debuff the effect...
---
Nah it‚Äôs transversive steps
---
A few deaths and respawn shenanigans and you'll be fine. I was.
---
To be fair it was stated from beginning that we would have to pay for each season. 
---
For me 10‚Ç¨ are definetly worth it.
---
I've been working on getting a streak of 1 for some time now.  
---
Any day...
---
It happened to me a few nights ago im a titan i should of just punched him or atleast yeeted myself at him
---
Hah. Warlocks got their old Vanguard back, Titans got their old Hero back, fuck Hunters
---
Isnt  it wining streaks?
---
Chibi guardian!
---
Titan main, dead-set against an instant-cast OHK Throwing Knife (many idiots argued for it)...quite ecstatic about Weighted Knife though. 
---
It‚Äôs great but doesn‚Äôt feel unfair at all.
---
Paying $10 for their little season rewards if you want okay cool. Locking off the new missions and events as well. No
---
Right? It seems like hunters get all the variety since they have both armor and clothing but titans just get armor and warlocks just get robes. Dont get me wrong they both have a good amount of different choices but there's only so many variations on dude in armor or guy in robes
---
Thanks! 
---
Now we wait until Hallowed Lair...
---
landing a head shot with the amount of aim assist the knife has its not that hard.Some times I just throw it near their head without even trying and it almost like a magnet attaches to the enemy's head.
---
Ophidia Spathe, bottom tree gunslinger
---
i‚Äôd say that izzy is your greatest weapon but ok
---
Invest into bitcoin
---
1000%
---
what are the other sundial weapons besides the side arm auto rifle and gl?
---
Wait, does fighting lion use primary ammo? I got it recently, but vaulted it to try later as I've had so much fun with Martyr's
---
Just buy wealth of the emperors and runefinders and play a ton of strikes or crucibles. It‚Äôs so much better to farm from menagerie
---
Season of Dawn (along with Undying and the next 2 passes) were purchasable along with the digital deluxe version of Shadowkeep, not the regular Shadowkeep (you don't even need SK for Season of Dawn content, right?)
---
What can I say except 4th time's the charm
---
?
---
Dregs promise
---
You mean: used Truth (a very balanced weapon) to get a 4k
---
no one even uses it i was the only person using it
---
here am same feeling as you
---
Honestly just it‚Äôs bugged damage output makes it worth it now.
---
The Sword?
---
yes you would
---
I want to be part of a Fireteam with him and the Drifter.  None of us will trust each other, it‚Äôll be *hilarious.*
---
Yeah, but I would still go for Sunshot lol
---
Good idea
---
Ben Solo was not killed and then reborn by the dark side of the force. He is physically and mentally the same person. 
---
Uldren Sov was killed. We killed him. The Traveler resurrected him in the light as a Guardian. He is physically and mentally different. His appearance is the same, but he is not the same person.
---
For all we know, Saint-14 could be a resurrected Joseph Stalin. Yet, we regard him as the greatest Titan to ever live. His past life before the light is irrelevant, as it should be with Uldren's past.
---
Sweet. It has a Sword Art Online kinda feel in the artwork. I like it.
---
Why are you against paying the company for using their product and enjoying it? 
---
$10 isn't that much and it gives them capital to pay devs, people that work in the game, and provides overall support. Plus they want to turn a profit to justify future releases. 
---
Can't tell if you're just whining to whine or if you are genuinely upset with parting from $10.
---
Wow havent seen that movie in a hot minute
---
it‚Äôs a veist weapon. people have no problem with recluse just being a reskinned veist smg. weapon companies are part of what make this game pretty cool imo with all their guns having the same style. really adds character to the game.
---
Sweet childhood memories ‚ô•Ô∏è
---
Everything is awesome then there's the helmet, oh the helmet
---
(I'm pretty sure that your bow is augmented by your light.  Otherwise you'd have a 0-power bow to work with, and that just wouldn't do at all, now would it?)
---
its good for both pve and pvp it can be real good for pve with that one two punch
---
i wish they worked that way.
---
I'm exo, I am not racist,  to me they really look similar (or I'm just blind)
---
oh
---
I got my cold front from my 2nd gift box. (I think 5 gifts delivered)
---
Might get that headshot
---
Lol I‚Äôm not a huge fan of peach alcohol. üò£ I love actual peaches but artificial/overly processed flavors ü§¢
---
I use a Roar of the Bear with tracking module and cluster bomb, and blast radius almost maxed. I've wiped teams with one shot if they're all standing in the well during their damage phase.
---
Damn the last years have probably seen a lot architects playing Destiny employed! With all those pictures we‚Äôre seeing these days on this sub! 
---
I am so happy!
---
yup. it really adds to the beauty of the weapon
---
Those three knives back to back are very satisfying
---
It‚Äôs too much fun
---
Wwwwwwhat? Engrams are also in D2. What the fuck?
---
Oh fuck not my souls
---
Look at borderlands. Look at destiny...
---
The infographic says that the seasonal artifact is available to all players, but I can‚Äôt seem to figure out how to get it. Online guides say talk to Ikora, who doesn‚Äôt say anything or go to Mercury and talk to Osiris, but there‚Äôs no indication or anything of where he is.
---
Am I missing something? Is Shadowkeep required?
---
i feel like holliday would give you it, but it is from 5 years ago and not relevant anymore
---
Drifter wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to turn you in if it meant an advantage for him.
---
yeah. they have weapon companies and they fit sort of the same style with destiny admittedly realigning stuff unlike borderlands but idk i like it.
---
You do realize he's a governmental and semi-political leader right? He hasn't had a dedicated combative role since Twilight Gap and now his job is to lead the City, not fight.
---
Thanks for the advice
---
He talkin' mad shit for someone in Nova bomb range
---
I give up. People are too stupid to understand what this will lead to. Enjoy paying more and more for worse and worse content. I'm out
---
I'm one of the few who couldn't pick Vanguard fast enough. I laughed when he called me snitch. If this were D&amp;D, I'd be a lawful good Titan.
---
This is true tbh. Look how you got every riled up on this thread lmao.
---
Cabal backpacks don't count.
---
I had to go back to orbit then it worked
---
Ive been getting dicked on by tractor cannon titans in gambit lately
---
all headshots here lol
---
all headshots here
---
Anything must feel like a monster after switching off Breakneck
---
well thanks man i got ptsd from this sht and u just had to bring it back up
---
Thank you
---
Oh, guess i didn't pay attention and thought that was Mithraxx
---
That‚Äôs a possibility. Seems cumbersome in PvP üòñ
---
Loaded Question is a good weapon as is the Service Revolver and Oxygen SR3.  I do use Hazard of the Cast and Malfeasance, though.  
---
Ikora gave me my Monte Carlo, so there's that...
---
I noticed it on the scorn kills in the strike like you said. May not count assists, which I believe strikes do. Idk.
---
Me too it was funny watching everyone load in and walk all over trying to activate it
---
Does it come with a good sauce at least?
---
no assists possible as i turned my time back and was in there alone!!
---
I'm with the Vanguard but truth be told I went with the Drifter. Not because I trust him over Zavala but because you were really picking between the Drifter and Aunor, who's basically some bs internal affairs person and not the real Vanguard. Still, it makes me laugh how many of these people want to work with the Drifter and use the darkness then act like I'm a bad guy when I say I'd cap Uldren's Ghost without a second thought.
---
Ha, you aren't wrong.
---
I did some more baking, and it seems like the tracking was bugged at the beginning but has since been fixed (or fixed itself). I had to bake about 10 items before it started tracking them reliably, and now it seems like I'm getting proper credit for each one.
---
If it is a bug, it's a nasty one to try to track down. I'm just happy that it's working now.
---
Not all supers are equal but no super is weak. They all have strengths and weaknesses, places where they excel and places where they don't.
---
Can I please have Ana Bray...
---
For um
---
Research
---
I won‚Äôt forget to show my work... I won‚Äôt
---
Ironically scout rifles seem like the best all-around invasion weapon.
---
Honestly though, if we‚Äôre talking meta builds then really all you need is a team full of izanagi‚Äôs or whispers and you can basically one-phase the primeval anyway.
---
I'm one of the scummy people that uses this paired with a sidearm and I got it randomly after a crucible game
---
But that's a grenade and most grenades can kill. Voidwalker is all about charging grenades not to mention it's the worst super in the game.
---
I always say that this sub is the Freefolk of Destiny
---
I used it last season with unstoppable rounds for ordeals and nightmare hunts, but not so much anymore.  It is effective in pvp I just don‚Äôt play that much.
---
You play IB. Which isn't out yet.
---
The one shot knife f**ks with me so hard though. The animation has no flow so it‚Äôs difficult to get a feel for it.
---
Yes, and the other few hundred people who‚Äôve been posting this non stop for the past 24 hours,
---
Then yes, I can confirm it doesn‚Äôt line up lol.
---
Maybe *you* can. I think I've made that jump once in maybe 20 attempts. I can't be assed to do that fuckery for something I'll just end up sharding back to collections.
---
Yes, finally heavy slot hand cannon!
---
That is very true, they need to make money somehow but if we as the community take all the bs and let them do as they wish the next thing we gonna see are probably pay2win stuff.
---
He vibin
---
Then i consider myself lucky, i only get shotguned/reclused/arba(mo)lested.
---
Say it is that easy for the Darkness to creep in. So what? We've all done it. I'm guessing you probably went through the trouble of recreating Thorn? Got your hands on Crimson? Made Malfeasance? Deathbringer? We've been turning the strength of our greatest fears and enemies to our own advantage for years now, and killing one man is going to send me over the edge? I doubt it. And then there's the fact that we've been on a genocidal rampage for half a decade, atomizing anyone who so much as looks at us the wrong way, all in the name of the City and the Traveler. We've all been walking that line for a long time. Some of us just saw what was on the other side of it sooner.
---
True, with no regard for colatoral damage.
---
Whether or not it's bought with cash shouldn't be an issue though. There is nothing that actually requires another currency to be involved.
---
Do you play comp a lot? I pretty much only play comp and it runs rampant.
---
Wasn't it given as quest reward? I have it, but got no idea how I got it.
---
Funny.

---
Right but Zavala and ikora get salty with you.
---
Anyone else wish they could investigate Drifter without siding with the Vanguard?  I honestly didn't want to side with either.
---
I did all three of these yesterday and it still doesn't work for me. Feels bad
---
To be fair, with Supernova you do have to get somewhat close and charge it for a while, and with shoulder charge you are fairly limited to aping. 
---
The knife, while it does take skill, does have an enormous range and quite generous magnetism to it. 
---
You‚Äôre not killing any snipers from behind cover with Supernova or shoulder charge, I‚Äôll tell you that much. Doesn‚Äôt mean Weighted Knife is too strong, but the ability is a bit more generous than what the other classes have available.
---
Pocket sand?
---
Ha ha! That's always been a thing along with people crutching Grenades and Horseshoes. If you treat it as a RL that's fast and has an awesome turn radius, you'll own. If you count on the tracking or perks too much, you'll get owned. 
---
Also, G and H can work against you as I can charge you and use the blast radius and that perk to take you down. I'm not afraid to sacrifice myself to save my team and win the match. üòä
---
the only thing i buy are brightdust stuff but there are a lot of people who spend a lot of money on eververse and this makes bungie think their prices are normal so as community we are kinda split half of us want a change and half of us keep buying it making them think its ok what there doing
---
Lol, found the hunter. 
---
Handheld is dumb as hell too.
---
Hammers have meh tracking and only heal you if you hit a player with it and pick it up, even then the healing isnt that fast. 
---
Have you ever tried getting roaring flames x3?
---
The fact that my comp team got wiped by one guy with his knife for our first 3 lives and then this guy has his super the next round because he had mediocre aim is dumb as shit.
---
if you hit an enemy which was just damaged by the Fighting Lion but not killed, when you kill it with the FL you get an instant reload
---
Well now but I know saint would have gone to bat for Cayde.
---
Tbh, I don't even know what refers to comp, survival? I usually play control or clash cause survival makes me rage, even though i got to around 2700 in it.
---
Random drop
---
I've actually never gone through with making Thorn, Malfeasance, or Deathbringer. I had Crimson early on, but Hand Cannons aren't my thing.
---
You sir you Amazing creature you are my Target Audience... This man ( Rahool) screwed me over so so so many times but I had no choice the only other Cryptarch worked at the Reef and he was just dam creepy and also shat on Rahool
---
Yeah survival is comp.  I could understand why it's make you rage, because people use the most broken loadouts possible for wins lol.  Other game modes people play to have fun.
---
*At the bottom in large print* THROW MORE GRENADES
---
this is a controller problem, not a game problem, your left trigger is probably sticking
---
My point stands; we've been collectively dabbling in the darker side of the light longer than any of us would like to admit. It should come as no surprise when another Guardian finally becomes part of that body count.
---
Saladin's Spiced Rum looks delicious.
---
I personally haven't had much of a problem dealing with the knives yet and have seen most players whiffing them pretty hard. Top player will be very good with them while lower skilled players will get the occasional good game with em. One day Destiny might be in place where everything feels far more balance or not weighted heavily towards one class or another, but until that day...I'll eat my crayons and punch walls.
---
Dont have shadowkeep/forsaken :(
---
man that sucks! hope they patch it soon! dont worry your not missing out on much anyway, besides maybe those 2 bounties.
---
*Chuckles in middle tree sunbreaker*
---
Not Forgotten is still the best HC on console IMO.
---
Ok thank you
---
This is the way
---
I just did that and it didn't do what you are saying.
---
Y‚Äôall talking mad shit for someone in blade barrage distance
---
sucks that titan gets a OHK on every subclass tho
---
The vanguard allegiance quest was less involved that the drifter quest, I think a few nightfalls or strikes shorter.  So 3rd character went vanguard.
---
Warlock main here. (Like, 1350 hours versus my others in my 1500 hour playtime) Started playing my hunter a bit more recently, and the biggest thing I'm surprised by is their survivability in high level PVE scenarios.
---
And...the dodges. I don't know why, but they are just so satisfying.
---
Honestly in 6v6 I dont even notice my teammates or my enemies till the final card. 
---
As for comp if I notice someone on my team struggling I give them a non aggressive suggestion that would better they're play style which is met with hateful responses 
---
Good players dont send hate. Bad players dont hate help
---
"There are no quest steps except the quest steps" basically lol
---
The Queens breaker
---
Freefolk took things lightly until Season 8. Then they turned into a non-stop hate-train directed towards the producers and direction. Admittedly, it was really dissapointing for an ending, but they never seemed to let it go and move on. Oh, they're also assholes who didn't care about spoilers. So they can go eat dicks.

We always had SOMEONE die on the Safety Dance.

Quickdraw KC was the closest i ever got 
---
QD gives snipers a sort of fake snapshot, actual snapshot is faster ofc
---
Bruh
---
Let's hope. Just got mine!
---
Ikora is mom
---
It's good where it is. I've gotten good enough with it to where I use it for most fights my guns arent good for and it has saved me from dying where I would've pre-buff
---
If it has to be on nessus, the levithan raid and raid lairs should be decent
---
But... You asked how to Max it out in your post... 
---
So that makes ppl think you didnt know.
---
You cant mod exotic weapons in the current sandbox either.
---
Have you talked to Ada in the tower?
---
Wish this was one of those animated phone screensavers
---
Nice work. Keep practicing. Shaxx only has one horn I thought
---
Now that title is just wholesome. :-)
---
Recharging knife isn't op, dont titans have a recharging melee? Dont forget you have hit a headshot to get that benefit
---
Me a main hunter, agrees that makes no sense here.
---
Damn. If we had dedicated servers we probably wouldn‚Äôt have this problem.
---
Do you not know how to use the knife? It's for mid air fights or when you're outgunned.
---
Can love bloom on the battlefield?
---
You know you can control when it explodes right?
---
Maybe on console the knife has aimbot but on pc you need to hit either on point or just off for it to count.
---
I‚Äôm confused. What is the difference??? It‚Äôs a picture either way. I swear reddit has some weird ass rules. But okay üëå.
---
Randy's Python and xeno with meltting point and peregrine greaves is nasty. Use Randy's for invading, and xeno for boss dps
---
*repost*
---
Might consider pulling tricksleeves from collections for the vanguard pinnacle grind
---
Sorry about that, I took a pretty long break from the game. I never played season 8.
---
Yupp
---
This? This doesn't seem like that throw required skill.
---
Except they do
---
I mean I just want to point out no one had an issue with the Arbalest or any LFR before this season
---
Honestly Martyr's is SO MUCH FUN 
---
#i love it
---
never played season 8, unfortunately :(
---
That‚Äôs buzzard right? Haven‚Äôt seen the pinnacle requirements yet, nor have I come across it in PvP
---
I‚Äôm completely the opposite. Been getting record (for me) kills and having a blast. Not using arbelest, either. I think the buff to sidearms has really gelled with my play style. Don‚Äôt worry, the spam will quiet down soon enough as everyone finishes their Komodo quest. Until then just stay out of lanes!
---
Current pvp is similar to an arbalest only version of momentum control.
---
I think the variks one is way worse
---
Bloody Mara....hehehehe
---
*RATED T FOR TEEN*
---
Yes a super aka the golden gun. If it was just a straight up gun fight it might of been another story...... Oh I just had a  thought what If the dredgen brought back yur using the sundil.
---
He's had centuries to practice his headbutting, just look at that wraparound move he pulled coming out of the Forest. If there wasn't an Eliksni phrase for "say syke right now," there will be after some Fallen see that footage.
---
Yes, but it‚Äôs much higher risk. Titans get killed from shotguns while trying to shoulder charge all the freaking time
---
Thank you for sharing your wisdom
---
I remember someone made one on xbox that said UCK BUNGIE with that emblem lol
---
Underrated comment
---
It's exactly the same as it has been besides adding a LFR quest. This is exactly what happened with revoker, it has nothing to do with being out of balance.
---
YEEEEEEEESSSSSSSS!!!!!
---
Ran it 3 times earlier, only completed once. It seemed like I was the only one throwing the charges. And my teammates were barely doing any damage to the boss.

Only had a full team of 3 the one time I completed. Other two runs someone left as soon as it started, and it never filled the spot with another player.

Honestly, if they somehow did it live. Probably a way to have captions/subtitles. Or if they added to it post production.

( Not sure if such a thing is available since I don't watch streamers )

Hmmmm I'll definitely look into it.

Game's been bugged to reset video settings every time you open it. Most of us aren't crashing from it, but it's not just you.

Solo Q for competitive is like a coin flip where each flip takes 15 minutes and you have to focus all of your attention on the coin the entire time.
