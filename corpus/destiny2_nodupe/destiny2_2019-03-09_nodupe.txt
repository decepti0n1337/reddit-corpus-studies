Well, I‚Äôm about to get off for the day. So it‚Äôll have to be tomorrow 
---
&gt;Runs great on pc.
---

---
Yep, destroyed it....
---
Cat.
---
So then stfu, dont be an asshole and do the fucking 40 matches.
---
God i hate people who do that. We get the meatball and youre fucking afk
---
Screw yo guys, I‚Äôm going home. 
---
i‚Äôve already gotten my meaty ball of loveliness 
---
Chaperone catalyst when?
---
i forgot how fucking salty the D2 community is lmao, bunch of cry babies 
---
Im not talking about you. Remember gambit is a TEAM game? Dont be an asshole, help your teammates out
---
Anybody else think this looked like a person wearing a hoodie?
---
&gt;The hell am i supposed to know he‚Äôs gonna pull blade barrage?
---
There are a lot of things, really. Run away from teammates, use cover, use heavy, use a super, run away or just don't engage.
---
&gt;What if i‚Äôm not facing him?
---
Then they outplayed you. Use the radar to watch for flankers, then kill them from an unexpected angle.
---
&gt;What if i just got my super? 
---
It's mayhem, just don't engage if you don't have your super. GG can kill from anywhere, you shouldn't need to be in blade barrage range.
---
&gt;Why don‚Äôt we just give blade barrage the same time to activate as golden gun?
---
It's actually fairly similar. Golden gun also preserves momentum, so you can use it while sliding, which makes you evasive while doing the animation. It's a panic super, it shouldn't have a long start lag.
---
&gt;As a hunter THAT USES BLADE BARRAGE I can fairly and unbiasedly say that blade barrage is still broken.
---
You sound pretty biased against it. It's a good super, but outside of mayhem it's bad. Poor neutral game for PvP, and given how OP roaming supers are it's a bad choice. It's seen so much just because it's the only panic super Hunters have.
---
Just git gud. 
---
Im pissed because when i was doing the 40 matches i had people lik3 you everygame
---
We all had to do the 40 matches. Toughen up and shut up
---
"Those of us who have gone up against us...and you know who you are..."
---
Ok but at a certain point you become the hater
---
Also let me see your tats. You got enough balls to hate on mine let‚Äôs see what you got my man 
---
Take a seat young Skywalker
---
It's a know bug, bungie knows about it and they said that they'll refresh the vendor every Sunday (starting this Sunday 10th), until the bug is fixed.
---
Good thing you have a sniper.

I have it on the two characters I didn't unlock the quest on, as well.
---
ONE STAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHMP
---
Yeah that's where I got it from Lol
---
ive gotten about 6 gambit helmets complete waste of time honestly 
---
The ghost has been weaponized just throw it at the enemy with a hard spin
---
Yeah i just wish i could make sense of the icon. Like it shows 4 different colors.... ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è is there a system?
---
Guys get the upvotes to 666
---
Thanks so much for the response!! I‚Äôll for sure do the adventures then, probably also a good way to ensure I don‚Äôt fall behind on power 
---
I know how to do it, but I never got anything from the drifter related so how does this link clear that up
---
There must be some sort of bug if you don't have the quest, unless you did it already.
---
No it wasn't don't listen. The problem people had was that you you hit someone twice in the head and leave them and they would die from a DoT. You hit a third time and kill them faster though. TLW on the other had a higher ROF and two tap without a DoT effect. 
---
You'd think they'd have implemented this in crucible by now
---
A bug is what I'd come to expect, so whatever I'll do it the annoying way
---
You're wrong, last word was much much stronger and easier to get. 
---
Contraverse hold is sweet on pvp, that damage reduction when u r charging means u can take a shotgun in the face, release and watch them melt as your grenade rips through them
---
It doesn‚Äôt even brick the console it requires you to mess with the hard drive. I‚Äôm saying destiny isn‚Äôt perfect and neither was anthem yet you assumed that anthem having a bug means destiny is free of criticism
---
I don't even think you can do it that way anymore...
---
This thing exists? Wtf????
---
Lastword was two tap? And the complain about thorn
---
I had to contact them via email but as you purchased an item on the site you get an emblem for in game an its sent to your email the system is lagging in sending the pdf code for them 
---
Implying mayhem has any skill about it
---
It‚Äôs still viable on a par-shot basis, but the ammo economy of the weapon has been reduced. 
---
Did it not send it to your postmaster? Usually unclaimed loot (even from unopened chests, at least for the Halloween event) goes there.
---
Subsistence perk? What‚Äôs the bonus?

this is the best meme about destiny i've seen in a long time

Well at least they look cool I guess 
---
Malfeasence, Erentil Fr4/Retold Tale, Hammerhead. 
---
Orpheus Rigs with top tree Nightstalker. 
---
That‚Äôs my loadout. 
---
It's really a shame the amount of people that straight up run when they see a super.
---
What happened
---
The armor sets rotate daily for some reason. Not sure how many different cosmetics there are in total for each suit
---
Snapshot sights, rampage. Not awful but not great honestly
---
Ikr, they can be scary, but they can be killed.
---
The annual pass was decided a while back so we don‚Äôt get dried out on content whilst they make their next major dlc. And the returning exotics are ones everyone asked for or are too legendary to not put in. Also they tie into the lore quite well so I guess it makes the story smoother. 
---
YESSSS
---
not for me
---
On top of spaghetti... All covered in cheese...
---
i need ophidian ascent in my life.  But I have no clue where the fuck xol is

Yeah, it‚Äôs the Farron Greatsword. Duh. 
---
Doesn't have enough magazine capacity
---
We know. 
---
Not sure where to post this question but since the website is mentioned here...
---
What do I have to do it get the braytech,org website to open in Firefox? It opens no problem in Chrome, but refuses to in Firefox. This is the error message I receive;
---
Error. I had trouble setting up the manifest data. You could try refreshing?  
---
OpenFailedError: InvalidStateError A mutation operation was attempted on a database that did not allow mutations.
---
I try refreshing as it suggests and I get the same results. Anyone have any ideas on how to fix this? I prefer Firefox over Chrome so I would really like to get this awesome website to open in it. 
---
Yes.
---
Thanks. I‚Äôm obviously not the original tweeter but I thought it was a good format to make it into these meme that is relevant to us lol.
---
That may *or may not* have been the reason for this post.....

Why do salty types like you always get carried away with the name calling etc anyway? I'm sorry that you can't afford a replacement console but that's not my fault. 
---
Whats that?
---
The first raid
---
[[Possible spoilers]] Probably an accident, as there‚Äôs going to be a quest line where we must choose between the Drifters side or the Vanguard 
---
bro first of all I own an xbox one x not a ps4 my console did not breakdown. what I didn't want to argue about anthem's quality. why don't you stay in school and make some friends.
---
It's not just you it is a known issue.

thanks, i can close this now
---
Lilac Bombast makes everything real pink, despite supposedly having green, black, and white show on the shade too.
---
&gt; what I didn't want to argue about was anthem's quality.
---
After I had literally just told you that I wasn't defending Anthem which is the exactly why I said it again. Thanks for proving me right you moron.
---
If you're going to waste more of your important time on me than at least do better than recycling my stuff, it's really weak.
---
Tbh Oathkeeper is bad too...I would have preferred St0mp-ee3.
---
This one is very good
---
You arent done the new cap is 700
---
Atm modifiers are bugged. Its a known issue. Don't know when fix is coming :/
---
I was hoping for St0mp-ee3 since they're due to show up again. Maybe next week, *sigh*
---
Same
---
We did solar burn, extinguish, momentum and match game. 
---
With the power increase to 110 
---
Should give you a x3 score multiple 
---
Same bro, same...
---
You will pretty much always want Extinguish, because if everyone dies it wastes so much time you will probably not get 100k. 
---
If you have teammates, match game is a good one. 
---
I like to set a singe that there is the least damage of in the nightfall, but you can also set it to the super and/or weapons you are using. 
---
Nightfall score handicap modifier has been greatly reduced. A power handicap of 0-100 does not increase the modifier at all, so if you aren't above 640 this will not help you at all. 
---
" It doesn't matter which one you enjoyed more, both have their flaws and both were due criticism because of them. It's still early days for Anthem and this circlejerk of hating on it is already boring. "
---
that really sounds like you're defending it.
---
this bug doesn't affect xbox. and I can send you a video of my xbox turning on if you want me to. I don't even own anthem on my xbox. judging by the way you talk you're a very bitter person that has no friends. and you are very insecure about how much money you have.

Jotunn clears out packed groups pretty good if you aim towards the center of the group.
---
I didn‚Äôt know it was a bug I just thought it was part of the new update 
---
I‚Äôll try that out and see if it works thanks for the response 
---
Yeah so I know you have trouble reading but for the third time, I wasn't defending Anthem. I said i was bored of the circle jerk already, I also clearly stated that it was due it's criticism.
---
I mean maybe you just don't understand the definition of defending rather than not being able to read entirely but that wouldn't explain all the other stupid things you said.
---
Points for trying in that last sentence but still very weak stuff, didn't expect much from you anyway.
---
So are we done here or did you have any more entertainment for me?
---
Yeah that makes sense I tried 140 and that was horrible but I‚Äôll probably do 110 with the other modifiers you mentioned thanks 
---
What? I think youre responding to the wrong guy bro. I deleted the post because i had the information i needed. Whats the problem?
---
Probably gonna get even more from the general public. 
---
you..?
---
Seriously? I just wanted Black Talon ffs
---
Also have this bug. What platform and class is everyone on? Could be a random bug or tied to something I‚Äôm a hunter on PS4 
---
I got that yesterday
---
The Alrighty lmao
---
He hada bounce. 
---
Did that very thing the first time I played. LOL!
---
What even hit you?
---
I was also thinking that we should use the darkness to defeat the darkness!
---
PvP or grinding strikes 
---
K thanks. üôè 
---
‚ÄúOh you want that damn ship? Not gonna happen!!‚Äù
---
Your grenade lit the fuse. Wooosh
---
I never said Destiny was free of criticism, the game has flaws and the game can be downright infuriating at times, I‚Äôm just saying that this post was a joke about Anthem corrupting and breaking consoles, and you responded as if Destiny had equivalent problems at launch, which it didn‚Äôt, that‚Äôs just an indisputable fact.
---
Even if we ignore the console bug, almost all reviewers of the game will say Anthem has less content than Destiny 2 did at launch, and having played the endgame of both Destiny 2 and Anthem at launch, I can confirm that. Anthem has 3 dungeons, Destiny had 6 on release, the endgame of Anthem consists of farming Tyrant Mine (a single dungeon, just ignore the other 2) and contracts, the endgame of Destiny consisted of random dungeons so you had variety, daily story missions, various free roam activities, daily bounties, weekly bounties, and weekly nightfall dungeons. Destiny‚Äôs first raid launched a week after release, Anthem‚Äôs first raid is being released a whole 3 months after release. 
---
Destiny‚Äôs endgame kept me around for about a month before I stopped playing, I just came back a little over a week ago, Anthem kept me for like a week. They are both looter shooters, the endgame is the most crucial part of the game, and Destiny 2 objectively had more endgame content on release than Anthem does, if you deny that then oh well, in that case then you‚Äôre just a blind fanboy who will defend Anthem regardless of anything me or anyone else says.
---
that was my first thought when i saw it also
---
In the second (but same titled) *Darth Vader* series, Palpatine brings Vader to a hanger bay, with the ship being worked on, and Vader has a *are you fucking kidding me, Palpatine!? I know Padme is dead, stop reminding me!* moment.
---
for what?
---
Oh i can bet you ill have more than a grain of salt when they lock it behind $10 of silver.
---
It still has the same total damage. They just brought it‚Äôs DPS down. Hell, it does more damage now with WoR and MP. It‚Äôs still really good
---
I am sure you won't be alone...
---
I love that comic. Hope they make more like it
---
It was more of a joke. Itll suck forsure but it wont be the end of the world. I aint spending as much as i paid for this dlc on one ship lol.
---
For reminding him that Reckoning is as exciting as watching paint dry
---
I've been getting 5 win streaks solo in gambit prime. I am also consistently getting over 50% damage as a geomag warlock, with Jotun, and crooked fang with boss spec. Leave the other half up to my team mates, and USUALLY it works out in my favor. Every now and then, my team mates just want to lose. I've had 4 stacks summon their prime first and still smash them
---
Huh. Maybe. Also on PS4, and my Hunter is the only one of the three that it still shows for. 
---
This is why you need to focus invader lmao. They are not even paying attention
---
Nope they weren‚Äôt they just kept walking into my crosshairs 
---
I regret making my character a blue prick that look like someone a stick up his ass!
---
&gt;since the last update
---
This new update is about 50% bug and 50% feature, and a lot of quests cannot be progressed right now. I think you are completely right that something is wrong. 
---
I only had the year one perks so they were the only thing I bought. 
---
Dunno if doubling down on the handcannon reload works but on paper it looks good XD
---
I'd imagine the drop rates being pretty low, considering you can get a weapon that's fully curated. Your best bet is to just keep playing. Use a fireteam medallion to increase your odds and pray to RNGesus that something drops. 
---
Yeah but they are bugged at the moment, only dropping a single light higher, was trying to figure out if any powerful rewards weren't bugged.
---
It's not a glitch, it remembered something urgent 
---
Thanks man, Think I‚Äôll check out some fighting games and finish off Dark Souls 3 to start. And wow that‚Äôs hella dedication. I lasted till WotLK.
---
I legit miss the Cosmodrome :(
---
The time has come, they are moving against us and we shall fight back instead of being quiet. Remember when they nerf us into the ground when we finally had s viable super, But hardly touch anything of the other classes and still keep the class viable? Eyes up warlock.  We was told the war was with the cabal on mars WRONG, The real war has already begun before we even realised. All the blade barrages and cancer blades. All of the one eyed mask titans had the privilege of being disgusting while the flush us down the toilet and expected us to be treated like this and not say anything? #WarlocksRiseUp #StopWarlockAbuse
---
Now that‚Äôs a cause for concern haha, well bad luck for me I guess! Thanks man! 
---
The game made it up to me by giving me the new exotic, it's pretty fun
---
Lol european bloody iphone 
---
 Did... did it come back? üò≤
---
Same, was such a cool place
---
Annual Pass has brought a lot of grinding (Black Armory forges), new raid and a lot of stuff to do around gambit so far (already worth the money imo).
---
Black Armory stuff starts at lvl 50 powerlvl 600, you could just play forsaken, grind the Dreaming City, play the Last Wish raid and you will probably have enough to do until the annual pass will be for sale again.
---
Nah, it's all in the lootpool. Maybe like 2-5 guns are exclusive
---
It was my first Souls game and i had a blast. The DLC's are awesome ^^.
---
Nice jump
---
One of the first times i didnt have any of the exotics xur has had. Oathkeepers were the only hunter exotic i needed

I thought this was going to be a post about year 1 armor.
---
I've heard good things about the Erentil
---
For me it's the God damn cyclops
---
But really, bungie lays some cheap ass kill shots on you.
---
I just happened to jump across a ravene and I looked up.
---
There was a vandal jumping across the ravene in the opposite direction directly over my head.
---
The vandel was aiming forward while in the air.
---
As he went over my head, with his weapon facing forward, I saw a shot come from his weapon at pretty much 90 degrees to single shot me with 10 motes on me.
---
Some of the cheap shots are laughable.
---
Getting shot behind rocks...it goes on and on
---
Oh dmn, i'm on PC.
---
DEJA VU!
---
Yeah, it is. I'm having the same issue and bungie spoke in their most recent TWAB about it I think.
---
Seems like a good problem to have...
---
is this ship behing thick wall of money or rng?
---
Actually got sunshot ghost yesterday. He is real
---
Why do we have to go through this every single update? 
---
Yes cyclops every time. You will just be starting to walk to the side of the map they‚Äôre on. And boom headshot. You couldn‚Äôt even see them. BUT THEY COULD SEE YOU. 
---
‚ÄúThe Best Offense‚Äù Triumph: We are investigating an issue where the Triumph ‚ÄúThe Best Offense,‚Äù which awards¬†Oxygen SR3, isn't counting the correct number of Orbs of Light generated in strike activities.
---
Nevermind. I found the issue. 
---
Indeed. The worst thing is that sometimes even Hydras do this and I've watched them fire about 40 times at once all in one huge burst and basically you're just dead say goodbye to everything you hold dear and accept your fate.

I mean, they are a giant eye.

Is that quest ever gonna come back? I want Thunderboi so fuckin bad but I didn't play on year 1 üò≠
---
one is wearing collector armor and has 15 motes  and the other has full invader armor and 0 motes
---
I got killed by a Hydra while banking, it was on the other side of the map.
---
Sure the first two aren‚Äôt from xur?
---
im having the same issue :/
---
INVADER ON THE FIELD!
---
Im gonna do that in the Reckoning when I put down a raid banner lol
---
You're already dead 
---
Ogres can be harsh, but enough hits on their crit spot and at least they‚Äôll be stunned and stop attacking for a couple seconds. Hydras just turn and rain purple death on you constantly.
---
Or an elemental melee, or firefly, or literally anything that burns it
---
Have you completed one? 
---
If you want to play a support role, top tree Nightstalker combined with the Orpheus Rig exotic is a great choice. Tether bosses/large groups of enemies and you will buff your and your allies‚Äô damage (kinetic, energy, and super) towards those targets. The Orpheus Rig will give you super energy back; this allows you to super more frequently and therefore generate numerous orbs for your allies.
---
For pure boss damage, use middle tree Gunslinger (or bottom tree with the Celestial Nighthawk exotic).
---
For staggering bosses or clearing waves of enemies, use any Arcstrider subclass with the Raiden Flux exotic. As far as I‚Äôm aware, the most efficient strategy vs. bosses is to use two light attacks then one heavy attack; rinse and repeat.
---
We need Monte Carlo back 
---
Yes , although you can earn the coins to buy that content 
---
That's dope!
---
Making this a relatively cheap MMO, if you consider it as a month to month cost. 
---
If you bought everything on launch, you'd have paid $170, making this a roughly $7 a month game with no buy in cost. That's unheard of. 
---
This game is in active development, and had server costs. Yes, they will charge for new content. Be glad there's no monthly fee on top of this. 
---
WoW and Final Fantasy 14 both charge between $40 and $60 for expansions every year, on top of $10-$15 a month in fees. I've spent thousands playing LotRO over the past 11 years. All of these games also have cash shops. 
---
While Destiny does have less content, it's much cheaper. That said, in the year and a half it's been out on PC, I've put in 410 hours. That beats my yearly average for LotRO by a bit. 
---
I kind of predicted this when MMO's started coming to console. That market was not ready to support active development costs. 
---
Sun chop - solar karate in a chip 
---
You‚Äôve blindly defended it while I‚Äôve told you reasons it wasn‚Äôt good. You‚Äôre only argument for anthem being bad is it messes with ps4 consoles and you once again, like I even said, ignored any criticism and immediately said ‚ÄúWaaah it‚Äôs Activisions fault not Bungies reee your a fan boy‚Äù
---
I attempted but was told there was an issue but the emblem does say 1 completed.
---
His icon doesn‚Äôt appear on the map anymore been that way for quite a while 
---
Let's also not forget their cross-mapping 2nd cousin the shreiker.
---
While path of exile do it for free with much more valuable content and story in a 3-month cycle.
---
What was the issue? 
---
Gjallarhorn is blown by Heimdall to signal the start of Ragnarok, it's a very important horn. I keep seeing a whole bunch of random names in Norse Mythology in Destiny which is awesome that they do that as well as use other names of mythology from different cultures throughout time.
---
He didn‚Äôt get the memo that being inactive like that won‚Äôt net you the end of match rewards
---
This was horribly low effort but ok
---
Oh
---
Oh..ok thx ..new player 
---
Nice. Ty.
---
Hit level 50 asap, then do the powerup bounties from the Drifter to hit 640. If you want a speedrun. 
---
Warmind is good. I'd play through it for the unlocks. 
---
Forsaken is where they fixed the game, though. You'll want to prioritize that. 
---
Nope mine has hair
---
GATlerhorn. I remember looking up a video on how to pronounce it as I always did so as YOWLerhorn, but someone native to the language that the word originates(?) from said it would be GATlerhorn and GALerhorn like literally everybody in the game and on the team say it
---
People are free to play what they like, or what fits their budget. 
---
MM has not changed. It's still pre-mades vs randos frequently. 
---
not a fan of the border, but the effect looks cool otherwise.
---
Gotcha. I‚Äôm interested in the story so I guess play through Warmind (does it have necessary exotics?) and Forsaken stories? 
---
Then whatever is left over do drifter to hit 640?
---
You need dredgen to *really* complete it 
---
This is all such good advice thank you so much‚Äî the exotic weapons (and the respective quests) are some of the things I‚Äôm most excited about. Should I start them all when I‚Äôm level 50 too?
---
My referral was not using the primary account of his ps4 or so I was told, not sure if that was the case or not (found the guy on earth).
---
*increase
---
Yes you need the annual pass, you can push to 640 by doing specific bounties via the drifter however be warned those bounties will make you play pvp...and as far as leveling up from that point it‚Äôs just doing the weekly milestones upon each weekly reset 
---
Not true. I have them. You should only use them on yellow bar mobs. Groups of them returns easily over 50% and killing large boss types is around 70%. In crucible mayhem killing a guardian with it instantly refreshes it. In regular crucible a double kill is 70%. It‚Äôs very good still just not insanely op. Add super mods to your gear and you have it up quite a bit. 
---
can you please read the perk again
---
I know. It's supposed to be a big bulky weapon that is slow to use. I simply made a typo.
---
Did you find your bird? :/
---
I want Ana bray's ship. She's way better than saint 14, change my mind.
---
i misunderstood, my apologies
---
I feel the same but about Scorpius turrets, the shoot so fast
---
I mean, half the early game ships are literally and obviously abandoned for a long time, or just cobbled together from scrap, I think you have bigger problems than aerodynamics.
---
What ship is this?!
---
I'm more of a complaining about boss stomp power man
---
Don‚Äôt diss my boi Snorri
---
There's a green set (Misfit, go firure etc) and a red set (right side of wrong, wrong side of right etc) of the tangled shore stuff. Hand Cannon, Pulse, Scout, Shotgun, Auto, SMG and GL for each. Terrain wind is the 'red' Grenade Launcher. There's also that bow you get off spider.. I've forgotten the name of.. Its 'green' counterpart is subtle calamity. 
---
Green drops everywhere, red is shore bounties, wanted enemies and heroic adventures. Wardens Law matches the 'red' set. Plus the red stuff is straight better.. Imo.
---
That adresses most of my concerns. Thanks!
---
your missing out. Try a rat king value fight and get back to me
---
Imagine solo player, so I dont have rat king, and I've never done a raid before
---
*jumps on the ground*
---
I'm geyyy
---
That's why I said to try it out on a raid and get back to me . My first statement doesn't change
---
You could get bright dust at launch though, I had like 1k not even a month after release, again you‚Äôre just making stuff up
---
When you have long dick and it slowly erect?
---
Sorry
---
I spent most I'd year 1 rocking Better Devils, Skyburner's Oath/Hard Light depending on the enemies, and Zenobia-D with tracking and cluster bombs
---
I did list those flaws maybe you should try reading them
---
I didnt have anything till just a few min ago that had rocket launcher reserves an all my gear is stated out for special ammo (fusion rifles) or lmg reserves  so lol i had 5 rounds to play with at a time did the killin left got more went in again 
---
Reeee i want toaster
---
One of them doesn't have a meme name.
---
I mainly play pve and gambit
---
What other modifiers do you have active? As of last week, the PL handicap has been changed substantially - Arc, HW and a handicap is no longer anywhere near a 3x multiplier, unless you accidentally set the handicap at like 150.
---
I don't like Gambit prime. We weren't able to get the primevil's health down at all even after trying to kill the witches for 10 minutes+ and hammering away at him. I dont get it

My two friends that I consistently play with are about to leave me for the Division 2. Send me your battle tag and I‚Äôll add you when I get home tonight. 
---
Dreaming City, in particular, has a crazy amount of opportunity for exploration. There's a lot of lore entries hidden around that you'll need to get if you want the Cursebreaker title. 
---
There are also an absurd amount of out-of-bounds breaks in that zone, if you're into that.
---
Corporate needs you to find the difference between these two pictures 
---
*Imma women's man, no time to talk.*
---
So much this! Love the Greek/Roman themes on Mars too!
---
Watch strats
---
Scout rifles, hand cannons. No Land Beyond. 
---
I still use Sweet Business sometimes, just because I can.
---
No one, your hating on my tribute tat 
---
That's why I'm going Collector first lol
---
Starting to see it now?
---
not sure why everyone here hates titans but skating is still viable
---
Grenade&gt;bow&gt;run in before the corpse explodes. 
---
Both are really good snipers. In my opinion thilight oath is better in pvp but the long goodbye is better in pve
---
No worries happy hunting 
---
Not yet
---
Uncle Drifter lets me play with all the cool guns! 
---
I got some kind of achievement for doing something in private matches but I‚Äôve never played one 
---
Yea I get the point that your better off at being a smart ass on the internet because your protected. If your in the Houston area we could meet up right now and I will literally beat your ass and when I‚Äôm done I‚Äôll lay my nuts on your forehead and you wouldn‚Äôt be able to do anything about it. I‚Äôll give you the ol Texas teabag and have my ping pong chin smiling in a selfie while doing so.
---
the point is its a more team oriented gambit so if the other 3 jackasses are dancing at the portal you are kind of fucked
---
You have to buy it while in the game. You open up the director and in the upper right hand corner it will say season 6. You click on that and it will give you the option to purchase the annual pass.
---
It's a random drop from any crucible match, so you just gotta keep playing till you get the quest
---
This is just great, I remember seeing the original and thinking it couldn't get better... I was wrong, so wrong.
---
Ahh ok, that makes sense. Thank you very much!
---
Oh i is big stupid 
---
I did it too
---
Appreciate the help
---
&gt; This new update is about 50% bug and 50% feature, and a lot of quests cannot be progressed right now. I think you are completely right that something is wrong. 
---
Your comment put me to thinking, so I went and asked around some of my D2 playing friends, and their associated gaming groups, and a lot of people are having similar issues. Yeah, turns out that I may indeed suck at crucible, but I'm definitely experiencing a bug, so are a bunch of other folks. 
---
I must admit, that does actually make it a little better. At least I know it's not (entirely) my fault now, and I'm getting screwed by something that's not in my control, but hopefully will be fixed soon.
---
Prism doesn't affect incoming damage. 
---
One of the worst pictures I have ever seen.
---
Jokers wild invader set with the iron banner helmet
---
My schools  name was Heimdal and Gjallarhorn was actually name of our school newspaper
---
Thx
---
Nice one, but maybe you should fix your camera focus. 
---
No problem, I couldn‚Äôt figure it out at first either
---
You know what? I‚Äôm gonna say it, I like playing Battlefront 2
---
Would you say it‚Äôs better than breakneck?
---
Ur bad lol rekt
---
I don't...yet.
---
I can make one next time I get it though.
---
Xur do you not like werlocks?
---
Agreed
---
Multiply by 2 
---
A quad barrel
---
...
---
Seppuku? 
---
Harakiri?
---
Or intentional?
---
Enemies. Not enimies
---
What
---
Sudoku
---
Cheers mate.
---
Just dont play reckoning on Glass burn. It is so stupid that they included it.
---
So intentional
---
Gotchya
---
Wanted to make sure you didnt think it was actually called sudoku
---
More power to ya tho
---
Mush love
---
I'm miffed about Titan Skating going away because other than Titanfall 2, I can't find a game that let's me go at the speed of sound murdering doods.
---
I was half expecting it to return in vanilla with it being made to kill cabal
---
I couldn‚Äôt even tell wtf that was for a second 
---
What is the other perk other than rampage?
---
I love this üòÇ
---
Subsistence: kills partially reload the magazine from reserves, but reserve capacity is reduced. Just imagine the Huckleberry but as an Auto rifle. 
---
You paid for the forsaken expansion but not for the annual pass and the content it comes with so naturally you'd have to pay for that as well
---
Still waiting for decent scout rifle buff in pve. How does a RIFLE has less range and damage then hand cannons? I was so disappointed when I got my oxygen sr3 yesterday. The numbers are just stupid. Auto rifles does more damage then them.
---
‚ÄúWhatd you see?‚Äù
---
‚ÄúEh, just the same old crap i see every time i close my eyes.‚Äù
---
Hey thats me :D
---
Actually really appreciate you giving proper credits, hat tip to you sir.
---
I mean, you didn't pay for it. You bought Destiny 2: Forsaken. If you look at the official Destiny 2 website it says clearly that you need the pass.
---
Eververse sold old emotes once in forsaken for silver and they were different colors from the original 
---
Lol im trying to think of an instance where this isnt true but i cant
---
How? Shortening or lengthening space bar delay?
---
Simple Ana Bray while being a bad ass in her own right NEVER come close to achieving what saint 14 did. He dismantled the fallen houses to the point of them fleeing to the fathest parts of the solar system. He HEAD BUTTED A FALLEN KELL TOO DEATH WITH ONE HEAD BUTT and he did this while the dam thing was strangling him. Then right after killing the last fallen Kell saint 14 called the speaker to tell him and the speaker told saint 14 that Osiris had been seen on murcury. WITH OUT A SECOND THOUGHT OR EVEN RESTING Saint 14 rushed to murcury and entered the infinite forest. Where He killed billions of vex he killed so many vex that they created a vex mind SPECIFICLY to drain his light and lock it away. I'm sorry my dude, even though Ana Bray is a badass. She can't even hold a candle to Saint 14.
---
A titan that didn‚Äôt shotgun or shoulder charge you I don‚Äôt believe it lol
---
Where is it 29.99 at? I've seen 39.99 almost every where I've looked 
---
I want this ghost so bad, he just looks so cute
---
Were you falling as you took this picture? XD
---
*Finally gets Oxygen SR3*
---
*Trips taking picture*
---
WORTH
---
Drifter has catch up bounties to get you to 640. Grab those 
---
don't forget Sunshot!
---
Yeah, one that isn't just useful with clanmates.
---
My Chattering Bone is godly. I have nearly 10k kills with it. Rampage/Outlaw/AP rounds and range masterwork.
---
You hit him with the classic ‚ÄúNo u‚Äù
---
Are they still good against the primeval? MGs got a nerf against bosses this patch, so I‚Äôve been running wardcliff instead. 
---
Agree. And the only ones who are worse are the ones who tell peiple how to play.
---
They're downvoting for the hell of it.  Neither one of us said anything that was fictitious or illogical. I honestly believe that everyone who downvoted simply have Bungie's dicks in the mouths and don't want to accept that Bungie is an idiot company that makes stupid decisions all the time.
---
They‚Äôre ok. They‚Äôre waaaaayyyy better in PVP tho
---
First thing I thought was it looked like an SR-71 Blackbird, a lot closer than Nebula ship. That‚Äôs why I want it.
---
Yes this new gambit prime and reckoning is no joke, but keep on the look out I think during the season of drifter they gonna have a day when everyone gonna be able to do everything. 
---
Titanfall 2 is a superior fps and then we have a game that everyone is playing only because "battle royale". Brings nothing new to the table.
---
Same man! I got it yesterday and I‚Äôm in love
---
Are you also completing Nightfalls and Raids? Big power ups in those
---
Almost always max LL or slightly below (~50 PL)
---
What is the context of this picture/video?
---
Were you having a stroke mid picture? 
---
His pauldrons make him tallest
---
Is that Yu-Gi-Oh? Are the numbers their health? I would guess that in combination those 5 cards do a lot of damage. Never heard anything about it, just guessing.
