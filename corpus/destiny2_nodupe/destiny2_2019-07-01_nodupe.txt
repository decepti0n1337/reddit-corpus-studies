&gt;When you’re receiving an Exotic, we will take into account all Exotics you’ve found, and weight them against Exotics you have yet to acquire; this lowers the chances of receiving Exotics you already own  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Exotics that you do not yet own will be individually weighted much higher than duplicate Exotics.  
---
&gt;When receiving duplicate Exotics, you will be more likely to earn armor pieces, as they have randomly rolled perks
---

---
Of course they don't give us quantitative descriptions, because they're Bungie, but that would imply fairly significant protection against duplicates.  
---
What they need is an additional layer of "bad luck prevention".  I.E. if your past 10 exotics have been dupes then cut a guardian a fucking break already.  
---
This is exceptionally frustrating as a PvP player when the the new exotics are top tier meta items.
---
---
---
sometimes the game takes a long long time to load, it might be a good idea to just exit the search and re search
---
You assume I have a relationship...
---
Or friends...
---
Nobody’s disagreeing with you though?
---
“Still no 1K voices” is the last panel.
---
You said that Erentil isn’t a problem because of Recluse.
---
I think you meant to respond to the other dude. I’m on your side lol. About 16 exotics before I got Kepri’s Sting this Season
---
i never thought to stick the tether on the roof. thanks for that
---
Yeah so my warlock is Asian (male) and my hunter is awoken (female) so technically I could be reincarnated as either of them... sounds like fun, either I can fucking jump around everywhere or I can be gey and float around so idk if it’s a win win? Or a win, lose?
---
Omnigul is still single!
---
Thats monochromatic. I ise it on my titan.
---
Warlock (Asian male human) and hunter (awoken female)
---
Nice heads up play! Good job
---
No I mean irl
---
F
---
Im litteraly level capped 30 power like 310 something and havent seen a single bow
---
Ah whoops, I tacked that on to support what you were saying.  Didn't mean for it to come across as countering your point haha.  Now we have 2 data points for a 90%+ dupe rate.
---
Moons haunted
---
You can't get bows until Forsaken. That might be why.
---
FUSION GANG
---
Ahhhh white male... lmao I’m dumb af
---
I said FOR ME. Doesn’t mean it isn’t problem for others lol
---
Yea i want the dlc but cant afford it lmao
---
Ahhh! In that case, given human lifespan during the golden age, you certainly could have moved to a different region and then developed characteristics of that region over your 300 years.
---
Nah bro, it’s the sword logic
---
whats that on your hip?
---
But Fusion Rifles are a Recluse counter, not the other way around, anyone playing smart with a Fusion won’t let get close. Especially with Backup Plan.
---
Nah, she said she was too caught up in her career, and she said she was seeing someone tentatively
---
Damn. Lots of butthurt last word users here
---
Another one of moira’s memes taken to reddit
---
thanks
---
Reading the title I had a firefly flashback
---
In a nutshell get better internet connection if possible. Otherwise just stick to pve and you wont get banned.
---
Take my upvote and go
---
Why do I feel uneasy looking at this
---
Precisely this
---
A Flag on Meltdown is an automatic win
---
I'm glad it's a HC because then I can actually use it in crucible
---
finally a relatable one *sad upvote*
---
Yes
---
Menagerie says you can have a new helmet if you so choose
---
*”Did I just get Nighthawked?”*
---
&gt; it may not be 50 meters
---
Lmao but you were so sure
---
Well I hope you learned your lesson!
---
Show me something I've never seen before?
---
Do you help getting up to fabled ?
---
Lmao you got me oh my god how will I ever go on with my life..... gtfo kid lol
---
Oh
---
Neither do I. Watched the stream, trailers, vidoc, and I still don’t see any comedic value in the phrase
---
Do you ever look at this sub?
---
The search bar is your friend
---
Bungie knows, friend. They’re going to hand out an emblem for playing iron banner while it was broken like this. “I survived LoW and all I got was a lousy t-shirt”
---

*laughs in console*
---
What’s the ska dancing emote called?
---
Can someone explain to me where this “moons haunted” came from? (SORRY IM NEW TO THE GAME)
---
Jump
---
F MEGA!
---
U can change character and load back up, should work after.
---
I guess VOG was your...

---
My raid team was using swords in crown.  Specifically the first phase of the boss fight.  They are capable of some insane damage outputs.   I think if the ammo capacity was higher they would be in a better place.  
---
Side note: they are pretty nice in gambit for dealing with blockers (atleast the roll i have is).
---
No problem!
---
My partner and I have a clan called Cult of Andromeda. Very friendly people! We are smaller though and not an 'organized' clan that plans events and makes schedules but we're chill, nerdy and very positive. Basically just a bunch of friends playing games and doing what we can together when we have the time. We might not be the clan for you if you want something more structured but give us a look (:
---
I have a Bygones with outlaw and rampage masterworked for reload. Just do Gambit or Gambit weapon frames from Ada I’ve gotten at least 15 of them to drop between the two. It’s my go to primary until I got Astringer. I’ll be using that bad boy for a while now.

Is it possible to learn this power?

Me grinding for the Collector set for Reckoner.
---
Free enhancement cores
---
You are misinterpreting. I made a statement and you participated. You said you had no problem raising your resilience, and then you get defensive when I asked what it was. Sure k/d is relevant when were talking about survivability. You're acting like I'm trying to compare destiny to Tetris.
---
I’m talking about pvp (competitive, quick play, etc) yeah they do fine in pve. bungie could balance guns separately for pvp and pve too
---
I'd say buy forsaken. The story content alone is almost worth the cost IMO
---
Rat king cuts it **way** closer than grenade launchers do, that's why I put outrageous fortune/acantha-D in the same category as swarm and do not consider swarm separately. With any of those grenade launchers and tractor cannon, you can very quickly and easily one phase Galhran. With other things that technically work, such a rat king and outbreak perfected, it does work, yes, but it takes noticeably longer and cuts it a lot closer  to the limit of not being able to one phase.
---
I don't get offended by people that act like children, but I will correct them.
---
PC is a much smoother game but playing with friends is great. Wish there was cross play
---
Hayato
---
You made that statement responding to me though, go look. Seriously
---
Destiny has never been better change my mind
---
I'm a bit confused on the DLC.  I have everything up to Forsaken.   I don't have the annual pass.  
---
If I pre-order Shadowkeeper will it grant me access to the Annual Pass content that is current right now?
---
Thanks to you, i'm now doing that from this point on.
---
That exo looks exactly like my Titan and that threw me off for a sec
---
It's more of the praxic order being the real problem, not necessarily the vanguard.
---
What?
---
You need to wager motes, amd win
---
The Annual Pass includes everything *between* Forsaken and Shadowkeep.  Black Armory, the Drifter stuff, etc.
---
[It's on sale right now, at least for Xbox (not sure about other platforms).](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/destiny-2-forsaken-annual-pass/c2ckz01457cz)
---
Yes I would. RL are for direct impacts, a sword with 6 ammo is potentially 6 kills. Not to mention swords are weapons without ammo too.
---
Your preference on weapons will differ to that of others, that doesn't make any weapon type inherently good or bad.
---
Maybe they just want to know what it is about them that you miss?
---
Someone being dead doesn't necessarily mean they're missed.
---
*He doesn’t get transfer but gets orders to VIP guard Ikora - the most uninteresting woman in the world.
---
its because while the perks now are decent, they used to be 1000x better in d1, and it doesnt even do anything remotely similar to what it did in d1, which is wierd, why not just make a new exotic for these new abilities?
---
Yes. Your peak glory of the season is what the quests will track. So if you hit fabled and dropped to guardian 1 it will still count you as reaching fabled.
---
Trinity ghouls is my favorite crucible weapon period just so much fun
---
We should have friendly fallsn dregs
---
Gimme Voidfang Vestments
---
nice.
---
Damn, beat me to it
---
Haha
---
Just use recluse you 4head
---
Yea seems about right. As I said unter my post, the Thralls are evil. So yea, nicely done and thanks.
---
I’m about 30% of the way to my Mountaintop. Slowly but surely I will get there
---
Oryx is a round boi
---
This is what I’m doing. Works wonders
---
It’s wasn’t even an attempt to woosh yet op still managed to fall for it.
---
But...that's on titan.
---
Yes its how i used to go hudless for screen shots pre forsaken but now i just use the rapid weapon switch method. 
---
I haven't used this since warmind.
---
you i love you
---
Yes, but I see no logic behind this. Prolly just a bug.
---
I haven't ran into almost any lately
---
Not a glitch, intentional game design.
---
Can you explain the lore behind this? Would love to know the details.
---
I respect a person who believes Last Word is the most dominant PvP exotic weapon...
---
And that’s how you clip into the back rooms. Gotta be more careful than that
---
Woah do you do requests? I’d love to see my guardian drawn by you!
---
Aaand that's rhe Truth.
---
Idk what this is or what’s it’s from but I love it
---
Man I was really looking forward to run around the crucible with an invisible golden gun with these
---
One that feels like it? Probably not. Malfeasance's stability is quite unique. I love it too for that but the trade off is more headshots compared to other hand cannons to kill.
---
And don't forget the sound effects when you fire the weapon. Nothing quite like it. ☺️
---
We're not scared of Cayde, yeah, but of him coming back only for us to have to put him back down? You bet I'm afraid of that :(
---
What convention?
---
Currently in the 30s range on LS...starting to panic a little, not gonna lie. That's what I get for wanting to infuse max LL on multiple loadouts.
---
True
---
Proelium FR3
---
I have all except NF and IMO everyone should get them. Its a game. This quests are too hard. I nearly cried while doing the Mountain Top Quest. Its beyond frustrating.
---
They're all acquired the same way.
---
Yah never heard of it, all I know in the crucible is fr4, and wizards, amything that isn't max impact is meh, doesn't have that one zoop across map potential. But whinners be crying, I had a guy tell me sweet buisness in rumble is exploiting.
---
I used fighting lion and a heavy launcher for most of it. I recommend quick access sling for any legendary single shot launchers in order to swap very quickly after shooting. 
---
If you play warlock then you can use lunafactions with a rift.
---
If you play Hunter, reload dodge with tether to chain kills
---
Titans can use rally barricades.
---
As for using launchers, make sure you utilise the hold and release mechanic to detonate them near someone if you don't think you'll one shot them. 
---
Other than that, I don't really have any more advice
---
Good luck
---
!remindme September 16
---
New sub-class; the photoshopper
---
Not to burst your bubble but this has been known for a good while
---
These all sound fine except Ashen Wake. Stickies are fine as is, I main them on Titan and warlock and can easily get kills with them. Making them one shot and explode instantly would just be a one shot throwing knife with tracking
---
You're missing the guy that crouches repeatedly for no damn reason (which is me by the way)
---
well yea. i am getting into the game again. me and my friend were doing izanagi and that boi was going full speed with solar burn on
---
Proelium gang
---
Bruh fosaken for me on ps4 is 1000 € so shut up
---
Is that no Mountaintop I see?! 
---
Me too man its rough...
---
I have the game on Battlenet, never played it. Now after the split i am interested to play it on another platform like steam with my friends.
---
Good stuff
---
You havn't seen the invaders special truth, boi are you lucky.
---
good thing Cayde's dead
---
What a div i am
---
*Loads gun* Moons hauted
---
^^He deserves gold
---
What’s the armor set in the right?
---
erentil isn’t max impact though..
---
U need to do the plates or wipe
---
People are toxic bro
---
Listen, none of the other subclasses matter. 
---
All you need is melting point.
---
Get the bounties from Banshee
---
I didn't know Pink Power Ranger was a guardian.
---
Thanks man I’m just struggling to get it as I just get bad team mates and keep losing matches
---
Man Cayde is pretty spooky. Ain’t I right lads?
---
Additionally, you get 21 (assuming you have 3 characters) from Hawthorn per week for getting clan XP.
---
And 3 per day from Spider for 70 shards.
---
Your kd doesn’t mean crap in this game, unless you only play rumble and 1v1? Your kda will always be more accurate. 
---
I have NF and I have a .99 kd. 
---
Be a team player and any comp team will succeed.
---
You don't. It's not meta and therefore not very useful. Chaos Reach works best when ads are condensed due to it's poor handling and the fact that your Warlock and the beam will cover 50% of the view-able scene. 
---
It's not ideal. The melee-ability is, however. Very unfortunate.
---
Calus demands you eat worthier veggies...
---
I’m at 17... mom come pick me up I’m scared
---
Yes you'll get it if you make the account that has the annual pass the primary ps4
---
How is this possible on console?
---
Licenses dont transfer, you essentially pick one account to be your main account and get whats on your characters already  and collections
---
Probably a Steely Dan reference or something
---
Truly
---
No...but kinda yeah...i mean ypu easily can look shit as a Warlock and with Titans and Hunters you can't really do anything wrong ^^'. I did choose a Human male. 
---
I mean there are a lot of bad looking robes in the game. The only ones i deem "cool looking" are Forsaken Baron specifiqe, Forge, Vanguard with the shoulder pauldron. But that's my taste :). 
---
But nothing compares to my D1 Warlock that guy was lit :(.
---
Easy for me, ive always gone the "Magic" class in any rpg or adventure/action game that has them, glass cannon is just my prefered playstyle. When i fired up D1 on day 1 the whole scholar thing instantly hit me, 5 years later and im still rocking the same toon. Dont care if they're the best or worst class, I'll always be a space wizard at heart.
---
Yeah it's my favorite sitting/waiting emote there is. It's also good for salt farming in the Crucible
---
I think it would have been better if they reintroduced Sunsinger with the perk to lower everyone's cooldowns near you, Well replaces Bubble.
---
It was Tree of Probabilities Wanted Cabal right before the boss. I got my nephews Slide Shot Snap Shot from him. He will drop the best DRBs in game. The EDZ wanted by winding cove seems to be less frequent than it once was. Mars lost sector  by Braytech will drop regularly but I have not had a good experience with getting anything amazing. However I am almost certain runes two and three mater. Obviously blue for DRB slot 2 Green Slot 3. I tried the same combination on about 20. Field Prep and Snap Shot weren’t R&amp;G it was too consistent. I am at the conclusion there is method to the madness. 🤔
---
You can't "get rid of" a perk,  just switch to a different tree
---
&gt; I feel like the robe Warlocks have looks way better than the cape hunters get !
---
Blasphemer!
---
Though, as a Hunter main, I envy some of the cool headgear the 'Locks get to sport.
---
Its really just a shutdown super i would never use it to be aggressive
---
Neither will I
---
The one guardian rocking wormhusk bothered me lol get with the group guy or gal
---
So join a better clan
---
Awoke
---
Isnt it seperate from steam and other platforms?
---
Anarchy Mountaintop club or broke
---
Congratulations guardian! 
---
"Now Let them burn in your light."
---
-Shaxx-
---
It says that's a pre-order tho. Unless it's a pre-order for the dlc but I'm able to play the base game before September 17th?
---
Nope, just wait. Don’t bother buying the 18-19 season pass. Skip this last year of content and jump in with Shadowkeep. The last year isn’t much more than a few weapon grinds. Just watch Byf’s lore videos to catch up with story content and cut scenes.
---
Looks like she's from Steven universe or something.
---
Lmao I switched it back on a second too early🤣 to be fair my teammates and plenty in the original post already berated me for it.
---
But I'll still be behind LL, should I just hard ass myself trough Shadowkeep with lower LL?
---
All platforms will be separate. It’s only cross save.
---
I mean we all probably do but new people really don’t come to Reddit
---
What is happening
---
Whereabouts in the website I cant find
---
I know this feel. Was on a 5 streak. Joined a match in progress. Managed to reach the banking area and the match was over.
---
did you? throw? enough? grenades???
---
XD
---
I mean I’m gay for Mithrax so
---
Why this tiny stupid warlock using some stupid stick to punch this tiny little ball. Just PUNCH the ball with you hands. Just PUNCH the ball. JUST PUNCH.
---
You mean crystals or triangles on the middle-left side of the screen?
---
Lol I apologized
---
Only with spike based and tractor cannon tho otherwise DPS isn't that much better
---
But 1) obviously spike nade hence why i said spike swarm. 2) the damage comparison is without tractor. Spike swarm &gt; wendigo no matter what after 8 wendigo shots. Tractor just makes it even better. And it doesnt matter. Higher dps is still higher dps.
---
Triangles. Looks like upside down pyramids
---
Bro a little tip is to slide into your shotgun shot
---
It lowers your hit box and gets you closer to your target for a one hit kill
---
Destiny right now is at its greatest point for any player. Recent or veteran. And especially in the fall when shadowkeep launches if even half of the vidoc is true!
---
Vex-modified ACD/0 Feedback Fence
---
I agree, and I try to avoid grinding things bc I'll burn out. Chasing the meta is like chasing your tail. You might catch it for a minute but then it moves again.
---
I did not know that
---
This guy here has you pretty well covered I would just add that spider has a weekly bounty that will net you a powerful drop and also don't overlook regular menagerie as it will net you 1-3 powerful drops of your choice each week depending on your chalice upgrades. (Power and efficiency in the bottom right corner when inspecting it)
---
So, it's pretty much the base D2 game, plus all Y1 dlc (WARMIND, orsiris, etc) for free.
---
More like a McDonald's employee with Blender on his laptop.
---
Yeah i get it too if people want a powerful weapon so do i.  But what I’m ranting about is the journey for that powerful weapon. Mayhem is fine its a crucible game-mode and it takes longer in casual modes. Comp grants you the most progress. And yh it is torturous but thats what it should be for a pinnacle weapon.
---
This
---
**para***causally
---
Hmm, I saw something about clans and the rewards from being in one on a YouTube video and will definitely look around and see the different ones
---
Also.. this lmao
---
What if we're scared of forgetting him, letting him go (accepting his death and moving on)  and thus we see him on the moon again?
---
Honestly though. I just got my hunter through the Forsaken campaign a few days ago, because I only started him a few weeks ago. me trying to heroicize a cryo pod before the boss gets melted is like a challenge by itself.
---
I get the fact it burns people out but thats why its a grind. I don’t like grinding but if i have to to get a powerful weapon i’ll do it
---
Kids' parents' money*
---
Well I guess I am right in the end. It was removed as a low effort rant. Not my fault you can't follow the rules when posting.
---
I want a tracking emblem for killing them
---
Whats the emote you used.
---
Its a shame on console the FOV is so low that there's barely any room for anyone else to fit in the picture
---
Go to the sweeper bot in the tower, in the annex
---
CA CA CAW CA CA CAW
---
Fears don't necessarily come from a place of just "this thing might kill me". We could fear dealing with his memory because we feel guilty that we didn't do enough. We fear, in a small way, that it's somehow our fault. So maybe, just maybe, Bungie will absolutely gut us and make us kill him.
---
A man of culture I see.
---
No one here cares.
---
Honestly it would be genius if they did so. I’ve never felt anything when killing any boss but uldren. But if we had to face cayde, whooo I would have some real sad boi hours
---
YEET
---
I mean there aren't tons of options. You can try different guns but there isn't anything else you can change. Armor makes no difference, subclasses make no different.
---
Definately forgot about Spider Wanted for power gear (he also has 6 other for enhancement cores that are worth the effort).  
---
Once they get the 690 gear, then yes menagerie would be a viable option for 3 more power gear.  And until July 9th you can farm the end chest with a single run to get all three.
---
For someone trying to level right now...I would suggest doing all activies other than 2 forge weapons and menagerie first.  Since you can choose your reward in those, I would do them last and choose ones that help most (lowest light spots).
---
Sounds good! I’ll be sure to hit you up.
---
It's still going to take you a definite number of weeks cause one of the lore drops is only from Mara's chest on week three. If you don't have those that's how long it will take you (this was my last week for Mara so now I'm rocking the title) otherwise I did the rest alone. Never found them too difficult to get.
---
We know. Its on the roadmap from the start of the season.
---
If it means I’m calculus’ chosen, yes.
---
You defeniatly have to have the Dreaming City unlocked to do the quest for Benedict.
---
Ignore the guy below me. He’s asshurt all the time for no reason and likes to take it out on other people
---
You have to beat the Forsaken storyline to access the annual pass content on each character.
---
Fuckin hell, there was a roadmap?
---
I've missed so much.
---
There are penalties but they don't activate often enough. I've only seen it once and it's because my fireteam member lagged out after lagging out like 4 other games. I think it should ban you from comp for 15 mins if you leave a game just like in siege
---
Don’t know if you have to do Osiris and warmind but they are good to do for good exotic quests like sleeper stimulant, Polaris lance, and all the prophecy weapons.
---
*Guardian down!*
---
https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/47840
---
Yup.
---
Bruh how
---
Clan name: Pure   
---
Go ahead and join, we have an open list.   
---
Or DM me and I'll give you my GT if you have any questions.
---
All the people downvoting....why are you booing him, he’s right
---
Mithrax says happy pride
---
&gt; Reports: This is spam (1)
---
Meh, IDK. This treads a fine line. I deem it stays but i won't object if the other mods want this down. For now, this post stays up.
---
I've gotten both the Astrocyte Verse and Peregrene Greeves. I've gotten plenty of duplicates too, but that's just because I Kephri's sting is now my only missing exotic besides Tarrabah. Exotics are supposed to be rare, you'll get it in due time. Make sure you do all your powerfuls for your best chances.
---
"let me sum up the entire game. Follow arrow, hold left click and keep mouse at headshot level, press E occasionally. No trading, pre determined loot that's locked behind a timewall (no surprise loot or rare loot just milestones you have to hit). zero strategic decision importance as far as character set up, you only have to count the number and make it big. Trash."
---
You can also make the point that hunters are disadvantaged by a lack of one-hit kills in PvP. Titans have Shoulder Charge and Warlocks have Handheld Supernova. And I'm sure there's some aspect Warlocks are disadvantaged of as well in regards to Titans and Hunters. I cannot argue that Titans as a whole have been a neglected class, especially in PvE. Hopefully the advent Shadowkeep solves these problems!
---
Well that’s good, still funny lol
---
I wonder if that’s healing or super energy?
---
Amen!
---
i know this message wasn’t directed towards me, but im interested in joining an active clan. would you dm me the details too?
---
Awesome. Thanks man
---
So in the heroic do you fail if you dont complete an encounter because I want to go get the flawless or whatever and the sword for shadow but I'm not quite sure I'm steady enough to do that kinda thing
---
So yeah your problem is with video games having to be played, try a different source of media
---
Know those feels. My clan is the same way. Kinda small. Keep to ourselves. We haven't got a clan banner poll since season 2 😭.
---
Heal+Weapon damage Buff
---
All mine are awoken, main warlock
---
Dang dude PC is toxic I actually get compliments on xbox about my sniping how the turn tables my dude
---
Because the clan system has 100 slots for a reason and all clans are capped to max 100K XP a week which is completely fair.
---
You can't really complain.
---
it says right there in the trailer that they heal and buff allies.
---
Just name it “gay maker” and whoever ends up dead to it is now gay.
---
Took me 10 or 15 tries.
---
Nah I have games that are good, just don't think this one is
---
He didn't make contact. It's a seriously annoying issue, half the time the charge lunges but won't connect. He'll still have his ability since it didn't touch you and rather pushed you back in the attempt.
---
As a titan main and a person that has gone up against enough to last a life time,striker titans biggest weakness is backpedaling
---
Neck beards gotta neck beard man. Report them for soliciting
---
Just play the game, man. Leveling will come naturally and asking the same old "which is better?" question will always get you subjective answers. 
---
Find what best fits your playstyle and operate from there.
---
But there's another annual pass that covers the next year that comes with the deluxe edition. That's why I want it.
---
When in doubt, crucible it out!
---
[deleted]
---
But here’s the thing.
---
*we Titans give no effs*
---
So just hip fire...the entire time...should have used last word instead, would have gone faster 😂😂
---
Missed chance to say "hope in your eye"
---
Just have fun! Play through the activities and you’ll level pretty consistently
---
i love math
---
I went inactive long after my clan died but my excuse is life and its "joys" Probably some of them as well. Long story I could use a clan too. Suggestions anyone? I am Not a great player, never raided, and am scared to meet new people.
---
Dude you probably don’t remember this comment, but you fucking called it
---
Let's hope!! ♥️
---
As a fellow titan, we gangsta until another class pops their supers and obliterates us
---
ok so the guy, shot me, then in less then a  second changed his weapon and killed the guy behind me. ok.
---
Well you didn't give the circumstances. If that's what happened then they might be hacking.
---
Are you complaining about people cheesing mountaintop while you cheesed windingo?! The fuck?
---
Is it worth getting back into right now? I had it at launch and played for 50 hours or so.
---
OH... YOURE APPROACHING ME?!?!
---
Ok... but have you seen his fat ass??
---
I need someone to do this for me on PC for a couple weeks... I haven't played since I first got the weapon.
---
Y'all acting like some warlock looking ass didn't just wipe your whole team three times in the same super
---
Not yet, still the same.  Otherwise I would use it.
---
YES. The Menagerie, as well as it's "Choose your own drops" mechanic, is phenomenal.
---
or.... you know..... could be The a Devil You Know with a *paint job*.

GG Guardian
---
Oh god
---
They did
---
Just hit E when you go into the map and do whatever it tells you to for now. That should get you through the campaign. If you aren't high enough level to do the next part of the campaign then try some other stuff like the public events, patrols etc.
---
"great state" is all relative.  A lot of people believe the game has been in a good state since Forsaken.  
---
Everyone has an opinion though.  Some people still think Anthem is good.  All 3 of those people will shut you down as soon as you talk trash on it.  It was good for me for about a week.  
---
I have always loved playing Destiny, but not for the same reason most people love it.  I love the PVP aspect.  Some, maybe most, hate it's PVP.  
---
I have a horrible KD (0.94), but still love to play it.
---
Dunno why.
---
A lfg for ingame would be cool but not matchmaking for a raid, a lot of people would get mad and quit if you don’t beat it the first time and there would be a lot of afker
---
OMG the timing
---
Imma level with you, you can’t complain when you aren’t even doing mountaintop effectively, and you cheesed your way into a stronger pinnacle weapon.
---
Because imagine matchmaking for a raid with a kid that doesn’t speak English and 3 others that don’t have mics.... do you really want that? Do you really want your raid experience to be like that? Just use LFG apps like every other person ever does
---
Even if his videos arent always that great, that phrase at the end is pretty catchy.  gotta admit that.  lol
---
Soaking wet!!!   lol
---
That’s more luck than I’ll probably ever be able to see lol
---
It’s not a 3rd party app if it is made by bungie.
---
LOL you haven't done one I take it.
---
Take it from someone who has 175+ raid clears on D2.
---
You don't want to join randoms on an activity like this. You would never get through one (or if you did, it would take 5x longer than with a good sherpa). Its just not a good experience because you don't have a leader to organize the team and everyone will be yelling at each other trying to run the raid. Anyone can matchmake so that means even if they gave their child the controller, they might matchmake into a raid. It simply won't work.
---
Now, what you CAN do is find better places to look. First, go over to /r/DestinySherpa. This sub is literally dedicated to people that want to take other people through the raid. Try your luck there as those people specifically want to teach new people how to raid.
---
Also, you can make your own post on LFG sites and say "I am learning and would like a teacher" and you may get some hits.
---
LFG is the worse place to find raids for new players.
---
People can be kinda cringe bro

---
*Me looking at my 1 core* Yeah I could use some...
---
There is a war going on?)
---
I imagine lord shax and zavala in a hot tub
---
yeah for certain guests and stuff you need to complete heroic event and on your own that can be very hard sometimes
---
I only recently got back into the game. I finished the last word last night but this one's been hard to get to drop for the last few days.
---
You find enough bad players on the lfg's let alone matchmaking, look at the menagerie, you get so many peeps with no clue how to do it.
---
I hate it so much, everytime my someone casts a super against it it becomes immune :(
---
Sick
---
Then delete this post. I don't know how it can be NOT political featuring The leader of a country with concentration camps and slave labour standing next to Kim Jong Un.
---
Now that’s a pro gamer set up, I’m impressed
---
Ah i didn't know that.
---
InStAgRaM!¡!¡!
---
But foresaken and the annual pass. On ps4 it’s a bundle with Osiris and warmind but don’t worry because foresaken is 40 usd and the bundle is 40 usd so it doesn’t matter m. Buy the bundle and you’ll be caught up
---
I like this. I'm time-poor for vidjamagames, so it's probably going to be a long time before I hit the content wall. If I hit it early, I'll upgrade. If I don't, steam could have a sale on Forsaken by the time I do, so may as well hold off. \^\_\^

&amp;#x200B;
---
I'll adopt that stance for now. Will wait and see on whether or not I get impatient enough for the other subclasses to break ranks on this decision before then. :P  
---
Thanks!
---
What recording program do you use by chance? I really should get one with the crazy shit that happens to me.
---
Ah is it, only started playing a week and a bit ago as I’ve not had my console with me, stopped just after expansion one so, apologies I was unaware
---
It's been there for as long as I can remember it's a moving against the enemy.
---
dOuBlE tAp!¡!¡!
---
Even Taniks has common sense, come on people
---
Also, anyone know if the missions towards the menagerie are independent to other characters? 
---
If I were to complete my first ever menagerie on 1 character, would I still have my first menagerie mission on my second character?
---
Q
---
Same thing happened to me rip
---
Goodbye
---
LMFAO taunting the vex is possibly the best moment in a destiny clip I’ve seen in a very long time !
---
Didn’t think it was cause there was no message in the chat bitty on updates in the area you know
---
Dudes just an asshat, don’t mind him
---
I trained her well lmao
---
Nor can I, thorn 3 taps. It does need a range buff for sure though.
---
PUNCH.
---
I hope soviet sees this.
---
IM ACTUALLY TIRED OF THIS THREAD YOU KEEP MENTIONING INABILITY TO USE A GRENADE LAUNCHER THATS WHAT IM COMPLAINING ABOUT IM COMPLAINING ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT USE THE THIS LOCKDOWN CHEEESE BECAUSE THEY CAN'T USE A GRENADE LAUNCHER. IM SHIT WITH GRENADE LAUNCHERS WHICH IS WHY IM DOING IT LEGIT TO TRY AND BTTER MYSELF NOT ONLY IN CRUCIBLE WHICH I;'LL ADMIT IM NOT THE BEST AT AND I CAN SAFELY SAY YOU PROBABLY ARENT THE BEST EITHER BUT IT ANGERS ME WHEN PEOPLE GO INTO THESE LOBBIES AND JUST SIT THERE GETTING EASY KILLS ON EACH OTHER. I DIDN'T START THE THREAD HOPING TO TALK ABOUT THE BEST LOUDOUT I STARTED IT IN HOPES TO HEAR EVERYONES OPINION ON PEOPLE DOING THIS CHEESE. ALSO MY PLAYSTYLE IS NOT BAD IT SIMPLY DOESN'T INVOLVE ANY WEAPONS YOU MIGHT USE, I DONT USE SHOTGUNS OR GL'S IN MY CASUAL LOADOUT MY CASUAL LOADOUT IS A SNIPER/RECLUSE AND A HANDCANNON AND A GOOD HEAVY WHICH I COULDN'T CARE ABOUT. AND IT WORKS AND THE PROOF OF THAT IS I RAISED MY KDA FROM 1.44 TO 1.51 IN THE LAST MONTH OR SO. AND NO RUNNNING 3 GL'S IS NOT THE ONLY WAY TO COMPLETE THE QUEST EVEN THOUGH YOU MAY SEE IT THAT WAY.
---
Good Job!
---
My thorn 8 taps, I was in iron banner the other week and it didn’t do any damage, it’s surprising how little bungie cares about the balancing of hand cannons
---
yeetus deletus.
---
How under light were you?
---
I love how the titans ult is just Captain America and nobody cares
---
I was 750
---
If you watch the bottom left of your screen near the end of the clip it says "The enemy weekens and retreats"  If it is not actually called an enemy moves against each other it is something very similar.
