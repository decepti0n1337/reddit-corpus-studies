Yeah, the gravity thing irks me as well. All the oxygen stuff I can ignore what with terraforming and other space magics. But the fact that I can jump just as high on the moon as on Earth gets to me.

You got all up in his personal space, &amp; he didn't like it

Don‚Äôt forget to equip a +10% xp ghost shell

He's wearing Skullfort, so probably top or middle tree.

MeinKampf
---
ok
---
Every team I play against apparently realizes this unfortunately.
---
Had this happen to me in a raid
---
Power ammo is the only time in competitive where I don't get OHKO after one kill, cause lol, thuderlord is a machine gun that's also a sniper, xd. That or huckleberry/ shotgun rush, which I don't do anymore, cause shotguns are too op and cheesy.
---
I'm at 40% scout kills and 42% medals with like 11 days left. I'm not sure I have it in me to grind as hard as I'm gonna need to.
---
The misfit is great in pve

Tickle fingers in D2 is the worst, most buggy and inconsistent thing I've used in the entire game, especially compared to D1's version .
---

---
1) activating it mid jump will stall your velocity, cause you to sink once the animation is done, and negate your ability to jump until you land.
---
2) you can't use it while in using glide - if you do, it either cancels glide causing you to sink, or does worknt at all, or makes half the animation, cancels and does no damage wasting a precious 3-5 seconds of the already limited super and probably getting you killed in PvP in the process.
---
3) you can't sprint. And the baseline running/floating around seems incredibly slow, atleast compared to D1.
---
4) from what Is a slow moving, mobility limited, close range only super, I can't see why it doesn't have damage resistance like the flying, rocket launching, sometimes homing sunbreakers and dawn blades.
---
5) the TTK with it is so inconsistent. Sometimes it does 2 ticks of damage in about. 5 seconds almost insta killing someone, and other times the animation is making a connection to the person but damage isn't being done to them as they fly over your head or around you barely on the edge of your range even though the animation and sound is being made.
---
6) the area of effect is definitely smaller than D1 in both radius range, angular degrees of effect in front of you, and in height above/over you.
---
I used to main storm caller in D1 and would typically do 5-6 flawless 9-0 trials runs per weekend. ( one on each character for myself then 3-4 extra on my warlock to carry people) and let me tell you storm caller FEELS terrible, buggy, inconsistent, buggy, and sometimes absolutely not worth using over say a shotgun: in the slow ass time for me to walk over to someone without my burst glide or sprint and hit someone with 2-4 ticks of SUPER damage mind you. I could sprint, slide burst glide and insta kill someone with a shorty and move on to the next target before the activation animation for storm caller is done. Even people like mtashed have said that storm caller feels horrible in D2, and I'm not saying this as if his opinion is law, but rather I mention this to demonstrate that I'm not alone in thinking this. I'm not saying the D1 storm caller was balanced or that D1 is better than D2, but the storm caller in D2 feels truly broken (as in unfunctional, not broken="overpowered").
---
But what if both the moon AND the sun are orbiting around the earth every 15 minutes? The results would look the same.
---
After I play cod for a while I try to tac sprint so much lol
---
That‚Äôs assuming that our ship stays in exactly the same spot.
---
thanksgiving was last month
---
After that title, I expected a flop.
---
I'm running snapshot with moving target and I love this thing.
---
You and me both! It's like I enjoy being punished.
---
I'm sure bungie has a reason but who knows. Even the forge polymer and the item for the pit can be used any time and will stay till you do said activity.
---
They're evolving
---
What platform are you on?
---
Xbox why
---
*Tries to withdrawal 1 Telesto*
---
‚ÄúYour account balance is: 1 Duke.44‚Äù
---
Yeah, I enjoy using it. But I was wondering about a Kinetic legendary auto rifle
---
I'd use the 100% more if I actually remembered. I like to use them in iron banner and wish more people would. Same for strikes always remember when the strike is over rip

---
My cousins were joining yesterday, one of them being 903 &amp; saying _"let's see how bad it is, I don't wanna keep playing if it sucks"_
---
he got a few 1.0+ka/ds &amp; I'm still unsure how, but he kept playing
---
What was the break nerf???
---
Meme Beam reigns supreme.
---
I spam E. Its just became a motor reflex now. I do it without knowing. It is sometimes can be considered as bad habit like in the last event where it sends you to the start if you respawn.
---
eh...
---
Yes man, if you are struggling with csgo on medium on that build, something might be wrong.
---
That's basically how I wound up with this, the Iron Banner symbol on the tailgate, the Hunter symbol I made my buddy..... I have a random thought and BOOM half hour later it's a sticker or a shirt.
---
My face when the format creator said the format was free to use and everyone starts throwing stones when people actually use it.
---
This has been over posted but I'll say this now. If bungie doesn't find a way to stop hackers on PC trials will be a joke. Maybe require the current season or something so f2p can't access it. But that's a risky option given the current standing of the game and community.
---
Your dad is incredible. Don't think I don't see that Pride emblem. &lt;3
---
It is said that in the end, when light and darkness have consumed everything and each other, 2 titans will remain, endlessly punching each other in pure bliss.
---
Apparently they did something to it so that the Onslaught perk that sped up the rate of fire the more you stacked Rampage makes it do less damage now.
---
Well, I‚Äôm just saying, get an OEM if you really want to piss the Jeep off
---
Welp. That's dumb as shit.
---
Is this Gambit?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Never done it, and was worried it was more PvP team vs team...but this looks like a blast!
---
Damn dude you totally made me remember I can make my own Hunter symbol. Thanks so much! Haven‚Äôt touched my cricket in years, haha.
---
Is there a gay cousin option üòÇ
---
I'm not your bro.
---
üòÇ
---
New Light? Thats my face and I'm a 5 year veteran
---
Try the Annex in the tower
---
Agreed. That was my favorite gun I used on my Titan.
---
It's David S. Pumpkins.. any questions? üòÅ
---
Happy Thanksgiving, Guardian! Have a great day playing Destiny :)
---
 What about the saladman
---
I was a pretty big fan of the ar, that does explain why I've felt less overall damage from it.
---
*switches to controversies hold voidwalker* ‚Äúwhy am I still doing so good?‚Äù
---
As an invader?
---
Happy thanksgiving! If I jump on later I‚Äôll hit you up!
---
Yeah my poor 970 has had some encounters with D2 aswell
---
Cool deal!
---
wdym?
---
Carry on Guardian.
---
The ollllll dick punch!
---
Sprinting? You're meant to fly. Also it blinks, I can consistantly kill entire teams with it. Mtashed said it feels bad and then uses it all the time because he knows he was wrong. It sometimes is a little funky to use but to say its garbage is just straight up wrong bruh. I think you might need to improve your play
---
Or r/fireteams
---
Yes, as I invade, they scatter like cockroaches lol
---
I think the only bounty that takes the longest is the Arsenal of Tricks one. It‚Äôs ridiculously slow
---
Yes that‚Äôs definitely what happened, I too have declined it. Didn‚Äôt know there was an accept option, darn! Thank you for the insight, if we ever step foot in comp again that is hahahaha.
---
Don‚Äôt forget Calus the one uncle that says ‚ÄúSo what are you gonna do with your life? Come work for me.‚Äù
---
Thank you, I reset my internet and it fixed the issue. I was worried I got banned
---
As a titan im glad to say that i used OEM once

My team did Raid flawless literally first week, it wasn‚Äôt really that hard. Solo the dungeon wasn‚Äôt bad either with the orb glitch. The only thing that‚Äôs even halfway difficult in pve is contest mode, and 980 material. Other than that it‚Äôs pretty much a joke.
---
No problem.
---
"They're always bagging me. What did I do?"
---
I got one with rangefinder, auto loading, and range masterwork...
---
Thank you!
---
What's your Gamertag? I'd really love to fact check the things you just said.
---
So basically, something happened.
---
I can‚Äôt wait for next season, hunters can‚Äôt complain that they don‚Äôt have a Ohk ability, and I won‚Äôt feel like a scum bag when using a OeM
---
Whelp sorry Rasputin, you've got to go i've found my new wallpaper.
---
sound like an ikelos smg, not sure why he was shooting it from there but hey
---
Everybody's forgotten about Trevor :(
---
Calus daddy....*burp* I didnt grow fat in strength through fighting....*burp*I got fat from all this food from this festival the tower had....eggghhhhuuuu.
---
You mean during the first phase, not allowing the boss to even go into the second phase?
---
Yeah same and if so know I feel badüòüüò≥
---
I know this feel. My gf hates me gaming.
---
Yeah sometimes I forget I‚Äôm on hunter and try to tbag.... during a Petra‚Äôs run (true story)
---
I LIKE EM BIG I LIKE EM PLUMPY I LIKE ERINTEL BROWN LIKE SOMETHING SOMETHING
---
The salty emote got me good NGL üòÇ perfection
---
Just needs Benny hill theme as soundtrack
---
Nothing gets me more rock hard than doming someone out of a super
---
Took me 3 months of doing almost every daily to get one...
---
Thanks for the info! I love this game and am always finding new things here and there
---
Also anyone who is against OEM re create this so it becomes the new OEM the harbinger of doom "Big Pumpkus"
---
Repost?
---
Sure, I'll add you sometime tomorrow afternoon
---
Oh my goodness....
---
Blast furnace, bygones, or redrixs broadsword.
---
Oh, okay. I was thinking it was Vex, but I wasn't sure of what type.
---
ngl, i kinda want that as a mode for like everyone game i have. and all npc's and players start dancing.
---
I've done it before with fusion rifles and ofc my own super. But damn, sniper shutdowns are just.... Orgasmic.
---
I was surprised as well, terraba also works really well with the perk active against enemies dealing damage to the primeval
---
Smells like turkey
---
Can‚Äôt really blame teammates when you know you are going in solo. Also you should have a mic to make call outs even if your teammates don‚Äôt have mics. If there‚Äôs a chat take advantage of it when you can. Otherwise just play don‚Äôt play solo at all go in with a friend/lfg/even invite the players that did well to the fireteam. If you are aware that you lose every time you go solo why ask for help? Ask for teammates in a lfg 4head
---
Imhotep's face went from Sean Connery to Nicolas Cage.
---
Can you be more verbose about how his life was sad?
---
This deserves more credit. Bitchin job
---
You said people could use the format dumb ass
---
Caydes the dead uncle too
---
You said new meme format happy for anyone to use
---
The only 3 charismatic characters in destiny
---
Taking credit for it is very different then using a format
---
[I beg your pardon, sir.](https://redd.it/beqaxb)
---
You had plenty of time to shoot him first, I say the gun is pretty balanced you just got out played :)
---
I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôve been playing for while regardless I don‚Äôt agree with this image with a text overlay
---
I used your format then posted a meme
---
I think this just effects new light players. Others I play with that had the game since launch have no issues with it dropping a lot sadly
---
Nut shots stagger. 
---
Good to know.
---
This is the way.
---
Nah it was faster than 17 seconds, you aren‚Äôt supposed to count loading screens in speed runs
---
You recreated it in crappy meme maker and hade a tile that‚Äôs says, making a new format
---
Pie-ron banner
---
Haha. More of a clan, then
---
Yeah he posted the meme with my username and is being a real jack ass
---
I heard all of these.
---
You know how Turkeys and Peacocks puff up to intimidate predators? 
---
Same thing here. It's a secret hunter strategy.
---
Do you even English?
---
I have around 40
---
I don‚Äôt know what any of those things even are so I would probably join just to piss them off.
---
Cool, I said that‚Äôs says, big deal.
---
It‚Äôs a fun game mode rn when you get players who aren‚Äôt douchebags but yea a lot of people do really play so bad to get their win
---
Ahh yes, I remember when my friend ran out of ammo... we all called him nuts, but he did manage to take a large amount of the bosses health before dying.
---
Yea same there was a time where I would get tons of smugglers words.
---
He‚Äôs speaking the language of the gods!
---
Shaxx already says CAPTURE AND DEFEND GUARDIANS
---
You‚Äôve become worse than the apes
---
Didn't he lose two, three fireteams of his? 
---
Didn't he become the head of the Hunters through the Dare, which activated through the death of one of his friends? 
---
He keeps track of his old life through his deck of cards, meaning he longs to remember, and simply can't. 
---
So... sad. 
---
There is certainly a fair bit more that I can't remember, but I think he deserves his sleep.
---
Follow up.  I had nearly 50, and 17 exotic weapons and the trophy randomly popped when I completed the mission ‚ÄúExodus Black.‚Äù
---
Hade a tile?
---
If you buff sidearm range then they'll encroach on handcannons. I think they just need quickdraw intrinsically to make them more viable as a shutdown weapon.
---
Nice man
---
Cant even remember what I have just havent really seen erentil a lot.
---
I‚Äôm sorry that your format did so well and 6.3k people liked it
---
Titans literally have 1 pve build so you can stop talking.
---
Your such a fckn clown
---
You should be happy that it did so well not angry just because making memes is hard and I didn‚Äôt give you credit
---
I miss the winter engrams that actually looked like this.
---
Titan is 956, hunter is 920. I understand the iron banner being one sided against me. But I also play gambit regular and prime, as well as momentum controll and normal controll in the crucible
---
Oh you‚Äôll see it
---
He means he misses having nova bomb, not he misses his shot.
---
Well the format that you made did good
---
Ah I didn‚Äôt know that.  Tbh there are better capes than the cayde one
---
I don‚Äôt lose every time. Lol. And most games are fine. The post is literally coming from frustration of watching team mates run right by objectives like they don‚Äôt need to be capped, 4head.
---
Not bad my hunter friend
---
Are they banana? Because I feel like that's a missed opportunity lol. Great job on the pies they look really amazing.
---
Missed the 2 exotics part...
---
Zavala: *seething with anger*
---
Ikora: "God damnit"
---
Cayde: *off somewhere looking for colonel*
---
Shaxx: *Rushing off to get a fire extinguisher*
---
Eris: *running into the fire*
---
Drifter: *laughing his head off*
---
Incredible
---
I constantly kill people in their supers with it. You can blink around them and tickle them to death. You might wanna try improving your play, as I said before. It's a high skill super, doesn't mean it's bad. Yea, it's not a shutdown super, does that make it unusable in pvp? Absolutely not. I have a feeling you're just trolling at this point. Have a happy Thanksgiving chief lol
---
No nova though. Titan and hunter are great but I end up missing my Nova Bomb.
---
All I want is Red Death... not that bastardization of red death called crimson
---
Resilience and strength are pretty useless. The other 4, especially recovery and intellect, are good.
---
Pre shadow keep there was only mobility, resilience and recovery. 
---
You could add mods to help with certain things like supers, but there was only the 3
---
Is this an alignment chart or a political compass?
---
I mainly worry about resilience and discaplin. I main Warlock and it helps having good bases for oppressive darkness. Solar for more healing nades. Pair it with exotic arms that consume gernade for arc soul too. I also just like not dying as fast. I never really notice super recharge rate honestly, I also hold my super for the right time.
---
Just luck. Rng gonna rng.
---
That hunter THICC
---
That's definitely true, but that's under the assumption that a typical Gambit invader won't take the path of least resistance by using the easy-aim weapons.
---
‚ÄúI remember changing your diapers! It was riveting‚Äù
---
Its free for a while now
---
That spawn kill was amazing lol.
---
Well that was an interesting read indeed.
---
Asher myr should go in the crazy/racist grampa slot.
---
I know but they still put the 40%off
---
Thanks a lot for your answer!
---
Fingers crossed on that "might". I was rather curious if Steam is the problem. As stated, I have never encountered any issues on the non steam version with pretty much every high end setting and I find it a bit odd to happen now
---
I see them split into two classifications. The first three are in the ‚Äúsurvivability‚Äù class, and the last three are in the ‚Äúlethality‚Äù class. The first three define how well you yourself can survive via mobility, resilience, and recovery. These will help you stay alive much longer in fights.
---
The other are just ability cool downs which, in my mind, give you added sense of lethality. If you can use two grenades in the time another guardian can only use one, you‚Äôre pretty deadly. These will help you not stay alive longer necessarily, but will help you end fights quicker with you leaving as victor.
---
There's another bounty that just says complete one ignition and it didn't pop either.
---
I wish I was in any way related to Cayde, but then again who doesn't, right?
---
Go to the collections tab and you‚Äôll see the ‚Äúexotic‚Äù slot.
---
Go to collections and then exotic tab, hover over the one you want and hit reaquire.
---
How does having 15 motes add any fun besides the potential of fucking over your team

Do you have a festival of the lost mask equipped?

I made some great memories in those 5 years

Oh yes , all my friends got their mythoclast like that .
---
Agreed. I managed to finish the scout kills last night, thankfully I was carrying on from 70%.
---
It's the medals that's going to take me a lifetime.
---
Or a shader. You can put those on exotic armor
---
Thanks I‚Äôll be sure to keep this in mind! I‚Äôm lowkey intimidated to begin because i feel like imma hate gambit prime and anything with PvP even more than I do now
---
Love and Death has an advantage over similar gernade launchers with spike nades (best perk, increase in damage on direct hit) in the perk full court which increases your damage the further you go. It‚Äôs archetype is the highest dps one.
---
No they don't? I don't know how else to respond to this email
---
If I'm completely sober and ready to play, Hunter all the way. But if I want to mess around and play with easier classes then I'll jump to another  class.
---
We wouldn't want to bother you while you're running away.
---
No I don‚Äôt think so. Do I need to?
---
That‚Äôs because it‚Äôs fun and rewarding. Don‚Äôt hate on it :(
---
Vex milk. Yummy
---
For calibrated frames I found out that you have to personally go to them in the quest menu to retrieve the reward now. What's the bounty you have been/are trying to complete called?
---
Probably just left over stock, they bought the game copies and now are just leaving them up for sale.
---
"Build a firewall and keep them out i say"
---
Let me guess, you also hate mainstream music, well I was like you once and I'll tell you something that hopefully sets you free. It's okay to like popular things and anyone who tells you otherwise is an asshole and you shouldn't listen to them.
---
What‚Äôs so bad about that?
---
Still scummy tho
---
I‚Äôm not really sure.  Wait for another answer before you do something that doesn‚Äôt need to be done.  I would bet that‚Äôs it tho ...
---
Nope it's formatting issue lol when I do it I gotta put two \\ cause it hides one
---
Just Knock-out the reaper set ‚Äúslowly‚Äù over the rest of the season, then once you‚Äôre done with it, you‚Äôll soon through the rest of it and have your well earned title.
---
Imagine if you were playing in VR and that happened lol
---
Just give me bite of the fox you salad bar
---
No you don't, I haven't started the campaign and I got TLW
---
Nah, a bad player will still do well, it's crucible on easy mode.  Now I'm talking about console where hunter is is top dog due to their evasiveness.
---
Any sniper rifles with hip fire grip are a good option to dismantle. 
---
Then look if weapons have perks that are contrary to each other, ex. Hip fire grip, range finder.
---
Supposedly they are "redoing" it and the new version will be out possibly June Next year, question is, will they make us pay for it
---
How does it show, do they have any levels of progress in the season? Gate lord‚Äôs eye, etc...
---
Well yes but actually no
---
Bruh I'm at 136 what are you doing
---
Why do people leave? Do losing teams get penalized? Or do they just not want to waste time?
---
Dismantle things you don‚Äôt use on a constant basis.
---
Wait, what's so special about it? I'm new light and have been using that thing for a few weeks now.
---
 Its definitely my favorite smg
---
I still use it, it's so fun with sentinel titan when you feeling fucking with strikers
---
You can try and max your strength stat
---
Did you get all the EP armor and Braytech weapons? That will be your biggest challenge by far.  May the RNG gods be with you...
---
This isn't an LFG sub.
---
/r/Fireteams
---
People leave because losing sucks man, nobody wants to get beat. But it's sad that I can't even finish a match with a complete team because people are constantly quitting
---
Sure it requires a kill, didn't you argue that hunters don't have health regen where other classes do? I rebutted that argument. I also added that hunters can health regen at the push of a button.
---
Omg the chippy laggy gameplay even in PVE is driving my friends and me insane at times. Enemies teleporting everywhere etc, im not sure how their pve backend functions but its shit now and never used to be this bad.
---
Sure they can, that's how a scrub like me still does well in PvP, with easy mode hunter.
---
That‚Äôs the dlc, you absolute toblerone
---
Still dumb lmao. They tryna bait people
---
YOU
---
SHALL
---
DRIFT
---
sorry, it took a while to reply but there was no silver added to the account, it just shows the option to buy the season pass.
---
I respect the first person who ate a mushroom
---
SCEXY
---
Not at all, people know it‚Äôs ftp. People who just joined might also want to buy the dlc at a discounted price. That‚Äôs literally the point of advertising prices like this. They‚Äôre not trying to ‚Äòbait‚Äô anyone.
---
Twas a joke. I'm just saying, if you are on the moon and both the moon and sun orbit earth in 15 minutes, it would look like the earth is rotating in 15 minutes.
---
Sexy Aunt, Mara?
---
This is the Way.
---
Hunters have health regeneration at the same rate as other classes? Titan and Warlock both have regeneration with a melee kill.
---
Hunters don't have health regeneration at the press of a button? That's the old Wormhusk, which I already said was broken. They balanced it only a month or two after release. Nothing like the OEM that has been plaguing PvP for many months.
---
Contact bungie directly, something well messed up, hope you get it all back quick
---
Nope I quit because of gambler‚Äôs ruin.
---
Nah. U list the dlc, not the game. And no. New players that never heard of the game wont know
---
Im sure the hard core crucible players have.
---
LOLLL its called voicing my opinion and it was initially meant to be a meme joking about it but yall niggas decided yall wanted to start shit for no reason. You could have also kept your mouth shut as well and scrolled over my post, but it seems youre the kid that wants to start shit so its to be expected. In all honesty i welcome all angry people anytime. Its also funny how youre being irrelevant by mentioning my excessive use of "bro" which says you have nothing better to do than talk about any flaw of mine that makes you feel superior to me but if thats what youre into knock yourself out. Anyway just think about how youre telling me, that I could have "kept my mouth shut" and never made this post "trying to start shit" when you went out of your way just to stumble upon my post and just have to say something.
---
I thought maybe the ones he had were slightly larger than what‚Äôs in the pic on the bungiestore.
---
Nah, you've already said you don't play all the classes.
---
If you did you'd know what you're saying is factually, 100% wrong.
---
Titans plz stop sniffing crayons for the love of sweet baby jesus
---
Those are the only ones that have been officially sold by bungie
---
Rest in pieces
---
When I received the email about the restock I got my order in, I thought the the only chance I would have for buying these would have been through scalpers trying to sell it for 5 times the upcharge for my size. I hope fans who actually want these to actually wear would get these before they sell out again.
---
Now lets go to prison whoooooooo got you got you GOT YOU
---
Well like what do you mean. Like did you have some godrolls in there you wanted to keep or? Because all progress is realistically saved in collections and whatnot.
---
Really? The Tangled Shore map?? I love that one tbh, I can't stand Vostok
---
 Imma air drop this
---
That about sums it up for me.
---
The terrain is absolutely a nightmare for a warlock main like me, Vostok is just lane camping simulator which isn‚Äôt fun, but still playable.
---
Some guns I 100% had are totally missing from collections I have the completed quests and everything.
---
They are Intrinsic perks, and they simply decide the archetype of the weapon: lightweight frame means the weapon handles better and you move faster with it, aggressive frame has worse handling but a lot of damage, rapid-fire frame has high rate of fire, precision frame has high accuracy, balanced frame is a jack-of-all-master-of-none.
---
Dont forget about the gambit ritual weapon lol. Once I got ranndy's I thought the bulk of annoyance was over but think again.
---
Gibraltar
---
Check out iFrostbolt on yt. He has done it with all characters
---
Non-Titan main here: How come his sprint-lines/ability to shoulder charge triggered almost immediately after starting sprinting? From my very limited time with Titans it seemed to take a second or two of running before it would enable the shoulder charge.
---
I know IT still makes me sad (for me it was 2 days ago
---
I feel like Eris is the one cousin you go on a walk with, and cayde and the drifter both know. Shaxx is the drunk boisterous uncle.
---
That was excellent
---
no one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip.
---
What's the % increase from box breathing on it, is the Whisper's catalyst's precision dmg upgrade good enough to 3-shot knights on last boss in shattered throne?
---
Leviathans breath 2: The prequel

Shoulder charge isn't the only way, try bottom tree sunbreaker melee.

New laptop?? Go and download the latest drivers for your Windows version from nvidia and remove all existing nvidia software from your machine and install the new drivers
---
Happy cake day
---
unlimited power
---
So lemme tell you whats finna happen, you wrote me a whole letter, thats cute but not gonna read it bc like you said "its a waste of time" so imma rest my case here since ive "wasted my time" with you plus youre never going to shut up so Imma head out have fun tho
---
It does drop with randomly rolled barrel and mag perks - only the Outlaw - Desperado perks are locked on the ones you get from Shaxx.
---
Oh wow, I wasn‚Äôt aware. Thank you Guardian!
---
I got a fresh titan from 750 to 940 in 2 days.
---
Ok, have fun then!
---
One day HE WILL eat an ENTIRE SCORN.
---
I might like this pie more than the actual iron banner .
---
Let me get Back Home First. Then imma search you some Fostbolt / Heathead vids
---
Yea that‚Äôs what I heard. But I‚Äôm getting 2 kill streaks in multiple lives but no increase in percentage. I‚Äôve been stuck at 40% for an hour. Did it do that to you?
---
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve used whisper again them tbh, I know it‚Äôs still a very good weapon for the dungeon. I‚Äôm sure someone else can give you a better answer though lol.
---
Misfit maybe?
---
Half Life 1.5 confirmed
---
Too bad we don‚Äôt have a character to represent the annoying children that won‚Äôt shut up.
---
Shaxx, Sounds like me.
---
PASS ME THE GRAVY HUNTER, NO TITAN EVER WON BY UNDERFEEDING HIMSELF.
---
"Im selling my vex bathwater for you thirsty guardians"
---
You won't receive a pinnacle drop the same level as a powerful drop unless you are 960 gear. Because pinnacle drops 2 light above max equipable light. Powerful drops at max equipable.
---
There's no special slot in the game mate, you're thinking of energy
---
What a Chad he was, favorite character by far. I don't know why that line had such an impact, but the way the mc talked afterwards kinda felt out of place seeings as how talking during his send off would have made it more wholesome
---
Low sens
---
Ummm, they used up all their design originality in Destiny 1.
---
It's pronounced "gif"
---
Imagine Saladin preparing this for Shaxx
---
All I need is somemore bow and fusion riffle kills, then this repetitive fever dream will finally be over.
---
Your a pie lord now
---
There was one like that in D1
---
 [https://www.bungie.net/en/ClanV2/MyClans](https://www.bungie.net/en/ClanV2/MyClans)
---
Warlocks have useless aeon exotics that look dope also when equipped lol
---
But she always brings her brother with her and that's a mod killer.
---
Now we can beat him [like this.](https://youtu.be/yjhb65VLKdM?t=86)
---
^((not 100% sure, but it should work on phogath the same))
---
*laughs in moira main*
---
Well OP actually had a 2.88 with 20+ kills soo..
---
I wish I could see life as bleak and joyless as you do, but I prefer to not live with my head up my own asshole.
---
Just playing for a week for so, (already love it enough to spend $ for DLCs), however the "No space" (63 limit to quests) if pure bullcrap. Why is that there?! 
---
Can't imagine what it's like to people playing this for years.
---
So I basically have to choose between missions and bounties?
---
Randy's, Recluse, Truth
---
As a former titan main all I say is no
---
you talk to ada and finish the frame she gives you, which will reward you with the hammerhead
---
It‚Äôs just like Bungie to add a gun that can heal people. But hey, I‚Äôm not complaining
---
Good counter now eat them again
---
Personally I don't leave even if I'm losing when the match is fair. But, I do leave sometimes when I'm being matched against stacked teams. I don't want to waste my time being a punching bag for a bunch of stacked sweaties running around with recluse, oem, tlw, mountaintop and all other unbalanced crap.
---
Don't be silly! 
---
Encouraging a player to spare their daylight for 3 months and gift something to reach level 400etc is very dangerous and would be highly irresponsible. Because ppl will do it! 
---
There is enough grinding in D2.
---
Also, it's not that hard, I work full time, I played D2 just when I got back home for a month from 0 to 100 but pretty much every evening sans the evening when servers whacked. It was easy to do without Season Pass XP bonuses!
---
Nice to know, even tho I'm not new light player.
---
I was on my way to insert the last orb yesterday and then 3 of these guys show up...
---
I‚Äôm totally not pressing 1 button, right?
---
Any info on what exactly they wanna have in the revamped version? Like what would be different?
---
It was worse back then.
---
only on precision hits tho
---
The question is when you're in a strike.
---
Have you considered not everyone can afford top of the line gpus? And picking one up with headroom can improve your fps/$ significantly.
---
Yup, the bottom tree gunslinger will have a new knife that has a longer windup, bounces of a wall once and one hit to the head in pvp
---
What drugs have you been using to stay alive after all that grind? Lmao 
---
Btw congratulations on that SP lvl. This is amazing!
---
RNG
---
*hot aunt
---
It could still be faster
---
I thought this was for DND, still not too far off.
---
It‚Äôs been 13 hours OP how burned is the pie?
---
 
---
&gt;He was using last word-beloved
---
I just threw in my mouth a little
---
I mean, it's clearly working so I am not that mad..but again I wasn't going against him.. so
---
Its cool the first few times, but annoying after the 59th one. Would be great if I could get other rolls of other pinnacle weapons.
---
Goodness gracious great bommmmmmbbbbbbbsssssss of nova.
---
It was leviathan raid.
---
smh my head
---
Devrim, your uncle who works for the military, Sloane, your grandma that you never really liked, Brother Vance, your older brother who has schizophrenia because he‚Äôs always talking about ‚ÄúOsiris‚Äù but you never actually see Osiris
---
Oof that was clean, golden gun invasions are the one thing I can never get mad at when I die
---
Interesting, in game store just led to download destiny 2. Already says it's installed =/
---
*Holds up hand* here!
---
100 silver per level. lol
---
I wish I had a grandma
---
Inb4 it gets nerfed by salty OEM titans (HIGH sarcasm) 
---
The one-shot knives seem like they'll be far more rewarding for people who are skilled enough to hit them, without making people tilt too hard.
---
Yes because of vex offensive. It is leaving after this season ends.
---
***WARFRAME FLASHBACKS***
---
Clarifying: in this case he means class. If you have two hunters only the first one that ran the raid will get anything. If you run it on a hunter, then a warlock, then a titan all three would get drops. But again, if you had two warlocks, only the first one would get drops. 
---
It hardly seems to slow down the major players, but it stops people from running three of the same class through powerful / pinnacles to level to max in a week.
---
Man, my mum didn't grasp the concept of Gambit.
---
Ps, I won't be getting it. Too much vex offensive for me,  it was cool for awhile but damn.
---
The helmet stayed on.
---
Even on pc tho.  Every weapon has a hidden aim assist stat
---
If you have a Smugglers Word with Kill Clip, you can 2-Burst people, even if they have 8 Resilience. Smugglers Word is OP in that aspect.
---
Did you play thru where Cayde dies?
---
bad titan! using oem! bad bad titan
---
I really like the hunter armor ornaments from the  season pass, it looks like actual armor instead of the normal hunter tights and goes really well with the celestial nighthawk helmet
---
If you can‚Äôt beat them, join them. 
---
Btw I made this titan *three days ago*
---
Because of the bullshit strat that abuses the terrible catch up mechanics inside gambit.
---
The mode is pretty much universally despised for a reason
---
God damn. That was beautiful.
---
Is there any point in doing IB at 920 gear lvl? I heard I'd get stomped by lvl advantage
---
Pretty sure you can turn it off in the settings.
---
Idk man, I really enjoy gambit tbh, yeah I'll agree catch up mechanics arent great but as long as there's at least one person who can deal with invaders then it's not really that bad
---
Packed together like that they're just waiting for a bloom warlock to really hurt the frame rate.
---
Idk but generally it happens at the boss i think they just joined for the check point
---
Does he sell the jade rabbit? I want that gun too
---
Oh wow the couple drawing sounds like something he would lose his mind over! Thank you so much for your help!
---
iirc there is a way to disable the HUD through in-game settings, but there is no free roam camera for screenshots (even though there really ought to be)
---
Most people really like Shaxx and Cayde :)
---
Alright my GT is JofinnSenpai I‚Äôll send a message and message when you free to do your quest
---
How do you know what he got tho
---
You've clearly never used handheld lol. I stopped using it because it seems like as soon as you turn too quick or get shot, or someone glances in your general direction, you stop charging it for some unknown reason. Also with assassins cowl there will be no "skill" involved. Stand there while invisible
---
yeah I love playing healer every now and then. I got to 100 discipline on my warlock and put on starfire protocol with double breach refractor, lumina, bug out bag (with demolitionist and anti barrier rounds), and edgewise with demolitionist. I literally never run out of healing grenades, and if I do somehow, I have lumina, healing rift, and well. I highly suggest trying this build :)
---
He isn't there yet wait 45 min
---
I usually do this..
---
Spider --&gt; Tribute hall --&gt; Spider--&gt; Tribute hall--&gt;Spider --&gt; Tribute hall --&gt; Spider--&gt; Tribute hall--&gt;Spider --&gt; Tribute hall --&gt; Spider--&gt; Tribute hall--&gt;Spider --&gt; Tribute hall --&gt; Spider--&gt; Tribute hall--&gt;...
---
Till the end of f*cking time..
---
Yes I have played the game. Meaning I know a bunch of triangles does not mean the same as the ships you see at the end of the cinematic.
---
A fair argument
---
I have that actually.never really used it !
---
Get him OEM
---
&gt; Shaxx just creamed Saladin
---
FTFY
---
You need forsaken if I recall. The lumina chest is in the same area and at the same camp as the thorn in the campfire. The lumina quest is called "a weapon of hope".
---
No
---
No i mean I didn‚Äôt even think it was in his entire potential inventory. Like I know you can‚Äôt get bad juju from xur. I thought that‚Äôs what it was like for jade rabbit.
---
It's the fact you spammed 5 posts in 7 minutes which got them removed for spam. If you sprinkled them across a couple hours, there wouldn't be a problem. But having so many posts come through from one person is WAY too much.
---
you'll get there eventually i promise
---
gun is incredibly worth it at least
---
I know.. otherwise wouldn't have bothered :)
---
Its DesDestiny
---
No bother, also if I've done this right...[here's the link to the poster that datto got hopefully.](https://twitter.com/DattosDestiny/status/1149407927167438848?s=19)
---
The knife can hit them before they are close enough to use their OHKO how that is so hard for you to realize idk üòÖ also you can finish someone off around a corner if you bounce it right when they try to hide out of your guns LoS, like ricochet rounds can. I imagine it can also be thrown from mid air so you can double jump over someone and throw it down (easier to hit the head from above) and because the jump can cover way more vertical space real quick than lift/glide can theirs loads of opportunity to outplay someone going for a shoulder charge/HHSN.
---
Or, y'know, be a dick like me and rock Crimson.  32x3 per head is BUSTED.
---
Yes sir, and this information has greatly spead up my lightlevel climb:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/raidsecrets/comments/dh4chi/gos_encounter_specific_loottable/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Thanks a million. I've been stuck on this part forever. I'm a sucker for hand cannons, lol. Trying to get all the cool ones. I've got Ace of spades, Thorn, and The Last Word. I need Malfeasance, Lumina, Luna's Howl (doubt I'll ever get that one) The Not Forgotten, and which ever ones I'm forgetting
---
Hey man, Crimson is also a good choice! Just TLW and Ace have a quest, Crimson is a random drop!
---
&gt; **When a blueberry keeps invading without any invader armor while your cheeked up and ready** 
---
invader armor doesn't mean you don't suck as an invader. You're getting it from gambit's version of strike, not from gambit matches
---
No every random exo drop can be selled by him
---
I don‚Äôt get it.
---
Most impressive
---
The blueberries in your squad must worship the effing earth you walk on :P
---
Thank you for this the main thing i took were crimson and it helped so much. I havent done flawless yet but im tryna learn it all first
---
Yes 911.... I would like to report a crime.
---
What was the comment ?
---
We are screwed
---
Get good
---
lmao nope they run away from my healing grenades most of the time because not enough people play that subclass outside of dropping well
---
I‚Äôve seen plenty of blueberries invade with no gambit armour and do far better than so called dedicated invaders. Let‚Äôs by honest, anyone with truth is going do the job.
---
I can't use Ace for shit and TLW is not my style (tho hot DAMN do you feel like a cowboy). Still, great guns. Also, shoutout to Thorn &amp; Sun Shot for being fun too.
---
Undying, the wayfarer of year 3
---
MMMMMMM üòã
---
I actually main voidlock, mostly for blink. But I do play hunter too, so I‚Äôm pretty familiar with these abilities. Which is how I know that there is no invisibility in the gunslinger subclass... lol
---
Probably better than most players but ok
---
Yes! Now I can kill whoever killed the boss without making it heroic.
---
First comment is hilarious.
---
Assassins cowl. Look it up
---
I just started playing last night because I LOVED Destiny 1 and always maxed out but just got into Destiny 2. What expansions/DLC should I get if I‚Äôm loving the game?
---
It‚Äôs a pretty damn good rocket launcher, I use mine all the time.
---
Them be like :- " oooh a grenade, RUN, holdup, it's my teammate, but it's chasing me, RUN, holdup it's white though" üòÇ
---
\*QUADRUPLE KILL\*
---
\*internally rages\*
---
Nah, chaperone, misfit, night terror, with full armor from brother Vance. Guaranteed one man.
---
Moira in overwatch is a healer but she has a pretty high dps and she usually get most damage
---
Lol, I didn't realize it! Pretty funny
---
Correct, but other locations don't feature the repeatable quests and such.
---
It's pretty nice to just grab tons of strike bounties, all the moon stuff and then just complete those in one go. Only issue is running into too many weapon specific ones. :/
---
Makes me wish the other planetary vendors had more than a weak 3 available daily bounties lol
---
Well thats why he called a support character he support you in killing you enemies faster
---
Legends says that his medals is still counting...
---
How much silver did she coin out for this one
---
You‚Äôre right. I bet he talks in his sleep about how broken it is
---
Not sure I agree that resilience is useless, I‚Äôm able to survive a lot more in pvp with a 70 than a 35
---
Yea.. i would love to farm on titan for example.
---
Tbh i just do those while finding out-of-bound spots when i'm bored and scarlet keep provided a pretty obvious one. I still don't get why devs put in a barrier at the top that limits how high you can jump and then let the actual wall end below that..
---
She was as a fan made frame put into the game which is cool
---
Lol yeah I'm constantly asking myself questions about why the devs constrict our exploration in the ways that they do. Invisible walls can be heartbreaking haha
---
I‚Äôm glad I got a chance to use it before they nerfed it. But people don‚Äôt seem to like OEM / mountaintop / recluse Titans.
---
Just playing playlist won‚Äôt boost your level anymore. You have get powerful engram rewards to boost to 950 and then farm pinnacle rewards. Playlist will only drop stuff near your power level never higher.
---
Nothing like a toxic free raid !
---
No.
---
Is it actually Riskrunner? I haven‚Äôt checked yet.  Gooood I hope not
---
Just got it finally a few days ago. Trust me it's well worth all the effort, and even after nerds will remain OP on PC
---
You aren't siding with the Vanguard bro. You're siding with a crazy religious faction within the Vanguard. If Shaxx is cool with the Drifter I'm cool with the Drifter.
---
I'm pretty sure the Titan that cast the Ward of Dawn missed his shotgun blast as I was floating over.
---
Seriously? I dont think so... Besides, titans doesnt even need those builds to work as op as a handheld discipline could be, now imagine a titan with a build as good as a discipline handheld warlock... And being able to use any class they want instead of being locked into a single tree... Yeah... With OEM no less
---
Im currently going for that discipline warlock build, but only got back to destiny 3 days ago, havent played since forsaken, a lot changed, the stats on equips is nice and the discipline warlock is great, but it only came 2 years after launch, while titans still have the most exotic stuff since launch
---
Rift was never a thing in D2, sadly.
---
Would be good if it came back though.
---
I‚Äôm sorry, I did try google but it wasn‚Äôt clear what content I was gonna get, plus I saw content I can play with new light too.
---
I know the feeling. Didnt know it was possible before your post and then used all my tokens amd got 2.
---
I have build on 539 sooooo...
---
Oh trust me, this is the one good Nova I've had in a long time. The blast radius is so low on bottom tree, I expected to only get a kill or two.
---
Mtn top, recluse, whisper is what I run. Unless someone complains about using izzy, recluse, wendigo specifically.
---
I didn't mean to ask only me, but ok let's see if i can answer...haha
---
1: It's free to play now. It's called now Destiny: New Light. In includes: Base game, Curse of Osiris and Warmind + some of Year 2 activities are free and it has 2 DLCs. Forsaken (2018) and shadowkeep which is now 2 months old.
---
2 and 3: Well, you learn swiss german by talking. That's it. No school for it. There is no real grammar.  But german in general is the language i grew up with as that's how we learn to write in school. It's kind of crazy when you think about it. I play raids with german strangers. And most of them are really funny guys or gals.
---
Albanian is my actual mother language. It's from Albania, a very unknown little country in south east europe. An earthquake shook up the country this week. Just 2 days before the independence day (28th November) and it killed and injured quite a few cilivilans in case you heard any news about it.
---
English is self explanatory. It's burned in my mind because everyone speaks it and i also learned it from cartoons and games. And i also watch some movies in english, even tho german voice actors are quite good. 
---
Other than that i can speak a few sentences in french and italian.
---
Dunno where you're from, but in switzerland it is normal to learn at least one more language as this country has 4 official languages. And the one i *had* to learn was french. I don't like it. I really don't.
---
4: PS4 only. Didn't bother much with gaming lately. Lots of work to do.
---
How‚Äôd you do this? I have no gear below 750
---
All the moon weapons do the exact same thing
---
That triumph score thoughüëÄ
---
Wow I need to pay more attention!
---
Did you watermark your own photo?
---
With no Rally they lost all purpose and fade into the background like all non-vendor NPC's.
---
Aww man. I must be getting confused with D1. Yeah that was my favorite mode. So exhilarating
---
I got that from the random drop last week. Hope you get it brother
---
It was in the ViDoC you probably just didnt see that. Im sure most people wouldnt notice
---
It gets easier in the next step. SMG kills takes maybe one or two matches.
---
this is in Grove of Ulan-Tan lost sector and disappears when u enter combat with vex in main chamber \[hes in the cache and boss room\]
---
Happens to the best of us. I can't even begin to count how many times I've whiffed a nova in trials or comp.
---
I don‚Äôt really use OEM often, I prefer Skullfort. Recluse though I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôll replace it with if anything
---
Any weapons that have random roles cannot be required through the collection
---
That happened the next match.
---
I thought it was more about using the darkness or something. Didn‚Äôt really care since it was just fluff anyway.
---
Vouch for this I love it. It's actually quite high skill to get the most out of it, lot of tactical shooting and throwing instead of just shooty-shooty the face the whole activity. Throw a blessing on a downed teammate to revive them mid-combat easier, and you can be very liberal with your grenades, both healing and damage. Plus I love the look of it, I seen people saying they hate it though so it's a personal thing I guess. I think aztecross made a cool video on it, Noble Protocol if you wanna look it up. Try it out!
---
Hey guys watch my choccy milk I gotta use the restroom
---
So what you want for doss damage is Izanagi with catalyst, and a love and death with spike grenades and full court. Never ever use wendigo, wendigo is hot garbage. You can pretty much use whatever you want for first two encounters because it‚Äôs mostly just killing ads.
---
Could you circle it all I see is 
---
#C O N D U C T O R    A R O    A L E X
---
Nope.
---
Or is it that guy?
---
ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è so this is the reason my team got stomped 80-1 in a matter of a minute lol
---
I saw 2 a the lost specter in the EDZ I thought they where only on the moon
---
I've done it twice on Strange Terrain with randoms who knew what they were doing.
---
What?
---
K
---
Why don‚Äôt you just grind out some singles and get it?
---
Gimmie my trespasser back
---
Unknown. That might happen, or it might require next season's season pass to get.
---
No everybody knew its just that it happened so fast
---
Sometimes I really just don‚Äôt feel like finishing a gambit match tho
---
Yeah ive been thinkin about that too. Considering we cant get another Master of Arms perk, next best thing would be Heros Burden with High Impact Reserves and Rampage. Exit strategy is nice too, but of course swashbuckler and surrounded take longer to activate than rampage or even kill clip.
---
Well i blame my brother he got me addicted to destiny 1 then i was around since release of destiny 2 been through the bad times and the good and alsways stayed playing destiny 2 even when I'm all upto date I devote my spare time to help randoms in the community
---
I guess everything gets downloaded with new light and then  eventually unlocked if bought, not 100% sure tho
---
It's *extra* good in gambit, it's still a perfectly fine HC for PvP especially if you like the feel.
---
No worries.
---
preety sure its pvp but if u put ur mouse over where the catalyst will be i think it tells you
---
Now that HC's got range nerfed, Malfe is one of the best Hand Cannons out there since it can 5 tap from any distance *ANY*
---
Absolutely brutal, id expect half of them to rage quit if the game wasn't over anyway
---
My favorite hand cannon. I play on xbox and find myself struggling with 140s and 150s. Except for ACE and Lunas Howl.
---
Only one shot warlock ability is Handheld Supernova which is a grenade, melees don‚Äôt one shot
---
Look up bungie pc move on google
---
I just got one of the best hunter exotics of a drop yesterday, but I hadn‚Äôt had a single one drop in months of almost exclude PvE. They are just extremely rare or streaky.
---
Nice. So it has no damage falloff.
---
I‚Äôve had some strikes like that. Forge runs are bad with some randoms especially when I max temper them and we lose because someone quits or is over licking windows instead of trying to damage the main boss
---
Or if you go console&gt;pc
---
Look up bungie cross save
---
And another
---
Bruh I literally use warlock for the ophidian aspects
---
I dont need any more warlock exotics
---
one of the nerfs-
---
‚ÄúAs such, we reduced the speed at which Burst Glide accelerates players in Daybreak‚Äù-twab
---
the new icarus dash rework and celestial fire seems okay but for the most part pretty useless. seems like it‚Äôs just a cooler melee ability and a faster icarus dash.
---
the consume grenade ability, ‚ÄúHeat Rises‚Äù, allows you to consume your grenade ability for increased glide time and in air accuracy.
---
winged sun makes it so you can shoot weapons, throw grenades and use the celestial fire melee ability in air and it also relies on airborne final blows to recharge mele ability.
---
if you don‚Äôt see what i‚Äôm getting at here, it‚Äôs that everything in the new top tree dawnblade ‚Äúbuff‚Äù is so reliant on you being in air. in pvp (competitive and even quickplay) there is no place for this considering if you try to play this subclass tree to be somewhat useful, meaning utilizing the airborne play style that this new ‚Äúbuff‚Äù ensues, you‚Äôll immediately be sniped out of the air or make yourself a huge target making it a much worse subclass to use than bottom tree.
---
in pve i don‚Äôt understand any use for this besides ad clearing which bottom tree could do much better. if you want to have a good ad clearing super, then using tickle fingers would be a much better option.dps wise, if you intend to use any solar tree  for dps besides middle tree, then i hope you‚Äôre joking. for speed running the increased glide time from a consumed grenade would be nice but i‚Äôm sure speed runners  will still use the middle tree grenade hold rather than that.
---
His shield bash didn‚Äôt register, but the other players regular melee did which let him get the kill on the follow up melee. Lmao
---
A whole lotta gambit but it's worth it. Solid hand cannon to go for. Although with the change to the drop rates of the ghost, sparrow and ship; I'm not sure if it's easier now or was easier a year ago.
---
Xurs selling graviton Lance, stompers, transversive steps and Ursa furiosa.
---
wasn‚Äôt that the uplink like game mode? if so that was my favorite in d1 and i don‚Äôt know why they didn‚Äôt bring it back in d2.
---
next season they are getting big buff
---
You're main goal is to just play whatever and get to 900 power level
---
yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa that happen
---
Well, then. That would certainly explain my problems with the gun. Maybe I'ts a graphical glitch, but I haven't actually seen any of those orbs drop. What do they look like?
---
How do I get a sparrow?
---
You can you just need to find this image screenshot or download it, and send it to someone through your phone on the ps app, then screen shot the image on ps4 then boom. 
---
You should know the rest
---
you can where or i should say which encounter
---
I think Shaxx's ejaculate broke into orbit
---
if what i explained above is a buff to warlocks then idk what bungies idea of a buff to warlocks is
---
Hahahaha
---
I see people having names after their nick, how does that work?
---
Go into your collections tab, into vehicles, and tab through each season until you see the one you want. Hover over it with your cursor.
---
Green bois, orbs. They float into you
---
Momentum is coming back next week. Rest your scout rifle til then brother. Ive grinded my scout kills before momentum came or we knew what scouts would do in there. Including iron banner weeks. Its not worth your soul, guardian.
---
It be like that.
---
As the city burns
---
What about weapons? How do I get those?
---
Just after the cannon shot, where you can get the secret chest, to one side you can see the boss arena, to the other, nessus itself

Yes only top tree nova can be destroyed, but teammates or enemy players can also destroy it. It's actually better than running of you a high fire rate weapon to destroy the large nova and the resulting mini novas
---
Top tree void with contraverse hold and ashes to asset
---
i mean if you pick up orbs then wendigo is pretty good so if you use recluse or something to generate them off of double kills, then you could get six easily
---
That was always the best in D1, watching a team pop a bubble in a good spot and i suicide nova bomb the titan from inside his own bubble. 
---
I wonder if they start to panic when they see me just sprinting straight at them?
---
Even with the buff wendigo can‚Äôt compare to god roll love and death or spike swarm
---
Which raid is this?
---
Gonna have to hard disagree with you.
---
Sunshot used to be an option doing the Red War, but those rewards were removed. Sunshot is now random drop only.
---
Flip second and fourth panel and it‚Äôs perfect
---
Is Graviton Lance good? I tried it and thought it was ass but my friends are telling me I'm wrong
---
This gun is awesome, but its not possible ti change color//skins on it?..
---
Very fitting considering how munch my back hurts due to carrying apes on a daily basis.
---
I‚Äôve been trying it in pvp and I‚Äôm not a fan as well. Maybe if I get the catalyst then it will change but I‚Äôd rather use other pulse rifles that don‚Äôt take up an exotic slot
---
Nezarecs sin helmet + any void class/weapons = power
---
That‚Äôs cool, I honestly wanted to like Randy but I just didn‚Äôt vibe with it after using it for a while.

Lol we dont live together anymore, im 26, but we do raid together frequently and he just helped me get through the new dungeon for the first time haha
---
I've tried it in both PvP and PvE, and I don't see why someone would use GL over something like the Iron Banner pulse (forgot the name)
---
Hey Xur why do you always sell riskrunners?
---
Everything is installed with the base game, the dlc downloads are just a licenses that take up maybe 10MB of space.
---
He used the bubble to destroy the bubble
---
Looks super sick, I like the vibe on it.  Kinda feels like the traveler has fallen along with the vanguard and it‚Äôs kind of a take on how our guardian was the travelers chosen but he couldn‚Äôt stop the fall of everything.
---
I just saw in the in-game notifications that Momentum Control is coming back and I'm stoked. If I don't clear it during banner this weekend, the kills/medals part is going to fly by in there for Randy's...
---
Then I can comp it up and see which others I can clear.  I also just got Anarchy to drop on Thursday, so...
---
I would raid with you but, I'm on a different platform. People on Reddit are mean this may have been a bad decision asking on here. My advice would be to go follow a raid lfg ps4 community and people on there are always trying to raid.
---
sure! if you also on PS4 my user name is Snake-Eater2007 and i want to do a raid
---
Did any Guardian other than our player ever swapped subclass ? Never played Destiny 1 so as I never saw any npc guardian swapping subclass, I assumed lore-wise they aren't swappable thing and it's just a gameplay commodity.
---
I was reading that the newest PS4 update is going to help HDR that‚Äôs too dark if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre playing on
---
It's always this same exact screenshot that's reposted here..
---
if you want to
---
On Xbox one X, but hey that's still good news, hopefully it's coming my way too!
---
Do you know if you can get a full auto role for that iron banner pulse? Where you can just hold down the trigger and it keeps shooting?
---
But that costs glimmer and time, two things I‚Äôm running out of faster than expected
---
Sure...when my internet stops bugging out I‚Äôll add ya, also my PSN is Sp00dermainYT
---
Jesus
---
Thanks a lot for that!
---
I've never gotten a ghost, and I'm really scared that I will die and lose my character because I need a ghost to rez. How do I get one?
---
You get 1 from lost sectors and 2 from public events. I just ran them.
---
NyQuilx420 if you're on PS4. We raid frequently!
---
Well shiiiiiit
---
Are you serious?
---
Lol the first week xur sold that shit ain't nobody got it, I did and used it to find it was amazing then a month or so later it started gaining a ton of hype but Xur only sold it for the first 2 weeks and then didn't sell it again. It was the most sought after weapon in D1 for the longest time.
---
everything except the fated engram is the same as if you've pulled it from collections. garbage stats and the same elemental affinity every time. they've said it's a bug and it's not supposed to be this way, but it's been like this since shadowkeep and they haven't said when they're actually going to fix it. maybe the beginning of next season if we're lucky.
---
And it's complete shit
---
I have no idea whether or not this was intentional.
---
Annndddddd u guessed it another
---
Ill kill all of you
---
"Invader on the field"   
---
Blueberry goes hunting for Motes 13-15
---
I‚Äôve ran Bergusia forge two or three times now following a guide to the letter but it didn‚Äôt work and I did two other forges following the guide for the other keys but I never got the keys in my director.
---
This weeks nightfall, it's easy to miss the last champ near the drill bits..
---
If you are willing to drop like 90 bucks. The collectors edition for shadow keep is on sale again. And for the being nauseous. Try playing with the settings a bit. Especially motion blur.

https://www.bungie.net/7/en/CrossSave
---
Fill out this. Make sure you use your current psn and xbox accounts. And just follow the prompts. It will ask you at one point to select the account to be the primary, and that means which account will be accessible from the other accounts. So you'll select xbox, and then your xbox characters will be the only ones on your account, and signing in on ps4 will show those characters too.
---
Remember, use your current accounts, or the ones you play on. Using wrong or old accounts will give you headaches, you can stop the crosssave but you can't activate it again for something like 60-90 days. So get it right the first time and you'll be good to go.
---
exactly, Bank 5 immediately though, put some distance between you and the other team.
---
Making the game free was one of the biggest mistakes known to man.
---
Oh lord don't quit a match.
---
Log out and back in. If that doesn't fix it play another match. The log out should work.
---
Sometimes, when two guardians love each other very very much...
---
950 drops all the time. 952 are the pinnacle bounties. Have you not done it yet?
---
Update your graphics drivers.
---
The game itself works fine. Whatevers wrong with performance will always be on the users end unless its a known issue.
---
I thought about it... but I dont like the taste of crayons.
---
Yep. He has no idea what to do first. And I said you can do anything you want. Crucible, Strikes, patrolling and doing public events. Literally anything will level you up, which is his true priority right now. 
---
Doing Forsaken campaign will lead you nowhere, bub. I know from personal experience.  
---
*Incoming short reply with insult due to lack of an inteligent reply*
---
The weapons models will forever be gone, but there wasn't anything exclusive about the traits, weapon or stats that they came with. You can easily get similar and better weapons.
---
We updated windows and gpu drivers. Along with tweaking in game settings. No matter what it stutters
---
And BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM! Dredgen Yor is dead......finally after decades possibly centuries Dredgen Yor's reign of terror is over......* sigh *
---
Of course. Like everyone else here, +1 for asking. Destiny is a great community that loves to help.
---
It's like they did not care at all that you were there..
---
I see, that‚Äôs where he goes on tuesdays wednesdays and thursdays
---
What a coincidence, i literally just did the exact same thing, 20 kills without dying and ending up top. I'd show you but i can't comment with pictures.
---
You cant even join someone in the mission without doing the steps. No shortcuts
---
Depends. Do you have friends?
---
I know you really want the shell but I'm just keeping it 100 with you, that bitch blow up like shooting legos with a 50 cal. There just ain't no way to fix.
---
Literally anything or everything cayde said in forsaken before he died.
---
I believe everyone needs to have the fallen transponder to even start the mission.
---
Funny part is that this is the nr 1 google search result. Your point is mute
---
So to clarify....even tho I have the fallen transponder.....even tho I can start the mission to get outbreak perfected.....every one in my fireteam has to also have the fallen transponder in order to get outbreak perfected?
---
Might be a quest item you already got before. Were you playing with someone?
---
No but i did stormcaller to win from a clutch then dropped electric jazz hands in D1!
