As a hunter, I hate Titan charge. But well done, regardless.

---
Touch my bae and *PERISH*
---
That‚Äôs why, the average player is 700+ because the power surge brings you to 690
---
Spent 6 hours on the boss last night and didn‚Äôt get it :( light levels were fine, trying again tonight

This isn't an LFG sub.

It's possible to throw the batteries directly into the forge from the islands. Might take a couple of tries to get it right but since I usually find teammates through the matchmaking and their ability could be great or awful, I learned to throw straight in. Also helps people that are on top if they're too busy with ads.
---
Just forge the frame in the Bergusia forge
---
I see. 
---
Should I put off doing this stuff until I'm at 700? If so, what event should I do instead to get there a little faster?
---
it would be nice if bungie would add him in as an NPC like elder scrolls did, just as a sign of respect.
---
i‚Äôm really sorry for your loss man.
---
I suppose I could practice doing that. It'll take a ton of tries, though.
---
Yes. what platform are you on?
---
I haven't done it for a while, but off of memory, aiming for the outer ring on the center platform it usually curves into the forge pretty well.
---
Lol. If you're letting a team have time to team shot you in your GG, you're doing something wrong. This might be a case of hunter-itis.
---
 "Ugh I can't aim and keep dying even though I can one shot anybody instantly. Buff pls bungo"
---
People like you are why fist of havoc and spectral blades got so good. "I'm bad with this so it must be bad"
---
I'll give that a try if I have no luck. Or, I guess I could just wait until I'm a higher light lvl and matchmake that way. Didn't realize that was my problem, just thought no one was interested in this content.
---
Iron Banner is next week! I would finish it up in IB. Ikelos was the best Void HC for me.
---
it's about to be LoW come Iron Banner
---
Ah I see, thanks you the tip
---
If you got the Rat King, it should be in your primary slot. I'm assuming you haven't. If you open up the menu with the map and destinations on it, the pursuits tab should be on the very left. The quest step is very vague, so I would recommend using a guide to figure it out.
---
This should be deleted immediately. That is the world train center in the back ground. Have some class Reddit.
---
Bungie will just nerf it.
---
hope it doesn't take a season
---
hide and seek
---
Seems like a giant pyramid on the top left.
---
Are you saying you‚Äôre gonna switch from PC to PS4???
---
What you would do is make the solid works file and send it to a rapid prototyping company. I‚Äôd just search craigslist
---
He needs the scritches
---
i need help setting it up too!
---
you get increased super regen from the 3rd round of gambit, and it stacks with shards of galanor the same way it does in blind well or mayhem. also you might have broken my headphones.
---
If it's this open ended maybe go on destinytracker to see what the most used pvp weapons are and go from there if you're new. If not, we need more intel guardian
---
*chuckles* I‚Äôm in danger
---
That‚Äôs a yikes my dude. 
---
Nice bait tho.
---
Keep trying, might catch someday.
---
Mine's on its way
---
How about you start?
---
What?
---
Isn‚Äôt that the same pattern used in the halo 3 DaVinci code Easter egg?
---
OH. I thought this was supposed to be some kind of meme or something, i didn‚Äôt realize this was a bug/glitch
---
Everything. 
---
When your done with that. Farm resources till you have 3k of everything and maxed shards and dust.
---
I always call it the anus
---
World train centre
---
Absolutely!  I cannot think of a top 10 but I can think of some.
---
1) Level cap and try to get to 700 power
---
2) get the ace of spades, especially for crucible use
---
3) get into a clan and have a blast, by making friends.(you can never have to many)
---
4) try to get the seasonal rewards for crucible
---
5) do as many raids as possible. 
---
Now its everyone else‚Äôs turn! Have fun!
---
I like it I like it. But what happens if someone can‚Äôt get everything done in time. What would you focus more on?
---
Doesn't explain the meme.
---
hahahahahaha.
---
I guess I'll never get that rematch. We will miss you.
---
Did you know him?
---
Try running Gambit prime with something like a 6 shot golden gun. Go to the other side with with heavy and your super charged when they all stand on the pad to deal damage to the primeval. You‚Äôll get it done in no time.
---
Gotta admit, I'm one of the club too.
---
This reminds me of that weird fucking fanart with Sonic the Hedgehog as a toilet
---
I like to cover people with solar grenades via sunbracers.
---
Super fun if someone else does it too
---
Thanks, I hate it
---
You‚Äôll do fine. Dying doesn‚Äôt set you back at all, it just slows you down. I think I did my first run at around 703 and it wasn‚Äôt too bad, just took a bit longer than it does now that I‚Äôm like 740 or so.
---
Is that calus's selected i see?
---
yes sir!
---
He shat in the toilet
---
MY MOUTH!!!!
---
ITS A MASSACRE.. I'm trying to get her to draw more characters so I'll post them on here for sure if she does.
---
Outstanding move
---
It‚Äôs really stressing me out that he‚Äôs just chillin there instead of running to get the chest as many times as possible üôÇ
---
Reckoning is mind numbingly boring and no longer relevant.  Menagerie at least has replay value.  People only play Reckoning for the rewards, which are powerful drops and a &lt;0.1% chance at getting something you want.  
---
If you're a PC PvP player and want the best legendary handcannon in the game, well guess what.  Stay away from comp.  Stay away from PvP.  Stay away from anything you'd find enjoyable, and instead run the reckoning or Gambit prime for thousands of hours.  Season of Opulence?  More like Season of Obsolete legendary handcannon.  Stay away from Season of Opulence my PvP loving friend, all your best loot can be found locked behind triple RNG buried deep in last season's boring content.
---
The helmet stayed on

Its in the sidebar under flair options I think

I seriously hope you drive off a bridge

Forsaken, Annual Pass and Shadowkeep won't be free.
---
these shaders drop from dismantling curated rolls of black armory weapons
---
I got a Hammerhead with Bergusian Night shader a few weeks ago
---
they droop just like the J√∂tunn and Le Monarque
---
P.S. Curated roll of any of the black armory weapons come fully masterworked
---
We will watch your career with great interest
---
Yup agreed
---
For a moment, I thought that hunter was Tali.
---
The Astrocyte Verse
---
I don't get it.
---
Erentil is more of the issue than pre-charge. Being able to properly time your charge/shot is the skill factor for fusion rifles. Erintil is the extreme outlier because of its tight bolt spread and range. Other fusions are good with a god roll but erintil is pretty nasty even with a garbage roll. Compare the spread of loaded question with erintil, they don't even feel like the same type of weapon.
---
Think of pre-charge like ADS for a sniper, it would kill the guns usage if you had to shoot every time you decided to ADS.
---
yeeeeeeeeeeeep crucible is not my stuff. Played against a 5 stack in quick play, their top guy tbagged me for no reason, so I got last kill on him out of his Fists of Havoc and tbagged him for like 15 seconds. 
---
I‚Äôve my whispers set to all and he immediately sent me a friend request, presumably to talk shit. Declined that reaaaaal fast. I‚Äôll stick to my LFG raids now lol
---
If you are going to add Outbreak Perfected to the quest pool, I would add Whisper of the Worm as well. Suggestion.
---
Yes, please look out for some of my Acolytes. I worry about them when they wonder off far from my Dreadnought
---
For anyone who can't snipe or gets teammates who keep stealing your heavy, just pop your goldie and get that easy army of one.
---
so by your own admission you've only read the first paragraph yet felt the need to critique my post based on it?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
1. cant play raids if you don't have people to do them with, same goes for nightfall's
---
2. i don't ever play crucible and never will, same for gambit
---
3. yes 4 bounties per day, well if you only have 1 day a week to play where does that leave you?
---
4. i'm still to low of a light level to play anything outside of forsaken content, again no friends and no time to play outside of a few hours a week and you become stuck in a low level content drought.
---
It would be four just 24 hours tho. I've done all the raids legit and I still think that it would be fun to chuck nova bombs at kalli like they were grenades. Of course triumphs like the flawless run shouldn't count
---
Curse us all and reveal to us this vile picture!
---
Whisper is good but it‚Äôs not technically a quest gun and they butchered it. I might make another page for the remainder of the quests though if that seems to be something people want.
---
Chuck those novas like they are grenades
---
what do you mean, they are clearly grenades
---

---
No the quest is bugged atm and we are waiting for the hotfix.
---
I have a habit of accidentally bagging. I try to dodge (I‚Äôm on ps4) but I don‚Äôt have my dodge so I end up bagging them and I‚Äôm just like ‚Äúshit I didn‚Äôt mean to do that‚Äù. I also do that when I switch to my warlock and forget I‚Äôm not on my hunter anymore LUL. But I wish I had the courage to lfg raid. I‚Äôve had bad experiences with lfg in the past so I‚Äôm always really scared to use it now
---
Where's Ace
---
You should be able to reinstall the game via the library and not have to use the disk.
---
Are there any forums or dev notes that I can follow up on later?
---
Not that im aware of.
---
Mine have been 99% great, but I‚Äôm PC. Just a few times where people got frustrated :/ 
---
But yea tbagging on PC is almost always intentional and I‚Äôm someone who does it for kicks, like bottom fragging and solo supering their top player and tbagging  but if I get tbagged first, I just try and make sure I get the last laugh
---
Blursed artwork.
---
With four lines of description there wasn‚Äôt enough space for all quest exotics

I'd love this, maybe even remove powerful drops too or it's a little one sided. Would be awesome fun running baths or Argos with this lol

Is it any good?
---
Yes! Just picked up a 750 thunderlord from a nightfall drop
---
I don‚Äôt really see how they‚Äôre any stronger than anything else?
---
Have you tried bottom tree striker Titan lately it‚Äôs possibly the best and longest lasting super in the game if you can chain your kills.
---
So basically you‚Äôre critiquing the game when you don‚Äôt play half of its content, you refuse to use LFG, you don‚Äôt feel like grinding in the game based around grinding (Bungie literally have you guys a catch-up mechanic), AND THEN you assume that thousands of people are in the same boat.
---
Try not to hit the door on the way out.
---
r/fireteams. Get outta here quick before the mods arrive.
---
That‚Äôs the only decent Titan subclass, Hunters have the best neutral game out of any class other than maybe warlock, middle tree night stalker is broken and rewards you for doing basically nothing, middle tree arc staff negates every other super in the game other and slowva bomb.
---
Titans have one exotic that‚Äôs any good in high ranked play(One eyed) which people nonstop complain about, when the middle tree nightstalker legit lets you see the entire enemy team, wall hacks style, and you go invisible, and your melee does more damage, and that‚Äôs not even mentioning their exotics
---
Hunters are busted plain and simple
---
Before I unleash all hell, what class do you main? And do you have any mental conditions?

---
Don't like it. Would be like binge-drinking: The hangover the next day when things are back to normal would spoil it for me. I am still missing the pre-nerf Skull-experience.
---
Unfortunately you can use any gun, doesn‚Äôt make a difference :( still easy
---
I just ran through Crown for the first time the other day and didn't see the need to use my super once. Loaded question was doing more damage than hammers. Titan supers are fucking useless right now.
---
Yep. I entered the Menagerie for the first time at 695 and got destroyed because some of the encounters are at 710 - 720 ish. I want to sit comfortably at 730 before I do it again.
---
I hate the music most of all, i play the game evreyday and they have world ending music. Same gripe i have with ark
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm wondering too. God I
---
Hope not
---
Do daily challenges and weekly ones. Oh and if you have season pass then go and talk to benedict in tower and werner on nessus
---
The only time that max light/power level has ever mattered is Iron Banner and OG trials. That's just my opinion though.
---
MEGA CHOC
---
CHOC'D FULL OF DISAPPOINTMENT.
---
Warmind and curse of Osiris we‚Äôre released free and gambit was included too I believe. Also you can‚Äôt just buy forsaken now, it comes bundled with the annual pass for $40, though if u only have forsaken the annual pass has been reduced to around $18 or so, so I‚Äôd recommend getting it.
---
zkmushroom as a) he‚Äôs console, like me, and b) he seems totally salt-free and just loves playing. His LoW video (that seemed to actually hit before the Aztecross one) was refreshingly free of NERF THIS NOW! And was more, hey! This is insane and cool, try it out. The only dude I watch. Low sodium diet, live longer.

Thanks for sharing that. I‚Äôm sure your friend will never forget that.

Thank you

Yeah its a hint to that... if you check the triumph to get 500 kills with it, its called clean up on aisle five
---
Amazing
---
Cammycakes, CoolGuy, Aztecross, Apathettic
---
When? I thought he said the opposite
---
Leviathan and last wish are good imo the others are short ass hell. I know crotas end was short top but the mood and feel was far better.
---
Why not go back to the smooth destiny 1 rise of iron, the taken king or original
---
Still better than getting graviton lance from last wish

Classic handheld bullet
---
Basically all of the year 1 items (weapons and armor) can be pulled out of your collections now at the cost of shards and glimmer. All ghosts, sparrows and ships can be too at the cost of glimmer, shards and I think sometimes bright dust.
---
Since basically all the year 1 weapons and armor are now useless due to having fixed perks instead of the new random-rolled perks, you can safely dismantle them all, knowing that if there's any you like the look of you can always pull them out of your collections later.
---
Once you start collecting post-forsaken gear, it will say above the stats that it has random rolls and therefore can't be pulled out of collections. Those are the ones you don't want to dismantle unless you don't like the stats or dont ever intend to use them.
---
Hopefully that helps :)

Outbreak perfected quest
---
Complete the ‚ÄúEnemy of my Enemy‚Äù quest line and return to this door later. You‚Äôll find the start to an exotic quest (one I would highly recommend pursuing)
---
If you go in there you can get the node that starts it all
---
I guess I need a refresher on the drifter lore
---
The wave is the single best emote in the game. I will fight people on this. 
---
Like a fine wine, I like to pair it with the broom.
---
You are in the mission probably Enemy of my enemy, after you have done the quest line the door will be shut, but unlocked as part of the Outbreak quest
---
i think i've to get this weapon..
---
from what quest did i got this from?
---
Why is Titan on the floor?
---
Guys ik what this is XD I got the outbreaked prefected already on my hunter and I am using the titan to do the quest to meet my boi Mithrax.
---
What is your depth of field setting at? I ask because I used to run this game on 1080P and had everything maxed and it was fine but now that I'm running it at 1440P the depth of field setting can tank my fps so now I only run it at high and still have everything else maxed.
---
Seeing this is game really sets off my OCD, your layout would make it so much easier to look at and be more helpful when farming the chests as quickly as possible
---
Can I do this for the X1 or is that just PC?  ty!
---
Did you check your vault?  
---
If you have some materials you can grab some items from collections.
---
In pvp my favourite is nova warp with contraverse holds. Top three storm caller os probably my second but top three dawn blade is pretty good when you get used to the air dodge and aiming your ult properly. 
---
In gambit I usually either go mountaintop recluse Thunder lord with well and Luna faction for prime. For normal gambit I use chaos reach with transversive steps. 
---
You can pretty much use anything in a lot of pve activities and it work reasonably well.
---
üé∂Hello Otherside Sparrow, my old friend...üé∂
---
üé∂I‚Äôve come to talk with you again...üé∂
---
Which app?
---
What armor set is that for the warlock?
---
One of the best uses of this meme I‚Äôve seen, well done
---
Once you unlock dredged in game, how much does one cost?
---
I got the ghost shell from the blind well.
---
Okay but why I can not buy the forsaken DLC separately? On Xbox One I only find forsaken with destiny 2, but I already have it...
---
How long did it end up taking? Waiting on my Wayfarer pin.
---
My guess would be you do but it'll be locked to level 50. Not certain though.
---
Losing someone close to you is always a horrible time in one's life, he sounds like a great guy. Very sorry for your loss bud.

What the unholy fuck is that shader?
---
Right, but it did happen. I'm not gonna be mad if you dont believe me since I didn't take a screenshot.
---
don't we all
---
I wouldn‚Äôt know tbh, I play it on PC and I only have the base game and waiting for it to launch on steam.
---
But if I would guess, based on all the offers, all new DLCs include the previous DLCs and content for free. So technically you are only paying for the latest DLC.
---
Just a guy being a dude.

My guess would be the urinal bit him when... you know...

but I am really not sure that's it.

Lol that's how I feel with the lamplighting doors

He got overshields literally 1 time during all that
---
1) if you look on your screen when standing on well it will tell you which button. Default is square.
---
2) look at your chalice in pursuits. It tells you how many powerful remain

Thanks for the clarification....i appreciate.
---
I swear she had cotton candy officer! It was there .2 seconds ago.
---
What story?
---
Reaper gambit prime from the looks of it
---
He's shocked/terrified
---
This would be cool if raids were based on actual combat and not gimmick voice chat puzzles
---
Yeah
---
Missile with syntho still does significantly less damage than than Nova/GG/Barrage, all while putting yourself into a very dangerous situation. High risk, low reward.
---
Ugh.....stop
---
Raids are supposed to be the most difficult activities. I think doing this would ruin them also remove the satisfaction of the people who really beat it to get the rare gear.
---
All your characters share the vault so if you wanted to get a new character that was the same class you could keep the armor. I usually store special weapons and armor. Things that you dont necessarily find all the time. Iron Banner seasonal armor or raid gear for example
---
I always keep that sonuvabitch in my inventory, on all characters, like a four leaf clover. I never have that fucker drop anymore.
---
I understand the issue, but not all players running through Zone A have the intention of just racking up kills. Especially on certain maps, a shotgun has a distinct advantage when making it to Zone B first to ensure Zone Advantage. Sure, a grenade can get mobbed in there, but a titan at least can throw up a barricade to help his chances. 
---
Now, I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs justified if all five of your team mates running OEM and DRB completely abandon A, but a team spreading out to cover two zones to gain advantage Advantage first *can* be a tactical move.
---
You are just sad because you lost.
---
Weird you are getting downvoted. I agree. Dumbing down the raids with stuff like this would ruin them
---
I think so, go on bungie.net
---
&gt;High risk, low reward.
---
High fun though, the yeet subclass is great \^\^
---
Don‚Äôt insult daddy Calus you heathen
---
Yea, we have been looking at the foreskin long enough,show us more!
---
The point of a UV grid is to assure that the unwrap is straight for future material development. It can look like anything as long as it can serve that aforementioned function.
---
Waiting for savathun to reply
---
that's a damn war crime.
---
Prayers going up to God for you, his family, and friends.
---
I'd also suggest doing bounties for spider if you have the dlc, otherwise look at the destination screen and do heroic events and strikes to help boost your gear
---
So you're saying tether everything?
---
Ayy it's mister whiner. Still complaining I see.
---
I've been pleasantly surprised by getting two  to drop this week and my exotic drops for last week were on vanilla levels of drop rate it was so nice to actually get exotics for once
---
Probably unpopular opinion: I really miss the Warmind loading screen.
---
Since I just started playing Destiny around this time last year, the Warmind loading screen became iconic for me and really grabbed me into the music of Destiny.
---
Just disable all the raid mechanics as well.
---
I appreciate your reply but like I said: *just in case* people didn't know. I'm just trying to help. So sorry if it came out wrong. I'm seriously just trying to raise awareness. I didn't know about these till after half a year if playing.
---
All titan subs are good mainly in pvp, I feel like y'all are forced mainly to rely on optimal weapon loadouts rather than super in pve. I mean, maybe just run bubble or hammer for melting point or whatever that debuff melee is.
---
Come again?
---
Calus can wish in one hand and...  well you know.
---
Nah but if imma post it to reddit I‚Äôd wanna make sure I don‚Äôt get lambasted for a repost
---
Have I done something to offend you? lmao
---
You've posted about me complaining a lot on both threads.
---
Try the LFG on Bungies Destiny app.
---
Actualky doing faction events would help with this too. Its been a while since one of them unless I missed one while I was on hiatus from d2.
---
Sorry man
---
Not alot just two comments. I just don't like all the negativity it's not you sorry man.
---
Wait that‚Äôs illegal
---
Has Bungie even mentioned D3?
---
I‚Äôm also waiting on the points to get fabled and I get Luna‚Äôs

maybe it's still a UV grid of sorts, but I don't think the numbers are a color ID map, or any type of map.

Rule 16 - - Direct-capture screenshots only.

I like your fancy hat, Titan.
---
What about specific standard
---
Using the wrong controller brudda! I rock the Steam Controller and the gyro + trackpads suite me quite well vs. normal analog sticks.
---
What about pacific standard time
---
Ah ok, thank you!
---
Nothing beats King's Fall imo
---
Oh really? Is it worth it cause its already season of opulence and since my parents make me buy videogames with my own money (which IMO is unfair because I can't get a job since underage and I have no other way of making money)
---
So I either get annual pass or shadow keep which 1 is more worth it?
---
I always thought our ghost was our biggest fan, but after this season, I guess its actually Calus
---
Your more looking for range and consistency, so try to find eye of the storm and rangefinder. it is one of the best rolls to get
---
Me, but I‚Äôm gonna buy the D1 collection this summer.
---
The way i do destiny is by leveling and then sherpa‚Äôing.  Helping others that are behind you is the best way to do a grinding game.  Also, don‚Äôt rush quests and save them for easier times after leveling.  Sometimes, you get into something as it is exciting.
---
Same here

1.4 kd or efficiency? Because you should be getting a lot of invites with a 1.4 kd

Considering the idea of a Pinnacle Weapon is for only the best and those who put in the time and skill to have it so I think the Luna‚Äôs and Recluse quests are fine.
---
Ssshhh he wants it to be a more hateful term
---
Scouts aren't "bad" but they aren't best. Currently pulses kind of hold that title.
---
A whole team capturing a point not possible
---
yeah. I might keep you in mind when I buy it
---
Yep
---
That is true, but against really competent players thats not gonna make much of a difference. In a really "sweaty" lobby, people are going to be more attentive to spawns flipping. There are many reasons why being attentive to spawn flips is important in control and other modes, but lets focus on its importance in securing kills on a power play.
---
The right play when you're about to start capping to secure the power play, is to have a part of your team pushing where the enemy is about to spawn. Usually you'd send the best slayers on the team or the ones with heavy or supers.
---
The reason why you'd want to do that before the power play happens is so that you get there in time to secure the kills and prevent them from getting the zone. This is why creating space is important. Good map movement and close attention to these small details aren't uncommon especially how quickplay is these days.
---
If you're somewhere near mythic/legend, or run into any of these players, pay attention to how they move around the map and how they are often times already closing in on you even when you've just recently spawned. Because this attention to spawns has something to do with it.
---
This was way too long, but I feel like it saves a few people from a few hatemail and I'm fine with it.

Bad clip, it did not show the bomb getting defused or blown up.
---
to be quite honest i don't remember, i just kinda got it during warmind
---
Yeah, but when people see Blackout, some people just skip or give up on the activity entirely, not knowing that it can be done. Even I was caught in this way of thinking back in T2/3 Reckoning Bridge release, that Blackout day is a no Reckoning Day. I just wanted people to give it a try first before judging. In comparison tho, Blackout Menagerie is way more manageable than Blackout Reckoning. Also, Glass can suck it.
---
You missed the point of the clip bud
---
Come at me with your trash of wolves. I have had 0 problems against this gun
---
I used to think so, but Last Wish did it for me (assuming a good raid team)
---
Vault encounter is fucking amazing

besides wrath of the machine, none of the d1 raids are better. don't let nostalgia cloud your judgement.
---
The Ripost encounter was brutle today with Blackout
---
10 outta 10, good art!
---
last wish was soloed.
---
Please Bungie, I'm begging you
---
...
---
Nah I still think it's fake.
---
If you are on xbox, be sure to use the looking for group functionality built into the dashboard. Super handy!
---
I wish they added a little flair to the screen to reflect the season, maybe like a different color of the char select with the emblem of the season overlayed on the splash screen?
---
Can‚Äôt unsee
---
I got one to drop inside rivens heart the other day then the final chest also gave me one
---
True. But honestly, we all knew the were the most fun
---
Oh yes haha they used a super to solo kill a hunter very good, but I am more interested in if the Bomb went off or not.
---
I've actually managed to get every single triumph with Blueberries, except for the first week's secret boss triumph.
---
I know, I'm still shocked too.
---
Spoiler alert: calus eats both of them amd becomes an ultra ghost and travels with you
---
I‚Äôve played through d1 but haven‚Äôt done any of the raids. I couldn‚Äôt even port my warlock from d1 to d2 because I played through d1 too late. God I wish I could have ported them.
---
I was with this really good invader who got me to 2/3, then I invaded to finish the 25 kills and got an army of one
---
He just laughed
---
Wrath was the only raid I liked and was up to do more than once.
---
Pride/stubborness alot of people get that " oh you wanna do that huh watch ill be back"* gets slaughtered again moments.
---
You should post this on the destinythegame so the devs see it.
---
Rule 4.
---
You have to use the selfie emote from Year 1.
---
Off.
---
As a human being, I am not "being offended" for you. I am "being offended" for all the people out there that don't think its funny. Just because you think its funny doesn't magically make it not insensitive. 
---
I am not disabled at all and I am personally offended as I know disabled people and this disgusted me. I'll just block you so I never have to interact with you again. 
---
I hope you become a better person in the future.
---
true, very true about the account recovery.  That was the first thing I thought of when i read the post.  oh well
---
My Sunsinger prevented many a team wipe in the Shield Brothers strike boss arena.  To rise from the dead and toss out endless fireballs like Charlie McGee in the last scene of Firestarter was such an epic way to save the day.
---
*sniff*
---
I miss Sunsinger.
---
Dam I was hoping that area was inbounds
---
Yes.Even though it isn't fully plain , it's easier to read IMHO
---
I'm at 1200 points right now. I think this will take a while.
---
Fuckin' Vuvuzela.
---
I'll do it for the armor and then no more! I'm no where near top with my light level
---
S Q U I S H
---
Ugh...I just finished the Polaris Lance quest. Other than a slightly slow ROF, I love it. Absolutely worth it for PvE. I'll stick with my Multi-Tool in PvP though.
---
Yeah, that's really condensed and pretty easy to read.
---
You're not.  I have a million or so purple runes and very few to none of the runes I need
---
Tis not new
---
ü§£, but forreal tho
---
Well I wasn't... Until now lol
---
oh my
---
You can get them whenever you're able to. Once you want it to be stronger, infuse it with Enhancement Cores and some other materials. It'll raise the weapon/armors light to that of what you infused it with. For example, I got my MIDA Micro-Tool at 215, but infused it up to my current 345.
---
I always end up with teams like this too, it hurts :(
---
Damn, I guess since I don't find dad jokes funny they're all offensive to me then. I never realized that was how it worked, thanks for letting me know!
---
Good advice with the knowing people thing too. I'll make sure that if I ever hear or see a joke that in any way indicates it could in any possible way be about a feature that someone I know has, I'll be offended on their behalf by default!
---
Croats end was by far my favorite raid, it was the first i was able to successfully complete solo. I felt amazing afyer having done so.
---
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
---
Hey sorry to jump in with a question, but how do I unlock the rest of the slots in the chalice? I‚Äôve unlocked the first, top one, did the menagerie and got a bond, now it just says continue questline to unlock the rest..... eh? How do I do that?
---
It's times like these you need to ask yourself " Did I throw enough grenades?"
---
Thanks
---
Ok cool. Now I gotta figure out how to get extra space on the canvas so I have more space for better formatting
---
Thanks, i thought the gear looked pretty sweet but i guess ill live without.
---
Wasn't he the tank and sonic the bowl?
---
Man, I had to confirm after typing that because I was like "that sounds correct, but really really stupid." But yeah, last one here (and there's also one weirdly like the comic above just worse).

The crucible needs you guardian!
---
I'm wondering if OP made this or found it on some other subreddit.
---
If only he would tell us...
---
You could always open the controller up and unplug the cable link to the circuit board.  No light fix.
---
Unga Bunga my guy
---
One of my least favorite jumping puzzles. My hands get sweaty just thinking about it
---
Yeah imagine if it explicitly said glory right in the triumph. Thatd be really insane
---
I got both of them from powerful frame drops in berguersia and then a duplicate of le monarque at izanami's forge if thats any help
---
How the fuck have you got so many runes of desire
---
I play in one character and only 2 days a week and was able to get to 750
---
For VoG or dreadnaught?
---
I KNOW right??
---
This guy really say he doesn‚Äôt like daddy Shaxx voice ?!?! 
---
You clearly didn‚Äôt throw enough grenades Guardian!!!
---
Good hunting! Keep the wall strong guardian
---
You and half my clan. I loved it, but I'm the resident floofer of my group, so I just love jumping puzzles.
---
It's literally a physical difference in regards to lord of wolves, but ok.

Atheon should be there...not Crota

Honestly feels like -300 üòÇ

Went to melting point the minotaur in crystals.. did not live to take advantage of the debuff.
---
PSA. Don‚Äôt grind for calculated trajectory in Iron Banner. The medal is not awarded.
---
I got rampage with adaptive , snap shot and full bore. Not to shoddy
---
I'll have to give it a shot I have a ps4 controller coming in from battle beaver customs also but I love having options
---
I‚Äôm in this picture and I don‚Äôt like it
---
On the xbox store it's not sold by itself even though it's listed. It just redirects to the complete edition.
---
Don't forget the Spider...those Etheric Spirals aren't going to collect themselves!
---
900 IQ, I'm gonna do that when I get home.
---
Literally unplayable
---
Neither was I, honestly.
---
Light level plays a big part currently
---
Speaking of Vex, I remember in D1, some the FWC talked about how they never saw a future with Vex technology where Guardians win. But then I remember hearing something about the Vex can't accurately predict a Guardian themselves. Did they ever expand on that?
---
I was afraid of that :( less pvp and more gear v gear
---
Ah, I haven't logged in yet. I thought it was part of another quest or something. Thanks!
---
I got one the other day.
---
Maybe quit bitching? Choose a different helmet? Just an idea.
---
Look for the "legendary collection," that will give you Forsaken, with the base game free. It's not possible to buy Forsaken without also getting the base game free with it, just so you know. On PC, it's much cheaper to get the legendary collection from third party retailers such as amazon, but I don't know if that's also the case on xbox.
---
Congrats dude! It looks awesome!
---
Yes and they all year one...
---
[yes, but actually no](https://i.imgur.com/DZCLx5Q.png)
---
Ur a god, and I‚Äôm just hella dumb
---
Not one for the samurai aesthetic?
---
But then you cant use the broken Lord of Wolves
---
Skill still definitely plays the biggest part though. You'll just die or kill a bit quicker
---
Dont kill the knights.   
---
Proceeds to kill the knights
---
I think the hunter armor looks cool but the warlock is bulky and the helmet looks weird to me. The titan armor is okay I guess.
---
if only we had a good primary legendary. ooh spare rations is a thing
---
I remember an article where Bungie said they are adding in cross progression to make is that you can transfer stuff from pc to console and I was curious if they have given an official date? I love the game but I can‚Äôt play on my computer because it‚Äôs so bad so I‚Äôm hoping that it comes quick! Or at least before Shadowkeep so I can get caught up.
---
yes.  You'll have to rebuy Forsaken, the Annual Pass, and the new DLC if you want any of that content.
---
Here's a photoshop preset that I made to get other icons animated:

Yea, r/DestinyTheGame is the main/official one. There's some great in depth info there, but there seems to be way more salty gatekeepers there than here on r/destiny2. r/raidsecrets is a bunch of brainiacs that figure out secrets and glitches, develop great strategies (especially for raids). r/fireteams is where you go for LFG if you aren't on xbox. r/DestinySherpa is where you go if you need a guide for a raid or whatever. r/DestinyMemes is pretty self-explanatory. And then r/CruciblePlaybook is the main one I know for PvP guides/questions.
---
Those are the main ones I know of, but of course there's tons more.
---
I learned most of what I know from coming here to r/destiny2 and just browsing through new posts, after a while I started posting my own questions, then I started trying to help by answering questions I knew the answer to.
---
You might also benefit from finding someone to do the refer-a-friend quest if you purchase Forsaken. You can probably find someone on r/DestinySherpa or r/Fireteams that will be your guide for it.
---
It definitely gets confusing, but that's one of the things I love about it. Learning new stuff the more I play it, helping others, keeping up with the changes. It keeps it engaging for me.
---
No one's forcing you to play it.
---
So fucking sick of Gambit
---
Console blues :(
---
Just so you know, the civic duty bounties count for that. You don't need to do gambit at all.
---
I like gambit :)
---
D2 players with mild to moderate ocd UNITE!
---
These are cool. One thing...it might be helpful to note the name of the specific Ascendant Challenge each week in addition to just the Lost Sector or region where you get to it. This week is Cimmerian Garrison in Chamber of Starlight.
---
I got 3 exotic drops today.
---
welcome to crown of sorrow.
---
Lolz. I see what you did there
---
I see what you did there
---
Have my upvote
---
Lone?
---
Yes, it's all happening September 17 when Shadowkeep releases
---
Where do you find those mythical creatures? all i find is the "go clubbing, kill braincells" and "you play videogames? loser" type...
---
I will openly admit that I don't like playing PvP because I am bad at it.  In fact most of the time I'm absolute trash at it.  I can manage to get the quest steps for exotics that require crucible done and that's about it.  All of the Crucible Pinnacles, with the exception of maybe Redrix are far beyond my skill to acquire.
---
Everyone has to deal with it though, just accept that someone else is having fun pressing a button. Let them eat cake, respawn. If it‚Äôs golden gun then tip your hat, because it‚Äôs a woman/man of culture.
---
Baby Calus. Calus Jr.
---
On xbox too a little honestly, but it will be alright.
---
Chocolates!
---
I think you do need the forsaken DLC, the annual pass only give extra content that only can be accessed if you have the DLC.
---
How you access it sucks too tho...
---
How do I get the blue ones?
---
I understand it can go both ways, I have people I play with who absolutely love PvP, and your reasoning is completely understandable, I'm not shitting on PvP players at all, I'm just saying as a primarily PvE player having crucible in my quest objectives is really frustrating, and I'll openly admit that I'm bad at crucible. For the last part that is absolutely true, I struggled to get Thorn but did it just because I love it's design.

Why have you cursed me with this knowledge.

Imo there should be a hotfix to that gun this is worse than the laser show back with polaris
---
Guess you like black Armory gear (hunter)
---
Use "request desktop site" to use full quality images.
---
I just started actually it‚Äôs pretty fun probably best to get caught up and see if you wanna keep playing the new expansion
---
I was confused as hell about everyone freaking out about it till I saw some pc gameplay...holy shit
---
You put my child down THIS INSTANT!!
---
After like 5 times its like its always been there, for me at least...
---
I've seen like 3 of them in the past 2 weeks. I think Bungie screwed something up.
---
Fair enough haha
---
EZ
---
You gotta unlock the armor first, it literally says it in the update
---
Try it with skullfort you'll be doing this a lot
---
L M N LoW Q R S... I dont get it? 
---
Legit took me a bit on this one.
---
No. It won't.  This has heen a thing since d1. Stop being a subhuman liar dude. Bungie even confirmed in d1 that they dont care
---
Still not liking the horns on the helmets
---
Someone told me those expacks were free with the plus version
---
Who's cutting onions?
