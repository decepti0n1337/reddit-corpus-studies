While we are talking about skil [sic], I'd like to take a moment to thank all of the bosses for being so big that I can no-scope them with my sniper rifle.  Evolutionary pressure would suggest that having a smaller hit box and moving constantly would be advantageous, but that is not what we observe.  So thanks again, bosses, for being giant lumbering bullet sponges.
---

---
---
---
Did I though? Because with fixed rolls, you will always see weapon 4 over weapon 7, with the game as it is now, I see different weapons used all the time. It makes for a much more enjoyable experience if you actually play the game
---
Upvote for honesty, lol.
---
I have the curtain call one from Warmind. Perfect to be that guy when waiting in Gambit.
---
Yes, cluster bombs work so well because Riven is giant, and if you shoot them inside her mouth all the cluster bombs directly hit, so it does way more damage than anything else. This includes Thunderlord, Whisper of the Worm, and Prospector. Though if you do not have any rocket launchers with cluster bomb, I have heard Prospector works. 
---
Thanks! I made them with my wife‚Äôs Cricut machine. Found the parade emblems online and went to dafont.com and downloaded ‚Äúfuturist fixed‚Äù which is the closest thing to the destiny font I could find. 
---
Why don't you learn to use fucking Google and shut the fuck up... entitled shits again...
---
You can try /r/Fireteams, /r/FireteamsPS4, the official Destiny 2 app, this subreddit's discord server (link in top right) or the /r/DestinyTheGame discord server (link in their sidebar). 
---
Haha. That‚Äôs actually me. You might have to join up to know the story behind that one. 
---
Only on PC..üòë
---
Both are trash üòé
---
Your original argument was they made Halo but the Halo people moved on.
---
You‚Äôre just looking to shit in Activision and praise Bungie when the latter is still to blame for a lot of the issues. 
---
It‚Äôs funny you mention Call it Duty and Battlefront when they fucked everything D1 had and ignored it when D2 launched. It was the *same game* as vanilla Destiny. 
---
Bungie really fucked that up. 
---
Hallowfire Heart isn‚Äôt a Forsaken exotic, but congrats on getting two drops! 
---
Thanks!!! I‚Äôve been wanting to do something like this for my clan when we host events with prizes. I‚Äôll have to look into getting one. I‚Äôm sure your friends will love it.
---
Is that a sick joke? Random rolls make the game even more monotonous haha without fixed rolls to provide balance, EVERY one chases the same OP weapons. It's the worst state crucible has ever been in, it's so boring
---
Was thinking about the Aegis Shield the other day and realized that it was an early version of the Sentinel Shield for Titans
---
There's also the problem where Dice is a subsidiary of EA and not simply on contract. The studio cannot leave EA without EA selling it off.
---
Try to support your team more.
---
Thank you. I‚Äôm very excited! Be careful with that cricut machine, it can easily become a new obsession. So many cool things to do. 
---
There are a few lost sectors in the dreaming city that have a jumping skip that take you right to the final mini bosses
---
You are right!
---
You need multiple headshots for this, it would be effective vs bosses. But in pvp I‚Äôd choose outlaw over this anytime.
---
Stop playing with idiot randos, find some other good players and friend them
---
So what do you think the point of increasing light level is if  it doesn't get you anything?
---
Good luck! If you're on ps4, I'd be happy to hop in and give y'all some tips if you get stuck again.
---
Yes, some exotics come from quests and others are extremely rare drops from any activity. 
---
Honestly I‚Äôll be shocked if destiny 3 is self published. 
---
Also the user can get damage from the explosion if to close to the target.
---
it gives you the ability to do raids and other non PVP stuff?
---
I have the same Roll it's nutty 
---
It's a random drop for Scourge of the Past Raid in the EDZ
---
And then there is me with almost 9k kills on my erentil fr4 waiting to reach that 10k on the counter and keep getting hate for not going with the meta ü§ò 
---
Destiny 2 is a beautiful game that, unfortunately, lets me wriggle into the walls and see how it's all put together from the outside. Fun, but it makes the eyes bleed a bit.
---
(psst, passion )
---
I've been getting this fairly often since Forsaken released. I used to reinstall everything but have since found I could close the game (actually close, not Home button back to dashboard) and when I start it back up it's fine.
---
Hopefully that works for you as well.
---
mid range headshots and long range bodyshots are 100% luck since there is still a bit of inaccuracy, so yea it's weird,  but I was surprised by the close to mid range bodyshot consistency tbh
---
*licks lips* It's time...
---
Also code of the commander with a shield throw charge.
---
I've been playing mostly competitive shooters most of my life. Competed in CSGO, Masters in Overwatch, Amateur Quake player. This was still a grind for me that took about 3 weeks.
---
I may be free to play, but its not my first time playing competitive shooters as most of the skill set are transferable. Like when to peek corners, when to engage, disengage, etc.
---
I'm still waiting for an April Fools ship that's just a portable phalanx.
---
Yeah. When I teammed up I actually lost more progress.
---
Oh yea i feel ya just need a team that wont kick you after 1 lose is the worst part
---
IT'S A TRAP!!
---
They‚Äôre still gonna need to regain players and add new ones. It‚Äôs really hard to do that without a new base game. Expansions aren‚Äôt usually good at doing anything other than slowing down atrophy in the community. 
---
lol, I might try it then, and congrats
---
Yea that's a great strat, and as a bonus I really like the stealth dodge
---
Same shit happens for me, on ps4 lol.  I‚Äôm around a 2kd player but solo queuing is tough as shitballs.
---
Even when they‚Äôre ur allies in invasions, they are still the worst faction in gambit
---
Looks like you stubbed your toe. 
---
Lol I soloed Gambit for Malfeasance, breakneck, trust and just completed my 2nd  reset for the Curated Bad Omens. I don't know if I have it me to do another reset for the Ghost. 
---
Right for initiating tower shenanigans, left for joining it. Unless you plan on making a bonfire big enough to burn down your surroundings or you are arguing with your mates about who has the better fashion sense.
---
Congrats.
---
Everyone else is probably bitter.
---
Nice work!
---
Crucible is barely worth playing anymore and it‚Äôs kinda sad.  It‚Äôs just a dumpster fire.  Even gambit has the same issues.
---

---
Cayde died like a bitch. His rooster mains Telesto. Good riddance. 
---
Nice. I‚Äôm not over 600 yet so I feel like I‚Äôm weighing down my team and I feel really bad but normally I come out 3-4.
---
What are you even talking about
---
So wtf is it? Hate it when people don't post the reveal. 
---
Personally, I grinded for feeding frenzy and rampage, unsure if it's the God roll, but I like it a lot.
---
Lol, Just showing a picture of a list of forge recoveries doesn't say anything. Are you promoting the Recoveries yourself or are you just telling people they exist?
---
Not trying to be rude but this ain‚Äôt shit
---
I thought I was finally beginning to understand memes.
---
Nope!

Thank you very much :) i'm glad you enjoyed it

I played OG D1 but got bored once max level and never went back.  Played OG D2 and got bored at max level so stopped playing and then refused to be rap‚ô§‚ô§ by DLC.  Finally came back when Forsaken was half priced and included DLC.  Loving the game again but still haven't completed Curse or Warmind lol.  I don't know what the point of this reply is except to say not everyone enjoys being bent over with no lube by Activision so it's no surprise that not everyone played pre-Forsaken so maybe just happy that there even enough people to raid with and maybe help them along to be better players?
---
Your acting like i sit on reddit 
---
It's the stuff of nightmares
---
Carry a Sword with high guard/efficiency. 
---
I‚Äôve survived Snipers by guarding (admittedly, I haven‚Äôt tested it against QB, but I imagine you could survive a peek to tell your team where the Invader is).
---
I think the Mayhem mode should be permanent, I actually get to feel powerful and the entire game could have that recharge speed and it would only make me play it more.
---
Theres also those people who try to solo spawn kill the boss (no team coordination/preparation) with there super and heavy and then an invader comes in a second later and heals the primeval to full health again. What a waste. I know good teams can do that but as a solo player. I wait for the first invader to come kill them and wait for a primeval slayer of atleast √ó3. Unless the enemy has their primeval then I'll go at √ó2.
---
I don't play titan in crucible lmao secondly no one uses a script to titan skate its either a macro or a scroll wheel  also i can warlock skate it's so easy lmao 
---
Yeah, but that's like saying that it takes more skill to use a fork than it does a spoon. Sure they both do different things, but it's still pretty damn easy to use both of 'em.
---
I'd say it's kinda true but some are not so easy but when all you use is a shotty in crucible you know that you need to kiss you sister you fucking pacific archeology loving trpstland fucking warlock titan o sexual. -made by ada gang.
---
If you're going for Boss DPS then High-Impact with Dynamic Sway will be a good option. Put a Backup Mag on it and it should throw it to 73 rounds. More ammo overall and just a bit more damage buffed rounds.
---
And those do what?
---
Extra damage towards the primeval 
---
"Clean up on aisle five"
---
Use Jotunn
---
Sad they nerfed 1k
---
Fyi since you seem slow we've had 2 complete sets of iron banner armor with no ornament slots yet. food for thought 
---
Knowing Destiny, probably a duplicate. Lol.
---
Nicely done!
---
"I want to be able to easily learn how to play this cool looking game at a basic level"
---
"Shut the fuck up... entitled shit"
---
You are literally the problem kiddo
---
If explanations on how to do basic tasks arent included in a game, its a badly designed game. And this is coming from someone who enjoys playing D2
---
Yes. Just look at the armor/weapon in your collections and it will be listed there. 
---
hell yeah man
---
Wow you rock
---
How am I supposed to know anything if you don't post it?
---
Returning guardian on PC. Haven't played since release due to work and travel. New job and back in the swing of things. I play a Titan but I have a lot of leveling to do. Just looking for a casual clan to join. My btag is brofoo#1110
---
This is quality advice. Thank you
---
Got jotunn second try but i know the pain
---
Yup. As long as you have the dlc containing an exotic they drop (not including quest specifics of course). 
---
Have the same set up except rampage instead of kill clip 
---
Only helpful when playing with a fireteam and a mic, unfortunately, but I find success keeping a sword on me anyway. 
---
Good for high damage on targets that are too close for explosives, timed swings and blocking negate Primeval stomps, and you can sometimes catch an Invader by surprise if they rush you without Super behind cover. 
---
The Exotic Black Talon has a decent tracking projectile attack (won‚Äôt beat a Queenbreaker, but it‚Äôll wreck an Invader in pursuit or trying to use a rocket launcher).
---
This...this and this...  Just give me clash once....
---
They‚Äôre completely invisible and have damage resistance. It may not be hard but it ain‚Äôt easy for sure.
---
I would like to share my experience. I finished the heroic event and my quest didn't complete, so I came here to inform myself of what was I doing wrong. I read I had to go to hollows so I went there immediately (didn't even go to orbit after completing the event) and, to my surprise, the quest immediately advanced to the next step (killing the minotaurs). Hope this helps.
---
If you are using it in and amongst enemies (sitting in well not worried about adds) Surrounded perk is what you want. It will actually give you a damage buff of 40-50% depending if you add a Surround Spec Mod. This is much better than Kill clip or Rampage as they require you to kill adds constantly. Whereas Surrounded allows you to do continue Boss damage as long as your near enemies.     
---
Warlock one is off at the end.  It‚Äôd be awesome if we got a little lift towards the end of the jump, but we just float straight down.

Had a match today where a bunch of my teammates all had great KD.... But we lost because nobody wanted to capture the points.  literally got back to back power plays .
---
You can tell which week it is by what the Dreaming City looks like. [Here is an album of screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/U3CvlXm) comparing the first and third weeks. If you don't want to physically travel there, look at where Petra is. 
---
The Strand: First, least cursed week
---
Divalian Mists: Second, middle week
---
Rheasilvia: Third, most cursed week.
---
I hope one day we got a VR version of Destiny pve 
---
*Cries in peasant-like 50 clears*

For a completely separate (new) ip. Won't be Destiny branded. 
---
I'd also encourage you to look into the company via wiki. Appears they've helped blizzard funding/server (?) Wise with a few of their games. Otherwise it's just getting them into China. (Can't really remember right now)
---
Submit this to aztecross he‚Äôd lose this shit lol 
---
If you can find one person, it only took me and one other guy to 200k The Insight Terminus. Doomfang, I ran middle tree sentinel and my friend ran bottom tree. Void singe+grenadier, 100 light deficit, gave us I think a 4.18 multiplier. Could probably figure out similar combos based on your classes/light.
---
&gt;Is there the possibility of bungie changing the launcher and losing the buy? 
---
There is no chance of that. This game will stay on the Battle.net launcher. 
---
I have to close tomorrow. Thank you for this sir. You made future me's night.
---
Blizzard has already been confirmed that Destiny 2 will stay on Battle.net with zero interruption. It's safe.
---
Recently too
---

That's just dirty
---
Why is that noteworthy? This cheese is just to allow four people to survive the sparrow race without having to actually race. Clan Night can be completed whether people die during the raid or not.
---
Horror Story(festival of the lost weapon) doesn't have a level requirement if you happen to have it, so you could transfer that. Sorrow MG2 is a submachine gun that used to be the same although I think they changed it to level 20 now but that'll bring your level up a bit and make leveling easier altogether.
---
What song is playing in the video? The singer sounds familiar. 
---
Some go up to 7 lol
---
Bounties bounties bounties. Do them all on every planet and everywhere they're offered. If your time zone is right you can even do them twice a day before and after the reset. I took a 2nd from 30 to 50 playing yesterday and a bit again today. 
---
oof
---
Probably still the best smg there is lol 
---
It was a Trinity Ghoul
---
Jade rabbit is already good tho but I welcome more buffs

This is entirely wrong, because ALL shotguns take no skill, with the exception of slug shotguns like Chaperone. Doesn‚Äôt matter what archetype of buckshot shotgun it is, whether it be Dust Rock Blues or Badlander, they‚Äôre both brainless ape weapons. Slugs shall reign supreme
---
As someone who uses Shards, I don't want more than one exotic, I feel dirty enough already.
---
I agree this is super fun, but if the entire game had this recharge speed it would make pretty much every gun useless because you could just use a super with barely any cooldown. Although I agree it should be a permanent game mode.
---
Hallowfire heart + grenadier + thermite grenades= Fun
---
How effing cute haha
---
managed to snag the heart off the first one almost got a shiny new gun now. Don't normally play Gambit until I got the quest so I don't know how rare these guys are but it seemed special
---
Ok, thanks
---
At least it doesn't have to be 3 resets in one season, thank the Traveller.
---
I play arcstrider with the raspberry chest. I have chained 6+ grenades, in a row, killing 15-20 mobs at a time

The best you‚Äôll get is an exotic class item which in d1 you could equip with another exotic but they do not seem to be coming back.

i just accidentally jump down while skating and shoulder charge save myself

when did anyone say that they thought it would be a good idea to be able to equip 2 exotic armor pieces

What's good about transversives again? They make you sprint faster and reloads your weapons right?

Takes more skill than. Telesto. Wavesplitter. Jotunn.

You can try and look for YouTube videos. I know that Datto does stats a lot of the time but I'm not sure if he's done one for mods... 
---
Yeah I got one too
---
I think it's ugly AF and sharded it

I laughed way to hard at this. Did anyone else?
---
There are OHKO melees everywhere and its fucking autistic. Yes. Wallhack abilities, stupid op supers, broken weapons, one eyed mask, super energy giving exotics, shitty exotics, shitty matchmaking, light advantages are still a thing, ace of spades or you lose, and dont fucking mention machine guns.

If you‚Äôre in a 4 stack that are all good with throwing the game to allow the other team to defeat the meatball, fine. Otherwise it‚Äôs like any other game, play to win. I don‚Äôt have the ship from it yet, so I don‚Äôt want my teammates throwing. Even if I did I‚Äôm going to try to win and not assume my team are all good with throwing.

Shit that's a lot of mods

Thank you

This week's ascendant challenge was rough...so many phalanxes and you only have a made to defend yourself while grabbing the arc charge. Took me 5 tried to finally get it done...
---
I think he means how the matchmaking is completely fucked
---
Oh shit I didn‚Äôt even realize I could have been using that.
---
Well then they should add it because it just gets super boring getting bodied by 6 stacks all with Not Forgotten
---
From level 1-50? I find that hard to believe.
---
they could tone down the force with which they bump you away? That would be an easy fix
---
They could also modify their physics-engine in a way that correctly detects when someone should die due to impact instead of having some bugs in it when you hit the wrong angle
---
it sure isn't as easy to do as other fixes but saying it can't be fixed is wrong
---
I've got over 500 so um pretty sure they are stacks of 999

Helping people is the best

I mean behavior entertainment did it with dead by daylight first so should we call it a "behavior change" ;D

Once again ill say this, please oh please ps4 matchmaking sytem seperate the chirren 11 and under into its own que. Just casualy search they profile. Do they have a name with too many numbers? Is fortnite the most played game? Is the credit card registered to a parent? You have the technology!

How long does it take with an AVERAGE group that knows what to do?

When you throw the ball at the forge and it gets stuck for no reason.

its not so hard if your gpa is bad or your stupid

The weekly missions from Petra in Dreaming City are your best bet. Dark Monastry etc.

You should put them on your feet, arms and body. That way, you'd move even faster.

Sagira: Worse. Present.

Ghost: What region are they simulating?

Osiris: Guardian, this is worse then we‚Äôve ever seen. They may have charred Mercury, destroyed lives in time loops, spent eons finding simulations in which they prevail, but now...

im enjoying it also...... crushing teams with my cerberus+1 all day today so i can hit legend (just did 4 mins ago).

haven't really been getting good drops maybe 90% blue.

NOT COLORADO
---
Omg! Please just remove one shot melees... I highly doubt one punch from a warlock or titan would kill a warlock or a titan... And dont get me started on throwing knifes.
---
Is there a trick to the last few? Or is it simply grinding?
---
I did. Im a warlock main. All you could fucking do is bumch them up then do a singular slam
---
Fuck me they need to change that. They should change it so that any fucking kills you get in the well count. Luckily the day that i decided to do it i did one crucible match, and got sunbracers. Lucky me. Then the 'Ace in the Hole' mission was active and i had to grind that forever
---
Iv been at 38/40 for the last three months. Lmao 
---
I got to 650 at some point this season and am back at 500-something. I decided not even to try Competitive during the end of the season, seems like everyone is trying to make the "final push" to whatever pinnacle weapon they desire. It's probably better to get that out of the way at the start of next season. 
---
I can't change your mind. But 40 consecutive matches for breackneck can. Oooh the things it will do to you
---
Because that strike strat was highly inefficient but very simple. It most certainly is possible to get from 1-50 in under 10 hours.
---
anyone want to do mine.....i have 248 stems and have done 27/40 lol
---
What‚Äôs that is it from a game?

RNJESSUS did his job now it yours to complete

Doesn't the game take care of that on its own? Ive been dc'd from a few matches and not been able to play for 30 or so minutes

Let's just say he's a very good player in the crucible that's very good with decision making and have great game sense. Even the best players get taken out by shotguns.

That's good to know. I'm not sure what is the threshold is for that to trigger.

Catalysts drop from the Prestige version of the Leviathan raid lairs. There are three Catalysts you can get (one per raid) :
---
Legend of Acrius Catalyst : Leviathan Prestige
---
Telesto Catalyst : Eater of Worlds Prestige
---
Sleeper Simulant Catalyst : Spire of Stars Prestige
---
They can drop from any chest or encounter in the raid. Based on RNG.
---
If you have 3 characters with high enough light, you have 15 chances per week, per raid. 
---
Sad but true

The Infinite Paths pulse rifle was my favourite year 1 weapon. It had dragonfly too.

I used to get frustrated about it, but really they're great enemies. These guys and the chaingun wielding cabal really make you take a step back and sort your shit out instead of blindly charging at them.

No lie, I spent like, 3 days farming for Braytech Osprey until I realized ‚Äúoh. I‚Äôm an idiot, it drops from the NF. well then...‚Äù

I'm not sure how to feel after reading these kinds of posts, do I feel happy for the OP or do I feel depressed for myself? 
---
Nah, I don‚Äôt play crucible.

Not really
---
Whaaaat? Slug shotguns are super consistent especially chaperone. Aim for the head and you can map people with it.
---
Nessus definitely has a lot of holes you can get out through, but I'd say you're right. And the OOB stuff on titan is more interesting too - the thing swimming at the bottom of the arcology freaks me out üòÖ

you know when you don't know you need something until you see it...  THIS AIN'T IT CHIEF!!  LOL good job man..

Yea, from what I read there is a glitch with getting the BA Key mold from Ada on a second character, and Bungie is working on it. I'm in the same boat, unlocked the first 3 locks, but she won't give me the mold.
---
So what were you complaining about
---
Shards aren‚Äôt a resource. It‚Äôs considered currency which cannot be moved from your character. 
---
So this is what the architects were architecting 
---
Crucible Metallic / New Age BA / Precursor Vex Chrome / Melchizedek Bramble  
---
And Calus's Selected if I can finally get a group for Levi
---
Mezeldeck Bramble (or however it's spelled)
---
Is it only the big bounty that drops exotics or can all of the bounties with legendary rewards drop exotics?
---
It does work really well. My Antiope is a Year one, so it only has one perk. You may do well to try and get an Antiope from Banshee with kill clip and something else!
---
I really want that hand cannon but I have no friends :/

I know, I didn't mean specifically shards. I think you get my point that people might exploit the system in order to make dollars off of providing resources to players at a cost of real $.

Good bot!
---
Dude, you won't get better if you don't do it. Any clan worth it's salt would walk you through it. With how over leveled everyone is at this point you wouldn't drag them down. The only fights were all 6 people NEED to be doing something are also the easiest mechanics.

The fact that it is unbalanced in favor of the invader. Unlike something like Dark Souls, where being hidden is an advantage required to keep from getting ganked, this just seems petty. And often, as I solo queue in Gambit, I have a team that can‚Äôt coordinate to take out the invader and I can‚Äôt beat them in a 1v1 with their advantages. So what I‚Äôm saying isn‚Äôt that linear fusion rifles should just be outright banned but rather there needs to be a system to reveal the invader if he gets a kill or something.
---
I want it because it's one of three exotics I'm missing across all characters. I have three titles already but I doubt I will ever get Rivensbane because unfortunately I play with the kind of people that couldn't beat anything without dying, let alone an entire raid.
---
Sorry, should have clarified.
---
I also play on PC.
---
But Chaperone just has insane aim assist, don't you think? You can just flick to the general area around the head and you'll most likely get the HS, kinda like QB
---
OT but I very much don't like his face.
---
Like, to the point where it prevents him from being funny to me.
---
Anyway, here's Cabal on the field.
---
Grind prime engrams as they will give people below 600 LL larger boosts than before. Also do all milestones.
---
You‚Äôre correct. There will always be someone willing to pay for resources and in that, you‚Äôll male a market to sell them. Consider 2 things:
---
1. They‚Äôre planetary resources. Anyone can collect them at any time. If someone *really* wanted to buy them, what are they gaining exactly?
---
2. Folk are paying for carries and account recoveries right now and there‚Äôs nothing Bungie can do about it.
---
If someone really wants to spend their time just playing Destiny2 so they feed a resource bank to then sell back to people, let them go for it. 
---
You probably don't have enough stems.
---
Depends on how much you play and how you use your time. Pretty much the only tip is to do anything that rewards "Powerful Gear" as those will drop above your current LL. I always start with the Dreaming City weeklies, then the Vanguard or Flashpoint, then whatever else I feel like.
---
You should level up pretty quickly though! Best of luck to you Guardian!
---
Blueshift Dreams for me.
---
You can put %appdata% in the address bar and browse from there.
---
Oh shit. did you just delete them instead of opening them? I never even thought of that. 
---
Also D2 Checklist keeps track of all that shit for you, it shows all of the triumphs, what is involved, and for ones that are percentages it shows you what the actual number is. 
---
Sim seeds for 1 legendary shard at spider.  Turn in to Brother, breakdown shaders as well as items.  Get 80% of your shards back + mod components + enhancement cores + weapon components + y1 exotic drops every 100 or so turn ins.
---
Go with an empty inventory.
---
"You fight dirty, I like that"
---
Why would you not decode exotic engrams?
---
Absolutley love this gun.  Been messing around with it and alot of my other trials weapons here lately.  I'm fine with the roll on Darkest Before just let me put a mod on it Bungo!
---
Bungie.net or the companion app. 
---
I would generally recommend everyone get the companion app. 
---
Bungie posts a weekly This Week at Bungie article that contains all of Bungie‚Äôs official communication on upcoming updates, events and known issues as well as some additional things occasionally and their patch notes. The app also provides an item management system for transferring gear between characters, their official LFG and some other features. 
---
what about the gambit player who forgets it's gambit and not crucible? and then blames you when they don't get a portal in the first 15 seconds
---
I realize it's easy, I'm not one that would pay for it. The difference between the carry services and this would only be the fact that to carry you actually need to play, but you could farm resources fairly easily with bots. Really it might not be a huge difference.
---
I don't care if people pay real money for in game resources, I just would hope to not encounter bots every matchmade game I play, that was my only point.
---
0 melee dmg 0 gun damage only ability dmg ... knife / nade / super 
---
i was going to ask the same
---
holy shit I'm the exact same, you got a playstation?
---
I already had all exotic back then so I was just grinding for weapons 
---
That‚Äôs pretty harsh. I‚Äôve been in a similar situation in last seasons iron banner where I was immortal and invisible to the opposing team. I couldn‚Äôt hurt them either, but it let me cap zones still, and it took me forever to replicate it 
---
That's me with Clouds at Sea, I fucking love that shader
---
Great now I want to fuck a vex and I thought it was bad enough I wanted to fuck a assualtron. Damn you Reddit look what you are doing to me 
---
Sunrise warrior for me
---
They point of the invader is that he is outnumvered and against 4 other guardians fully capable of beating him as well. Yes he has wallhacks and a overshield but a full auto shotty will melt him as well as team shotting him. The reason why they haven‚Äôt addressed it is probably because its not that broken. 
---
The only thing I would recommend changing is the ram due to ryzen liking faster ram. Around 3000mhz.
---
\&gt;when you speak to him about the darkness
---
I got four thousand voices but no bow
---
That reference though. That's really old.
---
Mine is new age black armory 
---
Gift of the Nine here
---
Call me an unwrapped present because I have no bow
---
 At 13m if its the same gun with same scope, but different ranges, the one with more range will have a bigger hitbox. Past 13 the lower ranged weapons hitbox will start to shrink while the other gets bigger. This is what I know for certain, so in theory yes. I will have to test it to be certain though.
---
YOU DISCUSTING HUMAN
---
this shader is like the father mask of destiny 2
---
But then somehow the second before impact your team either kills them all or they ninja vanish across the map
---
I works the same on both. No difference there.
---
I'm just assuming because it's comp and that's all you see Nightstalkers run in there.  SB's is still good even without Gwisn but yea, you're right.  There's no symbol for SB.  Just the the Blade Barrages symbol looks like a Golden Gun.
---
24 should be more than enough hopefully 
---
Finna shoot my *golden gun*
---
How did you get the sparrow before the sword?
---
Exactly üòÇüòÇ. Definitely need a max range SA.
---

---
PLUUUUUS
---
ULTRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!
---
No, I don't know why. Elaborate
---
*Has Luna's and one eyed mask* 
---
*Questions how you are bad with a load out like that*
---
It'll be nice to see Spectral nerfed. Like, I use Nova Warp and love getting all the multi-kills, but it's pretty obvious how overtuned it is, and Spectral feels even worse. I counted the seconds an enemy had Spectral up in my last Crucible match, and it was a good 30-45 seconds of murder.
---
I only play lock, so I can't say I know whether or not it can be extended by exotics, but getting killed and then spawnkilled twice by the same guy in his super doesn't make pvp feel right.
---
So... where's the juicebox at?
---
The Psion Flayer cloaks! Those NEED to make a comeback! 
---
Customization where we can alter the glow in all different colors (not just arc, solar &amp; Void) to match our character would be pretty sweet too. 
---
Precursor Vex Chrome. Calus‚Äô Selected. Mercury Prophetic. Mad Monk. Genotype Null Zero. (But maybe because I have tons of those from EP completions) 
---
Explains using combat sights on Queensbreaker
---
"Dude why didn't you just let us wipe?!"
---
"Did you see the part where I punched that guy in the balls?"
---
Facts
---
It lasted that long because of the gwisin  vest. Super lasts 20 sec  with nothing and while invis lasts 25. Gwisin  adds to it. The additional damage reduction and extended duration while invis will be nerfed. Nova is going to take a hit, you should read the changes
---
No but he could travel back in time to prevent it.
---
As with many things in the game, some of the basic mechanics aren't explained/explained well.
---
I bought 40 nebula shaders when tess had them recently
---
one quick question- Why didn't the Vex destroy Failsafe when they converted Nesssus?
---
People complained that they didn‚Äôt feel powerful that why stuff is powerful. Anybody can do it if you put in the time to get the stuff thats strong. 
---
Targeting Adjuster is what you need. Counterbalance Stock is broken currently and makes your recoil worse instead
---
I agree, but I am sort of frustrated that melee and swords do *nothing* against them. It'd be nice if if at least did damage to the shield's center like you can do with ranged attacks. As it stands, they are absolute hell for a melee-focused Titan build or for add-clearing swords.
---
I think for most maps twilight oath is going to be best. For those suuuuper long range maps yeah I would say bite of the fox. Now you got me thinking... I'll have to test that.
---
Borderlands has weapon parts. Frames, barrels, mags, stocks etc, that roll randomly for each gun. It only seems like a lot because of the combinations, but many of them are the same gun with a diff skin on it. D2 is same deal, they just handle it with weapon perk combos instead of gun parts 
---
I hate to be a pessimist since I love this game despite its many flaws, but I can‚Äôt see any of these becoming a reality. 
---
You presented some good ideas though, so let‚Äôs hope I‚Äôm wrong. 
---
I read them. It'll probably be good overall, though I think Titans are getting indirectly get buffed due to them, and in tandem getting an unnecessary direct buff with their shield super being stronger. With shotgun OEM and shoulder charge already being frustrating at 80% of the pvp levels, I think we're in for another rough patch.
---
How so? Especially since if OP buys Forsaken they get the boost they need to get into forsaken content
---
It is worth it. But depending on how much you play you will get content that lasts from a week up to around 2 months. Forsaken will give you another 2 months of content. But once you are done with forsaken the game is done. The season pass as well as the free seasonal content is not worth it. 
---
I'm just annoyed there's no changes to shotguns or one eyed mask or titan skating 
---
Nope :/ I didn't even know that was a thing I just play pve. All I wanted was the malfeasance tho so I'm happy.
---
he got the sword before the sparrow, each new item starts on the right and pushes everything to the left
---
I just think it would suck even with the boost
---
***sigh*** "That's right, Caboose. I'm a gay robot."
---
I actually love seeing snipers on my team. A shotgun just doesn‚Äôt apply pressure the way a sniper does. You can‚Äôt just ape a sniper, anyone with half a brain can dome one target moving in a straight line. So you use your primary. And forcing people to use a primary is something that only a sniper can do. Of course, tryhards with a full auto+full choke+slideshot Dust Rock and a Not Forgotten is welcome on my team too lol.
---
I got Hard Light from him... looks nice!
---
I‚Äôm in the same exact spot. Warlock is at 643. A helmet and chest piece is holding me back big time. All 4 clan engrams gave me weapons too. Gotta love that RNG! 
---
30th ascendant clear. Only third on this character though and hadn‚Äôt played this char since black armory. I got my main up to 650 and started this ones trek yesterday. 
---
Ascendant challenge. From the chest. 
---
The fakest. 
---
Skullfort and Code of the Missile
---
No idea. 
---
I am a short-mid titan so I feel your pain. Getting the right angle for a shotgun can be a pain in the ass and it seems like they're ALWAYS facing the wrong direction for me to get a clean shot. I usually save my grenades just for these guys so I can get them staggered, then run up and finish the job.
---
You got this, I believe in you and the rng Gods will bless you this week :)
---
Nice video! Really liked the music also! 
---
Whats your player ID so I can see how good you actually are because that will tell me alot about why you‚Äôre complaining so much.
---
Tarnished Copper
---
That contradicts yourself tho
---
New age black armory as well. White and golden and black and red are my 2 fav color schemes
---
Helmet, chest piece, bond. That's it
---
So that was what cayde was talking about. "Vex trap"
---
Orly? Huh. My friend was the runner last time and he didn‚Äôt get it but I did. 
---
Is the threat level hard to get?
---
I've been dealing with that pain for weeks I swear if I open another prime and get a Zenobia-D I'm gonna lose my mind üòÇ
---
Beastly gun, use to use it a lot, I should pull one out and mess with it. Was actually messing with Relentless recently, definitely an underated pulse too. Now we just need some mod spots added on
---
Tough choices, there's bits and pieces all over the place that are great. The old Iron Lords are dope, a bunch of the Hive lore is great too, with throne worlds and sword logic and all that, my favorite is still probably everything surrounding the Vanguard dare, like you get the jist of it from grimoire and triumph entries as well as the events of Forsaken, but still no solid idea of what it actually is, and that's fascinating.
---
He did last time I checked. My favorite is New in Town it's fantastic!
---

I have one in my list but havent got around to actually watching it
---
Whatever makes you feel better!
---
Does he keep the helmet on?
---
That happened to me once, but I was way closer to making it which made it even worse.
---
Well if you ever have time, watch New in Town. 
---
I disagree,  and I'm a mediocre sniper. But seriously fuck shotguns
---
There is that. I mean I get it if people don't understand envoys or even some basic strategy like.
---
 But, everyone should know that there are motes, there is a bank, the motes go in the bank and it is a very bad thing to die with a lot of motes. 
---
I also assume that the drifter doesn't just tell me that we have enough enough motes for the primeval and we need to bank them.... But it sure does seem like he only says that to me sometimes... Often times actually!
---
Am surprise no-one has lewded the traveler yet...
---
üòÇüòÇ because im constantly changing the armour ive barely used the shaders üò¨
---
Wow, I didn‚Äôt even realize I was getting downvoted but thank you! A little positivity goes a long way :) Have a good day/night, Guardian.
---
Because strongest plot armor in the destiny universe, unless the first game has a better cause plot armor scenario 
---
No sure exactly but the 5 valor resets are retroactive for the broad sword quest so I imagine it should count for the Luna‚Äôs like that as well 
---
Mmm, vex...milk.
---
It‚Äôs a pretty simple spot to get to so you can get there and have your own guardian watching over the city. Which can add some nice personalization to it!
---
It‚Äôs called Obsidian Radiance. There‚Äôs a fairly common drop from bergusia forge called an Obsidian Accelerator. Turning this into Ada-1 gives you an Obsidian Radiance, which can be applied to any forge or scourge of the past weapon. It makes the weapon deal 5% more damage in forges and adds the glowing effect you can see on the side of the barrel.
---
Or you could just /t
---
check check, check this out and lemme know how this feels: Taken Cayde 6 strike. Oh yeahhhhhh
---
Because we wouldn‚Äôt have forsaken if that happened ü§î
---
As others have said, 50-90 minutes for a group that knows mechanics, ~4 hours for a sherpaed run with players that can understand mechanics, ~6 for sherpaed runs with idiots, and 8+ for blind runs.
---
Always you say... Have you heard about the last word?
---
That‚Äôs nice. I got j√∂tunn and Le Monarque this week.
---
I can‚Äôt be the only guy that absolutely loves the rust effect from Descendant Vex Chrome, right? It fits so well on the tangled shore gear
---
Very nice!
---
Precursor Vex Chrome for me.
---
Iron season 1 shader 
---
Me
---
literally everything I own (even the irl ghost)
---
YES. Or Satou Tribe

I mean at least they gave us the forge anyways, doubt they'll ever try that again though
---
That‚Äôs not how you spell Molten Bronze, it‚Äôs sooooo good. 
---
Rng
---
Wasn‚Äôt there. Both random drops with low low chance
---
645 for pvp the other for pvm
---
You get full armor. You can even tank a golden gun shot/sleeper
---
As far as I‚Äôve heard, they‚Äôre right. Nightshade can have higher-zoom sights, and as such, will have longer range. Try an iron sight maybe? One that doesn‚Äôt have a loop or scope or anything, just the hologram.
---
Console pleb here. I think that with the popularity and performance of Luna's and NF it *has* created a divide in PvP, but I think the proper way to address this is by bringing other guns up to par.
---
They could fix recoil animations and bloom on console for 140s/150s.
---
They're already slated to buff autos and scouts.
---
I think the biggest problem is the only ttk that can challenge the pinnacle 180s is AoS, but on console it's not good enough to do so in PvP
---
Delete
---
Damn. I really want the Sunshot catayst too :((
---
change random hunter to random warlock using nova warp
---
Thats yo boi!
---
Clearly you've never used shards of Galanor, it's ridiculously inconsistent
---
Ok first you were complaining that HMG were black armoury only, now you're mad they're rare drops? Seriously just get good, any linear fusion rifle will do the trick, a sniper rifle and malfeasance do just as well.

Aaah the new monarchy exotic cloak! I see you too are a man of culture

The phrase is used colloquially in the southern United States (likely elsewhere) with phrases such as "hell yes," "damn right," "fuck yeah."
---
Unless that hunter is an idiot like me and pops it on a sentinel titan who just popped his own super. 
---
Just ‚Äúget good‚Äù. Lol. Just as bad as the Dark Souls community. No useful feedback or concerns for the balancing of PvP just ‚Äúdeal with it‚Äù.
---
If on console you want stability over range, but on PC Handling/Range seems what they prefer.

Use Accurized rounds

There‚Äôs ‚Äúxx‚Äù on each side of the name, they must be a crucible god
---
What is this app you speak of? The companion app? I'm sitting on over 8k of those things.
---
Yup, Ive been playing this game since D1 beta. But from what I've seen, no one has mentioned how the Hitbox is bigger due to purely accuracy alone. That's why i tested this on bows. There's no increase to zoom, or range, just accuracy. This directly affects the hitbox size. Ive checked old posts from a couple years back before i posted this and people said that accuracy just decreases the firing cone. People have also mentioned zoom before, that i said mainly for the newer players. The distance I kinda new about, but its nice to see in person. Basically i tried to explain what i found that i have not heard of yet. Its very hard to do, but i could explain it in person because I can draw pictures and do more then just use words.
---
Yeah the companion app shows what every vendor has in stock except xur
---
I believe!
---
No. I said stop blaming the guns actually, plenty of other options out there. Stop crying jesus.
---
Also get good
---
TWAB made it seem like quite a few things are getting fixed on the 29th
---
Lol... It was. 
---
New monarchy regalia all day 
---
Definitely worth playing, I started in November after I got it for free and have sunk nearly 300 hours into it. I don‚Äôt even usually care for shooters but the shooting just feels so *right*. The DLCs are worth picking up as well. 
---
If someone quits out once it started, points should be lost. But if Bungie cannot make a match of 4v4, players shouldn‚Äôt suffer due to their lack of dev skill.
---
Who knew Granny was such a badass
---
No unfortunately 
---
That Bumble Bee or Gambit Chrome. Is amazing 
---
Awesome
---
League also doesn't reward the winning team points in that game. Or at least DotA doesn't with the same system. They call the game safe to leave, no points recorded. 
---
Probably was a great player to get a 31 kd, but 1 game is a super, super small sample size. There is a reason kd is cumulative. 
---
Totally worth it. Unless I actually need another exotic, I never put this thing away. 
---
Doing it right. 
---
&gt; I know I can get another down the line I just don't want to hate the first one I get.
---
If the losing team doesn't lose points would the winning team not win points?
---
Stupid sexy Riven..

Hahaha I almost selected that too. I just like the name of Future War Cult and the colors a little bit more. Used to be full dead orbit. Too bad factions are basically pointless now. What's your PSN? Mine is NinjaaaaMoooouse (4 a's and 4 o's)

---
Trust with Calus' is the only way to roll. 
---
If you have the base game, the only things you need are Forsaken (which includes the first two DLC Warmind and Curse of Osiris) and then the Annual Pass.
---
I'd suggest waiting on purchasing the Annual Pass until you complete Forsaken and get up to around 600LL. You can get a bundle that has Forsaken+Annual Pass, but I think you only save like $5.
---
&gt; really easy and you get to essentially troll people

---
Arc + insurmountable skullfort = big fun times! 
---
Solar probably easier to use and better overall super damage. Also fun. 
---
The two prestige hand cannons are not a huge deal IMO. I get killed by them just about as much as anything else.
---
Crucible is in a bad place because there is too much heavy ammo and 6v6 is a super-fest. Quickplay feels like half-strength Mayhem which is not an ideal FPS to me.
---
Ahh I had no idea. Well that sucks.
---
So what you're saying is that it's balanced? A well designed shotgun in a video game was never meant to be entirely fair, and that's the point.
---
Ohh, but what if I have it active? 
---
M I L K
---
If you enjoy the game, yes it‚Äôs worth it. Sure black armory might of not been the greatest, but there‚Äôs still like 3 more dlcs coming in the next 6-8 months. The next releases will be better than black armory.

No problem buddy,  I'm actually surprised the mod hasn't gotten you yet. Hes a bit of a stickler

Dawnblade fully charged

you need a fireteam of min 2 players, both need to have the quest active or one needs the quest the other person needs the rat king equipped

Use the "crutch" weapons and then everyone is on a level playing field. Problem solved.
---
Tangled bronze on forge armor makes it look sooo rusty and freshly dug up. its amazing. i want to change the shaders to cool stuff as i masterwork them.
---
Oh yes I'm well aware haha I didn't mean like total over all but his crucible tag said 4.6 I think so hes definately good if I remember correctly. He still absolutely demolished my ass though.
---
Spectral blades technically still nightsalkers 
---
I hate when I have the mini heart attack as I check the feed to see whether or not if it says I've casted my super
---
Everything you said is plain wrong.
---
Scouts have insane potential range, but low damage output - it's not a weapon you mindlessly rush in with toward the combat, but instead you use range as advantage over handcannon and pulse rifle users who can barely scratch you from far distance.
---
Scout rifles require different approach to tactics and positioning compared to other guns, but could be really devastating in right hands - just stop rushing towards point and take advantageous position over your short-ranged opponents - kills would flow.
---
I love my current loadout with jade rabbit and knucklehead radar, and it does not hinder my abilities in crucible at all
---
It can actually screw you in Crucible. I‚Äôve had it happen on a few occasions with my Blast Furnace and Luna‚Äôs since they both have dropped mag. It can quickly end a really nice kill streak. 
---
It‚Äôs totally worth using, but once you‚Äôve gotten 10 or so kills you need to start looking for ammo drops and strangely primary doesn‚Äôt drop all over the place like you would expect. 
---
Nothing more frustrating than losing a 1v1 because you ran out of ammo. 
---
Which adventure?
---
A surprise to be sure, but an unwelcome one. 
---
Yeah I tried rumble but nothing but 1&amp;2 shotgun sliders owning the map. I haven't given up, just slowly trying while doing weekly's.
---
Try different load outs. Try different strategies. Stick with someone don't go solo thinking you can take on multiple people. Watch some youtube videos and see what people are doing different. 
---
Doubtful 
---
"Forging" the weapons requires finishing both phases AND defeating the Forge Warden (or boss).
---
It doesn't matter how you view it, that's how the game is. You can't just go into the forge and run out the timer. You have to actually defeat the boss for it to drop the 'forged' weapon. 
---
And at 566, you're going to have a really hard time in phase 2 and against the boss. 
---
That's what I'm thinking too. It'll probably be fun to use, but I doubt it'll outshine them. 
---
At close range it will be able to, mid range it won‚Äôt be able to.
---
Refer people like that to [this](https://imgur.com/gallery/HnRVFkc).
---
I did not create it.
---
I haven't seen it with blade barrage but I've seen a spectral blade last long enough for him to kill me three times in one cast because of that Gwesin Vest.
---
You can get the same roll as the currated on from any encounter, but it won't drop masterworked unless you get it from the first encounter.

But that was also my opinion it doesn't fit with the way I play as a warlock

Toss the crucible shader on it, and you have your very own Optimus Prime rig!
---
There should be a code for an emblem on there I think.
---
Ran into a guy with this exact load out (just switch Wardcliff for Thunderbird),
---
Kept spamming power ammo 
---
More stuff like the whisper mission should be added for secret exotics 
---
That‚Äôs in one round, not 3.
---
Popping the new arcstaff instantly reflects blade barrage. It's fantastic.

The Rider I think. The one that takes you into the Boil.

So I was waiting for Mars FP to see if I could get the Nascent Dawn quest done (need Psyonic potential Heroic) but still there are no Heroic Adventures on Mars for me, even though I've finished all normal adventures multiple times. I thought the FP would make them appear but no dice. What am I missing?

I got d2 pc when it was free, more just to have it. I have 5 close friends who play it and pestered me to play, so I started two weeks ago, currently @ 646 light level on my Titan with full masterwork gear and most of the exotics I want to use to play around with different builds. having a great time playing, and we are all going to start raiding this reset once one of our teammates gets back from her holiday. wish I had of started playing sooner, but 2 weeks to catch up is cheese compared to say WOW, which is what I dropped to play d2.

And the AR buff is coming out man! I want to keep it so bad....best roll I‚Äôll ever get on this weapon. The shader is so sexy though lol
---
My friend only needs the sparrow for rivensbane, and he‚Äôs completed over 80 runs lol
---
He probably thinks they're random because a lot of events are almost always heroic when there's enough people around while some public events are much harder to turn heroic if running around by one's self.
---
Also, there aren't that many events and the mechanics for making them heroics are the same for each unique event (by that I mean every Summoning Ritual uses the same means for heroic on Titan as it does on Mars). If the mechanics varied, I could see maintaining the information would be more difficult, but it's not bad as they are now.

Goes to collections... 
---
I still message kinderguardians when they fuck up Heroics...
---
Nothing toxic, just simply:
---
"Learn how to properly do public events as to not ruin them for everyone else." Or something along that lines.

I love a good bow duel when I play PvP

Super toaster is OP

Or just shoulder-charging the guy before he can get a shot off then walk away. He isn't even worth the T-Bag.
---
And he gave us so much shit for going after Uldren. 
---
No wonder...he knew we would pursue him just as doggedly. 
---
Yeah idk wtf is so funny lol. Sorry not everyone has had this game as long as you, neither/nor could put in the same amount of time to get to 650. Shit, this is the third week I‚Äôve had the game, and I‚Äôve been a no-life since and I‚Äôm still only at 610 on my main character...

Some of the armor have randomized perks, but I have no plan to use them still. So It‚Äôs best if I dismantle them? 
---
The commitment brother

Meta will be meta, shit changes and everyone jumps on the new bandwagon. Prom lens week, antipode-d, graviton, telesto and wavesplitter will be waning away in popularity soon. It is what is.

I just think it is always more fun to challenge yourself using different weapons and load outs even if you don‚Äôt get the stats you normally would, who cares. If I hit half of the snipes vs kills I would get using a shotgun, I‚Äôm happy and find it a lot more enjoyable. They don‚Äôt need to nerf these, PvP community just needs to step it up to challenge themselves with other loadouts. If you‚Äôre good enough to get Not Forgotten come mess with it quickplay some but then try other stuff. You really need to pub stomp all us shittier players over and over? That‚Äôs why I love cammycakes vids he plays with meta some but he‚Äôs always trying out different non-meta loadouts and setups

Bungie got 100 Million from NetEase, so Destiny 3, or whatever their next project is going to be, will be a hard pass. 
---
Its probably the return of ghaul and his red legion or better yet, The Darkness...
---
You do realize you can change your aim as you're shooting right? Or are you saying literally every enemy super I have shut down despite how badly they were destroying me before, were incompetents? 
---
But look at my cool exotic bro it cool and exotic
---
i got it on one of my first tries of EP hahaha
---
I am amazed at how shitty the green/white armor looks. Have not seen it in a very very long time
---
basically kill wizards, clear adds wait for the hyper invade, clear invade dps before second wave spawn and invade.
---
Banner shield be like

How do I get new Forsaken exotic armor to drop?, I keep getting repeats of what I already have, I've been grinding with all characters, got just about everything for my warlock and Titan, but last two exotics that I need just won't drop,  is it a bug? or am I doing something wrong.

gatchaman strikes again I see

This made me chuckle. Someone needs a tractor cannon to the face

Pc players have more invested in their rigs and in general are less casual than console gamers. Not to say that there aren't great console players out there too :)
