I would quite happily strangle a OEM titan and pierce through its eyes so hard like outta that GoT scene and then throw it in the incinerator and burn to hell for all I care. OEM's full of cancer ughh.

---
People crying in PVP about recluse making Bungie make it take a dip in PVE. Probably one of the most versatile weapons in that environment. Didn‚Äôt break encounters, didn‚Äôt trivialize them, and allowed you to have options elsewhere. Will wait to see the end result, I suspect it will feel the same as using something like subjunctive or calus mini tool that has a damage perk. Which works just fine. 
---

---
Still a little annoying though that clowns who can‚Äôt figure out how not to get destroyed by an SMG in crucible are making it take a hit everywhere.
---
Been solo since new light, will continue to solo. Ive only ever queued up with the fireteam finder for end game encounters. Will continue to solo.
---
No, only the Ballistic Log frames count. 
---
I have the same complaint as you. It's silly that you can only do two per week and that if you have one in progress during reset that it's eaten and the now useless Log is refunded. Just let me finish it, for pity's sake.
---
I've got to agree with the other dude. Maybe it depends on what region you're playing in? I don't know how they work it. But there's a fairly big problem with cheaters, this is based of my own experiences in the crucible. I stopped playing it not so long, I'd got to the point where it was pissing me off really bad.
---
How can I get thunderlord?Is it only possible by Xur now? Or are there other ways?
---
Last word and bray tech scout fucking best combo
---
I got the sniper running the Ordeal 750 an not even breaking 50K on pyramidion. Was first run as well. So yeah the drip rates are still there. An no never did it over 100K before. 
---
So the chances I would say are about the same. It's all RNG.
---
I just click the little pencil (I‚Äôm using mobile) and use the video camera to post this last one. :(
---
I hope that helps! Let me know how it goes.
---
Don't kill me but Warframe does MTX way better than Destiny does.
---
At least we have mountaintop... for now
---
At long last, the king has fallen. His crown shattered, and blade dulled. The recluse and OEM are no more. 
---
It‚Äôs about time.
---
Agreed OEM has had it coming, but for real Recluse did too IMO. Have you seen the usage stats on it? It's over 1/3 of all total kills in PVE and almost 50% of all Raid kills  [https://destinytracker.com/destiny-2/db/insights](https://destinytracker.com/destiny-2/db/insights)
---
I feel that comrade. It's a tough time for us loners.
---
This sounds like a lore entry from the way it's written, and I can just imagine my name is byf reading that.
---
I wouldn't say the weapon is bad, xenophage is a really solid weapon the only issue is that it doesint compete well against other exotic power weapons, honestly if they just buff the ammo reserves it will make xenophage a top tier weapon and there is also a catalyst for the weapon as well so depending on what the catalyst does it could make xenophage god tier.
---
It's been almost 7 months.
---
You could call it a clan!
---
Thank the lord its getting a nerf. Tired of getting looked at and losing half my half and damage.
---
i  love this idea
---
Pretty sure many would gladly fuck Ana Brey in your stead.
---
Yea but the problem with gambit prime when farming for spare rations is that gambit prime has a waaaaay larger lootpool than compared to t2 reckoning or t3 meaning you have less of a chance getting spare rations and more of a less of a chance of getting the roll you want running gambit prime compared to reckoning.
---
All the curated Forge weapons come with the shader as far as I can remember myself, so a good idea if you want to specifically get the shader you can try for the curated Blast Furnace since its curated roll isn't really that great anyways
---
As someone who loves playing solo, I'm just glad Warframe is *incredibly* solo-friendly. I wish Destiny was too but oh well. Not having an in-game LFG hurts too.
---
Just let me solo Strikes and all Nightfalls, Bungie. Let me take my time with missions instead of competing for kills with my teammates. Sigh.
---
im playing in eu but i have the feeling reporting them doesnt help at all maby they should implement a system how they have it in league of legends for years that you get an instant feedback report when a player is getting punished just to have the feeling they are doing something about it
---
Do you save the capture from the Xbox app and pull it from there?
---
This is one of the more puzzling aspects of this game. I‚Äôve got some sweet armor that I have to wear because the stats are way better, but I‚Äôd prefer to you know, have my IB armor look and feel.
---
You guys all talking about the knife and I‚Äôm over here wondering how you are playing comp with graviton lance
---
This is the best post I‚Äôve seen today. üòÇ
---
I literally just LOL"d  too funy. Bless them.
---
What is "normal comp" and "solo game mode" exactly?
---
Lol
---
Idk why people say this anymore. Just use the app
---
Ah yes the original guardian killer
---
Uldren is already dead. We already killed him.
---
His body is resurrected as a guardian without memories. 
---
Stop these senseless killing intentions.
---
You don't need friends to do raids or play destiny. This is a common misconception. Just go on bungie.net or find an LFG app and find randoms. It can be a little challenging or it can be fun and easy. It's awesome to meet new people and learn how to beat the encounters together. Eventually I shit you not after running say Val ca our on spire of stars you and the other guy know who's going up without saying a word to each other because you learned it that much.
---
All I wanna do is get exotics and do raids
---
I think you can‚Äôt get it anymore, but I‚Äôm not sure.
---
I said need but I meant want
---
Maybe you shouldn't play gambit if you know you have a shitty connection?
---
I known how you feel it took a little over 2 years for me to get a Halfdan-D.
---
Still waiting on a Mannanan Sr4 though :(
---
I got it üëç I tried doing video before instead of gif. Thanks üòä
---
You will earn them by playing games and turning in tokens. Takes a while but if you play 3 games a night should have it quick.
---
That‚Äôs good though? We want more exotic variation
---
No i do not have the dlc
---
Fun fact, I did this
---
It‚Äôs glory, I‚Äôm at 2104 rank points. Just barely made it into fabled.
---
All I'm going to say now is, don't be a dick on posts like this because odds are someone hasn't seen it. I hope that you have a good night and that the upcoming holidays bring you a full stomach and a happy heart.
---
If you‚Äôre that good just LFG with a decent team lmao
---
Then you can't get it
---
Shoulder charge good, friend need to know
---
Here are pics
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/tzBGHoc
---
Definitely disagree w a fire team being required. You don‚Äôt have to sweat for the majority of pinnacle weapons (which I assume is why most solos play pvp). You can get to fabled in 6 to 7 games now w a streak solo. 
---
Bungie has never offered a better, more fair solo pvp experience in D2 than the one we have now. No sweat required.
---
Dead meme  
---
  
---
\*rimshot\*
---
Nah, we already have invulnerable frames and overshield. this guy could‚Äôve easily moved out of the way. OP was playing slowly. The guy who killed him had a linear fusion too
---
I understand your frustration. This has been a pattern since D1, even regular legendaries got that treatment aka Hopscotch Pilgrim. Had to grind strikes and hope that RNG gave you a good one. Boom nerf hammer, one of my friends did 100 strikes to get his and they nerfed it to another subclass of pulse rifles.
---
As for now I do grind out some of them, but my heart isn‚Äôt in it any longer for all of them. Only have Luna‚Äôs and Recluse from a PvP perspective.
---
We don't have a proper Thorn.  We turned the proper Thorn into Lumina.  Also it needs a Darkness-infused bullet.
---
It's still going to be strong....you still get health regen and a damage buff. All its losing Is the over shield. People will still complain.
---
F
---
You are very right, but nothing can stop us from knowing people before they become guardians. Would w like devrim less if he became a Guardian?
---
You just know Calus just burst into uncontrollable laughter when that happened.
---
do it i wanna see it lolz
---
I love my recluse, by it needed it. And fyi, "BuNgIe I'm A bUsY pErSoN bLaH bLaH bLaH" doesn't mean they need to cater to you.
---
I have a clan that is exactly for this/them/you/us. 
---
Lone Beasts
---
I trashed a 65 stat chest piece the other day cause I wasn‚Äôt looking.
---
How
---
I don‚Äôt think anybody can be unhappy with these changes. OEM is ridiculously overpowered in PVP and I‚Äôm tired of seeing the Recluse in every meta loadout ever.
---
r/foundtheOEMtitan
---
Seeing "Must kwtd" a few days after new content drops makes me want to vomit. Usually the person hosting doesn't even kwtd and just want a free carry
---
I‚Äôve died many times while still in the revive animation
---
Unfortunately, no.
---
I've officially been banned from driving.
---
We even made a deceleration of no acceleration for me.
---
I'm only allowed to drive under the circumstances that we're a) under attack or b) in desperate need of a getaway.

*Weapons of Light:00:05*
---
Dude, there are so many lfg sites, apps (including the official one), and clans out there you can use or join to help you. If you're not using tools that are available to you it's your fault.
---
Every lil bit helps.
---
Dumb logic. It is f2p in the sense that you can play the game, get to know how it works, and play a significant amount of the content for 0$. Now wether or not someone wants to she'll out the 30$ or so to buy shadowkeep and forsaken is completely their call. The game doesn't force you to spend money in order to play the game, thus being a f2p game. It's a very simple idea. If a game is free to access content, it is a free game.
---
Oh ok thanks, I had the code I was just confused on the price
---
That only works when there's a lot of good choices to choose from.
---
Armor aesthetic has been awful in Destiny 2 for the most part with only a couple of exceptions in each class.
---
Everything should be available for D2 at this point, especially since you can't pull what you want from your archives cuz random rolls
---
Yes legion yes it does (love your title)
---
Good team work
---
I think I see what you mean, take stats you like on armor you don‚Äôt, and overwrite stats you don‚Äôt like on armor you do like, correct?
---
That is actually a fantastic idea. It circumvents issues regarding rare material economy (found a price of gear you like with mediocre stats but it has the right affinity? MW it and find the stats later, and your ascendant shard isn‚Äôt wasted now, but it‚Äôs also still valuable), it makes the indecisive choice between old armor and new armor irrelevant by not making you feel like you‚Äôre wasting mats upgrading armor that isn‚Äôt as good as it could be, and you still have to grind for the armor you want because you need to find the right stats on the piece to be infused. I actually couldn‚Äôt come up with something comparable other than the diablo 3 transmog system just being ported in
---
‚ÄúNerfing Titans will solve all of our problems!‚Äù
---
Meanwhile with mountaintop and recluse
---
Bungie does this so people cant buy rewards like the hive sword replica or braytech werewolf t shirt without completing the challenge to get it. When you do they'll send you a discount code bringing it to normal price
---
Ruined the Drifter for me
---
Aka making raids dumb easy club.
---
So it would have been the day before volundr
---
This where we discover none of us play on the same system
---
Elementary school project? üòÇ
---
Recluse Nerf seems pretty significant to me. Now that bodyshot damage has been realled in I predict we'll see a lot less imbiciles who can't aim using it. It will still be strong ofc but it'll actually require an ounce of skill to use now.
---
Stupid question since I'm away from my console. Can I... retrieve it from my from armor collection? 
---
I did a quick Google and it says the legendary version if the 'Ego Talon IV' sold by Ikora Rey. Which I assume she doesn't sell anymore? Never noticed it when getting Vex bounties.
---
Do the thing, get buy the thing, profit
---
I'm like that, but with Exotic Catalysts... still need to finish the catalysts for Riskrunner, Fighting Lion, Hard Light, Sweet Business, Sturm, Jade Rabbit, Ace of Spaces, Outbreak Perfected, and D.A.R.C.I.
---
...completing bounties and gaining XP is just that thing that just sorta happens while I'm grinding out catalysts.
---
That would be cool! A season of just SRL could be too much like many felt gambit was, but possibly adding in different race modes could help. One idea was a race ‚Äúfight‚Äù where a community had to accomplish a goal to take down a larger target. Things like that in MMO‚Äôs make the community feel like they are working for a common goal
---
It‚Äôs doable in most cases. Been a solo player in Xbox since Y1S1 of the first game in the 360, even beat Crotah solo. It‚Äôs doable, but hard.
---
I‚Äôm gonna load my ace and kill him and crack his skull and shape some pieces into bullets and use them to kill him again and it will be an endless loop mwahahahahah die FOR CASDYE!!!
---
Looks cool! I like the concept and art for last gasp!
---
Yup, feels bad when you get killed by a super, just to spawn and get killed by the same super
---
Me with the Last Word quest at three in the morning.
---
We don‚Äôt need anymore titan nades going around and getting healed during a fight sounds too strong
---
Thank you Smile-boi-commander
---
NO IM NOT READY ITS BEEN A YEAR AND IM STILL NOT READY ILL NEVER BE READY
---
I feel like that still isn‚Äôt enough :/ it‚Äôll be helpful, but OeM will still dominate the Titan exotic meta.
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox I can help
---
Yes
---
I think freelance comp was a really good catering to the solo community. I have really enjoyed queuing up in freelance anyways...
---
Mad
---
most arw situational and harder to activate. I personally dont think wall hacks should be in any game with pvp it's unfair but when it comes to the hunter and warlock its not as bad but still lame over all. I'm sorry if i seemd hostile earlier
---
You forgot the first rule...
---
and the biggest part is waiting until next season that annoys me the most about this entire thing
---
i honestly cannot wait for guardian!Uldren. as much as i hated him for what he did in Forsaken, his character has always been so fascinating to me and he‚Äôs one of my favourites. it‚Äôll be interesting to see what he does with his new life, and what his relationship with his adorable little ghost will be like c‚Äô:
---
I think Warframe offers a fair method of earning the items. Sure, theyre expensive but youre given the option to trade and grind for it.
---
Wouldnt work in destiny 2 since you cant trade for goods anyway
---
The issue is that it requires a 100 power handicap.  does 5 of swords still work?
---
Counterpoint: I should be able to make my Synthoceps match the rest of my seasonal ornaments.
---
Pink GREEN Pink Pink Pink
---
One of these things is not like the others, one of these things is GARISH.
---
I would rather deal with OEM right now instead of sniper fusion rifles.
---
That edit was pure GENIUS might I say! xD
---
mind blowned if this becomes truth
---
Nice.
---
Best of luck
---
Bungie has a thing for 7‚Äôs
---
With you there, especially with armour 2.0. Finding new pieces of armour once I‚Äôve settled into a set with perks and such that I like, isn‚Äôt the same as before armour 2.0.
---
Now, it‚Äôs just like ‚Äúok, more shards‚Äù, instead of checking perks to see if it fits what I want better.
---
Ah okay
---
You should have the option to turn it into an ornament for an amount of bright dust.
---
One side of me wants to help new uldren  but I also really want to shoot him in the face again
---
And that‚Äôs for players that were playing before new light. New players get access to one set of ornaments, from the season pass, and it‚Äôs only the paid version, and it‚Äôs at the end, AND the only other available ones cost silver.
---
Oh yea I see this bastard all the time, he is good :D
---
Quit destiny forever and whenever someone wants to flex something just wipe that out
---
How did you know what to look for in a clan? New Light solo here.
---
Play one more match or sign out and back in and it‚Äôll probably get fix
---
Or just never claim another one of those so you stay this score forever
---
ESPECIALLY iron banner gear.
---
*Well of Radiance*
---
Could you please help my friend? He's a great solo player but cant find a clan that's happy to do raids since he's never done one before.
---
Or just the armor that takes a bit more effort to earn. Like Raid gear, Iron Banner gear, Solstice gear (Yes I'm a little salty after grinding out 2 sets of Solstice gear they were useless within minutes)
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Even this I'd be happy with, Eververse ornaments are cool and all, but gives a tad bit more options
---
Because it is the only exotic worth using. Titans have really bad PvP exotics. Only Dunemarchers can be decent, but are still nowhere close to how good OEM is.
---
If not all legendary gear, then at least allow drops of high stat rolls on gear that is currently unable to be obtained with high stat rolls (ie reverie dawn can‚Äôt be obtained with 60 natural stats
---
Give us a system that lets us turn armor pieces into ornaments.  
---
like, say, go to banshee, turn in like 10k glimmer, some lego shards, related area mats, and whatever tier upgrade trinket you want, and then it becomes an ornament you can put on ANY armor of that type. Heads to heads, chest to chest, so on so fourth
---
Congrats. I‚Äôm at 10%
---
Mecha*
---
This üëÜ
---
Nice
---
Idk, dunemarchers, Perrigrine greaves, skullfort, synthoceps, feedback fence is really good with the Thunder Coil build. There‚Äôs heart of inmost light too and it‚Äôs really good. If you use it right, ashen wake can be really good for a clean up on a sunspot build.
---
That is a valid point, but even if it was only for PvE or client-side, it is a bit disappointing when you get things such as the Season Pass set or even (I assume) the sets purchased with Silver for things such as FotL
---
Im ok with oem, but the target assistant is annoying...  So nerf to the pinnacles would be more "fair".   ?    (P.S. first titan I've somewhat agreed with in a while)
---
I've actually drawn her already, she's just taking two extra months to upload because I'm too lazy to fix the stopped upload /s
---
M+kb is inherently more accurate to use than a controller. Controller is better for driving and fighting games though (and there are better options than the basic controllers for those)
---
thats a big ‚Äúif‚Äù u r talking there, whereas skullfort litterally takes a kill to charge back, and well not everyone has it AND use it, let alone the amount of titans in each game is already lesser
---
Holy SHIT. It seems Bungie took my exact recommendations for how to balance OEM **AND** Recluse
---
It still works on 90% of armor, and I don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôd work as a client side setting.
---
Yeah..... I know right!?
---
Laugh in foetracer
---
We're talking OeM right?
---
He got a curated Hammerhead which is why it has the shader
---
That‚Äôs what I thought, but I‚Äôm a savage and idiot and use a controller on PC and I haven‚Äôt noticed any difference between me and other players, I assume that most PC players use a M+KB. Also I‚Äôm not bragging about my skills, I‚Äôm mediocre at best... I would be interested in crossplay. But I think that there should be a trial or beta run for pc and consoles
---
yes
---
Ya thats a relief. That overshield was way too strong, put it on a future exotic. Although the wall hacks are still borderline op. Maybe add a maximum range or lower the duration?
---
Might as well see if we can't get a few from the drifter. Shin's gonna be pissed with us if he finds out. So we might as well be prepared. But I don't think our boy would disappoint.
---
Colonel is alive. He's in the hangar where Cause used to be.
---
I dis with my leader but I miss to cap and next I play my warlock with finisher at the same as another hunter do but no one cares about my post T-T
---
It's still trash.
---
But your set is ruined due to the fact your have one piece off. And I see your point with the client side, but honestly I‚Äôd be happy if even it was just disabled in PvP, but then again why would it matter, some Ornaments give you a damage boost due to the length, and that‚Äôs been an issue for a fair while.
---
"Shaxx... Im scared"
---
TIL that Colonel is still alive and hanging out at the farm, where it gets cold at night, so someone really needs to get him a cloak or something to keep warm
---
I see uou have killed the ascendant primeval but haven't spoken to drifter
---
Based on the amount of bitching and whining here on leddit it's not gonna be enough. They're still going to be cucked by titans. Maybe on some level it's an l2p issue? When oem is gone there's nothing to put the blame on anymore.
---
Target assistant?
---
No wonder GMs are often completely useless.
---
Yes this was the issue. I changed to toggle and it worked but i hate playing with toggle. Pretty old post but should have added this information somewhere
---
Still gets instant health regen though :/
---
Um... I am now sad to realize that Im tapking about to different things thinking originally that they were the same...
---
The firing squad is all armed with mountaintops, recluses and jade rabbit's.
---
Nah, this is my titan, I got my Dredgen on my Hunter back in Black Armory!
---
i've added more screenshots w\\without fastball in different location. it's clearly no difference - grenade always lands on the same spot. maybe i've got a bug? can you do same measurements, please?
---
You can literally check the roster
---
Realized OEM(One eyed) and the target assistant for the certain melees
---
it wasnt until now? maybe? which nerfed it kinda?, idk , it still well tracks, removal of overshield isnt that big of a deal srsly
---
That‚Äôs with guns, and that‚Äôs a much bigger issue. The ornament issue was with one gun, and one ornament. It only gave a small range boost. And alternatively, you could build your look around a cool exotic.
---
I can verify, having bought the digital copy, the game takes up 90.11 GB on my PS4.  As such, you need over 100GB of free space.  I have no idea id having the disc makes any difference.
---
Sorry cap
---
And us day1 players that have spent 160 - 200+ dollars on it depending on your countries currency?
---
It's a good nerf but not enough imo. Tracking is a way worse problem than overshield. They dont even need to remove tracking just reduce the up time by half or something. OEM is basically 4 exotics put into one (overshield + tracking + damage buff + hp regen). Removing one of those perk the thing is still OP just a little bit less.
---
Some of the Iron Banner stuff CAN be used as ornaments. If they are IB Ornaments. I‚Äôm not sure about the Truage set specifically, but try pulling the IB ornaments from collections. You should be able to apply them.
---
They can call it whatever they want, that doesn't make it so. An MMO isn't defined by the number of total users, it's defined by the number of users in the same instance/activity. A match in Battlefield has more concurrent players than any activity or social space in Destiny. Does that make Battlefield an MMO? Of course not. Destiny has *influences* of the MMO genre and *influences* of the RPG genre, all of which sit on top of an FPS core.
---
That said, the hybrid nature of the game renders all of these labels unimportant anyway. If we can admit that this game does not fit neatly into one specific genre, then it's also silly to say "it's a [x] game so you can't do [y]". If you aren't constrained by rigid definitions, then you are free to cater to different audiences. You can have activities/achievements that are designed for teams *and* you can also have activities/activities that are designed for solo players.
---
There's a balance between making it a chore, and having no grind at all. The main complaints of Y1 wasn't about the quality of the content itself, but due to the fact that you quickly obtained all the loot in the game, leading to no more loot to chase. Universal armor ornaments run into the same issue, as they are unlocked forever, removing them from the loot pool. 
---
Also, it's pretty immature to downvote posts just because they disagree with your opinion :^)
---
What the heck i had that preordered and i didnt reciece any email. Bogus!
---
Call of Duty Tomahawk  \*intensifies\*
---
Looks like Xol did a little work....
---
You can trade stuff in Warframe for the premium currency so you can still buy MTX without spending a dime of real life cash.  I wish Destiny would mimic this.
---
*Void Grenades with Debuff from SP*
---
The damage buff used to be more of an issue because it turned Ace with Momento Mori proc‚Äôd into a two tap.
---
They‚Äôre still complaining about OEM even though this update hasn‚Äôt happened
---
It‚Äôs currently not possible
---
or they could add like a "second" slot for gear that you have to "equip" the gear in but that slot is just for looks
---
WTF where's the Recluse?
---
At least allow to unlock it as ornament for money like 3-5$ for a set.
---
Wait it rains on Titan? 
---
*cries in low settings*
---
Ha! I had the exact same thing happen to me when I was going for recluse this season. One game away, I was on a win streak, and then a 1 v 3.
---
 I just jumped off the map until the game was over. One of the guys on the other team messaged me about how it sucks when people quit the game. And  another one added me as a friend.
---
It's not even a good nerf. Just use the void Titan Subclass that give you overshield with melee kill and you have the same mask as before.
---
They should have allowed us to unlock the armor skin as ornament when we unlock the armor. Why do have to look like a fucking dumpster with miss match armor just because the stat is good? Wow, gw2 and many other older games have transmog/transmute function. Why destiny dont have it?
---
I always use my finisher for heavy ammo creation. Really Handy.
---
Liked it
---
im losing progress from really bad matches when you barely get a kill in!   
---
for example momentum control i got into this really bad game where the opposing team was just sniping us one after another, we lost 125-200 that game lol   
---
another bad survival match   
---
it was also late at night and i was tired but i was greedy when i was able to push it from 70% to 81% after the first survival match
---
More like ;'(
---
They already said that it isn‚Äôt good, and they‚Äôre asking what changes you would make to it. 
---
Saying that there are better options doesn‚Äôt really answer anything.
---
thats what i mostly do in survival playlist matches
---
I think even just a 2 second reduction so it only lasts 6 seconds would be suffice. 2 seconds is a lot in a PVP scenario in my opinion.
---
im enjoying it as well, was never really an FPS PVPer but destiny 2 just pulls me in somehow   
---
when i get slightly competitive i lose all my edge and just become...angry   
---
broken 2 controllers b/c of it (my secret is out, i play with a DS4 on PC)
---
i follow that strategy as well, ill just be even MORE safe, wont get greedy to finish the progress
---
he said it is useless, and it isnt, i did said my opinion on how it should improve, it is u who doesnt answer anything and instead think it would be better to argue with me
---
At the very least last seasons crucible and vanguard armour should‚Äôve been made into ornaments because I miss my hunter vanguard legs so badly
---
PSA? Nah I prefer SGA
---
Sounds like baby needs his diaper changed.
---
I like my ACD feedback fence anyway.
---
Might actually be true tbh there was that bit where she was smiling while touching that object...definitely shell be a big bad one way or the other she got corrupted or its the real savathun...or she got posessed
---
You need to wait until Tangled Shore becomes the flashpoint and grind the heroic adventures.
---
Control gives valor. It's not competitive.
---
Looks straight outa Star Wars
---
I've binned about 3 this week and infused 1, so yep it's still there
---
MK.44 stand asides with bottom sentinel for the suppressing shoulder charge and overshield
---
Have you beaten forsaken?
---
Heck yeah friend! Just pm me and I can send an invite to the clan. And join the discord if you‚Äôd like  updates on when we are raiding
---
No.
---
MT is fine. Recluse is being nerfed anyway so we will see how that goes.
---
I love seeing this bs because its so hilarious to see a guardian yeeting himself
---
I would rather Bungie to keep it B2P and have no microtransactions. Or at least give players who bought the game something.
---
If a weapon gets you kills, stick to it.
---
Fuck all. I don‚Äôt even think it‚Äôs the best of its weapon type.
---
Because thorn is cool and exotic quest weapons usually hold more value than rng drops.
---
Yes change my diaper daddy
---
that's a good idea! :) thanks!
---
hmmm
---
ok, gotcha!
---
Ok thanks
---
If only the IB legs in game were this thin :(
---
It sounds like you straight up hate 2/3rds of destiny and sorta don‚Äôt like the other 3rd. Why do you play still?
---
No worries friend, always happy to help! :)
---
yeah because of F2P Accounts and Steam access. PVE hacking is really small wiener confirmed
---
But like you said it‚Äôs COMP. This game mode is supposed to be a test of skill not a test to see who has the highest TTK, how is there any competition there?
---
PREACH
---
Wrong nerf. Use the void tree that gives an overshield and you've still got the same mask. I'm upset the recluse got nerfed though.
---
And i cant get up
---
It actually is for PvE. Not in PvP tho
---
they're not trying to impress anyone, they're there to win.
---
It needs to stay underused. This weapon has always been a monster.
---
That being said, the Merciless has more utility than the Thorn, but it IS a secondary and not much primary Exotic plays these days
---
Not anymore
---
Laughs in Contraverse Hold
---
Where i can get that awesome pic?
---
Take your hand and cover your left eye. What are you then? One-Eyed.
---
Well, bubbles are not the best super tbh. They don't just block incoming, they block outgoing, so they're great if you're seriously hurt and need a second, but that's about it. The low wall is great, pop that and crouch and shoot. But sooner or later you'll have to step out of that bubble and if everyone's been in it and not shooting at the enemy... the situation has not improved much. 
---
But just one guy's opinion, I'm maining a Warlock, too.
---
But that's not how eyes work...
---
Nope
---
It's okay I forgive cutie
---
No quest mate it‚Äôs just a friendly doggo as the only dog in destiny died on the moon
---
You can pick up two exotic quest for Ada-1 for the Jotunn and Le Monarque which requires you to complete 10 legendary frames and Kill Fallen and Vex with Fusion rifles. But to get the 1K, Anarchy and Terrabah require to do the raid.
---
Remember when Warlocks had cool armor? Now we look like bobble head figurines
---
*Nailed it.*
---
yeah i'm surprised we managed to win one round.
---
Makes me laugh crying hunters got they way again. All ya going to see is shoulder charging skull forts well done you brought this on yourselves snow flakes.
---
So the body damage does still get a small boost, it just won‚Äôt be on par with precision damage?
---
If you actually read the patch notes, it's getting a buff.So just be patient and wait
---
Naah, some good, some bad.
---
Not having friends that have forsaken
---
Borealis
---
Man, sherpa-ing is one of the most fun things to do in this game. Given the people you sherpa are willing to learn how to do it, that's part of the reason I've done whisper, and zero hour so much
---
Shaxx says it
---
I already made it my desktop background, it brings me satisfaction to Alt F4 after a crucible match and see that.
---
Not a titan main, but this photo honestly gives me sad vibes
---
I agree on content outside of raids need to be fun aswell but I have seen many player complain because they can't do everything solo. Yeah sucks for you, sure. But this is still an online-game and it was never intended to be a solo experience. If that's what people are looking for, it's simply the wrong game for them.
---
The counterpart to that would be me buying The Witcher 3 and complaing there is no multiplayer or 20 man raids like in WoW.
---
Id like it between console versions but not with the PC port because of m&amp;k, increased fps, increased fov and hackers.
---
I wish instead of just getting ornaments you could infuse a specific piece of gear as an ornament. The only reason I would like to see this is because there are certain armor sets that look good but are not considered endgame so the roll with garbage stats and if I want to look a certain way I can't because I'll be sacrificing an 80+ masterworked for a bad roll. You could even make it require specific materials that are rare so people can't transmog things all the time. Put them in 950 or 980 activities as a random drop.
---
He a bit confused, but he got the spirit
---
PvE hacking is a lot less offensive to me than PvP, though. I mean, it's ridiculous but at least you're making things better for the human players, more or less. 
---
In PvP you're murdering players due to everyone not playing on a level playing field, which is assholery on a high level. Much worse, in my book.
---
skullfort is ok tho.
---
Yeah cuz only hunters were crying right? Lets ignore the people crying about the easily counterable arc battery dodge, even proper titan mains were annoyed by the damn mask. It was a ridiculous training wheel that made some "titans" cry that there's no other exotics for them that are usable which is bullshit. Just no exotic that holds your little hands like that damn masl does. The community altogether got their way, after a YEAR of that stupid thing dictating the titan meta. And it is worth it. Titans always shoulder charged you no matter what, aint nothing's gonna change. But now no snowballing apes with overshields.
---
I think you should be able to make armour into ornaments, maybe once you've dismantled them enough times? Still encourages you to work for it, while also rewarding you if you've had a series of bad rolls.
---
Honestly, its likely due to the consoles. They probably just landed on what they are going to do with the one eyed mask and recluse and xenophage.
---
Do you know how consoles work for updates? The update needs to be submitted to Sony/Microsoft for certification for the updates. It normally takes about a month. Pc games don't require certifications (at least through steam) and the consoles do. And since crosssave is a feature now, the game needs to be on the same version on all platforms.
---
One of the bigger ones is Warframe. The pc gets updates weekly, and it just gets bundled up into a big update for the consoles, and they get it about 4-5 weeks later. And the delay is soley due to the console certifications. There are other games as well, but I'm on the Warframe reddit all the time and there are people almost daily asking when consoles are getting the new update.
---
Helen Keller didn't need to see for people to catch hands, she hand her hands all over the place like a true titan
---
Or, atleast all old non-randomly rolled armor.  I would love to rock my annihilator armor set from early trialsüëåüèª
---
Giggles in Peregrine Greaves
---
nah it should be full screen, but with literally no depth of field
---
I thought the same thing because I‚Äôve heard people just randomly getting it. However, my way is just a guaranteed way to get it if you have no time on while wearing the mask.
---
Hold E?
---
I‚Äôm in this group. I played comp for the first time ever this month, just to unlock this for PVE, and now it feels like a wasted grind. Nothing more than kill clip without reloading or rampage that can‚Äôt stack. Pinnacle schminnacle.
---
I'm just seeing a bunch of pilgrims rushing a dreg with flintlocks and I'm laughing to myself
---
Former soldier. Never put your finger on the trigger and never point a gun at something you do not intend to kill, real gun or not.
---
Same dude lol
---
Glad I'm not the only one üòÇ
---
Are you for real?
---
For other exotic quests if you like pulse rifles than definitely try for the outbreak perfected
---
If you have forsaken than work on the ace of spades.
---
Also get the Sturn from nesus world quests
---
Pretty much just get all the quests you can and just try to work on them side by side
---
Run a different class I thought the same till I ran middle tree voidwalker with the contraverse hold gauntlets unlimited handheld blasts really feels like a warlock and as for amor yea it does look feminine which is why I made a female warlock and out of all the warlock armor designs my favorite has to be the chest piece you get from leveling up your season rank to 20
---
I dont know what to do... For one side, i want to buy the expansions, but on the other, i didnt finished half of the free content and want to wait the sales...
---
Thanks for the answer !
---
My 1st exotic, ahhhh the present (new light player)
---
Hmmm I don‚Äôt know sounds like a pretty good idea honestly I‚Äôd think it be kinda fun running around with quick fang the whole game like a ninja
---
Is that queen elsa
---
Aight sweet will do cheers :)
---
instead of that swords should get a damage boost and the legendary swords should deal almost as much damage as the whisper of worm. Or a better idea would be to either bring back or make new exotic swords like in D1. Even the Iron Lord sword from D1 would be awesome.
---
Like playing borderlands split screen
---
PvP only players will continue to complain until PvE is boring and everyone else leaves
---
Theres no dailies anymore so now there is 2 powerful rewards from the playlist. 1 for playing 4 games in a rotating playlist and 1 for playing 4 games in a "permanent" playlist.
---
Along with this shaxx (and other tower venders) give out powerfuls for completing 8 of their specific bounties as well as having 2 weeklies that dont give much more than XP, glimmer, bright dust.
---
I don‚Äôt think cloaks count as cross dressing but nonetheless I agree as the only good set is opulent scholar visually or but the best is emperors minister set visually and gear stat
---
Come on bruh, just hold E
---
What ? I was asleep for the most some time I guess 
---
 An update ? Is it here ? When who where
---
If that were the case, they would need damaged reduced to a 2 or 3 hit kill in crucible. That would make them more useless in pve too though.
---
Yes my fav weapon was the Vex Mythocast and just saying that idea sounds amazing they should bring the Vault of Glass back tbh
---
Is it back out again
---
The armors elemental type I'm pretty sure it just effects what armor mods you can get on it and it also effects the damage you TAKE from certain elements but the difference in that is usually unnoticeable
---
Subclass and weapons just affect how quickly you can take down elemental shields. Arc takes down arc and so on. Armor is only based around mods. Each element has specific mods that can be used.
---
Think I'm gonna do that, at least with Hunters and Titans Bungie actually stayed close to their inspirations.
---
Me ...,....... I don't have ome so I don't mind
---
*Whispered breathing*
---
If you don‚Äôt care for stats, then the way it is right now won‚Äôt affect you at all. You can just do the activity you want to get the armor you want.
---
Eververse has always been a mess. I for one don‚Äôt care as much. I will get what I want with the bright dust i had. If I can‚Äôt afford it with those it doesn‚Äôt matter. Been that way since D1 and I still don‚Äôt care about it. Plus all eververse armor is basically ornaments so if you been playing since y1 you basically had everything already. The only eververse exclusive item will be the 1 set of each class from the current season.
---
The game grind is basically to min/max your gear. Armors design is cosmetics only and doesn‚Äôt affect your gameplay at all.
---
A lot of guns use glimmer to make the rounds in the chamber. Their magazines are glimmer 'batteries' and it's how we get more than 6 rounds in a 6 round revolver cylinder. 
---
Ammo packs are just packs of glimmer, which is how we get ammo for all weapons from the same pickup, Ghost just makes the glimmer into ammo for whatever gun we are using. Primary/special/heavy is only a gameplay limitation.
---
My favorite was "Choda, Shaft of Crota" that was a fun crucible match lol
---
The armor energy affects the mods. That's it. Arc, solar, and void armor energy each have specific mods that aren't available to the other energies. And weapon energy only affects the damage to enemy shields. In pve you need to match the energy type to the shield to break it easier. 
---
In short, using solar armor while playing a void or arc subclass changes nothing with your actual power. It only affects the available mods on the armor. Use what you want. Weapons dont affect class power either.
---
And if you get the astrocyte verse exotic helmet and master the blink jump you‚Äôll definitely feel like a warlock
---
If they're supposed to be light abilities Bungie needs to be more clear on that. Axion Bolt is the only grenade in the game not called a grenade. Flavor text matters.
---
Bruh

I'm at work now, but I'll join when I get home.

NYOOOOOOOOOOOOMMM

Did u re bind your interact button?
---
No, just no
---
I just love using it as a better SMG. I laugh when people try to switch to recluse on me when I'm already close with Cerberus. They never win.
---
@Bungie PLEASE
---
I honestly don't even remember where I got it. I want to say I got it from banshee. But it was late and I was tired. Just remember seeing it in my inventory after I completed some stuff for him.
---
Just googled it.ni remember doing these steps. So I guess this was it.

---
While I can agree that 8 sec wall hacks is a bit much for OEM, I cannot say the same about removing the entire ability. 
---
I‚Äôve seen people here, on this very subreddit, saying that they won‚Äôt be happy until the tracking is removed from OEM (they can stay upset to be honest). The tracking should never go, not with other classes having access to wall hacks through exotics and sub classes. 
---
Also hunters have access to a 9 sec wall hacks, see more than one target, invisibility and no radar detection and it‚Äôs not on a cool down. So if we are reducing OEM‚Äôs 8 seconds wall hacks, night stalker should get the same treatment it‚Äôs only fair.
---
Same here, got kicked from destiny servers when i was on survival and when i finally could come back to the game ( my internet didnt crashed ), i had this message...
---
true true but at least that seems like some seasonal japes that'll go away in a few weeks (though i guess that depends on the mods next season, heh)
---
I just noticed the top left. Lawd he comin
---
I think everyone who plays Iron Banner wants the old D1 armor back. It looks way better than what we have now.
---
it is really fun, can't even lie
---
The destiny 2 companion. It lets you view your character, your gear, and it lets you join and create fireteams for whatever you need üëåüèº
---
It‚Äôs 8 seconds, and yes it‚Äôs still a lot. 
---
I didn‚Äôt say that Titans took the short end of a stick or anything, I‚Äôm saying as long as others have it then why not titans. Read what people say carefully, so you won‚Äôt make the mistake of assuming they said something they didn‚Äôt, and start your arguments from a flawed base. 
---
Bungie can tune the marked for vengeance buff more or they won‚Äôt, it‚Äôs entirely dependent on the stats we‚Äôll have next season, it‚Äôs up to them. And if OEM is proven to be over performing again, then they can adjust the duration of the wall hacks, or even assign the triggering conditions to a fixed value of health (like the buff will activate if you lose 50 hp or something). Removing the entire buff however is totally not happening, or rather shouldn‚Äôt be happening because everyone deserves wall hacks if 2 out of 3 characters have it. 
---
Bungie totally did the right thing with this nerf to OEM, it may seem like nothing to you, but in reality it might makes an actual difference. People need to calm their pants.
---
Same. The Lady and I just started our own, 2 person clan.
---
Sorry but no. It‚Äôs not that hard , and it‚Äôs actually refreshing to have to push yourself to play well, instead of just breezing through content.
---
This can also apply to many LFG groups üòÇ
---
Is g√∏√∂d
---
the super is pretty short lived but have you ever seen a warlock nova-skate right at you ? terrifying speed haha.

It sure is though and it's lovely

Nobody even mentions my boy Doomfang?

Oh yeahhhh that HEAVY bricc gives me Delerium

Yeah, they did a really good job with this one

They still have Wall hacks, and that‚Äôs my point.

MnK but ye... i got it last year from a bright engram for fotl along with cat shell
---
Scroll down and maybe you'd see that I realized that on my own.
---
Nice I enjoy gambit as well!
---
Really, making the base content free has been an absolute stroke of genius on Bungies part. They have probably made more than they would have by offering the game free.
---
Nice, thanks
---
Happened to me last season when i mentioned it and everyone got upset i said it was broken due to back up plan making it impossible to beat at any range 
---
im surprised people wanted recluse nerfed because i know how hard people crutch that weapon

My dad in a nutshell
---
the mask will grant an oversheild if you kill an enemy, by any means, who has caused you damage. taking the oversheild away is a pretty substantial nerf. now when a Titan with oem kills my teammate next to me, he doesn't immediately gain 100 health by oversheild, so i actually have a chance to kill him. the wall hacks are still bullshit and i agree they need to be addressed, but i think this nerf will be a nice change to the sandbox. recluse is getting a nerf too which should make my life less... depressing lol
---
damn that's a lucky engram haha, i had to grind so much brightdust for that cat. worth it though
---
Right, but OP and most people's point is not necessarily that the wallhack is the issue, it's how it's much easier to gain/frequent, and how long the duration.
---
For instance, it's cool warlocks and their team can gain markers, but they're stuck in a 6m circle. It doesn't track enemies outside a fairly small area, and you can't maneuver to close a gap or flank. It's the way a wallhack exotic SHOULD be. That's the point we're generally trying to make. OEM is cool, but it's laughable how long it's gone untouched.
---
Gun looks awesome, the way dude is holding it irks me for several reasons...
---
Literally me in a few matches. But it should still be good to ok in PvE
---
*Insert implied Kirby meme here*
---
See that's where you're wrong. You would be fighting people, your team mates who will be causing wipes left and right with stupid ideas. Look at menagerie people still fail at that. It's easier mechanics than any of the raids and people still fail encounters. And you can even be revived infinely or respawn in menagerie.
---
It also looks weird being held left handed
---

thats cool its now just better then the old wormhusk with foetracer.

---
I'm not gonna lie, that gun looks like it would make an awesome exotic linear fusion (in the energy slot of course).
---
You could work on exit strategy this time I suppose
---
Why?
---
I got Luna's howl before it got nerfed so I know your pain boys. It'll still be good though
---
You mean the FUN mode ! Don't nerf
---
There are better hand cannons for crucible.
---
"and that's why we have fireteams"
---
I am torn here, as a friend of mine, who I respect as a great gamer, convinced me that the shield was the major problem, despite my own impression that the wallhack was. That impression was also fuelled by a 1-on-1-session I had, where I lost each and every duel against an OEM-titan because he just knew where I would peak and could prefire. (And in an 1-on-1, the overshield does not play any role, as it is gone before the next 1-on-1 starts.)
---
Or both because P2P.
---
Oooooh let me be the Mando

Very kind of you to wear the biggest mask possible in a game type with 1 hit headshot kills.

at this time of day

Yeah got it yesterday then nerf was was all over yt
---
In this part of the country?
---
A toaster is just a death beam with a smaller power supply, don‚Äôt forget it
---
Worst part for me is the drop after totem. I haven't had one run without dying.
---
Oh good!! Its pay to slack off.
---
localized entirely within your kitchen?
---
yup. quickly becomes a game of survival. scrambling around trying not to die. I enjoy it.
---
Yes!
---
Yep
---
Every class has something the other classes consider OP. The higher the skill level of the player the more broken that class will look.
---
You can do raids, you have 4 people, just lfg two pugs. My clan and my friends do that all the time. I've been playing a lot of 3 man content with a bud and pugging the third.
---
I‚Äôm going to lose my shit.
---
I got it last weekend. Wasn‚Äôt actually very difficult, surprisingly. 
---
That said, as soon as I started using it in PvE I knew it had to go. I‚Äôll just enjoy it while it‚Äôs around and see where it becomes useful later.
---
It isn't really Friday until reset. He should be somewhere now.
---
Yeah, some people afk grind or semi afk grind strikes, gambit and crucible
---
Can we pull Zenobia-D off the roster already? Most people including new lights have at least 5 sitting around somewhere like its glitter prank gone wrong.
---
i wasn't making a design suggestion, i was lamenting the fact that i think the nerf is too soft /again./ not really here to argue.
---
You know something, as a titan main (Play all 3) I'm so sick of everyone complaining about titans are broken. OEM was broke, got it. What other pvp exotics do titans have? We got great pve exotics but lacking pvp.
---
Weapon medals
---
Recluse is probably more of a pve nerf than pvp. Which makes this nerf a really really good balance.
---
Why should you be rewarded for dying? And why should the enemy team be penalized for Killing you in a PvP game. This doesn't make any sense.
---
undoubtedly haha
---
"just jump" lol you must be playing against trash cans.
---
I lowkey feel like people who complained about the overshield but not the wallhacks are the people who run into encounters with no plan whatsoever and need something to blame for getting swatted away
---
The real pain was from being at an immediate and significant disadvantage in 1v1s, where all opportunities to outplay your opponent were squashed
---
Fair enough.
---
Except for almsot every single Titan I've seen post on this subreddit.  From what I've seen none of us like or use OEM either. lol
---
No exotic artifact or banner? Filthy casual.
---
Like literally why put a gun in the rotation that everyone can get easily throw a quest.  How are Bungie getting away with shit like this.
---
Ahh Ana bae.
---
Only real titans use synthoceps, skull fort, worm god or dune marchers.
---
Melee pvp best pvp
---
this is true but oem pushes those other exotics out due to being the recluse of titan neutral game exotics, which makes for a stale meta.
---
It has to be a bug hopefully they change it if not such a disappointment for xur this week

Can you plz post the link/s as to where people have been asking for a pve nerf I'd like to read their take on the situation.

I wih i could give you some glim because somehow im maxed at 250k
---
It was riskrunner, but then changed to Prometheus Lense.
---
thanks for the info :)
---
The PvP nerfs I can easily understand but it makes no sense for PvE. Its not like the bots are going to form some sort of union and demand player weapons get nerfed.
---
Most of my titan buddies in a nutshell tbh
---
I'm still sad I didn't get online to buy it at lunch that day and missed out
---
I can hear this picture.
---
Synthoceps is epic
---
You're welcome.
---
I do. Standard ttk in crucible is 1 second. Recluse with MOA has a ttk of .47 seconds, literally the fastest in the game. And the next closest ttk assumes all headshots. It can quite literally kill 2 people faster and easier than any other gun can kill 1 person. You can‚Äôt honestly tell me you don‚Äôt see a problem with that.
---
Also you can cover half a standard crucible map in 5 seconds, so even that analogy is flawed. As long as you are able to find a person to shoot within 5 seconds you can keep MOA up continuously. Sure it‚Äôll go down sometimes after you‚Äôve wiped the entire enemy team, but the situation you propose is the situation this gun is the most OP in.
---
While you‚Äôre at it bring back wolf head cloak
---
I'm sorry I don't rely on vendors for the items I want, I put in work
---
Ha, I got that as a drop yesterday, after waiting months for a trace rifle drop. Of course this would happen.
---
I got full auto and outlaw on my claws but it has a RS masterwork
---
Would you rather the sleeper meta again?
---
It's not blame if its factual evidence my man
---
A new expansion? I thought it was fairly self explanatory
---
Borealis is one of my favorite guns actually! But ever since the lunafactions nerf i havent really used it because you can't cheese the empowered perk with bottomless magazines
---
I've tested smoke bombs and it doesn't stop tracking
---
That looks awesome, but also looks as if...it was painful to make it.
---
Ah the good ol WTS Rubico +Crit chance +crit damage +Multishot -impact Riven GOD ROLL 4000plat
---
You're completely right, there are already threads whining about warlock hh supernova. But no one will mention arc battery hunter. this sub is pathetic
---
I got it day 1
---
You've been lucky, its especially bad in comp
---
Yes - Breakneck definitely does, it‚Äôs my favorite Auto rifle because it feels a little more realistic.
---
I agree completely, but when was the last time you saw a rant about "warlock op plz nerf"? This sub LOVES to complain about titans.
---
420 shards.. nice.
---
I report them emeditly becuase I'm not gonna have a cheater on destiny destiny 2 is agame for fun and adventure not so you can be the greatest guardian on the planet I'm only a lvl 929 and I'm pretty good at crucible and regular raids I dont need up to 5 exotics on each slot  so if your like this guy then go fight yourself with game share and find out how hard it is to fight YOU.
---
wormgod caress and bottom tree striker is the shit
---
But it's a great way to escape tho.
---
how do you know that? have you played it yet? no? thought so. so relax and see. i'm just saying i woulda liked to see the adjustment the other way around.
---
Well now I use the RatKing exotic SideArm with my entire fireteam of six in crucible and PVE, and Raids which makes it very effective against enemies
---

FIST
---
Winning would be removing all wall hacks from pvp.  No other FPS gas built in wall hacks...
---
Swords don't have shotgun range, max kill range for shotguns is 15 in-game meters (chaperone). You have to be right in someone's face if you want to kill with swords. Just keep the exotics swords in the heavy slot like what they did with exotic snipers and shotguns. Shotguns would definitely still have a good place in crucible if swords were available in special. But I totally agree with you on pve. I just want to use swords without sacrificing my heavy slot.
---
*Laughs in Truth*
---
F\^3
---
That was just a good ole fashioned good play t√≠o
---
I would still say still skill was in there, either way nice clip :)
---
absolutely no sense for PvE. should we nerf Randy‚Äôs Throwing Knife while we‚Äôre at it? it‚Äôs the most unstoppable scout rifle in the game and out does the Jade Rabbit and Mida so why not nerf it as well since it‚Äôs better than the two best exotic pvp scout rifles. i just don‚Äôt see why the recluse is getting so much hate when i have no problem going up against people with it. I even use it and it‚Äôs not 100% guaranteeing a kill even with master of arms activated. of course it‚Äôs a very powerful weapon but that‚Äôs what pinnacle weapons are suppose to be like. i have no problem with bygones and it‚Äôs ridiculously overpowered. if you‚Äôre having problems with it run a shotgun, sniper, scout rifle, or fusion rifle. i easily get beat by those when using recluse because it‚Äôs a smg
---
Four months ago it was all complaints about spectral, before that was blade barrage, then Nova Warp, then Hunters for literally all of year one. It's not Titans specifically, just the most op class at the time.
---
Doesn't that only increase Primary ammo drops?
---
As a hunter main, I'd like to apologise to everyone that thought I was t-bagging them when I was trying to dodge but forgot it wasn't charged yetüòÇ
---
Probably a mistake from Bungie, riskrunner was there last week and before that also and it's also obtainable from a quest.
---
LFG discord! Also if you DM me im always bringing the people i bring into my own discord to go on raids and exotic quests and stuff. Ive memorized most of them so I just run people through them for fun!
---
But^I^like^space^shaman armor
---
I think everyone is happy besides the titans who use OEM, im a titan but I dont use OEM.
---
Bungie is doing gods work
---
i‚Äôm just saying there‚Äôs ways to beat recluse but those who don‚Äôt want to adjust and adapt to beat it want the developers to kill it. which without taking master of arms away i don‚Äôt think recluse will be going anywhere
---
Yeah I already have it and was hoping for something new. Any idea what the problem is?
---
With the changes to damage perks 21% Delirium replaced Hammerhead in a lot of load outs. I still use Hammerhead (Feeding Frenzy, Rampage/Rampage Spec) a lot in PVE for it's stability and range. I took Hammerhead into the 980 Ordeal and it performed fine, whereas I don't think I'd want to be in the effective Delirium ranges just as I wouldn't take Recluse into the 980 and expect to do well. I usually keep both with me though.
---
The black ranger is getting kicked
---
...do...do you know what RNG is? Just because you play the game more doesn‚Äôt mean you get more exotics. It means you get more chances at exotics, and that chance is already exceedingly low. You can play for weeks on end and never see a world drop, the correlation to play time is directly related to drop chance which is minuscule. And THEN you only have a chance at getting an exotic you don‚Äôt already have, nevertheless one you want. Of all the things to be elitist about, luck is one of the stupidest.
---
Walks outside, is immediately shot by police
---
Because with master of arms headshots do 20% more damage, and bodyshots are made to do the same damage which means bodyshots get a huge buff.
---
With the change the body shots will only get 20% more damage just like headshots. Which is less than rampage x3.
---
What do you mean? What part of destiny is pay to win?
---
Yeah I'm for sure going to buy all his exotics first so the fated won't be anything he sells
---
And now the babybitch crybabies will move onto the next thing that mildly annoys them.
---
Thank you. Just finished it. Finally
---
Then yeah just good luck at the very least you have to wait 4 weeks if you have perfect luck and each planet gets the flashpoint in a row if its on mars like it is this week then youre out of luck that week. Easier when the game came out cause those were the only 4 planets so it happened pretty consistently
---
Oh and the huntef exotic hes selling you know ophidia sphate
---
I got my third one yesterdayüò†
---
Never needed to use it myself
---
I'm thinking he's just showing us his insanely impressive cosplay prop, not putting on a clinic on how to operate firearms. 
---
It ain't that serious.
---
I only hear that on PC and I‚Äôve been playing d2 console since launched and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen over 10 people using TLW besides me. Someone always complaining
---
it is
---
I would actually disagree with the other comment on their usefulness. In PvP they fulfill the same role as a shotgun but require power ammo so you wont be able to use them as often. In PvE they simply don't do enough damage to be better than any other power weapon option, plus you'll find most bosses (what you want to be using your power ammo on) have what's called a "boop" attack that is an AoE centered on themself they use whenever someone gets in melee range. These attacks have massive knockback, flinging you way out of range of your sword and often to your death if you go off a ledge or are slammed into a wall. So in many people's opinion the risk is unfortunately not worth the reward when you can just use a machine gun, grenade launcher, or rocket launcher.
---
Dio?
---
^yes
---
Oh gotcha. I've only been back on d2 after dropping it after warmind so idk all the changes
---
Yeah. For the most part, my loadout consists of Lucky Pants/Oathkeepers and a handcannon with a lot of handling.
---
Titans, OEM, Insurmountable, Peregrine, or DFP with any weapons 
---
Warlocks with Transversives or wings.
---
I play every class, so I get to see these exotics from every perspective because of this.
---
That was hilarious ingame
---
Vessel of Oryx is hella dope, gj and thanks for sharing
---
You're right, but I can still be irked by it :p
---
Yeah that‚Äôs where my disconnect is. I only play a hunter, so I have a very defined play style because of it.
---
Damn. I missed it
---
Uncle Drifter
---
I've found that green blocks tends to be more common when using a white/purple brick weapon. Try that, I suppose.
---
i mean ill take the sentinel helmet
---
I see.
---
I wish they weren't nerfing Recluse in PvE :(
---
Nice I need to go get one
---
ORA!
---
Now hang on, it depend on whether he plays more PvE or PvP. Resilience is very important in PvP as that measly 10% changes the TTK for many guns.
---
for pve? very different weapons. one is boss dps and one is ad clear.
---
Happens with all weapons. Killing tally with 21%, rampage, kill clip, etc.
---
Probably die a lot, I'd guess.
---
Quitting is for fuckin' losers.
---
Super is an almighty peck, 1 shots all uldren sov looking awoken in the vicinity
---
Such a let down. Never played/cared less of the game in years...
---
Sad to see it nerfed and fall to shambles !
---
oem should reduce damage while running with shoulder charge
---
Contraverse Hold + Warlock handheld supernova
---
1000 glimmer dressing
---
Awesome!
---
Well this is bad butvits even worse with perks that require a sort of charge up like the tarrabahs perk
---
They did a switcheroo
---
They probably won't because they would be too worried about Disney claiming it looks too much like mandalorian helmets.
---
Irony there is that Mandalorians are heavily based off sparta and that includes their helmets.
---
I got a few days ago. Used to complete the Vex Offensive SMG triumphs and the Gambit SMG kills. 
---
It did it's job. It will now retire on console. XD
---
At 2am MST it would be 5pm in China. Sooooo tough luck.
---
The armor back in d1 was amazing. It reminds me of a [mandolorian helmet](https://imgur.com/gallery/JFNLJ/comment/1196819027)
---
Ignore it, Ace + erianas vow are a joke. Would much rather have this guy than an OEM recluse mountaintop Titan.
---
Fuck snitches.
---
That's fair!
---
D1 thing
---
Spectrum, colour of oryx
---
Random only from the servitor that the malfeasance quest dropped from
---
This is amazing!
---
yeah idk why everyone is saying it‚Äôs done. will still be a very good helmet

Reading is hard

That's mk 44 stand asides.
---
Yeah same here, I wanted to cry
---
Sadly, but it was fun will it lasted
---
lol yeah double k.o's are pretty common
---
Seriously fighting lion is easily the second best single shot nade launcher in the game. Not quite as strong as MT but the fact you choose when it blows makes it super versatile
---
I thought it said "Dark Cows" at first.
---
Hopefully but lunas howl has sort of gotten better I think
---
Got me:D
---
But. Your a titan this is your main weapon.
---
Jk
---
Just the first mission in which Eris saves you.
---
You need full shadowkeep for Nightmare hunt pinnacle.
---
I guess so but console players could get screwed over
---
Congratulations, you are the 1 millionth person to find and post it
---
I didn't think I would get hooked myself...now I emote in game now.... thought it was stupid when I first saw it... my hour count is higher than my time with my wife in a week... lol :)
---
Zoom, wait for the buff, shoot
---
Some console players could be stuff tho
---
lol so that is what it is. [Bungie.net](https://Bungie.net) is doing maintenance.
---
Ok bye. We'll try to miss ya.
---
Then why are you here?
---
Sorry if I touched a nerve, I didn‚Äôt here anything about it so didn‚Äôt know
---
Ok boomer
---
That's hot. Oof.
---
Remember when the US had the Prohibition? That didn‚Äôt end well.
---
Tfw you‚Äôre a Chinese alcoholic and you rely on five hours of video games as a hobby to keep you sober and then China announces this.

Or does this ban only apply to children and not adults? If that‚Äôs the case then China just said ‚Äúscrew you, Chinese parents! We know better than you.‚Äù

dim beta is way better than the normal version

Remember when we used to get new iron banner guns? Rip
---
Well it‚Äôs bungee what can I say?

Losers will cry about whatever they get killed by.  Which is why their opinions should never effect the sandbox.  Learn how to counter and stop gear blaming.
---
Storm trooper helmet please bungie
---
Yeah this is a sad time for people like us
---
That was the fastest [removed] in the west. Wow.
---
Blur out everyone else's names.
---
Anyone else find it troubling that Bungie‚Äôs record with nerfs is so bad that we‚Äôve all made the assumption that OEM is going to nerfed to oblivion and left unused?
---
Please continue making art.
---
Ohh, got it... hahaha
---
Yeah hunters who never play anything else shouldnt cry about titans on any platform... because you dont know how extremely annoying it is playing against invisible little pricks that flippidy flop all over the place (hunters) haha ;)
---
Feel sorry for you mine but I guess bungee can‚Äôt seem to do anything right. It‚Äôs meant to be a good weapon because it a pinnacle weapons
---
Pc
---
My Titan uses Khepri's Horn, because Warlock mains like to put in work for our kills.
---
I hope to!
---
Should start using "NASTY" instead of disgusting.
---
omg amazing
---
Yeah headshots in pve are easy but pvp for some console players will be a challenge of some sort
---
That‚Äôs rough, buddy.
---
I‚Äôm a Titan and I join in on the maniacal laughter! (Actium Sweetbiz combo) üòèüëåüèº

Feels bad man

Hm, I didn't know that, tnx

Yeah bungie do that

Poor Titans?! Fuck OEM /s

You get the catalyst for completing heroic mode whisper (launched from the Io map). You can progress the catalyst by completing heroic mode whisper, and gain bonus progress by finding hidden chests inside the mission. You can gain catalyst progress once per account per week, so at minimum it takes 3 weeks to complete it.
---
Add a backup mag to that 21% and you will fall in love with the thing.  Absolutely one of the best weapons in the game if you get a lot of power bricks.  Never reload, never lose x3 Tally
---
WHERE‚ÄôS SYLOK YOU HEATHEN
---
Ya they seem to roll quite often for me...
---
That‚Äôs amazing, what did you use to make it?
---
Just making a point here, you do not need a bunch of raid experience to become a Sherpa. 
---
The Sherpa who taught me(formerly a completely clueless blueberry) vault of glass, only had 1/2/3 clears of the vault of glass raid. We had a blast as we struggled through the encounters, and wiped countless times. 
---
You do want to have a decent understanding of the raid to be successful(which any good quality raid guide studied will teach all you need to know), but the main parts of being a Sherpa is patience, a positive encouraging attitude, and a willingness to step up and lead the team making callouts. Being able to adapt to the circumstances, and perhaps move people around,  or change strategies is another skill that can be honed to make a Sherpa more effective.
---
Being a Sherpa more than anything just requires you willing to help others. That's it. Little experience or much experience doesn't really matter. All it does is improve your abilities and makes you more effective.
---
For a game plan you should try to learn the content you want to Sherpa in, and get practice doing each and every role, so you have a complete understanding of how everything works, to better help students. You don't need to know everything, just be confident in what you do know. If you are on PC, I can teach you everything you need to know in whatever raids/content you want to learn. If not on PC, I can still help you with advice if you like.
---
Mistakes are as very good thing in learning, because they teach you the limits and boundaries of the mechanics, and help you identify what is crucial, what isn't.
---
Anyways, go for it, you can do it! The more you Sherpa  the better you will get!
---
If anyone else reading this comment is interested in becoming a Sherpa and on PC, message me and I can teach you all you need to know, and help you learn raids fully(whether you have some or none experience)
---
That's strange, I've survived with the cap 7 out of 7 times while going for flawless. Either I got really lucky or there are other factors at play.
---
Seriously, the amount of people ready to cheat on their faithful vanguard is kind of sad.
---
Move sideways 3 meters, or behind cover and it‚Äôs useless
---
That's it! I'm grabbing me Burning Maul!
---
This is unreal good dude. Thank you for making this!!!
---
As did I
---
you don't need to grind the activity just wear a mask around.  With normal play you should have enough to stop by before weekly reset and empty whatever you have to Eva for bags and hope for cores/shards/ascendant/whatever you need.
---
Thx
---
I love how shotgun OEM users are referred to as apes and the racism of the movie makes it seem like there‚Äôs levels to this meme
---
What is the reason? Can't be poor connection.
---
report them for hacking
---
I will now do this all the time.
---
Also I respect your choice of a bow my good sir.
---
Jokes on you, I prefer Dunemarchers !
---
Bullpup design, more then likely a banana clip and a easy grab on the bottom to blend with rifle
---
Oh well good luck

For‚Äùconsistent poor connect effecting the play of others‚Äù

Load into a game until you see ‚Äúsearching for guardians‚Äù or whatever pops up then back out. Sometimes it just takes loading up another game search to give it to you
---
Reinstance
---
Thank you!!
---
I already explained myself in my comments. And you must not play this game or any game enough if you don‚Äôt know what that means. Look it up.
---
3 of the playlists are basically just control !!!!!!!!!
---
Yeah, hope they will include it the next season
---
Betternet
---
Okay bye then fella. I guess you dont get the thing about Options or the fact that OP asked about Coldheart or Prometheus. 
---
You basically pulled all this outa thin air and made it ur weird little mission to try and discredit something you already said you never used.
---
It starts health regen, given the time, depending on your recovery stat, it WILL fill up to full fairly quickly
---
No? There‚Äôs control and there‚Äôs momentum control. That‚Äôs really it and those two are played COMPLETELY differently. You don‚Äôt have to play control bruh play smth else like the free for all mode or elimination or survival bruh stop bitching
---
if only queenbreaker was good and a special weapon...
---
There‚Äôs still a year of content basically that will be coming out. Way too early to tell
---
You are so pretentious.
---
RN, yes sunshot, graviton, huckleberry, riskrunner  can and will outperform recluse, I seen it happen and did it, but other legendaries just suck tbh, even without recluse
---
For example, Monte Carlo, Cerberus and sweet business are way better then any other auto, I only use reckless oracle and gnawing hunger due to artifact mods
---
Someone who got a bingo apparently. (Actually wall of wishes for the shadowkeep raid)
---
Yea but most of the time cqc comes down to point blank shotgunning. Swords in special slots also lot you three peek round corners and delete people who want to rush you. Shotguns will still be present but swords would probably replace those for a majority of players. Also swords don‚Äôt require as much skill as shotguns.
---
Or you can do some research on the game you love so much. Instead of being lazy.
---
Guffaws in mask of the quite one
---
Thank you!
---
*cough* Riskrunner *cough*
---
It‚Äôs uldren sov wearing an Eva Levante mask?
---
How you primarily play pvp and don‚Äôt know what SBMM is ?
---
Aw shit I gotta grind this weekend for mountain top then
---
How do you figure? This is truth.
---
I'm explaining why coldheart is not an option *fella*
---
Prometheus lens is good at what it does
---
Coldheart is not, like at all
---
I know but their emblems and their power levels and all the info. A clan admin or founder should be able to see these in game.
---
I'm new and don't really notice it that much, other than when I'm marking something at the very top of the map
---
Uh, I'm pretty sure pvp has nothing to do with pve nerfs. Bungie wants pve to be challenging. Which is why there were so many changes coming into shadowkeep. Nerfed infinite supers, damage perks etc. You can blame pvp players all you want but it doesn't make it remotely true.
---
Yeah... I fell for the Fighting Lion meme for exactly 1 game. I quickly realized that guns sucks big ass.
---
You were the one that brought them up. Yes, matchmaking isn't perfect but if you're good enough, you can still win.
---
My warlock exo is shorter than Eva üò¢
---
They buried me in the sand and forgot me
---
Yes. Bungie.net is down for emergency maintenance!
---
Max Melee build and wormgod caress with one two punch. Insta kill a striker at x3

He ain't coming back for Destiny 3.

If I looked this epic all the time, my helmet would stay on, too.

Your saying it as if what your saying is 100 percent factual what platform do you play you sound like a toxic Xbox fuck boy
---
*"I have made contact with the Rebels and all is proceeding as you wished, Darth Vader."*
---
Where would I go if I wanted to tell bungie about a possible bug?
---
Hold on, why ALL new light players? They aren't all hackers, majority of them are really good people getting into the game now that its free and not paid. The new light players are not the issue.
---
Wow
---
Fingers crossed, all we can do is hope.
---
Exactly. You could have just responded with what that acronym is but you‚Äôd rather me google it myself to make you feel better about your self. Literally the definition of pretentious? You think you are smart and not lazy for knowing gaming terms??? Are you serious ? What are your priorities ? Stop commenting on my post or have a reasonable discussion about the topic I posted on.
---
Have you *seen* the og Gambit sets?
---
I hope it's this. In reality, I hope she offers something useful for all this frigging candy
---
It used to hurt double when an OEM titan kills me, a titan main. Now it will hurt less. 
---
also

laughs in doom fangs and cap‚Äôs shield!

There are a lot of companion apps (like destiny item manager) that allow you to move weapons to different characters without having to fly to the tower and manually go to the vault

THANK YOU! CAPTAIN AMERICA ALL THE WAY!

Maybe he was intentionally pew pewing

If they just listen to the community, it'll just become a hunter meta. Lol

Laughs in 111 Ammo Sturm

And 4.4x multiplier for precision when fully charged instead of 3.3x

._. Most people just say the acronym. And as I said dude if you play pvp as much as you said you would know what it is. And I commented on your question. You asked more questions about my response and I answered and your mad about that? Lol.
---
You want to go to prison?

I  wouldn't say top tree throwing knife is, pretty useful tbh, but bottom tree is. It does 130 on crits and 100 to the body, not really that good when you think about how tempest strike does 130 already.
---
I hope they buff it so that its 150 to the head and 130 to the body. That way you can throwing knife to the body and then crit with a 140/150/110, or you can crit with a 180 and throwing knife to the head.
---
Also, shoulder charge isn't really good for securing kills. You'll get to a certain point where you realize that a good player will always position well enough that trying to shoulder charge is a bad idea. Amazing for its added movement for titans though.
