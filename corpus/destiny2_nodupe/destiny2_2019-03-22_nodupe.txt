Error should be netural since it affects all

skull is not balanced in activities like these

and i fucking love it

This totally reminded me of Zelda Majora’s Mask
---
Sucks cause I'm garbage at crucible....
---
No new raid?
---
Like, for the first time ever since Forsaken I saw someone with fully masterworked *armor* yesterday. I’m amazed there isn’t even a discussion of how pointless masterworked armor is. Like, it should give or upgrade enhanced perks to make them even more effective, not like 2 or 3 perfect more resistance to an element. 
---
That's a good one, can't believe I forgot that. 
---
Take it away Ikora!
---
...
---
Subtle. Bring it back!
---
THIS IS AMAZING!!!
---
Fucking incredible hahahahahhaha
---
I even forget about SotP
---
Real talk: Why are all of the other species only males? There’s some hive wizards and Riven but I mean basic enemies.
---
The whole theme of the end of forsaken was us giving into hatred and not sparing Uldren. Zavala told us there would be consequences "maybe not now, but someday" 
---
I think Uldren will probably be demonized and convince some of the awoken to fight the Guardians
---
Looks cool, I may have to draw one myself. 
---
On a side note I just got this exotic last night so take my relatable upvote! 
---
I would actually use this
---
Meh I’d give anything for them to bring back something like the Mantle of Efrideet.

Double Valor
---
Also there's at least one canon female Knight, and D1 has a few references to Fallen females. With Cabal... I have no idea.
---
The last post by bungie recorded 68% of destiny community has logged more hours as hunters then ANY of the other classes
---
There's a hand cannon called Annual Skate that you can get from Sloane's engrams. People seem to like it, but I don't know exactly what makes it good. 
---
If you like 110 rpm hand cannons, you could try farming the [Thin Line](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1178886909/thin-line/). It has a very slow base reload speed, so you will want one with some sort of reload increasing perk. Rampage can be good, but you have a relatively short time frame before rampage runs out after a kill. 
---
I could not tell you which one is "best." That is all up to personal preference, in my opinion. 
---
Whats the armor pieces on your hunter. All those accounts look amazing!
---
You can get one by beating the first encounter of Last Wish, or You get one from using the Oracle at the week where you get to visit Mara Sov. Hope this helps
---
Parcel of Stardust, Breakneck, just to name a few. 
---
That's Malfeasance
---
I could also argue that an invisible space ninja with a shit ton of heath doesn’t need any longer super time(gwisin), or that a giant handheld ball of doom doesn’t need to be given back to the user instantly (skull of d.a.). I could go on. None of them really neeeeed help, but it’s fun to have an upgrade on an already powerful ability. 
---
Yaaaas
---
Where is literally anything not a hand cannon
---
From the chest you open during curse week in the dreaming city. The chest from consuming your offering to the Oracle I mean.
---
It was announced in the destiny 1 roadmap.... i think bungie decided not to release it for umm reasons
---
[Roadmap](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/72/cb/d7/72cbd74bc9310b6e837a5bd1df224d65.jpg) 
---
Yeeeeeah but it’s definitely more focused on the lower tree, since you get more damage.
---
Not really. I was just showing off the ornament anyway, don't really care what anyone thinks of the gun.
---
Monochromatic? 
---
Oh wow how did I forget breakneck and is parcel of stardust really good? I tend to use ikelos and want the dust rock blues
---
Definitely 
---
How do I know if it’s curse week?
---
You can wipe an entire team with lunas? Please tell us more of these stories, are the opponents blind and playing with their feet by any chance?
---
Also thing you say about the perk is nonsensical, did you misread the perk maybe? 
---
Many cabal are female and even some helped take down calus
---
Shit, for once Warlock has objectively the best armor
---
Can't you pull it from collections?
---
It kind of worked too. Lol. 
---
I guess. But whenever I'm getting beaned from across the map by a titan shield or gunned down by a flaming sword or one-shot by a golden gun or wiped by a tracking nova bomb from around a corner the last thing I'm thinking is how much worse spectral blades is. They all suck to fight against, it's weird that everyone singles that one out. 
---
Petra is at Rheasilvia when it's full curse
---
Would make getting this ruddy exotic quest done a little easier.
---
I got a seed of light from heroic blind well.
---
Rare drop on Blind Well.
---
That’s way more entertaining than the tryhards.
---
Join us we get free gear and the 4 different medals for the synthesizer for evry week I believe 
---
I don't know which seeds you've already gotten, so I'll just say how to get all the seeds. 
---
* Random drop from blind well tiers 2, 3, and 4. 
---
* Guaranteed drop from defeating Kalli, the first boss of the Last Wish raid. 
---
* Guaranteed drop from giving an offering to the oracle during the third week of the Dreaming City's three week cycle. 
---
To tell which curse week it is, look at the Dreaming City. [Here is an album of screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/U3CvlXm) comparing the first and third weeks. If you don't want to physically travel there, look at where Petra is. It will also say which week in super tiny print at the top of the weekly reset infographic stickied to this subreddit every week. 
---
The Strand: First, least cursed week
---
Divalian Mists: Second, middle week
---
Rheasilvia: Third, most cursed week.
---
Thanks a bunch :)
---
Thank you!
---
*big yikes*
---
The posd is very good to tbh
---
The fighting lion is best meme
---
He didn't use to do that, he would only say when you had enough motes to summon a primeval, you had to watch the other players and pay attention to figure it out. I guess not enough people did figure it out so they added the screaming instructions. 
---
Ok. Any ult can one shot spectral blade BUT you need 2-3(999) hits to kill any ult. Is that fair? No
---
I got one from the forsaken storyline and one from the blind well tier 4 
---
Parcel of Stardust is a Lightweight Shotgun, so you can get your sanic on. Plus in Gambit Leather it looks like something you stole from DooM. It can roll with damn near anything. I had a 'god roll' one with Accuraized Rounds, Full Choke, Slideshot and snapshot sights. Add in a sprint grip and it was a _dirty_ mankiller in Crucible.
---
Anyone else fucking tired of this repost? We get it. Boys are pathetic creatures and like boobs.  
---
Question's been answered thanks to /u/Hatherence, so wrapping this thread up with a lock. Thanks for the help!
---
We need more people like you, Guardian.
---
So these are the people complaining about crucible steps in quests. It makes so much more sense
---
I like Tiesto.
---
Its genetics man
---
Just in case you havn't noticed since you're 560, Drifter has these new Power Surge bounties that award 640 light gear.
---
Tether and birthright or colony. Also wait for doubles and get a buddy to help farm

“I think only players bad at crucible should play crucible so I can feel better about myself”

Yeh i fucked up pretty hard

I used shards to buy cores

Thanks for noticing! I edited this in the post, meant to put 650!
---
Make sure everyone who keeps saying titans are weak and not good in pve see this.  Titans good! 
---
"Heroic Strike"
---
Yea me to because it not fair if i don't win. 
---
What's a prismatic thingy
---
I'm afraid your words are just gibberish to me. 
---
That's tier 2, they are talking about tier 3.  You can't even enter matchmaking for tier 3 until 680
---
Soloing this seems to be the way to go.
---
Took you under 45 minutes meanwhile another guy on here spent 8 hours wiping with randoms because they didn't want to look up strats.
---
It's just your opinion, all supers have their place.  You just have to  know what counters them.
---
But he is.
---
why would they even bother giving you one revive? unless you’re a D1 Warlock, that’s 100% not happening
---
Can't kill more without more enemies on the map
---
Thanks
---
That is what it says, "bounties that can be purchased **for** gunsmith materials." 
---
Like the dude above me said , run the hollowed lair over and over with main ingredient while using your characters arc subclass. Make sure you have a special ammo finder perk in your armor. Just kill as many adds as possible especially the ones in the boss encounter. I grinded and for mine in a day... TOTALLY WORTH IT. It’s the only energy weapon I use nowadays and shreds in gambit.
---
The last word is fine, just got all my thorn kills using it today. 
---
[Here’s a video showing it.](https://youtu.be/yIN3FYmjOA4)

Yea just having a bad day it seems like

One is One Thousand Voices.

As a warlock main all I have to say is ew
---
Wtf happened to ikoras face in the third frame?
---
*insert weak excuse about English not being my native language here*

That’s exactly how I got the savathun song done for thorn!
---
This dude put Bergusian Night on Whisper lol
---
Hat the hell is going on? Someone please explain 
---
I read it as  you a real one lmao 
---
It's cuz we lost our Vangaurd
---
That’s the funniest way I’ve seen someone call others in 2019 XDDD 
---
Is English your first language? Because it is actually quite clear. Powerful means to gave great power or strength. 
---
when its not 1920 by 1080. 
---
Interesting indeed and can’t wait till we learn more
---
Is that... Destiny's Child?
---
Name checks out
---
Another question, is the some sort of raid Id coldown like in world of warcraft? 
---
like?
---
Beginner's luck is one hell of a drug
---
Take em out of infusion and let us enhance perks with em, I hate that the only sets I can find enhanced perks on is raid, DC, and gambit prime armor.
---
But the dot doesn't delay the heal and over shield the oem provides a Titan after a kill. Me and another teammate were hitting this Titan and I was using thorn. The dot disappeared as soon as the Titan killed my teammate.
---
I think it's about 50 enemies or so
---
You can only raid with other PC players, as the other person said the destiny app can help you find a team or you can use discord. 
---
Not sure what you mean by this but each character you have can get one drop per encounter per week. 
---
I don't use them. But I have noticed this shit. Really irritating. At least for the moment its a constant 2 swaps per prism change. Still not satisfying.
---
lets be honest, Nova Warp was never as fun as Bomb with Skull in PvE. Rip voidlocks in crucible though :(
---
The hunter has a bigger shoulder piece than the titan? OP please nerf.
---
Havent seen or heard about glitched lobbies. So far all I have heard about are:
---
Actual DDOSers(aka internet completely dies)  
---
People manipulating matchmaking loading indefinitely until enough players quit, or all have gone and they choose to start it.
---
People manipulating matchmaking to trade wins by only matching against each other, and/or queue dodging each other.
---
People missing on spawn in and not existing on any tracking site in post match, is because of queue dodgers.
---
If this exists, as far as I know it would have to be something new. Didnt see a whiff of it on any LFG site, just a couple streamers offering carries. If you have a link, or screenshot to prove this is the case I would definitely be interested to learn of it.
---
Either way without more information, none of us can rule out a natural DC for the OP, unless he has additional evidence(game history of his opponents have lots of DCs, etc)
---
  
---
Spectral blade took all the shield gunslinger should have. Take some from one and make both balanced.
---
I rarely masterwork anything now. It doesn't seem to make that much of a difference anyway. I haven't masterworked a single Y2 armor piece since masterworking a few early on, and seeing no tangible difference in DR. I throw all the Vanguard and Eververse sets in the Vault and forget about them because it feels like a waste of cores to infuse them. I used to want to look good, but now I don't care. It's too much work. Just like real life.  
---
And for some weapons that suck at multi-kills - it's totally useless to masterwork or infuse them. I find myself only masterworking certain weapons because I know they will be orb machines. That's it. There's no feeling of achievement after doing that either. Now I just run around looking like a scrub with "meh" roll weapons and am happy if I even get a 3/4 roll. This feels like a huge regression.
---
U need to do the triumph. ‘Call me... Sentry’
---
Thank you thank you but if I have to farm to get all the gear for the badges again I’ll cry robot tears
---
Nice one. But the new even in asterisks is unnecessary. sentinels rocked that stage forever. You can kill the whole add spawn by punching one enemy with the sentinel. It spreads and then all 20-30 die.
---
You won’t, like the people before me said your accolades and achievements are account wide 
---
This post gets me every time.

I guess someone needs to learn about patience. 
---
Oh my
---
Disclaimer: Different person here, I cannot speak for everyone, these are just my opinions. 
---
* Invasion kills heal the primevals far too much, leading to EXTREMELY long drawn out matches if the two teams' invaders both get army of ones consistently. I think it would be better if primevals healed less the more damage phases you went through, just to prevent preposterously long matches where one team damages the primeval, enemy invades, wipes team, fully heals primeval. Enemy team damages primeval, person invades, heals enemy primeval fully. Rinse and repeat maybe 5 or 6 times. Granted, this does not happen EVERY match, but it happens often enough that I think it is annoying. 
---
* Loot drops are sparse enough that it is perfectly possible to have everything for hte Dredgen title except some random gun. Or you may only get one or two of a specific gun. This is only amplified with Gambit Prime. I have had *one* prime weapon drop so far since release, across all my gambit prime and reckoning runs, while a clanmate I played most of it with has had more than 5 drop. This is an RNG-heavy game, but given that gambit prime weapons have random rolls, giving them low drop rates on top of that does not make it rewarding enough, I feel. 
---
* The Sentry set perks are extremely underwhelming. The top one, the one that is supposed to be really cool and hard to attain, is laughably useless. It gives maximum mobility, resilience, and recovery to everyone standing inside the light during primeval damage phases. Mobility increases walk/strafe speed and jump height, which is of limited usefulness in such a small area. Resilience gives you more hp, but it is an incredibly small difference overall. Recovery is the one that makes the biggest difference, but because of that, anyone who cares to will have a high recovery set of armor on in the first place. 
---
Same on pc for Gambit and crucible comp. 
---
Oh Uldren's definitely gonna get backlash when he shows up at the Tower, but I doubt that outcome will happen. Not only because the Reefborn are fanatically loyal to Mara *and only Mara*, but because even if he does (and he probably will) learn of his connection to her and the Reefborn, he'll no longer have that emotional connection due to losing his memories. Basically, just "I'm told I was important to to guys" wouldn't work as real motivation, nor a convincing argument to rally people with him.
---
Anyway I got kinda carried away but to be honest the Awoken aren't really in any place to attack the only people keeping the Hive from completely taking their city, even if they wanted to. 
---
Hmm ok, but did this work for you. I mean do you have progress there? I play Nova Bomb Warlock most of the time and I think its very unlikely that I never killed 12 enemies with it. I would be shocked if I didnt.
---

Perhaps Solstice Armor with random perks will be at end of Y2 :/ But for 100% it will looks default

Discord is a popular program used for voice and text chat by video game communities. On desktop, you will see the discord icon in the upper right hand corner of this subreddit, which will bring you to this subreddit's discord server (a group for people in this subreddit to join if they wish). 
---
I feel like mostly PC players use discord, but it might just be because I am a PC player, so I notice PC players more. You may want to try /r/fireteams or the built in xbox group finder function.

I've posted this several times before, and each time mention is given to the balance of exotics, I'll be here to post it again (and keep it updated)
---
Agreed. But what about strenght of the pack from D1? By far the coolest cloak ever IMO
---
Only a few inputs because i honestly don't have the patience to reply to all of them
---
Crest of alpha lupi: this would either be completely useless because of too low healing or a healing rift with a shield, which would probably be broken.
---
St0mp-ee5: please no, this would be a stealth buff to shotguns and they are still on the strong side of weapons, even after the nerf
---
The stag: this would make your teammates say 'thank you' when you die. It encourages death, thus bad gameplay.
---
Geomag: this is a prime example of an exotic that does a good job. It makes chaos reach really good for dps. It does this job well, it is exotic but you have to adjust your playstyle. I see absolutely no reason to make it affect any other super.
---
These are the ones that immediately stood out to me but i am overall against super strong exotics. They should be strong, yes but if playstyles are changed more drastically by exotics, all it does is make the crucible and even gambit more chaotic
---
Read the description again. Elemental damage reduction is only for PvE
---
Thanks as I only play PvE maybe that's why I had that opinion.
---
I remember before forsaken, I only wore that set. With the Vanguard shiny shader. Lo and behold. a week later its the vanguard set. With that same orange &amp; blue shader. I was so disappointed with that.
---
Regardless, still a great looking set on Titan. Just not close to Ikelos with a frumious blue shader. Or Trials. Damn I want to boot up the game just to look at my sets again. 
---
I think the idea of "just am for the head" is a bit disingenuous as that's all you need to do with most weapons. I personally think Luna's and Not Forgotten are examples of good weapons that require skill to both earn and use. That is in stark contrast to something like Recluse, which seems to be pants on had levels of absurd while requiring much less skill to use effectively. Weapons like that are much more detrimental to the environment, in my opinion.
---
It is known.
---
Is it retroactive to all characters or do I have to reset three times in the same character?
---
I'm relatively new to the game, can someone please explain what's going on here (supers and possibly exotics used)?
---
Ah! yes! I love the new monarchy set. just not the helmet. I remember the grind to get all the ornaments! and the sweet business Catalyst. Oh BOY that was fun.
---
It's supposed to give you damage reduction while you ult. Not sure why they made it a thing, as if regular super resistances weren't cancer enough. But that's what it says it does. And the elemental resist is just for PvE.

Well this is pretty much any PvP game ever. Also it sounds like you are getting frustrated and that's a huge downfall on the Glory grind. Set ground rules. Because once you start losing your cool you also lose your advantage. I always take a break after 2 losses in a row to reset. So far I have solo'd 2100 each of the previous seasons and am around 1600 so far this season all with only being slightly above average (1.5 K/D)
---
I agreed with you completely on that. It's not always a just aim for the head type situation. And yes, recluse is nuts. Can't wait for more people to get that. This sub will be in flames. 
---
Shame they didn't take it down sooner lol could of saved myself a fortune on subpar dlc
---
That's a good idea. And congrats to you! Right now I'm practicing my snipes before I go back in. 
---
Yess I loved that one, definitely top 3. D1 had really cool cloaks in terms of being different and nice looking.
---
&gt; No phone images or videos. 
---
&gt;No loot and "look what I got" posts. 
---
Snipes are pretty good right now, just remember to keep your distance and stay paced. Don't let yourself get pulled into a fight when you can play from range. 
---
At first Comp was very frustrating, but the more I play I actually prefer it to quickplay. Even if I'm losing more often.
---
Gambit prime could be renamed to kill race to first invade. First invade decides the overwhelming majority of games. 
---
Blockers are a tad too tanky considering they drain motes now and usually come alongside an invade. 
---
Invading still takes zero skill. And even if the invader doesn’t get a kill it’s a 30 second game of hide and seek giving the invading team another huge advantage. 
---
I’m not a fan of catch up mechanics but deciding a game within 30 seconds is trash. I have yet to lose a game where we invade first.

From what I have seen Bungie always goes in spurts, great new content then some crazy story stuff then great new content.
---
Right now we are in the "Crazy story stuff" with the drifter lore and The Nine stuff. Next season brings more on Calus and a raid I believe. So we shall see.
---
I personally am excited for a hopefully "D3" (Or similar maybe with a new name flair) on a new engine in next gen where they can actually expand, update, and build on how great the lore and world actually is. Hopefully the Activision split will allow these changes.
---
Source? You guys speak some sort of elvish.
---
It’s not balanced in anything. 3 yellow bars and you get a full super
---
Thanks, I enjoy that 69% is in the preview for the watch face, it makes me smile. 
---
Aha thanks. No nonsense heroic activation for sure 😂 
---
The picture doesn't do it justice. I'm quite proud of this one actually.
---
The little dots on the outside rotate nice and smoothly. I may keep this one for a few weeks. 
---
I am generally in the ballpark of having as many kills as all 3 team mates combined. I also play with very low audio. I am guilty from time to time of not noticing (1/20). But, I like to think I more than make up for the occasional screw up.
---
because they could learn raid and pve is ez but is hard to learn pvp when you are getting shit on every game 
---
i mean the 500 kills are a but cancerous 
---
Post about three max light characters #42978.

Did not new moderators say they will be removing these posts?

i mean the 500 kills are a bit cancerous

Dude, the mags are the last pre-s6 exotic i need. Shed some of that rng on me pls
---
Crown of Tempests is pretty good, but it's really only skul-level broken with grenadier on.
---
No. You have to grind. Grinding is fun. Makes every achievement give you a sense of pride and accomplishment. 
---
Can somebody please explain to me what is happening here?
---
It looks glorious and I'm heading from work shortly to play for the first time in weeks 😂😂
---
Meh, I have it and don't even use it. Dont know if console has ultra aim assist so people think this gun is so good but on PC the glorious quick triple tap is not happening as often. I dont get quick Luna'd that often, tbh.
---
Ace of Spades all the way, babyyy.
---
Literally a fact lol, same RPM, same TTK, except Rampage is more reliable than the DOT 
---
Better than all the booping. Just melee, bro.
---
You need to start following Bungie and BungieHelp on Twitter. They acknowledged the issue on PS4 and even released a statement that it should be fixed. They don’t say if it was a PS4 store issue or a Bungie issue but it has been resolved.
---
Well yeah, but if you're doing a recov you can't just play normally on the acc 24/7
---
Nah, PvP in quests is absolutely fine. I agree that LOSING PROGRESS on it was shitty for TLW for the noobs. There are probably also a few PvP players which dislike having to do PVE endgame for shit (Armory, Raid exotics, yadda yadda)

---
You look like an agile stove
---
You were harder to kill. Watching the clip over and over, it’s obv that if your gear wasn’t masterworked you would have died faster. They hit you with quite a bit scout rifle shots.
---
TIP: if you are going to activate your super, don’t do it standing in the open while already taking damage. You are entering your super with your shield already down. You effectively made yourself into a glass Golden Gun.
---
As a fellow Hunter I can say that blade barrage was extremely pleasing 
---
The game would be much better if they just made scrapper bounties a more consistent drop.
---
Alright alright alright looking good
---
That's your problem. You are missing out 2-6 cores each day.

Who cares, it's fun as a game should be. They better buff other classes with funny things like that ^^

That's actually cracked me up. It's like D2 meets GTA IV, just randomly fucked by something!

---
As a NB Warlock I actually like the risk vs reward factor of it.  
---
Admittedly dying to the one Thrall that 'Get down Mr President' 's its way in front of your super is highly frustrating but it does make you think a little more about the environment or disengage before spamming endless bombs.
---
If Bungie is insistent on keeping this annoying cores around, then stop making me have to use 3 at a time whenever I want to upgrade. 1 core should be enough.
---
Y1 infusion was perfect. I didn't feel like I needed to wait until max level to infuse, but now I do. Which is a problem, because that means the grind to max light is more or less not using the gear you enjoy and instead using what's the highest light. That goes against Bungies stance on why they wanted to introduce ECs in the first place. 
---
Oh and on top of everything, they think *scrapper bounties* are what's on the mind of every player *as a negative*? Fuck, I enjoy scrapper bounties because they give me another way to actually ***get these damn cores. *** And now you want to take them away and replace them with other bounties that I'm going to have to buy?
---
I don't think they're paying enough attention to the conversation surrounding enhancement cores. I think they're being stubborn and instead of removing them from the game and admitting they made progression more annoying than enjoyable and meaningful, they'd rather try and fix a broken system by using broken solutions.
---
The bounties that they're going to introduce would be nice if they gave you two or three per bounty, but a single core as a reward just replaces scrapper bounties at a 1:1 ratio. Unless it guarantees I have access to more of these bounties than scrappers during any given week, I don't see the point in this change. 
---
Not everyone can get a team to do it every week and going in with randoms is the same as solo queue in comp, you don't know if the guys from lfg or reddit are any good and they might leave after someone messes up once. Some people have issues with remembering mechanics and generally, doing raids isn't exactly 'easy'.
---
Bwahahahahahaha! This is what I love most in destiny. The power trip. 
---
In the edz, somewhere in the middle I think.
---
It's godlike in PvE i love it.
---
I get that, I just think there should be a *little* more close-quarters viability and reliability when it comes to NB depending on the situation
---
Downvote forehead 
---
Make sure you are wearing armor that has perks for hand cannons, preferably enhanced.  I do not have Lunas yet but going in with the best loadout I could do has helped a lot.  Now I just need to find a group that works well with my play style.
---
Hydra: *I'm about to end this man whole career.*
---
The one from last wish raid weapons.
---
go through your vault and dismantle everything with bad rolls on it! Got me from 35 to around 500. And I'm still not fully done I think
---
Lunas is worse
---
I like Orimunds Anvil though because I find it to be pretty accurate with a good rate of fire. I'll definitely give Suros Regime a shot though. 
---
Makes me want to play D2 again...but then I think of it for a few seconds and mentally kick myself in the nads and hate myself for even thinking that...game was fun for a few months...then monotony set in. 
---
I want hand cannon, pulse and machine gun frame. That would be fantastic
---
I noticed the little pillar in the middle with a flame has a lot of health too and the aim assist on the enemies inside end up protecting it indirectly. I usually end up killing the boss before it goes down.
---
*omae wa*
---
Just a public event 
---
Shoulder slam into a slide... every time. It's fine I only had 9 motes anyways.
---
Damn, I’ll aim for full on next time 
---
I want PvP maps with vehicles
---
 I could have sworn this was going to turn into one of those “Hey, you’re finally awake” Skyrim videos 
---
Good luck out there! Just remember to play to whatever build you're rocking.
---
I play overly aggressive in qp because it is more fun than laning. 😬 gets me killed more often than not, but I always like to see what I can pull off. 
---
So my loadout on my warlock, since it is the only one I remember right now. (I'm at work, but it is slow lol). I have a 9/2/4 build on my warlock. Transversive steps because I AM SPEED. 
---
I swap between TLW/my almost max range mindbenders with range MW and icarus grip/sword or chaperone/LH or the hero's burden (IB smg, mad range on if it you have a chance to try it)/sword. I don't pick up heavy that often so I always have a sword to peak 3rd person before I engage. Better than emoting as it doesn't let the enemy know you're using 3rd person.
---
I was gonna shorten it but when the clip naturally started on that I thought nah I’ll keep that in it’s quite satisfying haha
---
Sounds great, always stik to what you know best. But if you really want to be *that guy* in crusible get skullfort and a shot gun and follow these steps
---
Shoulder charge&gt;shotgun&gt; regular melee
---
With the iron sights intact please
---
Enhancement Cores could be left, as-is, for Masterwork items and just remove it from Infusion!
---
Lol sounds good I'll give it a try!
---
Wrong dodge
---
The problem is not us who grind the game for hours at a time and stockpile cores, the outcry is for the people that don't have time to do so. Just because we have enough time to keep our cores up doesn't mean they should ignore the pain point.
---
Exactly. People who won't even be able to attain or use the gun whine because of it.
---
Good point actually. In the end, there's always room for improvement. 
---
I wanted to delete mars off the director after I received wayfarer. 
---
Blade barrage user confirmed 
---
IM GONNA BANK ALL THESE MOTES
---
Hey that's really awesome do you do requests?
---
Just my opinion but I find mobility to be pretty useless on a titan. I run a 1-9-7 or a 1-8-8 and I find it pretty consistent because with high resilience you can survive things that would normally one shot and with high recovery you can get back into the fight faster. 
---
For weapons that’s pretty whatever you’re good with that kills fast but with the current strength of special weapons I would definitely using a sniper, shotgun or fusion rifle. And don’t run double auto rifles, makes your effective kill range mediocre because you won’t be able to out range any scouts or snipers and up close you can’t kill fast enough to stop a shotgun or a handcannon
---
*DEJA VU*
---
Nowadays 9 resilience is must have, which gives u a huge advantage versus shotguns and trending Thorn (chance to avoid a death of double headshot w/ buff)
---
You can't blame a game developer for creating encentives to play all contents of it's game. 
---
This is personal preference and not a design flaw. 
---
They're easy enough to make, so sure. What are you thinking?
---
May I PM you? I had an idea for a while since I got my s3 but never could put it together 
---
It's like complaining about sniper crits with whisper. It's a sniper you're supposed to get crits with it...
---
Sure
---
Usually when I go in to Crucible I  run an auto rifle, shotgun and rocket. I just finished a few things on Titan for some Alkane Dust where I needed solar kills and opted to use Hard Light for it
---
they did the same thing with the first curse in D1 and it was pretty cool.
---
Ahh okay. Well aggressive frame shotguns are really nice rn with the right roll, I’m blanking on the barrel attachment rn but never smoothbore, with slideshot, accurized rounds and maybe moving target?
---
I don't understand why Bungie's creative answer to everything is to add more grind.  I think it's time I explore The Division 2.  Too bad because I really enjoy the gunplay in Destiny, but their insistent on making playing the game a second job makes no sense to me.  
---
i’m kinda sad i actually wanted to see a recluse only seventh column
---
I was in a game of Gambit once, and two times  a cabal drop ship spawned halfway inside the ground right where I was standing (as opposed to up in the air where they are supposed to appear), instantly killing me. The first time was funny, the second time, when I lost like 12 or 13 motes was just super salty.
---
Maybe make a contest and the winning 3 ideas make it in the game?
---
To anyone saying not to have activated it where I did, I am not a fan of wasting a fast draining roaming super. I popped it as soon as I registered it being remotely worth popping. I even got two shots off (which missed lol auto-aim my ass). Yes, I suck as crucible overall compared to some try-hards, I am not afraid to admit it. My point was that GG should not be a glass cannon. It’s completely dumb to have it be when titans are literally immune to anything in any super (with auto aiming range supers).
---
In my opinion, all supers should be literal immune killing machines if that’s the case.
---
True. I never thought of it that way, and I worded it wrong on my part too. I'm basically saying Skull should allow you to survive self-damage more consistently via increased percentage or an overshield, plus any scenarios where you die mid cast, like if you were next to legionaries with shotguns or something like that
---
That would be cool, as long as that exotic isn't game breaking
---
Well the contest would be judged by Bungie to ensure they would be balanced.
---
Zhallosupercell is better than Riskrunner 
---
Oh. I think you are 100% not the norm, in that case. I get most of my cores from bounties, and I also do a lot of forging (I have every "kill 500 enemies with this weapon" triumph, the ship from forging 100 weapons, etc.), at least two raids a week, and enough gambit to be halfway to 21% Delirium and only a minuscule fraction of my cores come from there. 
---
So I don't think this is a "casual problem" so much as an anyone who isn't you problem. 
---
It’s only 100 in comp
---
KANSEI DURIFTO ?!
---
I've come up against that first one before. It was a 3 stack against a 4 stack. Match just kept loading. 30 minutes later,  after our random and 1 from our 3 stack left, game finally starts. 2 v 4.
---
Good thing was that it was just clash and we destroyed them. They were garbage.
---
They even had the audacity to ask for a free win because their "friend" was one win from lunas. That match was also the last match i needed for lunas. 
---
Honestly it just comes naturally, for envoys it has to be the final blow, so jotunn if you have it works wonders.
---
The rank reset is obvious, but once you reach legend only wins will count towards infamy, so start stocking up on bounties and saving them until you hit it, it will knock out a good chunk.
---
It even says EMOTE right there
---
You also die if you land on it which is dumb. 
---
You had me confused which subreddit I was in
---
This is so true! LOL
---
"meaningful choices" yeah true, thanks Bungie \^\^
---
Some men just want to watch the world burn. 
---
My first exotic in the game, and I played during HOW. Love this thing
---
I guess I'm in the minority, but just by playing and being a little conservative with level upgrades and masterworks I'm sitting on over 300 cores. They even say in the twab it's meant to curb people from just leveling up every weapon in their arsenal. Also, destiny is a grind--everything in the game is, why would it's basic mechanic of leveling up be any different?
---
Slewper Simulant quest maybe.
---
Why?????. Because when the game first came out a whole lot of disappointment for a game that was granted things easily. “Whaaaa, everything is giving to you”, whaaaaa, to easy, whaaaaaa, there’s no grind, whaaaa make it like D1. 
---
Well now it’s here people. Be careful what you ask for 😂 
---
You should be able to buy atleast raid banners or blind well charges with them. 
---
Awhile back I saw a post of some guy reflecting an entire blade barrage with them and getting like 4-5 kills it was unreal
---
But can they roll enhanced perks now?
---
Well I did discover one cool thing today. If you dismantle/discard 999 of them you can purchase one additional consumables slot.
---
Is there really a ton of "casual" destiny players at this point though? And if so why should they care about being max level?
---
I saw rule 34 in the URL bar and I noped 
---
Agreed. I feel like the intent was to maybe have Petra also work like the dudes on the other planets were you could turn in them for engrams, but they passed on the idea eventually. I base this assumption on the fact that the item has the same wording as the other destination mats. 
---
Either way, I do not pick them up in the wild after I reached my first full stack. I'm close to a second full stack, but I don't spend much time in the Dreaming City anymore.
---
And that’s a problem. Why should infusion be a pain point? It doesn’t add anything of value to the game. N
---
Risky click
---
I’m confused I don’t see a difference 
---
I think there are three groups of people who have trouble with cores: 
---
* People who don't play very much. They log in, do the powerful gear challenges, and log out. Some people say "filthy casuals get out," but I'm the kind of person who wants a variety of people to be able to have fun and enjoy the game. 
---
* People who hate doing bounties for things they weren't already going to do. I think this is the group with the most justified issue, since you can be a hardcore player who has no cores just because you don't do scrapper bounties or spider bounties. Yes, you might get hundreds of cores through normal gameplay, but that doesn't seem to be the norm even among more hardcore players. 
---
* People who think you are supposed to infuse every piece of powerful gear you get. They make their own problem. 
---
ILL BANK AND SUMMON PRIMEVAL
---
Daily enhancement core bounties from the Gunsmith instead of randomly dropping scrapper bounties...
---
Am I crazy or will this actually be a lower daily cap on how many you can get? Because f scrapper bounties drop randomly, there’s theoretically no cap on how many you can get per day. But daily Gunsmith bounties will cap out daily.
---
Uh... tell me I’m missing something. 
---
it’s not destiny 2 related but everyone here should understand 
---
DEJA VU I'VE BEEN HERE IN THIS PLACE BEFORE 
---
STOP! I CAN ONLY GET SO ERECT
---
still one of the best warlock exotics. which one would you prefer?
---
I had to watch it a second time to appreciate it.  I 100% expected this to end with the opening to Skyrim.
---
Drifter literally never calls you just "Guardian". He calls you the Chosen one, sister/brother, Snitch, Dredgen, etc. The only time he calls you any form of "Guardian" is during the Warden of Nothing strike, where he calls you "one of his favorite guardians"
---
Yesterday a clanmate in my crucible fireteam managed to accidentally kill me by launching me at lightspeed into a wall while using spectral blades. Can confirm blades is so OP it kills your own teammates too. Although we were having a competition to get the most kills so it might not have been an 'accident'.
---
Bad bot
---
You’re not wrong most of them are. They’re usually to stop rushers really up close. A good stable one is the antiope. 
---
You’re still ignoring the pain point. It forces most of the player base to “play with the gear from RNG” instead of using what you’ve already grinded for. The system forces me to either use the gear I get from milestones and prime engrams, or use what I want and be under leveled . I’m not speaking for me like I said. I’m 700 on all my characters. I don’t have to deal with the problem, but I see where the problem lies.
---
Yes
---
Only 6? I'm sitting at 9500 of them and counting.
---
Stupid sollect resource bounties....
---
If i rush through i wont get the kills i need though 
---
How does the pertain to destiny 2? And why does it have a fucking video game tag?
---
im still on the void hand cannon thing.  at least it may force me to start chasing the luna quest

Just spam strikes for the fusion kills and when you finish that step go run lake of shadows over and over again.

Thank you :)

Dude literally the grind isn’t even that bad, they are making it more streamlined and reliable. There is so much to do for powerful gear now that getting your light up isn’t hard 
---
The dodge only just came off cool down and I hadn’t noticed
---
Ooo I like that, been working towards a collector set

If you have to play hundreds of hours to get them, then they are rare.

Best pve primary in the game. Helms not too shabby
---
Eh. Keep it, but you can do better.
---
Your on pc aren’t ya 
---
I'm just so excited  for the next invitation 
---
Why is everyone so disgusted with this? I feel like I have plenty of cores and I've ran the same set of armor and weapons since forsaken dropped. That's a lot of infusion.
---
The shaders that cost legendary crystals are cheap so it's more about equipping pieces that you have masterworked. It's a lot cheaper when leveling to just infuse the same pieces and wait til max light to infuse into your best sets. Keep in mind, infusing the same item costs no enhancement cores, only 5000 glimmer, so keep the best version of each item you get. That goes for weapons and armor sets. I try to keep one of each for each new season, so I can save cores and just spend glimmer 
---
This is bullshit. Infusing will never feel like impactful because it's perceived as a largely unnecessary hurdle to actually get to use progress you already made while looking like you already did before. The original system reflected that and then for no reason they drove the prices up.
---
I swear this just happened to me too on EDZ
---
A little louder so Bungie can hear.
---
...did you just call yourself a god?
---
Oh yeah. I actually went back on D1 and did the night fall with a friend. At the end, he got a stack of 3 of coins and I got the stack of strange coins. We both had a good laugh
---
Thank you
---
Initial D was already a meme before that cunt, nothing to do with him
---
1 enhancement core for 50/100 sounds fair 
---
Seriously though, like yo dude I just killed 6 of them in one go WHY ARE YOU INVADING as a sentry! I get it if you have the invader gear 
---
The name was bestowed to me from my Instagram community. My apologies if I offended you.
---
Same.
---
My only problem with cores is that it's hard for new players to get them. There are enough ways to attain them that I was able to stockpile over 100 before Season 6 launched.
---
I love the movie. years ago I would not dream of watching a subbed or dubbed film I actually prefer them more now for better storylines over the same rehashed shit.

I’ve been infusing some on my dreaming city pieces.

I feel you, I had a similar problem with a college router that loaded other games smoothly but couldn’t handle Destiny. I’d maybe look into checking your brothers network settings?

I wish I could find the posts but during Osiris I remember people asking for the RNG to be more cruel and the journey to leveling up longer! If I was the Bungie product manager I would be screaming.

I was crouched down in front of drifter, someone was standing like right on top of me I guess, had to change my underwear after that
---
Doesn’t change the fact that it’s still just a huge pain and benefits nobody. Gonna be quoting the youtube channel Say No To Rage, but there’s literally people who have stopped playing because infusion with cores is such a negative thing. Nobody benefits from cores being in infusion, but everyone benefits from them being removed.  At this point I’m more ranting to get my frustration out than anything else because Bungie already said they’re not going to be taking cores out of infusion (though there’s still a possibility, but considering their current “fix” doesn’t even come until next season, I doubt it). I consider myself a pretty hardcore player, considering I play about 6 to 7 hours every day, but there’s only like 2 ways to get cores on a pretty consistent pace. 
---
Well no shit, why infuse your 650 item into a 658 only to then get a better item that's 660 or 665, you're already behind and you've probably already spent the random cores you had.
---
Competitive was the way to go to try and get thorn for me and my clan mates

I could continue but this or the ones on my mind 
---
No ones asking to upgrade for free, they just want cores removed. Cores were supposed to be used for master working your armor and weapons, but why masterwork armor when you need cores to get it to the highest power?
---
I wonder if it's related to the other bounties not resetting properly and it will turn up on Sunday.
---
Those are the year 1 items you’re talking about right?
---
I think crota's over soul ghost would be cool

---
Fuck everyone who shits on this. What is wrong with you? Just let OP and everyone who feels the same enjoy this. 
---
The problem with Lunas and NF is it creates a ***"the rich get richer"*** kind of thing.
---
Bungie really fucked up putting these guns into the game (because regardless of how you get them, they are OP) and they fucked up even more putting them behind such a high skill/commitment wall.
---
I totally sympathise with the people who sweated balls to get these guns. Because now their achievement is going to be undermined by whatever nerf is coming. 
---
But I also completely sympathise with those who don't have it either. Because that moment where you face a 4-6 stack with these guns, you just feel totally neutered. Because you simply cannot compete in the mid-range. Which forces you into niche playstyles. And guess what? A lot of maps were originally intended for 4v4. I.e. a lot of maps really focus on mid range combat. Going against these guns can really be a nightmare.
---
Now Bungie really shit the bed here. Because whatever they do, they will get a backlash. They have put themselves into a precarious position.
---
I have faith they will think of something though.
---
Hunters really need a new GG exotic. Or maybe some new secondary effect for top tree gunslinger added on to Celestial Nighthawk like they did with rigs. 
---
I remember trying to solo that story version for the malfeasance. Man it was annoying but I did it. 
---
Why so? It’s pretty simple
---
I was disappointing to read the fix is to put them on more boring time killer bounties that are just a chore.
---
Cammy was using nighthawk bottom tree as an anti-super super. 
---
Oh god rampage on GG

Loaded question is from another season so you finished your grind for it. Service revolver is a season 6 pinnacle so you have to grind 40 games THIS NEW SEASON, which started what? Several weeks ago? So it’s only counting your strikes since then.

I have long loading problems for so long now, UI, texture, between area are unbearable. It is worst in some area or mission like I can't use discord push to talk at all at insurrection prime. Turns out all this time, it's because I have DIM open and some I turn it off it's bearable regular load time now. Idk having dim open bottle neck my CPU ram or something else, but I see significant difference
---
This actually came from there but yeah
---
Yes, yes, Guardian, by all means, let's get started.

Hmmm anyone knows if u can retrieve both invites at same time?

Last week I forgot to talk to our on my Titan so if I go talk to him will he give both invites from nine today?

During the dodge you won’t take any damage. You can dodge just before a rocket explodes and avoid being killed

Listen dude, you are litterally the odd man out here. I'm on this page and the forums quite a bit and while I haven't seen ANY posts saying people wanted the enhancement cores completely removed (other then yours) I have seen A LOT of posts about the scarcity of enhancement cores in the game, and that's exactly what bungie is fixing in this next season they will be adding more ways to get cores. Honestly though there are MUCH bigger issues in this game then not being able to level up to max at Mach 10 and be max level in 3 days. I went from 650 on my PC account to 700 in a little over 2 weeks. It really isn't hat hard to do. Now if bungie wanted to fix the fact that there are only 5 destination armors sets with perks out of 20 possible sets, Or the fact that ALL but two of the raid armors don't have perks either. This is content players have paid MONEY for with curse of Osiris and warminds along with all the other armor in the game. Not wanting enhancement cores is just a personal gripe of yours and you need to get over it dude it's part of the game and they aren't going to be removing it. all your math proved was that it takes alot of cores to reach max light. But it's not impossible. Stop bitching cuz after next season starts I'm sure you will be singing a different tune.

PSA: Bungie doesn't do these kind of things. We've been asking for a servitor ghost since solstice of heroes and have yet to get it.
---
We wanted a "Ghost" ghost and didn't get it in the Halloween event. These things don't happen.
---
We already left the raid so i cant do either :(
---
D’oh!

BRING BACK VALGARDE

Now some thrall and add a bit of confused screaming and now we have a deal
