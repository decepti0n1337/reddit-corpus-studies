I've been wayyyy over there. There's not much there. It just seems to continue infinitely. I had gone so far that I could no longer see any lights and it was just very gray.

Too bad people did this 3 months ago. This isn‚Äôt new
---
do you have it without "Destiny 2"  on it?
---
Trials armor for hunter and warlock were the best for sure.

Broooo I‚Äôve been looking for one of those ever sense I saw it in one of their streams

Now we ask why

Got the chest tho

It's been bugged since the 10th. No fix yet
---
Use the Xbox lfg. I can always get people for anything on there.
---
Ive actually not seen a single person complain about it. Im actually only seeing people complain about titans still. Which i never understood.
---
The helmet always stays on.
---
This has happened to me several times
---
I have 4 right now, got Riskrunner asap.
---
 I just got the hunter grips and the other gun from Xur yesterday after BUYING legendary shards with my Glimmer from Spider.
---
Yeah they really should cause with that train of thought sniper mods shouldn‚Äôt affect izanagi
---
The chest only gives armor and a remarkably slim chance at cosmetics, none of the boss-exclusive IKELOS weaponry - which are the highlight of EP.
---
Why not stay ADS the whole time?
---
It looks like the dreadnought
---
Yes, after I created this post, I realized I was stupid and forgot about that
---
Thank you for enjoying it :)
---
If you bought the base game last season it included season of undying ONLY. You have to pay for the others. The deluxe edition included all four.
---
I bought the deluxe version alongside undying
---
Do you know the way?
---
This is the way
---
Spoiler tag pls
---
I have this problem as well. But If you're hunter, top tree nightstalker basically has resource/chest detector. Probably better to have a ghost but I usually run Top tree nightstalker.
---
Just got mine the other day and only 9k away from chalice completion.
---
Season 8 IB but the arms are something else. Something I haven't seen.
---
In the PS store, does the upgrade edition includes season of dawn?
---
Beautiful, just beautiful!

That‚Äôs really good!

Thanks.  Was starting to wonder if I would not be able to get this season's title because of a bug.
---
I'm just getting onto you for getting so mad when no one else was, I could care less about before then, you just blew up suddenly, he was being so calm up until the point you decided to call him a fuckface and overdramatize the situation. "shunning people" no one shunned you they corrected you
---
Okay but you're barking up the wrong tree. Where is anyone else here in the wrong other than Microsoft for following suit. Your complaint isn't with Bungie, or Sony, or Activision even. Its Microsoft for not doing the same for their supporters, because they didn't put that forward. My argument is this:
---
Ya get it eventually, it is special ordered outside of Bungie, it is something contracted for a special interest and paid for for only that purpose.
---
So what the hell is the point in wasting any more breath over it if we are running in circles on it. You write Microsoft, I'll be content with knowing that's how capitalism works. And the time gate happened far before Activision and Bungo split.
---
I'm just saying, the complaints are misguided. Are we really going to yell to the skies at Bungo for something out of their hands and not even their problem? If Sony never made this offer... guess what? Microsoft still wouldn't have done shit. Capitalism is calculated gambling and in this department, Microsoft lost out. But we blame Bungie because that's easier. And it's also shit.
---
You have to do the quest chain titled "An Impossible Task" obtainable from Osiris. This does require you to have purchased the current season pass.
---
Sundial is seasonal. Menagerie is permanent. So, don‚Äôt be sad Sundial isn‚Äôt your fave: be happy you like the one that‚Äôll never go away.
---
Yeah I‚Äôll play with friends and one of them likes invading. Earlier he did and their guys with the most motes died as he jumped in, so he whipped out Symmetry and just said ‚Äúyeah I‚Äôm gonna be mean here‚Äù
---
It happened my first sortie if the new season, thought it was normal
---
Mom Im scared come pick me up
---
I was teasing you. No self respecting boomer would name themselves LegendaryHunterLH. That is a weeb move.
---
So imagine having a not so good past, but you‚Äôve turned your life around, and as soon as you start doing something, somebody out of nowhere screeches about every bad thing you‚Äôve done, even if you‚Äôve put it all behind you to everybody in the world. That‚Äôs what happened here to me, but on a much smaller scale. The ‚Äúsituation‚Äù was over until he got it back up and running
---
I mean everyone here besides Shaxx has taken off their helmets at least once, but no one has ever seen any of their faces.
---
I really like it, and Ive never been a huge fan of sidearms. It's solid in pve and it helped me get the 675 solar kills done for the vanguard emblem, yet to try pvp
---
I have the corsair void and I dont really like it, it's very difficult to tell what's above and what's below. Also distant noices get messy, like it's hard to tell if they're further away in front or in back, then itll get easier at closer range. Plus you cant adjust the sounds your mic picks up. I dont really have a recommendation in the same price range, but I personally wont be getting another corsair. If you want a good quality headset look into sennheiser, they're a little more expensive but much better.
---
That would be 10 times more intimate

I tried to shot him with a sniper, but he is a strong guy.

Hmm I'll have to check up with him again, cause I'm pretty sure I've done all the quests he has. Thank you!
---
I made my hunter before I was out, I wish I could change them to fit myself better... Bungie really should add that as a feature, even if it costed a little bit
---
You can see all the weapons that can have catalysts. Go to triumph tab then accounts then last tab which is where you can find them.

This isn‚Äôt wild. This is one of the most overused names on Steam.

I thought it requires you to complete the Leviathan raid?

You're welcome, and good luck out there guardian!

To upgrade it
---
Really glad I am playing this game with such a wholesome and caring community. Seeing all the comments just makes my day knowing there are still very good people in this world.
---
Whats wrong with my name?
---
Your comment makes no sense. But ok
---
Yes I agree the games an mmo that's growing but what I see is people expressing there frustration with things and it does help the game you think oem would of been fixed without the community complaining (still broke BTW) and recluse no they would of been still stomping round pvp now scouts are meta so they become less relevant but that's of subject all I'm saying it's good for the community to complain and that we shouldn't have to wait a year for fixes and content I find it pretty shitty that there's only one vendor that gets refreshed every week and that's the store there's more content in one month's eververse than a whole season and what ever you say that's preposterous

Empyrean is the official name for the latest Warframe update, Railjack. Empyrean Foundation is also the name of [something in D2](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/129/129956/Destiny_SoD_Calendar_EN.jpg), being made available on the 4th of February.

Protect your light! Fellow Guardian Dad. Good vibes heading your way.

Could give them drawbacks like really slow ready and stow speed, low ammo count, and only being good at medium range.

Why not? Why does the Undying Mind count? It‚Äôs not even here anymore but the others are. And I thought the Hive Abomination was something else so I didn‚Äôt say anything lol. I only know him as Phogoth the Unchained

I should have been more specific, i meant the boss for the unique season activity, like the undying mind and the three flayers.

Hmmm... Exposing our secrets but not talking about titan's "no" OEM titan, huh?
---
The fact that this guardians title is "Enlightened" makes it 10 times better.

Lots of pp touching going on
---
I would like to see Displate pick up the artist and I'd purchase a copy for my living room wall.
---
This is a name on xbox 1 and I met him on rocket league
---
Honestly, think about it... getting the knife back isnt 100% chance... its not 100% chance that youll get a precision hit, not even close tbh. It takes great accuracy to hit a moving/far back guardian. Its fair, just let these dumb ass posts stop
---
Reminds me of all the trip mine kills I'd get in D1.. good times
---
Cuz of the dumb quest. No one really touched arbalest 2 weeks ago.
---
Ok I see. You should still cross off Omnigul and Phogoth though. We have their nightmares here, they definitely won‚Äôt be back.
---
While this is true, I'm definitely going to keep using it. It's a fun alternative to sniping and while it is a worse choice than a sniper, it still puts in work. I finished Komodo in like 5 matches because of how easy it is to get kills with it.
---
Source on that?
---
Getting a headshot ain't broken, it's just skillful play!  
---
I can't believe people complain to you after getting killed by those three weapons of yours. If you get killed by a sniper you're not using the massive amount of cover crucible matches offer you, and if you get killed by shotguns then it's just 'cus you let the guy get too close and gave them too much time to aim at you!
---
Drifter eats fallen, perfectly fine.
---
Fallen eats people, everyone thinks genocide is the only answer.
---
How many times will this get reposted? This was getting shared all last week. Give it a rest.
---
Using a gun doesn't always give you an idea of if it's good or not or what it's good against and how to build around it. Imagine if you got a terrible roll on a spare rations and it didn't feel good and you just dismissed that weapon as not worth it. Also people like to know exactly what they are grinding towards and getting every single weapon in the game is something a lot of people don't have time for.
---
My Guardians look nice enough, like all of my characters, but like all of my characters, they are just like me, and so must hide their face away from daylight. And nighttime. And strangers. Oh, don't forget from friends. Reflections. Zucchinis. Chowder from Cartoon Network. The list goes on.

The Um what is the fact that the shader Preview doesn't show any of the actual colors, it's Righteous, with MK. 44 Stand Asides.
---
Did you get to the queen? I also want to go there to get an Ahamkara bone but don't want to do blind well if I can't go through the portal
---
As a Warlock I cried into my dress ;-;
---
I know that the players are there on the moment you join (you can check Roster tab in open world also) but only appear to you when you load same area as they are in.
---
Why bother with YouTubers?
---
  
---
They all suck and have the same canned response to every gun.
---
If they get killed by it = op
---
If they can get kills with it = balanced
---
If they can't get kills with it = either broken (if killed by) or worthless (if not killed by)
---
That is actually the one thing I actually don't fault him for.  
---
He figured assassinating Uldren would trigger a war with The Reef.
---
Arent they in the same perk slot?
---
Im fucking sorry for using the lord of wolves, but I really want python
---
Yo, google DIM (Destiny Item Manager) log into there and check postmaster. If they appear there, you can pull them to you Character
---
Yeah this happens so often.
---
Stop having 15 motes when the enemy team is close to getting their portal
---
So true
---
No is still active and doable. On morgeth it seems to work best (or at all) when I "yeet" glitch one of the ogers, does not seem to work with a simple thrall or such
---
I wish that ZuZuVela would get some love, a cutscene or maybe even a season around the vanguard and all involved
---
Left it in
---
There are a few people complaining about it on the forums Bungie said they've noted it. Moreover, when you click on the strike, it brings up the S9 prompt, so it's defo bugged.
---
If they left it as S8 content, they would've removed the quest outright.
---
Charlemagne(the discord bot) can tell you anything you want; if you put in The correct !call out
---
Hate to be that guy but you can‚Äôt finish the quest atm. Last mission you need to do a specific strike  which was only available during season 8. Sorry bud, I‚Äôm in the same boat. Apparently it should be coming back around but yeah, not at the moment
---
Or you can be a dick and go into a strike that load  into the open world like mercury, corrupted,  pyramidion and instead going to strike just stay there and kill mobs or go to a lost sector.  Because you got to the planet via strike option, every kill counts toward being in a strike
---
Nah I meant that many deaths
---
Then I saw light level
---
Welcome Guardian! We've all been new to destiny at some point but now is possibly the worst time to be new thanks to the lack of basic instructions from bungie but we have a great community behind this game we love to help!
---
Beginning
---
Well the first thing you'll likely want to do, if you haven't already, is start the red war campaign and work your way through the rest from there. You can start the quest lines for each from Amanda in the hangar of the tower (the campaign's are fairly self explanatory but you're able to open up a side window which should tell you where to go for each)
---
Levelling
---
After you complete the campaign's there is still a heap open for you to do, but the first step to get to the end game is to level your power, you'll get above 900 fairly quick just playing the campaign's and after that you've got to complete weekly objectives (signified by a yellow star like shape) which award 'powerful gear' this is what allows you to further increase your light level once you reach the soft cap which is 960 as of the current season (someone correct me if I'm wrong please) rinse and repeat these weekly objectives and eventually you'll be ready for the end game content of Destiny 2.
---
End game
---
As the name suggests this is the high difficulty, high reward aspect of destiny. These activities are things such as, nightfalls for the vanguard, iron banner and gambit prime for PvP and Raids which are the real end game pinnacle for most players. 
---
For Nightfalls on anything below 920 power there's nothing really different to the normal strike playlist aside from champions (enemies that have special modifiers to make them harder than normal) and all around stronger enemies. Above 920 however you will need to put together or join a group looking to do a run, this is what is referred to as LFG or looking for group, you can do this through the Destiny 2 mobile app or a number of websites online.
---
Iron Banner is a limited time PvP event in which your light level comes into play like PvE, you will do more damage to people who are lower level than you but at the same time you will take more damage from those higher than you.
---
Gambit prime is a game mode where PvP and PvE meet, you bank motes from killing enemies to call up the big boss. At the same time the enemy team will be banking their own motes summoning 'blockers' which will slowly drain your banked motes and the enemy players themselves will invade to kill you and impede progress.
---
Raids are the large scale PvE activities, 6 man fireteams who are made of either clan mates or people from LFG sites will enter to take down a great enemy after fighting through a number of encounters.
---
Hope this helps some but if you have any other questions I'm happy to help! I'm a PC player myself with over 500 hours so if you're ever looking for a couple people to play with or help you out if you're stuck you can hit me up :)
---
Yes, season of dawn messed a lit of things up. So just gotta wait
---
pretty sure all the homies on r/traa wouldnt appreciate being called a t*** because someone decided they spoke for the entire community
---
Imagine a real crossbow as an exotic heavy weapon. One-shots a player, takes off a ridiculous amount of health from bosses, but has something like a 20-second reload time, and will auto-reload *if* you have empty heavy ammo reserves and pick up a heavy block so it's actually remotely useable.
---
i have all the collectible ones from around the planets, my only question is which ones drop at higher light value. Some drop at equal or less that your average light. You know what i mean?
---
It‚Äôs my d1 warlock I stopped playing because 2 can out. The bot put it in the results for LW
---
Why is your aim so jittery
---
i was heavily considering this after a troll clearly aimed for the ones i was shooting at. I was sure i had 25 bow kills but you know the story.
---
I think my hands are broken, pls help.
---
Hit 218 without using any exploits. Just do bounties and weekly activities.
---
I agree, such engagements will leave you either critically wounded or dead.( in PvE )
---
Yeah, I occasionally do that and most time I've seen others in my group do that. I once loaded in a strike where all 3 players had same intention. It goes around  
---
But if you do this, I'd advise to once you're finish to go help out finish the strike
---
can u tell me your routine please ? and do you open the bounties with 1 or 2 fireteam members ?
---
It's the skill based matchmaking being borked, I run into the same issue personally. My biggest issue pre fabled last season was as a New Light player I was pitted against Mt Recluse and lost those games constantly until I hit heroic and got the recluse myself and could easily out play/gun those players in return. 
---
There needs to be a system in place that stops people who've never reached fabled before matching against those who have so you don't come against pinnacle/rituals too much (looking at the great ones like revoker, Randy's, Redrick's) that don't need fabled and those that do. Pinnacles just offer far too great an advantage for those that don't spend hours farming a complete PvP loadout. 
---
Until then my advice is to use lfg (looking for group) services like websites and discord to get a group so you have the communication advantage and to grind out some good PvP rolled PvE acquired guns to level the playing field (mindbender, wardens law, service revolver, beloved, erentil, curated hammerhead etc).
---

---
It's never been fair, you're competing. They're gonna do whatever it takes to win and ofc you'll go against premade groups. They know most times random sucks ass (still goes in solo) I'd say find a few people who love comp and can be competitive but also not being dicks at the same time.
---
I completed forsaken a while ago and now my friend got it so I can/have to see everything that happened again
---
But it worked befor just fine rapid fired it all the time just now i am experiencing this
---
Xur is your friend
---
1. Do you own forsaken
---
Try the fireteams page. Here you won‚Äôt get anybody. You can also try the destiny app in the fireteams section for all lfg. I doubt anybody with schedule ahead of time like that though. You‚Äôre better off trying to join a clan and discord. Usually clans set up raids that was to make sure people will be available
---
Right now I‚Äôm using Austringer with rangefinder and snapshot sight, alongside the new gambit shotgun, python.
---
I‚Äôve been playing for a while, but these crutch competitions are annoying as hell, ever since they changed comp.
---
Been known since day 1 of the new season. But thank you for the heads up to people that didn‚Äôt
---
It's either a legionary from the past or future. Our guardians fucked up timeliness everywhere, such as the tangled shore, but they have an obelisk there to stabilize. I would assume it's a poor soldier who got caught in whatever is fucking up the time line and transported here.
---
The issue here is that a LFR can't hold it's charge, it has to actually charge right before hitting and has a easy to notice sound. Bows can hold their charge, even indefinitely on hunter and have massively higher acc across the board already.
---
Or you know, enlgish/American people almost ending everyword with a K. "This is really fun to play withk" "think imma go get dress and make some dinnerk" it doesnt irk me or anything it's just amusing.
---
Nice.
---
is that what we can call the Golden Glock? :)
---
Maybe because you don't have Forsaken?
---
Wtf...you‚Äôre on crack. Loaded question was 500 fusion kills...1000 arc kills and 40 strikes...4....0 
---
That was one of the more tedious ones. The only one that wasn‚Äôt tied to any weapon objectives and just pure winning was recluse. That was it. Every other weapon requires 500 kills with your left but twisted sideways, 1000 finger blasting butt touches with your tongue up a horses ass and 40+ of the same activity...
---
It's not accurate you need the mythic. Some triumph say get rank x but you need to end up with rank z for it to register it.
---
Knife (Better than gun)
---
True, however when we talk about balance here, we are mostly talking about the most effective setups.
---
The exotic definitely doesn't fit any even remotely efficient setups however, because both nova and well would already be more useful without even using an exotic in the first place.
---
Then maybe the matchmaking system thinks you are good enough to play against unbrokens. Are you? Cause your other option is to afk until your rating drops and you're put with noobs.
---
Requires a little more skill than a sniper to be honest with you..saying it requires no skill
---
Is just you being butt hurt
---

Theres gonna be an obelisk in the tower at some point that will have timelost bounties and sundial drops of the perfect paradox, the pyroclastic flow, and the trophy hunter.

---
Happened to me but with my robes on warlock
---
dont thank me i heard it from i believe unknownplayer or moreconsole on youtube.
---
Does the game fail to connect when starting Forsaken quests? I‚Äôve seen the same since the update.
---
They feel the same way we do when you round a corner in crucible and a striker is already falling onto you.
---
The style is great and fits the game really well, great job, hope to see more !
---
This is the only thing I run. Buuuut the thing I enjoy most in the game is invading.
---
Guardians in the their super* which means you‚Äôre missing out on a perk like multi kill
---
Clip
---
Enlightened indeed.
---
Saint-14 was the former Titan Vanguard and Vanguard commander, considered the strongest titan that ever lived. He went missing while looking for Osiris in the Infinite Forest and was eventually killed by the Vex. Keep talking to Osiris at the Sundial and do his quest lines until you make the Perfect Paradox shotgun get the quest called An Impossible Task. That one leads you to be able to use the Sundial by yourself and go see Saint. For some reason Osiris doesn't give you all his quests at once, so you have to keep quitting out of his dialog screen and talking to him again until he definitely doesn't have anything anymore.
---
Dredd with urban is one of my favorite movies ever
---
When you kill 3 guys from the enemy team, them dropping 30+ motes, the fourth guy killing you and emotes on your corpse.
---
Still want axes as power weapons and have swords be moved to special weapons.
---
I played gambit till 5am for the ritual weapon today and just mountaintop cheesed any invader
---
All you did was calling things trash, not saying why they are.
---
Sidearms got heavily improved with the enhanced target aquisition and the shotgun is very good in pve thanks to overflow and one2punch.
---
What i can tell is that you are either completly clueless of what is or is not good or haven't even gotten any of them yet to test out.
---
&gt;That's another separate issue
---
Bruh faulty ram will fuck ya whole shit up
---
Yeah, but the exotic engram gives me armour 90% of the time.
---
Bruh it takes one leviathan run to progress to the arms dealer strike and then it requires more runs to get the upgrade.
---
All I know is that I've had a lot of success with it at mid range with accurised rounds, kill clip and moving target. Personally I think it's underrated and a damn easier grind than plenty of other guns (the curated roll is good too)
---
Thanks man ill try
---
REEEEEEEE HUNTERS REEEEEEEEE
---
Crying about shit that doesn‚Äôt even make sense helps us all out a lot. :)

"lol gO gEt a jOb"

don't presume people's economic situation, that's assanine, just because your life permits you to have disposabile income doesnt mean you need to put down others if they can't
---
I mean i have a job and i can't afford to really spend much money on entertainment, because i have a huge amount of medical bills, that's kind of why a lot of people play games, it's a cheap hobby.

Agreed, followed by forsaken, then rise of iron (not including shadowkeep as we don't k ow how it will evolve over its year, so can't fully judge) . After that, it's a little cloudy. I would say house fo wolves, warmind, curse of Osiris ans Crota's scrota.
---
It's all kind of subjective, but taken king was objectively the best dlc, as it came with a metric fuckton of QoL improvements and a lot of content, plus you know, the story was good, the lore got deep and the raid was fantastic.
---
Can confirm, got that medal twice when I was doing crucible weekly today and I'm a warlock main. Didn't get throwing knifed much either, but I am pretty trash at pvp.
---
I second the request
---
This guardian knows what‚Äôs up ^
---
Is this enlightenment you have brought upon the land of crayon-eaters?
---
Level 3 broom here. On my head.
---
An amazing picture, in my next life I need to lean how to do it.
---
a year one relic the idea of the weapon is good
---
for the year one meta that is
---
I do like Cayde and all and i brought forsaken and stuff but I don‚Äôt want to see Cayde return... even if he could and did I don‚Äôt think most people will like the fact that he returns because it breaks the lore and stuff like that idk
---
Exactly. Thank you. Most people think that he is a coward. 
---
But if he had send forces to the reef the tower would be vulnerable.
---
Same can be apply if you fight 1vs2 against 2 abarlest users then so it's all about out skill them and not because they use arbalest.
---
Ngl its been a long time coming, warlocks have hand held supernova and titans have the hammer and shoulder barge, they‚Äôre both easier to use than the knife, and the pull out time for the knife is just long enough for things to change and you to miss so really its well balanced. So stop complaining, now we‚Äôre equal
---
I mean I can do that with a myriad of energy snipers. Or a point blank shotgun blast to the face. Or one real good erentil body.
---
Naw man. The champion gun selection suck ass. Id rather just chaos reach and kill barriers champions before they can heal.
---
And its not like I've never been one shot out of my super before. Jesus I've been sniped mid missile.
---
He denied you a kill, prostrats.
---
If I'm going against 2 scouts they're both going to land more than one body shot because aim assist but I can still kill them and live. Its not the same when those 2 shots kill you regardless of where they hit.
---
The Hammer of Justice from Shaxx's Perky Nipple. I like it.
---
Using it as a slur against trans people yes, otherwise no. Im very femine gay guy and get mistaken as a girl many times, so couple of my friends call me trap as a meme, its hilarious.
---
I use my PP with freehand grip
---
So you're telling me I should be using the Erentil.
---
This is how I've done any kill quests for strike weps. Just manipulate the card from xur to give you added damage for whatever element wep. Find the easiest nightfall and you're set
---
This, this is it I hate gambit because of it it's more toxic than crucible half the time
---
The idea is great, and I would agree with you before SoD, but... 
---
New toptree warlock can skate on sword like sick motherfucker. If swords becoming special that feature probably getting nerfed, and I don't want it to be nerfed.
---
Destiny's ability to just disengage any fight is op
---
Just thought it was an interesting idea, not sayin it‚Äôll help you solo flawless a raid or a dungeon
---
Arbalest isnt op though.
---
It was announced as a bug and they are looking into it.
---
Yee haw partner
---
Holy shit I forgot collections existed lmao. It worked tytyty
---
Nope he got you fair and square
---
There's people willing to explain and guide..
---
If you're on pc I recommend the discord destiny 2 LFG pc
---
I like to call it the Thot seeker
---
You sacrifice a normal life, safe in the city. Instead of building a family, you build your arsenal and chase many painful deaths.
---
In going to go out on a limb and say yes, it's just you. Sorry.
---
Anytime my man.
---
Mind if I could get it too?
---
Are you asking to disable supers in comp?
---
I laughed maniacally as I slaughtered thousands with my combination blow X cross-counter.
---
See, the magic of this is that you just came up with a term that's way less uncomfortable for people! Femboy makes nobody upset (unless you call a trans woman a femboy, then shaxx is disappointed in you), just use that
---
It is when you get shot in the face with it.  Lol
---
And people say warlock jump isnt that good
---
Now don‚Äôt spend all that ammo in one place
---
Devrim is human so going outside is probably death for him and Lord Shaxx would completely dominate the crucible it wouldn‚Äôt be fair for him to participate in a normal game. That‚Äôs like if MJ never got old, became president of the NBA and played in any game he chose.
---
Still no. It has a charge up.  Snipers are instant. No point in using up your exotic, primary, and special slot in crucible for something that can be outdone by a blue sniper.
---
This is true
---
Shame shame shame
---
Why the fuck is there so much ammo on the floor
---
It is a 150 but yes
---
Warlock master race.
---
That‚Äôs not toxic dude.
---
Amazing
---
I think around one of the holidays (maybe last FoTL) we give him something and he remarks that it was a nice change of pace since he ran out ammo a while back. We should give him some ammo for Dawning
---
Gotta love a game about space wizards that's got nerds making Excel spreadsheets
---
That‚Äôs just the dreadnaught
---
Yes
---
Yes Dad
---
Triple down on Guardians banking their motes with Subtle Calamity (started on the Hush quest complaining about bows, turns out they're pretty dang good), get one arrow in the last guy before he Truths me, starts dabbing... and gets smacked by a phalanx from behind. Red War's all forgiven, as far as I care.
---
Anything that gives powerful/pinnacle gear. Zavala, Shaxx, and Drifter all have quests for exclusive weapons this season. Other than that you will get legendaries from any activity. Xur will have a selection of exotics every weekend and a fated engram, which gives you an exotic piece of gear you don‚Äôt yet own.
---
Its part of New light as explained [here](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-10-01-destiny-2-shadowkeep-guide-6007)
---
Ahhhhh I neeeeed the helmet
---
I find tea bagging to be more toxic than emoting. Emoting seems like just a bit of fun.
---
Too bad that helmet is trash
---
I... yeah that‚Äôs accurate
---
\+ You can also check the badges - these usually show lootpools for different activities. 
---
Pages like [light.gg](https://light.gg) also help.
---
Do you like Live Wallpaper?  The reviews were not promising
---
Im sure he doesn‚Äôt wanna give away his position either. He‚Äôs just a scout.
---
If you haven't gotten Buzzard yet (quest from Zavala) I highly recommend it. One of the best sidearms in the game.
---
This video is part of a series where nothing really makes sense, so I do not blame you for feeling like this, and I accept criticism freely. But thanks for watching!
---
i called that moon pyramid the Hive Kabba. just thought that that name was appropriate for it.
---
I did get it, yesterday in fact! Haven't got the chance to try it out in either PvP or PvE, is there anything better about this sidearm than those aggressive frame ones?
---
Yeah but Zavala still says this all the time like there was no conflict before
---
Yes!  There's a normal cayde, golden gun cayde, and cayde with colonel (his chicken)
---
What‚Äôs the lore behind this?
---
Cesear Saladin looks pretty neat
---
So the god roll list is up to date? I felt like it's missing so many weapons which are on the "better" side.
---
He could easily have been selling one, I just don't remember it.  It's all a bit hazy from D1 these days for the general QoL improvements and what was available when.  Main things I remember from D1 these days are the locations, weapons, some armour pieces and the raids.
---
I have to use low settings, and I still get 20fps. Got kicked the other day and my game uninstalled for some reason.
---
Idk if this is a thing but I've been finding that my blade Barrage are yeeting bosses off to God knows where...
---
Usually when I play one of the enemy team members does nothing but invade our side, even when primevals are summoned they just invade and regen our primeval health.
---
Super frustrating to get these people.
---
Prolly boosting another players account looks like they are getting the hand cannon kills for Luna and not forgotten

Finally someone else says it

This was a tricky one for me too... But chances are it's for a certain element/burn. Mine was for all solar armor. You can also check on your collections page, it shows the last 5 or 6 drops you've gotten including mods
---
I got Crown Splitter from a Chest on EDZ.   
---
I would guess its in the random loot pool for destinations. Save up a bunch of Resources and try your luck.
---
I love gambit and almost exclusively play it but I still can't get the truth so it's just a bunch of feels bad moments tied together by a little bit hope that always ends up being crushed
---
Actually, console always runs at 30 (unless there‚Äôs lag) :,(

Interestingly you've contradicted yourself quite a few times. I'm not even riding a high horse, merely trying to give you a good platform to defend your arguments, however you've squandered them all.

I'm a professional therefor you don't get to have a say is not a valid argument. I don't have to be a professional to have an educated opinion about it.

Really makes it hard to take you seriously.

i just need imperials, i need to unlock the final perk slot which is 8k, but i haven't gotten any drops. only to new sundial currency.
---
Obviously.
---
Mine looks cool though...
---
If I'm holding 15 motes that's practically a guarantee I'm going to be killed by an invader
---
Dunemarchers + Riskrunner makes me one shocky boi
---
I want one for Malfeasance that causes each slug to explode so you don't have to stack five of them and to boost it's range and reload speed.
---
That's if you hit
---
Yeah just sounds funny hearing k after certain words lol.
---
Top tree void titan melee heals on kill without a charge. That counts for completion of this bounty. No need to wait for full charge, just punch away.
---
He needs his W A L L S
---
Lunafaction Boots &amp; Arbalest for your friendly neighbourhood warlock in raids.
---
Yes. That's not much of a problem if you can aim. Missing a knife isn't the fault of the knife. Throwing knife is much stronger in the right hands. And I'm saying this as a warlock. Hhsn is overrated as all hell.
---
Yeah the combo detector is key
---
"We are going to build a massive, vanguard wall, and the Vex are going to pay for it."
---
It really is tbh but its balanced due to the shit super its accompanied by (only good if it's in a small area that's it)
---
Damn it's even worse than I thought. I'd play on my PC but my DLCs didn't transfer correctly (it missed forsaken and Shadowkeep) so I'm stuck on console instead of my PC. 30 vs 240 fps :(
---
Shhh next thing you know snipers will be a 2 shot kill in the head :$ don‚Äôt bring attention too it.
---
Personally I perfer Shaxx over Zavala, but in terms in voice acting, there is no one quite like Lance Reddick.
---
rip
---
What about a strike where Zavala runs around and kills shit, but not as an NPC? Kind of like the Ikora Nova Bomb moment, and then smacks the fuck out of the boss?
---
I've found that using an ornament it does not disappear.

Guys that look like this have a 150% chance of handheld supernovaing you.

I like linear fusion rifles :c

Br√∂ther may I have the link
---
Cable management much?
---
Balanced? It's not good at all, shit tree and shit grenade. I run devour since i just get more out of it and it's more versatile. Hhsn sucks but everyone says it's the greatest thing ever.
---
I wouldn't say team that's ahead in that situation has any extra advantages to keep then ahead.
---
The team that hasn't filled their bank on the other hand gets extra piniata enemies and doesn't have to worry about more blockers appearing while still being able to send them over, in prime a taken knight's fire puke can ruin a whole damage phase if not melted straight away.
---
I wouldn't be worried. The report buttons doesn't actually do anything (prove me wrong).
---
I wouldn't say we're dumb, I'd say we have a.... uh..... "sophisticated palette?"

What's stopping us now? The threat of Zavala's wrath if we're insubordinate? 
---
We fucked off to the Shore to avenge Cayde against his wishes, woke up Rasputin against his wishes, hung out with Osiris the heretic, we fly up to the Leviathan regularly to have drinks with Calus, we play *games* with the darkness under the watchful eye of crazy uncle Drifter - it's only when he was lightless that we actually did what he wanted. 
---
Aren't guardians a relatively self-policing force at this point?
---
Not an exotic weapon, but Recluse + Nezarec's Sin pretty much means Nova Bombs all day erry day
---
Asher also openly rants about how stupid the titans are.
---
Because it‚Äôs fun, same as all the Huntards using blade barrage but they never get any hate.
---
&gt;knit and gritty

Nitty-gritty.

I would not mind if it was an actual ¬´¬†remember when¬†¬ª post, I‚Äôd actually enjoy even, but wasn‚Äôt it the week before? Not even yesterday, right?

Am I too high again?

This isn't chonky spoods. I just used the word because Fallen are arachnids. It's just a captain or archon.
---
Last time I tried I had sole survivor, fourth times the charm, firing line, and boss spec. I was doing 27k a shot and could only get 1 clip in. I was doing about 150-190k in damage per phase. Maybe darci would have been better as it is a faster shot.
---
Shhhhhhh...it never happened
---
I see by your flair that you seem a trustworthy source.
---
Nezarec's Sin + Hard Light
---
I think you can still get leviathans breath, and now Ariana‚Äôs vow is a world drop
---
DARCI also does the job. It very nearly matches an Iza without catalyst.
---
Hold my hand cannon... -Bungie

Sbmm is garbage. Every single mode is sweaty. Playing your clone every game isn‚Äôt fun. Sometimes yes, but sometimes nooo!!! I would like to choose a playlist without it, but classic mix is flooded with people like me. I want to play all skill levels, not just the gods Eeff!!!
---
Yea it become annoy to hold F 30 times so recently i start to avoid blue gear if i can
---
Im pretty sure it was last week. But even so this pic has been posted on this sub 4 times today
---
Yup
---
As a hunter, I'm sad there's no weighted throwing knife
---
I made a excel sheet with most of the legendary weapons (per season / expansion)  
---
It dosent include all of the legendary's, i focused more on the "theme" for said season and tried to get all the weapons relate to it.
---

---
The rolls are subjective to personal choice/preference, but as far as wanting to collect legendary's you may find it helpful?   
---
Still working on it, addin Sundial/Iron Banner/Ritual weapons (previously known as pinnacle weapons)  
---
The only view screws up the borders and images a bit, but still good.  
---
Enjoy!
---
Man, you're ripping them up! That clip reminds me of the good ol' days where everyone used the 3-round burst sidearms!
---
U may be right. I think with next gen consoles everything will mess well with pc. Especially xbox.  Hell it's basically a corsair one design
---
When are we getting an update on the status of it? And where
---
Okay I can agree that blade barrage is total cancer. Mayhem would be a better place without shards of galanor blade barrage hunters
---
Yep. This Guardian gets it. You‚Äôve got my upvote.
---
Helmet: Always On
---
What did you use to make it? Blender?
---
I think someone posted that they found this guy playing rocket league also.
---
Vex Offensive and by extension the weapons it dropped are gone.
---
The armour, weapons and ornaments dropped from the seasonal artefact are gone.
---
The Exotic weapon Eriana's Vow is currently unavailable but will be back later.
---
Leviathan's Breath is still available in theory but in practice the final step is busted until it gets a hotfix.
---
"The monsters, they eat chidlren in front of their parents!"
---
Haha that's so funny!
---
Dredd\*
---
Honestly why the need for wall hacks. 
---
Knowing the mote count for players is fine but why the freak does the invader need to know where the enemy exactly is behind cover.  
---
Then idiots wonder why it's always different sniper/ shotty sweeps.
---
Embrace the Praxic Fire Brother
---
I like how you determine what it‚Äôs fun for other people.

Nope. You‚Äôre using a tool to get shit done and then move on to do some other shit.

Check out Ehroar on YT. He has all the PvE numbers covered.
---
:(
---
I was partly inspired by [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0fhYZLevps) scene between Cayde and Ghaul. For the Guardians it's about sacrifice (whether the light ressurects or not), but obviously we're not guardians, we're human and we want l00t. :)
---
Zone into Garden of Salvation raid and there are several waves of Vex that spawn before you enter the raid. You can solo these and then reload into area and repeat as needed. This works for Osiris' Saint14 quest to kill vex too.
---
You can farm the location where you first got the divinity quest.
---
I got mine from the Drifter. Not from a bounty but from the Drifter himself.
---
Got one with ricochet, feeding frenzy and vorpal. It's just awesome
---
Yeah I just finished it. Thanks! All that's left is the raid.
---
So if what you say is true, I gather that I am not too high.
---
So nickname didn't hint you at that?
---
Cool thanks I will check him out
---
Probably anything with One-Two Punch will optimize damage. Especially with good melee exotics on.  Escalation Protocol Shotgun, Moon Shotgun, and the new Gambit Ritual Weapon is a pretty beast shotgun.
---
Bro
---
I did

Mountain top without fighting lion or militias birthright, so I think I have the upper hand here.
---
I think it‚Äòs for Eva
---
You are indeed not too high
---
Oars key? Never heard of it.
---
nothing feels better when 6 stack sweatlords are put to down by randoms.
---
You wear pants? Lol
---
I didn't think it was as bad as people on the sub said but you guys weren't exaggerating that thing curves behind walls to kill me
---
Not to get off topic here, but legally the ‚Äúgun store‚Äù (if such a thing exists) can be just as culpable.
---
Lmao codm now that‚Äôs the real joke.
---
Well, I spent the entirety of Sunday grinding it and also managed to hit Fabled 1bc I need a reset for 21% anyway. I used Retold tale and Malfeasance to deal with bosses/invaders. Wasnt too bad, just took time.
---
Idk if its worth it yet because I havent had much time to test it but I actually prefer running a shotgun in my energy slot because I found a Steelfeather repeater with Grave robber/Swashbuckler so my melee build would love it. So for me personally - yes its worth it.
---
Sounds like a name lol
---
It‚Äôs an emblem variant, pull out the original from collections, inspect it and you can choose the variant from there
---
Ha ha ur life is a joke
---
Idk if can post link here so I'll just write you the name: crystal dolphin by engelwood
---
Orpheus ReEEEeEgs
---
I like when I panic use my grenade launcher point blank.
---
what helmet is that and how can i get it

No, what it actually does is center your cross hairs back to the middle horizontally while running. Maybe you should look up what it does before you make assumptions.
---
PC MASTER RACE
---
I just found out too, but thank you very much.
---
*I* don't. Some might because they like ruining the experience for others. That's one of the more common reasons people make alts (even if some claim that they are "trying to learn a new role" or some such excuse) in games where there exists a strict MMR/ELO system.
---
I mean it‚Äôs not really that bad tbh.
---
or maybe they're writin some sick detective novel where they find a lead from gold

I didn't realize how good Izanagis was for gambit until I realized I didn't need to aim for the head.

thanks

*Gently slaps Xenophage*
---
Ol' girl here has seen me through quite a lot of invasions. Even made an invader rage quite once. It was a good day.  
---
(I'm trash tier at PvP/Invading, but xenophage is just as good for invading as it is stopping it!)
---
I'm not familiar with the exact emblem you're referring to, but there's a good possibility it's a modifier for a previous emblem. I would check your collection for an emblem that references The Arms Dealer, then there should be an option to inspect or configure or something when you hover over it, that allows you to change the picture.
---
The Huckleberry + Crest of Alpha Lupi in PvE. It's really fun to run into a room, start decimating ads and before my health gets low just pop a barricade and get right back to it.
---
When you wonder who the third guy is with 2 kills after 6 rounds of survival.
---
Dear  players   that   run  Arbalest  on  Gambit to invade.   
---
I  do sincerely  hope  i  dont   encounter  you

i have  a  very   Short  fuse   when  it  comes  to  bs like  this...  and  i  Will not  hesitate  to stop  what im doing    to  Swap  weapons  and  Lazer  you  with  my  Izanagi...   U  think  its  funny   1  shotting ppl with  Arbalest?   wait  till  i  Lazer  you across the map  with  an  Izanagi,   you will have   everything ... but  fun.   :D
---
Who then says the guy who is scrolling reddit
---
Your life is a sad excuse at god trying to make a joke, but stuttering all the way through.
---
Shouldn‚Äôt you be in school right now kid. Maybe quit playing shitty mobile games and go back to recess.
---
So what's stopping you from going on the D2 LFG discord and getting a 6 stack?  Just takes a few minutes.
---
Or are you referring specifically to wanting there to be a solo queue vs group queue for all pvp modes?
---
Quick Play is cbmm so it doesn't take into account any ELO
---
In America, there are plenty of licensed gun stores who have a permit to sell guns for self defense. They don't sell them because they want people to shoot up a school or something, but that's beside the point. My point is that you can't blame Bungie for trying to get people to play all their content and then people just ruin it for everyone else.
---
Are we going to get into a lore fight?  Alright then...
---
&gt;	everything we need to lead a conventional war.
---
&gt;	enemy will pull out their heavy artillery, dig in and make it into a stale, space-trench warfare.
---
Not exactly a huge problem, since I can't remember the last time we fought a "conventional war".  We're elite infantry.  Our modus operandi is surgical strikes, to limit exposure to huge numbers, kill boxes, and vehicle combat.  Reduce our weaknesses and amplify our strengths.
---
At most, we'd set up a diversion at this "trench" front and then cripple the enemy with precision hits.  If you're going to throw away guardians in a protracted fight, be my guest.
---
&gt;	Guardians will eventually die; no new Ghosts are being made
---
Source this.  The ghosts were made with the travelers dying breaths part collapse.  The traveler has since awakened and resumed activity.  I don't know of any proof that says that ghost production has not resumed.
---
&gt;	We‚Äôre not gonna take over or liberate shit.
---
Don't recall Ikora's goal being precisely to conquer the reef.  She wanted revenge, retaliation to show that the city is not to be messed with.
---
Don't forget that we are a faction.  What Zavala did was say to the system that you can mess with the tower without repercussions.
---
&gt;	This is why we have to kill the 0.01% of the enemies that count, their leaders, their most powerful warriors, their tactical and logistical soft spots.
---
Lucky for you, we are*very* good at that.  Play any strikes lately?
---
&gt;	Ghaul almost wiped out our entire Solar system for breakfast
---
Cuz he took away our light.  Tell me how you think Uldren and the scorn plan to do the same.
---
&gt;	we have to always fight when we‚Äôre in the advantageous position
---
Welcome to strategy.  If there is an advantageous position, take it.  If there isn't, *create one.*  That is the job of a Commander.  Zavala ain't doing such a good job at that.
---
I've had some close games, though now that I think about it, 95% of them ended in a loss, usually because the other team waited to drop three Large Blockers and a Small, or something
---
My one exception is my Backup Plan Wizened Rebuke, I've been using fusions since House of Wolves and I figure I've served my time. Eventually they'll get nerfed again and I'll keep on vooping.
---
Nah probably just a really good gaming chair and mouse pad.
---
It makes sense to sweat in comp, that's why it exists
---
[removed]
---
Looks like everyone else is using add clear weapons. Mr. 54 kills and 0 captain kills.
---
Python - gear up to shotgun it up in Gambit. 
---
Really it isn't as bad as people are making it out to be. I'm running a new Hawthorne's + Le Monarque + love and death to knock out both the python and hush grind, while not sacrificing the W's for my team. It's been a surprisingly potent setup, for someone who normally runs izanagi's + gnawing hunger + spiked 150 grenade launcher. Can't one tap invaders as they spawn in, but it's still been decent at dropping them as well as everything else. Think I have something like 50 shotgun kills left for python - which works out to 1 standard gambit match.
---
I'd prefer a solo queue for all playlists as I actually have a bit of fun in solo comp
---
Still fighting the same boss we were fighting 4 yrs ago.... how things change lol
---
Thanks! and yeah I had to try it out in the crucible for a bit. And the same I feel about NF. Got it last season and I still keep it in my inventory
---
yep!
---
‚ÄúEverything burns.‚Äù
---
Agreed, I would enjoy a solo queue for all crucible activities.
---
I still don't think it's a problem if people want to get a full squad from LFG though.

Figure out how to git gud at crucible. Don‚Äôt run into a new room or area without checking your radar. Pick your battles wisely and don‚Äôt be afraid to back off of an engagement if you don‚Äôt think you can win.
---
I guess they don‚Äôt want it to go back to its D1 Roots (sleeper was one of if not the best DPS weapon)

Imagine complaining about the only redeeming feature of warlocks

I just recently got 1K to drop so that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm using 24/7, and I‚Äôm literally addicted to wearing St0mpee5 after trying them in the crucible a year ago, I just can‚Äôt break the habit. Cheers!
---
Crimson is pretty much my go to in Comp if I‚Äôm purely working for wins and not on any weapon quests. The head shots with it are bonkers. Plus, it has a perk that heals you on every kill, reloads you on every precision kill, and if you have the Catalyst the range is crazy good.
---
I'll believe it when I see it.
---
Till then I don't even need a reason to keep killing them.  I'm just returning fire.

in crucible they‚Äôre becoming more popular doe

You'll be fine. Play the match and move on.

Something will always be the limiting factor for fps. You want it to be the GPU, so if you're getting 97-100% GPU usage, you're golden. If you're only getting like 60-70% GPU usage, it means something else is limiting your fps a f you're not getting proper usage of your video card. I don't know exactly how much fps you "should" get, but from everything you describe, it sounds like everything is working just perfectly, no problems. You don't want your hardware to be halfway utilized during a game, especially not the GPU.
---
Lool at that, actual armour, not socks and leggings
---
Leviathan (at the begining) was in the D2 original meta which required 2 primaries so yes, that is no longer an optimial choice. 
---
You'll want to run a sniper for most encounters, whether thats Izanagis Burden or a legendary. Your primary should be something you can clear ads with, you'll rarely need it for DPS with the other options (there are plenty of good choices as far as primaries goes). At this point, Grenade Launchers outclass other heavy options in terms of DPS. So try to find a 150 RPM GL with Spike grenades. The moon GL, Love and Death is a top option as well as outregous fortune from zavala, and Swarm of the Raven from Iron Banner.
---
Hes just got a couple of snacks, what are yall afraid of
---
The amount of hatemail I've received for using it in Comp is unreal. Most of them used by Shield Bashing Titans
---
Nope it's based on internal skill rankings similar to destiny tracker elo
---
I understand why people do it there entitled brats. Honeslty I feel like if your cought afking 3 times in gambit you should get perma banned from playing gambit for the season. Most gambit quast have recently have been stats like you said then reaching a certain rank I think that's perfectly fine because they cant climb in rank if there losing all the time from afking. Other then that it's the weekly and that's to play like 3 matches if they cant legitmently play 3 matches they dont deserve the reward. The simples fix for the weekly's should be line 2 wins.
---
Nice
---
Complete the rare bounty but do not claim it until you reach that quest step.
---
My finals are in 2 days so yes
---
Thank you for this info!
---
On your old system, it sounds like you had another weak link, a bottleneck that didn't allow your video card to flex its muscles to the max.
---
It‚Äôs great but it can‚Äôt understand any context because bot

How to Titan
---
It came from season 8. We are on season 9 now.
---
As of now, you are all going to run into an issue with that quest at some point not. Its very much glitched and it will give you the "requires season 8" error, and you will not be able to continue or complete it.
---
If i see a guy running LoW (it still one taps invis spectrals) oem, spare rations, hammerhead and bottom tree striker, I‚Äôm going to bag city
---
Thanks, i will make sure to avoid this at all costs
---
It's those frickin walls, they jump in front of you I swear
---
I know I shouldn't but I wanna try some.
---
Sounds better. Your screen suggested otherwise.
---
Don't try to aim perfectly the whole time Arbalest is charging the shot. Aim in their general area and then flick to their head as it's firing. You will get the rhythm after watching the yellow bar charge a few times.
---
Alternatively, get a couple pot shots with your energy weapon and then you can finish them off with an Arbalest body shot. This has a higher TTK though so you will end up losing more engagements, but if the first strategy is proving to be too difficult try this.
---
Tbh if someone uses a bow in pvp they big pp jus sayin
---
Fair point but for that to happen it needs to be a precision hit, along with the insta kill, unlike supanova or shoulder charge where they can be body hits so its a fair ish trade off
---
Arbalest isn't even really a problem, I totally understand the people who are just out there farming the new Ritual weapon in casual, and I respect that they're working towards something. My question is, why do I go into a Rumble to farm Arbalest kills myself and end up facing someone running Mountaintop + Recluse? What's your objective, man? What are you possibly trying to achieve with such a sweaty loadout in *Rumble!?*
---
Did it occur to you maybe they were just friends playing together? I'm really new to the game and not very good, but I'll do a preform team if too many friends get on for a standard 3 person.
---
I feel like it wrecks in all situations. I love it.
---
I totally agree. I am basically in the same boat. I will say however, that the times you get stomped in freelance and somebody messages you saying, "Trash. You should go back to pve" (yes that actually happened) make me both incredibly disheartened and want to get better. I'm a d1 vet, who got to the lighthouse once in all those years.
---
So to all the young guardians, Its comp so some of the people are extremely toxic. Don't let it get you down. Do what Shaxx would do. Get mad. Keep playing, keep getting better, and if you ever match up against that group of toxic diaper-lickers again, CRUSH THEM!!
---
But also don't forget it's a game.
---
That‚Äôs what you think
---
Is someone not part of an active clan this slipped my mind but I definitely agree!
---
I most definitely have caused a handful of wipes, cuz I'm bad, and need other bodies to distract all the bullets away from my face
---
Is that a bad thing?
---
I suggest reading up on how heroic public events work. It's so exhausting trying to trigger the heroic while some kinderguardian runs around murdering everything before it triggers. Still petty to threaten a report over it, tho.
---
Oh cool
---
No i absolutely dont feel the need to have the world revolve around me. You on the other hand should take a chill pill and perhaps get laid. You seem awfully frustrated over something. You wanna talk this out or you're gonna continue with this angry behaviour like some kind of apeman from the stone age? Me not liking the content we got this season is no reason to leave this sub. If you live your life like that, leaving just cause something isnt as you like it at the moment i feel bad for you and you should work on that.
---
Dude, I've only been playing since right before the Festival of the Lost started and I've figured out most of the triggers just by paying attention to what other people doing the event are doing.
---
Should be "Bungie devs" in first panel then "Telesto" in second
---
The fuss about one-two punch has died down a bit, as it's stacking with liar's handshake has been nerfed, but threat detector on a shotgun isn't bad.
---
Why is more hair growing of his shoulders?
---
Why are you booing him? He is right
---
Yes back when it was first released bout a year ago. Fucking was rampant for a few weeks then disappears thank God. And Now it's back sigh
---
He just bought a new gaming chair
---
Its been bugged, i dont think you were even supposed to be able to pick it up this season.
---
Depending on what you use. Reloader/ammo finder/scavenger perks for your special/heavy weapons to make sure you get the most out of your DPS. Raid specific mods will help, you'll get these from the raid. 
---
I use mostly all around armor (stats spread across all slots) but I keep an eye out for high Recovery/Discipline. Mods with have very little effect (if any) on your damage, aside from reloader perks, so to get optimal DPS, it will depend on your ability to hit crits quickly.
---
Haha, the only thing we 5 manned was calus
---
Do you have the season? Also whats your light level?
---
I just watched a houndish video on the current season, very helpful and to the point!
---
So should I dismantle it
---
Where is the catalyst dropping?
---
I know the upcoming dawning stuff needs a light level of 770, but I don't think anything else does. Is there a quest available to you on mercury?
---
Its because shadowkeep comes with the current season of whenever you buy it, and because you bought season of undying it gave you the next season
---
It came with the deluxe version of shadowkeep
---
Kinderguardian?
---
Why not keep the four color/texture combos for each shader, but have a button to switch between different "styles" so that it shuffles the colors to different parts of the armor so that you can pick which color you prefer being more prominent?
---
Which rifle is it?
---
Yes, on day one.
---
Legend nightfalls were giving me 2-3 regular paradox amplifiers per run and master runs were giving me around 3-4. On average, it was about 3 high level nightfalls for 10 paradox amplifiers which I traded in for the advanced version.
---
I find it much easier to just do this and get one APA guaranteed every 45-60 minutes.
---
I say wait until bungie clears it up. So just keep it just incase.
---
Nothing but the normal mercury stuff.
---
At least the rest of the year is only like twelve days
---
1.04 club!!! Wooo!
---
Machine guns for adding. Rockets in pvp. Swords for parkour or pvp or adding. LFR for yellow bars, sniping, pvp. 
---
Dps isnt everything, especially when you can deal (for example machine guns) hthat higher than average dps for like a minute straight.
---
765 and yes I bought the season. I had to take a few months off due to not having a working pc or playstation plus.
---
Thats his point lmao

Wait, what's It broken now?
---
In PvP it‚Äôs not the best. It‚Äôs range is OK and you need a full clip for its perk. That‚Äôs a tall order in PvP.
---
Erentil is better if you want range or Jotunn if you want a mid range fusion rifle.
---
Safe to say if the boss didnt go immune they'd be flown off the map like a character in sudden death in smash bros

"No spamming or reposting content"

Which doesn't make sense. Has someone posted something exactly like this? I rarely ever post in here. I see all sorts of funny posts and I finally have something small but I would think humorous to contribute.
---
Lol you‚Äôre just mad you died to a warlock.
---
i had the idea (but not with the cabal in mind) as a second solar trace rifle, it was gonna do massive damage to those caught in the beam (possibly enough damage to justify it being a heavy trace rifle) and would do lasting damage to anyone lucky enough to exit the stream aor unlucky enough to walk into a patch of ground that was also on fire from the beam, the only things keeping it balanced is the fact that it uses heavy ammo and its limited range (the beam literally cuts off after a certain distance, like an actual flamethrower)
---
Nice shot dude!
---
He isn‚Äôt even underrated
---
Sweet Business type beat
---
The dimensions are too tall. It crops out alot of the pic.
---
I highly recommend playing with a friend and running nightfall strikes, you can start grinding for powerful gear and xp
---
Honestly yeah it‚Äôs clear they‚Äôre going towards more themed gear each season even last season the hunters shoulders were taken from the genesis mind and the titans shoulders were from the modular mind, I‚Äôm hopeful but will never expect it to be definitive until seeing it
---
Uh, no. I say all this because I regularly get we rans in qp and took it all the way to legend rank with no issues. The point was that warlocks as much as they like to think they are the only class that doesn't conplain they always think they are not viable, which simply isn't true.
---
Do it, embrace the dark side
---

I did before Forsaken. I was burned out because I didn't know what to do, I was just creating new characters to go through the story line again or I would put it down for a long time and play other games. I was never much for the Crucible. Then they added Forsaken and Gambit and my fire ingnited. Even more so when i had to grind for Ace of Spades, I'm like... Ooh, what other hand cannons can I grind for? I like hand cannons. But I feel like what people are saying is correct, take a break, come back to it and hopefully you'll find that spark

Gameplay doesn't have to be recorded at the same time as it's posted. He may have held onto the footage. Or played in a custom. Supremacy WILL roll onto the screen eventually. Probably where Clash is.

Empyrean Dynasty was a step in the right direction. Granted it was paid unless you had a ton of bright dust and checked the shop every week last season, but the lion shoulder pads did not disappoint

Literally hover your cursor over the stats, god some people need everything explained to them in the slightest detail, whats the difference between STABILITY and HANDLING like bruh

 *  If I've got time, Pickup a spider bounty giving cores
---
 *  Head to gunsmith and grab any bounties giving cores

And complete at the same time (obviously grabbing any extra bounties for seasonal exp)

Between that and cores from scrapping weapons I've got a full master work armor set since starting half way through season 8.

---
Where is this number coming from? Surely not all weapons in a weapon type have the same amount of reserves. Also, the trajectory is so different. I don‚Äôt understand what is your point. Maybe the grenade launcher does not require headshots but you need to evaluate trajectory, etc. It‚Äôs really really not the same, there are so many variables you did not take in account.
