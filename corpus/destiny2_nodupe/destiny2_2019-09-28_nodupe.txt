I'll give it a go once I finish it.
---
It’s great for boss DPS
---
I wish I was that good at editing xD

October 1st gang
---
Incels are creepy.
---
I originally read it as “one does not simply a mysterious disturbance”
---
Thats pretty accurate
---
Can't justify paying 60 bucks plus the price of another season pass just to make the number next to my power level go up another 50 points and all the gear I just spent months grinding for to be obsolete again. I've been doing it since D1. I'm not gonna keep paying money to do the same thing over and over. Just because they put the name Shadowkeep next to it and added a DLC, why should I pay another 60 bucks for Destiny 2 again? I shouldn't have to pay another 60 bucks until Destiny 3. I'm good. They are very underhandedly turning it into an ongoing subscription service and I'd rather spend my money elsewhere.
---
Ya, the primary's in d2 are trash compared to secondary energy weapons.
---
“[This Week at Bungie](https://www.bungie.net/en/News) ”

---
If you have a few minutes, it’s a great way to see what’s on the horizon for D2, and what the developers are planning long-term!
---
Ty
---
UGH!
---
Playing patrol while smoking weed is one of my favorite things to do on Destiny, it really dials the atmosphere up to 11 and highlights how well the world building went about making all the locations.
---
And I’m here with 2k... feel free to share it!
---
Yeah. You get increased rewards until shadowkeep drops.
---
&gt; Also in a way it's kind of a good thing you can't upgrade console. On PC you can be playing on 60fps against someone on 200+fps. The playing field on console is a little more fair because we can't upgrade.
---
I have my games all locked at 60 fps, you won’t have any issue competing, even in FPS games.
---
The campaign was kinda fun but there was nothing to really do and quite a lot of minor mistakes piled up on the worst issues with redwar to create something abysmal
---
Convince your brother to get a PC :tbh:
---
/s
---
It's honestly great that y'all enjoy the game on your preferred platform
---
This... does put a smile on my face
---
each class has it's advantages and disadvantages in all aspects of the game. You should pick your class based off of which you most like the idea of or see yourself as. Pick which one you like outfit of. Hunters get cloaks, warlocks get bonds, and titan get marks. Each class is really cool and has a lot of potential.
---
• Titans aren't the best in pve right now, but are stronf in pvp. However, nobody cares what you play. If you play a titan you'll still find groups for activities and you get a thing called melting point which is god tier in Pve when you want to melt a boss. Like I said there are advantages and disadvantages. 
---
-Titans are your tanks basically. They are built to take a lot of damage and be sponges. You'll be a damage dealer and ad clearer. 
---
-Class items: Mark. Think of yourself as a warrior who likes to murder things with their fists and Punching is your favorite hobby. 
---
•Hunters are a well rounded class. I main one, so I can tell you they are good class with some hiccups. You don't get very good grenades and you don't get any way to protect yourself from damage unlike titans with shields and warlocks with healing rifts. They are a great Class ,but some activities you'll have a harder time Soloing than the other classes.
---
-Serious damage dealers and ad clears. Made for speed, but can be focused on anything.  
---
-Class item: cloak. Think of yourself as a edgy rogue that hides in the shadows. 
---
•Warlocks are a great class and everybody will love you because without warlocks we would all be dead. You are pinnacle healers and support group of the team. Your job is to keep everybody alive and deal damage when possible. You have some really good damage supers, but everybody likes you to use the big healing well.
---
-healer and damage dealer. Your recovery is trash, but you can fix that plus you have little healing rifts to keep you alive. 
---
-Class Item: Bond. Think of yourself as a space wizard/witch. 
---
*All classes are good classes. Hopefully you find a class that best suits you. Welcome to the destiny club guardian.
---
Im afraid that "living longer" does not equal "improved/more engaging combat" unless enemies start having unique patterns and ways to be dealt with, it just means "bullet sponge" to me.
---
I believe they already said the damage values will now be equal to what they currently are in PvP. So rampage will be 10%, 20%, 30%. KillClip will be 30%, etc.
---
Only benefit of me working 12 hour days is I’m too tired to play when I get home and just go to bed. Now what am I going to do! Stay up and play? Ha!
---
No. Cross save does not transfer dlc licenses. The shadowkeep Seasons will be cross platform if you buy them from your main platform, but shadowkeep will not.
---
I mean, Rampage/KC + outlaw is still the best. It's just not as good as it was before, nothing else has gotten buffed yet and damage traits still add damage... I dont know why bungie didn't just buff/rework other traits to replace/challenge the current "god rolls" but I suppose this is the easiest solution... even though they're still the same "god rolls"
---
4 rolls on one item, so you're more likely to get the roll you want.
---
F
---
Destiny 1 and 2 are easily one of the best looking games I’ve ever played
---
Destiny isn't the only game I play. In fact I haven't play it in a while and I won't be buying the next expansion. I've played more or less all PS exclusive games. 
---
Yes cross play is coming to the scene but I'm a controller player, I can't play on KBM. If I do cross play with console friends, I'll bring them to the PC servers against players using MKB, right? 
---
I'm just trying to think of the recent games I've played. Many of them are exclusives like Detroit:BH, Bloodborne, Until Dawn. Two big games coming out soon will be PS exclusives. I played RDR2 at launch on console. Batman Arkham Knight at launch without issues. All these amazing single player games are on consoles. I don't think I want to buy a PC to play multiplatform games that I'd want to play with friends. 
---
As far as PS5. Only time will tell.
---
The whole point of putting on low power level gear (Eververse) is/was to avoid ruining legitimate players forge runs. It's to match you with other afk players at power levels too low for what would be considered normal runs. 
---
Though it's a small sample size, the times I've checked in on my afk runs, I've never seen any active players trying normal forge runs.
---
These D2 players acting like they’re top dogs around here smh my head
---
&gt; Destiny isn't the only game I play. In fact I haven't play it in a while and I won't be buying the next expansion. I've played more or less all PS exclusive games.
---
This is a destiny sub, which is why I assumed you were a destiny player, thus making my comments irrelevant.
---
Nope. If the triumph is complete you are all good. Finish it next season. The step for 5 completions won’t show as complete in the quest log until you are up to that step. Just check your triumph is done and relax.
---
why did you post this
---
I got an alert when I logged in saying the servers will be down, but I know from experience that the servers don’t crash from volume of players. When rise of iron cake out I got up at 3 am on a Tuesday to play it and it put me in a queue 80,00 players long
---
My guess is lots of silver purchases
---
Lmao I made a comment last week talking about how “pinnacles being effectively legendaries with exotic perks is inherently over-powered and never could have been balanced in the first place.” It got downvoted, then I read the TWAB. Who cares, I’m the one going to school for game design.
---
The boons?
---
Use the other one. I forget its name. Which makes this probs the most useless comment lol
---
Seems legit.
---
Or OP never dismantled a single thing they got from Eververse
---
That's not the last step lol it's doing 5 valor resets in a season
---
Because it says I have a current discount of 4
---
It be like that sometimes
---
I know but I've already reset 6 times so I was worried about having to go through the entire quest again regardless of me completing the triumph
---
It locks and straightens when you finish that side
---
I’m hoping it doesn’t get hit too hard because just got back into the game and got it
---
I had a godroll better devils, (yes I’m f2p) and accidentally forged
---
It with a  light 500 gun. Now I just locked
---
My best gun behind a paywall. :(
---
What year is it
---
(dumb question) I seem to be a bit lost, I'm going to get shadowkeep on pc but I don't see any option to buy forsaken. i am transferring from console, so will forsaken not be available for me to play or is it included in new light?
---
Wait what? We can't 5 stack super gaining perks anymore?
---
Shhhhh don't tell people. I completed so many exotic catalyst from the Thrall room.
---
Still better then d2
---
This is why I actually prefer comp. I can’t stand how random everything is, I could spawn in and be in the middle of a gunfight with enemies using heavy. Latter 2/3 of the game, I spawn in and there’s always a super going, on top of the same guy still having heavy because Tractor Cannon &amp; LMG’s are ridiculously ammo efficient.
---
I'll be there
---
Love it, always will
---
Thank you, i got a new wallpaper now !
---
Samsung 512GB 950 PRO and Samsung 1TB EVO 860 for other stuff.  :3
---
They said TTK would be improved.
---
Go to [Bungie.net](https://Bungie.net) bro and it tells you.
---
Well she doesn't have a second guardian so I guess
---
Lunas= high skill
---
Ahh, so it doesn't matter if I haven't hit Fabled yet..
---
Especially when they are both on the same hard drive.
---
In a game like Destiny when the TTK is slightly longer (and there aren't any dedicated servers anyway) frames above 60fps will hardly make a difference. I also have my games locked at 60
---
Is that what he was talking about? I read that and looked at the picture and i was really confused what he meant
---
I haven't done it yet, cuz I'm a big scaredycat, but I will. One day. In the future. Ish.
---
I have that copy as well!
---
That I've never done it before, I only started playing like a week ago.
---
Wether we wanted it or not
---
Then once you obtain and unlock the catalyst... orbs for days!
---
Armor 3.0?
---
Hopefully not called Armor 2.1
---
And it’s 120, not 150.
---
I have a nasty D1 Rumble video. I don’t usually record unless i think it was awesome.
---
what roll do you have on that spare rations tho
---
How? You get handed 690 gear with season of opulence
---
No no no, Doom should be in destiny! Imagine dooms gore in destiny. It would be phenominal!
---
Where’s the coffee? Real gamers drink their coffee black!
---
Can confirm 😂
---
LMG BOIIII
---
The stupid thing is google shows these sites as destiny ads.
---
YouTube clip that is slightly better quality.
---
[Link](https://youtu.be/ykMEwzXOCtw)
---
No they meant 5 total they are just being dicks.
---
Going back on their word
---
I've never had the patience to grind for armor; the only things I look for are the speed/resilience/recovery stats and the ammo finders
---
I do miss the sparrow racing league tho. That was a lot of fun, and allowed us to break the monotony of grinding. Although, it was grinding to get the SRL gear lol
---
Ye
---
Cool sweet, thanks for letting us know how it works :)
---
Our greatest enemy... Bungie recycling content lol?
---
You say easily, but the amount of work that goes into a crossplay system is huge. With the resources Bungie has, it could very well take a good while longer, if at all. There's also compatibility issues to think about with how each version of the game runs, and if you didn't build the game from the beginning with that in mind, it'll prolly be very tough to add it in later.
---
I deleted it today because I felt I had nothing important left to do, and I didn't really feel like prepping more bounties for Shadowkeep.
---
Should become available on Oct. 1st along with the PS4 exclusive armor sets. Head to Xur next Friday. I bet he sells it
---
Everything is included with New Light (including Forsaken). Shadowkeep is getting you all the new stuff going forward until at least December (unless you buy the deluxe which gets you bonus seasonal updates going even further out).
---
DO i really have to download again the game? :( It takes me 4 hours to download it
---
Username... checks out?
---
r/outside
---
Thing is, I haven't seen anything about this topic anywhere.
---
Who's going on the Raid with me?
---
Was about to mention that. But "good old"? Isn't that reserved for the Ikelos, which for me actually feels like the old grandpa looking at those marauding younglings.
---
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
---
For some reason I cant copy a screen shit but it was mentioned in TWAB on 09/09/19.
---
See the "PLEASE NOTE" paragraph.
---
 [https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/46376](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/46376)
---
repeatable stuff would be the daily gunsmith bounties and 2 cores from spider. for the weeklies, knock out the clan rewards, do the raids for a chance at curateds and menagerie heroic for a guaranteed curated, then dismantle for cores
---
lmao full called it
---
Was pretty funny. Lol bagging all the doubters.
---
Are there any good youtubers to watch to learn cause I haven't played destiny since Destiny one for like day on release
---
I couldn't clear enough space on mine without deleting bnet D2 so I bought a 500GB they're pretty cheap now
---
Yepppppppp
---
Video games should be a distraction, not a focus.
---
Question!  
---
Do you need to redownload steam ver in order to play it or can manually change the execution location?
---
I play on a 970 and an i5 and get around 100fps on mostly high settings
---

you did not lose money, you paid to play destiny 2. New Light is a free jumping on point for anyone wanting to play the game and its first two dlc when shadowkeep launches. new light players can't play until october 1st, you can go on and play right now all you want until you have to migrate to steam. also shadowkeep players don't get any forsaken content.
---
[Here is the buying guide](https://i.redd.it/ntrlojowjio31.jpg)
---
Yes, I had a similar PC (same GPU, slower CPU) up until recently and hit 50-60 FPS on medium settings in 1080p
---
So you suffer
---
Managed to get my CE from the clutches of the courier service who keeps insisting on trying to deliver even though I explained I'm working during working hours.
---
Still unsure whether to open or not. Haven't logged in a long while although my hunter is hovering around 730ish LL.
---
Ideas? Make me come back &gt;:D&lt;

I am incredibly jealous for the past day and a half I havent been able to go over 100 legendary shards
---
Thomas the tank engine
---
Wow, this dude has got Destiny 4?
---
Donde esta la biblioteca
---
Nice
---
anybody knows at what hour you can enter the game?
---
Forsaken dlc will be free to all forsaken owners coffee shadowkeep I believe
---
I don’t have enough money for it I was going to buy it while it was cheap but I forgot now I can’t buy it
---
All she needs is Raiden Flux and then we will have a true Arcstrider.
---
Glitchy bird
---
Yea, it did
---
My highschool somehow okay'd "most likely to live in parents basement forever" 
---
I won that somehow and now I live across the country
---
I love how you had to fire your thundercrash in order to not die on impact.
---
Aah yes enslaved legendary shards
---
I mean, Threat Level has been in the game since December of last year, right? It’s at least middle-aged lmao 🤣
---
Sounds great, and can It crash if I turn on a certain setting? Because Csgo crashed 2 Times now but I can still play it because my settings are set to regular and fps rate 1280×900.
---
Not aware of it. Managed to run it on only hd4000 integrated laptop without crash though it was like 10fps :p
---
Holy shit I only have 7k lmao ... That's a lot for me
---
I have auto rifle
---
I have hand canon
---
Ugh
---
last word
---
The new armour UI’s look s w e e t
---
In the current sandbox, you’re right. Reactivating trench barrel on rapid fire frames boosts your total damage but slightly lowers your DPS. I don’t think Shadowkeep will change that much, since whether or not you’re proccing trench barrel you still have to reload. For High impact frames like Imperial Decree, though, trench barrel boosts total damage and DPS.
---
Ole meth falcon
---
Except one of them never worked and the other will work
---
Why does the kill feed show it as a shotgun? Tractor has its own icon.
---
Those reviews get removed by Steam bots
---
But you can just pull it out of your collections
---
Yep they are playing against real people....
---
Go see a chiropractor, that carry must’ve been too much 😂
---
I originally did but i came back and im having a blast.
---
Bo staff? Thats a tenno
---
Images that you can hear.
---
Yeah, basically
---
I know I’ll still be using it
---
I wouldn't say that the player bace has dropped.
---
Mine was Prosecutor, loved that auto rifle
---
They have Cross-Save, NOT crossplay
---
This curator is probably the same person that wouldn't buy a game that's on the Epic Store exclusively just because "Epic Games bad".
---
Darn
---
Hey no problem. I was in the same situation when D1 öaunched. I am very VERY glad i stuck with Destiny. Mainly because of the smooth gameplay and resemblance to Halo. Love it.

He’s got a net worth of a quarter billion dollars and is one of the most influential musical artists of this generation...
---
I think you’re right
---
It’s funny when people think there’s no player base. Look at the amount of people on r/Destinythegame and compare it to other games.
---
It'll still be very effective just not to the same extent it has been.
---
I don't know why you need to ask? No one has got to play it yet so how would we know? We are all in the same boat all excited for the DLC!
---

---
Supremecy is a rotating game mode like mayhem, but will become a standard quick play mode with sk.
---
Yup. Sorry buddy. The gameplay of PC, especially in Crucible, is so different that if they cross played, chaos would ensue.
---
😂😂😂
---
Well if u buy the digital deluxe version u get shadowkeep and 4 seasons after so theres a smol chance of it happening. Unless seasons and years are different. I joined d2 in forsaken but didnt actively play till it was end of season of the forge so i cant tell the difference between season and year
---
Besides it being a 2 year old issue I'm pretty sure was fix ( or at least I don't notice it)
---
I forgot Hawthorne had any lines other than “first you took out ghaul, woke up the traveler...”
---
Probably an anthem fan trying to justify them playing anthem still
---
Is this the exact same review people keep posting about or has it become some sort of copy pasta amongst the review bombers?
---
lol.. always same creature in different size and color... most shamelessness company ever.
---
I remembered playing beta, telling my mate: Wow leveling is pretty fast. Maybe I’m too hard of an grinder, yet this is just a whiny review tbh
---
Unoptimized? Are you serious right now? It runs smoothly on my PC.
---
No, just not a fan of ‘microtransactions’ which require you to spend 3x the price of the normal game to get cool shit. What are you: gay?
---
There have been a few leaks that have stated that we will end up getting Darkness powers but since Activision split Bungie could have changed their plans for the future. Take what he said with a grain of salt.
---
Hahahah “he wasn’t readyyyy”
---
The guy who wrote this is nothing more than a troll. Don’t even give him the time of day by commenting on there because you’ll get banned. It’s very unfortunate that these people can fall through the cracks and not get banned themselves for posting such ridiculous things about games not even out yet. I get it that he’s free to his opinion but he’s actually misinforming people and that may actually turn them off from playing this amazing game.
---
From what we know, yes you can.
---
aren't those like 10 glimmer each?
---
Ive been saying this since the game came out. If every game was optimized like D2 I would keep my 1070 til the end of days haha.
---
Cake
---
If you are sure you will be playing all seasons and getting the shadowkeep at launch, then yes
---
Also to note wow has been a franchise longer than Destiny, Reddead, and, CoD and Destiny is the youngest out of all of them.
---
It's still smaller than Halo 5, that game is fucking massive
---
Well you know, you never know. I'm just happy that Bungie is free to work how they want.
---
It will. OP probably just copied the icon from the BNet launcher for Karma. The Steam install one is inside the preload folder which is encrypted which is why it looks like the white piece of paper with the top right corner folded. It'll show the correct icon when Tuesday comes around and the game is decrypted.
---
Lmao how did someone write that already? Just looked and there is nothing. Also their playerbase is pretty high right now by comparison to year 1. My comp is a potato and can run it so idk mate lol
---
I've been waiting for a few months now, got a new PC and didn't want to install it on bnet just to delete and install again on steam
---
It was Activision who made them do it. Activision did it so people couldn't get as many free loot boxes
---
I don't know where to ask so I will ask here,if I have forsaken will I have it on steam too?Also do newbies get forsaken for free now?
---
besides modern warfare, destiny is the best optimised game I played
---
This. Those will be deleted, so might as well get what you can from them
---
It says it on steam's page itself. I know this is old but just in case others don't know.
---
To even further answer your question; I actually play with a gtx970/i5 and my game runs great. It's pretty well optimized!
---
*laughs in Halo 5*
---
Thanks
---
The game is extremely well optimized.
---
No Man's Sky.
---
Mad max is also supremely optimized for PC
---
Oh I'm very reliefed. I thought I had to save money for a 1050 or a higher gpu.
---
i play it on console and it runs fine
---
Reminds me of "fans" hating on assassins creed odyssey. That game is a masterpiece just in the history alone yet since it wasnt another ac clone they got pissy and review bombed it. People are fkn stupid sometimes.
---
This is a review from a curator, those can go up as soon as the game is on the store.
---
Well, yeah. Most of the time, but Not this time, I had BL3 to tide me over till then
---
Watch the full video here!
---
https://youtu.be/MUmmiQyffuE
---
I'm down
---
In the making? She looks like she'd whup all these Hunter wannabes in the Crucible.
---
No, but seriously I wanna see her in some padded staff sparring.
---
Yeah however there’s been ample time for everyone to do this.
---
I know there are cons but it is still cheating and if you plug in a MnK on console it doesn’t match you with pc players and it’s against PlayStation terms that if the game does not support MnK it is cheating.
---
Love
---
I’d wear it anyways. It looks great.
---
You don't need to upgrade to play current games, or even future releases. Pc lifespan is much larger than the console lifespan
---
*while im over here who cant get an organized raid team together and cant even do this*
---
He does not, probably why the review is top notch
---
:Pog: is a twitch emote, it's basically used to say that whatever just happened was really cool.
---
That review came out as soon as D2 was listed in steam, probably some dude who hasn’t played since launch judging by him citing the xp thing
---
Oh, then he’s probably for Game Informer
---
That’s cute!
---
Tbf we got a large portion on forums too, not saying we're bigger than wow but we got a lot of people spread out across multiple sites and they still have pretty big populations when compared to the majority of games
---
Yeah, not really. There's a minor edge, but on pc it's skill vs skill. Not aim assist vs aim assist
---
From console? I’ve been out of the loop and I just got a gaming PC. Would love to transfer my content to PC
---
Two accounts spamming the same link hm....
---
Does that mean, that if one buys Shadowkeep one has access to all DLCs?
---
Also big shoutout to  u/Altiax  for the artwork!
---
well fucking rip we got downvoted
---
This is why 6 year olds shouldn’t have their own accounts.
---
You can't outlaw cancer.
---
Never once experienced a drop in frame rate. Low settings on a 1050 AND highest settings on a 2070. Both rigs run it fine with its settings.
---
I want to feel crappy about my 2-3 minute load time on Xbox. How fast are we talking?
---
PC has access to almost every console exclusive.
---
Pc is also able to outperform consoles at the same price point.
---
There are sites that do pricing and compatibility checks for you (pcpartpicker) and there are plenty of forums and build lists.
---
There are just as many hackers on console. Plus you've got people using xim and modded controllers.
---
Here's my input. Although it's not 100%.
---
For new people easiest - eater of worlds. Hardest - Spire of stars/prestige Leviathan
---
For experienced people easiest - scourge of the past. Hardest- spire of stars
---
Knew it would be review bombed.
---
It's not, cuz they're on pc anyways
---
Whoever wrote this seriously knows nothing about the game
---
Cuz its matching people.. or opening a new server instance... tower most social spaces are like this... im running 2 nvme ssd in raid 0 and loading still suks cuz its not really loading wen going to the tower
---
Cake day brothers! And yeah double loading sucks
---
20.- that that is an angry spoiled kid that doesnt like to work for his loot
---
It is a normal, but rare thing. Each frame has a chance to drop a curated roll in the Bergusia Forge
---
Destiny’s Instagram account posted a pretty nice visual of what’s included in New Light.
---
congrats
---
Lmao the xp throttling was a controversy back way early in Year 1 guy
---
Good tips homie thanks
---
Ok but why is there a strike symbol in the bottom left of the gun
---
“FORTNITE FORTNITE FORTNITE” the thralls screeched with a ravenous hunger..
---
No matter how many of them I gunned down with my [free campaign] and [non-battle royale] content, they kept coming.
---
A blockade was forming. Made of their bullet-shredded carcasses. They smelled of Red Bull, parental disappointment and cheetoes.
---
They will soon overwhelm me. 
---
Godspeed.
---
it hit 1 million players a month ago so this review is bullshit
---
The more I read the more I see how wrong it is
---
Whenever a destiny add is on I fully watch it
---
Yes, my mistake it was like that in pre release
---
im running an apu (ryzen 5 2400G) and i can get 1080p medium at 30fps... so yeah,
---
You will have access to gear you earned on console but can't get more or play the content, at least that's what I've seen.
---
I get this. My marching band practices were 530-830
---
Yeah bro that aint a potato just btw. 1060 is only one gen old. Thats a pretty decent pc.
---
Unlike the ability, self-res just needs to stay dead. It fucked Raids, it fucked Nightfalls, it fucked ToO. 
---
Just let it go.

Literally the only reason they're saying they can't grow forever is consoles. People seem to think that 500GB is plenty of storage for games (it's not) and a 100-200gb game is kinda normal on pc, my ark install was 250gb before I purged old mods I didn't use. (I've got about 10TB in my pc)
---
This wasn’t a light level thing, we do not know if IB will be here or not.
---
Yes. Enable cross save via the bungee website. Play on either platform.
---
SCREEB
---
So can I blow all my planet mats and be okay for SK? Sim Seeds, Serephite, MFDL, PhaseGlass, Dusklight shards. Can I blow all of those for EnCores and LegShards?
---
Oh for sure!  It’s the only reason it can’t grow
---
that sounds familiar. where have i heard that?
---
this is where I'm at too. I was pretty much done with forsaken and stopped around the time black armory came out.
---
Lunafaction Warlocks: first time?
---
Hey I’m in that clan! Haha
---
Just blizzard fanboys that are bummed that bungie got out of the sarlacc pit that is activision.
---
Same for me, i have a 1080ti and it sometimes drops below 100fps on earth
---
Man if technology was good enough for the playable game to look like the cinematics I would need new pants
---
I Just finished mines yesterday and man it took forever and made me want to quit. Here is my guide to anyone who hasn't completed the quest or needs help
---
Some tips I used :  I played mayhem, i know it doesn't seem the best but for me it was way faster then quick play or comp due to heavy spawning in so much more and having access to it due to everyone dying every 5 seconds. The only bad part is blade barrage spams and sentinel  but i used  top tree Night stalker with gamblers dodge, Vortex grenade for covering heavy areas- reason being is that staying invisible often works around sneaking to get ammo even if you aren't completely invisible.  Weapons - Edge transit and Fighting lion(not the best grenade launchers but i had some good perks on my edge transit.  IMO i would not use triple launchers because you will need a strong weapon to stop others from getting heavy ammo and yes get greedy and have a friend or two that are also night stalkers guard heavy to make sure you get it. With your tether and two friends its a hell of a lot easier. Just make sure to wait until enemies  group up before killing anyone and its best to pre fire your super around corners that way you don't get killed instantly by supers. Hopefully this helps anyone :)  sorry its so long
---
I got threat level AND anarchy on my 3rd run...
---
I actually feel bad.
---
Not really.
---
I can't remember exactly when I stopped playing but I was pretty much finished with Forsaken. And I never played Black Armory.
---
What exactly do I get out of the New Light?
---
raspberry pi
---
♪ How could this happen to me... ♪
---
I know they'll only drop at 750, but if they drop as a decent rolled armor 2.0 I'm ok with that.
---
And we don't even know if any of those will definitely be powerful at that point.
---
I figure I have 3k of basically all materials, over 10k shards and close to 2k in cores, I'll be good
---
Back when everyone thought that there is a second social hub ... Haahahahahahhaha
---
Cause Itd be interesting to fight a lobby of titans instead of being cheesed by hunters who just either triple jump in the air till you appear and shotgun you or warlocks with their insanely annoying storm trance, I think it’d be fun ( just my opinion)
---
I had 60FPS on an i5 760 + GTX 670 @ 1080p. 
---
My CPU was almost 11 years old. The game looked super solid, too. 
---
Outside of like 3 areas total the game runs absolutely amazing compared to most games. They did a great job.
---
Firefly with firefly mod is even more fun :)
---
I'm not wrong, you know. Downvotes won't change the fact.  
---
I am talking not about the whole quest but about the part which is left for the OP.
---
Mine works on the 2015 MacBook Pro. Gotta put graphics to low but still does better than most recent games
---
I haven’t seen any videos that include shadowkeep gameplay/spoilers, do they have a spoiler warning atleast?
---
Well. Now I feel bad for humble bragging. Maybe it’s 1 generation older than that? My laptops got a 1080 and it throttles constantly, so I was always in awe of how much better a desktop is at doing its job.
---
So you play as a Titan and you think you're the one at the disadvantage? 
---
MEDIC!
---
I wish it were this easy. Official steam curators are posting these reviews and they’re everywhere.
---
Wish I could relate :(
---
I've only seen Datto's videos, and they are very clearly about shadowkeep content, and he says at the start of each of them that there's spoilers.
---
Thanks, this is very helpful! I guess it also applies to my vanilla d2 license I transferred to steam?
---
No one uses r/callofduty its too vague. Join us at r/modernwarfare though
---
I still see people complaining about year 1 stuff going F2P also. Doesn't make sense to me...
---
It has a huge playerbase and a lot of toxicity in competitive, but it is a great main game because there is so much you can do.  You can PvP, raids, strikes, gambit, campaigns, menargie, and dozens of weapon quests.  You wont run out of things to do unless you quit, so if you like it, stay.  
---
Per Audacia ad Astra!
---
you literally quoted yourself   
---
&gt; they stated they will be deleted for season of the drifter  
---
so i think it gonna be the same
---
Ah what a lad, thank you!
---
It’s a meme (don’t know if this is sarcastic)
---
yppah ekac yad
---
I honestly don't even know how to respond to that.
---
I thought steam requires you to have played the game a certain numbers hours before you can review it.
---
Do you fucking mind sir 
---
Cayde was the best written character in all of destiny
---
Outside of the Recluse... smgs are not exactly amazing. It also looks like he had the upper hand with his Loaded Question.
---
Like the upcoming Vex Incursions that will only be around for the season.
---
Real gamers respect other people’s way that they want to do things. Disrespect is wiggidy wack
---
I would love for reviews to be disregarded until you've clocked playtime in the game but since it's going free to play that defeats the point since anybody could post a review.
---
That said this review, as well as many others, were written as soon as the game appeared on steam and quite a few seem to be written about D2 when it released and seemingly don't want to update their review.
---
Borderlands 3 does not exist for me until it releases on Steam or basically **anywhere** besides Epic Store.
---
Don't mention consoles. I have PS4 for games like Devil May Cry, Bloodborne, The Last of Us, God of War, Mortal Kombat, Detroit, etc.   
---
But I'd rather play Gambit with AFK teammates than play first-person shooter with a gamepad.
---
\*shrug\*
---
You really shouldn't. They fucking charge separate shipping on each one. And shipping is $10 for domestic US shipping so. Have fun. I made this mistake thinking I would order a bunch at the end of the expiration date.
---
The game I play is good.
---
The game others play is bad.
---
I was working more on the assumption that if I pick up a bounty today, complete it, then use it when SK comes out. I can't find anywhere that SK becomes accessible Tuesday reset? If there is a link somewhere I would appreciate the share, i've tried searching for a while now &gt;&gt;
---
Wow that’s one buff R2-D2
---
Vulkan ftw. I really wish more devs would use it
---
"Planet" ¯\_( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)_/¯
---
Lucky... S.O.B... Took me almost 30 runs to get mine! Congrats! Time to become the cancer that plagues PVP lol 😂
---
Holy shit I reflexively downvoted, sorry.
---
Gotta say though Prometheus Lens was a fucking blast when the  Crucible Laser Show was happening
---
Guy clearly hasn't played in a while.
---
what are we supposed to see?
---
One of the best optimized games for PC out there, but yeah unoptimized...sure🙄
---
lmao got threat level on second run but never anarchy.
---
This is why I scheduled my surgery. I’m off work until the 22nd.
---
Fuck these curator. They always got their information wrong and banned people when they got called out. The only good curator is the memey one, the "serious" curator review often contain false or outdated information cause they can't be bother to play the game and just watch YouTube and reddit for other people review.
---
Holy shit, that’s highly unprofessional.
---
I really miss turboburb.
---
Right so I have been reading a bit about it and the controversy was mainly focused around the fact that it tued up with Eververse. Now, while it is understandable that people get angry when it is related to money, the in-game influence was none. Yes, it was an issue. Yes, it was most likely an intentional issue. But did it force people into buying cosmetics? Maybe, to some extremely heavy players that want absolutely every cosmetic. But not to the average one. Also, this happened during Osiris and Warmind, so not the best state of D2 lets be honest.
---
Overall, was it really that big of a deal? I do not think so
---
Twitter a good place but I also believe that the bungie store has them as well
---
dude, finish fast before the reset.
---

---
Laughs in Nidus
---
Wait it’s already been released on steam? As in you can play it, not just pre-order?
---
Outbreak is cool when you’re solo but really shines when your whole fireteam uses it and the SIVA damage stacks. It’s like a big Rat King: ok alone, amazing in a group. 
---
Plus the mission to get it is so fun. Go for it.
---
Ves, but you have to say it with a Hispanic accent.
---
Yeah, I didn't know the weeklong boosts would be happening back then. I knew of the final valor/infamy weekends but not the weeklong event following those. But it's stuff I can work on whenever, and like I said I've enjoyed the time off.
---
I was in college at the time and my programming professor straight up asked "who's going to have a halo flu next week"
---
Yeah if they pop GG you’re kinda screwed :) I did mine with Blade Barrage, and it *definitely* helps if you’re in a stack and your teammates know what you’re doing and make sure they don’t get killed. So many times I got the invader down in like 3 seconds, only for them to have sniped a teammate a split second before.
---
There was a data mine that was basically 100% accurate for what would be sold for bright dust/silver this season. It's certainly not random at all :/ a lot of mediocre things were sold for dust more than once while the popular things were never sold for dust at all. And the void ghost only came up once for silver this whole season. It's kinda fucked
---
im gonna take a hit for this... he was the best char in destiny and he was rly just an ironman knock-off...
---
Shh... let him dream.
---
Cayde 6 will return on the moon with a new ghost.
---
Yeah, I still have to pre-load on steam, which means uninstalling on battlenet.
---
Hope you like the game!
---
No this is great. They go on literally every game and say well it’s not fortnite so why bother?
---
This guy has obviously not played since CoO I can tell
---
No. 
---
And no.
---
Nobody goes there anymore. It's too crowded. - Yogi Berra
---
It would need to be a MCU style series to encompass the lore
---
pretty accurate description
---
Ugh I really didn't like anomaly personally but the other two were ok
---
I mean the loading screen are still occasionally longer than they should be but compared to the other shit thats out there thats nothing
---
Would probably get more traction if it was a more used exotic...
---
void walker could literally mean a thousand different things
---
Damn, gotta *train* hard to get this one.
---
The cabal employment of the chilegeddon pizzas to kill guardians and their ghosts from orbit is *DEEPEST LORE*

To be fair when he fudges up the mission start for Lake of Shadows strike, that was hilarious.

It's not how exos work, until they do, because space magic.

Why? Shaxx will have that armor again and you'll be able to put those ornaments on it

thats why i said backthen

Might be in the minority here but I HATED Anomoly

Wukong?

---
I think at least the oem should stay silver only. If titans want to have an unfair advantage, at least I want them to look stupid
---
Lmao drops in playerbase? Its been steadily increasing ever since forsaken, and only dropped during season of the drifter
---
Edit: spelling
---
I had the thought too! Haha.
---
SPACESHIIIP!
---
wait,  fortnite is on Epic Launcher, right ?
---
Bright engrams were a bit different a year ago, the engram also included some mods so the throttle was kind of making people pay to win.
---
Y1 mods were imo worse than what we have now btw.

Bruh. Cross save has nothing to do with performance. If you are worried about internet lag (which has nothing to do with graphical performance) just plug an ethernet cable into your PC. I'm sure someone else can explain the technical details a bit better, but the short answer is no, cross save will not negatively impact performance on the PC. Cross save simply means you are accessing your save data from another location.

Oh no, we're moving away from file size optimization at ridiculous speeds. Back when we still put games on disks, we had to be careful about file sizes - good compression was a must-have, and games weren't any larger than 30GB out of necessity. Now, everything is digital and marketing teams have discovered that not only do large filesizes make headlines, but indicate that the game has a lot of content. RDR2 (for example) could've been 45GB if Rockstar wanted it to be, but it's simply not as good for marketing as a 110GB game. Destiny 2 with all it's DLC could've been 35GB if Bungie had tried to keep it's size down (without any gameplay or visual hits), but why would they?
---
Luckily my school gives a day off that Tuesday for some holiday. Poggggg
---
It's a *fantastic*  Jack of All Trades weapon. PvE? Good at mid level DPS and great at add and major clearing. PvP? Great for just about anything so as long as you can tag the ground near another Guardian or the Guardian themselves. In things like Gambit Prime you can wipe an entire team from a distance in a well with a good shot.
---
Is it the best gun in the game? No but it's fantastic exotic that is useful in any game mode and that for my money makes it a worthy addition to your inventory. I don't leave my ship without it!
