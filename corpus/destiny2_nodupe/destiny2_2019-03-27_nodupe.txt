Only 6? Your lucky! I went from like 100 points away from fabled all the way down to almost heroic 1.

I finished mine not this past weekend but the weekend before it. I just spammed blast furnace &amp; graviton lance. For me, it worked because I was able to keep my distance. I’m terrible at PvP, my reflexes are terrible and I get tunnel vision easily. 
---
This weekend: Wavesplitter dropped during a Reckoning match, Thunderlord dropped during a gambit prime Completion. Not to mention a fully masterworked BrayTech Osprey. Shit was wild 
---
Im good friends with maggie, dont you worry
---
He doesn't drop the maggie with the reborn pack. He drops a different gun.
---
Lol I get so anxious and choke like a deer in headlights
---
I could not resist....4:42 until I was in the tower.
---
What elephant? 
---
Oh sorry. Thanks for the tip though
---
That's last season's iron  banner armor. It's two different sets. You can't get this set any more. 
---
Thanks for the advice. Hand cannons are my favorite so I’m itching to get thorn, malfeasance, and the last word. I wish I could get Luna’s Howl but that seems impossible for my skill set lol 
---
Mr. Ophidian is from the original Destiny. My own Ophidian Jr. shown with Metro Shift shader. 
---
Ah ok. Thanks for the info!
---
Got ambitious assasin on my roll. If I kill a ton of ads then reload, my max mag cap is 108, up from 68. Its amazing
---
Ask yourself, "Did I throw enough grenades?"
---
The forge is a bitch, but it’s a lot easier if you use riskrunner. Also riskrunner makes it more fun, especially because you can go all trigger happy in it with all the arc damage the enemy deals.
---
I kind of enjoyed it. It was the most the game felt like an MMO for me haha
---
All it takes is practice 
---
In his defense you used the down syndrome weapon.
---
How do I access it? I’m 696 have annual pass and just started 3-4 weeks before this season started 
---
I mean, if it is the guy at 640 LL then he can definitely peace out lol
---
The handle I suppose. It reminded me of a vaccuum for some reason.
---
it was originally built out of lego, so it's smaller than it looks

*"This isn't even my final quote!"*
---
I am garbage at crucible. I never touch comp. I've only reset once.
---
I earned Ace and The Last Word during Iron Banner. It's a prime time for grinders who hit max LL to use that power to "even the score" with the crucible gods. They will be taking on The Iron Burden (-100 LL for matches) to get triumphs. GOOD. They can get triumphs and you have a chance to get kills.
---
I'm sure you've read advice on what kind of gear to use. Get your best void HC, a reliable HC main and a void heavy that can cause some carnage. I went with Slowva because I know it clears blocks and gets multi kills. Use blades. Use the shield. 
---
Go HAM. Tryhard. Sweat it up. Call it whatever. You have a week to accomplish this task The iron is hot. The time to strike is now.

I believe in you Guardian.

&gt;To rend your enemies is to see your essays not as work but as objects hollow of spirit or meaning.

To run quests is to see your gaming session not as enjoyment but as objects hollow of spirit or meaning.

You’re the best
---
Needs more hunters. Needs more "Made Shaxx Proud" emblems.
---
The lego version looks alot better tbh. It looks like a futuristic flintlock pistol. 
---
I'm more interested in what hand cannon that is..
---
I wanna hear "The Lady is a Shaxx!"
---
for fuck sake I got the roll i said I would get
---
then I got Quickdraw and High Impact 
---
I have the same oneeeeeee
---
Incorrect there's no spectral blades on the other team
---
SAAAAUUUCCCEEEE
---
I got 3 of the shittiest hammerhead
---
took the bullet for everyone
---
Unhappy cake day for bad post
---
For?
---
Your name says otherwise 
---
No, it's just one of many scannable things in D2 not an adventure 
---
Live today to play tomorrow. Forego some of those things and it might take you a while to come back.
---
Middle tree, in forsaken
---
You forgot "OH MY COTTON SOCKS! Did you not hear anything I just said?"
---
Oh, I did not know that! 
---
Wait, I thought it was percentage?
---
I also remember the time he jumped into the comms in a strike to get out of work
---
Theres a spot where you can't die. Just have 1 person hide there and your 100% fine
---
In destiny Dodge ball is more like "try your best to dodge a nova bomb in crucible" 👌😩
---
RIP
---
Hahahahahahah
---
Damn, I will say I did not understand the satire. That’s on me lol. I also had no clue bungie displayed last seasons armour
---
Yeah, how did he make it show as a solid number like that rather than a percentage?
---
you say that, but have you tried?
---
My favorite line from him out of all lines in the entire D2. That entire adventure is amazing Caydeness.
---
I blame Twitter.
---
Or dismantle 300 shaders
---
Adventure on EDZ. The one where the Cabal are using Taken energy to shield themselves. 
---
They mustve changed it. I know when I was working on it the first 3 or so days it was percent
---
r/suddenlygay
---
Yeah i had to search it up but i konw what there talking about lol
---
Just a bug or some people say powercap
---
whoosH?
---
I miss the banter between Ikora and Cayde. 
---
im 3 and a half resets deep with only 3.... i end most games with the most ad kills and have a pretty high pve kd in prime :/ never wanted to complain because i assumed im just trash, but it does seem bugged
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I'm also wondering this
---
The second to last step is a PVP hand cannon grind. If you play competitive or iron banner it increases your experience. I don’t really play PVP and never tried competitive but it can be done like in 2 days of heavy grinding crucible, you can probably do it in one day if heavy grinding if you’re good at comp/IB. The last quest is a bitch too you need a strong fireteam for Savathuns Song and recommended light level is 660-670 at least. 
---
Chungus
---
We platforming on those rocks the wrong way, i dont know bungo knows how physics work
---
I can hear it now: Let's do a Gambit Crucible hybrid. Players have limited lives and have to clear adds in an arena then battle to the death. 
---
You have the option to do the first half of the quest in pve or pvp. I would do it in pvp, it’s so much faster. The last part is a grind but it’s so much easy in iron banner since it gives double experience. 
---
They fixed the bug you are speaking of, what power level is he? Once you hit 680 or 690 it slows down to +1 from powerful except raid and primes. At least that's to my knowledge 
---
Focus more on staying alive, assists count too and will up your game the less you die.
---
New Single: Luna’s Recluse.
---
#PERFECT!
---
Yes, when you talk to xur he will have the most recent one,
---
If you did week 2 he will have 3 If you missed week 2 he will have it until you get it from him.
---
Not really my type.
---
#I’M NOT BLACK! STOP SPREADING LIES!
---
I’m not that good either, around a 1.4 kid ratio, but I was able to get it done in about 2 hours, find a hand cannon that suits you and then stay with the rest of the team, it’s better if you have a friend with
---
#I’M NOT!
---
They may be detonating it on the ground rather than direct hit. Usually the only way to kill an arcstrider is to splash damaged around them. If you directly block them, you should not be dying.
---
Literally the only reason why I chose a female hunter.
---
chief, i'm not even sure how you miss that its not referring to the enemy race
---
I was thinking mode about the weight distribution problem

---
All my characters are exos that either have one horn or two horns
---
Could never get high enough light level? If you use the power boost bounties you’re up to 640, and bergusia forge is only 650 power level. You can totally make it.
---
Thanks!
---
Wait what happened?
---
Pretty much. I only infuse weapons typically because they fully affect the gameplay. And even then, I dont usually do it every level unless I need to hit a delta for an activity like a new raid.
---
I have been infusing ever single power this season and Im sitting on well over 100 still. I have also masterworked more than just my main set. It's not hard to get cores. I have never even gone out if my way to get them either. Thats just unknowingly doing scrapper bounties, the occasional Matterweave, and dismantling legendary gear.
---
Like y1 gear could randomly drop 1-3 cores, why arent we doing objectives for bundles of cores? Lets say 2 spider ghosts for a normal one core bounty, so 6 ghosts for a bundle bounty, same as the powerful spider bounty, for Halloween we got a 7 core bounty for haunted forest? Wheres more of that? Like some of the powerful drops should automatically come with a core that would still only amount to what 11 cores, so that's like master working one weapon a given week lol
---
I felt so bad when a comp match crashed on me. Just Shaxx. Staring at me with angry dialogue to the side.
---
female awoken, make the best looking hunters. that's why i have one
---
Looks awesome! 
---
Though in a Destiny context, "Murder the Fallen" works just as well xD
---
A V E N G E  T H E  F DESTINY L L E N
---
Well they did just go out of the cabal invasion so they have to protect the tower and technically many guardians died, so potentially losing more to avenge one life seems like a bad trade
---
Wow. Just wow. Nice skills friend! That looks like something that'd make me have one of those hecc yeah moments. 
---
It's because you were using Jotunn.
---
How I do it is have a ranged weapon then got the opposite side of the ogres , 'snipe" them and then when the ogres die you wanna go to the top rock on that side for the final damage phase because it forces the thrall to come up one or two at a time not just all at once (if that makes any sense) load out is really just preference but just remember you can swap out weapons if need be 
---
Only way you're going to get better is if you play better people. And if you don't care about getting better then you shouldn't care about the games that you get :)
---
I know what you mean. I am having a lot of trouble with the thorn PvP step, as it is not only locked to crucible, it is locked to void or handcannons, which I rarely use.
---
That if it's the end piece if you're talking about right before you drop down then honestly super that part or hitting the ogres with the orb (if talking about that part) stuns them for a second or two I believe (again just to cover both parts)
---
I  know, people are so in their feelings and looking for something to blame in caydes death. It's really annoying to see everyone wishing Zavala acted on his gut reactions and strong feelings. He demonstrated why he's the vanguard commander, he makes the hard choices he even doesn't like. 
---
Yes, all weapons do I believe I've got a talons, bite and claws all a little over an hour ago
---
Thanks, got a bite!
---
Nice! (I was looking for another talons and actually got the one I wanted 😂)
---
One eyed mask 
---
Dies as it lived 
---
Stupid 
---
I didnt get the bite i wanted D; gota Keep grinding!
---
You may take that up with autocorrect 
---
F Ẏ L L E N
---
Doesn't leaving your main base of operations severely undermanned while in a rebuilding state make it a ripe target for attack? That's a way worse scenario, really. You can sacrifice foothold in other regions, but never in the Tower.
---
It might be hard to use but IMHO a special weapon -and a fustion rifle at that- shouldn't be able to 1 shot supers across the map without a drawback like Izanami's compressing 4 bullets into 1. 
---
Yeah, when he's not mugging, joking nigh constantly or quipping like an asshole, Cayde is one of the more impressive characters. Honestly, this whole Zavala/Drifter thing annoys me because I'd like to kill both of the smug fucks and see if they leave behind diaries/wills that were half as interesting as Cayde's.  Death definitely improved the latter and I bet it could do the same for those two.
---
You probably know, but you can't block chaos reach at all
---
Great and all, but why is he wearing that when he should be running dawnblade?
---
Bring back srl
---
I just got my first hammerhead yesterday, it had ambitious assassin and feeding frenzy
---
Mean while if a sentinel shield takes 2 bullets from an lmg i lose my ult. Idk why bungo hates sentinel so much
---
At this point i really think everyone should just stop posting stupid *bUnGiE pLeAsE* threads here and let the devs work on the game. Clearly they get confused by the wishes and desires of this subreddit.
---
As a dev; There's people happily paying &gt;500$, up to even &gt;2000$ and above per month on a chance to upgrade gear in other games.
---
People are totally going to buy that, even at 300 bucks.
---
Then you do not deserve to call yourself a guardian.
---
Don't worry, I don't have the money for that.
---
Happy for the OP to finally reach a common player base, but the message was written before he/she got fabled.  
---
But what do I know, I am just a mad asshole, right? Now kiss each other.
---
The helmet stayed on.
---
It *used to be* the name of the gun. For us players new to the series, calling it the QBB is needlessly confusing, especially since bows are a thing now.
---
kill random fallen until the loot drops, shouldn't be too hard. to unlock the forge after that, kill vex instead of fallen.
---
the box only gives you armor i believe, weapons only drop from the bosses
---
With destiny‘s rng leveling system tied to milestones, time invested has no effect on your progress
---
Haha my 6 month old little girl was very interested in my controller over the weekend while I was playing with her in my lap, which is why we got it. Ever tried getting void handcannon kills in Comp with a tiny human trying to pull the thumbstick off your controller? It's a gift for her as much as a gift for me at this point. 
---
That's what I said same gun now costs cores from collection?
---
if you have a friendly orpheus rig tether hunter, feel free to super away, just gotta remember to go pick up the orbs
---
Try entering the Konami code...no seriously, do it.
---
I mean I spend most of my destiny time in PvE content aswell. PvP just gets on my nerves too quick. Nothing beats the feeling that you have after beating a raid for the First time 
---
blueberries think if they stack 6 wells they get 6 times the buff
---
Ikora isn't bald, she has very short hair which is not unusual for black people. 
---
Do it in competitive. The thing is, if you’re &lt;500 glory nobody cares that you suck. Everyone is in the same boat. 
---
Or just grind it out in IB this week. You basically get double progress in Comp. I imagine it’d be the same for the IB bonus progress. 
---
We get to see Cayde with his hood off in one of the cutscenes at the start of Forsaken. It looks really weird after being so used to his hood always being on. 
---
Im still stuck at the strike for thorn
---
That’s really cool but shouldn’t it be 6 guardians?
---
Oh wow well done. I have done multi kills and 275/350 envoys (cheers telesto). Im only Mythic though plus im solo so work to done
---
I haven't gone back to the other two for pvp in a long while man.
---
except we only encourage invading, not add clearing or mote collecting
---
I'm at 700 light and well over half of my time is spent in crucible.  Including a large chunk of that in competitive; I never have fun in iron banner.
---
I don't know why, but IB is so annoying to play.  Almost on the level of Gambit.
---
I agree. Especially about Jotun and spectral blades. 
---
Nah it caps you at 700. Should’ve said up to 100
---
Gambit can be very fun if you luck out and get a team where they all know what they are doing, at least in my opinion.
---
Wait did you expand it at all?
---
Bungo pls nerf
---
Wait he sold one before?
---
|KEKSIS, THE BETRAYED|
---
despite having not forgotten and lunas you still post your rumble scores and farm karma by poat your missing exotics? Meh. 
---
After getting a luna’s howl, I prefer to use another weapon instead of a luna.
---
Double Cammy-Whammy
---
Honestly. I haven't played D2 but even D1's better-written expansions just weren't on the same level.
---
I’d argue that shoulder charge is pretty heavily countered in the current shotgun meta. I main Titan and I feel like I actually have to plan out a charge with everyone running around with shotguns.
---
Correct. Well worth a watch. Great cast. 
---
Don't nuke the boss there are two knights that spawn at the end that you'll need to kill first
---
“I need you to take this seriously, y’hear? Cause then I don’t have to.” —Cayde-6

Alright alright alright

Or literally anything cayde says

Awh damn. It’s hard enough to even stay alive. I get one shorted at light level 598.
---
Up up down down left right left right B A B A start
---
Happy B-day Darkened Wanderer
---
Countered by shotguns yes, but only shotguns. If you don't KNOW a Titan is coming around a corner even a recluse won't save you.
---
Personally I’m cool with how the Drifter acted. Maybe I wanna be the bad guy ;-;
---
Eris, get the rock off my map
---
I don't have time to explain what I don't have time to explain!
---
True. Wasn’t trying to discount your point about forcing you into a load out, but it’s probably the only thing on your list that actually has a regular counter.
---
Played a game last night. There was a spectral blade every 30 seconds. They super chained so damn hard. And it was on Convergence. So you can imagine the frustration of being spawn camped for 8 minutes
---
I just don't enjoy the entire concept of two different groups racing to finish a PvE encounter.  Even with the sprinkle of invasions I find it to be the most mind numbingly boring activity in the entire game.
---
No, Oryx did invade the Eliksni homeworld. I forgot the lore tab but it's about an ancient Fallen Kell crying out asking where the Traveler had gone, and then how how fought Oryx and was eventually taken
---
“If Bladedancers seem a little unfair it’s because they are. No room for honor in a fight.” —Cayde-6
---
This isn't new tho. You love pvp but you should know meta will always win. 
---
*TELL ME WHY*
---
Good for you! I'm hoping to get these + mountaintop this season, but I still need some medals and multi kills for the latter. I put my hopes on the new and improved Orewing's Maul for that, it seems decent enough to use effectively.
---
Badass man! What cloak is that?
---
That's infact true. I think the only weapons that cost cores are the ones that come masterworked, like Breakneck. 
---
Thank you! I never even thought about that at all. I’ll have to try it.
---
No meta exotics, just the same old trash. i've been using huckleberry as my ONLY gun exotic since the last fucking time XUR was selling it. i bought the game only when the base game was free and am really regretting it.   
---
everyone keeps saying oh use tractor cannon it's best on this activity or oh use one eyed mask or luna boots or whatever. guess what, i have none of that, just random garbage like ahamkara gloves or whatever it's called.   
---
   
---
i think my account must be glitched or whatever. either way i'm off to division 2, fuck this stupid lottery bullshit.
---
so you just block into it? Cause it looked like he swiped as it hit his shield
---
Whats the exotic perk?
---
You literally just brought up a scenario in which people would be suspicious. I’m saying that so much time has passed that no one cares if you have Luna’s Howl anymore since you’re bound to see it in most matches now. If you had Thorn on DAY ONE, it’s brand new and people would wonder how you had enough time to do the quest. Also the Thorn quest has nothing to do with being ‘good’. You don’t even need to play Crucible for the early steps of the quest. And it’s not like anyone lost progress for dying. So as long as you kept playing you’d eventually get it.
---
Thank you so much!! :)
---
Smh dude searchbar and youtube. 
---
Dismantle Mines, Yes!
---
Are you sure it was the same gun? Some weapons have year 1 and year 2 versions, like Nameless Midnight ot Antiope. Those count as different guns. You can miss that if your first assumption is a stupid one. 
---
We need a crucible game mode with no supers, no heavy, and with no 1 shot weapons. Like seasons 1-3, only better.
---
Just block .. btw it's me in that video
---
^(crush them (he whispered))
---
ok thanks bro! 
---
I think I might use this for some, thank you for the idea! 
---
I just got the Last Word ornament after I decided that I would prob never get the Last Word
---
Buddy and I were hunting the Corrupted Nightfall strike triumph (kill Sedia with 2 or less arc charges).  We stacked the difficulty our direction since we were duo, but it still came as a surprise when we melted her with the first shield break.  Completely avoided the ascendent realm portion of the strike at the end.
---
(Solar singe, Well, 1k voices/Jotunn.  She lasted about 2-3 seconds).
---
And I got Horror's Least 1/1.  Just need the stupid sparrow that won't drop for me to get the title.
---
Super dope
---
Is that a thorn ornament or is it just the lighting?
---
You have to use top tree arcstrider.
---
The recluse was by far the easiest pinnacle weapon to obtain, I already have mine and I haven't gotten any of the others. 
---
The hell is going on here
---
How’d you spend $100 trying to get an emblem you got for free from doing Cayde’s treasure maps?
---
? it works well. Shoot them first then switch to the other weapon and finish them.
---
HBD and that's a very "Dredgen-ie" Hunter there.  Nicely done.
---
Ding! DING!!! DiNg!!!
---
Let's see if we can hit the 700 upvote mark!
---
Nnnnnnow I see it says “dodging near enemies”.....fuck my brain.
---
Guess I should say I never felt like enemy proximity mattered. Glad to know I’m just dumb and now I understand how it works. Newer to Hunter still. Thanks guardian 
---
Your hunter looks amazing holy crap. I wish mine could look like that well done. Happy cake say :) 
---
Yep totally! I think it’s a hard thing to get right however, so props to you for being able to do it
---
That moment when you have a scroll wheel for L1
---
Technically didn't though. Vanguard was rallying other lightless guardians, fixing vex teleporters, storming the city etc. while drifter was shooting down his crew
---
Again, the vanguard has had our backs way more than just one or two times
---
I wasn’t awake when this got posted and since it’s gotten popular I’ll leave it up. But, achievement posts must be in the weekly thread and no where else. Thank you. 
---
What cloak is that it looks so good? 
---
Agreed
---
It's for skating bro, get with the times. Lol
---
I get it the cabal are bad people who bad things.
---
I hope he found Ace
---
yeah me too
---
I use the hammerhead as a 2nd invasion gun because I usually use Jotunn
---
so Quickdraw comes handy. should I use a Rampage spec on it?
---
Does it require 3 enhancement cores to add milk and another 2 for a spoon?
---
Ahh I see its for the new hunter skate my bad
---
Haven't done T2, but yesterday got an Outlast (pulse rifle) from a T3 run, so weapons are definitely still dropping.
---
You will but as far as rewards are concerned tied to it will stay unlocked.
---
Every day is cake day
---
I have B bound to my boo-boo barrier when I'm playing Titan. 
---
I'm pretty sure a few have been banned, we won't really hear of bans. But you could be correct. Destiny 2 has become stale for me. Comp is stressful and the game is just more of a chore now. But I still keep up to date with the game. I may try this and the report back if I have been banned. 
---
Glad that hasn’t happened to me lol
---
That's what the yellow turbo switch does, gives any class a Y1 Titan jump. 
---
If you trying to get the "get people with higher light while under the burden, the big issue now is everyone is using it so it created a reverse arms race to the bottom.
---
Easy way to obliterate your light is to wear armor from Tess its light is level 10, doesnt take much to fall to like 300 light
---
Ha yeah sorry I meant Melee, dodge on the brain! 
---
Don't worry about it many people make the same mistake. It's confusing as the gun reload doesn't need enemies nearby so you assume it works the same way. 
---
found the Arc Warlock, the evil one.
---
It's premature bitching, honestly. Their rationale for moving to bounties is to make core acquisition more deterministic, which means that most people probably weren't getting as many cores from Scrapper bounties as they anticipated. And given that they were already fairly generous, the bounties could be a good step up if they give enough. 
---
I believe 660+.
---
So there IS a way to out do the orbs made by nightstalkers. 
---
Lies! Cayde is dead, this man is an imposter!
---
That's part of the problem.  If you have any of the ib consumables that increase your light by 100 for 30 minutes,  pop that. 
---
You might still get stomped but at least you can kill someone easily because you're higher light. 
---
All I need is the ghost shell still :(
---
I know. I relived that horror yesterday on my new character 
---
I never really liked the allegiance quest. If it were real, I wouldn't go against the drifter or stand by him unless I had enough information, and taking his side could also be a deceptive way of gaining more information regarding him, so if I wanted to side with the vanguard, I would actually side with the drifter and cross him if he reveals malicious intentions.
---
I've completed some of the power level increase quests and that helped, and the more I play the easier has been getting. 
---
Is there a specific event that drops the consumables or are they just random drops?
---
I guess I'm the only hunter that doesn't have Shards of Galanor :(
---
It's from the Halloween event called Festival of the Lost. It's specifically called Skerren Corvus Cloak. 
---
"Bank those Motes" should sound better.
---
Oh I’d take that role for sure. Nice. How can I farm another if it depends on Ada’s weapon frame LMG quest becoming available? Or is there another way?
---
If the pictures were making fun of Nike, totally. But this is making a joke on the endgame posters “avenge the fallen”, so maybe not this time. 
---
Actually, I think someone already did “bank those motes”.  Might be a while back though
---
That's because they were looking too far into the future with them things.
---
Hmm, I'll have to give it a try. Thanks.
---
I agree with everything besides the Shoulder Charge and Jotunn. Shoulder Charge goes thru people half the time I use it. Also people seem to thing that Jotunn has like Truth levels of tracking, it doesn't. I use Jotunn in PvP cause I am a garbage human being lmao but the amount of shots I miss on people just because they sidestepped as I fired it at them. Honestly I would say that Spectral Blades, Shotguns and Point and Click Coil are the biggest issues in PvP rn. Just my two cents, im not a hardcore PvP player tho.
---
Before the new season, I got a lot of Simulation Seeds from spider (legendary shards) and turned them in to Vance. I ended up getting a lot of ECs from that as I did it almost everyday. Plus you’ll get back a lot of legendary shards from dismantling things. 
---
Give me that Blast Furnace already....
---
I mean I still found me and my fireteam trying to blow through that story mission as fast as possible hoping there was a secret way to save him if you did it in a certain time or something🤷🏿‍♂️
---
It needs a bigger nerf. It's an insane amount of healing.
---
What happened is the other reddit went on a big riot asking for cheaper enhancement cores, to the point where bungie had to do something about it. So they did the passive aggressive move they usually do. They pretended to give in while keeping the system pretty much exactly the same.
---
Not too long ago they upped the spawn rate of the meatball boss in gambit, but made it so it doesn't give the malfeasance quest 100% of the time. So that people that were weren't getting the malfeasance quests still have the same chance to get it. It's the same logic. 
---
Basically when the community cry about stupid issues, bungie find stupid solutions.

Havent played in a few weeks, how is that going to impact my Exalted Blade?

Woot woot!

Never understood why people wanted to stomp on QP I understand wanting to play QP with friends but if you want to try hard with your buddies go play Comp because that’s what it’s for QP is supposed to be chill mindless crucible

Cayde-6 was my absolute favorite character in the game.  If you check out your Guardian's interesting with him in D2, when you liberate the tower Zavala and Ikora just stand with their backs to you but Cayde-6 congratulates you and is the one to beckon Hawthorne to join you all.  Not Ikora, not Zavala, Cayde-6.
---
He was the goofy, fun, lovable jokester that we needed.  Whenever his story mission comes up in the Vanguard playlist, I play it and cry...

Solo competitive is a trash can which should be avoided like a plague
---
Nice, another "Please read the patch notes for me" post
---
Honestly, I ONLY play solo. I do strikes, gambit, but lots of exploring the world and grinding daily/weekly quests. I love the game. I played it when it first came out and picked it back up on my PC when it became free, like you did. I totally think you can play solo, no questions asked. I do suggest keeping an eye out for a sale on the Forsaken DLC. It's totally worth it, season pass is more for people who really want to grind to full light level and beyond. 
---
Totally worth it in 2019, super fun and polished game. Keep an eye out for Forsaken on sale (which is pretty often) - you're paying 20-30 bucks for all those DLC's to tack on to an already free game. It's totally justifiable. 
---
Thank you!

Unless they route the entire website from there, it's pointless for individual use.

Phoenix Protocol is the last exotic I need except for the Arbalest or what ever it's called.  I've gotten Vesper Radius twice in the last week.  But no Phoenix.

Okay

Ah crap. Good thing I hoarded a bunch, but still.
---
Heck yeah 
---
I'm just playing competitive so I can finally complete the Luna's Howl quest, It'll certainly take me ages doing it solo but it sure is possible if I keep on pushing through
---
As someone who has used Jotunn im PvP I can say that it is fairly luck based tbh,  like the tracking is pretty garbage most of the time. 
---
I think it's not talked about cuz it's pretty common knowledge
---
Yea lol
---
So whats the matter? Would you rather: Have 3 really fudging op supers or A SINGLE HELMET thats good in pvp? 
---
"I dont defend hunters". Thats exactly what you  are doing. Who gives a shit about diversity if all of their ults are stronger BOTH in pvp and pve. (Tether, BB, GGun, Any Arc subclass, Spectral Blades). Lemme just get a bit of rng and acquire myself some really sweet and juicy Gwisin and decimate anyone that doesnt play this game as a hunter/25 hours a day. I really dont care about diversity as long as everything is balanced between classes. Its like if I wanna go any pve activity I can use any of the 3 classes, but for pvp its just the guy with the 3 min phantom ult. I have an ideea for the next nerf: Dont touch guns, only the armor. The guns are balanced between theirselves and are good as they are, even if Nf or Lunas are superior you can at least counter them. The main problem is that it all sits on top of a spectral blades no brainer.
---
Honestly the only reason I have ever tried to play comp is because I wanted these guns(LH/NF) because I like the gun models But it’s not gonna happen for me.  I top out around 800. I wish I could get a LH or NF without the magnificent houl perk but I would understand the guns are cool because they are rare.  Good luck to everyone out there trying ! 
---
Yes! Absolutely! I did a few months ago and really happy I got back into Destiny. Sitting here at work going through Reddit just thinking about grinding the weekly reset is fun!

I would just make titan for that.

The first image is a scene from Titanic, and a lot of people complain both of the characters in the scene could have fit on the door and lived.

My mom made me now the lawn in the middle of my first raid 🙃 never got to finish it. 
---
Is... Is this loss!?
---
That'd be nice. Huge amount of already existing gear that's kind of just sitting there at the moment.
---
*why balance? Newer hand canon more damage!*
---
I think it should run locked loadouts like in prestige raids. Change the meta. Make a week of scout rifles sidearms and linear fusion rifles. Possibly could add in solar subclass only ect. I feel it would give a nice change of rhythm and force people who are overly comfortable with the meta and allow those who hide in the shadows with less desirable weapons as there go to shine in the light of shaxxs praise. 
---
Fair enough, I wish you luck on your journey.

This has been added to the subs rules as well.

So the answer to your question is, well, quite a lot of people.

But please don't think I'm having a go, just doing my best to make this sub better for everyone. I'd be happy to allow your post if you can get a real screenshot.

Have a good day Guardian!

It’s far too expensive for them
---
I think my game is bugged i keep getting 698 drops ive got 3 lvl700 weapons and all my armor is 698/699
---
Man I didn't even realize that was a thing!  That sounds awesome tbh
---
It could be nice for old-time-sake. But these locations aren’t currently relevant to the plot anymore. Even if we did go back we would probably go to A different area like how we have the EDZ in D2 as opposed to the cosmodrome in D1. 
---
But another thing they totally could and should do is bring back more D1 pvp maps to D2. 
---
intriguing...i too am a titan and i mostly just dont know how to help. ill give this a try.

I know 100% that I received a "Notorious" +3 perk armor drop after a Tier 2 completion (this is before I ever tried Tier 3). Understand this is NOT what I got from collecting loot at the end... I was finishing my weekly reckoning bounty and that was my Powerful Gear reward which dropped at soon as we killed the T2 boss. Think it's pretty damn rare, but possible. Wasn't a helmet either, think it was leg armor.

Shoulders aren't big enough!

If you do an account recovery, so then someone else plays on your account on their system, then there really isn't anything they can do to stop you. No proof that you aren't the one signing in, or anything like that.
---
Theoretically, they could look to see where you normally log in at, and compare it to this different log in location.. but that is a long shot (at best). I fly with my xbox all the time due to work, and so do a lot of people.. So trying to nail someone due to location wouldn't work very well.. if at all.
---
If that person does something like DDOS, etc then it would come back on you, since that activity is tied to your account.
---
But to directly answer your point: They do not have a problem if you pay for a carry.. They might think it is sad that you can't find a group willing to play with you (for free), but they can't stop you from spending money for a group. In contrast, they probably DO have a problem if you pay for someone to do an account recovery would consider it an offense, but there really isn't anything they can do about it. So they are probably more focused on bigger targets (like network manipulation, etc).
---
The biggest risks when handing over your account when paying for a service is that you just gave them a ton of information (credit card info, etc), and anything negative / illegal they do in those games will come right back on you.
---
There are a lot of reputable sites out there. So if you're going to do it, I'd recommend one with a legit website. You'll pay more, but it is an option. A buddy of mine bought his Luna's for $350 USD (in that range) from destiny2raiding.com. He doesn't regret doing it.

Uh, lunas and NF came out before mountaintop..that was only last season.
---
Are you okay, dude? 
---
What do you mean? it's not raining...
---
I don’t see what the problem is. Everyone is out of enhancement cores? Where are they all going? It’s a limited resource which means the mechanic of highest light level of all in your inventory and vault is calculated into your next drop, people SHOULD NOT be infusing EVERY piece of gear they get. Hold onto it, in your inventory. Save up your cores.
---
I am a casual player and don’t play as often as I used to and can still afford to infuse once every two weeks. I hit 700 (in my inventory) but not my main gear. It’s a lesson in patience. Without the cores in the infusing process we’d have maxed out tier 3 gambit bois and iron banner would be a shitshow. I don’t understand players backing this complaint as I AM a casual player and still manage my inventory properly. There are mechanics in place for a reason. Why have your max light level increased from gear in your inventory? Because you aren’t supposed to infuse everything. It’s about choice and patience. 
---
nope, the Praxic Order not the Vanguard. They aren't the same.
---
I'm a hunter boi and this is the "Scrub swatter" WELCOME TO JACKASS!

Yea but now down an entire planets worth of royal wine

I did nothing but lose last night in iron banana BECAUSE NO ONE CAPTURE ZONES, I played defensively kept a 1.5+ kd with usually about 10 captures and finished the pvp part of my thorn quest.  I would have been pissed but I was murdering people probably going for the gun with a -100 light mod on.
---
Keep it coming these are good
---
If its eater or scourge then yeah haha
---
You just amn't have context enough

Yes, please lmao

Yes, never mentioned in post. Invader applies quite heavily as well many people with that armor are ready to get kills.

I don't care if it's reckoning void singe, if you're the only teams warlock please use well for healing, especially with attrition active. I've not had a single fireteam get across that bridge once so far.

Happy cake day

Eventually the community will readjust I guess. Just hoping to expedite the process.
---
These people sound like bums without jobs or school. Or a actual life schedule. Raid time is usually dinner time for 90% of my clan. It’s normal to be doing human things lol. 
---
O HO.
---
Pardon me, I was absorbed in thought, Guardian. 
---
Congrats 
---
How about everyone stops thinking they can invade and be LMG trashcans? Just because you farmed an invader set doesn't mean you should be invading. Im out here rocking not forgotten and a sniper with 101 flawless, and i have to fight a couple idiots for the portal because I'm actually playing the game mode.  
---
Seriously i couldn't ccount how many games i kill the most ads, deposit the most motes, kill 15 to 20 guardians, and do the most primeval damage amd still lose. This is why solo gambit is a joke. In prime you are more likely to time out the match than some of blue berries getting their shit together, not activating dps phases before images, then dying moments later, and running any thoughtful setup.

All right, all right, all right, let's see what we've got:

Worth noting I’m on PC I def couldn’t have gotten the kill off that quick when I was playing on Xbox
---
But I’m still proud of the shot thx fam 
---
If we meet in crucible, I will run from you, hide from you, and you'll still kill me
---
Right. And idk why people can't see that asking for infusion to be alittle easier doesn't mean we'll progress any faster. It just means we'll have less aggravation and have more fun while doing it. Is that really so much to ask?
---

If you have dinner come up during a Destiny raid, that’s either poor planning on your part or your team should go back to the kiddie pool.

I love how everytime two people dont agree somebody has to throw out elitism. Its even more rampant in this game community. I mean if that excuse helps you sleep at night then I cant stop you. Doesnt mean youre not wrong though. Because you are. People keep crying infusion is a problem. If you actually gave a fuck to care though, it wouldnt be. Simple as that. Not elitism. Just common sense conservation of materials you know can be pretty scarce. Dont have a lot? Dont fucking infuse everything. You earn enough easy cores every week to bring gear up your main gear while playing. So if it really kills you that you have to spend 2 weeks not looking the same to point where we need a mega thread on Reddit, then just dont infuse every thing. Dont infuse every powerful. Save it in your inventory until you get +5 or higher. Hell I save until I hit max. Who cares if I dont look good for a couple weeks? Im leveling. The point is to get through it with what you got. Its not a hard concept. This community is just lazy and plain stupid. Just like with Niobe Labs. People went crazy and bitched that they didnt have time to go on a thread or stream and suggest a solution. When in reality, if everybody who complained, used that time to instead suggest a solution, it would have been beaten much sooner. You have the time to type a complaint, you have the time to type a possible solution. But you point that out and youre the elitist 1% who can sit and play all day. If you think thats an exaggeration, it isnt. Thats literally what the communtiy was saying. Thats how braindead this community is. Its easier to complain, than it is to think. And hardly anybody who plays Destiny likes to think. Same with Niobe Labs, same with Cores.
---
I have no idea how to get the achievement of don't user supers on this section (whole party).  maybe with the Minotaur's have 2 dues with ikelos, time your grenades, and make sure someone is picking off the snipers.... maybe but that would still be shit at section 4+ because it goes straight nuts. 
---
Easy there satan
---
Oh, you have a +15 invader set? Would be shame if someone in green-yellow gear invaded instead...
---
good enouth to be on r/sbubby
---
I promise you this shits a common thing if you're lfging, just watch out for it. Raid report to see if they've already done flawless, talk to them like you don't know (to see if they rly wanna help or wanna ruin shit), any communication/gameplay signals pointing towards them acting like they need the flawless, or that they don't care enough, kick em, if it's a flawless run that everyone needs, everyone should be serious and somewhat nervous, even for each other, showing signs of unity. Basically manipulate the conversation to expose them. That one time literally put me off of petras run until I had nothing left to do, so when I started back again I started doing this shit and exposed 3 guys in the many fireteams I've been with. You can tell when they literally feel and talk as if nothing happend or with just anger talking shit as you tell them you're kicking them cuz they already have flawless, which is the final test. Hate to have to do all this but I hate to see people go through what I did by similar people who have the spare time to fuck over people they don't even know, over the internet, by stating at a screen and holding a controller. Like what does that accomplish especially in a petras run which tends to be lengthy for 1st timers. Is a 8 sec laugh by pissing people off worth 1-2 hrs of fake playing to set up the joke at riven... People are just wierd man 
---
You are welcome!

‘‘Tis the onion bro

You lost 32 motes while your teammates zero. Don't blame a 3-stack when the obvious reason you lost is because you didn't know what you were doing
---
This is all incredibly ill-researched. While I agree that we'd all like to see armor from year-1 have perks, they didn't have them at launch. I played this game every day almost during year 1 and I still have armor from the 1st year in my vault, and at no point were there perks on these sets. The ONLY armor that had something related to perks throughout year 1 was the raid sets because of the raid-exclusive mods that you could swap out.

Well there’s not much to do like you’re looking for before they go on sale. I don’t know how often they’re on sale but when you buy them you get a consumable increase to PL500 and you do what a i said before. For things to do until then, nothing will affect it once you use that seed
