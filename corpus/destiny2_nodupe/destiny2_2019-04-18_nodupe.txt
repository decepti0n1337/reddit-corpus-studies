If you're trying to incite I'm being contradictory for my comment, you're making no sense. You're not offering an opinion. If you had just commented saying you think it's the best thing to happen in PvP, that'd be giving your opinion. Saying 'oh shut the fuck up' is just fucking stupid

IKR absolutely no respect for the dead

Don‚Äôt take it to school or work to show your colleagues lol...

I‚Äôm playing on console. Backup mag only adds one round. Doesn‚Äôt seem worth it.

This is hilarious but I'm personally enjoying Destiny 2 way more than I did the first one.
---
This is me for escalation protocol (still no shotgun), I've been pretty lucky with blind well though
---
The chest by itself with bloody tooth as the shader isn't half bad.
---
That's not why they're mad. It's because they chalk up the work of a 200 man team and gave sole credit to her. Although some of it has to do with people being afraid of a woman doing science lmao

Thanks! Now I just need to grind out the quest steps, but at least I don't need to worry about winning anymore.

You might want to use the Devour tree for the melees...i finished it easy with that...

I saw this image on the Apex Legends page before, and thought: Awe, her first win (and... how the hell did that laptop run Apex).

---
I just saw this image now, and thought: Wow, she plays Destiny too...
---
oh, wait..
---
I ordered the last word awhile back, should I have gotten it yet?
---
Technically they haven‚Äôt made any new ones recently, just bringing sexy back
---
Queenbreakers Bow, it was the first linear fusion to exist. I had tens of thousands of kills with it, it was my baby. Then they brought it back as a heavy and heavily modified it from the original.

Can you see my comment?

To what end though? Are you going to want a not forgotten and a mountain top etc? I understand wanting to have the lore for the triumphs but at that point you wouldn't be happy until you had them all and that's clearly hard to attain. Not saying don't try to get someone to carry you but I don't think it's worth worrying about!

Thnx

Pure RNG. I still never got the sniper rifle after months.

its not real :0 its a meme

Wait so it it supposed to say vidoc?

The reckoning matchmaking is so broken.  The timer will start and no one else is there. Then one guy will join with like 3:30 left. Then you both stare at each other like, well should we even bother?

if halo is second priority idk if your word can be trusted...
---
&gt;Hey hey hey, kid, you. Look you know that ramen shop? Best in town, trust me I know. I helped them get set up, see. Used to be in the old tower, I greased some palms and got them here. Everyone loves me for it, not like they don't already but you get it.
---
Just like when they nerfed bottom tree striker!
---
RIP
---
And the "buff" to bottom tree failed spectacularly to the point where it's worse than before.
---
Thats awesome and old but tell an old man please what the f**k is Clout?
---
It didn't get repetitive?
---
This is where the words ‚Äúfriends‚Äù comes in. Halo 2 is where my transition to shooters began and it will always be the best in the regards of shooters (IMO). But the memories I made with my friends and family in Destiny 1 is what makes it the game I would love to relive with all of them again.
---
Oh they nerfed Titan
---
Yeah but it gives you over an eighth of your super back if you land it
---
The fact that this is in comp means bungie gives zero fucks about pvp
---
Ehroar and Aztecross incoming for pound town action.
---

---
Bottom tree got nerfed wtf?
---
Go into Gambit with three masterwork weapons and just mow shit down and let the team grab the motes. 
---
Make sure you get the double kills and if you're a warlock then run top tree nova bomb with Skull... make it rain orbs.
---
Love punch. Just want punch. Need make punch punch again

I'm surprised I haven't seen that yet in the meme rotation.

I‚Äôll make it eventually üòÖ

Not my fault you are a simpleton. And whose angry now? You have played yourself.

I could go for Luna‚Äôs on my own but I don‚Äôt have the time right now. If I could find someone willing to help me for free though
---
Looks like 7 enhancement cores to me...
---
If you‚Äôre into pulses Right Side of Wrong is a really good weapon to use since it‚Äôs basically a solar Go Figure.
---
It's made to drop shields in REGULAR play, anything with a modifier is NOT regular play, especially if that modifier is for Matched shields.
---
Never had the chance or seen. But I would doubt it can't
---
ok
---
93% way through.  It's been a long journey. Hardest part is to remember to keep it equipped when turning in bounties when not using it.
---
Im just saying that it‚Äôs not one area that it‚Äôs bad in. It‚Äôs fun, but when the perk reads ‚Äòfire slugs that cause massive damage to elemental shields of enemy combatants, you expect it to take down the shield. It doesn‚Äôt do that in the one endgame activity that it should work for. If it‚Äôs dps was good to make up for it, then it‚Äôd be better, but now there‚Äôs no reason to use a Kinetic LINEAR FUSION RIFLE over Ace.
---
I did the same but with Fusion grenades and ashen wake on bottom tree. A lot of fun honestly.
---
Ok but still there is literally no reason on running other than the facts it looks cool.
---
I was doing this just on personal preference this entire time and I was wondering what people were complaining about. That's such a crazy bug!
---
They really need to change it to where you ready up.
---
Lmfaooo
---
Makes a song using only the note/scales/chords of F.
---
That was a painful read.
---
So damn lucky! The one armour set I couldn‚Äôt get! Wish the event would come back so I could finish it and get the legendary setüôè
---
100% agree. Nothing I hate more than having this happen, only to immediately die upon spawn before uneven have control of my character because they are literally RIGHT THERE.
---
Maybe at the end of y2
---
idk man, when bungie previously raised level cap from 600 to 650, handicap multiplier didn't change. they must have decided that the extra 50 levels are too easy so this season they raised cap by 50 but multiplier only works at 100 light debuff and up. so it's back to initial forsaken levels now unless i'm mistaken

Cerberus is probably my favorite auto rifle. Not that I use auto rifles but 4 simultaneous precision hits feels damn good
---
Can someone explain this episode oh TFPoB to me? I remember it as Alfred stealing everything but that can‚Äôt be right... right?
---
Revelry awards players who do the event with buffs. I personally agree it‚Äôs dumb these buffs carry into PvP but, it gives you an incentive to play the event and be able to do these kinds of things.
---
Thanks, I'll use this link Friday night
---
How pissed do you have to be to make that many mistakes?
---
I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs going on but I‚Äôve seen ALOT of these random things where things don‚Äôt spawn properly or doors don‚Äôt open for abit when you‚Äôve killed the trigger......
---
The grind honestly is not difficult. It took me maybe 5 hours, just in strikes and the event. The buff system is really fun in PVE, but should not exist in PVP. Not a great time to PVP currently...
---
I‚Äôd like more exotic side arms
---
I actually have a concept in my file called the predator.
---
r/yuri
---
There was a sidearm that completed the fallen set called "dregs promise" apparently it wasn't that well liked/used tho
---
So true, Even down to that guy at the end trying to high five at nobody. We all see THAT GUY somewhere throwing that high five emote around
---
My first run ended at around 80-90, I was surprised to took over just an hour. Man time flew fast when it was fun.
---
*Laughs in Chromatic Fire*
---
Oke they are 4. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
4 for what? there are 3 subclass.
---
I'm on PC and just had the shotty to drop. I'd be happy to share some luck with you sometime!
---
I had one in the postmaster today! Was carrying a 2 Tailed Fox.  Got a fucking 2 Tailed Fox.
---
It summons instantly too!
---
It's not the infinite forest, it's the Infinitely Repeating Forest. It's trivial.
---
that's suck lol especially it's very exciting to see Exotic engram at the post master but I got Borealis the day after that so I was happy!
---
No, you don't use heavyweight.
---
Yeah the whole situation aggravated me that pvp alone can dictate the rest of the game for us, and after restarting 4 times from scratch in the dev process i kinda gave up on the game and people will say "well the game got better with updates" im am absolutely tired of hearing that, its just an excuse for laziness and in my opinion the gaming industry should die if the expectations get lowered to the point where we get promised a bacon cheeseburger and at launch we get handed half of the bun and an uncooked patty and were expected to get everything else down the road IF they get around to it.
---
Kill it with kindness, it will be rewarding in due time trust me!
---
I think gladd got to 400 or somewhere around there
---
But you can't access the forest, can you?
---
Me likey
---
Thanks man. Got LM in the first 10 frames. Now sits in my vault. Lol.
---
Ok, Guess I‚Äôm lucky cuz I only came across Two NFS in my crucible lifetime.
---
Nice clip mate. But I think that just shows perfectly why ults are so broken on a pvp base. As soon as you pop your ult you have nothing to worry about. Don't get me wrong, ults should be broken, that's the idea behind them, but still be somewhat reasonable. This poor soul had no chance in this situation. He could have done NOTHING to outplay you. And this is where I think it starts ruining the experience. You see more and more people just jumping of maps, because they have nothing to counter such a overtuned roaming ult. And I don't talk about spectral, I talk about almost every roaming ult in this game. They last to long and have to much damage reduction plus the dodge/mobility bonuses on many of them, and/or the ability to become undamagable is just not leaving any space for counterplay. 
---
Sincerely an a little bit frustrated Hunter, who wrote this way to long post just to let some steam of. Sorry to the sentry, didn't want to talk down your post. Have a nice day...
---
Hey what platform? I‚Äôve been solo grinding for 3 seasons for Luna‚Äôs and I‚Äôm pretty close. Going in with at least one person might help!
---
My first legendary was a Badger CCL scout rifle. It has triple tap and truesight, and it was my favorite guns to use. I used it throughout the entire game because it suited my play style so perfectly. In D2 it‚Äôs just whatever exotic is currently meta
---
Anyone got a active clan ? Need people to play with
---
#i want to look like this
---
Firefly has nothing to do with outlaw.
---
Looking like a fuckin block. A good looking block
---
DeSTinY 2 BAd
---
Fuck out of my whispers? The hell does that mean? lol
---
Mostly process of elimination. For me, the weapon mods that make sense to apply in PvE are backup mag or the damage spec mods (minor/major/boss/Taken) because they are the ones that directly increase DPS. As we said, backup mag is out, and of the damage spec mods minor spec makes the most sense for this gun‚Äôs role as an ad clearer. Sure, you‚Äôll pop thralls, dregs, etc in one hit, but minor spec would give you more oomph against beefier red bar knights, minotaurs, etc.
---
That being said, I assumed that you‚Äôd want to use this almost exclusively in PvE. If you‚Äôre going to use it in PvP or are just looking for an ease of use mod, then there are PvP focused mods like freehand grip and Icarus that could work, but hard to give advice on that because it comes down to your personal playstyle.
---
Don't know what you were expecting.
---
I‚Äôd wear that
---
I made this comment to go from 69 to 70
---
Thank you.
---
Y‚Äôall complaining about skip granades, y‚Äôall forgot handheld supernovas?
---
Have you seen it in last wish? It fucking shreds
---
You really think 3 runs is enough? Even though you can you‚Äôd need human sacrifice for it to happen
---
Yeah I got 4 blues in a row with dive planetary materials
---
I‚Äôm not sweaty but I voop shotgun rushers, I‚Äôve gotten more than a few nice messages
---
I think he wants someone to tell what a god roll on hazard of the cast is?
---
Destiny 1 was incredible through rose tinted glasses. I put an insane amount of time in, but to play it today would really show the flaws.
---
The only viable shoulder charges I ever get are with Stand Asides and picking off stragglers who stray from the pack. Otherwise it's someone with DRB who softly chuckles and gives me a "lol k" before watching my sprinting corpse do a front flip.
---
So satisfying to watch an invader sprint towards your team with thunderlord and give 'em the old "Bitch you thought."
---
Take this big serious F. I was in your shoes before and I was suffering through Dark Souls with it ;-;
---
Yes it‚Äôs almost as op as recluse but the grind is a lot harder than the 21% delirium
---
If you want useful information you should probably put more effort into your post.
---
I think at this point I will do anything for enhancement cores.  
---
  
---
*anything...*
---
You realize you're saying we should all be able to screw each other out of heavy ammo right.... I can tell you just like being able to cheat people when you want to.
---
Honestly should have had a /s at the end there, was replying to the previous guy about hunters not having the same option. But I agree with you. The ability to screw over the people you are supposed to see as allies is bull crap
---
Do bergusia
---
Well Grandma Eva is probably a little lonely so...
---
I know what that is, but he literally just posted a playing card and Bob Ross.
---
Gotcha man, no harm done.
---
Hunters should be able to team kill....
---
Welp, insulted a mod. Kids in deep shit now.
---
Yeah got to say this is a very lacking post
---
U can't comment 4 shit. GTFO of the Reddit's noob

Pretty cancer to emote on a guy you killed 1v1 with a super... üôÑ
---
I have edited my comment.
---
You can abuse other stuff, too. You don't need to be a skip grenade to compete.
---
Can't watch the vid right now
---
same. I used 575 yesterday after i got the arbalest and got all blues.
---
This fucking setup thrashed me two games, the lion guy just never dies or runs out of ammo, he just picks a hallway and deems it uninhabitable
---
With zen moment it actually has some of the best range for an auto around, you can laser beam a shreeker with this thing from far. Maybe you should try an pulse rifle then since you keep turning down everybody‚Äôs suggestions
---
Pulses are dogshit i think i might get misfit now
---
Or top tree class ability boost
---
‚ÄúNinja VANISH‚Äù
---
Did you try the code in the OP?
---
I actually feel scummy doing this in comp. but anything to counter nade spam that is these 3 weeks.
---
Well of radiance warlock, infinite grenades, you can run around spamming blessings on your team and basically playing off tank healer support like it's a moba or something now &lt;3
---
Ive already decided my loadout from the one guy that actually gave insane advice on my other post.
---
Where do I use the code
---
It's the Blacklight Razor, an exotic warmind sparrow.
---
Pshh, there's nothing scummy about using what's strong. This is the game right now. If people want something more reserved R6Siege exists and csgo is free.
---
And my counter thay has always been if you're good at something, really good at it, you can over come changes and still win.
---
As for PvE, that isn't true. There are weapons that work better against certain bosses. There are raid groups that will kick you or not invite you if you don't have the proper gear.  
---
Again, all nerfs come from PvP because they are the loudest group in any community. This has been going on since online game became popular.
---
I'm baffled that someone downvoted you for this.
---
Lol.  I'm so broken up!
---
Lol. No worries.
---
To 2%.
---
Much appreciated! I‚Äôll look into them as options. Thank you
---
Bruh I don‚Äôt know what clip you watchin, it uses hella energy to block while in the arcstaff super. They seem balanced to me, but you‚Äôre entitled to whatever opinion you want.
---
Blacklight Razor is correct! Monochromatic shader.
---
Fuck your toaster and your furnace
---
Sorry to sound like an ass. But yeah I thought misfit initially was equivalent of an SMG but once I got that zen moment my whole prospective changed. Anyways good luck on finding what you need
---
I agree. I preferred Haunted because I just really like the atmosphere of it, but I've really enjoyed both the graphical and gameplay concepts Bungie has going for the Revelry.
---
Your goal of...Not wanting it?
---
You're like: Bye, have a great time lol
---
No
---
I'm sure there are.  It's just easier to play the game without communication, unless I'm paying with people I know.
---
I'm on the same boat
---
That's not how it works. They couldn't make it not apply to every game type, they didn't decide "let's fuck up competitive more" that's ridiculous
---
Definitely work for me PvE
---
Baseball?
---
r/badfaketexts
---
Damn, should've waiting until Saturday to post!
---
Dude it's a new game it's not like they could have just given you every exotic from the get go. If you wanna have all your d1 exotics back just play d1. Some exotics are important to the lore (sleeper, thorn, ace, tlw, etc.) So ofc they're gonna be brought back, but there are plenty of completely new ones in d2.
---
Hmm, maybe I'll try it sometime
---
It's a pretty good loadout, to be fair.
---
Im actually rewatching firefly while I play D2 because of this
---
This is exactly we didnt have chat on PC at launch. Bungie wanted the social interaction to be neutral at worst.
---
Seriously I hate those people. How small your dick has to be if you have to be a jerk in a video game when someone compliment you.
---
We all enjoy the same hobby.. Can we leave drama to real life please...
---
Make sure to watch a video first, I haven't completed it but the jumping part is quite a puzzle and takes some practice to get right. To be honest I suck at sniping and my buddy got tired of falling to his death so we quit and haven't tried since.
---
I wiped a team with the Chaperone and a guy whispered me mid-game and said, "stop aping idiot."
---
So I switched to TLW and Persuader (sniper rifle) and immediately sniped his ass, just seconds after he sent the message. I whispered back, "this better?"
---
He blocked me, lmao
---
I have no idea how long "a while" is, but mainly what you've missed are holiday events (Crimson Days for Valentine's Day, Dawning for Christmas, etc.) Right now there is an Easter holiday event called The Revelry. 
---
Despite persistent rumours that this is the case, new activities people pay money for don't get taken away arbitrarily. Assuming you mean annual pass things when you ask if there's any content from this season you should catch up on. I am quite frankly amazed **anyone** buys the annual pass considering everyone seems to think it'll be taken away for no reason. It won't be. It's all here to stay.
---
I played against a punter running jemini jesters, invis dodge and had the class ability tonic active. You were never safe. Every corner and door was a trap. You had 1/2 a second of radar to get his location before you were disoriented. 
---
Strong player, but damn. I‚Äôd rather play against grenade spam than be blind and disoriented the whole time. Atleast I know where the grenades are coming from.
---
A month and a half I meanr
---
Agreed
---
I mean, bows are the easiest weapons so I thought you were joking. Anyone's good with em.
---
Definitely me after I got my Luna
---
Remember it's supposed to show a close up of the NPC.
---
Need an oyster shucjer
---
If I could just get one piece of crotas end armor again ......
---
It does!
---
Pro tip, you can stand on top of blights and it won‚Äôt damage you.
---
Game is a bit slow right now for doing activities like that. Your best option is the /r/ destiny the game discord server.
---
How?
---
Thanks fella. I just like to collect everything lol
---
People still say git gud?
---
The roll you get isn't the best. 
---
When you get High Caliber rounds and a good barrel with range, its absolutely amazing. Once you proc Desperado and there are ads everywhere it's amazing.
---
Baraka on the field! Bring arm blades!
---
This is the best description of this event possible
---
5 hours is really impressive. Have you got to Fabled in previous seasons?
---
If breakneck is not an option, Bray Tech Winter Wolf is the way to go. Halfan D is not a bad option either. 
---
That winter wolf was the only weapon I used for a couple of seasons.
---
Ohhh ok. I totally agree about enhancement cores. They at least need to be slightly easier to earn I feel. But that may be just because I'm not the best at the game lmao. But that's why I have my clan to help grind out stuff.
---
I think that response is fair. Although as someone who has always asked that PvE and PvP be buffed separately (because I hate PvE weapons and abilities getting nerfs because of PvP), I'm also kinda of the mind to say "how does it feel now?" in regards to PvP getting screwed.
---
I like their mindset for Revelry, and I hope they try again. But I'd also like them to adjust things separately, because that would fix a LOT of these issues.
---
Damn that's smart. Going to solo Lake for more Miltia's.
---
I turn hate mail into memes üòÇ
---
It gets really boring. 
---
Day one 2x aTitans and a Warlock w Chaos Reach, we got to 101 and stopped there. It was hilarious with the melee buff, synthoceps, and Last Man Standing with One-Two Punch. One punch to big yellow bars.
---
Lmao what do SJW‚Äôs have to do with this?
---
I'd say above average at best. I can just about land a shot on a moving target. Quick-scoping; no way in hell currently. Reaction time is a bit slow with snipers, so I definitely need to work on that if I intend on using a sniper.
---
I have TLW and it's pretty incredible. But Ace is probably the most well-rounded HC in the game currently: Incredible range, decent rate of fire, great accuracy, and has decent bullet magnetism.
---
I'll try TLW/sniper combo. I've heard it's been legendary since D1, but I don't think I've ever actually tried it.
---
I find ADSing with TLW feels better and is easier to land crits. Is hip-firing better? ADSing only adds about 2 meters to range, so it's not a loss if you don't.
---
2 meters is 2.19 yards
---
Yeah you just go into nightfall, use the revelry grenade buff then add the nightfall grenade modifier. That's how I got the grenade triumph. Got it extremely fast.
---
I used that scout all the time until Forsaken launched, fond memories of killing cabal on Mars :)
---
What was that one scout which was very nasty in PVP that everyone was complaining about.   I think its the only other exotic scout rifle, with kills that drop void bombs.  man that thing use to be all over pvp lol
---
Them dang sjw's and their anti-crucible antics
---
Bungie did everything possible to make the game T for Teen so they could sell micro transactions to kids. Thank them, and quit complaining, there‚Äôs way better games to play. If you‚Äôre ranked gold or higher in rainbow it‚Äôs usually just strategy and teaming up after a great match. I even had people showing me the ropes without me asking in my earlier days with the game. Not to mention the guy sounds like a sarcastic troll, maybe don‚Äôt be such a snowflake?
---
If you have access to Breakneck, I don't think there's a reason to use any other legendary auto rifle.
---
Should‚Äôve known you were a PVE scrub lol
---
My message said 'i cant tell if youre kidding or if youre just that dumb' i deleted it so i could get all of his messages in one picture
---
This ‚ÄúPvE scrub‚Äù thinks you‚Äôre a ‚ÄúPvP scrub‚Äù but we can come together to agree that invading is lit
---
This is like those clickbait YouTube thumbnails.
---
Would sound like the titan's shield almost lol
---
Exactly what I was thinking.
---
Ah so we‚Äôre gatekeeping ornaments now?
---
Do you really not understand that is still grinding?
---
A bit. But I'd like 3-4 shot. Left mouse button for single target and right mouse button for chain.
---
It might not be great, but I'd be fun.
---
Indeed but fun is forbidden in the crucible...
---
Prolly cant but im still super far away but im coming up on fabled fast and its starting to get harder landing these kills as i get closer to where i should be. REally wanted the quest steps done before reaching fabeled.
---
What
---
Oh yeah, I somehow forgot about that...
---
Yeah i dont think you can anymore either but i still want one lol. Dont care where i get it!
---
Pop goes the cabal!
---
Are you high? It‚Äôs because I declined that misfit was good.
---
Oof. Maybe ill just have to commission a full size replica instead like Ace.
---
But with my sword I can block bullets without losing ammo, move faster and, If I do it fast enough I get my health regenerate? Hows that the ‚Äòworst‚Äô exotic?
---
That decision caused me to quit D2 until a few weeks before Black Armory came out.  
---
I caught up on Forsaken for a couple of weeks and then just gave up.   I still love the Destiny universe and follow the game closely, but my desire to play has been destroyed due to Bungie‚Äôs decisions like this one.
---
It blows my mind that the Blizz launcher tells me 92gb... 3 mb/s. oof.
---
I can't be the only one who is genuinely glad he is dead? He was not funny at all.
---
You still take damage by blocking. In order to get the heal effect, you have to block bullets immediately after blocking. You move slower than you would normally run. The speed increase is almost exactly the same as when blocking without the exotic. 
---
It is the worst in the game. So many more exotics can be utilized for better gameplay than this one. All of the people downvoting have never used it. 
---
Plus, you get seven sword charges in crucible with heavy ammo. Nothing you're doing with that that'll make any difference.
---
If it's the only exotic you're missing on your Titan just buy the legacy engram and the OEM is yours.
---
No transgender bullshit
---
Ive got a few essence saved up but thats because im grinding out that 40 strikes for service revolver atm. But that sounds pretty insane. Good thing i wasnt totally interested in them.
---
I see. I notice Invaders tend to run machine guns so it makes sense then. Thank you.
---
What hunter nade n super should i use now? Still top?
---
Post this on r/fireteams, you‚Äôll find more people.
---
Legendaries too.  It took me 8 engrams to get an actual legendary...which ended up being a class item, and so didn't do anything anyway.  It took a total of 32 or so to get one that wasn't a class item and that was something that I could actually use on the class I was playing as.
---
All-ice, all-ice, all-ice. Let's see what we got. Scorpion, from the shadows! Bring a hammer.
---
Damn!  My secret is out.  I've been using Coldheart since Prime came out with good results.  I guess others took notice.
---
Is that a gril? Omg a gril gamer!
---
I feel like Nova Warp passed on its powers to spectral blades before it got butchered
---
They were also like 75%+ duplicates somehow.  I got like 8 Wardcliff Coils in a row.
---
I see literally no reason why they wouldn't. I'm pretty certain that's just a reason they put out just so they didn't say "Cuz we don't want you on them."
---
In regards to the grinding one of the vendors gives you "welfare" gear that takes you to 640 light. And with Xur now selling forsaken exotics it's pretty easy to catch up
---
Thanks! Kinda what I figured and the fact that they don‚Äôt look that good explains why I don‚Äôt see them everywhere.

Holy cow so I'm not the only one who's thought about this! I can understand why there aren't any as it's hard to make a cloak, mark, or bond "important" and effective enough to warrant the exotic slot, but on the other hand, I could see the value in exotic class items that buff regen rates and mobility/resilience/recovery etc and would love an exotic that works across all subclasses rather than just one.

For your edit 2 I can give a few times.  D1 thorn, d1 autos, nova warp nerfed, one eyed mask, telestos  explosive range and damage, shotgun range, shards of galanor, up soon is spectral blades, proximity grenades, d1 throwing knives, pulse grenades, sword ammo on pick up, and invis not breaking tracking are the first things popping into my head
