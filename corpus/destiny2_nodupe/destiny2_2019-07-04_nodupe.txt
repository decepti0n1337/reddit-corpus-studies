That was all your fuck up, you should have kept going around the tree.

---
Dude I have 2 stacks of these freaking things.
---
Or make them drop more in excess.
---
I mean you're a Titan. Just gonna punch everything anyways lol.
---
How you gonna kill him in two seconds
---
Bang
---
Another Halo fan? :) Mithrax could be Destiny’s Arbiter, which would be amazing! He could be a vendor in the tower which sells Fallen weapons to Guardians.
---

---
Also if things are too complicated with making Fallen fit the classes, maybe the Fallen could be their own class, It could have Fallen themed supers.
---
Being allied with The Spider and fighting alongside his associates and helping out his syndicate in Forsaken was amazing enough, so imagined how good it would be to have the House of Light integrated into The City and have them as an ally.
---
I have a 1.4kda and grinded it out in 6hrs?
---
Dope! Looks like shipping is a flat rate!
---
It's https://www.light.gg/db/items/4222882592/g-335-anseris-overdrive/ with midnight Smith shader
---
She doesn’t deserve you anyways, king.
---
Put them in your vault..  lol.  I have like 6-7 stacks of 999 in mine.
---
X
---
I have 2 please give me some
---
I was going to switch extinguish for heavy weight
---
I can relate to this so much.
---
The craziest this got was when I was doing the special Savathun's Song strike for Thorn. I called my grandma but she didn't answer her phone. 
---
So I started the strike and 5 minutes in I see a call from my grandma. I just ignored it. 
---
Some time later another call. Again, ignored it.
---
Some time later I see a call from my mum. Again, ignored it.
---
Some time later I see a call from my other grandma. Again, ignored it.
---
Some time later another call from my mum this time on WhatsApp... Ignored it.
---
By the time I was done with the strike (25-30 mins) I had 5 missed calls from 3 different people. I had to call every one of them to confirm that I was still alive... It took me just as long as the strike... LOL
---
That was the last time I made a call before sitting down to play D2...
---
Um but its shite in pve, it's a pvp quest for a pvp gun...
---
But he gave us an offer we couldn't refuse!
---
That’s what I found as well.  The idea of waiting time for something to be created and being able to speed it up reminds me of clash of clans.  Paying in games should be only cosmetic.  There is a great example in Destiny and even better in Path or Exile.  P2W is the biggest scam in the gaming industry, and there’s no way to stop it.  Free to play games don’t care about their free players, only their paying winners who don’t care about the money.
---
... The last wish raid?
---
Collections tab.
---
is not showing what exotic i miss only what i own
---
See , you can say all that. How would I report you ? Why would I ? The original guy was just saying Warlock race, and all that. All i said was....   " I THINK your wrong. In my opinion. 
---
     Why do you get to tell me to fuck off, and I cant even you youre wrong ? 
---
   For the record , you r mean. And defiantly not why I play. But still, I don't mind having an inyeractiin with you and surely don't wanna offend. 
---
    I wonder if you get mad at all rants , cause ive seen some dozzies. It would take a lot of your time. And honestly. I just wish I knew what happened. I think it was his reaction back that maybe prompted it. 
---
    Sorry youre so mad at someone wanting equality. 
---
    Yes im kinda new, but you can see how long ive been on here. Sooo
---
I'm 25 and also love pushing buttons.

This! I could just not pick them up but that's not gonna happen.

I got my curse breaker today after doing the ascendant challenge every week sence launch of forsaken and just now getting the shell
---
D1 strikes were better
---
I got carried \_T-T_/
---
A “real fan”?
---
It’s a video game. Did you not read the post? I quit playing a few months after launch and am playing because I’ve heard it’s a lot better now so.. I guess no, I’m not a real fan.
---
Dudes not even trolling he's just legitimately this wacky
---
I hate you and your entire family.
---
I think just the EP shotgun was a big priority, I can’t say anything good about the armor.
---
Or they are Just better
---
It’s literally a vanguard box but ok
---
They were worthwhile
---
Opposite for me. 🤷‍♀️ Single girl, and idk where all these people are meeting their spouses that like gaming.
---
I never understood why it wasn't used a material for infusing DC armor.
---
Stolen Meme. Seen this month's ago
---
Huh?  If you do the clan weekly (for Hawthorne) and your clan is at rank 4, you get 7 enhancement/masterwork cores plus the powerful gear.  Doesn’t have anything specifically to do with a raid.  Same cores you could get from Spider or by dismantling gear.
---
I achieved 750 in week one of this season...
---
Destiny is my life
---
Thank you
---
That just means that other guardians are gonna dunk on him
---
r/whoosh
---
More than welcome!
---
Woah epic find dude! Have you tried opening the chest!? Did it give you anything :O!
---
You need the weapons and armor for certain seals
---
I would’ve jumped into it and fired myself across the cosmos.
---
it gave me a quest called isnt it iron pick
---
Fighting Lion catalyst is too. I grabbed it and Sunshots in the same day somehow.
---
People don’t use the recluse because it’s an SMG, they use it for the perk.
---
Hmm, well, I consider myself a good player, even my clan accepts I am, the second best in the pvp area, and I understand meta, but the classic super sonic movement hunter gets me, and my sensitivity is on 7 d2, and I have tried the 10, fast moving, but impossible to aim
---
There are, but it’s against Bungie ToS, or it used to be.
---
https://media.giphy.com/media/yJFeycRK2DB4c/giphy.gif
---
Xim Apex. Its slower than pc movements but still an adapter for mouse and keyboard on console. But it's not very popular so the chances you are coming across it are fairly slim. Try setting your sensitivity to max and see how fast you actually turn.
---
Subbed to both r/destiny2 and r/WoW, couldn’t figure out which sub this was from at first
---
No
---
Well, thanks for the advice, but that’s the point, I tried it and it’s fast, but impossible to move or run right, I have tried it on private, and I feel like I am lagging to misadventure death
---
But what about all the other armor sets that are exactly the same? Such nice designs, but nothing useful about it compared to regular purples that drop all the time. It seems like a waste of artistic talent to exclude such excellent styles because what you've got on is functional. So we see a bunch of people running around looking exactly the same because it's the most effective. I mean, why put other sets in the game if there's no performance incentive to wear it? Doesn't make any sense to me.
---
Ugh.... I do this all the time. Get trigger happy and blow it
---
THATS SO CUTE
---
Worth it
---
Hence why xim apex using a mouse and keyboard adapter is often used for better precision
---
Mountain Top, Outbreak, Breakneck, Blast Furnace, Recluse, Mini Tool, Sturm/Drang, Grenade Launchers, Shotguns with Trench Barrel, Riskrunner, Machine Guns.
---
But wouldn't it be more varied and unique for people to put on what they like because it looks good? Right now there's a ton of players running around with scatterhorn or tangled because of the perks. What fun is it to look like everyone else because you need to be effective in combat? Bungie will give us a million shaders but absolutely no good reason to use a different armor set.
---
Thanks for the nice simple answer
---
Minor/major/recoil
---
Outbreak has high single target dmg. Then a high rpm smg. For power i run grenade launcher theyre meta right now. For supers depends on activity. Most pve content isn’t too challenging so day break, nightstalker, and hammers. I myself run well of radiance with Luna boots just to melt bosses. But mainly use what you have fun with. Just about any gun will get you through most content.
---
Because Shaxx likes to watch me suffer
---
Boom count me in
---
EP armor tool the best players 5 weeks to get and everyone else about double or more and then, Year 2 Happened and the Armor became obsolete. Hopefully, it is reprised soon.
---
too busy snorting it and getting high
---
start chugging those bottles of tinctures!
---
I thought it was gonna be a screenshot with an even worse number tbh
---
Using your brain in a video game to not take damage.
---
Make sure you have a handcannon as an equiped weapon
---
cant you just chug the shit out of tinctures though? or can you not drink when you've already had one?
---
use Destiny Inventory Manager to move it to vault without going back n forth to the tower
---
You spelled Titan wrong.
---
So I take it you say titan I should main
---
I take it you're asking for the best choice?
---
Do you have a source for that?
---
depends on what you play, pvp only then play hunter lmao if you main pve then warlock is the way to go.
---
But is titan good in both?
---
so close. it's just 'die' not 'you die'
---
Best choice for pve and pvp I’ve maimed hunter since day one and have been playing a bit of warlock lately but I care a lot about the way my character looks and warlock doesn’t have many cool looking armour sets and what not I just want something that’s fun and good in both pve pvp and can look really cool
---
when forsaken launched it was the new thing so everyone spent a lot of time there
---
-titans after the millionth time they say they need a buff in pve
---
I care a lot about character fashion with female warlock I have noticed a lot of clipping with things and it bothers me I know it’s dumb
---
**you've developed an addiction to tincture of queensfoil**
---
They're all good in both
---
But fashion wise aswell what’s best
---
Flip a coin, or make one of each.
---
Except the sound in that scene was a blend of the sound vestian dynasty makes and the one Ace of Spades makes.
---
They're on PC or if on console, at Max sensitivity, high mobility, lightweight frames and/or custom mapped deadzone paddles.
---
Thank you sm, I appreciate it greatly.
---
me titan
---
me punch
---
The Pro Gamers who have performed the coveted Pro-Gamer Move
---
im not talking abouut the stat with mobility im talkng about the actual concept of mobility
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAA ok so a wallhack that lets you see every enemy is not strong imagine this comp match starts two possible points you use itand you know where the enemy is going
---
skullfort ah yes becase that5s so usefull shoulder charge gets easily cancelled regular melee is a regular melee 
---
greaves is your own fault if you die to it just like with jottun (except for spectral and warp) you are in your super if you stay aware of where people are you can stop tem before they een get the chance
---
you did rea it right i said i wasnt going to put refill exotics in becasue being able to get a third of your super is pretty strong
---
As a Titan main btw I totally disagree with this statement it is actually, 
---
**IF PUNCH MAKE HURT NOT STOP, USE BRAIN AS PUNCH**
---
Melting point? More like shattering strike
---
[Everyone disliked that]
---
If you had a lumina, or a friend?
---
He was killed, that was confirmed. Then later in one of the full curse cutscenes there was a scene where a ghost revived him and he became a guardian .
---
Yes sir, superb weapon
---
Where is that?
---
Never saw that scene. Just read about it though from when it leaked.
---
last word thorn then whatever the new guns called
---
What is this thing you call, a girlfriend?
---
Damn I need to learn this move for me to be able to secure a girlfriend
---
He really can be Calus about his soldiers sometimes.
---
Learn so that you may teach others, Titan
---
What is that
---
Oh I see
---
I invaded 3 times yesterday during a game and just greeted the enemy team, letting them get the kill/quest step. Do you think they returned the favor? Nope.
---
Full disclosure: was playing with friends, 2 of us still got the quest step done with Truth and we still won.
---
Yeah, it's all kind of shady when you consider that the Royal bathers were literally just born when you kill them
---
1 almost infinite range
---
2 fastest trigger pull in the game
---
3 one shot
---
4 easy to use
---
5if you get sniped or shotgunned it is your fault just because it doesnt have super defense doesnt mean its bad
---
Ouchie, my big W I D E shoulders sag in defeat
---
Ayyy. Rise up!
---
Ever seen 6 Thundercrashes hit a bosss at the same time? Me neither.
---
Yeah, with the hunter they have to proc certain requirements to build damage. Peregrine is just run jump and punch with a huge amount of damage.
---
Seriously tho what do u guys think is the best set I was thinking sentry or reaper
---
Yeah but manufacture and shipping takes a while, I think they’re pretty well made so I can understand the wait
---
Yeah throw melting point and one two punch shotgun if you really wanna stack more damage.  Read somewhere that the damage it puts out is equivalent to 15 uncharged melees
---
Thats what you get for using a fusion
---
Just looks smaller.
---
Reporting fellow hunter main
---
OR get truth. Done.
---
Can’t get a gf because I can’t put loyalty III on a hoe
---
Part of the lumina quest
---
After I just grinded for about 3 hours to get the hand cannon kills 3.3 hours is a nightmare.
---
Not really because it only works with shoulder charge and has to be mid air liars works with arc strider and on any melee you dont need your melee ability active to use it pair that with almost 600%melee damage u can output more dps with liars handshake than perigrine
---
*One Eyed Mask+Lord of Wolves*
---
Yep. That’s about right.
---
Yeah, true. But who else is going to it it when Warlocks are running Well and Hunters Teather
---
OUR BLOOD????!!! MEIN BLOOD!!!!!????
---
Tether is ad clear
---
PUNCH SOLVES ALL PROBLEMS
---
Yeah, i usually just show them this post and i become the life of the party
---
&gt;Hunters
---
well what bout tether? :(
---
This is horrible but I like this community so, take my upvote
---
moon's good at leaving people breathless
---
i don't understand what you did that others haven't?
---
to be fair, it's not like this wasn't a conspiracy before destiny came around
---
I'm not too good for them. I just don't rely on them.
---
There is also the Kell’s Scourge syndicate who we fight in a handful of Gofannon Forge quest step missions, as well as during the Gofannon and Bergusia Forge ignitions and during the Scourge of the Past raid, although they aren’t an official House, they are a crime syndicate similar to The Spider’s syndicate. The Spider’s Brother, Siviks, happens to be the leader of the Kell’s Scourge.
---
They wear House of Dusk colours, which I personally don’t like but I suppose they can sort of justify it due to them being a very new faction who only recently splintered off from the House of Dusk.
---
Also during the quest Zero Hour you fight against Eramis’s House of Devils. Eramis is a House of Devils baroness who is trying to get her House to rise back to the power it was at pre-Red War.
---
And of course there are two ally Fallen factions, The Spider’s Syndicate and the House of Light. The former being our main ally during the Forsaken campaign, and the latter appearing in the Zero Hour quest, where you help Mithrax fight the House of Devils at the Old Tower. Mithrax is the Kell of the House of Light.
---
Downvote......... You made my massive shoulderpads sad.
---
Drifter running commentary and Shaxx just spear tackles him &amp; screams in his face about how amazing it was
---
*Cries in Niflheim Frost*
---
i remember one day my dad &amp; I were playing Battlefield 2142 and half way through the game his mum calls and it drops our net. so he's trying to get that call to the point and done so we can get back to games.
---
there are girls inside the computer anyway
---
drop rate gets boosted a couple % if you play with a clanmate
---
I mean, you ain't wrong haha
---
Me titan. me strong! Titan strong vein arm. Do big punch!
---
Didn't know that.
---
Anyone have that feeling to reload his hc after he killed a player?
---
She is telling your her evil plan to destroy earth, while you are standing still forced to listen, Mr Bond.
---
I play too much siege, every bullet counts!
---
Yeah, I just read up on it after looking at the other comments. I had no idea this was actually a thing!
---
Dude got YEET'D
---
Im sorry buddy, next one for sure eh
---
I said this in another comment but primary/special/heavy bricks are a gameplay limitation and have no lore basis as far as I'm aware.
---
In theory we should be able to create anything with our glimmer, and ammo synths in D1 were a way of addressing that, but then we'd be able to make another rocket or MG mag or grenade drum every time we kill something but that would ruin the ammo economy that bungo oh so loves to keep pristine at the expense of fun.
---
Has to be a tier 2 or 3 to get weapon drops
---
I just bodyshotted  with my Izanagi Burden for extra style points
---
Yeah I should have edited it, the Xbox app now allows you to save to camera roll, so was just faffing about. Might have to make an edit at some point.
---
Guiding flame, the middle tree melee ability, empowers nearby allies. Ad that to empowering rift and the super itself (which has a virtually non-existant cooldown with phoenix protocol) and warlocks can apply/buff the damage of not just themselves, but a whole party, in more ways and more often than any top tree solar/middle tree void titan can. Even if hammer strike's 50% damage buff is greater than the rifts/melee of the warlock, it does not last nearly as much, and the warlock is capable of boosting the damage towards all enemys, not just whoever gets hit with hammer strike. On top of that, even in the most favorable situation, with impact mods and hallowfire heart boosting hammer strike's cooldown, it is still one ability. With the same impact mods and WoR+Phoenix protocol a warlock has similar cooldowns for three different ways of boosting damage over a longer period of time.
---
Legit, a great meme
---
Titan main for life here. I used to have 3 Titans in D1. I have a hunter alt, fuck Warlocks, they think they so smart with books, but I have yet to meet one that can outsmart hammer....
---
All without completely breaking them in the crucible too
---
Well... at least not making them any /more/ broken
---
No because Rose is just the basic hand cannon frame used to create Thorn and Lumina, meaning it has no intrinsic power or specialties. It’s just a regular hand cannon, whereas a cross between Lumina and Thorn would mean it probably has power from both the guns.
---
Yeah so death and life. For me that equals nothing since I think of -1 and +1
---
That’s why I’m saying strictly PvE
---
Deliberately dodging Lumina healing rounds so they keep trying to shoot at you and then get rekt themselves.
---
Spectral super is strong but its neutral game is pretty weak.
---
Or you just aren't good at playing titan.
---
Huh, I had no idea, thanks for that :D
---
Mobility also affects jump height and sprint speed too, sprint speed is not *that* noticeable, but between a 4 mobility and a 10 mobility it's pretty noticeable. The affected jump height from what I've seen so far is just the initial hop off the ground.
---
😊 ahh ur welcome
---
I thought you only needed the puzzle for the ship?
---
It impacts sprint speed, although, slightly per level, and also jump height
---
No problem fellow punch- I mean titan main
---
I remember when I mained Titan in Destiny 1 that all hunters looked to me like childrens. Childrens having problems to jump to the place with the hidden cookies.  Until they got these boots with triple-jump, I believe, then they where childrens triplejumping. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I still see hunters has small kids.  Hunterlings, I call them...(but in spanish, since I am spanish, so I call them "huntercillos"). 
---
As for warlocks, I use to do raids first in warlock,  for the self-rez clutch.  You learn how to play a warlock.  While playing a hunter seems to be a state of mind and something you are born into.
---
Psh, I’m not scared I’ll just ... hey where’s that crack between a bunch of stacked boxes for me to shoot him through!? This IS a nightmare!
---
Nice, looks much better than some of the tattoos I've seen on here that look like a tweaker did in their kitchen.
---
Nope I can't relate. Why? Cuz no shade but I go on 100.io, find group same time zone, you can even filter age groups, demographic type, PVP or PVE. I never met any of my clanmmates or other people in other groups. I'm in 3 groups. We drink, we raid, we strike, we talk shenanigan, we laugh, we help each other. Even when Im not playing with clanmmates, plenty people out there willing to talk to you. Just invite them to party chat, say hello, Lumina?  Yeah I got you.   Cheers.
---
I want the audio of this video.
---
It's already a subscription game. Want new content? Pay up bitch. Every year there's gonna be 40$ annual pass to milk kids and make them steal parents credit cards.
---
Was the full thirty seconds necessary?
---
Ain't that queens court? If yes that is uNknOwN sPacE
---
So sick
---
I’m jelly
---
I mean... You definitely shot her with guns...  But I guess?
---
Nah I made an error there. The Xbox app now allows you to save to camera roll, I was goofing about with it and didn't sort the clip properly. 
---
Know for next time!
---
What grenades are you using?
---
Maybe run along the top beams on the left or right?
---
If you have higher gear from another character on your hunter it's going to drop gear based on everything your character has. Also you only have one hunter right? Multiple characters of the same class will not drop multiple powerful gear rewards.
---
You think this is a gaaaame?
---
Where's the fun in that?
---
To be fair, One Two Handshake is extremely strong but requires a fairly lengthy and convoluted setup and you need at least 3 smaller enemies to start it or you can't do it in the first place. Titans now have Peregrine Greaves  which do absurd damage and take zero setting up.
---
[deleted]
---
Got it first or second try with goldy.
---
Valid point.
---
Despacito
---
Yeah, I used to main slova bomb, but have moved to well after nerf.
---
Not dying while running a strike? And not having to wait while someone doesn't revive you? And then having to make this post, or read my comments, or have this conversation while I defecate. 
---
Sounds pretty fun.
---
Wjy keep the shitty soldiers when you could just ask the guardians yoube been paying so lavishly to do the protecting?
---
Do ships and Sparrows count? No this is my second Hunter on my account and yes I already know a second character of the class doesn’t drop more powerful gear I just wanted to remake a hunter without loosing all progress with my old one.
---
After 6 hours, my hand decided to reject everything and we’ve decided to do brakes every 30 min, thats why :)
---
Oh super strange. I just started really getting into the game when forsaken dropped but wasnt sure exactly how the game worked. There's just so much to do in it and at times, totally overwhelming. I just hope I didn't miss out on this somehow, through a bug or something. I guess I could use one of my alts to get it but damn that would suck to not have it on my main.
---
And no worries!
---
9 hour session? Did you take a few breaks in during your tattoo or something?
---
Guardians are fearless
---
After 6 hours, every 30 min 5 min break due pain
---
Love it! The detail on the gun and decals is amazing!
---
We're not bringing religion into any D2 posts.
---
Now this is dedication
---
Simply loving this gun since release, especially in PVP
---
Rock spook
---
I like how the card lead up to the ace, that's really cool love it!!!
---
If you do not like Blast Furnace, give Bygones a go. 
---
Look for accurizes Rounds/Riccochet rounds/High Cal - Outlaw/Kill Clip/Rangefinder/what ever you like
---
Is that the inside of your forearm or your calf?

Uh... same thinking of how Shaxx's horn got broken off?

#Warlock for life!
---
No, but it’s good to have
---
I misspelled forsaken. Lol. Well, once you have that dlc, there should be a pursuit that shows up and it will tell you what to do.
---
They already said in the Jason schreier interview that they want at least PVE crossplay and that they're working on it for next year.
---
Can’t do nightfall solo. I’m bad
---
As a titan main I was only doing this for the puppies
---
Even better then my plan to use chaos reach😂😂😂
---
It's THE contingency plan. And plan A and plan B. If it didn't work, you clearly needed more.
---
i’ve ran a titan in comp and got the recluse in about 3 hours. Warlocks have the worst jump in the game. It’s slow and sluggish you can get shot down easily.
---
Does anybody have a picture of the tattoo?
---
I still have mine too! How about we pop em open and eat them for the launch of Shadowkeep!
---
Why is your closet empty?
---
Is the image deleted now? I wasn’t able to see it from that link.
---
This guy consults the archives
---
Sure is. Video ends where I pulled out my ghost to check it counted.
---
Sorry no pic, but now I feel like a jerk. It was just the hunter symbol with uneven lines.
---
I hope he is able to get it fixed. It could be great if the lines got straightened up.
---
Year 1 of destiny 2 feels like a bad dream. So glad this game has taken a different approach
---
I was originally thinking Truth but too slow and blade barrage a bit fickle but yours is effective and hilarious, respect 😂
---
Oh, so like the Whisper chests? I remember having to do one full chest run and then the other two weeks just regular to finish it in 3 weeks. Is it the same here?
---
Oh man... wait for that nerf. That'll be one expensive removal lol
---
I am as well, but at the same time am not. I feel like the shotguns, snipers, etc. Should have stayed heavy, for crucible.
---
Fucking grass watching committee
---
Cue the "This is amazing!" Sound bites...
---
did you complete the collections badge for gambit?
---
On scourge of the past?
---
Sorry for my bad editing skills
---
Oh wow, I didn't know there were mercenary guilds that operated that way haha.  
---
&gt;how brutally real world that game was. 
---
An interesting and accurate way to phrase it.  I suppose that's at the core of my opinion, I feel like videogames are a semi-healthy escape from the BS and unfairness of real life.  When those issues start to creep into the game, it's like you can't escape it anywhere.  At the same time, I can also imagine how a 100+ run drop would feel like getting a huge surprise bonus after years of working a dead end job.  
---
I'm glad we were able to mutually agree to disagree, respect brother
---
Borderlands is a great looter shooter, its incredibly silly which makes it a good time. Monster hunter is a game that never ends and its just killing monsters to create armor and guns which can be a tedious grind which is all I remember of it
---
Borderlands is good :)
---
It's deleted now and I am sad
---
That's really awesome! The cards work with the theme :)
---
DIG IT
---
I had to force myself to stop using Karnsteins because I found myself panic punching at inopportune times. Still very tempting to use them though. You can face tank exploding screebs with it
---
Is he wearing that one set of Titan Armor that you get from the Rise of Iron Triumph book?
---
It wouldn't be as big an issue if it was self contained and I could just avoid it, but there are quite a few exotics I want that have quests related to crucible, so I'm stuck slogging through it. It's just painful really
---
I have been running triple grenade launchers and surprisingly i did not too bad, but you are less useful than weapon telemetries up close.
---
Even in comp i ran triple grenade launchers for a while....and even managed some triple kills (which don't give you extra points). Grenade launchers are super useful when you have a mate by your side, but hey, you need good team mates first lol.
---
This quest made me ignore cap points and camp on heavy ammo. It's just bad design. They should have made you do more regular kills and less double kills
---
Until a few weeks ago, I never touched comp. Been playing since day 1. I'm pretty good in standard PvP; average, I'd say.
---
I've never been more frustrated in all my life. Of course, I don't have any of the pinnacle weapons yet, so I'm constantly at a firepower disadvantage. Then there's the "oh, we had a teammate die in the first minute of the match. I guess it's time to quit", leaving me in a team of 2-3 against a 4 stack.
---
I'm not saying I don't need to "git gud", but I play about as carefully as I can. And then there are the 'nade launchers.
---
God, the 'nades.

It's a good think I have a ghost because I'm dying right now.

Doesn't include the tree in the corrupted strike. 2/10.

Rudolph the ned rose porkdeer.

God dammit garry not again
---
Yes. I am aware.  It was a smartass comment to the "solo punching". Thank you.
---
Damn straight. It was one of the only reasons that made playing D1 during spring and summer of year 2 and winter and spring of year 3 even enjoyable. D2 was no exception, especially during season 3. That's why these changes that Bungie has teased for Shadowkeep's Crucible sandbox are going to be the most significant in terms of keeping player counts high between content drops. Hopefully they captalize on this opportunity and then keep the train rolling from there.

They will do one of two things.

Had a very porky rose

??? That sentence makes no sences
---
Sorry i should have clarified, you’re entirely right, im just waiting for people to downvote it and say “gIt GuD”
---
He deleted it lol
---
Thanks, this helps! I have played plenty of qp amd comp crucible but I have yet to reset my valor rank. I have also completed forsaken a long time ago so im gonna assume its ressting the rank. Ty!

Can you teach me how to do a 180 shoulder charge kill because as far as I know I have never even come close to that. Also suppressor grenades are hard to hit imo. You’ve got a point with One Eyed Mask and I must just be awful with hammers if their blast radius is that big. Also I’m not exactly sure what you are on if you think burning maul is some god tier super and Sentinel shield is... inconsistent.
---
How many times were you one shot killed at that range and further by a sniper? I don't see why people are so butthurt about fusion rifles when sniping is rampant. And don't tell me about some imaginary skill gap when half the enemy team is camped up hard scoping from the back of the map.
---
The real question is why are you holding that fucking thing
---
Ahaha the argument to end all arguments. LoW
---
Never would’ve guessed
---
Maybe you should have listened to those doubts more closely......

You...you're one of the good ones, Guardian.
---
I actually stood at one spawn point and waited until someone invaded there. Blade Barrage took care of the rest. 😎
---
The waking vigil is great
---
Finger guns period
---
I had that too did you have another equipped exotic weapon?
---
Getting lumina got rid of my primary... So that's nice

I think you would fit right in!
---
Picking up a remnant adds four rounds to your mag.
---
Ha yeah iknow
---
Both people using fusions, guy shoots from beyond the grave, the shot passes right past you yet curves and still kills you. This truly is the comp experience!
---
Yeah, but we aren't buffed in damage until we use the Noble rounds.

About 1000 kills and ~100 bounties
---
Maybe you encountered a titan with the one eyed mask?
---
Yupp I used Izanagi finally and got it.
---
Si, Si.
---
I mean if you say one eyed mask and 1 hit SB isn’t dumb then hey be my guest
---
Omg! I did this happened to me to, I needed 19 points! To finish my revoker. I got control 4 matches in a row, while matching with the same 3 man. None of them capturing zones, all just pushing thei opposition spawn with tripple grenade launchers getting slaughtered 
---
. On the 4th time matching with them I backed out early to search for another game while there were still playing. Got survival and the W!
---
Huh. Idk about crucible, and I don’t know what happened there, but in PvE it happens when you go in a new area.
---
nope but if the enemy kills adds and they dont get to pick up the motes, you can take them.
---
wow ya sure got him
---
🔥👌🔥
---
Was that a first attempt? Either way, that was sick .

We killed the boss and he respawned with full hp if you look at the hp bar
---
I’m partial to more destiny maps than D2
---
I like you. Buffing my Titan would be very nice.
---
9 hours for that?? Bloody hell.
---
Thanks man 👍

Congrats!
