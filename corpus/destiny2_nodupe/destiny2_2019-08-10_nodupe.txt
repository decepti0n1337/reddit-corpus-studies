The Golden Age begins! Now who's going to die and get chosen by the Traveler?

---
I'd think that's better than them hurting others. Putting to rest then?
---
Anyone remembering this happening to Mr fruit
---
Oof. Bungo‚Äôs matchmaking is bad. Nice name btw. Flavortown
---
I actually like regular more. It may be slower, but a lot of Prime matches turn into steamrolls. If you have a bad start there‚Äôs little to no chance of recovery because the snowballing is so bad.
---
Which seal should I go for after dredge and reckoner

I don't get it.

Genichiro from Sekiro in a nutshell

And the next game i got connection issues which for some fuck knows reasons counted as quitted game  and lost more points......  
---
Man im loving comp in this game
---
As a player who dislikes crucible, 200 arc super kills is my least favorite part. (Warlock)
---
Yes
---
It‚Äôs 200 arc super kills anywhere
---
They can't insult hunters, we're too perfect
---
Get on it :) one of the more fun raids imo
---
&gt;!Pulled Pork is why.  One of the offering to the oracles gave an explanatory video, but only during one week - it is not available to see any more.  You have to YouTube it.!&lt;
---
Vestian Dynasty does not make the sound that came from that gunshot.... we pulled the trigger
---
Soooo let me get this straight.  You use an ethernet cable and have great wifi?!? Im confused. Ill say it again, im sure there is more to this story other than "my internet is fine and i can play all other games with no problems. But for some odd reason when i play destiny it goes to shit."
---
Don‚Äôt know about Crota but I‚Äôm ready to clap some atheon cheeks
---
People also ddos so there‚Äôs that
---
I've tried it before, I didn't really find it very fun
---
Yes.
---
10 gambit matches.
---
Better than I was a few weeks back when I was on Heroic 3 and got kicked to less than half of Heroic 2.
---
He's definitely an insecure toxic teen, just look at his comment history, it's a shame
---
... heading into a war with the cabal. Lol I love this game and community.
---
A warlock who defends us? A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one!
---
Do it as normal?
---
I usually don‚Äôt mind unbalanced games either, but when it‚Äôs to this extent it gets irritating. There was nothing I could have done to win that match.
---
Don't, it's pretty bad
---
Cheering on the guardian pushing their afk buddy off the tower.
---
Anyone unfortunate enough to play a crucible (or Gambit) match against someone running it,
---
Also known as a double down.
---
Combination is 3x
---
It depends. In general crucible, spectral is much better, but arcstrider is more niche, and makes for more hype moments.
---

---
For PvE, neither. Top or bottom is better for arcstrider, and Orpheus + tether is much better than spectral.
---
Please learn to spell I think I had a stroke
---
Holy shit I saw the carnage, he‚Äôs one that will never mature
---
For PvE Arc Strider with Radiant Flux or Liar‚Äôs handshake is a great load out.
---
Yep, that's basically what 50% of the posts on here are anymore, karma farms about OEM and Titan shotgunning apes.
---
Alright thanks
---
Yes, but liars handshake is best with top tree, not middle. That‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt bring it up.
---
Packages.
---
It‚Äôs not the first time people have been mean to titans since the start of destiny
---
F
---
she sold it at 2nd week of season of opulence for 2500 bright dust. first week was the ace‚Äôs ornament.
---
&gt; Like dude... the jump mechanic isn't fucking you on the Warlock. 
---
Yeah not anymore but is it too much to ask that every class gets the double jump for those who main Hunters and can't get used to the floaty jumps of the warlock and the hovering jumps of the Titan.
---
The sheer amount of downvotes he has is amazing. Definitely winning at reddit
---
As a man that plays his titan occasionally, he is a disservice to the Titan race and must be put to death for treason against the code of not punching the scorn.
---
I have never played destiny 1, but now that I hear about this I really want it
---
Aaahhh ok thought I was missing something. Thank you! üëçüèª
---
Every time.
---
Fuck that monkey, I had a harder time killing it than the final boss
---
Real vets get a tingle down their spine when they hear the word ‚ÄúGjallarhorn.‚Äù
---
That too
---
they only part that needs communication is who goes to which section of the map. after that encounters usually play out the same way every time. 1st encounter, switch after every 2 waves. switch again when the phase completes before the next set spawns. jumping puzzle is jumping puzzle. deception phase, just melt everything you see and show off your anarchy if you're designated shield breaker. boss phase, switch after ever 2 waves or 2 waves + crystal. pay attention to crystal spawns and do not break deception shield until crystal has been destroyed. rinse repeat until hand shooting. once hands are down, switch buffs, kill crystals and melt boss's face for the win. the only variation in the boss phase is some people prefer swapping after every crystal or going 3 wave then swap. either way, just pay attention to the guy with the buff, if he's moving to swap, just go swap. and that's how you beat crown without speaking at all
---
Why camp when you can rush with a shotgun or a shoulder charge.
---
All
---
Isn't one of the requisites for getting them is to get kills?
---
Which can be pretty damn rough when you're stuck trying to get kills especially if it's with a weapon you may be no good at.
---
You are 100% correct, but that‚Äôs still on the parents. They have to educated themselves on what their kids are watching and playing. The ESRB rating is there for a reason and the parents have to see that.
---
For bottom tree striker it‚Äôs that or armamentarium
---
I've played at least 80 gambit matches maybe more and I have never once gotten this dreaming city map.
---
That's from D1
---
"Gjallarhorn" ahh the good ol days.
---
Walter
---
It‚Äôs mostly because I was on ps3 and had no mic when I played vog, but I had one when I played King‚Äôs fall.

---
Why is Bungie in quotes?
---
Worm God
---
Yeah it is. I doubt they‚Äôre going to do anything to hunters and will change fist of havoc and hopefully dawnblade. I mean D2 is a PVE focused game and there‚Äôs broken shit. You just make claims on how good something could be and I‚Äôm telling you how other subclasses have good things as well. Game isn‚Äôt near the shape to be an actual competitive game if you want competitive play sweat lobbies where most of the shit is banned. 
---
Again agree to disagree

Here's a tip that made me not hate gambit and then eventually enjoy it--Just accept that invasions will happen and mentally prepare for it. Getting to the prime evil is about half of the match, then the invasions will start. When you get invaded, stop whatever you are doing *immediately* and find him. Keep heavy ammo to stop him, or maybe hang onto that super for a bit. If you have one, use malfeasance as it wrecks invaders quick. It makes it so much less frustrating if you are prepared, and it's so satisfying to kill an invader.
---
I prefer pulse grenades for arc. They're very effective, especially when thrown into a group of enemy guardians clumped together. Plus it has a wide range of damage, and can be difficult to avoid if thrown in small or narrow enclosures. 
---
And on the second one, I usually go with vortex grenades because they usually last longer and do a good amount of damage to enemy guardians close together, kinda like the pulse but not as effective, mainly because it's easier to avoid, unless you're cornered or get stuck on something. 
---
This is also my preferred PvE grenade preference for relatively the same reasons, but with npc rather than other players.
---
Maybe Origin or Horror Story would be my guess
---
I tap x when theres no respawn, then think "wait, shit"
---
Meh, some groups just dont want to waste time or have a higher chance to fail or take longer and so they optimize composition and loadouts. Nothing wrong with that, everyone has their own situation. If you don‚Äôt like it don‚Äôt join it, but don‚Äôt disrespect their rights. However I feel like Bungie needs to change things, specifically Well being overpowered and auto-reload, so that people can run whatever they want and not feel disadvantaged.
---
*cries in hunter dodge*
---
Because it's been a tradition since D1
---
I've got 2000 key fragments...grinding out more boxes is more compulsory for me now than beneficial...gotta use em somehow...and the shards are worth it at least.
---
It's almost always striker titans for me. Just died three times to one, then got killed by another one of the fuckers who'd just popped his. No time to react. Oof.
---
*looks at the moon* 
---
Or is it?
---
Get rekt
---
It's origin story. Unfortunately I have to get lucky and get it out of a engram from zavala
---
Umm supers?
---
I came here to see what people thought about the titan logo lol. The rest look fine though
---
I covered it

heh, nothin personal kid

No just been watch the Byf videos

happy cake day :)

Creeper
---
ohh boy, *grabs popcorn* this‚Äôll be good
---
I think the Drifter mentions ghorn in one of his lines.
---
I immediately thought, "Wait, WHAT?"
---
i always kill the first one since damage on the first is nothing
---
gang gang
---
Happened to me tonight as well, took 4 games to get that last win.
---
I'm just holding onto a smidge of hope that they can be new exotics. Honestly what do I lose if I get nothing? I figure its worth a shot. I'm a Synthoceps Titan and  Monte Carlo would be crazy to run alongside it so I'm taking this little gamble.
---
Ah. Glad I wasn't the only one that saw it
---
Pro tip: If you are on ps4 alternate circle and L3 instead of spamming circle :)
---
I mean thats hunter like my main. So we cool. I see you
---
I do this even tho I only played vanilla destiny 1 2 years late do I get partial vet status
---
I get it! Didnt use to like titans as much but with middle tree solar and the missile and middle tree arc is just cool! And since both are polarized topics i have to agree with it lol

You sir deserve more orange arrows.

I used to like gambit, then I went for dredgen and now I don't like it anymore. Go figure.
---
DFQ time... There is a run speed buff, makes white steaks as you run. It does not show as a buff in the character screen. What is it and how is it acquired ?? (I have googled myself to near coma trying to find this) TYVM for any and all help.
---
looks like a revision is needed
---
Don‚Äôt mind me sitting at table 8 since there is no last word
---
I said it looked decent, that‚Äôs a nice way of saying they tried. Never said it looked good.
---
ok ok ill delete this make a revision
---
The classic someone disappearing to go to the washroom; one of my friends upped that by going to the grocery store for 3 hours, he‚Äôs a special case in our raid sessions
---
I'd rather use the malfeasance for my exotic than truth when my tracking roar of the bear does just as well with near max blast radius for anti-invader rockets.
---
I completed this quest without even knowing I had it. Accepted the quest when I got the game at the start of the year and about a month ago got the sniper :/
---
The J and the G are swapped. It's supposed to be Gemini Jester
---
Untrue
---
Honestly, i solo'd an entire reset in gambit. Did just fine and enjoyed it. Solo players do have access to weapons that do just fine in gambit. Not every top tier weapon is a raid weapon.
---
Congrats, Your The Only One That Got It Right!
---
I'm calling it. Dawnblade is going to be the next hated super for everyone to bandwagon on after Juggernaut gets nerfed.
---
Honestly, my tracking roar of the bear does just as well for stopping invaders. Kinda makes me laugh how few people expect to be shot at by a tracking rocket not from a truth. Even funnier when a truth user is on the receiving end.
---
A lot of groups kill at 2x. If you're in a well and the boss is tractored, one person with anarchy and mountaintop can do 70% of the bosses health. 3 people with MT and one with anarchy in a well can kill in 13 seconds with no tractor. The difference between x2 and x3 is very minimal - I think it goes from 23x damage to 28x damage.
---
You‚Äôre right. Anybody that uses off Meta weapons must not know what they‚Äôre doing...
---
Oh well there ya go lol I didn't know
---
Emote on top of the rally flag at public events.
---
I enjoyed the elements that gave you a choice or do not restrict the activity you need to do. Not much fun to log on and do the same thing for hours. But I guess its designed for patient people who spread it over the month
---
Siiiiick gotta make a last word so you can dial wield

Do you get the same result?

Everything checks out.
---
I‚Äôm convinced people who put 420 or 69 in their gamer-tag or username are so starved for attention they get a rise out of wondering if people are just thinking about about them and the monstrosity they call themselves by. Is trolling a hate crime the next logical step after that doesn‚Äôt do it for them anymore?
---
Yeah for insulting or something
---
If the raid is similar in scale to Last Wish (which I‚Äôm expecting it will be) I wouldn‚Äôt even be surprised if it takes 12+ hours. I bet a lot of worlds first runners are gonna be prepared for it to take that long

Unbrokens use Strykers Sure Hand without Ammo in Comp

Oh so do I usually, it's what I play most in Destiny tbh haha it's just that I decided Gambit would be more efficient üòÇ
---
Been using crucible as more of a break from the Solstice stuff recently though haha
---
**bows frantically to OP**
---
Cancelling revives for fun (especially around 90 percent)
---
Have you ever used it in gambit?
---
Good times finding and dying the immortal knight in the tunnel at cosmodrone. The first of many experiences.
---
I agree with yo but in that case hunters Dodge should be a not more powerful.
---
Absolutely, strangely it's a great comp map. Almost like it was designed for 4v4
---
True vets remember the immortal knight in the cosmodrone beta.
---
Perfect answer, just what i was looking for! Thanks :&gt;
---
Literally yesterday, I was in quickplay and spawned in a long corridor (on that map on mercury, forget what its called), with an enemy like 5 meters away. We just slowly turned, stared at each-other for a few seconds, and walked in different directions. Truly, an epic gamer moment.
---
Unbalanced and annoying, Prime is better tho because it takes some of the bullshit out and it‚Äôs only one round
---
‚ÄúSo then I opened the crate... **needless to say, I sent the whole shipment back to Fenchurch‚Äù**
---
Nessus, on the Barn. I think it‚Äôs pinned on the subreddits main page as well though ;)
---
The Cabal Barge on Nessus
---
More like all roaming supers
---
Try playing rumble on dead cliffs
---
i am a warlock main and have only ever really played my lock. our jump sucks compared to the others imho but its manageable. as long as you dont miss because if you sink too low theres no getting back up and that is my only gripe. locks suck at going up
---
Seems like he favors Warlock
---
Walfas? in 2019? unheard of
---
When you load in? Ha! I start spamming before My ghost even finds me in the cosmodrome
---
"Ah! Shit! Here we go again"
---
A bunch of different loadouts tbh
---
Used Liars handshake, recluse, mountain top and anarchy for all the way up to the Shur Eido statue. Having the melee health regen for the ogre fight made it so much easier. I killed it in three phases, didn't bother trying to punch it to death cos I was just getting boss stomped all the time lol
---
Dul Incaru I switched to Riskrunner cos they shoot a lot of arc and it makes it easier to survive. Used golden gun with celestial for maximum damage on her also and finished her off with hammerhead
---
Stay determined, Guardian. It's worth it.
---
You do, on occasion have to pay for new content. This is by no means pay to win.
---
I think people were just joking in the earlier comments
---
Considering he only has 108 shards, I highly doubt he has every exotic. He likely just didn‚Äôt have colony and didn‚Äôt but it.
---
I know, I just said I didn‚Äôt have it that‚Äôs lol
---
You have no room to complain, at least shoot the enemy's while you wait.. or go grab the few motes needed to open the portal yourself.
---
For a moment i thought it was just the intro of forsaken where the screen is white then slide to blue. D1 still have the best music imo
---
1) play warlock or hunter
---
2) wnjoy
---
The game.
---
I mean what dlcs would I need the game is free
---
Yeah but whats the point, theres only a benefit to doing 100ks so you may as well just do them.
---
If they added better loot the higher the multiplier it would encourage people to set a higher one
---
Thanks for showing love bro, means a lot!  And yeah, I randomly joined a fireteam and we got it in one go.  Never went back to orbit once.
---
he‚Äôs only a pve player so he just knows melting point can be done by weapons and rally is useless if he has lunas pepehands
---
Issue with trees like that is it causes 2 problems for one reason.
---
You actually get *less choice* since people tend to find whatever the best perks are for any one thing it would make those the only viable perks.
---
An example would be solar titan. I could potentially take the solar throwing hammer, with sunspots, and a longer lasting super
---
While in PVE I could take sunspots with Burning Maul. Now suddenly my tornadoes of fire last *stupid long* 
---
With the way the system is **now** I choose between 
---
A) hammers that explode on contact and can make double kills but a shorter super 
---
B) A  super with longer duration and sunspots, but I have to be more accurate
---
 or 
---
C) A healing hammer with a potential to one shot, and a super that can counter other supers instantly, but is slow. 
---
A secondary is that it makes things *easier* to balance since skill choices are limited to one tree or the other.
---
Now there's situational choices, you wouldn't take shoulder charge if you can't hit the boss, and you wouldn't take sunspots to a boss that constantly moves.
---
- move the purple ball to where Saladin always is for iron banner 
---
(Green ball spawns)
---
- move the green ball to the stairs right behind eververse(the hidden ones kinda facing the walkway between zavala and shaxx)
---
(Black ball spawns)
---
- move the black ball to the level above where it spawns and all the way to the end of the right side
---
(Blue ball spawns)
---
- move the blue ball to the cutout in the aforementioned walkway between zavala and shaxx
---

Oh PvE, titans still are not that bad. My friend runs titan all the time and beats me out a lot mostly cause Im not that great though.
---
Curse of Osiris and Warmind are free. Forsaken and Annual Pass are the ones you have to buy.
---
Thank you kind stranger, amazing map!
---
im certain you‚Äôre a good player! titans aren‚Äôt bad in pve and are too strong in pvp, it‚Äôs an odd mix tbh. i can proudly say ive never used oem though
---
I love it when people are happy gl. (:
---
The bunny hopping is across every game. Watch a wow raid.
---
Hey do whats ya got to to win, I don't really judge loadouts anymore as I consider most imbalances in PvP to be the maps fault anyway as they're either to weirdly small or too weirdly open. There are few maps with an in between.
---
I love titans, but hunters are becoming my favorite class for PvP cause of GG, but Warlocks my go to PvE class.
---
Can you give me as many details as possible for Dul? Eg. Loadout, strategy.
---
Yeah but not before trying to salvage the game first
---
We've stepped into a war with the cabal.

Datto just wants Recluse and Mountaintop to be brought down a notch because they're by far the best PVE weapons in the game, but they're from pinnacle PVP quests. Recluse and Mountaintop are actively killing loadout diversity in PVE. DTG and YTers like Datto call for nerfs of stuff and usually state what fair nerfs are. It's the fault of the sandbox team whenever something is gutted, and even then they're not immune to human error they will make the wrong call sometimes.
---
Why is nerfing the aforementioned supers in crucible a bad thing? The current state of crucible is a mess because of them.
---
One time I landed and it was a 4v0 and we won instantly when touching down
---
Dont know if it's TRUE but I heard if you preorder shadow keep you get forsaken and annual pass so you'll have all the dlc
---
Ruined an attempt at solo, flawless shattered throne once for me 3/4 of the way through. Just went to bed after that.
---
Then I mean the game will be free in Oct 1 so
---
Ok so I ran bottom tree golden gun, celestial nighthawk. Mountaintop, Riskrunner, hammerhead. 
---
Armour had one minor resistance mod, one taken armourmants, and two transcendent blessings and a recovery mod. Submachine gun scavenger, grenade launcher loader and submachine gun targeting. 
---
Let the adds hit you with arc, shoot the shit out of them and make sure they're all dead. Lower the Knights health to one third. Destroy crystal, kills adds, finish off knights and then Holden fun Dul and finish her off with hammerhead :)
---
Me when I realize the 3rd armour has more objectives...
---
I think the d2 skill trees allow us to get cooler/more powerful abilities because they can be balanced around not having overpowered combos with the other abilities
---
Oops? Lol
---
Yea GG would be hard.  Hilarious that I guess CR is *technically* a roaming super haha
---
Finally they acknowledge it
---
Been playing on and off since Solstice came out.. almost finished with Green set.
---
The drop rate is minimal but keep in mind that now it is much easier to farm it. If u find 2 or 3 more guardians to help you, you will probably get it relatively quickly. For me it's the only reliable rapid fire-secondary shotgun for pve, wishbringer is ok and badlander is not bad but they are not that amazing in my opinion. Although, you can always use those 2 until you get the ikelos.
---
If you get caught off guard you can still die to it, but I agree that skillful players evade.
---
Shadow's Stried from Crown of Sorrow

WHO WON!?

https://youtu.be/1gqDOBWMzx8
---
Which weapon is that and how do you get it?
---
Criticism always appreciated friend :)
---
Nice
---
First part: callouts and ad clear 
---
Second: jump and shoot purple crystals
---
Third: have a tractor and spikennade launchers don‚Äôt die
---
Fourth: same as third except harder
---
Thx for the advise I sure will do that
---
Yes, finally! Another guardian who also likes stargate!
---
This picture has to be faked, because 
---
1: nothing can kill a sentinel when he has his shield
---
2: sentinel shields are constructs of light
---
Thank you.
---
For console users that have a 500gb system this is absolutely mental. For PC players too as Steam does the same thing of requiring double the space for installation so its a hassle all round
---
Ahh that makes sense.
---
steam does the same. A lot of people have 500gb SSD's so this is annoying for both platforms!
---
The true solstice sparrow is the micro mini
---
SSD or dont bother to be honest. HDD are old tech nowadays only really useful for backing up files like personal videos / photos etc. Not for running games on
---
With my hunter I use service revolver and wavesplitter. Then I use gemini or liars. Heavy is just whatever I feel like. I never get heavy ammo anyway
---
On my Titan I like sythosepts (sp?) With Cerberus and last man standing. Though lately I've been using stuff like bygones, gravaton, and outbreak for my stupid broadsword quest and OEM because what other general long range exotic armor is there? Pffff
---
Yeah it‚Äôs unfortunate that the micro has invisible barriers making it look small but handle like a regular size sparrow
---
Sounds like it works to well, and bungie is afraid of it.
---
but Cayde‚Äôs okay right? *right?*
---
*Tear goes down my cheek*
---
He sure is buddy, he sure is.
---
It‚Äôs a fake sentinel shield. You‚Äôre correct about the paracausality of the sentinel shield. It‚Äôs possible that replica sentinel shields exist in-universe, and the fallen took one because it looked cool. 
---
However, the picture itself is not fake and it‚Äôs in the loot room of The Empty Tank.
---
Duty Bound is an auto rifle that only drops from Savathun‚Äôs Song.
---
I remember reading the same but when I started really going for cursebreaker but I swear I read something a while back from bungie confirming that that was the only intended way for them to dropI don‚Äôt have source for that as it‚Äôs been a while best of luck in your hunt guardian
---
It lets bungie balance better and gives us more synergy/power. We currently have a lot of very powerful abilities that would not be possible with a D1 style skill system. As someone else said here if they changed the current system while staying with the current skills, you could for example have slowva with devour and handheld supernova or spectral blades with becoming invisible when using dodge. The current system lets bungie make more powerful skills at the cost of some customisation.

I died after the maze and put me back in it
---
What helmet though????
---
Hmm...
---
Well, I suppose there are worst ways to spend time in Destiny 2 than roaming the Dreaming City. 
---
As an aside, does Dreaming City Gear, such as weapons and such, drop from public events and resources chests?
---
Oh my glob thank you
---
You dress-wearing magicians and rollie pollies should can it
---
Houston we have lift off

The purple one.

Play spectral blades

I think it‚Äôs from year 1 when Cayde gave out treasure maps weekly? But honestly I don‚Äôt remember where I got it for sure. It‚Äôs under emblems &gt; open world. If you see it greyed out then it should still be obtainable in game.

Real vets found the Destiny teaser in ODST on their own

Life is haunted

Ofc you can just wear it, it's just much better at legendary state.
---
Sideways
---
That is not october 1st its patch 2.5.2.2 which is in September bud
---
Last perdition is an unlock? I never knew that. I am 0 iq.
---
There was also the fact that most of the people going for worlds first didn‚Äôt have good gear but now with all the gear we gained it will be easier then when last wish came out but still be hard

Um idk what the hell I watch but my soul is intrigued!!  Very Cool!!
---
Are you joking? I‚Äôm a Hunter, and the class ability sucks. It either recharges your grenade/melee, loads your weapon, or makes you invisible for a few seconds. The warlock and hunter abilities are much more useful, and they can help you solo or in a team.
---
Pretty sure its real, guardians have been known to use stuff like that to focus their light, like for hunter I‚Äôve seen a broken gun be used to create the golden gun.
---
Dm you
---
Welcome to the Tower.
---
Hmm, wonder if anyone has done this before... Not entirely sure but oh wait I am. This is the third repost in 3 hours I've seen on my home page, not even in this subreddit.
---
Because its not available in game.
---
In the video, he does the same thing over and over again, with no difference between them. It's clearly on a loop.
---
You go into the bus and go to the end of it even though it looks like it‚Äôs empty here is an entrance to the building at the end
---
I‚Äôm not, I‚Äôm willing to buy them the $40 expansion for exchange of a few hours of playing together to get the quest done
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox dm me if you‚Äôre also on Xbox
---
Your the real mvp you know that
---
Yea definitely not a medal, it was a neutral quote, we got super close to their score.

the helmet is a festival of the lost mask
---
This isn't superior. Its just full of non-options. You find the ideal skill set for your subclass and forget the tree exists.
---
Haha you're on ! See you around if you play on EU.
---
It just said it's gonna be the third week of solstice and asks if you've gotten your majestic set yet, plus that the EDZ will be the flashpoint.
---
Saint-14 helm
---
Also on the weekend so a ton more people will have the opportunity to run it for longer ,we may see a different world first team for once üòÇ
---
Cool cool, I've saved your post, looking forward to the vid. I like that you're chill about the guy reposting your efforts without credit, still worth calling those people out though.
---
When shadowkeep releases, will forsaken content be relevant?
---
Controller feels weird to me with the higher fov, I‚Äôm used to controller but keyboard is definetly better. Little to no recoil, more precise aiming, no need for traction boots, etc.
---
imagine getting downvoted because people dont have knowledge about the game lol. sorry man
---
Well to be fair, as far as I remember the ‚ÄúTOS violation‚Äù was something along the lines of launching a mission, getting to the first chest, looting it, backing out and doing it again.
---
Literally just grinding, they considered ‚Äúmanipulating RNG‚Äù or something. Like, okay, and? If the RNG and perks weren‚Äôt so shit in the first place players wouldn‚Äôt have to do it, and even if they do, who are you to say that‚Äôs wrong?
---
I'm chill with it. I told OP that others might not be so he might want to be careful in the future. I'll be doing a much nicer post here at the end of the day so keep an eye out for that if you're interested in some of the destiny merch
---
Crucible is why I stopped playing destiny. The balancing is terrible
---
I got my Revoker kills done in one day of IB, still haven‚Äôt got enough glory lol. Got to 2100 last week though, Mountaintop is my main concern more than Revoker tbh, still don‚Äôt have its kills and I‚Äôm not getting them in comp
---
This is a pointless post there‚Äôs drastic changes coming in shadowkeep
---
That's the green Hand in Hand. Hawthorne sells it frlm time to time, should be in collections
---
You actually okay against four stacks? I watch the the matchup to make sure it isn‚Äôt.
---
It probably isn‚Äôt but I just finished revoker, recluse and Lunas Howl so I‚Äôm pretty sick of comp now. Is it worth getting the kills in quick play even though u get slower progress ?
---
Oh ok I didn't know that about the swords. Does all it do is trap them or does it have any other effects?
---
not even the pre nerf deathsingers scream from kings fall was that loud. holy shet.
---
Nice and simple.
---
Sorry what
---
I'd rather them push back the launch date to make sure it isn't rushed.
---
Haha. Modified my words and corrected some bad English. Tired at work.
---
The arms are Doom fang pauldrons with the lordly homage ornament
---
I'm debating whether I should buy the Forsaken Complete Edition now or wait until the move to Steam. My finances are limited, so I want to get this content for the lowest price I can. Do any of you know if there's any rumours (or announcements) regarding a lower price after the move to Steam?
---
I know I don't have to buy Forsaken to play Shadowkeep, but I feel like I'd miss out on too much content if I don't pick it up.
---
Niiiicccceee
---
How bout the fact that the blowing a kiss emote wasnt just given, and you got it out of an engram for proof it wasnt the first time lol
---
I just came back not having played since launch and I like it honestly.
---
For casual players like me it definitely feels overwhelming but at the same time I love the massive amount of content. I'm not really in any rush for endgame so it's nice to have so much story, quest, etc stuff to do while also hopping into a gambit or crucible here and there.
---
It makes it really feel like you're getting value for money.
---
Hope you get some rest. And yeah I dont know why but I have a thing against quitting games no matter what I face. But I respect that too
---
Well...at least you were able to capture his THICCness
---
Go to the barge
---
I'm not tellijg you to switch. I'm making fun of people who complain about "pc being easier"

Rest in F‚Äôs in the chat
---
Are you asking can you expand your light level while only owning shadowkeep?
---
The most fun? Titan and max grenade Regen, Middle Tree Defender and Heart of Inmost. Everyone and everything is either dead or suppressed.....ALL THE TIME
---
Thanks, but one question; what does the thing in the bus give you?
---
It disappeared when I shot it with my smg
---
I‚Äôm a titan and refuse to run one eyed mask. I also won‚Äôt run jotunn in crucible anymore. I‚Äôve had too many deaths from that bullshit.
---
They can already 1 shot you with their shoulder, they dont need any other blunt force weapon

That has nothing to do with them, people are going to play (or not play) however they want, and unless these players are breaking Bungie‚Äôs terms of service, then they won‚Äôt do nor do they HAVE to do anything. You‚Äôre gonna end up in these scenarios and they‚Äôre going to suck, but that‚Äôs what happens with Online Games.

---
Also, you‚Äôre on the Winning team, what the Hell are you complaining about?
---
I‚Äôm right there with you. At least it‚Äôs a finite number of matches even if you lose every one (200). Play rumble. If you get 2nd place it counts as a win, if you get 3rd it doesn‚Äôt kill your streak.
---
I got it in 4 runs. I know that there are people still running it religiously for it, but the thrill of actually getting them to drop is way better than paying someone to do it for you.
---
Hunters are about utility and warlocks and titans are about damage, invisibility is OP, I know because I made a hunter build all around being invisible. Hunters have truesight, also op, they also get a melee tree (arc) that's actually better than a titan melee build. They get smoke bombs, the best vertical game play in the game with stompeez, I could go on
---
I said the opulent armor in my original comment
---
Wtf why does that look so good
---
It's not much but its honest work.
---
Forget it.....
---
This may be a stupid question but uh...
---
How is this Bungie's fault? At all?
---
I think they teabagging dead body of Anthem
---
Top 3 in Rumble counts as a win.
---
Is this a real....serious....question?
---
I cannot believe people are actually saying botting is fucking okay right now lmfao these morons are unbelievable
---
Yes it was. I never opened any more packages after getting the armor step done.
---
I cryyyyyy when Uldren deserves to diiiiiiiie.
---
It's an added effect
---
Honestly, no. I still get farmed by people running pinnacle weapons in rumble. I suck. I can barely get .5 efficiency when I play crucible, I should never be in a match with anyone that has ground Luna's or Not Forgotten.
---
I'm a simple person. This made me laugh. Thank you.
