Oof I was gonna volunteer to help you out but I'm on ps4.

---
---
and?
---
I‚Äôm using bad reputation and it‚Äôs been good. Just tap with it and keep practicing.  You‚Äôll get use to the recoil
---
Why do a public event in general? If you're gonna do it at all might as well go all the way.

How much glimmer is it?? Mine just says to pay him off and I'm at 50k right now

I was thinking the uncle that asks if you want to go smoke a joint before dinner

Dammit. Ok thank u!

It's simple math guardian.

I think all the d2 community agrees that after they leave their immune shit they always need to get punched/ stabbed or whatever the war locks do

Oh so I don‚Äôt need to equip anything in that slot? It s just like a perk?

HeRoIc Is rAnDoM

I play fairly regularly. Do most powerful drops every week and raid once a week. Im always almost out of shards and every time i think im catching up xur comes around again
---
You get radiance from the forges as random drops, take it to Ava and get the part to put in there
---
you forgot grandma Eva!
---
if you aim at their feet you might also get a headshot
---
Ahhh I see! Ok great thank u kindly
---
Nah she is your moms uncles grandpas sisters friend who tries to get you into a pyramid scheme
---
a female guardian?. good luck on your journey ahead, while my path was short may you go on and live it up and remember to do those bounties.
---
*GASP* how dare you say that about her! that tonic was actually real.
---
Freaking awesome

When they‚Äôd revive in D1 and you would kill them again

Seems very shellfish of him...

Seems you guys need to do more Raids. Every time you get a Master Worked Apex Predator from Last Wish it's actually 7 Enhancement cores in disguise.
---
what the people on the street thinks we do: slay monsters, killing gods, annihilating dragons 
---
what we actually do: grinding the same lost sector for 924 hours to get a shotty
---
It‚Äôs the only place where it can drop.
---
AEONS Got a huge buff. I wish this helm would get some rework because right now, it looks cool and that's about it. I love this helmet!
---
I did this step with Crimson in Rumble, and it only took me maybe 10 matches - which is relatively a lot for most players.
---
There should still be other players in the social spaces. If there aren't maybe check your time and date settings to ensure they are accurate.
---
Everybody gansta until we pull out the tether bow
---
Does it not count as being on the playlist?
---
Big Mcthankies from Mcspankies
---
Yeah, i kinda wish I could actually play rumble
---
You think the recoil on recluse is that bad? Damn lol yall really must not actually have used the weapon
---
I have it, it's ass at medium range.
---
Hunters dps only/occasional support with shattering strike. Titans are bad but have some fun gimmicks. Warlocks excellent at support ok at boss dps
---
Bungie just knows that people will try and cheese it through that and they wanted to prevent people being given the kills. I'm also awful at crucible, so I feel your pain. You'll get there eventually.
---
yes, who could forget the legends of these roaming marauding minstrels?
---
Me too.
---
... because its a close range gun
---
Aww that was my favourite exotic armour until Taken King came out and I got the sealed Ahamkara grips.
---
Congrats, Guardian!!
---
lightweight, i have 43
---
The drifter is like that uncle you never see but he gets you something cool every couple years so you remember him fondly but you don't actually know him
---
Swoletheon, Mind of Infinite Gains was clearly the first beta test of Dynamax. If only we knew...
---
Last Man Standing is pretty good.
---
You know how OP and easy quest would be in this game if you can have friends go into private matches and just do quests in 5 minutes
---
True
---
Feel your pain. I would get one headshot kill maybe once a day playing for maybe 4 hours a day twice a week. Took far far too long and now ace of spades just sits in my mail  üòÅ so I can't help but just stick at it. I got there eventually so you will too. Just try and stick to groups of people and ninja kills
---
Oh it actually does something? I thought it was just a slight glow to look nice.
---
And this is why you were the coolest graduate :)
---
Were the Forsaken supers tied to the campaign though?
---
I specifically remember the FAQ stating Forsaken's campaign won't be available unless you buy it.
---
It was great for taking out shanks when the outbreak perfected mission first came out
---
Where is the Korok?
---
I used it a lot before the fix, and it was still really good. You just had to learn to control the recoil like you would with TLW on console.
---
I've been playing comp to work on pinnacle weapon quests, still haven't run into it
---
Do they not do the boom?
---
Were you high when you wrote this too?
---
Do you need to have completed the Ratking quest line?  Got my outbreak last night and I have yet to do the Ratking quests.
---
Guys trying to be helpful and you‚Äôre just trying your hardest to be a dick.
---
comp is trash with LoW. only ‚Äúcounter‚Äù i‚Äôve found is a full fire team running Aeon exotic armor set. 2 warlocks 2 titans preferably. Warlocks use handheld supernova and titans use shoulder charge. those abilities will charge eachother so you get them quick. only downside is using Nova Warp since LoW can kill you before you even come into range of killing someone with Nova Warp.
---
:)
---
Thanks for the inspiration. Looking forward to doing that next May!
---
Thanks for the spelling corrections and your input

Cayde-7
---
What does the catalyst do? Improve it‚Äôs Cosmology perk or stats?
---
Yeah I‚Äôve never got a high medal on my warlock so I‚Äôm curious
---
ugh this game looks so much better on pc, I can't wait till I can cross save.
---
It's called brutal honesty and it saves people grinding for fucking awful weapons like Hush/Redrix

Drifter is the cool uncle you wanna be when you grow up but don‚Äôt realize he lives a miserable life

That's exactly how I felt last week after also jumping back in - just take it one thing at a time.

Melee skins could very well become a thing once they go f2p

They have a precision spot though don‚Äôt they?  Does it just not work?  It‚Äôs the shanks that always ticked me off because outlaw wouldn‚Äôt proc
---
Just wait for rose to come out on july 2nd an by then there might be a sale or wait til shadowkeep on sept 17 where everything will be cheaper for a limited time
---
Outbreak perfected and whisper are the easiest. Whisper i think can only be done on the weekends though. Dont quote me on that.
---
You get one. It basically starts your character at Forsaken. You can buy more but they cost like $40 worth of silver.
---
I did this mission today also, I wish they would use these places in the open world and not locked behind missions
---
Boosts you to lvl 30.  Light 300
---
I tried starting outbreak but there is a kink the accessing of it. I watched dattos' video of it but that didnt help much. Do you know of any better walkthroughs? Could be a hiccup on my end though.
---
So halo basically lol
---
Best Shader to put on recluse?
---
The only things that are seasonal are the seasonal events. All annual pass content is available anytime just the same as all of your vanilla destiny content is.
---
Seasonal exclusives are ONLY eververse cosmetics and seasonal events like the dawning.
---
So yes you can do thorn, the last word, and everything else.
---
When the opposing team has their primevil up wait until they begin DPS then invade with a machine gun and it should be relatively easy to wipe them while they are all in the well of light.
---
Y-yes?
---
Whats the problem? If it is accessing the data pad or whatever you need to spare a fallen captain at the end of a titan adventure.
---
Hey, so...
---
Sounds like you need to do a repair to your game and ensure you have a solid connection. Not something I have heard of, so currently this seems to be limited to you.
---
ahh shit, i have a solid connection. and i repaired my game and it said everything was fine. it also takes a long time to load into some strikes and so on. not sure if that helps

So pretty much getting through the first door to get to the quest lol. Like he mentioned it and said I would possibly need to switch characters or reload it to open it up. Not sure why it is being difficult Its really just annoying. I know.he also said there is a quest I would potentially have to had completed prior to opening it up so I'm not sure if it is on my not
---
I feel like Outbreak Perfected and Whisper are actually two of the hardest exotic quests. 
---
The other person is wrong about having to spare a fallen captain, that's not what you have to do. [What you actually have to do.](https://old.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/bmruj0/fallen_transponderzero_hour_frequently_asked/)
---
Thank you!
---
Do you know what the quest is called? Is it called ‚Äúthe upward turn?‚Äù
---
You get more ghost bits and resonate stems if you do the heroic on those planets.  Also it gives you about double the clan xp on the heroic compared to the non-heroic.
---
shock and denial
---
My clan is only 7 players. We raid once a week since the beginning of Season of the Drifter. 3x Riven with a Heart run and 1 SotP. So far 6 of us have gotten 1KV and one with Anarchy. The person who got Anarchy has the best RNG, got it and 1KV on her first runs
---
You'd be way better off building one, it not as hard as you'd think and there are plenty of good YouTube guide videos to help.
---
My boyfriend still hates it and won't even give it a second try after soon to be two years. And I'm only playing this game because he was the one that told me to try the Destiny 2 beta with him!
---
Build your own pc, it‚Äôs a way better way to do it... but you‚Äôll have to buy all the parts, which usually works out being cheaper than buying a premise pc online!
---
Working on the last word n got spades! I appreciate it!
---
yeah maybe make the weapon magazine hold dry ice and allow it to seep through the vents down the barrel
---
So apparently you can infuse weapons out of your level into items currently equipped. Which then the game won't let you use them but wont unequip them.
---
([https://i.imgur.com/HY3x9CP.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/HY3x9CP.jpg))

It also breaks the character model, it wont load anymore.

Hey I had this exact same conversation with someone in the early hours of this last Sunday. Thought I'd see what all the fuss was about with the lord wolves after some excessive drinking and  low and behold, this guy messaged me to complain about my using it...
---
Exactly! Yeah guess thats all you can do.
---
This is peek reddit
---
Bruh, half of the original Destiny‚Äôs lore was on a website.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt that just be really slow and unrewarding anyway?
---
Nobody will learn whole raids only beacuse somebody don't want wste their time. If you don't want just play it then why you even bother repeating whole thing again and again? At some point you don't even getting better stuff from it.
---
r/HistoryMemes
---
Sadly enough... This actually looks better than most D2 Titan armor...
---
heh I forgot one of these - /s
---
Same, after the hundreds of hours between beginning of d1 to current point in d2. I've done exactly zero raids and only a handfull of nightfalls
---
from what i can gather, it means that it treats Fusion different from projectile guns where in the latter having stats described as _Rounds-per-Minute_ and FR as "time to shoot, so that's why it's described like that
---
i go to spider once a day to refill completely. i'm empty all the damn time.
---
... i havent played any of the halos and knew that was a spartan
---
Yeah I agree. I‚Äôve got quite a stock pile for the first time ever. I never used to have any. My basic rule (that I got from here) is don‚Äôt infuse until the gain is 10 light minimum. All of a sudden I have plenty of cores.
---
And any good f2p is a hacker!1

Here before this blows up

reverie dawn grasps and hauberk, strides of the great hunt,wing contender and the cloak is self explanatory

Please sir I ran out of glimmer spare change

simple answer NO.   
---
but depending on a platform you are using and where you are in the world you can get some versions around 20usd.   
---
Try something like cdkeys com, allkeyshop com, amazon com seller RushHourWholesalers has it for 19usd
---
You to *B L O W*
---
Honestly, what‚Äôs the point really? Besides wasting time?
---
If you need heroic events for quest? Then you need to use the companion app or the discord channel to LFG.
---
Nope just a randomn exotic ship Tess should havebit in the new bright engrams if you didn‚Äôt get it before
---
WHO LET BUNGIE DEVS IN
---
You can get 23 cores per character from banshee, and 6 cores from spider for the wanted bounties and if you buy 2 cores a day from him, thats an extra 14. You can make over 400 hundred cores a month doing this.
---
Sad but sometimes true üò≠
---
Just got this weapon as a drop yesterday. Seems pretty damn good!
---
Yup :) could have perfected the stock part a little if I had three hours, but I'm quite satisfied with the result
---
Well hopefully some newer players will also see this and learn something because its a cool Easter Egg.

Damn. Never knew this sub existed.

Yes moving from from bnet to steam at you dlc with come with you no worries. But if you plan to ever cross save and play on console /Pc you will have to buy it again

Hunter gang

I could do that, though I'll probably just get Shadowkeep and/or it's annual pass instead.
---
While I'm pretty annoyed at the potential loss of some supers, I'd much rather have access to the latest content instead.
---
They reset Sunday. They‚Äôre supposed to reset Tuesday but as of now they don‚Äôt.
---
They revamped the other supers as well, atm they are all useful and relevant
---
Sorry to tell you this but... They start at 750
---
Post this to /r/DestinyCreations!
---
I would probably go for small bore, accurized rounds, eye of the storm, and rangefinder. With a range masterwork. I‚Äôve heard that kind of set up makes the gun hard to fight against.
---
Ah, okay.
---
Hunnna Gang
---
Do you have you subclass? When you are in your pause menu it‚Äôs the top left thing. It will either be orange, people or blue with a symbol.
---
If it is black/gray/white, then open up your director (XBOX: hold select) and go to the ‚ÄúDestinations‚Äù Tab. Then you want to select Earth which will bring up a mission called spark I believe.
---
Game glitched. None of the enemies acknowledged my existence.
---
See I don't care about anything other than range because I'm on PC, so I have no need for stability
---
get a full fireteam, go into heroic strike playlist, don‚Äôt follow objective, head into diffrenet lost sectors grind; if Corrupted strike, do tier 3 blind well
---
Yes if u bought the collection with the annual pass, if that‚Äôs what you are referring to, it will work.
---
Fr? Matchmaker on Xbox is full of cretins, if you want a clean and comprehensive raid run you got to the lfg App
---
Yeah, I figured there was a lot of people selling the codes and people just not caring about dropping the $150 for the thing. But the raid is fun, Bungie outdid them selves with it. I just didnt have the time to kill my self over the grind to do it in a week.

I prefer sturm &amp; drang as my weapon and the hunter with the way of a thousand cuts. I wear an exo chest that allows me to carry a second knife to throw so i can use one while the other recharges or maybe i miss once in a while. Primarily i use sturm and drang tho because i dont have to reload, i just habe to switch weapons and make a kill. In case I am out of ammo or have to reload i still have my knifes.
---
How‚Äôs the new hand cannon?
---
It took me longer than it should've to figure it out

I have absolutely no idea how to get this all installed. Downloaded Rainmeter and I am so confused lol, does anyone know how to get this all installed properly?
---
Thar guy is the reason i bought forsaken .
---
Hasn‚Äôt worked almost 2 weeks now. You can /addfriend then type their bnet to add them and then join off of your friends list
---
Ok. How about another page for just the good normal exotics then?
---
And what do you use?
---
I wish but we would get copyrighted
---
It‚Äôs a great game that has it downfall in the drop rates of guns like that. 
---
If you grind got the Luna or Forgotten...recluse, I get that. You put in the time and frustration. We I get smoked by those guns, it‚Äôs acceptable, in my opinion. 
---
But with Exotics...you‚Äôre at the mercy of the drop. Add the onslaught of snipers no more than ever...you‚Äôre screwed. Only defense is to back off from the LOW...the. You get Beloved right in the dome. 
---
Not a enjoyable time in PvP. right now, I agree. 
---
But nerfing just makes it less exotic, which is counterproductive. It‚Äôs a conundrum, if you enjoy the game.
---
1. Lord of Wolves is 110% RNG from Spider Bounties, aka. a game-system that is very much accesible to the "average player". Being an "average player" has literally **nothing** to do with whether or not you have Lord of Wolves. Now, the *majority* of players might not have Lord of Wolves, but that's another metric entirely...
---
2. I complain (sorta), and is not a streamer or youtuber (though I did upload that music back in 9th grade, I guess...). So do plenty of my friends, due to its dominance in PvP atm. You consider streamers/youtubers to be the only ones due to exposure. This phenomenon ain't exactly new... 
---
3. The "average player" (why do you love this term, btw?) probably doesn't have god aim, no. Then again, to dominate a fair amount of PvP matches with Lord of Wolves in its current state you don't **need** god aim. Just, you know... decent to good aim, which most fps players develop naturally (based on experience, mind you, no hard stats, sorry!)
---
I won't straight up argue with the validity of your post, but it does rely heavily on assumptions, which really doesn't (or, at least rarely does) lead to meaningful discussions. Just my 2 cents.
---
This looks almost like starbound
---
You only need to reach brave for mt and Redrix doesn‚Äôt have a comp requirement anymore.
---
Right now I'm using the risk runner and nameless midnight
---
"at least one player who uses"  hardly meets the requirement for "meta."  Players have been bitching about shotgun sliders since D1.  Which is where most of us learned how to counter them.  We also learned not to hop right out into a sniper lane.  Save your drama for your mamma.

You need to kill 24 watchers in the leviathan and fight siviks in the bergusia to get the Izanagi.

Malfeasance: This one is very simple. Just play Gambit Classic until you get to

I have never reset my Valor ever, 100% positive, no doubt whatsoever. I have the Chaperone.

Bungie are the ones who made the pvp mode. Not sure why you're complaining to me because you're upset there's pvp in the game.

Bungo has brought back the moon and it truly is haunted

Im sorry for your loss!
---
On Izanagi, I did say I wouldn't be going into the quest steps, because i'm sure people can read.

On Malfeasance, I have no idea what happened there, I typed in that you need to kill the Servitor Primeval and do the quest steps from there, guess it just didn't want to go through.
---
 Forsaken. You get new subclasses and a ton of exotics. We don‚Äôt really know anything about Shadowkeep.

And we know how well that went on the Moon...Crota wiped his ass with us. We won in the end, but at what cost? *At what cost?!?*

Technically, it IS wrong when his original wording was "You need all of the nodes to get the sword". That is 100% false. He didn't say "If you get all 45, you can get the sword", THEN you would be correct. But he specifically worded it as "You need to collect ALL nodes for the sword".

Thanks for trying to correct me though.

Menagerie menagerie menagerie and farm runes (i've seen people on crucible quickplay farming them pretty easily but i'm not really sure how to farm them properly sorry) to get 700+ gear and weapons
---
For Malfeasance, it might be helpful to specify that the quest is dropped from the "*Ascendant Primeval Servitor"* (or "Meatball"), which has an increased chance of spawning during high curse week (when Petra is in Rheasilvia).

The only way I could think of is finding an old physical copy in a brick and mortar store. It's currently not possible to get *just* the base game if you don't have it already. 
---
As for getting into D2, I would say there are three options. Wait until the base game and year 1 DLC become free in September, or purchase the $40 USD complete collection (includes all currently available content), or purchase the Legendary collection (includes Forsaken) from a third party vendor such as amazon. In the official store, the legendary collection is more expensive than the complete collection, it is only cheaper from third party vendors.

I‚Äôve never played more than the minimum for weekly powerfuls and thus have never reset and I‚Äôve played since PC release. I have the quest and got it from Amanda as we‚Äôll randomly. I want to say it happened at the end of a match that was unremarkable.

It's possible to throw the batteries directly into the forge from the islands. Might take a couple of tries to get it right but since I usually find teammates through the matchmaking and their ability could be great or awful, I learned to throw straight in. Also helps people that are on top if they're too busy with ads.

Just forge the frame in the Bergusia forge

Should I put off doing this stuff until I'm at 700? If so, what event should I do instead to get there a little faster?
---
it would be nice if bungie would add him in as an NPC like elder scrolls did, just as a sign of respect.
---
i‚Äôm really sorry for your loss man.
---
I suppose I could practice doing that. It'll take a ton of tries, though.
---
Yes. what platform are you on?
---
I haven't done it for a while, but off of memory, aiming for the outer ring on the center platform it usually curves into the forge pretty well.
---
Lol. If you're letting a team have time to team shot you in your GG, you're doing something wrong. This might be a case of hunter-itis.
---
 "Ugh I can't aim and keep dying even though I can one shot anybody instantly. Buff pls bungo"
---
People like you are why fist of havoc and spectral blades got so good. "I'm bad with this so it must be bad"
---
I'll give that a try if I have no luck. Or, I guess I could just wait until I'm a higher light lvl and matchmake that way. Didn't realize that was my problem, just thought no one was interested in this content.

Iron Banner is next week! I would finish it up in IB. Ikelos was the best Void HC for me.
---
it's about to be LoW come Iron Banner
---
Ah I see, thanks you the tip

If you got the Rat King, it should be in your primary slot. I'm assuming you haven't. If you open up the menu with the map and destinations on it, the pursuits tab should be on the very left. The quest step is very vague, so I would recommend using a guide to figure it out.
