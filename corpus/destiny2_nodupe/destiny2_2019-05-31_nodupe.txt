Fuck yes

I tried but the lag just infuriates me on pc.

Here‚Äôs each individual subclass!

I also forgot to factor in Triple Infamy. Is it essentially the regular Infamy gain with all factors multiplied by 3?
---
My first full completion of LW with my clan (as I only finished the first two encounters my previous attempts with them around the launch of the raid.) I got the curated pulse, sparrow, and 1k voices. They were a bit salty.
---
Yeah, D1 exotics we're really mild by comparison to the kind we have now- which make it really fun for pve but a problem in pvp. And pinnacle weps ugh
---
I think part of the reason pvp was 'good' in d1 was because they were jumping off Halo, and lots of halo people were playing destiny which gave it a deeper player pool. There was also more choice in playlists which also helped. 
---
There's also this nostalgic tinge you know? It was the first of its kind. You could forgive the fuckups and things. But I think if that same pvp environment was still around today people would be bitching all the time just like they do now.
---
I hope that, for the benefit of people like you, that they do have more structured pvp in D3 and learn from these mistakes. I just don't foresee it changing in this game now. I can't imagine how hard it was for them to change it as much as they have already. Keep hoping for the best, dude üëç I wish you well
---
Ok
---
Noice.
---
Wrecked cactus
---
No, comp will work as is.
---
But revoked will be a point based system where the glory points you gain are constantly added up while you can‚Äôt lose any.
---
So you could reach fabled but have gotten revoker
---
Oh
---
Saw someone say in a post that thats only for the quest step. You will still lose glory for taking a loss.
---
Do the daily and weekly bounties. Talk to Driftysauce in tower he has bounties to get you to 640.
---
Its not like they snuck the maintenance in at the last second.
---
This happened to me the other day, ended up losing 5 motes but at least I killed someone with 10
---
They fixed it but it looks terrible on everything.
---
As a high schooler myself, I feel this is in my soul
---
I know. That's why I said "I should've seen it coming". Because I knew it was coming. Just didn't realize they boot you mid match.
---
It‚Äôs only in pve so it's not like you'll notice anything in crucible.
---
I love how you got the relentless invader medal even though you killed him before the telportation haha
---
Public events
---
huh, ally cabal is an interesting concept.
---
something i always liked about warframe was how you could be hired by the enemy factions to help them in missions, for me it's interesting and fun to put differences aside for mutual benefit from time to time.
---
Where can we find it?
---
Hell yeah congrats!
---
No joke I spend like 30 seconds trying to produce a middling mote, glad to hear this.
---
Driftysauce?
---
Drifter in Tower Annex
---
Did you do the boosted bounties?
---
I thought he just did that dumb gambit stuff that I have to pay butt loads of money for
---
The what with a what now?
---
Na
---
Back in the destiny 1 days, I had some friends completely carry me through my very first nightfall. Got gjallarhorn off the boss lmao
---
I think each weapon/armor should only take x number of cores for master working or infusing.  So, let‚Äôs say 20 (as an example).  Once you put 20 in, no more cores are needed for that specific weapon/armor piece for further infusions or master working.  But that‚Äôs just one idea ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
The single one I don't have is Loaded Question,and I have 100 arc kills between me and that thing.
---
What‚Äôs your gt maybe I have
---
I have one of those too! Mine is an EDZ Ghost shell.
---
xXFusion4LifeXx
---
Only 14 clears and i just got my 3rd 1k voices, on my time i had a guy who had 94 clears, i could feel his anger.
---
Cuz Last Word iz ze best gun in Destini
---
On his post history
---
That actually sounds familiar I‚Äôm 95% sure we have
---
BOW YA SHITS!
---
Unfortunately, I don't.
---
YAAASHHHHHH!!!!!!
---
Oohhh boy. I remember you using that same emblem too
---
Calling it right now, if he dies, he's going to be killed by a Taken he personally summoned, the scene with the Taken Captain was foreshadowing that.
---
When you're in a clan with a member that gets the weapon every single time, its more rare for him not to get it. Have done the raid 11 times. He has gotten the weapon 9 times.
---
&gt;My buddy tells me that's a huge mistake, because I won't have access to any y2 content once y3 starts on the next annual pass. That doesn't make any sense to me.
---
You would be correct. They don't just *take away* DLC after a certain time, does any game do that, lol? It would be a horrible deal! 
---
It's like how Curse of Osiris still exists, even though we are in year 2.
---
It was weird how okay Ghost was with us murdering swaths of enemies for 4 straight years but suddenly killing Uldren and the Barons is a path he's not comfortable with us following
---
LMAO just leave the raid, he won't get to suck up your time or money and will wilt away
---
That's what I'm saying! Adamantly arguing with me that anything released under y2s annual pass will be locked and unnatainable. I'm trying to explain that just doesn't make sense as a business model also but, I guess someone higher light told him that, who apparently follows their twitter.
---
Dude!! Have you turned them in yet? If you haven't WAIT!!
---
Since the "exotic hand cannon" line shows up about half a second before the gun enters the scene, I did not think an actual one would appear. This meme delivered beyond expectations.
---
Well, I am at the maximum light (700) if that helps, haha.
---
Definitely helps me XD I think he's just trying to convince me to buy the pass sooner, but he's one of those people that are basicly rushing to max light. Telling me I won't be able to do scourge or last wish or gambit prime even if i buy y3s annual pass so I need to buy it now _._
---
I don't think they'll call it the Eyasluna, but yeah, the model is coming back
---
That's happened to me a few times with multiple weapons. Are you by chance doing the catalyst right now? It's only ever happened to me when I was doing a catalyst.
---
Any meme that uses Overlord gets auto upvote
---
My friend invited me to riven(not the raid just riven), I fucked up queens walk and got it first chest
---
I had like 4 helmets in a row and 2 leg armour together for clearing weekly and infamy rank up. Kill me pls.
---
Repost.
---
I‚Äôm calm, I did laugh at the ‚Äúautism blades‚Äù which I do love a lotüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
This is a personal attack. Was my first PC raid, not d2 raid though. But yeah 1k first try.
---
I mean they did nerf Spectral
---
Just buy it 4Head
---
I love this. 
---
You'll love this.
---
Kalli is literally a small example of how thrilling the raid gets as you get deeper and deeper. 
---
Shurochi will be a struggle for sure no doubt about that. Watch some YouTube videos to see what Shurochi is like.
---
And also I recommend you do leviathan (all 3) and scourge of the past. 
---
The d2 app is available on Google play or Apple apps or whatever.
---
Those were cool. Set a standard for how all missions should be. We can't just immediately forgive bungie for finding a pearl in a sea of trash.
---
Why are you still playing, just play a different game.
---
Yep, just over 50 percent
---
Or Spectard Blades is another one ive seen üòÇ
---
That may be true, but people that good can do the same thing with any other weapon.
---
Hell no. That concept is annoying if you ask me, just let me play a match and not have to do a new match after I die in the first minute
---
That is so frustrating seeing as how limited the time between reckoning events is.
---
It was more of a rough estimation hahaha, but yeah i stopped around forsaken start
---
I doubt we‚Äôd have one but I can see maybe a Minecraft Hunger Games style working. A small-ish arena with lots of gear for a more fast paced battle royale among a small player count.
---
Calm your tits folks, it‚Äôs gonna be a big hype up. Don‚Äôt pre order, wait to see what it actually delivers.
---
Highly recommend watching Overlord, I'm hooked.
---
Yeah that'd be fun, i wish i could make developers see this.
---
The devs tend to look at r/DestinyTheGame more often from what I‚Äôve seen. Might try your luck there but tbh it can get toxic over there.
---
Protect the Runner - bank 75(?) motes without dying
---
Bruh I got the last Braytech weapon yesterday. Had all previously with me and equipped. Good luck. It will drop for you.
---
Just putting my words here the same thing happened to me I.e. the truth to power lore not dropping.
---
The boss should have one of these in their name: Aspect or Hate, Aspect of Pain, or Aspect of War.
---
There's only 2 more exotics HCs left to port over, Hawkmoon and The First Curse, so stay chill.
---
I entirely agree with you. It was a nightmare grinding 2100 glory as a solo player, and I don‚Äôt think I will ever want to do that again. But guess I‚Äôll have to if I want mountaintop. Anyway, I‚Äôm really glad they did this in stead of another fabled glory rank. This is way better.
---
I accidentally got that one not knowing I needed to do it! 
---
Nice! I only need the ghost shell for Cursebreaker. I have Dredgen and Wayfarer and I‚Äôm so close to getting two more but so far...
---
Dont think its per daily reset. More like once in 24hrs? I spent all my stems and didnt have any drop after reset ( i collect it 1hr before reset btw).
---
Could be just rng but if you want to be safe. Do it every 2 days lol
---
This is quite confusing to read.
---
Go to your Playing the Odds emblem, it‚Äôll be an option underneath once that one is equipped. It‚Äôs a sub emblem on the main Gambit one.
---
Awe piss. So I'm assuming that means I only have 3 days left for a shot at recluse? Anyone good at comp want to throw me some live on Xbox? I'm at 1354
---
Just about how it feels to play Titan.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
We look cool, but we don't fit anywhere :(
---
With that said, I think players who bail should be punished. I would even say: disconnects get somewhat punished while abandons (as in ‚Äúholding _ Button to abandon activity‚Äù) should be punished with points.
---
Right side of wrong is a bit more reliable üòéüòÇ
---
Sorry, but what about sturm having nearly infinite charges shots that deal twice what they did previously
---
&gt; I keep bouncing between 1500 and 1200
---
me to bro! im not good enought to sway the win our direction and i cant be arsed to join a sherpa
---
Wair, so are these new changes going to apply to the recluse as well? Or just the new pinnacle weapon?
---
Tackle counts as melee, bottom tree regens health after a melee kill. FoH lasts at least as long as tackle if you're getting any kills at all.
---
And it's not much easier to get kills with spectral, you have an autoaim tackle and a big AoE if needed
---
Better then Gaybreak
---
Anyone playing on your account doesn't have the same incentive to follow the rules that you have. I have seen many people get a ban days after using paid recov services or letting someone else play on their account because that other player used exploits or network manipulation in order to complete the task faster. Also, some people would just think it's funny to say "Sure I'll do it for you!" and then delete your perfect rolls, mats, or do anything to get your account banned just for a laugh. I've seen it happen a TON on other MMO games I've played in the past.
---
/r/CrucibleSherpa exists. You don't need to pay for a carry, for Crucible or for PvE.

---
There's more Not Forgottens in qp than in comp, it's ridiculous
---
I don‚Äôt really like the change. I‚Äôm a solo casual player to the bone. But I like the current grind. I don‚Äôt have Luna‚Äôs or mountain top, but I appreciate the progression I‚Äôve made so far. I started the Luna‚Äôs quest last week and I‚Äôm currently on the solar kills quest. It‚Äôs very refreshing because I never play as a sun Breaker. And I‚Äôm realizing I never use solar weapons so forcing out of my comfort zone is helping a bunch. Even the hand cannon kills helped me aim better with my Duke and trust combo. I‚Äôve even progressed a bit with the last word. All the while my glory rank has steadily gone up. Yes losing because of afk teammates, 3 man teams, and guitar errors sucks. I was on a 4 streak 2 days ago and lost when I got booted to orbit. I still enjoy it, tilt and all. I take the good with the bad in comp because that‚Äôs the idea. Sweaty, git gud, curb stomp, dust rock, spectral, kick my ass comp. it should stay difficult. Not inclusive. You should feel like you‚Äôre walking into a lions den with a slim Jim body wash. Too me pinnacle weapons are the apex rewards. You shouldn‚Äôt be able to attain them from just sticking with it. If you can‚Äôt progress your skills and build up your load out to compliment a fluid and diverse play style you shouldn‚Äôt get these top tier weapons. Comp shouldn‚Äôt feel like a nightfall or even a raid, where you can just play For a while, suck balls all the way through, get carried through the attrition, and just wind up with top tier content. If you wanna play sometime add me on ps:LeFlii
---
I do a bit of everything but I haven‚Äôt unlocked 2 of the forges. And haven‚Äôt done two raids/Lairs. And I‚Äôm down to get fucked in comp
---
The point of pinnacle weapons in crucible is that you have to be good to get them. It shouldn't just be a time investment, you should have skill too. Not sure how I feel about this.
---
Hey, you might check out r/fireteams as it's made for finding others to play with, and LFG posts aren't allowed on this sub.
---
Sorry, I'm on console and can't help. Good luck though!

A guy I was playing with got 1KV on his first Last Wish run, but we were all happy that at least *someone* in our group got it, even though we all deserved it more.
---
Link to twab?
---
We're still in Season of the Drifter, so not much has changed as far as I recall. You might check out the [TWAB](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/buzcp4/this_week_at_bungie_05302019/) from yesterday that gives details of changes coming this Tuesday.
---
I mean, you can fairly consistently one-tap a guardian with an erentil. Fusions really only need the pve buff imo
---
F its a titan, ruuuuuuunnnnnnnn
---
It's being increased with the next update
---
What are you peaople storing in there every single Gun and armor piece? I play a shit ton and I Save pretty much every god roll I get but i still have half of my vault left (around 1.3k hours of playtime)
---
My team: not this
---
Enemy team: this 60/60/24/7
---
Nope, i've seen alot of them
---
why do you resort to personal insults ?
---
I take that for granted previously. Used to had 400 of them and now im out with still no sniper lol
---
And promptly get eaten by all the thrall flooding in because you cant shoot though a soild object.
---
Or get stomped by the boss on other side
---
Or go flying anyway because?? _(this one made me give up on the mode)
---
The mode is just bad. Sometimes bungie just get it wrong and this was one
---
GUARDIANS....assemble
---
Nice
---
eciN
---
I disagree I rather enjoy it because it requires a little more attention and strategy. I understand why people don't like it though.
---
it is the legendary wall, it has ruined lives of gaurdians forever
---
Bruh what? Anyone can go into comp and get their pinnacle weapon, they just need to practice. And I‚Äôm not rude for saying comp is for skilled pvp players. Any pve player that wants the weapon needs to work for it like the rest of us do. If you are not good for said weapon, then work for it. Same goes for a pvp player that wants to do a raid but can‚Äôt because he is too lazy to know the mechanics. If you got hurt because I called out what competitive for what really is, then you should stay in qp and practice so you can get the pinnacle weapon, otherwise your statement is invalid.
---
Hold up
---
Ma dood
---
THAT WAS AWESOME
---
Yeah the huge green halo on the reaper set isn‚Äôt a dead giveaway .....
---
Should have waited until Tuesday because it would have dropped higher
---
&gt;FoH, which is a garbage super in PvP
---
yeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaa, no
---
also where do you get the hammers in FoH?
---
pretty much lol
---
My question is does this mean you wont lose any points in comp even for quest lines like lunas nf and recluse?
---
Yeah I just love the game but dont grind for materials and ive recently reached fabled and when all the pinnacle weapons wanted me to do comp I I realized this and I'm just a bit annoyed I thought that after reaching fabled and getting the pinnacles o would have a ton but I only had 200
---
Yeah man. Once you hit Heroic it quickly gets insane
---
Other than practice, you may try watching some videos or streams and try to watch how a higher skilled/experienced plays. I remember back when I played Halo a lot, from watching my friend play I learned to use my grenades more effectively and anticipate my enemies actions. So you might learn some small strategies, or see a different playstyle you hadn't thought of before and be able to incorporate it.
---
Also, don't underestimate the basics. I remember when I first started playing I wasn't all that great with the Warlock jump/glide, but after attempting a particularly difficult jumping puzzle in one of the Ascendant Challenges, it became second nature to me to trigger the glide on/off when needed to make super accurate jumps. This helped immensely in PvP, and made it so I wasn't the last straggler when doing platforming in raids. 
---
Last tip, learn when to duck and cover. At first I was triggering my Healing Rifts just in time for me to die. But now I'm better about placement near cover, and using it preemptively.
---
Because the pull of the melee counters the stomp...and you have to be in the melee range. Although useful, it's only useful when you have eyes on the enemy stomping and be in that range. They shouldn't be able to stomp that strongly to begin with, it should just be a slight push back. That way, only unsuspecting guardians that don't try to recover are the only ones that can die.
---
This literally make Glory pointless. There's no difference between Glory and Valor anymore. Guess it's good they nerfed Not Forgotten now that they're giving it away
---
Meh. I don‚Äôt care, just means less reason to get to Fabled unless I decide I care enough to pursue Luna‚Äôs next season. Doubt it, especially with it getting a nerf though.
---
Worst part of the DLC imo
---
Yo, I like the placing of the three warlocks in the middle, one looking up, one down, and one straight at the viewer. It loos so epic. 
---
Plus the burning maul titan and the arcstrider look sweet, you really nailed their dynamic movements
---
Sh.... Don't tell bungo. Well I already got my third char to 700 using 700 level thunderlord
---
Season of Memes confirmed.
---
Primeval Damage is a measure of engagement 
---
Not a measure of actual Damage relative to Primeval Health. 
---
If you shot a single HC bullet and your team didn't shoot at all,  itd say 100%.
---
I thought this article from a week or so ago may be helpful:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/bqlbeo/perfecting_your_positioning_a_guide_on_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
Otherwise, some of ‚Äúgame sense‚Äù just comes from exposure/experience, not just with destiny, but other FPS.  Hang in there.
---
He means that if in the last round OP's team summoned the primeval and OP shot him like 10 times with a primary, and a couple of his teammates shot him like 1 time with a primary, OP would still have a huge percentage of the primeval damage. 
---
One of the other pages actually shows how much damage in numbers everyone did to the primeval.
---
When I was reading that this was my exact reaction
---
Can you explain this to me a little better? 3500 glory. Isn't that already fabled rank? And how won't you lose points if you lose?
---
I did it the normal way.. I‚Äôm not getting my friends to cheat with me
---
Asking you a question because I'm genuinely concerned with your mental health isn't an insult
---
Thank you so much, means a lot cos I used this piece to really practice getting more dynamic poses (even if some are better than others üòÑ)
---
Well there‚Äôs a bunch of seasonal eververse armor and iron banner armor you can‚Äôt get again since it‚Äôs random rolled.  It‚Äôs also not immediately clear what the best rolls are for new guns, particularly if it‚Äôs a gun type you don‚Äôt typically play or new perks that were just introduced ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
That's not gonna hold up in court.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs agressive frame, but yeah you‚Äôre right, it still is a bit easy. Hoping something like redrix‚Äôs broadsword quest
---
Don't suppose i could ride that train a bit? I really just want recluse
---
Agreed, and titles obviously are always an easy reward
---
Dam.
---
Am I the only one excited that swords can have more ammo reserve?  Deus Vult!
---
My bad
---
Xbox unfortunately.
---
Thank you though
---
Thats a difference of opinion, i play video games fundamentally different than you do clearly :) no wrong way to play lol, i dont even use handcannons, or autoweapons but solod my way to each gun each season just to have them
---
You have that totally useful and not at all terrible at all Mida Multi Tool catalyst if you don't already have it. /s
---
But I see your point. There's gotta be something at the end of that tunnel of pain. If you've already got your NF, there's no real incentive to do it. And it's been months since people had a reason.
---
I have claimed all completed triumphs.
---
Nobody looks at your character. 
---
Nobody cares what cosmetics you have on, what shaders, your ghost projection... that's all for you. 
---
If you're going to jump into a quickplay with random teammates and you want to play a certain way, you need to communicate a strategy and not assume they are mindreaders.
---
I'm crazy to expect humans to practice open and clear communication though.
---
So I‚Äôm a bit confused. Does this mean:
---
-Comp will stay the way it is, where you lose points for losing a game, but this is just saying that losing games will not lose quest progress
---
or
---
-You will no longer lose points in Glory ranking from losing games of Comp
---
Of course you could
---
RELAX GUARDIAN! YOURE SCARING THEM.
---
I suppose, but I feel you should need to do something special and not just a time investment
---
Is this lifetime points or do I have to grind comp again?
---
Blue or green kinetic grenade launcher?
---
Irrelevant, find one you like
---
Why not just a legendary?
---
Lol, no biggie! I figured that was exactly what you meant, just wanted to make sure!
---
Well you have that new map on titan. Lots of tight corridors and walls blocking you from the perfect shot.
---
And I wasn't denying it
---
that‚Äôs more than what I was expecting thanks man!
---
Ihu
---
I‚Äôm unaware of any legendary kinetic grenade launchers that aren‚Äôt Moutaintop or Militias that are legendary, but if there are some I‚Äôve forgotten about you can use those too, the idea is just to grab a launcher that is much more powerful than fighting lion, 3 is better than 2
---
Well u said irrelevant after I asked If u meant grenade launchers...
---
Bad ass change
---
Huh I just checked the collections not even the blue green or white are kinetic, I‚Äôm sorry
---
For some reason I don't believe them...
---
Oh no! I have a 45% comp win rate!
---
Deep Six? What? The only walls are the rotundas which are very light on the heat map, most of the action is in the combat arenas until the primeval spawns, even such deep six is worse because you spawn so far away, so you can safely use your super, and just ride the rotating device that goes around the whole map and quickly come up on the target
---
I‚Äôve used every invasion strategy you can think of on every character, there is no map that is bad or even mediocre for hunters
---
I have 3% win rate
---
From what I read, it‚Äôs getting nerfed again.
---
Pinnacle weapons should be hard to get
---
Another source you can try is the rare forge bounties for the Dreaming city that Ada-1 gives every week
---
WTF Xur? 
---
Well, I guess there is a first time for everything. 
---
**PSA:** 
---
If you have the legendary shards for it, always buy ~~the gun and~~ the armor for your class if you do not have them yet **before buying the fated engram.** Otherwise, there is a chance you will get the gun or armor piece from the fated engram. You can tell if you have an item by looking under the "exotics" tab of Collections in-game.
---
This is overall an *extremely* underwhelming selection of exotics. Wings are one of the base game mission rewards you can pick between on Titan, and in my opinion the least good of the three that Sloane offers. All three Aeon gauntlets are *very* ineffective, and are the Curse of Osiris campaign reward. Not sure about Fr0st-EE5.
---
Probably around 120 or more games if you win around 50% of matches. If you lose a match you don't gain any points.
---
Yeah, more of a participation award. They should have just put it in Quickplay.
---
Nah. If you want in on the group then you need to earn your way in. Not just a participation trophy.
---
I've never seen anyone do this before
---
this is what they should have done from the start
---
It doesn't go down on a loss, but like Gambit we can assume you won't gain rank from a loss either. Wins are what matter...and in that regard I don't agree with you, or him. You've gotta win to progress. You just don't lose rank on a loss. You're still gonna get the same sweaty experience regardless. There's more insentive to get non-comp players to join the fight.
---
How it‚Äôs felt for the entirety of D2.
---
Yeah we do. This is just seperate points
---
At this point they should just make it a Quickplay reward since is basically just a participation award.
---
Yeah only for the quest. The ranking system will still be the same
---
Ah, you‚Äôd probably want to contact the seller then.
---
You think I should delete it?
---
You still need to win matches to get points. You don't get comp points if you lost a match. So you will still rely on your team mates because it's a team based game. 
---
If you constantly have bad team mates then the problem may be no further than a look in the mirror.
---
How many times do we need to teach you this lesson old man!?
---
No it doesn't.
---
One of these days he will find his will.  He just has to go out and be good at hunting to find his will.
---
No lol. You still lose points like normal for your rank but on your quest you won't.
---
Would have used the kid napping scene from chitty chitty bang bang
---
Only took 2 days for lunas and recluse for me as well. Pretty easy to do.
---
You speak the truth
---
OEM was last week. This weeks exotics are pretty trash. Hell, one is a quest reward for doing the Osiris story.
---
I was in a discord and someone said that you can get by with only 8 wins per week
---
No you pick up the quest in a secret room during the adventure called "Enemy of My Enemy" on titan, you don't have to wait at all just go in and grab it anytime.
---
Yeah what these guys said. A 240gb is minimum spec. I put a 500gb Samsung evo in my xbox and its so fast
---
No it‚Äôs actually a pink and black striped dress/ top thing.
---
Well I main titans and destiny has just been a huge part of my life. In fact focusing on it a few years ago distracted me from a lot of bad times. And I made great friends there. I‚Äôm now with someone who loves the game too and we get to spend days lounging around playing together and knocking eachother off the map. Honestly it‚Äôs been a big part of my life even if I end up not playing, I‚Äôll look back on the tattoo and remember everything :)
---
Thank you, just ran it like 5 or 6 times today and nothing. Ran it yesterday and got one but its got outlaw and threat detector so its ok but not the one I want. Thanks for the help.
---
Np np
---
Pve players when they go into pvp be like
---
My friends and I used to joke that the Nine was just Xur's name for his nine ended peenor and that he wanted strange coins which vibrate because he kept a roll of them up his butt.
---
Then nobody that bad using jotunn should ever kill you

Is why I never bought it. Once I seen the dimensions I'm like hold up.. this a Keychain? üòÇ

Truth to power can only be obtained from the throne room chest during full curse. 30 weeks start to finish, welcome to time gated triumphs. I have to wait to get unbroken because of the time gating
---
That‚Äôs been the case since D1, though. Sometimes Xur sells something great, most of the time it‚Äôs pretty worthless. Not sure why everyone chooses now to suddenly get bent out of shape about it.
---
You can only get one truth to power lore during strong curse weeks (shattered throne weeks). Can't get 3 by doing all 3 characters. So to answer the question, Yes getting chronicler is going to take a long time if you haven't done any of these yet. 
---
The next truth to power week is going to be next week.
---
Who makes rules bout no healing?
---
It's *roll*. Not 'role'.
---
And Rule 7 - - No advertising.
---
Cheesing the wish wall I see.

Didnt read ig

Nice redrix pin, did you get that one off Etsy? I think the person making them had to take them down and rename a bunch of their stuff. The shop used to use the actual names of the weapons for the prints and pins before and now they all have generic names and the pins are no longer for sale. I really wanted a redrix pin personally.

This isn't an LFG sub.

Rule 14.

All of our rules are posted on the sidebar.
---
None of that is the last step for that quest.
---
Makes sense, thanks for the tips.
---
Are you joking? Because looking at this post I honestly couldn‚Äôt tell.
---
That striker about to slam the whole team lmao
---
PvP
---
It‚Äôs an acquired taste even though I love it it does have flaws like its clip of 8 is terrible and without the catalyst it‚Äôs unusable
---
Lmao last time this happened I was still chasing No Land Beyond I was beyond hyped for Xur to show up bc he was selling it frequently but I kept missing out. Super hyped to find I stayed up for literally nothing. Good ole days
---
I like it.
---
1st no trials of the nine. Now no nine exotic guns!? I sense someone plotting against the gaurdians
---
Ok, in that case, having certain amounts of resilience only helps in very select situations. For example, having resilience above 4 stops you from being two shot with Ace of Spades charged up bullets. It's not like you think, it's a very minor increase in health. 
---
What you have to do is hit headshots, and not be shot at by more than one person at a time. If it feels like you are being vaporized and not able to kill anyone, this would probably be why.

When Cayde-6 is dead but you already bought his whole stock üéâ
---
What I wanna know is how you have everything else and the 40 matches done without the 40 being the last thing
---
I did Strange Terrain for the NF weapon about 100+ times without it dropping. Just for Wayfarer too.
---
But did they forget about Euron's fleet?
---
FUCKING FINALLY!
---
beacuse he stoped using ar's after 49 games ?
---
Ah thanks brother gonna try to get my hands on one!
---
It a strange world we live in. The best way to help Cayde is not to help him at all.
---
For sure. Its definitely one if my favorites. It's got pretty dang good stability and I find myself using it quite a lot.
