Hey, solo que is fun in crimson. Fighting lion is amazing since the enemies stay huddled together. OR if you wanna duo w me, hmu st4gs#1497
---
I didn‚Äôt get that far in my thoughting thinks
---
Btw shader for warlock is the sunrise warrior, new age black armory for titan and I think golden trace for the titans helmet ¬© copyright lmao üòÇ 
---
Am I wrong?
---
Well shit
---
I've been laid off by a gaming company before.
---

---
I know what it's like to work hard, months of crunch time, to make a ship date. And our reward is not a bonus check, not royalties, not a launch party, not even a thank you, but instead a pink slip. Because once that disc is on store shelves, we're just so much dead weight. You don't have to have worked for a development studio, though, to have read enough stories to know that this is utterly, utterly common. They're easy to find, and every major publisher is guilty as hell, (with *perhaps* one exception being Nintendo?)
---
So I'm completely "contrary" to Activision's -- and others' -- attitude that laying off huge swathes of people, not as an emergency matter, but just as a normal pay of their course of business. It is indefensible! 
---
Their CFO gout a fifteen *million* dollar bonus, and then they let 800 people go. There is no basement dwelling about it. 
---
You may have noticed huge crowds of literally everyone who are all being contrary together. You're maybe not the one who's woke, the one who's red-pilled, the one who's most informed person on this matter. Maybe though, you are an apologist for corporate greed.
---
Yes
---
But you already bought the game, dlcs, and annual pass. They won way before right now. I know I‚Äôm being played but for me it‚Äôs honestly too fun to stop
---

A metric ass is a very specific unit of measurement. Can you elaborate on your personal experience with previous metric asses? (Asking for school project)
---
Yep, in Warframe you farm for schematics and resources to build those schematics.  *Then* you farm for mods and the endo to upgrade those mods.  Then you farm XP on items to re-level them after you forma them so you can put more/bigger mods in them.
---
Mmhm, it's a fighter subclass called gunslinger
---
Prusa i3 mk3, slic3r
---
&gt;  Getting light level cap is pretty trivial after 1 650
---
Yeah, I am starting to get the feeling I really should have focused on a single character then used the 650 weapons from that one to give the others a boost.  Instead I kept them all within ~10 points of each other.
---
Live and learn I guess...lol
---
Thank you for the reply!
---
Everybody knows heroic events are complete RNG
---
This is rad. 
---
High hopes. Won‚Äôt see another dime from me until Trials is back. Can you honestly say it‚Äôs fair? (The Trials Scenario) Competitive is the only thing PvP players have. Quickplay sucks. IMO. All I do is play Comp. I only play PvE when I need gear for PvP. That‚Äôs not just me either. There are tons of other people that play just like that. I understand everyone has their different reasons on why they play the game but for the people that play it for the PvP I personally don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair. 
---
So I have to wait till the next weekly cycle before I can begin on a flashpoint?
---
Invitation from the Emperor, I thought the same thing. Didn't drop anything for me when I did it.
---
Let's be honest, their game isn't THAT long
---
You have 34,387 new friend requests.
---
... great. 
---
Maybe you're with the wrong girl.
---
you can set the interface to zero opacity and change weps just before you screenshot for nice clean images 
---
Same! Sitting on 649 and yesterday I got four 650 chest plates in a row from prime engrams before just shutting it all down. Quite a few people experiencing the same thing though, makes me wonder...
---
Wow nice! Im way off haha thanks
---
Yes. 
---
I‚Äôve never understood the point of having another character of the same class, does it have any superior benefits as compared to having one of each character?
---
Ohhh tysm :)

Butthole getting sticky, uh
---
I think you have to wait. I remember having to wait a week or something, next reset? Or next day. One of the 2.
---
Good luck with that
---
Great roll. Pop a shader on that bad boy and do some work.
---
Best game ever. Don‚Äôt @ me.
---
Yes. My "bias" rests with people who help work on video games for a living, at a company making record breaking profits -- not Bobby Kotick nor his CFO Dennis Durkin who just got $15,000,000 on top of whatever he gets paid normally. *That* guy keeps *his* job, but *I'm* the one with a bias?? 
---
Damn I'm so biased. Damn, damn, damn. I can feel the *bias* running through my veins.
---
Looked like the portal gun for a second there 
---
Daniella you my type of girl
---
I literally just finished reading your argument with the other reddit user. I was asking for context because at some point this reddit may become too long to want to read all the comments.
---
You have absolutely no reason to be rude with me about asking a simple question.
---
Next time add some context to your post so that users are FORCED to read comments to figure out what you meant. 
---
They have sleepers and ikelos shotguns supplied by Rasputin 
---
Just like papa drifter said. I brought my sword. 
---
The last season/this season iron banner for the hunter. Looks really good.
---
Funnily enough my son was conceived on Valentine‚Äôs Day, but it was accidental because we were shit faced and didn‚Äôt use protection. Best mistake of my life.
---
I did this when I found the Uldren ship in the lost sector in the glacial drift section of mars
---
Thank you. 
---
This explains the friend request. 
---
Amazing pve weapon. Shit for pvp, well on pc anways
---
Doesnt seem to do as much impact as it says it does. Mines a 243 light power and it cant take down a canal. Like my 233 bow
---
No. Just many, many friend request. 
---
Titan is a lot larger than Mercury.... it only seems small because most people only hang out on the two main platforms....
---
Sadness. Why are the best looking armor pieces always on the Eververse store... 
---
Honestly, it didn't boost me up that much, I was already about 590, but hey, now I can confidently say that it's won me matches and helped me get to 602
---
It is clear and so easy to follow that even a beginner like me can understand well (I don't even have a warlock lol)
---
What makes it better is I don't need to skim through a 10-min video just to see what gear he has used. Hope to see more of these for other classes!
---
I wish I remembered! All I know is it's from some point last year after they got their new office
---
Yes, you can get them next year also so don't feel rushed. 
---
I got the catalyst recently, it‚Äôs not the one I wanted, I would have preferred MIDA or Vigilance Wing
---
I didn‚Äôt know that they were bringing back black armory next year. Thanks
---
Middle of November kids are Valentine‚Äôs Day kids 
---
This is just amazing
---
That‚Äôs a lovely observation
---
I‚Äôm not a bow user, but the light boost gave me 600 PL Primes, which is amazing in my eyes
---
I have noticed they drop way more than they used to, i get like 3 a fay when i used to get 1 per 2 days
---
This needs to be a merch design
---
that was fucking dogshit
---
It‚Äôs not going away in the first place. It‚Äôs just that the focus is being changed with the season. So you can still get everything from the Black Armory when Jokers Wild comes out. 
---
You really could try one more game. You won‚Äôt lose over 40 pts for a loss so either way you‚Äôd get the weapon just might not have to wait. Just got mine this week as well and loving it. Congrats!! 
---
Now I feel dumb
---
No you‚Äôre fine. It‚Äôs a genuine question since they make it seem very tied to the season.  
---
Vehicles yes and such. The armor is from competing two frames or by having a forge polymer when you forge a weapon. 
---
Yeah just did two forges to complete a powerful bounty and didn't get any blues luckily I got some friends to help
---
Yes!! üòç
---
It really do be like that
---
If you don't have rampage the rampage spec won't do anything.  The OPs has Ambitious Assassin.
---
I don‚Äôt have time to explain what I don‚Äôt even have time to understand!
---
If you can throw an enemy into a wall in PvP, it‚Äôs almost a guaranteed kill. It can suppress abilities, so it can knock people out of super, and make them useless.
---
It increases damage dealt by all sources, 33% for solar and arc, and 50% void. 
---
Le Monarque can drop at any forge. As far as I know, Jotunn only drops in Bergusia. 
---
Not seeing a cake there Mr. 199 days
---
I got it then, unfortunately it isn‚Äôt anymore 
---
My man Kargen on the ledge and shit
---
But doesn't Titan armor generally give more resilience than the other class's armor? I thought Titans get more resilience, Hunters get more mobility, and Warlocks get more recovery.
---
If you're on PS4, you can also use /r/FireteamsPS4 or if you're on PC you can use this discord server (must have link previews enabled in discord settings to join) https://discord.gg/ccPgAZ
---
Titan here also, but im in the small minority excited for the nerf, don‚Äôt you think it will be good to have more choices for exotics at the competitive level? I‚Äôm tired of being ‚Äúforced‚Äù to use OEM simply because it‚Äôs too good not to. Can‚Äôt wait for it to be possible to compete with synthocepts and stuff. 
---
While you can craft any weapon in that forge so i guess it can drop if you didn‚Äôt have it already but Jotunn only drops from Bergusia. 
---
Well good for you for having good rng and damn real cool subreddit here
---
That‚Äôs a good way to think about, I agree. 
---
You're funny
---
#IT'S TIME TO ATTACK!!!
---
Lmfao he said he felt like a twat but he ripped on it pretty hard. Talking about how it looks hand painted by someone who doesn‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing and he said he could do a better job lol. I don‚Äôt give two shits man I‚Äôm just happy.
---
Edit: it also came with a dead orbit banner
---
That's insane
---
#*YES UNTENSIFIES*
---
I don't know if anyone has found this already and I'm just late, but i didn't find any scanables it's really just a random empty room.
---
I finally got the fuckin ikelos shotgun my third try. I missed it last time around and had to wait forever
---
Same dude. I played D1 since day one, I loved the game so much up until Rise of Iron, but after that I started playing less and less. Then I saw a couple reviews on Destiny 2 when it came put and decided not to get it. After that when it became free on BNet I was like ‚ÄúWhy not give it a try‚Äù Now I‚Äôm 650 on all characters 
---
What an ass it looks great definitely worth it man!
---
Thanks for help everyone! Glad the community is so helpful!
---
Ya..
---
i just need armor exotics, and all i want are gwisen, one eye, and protocol.
---
Phoenix Protocol is overrated.  I never use it unless in Blind Well.
---
It was too late anyways lol
---
Do you raid at all? It's a fantastic weapon in the Crucible too
---
All right all right all right... sex on the field!!
---
Wait I know you! You're a wanted man!
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/aqobtk/not_this_year_i_got_you_yerot/
---
I am on PC and i use a keyboard.
---
So it at least has something in common with Destiny, i guess.
---
I have an annual pass, but I'm not sure if it is required.
---
The first step for the quest (from the drifter) did pop up once it was available, though.
---
Too bad switching gear on console takes ages which can be really bad during activities like raid encounters etc. Also won't work in areas where your equipment is locked e.g. nightfalls.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Other than that cool and fun to use build.
---
Spread the Awareness!! 
---
I keep trying to do the hand cannon/shotgun meta, but it just never works out how it seems like it should.  My aim is way too bad for hand cannons to work for me, and I always feel like I'm missing something fundamental about shotguns, because neither the whole instant reaction shot that gets people coming around corners nor the slideshot thing where it feels like they can gib you from 100 meters away ever works when I try to do them.
---
On the other hand, my K/D always goes way up every time I re-equip my favorite auto rifles, but then I always feel like I'm being a lame noob.
---
Now I just need to find a Last Word so my friend can get it. He feels like Shin Malphur. His name is Sean so we call him Sean Malphur. He uses Last Word, Lucky Pants, Golden Gun, and got Wayfarer just to be Shin. And made his real name Shin Malphur on Playstation..
---
I hate the tracking on the XXLarge nova, sometimes it just likes to float anywhere but what   u wanted it to go 
---
I'd actually go there if we were allowed outside of quests and adventures. Seems lazy to not let us go into the area that was advertised quite a bit.
---
Chalice dungeon-like system would be cool. I'd be onboard for anything better than what we have.
---
1000 degree red hot knife vs guardians, results may shock you
---
Real question is why do you have 73 and not 3k+
---
Stability works unlike you‚Äôd think. Values of 5 (15, 25, 35, etc.) have more side-to-side recoil, whereas 10‚Äôs (10, 20, 30, etc.) has vertical. If it‚Äôs already vertical, recoil mod adds 15, so it reverses the recoil direction.
---
OKKKK!
---
NEVER!!
---
Thx
---
Kill clip/feeding frenzy seems crizpy
---
Attack *of Titan
---
Same thing happened to me that's why I stuck it out, just to try and complete it and stop it dropping. Seeing the prestige requirement during year 1 wasn't something I was too happy about. 
---
I'm gonna complete all the adventures on the last account that hasn't already done them and spend about an hour killing cabal and see what happens.
---
It's Reddit compression takes a while to render in hd
---
If you don't care for it, then you don't have to use it. I've made the mistake of making myself like weapons, and it usually just means I'll come to despise them. For me that was Thorn. I love the gun, but I just couldn't ever use it much, personally, cause I just didn't feel right using it over guns like Hawkmoon.  
---
I personally love the Breakneck and have been using it as my primary autorifle for some time now, but if it ain't your thing then don't sweat it. Bygones is another good rifle, and if you've got a good roll and have grown comfortable with it, then roll with it!
---
Bygones is the best non-exotic gun I've got so far the range is ridiculous! 
---
I would say support oughta be higher. It produces a bananas amount of orbs
---
Looks about right to me. 
---
Awesome, bravo.
---
o7
---
Chaos reach warlock ? 
---
&gt; good way to commemorate completing a raid 
---
Definitely!
---
My clan-mates and I always have to faff around to try and get a decent screenshot of our Raid team whenever we complete a Raid :-/
---
That‚Äôs what we have at the moment but just imagine the possibilities with some kind of theatre mode with free cam.
---
A man can dream 
---
Super powerful in pvp
---
so,I too,am doing my part..... I was getting a bit mad a a gaurdian,then I decided .... to inform that every strike can become heroic. each one is different . Google making pub events heroic. there is an actual list ,to help. you.
---
   then,I said I did not know either!... 
---
maybe it will help spread the word,but.... luke me ,I'm sure the person doesn't even know how to receive the message.
---
wow,this really strikes a chord ..
---
Nice work!
---
I got the vow and he doesnt
---
Opportunity is now a first War-mind. It's not a last time we will heard about it. 
---
üòâüòÇ
---
What's your point? You expect to always win? Maybe you don't understand how this works.
---
I don‚Äôt think the Odynoms are significant to any lore. Triumphs are probably their only purpose. 
---
I think amazon does sell it, but it goes outta stock cause it‚Äôs so popular
---
Catalyst brings the mag up to 7, too!
---
I keep trying to spin the guns like you can spin the player model; I would love it!
---
Well I wouldn't know but makes sense. 3rd world problems :D
---
I tried yesterday. I normally don't play Crucible but I had four quests that required it. One match in reminded me why I don't play Crucible, three matches in I just decided those quests are never getting done.
---
I started making these yesterday, I made Warlock, Titan - definitely can do Hunter next :-)
---
Happy to hook you up without having to pay, if you want. I‚Äôm on PS4 if that matters. 
---
Awesome guide man, you go on for a Hunter guide? :)
---
Same thing happened to me got to 2006 and was on a 5 streak, got all fired up and ended up losing the next 3 matches. Now I know patience will reward me.
---
Hmm I'm not sure I agree with the weapon choices here. If possible, you want to run Cerberus, suros, or Huckleberry, (or any auto rifle/submachine gun legenday) as that synergises directly with getting close and punching to get your health back. Heavy can be whatever you want, and a sniper or fusion rifle for a secondary works well to give yourself range. 
---
Pulse rifles dont offer enough flexibility at close range and handconnons will outright kill rather than weaken and activate your melee for health. 
---
I believe I have all items needed for the basic build.  Going to try it tonight.  Must punch things
---
Thanks a lot Felix, appreciate it! Hunter guide coming soon - stay tuned &lt;3
---
To clarify: I haven‚Äôt tried to buy any order over $5000. If you put the Bungie rewards stuff in your basket it tells you üòÇ
---
Not sure what you mean, but I'm just saying and it's a known fact, hunters are the saltiest!
---
Titan always needs to punch, if not, it‚Äôs not Titan! Have fun Sacalit :-)
---
So if it shows 5 different pings does that mean my ping is varying every moment??
---
You don‚Äôt get a single bit of platinum playing the game, the only way is to trade for platinum somebody else bought, also destiny has two raids skippy, warframe has literally none, there‚Äôs literally no reason to get stronger because there‚Äôs actually no endgame in it (endgame you don‚Äôt like doesn‚Äôt mean there‚Äôs no endgame)
---
Why am I not surprised you play Fortnite...
---
Nah bro it's badlander right? Same model.
---
Totally intentional right? ;)
---
Yeah that‚Äôd be awesome, just shoot me a message. Thanks so much
---
Someone just activated my catalyst
---
Me when I catch all the blades in my shield and give them back 
---
I personally really like Pulse Rifles since they are very powerfull in almost every situation; don‚Äôt have that high recoil and are masters in Range! However, it‚Äôs just personal recommendation - use what suits you the best, always feel free to tune the builds to your liking.
---
Thanks for the feedback Spidude &lt;3
---
What's with all the Hunter Hate on here?!
---
wow, those are some rookie numbers...
---
It's almost as if vendors should behave like vendors. Imagine going to the supermarket and handing over ¬£10 to be served with a random bag full of roughly \~¬£10 worth of food. This is how the vendor system currently works. Absolutely no sense.
---
Yeah skip grenades are rough, glad I'm one win away because this weekend things might get sweaty
---
How could they dig that deep?
---
I don't get it...
---
You can parry rockets wtf is that! Brb gotta make a hunter.
---
Which one would you like?
---
Damn I have the firefly / rampage, but do I need this firefly / killclip in my life?
---
Last Word anything lol Whichever one you want to give away. thank you so much!
---
Dude. Idk why, but your characters oddly fits their title and fashion. It's so satisfying!
---
As for the hunter, I think the Chronicler, Dredgen or Wayfearer (being this last one the one i think fits the most) are suitable for the hunter. Why wayfearer? Because the Hunter has been there, everywhere. Every place it's possible to be in, the hunter has been there.
---
RIP that womans profile
---
Then, stay reunited and throw more grenades. Simple fix.
---
Was the first vex
---
i'm like 150 LL and that's a Forge Saboteur.
---
*laughs in pvp try hard*
---
Wimpy hunter mains 
---
Alexa, play the Doctor Who Theme
---
What if we discovered a monumental tomb from the golden age for it?  Like ancient Egyptian pharaohs.
---
It wouldn't allow me to post any pictures or links, only text 
---
Yeah, I use a shotgun, fuck you. What else am I supposed to do when my other gun is a scout rifle? Everyone always wants to close the gap and get close to me so I use dust rock to convince them to stay away.
---
How are you complaining about shotguns when hand cannons are so OP?
---
Oh sheet yeah they did, imma go find that one too 
---
I think that was Curiosity which landed in 2011.
---
Do the eroic adventure in the tangled shore till you get it :)
---
If it was then that might explain why we don't get them anymore  
---
In this case, literally the same coat of paint.
---
You got outplayed lol!
---
&gt; then behind you
---
nothing personnel, kid
---
I started the questline right at the beginning of the season   I finished the handcannon headshots part 2 days ago... Hit fabled early in the AM today 
---
Thats a shame. 
---
Can we get a TARDIS ship?  Ghosts are basically sentient sonic screwdrivers.
---
If you really play crucible so much you should know how to deal with shotguns...
---
The whole point of using a shotgun is to be extremely effective at close range... If someone keeps killing you with a shotgun maybe back up next time...
---
You can read news like this in the "This Week at Bungie" posts. [Here's the latest one](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/47630)
---
I think we know how it went.
---
Grats.
---
I solo'd mine from 1500-2100.
---
FUCK THIS GUN.
---
FUCK THIS QUEST.
---
FUCK NOT FORGOTTEN.
---
I'm okay not getting it.
---
also fuck competitive.
---
Try blast furnace for pve. I feel like it‚Äôs more consistent. 
---
I prefer bygones for pvp. 
---
He's talking about Neckbreaker and Gambit and this post is about Crucible, lol.
---
Had a few of them last night.  You get their health super low then they teleport somewhere they weren't (usually behind you) with way more health than had.  It's like they travel back in time before you shot them.
---
*^(omae wa mou shindeiru intensifies)*
---
Hahahaha I'm the same.. I ended up helping another guy I stacked with at the end to get his..  I'm at around 2500 now but I'm done.... I can only imagine how sweaty Comp is gonna be for me now if I ever wanted to try for NF 
---
Its from the fast and the furious. Actors name was Paul Walker. He died and this scene was a tribute to him in the 7th movie
---
[this is how your post reads](https://vocaroo.com/i/s0uWHgzFsLwZ)
---
Antaeus Wards seem to make this less of an issue.  
---
Inb4 even more titan OP
---
I really want a build that is centered around ACD/0 Feedback fence.
---
Like lucio but more op 
---
You make a good point
---
Well shit. It happens to me a lot fortunately. Take longer, more frequent breaks? Lol 
---
I don‚Äôt get it. Is there supposed to be something at the end 
---
im gonna try it , thx for advice 
---
Yeah I‚Äôm trying to get fabled rn. With a group or without I just can‚Äôt make any progress toward fabled 
---
A come back that hasn‚Äôt ever failed me is just ‚ÄúOk neckbeard‚Äù they never message you ever again if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre going for. 
---
Luckiest? maybe... at least you will have the chance to experiment the OEM pre-nerf for a couple of weeks ;-)
---
All good, feel free to ask me anytime :-)
---
I could be wrong.  But at the least I seem to not die to shotguns nearly as much.  Maybe it's not reflecting it, just blocking it
---
Uh, this is an original recording buddy. I don‚Äôt spend a lot of time on this sub, I just post things I find funny in Destiny here.
---
I see it brought up often, and it happens to my two character I never touch, even for milestones. Just have a lot more fun on my hunter. 
---
Obviously it‚Äôs anecdotal, but hell... whatever works
---
It's kinda trippy just to zone out while it's falling 
---
Every titan ever. 
---
Or in my case being 1/2 away from a 20 kill streak and dying just as I'm close to getting it.
---
Sorry, your submission has been automatically removed.

It appears you are asking a question about Destiny 2 error codes or a bug.

Good call, over all doubles has been pretty fun for me.
---
Nah, this is intentional
---
I'm no developer, but how hard is it to add an elimination mode? At least to test the water? If not successful just remove it after.  A whole new loot pool is a different thing, but they could experiment with game modes to keep things fresh a little in the mean time.
---
Also, nerf the amount of rounds in countdown please?!
---
Yeah, I guess this is it.  That just never made sense to me.  I have always been one to ignore rewards if the content isn't intrinsically fun.  I mean, either way we are talking about 1s and 0s, not real world rewards.
---
That's how I felt when I got ghost in the night
---
Not sure what that is, I only recently hit 600 power though and have yet to get into any of the Black Armory stuff.
---
Will you solo this as well? 
---
Yes! And I Love It! 
---
Congrats, but you could have saved quite some time by just teaming up. Getting a Luna by just random matchmaking luck is too much of a time investment. 
---
when will it be hard light :(
---
Destiny 2 blows 
---
I understand, I haven‚Äôt even bothered to ask my clan for help. Got mine together with a buddy I play pvp stuff with since D1, the other two were random people I met on Discord servers. 
---
Right now I‚Äôm trying to find someone within my k/d range from my clan to play CD with... nothing. I don‚Äôt want to fight an uphill battle each match, but I guess I‚Äòm just lucky I didn‚Äôt get called out for being elitist yet (I‚Äôm not that amazing btw). 
---
Iron banner is back next tues,btw
---
Sorry to get your hopes up like that but no he doesn't ;-;
---
No one thinks it‚Äôs only void on voice lol. And you can‚Äôt argue one grenade is easier to use than a super, it‚Äôs not. 
---
To answer your question in detail OP. "dailies" reset every 4 days, It's between strikes, gambit, crucible, and heroic missions. And every day they reset one of those. 
---
[There, have a random reddit post explaining it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/9dt42z/daily_challenges_reset_calendar_and_info/)
---
First the Tower...and now Oppy? They've gone too far.
---
I forget the full name but the ursa-something gauntlets should be fun to use 
---
I need shards on my hunter and phoenix protocal on my Warlock.  
---
You could have had less trouble if you had put some effort in to find a team. Would have saved you some time and sanity in the end. 
---
jebaited?
---
\*vengeance denied\*
---
I really like the armor of crucible, it's one of the few that has a base regeneration stat on it instead of the resilience stat that is always on vigil of heroes stuff. The powerful gear is also super nice.
---
But crucible is such a hair-pulling frustrating experience that I just can't do it for that sweet loot. *Sigh*
---
The best gun in the game 
---
Buff OEM lol
---
The problem is that, I want this armor set, but I also want good rolls, making it nearly impossible to get.
---
I literally just got shards like a week ago.  I was getting salty cause I main a Hunter and thought they were never gonna drop.  But sure enough right after they get "nerfed" I get them..  go figure.
---
That also seems nice! Likely gets erratic recoil out of the equation! Nice roll, Guardian!
---
Dropped to like 7 after because I was basically afk, spamming screenshots to everyone I knew on discord
---
Thank you for your inept opinion. üôÑ
---
That feeding frenzy/kill clip roll was my first BF! So funny that we had similar luck on opposite items! Best of luck on future rolls.
---
Did it 100% solo. The voices thought it was a great idea
---
Just so you all know these rovers are like, pretty large, like, maybe the size of a small car. Which always surprises me cause I imagine someone bending down and petting it but it‚Äôs taller than a lot of people. 
---
Please tell me you love it as much as I do. It's just pretty to look at, honestly.
---
I think you have crucible bounties on consoles too

Feel like this is a surefire way to get creepmail/ horrible RP Sexts

It‚Äôs just common knowledge on the internet to know what you‚Äôre talking about before commenting controversial and or insulting comments on a platform. If you are going to be rude to someone at least pay attention and make sure you know everything about what you‚Äôre insulting their video for before saying it. And i quote ‚Äúnothing to see here‚Äù I‚Äôm already having a bad day so I‚Äôm not gonna chase this any longer feel free to reply but don‚Äôt expect a response. Have a blessed day sweet heart

Me currently with the Last Word 
---
Nice moves 
---
have you tried pulling the right trigger while having both equipped?
---
What about ZaVaLA?!
---
Lmao good. I need entertainment 
---
I don't miss that

Parcel of Stardust

Age-Old Bond

Play of the Game/Hammerheqd
---
I understand, that's not what I'm looking for though
---
hold up kuz i never insulted you or your video if youre so sensitive that noone can comment or disagree with you which i didnt id sughest not posting shit to a public forum where any and everyone has an opinion that can be made known you sir are a joke and im sorry i wasted my enerfy on you if you call what i typed negatively impactful all i can say is grow a pair i never disagreed with your original point only made a side point and you cant handle it gtfoh 
---
Are any of these core game exotics? 
---
Rule 13 - - No LFG posts and no clan recruitments. 
---
how the fuck am i supposed to know youre having a bad day again grow a pair
---
So did this guy delete his post or get hammered by the admins? Lol
---
F
---
More like: when you have to play crucible in general
---
Elastic string with moving target and rampage. The 600 draw time with rampage is pretty nice
---
This is a banger, awesome! Very slick compositing (just a guess), or even original. Would die to have some inside on the steps that went into this. 
---
If that's 5 weeks of grinding on 3 characters (that would be 30 attempts), then your RNG just sucks. 5 weeks on 1 character (10 attempts) would seem to be within reason.
---
Nope! Console. Thanks for the offer, though; that's generous. 
---
Razor Deathstalker ftw.
---
I recently smashed one, and bought a new one. The price doubled in the last 3 years.
---
Thanks man. I'm up to 60 runs for it and I'm starting to believe the god roll is not dropping lol
---
All hail Th3Jez
---
Assuming it's the same as I'm thinking, it was patches a couple of weeks ago. 
---

Took me hours to do it in the main account... so annoying do all the Forges again... i think i will do only volundr maybe just to farm the armor... bad news:/
---
Embrace the darkness.

This is more of a fun to play build than just pure meta, however I don't agree that you're calling bottom tree w/ IS a waste, since it's reloading your weapons 24/7 and you have also a HP regen. For sure, there are better build options than this, but still I do recommend this because it's a great fun to just fly around dodging for 3 minutes straight.  
---
I love your recommendation though, that seems to be pretty fun as well!  
---
Also, the PotG is just another :can replace with everything: gun, that is fairly easy to get.
---
Aw :(
---
It also has a blind effect.  I think if the blind got buffed and the ridiculous headshot hitbox got nerfed, it would still be useful in PvP/Gambit without being considered "Broken".  Like, I get that it should be good for *something,* but if that something feels like a bug, then its probably not a good design.
---
...which I think is what some people (myself included) mean when they call it broken its not "OP" broken, but "bugged" broken, at least that's what the weird headshot stuff feels like.
---
I have a screenshot from my RDR2 playthrough of my horse taking a shit while I was trying to take a picture of it‚Äôs balls so whenever someone is toxic I just send them that screenshot
---
Holy shit, this is incredible.
---
Redrix doesn't even take effort to get. Especially now that the resets count across all seasons, it's just something that's in the background that you eventually get from playing for a while. 
---
I'd argue that it's less the 'challenge' portion and more the 'time' portion that people are annoyed over more, at least for stuff like Luna's, NF, Redrix etc. In regards to your point about 'The new shiny is waiting for you when you get back on,' there's systems in place for some of these quests that simply make that untrue. For instance, someone who works enough, even if they do have the skill to get Luna's, might have too much time eaten and have their entire glory wiped with the new season, or literally cannot fit in time for 5 whole valor resets, or can't even make it in for the week to get Izanagi's Shattered Throne requirement. That's not a 'test of skill' or even something that, if changed, would lessen the skill needed, it's literally a function of time. For instance, I would like to go for Luna's right now, but I've barely started competitive, but I have no drive to do it if I know any progress towards the ranking section is going to be wiped soon. I'd argue that if any systems allow for situations like that, or situations that punish those for just having a busy life even if they're 'skillful' in a game, is poor game design and should be changed to rectify those problems.
---
The only thing I'm disappointed about is there was nothing new to get really. That is if you did not want to spend money that is. I already had all the Crimson day stuff the only things I did not have was the Vow and the tiny bow and the skin for the bow witch you have to pay for. I'm not saying that I did not spend money just was hoping for more.
---
It will probably be a great gun if i can get the last quest to stop locking me out bungo at its finest. No join allies since their arent any wall goes up infront of the 3 witches. No offence but they still cant even get their drops fixed. Nightfall weapons only drop 1/2 the time, i think 80 clears for the rocket launch would get atleast 1. 1k voice last wish 22 clears, stacked keys 5 times as well, opened every chest and still nothing. Time to fix bungo
---
You guys were losing, dont think people DDOS other people when they are winning.  It doesn't really work that way. 
---
Did the community, or did the very loud and sweaty stacks that wanted a good stomping ground? Because I seriously think it was the latter.
---
Sick reference bro
---
More people need to see this. I'm tired of people suggesting "we should be able to get TLW or Lunas from doing Nightfalls." No you shouldn't. There should be rewards in the game that are activity-specific. Getting 1k voices from doing crucible would be dumb. Getting TLW from doing nightfalls would be equally dumb. 
---
Sleeper isn't a perfect LFR though.  In my opinion, its at least \*somewhat\* balanced.  The charge time is just long enough that using it has a learning curve ...and a skilled sniper can drop you in that window.  ...QB though, just doesn't feel like a correct implementation of a concept.  ...like, bugged to hell incorrect.
---
I got pretty lucky early on with a FF/KC, Steady Rounds, Rasmussen ISA, but MW is reload. Still a beast. 
---
I finally, after already completing my Master Smith triumph, got a FF/Rampage roll with Steady Rounds, &amp; Meyrin RDS, but with a reload MW. I don‚Äôt even care about the MW being somewhat wasted, I was finally happy I got a FF/rampage roll since I main PvE. 
---
Your god roll exists man just keep grinding! Although, a FF/KC roll is still great in PvE too! 
---
Using the word autistic as an insult is kinda shitty fyi
---
That happened with me too
---
#*SCREAMS IN 1,000 VOICES*
---
Wait, $15 per pin? I want that colony one but that's 5x the price they should be.
---
What do you play on?
---
Yeah. Crucible is straight trash. Legitimately am confused as to how people can enjoy it.
---
Have you tried stacking paragon mods,perpetuation and putting titan barricades in every doorway? ... fun!
