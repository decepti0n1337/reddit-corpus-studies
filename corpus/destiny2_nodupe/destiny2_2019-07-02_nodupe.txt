But foresaken and the annual pass. On ps4 it‚Äôs a bundle with Osiris and warmind but don‚Äôt worry because foresaken is 40 usd and the bundle is 40 usd so it doesn‚Äôt matter m. Buy the bundle and you‚Äôll be caught up
---
I like this. I'm time-poor for vidjamagames, so it's probably going to be a long time before I hit the content wall. If I hit it early, I'll upgrade. If I don't, steam could have a sale on Forsaken by the time I do, so may as well hold off. \^\_\^

&amp;#x200B;

I'll adopt that stance for now. Will wait and see on whether or not I get impatient enough for the other subclasses to break ranks on this decision before then. :P  
---
Thanks!
---
What recording program do you use by chance? I really should get one with the crazy shit that happens to me.
---
Ah is it, only started playing a week and a bit ago as I‚Äôve not had my console with me, stopped just after expansion one so, apologies I was unaware
---
It's been there for as long as I can remember it's a moving against the enemy.

Even Taniks has common sense, come on people

Also, anyone know if the missions towards the menagerie are independent to other characters? 
---
If I were to complete my first ever menagerie on 1 character, would I still have my first menagerie mission on my second character?

Same thing happened to me rip

Goodbye

LMFAO taunting the vex is possibly the best moment in a destiny clip I‚Äôve seen in a very long time !
---
Didn‚Äôt think it was cause there was no message in the chat bitty on updates in the area you know
---
Dudes just an asshat, don‚Äôt mind him
---
I trained her well lmao
---
Nor can I, thorn 3 taps. It does need a range buff for sure though.
---
PUNCH.

I hope soviet sees this.

IM ACTUALLY TIRED OF THIS THREAD YOU KEEP MENTIONING INABILITY TO USE A GRENADE LAUNCHER THATS WHAT IM COMPLAINING ABOUT IM COMPLAINING ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT USE THE THIS LOCKDOWN CHEEESE BECAUSE THEY CAN'T USE A GRENADE LAUNCHER. IM SHIT WITH GRENADE LAUNCHERS WHICH IS WHY IM DOING IT LEGIT TO TRY AND BTTER MYSELF NOT ONLY IN CRUCIBLE WHICH I;'LL ADMIT IM NOT THE BEST AT AND I CAN SAFELY SAY YOU PROBABLY ARENT THE BEST EITHER BUT IT ANGERS ME WHEN PEOPLE GO INTO THESE LOBBIES AND JUST SIT THERE GETTING EASY KILLS ON EACH OTHER. I DIDN'T START THE THREAD HOPING TO TALK ABOUT THE BEST LOUDOUT I STARTED IT IN HOPES TO HEAR EVERYONES OPINION ON PEOPLE DOING THIS CHEESE. ALSO MY PLAYSTYLE IS NOT BAD IT SIMPLY DOESN'T INVOLVE ANY WEAPONS YOU MIGHT USE, I DONT USE SHOTGUNS OR GL'S IN MY CASUAL LOADOUT MY CASUAL LOADOUT IS A SNIPER/RECLUSE AND A HANDCANNON AND A GOOD HEAVY WHICH I COULDN'T CARE ABOUT. AND IT WORKS AND THE PROOF OF THAT IS I RAISED MY KDA FROM 1.44 TO 1.51 IN THE LAST MONTH OR SO. AND NO RUNNNING 3 GL'S IS NOT THE ONLY WAY TO COMPLETE THE QUEST EVEN THOUGH YOU MAY SEE IT THAT WAY.
---
Good Job!
---
My thorn 8 taps, I was in iron banner the other week and it didn‚Äôt do any damage, it‚Äôs surprising how little bungie cares about the balancing of hand cannons

If you watch the bottom left of your screen near the end of the clip it says "The enemy weekens and retreats"  If it is not actually called an enemy moves against each other it is something very similar.
---
Considering they're fixing the chest glitch for the menag. I don't see it as even remotely viable. A guy on YouTube said if took him 40 drops for the gun he wanted with the perks. Im not spending half an hour for one drop.
---
That was an amazing shot

Common sense? Why have that when you can have SIVA? 
---
~consume enhance replicate-
---
Versus you could spend hours trying to get a very specific drop to meet the light level but every other powerful you get is something that you already have/don't need
---
It happens when the fallen &amp; vex fight each other in that area, you don't get much loot from it though.

Oh gotcha lol. Thanks for the explanation, I was looking on the insta

You are most certainly going to need a team. To my knowledge there is not a single person that has solod to legend legitly. There was one guy how did but he was matchmaking at the same time as his friends so he would have his team with him, he would just queue by himself.
---
Grenade launchers are the bees knees for boss damage now.
---
That's awesome bro

By the way you don‚Äôt need a spike grenade launcher. Anyone without blinding grandes will work just fine when doing boss damage

---
If you're trying to kill solely with Fighting Lion you're doing it wrong. Fighting Lion is designed to weaken a target then clean them up with a primary. Most people don't get this play style but better players can see why it's good. 
---
Bounce a grenade around a corner, weaken an enemy, finish them off with a primary, spent grenade is refunded on successful clean up kill. That's how it's supposed to be used.
---
This play style allows you to play on your terms. You can bait the enemy in or be aggressive and "stun" them with a grenade and clean up before they realise what's hit them.
---
That's because it's not in the game.
---
The lumina quest isnt out yet... it comes out tomorrow at reset
---
Making titans who complain about being underwhelming in PvE to shame with this, I love it!(not in a mean way tho I just thought of Shaxx saying it and thought it was funny and that I should share I love all classes don‚Äôt kill me please)
---
Damnit dad bot I'm tired of you interrupting discussions
---
Wasted.
---
Pretty sure you can find them from just doing stuff around Mars, namely EP.
---
It wasn't bad either. It just wasn't worth to play it for a longer time. I enjoyed it for sure. It was simple.
---
Not til reset smh
---
They're covering some shit up.
---
Yes
---
Oh....my bad then
---
So what?? Here's why it's a big deal. On PC (which you obviously play on) you can keep up with them and their mobility. It's very different on console. Having low sensitivity, as most players do, it is physically Impossible to keep up with a hunter when they jump over your head, and dodge. Yes Titans do have one hit capabilities but so do warlocks. The only reason Titans are decent on console is because of OEM and busted slam. Soon busted slam is going to be nerfed to the ground and they'll have nothing.
---
Gg dude
---
That's just what they want you to think. Why do you think we haven't been back there in so long?
---
https://youtu.be/_DaUsCyt-8k
---
They forgot the part where there covering up transformers.
---
Once you finished the story and experienced all the events/strikes a few times there was little to no reason to grind anything. For a "FPS MMO" it was severely lacking in the mmo department.
---
You'll have to buy the game but you should be able to transfer your account come September
---
They‚Äôre only bad if you‚Äôre garbage at the game. #Titanmasterrace
---
But to answer your question, Yes Titans are viable. That‚Äôs not even a question.

---
Nice., but whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold.
---
I'm saying though... How do they REALLY know?

not to be an idiot but where is Xur?

why these boys out here lyin?

Should be possible, although you may have to troubleshoot some NAT wonkiness, which can be a pain.

I love watching destiny channels that used to have videos shitting on it, and then seeing their new videos kissing ass as if nothing happened.
---
That stinks /:
---
Thanks tho, appreciate it (:
---
Oh Yea? Prove it.
---
"That Wizard Came From the Moon" 
---
Of course NASA would lie abt it
---
Fairly sure they can't prove this.  \_If\_ ghosts exist, then they can just hide.

Is this ok?

They always do.

And then they die. F.

Only just noticed the top of the OEM looks like up votes.

Yes, but if you want to play other content than D2Y1 on your PC, you will have to buy that content again on PC.

Unless I hear it straight from the mouth of Zak Bagans I‚Äôm not convinced

Nah their masks just fall off, don‚Äôt worry.

There‚Äôs wizards and we haven‚Äôt found the traveler yet

I don't know enough to answer you yet!
---
Does he have forsaken?
---
and also i got "taken anomaly" mission and idk how i got it
---
And also what hc would you compare it to?
---
Maybe they are hiding the real hive to ensure we never try to go and kill another hive god
---
Is it guaranteed from the engram? Coz I have a friend that got it first try and a friend that didn‚Äôt
---
Not guaranteed high chance though
---
Does he already have whisper on that character?
---
Still looks like it's haunted
---
Are you melting him as soon as you can damage him?
---
NEVER, believe A WORD nasa says!!
---
It gives you a weapon/ armor you don't already have. If you have every other exotic armor and weapon on that character, excluding the ones from annual pass then it will give you LoW.
---
Yea
---
I managed to beat him by just fighting him normally but I wanted to report the bug
---
Lies and conspiracy. That shit is haunted as fuck
---
Soo close to losing your soul
---
As a titan i literally felt some kind of hostility towards warlocks i insitcievly keep trying to. Be better than them and somehow i never liked them since d1.

u/destiny_thememe
---
It will come back when they are ready to bring it back. There is no place for it right now in the ecosystem. They have already said they are focusing on pvp in shadowkeep so be patient
---
Lmao
---
I‚Äôm saying it makes the loadout more effective.  Warlocks are almost always forced to use a subclass and exotic that focuses on team play and does very little to help the player as they deal with end game enemies in said actvity.  Having a sword that can allow you to spam your rift without depending on teammates staying in it/running through it let‚Äôs you use it offensively.   With certain weapons, you can really abuse the luna rift spam, such as mountain top, loaded question, recluse, etc.  
---
So yes, you will still almost always be forced into lunafaction boots and well of radiance, but with the sword, you can craft a play style that takes advantage of it.
---
I wish this was real so bad.
---
Pve is different for everything especially when raiding different encounters require different loadouts
---
Best at being a rift
---
Is there a leveling system, either player or weapon?
---
Goldie main here :)
---
Sometimes.
---
Why, so you can deal with the same sweats and even more account recoveries? Good luck
---
Nah. Im. Just another striker with shotgun and sword. But in case shit happens i always keep in somewhat safe distance to revive them. If i have above 170 im happy. I've done my job. Even if i feel need to compete im team member at first place so i can't just mindlessly run and kill everything.
---
I'm still waiting for my Destiny apartment.
---
I know they are now, I‚Äôm just saying when they get balanced I hope they still remain a good option for crucible and don‚Äôt get nerfed into the ground.
---
Ok im using the void exotic from base game so i should stick to lving up sin?
---
You have levels until level 50 and light level. Your light level goes on after 50 up to 750 with all dlcs. Weapons themselves (gear in general) can't level but get higher light level either by infusing or just equipping a higher item.
---
This is exactly what I would say if I knew it was haunted.
---
Last question... Aside from the cost to purchase the game itself. Is there like a monthly subscription cost to play?
---
aeons are totally worthless since they buff your team but not yourself. nezarec is amazing on any of the subclasses if you're using a void primary or telesto.
---
I meant the guy who posted this. I'm trying to think of other things he'd do, maybe use chaperone then when he gets killed by a badlander at really close range he'd say shotguns have too much range
---
How would they know though they haven‚Äôt been there since 1972?
---

Sounds good. Will get you invites when Bungie.net is up and discord isn't grumpy

How do you know? You've never been there. /s

Ok ty are there any other exotic armor i should keep an eye out for or just stick with Naz and void burst exotic from base game?

@u/destiny_thememe made this

did rise of iron never happen or what‚Äôs up

Knowing you have a receptive audience is always nice. Some of the less game focused more financial driven aspects he writes about I really enjoy.

This is not a rumour. It is going to be a new feature in September.

Go to bungie.net and watch the vidoc for shadowkeep. Crossave is coming but not here yet

Sounds like a plan, there are too many rocks on the moon
---
Fuck this spam
---
Why would i want to heal those morons
---
Its a 900 rpm adaptive frame. The difference between crit shots and non crits is minimal, same as recluse. Its raw damage output even with the ride the bull perk active and reload times is far better, especially when it comes to dealing with fast moving trash ads, which is all either weapon should be used for. OPs entire post revolves around the CoS raid where theres not nearly enough ads to justify using a huckleberry for the reasons you specified. In select situations, with near infinite trash ads running at you and 0 time to reload, it would probably outperform a trackless(very easily farmable with menagerie) but as for OPs needs. Trackless all the way if he's set on using a top tier smg.
---
#*loud punching*

Me to. The few he's been writing about the financials of Bungie/Destiny 2 post Activision have been really interesting to me.

Uh, you've got an hour and 36 minutes until reset.

Really dang ok thank you

what are good shotgun perks to keep an eye out for?

@u/destiny_thememe

It's a Goddamn cover up now we gotta go..."cocks gun, moons haunted"

I'll have to try it myself as you do raise some good points

They don‚Äôt know that

I love it. My son is on og xbox compare to me And i very every where a about 20 sec ahead of him. Plus loading my menu is so much better. Not as good as PC, but I'm so glad i have one
---
No idea why on earth you think they would remove the chalice from the game. As others have said they have never removed content like that from Destiny ever so its odd that you thought they would.
---
Way more than 20-30%.
---
I can go from Xbox dashboard to orbit in under a minute.
---
The way of the lion takes practice. Lion is all about doing chip damage down lanes, around corners, everything. I would say, go for your Sniper headshot. If you miss entirely, shoot a lion and change angles. If you hit the body, switch to the lion and bounce the shot around a corner. 
---
If you're being aggressed by a shotgun, get around a corner and spam the lion. Get airborne and start raining down hell.
---
u/destiny_thememe ‚Äòs post
---
That is going to depend all on your playstyle if you aren't going to go for the usuals. I don't use shotguns often in PvP anymore, not unless I have to switch my tactics, but of course Rampage, sometimes slideshot, sometimes heart monitor, I would always  go for Snapshot on precision/slugs. Shotgunning all comes down to tactics vs jumping vs apeing, and each shotty needs specific perks to do those jobs.
---
If you have forsaken keep an eye out for contraverse hold and geomag stabilizers
---
[Harlem Shake edit](https://youtu.be/sa-7R7B4mhI)

No because you get both with helm of saint 14.

You're not the only one.

Nope, thats just how all previews look when you preview an item for a class you are not currently on. Nothing special. been there for months.

If you wait till September, you won‚Äôt have to pay.
---
Though to be fair, NASA wouldn't tell you if the moon was haunted anyway
---
To infinity, and beyond!
---
You know, I was going to say the other side was the 110's. Except those can actually reliably get kills.
---
I have Destiny 2, the 1st season pass and the Forsaken expansion (Not the Forsaken season pass) do I still need the Forsaken Season Pass(Annual Pass 2) or will Shadowkeep include Annual Pass 2&amp;3?
---
You saying that posting it with that links?(Fireteams,destinylfg)
---
You have to complete the Forsaken campaign and then you will get the quest.
---
It‚Äôs just a profile icon, nothing fancy
---
Could you imagine walking around on earth having a good day only to be no scoped by NASA
---
Lol I came just to write your very comment. i sense a conspiracy from the highest levels of the Space Program!
---
Not the only one, scrolling through the countless repeated content is tiresome and I wish people would utilize r/DestinyMemes more.
---
It's kinda weird. 140s are a 3 headshot kill, but explosive payload actually hits for a bit less headshot damage. On some archetypes it's enough where a 3 headshot won't kill because of EP, but since 140s actually overkill a bit with a 3 headshot it should be okay. You'd have to test it out to make sure, really though EP isn't a good crucible perk and you'd want something like:  [https://banshee-44.com/?weapon=153979397&amp;socketEntries=1294026524,1926090091,3142289711,2846385770,47981717,4248210736,2323986101,2697220197,0,2285418970](https://banshee-44.com/?weapon=153979397&amp;socketEntries=1294026524,1926090091,3142289711,2846385770,47981717,4248210736,2323986101,2697220197,0,2285418970)

however if you have access to the Menagerie the Austringer is essentially the same gun with better base stats and better possible rolls.

Warlock with the new helmet and blink can do wonders to cut the timer down

And if you have a ssd, better for opening the chalice too
---
Did you just have a stroke? I don't understand this sentence.
---
...really?
---
Since you're on pc it can be good, but range perks are preffered. This is because the only thing that'll keep you from being destroyed by a 150 would be distance. 
---
Having more range means you'll have a better time keeping your distance and three tapping while 150s need to keep closing the gap. 
---
I've only really played pc for a while, but it is well known that this is the only advantage 140s have over 150s due to 150s faster ttk.
---
&gt;Outliers will happen, and while it sucks it really just is your bad luck. Just run it again, hope for the best.
---
That's your opinion and not necessarily one everyone agrees with.  Most people would prefer a light at the end of the tunnel.  I don't want or need a carrot on a stick to chase, I like to choose the activity I enjoy most and play that.  I don't need psychological manipulation to drive me to play the game.  I was barely playing D2 then Anarchy finally dropped for me, and it sparked something I haven't felt in D2 for months.  FUN.  Imagine that!  Menag runs were very easy even on day one with Anarchy and it's a weapon more people should get to experience.  It's as top tier as you can possibly get when paired with Mountaintop, and only slightly loses in DPS compared to spike Swarm WITH tractor cannon buff.  As far as raw DPS one guardian alone can achieve, Anarchy is 50% of the equation.  
---
It's great you seem to have a dedicated clan to run the raids with and probably speed run them, but as a LFG solo who's had to sit through 1-3+ hour Scorge runs because people can't figure out CAP....well let's just say my 13th run where Anarchy dropped was the last run I'll ever do.  My opinion may be different if I was involved in a sweaty PvE clan dripping with competence.  
---
I think the key difference here is you seem to enjoy the raids after the 5th+ clear.  10-20 clears should be the upper limit someone has to run to get the raid exotic, and then anything beyond that can be up to them if they find it enjoyable or not.  That way we both get what we want here, you can keep running it and people like me don't have to.
---
Dude people last night just helped finish the Thorn strike so for sure, there will be people in two weeks.
---
This is still D1 yet, they're probably still good.
---
I decided to break out my old winterwolf and roll with it again. It looks amazing with the warbrick shader and good god, I forgot how great it felt to fire that thing üòÉ
---
Guess that ARES 1 mission could be on the horizon.
---
Yeah, the big thing is the actual ghost replica, the in game dlc is just an exclusive profile icon
---
Bad mod.
---
Poor warlock has to carry such a useless team
---
They need a buff so badly. I actively avoid them even in PvE.
---
Agreed. My god, it was done to death about 2 days after it started, enough already.
---
There's a reason I prefer DTG to this sub: less memes.
---
Good to know. Thanks, friend!
---
Why does the new hand cannon look so much like Malfeasance?
---
This is amazing. Sunshot is so much fun
---
People see titan not having mandatory raid exotics as a negative, but they're thinking about it wrong, titan is best class because you can wear r/DestinyFashion in all PvE activities and still be fine. I main titan not just because I like to punch, but because I look gosh damn beautiful while I do it.
---
Friendship with thorn ended, rose new best friend
---
I finished the campaign bro.
---
Moon's haunted, Vex Robots are on the rise, we just need the traveler
---
Last night, my raid group consisted of 2 Titans, 1 Hunter, and 1 Warlock.
---
This more likely for Mars
---
If they aren't buying MIDAs I will be seriously disappointed.
---
Why is it always a hand cannon?
---
I wish there were combo supers,imagine a titan YEETING another titan like a railgun shot and just annihilating a target
---
Most people who earned NF legit don't care the 3rd shot can be a bodyshot instead of a headshot.  We're not sloppy with our aim.
---
TTK is significantly slower now, matching the rest of the 150s, and a few of the 150s have much better perks than Mag Howl.  
---
If you're referring to console, then LH/NF are still meta and dominate the other 150s for one simple fact.  Console has bloom, and LH/NF are the only 150s without bloom.
---
If console didn't have bloom, LH/NF would be as obsolete as they are on PC.
---
Hell yeah
---
Update: the calus boys had it!!
---
Basically the same area though, like 10 yards from eachother.
---
You don't need Thorn I don't have it and I'm currently doing the lumina quest
---
Sometimes the toxic depths of New arise and devour the light.
---
They are fire forging the ultimate titan bath towel using a warlock for parts.

Interesting. Most talk I‚Äôve seen about it has been all about popping a wall then throwing an empowered sticky grenade. I might have to try it out then.

Yeah you can
---
Every week on Tuesday, various activities refresh or cycle. This is referred to as the "weekly reset."
---
Then a third guy comes in with The Prospector..
---
I don't understand what I just watched. This 6 second video looks completely normal and mundane. Can you explain what you are trying to show us that is special here?
---
Triumphs, collections, continuous world (dreaming city), new supers, one of the best raids, badges, dungeon (shattered throne), spider bounties, pinnacle weapons (if im not mistaken).
---
Read my comment again you buffoon thats not what I said

I don‚Äôt think Rose and Lumina are two separate guns

Wow, he must be fun at Tower parties..

Don't forget about the solar Nade gauntlets

I really don‚Äôt even know what to think about this story. I could maybe see them needing rifles for security but I can‚Äôt see them needing rifles in space unless they know something we don‚Äôt.

Other options that work just fine too: Prometheus Lense, Riskrunner, Thorn, Crimson, Huckleberry.

Oh your real tight about it uh?
---
Load up the Leviathon raid and just farm the starting area.
---
I agree that this season its a bit weird, because the point is to have Year One Engrams right, to get old stuff you couldnt get. But they also sell a lot of "new stuff" exclusive to Season of Opulence, except this time you don't get a Season of Opulence Engrams. So they are locked behind silver only, before that you had the weekly rotation + Prismatic matrix and Bright Engrams
---
It might be in the treasure chest that is constantly appearing in mercury

I tried the region hest inside the lighthouse but it didn't give it to me
---
Following. Currently looking. I‚Äôll update here if I find it
---
Yep.  They and heavy don't belong in crucible and never have.
---
if you spent any effort at all to look through the sub, you would find your answer.
---
Following. I‚Äôm looking too. No luck yet. I‚Äôll update if I find it
---
1 quest but gives 2 weapons in the progress
---
noice
---
There are tons on guides already on the dreaming city chest. It changes hourly though so apparently it may change location again.
---
Same place you've found the thorn quest. If you don't know where that is, i'm sure there's a youtube video about it.
---
Thank you I didnt notice sorry haha
---
You can start the Lumina quest from the Salt Mines in the EDZ. The quest is in a chest in the same area the Thorn quest is at, so if you are not sure where to look (it's pretty well hidden), look up a guide for how to start the Thorn quest. 
---
Both Thorn and Lumina require the annual pass.
---
also watch out, once youve done a frame, you can do it again for regular logs BUT, you can buy it multiple times. This will not give you multiple time the frame quest, so you'll just waste logs. I made the mistake the first time, I was like, , oh damn ! i can get multiple hand cannons again and farm fast. Nope, no you can't.
---
It was a joke, but thanks anyways, I'll enjoy shoulder chargin' you in crucible
---
I think it would be a nice change of pace to have a guns-only playlist. IMO, the gun play is so good that it could stand on its own.
---
Thanks.
---
Strikes give 7% with 2 roses, idk progress with 3.
---
thank you
---
Ornaments do not unlock guns. Once you have the fun then you can use the ornament.
---
How much is that in freedom currency?
---
Ornaments will be available once you actually have the weapon. You basically just unlocked a skin but not the weapon. Do the quest
---
Still have it
---
*dubstep* 
---
Titan: I must DAAAAAANCE
---
That is downright matrix.
---
I too am stuck on this :(
---
That comes next. They'll need more than semi-auto and make a ton of them. When our Ghosts come along and wake us up, there will be Khvostovs scattered everywhere for the taking.
---
Hey guys, has anyone found it in the past few minutes in the lighthouse area on Mercury? The Thorn? It just reset the area recently and it will again soon, tryna get help for it
---
I‚Äôd guess 2 bucks
---
Was not able to get it the first time but its the public event (left side of tower looking toward the vex portal - side the lost sec is on) need to make it heroic and is ontop of the upper platform, that is what i was told as 3 people where up there and no one else could get to it when launchers pointed other way.
---
it has nothing to do with the public event.
---
I've been looking for 30 solid minutes, in the lighthouse, outside the lighthouse, around the light house, I am B A F F L E D
---
According to XE, $1.92 lmao
---
I thought they exploded in direct hits and bounced on surfaces?
---
*khvostov intensifies*
---
It‚Äôs been found.

yes
---
The LFG megathread linked at the top of this subreddit can be used to find other players. 
---
If you don't have one, the next time Xur appears, be sure to buy the Five of Swords card from him. This allows you to customize nightfall difficulty. The nightfall uses the modifiers from the fireteam leader's card.
---
In my experience, guided nightfalls have been helpful, but you have to sit in queue for a while. I‚Äôd recommend making an LFG post on the Destiny 2 app or websites made specifically for the purpose of finding a group
---
I'm sorry I'm a new reddit user and I'm not familiar with all this. I'll be sure to look for this in the future!
---
She used to visit during Iron Banner after Rise of Iron. But yes, it would be cool to see her again.

I remember one of their videos, they were doing stuff like this video in the Crota abyss. It was an amazing video.
---
Surely it wouldn‚Äôt require a PE for it
---
Do you need Forsaken Annual Pass for the quest?
---
can't confirm, but upvoting for visibility
---
Well my first chest was the Dreaming City , which i couldn't find for 1 hour searching . Then it changed to mercury and after checking the whole map there was a public event on so me and a friend wanted to make it heroic event , so i saw it there . So without the event there is no way to get it.
---
Noble Rounds - Kills with this weapon leave behind Remnants. Absorbing a Remnant converts your next hipfired shot into an ally-seeking Noble Round and partially refills the magazine.
---
Blessing of The Sky - Using a Noble Round on an ally heals them and grants both you and them a weapon damage bonus for a short duration
---
\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------basically a version of thorn where you decide when you get the buff and it heals team mates. From a bit of testing it increases the dmg by 30-33% so that means you can two tap with some hand cannons in crucible.
---
Oh. The visuals are really helpful. Thanks.
---
It was basically a chain lightning ak47, double kills refilled the mag and gave increased super gain. You could gat a ful super from about 20 thralls. My all time favorite place to use it has to be the run down to Alakhul's pit. It also sounded really cool.
---
Brave Astronaut. I'd throw off my spacesuit and go do customer service or something.
---
Unequip the heavy
---
Not a bug.  The flashpoint is Tangled Shore this week. It‚Äôll stay Tangled Shore
---
Read my comment.
---
My girlfriend and I do this kind of stuff in Destiny as well. The game is why we met in the first place
---
I really like the weapon bit man do I wish it's catalyst wasn't stability when the weapon already has no recoil
---
Maybe use Ishtar or DIM to change your heavy to a legendary and see if that fixes it
---
It was meant to be Nessus tho
---
Yea, an smg that had as its exotic perk some sort of melee related thing would be cool, like kills with the smg refreshes your melee ability and melee ability kills refills the smg mag and give you some added buff.
---
A scout rifle that files little bursts of shrapnel that deal additional damage to the target and nearby enemies on hit. Give it rampage and outlaw.
---
An SMG or scout rifle or fusion rifle that deals bonus elemental damage if your grenade is full (element of the grenade), precision kills or sustained damage create mini vortex grenades of the element of your subclass
---
A scout rifle that marks enemies hit with it for teammates and yourself, I‚Äôm not sure how long the markers would last but they would be refreshed with subsequent hits. They would also slightly increase damage to that target.
---
An SMG that fires S.W.A.R.M bullets that deal low damage and follow enemies that you are aiming near at a short range. The gun would have an ungodly large magazine, a slow reload, and short range even among smgs. The weapon would have triple tap.
---
A fusion rifle that deals additional while your super is fully charged and fires more rapidly, it also generates super energy on multi kills and has the firefly perks of the oxygen sr2
---
Feel free to critique I‚Äôm just spitballing some ideas for exotics
---
I‚Äôve been compiling a montage that will be titled ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm going, I‚Äôm taking you with me‚Äù. This seems to always happen to me. Pve. Pvp. Everywhere. Lol. And they‚Äôre usually pretty funny.
---
Not sure what you read but it‚Äôs more likely that what you read was a mistake/typo
---
TWO TAILED FOX
---
They want to bring guns in space. Where there is no oxygen. Where an explosion can not happen. Good luck with the hive I guess
---
Can you also get it from fated Engrams, Thanks for the answer \^\^
---
It does subtract from your max light level. It only starts effecting your multiplier when it would put your light level closer to the recommended light for the nightfall (which is 540)
---
You think it‚Äôs a night watch or a manannan?
---
ever hear of a wake.
---
I cant do airborne kills, I just lose all accuracy. Ive mainly just been following teammates and kill stealing lol.
---
North East of the lost sector in the tangle
---
Use an app to unequip and store some primaries in vault. They should fix it
---
You win

Locking thread since there's nothing more to say.
---
The short answer: No, every copy of Forsaken comes with the year 1 content free. There are two ways to buy Forsaken, the legendary collection (just forsaken) and the complete collection (forsaken + annual pass).
---
Does the FAQ stickied to this subreddit help at all? If not, please post your question on the FAQ itself.
---
(This post has been removed as it is a very common duplicate question)
---
Key word: again
---
The fuck is going on in Alabama
---
It‚Äôs a stretch but I guess
---
Take truth off, apparently that can bug it?
---
You must kill an invader within 10 seconds of the invasion.
---
And the dreadnaught in Saturn‚Äôs ring is awesome to.
---
It's coming... Apparently Calus has it...
---
The chest is just somewhere in the plains it‚Äôs a scavenger hunt that changes every hour so you have to look everywhere there for it
---
Hope they figure out how to make bullets travel in a vacuum. Unless I'm just ignorant.
---
I run the same thing..... And yup that sounds about right... Sorry bud...
---
I'm there too and I can't find it either
---
As the killer or the killed?
---
Unfortunately I didn‚Äôt throw enough grenades
---
CPU then is probably the culprit?
---
I just deal with it honestly.... But yeah. Time for upgrades lol
---
It was good in Year 1, and is still a great PVE exotic. Before Forsaken, it was a great PVP because of its ease of use and great perks. It suffers now because it hasn't been tuned properly.
---
I just can't agree with you when there are people with 100+ clears who don't have the raid exotic.  13 was alright and I'm not here to complain about having to run it 13 times.  I'm saying there needs to be a safety net for edge cases, such as the 100+ club.  I don't think you can quite empathize with others enough to grasp what 100+ clears with no raid exotic would feel like.  Whether it's a top tier meta weapon or not, they're exotics that people desire, and pure RNG is not the way to reward it.
---
&gt; Gives you a goal, 
---
It's not a healthy goal.  Is your goal to roll a 100 sided dice and get it to land on 1-5?  That seems like it would be frustrating.  Why should your GOAL be to get lucky?  D2 has many other goals to pursue and some of us have limited gaming time.
---
&gt;and hits the same button a lootbox does without the money. 
---
Time = money.  Would you rather pay $1 to open a loot box (most games) or 1 hour?  My time is worth more than $1/hr.  Your entire opinion is based on the assumption that everyone has as much time to devote to the game as you do.  Sorry, the feeling of wasting an hour of my time watching LFG players make the dumb mistakes over and over isn't a feeling I play videogames to experience.
---
&gt; The good loot is on a pedestal. 
---
Are you talking about raid exotics?  They're literally locked behind RNG.  No pedestal.  Mountaintop, Recluse, you can say those are on a pedestal.  I thoroughly enjoyed those grinds and I thoroughly enjoyed having a meter I could see fill from 0-100% with tangible progress.  
---
Game mechanics that manipulate the player on an emotion level may be your cup of tea, but I guarantee you the majority of the community doesn't want there to be a 100+ clears with no raid exotic club.  Maybe if you could see from a perspective other than your own you'd understand.
---
Hey that's pretty neat
---
Delete this. Your time isn‚Äôt valuable so you can waste 10 minutes if need be. Tired of people bashing youtubers for going to the 10 minute mark. That‚Äôs there way of income.
---
Best part is Cozmo and DMG found this during playtest lmao. Honestly it probably wont be much of an issue as it takes some setting up to do.
