The thing has a built in aim bot. You dont have to aim at the head to get crits. You can aim at the waist, shoulder, left or right of head and the rounds go straight to the head. It seems bugged.
---

---
With that said....it doesnt need a nerf. Its frustrating to die to because of the lack of a need to know how to aim but leave it as is just fix the guaranteed crits on it.
---
---
---
They all say you need one person but that didn’t work and they talk about the version of it back when it would sit in your primaries
---
It may have alot of aim assist, but blast furnace has statistically alot more. It's not very good in PvP and playing against it is a breeze even when it has a clear advantage for range.
---
“Support”
---
Protocol is better don’t @ me
---
What about that Thrall lurking in a dark corner in the D1 Cosmodrome? My underleveled friend and I found that horrifying, especially since ww couldn’t do damage...
---
&gt; [I'm provably mistaken, and I don't want to acknowledge that, so I'm fleeing from confronting my own ignorance.]
---
21% for general add clear, bad omens for boss damage and or riven cheese. but generally GL with spikes have higher dps than rockets due to their speed and ammo capacity.
---
Linked to the ship and/or and after-ship quest.
---
I wouldn't win because you're playing against your ghost.

Your submission has been removed due to not being related to Destiny 2. Keep in mind, this includes content from Destiny 1, such as screenshots, or 'does anyone miss x'.
---
Omg, it would be glorious if instead we played as our Ghost with your concept. omg, bungie, make this happen
---
And here I thought it was gonna be a time-less (pun-intended) 
---
solo nightfall mission where everything is out to kill you while out fallen ally helps. Oh wrong I was.
---
I think your work is great

Those fucker know they're getting nova-bombed and tethered.

We're going wether those fuckers like it or not

Where’d you learn to do this? It’s really good.

Nice.

If she’s on laptop then why is there the console cursor

לא אתה, רבותי
---
you forgot to mention the void shanks at the start
---
Quite honestly I got crabby the 2nd time I got sunshot
---
You do some amazing work my man. I’m always curious to see the new art at the start of the videos. Keep up the spectacular work
---
Yeah get those English skills rolling.
---
Alright you've got me there lol I literally only know English and Latin lmao
---
NOW HOW DOES FEEL TO BE OUT GUNED but seriously though it’s just a game your going to find a way to out play people with this gun
---
Man, people have really fallen in love with this gun.
---
Indeed
---
Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with TR3-VR in the Old Tower...
---
Man I had the opening to Take Me Out by Franz Ferdinand playing and it for so perfectly.
---
That’s not the same for this though lol.  Plenty of people haven’t seen this.
---
Just curious if you have explosive rounds on that sniper..
---
Special K uses fun loadouts too. I'm like "ok I can relate to this" (cuz i'm a scrub)
---
Don't mind the KD it's tanked hard due to me being moron when i got the game which was in november...both were like .6 so i'm happy with my increase in "skill" and that i am getting higher KD's
---
And now to complete it on a level 11 character.
---
Me too. I probaby use it in way too many spots I shouldn't.
---
r/fireteams
---
I'm getting The Evil Within Shade vibes.
---
AH!
---
Oh i didn’t know thar sub existed 
---
Thanks!
---
with pleasure
---
Not from the Vanguard
---
My nades are nowhere near as powerful. What's the secret?
---
it’s a random drop from any forge completion. these do not require a weapon frame of any kind to drop
---
This dude probably doesnt have the gun and just salty about it.
---
true im scared of my own roomba when it just appears outta hell itself
---
I don't really see the correlation here.
---
The gun gets better the more people use it
---
I think a horror version of destiny would be pretty awesome
---
this would have worked better if i used malfeasance
---
[deleted]
---
Nice triple! But this also shows that Luna is not that easy to use. 1/5 shots landed and that too a body. I get it that it was high pressure environment but you still put out 5 shots towards a single target and only hit 1.
---
He has had good practice. A good deal of his life has been getting chased down by robots of death.

i love them, just lokking for a nice bad news XF

\^\^

I see, sorry about that.

I'll remove the post now, but I won't upload it again; there's no need for it anymore.

No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no

---
&gt; It’s not because this sub is the “meme board”

...

&gt;It’s that this video was posted for entertainment,

Oh yeah. 90% of the posts to this sub are memes.

Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes

u/TR3-VR
---
They could be bringing someone through the mission and showing them the route before they attempt it.
---
They could also be doing the Heroic version blind.
---
They could also be doing the void configuration and spent some time looking for keycards.
---
Im curious, do you always pick the humour out of humorous posts to act like you are above someone?
---
Why would anyone wish for this
---
I'm terrible at the jump puzzles, but got through Whisper and Whisper heroic with some very patient clan mates. lol 
---
Not looking forward to the jumping in Zero Hour, but I'll struggle through. :)
---
Didn't one of you guys get struck by lightning by punching the anomoly on the moon too much?
---
Xur gives each character the next invitation that individual character hasn't done, chronologically. So for example, if someone brought a brand new character to Xur, they would be offered the very first invitation. If someone was on a character that had done the 5th invitation, Xur would offer it the 6th invitation.
---
Like one min I may be into dudes the next I'm not type of thing lol.
---
I believe that you should be able to do all 9 Invitations even if you missed a week or started late, there won't be anything preventing you from seeing the cutscenes, the same way that they released the Uldren scene during the visit to Queen Mara's court.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
If you're doing it for the lore, then do the bounties on multiple characters. Each completion of the same weekly bounty will unlock the same cutscene, but a new lore entry.
---
I just wanna see the world burn
---
Okay, cool, thanks. So does that mean I can get multiple invitations in a week? Or do I still have to wait for the next Xur visit to get the next one?
---
I don’t want to have time to cook dinner while the npc catches up to me because I ran ahead 15 feet
---
BURN
---
Honestly one my biggest turnoffs for mmos
---
See that giant crater in the distance ? Yep. That was us. Great times.
---
Pay to win confirmed
---
It’s been 36 minutes
---
Seems like someone is salty. I’m not gonna make myself out to be the most elite as I’m mostly stuck ‘round 1600 but I’ve been Fabled &amp; Legend far before the “the Revelry”. I thought it was fun to break crucible for little bit. PvP has been so stale.
---
Looks like you got your Bygones from McDonalds..
---
Ah okay. Never watched the show but I see that now
---
There was a system in place where different activities had different soft caps. 
---
An activity’s powerful drops would be around +5ish until you reached the soft cap for its drops where it would only be +1 or +2. 
---
 This system has been bashed around a bit over the course of the last few updates but that is more or less how it worked. It’s not going to be a huge jump like you were thinking at any point outside of the couple seasonal events we have had where they had an associated legendary that was guaranteed to drop at the current max power.
---
Definitely something you should watch. It gets funnier the more you stick with it
---
I know if you kill a track
---
Tank with whisper, it doesn't matter how many shots, it procs white nail
---
it sucks man. i heard someone say if you stop playing the game for a week or two exotics will start dropping which doesnt make any sense. why would i want to stop playing the game to be rewarded thats so dumb. like award me for playing the damn game
---
How many is “unthinkable”? Not trying to trash talk, but you’d be surprised how low the drop rate still is for exotics.
---
r/flatearth
---
you are right lad
---
a well done post on a shitty game mode, but of course the reddit mods and fan boys are gonna downvote to make it harder to make our voices heard
---
I'll probably get back into their games and get the dlc's and then end up playing it a lot
---
*vroom vrooms behind you*
---
Nothing personnel kid
---
At least I'm guaranteed something good from the Engram this week.
---
SCP-093 Deep Sea Object
---
"Hello, what's this?" is a more likely base.
---
The NPCs are still there, they just don't do anything.
---
This is totally normal, I think if you progress your milestones a certain amount, their map markers will go away, but they will still be there. Everyone's game is like this.
---
Since it’s buff, Lord of Wolves is absolutely insane so i would have to recommend that, Whisper if you have it, Prospector too  along with IKELOS_SG as a back up maybe and DARCI **all for DPS in WoR**
---
i know you said as clear but the newly released Arbelest is really good for everything and one-shots all elemental shields just so you know
---
For ad clear i’d use Hammerhead, Delirium(**which is also good for DPS**) or a well-rolled Blast Furnace/Duke Mk.44/Whatever
---
What a "Legend".
---
Wait that’s illegal
---
DOOMBA
---
Good luck my friend
---
Ok, yeah we’ve got one of us running Arbalest, that thing is insane, one shots the shanks. I’ve been swapping between riskrunner/sleeper/thunderlord. And last guy has been staying with riskrunner. Haven’t thought of DARCI, that’s a good idea. Idk about the lord of wolves buff though. What did they do to it?
---
Bring back Cayde, my boy for 4 years and they kill him off
---
You can do it just on patrol actually, you don't need it to be that combination to get the transponder.
---
I don't and never have had these faction leaders marked on my map, just booted it up to check
---
Shh lemme have my fun
---
Nope; need to reroll. The only thing you should lose would be anything in the pursuits tab of that character's inventory (as well as the progress of any active pursuits). Equip some junk gear and put everything else in the vault.
---
Camron said stop snitchin
---
When your fireteam hits the boss with all 3 burns
---
well no actually, went into the patrol, still locked and i have completed enemy of my enemy
---
Surprisingly, the best way to contact them is through their official channels [Bungie.net](https://Bungie.net) and bungie on twitter, or in game.
---
That happens to a few people but it has nothing to do with the heroic mission, my nephew had to talk to Sloane to turn in something even though he had Rat King already, but after he did he was able to open the door while in patrol, outside of the mission.
---
There's unfortunately no way to change how your Guardian looks yet (I would be surprised if this doesn't get added to Eververse at some point in the future), you'll have to delete them and start over.
---
  
---
As for as things lost, it should just be whatever is in their inventory and attached specifically to them, such as Seeds of Light, Exotic Weapon Bounties, and everything equipped to them. It won't stop any progress on your triumphs or anything. I guess maybe your Crucible and Gambit ranks will reset as well.
---
Thanks haha! (I'm Kuramashi)
---
Replace the S in hollows with an O and you get OWO. Just sayin
---
So keep hanging in there. Got it! Thank you for answering my guy!
---
Do you both have the quests? If no, that's why?
---
Right? He was sitting in there like “wait what aren’t you supposed to be dead?” 😂
---
Sorry everyone, Clouds at sea, Rampage and outlaw with accurized rounds and range masterwork with a rampage spec

There's both eggs and skulls in Shattered throne

Take it easy man. No need to get shitty about it. He doesn't get to spam nades and folks that relied on that cheap stuff go back to getting wrecked.
---
Sorry everyone, it’s Rampage and outlaw with accurized rounds and a range masterwork. With a rampage spec
---
You know it
---
I shall teach you, young padiwan
---
In the moment I just accepted my death but Trevor was like nah
---
F
---
Ohhhh dammm the influence of the praxic order is strong  with you young one .
---
did you actually go into your inventory and *use* the polymer?
---
because the polymer absolutely cannot drop anything except for armor.
---
Yeah its RA, as long as you complete it this season you're all good. :)
---
The rng gods must not like you. I've had three or 4 drop this week.
---
&gt;This was also before items could have random rolls, so you’d be getting 20+ copies of a handful of perfectly identical weapons for your efforts.
---
And yet despite opening 50+ Dead Orbit packages I never got the Dire Promise ;(.
---
Welp. Live and learn I guess? I meant it to be more funny than serious. Some people’s humor is different though, and that’s ok. I respect that
---
"the tower" was glitched and now we are punished if we didn't do "the tower" in 2 days

this makes me sad  
---

---
Use a tincture with it equipped.
---
You mean what has happened in Forsaken's story or Forsaken's gameplay?
---
I find it kinda rude to just say "Play it and find out" but a *lot* has happened since the Forsaken campaign, so even if I try to answer I probably won't be able to cover everything.
---
Death roomba gives no shits about your need for weapons
---
The one using to complete its catalyst. If not, izanagi or arbalesta to pair with the recluse, Jotunn with Breakneck or duty bound (until i get a smg with good perks), or tractor cannon/whisper of the worm for raids
---
That’s bungo for ya
---
Why not 6 more ;)
---
Tinctures do not work with weapons.
---
Only gear that Tinctures change, are the Dreaming City armours
---
First time through this I never expected this box bot to be there. First I saw the ominous red like and then I realized there was something behind me. A good spook moment.
---
So it would seem.
---
What is that, the outbreak perfected quest?
---
well I solo-grinded for a month in Oct to get the in game gun. It was a big enough deal for me that I decided to buy it. It is A LOT smaller than I thought it'd be haha especially after they said they were making them "bigger" and thats why they were delayed. BUT all in all I think its cool enough, and looks cool next to all my other little things. GG Bungie
---
It is NOT DDoS. It sounds like wintrading. You can try contacting bungie, but at worst he'll have his not forgotten taken away and more realistically nothing will be done. As of now bungie only does bans for confirmed actions that inhibit the experience of other players like DDoS'ing or that give a player an unfair advantage through 3rd party means. Win-trading, while definitely cheating doesn't break either rule as it A) doesn't hurt another persons experience and B) usually doesn't use a third party tool/software to accomplish it. It's really people taking advantage of the Peer 2 Peer matchmaking's flaws and has been a thing since Destiny 1.
---
Don’t worry mane, in the lore i have for my guardian that I’ve made he has an awoken girl
---
To shreds you say...

Yes
