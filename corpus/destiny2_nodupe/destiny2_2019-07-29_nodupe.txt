I've been seeing this sentiment a lot this iron banner, that it's been miserable. Is it pc players reacting to LOW? I'm on ps4 and honestly I've been loving this IB. My w in ratio isn't anything spectacular probably 50% but my k/d has been stellar and I'm feeling really strong gameplay wise. It's amazing what a little matchmaking can do.

goddammit... take my upvote

Always go for first to bank. Gold medals are worth more so wipe the entire enemy team when you invade. Don't die so you can pick up kill monger. Really just play the game.
---
If you play 3 games in a week then wait till reset, you get a little over 100 points. You could do that if you wanted to.
---
Thanks. I just found the location where it is.
---
There are a lot of non-guardians working in the tower, and I think that now that we don't have Cayde-6 to push back on this, there's a real good chance that we can get Space-OSHA its teeth back.
---
What about god of war?

Iron banner in a nutshell

Have fun trying to get scout rifle kills against sweat KD farmers all using meta stuff

This thread‚Äôs OP: *breathes*

40 downvotes: no

lol thanks. if i kill you while you have it equipped i want you to know that you deserved it üòÅ
---
I play on xbox but yeah iv been really trying to get the hang of scourge of the past through matchmaking but I am just so clearly the pvp guy getting carried lol
---
You can play private matches with friends still in D1. I believe you can‚Äôt get the gear anymore but you can still experience it
---
There‚Äôs no need to make this post as anyone who has use of their thumbs can outplay/ignore OEM, no need to be sorry for not doing anything thet deserves penance
---
Guess Gahl-ran outta there amirite
---
There is no grenade, except the handheld supernova, that can one hit kill. An arc web nade does roughly half your health. So unless you were damaged then I do not see how that was a 1 hit. Also, it‚Äôs an arc WEB it‚Äôs suppose to reach out in all directions.
---
this has happened to me at gauntlet before too
---
I mean they nerfed it in the sense you can‚Äôt get new stuff from bright engrams only Y1 stuff.
---
Yeah i think so
---
Am I the only one who thinks team-shooting is more of a thing now than in year one?
---
This only happens to me when Im olaying at 4 am in during work week. When the player count in my regions is at the lowest.
---
Cringe
---
It kinda is on PC when a clan of bored comp-stompers is in a quick play match with me
---
Man can never be hot
---
dont worry once shadowkeep comes you will be able to apply it as an ornament to any armor 2.0 cloak
---
F, i just got it done for my friend in about an hour or 2 a week after it came out. The only real problem was the blood for blood medals that came after since I had to watch a crap teammate die the avenge them
---
You‚Äôre sleeping on it buddy

Keep us updated!

LoW I'm fine with but honestly I feel the tracking on Jotunn is a little excessive on console. I've literally watched it curve around corners and hit people. I'm fine with high damage weapons as long as there's a counter or some down side to using it. LoW and fusion rifles take bursts to kill if you miss a few rounds you get punished. Jotunn can miss and still kill you.
---
Mr. Pie, need a wing man?  Not much of a PVP player but willing to help you grind.
---
Already had one? Any lore on that? Not sure how anyone could have learned how to tear a pocket in the fabric of reality using the magical power of massacre before the hive
---
i heard this Tuesday is when it‚Äôll be in your inventory or maybe Tessa might have it not sure where tho
---
Something all guardians should agree on doing .

It's from when they deciphered the Niobe lab

Its out tuesday

I can already see it as our guardian travels to Collapse Era Cosmodrome and malevolent voice growls, ‚ÄúLittle light, you‚Äôve strayed too far from your time.‚Äù
---
For me it‚Äôs whenever I lose a crucible match but still end up getting 5 sniper kills for revoker
---
Probably the 6v6 playing on maps designed for 4v4. Some maps are fine tbh, but some seem tiny
---
Recluse is the best gun right now, mountain top is a good pair with it but the quest is dumb as fuck. I enjoy playing loaded question but recluse is better, windego is pretty good but not sure if it is essential.
---
That chest piece is the most aesthetic titan chest piece

Currently 50% with hand cannon quests, and many of them have sat slowly progressing as I'm a terrible pvper.

Is there an approximate for the Revenant Destiny 1 dead orbit shader in D2?

Hoping it makes a return in Shadowkeep

Worst feeling in the world, especially when you were on a throwing knife killstreak then BANG and youre dead

I'm no God but I definitely dont suck. Maintained a consistent KD throught the entire game.
---
Really I'm gonna have to be the one to say it...they're evolving! Call the vanguard, get the teams ready!
---
Noop, just have a decent crucible game, perks and mods relevant to play style and correct class exotic for nade kills

Apparently you didn‚Äôt if the iron banner quest took you a long time.

Your a titan main I bet lawl

Wait two days, and you‚Äôre guaranteed it! Don‚Äôt play another damn game! lol

i played a crucible match and at the end i got it, is that not a way to say it?

No a hunter like most of the population, my titan is still 650.

Abit too tricky to do on consoles but I get what you mean.
---

H-his name man. Fuck just take it.
---
the only time you should run double primaries in crucible is if you use TLW or recluse, thats a  handicap loadout, get a special man

Which is what I'm on about

You cant tell me hunter grenades arent absolute trash then

I heared 180 rpm hand cannons are good on console, so try getting yourself a good service revolver (check falloutplays for a good role), also try and practice with last word, if you cam get good at using it, you'll be able to easily win a lot of your 1v1 engagements. I know it's not as good on console as it is in pc, but still, it's the best dueling weapon regardless. Try getting yourself a quickdraw snapshot shotgun, easiest to get would be mindbender's, with accuraized rounds rifled barrel and a range MW, it's range stuff are not a must, but they help a lot.
---
Check out top pvpers, streamers, youtubers, and try to take notes from their movements, and map awareness, and they move arround the map.
---
Be aware of where your teammates are, cuz that will give you an idea of where the enemies will spawn. Dont wanna go run into 5 people spawning in unless you have a super or a wardcliff.
---
If you're in comp and notice the enemy team has a lot of supers, consider switching from one eyed mask to a peregrine grives, to get a quick shutdown on the super, or just keep in mind that you can switch exotica mid game.
---
As for builds, you might wanna use something
---
Service revolver, mindbender's, wardcliff or truth or any heavy you like
---
One eyed mask with handcannon targeting, gauntlet with shotgun scavenger, chest with unflinching handcannon aim, boots with enhanced shotgun or handcannon dex. The handcannon targeting really puts in work. And the shotgun scavenger helps a lot with the ammo economy, and the unflinching helps a lot in gun fights. If you don't have one of these things you can do just fine without it.
---
Tell me when hunter grenades were good besides when I could stick trip mines or one shot with a sticky in d1.
---
I would rather Truth over Hammerhead, at least against Truth I can snipe them while the rocket is on its way to fuck me, against hammerhead it's next to impossible because of flinch
---
Wait for the next reset and you‚Äôre golden. Keep on slayin‚Äô Guardian!
---
anyone want a hug? no? no hugs...
---
mans had 100% accuracy with a Duke according to Destiny Tracker haha
---
But you said doing it gives you 2.0 armor, and I am asking you why you say that.
---
Is that Tobias Fornell of of the FBI?
---
Okay but TBH the new solar handcannon in Shadowkeep looks really cool
---
Then don‚Äôt play it, you‚Äôre not getting rewards unless you do the activity
---
Kinda the point here.. they're not good in d2 üòÇ
---
As s Titan I feel your pain
---
Make this a quest weapon where you start with the broken sword and build it up to an exotic one
---
How do you get goldleaf?
---
Thanks mate
---
Honestly erentil is OP until u get killed by It then u switch to your "ima snipe this nerd" loadout
---
Werner should have them

‚ÄúTHIS IS A MAZE!‚Äù

Now if they stop making armor with certain parts that are perma-colored this would be perfect

Yeah, I missed it at first too, took me a bit to realize what he was talking about

Probably blast radius

Nice play man that jump snipe is making you look like a pro!
---
Probably that, haven‚Äôt gotten a chance to play with it

Same dude, I‚Äôve done bounties on three characters and have gotten none with spikes.

I mean I can‚Äôt be the only one who punches it if I‚Äôm full and there‚Äôs only one

Ok, thank you
---
Then it turns into the raze lighter
---
I slugged through it in myhem and just spammed colony. When mayhem wasn't active I used tether in comp and then used fighting lion to get instant multikills
---
Dude im doing the step where you deposit motes and win games right now and I have a mini heart attack when Ive got 10 motes and im clearing blockers and then my screen goes red
---
Weird, I've played at 748 to advance the bounties quicker and my shields have been consistently a OHK.

I finished the vanilla campaign in February and found him in the tower. Next time I came he was gone.
---
This is actually a pic of my kinetic slot inventory...

I'm in this picture, and I like it.

I suffered the scout kills more than the grenades, and that's saying something.
---
All those handcanons and still no Hawkmoon, feelsbadman
---
Mate, he doesn't understand how it works.
---
I've always found the easiest solution would be running backwards would do it but then that would create other weird problems like baiting in Crucible or something.
---
I tried to hitch a ride on a Fallen ship that clipped into the ground and I also fell
---
I'm gonna do more tries on harder modes like reckoning and menagerie.  I think its more suited for these kind of modes. Like escalation protocol. Fewer mechanics and lots of adds. Were healing is more important. As long as u have 1 ammo. U can block/heal indefinatly as a survival tool. I even managed to slash then block a suicide vex drone and fallen exploding shank. It just can t compete with the specialized weapon load outs for raids. Wisper. Grenade launchers. Wardcliff coil. Legend acrius. So good for everything else I'm guessing . anyways im still in the testing phase trying to parry all kinds of attack from vex pools to dark zones.
---
It's quite cool. Not the most original idea, but well edited.

I ended up opting for lightweight scouts, still a 4-tap

---
They put loads of rooms in when they added the annex. I assume it‚Äôs just future proofing for more vendors in upcoming DLCs (similar to Ada, drifter etc)
---
I avg 30-40 almost every crucible match and top of my team every gambit match dude. I know how special ammo guns work also. I just don‚Äôt use them. I seldom use shot guns at all especially not dust rock blues. I prefer a pulse rife and hand cannon. I only use specials when solo nightfalls and raids.
---
well the planet is tidally locked (always the same side to the sun) andhas basically no atmosphere so on the eternal day side its like 200+c and deadly radiation and on the night side its ‚Äì200c
---
Check byf's channel, he probably has a video on it
---
Quick question, I don‚Äôt have any friends that play often nor do I really like communication via mics etc. 
---
Do you think there‚Äôs a way to solo the leviathan
---
[I‚Äôd like to report a bruh moment](https://youtu.be/2ZIpFytCSVc)
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt know why but I watched Datto‚Äôs video on super good advice recently
---
Oh god, oh god, not temporary.
---
Oh, it's not a thing. I mean as a gameplay addition. Probably shoulda been more clear.
---
Well I mean I mostly play pve, hence the armour, and was just doing solo 100k nightfall, using Juton for that is a good strat
---
there is a small band of eternal dusk, but in the absence of air or any other medium to hold the warmth, stepping from the sunlight into the shadow means a pretty instantanious temperature drop. That being said on the cold side youd propably still die from heat since near  vacuum is just about the best isolator you could wish for so youd cook yourself still
---
Keep going at it, it‚Äôs worth the grind and even if it feels impossible, it‚Äôs definetly doable, maybe try lfg for a team that‚Äôs in the same position as you, and when you‚Äôre solo queueing try matching up with people on your team after the game if they played well and see if they wanna play more matches with you. It‚Äôs not always easy but give it enough time and you‚Äôll get it
---
Works better if you dont kill yourself. I'm sure if you had a titan variant of a blade barrage that other people cant dodge youd feel right at home. Titans require finesse and patience.
---
Would it rile you more if I told you the other energy weapon I had was LoW
---
First of all, crucible is all titans have, second I already use the jotunn and if you die by it, you were way to slow and deserve it.
---
Then stop whining. There's an update from AMD on the 30th regarding this issue and others.

Just but the forsaken complete collection, because with shadowkeep pre-order you won't get forsaken.

I dunno what it is but D1 PVP was so much fun for me I could sit for hours, but on D2 i feel atm especially its terrible, to much nooby stuff in the game, to many one shot kills, majority of maps on d2 feel terrible, i only really like the re made maps.
---
I believe you are forgetting about stickynades
---
You traitorous beast!
---
Only thing I don‚Äôt like from pvp is the shotguns. Literally the only thing that literally can kill my fun. Cus I can do good with a normal gun and destroy the enemy team but once the shotguns come out its over for me. And I refuse to be a shitcan like that
---
i betrayed trust but i just couldnt resist
---
Well it could be a side affect of the fact that d2 multiplayer was made with 4v4 in mind but the community begged for 6v6 and so now Bungie is desperately trying to accommodate pvp to compensate for this.  And there was just as many one shot kills in d1 they were just tired to different aspects of the multiplayer experience
---
I understand the urge. And I am truly unsure as to what I may have done had I been in the same situation.
---
Stuck in heroic 3 on pc. It's hard as f as a solo.

Congrats dude !

*I can grant your wish, just wish it*

Alien poop.

play a ton of crucible lol
---
THATS WHAT IM SAYIIIING!!! I just want my Xenos Vale warlock chestpiece üò≠üò≠üò≠ it cant be that hard to create a system to where year 1 and 2 armor can be brought to armor 2.0. Maybe have the ability to make old armor into universal ornaments through eververse?
---
Yeah I notice certain weapons and exotics just make PvP an entirely unfair endeavor. Which is why I don't play it !
---
Hatin OEM isn‚Äôt about shotgun aping though......
---
Lol pretty much
---
I agree, there are some things in the game that are OP. LoW and etc, but that also makes them predictable. It‚Äôs all about mind games when it comes down to it.
---
Yeah, ace and last word I did about 60-75% of their quest steps without realising it
---
ZeroLenny would instantly start playing Destiny
---
E'rday!
---
But it IS a problem. On console, I literally refuse to use boots without traction. And heavy ammo finder is Key in most pve engagements. Along with dexterity and reload speed perks I heavily disagree with you.
---
Thu‚Äôum

I saw a guardian the other day named Isnipedyourgranny

Ethan Hawke did it during his training day...

Glad you're enjoying the stories. Its really rare to see another person who actually liked Curse of Osiris. Many people hate it. Im sure you're gonna enjoy Forsaken!
---
I don't know if it's been explicitly said, but in the trailer they feature Guardians playing with Year 1 and Year 2 armor. Not sure if that means anything, but I just assumed they wouldn't show them using outdated gear if they didn't plan on making them relevant again in some way.
---
One of the shaders from the mercury packages from brother Vance could work. It‚Äôs called Kairos Gold.
---
well they announced reworks to the crucible gamemodes, hired a professional crucible player and talked about trials of the nine in an interview.
---
So things are looking up in my opinion
---
Everyone does.
---
Reeeeeeeeeeeeepost
---
What's that perk to the right of Field Prep?
---
I feel you
---
Not just that I‚Äôm pretty sure in VoG you get deleted from reality.
---
This is interesting. Message me if you figure it out pls.
---
As a warlock main I disapprove of this but will not be angered by other opinions
---
It's gotta be from using it in Gambit along with a little bit in PvP then. I thought the kill tracker that wasn't for crucible only tracked non-guardian kills? Maybe I was wrong about that. 
---
But yeah some of it's definitely from Gambit and PvP so that's gotta be what the difference is.
---
It's probably one of the dreaming city eggs. They are collectibles that you have to shoot with the exotic bow, Wish Ender.
---
I‚Äôm on console too and can‚Äôt tell a difference if I‚Äôm wearing boots with traction or without. I also don‚Äôt have much of a problem with heavy ammo. I think it‚Äôs the placebo effect.
---
I love calling that area Anor Londo
---
Ah thank you, i havent managed to get wish ender yet but I might make it priority now
---
Can't think of one offhand, but you might check r/DestinyFashion as well. They might have an answer for ya.
---
You have til ShadowKeep or you‚Äôll have to reach fabled again.
---
You have until the end of the season, meaning until Shadowkeep releases.
---
None exxept engrams and consumables.

Staff slide is the most cha cha real smooth move in the game

Lol Byf really do be like that sometimes

Wow. Curse of Osiris was really enjoyable. So good! Forsake shall be great!

hmmmmmmmmm  Calls me a liar because i state facts? ok pumpkin,  next time i get a video i will enjoy posting it to make you look like a fool blown idiot.

All I can hear is Parks and Rec in my head. "Don't be suspicious."
---
Did you get it for pve? That was the only reason I suffered through solo queuing
---
The first thing i  did was do the 690 quest from Werner on Nessus. I would say this mission should be your priority. It‚Äôs not very hard at all. I don‚Äôt exactly remember the requirements for starting the quest but it wasn‚Äôt hard at all. Just look up a walkthrough of the quest. After that I got outbreak perfected because I wanted it.
---
I started doing the weekly stuff again like crucible and nightfalls to build my light. As I was playing the game, wanting specific weapons like the black armory sniper brought me to check out the dlc stuff. Each one only added a handful of things. I hit 750 2 days ago. I would help walk you through but I‚Äôm going on vacation for 10 days. But you can ask me anything you want here and I‚Äôll answer! Good luck!

Dude, you‚Äôre awesome.  Thanks for the insight.  I‚Äôll hit thar quest and probably go for outbreak as well.  I got mine in d1 2 days after it dropped, one of my favorite weapons of all time next to bad juju.  Have a good vacation!

Its just the Dark Below but on Mercury, but the raid was worse imo

It's supposed to balanced by the charge time, but I keep running into these kids who started charging it juuuuuust at the right moment to fire it as soon as we become visible to each other.
---
And get drop mag if you ever want it to reload.

Thanks! Bad juju is out to if you want to get that. Look up a video

Guardians can survive bullets to the face and being stomped on by gigantic monstrosities but our toes are just so sensitive

It‚Äôs all good man.  I appreciate your willingness to help out.  Thanks for the info.  Starting the 690 gear quest right now then I‚Äôm gonna grab outbreak perfected ü§ò
---
What is an infinity gun?
---
lol just get gud bro.
---
And what
---
I don‚Äôt get it either.   It went in one side and came out the other to kill me.
---
What was his name?
---
Well now I have.
---
Same! I feel like it only works 50% of the time because I get shotgunned before the animation finishes
---
It worked
---
This, I‚Äôve been trying to introduce my brother to the game but he can‚Äôt finish any crucible quests where he loses progress on death because every game there are mountaintop+recluse+OEM players everywhere.  Where did the SBMM go?  A brand new player shouldn‚Äôt be playing against these guys in crucible.
---
üòè oh shit.  I hope it‚Äôs as good as I remember.  Again, thanks for the heads up.
---
1st what the actual hell
---
2nd congratulations
---
Big fax
---
Same but for Anarchy in SotP.
---
Yea, it looks like your super animation completed before the ball even touched your bubble. I didn't notice any signs of lag. I'm stumped.
---
You should really be using an item manager if you want to be efficient. destinyitemmanager.com or the Ishtar Commander app are both excellent
---
Haha I always amde this joke with my clan. "Alright boys we goin back to Anor Londo"
---
Ahhh. I didn't know that was the only place you could get it. (That's where I got mine) I just figured knowing the irony that is Xur/Bungie.
---
Oh cool thanks

You don't deserve a recluse if you can't aim with it.
---
Any cancer comp gets outplayed by skill my guy, One eyed Lord of wolves can't benefit if their constantly getting sniped out before they close the distance. on top of that if you struggle against the LoW One eye meta just play into it. No ones gonna stop using it because you shame them so just use the gun better than they do.
---
ergo, you do not understand the definition of "toxic".
---
&gt;and iirc this also allows you to avoid stomp
---
So does the normal attack (if you are healthy enough to not need the block dmg reduction ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø)
---
Are you talking about the ornament? In that case no, the engrams this season are year one eververse items only.
---
But if you mean the gun itself, it‚Äôs from the last wish raid, you would hear a lot of fire and pitchforks if a raid exotic could be received through loot boxes lol
---
It‚Äôs only given from unlocking chests at the end of the last wish raid
---
It offends me that there are rules in place, those rules are not being followed, and no one seems to care. 
---
Fuck me for trying to follow the rules I guess. I guess no one here (including mods) cares about them at all.
---
Lets just get rid of all the rules then!
---
It‚Äôs ok. But honestly you‚Äôll have way more fun with friends or a group. Tons of clans are always looking for people to join.
---
Thank you sir.
---
If on xbox, try the built-in LFG tool on the parties tab.
---
If on PC or PS4, try one of the many LFG methods listed at the top of the sub including the Destiny companion app or r/fireteams. If you're looking for other players to play with, it's a good idea to mention what platform you are playing on, and what kind of play you are hoping to do.
---
1k voices is only available as a random drop from the chests at the end of the Last Wish raid.
---
Battle robes and dress is like when I was a kid and my sister would call my action figures "dolls." F*ck u Melanie
---
No we don‚Äôt
---
I wouldnt mind playing with others, its just that i dont have a standard group of freinds i know irl they all play different games
---
Just use rat king smh
---
Here the deal my guy, I solo'd to 4.3k so far this season. How? playing a shit ton and getting to 3.5 just to drop to 1.9. You gotta grind it out and play into meta's, I dont enjoy saying this but if you have the One Eye LoW combo use it while its active. and reach out to better players as most are done with the season anyways and try and get some help there are plenty of sherpa's. Now finally yeah you need skill, so if you can hit shit like me you gotta warm up your brain and make good plays and call outs and just all an all keep a calm demeanor.
---
That backflip headshot got me fucking GASSED
---
Dammit that was funny
---
They‚Äôre tons of clans and LFGs to find people.
---
With the new expansion in September it's barely cheese in the cracker for the deluxe version and it gives from a year of content and fresh content every 3 months, most big games don't do that.
---
On regards to not having RL friends to play with join a clan with a discord group that communicates and plays to your region
---
Thanks
---
I hope you're joking.
---
6 plus well can do it. Imagine 100 Naruto runners and a Furret with cluster rockets.
---
I don't have people I play with regularly, though it's easy to meet people in game. I just use the LFG tool to find a group when I want to do a group activity. Some activities have matchmaking anyway.
---
Thate smooth
---
Super ** lol
---
I took a 3 week break because god knows what I‚Äôm doing tomorrow
---
I never got 21% so that‚Äôs really the only reason I‚Äôm still doing it.

I just hope that whatever changes they make, they give us numbers.

No sweat guys. I've got Well, lunafaction and a tractor cannon.

Just DONT hit the eyes, got it?

The first thing I saw was the super bar. I dont trust hunters at all.

Sry I don‚Äôt play a lot
---
This is too funny
---
You could also go into any lost sector during a strike and those would count also.
---
As they removed the Cayde Treasure Maps, I don't think it's possible to get it any more unfortunately.
---
The only thing I grinded for was Hush because I really like bows.
---
That *was* worth it.
---
Fuck you.
---
I mean if you turn the image on it‚Äôs side it kinda looks like a sword with some imagination haha
---
Exotic Perk: Take guns and add them to All for One, and hope some thrall doesn‚Äôt Texas Smash you
---
this games pvp is the worst and i completely disagree with putting them into this picture. destiny 2 pvp is so bad nobody plays it.
---
You just used ward cliff coil on tethered enemies tho
---
Im just here to throw hammers or shields, or dive bomb to my death depending on burn.
---
now use tickle fingers while wearing a pheonix protocol and stay in the well and youll keep getting your super back.
---
According to the post in destiny's website, it looks like the players who are aiming to get the emblem should use lord of wolves in at least one match
---

---
when you lose a ranked crucible match but you also get the respawn bug every game, so you just watch your team play with either 3 man not spawning or just you and see that nice rank drop down to guardian 0 so u can just quit the game.
---
Good to see a buff to hunters. They can now teleport and move at EXTREME speeds
---
More barons
---
Bump
---
Sorry epic gamer god
---
Oh boy have I been there
---
The Lord of Lean fights back
---
Would have
---
He's able to sell it, that's how I got mine
---
I disagree. The damage boost it grants for ANY weapon kill is absurd. The fact that you don‚Äôt even need to aim for the head after getting the damage boost is also absurd.
---
class? console?
---
Yup. Everyone that owns the base game has both CoO and Warmind
---
Especially when paired with tractor cannon.
---
Dunemarchers are Titan only and Ps4 my good sir
---
God. :30 in. Collision rebound is one of THE most frustrating things in this entire game. It's beyond infuriating to be attempting to navigate a jumping puzzle, jump from a sprint and keep the momentum, only to hit a ledge and bounce off WITHOUT GETTING MY JUMP BACK.
---
That ain‚Äôt your typical glimmer
---
peeeerfect...
---
Hammers with sunspot on is better
---
Slideshot reloads a shell when you slide..
---
Dodge as a hunter breaks aim assist and can get u behind cover this just makes it better
---
&gt; julep
---
Greetings, fellow whiskey lover...
---
Yeah, thank God they nerfed the 5500 pinnacle weapon that so few people had. Everyone who complained about it has probably seen their KD double since the nerf, right?
---
Oh, wait. Nope, they're still bad, and if they're on console they're still getting killed by Luna's and NF. Lol.
---
Strange moment of autocorrect lol
---
God of War was the great of all time....of ALL time.
---
Thanks for this!
---
To be fair... it would be fun shooting pokemon with destiny weapons
---
How this Guardians flex without their box logo?
---
Everyone saying it's just rocket on tethered people it's still a team wipe lol
---
Anyone else notice that it looks like arbiter is doing a dab on the bottom
---
Who else finished the foresaken campaign in like 2 hours?
---
They never claimed it would be more than what it was, and apparently Vicarious or whoever worked on it broke the whole Sparrow thing.
---
Cayde died?!? Spoilers man!
---
Yea
---
yep, lemme just get my Cerberus+1
---
The good old days of Shockwave FoH...
---
I WAS NOT EXPECTING THAT, thank you for making my day lmao
---
Yea I didn‚Äôt want to crop the photo
---
10/10
---
you cant
---
Ah, I worded it badly.
---
Eh. It was ok, but tbh I preferred the Escolation armor cuz it kind of reminded me of a cyborg version of the kings fall armor (the helmet did at least)
---
am i the only one that gets White power ranger vibe from this hunter helmet.
---
They are fighting over a single glimmer while I‚Äôm out here at max cap
---
Also shows how bad ass Ada really is
---
If you honestly believe that you're straight up delusional. OEM is at minimum Wormhusk and Foetracer combined.
---
Please no, I get Recluse at reset.
