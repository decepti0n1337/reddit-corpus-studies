Waaat, it's the Zavala voice actor, so atleast loosly related 🤪
---
---
---
Seems legit,
---
I also have work.
---
Banana, the potassium mind
---
I know who he is, it's just not related to the game in any way. I hope you can understand this.
---
Exactly like my first fireteam in GoS.
---
Where does it ever say he was an arcstrider? I've never seen this mentioned referenced or written anywhere and Googles coming up with a blank
---
Saw the title and knew exactly what was about to go down
---
Hehe, not my post, I was just joking about it :)
---
He is funny in [corporate ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_(TV_series))
---
cheers bro, im just new to d2
---
Sorry but actually every time someone punches a psion they get teleported to the void.
---
If you’re talking Bane of Tyrants ship, I got it after my one and only run. So in my experience the drop rate is 100%. Wait sorry, 33% my fireteam teammates didn’t get the ship.

Chasm of Screams.
---
I get it that a group would make it go quicker - really not in my best interest or the randoms that would be with me. I’m prone to more mistakes and generally just fucking everything up. 
---

---
That’s why I was wondering if there is a particular loadout or so to make this a bit easier
---
I do when I play comp, but I enjoy control when I’m not playing comp. I just want good, close games more often than 1 out of every 10-15
---
Can the baby yoda format get banned already? I can’t remember the last time I’ve seen a meme get beaten into the ground so quickly.
---
Fuck that 😂
---
There symbols are chalice, dogs, axes, sun. Is that what you mean?
---
Hm, why not just pick up the quest?
---
Yes but why. I'm so confused and i have no idea whats going on anymore in this game
---
Now your the god of war
---
I did this in the first five hours by accident, now I'm on hour 45 and still haven't gotten pillager. Kill me.
---
Bye then?
---
Easy way to tell is check to see if there is a catalyst spot
---
Well arc singe plus wardcliff coil will almost one shot the boss. If you have the oppressive darkness artifact mod it might kill him outright (Don’t quote me on this I haven’t tried it). Other than that I would run top tree nightatalker for add control
---
I need the SMG, I feel your pain.
---
Yes!
---
In one entry he mentions using flux grenades as a counter measure and was confused about why didn't go off, guardians can switch subclasses at will though
---
You mean the exploit that was patched?
---
I'm pretty sure all of the year two exotics have upgrades, they just aren't I'm game yet
---
Unlucky , I got it on 5th run
---
It’s as simple as you’re confused
---
D. A. R. C. I
---
I've got one with subsistence, demolitionist and then perks with range which fits so good with my nade build, but the damage feels really lacking for me...
---
The goblin that popped into my match last night was definitely protecting the primeval.
---
QuickDraw/snapshot sounds great. Perfectly serviceable roll if it has full choke/rifled and accurized/light/assault mag.
---
I liked the brief moment watching the supers fight each other. 
---
10/10 quality content.
---
Bounties i think
---
Agreed, elemental affinity shouldn’t be apart of exotic armor. Period.
---
Yea it’s a pretty quality piece
---
You sir get an upvote regardless. Excellent photog
---
This week strike scarleet keep  is a little bit difficult than others , big openfield enemy could shoot you from anywhere , boss arena is small and enemy will swarm you ,  rule of thumb while attempting higher difficult mission "SHOOT THE FROM 10 ANOTHER PLANET " , fuck recluse let's use scout rifle and sniper. 
---
You can switch weapon without losing progress , player A and B leave fireteam go back to orbit and change equipment  , then join back with player C , then player C left and change equipment then join back either player A or B . You don't lost progress or point .
---
I've only run Levi, last wish and GoS.  Of those three last wish was without a doubt the hardest.  Immense communication required.  Levi was also sort of challenging but not as bad, I think.
---
Garden of Salvation felt really easy up until the final boss.  Honestly I've run that raid twice at this point but haven't been able to beat the boss due to time restrictions...
---
Fairly certain it's the revoker
---
Imagine getting farmed like this when your hacking
---
Wot?
---
Every night.

I never realized we have been slaying almonds
---
Free entertainment
---
How though??
---
It’s raw power
---
No sir. That’s what guardians do. We casually kill gods. You’re just a guardian doing guardian things. Keep on
---
New Light is free
---
Bounties, win streaks, and prior extra valor weeks probably play in to the equation and why you think it’s off somehow.
---
Those are the increments for each armor stat tier
---
Prolly someone who has just been oem aped one too many times
---
u will get the y1 campaigns for free, keep in mind u wont get any exotic during those, the base light level is 750, story progression is all over the place
---
Not a chance. Breakthrough spawns are locked, that’s why you see people kill farming and stat padding in it. It’s way too easy to spawn trap people.
---
I never had a teammate.

Im outta primary ammo! -Cap'n, in the midst of fighting Riven.

I am a sadist. I don't think I need to say more then that LOL
---
What kind of printer/ filament are you using? I am TRYING to get my ender-3 to print the Ace of Spades but it keeps pulling up on the edges.
---
Yah idk have you tried restarting the game? Might be a server issue or something
---
I don't get it
---
Yes.
---
I am also using an Ender 3. Warping can be a pain, it’s usually the result of a draft of cool-ish air hitting the build plate, or lack of proper distance between the nozzle and bed. I print with a brim basically 100% of the time because it’s faster than a raft and uses less material but basically guarantees warping isn’t going to happen
---
Because it locks equipment so you need communication before the strike begins.
---

---
Well, your Sunshot looks phenomenal! Congrats on an epic print
---
*cries in PC*
---
Thanks a bunch!!!! It took like a week to print it all out and then I really put off painting it

I have, no luck

Kono Dio Da!

Once its done, which im hoping will be while im out of school this week, ill be getting my AoS printed and painted to show off.

New light boosted everyone straight to 750 by giving you a bunch of blue gear at 750 power. You said yourself she played for a while before you so yeah it makes sense that she gained a few levels

When the edge transit gets a bit more edge then it should.

having some trouble with that

There are 3 know places with this text, in the first one a special yellow Knight will spawn, if you kill it nothing happens. The third one is for the Xenophage quest.

I do want this it looks so cool

He was taking it like a man, didn't even try to move with his connection.

Thanks for the help. I won't be wasting anymore time on modulus reports.

Just ballistic log frames, and only the first two you complete each week count.
---
As u/crankydyke said, it takes five weeks from scratch to get the ten frames needed.

And bone is more dense than muscle so by that logic you're a bony little freak. So absolutely not.

That's meeee! I don't know what the heck you're talking about!

This is the way

We ain’t called godslayers for nothin.

Nope, it’s just a random roll that can happen on any armor, usually rares, but won’t always apply to the rest of the set

Had 2 drop today while farming nightmares on the moon.

The only reason I can think of that you are lagging and it’s taking awhile for everyone to load in including the npcs

Which ones are you specifically missing?

still a problem for me and some of my friends. not stable. feel like its a temporary fix
---
Something with exploding rounds prob
---
Ummm I would suggest doing it in momentum but that’s gone. You can try the duke handcannon it has very high impact so it would help with headshots.
---
Thanks for the help it turns out I had a quest to do with him but it didn’t have the symbol so I was confused
---
Does this count towards Relics of the Golden Age?
---
Don't worry, it was *God*frey Jones.
---
It’s been proven that a expansion system is “easily” do able including graphical updates.  they could light level cap old exotics to make them USABLE in all game modes aside from the highest level content (due to the significant light disadvantage) to avoid having to use power creep for exotic weapons. I would gladly spend $60 a year if it meant they just keep adding in to destiny 2 and let me keep all of my stuff!

And before you try badmouthing Zavala anymore, have a look at [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/do7avu/humanity_is_totally_fucked_and_zavala_is_the_only/).
---
So would clappin cabal be the chubby chasers of the destiny universe?
---
I’m in the same boat amigo, Just came back to the week ago and bought forsaken.  While it (shadowkeep + incl season pass) may not be too worth it in the long run since this season only has like 15 days left, it will get you some nice upgrades. Next season pass is only $10. Season pass seems worth it to me.  I bought it when there was 25 days left and I got good bonuses
---
Forsaken will definently worth it as a lot of people are still running raids (leviathan) which I believe is locked behind forsaken. Shadowkeep is the newest expansion, and the content from it so far has been solid. 
---
If I was you, I’d probably buy them both.  They’re beyond worth it when they’re on sale
---
ayyy, i got 5
---
Right like the same can be said about other weapons as can be said about this looking at you Chaperone and dust rock but really it's not the guns fault people have an off day in crucible sometimes
---
That’s armor. Not an engram. You can’t get guns from NF
---
You have to play one more match after getting the rank needed. A simple google search would have told you that
---
nah man its fake
---
I don't wanna hear it, the hunter melee speed isn't as bad as Warlocks.
---
Quick question,
---
I have ShadowKeep and season of undying on PS4 and Forsaken + previous seasons on Xbox1. I have enable cross save between the two.
---
If I start a forsaken exotic quests like black armory items etc. on my Xbox and finish on my PS4 that is all good right? 
---
Just wondering if anybody else has tried this?
---
Cheers 🙌🏻
---
I see more Titans running shotties than hunters.
---
I need Mara wearing the mega milk shirt rn
---
So does everyone my light wielding friend
---
Thank you for the thoughtful response
---
Doing the strike or the strength in numbers part? The guardian kills with hand cannons can take pretty long
---
Time to order a commission
---
It's not about having a OHK melee ability. It's about having a OHK ability in general.
---
Theres a strike?!
---
Fusion rifles are dog shit for pvp and get beat by pretty much everything else. Except bad players
---
Lmao not the destiny post. I mean the cyber truck itself haha
---
On 1 Tree of 1 Subclass, and the only way to effectively use it is to give up an exotic slot, even then, it can still brick.
---
Not like Titans who have Skullfort, or Knockout, or Lightning Grenades, or any Shoulder Charging ability in general.
---
No its actually real, Elon Musk revealed it the other day as the next Tesla
---
GOD IS DEAD. AND YOU KILLED HIM.
---
Keep those eyes, and chin up Guardian!
---
He said this after I floored teabagging, Jade Rabbbit, Shotgun using FoH apes using Nova Warp lol (I has clip too :P) it just mad it funnier to me
---
It's the IX!
---
Yes
---
Happened to us once. He just took it like a bitch
---
Yeah, and FoH floored them one match lol even PUNCHED one out of his Super xD
---
Haha as a mostly solo player I know that feeling man, if you're on ps4 I'd happily help grind the quest out as it doesnt take too long.
---
I got two as random drops in single day
---
Gotta love that Sunshot there. Literally oven replacement.
---
The Vanguard would never let you eat an entire Scorn!
---
That’s the point though you can get easy kill camping. Throwing knives have no aim assist up to a foot in front of the target so even camping with it won’t guarantee you a kill. Go in and try it it’s hard af to even land a head shot throwing knife let alone landing one on someone at all who isn’t straight lining you.
---
Hive witches also count for this....its a risk taking that though
---
Rng should have never blessed me with the wardcliff coil
---
Good luck with that lol. It's an ultra rare drop from leviathan
---
Thats me .:/
---
Kill clip/threat detector isn’t a bad roll. Personally I like threat detector more than outlaw. And rampage doesn’t do as much as it use to it’s almost cut in half from like 60% to 33% damage increase.
---
I was aiming for a PVE spare rations
---
Play a hunter for a little bit and tell me our grenades aren't trash.
---
Didn’t see a single one until I gave the controller to my friend for 2 seconds and he got Thunderlord.
---
What about the duke 44 how do you like it?
---
Shax told me yesterday if he had 10 other hunters like me the frontier would be ours
---
Bows need a fully drawn shot, it's not immediate (this is an important thing to note. In too many games that allow releasing charged weapons early there *will* be people who will just spam the uncharged attack, even if it's absolute garbage that way.
---
It’s not that bad, know when you’re marked and used that against your opponent. People tend to crutch the match a bit too hard. I am one of the few hunter mains that uses foetracer, it’s actually quite overpowered tbh and a great counter, for you do not have to damage your opponent to mark them.
---
Oh man i need to 3d print a dreadfang
---
The fact you can get riskrunner as a world drop is very upsetting. Its like the easiest exotic quest ever
---
This must be an old meme being reposted, because it's impossible to go back to 0 unless you never ranked up from a win now...you only start dropping ranks at Fabled.

As with all things hunter, This is the way.
---
Yes but only until the end of the season. So make sure you finish the rest of the quest asap
---
Luckily Iron Banner will be available again in a few days. A win in Iron Banner gives you 5% progress!
---
See you stateside guardian. Would be a pleasure to have your light in my fireteam

And wait half a century to slap them again

Can you just get outbreak perfect as a random drop?

There is an op hunter melee build like this as well.  Top tree arc, liars handshake, one two punch, tractor cannon, thundercoil, and unstoppable melee for the ogres. I do everything with it and recently won a gambit round with 93% primeval damage with it. Your also able to one tap unstoppable ogres and barrier knights if you have liars proc’d.
---
Ty, fixed.
---
It fires transmats
---
Because that's how you get LH/NF?
---
74 range, 68 stability and 92 handling with the catalyst. And 12 rounds in the mag. 
---
It’s a monster that people really sleep on.
---
Don't worry it's a normal mistake. Hive are born being thrall, and then they can either choose to become male (knights) or female (wizards).
---
There are a few exceptions tho. Like Nokris being male or Xivu Arath being female
---
Hunter squad
---
I don't think so. I really did that !

Maybe my incouscious told me the reference.

No I mean that it's the overwhelming meta.  I just wish people liked to shake it up a bit more.

no

According to the crucible, he’s probably loves you as much as his helmet
---
You don’t control whether the overlord spawns or not so you aren’t making it “heroic”
---
The new Activity on the Moon or vex offensive. Every useless legendary drop can be dismantled for 4/5 ls.
---
Yoooo. Aetheon.?
---
and there aint any other way to enter infinite forrest except flashpoint mission? because i did s trike and there were only a handful of fallen. maybe 10 max. this cant be real.
---
this actually happened to me when i first started playing earlier this month. like someone actually showed me about events and how they work and what material nodes look like.
---
It doesn’t, if you killed no hydras the overlord would’ve still spawned those times. It’s a myth that killing the hydras guarantees an overlord.
---
Im on PS4 sadly but I would easily recommebd Forsaken then Shadowkeep. Forsaken is probably the best DLC with TTK a close second.
---
the people who started the game after it became partly F2P
---
He gave me permission. Don't Worry, He's a friend xD

Working on a thicc version ;) i hope it will be good!

Outbreak without a doubt

The leviathan has 3 encounter before you get to the throne room; gauntlet, Gardens, baths. When you complete one of those rooms, you get a key that opens a chest in the underbelly. So each time you do a full raid, you get 3 keys. You can check for the keys in your inventory. 
---
Those keys are used for specific chests in the underbelly. Example, if you have an irrigation key, you can use it to open the chest in irrigation. You can look for a map in Google to help find your way around.

I somehow had 4 drop just yesterday in the one day for me after none for about a week, 2 masks of the quiet one, a kephris horn and an insurmountable skullfort.
---
Here we come no exotics for another week
---
I thought I got one, but then it was just an exotic quest
---
Also don’t ask Eris about a certain rock.  She’ll get sad
---
Deathbringer, Leviathan's breath, did you complete Eris' weekly bounty?
---
Just in case? Like what if there is some thrall for real?

If first encounter was hostile maybe? Space wars? Or maybe they just want guns cause everyone else has them.

If I read the article I could tell you.

Always

Quests, raids, nightfall, crucible, nightmare hunts, work on titles.

Ooh, maybe a variant on the sparrow racing, but a kind of Mad Max version where you can "temporarily disable" guardians with enough damage.

Well shit I’m still a Virgin
---
All hail the hunters
---
not to mention that dumbass melee ability looks menacing as fuck (and i think if used with an exotic to enhance it should make it a OHK but bungie would neber) like a big wave of fueling electricity. but in reality it’s a flow of marshmallows that decide to never hit your target and just slide right past them.

I'm glad you like it, but it's still a shitty gun.

It'll probably be buffed soon, so hold onto it, but for now, it's incredibly bad.

It’s still very powerful with top tree Arcstrider+a One Two Punch shotgun, it’s just not as powerful as before the nerf

You have Black Armory. Go talk to the Black Armory NPC in the Tower, Ada-1.

If you are wondering how people know to use the survival playlists, it is because they say on them that they give glory when you hover over them. The other crucible playlists say they give valor, which is a separate system.

There is 61

Just to expand for anyone reading who's not familiar with the gun: It's now a two-shot where the second bullet does most of the damage. Of course it creates void explosions with little nova-bomb style void bombs. The little detail that makes it stand out is enemies get a zero-grav push-back as they explode which can make it easier to set off a chain if separated enemies are getting pushed towards each other and exploding.
---
The catalyst increases the range and target acquisition so you get stickier headshots
---
That’s what they get for spilling tardigrades
---
Ok thanks. I’m not sure why the Destiny app shows 55 exotic weapons.
---
right the preson who did is stupid and i bet it a female teenager
---
He’s just proud he got it and wanted to share
---
Im gonna trow up
---
Spare Rations and Beloved is my go-to for pvp rn
---
Can't be angry if they're dead...
---
KD ≤1 = More Punchy
---
I thought the drum looked more like a strawberry
---
I think it's meant to be the shape of the eyes, which is different through different "races" of humanity. The facial structure of an African-American Woman is in fact different to an Australian Woman for example
---
what part? There's a Guardian in Daytona.
---
Meme videos, I watch them too whenever I'm bored lol
---
r/transmatfiring
---
From what I can gather, he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial land ship just outside of Rubicon

I figured that.  The original creator is an idiot, but for the joke you're making it's perfect.  Haha
---
Kill clip and ricochet rounds daaamn
---
He called a Stormcaller "God himself"
---
I'm not sure if they're an idiot. I mean different "races" do have different facial (and eye) structure. I don't think it's *fully* based around the eye colour. If that was their intention though, then yeah they aren't too clever
---
I play this game for 1,5 years already, and have never found an exotic engram
---
Turn on Incognito and search it up to your hearts content. For scientific research obviously.
---
That he is a she
---
except along US60 in Phoenix... try 6 lanes in 6 directions... with a few having railroad tracks in them
---
Thank you, I'm pretty sure I tried this but I will give it another try when I get online again
---
Gonna need an explanation video
---
i have a powershell command which pods me into matchmade instances solo
---
YOUR ENEMY CANT KILL IF THEIR DEAD HAHA
---
Never mind the sticker, what in the fuck is that intersection
---
Lol, another one. They should nerf nerfing
---
Im am extremely unlucky, havent found a single exotic engram in the 1,5 years that i have played
---
If hunters drive semis, what do titan's drive?
---
I know, still not game breaking. Wow you can solo 2 bosses... Its going to get fixed, but surely not disabled
---
Which ornament? The chest and class item are all that’s left.
---
What's that auto rifle?
---
Nah, I'm on PC. Probably gonna buy shadowkeel soon as the next season starts
---
Havent seen one in the 1,5 years that i played
---
Orlando

I am at the point where I'm having a hard figuring out what is what, as well as stuff that isnt available to me without paying for dlc
---
Lmfao it’s fucked
---
Thanks that was what I was wondering. Didnt phrase it that well lmaooo
---
I mean basically soloing raid bosses with one shot is kinda broken don't you think
---
Yes, really.  
---
The "Courts" would argue that once the attacker no longer had the knife he wasn't a threat, and that the stabbed victim could run. (While bleeding, possibly to death mind you.)  
---
Honestly it sickens me, that a first world country denies self defense as a personal inalienable right.
---
100 discipline + contraverse hold. This is the only reason I use this subclass, the super is pretty bad imo.
---
It appears you are asking a question about LFG/Clans, or help in-game. 
---
Please post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/bzjpkr/official_lfg_megathread_v_4/) instead, look at the LFG dropdown menu on the top bar of the subreddit for various LFG resources, or check the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/bvr9ex/official_faq_please_read_before_posting/?) for possibly helpful advice on how to find people to play with our advertise/find clans.
---
Absolutely wrecked the 980 nightfall yesterday with two other hunters. I've never felt more happy about my main class. Everyone was friendly and cutting up the whole time.  
---
  
---
-edit: might have been the 950. idk. got 100k, don't care.
---
Has the US not heard of roundabouts?
---
Wait so only year 2 seals count for the achievement? That includes Dredgen right?
---
Fuckimg hunter
---
Or six pieces of duck tape
---
Your a good titan, I picture you as the forefront in any team comp, with St. 14 helmet and a bubble at the ready.
---
Am new light. Can confirm I have no idea what's happening 60% of the time still and I got my mian above 920
---
well maybe if you've chosen a  viable weapon in the kinetic slot you could've complete it in time.
---
I'll swim and sail on savage seas with never a fear of drowning
---
Loving the reference guardian
---
Saw the pic and immediately said “Florida”. Went there over the summer and they were everywhere
---
Someone explain why this became copypasta
---
Also, I’m in eastern America timezone
---
"What I mean to say... is that her brother was a goon. 
---
But she was once my Crimson Bond. 
---
On that day she asked me to read to her. 
---
I told her, 'No one tells me what to do,' and I recited the Tempest from memory - all five acts.
---
She didn't blink.
---
I think she was trying to put me off..."
---
It's still not. The build up time and the active time are too disproportionate. And it's exotic.
---
What about equipping them?
---
Orlando? Definitely get an orlando vibe

Do you know what clutch means? Location doesn't mean anything, context does, when and how
---
Okay, i think need to watch a breakdown of that or something to get a better understanding, but thanks!
---
I don’t want to crap on your idea, but can’t you see how  that wouldn’t help either? Unlock the breaker, team wipe, spawns flip because team a is inside of team b area, game over. It’s just not a game mode designed for any sort of real competitive play.
---
Yup lol
---
One of my personal favorites.
---
I actually find it hard to use the reflector arcstrider, considering that it runs out too quickly and doesn't have a use case asides getting pummeled at the right time.
---
I approve of this message.
---
Honestly, I blame Bungo gutting all the other trash clearing perks besides MOA.  I don't think Recluse is OP, I just think other things are ineffective.  I'm top 2% in comp on PC and I think OEM is borderline useless.  It's extremely easy to play around.  The info it gives is pretty vague, it shows direction and that's about it.
---
This sub is turning into r/funny except it isn't funny after the 20th repost..
---
Recently graduated from UCF so i had a feeling that was nearby
---
Cool sword design. Maybe bungie will create something like it
---
once you get it, it’s all you will ever get. Are you ready to accept that burden
---
Yep
---
shit ok
---
That's just you though
---
Now that is a bad team
---
Tampa Guardian here. I saw the top comment and thought "What's wrong with them they're just streetlights?"
---
Bottom of character menu
---
Never beg for free art. Unless the quality you want is a kindergarten doodle.
---
Sauce?
---
Nice!
---
Finally some quality content
---
I don’t get this
---

---
*warlock
---
Lol yea the outbreak is def the most viable weapon if you aren’t running Izanagi’s Burden like literally everyone else
---
Watch it full so h know what the video is about
---
Utah is very similar, love the grid system!
---
Randys throwing knife
---
I did. He stood his ground and baited you out.
---
Tap the trigger Under Pressure projection fuse range Masterwork is the god roll for me at least if you could get under pressure backup plan with a range Masterwork that would be probably the best for PVP
---
When i was pretty much doing better at the game it disconected me , thats what the video was about
---
I guess they increased the drop rate for 1 day few days ago coz I got 4 exotics and 2 catalysts in 1 day only from vanguard and nightfall ordeal strikes but got nothing after that day.
---
I’m going to say this, and I don’t want you to think that I’m saying this to bullshit you or make you feel bad. 
---
I get about 25 new exotics each week. They always have 59-69 stat points. This week, I took off from the exotic grind, as the nightfall is bad (and I already have 10 complete sets of masterworked PVE and PvP armor across my account.
---
But next week if you take the grind seriously, and run the nightfall master 100 to 150 times, you will receive over 150 prisms, 30 ascendant shards, 30 to 40 exotics. 
---
I believe next week should be the inverse spire, don’t skip any champions, skip the battleground, take out the sniper on the left first there though, let the wanted move ahead and escape from you, fight the champions in the drill area one at a time as a group- middle bottom top,try to get the boss done in 1 phase (don’t use divinity).
---
thank you!
---
No. I think that will happen more with Drifter since hes the bridge between the Light and Dark
---
That didn't show up.
---
Its 3 minutes , are you sure you watched it?
---
Most people agree it’s likely 70, but I’ve never seen over 68 so I think he probably does have a mod on it along with the MW. Though it is possible he got a 70 which is why id like a pic.
---
Your welcome, glad you finished that part out.
---
I haven’t heard it! Mind linking it? (Just the lore not the porn lol)
---
Bons brothers - fuck that night fall and their splash - or was it the other shitty strike with the 3 flaers at the end - it was like a fake night fall too if I recall correctly because I dont think any of the 3 psion could drop an exotic or would take your 3 of coin
---
The badge
---
The great disaster bois
---
this isn't really something new, you can get both chests with every character solo
---
I never said it was the *most* viable weapon
---
Really?  I see way more Lunas than anything else nowadays on ps4
---
I kill the last 2 guys on that round , the next round i kill 2 guys and when i move towards the third one it disconected me
---
I believe they said they might bring stuff back later, but it won't be the \*exact next season\*, maybe a few seasons later or so
---
Iv been having this Same issue .
---
thank you for correcting me. now do you know what do I need to do? =)
---
Oh okay, im excited to get it then. Im re buying the game for PC and im so excited!
---
*gregs
---
Oh dear. The other day in the LFG discord I joined a room for a Scourge run. One of the players (female) said she was leaving a spot open for her boyfriend and all the other 4 dudes left... the thirst was fucking real and cringe.
---
Complete the badge for season of undying
---
Bruh
---
I just dont see myself getting to 9th branch with a primary (given my teammates) and that pinnacle is the only thing I'm really chasing at this point.  Guess I'm just ignorant to other peoples' objectives
---
No, I literally mean the collections badge. In the collections tab, there are a few badges in the bottom right, find the season of the undying one. And then complete that
---
Misfits and Ten Paces!
---
Dayum, the drop chance must be really low then. I even got exotics from Rahool while looking for it :/
---
Lol I follow hunting sub too and was so confused what brand of hunting clothing this was. Looks Kind of like mountain ops
