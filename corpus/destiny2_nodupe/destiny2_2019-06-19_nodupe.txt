Everyone has to deal with it though, just accept that someone else is having fun pressing a button. Let them eat cake, respawn. If it’s golden gun then tip your hat, because it’s a woman/man of culture.

I think you do need the forsaken DLC, the annual pass only give extra content that only can be accessed if you have the DLC.
---
How you access it sucks too tho...
---
How do I get the blue ones?
---
I understand it can go both ways, I have people I play with who absolutely love PvP, and your reasoning is completely understandable, I'm not shitting on PvP players at all, I'm just saying as a primarily PvE player having crucible in my quest objectives is really frustrating, and I'll openly admit that I'm bad at crucible. For the last part that is absolutely true, I struggled to get Thorn but did it just because I love it's design.

Why have you cursed me with this knowledge.

Imo there should be a hotfix to that gun this is worse than the laser show back with polaris

Guess you like black Armory gear (hunter)

Use "request desktop site" to use full quality images.

I just started actually it’s pretty fun probably best to get caught up and see if you wanna keep playing the new expansion

I was confused as hell about everyone freaking out about it till I saw some pc gameplay...holy shit

You put my child down THIS INSTANT!!

After like 5 times its like its always been there, for me at least...

I've seen like 3 of them in the past 2 weeks. I think Bungie screwed something up.

Fair enough haha

You gotta unlock the armor first, it literally says it in the update

L M N LoW Q R S... I dont get it?

Legit took me a bit on this one.
---
No. It won't.  This has heen a thing since d1. Stop being a subhuman liar dude. Bungie even confirmed in d1 that they dont care

Still not liking the horns on the helmets

Someone told me those expacks were free with the plus version

Who's cutting onions?

just got jotunn 2 days ago finally also had a fighting lion drop forget where

Well that’s neat, what’s your set up :)
---
I have great PvP stats but I still don’t like PvP
---
So basically the same with the Destiny 1 mission added in? Why add it in then?
---
The best thing was when you did bubbles on bubbles in crucible with every one running skorri.

I tried to missile myself down. I failed.

What a wonderful thing to complain about when the game has no other problems.

The Drifter/Vanguard quest progression seems to be glitchec currently just FYI

Which is exactly why it shouldn't be so goddamn over powered. The community bitches about LoW but Recluse is the fucking problem imo.

Last I was getting these fuckers like once/twice a week. Opulence dropped and I haven’t gotten one since. I think they have drop protection so the more you play the more you get, and I played A LOT last season, had a lot of catching up to do since I hadn’t played since October Y1

I think it’s the injection rig

It is no different then any other 150 other then a “precision frame” HC that has a unique perk which rewards hitting your third shot in the body and not head. Doesn’t sound like a precision HC to me.
---
Bungie over swung. Pick a nerf 150 or mag howl, not both.
---
Point in case the rise of 140 Austringer. Which is farmable to anyone. Has near perfect recoil pattern, random rolls, and perks that outplay mag howl.
---
The highest pinnacle weapon in most opinion based off the requirement has essentially been turned into a trophy. After spending literally days of time in comp only to turn around and grind a Service Revolver or Austringer which has better use is a little nonsense.
---
I love the gun, I still use it often in comp, but it is by no means a top tier pinnacle weapon any longer.
---
It seemed like I got way more medals when I didn't need them lmao
---
Again, doesn’t work
---
Also I’m sure at the 5500 mark there are full teams of quad peregrine Titans going arou-no it’s just stompee hunters
---
Twitter if I’m not mistaken.
---
Nope, as long as you used approved software like razer, corsair, or Logitech gaming software
---
You have the option to not ape your way into its range though.
---
No..

Saladin quoted  u/trailmixjesus
---
What’s his secondary here??? I see everyone using it but can’t find out the name :(
---
Toxic
---
Say you're 700 light overall and the enemy is 700, you will do normal damage. It doesn't matter if your weapon is 650 or 750, your overall light is the number that is being put up against the enemies not the specific weapon being shot at them.
---
That would work if d2 had long range maps and if this thing didn't 2 burst at basically any range
---
Rogan strikes again ;)
---
Oh damn, the Salad Man has his work cut out..
---
Dang I thought taken king was amazing compared to the past dlc’s
---
You guys are getting exotics?
---
Expires September 09 2018.
---
Rogan?
---
It's meant to be, go be an ape guardian.
---
What? Why is lord of wolves a bad thing? I'm confused? It's working exactly how it's intended to be working?
---
Why would they git gud when they can complain until it gets nerfed into "uselessness" and they can go back to being apes?
---
Generally it’s the LoW aping into range of me, not the other way around. TTK is so high they usually have time to get within range before I can kill them.
---
Like the shooting feels so good I don’t know how to explain it. It’s just really fun shooting aliens in the fucking face
---
zavala. been standing next to him with his dialog just happening.
---
The issue is just the damage and range being too high. It will kill at 44m with body shots in an empowering rift. 
---
Obviously not a real game situation but still.
---
It will also 1 burst supers.
---
The gun just does too much dmg, in a LoW vs LoW fight, someone does within milliseconds and it is whoever prefired because of the radar
---
Like, if people want useless fucking weapons they should go back to D1, because they already ruined it.
---
Someone who watches this post what he says please no offense but I have no time to watch the 10 minute video for 3 seconds of information one that's probably going to amount to win the game
---
Hey i got that engram too! All i got is a cayde keychain and sundance keychain from gamestop at the moment. Plan on filling up a shelf or two with Cayde stuff when i get the chance. Working on a Cayde cosplay first though.
---
True
---
I believe you're looking for hard light, a exotic auto rife.
---
Aha! I knew it was one of the Titans! It's just unfortunate that I wasn't correct
---
Only time I'm good in pvp is...
---
My best guess is probably hard light
---
The pre-nerf Last Word or Ace?
---
The original picture is from Joe Rogan's podcast studio! My bad haha
---
Ohh right, I'm not familiar with that unfortunately aha, still a great crossover nonetheless.
---
If it was account wise, you would only get the reward once instead of 3 times.
---
How long did you take to get a seal, I play on and off and I'm just now considering going for the challenges in the new one but I never play one thing for more than one week so I'm trying to dedicate but you know lol
---
It complete honesty what doesn't work about a OHK melee to any super?
---
No but you def saw quads of OEM, St0mp-EE5 is a neutral exotic. Doesn't grant health or shield or wall hacks.
---
Guarantee once the grieves live long enough in the loot pool you will see more.
---
For better context.
---
What site are you on to view stats like that?
---
O it’s actually a glitch? Damn.. F. And I missed that so thanks for letting me know.
---
Awesome! I've wanted to get into cosplay for a long time. I made that ace of spades out of foam as the beginning of my cosplay but I lost steam because of the huge amount of work it took! Good luck on your future cosplay work :D
---
Wrong.
---
You are hedging a lot on people wanting to watch this garbage
---
Yeah except it's buff is attained from every other weapon. Give me *one* good reason an easy to acquire primary slot legendary should be better than an exotic special.
---
Hard Light maybe?
---
Oh it is my favorite thing to hunt people who bag me and just make their lives miserable in gambit. Then afterwards when they whisper you just to say some nasty things oh man the salt is refreshing at times.
---
If you successfully complete 6, you move on to the boss level 7. If you fail at level 6 and quickly restart, you go back to level 5.
---
Im not a fan of pve when its nothing but tracer shanks and wire rifles either...
---
I'm on Xbox and no one is using it.
---
Hard light. It can also change ammo types like borealis.
---
The difference is kb/m. There are players that have adapters that let them use kb/m and they steamroll people like on PC.
---
Pursuits tab indeed bad.
---
Polaris. I have 75 Army of Ones with Polaris alone and I got Dredgen back in October of 2018 haha.
---
I've played plenty against it, and you can counter it. Problem is for the one asshat you outmaneuver, 2-3 more shit on you.
---
Decent,
---
Thanks
---
I want you to imagine using a Kill Clip weapon. Enhances the weapon beyond it’s normal capability, right? Now imagine being able to proc the buff whenever you want without a kill AND it lasts indefinitely. That’s what Lord of Wolves’ Release the Wolves perk is. 
---
The ammo issue your presented is easily solved by using two shotgun scavengers on your gauntlet and boots; I believe you get 30 rounds with every pickup? That’s 3 (almost) guaranteed kills. If you’re gonna say at least ONE of those people didn’t have special to drop, then you’d be lying. 
---
The Release the Wolves perk is broken right now, Melts everything and ALMOST IS a heavy weapon when killing supers. The gun itself isn’t overpowered, the perk just needs a rework.
---
who would win  
---
Not forgotten 4 stack  
---
\#OR  
---
One Wolfy boi
---
Borealis isn't trash, just doesn't fit in with the meta. And what I'm saying is the community is complaining about an exotic special because it can kill supers at 20+ meters... whilst having no problem with the easy to acquire SMG with a ttk twice as fast as most other weapons in the game..
---

Yes. My first 2 weapon drops were

Best post i’ve seen on this sub in months. Thank you from the bottom of Riven’s heart.
---
Cheers man, shame cos I really love the Night Watch/Riskrunner combo (generally just really like Riskrunner since I got it last night!) but deep down I know Polaris is better to invade/kill invaders with.
---
I found myself in 5 consecutive matches that went to mercy. Matchmaking is OP.
---
Everything’s out opulence has been great except for this...
---
See here's the difference, to get that fast of a TTK on the recluse you need to get kills before hand, the perk requires you to actually do something to proc it
---
I use riskrunner when I'm on my Titan middle tree Striker with skullfort and Hands-On. Infinite Soopers and resilience.
---
Suros regime
---
Should've ended the clip on the landing
---
Thank you very much!
---
Its a 2 minute video.Says since the old Iron Banner tokens are now pointless you can turn them in for new tokens
---
But the imperials.
---
Hold on, I thought LoW meant you held reload after a kill to get the perk. You're saying that you can proc it from the get go? Ok, that's pretty fucking broken actually.
---
There are other differences though. Bloom and stability is much higher on PC. That's something that you can't change with an adapter
---
I never get exotic drops. Like literally never.
---
Don't think I have that yet, been a Sunbreaker till now and only just started messing around with Striker. How do I get it?
---
*your
---
Pls sauce
---
Damn. I honestly thought you had to actually get a kill with it beforehand to proc release the wolves. That's pretty stupid imo, should be changed to at least make it so you need to kill something.
---
It can? I really need to look at my exotic perks
---
It seems like yes for my hunter, cant determine if its account wide or not yet.
---
YES! after the recent update you can hold reload, and release the wolves will proc
---
Random or Xur
---
Did you have a friend use their sparrow as a ramp?
---
You get 150 per bounty so it’s no biggie. The 500 is from the Triumph.
---
Then that's 450 on all three characters plus the 500.
---
The other person in the strike was at the blind well. So it loaded you into the same area.
---
If you spawned in on someone they were likely grinding for the wendigo. No glitch, you can start blind well from inside of nightfalls too.
---
It’s a difference of 300 Imperials which almost means nothing given that you could get more than that per Menagerie run when you’re farming the chest.
---
He keeps insulting Hive, saying how Sword Logic is flawed and that the Hive should just kill themselves since they always lose to the Gaurdians, yet he's unable to control any Hive, and none of the Cabal can really defeat any Hive God. Also, Savathûn seems to out rank him imo with her cunning ability. He thinks he discovered her plan by having Gahlran wear the Crown of Sorrow, yet I feel Savathûn knew Calus wouldn't wear it himself, so she used it to get a better understanding of the Calus' loyalists and the Guardians, as she can control and see through Gahlran. 
---
Let's also not forget, Xivû Arath has claimed the universe to be her court. Every being that fights, regardless if they win or lose, if they believe in Sword Logic or not, feeds her worm. She should theoretically be stronger than the Darkness, as the battle between Light vs Dark feeds her as well technically.  If Bungie doesn't make her fight right, I'm gonna be thoroughly pissed.
---
When he said he can kill Mara and turn her and her Awoken/Techeuns into neck jewelry, I was just shocked. Hell no, don't touch Mara.
---
If you use those weapons enough yea it’s def worth it to pick up.  
---
The special / heavy ammo “finders” were sorta bugged with pve activities. 
---
The scavengers will always work tho.
---
H o w
---
I mean technically Oryx is alive cuz he lives on with his Ravenous Heart in Touch of Malice (hopefully Eris has the gun, and it didn't break in the Cabal attack on the Tower).
---
Yea but atleast recluse you need a kill to proc and you’re on a 5 sec timer.  
---
RTW you have it anytime u need.
---
It’s a great nerf
---
What console you play on? I really want to run some D1 raids again, but never find anyone to run with. Clanmates also don't have D1 installed anymore :(
---
Correct
---
I like the combo of both. 
---
Depending on maps.  
---
I’ve been sniping lately and run recluse in second spot. 
---
If i get a snipe the timer is on to rush and see what I can do. 
---
Each method holds a special place in my heart. 
---
There’s nothing like headshotting someone out of a super and then being able to flank and take out 1-2 more.
---
Quality shitpost
---
Shoulda just waited for your weekly bonus my friend
---
are you playing on console?
---
I'm making my way to Recluse, you can join me if you want
---
Hi making my way to recluse, you can join me if you want, I'm dad.
---
If they are, I fucking applaud them
---
Hahaha..... Damn I been using this after 2 days of the new pursuits tab!! But seriously Bungie you guys better add keybind soon
---
It's one of this week's Werner 99-40 bounties. Should be able to track it under Pursuits.
---
Fully admit to hating PVP because I'm at best "mediocre". That said, I'm almost done with the quests to get the exotics, working on Chaperon now, and then I can take a break.
---
I do like Iron Banner, though, mostly because I don't feel so overwhelmed by how terrible I play, mainly because it seems like a lot more average people play during this week than any other. 
---
My husband was actually playing with me last week to do the weekly Clan bounty (and the ones for the Trials by Combat) and said I was getting much better. I can usually get above a 1.0 efficiency rating now, instead of averaging a sub-.25, and that's while also playing with my kiddos and keeping them from screaming (which often involves climbing on me and sending out random grenades lol).
---
Ok I must have misread the bounty
---
Amazing with fighting lion.
---
Its just 99 drang kills
---
Without dying
---
Finding and shooting all of those gives you an Exotic Sword at 30 and an Exotic Sparrow at all 45 White = any weapon 
---
Orange = Solar
---
Purple = Void
---
Blue = Arc
---
Red = Valkyrie Spear (Which you can get from Escalation Protocol or Warsat public events, and there's one node in each of the fast travel points that requires the spear, on a pipe in the Braytech Futurescape in between the Warsat and Injection Rig locations and the other on top of a lone tree in the Glacial Drift just before where the Warsat lands)
---
There are videos detailing where to find them all, and you get items that occasionally give lore related to a Destiny 1 character known as The Exo Stranger, who is actually... SPOILERS AHEAD
---
Ana Bray's sister, Elsie
---
r/Fireteams or use our Discord. Link in sidebar.
---
Which is easy in pve
---
Bread makes you fat?!
---
 It counts as progress towards a quest.
---
Basically my friend blaming our teammates or thinking the enemy team is cheating when he over extends or stays out in to open for too long.
---
What gun is scar?
---
Hooooorrrnnnss!!!!
---
Well if I can't change your mind then why should I try? lol
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
In any case, I think the question should be "Is their internal playtesting of crucible changes effective?" judging by your premise, I'm guessing the answer to that is a resounding "no" lol
---
This can only be a complaint if it literally never filled up your team during the match. What do you expect anyone to do if you match with a 5 stack and they all leave?
---
You aught to see it on console with the damn aim assist
---
Hilarious seeing people on the forums saying “it’s not op”
---
Inspect them and see they’re on PlayStation or Xbox.
---
Morons.
---
We don’t really know much about the ‘season pass at the moment’
---
The soft cap is at 500 bud. The power surge quests that give you 690 gear kick you up a bit, but it’s all powerful gear from there.
---
Removing random rolls on weps is a bad idea. Base destiny 2 didn’t fair well with static weapons. People need something to grind for. god rolls are that carrot on a stick ya know ?
---
You guys are forgetting Graviton Lance with MW. That shit wreaks. I keep getting doubles and triples with it.
---
I don’t think Iron burden is a thing anynore
---
All arc stider trees have there uses but bottom tree with frostees in pvp is so good
---
Fixed Odds, the Menagerie LMG. Hammerhead is probably still better, but this one's fun to use.
---
I've been saving up clips of me hitting shots I have no business hitting
---
Um dude, you said that you are comparing raid exotics, so yeah comparing heavy weapons to an energy SMG, smh.
---
My Jotunn is literally the only reason I keep above k/d 1.0, shoot two, get one kill if I'm lucky, die, repeat
---
Wait for his week to come around
---
I don't really know for sure but there is a rotation with these bosses. If the new one is the last in the rotation then you have to wait through this and next week
---
Raid exotics in their originality. 
---
I’m comparing two smgs for damage. smh smh smh
---
diminishing returns if you actual equip 5 grenade mods, 3 is the max effect at work, any more and it'd be useless.
---
Yeah for real, who's he think he is? I'll happily side with anyone that's even vaguely sympathetic and he doesn't even make that list at all because he *isn't.* Calus just plays into greed. Hell, I'd side with the Drifter before him because at least I now know who the Drifter actually is even if I dislike him. Hell I'd side with goddamn Savathûn before him if she somehow decided to play the "enemy of my enemy" game. Calus? Nah. He's a massive dishonest coward.
---
/r/Destiny2 is a fan sub. No bungie employees will read this. Take matters like this over to /r/DestinyTheGame
---
is this in german? thats so bizarre to hear.
---
THIS IS AMAZING
---
well done OP :)
---
So how gear leveling works is like this :  
---
You have a  **Soft Cap** and a  **Hard Cap**.  
---
**Soft cap :**  
---
This is usually around 60 levels Lower than the **Hard Cap** where **ANY** items you find will be better , till you reach the  **Soft Cap (**currently 690).  
---
**Hard Cap :**   
---
ATM its 750.  in order to get better gear post 690 , you need to do what are called milestones and bounties that reward **Powerful Engram** (purple with orange centre) . These drop gear relatively higher than you highest possible average.   
---
How this is calculated is :  
---
  Lets say you have  all your gear 700 . The drop from the Powerfull engram will 100% be better level gear.   
---
**BUT** if you have a helmet 720, gloves 695,  chest 700 ..etc  (mixed level equipment)  you can get gloves that are 710 but you can also get Helmet thats 720 . This is it calculates the average level but makes sure that the level of the item you get is **NOT** lower than your current highest.  The items used to calculate this dont need to be equiped or even on the character.   
---
P.S Prime engrams are engrams you randomly get from killing mobs that also have the same effect of Powerful Engrams.   
---
P.P.S :   Exotic engrams (yellow) always give better level items, and substantially so.
---
uh, pretty sure he's saying nobody gives a shit because you were actively taking an enormous dump on Op's huge achievement in getting Dredgen. Just wanted to make that clear
---
lord of wolves
---
U get stability after dodging (also I am kin to believe that there is also a hidden unflinshing perk). It is most useful with handcannons and snipers but I've been trying other weapons and is not bad
---
But now he’s simultaneously equipping Recluse and LoW!! Literally unplayable /s
---
Tired meme bad.
---
They have a low drop rate, but the more you do it and dont get a weapon, the better the chances are next time, and reset on acquisition.
---
Now we sip champagne when we thirsty
---
Destroy it with the element of the colour of the sign. its lore + secret sparrow (think exotic sword too). 48 in total.
---
Thank you very much sir this helps alot !
---
Perfect , thank you
---
No prob. Once you do all the powerul engrams,  killing enemies still drops prime engrams so you can still "farm" better gear.
---
F
---
Surrounded spec ? Did they introduce a whole bunch of new specs and mods recently , I don’t remember seeing any of these when I started
---
In my clan we agreed on having a common time based on reset, like "let’s raid at reset +2", si ce reset happens at the same time everywhere, it doesn’t mess up with timezones
---
wow.... youa re REALLY unlucky and also uninformed.  
---
1. Look for XUR every wkend as he sells exotics and an engram that gurantees an un owned exotic.  
---
2. some exotics you get from quests, look them up .
---
Nah I'm just not smart enough to figure it out myself
---
Dude there’s nothing wrong with that. I’m a competitive person, I can’t play PvE on any game really. People have preferences. This post is for the irrationally angry 12 year olds messaging me what a piece of shit I am and how bad destiny is, etc.
---
original content like this is a breath of fresh air
---
*a Crash Tag Team Racing style game
---
FIFY
---
The new blue shell
---
yea soon
---
So if I have foresaken on both my PlayStation and my pc when cross save comes out and let’s say I want to play with my PlayStation characters on pc will I still have foresaken because I’ve bought it on pc?
---
I still prefer Crash Tag Team, but I know most people know nothing about it.
---
That, and exploring the park between races got weird sometimes.
---
My wife's text notification sound is the old ghallerhorn sparrow horn....but bungie listen to our feedback.... cadence horn anyone...duck quack was hilarious
---
I play on Xbox and I'd say it's just you. I'm wrecking people. I am max power but if what you are saying was true I'd be dying alot and that's just not happening.
---
through a larger version of the gauntlet?
---
Yeah I haven't had actual raiding friends since d1.... it's always randoms. Makes me kinda sad
---
I love the human randomness element. I KNOW people will memorize spawns and routes (I do it too) to try and get any advantage so simply deciding, “hey, I’m gonna go this way instead” or “I’m just going to run away from this gunfight back to my teammates” can really turn the tide of a game because it simply throws off the meta
---
Or or or-
---
The DRIVER uses Thundercrash, rocketing towards the finish line at great risk of exploding.
---
This would be so much fun ! I'd be happy with some sparrow racing League though. That was a good time.
---
Nope. just talk to benedict
---
I don’t like using super mods, it feels cheap. I’d rather use perks like “Pump Action” “Remote Connection” or “Hands On” so the extra super energy I gain feels like an actual reward
---
If they maintain and keep expanding D2 instead of switching to D3, there's definitely going to be room for SRL to come back and see more popularity.
---
Part of why SRL did poorly is that there simply weren't a ton of players at the time.
---
I think so, from bungie website, but i think its gonna cost you more than if you had bought them together
---
Think it’s when you complete a phase or what would be a rotation in raid. Like when you finish containing all the souls in arcborn or kill a knight in the riposte. I’m fairly certain it just means the next phase of enemies are spawning. Not sure though
---
Yeah and I use an iPhone 6. I’m not sure, might have to look it up online for your device specifically.
---
Its reassuring to hear that the bug can be fixed, i was starting to lose hope
---
Normally there's a fairly diverse meta of weapons to use in pvp, but lately Lord of Wolves is absolutely broken. Hopefully it gets fixed soon.
---
I don’t intend to use it i was hoping the devs banned it myself ..but no it’s not a cheat or hack nor exploit bud
---
At work so cant look. How will this look on 3440x1440?
---
I do both, and i managed to get some nice grenade focused enhanced perks from the menagerie. Its non stop handhelds.
---
I think i reset all of my destiny settings to default, uninstalled the game and reinstalled the game and it worked after that just fine. But I am pretty sure I tried a million things so it could have been any of them that fixed it.
---
Wow I have the stag helmet I never knew the ornament was so bad ass
---
I just want to be able to have all sparrows make the sound of the first sparrow you got when boosting, I just want that “buuuuuuuuweeeeeeaaaaa” sound back
---
Titan gang
---
As a member of the BO4 community I thought it was fucking hilarious that people were saying Bungie sucked and that’s why Acti left them, and now we’re seeing D2 better than ever and Bungie doing just fine without them.
---
Haters will be haters though, people will continue to call this game complete and utter shit without ever actually playing it
---
I didn't use Iphone let me download and check.
---
America with a mainly UK clan.
---
I have tried resetting the settings. But i reinstalled the whole computer and it still doesnt seem to fix it
---
My ship is The Bandwagon because our clan name has the word "Bandwagon" in it and the ship was on sale from Tess very early in D2 so several of us grinded to be able to afford it. It is the reason I want an "equipped" timer on ships.

What week is in the cycle for the dreaming city trying to get closer to completing curse breaker

I don’t have to open iTunes on my computer or anything to get it too work. It just automatically connects. Weird man

That's why you get a kill with another weapon first tho.
---
So many tokens wasted so sad
---
"ERROR APPROACHING!"
---
I know the feeling. In Japan, but my clan is all UK and America.
---
;)
---
This would create a whole new playerbase. 
---
Probably bring in a bunch of Rocket League players......
---
"Bungie" as a replacement for "they". They underestimate.
---
It actually comes out the day after tomorrow.
---
Do the synthrocepts have any special effect when the ability procs?
---
Why do you hate hunter's so much?
---
SRL was one of the best parts of Destiny 1... I miss it so much.
---
Whats that
---
Increased Range and Accuracy, moved to primary
---
Just a lamp from black magic fuckery
---
Gonna need more than a pistol lol
---
Time to dust off my Ghally.
---
is this a personal attack ?
---
umm thats exactly how they work, they scan for them running.  Doesnt matter if its injecting or not lol
---
There have been new things added with each season, for non seasonal pass players.  
---
Also, IMO all seasons , forsaken especially have been "you have no idea what you're missing".
---
This is a repost
---
Loaded question is a pinnacle weapon from Zavala, the 1 you have to get a bunch of arc kills. its a great gun.
---
The game in year 1 was dead. But like the Scorn, Destiny 2 was brought back from death with Forsaken and now we grow fat from strength! We have cast out Activision like we cast the Red Legion out of the Last City. The Moon may be haunted but only until September. Those Nightmares better sleep well while they can.
---
Could have used fat Thor as the pic. Missed opportunity.
---
Kids, gather round. Grampaw has to tell you all, about the time he was in a screenshot in a post on Reddit.
---
LMAO....you are hopeless
---
I thought dying 5 times before getting it was bad but my roommate said he's tried over 40 times and still can't get it lol, good luck all the same
---
Any personal reasoning?
---
And that's what happened with me. I missed my first Corsairsbane, and now I can't get any more
---
I got it from dismantling an armor piece, but since Dreaming Cast is the default armor colour, I couldn't say whether the armor had that shader pre-applied or not.
---
Talk to Benedict so you start the Season of Opulence story line which gets you to 690 instantly (after a few steps).
---
I think it drops on god roll weapons from the raid, that’s what I’ve heard anyway
---
Cool, good for him. Doesn't mean it was just because of one weapon. That's just silly. If it was because of the weapon, then he wouldn't be any better at comp if everyone else is using it, too.
---
I expected this to be about actual trees.
---
Couldn't just say "nice" or "good job"?  Had to one-up the dude in his own post?
---
I turned in 2500 tokens, got 13 Swarms, 4 with spiked, 1 had spiked + field prep. Guess I got lucky.
---
do your services include a complimentary shoulder charge?
---
jaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack shit
---
But of course.
---
I agree with you, but at the same time BMI which is what health care professionals use, is bullshit. I'm 6'-5" weigh 220lbs and I'm considered overweight. I have 14% body fat and hit the gym 4-6 days a week. These studies usually use BMI so I don't really trust them as far as factual evidence. 
---
But yes. America is fat. The thing I have been seeing is people who are overweight using the excuse of not being as far as obese people. "Oh I'm not as far as that guy so I don't have anything to worry about" except for your arteries are going to explode from that bacon grease you just mopped up with you half loaf of bread. The truth is these people are a few calories away from who they say they are not.
---
The order the acolytes spawn in is the order they will shoot in.
---
Grenade launchers got a strong buff and RPG's got a nerf to cluster damage.   
---
Prospector also got a bit of a rework and is really strong.
---
I mean when Kuwait is the biggest country that's fatter than you you're pretty damn fat.
---
The most recent posts I can find relating to this are from a year ago, and I'm mostly just looking for personal reasoning and experience
---
Shadowkeep. That’s why
---
"Curated" is the term you are looking for. Curated weapons are year 2 guns that drop fully masterworked, and don't have any toggle-able perk options. Whether or not they are good depends on the weapon, and curated guns do have special shaders, but the curated Last Wish guns have Dreaming Spectrum, not Dreaming Cast.
---
Then I'll add ya, my PSN is SaintAmici
---
I love meeting fellow Titans :)
---
Caffeinated
---
Alright go ahead and argue with me just to argue. He was a shit crucible player but now with LoW he is able to do well. Not everyone is using it cause most people are like you and just go "Oh LoW isn't that good I used to use it but now I don't and just cause your friend is doing good doesn't mean he is good."
---
Just bought d2 forsaken and Shadowkeep on Xbox for 80$ total. Hope it’s worth it. Forsaken is on sale for 40$ now
---
I really like the grind of it and it gets me hooked, but would grinding like that even be worth the effort without latest DLC? And have any particular game modes had you playing nonstop?
---
You have a Nvidia card. Run the GeForce Experience app, find destiny, click optimize. It’ll optimize the settings specifically for your system.
---
It's low key 3 edge transits all shit rolls that's why it's red
---
But there are still people (like me) who didn't know of this before this post. Some won't know until after it is inevitably patched, some won't know at all, but the people who now know of this bug because of this post are probably all happy that this was posted.
---
This is an opinion. You could also say a lot of people are forced to play PvE activities to farm things for pvp and that they should have more avenues for pvp enhanced gear and endgame items since it's much more challenging than pre determined AI. What's the main part for you might not be for another.
---
Unbalanced maps, unbalanced modes, shitty spawns.
---
As someone who has reached mythic in comp, I don't hate pvp any less.
---
Several control maps are inherently unbalanced, several countdown maps are unbalanced as well. Bullet magnetism, lag compensation is ridiculous. The matchmaking is pretty bad still.
---
&gt;$100 Complete edition
---
The complete edition is $40 USD right now, was it that one?
---
&gt;Now, as Shadowkeep is not released yet, I can't tell if i'll have access to it once the game comes out
---
It should say in the store what is included in the bundle you buy. When I look in the battle net store, it says the complete collection is the base game, year 1 DLC, Forsaken, and annual pass. Since it doesn't say shadowkeep, that means you do not have shadowkeep. 
---
Does the FAQ stickied to this subreddit help at all? If not, please post your question on the FAQ itself.
---
(This post has been removed as it is a very common duplicate question)
---
This is cool. Kudos on your bond and obviously shared Destiny love.
---
I understand. I know my comment is strictly an opinion. I don’t mean any harm to the PvP community. I didn’t mean to come off that way. My bad.
---
Raid bounties have the raid symbol on them
---
yes the $40 usd rn one.
---
Most exotic armour needs a buff, or at least 15 of them.
---
No, but the knives do.
---
You do the Traveler's work.
---
Make sparrows faster
---
I'm a gamer and lived in NY for ten years and I'm not an asshole. If you're gonna get all pissy about your teammates then put together a fireteam.
---
Does not work.
---
Also all I saw was people explaining it. Video is new for me.
---
definetely not so many kills...
---
* 3% per Scout Rifle final blow
---
* 3% per Auto Rifle final blow
---
* 3% per Fusion Rifle final blow
---
* 8% per Sniper Rifle final blow (approximately)
---
* 10% per Sword final blow (approximately)
---
Bottom tree has the combo I used in the vid to shutdown roaming supers, dawnblade being the hardest because flying
---
How I finished it last night, 14% for some heroic events and 14% for picking up a Werner chest off IO. It seemed to work on mars being that it’s the flashpoint. Unless they stealth fixed it last night, I finished the last portion without even playing any more games.
---
Oh hey the orpheus rig ornament I'm never going to get.
---
That Kinda Looks Like A DOSSING
---
My fav sniper in the game rn. Got a No Distractions/Box Breathing one on my first go around and havent looked back. Pair it with Knucklehead Radar so i can scope longer 👌👌👌
---
We don't know a single thing about Destiny 3. It was never officially confirmed at all.
---
It's annoying, I'll look into it
---
Or get sheep to do it, but he'd probably just remove something
---
The step for getting kills does, your rank does not. so you'll have to reach fabled in this season.
---
Lol I'm gonna be at that state of mind when I grind tonight
---
Yes. Once you've done the steps, you'll get one to go to the menagerie.
---
The year 1 crucible armour is back in the database so the same arguement regarding the ornaments for applies
---
That was last weeks. This week it is in "Chamber of Starlight", the lost sector in Rheasilvia (Top middle section of Dreaming City).
---
Go all the way to the end of the lost sector and the portal is on top of the platform at the back of the room. Good luck!
---
Makes sense, to some degree. Discontinue support for current once 9th Gen has had a chance to get her feet, then we all migrate to Destiny 2 in 60FPS.
---
There are 6 ascendant challenge locations that rotate from week to week. In this game, the week starts on Tuesday. Be sure you are looking at information for the current week. There is an infographic currently stickied to this subreddit with weekly information such as where the ascendant challenge is, and also Toland's quote on the bounty gives you a hint.
---
Thank you!
---
I thought this week it was in the lost sector in rheasiliva the chamber of starlight
---
Tbh I'd rather them make new ones. It would be a win/win either way. Veterans are happy with new things to get and retain the value of the gear that was available but now is not.
---
Nope, nothing here either. They said first 2 weeks of June, and its past that. 
---
I don't understand these jackets. All orders for them were finalized before 12/31/2018. How can it take 6 months to produce these jackets? I just want to wear it already! LOL
---
I looked up “June 11-18 ascendant challenge. Guess nobody has really said much about it yet
---
You're welcome!
---
Guardians only have ~190 health in the crucible so damage numbers won’t be huge. Also better devils usually tales 3-4 shots to kill, three headshots or two headshots and two body-shots
---
All classes hahe their ups and downs but they're all viable. They all have good supers for pvp but also very viable pve supers and abilities. Warlock is definitely a viable option
---
Ikr? Atleast I'm not the only one questioning what's going on.
---
I’m about to be a real warlock u/buff_broke_n3rd
---
What’s the bottom tree combo?
---
Bruh
---
Bro
---
I got one two days ago and got Suros Regime so not too bad.
---
I'm also annoyed because I bought warmind and curse of osiris
---
Is this what happens when two warlocks have sex?
---
lmao, well I guess that's one way to get people to stop complaining about OTV and Jotunn... lol
---
Sounds like you have Curse of Osiris but not Warmind, the second DLC. Warmind softcaps at 340 and hardcaps at 380. 
---
Forsaken went to 600
---
Annual pass:
---
Black armory to 650
---
Jokers wild to 700
---
Penumbra to 750
---
Remains to be seen what happens with Shadowkeep.
---
But only weapons.
---
I feel like some Brit made this
---
This is the most cop-out non apology I've ever seen. Been a hardcore gamer since the mid-90s and honestly his behavior is pretty emblematic of the shitty douchebros you tend to see in PvP-centric game modes. It's not his fault though, it's where he was raised and the fact he's a PvPer that makes him such a shitty toxic asshole. Right.
---
Oh I didn't purchase osiris or warmind but I still have them
---
Erentil is a crutch too.
---
For some those blues are dropping higher than their current equipment in that slot.  If it was auto deleted, it would not help them level up.  (If you havenot hit soft cap yet, this is what would happen.)  I use DIM and pull in to my character if needed to clean out the postmaster without traveling back to the tower, but I rarely get to the point that I need to do that. 
---
You should be stopping at the PM every time you hit the tower and deleting unwanted items to keep it cleanned out.  It doesn't take that long.  If you don't want to stop, use DIM and delete while moving between activities.
---
I don't know if I'd blame the US for other countries obesity problems.
---
Well, that was fucking rude
---
I started using Nazarecs sin with full void loudout and it’s been fun,  bottom tree has actually revealed itself to be really fun since devour refills health and a good chunk of grenade energy with every kill, you can throw infinite grenades if you aim them right and each kill adds to how long nazzarecs sin will continue to accelerate your power regens, not sure what the acceleration factor is though
---
They have turned the ship around are on course!
---
Geomags all the way my dude
---
I agree, my bro and I have been rocking bottom tree and it duels other supers really well as well as the dodging resist can close the gap nicely.
---
More like they did a mutiny on ol' Captain Smacktivision and took control of the ship!
---
Oh damn, any exact date?
---
That probably why I can’t stop playing it
---
Eh wouldn’t blame them but I’d say they have more of a say than anybody else. Spam is USA made. And they have five guys and Karl’s junior as well as Taco Bell and much more
---
Bump, because this is what we do too.
---
for warlocks yes
---
YES and New Age Black Armory shader looks great on it too.
---
&gt;  supremacy are fun 
---
So many people disagree with you that supremacy got removed from the playlist for quickplay. Year 1 was full of people complaining about hating supremacy.
---
As far as Showdown goes, the playlist is barely alive as a weekly playlist. It would be worse as a dedicated playlist. 
---
&gt; breakthrough is great
---
Again doesnt have a high population even as a flavor of the week offering. Again would be worse as a dedicated playlist. Generally neither breakthrough nor lockdown were well received for a variety of reasons
---
&gt; They all could replace countdown which has way too many rounds  
---
Interesting how you are advocating for a mode to be replaced in a comment on the topic of how more modes should be available.
---
&gt;  but the problem is the rotating list which removes the mode even if you like it for a month or more. 
---
This is not a problem but a solution. The modes are put on a playlist precisely so more people will play it. More people play mayhem and ironbanner, because they are limited time modes. If Mayhem and any other playlist is out all the time, interest dies and only the ones who exclusively like that mode stay. 
---
As an example lets use gears of war 3, a game my brother enjoyed. In that game there are huge numbers of playlists with 0 players in it. As a result, he cant play any of his favorite modes at all. But if they were a part of the main playlist, he may not be able to play it all of the time, but he could play it SOME of the time.
---
Already even as the highest population it can get, even just a single playlist special playlist of Showdown has severe population issues. Spreading out that among 5 or more playlists just makes it worse. 
---
Again, there is a reason why Bungie in Rise of Irons "Age of Triumph" cut their game modes in half. Because they simply did not have enough players consistently playing those modes.
---
&gt; Also lol @ the "Destiny is a PvE game!". I don't know why this is the new PVE mains mantra but it's dumb.  
---
The only thing you should be LoLing at is your reply. Destiny IS primarily a PvE game. Period. The amount of content and activities(and player base) dwarfs anything about PvP. Bungie themselves have mentioned this as Crucible for a while has been a after thought. Any time the game has been presented, it always has been focused around PvE and the story(which is part of PvE)  
---
However it seems you are misunderstanding what I said. I did not say "Destiny is a PvE game". I said SPECFICIALLY, " a *PvE* **first** game". PvE is the primary basis and focus of the game, that does not make it the most important or only basis of the game. I am not saying PvP isnt just as important as PvE, or even that PvE is more popular than PvP. Just stating a simple fact of the game, that PvE has always been the first priority and main emphasis of the franchise.
---
&gt;  Pvp is literally the reason the game survived especially in between  seasons as PVE dies after so long, unless you like the same strike that  you can do blindfolded after the 10th time. 
---
Here you are conflating my "Destiny is a PvE first game" into something I didnt say "PvP doesnt matter". When content droughts occur, people go elsewhere and PvP players are left behind. There is no denying one bit how important PvP is to Destiny. Particularly Trials of Osiris. People watching those cool streamers use satisfying guns and space magic are important to keep people playing the game as well as introducing fresh blood.  
---
I do think you are ignoring the fact that people do like doing the same content again, and denying the existence of that part of the game.
---
&gt; Most people who play PvP also play pve mostly for the gear... TO PLAY PVP. 
---
That is true because PvE again is the main emphasis in the game. Otherwise there could be playlist specific loot sets, and more sources of powerful gear.
---
But guess what, the reverse is also true, particularly with pinnacle weapons. People who set foot in crucible to get their loot and get out as fast as possible.
---
And then you also have the numerous amounts of people who play only PvE, never setting foot in crucible at all.
---
&gt; They ignore pvp a lot, it's fact. I don't get why everyone gets  defensive and twisted when people ask for new PvP things like they might  not get a new mission if they actually release PvP maps like they said  they would. 
---
They would not ignore something if it was the primary focus of the game.
---
 If people actually are getting defensive and twisted when people ask for new PvP things, you are right, I dont understand that at all. That certainly isnt the case here.  
---
You are not asking for anything new with PvP here, nor do I think you understand why PvP playlists are the way they are(because of very low dead playlists when separate). If more people consistently played other playlists, then there could be enough to separate the playlists again. But even with a popular mode like rift it didnt have many players who stuck around. And often even with this flavor of the week approach with rotating playlists, populations are usually bad. As in bad to the point where private matches have more players than it.
---
Destiny may be a PvE first game. But it is not a PvE only game. It is a game designed to please many people and offer diverse ways to enjoy and earn the satisfying loot in the game. It is ABSOLUTELY a PvE and PvP game, and designed for players to play both, not exclude one or the other. Anyone who says PvP doesnt matter is ridiculous, in the same way a player who chooses to solo only asking for raids to be made solo is ridiculous. 
---
Both matter equally. PvP can help keep player base alive during content droughts, and PvE brings a surge of new life into the game. Destiny may have an emphasis, but PvP is just as crucial to the game, unlike games like warframe where it is just tacked on.
---
 I myself am a player of ALL content. It wont be too much longer till I earn my Unbroken seal, or until my next sherpa run. I play all the content for the content itself. I play just as much of each throughout the entire season. I dont play PvE for PvP, I play PvE with PvP.
---
Finally I would love to have more options to select playlists. I just recognize it isnt a realistic expectation given reality.
---
Awesome! Im so hype for September! Between borderlands and destiny I'm almost overwhelmed in the best way possible
---
If you want the last 3 seasons, the only way to buy them now is:
---
$40 - Forsaken /Annual Pass Combo
---
$15 - Annual Pass on sale if you own Forsaken
---
Shadowkeep will not unlock These last 3 seasons. Shadowkeeps Season pass will include the next 3 seasons after Shadowkeep.
---
How is it??? I got open with trench and pulse monitor.... i feel like even with full auto it’s gonna shoot too slow to keep trench protected..
---
YOUR BREATHTAKING
---
Austringer Roll?
---
Hunted, just need to be high level enough to kill everything. Split into 2 teams of 3. Always 2 plates up. Once one team captures one, go to the next. Each team should be able to capture 3.
---
Mockery, split 2-2-2 and have 1 defender for each haven and 1 runner. Working as a team and doing it fast, should be good enough. 
---
Oh, and heavyweight day is best day since bosses die twice as fast.
---
Not me. Ugly enemy
---
I played D2Vanilla to Max LL and dropped it. To me it wasn't that fun. But after getting it for free a while back on PC, *AND* getting the Y1 content for free, I'm a very happy camper with the game currently. Just finished Curse of Osiris and starting Warmind soon. I will say, however, that Vanilla D1 quests are still exceedingly boring, and that it needed at least Curse of Osiris amounts of content to make it feel like a complete game.
---
Try legendary swords. I seem to remember thinking that exotic swords were weird and didn't count sometimes for certain things.
---
I would check with a legendary and see if that helps. Otherwise, I am not sure!
---
I see now. Thank you
---
Ah
---
So now I gotta grind strikes and stuff?
---
Pretty sure grave robber/trench barrel is universally suggested by YouTubers. 
---
How does full-auto beat out auto-reload on melee kill?
---
It is really good, and it can shoot all of the shots off during the perk timer
---
Best of luck on your search!
---
Hey fish and chips is great.
---
Its worthit.
---
It rolls on this and the threat level shotgun
---
You said u like the "mix" here. Yet where is the mix. Yay I wanna say I just my last piece for a badge. Instant delete cos its an achievement post. If u wanna post a meme go to the meme subreddit. I'm all for the raid secrets reddit those boys r like Gods. But denying us some camaraderie from finishing levelling or badges etc due to it being a "denies loot/achievement/completion" rule trust me me and hundreds of ppl I know will steer clear of this as this is 100% against bungies philosophy of embracing player accomplishments
---
Yeah I feel like that would be a good roll but for DPS as a shotgun full auto is better
---
Main thing is that everything silver is just cosmetic so unless fashion is a must or you have cash to splash most people aren't gonna spend money on something that is worthless
---
We don't know what else is going on in his life though
---
Still not okay to lash out at random people online
---
nah, youre the asshole here, im sure. And thats some low quality bait youre dishing out. All titles are special. Because theyre TITLES
---
Okay fair point
---
I guess grave robber just makes more sense to me since I use shotguns on Majors and only really use full auto (IKELOS/Threat Level) on bosses. 
---
The Rate of Fire on this thing cannot be good for boss DPS. But to each their own.
---
So In the same respect I guess
---
You need to do what the key mold says. If it says to do strikes, then you must do strikes to progress it.
---
Yeah it's not good for boss DPS but is a backup plan when my prospector runs out of ammo. I love grave robber and might go for a roll with that on this shotgun too.
---
&gt; You don't need every item in the whole game, if acquiring it is not fun. 
---
I was about to quit for this reason, except the previous owner of this gun is someone pretty integral to the story. Not owning it because I don't want to suffer through PvP seemed like it would ruin the rest of the game for me. 
---
That said, I just got 25 headshots. I'm actually not as bad as I let on. Used to play a lot of competitive FPS, but those days are behind me. Still, once I completed that quest step, I switched weapons and got five in a row, including this annoying player that had been killing me for the entire time I was trying for precision shots. It felt like the old days, for a moment.
---
Yo i didn't know lol, I have no problem with gay people at all, but uhh memes? It's funny?
---
Damn bro it’s just something I didn’t know about. Calm down brother
---
This picture is loud

This is why I light level grind my Warlock at Golden Corral

how do you get the icons animated in rainmeter?

You must not have played lustful tentacle monster 2

NA
---
I watch Baken for pvp goodness, i could care less about his toxicity
---
 synesthesia
---
If it weren't for Cayde, I wouldn't care. Major character in the storyline, and saw how he got beat up facing off against overwhelming odds. I suppose I've always been kind of sentimental. 
---
All done, though. It was a pain but I'm not as bad as I thought. Still lost three rounds for my team doing it, but the moment I focused on getting kills it became much easier to drop players on the opposing team. I'll look into other hand cannons for PvE as well, tnx.
---
is there anywhere to get just forsaken? or is the annual pass a must
---
I’m about to start using it just to piss people off  XD
---
You mean all the caches? Think I'll go finish all that right now, so I can look at it in my inventory. All shiny and new.
