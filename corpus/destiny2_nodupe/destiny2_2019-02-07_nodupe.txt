Aachen LR2 is still fantastic

True
---
Nice man!! Congrats! That‚Äôs a tough one right there!
---
Nice. I'm still 40% away from completing mine. I need the bosses from the Sniper and SMG week I think.
---
Rare bounty just will not drop for me :(
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE 
---
What helmet is that
---
nice
---
I give you my luck my dude!!! you got this!
---
Call your ISP and have them reprovision your router. 
---
Was he a scrawny wimp like an actual Hunter too?
---
Thanks man! I was going through my uncompleted Catalysts a few weeks ago and I had that "...oh no." moment when I remembered I never finished Worldline, haha. Fast forward to today, long cloak boy was finally the last boss I needed :D
---
This is where a hunter trap comes in lol
---
I've only been 50 for like 3 weeks what's going on in this? 
---
Oooohhhhh, sorry. 
---
Thank you! And yeah, I dislike that it's basically time-locked over 5 weeks minimum, but I guess it kinda makes it more satisfying when you finally finish it (:
---
Don‚Äôt have last word yet, haven‚Äôt felt like playing crucible. 
---
Only modes, they drop something called bray tech schematic which gives you a chance of the weapon 
---
thanks for the info. good to know. will be deleting this post so people dont get annoyed. thanks again!
---
I like you

Once you've gotten it from a sleeper node, I believe it is then in her packages. But my memory is hazy.

i believe you are right. thanks

I refuse to stand for this, r/titansriseup üò§
---
I have the same question.
---
Yep, banshee is your guy if you don't have forsaken. I did the same thing when I joined back in September. Just grind his rewards for forsaken weapons. (Please God bungie, if you are not going to lower enhancement core costs, at least lower the cost at banshee. The lvl 20s could use a break.)
---
Follow
---
Same here. Just refuses to drop. 
---
Exactly this , you are not entitled to everything my boy. You are allowed to enjoy it as much as you want though. Like i said , choices .

---
 It is a pinnacle reward for those who are dedicated to the PvP side of the game. 
---
I mean he could have just been pretending to fit in. 
---
Well he isn't so useless after that so..
---
This is my coworker that sits behind me. 
---
Just make sure to aim for the gun and try not to miss. Everything else before that is pretty simple. Take your time and pay attention. I died a few times myself before I realize my reaction was slow because I was intoxicated so I did it the next day lol. 
---
Totally not... üòâ
---
Forsaken is an add on. 
---
Damn you
---
Why apologise ? I have the same feeling that you have. Minus the raid. Haven't tried any because of life. I don't have the annual pass ever but i have forsaken. The story was good but i have lost interest in the game. Haven't touch it for month. 
---
It's not really hard, just might take a few tries to get the timing right, but once you have that down you'll get it done in no time. 
---
thank you so much
---
You can abandon them if you want, but most of them reward exotics so I wouldn‚Äôt.
---
Nope, warlock for life
---
I hadn't thought in terms of Well but yes, that'd be similar, but not simply killing ads to spawn the Primeval, still mote collecting. You could have some people who hold 15 motes while trying to burn Prime 1 so they can immediately bank towards Prime 2 at the risk of wizards or the Prime shredding them (with some occasional invasions) and I think it'd create more tension and strategy. Maybe I am wrong but I wonder if it'd be all that hard to program if they just use existing assets. 
---
only reason i‚Äôm gonna see it now
---
Always shoot them in the order they spawn in.
---
As a 35 year old dad I feel what you‚Äôre saying. It‚Äôs hard to find guilt free gaming time with all that life throws at you. Waking up at 4:25 am to go to the gym before work makes a man not want to go home after work and spark up the PS5 at 10:00pm and game for 2 hours. You have to pick your times and make them count. 
---
Comp game modes are more fun to me if the teams are both evenly matched.

Then that item is basically useless unless you get the expansion. You can it dismantle for materials. Also, don't infuse it to another item as you won't be able to use that item.

Worm husk is an exotic not a subclass. Arcstrider was still meta after wormhusk nerf.
---
Oh ok thanks
---
Same hes stingy with the masterworks now.
---
Appreciate it brother 
---
Has it gotten nerfed yet? I‚Äôm running GG simply because I like being a space cowboy but I do really like the power in the new tree.
---
It's already unlocked. You can go to it anytime you want. 
---
I'm right there with you guys. I work night shift and game some while the wife and kids are still asleep when I get off
---
Try really hard.
---
And increased blast radius the higher you land from.
---
In PvP I use it to block my getaway. Also, I have the exotic chest that heals me whenever I cast the barrier. If I don't use it for that, I set it as barbed wire, so to say. I'll drop it in a high traffic area around a corner so hopefully the baddies will turn the corner and hurt themselves (or kill themselves if they're already low) on it.
---
You need to finish the quest. The cabal multikills and what not, and then get like 10 seals from the raid.  The version you have is the prototype that only has 1 round in the mag, and it‚Äôs not in your collection yet

Would the hydra sized ducks retain their spammy shots with the same size and strength as one big hydra?
---
Dropped one with great stats at Range and Stability yesterday with Rampage...üëå
---
Yep, same here
---
Play quickplay but play to stay alive not just to mess around. Im assuming those stats you're referring to are the end match efficiency. That's not actual KD so  those aren't actually very good stats. Chances are you're not actually getting many kills and are actually  getting mostly assists. Which means you would lose most gunfights in comp. Besides needing to be good at winning your 1v1s  you also need a whole wack of other skills to play comp including map awareness, correct loadout for map and good load out knowledge in general(use meta weapons). You need to know how to play with strategy and play the objective, you need to know when to engage and disengage. It takes a lot of skill and effort to win comp matches. It's hard to stay in the sweaty dont make any mistakes type of mindset for an entire match and every second of it and that's  just not for some people. That being said it just takes a lot of practice playing in a competitive mindset until it pays off. 
---
Light Level doesn't have an effect on gameplay.. New players can enjoy the game they purchased.
---
Yeah true. Thanks a lot for the tips. I usually get like 20-30 kills in a good game but recently I have been doing worse. I'll try my best to improve.
---
Go to benedict, you can re-acquire it from him. And the game‚Äôs only been out for a year and a half

That‚Äôs one cold blooded callus

Scene from Firefly?
---
I feel you on that. I‚Äôve had games where I get 60 kills and we still lose by 4-5 points
---
Radiolarian one to be precise
---
There's a secret to shooting the gun lol. Ads and yellow bar are easy pickings with the right load out. The mission also has the Suppressed Modifier on so your health only rises when you pick up a light pool from killed enemies and your abilities recharge quite slowly. 
---
Maybe it is not a trivial thing to find these players and/or grant them stuff.

Far enough away to hit the chaos reach melee. You could be down a hallway and still get hit by it.

You swiped the 2nd from another guardian, didn't you?! CONFESS!!

Match summary says 23-2 92% Won.  Losses where from quickplay.  All 21 matches won in competitive were the same KD 0.00 KDA 0.00

Mercy rule probably doesn't exist in lockdown, it only takes three rounds to win so there's not really any way to implement the existing style of mercy because it's based of # of points.

He could have screen shot a single video showing anything destiny related 
---
&gt;Titans dont get movement like that
---
titans are the fastest class in the game wtf are you on about
---
No dnf next to names.  Also no one appears as opponents and match counts as wins.  21 wins in a row with no opponents.
---
Astronomically low,please bless me with your rng
---
*your ;)
---
Sorry that i want actual content on reddit and not just "go Google this"
---
Could have screenshot a single destiny related thing from the dudes channel 
---
No but it sucks to pay for content then loose out due to a bug and get jack shit in return for this 
---
No dnf next to names. Last 21 matches have no opponents and the matches still count as wins.
---
No,long answer no because pinnacle weapons stay with each season,eg lunas,nf and redrix broadsword stayed as the crucible pinnacles alongside mountaintoo
---
Yes its 3am forgive me for not giving a damn about grammar. The screenshots fine it would be the same thing with a different thumbnail of the guy holding something up. Find it yourself instead of demanding everything be done YOUR way
---
Maybe on pc

Same tbh but maybe that means it'll be harder for bungie to patch lol

You could technically report all these people for griefing if you wanted to. 
---
You know that the big orange button in the middle of his shield is a weak point (for some reason), right? 
---
It took me a long time to figure that out, because I guess common sense just dictated there was no way there'd be a big off button right in the middle of the thing designed to save your ass, but it's true. Don't even worry about his feet, just pop the button and watch him stagger.
---
There is a magical thing called cover. Not only does it block a shot from j√∂tunn, but also everything else. If you stay close to it, you can easily dodge behind it when j√∂tunn is fired.
---
What was the message from the enemy guy? 
---
Solution Move LEFT OR RIGHT, it has great vertical tracking but TERRIBLE left or right tracking. It's legit not that overpowered honestly just stop jumping and Move to the side
---
I feel that, but my main issue is that i don't airways know they have it, and i just got tracked through my dawnblade super speed
---
Is just strafing faster than jumping?
---
Sense your frustration but I don't agree. 
---
It takes 14 years to charge up, by which time you simply shoot the Guardian using it or walk marginally to the left or right. 
---
You must have a different experience to me when facing it in the Crucible. I can only comment on my own experience which is that you need to be a good player to use it well and if I get killed with it occasionally then so be it - crikey, I get killed by Wardcliffe more often. Talk about track spamming -boom-dead. But they've worked hard to get the heavy pickup and deserve some reward to! Swings and Roundabouts. 
---
I really dislike you right now XD
---
Congrats - I got that yesterday too, seems like a good day for Wayfarers!

It‚Äôs not the free time I we used to have huh ?  Red Dead Redemption 2 is a struggle to get through at my snails pace but I wouldn‚Äôt change it for the world.  I just hope he‚Äôs into gaming himself.

all of them

I‚Äôve run it more times that I can count man. There‚Äôs always one thing that eludes you.

You can still aim the gun normally. Unless your username is dpf1110.
---
Vex
---
Think so. Long time was the grind for those EP weapons. Luckily i got the Cat the first time i was in "Spire of Stars" prestige mode. We didnt even finish but i got it within the pre-boss phase :-)
---
You won't find many primary ammo weapons that do any great amount of damage to bosses to be honest. Stacking damage perks like rampage is the only way to get decent DPS on a primary. I'd probably argue bows do decent damage per shot but not necessarily high DPS. 
---
Blue weapons were heavily produced because they were better versions of the green/common prototype.   Legendary/purple are custom made weapons, so they can have perks that work better for a player and their play style.   Exotics are unique because they are made from materials that can only be found on other planets.   ‚Äúexotic materials‚Äù or ‚Äúexotic matter‚Äù is why they are rare and weapons don‚Äôt have random rolls, ie, Telesto the weapon, made from materials found on Telesto the moon of Saturn.
---
If you want dps with kinetic ammo then use a handcannon. Autos, smgs scouts and even pulses are good for crowd control but not ideal to take down bigger guys.

It‚Äôs a nice looking skirt no

Ok, that looks better than any armor in the game

I hate hearing "the hive has summoned at ogre" in the more bored, flat voice acting since dinklebot

Dude I know the struggle. What system you on?

Pc or console..?

I would spend all my 11k shards and all my cores to bring back my old dead orbit armor, tactical af
---
Nice, sounds good for pvp.
---
The desire sensor knows. I've been trying to get a OEM for months now. It's the only titan exotic that I don't have. Finding exotics is not hard but the y1 dupes are just too common, it's demoralizing.
---
Good Job! Still trying to get it. Must've been a pain lol
---
Pc now

I would love to, but my computer just crashed on me so it may be a while üò•

Look up queenbreaker 3d print on google and youll find plenty of good ones. I used the one from the instructables.

What is that sniper? I‚Äôve been looking for one close to 1000 yard stare and this seems close
---
Hah this. My thoughts exactly, but also hunters and their capes.
---
I love the last word, it‚Äôs such a cool gun. I‚Äôm gonna do a batch of 10 eventually lol
---
Yes you must dedicated all your time in quick play as tribute. A 3/4 of your kills must be with the god delivered dust rock blues, while your not forgotten is only used for the last 1/4 to make the gods giggle a bit. Heh.
---
Finger guns
---
Ok lol
---
Damn shax you can only murder other guardians if your in the crucible

I'm hoping to get money this weekend im about 1800

Yeah, that helps alot, thanks!

Do the kalli encounter

Can you please repost with the GT's blurred out. I understand this is a significant exploit that really needs addressing, but we can't have a gamers identity on this sub, especially if it paints them in a negative light.

Thanks a lot!

Missing 4 exotics all together. Geomags, Ursas, Cerberus+1 and Lord of wolves

Just go with Lemon Arch. Keeps it in my head.

Killing them basically allows you to kill the primevil much faster. If you've ever heard Drifter say "primevil compromised" that's because of the buff you get from killing the envoys. It's hugely important to take them out first and can mean the difference between winning and losing. 
---
I prefer Yeebe.
---
Killing the envoys weakens the primeval- gives you the primeval Slayer buff, so you'll do a ton more damage to him
---
Just to clarify... there are 3 new supers not 9, 9 supers in total but 6 are from Y1 
---
It was a very easy quest......
---
4 hours top to get it done.
---
The original Thorn and Chaperone quests were much more difficult.
---
Did you punch them?
---
If not your not a real titan smh my head
---
A very long crucible quest involving a lot of ranked play
---
Right, makes sense for pve. Sixth coyote makes one forget about reloads. And playing intoxicated doesn't help either i guess

So I did! I knew the order of the attack, but I died sime time whis the second or third mob. A bit annoying ^_^`

To anyone who thinks this might be animal cruelty, I see where you are coming from. But I owned a similar kind of fish and they are quite resilient, being a member of the goldfish family. Doing this will not harm them if you are gentle. Thanks for the concern though.
---
Honestly I loved reading this and I have quite a few questions. 
---
1) where'd you find your comp team? I try lfg's and clans but I dunno its just not as fun.
---
2) how did you control the anger? (You probably said it and I'm probably blind but I mean hey)
---
3) what was the roll on your trust and do you think there are any other hand cannons that would work that aren't exotic?
---
Primeval melt is not OP, the problem is matchmaking doesn‚Äôt diversify fire teams to include all classes so if you solo queue like me then having the right set up to melt and everyone being on the same page is rare.
---
Was wondering if I was the only one getting tired of this. 
---
The game is primarily a PvE game (from a content perspective), so it makes sense that a lot of players are only in PvE. And speaking as a Crucible-hater, the feel of PvP matches is much different than the feel of PvE, so it's not surprising that the people who enjoy PvE might not have the same fun in PvP.
---
(plus there aren't particularly good incentives for playing PvP other than shooting human opponents)
---
I got all the way to the last boss and called in backup because i was getting too tilted. Make sure to kill the wizards when they spawn in the 3rd phase, or have something ready to 1 hit ko the last 1/3 of the boss's health.
---
It‚Äôs in the shared title?
---
With a stability masterwork I feel like the counterbalance stock is overkill
---
YEAH. AND? I DON'T CARE. I'M SUPERIOR TO YOU MFER
---
hunters are immune to some of their own grenades, i think, but it's possible, i guess. tho i only use it when i know i'll face arc-based enemies
---

Thank you! Im thinking something with rapid hit would work well, with aggressive frame,rapid hit and head hunter being ideal. 
---
Was waiting to be transferred to Skyrim for the millionth time 
---
r/ComedyCemetery
---
Arsenic then would probably be easiest, since it has archers temp intrinsically 
---
To answer your question about the enemies being immune, it all has to do with your power level.  Check here to see a break down of the [power level curve](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/9gwl1u/powerlevel_based_damage_scaling_in_pve_aka_power/). Also, in raids they don't come out and say it but the recommended power level is for the start of the raid.  It can scale up as you make your way through the encounters.  
---
Life is fun with bullets.

Life is awesome when YOU are the bullet.

Yup, i'd go targeting adjuster, it makes all the numbers yellow

Get a bounty, that will solve the problem. But it's annoying. 6 resets and all I need is pillager for dredgen. 
---
4- I play exclusively on console ps4, never really had the funds to get a pc even though I really want to stream games :)
---
5- well when I first got lunas it was in incredible feeling, magnificient howl does actually give it an extended range due to the damage from the 3 tap which can out gun a full range with range perk trust.
---
The NF though.. whole other monster, at some ranges you feel like the lunas bullets ghost whilst on the NF you're mapping people with magnificent howl, sure its got more recoil, but since its a 180 its barely different to the lunas. It is a gun you all should grind for through blood sweat and tears it honestly is that good. (with a target adjuster mod your headshot game will be on point even when you think you miss, I value that more than extended mag).

WATASHI GA KITA, GUARDIANS!

The Crucible team has made clear that they believe comp is about team play. While I would also love a lone wolves playlist, I think it very unlikely.

*sigh* Ok, I'll give some tries. For malfeasance.

If it isn't good, I'll hunt you on crucible.

Just joking, I gave up on crucible too.

yup about an hour after making this post, the weekly strike milestone gave me 2 crimson hand cannons. i had also bought crimson from xur a few weeks ago üò≠

Look on the bright side, at least you're being a dick about it

Might try that :)

Yah I think it‚Äôs still in the known issues stuff.

If you go to there help site there should be a list

its for a reason. I've had my shots blocked by legionaries multiple times.  one time it was with 19 batteries and 2 secs left. we lost
---
This is the most titan thing i've ever seen
---
http://www.destinyreset.net Strike Daily should have been the only one to reset today. Weird 4 day daily resets. Gambit Daily is tomorrow. Maybe that update yesterday did something it shouldn't have.
---
How? I have thousands that I don't for much with aside from spamming simulation seeds when they are for sale with shards. I guess I assumed everyone else had this issue.
---
Looks like the Fuel Rod Cannon from Halo. I'm down for it to be an exotic, probably as a raid exotic in a vex themed raid.
---
Then why u comment?
---
That's a bright side indeed.

&gt;Ornament
---
Yes , Sunshot  **Ornament** too .
---
I think the highest person in my clan has 70k

At that point I just get sneaky with my peeks, and sometimes regret it.

Just run it with friends first a few times. I soloed it at the end of the very first week it was out
---
It‚Äôs ok at least we have Nova Warp....
---
Welcome to the JAM! 
---
Max available score right now is around 71k I think. With your score, you have around 85% of the available triumph points, so that's pretty good. Anything above 50 or 55k is good IMO.
---
Refurbished black armory is not a guaranteed drop in dismantle. All of the others are though
---
Hey guys, if you are looking for active players our clan has plenty and we do raids very often. Most of our players are 21 and up so no worries about kids raging and things. We are all adults who enjoy the game but also have outside lives. Feel free to search 
---
We Could Be Better in the clan search. 
---
Lol because it require so much skill to use the gun
---
Same thing happened to me last week. Bugged on Ether tanks, went to do something on my main, (was unlocking on my alt) logged back in later and no frame in my inventory. The forge was unlocked on the character, though, and I was able to forge a HC immediately.
---
Congratulations! Aim just a bit higher than you think you should and pop some heads!

okay weird but thanks for the anwser it was so fast give me that shit ok i am purlple thanks bye what do u expect it was so weird and still 30 fps great work XD

I really like always look like that. Happened to me in a gambit. I got so excited that was banking motes fast and often to see my guardian lol
---
Forsaken is great and absolutely worth it anyway. 
---
The game you are playing now is practically a demo for what you have with Forsaken added on. It added a lot. 
---
Me too üòÇ

This bad boy can fit so ma-

Pretty sure voluntary griefing is a bannable offense, or at least can result in an account suspension.

I felt it in Destiny 1

You should really start tagging your art work if this keeps happening. Just a simple Social handle near the bottom would do the trick. Not only does it naturally give credit to yourself, but it helps others looking for sauce when reposting to give proper sauce. 
---
Never thought i'd see something i made reposted.
---
It‚Äôs not hard, my point is that I‚Äôve played all the classes and keep coming back to titan because it‚Äôs satisfying. But also find blade barrage satisfying when you get multiple people. 
---
I definitely would not mind having some shorter warlock robes like that 
---
Yes, moon‚Äôs haunted
---
Great OC!
---
Alright thank you!
---
Flashed out of existence? Seems like something the Vex would do.
---
What‚Äôs amazing about this screenshot is that the opposing team ever summoned the primeval in the first place
---
Protect the runner is easy i get it by accident usually. Run tether with orpheus rigs if ur a hunter if not, find a hunter who can tether spam
---
Depends how often you play and if you get a streak going, sometimes it can take a few days other the whole time. But good idea getting on discord. 
---
\*claps and tears up\* seriously tho, congrats dude!
---
Congrats! I just need secret victories which won‚Äôt drop for me lmao 
---
GONNA BASH YOU INTO RED MILK.
---
Yeah, that's cool. I like the 3d twine art style. Good job!
---
Depends. QP you will get a lot of different people.  
---
Comp has much fewer players.
---
I played comp last night and in like 10 games we had the same like 6 people just shuffling teams. It was a lot of fun. You start to learn their playstyles and try to counter them
---
I fire few you shaxx isn‚Äôt going to mess with how guardians fight for TV ratings
---
He may however edit the parameters of the guns using his crucible firmware to make guardians adjust to and learn a different way of fighting then what they have become used to 
---
Idk, let bygones be bygones. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
---
I don't have fighting lion equipped, but the bounty counter for the catalyst still increases as i complete bounties. 
---
What did people not like about last word quest.... It was solid all round. Took like 4 hours.
---
I feel bad using Thunderlord in Gambit, but it's finally gotten me a winning streak, and I'm able to carry more blueberries. 
---
I finally lost my streak when one Guardian kept nabbing the heavy ammo and then wouldn't invade.. lol
---
Bygones ornament. Get it from Tess everiss
---
I've had this happen to me, except my team killed the meatball and won, but my McDonald's wifi cut out and I was kicked before the match ended

Nah shard it 
---
TBH, it hates us all sometimes
---
False, hes not being pushed backed and stuck mid air by eye beams
---
I blare barraged that dude and that one blade barrage made him fall off the map 3 times..
---
Looks ok now all it need is a real time reaction to the sound coming out 
---
Go eat a dick you elitist fuck.  Oh, look at me, I think I'm good at a video game.
---
Bet that gets you far with the ladies..
---
THE NECK
---
Oh. No, you don't actually have to have the weapon for it to drop, you just have to get it from wherever it drops from. Tractor cannon being one of those found in the wild.
---
With that blasted rock shaking, Earth shattering machinery!!
---
*BA DUM TSS*
---
Good ol‚Äô console and it‚Äôs 30fps problems. What happened is he got radiant seeds as well as the fighting lion catalyst and because console OMEGALUL it overshadowed the seeds and it told him he got 11 catalysts.
---
That is one sexy motherfuckin‚Äô Hunter! Congrats!
---
Straight from weekley eververse, costed 30 dolers

When you get ready to work on this here is a tip:
---
Fill up your consumables before you make any codes.  The codes you make will then go to your post office and you can make as many as your post office will hold.  You can then use DIM to transfer them, or pick up all the ones you need for a specific area at one time.  You can actually hold more than one at a time, you just cant make one if you are already holding one.  
---
When picking them up watch for duplicates.  Leave the dups and get them after you have cleared out all the ones you picked up first.  (I usually leave the dupes, go to another area and clear them, then come back for the dupes.)
---
While this does not help with RNG, it does make the grind a little quicker, because you can pick multiples in one location without going back and forth across the map. 
---
Also, if you are wanting the emblem for all 40 nodes opened, go to d2checklist to see which ones you still need to open.  You will need to pay attention to where you are standing when you create codes.  If you need one in futurescape you should not be in futurescape when making nodes.  You will find that there is a major area that the codes are for based on where you are when making them, a secondary area, and then a few from other areas.  I made 15 the other day (redoing my titan) while standing in futurescape.  Majority were Drift, with 5 in Descent, 2 in Arora's Reach, and 1 in mindlab.
---
Thx. üòú
---
Nice job, man!
---
Although I have some trouble calling you a "casual" player if you've got *any* title lol
---
The tracking is pretty trash imo. If I see anyone with a fusion in gambit or crucible I just stay moving the shot almost always misses.
---
Hahahaha sorry man, that happened to me a few times too.  "I am going to make it....going to make it...." BAM!!! Nope.
---
Wish i had that beauty of a bow
---
The fuck. I'm very unlucky if that's true.. i don't have wardcliff catalyst and never got it dropped either..
---
It's the Not Forgotten hand cannon. The red card quest shaxx sells. The best hand cannon imo
---
Might be a dumb question but do you have an annual pass to max the characters?
---
That‚Äôs a weird way of drawing Queenbreakers‚Äô Bow
---
I played nearly every day in the last 2 months...but just 2-3 hours in the evenings. I would say it's casual. üòú
---
Thanks now i have a reason to send anime to my friends
---
Literally impossible? 
---
Once I saw the white screen, I was honestly waiting and hoping to just see the title screen appear. Slightly disappointed, but still upvote. 
---
Yes. Have one. 
---
replace gwisin vest with oathbreakers and you have mine as well
---
Umm, pretty sure it drops 100% the first time you kill it..
---
Thanks. My Hunter and Titan are both 610 and was wondering if I should 600 my Warlock first before purchasing the AP.
---
If it makes you feel better, I have only three non-RNG catalysts myself.
---
comes preloaded with the fallen club soundtrack from the tangled shore. 
---
I've got a glitch for calculated action but its on the gather intelligence section, it's so rip rn
---
Got the masterworked trust so I will be using that. Don‚Äôt have Luna‚Äôs yet because I can‚Äôt stand doing comp alone. 1/3 of the way through heroic 3.
---
That is fucking incredible üòÇüòÇ
---
&gt; All crucible matches go till the timer hits 0. Just because shaxx declares a match over doesn't mean anything, you can keep going. It's been this way since launch, though shaxx hasn't always preemptively called matches in the same way he does now.
---
Did you watch the clip?
---
in shibe: chimken nuggers 
---
Add this to the 10+ reasons that crucible is hot cancer and absolutely tilting to play even a single game. 
---
Probably why I love it so much 
---
I realized after I posted it I meant to say VOID BOMB instead of NOVA BOMB
---
Moving on from Nova Warp has been hard. They massacred our boy... 
---
I'd say it's the same 50-odd sweatys with dust rock/lunas, and then probably 50 blueberries that end up on my team with their auto rifles. 
---
Noticed they do this to the drifter sometimes when waiting for transmat in gambit. Honestly looks rad, i wish this could be an option. You know, just in case you dont feel like wearing a full robe on the scorching surface of mercury. Gotta get a draft going on down there sometimes.

TOP
---
but I'd you kill the high value target w/ little to no help, those motes should be for whoever killed it, also bc it can help get a large blocker quick
---
Ah, true. I guess I thought the shader was unique to curated rolls. I don‚Äôt raid often but have a curated from Last Wish which is currently my only source of the shader. I don‚Äôt use the weapon since it simply isn‚Äôt my first choice for an auto rifle in the special slot, so I find myself considering dismantling for the shader. If I can get the shader via other means, all the better. 
---
Oof. That happened to me as well on like my second match of gambit. 
---
I've got a pretty decent BD in my vault but i can't remember the rolls on it
---
Nope :) luckily you can get them from the event,raid or person or drop in certain areas and chests. They drop from the weapons of those things. 
---
Yes! You can also shoot the sword in the middle of a warlock rift to destroy it.
---
&gt; As far as extra charges go, bottom tree solar hunter with spathe is my favorite.
---
You mean top tree, for crucible, right?
---
Is no one else having a seizure trying to watch this? lol.
---
there was stoopees last week
---
&gt; Projectiles could launch like jotunn
---
No please no more of this broken auto aim shit. 
---
Great for PVP if you can get the outlaw and kill clip to proc you'll be shredding.
---
Sadly, you are probably right
---
 But the moon IS haunted.
---
Lunas Hooowl is that scary haunting sound you hear!!
---
I didn't mean for it to track like jotunn! Please God no that would not be good if this thing had a fast fire rate! I just meant that the projectiles could be animated like a purple jotunn shot or something of the sorts.
---
thank you for verifying that for me. I'm looking forward to getting it.
---
What pulse rifle is that?
---
Damn, sorry man. Reminds me of our meatball Kill. I supered and used the last of my heavy and brought it down to the same sliver of health before dying while we had an invader on the field. I remember staring at the sliver praying I wouldn‚Äôt hear that terrible primeval health heal sound and someone on the team would tickle it with their primary and give us the victory. Luckily someone did, and we won. Good luck, guardian!
---
The original that I saw was from D1, priceless at the time.
---
I stand corrected.  
---
If you're ever in the opposing team in a match I'm playing, you're the devil. But a devil I want on my team.
---
Well best luck to you 
---
You're the devil. But a devil I want on my team.
---
Well best luck to you
---
That's a lot of Anarchy
---
The bottom picture is for the Dawning tho. Am I missing something. 
---
Nice dude, what weapon did you use?
---
No I just forgot to put it in the upcoming
---
Needs Luna Howl 
---
Ah
---
Welp, no turning back now.
---
Sweet
---
It's 1 roll away from absolute best roll.
---
It's not "god roll" but it's as close as its gonna get.
---
Queen, kindled, bite of the fox
---
Felt disgusting killing with queens but desperate times need desperate measures lol
---
And then find out it has been nerfed, üò°
---
&gt; Right, lets "fix" the problem by handing players a free exotic on a silver platter.
---
&gt; The only thing that needs fixing here, is your lack of dedication. You struggled a bit,
---
You need to learn how to read. I don't mind dedication, I don't mind struggling when its legitimate. Ascendant challenges and eggs are a PITA, but I'm not complaining. Hell even the autorifle challenges that people seem to bitch about aren't that hard. The problem I have is going 3 matches in a row down players against a full coherent team, players going AFK as soon as an event starts, and other problems related to the people in the game not the game itself. A multiplayer game doesn't work with out the player part.
---
Suck it up sounds like the advice of someone that's happy they paid full price for Fo76.
---
Haha well you can see my psn, hmu sometimes 
---
I've posted this before but I'll summarise again:
---
One of the biggest issues with OEM, apart from the fact that the buffs it gives are way too good, and no other (or at least, few other) exotics provide such a bonus, is the fact that it actively discourages muscle memory plays. 
---
Destiny is about teamshots, as you said. Even if you're about to die in a 1v1, you want to at least hit the other guy to make him weaker for your team to clean up. 
---
The issue with OEM is that, as you've described, unless you KNOW you can get the kill, attacking him in ANY way is actually more harmful than helpful. 
---
In your situation, the OEM titan sneaking up on you with shotty, and you react a millisecond too slow and only damage him, he'll get bonus health and bonus damage just for killing you. 
---
Or say you see a guy peek, you get a shot off on him reflexively. Now you HAVE to win this fight or he gets overshields and damage boost. 
---
You have to actively identify his equipment mid-engagement, and actively avoid damaging him unless you can get the kill with a guarantee. 
---
This is objectively unfair, broken, and goes against how any other shooting game works, hands down. 
---
It's also not just a problem at higher ranks because at lower ranks, people don't know how to counter it well. I'm at around 1800 glory and see 2/8 minimum OEM users per game. 
---
happens because ally is perfectly on top of you and its like you're slamming into a wall at mach 9
---
&gt; Ok to clarify nearly every super on the hunter is OP even with the nerf, BB can not be stopped by anything and will shutdown every super, spectral blades is nearly invincible while invisible, arc staff is gonna send your bullets right back at you.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Hunters jump is by far better than any other in the game with or without exotics.
---
&gt; Hunters also have some of the best exotics in shards, gwisin vest, stomp ees, ( and others but I‚Äôm in the car driving). 
---
THESE ALL RELATE TO SUPERS THOUGH. SUPERS ARE MEANT TO BE GOOD. 
---
OEM is active ALL GAME. 
---
That looks amazing!
---
Any advice on getting basic stuff to the front page? Thanks guys. 
---
&gt; Will it take a while to get to 2100?
---
Yes. Unless you're actively sweating with clan/teammates, you will get rolled over by OTHER people who are sweating with clan/teammates. Be prepared for a lot of 500-1000 Glory users somehow using NF/lunas. 
---
Ahh, you‚Äôre a queen user. Well 31 kills is still a lot even with queen breaker so I‚Äôll over look that. But congrats man, it‚Äôs a great feeling.
---
give me one dude
---
More like sorry to drifter. He's disappointed
---
Just shut up and take my money.
---
This is super common.  
---
Of you were paired in content with a warlock, would you rather them be attunement of grace with phoenix protocol or attunement of control with geomags?
---
Nvidia Shadow Play is always recording. It's just whether you hit save or not.
---
Xur didn't have Luna's last week.
---
&gt; Idk Im an extremely mid tier crucible player and no one has hit me with it.
---
Then you haven't yet played against it. It's incredibly easy to get kills with. It beats out supers because you can pop from a corner, release it, and pop back into cover. 
---
You're incorrect. I've seen loads of the shots. Dozens of them.
---
Is that why hunters are still the far crucible majority and titans are the minority on console?
---
AND PUT THAT TELESTO AWAAAY
---
Let me re-iterate - you're judging the balance on a mode DESIGNED AROUND SPAMMING SUPERS. This isn't neutral play. 
---
Nice Parcel of Stardust. Is it a god roll?
---
Wow so double teaming somebody and failing or running away and hiding won‚Äôt work for you anymore? Shame
---
Okay, then you've been lucky, or you're lying. There's no way you've been shot at, and dodged 30+ shots. Also, thanks for downvoting, hilarious that you think internet karma points mean jack shit. 
---
Considering it does nothing unless you try to hide in a corner or somebody already died to them it‚Äôs pretty easy to counter, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt shotgun them then evade backwards and hide in a corner anymore plz nerf‚Äù
---
Take my mf money
---
Greens the new gold
---
I used that helmet and threw Nova bomb into a group of taken and literally got my super back immediately. My friend is pissed at me. I keep getting the stuff he wants. I got contraverse hold with enhanced impact induction. That really set him off üòÇ
---
so greedy, bet you kept them all to yourself too!
