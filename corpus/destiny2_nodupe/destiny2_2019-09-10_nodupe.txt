Damn, be a little more respectful my guy.

Well dang it. I got really excited. I can’t tell you how many times I ran Wrath of the Machine and never got the ship.

I feel ya buddy. *looks at the slot for my last missing D1 Y3 exotic - Vex Mythoclast*
---
What gun is that?
---
But what major advantage does that give you
---
I'm stuff
---
Nah I’m good
---
It's an armor 2.0 mod
---
my vault is full of random shit just like d1 n i hate my self oh now that i think about it i guess i can remove ever y1 stuff
---
Well I mean the point of TLW is to always hip fire it, but I get what you mean.
---
I looked it up and i have one more question. You cant get all these weapons still right?

You can I believe, all the quests are still available at their respective vendors, I just yesterday got my Luna’s howl
---
Same. I'd prefer him over Nolan.
---
I had potato ass hip fire aim when I used it in D1. I was always used to aiming down sights with it until it came back in D2. I got more used to hip fire. Otherwise, it’s still a little clunky like most hand cannons.
---
Xol definitely should require you to get those crits on his side or use the javelin to unlock a damage phase.
---
Agreed.
---
Ok awesome thank you
---
If u wanna slide around a corner with a shotgun you can know wether they're right around the corner or several meters back, or if you're hardscoping with a sniper you can know exactly when they're gonna peak so you can get the headshot, what situation would a radar benefit you over tracking?
---
r/lostredditors?

LuNiFiCaTiOn idk why but it pisses me off when ppl say it like that

what?

Why is this posted on a destiny sub?

I use wells exclusively for PvP. Rip lunafaction fighting lion well of radiance spam :(

Sometimes if we are quick we eat them before they explode. They taste like sunshine.

There can be mild cases or severe cases of ocd, instead of talking to people with severe ocd and assuming that is the only kind of ocd out there, try reading a book.

Damn i got it yesterday after my first run little bit over 100k

Nah let him rest. Plus we have his gun so we’re carrying his legacy.

I normally run either Luna's or Outlast when I'm using Revoker

I'm throwing swords? I thought I was throwing flames from a sword

I’m actually mad because you’re not dressed as a hand cannon either 😤

oh god i feel sad now because youre dad is doing the prophecy weapons this was the most cancer thing in grind in CoO
---
"No. Have Uldren instead"
---
Same lol, not working on the gambit prime boss
---
He's changed his programming before. He changed it during the collapse. Instead of helping and protecting humanity after the collapse, he went silent and instead turned to self preservation. He sees guardians and humanity as a means to stay alive. He's just like the drifter, cept the drifter is upfront about being a back stabber.
---
I was always disappointed there wasnt a unique melee for the Monte Carlo
---
Oh ya, for sure PC is generally the superior gaming platform but not necessarily strictly better. If you have a 17 year old Xbox Live account like I do, you'll end up with a couple thousand friends. It's really hard to just drop that community for somewhat better performance and needing to learn all over again how to use the tools of the platform; mouse, keyboard vs controller. The same would be true if I played PC games the past 17 years lol. 
---
I definitely don't want to even think about upgrading my PC anytime a new game comes out, a good PC is already expensive. My alienware laptop cost me $3k and it's already a few years old. There's a lot of little things that add up too, but it's really just sticking with your community of friends and not needing to master the tools of a new platform. I don't wanna have to relearn mouse and keyboard for a shooter when I'm already very good with a controller.
---
I'm not asking for much, just a handful of basic controller options that actually already common to other console shooters
---
That's pretty opulent
---
Congrats now pair it with mountaintop and enjoy being toxic in pvp
---
I own destiny 2 on PlayStation but not on PC and I’m wanting to transfer to PC
---
Taken Captains really need to be tuned. There needs to be some sort of cooldown for each of their abilities. They're either rapid blinking, rapid firing their shotguns with perfect accuracy from 50 meters, or spamming shadowbolts that BLIND you.
---
I'm jealous, that's not only a nice cake, but also looks yummy!
---
Happy birthday :3
---
Oh yeah, that’s happened to me numbers of times. We’ll win, it will show we Victory, then the other team will get like 2 kills and win instead of us. Stupid lol
---
It’s not letting me buy it for PC on any of the websites
---
Actually letting titans join from lfg for raids
---
*shit* you got me in a box here.
---
Storm trance so we can get little buddies from my rift :D
---
Hey, I was nine back then too!
---
Tarrabah perk is slightly faster. I believe it can kill in one less shot than recluse and fires at the same speed.
---
if you do the bounties 3 times a day its not hard really.
---
Why? Do you dislike public events?
---
I saw an old guy at my work. At least 60-70 years old. Wearing a destiny shirt. And yes he plays. I asked
---
This can’t be real
---
Not to be that guy. But you don't even know the pain of getting Mountaintop before the buff
---
I mean it's not really stealing anything. I saw this exact glitch on this subreddit a year ago, and I remember doing it.
---
Is it coming back?
---
I find it interesting
---
Yeah true that, hard to tell when glitches are just stolen from someone else
---
r/unexpectedmhw
---
And they say Destiny doesn't have enough content.
---
The pve parts of gambit function more or less like all other pve. The difference is that power level advantages are disabled. 
---
Power level advantages are *en*abled for the pvp part, though.
---
Take my upvote you bastard.
---
So with graviton lance and it’s buff should be stronger in gambit against the combatants not the guardians, right?
---
I think of them as sword blades, because they are sort of shaped like that, but I guess they are just made of fire. 
---
Then again, is the sword you hold in your hands during the super just made of fire?
---
Wait the fuck what? A buff to grav lance in pve, thats coolio. But I feel like it would affect gambit (just the pve part though)
---
Well im hoping thats how it will work but idk if it does
---
So the buff at shadowkeep will apply?
---
That is correct. Pve buffs affect pve, pvp buffs affect pvp. Some buffs affect both modes, and you can tell this by reading what the buff or nerf actually says in the patch notes on the bungie website.
---
I don’t use shotgun I use revoker/lunas or redrix/beloved
---
Huh, mine have been different. You mustve been lucky or something. And your experience proves that it should just be able to be gotten from the collections as a curated roll
---
I took away my upvote not gonna lie.
---
Your first ever it seems
---
It hadn't even crossed my mind but now that you mentioned it, why the hell is there no statue of Cayde in the tower??
---
If it shares the rpm of an archetype it generally has a set in stone impact.
---
Possibly Golgoroth, or maybe that EP boss that looks like him. Could also be a demogorgon from stranger things.
---
Bro I'm never playing Destiny again this joke has taken it to far
---
As much as I like Cayde, I'm against this. We can't kill characters off and then just bring them back.
---
They don't have randomized perks. You can tell what possible perks guns and armor can have using third party database sites such as light.gg
---
If you couldnt tell by me backing away from b, I was flipping the freak out.
---
I disagree, raid sets should be thematic to the raid, in this case vex themes. However I do agree that Bungie dropped the ball by offering a reskin as an end game reward in an eagerly awaited expansion. No issue with eververse armour being good, at the end of the day it's there as extra income and for players to continue to support Bungie/ the game. As stock is cosmetic only (As it should be) they need to be attractive otherwise no one will by them. Not to say attractive NEW options shouldn't be available from other activity based sources.
---
Warlocks when they get phalanxed
---
If you can hold your own in reckoning without having to use well then good on you, but I swear to god it’s the most frustrating thing to watch a warlock fire his entire electric cumshot into a wall and die rather than just bite the bullet and use Well. I’m sick of using tether too but the sooner we get these runs over with the sooner we can go actually play the game.
---
Hey, your chin feels nice.
---
I like it better when You Fallen....and can't get up.
---
Liars Handshake with 1 2 Punch..... literally strongest DPS burst in game. I’m a Warlock main btw. We have it the worst
---
Me too!
---
Is this just d2 characters because I don't see any of first games raid bosses
---
Theeeeeerre it is. Warlocks. Liars handshake aren’t consistent. That’s why no one really uses it.
---
Not even close to worst but k
---
Pub-stomping.
---
Destiny is designed for elitist no-lifers. Pinnacle, op weapons are available only to the most dedicated (read 8+ hours of play a day) then they come to quick play to improve their ever important k/d.
---
See through walls.... sorry I had to
---
What's wrong? You punched the hell out of them!
---
You asked for an example and I provided one. You can also go back a year and see how long Wormhusk was a thing, I’m sure people found hunters annoying then.
---
Titans have that and with 2 other added benefits. Try again.
---
Wormhusk wasn’t nearly as busted as some of the shit titans and warlocks can do
---
flawless execution? golden gun? reflective arc staff? stompees / dragons shadow? their jump? blade barrage counters anything?
---
Broadsword was my first pinnacle weapon too, I thought the same way you do. Now I have Recluse and Luna. If I can get them you can too. Have faith in yourself!
---
Tractor Cannon can launch his ass pretty far but his fall is so slow.
---
Thanks, my very next game was a kill farm for snipers. 5 on 3, camping spawn points. 
---
I put the controller down.
---
Nah ive been plating pretty hard the past month or so actually and hadnt gotten anything up until now
---
What are the stats?
---
You know, that makes a lot of sense.
---
Nah, it's probably because it's a billion times easier to afk on pc than console. Just set up a quick macro and you're good to go.
---
This is sadly a  common bug that's been around since launch and one of the reasons why I can't wait to migrate to Steam, Battlenet does that garbage a lot and the quickest solution would be to delete your D2 directory completely and redownload everything from scratch.
---
HOWEVER, here's a fix that usually works if the downloader gets stuck on Initializing, I had to do this myself once and it went through:
---
First off, close Bnet entirely. Move or rename your D2 directory (DO NOT delete it, we're just make the program think the folder is not there anymore). Restart Bnet and click download on your Destiny 2 tab, it will then start a fresh download from scratch. Wait a few seconds until Bnet is actually downloading. When it is, completely close Bnet again, go to your D2 directory, and swap the new directory Bnet has just created with your old one you moved/renamed. Upon restarting Bnet it should check for files and notice your directory is there, and resume the download from there. 
---
If this doesn't work, I'm afraid you'll have to delete everything and restart the download from scratch.
---
All that for 7 motes.  -Thanos
---
he is the wisest and at the same time the derpiest lizard i've ever seen
---
DONT TOUCH IT!  
---
Trust me. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
If it takes too long, open up your task manager and see if its still downloading or checking your game files. Other than that, just let it do its job
---
Oh, you mean use the rally barricade inside of a WoR? Yeah, if you bunch up like that then someone's blowing themselves up with they GL for sure...
---
Guardian...You need to throw more grenades!!! Bwahaahaaaa! Nice drawing👍🙂
---
Need frends for raid
---
Queued into a rumble match and 3 others were rocking double nades. Definitely one of the easier rumble matches ive played. Also makes me upset since I honestly wish you didnt have to be godly with a GL do go on decent kill streaks. 
---
Is it weird that id like to be scared of seeing double gl loadouts and not think “easy win”?
---
nani??
---
The tower one : the floor is lava
---
The farm one: start by running a bit on the water wheel for buff 1, from there walk over all the cables inbetween buildings for buff 2, final buff is received from doing the time trial checkpoint thing started at the fireplace near the water
---
Do you have higher res? I would like to set this as my wallpaper.
---
What does this do?
---
This looks like when Vegeta did the self destruct thing with Majin Buu
---
I wouldn't use smgs in crucible, unless it's recluse. Also scouts unless you've got a box breathing no feelings
---
So your logic is: All other stuff from Titans is bonkers, but when Titans get on ridiculously overpowered thing, it balances out?
---
Does not make sense, tbh. The real solution would be to have balanced and versatile build options across the board, not one build you are shoe-horned into.
---
Did we just slaughter 300 million hive, yes 
---
Did we just kill a hive worm god 300k times, yes
---
Did we kill a hive worms gods worshipper 320k times, yes

Footage of my dumbass friend who uses chaperone and recluse
---
Yeah, i usually switch to PG when the supers start rolling in comp so i can crush a super that wouldve lasted for ages with a single melee button press. Next to that i also use supression grenades that would make the hong kong police proud.
---
Golden gun has no super armor
---
  
---
Won't argue about spectral
---
Tether takes to long to deploy after being shot, and honestly the only people i have seen running it are people farming mountaintop kills.
---
Since I’m out of school, it’ll become social life
---
thing with supression grenades and perirgine is the nades can be dodged and you have a super yeet the smol titan away
---
In my game I am the chosen one, I'm the hero of the red war, the one to defeat Oryx, and to kill riven. And anyone who was in my fireteam was just that, unnamed guardians who were the heros of the red war's fireteam members. 
---
But from the perspective of anyone of my teammates, they are the hero of the red war. 
---
This is why when we read the quest descriptions it like we are the first to do said thing. The player character was the first to make malfeasance, recreate a thorn, and reforge the thorn into lumina. All the other players are just other guardians following in our footsteps. Hence why the drifter says everyone and their grandma has made a malfeasance by now.
---
Tl:dr think of it like looking back in history. You are the chosen one and everyone else is just random guardians, because in time the name of the hero will be lost and it doesn't matter who they were, but the story is being told from their perspective.
---
Superblack should return as Vantablack

If need be I’ll be your hunter punching bag
---
My therapist says it’s an unhealthy coping mechanism, but she also thinks punk is dead so what does she know?
---
this is true. I think they toned it down a BIT much. They should have halved them instead of thirds but kept the comp X3 points. 
---
I mean, it doesn't bother me that much. I feel like mountaintop is only crucible god tier when it's in the hands of an already skilled player. it's all about that MT/Recluse combo for PvE.
---
Can we please get dinklebot back
---
Ching chong your opinion is wrong
---
Betttt
---
Opponents tend to jump when they see you have a grenade launcher and if your in the air you don’t have to flick up you can get your first shot as a direct hit
---
That wizard came from the moon
---
I think you meant Kings Horn
---
I wish we still had THE Dinklage mans made the game sounds that much more serious and eerie
---
Bonus points: FL/Quickdraw primary starves Apes!
---
That is true but Titan barriers drain your health pretty fast so it might have ended in a trade
---
I see what people like about Nolan and he definitely brings life to the series, but Dinklebot's detached delivery really helped sell the mood of Destiny for me.
---
Spoken like a true titan
---
No
---
I said that comp was broken and got downvoted...
---
u/Vredditdownloader
---
I finished every crucible pinnacle weapon this season aside from NF (well I'm about 20 precision HC kills from Luna's), and I'm not tired of PvP as much as Im tired of comp.
---
Rumble will be my preference at least until shadowkeep.

Beloved no distractions
---
To much effort to use that item...
---
It may be the class you're playing. Each one has a different jump. My main is a hunter, I love triple jump. I don't like the warlock jump though.
---
*GOTTA BLAST* LOL
---
What’s wrong with lord of the wolves?
---
Definitely prefer Dinklebot over the current Ghost. His sedated delivery made it easy to ignore the terrible dialogue, but Nolan North just accentuates it. Especially in 2.
---
I didn’t say there was something wrong with it. My point was that Lord of Wolves would’ve been more effective here than your Super.
---
Oh yeah true
---
I found out when I reached somewhat-endgame, that is have to get a pass if I want to experience the whole game. So I set it down.
---
Haha, look at that Titan...with...eh, not one but...2 eyes. *nervous shaking*
---
Thankfully I’m seeing less and less Warlocks using Well now in different activities and I’m happy about that cos people should be able to use whatever super they want. It’s about having fun, not being forced to use a power u hate or find boring
---
Strike specific drops that drop in playlist strikes pleeeeeaaaasssseee. A la D1
---
The Dead Orbit ideology revolves around the idea that the Traveler is dead. It ain't.
---
I would get an austringer with outlaw and rampage for PvE because drop mag in pve is not really that good
---
Ace of Spades, Trust, Duke, Last Word and Spare Rations are on my rotation as of right now.
---
Oof. Free +5 shards though
---
Doesn't it? But, we'd need bigger maps to compensate for the number of people and to help with bad speaking. Maybe establish faction specific spawn areas in these maps where none of the other teams can enter or do damage to anyone?
---
Emphasis on the word opinion
---
People forget that everyone is different and they all like different things. They never seem to remember that.
---
Oh, what's that? Your opinion in a totally subjective topic is different from mine? You are the enemy of the people. 
---
That's how I imagine they sound like
---
Like the others mentioned, you have to use a power weapon (anything in the heavy slot). I always farm mine from Escalation Protocol on Mars.
---
As a player who sorely misses ammo synths, this is something I'd support.
---
use the pc discord lfg, don’t use the app.. it’s way better and has way more people from eu and na
---
Soloing Crota for the first time, I felt like I was the best destiny player in the world, still one of my favorite gaming moments of all time.
---
It’s nice for boss phase. Knock shield down one super. Get it right back and just repeat super over and over until their all dead. 
---
The physics are just nuts though.
---
I feel you, been there with gally

Your submission has been removed in violation of Rule 5 - Read the FAQ.
---
There are a numerous amount of very commonly asked questions about Destiny 2, which we continue to see multiple times a day. Please refer to the F.A.Q or utilise the subreddit search function before asking question as it's more than likely that your question has been answered before.
---
Correct it’s a boss rotation not an activity if that makes sense
---
Mmm i like that idea. Give people there own faction specific spawn room and make it unavailable to others to get into. The idea of having a 4v4v4 with factions tho is just so nice. I feel like people could really get into representing there factions with that
---
It has a flame on it. Isn‘t that a power weapon?
---
Thanks.
---
Bounty states that u have to use power weapons (weaps in power weapon slot) to defeat powerful enemy :) Best is to jump to the mars and do 2 escal protocols or something like that. U got tons of powerful enemies there. Machuneguns/grenade launchers and rocket lunchers r probly best to pwn em :))
---
while dinklebots delivery was flat the new ghost takes all seriousness and gravity out of every moment I feel.  it's the snarky comic relief all the damn time and nothing feels serious or dark for it.  with dinklebot the subdued seriousness made finding the hive and exploring the moon feel more serious, the the new guy made it feel like I was dragging around a 10 year old with an 'ooo what's that' attitude all the time.
---
And heavy ammo synths
---
Opps! All *T I T A N S*
---
Drang is an Energy weapon (middle slot).  Power weapons are in the bottom slot.
---
yes the new season as cross platform, but annual pass from y2 isn’t
---
The Red War kind of disproved that hypothesis
---
Fought like a true Titan!
---
“Good grenades” This made me laugh
---
That is, I will not receive anything for buying the game and the DLCs even if they are free, and I still need to buy the extensions to have the minimum of new content?
---
Yeet
---
The perk I forgot the name but when you kill something the arrow explodes and kills everything else tethered or at least damage but I forgot the name
---
Forget Shadowkeep this is what the Traveler should fear
---
Base game, Osiris and warmind.You get gambit and locations from forsaken but not gear , sub classes or exotic quests
---
I'm just sayin, I think we would all be better of if we just worked together.
---
I’d rather have anyone other than Nolan North voicing your ghost. One of the most dialogue heavy characters in the game and they get the most overused VA in the industry to voice them. Regardless of how you see Dinklage’s performance, at least it was something unique instead of yet another Nolan North/Troy Baker performance.
---
&gt;a direct hit with this gun and it NOT kill someone
---
thank god i thought it was just me.
---
It really depends on what perks that sniper has. If it has opening shot it likely gave him the headshot on the first guy even though he was a bit off. If he's running a sniper rifle targeting perk, it would also give him more forgiveness.
---
Should this be a good thing? I don't remember buying a game in early access
---
Hold up, that ain't no bottom tree striker. What is this?
---
It’s a good combo gun that takes primary ammo
---
If you hit someone with it you can either finish them off with a fight or decommission them from a fight for like a few seconds
---
You may not win 1v1duels with it, but that’s not the intended play style. But if you get your angles right it can fuck people up
---
Nope I think that's the one dlc I'm missing
---
No clue, tbh. 
---
Maybe use an aim trainer to improve aiming ... or there is always the option to cave in and accept your destiny. In the end, there has to be someone at the bottom of the food chain. It is not much, but it is honest work and people at the bottom make people on top happy.
---
But I seriously wondered how to improve, and I have no really good idea there. A training mode would be nice.
---
The boss loot pool is is locked and my understanding is there is a very small % chance for any other drop. But this is bungie so anything is possible I guess
---
Static vendors.
---
What you got, was supporting a developer and allowing them to make a great game that so many enjoy.
---
We are not entitled to anything at all because we bought the game, we do not retroactively get our money back and we dont get anything unless bungie feels like giving us something.
---
**clears throat**
---
Duck horn.
---
Maybe. The very nature of competitive being a rat race of who inputs the most time is turning me off, though.
---
So while I would like to improve, I realise that everyone else would like to as well and that, in the end, either forces me to improve faster than others (which I might not, given real-life time constraints like kids and gf) or accept that there has to be a bottom of the food chain.
---
Which is fine. I love the PvE-part of Destiny.
---
one of my strongest loadouts for console is the ol' snipe lion build, or FL and an SMG
---
Yeah but it's all about that strike specific loot
---
I feel like this will be my experience, but man the idea of lfg for comp gives me anxiety. I'm about half way through solar kills for Lunas so I might just focus on finishing that and precision kills before next season and go for fabled then as they made it more forgiving.
---
They said in future seasons after undying
---
I stopped at same time and trying to find some infos. I have base game + 2 DLCs. Do you found some info about?
---
We need to buy forsaken and annual pass? English is my secondary language, I can't understand many things...
---
They give you dreaming city gear if you shoot them with wish ender. If you shoot all 40 throughout dreaming city then it's part of the curse breaker title
---
I'm not even grinding mountaintop, The fighting lion never comes off.
---
Omg I can't stop laughing.... what does the guy keep yelling? I can't make it out
---
It's from a lanyard they sold at Target. I have that on my keys.
---
When a titan joins a group what are you going to tell them to play? After shadowkeep i bet it will be bubble. All of the other subclasses are mediocre as it stands and the only semi useful one is getting nerfed (melting point) 
---
Im not saying Well will not have a use. im saying people are only going to play bubble titan if they are using for raids like they did in D1.
---
The first wird i think hes saying before yeeting that rock is granate which is german for you guessed it: Grenade
---
no BUT after Sept. 17, (if I'm remembering correctly from a previous TWAB) people who purchase Forsaken will also receive the Annual Pass content from Y2 (Black Armory, Joker's Wild, and Penumbra)
---
i use kepris sting to get instant wall hacks at the start of the maps and snipe the obvious one eyed
---
i use lucky pants to get the first shot with my HC killing them quite fast there after
---
i use knucklehead to see them coming for me swap to my shotgun and shotgun them
---
i use oatkeeper for infinite poison hold monarch to poison the mand do extra perfect hold damage so they loose over half their health i swap to my quickdraw smg and finish them off
---
Yeah, I recognized it from there
---
I don’t have any trouble finding raids
---
Punk isn't dead it just smells that way ha ha.
---
If you're using a sniper they're going to be out of radar range, you'll have no way of knowing if they're going to peek, and if if they're charging at you from the bright red of the radar, the radar will stay the same color until their on top of you and by then it's too late
---
I effing love chaos reach when I’m in a vocal chat I just scream “KAMEHAMEHA!!!”
---
Console: we don’t need bloom or recoil to make HC’s balanced!
---
PC: *exclusively uses HC’s*
---
He means what are the options for use, rotates what you can use in each slot and a modifier weekly.
---
wait what? I thought it was just going up to 2 a run?
---
I use one for PvP &amp; PvE, it doesn’t have the best range for Kinect slot but I love it. I’d say try for one and see how it feels for you.

I personally only agree to the extent of raid gear. At least for hunters, most armor looked samey to me. The only notable ones were the faction helmets (but all 3 were reskins of the same one besides the ones I had to use dust for). As a whole I surprisingly like the variety d2 gives me, I do miss my guns however.

Did he die eventually?

Kinetic: Anything

Energy: Fusion Rifle

Power: Fusion Rifle

I’ve done something similar but it was while defusing a point in countdown as last guardian standing. Finished in the last second before death. Felt like a hero, a very cowardly hero
---
I agree, but I prefer FWC over the space fascists and Emo's R' us
---
Throw it in the trash. Titan Life! Lol good find though mate!
---
Dinklage sucked; no range.
---
i too, am a goblin
---
What are we farmin??
---
Confirmed. This works. I transferred from my Xbox to PC not knowing that I needed to buy forsaken on my PC first. Bought the Cdkeys code and put it in, now I have access to forsaken! Thanks!
---
I think the dodges that grant melee energy or reload should consume a charge, but a regular dodge should still be available.
---
Everyone seems to forget just how good the hunters neutral game is.  A skilled hunter is unpredictable and hard to track.
---
I havent touched it and it still says the same thing
---
I hope you're right because I haven't done it yet, but they previously haven't so as not to lock out activities that people have already paid for when a new expansion comes out. It was a big to-do when warmind came out and people could no longer do nightfalls that they could before. There won't be any stragglers now, so we shall see.
---
Yes sir. True story
---
I got a few good ones but that ramen one and the colonol look awesome.
---
The cloak dodge disagree.
---
Drops increase by 1 every Friday.
---
I’d like Nolan to do the ghost like he did in Forsaken, less energetic and all that
---
Yeah, that's what I meant. You need to kill 5 guys within 5 secs of each other and then you can throw like two times max.
---
exactly, most (if not all) the hand cannons are, not sure why you got downvoted but its so true.
---
I’d be down to help you out! I’ve 2 manned it before, we’d just need one other person who knows what they’re doing.
---
You’ll get boosted up to 750 power on October 1st, so if you want to do it then you’ll actually be able to kill enemies
---
Can you explain it like I’m mentally slow? Is it going to be 2 drops a run until Friday? Then it’s 3 drops a run. Then Friday after it’s 4 etc?
---
Lies
---
Thanks, but I’ll wait until I get bumped up, and then talk some friends into it.
---
Bingo.
---
But those are psions

Lmao as another aussie who has never played D1 I can confirm that is what I thought of.
