Had it drop from crucible and almost sharded it before I realized what power I possessed
---
Now I can come back from Nessus and not be broke
---
ohh ok thx
---
wait how do i do that
---
The cap was raised to 30 and some content was opened up for free. I believe all year one content was opened up. You more than likely own vanilla, curse of Osiris and warmind. You’re lacking forsaken and the season pass content.
---
I got Anarchy first time ever stepping into any raid so I know about that.
---
Same. I also got a random version at the same time, but it wasn’t a good roll.
---
The max level is 50 and I’m pretty sure it’s for everyone , you just need to have dlc to do the new activities within those dlc’s
---
TBF I have no clue all I know is that a few of the weekly or major posts use a setup like that and it’s easy to skim through. Maybe asking one of the guys who’s made a table style post could help but other than that adding the full names would help.
---
They can drop from solstice boxes once you hit purple
---
i did
---
You’re breathtaking🙏
---
#OH YES GUARDIAN
---
The short answer: year 1 content is going free to play in September. For the time being, to prevent people from buying DLC and not being able to play it until the game goes free, the year 1 content is included with every Forsaken purchase for free.
---

---
You could buy the "complete collection" through the official store for your platform. This is $40 for both Forsaken and the annual pass.
---
You could buy the "legendary edition" and get just Forsaken from third party vendors. The annual pass sold separately from official vendors is $15, but you can't play it without Forsaken.
---
[This is a somewhat common question,](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/search?q=how+buy+forsaken&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) the comments to these past posts may help. I was unable to find one single search term that would get every result, but combinations like "where buy forsaken," "buy forsaken" "purchase forsaken" etc. also bring up a variety of past posts.
---
You said you don't have time. And the game changes a few months. Well the armor hasn't been changed since Forsaken.
---
Do you have any in red?
---
I saw melee, assist, assist, snipe, snipe, assist and then stopped watching.
---

The power level of the solstice armor is based on your level, not power level. It should be 700.

Wait then do blessings and armor stack then? This is so exciting.
---
I requested to join a group that said +1.0 kd and on my request I said I don’t have a 1.0 kd then I was accepted and accused of lying
---
No you’re breathtaking
---
Do the 40 for breakneck have to be the normal 2 match gambit or will it take gambit prime matches too?
---
just turn the controller off
---
Uhhhh....
---
The well was ruining the game.
---
So, basically, you want Warlocks to have ONLY ONE useful Super? Great, Hunters get 3 or 4, Titans have a couple and Warlocks get fucking one
---
Ghost problem?
---
Who ya gonna call...
---
But Spectrals isn't?
---
Would be cool to watch them slam a well and a bubble then do the fusion emote
---
ok?
---
You’re alone on that. Well is an end-all be-all super. It’s op. It needs a nerf.
---
No problem baby titan. If you're on Xbox join for punchy times
---
Foetracer continues to be slept on
---
So they're an actual sniper. Get over it.
---
Somebody tell DestinyFunPolice... his videos will be even better!
---
Does anyone if i reach fable with one of my characters to the rest also reach it?
---
I mean it wouldn't be very effective as a Warlock to stand still with their arms up for a few minutes before they can super
---
Why not remove Warlock altogether then? Since everyone complains every damn 
---
#SUPER
---
Warlocks have is apparently OP what's next Chaos Reach? That has a time nerf? Geomag doesnt do anything? Stormcaller has significantly less range?
---
Hardscoping isn't for COD only, it's simply a term for people who are patient and don't pull out of scope between shots. also, please read up on the definition of Sniping.
---
It does not violate the game rules or break the terms of service, so yeah, it IS a playstyle and a very common one in any game that has any sort of pvp activity. learn how to deal with it
---
you literally just made yourself the clown of the day! congratulations Mr Giggles
---
The removal of strength intellect and discipline has remained one of the biggest disappointments for me. That and the fact that for some reason a majority of the warlock outfits look like ass. I miss my old chroma Spektar Haliaetus Hood and as well as my dope ass days of iron set. The sets are kinda getting better but still only a select few are actually good looking imo.
---
What would be a benefit to run bottom tree over top tree?
---
Run Well/Phoenix Protocol
---
I'm guessing you didn't look it up then?
---
You would have to get into every weapon and find out the number of combinations per weapon, then add them all up.
---
You must be intensely bored.
---
I came to hate Titans even more after leveling mine up and jumping into Crucible for a few days. Mostly just strikers though. That super is so busted, OEM is busted too. With a bunch of super mods on, I was just going for a casual stroll and wiping out the other team in the process. People complained about spectral and wormhusk but they weren't nearly this bad.
---
THAT BEING SAID, I'm very much in the anti-nerf crowd and believe Bungie should leave those as is, bring other things in line with it. Mind you, Mayhem is my favourite part of Destiny so I think I just like carnage.
---
Excellent
---
Myelin Games belongs with Byf and you forgot CammyCakes for pvp
---
We desperately need a solo que comp playlist
---
Yeah. That’s really hard.
---
Oh my god it’s been so long.
---
your ass got me excited again
---
You have to buy foresaken with annual pass and you can pre order shadow keep. All year 1 content is free

It's doable, it is a fixed number. It's just a big number.
---
I would totally do the grind for that armor.
---
Yikes. Take a breather.
---
Done !
---
How did you know
---
NICE.
---
I'll just say it. I got Luna's and Recluse the same season entirely because of luck. I kept going up against really bad teams. "Oh, we need to defuse? Let's all rush the arcstrider that popped his super and is emoting on the bomb one at a time!".
---
At that point you BECOME The Traveller.
---
The Boys on Amazon Prime
---
You like to....put a lot....of.....unnecessary.........dots in your posts for some reason. I did not say that ddosing is acceptable behavior and should not be punished by at least bungie. But you like to act like a big baby considering your are going off the word of someone "that is talented in telling someone that they got ddosed".
---
Don’t get me wrong I respect you, six fronts, Sun breakers, it’s all very impressive. But I’m not asking a Titan for help with a math problem.
---
I'm a hunter and used last word and the Ikelos Sniper to get my recluse. I was lucky enough to get a helmet with enhanced HC targeting but since I'm on ps4 I found it \*much\* easier to just hip fire with last word and just body shot at close-medium range. It's a fast ttk, considering. I used spectral but mostly for the invis/true sight you get when you hit a precision shot while crouched. Sometimes those wall hacks were what won games for me. If you don't have ikelos then a quickdraw/snapshot beloved is great, or a supremacy from dreaming city. I also used the Dragon's shadow exotic chestpiece so I could get that bonus movement speed and the instant reload whenever I picked up special. 
---
If you're not a hunter then the best advice I can give would be to use a lift/jump/glide that makes you move fast and therefore a harder target to hit. Most of the time on console PVP enemies will wait for you to hit the ground before they open fire, so getting accustomed to gunning people down while you're airborne will give you a huge advantage (icarus mod helps with this as well). Overall making yourself a harder target to hit and knowing when to retreat and regroup with your team is what can decide matches in your favor.
---
Dang, I don't have Prime. Oh well
---
I don't know how to do the spoiler tags so I will be as vague as I can to avoid spoilers for people that haven't watched. Your second point is definitely valid but I thought your first point was that it was not just a normal person doing that but someone also super powered

Warlock or nothin'
---
that show was actually pretty fucking good
---
Actually you’ll be able to do it next wed, I’m also going from Xbox to PS4
---
You can reacquire old armor that is 2.0. So, in effect, yes.
---
Jokes on them, I have Liar's Handshake so I'm pretty much a titan now.
---
That third guy peeking was a gift. Nice shooting Guardian.
---
I soloed on Xbox. I’m a generally decent player, the one thing I had to do was get great at sniping so I could better support my team.
---
Nope, thats from season 6, xur only drops up to s4
---
the only Tom Clancy games I've played were ghost recon wild lands and the division (first one) the first division seemed pretty good.. but i agree, it got boring quick. i stopped playing before the first dlc even came out. ghost recon though, i think is fun no matter what. it's kinda like gta for me where I can just log on and do whatever I want (cause i don't like the recklessness of gta)
---
I'll give you weapons of light back.
---
To be delivered october 1st.
---
Itll be shipped from a company called Bungie. Dont be fooled, its actually me
---
As a Titan bubble user, I never left.
---
warframe is nowhere near as dog shit as year 1 destiny was. I play both games and fully believe warframe is the superior game. Literally the only reason I even play Destiny is for it's superior pvp.
---
Weapons of light was a perk on Ward of Dawn for Defender Titans in D1. It granted additional weapon damage (about 33% I believe) to anyone who stepped into it and then out of it.
---
There were two other perks (Blessing of Light and Armor of Light) as well. Each did different things.
---
Blessing gave you a 10 sec over shield after you stepped out of it.. and armor gave you crazy damage resistance while inside the bubble.
---
Me having stacks of runes from Iron Banner and comp runs: "It smells like *broke* in here"
---
Why and how do thrall do arc damage. I NEED TO KNOW
---
I have a full page of Edge Transits that I’ve been collecting so that helps
---
My endless curse, aside from almost never getting GHorn to drop.
---
Damn those shards. Damn them good.
---
So you played 1 game of gambit?
---
My gripe is that we don't have nearly as much armor choices in general across all classes. I miss factions from D1 being a thing.
---
Man, everything in this game is mad complex. I don't even know what half the stuff is to begin getting bad juju lol
---
Hello yes could you put me through to
---
Mr. Bungie please?
---
&gt;Warlocks are the best class in the game.
---
I agree.
---
Well, i mean, at least it has two matching traits? That has to count for something?
---
isn't that only for eververse items?
---
They said that everything that you can earn in game will come as 2.0. Faction rally armor was the one thing that they specifically picked out and said there won’t be a 2.0 version.
---
Ok thanks for the explanation
---
Uhhh... I didn't want to infringe copyright?
---
I got mine a while ago, probably the most fun legendary weapon I have so far, now I'm just contemplating on Malfeasance
---
Nice
---
Fuck yeah baby
---
Im already bitchy about slide-shotguns in pvp, i dont need this too.
---
That last photo should be replaced with the caption "yea I just solo qued to legend" this would be harder to relate to but I feel like it would be so true too
---
Yes. That's what he means.
---
You got them a TANK?
---
F. Then just use a good primary you like.
---
That may or may not be true
---
I would love NF’s that dropped specific pieces of an armor set
---
Lol I'm at 3 games for my solstice armor and I'm already fucking dead inside
---
Thanks.. I was just excited thinking factions are back 😌
---
“Guardian help”
---
see i did 3 reset in a weekend 
---
thats to much gambit
---
And then brought back 4 years later!!!
---
Antaeus Wards, Insurmountable Skullfort, Lion Rampants, Doom Fang Pauldron, Wormgod Caress, Helm of Saint 14 (soon with the ward of dawn buff), Synthoceps and Dunemarchers are my personal favourites.
---
i mean i did reach highest tear in a comp game mode 2 season ago on destiny tracker
---
Thanks a lot for the hint, I did not figure that out
---
The whole subclass is great and on top of that you have an OP super.
---
I don't think the mountaintop quest is much more difficult than recluse tbh but it is wayyyyy too grindy for me . It's not the fact that the kills will be hard to get that turns me off the quest but the sheer amount of time it will take
---
Theres a whole quest from Shaxx. The last step is 2100
---
If you're using throwing hammer you can use synthotoceps to get one shot hammers if you get a melee kill prior. Pretty fun if you're good at it. There's always ursa furiosa, which is also fun, and if you like grenades I'd use hallowfire heart, at the cost of supers. Doomfang is also decent for Sentinel.
---
What’s it called
---
*Fun* - Skullfort for endless top tree striker melees, Synthoceps for middle tree shenanigans. Lions Rampant for aerial carpet bombing.
---
*Viable OEM alternatives* - Dunemarchers. These things are really strong and very underrated in PvP. Doomfang Paldrons for powerful extended sentinel supers. Armamentarium for double suppressor grenades - this one takes a lot of practice but your teams will love you when you get it down.
---
If Anteus Wards weren't **still bugged** I would recommend them to anybody that likes playing hyper mobile slide shotties but unfortunately right now they still kill you via misadventure all too often.
---
just get a item manager
---
I never played D1 and I still do that sometimes
---
Little do we know Spider is also a "guardian" amd that is his ghost, but he grew too fat with strength; and now he can't move around...
---
I don’t get why people hate gambit so much. It’s one of my favorite activities on destiny 2.
---
I found a service revolver in my vault that had range mw/ac rounds/rapid hit/kill clip that I didn’t know I had the other day. Not as synergistic as yours but it’s an absolute god roll and I didn’t even know cause I transfer post master stuff using destiny item manager so much
---
Are you stuck at something or looking for someone to play with? if you're looking for someone I'd suggest leave your preferred console in the title or description next time.
---
See but in D2 if u wanna have fun just don't cast ward and use the normal shields and when u need it for dps or to survive cast ward when I started D2 as a titan I loved ward
---
10 baryon boughs and ya get me to help you fail in your raids (I'm the hunter)

---
https://youtu.be/sOWORorBf-A Enjoy
---
Oh thanks
---
I should clarify. When the boss yeets you, just hold W against it and you won’t really go anywhere
---
I’ve got the comp weapons so I’ve been playing solo comp for fun and help other solo players. I’m regretting everyone is so brain dead. No one caps, no one defends, people split up and run around by themselves more than rumble lol
---
Ok we need a few more bits of info before I can clue you in on how to proceed. 
---
- what other bits of DLC have you got?
---
- is there anything you specifically need help with, PvP has remained largely the same except it has moved to 6v6 in quick play. 
---
People are dismantling anything they have from eververse.
---
The reason being is it currently dismantles into bright dust because they cost bright dust to buy back from collections. 
---
However with shadowkeep it is being changed to they will discard for a nominal amount of mats and also be re-purchasable from collections for a nominal amount of mats. Dismantling now allows you to build up a nice nest egg of bright dust to use on the store when the next season rolls around and you can simply rebuy anything else you want from collections for easily farmable resources.
---
So you never infused anything ever? More like afk farm forges.
---
Apparently it first rolls whether to give you armor or weapon and then decides which one. So if you have all weapons but not all armor, you might still get a weapon duplicate.
---
I'll give you my firstborn son for 3 of 'em
---
Looks like a typical meta PVP loadout to me. Definitely not the odd-man out as I've seen in PVP.
---
I’m tired of afk people and report them (though it will do nothing).
---
We had a match where we were ahead, by a large margin. Didn’t even realize one person afk’d on my team until the other team made a come back.  Ironically... it was close at the end, but dude never left spawn.
---
Spare rations, mindbender
---

---

---
are you ok? do I need to take you to the tower hospital?
---
Cerberus is pretty good but it is also exotic, I’d much rather have breakneck with an exotic secondary or heavy.
---
There was no variety for Titans in D2 to begin with.. we were melting point spammers and that was it, and melting point will no change so..
---
The primeval is always taken, it’s kind of the point behind collecting motes of dark.
---
Yea I kno what you mean, there's always a grind, this article says any full legendary sets we own will be given to us as 2.0 armor, that we can pull from collections, so iv been farming my missing bits
---
U got yeeted by xol lol.
---
Exhibit A: ikora went to io to learn more from the traveller who she knew was the key to taking back the light and defeating the red legion, was undefeated in crucible and went on a crazy kill streak, wanted to avenge her friend, is an absolute badass
---
Exhibit B: is a coward who would let uldren sov run rampant instead of actually doing something about him to avenge cayde and also told everyone to protect the city instead of the traveller which ended up costing more lives because we all lost our light and the red legion took over when we became powerless
---
I know who I'd rather have as vanguard leader.
---
Not sure where you read that but I think you misunderstood it. The only set automatically converted to 2.0 for us is the solstice armor. All others you will have to require in the world.
---
The most overpowered deception to have ever lived
---
I know the feeling
---
You will reach the end, my fellow pvp magikarp.
---
At least it's not like that damn artifact quest where you lose progress. That's where I keep going between 0 and 4%. Up and down. Up and down. Getting seasick.
---
Dude. Warlock has been one of the most useful classes in the game for over a year now. At the consequence of completely invalidating titans in PVE.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
It's about time titans got something. So fuck off
---
Because I hate PVP and especially in Destiny 2 where if you don’t have the meta weapons, you’re going to become very frustrated and lose constantly.
---
None of its super enjoyable, but would rather go with gambit for some reason.
---
He lookin dummy thicc tho
---
Not even disputing that, it's about time Titans had something other than Hunters but all I keep seeing is complaints about anything Warlock
---
Rest assured that if the cap is raised to 250k bungie will make things more glimmer expensive making the cap as useful as 100k
---
Found out i had an curated Roll kindled orchid at my warlock's postmaster but I mainly play with my hunter...
---
I guess it’s a personal preference really, I’d say use whatever subclass you use the most of either Arc, Void or Solar! I bought all three personally
---
sweeeeet thank you, it's one of those things you've been staring at hours doing and you're unsure if it's still funny or good. I'm still uneasy about it but glad you like it!
---
If you need medals, just equip your comfortable loadout, get 5 motes and bank straight away, easiest medal there. After that, I just try kill stuff and not die to get Killmonger. Surely are better ways but it works for me
---
To bad the exhaust isn't purple
---
Yes it does count. Farm a fuck ton of bounties and turn them in when you're in legend rank so you dont have to do the wins. Saves a fuck ton of time.
---
it's kind of strange how in the stream bungie said they buffed void subclasses but didn't even talk about voidwalker i mean devour nova bomb is still a joke in pvp
---
Well played.
---
Never really thought of school as all that stressful
---
This honestly reminds me of that old family Guy clip ...
---
https://youtu.be/dDxmBnClB7k
---
so close, its a damn fine feeling when you finally do accomplish this
---
The one for Dredgen? I think they changed it to 75
---
Wow, that's impressive.
---
I’ll fight Bungie, first.
---
I just did it last week and didnt get anything

This is me right now. I've completed all the armor sets so now I'm gonna grind for dredgen before shadowkeep.
---
Got a message at the end of a game "you bad". KDA was shit cause I had 8 captures (giving off my position to the enemy team who would surround and rush me). My team collectively had 3, 1 of which was with me. 3 times I watched someone spawn behind me and just ignore I was trying to get a point, and they would run right passed me. Locked out at least 2 times.... I should have just stayed off the points, cause then maybe the loud f-ing alarm might trigger them to get on a point eventually. 
---
It's great when people have no idea how a win a game mode
---
dude i play gambit wayyyyy too much
---
I was being ironic about the cammy part because thats a meme when it comes to weapon and armor pieces being good or bad. But I guess when you have to write an essee on why you think that mask in perfectly balanced you aren't the most abreast when it comes to memes. 
---
Also y isn't foetracer used in PvP??? Ohh shit it dosen't give OH or the dmg buff for the full duel. You are jus't an biased titan main that probably uses LoW with bottom tree striker and abuses the instant switch canceling with titan jumps.
---
Have fun playing QP and telling youself that you are actually good at the game
---
On the bright side it's only 3 total resets and then you can buy it from drifter so they don't all have to be in the same season
---
The only problem with comp is that it's harder to get the multi kills because there's less ppl... I did this a few days ago and found the most reliable source of the multikills is very specific maps in qp where there are lots of choke points. Also having some good perks on militia's can make a huge difference.
---
I'd do MT before Luna's personally. It's so much more useful right now.
---
I did get the revoked too, too bad it is before that ghost shell.
---
Bruh there's a reason subtitles exist.... So u wouldn't need to put the meme in the caption
---
What exactly is your question?
---
What a great gift. She is very thoughtful.

&gt;Weeks of 9/10 and 9/24
---
Spectral blades
---
It is so much easier than D1. Just shotgun rush and you’ll get a good portion of it done.
---
I found that heavy was the way to multi kills in comp. People tend to group on heavy so if you can get it, you're likely to get multi kills.
---
Also, the value of each multi kill or CT is much bigger in comp. And it's easier to get more CT kills past 3 in comp, earning even more points
---
I can’t wait for shadowkeep so I can customize my build and put more focus into my resilience and recovery stats. I haven’t cared much for mobility personally
---
So why « kill me »? Just free drama nonsense?
---
Yep. It was soul crushing but I got it done this season.

If you get that $40 version you get Forsaken and the Annual Pass

I do
---
I went and watched all the live actions again. The feels. They make me tingle. Bless your Light, Guardian for helping me remember.
---
&gt;If u are a good pvp player you can outplay any class as a titan easily... People that complain about these things are just bad at the game and cant play their class. So stop commenting these things... It's true tho.

Same... I just need to reset my gambit rank once for dredgen and i haven't done it since last 3 months or so 😂
---
Mmmmmmmmmno
---
Big brain shitposts
---
What's your secret? Everyone just moved too fast for me.
---
"Get back down or you will not be coming up next time."
---
I'd pay a lot of money to be able to play the old raids.
---
I agree. Works great to keep your loss rate down. One of the last games of gambit I managed to bank 41 motes in a single round by doing this strategy. And best of all, I was able to keep their blockers from holding us up.
---
No
---
This is the dungeon called Shattered Throne.
---
I love running devourlock with winter's guile on the forges, grabbing an orb and just beating ads to death with it.
---
It was so awkward that she was cackling in her pajamas. I'm making fun of cringey livestream. Armor was good though. It's pretty much what I proposed 7 months ago: https://old.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/a80egk/two_ideas_for_how_to_make_armor_perks/
---
Hi. Im actually fairly new to reddit and dont know much how to use it. So thank you for pointing me in the right direction
---
anxiety, the game
---
Same! No need for recovery when you can dodge and vanish in thin air?
---
How do u get big boi tank in the strike
---
been there, done that.
---
I was more impressed at the fact you can make a build now that makes the arc buddy actually extremely relevant lol, in terms of the build potential I’m very impressed with the future.
---
I did my Petra's Run with 7 Mobility, 4, Resillience and 2 Recovery as a Hunter, doing most of the mechanics (standing on plates, cleansing with eyes).
---
I learned to thank my Warlocks after Shuro Chi and the Vault.
---
I want my icebreaker back lol
---
Please tell me you're kidding. It says rank up packages... Please tell me this is a joke
---
IMO, the green-to-blue and the blue-to-purple are a lot of work. Not hard... but just _a lot_ of grinding.
---
The masterworking process, while it's quicker (I completed 3 of 5 items in a couple hours) it may be the hardest (Shattered Throne, 200K NF).
---
I’ve heard resetting valor can make it drop. Probably is the best way.
---
Bring back all D1 weapons
---
Yes! Exactly!
---
All too true
---
Luke Smith is going to be addressing damage stacking in his post today. I highly doubt that Weapons of Light and a Well of Radiance will stack.
---
Don’t freeze up
---
Oh man Guile works with orbs? Sweet!
---
Once got head outside of the cabal ship on your left you should see one drop from thin air
---
I think your current armor is left alone. It will still be masterworked, but it will not be 2.0. The 2.0 solstice armor you get from Banshee will be free, but otherwise separate from your current armor.
---
Ok, f that then. I have other crap to grind for as it is. Thx
---
Watch the Armor 2.0 stream and you’ll understand my guy 😀
---
I feel like you probably wouldn’t be convinced either way, but counting the cost of the console online service seems like a bad argument if you play other games on that console already.
---
I just don’t understand the $100 for a year of D2.  If you’ve played since the beginning the annual passes haven’t been $100.
---
Time before regeneration starts — three seconds
---
Time before full recovery — four seconds
---
Or even better when you sprint into the fight with dead/almost dead teammates around you, do the cool slide rift activation to get there in record time...only for you to fall 3 inches from a small rock so the rift is canceled mid animation and you all die 2 seconds later because there is no rift healing you.
---
This happened to me, I lost the next match, then won the one after that, and then lost the next one, this went on 4 more times before I finally got it.
---
If I'm gonna be a corpse, I might as well be a fabulous one.
---
What?
---
As much as I loved Twilight Garrison back in D1, I really can’t use Icarus Dash now. I forget that I have it and when I remember, it doesn’t do anything for me
---
I would like to know,
---
\-  What would i be missing if i buy Shadowkeep, and never buy forsaken and the forsaken annual pass?
---
Can anybody tell me specifficaly what i will be missing? A raid and some strikes, maybe a couple off exotic weapons? Or anything else?
---
Ohhh and also, growing up with a controller in my hand, and playing D1 for years with a DS4, i now want to play D2 on Steam. I find mouse and keyboard fatigueing, and it gives me shoulder and wrist complaints if i use them extendedly. Gaming with a DS4 would be much more relaxing for me.
---
\- So... Will i still get to the lighthouse with my DS4 against all those keyboard warriors?
---
What are your thoughts?
---
Yeah, and there's draw, but I was just thinking about how fun it would be to have lame finger guns.
---
Solstice of heroes is an event every summer, celebrating the next year of destiny. It startet two or three weeks ago this year. While that time you are able to get the solstice gear (with a massive grind) and elemental orbs of the element you get kills with drop. These are needed for the grind. Also, the european aerial zone is available.
---
You had 5% primevil damage when they almost had 50% each. Killing guardians doesn't do much if you're not helping them kill hostiles for motes (you had 30 enemy kills?). It's obvious that you're focused on just killing guardians. Spread it out, try to balance it more. Work on collecting motes and helping your teammates kill hostiles so you guys can actually compete. Try to balance it out man and you yourself might realize that you've been thr blueberry all along
---
Then yeah, it's worth it
---
I’d love to know how much of a difference these points make - on a percentage basis. I mean, you may be set at zero recovery but you still have SOME recovery rate. Does a 10 mobility hunter move twice as fast as a 5 mobility hunter? Of course not.
---
Basically it might be like there’s an invisible 90/90/90 and if you add your stats your actual numbers are 100/92/90 which isn’t so extreme after all.
---
What roll do you have?
---
How it feels to be a warlock
---
Yes.  
---
Curated roll: Fullbore, light mag, outlaw, dragonfly, range masterwork.
---
That is dedication, guardian.
---
This backfired on you didnt it lol
---
I’ve fought this guy a lot on Xbox, he’s aight
---
lol. thats awesome! were you able to find a way to play d2 while you were there. my last tour, we had no internetz, only thing we could play was modern warfare 2 on an xbox we found...
---
Jumping vs taken ogre? Seriously?
---
Maybe wait until they actually come out with the update and then decide. Well’s currently worse for the game’s PvE than any other super, of course they weren’t going to leave it untouched.
---
That it is
---
When I’m dead, bedazzle me
---
Or the only thing you need is a braytech scout rifle for Wayfarer but it just doesn’t......want to.....drop...):
---
Handheld supernova and contraverse hold are my two new best friends for dealing with titans.
---
Beautiful, now go rack up more than 0 kills with it ;)
---
hey it’s DP
---
The one true sun spot
---
I think armlets are better. Kills give health back compared to increasing damage. So if you use that and crimson with devour, you can get so much health back
---
dreg
---
Gotcha.
---
Yeah but after doing it 3 times it's boring the 4th (I reset my titan because I wanted to redo warming completely with my friend so he felt included)
---
vandal
---
I think Marc might have something to say about that.
---
My friend keeps complaining that he’s a paper thin hunter that focuses on agility rather then resilience or recovery and I’m like “bro this is why warlocks and titans are better.”
---
u poor soul
---
i mean that.
---
I have one of each but my main and the first priority has always been my hunter.
---
Still the same nova bomb loving warlock main as when it dropped back in the good old days
---
Warlock. Forever.
---
I have a hunter that I finally brought up to 50 and a titan at lvl 29. The warlock though, that's me, through thick and thin.
---
When Destiny 1 first launched, I used to play warlock for quite some time up until the dark below dropped and then I switched over to hunter and have stuck with it ever since.
---
Don't be afraid to be aggressive sometimes, but make sure you're doing it as a team, if half of you want to be aggressive and half of you want to be passive you're going to have a bad time. It is supremely important to control the heavy, In most matches it will be possible to play the objective and control heavy at the same time so make sure you're doing that. On Control matches do not flip the spawns, hold your side of the map, specifically the side that gets heavy easier, and do not push into their spawn, having enemies spawn on either side of you is a nightmare. Super economy wins games, don't waste your super, Make sure you're using your supers in waves, and make sure you're using them in such a way that your team mates can get your orbs without compromising themselves. If you do it right it is possible to basically cycle supers endlessly.
---
I don’t think it does I’m not sure. I’ll test it when I get home from work.
---
Possibly
---
Read your own post
---
If he currently owns the base game, he can do Solstice. If he does not own Destiny 2, he'll have to buy it in order to play.
---
I've been tempted by the hunter a few times, especially for PvP
---
shank
---
Is forsaken needed if you have shadowkeep? What are you missing? I dont know how it will work. 
---
Your story going to have a gap? 
---
Seems really dumb to not have forsaken part of the pre order bonus. Or offer a everything bundle.
---
Fair play for sticking with what you enjoy
---
I thought it was based off collections no? Or does what is equipped/inventory matter
---
If it doesn’t say it you don’t get it. Hit the search bar up this is asked like daily on both destiny subs
---
I mean there isn’t much to say
---
And me too
---
[deleted]
---
Save gunsmith stuff for shadowkeep. Gunsmith drops new mods.
---
Sick
---
Its especially useful against Bosses though
---
Same I took me a month and finding out hits u hard
---
Agree actually, titans haven't seemed relevant for a while
---
I also solo queued to recluse, I did my matches with clanmates who wanted Recluse too and finished 2100 in like 2 nights. So I figured "Since I got the hard part done Ill do Mountaintop" I hate people now but I have mountaintop.
---
F
---
So is it pointless to start a warlock?
---
**MINE**
---
Depends on how hard he's willing to grind. I did it in a few days by playing the whole day non stop.
---
Hopefully
---
Sweet, I just hit my 5 Streak! Next game killed by Not Forgotten... wtf everyone has one.
---
(Sounds of a sports game) 
---
Zavala: oh sorry 
---
(Hangs up)
---
*"Books. Books for the Titans, too heavy. Oh no."*
---
not even a 24 hour repost
---
Oh, I guess it wasn’t explicitly stated, but it’d be weird if it weren’t 1000. Since they did confirm drops over 950 and they’ve always done increments of 50, at least in D2
---
i think it will have shatter as a option just like you can use bubble on defender and that's why they didn't show it off i mean bubble and nightstalker are not new animations however shatter would be so it more then likely will take more time to code and animate so i hope they are giving devour nova bomb shatter
---
Gather high value resources for shadowkeep. L shards and E cores mainly. Also gunsmith parts for 2.0 mods.
---
All Might Pose emote plz Bungo
---
Its funny how many people don't want a well nerf, even though it is making PvE way too easy and forces Warlocks to always run well in pinnacle activities.
---
Setting up patrols are part of the quest line I think, have you tried completing a quest on a planet?
---
Cool! Didn't know this was out. Thx for the link!
---
Are you overclocking your gpu? Sounds like your card is getting overworked by an OC. If not, it might be failing
---
That is exactly what I'm saying. That and correcting bad math from people who took remedial algebra for all of middle and high school and suck at it. Shuffling meta doesn't change how people play the game. You're still just standing around shooting a boss in the face.
---
While I agree with you about the regular increases of 50 power level from the previous seasons, it would be kinda weird to have a 4 digit number in the character UI/screen - It's definetly a possibility however, since there \*seems\* to be enough room for the 4th digit.
---
The stereotype is that titans are stupid, but lord shaxx has gotta be the most renaissance man npc/character in the game and lore.
---
imho, the people who have the biggest problems with this game are the people who play it for 1500 per year and are just burned out. Nobody is supposed to play a single video game that often. Your theory holds water, at least for me, because stuff like that is exciting to people who play 1500 hours and not so much to people who only play 100.
---
TBH I didn’t know that you could apply glows to blue armor. I’m still in blue, haven’t tried it.
---
Really?
---
https://www.usgamer.net/articles/18-12-2018-destiny-2-curse-of-osiris-dlc-guide-how-to-access-the-new-expansion
---
Yeah
---
10/10
---
I don't think you lose them, like every other ornament I am pretty darn sure you can re apply it to any solstice set you get from packages. Correct me please if I'm wrong community
---
You mean 60?
---
Really excited about these changes and to see the original D1 stats return. 
---
Can see this offering some actual depth to build options which just doesn't matter much right now.
---
Little concerned about the multiple upgrade materials and the complexity of certain weapon mods on certain armor elements. I hope it turns out to be simple in execution.
---
I'm actually looking forward to the great armor purge of 2019 as I clear out all of the armor in my vault "b/c it might be something I want to use".
---
Besides my raid team^
---
oof i didnt realise, i stopped playing destiny for a while so im only just getting back into it fully
---
I was definitely getting dupes before I finished my collection. I think I cracked like 4 xur engrams before I finally got Liar's Handshake from a random drop.
---
The Spare Rations is a random drop from either the end of a Gambit Prime Match or from the Likeness of Oryx boss in the reckoning activity (Tier 2 minimum). During Tier 2, you'll also have the chance to obtain the Outlast Pulse Rifle (540 Solar) and the Bug Out Bag Sub Machine Gun (900 lightweight solar). you are able to gain the curated Spare Rations randomly from completing the Half Banked medal, but is generally seen as not worth.
---
Getting my third one this week :). I picked one color for each character.
---
Incoming student stress farm
---
The main problem is that if they nerf well too much marking it less viable people won't use it and WOD will become the meta and later on people will want it too be nerfed they need  hit a sweet spot where have we have options but i don't think that it's really  possible with versatile  well can be.
---
I...actually prefer Recovery over Mobility. All you really need is Mobility of 5ish with Stompeez and you’ll have plenty of maneuverability. It’s nice to have Recovery of 7+ so you can jump into battle after just a few seconds, especially with extra regeneration tools
---
Lol just use golden gun easy 4 clap every time 😂
---
Sleeper was bad for sure but Queenie has half the charge time and the low zoom scope had so much aim assist.
---
Guns are haunted
---
I mean the one that gives you all that arc melee
---
Bold thing to say by someone within suppressor grenade range.
---
Like an aardvark.
---
This was me, but with unbroken. I just hit legend, and was like aw yiss finally, but realised I need two more glory resets.
---
Gotta have the hair as the hologram
---
Did anyone else immediately hear Yakety Sax playing when he started dancing?
---
Just me?
---
Okay then.
---
guess we're not talking about dawnblade huh?
---
as someone who has used truth just to see.. yeah, if you need to use this weapon and if you run outta ammo and cant use the other weapons, dont bother invading, or get good at pvp before you do lol.
---
i use last word, it works very well.
---
In the videos they shows they were around 800 or so, so it's possible
---
Overall great watch, after what happened to Hughie in the first episode I knew it was for me.
---
I believe they said that no, you won’t be able to pull out armor 2.0 pieces from the collections tab
---
I just invade with a last perdition. No problems.
---
1. It's ether
---
2. If you have to say 'no offense', it's offensive.
---
Yup. That's me... 😭😭😭
---
Should be in two weeks time.
---
They are also launching a fourth Iron banner due to the Shadowkeep delay
---
Did you solo que into comp or did you have a team?
---
just another generic "oem bad give likes" post, nothing to see here
---
One friend. Rest were randoms.
---
Xur only drops exotics up to Season 4. Anything post forsaken does not drop from him.
---
With Forsaken they added titles that appear under someone's name to show they've completed several associated tasks/collected certain gear.
---
Dredgen is the title that relates to Gambit. It has a whole convoluted lore reason and if you're interested in that I could point you in the right direction as well.
---
As you compete in Gambit you rank up and that score is called Infamy. Quickplay Crucible has Valor, and the Competitive playlist has Glory.
---
At certain thresholds of each you'll get rewards to drop as you increase ranks. Between 12,000-15,000 Infamy losses do not add anything and when you hit max Infamy (15,000) you can reset your score, which gives you more gear.
---
Reset Infamy once for the curated Trust hand cannon, twice for the curated Bad Omens rocket launcher, three times for the Furtive Shell ghost shell, three times *in one season* for the Ludomaniacal emblem.
---
Yes! Ah I love the story of Rabanastre. Shame to hear it's "lost" in the far future ;)
---
If you get the chance to pick up XII sometime please do, it has an incredible story in my opinion, if you can stomach the "main" character that you play as not actually being the character the story revolves around. I enjoyed the perspective, but many still criticize the game for that choice. 
---
Your character was just a commoner - it's your party members that are the royalty, the adventurers, the gifted and the fallen, etc. Super interesting. It's my favorite final fantasy game!
---
Three resets ever for the shell, three resets *in one season* for an emblem.
---
I usually use Revoker or any sniper tbh
---
Golgoroth challenge was probably my favorite encounter in either destiny
---
Advanced brush?? I struggle with standard!
---
£12, I think.
---
At least a month from now but they haven't explicitly given a season end date since announcing they were pushing Shadowkeep back to October.
---
