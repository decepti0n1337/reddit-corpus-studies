Lmao this community eats the trailers up every time. Do you remember the CoO trailer with Osiris in the fucking VAULT OF GLASS? Remember what CoO turned out to be? DO YA?

Drifter is going to lose his shit

Shut up

Just because no one uses them doesn't mean they're not there

Holy shit.

Imma go drag his body into the traveler and bring a nuke with me and demand a good ending for my boy

It also has a super obvious charge sound. If you run around a corner straight into it it'd your own fault...

Sick ¬°
---
Honestly hunters are the biggest bitches ever. They all think their are playing the worst class, it's actually hilarious
---
So anyone else having the feeling that Bungie is sort of doing a ‚ÄúBig Crunch‚Äù and bringing everything and everyone back to the center and Traveler to fight the darkness again?
---
Literally no one, hunters just enjoy complaining about stuff

My goodness that‚Äôs amazing man, you should be proud of that name

You made my day with this comment xD

Now do petra with a monocle

What tree makes warlocks toxic in pvp? I‚Äôm a warlock and hate pvp so I‚Äôd like to be toxic so I can get my bounties done and get the fuk out of crucible

He isn't angry, hes just too stubborn.

Every exotic quest ever.

He killed so many Vex that they contemplated their existence and became desperate. Something that no machine even has a working concept of.

Ok.

Bruh, it‚Äôs a meme. Chill.
---
Hol up.. what?
---
I can't summon my sparrow on Mercury. Am I missing something?

We killed like 50 enemies without our light and they were dogs and other ads.

Don't do this to me

I got mines last week and its in the vault

Idk man... Wei Ning is pretty cool...

Holy fuck you‚Äôre salty over this
---
I thought the quest was broken and not counting my kills with EV in strikes... turns out I just a lot more of them....
---
You‚Äôre a saint thank you!
---
You know I‚Äôve always thought that they built him a tomb with his body exposed just so they can keep an eye on him, scared that he may return from the dead.
---
Now we can kick Zavala over that ledge and make Saint-14 the vanguard Titan we all deserve.
---
Me too. It would give me hope they'll do the same for the other year 1 zones. Especially Titan and Mars.
---
Vortex grenades are DOT so not one hit. Scatter might one hit if they all hit one person but s
---
Not this guardian.
---
Nice. Is that auto loading holster? And is First Glance like it‚Äôs version of Box Breathing?
---
You guys have handheld supernova while I need Forsaken to get it :(
---
Nope destiny 1 had strictly ps exclusives before the merge. Then d2 came out and still had exclusives but it's not as heavy anymore.

I got it and thank you!

Damn I didn't even think about that, nice.
---
About to be a speedy boi!!
---
Number one put on oem then it is cancer number two what is the message in the bottom right corner
---
That certainly didn't help matters, but the place is built like a Formula 1 track, meaning it doesn't make as much sense to have sparrows banned on Mercury and not banned on Titan (which, for contrast, is built more like a jungle gym).
---
NYOOM~~~

You are absolutely right. It's the perfect spot to race around while your friend is changing shaders and their finishers.
---
I think so, it destroys shields if you perk 1st glance and get a crit. Currently experimenting in gambit with it but if there‚Äôs a lot of solar in nightfall or hunts its top choice for me
---
Every warlock is missing out on Prodigal Robes
---
Yep. It‚Äôs sad too. When shadowkeep came out I said ok this is it. Bungie is without activision let‚Äôs see who the real problem was. Shadowkeep comes out with an excellent and in your face mobile marketplace experience with a new eververse and a bunch of reused content. I liked the story but when are we going to see it continued? Do we even want to see it continued? I feel like the pyramid people will just be mild reskinned threats. I was done a few weeks into shadowkeep and I‚Äôm staying off until trials/faction rallies come back for the first time since the d1 alpha. Bungie WAS the real problem.
---
Merp I use hunter. I am getting better. I just have to play more.. that's all!
---
Taken. Tried to redeem it and somebody snagged it. Figured I'd save you guys some time.
---
Consider: Cayde being uploaded to our ghost
---
I mean if Drifter isn‚Äôt writing ALL the recipes it‚Äôs a waste.
---
Of course his voice lines probably won‚Äôt even be updated.
---
Yep. Just give it a few weeks and im sure people are going to realize these things. Wait Bungie you just turned the vex offensive into the cabal offensive and we‚Äôre just doing the same thing!?!?
---
Vex Gateways. They link to another world, Gatespace, which exists outside of normal time and space. Using this, the Vex can basically send their units anywhere, anywhen. To clarify perhaps, imagine time is a river, always flowing in one direction, with high, steep banks that keep you from climbing out. Vex Gateways are like ladders that let you get out of the timestream and walk along the bank, so you can get back in wherever you want.
---
I've had surprisingly good luck with vortex kills, I guess peeps be dumb lol, as for scatter yeah I get a hail Mary every once in a while
---
I understand this is old, but new info might be useful to some. I posted on the D2 forums, and received a response from Bungie: 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt;Hi there,  
---
We're currently investigating an issue where the ‚Äúcomplete ten legendary frames‚Äù steps for the J√∂tunn and Le Monarque Exotic quests is currently only counting curated weapon drops from Black Armory forges.
---
It should be accessible from patrol, and it should‚Äôve gotten the Escalation Protocol treatment.
---
After almost two years... so pathetic.
---
Yep. It‚Äôs painful to see and anyone denying it is just blind. They have no excuse to reuse all this content except the community has accepted it.
---
Its overall and not additional
---
Cayde was voiced by Nolan North in Forsaken wasn't he?
---
I replied to him, but will here as well. Received official reply from Bungie on the forums - 
---
With Cayde-6. (Too soon?)
---
https://www.ishtar-collective.net/categories/saint-14
---
Do you have the template for this
---
Osiris can manipulate time in the forest. Cayde-6 never entered the forest, and therefore Osiris cannot find a replica of him and put his previous mindset back into existence.
---
Nah, if they do it right. Right after we meet Saint 14, if we go back to see Drifter, we should just get him crossing his arms with the biggest smug grin and chuckling "Told ya so."
---
Wait, are you suggesting the game isn't perfectly balanced? It also be kinda crazy if two of the three classes had to generate speed to get any hight at all while one of them could just instantly go straight up in a burst of speed. Thatd be insane brother
---
They know what we like.
---
...not sure
---
I want to see the original article for this. How tf does this make sense
---
I've never teabagged in Destiny, but I feel like I would definitely do so if I got killed by an oem Titan using Johtunn. I hate being one shotted by Titan shoulder charges, and i can't stand being killed by the Johtunn. To be killed by both would probably cause me to have a brain aneurysm and tea bag so hard when I killed them back
---
I am not joking if you want that D1 warlock trench coat vibe grab prodigal robes and equip the ironwood shader.
---
She looks like Palin
---
Was a walk in, only cost 120 so really good for what I got. Only touch ups I think it might need are rounding out the traveler and straightening up some stuff. Though it is fresh so some of that may take care of itself!
---
Titan approved. I like punching things.
---
One shot kill abilities all suck. How about we remove them All?
---
The Apostate from the Pit of Hersey.
---
I appreciate the *dink* at the end!
---
Warlocks that use handheld supernova are scum, only slightly better than oem mtntop recluse titans. I used to main warlock and i only went dawnblade for nyooooooms across the map and devour.
---
0 second cool down after a kill
---
I'm game
---
I would bet on any day that outlaw kill clip is more efficient than rapid hit. How does getting an extra 4 bullets per mag even make a difference. 
---
Outlaw kill clip
---
Slideshot opening shot
---
Is what u want
---
Tbf the one shot titan hits require titans to get real close
---
I think the audio timed well lol
---
u/dmg04 confirmed on Twitter that Sparrows are coming to Mercury
---
He might just go bro-sploring with Osiris in the end.
---
I very clearly remember the nonsense that it got up to. But I still miss some of it. Namely suncharge.
---
santa-XIV
---
Maybe. We never actually gave him the shotgun in the story yet. Still a chance that he plays his part in the expansion (quasi-permanently) until he takes his place in the forest sometime in the future long after destiny is over as a game, but not over in the game's timeline. Sucks to think about, but still holds the paradox together.
---
Player base is very active, never to later to join, I don‚Äôt think it will be to much
---
Didnt know you could get black armory gear as new Light player. Thats cool of bungie
---
10 lbs is relative. 10lbs if sawed off ears is a lot. 10 lb dumbbell not so much.
---
That's a bad hacker, he needed 3 lives to kill you lmao
---
Don‚Äôt know why but it feels like titans have the biggest dicks.
---
TITANZ YEAAAAAAAAH
---
I‚Äôll be entirely honest I didn‚Äôt even have the volume on XD I was just referring to the hammer I main devastation and I can here the *dink* in my head when it lands a hit. But the audio did line up beautifully!
---
Yes and I‚Äôll pay ten god damn dollars for it too any other questions
---
Yeah Nathan Fillion quit and hasn't been Cayde-6 since before Forsaken. However, Nolan North voiced Cayde for Forsaken and could potentially voice Cayde-7, assuming that's what we'd call him going forward
---
Hunter is the Crown of Sorrow raid set, Titan is the Dreaming City set
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ talking bout British pounds here mate üòÇ
---
Right before reset of that week, actually. I was lucky. They were sent out in two batches, the next one will be sent out next month, if I remember correctly. Hopefully yours come in then
---
It is fantastic, I love it
---
IIRC Cayde-5 made up a fake wife and kid in the hope that Cayde-6 would "remember" them as well and be a better person as a result.
---
That'd be pretty cool but idk in one of his casches cayde did say he didn't want to be cayde 7
---
And have doing the thing! *seriously you gotta watch this*
---
Yess, though down in Texas, not too much of a need, sadly
---
My favorite vex look is backü§òüèº
---
Not sure if this is sarcasm or not, but they did bring back the khvostov with new light. You can either play the starting mission if youre a new light player or just go to your collections if youre a veteran
---
No the sparrows on mercury
---
That's the only reason I occasionally play warlock over hunter the supers are way better I mean stortrance beats arcstrider chaos reach out dps celestial nova is better than blade garage unless it's mayham
---
Judging from the Lumina quest... Well, Yes, but actually no.  You can always pull another copy from Collections (assuming it remains curated)
---
Mission accomplished.
---
Because it‚Äôs true
---
I mean the exotic version, i know the white one is back
---
Sparrows being added to mercury was hinted at in the trailer but I don‚Äôt quite remember where
---
Exactly. At least the current one counts double, but it's still an ass pain and a half to wait for it to come around
---
I don‚Äôt think Shiro will be popping up anytime soon, since he isn‚Äôt that significant to the plot.
---
But I can think of a Hunter-ish character that would make a fairly big impact, but I‚Äôve got *no time to explain*, if you catch my drift.
---
‚Äúhunter is too op‚Äù
---
Then use it
---
Yes, trailer came out today
---
I see
---
And you didn't buy it ?
---
Oooh, okay lol. Yeah that would be nice too
---
It takes skill to land those shots correctly..like any other handcannon. Nowadays it's Completely dead on PC
---
I want some exostential crisis
---
What? Halo 5‚Äôs story was not created by Bungie at all.
---
I cant get the quest for it for some reason
---
Rampage mod doesn't give it rampage btw
---
Happened to me on Bannerfall yesterday except we both respawned exactly on the same spot... Thankfully I noticed before him.
---
Get a fireteam, at least one person who remotely knows what they‚Äôre doing, and tell him not to use the random blue weapons he just got from a Vanguard strike.
---
Some titan is one hit downvoting a looooot of comments.
---
if he just doesn't enjoy it you don't have to do something about it imo. He can also play the nightfall for exotics
---
All of his weapons are purple tho
---
How do you make gifs like this? Thanks!
---
Yes, the trailer showed sparrows being used on Mercury's patrol area. dmg04 also confirmed on Twitter regarding it, "It's happening."
---
Fated engram?
---
&gt; Bringing him back now would cheapen that
---
Eh, we do kind of need him back though.  Game feels empty without him.  Zavala is boring, Ikora is too moody, etc etc etc.  No one else really drives the story like Cayde did.
---
He was kind of the heart and soul of the game and they've really provided nothing to replace it with.
---
Yes, but in the trailer, he directly says that us killing the undying mind, has messed up the timeline. Because we killed multiple undying minds, across multiple timelines.
---
I think this was linked to an exotic quest or some step to a quest not to sure tbh been a while
---
Might be starting to have some memory trouble with that many reboots... Nice card, though.
---
Lmao! This is the best meme I‚Äôve seen in a while
---
It doesn‚Äôt include the forskin dlc, but it does come with the season pass and future season passes until the next big dlc. I‚Äôm not sure about warmind and Osiris, since you have to buy the campaign but I think the content is still free.
---
I know, I‚Äôm saying it happened before he went into the infinite forest. This isn‚Äôt the last time we‚Äôll see him
---
Buggie but the cross hair below were it should be lol ;]
---
Cool. Another question though, how do you do them. Vance hasn‚Äôt offered me any and I‚Äôve done all the adventures and the public event on the planet. 
---
What am I missing?
---
Even Palpatine would be scared
---
I just want to meet saint and play all of it at once...
---
I wouldn't mind a mod for auto aiming or really big AoE damage for the one shot knife. Warlocks got their grenades, titans got their shoulder charge/slam, hunters can finally have something that requires minimal aim
---
No
---
You think that's a fist we use to hit things?
---
U should check the hardware on the video aswell maybe.
---
Other than that idk xD
---
People are gonna cry about everything because they are either getting housed, losing the war, get caught slippen by Randy's throwing knife, recluse, erantil and now a knife. Get over it or go play COD...little titty babies
---
Shadowkeep and foresaken
---
At least we know the darkness has bad pilots
---
What CPU are you running? I‚Äôm getting 100-110 at 3440x1440 on an RTX 2080 &amp; 9700k at high settings.
---
He also decided the best use of his time (before he learned about Osiris heading into the Forest, that is) was to style on all the Fallen houses that had attacked the City during Six Fronts, as a warning to the rest.  Culminating in popping the then-Kell of House Devils' head with a headbutt, as she was choking him out.  (If you've ever looked at the Helm of Saint-14 exotic item and wondered why there was a big dent in it, now you know) 
---
And, once he did learn about Osiris poking around in the Forest, did the same with the Vex therein for decades in our time.  Which, given how in flux time is there, could be centuries, millennia even, of non-stop fighting the Vex in Forest time.
---
I saw one with a 3700X and 2080 SUPER. That's the closest to my spec you can come without it actually being my spec :'(
---
I know a similar feeling, I recently decided to get all my catalysts done, for every weapon. I hate myself more everyday.
---
I got burnt out but put in over 100 hours. I got undying with shadowkeep so it was just a bunch of free shit to me. And if everything wasnt time gated we all would of been burnt out 4 weeks in.
---
Ohh shit ohh fuck
---
Oh god, this is making me think of Savathun as the next hunter Vanguard...now that would be a punishment worthy for her crimes.
---
That last line is how i picture some historians in the destiny world explain things
---
Now he's back, to be forgotten again
---
There's more.  I already mentioned his crusade against the Fallen in another comment, but it is exceedingly plausible that as much as he is an inspiration to you, you are as much so or greater so to him.
---
Lumina gang rise up
---
Shit gun? You are very misinformed my guy. The divinity is ducking AMAZING for stuff like nightfalls, raid bosses, and master nightmares hunt, etc
---
More like ways of improving the game except for just ideas for eververse all the time.
---
Ryzen 7 3800X
---
Conduction Tines, the exotic perk of his helmet can extend the super and increase arc ability regeneration. Conduction Tines x 3 is very effective.
---
I think he still might have some extra lines about the events happening, but don't count on it
---
imagine playing destiny 2
---
Yep and bungie will keep going. Nothing will improve same bonehead headscratching ideas.
---
No you haven't. There has not been a one-hit kill throwing knife in PvP.
---
It's coming next week.
---
Why not curated Blasphemer best of both worlds.
---
True, but he was using the other tree which allows him to use ionic blink.
---
Why the hate on golden gun or was that just a joke
---
Frickin space wizards!!
---
U need help
---
They are bring sparrows to the map
---
I started last year and I haven't touched mercury after I finished the story there, so I can't say I know the struggle

Majority (not the vocal minority) don't do raids at all. (that's actually the other way around, the ones who do raids are VERY vocal minority, like 15% of players ever did a single raid in their lives, and something like 5% of playerbase ever did 2 or more of them).
---
Wtf?! I‚Äôm playing from release on steam. And I don‚Äôt have enough time to complete previous seasons content. Don‚Äôt delete shadow keep activities from the game. Or continue shadow keep season for one-two month.
---
The other one, Symmetry, is a scout. You get Symmetry from the season pass. 
---
The file name of this image is s9_rewards_fusion.jpg.

All in all, I'm excited for this one! Appears to be solar by the color of the projectile in the trailer.

I once hit a headshot and in a friendly crucible match while the reticle was on my friend‚Äôs crotch as a joke.  That was with a hand cannon.  Try telling my there‚Äôs not aim assist

(„Å§ ‚óï_‚óï )„Å§

The problem most people have when comparing the two boils down to the same thing we had with Destiny 2 before Forsaken - we were comparing a game with no updates to one that had many significant expansions and updates. Of course Civ V was going to be the 'fuller' experience - you had better expectations of the opportunities one had, it had 2 very significant expansions that fleshed the experience out. Vanilla Civ 6 had features some people didn't like, and didn't quite have the depth and multitude of features Civ V did at the end of it's lifetime. As usual, we always forget the improvements it made, such as a religious victory out the gate, and a multiplayer that didn't disconnect so much it physically hurt.
---
We can quite literally take Destiny as an example - Vanilla Destiny 2 was bad. It had a number of features we didn't want and streamlined the experience to the point where it was no longer fun. It was simple, not very deep, and had difference we didn't necessarily like, such as the weapon system and lack of skill trees. Now, I can happily say Destiny 2 is the better game. Sure, there are aspects I prefer in D1, such as their armor and some of the ships, but as a whole, D2 is the superior experience imo. 
---
Like D2 now, I think Civ 6 is now the superior game; they both took what the predecessor needed to improve upon  and then released expansions that, while perhaps not to your liking, improved upon, expanded, and deepened systems in the game, bringing back what worked, and reinventing or creating new systems.
---
Boi ;-; You actual Boi
---
I don't know his lore either no worries
---
Saint-14 didnt get a bullet through the robot brain though
---
I‚Äôd only had it for 5 minutes at that point lol
---
And he never. Stopped. Punching.
---
You can pull all of that year 1 stuff from collections
---
This is The Way.
---
Seemed real fluid to use when I was testing it out
---
I think you get 4 other seasons
---
I think i read somewhere that it stacks up to 10 seasons or so? Or it will just give you 1000 silver (worth a season)
---
I dont get what your point is. Are you trying to say that the only people who complain are people who raid?
---
You are the one crying.   Look at this essay you wrote.  Gholly.   Lol.   Lmao.
---
No I used Leviathan armor. Like the original set
---
"Rage is a hell of an anesthetic."
---
Last time we had a buddy helping us with the run and gun part of the mission, he didn't get to go home...
---
There will be new ritual weapons each season
---
(At least thats how it worked last year)
---
West of Sunfall 7
---
Also hand cannons don't "bounce all over the place" there's a fixed direction they kick when fired. Typically it's up and at some degree to the right. West of Sunfall's kick is actually towards the player, which results in less "jump" when it kicks.
---
I have finals on release day. And the day after.
---
And the day after...
---
Log off your character and then log in again. It should complete
---
she kinda quirky doe... üò∂
---
Shadowkeep is not going anywhere
---
Just Vex offensive and the weapons that drop from there
---
Mara is gay, and it would demean them both as characters as far as I'm concerned for the writers to have them suddenly have meaningless sex with no lead up. Mara is the secretive and extremely shifty queen of an entire race, and Shaxx is a single-minded battle machine who I would be surprised even thinks about sex. Even the gift for whomever he was keen on during the Valentine's Day event was a weapon. 
---
Shaxx appeared in front of her because she Wished for Riven to teleport him there from the Last City.
---
Yeha I love it for pve
---
It is easy, if you focus on the prophecies it doesn't take long. I did all the prophecies in two days.
---
he is very much alive but i'd be pissed if he becomes the next vanguard
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
Ask a stupid question and you get a stupid answer.
---
I think he sounds more Greek. It would fit his helm too.
---
ah yes, i'm the hunter vanguard... wanna know the perk of being a hunter vanguard? i can use warlock subclasses
---
Lol.
---
And you mean to tell me, that someone who is super passionate to their cause got bored and wanted to rattle the legendary Shaxx herself ? 
---
... that‚Äôs not uncharacteristic and weird ? Lol 
---
But, it‚Äôs not like they give us enough character development to solidify these assumptions but it‚Äôs definitely fun to debate about. Especially the hottie Mara Sov and the always intense Shaxx. Lol
---
Never understood why everyone liked cayde so much. Always thought he was a corny character.
---
Wait i havent played the game in a while do you have to pay for every season pass?
---
just walk toward him?
---
This is the way
---
Oh man. That hit hard.
---
wat? there's a gender neutral bot? now i've seen everythi- oh wait, i still haven't seen cayde-7
---
I mean I'm not ok with any if it. I'd prefer balance and a focus on skill.
---
Because he doesn't need the crutch.
---
So far I'm waiting for the reveal tomorrow.
---
As of now all we get is reskins, a new exotics, new eververse stuff and that's about it if we look at the trailer.
---
So no hype over here. More concerned we may get an even worse Curse of Osiris 2.
---
Honestly people are really sleeping on the top tree void melee. It gives you a huge overshield that lasts 15s, and every kill you make with the overshield reduces its cd. It also buffs your melee damage, so basically you can punch stuff to death for 15s and then use the melee ability again to have permanent overshield, as long as there's enough adds.
---
Hold on to your Ghosts!
---
Cayde-F (to pay respect)
---
It throws me off though because he says ‚Äúyour team‚Äù and ‚Äúopposing team‚Äù while talking to eight Gambit players. Unironically kinda an immersion killer
---
That would be sick.
---
No.
---
You mean full health right?
---
I mean you'll only die if you group up on one point all snuggled up next to each other. It's kinda overrated, bad neutral game and a crappy super to boot.
---
Uldren was brought back as a guardian. His ghost spent centuries looking for a suitable guardian. Everyone loved the ghost and nicknamed it Pulled Pork. There was a cut scene in the black armory season that showed Uldren getting revived and coming back to life.
---
I LOVE YOU, GUARDIAN! BE BRAVE, AND ENJOY YOUR CHOCCY MILK
---
I usually complain about reskins, but so far this season has way less reskins that the one before.
---
*laughs in Lion Rampants*
---
Only the glory requirement for luna will reset.
---
What does that have to do with my question?
---
With synthoceps and a one 2 punch shotgun it actually does really decent damage. Not as much as a thundercoil striker obviously but very good considering the amount of survivability you get. I use it all the time with Monte Carlo to top me off when needed. Plus the super really helps out in boss fights.
---
And if you need to level up season ranks fast remember to spam your dailies on top of repeatable vex offensive bounties - all of them require you to just kill vex, which can be done within couple of minutes in center zone lost sector on nessus (the one where you spawn on that tall tower)
---
!remindme 8 hours
---
Did you forget that hunters also have trip mine?
---
I‚Äôll say it again:
---
#Andal Brask.
---
Right in the feels.
---
never played d1 and can't begin to imagine brother vance being mysterious.
---
Looks more like assault or submachine to be fair.  
---
But i could hug new fusion rifle.
---
Ok thank you for that explanation I think because we killed the undying mind and time on mercury is fucked so past present and future are overlapping like you said we can pull him out of the forest because he is alive while his future self is still in the tomb that the vex made for him so most likely after season of dawn he will go on with his timeline and due in the tomb or the sundial will be able to warp the timeline completely meaning we will have a new Titan vendor at the tower
---
I have a 2tb ssd and load time is still abysmal

Is that Bob from Hearthstone?

Glad you like it. Just trying to raise awareness for my buddy. He deserves it. Also. Right. In. The. Feels.

The one K.O knife is fair
---
Really? Dam, does yours plug into the USB or do you have the extension the plugs into the side of the console?
---
There is no quest directly about him afaik. Thats whats comming to appear in next season.
---
Only thing close to it is that you could see part of his burial room in story mission.
---
6/10 didnt kill everyone on the planet
---
Appreciate this post as I‚Äôm just getting back into Destiny. One question tho, how long does it take to get the Recluse? I really want it but don‚Äôt know how to get it or how long it takes? Cheers
---
would you rather have cayde come back as a murderous psychopath(cayde said he didnt want to resurrect again because he didnt want to become psychotic and kill his friends) or remember him a heroic psychopath?
---
This season isn‚Äôt only the vex though if it is at all they say I think the page for the season were stopping a group of cabal not vex from undoing our victory against Ghaul
---
You have to complete the lost profecies that brother Vance gives you. Once you complete either verse 10, or all verses he gives you in a week (I'm nit really sure which one of the 2) you get a new verse from him, verse 11. This one gives you acces to the quest you're looking for
---
Sorry, not possible
---
I made this in Adobe Photoshop. I hadn‚Äôt realised that someone had already posted a format very similar to this.
---
Pretty much they nerfed a gun in way that wouldn‚Äôt really affect pc players
---
You just need to have the knowledge, I think it‚Äôs great, just for true destiny players
---
Only if we get Nathan Fillion Cayde, please.
---
There are the Prophecy Tablets which has a part about Saint 14 along the way
---
Give me my Iron Wreath back, ill be happy.....shot gunners be sad.
---
‚ÄúHoly fuck we finally managed to kill him!‚Äù
---
‚ÄúI dunno... are you sure he‚Äôs dead?‚Äù
---
‚ÄúMaybe he‚Äôll stay dead if we build him a tomb?‚Äù
---
Def better than when you almost single-handedly cause a Mercy Rule in THEIR favor... :(
---
probably
---
I am titan and I hate myself
---
The sundial didn't revive Saint-14. Saint-14 was trapped in the infinite forest, fighting across timelines. He only died in the timeline we visited, he lived in certain others. The sundial only allowed a version of Saint-14 to re-enter our timeline. Cayde could not be brought back because Cayde died in our timeline, not in the infinite forest where time is merged together.
---
After CoO we entered Y2 of Destiny with Forsaken expansion. New game mode called Gambit now exists with its own director launch next to Crucible and Strikes. New weapon and armour systems, weapons got random rolls and loot pool exploded. Every guardian got new supers, such as Spectral blades and Well of Radiance. Plot line here is: Cayde and the guardian help petra venj with a prison riot in the prison of elders. It turns out this was a prison break where Uldren Sov released the ‚ÄòBarons‚Äô (bosses from a new race called the Scorn). Uldren kills Cayde-6, we hunt down the barons and uldren sov, eventually we get the last wish raid. Next is Black Armoury DLC, we get the forges, a new way to forge special weapons like the Hammerhead and Kindled Orchid. We also got the Scourge of the Past raid. Story line of this DLC can be overlooked, it‚Äôs ‚Äúcampaign‚Äù is unlocking the forges and finishing the seasons exotic quests. Next was season of the drifter, which gave us...... gambit prime.... and reckoning. Lastly for Y2 there was season of Opulence. Great season that gave us the Crown of Sorrow raid aswell as the Menagerie, 6 man match made activity to farm weapons of your choosing. Only storyline of any kind for this season is the lore behind the raid and listening to Calus‚Äô voice lines in menagerie. Finally shadowkeep released with Season of Undying to start Y3. We returned to the moon, met Eris and killed nightmares of past enemies who were resurrected by the pyramid ships we saw at the end of the vanilla campaign. This storyline‚Äôs progress stopped as we were brought to the Black garden for the Garden of Salvation raid. This and vex offensive told the story of us slaying the Undying mind over and over which is where the new season, Season of Dawn picks up. In the trailer Osiris mentions this, you should be caught up now
---
Yeah, I just went on a 14 streak today from around 4200 to Legend. Now I just gotta do the Luna's kills.
---
The most annoying part was the lag, which makes most of my melees and 1v1s, a trade unless I have the upper hand with higher HP.  And the opponents hacking on Asian servers which goes without saying.
---
Need help from a fellow intro
---
Honestly same, am i the only who cried at the ending when BT said protocol 3, protect the pilot and threw him out so that bt would destroy the arc?
---
Yeah that‚Äôs why Osiris and this time traveling bullshit has to die
---
How dare you. I bet you main Ronin. I bet you walk around the map with your weeb sword and don't even try to kill other Titans.
---
There is also possibility of seeing another Cayde‚Äôs death...
---
the only very good pinnacle weapon is recluse and it gets nerfed. all other weapons including randys or especially mountaintop are not worth the effort because there are too many better or "as good as" weapons out there.
---
the time when you worked your ass off and get paid with an exclusive pve/pvp shredder is over.
---
Honestly, by the time you grind out the main quest and play it through, there‚Äôs no need for side quests, but if your looking for the fun stuff and finding lore, side quests are a go to. If not, just play through the game. Postgame is when you start grinding exotics and such. There‚Äôs really no blue or green gun worth grinding. Exotics after you finish the campaign are what you‚Äôll be grinding.
---
This made my day. So far.
---
Not hearing it because he and cause are dead, nothing will change that, death is permanent UNUS ANNUS
---
There is one if you do the prophicy boxes on Mercury till you get a box 11, that one starts a mission that directly is about saint14 and his shotgun
---
Hello, is this dog?
---
He‚Äôs actually not Russian, he‚Äôs Greek
---
get wealth of the emperor from benedict and use that. run the lake of shadows strike and try to do it as fast as possible. once you run out of wealth of the emperor (only 3 a week) keep running the strike it‚Äôll just give you a lower chance at imperials. also menagerie triumphs give you 500 each one you complete.
---
Glasses makes everything better, have you ever seen those doggos with glasses?
---
that is a sexy sniper rifle
---
It was a hunter actually. I'm not sure on the specifics of how it worked but you seem to not have no acceleration rather a constant velocity so he speed up past me and headstabbed.
---
I mean if they are bringing in actual time travel they could do anything
---
Yeah that‚Äôs right why bring back some thicc titan boi and not cayde?
---
Correct!
---
yup, exactly this
---
great, now that I see it, I can't see anything else.
---
sorry that you can‚Äôt skate anymore but you don‚Äôt have to be mad about it.
---
Time for a crusade
---
It‚Äôs elegy-49 with the calus selected shader
---
I will fucking incinerate your ass
---
For randy you need 450 scout rifle kills (I recommend night watch, mida, or jade rabbit) and then you need to get a large number of kills and medals, then you have to get 2100 glory points.  It‚Äôs fun to play with as well
---
I don‚Äôt think it has snap shot but it is elegy-49
---
I gotta say, with all the problems the game has, it is one of the most beautiful games I‚Äôve ever played, sometimes I just stop to admire the landscape around
---
When you've had enough of the one eyed freak with Mountaintop - Recluse:
---
If you go to Brother Vance on Mercury, he will offer 10 (I think it‚Äôs 10) prophecies. These are quests that you can complete one at a time by consuming ingredients found from playing the game, and then ‚Äòforging‚Äô them in the Lighthouse on Mercury. Once you‚Äôve done all 10 prophecies you‚Äôll get another one that is not numbered and it will give you a mission to go into the infinite forest and &gt;!save Saint-14 from the Vex!&lt;. After completing this, you get Perfect Paradox.
---
Where do I get such a perk?  That sounds useful, as I play a lot of crucible.
---
We can't talk to him because he's talking to (past) us... Have the entire mission mirror the mission Homecoming.
---
Ye its totalt worth it. The online Side is very active. You can play the Main games campaign and Side missions solo, and most of the exotic Quest, but some require a fireteam, but thats easy, there are a lot of fireteam finder you can use. If you are done with the Main campaign you can also play The "curse of osiris" campaign and "Warmind" campaign too. Those are 2 of the first DLCs in destiny 2 and you get Both free. If you have finnished every campaign you can Always play crucible or PvP. If you are fast enough you could also buy "Forsaken" for 15$ now on the Steam sale, and that DLC is great!
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm too comfy with this build. I‚Äôll miss it a lot.
---
Superhero landing
---
Actually that's not what my comment said at all, I said it will still be good the only thing gone will be the overshield.. the tracking and increased damage to tracked enemy will still be extremely useful
---
You can kill the boss for 21% then open the chest for 12%. That gives 33%. You can only do it once a week so it takes 3 weeks
---
Yes the chests and mission completion only give progress once per week. If you do all chests and complete the mission you should get around 36% I believe, so it will take only 3 weeks.
---
Sooo, shaxx vs saint-14, who will be more popular..?
---
Vex, hive, taken, nightmares: all are extensions of "The Darkness". I think we are getting to a point that we, guardians of the Light, will have to embrace what we fight in order to defeat it. Imagine new abilities based on darkness instead of light: What might a dark grenade, melee, or super look like?
---
Happy LDOC.
---
If I remember right without the chests it will take 5 weeks and with them 3 weeks and yes each individual chest only gives you stuff once per week.
---
Wait what is this
---
1. These aren‚Äôt the real prices. It‚Äôs designed that way so you actually have to earn the collectibles by completing the requirements in-game. This give you a special discount code that you redeem in the store which brings the price down to normal.
---
2. You couldn‚Äôt buy these without earning it even if you tried. The store was designed with a $2000 cap to help prevent people from getting things that they didn‚Äôt earn.
---
I support that lmao
---
The fastest way is to pick up Eris morn bounties, then go to the closest lost sector and do them their. Then rinse and repeat
---
Seriously it‚Äôs been my favorite build ever
---
Just so long as you ban photos of what's on monitors/TVs I'll sub.
---
go back to instagram
---
Please let this meme format take off
---
Yep. And I‚Äôm 99.99% sure all exotics are recollectable.
---
Great reply thanks!
---
Who are these 2? I thought I made my own character?
---
Right now I‚Äôd farm the vex invasion and the moon before seasons end, always drops a load of weapons and some tasty stuff this season. Menagerie and Black Armoury too
---
Ok thanks I'll get stuck in.
---
Np. Any questions, just ask! Welcome to the fireteam guardian!
---
*laughs in tier 10 Mobility and Stompies*
---
He isn't resurrecting Saint I don't think. I am pretty sure he is actually getting him from a different time line, not resurrecting him from ours
---
Ok thanks man.
---
Wait who is he again??
---
This and Whisper mission need matchmaking.
---
I'm actually looking something to get addicted to after loosing the love for ARK where I had spent a shit ton of hours in.
---
Sorry to be that guy, but for future reference, it‚Äôs spelled primeval.
---
Ya boys ever seen a teammate with 15 motes invade and get instantly Izanagi'd?
---
Treat Gambit like a safari trip, you never know what fantastic specimen you'll meet today. Helps with the stress.
---
Wanna know how to beat OEM? Win the gunfight
---
"We are Legion. For we are many."
---
Titans, pressing F for skill since the end of the Golden age
---
Weekly Bounties give the most EXP, after that everything from Eris, then all the dailies.
---
Not just Titans, my friend!
---
Lurkers?
---
Loool
---
Mara sov got to smash Osiris
---
Dammits!!!
---
Why is that?
---
I'll hold you to that! Haha. Ok to drop a DM if I get stuck later down the line? Thanks again.
---
Yeah
---
*laughs in army* ok modren boomer
---
Bringing him back wouldnt even be that cheap if theres enough time between it... 
---
I mean its been years now hasnt it? Or atleast a year, we all miss him, and the world has changed... Bringing a younger cayde back (if we are talking about time travel) who didnt know about ghaul and all that (fuck maybe a cayde so young he wasnt even a vanguard yet) who needs to learn and re establish himself in the future, without tons of experience... Id like to see thst, and our "mentor" like cayde often was would still have that impact because the young cayde isnt on the same level
---
Wouldn't be so exotic anymore, right?
---
Is there any point in trying to do it solo?
---
Power 959 here, never had the courage to try it out yet üòÜ
---
Sure man! Anytime.
---
aaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAH!
---
No, that part of Destiny history was known as the Red War
---
*Laughs in completing Whisper 1st try with 2 seconds to spare, being praised by my teammates for finishing the job while they were down*
---
Ah, a fellow guardian who can also aim their guns.
---
Wait I misunderstood in the first place and forgot paradox had rampage already my bad
---
I think Vault stuff is as well, at least if you have the companion app, haven‚Äôt tried it in game yet.
---
Imagine if you could fight in game characters in crucible. And then there‚Äôs saint-14 that destroys as the strongest titan ever.
---
Also the foetracer tracking sucks
---
Plus S14 died in the Infinite Forrest, which may just be how he can be brought back
---
That too.
---
I don‚Äôt care if I ruin the streak. That‚Äôs amazing I‚Äôm proud of you.
---
*sees sundial*
---
‚ÄúNew plan! 
---
I‚Äôm gonna open this gate, time travel to the past, teleport to Uldren, shoot him in the face, and eat a sandwich.‚Äù
---
The Dawning event
---
This but poor af
---
If you talking about Season of Dawn = This starts next reset (Tuesday). 
---
If you are talking about the Dawning, the winter event - there is no date , yet. My guess would be the 17th, and it will run for 3 weeks.
---
Season pass exclusive
---
Taken dong
---
They low-key really boutta set up Uldren as the new Hunter Vanguard
---
Thing is we are not technically reviving saint-14 we are going ti grab him from a point in time where he was in the infinite forest and he im sure he will help us for a while but im guessing he for some reason will return to the infinite forest. 
---
Cayde was never in the infinite forest so we can‚Äôt pull him out if it and save him
---
Thank you fellow Guardian
---
Thanks!
---
This isn't an LFG sub.
---
Hm. That would be cool if it happens. Have the final part of the season (similar to VO: Final Assault) doesn't have a boss, instead the entire fireteam works together to break "our" fall. Have the model for the guardian be randomized based on fireteam members or perspective based.
---
One time I jumped inside a rock. I thought that was cool.
---
When you select the strike, you‚Äôll see off to the left, three little icons. The first one will tell you the elemental modifier for the week. Equip your subclass to match and take weapons that match as well for an added boost of damage! Good luck!
---
I'm in awe, u broke into and out of the ascendent plane. Titans are too OP now they're breakin physics ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I had it since the release mate
---
What did you do to make Eriana's a one shot? What load out, perks, etc?
---
Yall just straight up WRONG.
---
Holy shot I'm dumb
---
This is the truest post have ever seen
---
waiting itself is risky expecially if you stand still, the few times i play crayon eater in crucible i wait for them to dance, dance for a bit and then exit the bubble to get my free weapons of light kill
---
It's pretty much a rainforest 
---
With all the fruit and such lol
---
Cayde has to stay dead even just for the sake of bungies story telling ability. If they bring him back it reduces the impact of everything they‚Äôve done and will do, because then we‚Äôll just think ‚Äúoh well we can undo that just like cayde‚Äù saint 14 is an exception just because he‚Äôs never been in the story
---
No. Matchmaking in Gambit Prime is even worse than in Strikes.
---
Besides the usual PvE stuff, I mostly play Gambit Prime (regular Gambit is dumb af), so I've seen games where one side just gets absolutely stomped. Even the biggest beginner can pull some weight in Strikes, but if you don't exactly know what you have to do in Gambit Prime, you're dead weight. Period.
---
Here's why I write this: I had such a game of Gambit Prime with my clanmates yesterday. So 4 people with the same clantag, sitting in Discord, 2 of us with LOTS of Gambit Prime experience, against 4 random people that got shuffled together.
---
We annihilated them. When we killed our Primeval, they had around 15 motes in their bank. One of the 4 opponents left halfway through, another one of them finished with 0 (!) motes banked. The game wasn't fun for them at all and it was only fun for us because it was so absurd that the game gave us these opponents in the first place.
---
tl;dr: Gambit Prime needs a 4-man fireteam sub-mode (like the 1 player Survival queue) where only fireteams of exactly 4 people can join and fight against each other. Add rewards like increased Infamy points or something to that mode and I'll be happy.
---
minus Zavala.  He is a total pussy
---
Can u remind me which nightfall it is for the ordeal?
---
Same meme
---
Different text color
---
Requires some set up though. All power to you!
---
I'm very close to finishing mine, I can try to help if you find a 3rd
---
Maybe I was a bit lose with the definition?  Is suicide to avoid giving the other team a point not considered a cheese?  I recall that being a huge problem when Gambit first came out.
---
Okay cool
---
Probably the same place all exos were made. The deep stone crypt.
---
It's been nice and shiny in my collections page since threat level/1-2 punch shotguns arrived.
---
We have the Karnstein Armlets which restore a portion of your health and regenerate the rest over time, being damaged doesn‚Äôt stop the regeneration either until the perk stops.
---
Saint XIV was the first Commander of the Titans &amp; the Vanguard. He was responsible for the death of millions of Fallen &amp; quadruple that of Vex. He was regarded as the best Titan ever. He‚Äôs been dead in the Infinite Forest for quite some time but now he‚Äôs back
---
That's like when Richard brought child John Locke a pocket watch that future John Locke gave to Richard to show present day John Locke.
---
Lol. I mean wait as in run off after other players not stand by the bubble and wait them out. That a really dumb move. I don't even give them a chance to dance for long. Once my rose falls to the ground anyone around Is dead.
---
wasn‚Äôt cayde made in clovis bray and ada in niobe labs? where on ishtar collective can i read more about exos?
---
They need to nerf the titan melee and warlock grenade and this is coming from me a warlock main
---
So is he an exo? Hence the XIV
---
Yes he is
---
Yea it looks like it shoots an arc-web-like round that damages nearby guardians after a kill. Like some type of Kill Clip with AoE.
---
Thanks man. I'm trying to get up to speed as much as possible.
---
^ what the other guy said. Also, Byf on YouTube has some great lore videos for Destiny if you want to do some "homework." I'm certain he has some lore on Saint-14
---
Ada is pretty much the only non Clovis bray exo.
---
Luckily to prepare I‚Äôve just been running it without breach refractor and with Nezarac‚Äôs Sin and high discipline it only takes maybe 4-5 kills to get a grenade back with Devour :)
---
Because for some of those sweaty players, this is the only thing in life that they are good at. To each their own.
---
I can easily imagine Zavala calling for multiple wipes during their time as a fireteam.
---
You broke the chain :( The joke is that the number just keeps getting bigger. Pretty popular on Path of Exile subreddit cuz of confusing wording on items that requires way too much explanation.
---
My only issue with this is. Bungo will have to be very careful with not repeating the failure of season of the drifter for being too focused on one activity. And how can you have a shaxx dlc without crucible
---
I need to do that still. I really wanna Masterwork my outbreak
---
Obviously, it would have to have some sort of PVE content.  they did this in D1 with saladin, so its doable, but i really wish they had a big PVP expansion of some sort.  quest lines other than gaining one pinnacle weapon per season.  
---
Not a grind, but just something else to do.  D1 was the first FPS game I ever played and I literally had no clue and hated PVP.  After a while, I started to enjoy it, mostly because of the IB rewards that were given way back in the day.  Then I started playing it more when content in PVE was dull.  Now, PVE is what I do after burning an entire weekend in PVP and need a break from the sweat.  lol
---
more people need to get involved in PVP and for those who are not good at it, there needs to be a special place for them as well.  
---
I think creating dead zones or something similar to how division had where you can still do PVE, but you can be a target of PVP people too would be fun.
---
Dude one of the best parts of this game is the lore. U should read up.  He served as the first Titan Vanguard and was far more suited for the job than Zavala and served as the Speaker‚Äôs right hand. He fought in the Battle of Six Fronts.  He‚Äôs a Greek badass exo Titan (the OG Titan).
---
I'm sure you can do the same with Warlocks well of radiance or the Pheonix dive
---
Definitely a meme made by someone without Divinity (or they don‚Äôt know how to use it... recurrence?)
---
Hunters got Warmind and Forsaken
---
Time to quit your Titan and become a hunter gang. We make up for our lack of vanguard with numbers.
---
Awaken! Awaken! Awaken!
---
You've clearly never used, or you just suck at crucible.
---
I would say Zavala is the only "sane" and "cautious" Titan.
---
as a warlock, I will translate. Grape punchy boy, silver boom boom cannon, kill big bad vex and die
---
And dont forget to accidentally dodge into walls that definitely werent there a second ago. Really important, write that down.
---
No really, write it down..
---
Yeah... This is the problem though. Its not really fair to other classes if one class gets the ability to track *and* heal with an exotic. 
---
So from my opinion/point of view, we either have everyone be broken, or no one.
---
What if we kill him again with his own gun by "accident" again?
---
Saint 14 was not killed by the undying mind he was killed by a directive that the vex programed in the forest that drained him of his light. But you might be right about him being from another timeline
---
Tbf, your legendary figure is in this dlc too
---
Right. This is more or less what I had concluded. Thanks for the clarification.
---
I have to admit I am missing the friendly chatty vibe of WF. Nay mind.... Are things like discord worth looking at as substitutions? I am not familiar with the app personally. But see it mentioned a lot.
---
Thanks again.
---
I saw the sparrow for a brief second brother. I can only hope that it will be in the patrollable area.
---
Again?
---
How‚Äôd you do it?
---
Where did you land?
---
Can you get to the bridge that is at the top of everything?
---
IMAGINE disrespecting Saint-14 like that
---
Osiris?
---
To clarify my comment - I got to the jump puzzle part, died a few times, and then quit never to return.  I hate the super-Mario-shit jump puzzles.  A few jumps?  Ok. But 5 minutes worth?  Just no.  I will never get outbreak perfected.
---
He looks like a shotgun ape...
---
I do too lmao. Good luck my G
---
yep
---
Discord is mentioned a lot. I need to take a gander. Currently not used it. 
---
I play on PC. Thanks for the hints and tips. Much appreciated. I shall spread my wings a bit and see whats out there.
---
Thanky muchly.
---
&gt;au
---
I didn't say anything about changing the past...  
---
I literally only said could we witness historical events...? Jeeze.  
---
Causing problems that I'm not even posing.
---
I‚Äôd imagine this is how shaxx used to go into battle
---
Totally new and not reposted at least each weak idea.
---
I don't think you can, maybe an upgrade module or a bundle of legendary shards or enhancement cores? That's about the only things I can think of that would appease them. Especially the new light players that don't know how to farm them. Otherwise I feel like being able to play again AT ALL is reward enough. It makes me wish there was an offline mode where you can roam the sandbox of the EDZ, or do a crucible match with bots while you wait, or even just one of those little games like when the internet is out on Google chrome. most of the people who bitch about the game are people who mainly play it, and very little else adding something like this would certainly shut them up for a while
---
Yup yup. Osiris was one of the big.legends, as well as the previous warlock vanguard before Ikora AND the vanguard commander before Zavala. Not to mention, technically he is dummy powerful too! Basically being in perma radiance (d1 sunsinger instead of dawblade) during one of the great battles and just burning every fallen that attempted to attack him.
---
I did not see that, I might have to go re-inspect the clip to see what you‚Äôre talking about
---
Great minds think alike. Looking at post history it seems like mine was first???
---
True, but if you look up at him he's clearly talking to one side of the room.
---
I don‚Äôt give a fuck what it takes. Bring back cayde and pay Nathan Fillion to voice him.
---
Cayde-6 and sweeper-bot for life!
---
I made this in a drawing app and i couldn't make the picture fit the frame
---
Anyone have any idea where the Lunar Scavengers are this week? I checked the weekly infographic but couldn't find the info I was looking for.
---
I did the pulse rifle and the auto rifle each week and they always counted. Maybe some of the frames are bugged.
---
But why bringing him back would ruin the timeline because he had to die for the events of forsaken to unfold. The reason we can bring saint 14 back is because he "died" in the infinite forest
---
In one of the lore entries, Mara Sov teleported Shaxx to her and handed him a copy of Shakespeare's "The Tempest." Shax burned it up and said "I know it by heart." And recited the entire thing to her from memory.
---
And the helmet stayed on the entire time.
---
I have a clan on Xbox but no discord ‚òπÔ∏è
---
I just recently got it.
---
It does. Its just a random exotic drop now, good luck. I actually got mine from one of the exotic engrams in the season pass.
---
eh, we've dealt with shoulder charge and handheld supernova, its time to let us have our ohk back as well. 
---
Still sad the tripmine nerf is still in effect though.
---
https://itswednedaywhywouldxurbehere.com
---
Are you using top or bottom tree gunslinger?
---
 Honestly the Vanguard Dare stuff is the ONE (1) thing I‚Äôd actually pay the microtransactions for. Until that‚Äôs in the store, the season pass is the extent of my silver buying
---
Wait! No! If Shaxx becomes a fan-favorite they will kill him off just like they did Cayde! Don‚Äôt do it.
---
Speculation:  high caliber side arm - shoots really hard round but slower
---
Actually, just a hand cannon.  Have fun!
---
You do it on purpose to emphasize the end of the word
---
Also incest if that's the case.
---
Hunters don't get any legendary figures because all of them are dead and Daddy Shin is still to come back from the liqour store.
---
Holy fuck yes! I think the main thing stopping them is getting enough of Lenny James' time to do all the dialog.   
---
BTW, if you're not familiar with James' body of work... you should really get to work fixing that. His performance in the cult TV series Jericho cemented him as one of my favorite actors, and honestly I haven't seen anything he's been in that wasn't at least fun to watch!
---
Wow. Sploosh ü§≠
---
Sunbracers? Naw those are Icebracers. You can see it is not yellow/orange like fire it is white. But in all seriousness how would an ice element subclass sound?
---
Shaxx was the only one to ever do the fucky with mara
---
You mean in a Ward of Dawn, right?
---
Your PvE content could be the Red Jacks go nuts and you have to destroy them, you get a 6 man match-made group and go to PvP maps where you face hordes of Red Jacks as your seasonal activity. We get a new enemy type and can reuse a ton of assets already in the game.
---
Also would be nice to get new crucible themed weapons and armor after so many seasons of not having anything new.
---
Dude, it's royalty... there's ancient tradition to uphold!
---
Be careful what you wish for I'm sure people wanted Cayde-6 dlc too and we all know how it ends.
---
Correct
---
He's feels mistrust towards the light, and when he became a lightbearer there were no classes
---
 PVE‚Äî
---
**Q1. How can I engage with challenging PVE content? I have been rolf stomping everything for the last 6 hours and at 850LL, don't have any interest in doing more of the same.**
---
You can do 750 raids. Don't let the recommended light level fool you: your power will scale down to requirement+20 if you are too strong.
---
**Q2. What do I use glimmer for? I have never played a game with such a useless currency.**
---
Upgrading, infusions, applying mods, tithe for Chalice runes, buying bounties, Tribute Hall unlocks (mainly for Bad Juju and the catalyst. Used about 100k glimmer for that just today)
---
**Q3. What generally do I use legendary shards for, bright dust, etc?**
---
Shards: buying shaders and such from collections tab, buying exotics from Xur (uses up almost 200 shards a week), buying enhancement cores and materials from Spider in Tangled Shore, upgrading gear, Tribute Hall, Banshee-44
---
Dust: Eververse. Also Tribute Hall.
---
Destination materials: Tribute Hall, Banshee-44, vendors around the solar system.
---
Tokens: their relevant vendors
---
**Q4. Should I continue to break down every weapon that is not as high as my highest LL?**
---
If the weapons feel good to use, infuse a higher power weapon into them to keep them relevant instead of deleting them.
---
**Q5. Should I continue to turn in vendor tokens as I get them?**
---
Yes. No reason to hoard them.
---
PVP‚Äî
---
**Q1. Do Exotics work in PVP?**
---
Yes.
---
**Q2. Does light level mean anything in PVP?**
---
Only in Iron Banner (a rotating Crucible gamemode that awards pinnacle gear) and for Gambit PvP (does not matter for the Gambit PvE portion). Elsewhere it doesn't.
---
If you haven't,  this.  There are a lot of easy menagerie triumphs, take a look in the menu and aim to knock some out.
---
PVE: The most difficult content would likely be dungeons, which you should do solo or with 1 other team member for the best experience. These are not matchmade as far as I can tell. Nightfall are the same, but pay attention to the recommended light of any activity you do.
---
Glimmer is used to slot mods, occasionally buy items for spider and infuse or masterwork items to around 4 out of 10. You will generally have much more than you need, as everything awards glimmer
---
Not bring him back. More like a brief appearance. Kindly like how Saint 14 might end up being.
---
I think you mean Hive, cause we haven't had enough Hive dlc yet.
---
It appears so.

Saint 14 for hunter vanguard 
---
Idc if hes a titan
---
Go for the eyes boo!
---
If it saves to your photo gallery you could crop it in there next time. Just an idea. Good meme tho
---
Is Black Armory locked behind Forsaken campaign tho? I bought the dlc, did all the stuff to get my Izanagi, and then finished campaign for Ace. Also anyone can access forges not just forsaken peeps.
---
Lmao. Makes sense I guess. They. Or at least gunslingers, pride themselves on running alone anyways lol
---
Better him than bitch ass zavala
---
&gt;You just do whatever and a random team wins
---
Wins are decided by the Drifter's coin-toss pre-match, he just wants you to *think* your activity means something
---
No. Stop. If he was brought back then his death would have no meaning.
---
Shaxx vs Saladin DLC
---
I can see the JoJo memes now.
---
Saladin: Oh? Your approaching me? Instead of running away your coming straight to me? Even though your friend. Cayde-6, told you the power of my Fist of havoc, like an exam student scrambling to finish before the chime? 
---
Shaxx: I can‚Äôt beat the shit out of you without getting closer
---
Saladin: HO HO! Then come as close as you like!
---
*insert Dio (Saladin) and Jotaro (Shaxx) walking panel here*
---
Izanagi get this sniper,  it's a monster
---
Get the izanagi catalyst, in the heroic menagerie, see an tutorial to get this
---
Wendigo Gl3, an insane grenade launcher that everyone needs
---
Love and death with the god roll, see an god roll tutorial on youtube, its the grenade launcher of moon
---
The Iron Banner grenade Launcher, one of the highest dps on the game
---
The recluse, the competitive smg, an monster 
---
The mountaintop grenade launcher, an crucible quest.
---
For the exotic armor of titan, you need the saint-14 helmet, very good at some raids.
---
These are my favorite guns for PvE, some of this guns are essential in raids, like the izanagi for the Garden of Salvation
---
I've had some time to give the situation some thought now, and I strongly suspect that it's going to have something to do with the fact that Saint-14 died in the Infinite Forest (or at least on Mercury, where the timeline is fucked) rather than anywhere else. That'd be an easy way for Bungie to avoid the whole "BUT WE COULD HAVE SAVED CAYDE" thing. All just speculation at this point, obviously, but I have a feeling they're going to use specific circumstances to their advantage.
---
Was with a two stack who like OP described were holding 13-14 motes. We needed 2 so I ran and grabbed 2, on my way to the bank one of the Jabroni‚Äôs who wouldn‚Äôt bank starts shooting at me as I‚Äôm running to say stop or something, and my clanmate is at the bank watching this unfold dying of laughter. 
---
PSA: Bank when the drifter tells you.
---
CAYDE GET UP I NEED MOTES BROTHaaaAaahhahha
---
Celestial Nighthawk, Finite thoughts x3, and melting point
---
I FUCKING KNEW WHAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN
---
Anyone can access the forges but you can‚Äôt get the legendary frame quest until you are at a certain point to see spider and finish a few quests. But that is just how I did it.
---
That sounds like quitter talk to me
---
Weapon loader perks that worked with any armor should be in the base game.
---
This "elemental" bullshit needs to end.
---
North Star main, can confirm I live in constant fear of Legion.
---
&gt;how do you quantify the value of a day offline
---
2 tokens and a blue
---
Strange why so many people want him back. It's like, what did he even do? Say some dumb quips (usually at inappropriate times)? Give you locations to chests with useless crap in them? He died for a good story, so he should stay dead.
---
How long varies from player to player.  Just play a bunch of comp.
---
disgusting
---
Saint 14 is the raid boss for...
---
Jez The Titan Slayer, Slayer of all Titans
---
BY THE POPE!
---
I‚Äôll have to remember that in case I ever have to do Shattered Throne again
---
"something something timetravel only works within the forest so only people who died there can be brought back something something"
---
sounds sciency enough to be true...
---
I don‚Äôt think so. But I‚Äôm kinda hit and miss with improving my light level. I just do pinnacles every week
---
We've had him for far longer than a day and a half. Those of us who completed the mission in Curse of Osiris know well what he means to us all.
---
Your moms gonna smell the fake blunt kid
---
Nah. Powerful fill out the rest of your stuff.
---
You've been....
---
THUNDERSTRUCK.

Saint 14 be smoking that cookie

Nope once you get all 950 gear start to go for pinnacle gear

Pulse, Auto, HC, Swords are what counted for me.

You wanna hot box my bubble

I couldn't quite remember where exactly I had read it, but by strange chance [I happened to blunder onto the right bit of lore.](https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/illicit-reaper-bond?highlight=Drifter+ghost)

Lol you basically just said why should I rely on mechanics

its good to get more for infusion

Yo just get the companion app and you can transfer equipment in and out of the vault and between characters at any time while you‚Äôre playing. ‚ÄúOh shit, I want to use sweet business but I forgot it in my vault! Oh wait, I just transferred it to my character from my phone and I have it now.‚Äù
---
Season
---
I know it‚Äôs just great to see him alive.
---
makes sense to me
---
It‚Äôs the guy from Thebes in Hercules you uncultured fuck
---
Hey, I like Oded Fehr as Osiris.... I feel like if he can kill a Mummy and Zombies, that muther fucker gets mad respect!
---
I'm all in for a shaxx dlc. But that would probably be a crucible DLC, in which case I'll flee from it like it's the pest
---
the first sunbreaker-defender
---
Remember when like 20 Osirises show up to dawnblade that one Vex mind? It's like that.
---
He's a robot, he doesn't count.
---
Besides, he *was* way more enjoyable to be around than Ikora and Zavala.
---
Technically you're not creating a new ghost, that's just the SHELL. It's like a chassis, or armor. The actual ghost is the silver sphere in the center and you only get one of those. Everything else is just a new costume for the same core
---
Thing is, I don't think Cayde's death was an intended outcome. Variks lost his damn mind and let everybody out before disappearing somewhere beyond the Reef. IF Cayde's death was a planned result, it was probably a grudge over the fact he shot and captured Fikrul.
---
he is a snitch fo' sho' (with snoop dogg voice)
---
I was convinced that Warlocks were the ones that wielded true power with their light.
---
I was wrong.
---
Thanks for all the info. I started up the download last night but didn't realize I needed to free up space on my hard drive. Probably won't be able to play until tomorrow. Did they ever add auto matching for raids or anything like that? I'm sure all of the older ones are outdated and don't give great rewards, but I never got to experience them so I'd like to at least once.
---
Fair, it is a good story
---
Damn. Good point. Guess I‚Äôll just fourth wall break and make a new account, as it‚Äôll get a ghost too. Still a viable solution to prevent extinction

glad i didnt pay ahead of time for all the passes, yikes
---
Randy's does not take longer than Redrix.
---
Randy's is one step with really the only grindy bit being 300 scout kills.
---
Redrix literally requires 350 pulse kills (150 of which are crits), 75 double kills (150 kills) and 150 elemental kills. On top of 75 crucible matches in 3 seperate modes. That's 650 kills. Randy's has got nothin on that
---
Im fine with there not being a raid, if there was a raid it would likely be rushed and garbage
---
Could have sworn I read something about Pirrha hunting lightbearers other than just Cayde, implying there was more than one devourer bullet. Might be entirely wrong, though. I can't remember where I read it, so I'm going to assume I'm misremembering something.
---
ü§°
---
I guess but that‚Äôs the only reason I come back I have nothing else to do on it other than raid for fun

He says while whining to a comment about whining to a comment about a comment whining to a comment whining about a comment whining.
---
Current - Ace of spades or Bygones (kill clip,  outlaw), fate cries foul (i'll use any sniper with a higher impact/range) (at least 70 impact above 60 range) then w/e grenade launcher or heavy I have at the time. I rock it with Ursa or Skullfort, but want to try dunemarchers or synthaceps.
---
There was no pinnacle gear before shadowkeep so we wont know how drops will be until next week.
---
What weapons are you using?
---
I‚Äôd think so.  Haven‚Äôt heard any different.
---
Bitch please, I've been all three since D1Y1.  If I neglect any of them, it'll be my Warlock since I hate the floof jumping (which is more of a PvE gripe), which is also probably why RNJesus seems to like my Warlock better than the others, but I digress.  You on the other hand, well, people can look at your comment history.  What was that about playing all three classes again?

Oh thats just the beginning.

https://www.ishtar-collective.net/categories/saint-14?highlight=Saint+14
---
Also, Saint-14 was so powerful and so feared by the Vex that when they finally killed him they built him a shrine:
---
‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I think we should leave him here. It looks like the Infinite Forest laid him to rest. Built him a‚Ä¶ memorial. Did the Vex learn to respect him?‚Äù
---
‚ÄúSaint-14 must have been here for years. Decades. He ran out of ammo, and just‚Ä¶ kept fighting.‚Äù
---
Dude was the essence of titan.
---
**BREAKING**: Hive Thrall obliterated by suspected sentient asteroid; "*GrkKKkKKAAAAAACHHHH,*" say Hive officials
---
Same here. Haha. I figured I was gonna have to shell out more money sooner than later.
---
I love and hate this. I laughed but said "F**k... He's not wrong."
---
Great, now I'm imagining Kelsey Grammer in an Egyptian robe
---
As in Forsaken and Shadowkeep? Isn‚Äôt that the only campaigns that can be replayed outside of heroics?
---
PSA i‚Äôm not worried about ranks i need the pinnacle weaponsüòÇüòÇ
---
I‚Äôm like lv40 something lol I knew I shouldn‚Äôt of taken a break
---
I think it‚Äôs a safe assumption it will only because no new sources of pinnacle gear have been announced.  But yeah, only bungie knows for sure at this point.
---
Humanity was fundamentally changed. Their life span was tripled. The gravity and atmospheres of planets were changed. People that had been dead for centuries were resurrected into new bodies. The Awoken were created out of basically nothing but Light and Darkness meeting, and dropped in a place (The Distributary) where they are immortal. 
---
Not to mention the workings of the Hive (Ascendant Plane, Throne Worlds, the Deathsong, Oryx and "taking")
---
This is more than just "tech mistaken for magic." 
---
The laws of the universe changed
---
Saint-14 can only be ‚Äúbrought back‚Äù because he‚Äôs already time displaced. Saint probably won‚Äôt even stick around after the season. He‚Äôll probably be sent back to the beginning of the city to help build it and fill in those plot threads we already have in lore. Then he‚Äôs got to die again. If saint doesn‚Äôt die, then we didn‚Äôt fix the timeline
---
[deleted]
---
Just a single Hunter that revived, never really speaks to anyone, and only when asked for his name, simply says "*Cayde-7.*" and doesn't understand why people are so taken aback.
---
No statement about an increase so far and it really wouldn't make sense with &gt;99% of the playerbase not even having 960 gear yet.
---
So is this how they‚Äôre going to bring Cayde back?
---
Light levels will most likely remain exactly the same as they are now.  Those are usually reserved for large scale DLC updates, not smaller season changes like this.  The only thing that's changing is that bonus light is resetting so you'll need to grind EXP to get bonus power again.

---
We need Shaxx to be gay for Zavala.
---
Change my mind.
---
I think we should leave all that behind. The story is in dark places now because the city‚Äôs situation is becoming more dire. Throwing in some jokes everyone really dampens the effect. Like that other guy said, year 1 had too much of that
---
Cayde AI, Ryan Reynolds, Sagira, Gordon Ramsey or a higher pitch  Lord Shaxx as a ghost voice are all something that would be acceptable.
---
For a new player, it's about getting items - even if they are bad, it's still shards which are important at the start, for getting exotics at Xur. 
---
The general process is asking yourself, "does it drop anything I might enjoy or need?"
---
Yeah true because money

it's useless until you get  a pinnacle in every slot save two, then your powerful rewards can boost your light level a bit.  Basically, it'll make up for some gaps if you get screwed on pinnacles (like me, last 5 pinnacle rewards have been hunter cloaks).
---
I did all the campaings three times with different characters
---
Reminder that there's an awful chance that Saint-XIV will get the Cayde or Osiris treatment, and either:
---
1) Be built up to be super cool and amazing and then turn out to be incompetent and keep causing problems with the Vex (*Like Osiris*)
---
2) Be used basically just for comedic relief (*Like Cayde*)
---
Is that SRL?!
---
Well, I know there's a hidden triumph that gives you exotic ship when you forge 100 weapons, so it would be close to impossible to get it if it was only possible to make one gun a week.
---
?????
---
Get em boys!
---
All I have to do is finish that strike quest with the shaders and emblem and I‚Äôll be good for the title! My 9th one to boot.
---
Yup and the reason Osiris was made Vangaurd. Saint was pretty devoted to the city and the speaker‚Äôs word. Pretty suited for vanguard I‚Äôd say
---
Just go and play what you enjoy - no point in doing something that's no fun.
---
They all have different loot pools, but on top of that - no.
---
Weapon types - whatever enables you to kill stuff. Same for mods, they basically just make things a little easier.
---
Thats the spirit!! Pew pew pew!!
---
PvE &gt; PvP
---
This was my first season playing comp and I got in done in like 4 hours. It's not hard at all
---
It‚Äôs fun.
---
Skill based match making at its finest. Working as intended. But watch those awesome new cosmetics in the eververse.
---
I'm just saying shoulder charge isn't that good.
---
It disappears
---
Your teammates bailed while you were loading in. Nothing to do with the game or its systems.
---
The items on the shelf/surface behind him say ‚Äòlol‚Äô
---
Theyd be better off just grinding bounties for the whole season. If they don't up the pinnacle cap to at least 970 it's gonna annoy a lot of ppl already at 960 base.
---
People are expecting way too much nowadays
---
Less than a week left, I'm really hyped for those changes.
---
As someone who got game on black friday and has only hit rank 27 on seasons pass i dont think i will hit 100 in 5 days lol
---
THATS why it seemed familiar
---
FACK he's right.
---
I don't need sleep, I need the cloak universal ornament
---
You hella salty titans can do anything a hunter can
---
Are you just posting this everywhere in the thread?
---
Do you have proof that it's another reprised engram?
---
Pretty sure Saint-14 gave up being the Titan Vanguard to go look for Osiris
---
I hope so but even if I doesn‚Äôt happen this season looks promising
---
This. I want this. I vote for this.
---
There‚Äôs 2 guardians and 2 sparrows
---
boy got the pack lol
---
Bruh r/yourjokebutworse
---
Me too. I wonder how the melee/fireball attack will feel in the crucible! It really does make the warlock feel more like a space wizard.
---
&lt;\3 ;(
---
Shinobu‚Äôs vow üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Last year every season got +50. Id be really disappointed if they didn't even up the pinnacle cap to like 970 for this season. Else ppl that are 960 from grinding pinnacles have literally no incentive to do pinnacle stuff next season. They'd be better just sweating bounties. Surely +10 on pinnacles can't be a hard thing to do per season.
---
Just glitch into the whisper mission to practice 5head
---
Bruh Crimson Days was skip nade city with that garbage lol
---
Lol wrong dude though
---
That‚Äôs cool
---
Yeah im fine with it between the console versions but i don't want crossplay with the PC port.
---
Kinda suck that they‚Äôre not bringing back Trials of Osiris but yeah, other than that everything look really good
---
It's still a yr 3 raid. Last wish still gave powerful gear during season of opulance.
---
Thank fuck for my DD-214. 
---
I feel you though. Shit sucks.
---
We've done an expansion which was primarily Vex and Hive (Shadowkeep/Undying), now we have one that's primarily Cabal and Vex (Dawn), so if we're not going back to the Fallen well so soon the only option left is primarily Hive and Cabal.  (And after that we get Vex and Hive again, assuming no further wrinkle, so that would be the best opportunity to take another crack at the curse)
---
How do you get to 950 so fast? I just started playing and its taking me forever to catch up
---
Subjunctive won't be around next season probably
---
So farm it in the next week
---
I had some gear from my other characters that was already 950.
---
Ohh, that's sad.
---
Damn man you went through so much just to reveal that you have cancer too? RIP In pepperoni 
---
All jokes aside, that looks CLEAN! Gotta get me the Tricorn tattoo sometime
---
Ohhh okay yeah that makes more sense lol
---
It looks like he has the same issue as me, which is the quest step is displaying as The Ascent, but the objective is the be Brave rank. Pretty sure it's broken.
---
If you bought the digital delux of shadowkeep you got season of the undying the rest of the content for Y3 (including dawn, and what comes after.
---
I don't know who the dude is but I'm sick of seeing his face.

This honestly deserves more upvotes. Here's mine

Only gambit prime gives you 2% everything else is 1%

I switched to Vow on primeval near the end, still counts
---
I think you animated the gyroscope really well, especially for pixel art where it can be tricky to illustrate rotations the way you want. I never played D1 but I could tell that it was something rotating.
---
I'm wondering how Wish-Ender would look now haha.
---
Still won‚Äôt be as long as charging tho.
---
Also dodge? Fucking op
---
I'd support this if Bungie could actually balance crucible instead of constantly buffing Warlocks, who were the least skill-based at launch of D1.
---
2%
---
it‚Äôs a lovely idea, but bungo doesn‚Äôt listen to this sub
---
Strange picture, they're about to kill their father/ husband after he just cut the grass
---
I know what it is, I have one, but find that it's far more practical in pve than pvp.
---
Lol it really split? Like THAT many people are crybabies about a video game? The new stuff looks cool as hell, what‚Äôs there to complain about? The greatest Titan is gonna be here in some way for a whole season, Mercury probably isn‚Äôt going to be known as the absolute worst piece of trash destination anymore, and the new armor and weapons look dope so far.
---
Easiest way to get runes is to buy them from Benedict (who's on the floating barge on Nessus).  You'll also get several from his weekly bounties.  The rune combo for Beloved is a Rune of Jubilation (a purple) in slot one, whatever red rune you like in slot 2.
---
Yes. There are that many.
---
He's gonna be pissed when he gets back to the Tower and sees all of us in them.
---
yup. him, andal brask, and osiris
---
I feel you to the max right now
---
Season of the Unbroken

We need a Cayde DLC that follows the steps that made him who he was

Sadly my friend and I came back to destiny with new light and we cannot find a chill relaxed group to teach us raids, it‚Äôs always some cocky asshole who just assumes we know what to do even though it‚Äôs stated upfront we need help learning. As a result it‚Äôs prevented us from wanting to even try them and we loved them in D1
---
I'm super pumped for everything. I wish there was more PvP stuff but I'm really happy about the map that's returning. It was one of my favorites from D1
---
Saint-14 died killing a strike boss that I farmed 4 hours straight to get an Imago Loop that I never used
---
Do raids when you have the pinnacle weapons, whisper, wendigo and recluse at the very least IMO
---
Thats like 60% of the split. PvP.
---
doom
---
YES finally someone who understands!
---
As a Hunter main, this is absolutely true. We all needed a second strong titan figure around cause let's be honest. Zavala ain't a strong titan figure
---
Too much irrelevant info about your acc. Just post a meme, sir.
---
Titans, warlocks and hunters... we all hate Zavala
---
I'm sorry dude but have you been playing Destiny 2 under a rock?
---
we could youse sparrows in the trostland tho
---
Keyword being tried
---
Or at least one where Shaxx, Saladin, and Zavala resolve their beef since the Battle of the Twilight Gap
---
Cool didn't know that! That's actually a really useful tip!
---
Meh, did not even kill anyone. What's the point in that "titan" thing then?
---
I know who Saint 14 is. I'm talking about the guy in the meme.
---
What if there is an even where they stand next to each other and whichever one decrypts more engrams becomes the tower cryptarc (someone correct me I forgot how to spell it)
---
AND COLONEL!
---
From my experience it warlock and titan positions tend to flip flop
---
I believe this will be a new titan meta in Crucible.  Towering barricade + melee.  Time to start stacking paragon mods.
---

Much better.

I used Jade Rabbit for a while when momentum control fist came around, it was just to get the catalyst completed. During my grind to get the catalyst, I got the SUROS Regime catalyst. Dual speed receiver game me an advantage in mid range engagements. Got that Jade catalyst done and swapped to the regime. Got that done and went to my Duke Mk. 44 with rampage, ricochet round and rapid hit plus an Icarus Grip.

I've run it 100+ times chasing a god roll optative.  Hunting a max range rapid hit kill clip roll.   If it wasn't for the guaranteed drop each run I probably would have just ran it 3 times and given up.  Also with all those runs I did most of the Vow quest and catalyst kill farming there.   Had the kills for the title nearly done before I ever even looked at the requirements.

I also need a clan on PC. What's your clan info?

Step4: have the colonel blow or eat up Cayde-6s ashes while I keep a small bit of the ashes
---
Step5: shoot myself with ace because a world without Cayde-6 is one I don't want to live in oh God why did he have to dieeeeeeee
---
You make entirely valid points.
---
Be fun if my title wasn‚Äôt bugged or sum shit
---
3 mediocre weapons? But I only see 1 bow.
---
Which are you favorites? I wasn't impressed, but the rolls I got all sucked I think.
---
The Russian accent is just the icing on the cake. Love it!
---
Agreed
---
As a warlock main. This could not be more true. I wanna be like saint -14 when I grow up!
---
Oh man, right in the feels
---
no one gonna mention baby yoda killed him?
---
Warlocks made out the best in this game aside from the hard to use jumps. They can do both parts of the game instead of being great in one and completely outclassed in the other.
---
Gotta love how a hero carries themselves
---
Are you talking about Whisper or the actual Spindle?
---
Whisper of the worm? I get confused between the two (the io one)
---
He's been around since Deatiny 1, his exotic helm in that game was literally game changing. It gave Titans a huge purpose outside of just an armor/weapon boost bubble. 
---
Source: Titan main since D1 beta

Try this handheld supernova https://youtu.be/l7u3Ah9bp-Y build
---
It still bounces, unless you don't hold the trigger.
---
Lol....that Subtle Calamity is so hard to use after getting the black armory bow Spiteful Fang. Working on getting the Hush.
---
I don't think he should be brought back, but meeting him again  would be nice
---
Everyone would go to Tyra cause fuck rahool
---
Zavala was just the student. Saint-14 was the Legend.
---
This is why I get shoulder charged going through walls and two Hunter jumps above them
---
It‚Äôs true though. Bringing Cayde back would be like bringing back a dead loved one. You get to live with them for the rest of your life, but when you die, they‚Äôre still there. They continue to live forever and ever until time is no more, because they are not real. Cayde was real (in the Destiny universe at least), and bringing him back would make him a worse character for me, and I feel like it‚Äôs the same with other people too.
---
If you‚Äôre talking about the actual fight, I‚Äôm sorry, but you‚Äôre just wrong. 
---
As a boss though, yeah he‚Äôs pretty fucking badass
---
He'd let you have the first punch.
---
Gotcha. You can retry as often as you want. You‚Äôll just need to wait for that public event again so you can kill the secret guy and spawn the anomaly.
---
One less loose end
