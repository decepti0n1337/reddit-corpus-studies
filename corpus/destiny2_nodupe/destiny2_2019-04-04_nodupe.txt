It‚Äôs the (second) most Quake or Tribes-like interaction in the game lol. First being two Mountaintops, but like, that means you have to use get and use Mountaintop

Or you could not be lazy and put effort into making your posts look nice instead of looking unprofessional and annoying to look at?
---
our RNG is so random you get things you already have
---
Yes.
---
Vault of glass is hands-down my favorite part of any game. 
---
Tell me your secrets. My suckage is great. 
---
Not in reckoning 
---
You can get a better roll than the curated from a rep package with Vanguard just by doing Strikes &amp; stuff and turning in the tokens, you don‚Äôt even have to get the special one in order for it to show up in the loot pool.
---
How the hell do you aim with that thing?
---
Gotta use direct screen capture man, no photos of screen
---

---
Removing this sorry man. 
---
If you haven't finished the mini quest line for gambit prime, it won't show up. You have to finish that first. Hope this helps. 
---
I‚Äôm having a really bad time in the crucible rn..
---
Queenbreaker: Front end of the scope
---
Whisper: Back end of the scope
---
Two Tailed Fox: The pink part at the top of the body of the gun
---
Wavesplitter: Behind the two tailed fox part, on the other side of the gun there is one of the charging cylinders on the side of wavesplitter
---
Anarchy: In front of the two tailed fox part, top of the gun body
---
Legend of Acrius: The stock of the gun. In addition, the golden circle on the two tailed fox part if from the side of legend of acrius
---
One Thousand Voices: On top of the stock
---
Riskrunner: One of the blue energy cores on the back of riskrunner is attached to the underside of the stock
---
Ace of Spades: The main grip of the gun. The perks are also from Ace of spades
---
Thorn: The cylinder from thorn is directly above the grip, towards the back of the gun
---
Lord of Wolves?: I'm not certain about this one, but the magazine looks similar to the Lord of wolves magazine
---
Worldline Zero: The thing on the bottom of the magazine is from the hilt of worldline zero
---
Le Monarque: The small glowing purple thing under the gun is actually the head of one of Le Monarque's arrows without the tip.
---
Wardcliff Coil: The big metal ball with holes in it is the front end of Wardcliff Coil.
---
Vigilance Wing: The golden wings on the botton of the gun
---
Izanagi's Burden: The main barrel of the gun
---
Fighting Lion: The front end of the barrel
---
Crimson: The knife on the underside of the barrel
---
That's everything I could find.
---
Work on getting better at game modes you suck at atm and dominate us all
---
As a dedicated gamer in my mid 40s I‚Äôve played it ALL. Since pong and the 2600 it‚Äôs been a part of my life. Destiny is the only game I play and have time for any longer. Not only is it my favorite game but prob my favorite media in general. I hope it never dies and continues to grow like WOW. 
---
Jesus christ accurate
---
nah got my own clan and team
---
Simulation*
---
I see super good advice in there 
---
No off topic posts sorry man. 
---
Gotta remove this. 
---
I get that in under two hours just by playing and stocking up on enhancement cores 
---
Stuff like this is why there really should be an official ‚Äúticket submission‚Äù that puts you in direct, person-to-person contact with real customer support. Major glitches/mistakes are admittedly rare but there‚Äôs got to be a way to address them when they do happen beyond posting in a public forum. A multi-million $$ game with hundreds of thousands of players (granted now Bungie is more independent they may not be worth as much but they‚Äôve never had a good system) should have dedicated customer service. 
---
What kind of company perma-bans people with absolutely no way to dispute it? And not even an acknowledgement of the cause of the ban? Tisk tisk bungie 
---
(P.s. please don't ban me, thanks) 
---
Year 1 gjallarhorn is still probably better though.

\*howls in Vex deletey gun\*

Yep, that's the D1 version at least.

Hey! I farmed to legendary on solo queue comp. I don't NEED my NF. I earned that shit!

Ooh, you can dish it out but nit take it? What a snowflake.
---
r/sharditkeepit
---
Right but celestial won‚Äôt give you all that energy back...the point is the reason Shards doesn‚Äôt get as much energy back on add kills as Skull does is because it also has the added benefit of easily getting 75% energy back for damaging a boss. Shards has worse regen but is viable in more scenarios where as Skull has better regen but is more limited in its use, it‚Äôs really not that hard to understand.
---
Yeah, why would you want to beat up destiny?!
---
Literally couldn't agree with you more. As a solo player in a multiplayer game, I feel the pain of attempting to get these pinnacle weapons and then failing, again and again. These changes would be appreciated by everyone who don't take an unhealthy amount of pride in winning PVP matches.
---
nice catch but if the other guy knew how to aim he could hit the forge from there
---
Done!
---
except its not the exact same, curtain call is much more similar to bad omens
---
Nah, no reason to continue talking to people like that. Too salty, what‚Äôs the point :D just gotta be smarter. You know a lot about taking eh?
---
It‚Äôs sad we actually have these complications, its makes you wonder if we will ever actually get these things lol
---
If you're still complaining about Colony you have no idea how to play the game and I have no respect for your opinions about the game from that point on. Literally just press space. That's it. Just jump over it and punch the person in the face.  Kinda sucks cause that used to be my absolute favorite gun and now it's just a joke. Needs something done to it.

"Unfortunately we do not have the ability to pull in every person that has played Destiny, only those that have been added to our database by others or by signing up."

A tracker that is designed to track PvP stats is going to get an inproportional amount of PvP players. Therefore Destiny tracker is skewed towards showing more PvP players than are actually in the database.
---
Most likely yeah
---
I cannot even IMAGINE D3 this fall
---
Im scared
---
What is an item squish 
---
I absolutely love my misfit, and I use night watch for the kinetic slot. Night watch isn‚Äôt the best scout ever, but I love that fast fire rate, plus it rolled with explosive bullets which is a plus. 
---
All I can think of is trying to tweet at Bungie and that seems like a longshot 
---
The original agreement was 2 year per game, but they fell behind on d1 and changed the DLC plan for d2.
---
A weapon that requires charge time and that the target basically stand still needs a nerf?
---
 It does track decently, but quick movement in any direction and you're in the clear. You might not need to aim with it, but it's not OP. It one shots just like any other fusion rifle or shotgun.
---
This would be perfect with the classic Jojo's bizarre adventure, "To be continued"
---
But they drop powerful and you can use them for infusing legendaries without wasting an enhancement core...
---
Is this a my hero academia reference 
---
I honestly don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve played against someone who has bad aim like that. Console is bit more difficult but cmon, we got aim assist lmao
---
Oh, sorry, I‚Äôll delete the post right now
---
I felt so bad after doing this but at the same time fulfilled
---
I never liked nova warp. Didn't do as much damage to pve enemies as I'd hoped and its useless when I do play pvp
---
That‚Äôs what word I was looking for trying to explain this to my buddies!
---
I'm sure we will see her, probably in a BA or JW style expansion. 
---
Done! going to my friend if i win so he can do the new stuff with me
---
Yeah wave splitter, even post nerf, is still absolutely ridiculous. I'm avoiding the crucible at all cost when it's released on PC. It was bad enough on PS4 üòÇ
---
I run 5-5-5
---
Yes, because the best way to answer a confirmation of PVP remaining a part of the franchise going forward is to immediately complain about PVP. You‚Äôre a master of communication skills.
---
and it‚Äôs a #HANDCANNON
---
i found out jumping works really well too
---
I don't wanna have to wait until D3 for them to make it so pulse rifles and MG's outrange sniper rifles and scouts.
---
Ikr üòÇüòÇ I‚Äôm just happy we got to show him up

You on Xbox?

Looks pretty sweet.
---
Done. üëçüèª

No, you still have to hit the head. I didn't think it was ever a one hit body shot. 
---
He never said this to me, only saod that he needs me with the red jack, even I go 10-0 in Rumble.
---
Unfortunately I do not have the editing means to do that, but if I *did* that would absolutely have happened
---
Have yet to do this raid, do you get to select any chest and keep your fingers crossed it has 1k?
---
its the only logical explanation, really.
---
It wasn't. Still very useful too. 
---
Yeah I totally agree. I always thought Exos were like robots or something but turns out it is a lot darker. 
---
Ended up with a we ran out of medals melee only 
---
Step 6: Convince Bungie to bring back the Cosmodrome for free roam.
---
Step 7: convince Bungie to have PvP in Destiny 3!!
---
Intrinsic: Every D1 vet cries about not having _____ exotic in D2 even though it was trash or impossible to nerf
---
Secondary Perk: Wolfpack rounds - these rounds do literally nothing, this was just to anger D1 vets into crying about Gjallarhorn
---
I mean you're lucky to get a weapon.
---
I finished Warden Of Nothing and got an exotic engram that gave me OTHERSIDE. Which I've already got three of those from steadfast engrams.
---
Ps. 90% of my exotic weapons are year 1 exotics.

What armor is that? And how do I get it!

I'd love to be risen in the dark ages

I'm pretty sure it's iron banner armour from warmind so you probably can't get it. 
---
*nerfs everything*
---
Gah damn it Loch Ness Monster Get the hell out of here!
---
Daily heroic mission is currently tangled shore, and the bosses have the exclusive body and helm drops, they always drop with a mod on so there an easy farm, plus lore pages can drop for the most loyal book
---
Quite pricey isnt she? Can only buy 10 before she ups her prices?
---
Done
---
mod components not armour/weapon mods. Anyways, you can always turn in simulation seeds for enhancement cores and get mod components at same time. 
---
F
---
Saw the Mythoclast eye and immediately had an Aneurysm.  
---
Trouble is i still need that armor. Its on my to do list. Lol. 
---
This is destiny 1 right?
---
Just wait till year 2.
---
Honestly. Destiyn 2 launch was an epic fail. Destiny 1 wasnt perfect either. Year 2 fixed and made both games a lot better. I honestly dint expect a change for destiny 3.
---
Over here using AoS like it‚Äôs TLW
---
Finally
---
My taste in gaming and music has come together
---
Bungie, who do I have to blow to get Tyler as a voice in D3?
---
Ok thanks a lot for the tip. Until june sound doable. I played some crucible and im already close to to my old performance. I currently use Ace of Spades and a Shotgun in crucible. It kind of works, even though (besides lunas) i do not really know the meta. Seems pulse rifles are strong again so I still would have my vigilance wing in that case. 
---
d1 y1 wasn't very smooth either
---
Yea but VOG 
---
I just remembered how much I chased the Necrochasm, only to be disappointed by the weapon... Beautiful, tho...
---
Are you still able to farm the blue grenade launchers for mods?
---
There are no exotic cloaks :(
---
Did it solo btw 
---
Time worn spire all day
---
YESS, its hard to get but goddamn is it powerful
---
Not with hands-on it isn't. Supers charge stupidly quick when getting multiple shoulder charge kills and you instantly get shoulder charge back.
---
Holy shit. I never got either, and here you are getting both at once! 
---
I don't think it does either. From what I've experienced the gear drops are randomized. 
---
we used to run VOG back to back 3 times every Tuesday. of course after doing the nightfall with each character. 
---
you're a fucking douche canoe. 
---
I thought this was a sparrow at first. Going back to bed now
---
That thing is a fookin' nightmare! Get it away!
---
icebreaker - almost forgot you old, trusty campingbuddy!
---
Is that... D2 Beta? Wow, that was a long time ago.
---
This is why you shouldn't have ether on you, you get caught for that shit real quick. Next time, consult spider and see if he would hold on to it for you.
---
&gt;	You‚Äôre correct. They are different. SSD is internal
---
SSD is a solid state drive, eg no spinning platter.  It can be either internal or external.

See, I was debating on putting it in, but it didn‚Äôt really go with the flow

I rolled a enhanced Sniper rifle targeting on my Knuckle head Radar. Sad part that's an exotic.
---
No problem ! Glad I could help 
---
This is too close to home. Hurt to watch
---
I run shards/BB, my boyfriend runs Orpheus/tether. I feel like we are doomed if we try to matchmake together and we either need to LFG or queue separately. Any advice?
---
SSDs are like an HDD, in the sense they both store data and connect to the console via USB.
---
However, Solid-State Drives have much faster read/write times, and therefore load game data faster than a Hard Disk Drive.
---
Hard Disk Drives have mechanical moving parts, and it needs to find the physical location of the data on its disks so the game can load.
---
On top of that, the physical disks are constantly spinning, so it might need multiple passes over the same location to get all the data it needs to the console.
---
Solid-State Drives read and write data at a speed of "however fast electricity moves" for the most part.
---
There are no moving parts, since it's basically a really high-capacity flash drive.
---
HOWEVER, both of these devices are limited by how much data can be shoved through a USB cable. USB 3 is much faster than USB 2, but it's still a very limiting factor.
---
HDDs might be able to reach that limit, but an SSD can and will reach that limit.
---
It's like the difference between trying to move the water from a small creek (data stream from an HDD) through a medium-sized riverbed (bandwidth of a USB 3 port), and trying to shove all the water going over Niagara Falls (data stream from an SSD) through that same riverbed.
---
Even with the limitations of a USB port, it is still possibly faster than whatever is inside of your console.
---
Remember, Sony/Microsoft want to get the cheapest parts possible so they can make the most profit (or least loss?) possible per console.
---
Cheaping out on an even-slower-than-usual HDD is an easy way to cut costs.
---
While an External HDD might be a small creek going through a small riverbed, the Internal HDD is like pissing through a straw.
---
I‚Äôm in the same bot and I‚Äôm not entirely sure why.  I need to dive in one of these days.
---
filthy!
---
To the best of my knowledge that ‚Äúslower‚Äù external port is USB 3.0, with up to 5Gbit/s.  The stock internal drive is a 5400rpm SATA II at 3Gbit/s.
---
The brave little toaster is also a fucking beast in gambit 
---
This makes me *angry as fuk*
---
my boy out here lookin like the tin man from Wizard of Oz
---
When doing my second bow frame last week i got jotunn, which i needed, but now that i have it, i woulda prefered to get monarque first, as bows are my expertise in this game, im just tired if using wishender, because as much as i love it, it sucks. The truesight isnt consistent, and le monarque does the exact same amount of damage, with a higher fire rate
---
#ITS HAMMER TIME
---
did the helmet stay on?
---
Ayy very well done! Love the way you did the fur.
---
Always
---
I sleeb till guardians are made 
---
Right? I can hit people in CS:GO with it.
---
Damn I wish the real ace had that amount of bloom when you fire fast lol
---
I don't even know what it is lol
---
Do you have wish-ender?
---
That is the rumor yea.   I can‚Äôt wait!
---
Yes we both got it
---
I mean, when you see your team looking around like they have a steering wheel controller to aim with... you kinda can hold it against them guilt free.
---
Well, we suffered through no radar season 3 comp to get Redrix Claymore. I find it only fair that you suffer, too.
---
Same! 
---
Nice 
---
Am I a piece of shit for enjoying myself with both?
---
midnight coup or any of the raid weapons don't drop from the catellum
---
I don't know what dubious volley is like except of course wardcliff coil. 
---
Ok..I suggest using hammerhead and maybe izagami burden for big damage..2 phase could be pretty easy with that combo
---
Yayyy I got it this week as well. And the ornament for it looks so cool! 
---
God damn it..
---
It‚Äôs like the gun from the Fifth Element 
---
Legit warlocks have 1 good super, hammers also will 1 hit anyone 
---
r/CompletelyExpectedTF2

Am I the only one who thinks hammers have been broken since TTK...
---
I feel like I read somewhere that it will; I don't think Bungie and Activision parted ways badly, so I don't see why they'd have to leave.

I'm not 100% sure on that actually, let me try that out to see if it helps. Thanks
---
Yep I know the feeling lol it happens to me sometimes not alot but when it does I'm just about ready to throw my controller across the room in a fit of rage.
---
You don't need to unlock it, just complete the campaign and aquire th quest for ace.

---
Spectral blades petrifies me
---
They cut the power down and lower the light level to try and make it more aligned.  It is mostly so the numbers do not go bat shit crazy, since we will end these dlc at 750 maybe even 800 depending on what they do with season of opulence. 
---
I also use a Logitech mouse. If that's the case, the solution would be simple. Bungie could validate it and look for common vectors among banned users. 
---
I would be willing to complete uninstall or even buy a new mice if that were the case, but the lack of communication doesn't allow me to fix anything if I had actually do something "wrong"
---
He's asking god roll, meaning the the best possible for that situation. Btw, none of those perks refund your bullets..
---
I know what it means, and I know it doesn't refund bullets, it feeds into the magazine meaning that you won't need to reload after winning a single MG duel. 
---
that sucks, I was there last week.  Keep up the fight man, you'll make it then Lunas and recluse will be yours.  Its all worth it
---
Upvoted
---
I‚Äôm a reaper so I must break their legs
---
Wait, how do you get exotics to drop?
---
Got the helm and the emblem!! 
---
Hmm, in gambit I'd say you're right. But in general pvp you'll want either tap the trigger/dynamic sway reduction.
---
Thanks for the kind words. I've been one win away twice now, so I know I'm capable of it I just gotta get the perfect storm of factors I feel like. 
---
The Bungie forums are filled with "Bungie is infallible.  If they banned you, there was a reason, cheater. Thank you for cleaning up the game, Bungie."  It's so backward there and it comes from people who barely play the game, and when they do play, it is on consoles.  
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I will say that I have never seen so many ban appeal posts in the years I've been on Bungie.net.
---
I had no idea what came over me when I was in that situation 
---
Except that‚Äôs the exact roll most PvP hunters wants on a knucklehead. Only time i take stompeez with traction off is to pop on a knucklehead for sniper action. 
---
You should do it now! The blocking would be pretty op
---
Or sunshot. 
---
I would be so damn upset if that ever happened to me
---
That line should be THE destiny slogan.
---
That's true but normal PvP is cancer.
---
K I got 100,000+ on 3/14 Nightfalls pretty easily and I've completed all raids and Chasm of Screams. If you don't think I can complete the other Nightfalls you're really pulling at straws.
---
ah, no, PC player I'm afraid. My name is a reference to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dizB1P5z_bk)
---
Other than they make scout rifles obsolete in Crucible. But then you nerf pulse range, then hand cannons make pulses obsolete. Then you nerf hand cannon range, and everyone gets mad because everyone loves the hand cannons so damn much lol. They made them feel *too* good to play with tbh.
---
Came in this thread expecting copypasta.
---
Wasn't disappointed.
---
Tks :)
---
Bungie creating something similar to gravity hammer for Destiny could be fun.
---
Ah I see you're also a man of culture üßê you know I have seriously considered using that speech
---
the last person is gonna be fucced by adds
---
Ah yeah, it's my go-to. I think drop-rate is pretty high; I got my first Jotunn the day it came out and have since got 2 more (and a 2nd Le Monarque) from doing the Powerful Frames in Bergusia. You'll get yours soon enough if you farm forges.
---
Pls....I want to die already.....  
---
  
---
To be resurrected again of course...
---
Just quit and rejoin after a minute. It's always faster
---
I won't deny that haha.
---
The last person is in the vault, where there is minimal ads lol
---
Are you legend in crucible? Have you gotten the flawless raids? Do you have all the pinnacle weapons? Have you found God rolls to all the black Armory weapons? Gotten all sets of gambit prime notorious armor? God rolls of all gambit prime weapons? God rolls of all LW and SotP weapons and armor? Oh doing all that doesnt appeal to you? Then you dont enjoy the content.
---
They don‚Äôt outrange scouts and snipers, just 99% of Crucible/Gambit maps don‚Äôt have range beyond pulse range, so anything longer-range than a pulse is clunky.
---
Listen here you little shit
---
I always leave a match in which we mercy a team and get match made into a match in progress where the opposite is happening.
---
How long must I ride this teeter-totter of destruction?!
---
Ophidian Aspect and Blink. I have lived through some dumb stuff just because I blinked straight up or around a corner. Warlocks don't handle the same way in PVP as the other classes, but they all have a special play style to them in my experience.
---
Haha First games of the day can be rough. 
---
I load into my first match yesterday and immediately get messaged about my loadout and I swear the guy who messaged was hunting me after that. It's like, "chill bro I just woke up!"
---
(Loadout was recluse and a hand cannon, I guess that's sweaty?)
---
Smoldering pile. Best comment ever.
---
You taught him the value of evasive maneuvers. Keep being you, brother. Apes, together, strong.
---
*tries.
---
What comes on the curated roll?
---
Definitely takes me a game or two to warm up my aim and who gets toxic in QP?
---
 ? the exotic is utter garbage and the main perk has a fucking cooldown. I specifically said one that makes swords more viable not "an exotic that changes basically nothing" 
---
Yes. And it is amazing
---
Damn
---
Crotas end wasnt bad, how many times people did it would dismiss that thought.  Sure it was short, solo'able, yes absolutely...its what made it fun.
---
Id argue last wish being up there but then again, i enjoyed CE, you didnt.  I never said D2 raids were bad.  They just seem as though they were overthought a bit.  On top of that, the rewards for completion with d2 raids is utter shit compared to old raids.  Again, simply my opinion, and obviously, it differs from yours.  In the end thats ok too.
---
Or you can fast travel to any destination.
---
K
---
Fucking finally.

Idk why they downvoted you, that‚Äôs a funny r/subsIfellfor

My 2nd 2080ti has died and all I want to do is play D2! EVGA is slacking on shipping my replacement!!!!

many thanks, comrade

You sound a little.... Crabby..... just kidding :)
---
Very cool!
---
I also miss Mr. funny robot  :C
---
;)
---
I demand a Colonel ghost shell
---
What about dynamic sway reduction? And what if it tightened the spread to a ball of bullets?
---
That‚Äôs brutal I tried with my brother and we tapped out at 35 minutes.  Congrats 
---
Thanks for your suggestions! and yes I definitely think having the SIVA crisis in the campaign would be a lot of fun but I haven't figured how I'll be including it yet. 
---
Also thanks for bringing up the speaker I completely forgot about him lol he was kind of important during that time
---
This seems ambiguous. Could mean a couple different things.
---
Dont you just love artificial difficulty?
---
It's a bungie classic.

I was confused as to how everyone died by punchy, because I have not seen that skin for synthocepts.

Dude. Gambit is part pvp. I‚Äôm talking when the invader uses chaos reach its OP. You‚Äôre stupid. I was talking about pvp. I was mentioning it‚Äôs pvp aspect. All warlock supers are team wiping supers

Agreed. Enjoy the grind and then use that for your next character.

FUCK YEAH I CAN BE A GUARDIAN

New Polaris Lance ornament looks sick!

I heard he looks like a buff Phillip Seymour Hoffman...

Yeah, I honestly don‚Äôt think you can get it any other way. If he received it without the powerful drop, that may require research ü§î

If you wait until near max light to complete exotic quests they'll come out as powerful meaning a little higher than your light maximum light. Also, the game counts your maximum light for powerful gear by checking your average of the highest in every slot even if it's not equipped. This means that you can use lower light weapons you enjoy and still progress as long as you keep you highest light of that slot in your inventory.

Phrasing

Ah, another well-cultured guardian. This pleases me so.

Dont use the lvl 30 thing on your first character, itll kinda ruin the experience. (Feel free to on your 2nd and 3rd) and the first thing you'll need to access alot of the content is a high enough light level so Id focus on that first
