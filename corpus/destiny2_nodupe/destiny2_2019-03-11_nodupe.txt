That’s why I run a ghost that speeds up summons
---
---
---
Really? Those are a thing?!?!
---

---
I NEED IT! 
---
Not long at all, part of the new update are bounties that will get you within level to play new endgame content 
---
Lunafactions on a Radiance lock are kinda silly. 100% rift uptime if you've got a friend, means never having to reload any of your guns.
---
It’s actually added before then too. I’ve only done 4 strikes and a Nightfall, and I have a 658 Service Revolver
---
I agree. Visiting the sub made me realize how bad things had gotten, which would have taken me longer to realize had I not read anything there. I started anthem during the content draught before season of the drifter but now I don't really have a reason to play anthem atm. I'd rather play comp or farm weapons in reckoning. 
---
Ol' yawllerhorn??
---
Saying Gambit Prime is a bad gamemode because the people who play it are bad is incorrect, that's just a fact. An opinion would be "I don't think Gambit Prime is fun because I never get paired with a good team" is an opinion that is neither correct nor incorrect. I so get what you mean too but the player base has nothing to do with the quality of the mode itself. 
---
Under: Crucible —&gt; Lifetime —&gt; Glory ranks
---
Yes, there is a random roll perk for ghosts called speed demons. It decreases sparrow summon time and reloads weapons while you ride you sparrow 
---
Not too long of a grind. There are bounties now to increase you to 640 rather quickly. You would just have to reach level 50, and you can do that by simply playing through all of forsaken. 700 is max light right now just raises from 650 last tuesday.
---
Depends this seems pve oriented. Alot of your c class give incredible neutral game.
---
It has to be a FULL set of Gambit armor. If that didn’t do it, then the quest is bugged
---
This. I tried my ass off last season and only got to heroic 1. 
---
Love the post apocalyptic drifter look 
---
That’s supposed to be your character. I’m pretty sure we’ll see them with the thorn quest
---
about as dumb as exploit abusers. 
---
Yeah hes pretty bad sometimes especially when your about to melt with your super and he tethers you
---
Actually had more dupe exotics last week than before. 
---
I'm not familiar with that feel in Crucible. I did get hate mail in Sparrow Racing once though, that was uplifting!
---
It's usually referenced in the quest step, but yeah I suppose we'll see.
---
That requires a 666 Better Devils and one's firstborn to be sacrificed.
---
situationally useful in pvp though since you can hold a perfect shot and wait for someone to peek/round corners 
---
It should be a re-creation of the original Thorn quest. That wizard was a bitch.
---
I got to heroic 1 last season in the day of the reset. Couldn't make much progress since the teams I met had at least 2 people with Luna's or not forgotten.
---
Cayde knew the ship would have took forever to load him into the next part of the level.
---
What dlc do you have? 
---
That arms not white enough for the backdrop of those emblems. I need to blinded to truly enjoy those tats.
---
I took me about 30 tries on ps4. I wanted to cry I was so mad
---
Shit
---
IT's great with Breakneck too. Really keeps the buff uptimes.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Curse of Osiris = bad
---
Forsaken = good
---
Can you go on top of the big bridge in the dreaming city 
---
Nah it’s only added if you unlocked it during a previous season (I think it was warmind, not 100% though)
---
Mk.44 is better for Code of the Missile and Synthos are damn good and their melee buff stacks with other melee buffs. Try comboing it with top tree Sentinel. The damage and melee range is ridiculous. It's like you're playing Iron Banner against a bunch of 600 LL.
---
They're incompetent, content doesn't take thousands of lines of code and textures to make, and bugs are easy as hell to fix!
---
/s obviously.
---
You’ll get nothing at all
---
So how is it? I'm working towards getting mine but I can only stand strikes for so long lol
---
P.S. I hope you realize the downvotes aren't coming from sexists, but from people who think you sound sexist. That last statement of yours especially sounds like you're saying men are the only ones strong enough to stand up to other men. This kind of thinking is just as bad as the kind of people you're denouncing. I can believe that your intentions are good, but you are very misguided. I want to try to help you understand.  
---
Please, do not put women on a pedestal as things to be defended and coddled. Just treat us like normal, adult human beings. Let us fight our own battles (We can! Trust me!) and learn our own lessons. The people that make me feel most uncomfortable and singled out in games are not the trash-talkers, but the ones that give me special treatment and try to make the game easier for me just because I'm a girl. The same idea carries over to life. It's great to have someone's back but don't go too far to the point that it's annoying and feels insulting, and don't do it because they're a woman, but because they're a friend. 
---
So i play on a crappy pc. Is this what the actual graphics look like?
---
Wow.... nice
---
I like it! But in my opinion all hunters look better than any titan or warlock. :) 
---
And what’s funny to me, is that this season has been easier for me. I finished getting my Not Forgotten, where as last season it was a struggle for me so I didn’t pursue it. I feel like the beginning of the seasons are easier than when the season is further down the road. Everyone is focused on the reckoning and gambit prime, which frees up competitive scene of a lot of the sweaty players.
---
Personally I’m not a huge fan. I don’t feel like it’s very powerful 
---
Updating my bios, stopped my random freezes.  
---
Early in my trouble shooting I thought it was GPU related because if I reinstalled my GPU driver it seemed to not freeze right away but it always did in the end.
---
I also turned off my overclock on my CPU, I was just using the ASUS AI suite software anyway to do it.  No real reason to overclock if your stuff is new.
---
All that said what is your PC build
---
CPU
---
Mobo w/Bios version
---
GPU
---
Just got queenbreaker
---
and was sad it wasn’t ceberus +1
---
Bad news for ya
---
Bungies way of loading a bunch of stuff for u so that when a new exotic comes out u won’t get it for the next 3 months 
---
You have to blur out people's names.
---
This is witch-hunting.
---
If you repost it, you'll be permanently banned. 
---
Parkour!
---
whats the third shader thats black and gray ?
---
Just be like me. Run through ALL the content as fast as humanly possible, stop playing for two weeks come back and then play casually for a month or 3. I love playing that way 
---
still on first step lol
---
Okay then, nevermind. I did not want to start a witch hunt or somethingjme that 
---
wait fr?
---
PC EU here
---
Bet it’s still not an exotic you don’t have 
---
Those are not mutually exclusive. 
---
Can definitely be on the new scout
---
Source: me 
---
To everyone asking how, my guess is that I was in a fire team with a low level friend who was still doing red war, with that in kind cayde was still alive.
---
Because you want it handed to you. 
---
Gotta love Destinythegame.
---
I dismantled for the shader, I wish it they have curated rolls they’d have both good perks, for a sub machine gun that fast firing only getting 5 shots on a slide is eh :/
---
[but wait, there's more](https://i.imgur.com/aBhorbQ.jpg)
---
Well I started D2 on my PS4 until it bricked. Had it since launch and played the shit out of it until Black Armory dropped and I got burnt out. Picked up a Xbox One S Black Friday last year since my PS4 bricked and bought the collection shortly after Xmas. Been playing it since. So yeah I’m pretty behind compared to what I was doing on the PS4. So yes, I’m still getting new gear. Lol
---
Sucks to not be getting anything new though. Dry periods in the game is always awful.
---
They should make it how it was in D1 where whoever was nearby could get it.
---
It’s called Shrouded Stripes. It was introduced in Season 5
---
Ironically, hunters have the best crucible supers
---
The way he looked back at the ammo spawn, and then jumped was brilliant.
---
You need to own both Forsaken and the annual pass. [This page has a chart showing what activities](https://www.bungie.net/en-us/Explore/Detail/News/47648) require just the base game, Forsaken, or Forsaken + annual pass. 
---
Yeah I really don’t understand why the game hates me. I think it’s just that I play too much  and the game is telling me to get a life but idk
---
1,2,3,4 cool seasonal armour.
---
   
---
5,6,7,8...  Same old S4 trash. The hunter helmet and titan legs are misery. With jokers wild giving us a chance of some real story writing for zavala and actual character development....I have a foreboding feeling that zavala's writing will not improve if he even gets any writing at all.
---
I felt terrible but I also couldn’t stop laughing haha
---
Last Word quest made me like PVP :O
---
They are also in bergusia 
---
Yup
---
Its a shame its the hideous suros mg.
---
annnnnnnnnnnnd it’s bugged
---
Yeah, it feels really weak, even when doing critical hits, most weak mobs don't get killed with a single hit.
---
&gt;Updating my bios, stopped my random freezes.  
---
Very very interesting. Hmm.
---
&gt;All that said what is your PC build
---
My PC is an SFF build in an NCase N1, consisting of:
---
- 8700k on liquid
---
- EVGA GTX 1080 Ti SC2 Hybrid
---
- Asrock Fatal1ty Z370 Gaming/ITX
---
Bios version currently is 1.70
---
Satans Orpheus Rig
---
Fuck you got us
---
I can stand up to any enemy with a firm grip on my controller and a smirk on my face. But when an ogre lumbers into a fight, I feel a shiver in my fingers and have a slight panic attack while I reconsider all my options for the rest of the fight. 
---
They won’t fix it for comp they won’t fix it for gambit.
---
Never say no to the panda...
---
Forgot to mention, this is towards 'Making an impact' Quest Step when you want the set and possibly dismantled beforehand not being able to reaccquire (randomized gear).
---
In fact it does, the power level increase is for everyone who at least has forsaken.. The guy who answered you  doesn't know what is talking about. Proof: the calendar of the upcoming releases
---
I think you meant to replace the top one with s sparrow.
---
I've noticed players doing some weird stuff since the update. We've been one mote off and people just don't bank.
---
That's a poncho
---
It does seem a bit easier after the new season
---
Some community teams are just better at handling cynicism and burnout. Being 500 Hr into D2 the cynicism is building for me too. Every update they hype up, they over hype their product and then disappoint people.
---
Ok thanks I guess I’m just in for a slow long grind lol 
---
Lord Saladin?
---
I think it was literally just for the reveal of him in that trailer. There's no justifiable reason why he'd need to be wearing a poncho lol.
---
At least it improves your 1v1 and 1v4 lol bow last word is a good rumble set up for me
---
Just like The Last Word...
---
exactly this. quickplay championship in a nutshell. i just use whatever i want, scouts, snipers, fusions, anything make me feel rewarding when killing someone. 
---
I'm sad d1 never be on PC.
---
I would guess kinetic, in the same fashion as Last Word
---
Same. Well at least I play d2 on PC.
---
I was using mountaintop in comp and my friend pushed me into a corner when I shot, I died instantly 
---
*Minecraft xp noises*
---
I call bullshit.
---
No way your team killed their Envoys like they were supposed to.
---
Oem and the mask were both new to me. I was just very happily surprised by those two
---
Thank you for the information! 
---
Since the beginning of destiny there has been PS exclusives. Always locked behind a 1 year release. A deal don’t made with Bungie no doubt. Probably means there giving them x amount of money or something to have the exclusive to try and drag a few people over. Nothing wrong with that. Bungie no doubt accepted because that extra income gives them the ability to keep improving the game. 
---
I think it just got a buff too. So that’s a plus.
---
Yeah im not a seasoned SMG user. I used a heros burden for fun every now and then but I wasnt good with it but Master of Arms makes this weapon god-tier and it helps me in a lot of rumble games when multiple people are rushing me with a shotty.
---
i just hope its not a let down like Malfeasance is
---
The grind, the lore, the adventure, the teamwork, the loot, the one of a kind first of its kind kinda game.
---
Because whats better than kill clip? Multi Kill Clip!!
---
Love watching 2 of the warlocks on my team go full chaos reach before any envoys are dead.
---
Oh, I’ve been on that forum for 10+ years, it is PURE salt.
---
Lmao truth. Same here.
---
Ok I was mistaken dont need to insult me but the fact is that the power increase is for players that are jumping into the new content with the annual pass. This has been stated in the vidoc and in this week at bungie. The last time I look at the year two roapmap was whenever it was first released.
---
I think that's exactly his point
---
 "why are you showing us this?" Isnt criticism, it just being a blatant ass.
---
And as you may see from a lot of the comments in the post, it *is* difficult for some and they would see it as an accomplishment. Theres no need to shit on someone elses achievements just because it was easier for you to do it, and that's exactly what his intent was.
---
I’ve always used either the Thunderlord or the Hammerhead for invading; tried rocket launchers and the Sleeper but people just hid. LMGs make it more fun anyway.
---
Liters since all blood I'll be spilling in pvp and gambit, maybe gallons 
---
I remember DDOSing very clearly too.
---
"Mistakes"
---
Isn’t this a toxic post by nature tho?
---
I finished the crucible step in one match, because I queued into a Rumble match where everyone else was afk.
---
have u tried pairing it with mountaintop? just insane.
---
The desert sand could probably wreak havoc on the joints and any gaps.
---
"mistakes" 
---
Yes
---
I dont have mountaintop, im not that good with fighting lion and i dont have a militias birthright. But someone paired it with mountain in rumble and I got curb stomped everytime I saw him
---
Yes, those totally accidental things....
---
.... That happen when you purposefully turn firepower on your allies for a laugh
---
Even gambit prime? (Been playing that mainly)
---
Reaching fabled in comp requires being good, right? Im not great at pvp but i want the recluse sooooo bad! 
---
We are looking at you whisper
---
You can definitely get it on rank ups and gambit bounties, but I don’t think it’s a random drop
---
I think it's probably because the sand is blowing around, and can work it's way into the gaps of the armor.
---
No thanks! 
---
Too true.
---
“I need NF so I can shit on people as a 6 stack in Quickplay so I feel better about myself”
---
Yea I was thinking of getting another fan but I don’t want that 
---
Oh man that's the shiet right there.
---
Checking ligh.gg and its on there so not to worry
---
Need this as a ring tone
---
Not good. 
---
It won't. The datamined quest steps (spoilers I guess) shows it will have crucible steps, but they can be alternately done through public events and night fall. It does say though that one quest has hand cannon crucible kills and void kills as a step so be prepared
---
*Laughs in Blade Barrage*
---
ding
---
There haven't been any messages in that time period for me either. I'm assuming we won't see another until Tuesday when the Allegiance questline kicks off for real.
---
It's technically recreating the thorn from the leaked steps. You find a melted thorn and go through re making it and making it a weapon of sorrow again
---
Aw sorry to hear that
---
Isn't this how every class comparison/argument works though?
---
"Class A is better than B and C because of X"
---
"Ok but class B has Y and class A doesn't"
---
"But we know class C is the best because we have Z and neither of you do"
---
If it’s not fixed with the fan would you assume it’s because of lack of airflow? At home I would play in an open space 
---
Poncho McPuncho
---
Your wish is granted, mostly because I want to dr strange in destiny.
---
I love it too the comments they send are so funny a few days ago this kid threatened to report me for hacking after going on a rampage with my Sunshot and chattering bone on my Titan (hunter main btw) I take it as a compliment because it means I’m improving 
---
Laughs in shards of galanor
---
GP is kinda dull, I mean the armor perks aren't going to really matter at the end (because the rich/try hards will get richer) and just mean for faster games and nobody will try. On the other hand, if the weapon perks worked with Reckoning, I could see them actually being helpful (considering the resistance arc/solar/void)
---
Yeah you have to be pretty good, I’d recommend a team too
---
FINALLY JESUS lol did some else finally see the shit I've been saying sense forsaken??
---
Did you make this ? ?
---
"Seriously, Never Again"
---
If we are not getting some points at least fix the emblem counter pls :(
---
Exactly! Though I also kinda want the option to lower the hood on Hunters' capes.
---
I would have been rage typing through the post-match screens. Super passive-aggressive.
---
Patrols worked for me. And pay attention to the map to see when PE are starting. Don't get sucked into EP, unless you're getting kills for a patrol.
---
I hate you. +1
---
Titans have an exotic that helps get super back quicker,
---
They’re called #Synthoceps
---
When i finally came back i got a bunch of forsaken exotics
---
Lol, too true 
---
Playing Gambit Prime, I realize how much I took army of one medals for granted...
---
Now you gotta do it over a cover of Deja Vu.
---
I asked about tips for Reckoning on a post earlier this week. Someone told me this and now I feel like a god on the battlefield.
---
It's a current bug not just you, I grinded like 10 hours of gambit and it says 0 percent 
---

---
Follow this guide.
---
Dude back in Y1 Destiny 2, when I was playing a lot, I literally only got Skullfort and Synthoceps and would swap them out depending on what I was doing. I don’t think I fired a full magazine during that time. I was just punchin fools. Or kneeing then which was always my favorite. 
---
I feel like if the warlock class item was their jacket/robe that’d be cool. 
---
Bullshit
---
Chief just wanted to look dope af
---
[removed]
---
Uh halo existed first.... 
---
Sadly, you can't reroll masterworks on Year 2 weapons like you can on year 1 weapons.  That's a feature I really want to return.  
---
By the way, are you new to Destiny? It's pretty obvious. lol
---
Same! Prime takes too long and I feel helpless as a solo mid level player trying to keep a failing team together.
---
Shit this just happened I'm *panicking* *immensely*
---
Just doing the weekly challenges and strikes for me.  
---
We need poncho cloaks for hunters. Titans have all the good cosmetics 
---
YES YES YES, **FUCK** 
---
Awesome! Congrats on your clear. Reckoning is fun.
---
Check out destiny lfg discord. Been having a lot of good luck On Reckoning groups.
---
It’s a beautiful time to be alive 
---
I got it too and love it
---
Ah I thought it was set on 670 but I might be wrong tho
---
Ty m8
---
Oh yeah not a complaint. Just curious if anyone is interested in going for it as a collection. I was but then I got a little overwhelmed when I realized the size of the task at hand.
---
What was giving the best drops for you? Raid loot or were you lucky with prime engrams? 
---
Wait, What about the Nine? The practically let Skolas loose in house of wolves... Doesn't sound like a good guy thing to do to me. 
---
No capes are better Hawthorne

Destiny lfg discord. Done it about 8/12 today.

This! Can someone pls edit it?

I was waiting for you to notice

Where can I search for a good clan? sorry if I missed that on the FAQs above. I'm sick of flakes and assholes. I play mostly at night time/into early morning eastern time US. Looking for a clan that is active and is good people. Im a decent player, play 20+ hours a week. Need help with crucible skills the most. 
---
Lol! 
---
D I N G 
---
I dont hate the grind that much, if you have all the time you want for it and not only one Season. But i dont like it when you have to be part of a group... Because i dont have friends playing D2. 
---
There's no coming back from this now lol
---
Pc or console?
---
the completed matches don’t go up
---
terrific.... terrific....

#I'M A TITAN
---
Thanks for the info!
---
I'm afraid i dont have the mod, will take a look at the video later
---
  A titan with a cloak would look awesome. If bungie added that feature, I would go as a titan main!
---
No. It was like that all along.
---
Pc
---
There’s 8 cats located around the Dreaming Coty, giving them the gift will obviously gift you with something :)
---
Thanks! After my first char I was 662 then after doing 2nd I got to 671 and now on my last one Im at 685 idk I think I got lucky 
---
He was unlocking the forges, which forces you to complete a specific frame. So its kinda OPs fault for not unlocking these earlier ;s
---
I main a Titan, and I would like to morph into Poncho Chief
---
Can i go to ant of the 8 cats? (If do why did they make 8?!) 
---
Can they give weapons or armor? 
---
Read that in his voice too!
---
You can scrap the frame and get a different one tho
---
I really want to like this sparrow but it just looks too much like the vanilla sparrow frame with some added shit slapped on. 
---
A bit lackluster imo. Shader is dope though.
---
The God of Wealth
---
I demand warlocks have the ability to float in air like the Emissary.
---
Yeah, but once you use a gift on one car you can’t use that cat again, and both weapons and armour plus some material thing, the name which eludes me xD
---
Ding
---
Me being forced to play crucible for quests.
---
If you Google Destiny 2 roadmap, all you questions will be answered.
---
It really does. Lion rampants are the only exotic in the game that allows you to access a prestige eater of worlds chest on titans without having to kill anything in the raid
---
God damn. This is the content I subscribe for. 
---
Rip, might have to try it on another character 
---
I restored last update and it worked 😭 thank god
---
I am going to say it again. ANOTHER reason why I am siding with the drifter.

https://discordapp.com/invite/d2pclfg

I laughed way to hard at this
---
Monochromatic all day
---
Shoulder charge is easy to counter it's OEM that STILL ridiculous and that's coming from a Titan main
---
I have 5 super mods, and based on what content I play, I use certain armaments. If I do the last wish raid, I have my gloves with taken armaments, if I play SOTP, I have the fallen one. So I play towards environment too, so I can have abilities recharge quicker, as well as get that heavy I need in the fight

Nice Pancho Chief

Not anymore

You can’t meme the goat 
---
Seriously, Never
---
When its solar singe and you see 3 hunters with nighthawk and bottom tree GG
---
I was thinking the same too. My bro plays Titan so we’ll have to give it a go later
---
That is just a raid boss at that point. A strike boss would last so little you'd think it was a redbar
---
Saints Row intensifies
---
i mean the "Taken Anomaly on IO" for an example.... seems to be the start of a series of quests? or so i heard...
---
We weren't even testing for that.
---
Qp pvp: slog of being pubstomped by homeless trials junkies.
---
 Pvevp: slog of invasions and artificially extended match times through mote-drain, boss healing/immunities. 
---
Comp pvp: untouchable, punishing nightmare hellscape of the opposite of fun
---
New pve: timed challenges, easy to fail, no tutorial or explanation or waypoints, have to Google to understand. 
---
There's plenty of "content" but the only stuff that gets you powerful gear is pretty punishing rn. Last story missions and adventures we got were in September. Increasing overall difficulty =/= more fun. Still a weekly, almost daily player, but the last time I had fun on d2 was Warmind and parts of Forsaken I guess. 
---
Can you post a screenshot of your Triumph page and a screenshot of your EDZ map? Just figure it's worth getting another set of eyes on it in case your missing one when you look at it?
---
no i meant the "Taken Anomaly" one... =)
---
Yeah I only use my Hazard because it has Ambitious Assassin and rampage w/ rampage mod.  
---
I will do in 30 min for you ;) also the sites i am on about so you can see how weird it is. I really think its a bug XD
---
Sometimes when we run as a stack we try Wardcliff but it throws everyone’s loadouts off. Malt does decent enough damage to burn?
---
that's a lie brah
---
Glass? 
---
The new invader emblem does track Army of One medals :) 
---
That did not age well...
---
I want this as a ringtone where is it posted? 
---
This was me to dawn blade last night... smh
---
Yeah if I’m not running Well/Luna I run Nova/Skull. It’s nuts for envoy phase 
---
if you use BB in mayhem you're being a bigger Uldren than a hunter running tether
---
Dude got a 670 cold heart drop, fucker hit those knights in t2 like a freight train, and it kept rubbing then over until they died died
---
Look for the comment that says 'source'
---
Wrong.  It was scorn again.
---
A modifier that halves your health and shields, but doubles your Regen. You die super fast.
---
Suck my tether!
---
You have to get Luna's first.
---
Yeah but still possible
---
I have exactly zilch desire for another stupid exotic hand cannon quest. 
---
Could be a bug - try to do this with another character. 
---
only with certain rolls, first day was fine with uber power weapons, day 2 if vex showed up you just died.  Void singe and glass shields, with vex snipers you just die.  I want to do T2 but I have to find a new guild to do so, only 657 after all my things are done and don't want to random that nonsense.

Made a post about a bounty typo that might confuse some players, and immediately got downvoted and responses like, "Well, you should have not taken the vernacular literally", and "Well I automatically assumed it was what it was intended in the first place."
---
I would hate to be any kind of person with authority here, or even devs that read stuff like that all the time. People wonder why this place is looking for mods.
---
Gimme a full version
---
Drifter has lately been seen hiding down in the Annex, apparently terrified out of his mind...
---
Yeah it definitely can be great, I just need to make myself change my load out to try it. I do t think it really felt natural to me.
---
During the match or when the match ended ?
---
Outcast of the IX 2 \[IX 2\] is an aussie heavy clan, don't be active on the discord tho, the mod is an anti-swearsies sort of guy
---
I believe that Iron banner boost wins for the triumph but it won't be counted towards glory rank
---
Not enough!
---
Me and my buddy finished a quickolay match and i saw that it dropped as the countdown was going
---
As it ended
---
Bungie should make a Ghost shell in the shape of a woman, and have it not accept blue shaders.
---
Bro, dont look at the exotic bonds/cloaks/marks
---
They hit you hard man ;(
---
Same here, but I got stronghold instead
---
I don't know what people are complaining about tbh. I started after Forsaken and every Exotic I got was not a dupe except for certain ones that drop in specific locations like Le Monarque.
---
I almost have every Exotic now, only missing Quest and Raid Exotics and maybe 1-2 Armor Pieces for each Class.
---
I know one of the objectives is to complete 2 crucible games. You might have finished it and given that. It looks like nice skin. My bug out needs it. 
---
That's my guess as well
---
IMO they should try to get rid off it, people quiting not because connection but when they see 3 or 4 stack against them. Without loss streak whole playlist may be healthier as way more players will be trying to get pinnacle weapons. A lot of my friends stop playing comp because they lost 400 or 500 points in a day
---
God I hope Bungie uses this for the teaser video about Sparrow Racing coming back 
---
I did. But why cant I do more frames then? There is only one available of the 3 that should be available?
---
Well, he is the “drifter”
---
You have to do specific frames to unlock specific forges. Once you’ve got that forge unlocked you can do the weapons associated with it but not the others. Once all 4 are unlocked you will be able to Forge all the frames, but you can still only do one powerful frame at a time. 
---
Exotic Quest was already revealed/leaked.
---
Looks pretty tame. You'll be fine.
---
Weapon ornament for the recluse. Comp pinnacle weapon this season.
---
666 PL Exotic Engram
---
Opens: Mask of the Sixth Man
---
You: ...
---
Read this string after I commented but I did hear one of my clan mates talking about a bug with the frames and forges right now. I haven’t done forges since the new season started so I can comment on what the bug is or if it’s legit. 
---
Aiming with Queenbreaker is not part of my Damage Rotation!
---
That the ornament for "The recluse", the new crucible pinnacle weapon. That a random drop at the end of PvP game.
---
Your a vex
---
Seems like everyone wanted more grinding stuff, right up until they actually got more grinding lol.
---
Same. I switch onto golden gun until I use it and get killed while doing the animation of the gun... get angry... and switch back to blades
---
A phat chaos reach beam with geo-mags and a 1k will do the trick
---
My fav part is when they trade kills, so much dps everywhere my screen lights up like the intro lol. 
---
MOVE THE CURSOR!
---
Thank you for saying this. Agree 100%
---
Takes the dragon’s breath right out of me 
---
Crooked Fang 4fr with backup plan and opening shot with a Charge MW is fucking insane. ive been using one and it one shots with a headshot, and fires so fast it can outkill an invader using anything but Rockets or a super. AND it does good damage to Yellow bars.
---
no need for macros you can do it on console
---
This is cursed. Delete this.
---
Ironically nova is just as popular if not more so than Bb.
---
What do you need for wayfarer?
---
I know... A company formed to make money... just absurd.
---
Or just fix the god dang spawn system.
---
Doing those will get you to light level 640 too
---
I'd rather see some other supers that underperform or have either a weak super/ neutral game be buffed rather then nerf a super which isn't doing anything insane like nova warp could at one point (R.I.P nova warp I miss you 😢). Top and bottom tree stormcaller could really use some kind of buff imo for both pvp and pve. Sentinel could also do with a small damage buff in pve too. I don't know if that's just me though.
---
Bawling* sorry lol, probably my biggest spelling pet peeve in existence.
---
Man, if only Bungie out out some kind of notice about stuff like this... Some kind of weekly blog post or something... Maybe it'd be on their site... 
---
The Season of the Forge armor is a good compromise, imo. The warlock raid armor in particularly is bulky and "muscular" like titan armor, and the forge helmet works pretty well. It's what I run the majority of the time.
---
It's not effortless for everyone, you do know that right? That should be pretty obvious with how much people were complaining about TLW quest steps when it was released, and the people who have commented **ON THIS POST** that it is absolutely not "effortless" for everyone. Not everyone who plays this game has the same skill level, or the same amount of free time as other people. Believe it or not, there are people on this planet other than you, and some of them find things difficult and feel good about themselves when they finally get past and then they would like to share that with others. Isnt that what reddit is? And what a majority of this sub is? If all you're going to do is try to make other people feel shitty for their accomplishments just because you dont feel like it was difficult for you, then you can go fuck right off.
---
Commentors like you are just as bad, if not worse than shitposters.
---
You realize thats because we were already doing shady ass shit and use guns that kill guardians right?
---
Yeah that’s not a thing anymore :/
---
My friend has had a glitched Oracle Offering since the very first “2nd” Week. It’s infinite and he just runs on over to the machine and can put it in infinite times. He got Queenbreaker the same way
---
I still destroy people with it in Mayhem. Didn't even know there was a Nerf or a buff. 
---
This further intensified the lack of eyelashes 
---
Ye shouldve just checked found the answer straight away. Sorry for taking your time :(
---
first of all, the last time my Guardian touched a weapon of sorrow or anything of the sort was the Touch of Malice
---
I used it on a forge boss, and the results were more than a little disappointing. Do you need a well to make it work or what?
---
Ya really never used crimson?
---
I got the Bare Bones one recently. It looks so stupid, I just use it all the time now.
---
That looks absolutely incredible 
---
I just get Barraged to the face and die when I do it. 
---
Oh no!
---
Did the recommended light level get increased for strikes when Forsaken came out? 
---
I was looking for this 
---
not on my Titan no, and I'm a Titan main
---
And they say Titans are the problem. 
---
I think i was in that game. On the other team, though.
---
Pshhh talking about gg.
---
Everyone knows the real side track is arc.
---
Like really who the heck ever uses that thing its so bad. *looks around*
---
But the main issue with spectral is how to nerf it. Nerfing its dr is gonna harm is more so and make it into arc 2.0 where people only use it for the tree skills. Its duration and its just gonna drive people into using gwin and more cheese strats. The best i say is to make gwin from giving super energy back to giving it an range attack. Like throwing one of the blades that does one gg bullet damage.
---
Also nerf titans plez.
---
Did the recommended light level increase for the current strikes when Forsaken came out? 
---
Well regardless i think its assumed lore
---
That rocket launcher was so fun
---
Gwisin needs to be nerfed. 
---
Shaved drifter
---
Personally im not too sad for nova warp.  But I also believe supers should be powerful and game changing. If we end up nerfing them a lot they might end up becoming just buffed special weapons. Thats just my opinion tho
---
Meanwhile, warlocks are left with ZERO good supers for PvP.
---
I still have 1 of his treasure markers on my map that I refuse to go and pick up :'(
---
Always on the other team. =(
---
I wish Gambit had anywhere near that number of players to work with. A tenth of that would probably work for all sorts of matchmaking rules.
---
777...9311?  
---
[https://youtu.be/zioEaqjPAGI](https://youtu.be/zioEaqjPAGI)
---
The first kill had me like what in the hell
---
Sunshot sparrow
---
This is a drifter I can trust. He reminds me of my dad
---
You don’t have this, right? I don’t see it in the bright engram list 
---
*pukes*
---
ok so the first DLC Curse of Osiris tells the story of the namesake character, his ghost Saghira, Brother Vance, and Ikora
---
exotic drops are the following 
---
for Weapons: Crimson, Jade Rabbit, Prometheus Lens, Telesto, The Colony
---
for armor starting with Titan, then Hunter, then Warlock:
---
Khepri's Horn, Helm of Saint-14, Aeon Safe, MK. 44 Stand Asides
---
Graviton Forfeit, Aeon Swift, Shinobu's Vow, Gemini Jester
---
The Stag, Aeon Soul, Ophidian Aspect, Vesper of Radius
---
r/foundthemobileuser
---
You gotta surprise them and try to end up in their spawn dropping electric fields if they all play blade barrage. 
---
My titan is going to be a good guy, but my warlock and hunter . . . Not sure who will be which 
---
u/vreddit_bot
---
Another awesome piece. So awesome to see someone so talented making stuff for a game I love 
---
Lol!
---
Well, still had it happen.
---
Play Rumble.
---
Yes, that's what i meant! I though maybe my issue was that i don't ever wear the Reverie Dawn armor in the dreaming city but idk
---
I didn't know how much I wanted a RvB style series of Destiny until right now.
---
It doesn’t work. Someone already tried. I’m pretty sure the cart limit is $5,000. 
---
Worst is killed twice by split slova bombs...
---
I would ask PS for a refund then get the legendary edition.
---
I thought I was the only one that did this &lt;3 ill never let go of it! 
---
This would be epic, I'd look like escaflowne
---
Yeah its my best bet.
---
No shame at all, huh?
---
Anyone know that shader tho? 
---
PS has a weird refund policy but since you cant even play it you should be good.
---
second DLC The Warmind tells the story of Ana Bray, Zavala, and our favorite Warmind.
---
for exotics
---
weapons: Huckleberry, Suros Regime, Polaris Lance, Worldline Zero, Sleeper Simulant, and Whisper of the Worm.
---
armor same order:
---
Eternal Warrior, Wormgod Caress, Ashen Wake,  Armamentarium
---
Wormhusk Crown, Sealed Ahamkara Grasps, Ophidia Spathe, Fr0st-EE5
---
Verity's Brow, Apotheosis Veil, Claws of Ahamkara, Sanguine Alchemy.
---
Who's ready for the kids choice awards
---
Probably one of the sleeper node weapons lol
---
Yeah, weird they sell it like this even. Maybe for people who just own base game. I should have taken it back when it was free i guess. Wasnt interested tho, now with Anthem failing hard iv decided to give this game a go. 
---
It used to be fourth times the charm but you are right, totally forgot about it.
---
Yeah, nova warp was kinda ridiculous being able to kill other supers in one blast some times, But it's also a good example of what happens when you nerf a super too far into the ground and it ends up becoming almost useless, this almost happened to Blade Barrage but it ended up being mostly unaffected in pvp and most of the nerf ended up being in pve which was really weird since it wasn't super dominant in pve to begin with and celestial already did more damage then blade barrage, and the shards of galanor nerf was just fucking stupid, they were already super inconsistent, no other super regen on use exotic has a cap on regeneration like shards does.
---
correct, it's in collections but it says it drops from bright engrams
---
I LOVE that smoke effect you've got going!
---
exactly, and JUST to spite her, I'm #TeamDrifter
---
Peak that corner, I'll dome ya right now
---
If you stand in front of a mirror and say  “allright”  7 times; shaved drifter apears....
---
That's pretty much how i was too and I'm loving it
---
Therapist: “Dragon’s Breath sparrow isn’t real, it can’t hurt you.”
---
Dragon’s Breath sparrow:
---
Really hoping they add it soon. Definitely my favorite sparrow so far 
---
How would somebody help you on this? You're on your own for this one. Try using a 180 as the recoil is manageable. I think I did mine with a better devils, and it took me forever. Good luck.

Holy shit, that's what this is? By far my favorite Destiny concept art and I never knew it was anything more than an exo.
---
My dude ready just took a screenshot of someone else's post and posted it for himself..
---
That's because it can one shot, people love that. 
---
Shotguns used to be the biggest thing in the crucible, and are still huge. Doesn't change that you just need to fight them from range 
---
Can relate, although sometimes I get the last word.
---
I used to be like you until i got the new eververse warlock chest. 
---
This is why you run a Slowva Bomb skull warlock to 1-hit these assholes as they spawn.
---
My stupid trick is to spam bounce sentinel shields around corners and praying real hard.
---
FF/KC Blast Furnace, Jötunn, Hammerhead.
---
Joji?
---
How so?
---
Can it be fixed though? I think the real issue is our tiny crucible maps were not designed for our current movement speed; aka the “go fast” update.
---
True! Nova warp was weakened a lot. Its still got some effectivity over other supers but its not insane. The blade barrage nerf was very weird tbh. I find myself using golden gun with the one shot powerful helmet. Blade barrage ks konda meh now in pve
---
Listen if you read the post image and my responses you would have seen that I said something came up. I didn’t go into comp because I wanted to screw my team I went in to try to win like everyone else.
---
I’m sorry if I can’t make my family that is putting house over head while I’m in college on hold to become an ultimate weapon of crucible. 
---
I’m sorry if this seems toxic but it bothers me that you said I that don’t understand that I did something wrong, when in a comment to this I stated that I did deserve to get hate mailed but not by a guy who rage quits half way into the game.
---
Bottom line is stuff comes up out of the blue I’m sorry that I messed up my three teammates game. I’m sorry I can’t control when I have to drop the control and help out with things all the time.
---
180 hand cannons are your friend. 
---
Unfortunately, there's not a whole lot you can do. It's gonna take a bit of time. As someone who stays out of the Crucible outside of weekly stuff and Quests, here's my two cents. 
---
One: find a handcannon you like. Ones that are generally accepted as good and are easily accessible are Midnight Coup, which drops from the Leviathan Raid; and Trust, which drops from Gambit; Duke Mk. 44, which drops from general Forsaken world stuff; Better Devils, which drops from Crucible stuff; and the Service Revolver, which you can get from Zavala. Good perks to watch out for are Outlaw, Rampage, Drop Mag, Kill Clip, Feeding Frenzy, and Dragonfly. Don't worry too much about which one you use as long as it's one YOU feel comfortable with, because you're gonna be using it a lot. 
---
Two: Maybe find some friends who are decent at Crucible who can watch your back. I ran solo for most of it, but not getting matchmade into a team with players who just installed yesterday can go a long way to making the game easier. 
---
Three: Jam a bunch of Crucible. Focus on getting headshots. Maybe even go in packing two Handcannons.  Check your armor sets for any perks that increase precision for Handcannons. 
---
Four: Be patient. If you don't play a lot of Crucible, this is gonna take time. If you start getting frustrated, go do something else for a while. Headshots are easier to hit if you're not one more loss away from snapping your controller or Mouse/Keyboard in half. 
---
Shame on you
---
Use your mobile browser if your app has problems opening my links.  
---
Cayde did run with the drifter though, so who knows
---
Spellcheck fail! Fixed. Lol
---
The raids, black armory and gambit prime/reckoning drops all drop much higher than 1LL. I have just stopped doing everything else, got all three characters to 666+ by just doing those three things this week. 
---
Hey, what the hell do you think your doing with that
---
I don't know and I don't want to know you, but I wanna punch you and took your fricking luck from you. Dammit
---
Lmao you’re getting downvoted for being right. They nerfed Gwisin last update. 
---
It can be VERY terrifying sometimes 
---
wait is it a cursed week?
---
They just open a higher light version of them. So you have a 200,300,400,500, and maybe a 600 matchmaking. It wont put you in the 500 if you arent ready for it. So do not worry.
---
My current favourite fun gambit setup is synthoceps and lower tier striker. With biotic enabled you can punch out centurions down while they are floating. Triple punch off one jump muahahaha.
---
*sees that you are a man of culture* For other not so culturally aware guardians.
---
https://youtu.be/_oACRt-Qp-s 
---
That could definitely be an explanation 
---
Um I see, I guess you are right.
---
Blatant disregard to u/bruteslayer
---
Not reaaaaly
---
Titans eat shame
---
I'm doing the same thing right now. Unfortunately, the triumph says vanguard strikes, so that takes out the lake of shadows speed run. I'm not sure if nightfalls count toward progress but I don't think they do, so it's basically just going to be a grind. I'm taking this opportunity to amass as many vanguard tokens as possible by buying boons to use before every strike. This will also be a good chance to work on the Pinnacle scout rifle triumph. hope this helps. Best of luck. 
---
Ooh ok. So the item I infuse becomes the level of the item I sacrifice?
---
And what about the Enhancement Cores? I have yet to see any (just started Forsaken, level 39). Are they a max level drop?
---
When your playing raids and you hear his voice over the intercom 😭
---
Just wanted to jump in and say that all glory points have been doubled this season. Most importantly, this includes the bonus points for completing three games each week. The best advice I’ve ever been given on the grind to Luna’s is to not give up or put it off until the end of the season. Odds are you’ll win a couple of them and the bonus points will offset any losses. I know solo queueing can be a crapshoot, especially in the early season when there’s no rhyme or reason to where people are at with their glory, but maybe you’ll find another solo queue-er or two that you jive with and now you’ve got the makings of a comp team. 
---
Very true. So are you going for the full collection then?
---
It is now
---
No, that starts tomorrow
---
The helmet stayed on
---
[No it fucking doesn't](https://streamable.com/novmf)
---
Me too, never sharding that gun, I know it's the exact same from collections but it doesn't feel right
---
I don't know anything about the lore or anything about the first game. My opinion of him is based on his actions in this game.
---
He was completely right about the Vangard not being an army, I get that.
---
My dislike of him comes from how cowardly he has been all game. And then, before the final showdown in the base game, Cayde, Ikola, and even Hawthorne were out there being badasses. Meanwhile all Zavala did was run up to a goon, fall down, and cry. He has done nothing impressive and has just been a whiny brat so far. So I just can't see any reason to like him.
---
I did that yesterday, screwing a team out of even getting their primeval on the field (one of them even had 14 motes). But it really didn't feel heroic.
---
[It felt much more like this.](https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2015-01/29/17/campaign_images/webdr11/times-courage-the-cowardly-dog-left-you-deeply-di-2-13078-1422569055-37_dblbig.jpg)

Dude.  This new ship model is literally THE MOST "Destiny" ship ever.  Im never taking it off.
---
Bye, bye, little Sebastian
---
Did you aquire it during Y1? If so, you don't need to do it as you only u lock the fixed roll.
---
If you didn't, you need to do 40 Strikes from the Strikes Playlist. I couldn't test if using the Hallowed Lair Glitch counts as my team-mates didn't want to do it.
---
Not you, THEM. I'm saying it tells you that they joined the chat because they have auto-join on, but no mic so you no hear words.
---
r/absoluteshaxx
---
Whats that chest piece?
---
Completely understandable. If you are at all interested in the lore (prehistory or current) look up YouTuber. My Name is Byf. He is regarded as THE guy about lore. So much so that there have been some people suggesting bungie to hire him. He has some bitesized videos and others almost 2 hours long.
---
thank you
---
Wow! That's how I felt when I dropped a $100 for Destiny 2 at launch. Glad to see nothing has changed.
---
Didn't miss anything.. if you have 3 characters you can boost all 3. Well worth the $ I think.  I got back into it when forsaken dropped and still haven't had time to touch my other 2 characters because I'm staying busy enough with my hunter.  Lol . (Not as much game time as before either :-) )
---
Uh... That's a little extreme. I really don't think it would be that black and white. Cayde didn't play by the rules. So it's hard to act like we know for sure what he would've chosen.
---
Not Cayde himself, Sundance (his Ghost). Ghosts cannot be killed with conventional weapons, thus you need something like a Weapon of Sorrow to kill a Ghost.
---
There’s plenty that do cross that line...
---
And they did do something? They sent you, you avenged Cayde.... instead of leaving the last city entirely Undefended just over one guy... one guy that certainly wouldn’t have wanted the entire city left undefended 
---
&gt;Buuuuuuuuuut, Zavala wasn't willing to avenge Cayde.
---
I understand this though.  He has a duty to the city.  There's some argument to be made for helping the awoken of the reef, &amp; preventing the scorn from being a problem.  But he was faced with Ikora wanting a war, which would leave the city defenceless, &amp; a guardian who wanted revenge, which simply isn't something a general can indulge in.
---
Vanguard is doing a bang up job lately 
---
Idk about farming for it but run a bunch of strikes with it equipped, the catalyst is a random strike drop.
---
This x1000. I hate when people say ZaVaLa iS a BiTcH bEcAuSe He DiDn’T wAnT tO aVeNgE cAyDe. 
---
It’s such a childish and knee-jerk reaction and if people took a second to actually think about *why* then they’d understand.
---
My Titan is 673 and I haven't done any of my Gambit Weeklies yet.
---
The trick is to start with your other characters first, and work your way up to your main character.
---
When you transfer the weapons alone, assuming the reset of the gear is 650, you'll be starting your milestones at 656 (or at least for me, i was at 656 when i started my titan)
---
Nah homie hit with the Rez token
---
There are plenty of Guardians to protect the city.
---
Bergusia.
---
it's easier to take photos with my phone, sorry if it's not to your qualifications but 260+ people seem to get the idea
---
Now give Zavala hair
---
I will go for specific sets first and then i will do the rest
---
But how does it work? Does it steal the light from them? Is that how the healing works?
---
It’s almost as if they could use one of their biggest Hero’s support....
---
Don’t forget in one of the exodus crash strikes Zavala is highly upset at the idea of you being lost and promises to come get you himself, he definitely cares, he just knows that being in charge of the cities safety comes with hard decisions to make 
---
The fuck?
---
The one that is left only has enhanced rocket loader, the other was infusion fodder
---
That is correct.
---
You get the Black Armory card from the Spider after finishing the campaign. I forget if you have to unlock the Dreaming City or not to get there.
---
Thanks for asking this.  I was wondering the same thing...  At least you can get your wins out of the way in Iron Banner and then grind the hell out of comp.
---
BTW -- when is the next Iron Banner?  
---
It’s really annoying. I have to do Blind Well every week and he doesn’t have to
---
NYOOOOOM
---
It comes out tomorrow
---
I wish, goddamn.
---
I think of the new player because that's what's going to grow the community, I actively go to the farm and get new players who have no idea what the game is about in to a party and help them I try to guide them through how to make public events heroic and how to actively be a helpful player on the game instead of being an ass and letting the newbie fend for themselves this community is about just that BEING A COMMUNITY and that's why I want these changes I want to see EVERYTHING players have paid for viable and an option for players. As it is it's hard for players to get in to the grind and ALOT of new players I've helped have left the game because it's just SO difficult getting decent gear until your level 50 I genuinely am trying to better the community here 
---
I've seen this before... Have you posted this on a different destiny Chanel. still Good work
---
If you have dreaming city unlocked in forsaken that's your best possible set as far as rolls go they are they only set that rolls with enhanced perks at the moment

Get long this meme!
---
4 stacks don’t want to fight other 4 stacks.  They want to fight 4 randoms who aren’t using communication.  
---
I...I retract my previous statement...
---
Same, I have them too and just can't bring myself to get rid of them. I wish we could put them in the vault or something.
---
You can blade barrage that quickly? I have got to ditch my Titan and play something else... We are so bad at burning Primevals.
---
Thanks for posting . Does anyone know how the armour works for Non Gambit activities ? Should I be only using it for gambit and that’s it then swap back ?
---
You mean... unfinal shapes? :D
---
Love it.
---
good ol gjally
---
Even though I am battling the inventory space in vault everyday, I refuse to discard Cayde’s message logs.  :”(
---
It's not team play. It's everyone against everyone. So people have to watch their backs more. 
---
I want to see more from you! Look at me. More okay. 
---
Helloooooooooo! What's the shader?!?
---
Sure, he can't officially stop any guardians going, but does that make a difference?  The point is that he couldn't sanction it.
---
None of them are THE ONE AND ONLY guardian. 
---
The one that:
---
Cleansed the Black Garden 
---
Destroyed Atheon, Time's Conflux 
---
Slayer of Crota, Son of Oryx 
---
Slayer of Skolas, Kell of Kells 
---
Defeated Oryx, the Taken King 
---
Destroyed Aksis, Archon Prime 
---
Slayer of Dominus Ghaul 
---
Champion of Emperor Calus 
---
Erased Panoptes, Infinite Mind 
---
Destroyed Argos, Planetary Core 
---
Slayer of Nokris, Herald of Xol

---
It's so long ago since i played the polaris....gosh idk since the middle of the hype from forsaken when it was already released i guess....well sorry then
---
I wish it were masterworked so I'd know how many kills I've gotten in cayde's name. 
---
Nah, don't. Got a laugh out of me.
---
Ace hunter mark for me.

I am 672 did all the powerful this week and the two raids.

I don't really get the accusation that the Drifter's in this for personal gain. I've gotten a lot of bad vibes from him about various things, but honestly never selfishness. 
---
It seems to me he just wants to push the boundaries. He's a survivalist, doesn't trust the Traveler to protect us and fair enough. He wants a power that still works when the lights go out.

I have a clan, but due to timing issues lately I haven't been able to play with my team. I agree partially, but the problem with making a game mode that puts you at a disadvantage for playing by yourself kinda sucks for solo players.
---
Have you done a Windows update recently? It might not be Nvidia.

"After installing KB4482887, users may notice graphics and mouse performance degradation with desktop gaming when playing certain games, such as Destiny 2."
---
Yeah man I'm sick of it. It's nowhere near fun solo.
---
wut

Prometheus lens 
---
Brilliant my fine fellow
---
Baby sparrow do do do do do
---
Ha! Honestly I was thinking more Undercover Brother myself when I got done with it.
---
totally possible, how does one fix this or revert update
---
They would make meme videos that look really real in the infinite garden. Like the get off Your high horse vine.
---
But tier 2 is easy tho
---
Zavala gave up on him.
---
Rust
---
I guess you are not curious about existing exotics in your collections tab. Hmph.
---
I downvoted him not for saying it got nerfed. But for saying its in a good place, it's not.
---
Then I should have gotten it the 5th time when I killed enkaar finally on the third draw. Problem was this bug didn’t count it and I died at the same time that I killed him.
---
All you need is to subscribe to Gambit Prime.
---
Well we did the same thing when we went against Zavala, didn't we? We ignored Vanguard command to go kill Uldren
---
This loadout is the one I usually use and you may like it who knows.
---
In my primary slot I usually end up going with breakneck for that sweet add clear
---
Telesto in my secondary as it just absolutely shreds and because of its perk harbingers pulse whenever you get multi kills you get ammo from your reserves and mixed with the tier 2 reaper set (multi kills grant special ammo) you would practically never have to reload.
---
And in my heavy slot I would usually go for an omg for both damage and add clear (so either hammerhead or 21% delirium if you have it.Use 21% delirium if you prefer more add clear tho.Hope this helps.
---
Also I put tried to on here due to its 30% damage increase in pve so yh
---
Praxic Finery. No comment necessary
---
Wow. A message screenshot that doesn't expose OP for being a toxic piece of shit. That's a first
---
Plus the double knife charge
---
How did you get to fabled so fast? I’m just starting luna’s quest and I’m not looking forward to it
---
Honestly you can get it within a day if you're willing to sit though about 20 solo Nightfalls which can take around 15 minutes each since Will of the Thousands is comparatively short
---
If you use something like a bow, preferably masterworked too you get the precision kills and orbs in the process of those NFs and a regular Will of the Thousands has like 200-300 enemies to kill so yeah
---
no problem!
---
Yeah um your gay
---
It has dragonfly and then a perk that says the more critical hits before the enemy dies the bigger the dragonfly explosion is. 
---
I imagine this has a cap but it would be so amazing to put all the bullets into a raid boss and then watch it blow up like a nuke.
---
I mad because if I try to say that on Xbox I’ll get com banned for like 2 days or something.
---
oof I'm not really triggered cause everyone is allowed to have an opinion, but I don't know how others are gonna react to this
---
One Thousand Wings is probably the closest thing we can get to that thus far
---
Which is mostly why I haven't used anything else since I've gotten it
