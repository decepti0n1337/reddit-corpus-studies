This is a bug. You can [view lists of known bugs on the Bungie website.](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/46168) There is no way to progress that quest until there is a bug fix, unfortunately.

But it‚Äôs coming in fall

[A recent Bungie news post with details](https://www.bungie.net/en-US/Explore/Detail/News/47928)

THIS IS AMAZING
---
I agree w you man. I want heroic activities to have optional matchmaking. I think solo players deserve to be thrown a bone imo
---
r/absoluteunits
---
Too true. 
---

---
I was doing a new run through the campaign with my little bro who just started and I was telling him how to do the heroic events. 
---
Suddenly come 3 dingus level 50s with apparently no idea how to do that. 
---
They stomped everything, fucked up the heroic event, and then left. 
---
The idiots roam in packs I tell you!

I'd just delete every ghost, sparrow, ship and armor pieces you won't use until September. I deleted all of them except 1 chest piece for my hunter, 1 chest and leg piece for the titan and the complete cormorant blade set for my warlock. All ornaments you've will become
---
Scorn aproaching!
---
I think while d2 pvp is p weak, I honestly believe it is better than d1. There is more variation on guns and I see alit of guns  as viable while d1 had the hand cannon, shot guns, lmg meta that never ended
---
I reccomnend putting a build together with pcpartpicker.com. great way to visualize your build.
---
??
---
Thank you for the tip I appreciate I lot more then u know. But another question is it wrong to help low level player to complete charms of screams
---
Is there things to grind in the game though? Besides the main quest-line? 
---
Also, what about raid gear ? When can I start with my first raid and is their a difference between PvP and raid gear?
---
I help them and I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs right or not
---
My life flashed before my eyes when I saw him winding up his smack
---
me when there's more stupid gambit quest steps like "kill invaders with Rose before they kill anyone on your team"
---
Rule 15 - - /r/sharditkeepit
---
It shouldn't. Forsaken and shadowkeep are the only two paid expansions once it goes free. Unless they plan on supporting it way beyond shadowkeep.
---
Definitely go for it, MT is one of the best boss dps weapons that isnt heavy and when paired with anarchy and lunafaction/rally barricade, the highest individual sustained dps possible without another guardian using mp or tractor
---
Nothing. Go for it. But don't forget your camera.
---
&gt;charms of screams
---
Do you mean Chasm of screams?
---
Talk about tunnel vision tho
---
The credits at the bottom are a great detail. Love this. Any plans to make posters? I'd buy one.
---
&gt;Is there things to grind in the game though? Besides the main quest-line?
---
Yes. As you get farther into the game, various side quests and activities will become available. 
---
&gt;when can I start with my first raid and is their a difference between PvP and raid gear?
---
Every raid has its own loot pool. Pvp has its own loot pool. When you can do each raid is based on when it was added to the game. For example, Leviathan was in the game at launch when the maximum power level was 305, so the Leviathan enemies are 300. You only have to be done with the base game campaign and be at least 290 to enter Leviathan. Each activity's power level is based on when it was added. Bear in mind, power level isn't everything. You will want to have a good variety of weapons at your disposal before you think of raiding, and a good grasp of the game mechanics as a whole. 
---
[A post with good advice for people who are thinking of raiding](https://old.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/ap9f3s/tips_for_new_players_that_want_to_start_raiding/)
---
Do stuff. Do strikes, bounties, heroric adventures, do everything that says "Powerful gear". Except Crucible. Don't ever do the Crucible.
---
Wendigo GL3, Swarm of the Raven and Prospector for power slot.
---
Swarm is only better than Wendigo when another player is using Tractor Cannon for debuffs
---
Mountaintop for special.
---
Orewings Maul and Militias Birthright are decent alternatives, but Mountaintop is by far the best of the 3.
---
it sucks when grenades can't one shot someone, even a 40mm to the face (fighting lion) but a hunter can stab/punch you and one shot you, or a titan can shoulder ram you into a puddle of goop. even at 10 resilience  
---
which means fists are stronger than explosions.
---
Good to know! Btw how do u get hunter next to your name? I wanna rep hunter gang like I should be
---
Nessus is supposed to be all similar though. The Vex are in the middle of making the whole thing a big machine.
---
Should I wait for New Light before I use my forsaken boost on my hunter/warlock as I‚Äôve only been playing my titan religiously?
---
I'm ashamed at how long I played this game without knowing there was a weak spot in the middle
---
No, my fate is always clear, when an nova bomb is flying toward me. I will try to escape that fate, but i will always be dead when that nova bomb hits a solid.
---
If you're capping the zones and your team is killing the enemy (thus preventing the enemy from capping zones while earning points for each kill), seems to be you should be fine
---
thanks for posting this FAQ. i have 2 questions
---
1] I got the base Destiny 2 through a humble bundle, i never bought any DLC or anything. i imagine there's no benefit for me buying the new game on steam vs. someone new buying it?  
---
2] is there any way to get Forsaken on steam? if i buy the digital deluxe edition, can i use those credits to buy Forsaken?

Also, I man Titan 24/7, &amp; finally got my Devistator tree unlocked on Monday. Is it worth attempting to use the new features on the Arc/Void skill trees? I'm enjoying the flaming maul from high-jumps...

Benedict in the Tower should have a quest marker over him. He will give you a quest for 690 power level gear, and if you don't own the annual pass, one free trial run of an annual pass activity. 
---
Besides that, you increase your power level by doing activities that list "powerful gear" as the reward. You have likely been doing these without realizing.

My first year two Better Devils with Outlaw and Explosive Payload. I have almost 20k kills with it. While not a lot for most people, my second most used weapon in the game is my old Nameless Midnight from year one with nearly 8k kills.

If only all Titan melees could consistently do that.
---
Dang that better devil's is love
---
I played around and eventually settled on skips with Shinobu‚Äôs Vow. I found the key was to throw the grenade at my enemy and then damage them (I used Wavesplitter), so the grenade would be the finishing blow. Generally if you can get them below their shield health the grenade will finish them off. I scraped out about 3% per match at first but near the end I was getting pretty efficient with the technique.

For D3 they should create another Gunslinger tree where the super is Golden submachineGun. The hunter conjures a burning Huckleberry with 30 shots that each have the same power as a GG shot but has shitty stability.

Heres a golden tip, use bottom path arcstrider and use recochet rounds to hurt yourself by shooting against the wall to get the meditation buff. (this regenerates your abilities fast) If you run this AND frostees and sprint during the meditation, you get grenades back in 10 seconds. I personally used the sticky grenade. Hit shields then throw it, gaurunteed kills :D! Good Luck!
---
100 dollars plus 60 for the game
---
Yea, the physics are just so floaty and weird, especially when you slightly hit something while jumping and then float away several meters.
---
I like the movement in this game, but it always feels weird getting booped around so easily (also landing on slightly tilted grounds like floating rocks and sliding off...)

From what I can tell, other than the occasional dropship providing air-support, nobody actually uses proper air support or artillery. Packing a few hundred guardians into even the Cabal base in EDZ is should ask them to be bombed into oblivion.

This is not the sort of game with clear hierarchies of one item being better than another. It depends heavily on preference and on what random perks the gun has. 
---
You can search a database of all items on a website called light.gg. [Here is a list of all legendary and exotic auto rifles](https://www.light.gg/db/category/1?etc=weapons&amp;page=1&amp;f=9%285%29%2C4%286%3B5%29), but it does include a few that are not currently obtainable. You can view all possible perk combinations, and when you scroll to the bottom, it will say how to get the item. This way, you can see if there's an auto rifle that comes from some activity you like to do, or that can have a good perk combination. 
---
"Good perks" for primary ammo weapons are *generally* some sort of quality of life perk such as increased reload speed (outlaw), paired with a damage increasing perk of some sort. Outlaw isn't that important for guns that already have a fast base reload speed, though, so it depends on the gun.
---
Yeah thats why its at max fireteams of 6

Mine came with full auto and headseeker. üòè

Yeah I think this got found just before black armoury actually. Still cool tho

---
As far as i know, Every armor will be usable in the new Transmog. So whatever armor you got you can use it with the transmog, and the perk config system....
---
Yes you may, along with prep, you need to know when to do which milestones and in what order. 
---
The key to leveling up fast is this...
---
Choose a gear set, weapons and armor that has a milestone reward source. I.E. Dreaming City or Scourge etc etc. You do all the milestones before your set gear location and the forges. Depending on your rng, you can cover all 9 slots by doing the forges last as well as your set gear location. The forge gives you a guaranteed 3 powerful rewards but can give up to 7 per character if you're lucky.

You never infuse gear that isn't itself. Meaning, I swap out high gear as I get it but as soon as I get something stronger in that slot the old one goes but I never inuse until I get powerful drops of my main gear. It only costs glimmer, no cores or shards. 
---
Repeat on 2nd and 3rd character and boom.
---
Blast furnace with feeding frenzy, Rampage, the perfect sight (forgot the name), Rampage mod and a range masterwork on top!
---
It does everything!
---
Also, even though I just got it last week, my new beloved with no distractions and box breathing. It just feels like an LDR in PVE. I love it!
---
This would have been such a good idea for a raid during Curse of Osiris.
---
Of course you have all raids too. Granted, it's very possible that all year 1 and two locations will stop giving powerful drops come September.
---
Found the non-warcraft or any other major mmo player
---
He‚Äôs absolutely hilarious, he mostly plays pvp but I still watch it even if I mostly play PvE. Seems like a really nice dude and actually makes useful vids about rolls and builds for different activities instead of just 10m clickbait videos with 4m intros
---
By the time I got to my WackLock which is my 3rd, I already had 3x750 weapons and he started at 730 before the first milestone drop. I had him at 750 in a few hours. Then I did 3 scourges, 3 Last Wishes and 3 Crowns.
---
Love it.  Well done.
---
The closest comparison is militia birthright with spike nades - u can get that from a nightfall drop just look up which one. Fabled via solo queue isnt as hard as it used to be, plus the revoker isnt even better than the beloved which is easily farmed in the menagerie so alot of comp players will drop off soon is my guess. Go for it and then when mayhem comes back around get the double and 3 kills fast!
---
I already have queensbreaker, and never use it üòîüòîüòî

You not just broke the curse, you breaked the code

His voice and accent are amazing. He's pretty good at PvP also. I like him
---
If you learn to use it correctly, it's really strong. Pairing it with a sniper or something long range works very well. If you can't get the hang of it, Ace is always a reliable HC. I've been having a lot of fun with Thorn lately. And the new menagerie HC, Austringer, is really good if you get some good rolls
---
You got what you deserve

yes it could

Shoudn't you censor his name as well?

You got a lot of shit because no one gives enough of a fuck about your ego.

How about an all out massive PVE war I think that‚Äôd be cool.
---
Eh forgot buy my last post had his name in it so, damage already done
---
I cried ngl
---
I don't understand the PvP salt. If people hate PvP so much stop playing it !! I don't use meta weapons and I destroy people using them. The meta doesn't guarantee you wins or kills. A gun is only as good as the person who is using it.
---
And make it faster while you're at it lol
---
LoW is/was really broken tho.
---
Play good enough at any game and you'll reach the point where people call you a hacker. Some gamers can't accept that someone is that much better than them.

Shouldn‚Äôt be showing his info. Instead next time try not caring about these messages and let it go

Try $120 on dlc and 2 copies of the game

Let the kills add another shot or two to your reserves as well as magazine

It's fine, you were using LoW

Yeah I don't even care. I barely die to it. If I'm close enough to be shot with it. I'm taking you with me or not dying at all.

Apparently it's possible to use LoW and somehow be at the bottom of your team. Must not be rolling his face on the keyboard hard enough.

---
Instead of the baths its a gym and instead of sumos its nothing but buff cabal egging you on to hit the bar for one more rep. The gauntlet is replaced by a cycling class. Dogs is replaced with bear wrestling. And final boss is a bodybuilding competiton against calus.
---
The general hate for this roll is two fold. Both issues this roll has are mainly crucible related but it does transfer to PvE as well. The first issue most people would have for it is headseeker does nothing in crucible, it literally adds 1 damage to a headshot following a body shot. this means it doesn't improve the TTK over not having headseeker and thus it is a wasted perk. The second issue most people would have with this roll is full auto while not garbage, is not really useful when compared to several of the other perks that could roll in that slot. It doesn't help you shoot faster than just pulling the trigger, and makes it harder to set your aim between shots, it also means you can't have a damage increasing perk like Rampage or Kill clip, which would greatly increase your TTK.
---
So i just leave green and rare if theg have fixed rolls and if its usful i use it to power up my weapons?
---
its nice but take the battle mag. or what ever it is called in english. And Boom you have one of the best pve sg

So if you do one clear + puzzle you get 33% which means you can complete it in 3 weeks

Iron Banner is up, everyone should try and get a swarm of the raven with spike grenades. Gets the full bonus from tractor cannon, it is an absolute beast.
---
I know it was for a while, I just remember he eventually got a new Gundam which made his attack the burning finger, and given this is a solar super I just figured it fit better lol
---
The last step can be cheesed by getting 1% of it, and then going to the tower, then switching characters. Rinse and repeat.

I assume its counting the seasons in the forsaken season pass

---
Take back the moon part 2
---
Cuz I enjoy using all the things I would normally just pass over. Like for the nade part I made a set up using ordance mods, the new demolitionist perk &amp; starfire protocol which I havent touched since D1 and it was a blast having a bunch of constant fusions to chuck everywhere. Scout rifles I pulled out the Jade Rabbit which I forgot how much I loved but it was still at 380 I havent used it in so long. And Swords I thought I would hate but I actually found to be the best part since I never actually have tried using them to peak around corners and get the jump on someone who can't see me or even better was blocking a spectral blades then destroying him with it.
---
That's why these quests are designed this way is to get people to try different things the game has to offer and have fun doing it. If you're no longer playing a game for fun &amp; recreation and it's just stress to unlock a line of code that displays some pixels in a certain way then you probably need to take a step back for a minute. IMO anyway.
---
I'm imagining the battle of Helm's Deep. Best level in the Two Towers game.
---
I did that quest on all 3 characters just so I could re-experience the end of that quest.
---
Xur only gives dupes if you already have everything he can give you on the character that buys the fated engram
---
Oof y‚Äôall are just finishing that now?
---
Imagine having to race against 2 other raid teams in the alternate universe. It‚Äôd be like the revelry to see who could get to the furthest branch. I‚Äôd play the shit out of that.
---
I didn't want to start forsaken for this reason....
---
He can only give dupes if you have all possible exotics from that engram
---
Based on the system requirements for Planetside 2, it looks like a good CPU is probably more important than a graphics card. For a pretty old game they're recommending an i7.
---
In any case, this would be pretty fantastic. Large-scale fights. Like one giant Escalation Protocol. I already spend a ridiculous amount of time on Mars farming for Ikelos stuff, and because I like fighting Hive. If there was a bigger version of this I'd be all for it.

Could be simplified a bit with half the players doing ad control while the rest have to quickly take down some small bosses around the map for a buff then after the bosses have been taken down a waypoint shows up for everyone to gather in the middle of the map or on top of a nearby building and DPS a giant boss (maybe 2x or 3x the size of oryx or bigger who knows)

If you're gonna be bottom fragging, at least unequip LoWheelchairs so you don't look like as much of a spud.
---
Not sure if your English is just bad, but periods or commas would go a long way to making this much more readable.
---
You should never ever infuse anyting unless youre refusing that item into itself. Resources, are not the infusion issue. It's people infusing when they shouldn't, too often or for no reason that's the issue. As soon as you equip a piece of gear that's highest in that slot, the game recognizes that power level. You don't have to keep it equipped to continue getting higher power level than that specific items level. You can unequip it put something else on and just keep it in your slots.
---
Telstar Graphics is one of my favorites. Simple with some flashes of color. Here is what I hope is a complete list: [https://www.destinypedia.com/Emblems/Destiny\_2](https://www.destinypedia.com/Emblems/Destiny_2)
---
Correct, you have to use the specific rune for rune 1 but for the 2nd it just has to be 1 of the 3
---
Agreed, I mostly just don't feel like anything much was gained from this. It feels wrong to even infuse the gear and wear my "fake" 690s. But thanks for the tip! I plan on putting my 550s back on.
---
Check out some videos, this question gets asked daily, also check other threads

How do you do *that* selfie thing? Plz respond fast

This ornament causes you to behave erratically, accuse people of being pedophiles, and steal artwork without crediting the artist. You also have a propensity to dig holes for no reason.

How do you even get the FL?

the non a****** response to this 5 millionth version of the same question in the past two days is pick up where you left off.

the a****** version of the answer to this question is use the search function and find a topic that's covering every question that a returning player could have.
---
I am do the large confusion
---
New 18 player raid confirmed?
---
Shaxx has the quest. Good luck haha they didn't reduce the grind for mountaintop at all.
---
&gt;You should never ever infuse anyting unless youre refusing that item into itself
---
Care to elaborate? I get not infusing something for 10-20 light but "never ever" seems pretty extreme. I can think of some viable times to infuse your favorite weapon if you're gaining 30+ light from it by eating a rare gun.

You could have just kept the 690 blue gear in your inventory, then continued playing for a few more hours and gotten purples that were higher than 690 in every slot.
---
How is this even a complaint? The gear it gives you is intended to boost your level, not be a super awesome armor set that you can wear into the raid. 
---
Don't be naive, these armor pieces achieved exactly what they needed to and anyone complaining about the game giving you a huge light level boost is just a child.
---
I don‚Äôt care I just want to know if I can punch it
---
Exotic drop, unfortunately 
---
They did give it away (with the catalyst)during the spring even, if I remember correctly 
---
You could use Orewing‚Äôs Maul or Militia‚Äôs Birthright, but those take special ammo instead of primary
---
Okay, sorry, I was walking down the stairs and speaking that comment in.
---
save your Cores and all materials until you absolutely need to infuse something. Meaning, that one clutch exotic that'll get you through an encounter. Other than that, you shouldn't be infusing anything at all until you've hit max level and you are getting max level drops. the biggest mistake I see in this game regarding infusion is people infusinh leveled gear into their main gear as soon as they get higher level gear and they infuse and fuse in fuse and by the time they get to 750 they have nothing left.
---
What? Theres a search function?
---
Mara stared at the Wall of Wishes. She had no more bargains to make. Her plans were in motion.
---
There was nothing left but the wait.
---
She pulled a sidearm from a hidden holster and cracked a dozen rounds into the Wall.
---
The cosmic balance shifted. Somewhere in the Dreaming City, Riven heard the Queen's wish and a thousand shrieking tears in reality cut through the space in front of her.
---
Lord Shaxx suddenly blocked Mara's view of the Wall.
---
"‚ÄîYES, AND WE'D ALL BE DEAD!" He was screaming at no one, with a mug of caffeine in his fist.
---
He started, almost spilling his coffee. "Where are we?"
---
Mara slapped the mug out of his hand. It shattered on the floor. She shoved a weathered book in his face. "I told you there would come a time when I collect for the Reef Wars. Read this. Out loud."
---
"No one tells me what to do," he said, grabbing the book and incinerating it in a bolt of Striker lightning. "I can recite The Tempest by heart." And he did. Mara sat and listened. They stayed for a long time.
---
The helmet stayed on.
---
But also remember, things in your collections drop at 20 light below your max. so you could pull an exotic out of collections thats 730, infuse it into your Masterworked riskrunner with 50,000 kills and then just wait until you can spare a 750 infusion or you get a 750 riskrunner drop. you don't have to have every single piece of gear at 750 to be successful.

I mean if he was playing like over-watch(depending on which character you play) or fortnite(pro building)then yes i highly recommend switching if you want to be top tier but if you are playing an FPS like Destiny or apex, horizontal ground based ADS shooters, with limited abilities and key presses, it's really not worth it.
---
I recently switched from Xbox One X to a higher end gaming PC and most AAA games were not only designed with controller users in mind but give a great handicap with Aim assist. i just use my elite controller and not once have i thought i was at a disadvantage while playing destiny PVP. I will say sprint turn radius and look sensitivity is weirdly capped on controller but as far as 1v1 gun fights go, if you are high tier on console you will be high tier on PC but enjoy yourself even more as PC bots are every, such as people like you trying to learn mouse and keyboard, where as everyone on console is for the most part at least average.
---
LSS retraining your brain to play M/KB is extremely time consuming and frustrating and unless you are legitimately trying to go pro then sticking to controller is the way to go, at least for Destiny 2
---
Kinda obsessed O.o ignore dumb people even if more dumb people are following him. You sound like that banned subscriber :D do not sweat it and enjoy the game. Bungie will not get influenced by idiots ;)

Great, now I have to wait till next YEAR to marry Shaxx? I am devastated. I have a...thing...for the horned mystery.

I may be wrong but I don‚Äôt think the fated engram gives exotics from the annual pass, only forsaken/year 1

---
Hasn't it happened already? Someone actually used the name for a band
---
Xur's engram only gives exotics from the first year of the game and Forsaken, *not* any that were added after. So you cannot get the new warlock helmet from his engram, or any other annual pass exotic, for the time being.
---
Serious?
---
Season late.
---
Nightfalls are 540 now
---
They are rough at 329
---
LOL
---
NO. You will not be able to get it from the Fated engram.
---
Only Year 1 and Forsaken exotics.
---
Filthy repost.
---
Imagine Revoker paired with Whisper or DARCi for damage phases! It‚Äôd be fun
---
*What did you just bring upon this cursed land*
---
For a while, the only Exotic helmet I needed was OEM, and I now have it (don‚Äôt worry, I don‚Äôt do Crucible with it), and I have to say, I don‚Äôt really like it
---
Dunno what they tried there. Prosecutor looks solid in comparison.

---
This is a really corny post.
---
Yeah, overall I think I preferred how Iron Banner worked last season, where you could work on getting each armor piece simultaneously, instead of bit by bit. This new quest seems like a real step back, it's like the "return to Ada-1" step for black armory, but if everyone in your fireteam is at a different amount of progress, you will end up having to return to Saladin after every match. 
---
I and one other person played together for the grenade parts, and one of us was a middle tree void warlock and the other was a top tree void warlock. With the exotic Contraverse Hold, you can throw grenades very frequently and get lots of grenade kills.

I think Calusea Noblesse is actually based on the other, older Queen's Wrath scout rifle [Vesta Noblesse](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/destinypedia/images/b/bd/VestaNoblese.png/revision/latest?cb=20140923215838). It has the same 'humpback' body style as Calusea, which Lethe Noblesse doesn't share.

Yeah you can't get different armor without doing the quest.

Shotgun -&gt; punch = dead warlock
---
Moon's haunted
---
No it doesn't at all. You need to complete the entire quest to add every piece of armor to the loot pool. Thats how it works now. You do the first step all youre getting is guns and boots from packages. Unlock the second quest step youll get boots and gauntlets and guns etc.
---
Well plenty of people including myself seem to enjoy them. Pinnacle weapons should take a while to get, you know being pinnacle and all.
---

PvP requires an entirely different skill set. You need to know how to counter certain guns, use the map to your advantage, make a loud out that synergies well, play obj, etc. If you go into PvP unwilling to learn how to play it obviously you‚Äôre going to have a bad time because the players who are willing to learn how to actually play PvP are going to shit all over you. PvP doesn‚Äôt suck you suck at PvP.

Matador range with rangefinder and burn damage to finish of weak opponents.
---
What?
---
Scout rifles are kind of ass right now. Masterwork 10 what though?
---
I was gonna be unhappy about people getting mad at it being referred to as queenbreakers but then re read the original comment and got unhappy about it being called queens breaker. I still only refer to it as queenbreakers‚Äô bow
---
Yo, what's that shader
---
Year 2 items that drop at masterwork rank 10 are curated. This means they have a special shader and a set of perks specifically chosen by Bungie. Some curated guns are good, others are not so good. This one is totally fine, but like the other person said, scout rifles are not extraordinarily popular. I only use them in a few different parts of the game where enemies are too far away for pulse rifles.
---
The memes bro

Props. Much respect.

What you‚Äôre talking about is what they did a while back with Curse of Osiris and the time I like to call crucible laser tag. Dropping into comp right now is painful without it.

---
Well Mr d1 vet, I'm pretty sure back in d1 if you didn't buy the expansions you couldn't play iron banner in the first place. Not only that but iron banner had level advantages back then too. At least they even allow players without the dlcs to play it in the first place. Honestly kinda hoping this is just a troll.
---
That's great information, thanks.

Not quite.

You haven't pointed out anything. Especially when you say things like "Iron Banner is pay-to-win".
---
&gt;I mean the president of my company nearly makes my yearly salary every week but i don't see why its that big of a deal
---
It's a big deal because in order for him to make that much while sitting on his ass, you are being used and manipulated.
---
&gt;I know how much value i can give to a company so why should i waste time with a company that wouldn't pay me at least that
---
Because no companies actually pay you the value you give them. That would require no president/CEO at the top sucking money - just workers working and taking home what they produced. That would be syndicalism/socialism, and it's a vast improvement over the system we suffer through, today.

&gt;Why are people working for Musk if he is stealing from his employees?
