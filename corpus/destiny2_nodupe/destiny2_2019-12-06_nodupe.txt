Comparing Bungie to a multi-billion dollar company that has the resources to do something on that scale *without* having to dumb down their initial pitch of the product was probably not a good example.
---

---
Look, I‚Äôm not saying that Bungie deserves a break because the world of Destiny is something they promised us and more. However, expecting them to deliver on things they:
---
1) never promised
---
2) literally can‚Äôt promise
---
And then actively complaining online when you don‚Äôt get what you want like it is a sure thing to happen is a stupid thing to do as a consumer.
---

---
I'm new what are Trials and why should I care?
---
Go to Holiday, get campaigns, start there
---
I got finished sooner than I expected to, so if you DM your steam ID on here, I can join up on you.
---
Man I wish those ornaments worked on any armor not just the IB sets :/
---
Bruh he said strike exclusive not console exclusive üòÇüòÇ
---
There is literally no point in playing quickplay now that I am at the soft cap.

You have a few trees as warlock with 3 different elements, arc, solar, and void. It‚Äôs up to you which you use, totally playstyle based. Go to Amanda Holliday at the tower, she can give you access to the different campaigns. The red war is the first one, and arguably the best place to start. 
---
The elements on gear only matters for mods, which can improve certain elements of your character. You can only equip mods to gear that have matching elements. Highest level you can get to rn is around 960 as a hard cap, but can go past by getting Pinnacle Gear, which is always going to be a higher light level.
---
Speaking of light level, that‚Äôs the power number you were talking about. Equip what‚Äôs best for now until you can get nitpicky. Alternatively, if you really like a piece of gear, you can destroy one that‚Äôs a higher level to make that gear match. That‚Äôs the infuse area when your inspecting a weapon/ armor peace. 
---
But start with campaigns, will help you get a hold of the game, you‚Äôll learn more as you go.
---
Because when people go out of their way to diss game services for something that is the player‚Äôs own fault, it‚Äôs not a good look for anybody. If you like the game, you wouldn‚Äôt publicly shame it for your own problem.
---
Its 2019 why are you wasting time making events heroic the math has been solved since y1
---
And the vex sparrow. And even though technically it's not a raid, you mean to tell me that the ship, sparrow and ghost that have the Red Keep look could not easily, EASILY, be from shit like PoH or Altar of Sorrows? Or even be the exclusive loot for Scarlet Keep? Or have a chance at them with every 980 Nightmare Hunt?  And yes, I know that PoH and Altar have their own loot but come on... Them shits look nothing like the loot that goes into Eververse.
---
Also, currency, save glimmer, it‚Äôs used for just about everything. Legendary shards help upgrade armor or buy engrams among other things. Bright dust is used for cosmetics.
---
It‚Äôs to keep you from immediately dying again...
---
It was a joke, but I understand it was not taken as such and apologize for my own negligence. Jokes may be funny to one, but not to another. I see my wrong and will do my best to learn from it.
---
I'd recommend you try on the forums over at bungie.net
---
Machine gun?
---
Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather, he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank just outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold.
---
don't remember how much each gives exactly tbh, just quoting what other people tell me, what i do know is that submachinist is slightly less than 1 full %, don't remember how much cold fusion is since i pretty much did submachinist only since flanking campers in momentum is mostly easy mode unless the spawns get you
---
Gg man
---
Jokes on them. The guys on the couch are playing Halo.
---
Awoken hunter here...
---
While the reward isn't the greatest exotic since it's been nerfed, it is required to complete the wayfarer seal if you plan on doing that.
---
I finished this quest yesterday so it shouldn‚Äôt be broken. Do you have nascent dawn active, particularly the step that asks to find a specific cache? That stops you from combining other resonant stems.
---
The quest is "The Machine's Gun". It starts from a world quest on Mars.
---
The loot sucks hard rn, but other than that it's still ok. But that is a big problem for a looter-shooter
---
No, "banshees favorite" perk is an exotic perk for ghost shells; however, you still can get any of the analyzer perks on the random rolled perk.
---
We've been had!
---
They're resurrecting XIV so that HE can be the new hunter vanguard
---
OH sorry I read that wrong
---
Zavala just *looks* gross
---
It's going to be Menagerie, with a less labyrinthine map, with Champions, and Hive swapped out for Cabal.  Also, the boss will be different every few weeks.  
---
Which all sounds like an improvement over the Vex Inoffensive.
---
How do you know it isn't?
---
Actually yes. Thank you. That looks like the problem.
---
Do it for shaxx
---
I see thanks.
---
Does the sole survivor ornament change the sigh of the gun? Do instead of triangle
---
I love my little light
---
Couldn‚Äôt have said it better myself. The season pass is $10(!) for 3 months of content. You can‚Äôt even play laser tag for $10. And the season rank gives $30-40 of cosmetic items by itself. I‚Äôve bought silver before and I‚Äôll gladly do it again, especially after learning that the sales for the whisper of the worm ornaments literally paid for the team to develop the Zero Hour/outbreak mission. I still pretty much only play destiny, and I don‚Äôt mind spending a few bucks on silver here or there to say thank you and get some exclusive gear. I shouldn‚Äôt even call it gear... it‚Äôs really just cosmetic. I‚Äôm not gaining an advantage from buying an emote, and I‚Äôm not paying to win because they don‚Äôt sell mods or raid armor.
---
Oh you poor thing...
---
I dunno how coordinated you can be with your team, but the strategy I used went like this:
---
1. Once you enter the boss fight first clear all mobs with the two turrets on both sides.
---
2. Then shoot the boss until the first servitor appears.
---
3. (If available) a hunter uses a Tether on the servitor and then (if available) the warlock does a nova on it. Ideally with Skull of Dire Ahamkara you get some of your super back and by collecting the orbs of the hunter you'd be getting it back to full. The same with the hunter with the orbs you created.
---
4. If you got supers back do tge same with the second servitor, if not use grenades and heavy.
---
5. Now destroy the Shanks with the arc shields around the arena if there are any and the proceed to the fallen tanks. If you position yourself between the walls and the tank the boss shouldn't be able to hit you there and you can focus on the tanks and ideal focus all your efforts on one tank at a time.
---
6. Now kill all the adds except and remember the 3 invisible dudes, they can be a pain. BUT keep one sniper in the back alive so that no additional adds can spawn, then focus on the boss with all you got. If the sniper dies anyway fir some reason a hunter (if available) should tether them asap.
---
If your teamwork is somewhat decent it can even be done with only 2 people. I would've helped, but I'm on Playstation, sry.
---
So then does Guiding light work the same where you can‚Äôt get it as a random perk?
---
I always do heroic if there are people who know how. But sometimes it‚Äôs just more work for nothing. Some quests don‚Äôt require it and people would rather just get it done than do more for nothing
---
Well, I'm not really sure we can agree on this, but I think there is some common ground to find. I don't think the community is complaining so much as giving feedback. The degree of value that feedback has varies, and some of it is pretty worthless. Explaining content gaps, what we would like to see, and comparing new content to old - really should not be taken as complaining. 
---
Did I make the best analogy? No. But I do fail to see how many and resources affect the very low level I was explaining. Replace Google with any company you like that makes a product you like, that then goes off on their own, to make an arguably worse product - and complaining is seen as, idk, mean, maybe rude? Like no, I vote with my money and have since the beginning. Seasons are optional now, that's reasonable. I just don't see it as the only way to give feedback to a company is not to buy their product, maybe tell them why, what they can do to fix it, etc, etc. 
---
In regards to Trials, specifically, it's just time to come clean. Put a date on it, something tangible, or admit it isn't on the table. There is too much unanswered demand. Not being straight about it is causing people to speculate and then further miss expectations. Yes, there is ALWAYS going to be an expectation that Trials is returning whenever the next season is, simply because Bungie likes to be surprising. They kinda need to knock that off, this is no longer a player base that enjoys being surprised, at least not when it comes to feature requests. That's best left for that 110% over-the-top surprise that we didn't know was coming and never requested.

Aye! Northern Illinois over here!

For hunters they should add a quick golden gun headshot finisher

There was a bounty in D1 called ‚ÄúAim for the Juicebox‚Äù for killing Vex with precision shots.

How is that different from Comp nowadays?

Fun % has gone to stonks numbers as last time it was rabbits and lions farming you now its Randys and mountaitop

They are not affiliated with the pyramids, very doubtful
---
Non-constructive criticism is valid. "Your product sucks," without follow-up, is feedback companies often pay millions and millions of dollars for.
---
People are allowed to bash garbage products without offering solutions on how to fix it. That's for Bungie to figure out.
---
this is the way

I learned about this from Dark Souls 2. Gross lol

Because it was just damage numbers rather than percentage buffs.

Yes sir adding more variety finally !
---
It's a PvE game first bud.
---
New Monarchy offered Zavala their support in becoming king of the last city (and thus basically dictator of humanity), and he turned them down. That‚Äôs pretty badass if you ask me.
---
I can not take people who pride themselves on sniping in this game seriously due to perks like enhanced unflinching aim, enhanced targeting, the innate bullet magnetism on PC of all things, targeting adjuster and stuff like field prep
---
Lol nice
---
Say what you want about Zavala but he'll always have my utmost respect
---
Fox didn‚Äôt believe in it, so they sabotaged it by moving it‚Äôs timeslot constantly and not giving them much advertising so they could justify cancelling it for low ratings. There are several comics that go with it now too.
---
*raises hand* Paladin-3 is a pretty neato warlock &gt;.&gt;
---
Hell yeah it is. Though Warrior King Zavala is...interesting
---
This is fantastic

#This is the way

Next Iron Banner, I'm going to record all the times when one guy runs off solo to B to die.

And set it to Hurt by Kermit.

This guy took Anatomy and Physiology

I was thinking Zavala driving an impala

Ugh. That's what I was afraid of. Haven't done any raids yet and was hoping to keep that up a bit longer. Thanks.

Ok sry about that was my first post here ^^
---
Ahh I'm on the step right before it. Gotta wait till tomorrow for the bergusia forge
---
I dont play as often as I used too so i miss out on some good things that are up for bright dust. some time if I really like something and dont want to miss out on I use silver

I still haven't done it yet tbh
---
Fr, also the new animation for the hunter‚Äôs weighted knife looks cool asf
---
The problem with your "season pass has $30-40 worth of cosmetics" is that the value of cosmetics is extremely skewed. If they made one reskin of a gun and sold it for $30, it would still be "$30-40 worth of cosmetics" as an item in the season pass, but it wouldn't have as much value.
---
Also, digital items have virtually no production cost to reproduce, meaning they are only limited by the number of players they can get to buy the good.
---
i.e. If you produce a real hat and sell it, you only get the value of selling that hat one time. You then have to pay for materials and take more time and effort to make another hat to sell, because that hat can only be used by one person at a time.
---
Digital items take time and effort to make initially, but after that initial investment, can be reproduced almost infinitely at no additional cost. Also consider that because a digital item doesn't require any real additional effort to reproduce and can be done automatically and instantaneously, the person who made that item can now spend the time that would have been invested making that good again into making some other good.
---
You may pay like $20 for a shirt in real life, but someone else can't use that shirt at the same time as you, requiring another to be produced. Cosmetics in a game are like if you shared that shirt with everyone else that paid for it, only no one is deprived of its value when someone else is using it. So, really that one shirt suddenly has an artificial value of $200, $1000, $10,000 based on the number of people that paid the same item; the real life shirt (ignoring usage devaluing it) would only have a value of $20, because everyone else would have a different shirt.
---
Unfortunately, many gamers are compulsive beings similar to gambling addicts. These gamers don't understand the value of a good and will blindly throw money at something, allowing companies to easily take advantage of them, and then attempt to justify it.
---
So, no; the season pass doesn't include "$30-40 worth of cosmetics". That's due to artificial demand, which doesn't reflect the real value of the product, which is much lower.
---
Why scared? You should start raiding before 950 its more fun than pvp and pve and you might aswell find some awesome guardians so your grind would be better.  You'll get used to it dont worry!
---
&gt;y stay within range of comm setups so that they can be contacted in case of emergency they s
---
well for the most part all the newbies will head to the tower, it only makes sense the people who will be showing them the ropes and training them will also be in the tower. hence why the vanguard has always kept a short leash on the hunter vanguard so two things dont happen, 1) running off when theyre really needed, and 2) not getting trapped inside a vex teleportation device requiring someone to help them.
---
Same with the Knights. **DUEL ME YOU COWARD!** 
---
Doesn't help that most blueberries are incapable of soloing the tough ones (looks like they blow their heavy ammo and supers on the main boss, even though that's the one you don't have to rush to kill), and sometimes they just keep shooting at the nightmare despite it being invulnerable.
---
You would probably like r/lowsodiumdestiny
---
End wishes.
---
I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs more play style dependent. Depending on what you want to be using more, grenades, melee or super. Personally I like a build with high discipline so I can throw tons of grenades, especially with my arc warlock that chains (PvE).
---
Get a ghost shell with guiding light and head off to the moon, grab as many bounties as you can carry and head off to one of the nearby lost sectors. 5 of the repeatable bounties net around 29k XP per batch if you have the guiding light shell, the lost sector itself may yield 3-4k extra. Also just 5 will set you back 15k glimmer, hit up spider if you're hurting really bad for glimmer or try cleaning out your vault. Other than that shorter activities may yield 5-10k each with all of the XP boosts active (not including well rested). Personally I would recommend both the moon and strike bounties so if you're bored of one you can hop over to the other.
---
What the hell is the original of this? u/srgrafo
---
One of the best quests in the game. The only thing not good about it is the rare bounty.
---
I did all exo without really any knowledge or anything when I bought D1 way late in a bundle a few months before D2 came out. I just thought they looked cool. Didn‚Äôt know the implications behind each or that there are specific dances for each race. Oh well still look cool to me I guess even though the helmet always stays on
---
So you would just become robot Santa from futurama? I like the sound of that!
---
I believe it's around .1% to .25%
---
Sunsinger warlock gang
---
( honestly though d1 has the better tower but the base game was pretty barren before ttk imo)
---
I just looked up that ghost shell and having two perks tied to Mercury is kinda bummer, imo. If you have Shadowkeep DLC Eris Morn gives you one after just a few quests that gives 50m chest detection *anywhere* and +10% XP and a random 3rd perk iirc. Just a heads up, Guardian.
---
That's too much words.
---
I'm able to help out after 3pm eastern so shoot me a message if you're still looking for help (GT: mwgz)
---
Yeah it sucks perk wise but I love how it looks. Might be great for this upcoming season though
---
Items are too expensive, bright dust is too rare, eververse is taking away rewards from the main game. It‚Äôs sad.
---
If all guardians were a flavor of ice cream he would be vanilla. Its not bad its just boring yet sensible.
---
Who cares? Its cosmetics.
---
That's funny )
---
But I was thinking (I know, I know) : Do we Titans ever do something like this to other classes ? ...Might just be too taxing for our absence of brain. 
---
Or.. maybe we think with our hearts ? You tell me.
---
Yea i haven't really thought of balancing this is just an idea lol good point
---
While I don't disagree with your point, content released every three months does not equal three months of content. It is not there months of content just because they timegate parts of it. I would consider something that takes an average player three months to complete to be three months of content, but most of the time spent in the seasonal content so far (not just in Shadowkeep) has been doing the same activity for hours over and over with no variation. That's not more content, that's repeat content.
---
Just because I spent 10 or 20 or however many hours I spent farming Vex Offensive doesn't mean it offered that many hours of content.
---
They're called fanboys.
---
The lore is great. The lack of closure each season isn‚Äôt ü§£

I‚Äôve been grinding gambit for reckoner quite often, yet somehow I can believe that bungo can do wrong. Who woulda thonked it

---
This man gets the 64 pack with the sharpener built into the box, not the small 8 pack those other guys get.
---
How do you mean?
---
I feel like a lot of the time people will start with a valid criticism and do one of a few things:
---
1) overblow the hell out of it
---
2) turn it into an attack on "lazy devs"
---
3) make snide remarks to get upvotes
---
Like I get that there are problems and it's right to bring it up, but the tenor of the discussion in DTG is often annoying and same sounding
---
Yeah especially on the final wave they just run straight fucking to it. They need to fix that.
---
Got undying and dredgen. Will have wayfarer tomorrow. More garden clears than I thought I‚Äôd ever complete. Got Divinity. Reached top 1% in gambit prime
---
Givin you free thumbs as he's been snapped out of existence by thanos
---
His criticism is in the form of a meme, a fair compromise no?
---
Do you live under a rock
---
Uhhh why don‚Äôt you stfu because they said in the reveal they have limited recourses so it‚Äôs not gonna be super huge content drops for seasons until we see the next big dlc. They lost a lot of recourses so stop being so toxic and just okay the fucking game.

Seasons don't affect getting this weapon

Ikora got Fedora'd. I approve.

Vex don't. Think they are quite vexed about it. Being killed by Warlocks wearing Fedoras.
---
"You think you're vex, but think how vexed you are after you are killed by the guardians with zero fashion sense. Yeah, your black garden can't shield you from the Fedoras! Mwahahaha!"
---
Same here. I‚Äôm married to this game
---
That seems a little shallow. Not everyone has the best looks. A lot of people sound good but don‚Äôt look very good and some people look good but sound nasally and annoying. It‚Äôs part of being a normal person.

Love it

Nice! What tattoo did you get?

Its been bugged for a bit. Get in a fireteam with a buddy then get an overlord in one of the other 2 areas. Tag the overlord with a bit of dmg then go and sit in hellmouth while ur buddy finishes the overlord off. It'll credit it as hellmouth
---
DTG is only half as bad as some instagram communities and comments I‚Äôve seen. And nothing is as toxic as the bungie forums
---
Nuts, my birthday was yesterday. Too bad I missed this. Still amazing though!
---
thats the facts, shaxx
---
Straight facts
---
Just gonna point out I think the word you're looking for is "implied", and no, I didn't. 
---
He can't be upset when PvE gets most of the focus, both aspects have issues, but Bungies focus will always be PvE first, at least until we get a Shaxx inspired season which I think is highly likely.
---
Are you talking shit about my dealer?
---
After all those motes he ~~made you kill for~~  handed out of his own free will and charity?
---
That would be a bad idea
---
Nicely done.
---
It‚Äôs interesting to me how everyone hates one type of enemy in Gambit. I hate vex because crits are hard.
---
We're talking about cosmetics here guy. Not weapons or gear. Maybe read the entire thread before jumping in with a dumbass take.
---
Nope, the numbers depends on the configuration of the week, so solar is different to void etc
---
Eris was* didn‚Äôt she lose her ghost? I suppose shin counts. But I am talking about ones outside the vanguard.

Techno Mario 80's porn obviously.

And his ghost he loves his ghost! Such a pal.

Imagine... using a wireless controller (was gonna say imagine playing on console but I don‚Äôt wanna start another war)

I was nearly this desperate. It took just so long to get that ‚ÄòProtect the Runner‚Äô triumph

Nice, I just have two perks left to get so hopefully it doesn't take much longer!

As a titan i like to suck on highlighters

Yikes well I guess it's time to dive into the muddy Waters of LFG
---
People bitch about a new CoD or whatever being released every year or two and they would bitch if Destiny did that too. I think breaking it up into dlc or seasons is much smarter because it's cheaper for the consumer and keeps your player base in one place.  Personally I think it looks like $10 worth of content, and I think it's pretty swell that I can still play with my friends who haven't bought all of the dlc or seasons.
---
That wasn‚Äôt a dawnblade, it‚Äôs the sword "Raze-lighter" from D1.
---
Then I'd say Shin or Ana. They're both extremely powerful hunters outside of the Vanguard. Ana controls rasputin and Shin Malphur hunts down the Dredgen
---
Mentioning early Firefall? I see, you are a man of culture as well. Was a blast when is just "came out", I still wonder how did developers manage to let it die.
---
So you're happy with how long it takes Bungie to fixes issues with the game? You're happy with the state of crucible and how it's been basically ignored since launch? You happy with yet another horde mode?
---
9000 I.Q. play from a fellow titan. Daddy Saint-14 is already making us stronger
---
&gt;But Bungie isn't abandoning them....didn't they just make a bunch of adjustments while also bringing back a fan favourite map from D1?
---
They waited months to fix obvious broken builds while constantly refreshing eververse
---
Then make a promise for "revising" crucible only to release another recycled map? 1 whole map...
---
IB armor is the same armor pvp players have already grinded for twice already 
---
They've been asking just for more incentives for playing crucible and all Bungie seems to be doing is recycling old content 
---
No new armor, no new weapons, no meaningful rewards for reseting your rank. And it's been like that for how long? Jesus how anyone can look at that, PvE player or not, and say that's fine is amazing
---
&gt;The PvE focus argument is perfectly valid
---
Just because you repeat the same thing doesn't make it any more true
---
&gt;foundation the game is completely built on, that's why PvP is such a mess,
---
Oh yeah that's why the Undying Mind was so amazing eh?
---
You can love the game and criticize it
---
But loving the game and ignoring obvious issues with it doesn't help one bit
---
Well i find it very unfair.
---

Dawning Crimson Day and Season pass getting 3 complete new Sets of Armour
---
Dont forget the backclash we gave Bungie for the first Dawning. i really hope we can pull that off once more because everything else would be weird.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I want to see every eververse item they are selling in the store. The Store from Guild Wars 2 is in my opinion a good version.
---
You can see and buy (except from the holiday exclusives, like Dawning in Destiny) every item ever existing for real money.
---
This way people dont get the FOMO experience, feel way more comfortable with the store and they can see what they are missing.
---
But this yeah here are some items of the season, but you never know what we all can pull out of our asses is ridicoulus and i dont like that a single bit...
---
Oh then the strike. It's hard. Bring a fireteam and it's not to bad.
---
Yeah, I've wasted many a super due to this. Or I run around making sure they are all dead, wasting time because I can never remember how many stacks of slayer means they are all dead.
---
Oh nice, gotta check it out.
---
Thanks.
---
I feel the same way, it‚Äôs not very fun seeing nonstop negativity and ‚Äúeververse bad give me everything for free‚Äù with a billion upvotes when I just want to see some fun discussion about a game I like a lot.
---
I used Jotuun to get cold fusion medals. To get it you need to get two kills with a fusion rifle without reloading. I don‚Äôt recommend momentum control for it tho
---
That would be epic
---
That was the intention until you see his point of view. He made valid points and so him wanting to just fly solo and not be on any side, that‚Äôs fine.
---
In my experience it's "the god roll" but with one masterwork trait or perk out of place preventing it from actually being a god roll.
---
Yeah, thats one thing that Warframe does that D2 don't sadly
---
YOU'RE NOT A TITAN!

That was an amazingly DICK move. Welcome to the Hunters.

I read something that Poles can flip every few thousand years. Possible theory is Earth judt had the Poles flipped and maybe made the Earth slightly the other way around.

Hey, random question, do you guys all play on PC? All of my friends have moved on from destiny but I still love it and have been looking for a group to play with as I usually stick with the same core group. I'm a new light play, 100 hours logged since about 2ish months ago.

If you use Honed Edge and understand how to keep it reloading back into it without double reloading, it‚Äôs a monster **with catalyst** at 4.5x damage of a single shot. Mix with lunafactions as well it‚Äôs the Garden raid go to over whisper

 ...  uh I don‚Äôt know how to tell you this, but the first thing I saw in the CoO dlc reveal trailer was that he had the modified sunbracers onü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇ  go look for yourself [CoO Trailer ](https://youtu.be/z9kfZbZ7AcQ)

Destiny 2 PvP is considered casual play, and even competitive playlist is considered casual competitive. There are no professional Destiny 2 competitors as there isn't a system in place where people wager or win money for matches.
---
A good portion of people playing PvP are just there for quest steps, daily bounties or catalysts.
---
In short, play with whatever you want, whenever you want. There are no competitive rulesets or restrictions in place. Bringing in more objective-based gamemodes and a method to wager money is when balancing Destiny 2 PvP will matter most.
---
Man I've had people who were so conveniently laggy they didnt load in visually till they were half way across the map, or their shooting was fine and they couldn't be hit. Or they sling backwards and are so jittery you dont even bother shooting them
---
Stop using "autism" as an insult, you ignorant fool.
---
*Juicebox
---
Your right it is a PvE game first no doubt about it and I'm not saying Bungie needs to stop all development and fix PvP all I'm saying is that the amount of content PvP players are currently getting is basically nothing, without PvP destiny 1 would have probably died off in it's early stages...
---
At least Titans don‚Äôt run away. Hunter.
---
r/fireteams
---
*Sad Bender voices*
---
Didn't mean it to be an insult, and I used it once. If you're really going to be butthurt over my use of a single word, then that's your choice.
---
This is the way
---
&gt;these people act like because they spent $60 on a game
---
It's even worse than that. People there act like the $60 they spent 3 years ago at launch should garauntee them some spot above F2P players on a shitty totem pole so they feel better about themselves.
---
The amount of time I've seen a comment start with "I've spent $180 on this game total and I feel ripped off!". 
---
Like yeah buddy, that $180 isnt even half a weeks pay for a single employee. That money you spent *3 years ago* is totally still on standby to be used for the changes you feel *NEED* to be implemented. 
---
I gotta stop lurking there, ugh.
---
I'd prefer it if he was a Titlock
---
It‚Äôs not considered a dlc on steam and it‚Äôs not out
---
It‚Äôs also on a ticket system that tracked your win loss ratio, if you got 5 wins you get armor, 7 gets a Weapon, and 9/0 got you lighthouse access. But 3 losses reset your pass.
---
Reee. It's awful. I try everything to get  in between the boss and the altar. They just fucking move around or into me. I blow my super and heavy on them and they're just like.. fuck you, I do what I want. Then you look around and three other bosses just casually walk into the altar whilst others are trying to do the same thing. I feel like you try to take one down together, the others just fucking bolt to the altar before you've managed to kill even two. Lifeispain.
---
It was fixed in October
---
Honestly same
---
Same  dude this was my first destiny game sadly only 2 of my RL friends play with me. Clocked in 200 hours but played half of those hours not knowing what bounties are or what the golden coin thingies are until my friend explained to me why he was already lvl 100 and i was 50.
---
I absolutely LOVE it when my teammate goes to the enemies' base to try and kill them (and die instantly) right when the primeval appears along with the envoys. Just love it, I tell you.
---
I wish I was Riven's hand in this pic
---
Perfect answer.
---
Hehe hehe, titans are no longer the melee boys
---
Counter-Strike 1.6 had massive chicken annihilations
---
The mission for the Bad Juju exotic was the solution for me when I did that catalyst's objectives. Go in, do it until you reach the garden with the shadow hounds, clear everything except the blights, go back to the stairs where you came in, wait for the doggies to spawn in and group up before you, shot one down, watch the fireworks.  
---
It might not be the most efficient place to do it, but at least there is no timer or wipe condition to disturb you.
---
As do I my friend.... as do I.
---
R/destinythegame is literally just a bunch of whiners.
---
I hope that‚Äôs the case, I only needed Monte Carlo last season but Xur‚Äôs fated engram doesn‚Äôt give year 3 items as far as I know, maybe that will change in the new season :)
---
It wouldn't save our cayde just a different timeline IIRC there are multiple of infinite timelines. So if we technically did save cayde, it would only be for that timeline and ours would still be dead.
---
Am I the only titan player who doesnt use the oem just because it looks so damn ugly?
---
No wonder he talks so smooth, he never yells
---
I honestly think this is the best one yet lol
---
I‚Äôm no joke playing the forsaken campaign while reading this
---
Gambit, a 4v4 gamemode where you have to kill enemies and collect the mostes they drop, then deposit the motes in your teams bank. When either team fills their bank, a boss is summoned in their arena, first team to kill their boss wins the round.
---
Every 25 motes banked, or a certain time passed while the boss is alive, spawns a portal that allows one person to invade the other team. You lose motes if you die by any means, so invading during the bank phase is a good way to deny progress, and dying to an invader during the boss phase will heal your teams boss. In this match, the boss is the big floating ball with a mouth and tentacles.
---
OP is playing a class who can summon a large 'bubble' that blocks damage. He invaded and summoned his bubble on top of the other teams boss, blocking their damage when their boss was almost dead, and allowing his team to kill their boss, winning the game.
---
Just to add to this thought, what about the transmat? You know, the method by which you don't have to park your ship and get off of it awkwardly, but "teleporting" out. Does it disassembles you into nothingness and 3D prints you out where you needed?
---
guardian just hit him with a vibe check
---
There is a sensitivity setting while aiming down sights... might wanna tone it down a bit?
---
Just a suggestion üòâ
---
Altough you have to stop with the crayons to be a hunter
---
I never got dredgen, the only thing keeping me from it now is the ghost shell and the ship, and everything else just happened through passive play eventually
---
Throwing hammer + dune bois
---
Still worthy
---
Yeah but you'd expect that upin finishing it, you'd atleast get some kind of reward. When I first got Destiny 2, I got an exotic item for completing the main quest. It's stupid they changed that because it makes me want to skip the other campaigns. I love story, but when you literally get nothing for it, it just feels like a waste of time.
---
Wow...I don‚Äôt usually leave matches early...but that would make me rage quit...especially cuz it‚Äôs meatball...
---
Nerfs are fun. Gaming is all about having things that makes you feel weak.
---
This! I have received so many downvotes over there, for nothing. Sooo many warlocks crying about how they 1) are underpowered in PvE and 2) have the ugliest armour ingame. Literally the strongest class in PvE that looks the fanciest and has most gorgeous ornaments ingame is whining about being underpowered and ugly. I main warlock for the fantastic looks and abilities like devour. Who else can keep themselves alive constantly *and* look fantastic doing so?    
---
Meanwhile my hunter alt's exotic: Some scrap metal glued onto their arms. Its ornament? Same ole rusty scrap metal just in a different colour. Gee thanks Bungie
---
Only hunters can dodge. 
---
Shift sprint dodge? Not that I‚Äôm aware just let go of shift when you slide and drop it back down when you come out. It may be annoying but you can‚Äôt slide and carry on sprinting IRL you gotta start sprinting again.
---
Agreed, though I would argue that it's Halo before 343 took over.
---
Will quest progress reset after the upcoming season change? Such as the progress for pinnacle weapon quests such as Hush or Delirium 21%
---
Step 1: get a kill with any weapon
---
Step 2: if you do not have Recluse out yet, swap to it
---
Step 3: enjoy not having to aim for crit spots because the perk doesn't work right (this is getting fixed next week... finally)
---
Step 4: Profit
---
armor with 100 intellect and jotunn
---
Its especially fun with any exotic armor which regens grenades or supers.
---
Oem gang
---
Yeah I got a lot from grinding 21%
---
It credits with only weapon medals.
---
Not sure you can get 40 season ranks in 3 days, but good luck :)
---
Is it most of the time, or most of the time you notice? If you can't with at least some consistency invade and get a couple of kills then I don't know if you're good enough to be making these judgements. Because also, why would you bank 8 motes instead of 5 or 10 unless it's primeval time?
---
The Hunter vanguard on a knife?
---
Classic titan with the most crutch loadout possible. good job pooping on him
---
Saint-14: ‚ÄúDo you have a crush on me,guardian?‚Äù
---
Me: ‚ÄúD-Dude I‚Äôm a lesbian. You‚Äôre just like the greatest Titan of all time why wouldn‚Äôt anyone not want a selfie?‚Äù
---
Saint-14: ‚ÄúEnough fooling around. We have a timeline to destroy‚Äù
---
*Saved it.*
---
I‚Äôm not playing with anyone actually
---
I think we need a side by side comparison from somebody who has the means to do so. If it is indeed the same speed as the normal knife throw then that needs seeing to by Bungie as soon as possible. That with Assassins Cowl will be a real pain to fight in Crucible.
---
This is.. Requiem
---
Did you know those crystals are all guardians?
---
He‚Äôs not talking about you, no need to be defensive. He‚Äôs talking about the people crying over how there‚Äôs no trials even though Bungie literally never said anything about trials. Or the people still expecting season of opulence level content when the team clearly said that was beyond their means to do again. Large chunks of the community simply refuse to adjust their expectations from what they personally want and compromise with what the devs can deliver.
---
Watch these guys were trying to get Malfeasance
---
This comment speaks to me to a spiritual level
---
For some reason i cant never believe that im good whenever im in top 3 positions in my teams in crucible, i just cant think im a good player
---
With how long that sexy animation takes you could easily get killed by a Luna's or shotty. Even with the two knives and Monte Carlo you HAVE to on point or you're dead.
---
Destiny is designed to be played with people. A lot of content is either impossible or crazy hard without a fireteam. Join a clan, lfg, etc. Like I said, if you're on ps4, I'm happy to help. Just send an invite.
---
As far as you got a mic, I‚Äôd gladly play with you on destiny.
---
The perk is working as intended. Bungie just overtuned the hell out of it.
---
Normal knife throws are instant, there's definitely an animation to account for
---
Looks badass though
---
It even has a solar glow to it!
---
+ ophidia spathe/ assassins cowl
---
Yep, I got a mic. Send an invite.
---
It's still possible, just gotta go onto Bungie's website.
---
Three on the previous page are also blank and a lot more on later pages.
---
Yeah I felt like a butthole doing this earlier this week to finish my malfeasance. It‚Äôs so much easier to get that team wipe during the boss phase since people are generally more clumped up. Thankfully with a hammerhead I got my wipe really easily and didn‚Äôt make it too hard on folks, but I do wish these ‚Äúbe a burden on your team‚Äù quests would take a back burner.
---
I doubt it would effect average crucible play. SC and HHSN don‚Äôt take any aiming/skill to use while this knife needs you to be good with projectile. Well have to wait and see.
---
Just like my dick, it's shorter than expected
---
Top row is free stuff and bottom row is stuff u get from season pass
---
As you progress there is less and less stuff in the free pass. Eventually it is just the nostalgic engrams.
---
You get less and less awards the fourther you progress.
---
So no its supposed to be like that
---
Ok so is like his leg vex or and I'm just dumb?
---
Time for the _pro gamer move_
---
Because you only get so much free stuff.
---
I don't get it
---
Yeah, if someone pulled this off against me I'd probably just be impressed. I might even try to high five the invader.
---
Something funny I moticed in the clip they posted, the enemies who tried to shoot him were always aiming 45 degrees to the right.
---
I think momentum control was bungie's way of trying to make every gun more viable. Problem is a lot of people ruined the fun by only using jade rabbit.
---
An Ogre turd
---
Titans exist
---
It‚Äôs pretty funny in PvP as well. Helm of Saint-14 plus bubble and basically any close range weapon. I dare you to come in.
---
I did it as hunter with top tree nightstalker and sixth coyote. I used Crimson to heal off the acolytes and thralls.
---
Oh for some reason I assumed it would give you something at every level. Got it.
---
I already do lol, tho definitely dont look like saint 14 with my shiny pink and blue armor lol
---
Sounds like a you problem
---
I've been running into even dumber Gambit players lately, who do nothing but collect motes, exclusively bank at 15 if at all, and don't even shoot at the primeval or envoys.
---
Cayde?
---
Year one player. Crucible is always currently "in a horrible state." 
---
People will always bitch about it being unbalanced. Always.
---
How do you spin the knife
---
Griffith!
---
I mean it does make any scrub better so
---
Needs a lil more Shamonay and some HEE HEE
---
I think about it, but I like some of the good in depth stuff...
---
Man alive tho... if you aren't going to talk about how Bungie is stealing food from your infant's mouth, prepare to be downvoted.
---
no but close. It's a character we've heard a lot about but not really met yet. he is a hunter
---
r/DestinyLore
---
As other people said I wasn‚Äôt talking about you. You‚Äôre response is fair and well thought out. You simply are basing it off what we‚Äôve been shown and comparing it to previous grinds and theorizing that it‚Äôs not going to give you the same experience that you want. That‚Äôs totally fair. I‚Äôm just talking about the people who are just negative crybabies in general that complain for simple reasons like ‚Äúnothing that I wanted to see is happening so I‚Äôm mad about it‚Äù or ‚ÄúI wanted THIS and begged for it and they didn‚Äôt change it to make me happy at all.‚Äù It seems like wayyy to many people care and focus on exactly what they asked for and want to see in the game, and not enough people understand that that‚Äôs not how it works. Like you and I, we simply wait to see the next content that Bungie has created and put their hard work into, and we make the best we can with it. We do our part and give feedback when things are broken or not working properly, and they hopefully fix it. We don‚Äôt just lose our minds because we wanted trials or some super broken version of old D1 weapons and didn‚Äôt get them.
---
Oh the hunter from d1? i forget her name
---
Welcome!
---
Whats the name of the song?
---
Man I haven‚Äôt played Gambit in months. All because I got sick of being owned by Truth when they invade or I invade. Every fucking game. I could never avoid it and I just got so salty, I packed my bags and went back to full time PvE to save my sanity.
---
Shin Malphur?
---
i don't have 2 anuses wym
---
This ornament really makes me think Corvo from Dishonored.
---
no it's a he.
---
*‚Äúmmm yes, robins egg blue...delectable‚Äù*
---
Fucking beautiful as a bubble Titan I love that
---
No because content spans out those months. New shit to do. You know a roadmap exists right.
---
Well even if he is human he still has a thing for the queen.
---
ayyy good job
---
OMG. I floated in the end just so the boss dies before I die lol
---
I would really farm for it, it's an absurdly good gun.
---
Damn, I got mine like 2-3 seasons ago and only got 10,000 ad kills. Nice
---
So I just got shadow keep and have not beat the campaign yet. Is this something u get after beating the campaign?
---
I'm just happy to not have to publicly show how autistic I am at PVP, brother
---
That meme, up there... that's you!  Talk about "cognitive dissonance" you missed the point, and it's only right at the top of the scroll...
---
Any proof other than your own opinion?
---
Ive mained a Lock since D1 but i have one of each. 
---
Honestly this season i have been leaning more on Titan because i really like their arc grenades in pvp.
---
Hunter is my least favorite mostly because of their jump. I like the six shooter and ranged special but i honestly forget that they have a dodge and never use it. That was my main reason for making one lol.
---
Yes
---
Not to be that guy, but isnt it Swiffer?
---
You‚Äôre right! I did mention it as a fifth option and pointed out it would require crucible skill but I forgot to factor in how how long that can take to accomplish. Risk runner is a great option and another awesome substitute!
---
Or bring back the d1 trials armor
---
Also if you‚Äôre doing a quest that says ‚Äúcomplete activities‚Äù heroics count for more.
---
Double K.O.
---
good luck brother
---
What if we buried Cayde with a Spade?
---
Not forgotten
---
Yessir
---
I was playing regular to get hush and breakneck, people who play non prime are absolute dummy heads pardon my french.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs literally saying nothing. They‚Äôre just spreading rumours. Not trying to be a dick but I‚Äôm just saying to me there‚Äôs absolutely nothing that ‚Äúlooks like an SRL logo.‚Äù
---
Io for Saturn, Titan for Jupiter.
---
Sometimes when you load into Io you'll see Saturn in the sky, complete with a giant hole in its rings where Oryx's Dreadnaught waits.
---
If Cayde came back, Bungie wouldn‚Äôt put a worthy story to it.  He‚Äôd be a nightmare.  You wanna fight a Cayde-6 nightmare?
---
It is. It doesn‚Äôt even show what they‚Äôre talking about.
---
Yah, Titan is Saturns biggest moon, and IO belongs to Jupiter
---
I just miss the good old Hunter doge that had a cooldown of 2 sec.... (back in the good old timesüòÇ)
---
I'm grinding to reset my infamy rank for the 3rd time and Dregden will be my first title. I get that it's a mickey mouse title but I'll still be proud as I suck balls.
---
Enceladus and whatever is on it
---
Pretty sure Tim Allen beat u to it already bud
---
Man, if they get SRL into D2... and the horns.. THE HORNS!!!!!
---
I'd be so happy.
---
In case anyone didn't know this: 
---
If you unlocked any of these during season 3, you can actually apply them as universal ornaments to any of your armor 2.0 gear, not JUST iron banner armor. To do so, you just have to go to collections and reacquire it first, but then it can be applied to any of your gear.
---
Dang I was close thinking you were about to say wasting time in the tower which this is Definitely the biggest part of the wasted time next to emoting with random strangers
---
I did it legit on my hunter with Orpheus, top tree tether, delirium, recluse, Izanagi's, and hive armaments, hive barrier and hive invigoration.  The strategy was to use delirium to kill adds fast, and use my grenade whenever it was up to get heavy ammo. Whenever I had adds under control, I would use a honed edge x4 Izanagi's shot to kill a knight and the grab its orb and return to plate. I would drop the orb to kill adds again until I had them under control, and then I would dunk the ball. I would tether where the thrall came out to keep them under control while I used Izanagi's to deal with the knights. I would use recluse if thrall got close just to save some heavy ammo. I took this process very slow after the first deposit, regularity reaching 5-6 stacks of course of suffering before I deposited a ball. I just repeated this process until I had deposited 4/6 balls, then I grabbed 1 ball, dropped, it on plate, killed a second knight, got both balls on plate and then deposited both at the same time. I would use invis dodge whenever my health got low and I thought I might die.
---
And Tim Allen is definitely stronger than Santa Claus used to be. I don't think even the Hive could touch him.
---
That‚Äôs not being Dickish! I was confused and thought I was missing something and knew this sub sometimes has deeper info than is typically available.
---
ORB
---
Who else but Ca-ball
---
Yeah like I said I have solo'd it multiple times it may take a tiny bit longer, but if you are the only one doing the event it only takes a few shots with heavy.
---
poorly cropped gauhl on a nice marbel floor
---
I see soany people just spraying at the primieval when it's still immune instead of going after the envoys. Don't get why
---
I do this for all games that have seasons.
---
FAT F
---
what is mmxix anyway? i don‚Äôt see it in the seals. was that for season of opulence?
---
Thank you Ubisoft üôè
---
I mean like anything to back up what you have said cos if it‚Äôs true fair enough but I‚Äôve never heard it before and like I said most people shoot them as they think that‚Äôs how to turn it heroic.
---
glad someone got it
---
Nope. Not anymore. I think that was a Year 1 thing.
---
reticle*
---
That's why I go for curated rolls, I love you so much my  kindled orchid.
---
Geo mags+chaos reach+bad juju
---
NASTY!
---
Why would we save the worst character in the franchise
---
IMO best hunter build for 3rd encounter is wormhusk crown, top tree arcstrider, arc battery, crimson, secondary sniper(I used rampage beloved), and wendigo, crimson makes dealing with regular ad spawns a breeze, the rest of the build is tuned to killing knights and dealing with the onslaught after you dunk, sniper can dps knights about 5 shots from 90 rpm, and seal with Boomer knights easily if you clear middle before you dunk, arcstrider, wormhusk, and arc battery means that while there are thrall on you you are basically invincible,so if you miss killing a Boomer knight or even both you can recover, by constantly meleeing and dodging. Wendigo is great just for blinding nades, they can save you if you get overwhelmed, stun massive clumps of ads, and makes grabbing orbs easy. W/ this strat I've first tried it more times than nought and it has become the least stressful part of a solo flawless.
---
U did not just...
---
This. You get it straight away for buying the season pass but you can get it for free by grinding out your artifact.
---
You are not the clown you are the entire circus
---
He‚Äôs right tho
---
With a group of people it probably wouldn't matter anyways because most of these blueberries dont get on here anyways. I am going to try to record a video in a few minutes of how much of a difference shooting the blight makes tho.
---
Oh I‚Äôm I suppose to post something about hunter sucking?
---
 This is the way
---
This season has been a freakin banger for me!
---
1. Solo flawless Pit of Heresy
---
2.  Week one Garden of Salvation
---
3.  Three-man Garden of Salvation
---
4. Two-man Queenswalk
---
5. Flawless Garden of Salvation
---
6. Being top 150 in elimination
---
7. Many, many comp carries
---
This season has been a personal high for me, I wish the best to everyone else and hope the next season is as fruitful for us all!
---
That would be interstellar thanks!
---
*What does it mean to be a Hunter? I say it's all about where you belong. The Warlocks have their libraries, the Titans have their walls... but Hunters belong in the wilds. Out there, you wanna live? You better have a quick shot, or a sharp blade.*"
---
What about Supers...?
---
The lost sector on the Edz Excavation site Xll has a fair drop rate of getting a great shot gun called Dust Rock Blues.
---
Told another dude this but equip Feedback Fence. You can get x3 Fury Conductor from ads and put a BankBubble up. Since you're not wearing Helm of Saint-14 they'll think it's safe to punch you and... well... Boom.
---
Seasons are character locked and dlc system locked by my understanding. Bungie warns to setup cross save before login for them with shadowkeep and shadowkeep deluxe so they have the season pass on the correct characters.
---
Barrier shield tho...
---
Should wait till the next season and also wait till winter sale comes.
---
You don't just dodge and get the knife back. You need to dodge next to an opponent to refresh the melee. Nobody is going to dodge to get an extra knife while in a fight. The knife looks like it has a wind up time of about 1 second, you know what kills faster then 1 second? Most of the weapons used in PVP. The knife will be pretty fun and I'm sure will see some bonks clips but I doubt it will be as frustrating as shoulder charge or HHMN.
---
Warlocks have always been balanced. Hunter and Titans were always the broken classes.
---
Coolio just wanted a second opinion, think I'm gonna take the plunge on Xbox and fingers crossed
---
Man. Getting to Legend and getting NF was probably the best feeling I've had in a game for such a long time. Especially with all the doubt I had when I decided I want to go for it a few weeks ago. At some point I thought I wouldn't make it this season. Just start early next season and you'll be good.
---
Great job!
---
It bounces once too so it opens up to some awesome kills round corners if you get a precision hit
---
To answer your question, to the best of my ability. I believe your season pass will be accessible on both consoles. As the season pass is linked to the bungie account rather than the console
---
What class do you main?
---
Now we just need a Spade-6 to wield it
---
I'll take it brother, will let you know when I know.
---
The season pass items are earned throughout you‚Äôre gameplay as you level up you get the ornaments and weapons within the season pass. At the end of the pass you should have the weapons and ornaments and everything the pass gives you.
---
I disagree, they should give us the Halo butt stroke. Melee from behind one hits, that's all.
---
Warlock
---
Glad I could help üòÅ
---
Will check it out
---
Make sure your ps4 is your cross save host characters
---
Not really
---
I dont understand, do I just play to get them or is there some kind of new leveling system that is only for the season pass?
---
Same, what subclass do you use the most?
---
Too true
---
They definitely are my Xbox characters have nothing, Im going to purchase now on the box
---
You used colony.
---
The fastest way to level up the season pass is through bounties. Weekly bounties give the most, then normal bounties, and then additional bounties.
---
I agree
---
Have you seen a Flood model in Halo: CE? Not to mention the soundtrack was more fitting.
---
Hope it goes well
---
He learned this move from when another titan bubbled off his crayons preventing him from eating them, so now he does this to stop other from eating their own crayons.
---
 - probably how it gets processed in a titan brain
---
So what im hearing is pre forsaken shoulder charge
---
That also happens when I turn bounties with Valor points in it, while I'm in the Crucible. 
---
And then I get killed.
---
I'm totally going to try this.
---
Nice. This reminds me of when I got ‚ÄúWe ran out of medals‚Äù during the beta and I was playing so ‚Äòtactifully‚Äô when I realized I almost had it and jumped off the map by accident as I got my 25th kill
---
Y'all are lucky, 500 silver is the only option for me.
---
Didn't want to risk it and if I killed him, I would not be able to get this clip lol
---
Hunters have the best mobility, third eye, infinite blade barrage, invis and instant reload.
---
I brought Leviathan's Breath into Gambit Prime last night. Nobody was prepared.
---
I always start my day with a fresh controller.
---
Sorry I should have put /s
---
It was sarcasm
---
That's actually a brilliant answer!
---
Yeah everybody in fireteam has done it, not sure why he's not showing up still
---
Congratulations on your emblem.
---
Coincidently, I was doing that bounty lol. But bounty or not, I‚Äôm always trying for the heroic.
---
The other one-shots are countered by weapons as well (shotguns against shoulder charge etc.), that's not my point. Getting them back so easily without needing any special equipment is what's dumb.
---
I apologize if I'm wrong but I'm pretty sure you have to rebuy things in different platforms always
---
It will be gone come reset on Tuesday the tenth for new season.
---
One-shot *precision* throwing knife. Ya gotta aim for the head, and I gotta admit, I‚Äôm killin it when it comes to the dregs at EDZ (those poor bastards) but uh, we be missin everywhere else in Crucible
---
Lol **GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL!!!!**
---
Where do you get this ship from? I'm guessing it's just from bright engrams?
---
Can us titan mains get a crayon flare? 
---
So after being on this subreddit now for a bit, anytime I am TRASHING people in crucible, my goto 'meme' on discord is: 
---
'You gonna salt on reddit about that one!'
---
'I EAT CRAYONS AND I AM EATING YOU UP B*TCH'
---
Eat my rainbow titan booty-hole! I am tempted just to make my other 2 char titans just for the memes. So when I am LFG I can be like, let me switch to my other char...*Titan appears*
---
Yup! It's from S4 if I remember correctly.
---
Will it ever be available in the future? I see in the store there is the archive section in which they sell items from old seasons. And you're sure they won't be selling the last 2 parts of the set for bright dust aswell?
---
Oh my bad, guess I should have said so
---
Eco Friendly guardians
---
a golden daddy shaxx statue, i can die in peace now
---
There's a way around it. 
---
If you look at the old Nightfalls on 820, they don't have matchmaking. Usually one of the three allow you go back out and roam the planet. You'll have the long respawn, and have equipment locked, and be against 820 enemies. But that's how I do most of my vanguard bounties and any quests that do not specify  "in playlist strikes" (wendigo has this restriction, but edgewise does \*not\*). Some even have a bonus for doing them in nightfalls and on hire difficulty.
---
Armor 2.4 or thereabouts is when armor will finally be in our favor.
---
Armor 2.0 was 2 steps forward and 2 steps back. Literally nothing changed.
---
Really?  Looks like I need to change up my loadout.
---
I haven't mw'd a single piece this season. I'm keeping those 3 free ones + the one gotten from that one master ordeal i did. All mw'd pieces i have came from PoH and apart from a helmet and 3 class items, they were all pretty much useless.
---
Sex Offensive
---
Bungie be like "this is totally what our players want to wear"
---
They better at least mention it
---
If our guardian or ghost neither say anything, we riot
---
That's what I like about this game, each weapon feels somewhat special!
---
but the artifact goes away soon so it kinda makes  no sense
---
As a titan main I must say
---
This brought a tear to my eye
---
&gt; they'll continue selling the last 2 pieces of the set into the new season. 
---
The full set already rotated in/out of the store for dust this season and won't come next season.
---
We don't know when/how it will return.
---
I think it is only a insta charge with the precision tree
---
Hang on isn‚Äôt this the brexit party symbol?
---
That staple gun sound of a mida

Welp time to trap a friendly titan bubble

**Just To Be Clear I Am 100% Joking, Do NOT Take This Seriously.**

I'm on mobile so it might be different for PC, but I just go to the main page of the sub Reddit and click the top right and add user flair

We get 1HK that don't need a crit and they get 1HK that needs to crit to be a 1HK. Two built in charging methods don't suddenly mean they're guaranteed a crit shot. Just means they get another chance to fuck it up.
---
Oh my, so much to unpack here. I mean they quite literally do owe me shit considering I bought the Shadowkeep deluxe edition. 
---
But even if they didn‚Äôt owe me anything, they‚Äôre a company, giving your long time consumers jack shit and refusing to implement the changes they‚Äôre asking for is hardly a good business practice is it? 
---
A lot of people are having fun with the game sure, so am I for the most part. That doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt think that Bungie can improve. If you‚Äôre unironically telling me that Season of the Dawn looks like a perfect season with nothing worthy of critique, I really don‚Äôt know what to tell you. 
---
Finally, I‚Äôd say that telling anyone who criticises the game to fuck off and leave the community is a lot more toxic than the actual criticisms ever were to begin with.
---
Ah ok thx
---
People forget it's a video game and they get pissy
---
That's incorrect, you DO NEED TO REACH 5500 and get like 300 kills with Lunas Howl in the same season
---
Are they void tho?
---
Some are obvious like the graviton lance

...tiny enterprise with less than 80 vms üòä
---
Do altars of sorrow, every time you do a complete run you get 20-30 fragments and you can typically complete a frame(excluding love and death) at the same time
---
The same frame counts only once a week.
---
Say I do the Sniper Rifle Frame this week. It cost me a Ballistics Log (you get 1 from weekly bounties, so 2/week per character). I get 1 progress to the quest. I do the frame a second time, and this time I just need to pay Modulus Reports for it. I do not get any progress. Then I do the Auto Rifle Frame (cost me a Ballistics Log again) and get 1 progress. Now even if I get extra Ballistics Logs with my other characters, I can't use them on the one I made the frames with because I can forge only 2 different frames each week. Now I wait until the weekly reset on Tuesday and do the Sniper Rifle Frame again, with it costing me a Ballistics Log once more. This time I do earn progress towards J√∂tunn and Le Monarque.
---
Questions?
---
It's not the controller holding you back. I've gotten Recluse, Revoker, MT and Luna's  on PC (not Stadia) only playing with controller.
---
Legend is 5500 so yeah you do. also kills with Lunas.
---
Yeah you realize you solely just post pictures of your Titan right üòÇ but it was hard to sift through all the porn you repost to find them..
---
excited to throw knives and do 2 icarus dashes and throw hammers honestly.
---
That looks fantastic! What did you use to draw it?
---
How is this spam
---
Oh shit time to kill saint-14 again
---
Ok
---
Tis fine for i have an insurmountable skullfort
---
Ooh you think that is bad? Try using crimson valor on a hunter. Everything is perfect (black and red) except the fucking cape got a brown color.
---
I didn't level my Warlock and Hunter until this last week and used the Sub Alloy armor from the season pass to quickly get them up to 900+ so I can run the campaign and get higher drops. My point is that was the only good thing about this ugly trash armor set...please Bungo, never revisit that aesthetic.
---
Lmfaooo ty for this.
---
Randomly spawns on the moon. He is a big Hive Knight. When you kill him some floating platforms spawn.
---
dont sleep on exit strategy ;)
---
Why don‚Äôt you take about 10-15% of there bud. You‚Äôre right. You‚Äôre owed content you paid for. This is that content. Have fun.
---
swap to worm god at boss. punch to death.
---
Also you can combine it with Mechaneer's Tricksleeves(+enh sidearm loader if possible) and Baroque Drang with Full Auto + Swashbuckler
---
OR Lucky Pants(+enh handcannon dexterity) + BD with Disruption Break
---
...you missed the part that says "home server"
---
You can play mkb on stadia on a PC.
---
Can someone tell me how the fuck to get Jotun!? Ive been doing the forge activity. Does RNG just hate me? It is the coolest fusion rifle lol
---
It's a degraded experience. Drops to 30 fps and is hardly compatible to kbm on PC(non stadia)
---
I've also been playing on stadia(CCU/controller) and I've found comp to be a walk in the park at least compared to other consoles
---
It goes with a lot of different things because it's simple and I like mixing and matching armor sets. It also doesn't have any moss on it, which automatically makes it better than most of this gear in my book. Only reason I like the mossy hunter cloak is because it suits my hunter's personality.
---
True we just said fuck it and flew off with the loot
---
Also the way you worded your original posts makes you come off as stating PC players are playing with stadia players
---
Very creative
---
You can have a rainbow sword
---
Ikr, dude only stops lying to fap in his character select screen
---
Let's not act like the hitboxes in this game are actually hard to hit...
---
So kill rivin with homosexuality
---
The best PvP sword atm, and works nicely in PvE too. It's worth taking at least to get it out of your Exotic pool (from next week onwards you won't be able to get duplicate weapon exotics at all anymore). Personally if I am using a sword it is either Worldline Zero for the Warlock skating trick/the minor jump extension and the faster swing speed, or my Black Armory sword due to its higher impact and better looks.
---
You go to McDonald‚Äôs, order a bigmac but get a literal dog turd in a box. You go to complain and the manager says, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre owed food you payed for. This is that food. Have fun.‚Äù 
---
I sense you wouldn‚Äôt be very good at running a business my guy. ‚ÄúEither like what we give you or fuck off‚Äù is maybe the worst mentality a company could have.
---
Are all these changes right now or when the next season drops?
---
Doesn‚Äôt help that the servers have latency issues pouring out the ass
---
Sadly it doesn‚Äôt :( would be really epic if it did because I keep dying to shanks in the zero hour mission
---
Not with that class
---
Come Tuesday powerful drops will get their cap changed to 960 and pinnacle 970.
---
Which would you rather, 2-3 Seasons with content on the level of Season of Opulence or 8 Seasons of content like this+a large annual DLC. Because now that Activision is gone and their funding has decreased, you simply can't have both. Either the team burns themselves out as they said they almost did in the past when they had the financial backing to do it, or they pace themselves and this game stays alive a few more years. 
---
Disliking a season does not make you entitled. Demanding the same level of content as when the developers where backed by a massive $18 billion company right after they've split for the sake of the games health...does. You can ignore the fact that Eververse changed to become the game's main source of income all you want, but it doesn't make it less true and you're only gonna frustrate yourself because that's the game's business model now. Now, you CAN suggest feedback to Bungie about improving the system by making Bright Dust easier to acquire during the season and increasing the amount of Eververse stuff that can be bought be with it. That's constructive, and as you can see from the TWAB they might actually freakin do it.
---
This almost broke my heart... twice
---
Where is this man located?!?!?
---
I never said I'm paying for nothing. I'd just rather want the old DLC's back, I'm just in general not a real fan of the new battle/season/royal/whatever pass movement. I'm not saying that I got nothing for my Season Pass Money, I just tried it, and I didn't like it. I just felt like I didn't get enough story compared to previous expansions. The Storyline in general felt, and this is JUST A PERSONAL OPINION, it FELT TO ME, very flat. I just want to make clear as well, I'm in no way criticizing paying for additional Content aswell. And I'm not demanding for Bungie to be my baby sitter or even care about me at all. I just expressed that I dislike the current "content-Mechanic" and nothing more. Maybe a little bit whining, but that's just because I see a great unused potential in this game.
---
Also could be the Sittin on Riven lol
---
Dude..... That was awesome!
---
I like the idea of forcing a shield break by it. Maybe replace or augment disruption break with it?
---
So you‚Äôre possibly posting in the wrong place and you‚Äôre definitely in the wrong clan. 
---
Find a new clan. Just because you‚Äôre in one doesn‚Äôt mean you have to stay in it. Keep an eye out for one with members who are on the same times you are.
---
I love sweet business i find it very fun to prefire things by 2 doorways
---
And that's a fair criticism which Bungie hasn't really addressed, but it manifested itself into an expectation for a game mode they never mentioned. People read so far between the lines they ended up disappointing themselves and now want to act like it was something they were promised.
---
Gotta love those knockback attacks
---
Care to elaborate?
---
this has been by far the quickest method, i maxed my mobility as far i could slapped on exit strategy and recluse with peacekeepers and oh man was that the fastest 15% i ever gained.
---
Mmmm dat yummy field prep
---
Not all games have aim assist and you can in fact disable it. So yeah no you‚Äôre wrong.
---
If you don‚Äôt understand check @destinythegame on Twitter.
---
Ok thank you also if that doesnt work is spare rations better than thorn for pvp?
---
I would but i swore to delete every jotunn i get out of hatred for it in gambit and crucible (same with queenbreaker's)
---
Because thats what ive been trying to get
---
I mean, I get what you're trying to say, but I also can't jump 50 feet in the air and glide forward 200ft, cast super void balls of death, or create a healing well in real life.
---
Would just be a nice quality-of-life upgrade to not have to hit it again.
---
Why are there LEAVES! Just remove them PLEASE BUNGIE. THEY FUCK UP THE SHADERS I LIKE. I CAN'T GET MAD PUSS LOOKING LIKE THIS!
---
Unless it's some old 1.0 boots with traction(still haven't gotten it dropped :() and a scavenger mod
---
The first dlc for The Witcher 3 was 10 dollars. Think about that for a change.
---
Hooo thank god its December bc this made me nut
---
Causing the shield to explode like a matched elemental damage exploding a shield. Either replace the Disruption Break perk with this or make this a second effect of it.
---
Well hold on now. Shadowkeep was $40. This should be compared to Season of Undying which coincided with Shadowkeep and was either bundled with it or $10 standalone. That being said I find the roadmap to be more content than Undying was on its own so I'm happy.
---
Same here, hadn't touched a Destiny title before until new light and i already have all the emblems and titles even the unobtainable ones
---
I could feel your heart drop
---
I went with a Forty-four steel shader. Bronze and teal!
---

---
Oh ok.
---
Well I hated it the  most is mob get in the way of my target making me miss the shot
---
* Rage Triggered* xD but I just deal with it I really wish they had option to completely disable it
---
Ionic blink with Crown is somewhat usable, but even with Contraverse Hold, middle tree Voidwalker is barely worth HHSN. It's great for one on one encounters in Survival, but other than that, I hate it.
---
It's like playing with a handicap. Outside of 1v1 encounters, HHSN might as well be a short range fusion rifle that gets one charge every ~35 seconds.
---
You've got 4 days and you don't lose ranking below legend. Even if you win 1 game for every 10 losses you'll get recluse
---
PlayStation 4, sorry I forgot to put that information I believe this is my first post here.
---
Congrats! Any tips for people trying to attempt this?
---

Jade rabbit in momentum control

Don‚Äôt give away the secret!
---
it's a joke
---
What the fuck is out of heresy? I swear, this season I don‚Äôt know how to do anything, like the weekly Eris powerful gear task
---
It‚Äôs where you deliver pain/beatings. If on receiving end, you ask for more. If opposition can‚Äôt fulfil request, you‚Äôre probably last man standing by then. 
---
Only one way to the top and that‚Äôs through experience. I‚Äôm not talking KD.  I‚Äôm talking matches played, Multi kills, time played, melee count (if they‚Äôve 1000‚Äôs tracked,  
---
Follow their lead), etc. 
---
In d1, we had to get 9 straight wins. In d2, it‚Äôs 7. D2 TOS is more raw, imo.
---
Strafe or keep your distance. Mountaintop in Comp isn't that hard to keep away from.
---
You have to be in a fireteam of three people, one person with the forge Bow, another with the Machine gun, and another with the Sniper. Launch your fireteam into patrol in the EDZ and make your way towards the bottom of the map to Niobe Labs. If you search up Datto‚Äôs guide on YouTube then you should see the code your fireteam has to put in for you to start the quest.
---
It took my fireteam about three hours of trying to finally get it done, so I would recommend doing it on a day where you three have a lot of free time.
---
There are a lot of broken guns and abilities in Destiny. That is why it will never be an esport or ever actually looked at as a competitive shooter type of game.
---
With that said, I completely agree with you.
---
Even in solar singe delirium does more damage... so yeah i dont see the point of edgewise when there are plenty of other ways to get your grenade back and delirium outdoes edgewise in every way mob clearing which is the point of a machine gun while still also doing way better against majors and even bosses if it comes to that
---
check out u/sevenevans who gave me the idea with his art of the space doritos
---
I'm pretty sure the reason Saint is coming back is because he died in the infinite forest, meaning Osiris can just snag him from any point between him entering and him dying. Contrast to Cayde who died because of a flamingo.
---
Today's lore entry says that it only works on mercury
---
very sus
---
Because you'll be dust by Monday. Because you'll be pulverized in two seconds. And the cleaning lady... she cleans up... dust... she dusts.
---
Oh noes, tiddies.. rule 34 here we go..
---
but it says the red legion took it to change red war outcome... i‚Äôm confused
---
I liked the hunter one, if only it wasn't covered in moss and leaves.
---
Me too, sadly it doesn‚Äôt help much. It is very hard to headshot stuff when flinched. Try it out though, maybe you will have a different experience than me.
---
I just wish we had other non heave linear fusions to try :(
---
It's implied that the Sundial only affects things on mercury, hence why Saint-14 can be saved, but not Cayde.  It's unclear if the Psion's goal of rewriting the Red War is even possible, or will just end up fracturing the timeline even further.
---
It depends on what it is as far I as I can tell. The only correlation I can find is weapons I can reroll have a crucible or vanguard masterwork options.
---
I will when I get the chance.
---
I used it for 2 games and never again thing is broken and unfair plenty of other things that are either broken or unfair but not both at the same time if you are going to miss this you are a toxic player
---
Are you new to this game or something
---
The armpit from season 1 and season 7
---
Great, thanks for your help pal!
---
Lol
---
Oohhh I did not know that, thanks.
---
Dude forget him, will Cause be alive, but no technically it's the Red Legion, trying to alter it, but it may alter it her things
---
.... Does not compute
---
Can confirm
---
You're trading to the wrong skull then. Unless it qas changed with Shadowkeep there's 2 of them. The skull that gives them charges 50.
---
Its the "oppressive darkness" mod from the artifact
---
You lose your artifact is all I believe
---
In a world WE MUST DEFEND
---
Whilst the main sub can get annoying with its complaints, this sub with its class war immaturity is equally as annoying
---
Happy to help bud. If you have more questions r/crucibleplaybook is a really good resource
---
Chicken's not vegan?
---
Too bad
---
Well theres nothing sad about taking the time to view a profile it doesnt take 3 years to do so.
---
And here you are taking the time to scroll through pages of a game that is oh so trash.
---
Indeed. Although, I bought basic shadowkeep with same season situation. And not sure if I need to buy Dawn...
---
Looking on Steam etc. Can't see an option to buy it. Do I have all 3 seasons included!?
---
What's wrong with Mountain and Recluse?
---
But we just wanna come over to burrow some sugar :)
---
Agreed. 14 murdered so many vex that they even broke all of their own protocols to build a shrine and honor him. Shaxx is a beast but 14 is a legend.
---
Nice, not even close but nice.
---
I was at 968
---
Asher Mir in a beer?
---
Thanks man! I really appreciate it
---
Then gtfo, simple
---
Thanks
---
Cayde beat Shaxx in the crucible once but he cheated. Shaxx didn‚Äôt take it very well
---
I honestly can‚Äôt understand some people. Comparing the Destiny pass to Fortnite or COD, when in those games you‚Äôre paying for just the battle pass and in Destiny you‚Äôre getting Activities, Exotics, Quests, etc. Also the amount of time it takes to max the pass in those games are crazy compared to Destiny, don‚Äôt even get me started on that new COD battle pass. And complaining about spending $10 every 3 months? Just skip a trip to McDonalds...
---
You have to pay extra for that.
---
Damn.
---
I wonder/hope if we'll get S14's armor somehow.
---
r/suddenlywarframe
---
Mmkthen....
---
Totally agree. But then i wont be able to use izanagi
---
Ok ok, because I probably thought of after you deal with the three in the casino where you are returned to the Villa entrance, normally you would turn around and head to the Mojave but I did a little searching (mainly for screenshots) and got the attention of one
---
I‚Äôve never had an OEM t-bag me before but it‚Äôs always a hunter at the bottoms of the scoreboard.
---
Op: stoopid, I'm not going to let you get the chance!
---
It‚Äôs only *this* broken bc it‚Äôs momentum control
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇyou just made me feel 10x better lol like he still wasn‚Äôt on the top of the leaderboard , even after sweating so hard
---
Sure. I can get it back from collections
---
You realize this is momentum control right? This would literally never happen in any other playlist.
---
most GLs require a direct hit to kill in one hit, most rocket launchers en machine guns are much better in crucible imo
---
I really wanted one with field prep. But for the love of God i just can't get it  
---
I got the pulse monitor/full court on my second try. But cant get full court/field prep
---
You're right, it is the handheld supernova and not the mod
---
I wish some of the Titan grenades were less shit.
---
As far as I'm concerned there are only 2 good titan grenades
---
The pulse grenade for Arc
---
and the suppressor grenade _I guess_, I've never really gotten any usage out of it.
---
You suck long enough you'll always get some kinda reward lol
---
Just quit, you'll never make it
---
Sorry, I meant telesto, my brain is dumb sometimes
---
Ok boomer.
---
Save the turtles
---
He probably had a notorious invader set on
---
There‚Äôs everything sad about scrolling through a profile to find some relevant dirt for you to use. 
---
I don‚Äôt know where you get the idea that I scroll through this sub specifically because you‚Äôd be delusional if you do. I still follow the sub so ofc posts still show up in my feed. 
---
Also I don‚Äôt think the game is ‚Äòoh so trash‚Äô that‚Äôs you making shit up that I didn‚Äôt say. I stopped playing games that require excessive grinding completely because I realised how much of a waste of my time it is so now I stick to casual playing. 
---
Fucking zoomers.
---
Lol destiny 2 campaign and good story telling? I mean the lore is cool, but the campaign story telling is pretty weak.
---
There's a quest in lecturn. Reward is Love and Death. Try to get one with Field Prep, Full court, Spike grenade and blast radius masterwork
---
That would mean Forsaken never happened, which would make the game about 10x worse.
---
Titans are for men
---
Lesson learned
---
noice.
---
Do you wendigo gl 3 quest its easy and thing is beast
---
I got that medal for murdering everything in my path before they could touch me as n arcstrider.
---
Fun times

r/warlocksriseup
---
I believe it‚Äôs because explosive payload gives decrease precision damage.
---
I really wish they made ornaments for the Vex Offensive weapons.  Doesn‚Äôt matter what shader I put on them, they all look ugly to me.
---
I got it and randomly held on to it and then heard someone on Reddit call my exact drop a God roll.
---
Apparently your teammates are getting killed way too often without killing anything.
---
How in the fuck are you out of the map, I need to know!
---
Not sure if you meant to come off the way you did. But this game is great on console, and sure things may be different, both versions hold your hand in different ways, and through and through the games are the same thing.
---
The things that are good on console lean towards what hold your hand the most, (from what I‚Äôve experience) the ‚Äúmeta‚Äù on PC is more statistical. That doesn‚Äôt mean those statistically superior guns aren‚Äôt good on console, they just more difficult to use and less popular. 
---
Just my two cents into the topic.
---
I can relate so hard to this post take my upvote!
---
do you seriously not see anything wrong with using mt. cheese and spider smg?
---
Lol right! I feel like a dirtbag. Sometimes if I‚Äôm feeling really nice I‚Äôll send a msg saying sorry lol.
---
I spit on your staff
---
BONELESS GUARDIAN
---
I have an idea Shaxx soundboard that‚Äôs linked with buttons that drop treats for whatever pet you may own! Make sure there‚Äôs a cool down or you gonna be being lots of treats for fluffy! Just think about it every 5 minutes ‚Äú**I WISH ALL MY RECRUITS WERE LIKE YOU**‚Äù
---
Yea , that‚Äôs what I thought ...I just wanted to be sure before I said it‚Äôs still pretty OP lol
---
One... More... Game!
---
If an exotic let shoulder charge crit that make the one two punch perk happy
---
Nope.
---
Ok thanks cause I was doing pretty well that game was confused how we were still losing
