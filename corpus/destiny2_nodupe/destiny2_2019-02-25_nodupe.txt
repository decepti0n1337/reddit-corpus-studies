Hello. I understand we are speaking about nerds. Therefore, we are lowering all Fusion Rifle stats by 60 percent, and implementing what we call "Invisible Double Juggler," which takes away ammo randomly when you pick up an ammo brick.
---
Good motehound
---
The reaction would be r/perfectlycutscreams
---
Exactly my same thoughts. The way the phrased it makes me think it will not have the huge impact we were hoping for, titans are still gonna be too fast.
---
The annual pass is a one time purchase. It is called "annual" because it is a bundle of the 3 smaller DLCs being released over the course of a whole year, not because you have to buy it each year or anything. 
---
You probably didn't Hand your talisman to the Statue with the bow right after the ogre fight.
---

---
It happened to me aswell, i was like wtf am i doing here? 
---
Xbone! 
---
Yeah, I've done that one and I just... I can't ever kill enough enemies to get a decent recharge. It's depressing.
---
Hello yes you know how you can sometimes just miss even if you aim directly at an enemy due to lag or something of the sort? Well we have decided to implement that into every gun, and are giving sniper rifles an even higher chance of missing! Also we have buffed netcode by making people with pings above 100 invincible
---
No clue if I‚Äôm right but it might be the old guided games token package that people got when the game first came out
---
Bedazzled milling is a AAA hallmark.
---
You need to win for that to matter
---
Warframe grind has always sucked.
---
Destiny shits all over Warframe for single player
---
I‚Äôm doing so much back tracking right now it‚Äôs crazy hahah I just causally played year 1 and now I‚Äôm actually grinding shit and keep finding ransoms stuff like this lol 
---
They just really want to make sure that‚Äôs it‚Äôs bad. 
---
I gotchya, thanks Guardian!
---
Crimson Silver Bullet ornament from season 2, Thundergod Raiden Flux ornament from 3, the two things i want the most but can't get, because tess just decides not to sell old armor/weapon ornaments. 
---
ahhh ok. thats what i was thinking about.
---
Yea. Fuck you guys that did this to me all morning long today. I almost had the 15 mote holder 4 times and I was stopped every time after killing the dude with zero motes.
---
I thought it was bad until my friends convinced me to try it. 
---
Excuse me. My first job was bagging at Safeway. Theres no way technology could do my job and have a 16 year old giggle every time he put Tea in the bag. You ain't getting that from some ones and zeros.
---
Or finally getting an upgrade! Except its a weapon type you genuinely don't enjoy and you're out of mats. Time to go grind to use the item you grinded to get.
---
Try them both, but if I had to choose I'd go with the Bygones. Unless your aim is such that you're consistently double tapping with the GF. Or if you don't play a lot of PvP.
---
Joe definitely nailed this review, we should expect better from Anthem.
---
There isn't a seperate bind, that's not how that works
---
Where were you when \*\*I\*\* needed you earlier. Damn invader got me while trying to bank. He hadn't been in 5 seconds before taking me out!
---
Then they'd have to buff every other exotic so people will use anything other than oem or wormhusk. No, a nerf is the only way
---
Oh hahaha
---
It would be so cool if that was the first time you ever tried that jump.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I can imagine an experienced Warlock telling his/her story, a couple of kinderguardians sitting around listening intensely. "Desperate times call for desperate measures... and so I jumped..."
---
We heard your request, so now we're bringing back hawkmoon and thorn. Oh yeah, and fusion rifles now damage the user
---
https://youtu.be/QEzhxP-pdos
---
Yeah only a couple years late hahaha 
---
Not being rude but I honestly don't care enough to respond properly. You apparently know everything so not going to bother.
---
Wonder why it was so late?
---
I think it should be like that, although nothing has been confirmed so nobody knows if like last time, only the new season starts on the 5th and the DLC drops a week after, or if we're getting the DLC on the 5th as well.
---
I know. Thats how i want it.
---
0/10 doesn‚Äôt shine with the light of a thousand suns and blinds me like it does in game
---
Hammerhead works wonders.
---
Did you beat the other 2 DLC?
---
 Post about three max light characters #43566. 
---
After dark below and house of wolves dry spells I didn't think I'd come back, I did. After d2 until forsaken I knew I wasn't coming back, I did. If bungie can do anything they can always drag me back no matter how much I think they've killed the game. 
---
All kinderguardians must learn the pain of a queenbreaker sooner or later

It's actually called that now. "Heavy ammo finder." So no.

[pfft, Titan. obviously...](https://youtu.be/IN9LUlj2HN0)

Thanks, next time I‚Äôll watermark memes üòâ

I was trying to stop the dude from banking the motes. I saw he was bee-lining right for the bank and I was trying to stop him

Brutus uses Skullfort
---
the swing one too 
---
Now there's a teachable moment. And now i know how to use the search bar. Thank you. If you just try and teach people rather than calling out someone who doesn't even know, we'll build a better community.
---
Btw, I've searched just now and it only showed me low or 0 upvoted posts about this
---
is this a picture for thralls?
---
I've looked at a few of the websites for "LFG" and it seems quite a few people are looking for experienced runs only haha.... gonna be rough for new players it seems
---
Not for long. Just a week and it‚Äôs getting it‚Äôs easy ass aiming ability NERFED. 
---
‚ÄúBack in my day, queenbreaker has a second word in its name‚Äù
---
Congrats, triple infamy next week will be your friend. Meanwhile I'm struggling with light vs light at 6/10
---
From far away.  Yep. Your right.  But from mid to the beginning  of the long range distance a thunderlord with a simple strafe maneuver will make short work of it.  
---
I think it depends which place you look. On the giant discord server for PC players to find each other, it's only common to see "experienced only" for the newest raid. The longer the raids are out, the more laid back people seem to get. There is a subreddit, /r/destinysherpa, where people post to teach new raiders in particular. 
---
Did you do it on all three characters, I got each item on my last try of the activity on my third character
---
booooo
---
I haven‚Äôt tried that yet. I barely play my secondary so I just noticed it the other day 
---
you DARE step in Cayde's shadow?!
---
still yet to get it, not because of RNG, but lack of raid teams :(
---
I've been praying to him for the last 5 weeks to drop me "Always on Time" &amp; Anarchy. Even made a second character for it.
---
So if I don't do raids, then I'd be crippling myself :(
---
So for raids I'd have to find groups in lfg sites eh?
---
Just look for a clan, they're the best thing you're gonna get to consistent raid teams. My clan team has outlawed me and says any use of the gun is a flex on everyone else
---
I know the feeling man, got one left on Titan.
---
Fucking loved that movie.
---
I dont think its smart to abandon teammates when theres still a bunch of enemies around.
---
both
---
F
---
There is no energy-type matching in PvP anymore but other then that, nice idea.
---
raids are pretty important and fun, and are a massive part of the pve endgame, so you would really be crippling yourself by not doing them. i am a solo player, yet i still manage to gets my raids done thanks to the pc lfg discord. it takes a bit to find a teaching group, but imo it‚Äôs worth it.
---
Through Fire and Flood isn't a Gambit weapon.

Ahh thank you! 
---
Those damn Phalanx's. What class and loadout did you use ? I still need to run this solo at some point to get that triumph.
---
Oof a bit skeptical now since tgis game came out quite awhile ago right
---
Doing well. Thanks for asking.

I agree. A pretty bland pointless character in general. I'd rather see them make a clan hall or something. 
---
Don't we all..
---
You just don‚Äôt quit, do you?
---
Well if anyone knows the crucible it's you 
---
I'm rockin the gambit chrome Saint-14 look right now.
---
Wow dude. You surely reached all the way that your stubby arms could for that one. Its text you cant tell emotion behind anything. I can say anything I want with a smile on my face. So keep reaching. I'm sure daddy will let you have his bottle in your mouth soon.
---
I didn't say they shouldn't be allowed just, comp is there for a reason, quickplay is also there for a reason
---
I once solo blade barraged my own best friend once, I ended up on the enemy team when I joined his game mid way
---
Every Warlock but us floats. Big dumb.
---
How? Even with the backup plan proc and charge time mw, it should be the same if not slightly slower right?
---
Nice, 12/10 would do if I had friends
---
dambbbbb. daaaaaaaaammmb.
---
have you tried a console after being on pc a while
---
thats the reason they need aim assist
---
I wouldn't reccomend it because now I don't have any friends either
---
Full inventory...
---
Well done! I've been trying to do that for a long time now but no luck, its the only thing i need for the title
---
To  you as well my Fellow Guardian
---
Same my dude took me 9 tries to get this..
---
"The Crucible is no place for mercy!" Lord Shaxx
---
Nope it was near empty
---
Every slot? If so, then idk what to say
---
I had to record my tv on my phone cause I can‚Äôt exactly upload vids from Xbox straight to Reddit. And my inventory was empty 
---
Yeah I‚Äôm trying to work on my Hunter who is now a 150 
---
I‚Äôve watched it happen with skins and heads in other games I‚Äôve seen loot disappear and then take time to become available again so it‚Äôs a legitimate concern I‚Äôm new to the destiny franchise and not sure how much they like to hit your hip pocket
---
Thanks. Don't think I have even seen the "tower" yet and I never went back to the Farm after I first found it! Now I see it is good for something. 
---
"If" its the operative word my friend. There is no if on shoulder charges, you can kill an opponent in a 180 degree charge. Warlocks may be excelling at pve  but at pvp its a different story.
---
If I remember correctly you can keep stuff in vault and it counts. 
---
Thanks, now what I was seeing makes perfect sense. 
---
Until I get some more phat lewt I guess I will have to avoid 1-on-1s and pick off the injured players. 
---
What's funny is how late this meme is...but i literally said this today after not speaking spiders name in like 6 months give or take.soo the timing is odd..
---
Not that I'm complaining, but this is new to D2 right? I never saw patch notes about it.
---
Some info about the title. I play(ed) an MMO called Mabinogi, where you could get a BUNCH of materials or currency from a single kill/gather. Between 3x and 23x the amount of normal amounts, they are called Lucky/Huge Lucky Finishes.
---
I thought this was pretty neat.
---
When No-Light-November is finally over.
---
No. I started playing Black Friday 2018 and the only thing I haven‚Äôt done are the raids. But, I haven‚Äôt really tried to raid. 
---
i want to be able to do things in bigger stacks. because who tf thought it was a good idea that you can only dismantle 1 shader at a time or turn in 10/20/25 mats to vendors per click. how hard is it to implement a system where you can input the amount you want and just go. half my postmaster is filled with blue shaders because i'm not going to spend the next 20 minutes slowly dismantling blue geometries or any of the other worthless shaders i will never use
---
By the way, you can also use [Ishtar Commander for Android or Apple](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.unintuitive.IshtarCommander&amp;hl=en_AU) or [Destiny Item Manager for a computer](https://destinyitemmanager.com/) to use the vault while doing missions or exploring. Super useful since you don't need to fly to the farm or whatever every single time you want to equip a different weapon (you'll get to a point where you have more than you can fit in your inventory)
---
The raids aren't super necessary to play the game but they're a big part and pretty fun. I used to raid non-stop back in Destiny 1 but I haven't even touched the two newest ones since they came out. Their main use was getting higher light gear but now there are tons of different ways to do that and they aren't necessary. The good stuff from them is the armour and weapons that only drop from the raid and the special exotics that have a super low chance of dropping each time you finish one.
---
I think its a cool loadout and I'm glad to see a sword getting some use. A couple of questions tho. 
---
1. which subclass path are you using
---
2. how would this load out deal with something like a shotgun
---
3. how the fuck u get that armour because its badass
---
If you get a good role on a Retold Tale(Dreaming City shotgun) it is pretty good. Otherwise grinding out The Loaded Question is good, it can one shot a gambit invader when the mag is full at close range :)
---
Also, the Trust handcannon is a very good weapon
---
Hey man, if you happen to be using Xbox, feel free to add me johnnyxftw, I don‚Äôt mind helping you out! 
---
What‚Äôs some good perks for it bro? And I‚Äôm currently grinding the loaded question out now and I dismantled my masterwork trust on accident :(
---
Scout rifles did just get a buff in the crucible 
---
Again as I said not in this franchise other game franchises I‚Äôve experiences this hence asking as I said I‚Äôm new to this game franchise and not familiar with how they conduct business 
---
I have slideshot(reloads+increased range on a slide) and auto-loading on it, and also have a range masterwork. These perks work for me as it keeps ammo in the mag and gives it some hella good range when you slide.
---
Any dreaming city energy: retold tale, waking vigil, twilight oath. Any Ikelos weapon also really, Shotty, Sniper, SMG (Which also is hella fun in things like gambit). Trust is also good. For a more rifle sort of thing maybe the Kibou/Right Side of Wrong one a Arc Auto the other a Solar Pulse. I heard the Erentil Fusion is good as it one shots in Crucible. I also personally love Vestian Dynasty (a sidearm) with Targeting Adjuster and Stability Masterwork, packs a hell of a punch for what it is. 
---
Got the shotty on my second clear during the shotgun only week. 1K is still elusive as ever though.
---
But if you have one of the same class you can also share armor and thats make its a lot easier to get to 600+
---
You start at a good time. Launch was a bit rough. There is a ton of content right now. Try to find friends/join a clan by the time you end the forsaken campaign, as to do the end game stuff you'll need those. But the game is in a great state right now, at least for PvE.
---
Reaching max light level is time gated. It takes a long time regardless of if you play all day or 1hour a day. You will take long to catch up regardless. It's just part of the game, trying to reach max light level. Not necessarily the most compelling part but everybody went through it.

Thank you!

https://app.destinyitemmanager.com this web app can be used to remotley manage your vault and is a life saver. I highly recomend using it.
---
Warlock. Best jump in the game.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs very good and quite easy to use.

Happened to me while killing some random goblin in a lost sector
---
Sorry can't it's my only one
---
Shaham on suicide watch.

So you cleared adds. One guy invaded. And the other 2 guys kinda just showed up?
---
Waking Vigil, Dreaming City Hand Cannon.
---
Correct. 
---
"Decent" super lel as if all hunter supers arent ridiculously powerful in PvP and PvE
---
Yeah the kinetic slot is becoming tougher and tougher but i love this thing. And rapid fires are getting nerfed i believe next wk
---
nearly 700 hours played and still having fun
---
Relish the time brother
---
The update should be in thread, I GOT THE QUEST STEP! And ended on a strong 11.0 on a countdown match. Doing next step when I get home from work
---
Unfortunately I'm on xbox, but I appreciate your offer. One more reason I love this game. We really do have the best community. 
---
Nah Jabba is kinda pretty much evil. Spider isn't totally evil. Actually I really don't think he's evil, he's just not a hero either. 
---
Just saying that is very easy to use Nova Warp and instantly regain Super and allow your team mates to collect 15 motes
---
yea I changed it up to the best of my ability for nearly max range but crap reload speed and handling
---
Keep grinsing for a better roll.. +26 frames got me 3 godrolls
---
Crucible isn't a simulation to my knowledge, guardians are actually killing each other over and over again to become stronger.
---
Only 4313 tries to get a &gt;95% chance on getting your perfect roll at least once.
---
*What a deal!*
---
But in gambit, youre actually killing someone with the intent to kill them
---
Killing a guardian in their super counts as breaking elemental shields. So for this specific description, using a solar weapon to kill a golden gun will activate the perk
---
It's on the [official roadmap](https://1images.cgames.de/images/gamestar/279/destiny-2-roadmap-deutsch_6051410.jpg).
---
That actually freaking worked. 500 kills for the catalyst. Why TF doesn‚Äôt it say that in game? Why only on that app? Why AT ALL on the app? So dumb
---
[Me every time I invade with Thunderlord and a full super](https://i.redd.it/0edx7rgzv3f11.png)
---
Forsaken exotics please and thank you 
---
If you reach max rank in valor (non-competitive crucible) or infamy (gambit), you can reset your rank back to the start again. It gives you triumphs, emblems and a few other specific things for some quests and stuff.
---
And yep, you reach infamy reset at 15000, as soon as you max out legend 
---
Yeah. I don‚Äôt think they play destiny much the match took forever. 
---
Oh I'm happy with it. There's just that knowledge in the back of my mind that tells me it's not really him and I get sad Haha
---
Did phalanx dropped down and then teleported behind you? Cause that‚Äôs how I lost my flawless
---
Oh 150 is still a great round ! Lot harder to get high kills these days with people obtaining the breakneck 
---
Oh I know! I'm just saying they get assist to help level the playing field. Shit, I've played cross-platform PvP before (Gears 4) and those console folks raped me!
---
Yep. Knocked him off and assumed he'd die. Oh how wrong I was.
---
Good point.
---
I feel your pain brother
---
If You like fusion rifles you‚Äôll love it! Pretty slow firing but packs a punch and if you can sweep shot red bar ads it can make things disappear fast üòä
---
Superior pve class. Can‚Äôt put these numbers up with a titan or hunter üòè

Damn right boi

I did some statistics recently so that part was easy but then I still needed to solve x, which is easy enough if you do it regularly but I hadn't done that in a couple of years. 
---
"CHICKEN CHASER" - Some farm guy probably
---
Drifter is a Risen, (That is, he has a Ghost, comes back from the dead, etc.) He is not a "Guardian" as he does not answer to Zavala/Ikora/Cayde what have you. It's possible that he is a "Shadow of Yor" which is basically a Guardian gone bad, who follows the teachings of the Guardian turned bad Dredgen Yor. The jury is still out on wether or not he's actually a follower of Yor, or just pretending. He has a couple lore books explaining that he is in contact with Shin Malphur, the guy who actually killed Dredgen Yor. The exact nature of their relationship will be explained (most likely) in the second season of the annual pass. If you go to this link, [https://www.ishtar-collective.net/categories/shin-malphur](https://www.ishtar-collective.net/categories/shin-malphur) and this link [https://www.ishtar-collective.net/categories/dredgen-yor?highlight=dredgen](https://www.ishtar-collective.net/categories/dredgen-yor?highlight=dredgen) this link [https://www.ishtar-collective.net/categories/book-a-drifters-gambit](https://www.ishtar-collective.net/categories/book-a-drifters-gambit) and this link [https://www.ishtar-collective.net/search/drifter](https://www.ishtar-collective.net/search/drifter) 
---
you should be able to find most if not all of the lore surrounding this story. 
---
Petra was there for a while 
---
https://www.ishtar-collective.net/search/drifter/page/1?document_type_id=2 He's got quite a history, and one hell of a story. He's like Guardians, but he doesn't go by that classification, he's deemed a Lightbearer instead since he only Guards his own life. Has a Ghost though, and some history with Shin Malphur.
---
ü§£ü§£ü§£üêî
---
Crimil's Dagger is an excellent choice too! I'd say definitely this one over the other, rampage is not really gonna help for bows since it does not change shots to kill and explosive arrows are cool but deal less critical damage. You want to deal as much headshot damage as possible so that your CD can finish the kill off more easily. Maybe even a body shot is enough after that; at the very least a headshot will 100% do it.
---
Link to this stat? I actually don't double it lol.
---
I mean there‚Äôs no way to tell that OP didn‚Äôt do something and isn‚Äôt telling us 
---
Doesnt one of TTF's rockets supress? Aka makes people get out of their super? So it would be counter productiv like a hunter using tether to get light v light XD idk how ttf works tho
---
It's the Thorium Holt Robes
---
Seems like an hour full of reading, guess I know what I'll be doing 
---
So he doesnt have any of those powers like golden gun and such? 
---
The masterworked NoB is amazing and I‚Äôll use it for all time probably 
---
This. The odds that OP was banned for no reason at all are pretty slim.
---
That's dope.
---
Welp, gotta nerf hunters.
---
OP is talking about Forsaken, which has been out since September and has received many reviews, most of which are very positive. 
---
The best be getting the hell back I want my loot 
---
Thanks for the link! I hadn't considered using Xur as a cheap numbers boost but that's a great idea.
---
Blanca?
---
Like a Valhalla for guardians? With Cayde and Saint 14 hanging out?
---
Cayde in the back, "I'm still here" üò¨üòîüò≠
---
Would be nice if you could skip the campaign though and level from just playing the multiplayer part.
---
That would be great. Bonus points for playing objective, sometimes that is kills, sometimes control points etc...
---
yup
---
Oh I didn't knew that, thanks for the advice! Unfortunately I'm on Xbox One so we can't play together but I'll ask my clan if they can help out! 
---
Oh bows are easily one of my top three favorite weapon types. They did a great job with the. In this game. 
---
It seems Fable still lives on....
---
Wait i had no idea spectral blade gave them the ability to see players through walls and shit. thats insane. The downside you mentioned- weak nades isnt really that bad of a con. I used my warlock sticky grenade, stuck someone in the face and they lived through it, so nades in general are pretty bad as far as i see.
---
Id say dodge is perceived as being overpowered due to the map pool. Usually if i play on a map that has some longer sight ranges, the game starts seeming balanced. but generally speaking the majority of the maps are close quarters, and getting to the next room is one dodge away for any hunter, and theres very little anyone can do to stop someone in spectral dagger at those close quarters.
---
Dude, blink. And burst glide just does parabolic arcs, I'm a technician with both of them.
---
I know that feel, I did all challenges and throne everytime on three characters, nothing. But today, after not playing for a while, I got them both. RNG will bless you, too. Be patient and take some strength from me! 
---
Maybe my rng was just so good that they thought " man this guy must be cheating he got OEM/two tailed fox and dredgen in the same night. Must be hacking"
---
Quit torturing The Colonel! If Cayde were there he would be very angry!
---
I have the one in the southern EDZ near the Bergusia forge. Never gonna open it.
---
YOU MONSTER!!! Leave the colonels wife alone!!! 
---
But what fusion was that? Almost looks like the EP smg..
---
Erentil FR4. My baby
---
To feel that much time and effort just to be deteled.  Feels bad man, Im a dad of 2 so I rarely get time to play so it puts into perspective how much time I actually have put into it.
---
Insult to injury I can still go on my destiny 2 app, view my characters and move equipment around on them.
---
really....is ....no one gonna say it......sigh.....alright! LOOK HIS PLAYING WITH HIS CO...we interrupt this program due to technically difficulties. 
---
Was doing competitive with a friend who was much further in that quest than I was. When it popped up in the feed " (user) has found depression and loneliness" I lost it. Idk why it was so funny to me but it was 
---
A few changes. 
---
Sentinel got their super damage on the heavy attack at the end of a melee combo increased. Nothing much has changed. Commander sentinel is my go to for Titan. 
---
Middle tree sunbreaker had some improvements but generally still prefer top tree for melting point. 
---
Bottom tree striker got a major overhaul and is now an add clear monster. The R1 shoulder charge in super had its energy cost heavily reduced and the super regens energy more often on kills so you can just spam the R1 on adds and it keeps going as long as you keep killing. It‚Äôs impressive add clear really. Have seen a video of someone killing every enemy in the whisper mission up to the boss room with a single super. 
---
Fair enough, but I checked out OP on destinytracker.
---
Definitely not a bad player, he holds his own. But he's a ways off top 1%. If I was a betting guy, I'd say someone in the worlds top 1% holds the record.
---
If you've seen someone with a kd of 10.00 and dozens of infamy resets play the game then you would probably also bet someone else out there, in the top 1%, holds the record.
---
That said, I'm not trying to say he's bad or it wasn't a very good session. Simply that world records are a very hard thing to claim. I'm impressed yes, but I just don't believe it's a world record. 
---
I agree with it being B.S, but I really feel like even if I did somehow convince bungie to investigate, they wouldnt over turn their decision. I just feel like this happens more than we hear about, and I cant stand company's that bad without reason. If your going to ban my account, at the very least give me a reason om why.
---
If I was that enemy I'd be so mad hahah
---
Drop those motes, and I‚Äôll make you drip, sister 
---
You need a pic of me holding the A button &amp; nothing happens? 
---
Nice shot, man. Charge time was non-existent.

Back up plan is a hell of a drug

Bruuuh mind blown

oh shit, annual pass only? damn that kinda sucks

I think use plastidip's product is an easy way, it's called [Hypershift](https://www.dipyourcar.com/collections/hypershift-pearls) but it's really costly I think you can DIY it for [cheaper cost.](https://youtu.be/-SbBoMK-1bQ)

That is some mystical lore right there

you could also watch/listen to the videos of MyNameIsByf. He's the grandmaster of Destiny lore videos and puts out fantastic contect. he made a 3 part video about the drifter and a video about Shin Malphur, Dredgen Yor and their weapons that goes on for about 1,5 hours. Again, absolutely worth watching!
---
I like it. Ive been wanting one like that for so long but i cant afford a real replica. How did you make it. Im no good at stuff like that but id take a crack at it lol
---
My friend was banned but I never knew why, he said it must by lag because his net is really bad, but who knows. 
---
Try a blade barrage, solocasted nova bomb, panic slam, or shoulder charge instead of dawnblade, then I can agree
---
Are we PC players or console?
---
Lmao considering all the awfully inappropriate jokes my friends and I have made about animal sex (chickens were one of the animals we used most commonly) this is hilarious and sad at the same time. Poor colonel will be a widow soon haha
---
'Poochoo wassa neena glimmer, Guardian? Hoohoohoo!
---
I was that guy until roughly a month ago, and can sum up exactly why in two words: Fuck Activision.
---
I literally only just got Destiny 2 a few days ago expressly because Bungie divorced Activison and took Destiny with them. Me buying it was my statement to Activision, *"Thanks. Now kindly, fuck off."* Buying all of the Destiny 2 content *after* Activision and Bungie split, feels like the best ~$28 I've spent in recent memory. I literally cheered and danced.
---
After Activision fucked me over so royally with the original Destiny, I did everything I could to ensure they never saw another dime from me. Even figured out how to get the entire collection of original Destiny DLC from a GameStop pre-owned copy of the Taken King Collection version to ensure Activision was totally cut-out of the sale, literally the day after it released at retail.
---
I always loved Bungie, much as I have always loved BioWare. Their massive anti-consumer publishers however are cancers that must be cut out and incinerated. I voted with my wallet, and it seems that enough other people have that Activision is crumbling. The best thing Activision could have ever done to strengthen the Destiny IP for years to come, was to go away and find a nice quiet corner the company to die in.
---
I must say, I'm genuinely enjoying Destiny 2, and it's developers at Bungie should be very proud of it, despite the clear and obvious marks of Activision has left on it's monetized design elements *(such as the Eververse and Silver system)*. Sure, there's some design side issues here and there that are almost certainly Bungie's fault, but those can be learned from and improved upon in the future.
---
From here on out, I'm buying everything Bungie wants to self-publish. It feels like finally coming back home after Mom finally divorced that abusive piece of shit excuse for a step-dad.
---
If anyone would like to make a Breakneck, I would like to see it
---
Honestly I find it really crap.
---
Takes far too long to kill something get get its perks proc'd.
---
Doomfangs for Sentinel, makes it last a lot longer. Synthoceps are also very good. If you like the shoulder charge builds, Dunemarchers might be a good pick too.
---
I knew the Almighty was feeding off Mercury but never actually looked for it! Cool post, thanks OP :D
---
The first time I heard about gambit, I thought both teams would be on the same map at the same time (rather than invading). I think it'd be interesting to see how that concept plays out: you could have larger maps that allow you to kill adds and get motes, while still being able to engage your opponents at will. Then you'd have to balance killing enemies with fighting the opposing team and form strategies around that.
---
Fucking yes! I would sit all the time if it was this
---
So, I got an SSD for like $70 and it is insane how much faster everything got for me. The only thing on the drive is Destiny 2, so that may help. It‚Äôs just amazing how much this sped up the game and loading screens for me. 
---
Just use the destiny 2 companion I got all of my seals and the prestige completion for the catalyst done in a day on there :) good luck guardian!
---
Missed my melee? i played it in slow mo so many times. Maybe on the server it was a "miss" but it sure as hell wasnt a miss.
---
I've mained a Hunter since D1. I alt a Warlock. Couple things... Arcstrider is fine. Don't forget the new ability is a shield, it's an active defense that drains the super. 
---
I picked my Warlock back up after the Nova buff and I'm waltzing through iron banner. I'm not really sure what part you feel is underpowered, I think they're in a good place right now.
---
You‚Äôre right about arcstrider. I use the top tree for nova bomb and aside from people actually outrunning my nova bomb, it‚Äôs good now but situational. 
---
Nice, I‚Äôm waiting for my wayfarer to get here tonight
---
Was that your first completion for the week or something?
---
What is this referring to? Do custom games count? Or are you giving your account to another person?
---
What shotgun?
---
anything is better than a stale meta though, like shotguns have been a blast but it's time for something else to be cool
---
They called him Dredgen Yor
---
There was also the exotic class items for getting the TTK collectors edition. The hunter one was ass the warlock was cool but by far the titan one was dope asf. 
---
It was a mark with a fukin hammer of sol attached to the side. It was so dope
---
If Thorn is coming back as a scout rifle...they need to fix scout rifles. The only time I use them is in Pvp.
---
i just started playing too after getting...discouraged by Anthem after a week.  i was thinking about buying it but it just let me install it for free out of battle.net when i opened it so that was cool.  
---
the graphics aren't as good as anthem, but still really good and the environments are much more varied.  the guns feel great for the most part.  i like the auto rifle and the shotgun most so far.  the music is also awesome.  right when the music starts building up i know something cool is about to happen.  the story is pretty dumb, but i like the Cayde.  it should keep me occupied for a while.  
---
my favorite planet! very cool.
---
No worries. I go have a big library of games that I am always cycling between, so I may or may not be on too.
---
Referring to people paying for someone to recover their account and then uses sketchy options like DDOSing or win trading with booster accounts to get the main account to Legend rank.
---
I didn't get to use it before the nerf, so I'm not certain of everything it had. I do know that a direct hit with a blade barrage wasn't a guaranteed kill on a Nova Warp user though so... It definitely needed a nerf. But, that's another issue, PvP vs PvE. In PvE, go wild. If it's stupid op and you just like blowing aliens to hell, you should be able to. The PvP side becomes unbalanced though, and then everyone gets mad at some aspect. I'd almost prefer a list where supers are disabled, or only the basic trees are useable. 
---
I use it because of the melee, so I hit them with two bullets of last word then melee and I have karnstein armelts equipped so I automatically get the buff from it amazing in comp for slaying lol
---
Had one where the guy would grab 15 motes and kill himself every single time in order to sabotage us.
---
Another where it was me and a fireteam of three on my side. Even though I was getting Army of One medals every time I invaded, the moment I jumped into the portal, they would repeatedly kill themselves until I got back because they wanted to invade. So I let them twice...one kill on one of them and no kills on the second. So, I just ate the loss and chalked it up to being another shi\* team I had to breastfeed on Gambit again.
---
Amen, brother
---
If you think that you are a fool. The new aim bots use overlays. There is always a way to cheat. Games just have to keep up with them 
---
As somebody who has Luna's, it isn't as good as you think. I get outranged by Ace of Spades all the time. Not to mention that if you can't consistently nail those headshots, you might as well be using a Trust.
---
Moon of Saturn
---
Currently inaccessible, but it‚Äôs revealed
---
Sure. Unique in appearance. 10% subclass xp was hardly anything to phone home about though. Design them like other exotic armour pieces in function and fashion. Not just fashion. 
---
Tap it in, just tap it in.
---
Look! Sometimes you're just *that* good you intimidate the enemy team into disconnecting before the game even starts!  ^32 ^^times ^^^in ^^^^a ^^^^^row
---
I don't get it... I assume this is in reference to a meme?
---
You know it also had perks like other class items too and could be re rolled via glass needles. If they made it like real exotics it‚Äôd be broken having 2 exotic armor pieces
---
Don't tell me what to do!
---
No, you did Nova Warp and you're grounded for the rest of the season. I'm sorry Warlocks but it's the only way you will learn.
---
The fact that i lunge at him and stab him in the face with a inch of hp, then turn around because i know he should be dead. So many players get rewarded for things they shouldn't have. Shit happens all the time to me, ill get melee'd twice and take no dmg then i just shotgun him. Game is so inconsistent but so rewarding when it should. I agree, as someone who's played a hunter since D1 i know your pain my friend

---
A really good sniper to use is the long shadow you can get it from Hawthorne engrams and it can come with rampage like mine. Also if you use tractor cannon use chaos reach it has more dps than nova bomb
---
Perks that any other legendary had as well. 
---
If they designed them as actual exotics, they wouldn‚Äôt have the life exotic perk to be able to equip another. 
---
That‚Äôs the problem I don‚Äôt have any vanguard tokens and no good primary snipers
---
I don't play Destiny and haven't seen this gun before, but just wanted to say it looks really cool and well done! Nice job!
---
Also the reason for the emoting at the end is so I could get this sweet pic
---

---
You should get a stencil for the Ace of Spades
---
Agreed.
---
Damn hostile.
---
But the auto rifle is good, i would like to have it on my warlock as well :)  Do you know is there a limit to when i can get the reward? Does the quest expire after the season ends?
---
[] Investigate the worn out wiper blade
---
WAIT RYAN THIS WAS YOU?!
---
Looks like a 3D printed one, painted.
---
The model looks great, Maybe just some practice on paper or drafting for the drawings and coloring otherwise it looks incredible
---
Okay I see your point there.  Let's see how things go with Destiny now. 
---
So. A month and a half later. 
---
Anthem bombed both critically, and commercially. Selling only 10% of what Destiny did in it's first week, and 25% of what Destiny 2 did. Also did only half of what Mass Effect Andromeda sold in its first week.
---
So to sum up, you made a bunch of baseless, factless assumptions with no idea what you're talking about, and obviously you were wrong. So much for:
---
&gt; ea just showed us how easy it to make a cool looter shooter game (anthem), wasnt really hard for them, they just took a good studio and made a new game. 
---
As long as you have the quest active in your inventory, it will carry over through the seasons!
---
I care about the quest  as much as I care about your opinions. Move along and grow up now, child. Your whining has gotten old.
---
Well first let me say no one in scrims/tourneys snipe because it's literally just making you as a player useless to your team in 95% of scenarios so it's irrelevant to bring up.
---
Let me also state when I said high level I meant tourneys/scrims because yes in quickplay shotguns are basically skill less.
---
But if you wanna bring it up, Do you understand the movement shotgunning requires when playing against good players? Because it's not just run in a straight line and shotgun them. If I were to 1v1 someone who doesn't use shotguns they would not be able to kill me once because I actually know how to play with shotguns and they just think it's some braindead tactic to get a high K/D with when it's not.
---
I'm a PC player btw so if you are on console then I have no idea how it works but frankly trying to play anything competitive on console is a waste of time because of the limitations of the hardware software and controllers. 
---
If everyone around you is bad all the time, you're the one who's bad. You're probably the one dragging other people down tbh
---
You only need like a 35% win rate to get 2100 points over a season. You aren't fooling anyone
---
Thank you I‚Äôm trying this right now. What happens if I die at the start? Whenever I load back in, it puts me outside and not in the dark room where you spawn because I‚Äôm trying to do this flawlessly 
---
That's great, now go cry somewhere else, kid.
---
\&gt; Move along and grow up now, child  
---
Oh boy ya really put me in my place there wise one, projecting?
---
To sum up any and all of his videos referring to destiny or anything at that ‚Äú this game bad me no like because me think it‚Äôs stupid my iq is higher then anyone else if you disagree with me your stupid and sheep‚Äù he‚Äôs a rage channel and will do anything for a reaction and views
---
You guys are wearing the same hat
---
Ok I keep seeing people have these boxes?? Where are they getting them.  I‚Äô understand it‚Äôs for completing the  one of the major triumphs. I‚Äôm asking since my hubby got Dregden before the Black Armory drooped and as far as I know I‚Äôve seen nothing about him being sent one of these or being able to order one.  
---
Hmm. What do you mean, the dark room? The final boss arena?
---
If you die at the start, you'll have to kill the boss to reset the dungeon and then start from the very beginning, unfortunately. But in all honesty, if you have some familiarity with the Dul fight, it's *miles* easier than Vorgeth flawless.
---
Not at all. I just want teammates who are as good or better. I shouldn't be topping every scoreboard. Thanks for the useless and unhelpful input though. Did a great job at looking like an ass. üëç
---
As long as you can take your bitching elsewhere bud
---
What's next, are you going to say the sun was in your eyes?
---
There are two ways to get mods. One is to have items randomly drop with a mod on them. Dismantling the item gives you the mod. The other is to buy them from Banshee-44 with mod compoments (come from dismantling mods, or rarely from dismantling items). Banshee sells two different mods every day. 
---
Only one looking like an ass is the one that claims they are better than all their teammates and it's all their fault, you probably aren't nearly as good as you think you are. Link your destiny tracker if you want anyone to believe you, but at this point idk if anyone would even believe you unless you were logged in. 
---
Nope. Just trying to get the random loser on the internet to realize I don't care about their opinions, especially when they are completely unhelpful. 
---
But, somehow I'm just too good at crucible?
---
Yeah, grow up kid
---
Welcome to the community and great job leveling up all 3! Lots of new players like to stick with one character but I think it‚Äôs important to play all 3 at some point to get the most out of the game.
---
Thanks Bungie for banning people who cheat.
---
Pretty much everyone of these end up being cheaters or cheater associates
---
Lmao you're probably 20 and projecting, accept that you aren't as good as you think you are and you might make some progress.
---
You're the one bitching.
---
Bitching and assuming. You must be a female. 
---
Lmao rekt, this dude is hilarious
---
same here but somehow get headshot by a random queenbreaker
---
So you have to buy it from the bungie store,  it the only way to purchase it is by having completed the associated triumph. The bungie store will walk you through the purchasing process. If I remember correctly I spent like 32,  but that was with 2 day shipping üòÅ
---
You literally just unironically said, "I know you are but what am I?"
---
That‚Äôs some pretty good luck in the top right of your screen. Looks like RNGesus likes you. 
---
Wish you could rename weapons. Guess what I would rename this to...
---
It's fun. Personally I don't touch crimson much b/c I like to play at range, but it's real good for kill cleanup
---
The glory matchmaking should be determined by the highest glory on each team. There should be an influx of players playing comp once the season resets. You just are playing at the end of the season when people have already grinded Luna's and have stopped playing. Consequently, the comp player base is much smaller right now. Imo at least. The only thing that resets is your glory. The quest steps keep their progress
---
I won't boot anyone from my team regardless of how many motes lost he is a great player and indivual we hang out for fun not to play professional if wanted to play serious in and in a team that cares only for the game I would but I enjoy hanging out with friends and family and no matter who has a bad game would never boot them cause I'm.not that type of human being which I can't say for you 
---
Fuck that, you did great OP 
---
I agree but warlock is a decent class its definitely not the best if you can use it correctly its damn good. The rift is very situational. People usually put half of the around a corner and peek then clean or heal while dodging. The barricade is really only good for getting away. It doesn't stop super and most of the time when I put a barricade down it gets destroyed pretty fast. The hover throwz people off a good amount and if you got good aim that a couple shots you can sink in before they even shoot you. If you have wings of sacred dawn and bottom tree dawn blade you can hover then hold b, square or whatever the crouch button is on your system and you heal. The higher you are the better heal. The top tree dawn blade has midair dodge. And its either top or bottom tree its blades seek the target which helps with it explosive impact. For voidwalker i believe top tree you can charge nades. Charge about axion bolt itll seek teh target and leave them 1 shot. If you use the dlc stormcaller class you can DESTROY super and opponents as well as get some super back if you cut it off quick. I get what your saying and I mean no disrespect. It's a harder class to use depending on how you play. Its definitely a fun class and currently the one I've been using most.
---
I ordered mine on February 9th and still have not received it. Wondering if anyone can tell me how long it took to recieve after they ordered it?
---
For those wanting to know, they were Knuclehead Radar and Lucky Pants
---
That looks great! You should try one of the escalation protocol weapons, those are cool.
---
Yeah. I could see that for sure. I have the catalyst for it. So excited to try it out. 
---
Yeah, I've pretty much given up for now. Maybe I'll give it a shot after the reset.
---
Mine came to $28.62 with standard shipping.
