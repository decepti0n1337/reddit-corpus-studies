Arcstrider is so good in just about every way, but... I miss my knife.

---
---
You will have to buy forsaken if you want to do the story, but you wont have to do it; you can just jump into shadowkeep instead.
---
The giant plant reminds me of that rick moranis movie little shop of horrors!!!
---
ok i just had a dum moment
---
Woah!  Well done!
---
still
---
Sorry our abilities and supers and damage are just betterüëäüèªüò≥üëãüèºüòé
---
is this a personal attack or something?
---
Can we rename the Astocyte Verse and blink combo to Astro Glide?
---
it's just if you get pushed off
---
*you're ded*
---
If you really want to power grind you can do it. You may be able to get them to 750 if you do your main first, transfer your weapons over to your alts and power level on them. Although there are better ways to spend your time in this lull of content. Go for a title, Dredgen or MMXIX, maybe even Wayfarer. Grind out menagerie for some god rolls. Ultimately it's up to you.
---
can i get the files?
---
Bruh look at my flair lmao I wasn't bashing warlocks I was just stating if he was hunter or titan he would've jumped back on
---
2 days ago i did firsttime last wish as the 6th rando. after talking all the way till the second encounter, i found out my mic wasnt even working for some reason and i was talking to myself all along. ive tried to fix it everytime 1 guy explained the encounter but i didnt manage to. 4 of us were doing it for the first time but we only failed at the heart run like 10 times. not bcause i didnt have a mic or because of others failing it but rather because it was bugged af.
---
i communicated with ingame movement and spammed 55555 in chat to let them know the timer and extend it.
---

---
honestly ive never had so much fun in any videogame ever. we all had fun,shit was hilarious.
---
10/10 would break mic again
---
O you don‚Äôt have a flair my bad
---
Ohhhh okay thank youüëç
---
Never had a problem with my jump but ok
---
The charge recharges your grenades hella fast and hits multiple targets? And heals you? And will give you super energy if you happen to have hands on perk on it from when xur sold it? Will keep you from wasting special ammo on trash enemies? Duh
---
It says Warlock next to my name for me just like yours says hunter/Warlock
---
This is dope
---
I've seen this before in a school about 45 minutes out.
---
O ok it just started showing for me
---
hahahahahahaha!
---
He has 15, we need 3.   I bank the 3 because fuck him.  He missed his window.
---
oh ok, thanks for the clarification :)
---
October 1st with shadow keep and new light update, ALL destiny 2 players will have ALL of their gear automatically updated to 750 power level. So that side arm you put in the vault 2 years ago and forgot you had? 750 power just like everything else.
---
For new players starting October 1st, the gear they receive will start at 750 power level.
---
From what we can tell, this will happen each upcoming season.
---
r/fireteams or r/destinysherpa
---
Two more things: what game mode should I do it in and what subclass/tree should I use (hunter)
---
Thank you!
---
A lot of high schools do this
---
I really hope uldren becomes the vanguard
---
Sure
---
Keep up the good work man, very good work!
---
I'm pretty sure that's only on burst glide. I use strafe glide...
---
Titan: Vengeful 0:07
---
........So, do you have designated parking spaces, or are you just able to paint/decorate a random parking space when you're a senior?
---
Will I still need to buy all of the previous dlc or do I just buy this new dlc then and have the rest of the game?
---
When you're intending to fall anyways xD
---
Again I said I personally prefer strafe glide and use all the time
---
I‚Äôm confused what does warming have to do with Cayde
---
Should have done it out of Eva foam.. second OP I tell that
---
I think your good now lol
---
Nope
---
Can you tell me the gear and shaders
---
Hopefully :D I have more on my warlock, too
---
Of course one second
---
Glad you were able to get it sorted out. Sorry I couldn‚Äôt be of more assistance.

I wish blink was on every warlock sub class
---
That's awesome! In my high school parking was every man for himself, no holds barred lmao!
---
One of my most played games growing up was Halo 3 and the sense of community in that game was amazing. I remember you could play a public match and wind up having the whole lobby having fun in custom games just by messaging them!
---
Destiny is one of the first games in years to give me that same kind of sense of community.
---
I deleted for honor because I couldn‚Äôt beat the tutorial
---
Nah I appreciate the help my dude!
---
I kind of burst myself into the ground. I press x again like right after the peak of my jump and I find that I can only really get that kind of speed on a 9 or so mobility hunter.
---
I wish we were allowed to paint out spaces at my school. This looks amazing!

 Clan Name: Travelerz Chozen
---
Systems: Xbox One
---
Country/Time Zone: Mostly the US and in EST/CST
---
Play Times: The majority of members are online in the evenings and on weekends. We do have some players that play around the clock!
---
About Us: We were started by a couple of members who left a very rules-heavy clean. Our general ideology is to have a group of people available at any time to run any activity. We aren't a group that is running Petra's Run or "pwning Newbs" at Legend on a daily basis... Instead, we are a rather casual group of players that are playing to have a good time.
---
If you want a group of players to grind some Reckoning with for 1-2 hours on a Wednesday, you want to learn how to run Last Wish, or you need a couple of people to to play some lower level comp with to get your Reculse; then we are your kind of clan!
---
For context, I personally found the clan randomly through an Xbox LFG post. I was in one of those 90+ player clans where nobody played with each other. Once I joined up with these guys, I cleared my first Last Wish raid, ran through several reckoning/gambit prime runs, and have had a much better play experience!
---
Best Way to Contact Us: Send me a message! This is a reddit account specifically for our clan! I'll send the details for how you can get an invite into the clan!
---
Oh shit it‚Äôs been like 5 minutes, thanks man
---
This, this is exactly what I was about to post
---
The light is strong in you, grad of 2020
---
Thank you guardian!
---
Sounds perfect, thank you!
---
He still may, but he's here on Reddit with like-minded friends.
---
If you catch shit at school and you're still there, try not to let it bother you. You'll look back and laugh at how much high school didn't matter.
---
Doing solo matchmaking I went from 43 to 2100 in 20 hours. Some people get it in four if you just keep on winning. Others are stuck for months with nothing to show for it. 
---
If you're playing with a friend, your chances should be better. Going it alone is pretty much a toss-up every time you start a round.
---
Looks more like [Gofannon's Hammer](https://bungie.net/common/destiny2_content/icons/51d03cb2d6cba30c4020d1b4e350449a.jpg)
---
You go to the same school as the other dude in here?
---
Pretty well known gun
---
Men are simple creatures.
---
I know, but there's Cabal in this forge
---
I'm down! I'm only like 280 light on my main though, and my best weapons are the class exotics and Callus raid weapons though. I'm just coming back from a 2yr hiatus.
---
dude, I have been on a 0 to enemy team having Prime Evil spawned and our invader trolled them so hard we won. It aint over until its over
---
A'ight, thank you for the help!
---
Cabal are in Volundr
---
All Forsaken owners who don‚Äôt currently own the **year two** season pass will automatically get it on the 17th of this month. The **year three** season pass can be obtained in full if you preorder the Shadowkeep deluxe edition.
---
We've all been there
---
No. It'd be trivially easy to spam the perk in crucible.
---
Welcome to the dark realm
---
Ok
---
But this is Volundr
---
I heard If you do this with skyburner‚Äôs oath ornament the cabal become allies.
---
To add to this comment. Every kill with fighting lion drops a primary ammo brick. And if you use a lunafaction empowering rift it‚Äôll one shot people. Well of radiance has the same effect. I didn‚Äôt have militias so I used fighting lion for most of it and I got a good bit of the double kills with my trusty edge transit with high explosive ordnance.
---
Have fun killing people in their supers! :D
---
[This](https://bungie.net/common/destiny2_content/icons/c3cc89c98bdfef83ab63e2f8e82d9592.jpg) is Volundr, [this](https://bungie.net/common/destiny2_content/icons/51d03cb2d6cba30c4020d1b4e350449a.jpg) is Gofannon

Kept spelling every word in that wrong, the other sub links should work fine now man
---
No the vanguard dare is about a hunt for Taniks a  fallen captain that we killed in D1.  If you failed to kill him, you became the hunter vanguard.  The dare was between Andal Brask and Cayde on who could kill Taniks.  They both thought that Cayde had killed Taniks so Andal became the vanguard.  But later when Taniks killed Andal, Cayde realized that he actually lost the dare and took on the mantle of hunter vanguard.
---
That's your own fault for playing on one.
---
People realized how good MT/Recluse.
---
Ok I was thinking of trying to reset my valor as well
---
Yeah but wouldn‚Äôt it happen in 6 then?
---
This symbol is on the Volundr forge on the iron floor thing, I went to Volundr to take that picture, with the Cabals
---
How I feel when playing bottom tree striker in pve. And no, I run sunbreaker middle tree in PvP.
---
Post this on r/destinythegame and use the flair *bungie suggestion*
---
[removed]
---
No, people didn't know the combo and/or weren't playing the game cus season 6 sucked
---
Already a step ahead of you
---
I‚Äôll be honest I never gave it a try, Competetive‚Äôs got a hell of a reputation. I just do my own thing with autorifles anyway. Can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm very skilled in PvP.
---
PM me your GT whenever you get your cord and I'll add you!
---
It doesn't really even feel like it's even supposed to be balanced
---
But - I've found the biggest equaliser actually isn't even gear - it's hitting head shots, and being able to back off from a lost cause and regroup rather than let yourself go down to a 3 on 1.
---
Starting from 0 points, it‚Äôll be around 17 wins straight. Realistically that won‚Äôt happen so about 25 games with a few losses in between.
---
I don't know the economic position of that school, so I'm not saying it.
---
True, I actually like season 6 now after playing 150 games of gambit(used to be indifferent, thought I would hate gambit after going for mmxix but now I really like it)
---
But at the same time if it was meant to be used as a primary, theyd give it more ammo
---
What's are those weapons? I've recently started playing destiny again for the shadow keep update however even before I only had minimal time since I worked almost all day.how do I get that solar rifle
---
I am cautiously optimistic, albeit a bit scared to see the setback on a loss! Thank you for the help!
---
Ah. I do not like Gambit anymore, after playing for 15 hrs going for a spare rations (got only BTW)
---
It's fine, thanks to you, I finally realized that this symbol wasn't a Cabal symbol, but rather the Forge icon.
---
Thank you :)
---
I did it solo last week in 22 matches. If I can do it then anyone can, best of luck with it man!
---
You‚Äôre lucky you had a car at all in high school.
---
So glad they put most TTK orbit theme in Forsaken. This and The Awoken are definitely my favorites.
---
Im excited. Theres always going to be a meta. Its just a matter of what its going to be. It doesn‚Äôt really matter to me because i like practicing with everything in this game. Im particularly fond of snipers and sidearms/hc, but this shotgun/hc meta has been pretty fun too
---
It brings a completely new dimension to the game just to hear these masterpieces especially the ones we can reminisce upon
---
The no-ADS... What a madlad
---
She‚Äôs the War Priest from the Vault of Crota
---
I think its one of the Iron Banner helmets not to sure
---
How could those kids defile your parking space like that. Hunter, really? How could they? At least do something slighty bad like warlock. Don't go full trash with hunter...
---
Should have put an (f) before Allen
---
So you have chosen death
---
Calm down and go play your damn game, we‚Äôre not here trashing what you like.
---
It's so crazy that both your names are Allen
---
Quality shit man! Especially liked the cuts with the fireteams running into the opening of each raid.
---
I hate people
---
Any armour or weapons that are Pre-Forsaken can be dismantled as they can be obtained through collections
---
Any Exotics can be dismantled.
---
Any eververse item can be dismantled and would encourage doing so for bright dust.
---
Now after that you'll be left with weapons and armour that you've obtained during forsaken and beyond, dismantling them is purely dependent on their rolls which we can't see.
---
My rule is "No matter how good the roll is, if you're never gonna use it, don't keep it"
---
Imma disagree with a few. Inaugural address is still really good. Alone as a god is a decent sniper too. Midnight coup is still good if you don‚Äôt have a well rolled spare rations. Everything else can go
---
That sounds illegal.
---
In 1977 our parking lots were gravel.
---
[deleted]
---
what is it with seniors getting their own parking spaces? when did this become a thing?
---
Drive. 
---
Bring a Ford.
---
Oh my god
---
How do you not have more gunsmith materials? I feel like I have way less if most other things, and 3x the gunsmith parts.
---
but I've actually hit someone that was not even visible.
---
yeah well but you still can't use the full jump, you have to double jump pretty fast to get up with the double jump
---
I try not to get angry over shit online, But holy Fuck imagine being such a piece of shit you paint over the last thing that some people have as a memory of a friend
---
I get killed by it.
---
All. The. Time.
---
Buy an elite controller and set it up for yourself.
---
it should have been either under the bridge or on the coast to the right (facing the way OP went)
---
You may find quick play faster despite not have the 2x just due to more and lower skilled opponents for those multi kills
---
Currently ddos attacks on a couple of ISPs
---
Servitors create ether (an alternative to Light). Servitor's are ghetto ghosts change my mind
---
the dude's probably running the story mission that sends you over that bridge though
---
you still can run the raids though
---
Axion shoots two bolts normally and the last guy was killed by bloom
---
Well I guess his people need him.
---
M&amp;K on the other hand is pretty excellent
---
What is this?
---
Ah, a man of the finer tastes
---
It's called the Mark of Shame. Was branded onto Thel Vadams chest in the opening of Halo 2 before he became arbiter
---
Ah that's good.
---
I share the same pain in playing the crucible as well. Nice tat‚Äô.
---
And that's why I turned my settings to private so they CAN'T message me lol
---
Yeah I've done this prevents kill so there's that once the guy just watched me lol
---
Being nice probably pisses them off more lol
---
&gt;Have a look at the reduced super dmg resistance (unchanged) section. I get my information from bungie and actually playing the game. YOU are the wrong one here: https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48124
---
You forgot to say where you found striker titan lasting for 30 seconds normally and spectral blades for 15. 
---
&gt;You can only tell that if the titan is straight lining to me from a distance which no good player does . So that isn't practical.
---
How else do you expect them to close the distance. I've dealt with it. You probably have but were killed by it. It's common
---
&gt;From playing the game. Go play striker, observe the practical duration(super duration along with innate passive super energy return) and then go play spectral or Nova warp and observe the practical super duration (visible and using attack for mobility/ teleporting).
---
I've played striker. If I face a competent team, I get shredded. You're playing from the perspective of a hunter. I'm coming from actual experience in the class. I can tell you, all of the benefits you describe are negligible
---
&gt;Which numbers? The number of 45 second unkillable striker clips on YouTube and twitch or the community outcry for striker nerfs?
---
Didn't answer my question but sure, whatever. That's someone playing with peak performance. That's the maximum possible. It's not because striker is op it's because they're good
---
No we don‚Äôt, I promise
---
eae br, blz mano?
---
Keep it civil.
---
I heavily approve of your use of the hunter logo over titan and warlock. Hunters have been nerfed too many times while the other two classes have gotten better pvp abilities #hunternerfawareness
---
Don‚Äôt bring that on an airplane
---
The only time I didn't instagib him was during Solstice of Heros when everyone was scrambling to get their armor done. It's actually a pretty fun fight tbh.
---
Agreed
---
Dude! That's fucking sick!
---
i would probably go for shotgun cus ppl below like 3k dont know how to counter/avoid them that much
---
No... he‚Äôs, uh, fine...
---
i saw this at port huron northern, in michigan. i‚Äôve seen a couple others as well and wish more schools did it personally
---
Okay that‚Äôs fine. I was just curious as to what else was there.
---
I like to see them salt, 'I'm just like ggs, hope your games go better'. Then message them later on to see how they're doin and usually they apologize and stuff. Kinda odd how you can act in fits of frustration. I used to be the same way so I know how salt can ruin someone's gaming.
---
If you couldn't tell, games where people leave were never meant to finish.
---
Exactly. People can be very quick to compare games unfairly based on some similar characteristic. Especially with all the new content that‚Äôs been added to warframe, it itself is already a completely new game. Both great games though.
---
hunter yeet
---
There's actually a lot of content that you can do solo. When it comes to later game powerful gear farming, you may have to dip into some content with other players but it isn't 100% necessary. All in all, PvP is a very small part of the bigger game. There's only a handful of times you'd have to play PvP for an exotic quest (usually) and anytime you're soloing something but having trouble, there's plenty of ways to lfg and get a Fireteam to help
---
Yea...they all laught on Bungie
---
im fond of agreeing ditching them in the strike and searching a new one. if enough people did that then eventually the bots will get stuck in strikes with other bots and never complete
---
The season ends October 1st right?
---
That‚Äôs my pc experience this week, that and being kicked for not owning forsaken while trying to do a not forsaken thing
---
Moon's Haunted.
---
Pretty sure that's the War Lords. Might be wrong tho
---
The real W here is the catalyst drop!
---
I'm reminded of Dota's "Welcome to Dota, now fuck off"
---
Does anyone know when the Game goes F2P? I plan to come back with the cross save feature. I'm just waiting for the F2P to launch so I won't have too buy it on a 2nd platform.
---
Then we killed uldren so by vanguard dare that makes me, a titan, the new hunter vanguard. Then, I dissolve all hunters and they have to convert to warlocks or titans mwahahahahha
---

Uldren got resurrected and the screen cut to black so we don't know if we or Petra pulled the trigger on uldren

At least the repetitive parts of the first game actually still rewarded you for playing it. Any activity gave powerful gear. The problem I have is that D2 makes so many activities redundant past a certain point, you‚Äôre literally forced to play other activities and modes if you want to progress. I‚Äôm happy with the increased number of bounties and powerful gear, but you still get locked out weekly, I don‚Äôt like playing crucible or gambit or going for pinnacle weapons so after I‚Äôve obtained my weekly engrams there‚Äôs no reason for me to stay on the game, even if I wanted to play more.
---
It‚Äôs not one tiny thing though. Strike specific gear is a big one because it brought so much to the table in terms of endgame grinding. I want to look and feel powerful in game, something that D2 failed miserably at. Most of the gear in the game looks like you‚Äôve waltzed through a scrap yard and pieced together whatever you found. I get this is might what they have gone for but the armour and weapon variation in the game sucks so much, so many armour sets are reskins, and some of the best looking armour is eververse exclusive. Factions, faction bounties and rewards, the plethora of crucible modes that were available anytime. Trials, SRL, raid ornaments. Prison of elders, court of oryx, being able to grind for and equip different artefacts in Rise of Iron. Iron Banner and being able to choose what gear you want, reroll it properly, and then infuse it with a few simple legendary shards instead of half an arm and leg (enhancement cores). To have all that and be throw into D2 with a reminder of how great the game had been, angered me beyond no end. It only took them an entire year to start replacing things into the game, but for me personally it‚Äôll never be able to be as grand as D1 was. Shadowkeep looks amazing though, I think it could really set D2 above D1.
---
If Uldren actually becomes a guardian, he won‚Äôt even be Uldren he‚Äôll be a totally new person, just like all guardians are.
---
Bet there's new purple hive enemies lmao idfk
---
UwU
---
According to one character (Drifter or Shin I think), the Iron Lords were sometimes just as bad at the Warlords at putting civilians in the line of fire.
---
‚ÄòCause skeletons and purple. Everyone knows the Hive love purple. It‚Äôs the official color of Hive swag found in the gift shops on the lower deck of all Tomb Ships
---
Thought they were red ü§î
---
Gotta do intro quest first baring that pull lt on map and look for forsaken symbol
---
You're thinking of warlords - the iron lords were the first dudes who told the warlords to stop doing that
---
Wait I got it, it's hive related because its purple and they shoot purple projectiles
---
I‚Äôm switching to titan specially to run bubble
---
Update: ran it again this morning. Another double drop. 4 runs has lead to 4 double drops. Is anyone else experiencing this.?
---
Shit but then wouldnt it be cabal themed too? And vex?
---
We're working on 6 with Xavala and Ikora. Let's be honest, if it was one of them... Would we have been so hell bent on revenge?
---
All around the hive battle ship is bunting. Its unknown why the hive have developed bunting but we must find out why
---
I have the same issue. Friends asked me to come try the game again but I'm locked out of this content until October. I also am not able to pick up some items from Xur that my buddies told me to get. I missed it by 2 days unfortunately, but it is what it is. I understand why, but I'm still kind of sad that I can't do some of the stuff my friend's are doing.
---
Being relatively new I'm just going to try to figure out what items I can get with what I have access to and how I can improve in preparation for upcoming content. I haven't figured out what the best goals are given what I have access to (since I basically have no idea what I'm doing for now), but it seems that there should be enough to keep me occupied for a few weeks.
---
On the bright side, it won't be too much longer until we can access this. Hoping you can find ways to enjoy the game in the meantime. Have a great day.
---
Yeah i do. I have either 2 or 3. But i constantly use the heavy and need more :/
---
It doesn‚Äôt help that his contact with the Nine has upset his mental health a lot.
---
No shit... Where has my fucking life gone man..
---
Yeah, again, it's not hard, none of the quest steps are, they just all require time.  And the 25/25/25 matches takes a loooong time.
---
So just saying that while you can "smell the finish line", you still have a decent ways to go. Not that you won't get it, but just giving you a heads up to keep on grinding/pushing!
---
I have 12 more Comp matches to play and then 20 bounties to turn in (9 saved).
---
Then;
---
A. Don't grind for it.
---
B. Practice with friends and work together to get it.
---
I‚Äôm more bother with them not creating a new weapon an instead giving people the 2 tailed fox which I‚Äôm sure everyone has by now
---
Lets take a minute to appreciate "Bang" "kok"
---
Oh, don‚Äôt get me wrong. D1 was fucking great, but it wasn‚Äôt this heavenly game that everyone thinks it was
---
Uhhh the Camp Fire was only last year.
---
Um so sick of using Well, hate that power, I just use whatever super I feel like now instead
---
Im on my last reset atm, i took advantage of the ib a couple weeks ago, all i played tbh lol and yea that reset for gambit was the worst
---
Big props for Bottom Tree Sunbreaker, my go to PvP class on my Titan.
---
I don't get why they don't nerf it already, it honestly ruins pvp games especially competitive. Try playing survival or countdown when a striker drops its shit. I have honestly jumped off of maps before now to stop them getting a kill, as no matter what I throw at them those fuckers just keep coming.
---
They should have bolded "all players will recieve the forsaken pass for free"..
---
That's awesome. It feels like it's too large though.
---
I did not know this was a thing, thanks!

I'd assume the reason they give 2 tailed fox with the ornament is mainly for the people who come in with new light and buy Shadowkeep as it's the hottest new bit.
---
At our school youd have to pay 150$ minimum for back parking spaces and the front ones would easily go for 1000$+.
---
Aren't those for Playstation only?
---
I honestly don't care about using well because at least Im doing the raid
---
Appreciate it! I will keep pushing, you're way ahead of me so, if you're on xbox or pc, I will see you on the other side!

I experienced the Mad Warden fight. Fun and simpler times. Of course... i still need to get that achievement where a Warlock with either a healing rift or Well just stays out in the open and survives a round of the Warden spreading a lit soundtrack all over.
---
This is dope. Too bad I can‚Äôt do that at my office. Or can I?.... ü§î
---
I t-bagged, danced and ate popcorn. He woulda been proud.
---
Tell me about it. I love running Graviton Lance on that strike and going full on Torgue with void explosions.
---
The solstice is over, and theres a quest line for free 690 gear on all 3 chars, look in pursuits
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure Malfeasance also works if you have it.
---
You can
---
And the faction people, vanguard, planet vendors and arcite. Rip to arcite he lost his job selling us the godroll guns.
---
How do you know? Do you have virtual gay-far?
---
That's not a mastery issue that's a not very well coded issue

Ironically Halo was the Halo killer
---
worm only worked at mid to long range playing only to worms strengths, OEM works everywhere and requires no actions past what your already doing. a titan gets a shoulder charge kill then has overshields and a damage boost, where he can get a chain of kills and get full healed and keep a 20% damage boost after each one, until the titan gets unlucky or teamed. 
---
OEM is far stronger than worm ever was.
---
Everybody is using shotguns and tracking weapons.
---
Don‚Äôt blame the titans for using something that‚Äôs good for the short amount of time they can before it‚Äôs nerfed.
---
RIP. Best thing to come from CoO IMO. I can‚Äôt wait for Bungie to complete the Perfect Paradox. It will be an epic moment.
---
I don't get it either man. I busted my ass to get that thing and my Chattering Bone is way better. It just sits in the vault collecting dust.
---
Sunshot for me! Sooo satisfying
---
That's what I thought too, and I somehow got it off of a public event drop a few days ago
---
Are you asking for improvements now instead of when shadow keep launches?
---
As soon as they can implement them. People shouldn‚Äôt be punished for playing against people on a 200 ping, nor should they be punished for having a numerical disadvantage
---
Your school actually does that my school doesn‚Äôt do shit for their senior parking spots
---
I mean why CHEESE it. I acquired it in the beginning of the season it was added and did not experience any issue.  
---
I know why people want this weapoin since I've been using it since then.  
---
Why **cheese** it?
---
I miss dinklebot...
---
Bye no skill titans.
---
The first time I did Mad Warden with my brother we didn‚Äôt know you could just melt him down, we focused on all of the enemies around him, desperately his when he lights up, and took pot shots whenever we could. Probably my most fun experience ever in Destiny. It gets so intense and desperate.
---
You‚Äôre the worst
---
F for your pride
---
Is that a Mac? If so, badass decal placement.
---
Drifter talked about that.

Had a Comp game like that the other day, two people disco'd/left right at the start and we found the two left just chilling at spawn point using Emotes. All solos on my team and we started hanging out for the timer. I'm in the middle of grinding Mountaintop and had snagged heavy ammo for no reason. Told my Fireteam I was grinding and they said to see if the enemy was down to let me get some doubles. Got their attention somehow and somehow got across what I was doing. They grouped up and let me get a few kills. Sometimes people just are awesome.
---
Cayde always has to steal the spotlight.
---
I have reckoner; you need massacre medals to achieve reckoner. Ergo your argument is disproven.
---
Is there a higher quality version of this image?
---
Where is Eris Morn? ^^
---
Awesome thanks! You've been a big help
---
If the fallen had sniped Dinklage they would have won the war. They should have know about ghosts since all those Vanguard wars.
---
Don't know if this is to scale but this reminds me of when I saw some concept armor that really highlighted how massive guns in Destiny really are
---
Ah fuck, I can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôve done this
---
*Kind of* in the sense that you're simply resetting something.  The main difference is that Prestiging in CoD (from what I remember) starts you over from scratch.  Resetting your valor rank doesn't take anything away from you at all.  Actually, it's pretty awesome because after you hit 2000 points and reset, you actually get loot as a reward.
---
Well....
---
I didn't know fatal funnels existed outside of fatal funnels.
---
Everyone before a raid: Well
---
Everyone before a reckoning: Well 
---
Everyone before nightfall: Well

Aren't wormgods considered like the top of the foodchain in the hive? Since that's the creatures oryx and her sister's got the worms from in the beginning
---
So people shouldn‚Äôt share clips on this sub-reddit anymore unless they‚Äôre on PC because there‚Äôs no reason they should?
---
I‚Äôve used mb and fighting lion with play of the game and had a ton of success in comp with the kills and decent on multikills but minimal success on the medals... I think I‚Äôm gonna do comp for everything but medals then do QP for medals.. thoughts?
---
Damn, I haven‚Äôt seen a prime engram like that in 20 years
---
I don‚Äôt know how much of a difference this makes, but for console I use a one x and one of those German TVs that make some games play in ‚Äúfake 60 frames‚Äù I think there‚Äôs a video of it on YouTube. I‚Äôll try to find it for you.
---
Edit: here‚Äôs the link for you :) https://youtu.be/lirePKYjFs4
---
Fuck the taken
---
My new wallpaper
---
Well, this convinced me: I'm leveling my Titan for IB kicking.
---
That's not what I'm saying at all, just ranting that it's hard to watch console clips with the movement/aim the way it is.
---
I wish i could play with my father, this kind of post make le emotional (he is not dead, he just don't like video games)
---
God damn it!!!!!
---
Is this a Jojo reference?
---
Um... who gives a shit?
---
I have earned 3 massacre medals when I wasn‚Äôt trying but when i started trying and I can‚Äôt get any. Haha
---
heh
---
Titans have supers in raids? I thought we were just a ghetto Lunafaction.
---
Where is galaran
---
What‚Äôs the blue horse at the top?
---
Mars ones
---
As long as you can maintain an average of at least a couple of multikills per match in comp, you should be golden doing that.  I actually had the opposite problem where I was getting plenty of medals but struggled to get the multikills.  But that's probably because I didn't have Militia's Birthright going for me...
---
It's just a rant, you don't have to care or reply to it.
---
Not everyone can afford gaming PCs, decent ones at that and some people straight up just choose to play on console. Just let it be man there‚Äôs no need to be posting negative stuff and exaggerating how awful it is compared to your platform of choice, if it‚Äôs as painful to watch for you as you say, just don‚Äôt watch it.
---
No arial play. Damage over a time so slower peaks. Yeah not gonna be meta.
---
I'm printing this and giving it to my wife for valentines day.
---
If you have no life, what do I have?
---
Uh ok... You just want easy mode mouse stuff?
---
I believe it‚Äôs riven when he pokes his head out and we dump all of our swarm nades into his mouth while someone shoots tractor with wells and someone blowing themselves up because NO ONE KNOWS HOW TO STAND STILL FOR DAMAGE. 
---
^(i could be wrong though)
---
Edit: what‚Äôs that blue horse at the top mid?
---
This is the greatest selfie ever
---
Everyone has shared this thought.
---
Ah, I'm sorry about that lack of particular connection. My dad is retired army but has always been a gamer. He started me young so it's awesome to play now that he's retired from that particular career.
---
I meant more seeing anarchy and 1k voices in postmaster and having no idea. Sorry for the no context.
---
You post, we comment, s‚Äôhow it works
---
Reeeeeeee
---
*sighs*
---
Thats a public Event. Are you unlocking forges at the moment?
---
It even has that horse from that one Drifter vision!
---
Be nice if Bungie made some improvements.
---
This has always been an issue of mine with being a warlock. It's my favorite class by far but in Both D1 and D2 there is an ability that is boring to use but is so much better for the raid so you never get to really use the fun supers.
---
I mean if you read the rant you'd know I already said I don't watch them...
---
Wtf
---
LET ME IIIIIIIIIINNNNNNN
---
Then what the fuck do you have to whine about? Go watch some YT vids if Reddit ain‚Äôt doing it for ya.
---
I like that you have an alt account for the destiny reddit so you can say dumb shit like this
---
Whoa whoa whoa, why are you getting agitated over here? It's just a little rant there's no reason for anyone to get angry.
---
I created a head cannon for my Guardian a while ago. Primarily because I despise the "chosen one" narrative that has overtaken our culture.
---
I‚Äôm not angry.
---
Per the TWAB: "Remember, to qualify for the exclusive Community Event Emblem, you will need to complete one Nightfall before next Tuesday at 10:00 AM Pacific."
---
Makes sense, thanks for clarifying
---
Pretty sure I said dodge and weave on the next two circle when they spawn on you , can‚Äôt you read?
---
Honestly I'm excited to ask what super should i run and getting back bubble 6x its gonna be great!
---
Compensation so being so terrible at crucible?  lol. (This is purely in jest, please do not take it seriously)
---
I am pretty sure one of the latest updates was supposed to adjust for those who were not getting exotics at a fair rate - so you my be benefitting from that.
---
I‚Äôm doubting this because 
---
1. We already got the Drifters ship instead of NanoPhoenix so I‚Äôm not sure where else we would get it. 
---
2. The original D1 Arcadia Class Jumpship is coming back (along with Khvostov and the OG Generalist Shell) so you probably mistook that ship for Nano Phoenix
---
Id farm the emote if i could but cant ever get a group going anymore :/
---
" joins the slow clapping"
---
Both have their uses, and one will be better in some situations than the other.  For raw damage Bubble will be better, but that‚Äôs not every activity.
---
Holy shot! DINKLEBOT!
---
What part of making a quality of life change on pc affects you? This is basically being kind of petty saying that since you guys can't have it we shouldn't either.
---
Face üå¥. hilarious
---
I mean some people are saying that, since apparently "console players will be left behind."
---
I never understood this narrative in an online game.
---
So I'm the chosen one... but so is everybody else?
---
thank you for the help much appreciated
---
I'm admiring the dude that's named microwave. What a good name
---
AoE kills everyone
---
lol its k, I am pretty bad lmao
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
There was? I hadnt gotten anything in years so maybe this is lol
---
If there‚Äòs another capable Warlock, I become geomag man.
---
Damn, I fall for that EVERY TIME!
---
I was literally almost crying because I spent so long doing the whole thing solo
---
Okay, that guys in the wrong too but he said that way after I posted my previous comment lmao
---
I saw it super fast on a Houndish video. I‚Äôm new to this reddit posting.[houndish ](https://youtu.be/MmzHOKKHbjI) at 1:27 seconds to 1:32
---
Well take out Valus Ta‚Äôaurc, Commander of the Siege Dancers!
---
Damn, be a little more respectful my guy.
---
Well dang it. I got really excited. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I ran Wrath of the Machine and never got the ship.
---
Smallest Great Jagras
---
I feel ya buddy. *looks at the slot for my last missing D1 Y3 exotic - Vex Mythoclast*
---
What gun is that?
---
But what major advantage does that give you
---
I'm stuff
---
Nah I‚Äôm good
---
It's an armor 2.0 mod
---
my vault is full of random shit just like d1 n i hate my self oh now that i think about it i guess i can remove ever y1 stuff
---
Well I mean the point of TLW is to always hip fire it, but I get what you mean.
---
I looked it up and i have one more question. You cant get all these weapons still right?
---
# DAMM IT
---
F
---
You can I believe, all the quests are still available at their respective vendors, I just yesterday got my Luna‚Äôs howl
---
Same. I'd prefer him over Nolan.
---
I had potato ass hip fire aim when I used it in D1. I was always used to aiming down sights with it until it came back in D2. I got more used to hip fire. Otherwise, it‚Äôs still a little clunky like most hand cannons.
---
Xol definitely should require you to get those crits on his side or use the javelin to unlock a damage phase.
---
Agreed.
---
Ok awesome thank you
---
If u wanna slide around a corner with a shotgun you can know wether they're right around the corner or several meters back, or if you're hardscoping with a sniper you can know exactly when they're gonna peak so you can get the headshot, what situation would a radar benefit you over tracking?
---
r/lostredditors?
---
LuNiFiCaTiOn idk why but it pisses me off when ppl say it like that
---
what?
---
Why is this posted on a destiny sub?
