Lord Shaxx is a great motivator, 10/10! Would play Crucible again.

I miss it so much but I dont think they can implement on the 4v4 style of small maps they made, some of the newer ones are bigger but that still might be a push

You can, Guardian! Believe in what you do!

wont double your chances but will increase your chances in getting special ammo .

Oh man if I used the prenerf nova warp there on the last guy, he wouldn't have even put me on crit, I'd just teleport through the fire. The good old days...

Thanks man! Try your best, Guardian! Nothing can stand in our way!

No one would be forced into microtransactions and at no point did I remark that Bungie should add more micro transactions. I did however, I did claim it would encourage players to purchase microtransactions that are already present in the game. But as you clearly point out and admit, Bungie shouldn't waste their time on novelty items and activities that don't add any story to the game. So by the same property they shouldnt waste their time on new cosmetic shaders, new ships, new sparrows, new ghost shells or anything that isn't directly story related. If you can't see that your argument is already moot by the fact that micro-transactions already exist in Destiny, and Bungie commits a great deal of resources to cosmetic item design, then there's nothing left to talk about. Simply put,I Get it, you don't want SRL back because it offers nothing for you, that's fine. But with Destiny being an MMO, its not about what YOU want instead of SRL, but what the community wants and what will make Bungie the most money long term.

Has to be curse week which is next week I think

Oh! Thank you!

They're great in Crucible. But everything's pretty much one shot in PVE and if it's not then just use a shotgun and it gets the job done better. What we really need is more medium-long range Special weapons, like non-Exotic Trace Rifles and maybe a new type of Fusion Rifle that has a really fast charge time but only fires 2-4 beams and has more ammo to compensate. The biggest issue with Sidearms and SMGs right now is that a shotgun just does everything better and not everyone wants to use a Sniper, especially on PC. I personally enjoy using an SMG and a Fusion Rifle but neither of those can really compete with most other weapon types in PVE. Hand Cannon and Shotgun is the way to go for nearly every encounter you find yourself in.

You might be right, but FWIW there are issues on other guns with crit requirements to proc perks. Luna's Howl/Not Forgotten have issues where you can land 3+ crits in a row (three yellow 57s pop on screen) without Magnificent Howl proccing, so might not necessarily be a missed shot issue. 
---
so u can do an encounter, and then leave, and come back again with your progress saved?
---
Yup as long you as you finish the encounter and make sure your party leader when you come back at it. 
---
While you're partially right, your comparison pictures are an absolute joke. D2 wins here by a landslide
---
ok and if you aren‚Äôt then you have to get the party leader when the raid started to come to it?
---
No it doesn‚Äôt WTF üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Well everyone who finishes the encounter together gets the checkpoint. So doesn't matter who's party leader when you finish the encounter. But yeah if you join another group and your not party leader you'll start fresh or wherever the party leader has a cp.

Someone already said it, the D1 picture you chose looks like some blocky pink starburst. Take this L

ok thanks

It drops curated from doing anything that awards a collector synth in a gambit prime match or randomly from the gambit prime weekly/yes sir I'm a closer bounty, or from Oryx tier 2 and 3 of reckoning.
---
That‚Äôs a lot of Eververse, buddy
---
1) I believe the quickest way to get higher tier helmets is to have any tier 3 helmet and then spam tier 2s until you get a tier 2 helmet of the type you like and then upgrade it with the weekly bounty (having tier 3 unlocks tier 2 helmet drops and having a tier 2 unlocks tier 1 helmet drops without doing the weekly bounty iirc)
---
2) The drop rates for the guns are all over the place and frankly much too low if you're chasing god rolls. I believe Oryx this week drops Doomsday, Spare Rations, Outlast, Bug out Bug and one other (don't know if it's gnawing hunger or not.)
---
3) Arbalest is not obtainable as of yet.
---
You have to be patient with the final encounter.  Also know when the shrieker teleports helps too. When it go into its last stand I head to the very top left of the map (where the ogres spawn in) and whisper the nights down from there. 
---
The nearest Knight has to be taken out quickly, because he will charge to your location. 5-6 headshots take him out. 
---
Rest is easy. Pop the orb under savathun and pop your super and you have ol thorny. 
---
No spoils. My ears will leak red sticky stuff.
---
Personally I don't see how they even remotely compare.  I use both exotics quite a bit and found myself playing Titan more because Recluse + OEM = you're making your own TTK &gt;1 second  while maintaining a &lt;0.5 second TTK with Recluse, and you have wallhacks.  Crispy handling and the dodges are nice, but OEM gets me more kills and less deaths.

The one on the right looks like a badass space pirate/viking warlord. The one on the left looks like a strawberry

Buy exotics from collections and bring up other gear you use here and there, there's only one lighted event, the reckoning, which is pretty one dimensional... besides IB lol. So you can catch up side gear and w/e to 680 with no cores. It's close enough

You know what?  I‚Äôm gonna say it. No one on this sub should ever talk about balance because every time one of these posts gets put up, it gets over 3K upvotes and all the comments talk about how shit they are at the crucible. Y‚Äôall don‚Äôt ever need to decide what gets nerfed and what gets buffed. 
---
Jesus Christ. You guys just jumped this guy for saying it‚Äôs not hard to get a positive KD. It‚Äôs not hard. Y‚Äôall just need to get good. And I say this as someone who only started the Luna grind this season and just got Recluse this week. I soloed my way to Fabled 1. It‚Äôs not that bad. Just play smart and play with your team. 
---
Cool. Then those people probably shouldn‚Äôt complain about shit being overpowered if they aren‚Äôt going to take the time to learn how to play against it. Just like the PvP players shouldn‚Äôt complain about the difficulty of the raid if they don‚Äôt take the time to learn the encounters. You guys are spouting off a lot of hypocrisy and then trying to hide behind the excuse that you‚Äôre all not trying.

EoW is fairly forgiving, Spire of Stars is rather demanding.
---
Remember that one mission in Hitman: Absolution where the game just dropped you in an empty desert with one of the characters, with half a dozen ways of killing him lying around? I must have reloaded and played that level a dozen times, just to try each method out. There was a hilarious Easter egg, too.

Get good with fighting lion. Its really fantastic to use once you learn the gun.

I have a lot of fun in quick play harassing the other team with some well placed shots. Also keep in mind that you can time release the shot to be more precise. 
---
What exotic? Black talon still exists

I like the rare super fights. I sometimes get to have ninja battles with other Spectral Blades or Arcstriders. Feels pretty cool even if I end up being the one dying.

I see this Dredgen thing everywhere, anyone wanna explain to me what it is?

I feel like a roll because bungie wants to give me errors that are on their side. I got a 30min competitive ban because they can‚Äôt fix their servers

How do you get this gun? One of the raids?

It‚Äôs ok the warlock bond for gambit prime (any of them) I think

ohh, yeah that's a load of shit :(

Hawthorne now gives 7 per week, get one from spider per day, that's 14 for free per week. If you play actively and do scrapper bounties that's at least another 10, making it 24 per week, don't spend them on anything but important infusions and you'll find yourself having a lot :) 
---
It is. I was 2 games in and my friend and i were stuck with 3v4 and were literally going to force shaxx to call it and then I get hit with the guitar error forcing me out and giving me a 30min ban. And to top it off I went from 1086 rank(or along those lines) to 921 üôÑ

Ik how to use the FL :) 
---
thanks though
---
5 win streak was clutch for me
---
Gl to you man
---
For some reason I have 2 auto rifle scavengers and 2 auto rifles so unless I run out of ammo in 1 gun it's too much ammo to pickup. 
---
Most people just dont bother checkinh cant expect everyone to look at your stuff. And heavy is there for everyone not just the invader there are high value targets to kill and to store heavy for primeval.
---
I was actually thinking about an exotic class armor piece that let's you carry two weapons. Bungo, please bring that in! 
---
We're riding this hate train together. I totally agree. Don't become EA, Bungie!
---
Or just try with any other fucking thing less important. 
---
Yep 100%. Popped up after the 78 mote game. Checked my destiny tracker, had two games where I only banked 60ish prior to that. The game I banked 103, I had lost 3, and so wouldn't have given me the triumph anyway. Besides which, it was two full games prior to when the triumph completed notification popped up.
---
First thought that came to me was fucking idiot. 
---
Every other item in a stack dies one at a time.
---
This was done on purpose by bungo.
---
I guarantee it.
---
When you have spectral blades ready and see the entire enemy team on a point
---
The other thing is that regardless of whether you or a team mate get it, everyone in your team gets the triumph. So I did it the other day, and I believe my buddy got it as a result.
---
I switched back to a Bygones I'll have you know!
---
If your team is getting wiped that bad than thats just your team being bad. I get spectral blades are op but at certains you have to ask yourself if its that spectral blades are godly or your team just sucks. Hell a hammer titan or arc strider can do that shit too to a shitty team.
---
Lookin fine. Hope he gets that memory foam ornament; that's gonna look real nice. 
---
Get lost 
---
I think it's a dead orbit weapon
---
I'll sometimes take the power ammo for Tractor Cannon so I have some for the primeval. Pretty much the only reason to do it when you aren't the invader though in my opinion. And you only need the one brick, save it to the end.
---
On this picture destiny is horse so Kinda anthem would go nowhere without destiny
---
Yeah...but also for cool guns and armour. Mainly. 
---
Now I have to ask, since this looks so close to the in-game, but did you draw this or is it just a screenshot? If the former, awesome job, but if the latter, you may wanna not do this since you could get sued pretty hard.
---
Pc recoil is the way it is because of the accuracy of a mouse which you aim and shot with. While on console you dont get that same accuracy because you gotta work both the analogue stick and bumper. No change whatsoever would make controllers begin to have that same level of accuracy.
---
Lmao bonerboy Jones. What a name
---
Masterwork your armor, 1% damage resistance while in super per MW point for PVP
---
That was the best use of blade barrage I've ever seen! 
---
It shouldn‚Äôt get nerfed into the ground but when the number 1 ranked pvp player (atm) has to run it‚Äôs a issue. I was watching zk mushroom on twitch even he had to run and his team got wiped by a single spectral. Some on their team was running spectral and did it back at them. It doesn‚Äôt make it okay that they each wipes each other twice on a single spectral.
---
They probably should cuz those solos probably don‚Äôt win many matches with that ideology.
---
Titan on the left looks better
---
2000 IQ right there. So much regret....
---
I'm also a dedicated sentry.  I do love my jotunn.

And now you know why playing anything solo is a tossup and stacks tend to win more.
---
You are right. I mixed it up. My bad.
---
Lord of wolves and threat level with 15 reaper and I seem to not only have mostly full special, but heavy ammo bricks seem to drop at an abnormal rate and after every prime game there's like 5-6 bricks lying around that I just couldn't pick up. 
---
Also 10 from hitting Valor Legend in crucible
---
Laughs in retold tale
---
Spectral blades user here. Agreed it does need a nerf. It‚Äôs literally the only super used in comp and when the super can last 28 seconds and have 70% damage reduction with masterwork armor you know something is off
---
I lack the friends so I‚Äôll just suffer in solos lol
---
140s (and in that respect 150s) are unusable but midnight coup and kindled (150 and 140)  are both amazing guns in pve and pve/pvp respectively... duke is also a monster in pvp.

It seems they worked hard! ^^

Try Xur's fated engram. Gives you a y1 exotic you don't have.
---
Yeah, it was one of their special guns.
---
LOL
---
Done that got the huckleberry lmao
---
Hold up, can you still do that or was this taken pre-fix?
---
yeah but just the same, it feels clumsy and slow and its not intuitive. I'd like to see that improved.

Bruh I'm so tired of Xur. He need to hurry tf up and bring Geomag Stabilizer. That's all the exotic I need! I got all the others.

You get a synth mid-game if you do certain things, and then you get a random synth at the end of the game. I have a relatively even distribution of around 40 each, at this point. They are consuming my vault space.

Yeah i wholeheartedly agree that they should make it easier for the player to check other players element

Spectral blades has as much dmg reduction as anyother super except gunslinger and well warlock. There is no extra tankiness. What makes it seem like it does is not only the invis which cuts off aim assist for enemies if your on console but also its attack speed which with its lunges gives that extra bit of mobility needed to dodge attacks. Let alone a full speed built hunter with the exotic that increases all around speed makes it all that faster. If any change at all to spectral blades would happen is an invis activation where it only activates on kill. Because any capable hunter can wipe a team and more with arcstrider which is alot worse because of the infinite dodge it gets and shield with the new tree.
---
Wildwood set
---
Yeah, sorry. Mobile does it sometimes, I'll delete it
---
Diverse? Its 5 fucking years old. They gave you a gun they made already, nerfed it 3x in the old one and you idiots are going nuts over it. D2 is a joke. Reskinning and selling all of d1's content, trying to salvage that piece of shit. 
---
Unless you‚Äôre playing with blueberries who refuse to deposit anything lower than 15 notes so you and your teammates are sitting there 4 motes away and the guy proceeds to run around killing shit with 11 motes
---
It's not a balance issue though. You guys out special circumstances and go over board with it. This is a stupid example of wanting something nerfed. Chances are his light level was lower and created a scenario. I was sniped out of SB running towards a Titan. It's people like OP and you who ruin this game. Nova warp had it's balls removed. Granted it shouldn't have worked through walls but what they did to it was wrong. 
---
Golden gun damage reduction needs to be buffed lmao. Literally no dmg reduction, you will die in your animation
---
Thanks, I‚Äôm hoping to spend today and tomorrow grinding 
---
Try announcing in chat that you are Collector and please let you grab motes. I‚Äôve played a lot of Prime and if you actually communicate before match begins and use words like ‚Äúplease‚Äù 90% of the time people go out of their way to help you.
---
I don‚Äôt have any Invader gear but I‚Äôm beast at  invading. You would be surprised how often the actual invader lets me invade if I just say ‚Äúhey I‚Äôm good at invading can I try?‚Äù. I do usually wait for them to fuck up first which really helps my success rate. You could try directly messaging someone who just dropped motes and make it like you‚Äôre trying to do them a favor so they can do other stuff.
---
That is exactly what I ment xD

I'm still waiting for exotic pulse but i will not get it even in penumbra :(

So. You play PvP. But you're not a PvP player?

Now it‚Äôs understandable he didn‚Äôt want to send the entire guardian force after Cayde or anything, but a few guardians would‚Äôve been fine. It‚Äôs more that when the one guardian who did go out and kill Uldron came back Zavala acted like you just went out and killed him to satisfy your murder boner, as if he never disturbed us and we just killed him cuz he looked at us funny.
---
I did play the first game and am well aware of what the SIVA crisis was. Rasputin‚Äôs only purpose is to protect humanity, and if what Drifter said about the Iron Lords is to be believed they definitely weren‚Äôt on the side of the people.

Zavala seemed ok with messing with Rasputin at first, but when Rasputin said he was going to protect humanity and not listen to what Zavala said Zavala immediately went from being willing to try it to being scared shitless of Rasputin as soon as Rasputin said he wasn‚Äôt going to take orders from the Vanguard.
---
It seems Zavala is afraid of any power he doesn‚Äôt control, even if it‚Äôs allied with him
---
Wait until she sells them again pretty much
---
Yeah it looks like the barrel is at an angle and the handle is from a side perspective, other than that pretty good
---
##SLAP THAT "LIKE" BUTTON LIKE YO MAMMA TAUGHT YOU RIGHT
---
Tbh that was the one I wanted hawkmoon was my favorite 
---
Oh yeah the glitches are pretty dumb don't get me wrong, I just don't think destiny is a competitive game.
---
Vigilance Wing will always be one of my favorite exotics ever! Another exotic pulse rifle would be amazing 
---
I got a kill clip+triple tap, but its reload is godawful
---
I got that too and I was like wtf
---
I don't understand the use of the pacman dots 
---
Bro I feel you. 52 clears before I got one. Another guy I know was post 100 clears :( Something is off with that drop. The people who have gotten it, tend to get it over and over and over, an the people who don't seem to take forever to finally get it.
---
For anyone who is doing that in the future, I will say it's WAAAAAAY easier in Comp and IB than in QP. And if you're a PVE player, the lower rank comp matches will be full of potatoes anyway, so it'll probably be more fun than trying to play against people who quit Comp after getting Lunas/NF. 
---
I got 16 and never even heard of Destiny 2.
---
Lol at first I was like 'o cool a new season!.. wait... no... that's not right.'
---
I'm getting really fucking tired of hearing PVP players shit on PVE players.
---
How small and lonely must their world be that they feel the need to mock people for their game choices?
---
It does at base, but being invisible increases the DR. Which makes no sense
---
I guess so 
---
No, definitely rocking 690+ as a Void Warlock. I would assume most would see that and trust I'm decent. But not a bad thought.
---
I seriously don't get this Reddit what did I say to get down voted?
---
I see people talk about fashion over specs when playing destiny, but that Titan actually did it.
---
When you hover over Arbalest, it says it is a rare drop, not from a quest. Some items do have incorrect descriptions in collections, but I speculate Arbalest will be like Thunderlord. There will be a limited time quest for it with one of the two holiday events, and after a certain period of time it will become a random drop like any other exotic. 
---
Hunter like flexibility 
---
yup!
---
Then your game sense is horrible. For starters, every interval of 25 (save primeval summoning) with allow an invade. Pay attention to that. For primeval phase, don‚Äôt stand in the open and you‚Äôll be fine. 
---
Is it that good? I haven't bothered with since I've been playing with the exotics. 
---
I don't know how one-eyed works, but I'm in love with the foetracer right now!
---
If you have the companion app all you have to do is click a button on the app and it automatically sends an invite to everyone who signed up
---
They should just add a slider for how many you want to dismantle at a time for all consumables. Problem solved
---
Where
---
Theyre not that rare and you dont have to infuse your gear every time you get a powerful drop
---
Omg the reticle was red and I was thinking KILL HIMMMMMM
---
But do NOT disrespect my boy Zavala! The guy has led us to victory thus far and it essentially the de facto leader of humanity as it stands, gotta give the guy a break he has immense pressure on his shoulders. He is in charge of the last remnants of humanity, if he acts rashly and people get harmed, he will blame himself just like the Red War
---
Idk, but every time I seen ‚ÄúDepression is invading‚Äù ...I felt that shit. 
---
Lol I won my last 10 games in a row solo queuing
---
No, most quest progress is on a per character basis. You can pick up the Breakneck quest on your other characters, though you will have to start from the beginning. 
---
The quest progress that is account based vs. character based are only Mountaintop, Recluse, Oxygen, and 21% Delirium, since those item's quests ask you to do triumphs, and triumphs are account wide. 
---
I am sorry for that I didn‚Äôt see your comment and if I did I wouldn‚Äôt have typed it
---
as a spectral blades main: yes. nerf the damage reduction but leave every other aspect alone, thx
---
Bygones is reliable. 
---
Is that level 20? As ive already got 2 characters to level 20 ill have to see what my friends want to do 
---
You‚Äôre hired
---
I had this problem where no one could invite me through the app and it turns out you have to have your settings so that anyone can send you a message. After I changed that, people were able to invite me no problem. Maybe it has something to do with that?
---
What's the god roll?
---
Oooooo, so clean, I Love it man! Great job!
---
I have almost that exact roll. Stability masterwork though. Love this gun
---
You noticed the username too, huh? I chuckled to myself about it. 
---
F
---
Getting ace before powering up. Sorry i didn‚Äôt clarify 
---
Good meme, 10/10
---
No. I didn‚Äôt have the kills done and then got to fabled and dropped below. A day later I did the kills and I still got it.
---
I mean that's not true, the worst people are the ones that play super casually so don't know what they're doing. 
---
All shotguns and erentil fr4
---
Im a Sentry that runs a Reaper set. The power ammo is to feed my Plan B in case I miss my Honed Edge shot. Gotta keep the bois back home safe while you're kicking names and taking ass.
---
Yes it was
---
I didn't get it. So I'm now on 83 chests opened without 1k.
---
Mix winner, u/420notgay420
---
Good to know
---
Yes, it's retroactive. But a lot easier to do the quest steps in low comp then smash your way to 2100 after the 100 headshots tbh
---
I mean he‚Äôs got super armor anyways during his super idk if you would have killed him
---
Rift was literally my favorite game mode (besides mayhem) back in the day. But I think there were some people who didn't like it. I think if they brought it back with minor changes to balance it for D2 it would be so much fun.
---
Vanguard got you pushing too many pencils?
---
You may not like it, but this is what peak human performance looks like. 
---
High impact snipe to the head before he ulted should have kill him
---
Oh I thought you missed the snipe, cuz I assumed he would‚Äôve died if it hit, proving your point lmao
---
To be honest I think destiny 2 felt like this for a long time. it's when you haven't played for a long time and then come back and have to do a bunch of stuff to be good again at anything PVP or pve. It's just a boring grind and makes me not want to play it. The only thing I like about destiny nowadays is the lore and story... It's always keeps me coming back just to watch the youtube videos about the lore. Destiny 3 needs to be better than this it can't just be another mmo grind. 
---
Hunter main, get a Luna asap and ggs
---
We aren‚Äôt scared of it we just don‚Äôt like doing things that aren‚Äôt fun like crucible
---
On the ground
---
ohhhhh ok nice. loading into the 4-stack is always a fun-killer for sure. thanks for the info!
---
I‚Äôm gonna start wearing my old iron banner gear once I‚Äôm high enough light for it to not matter anymore. Only issue I‚Äôll have is not having Traction on the boots. I hate playing without Traction. 
---
Make a post on destinylfg bud, might have better luck there bc some posts get buried. I would help but I'm on Xbox.
---
I had a stroke trying to read that
---
Like even if I‚Äôm cringe or get downvoted for saying stuff like this, I‚Äôll be damned to hell before I lie to better appeal myself to others. So what if others don‚Äôt like it? I refuse to not be honest.
---
The catalyst ,when complete, kicks whoever you shoot, out of the game
---
OEM? Ew
---
Dillon!
---
Pretty sure that was unnerfed MIDA
---
The cryptarch's located at your local post office.
---
I call that a target-rich environment!
---
Any new exotics that aren't hand cannons would be great...
