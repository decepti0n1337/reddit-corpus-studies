Get some friends together and tell them
---
You gotta kill him so they wont
---
---
---
Bungies have implemented the "contest mode" for worlds first meaning that having a high light level means nothing during worlds first, so I am in agreement with op there shouldn't be a high light requirement for worlds first since there's no advantages for having a high light level to begin with.
---
I was pretty excited to see i got the clip down lol
---
they reskinned the pricetag.
---
Erida's Vow might break their immune...
---
I haven't tried it tho
---
What is that helmet from? IT IS GORGEOUS
---
TOUCH DOWN!
---

---
Someone on Destiny is going to be a Heisman winner if he keeps this up.
---
Ever since we have gotten random rolls back people have been asking for forge weapons to be randomly rolled. Bungie literally did what a ton of people were asking for.
---
I can only imagine lol also I should know this by now I do YouTube as a side thing!! Lol
---
Its showing $59.99 on xbox for me
---
Exactly, and I've been struggling to find the cause because it screwed me over several times in Ordeal and Gambit
---
Don't think it's heat throttle, not RAM issue and Destiny 2 uses the GPU instead of integrated GPU
---
Pretty sure the darkest day emblem is not attainable.
---
You can‚Äôt use the card with ordeals, it‚Äôs not what it‚Äôs for. I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre going for the 100k, you have to do the master ordeal to be able to do that.
---
Not released yet
---
Jump up to where you came in and just unload on him.

Warlock Transmog helm
---
I absolutely love how all armor can be relevant now
---
*You will never reach Truth*
---
It can either drop from xur or a random powerful/world drop :)
---
Don't worry it RNG(Random Number Gernerated) so it just luck, good luck and have fun playing.
---
Ah...then is there a road map?
---
Is your power plan on max performance? Are you gaming with laptop plugged in? Also, use msi afterburner to monitor temps.
---
‚ö†Ô∏è [NSFW] SEIZURE W A R N I N G   ‚ö†Ô∏è
---
Gambit is easy. Kill mobs, deposit motes in center. Kill blockers in center. Kill invaders before they kill you. Invade them. Bank enough motes to summon boss. Kill boss
---
OK so you don\`t want cruicible pinnacle weapons to be good in pve and vise versa, gotcha, nothing wrong with that.  
---
I kind of like it though, I enjoy pvp the most so if I can bring those weapons into pve when I want to it\`s great for me, for practise.  
---
All i tried to say was that you don\`t need to go into the crucible and get the Recluse because there are other options out there which is as good and better for different pve situations.  
---
Riskrunner for instance is one that can outperform Recluse in many situations, I use that atleast as much as Recluse in pve, most likely more. I mean it can kill several mobs at once, it\`s almost OP ;)  
---
I also try to have fun with different kinds of weapons, not always the one that kills fastest, but thats just me.  
---
Mountaintop is just bonkers and I wish it was deleted from the game, both in pve and pvp \^\^
---
Where should I farm for random powerful drops?
---
Good combo using the dragonfly helm
---
Getting from 900-920 is also stupid easy as long as you walk and chew gum at the same time by completing bounties alongside milestones instead of one or the other. Plus valor/glory ranks (not sub ranks) give a powerful drop every time. Quit crying just cuz you don‚Äôt know how to prioritize.
---
Yeah this is the best my guardians have looked in a long time
---
No idea
---
That's the deluxe version with 4 season passes.  Shadowkeep itself is only $35.
---
I want this as an ornament!!
---
I just punch things
---
Well fuck
---
Kill yellowbars, throw orb in forge for two rounds this is repeated and then the spider tank drops. Melt legs to expose reactor, melt boss, repeat as many times as needed
---
Also if anyone says something about my motes or primeval damage, they had their primeval up a few minutes before we even had ours up so I sat on portal killing adds then jumping through to start popping skulls and heal that primeval up
---
Go try to get the chest glitch, it's pretty quick to get and you don't have to fight anyone
---
There's a big difference between things being hard to do and things just taking time to do. Quit meddling into discussions you don't understand.
---
Riskrunner is amazing in Bergusia, as almost all the Fallen there hit you with Arc. Shoot the spider bot‚Äôs legs (focus your fire on one) until the armor breaks &amp; the weak spot opens up, then unload. Celestial Goldengun, Chaos Reach, burn your heavy. Have one fireteam member on the blue adds, to keep the timer going.
---
I get what you mean, riskrunner being better definitely makes sence since it's an exotic and exotics are meant to be the best in the area they perform in (unfortunately alot of exotics arnt like this) mountaintop was out right broken last season but now that they have gotten rid of auto loading on alot of the abilitys in the game I think it's in a good place.
---
worked TY
---
With the mida mini tool you can reacquire it from the collections tab-it's on the same menu thingy as your inventory- It's the same as that for all Jon randomised weapons/armours.
---
I love how chock full of stuff the battle pass is. Just wish I    didn't have to treat Destiny like a job to get what I played for.
---
Nope, normal
---
Same here... was finally happy to get Liars Handshake and got Wavesplitter... I guess I can wait another week :/
---
I‚Äôm looking for someone to raid with I‚Äôm on Xbox anyone down
---
Riskrunner is your friend here. If you do it right, you'll never need to reload.
---
You can‚Äôt use the five of swords in the ordeal
---
Is liars good? I wanted to try and get it, but It always seems like people call it bad.
---
Wasn't trying to do heroic menagerie
---
Haha, I do feel that lost part. It's like a second life, at this point, just to keep up, but I like it.
---
&gt;60 with no mods is also the highest I've seen and it too came from a raid.
---
God I hope not.
---
I'm just trying to get all those invader kills. I'm the worst at PVP and I feel bad for using our team's invade when I come back with 1-2 kills if I'm lucky.
---
The most concise summary of OPs sob-story üëåüèª
---
well it seemed so... im very dissapointed too
---
Prime engrams are world drops, crucible rank ups, the new raid, etc. Just do anything that says "powerful reward" :)
---
Just follow these quests to unlock the stuff. If u are looking for the expansion content, hit up Amanda Holiday in the tower to do the 2 year 1 campaigns. For the black armory, u need to hit up spider in the tangled shore to get started on the quest to unlock the forges.
---
For gambit just launch it from the director
---
For the menagerie, keep power leveling then go talk to Benedict in the tower or in watcher's grave on nessus to kick-start the quest to unlock it
---
Yeah it‚Äôs shax broski
---
Ya know I this would be impossible but what if no one did the raid or vex offensive all season and never stopped the attack what would bungo do
---
My only problem is that you can't shoot while you're tethered. Otherwise, it's not that bad.
---
That‚Äôs a great theory, to the fallen we aren‚Äôt inherently evil, but eternal banes to an existence they so badly need to improve
---
I feel like the first into mission should be the start of the red war but then a message should pop up asking if you want to skip that campaign, so people who have already done it don‚Äôt have to do it again.
---
Yeah this happened to me multiple times, bizarre
---
I kept expecting those flimsy tongs to drop whatever that was into that pot of whatever that was...
---
Looked dangerous af really.
---
If you stay off the Crucible, yeah
---
Has anyone figured this out yet
---
Yep
---
Making a new character will have you do the original D1 starting mission so it might be nice to start anew for nostalgia but once you finish you can jump right into the action.
---
You need Xbox live to play, always have always will.  You'll need PS plus if you wish to play the game modes you mentioned
---
Literally the first thing I did was put that mod on recluse.  I didn't think it could be more powerful than it was..
---
I recently got it
---
And fuck man i got no fucking idea
---
Been googling everything and my mates been telling me about what was supposed to happen
---
Ive seen amanda halliday and picked up the red war campaign 
---
Gonna see if that introduces it still
---
Pretty shit though, does take away alot of the excitement
---
Ok, thanks!
---
I have never agreed with a reddit post more. We need to protest. This is the only bad thing that came out of the new update.
---
Thanks
---
I think there are less people saying theyre reusing content then there are people saying that people are saying theyre reusing content
---
The dragonfly reg is really underrated, good choice
---
Oh sorry, which tithe?
---
I‚Äôm a fan of Distant Relation tbh
---
For me when playing Destiny 2 its been The Sword, Warp Rider and Baroness, Yellow &amp; Green.
---
Warp Rider just seems like it was made for Destiny even though the album released in 2010.
---
really matters, I'm trying to hit legend and i was around 4500 and i started getting leavers and 2 good players vs 3 good players you get destroyed when they stick together. I'm not saying its impossible but definitely not an advantage.
---
Me after 12 hours of raiding
---
Yeee
---
I just don't have a group. I'm not the best at the game, and I don't want to spoil anyone elses fun by messing up the raid for them
---
Which I still don't understand the logic behind.
---
Next week br√∂ther
---
i agree but only time i left the 0-3 game was when my teammate was 0 points and i was under 1.0. so i don't think we were pulling that back, especially because he kept doing the sitting emote during 0-3
---
How do I get the free exotics?
---
Are you talking about paying a 5k glimemr tithe on the barge? It just means pay 5k glimmer
---
guy kept doing sitting emote during round 0-3 so kinda impossible to come back especially since his kill participation was 0
---
I can understand both you and where Bungie was coming from. 
---
I know that they wanted everyone to feel like they can join with friends and play together on the endgame stuff, and I believe they meant well with it. 
---
However I also can see that the way they went about it definitely could have used some work in helping new players start, kind of hard to know you need to see Amanda to get the story going and such. 
---
Hopefully your friend will stick with it and see that it is a great game.
---
Monte Carlo, he was really sorry he killed me
---
Did LW and Scourge today - at best they drop at +1, sometimes lower. Definitely not the +5/6 powerful anymore.
---
Yeah I just started as a F2P player and while I'm enjoying the gameplay itself and the sound design is amazing, and watching my gearscore go up, it's just like I have no idea who or what anything is, why I'm doing anything or who these people are who keep talking to me
---
I‚Äôve been doing this for a while solo as well.
---
Just put them in your vault.
---
Silly question, I know it doesn't matter, but I love the stupid cosmetic shit like sparrows and ships. Is there a way to get any of the new Shadowkeep ships and sparrows other than paying silver for the weekly offerings from Tess?
---
It stands out less in the crucible than in PvE, but yes it's at the level where all other exotics deserve to be at as well.
---
I don‚Äôt even know how to start the vex offensives
---
Its gonna be on the daily rotation
---
What is dead may never die.
---
I appreciate a good pun.
---
This is a good pun.
---
I wasn't quick enough with the switch, so I'm just replaying the age campaign for screenshot opportunities.
---
Recluse
---
Someone please find a fix for this üò©
---
Spiders bounties no longer give glimmer
---
Sarah connor?
---
No matter what they do there will always be people like you saying this kind of stuff
---
Talk to the ship cowgirl (no hate Amanda's one of my favorites, up there with clyde God rest his soul)
---
Agreed. Doesn't mean we are wrong though.
---
Praise be to solo queue! Last season, I was a trapped in a heroic III loop and eventually lost interest in recluse. Finally worked up the spirit to step back into comp today and boy let me tell you. I went from 0 to 2078 (while keeping my streaks between 3-5) in about 2 and am happily waiting for tomorrow‚Äôs reset. I highly recommend going for it.
---
Damn. I‚Äôve run it 5 times at 920 and got 0 exotics
---
stupteid bullying aliens
---
Nice
---
DlCs don't need to be rushed?
---
Tell me to slow down and do it at a medium pace.
---
Was having the same problem today, it seemed like some of my shots simply weren‚Äôt doing any damage, I can‚Äôt really explain it very well
---
I was always counterbalance stock until these anti barrier rounds came out. Holy crap does that thing do work in the Vex Offensive!
---
No they are broken, they e been disabled for a few days now.
---
Congrats man. I just finished my breakneck and exit strategy today. I‚Äôm about tackle this beast next. How are you liking the gun so far?
---
Only pc unfortunately. You need to add destiny fonts to windows character map and copy paste into steam name.
---
Imagine a ice titan
---
On phone. Upvotes to the right.
---
Playing crucible is one of the best ways to increase your power,  win or lose. IMO, also the best easy to get exotics.
---
I guess my perception of cost/value in Destiny has become somewhat antiquated. If it's comparatively cheap to pick an item to purchase directly, then I'll just have to get more used to the game.
---
It was way harder in previous seasons without new lighters
---
I‚Äôve found at least 2 already, not if if anymore of them have it, I‚Äôd have to check
---
&lt;sigh&gt;......Exit Strategy is next on my list. Need a break though. This gun is okay. It‚Äôs basically a solar 21% Delirium. Not sure if it was worth the grind but,eh, it‚Äôs done now.
---
I‚Äôm not sure then sorry
---
Btw thanks a lot
---
You could probably look up a guide on YouTube
---
 &lt;sigh&gt;......Exit Strategy is next on my list. Need a break though. This gun is okay. It‚Äôs basically a solar 21% Delirium. Not sure if it was worth the grind but,eh, it‚Äôs done now.
---
Discord and the destiny app can help with that
---
Hi all, I have an issue with the Ornament system. I cannot for the life of me work out how to do it. Im currently level 902 and I go into the appearance for my gear and there are no other gear items within the appearance tab to select to change it to. 
---
Is there a quest I need to do? Everything I've read seems to say stuff should just be there? Is it a bug?
---
We should be rewarded a skin for it.
---
Tell us more in detail what weapons guardian.
---
Doesn‚Äôt it cost like 15 legendary shards, 10 planetary mats and some glimmer? Thats not very much at all.
---
Did you pick the Legacy Quests up? Because they‚Äôre what give players the option to replay all previous story content before Shadowkeep.
---
No. Go to the tower in your directory and view vendors like Zavala, Ikora, and Hawthorne. Underneath their character description it should say ‚ÄúChallenges, WEEKLY-Complete bounties.‚Äù 
---
You will need to complete 8 bounties given by that vendor to complete the challenge.
---
I‚Äôm at 4500, going for not forgotten. Last season my best was 3200, and I‚Äôve already smashed it. Comp is so much easier now;)
---
It's the last mission from the blue missions on io
---
Was the above message a joke? About half of it was true.
---
And once I got to play today, I pulled it from my collections and I killed Ghaul with it. Tomorrow, Panoptes. Eventually, I'll play through Crown of Sorrow with it too.
---
I would check the integrity of the game files through steam. If that doesn't work you'll probably have to reinstall
---
Keep all exotics I assume?
---
Not hard, I got it in 8 hrs. I also hammered 56 matches in a row... I don't recommend it.
---
I would. Armor will drop with randomly rolled stats that will be better than if you reaqquire them from collections. Weapons it doesn‚Äôt really matter, but destiny is a collection game so I figure keeping them makes sense
---
I tried to matchmake in orbit and it was evaluating guardians, after that when the strike loads im alone lol.
---
The bow is the Le Monarque
---
Definitely, losing matches took away like 3-10 glory at a time and winning gave 80-100
---
I'm guessing because Leviathan is included in New Light but Last whish comes with Forsaken?
---
Where is Xer this week?
---
I don‚Äòt think so. All the streamers can reach the lvl, i mean that is their job. But why give bungie not a week more time before raid start, so way more people (teams) can try the worlds first? It‚Äòs more funny to see a worlds first run with 1000 teams then like now at around 100 or so...
---
PvP matchmaking is kinda jacked at the moment. You were getting put with people way below your level, it shows in their k/d
---
‚ÄúHead to the new Bergusia forge to complete the next leg of the quest. Players will need to ignite the forge with Maximum Temper. To do this, destroy the two drones that spawn during the second wave. One drone circles the red pipes at the back and the other drone circles the pillar near the broken landing up the back. Open the cache after completing the third round to acquire the key. Learn the layout of this forge, as it's where the final step takes place as part of the Lock and Key quest‚Äù you will have to wait for the Bergusia forge to rotate in.
---
It does get very hard tho, up here, u lost around 60 per loss, maybe more, and like, 100 per win
---
Yooo same, I wanna look cool with my armor instead of looking like I just put a bunch of clothes on.
---
Replace the V in vex with an Süò≥üò≥üò≥üò≥üòéüòéüòéüòé(it sais s*x)
---
Equip a different super for ten minutes
---
"Alexa but meth" is my favorite
---
Yea no problem lol, I was confused when I first bought it but, bungie will always add the content through updates, you just have to buy it to access it
---
Any exotics you acquire from quest or the field
---
What????? Not even close.
---
I can kill with melee hits a big group of enemies jumping around. They dont want to kill me though. Is this hardcore you are talking about ? :)
---
It‚Äôs not the clearest of instructions I‚Äôll say that much
---
I think you may have double posted.
---
If you've got delirium, this one is irrelevant tbh. Delirium is much better.
---
To be honest, the simplest mechanically is Scourge of the Past. It‚Äôs also, in my opinion, the coolest thematically. Threat Level is also one of the best guns in the game. Plus a chance (admittedly very small) to get Anarchy. All that and it‚Äôs actually quite short so I good way to ease in. 
---
Leviathan is also pretty good. Relatively simple but it‚Äôs a bit longer and the rewards aren‚Äôt as good given that all the weapons are year 1. Still a great experience, definitely do it. But, from experience, I probably wouldn‚Äôt have it as my priority.
---
Nobody said ‚Äúleads to nothing.‚Äù They said they‚Äôre gonna do more with it later. And they will. We‚Äôre looking at 5-6 more years of Destiny at least.
---
Yeah I accidentally did, my trash phone and trash internet will do that
---
Kk
---
Lmao ... how is this so perfect
---
Go talk to Lord Shaxx. Hes in the courtyard at the Tower. You get the crucible bounties from him.
---
Hey how did you check your ping?
---
Keep equipping high light rates u till you hit 900. Around then you'll be keeping your gear and infusing it up from there
---
You might be a little confused on what hardcore mmo means, difficulty spikes are on the raids, swords nightfalls, and other heroic encounters. Hardcore mmo refers to the fact that you get out what time you put in. No one said the game was difficult, probably just not your cup of tea my guy
---
I haven't played the new expansion but there used to be an item available from Tess everis that increased exp gains and loot. I think it was called a fireteam token. Check and see if she's got it available still?
---
Those aren't the same models
---
The Boy has got a corn cob up his ass!!üòÇüòò
---
Philips Hue Play Lightbar + Phillips Bridge (is needed). There is a free official app that finally worked with adaptive sync (otherwise it was a stuttery mess playing) but also open source alternatives.
---
Im not sure what you mean by curved but heres my friend code
---
82090074
---
You got 2 years to play d2 theres no need for a bonus.
---
Pretty sure any Word Drop exotic can appear.
---
Even though Monte Carlo isn't on here, I still got it from mine.
---
im pretty sure they got rid of those. i remember getting rid of alot of the old xp boost stuff since the battle pass increases xp now
---
Yeah I know there's 3 that drop from the hunts, I got and completed those, and the 5 for the armor. But ur saying obscurity, greed, brutality, and vanity are simply random drops?
---
Dude you just started playing. Last season was much harder when como was still trash.
---
Oh neat cheers dude!
---
That‚Äôs all irrelevant now
---
How?
---
Are you on Xbox one? If so, do you mind playing alongside new players?
---
Lag
---
Levels are gone now. There‚Äôs only power level. Every player of destiny 2 starts at power 750 with no xp level anymore
---
How ironic üòÇü§™ lol a rabbit that doesn't know what bunny's like!
---
Probably. Watch the countdown on the bottom left closely, it goes from 6 to 7 and back to 6. That‚Äôs when the ogre seems to notice he‚Äôs being attacked
---
Australia mate. Can be pretty fucked.
---
The monitor was a steal a couple of months back. Amazon Germany sold it for 330‚Ç¨. Official price is 550$ and I would never pay such an amount for a monitor. 
---
The HDR is only 400 but I rarely use it anyway. I give it a 9/10 because I hate OSD menus without joysticks. :D
---
I has played WoW around 9 years with breaks. Now playin Teso and Gw2 from time to time. Are they hardcore mmo how do you think?
---
I'm new player, and I'm considering buying forsaken and/or shadowkeep DLC. Do I get something more if I buy shadowkeep in pre-order? Should I get forsaken from get-go, or is it more focused on endgame stuff? How powerful are items and subclasses/supers from forsaken compared to new light?
---
oh yeah EP. So its not good anymore really D: ?
---
um, you have all the time you want. thats only if you're going to be a nolifer and binge all the content and raid day 1. You can actually play at any pace and then raid when you are ready. They release the raid in 4 days so that those full time d2 players can raid. not so that everybody has to do the raid. lol failpost
---
It exotic tho
---
Oh yeah I just seen mr fruit video about this weapon omg its so amazing!
---
Yeah well all my Exotics have been doing literally nothing. If one exotic can one shot someone inside of a well that gives you so much regeneration you're nearly immortal, even if that is debuffed in The Crucible, it should not one shot you.
---
How? just talk to Shaxx i guess
---
Use LFG or use the specified reddit for finding fireteams.
---
I think that is how you get the quest
---
Lordy
---
"181,598 people on the planet and I have two friends."
---
I do the same. I seem to get completely fucked in that strike specifically more than any other.
---
My apologies but ‚ÄúKO‚Äù? I might just be drawing a blank but what is it?
---
Is this some kind of omega joke I'm too alpha to understand? 
---
This comment was made my the one shot bow club
---
Go to Amanda Holliday in the Hangar of the Tower and you can pick up the legacy quests that you might have already progressed through. Your progress is reset, but that's your best bet for story. A lot of the content after that seems to be non-story related, or locked behind DLC.
---
That is how you get the quest
---
If Asher has cut out, then he's throwing a tantrum and broken his microphone
---
Thx
---
Im just blind then since i did look, Thanks!
---
...Who's up next?
---
I usually just help out by reviving other players
---
Yes
---
I see it here and there but if you‚Äôre going for raw damage you‚Äôre better off grinding for a grenade launcher that has spike grenades. EP shotgun can still melt if you have the right build
---
I believe it's called the mouth of babes?
---
The bit with the ogres/shriekers and the jumping puzzle bit with the flying debris is the most obnoxious thing ever.
---
I mean I was mainly joking. There are definitely some exotics that are more op than others, but in my opinion an exotic should be powerful enough to do substantial super damage with a single shot (special and heavy). And should outshine legendary weapons in the same or similar class. The toaster could probably be brought down a little bit, but I love it in most game modes, so I'm not trying to say anything
---
Can you pm me a link?
---
cool, thanks.
---
Yeah, that's correct.
---
I usually am ok with the ogre, the shrieker will fuck me up if I don't have a mid-long range weapon, but the second I have anything better than a hand cannon, they don't pay attention to me. And the boss throwing you in the air pisses me off
---
bruh all of d2 is just recycled d1
---
Rest easy, it'll be nerfed this season.
---
As Arkzora also stated, this is clearly not OP's use case and he entirely could activate windows. Within that video it is even mentioned that you can get "grey market" keys. Most of those keys are OEM keys ripped from scrapped machines which arent against the EULA I believe as it is the same as migrating after hardware failure. 
---
No excuses, activate your windows.
---
Thought it was obvious? You need to *git gud* lol
---
That‚Äôs the one.
---
Crucible is pvp, players fight each other so live with it, you‚Äôre trying to use a heavy that has one shot per brick, heavy is always desired so majority deviate to get it, hunters are more popular for pvp, titans have OEM and shoulder charge that I‚Äôm surprised hasn‚Äôt been mentioned but I mean character means nothing if it‚Äôs only the gun that did the damage and a normal melee attack, imagine being killed by a mida or sniper from range a hunter didn‚Äôt do that a player with a gun did that.
---
You can‚Äôt gamshare dlc.
---
Will go find him next time i log in then
---
yeah, you can my friend does it with his friend
---
Awesome. Just FYI, he leaves today at reset.
---
These games without an audience is awkward
---
It's either feeding frenzy or field prep in the first slot and rampage or demolitionist in the second slot. With field prep it holds over 400 rounds
---
*Cries in scorn.*
---
Which new strike
---
Im also hoping that bungie might look at my idea i had for an exotic bow it would have unlimited ammo fire three arrows in a fan but it could have some crazy exotic questline for it to unlock it
---
need that catalyst so bad!
---
Here, look
---
http://www.gamersheroes.com/game-guides/destiny-2-lost-sectors-guide-earth-european-dead-zone/
---
Sure, I‚Äôll give my account info to a random stranger of Reddit. Yeah, no.
---
I just need to vent dude, as far as I have seen every Hunter I've played against has done the same thing all the time. Never have I been in a game where it feels like the odds are even I can't get a foothold, and when I do it's always a game that doesn't have hunters in it, or at least very few of them
---
its ur season rank
---
Looks like ill catch him friday then
---
A lot of ornaments change the whole look of the gun not just the color
---
if not interested then move on, bye:)
---
Forges now launch from the Earth Map, bottom left corner. They are now rotate daily (Volundr -&gt; Gofannon -&gt; Izanami -&gt; Bergusia I think). Everyone has access to them, the quests to 'discover' the forges has been removed. Frames are located in your Quest tab in the items on the left hand side.
---
Xur is a vendor who comes around every weekend, starting from daily reset on friday and leaving on daily reset on tuesday. He sells a random exotic weapon and a random piece of exotic armor for each class each week. 
---
For example, this week he is selling Wardcliff Coil for the gun (A MUST get, snag it before noon CST!) and Nezarecs Sin for Warlocks, Feedback Fence for Titans, and Sixth Coyote for hunters. 
---
On top of that, you can buy a fated engram from him which has "bad luck protection" AKA if you have an exotic already and you're also missing an exotic, you will 100% get an exotic you're missing.
---
Thank you!
---
FYI there is also an app for locating xur, where you can vote on what exotics you would like and all so see what he has for sale before getting to him
---
If you do the public event you come across while doing the risk/reward mission 3 times you'll get khvostov the shell and the ship
---
U can go to the seasons tab in ur map abd claim rewards there. Also it gives you up to 12 additional power in the season artifact

I tried to change the Language, but after switching to Japanese for example, i was not able to change the subtitle. Do i need to add a Startcommand to steam?

Festering Core in Io

I got two frames, but the one ADA gives you for a quest, I think it's a machine gun? That isnt popping up. But it doesnt matter, just have to google where to find the drones and I'm good, so thanks :)
---
Im not new, left after Forsaken and I stupidly deleted my Warlock and Titan just before SK in a bid to stop me getting too sucked in with multiple characters (limited play time issue), but here I am getting sucked in again and wanting to play bubble Titan  (my main from D1) ü§£

Thanks for quick response, so glad dont have to go through it again üëç

When eris said "I sent a guardian to kill omnighul" I blurted out "yeah that was me..." worst part of PC is your treated like a kindergaudian.
---
nice
---
-Confused Computer Beeps-
---
I thought the same thing when I heard that. I stopped and was like "aw eris thanks bud!" Lol. It was nice to hear
---
I hadn't even heard of the Monte Carlo until a friend was talking about it yesterday. 10 min later on first loot mob I kill on Nessus, BAM! Exotic and it's the MC. I do like it. 'Specially for punchy builds.
---
"Nope" because omnighul was terrible in D1.
---
I feelZ ya bro, last raid I did was kings fall
---
Well, mine works just fine
---
No it can't, I tried
---
F
---
Edited! Thank you, didn't think about that
---
Ps plus and f2p are same. U also dont need to have ps plus to play f2p version, but if you buy any dlc, u ll have to own ps plus to play them. F2p version of the game contains 2 dlc for free, but there is also Forsaken dlc before shadowkeep, that you have to buy. If you are new, just do the main quest. Also you can complete story mode, that starts from Amanda Holliday in the Tower
---
Oh man I feel ya. Our crew hasn't done a raid since Leviathan, then one of us got sick and sadly passed away. We haven't raised since and I miss it a lot.
---
Ah, a man from my other post! It wasn't there for me man, looks like I'll have to do Risk/Reward :/
---
Thanks for the quick tip dude!
---
I don't know if it works, but setting yourself to appear online in steam, might help?
---
I don't have enough space on my Xbox to download it ,_,

Im at rank 29, still got a while

I played destiny 2 following its release in 2017 on the disc version. When I heard it was going free to play I decide to return hoping I could continue where I left off in late 2018. I had gotten my character to level 50. Now playing new light I have spawned in with my character from 2018 and I can‚Äôt continue with my last quest. To do this should I get the disc version for cheap and then get the dlc add ons from Xbox store. Or shall I just use new light which is confusing
---
I wasn‚Äôt complaining I just found it funny that someone had the same viewpoint as me, thought it was ridiculous to see KWTD posts flooding the LFG‚Äôs for a brand new raid lol it‚Äôs like nobody‚Äôs even entertaining the idea of teaching newbies, but I get it some people only have a few hours.
---
What‚Äôs the Risk/Reward mission?
---
Nice.
---
Watch a youtube video and join a Sherpa raid team.
---
Been trying to get my friends to get it since it‚Äôs free I convinced one to get it and one to redownload it after he left Y1.
---
Woa, bit of aggression, eh? I've used up all my character slots and even though I said I would, people aren't't always to keen on deleting their characters, you can get very attached to Guardians ya' know.
---
Looks like an album cover
---
I made sure all my dreambane gear was ornamented with the Vanguard Dare set. Definitely looked fly in that final cutscene.

It's certainly easier to use (the Master of Arms buff makes the bodyshot damage = the precision damage), but IMO the KO is much more versatile in PvE. In PvP recluse still shreds, though.
---
I already did, but I could still see my online friends in the ingame friend list. So I thought they could still see me online. Not sure if this is a glitch, a feature, or both.
---
*Excalibur wants to talk with you*
---
I‚Äôve wanted to do a raid for a while, maybe we can go together! I‚Äôm on ps4 I just need to get shadowkeep and get my power level up haha. I‚Äôm a lil late to the game but I‚Äôm getting there
---
The Recluse lost \~10% range and didn't get as big a buff as the other weapons.
---
there should be an option to start from 0 and be forced to play all the missions for the beginning and progress like it was when the game released in 2017. Starting lvl 750 and everything is open makes the game feels uselss for new players.
---
Correct, though you still have to have that half bar filled in or you cannot perform a finisher if you do not have enough energy to do it.
---
Titan and proud.
---
Nostalgia! But the graphics in the new cosmodrome feel more crisp
---
The earth locations are so far apart.
---
I think your Ghost should be a more significant character as well, although D2 ofcourse isn't a visual novel, deciding what to say and changing the outcome at times (failing) would be very interesting.
---
Are you a new player or have you been playing a while? Because I have no idea when you get the quest if you just started.
---
If you've already been playing before shadowkeep, it's the exotic quest line Banshee gives you, the last step is called risk/reward and you have to go back to the cosmodrome to get weapon parts that'll give you the Risk runner and its catalyst.
---
No you don't snort meth
---
But after a while wouldn't all the newbies learn and it would just become like an extra long strike?
---
So... you need to get a fire team.. then set up the 5 off swords to have maximum handicap against you. And some modifiers. I think my buddies and I used blackout and void singe.
---
Then kill everything very quickly without dying.
---
Any suggestion for what class to choose?
---
Okay great. I'll do a loop around the vendors and pick up any quests they might have.
---
Thanks for all your help!
---
Looks like the Huckelberry to me.
---
I mean..... There are 3 slots for one of each. But if you are asking what to main, well, Hunter master race.
---
Delete your recluse and your foetracer and you will never be cancer
---
I get there are extenuating circumstances but on many of the games I play (Div2/Destiny2) I never get the people that play and say ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt do the raid I don‚Äôt have people to play with‚Äô, if you have the right guns and light level, use an LFG, get a Sherpa if you‚Äôre not 100% on what you‚Äôre doing.
---
Do the missions give you a good amount of xp like shadowkeep? It could be a worth farming if it resets
---
This raid is drastically more complicated than Scourge though. Scourge isn't even that complicated.
---
I'd say it's probably more complicated than Crown too, but I need to play it more to say for sure.
---
And good luck getting the blueberries on LFG to do the puzzles for the quest. Even if they watch Datto's video 100 times they'll still probably fuck it up and then the one guy who hasn't been talking the whole time will leave and then everyone else will leave and you'll be alone again
---
n o
---
Talks a lot of shit for being a floating ball of light
---
Yo that is metal as fuck
---
I think your thinking of forsaken exotics as I know they put those in the loot pool for xur. Remember when he sold One Eyed Mask with enhanced hand cannon targeting? Oh god. What a weekend
---
I feel dumb now
---
Is it better than 21% Delirium?
---
If you look closely they aren't all exactly the same. Some of them at the bottom are a little more damage then some closer to the top.
---
Yeah but then it comes and finds you.
---
Maining is a silly concept in this game. Each class offers advantages in different areas. Titans are PVP monsters. I keep all three classes and cycle for weekly rewards constantly.
---
Good thing Hawthorne now sells Raid Banners in sets of 10
---
I honestly stopped playing crucible since shadowkeep. With all these range nerfs I never know where I'm getting shot from and by the time I find them they already 2 bursted me with a pulse. I'd rather have the previous sandbox.
---
Thanks, they're my favorite.
---
Possibly their own grenade, or they had a friend shoot them?
---
I don't know if it was him, but the dude probably had a certain amount of resilience and hit a laser multiple time with different health regen setting.
---
Time is the real enemy. Don‚Äôt raids take a good couple hours off game time?
---
actually you can
---
There are gazillion people just like you and they all use Lfg. It's 2019 bro, you don't need friends anymore.
---
Maybe they just don't have hair dye and plastic surgeons in the future.  Interplanetary travel and guns that shoot coalesced dark energy, sure, but a box of hair dye?  Nah, too hard.
---
I rarely fucking get the hallowed lair
---
And the LFG channel sucks major balls. After just 1 day after World's First, 80% of groups are asking for experienced players only and or full pinnacle gear with Izunagi's Burden (Which btw after Shadowkeep launched was impossible to obtain and still is due to the Forge rotation).
---
???????????????????????????
---
Legit feck off with that noise.
---
Completely agree, im still in the hub picking up random quests,bounties,weekly/monthly/dailies etc, no idea where to go.
---
Quests say kill x amount of something or do "insert random name here" quest or challenge? Ive got no clue.
---
Apparently you can select a bunch of different planets? Which one should i be going to first? Who knows.
---
I just want a guide that says "pick this quest from this npc/area, then travel to this planet and do this in this area of the planet to progress".
---
How do you get that emote lol I wants it!
---
I'm still very new to the game but I've seen a couple of these posts now, what's the significance of that particular number? Older content reference or something?
---
I was scrolling through and my first thought wasn't "That's a real picture", it was "I better put my banner down".
---
Too relatable, few of the friends stuck after Forsaken and now that Ive moved to PC I literally have 1 friend in my list.
---
Nope it included in new light
---
So you shouldn't use them?? Lmao
---
I havent gotten an exotic yet other that the hand cannon :(
---
Just use the Destiny App? Helps you setup raids, strikes, and even teams for crucible. Gets you posting times, how many are needed. Some want newbies to help others want experienced raiders.
---
I'm not new by any stretch, but I'm only a hunter main, what tier on the super chart is that?
---
Only thing I like about him is his patrols on the Moon are a breeze.
---
Newb question: how do I create a bubble with the Titan? I looked into the subclass and all I got is the shield.
---
Yeah JUST get over your fear dude. JUST be yourself.
---
Fucking normies.
---
I was wondering how you'd show that. I guess you couple open a private crucible match with a buddy and have them do 1 body shot with the same gun while you swap through the gear.
---
Forsaken owners/ anyone who didn't get them at all in y2 like me with Jotunn
---
That's the most Titan thing I've seen since I started playing.
---
Yeah you can snort anything it's just not recommended
---
yeah its the average of all your armor and weapons
---
That's cancer
---
What's this exotic called?
---
I feel you. Im currently trying to find a new clan because of my schedule and life i dont get to play much but when i do i wanna accomplish everything possible. But none of my friends play anymore because d2 was such a disappointment  but now i have nobody to play with lol
---
Same! Good work! And to the haters ‚Äúa single grain of rice can tip the scale‚Äù
---
Comp is easier this season it seams.
---
It's the top tree and you have to hold both bumpers if you're in console.
---
Me trying to look good so in the final cutscene the Darkness looks good as well
---
Like a lot of others on this thread I have recluse and don't even like to use it in PvP. I'd much rather have last word or a shotgun for a close range option.
---
The thing I wish got nerfed this season but didn't was Erentil, still can map you in 1 hit.
---
Then make your own post..
---
The last city part is close enough
---
Resilience is massively less useful.
---
Your guardian has 70 health and a base of 115 armor, for a total of 185 effective health. Pushing your resilience to 10 literally only boosts your shield value to 130, giving you 200 effective health.
---
In comparison, OEMs shield adds 95 iirc..
---
Ahhh cool thanks
---
If you have the top tree (only) you hold your super button instead of just pressing it
---
I REALLY wanna do the raid, but the rest of my friends keep delaying me. Every time they say ‚Äúlet‚Äôs do it this night‚Äù but every time there‚Äôs one person who‚Äôs not there. Last time a new raid came and I‚Äôve done it with random people from the community they got really upset at me.
---
Every finisher kill in pve not melee it turns you invis on melee in pvp and while that is a reward for beating the campaign it is not what this email is referring to
---
Damn, now im sad, and i didnt even play d1
---
The jump.
---
That raid is probably the most beautiful thing ever.
---
"unsafe vex gives you harpies", saw that one a while ago
---
My steam I'd if I die this properly. STEAM_0:0:63731334

Lose less glory than ever before and gain TONS per win. Your welcome
---
I was hoping for faction ornaments as well. Seems stupid that they missed all those out also. But I suppose that need to have that armour for it. Same as sword flight for those ornaments.
---
Good spot to grind masterworks
---
And that‚Äôs how the vex transform planets into giant machines 
---
Thanks for coming to my TED talk
---
It's currently survival if in not mistaken but points are in red and not in orange
---
Nice bank shot fam.
---
Hope this helps
---
Use it well!
---
Nice, that makes sense, much appreciated partner!
---
I get your pain, I got lucky and got into a raid heavy clan that got me out of my bubble.
---
Check out r/destinysherpa it has a fantastic community
---
So im almost positive back in the early days of d1 people calculated the angles of Shadow and a whole bunch of other things that the last city was in South America. It really doesn't make sense tho. Europe is a lot more plausible
---
I can relate to this so hard it hurts. Seriously, if any PC people are looking for someone to play with, message me. I definitely need more destiny friends.
---
What platform you on? Ok on Xbox and a couple friend and I are looking to hit up the new raid around 7:30-8pm ( start time also central ) Saturday.
---
Izanagi‚Äôs burden is definitely still obtainable as I‚Äôve been doing the quest this week
---
I think he‚Äôs talking about the symbols in people‚Äôs names
---
LFG should be somewhat easier with all the new players
---
Same, sort of.... but also I don‚Äôt really like raids anyway. The mechanics are convoluted and with LFG take forever. Only D2 raid I‚Äôve completed is Leviathan. Spent 7 hours once to make it to Riven and not finish.
---
It's there in the destiny_symbols_ps4.otf file
---
You can't have your cake and eat it too
---
If they just add matchmaking for raids it simply solves
---
Tommy86 yes that would be the very first thing :) A side note, how do i reply to my comment replies? It just shows ... share and another thing, no reply icon....with how much I'm on reddit i feel kinda dumb on not knowing this. (face palm!)
---
Just make sure you keep building sick 90's on that bot of a boss to get that victory royale.
---
That‚Äôs not an excuse, as that‚Äôs not every team. I see a lot of lower ones with people that‚Äôs say just ‚Äúbe chill.‚Äù Also, make your own. I think at this point people just need to get over the social anxiety part and jump in.
---
I wouldn't even mind these cosmetics, but I would like the bright engrams on level up... 
---
But removed ... Sadly...
---
im really into the game so far. not sure why i waited for so long. i was actually playing warframe a few years back....literally stole everything from D2 and D2 does all of it 1000x better...
---
The recluse which is obtained from reaching 2100 points in competitive
---
In a game where randoms can‚Äôt make a public event heroic and can‚Äôt do a forge where the only mechanic is to throw a ball at it? Yes.
---
Accurate
---
Unfortunately yes. But you'll find that equipping the strongest weapons from your other characters onto your new ones makes their entire story grind and light grind a lot faster and more enjoyable. Obviously you can also skip most cutscenes on a second go around.
---
Good luck coordinating any part of last wish without any communication. Who's grabbing crystals and plates? what if you need to swap plates on the fly? Or even better, how are you doing the vault?
---
It is regular German, not a Swiss dialect.
---
Ah an overlord reference. Nice
---
I don‚Äôt see why we need to deny people access from playing raids solo with other solo players. Slamming your head into a wall and being frustrated should be the players choice.
---
It‚Äôs impossible to fail at menagerie it‚Äôs easier than a strike.
---
Absolutely! Really good timing. I said it someone else, but I thought this exotic was a cheap bersion of Wormhusk, and oh boy was I wrong. I'm definitely a fan of this blessing to hunters lol
---
I like Asher Mir too. He seems to hate everyone but one time I heard him say he should show his appreciation to Ikora for being pretty much the only one to be supportive to him after his accident. Also Asher is also friends with Eris. He gave her research on the hive (you can guess Asher did it for her because he‚Äôs a vex maniac) at dawning idk which year tho.
---
God i understand you
---
What sucks is i had a really great group on xbox one on d1, but had to sell the xbox and when d2 launched i got it for pc and found no one to play, i actually got through leviathan once with random people, but it just wasn't the same, ended up dropping the game
---
Now i got back and i'm trying again, but it sucks trying to find not just random people but actually a great group where i get to know the people i'm playing with, cetainly doesn't help that my irl friends that play on pc doesn't want to play destiny
---
Because raids can‚Äôt be done with unprepared randoms that aren‚Äôt talking.
---
I just got my and I love it
---
As a xbox/pc player I feel you on not getting trace exotic right away üòï
---
Agree to disagree. I don't believe they should lock the best pve weapon behind competitive pvp. This opinion is completely independent of my own capability to acquire it because I know I can
---
Ah a fellow titan
---
The OP of this thread is asking about matchmaking, so that's what we are discussing. Which words did you not understand from that?
---
As a art college graduate, I can safely say, that this is the best work I've ever seen by far. I am in awe.
---
Look for Sherpas. They are players that are experienced in raids and teach people how to go through them.
---
So far, I've had good experiences with these groups. Everyone is chill and patient because everyone is either new to the experience or to the particular raid. And as long as you do the bare minimum communication needed for any particular encounter it's all good.
---
Coming from someone that also is averse to speaking to online strangers, this does help a little to "loosen up" so to speak
---
100% this
---
Streamers know the mechanics by heart and are experts at doing raids because it‚Äôs their jobs. They aren‚Äôt three underleveled randoms with no mics.
---
But can you put anti barrier rounds on huckleberry? üòè
---
Yeah it makes me sad especially because I pay alot of attention to how I look and customization is huge for me. The trials chest ornement is my favorite one and I had the chest plate it went to but I dismantled it and it never got put in to my collections I got kinda screwed over
---
And I don‚Äôt have the DLC
---
RIP dead orbit tokens
---
That‚Äôs what lfg is for m8, to find a group to consistently raid with
---
Literally doesn't matter, the only thing specs would do is say "Oh yeah that's bad don't play the game"
---
The more common gear in destiny was leagues better. I remember purposely decking my titan out with knives everywhere
---
The only way to overcome social anxiety is to interact with others
---
I remember when I was 14 and found drug and sex jokes funny.
---
Recovery is better in PVE but in PVP resilience is waaay better since it can allow you to survive another shot, two if it's a low damage gun.

First answer from RFormica. I knew I remembered something about actual places' names.
---
Join a clan there are many out there needing new players for raids and other content. Pm me if you need a clan for EU on pc.
---
I'm not even of light to attempt the new raid yet.
---
*cries in 918 light ;_;*
---
I feel like moving target is pretty useless on a GL. Personally I‚Äôm not looking down sights too often when using one.
---
&gt; In a game where randoms can‚Äôt make a public event heroic
---
Why do you surtain that people don't know how to make them heroic? A lot of times I have just a quest for 2 events and I don't want to waste my time so I blast through it without heroic. I am not alone who does that that's for sure.
---
&gt; can‚Äôt do a forge where the only mechanic is to throw a ball at it?
---
I have not failed literally a single forge in my whole playtime. Not one. How did you managed to fail so miserably?
---
You just talking nonsense. LFG works, and even if it doesn't - it does not affect you, you can choose to not use them.
---
I believe you meant that reply for the person above me
---
This is a big ooof. Sorry man
---
I don't mind the strike on a basic level, but it just feels a lot longer to complete than others.
---
So ive gotten the forsaken dlc, but I don't know how to access the forge activity? Do I have to complete the story for forsaken before I can do that?
---
Yeah we did this accidentally when I just threw a smoke to slow him and he fell to his death
---
 Do you know if nezerak works with void weapons or only abilities?
---
There is a paragon mod for 2.0 armor as well you just have to fond one in the wild.
---
folks say to go to tower and back to orbit or relog.
---
Should I buy shadowkeep and play current content first or continue with f2p and play out everything else before purchasing?
---
Ok thanks y‚Äôall.
---
I fucking lost my shit when during my play through, my titan said  "Toland says I should bring an intellectual, so I'm here to punch the warlock and bring him our hunter instead".
---
Chill out Janga. I think you should know when you do the crucible, all the power levels are cancelled out. Yes people that are veterans have optimized guns and armor but I was pvp'ing with a new character at lv750 getting kills!
---
Same thing happened to me, sometimes it takes a bit to register. I‚Äôm guessing in the game you reached fabled it didn‚Äôt do the rank up package thing? If so just go do a few patrols and return to orbit or something.
---
r/woosh
---
Rep muh city!!!  PSN Witty43
---
Oh come on at least one of you has a banner
---
I don‚Äôt exactly remember I‚Äôve been throwing my life away raiding and playing crucible so ye
---
What evidence exactly?
---
I ran vault of glass about a hundred times back in the good ole days. In Destiny 2 i've never done a single raid. Idk what happened.
---
You can do all of that without communicating lol, i dont see where chattering into a mic does dps to any raid bosses. If you know how to do the raid you dont need to talk. Will it be harder? Yes. Will it be impossible? No. 
---
I think you think this game is much harder than it is.
---
PC player here, and me and my clan would be willing to sherpa any new players through raids that want to try them! The only requirment is that you have patience and a mic. We have completed every raid under the sun (save for GoS, still working on that one) and are always willing to run one of them
---
My friend's confused by what's going on here. How should I explain it to him?
---
You probably didn't do Volundr forge. The quest on the map of the EDZ is on a daily rotation. So everyday another forge is featured. You have to wait until it is Volundr which is probably tomorrow.
---
Wait which wall is this? Because in the tower, there‚Äôs writing in a variety of languages, including Chinese.
---
They changed it to where shattered throne is always available to play regardless of the week
---
Just go LFG
---
You are a godsend.
---
You‚Äôre moms house haha gottem help my friends have left
---
I'm waiting for the the day a titan just climbs a crane and doesn't come down because he really wants to protest something
---
Are you complaining?
---
I guess this works well because you can change your weapons around to ensure your light keeps going up on the weapon side, then just pick up gear from any area vendor at that same light level.
---
Oh sick
---
If you want to follow the story just do the quests with a red marker on them.
---
How big is your clan?  I am in need of a clan again, especially one that raids and isn't full of high school kids.
---
System? Level?
---
What makes Europe more plausible?

do you get anything past 100?

Last City is in Nepal

DAMNNNNN

r/dataisbeautiful
---
Well, how to kill ‚Äúgatelords‚Äù?
---
Same here man everyone on lfg for the most part wants people who have ran the raid 30+ times. Where my clan literally consists of me and 2 of my friends. We all work so there isn't a good time for any of us to sit down and grind for 4-6 hours learning mechanics on everything. We had lfg'd for the last wish and it was a nightmare. Guys who had joined kept getting pissed off at a few of the people that were with us because they couldn't get some of the mechanics correctly &amp; it got to the point of no return cause everyone was frustrated, we couldn't keep anyone in the fireteam who knew what they were doing because of this. So we just don't raid anymore because of the toxic players that are in this community.
---
Yeah :/ I know what you mean. I'm gonna level up my hunter to 950 before I claim the solstice armor on them and see if it makes a difference
---
I havnt seen anything with red marks. But i do have story ones
---
The time I heard them I almost fell out of my seat.
---
whose the gentleman in the meme? I see this face in a lot of memes and am curious of whom the person is irl. 
---
thanks!
---
Did you do the Black Armory Key mold quest?
---
lol
---
Speak to Amanda in the hanger at the tower and she will give you the older story quests
---
Guys, find a clan. Not just a clan but one that's open to new people and accepting. I used to sherpa people through raids on D1. I loved teaching new people the raid it was fun. If you can find a chill group of people it makes all the difference. I think only the elitist gamers would get mad at you for not understanding what to do next. Most regular people hate that attitude. Gaming should be inclusive and enjoyable. If you don't understand a step in the progression of the raid, taking 5 minutes to explain a new step isn't that long and you shouldn't feel bad or stupid for asking. If you don't know something how are you going to learn it without asking how it's done in different ways until it's explained in a way you understand.
---
I hope that made sense. Don't let your fears hold you back from enjoying some of the funnest most challenging content in the game... not to mention rewarding.
---
Honestly to this day I'm not really sure where I go in the UI or where in general to lfg lol.
---
Well except Hawthorne gives you a ship and tells you that you have a long way to go to the farm, even by flying standards
---
In the lore she even states she wishes she could have gotten to the city quicker, but she was too far for her ships and was simply left to scouting overhead looking for survivors
---
This is the same problem I've had, luckily now that New Light exists I'm gonna try and convince some more of my friends to play, but if not I probably will stick without playing the raids.
---
Good luck though dude, hopefully you can find a group soon.
---
Oh yeah i have those. Thanks
---
Yeah am I wrong, or is there only a look sensitivity? I can't find any other sensitivity settings, and that makes it so fucking difficult to play on Xbox. Why would you make a shooter game with only one sensitivity setting? That's just awful game design.
---
I appreciate the feedback. I don't want to come off as making excuses though. Like I said I have yet to do a raid so your right in that I don't have the experience to say how everyone acts. I guess I have just been scared from other games. That is why I joined a clan to try and get into raids with people that I at least somewhat know. If you don't mind me asking though what exactly is a "LFG Group"? I would be down for joining one if the experiences are good like you say.
---
Or even better "LF5M beginner run". People flock to those after few minutes. And if you already have 4/5 people Sherpas are way more likely to help you.
---
Gimme

Your friend sounds like a normal person...leave them alone.

Do you have children?

At this point in image quality, you either go grab the source image and re-do it or deep fry it to smithereens.
---
But you can't walk from South America to Germany very easy
---
Is it confirmed to be in Europe? I'm sure I've heard some of the NPCs say something like "so you've been to Europe? How is it?"
---
Lazer Lemon or gtfo.
---
I would pay for that g tag for sure.
---
Yeah. this is dumb. I decided to jump back in, and was creating a new character to play with a  buddy. Automatically puts me at the tower after a lame intro runthrough, and I'm like... wait. why am I here? what happened to the little earth town and meeting people along the way? And the excitement of unlocking each planet through progression. Now it's just overwhelming instant access to everything and shot to lvl 20. This is dumb, and a huge disappointment to newcomers who are forced to skip the first part of the game entirely.

There is a guide queue. It's the same thing

Fr, could never get any good shit in D1 and now D2 only done Levi and SoTP once through LFG and I have no friends to play with so I‚Äôm never gonna be able to get all the cool Raid stuff 
---

---
I haven‚Äôt played in about 7 or 8 months but before you could download the destiny 2 app on your phone and they have forums on the app where you can ask for help from other players with raids, quests, etc. 
---
Maybe see if that‚Äôs still available
---
Same dude
---
Use the destiny lfg discord, I'm sure you'll find people there for whatever you want to do
---
/r/DestinyTheGame is the main one, while /r/destiny2 is good for memes and shitposting.
---
I understand that much. But what I'm curious to know is, just like you stated, the total points aspect of it.
---
It was limited to faction rally event if im not mistaken, meaning currently unobtainable
---
Lol. Mountain top is in shaxx's inventory. It's the quest with the black armoury icon. It's got multiple steps, so you won't see the reward, but it's there. The most annoying step is "the third wave", which is the nade launcher kills and medals.
---
Even some higher tear enemies can delt with quickly
---
where are you able to buy silver at? i still get errors when i try to do it in game and i dont see it on the library page
---
Super relatable because I suffer from this exact same problem ;-;
---
That's how I've been with every raid besides leviathan. With the light level raises and my inability to grind light levels (laziness on my part) I've been slow to get into raids. I always just do lfg to find people but they end up being toxic and rude
---
Oh yeah. Erentil can do some work. I've got one with tap the trigger. It's nasty.
---
I honestly wouldn‚Äôt doubt it if it were impossible to do it in a 920.
---
From looking on Google, seems it is bugged. Currently it is able to be done by already having it in your inventory. Hopefully they will fix it for you.
---
I know what it does
---
Hmm...always wondered how the vex do it.
---
Tongs and a big pot...who'da'thunk it.

I saw that guy yesterday.

PC? Xbox? PS4? I assume it is the console users who took this hit. PC didn't have mass exodus until the first DLC. Which was honestly shit..
---
Blizzard censoring pro Hong Kong comments. You can look for the news where they banned the winner of a hearthstone tournament AND they fired the interviewers. The easy answer is to just stop playing blizzard-activisions games and luckily destiny 2 jumped from that boat. Even the blizzard subreddit went private
---
What platform are you on
---
Imo this raid takes more coordination then the past 3 raids released. Maybe once more people are the appropriate light level or a cheese is found it could take two hours with new people but certainly not yet.
---
Nightfall has matchmaking now!
---
Yeah, that ain‚Äôt happening chief
---
I bought something in-game and it directed me to the steam store to get the silver.
---
I dont know if you know this,  but you can speak to Amanda holiday in the tower and that gives you the 3 main storyline quests.
---
Duuuude, that was sick! üëèüëè
---
I should have said PC launch on steam haha not sure if 500 hours have even passed yet - I'm sure I'll get there.
---
2x8 Gskill sticks that are on my qualified vendors list and approved for my CPU and MOBO.
---
Yeah i did one of them, what do you recommend doing after that?
---
You can get it to drop from crucible matches
---
What if it projected both of the kills like the kill tracker ghost?
---
Submit that for Bungie Movie of the Week
---
Be on the lookout for those fragments especially! You get an exotic sword and sparrow from it
---
#YES, HUNTER IS THE BEST AND TITANS GAY#

That could be good, but for boss dps lumina isnt that great, meaning your exotic and kinetic slots are taken up

Where's that guy who drove 69,420 miles on the N√ºrburgring in Gran Turismo?

No, i logged on when i lost it it was a few days after Forsaken launched.

---
I'm praying to the RNG gods that either Xur sells it or I get it from the engram he sells at some point.
---
Not gonna lie when I returned to the Cosmodrome with my friends who just now are playing destiny I lost it. Mostly because I had no idea we were going there in the quest we were doing. But still the joy I felt in that one moment to be back where it all started is not something I'll forget.
---
Diversity in a game is always good :)
---
I like watching sunshots mag hear up.
---
Exotics are random drops, but ofc they're much rarer...
---
There's also some quests (non DLC ones) that give you exotics, but they're usually very tough and lengthy.
---
drops, engrams, quests, the usual
---
LFG groups exist, the raid &amp; puzzle isn't that hard to do. Everyone asked for quests for raid weapons before, you get one, then complain about it.
---
Gladd already did it 3 man, but he obviously knows the mechanics and is a very experienced player, it would be very hard for inexperienced raiders
---
This is the correct answer and get the other guy got upvoted more
---
xur too
---
I‚Äôm hearing quests for the free version of the game don‚Äôt give out exotics but I don‚Äôt know whether it‚Äôs true or not
---
I don‚Äôt know if I should view it as a compliment or and insult
---
Ohhhh cool! That's the one time a selfie actually seems cool XD

Comment
---
I like that the hammer on handcannons goes back if you lightly hold the trigger.
---
Do you have catalysts unlocked that you haven't completed yet? If so try finishing those. Usually when I do this a new catalyst will drop soon after.
---
yeah my 35$ game was 38$ &gt;:(
---
I am probably as new as you are.  I just mentioned that because I thought "main quest" was the story line and was really disapointed it being "reach 760 power level".  I find he game really doesn't explain itself well.  I have a friend who played the game for a week now and still hasn't done the story line because AFIK he doesn't know how to get it.
---
Any void kill, be it weapon or ability.
---
Your Titan will start at 750
---
Think about it, isn‚Äôt server overflow the best possible problem to have? Even then it‚Äôs best to give constructive criticism so Bungo knows what you all think rather than a grand majority of you just saying ‚Äúthis sucks‚Äù or ‚Äúget good Bungie!‚Äù
---
Thank you for coming to my TED talk.

You don't kill the sabotuer, shoot the shield drones near him and open the box they protect.

Buy both DLC. 60dollars/euros
---
I got to Fabled in 2 hours comp is so easy now It took me almost all of last season to get to fabled rank.
---
Yeah I ended up getting in as I was posting that comment.
---
Stop it
---
I‚Äôm aware of that much. I mean will I have all the new light quests or will it just dump me into the game without any quests to do?
---
This guy gets it.  Code of the Missile is my guiltiest pleasure.  I scream *YEEEEAAAAAAAAH* as I soar through the air at (for example) Xol, dying instantly.
---
Why do people act like LFG doesn't exist? That's literally how I have done like 95% of my raids.
---
Np :)
---
People like you amaze me. Just casually racist like it‚Äôs no big deal lol, you sound awful to be around. Would it be fine if I said the same thing about black people?
---
suck a fat one dood
---
Come on don't forget r/transmatfiring

Some other lore implies that it is in South America. Hence why Amanda Holliday's family went south from Texas and why when escaping the city to the EDZ you had to fly "across the pond"
---
‚ÄúThe traveler will choose me because my cheeks clap harder.‚Äù
---
I've been the victim of this more times than I'd like to admit... Its like a frame perfect thing where if the enemy dies during the right step of the finisher, you 999,999 yourself lol
---
d2 isn't a f2p game. that's why you only get y1 content and social activities. just be happy they allow you to even reach 900+
---
The Arc energy was too much for your poor hunter to handle.
---
Yeah but he seems to get around  without much trouble
---
We love you dude, hope you will get the raid exotic &lt;3
---
Haha. You‚Äôre starting to sound like Shaxx.
---
The hero we needed.
---
Ah, you meant you hadn‚Äôt gotten any of the new Shadowkeep exotics, gotcha.
---
THIS IS FAKE HE USED A DIFFERENT GUN THAT LOOKS LIKE MONTE CARLO. THE GUN HE IS SHOWING IN THE PICTURE IS CALLED DUTY BOUND NOT "MONEY CROLO"
---
lmao
---
There's nothing in the bottom left...
---
Currently 950 and every encounter is easy af.
---
Are you role playing as your Titan?
---
Didn‚Äôt blizzard just send them to a folder in your files?  They have a key binding for it in game

This is like the ultimate "Push Atheon off a cliff."
---
Now to figure out what happened to replicate it... üòà
---
Oh ok
---
I am pretty sure you will get the new light quests too
---
Probably if needed it takes only a few minutes to cross the planet. But under most circumstances if you're just gonna go out on a patrol why not, y'know. Enjoy the ride a little
---
u/endertwelve was onto something, Bungie.
---
Ps4
---
POG!
---
That....that works?!
---
Lol he was joking dawg
---
YES
---
How is that racist? I sware you guys are pussys. Saying what race you are or whatever is not racist. Calling white people crackers who shoot up schools cause they get bullied or calling Mexicans border jumping aliens is racist.
---
Never done the full raid because of this but I dont need to because I already have 1k voices
---
It's crazy how easy it is now. I just wanted to give the new Freelancer mode a try and ended up getting it a hour or 2 later.
---
That‚Äôs because it‚Äôs not a solo game, it‚Äôs online. Go play super Mario if you wanna solo.
---
Depends on your play style. Personally I run AoS..  but if you are using that you want to be sure you can hit most of your shots to get the most out of that gun.
---
Aight, imma head out
---
Hmm not sure then. I know she gave me a quest to get like a forge stone in the EDZ or some nonsense.
---
And yeah you do get the keys that way more or less.
---
What are the exotic quests? Sorry for all the questions but im trying to figure out
---
Not sure. Something I've been wondering too. Been trying to find a trend but haven't been overly successful yet, though haven't really been looking that intently
---
For those interested, it‚Äôs a Chiappa Rhino chambered in .357 mag. Notable for firing from the bottom chamber of the cylinder rather than the top (like nearly every other revolver) and being designed by Emilio Ghisoni ‚Äî the dude who designed the Mateba Model 6 Unica which was the basis for the Last Word/Golden Gun model.
---
Now I have to grind for not forgotten so I still have a hard to get weapon
---
I agree with you, it is called joke :)
---
WOOOOW 1 sec in the match and this man already has a super just wooow like stop hacking plz
---
You seem to not be able to comprehend the situation. If a person makes a post KWTD they are not looking to teach people period.  Its the ENTIRE point of KWTD.  There are plenty of groups/discord that offer Shepard services and help out the fellow blueberries. All you have to do is look or post looking for Shepard. I for one have been help and have helped back. After day one raiding GoS I have gone back and helped everyone that has ask me. Even as far as spending 1 hour on a phase cause the blueberries didn‚Äôt understand the mechanics for preventing the whole. So your ignorance and assumptions are misplaced. 
---
With how quick you are to judge, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprise if you‚Äôre the type to ‚Äúmysteriously have to go‚Äù when your lfg group wipes more than 1 time.
---
I‚Äôm trying to figure it out for my friend, he completed his raid yesterday, and he can‚Äôt get his code, 
---
for the people who have gotten the code/are wanting their code, can you get yours?
---
This is a lame take! There's no reason why all of the game's content couldn't be available to all players. Why do you want FEWER options?
---
Have you done a public event on any location yet? Or have you stuck to story, PvP? Strikes?
---
It's the vanguard pinnacle grenade launcher. You can pick up the quest for it from zavala - I believe the quest is called "a gift for the worthy"
---
All the quest requires are 3 steps: a bunch of grenade launcher kills in strikes, grenade launcher multi kills in strikes, and "points" gained by getting kills in general and completing strikes. Doing the playlist vanguard strikes grant significantly more progress on the quest steps compared to queuing into specific strikes through a planetary destination
---
Yes.  There is more content in the new light version than was in your original.  The new light contains the Warmind, Red War, and Curse of Osiris expansions.
---
But it does not contain any of the Forsaken or new Shadowkeep content.
---
The landing surface has to be absolutely flat though. I've done this many times.
---
Recluse still reigns over pretty much any other cqc weapon. Honestly cant figure out why it wasnt nerfed. I mean cmon make the dmg buff only work on headshots and change feeding frenzy for outlaw so precision hits actually matter. Or make it so the perk doesnt reproc from recluse kills. Atm its just an instant win button.
---
As for longer ranges scouts and autos are fairly viable now, and hand cannons are still good.
---
Wait is this an emote
---
I've done plenty of public events, yes.
---
I still wish there was an easy way to remove my gun from the shot. I want to take wallpaper quality shots but I don't want a stupid gun in the way
---
It's literally in Nepal. But sure. You guys keep being wrong when it was figured out a long ass time ago. As in, at least 2 years ago. Or you could just Google it too. That might help.
---
I did, but the prompt to loot the box never shows
---
Guess I'll do that
---
Yea, sorry for the confusion man
---
But split feed /s
---
I‚Äôm just scared of pissing people off because I‚Äôm not the best person at this game and I literally only have time after work to play. My anxieties tell me no.
---
So it‚Äôs easy to do without communicating as long as you communicate first? You‚Äôve gotta be an internet troll.
---
Or you know just wear your helmet the entire time and not care about what your guys looks like.

Helmets are a lot cooler than looking at your face

Don't forget about that goddamn beloved, and all fusion rifles.
---
They boosted everyone to 750 if I'm not mistaken.
---
Had the same happen to me last season. Log out of the game, then log back in. See if that works. Alternatively, go ahead and match make into another comp match. Usually the triumph pops after one of those.
---
I don't remember but i know they often drop from bosses, sometime yellow health bar enemies or end run rewards.
---
If you're looking for a bad word to call white trash, try "Warlock".  Thats pretty insulting for sure.
---
It truth, its a touchy subject.  I have black friends, they say what they want to say, i dont join in, even if they dont care.
---
I think its an insulting word but again, thats just me.  Younger people say things that shock me every day.  
---
I have two kids in high school.  it drops my jaw when i hear their friends talk sometimes.  
---
i am 50 and raised my kids how i am.  They dont curse in front of adults or family, IF they curse at all.  If i ever hear it, they know i would beat them (not literally).  
---
its just how i want them to be perceived in public and they understand that.
---
when black people call each other that, I feel the same way.  it lowers my perception of who they are in society.  of course, many other people accept them regardless.  
---
maybe im from a different generation.
---
i will say this, if black people really want white people to stop using it, they shouldnt use it themselves.  but again, nothing i say or do will change how society is.
---
Lol, was a massive meme for ages. Still, plenty of shit to do nowadays.
---
So in a way it's a shame if we just played the same room for 40 hours a week.
---
Any who hope you're enjoying the game. Eyes up guardian.
---
"The Trickster"
---
Haha sherpa channels
---
How do I find and join it?
---
I joined a clan and got a raid team together pretty quickly a while ago. Just find an active one and ask if anyone is willing to let you raid with them.
---
Why do you think it's locked? According to the release calendar, that strike is available to everyone.
---
First tries? Good 4-5 hours. If you know how to do it? Still good 2-3 hours lol, the grind is realüòì

---
Vault of Glass is only rated so highly because of nostalgia. Opening the vault, defending the confluxes, and oracles consist of killing ads, then waiting. The rest of the raid is average imo.
---
A small amount of drive space will be saved but you also run the risk of damaging the disc accidentally and not being able to play the game ever.
---
Probably can drop as floor loot from spider‚Äôs weekly targets.
---
You sound like a blast at parties.

There is a version the main armour for each class plus a different ornament but each is stylized differently. Sorry

If you mean the arc gun that looks like dust rock blues its a world drop so its random, bu dont bother because its a trash energy shotgun

Bet joes the only one with a job lmao

How to get it? Bright dust? Silver?
---
La Mayo
---
And I love you, random citizen!
---
Floor loot? You mean out of engrams that drop from those random HVT's on the tangled shore? If that's the only way, that sucks because Spider's bounties don't give gear anymore.
---
Think, not 100% sure. That there is some Triumphs that require Hero Nightmare runs that go towards this seasons title? I could be wrong though
---
No the actual one....
---
Do people not realize you can just do the raid with five people you don't know? I do several raids a week at least and I know nobody who plays this game. I don't get it - it's not even that hard.
---
I was just going to say, he's one of those play-for-a-living 1%ers who's always a front runner in those meaningless worlds first races.
---
Speaking of which, I need a PS4 clan of sweats. Both PvP and PvE. I'm looking to go crazy with D2 this year.
---
Pretty much. They have a lot of exotic quests, you can do all the adventures on each planet, weekly challenges to level up, raids, pinnacle weapons, all the different activities they have available now (esclation protocol, vex offensive,etc), work on titles, unlock secrets, dungeons, and so much more. 
---
The exotic heroic whisper quest (catylst and ship) takes 3weeks alone to complete. Heroic outbreak for those items takes even longer. That alone give you at least a month of content to grind for. 
---
You'll be grinding for a while if you do everything. They have 3 years of content and more to come.  
---
I would advise finding a clan and doing stuff together. Clans can make a world of difference in game play. You can also use LFG, but you tend to find more toxic people that way. 
---
Anyways, enjoy the grind! And have a great day!
---
Why am I not surprised lol my first meme when I started D2 was going back to D1 watching a video (points if you guess the youtuber lol) with him going "MWY NWAME CWOTA" and so on lol
---
Would be the reason why, Bungie would prefer us to play multiple stuff to grind rather than the same spot
---
Since SK came out? I'm enjoying so much more, I was originally but more so now they've done a great job with the DLC and with the campaign being stretched season long, it feels like an MMO now and that I love
---
Thanks !
---
You can do the raid with randoms you know - it's not bad. I do it all the time.
---
Go to change character screen and back in. Should be there
---
Cheers mate, I might see if I can learn how to edit and speed up the in between stuff and put sum music behind it.
---
Alright. Cool. Thanks! I just was confused as to where it was!
---
I completely agree, and if I had the money I‚Äôd go to pc.
---
You know if you shoot hobgoblins head off they can't shield.
---
It's not working for me. I have the Day Tripped one and I just did a bounty on the moon and still says 0/2?
---
So for me, I just waited a day and it worked. It might have been because the following day the type of forge had changed, so maybe it requires 2 different forges? But doing it once with 0% just doesn't make any sense
---
I did a day 1 with a guy who's first language was French and he was a great teammate. If your accent is particularly thick, try LFGing for people who speak your native language. 
---
If you're first language is French, I've noticed a lot of you Frenchies on the PC LFG so you might have good luck there.
---
Are you serious right now? Be glad you didn't have to grind for this before Shadowkeep.
---
doesn't vanilla skyburner's do this too?
---
I got mine today too at the same light level as yours. So looking forward to running all of this week‚Äôs powerful with this.
---
From the time you got into the portal and out, it actually took 8 seconds instead of 5.

Somebody is steamin!

Achieving fabled was easy with the rank changes, but the wins were grueling

Also, it is the one with selectable mods and energy levels

What they meant was to just leave the mission.

Just consume them

&gt;who the fuck cares? quit the god damn game and move on in silence.

Guess your past explains everything.

I don't get the warlock thing. Im white and a gamer in my late 20s. I think id be excited for someone to call me Warlock lol
---
I picked up new legs and cloak and was able to change appearance, got the full set on now.thanks though
---
POW! Right in the kisser!
---
Actually, it does. If you have one character at 950 and you switch to another character, the new one will power level.
---
so why didn‚Äôt you quit the game if we have went through this before?
---
Bro the cap is 950 how would you get any higher loot. The artifact gives you that +10.
---
It took me a day to get it with the new glory system, I ain't even mad.
---
it‚Äôs gonna be a breeze
---
Segway sparrow when?
---
Oh, I'm probably bad at counting then, lol
---
it be like that sometimes üòéüòéüòéüòé
---
Yep same lol I left around that time, no LW raid no scourge of the past, just did my first forge the other day...lot of stuff to do for sure
---
I must find him
---
I must know him
---
OK. That sucks. I literally pressed "F" and abandoned it. How can I get it back?
---
Yes! Giving in gunsmith telemetries gives mods I remember bc I received a fusion rifle mod yesterday
---
Too bad your teammate couldn't channel the recovery god as well
---
It happens sometimes, don‚Äôt worry about it.
---
I mean...it is a heavy... makes sense
---
What did you do to get this choice??
---
Top tree Arc Strider, Liars Handshake and all arc abilities on Artifact make this pretty easy. Add in Tractor Cannon and One Two Punch for total domination haha
---
 W  H  A  T
---
Ok thanks for the help, I got a few exotics in the start so I'm not too worried about it.
---
Itd be nice to have the character customization expand too. More hairstyles, markings, scars, etc...
---
Maybe even have some tied to activity challenges or something? 
---
If they kept it out of EV itd be awesome, imo.
---
What‚Äôs the weapon?
---
Life is no fun if you don't act immature sometimes.

You can host the event yourself.
---
It‚Äôs requires 3 lost sectors on Nessus. There are 3-4 good YouTube guides on it
---
They kinda hint that it does but I guess not
---
Still very much one of the best weapons in game even with the nerf!
---
Vault of Grass is the name of the cabinet where I store my weed.
---
A thousand times yes
---
I've played a bit of borderlands 3 on it, and dauntless on it. Both games are pretty good, would recommend if they weren't on epic games.
---
The launcher was impossible to navigate half the time, and setting launch properties for the games wasn't really possible to find how to do without googling it. My friends list is glitchy, often leading to me unable to join my friends games or invite them. Often times I wouldn't be able to see them even online. Achievements aren't a thing, so everyone trying to go get those top level borderlands achievements on console are having a blast, meanwhile I can't get any of them because epic doesn't support achievements.
---
I'm kinda sad that I had to get borderlands on epic. My friends all basically forced me to buy it with my own money or they would buy it for me. It's a great game minus supporting 2k and their BS, and supporting epic.
---
Try checking with Amanda Holliday to see if she has the quest available again.
---
Noob question... I hate pvp, but Recluse looks so awesome. How much better is Recluse vs. Riskrunner with Catalyst?
---
It's probably the game, happens on console as well but probably even worse.
---
I‚Äôm so surprised people still don‚Äôt know this! It‚Äôs literally been blasted on everything Destiny for the last few weeks.
---
Yeah, I agree, although it is reused in the developer sense but it works idc if its reused, if anything with the split I'm more sympathetic and the fact they did this without a big studio is impressive in it's own way I see it? It's a damn good job
---
Yeah D1 Vets will get nostalgia but at the same time, Kinderguardians will go through this and get lore on D1 this adding to the story or bringing back memories
---
But does it work on Trevor
---
Only for phalanx shields. Plus the gun is ass
---
Yup did that with Venezuela
---
Thank you so much! I will try.
---
Y'all ever heard of Destiny LFG? üòÖ not doing the raid because you dont have 5 friends is a bad excuse...
---
Dude looks like a blue Conan O‚ÄôBrien
---
Go figure
---
Nope Trevor will still insta gib you quicker than Hal-9000 can say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù
---
Destiny cops! Tragus and Winters, they are the good guys! Best dang cops in the Galaxy!
---
Thanks!
---
Bro
---
No heroic taken blights are random when there is enough guardians around
---
Former Sherpa here.  I‚Äôve run raids with people who don‚Äôt shut up, and others who don‚Äôt say a word.  You don‚Äôt need to talk if you don‚Äôt want to.  Just go in with a positive attitude, a willingness to learn, and the rest will fall into place.
---
Nah I ain‚Äôt no bitch 6,2 250? Must be a little obese
---
Huckleberry is better
---
Kamehameha gang
---
It took me a bit to figure it out too. I wish they would have made that a little more obvious with the changes. Oh well.
---
Wobbuffet uses 'counter'
---
Lord Beerus chubby?
---
Little fuckers deserved it...
---
Hmmm not sure then
---
Task failed successfully.
---
You can change your name for free, so you see some creative things
---
tried that. even reset my game and it still wont show
---
They freak me out so they deserved to die.... change my mind.
---
I'm currently running riskrunner and can confirm the accuracy of this post.
---
They're fucking gross as shit apparently splash damage doesn't do anything to em so I basically wasted an entire mag on em
---
1 no 2 only in new ones 3 yes
---
Can tell lol
---
I've played 45 hours and have gotten 7 exotic drops including a fated and the one from level 25 or whatever, my friend has played 20 hours and got it as like his second drop
---
Once it‚Äôs full( you have to fill the last rank) when you haves over an activity like crucible if you maxed valor it will say ‚Äúx‚Äù to reset valor
---
Isn't he trapped in the infinite forest? I thought that if he leaves it, one of the minds he killed will reform and then we all die
---
At least you have terrible aim, so some of them might have managed to get away and hide in time #WormsArePeopleToo
---
How did you get it so smooth?
---
It actually amazes that people think he's dead serious about everything
---
You have to get a triumph seal
---
Not showing up for my hunter either.  Been driving me crazy for days!  I hope it gets fixed, and soon!   :|
---
There is a story......
---
Submit this to @destinynames
---
Imagine going to a Destiny 2 fan area and telling everyone that in your opinion you don't like the thing they like. This is going to go well.
---
True.
---
Yes yes, my Dreadnought is here,  but where is the Leviathan? And what about me son Crota? Still on Earth's Moon or has he Ascended to the afterlife?
---
If someone buys me shadowkeep mi carrying u all with some ppl ;v
---
How do you unlock the "monte carlo" quest or is it a random drop?
---
I just played this guy in pvp and got my ass handed to me
---
This is brilliant...

changes daily.
---
Bungie changed it so you can only do one forge at a time, it switches every day. Not sure why seems dumb to me.

Funny. I posted something about wanting to turn nightfall bosses in to vanity pets that award the aura instead of banners. The top comment was ‚Äòno, this isn‚Äôt wow.‚Äô Barber NPC is literally from WoW. Next you‚Äôll be wanting a Transmutation NPC as well to change the appearance of any armour piece into any other armour piece (I know this sounds like sarcasm but I‚Äôve seen a lot of posts recently wanting this function but not the NPC). 
---
Be careful what you wish for.
---
Oh dang idk then. I‚Äôll check in a bit I might be in the same boat
---
Did you bother going through the campaigns or did you simply jump into the middle of the game expecting the same experience as the people who have actually played through the story content?
---
Yeah, the RNG is questionable a lot of the time. 
---
Heres an F for your troubles.
---
Eververse gear, dupe ships and sparrows, eververse bounties
---
The surface? In all honesty it isn‚Äôt all that smooth. Maybe the picture quality makes it look that way. It‚Äôs rather rough right now, due to the fact that the layers form a sort of grain. I used a disc sander to remove the remains of the support, but I haven‚Äôt done anything else yet.
---
You have quests to unlock each one in series. I think you can only fast travel to volunder but you can manually travel to whichever, granted you‚Äôve done the quests that is
---
Venezuela?
---
Shite.
---
I did that but I didnt get it
---
Vuvuzuela sorry
---
Necrochasm
---
Oh whoops should have clarified that I meant on the reddit not in the game
---
Thats weird... i just completed a nightfall but that was last season. Did you do it with a friend?
---
Get to legendary, and then complete that level. Its not for the faint of heart.
---
Hahahaha
---
The easiest of them all is Dredgen the gambit one
---
Ah, I see. I was afraid I‚Äôd have to stoop to socialism to grind xp, thank god for typos
---
These things will literally burrow into a Hive and slowly kill them if they don‚Äôt kill others. I am liberating a future Hive of this bloodlust.
---
I love this old school reference! Now I have Jungle Book songs stuck in my head
