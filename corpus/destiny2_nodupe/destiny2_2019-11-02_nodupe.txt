---
I kind of enjoy my gliding, and I haven't really had much success with blink, though I've been trying to see if works. 
---

---
I just don't get much distance, less so than a normal jump.
---
If you got to pay someone to get things for you in the game...why are you even playing?  Nothing in the game is hard to get.
---
Each one gets longer than the last.
---
I believe they start at 30 minutes.
---
Almost felt like when the Elite first dropped in to help Master Chief
---
Throw more grenades
---
I need a gamemode that let's me use as many exotics as i want
---
This sort of shit occurred a lot for me about 4 months ago. I think that it‚Äôs because my internet connection wasn‚Äôt optimal, so opponents thought that I had invincibility hacks or the likes. I‚Äôm glad that it no longer happens.
---
Shit back in my day xur was at the tower
---
Hey I remember this meme from last nnn
---
Witch-hunting is severely against the rules.
---
You heretic! You‚Äôre a Hunter!
---
Same, I loved to blink into a room full of people and pop my bladedancer midair and just go all out
---
I like shaxx
---
Can someone help xur go to Mars, mercury, dreaming city, or the moon. go explore Xur!
---
Any story with Shaxx is a good Shaxx story. [Here‚Äôs him having sex with Mara Sov](https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/mark-of-the-great-hunt)
---
Completely forgot I was on a destiny sub when I read this
---
Nah Arcite 99-40
---
Actually they can most certainly kill you if they are dead
---
Wait it out until Tuesday when iron banner comes ez 100% win
---
Zoinks.
---
open the chests on the barge too
---
Oh, well they didn't get sweet loot, fuck em.
---
Light.gg
---
Wow, that looks absolutely gorgeous! I really love how you captured the expression, he looks so sad :(
---
Ah momentum. So fun. So stupid. But so even.
---
Bruh, that's me in crucible üòÇ
---
I get what you were trying to say, maybe the format just didn't make sense to me lol.
---
 I could see how you would think it is toxic, but alot of people are doing it just to get randy/ catalysts. I know otherwise, I'd never touch a scout rifle in my life lol.
---
Yeah, Dodge and Blink wouldn't be infuriating at all.
---
I really hope we investigate deepstone crypt at some point. Caydes stash definitely made them sound sinister.
---
Spoopy
---
Of course it‚Äôs going to get more cheaters but i guess i live in an area where there aren‚Äôt many cheaters, mostly Internet Time-Lords
---
I don‚Äôt think so! When you edit your subclass, near the bottom, there should be an option to change your ‚Äòglide type.‚Äô 
---
For the void warlock there should be a ‚Äòblink‚Äô option.
---
shut mouth
---
No
---
Time to get off the internet. Your parents are going to be home soon.
---
I just started playing, I figured the captains WERE the large blockers. Good to know!
---
Remember when hunters had blink?
---
Good times.
---
that's a traffic judge in Rhode island lmfao
---
Thanks so much!
---
I dunno, not very. It wouldn‚Äôt change much.
---
No, it‚Äôs just that the Leviathan door miraculously appeared behind them. Strange.
---
Is that the gambit snipe? Also lmk if you want a few tips on sniping
---
As a blink main, this hurts...
---
Yet it is so true..
---
Excuse me????? Hunter blink thank you very much
---
Thats me... I like blink but i have trouble doing parkoure because it dosnt go as far as the glide thing
---
No, it was just in the crucible, I just hopped in and played a match real quick for some chocolate strange coins, and will do!
---
Lol I'm not defending anyone, I'm just explaining it. Secondly, calm the fuck down and take a chill pill. I don't care what you think of people that like dark humor but for shite sakes quit taking out your aggression on me.
---
Only worked on Nightstalker though, so you're still not totally right. Hunters couldn't dodge and Blink at the same time in D1.
---
My first run I was like nova bomb bitch, he laughed, I laughed, he swung his axe, I cried.
---
There's an app, dude
---
Probably not but I might as well use it to get that non-existent loot drop boost
---
Thanks for the weapon choices but the group thing see im xbox so finding a group who aren't strict or complete rage quitting dicks who quits after a couple of rounds is sometimes hard to find and thats usually my plan B
---
Play that new mode where it one shots with headshot. Very nice
---
I rememver posting a Hunter Carolina WAAY back but the hood kinda ruined it
---
Hey guys I started playing this week and I'm grinding crucible for last word and the recluse.
---
Are there any other quests I should pick up to grind at the same time so I never have to step on this god forsaken fucking thing again?
---
there's nothing that needs explaining though, you act like I have no concept of why people would laugh at something like this. I'm very plainly aware of how shitty people are. choke on your condescension.
---
First slide still applies to me, a D1 vet. at least I‚Äôm not a warlock main
---
Weird that you can pick it up without being able to complete it.
---
Homie you‚Äôre a sad human being if you‚Äôre this angry
---
Haven‚Äôt run CoS and I know that‚Äôs on leviathan too sooo yea. Was just asking a question
---
#I COULD FEEL THAT IN MY BONES!
---
Fair enough I'm the same way, I remember I loved when crota's end come out as I could finally solo a raid. So much less stressful. Good luck with the dungeon
---
i tried finding a "fiery" looking ghost shell, that was the best i could get
---
I have literally been thinking about that for the past 4 years. Like imagine the chaos there would be.
---
i want that helmet so bad, havnt got it tho :(
---
Play the game.
---
Go to the planet you want and do patrols and bounties and get chests.  Then hit the public events. Legendary shards come easy enough from dismantling the many weapons you find everywhere.
---
Titan: is punching an instrument?
---
You had me in the first 5/6ths, not gonna lie.
---
i was a hunter main in d1, blink was only jump i used, d2 i started out as a hunter and realised no blink yo switched to warlock lol
---
first thing I saw was the crown of tempests? now that is epic
---
THANK YOU!!! 
---
SO MUCH SHIT I ALWAYS WANNA GET BUT AFTER GETTING WEEKLY 3,600 BRIGHT DUST ONLY WAY IS 10 DUST BOUNTIES R U KIDDING ME
---
.... and then you look at her and say ‚Äú How‚Äôs your sister‚Äù and then blows your fucking head off with OEM bottom tree striker
---
Survival freelance is my bane. The enemy team is always 1 or 2 people who are headshot master.  Grinding for weapon quest is absolute nightmare
---
Not since the beginning obviously whiney bitch
---
Its literally not salt, its actual fact that those are the only good exotics in the game. The rest are unuseable trash. Anyone with an ounce of game knowledge knows this. The only people that use that bottom tier trash exotics are the same people who run double auto rifles in pve activities and cant make taken blight heroic ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Clean.. just like your feet...
---
Totally fair, absolutely fair.
---
To be honest, I would prefer just getting bright dust compared to anything the engram has to offer or give us the option to choose either or.
---
Does it move like it‚Äôs Neo? Or John Wick?
---
Underrated comment
---
I know all the steps. It's just when I get to the camp to get the first step I can't interact with it
---
An ancient, powerful hive god vs any damage whatsoever
---
Looks AMAZING!!!
---
 Shaxx is way buffer IMO. üòÅ
---
Just got it today as a random drop on Mars. Only my second exotic but I'm impressed none the less. Great for the fodder but kinda garbage against bosses
---
Sadly none of them are worth it.
---
A certain mod on the seasonal artifact gives ‚Äúfrom the abyss‚Äù which makes your void super do more damage when you‚Äôre critically wounded. He shot himself low in order to proc the damage buff
---
There's an item (can't remember what it is) but makes it to where when you're in critical health void supers do more damage or something along those lines
---
No.
---
What mod do you have on Luna's? I was absolutely garbage with it before I put the target acquisition mod on mine. Now I can clap people pretty consistently with it.
---
Does that really make up for all the 3v1 T-bagging I see in comp?
---
I dont know where it is cause he read it, but whoever said "It's possible that he could know fortnite dances", thank you, this is my first post here.
---
As cool as it would be I dont think they would. Itd create to big of a skill gap between new players and veterans.
---
Then Queensbreaker flashbacks
---
I didnt get the truth when it launched cuz i saw it as a trash exotic with no real use, mainly because we have tracking rockets already. As an invader in gambit, i was sorely mistaken.
---
Malfeasance for PvE. 
---
Last Word is better for PvP if you're good with it but Malfeasance has the benefit of basically negating the hand cannon range nerf. If you hit a guardian 5 times they will die no matter what range you're at. So it's definitely easier to use in PvP than Last Word, but Last Word has a higher ceiling of effectiveness in my opinion.
---
I think it's on the first vanguard node, unless it has changed.
---
Same place as strike and nightfall playlist, to the far left
---
Both.
---
Also GoS raid and 980 nightfall can grant gear up to 960.
---
The quest for Redrix's Broadsword asks you to reset your valor 5 times within one season (it will count if you get 5 resets in one season but don't actually reach that step until a future season).
---
Oops ty :D
---
Red war is "the main quest." It was the game upon release. I think it is important to do because even though you don't get item rewards any more, it functions as a tour of most of the planets, and teaches you things about the game that later parts expect you to know.
---
I feel like red war is better for combat basics
---
Jfc kid calm down currently solo flawlessing heresy b2b2b, something far more important than your reddit replies being wrong. Xur has never been here on a tuesday.
---
Idiot.
---
You should see a variety of weekly challenges in the Tower and on a couple of planets that show "Powerful Gear" as the reward. 
---
Anything that says powerful gear will give you an item at a higher power level.
---
Are you on the same character that you previously did the Menagerie on?
---
Xur is available every Tuesday from 12:01am til 12:59pm. God you‚Äôre dense.
---
Amen to that
---
This is a past Eververse set? If so, the only way to get it is if it randomly shows up in the bright dust rotation, which rotates every week. The odds are not good.
---
Once you hit 900 you work towards ‚Äúpowerful‚Äù rewards for things like Crucible and Vanguard playlists, Nightfall strikes, and Gambit. Most of them will be highlighted in yellow in your directory. Don‚Äôt forget to pick up bounties because Zavala and Banshee will give you a powerful reward after doing so many each week.
---
You mean higher light level?
---
lucky ;\ and here i am with people just shooting shit while the wizards are up not trying to do mechanics... then when you get to the last boss they let the nightmares run into the portals ;_;
---
Ornaments aren't consumables, there's not supposed to be any way to delete them. 
---
Not all items can be ornamented, though. This ornament set can only be applied to legendary rarity armor dropped sometime after the New Light update (Oct 1, 2019). Older armor and non-legendary armor cannot have the eververse universal ornament sets applied.
---
REALLY want this shader, was wondering the same. Looks perfect for my ideal color scheme, love it.
---
For me, getting thr BrayTech Werewolf did the job. Its whopping 950 power level will give you a boost for your total power and you'll get higher level world drops. Now this could be all wrong but that's how I interpret it
---
My wife got Izanagi about a month before the new season just in case something like this happened. I got spooked because I heard that Ada-1 was going away in the vidoc so we scrambled to get it.
---
I'm gonna call BS rn, but how do you access that file?
---
Console connection be like
---
Yes he would, but seriously if this pic's real i'm gonna cry. That pic is from the one court when he let the kid decide what amount of money will they be charging his dad.
---
would explain the violence tho
---
They either need to give everyone back their keys or just say fuck it and give people the item they unlock.
---
I'd suggest going with Shadowkeep as the current META exotics can be acquired from those raids.
---
Im at 1900 now...I day grinding üòÖ
---
#THIS IS AMAZING
---
How I still feel using risk runner
---
Maybe he was checking his bounties/quest progress.
---
I just got to 950 item power. And I'm wondering, whats the easiest pinnacle activity I should attempt first. Does anyone know?
---
Had the same question a couple of days ago.
---
You should be good to go, just bear in mind the Drifter moved to the Annex.
---
Lol it's not that bad to be a hunter. Simplest way to dumb it down is that most of warlocks and Titans kits are fairly easy to do, because it results are immediate and obvious.  
---
For the most part as a titan you're either killing something with a punch (which the ability makes it easier to or rewards you with a buff), or using fairly good grenades. Plus you can throw up a wall.
---
Warlocks are all about ways to give themselves buffs. Many of the skill trees do so by "charging/eating" their grenade to unleash other abilities, with their melees providing minor bonuses. Plus their AoE ability can heal or buff dmg, as well as other effects depending on skill tree like a little orb that shoots.
---
Hunters... well.... we have stuff, but they either take prep work to fully utilize, or the effects are there, just not as obvious/provide non-damage utility.
---
And this is not even touching face with how Exotics change/boost some of these aspects.
---
Oh cool I'll try that! What does a triumph do though? I often notice I've unlocked some but never really explored to see what's up with them!
---
Awesome
---
Actually you get them just as fast as Pre-Shadowkeep once you hit lvl. 100 in the Season Pass. You get one every 5 lvls or 500,000 XP. The problem is not how fast and how many you earn. The problem is the loot. It's not fun getting old Eververse stuff I got several seasons before.
---
At least a 'lock doesn't have the pressure of worrying about missing that one shot they have
---
This one's for the undying title: kill am overlord in the 3 moon locations other than Sorrow's Harbour
---
Absolutely not. I hope they get some fixes in for stiff like that.
---
yup
---
Have Scorn been shown in d1? I don't have a console to check. If they were introduced, then Cayde possibly knew about their weaponry, but he spent most of his time in Tower
---
OEM is powered by salt water taffy.
---
You need plus to play it at all lol
---
" bruh "
---
Ok cool! So basically completing a triumph is just for completion and aesthetics?
---
Afaik the hammer throwing super is bugged in that mode
---
Got the same issue
---
34 kill streak? Dammn..
---
That's funny, because I've gotten one-hit by every warlock that's ever melee'd me in crucible. I've also watched them one-hit other hunters and two-hit other warlocks. I've watched their grenades wipe out entire teams that were dumb enough to run right into them, and watched them pop a titan when it landed right on top of him. You don't one-hit Titans, sure, but it only takes 2 - 3 for you to drop them.. it takes us 3 - 4 to drop them.
---
Wormhusk is nice and all.. but Arc Battery is a seasonal artifact mod. What do you think is gonna happen in 40ish days? Not to mention it mostly makes it so we don't get one-hit by Warlock and Titan punches/shotgun blasts/supers.. and that STILL Requires you to time it properly. It's not nearly as OP as you make it out to be.. especially not compared to something like OEM.
---
You forget Obi Wan, you have the high ground. You guys can basically fly through the air and fire target-tracking flame swords at people.. basically hunter Blade Barrage, but better, and lasts considerably longer. You don't even need to wait for it to end to get your super power back for it.. meanwhile, blade barrage needs to end AND you need to wear an exotic to get even SOME of the super power back for it.  Plus almost all of our supers don't give us ANY extra durability. Even OEM Titans duck for cover when you guys launch a super.
---
I'm going to love seeing the baddies with a gold medal flaunting the emblem once this cancerous mode is done with üòÇüòÇ
---
Same here. Warlock main, but switched to hunter just to play PvP.
---
Getting good at gunplay with warlock made playing the hunter class super easy in PvP.
---
You can blink that often? I tried it when I got it, but haven't put much use in it. That sounds so good
---
You shot his head off before killing him. Happens every time.
---
I have been playing for one day without ps plus
---
Well yeah but if you complete a title then you can equip it on a character which everyone can see.
---
Oh i was under the assumption you needed plus to play it, you will 100% need it to play with ppl
---
Pull blue/green items from collection book before claiming the season pass items (as others mentioned), to make the purple items even higher.
---
If you pull an item from collection book, you will see that this item's level immidiatelly increased, so keep repeating this:
---
Head, shoulder, chest, boots, bond. Head, shoulder, chest, boots, bond... Do it until your blues wont give increased level. Its around 910.
---
If you have vanguard/crucible tokens on your main, you can also use it after the seasonal items. 
---
Took me like 10 minutes to reach 945 on a brand new hunter.
---
You have clearly never used recluse.... that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm gonna say
---
Run
---
Loaded question is better for add clear than recluse.
---
Reckoning is free to everyone along with gambit prime.
---
Vanguard strikes are good for candy grinding
---
Not really but ok. It takes special ammo, takes time to charge, and only has ‚Äúdragonfly‚Äù when the mag is full. And with recluse you can run mountaintop and just melt all majors and recluse MELTS ads and you can use wendigo for boss damage.
---
Is bonus Glory points on reset thingy still around?
---
I'm at 2030 at the moment and I don't think my heart could take another competitive lol
---
I wish I was that good
---
He lost his ghost and his light so hes dead just like other gaurdains who lost their light there not coming back just like him
---
Thats why those people mostly pay for carries rather than recoveries.
---
Can you get that one this year?
---
It's not the fact its F2P it's the fact that it moved to Steam
---
Wait but then I never got my weak synthesizer to start Reckoning Nani the heck
---
Bruh you acting smart and now dont even reply?
---
Based on where you were looking.
---
Then when I teleported underneath a platform I was trying to jump to, I figured out that it's obviously not that, then gave up on trying to use it altogether because the other jumps also just felt better to me since they didn't have cooldowns.
---
He's probably just started using the hack and is getting to grips with it/testing it out etc.
---
*dies because this looks so good*
---
Well, yeah. But can you think of any other reason to specify that the helmet stayed on? You think they went to a sauna for Mara's last night before heading off to face Oryx?
---
Oh, i guess we gotta be careful playing warlock
---
That's fucking weird, but awesome tech. I'll keep that in mind; thanks.
---
Aren‚Äôt rice cakes once per week?
---
I have a ton of ghost traces, apparently they‚Äôll keep dropping till you collect all the ghosts.
---
But only 3 cakes as of now and one already eaten by a rabbit.
---
To make sure it's clear: You only **need to equip it**, you **do not** need to use it.
---
If your on PS4 you can set the date and time stamp back 5 months and 95% of the time you can go solo on any matchmaking and even escalation protocols. When u run out of ammo fast travel to the most convenient flag to rally to on any planet go back and start it again. Ep‚Äôs reset because there aren‚Äôt any real players keeping it going. Great for multi kills
---
That's my biggest thing when playing- Destiny has some of the best wallpaper/screen saver (remember those?) material I've ever seen. The "loading screen" with your ship flying in between the planets is something I really want to screencapture and turn into an endless GIF to use as a screensaver, just for funzies.
---
First go to shaxx and get  SHOCK AND DENIAL
---
" You need to complete 10 Crucible matches in the Competitive playlist "
---
Then  **Get 150 hand cannon kills in Competitive matches**  
---
then 
---
 **Get 200 solar kills in Competitive matches** 
---
then  Complete 3 Rumble matches.¬† 
---
Then  **Get 100 precision hand cannon kills in Competitive** 
---
Then reach fabled in comp
---
To make sure it's clear, too: **all weapons can be forged at any forge**, now. So you only need to wait for a specific forge if pursuing a certain quest or triumph.
---
be vewy, vewy, quiet, I'm hunting wabbits
---
hit detection achievement?
---
When the Nightfall Strike **the Hollowed Lair** becomes available, **Mindbender's Ambition** is probably the most used PvP shotty. Farming it can be difficult without a group, but is doable. If you're able to get a single very high score in the Nightfall with a group, you can equip the emblem you get from the NF strike (the one that displays the score) and farm the Nightfall focusing on speed over score and the score on the emblem will be the determining one for drop chance.
---
Ok so, the thing is those who know obviously have to learn it some way or another.
---
Either from someone else or by doing the raid. Why not watch some videos or join a sherpa raid instead?
---
It‚Äôs understandable that people sometimes want experienced players in their raid, they don‚Äôt wanna have to repeat encounters for example.
---
I hear Exit strat is a good recluse replacement if want to use something else in your energy slot
---
and randy's is literally the only 260 rpm kinetic scout
---
What's your current power level (gear level, not gear + boost)
---
Forsaken is very worth it if you enjoy the game. A lot of great exotic quests. (Including a less bullshit Thorn!)
---
Honestly, it‚Äôs only good if you‚Äôre running 2 handcannons like primary + erianas vow, it‚Äôs not worth it for one slot of weapon when really you could be using other exotics that can really help like dragons shadow, or subclass specific exotics like raiden flux or gwisin vest. And this only goes for PvP. PvE the pants don‚Äôt really do much, and get further overshadowed by things like golden beak, arrow pants or again, raiden flux
---
yeah, same thing for me last night progress on kills and medals were wonky. don't know shat to do about it
---
I believe they've said Pinnacle Quests are going to be around forever.
---
If it's tied to a raid or a still active exotic quest, then no. Maybe Thunderlord since it's on the random drop table, but can't test it myself since I already have it.
---
Because this game is very super famous super famous super famous
---
You can very much hold more than 1 key.
---
Bungie in a nutshell... making content is hard but they can pump out eververse crap like nothing ü§°
---
Caved in chest &gt;.&lt; dear god
---
The Khovostov can be reacquired from your collections.
---
Saying last word gets the job done doesnt make it good. Dont get me wrong if you like using it the go for it but pretty much any other hand cannon is better that in for pve. Austringer for example. More damage, more range, more stability, more ammo. Its just strait up a better weapon. Last word is fun and all but i dont think your convincing anyone that its better than just using another hand cannon.
---
Wat?
---
Don‚Äôt worry bungie will do it for you
---
It's been a long month
---
[removed]
---
Where is that?
---
First of all chill tf out. Just leave the lost sector and go back in and do it again.
---
The secret boss yo need to kill for xenophage is 980 pwr
---
That's fantastic! I love that you can play, and enjoy, destiny together!
---
Looks like he got all dressed up for Halloween then walked in on his parents having sex...
---
You see a guardian go flying across the screen a few seconds after shax says 1 for remaining
---
I‚Äôm not artistic but these would be fantastic in graphic novel form if someone drew them out!!
---
Wow ok you're an asshole
---
Two Crucible quests require kills with grenade launchers and scout rifles.
---
Those who grind the new Randy's Throwing Knife need scout rifle kills.
---
Those who grind Mountaintop need grenade launcher kills.
---
Jade Rabbit has insane aim assist that just makes it the best weapon for a gamemode that has one hit kill headshot mechanics.
---
Fighting Lion is a grenade launcher that has manual detonation and bouncing. The best bet for farming grenade launcher kills.
---
Pretty sure your mistaken. I got mine from the earlier season pass engrams as well. Fated will not drop it tho.
---
Dude wat? Lol
---
well you need 14,000 enemies defeated and medals earned so maybe the progress is just so slow that you think it‚Äôs froze
---
Xur fated def wont. I know that. But who knows what bungie do with season pass. You prob right. Could of been from exotic prior to fated.
---
it multiplies melee damage by x3 not x5
---
oh yea for sure, and they can be a pain as well
---
but it‚Äôs one of the best grinds for armor upgrade stuff anyways so it feels more useful overall 
---
sry i was just excited to finally get it, you do you
---
It's a bug that happened with the halloween update
---
I saw a post the other day saying that if you leave competitive matches Bungie should ban them for the reminder of the season. Idk what‚Äôs with these people just thinking that banning people from playing the game will solve these issues.
---
Ah. I didn‚Äôt even see those quests. Thanks for the explanation.
---
Those aren't bad.  Definitely prefer those over the image in this post.  No offense to the OP, it's a great image - but I live in MN.  I see that white shit too much of the year, I'm not having it on my monitor background. ;)
---
I played pvp in Destiny 1 and I do okay playing non comp. My team either leaves in comp so I play 2v3 or they just hold sprint and feed kills. I don't have pvp godrolls yet either which makes it super hard to win straight up duels. Are the better pvp guns crucible drops I can get from playing non-comp?
---
It's just annoying that the quest for this gun isn't something I can grind by myself, but I'm reliant on teammates for...
---
Absolutely agree, I‚Äôm stuck at 5100 right now from either bad teammates or god level players in my lobby which I will admit are better than me. I enjoy the fast matchmaking but connection based matchmaking can be annoying sometimes
---
Can I jump in crucible and do well . I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm getting clapped because of skill gap or because of my guns and gear
---
Maybe they are trying to enjoy the game but so are many other people who‚Äôs experience they ruin by having a bad connection but this is also super manipulative to achieve. People easy ruin there own connection to benefit in the game. Something needs to be done about bad connection because it kills the game, especially in competitive areas
---
Only master counts for time trials.
---
You can slide through those. I think I've done it a few times but it was a little tricky for me with the timing of the jump.
---
There's +,-, ZL, and ZR in there. And, the face buttons are listed as B, A, Y, X. Which is different than A, B, X, Y on the Xbox controller.
---
Wow great shot! How do you remove the UI completely? Is there a hotkey?
---
For me he was that cool older brother that you never got to meet again for certain circumstances
---
Using Crimil‚Äôs Dagger (or any 110 with Opening Shot) ended up being great for the Thorn quest, too. Just a different playstyle.
---
as in 951 power stuff
---
Guys please help, we might all be in danger!

Destiny 1 had a lot of build up in TTK and RoI. Then D2 had a whole planet dedicated to him (Nessus). Also the adventures have logs with him leading and a bunch of lore.
---
Cya back in the Crucible farm!
---
It will only do exotics from forsaken and earlier, it won't drop exotics from shadowkeep
---
I
---
I used the Jade Rabbit to destroy the Jade Rabbit.
---
Yeah, *what about me?* I don't have a mic lol :P
---
Iam a avatar player trying to get recluse any tips thanks
---
So you have to wait for the rotation of each forge. As for the keys, Bungie said to not use the key molds because the quest is bugged again. So I would hold off on doing this quest till it‚Äôs like fully fixed.
---
In the beginning of Destiny 1
---
The last 2 weeks I got what I already had, this week finally gave something I didnt have

38 days as of right now!
---
No, it would be a Wholedan-E
---
Because you have all the others available in the engram. Press Y on it and you‚Äôll see the loot pool.
---
What **didnt/did** you do to lose them?
---
Thats why recluse is so good. Also while yes I agree there is always going to be a good loadout but pinnacle weapons completely overshadow any other legendary and even most exotics bar a few. It isn't fun whatsoever.
---
After all... why shouldn‚Äôt I keep it
---
Thought the build was top tree.
---
I would suggest you just watch a YouTube video. Easiest way to understand it.
---
THIS IS AMAZING!
---
I grazed a kids ear in gym/PE and the assistant principle gave me detention because the child over reacted.
---
I see no God up here
---
Why do you need that gun for the Undying title?
---
Still though I know i dont have all my titan armour, would've been nice to finally get a one eyed but nooooope heres another trinity ghoul.
---
Fighting lion is also the only primary ammo grenade launcher, and as long as you kill things, it's hard to be short on ammo.
---
Change characters.....
---
Game on buddy.
---
Lol I think cleaning up around the house would work better
---
Thank
---
We played two very different expansions.
---
Well, I read I was supposed to, but then there was an option unser quests just called "the main quest"
---
Me standing up for a presentation: please don-
---
My dick:
---
So is that an i or nah
---
It worked for me after completing the "Discover the EDZ" quest
---
did you open this on a titan?
---
Wait... this is illegal.
---
Any reasons why?
---
Grazed a kid's ear? 
---
Elaborate please.
---
Is the kid on the soccer team?
---
Gotta use the Engram on a titan then.
---
you need to open it on a titan to get titan exotics
---
nah, it can drop all Y2 exotics
---
In gym i gave him a friendly ear tickle
---
you need to open it on the character that needs something
---
You will be able to buy the full Pass if you want. 
---
But this option is not available yet (it was available by accident). So you can't do it right now.
---
As it will be around 100 Silver per Rank, it shouldn't be that much if you already have a certain amount of ranks.
---
Someone please translate, I'm American
---
i guess but i got mountaintop done within a day back before they made it easier
---
Lunas Howl
---
the loot pool is kinda misleading. Well, the shown loot pool is basically irrelevant.
---
Say you still need OEM and it's the last exotic you need from Y1 and Y2. Even if it doesn't show OEM when you preview it you will still get OEM
---
Correct I bought a couple of ranks when it was so that‚Äôs why I ask. When will this be available?
---
[deleted]
---
We are not unfortunately, I'm sorry friend
---
I meant forsaken as in year 2 of destiny 2 I meant the whole year, should have been clearer
---
Nicely done.
---
One sorta locks on like the sight doesn't have to be directly on the revolver no just kinda normal
---
World drop exotics can drop anywhere in the game world. From almost any enemy.
---
light level doesn't matter except in iron banner, some guns are better than others because of their archetype's fire rate, damage, time to kill etc but in the end it all depends on what you're comfortable with. Even back when handcannons ruled crucible, i still sucked ass with them. just find something you like and roll with it, unless you're trying for a pinnacle weapon or something, in which case just tough out the grind.
---
well, Warframe wasn't installed so I'm doing that, but in the mean time I've updated overwatch.
---
it's a bit edgy, bounces sometimes (players teleport a few meters away) but it goes quite well...
---
As for spects as in mods ain't looked
---
No it‚Äôs just a weird glitch me and my friend never played momentum control and it appears it‚Äôs not important tho just a off glitch
---
Imagine the thrall telling you not to use recluse in strikes and actually listening to them XD
---
Oh that's a rip thanks tho
---
More reason for you to try it. I wont spoil the fun for you.
---
Yeah this is like exactly the same as saying ‚ÄúI got a Prime Engram from *blank*‚Äù, yeah they come from literally everywhere
---
Thanks for the clarification. I definitely need to change what I am doing because I dismantle everything that isn't of immediate use. 
---
... this does make the game even more of *Inventory Simulator 2020* though.
---
There is a gun called "outbreak perfected." I don't think it's that common, but I don't watch a lot of youtube videos about this game. You can find a wide variety of guides showing how to get it, but most of them will not say how to actually start the quest, only how to do it once you have started it. [How to start the quest.](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/bmruj0/fallen_transponderzero_hour_frequently_asked/)
---
Fright night is earned through a quest.
---
It's a *Super*, not an ult. This isn't League of Legends.
---
And your bullets and grenades don't pass through your fireteam members either.
---
Spacial awareness. If your Super keeps hitting someone in front of you, that's a you problem.
---
After you do the strike, gambit, and crucible intro quests, each corresponding NPC should have a selection of quests for you to choose from.
---
Yup ya' got it. You don't even have to complete New Light you can play with your bud immediately.
---
Yes, this is normal. As 50% of the comments in the new player sticky say, the year 1 campaigns don't give item rewards any more. 
---
[How to get every exotic.](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1881576082)
---
At the very right hand hand side of the weapons details, so to the right of the different sights and barrels theres (if were talking about the service revolver) two different nodes next to each other called traits or perks, im not sure which and they can be things like rampage which, each time you get a kill your weapon deals more damage and that stacks 3 times, outlaw, which significantly increases reload speed when you get an persicion kill, and this are apart of a system called random rolling
---
I‚Äôm not brand new. Pretty sure I did all these intro quests at launch and also some stuff at forsaken launch but never enough to understand. The quests I‚Äôve had so far are like year one exotic quests for some reason
---
It is basically an ult, and a lot of the one time shots are giant orbs. In Gambit, when you are all standing in a tiny circle, it is super easy to hit your team with your ult, especially as a new player. But I feel you, I'll git gud.
---
Exotics no longer drop as story mission rewards. That also means you won't choose from riskrunner, sunshot, or graviton lance like in vanilla.
---
Resetting my ps4  licenses fixed it for me
---
I honestly got excited only cause my gf loves Iron Banner more than anything and I was gonna tell her haha.
---
On PS4. Just restored licenses in settings and it‚Äôs working now.
---
Yeah okay I'll take a look one of my beginning guns had rampage
---
That‚Äôs exactly where I got mine.
---
Grinding for exit strategy make me want to commit homicide
---
The long schlong
---
Play momentum control. Got it over 2 days of casual play
---
Yea thats a great perk, once you get to later light levels perks become really important to how a weapon performs
---
Thanks a ton for the help!
---
You are still helping me even though we are not on the same platform
---
Okay thanks I'll try it. Any weapon suggestions for it?
---
I left to Orbit and cane back in.
---
Thanks for trying to help, btw.
---
Nice!!
---
I just got liars handshake. I think it‚Äôs year 3 because I didn‚Äôt have it so thank you
---
It‚Äôs just a visual bug.
---
Being a hunter main, I was surprised to see all the utility the Warlock has. So many options from the trees alone.
---
Tostitos FTW! Nice costume too!
---
Nope, were taken out the game with new light, can't talk to them anymore either
---
I hate these guys who plays the raid to the last encounter, and then say ok lets do it again on a second char, the boss is too hard.
---
I mean... wtf?
---
r/phalanxed
---
Only great thing about forsaken for me so far is now as a Titan I can throw a small hammer and pick it back up, and I am now a beyblade
---
As a former Warrior DPS on Tera, this suits me perfectly lmao
---
Me does nothing but throws Grenades,Are you not entertained!
---
boring and offensive
---
Oh...okay...thanks for the info
---
Forsaken is easily the best expansion of the previous two years, with Warmind being a short but sweet second expansion. Curse of Osiris is easily the worst of the bunch, but does have a great side mission when you complete all the Prophecy weapons
---
Idk who that is but fuck em. I'm here for the Ws. If my loadout is cancer to you, counter me and beat me.
---
Because half the time you have a team that only want to invade and literally don‚Äôt collect motes or fight or anything and it‚Äôs a waste of time and effort.
---
It‚Äôs long its shitty and people have to grind it for many things
---
It wants ‚Äúthe last word‚Äù
---
Its ok, id loom for anything but subsistence though
---

Funny enough Bungie does dish out PvP mode bans for poor internet connection, first you get several warnings after that comes a two month suspension and if you keep trying to play without solving your internet problems you get banned permanently. In my book that is fair.
---
"edgy" and "cool" according to the OP, I guess.
---
Nope, but I see why you‚Äôd say that, I mean if I had no cogent argument I‚Äôd just deflect to that instantly too, as to mask the lack of any form of logic
---
Is this for pvp or pve
---
Thank you. I was hoping that if this was an issue that Bungie knows about it already.
---
Oh shit is it those raisins? That gets you them if so I‚Äôll get that done.
---
Ok...doesn‚Äôt contradict anything I said
---
I like going around with my HUD off and taking screenshots of my guardian sitting down somewhere pretty, D2 makes for some amazing screensavers
---
Chap has a max range of about 14m
---
Unfortunately not. Last new enemy of d1 was siva, which created the exotic pulse rifle. Outbreak perfected. The iron lord sealed the door but it opened and then the plot of rise of iron was going to seal up siva again and shut down the arcons forge. Good story, good gameplay. Overall, the only reason the scorn had that weapon was because of uldren, who I assume crafted it or stole it from the dreaming city. That is why it is expected for uldren to fill cydes shoes in the next game or future dlc. Uldren created the weapon to kill cayde and in doing that, he will be the replacement. It was a decent move to do it that way as well. The voice actor who was behind cayde had his contract ended and bundle did not renew it.
---
What? What implication do you get from this that I was angry?
---
Also what retardation is that statement, ‚Äúyeah dude you get angry? You suck‚Äù
---
Is it possible to find discourse on this subreddit or just deflections and 3rd grade logic?
---
Do you have instagram or snapchat? It would make it easier for us to talk to each other
---
5100? That‚Äôs oddly specific
---
You must be missing something, I had trouble with that wall too; khakis hd did a vid with the combination but I finally after 3 tries just followed what they did in the video and ignored the combination he said
---
After the scout rifle kills I actually forgot how to play normally. First few comp games were rough.
---
Yeah, the grind isn't hard or long, you just can't keep going after 3,600 dust. Just hop on one of your other characters and do a few strikes, crucible or Gambit matches and boom, +1,200 dust.
---
But anyway, congrats on getting the cat ghost, and don't mind the haters who say you are lying (I don't even get why they say you are lying, like, why make a post and claim you bought something for dust when you bought it for silver, what do you even get from doing that?).
---
(P.s, don't forget the broom sparrow should be up for dust next week or the week after :) )
---
Well legend is all I need to get to. Which is 5100+
---
Yes it‚Äôs a glitch bungie and some youtubers have already brought it up. I saw it happen to a poor Titan that had me dead to rights but instead he got sniped lol
---
[stormy vibes](https://media2.giphy.com/media/3o84sq21TxDH6PyYms/giphy.gif)

Seriously. Fucking asinine.
---
Yeet.
---
Picked it up about 2 weeks after launch, kills and glory was easy, medals was frustrating until I found out about cold fusion medals
---
He's one of the only characters that has an alluring personality and bungie did a lot of marketing with him so that's why he's pretty popular.
---
I'm completely new and idk what's going on, can you guys help me out
---
To be honest I wasn't a huge fan of scouts and was doing it for the seal more then anything but after having to kill 450 Gaurdians with a scout I have to say they have grown on me. It is a very fun scout to use.
---
I think the skill based matchmaking in comp is finally starting to work how it was intended. I'm backmto getting regular glory for wins and losses now that I am up over 3500. Before that it was like 200+ glory for a win. And matches have finally become interesting. Very few blowouts. Anlot of fun close ones.
---
It's Hasapiko
---
I been asking on Twitter to see If bungie can confirm if the triumph is bugged or not. Still waiting on them for a response for a few days. They probably wont lol.
---
It doesn't show in the battlenet list of games or anywhere on the launcher that I can see. I can run the game from the file, but it won't let me get past title screen obviously. So I know it's still installed, so I don't want to just delete the files.
---
Yeah! Anything specific you need help with?
---
I'm not sure how I pulled this off too, but mine is at -2, giving me 14 total mods. I showed my buddies and they're losing their minds, but I honestly have no clue how I did this.
---
You could try to use the windows application manager, throw up a quick google search on how to get there and it should walk you through it. I‚Äôm not 100% on what you need to search for it and I don‚Äôt want to give you misinformation
---
Its part of the same chain I believe
---
Ah. Thanks. ü§ò
---
 [u/Pugsta05](https://www.reddit.com/user/Pugsta05/)  How the hell did you forget about the vaper??
---
All you get is bright engrams once you get up to 5 ranks after hitting 100. So you'll get one at 105, 110, 115, etc.
---
I'm trying to do some backtracking because I try to record a lot of things I do, cause I too have "bonus mods" putting me at -2, so 14 mods total. I'll see what I can find out
---
Hey man, a guardians gotta do what a guardians gotta do haha! I remember last night I was like, "damn I cant wait to try this out on kb+m" lol
---
The squeakers are the worst. Instant leave for me if they can't shut up.
---
Hmm, I enlncounter more weed than vape while raiding
---
Aw you can tell hes trying too. Mad props if you came up with the idea to help him fell better. Anything positive in someones negative world can make some small or big impacts. Im terrible at typing so sorry if that makes no sense. Im just happy to see someone going through a rough time havinga good time
---
Yes
---
Me to lol
---
I cannot understand you people. Why don‚Äôt you play CS GO if you want to hardscope lanes and one shot everyone?
---
So this covers one guy, where are the rest?
---
I think you have to have done the cosmodrome and then gotten to power level 770
---
I have to agree. I really didnt care for scouts until this season because I was forced to use them lol but RTK is def my favorite scout so far!
---
Ah! That worked thanks ... can't believe I didn't even think to look in there.
---
Dem cheeks
---
I'm 910 power and am done all but Forsaken and Shadowkeep, been playing for about a year. Tower is normal for me still. Glitch? Update needed?
---
I'm the high dude üòÇ. But I do know what's goin on.

Would upvote but 420

Edit: nvm

no problem

I'm the "*DON'T DIE*" guy when I play insurgency... but it's not about spamming it all the time... it's all about the *timing*. Being silent for like 5 minutes during a solo clutch; and just popping in with a "**DON'T DIE**" while they are getting killed to death, is a nonzero amount of enjoyment for me.
---
More accurate title: PLEASE BREAK THE GAME AGAIN*
---
They have had everything to be unstoppable since launch, so yeah
---
Who cares it‚Äôs just glory earned not the fabled rank, heaven forbid people have to be good to get pinnacle weapons
---
Those high impact scouts/pulse rifles are deadly in momentum.  I think a lot of those long range fights can turn to Randy's favor if they miss the initial kill shot (head shot).  Otherwise, there isn't much you can do.   
---
But it is awesome in regular playlists.  It just melts people so quick and the barrage of bullets messes with the opponent's accuracy.  But there is recoil while pumping out bullets.  I found myself barely missing shots quite often so I had to dump kill clip in favor of zen moment.  Everything has been great since then.
---
I don't even like to use recluse. Much rather my Luna's (controller player) 
---
I miss the year 1 days of uriels gift. I got one from failsafe the other day and was like damn. This used to be a great weapon.
---
Ironically this is  also my reasoning for thinking the name of Love and Hate has meaning to me...
---
You should go for it. Vex cosplay would be insane
---
I like how you said "attempted" as if it wasn't the greatest costume
---
You won't receive the rewards.
---
After 6 shots, he had seen enough for one lifetime
---
Doing jump puzzles in D2 feels like im trying to do them in my dreams.
---
As Fighting Lion is a one hit kill you are much more likely to get medals in momentum control, yes iron banner gives you extra progress but getting the medals in the first place is a pain in regular crucible. So it probably balances out.
---
Can you see?
---
Do you know if i can complete the title well after the season ends so long as the triumphs related to the time-gated content were finished prior?
---
Ends November 19th
---
You just changed my whole mindset. I got tilted this morning from witnessing a firing squad of Jade Rabbits camping, but I'm happy to have helped them get Randy's.
---
So its per season then.. rip me
---
Getting to the 9th branch in the Haunted Forest isn't too hard
---
The raid isn't too hard
---
Playing Iron Banner is super easy 
---
Master nightmare is very hard indeed, and so is this weeks Nightfall
---
My dumbass: wtf is Bringers Shadow?
---
Squash that fat boi
---
Has been a long time since sidearms were relevant anywhere.
---
I‚Äôve been using it in PvP lately. Having some fun with it.
---
Very late, but i use the curated braytech werewolf, combined with loaded question and whisper of the worm.
---
The only amendment I would make is for Gambit Prime exclusively; Try not to be the first people to bank, and always try to bank at the same time as someone else, or when there is already a blocker up. Requires a bit of watching your teammates. Multiple blockers at one time drain the bank, so pairing a 5 with another 5 can be more potent for motes than continuing to gather and waiting until you have 10. Not impossible to get an effective deposit of 15+ from dropping a 5 because of the drain in Prime.
---
As far as the first deposit goes, you're playing a bit of chicken with the other team. Watching their "available to deposit" bar on the HUD. You dont want to deposit first, so that you can drain them, unless they're about to be able to deposit 25+ and hit you with an invasion. At that point it becomes a "bank them or lose them". It could be argued that as soon as your team can do 25+ in one go, to deposit and invade - but making that decision really relies on watching what your teammates have decided to do. I prefer to wait until the last moment against the other teams ability to invade.
---
‚ÄúYou can put your rock in my maps now. I won‚Äôt need them anymore.‚Äù
---
Just be happy that you don't have to do the entire red war campaign

40+ in 3v3. 150+ in 6s

---
Doesn't it say that it increases the weapon drop rate in the pit?
---
If your talking about trove guardian, he has another spawn point that switches per week. Its somewhere north if I remember correctly.
---
No prob dude! I‚Äôm not a mod or anything, just watching out for my fellow guardians (the guy in your post IS an idiot tho lmao)
---
Oh man, please tell me you have a collection of Eris research material you could share.. I uh. Have some desires.
---
Yeah its a no. Has to be in a normal match
---
I think it's around the hellmouth, which I'm aware of. This is the only one where i know where the path spawns, though.

Get your rock, off my map

I feel this on an emotional level

Schweeet
---
As the high dude I have to disagree, for me it‚Äôs getting side tracked and winding up in the wrong area (GoS and SotP each and every)
---
I‚Äôm pretty good with Scathe, I am out rifle ‚Äúalmost‚Äù anyone. The best perks for an AR to have is anything that helps with stability, recoil or sway. An AR with either Zen Moment, Dynamic Sway Reduction is a must. Or one with both of them... near a God Tier roll. Usually the AR‚Äôs with 600 rounds per minute is the Goldilocks zone I think lol.
---
This week he spawns on the hellmouth near where the portal public event happens
---
Until they get their hand held super nova
---
Idk, maybe I'm just not that good with it because I just felt it was a bit under powered at range, I can control recoil, but it hits hard at smg range and well.. I'd rather have the recluse or pillager for that lol cool gun tho and was RIDICULOUSLY OP in d1
---
Resilience is probably the last thing you want... 
---
intellect and recovery/mobility are great stats
---
You should look for armor with a total of around 60 if you want a really good armor.
---
The armor element depends on what mods you use and what weapons you use
---
Look in the wiki for information, which element is for what weapons
---
Edit:
---
Raids often give great high stat armor, as does the hardest nightfall ordeal

The recluse needs nerfed because it's fucking busted. I can probably count on one hand how many times I've been pissed off by the Recluse in PvP. It's strong in PvP sure, but that's also not why anyone complains about it
