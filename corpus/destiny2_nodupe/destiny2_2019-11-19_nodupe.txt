Ssssshhh, don't talk about my tactic out loud
---
---
---
They down vote you just for even mentioning OEM, that's how weak their game is
---
I thirteenth this
---
Don't confuse the season pass with any events going on. Holiday events like festival of the lost are available for everyone.
---

---
The vex offensive plus some other odds and ends is what comes with the season pass.
---
For a moment I thought you had 2 last words and I was super confused.
---
Wtf is happening. So freaking weird.
---
Since I posted this I‚Äôve gained like three or four followers. Welcome to the club!
---
Leave Mike O'Tren alone, his piss makes me stronger
---
If you're new light, i don't think you have access to the last wish raid. So you'd have to find another place where are a lot of enemies are stacked together. Then shoot your shadowshot at them (i used top tree void) and then shoot them with your eriana.
---
Can't let warlocks have anything can you?
---
Straif glide is best movement skill in the game. Change my mind.
---
[deleted]
---
Yeah, you‚Äôre full of it. First off, we were talking about recluse as a crutch weapon because all you have to do is get a kill, and then you can go on a rampage where you murder anyone instantly without needing to aim. 
---
Also, your claim of the last word having a faster ttk is just plain wrong. Hitting all headshots, last word has a ttk of .53. Meanwhile with recluse having master of arms procced, using body shots or headshots since it doesn‚Äôt matter. So not only is recluse mathematically better with the perk, its more forgiving too. 
---
And I laughed at your thing about glory. I soloed my way to 3100 in season of the drifter, and am about to hit 4000 this season. Not to mention you can watch any streamer at 5500, and every game you will see at least a couple recluse.
---
WHY ARE YOU RUNNING!
---
I just learned never rush the boss kill.
---
Im still not above 150 because i get teams that get shit on by lunas every fucking game. Or arc staff that one hits every other fucking super. Its bonkers.
---
Tying yourself down to the PvP meta loadouts tends to suck it out more since you're relying on something you know is advantageous against most casual players. In my mind, people who complain about people not using the meta in comp are people who put more effort into getting final blows on already weakened players (kill stealing in general) so they can boast about how they're a god in PvP.
---
In the end, it sucks out the fun for everyone because most people would rather rely on near broken loadouts and complain about people who would rather use loadouts they feel comfortable using.
---
Omg so filthy
---
Hey wait... the last word is the golden gun
---
i do have shadowkeep and foresaken sorry.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs solid metal, brass maybe? It‚Äôs really well made and has some weight to it. And yeah when you put it that way, it seems reasonable, given that they have to have them custom made through a manufacturer.
---
Almost like 3 you tubers already made this into a video..
---
This set is amazing! Do you mind if I ask where these locations are, if it's not too much trouble?
---
I feel threatened
---
Wow! Nice job :)
---
Idk if the phone you're using is from 1995, but i use an S7 edge with chrome browser and if i click on it, the picture enlarges and i can see the whole thing.
---
I don‚Äôt agree, because LITERALLY Savathun responded to the Shattered Throne clear by saying ‚Äúyour win is my win‚Äù.  The lore very clearly seems to lean way more in his direction. Not to brown nose but the guy doesn‚Äôt seem to be under educated on the way the story is unfolding.
---
Ilthis takes commitment
---
Nooo kidding! At least collecting exotic weapons isn't a major part of the game so it's not a huge kick in the crotch..
---
Like what?
---
Holy shiet - I want.
---
How do you get it I have been running the daily adventure once a day for about two weeks

I'm a titan. This is great üòÇüòÇ

Randy‚Äôs range isn‚Äôt really good for sitting in the back of the map. More of a mid-range contender. All of this was for naught

---
&gt;Yeah, you‚Äôre full of it. First off, we were talking about recluse as a crutch weapon because all you have to do is get a kill, and then you can go on a rampage where you murder anyone instantly without needing to aim.
---
Oof, I can't take anything you say seriously when this is your actual argument. Let's be honest, you haven't gotten anywhere in comp on PC, otherwise you'd be right and not wrong. Facts don't lie, Recluse is not meta, and is NOT used at high levels. The reason it isn't meta because most people never proc the perk, and when they do, they do NOT go on a rampage- it's survival for fucks sake, there's only 2 other people you idiot. And guess what, when the perk isn't active the TTK is only .73s WITH CRITS. And we all know that you aren't going to, so it's close to .9s or above.
---
&gt;And I laughed at your thing about glory. I soloed my way to 3100 in season of the drifter, and am about to hit 4000 this season. Not to mention you can watch any streamer at 5500, and every game you will see at least a couple recluse.
---
No you haven't. Apparently it was a different comment I replied to and not you, but I'm in Mythic III. You can't just make up random shit and believe that I'm actually going to fall for it. If you were actually in the mid 3000s then you would see how little Recluses there are, and how it is NOT meta compared to TLW and Pulses. I don't team up or anything, just play solo with the new changes they made with matchmaking. I learned a lot, and most of it is that Reddit is real fucking bad at PvP.
---
An add is anything that you laugh at and don't waste the good ammo when there's 1-5 of them, that will suddenly, during a boss fight when you're trying to get to cover from the Shrieker spam and the Ogre has just noticed you and the Hunter's had a misadventure, suddenly appear in groups of no less than ten billion and say HOW YA LIKE US NOW, PUNK
---
And they don‚Äôt stop coming and they don‚Äôt stop coming and they don‚Äôt stop coming and they don‚Äôt stop coming‚Ä¶
---
Still remember the good old days of the Coldheart meta...
---
That's because Lord shaxx, sounds like me.
---
That's Bob, the Unstoppable-in-training. It's his first day; the guys are showing him the ropes.
---
The warlock jump takes finesse if you don't main them then yea your not going to like the jump, but after maiming them from d1 and d2 I can say without a shadow of doubt that their jump is the best because it in operates both other classes, the burst glide is kind of like catapult and blink it more or less a fancier hunter jump
---
Days later, your argument has merit I suppose but it‚Äôs not like usage means anything. Nerf recluse and then what? Something else replaces it. People are interested in the best most efficient way of doing things. There are exceptions of course but no one is forcing the community to use Recluse. 
---
If you‚Äôre getting wrecked by it in Crucible you will 100% still be getting destroyed by something else. If you‚Äôre bad at crucible you‚Äôre not magically going to be good later. In pve no one is forcing you to use Recluse and in fact if someone else uses it that‚Äôs ok. I will still run it where appropriate and people on my raid team will continue to run their Loaded Question and whatever else. 
---
What denial do you think I‚Äôm living in? I don‚Äôt want it nerfed in PVE because it allows me to run my loaded that fits my playstyle. I‚Äôm not looking to do something different every few months. If I want to clear out an island on sanctified mind in 10 seconds I should be able to. 
---
I don‚Äôt get what you‚Äôre hoping to achieve. You won‚Äôt convince me that it needs to be nerfed in PVE. There‚Äôs nothing that‚Äôs broken by its use. Hard content is still challenging. If you‚Äôre dying in crucible to it a lot I‚Äôm sorry but again I‚Äôm just not sure you understand how to beat it. I don‚Äôt really care who uses it there because I see most people not even using it skillfully. When I see that? Doesn‚Äôt matter what they use, they‚Äôre getting clowned on.
---
YEAAAAAAHHHHH BOIIIIIIII!!!!!!!!
---
Huh? I've never heard anyone say that. The more ya know
---
put it this way back in d1 i had to get 68 wins str8 on my flawless card to get the first scarab emblem to drop i was no slouch by any means. Frostbolt 1 v 3ed us... the man was surgical with lightning nades and  his quick thinking, never botched a 3 tap hc kill. He is a beast period. It dont matter where he plays.
---
I uninstalled and reinstalled and it worked for me. I had nothing all weekend
---
Really just depends on your playstyle, wether you like using scout rifles in general. But yes it is a good general purpose gun, not meta breaking but good.
---
Was wondering wth was up with all the Tel'taks
---
He isn't trying to push his views on others. He is trying to use logic with what lore he has collected. If u don't like his videos, don't watch them. U aren't required to.
---
it can with sun warrior, empowering rift, inertia override tho... hunters need quick access thing or the animation canceling swap for this build.
---
Yyyyyeah, I'm paranoid... I always have all counters for any potential spawns. Overload bow, barrier autorifle, joy buzzer punch and Ahamkara's hands that give you two melee charges. BRING IT, JERKS.
---
I keep feeling the temptation to run Voidlock with the FU Grenades mod, but you know that will be the one time no one else has Kamehameha Punch ready
---
I hit legend with top tree dawn but  sure it's garbage and needs buffs!
---
My bad for the late response, but I'd suggest either joining a clan that is willing to help a new light get into raiding, or join the destiny lfg discord for sherpa runs
---
Very trash
---
Yep, you‚Äôre an idiot and it shows. When presented with anything you just bury your head in the sand. 
---
And I could care less if you believe I‚Äôm high glory or not, but I have every comp gun and the new ghost shell you can only get at mythic and above.
---
Wait this happened LMAO All fortnite streamers join D2 and get smashed and the call hacks
---
its good for soloing nightfalls to deal with multiple types of champions alone.
---
yeah, and even then a lot of that bad was due to his corruption made worse through manipulation. aside from being a bit of an asshole, there‚Äôs nothing about his character that was inherently villainous
---
Hecuba has a prism effect, the broom has a smoke trail, the one with the cat skull on the front has a trail of fire. There's a bunch of them.
---
I started salivating like a saint bernard by the end of writing this
---
Warlock 'hunger' build is a pretty fun build for grenades. You have to sacrifice one at the start (if you don't have a melee target around) but once you start feasting with 'hunger' your grenade recharges some with every kill. Back in the day I used to run strikes using hunger where I would have more grenade kills than my teammates would have kills in general.
---
I don't exactly know if there is a "best build" but some have more function than others when you get to end game. It used to be 'well of radiance' warlocks were heavily desired when it came to raiding. They got nerfed a bit so I'm sure they are still important just no longer beloved by their raid team (sad face). If I had to choose three supers for our fireteam it would be well of radiance, Pathfinder tether, and golden gun.
---
I personally like the builds that make my teammates and (more importantly) myself stronger. Stuff like warlock well of radiance and hunters tether will be a little more viable and important anytime in the game as it helps the entire raid/fire team.

[According to this post back in D1](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/4m5xpw/actual_sizes_metric_of_all_exotic_weapons/) The Last Word is 486mm long. That's about 1'7", about as long as the length from your elbow to your fingertips on average.
---
TLW also uses 17mm caliber bullets. To put that in perspective, .50 cal bullets are 13mm in diameter. Really puts the term "Hand Cannon" into perspective.
---

dont know why but this is hilarious lmao
---
Same here. If you can't help someone through a raid and just get mad, maybe you are not good enough. I think the saying goes like: You know something good enough when you can teach it to someone else. That's the mindset I take at least ü§∑
---
No. Just no. If that was the case think of how stupid the Crucible would be. Honestly just make a swords only game Mode.
---
It would be fun but far from broken. There's no reason I should throw myself at a boss for 3 swipes if my fireteam can just fullcourt/spikenade  and out dps me.
---
Swordbois for life
---
Dang that's why I like astrocyte on lock, by the time I troll and escape, by the time people find me I'm usually ripe and ready for round 2.
---
rip, I'm on PS4. Good luck out there lol
---
What PE has nightmares? I havent been on in a while
---
of course that would mean dumb down dmg u expect it to has special ammo and one shot?
---
3 swipes? Do you know what sword guard is?
---
Stronghold: *Am I a Joke to you?!*
---
Stronghold guard blocks out physics too, you can wail away on a boss for all the damage ever if you want, also throne cleaver is best cleaver, better than grenades in some cases, especially the Deception fight, all your attacks land and the damage buff isn‚Äôt necessary to be cool nor is the reload buff
---
I was on D1 a few hours ago and I was surprised that there were new players in the tower, like damn.
---
idk his prepare to cry series will always hold a special place in the lore area of my heart. especially his artiorias and sif video.
---
In what way? You press a button on your pc/ console, vs taking out your phone to record it.
---
Bring back old Iron Banner armor
---
Then what does that make swords good for in PvE? You obviously didn't think this through. Just make a swords only game mode and everyone has extra Shield to make it interesting.
---
Poor hunters lol
---
There as never been a show or movie the internet has given less of a fuck about spoiling than this one and the strangest thing is no one is upset. Everyone who would be is watching and everyone being spoiled is possibly being drawn in. It‚Äôs a miracle.
---
Fuck Scorn, they deal dummy damage. Also the Recluse makes Vex matches easy.
---
There's lore in this game?
---
Yep! Luckily I wasn‚Äôt grinding specifically for him so I didn‚Äôt waste too much time. When I was curious why I hadn‚Äôt received it yet, cause I had reset my rank twice already, I found that out. He appeared in like the 3rd gambit game so I didn‚Äôt have to play for very long
---
shotgun, special ammo finder, shotgun scavenger can make you more lethal at close range than a sword
---
There's a reason people don't run swords in PvP and it's not the limited Heavy drops
---
What about 980s? almost every run or two has something that drops
---
No. Making them special weapons is a dumb idea.
---
Imagine an ornament that doesn't involve rubber tights
---
u do know pve and pvp can have different dmg modifier right?

Since last night I‚Äôve noticed a lot more contacting destiny server pop ups

It was very strongly implied that when Rasputin "shot down" the traveller, Rasputin made ghosts to somehow channel Light

I need to read more on this though, could be wrong

It could do a weekly rotation of highlights from the last week in low resolution in a blue version of grayscale that matches the colors of the screens there now. A one minute compilation of 5-10 second clips on each screen without sound wouldn't be large files compared to modern AAA game assets.
---
They could even add an option to get a single Crucible token for holding the interaction button to have your Guardian watch and cheer if they do it for the full length of the loop once a week. They could even do a soundboard of Shaxx making generic comments on what the clips are showing to mix up his Tower banter.

You are a fantastic person.
---
Aww sorry your pissed about your training wheels being taken away
---
I'm sorry you had such a bad experience with raiding.
---
The scolding is definitely an ass move. But referring to himself in 3rd person is actually a good thing in LFG raids. Since saying "Me" or "I will" doesn't help anyone in the team because nobody knows you by voice. 
---
This coming from someone trying to sherpa and had to constantly ask the question "Who's Me?"
---
Hey at least I am trying
---
It‚Äôs the Intrepid Discovery Vest ornament with the gambit emerald shader on it.
---
no it is not , is a big black box that spawn near the forge
---
Im so glad this exists
---
Yes got booted from a comp match, still annoying the game blames you. \~I have gigabit with no issues on my end.
---
Yeah the trueskill thing is weird.
---
I feel like some of the energy hand cannons are not actually revolvers (in terms of mechanics), but weapons that 'evolved' from revolvers and now they are using some kind of battery or container instead of bullets. BTW does Sunshot have a revolving animation?
---
Well the base game is FREE just like everyone fucking told you.
---
When does this message appear?

Epstein didn‚Äôt kill himself?
---
Since it would be difficult to stream entire matches what if it had a list that would keep scrolling with the feeds of matches. Like, ‚ÄúX killed y with z gun‚Äù from one match, and ‚Äúx fell to their death‚Äù from another. Just a continuous scrolling Of the feed
---
You reload tho, I‚Äôm sure it would‚Äôve showcased it more if you didn‚Äôt

You wait for it to come around in the daily rotation of forges.

Great book.
---
Three words, you bloody titan. Three.
---
Agreed. Its not going anywhere, it will do less damage but still... Just now you have to aim for the head and not the hapless spray and pray.  
---

Yeah, because 3 void shields totally need 3 recluses to take down.

Shaxx‚Äôs handcannon is typically assumed to be Fatebringer, or one of the Devil handcannons. As far as I‚Äôm aware it is unknown.

It can't be a Devil, the model looks different.... Maybe it IS a fate ringer design.

Any bag is bad. No matter how justified it may be. He shouldn't have started it, but finishing it makes you just as bad as him.

Like you said; they wanted a reaction, and a reaction they received. Next time don't give em the satisfaction.
---
why not just use Izanagi burden with recluse and love and death. boom the most meta loadout you can physically get while still using weapon mods. dont have recluse? thats ok just use reckless oracle aka the gun when a recluse meets that cute girl called having actual ammo reserves.
---
I'm not saying that people should yell at each other, but sometimes you have to be firm and tell someone who absolutely refuses to conform how it's going to have to be.  Someone who keeps trying to say or do something ridiculous that constantly causes the fail needs to be put in their place or the raid will never continue.
---
An example is the sanctified mind with tethers.  People for some reason love trying to bring tethers up and over walls, needing to jump and stay in mid air when it just keeps breaking line of sight.  It won't work and I don't care if it worked once before, it keeps causing wipes.  Eventually you just have to force it into their heads that they are the problem and they have to change.
---
because?
---
Oxygen SR3, what's that? I only see 7 enhancement cores.
---
Beautiful snipes
---
yes and no. the base gun has that perk already, what the catalyst really brings to the table is the fact kills count as a reload, and each kill adds ammo to the mag, meaning more kills=bigger mag=more dakka=more death. unless the devs changed it.
---
I‚Äôm that asshole that almost always has tether up to rip people out of super, why? Cause fuck you and your roaming super that‚Äôs why. I mainly due this to OEM, mtntop, recluse dbags though so if you aren‚Äôt one of those guys I try and snipe you with it from across the map(hilarious to do it in mayhem).
---
imagine savathun coming to invade the last city only to see zavala pull up with this
---
Its all about the building and the boss teather
---
I‚Äôm going for it since I‚Äôm already going for unbroken. Otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt bother.
---
As a Raid Leader, if you know you fucked something up, that means we're making progress.
---
You just have to have equipped it at any point. It takes into account the highest light level you‚Äôve had, and goes from there
---
wrong

it wont affect anyone

That‚Äôs the big blind ornament currently only available via silver.

I used this guy for the longest time. I still think it has really good handling.

---
One time during vault I had a guy who had told me he was up for being a reader but he kept messing up so my solution was to just switch him to just killing mobs but still ghost the actual reader while rock and stairs would work together defending his plate. After 2 runs of him ghosting he asked if he could give it a shot and we almost cleared it aside from a completely unrelated wipe and then cleared it the run after that.
---
Point is not everyone learns the same so being outright hostile can push people away from raids. As someone who took from 3 months prior to the launch of rise of iron till about 4 months before shadowkeep launch to finally do their first raid out of the anxiety of just messing things up and getting yelled at I think it's really helpful to just take a different approach. And even if they just cant figure it out there will always be a job of just mob killing in almost all encounters for them to do.

Uh, the thing is, throwing games is literally the only way the game's horrendous Elo system will actually do anything. The game judges you based on personal performance, not the performance of your team or even whether you win the games or not. You have to be on a really long streak of basically 0 efficiency before the game decides it should be putting you on teams against anything but OEM god titans on a 183 win streak. Most people I know actually throw every second or third game specifically in order to avoid said system. Yeah, it's infuriating when you're trying to win, but it's more infuriating being trapped in a bracket where every game is against 3 of the same recov meme build.

No it isn't, and it hasn't been for a while. Its main advantage was infinite ammo, and they took that away. Before Luna/Rally nerf, GLs beat them out in DPS, and they still do in the first mag, and Izanagi too.

Also, have you seen the ridiculousness of the clip on my page?

I can never seem to get myself to keep the trigger down between kills. Just out if habit. So while Huck is definitely a great gun, I never seem to use it to it's potential.

Nova Warp is fine now.  It was bugged when Forsaken released.  That's why it felt so nutty because you were often hitting through walls.  Now the wall clipping is fixed, the range is tuned back a bit and it's got a little more mobility.  It think Fission and all Voidwalker paths should have a QoL change to give them the Martyrdom effect where if you have a grenade charged to go off or your Nova Warp charged you should release it on death.  So many times I've been team shot in Nova Warp but if I had just released it a frame or two sooner I would have gotten a triple kill and probably still lived.  At least I would get the triple with martyrdom.
---
Damn a lot of these are still solid options, just not dummy broken

One thing i dont understand about the destiny community is, the general amount of salt surrounding nerfs and reworks.

Ether, gout, Allan.

It's also missing Lunas. I still wear them, but they'll never be as good.

They are in the latest TWAB.  Go to [bungie.net](https://bungie.net) and click on the article that has a picture of a physically broken OEM

OEM gets to go to nerf hell not nerf heaven. I like this picture because of that.
---
Sorry, I didn't explain myself correctly here. I meant full Fireteams of high level players with meta weapons that come to classic mix just to boost their kd by killing noobs.
---
thats dumb though IMO it was a great Mob/Boss Damage option before basically giving you more flexible use than Golden Gun but Golden Gun being the better boss damage option but bad for clearing.
---
And now Golden Gun is just strictly better than it.
---
Replace it‚Äôs picture with Ursa Furiosas
---
Recluse is just one example in this list but it also stand out due to previous sand box changes to other weapons driven mostly by PVP.
---
They could also have designed Crucible focused pinnacle weapons by balancing them separately instead of creating the monster PVE combo from MT and Recluse.
---
It‚Äôs just one long list of cascading changes that trickle down. 
---
I completely agree they should nerf Recluse for real but the weapon is a symptom of the greater problem.

It's funny because most of these are still great

I get that but it still seems very inconsitent and there is video footage showing that. 
---
People just hitting the same group of enemies numerous times with Blade Barrage and seemingly getting random amounts of Super back.
---
I don't mind a new direction but at least make it more consistent.
---
I dont care if I get like 40-80% of Super back or so as long as its like 50-60% on average. But right now the difference is just so random it seems.
---
I'll run it this week and try it exclusively on tough targets/bosses and see how it does but I think its really inconsistent even then.

yeah it was *absolutely* a problem. it was the defacto "just a given" choice for high level activities strong enough that reckoning needed to be designed around it entirely. it had the same place as well-locks. the orpheus nerf+pathfinder buffs have made other things more viable thankfully. and i'm happy there's more useful exotic variety now that it's a bit closer to center. assassin's cowl is underrated for high tier pve since it just turns every enemy into a pause button/healthpack with barely any prep.

---
It can one shot in a variety of ways, and the super itself is a shutdown super so it'll kill you out of your own. Melee is faster than super, and you're glowing blue with electricity all around you in the super. Easiest way to tell them apart, aside from the fact that you can move around in the super till you land. If you're high enough up you can combine the melee with the super and basically fly around the map.

I just completed my first run through of it now, having no idea it existed. It's the first time I've loaded into the regular strike playlist since the launch of Shadowkeep. (Now that we have The Ordeal with matchmaking Nightfalls, those are the only strikes I've been playing. I've always been a solo player unable to get a fire team together to complete Nightfall strikes, so it's been a while since I've played a regular one).

Very lucky the first regular strike that I loaded onto happened to be the new one, or who knows how long I would have gone still not knowing it existed.

Sunshot seems pretty terrible nowadays-the Ace may not chain dragonfly but is otherwise better in every way. Thorn can also mow through reds without losing ammo.

Crimson is useful for getting HC precision kills in crucible as the timing for a pulse is a lot more forgiving.

TLW is incredibly fun and useful in Crucible, still entertaining in PVE (albeit not particularly useful).

Don‚Äôt have Malfeasance or Lumina, but neither is high on my list of exotic quests I‚Äôm working through-they just seem a bit fussy functionally compared to the others.

I've often wondered what it would be like if Bungie put out "go fund me" features instead of eververse. Like instead of buying cosmetics, you just buy silver to pledge to different options for things you want to see. 
---
Instead of just buying and hoping your money goes to something you'd want, you can actually have some choice. Also serves as a way to poll the community on what they want to see, instead of just relying on "Bungie knows best."

Probably wouldnt make sense in reality, but it sounds good in theory.

How slowly they turn, nothing bad really, I just miss playing on PS3

I've done 1 raid in D2 , got 1k voices and never use it. It seemed like a cool gun but doesn't do it for me personally.

It was either use nighthawk or rigs, usually one of each.

trackless waste maybe? but that might be a different one
---
Both seem to give me mine back a good amount, why?

Who the fuck are you to tell somebody they should let play the game? It‚Äôs none of your business how people spend their money or what they do with a game they purchased. I don‚Äôt support boosting but whatever, to each their own, we‚Äôre in no position to tell strangers what to do in their life..
---
Aggressive frames are very unforgiving for missed. You have to be really accurate to get the most out of them.
---
So it‚Äôs not good anymore? Idk it just used to do lots of dmg and now it doesn‚Äôt seem as much. Could be just me
---
I'm so glad I grinded for it, so Bungie and crucibabies could ruin it.
---
It's when the Undying Mind is coming to the Black Garden
---
What I would like is for them to add an option to have matchmaking in all group content, including raids and master difficulties.  I think they should still have the option to run it without matchmaking, for all of the issues that can come from having a big group of randos.  I also think we should be able to go into any content we want solo if we so choose.  I'd love to be able to go into strikes by myself and just take my time and not have to worry about anyone else being put out by me chasing butterflies, or wanting to kill everything that moves in the strike.
---
I mean, seems pretty normal to me to have a few rewards for climbing ranks, just like there are rewards for everything else. 
---
It‚Äôs not like you need those guns. Other options are very viable. And again, it was already achievable by most people to get to fabled and now it‚Äôs easier than ever. I‚Äôm sure you can do it, you just need some self confidence

Again, if they shot those at a giant boss they would get a lot back. When shooting it at a much of ads the splash damage kills them more than the knife hits, so you don‚Äôt get a lot back.

I mean, I think it‚Äôs dumb because you would ideally want to shoot it at a bunch of ads or whatever over a giant boss.

---
Funny. Never played Sparrow racing but I watched some video about playing it in 2019 yesterday and now I see it here too
---
Momentum. üòí
---
You just exposed yourself for never having heard that drifter voice line
---
its the first time that actually happened to me
---
The hardest part is the massacre medals.
---
You just use the consumable that Eva sells and then just ADS during literally any activity until it shows up
---
Nice play!  Whats the shader on your Hammerhead?
---
nah that's the kinetic one and its red. I think its bad reputation
---
Is golden guns with crits but now nighthawk better than the blade barrage in terms of damage? Cause I‚Äôd imagine so, making it still better
---
Whether we want. Why.
---
Yup
---
Yeah ik. I‚Äôve been doing that but it just won‚Äôt show up.
---
I got one-dance-free, guess I'm a stripper now.
---
Stepped into war
---
so just because you havnt bought any dlc you think the vast majority of us that have are never allowed to have any of the dlc nightfalls and therefore never get any of the Nightfall loot from them?  With this one specifically dropping one of the best shotguns in the game?
---
Play legacy then.
---
They accommodate the free players well enough. If they start leaving stuff out that requires shadowkeep, well then what's the reason shadowkeep owners have it?
---
Bro, not bragging but I'm 5 weeks in and I'm at 500h. Pump those up !
---
Snipers are different, since you 1 hit with headshots on every one. Faster RoF snipers generally have lower zoom scopes and more AA. That combined with their ease of use make them the choice for snipers over high impact.
---
Everyones saying "Its not over until I sing... and I never sing" is their favorite buttI think I like 
---
"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!"

*mounts sparrow and boosts into a bottomless abyss*
---
yOu jUsT sUcK wItH it. Look at the most used subclasses and come back and tell me how good nova warp is. Sorry that we aren‚Äôt gods at this game like you are. You probably think that oem and bts pre nerf were balanced as well right?
---
well, share clearly straps it on his leg.  a Titan of true class
---
I like the outlaw rampage combo of the coup. Spare rations is probably better for pvp though
---
I disagree, people didn't get excluded from raids for not having black hammer. Sure infinite ammo was nice, but wasn't viable for dps and was very situational to proc in most situations. Gjallarhorn had utility and the highest dps in the game.
---
*whispers* two for one.
---
YOU LOOKED DEATH IN HIS BEADY EYES AND YOU SPAT IN THEM. YOU FIEND

Tickle-Fangers.
---
Really wish they'd rework the knock back in this game....
---
Does it say anywhere that its supposed to be helpful?
---
THOSE REDJACKS COULD LEARN A THING FROM YOU GUARDIAN!
---
heh, the first time I ran into them, they became the unwilling recipients of the most successful "oh shit what the hell was that" panic ult I've ever tossed on my warlock.  They spawned right on my head as I was in the middle of fighting something.
---
I'm sitting at rank 46 on my season pass with about 20 days left, any hope I'll get the ornaments? lol
---
Lol nice
---
stop crying
---
No matchmaking, and yes you do still get rewards. The smart answer though is to find one of the LFG discord and join a fireteam speedrunning them, and clear 5+ in an hour
---
715hrs on D2 since launch... damn I'm such a causal (truly!).
---
You can just tap it to kill guardians, you know? Holding it just increases range slightly.
---
So by posting this you‚Äôre in that 99% 
---
Where‚Äôs the helpful? ü§î
---
https://wastedondestiny.com
---
Let's see those numbers guardians!
---
If memory serves it's just Arc and Solar. Eriana's works really well for wizards, and we just have someone bringe Thunderlord or riskrunner for knights.
---
The 'helpful' is suggesting the removal of all the garbage and negative behavior on this sub.
---
Including these comments.
---
Literally nothing about that kill on the shoulder charge is attributed to what the recluse will become after nerf... you weren't procced
---
The only thing that owned that titan is your resil keeping you alive.
---
In that case you need to be literally right next to them. And you can‚Äôt run in the super, the only catch up function is the blink and that drains super hella fast.

---
I'm glad that some things like titles, emblems, and shaders retain some exclusivity for those that were willing to pay for the DLC and or the season pass.
---
I would hope though that armor and weapons that could affect the game remain available to everyone. Although the next season will likely bring armor and weapons that are comparable or arguably better, so probably doesn't matter that much anyway.
---
Ohhh. Yeah not very helpful in protecting the galaxy. But bitch on about nothing buddy.. bitch on ü§òüèª

No hand cannon will ever be meta for ad clear. There can be good ones, but toe to toe with a high octane SMG like recluse...  not in the same league.

Quick reminder that around the time of the taken king in the first game Mara Sov summoned Shaxx

for a booty call

YYYYEEEEEEEEAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaa.....
---
Binary solo!!!
---
you make a fair point i guess i forgot how a good rocket launcher feels
---
Im a rather new player and to me it seems very fair
---
0 for base game
---
30 for forsaken
---
40 i think for shadow
---
So 70 bucks for endless content with top tier graphics and barely any server issues
---
Also better optomized than many other games i played
---
The opponent has match point, MEANINGLESS
---
I play titan because I like to yolo into enemies and punch things. Which reminds me, where are my crayons!?
---
Lol like anyone is killing him when there‚Äôs no good rewards or new content for it. It‚Äôs literally a reskin and doesn‚Äôt even give a pinnacle or anything new
---
Although I agree about wanting more meaningful content here, removing everything that isn't is just childish. 
---
"Hey I don't agree with what you are saying, so you are banned".
---
I mean that's what the world is now. So I guess lets go ahead and bring that into every aspect now. We don't agree or like each other viewpoints and the opposing viewpoints are blocked or removed.
---
You killed all the other players DUH!!
---
Definitely. I had a discussion with someone that had come back for Shadowkeep and had missed a few seasons prior. They felt overwhelmed and a little discouraged/confused on where to start and what to do. Which isn't a bad thing. Between the amount of content in the first season of a major dlc drop, the armor overhaul, balancing, fixing bugs, etc... I don't mind if this isn't the 'grand finale' everyone wanted, I think the next few seasons will be a lot more manageable now that they have the foundation laid without Activision breathing down their necks. Not to mention a lot of the Vex loot is actually pretty good and the amount that you get per activity.
---
*laughs is ACD*
---
I just want a basic ass sword with no perks, terrible guard, but infinite ammo
---
That's awesome dude, obviously you're having a good time so...... hope you have an even better time ;)

... Why though?
---
If your daughter has a game she enjoys playing why are you trying to get her to play the games YOU enjoy instead?
---
Yeah, like I said, Im a bit out of the loop, so I'll probably just need some more practice, and hope to RNGesus that I get a good team
---
Lmao, I'll keep that in mind
---
Odd you're calling people idiots when you have the grammar and punctuation of a 12 year old with dyslexia.
---
thanks for the info! I actually got it dropped from a normal leviathan, from the chest after the opening capture-the-banner thing, before the first encounter.
---
Oh thanks alot!
---
Lmao, you REALLY need to work on reading comprehension....
---
The first freaking few sentences.
---
On Monday, October 7, there were a reported 2.46 million total active¬†Destiny 2¬†users for the day, with an estimated 500,000 concurrent users active across all platforms at peak hours.
---
Do you know what the difference between concurrent and unique players is?
---
If two people have izanagi and one has divinity it's easier to kill the barrier and overloads
---
It was a body, but ok.
---
Says the guy with awful grammar. Love it
---
I play titan because I saw a promo clip before the alpha and wanted to "hulk smash" some fools. With high resilience and an auto rifle in the beta, it felt like I stepped back into my Mjolnir armor and I loved it. 
---
5 years later and I'm considering a tattoo on my right arm that says "The last and surest argument"
---
Makes sense. Interesting theory.

BURN IT TITAN BURRRN IT
---
"Ew" honestly.  
---
I know it may sound like I'm overreacting, but it's not about this post, it's about the mindset of certain rules.
---
\_  
---
This wasn't a "is this good or not" post, and this wasn't a "hey look what I got" post.
---
It was about the frustration of doing weekly bounties from Dreaming City after waiting one whole week. I could have presented this topic in many different ways but I chose to show a pic of the rewards since it works as a proof of the frustration instead of possibly sounding like exaggeration.  
---

---
Here is an example, let's imagine what's the next step in the holy cleansing of this subreddit, how about taking down gameplay posts? because it's way too easy to record a good play and post it.  
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/aievkh/when\_a\_meme\_build\_is\_viable/](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/aievkh/when_a_meme_build_is_viable/)   
---
Then that \^ would have been taken down, even tho it's a creative post about an unusual build that I have never seen anywhere else. It would have been taken down before even having a chance to prove itself as "not just a gameplay post", and after all, it's still just gameplay isn't it? Isn't it?  
---
Way too imaginary of an example to count right? Then check this out, this one is real, happened months ago in the apex\_legends subreddit, they were against meme formats, for being "quick to produce and brainless", literally, it was in the rules that posts need to be able to start good conversations, like it's impossible to do it via memes, and honestly, if someone really thinks that I can only feel bad for their narrow mind.
---
\-
---
Rules can't be black and white like that, this post is kind of whatever anyway, but the situation makes me feel bad for people that try to make something are are met with automatic removal that didn't take the time to even truly understand the post.
---
Guess it must be pretty *rare* then huh?
---
The chunks rotate in an orbit.

"Who says warlock are better with books than with guns?... Ok... It was me...but I was lying..."

No it no longer works

Hay guys any one know what‚Äôs going on with some kinetic sniper rifles crucible the reload is a little buggy
---
I am super unlucky, I ran the heoric mars adventure 10 times a day from last reset until yesterday. NO DROPS!!
---
 Skele-ghaul is pretty close as well on a lot of things.
---
I'd like to be able to do normal combos and guarding without ammo, but just weaker.  Doesn't make sense I forget how to swing once the battery is dead.  As a warframe addict it's actually infuriating not having a reliable cutting weapon
---
OD increases damage of Tether.

See, not many people want to play Warlock much, so they gave them fun-to-use abilities...

Punch Through That
---
I only started playing this past June, there's quite a lot I didn't see as I was warming up to the game, especially here in Reddit. It strikes me that people come out of the woodwork cause they saw something 10 months ago (the link), and presume that us newer players scour through years of Reddit posts to ensure that we don't somehow mention something that was already said in the past.
---
I don't mean to take this out on you, as you were quite reasonable in asking. It's just something I have seen in /r/raidsecrets, /r/DestinyTheGame, and even here at times. With all of the New Light players now, we should celebrate finding old information (especially if it's relevant) and bringing these tips and tricks to a new audience. Thank you, and I do appreciate your asking. :)
---
I did it three times for the title
---
Nokris is one of Oryx‚Äôs children!?!
---
Oh my lord that‚Äôs disappointing
---
I know you weren't giving me shit, sorry if it seemed like I took it that way. but yeah I agree, with the constant slew of people with truth and getting so close to killing our primeval only to get denied at the last minute kinda gets a bit old after a while.
---
gotcha
---
I tried the solo playlist and as much fun as it was getting trashed by three stacks, I‚Äôd still take that over the solo playlist. Out of my 13 games, 7 were in the regular, and 6 were in solo . 3/7 and then 0/6 in solo
---
They're all pretty decent.
---
And you can earn/find every exotic in the game, some are time gated or locked behind certain DLCs, but you can access them all if you have the full game and some rng/patience.
---
My question is why would you infuse anything into your mask?
---
My son started playing when D2 first came out. He just got his recluse and mountaintop.. and he's 10. I'm scared to private match him anymore!
---
God damn it was coming here for that line. 12 minutes late
---
&gt; Well, no, you are meaning subjectively,
---
I'm not. Seeing that strafing without changing height doesn't really give you any benefit over simply going higher and adjusting the landing spot. On top of hunter also being able to take advantage over wall-gliding, just like titan..
---
&gt; I get that you prefer the hunters jump, but you are mixing up your personal opinion with it being a fact.
---
I don't "prefer" hunter jumps, i'm just used to it mostly; like i said, if i need to skip larger gaps titan beats both warlock and hunter anyway. This is entirely objective and based on the possible amount of maneuvers. In fact, your explanation shows yet another flaw when it comes to warlock; time. Both hunter and titan can delay jumps to stay in air longer, but they aren't forced to; warlock can't simply "glide faster" beside dropping out of the air and is by far the easiest target.
---
I‚Äôd watch a slice of life show featuring Shaxx at home doing normal things.
---
It's called a feature
---
"There are no accidents" -Master Ugway
---
I mean the posts are kind of getting old but those things are  B U S T E D
---
Seriously? News to me then, I apologize
---
I feel like it‚Äôd be more a sitcom, where he‚Äôs just a stereotypical clumsy titan.
---
The amount of effort required for the base gun, not to mention the master worked version, it should definitely be better.
---
Making mistakes is acceptable. Making the same mistake for over an hour is less so
---
My favorite line is this one lol LIKE YEAH MAN!!! YOU SAW THAT SHIT!! FUCKIN WILD!!!!!!
---
You can do the 980 NF with nothing more than 2 titans with a strength build and peregrine greaves to down champions and melt the boss I did it at under 970 peregrine greaves count as knockback dmg which is why they're so good in this nightfall, tempest strike from middle tree and unstoppable melee then super and ogres melt and middle tree arc lock should bang the ogres out also
---
And no tracking grenade launchers would be a nice touch
---
Indeed that is irritating and irresponsible
---
Yeah I went into the other area, no tree lol
---
Loud Lullaby is also large. Much bigger than Better Devils.
---
Well I think that would be sort of busted for pvp, it would be very cool for pve
---
Nope!! I noticed that only after posting lol
---
THOSE KINDS OF ARTIFACTS ARE WHAT THEY NEED TO BRING IN D2!!
---
Lmao I have no friends either
---
GO! MAKE THEM CRY!
---
I see free. Am I doing this right then?
---
Here we go again
---
Wat
---
That‚Äôs a lot bigger than this https://www.sportsmansoutdoorsuperstore.com/products2.cfm/ID/173838/wh4050ds/chiappa-white-rhino-50ds-40sw-revolver-with-5-inch-barrel-and-brushed-nickel-finish
---
No need to apologize. Just letting you know friend
---
Definitely meant something for those iron banner grenade kills
---
r/Shaxx
---
And I have found that while score ups your chances most of the nightfall exclusives I received from speed runs with low  scores
---
Yea I have had a few bad experiences with that one. Almost always something like:
---
"I am really glad you guys are down there throwing batteries up here, but it would be great if one of you could come up. It is kind of hard to throw the batteries at the forge WHEN EVERYTHING IS LASER-FUCKING ME TO DEATH! I am a high mobility hunter, I don't tank. I can clear adds and throw a few, I can throw like a boss if you clear adds, but I can't do both!"   
---
If I go down on the platforms I make a point of watching the clock, and if we hit 30 seconds left and no one is throwing I head back up and toss.
---
Okay boomer
---
Nice
---
‚ÄúEp 7: Shaxx burns dinner, again.‚Äù
---
SEVENTH COLUMN especially in destiny 1
---
thanks, I was having the same issue and just assumed it was still down. confirmed logging out and back in fixes it
---
haha well I got the rare bounty yesterday, however it's the one where you need all the black armory armor and weapons equip and # of kills while it's all equipped. I thought cool good thing I've kept all the armor... went to vault, missing mark and greaves! damn it now I'm farming ignitions and frames with the shame armor I already have dropping.. so it's not just frustrating trying to GET the bounty, completing this one is a PITA!! lol. goodluck though man!

I‚Äôve reset my valor rank 2 times this season, but comp? I‚Äôm not touching comp again for the rest of this season.
---
The beginner guide on this sub also the hundreds of hours of YouTube videos, I won‚Äôt recommend any Incase you have a rubber you don‚Äôt particularly like.
---
I mean, have you enjoyed Season of the Undying?
---
I use a Logitech g903 which has two additional buttons on the side, and an infinite scroll wheel that also acts as 3 additional possible button: one when pressed down in the center, and another when the wheel is pushed both to the left and the right.     
---
I have my sprint mapped to the top button on side of mouse, melee to the button below that. Reload to scroll wheel right, grenade to scroll  wheel left. It helps to separate the shooting keys from the movement keys across mouse and keyboard.
---
Yea exactly I‚Äôm on 3 times reset lol, played an absolutely ridiculous amount of IB when it was out
---
I'm 17.
---
What is a triple noob toob? Fighting Lion?

If your power level is beyond 950 without the artifact, then they should (I do still get blues at 949 occasionally)

What the fuck did I just see lmfao
---
[removed]
---
AMAZING!!!
---
Honestly I need friends like these. I have not once ever even stepped foot on the raids since the release because 1 I didn‚Äôt have any exotics nor any weapons to even go into it. 2 I tried going into clans but not 1!!! Has ever even tried to fire team with me even if I send them invites. 3 I don‚Äôt even know what good roles are for weapons or even how to utilize the mod system or have stats from the armor to help me progress. The apps don‚Äôt work either sigh...bruh
---
Yea, remember the prismatic facet?
---
Found the Titan running Recluse and OEM
---
I feel bad man i got it on my second bounty, then again i have run five 920 ordeals in a row killing all the champions without getting atleast a prism :/ RNG in this game is broken
---
Yes I second that
---
Don't forget the strike that comes after, you have to complete it flawlessly (dying kicks you back into orbit) very, very fun to do solo.
---
Have you seen the two giant skulls that hang above Shaxx?
---
obviously skins/shaders whatever cost waaaay to much for bungie to develop by letting us have  something we like so we would not have to pay for something in eververse
---
Yeah, it rotates. Momentum was there for a couple of weeks.
---
damn I need a link for that considering I can‚Äôt find it on YouTube
---
Thank you. I‚Äôll admit I‚Äôm kinda salty that warlocks have been pushed aside for so long but this seems like an easy fix they‚Äôve been ignoring because everyone mains hunter or titan
---
Well now you cant play PvP anymore :D
---
√ßasusl
---
Nice.
---
Nothing is an easy fix for Bungie. After all, a nerf to One Eyed Mask took them a year and a half lol
---

makes me sad... but it is worth it

---
I have an immediate disdain for anyone that uses wardcliff in pvp. I guess my anger comes from the weapon itself though. I will be ten miles away and one of the rockets hits my pinky toe and I explode into atoms. I use the weapon and fire it directly into a crowd of enemy players and it just takes off their shields and I die for some reason.
---
Ah, okay. I have that one also. Guess I got them confused.

As a Semi-Casual gamer I've been OK with hte Content thus far. In fact I'm only level 53 so I still have a ton more to do IMO&gt;
---
Yeah I don't know about pvp but for pve that roll is amazing.
---
Yeah I do one my mates gave me an extra for some reason
---
Do you I have to do anything to like get the quest
---
It‚Äôs always worth a look to see if the event is going to start. When you transmat in and EP is running then go back and forth between the zones until you get into a lobby without it active.
---
Spectral blades is great in crucible with the new exotic helmet
---
Honestly you should get it just because the zero hour mission is really fun. But the gun itself is good, not a top tier endgame option, but good in general play.
---
u/LUDERSTN destiny memes er de bedste
---
Hell yea! Especially if u got a team using it with u, AND the catalyst (not required but it performs better, does more damage with the catalyst, and more nanites) then yes, it's great all around, cuz u can sit in the back and easily take out majors or bosses from a distance, but yea over all, 10/10, I got it when it first came out and it's always been on all 3 of my characters ever since, plus I mean if u got a team using it with u? Shit yall will be pumping out some big PP damage bro,
---
Same problem, gives me the "too many friends" error sometimes... and I have a grand total of like 5 friends on my list. crucible, vanguard strikes, and most planetary stuff is fine, but the moon dies anytime i go there
