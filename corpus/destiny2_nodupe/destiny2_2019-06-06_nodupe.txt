I much prefer the single quest with many requirements
---
---
---
It doesnt ban you unless you back out three games in a short amount of time.
---
There is no oof big enough to describe how I feel for math class.
---
bungie needs to see this. last night it took me awhile to find and get used to the new ugly ui
---
Lol you're all wrong! Will post an update...
---
The new pursuits tab has got way too much text that it is quite the eyesore. It also makes it difficult to find which bounties are completed because it just looks so cluttered. Also completing a bounty should shift the bounty below up, instead of the one on the right. Also bounties should be grouped together by type, not by order they've been obtained, because sometimes the weekly bounties are separated too far from the dailies, so you could have your weekly and daily Gambit prime and black armory bounties together and then the following day, all the dailies all shift to the end which is now a new page in most cases so trying to see where you're at with say "complete 7 BA daily bounties" just makes you go back and forth a lot
---
Momnigul!
---
Take my upvote
---
I personally enjoyed step by step for Luna's. While it did take a while to get and could be tedious at times, it was more fun and I could focus on one thing at once instead of trying to get multiple different steps done at one time. Even though it only took me around 2.5-3 days to get, it was something for me to do since the end of the season was sort of dry for me and the step by step quest gave me a real challenge while with cluster quests you just get those done over time unless you really want to grind it out quickly.
---
I do like the look of this but at the same time I do like having Pursuits right next to the Map, it makes it easier to swap between the 2 without having a ton of tabs in the options menu (I'm on PS4)
---
Pretty annoying I paid for that utter trash and now it’s free.
---
They look like they deepfried the old shader icons, but I'll get used to it.
---
Yes. I hate it.
---
That's me regularly playing sniper, and I love it. I'm comfortable enough with my dick size so k/d doesn't matter.
---
Everything
---
I'm getting excited and I've always played on pc lmao.
---
The old bitch of cuba is getting a foot up her ass come september.
---
Pretty sure they did it with gambit prime as well
---
majority of those people sniping are probably bad anyways not to be rude
---
You’re supposed to gather a fire team for it, they’re not meant to be done solo
---
There’s no matchmaking for nightfalls. It’s the way it’s always been. Get a fire team together.
---
How?
---
I really like this, although I don't think the Pinnacle Weapon and Synthesizer tabs need to be that big, there could be more space for things like the Quest and Exotic tabs rather than them being 1 row with a button to switch pages. Maybe a system similar to the Collections page would work, although that doesn't mean I don't like this idea
---
How do I do that
---
Cross save wavesplitter onto xbox
---
Stop replying to yourself.
---
Uhhh make friends? Join LFG discords? There’s a destiny Sherpa subreddit that I’ve met some people to do raids with.
---
You can either go to r/fireteams
---
Or use the destiny 2 companion app for the LFG
---
Or do a shadow clone jutsu.
---
The Bungie Companion App, and also /r/Fireteams.
---
yes &amp; no
---

---
It's just not respectable to hit a body shot, I don't think "wow, impeccable shot". Honestly I'll look for the icon sometimes just to make me feel better that they're either actually decent enough to hit a face, so it's a "worthy opponent", or that they resort to cheap stuff to kill me. Either way I kinda win while still being dead, at least I'll feel a little better
---
on the other hand, that's what I think. Meanwhile I'm sniping bodies left &amp; right because who cares? Me, apparently.. but I shouldn't. it's not OP or anything. I got 2 sniper scavenger perks, had 10 ammo, still got killed by the 2nd person that attacked me
---
Not telling you what to do but fireteams take away from the “story” of story missions, I suggest just doing a few public events or crucible or gambit to jump your light level up and you’ll be able to breeze through it all with no problem
---
Honestly, being someone who plays mostly pvp, i really like the crucible right now. im on console and am used to most people using LH and DRB, so having most games filled with snipers is a really welcome change
---
\*2st
---
can't be that hard, I must be up to, oh, at least 20 completions since black armory came out...
---
not only that, but ive never seen some of the perks on the new guns
---
r/FeelsBadMan This happened to two of our raid team. We were ready in orbit 15 mins before the raid dropped. Soon as it launched two of us disconnected. 
---
One was out for an hour and the other about 8. Needless to say the hype was killed and it slowly spiralled downwards.
---
Thanks, didn't know these things existed! I was wondering how I could find people for the raid as well.
---
Thanks!
---
just a trickster bomb, dont fall for it
---
No problem, Raid would be the same way
---
There's a triumph for invading with 15 motes
---
Forsaken is $40 not 60
---
Really? Even for the ones that happened before I started playing?
---
Oh ok. My bad on that. So is the annual pass worth the purchase? I keep hearing it's not but not sure if just haters or good feedback
---
My issue is that I decide each season to pick it up with like 2 weeks left to get 4 resets. Hasn’t worked yet.
---
Yes they are for the flawless
---
Wait a minute I'm in this screenshot.... hmmmmmm..... Can't believe I've just now seen this after all this time lmao.
---
Yes, I'm not 100% certain but am pretty sure you should be able to
---
I'm trying to get my first reset done this week. Since it's only day 2 of the season and I'm at mythic 1 I think I'm doing alright.
---
I'm not sure where you're hearing its not or what you're hearing, but 1) you need Forsaken to get the annual pass and 2) at this point there is an incredibly significant amount of content that it has added over the past 6 months for only the amount that it is, so I would say yes, especially if you want to continue to play more of the current content.
---
My problem also is why I don’t have mountain top, recluse, or lunas.
---
I don’t like crucible. At first, it’s fine. But by the third reset I wanna bash my head in.
---
I Hate to say it. But... *Than
---
I hate how I just found this out now. I did quickplay first and it was hell.
---
restart your game or load the tower fresh
---
I'm assuming mayhem is good for imperials as well?
---
It should also work with other hologram emotes like the table, flip coin, swing emote so u can have a meeting with yourself
---
just grind it out
---
I'm not amazing at crucible but I tried going after the Gambit bow part of yesterday and for some reason I barely get any medals. So that's when I decided I'd go into mayhem and just try to grind it out.
---
Awesome, I'll check that out. Thank you!
---
I’m actually surprised they didn’t nerf recluse so this would be more popular
---
never
---
Arbalest risk runner/recluse any fast fire rate heavy
---
To the 57 people who disliked: Why are you gay?
---
you're welcome
---
I only did 2 chars, with not all rewards on both, and got to 618 (had bad rng too). It was difficult because they locked it so whatever your light, you’d always be underleveled by at least 15
---
I do the vanguard pinnacles, and I really do try with the crucible ones. But after I start wishing I was doing something else, I stop. It’s a game, meant to be fun. Not annoying.
---
How the hell is this shit “spamming”?!
---
Spam encompasses many types of posts, read the description. Low effort, doesn't encourage discussion.
---
Daddy
---
I read this too!!! I really hope it all works out. I've built a gaming pc and have been wanting to play destiny 2 on it but i have so many hours invested in D2 on ps4 not to mention money as i bought it when it first released and when the forsaken dlc came out. I just can't put all that time or money to do it all over again. Lol
---
Care to try again?
---
Look up Th3Jez he refers to datto as daddy
---
\*invades with 20\*
---
You say that this doesn’t encourage discussion in the community however in YOUR rule book it doesn’t say that
---
In fact this isn’t spamming at all this is the first post of it so in no way is this spamming
---
All moderators can remove posts that violate the rules at their own discretion. This falls under a type of spam that does not at all encourage discussion, I'm not debating this anymore, and I don't suggest you do either.
---
I saw these indestructible crystals all over the strike, and I have no clue why. Does anyone know?
---
Still worked for me last week.
---
Datto, the true champ who powered through sickness just to try and get first, he deserves that exotic
---
I'm friggin loving it. No shotgun apes in sight
---
Not worth it until you are lvl 50 (assuming you have forsaken) and done the new Season introductory quest
---
When you hover over the daily heroic story missions, it should say "challenge: do heroic story missions 0/3." This is supposed to tell you that you are supposed to do 3 heroic story missions. The ones you can see are the available story missions to choose from. Pick any three that you want to do. Most people just pick the fastest one, or their favourite one, and do that one three times. 
---
Challenges like that are the only way to get gear that increases your power level past a certain point, so yes, it's worth it to do them.
---
Fuck you calus, you think a team of 6 gaurdians that are light level 710 or below can beat a horde of level 720 -740 ads and powerful enimies!? Go jump off of... Something!!!
---
Had some pretty insane luck the past 2 days, 2 curated snipers (twilight and tartara) and the bee hunter exotic arms yesterday and then 3x 1kv's, jotunn and the curated kindled orchid today. Most of it was all dupes but still. Been a lucky few days :)
---
You finished the quest, haha!
---
So wait that's it? That's all of it?
---
how good is that content ? like i got the base game back last year during the blizz promo thing, how much content am i looking at before having to buy forsaken ?
---
This is my whole-ass point. We got two, they're both badass and memorable (unlike last season's unless you like it). People are thinking I don't know we get them every season. I mean, I am wayy too sarcastic. P R E T T Y  shaders.
---
Warlocks are my favorite class to play, but I hate the way they look. Titans are badass looking, but I dont like playing them. This is a dilemma I run into a lot in games and it sucks lol.
---
We did it boys, *Fortnite* is no more
---
did you put an armour gem into your chalice?
---
Put a cloak but for a exodus one
---
Dread it, run from it, Destiny arrives all the same.
---
That's the end of the quest, yes. Now you just do stuff and the new Menagerie related things (imperials, runes?) drop, but I don't really understand how that all works yet.
---
what do you mean?
---
Delete this
---
Exodus black armor
---
The quest will give you 690 gear across all characters. But you have to be at level 50 to equip that gear, and you also have to complete the campaigns to play annual pass content. The character boost should make having multiple characters easier, unless you’ve already used it.
---
Where is that?? I can't find it
---
I’ll just check light.gg real quick...
---
I used fighting lion and edge transit because for this week its void singe (it really doesn't matter i think) but bring friends with u for efficient progress
---
Do you know the recipe for the new quickfang?
---
Why do you need one later? I might have used em all.... (But im finished with the invitations questline)
---
Couldn’t have happened to a nicer bloke really.
---
I beg your fucking pardon?
---
I don't have any SOO triumps completed other than the one for completing the managerie. I fucking hate this game sometimes.
---
Triumphs&gt;Destinations &gt;Minor &gt; Menagerie
---
My low point is the movements of pursuits, I don't know why it's bugging me so much... Actually, does anyone know how to lock in preference of order?
---
Thank you, how am I supposed to know to do that bungie ffs
---
[Opulence](https://youtu.be/aShxnRwR7h4)
---
you would still need to buy it again on pc even with cross save
---
Fuck yes
---
Imagine rolling up to gambit, cloning yourself, then fistbumping.
---
No. You are just forever engraved in the hall of fame i guess.
---
Everyone who completes it under 24h gets ~$500 jackets and an emblem i guess.
---
Also the lore
---
I didn't realize its head was cut off and now I am sad. Thanks. :(
---
Embrace the chaos and just try stuff
---
oh i see it's an account base quest rightio ty
---
Completely
---
Yeah, just start poking around, pick something that sounds fun and follow it until you wanna try something else
---
Idk why this looks like a [ganbreeder](https://ganbreeder.app/category/random) pic...
---
By the power of Reddit invested in us, you will be pronounced dead if you don’t Sony
---
One of these days we'll go to Uranus
---
I saw this yesterday and when I went to sleep I actually dreamed that this was in the game. It was nice
---
sorry. im so sorry
---
wow, that was a lot of negativity out of nowhere
---
Best thing is when you both have the mirror mirror thing, it's one big group hug!
---
Well this was fun to read. Sure im the snowflake here i was the one getting but hurt for a bit of a troll. Damn you are talking about yourself right? Again you took that twelve yearold comment out of context. I asked and i even said you can spell better then me. Good one there. Repeting my own words. 
---
I saw on your profile you main raider. I just wanted to confirme like you did with that i have never been on desteny 2. Didnt know you could see the games i play on my reddit acount that isnt hooked up to naything else.
---
Yeah im not 100% serious here. The things you call me out for. Is things i make joke about now. Im making fun of you with those comments like the right opinion. I know what a opinion is. I am mimicin your actions.
---
Yeah i am good enougth to be understod... You spell better then me. But your brain dont seem to work when its comes to reading or understanding the point of words... 
---
Yeah i am not that good at english. I toucht myself so my grammer isnt perfect but the simplest of people can understand what i am saying. So let me say this slow.
---
The gun is not broken git gud...
---
I don't get how fortnite is so popular for streaming. I was only able to get through one video, watching a second one made me realize it's just so damn boring to watch.
---
This is beautiful
---
And you'll get shadowbanned by the mods soon topkek
---
Mr. Stark, we won
---
I picked up oxygen and it was still 700 at the start. How?
---
Changed the way the icon looks.
---
That’s all, as far as I’m aware.
---
Huh? You thought it was just a giant head?
---
Sweet
---
Thanks
---
It's available. Run it! :)
---
This. I was expecting something like this. Oh boy i was wrong.
---
Big up for this!
---
I just reeeeaaaally hope for Bungie's sake, the new dlc arrives in October, and not September....cause if it arrives the week of Borderlands 3, I honestly don't know how it's gonna fare :(
---
Bungie hear us!
---
It's like Whisper. Not going away. Good luck!
---
He can do that forever you know . When you respawn at the other side of the map , there he is again .
---
Well the 705 heat that ikora gave me didn’t raise my LL, so idk how it happened, maybe I was unlucky
---
Perhaps
---
Yea that’s the best bet
---
Here's a tip, put on some headphones, if you're old enough, grab some goodies, and just start at the beginning. Experience it all the way through.
---
Sorry for quality , I’m really pissed off about this
---
I first tried to kill them with the wishender idk why
---
Report them, they will do something about it.
---
RIP me and datto
---
i have ace, chaperone, thorn and tlw available on alts...
---
*Shax hands you adoption papers*
---
If I were bungie I’d send you a BIIIIG Care Package for this concept, a statue of Cayde-6, a Thorn T-Shirt, and a steelbook and a poster
---
If the other guys don’t want the code, I’d be happy to take it. Congrats on the clear!
---
1st thing I did before anything was pick up my loaded question and was a 704 drop when I was all still 700
---
double check the perks, if it has High-Impact Reserves; that’s just the audio cue for the perk
---
which part of it is confusing?
---
If only! that would be so nice...
---
Step 1) Touch giant, phallic Rasputin tower
---
Step 2) kill everything
---
Step 3) profit
---
No! It's a calus thing. I got a triumph for killing enemies in strikes with calus themed gear and got an Ikora Tribute.
---
Yeah all about laying down a couple from Anarchy then swapping weapons, your anarchy nades will continue to shock them while your firing another weapon
---
are you using any auto-loading holster weapons?
---
He didn't build it, he just reposted it.
---
Well considering I stated the menagerie looks awesome I'm not sure what to say about that.  The fact of the matter is it was still a pretty big part of the end game chase for me regardless, you can tell others are none too excited about the change.
---
If you wait and watch the bungie stream today, they should be announcing cross-save where you can take your progress to PC or Xbox from another platform. But I think you can use M&amp;K on Xbox.
---
This is my first ever post
---
You on ps4? We could try it together for the jacket thing! Might be strange after this morning but im not that kinda guy normally x)
---
We’ll cross saves are rumored to be coming so you might not loose all your progress
---
I was hella unlucky then
---
It would even still look cool if even just the cables had some purple accents.
---
There was a post pinned to this sub for returning players but I can’t find it. Maybe someone else can link it?
---
100% agree
---
Rest in peace my friend...
---
There was another video about someone saying you can collat with it, I just uploaded this to show it's not just headshots
---
Finished my Fighting Lion catalyst finally. Time to rock out for Wendigo
---
I was about to make the exact same post, the last thing I did was the last wish and I was wondering if it was worth it to jump back into it
---
Dumb question, but i did the questline (afaik) and was able to queue up and run the menagerie once. I didn't receive credit for completion despite being there from start to finish and opening the chest in the instance. But now im unable to queue into it for a second run, it just says "you are not eligible for this activity".
---
Any ideas?
---
Maybe it's time to invest in some new parts or a used PC with better parts
---
If you want to spawntrap something thats the way to go, else plant 2 shots directly on the target
---
Mountaintop just straight up does *significantly* more pve damage than comparable weapons.
---
Rat king
---
He was born to lose.
---
Sotp
---
If you are standing there you’ve already messed up. Go watch Esoterickks video on how to do it.
---
Oh ok gotcha. Nice shot!
---
I would guess that one appears at Sloane if abandoned.
---
Ahh.
---
What are “we” making right?
---
Please stop it right now, this is serious crime in bungie eyes ****NERF ALERT****
---
Sony has chosen to take their dominance of the console market and isolate themselves hoping people won't care and will continue to buy their products. I expect a mass reversal during the next console wars. Xbox will smoke them and maybe they'll learn their lesson. If not, they deserve to fail.
---
Cross save for all gamers
---
Give it a try, especially combined with mountaintop, in said combo it pretty much beats out everythinv in dps, that is not a joke, try it, see for yourself. And ofc its not only good for boss dmg, but also the best weapon to spawntrap adds in the whole game.
---
It doesn’t
---
Good song.
---
Is that the trials shader?
---
The absolute best sniper I’ve ever used in destiny across both games is the new beloved sniper, try to get one with the no distractions, box breathing and a range masterwork, people hate on box breathing for whatever reason but it shuts down any super in one precision hit 6 resilience and below from what I’ve noticed. With a targeting adjuster too it has alone as a god aim assist, with box breathing you get stickier aim assist bc more range and it does ~540 on a crit making it a super viable option for super shutdown
---
You merely adopted the smoke. I was born into it, molded by it.
---
I think other than Sony being a party pooper bungie is doing the right thing. They are making an amazing game f2p and introduced microtransactions which will bring them a ton of income without Activision breathing down their necks... I think the future of destiny looks bright, especially for me because I dont buy those microtransactions anyways
---
I hate when they fix stuff that’s not broken at all. No one asked for it either. It’s not like it’s in bungie please. Hey bungie could you please do something with the pursuits tab? I want to be confused for awhile.
---
Did you check to see if she has a second page?
---
Other places to try would be Banshee-44 or Tyra Karn.
---
I agree and if it's something I like I will happily pay the money
---
Link it up buddy.
---
Oh shit, that's smart
---
Literally every day
---
Same. It was specifically mentioned that they WOULD be powerful in several raid-prep guides I looked at.
---
I was doing 35,000 per crit on a heroic strike boss with Sturm.
---
I had mine done before season end also. My loaded question was sitting with Zavala for the last two weeks or so
---
Link?
---
I left one auto rifle kill on my breakneck and claimed it later just in case
---
Yes i did lol
---
Where and how to pre order 👀👀👀
---
Ok, just checking.
---
*begins tossing throwing knives and nades at the sun*
---
What was up with the destiny 1 thing in the video doc?
---
Absolutely, but I would try and wait until it comes out on Steam (not a joke, it genuinely is), unless it's next year.
---
Move from battle.net to steam.
---
Fuck yes!
---
Yeah, they did say that
---
no, just as enemies
---
They just announced today you can.
---
This most likely has to do with savathun and some story related stuff, i dont think bungo ran out of ideas yet
---
ik but I don't think having microtransactions in a paid game that can cost over $100 is okay. I blame Activision for this tho.
---
What are you talking about? Cross save was announced on stream for ALL platforms.
---
Space wizards that dont die.
---
Start playing, figure out the basics, then YouTube MyNameIsByf for the deep lore.
---
Doesn't help that its difficult to communicate in this game..  If I see someone about to mess up the Heroic event spawn there's no easy way to tell them to stop.
---
No.
---
A third time? That's an insane amount of hours. Lol no way I'll be able to invest that much time with work and being a social butterfly. Haha
---
Welcome to the menagerie!
---
But anarchy does exist.......  In the UK
---
It's already happening so.
---
Yes, that is what they said.  PC is steam and stadia.
---
I knooow. I was super psyched that he wanted to play (were in our 30's and dont get much time to game together),  but then he said hes getting it for xbox...my heart sank.
---
Cross save is coming to Xbone, PS4, PC and Stadia this Fall. No news on cross play.
---
Cross save (not cross play)
---
Honestly, rigth now its smarter to wait till september, untill the free to playish version with all alot of content. They just announced it.
---
Wrong coke...
---
They said it had something to do with psychological horror, so I'm guessing it has something to do with the story and Savathun making our guardians relive their past experiences.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Don't start complaining yet, this content sounds fantastic so far.
---
Because we can't get there.
---
Yes, I read the OP wrong
---
Did it not have a disclaimer that said approval from Sony was *pending*? Or did I miss that? I missed a huge chunk.
---
Sweet, I have time to upgrade to a nice pc to get the full experience!
---
No you have to buy the new expansion for 35 dollars
---
Its exclusive on steam got pc players. If u want to pre order on x box u can x box one that is
---
New trailer?!
---
/s ?
---
With friends it might be ok because no one is going to be a jerk and just dominate the activity because they have a better system. But overall if rather not have it.
---
Yes, this was confirmed during the livestream. You do not have to own any expansions to explore and play in the expansion areas like the Moon or the Dreaming City.
---
I don't think the comparison between the car and a video game really works.   
---
Mainly being price and what they provide.   
---
I think Destiny 2 should go free to play.
---
don’t see a reason for d3 to release. online service games like destiny do not need to have sequels.  they can just keep building on the foundation they already have which i think is the way to go.
---
I'm pumped. I hopped on board last season so Its good to know I still have time to enjoy the game
---
Except I'm not asking for a refund?
---
For reallllll
---
template's from BlueWestlo
---
 https://twitter.com/BlueWestlo/status/1136705588883263494
---
You’re so out of touch. 
---
You spent money. You got an experience for that money. You are owed nothing.
---
It is 100% common for goods to depreciate in value over time.
---
When you bought your car, did you go back to the dealer 2 years later asking for a few thousand dollars back because your car is worth less now that it’s been used for 2 years?
---
Get real.
---
 Damn that was fast
---
But you will need it for exclusive content released during season 9-11.
---
I was more curious than upset. I know other games in the past (CS:GO) had done the same. I just didn't know if bungue had said anything about it
---
I was just wondering if they were going to make it more of a persistent world, more like WoW.. which kinda lends itself to just releasing updates / expansions...   which would be awesome. It sounded to me like that was the direction they are trying to go in.
---
If it happens id doubt it would be as strong as it used to be. That or it starts strong and gets the whisper treatment.
---
That’s incorrect. They said in stream that new light players will have access to all destinations/patrols/lost sectors/public events/etc. however if you want to experience the story and raids or the destinations, you have to buy the expansions.
---
eris moooooorn
---
AND black garden raid hell yes
---
This is incorrect. Once D2:NL launches you do not have to own Forsaken or Shadowkeep to access The Moon or The Dreaming City.
---
yea and everyone feels that way (besides the PvP community)
---
No you dont you dont have to buy those to play shadowkeep and once you buy shadowkeep you get the season you bought it in for free.
---
I guess we can leave it at that then. A respectful disagreement. You still get entertainment for the money so I don’t see how it’s different but I can keep it respectful since you can. Thanks for sharing your thoughts.
---
I'd be cool with that. I'd prefer to keep building my character rather than start over, which is what would most likely happen in a new game.
---
This is seriously awesome thanks man.
---
Cross save all platforms :)
---
[BOOM](https://twitter.com/bungie/status/1136686496969134080?s=21)
---
I really enjoy the game play and there is so much to do and so many weapons at this point that I never feel bored with it.
---
Genuine question: If your internet is that slow, how do intend on playing a game that is 100% online?
---
So, I got the game on Battle.net and would love to get Shadowkeep. How do I do this?
---
Yes. Thanks man, also guessing that is coming with the September expansion
---
Also surprised about ps4 because they were the main reason it didn't happen
---
Mostly because i hate Activision's predatory practices, and as most of the guys said, all my games in one place :)
---
Its not f2p more like a stacked account some devs give to youtu ers for sponsorships. Since you start out at 750 off the bat but you dont get everything starting from forsaken and up.
---
As of right now, if you have destiny 2 you can get warming and CoO for free. No idea why.
---
Crota, Gaul and that Fallen dude.
---
Destiny 2 still has a ton of life left in it.
---
Yep console all the way
---
Are you an idiot?
---
I dont think u will be able to play on battlenet when shadowkeep arrives they said it will be on steam exclusively
---
The expansions aren't free just D2
---
I don’t want to rebuy the entire game though.
---
Nothing has been announced so far
---
Thank you for being one of the people that can express an opinion and talk about it being respectful. I appreciate you, take an updoot.
---
Callus has got some ticked up fanfic going on here
---
new Eververse looks a lot like an Activision version of it
---
No you can transfer everything on steam they announced cross play 😇
---
ERIK’S MOM IS BAAAAAAACK BBY
---
Well, I tried searching battle, so im assuming its already predownloaded and no need for activation
---
Ok, sweet
---
I pretty much agree with this. Plus if d3 does come, there’s a solid chance it’ll have a rocky start like D1 and D2 did. I’d rather not have to wait for another TTK or Forsaken type expansion to fix the game
---
The current one is done and the next one comes with shadow fall so yes
---
I just got the salt emote so that one is just a matter of knocking out whatever other shitty emotes I don't have yet.
---
im hoping maybe some new supers/subclass options  with this expansion, the new armor system sounds dope
---
We and the squad are going to run crown of sorrow blind
---
No but its obvious you are, they literally said during the QnA that shadowkeep will be standalone no requirements needed and if you buy it in whatever season you get that season for free.
---
Do you mind if I ask why?
---
Is $35 the confirmed price? I haven’t seen it anywhere
---
Will I get this with the Annual Pass?
---
But they both forgot the elusive 69
---
If anything, it’s the opposite. It sounds like she needs our help
---
Color me idiot , bought the expansions not a month ago :(
---
Faster asking here, then reading a whole bunch of things...
---
Thanks, I got really worried.
---
There is no such thing as destiny 3, the hoaxes were fake.
---
Where did you pay that much for it? Its 60 USD  for Everything but the Season Pass Forge/Drifter/Opulence, 24.99 for the season pass so all in thats 85 dollars, or 85\*.79= 67.15 €. Not sure if its exactly across like that, just odd if it weren't. 
---
Thats of course on xbox, they gave the base game away for FREE on pc already. 
---
  
---
All of destiny isn't free to play, just the base game/first 2 Y1 Expansions CoO and Warmind
---
Do people just ignore all giant news stories here and just post anyway? Literally huge announcement today that Destiny 2 is moving to Steam in September.
---
The one in the photo isn’t dusty calls. Duty calls looks very different
---
One week?
---
So ur speed it's...

---
Sad story.
---
After the second time you’ve gotta know that they’re just messing with you! This made me breath out heavily.
---
Dont preorder anything ever.
---
I got it while killing enemies in public events. It just popped up on my rewards. Looked like one of the Legendary engrams when it dropped.
---
Then you need nothing. For the first time ever, you don't need other stuff to get into Shadowkeep. If you have no interest in the Annual Pass stuff, skip it and just buy Shadowkeep. you can jump right into that without even owning Forsaken or Annual pass.
---
So just the 35$ Shadowkeep purchase is all you will need to jump in on day one.
---
Thanks a lot for the tip! I’ll wait a day or two then.
---
do i have to buy it again to have it on steam? (i have it on battle.net)
---
what about the 105 MB storage requrement.
---
Nah, I get it. Just don't think its funny. Then again, I'm an adult so maybe the younger crowd thinks its funny.
---

---
Seeing as Crota is fairly iconic he could be the final boss of it. But maybe he's just a part of it
---
I'm well aware of what a meme is. Just because its a mem doesn't automatically make it funny.
---
Ah, got it. Too lazy to do the leg work yourself.
---
It would “ruin their reputation” cuz idiots can’t accept the epic launcher for some reason. They’d get way more money for it tho which is what bungie needs rn
---
This guy gets it
---
That's a good question, I'm not really sure. I'd assume no, but you never know these days lol
---
sure thing!
---
That means nothing. There could easily be a new mode where you fight old raid bosses similar to Menagerie but it has a score attack mode.
---
Seems like a pretty big jump from nothing solid.
---
Don't do that, don't give me hope
---
Ok after watching the livestream it seems to go like this:
---
With the Launch of Shadowkeep They’re going back to traditional expansion type content.  You’ll have to buy Shadowkeep but it also serves as the next “annual pass”.
---
The minor seasonal content and changes will be part of the free to play portion with larger content drops in the form of paid expansion packs.
---
It really does look like it I think they’ll bring it back
---
Deleted faster than the reload of the mag when the OP realized I think.
---
I haven't leveled in forever so I can't speak to leveling up, but the game is still plenty active on all platforms.
---
all good, just wanted to let you know politely before someone came in and was an asshole about it and you had no idea why.
---
This isn’t canon, it’s a prediction made by Calus (who has basically gone mad)
---
Idk bout that whenever the moon is even mentioned this comic comes to mind ao most likely not stolen
---
I hope you're right I would play the game twice as much as I do already if they added it, you'd catch me in crucible 7 days a week
---
Oh yeah, it was deleted less than a minute after I posted. LOL sometimes people just need to remember to turn on their brain!
---
THIS FOR ALL THE TIMES YOU STOMPED TO WALL YOU MOTHERFU$@ER
---
"MY OWN BLOOD"
---
I believe it was in the stream where the upcoming update was revealed. There's also talk about it on this sub. I'm not quite sure if it is also available for console users but if so, then it should be in store anytime soon.
---
they dont accept it for various reasons, its shitty for the customer, in many ways, and it bribes (atleast it feels like that)... the only reason developers choose epic store is because they get offered a large sum in exchange for exclusivity... epic tries to copies sonys "only on our platform" stategy, when it coems to games and people dont like that
---
Oh, surely not a third time...
---
***BY SHAXX!!!***
---
3 fucking years lol
---
I swear, if I didn't hold back, I would have busted the fattest nut this world has seen
---
Are there going to be any special things for people who've bought everything up until now? If they're making like 75% of the game free all of a sudden. lol
---
There still isn't really much. I think some people say Merciless is OK, but with Trench Barrel and full auto, its still one of the best options.
---
Literally me. I played D2 for a bit, but gave it up before the first DLC dropped because I got to max power in like a week and it was boring after that.
---
This latest trailer gave me chills and hope.
---
They would not have been able to develope and continue the game without money to keep it going from sales of the new expansions... thats how this shit works.
---
Oh yess, I remember. It’s the one that looks like blade barrage.
---
Yea, now on second thought- probably class specific.
---
I didn’t even get that one.
---
It seems like it's a joke but it's not.
---
Yeah
---
Can I get a reference for this?
---
Thank god
---
Destiny 2 base game isnt that expensive let alone there will be a $40 for the current full dlc then shadowkeep is $35 with no requirements for purchase and the next annual pass doesnt really exist outside the deluxe version so you can buy which ever seasons you like or dont. Its the cheapest it will ever be compared to on release purchasing.
---
Link plz
---
No lie this is exactly what I jumped into clan party chat and said as soon as reveal was done.
---
Same thing with me, i just assumed its because i dont have enough imperials yet and only have 1 ruin.
---
[*Reloads fists*](https://youtu.be/yUbb5l0lYT8?t=30)
---
Moon's haunted
---
Why would I be butthurt?
---
It is bundled with the new one and each season is sold separately with zero dlc requirements for both shadowkeep and seasons.

Base game for new players is completely f2p more so that people who paid are salty.
---
They might just go the route of making the dlcs pricier and i would be okay with that.
---
700 is about where you need to be
---
Your chalice needs at least one rune in it
---
Someone blade barraged a bubble.....
---
I mean, it'll still force you to pay for most of the content. You'll have barebones access for free, but if you want any real stuff, you'll have to pay
---
Customizable gear is the ultimate finisher for me. I proposed that system a few months ago. Eververse gear will actually be relevant.
---
Looks like a Taken tree and not much else partner
---
It's the recommend minimum level, the activity is doable at thelat point but it's definitely not going to be a walk in the park. Plus the content just dropped officially on Tuesday, there are bound to be bugs, glitches, and just general weirdness. If you remember, the Volundr Forge was patched not long into the release of Black Armory. This first week is the real trial period of the activity and it will probably get a patch or the like here in the next few weeks. Just play the game and enjoy yourself and it will get better
---
They suck at everything.
---
It's a new "base game" that will include the content from Osiris, Warmind and I think Forsaken and the current annual pass for free.
---
I have rune of joy inserted , and just spend 70k to open chests from that ship
---
*super strike
---
That sucks I just bought it a few months ago.
---
Even at 700 to 710 I still feel waaay too weak.
---
*D2 PC community silently judges all others*
---
Yup, feels great to be an Xbox player.
---
Or learn to be an aggressive sniper
---
So what exactly will I have to do to play it?
---
Buy it on steam, then migrate on the 17th?  Or will preorders allow us to migrate early?
---
I'm gonna snap the bald ones neck and yell team 3 star when i do it .
---
Not sure why people are downvoting. It's a dumb choice for them to pull the DLC, I'm not going to pay $60 when I only need the one DLC.
---
lol nah BlueWestlo tweeted the template right away and I happened to have a tab of Elon Musk open. The caption practically wrote itself
---
Platform?
---
So happy I played the demo before I wasted my money.
---
I felt good at 705 until the third wave. I felt like I was getting one shot killed constantly.
---
Quick question about cross-platform: I’ve had D2 on PS4 for a while now, but I recently made the switch to PC. Can I buy destiny for free then transfer my PS4 save to PC?

NOOOOO NOT MY PS4 EXCLUSIVE ARMOUR!
---
Moon’s haunted
---
Glad to help!
---
Can you provide a link for proof?
---
You gotta upgrade the first slot of three on the bottom right
---
That or you can transfer your acc to Destiny: New Light and itll just give you all your content
---
Did OP get the grey pigeon? or did OP stop playing Destiny?
---
I had said this earlier today that I felt like it was rushed out after it was datamined and leaked on YouTube
---
Ahhh thanks, i saw them in the xol strike. They could be to tease tge upcoming expansion
---
The game is no longer gonna be on battle.net, it's being moved to steam.
---
The deluxe edition of shadowkeep is shadowkeep which is the first season, and then the annual pass for the later 3 seasons
---
*Activates Selfie Emote*
---
Steam exclusive good
---
Epic exclusive bad.
---
its polygon so it might be bullshit https://www.polygon.com/2018/12/3/18124428/destiny-2-black-armory-leaked-cutscene-guardian-revived

The game had more twitch viewers than fortnite for the crown of sorrow race to worlds first...

whats your problem with the post though

It looks like warmind armor with the arms or feedback fence

Will I have to re buy it?

How old is the Young Wolf now? Four or five years?

While season of opulence is good so far I thought the same thing about jokers wild and I ended up dropping destiny after a wee or so because I was already tired of gambit shit.
---
Many think it has to do with bad juju... And that these will be similar to dreaming cities corrupted eggs
---
Just let it die. Ignore the whole company until they lose big and beg us to come back.
---
You got to play for almost two years.
---
Same and same. Foxxyz95, add me when u can :). Leave a comment tho so i know it's you!
---
These weapons' quests require the annual pass.
---
I think more accurate is, "Moon's *STILL* haunted."
---
Can you get selfie in eververse rn? Ive been waiting for that forever too.
---
Yes it will as the whole base game is free to play in September
---
I wanna put it on my ssd so bad but it just can’t happen
---
I’ve spent $310 on this series and temporarily quit playing after curse of osiris, I’m perfectly happy with warmind, forsaken, and the annual pass.
---
Yes. [Source](https://www.bungie.net/en-US/Explore/Detail/News/47882)
