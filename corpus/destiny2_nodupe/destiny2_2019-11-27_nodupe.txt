Thats extremely rare tho. I mainly play as an i vader but when my team had a guy who knew how to do it better than i do, i switched. Jack of all trades works better than mostpeolle thint

You're looking at the wrong challenge, the challenge on the top it registering fine, it's the lower one which isn't, I am indeed light lvl 860 but I have surpassed the 100.000 points mark multiple times now and it is not registering, I don't think I need to be light lvl 900 for it to register, I think it's just a bug.
---
Pretty sure it‚Äôs a dreg but ok
---
I‚Äôd recommend getting forsaken and shadow keep as the exotics provided in the forsaken dlc are one of the best weapons in the game like the Izanagi‚Äôs burden. Deluxe will give you random exotics in the season passes so they can‚Äôt be guaranteed to be any good

As a Hunter main I can only say I wouldn't expect a Titan to understand her.

Better, a pistol bayonet is basically a knife, but this gives you significant mechanical advantage.  The main drawback would be how front heavy it would be.  Axes are basically the lovechild of swords and maces.

I'm trans myself. I've been called a trap before. I've been physically assaulted for being trans. When people make "trap" jokes, they're signaling to me that they don't *care* that a lot of trans women hate that word, have trauma around that word, or have been harmed by the idea that we're somehow trapping men by being attractive to them.
---

---
But hey, be transphobic if you wanna. Internet's full of people who agree with you.

Not OP but I believe it is quite balanced console side, Its my favorite gun to use but I find myself quite often changing to ace depending on the map/loadouts of the enemy because it has a very niche range and execution with a controller. Still a beast of a gun but not as ridiculous as on PC by a long ways
---
It's still trippy though. He did it with sword, that's what he used the Heavy Ammo for. May have been a Black Talon though
---
Keep telling yourself that.
---
Its a 180 rpm, so it doesn't hit as hard as the other handcannon types, but its recoil is more like what you would experience on non handcannon weapons (gun doesn't kick back off the screen). Ikelos comes with Seraph rounds (super ricochet rounds) and rampage. Its a year 1 weapon, so it can't get random rolls.
---
It takes 4 shots to kill, so you'd be potentially trading away lethality for ease of use. The Vex Offensive Handcannon 'Optative' is another void 180, but it can roll with perks like killclip to let it 3 shot.
---
If you want to stick with the 3 tapping 140rpm handcannons like Better Devils, I'd recommend going after the 'Kindled Orchid' from the Black Armory, which is a void 140rpm that you can reliably farm for good rolls on.
---
I do when I am on the couch in front of the bigger screen and lazing around.

I mostly like crucible seson 5

My thoughts as well

Then how is it a ‚Äúcostplay‚Äù?

After the first mission in the Red Legion campaign, I would only trust him to guard my worst enemy, while my aim would be to kill said enemy.
---
I mean armor set
---
I will shoulder charg...wait no I will hit you with a really fancy throwing knife
---
That's cool, nobody tends to know what xur has until Friday afternoon generally and even then it can be subject to change an hour or two after he arrives. If you need to know his location for the week, you can check out this site: https://whereisxur.com/.
---
Cool theory but it's unlikely. Only the sol divisive worship the darkness, which is the minority of vex, the rest are against the darkness and the light. It's probably just a coincidence, and I doubt we will even see the future vex in D3 considering that the future vex were only seen in the infinite forest while the vex conquered the solar system, which we obviously stopped.
---
It‚Äôs up:)
---
My bad
---
Just take this upvote
---
Same, I've only played hunter
---
You‚Äôre right, he protected Ikora in the cut scene...no one can be trusted
---
Now that is insane. Since last weekend i use the wardcliff coil and man does it shred people. Last game i pulled an army of one and healed back one full bar of their primeval...we still lost because they had two warlocks, one with Novabomb the other with chaos reach so they just melted it
---
So what are we saying about the people on /r/trap because they identify themselves as a trap? Are the transphobic against themselves? Do they get marginalized because they choose to identify as such?
---
My group did one around 920. It did take a few hours and a few hundred revives though, and we got 0 score... but at least we got great loot.

They're espousing a narrative that's used to hurt trans women, so yeah, they're contributing to societal transphobia.
---
I like them all. Zavala the father figure(strong and duty bound). Ikora the mother figure (strength through compassion and understanding). Cayde 6 the asshole best buddy/partner in crime( light hearted/friendly/positive thinker to hide his true feelings of loneliness(he misses his wife and son ace).

K, now go kick it towards the iron banner station and you'll get a green ball, then kick that one into the door way to the right of Eververse and you'll get a black ball, then kick that one out of the top right hand corner's ledge facing the mountains and you'll get s blue ball, kick that one to the center of the bridge between Zavala and Shaxx. The next ball you get is a child of the Traveler
---
Weapon rewards have been removed from previous campaigns sadly. You can get a Y2 version by completing heroic menagerie on your Titan guarenteed first try. After that it‚Äôs a 25% drop (still heroic). Idk if y1 crownsplitter still drops. Probs could check dim or collections for drop source for y1 to see if it still drops
---
I like how everyone thought ikora was stupid for putting a vex portal in the tower but it turned out it wasn‚Äôt shit.
---
Get good
---
I have had a match up like this before lmao. There‚Äôs usually like one Titan on each team and then 2 hunters.
---
Rip - eyes up and all that jazz guardian
---
its all good man lol it happens to me sometimes also like one match it was 3-3 &amp; bam I got kicked
---
It's a patch change of a subclass, so everyone will get it. Along with changes and buffs to the titan and warlock solar classes.
---
Wether we wanted it or not we are on seperate platforms

Hold reload to activate release the wolves. Profit. It‚Äôs a burst fire shotgun with high damage and range so in pvp just shoot people and you‚Äôll kill at further distances than most shotguns. In PvE, it melts everything but bosses really
---
The white power ranger!
---
I don't think all vex worship the darkness. The ones that do are considered dangerous heretics by the rest of the vex, and have gone to war with each other.
---
Ether doctor is good if you want that archetype I guess not anything special otherwise thoufh
---
Id say farm the Exit Strategy from Gambit. Isn't half as much of a grind as recluse, but may actually be better at clearing ads after the nerf.
---
I know it doesn't matter, but just to clarify I'm also a girl. Still kinda confused if dude is gender neutral or not.

Ah I see, my apologies.

Based on your previous warlock post in certain this is a repost you karma whore

There's a consumable for you to gain armor when you do forge. Im not 100% sure if you need a frame. You can find it on the 2nd page when visiting ada-1

"I know, we could've won if I used my Blade Barrage on the Primeval, but this Taken Phalanx on the side frustrated me by keeping his shield up. Had that shield not been OP, we would've won, so blame Bungie on that one; my hands were tied"

Tangled Shore, you may have a point, if it weren't for all the effort put in to keep the Shore from being blown up at the hands of the Mad Bomber and if it weren't for the problems it would cause with Spider.

I have a huge problem waiting until next season. I've put a stupid amount of time grinding for the undying title and randy's is the only thing I have left. If i don't get it before the end of the season that I would have put all that effort in Undying for absolutely nothing..
---
I play a ton of Warframe too, so coming to Destiny I constantly called it "four" for a while.
---
But it says Goblet
---
Hahaha I am also 12 years old
---
Tbh the meta weapons in crucible are giving me ptsd to the point where i'm getting vietnam flashbacks if i hear them in pve
---
As a person who plays alone or who doesn't do well with PvP, it was likely that I'd only give Destiny 2 a try. Still refreshing though.
---
Honestly i just think the Great Disaster was poorly written. They inflated the number so much that nothing else lines up properly. But then again, Oryx was weakened, Xol was the weakest worm god, and Riven wanted to be killed, so I don‚Äôt think that these bosses really are the best metric to measure strength off of.
---
A real guardian dives off for that purple stuff.
---
i feel you

you truly are the lowest scum in history

Other than Thousand Voices and Divinity, are there any other exotics locked behind raids and lairs?

Tbh I'm surprised that guy miss his golden gun and that you live through all that lol

No d1 vets call it an ult, it is literally called a super in game

As the other commenters say, usually eververse. You can tell by going to the eververse store and looking at the wares, or by previewing the nostalgic engram to see what it can drop. Each season there's a different eververse engram.

I've haven't had much luck since hitting Mythic II last week. Its a bit of dread atm for me rn...üòÖ
---
600 rpm is a decent archetype and scopes add to the zoom, which greatly buffs damage falloff. Not necessarily the best AR, but a really good one.
---
I assumed you meant dan and dave and was really confused.
---
I agree strongly
---
J√∂tunn has a quest? I literally had to get it by chance in the Black Armory season.
---
Still gonna try to get that kill clip rampage Kindled Orchid though
---
I don't think you can rebind Overwatch buttons to button combos (as in, multiple buttons together), but it's been a while so I could be wrong.
---
Best thing you can do is look on lfg and send party invites to anyone good that you play with. It happened to me too, there is a definite difference in the matchmaking and difficulty level once you got mythic
---
Destiny is gonna have to do something pretty big over the next few weeks to stop itself from getting uninstalled.
---
Rolling scopes is something only Halfdan-D does. Zoom is a huge buff to effective range/falloff, much more than any barrel, which is what most ARs get.
---
He technically has a point, in that he didn't need to provide the info necessary to track down the other Barons.  Or provide the intel that got us into Fikrul's lair in Thieves' Landing to begin with.  Or allow the Young Wolf to bring friends into his territory.  Or allow them to operate basically unhindered.

You can only hold one override frequency at a time. You have to create one woth your stems, find it, create another, repeat.

I hate it. Nothing more to say. Except it sucks.
---
Alright. What do you despise about it. Let's start with that? I don't intend to change your mind. Since everyone has their own preferences. I used to despise Crucible and back then I never intended on even bother grinding for the meta weapons.
---
#ATOMIC SLASH
---
I hear ya.
---
I have him but I don't know how to use him
---
Agreed it‚Äôs really dumb especially when your just trying to grind out all the weekly and daily challenges, having to go back to the tower 10x to clear it
---
None of them. 
---
And I honestly hate questions like this because someone is usually trying to justify themselves or talk down to someone for using their super.
---
Its part of the game. Kill or be killed and move on.
---
Thank you
---
No problem! Happy hunting and enjoy the gun!
---
Rngesus smiles upon you.
---
Keep calm and use Solar of all classes cause they getting buffed..
---
I watched this I kid you not like 5 times. Still trying to figure out what even is that? That your sparrow or wtf is that ...
---
Oh that‚Äôd be cool. Definitely would make it more viable for me
---
All of the single cast supers (Ward, Well, tether, blade barrage(gonna get hate for that one), rocket titan, nova bomb) take a larger degree of skill to be effective. They take into account good timing/placement in order to be even slightly effective
---
Timing will of course provide a higher level of success with any super but it is much easier with roaming supers to get a consistent number of kills/objective control
---
And middle tree Nightstalker should have been like the sentinel Titans, running around with the bow with some non tether shots.
---
Like less heavy than a titan hammer but much quicker
---
Xur has been 'Not nice' to me and haven't given me Celestial..........I have maybe three other weapons to get but I want Celestial. XD
---
There's a giant tab on the left side of your screen that tells you what to do in the story and where to do it...
---
Ex. "Complete mission 'Fury' on Io"
---
And the game's almost 3 months into its third year so there's naturally going to be a lot of content available
---
He‚Äôs honestly just cursed. When I first started getting primes last year I was excited to see what gear I would get, but when it was just Edge Transit i was super disappointed. Now, whenever I get primes, I go to Tyra at the Farm, because she gives me actual loot (plus he Farm is a welcome getaway from the Tower).
---
I love that evangelion
---
Just one input: Crimson hand cannon for PvP
---
For a hand cannon I recommend Ace or Malfeasance. The Spare Rations is a good legendary option. Pulse rifle would be Bygones from Gambit off the top of my head.
---
I really love Exit Strategy from Gambit
---
Honestly PvP is by no means a big slice of the game. Not even half. Maybe a third, and that's if you're a sweat and want titles and accolades and whatever. There's really not much of a point in playing PvP unless you just like to do it because there's no worthwhile loot there. Raids can be fun and all but they're mainly for bragging rights and exclusive weapons.
---
People have been complaining about Crucible since D1 ain‚Äôt nothing ever changed üòâ
---
Damn man, as much as I hated trying to get Exit Strategy,  remember Breakneck?  Yeah, that piece of shit. 40 fucking games &amp; then it gets nerfed out of existence.
---
Stadia isn't worth anything at the moment. There's input lag, image quality is downscaled and it's way overpriced. Don't get burned, get the game on PC or a console.
---
If you can manage it I think a kinetic bow, such as a black armory one, would fit the bill. It‚Äôs a high damage per shot that doesn‚Äôt really have drop off for damage or the projectile, similar to a sniper or even scout rifle role. Draw times take a bit to get used to, but with the right mods it‚Äôs not too bad
---
You guys are getting engrams?
---
That's a random drop or Xur so will have to wait for that... Been using Last Word and doing alright in PvP. Not gotten a good sniper or shotgun to pair with it tho
---
As a Titan main I don‚Äôt even own One Eyed Mask. There‚Äôs more ways to kill than just using a shoulder or a shotgun üòâ
---
Hey man - so iron banner is up but the wizened rebuke from vendor does not have demolitionist -- was yours a random drop?
---
Can't argue with you. I just want to see if we can start a movement and show Bungie and other players why we play Crucible.
---

This.

I've had 30ish drops so far this season.
---
As long as all the prerequisites are complete for the mission I'm assuming you can do it? I basically had my friend babysit me through the first week or 2 back so I have no idea what you have to do for it
---
They must have change it because I did 3 for the ghost and 5 for ludomaniacal and I did both in one season

Morgeth: Imma head out for my people need me.

Hope he has as much fun getting the catalysts, lol.

Oh, that makes more sense. Tell that person to fuck off then.
---
YAY promote yet another way to destroy what little skill gap there is in the game, FL is a crutch for downsyndrome aids monkeys that have no gun skill at all
---
Out of all the guns you could've 3d printed in destiny, you chose one of the ones that would physically be hardest to print and assemble. Well done, it's beautiful.
---
I'm a catalyst slacker myself.
---
Very few have I finished on purpose.
---
Don't... pls
---
I'll try to remember to add you tomorrow. 
---
I've been playing A LOT of survival lately, I'm also on PC and have a few friends and clanmates I play with.
---
They call it "competitive" but your only competing against the other teams connection. When 8m hosting I do fine other times I can't make a single shot
---
Does Strike exotic catalysts drop from Ordeals?
---
Or you can play pvp it cuz it's fun. Well at least 4v4 modes. 6v6 is just mountaintop recluse or mindbenders
---
That thing know I use Twin-Tailed Fox as a primary.
---
Yeah. They're super grindy. I just main whatever weapon it is and you'll get it eventually. Some of them are a bitch and a half tho. Fuck zero hour, lol.
---
Also an alarming lack of safety harnesses for working on elevated platforms and scaffoldings
---
Since when being racist a convincing argument? Idiot
---
Same.
---
You‚Äôve got three characters which are intended for one of each! Try each class and see what you enjoy kost
---
I‚Äôll add to this with ‚Äò watches notes fall off the island in Garden of Salvation‚Äô
---
Wish there was a glitch in which special ammo would run away when you have mountaintop equiped..
---
How about have clear space on your character? I do think blues need to be auto dismantled though.
---
That‚Äôs destiny for ya
---
Am I missing a joke?
---
Honestly I don‚Äôt think it fits either path. Top tree is all about the fan fire, and bottom tree is about precision.
---
Then watch him jump straight into the portal armed with nothing but 2 autorifles and a dream.

I like to run code of missile and crest of alpha lupi

Maybe I'm just dumb

Don‚Äôt think he has lol

I'd like to be able to equip every piece of armor with every scavenger/loader/reserves/targeting.
---
the other mods that aren't related to weapons can stay as they are, that's ok
---
Have you not been following the story?
---
I hate when a game lies about rng. Example, 950 NF says exotics are a common drop.. but 10 tries in and still none is not common.. 
---
Bungie: that is common you fool :-)
---
On god I‚Äôm in the same situation I‚Äôm so angry that I pumping up nightfalls way past my powerlevel
---
yes
---
He got the finisher glitched
---
Rifled shits on your handling. I never use rifled without quickdraw. Snapshot sights is nice to have but is NOT a substitute for quickdraw.
---
Yeah, I mean it‚Äôs great for the player base which makes me happy. I just wish Steam and Bungie could be more vigilant with this stuff. It won‚Äôt drive me away, but I hope that the newer members will be as resilient and not want to quit.
---
its destiny, anything can be weird
---
Cheese wasn't the one to find it tho
---
Honestly the best excuse for anything in Destiny is "space magic"
---
Pvp has recluse and mountaintop, some of the best pve weapons
---
Sigma balls
---
You all just do it in time AWESOME
---
Both are full of content
---
Just by watching this, nades won't matter since it's "running away". Also... debuffs stacking? Unless somethings changed since... mid-forsaken, "weaken" debuffs don't stack.
---
Well I know for a fact that the game isn't dead. It's whatever sharding tech they use which makes it seem dead. It feels like at most there is 12 people on my shard/layer which makes the game feel dead.
---
The game has more players now than it ever had. Not sure what you are playing, but there are full rooms, matches, and planets everywhere I go. Are you entering activities that don't have matchmaking and not realizing it? How does exactly does it seem dead?
---
What do you mean their sharding/layer system?
---
Can we all admire that this meme got stolen by the Australian EB games Instagram account
---
Those are definitely British guardians
---
YES

i got you fam [https://ibb.co/LCBFGrz](https://ibb.co/LCBFGrz)
---
I see 6 OEM titans here, which means you're part of the problem as well
---
the fireteam leader will want to go in their inventory and make sure the item "five of swords" from Xur is set to 0 handicap if they have it. the nightfall ordeal doesn't use five of swords, so that could be one reason. i know what you mean though; i'm 967, and even at 0 handicap, i still get killed pretty easily if i'm not hugging cover. it sort of feels like a 920 without the champions. it's also possible that there's some weird scaling going on, but i'm not entirely sure
---
Wait, what? Tyra Karn can also decrypt engrams? I've only ever visited her twice, once for either Thorn or Lumina's quest step and once for Relics of the Golden age quest.
---
I'll accept that phrasing as well. I tend to be the sort who gets incredibly lucky with things that don't matter and then can't ever get what I actually wanted in the first place. Some days, man...
---
Yeah as I said in a previous reply. We kept getting matched against teams like this so we decided to fight fire with Fire
---
So... you solo-Blade Barraged. The question isn‚Äôt why you did it, but how are you gonna make up for it?
---
And when you get to repeatable, go to the moon and just to eris'.
---
All all simple and can usually get all 5 done halfway through a lost sector.
---
Dude I love this, could make a lock one perhaps? Pretty please ?
---
Haha, after that I got 2 riskrunners in 1 raid on leviathan
---
Cayde would be proud!
---
seems like it. I'm pretty sure the whole hive stuff was just to introduce the pyramid, and the seasons will be about things related/caused by the presence of the pyramid. in fact, in the end, the DLC was more about the pyramid then the keep. It was probably just called "shadowkeep" to draw the attention on the keep and keep the pyramid a surprise.
---
Stuff like this can not be sold, i.e. Bungie could sue him for selling copyrighted merchandise.
---
Losing paragon mods will hit you hard

I always raid with people I don't know. Try using LFG, the discord or the Destiny 2 Companion App! Super easy to find a team

It's a Jade Rabbit statue, they are hidden around the moon and you can feed them rice cakes for items. Collecting all of them is also a triumph. There are YT videos if you're interested. Happy Hunting Guardian.
---
I have loads of armour and weapons in my postmates with Kadi 55-30. Should I dismantle all of my lowest armour ?
---
IK right? That has happened to me a few dozen times on my comp life, on most teams I am at least able to just "beg for mercy" for the other team and exchange some emotes, until one of them tries to kill me at least, then its each for its own
---
I also prefer this guy's mom
---
Honestly it wasnt but okay
---
Baby yoda is crying :(
---
Yeah no competitive exotics, you know, other than: 
---
* Skullfort
---
* Saint-14
---
* Eternal Warrior
---
* Doomfangs
---
* Synthoceps
---
* Wormgod Caress
---
* Heart of Inmost Light
---
* Dunemarchers
---
* Antaeus Wards
---
* Peregrine Greaves
---
Yeah, just OEM /s. All those exotics are super useful in PvP and unfortunately they all pale in comparison to OEM due to how overpowered it is.
---
I main Titan and even *I* think OEM was a mistake, removing the overshields is a kinda okay nerf but the tracking is a big issue for me and everyone else. Either the other classes need a PvP exotic with tracking or no one should have it. Once OEM is properly out of the way, I hope proper Titan builds actually come back again and shotgun ape titans will stop being to prevalent.
---
Which metric?
---
It's amazing how little attention I pay to this when I'm actually playing.  I just shoot the triangle thing in the middle 'til it dies. 
---
Oh, in Destiny 2 they have frickin' laser beams? Same tactic! 
---
Notwithstanding that first time on VoG when your fireteam buddy suggests you go first in the Gorgons maze...
---
Except high glory ranks ;)
---
call it "I look like everyone else"

I wish I could give you one of mine, I have like 5 in my vault.

Could just do like titanfall 2 did, giving you two dialogue options you answer with the d-pad occasionally

---
EXACTLY THE FIRST THING THAT CROSSED MY MIND! *Shouting*
---
That Ramp is amazing
---
Fallout 4 had set expectations for it when it came to dialogue do of course its dumbed down options pushed everyone off, though destiny had none of that rn
---
I feel that pain
---
It's so shit I hate the way the Grenades bounce
---
I dabble with others, but this is my main kinetic.
---
It will still be A tier, just not S tier.
---
I‚Äôm quite diligent at picking up my engram from Xur every week too. One day I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll attrition it out, then get working on mountaintop
---
Imagine, if you will, a mission. In this mission, you have a small chance to be rewarded with a weapon. This weapon is rather good. It's so good, in fact, that it causes nearly every player to want it. Now imagine that completing this mission is the only way to acquire this weapon. Add in the fact that this weapon is also given random perks that change with each drop. Many of those perks are fairly useless for this weapon, while a select few vault this particular weapon into 'God Roll' status.  Having a small chance to have a small chance to get a 'God Roll' weapon, you'd think many people would be turned off from even trying.  And yet, more often than not, people elect to try. Repeatedly try. Endlessly try. Until they finally get what they've been laboring for.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
This is the Imago Loop from Destiny 1. And I can not tell you how many hours I wasted chasing a God Roll. But I can tell you that when I finally got one, it was more than worth it.
---
Sanding ABS/PLA is a bitch. That stuff is deceitfully hard as nails
---
Since a new season is starting in two weeks, a dry spell is to be expected.
---
I mean, you're kind of biased since hunters your main class. You probably won't realise how annoying they are.
---
Peregrine greaves would like a word
---
Jade Rabbit is more of a PvP weapon and Whisper of the Worm is a weapon designed for sustained high damage on a single target in PvE. 
---
I can't really suggest Jade Rabbit be used in PvE. However, if you like the feel of a scout in your kinetic slot you do have some legendary options that offer better perks that will allow you to equip Whisper of the Worm as well.
---
1. Night Watch: I can't recommend this rifle enough for PvE content. Pretty decent in the current PvP sandbox as well. It's a little faster firing than the Jade Rabbit, but it does God's work. I use it on a regular basis to run content under the 950 difficulty. Only thing that holds me back from 950+ is the inability to put anti-barrier/overload/unstoppable rounds on it for the mods. It can have some amazing rolls. The one I have has Rapid Hit and Demolitionist. Two very strong perks. With the exception of Snapshot Sights, most of the first column perks boost reload speed. It can also roll with Multikill Clip. I got mine in Gambit Prime at the end of a match.
---
2. Talons of the Eagle: With Iron Banner in full swing right now you have a week to pick this up at the end of a match or turning in tokens to Saladin. Has the same rpm as Jade Rabbit if you like the feel of that. If you want stability, you can roll Zen Moment in the first column, otherwise I'd go with Outlaw. I'd pair it with Rampage or Explosive Payload in the second column.
---
3. Imperative: If you have the Season of the Undying content, you have until December 10th to pick this up from Vex Offensive. It kind of gets overlooked but as a kinetic scout it's a pretty solid choice. It's unique in the sense that the first column can roll No Distractions, a perk normally reserved for sniper rifles. The rest of the first column perks, like the Night Watch, revolve around returning ammo to the magazine or increasing reload speed. The second column can roll some solid damage dealing perks like Rampage and Multikill Clip. Also is the same rpm as Jade Rabbit.
---
4. Nameless Midnight/Does Not Compute: These tend to be fairly popular choices, though I'm not the biggest fan of them. I think the perk combinations are weird, and both roll similar perks. Does Not Compute can be picked up from ranking up with Lord Shaxx or completing Crucible matches. Nameless Midnight can be picked up from Vanguard Strikes or ranking up with Zavala.
---
Others include the Wrong Side of Right (rng drop from Tangled Shore, so not something easily obtained), and Transfiguration (From the Last Wish raid, also not guaranteed to drop).
---
Hopefully that opens up your options a bit.
---
There are better reasons to be dismissive to Saladin than stupid early 21st century generational slurs
---
Cayde wanted to leave the tower and had sent messages to Petra and she said "oh yeah we need help thanks" and so he took off without telling anyone. Cayde never liked being in the tower permanently.

Definitely don't have to finish the Forsaken campaign, I do remember that, you might have to do his Gambit quest line first or at least a little bit of it

---
It's still gonna be gonna but nowhere near broken, at least not compared to other things that are currently in the game. Granted they won't be in the game when the nerf hits but who knows what other broken shit will be in the game next season
---
F
---
Are you lighting the lantern right next to the start point?
---
Can confirm, am unbroken, am 983 power
---
It got nerfed so I made a funny by exaggerating.
---
And also funny because you can actually dismantle it irl.
---
Bruh even cause got frustrated one time because we never spoke, but I geek out when I hear my guardian talk...I wish she did that more in the story
---
It‚Äôs so crazy it just might work
---
Ok cool, I will try it bro, thxx
---
Not a rant but sure bud
---
Titan no understand. This mean Titan less able to punch puny blueberries that try to use magic weapons that fling metal at Titan? 
---
(P.S. Actual titan main, here, that doesn't follow patches. What actually is happening in this nerf?)
---
New joker or new new joker? How does he compare to old joker?

I have no problem with spending it lol

If I have the money then why not spend it^^

I second this, they're a great way to get into raids. 
---
That being said . . . you'll probably want a clan, because the difference between LFG and a competent team is immense.
---
Blade barrage is a much better shutdown super. It's very fast to cast, gives you some verticality to make aiming easier, and does a ton of damage. It doesn't beat the damage of a nighthawk precision shot, and it doesn't beat the multiple kill potential of way of the outlaw, but it's easy to use and the melee ability and neutral game are slightly better IMO.
---

Isn't it immediately right after they stomp, so the momentum is canceled by the word attack?
---
At least, that's how I do it

It's possible. I got my from spider's bounty.
---
It's called pocketing a finish. You get an enemy to finisher status, melee at them out of melee range and during the animation move forward and hit the finisher key. That will "pocket" the finisher to where when you next melee the enemy will spawn in front of you. Doing it on a boss will make it it move backwards, and if you're sprinting while doing it, the finisher will yeet it off the map.
---
I personally have never seen this drop anywhere - got it from Xur when I had nothing else to get. 
---
It was top tier before the nerf - haven't really seen it since then.
---
Yeah maybe they should write better characters
---
Just realized my room is a darkness zone :0
---
Ok
---
It is, or was more likely to drop from the wanted bounties from Spider, but it can drop everywhere
---
Just pair it with Crimson, the health regen will be through the roof.
---
How about 'Yeet'?
---
Thanks for this.  I main a hunter (my only character) and I want to give the solo pit a shot.  Just want to complete it first and maybe flawless down the road.  Great read brother.
---
I don't understand. Do I need some arc-mod in my gear during strike to complete the weekly?
---
Srry I started 3 days ago
---
Yeah it's always a bit of a gamble. The only time I actually completed a raid was with a clan, but the people I played with are no longer in the clan.
---
Wow for a mod to reply to my post is amazing, ok thanks for the info

Sure, I'll check

---
Weather sent me home from work yesterday.
---
In a day I did my scour the rust quest, got a full set of iron will armor on my hunter, and got a spike grenade Swarm of the Raven. Pretty eventful, I'd say. 
---
Guess I'll have to go do it on my warlock now...
---
From what I understand it can be obtained from a world drop, so Nightfall: The Ordeals or Xur's Fated Engram (or any exotic/fated engram for that matter). But Spider's wanted bounties are just a direct farming method. I did the wanted bounties each week for 2-3 weeks and got mine that way.
---
I can't speak to how it is on PC, but it still shreds on console (at least in PvP). One of the few guns that is effective at shutting down supers quickly IMO.
---
Weekly bounties give more towards levelling it up. Vanguard daily bounties you can pretty much endlessly repeat. Do the Gunsmith bounties, too.
---
Yeeess, they grow fat from using lag switch on GoS.
---

Yeah and I've seen what it looks like. If you have NF you know how to use it. The guy with a 37 win streak didnt. He missed almost all of his shots and  clearly didnt know what he was doing with it.
---
Heath may have given a godly performance, but no Joker can be ‚ÄúBetter‚Äù than Jack. Jack is a... ‚ÄúDifferent‚Äù kind of joker, and I don‚Äôt think that I or anyone else wants to know what went into that film.

Thanks, just got it anyways
---
I've been really digging the Imperative. You can get it from Ikora's frames or just running the Vex Offensive. They drop hella often.
---
...so why is getting killed in on shot at range only a problem if it's not a sniper?  That's nonsense.  Fusion rifles, snipers, shotguns, these all kill in one hit in the right situations.  Counter it or use it yourself.
---

Hard ass grind for the thing tho

You're just bad at the game.
---
Nah it‚Äôs Wrinkles the Clown. There‚Äôs a documentary they just made about him, check it out!
---
While I'm willing to give the 37 the benefit of the doubt there, it's still an issue and over the past couple weeks I've been seeing more and more people with absurdly high win streaks and people using NF's who can't hit the broad side of a barn.
---
Good choice cosplaying the best class it would be foolish to lower to any of the other classes
---
Pretty sure you were banned for whatever your 'vague notion' is.
---
I think they're on par with each other honestly. Both gave a phenomenal performance.
---
Great work!!! Congratulations guardian!!
---
Dude i feel ya. All i want is doom fang pauldrens for a col void build. got every other pauldren and mask in the game. have not gotten a single chest piece though...so my luck this week will be a chest piece.
---
Can snowflakes please stop calling for nerfs because they got killed by a weapon?
---
Not true. Wormhusk took a bunch of shit back in the day.
---
bow kills on vex and cabal for exotic bow.
---
Oh shit? Really? Damn dude thank you so much, I thought my game was broken because I was getting only two mountaintop shots per brick and it was making me kind of mad, thanks for the help man

&gt;Wrinkles the Clown was a Titan serial cheeser who raped, tortured and murdered at least 300 veteran guardians and young blueberries 2018 - 2020 in Crucible, Destiny 2.
---
Clowns make people laugh, OEM makes people cry, like most on this subreddit.
---
what
---
Man i don't really enjoy pvp in most games but love it in destiny.
---
Can you say that for the 980 nightfall
---
I was playing non iron banner 2 days ago I think and I kept getting killed over and over again but some guy with a grenade launcher. I assumed he knew the map really well and was always going for anno but still it felt a bit off.
---
Sometimes I have to run that bounty for Calus and I just can't afford to be killed by random Destiny Physics. To the people this affects, I am sorry, I'm almost done 72/80.
---
Were they all from the final rewards? I've noticed that random exotic drops have become much more frequent in the last 2 or 3 weeks. I've had 5 or 6 drop from random mods which is about as many as I've had since release.
---
Because they suck at pvp and kick and scream until bungie nerfs whatever makes them cry.
---
Sometimes decryption can break your heart.
---
I love the one guy checking his ghost like: "Now what has shaxx been up to on spacebook?"
---
Does the hunter version exist?
---
I think that‚Äôs the point of the comment
---
Yessss...I've tried it every which way I can think of. Not sure what I'm not doing.  
---
Sprint, slide, hit melee while sliding. 
---
Am I missing a step?
---
The first time i heard Shaxx yell this at me i threw a grenade and got 3 kills with it in survival. All i do now is throw nades
---
It is not pinnacle, no. Only Zulmak drops pinnacle gear, which is always a masterworked piece of armor.

I remember the beta when we could only do a strike, some crucible, first mission and then chill on the farm until servers kicked us out. Farm memrembers.
---
These are all good but not cheese mechanics. If you want to use hunters to the best potential in pvp you use arcsrrider
---
The knockback usually gets cancelled by blocking already. If you press is right before the stomp you get life back too. Works for fall damage aswell

But that's 1 season compared to a year, or even just 4 weeks of IB... It's not really comparable, but as a Hunter: I despise the existence of Arc Battery &amp; it's outrageous that it has remained (the same) throughout the entire season

&gt;People just don't want to learn how to aim

Exactly.

Average is in the eye of the beholder, I don‚Äôt consider myself great because there‚Äôs thousands of people better than me regardless of me being in the top percentile. Just a matter of perspective

Typo = autistic. ok buddy
---
I like field prep for the ammo reserves buff not so much the crouch activated stuff. Have a hard time using a legendary sniper that isn't my 4th times the charm/firing line solo survivor either way.
---
Well that logic‚Äôs airtight lol. I don‚Äôt mean to sound like a dick. I just find it frustrating/annoying when things are posted that offer no context, discussion, etc. How are we supposed to respond to that? Theres so much junk to sort through on these subreddits already. And if he‚Äôs not expecting a response then why post to begin with?
---
I've got a metal Destiny logo keychain on my motorcycle keys. I need to find something like this (but titan) to add to it!
---
I believe faction consumables were used in the faction rally‚Äôs which included the thee factions of dead orbit, new monarchy and the future war cult. The ability to interact with these factions was removed some time ago because the loop really sucked. Bungie talked about revamping them but it never happened.
---
Hey OP, quick question:
---
What the Fuck?
---
And now we have only characters whom we don‚Äôt care about...
---
..... well... except maybe Asher.
---
I like the concept of dark guardians however if we have to chose between light and dark and Uldren is dark then I‚Äôm choosing light just so I can kill him again
---
Pardon him, hes a titan.
---
I'm just glad that it's only available for the one season, but if they do something like this again I'm honestly just going to quit playing

Raids are a completely different situation.
---
I'm in the same boat so far as well, but I've only turned in 1 bounty so far.  I was confused when a weapon dropped, but technically I guess it's still pinnacle hear, I was just hoping for some armor.
---
I never even get good loot from heroic event's so I don't even care at this point
---
true true
---
Come get some friiiiiied chicken! Cayde-6 wouldn't be a fan of him.
---
At this point I find more enjoyment in complaining about PvP than actually doing it lmao
---
Any non-hunters will get downvoted. Bitching and moaning should be one of their in-game abilities too.

Best shader in the game. Makes you look like you're straight out of Megaman

Dude  i frag someone from the air with this like 5 feet away

 One shot kill.

If that's the only activity you're doing that day, sure, I can see that.

Why is this handcannon so rare?

PLay the red war campaign, it has significance. That chicken did more for the city than most guardians. Respect him and his rank.
---
At least your teammate had your back haha
---
Especially now that it's free to play. Noobs friggin everywhere. I got stuck running 6 tier 1 blind wells because I couldn't get to the tier 3 faster than the others in the instance. Then they all went into orbit when I finally dropped the 3 in.
---
You can't lock it into your postmaster. When you lock it, you just can't dismantle it.
---
Didn't bungie say at some point that they'd make sparrows work in Mercury?
---
Hell yeah blueberry! Get that guy
---
I‚Äôd have to disagree. I really enjoyed his portrayal of the character and liked watching his overall development. Goes from someone who barely looks like he knows how to hold a lightsaber to a badass Jedi by the end. They even showed his internal struggles really well I thought. But to each their own.

Shhh don‚Äôt tell everyone

You can play casually and have fun. However there are things you'll miss out on playing that way. So if you're cool with that, it's worth it.
---
Where's this awesome picture from? That's my question? üòÖ
---
Well whats the point? The postmaster is just going to dismantle it without my permission after two activities that i down tower in between.
---
hey i play on pc but couldnt find anyone so i mostly played solo,can i join the clan?
---
You used to be able to get "tokens" on each planet.  EDZ tokens for example.  The only thing it may net you now is additional vanguard tokens or faction tokens if faction rally ever returns
---
Okay cool I‚Äôll check it out
---
Went to youtube to look at footage from World's First attempts for Vault of Glass. Descendant Goblins(and Hobgoblins) had the donut ring head structure, and Precursors were primarily silver. So it's been that way as far back as Sept 16, 2014.
---
No i dont think it‚Äôs possible to drop if you dont have the dlc
---
I feel the opposite way, 4v4 just felt super team shotty, especially with how the metas generally been since d2‚Äôs release (was worst in y1). I took a massive break, and 3v3 has been a welcomed addition for me.
---
Oh yeah, I feel the same too. Everytime, I manage to shoot the vents, but people still shoot the boss and it is always to late to make it heroic. I hate that. I feel they don't know how to do this public event.
---
Sole survivor/tranquility, don't forget
---
Sole survivor is better then tranquility if it has fourth times the charm and firing line, at times outpacing izanagis
---
Any spike nade launcher or wendigo paired with them is the meta
---
Stop acting like izanagis is the only gun that's good because whisper out DPS'es it, the reason why izanagis is used more is because of its pairing with wendigo, but tranquility and sole survivor can also be paired with it or spike nade launchers, I raided for a good amount of time since D1Y1 and it's okay to go off "meta" as long as you aren't useless and know your weapons strengths
---
I got more kills in ad clear encounters like queenswalk or strikes/Gambit with a damn TLW then people who use recluse, as long as the guns are decent, it doesn't matter, I played with dudes who couldn't do proper dps with a izanagis and wendigo, somehow
---
And for other encounters with closer ranges it's much better to use Acrius or LoW
---
In literally every other raid, and even for 3/4 encounters of GoS, I use Tranquility/MW Sunshot/Wendigo or Bad Juju/Sole Survivor/Love and Death, because really, you don't need artifact mods for them
---
The 2nd encounter is the only place with barrier champions, and the overload champions in the 1st encounter get obliterated instantly, really the only place champions are tough is 980 nightfalls and nightmare hunts, the 4th encounter only has a overload champions if you suck at staying alive with motes
---
Recluse is getting nerfed soon and hopefully exotics get artifact mods, really phasing it out as at that point it won't be much better then a rampage x2 smg
---
You might also want to look into a website called "Destiny Item Manger" you load that sucker up and can pull items from your post to your vault ez. You won't have as much of a problem then.
---
Hahaha ok i thought maybe there was a secret trick i didnt know about
---
That‚Äôs true
---
Hunters have that exotic, and it doesn't see much use at all, so that seems unlikely.
---
it is crayola, just magic flavored
---
The placement of the keys is triggering me
---
The top two are the same are they not?
---
Am i wrong or are we talking about a different uldren?
---
It gets on my nerves
---
Middle tree solar is my jam! 
---
You know, as long as my Hunter throws the knives, instead of lunging across the room to stab someone in the face.
---
Well then that makes it easier. Guess I'll just camp their spawns with jotunn for the kill.
---
As a solo player I hate pvp in this game so.... no pinnacles at all. It‚Äôs really annoying this game requires me to actually make friends *shudders*
---
Guess it‚Äôs time to dig up the Telesto
---
Not at all. Just saying if you aren‚Äôt there alone, maybe don‚Äôt unload every last machine gun round as quickly as possible, and just take a look at what‚Äôs going on instead. Why are they not shooting the walker crit spot and fiddling with orbs instead? Why are they shooting the crystals? Why are they shooting the shriekers? Why are they focusing on the drop ship? Why are they shooting the vents? Etc.
---
Everyone‚Äôs included in the event as soon as they walk inside the zone or land a single shot, so it‚Äôs really more about playing thoughtfully than anything else :)
---
Even though I run titan main....I still find this sooo satisfying! There can only be one!
---
Getting the raid exotic on your first and only run
---
it‚Äôs from weiner
---
Voice of riven? Is the you
---
I would guess they will let us grind for armor pieces instead of only being able to get one drop per week
---
I feel this caption

I haven't played Crucible in so long, I forgot what mine was. Where can I view my overall K/DA ratio?
---
Shoot me your discord!
---
that would be nice.but,by the time the next season comes,i will have all of it anyway
---
Well, unfortunately, I'll only have ny xbox for about a week. Had some health issues so I'm bouncing house to house getting treatment
---
Is this and season pass 2 separate things?
---
*eats crayon suspiciously*
---
Season rank. Not level
---
Let me guess, you probably only have black-dominant shaders in your inventory
---
Nice try, we‚Äôll get ‚Äòem next time!
---
I don't know of a list, but there aren't that many. There are some under Crucible, Gambit, Vanguard, and I think also the Moon tab of the destinations triumph section.
---
91 recovery. I love it.
---
Dang dude. I've played so many Gambit p matches farming exit strategy. A healthy majority of the players I went with and against were using the hammerhead. Didn't even know about before Gambit, and now considering farming it.
---
*laughs in black talon*
---
That thing fires with damn near unlimited range for only 3 ammo and does splash damage. I just hate how far it makes me jump forward
---
The Clown from American Horror Story 
---
*gives sandwich made entirely of crayons* eh?
---
Cayde-7 maybe?
---
I too am a solo kinderguardian. Wanna be friends?
---
The faction vendors are around, but they don't sell anything. Bungie cut Factions from the game pre-Forsaken and haven't brought them back.
---
Look at the picture it‚Äôs a nerf gun
---
And they're all one eye titans.
---
If you've used enough offerings to the Oracle in the Dreaming City you got a cinematic about Uldren being revived by a Ghost.
---
Look at the shader on the duke
---
*crawls toward sandwich like the ape I am* yum
---
Because I didn‚Äôt know about it until about 30 seconds ago reading your comment
---
Good ape
---
Go to your collections and get a bow from there. Just make sure you have gunsmith materials. If you have trinity ghoul, that should be the easiest way
---
How do you block with a sword? I've tried every key that's bound to anything and none of them seem to have any effect.
---
I don‚Äôt think people get the joke...it looks like a nerf gun
---
Yup. It's Iron Banner or nothing right now. Unless you're good enough to solo an Ordeal and get 100k.
---
I wouldn't think so
---
Black armory has a grind for a guaranteed bow
---
You should have as long as you need to complete it
---
My "Seasonal Rank" is 137.  
---
Season Rank isn't in destiny anymore. It was when you handed in parcels. You'd go up 1 level per package you received. But it's not in the game anymore
---
Nah. I think it‚Äôs just buggy
---
I added you
---
Back in D1, I survived a pre-nerf sun breaker Titan during Trials and we were both last man standing to win the round. Still wished I saved that vid.
---
Great catch!
---
Why waste the weapon parts on a gun you can farm in Menagerie? Unless of course he‚Äôs new light.
---

---
Name me one that will better deal with Barrier Champions in a 980 Nightfall, and from a safe distance?
---
Eriana's is incredibly useful for the 920, 950, and 980 Nightfall Ordeals.
---
Do you know the runes I need?

lol right? 'dabble' is the epitome of a humble brag for an unbroken player lol
---
MAAMAAAAAAA! JUST KIL- sorry wrong song
---
I've gotten at least 8 of these and I have 40 hours of playtime...
---
Honest recluse with anti barrier is better as it's great ad clear with good damage and doesn't take up your special ammo or exotic slot
---
I too came to this realization and it explains my .67 kd ratio.
---
Check your settings, they might've been reset after the update even though that may be unlikely
---
I wanna something about EDZ or maybe EP on Mars but I could be wrong.
---
The sweats haha
---
Is there any easy ways to farm exotic engrams on Nessus
---
You have to be sprinting for a couple of seconds to shield bash.  Unless you're in super.
---
I‚Äôve seen more reposts on this subreddit than the number of nuts my grandma has
---
Come the next patch, the knife WILL be a one hit ;) eyes up hunter
---
UV rays are my natural enemy
---
I know, but it should have been in the first place
---
After 701 matches, and 108 hours in the crucible in my "Destiny Career":
---
.77 KD and a 1.17 KDA
---
I've obtained Revoker, Recluse, Mountaintop, Lunas and am sitting at 4,304 Glory
---
Point being, if I can do it, anyone can
---
It‚Äòa like the portal scene in Endgame but way less cool.
---
Then title the post correctly
---
Its is one of my favorite exotics. Grinded the catalyst and it rocks. Like others have said hight lvl content it shines. I use it in the dungen mostly during solo runs. 
---
In pvp you can nasty 2 tap. Or use lucky pants and swap to a primary handgun for faster two taps.
---
Old news, but it‚Äôs worth noting that the order of the terminals activating is random. Not all of them activate per sequence. 
---
It‚Äôs too bad the ball can‚Äôt evolve into the huge Traveler-looking one, though.
---
Are you just having a bad day? Hunters are very good in pvp
---
It's somewhat worth the effort even though you don't get exotics over the course of them, unless you count the odd engram drop, but the XP is fine. To my knowledge Shadowkeep is the only one offering a full set of armour and an exotic during the course.
---
But this guy got was so still, I almost thought he was afk. So what he did was shine bullshit!
---
They are all effective killers I don‚Äôt see your point /s
---
Come to r/fightinglion we have some posts that are tips on how to use it.
---
As a hunter main, I feel like you‚Äôre not using all of the hunters strengths. Such as smaller hit box, dodging, triple jumps. I will admit I‚Äôve gotten mad at titans for the no skill shoulder charge or warlock pocket nova bomb but hunter is has its strengths also
---
I have a warlock friend and we tested all warlock supers against the Way of the Current. And it was indeed something when we saw how it an deflect a Nova bomb. Unfortunately you cannot delect the one that periodically damages. Dawnblade you can deflect as well. But anything else will kill you xD
---
It's in the image douchebag
---
I‚Äôm partly pondering on the fact that you actually got a snapshot Long Goodbye to drop. I grinded Insight Teminus nightfall the whole last week, 3 hours per day, with a 200k emblem. I got a Long Goodbye almost every run but it had no damn snapshots. None of them. I was very pissed and decided I was wasting my time. I really want a long goodbye with snapshots......
---
When you are level 904 and kill level 960 player in iron banner.
---
Here I thought I'm the only potato in crucible
---
How are you turning and moving around so fast? What's your mobility? I just came back to d2 and it feels like my character is wearing a neckbrace when I try to turn
---
This happened to me last night, I closed the force closed the game app and restarted the game then the bounties started working.
---
It's a week long.
---
Still Nub numbers soooooo
---
Well, we have shields, powered by the Light. 
---
Real answer &gt;!Hunters arms are too skinny and frail to throw the knife hard enough!&lt;
---
I applaud you, fellow guardian, for your honesty for I too am shit
---
Exactly my thoughts when i first played IB
---
That too, but in general, split based are pretty garbage, and invis is garbage. Grenades usually don't kill for us, and our supers take forever to actually start. Plus, dodge is fucking useless for PvP. Titans have shields, which is helpful, and, healing rifts, or empowering rifts. Both are helpful for pvp. You know what isn't helpful for PvP? Your special ability being a sidestep
---
I am having fun being a void hunter, bottom tree.
---
Stack discipline, granades last longer, suppression, even when i die i take 2-3 enemies with me.
---
Pairing this build with fr0st-EE5 boots, wich basiclly gives me granade, dodge and invisibility avaliability all the time.
---
They are called "shitlibs".
---
Can confirm. I‚Äôve got Melee binder to TAB from my days playing The Division and The Division 2. I don‚Äôt feel like changing muscle memory. Also the C was always my crouch key.
---
mini heart attack
---
I cant remember the names exactly but I'm fairly certain you need green runes unlocked.
---
Google the recipe.
---
You didn't just kill him his relatives and loved ones dropped dead as well.  Fuck.
---
I cannot believe the amount of these I‚Äôve gotten.  I don‚Äôt even look at what perks are on them anymore, I just auto dismantle them.
---
Is this a known bug or something?  I‚Äôve literally gotten 10+ of them in the last couple weeks.
---
This right here got my questline done for randys throwing knife. God that took forever.
---
*That moment when the enemy's primeval is nearly dead and a vet invader gets clutch.*
---
I have frostees, grenade is just a normal grenade and invis isn't actually invis. Still outclassed by other classes
---
Feel like an ass now, sort of bombed ahead during the nightfall to get it done, I was confused to why a dude was wondering about when I was waiting before I jumped in
---
You gotta use it right
---
Mida multi w/ *calus* mini tool
---
God i wish that were me
