If only that was a for sure thing, I suffered through that and got nothing useful
---
---
---
What emote is this?
---
Red War, Curse of Osiris and Warmind campaigns are a joke in terms of difficulty. Forsaken and Shadowkeep are more difficult, but not too hard.
---

---
The hard stuff isn‚Äôt found in the campaigns, it‚Äôs in raids, nightfalls and other endgame content. Campaigns are just for shooting a few trash level enemies and admiring the scenery.
---
No, problem! you're very good at what you do. Even cooler is that most of what you do are Destiny related. 
---
Im using Prismacolor Pencils but its so hard for me to layer and blend. I dont know the technique yet. I come from using Copics, but that  becomes awfully expensive...Is there a special type of paper that works best with colored pencil that you can recommend?
---
Xbox
---
Xur knows what you need even if you do not
---
Lol you don‚Äôt get it
---
I have Randy‚Äôs throwing knife, it‚Äôs very easy to get and I have a horrible K/D so you‚Äôre just really bad and ignorant lmao
---
Those are the ones. And the occasional Gambit bounty you get from the drifter himself.
---
Where is this bank/vault you speak of? Ive been just carrying everything since start.
---
I'm the invader with hammerhead xD 
---
Tho I don't ALWAYS go in, only when I have something relating to a bounty or sometimes the opposing team has too many juicy motes undeposited yet so I go in there to F with'em :P
---
So alcohol makes you better at the game...
---
It's getting fixed in the hotfix this Thursday.
---
The discount takes it down to a resonable price, its simply done so its only people who actually got the triumph ingame can reonably buy it
---
This reminds me of when I was a kid. I would run at my dad but he would just put his hand on my forehead and hold me back out of arms length as I swung wildly.
---
It discounts them down to like 60-150.   Its so the only people with them are those who earned em by doing day1 raids
---
I personally think Scourge of the Past is the ‚Äúeasiest‚Äù one
---
Eater of Worlds has the lowest barrier to entry.
---
Scourge of the Past is pretty similar, but more involved.
---
Ahamkara eggs. You can destroy them with Wishender. Destroying all of the eggs in an area will give you lore and loot, and destroying all of them gives you an exotic taken sparrow.
---
(You also need to shoot all of them for the Cursebreaker title.)
---
This is badass üëçüëç
---
I Genuinley thought this was a skin/ornament on a screen before i saw  the title. Incredible!
---
thanks bungie
---
Depends how long you've played the game to be honest lol. It changes slightly on a 4 week cycle as the curse becomes stronger so that could be why it doesn't look familiar. Or simply you just haven't been there for a very long time lol!
---
All the other fallen in this mission are house dusk, which appeared only during d2
---
Its phrased in a way that makes it seem like just what it is, an offer you misinterpreted it not bungie
---
I run multitool as well but sometimes it‚Äôs just too chaotic or I don‚Äôt get eyes on them until it‚Äôs too late.
---
Oh yeah, the "big banker" ones or something(where you must deposit 36 motes or more per match), yeah..... I feel ya...
---
yoot
---
People are just grinding out their Mountaintop and Randy‚Äôs.
---
The forges aren't available individually since shadowkeep, they are on a daily rotating Playlist launched from earth
---
Currently the flashpoint is on Nessus I‚Äôm not sure about the huckleberry catalyst though
---
Still kind of confused why they would put dusk fallen instead of devils in the cosmodrome first mission while not replacing the house of devil banners or the devil archon
---
Forges are on a daily rotation now that are launched from Earth orbit.
---
Press F boys
---
That scream was in my lfg raid group earlier this week.
---
Good trick
---
\*hE mUsT hAvE fOuNd sOmEtHiNg GoOd\*
---
Especially since their magic is basically pure willpower. Basically Bungie copied the Orcs from Warhammer who with enough of them wanting something to happen it will happen.
---
I wish you showed the team DPS. Your fire team must have been using pea shooters! Lol
---
You haven‚Äôt gotten any exotics except the season pass ones? If you really want one make sure to do all your ‚Äúcomplete 8 bounties to claim reward‚Äù challenges and when you‚Äôre not doing that do activities with tons of enemies. Like the Vex Invasion or maybe a nightfall since those automatically have a decent chance of dropping an exotic at the end. 
---
I‚Äôm rank 108 and have gotten I believe 3 exotics from doing the weekly vendor challenges I was talking about, 3 floor drops, and 1 drop from a nightfall. So I‚Äôve gotten about 7 random exotics give or take this season. By far though I think weekly vendor challenges seem to have the highest chance of getting you one. 2 of the 3 exotics I got from doing that were all in the past week
---
Congrats Guardian!
---
Yikesssssss thanks
---
I mean of course.
---
Why not
---
I thought it was actually the drifter before I saw the title
---
Like files of the Skull's 3d model, what printer you used, sizes, et cetera
---
crouching helps reduce the amount you get flung back
---
They just chillin
---
awaken the warmind was from season 3 eververse
---
Indeed, good luck with the burden. In the flip side though frames can be used at any forge
---
Was this on bannerfall and one of the kills was in the corridor coming out of C?
---
Wow that's amazing
---
Graviton Lance catalyst was tied to Faction Rally a few seasons back where you had to side with one of the factions go get it. Not available to drop atm, but will probably be tied to an event in the future.
---
I got a ton of exotics from playing crucible and i also got assassins cowl before i finished the campaign...
---
well alright, thanks
---
Not a problem. I'll put you on the list for Saturday!
---
Doesn't matter get on in there. Builds in this game aren't like other games. It normally revolves around synergizing a perk from a weapon or armor piece with your class.
---
I mean they shouldn't be dicks but on the other hand you should watch a video so you know what to do and dont stretch the raid out an half-hour longer because of wipes. Its common courtesy. Idc how old the person is or what they have equipped just so long as they know what they're doing and aren't assholes. Everyone is probably putting an hour aside to get this done, no need to make it longer than necessary by not knowing what to do.
---
what‚Äôs the armor on your warlock?
---
3 weeks...and hard on weekends..sometime we loose in less than 3 mins entire set. How are you as a solo player supposed to gwt through this?
---
What are the recommended stats? I cant use anything but Lincon green and I have access tI forge items but uff..the more I tweak the more I get owned..till I forget what crp used to work.
---
Like except 3 v 3 I can easy reset the rank..
---
It‚Äôs poorly explained in game but Amanda has the quests for year 1 content - Red War, Curse of Osiris and Warmind. 
---
If you purchase Forsaken, the quest is in the Reef you will see the mission marker when you open the Destinations of the Map. Click and Launch. 
---
And Shadowkeep, speak to Eris on the Moon.
---
As someone who normally avoids PvP, I actually love it in this game! Sure it's frustrating a hell getting one punched ect, but you just gotta work out how to deal with those situations and find a load out that works well for you.
---
So you‚Äôll need to start at The very top right of the map and the dreaming city and then once you go inside of the structure there you have to mostly Stay straight and only make right turns when you are forced to either go right or left. if you do that there will be some low-level scorn and some taken along the way.  once you reach the spiral staircase jump down to the bottom and turn around there should be some taken hobogoblins and taken acolytes.  go through there and you‚Äôll reach an elevator shaft, jump down to the bottom and you‚Äôll enter a large circular room and the two vendors will be on the left side of the room. 
---
I hope this answers your question and the two take 50 baryon bough so bring a lot with you.
---
I go almost heroic III to heroic II starting point everyday...past 3 weeks
---
4000-5300 is a soulless cesspit of salt and anger
---
Thanks for the tips man... yeah it never occurred to me that Amanda would hold the quests. I just assumed if I kept following new light, it would take me through the story. Well on the plus side I got some good gear Ali g the way :)
---
MOOD
---
It's alright but I prefer the taken king
---
I would suggest lucky pants because it looks like he has an ammo belt.
---
Better eat some taco bell or you won't get enough final blows to the toilet before the end of the season!
---
Lmfao I love when that happens, cause I have 200+ completions and 2 man etc... Jokes on them haha
---
Honestly the damage is fine, it's the fucking explosive radius that's absolutely bonkers. Shit can miss you by 5m and still kill once it explodes.
---
Maybe you're relying on your classes abilities too much? 
---
Im running Nova Warp myself and honestly only ability i use is Healing Rift and that one i only use because it allows me to look around the corner with 3rd person perspective. I played countless games where i didnt pop my super once. 
---
I just rely on guns and radar most of the time, i use handheld supernova when i notice someone pushing into me with a shotgun, but i end up dying to it quite often anyway because i refuse to run Contraverse Hold because im too addicted to those gloves that give reload and ready speed to guns. 
---
I really like Crucible myself, but i can understand people not being into it because the game draws most players with Raids and Strikes, not many start playing D2 because they want pvp.
---
I understand fellow d1‚Äôs
---
You make my drawings look like they were done by baboons! üòÜ
---
Its not being ruined. Sorry you are getting beaten. But it happens. Stop complaining. 
---
Whenever that gets a nerf because the community is an absolute crybaby about everything, they will move on to complaining about the next thing that keeps killing them.
---
I am a warlock, haven't played titan since launch. Not biased, I do get killed by titans, but I also get killed by hunters and other warlocks as well.
---
3 weeks yo yo between heroic II AND III almost reset back to start points by end of day.
---
Oh yea, it's been awhile.
---
Go to the lfg crucible channel I got carried from 1900 to fable for that sweet recluse so I don‚Äôt have to torment my other teammates in competitive lol  
---
I got a lot better playing none survival and get top3 all the time but I just can‚Äôt do survival with people who got gg weapon and can snipe long range or hand cannon 2-3 tap me.. when I haven‚Äôt  even get close to my effective recluse range yet.
---
I‚Äôm 957 without doing any pinnacle grinds, just normal casual leveling.
---
We have something called a looking for group area.
---
I just want it for my Void build with Monte Carlo lol but I'll do that, thanks
---
OH!  im all out of context lol. Hammer head is the machine gun the person is recording holding. I read the title wrong and assumed person recording was you, the person with only 1 hour in game
---
I miss dad
---
That is not leaves, that is what Vex poop looks like.
---
There is a small chance that was me
---
If wei ning were still alive, she could probably destroy the hip with her bare hands
---
With their biology, you never know...
---
Some of them could even lay eggs!
---
Lmao
---
Yeah thats the new intro mission that dropped this season. After that its just D2 stuff.
---
r/ihadastroke
---
He will die... and all of his characters will be deleted
---
Where Werner used to be.
---
Definitely 2nd place. It had some really great soundtracks, and a pretty good campaign too. It gave us 2 cool location, with The Dreaming City personally being my favorite. Not to mention the amazing raid that was also in there, by far my favorite raid so far. It was honestly a great DLC, and the beginning of the turning point in Destiny‚Äôs career.
---
Nice little piece of carving there. Keep working on that skill and it'll pay off handsomely over the course of your life.
---
And altar of sorrow
---
*surprisingly beautiful
---
Why... why is this so relatable
---
I‚Äôm just picturing Shaxx goring someone with his single horn
---
The exact armor is only available in D1. A close substitute for D2 armor would be the icarus drifter helmet and chest piece (crytarch engram). Guanlets Id go with intrepid discovery if you have the ornament. Boots Id run lucky pants, dead end cure (crytarch engram) or took offense (vanguard) for the class item, the closest to the collar would be took offense, but personally I don't think there is a close alternative to it in D2.
---
Ive only got like 2, your loot counter is busted
---
G a t h e r   t h e   f l o w e r s
---
‚ÄúGotta go faster‚Äù
---
Damn, ty so much, will try to see what I can do
---
The highest your gear can go without doing pinnacle stuff is 950. The additional power bonus from your artifact goes on infinitely.
---
There are some prerequisites to join the clan first, but you're welcome to join the discord. DM me if you're interested. We are a PS4 clan
---
That would be awesome
---
Tbh I get a ton from nightfall and I think that‚Äôs the only place I‚Äôve gotten them in a while.
---
That looks phenomenal omg. I love the great attention to detail
---
As a titan main, I can confirm
---
nice. its so nice to kill them asap
---
:((((
---
Saw one yesterday
---
Ohh, my bad. I didn't even know what you were talking about. I was on the one on the sparrow. My friend had actually logged on a dozen hours before I had started playing the game. He already wielded it when I was still in the EDZ.
---
Thank you, I had no idea what happened. I was really confused and kinda miffed thinking that they just made Destiny 1 remastered after what I remembered from launch.
---
Okay im listening
---
LISTEN UP GOOD PEOPLE OF THE CITY
---
.....Okay
---
Rifts or wards of dawn
---
Cameraman: last guardian standing
---
Or the more likely scenario is that they will be unable to find a way to fix it and instead will reset the entire quest progress for everyone who doesn‚Äôt already have it.
---
Brooo I got monte carlo from doing croat nightmare with 1 my crew and 1 blueberry and we killed it at the end I pulled most the weight then I see an exotic pop and it was monte carlo!!!
---
Chain kill them with some Cabal drop-pod equivalent weapon?  If the Guardians were close enough to each other, they could get it done with one ship.
---
Probably got lust during a hyperspace jump. Plural zone beings should avoid them. ~~^(sorry can't think about anything else everytime I see this Fenchurch name.)~~
---
Yeah, but that was Destiny 2 players, not canonical Guardians.
---
Were a month in...... You should know this already.
---
Ya I got tarrabah on my second cos run and I was done with crown (also I posted this like 3 months ago on a different destiny reddit before I knew this one was a thing and I wanted to post it here, I have since gotten anarchy and I love it as well)
---
Haha titan eat crayon.
---
please laugh.
---
Many questions are brought with shadowkeep. Why does Zavala still insult us for avenging Cayde? Why doesnt the grass on your ship catch fire? Why and oh god why does ikora think it‚Äôs ok to build a vex gate in the tower?!
---
Yes I know, my title is missing a word.
---
Nah doubt they would do that I'm just hoping this "fix" will actually fix the quest
---
All the feels!
---
Bottom tree voidwalker, devour is one of the best perks in the game
---
Dude, if you could just reaquire God rolls then why would anyone do their last wish runs or anything at all?
---
Stop Guardian! You‚Äôre scaring them!
---
Thanks for your feedback
---
To be fair the thing is a beast in crucible, auto rifle range, low ttk, and the perk procs after just a couple kills and then sheds everything in front of you faster than recluse
---
Devour is great. I played void until the middle tree dawnbreaker came out. Void is still so great.
---
Nah, it will explode for sure.
---
Great PvE item for bottom tree strikers.
---
Pumch- shoot/kill- punch. Repeat as long as you have fingers
---
I just run as fast as I can whenever I hear a Super to save my petite hunter booty from being buttfucked by whatever roaming Super coming straight for me.
---
I started with D2, but when I saw Rise of Iron the Iron Lords became my favorite part of the Destiny lore. An entire expansion dedicated to their past and their struggles was really cool to me.
---
Lmfao omg üòÇ
---
Thank you thank you! I‚Äôll just leave.
---
its an ornament you can put on the base mask
---
did u put fire team on public?
---
Wonder who that handsome Hunter is on the left...
---
Omnigul?
---
Okay im pretty new and dont know what those are or how to put em on lop üòÖ
---
/join works going off their ID number. When using the official [Destiny LFG](https://www.bungie.net/en/ClanV2/FireteamSearch?platform=4&amp;activityType=0&amp;lang=&amp;groupid=&amp;) you can see the ID number next to their name.
---
Go for Outbreak Perfected you won't regret it. LFG for the last mission
---
Is it weird that I use Jotunn as a legit invading weapon when I ran out of truth ammo
---
\*me chilling with all of those except crimson\* also me: \*has an extra last word cause I like the laconic ornament a lot and want 2 separate guns for it\*
---
If Cade-6 came back he would be Cade-7. I mean Banshee came back 44 times.
---
Needless to say I sent the whole shipment back to Fenchurch
---
When I use BB my hunter decides to use his space magic powers to literally fly into a wall so the only thing my Blade Barrage kills is me
---
That's probably me. Sorry if I ruined your experience. It was the only gambit match I got army of one medal. I was trying to reset.
---
By the way, are u the one who tea bag me when I die after second or third time I invade?
---
Bounties, others for fun
---
it even says if multiple people are there, just stand by her in the tower and it'll say _____ and _____ are visiting a feathery friend
---
Ngl its really fun to invade with hammerhead and just slaughter everybody
---
If it does, then I will join you.
---
So you think they would help us? I mean they would probably go for the traveler right after but would they even go for it?
---
I believe so... it was bugged, they fixed that but, but in doing so it created another bug.
---
I was fooling around with Eriana's Wov in Momentum, kind of nice but cluncy gund, but snipes well
---
Is Chaperone OP? No absolutely not next question.
---
Damn so I may have to wait a full week to see if they fix it
---
To be honest it's done this way deliberately as to get players with no sence of value of money which is mostly children to part with there money the funny thing though lots blamed Activision for the micro transactions in destiny 2 and all along it was bungies idea üí°all anyone can do is hope bungie maybe put down price's or at least give more ways to be able to earn bright dust.
---
Jokes on you i got sweet bussines like 1 hour ago
---
&gt;Is it dead? 
---
 &gt;yes
---
  &gt;punch it
---
Been asking for this for a year
---
Was running hunter / titan. Called it quits for the night because everyone else was running masterworked recluse and mountaintop for whatever reason. Just incredibly irritating.
---
Please tell me you aren't serious
---
Hey u/imasterbatetofurries did you see the video
---
Tomorrow reset and a great way to level up your guardian if it's not already max level
---
Maybe touch of malice?
---
Easier said than done when I get killed by recluse and mountaintop every game.
---
Why does the crucible suck my ass 3000
---
At least once a year, I like to make some of my Kevin‚Äôs famous chili...
---
It's in my watch later queue so I can watch it in the morning
---
Wasn't destiny 2 originally announced around ttk but got delayed?
---
It‚Äôs fun, I would like that.
---
Okay why the fuck do some Wizards have breasts? Do Hive even nurse their young? Are they mammals, or behave similarly? 
---
Regardless, we‚Äôre four days in NNN and I hope I ain‚Äôt losing to Hive breasts.
---
That's really not a good point since railguns and linear fusion rifles are very similar in functionality and how they fire their projectile. As both use a large electrical charge to generate a powerful magnetic force to launch their projectile/energy bolt.
---
Oh boy! Another Edge Transit, it‚Äôs my lucky day!
---
I haven't seen 1!
---
I like ttk the way it is. I'm not a big fan of twitch shooters.
---
Ive been lucky I guess. I can honestly count on one hand the times I have run into those.
---
I felt that
---
I got an exotic to drop during a patrol I think and it was Stronghold (titan exotic gauntlets that are fun be completely useless). I don‚Äôt know the last exotic I got to drop other than from xurs isochronal engrams
---
Spinfoil hat, bitch!
---
He wasn‚Äôt in the mood for you to get a well timed run.
---
Its about sending message
---
You‚Äôre likely referring to song of justice. It‚Äôs no longer obtainable. Was a year one new monarchy faction weapon.
---
Yeah we got some nasty messages
---
My name?  What's wrong with the name Fenix?  This is the most distasteful post I think I've ever seen in this subreddit.
---
cabal really only consist of rank and file, besides commanders like the valus. the second covenant squad is about equivalent to a regular cabal squad. cabal legionaries are similar to brutes, centurions to honor guard elites, and colossus to hunters, and a typical cabal squad would have centurions and a colossus. I'd say a valus vs a hunter pair would lean toward the valus, though between say tartarus specifically and a valus I think that would be a bit closer. however covenant have an edge in vehicular warfare, wraiths and goliaths are pretty similar, as are phantoms and threshers, but cabal dont really have anything like a banshee, and if theres a scarab on the field then there's not much they can do besides throw regular troops at it.
---
Ouuuuuuu, a reposti! Reposti is not al dente at all, good sir. I prefer proper pasta. I‚Äôll see myself out of this repostaurant now.
---
#Caught another one smuggling wormspore out of the city
---
You mean the ENHANCE! Quest?
---
Actium War Rigs, and Battlepass ornaments
---
Haha, shows how much I know. I just put it on once I got it and haven't taken it off.
---
If he‚Äôs on PC, I‚Äôll help him. Waited for months to do that mission because I couldn‚Äôt solo it lmao.
---
Pretty sure the nightfall drops a full stack
---
Shhh... no ones told him yet.
---
I agree, midnight coup and kindled orchid.  I don‚Äôt personally use austringer, but I put in my time with the other two.
---
HEY CONGRATS! grinding for it right now, how long did it take you to get?
---
Missed celebratory dance opportunity.   
---
&lt;br&gt;
---
I'm not mad. &lt;br&gt;
---
&lt;em&gt;Just disappointed&lt;/em&gt;
---
Congratulations dude!
---
I'm forever 39/40
---
Ewww that gun
---
Go, go, Power Rangers!
---
Hell yea dude nice one
---
Yeah quick fighters like the banshee would be super useful
---
What is Outbreak Perfected? And I am on PC.
---
Can't believe this is a thing still... Same for me.
---
That was fucking sick
---
what did the five fingers say to the face?
---
Yeah Riskrunner, Thorn, Mida Multitool, Graviton Lance, Twin Tailed Fox, Telesto, Suros Regime, Synthocepces, and Dunemarchers.
---
Took me a few days of grinding only using The Jade Rabbit, and slight frustration from getting grenade launchered once or twice ;)
---
You should know.
---
He was done with lunch titans

yeah i feel that, im only at 44% i got a long way to go!
---
Impossible... Impossible!
---
It's not programed to read rarity, it just reads the physical number of items in the postmaster. Again, you made this choice, the postmaster is not a storage space. You can't be upset with this system, there are people who use the postmaster like a storage space but they're smart enough to not let things get deleted
---
They're upping the PL bump pinnacle gear gives from +1 to +2, so everyone should wait to do pinnacles Thursday, instead of Tuesday, to maximize gains
---
Sorry I was unclear. I meant tier 5 or 10, so 50 or 100 resilience. 94 resilience is the same as 90 resilience.
---
It‚Äôs still incredibly potent and can get you you‚Äôre super back if you understand how it works and know your environment. 
---
You can still get your super back a few seconds after using it, but it‚Äôs more limited than before the nerf
---
Okay but shouldn't anything that was released during the duration of that pass be added to my game on Steam as it has been paid for? I don't even know if anything was released, I am just asking. What the hell did I get for the money she spent on the annual pass?
---
What about my character? Are my log in details for the game the same, will my character and gear be there? I am downloading it on Steam right now and have not played since the game left Battlenet and went to Steam.
---
Friendly doggo, do you want a snack?
---
Friendly doggo, he‚Äôll never attack

Friendly doggo, he‚Äôs got your back

Throw out your empowering spores

Don‚Äôt give Aru‚Äôun sores!
---
Be nice to lost sector doggo and he‚Äôll be nice to you.
---
Are you console
---
it's a real shame as well because from just looking on the wiki for 5 mins you can see the game has a really good story, it's just not telling it
---
its all i play in my free time
---
You have to run pit with a hive mask on only melee-ing enemies including the boss
---
When did we start calling bad players "Blueberries"?... I'm a bit out of the loop on that.
---
No one knows yet. I think it might have something to do with the used toothbrush because of the flavor text
---
I literally just finished doing the exact same thing. I got Randys and Mountaintop just about an hour ago. I did the same thing in momentum with Jade Rabbit and farmed the catalyst and simply used fighting lion. The grind was miserable. I had all my final blows and calculated trajectory medals, but I was left with only 45% rapid kills. It would seem like every time I finally got my hands on heavy ammo some shitlock comes around the corner with super and kills me before I even have a chance for some easy double kills.
---
Everything will be on steam when you went one Bungie.net and activated crosssave.
---
So the Annual Pass got gifted to you but you didnt play?
---
So the Annual Pass got gifted to you but you didnt play
---
Well than that's even more bull.
---
The bet between ghost and cayde
---
Destiny 2 sold over a million copies.  There aren't over a million Guardians, canonically.
---
Terrible.
---
I did this with beloved on accident a couple time. Once I was on banner fall by the hallway by A and I aimed at this guy in the hallway and right as I shot another enemy came from the side hallway and I head shot him and bodied the other for a double kill. I think I did it a few times. I had some games where I was playing out of my mind I got a couple ghost in the night medals and some crazy shots for a console pleb like me who usually isn‚Äôt good at sniping.
---
I never activated something called cross-save.
---
Okay so it looks like I need to hit their website and look this up; thank you for the info. mate, appreciate it.
---
Osiris saw pieces of vex shrapnel scattering across all his simulations at mach 10.
---
I wish there was a team finisher that could be a cool mechanic for a raid boss in the future like instead of a wipe mechanic in his final stand you all have finisher him it would look epic
---
Drifter: Get me those Motes and I'll make you rich, brother. I promise.  
---
Player: So...they're worth money?   
---
Drifter: I mean...not directly, no, but they're valuable to me. I doubt you could get anything for them elsewhere.  
---
Player: Or is that what you want me to think?  
---
Drifter: Just put the Motes in the bank, man. I've got an armory of gear to trade for it and no one else on your team has a problem with the exchange rate.  
---
Player: That just means I'm savvier with money than they are.  
---
(Large blocker enters the battlefield, flattens player and takes all of his motes)  
---
Drifter: It hurts me to see all those Motes go to waste, but I still can't help but laugh.  You were saying?  
---
Player: (resurrects) Whatever. I'm going to get more Motes and leave without getting kill--   
---
(Invading opponent snipes Player)  
---
Drifter: Oh, sorry! Forgot to tell you there was an invader on the field.  
---

I'd rather get killed once by chaos reach than 5 times in a row by the same bottom tree striker titan tbh.

the game often has bounties specifically for getting finishers, it's not beyond the realm of belif that three people were thirtsy for the finisher.

Generally even the most hacked games don't get beyond 5% cheater playerbase until long past it's death. This includes blantant cheaters and ones that use either aim or wallhacks. (Which is somewhat common now thanks to the new game mode. The amount of people who know my exact location is staggering)
---
And consoles also have cheaters. Generally it's slightly higher than pc unless the PC servers have dead rats for an anticheat system
---
The craziest part is that after the fact you all just went on like it was nothing. No emotes or anything.
---
It looks ok, would look better without the fur tho
---
He must‚Äôve really done u guys wrong
---
Oh well then I can‚Äôt afford to get the season pass but I have the light
---
my mic doesn't work (something wrong with my controller) but if you guys are helping some people with crucible or gambit on the weekend hmu ill dm you my tag
---
That sucks

The fur is what makes it good tho. It would look like ass without it. it creates this regal nordic look.

Looks like Hades from GoW3

---
Thanks again. :) Any exotic armor you could recommend?
---
If one person gets pretty much every kill in every round, it can go that high. There will be 9 rounds, with one guy getting every kill on each round so yeah, just about possible. Still a very ignoble way of doing things though. Makes those of us who solo‚Äôd our way to 5500 glory feel just that little bit deflated, knowing that this shit goes on.
---
It was literally posted yesterday but fuck it people need to see it.

Could be hacking too, ive seen vids of hackers reviving themselfs unlimited times and no timer.

Want dat too...

Most exotics i got were from nightfalls 950/980 and quest...

(Only a few from crucible and powerful gear...)

&gt;Low-key lit as heck

Tether, yo.

This guy cheesed mountaintop, recluse and Luna's as well, I know how you feel.  I thought max no of rounds was 7 since winner is team who wins 4 games?

I don't know if it works with other classes, but as a warlock you can nade yourself and activate it.

I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a glitch or what but I‚Äôve already gotten 3 exotic engrams from the K1 Communion Lost Sector boss on the moon and I‚Äôve only been back on D2 since the update.

Infusions are an option, same as launch and the prior game. Select the weapon and go to details then the bottom left square is infusions.
---
However check your collections tab. Go to exotic and find the weapon. If you light level is up there, the collection light level will be higher. I generally pull them out of collections since its so much closer to my level and the collection pull materials are cheaper than the upgrade module for infusion.
---
Thanks a lot!
---
That is also what 1 ms on Titan looks like.
---
It works the same, just requires different resources as back then.

Also, you can go to the collection tab and pull any exotic you have from there with like -20 of your current light level.

Just had a wicked game! 22 double kills left!
---
I salute you fellow yeet titan, the national bird
---
Here's my 2 cents; Different classes shine in different scenarios.
---
Try playing that same dumb-as-fuck "i shouldercharge everything" in a 980 nightmare/ordeal run, where hunters can abuse invisiblity+izanagi combinations and other tricks, titan has zero access to.
---
While there's definitely things that need better balance (like hunter should be able to kill with throwing knife precision hits..), there's also a reason why the majority is playing hunter (myself included) and does perfectly fine.
---
Taken King was amazing my all time favorite dlc for destiny ever
---
Grind until max light, then infuse your preferred stuff up.
---
Actually, since it is survival, you can just draw each round infinitely. Meaning that everyone in the lobby could have got 1000 kills if they so pleased. Very cheap way of doing things.
---
I used to play Hunter while on Battle.net and my account got hacked and I will start from the start. So is the hunter that bad now? I enjoyed the kit a lot tbh
---
That's not what they're talking about. They're saying it would be really helpful if melee and magic melee could be bound to different buttons so that if you, for example, want to throw a knife the game won't decide to make you dive forward to stab the enemy instead. Or what I hate, when I try to stab a thrall but apparently it wasn't quite directly in front of me so my hunter throws a knife at nothing.
---
It's actually massively faster in momentum control with things like fighting lion getting you easy kills and colony spiders killing with a single detonation.
---
A clan mate got it yesterday, starting at like 12%, in 4-5 hours only.
---
Sorry, got no idea how to do that.
---
Yeah but isn't momentum control going away today after reset?

Not there for me

Here's a little method i use for Riskrunner. Use an arc sub-class and throw an arc Grenade on your feet. This counts towards the Arc perk if you're fighting non-arc enemies
---
Anything that takes green ammo
---
Well I know some quests give you exotics
---
More reposts then OC
---
And?
---
I absolutely LOVE my riskrunner. The catalyst is range and it just feels so fun to use. It works just like any other smg until I realize I got tagged by arc and then it's GAME ON! I also love pillager for a kinetic smg. Both are high rate of fire, fairly easy to control and still pack a punch. They are permanent in my arsenal (although I don't tend to run them together)
---
And probably have some Cabal sandwiches and Fallen shakes
---
Yes I understand what it is supposed to mean (and it's definitely not bows) ...
---
My point is it says AMMO like am I supposed to chuck an ammo pack at the enemy?  Lol

This is some power rangers bullshit. I love it.

If you play 3 games in a week you get a bonus 120ish glory points dependent on how close to fabled you are, it‚Äôs more the further you are from fabled) on the next weekly reset.  So if you get to 1980 glory and have played three games your bonus will push you to 2100 and you‚Äôll get the gun.

The "best" perks vary by weapon type too much for any kind of concise list, but this is a good resource for finding what ideal roles look like; they tend to be pretty similar by archetype.

Try the optimacy universal ornament I have a full set of that with the black armoury shader but a leviathan shader may give it a fancier design.

Ive had this for awhile, never used in PVP because, well you know pre-shadowkeep lol

how does it compared to Pluperfect?  Ive been running one of those for fun and its been working pretty good.  Mine Plu roll is outlaw and Dynamic sway reduction

and mix it with coin flip

Yes a six man screeb!! Sounds like a porno!üòÜüòÜ

Even if you do all the damage and someone just final blows all those assist
---
Well that is a better deal then the one they have in Fortnite I think
---
Destiny series &gt; most other games I play
---
For the final blows part is solar kills so you have to use a solar heavy machine gun
---
ngl i used lion to farm mountaintop and now i‚Äôm using colony for multi kills so i don‚Äôt have the right to get mad at jade users

This is what they do in Afghanistan....sounds normal to me

Nope. Just solar final blows. I completed that step with my Calus Mini Tool

that mintotaur corpse should have been launched into orbit. and when you guys finish the match you should see that minotaur shooting star in the background.

The reason it says ammo is cause there is a difference between primary and special ammo, regardless to the slot that its in. Im sure you already knew this though

If I'm honest, I liked Forsaken even more. Death finally really mattered and had an impact on the story and characters. Taken King is definitely 2nd tho.

Aaaand it‚Äôs destroyed ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Was in the same boat as you.. just hit 950 on all three characters last night.
---
I found that holding on to stuff and sorting was causing me to waste a lot of time. For armor, it's pretty simple. Decon everything that is not your maximum light unless it has particularly high stats. 
---
Weapons are a bit different. I mostly just threw them my vault and decided I'd educate myself on what is worth keeping/infusing and what isn't later in the game when I had the time. I.E. when I'm no longer trying to grind powerful rewards on 3 characters.
---
I think you need to ponch harder
---
Wait, to late now but how do you do that?

The only time I play control is when it's iron banner

Triple finish!

I finally got a kill clip outlaw range masterwork better devils but have the ace now...

It is totally political. Up until the 1970‚Äôs there were high school rifle teams that competed against each other - and there was like one school shooting in that entire decade. The idea that guns are the problem is nonsense. There were guns everywhere in the 1950‚Äôs and there were zero mass shootings. What has changed was how America deals with mental illness. Instead of acknowledging that some people are damaged and a threat to society, we pump them full of psychotropic drugs and declare them healed. Then celebrate mental illness as some sort of diversity victory. It is madness. 
---
Joe Biden created the ‚Äúgun free zone‚Äù where 98% of mass shootings take place. Chicago has some of the strongest gun control laws in the USA, and per capita Afghanistan is safer than Chicago. Politics completely surround the gun issue, and when I went to school in the 70‚Äôs and 80‚Äôs the boys all played ‚ÄúArmy‚Äù on the playground during recess with sticks we found that we fashioned into guns. School shootings are a new thing, something created because of policies created for political gain.
---
So do i but i never get drops , did u played last year on the event?
---
That's awesome man!
---
Yes but dont use it before thursday fix or it will disappear again.
---
Had that a few days ago. I jumped back in after not having played for months and really having a hard time with all the stuff. Got a key later the day and found another group getting to high levels in the event.

inb4 it was a killsteal on a low HP enemy
---
I think I am done with the Jade Rabbit simulator mode for now. Looking forward to iron banner and those pinnacle bounties now.
---
So you can get the enhanced ones by opening packages from saladman? And higher difficulty, does that include hero?
---
Well I have all of the masks except for Uldren and I‚Äôve done a fair amount of runs that went to at least tier 7 so unless it drops from a higher tier I think it is exclusive to last year
---
It is. There are a lot of under used weapons/rolls. But no way am I going to post about them on here.
---
No wait till you are on that step
---
Nice.
---
For the record:
---
Spike Nades on any special ammo grenade launcher kills all resiliences, black powder/high velocity/implosion at 4 or lower, concussion and blinding at 2/3 (can't remember which) or lower and proximity used to be a one shot and was nerfed back in season 5 to not anymore. Also sticky which is unique to mtop will only 1 shot with a damage buff.
---
Exotics weapons generally have utility beyond the damage buff, like bad juju also increases super regen, monte carlo does that for melee, huckleberry reloads itself, crimson heals and reloads itself, rat king has invis, skyburners oath shoots through shields, telesto breaks the game, sleeper causes itself to be nerfed, trinity ghoul some how exists etc. 
---
Recluse has an extra way of activating its damage buff, but for the most part its party trick is that body shots do 98% of the damage of headshots in PvE. And Revoker is fine, of all the pinnacles you could have listed I'm a little confused as to why you chose a pinnacle that isn't even the most popular of it's weapon type thanks to beloved existing.
---
I had used fighting lion and play of the game until I got almost 90 percent before I switched to orewings maul and colony out of anger every time the  heavy would either be on the opposite Ed of the map on the enemy side or some thirsty hunter would run all the way across the map and kill me from behind as soon as I picked up the heavy. I was on Vostok I came from a to b jump around the corner and saw 4 people around the heavy box and fired one shot from orewings maul and killed them all. That game got me to 99% which made me salty cause it was almost 1 in the morning and I had to get up early. It took me three more games to get the last double kill cause I‚Äôd always get the second kill just second or to late. I used the celebrate victory emote as soon as I got it. Though I swear some people play with no volume run past me waiting for heavy I get killed and they don‚Äôt hear or notice until they get melee killed combine that with teammates constantly running into me or blocking shots I was more angry at my team sometimes.
---
Oof
---
My understanding of pinnacle legendary weapons was that they are designed to rival exotics or essentially perform as an exotic without taking the exotic slot, which is why they are so hard to get.
---
I don‚Äôt have forsaken nor shadowkeep, would someone mind explaining what the heckums did I just watch?! That was epic!
---
I've been trying every time i see a screeb to finish one and i can't manage it. The fuckers are just too fast.

I get that you were holding that in, but couldn't you simply enjoy the cool picture of cayde without blowing up about the reverse uno card? You're like the Karens who got mad about Starbucks cups

Got nerfed for boss DPS, still great for taking out majors you can't/don't want to get close to.

Use recluse.

*Actually in my opinion God Roll Blast Furnace + Telesto is a op loadout

Thank God for Momentum Control, I would have never gone for Randy's without crispy headshot mode.

I play with a full team of friends and what we always do is have 2 on every point and no one can stop us.

Yeah seen a couple funny ones too but still, least there‚Äôs a name you could address them by, these are just.. idk. Symbol person lol.
---
Just keep grinding powerful gear sources and you‚Äôll level up in light level
---
You know the code is free?
---
Interestingly enough the grenade/falling fixes it because both are actually calculated by the instance server's physics engine, but shooting and melee stops working as that is purely on the player to player peer 2 peer side.
---
I only came out after this sold out. Tragedy :(
---
In Halo, if you died by mysterious circumstances wouldn't it say "Killed by the Guardians"?
---
Thats exactly what i did
---
You first try to lower an enemy's health bar. When they start glowing and a dot forms above their head, you then hold down R3 which activates your finisher.
---
By scales do you mean if you‚Äôre 750 fighting someone who‚Äôs 950 using the same gun, you‚Äôll do the same damage? In most crucible game modes yes this is how it works but in the iron banner this is disabled and I think it might be disabled in the survival playlist as well
---
They should ban all scout rifles though especially FUCKING JADE RABBIT

I'm a hunter main and i've had this question for a while. Is there any way to choose which dodge animation you use? When i see this clip of a hunter with this animation in combination with the reload dodge i wonder how you can have that. For me it seems to be, melee refresh dodge = this animation, reload dodge = the other dodge animation. Is there any way to change it?
---
Why bother to farm something lengthy on an account that will soon be ban.
---
I'd kill for dog themed ghost, but this has to do for now.
---
Better when you complete the catalyst
---
this looks a lot like it‚Äôs in a school setting and now there are heavy restrictions on that type of stuff. i‚Äôm a freshman so i know how school is now with that stuff and a kid a couple years ago got expelled from my middle school, sent to the delinquent school, and got in some deep legal crap for making a joke about a bomb. some kid overheard the joke and told the school resource officer which is how he got into all that crap. i don‚Äôt know where that kid is now but i feel super bad for him

Telesto breaks the game - laughed way hard at this

Do yourself a favor and rank up in Gambit, Crucible and do strikes... you should bump easily up
---
but he killed them with a body shot
---
Huh, never got one in 300+ hours of playing! Thanks
---
As far as I know it does not matter as long as it is an energy weapon. Matching the element creates an explosion when you destroy the shield.
---
In honestly didnt realize it was there thanks so much !
---
[deleted]
---
I mean thinking about it I really don't want to say my hours
---
Hard stuff. Like 980 nightfalls and raids and heroic (?) nightmare hunts. It‚Äôll say on your map if it rewards pinnacle gear
---
You do know that you can upgrade the energy right?
---
Hell yeah! I‚Äôve been saving bd for the broom.  The only reason I brought up buying it with silver was to lend credit of not losing it after the event.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt say what I‚Äôm gonna say is the easiest but if you do have the time then consider getting 21% delirium from playing gambit and all you need to do is reset once per season. Another is edgewise from strike quest. Those two are pretty good imo. You can find those quests from drifter and Zavala.
---
I thought you couldn‚Äôt drop full ranks, only sub ranks?

pretty sure this is stolen from r/CallOfDuty

Just enjoy not having it while it lasts. Monte Carlo is the only random drop exotic in Shadowkeep.

They been saying it on tweeter since last week and tweeted it out before the reset.
---
It does?
---
Are you playing with vsync?
---
You mean 1tb
---
I still dont understand the ammo system here. So i know the first slot is kinetic, second is energy and third is power but what's the deal with ammo types. Are they random? No weapon database online shows what type of ammo any gun uses. What if I wanted a good sniper that used special ammo and took up the kinetic(first) slot? How would I go about searching for that.
---
No
---
Ah I see! I‚Äôm a NL Guardian and have done pretty much zero bounties outside of the intro quests. I just do whatever I want whenever I feel like it (if it matters I‚Äôve only bought Forsaken).
---
Since I started in early October I have the following legendaries: Suros Regime (Xur), Nezerac‚Äôs Sin (Xur), Geomag Stabilizers, Apotheosis Veil, Trinity Goul, and the DARCI.
---
So two helms, boots, and a kinetic, energy, and power weapon. I believe the Trinity Goul and Geomag Stabilizers were drops from the Moon within ~5 minutes of each other
---
Edit: Oh yeah, and an exotic vehicle I got a drop from during a strike. The Otherside Sparrow, spawns instantly
---
Nah, I just got a new rig.
---
D2 Companion App, saves lives
---
Come one Better Devils is nice,I used mine for sooo long until getting Ace
---
What's the rest of your specs? And how many frames are you getting
---
Titan.exe has stopped working.
---
Press F to repair
---
You don‚Äôt get random matched.
---
Hi, There is no auto matchmaking for Raids. You need to assemble your own fire team. You can invite friends or try the LFG link at the top of this page
---
Thanks for this nice graphic! This is my first week back so first time reading thus graphic so I have one question. It says 6v6 iron banner at the top, does that mean iron banner is playable right now? Thanks in advance for any information :)
---
Correct. Seems a little weird for it being so soon after the last event
---
It‚Äôs incorporated into the raid now
---
if i understand this question correctly, there is no raid fireteam matchmaking.
---
Edit: matchmaking instead of matchnaking.
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs what I was thinking
---
Yes, that's exactly what it means. Good luck in there since everyone's around 950 Power Level! And remember to save turning in your bounties for Thursday.
---
I don‚Äôt really like that opinion. How dare you have it, sir.
---
Well the most efficient way to use it is like a normal hand cannon and going for paced 3 taps
---
Also isn‚Äôt there a hunter cloak from year 1 of the first destiny that had a halo reference on it?
---
Nope, that tiny pole in the cealing
---
I don't follow them on twitter, like a lot of players so I couldn't know but my point here is that in game messages should be better timed
---
Exact words I uttered after reading this.
---
There are multiple 160 legendary sparrows
---
Oh yeah? Just me? You're funny.
---
Probably the menagerie one. Can't remember it's name right now.
---
Pinnacle gear is supposed to drop +2 light rather than the usual +1
---
Don‚Äôt make this toxic
---
Oh i see. Youre talking about the function near 'find someone' under your friends menu right? My bad but yes. Companion app has been easiet for me. I didnt do raids till this season started cause ibwas afraid id get a bunch of noobs or just sweaty try hards. I find you can still get s skilled but chill group though
---
fixed odds
---
the scout rifle kills took me like 6 hours in momentum, jesus christ
---
How creative of them /s
---
3x2 so basically 6 times with no gun drop, is that common??
---
If it makes you feel better I got a duplicate exotic ship for completing The Ordeal strike last night.
---
It all makes sense now
---
I'd love that
---
WOAH
---
Oh come on I don't want to cry again. It was hard enough to do the last mission for Ace of Spades
---
I bought Shadowkeep and it‚Äôs is pretty good with lots of content but should I buy forsaken as well?
---
That‚Äôs a drastic difference, instead of needing +1 gear in every slot to level up further you only need a +2 gear in 4 slots
---
That's batshit crazy,man cus' Halo takes place (most likely) centuries before Destiny does
---
But I didn't think Flash and Thunder could roll anything but flash and concussion.
---
But the same one consistently 3-5 times without anything else dropping and with other people experiencing the same issue? The pool of exotics is so large that it's a bit wild to leave that up to rng chance.
---
The game mode made for scout rifle campers
---
Baby one time I went 20 straight dry kills, only got shader to drop when I was farming them.
---
Ah thats hot
---
I really enjoy Momentum. I wish it had more game modes like Clash or Supremacy tied in with it. Control isn't horrible, but with everyone camping trying to get scout kills, it felt like not many people played the objective.
---
However, it made me play in ways I never would have otherwise considered. Like, the quickest way I earned Randys was by playing aggressively with The Cut and Run modded with a sprint grip. People don't expect to get slid shot or engaged by a scout within smg/shotgun range. Ton of fun.
---
While there is no need to trash this guy for being proud of his kill, I get really bored of seeing these kinds of clips when I have been playing a lot of crucible myself. The sticky aim   in D2 and the strange hit detection when people are near each other allows for these moments to happen quite often.
---
Ok thank you
---
Indeed?
---
That‚Äôs so dumb
---
Np g
---
I saw another post similar to this where someone posted they got 100K on a Nightfall and they didn't get their pinnacle.  Maybe Bungie is blocking pinnacle's until after the 7th when the change takes effect.
---
That's what you get when you let your heart win
---
Has anyone come across *" The Architects"* as a gamertag yet? Would be fantastically confusing and highly enjoyable to see them dominate in crucible
---
*The Architects is dominating*
---
Damn..... I didn't realize. Thanks man.
---
I will do the other chars now till now I was just trying to get my warlock to 970 and not even touching other chars
---
Train
---
Warning, if you stand next to Ana bray for a period of time of 5minutes or longer it is scientifically proven to cause migraines from her complaining about the cabal.
---
There is a message when you start the game saying to hold on on pinnacle rewards or turn in iron banner token until the 7th
---
Again, its rng, the same thing can happen the other way where you dont ever get a specific one. That's why xur sells the engrams he does
---
Yeah and keep in mind the strike bounties don‚Äôt require the playlist so if you require a specific boss type just select it from destinations.
---
You got Sweet Business??? You bastard!!!
---
Forges are kinda broken rn, it seems alot of this stuff isnt working correctly
---
Shitpost?
---
I hope this time for real
---
Complete 2 forge ignitions...the ones in the EDZ bottom left, just do the forge and kill the final boss 2 times and you'll get it done.
---
Yes, Forsaken is a fantastic expansion
---
Me just now, "What do you mean I need a key for this seven step quest I've been doing for an hour..."
---
Ohhbmeeerrgod... Dude I have been spamming strikes to get the stupid vex boss
---
well, I guess it glitched then I already did 2 forges... Thanks anyway
---
I was gonna write this long message about how wrong and entitled you are, but most of Reddit did that for me so instead, I'll just say this. You mad bro? Good news lawyers exist. So if you were wronged in any way they will have your back. Call one up and if they don't laugh in your face hire them. You will get exactly what you deserve.
---
I get two kills in one life but I‚Äôm not getting the cold fusion medal?
---
Where?
---
I prefer to click and shoot each shot individually instead of full auto to help pace my shots.
---
New light here, already figured it out, that heroics are a thing, but sometimes I just don't know what triggers the heroic. I now prefer to wait and look at other players, who might know the trick
---
I used different things at each encounter, which one would you like to know?
---
And thank you for the kind words :)
---
If you go into iron banner at 770 you are going to get WORKED. You‚Äôve been warned.
---
Ok so couple things.
---
1.the forges are on rotation so even if they show up you probably still need to do the quest.
---
2. The obsidian shard is bugged
---
3. The entire thing is bugged just don‚Äôt do it and wait for them to fix it
---
I saw someone complaining about range on shotguns just the other day... some people still hate this load out even though it's been brought in line. 
---
Arc battery not included.
---
Man middle void hunter is so busted in momentum control haha.
---
"Dont jump in front of trains, Spartan!" - Shaxx in his previous life probably
---
Yeah me too
---
They need to be relatively rapid. Maybe 3-5 seconds between them? Idk the exact timing
---
You sir/madam are the good kind blueberry. I applaud you.
---
Im not sure what you mean here but just to clarify you CAN NOT get exotics from prime engrams. If you meant something else then please explain.
---
I just ran into a toxic Swede while LFG'ing GoS. Dude had zero spatial awareness with the tether, an extremely short fuse, and consistently put out the least damage - even less than the PL 919 account recovery dude. And the whole time he was yelling at anyone for the smallest thing and just generally being an asshole.
---
I'd say a large portion of toxic players are American because a large portion of players are American, however toxicity is not exclusive to Americans.
---
no
---
Wow! Put Speed Demon and Guiding Light and charge me all you want Bungie, make it happen! Nicely done m8
---
Take this with a grain of salt because I'm not the best at PvP and I'm on console, but these what I used last season to get Fabled.
---
Kinetic: Blast Furnace, Outbreak Perfected, Pillager, Dust Rock Blues (Cerebrus +1 is pretty nice this season with the catalyst)
---
Energy: Mindbenders Ambition, Calus Mini-Tool, Lord of Wolves, Le Monarque, Trust, Main Ingredient, Erentil FR4
---
Heavy: Hammerhead, Truth
---
I generally used Middle Tree Void with Eye of Another World and Grenade regen mods/perks for Handheld Supernova, and Shotgun or Fusion Rifle Scavenger along with Pulse Rifle/Submachine Gun Reloader perks.
---
I would like to know the last and the defense encounter please.
---
Im sad this didnt get more likes, nor got noticed much :(
---
Not possible. Chief would be a comboe of all three classes...especially the roaming supers
---
Yeah momentum makes everything instant kill. So if your going for Randy‚Äôs use a jade rabbit as it‚Äôs a one tap to the head. Fighting lion is a instant kill on direct hit and a very close hit, however you do need to learn how to use it first. For revolver just use a good sniper with high impact and they should one shot to the body
---
As I always say it‚Äôs my favorite scout
---
Yeah I know once saw a guy get three seven columns in one game

I ordered my solstice shirt after the seals and the shirt showed up first
---
Still great to have a legendary option!
---
So either cheating or severe bullet magnetism. Humans dont move like that. How it just instantly snaps to the head like a bot would. Hmmmmmmm. ..
---
This is too real!
---
You should see my commitment, I'll fucking jump around two guardians knifing them and somehow win
---
You have to get two kills without reloading or switching weapons. It‚Äôs easy in momentum control as even if only a few shots land they‚Äôre still dead.
---
Oh no the poor boy
---
I don‚Äôt know why anyone is surprised, shit was absurd in D1 too. TLW is one of the exotics that should have stayed in D1.
---
This sounds like suicide with extra steps
---
Always wild to me that people are openly homophobic. So bizarre. Bigots that protest the loudest are often the ones with the most to hide. I‚Äôd fucking love to see your internet history.
---
is the term FINAL blow confusing?
---
Absolutely. If everyone is chasing kills they just end up stealing kills from each other and completely miss the part of the game that makes those kills worth something.
---
Oh okay, thanks
---
You are 963 with artifact bonus. This is about getting to 960 without it.
---
You would care, if you would understand it.
---
Without a doubt
---
This genuinely is my absolute biggest problem with d2, pinnacles are literally just exotics you can run three of, I would have so many less problems if you couldn't run recluse /mt. Top /I can't aim sniper with any exotics at the same time.
---
probably why we all get wrecked by the trains in Warden of Nothing
---
No but I got shot by "OPTION GUN GUN GUN GUN GUN GUN GUN" icons in crucible last night.
---
It appears I had many options, all guns to the face related.
---
Oh i see... but i honetly dont see the diference
---
to be honest, i prefer to use that over my ace.
---
So it would seem
---
Cmon man, it‚Äôs too bloody hard to hold back the tears.
---
You can‚Äôt do this to a person with a weak emotional barrier.
---
What platform are you on
---
Maybe chiefs era was the golden age, would explain how humanity ended up with super soldiers aka Spartans and also had massive space fleets
---
Do you really not know?
---
I got it as a random drop.  
---
And before you guys get mad....
---
I don‚Äôt even think it‚Äôs that cool and don‚Äôt use it very often.  It just chills in my inventoryüòèüòèüòè
---
No I don‚Äôt have the money
---
Yessir, Xbox
---
Please where are the forges? Ive already read and watched like 30 guides and no guide is helping me. I cant select a forge in EDZ area because there is none there.
---
Are you guys living 3 months ago? Cause we knew this 3 months ago
---
Me: Who TF is Billie Eilish?
---
*opens Apple Music*
---
 üé∂ Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here 
---
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years 
---
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near 
---
Wanna feel alive, outside I can fight my fear... üé∂
---
Don‚Äôt worry dude... it‚Äôs okay to not be addicted to porn. I didn‚Äôt get it either. I was thinking the one friend who isn‚Äôt ‚Äútaken.‚Äù 
---
High IQ my left ü•ú.
---
I would watch Bungies Twitter for sure. You can also go online every Thursday, they publish a blog post about upcoming events, community stuff, and patch notes and hotfixes. You can find this at bungie.net
---
COLE TRAIN WOOOOOOOAAAAH! Shit not wrong game
---
Thanks mate
---
Buy Forsaken, it is a great expension and you will find out where he went
---
He‚Äôs just on vacation, don‚Äôt worry about him
---
Nope, Live in the UK
---
of course
---
ah. sorry sir, i'll get right on that
---
Me with the hammerhead.
---
Clearly haven‚Äôt watched any Pro FPS players, suss some shroud clips. Now what he does looks impossible.
---
ALL ABOARD THE HYPE TRAIN CHOO CHOO
---
This meme is meta AF
---
I‚Äôm 15, I don‚Äôt have the money.
---
Oh god...
---
Everyone gets it though so no one needs it tho
---
I know, iron banner is better than ever. In previous seasons iron banner just turned into normal crucible towards the end because everyone was the same level.
---
Between uncapped levels and pennecale drops, iron banner is more important to the endgame than ever.
---
Well i would say if you really wanna know you tube it... but warning you it‚Äôs a major spoiler
---
Don't do anything that gives out pinnacle gear what so ever until the 7th
---
Bungie says that that the problem should be resolved by a hot fix releasing thursday, but I couldn't find any other details
---
I mean there‚Äôs 2 for crucible and one for gambit
---
Very nice, been playing PC and can rock TLW, learning it on console now, any tips?
---
I actually played with the Ana Bray player in Menagerie
---
Fair enough. It‚Äôs just annoying to have someone not die to a full fusion burst or two sniper shots because they have more time then I do.
---
Ah then I‚Äôm not going to. Although given these answers I feel for the worst.
---
Let Bungie deal with that. It‚Äôs not our responsibility.
---
***NEED***
---
Best evidence to support that would be the Halo easter egg in Destiny 1. I think it was a solo mission for Sleeper Simulant, but you could find a scannable pod in the room after killing a Shade Of Oryx. If you scan the pod, I think the person in the pod was referred to as "117" or something, and Master Chief is John-117
---
It‚Äôs bugged. Fix incoming Thursday. There are well over a dozen threads on this in just the last couple hours.
---
Wait until it is on sale or something. It is worth it. But is huge what cayde did. You should take down that post. If you havent been spoiled now you shouldnt be because a troll comments what he did
---
Meanwhile in the distance you hear the faint sounds of agony from a fists of havoc going off
---
Newbies are generally referred to as kinderguardians.
---
I drowned out all my sense with the sound of it‚Äôs beating
---
Supposedly going to have a fix for it Thursday. Iam saving my keys till then.
---
He'll be back soon
---
When the fix launches on Thursday just keep an eye on reddit till for awhile. The reddit bug testers will either get it themselves and provide proof or ruin their progress and have to restart. Bungie fucked it up twice, they can do it again.
---
your not wrong. wins net damn near 200 glory and loses about -20.
---
It took 2 hours and 55 minutes of in-game time from having never seen the dungeon before/going in blind.
---
