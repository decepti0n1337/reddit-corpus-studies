I understood that reference
---
---
---
Why does that guy have that many keys?
---
Phones are hard
---
Damn that's a sweet pic.  I thought it was Rain from MK as a Destiny character at first, since the Osiris DLC was so forgettable.
---
This has been a persistent bug for a very long time. The way to fix it is to complete the campaign. Your reward engram will then be claim-able.
---
Can only get it from shaxx
---
Had to switch to lobbing hammers since I thought tossing shields would guarantee coming back... At least hammers are cheaper to toss away, amiright?
---
10/10 good shit fam.  You never ceases to impress.
---
Yes this stuff is per character not account. They did the same thing with season of the drifter. You‚Äôll have to progress your alt through the campaigns like normal but when your character reaches this point in the game the mission should be available. I will say that leveling alts is way faster than leveling your main so you probably won‚Äôt need it. When your alt get to level 50 just throw your max power guns on from your main and you‚Äôll catch up very quick.

WE ARE THE TITAN CREW!
---

---
AND HERE IS WHAT WE DO!
---
WE SMASH AND CRASH AND TRASH AND GASH UNTIL THE DAY IS THROUGH~
---
WE DRINK AND SINK AND DRINK SOME MORE UNTIL THE DAY IS THROOUUUUGH~
---
really? thats what you're asking about?
---
I hunger for **_L √ñ √ñ T._**
---
 Nah it‚Äôs just the model, it‚Äôs most likely the raid weapon set like the machine gun posted earlier with the hive carvings
---
Hey, I see your work on Instagram all the time! Love your stuff, keep it up
---
Smells like a filthy hunter main
---
Chieftan America
---
Ayyy now You're 15 votes positive!
---
Yes because asking about the three guns would‚Äôve been obvious
---
Trust. Trust me.
---
(Gambit weapon)
---
I believe Shaxx is on the farm and his rank up packages work, this looks like the gunsmith.
---
thats fair
---
ME A PUNCHER TOO! IT GOOD TO FIND MAN OF MANY PUNCHES AND DRINKS LIKE ME!
---
Always picking up after you boys
---
Could you make this phone wallpaper, like how much. Pls
---
Except if you read the lore the drifter works with the vanguard, they just kept aunor out of the loop
---
Seriously I will never understand all the Warlock jump hating, I main warlock and then I play one of the other classes and I can‚Äôt fucking stand it, the other jumps are so slow and short compared to warlock jump, it just takes skill to use but when you learn how it‚Äôs the best jump in the game
---
I understand that reference
---
Nvm I have autism and don't use mobile much
---
This comments section is absolute gold.
---
Ok but are you everyone?
---
You called? I AM the cheese!
---
His cloak is in the hanger where he stood along with colonel, and there's a picture of him in his favorite ramen shop
---
No it's really not true Titans are only decent in Gambit they are amazing in crucible and melting point bots in raids and trust me I am a titan main who plays when ever I can.
---
Titans need some love, bungo.
---
little did you know your boots had floaties
---
Looked like you were making jesus angry at the end.
---
Beautiful!
---
I kinda wish Forsaken threw it in our faces more that we're somewhat mindless killing machines, not caring about any consequences of who or what we kill and destroy. The Dreaming City curse being caused by our own thoughtlessness was a good start to it, but I think it would have been nice if the Barons were all Fallen enemies that we killed in the past (Like Riksis, or any of the roaming Wolf enemies, for example). And a revived Skolas (Skornlas?) as a boss, taunting us about how our sins will always follow us wwould have been fucking great
---
I love this pic, I've seen it before in black and white.
---
Theres a few more floating around that gave this same style, are they yours too?
---
Use it while it is still relevant
---
Imagine we aactually got warlock gear looking like this
---
That dude creeping back for a look... I died. Hilariously brutal. Well done, Guardian.
---
With strafe or balanced glide you can actually stop pretty effectively, honestly if you aren‚Äôt using voidwalker you should ALWAYS be using balanced glide, unfortunately voidwalker doesn‚Äôt have balanced, so you have to choose between distance/height and control
---
Yeah dude! For sure. Good luck tomorrow!
---
üòçüòç
---
Thanks! You too!
---
Do you plan on modifying the mask? Because without a tinted visor and maybe some greeblies on it and the chest pieces i wouldnt first guess it as a destiny costume. Great progress tho, and one other nick for me is the hood. Way to tight around the head, a much larger one would make it alot more hunter esc.
---
Ok..?
---
Eh
---
No clue what you‚Äôre talking about. Grinded our 3 full sets plus helmets for warlock and hunter, no issues.
---
Well that's exactly what I'm curious about, Hammerhead feels like it should be aggressive or at least precision. 450rpm for adaptive leaves them with few options for those frames.
---
?
---
Tess just sold the skin too and now they gonna nerf it.   Bunch of dickheads.
---
good job :)
---
He‚Äôs lucky that he‚Äôs damage locked, because my slowvas have NO mercy
---
I wish my guardian could look like this
---
If you don't like it, keep moving. You don't have to read this.
---
How long did this take?
---
multi million dollar companies dont usually care about giving credit
---
Mostly during the 3rd phase fighting champions. However, this happens during the 1st and 2nd as well.
---
I wiiiiiiiish I could!
---
Are you on console?
---
I'm a warlock main and it's abbyssymal and your reasoning is wrong, if you don't start it initially, you fall to your death, in PvP it's the most predictable shit to hit.
---
The length is the only thing good about it
---
Is it a PS4 thing?
---
Haha Insta down voted. Such a fucking stupid system. I suppose if you have nothing intelligent to add I guess, unsurprising given how cancer Reddits user base is and how abysmally stupid while always pretending to not be Destiny's community is.
---
I believe its because you can't go up if you fall off of something
---
Don't get me wrong Doom fangs will most likely be a boon in Menagerie, but even with the nerfs i don't see much of a change from the Hunter/Warlock preferences their abilities still outrole a Titans usefulness. This coming from someone who will ALWAYS run a Titan.
---
Dont use auto rifles in crucible, not worth it
---
Congrats, I just chalked up my first two failed attempts ü§ò
---
How 'bout "cries of Luna's crunchers rang while redditors grouse"
---
Why are we supposed to thank you?
---
No troll. 
---
I've got nearly 60 days of play time on D2. I love this game. But it's getting really tough to keep playing.
---
I'm frustrated that the devs have made this game ridiculously hard by nerfing our weapons, intensifying the AI, making our gear more obsolete by nerfing it, and giving us crumby "rewards" for grinding our lives away.
---
I don't know if this is a PS4 issue or extends beyond that.
---
I need to feel like a superhero with all this junk I've collected and time I've spent.
---
On pc its ace of spades/god roll mindbenders/god roll hammerhead or last word/god roll sniper with snap shot/god roll hammerhead.   
---
On console even with the nerfs destroying pc viability for NF/lunas those guns will still be the best on that system.
---
you did very well, especially for a first attempt! one piece of advice is this: if you can sync something big/loud such as a single gunshot, or a hammer throw, or oryx doing the sword slam up with a drumbeat before silence, it is much more clear that the gameplay is meant to match the song, and it's not just gameplay with music in the background.
---
Not really worth it in the crucible. If you wanna use an auto rifle then go with Suros Regime.
---
Saint-44 be praised
---
I guess he wanted to say that we are welcome at his home ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇ
---
Follow it
---
I just dont wanna get use to trying to get head shots when I'm suppose to aim for center mass
---
And punches
---
literally invincible
---
Unfortunately Retold Tale is one of the hardest shotguns to farm for in the game because of dreaming city RNG, so good luck if you‚Äôre going to go looking for a better shotty.
---
that's fucking awesome.
---
Darci has a higher dps so, not really unless you grab the masterwork catalyst, which takes a while
---
Right? Destiny is bad, but some other communities are way more toxic.  Overwatch on console is weirdly wholesome compared to its PC counterpart as well.
---
Wow the more you know...
---
I‚Äôll remember this meme the next time I run Zero Hour Heroic as a Warlock and reach the boss room alone while my Titan/Hunter teammates are still tumbling off the Tower wall over and over and over and over...
---
I will totally enjoy the next season, it‚Äôs just an issue many are frustrated with, they removed ADS bloom in destiny 1 im sure it‚Äôs not rocket science to tune in some way if not removing it, behind all the technicality of game design it‚Äôs simply common sense, but I‚Äôm sure the community as a whole complaining about game mechanics in general have a 4 year degree in game design and have all made 4 games over the course of 15 years so I‚Äôll just back off and let them do the talking.
---
Absolutely the best jump. Strafe glide gives excellent control and you can soar for miles.
---
Orpheus and shards will still be the best and only used exotics.
---
I totally would if it weren‚Äôt such an inconvenience to set up, plus I‚Äôve heard many complain the movement isn‚Äôt anything close to pc and more difficult to mimic using a mouse, and to top it off I would still have bloom because the game thinks I am using a controller hahaha
---
I highly recommend Ophida Spathe. I use it in gambit as it allows me to use my knives as my "shotgun" so to speak. That allows me to use a sniper as a special. 
---
I really enjoy this setup.
---
It is about speed, they believe glide is slow, not about the height. When it comes to jumping puzzles their glide is slowest compare to both titan and hunters. This what I hear from my warlock main friends. If they wanna fast run, warlock falls behind. Don't hit me, just messenger lol
---
yah, if you could change the last panel to spongebob baby that would be great. Srsly, hunters are the worst in cruci- wait, what platform are you playing on? Consoles or PC?
---
i got mine from a valor reset. im 100% sure thats how it drops
---
Ships coming in like pattern planes at an airshow dropping missle Titans on Free Willie...? Should be a cutscene IMO...
---
Omg
---
What about Nazarec's description gives you that idea?
---
More than likely will be Gahlran or some form of Hive, or even destroying the Crown itself. 
---
I don't think they would pull an obscure figure from out of no where and make it a raid boss. 
---
We will find out in about 14 hours I assume.
---
ok lore wise the ability to change gravity is fucking epic
---
This gun looks like it's smiling
---
I won't try it
---
Thx for the heads up
---
This looks like he's plotting to kill Xur because he sold sunbreakers AGAIN.
---
The dlc that‚Äôs coming out today might make it better.
---
Yeah I've been getting that strike a lot too, which is why I stopped doing strikes this week
---
thank you guardian!
---
Are there people who actually think titans are in a good spot because shoulder charge? There are hunter builds with LH that give you much more uptime on a significantly easy to proc 1 hit. Titans are actually garbage in PvE with the exception of MP and outside shoulder charge don‚Äôt have nearly as much synergy or build potential as the other classes.
---
Rule 15.
---
/r/sharditkeepit
---
Cubes is where it's at.
---
This game is good
---
there is! download remote play, it lets you acces your ps4 from any computer. u need a controller to actually play, but you can navigate downloads with the arrow keys, enter and escape
---
Nahhhh, just hyped up, its raid day after all!
---
They don‚Äôt really prove much, especially with people selling services that get the titles for you, like Unbroken or Petra‚Äôs run for Rivensbane.
---
The taken blight event is totally random whether it's heroic or not, look it up sweaty.
---
yessir ü§òü§ô
---
Oh shit my bad
---
To me? 10000 percent. Just if you do get it, it might be overwhelming, just do what you can, and enjoy the ride. But if you are in a rush to get caught up, definitely look into the leveling items (new quest to get you 690 gear and get you caught up).
---
Thx
---
Getting nerfed for super regain. Which it needed
---
I am personally attacked by this.
---
ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è lol
---
There is a trick to it, not sure how but I managed to get small upwards momentum, maybe rabid double jump?
---
This doesn‚Äôt make sense due to the fact that calus calls upon us every time.
---
Damn, they're taking all the fun out of this game.
---
*mouth breaths*
---
You have to boost as your character pops of the sparrow and you keep that upward momentum. The timing is different every time though so it‚Äôs like impossible to get down.
---
A true Legend
---
Dude let‚Äôs be real here skull needed that, getting your super back every time you use it shouldn‚Äôt happen all the time.
---
If you know how to surf you can definitely outspend hunters, and you can outspeed a damn sparrow with WL/0
---
Dude it‚Äôs a gun in the game that people use, stop bitching and just play the game.
---
Then don‚Äôt put yourself in a place where you‚Äôll fall to death if you botch your jump, then botch your jump. Don‚Äôt blame glide for player mistakes.
---
It‚Äôs both if you run gracelock last I checked.
---
I never said don't use it...I think I was asking why one would grind so hard for such great weapons to use them against fish in a barrel which takes little to no skill.  No need to apologize though , I'm guessing you will enjoy that nerf not as much as I will.
---
And for the record it doesn't hurt my feelings at all. I do get tired of being somebody else's "fish" in the barrel though. I just think it's crazy to go through all that just to beat up players who can't hold a candle to you anyway.
---
It was more than a migrain. His chart would be similar to this one, except in the end it would say "getting tricked into killing your entire mortal family, only to kill the rest of your family who caused the issue in the first place" picture of kratos
---
But getting the public event to trigger is random anyways
---
10/10 meme
---
Something\_Cringy
---
Same! Worse yet is that its unilateral, which makes no sense as it was not an issue on pc. Now its garbage and I wasted time getting legend.
---
Lol.
---
Same!
---
Racist_homophobic_etc
---
I might or might have not have busted a nut
---
That's not the Revoker, people. The Revoked comes fully masterworked. Wake. Up.
---
Definitely fake
---
CaydeKindaSucked
---
You should probably mark this as spoilers. Some don‚Äôt wanna see this until it‚Äôs officially announced. Still cool
---
Yeah 18 hours for the first raid time in LW is definitely trivializing.
---
Is this an r/woooosh?
---
I think next expansion will be on somewhere near Saturn. It's a theory, tho.
---
Okay, so, I've done something similar for [Joker's Wild](https://www.pcinvasion.com/destiny-2-jokers-wild-guide/). It's a guides and features hub that'll have everything I've written for the particular DLC or expansion. Since Day 1 hasn't even started yet, I'll be updating the page as I progress further and clear more content.
---
Additional example: It's also similar to this guides/features hub for [Total War: Three Kingdoms](https://www.pcinvasion.com/total-war-three-kingdoms-guide/).
---
xXShinobiPakuX2 I'd like to team up, I've got me and two other who would be willing
---
Brother, I traded shifts with someone today. Yea, I may have to work 8 in a row now, but I gots today off. Woot woot.
---
Every time a six shot golden gun invades it's one of those make right with Jesus moments if you're not actively behind cover. But please, pour the salt out for a hammer that tracks when it wants to.
---
I started my d2 update first I‚Äôm do my system update soon but I might not quite make launch
---
His will is not his own! He can't help it!
---
'become a slayer of nightmares' this phrase was used in the Haloween event. Doesn't seem real to me.
---
It's always the fucking Cryopod boss
---
I‚Äôm saying Fake for this. We may wind up back on the moon, the expansion may be Hive related. But there‚Äôs no way in hell the name is Shadowkeep
---
Why do you keep calling people who play quickplay things like sitting ducks and fish in a barrel? Stop playing the victim and learn how to counter.
---
Yea. His armor actually LOOKS like warlock armor. I miss the Anubis armor from D1 trails.
---
My crowning achievement was yesterday in prime when I banked 76 motes, lost only 3, got 51 kills, and I‚Äôm top of that clutched the win
---
It‚Äôs been out for an hour to download
---
PC player: Is this some peasant joke I'm to rich to understand?
---
Yeah downloading now!
---
I would say ‚Äúbetter than PvP‚Äù but it‚Äôs also the second fastest-killing PvP weapon, so...
---
First being Last Word, since Recluse needs the perk to match TtK
---
Biggest headache is when the name of the user doesn't match with the watermark
---
In crucible titans are the best class of you can‚Äôt see that you are either blind or in denial
---
If you're not battling the whole fomo thing my reccomendation would be to pick the activities you like for weeklies and dailies so you can hit max light and then any pinnacles you have your eye on. Exotics will come with time from fated engrams and all powerful drops have a small chance of turning into one.
---
Can we just get a D1 remaster already?
---
In Games and Apps... if it is not in the Updates section. Go to your Queue. You should see a list of recently downloaded items. If Destiny 2 isn‚Äôt on the list reset the console. Should appear in the updates section then
---
Ahahahahaha
---
What else? Well of Radiance is best super in crucible? You have no credibility, shit the top of comp is 95% hunters
---
Yes that's true. There was a meme going around about all event triggers being random. Started by a blueberry messaging another player insisting that all heroic public events were random, and was being condescending to someone trying to trigger the heroic.
---
I guess by the downvotes that the meme is dead and forgotten
---
I killed Pallas last night so that I could get to the hive cryo pod since to do heroic on the first you can't make the second. I figured 1 ghost shell and then two more is better than only two on the first one.
---
We in the golden age rice fields motherfucker
---
Still no word from Fenchurch
---
Now we can be proper Yoshimitsu's üòé
---
He's hookin up with Devrin at the church
---
Might as well give us pitch forks as swords lmao
---
That's why I went home on my lunch break and started to download the update.   :)

---
I got mine from an ascendant challenge
---
THE FUCK IS THAT
---
its likely that either your grapics settings ingame or your driver is messing with you.
---
new season ;(
---
Heads up.... I can't see any of my bounties or tracked quests. Let me know if you're experiencing the same.
---
You need to slow down while posting
---
Thanks. Never played that game, so this is new to me.
---
First dude is 737? Glitch?
---
Does anyone know where the pursuits tab went??? Because I just updated and it's not there in inventory. I'm trying not to panic since I'm still im the middle of several exotic quests I'm trying to finish
---
They have their own tab now i think, that's what i read! To the left of the map?
---
I am gonna test it out and see. Usually when it has DLC stuff floating around and you click on it it opens a page to buy the DLC but that hasnt happened for me : )
---
After you do the treasure map go back to Werner!
---
Scratch that, pursuits has moved to the map menu.
---
Yeah just logged on, press lb on map, it's all in pursuits now my man :)
---
The only real use for it in D1 was one-shotting supers in the Crucible. We'll have to see how useful these are now
---
Mine worked for the heroic adventure
---
I missed the moon so much! It was my favorite in vanilla D1
---
Nah probably saved up a ton of stuff
---
I NEED MY RAMEN EMOTE BACK DAMMIT!!! WORK NEEDS TO END NOW!!!!!!
---
It's just a DLC pack. Check the [image](https://styles.redditmedia.com/t5_2we4j/styles/image_widget_pun3vjbfh1131.jpg?format=pjpg&amp;s=a71c1fec3e2b13cddbcba86f6ce814e891a1b0b1) on the sidebar that shows what is exclusive to the AP (the bottom half).
---
It's been worth it to me, some people suggest waiting until you finish Forsaken since you only save like $5 for buying them together and a lot of the stuff is endgame content.
---
I can‚Äôt find my quest tab? Can someone help?
---
When they show up in the Reddit I genuinely feel these are all the people who would do nothing and get credit for a group project. 
---
I admit I was like "shit where did they go" at first then took 2 seconds out of my life to start looking through everything. And surprise when I found them. It has to take more effort to make these posts than explore. 
---
Feels like teaching my parents how to use a smart phone.
---
Where are the bounties now? It‚Äôs not in inventory??
---
I think people are getting confused. The Werner "invatation" bounty is not for challenges. The "invatation" bounty completes after the treasure map quest.
---
Oh wow that‚Äôs quite a bit. Then I‚Äôll probably get the one with a season pass. Thanks for your help
---
Bonus damage on airborne shoulder charge
---
[Appears to be.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D8O7fb4XoAEM6jb.jpg:large) I can't confirm since I'm at work, but I don't see why not. Good luck Guardian!
---
Ps vita + decent wifi at work + lunch break = problem solved
---
Yeah but 737 seems way too high.
---
Armor too, sometimes
---
Sorry for not editing it i was in a rush to get into the sweet sweet content
---
I only have 2 friends who play Destiny and didn't get any notification of a gift. I kinda skimmed the patch notes but didn't see this, so I assumed it was already known. I'll double check again tho if it was a gift.
---
It got hella nerfed,kill 10 ads,half super only
---
Killed 10 ads,only got 50%
---
Anyone else at 700 getting fucking **695** rewards from the Flashpoint? I'm fucking livid rn.
---
What does heroic actually do though? Like I still make it heroic anyway, but what does it do to make it better than normal
---
Where you the Warlock cosplayer I showed the coaster to on the 2nd floor? Glad you found them!
---
The only time I could see the reason would be if you need to complete a wanted bounty, but I have to see if the bounty completes without the need to kill them. If it doesn‚Äôt then that could explain why.
---
Dude this is nothing. There is a website charging upwards of $700 for not forgotten
---
Bright Dust can be obtained in game. Unless you mean there are some items that can only be purchased for Silver? I haven't gotten to log in yet today.
---
On the "Hush, Little Baby" quest what medals do I need some work and some don't i think its bugged but who knows?
---
Yeah that‚Äôs it. The quest is done after that. Do bounties and run the activity to upgrade your chalice.
---
Can you earn these in game? Please let it be so!
---
It‚Äôs so hard to come by tho I‚Äôve played like 500 hours and have about 2000, I‚Äôm really not a fan of this. 
---
I hope they get rid of ever-verse next season
---
So they finally fixed the timer cheese? 
---
Was hoping it wouldn‚Äôt be possible, but I‚Äôm not surprised......... in a week or 2 everyone will be able to blast through the mission anyway.
---
Ah, pretty dissapointing but ok thank u
---
Nah sorry
---
Nope.
---
Aww they fixed the six-shooter glitch 
---
I liked it
---
Wtf? How do you not have like 10k? Just dismantle the trash exotic sparrows and ghosts
---
Welcome to 2019
---
If you wouldn't be so hasty, you would have checked the old one that I've linked.
---
gotta make that bread man.
---
That‚Äôs exactly what I did and it works like a charm!
---
So wait.. If it's just Year 1 engrams, does that mean I absolutely have to buy silver to get the Opulance armor, other than hoping for good roll bright dust ones? And hoping I have enough bright dust..?
---
I don't get it...
---
They are both the same. Can you please use your words and explain what you are trying to show? Why can't you type out with words what you are trying to show people?
---
No, no you are not. Why would you care to be the first to receive an old exotic? not really something worth celebrating...
---
They appear in all hive strikes and no they seem to be immune to everything.
---
If I remember correctly, the bounties can be completed as many times as you want in one week. So you can grab them, do them and claim the Bright Dust, then go grab them again and rinse/repeat. It's boring and a little slow, but possible. I doubt Eververse will go away due to it being a revenue generator =/
---
Hmm, only theory I have is that they may be connected to the Lumina.
---
Whatever you set it to.
---
[deleted]
---
The Optimacy set is great, the SoO armor makes you look like a Wild West trashcan, especially the lock, they have an actual trash can lid for a helmet.
---
Go to director. Top right.
---
r/raidsecrets has a list of them.
---
You need annual pass m8
---
Trying man, got too chubby for my own good :(
---
I swear the SoO armor is the refugee armor. At least for the warlock
---
Actually yes, I lost count of how many times I've faced a titan rushing against me with nothing I could do except die.
---
Oops! Well, it still counts as a challenge!
---
Why do you keep saying ghost chalice?
---
I wish i had more enemies with bows, i could use some target practice with my sniper.
---
Because it‚Äôs prime time and everyone‚Äôs probably downloading the update as well.
---
Will do it now to confirm, thanks
---
I love warlock healing rift .but for some reason I can‚Äôt pick up new quest from that robot fella in tower
---
Its literally on the Season Of Opulence calendar...
---
RNG
---
You go in your director much less than your inventory, but objectives and your inventory are the two most used sections.  So now instead of those both being on the same menu, you've split them into two you have to switch between, one of which is much more seldom used, just making things take longer and have less ease of access.
---
It's also zoomed in and cluncky looking now, but thats a seperate conplaint.
---
Hey! Did anyone else randomly get curse of Osiris and warming when they updated their game today. It looks like they were given out free but I didn‚Äôt hear anything about it. Just curious if I missed something
---
I got that sparrow that blinds you every time accelerates. Love it
---
Since I fortunately have most of my load out already master worked with a good nova bomb and skull of a dire ahamkara I can still get my ult back in 10-20 seconds
---
Try the bottom right little circle thing when you are in the chalice page
---
