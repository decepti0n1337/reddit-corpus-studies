It's nice to be able to be one punch man now.

---
yah i am a spectral main you have a problem?
---
Ehhhh
---
Bullet magnetism doesn't actively help you aim, it just makes the target (a tiny bit) larger. You'd still miss if your aim was off by a significant margin. 
---
I mean if you really want to get into phrasing, it does *assist your aiming*.
---
Damnit primal i already took it down

Would Borealis be any good in the fight? It's the best exotic sniper I have, totally not considering the DARCI...

Excellent post

i would bet the house that every person in here is bias for hunter in one way or another.. there is no other reason to combat this claim especially if play the game and are as knowledgeable as some of you seem like your trying to be as far as saying "i dont know what im talking about" goes

Is this a post complaining about other people using Jotunn?
---
Its one of my favorite weapons to use in crucible because of all the people who hate it. 
---
There are always things that people will bitch about that others are using. Jotunn haters aren't special, just whiners.
---
LMAO. OMG, I started watching this in my Ethics class, and I busted out laughing when you launched your super. My professor gave me the stink eye.
---
you also didnt answer my question why you are so defensive to argue
---
Hit me up, @TD4Utah on PS4. I'll do what I can to get you caught up.
---
Yes the sub that has complained about hunter supers is biased to hunter lmao. Its simple you are proclaiming something with zero proof to back it up and get mad that people ask for it.

As much as I hated being killed by certain grenades at a higher rate than usual, it actually made pvp more interesting when the grenades weren't being spammed.
---
It kind of felt like how a Guardian might actually fight, with weapon and Light together! I will miss the tonic in Pve tho. Farming Nightfalls solo with grenadier and the grenade tonic and spamming scatter nades was absolutely hilarious, my dude. Ashes to Assets made my abilities up so often on Attunement of Fission. I think if I could have had Brawler, Grenadier and both Grenade and Melee tonic, that's the only way I could have had more fun. I actually used Top Tree Dongblade for once, and floating about spamming fusion nades just felt right.

Totally up to you. If you have never done Osiris or Warmind then probably do them atleast once. As others have said the boosts skip everything and bring you up to forsaken. You will have a bunch of quests for powerful gear to do at each planet and will have some filler gear. Keep in mind you skip any story rewards.
---
Because I am a actual destiny veteran yes buy destiny the complete collection and tell me there‚Äôs not grenade spam in the crucible if people are still playing
---
He just had a bad day, man, that‚Äôs all. Let a homie deal with his problems üò™
---
You call my ‚Äúinsults‚Äù weak however your rants say other wise I simply want to shake hands and move on and toss our differences aside
---
Well idk what to tell you, you are obviously someone who likes to solve problems and take on challenges but grenade spam isn't as fun as you take it.  
---
Challenges can be fun to overcome and I love a good challenge but grenade spam is more annoying than a challenge.
---
If you wanted that you wouldn't have made thses posts in the first place.
---
jokes on you. Night Watch plus all my gear is attuned to grenade cool down, I can pop my exotic Super Arc Soul after 3 kills and its last for 20 seconds, so basically i always have a wing man :)

I‚Äôll be the hunter doing unintentional tea bags waiting for my dodge to cool down.

I play Destiny, not Crucible. I will miss this.

And I could play riven‚Äôs heart like a bongo drum
---
I just stayed clear of it and got all my gambit stuff done. I did play one game and the skip grenades with Shinobi was way OP
---
Ow ehm well, i don't really know what to say about it. You just need to be careful, pick up as many motes as you can and bank them asap before someone invades you and just hide from the invader if you're carrying. It shouldn't take too long. The last step can be annoying and you just have to be lucky they are not too far away from each other. You only need to kill 4 people once so you can also kill the same player twice. Use wardcliff or an mg for it.
---
Probably one of those 1000 ping Titans.
---
Well mate hope you get it before the nerf patch goes live!
---
Besides the grenade spam going away what is different than before?

Even if I manage to get it after the nerf patch I am throwing the damn thing in my vault never to be seen again

One eyed mask eat your heart out
---
I see it more like this: set your self up to take on a group at range, get two body shots on multiple enemies while they are all moving around but then you wreck, plink plink plink.
---
I think I still prefer mida for overall useability at range (a good rolled distant relation or no feelings works too) but Jade is a god damn laser. LAZER. I‚Äôm working on the catalyst right now and it only really gets better from a stability standpoint. Even though the magnification is low it also has crazy range and can out duel most scouts with minimal flinch. 
---
Not the greatest, prob shouldn‚Äôt be an exotic, but it is fun once you find a good place to use it from.
---
Learn to pace your shots to be even more deadly with that iron
---
Another veery fun thing is using fusion grenades, ashen wake and middle tree sunbreaker, keep that ability buff at x3, tons of damage, deleted everything in gambit and forest.

---
Shame Blind Well matchmaking sucks for me. I pretty much never have a Blind Well with players. When I clearly see someone headed into Blind Well with me they just disappear into the abyss and I'm stuck with solo again. Same goes when I'm already in the Blind Well and I see a name coming closer and Poof! Gone.
---
I typically play reaper in Gambit Prime, a pulse rifle + Telesto for most enemies and a Hammerhead (with Boss Spec) for envoys/ Primeval. I have noticed that I do better with longer range weapons (like a scout rifle) but don't always have the time to switch. Also, Thunderlord seems way better than Hammerhead for invading but if I have that equipped I can't rock Telesto. As for what I try to do: find enemy and fire at them. Typically, I prefer my team mates invade and just let me steam roll the adds, that's what my load out is optimized for.
---
that‚Äòs true for some
---
maps but not for the majority. I‚Äòve spend a lot of time playing the last word + sniper and I‚Äòve not missed a shotgun even once. btw. scout riffles are good in gambit
---
Do this all the time its fun to see the panic when they fall for it while in super.
---
People complain about pvp being stale and forgotten. Then complain when it changes temporarily üòì
---
Or at least put it into it's own game mode similar to mayhem.
---
Literally me.
---
Ah yes, that would be my lovely Titan boyfriend in the back thinking outside the box there!
---
I‚Äôm a full on invader and I know a bit about the tools of the trade.
---
Machine guns:
---
The basic bitch of gambit, everyone uses them, and why? Because they‚Äôre good. A god roll hammerhead can obliterate you from across the map, and a revved up thunder lord kills super fast. The problem with machine guns is that they aren‚Äôt a one hit kill, meaning that you could get sniped before you land the last few shots.
---
Rocket Launchers: 
---
They‚Äôre good for boss damage, decent for dealing with invaders, but not something you want to invade with. Invading wastes way too much rocket ammo that could be used somewhere else.
---
Grenade launchers:
---
They waste less ammo than rockets, but don‚Äôt have much range. I wouldn‚Äôt touch them if I were you.
---
Swords: 
---
I don‚Äôt think I need to explain why this isn‚Äôt a great idea.
---
Snipers:
---
Snipers are high risk high reward. If you aren‚Äôt a sniper god, you normally have one shot. If you miss that one shot, that opportunity is gone, and the enemy player is just going to sit behind cover. That‚Äôs why opening Shot is a perk you want to look for, it‚Äôll help you hit some pretty questionable shots. Or you can forget aiming for the head and use Izanagi‚Äôs Burden or a Tatara Gaze.
---
Linear Fusions: 
---
Personally I would never use a legendary Linear Fusion, because they‚Äôre basically snipers with charge time. 
---
The exotic Linear fusions are what you need to focus on. Sleeper Simulant is a good weapon to use if you can‚Äôt snipe for shit, just aim for the body. 
---
I used to abuse Queenbreaker, but now it‚Äôs just a normal linear fusion. 
---
Arbalest is a great PvE weapon, and it can one shot to the body while standing in an empowering rift.
---
Fusion Rifles:
---
Telesto. Don‚Äôt try and snipe with it. You can try to snipe with Jotunn, but the death toaster works better at close to medium range. I‚Äôm not going to bother bringing up Merciless. One thousand voices destroys players, invaders, adds, HVTs, yellow bars, supers, primevals, the list goes on. The only con is the charge time.
---
Shotguns:
---
Invading with a shotgun is generally a bad idea. Same goes for purely melee supers.
---
Primary weapons:
---
Pulses are the best for invading imo, but most pinnacle weapons get the job done. Apart from Oxygen, that thing needs a buff.
---
Auto rifles suffer from range, and Scouts have trouble dealing with shotgun apes.
---
Supers:
---
Pick a super that is good with invading, but can also help back on your side. 6 shot Golden Gun is amazing for invading, but isn‚Äôt extremely helpful with boss damage.
---
That is incorrect it's 20 below your light level. I can make a gif tonight of me pulling a 680 piece of gear if needed.
---
I have, that‚Äôs not right.

Yeah, that's annoying. Always gotta twophase. Even still, meleeing a Primeval down to 1 bar is absolutely rediculous since it doesn't even use power ammo

Yeah they are but on the antlers ornament it says they only be visible during the reckoning

Boss stomp 2: electric boogaloo

upload them to OneDrive from the console then use the OneDrive app on your phone to download them to your device, that's how I used to do it :)

I used the Arbalest in gambit and I gotta say, it kills invaders really well
---
I got jotunn and after four months got lunas howl plus recluse all this weekend.
---
Imo they tried to hard. Too many updates, growing towards the childish wants of the younger community (random ass stuff) rather than stuff that is wanted overall. Don't get me wrong, updates are good, some of what they added is good, but the game is so much of a random mish-mash now that there is really no thought to it.
---
On top of the community being toxic and way too young, of course.
---
Not really the splicer symbol. This IS the SIVA symbol, its been seen on Exodus Black concept art. But the way its been drawn, are most likely Splicers.

Thanks for doing this I needed this today and this is literally getting me to go on and play some D2 now, thanks.

FRICK I DIDN'T NOTICE IT IN D1 EITHER
---
Grandma and her tonic can stay for anything PVE related. But that shit has to go for PVP unless it gets its own playlist.
---
Yeah this isn't correct. Check out Coolguy's YouTube review of the weapon and read his pinned comment going into detail about this. You can always pull copies from collections to test other mods then dismantle to save the mod and get your cores back. I have one with CB and one with icarus and personally favor the CB, ironically even in air

Where was the scream that he does when you shut down someone‚Äôs super with your own?

It gives me life

YESSSS

Wait a minute

Lol the ramen - do they give you choices or is that custom?
---
This is just my opinion but I would do curse of osiris and warmind. Otherwise like you said it leaves holes in the story. There worth playing but it's up to you. If I had ps4 I'd help out but I'm on xbox.
---
I could say the same thing about his clothing options
---
U can choose
---
Our definition of normal player is almost certainly different. I am not talking about people who can see 1kd from where they are at. The easy kills in qp. The people that get punished every game they play outside of IB .
---
 And I totally play IB to win. At my level, it's the only game mode where my play can determine the outcome of the game. Games are close and competative at my sub normal level.

These are the four I‚Äôm going for, funnily enough. I‚Äôm close. Want Chronicler to be my first. Lore means a lot to me.

take exactly what you just said and apply it to your own logic just as you are trying to apply it to my assumption... 
---
you literally just contradicting yourself the entire time and blame me for being wrong with the exact type of reason you yourself are tryin to provide.. yet you somehow think it means youre correct if you say it..
---
and everyone since you now claim everyone is you and your titans friends.
---
also cammycakes has said things about this numerous times.. hes even said running a female in pvp has clear advantages.. a lot of people regard cammy as the bets pvp player in the world actually.. you once again you have zero clue what youre talking about.
---
educate yourself, do your research and dont just claim i can just google it to find out lmao!
---
you provide zero hard proof to support anything the said NONE! yet you critique for me throwing out concepts and making assumptions for the topic of conversation yet thats exactly the thing youre doing while providing me literally NOTHING that hold weight...
---
everything you said is hearsay and bullshit you might as well be fabricated shit out of the air and deeming it true 
---
so use your own logic against yourself.. you cant critique me for my own logic and assumptions when if applied to you in the same light its just as weightless.. dont pull the same card on me if when you apply it to yourself you cant back it up either... and you cant 
---
you also in one statement said this isnt an issue but in another say it has been an issue in the past but they fixed it???? smh
---
you proof is you literally telling me to google it! lmao
---
you say anyone with an iq would know the difference well.. this whole sub and you and all youre buddies must be way below average. no wonder i top frag every game.. this is what i play against lmao.
---
ill let you bask in all this hollow delusional assumption that hold zero weight.. its literally not worth the time. ill stick to my community that are cognizant enough to know somethings fishy rather than attempt to bring others up to standard and realizing and underlying issue with the game.. your brains clearly only follow the weightless unproven herd assumption...

Also have a 9 month old baby so can't raid with randos right now as its not fair on them if I suddenly have dash or be unable to make call outs because im whispering :)
---
can i pay you to have make me one too? I cant afford a printer so i cant do this myself. This is my favorite exotic weapon...
---
So you want "No Land Beyond" is what your saying
---
Antaeus wards are a beautiful thing.
---
Wow Blood Cleaver on Titan for the third week in a row. Shocking.
---
I had the No Land Beyond and it was a fun exotic cause you could run 2 Snipers but I wasn‚Äôt very good with it
---
BUT I WANTED MUH EDZ FLASHPOINT /s
---
I didn't even know this game came out
---
Yeah YouTube is how I learned lol I am really thinking of getting back into it. Would you suggest just learning AE now or continuing with Sony Vegas?
---
Bring me his arm, I want to mount it on my wall
---
Wait
---
ptew ptew ptew ptew fwoosh
---
I hope this isn't the end of SIVA, I hope that there's more.
---
Try again in 20
---
No Land Beyond was my baby in D1. I rolled people in the crucible with it combined with the wrath of the machine fusion rifle (I don‚Äôt remember the name, I think it was Ether Nova). I was unstoppable. I haven‚Äôt felt the same in crucible since then.
---
Does it say how to get the catalyst?
---
And not a single Gambit Prime, I just go there to get green gear and then back to high school gambit.
---
I'm not trying to be a dick, you really did a good job, I would just try and figure out something for it ya know?
---
yes
---
a heroic version of the mission opens up after you get the gun just like whisper
---
From what I'm seeing, some players are showing it's on EDZ, while others are showing Titan. [https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/blt773/d2\_weekly\_reset\_thread\_20190507/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/blt773/d2_weekly_reset_thread_20190507/)
---
It has been finished.
---
5k viewers ain‚Äôt much to brag about tho
---
They‚Äôre actually the eververse revelry pieces! Except the mask, i could only use the ornament with the normal revelry mask. Also the grips are tangled web grips. I put the Bergusia shader with it and not gonna lie it looks pretty good with the gold :)
---
Oh dear lol
---
/s?
---
I felt that, but I just got back into the game so every content after base game is new content. Oopsie there goes my life between this game and final projects and exams!!
---
I wonder if people with DLC have Titan, and people without have EDZ? I had thought this quest was the free one available to all players, but seeing the quest steps in /r/raidsecrets, it may be Forsaken only.
---
I actually had to SCROLL to get to this, HOW DARE YOU!?
---
Just kidding, thank you for doing the due diligence I could never have the patience to do üòÅ
---
Give it to me.
---
seriously though, dragonfly and rampage?  unless you can't hit any precision shots its a great roll.  At least that's what I hear from my friend who has it as I have yet to get it to drop after like 12 powerful frames or so....maybe this week?
---
No problem bro.
---
Get that fucking pulse rifle :D
---
Unsure if you‚Äôve figured it out, but for future people I‚Äôm 99% sure you need to have done the Titan quest to get the Rat King quest, and it has to be done on the character you use. My friend and I couldn‚Äôt open the door, we completed the quest in like 30 minutes, door unlocked.
---
I done it with a friend, I know I done it right because he got the transponder while standing next to me, but I didn't.  
---
So I done it on my other 2 solo to double check they weren't the one I done the Rat king on. Then again I done it on all 3 solo to double check everything, I cannot unlock the door on any of my toons, and I have rat king done.
---
No reason for these downvotes, you‚Äôre exactly correct
---
&gt;all d2 players
---
Sure, as long as you can kill the 690 boss at the end, lol.
---
Guys please help, someone yeeted my wifi and I can't do this today. Will the heroic adventure pop up again this week?
---
I thought destiny had rough releases..
---
Ok? You forgot the shitpost flair
---
Damn. I don't know what to do. 
---
Try tweeting Bungie help or posting in r/raidsecrets or in the megathread for r/destinythegame. You may encounter people with a similar plight and might see how to fix your issue.
---
I hope it gets fixed tho. The pulse rifle looks really awesome
---
Anthem‚Äôs beta was sooooo bad I actually cancelled my order (even downloaded it on xbox and pc so see if one was better, both jars as bad.)
---
Waiting for it to go free to play.
---
You need to save the fallen captain in order to get the door open
---
Ok so i just did the enemy is my enemy quest chain and let the mithrax dude go before i got the reactor in the third quest. My door was locked before went back and was able to get in and get the transponder.
---
Thanks, I was looking forward for something to do in Destiny this week also. 
---
Thank you for trying to help, I'll just jump back on Path of Exile till next Tuesday! :)
---
Have fun bro! Look forward to seeing you next week
---
Preach
---
that's what i just did. I've had the eome mission up for a while.
---
Yes I don‚Äôt have to complete my quest on d1 to use this beauty!
---
You have to have it done on the same character. Mission progress is by character, so if you got Rat King on another character, you still need to do Enemy of my Enemy for this character.
---
Can confirm. My friend and I couldn‚Äôt unlock it, we did the questline (and only did the questline), and could open it.
---
Thank you kind stranger!
---
Gotta either wait for the flashpoint or do it on a fresh character as triumphs are account based. Good news? It's not keeping you from something more substantial like the wayfarer seal itself. But I understand your frustration (as someone who farmed for all the variks lore)
---
Flashpoint is on Titan mate.
