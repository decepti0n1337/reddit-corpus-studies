[Their turbocheap build will smoke Destiny 2 and is $540, so similar cost to a PS4 setup.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PCMasterRace/wiki/builds)

---
thanks! hopefully it'll still remain useful. I usually pace my shots a little to make sure I'm landing those headshots, but if it's just going to be like any other 150rpm HC then I'll be better off using better devils or something along those lines.
---
She's gonna cry when she sees this
---
Still an actual nerf to a pinnacle weapon. And the 150 change is probably the biggest part of it. 180’s are laser beams compared to the kick of a 150.
---
What are the two handcannons on the right side
---
Haha thanks! Its definitely maddening but I really want that triumph haha, so I’ll keep trying tonight
---
Congrats dude, really good job :D

This has restored my faith in humanity

Thank you so much! Super glad to hear that. Had to crunch it out cause it was real close to OP's birthday and I wasn't done haha.

Whether we wanted it or not, we stepped into a war with the hive on saturn

That's just a skill gap, not a weapon taking skill.

---
Seriously though, I hope they leave the recoil alone and just change the RoF, especially for console players
---
No I got that part, the rage for me was the hit box for shooting the gun out of his hand, so to speak. Hit box felt ridiculous.
---
As a warlock main I understand the truth of rule #7.
---
I doubt they will. They seem to want to make triggering Magnificent Howl harder, but make it easier to finish off the kill by upping the body shot damage. HC recoil on console sucks in general.
---
God that last one is the WORST
---
Upvoting every thread i see because this is fucking bullshit
---
Finish forsaken and then unlock the dreaming city. I believe after that you should be able to go to the drifter and do a few of his special bounties that will bump you up to 650. I'm not sure if you need the season pass for the bounties though.
---
Absolute fucking retardation
---
You should have an Awoken Talisman or something along those lines. It’s a quest, complete it if you wanna reach endgame.
---
As long as you hit 5500 Glory points this season you will complete the quest for NF as soon as you get all the kills required.
---
This is a fucking garbage change that ruins the identity of the weapons.
---
Really wish the answer was out there.  Materials completely changed for me today at 5pm pdt despite  reset counter starting 17 hours till next reset.
---
They’ll still be good trophies I guess
---
I feel like either of the other classes would have popped that super the second they heard the door open.
---
This is a ghost shell, with a few engrams being sold at 1000 silver. THATS $10 AUD.
---

---
10. DOLLARS.
---
For a god damn shell. I mean sure, it looks nice and you're getting a few engrams, but TEN. FUCKING. DOLLARS for a Ghost Shell, which **DOESN'T EVEN HAVE GUIDING LIGHT** is NOT okay.
---
I do NOT want to pay $10 for it's easter aesthetics. I don't want to pay for it's god awful perk that nearly EVERY exotic shell that you can get for just playing has.
---
NO one wants to pay $10 to get another god damn blue engram everytime they do something.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
How has it that Bungie is selling out harder than ever? THIS IS FUCKING STUPID AND UNACCEPTABLE
---
Feel free to offer other alternatives/suggestions in the comments
---
Thanks alot.
---
*"Buffing universal HC Consistency/ adjusting flinch on console might've been a better option."*
---
Hes not wrong .
---
Yes, you are, in several of your points. 
---
&gt;Comp used to be easy, not even desirable before these guns came out to be honest. 
---
Maybe because before these guns comp was completely useless? Because there was no reason to play comp because Trials existed? 
---
&gt;Screwing the entire 180rpm handcannon class is especially overkill
---
180s aren't being nerfed in any way.
---
&gt;Most of the community doesn’t say anything and the changes you make has always been due to you , bungie, folding to its constant negative side of the community. 
---
Most of the community doesn't say anything, because most of the community is made up of players that don't care about optimal time to kill or which guns are currently meta. Most of the community is perfectly happy blowing heads of aliens and occasionally other players. 
---
The people that complained about Luna/NF were people that do care ablut these things.
---
&gt;A feeling of “I wasted my time” will wash over destiny’s player base. Nerfing Luna’s Howl and Not Forgotten, I promise, will be the beginning death throws for destiny 2. This isn’t a game for everyone, you need to realize that. Giving people a mountain to climb gives you more notoriety, not less. Look at FromSoftware.
---
No it won't be the death throes (not throws, no one is throwing death around) and I all but guarantee that I am going to see most of the people raging now in Season of Oppulence and whatever is after. 
---
Also Really comparing Destiny 2 with FromSoft games is not only buying into a marketing campaign FromSoft themselves dislike but also shows a complete lack of understanding what makes their games difficult and obvious differences between genres.

150s also kill in three headshots so you won’t need the perk to three tap

Are you just going to ignore the 8 billion other posts that have already been made about this subject?

good point!
---
Do you advocate for a nerf for Luna’s howl and NF?
---
Hvnt seen tham
---
If you want just to up your light quick, Drifter offers 4 bounties that will give you a 640 rate (blue) gear for each equippable slot). That's assuming that you're at max level of 50. After that it's just going around doing the various activities to score better gear.

I know man, I know.

I wonder how many people bitched about this weapon?
---
Yea I mean I guess 150s I’m wondering how it’s gonna handle though since it’s gonna be precision frame
---
I just for Legend for the first time last week.  All that hard work finally paid off and it felt great to finally achieve that goal.  This actually feels really bad to hear, and personally past 3k every game had 1-4 enemy NF users, and I still won against them while using Ace of Spades because its an insanely powerful handcannon and can duel Not Forgotten all day.  That being said I jokingly told my friend “watch it get nerfed right after I get it.”   Massive oof.
---
I'm just in this for Luna and Recluse.
---
Luna maybe for PVP. Or maybe just as a general hc.
---
Recluse for both PVP and PVE, but primarily PVE.
---
Use the Bungie Destiny 2 app, select the "fireteam" tab and post what you're looking for. People are usually quick to respond.
---
Dude hell yea I’ll sell destiny 2 and buy silver with the money I made anyday
---
Literally
---
Forgive my stupidity but you're referring to mk44 right?
---
For me it's hand cannons because of high damage per shot
---
Same, I just wish that I could play an indefinite campaign instead of being forced to fight the avatar project or whatever.

Crucible is still open to you, just not iron banner. As far as I’m aware iron banner is the only PvP mode affected by power level
---
I agree with only one of them that’s always to remember cayde other then QUIT USING A DAMN CRUTCH SUPER
---
Only iron banner has light level advantages on
---
Just see it this way:
---
If I take a 180 RPM Service Revolver, and you take a Luna's Howl, and we shoot each other, ***headshots only*** \- at the exact same time - why do you deserve to win? Do I have less skill than you? 
---
Or is it just that your gun's perk gave you your kill faster than mine was allowed to, despite us both playing identically.
---
**THAT** is the problem with Lunas. It breaks the rule on it's archetype.
---
I believe the word you’re looking for is “easy”, but I mean I’m just telling you how the wind blows
---
Props to you for getting NF man!
---
I just kinda wanted more variety in crucible so that’s why I think this change is good, sorry if I sounded like a whiny baby
---
The ogres have invaded the sub. This can only mean one thing.
---
It’s all ogre now
---
It definitely doesn’t.
---
Because these are primaries that delete supers, balance should come first, which is rich considering hunters and warlocks, well, exist, but that should be the philosophy
---
Good bot
---
You better marry that woman. She loves the fuck outta you.
---
Variety is good, but nerfing something to make others better is not good, it’s why I stopped trials in D1, first year was thorn and TLW, next was every 2-3 months a new meta that was going to get nerfed eventually.
---
I’d be okay if they took away the magnificent howl on body shots. Stricter skill makes sense.
---
Not nerfing it out of the game essentially though. That’s just catering to players bitching about the gun.
---
You're comparing a 400 hundred dollar TV to a 90 bucks monitor. Are you serious? . 
---
It should be zero for a TV because they already have one. Besides, you can get a 4k 50" TV for like $250 from Walmart. The whole crux of your price comparison is based on this which is pointless. He also currently has a console, ergo the cost to him is currently zero vs the 800 dollar investment. The only way you can justify PC vs console is with the price of an expensive TV? I've played hundreds of hours of fifa/CoD on a TV that cost £100 You've said you can buy expensive TVs therefore PC gaming and console gaming is equivalent price. It's a non sequiture. 
---
I'm not sure if you're intentionally missing the point or not. You're also not pulling up the same standard even if for some reason he had no TV at home. That IPS panel is total garbage and you've tried to swing it the other way to a mid range TV. 
---
You've also assumed they have the competence or inclination to build it. If you don't, the price goes way up. PC gaming is more expensive than consoles. Period.
---
It needed a nerf, but nothing like what Bungie is doing. It was just too easy to use before, and gave too much of a reward, even in the hands of a low skill player. Unlike Redrix, Lunas and NF encouraged paid carries and other toxic behavior because anyone who got them could see an almost instant rise in their K/D no matter how good they were before. This is all from a console players perspective.
---
Curse of Osiris had to have been one of the most pathetic, money grubbing, absolutely god awful DLC I had ever bought. I bought the season pass on launch and dear god it was the biggest mistake I made. Dropped destiny after like three weeks of CoO and only picked it up this December.
---
Finally, appreciation for the best handcannon in the game
---
Hunter just pisses me off as a class they aren’t useful only in raids and they are just too damn squishy
---
Sick! She’s a keeper!!! I can’t even imagine the smile on your face when you got it! :D

On a side note: I hope she put her signature on it somewhere :/

I don’t think anyone has ever successfully shot down an entire nova bomb in PvP.  If you shoot down the big one, it breaks into a bunch of smaller seekers too.

can we have gun?

we already have gun
---

Ok, how?
---
Still think the nerf to go is to make them arc damage so then the player can go Riskrunner as a hard counter but whatever

is this like a shop or something?

I think it’s like the NF emblems that you acquire. You should be able to choose it from the Gambit Emblem (can’t remember which one) once equipped.

I’m Glad bungie doesn’t cater to people like

It's an emblem variant. Just like Nightfall emblems.

---
I did some artwork for some people in my clan and literally wrote 'WATERMARK' across the middle of it with like 70% Opacity until i got paid lol. Art is just one of those things people don't want to pay for, but it takes a lot of time and talent.
---
Be careful not to use it in close quarters, walls and the ground have blocked it for me lately, especially in verdent forest runs where the turns are tight, not an expert here just a couple things I've noticed
---
I'm on PC and Ace, Last Word are dominant. You see a NF or Luna here and there but it isn't that prevalent. I have Luna's but I've been using a Spare Rations and been able to compete effectively even with Iron Burden active. Bungie really dicked the console player base with how they did hand cannons and they are taking the wrong path about this.
---
I like how it’s a meme but totally spot on/
---
War = Last word (characterized by it’s wielder, Shin Malfur’s personal war on fallen guardians)
---
Conquest = Ace (a voracious chain killer only getting stronger and harder to stop with each kill)
---
Famine = Thorn (literally drains the life out of you slowly)
---
Death = Malfeasance (otherworldly, unrelenting and unrivaled in damage potential)
---
They updated it to count the step if you did 5 resets in any one season. Need  not be the current one.
---
I'll take the burn dmg
---
not really, especially with the aim assist the game already has
---
Anywhere from 15-20, good games 30-40. I use Chaperone + NF + Hammerhead. Some games are horrible, typically when I'm matching Mountaintop / Recluse users at 700 LL.
---
Lol if only you had a web browser on your phone you could solve this great mystery. Dumbshit.
---
that is what he is saying.
---
Honestly, playing slow and play around your team mates. Try to grab clean up kills, don't peak first almost ever. Check the entire lobby and try to get under everyones LL incase they're 1/2 LL below you (because if they're even 1 LL above you, you don't get progress off killing them sadly). It's a really flawed system now that people are dropping to around 580/570 making it really brutal to get actual progress.
---
All but Reckoner, have the sets just havent had time to finish it off yet. Especially with dumping all my time lately into Iron Banner and hopping on CSGO.
---
Fuck the bullshit tbh. Im just not playing pvp for shit i already hit 700 with a shit ton of 700 items anyways. Cause fuck dealing with constant skip grenades eating at my ass while im trying to gun someone down.
---
That's XCOM baby!
---
Given the trend with most devs lately there seems to be a growing amount of proof that there isn't much brain matter between any of them. There's a difference between making something fun and just making things worse. I'd take the hard road to get whatever there is worth getting even if there was some easier way to go about. Unless time was short anyway. It's just these people that do it to such an extent that it's just a headache. Haven't been in comp since this event started and for the sake of my sanity I'm not going in till it's over.
---
This, you can generally see a Taken boop coming, but a phalanx melee? Yeeted across the map into your own invasion portal.
---
Not as easy as just point and click on PC.
---
I tried it and couldn't believe how easy it was on PC!
---
blade barrage too
---
Why the fuck would they make them 150? This just again shows bungie doesn’t ever play pvp.
---
Season pass is needed for the special bounties.
---
Fuck the captain hadoukens tbh. They need to tone down its use. I swear they can shoot that shit back to back and never use their weapon.
---
They should have fixed other rpm hc's on conosle cause on pc luna/nf are no problem to deal with and aren't used by everyone. But now no one will use them anymore and they also lost any use in pve
---
“how does killing more easily raise the skill bar? And honestly all metas are good for the first month or 2, we're more than half a year into this one”
---
-Getting killed by a three tap raises the skill bar. If you keep getting killed from three taps. Then you’re doing something wrong.
---
“same with any other gun”
---
Hand cannons require precision per shot. Inside a range that most primary guns have to abide by. Handcannons do take the most skill to use.
---
“(no, they did the community a disservice by making people "salty" "toxic" and "outright quit playing")”
---
No. Getting Luna’s Howl and NF was hard for many. I guarantee they got better. To assume any game came players who didn’t get  ““salty””, ““toxic””, or “”outright quit playing”” is adolescent and naive.
---
Luna’s Howl/NF did not make pvp easier by any means. That’s a good thing. It means bungie was finally critiquing their own game. You know, until people complained. You know, the ones that are “”salty””, “”toxic””, and “”outright quit playing””.
---
“”uh yeah we're just fat nerds chatting shit on the internet, glad you're honest too””
---
Weird flex, but okay.
---
Hell yeah!
---
My new gf
---
It's the wayfarer title; Wanderer is german
---
Marry her
---
Take away the magnificent howl body shot. That’s all I’d change.
---
Imo, what they should do is make Mag Howl a debuff (remove 2 tapping) and that would fix most of it. LH is stupid easy to get now with the comp glory changes.  If mag howl only worked on one target and couldn’t be procced on one and used on another, that annoying bit would go away.  And possibly make it a bit more difficult to use because of changes to reload speed or alter the stability a touch.  Making it require you to miss shots will just cause Ace to takes it place.
---
Luna’s has been in my vault for a while now. It, along with all hand cannons, just doesn’t wreck enough in pvp to replace some of the pulse rifles I have. Maybe I’ll take it out for some PvE this weekend.
---
How do you do that?
---
I will likely never get a Luna's howl and I will certainly never achieve a not forgotten, and I don't think they should touch these guns.
---
Do I hate running up against them?  Of course. But the whole point of getting them is how much better they are as pvp weapons.
---
Bungie makes monumentally bad decisions with nerfs and buffs, as a rule, not as an exception.
---
Sadly that doesn't work with War of the chosen so they miss out on 3 classes,new enemies,new gear and new mechanics
---
there is no matchmaking
---
The implications of this "nerf" go far beyond the guns themselves. Look at it this way. Why will a pve player or an average pvp player, go out of their way to grind competitive for a gun that will be outperform by a strike drop? "Service Revolver". We lost trials, now lost the pinnacle weapons from comp, imagine Lunas lack of range with 150RPM. Unless they announce trials is coming back or new "Great" pinnacle competitive weapon, specially for Legend rank! Why play competitive? This is not looking good for the pvp community... then they said "coming from playtests, they still feel to be the 'pinnacle' legendary Hand Cannons for D2" this is coming from the same people who tested the unlimited nade spam 😐. "F"
---
Better than Luna+Dust
---
Let’s see how good you’re without your precious pistol lol (I have the weapon btw)
---
They changed the perk to remove the ability to two tap. And yes good players will win still but now they will have to win purely based on skill rather than weapons
---
It's 2 bloody guns, just pick another weapon, it's not the end of pvp, lmao.
---
Where is that screen taken from?
---
I assume that they do have a sbmm. Everything else would be supremely stupid. They just have decided that they want to favour shorter queueing times over match balance, which is their design decision.
---
No the fact you don’t understand some of the outrage tells me you haven’t used them lol
---
... except your rank resets every season, so then what?
---
they aren't victims. they are getting exactly what they paid for. buyers remorse.
---
And Osiris butt mouse pad
---
Luna’s/NF we can talk about them all day but we do have to say that 180 rpm hand cannons are just to damn strong in the crucible. Don’t get me wrong I love my Luna’s, it’s the monster I thought it first was when shaxx gave it to me. The gun is supposed to give us a reward for hitting precision shots.but let’s be real, 180s don’t have recoil what’s so ever.
---
Im mainly PVE too. Really want recluse. 
---
Fatebringer was awesome
---
Yeah it’s something in Disney
---
Yeah
---
I remember when Gambit Prime first came out the same time QB got the nerf. It was f-king glorious to actually go toe to toe with invaders at mid-range.
---
I might actually play Crucible now because of this...BUT I do wish they would just buff the other weapon types instead of nerfing 2 hand cannons though. Autos still don't do enough DPS even in PvE imo.
---
If you ask me, I am disgusted by the new nerf for LH and NF, If bungie goes through with the nerf, then they have to make the quest shorter, like two-three of the original steps, if it doesn’t have the same stopping power, then why bother doing a full quest
---
I'm trying to get wayfarer right now and every time I open a chest to find no radiolarian culture I wonder why bungie ever thought CoO was a good idea
---
Yeah i don’t want to turn into one of those super salty players, but it seems insane to nerf a pinnacle weapon that can take up to a hundred hours to get for an average player. Maybe it’s not that much, but it certainly felt that way to me because of shitty matchmaking, dcs, etc. It’s going to be very hard to get into comp next season knowing that your efforts will be stripped away the minute whiners get mad about you killing them in QP.
---
"Nf and lunas are extremely hard to use well as is"
---
They're literally the easiest hand cannons in the game to use, at least on console.  They're brainless.  Luna's maybe takes a bit more positioning skill because of its sucky range, but NF is easy mode.
---
There are games where it can absolutely take dozens or hundreds of hours to level a class and get it to the point that it is end game ready.  Only to see it nerfed into trash tier come patch day.  Not just a weapon, but an entire class.
---
It's an MMO.  They evolve.  Things you worked for this year might be useless in the next patch.  I'm a little surprised they haven't been surpassed in effectiveness by new weapons already.
---
Holy Shit!
---
I just worked like hell to get Lunas, and OF COURSE, they go and do this crap!
---
Id rather not be playing chicken with someone because they're gun is statistically better
---
Too
---
isnt the time to obtain the quest over?
---
As I said is not about perks anymore, those guns feel weird to wield, I liked the more gunlike feeling of D1 weapons, if you know what I mean, we had “fantasy weapons” in oryx but I just want my metal shooters back, Service Revolver kind looks like tin made in terms of sound/weight.
---
Ah Cris de Tabarnak.... 😉😂
---
You read it incorrectly.
---
Luna and NF will take on all aspects of 150s but will be the only precision frame 150s and retain the animations and recoil of 180s.
---
Considering the Higher Damage of 150s the nerf to Magnificent Howl seems designed to prevent the formerly rare occurrence of two taps to become a problem in the future.
---
EP sniper nerfed so that the perks don’t even work with each other
---
But it would only be sweaty for those who legitimately try and probably only play crucible? Are you telling me you like steam roll a team because they’re inexperienced or have a match that makes you play to your best but without any lose or rank or glory. If you’re in the low ranks you won’t be paired against players who aren’t on ranks way higher that’s yours. Personally I’d rather just see a return is trials so pvp player have some end game besides raids and qp
---
If you take away all Bloom then the only thing that becomes playable is HC in the crucible.
---
i‘m just sad that they nerfed a pinnacle hand cannon so hard it can‘t reach the ttk a fucking vanguard hand cannon with the same frame can reach
---
Happy cake day dude
---
There's no risk/reward. Only reward. Useless to make a gun that's literally just better in any conceivable way to a regular version. They should be side grades that take into account the difficulty that comes with getting them, to where they require a certain finesse like with redrix
---
nice
---
Me and my clanthe other day did this exactly we all ran only rat king and while it was fun you definitely can’t win many fights unless you’re all together.
---
Apex?
---
Yeah like most AAA games there are more people on console than PC....
---
Which one is NF?
---
MagHowl works exactly the same. The only change us that it wont work from one guardian to the next.
---
Im not super good at comp, and im a few days from getting my lunas, and this pisses me off.
---
That's assuming you can get kill clip on service. Which means service could be better in qp, while lh/nf would be better in comp because groups know not to push when someone has kill clip. Lh will still be a top tier 1v1 weapon
---
thing is Luna and NF can be counter but machine gun? you can't you anything when you get hit by it you'll go blind temporary and flickering like hell.
---
How does it show up in the triumphs page? It’s not there for me
---
But that's taking into account comp rank in qp. But yes trials would fix a lot of this
---
I don‘t think that it‘s time gated, talk to the drifter. maybe you already have it. the cleansing is the name of the quest iirc
---
Nope
---
It’s not the same archetype though (I’m thinking weapons like Ballyhoo (D2), or Imago Loop(D1)). I get what you mean, but IMO is just another trust.
---
In comp, your team will get the heavy if you perform better when you don't have it.
---
Even if the enemy pulls an hmg, you can always use a special to instantly get rid of it of you play tactically
---
But I can guarantee not everyone that uses them are good. I see a lot of good players who have NF who don’t use them because they said they don’t like them and it doesn’t fit them. It’s only because other handcannons are so underwhelming that they’re both so popular. Handcannons are very much a higher skill weapon. Obviously snipers neededto be looked at and I’m glad they’re getting the change regarding supers. Just imo it’s not that Lunas and NF are op it’s just other weapons aren’t as good. There are a that are okay, trust, ikelos, kindled orchid for some and so on.
---
that for sure but is it worth for new people to spend time in comp? I don‘t think so. maybe reckuse until it gets nerfed
---
No it doesn’t. It used to be the next shot would deal extra damage now it’s only body shots deal the extra damage.
---
Sturm, no doubt. 
---
buuut if we're including ornaments, the Last Word with the Laconic ornament. God, I love that thing to death.
---
- Dreaded Venture
---
- Ace of Spades
---
- Two-tailed fox (with ornament only)
---
I just got my LH so this is how I feel:
---
1-this sucks, I just got it so after months of getting killed by it and wanting my revenge they nerf it
---
2-if they don’t change the crucible meta crucible will just stay the same toxic and boring meta we are currently in
---
Tough talk from a titan who just banner shielded your blade barrage
---
Didn't they reduce the damage output of all machine guns by 21 percent?...
---
because Console ppl wanted justice.
---
Hucleberry with the black ornament or chaperone with the black. Legendary lunas or cremils dagger.
---
I was so confused by that. Like are they retiring or not? Will we just get a couple of specials a year instead of a 13 episode season? I totally understand if they want to retire, James and Jezza (esp Jezza) are starting to get old and it doesn't look like an easy job.
---
CET Central Europe time right? If so thats good cause I am from Switzerland add me on Bnet Brocolini#21871
---
Yup. Just got mine two days ago and was feeling better about the grind for NF. Nevrmind that now
---
Like the ones from the soar boys or just thumbnails, just the few clips in beginning of kruzers alone as a god vid on midtown, so clean
---
Exactly. The problem is that on console the handcannons can’t consistently do well. That’s one of the reasons Luna’s and n/f are overpowered. But people think it is just because of Luna’s and nf and not all handcannons.
---
Arc buddy is great!
---
From my “farming xp” - I’m like 10 hrs in and got 5, one even had rapid fire and multi kill clip but I’m going for swashbuckler with rapid hit.
---
All of the guns dropped from T2. Sometimes I haven’t had a single drop for 1hr or even 2!
---
That is editing after the fact
---
ya a grenade that takes out a whole super? so godly
---
Pretty good crossover meme
---
I feel like people don't understand the changes to these guns. Bungie doesn't want a gun that thrives in neutral play. They require TWO headshots to get their pinnacle perk as opposed to redrix and recluse requiring a kill. These changes are perfect in my eyes. They reward precision still but not as much to make you OP, and they are being moved to an RPM that increases the chemistry between the gun and the perk.
---
On console it’s still going to be viable, more so than ace
---
Mark Ruffalo had to have a blast filming those scenes lol
---
Exactly. They are much easier to use than any other handcannon, and are more consistent, which is why everyone uses them. So make handcannons other than 180s good on console and it will fix the problem
---
No lol. People love to complain but this is the most balanced crucible has ever been.
---
Man this makes me sad. I’m at 1800 comp points and I was excited to get Lunas 😔😔
---
That what I have been saying for ages the maps are way to small for 6x6 and it bothered me so much when the made it exclusively that
---
what nerf to NF and LH?
---
OOTL
---
It's not punishment dude xD do you even play pc? Ace is exotic, it forces you to choose between it and something like coil. Ace rewards you for kills, luna is getting nerfed as you don't even need a kill to increase its damage.
---
Do you have any tips to solo it? (Im a warlock main)
---
Not really, the best Editor couldnt do smth that clean with some of the screenshots i took, they looked like - 144p
---
Liar's Handshake: *Am I a joke to you?*
---
Darth Vader is lukes dad
---
I thought the changes weren’t gonna go live til season of opulence
---
Fuck me this made me laugh a bit too much. 
---
While I don't have Not Forgotten, I have every other pinnacle weapon. I was going to go for it this season, but now I'm unsure. 
---
I think its bullshit.
---
*sythnoceps intensifies*
---
Mate, that gun was running rampant. I never end up getting it. But god damn me if it wasn't in every second PvP game I played. That thing needed a nerf, most guns I used couldn't beat someone with it even if I shot first. These aren't fair fights. I didn't do the math on how quickly it kills. But it was faster than most other guns out there making it op. Everyone should have a chance in PvP, why should you be forced to get this gun just to stand a chance. It's not fun to be put at a disadvantage.
---
Why fusion? Clearly they gonna buff spectral blades.
---
and Bungie still wanted to fix Luna and NF but not this.
---
I've never understood the point of grinding for an awesome weapon only for Bungie to nerf it because their player base found a way to increase its effectiveness by using an exotic armor piece and an ability a guardian would have.
---
You can certainly try trading losses for kills, most people would probably agree to let you do it in exchange for a win for them. And since you're in a four stack you're not hurting blueberries. I have had people message me and ask, unfortunately we were on a 3 streak and only needed one more win for fabled so we had to say no, but I would do it now for sure.
---
lol great gif but the reason people are upset is because there's a better way to handle it rather then Nerfing something people worked hard to obtain. fact is Bloom is an issue on console and needs to be addressed.
---
that being said your right theres other guns
---
like service revolver that does the exact same thing as lunas but with more range.
---
see you in the crucible
---
So this guy is a pvp and pve god
---
On console maybe. It’s kind’ve dumb that they nerfed the lethality of LH and NF when the reason that they are used on console is because they have aim assist that defies physics and ignores the ranges they should be used at. The fact that people use other 180s like trust and service revolver completely shows this as they have garbage ttks.
---
Play in 4k, everything looks good in 4k.
---
That's all you get for a raid too, don't understand where that logic came from.
---
Magnificent Howl definitely needed a nerf.
---
I said wire wool
---
Boooooo, I want BETTERFASTERSTRONGER!
---
*TOP TREE ARCSTRIDER INTENSIFIES*
---
I come across this complaint sometimes but I don't understand it, are you pc? My smugglers word is a GD beast in pve with full auto/rampage but I'm ps4
---
**NYEHHHHHHH!**
---
But even if other archetypes become easier to use lunas/nf would still kill faster and have an easier recoil pattern to manage. In a lot of ways they’re just better than every other hc or any weapon type really
---
“Rewarded skill” ??? Hitting hs’s isn’t hard at all. There’s no skill in that
---
I was almost to 4000 solo queuing. Then the revelry happened. Now this shit. I think... just fuck it man.
---
It was so fun to hear about this because I literally just got LH a week ago
---
I used hunter to solo it, but I have some helpful tips for warlock. Riskrunner or huckleberry will help a lot for ads. Use your healing rift on boss fights. And definitely use those revelry buffs for spamming grenades. And you might want to run well of radiance along with it. If you have sleeper sim or whisper of the worm, it’s very easy.
---
Why? Because it’s at #83?
---
you're wrong but ok
---
More precise =/= easier to aim with, and aim assist is way too strong. I started playing d2 on console (i played d1 too), the. i got a pc with forsaken. Let me tell you that after getting used to playing with a mouse, which was a steep learning curve of itself, i am completely shit when i revisit other games i was good at when I was playing on a console. Not destiny 2 tho, no I can go 30-0 on destiny 2 with a controller, that's better than I am on pc (barely positive kd). The aim assist is too much. Removing bloom on consoles would break the game.
---
How good you are at war I suppose.

AA is that strong, it seems like you're really underestimating how large the AA region is
---
Nothing for our Striders and former Bladedancers?
---
I have the gun and  im glad its going to be nerfed bc im tired of only seeing lunas or nf everywhere in the crucible im ready for new guns to be used and you guys are complaining that its just the people who suck who got it nerfed but i can bet that the data they have on the weapon is just as big or a even bigger reason they nerfed it
---
No instead you come on the internet to rant about people ranting. Again seems a bit hypocritical if you ask me.
---
Aim assist has different values for different guns, and some guns do have 100% aim assist like MIDA. As in, you can hold the stick motionless and it’ll track the enemy exactly where you leave your crosshair.
---
Caption could also read Jotunn, especially with all the hate towards it. Personally i think the need to buff Jotunns power and make it a power weapon.
---
Plenty of things to chase. Assuming you have annual pass, open up those forges and try to get Jotunn or Le Monarque. Get into Gambit Prime and go for 21% Delirium. Those three are my favorite weapons right now. Revelry is fun, Reckoning is fun, I stay away from crucible personally but if you end up liking it, those pinnacle weapons can be fun to chase, I guess. Take a look at Seals for long term things to chase.
---
I feel like knocking it down to 150 but keeping the howl the same would have been good enough.  A 110 that two taps with super high range would probably be complained about more than they are currently.
---
And an "art" style t shirt of Osiris
---
You know what type I'm talking about
---
I got it when I had 2 more to go
---
Why Nerf them, when you can buff things instead
---
I never get tired of this comment lol
---
"I'm using a shitty app therefor you're a dumbshit"
---
k.
---
I agree that luna/nf should not be nerfed, there are plenty of ways to compete with them and tbh it’s a slap in the face to the people that worked hard to get them. However jotunn is not op lol I see people complain about it all the time it’s just like any other fusion... actually worse because of the projectile speed it allows you to react to it after it’s been shot unlike other fusions
---
I thought destiny 2 stated they wanted to stray away from nerfing things earlier in the year
---
Love cammys content enjoy his streams but he is ridiculously tone Def when it comes to the over powered nature of many weapons.
---
His argument always boils down to him and his clan mates can strap on other weapons and do extremely well. This is all well and good but him and his team mates are all amazing players
---
It's akin to a millionaire telling a homeless guy "just buy a house"
---
In IB, I would say that is not very true. At least at below average skill levels. In addition to closer games, the stats among players on the same team are very close at low level IB. 
---
You hardly ever have the 10 guy, the 8 guy the 1 guy and then 3 sub .5 guys on a team. It usually ranges from say 0.8 to 2. If you have a really good game or make some really good plays (or bad mistakes) it really affects the outcome. It's one of the things I like most about IB. Close games and how I play matters.
---
Holy fuck, thank you. I'm used to getting downvotes for the truth but my god, it's like thrse people legitimately believe Luna's is a win-button on par with aimbotting.
---
Honestly I find skilled use of Luna/NF to be impressive, especially given LH's steep range dropoff; these guns were well-designed to amplify skilled play rather than to forgive poor play, which is a fine distinction that those who haven't tried it unsurprisingly don't understand.
---
And yes, your points about how the meta will simply cascade to the next thing that feeders get tired of being killed by could not be more correct. It really is the same old story.
---
However, it's often easier to hit consecutive head-shots with lunas/nf than ace, on console. Bungie isn't going to change recoil, so the ability to three-tap won't change.
---
Found the console player.
---
I agree. Once you know they have it it’s not hard to avoid. I’m no amazing pvp player but even in Comp around 1900-2100 I’ll see it pretty often. And I’ll use it too and it’s very effective in those games where teams will peek in alleys or shotgunners will try to ape you. Tbh I prefer recluse or shotgun since it’s more consistent and people will just jump. And there are definitely entire teams that run it so you get barraged making it hard unless I’m in a fire team and we are coordinated.
---
Oof
---
Walking Vigil, Spare Rations, and Midnight Coup.  
---
On Console they suck because of bloom, but on PC they have really good TTK.
---
you do realize that those same players could beat you “lower skilled players” using just about anything right?
---
That absolutely does not mean they arent going to nerf anything just that they'll do it less
---
I like two tapping people with Duke and Rampage or an Empowering Rift. :3
---
So he was using citrus as a way to break up the capsaicin oil that causes food to be spicy. Originally he was sucking on lemons but it turned to this.
---
Ty for the correction, and true I've only had very few 2 taps in competitive.
---
It really isn't frequent... and I'm almost 100% sure this is just a way for them to bring these weapons more in line with other console options.
---
Instead of fixing complaints about literally every non 180 HC they choose the cheaper, easier way out.
---
What in the fuck are you talking about? YES, WEAPONS THAT TAKE SKILL TO AQUIRE SHOULD BE BETTER THAN ONES THAT DON'T! 
---
Weapons that RANDOMLY DROP? No, they take nothing but RNG to aquire. 
---
You just suck ass and want Bungie to cater to you. Piss off.
---
well they should be something interesting that rewards a skilled hand with a unique mechanic, not overpowered but otherwise mundane guns
---
It's two guns that took me ages to fucking get.
---
They can but they’d be shit at using it. Luna/NF are only OP when you are getting consecutive crits. Those who get carried or have paid for recovs aren’t making others frustrated, you still need skill to win a firefight regardless of the weapon.
---
Me too but I guess not, unless we still haven't found the secret... (Xfiles theme plays)
---
Erica! You can't be here! There are children around!
---
Seriously bungie is just so dumb right now, we have a month to hope they leave mag howl alone
---
Damn I just got sweet business from a random drop like 2 days ago...
---
GAS GAS GAS
---
how is it? ive heard good things
---
Hey, no need to be rude. Also no need to reiterate what I said about people who have NF being good players. In regards to energy, I meant to type "other than Recluse." Using double special is nerfing yourself with the ammo economy in comp.
---
Thanks! This.
---
Strongly disagree with this. Compared to NF and Luna none of these weapons can compete. The ease of use and TTK of Luna and NF dominate all of these.
---
Yes, you can outgun them every now and then but players of equal skill, one using NF and one using Bygones... NF will win everytime.
---
If these could compete you would see them all at high level Competitive. Instead you only see Dust Rock and Luna/NF.
---
This is actually kind of wholesome
---
ppl wanted communism in destiny 2. Work less get rewarded equally as those you work the hardest.
---
Well said!
---
God I hated that gun so much
---
and you had fun using them right? But now rightly or wrongly Bungie wants to clear the stage for something else to be the best, it could be a more fun and interesting meta than you expected
---
I think you should at least see how it goes before condemning the change
---
Ugh, preach. Hell as a person who (barely) managed to get it legit, mostly due to weekly bonus Glory and the increased gains per win this Season, *I'm* not even good with it.
---
What would be the point though, no exploitation at this point. It was only fun with the bubbles 😂
---
But the main reason Lunas/NF needed to be nerfed was that they were better than almost every primary in the game and meant that if you had them you put yourself at a disadvantage by not using them.
---
and pvp
---
The weekly drop is on a knockout system, have you been doing that?
---
Doom Fang is a campaign reward option...
---
Aeon Soul is a campaign reward option...
---
Sweet Business has no access to it's Catalyst with factions being removed...
---
Lucky Pants show up just in time for Luna's &amp; NF to get nerfed...
---
Basically, Xûr went dumpster diving and this is the shit he surfaced with.
---
Escalation protocol is apart of the Warmind DLC and is a 7-round, with each round increasing in difficulty, survival activity where hordes of hive try to kill you. It rewards you with special legendary weapon and armor drops. The Reckoning is part of the Season of the Drifter, and subsequently the Annual Pass, where you similarly face rounds of taken enemies and progress to a final boss.
---
Give it time, this was always going to happen and always going to sting, I think most will come round eventually
---
Coucou hihi
---
You just too bad to get Luna and NF lol git gud.
---
Unpopular opinion: a vast amount of the community doesn't respect PVE or PVE mains, regarding them as less skilled.
---
Tell me this, wouldn't the PvE community be up in arms if Bungie nerfed cluster bombs and stopped people from one-phasing Riven? They'd be furious.
---
But isn't that the thing that they're firing at 150 rpm but they still handle like 180s in all other aspects? So they shouldn't have all the problems console players seem to have with the lower rpm handcannons.
---
At least that's how I understood it.
---
Luna has the highest DPS of anything that uses primary ammo as far as I can tell.
---
Ohh, ok. Thanks.
---
Yes. I love it so much. Used it on the shattered throne boss rush with revelry rift boost(bottom tree).  Bet vesper of radius is pretty decent for it.
---
I can tell that you were dropped on your head as a child.
---
I need to ask at some point, but what exactly does everyone mean by bloom? Normally I'd think it's muzzle flashes but that doesn't make any sense with console only.
---
I have loads of gameplay on my YT channel, you should come and check it out!
---
Why do you like traction? I tried it a few times and never saw a difference.
---
I’m a fan of the nerf personally. Not because I don’t have them I have both lunas &amp; NF &amp; not because I think they are OP but lunas &amp; NF just kill the variety of weapons to use in crucible if you want to win. I’m just sayin that if you’ve ever been in a competitive game above 3000 glory, it’s very likely that you’ll be versus a 4 stack with lunas/NF &amp; that kinda variety just kills the game in the long run &amp; whether you agree or not the population in comp has decreased &amp; that is a direct result of lunas/NF.
---
You fucked up big time.
---
Why?
---
It doesn't take much to blow through it plus you get exotics along the way.
---
Can't believe that Bonals tried to do the same thing to me lmao he's been banned for harassment. This is why yo don't do these things /u/mrnathanielbennett.
---
reddit crybabies thinking that LH/NF gives aimbot or something, get ready to get destroyed by other guns.
---
I do agree that this nerf absolutely ruined the gun for pve. It was my go to for shredding through pve content running threat level, lunas, and any heavy. But now my friendship with Luna has ended and recluse is my new pve best friend!
---
Who will the warlocks honor?
---
That's not a super difficult thing to do though...
---
Are you on PC? I am as well, and I have been told that traction is actually noticeable on consoles, though I cannot verify this.
---
Respect
---
Spoiling endgame cuz someone yelled at you? Makes you a douche. 
---
“This guy was a meanie so I’m gonna be a bigger meanie...” douche move, kid could grow up and ignore him like everyone else does ....
---
I love giving salty players responses like this. It makes them even more salty, lol.
---
I mean i understand that and TBH with new guns coming into the game all the time its impossible to balance everything and buff/nerf things accordingly i guess what the problem for me is i dont play much PvP id rather do any raid than PvP and i dont care for lunas but that should not make me worse as long as whatever the meta becomes is accessible and counterable its fair in my eyes but i cant see both sides and that a"pinnacle weapon" should be strong but in more creative ways perhaps
---
Im a pvp player who has over 500 hours in pvp alone. Lunas howl alone makes up 11% of all pvp kills, not including the NF. For just one single weapon to have over anywhere between 15-20% of the kills in the game is rediculous. The gun has had over 7 months, that's plenty of time. And before you ask yes I have the weapon, and it doesnt feel skilled. Its not hard to hit shots with a 180 HC. You spent alot of time to get the gun, I understand. But the gun is used far too often. I'm personally sick of seeing this gun, I cant wait for the changes.
---
I would say that for players with a few hundred or more legendary shards, it's worthwhile to buy anything Xur sells if you don't have it already, just so that you won't get it from the fated engram later on. The fated engram costs way more than directly buying things.
---
I mean..... I’ll take it
---
As a mini Grenade launcher in the special slot
---
Yeah i should make that clear. If you got the shards then buy anything you don't have
---
Oh so you want everyone to run NLB and The Recluse? Aight
---
The problem isn't that lunas is op, its overused because people who have it are decent but not good enough to reach the potential of other weapons. Sturm is a much better weapon than lunas will ever be in almost any situation, so is ace of spades (I play on console btw so I can safely say it is better). We should not be justifying bungie nerfing a decent weapon because it is overused. The people complaining about the nerfs are people who know what they are talking about. The people complaining are the main advocates for variety. These changes will make it so that service revolver and a mindbenders/retold tale will be the new meta. There will always be a meta and this change will make even less weapons top tier. A team of all NFs will get rolled by a team of all sturms if they are of equal skill but I don't see people calling for a sturm nerf.
---
But no, just call everyone complaining a child and that we need to 'wake up' when you are the one being childish. I made a post about this subject that compares Luna to other top tier handcannons, showing how it isn't even close to the best. Think before you say something.
---
It's a 140 HC with the recoil of a 180 (close to nothing), and it still does a 3 tap for Head Head Body, you will still enjoy it.
---
Well, it is easy however individual score doesn't mean anything for team play. I'd say try to find players that you can constantly play with and then just work on positioning strats.
---
You're being childish and petty because someone sent you a mean message on the internet (really doesn't even sound like it was that mean and you're overreacting, but w/e). Grow up dude, just ignore dumb messages like that. You added fuel to the fire and made a mountain out of a molehill. This is a learning opportunity to not let every little thing like this affect you so much.
---
Pinnacle weapons are special, which doesn't intently mean they are meant to be more powerful than everything else (especially by the margins at which Luna's Howl and Not Forgotten are).
---
I would love for the next PvP pinnacle to be an absolute shredder of a Sidearm, and for an Exotic Traveler's Chosen to be a thing.
---
I guess I didn’t see that part. Sounded like some kid sent him hate mail. He came here to complain. That’s all I saw
---
NO.
---
It has great range, recoil of a 180, and 3 tap to Head-Head-Body just like before. The nerd isn't as crazy as people are making it seem.
---
That’s a pretty decent one as well tbh
---
Think before you say something.
---
Imagine the people who spent hours clicking those buttons. That alone may have been the very reason they were put in the game.
---
They kill people quicker?
---
Recluse and something like the threat level
---
Cry cry cry
---
That I can work with.
---
which of the 11 rules are you saying I violated with this post?
---
I'm sorry but being a PC player having a gun nerfed due to a problem thats not even happening on my platform is seriously infuriating.
---
Is it not bad? I haven't actually gotten a chance to play with it, from what I was hearing they killed it. I'll have to try it out soon ish to see what my opinion is on it.
---
Bring back Invective. If Bungie does....just look at it this way, I'm not gay but a $20 is a $20
---
How many more posts do we need about this?
---
Yea he tried to brag here that re ruined endgame for someone, which is a super no no that has been happening all over reddit. Just perpetuating toxicity.
---
Okay, those doom perks are much better than what I have on mine. Def will grab those.
---
I just got one with full auto and rampage. It’s pretty solid on everything but range and it’s a lightweight frame so you move faster which is nice.
---
Nope. But I wouldn’t be opposed to it.
---
Then use it.
---
You need to learn what niche means XD
---
Like 4 or 5 I think. It like 1 per planet
---
Preach!
---
Ever played the seasonal forest thingy? I don't know how much ammo you can carry, but for me it's definitely not enough for five bosses in a row
---
Did you ask for a nerf? I got my lunas but still think it needs a nerf. The nerf they release takes it way too far though
---
Haha yeah man true that, but that requires getting a kill with base Breakneck. Unless you stole that kill there's a very, very low chance you're winning any gunfights with a subpar auto rifle. Unfortunately that's what base Breakneck is, a subpar auto rifle when auto rifles themselves are subpar. Getting 3 kills with Breakneck with 5 seconds between kills(rampage spec) in PvP? Man, that's like the least likely scenario I could imagine.
---
Just get a Bygones with Rampage. Infinitely more potent than a Breakneck in PVP, which is aggravating as I want auto rifles to not be shit. Unfortunately hand cannon-pulse rifle meta reigns supreme eternally.
---
I can say from experience that Delirium is amazing. Better than Hammerhead or Thunderlord.
---
It will require less skill as it will now fire slower and still have the same recoil...bungie said it themselves, they want to keep the recoil the same.
---
If you want to talk about skill making headshots easier and requiring less headshots for an optimal ttk is not adding skill.
---
True
---
I did think it would have been fine to nerf them. 
---
But nerf as in make it so 3 crits is a kill...not this 150 rpm BS.
---
Whaaaaaaaaa
---
Yes, but in the moment, it was the best option in my mind.
---
Also not to mention hillarious.
---
Hey, I needed doomfang.
---
I can sorta put myself in the crucible tryhard area. I am ok with the nerf. Because alot of people got lunas this season i got 1st season it was available. If the slower fire rate makes me actually pay attention more as to where i am shooting and that the "normies" with lunas stop using it since it is not as good. I am all for it.
---
People say they want more Sidearms (I do) but what they really need is to realise that the best gun in the game is a side arm and that gun is the Travelers Chosen (Damaged)
---
This was meant to be the exact colours 😅 all the images i found it looked very purple with gold designs on it... so I have no idea what colour it’s actually meant to be 😂
---
Didnt know that the recoil would remain the same but doesnt that make the gun better than literally all other 150 rpms? Since 180s are wayyyyy easier to control than 150s it's still gonna be a good weapon and something unique. So what's the problem?
---
If they nerf LH/NF, it should be relocated into the kinetic slot. Thoughts?
---
Cool, I guess no one else has started to play since the either.  That some BS. Rage!! /s
---
Uh, why *would I* if they make it suck?
---
We heard you wanted Zhalo Supercell, so we added it to Thunderlord.
---
Iron Man dies. So does Natasha. There’s time travel bullshit.
---
Why do you think it was the wrong thing to do? Serious question, non-rhetorical.
---
do you know if using your wall only makes the next grenade you throw powerful or can you get off like 3 on a timer with the tonic?  I am thinking for PvE boss damage...
---
I have gotten the curated outlast at least 6 times before I got a spare rations
---
Appreciated. But zhalo is like 10000 better. That chain effect my gosh it was just a thing of beauty. No disrespect to thunderlord but zhalo is the god of auto rifles
---
I'd hate to see how you react with real life problems geez 👀
---
*PvP players 
---
And it’s fucking amazing
---
That’s some SGA right there!
---
It was YOU! You mad tripmining lad
---
Yep. Pretty much sums it up. I was in a three stack while playing survival, and the other guardian immediately kills himself four times so we can't respawn. Then blames the loss on us. I was Brave 1
---
&gt;They drop one shot unless they’ve been picking up more.
---
&gt;Jotunn kills at range more than close quarters

Neither of those are true. You get more ammo through scavenger perks, up to 3 per brick. It also kills more at mid range, not at long range, because people will just strafe, so ammo pickups aren't a problem.
---
I know! Bunch of salty scrubs bitching got it nerf.  Im good with it and without it but i EARN IT.  It wasnt a random drop like eyeluna.
---
Who mains a gun? That seems counterintuitive.
---
Not saying you’re wrong but chasing Ace of Spades changed my mind about Crucible and now I enjoy it just as much as the PVE. That’s just my experience.
---
Ace uses your exotic slot
---
I forget, does the Wormhusk proc invisibility on its own or do ya gotta use one of the subclass trees??
---
Nf will still be pretty good but lunas is a hard nerf since its got no range anyway there will be alot of other/better guns to use and so theyve made a comp pinnacle weapon not worth it at all
---
Here comes a horde of \*real-pve-players-I-promise-for-sure\* that all apparently used them as their primary constantly all the time forever.
---
I didn’t account for scavenger perks because many don’t run them. A lot of people just use what looks cool. And cool if ammo pick ups aren’t a problem then the enemy team isn’t doing their job of picking up their fallen teammates ammo or pushing you to make sure you can’t get to it. Bottom line is you start with 2 shots.
---
And the scope and snapshot for it was perfect! Lol
---
Yes, there was a note in the TWAB (This Week at Bungie news post) saying that even though there are vex in the Warden of Nothing strike, that strike is erroneously classified as not on the Tangled Shore, so you can't complete the invitation until it is fixed.
---
Special drops from adds, adds drop super orbs, killing adds extend the timer...
---
By sidearms I think you mean insect timber
---
It's amazing with melting point. Got a 3K once when I flew in with tiger knee and they all melee me at the same time.
---
I know it’s worth it to do the Prospector catalyst there....if you have Taken Armaments...
---
Thank you!
---
Only getting 300 pounts in three hours? Hows that a winstreak? Also getting lunas may be complete luck for some but for 80% its not complete luck its either people who tried really hard to finally hit fabled or people who were taking a pitstop at 2100 to continue on
---
Dont hurt my baby. I'm just a lowly warlock who solo queued to get the pve gun of my dreams.
---
There are higher skilled players that usually run with a stacked team that offer “recoveries”. You pay them through PayPal or Venmo and they log into your account and do the work for you. That’s how you buy your pinnacle weapons or even your raid clears. Search for Destiny 2 on eBay and you’ll see tons of listings for these services.

He was just using the opportunity to be humorous. What's pathetic is that you're so negative you don't understand what a joke is.
---
this srsly made me laugh xD great job buddie
---
Bring it
---
*Everything makes sense now...*
---
They could've just buffed other weapons so they could compete with Luna's/NF instead of disappointing everyone that spent time and effort grind for Luna's/NF.
---
This is no longer a good way to farm exotic engrams, since public event (heroic and regular) loot was nerfed several months back. Take any guide older than September 2018 with a hefty pile of salt, as many things in the game were different before then. 
---
Now, the best way to get exotics is to buy from Xur. There is a sticky in this subreddit showing where Xur is and what he is selling whenever he is here. 
---
Once you are above power level 290, you can do the Leviathan raid, which has a very high chance of dropping exotics from the first year of the game (but not from the second year of the game).
---
I got my luna last season and barely used it lol. Anyone saying it and NF dont need a nerf is equal parts delusional and salty.
---
pretty good...but needs more punching.
---
Get good tho. I got it and faced many Luna’s, not that hard to counter if you are good at the game.
---
TWO MORE HAND CANNONS
---
Was just adding to the convo. I'll see myself out.
---
Boss stomos say no to number 5
---
I would like that very much.
---
-Am Luna's user
---
You just put whay I've been thinking into words perfectly.
---
it looks really great too - i played a decent amount during curse of osiris and i didn't get it originally - i've put the amaranth atrocity shader on it - looks great - glad people pointed it out on reddit otherwise i'd have not noticed
---
The Thorns we use are uncorrupted versions created by his cult
---
Ok but I earned that fuckin gun not to have them change it later. Like WTF IS THE POINT OF PINNACLE CHALLENGES THEN.
---
People with Lunas/NF aren't saying this because they had to grind to get those without the guns in the first place.
---
Wym?
---
There’s a problem with bloom on console, that’s why people only run those 2 handcannons.
---
Only because ace of spades is all people will use now and other op weapons will shine and then everyone is gonna complain about those too
---
This was me when telesto nerf happened.
---
Like they have a lot of cash to drop
---
i played 14 crucible matches today grinding for some "EASY" glory
---
11/14 games there was a portable FUCK YOU waiting around every corner, combine with fastball and it's a goddham linear fusion shotgun
---
I love the revelry
---
We shall see my dude. If these guns see play I can assure you it won't be because they are the top choice, just viable. How can you possibly justify making a pinnacle weapon anything but one of the best options. Whether it's OP now doesn't matter but where they will take it down to is overkill.
---
For NF yes, but Luna’s is now a fucking trash can.
---
Because Lunas is gonna keep the recoil of a 180 even with a 150 rpm? And its gonna be able to 3 tap at Head Head Body, as opposed to the other 150s which can only 3 tap at 3 consecutive headshots with recoil like a mofo.
---
ace has fucking pulse rifle range you idiot. stay out of range and move while you shoot. people are saying LH/NF were crutches. what do you think is going to happen when they get a 150 that can 3 tap with 2 heads and a body? they were what a pinnacle weapon should be. they rewarded accuracy and good play. now they reward poor play. now they truly are a crutch.
---
For console players, not pc players. Which means there is a fundamental problem with other hand cannons and how they handle. Not these handcannons specifically.
---
I was just thinking of an  melee ability that removes all ammo from your opponents gun (or suppresses for PvE)
---
Just an idea I had, idk if it would be worthless or OP
---
