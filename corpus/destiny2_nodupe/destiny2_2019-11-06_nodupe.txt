Scourge of the Past is probably your best bet without including Leviathan or lairs.
---
yep totally satire dude i belive you 100 percent
---
Leviathan prolly my favorite in d2.
---
PC? Timezone?
---
Eriana's Vow is actually a hand cannon that uses special ammo and goes in the energy slot. But it is an exotic so I dunno if that changes things.
---
Kerchoo

Scourge is the easiest without being too easy.

If you want something really watered down do Eater of Worlds, it's almost a strike. Just bring some heavy firepower, the final boss is a bullet sponge.

still better than precision final blow with hand cannon or killing invaders in gambit
---
Nah mate, Baeda-1 or nothing.

I don't have Mountaintop yet, but I don't see why it wouldn't work. A lot of people used it in end game content.
---
Crown of Sorrows isn't incredibly hard. You just need a fire team that communistes really well. My first time doing it barely took 1 hour and 45 minutes, with 3-4 newbies

Recently farmed out my recluse quest, I'm going to assume your playing free lance because it's the way to go for solo players.
---
I'll say is that Snipers and shotguns are very important, They were for me atleast. If you're good with a sniper the enemy team will lose two life's right of the bat. Once you play enough you'll learn which Spots to hold and get easy kills at the start of the rounds. It got to the point were 70% of my kills per game were from a sniper. The rest came from my primary. Just use whatever primary weapon you do best with I used the . And as heavy use a heavy machine gun. The Exotic is obviously very dependent on your character or playstlye unless your a titan then you can simply pick the OEM. I think I used a mixture of Young ahamkara's spine and Dragons shadow on my hunter. 
---
One tip I do have is that camping the heavy spawn can be more beneficial than getting the heavy. A lot of people blindly go for it so you can easily kill them and get it for yourself afterwards. 
---
with supers use them to secure round wins rather than getting kills. Because a round were you may get three kills with a super would still be a waste as you ended up losing anyway. 
---
Lastly sticking together is very important. Even if you aren't communicating being able to team shot and having teammates to help you if you get low is very important. I've seen so many people break off from the team and try and solo three guys which is very unlikely to happen. Plus if you're having a bad game try and stick behind your team and try not to waste your lives as hopefully they'll be able to carry you through with you giving support from behind 
---
Hope you got something from this. And good luck
---
Lag also you have terrible aim.

Ohhhhhh. Now I get it!

without spoiling? play the campaign some more he will show up later
---
"Me and my PvE build" .... well that's one of your problems right there. Perks and weapons that dominate PvE are generally trash in PvP. 
---
The main things you need to worry about are having good weapons, mainly good special weapons, and using the right supers. PvP, especially in competitive, is where you want to use the best stuff. Your opponents most likely will be. You're not necessarily going to be using your favorite weapons unless your favorites just happen to be good PvP weapons. Things like max range Dust Rock, Mindbender's with Slideshot, Revoker, Beloved, Jotunn, Erentil with Backup Plan etc. should be in your arsenal to keep things on an even playing field when you're getting destroyed by these same weapons. There are players who can go in with an Austringer and an Aachen-LR2 and dominate but those guys are already really good at the game. 
---
Stay with your teammates, but don't hug their asses. You should be there to jump out and team shot or hit from different angles to get kills but not so close to your teammates that you're backing up into each other or blocking each other's shots. Crouch if you know a teammate is shooting from behind you. 
---
The biggest tip I can think of though, is play lives. If your team gets the first kill, you should be letting the enemy come to you for easy team shots, not pushing up risking your lives. If it comes down to it you can win rounds just by getting a couple kills and playing the waiting game. It'll force opponents to make dumb pushes because they will either have to even the life count or take the L.

I still don't like that the pride emblem is only available if you give bungie money. Companys love to make money off the lgbt+ community but it always seems like that's the only reason they ever support us.

i don't think so but it would be a waste to upgrade this early in the campaign annyway

Oh no spooky number religion bad

That doesn't help when you're in the middle of a one-v-one in the hunter in front of you decides he wants to shadestep get his health back and now you're at the disadvantage.

Yes

Nice

I knew the optimum strategy for wins was to stay on the points, but I kind of needed the kills and medals for Randy's.

With a range masterwork it's pretty good

Yes, people should only use what you suggest. Perhaps a khvostov paired with a green auto. Is that good or do we need to search for shittier weapons?

Try warlock handheld when a titans rushing. 1 shots and you can build for it. Don‚Äôt worry reckon they‚Äôve given titans and hunters a benefit this season to massively op warlocks next. Btw I‚Äôm a hunter but play void and the only 1 shots I get are through snipes so hopefully you don‚Äôt hate me too much üòÇ

Replace Titans with high latency and this meme would be spot on.  I lose every trade as a titan vs shotguns ever since getting decent internet.

It's just all situational yes heavy can change the tide of battle but u gotta make sure u hit your mark in the end it comes down to teamwork and positioning at not just heavy but around the map or if in overtime at the flag

Kinderguardian here, anyone wanna explain???

You got a real CRAP attitude if you even expect to be taken seriously. Get good scrub, is what YOU fail to grasp. If you put half as much energy into playing instead of coming here and crying like a freaking entitled casual you might win some.
---
You should be able to progress relatively well if you manage a 1k/d. If you‚Äôre good at sniping use it, made my comp journey so much easier, put a build together for pvp. I play my pvp build in pve as the content is less sweaty but never play a pve build in pvp, especially comp
---
Lol did you happen to see any "robert e.o. speedwagons" today
---
On second thought right now I hate nightstalkers but only because of momentum control otherwise they're pretty cool

Even if they are the same which they're not 1 of them gives you help instantly which will help in the middle of a gunfight. Now can you leave me alone
---
I‚Äôve been using it for the past 50 minutes, I got the hang of it!
---
Don‚Äôt play momentum as the jade rabbit metas boring and made for easy play which is sad because I think it‚Äôs such a good idea
---
Absolutely a man of culture.
---
Old tower was destroyed by the Cabal. It was under the Traveler
---
You can see the old tower from the new towers location in D2, and the traveler has been in the same spot through both games. The ship you got was in the cosmodrome, and had to get to the city, not yet to orbit.
---
Mate your friends dumb you can see the old tower from the new one
---
challenges (blue markers where vendors would be), get a lot of bounties and just click all at once. really satisfying.
---
I've not tried it in crucible before but it works wonders in gambit. Team melts like a dream. And I agree, the rage that usually follows is palpable.
---
I‚Äôm good at all pvp modes. I‚Äôm hold a 1.8 In comp and a little higher in quickplay. Not easy to do. I can succeed just fine in all modes but momentum give a lesser skilled player a chance to succeed far too often. You don‚Äôt need jade rabbit but it‚Äôs the meta in the mode sadly. It one bangs for all ranges why not use it. It‚Äôs basically a hard core playlist from cod. It takes all the skill out of a higher ttk game. Something a high skill ceiling player doesn‚Äôt enjoy.
---
Nah I‚Äôm good with Amanda, the first chick that we get to see besides from ikora

take your downvote

You say "guardian" almost exactly like him

Hey that black ship is me loooll
---
No doubt about it.
---
i was dicking around in iron banner and i said something in his voice and then i realized something deep inside me had awoken
---
\- String of curses gives super energy, so yes bad juju is exotic, you dont have legendaries giving free super on top of the kill amount.  
---
\- recluse is often likened to huckleberry. but huckle has kills reload mag and (now) unnerfed rampage stacking. while recluse is a 1 off damage buff that sure it proccs of any weapon kill, but is still lacking something to make it exotic, but it far stronger than legendarys  
---
\- revoker has high range because its a 72rpm, it has near equal range to silicon neuroma. and its aim assists is 44 where as supremacy has 77, alone as a god has even more. 140rpm have the highest ranges of aim assist. Sure the ammo back on missed shot is strong, but its nothing like icebreaker, so no its not exotic tier.   
---
\- Mountain top is not the only breach grenade launcher that can one shot, spike grenades on orwings maul and militias birthright both can one shot, i used both to get my mountain top. it really only had the linear launch that makes it unique. but its not exotic because it doesnt have an exotic tier perk. fighting lion - does more damage against shields, kills refill mag, and kills always drop ammo. prospector - can detonate all grenades at the same time. compared to those 2 (because we dont have an exotic special GL) mountain top lack in the perk department, it literally just shoots straight and is kinetic.  
---
so no they arent enough to be exotic, but they are far stronger than other legendaries. the current most used weapons in pvp is lunas, recluse, revoker, and dust rock. but theres something strange right there, 3 are pinnacles, and the other is a world drop, showing how much a god roll can do to a weapon. sure nothing can roll with the likes of reversal of fortune, nor is it a complete change to the gun type, but sometimes perks can put stuff on top, but that doesnt mean they are on par with exotics, this issue is these guns are a lot stronger than other guns of similar archetype that are exotic because they allow exotics to beused alongside them, and some exotics just arent that valuable.

for attachments you can‚Äôt go wrong with targeting adjuster/ counterbalance/ or if you want more ammo backup mag.

No it really isnt. Hand canons are easyer in every way, have a higher rpm (mostly) and are way more forgiving. Hand gambit Invaders is easy anyway.

Such foul language Bungue, thanks for saving me from it while I murder with grenades.
---
It really depends on what you have for gear and what you want your playstyle to be. Do you want to focus on grenades and do aoe damage? Or do you want to get your super asap so that you can maximize your damage or provide orbs for other guardians to use.
---
You also want to make sure that you have good recovery and resilience. Raids will give you the best armor with better stats, so I'd recommend doing those.
---
what‚Äôs happening here?
---
No! Not during NNN!
---
Dude I'm a hunter main, haven't played anything else, I just feel like doo doo in pvp

i have this role with drop mag and it was my favorite handcannon for pve for like 15k kills, it‚Äôs the highest damage you can get on a hand cannon iirc

Yea you're good, itll complete it once you're finished the double kills. You might need to play another match or log out and log back in for it to update tho.

Keep one Guardian in the room with the four orbs. Can‚Äôt wipe if 1/3 can‚Äôt die. Plus the cheeser can remind the others of their symbols.
---
You continue to prove that you are stubborn about your opinion the whole point of momentum control is to be unfair. People are going for pinnacles, others are having fun. complaining about how a weapon is used and justifying it on the fact that you used it doesn‚Äôt make it any better. No they won‚Äôt nerf it because it‚Äôs FUN to use, the whole point of the game is to have FUN so instead of proving a stupid point and complaining that the community doesn‚Äôt like your point why don‚Äôt you just play the game.
---
She is alive

Kindled orchid is the black armoury hand cannon (black armoury weapons are unlocked by the forge quest line and frames to make specific weapons are bought from the vendor Ada-1 in the tower. Look a up a video in ‚Äúhow to unlock the forges, destiny 2‚Äù that‚Äôll probably get you a good video). The kindled orchid is a 150 rpm handcannon I believe so it shoots really slow and hits harder and the only time I‚Äôd use it is if you have kill clip/rampage, allowing you or OHK most pve enemies and to even two two majors if you can get yourself an extra buff. Blast furnace is the black armour pulse rifle, which is notoriously known for being very user friendly, often being called the ‚Äúdad furnace‚Äù, due to its ease of use, that  would attract many casual dad gamers towards it (still not best pulse rifle in game, that‚Äôs grobably go figure or chattering bone I believe). Hammerhead is the black armoury light machine gun and is the top tier LMG to use in pvp.  On to menagerie drops. Menagerie drops many weapons that aren‚Äôt specific to the activity, as Bungie added many fan favourite weapons to the menagerie loot pool. Menagerie quest line can be started by talking to banshee I believe, where you will eventually be given a chalice to be able to forge different weapons. You‚Äôll need to upgrade the chalice to unlock different weapons (specific runes will be unlocked through upgrading the chalice, which are needed to make different weapon combinations). The greatest benefit of farming through the menagerie is that the chalice allows you to pick your masterwork, search up menagerie loot guide and menagerie unlock guide for help. Austringer is a very consistent hand cannon, which is probably up top on best hand cannons in the game, with sol survivor just beating it. Beloved is the most meta sniper in the game rn, able to be rolled with both snapshot and QuickDraw at the same time (I prefer snapshot/moving target since the playstyle I use doesn‚Äôt utilize quickdraw, but the sniper‚Äôs aim assist is naturally quite high so it‚Äôs very consistent). Erentil is often considered the bane of some people‚Äôs existence, with certain rolls being able to OHK at absurd distances (idk what it is but search it up, it‚Äôs quite good). Trust is another fan favourite hand cannon, having a very consistent recoil pattern that people often find helpful. Parcel of stardust is a good shotgun as well, idk shotguns too well but I find parcel of stardust can be very consistent and if rolled correct, it can OHK at a very nice range.
---
Are you on the same character or a different on?
---
Erintel can triple collateral in normal game mode too...I got it one time accidentally when I was doing the iron banner quest but I don't have any footage to prove it
---
Git gud scrub. Jk but seriously, get good. Find a weapon load out that works for you and practice practice practice. D2 is all about the grind. For me I mainly use slug shotguns. Once you find what works build your armor around your weapons.
---
Does anyone taste salt?

Nope

Lol you started the name calling and once I said something you cry about it? Dude I‚Äôm just gonna let you know you‚Äôre a straight up bitch. I must have struck a nerve in your miserable life cause you just spoke about life as if it was the most terrible thing created. The way you describe growing up is extremely depressing and i honestly shouldn‚Äôt have argued with you, I didn‚Äôt know how bummed out by life you were. You act like going to college and working is some huge accomplishment that is impossible to do. You realize most people do that nowadays right? You described an average joe lifestyle as if it was nearly impossible. Think about that for a second. You must have really lived a shitty life and now you gotta let me know how shitty mine will be. I‚Äôm doing great currently man and I‚Äôm looking forward to experiencing what life has to offer. I don‚Äôt view the future in a negative way like you do and I‚Äôm sorry you feel that way. Try some shrooms and you can fix that maybe lol. Also once again idk what ‚Äúsmoking shrooms‚Äù means. At this point your saying it to discredit it and you must have a huge ego to continue to say that after being corrected.
---
Did you ever realize I had to repeat things cause you kept saying the same shit over and over yourself? Get over yourself dude. You‚Äôre living the most basic, normal life you could yet you still are an egotistical, fuck that thinks he‚Äôs smarter than everyone. You tell me to quit like a man yet that whole comment was just you crying out about hard your life has been. Grow up and realize no one cares and most people go through the same struggle.
---
Love how you say I have nothing to look forward to in life except shrooms. You‚Äôre just projecting at that point cause you clearly hate the life you live. Not everyone is as miserable as you. And shrooms are a blast to eat with friends when the time comes. So yea my 4 shroom trips a year are things I look forward to, along with graduating college, getting a job, spending time with family and friends, traveling, playing video games and watching movies, etc. I‚Äôm really enjoying my life right now man and I‚Äôm sorry to hear yours is so bad that hearing me enjoy an occasional shroom trip brought out the utter sadness within you.
---
So I‚Äôll end it here, you don‚Äôt need to respond anymore unless you really want to. Good night and don‚Äôt assume everyone who takes a ‚Äúdrug‚Äù lives a life where said drug is the only thing they enjoy. Also don‚Äôt be so upset with life, there‚Äôs a whole lot of good to experience. Good night kid

Seems the drop rate for them is very low

I thought you tossed 2 grenades, I was so confused for a while.

Are there any updates when the Izanagis Quest will get fixed ?

Im sigging at 2/4 Locks unlocked but i already used 3 keys ;/
---
I don't know. I had to restart it because I made a new character. Reading through the other comments, it looks like you still use the same character.

Unfortunately yes. I was even unlucky enough to get a few other catalysts for weapons I never use while farming :(

I run a 1050ti as well and dont have any issues. How much Ram do you have?? I run on ultra setting as well.

Blink has never been Op. If anything it's the worst jump in the game. In PvE you can't even climb effectively with it and it takes a hot second to get your bearings once it ends. It sucks in all honesty. I never use it.
---
LOL hhhh
---
Lol. Not like warlock‚Äôs have an exotic that gives your enemies position everytime you stub your toe on their bullet casing or have wallhacks just for crouching and getting a precision kill. Shame they have a OHK grenade amiright
---
obviously talking about PVP
---
Ah well that just sucks
---
\*Fred Durst flies by on his sparrow\*

***KEEP ROLLIN ROLLIN ROLLIN ROLLIN***
---
That isn't what i'm saying, though. It clearly stats that solo'ing the shattered Throne at 999 will break the curse... but it doesn't. Bungie should have said from the start that it wouldn't. They KNEW people were racing to 999.. and said nothing.. I know nobody forced the people to play that much, but not saying anything enabled it.
---
Seems pretty clear to me what i'm talking about.
---
16 GB ram, I5-7500 cpu.
---
No
---
how the hell do they level their artifact so quickly?
---
There's a perk if your clan is level 4 I think, where If you do strikes/crucible with clan mates catayslt have a higher drop rate
---
Wait, as a non OEM Titan, is that a grenade or a melee ability? Because I have a friend who mains warlock who couldn't throw his handheld supernova
---
It sucks in PvP too. Sure it's annoying but it's not broken. I'm a bad PvP player and I have no issues countering Blink and I'm a Warlock myself. Blink is rather useless in the right hands you can be a dick with it. But its anything but broken. I think you just suck.

Yep. Should be a way of farming for a specific catalyst. I‚Äôve got wardcliff and sturm catalysts and I‚Äôll never use either lmao
---
He's just protecting you from a useless exotic

And that's why they won't put guns on them!

Took me a second

I request that you do ASMR. I will never lose sleep again

Yep. Have u played through the oracle engine mission? You missed all the cutscenes from season 4, but if you look it up on YouTube ull get the idea.

I am scared to think what arc coil titans are like on pc with skating

You have to be middle tree voidwalker and you hold your grenade down to charge it. Once it‚Äôs charged you can release and it‚Äôll be a handheld supernova

Definitely wouldn't mind being in between that war.

yeah i totally suck dude. i know im bad but im still coming to reddit to complain. im just complaining that they are OP cause i just suck

We need a buff to our nutral game
---
But they did say something.. it says in the lore that solo'ing the dungeon at 999 will break the curse.. it didn't.
---
So they should have made people aware that it either isn't ready yet, or that nothing happens.

At least you're honest. Acceptance is the first step in making one's self a better person. Now we shall do zen hums...hhuuummmmmmmmmmm
---
I believe it may be that Bungie planned this to happen in the future, making some journey, where most players are already coming and surpassing 999 light.

thanks!

whats it like to have a one hit melee? a healing rift? an OP ass grenade that takes no skill? what about that stupid blink ability? but my shadestep is so OP even though aim assist still tracks me going around the corner with it

Thank you! So that means I should pretty much buy every mod I see in Banshee's shop.

Thanks!

Yeah that‚Äôs a really good take on it. I‚Äôll rethink MO but still handheld rules I‚Äôm afraid.
---
Did you stay there for the rest of the encounter
---
Almost as fun as shoulder charging with Skullfort. The impact of the shoulder feels so satisfying
---
The lore book is literally full of lies. I get that players had to give it a shot out of curiosity. But honestly getting hyped for anything to happen was pretty dumb.
---
It's already been done. Nothing happened

Doing what?

Damn I want one

You should be put on a cringe subreddit. This is good content.
---
It's also very good for empowered buff melee build
---
Oh what's that perk listed as?
---
My Duke rolled with Sureshot sights/ Flared Magwell/ Opening shot/ Rampage. Currently pairing it with Eriana‚Äôs Vow and Lucky pants with enhanced hand cannon dexterity added on top. What makes this combo great is that you can get the headshot with Eriana‚Äôs then instaswap to Duke with opening shot which then activates Rampage allowing for a 2-tap headshot. I call it the 2-Tap No Cap combo.
---
Can confirm that you can receive weapons from pinnacle bounties
---
I‚Äôd still hardly refer to it as OP as the original post does, since they can‚Äôt be spammed like certain shoulder charge builds or or OEM, but I will agree that they‚Äôre strong

But... What about Holliday?

But you would get a white from it right?

Well I used a key as soon as the supposed fix dropped, realised it didn't work, then checked their forums/Twitter when I was done playing for the day, and what do you know...they said it was still bugged.

I believe it's 10am

What's the significance of getting a 7th column?  Is it just for the prestige of it, or is it required to unlock something/complete a quest or task?
---
OK Here I go
---
Have to kill main vex offensive boss first
---
It's a mentality thing. They think they can only use their super in a win or die situation, rather than using it to make your opponents scatter or push you to take you out, inturn making it easy for team shots and free super kills. Just my thoughts on it thought..
---
Only if bungie had to turn it on manually, bc he Got the triumph for solo and had 999 light
---
But i really doubt they would say it didn't count, theyre not assholes after all
---
i put my heart and soul into this content
---
how dare they call it cringe
---
yknow
---
I'm pretty sure you have to solo it at 999.

Your team was losing, The Soviet Union had to also lose to uphold communism beliefs.

Is it necessary to have all three classes running simultaneously in order for level well? What about those of us who are okay with one class and putting in the time?

Stuck, btw.

Yeah just ignore it and kill kill kill. I ignore it for 2/3 days and then look because at least then it seems as if its moving
---
The wish wall in LW has codes you can input, for ethereal keys, skipping to checkpoints, Easter egg voice lines, petras run, a random song and a chest spawn
---
You asked for an exotic heavy weapon and my man here literally gave it to you. Izanagis is in the kinetic slot.
---
Guessing they meant say dawning set?
---
true, you just need that ship from master nightfall: ordeal fot Badge Season of undying :)
---
Yup! I‚Äôll PM it to you since mobile is a pain
---
He is scary but trevor is the most terrifying thing I have ever seen
---
Izanagi is also bugged rn so I figured whisper is a better idea. Catalyst takes a while to get though, but I‚Äôd recommend going for it
---
I mean, I'm trying man, but at this point it's a problem of "their gun shoots faster than mine" that or I overestimate the importance of resilience mods
---
There is a Wish wall in the Dreaming city raid... One of the wishes for example takes solo players to a chest.
---
Wish 15 wasn't confirmed anywhere yet, but someone has spotted that reaching light level 999 may reveal the true destiny of the dreaming city at the Wish wall.
---
fuck
---
There have been multiple bugs regarding this quest.  Bungie put out a fix a weekish ago however, if I'm correct, another bug showed up that is due to be patched on Thursday, or so they say.
---
You're also an insufferableanus, so there's that.
---
*gives helmet to people by ikora working on portal
---
Was not aware thatvworm was a heavy
---
Funfact:
---
When I was doing the Lw run for the eggs, two of my friends used to go that way to get the egg because me and other teammates was having dinner. When I login, they told me they already got the egg and started showing me about the parkour. As a joke, I went to the opposite side of the room, refusing to do the parkour, and I was able to see the egg (actually the right way to get it).
---
After that they wiped
---
euh, i just did that yesterday, 100.200 or something so its possible. rip my pinnacle
---
Maybe they need to do it with armor and weapon levels at 999 not the artifacts
---
Can I ask a quick question, because I dont understand. I've seen several people referencing the fact that it isn't a full curse week, but I thought the only way to run shattered throne was if it was a full curse week. I would try googling but only find the curse weeks schedule, and not an explanation. Thank you to any kind souls in advance
---
They only give you rewards once per character per week.
---
Let me ask you a question, and be honest. If I were to point it out, would it change your mind on whether you consider it whining or not?
---
You already have access to your own words, you already know what you have said, and you don't consider any of it whining. Me showing it to you won't change your stance on those words. And the reason you don't think I'm not showing you any whining is because you don't think there is any, well no shit, you don't think you are whining, so therefore you don't think there is any. At least try to understand your own logical fallacies.
---
Sigh...
---
*Unzips...*
---
There's also the Destiny Easter egg in Halo. Can't recall which one. You find a computer terminal that has a picture of the traveler and it says "Destiny Awaits"
---
With shadowkeep launch bungie made shattered throne available every week not just when the curse is strong
---
Fairly certain Izanagi's Burden requires Forsaken to acquire, at least that's how it's listed in the above exotics guide/list.
---
What about pinnacle?
---
I play on PS4, so if you're struggling I'd be happy to show you it's exact spot.
---
Well it‚Äôs wrong. The guy did it on stream in front of a ton of people. Not to mention Zupah who was in the lead is 998 now too
---
Literally the best and fastest way to get that part of the Quest done. Did it in one evening in Momentum Control by playing Fusion only.
---
REALLY?!?! Welp, I done goofed
---
I beat The Red War and Curse of Osiris back when they came out, then quit playing. I recently got the next expansion when it was on sale on steam, so I'm playing though Warbringer now, but is there any reason to go back and re-do the first two years of missions? I didn't particularly like them.
---
The real issue is that Truth to Power is unreliable. There are some things that will happen and have happened. There are other things that won‚Äôt happen. I haven‚Äôt seen anyone upset about it. I think very few people actually thought it would work.
---
delete this normie
---
I have Hastilude, but I'm upset about the fiery one.
---
According to the leader board, no one is 999 yet
---
Braytech Werewolf is from Festival of the Lost, and you'll need to complete the [Master of Disguise Triumph](https://heavy.com/games/2019/10/braytech-werewolf-auto-rifle-destiny-2/) to unlock it. After that you can spend candy and chocolate coins to purchase random rolled versions of it.
---
I can relate got it the November after it came out. Currently have all exotics/catalysts. Also I have sunk at least $500 or more into the game/irl merch.
---
Hey I just got to 950 earlier today, but I feel like my damage is on the really low side compared to other people and some videos I watched doing the same content, for example Zero Hour. Right now I'm aiming for exotics, and maybe better rolls for my equips, but I don't see how it would improve my damage by percentages because the damages I see from other people seem to be more than twice than me, and probably more. Is there like a path that I should look at or prioritize to see how I can deal more damage?
---
Can wish 15 bring back cayde :(
---
The highest stat gear I seem to find only has come from a 3 main sources. 
---
The raid
---
Iron banner (59 I have gotten) 
---
The legendary halloween grab bags (25 chocolate coins and 300 candy) 
---
I gave up on the looks of the armor and just use ornaments.
---
I need an adult.
---
Thank u that‚Äôs what I wanted to know.
---
Yea, forges are on a daily rotation now. It goes:
---
\-Volundr (Earth/EDZ)
---
\-Gofannon (Nessus)
---
\-Izanami (Nessus)
---
\-Bergusia (Earth/EDZ)
---
Then it starts over in that order.
---
What the fuck I‚Äôm not even 940 yet come on
---
I did some tings that I looked up, it‚Äôs apart of the last wish raid and it gives you nifty things within it, just Easter eggs seemingly from what I can tell.
---
What is it you're asking?
---
Or just use warden's law and be a two tap meme
---
You can‚Äôt point it out.
---
Cause I‚Äôm not whining.
---
All I said was: 
---
Scouts need a nerf in Momentum.
---
Oh no! He has an opinion! 
---
I think momentum is great. It‚Äôs my favourite game mode of all time. Still am allowed to think Scouts need a nerf.
---
Yup! Don‚Äôt worry my bf spoiled a shit ton for me already
---
Ahh, that makes sense, thank you!
---
General Grievous escapes Obi-Wan Kenobi
---
How do you get the emblem?

Slap your bf for me would ya? Lol
---
All the time
---
1. That's not really a cheat, it's more of an exploit.  
---
2. Your comment that you can only get a certain number of pinnacles is inherently false, and the comment I'm replying to doesn't contain your additional stipulation.
---
Damnit lol I had such high hopes with your responses :(
---
In the hell I can't eat pudding XD
---
I can't for the life of me think about any gun in any fps game that is balanced if at any moment has the same headshot damage as bodyshotting.
---
Yeah it works well if you have a super/heavy/grenades that can stall when the spawn flips. Just gotta cap for lockdown in IB.
---
That's definitely true
---
You just want it to be different.
---
Right? Still have a few items that are supposed to be here next week. I have a decent collection set up next to my tv on shelves. I plan on posting a pic of it all next week when the rest of my stuff gets here and I put up another shelf.

I want Ada-1 to step on me

---
Forskin xDDDDDDD 
---
But yeah same here :D
---
&gt;Just more evidence supporting the fact that Jade Rabbit and other long range scouts need a fat nerf in Momentum Control.
---
I was just playing the game, on my 20th try against a higher level Bracus Zahn, and I got banned, we were so close, so close to beating him too
---
Oh **hell to the fucking yeah**. I have never put this much time into one game. I didn‚Äôt know I had it in me

Handcannon

---
People don't keep the same loadout equipped at all times...I have 3 separate setups just for Gambit. 
---
Bagel4k used his pinnacle power on Anarchy...and some people don't use Anarchy for everything. His Worldline Zero he currently has equipped is only 930.
---
It only goes by what is currently equipped on the character, not the maximum light the player can achieve.
---
It clearly did work cus I got a 13 streak with a near 2.5 kda
---
Diablo 4 announcement had me finally buy the Necromancer add on and play to scratch that itch last night.

All the while thinking ‚Äúyou‚Äôve got Iron Banana to plaaaaaaaaaay... pinnacle rewards to eaaaaaaarn...‚Äù
---
This will be how it is when Pok√©mon releases next week, I‚Äôm sure.
---
Agreed it's a tad steep IMO, be nice to see if someone could make it out of the same material for cheaper.  Still an awesome show piece and cosplay accessory though!
---
Don't know what that means
---
Some blueberries are just worthless
---
Spike Grenades+Field Prep is consensus.

This used to be the DPS best in slot, and it's still second best in slot.

did u cry

I only got the game a year ago, about a week before forsaken came out. Since then, I‚Äôve completed every raid, earned almost every pinnacle weapon and title, every exotic and all but 3 catalysts, reaches max level every season, made friends and a clan through matchmaking and LFG, and sunk almost 2000 hours into this game. Thank you Bungie for making such a great game and community

Peace was never an option

"this is what the taken feel. revel in this"
---
82 hours for me. a few friends got me into the game, they've stopped playing but im still getting games in every day. I get addicted to finishing things so I need to get the season pass to 100 or ill regret it later, lol.
---
Template please?
---
5. ????
---
6. Profit
---
No, i loaded my ass into the dreaming city and saw the curse is on week one maybe we have to wait for full curseweek but that‚Äôs wishful thinking
---
watches others get addicted to destiny 2 for free when you paid for every expansion is like watching someone getting free heroin.
---
You can't provide anything other than "I don't think it should be this way even though Bungie made it to be this way on purpose." This isn't a bug, or anything unintended. It's working 100% as intended. There is no problem other than you claiming you love the mode, but still stating it needs to be something different than what it is.   
---
"My favorite color is yellow.... but if only it wasn't so bright.... or loud.... or yellow.... Maybe if it was blue.... but no it's still my favorite color... Just wish it wasn't what it is."
---
Do they just have a really high artifact then? Shame that it resets when the season ends then
---
JpDeathBlade's Twitter ([https://twitter.com/JpDeathBlade](https://twitter.com/JpDeathBlade)) posted the infographics on Oct 29. It might still be the pinned tweet on his account, and so far, still seems to be accurate.
---
I personnaly use lion rampant with fighting lion for that extra crispy movement. Oem is definatly crutch play for grenade launxher kills.lol
---
Prestigious
---
1. Ok Mr. Pedantic. Clearly you have never heard the phrase "[cheating the system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaming_the_system)" before.
---
2. Go ahead and prove how someone could go about getting an non limited amount of pinnacles each week, without cheating the system of course.
---
But what they are doing is ok? Reporting people for being better
---
....
---
here‚Äôs to hoping dude üçª
---
armor you need on each character individually because there is different armor for each class, if you collect warlock armor and try to put it on a titan it will say "requires warlock class" weapons are universal and can be reacquired on all classes
---
thanks for clearing it up.
---
Literally what I thought and opened the comments to see this :P
---
Thank you for responding.
---
Nah, since forsaken lol
---
Not bad... very cool
---
I'm still holding out hope for cayde's actual body that we revive in some long forgotten exotic cryo facility
---
I know that, if you read the post he is only talking about armor, so when I made my original comment I was also only talking about armor, you should pay more attention to the actual post and comment instead of just trying to be right
---
Amateur, I've been here since alpha
---
I‚Äôm just trying to agree to disagree but you obviously can‚Äôt figure that out
---
You are *literally* just wrong dude. Look at the Truth to Power book titled Act|Choose|React, then get the bib on and start eating your words
---
I get where you're coming from. I was doing the same thing until last week. I've been playing D2 for only 2 weeks, but I come from Warframe, which is another looter shooter and that made it easy for me to grasp stuff like min-max gear, god roll, etc.
---
Keep doing what you're doing. Nothing to feel bad about. First priority should be to enjoy the game of course. But if you feel like you want to put in the effort, you could watch a few videos on this stuff on YouTube. It helped me a lot and that's why I'm recommending it.
---
[indeed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tm8FwzHUGCs)
---
He was punished when the guardian killed him
---
No idea what any of that means
---
 Are you French?
---
Or or or hear me out, I can actually get proof that it works *Gasp noises* instead of the book that actively spouts lies and misdirection just being taken at its word ‚ÄúOH SHIT?!‚Äù
---
I know I just blew your mind like you blew the YouTube overlord that I actually want tangible proof that the book that lies is telling the truth
---
This whole thing started because u said that destiny YouTubers made this level 999 up but thats not true I offered to show u  the lore but u refuse to accept the truth smh
---
I started playing destiny 2 when it came out a few years ago but stopped before the first 2 dlcs came out because there was nothing to do. I came back to the game at the beginning of the summer this year and I have played an ass-load of the game and all its dlc and I still have yet to touch a lot of the content I missed because of Shadowkeep and FotL. It is insane how much there is to do and for the average Joe Schmoe Destiny player I don't know if I'll ever run out of stuff to do.
---
Damn. Could have been a 4.0 with an internship.
---
The agree to disagree mentality is a cancer in discussion and should be expunged
---
PepeLaugh oh no no
---
I have that one but it doesn't have full court which is the range perk. Thanks for the info
---
Yeah exactly. If you‚Äôre searching for other sources of exotics, nightfall the ordeal on legend and master has a pretty high chance of giving an exotic. There is also a guy called Xur who sells exotics every week, you should look him up.
---
That kinda takes away the unique thing about a hunter
---
Them cursed thralls coming out of nowhere get me every time. Then you use your hand cannon that normally one-shots lesser enemies and they don't *quite* die.
---
There‚Äôs an old clip of a WWII style game of a player running in front of an ally sniper (the game has friendly fire) he gets domed and stumbles to the ground. The guy then runs back across the his FOV and gets domed again dying. It‚Äôs the greatest clip and I can‚Äôt for the life of me find it. Sometimes I wish D2 had friendly fire you could enable..
---
Also is anyone knows the clip please link me!!
---
*insert no one cares meme*
---
So you want me to all of a sudden change my mentality just to make you happy
---
Recluse kills variety
---
Can you cite where I said that?
---
Oh wait I didn‚Äôt, i decry the YouTube overlords because they peddle the nonsense and then others peddle it, the book about lies and misdirection shouldn‚Äôt be taken at its fucking word, perhaps that what you strawmanned me saying but that‚Äôs not what I said, I‚Äôm just annoyed that if a youtuber says something it‚Äôs taken as fucking gospel
---
Wealthy?  It cost 5 dollars, if you can't afford that you shouldn't be gaming....you should be at work
---
Idk then
---
I hope this becomes a game mode
---
That's what's great about having choice. if you'd rather not use it then you don't have to. I just don't really like the look of cloaks and I like seeing the beautiful designs on a lot of armour that they cover up. :D
---
An update to this I've bought the season pass and after a day of grinding I'm at tier 61 omegalul xD had a lot of fun doing Vex stuff tho and I managed to get my hunter and Titan accts which I've never touched to PL 950 and 951 through the season pass drops so that's a huge bonus :&gt;
---
Wow that is pretty next level. And I thought I played a lot with 700 hours in one yearüòÖ
---
Yes. I UNDERSTAND THIS YOU FOOL. I‚Äôm not gaining progress. How hard is it for your tiny minds to comprehend that perhaps I know how it works after getting to 79%?
---
230 hours in now since new light launched, saving up for the DLCs
---
Yeah, I've had some friends complain it doesn't have the same charm as Destiny 1 (never played that) but honestly I love the freedom it gives you, I have no idea what their talking about.
---
The radar showing you surrounded is the best part
---
Yes well I'm sure not everyone can work super long hours as a student and you know not many have high paying jobs with disposable income you don't know dude
---
it‚Äôs not even a good roll... and you have 8500 kills
---
It seems like easy thing to fix, what the hell are they doing?
---
I'd like more scarf-like cloaks. Even if they make them into Ornaments.
---
Bro just stop
---
No like the rest of the planet I want you to make a logical argument based on reason and or factual references and stick to it
---
For example mine is the chaperone like all shotguns takes no skill and my evidence for it is the power of shotguns in all high mobility shooters alongside the superbly easy nature of hitting headshots with precision weapons especially at close range capped off with the map design in this game not being built with shotguns in mind due to the nature of its launch combo‚Äôd with the radar that makes looking at your screen almost irrelevant compared. 
---
I‚Äôm open to being challenged and proven wrong by an objective standard 
---
There‚Äôs a cancer in modern discussion where people waive shit off and it‚Äôs stupid
---
This is too true. I pre-ordered it on ps4 but stopped playing after a few weeks. Found out it was free on steam and now have over 100 hours
---
Talk about evidence
---
Dude I love to hear this stuff
---
That was the first thought when I saw this. lol.
---
Its 5 dollars, most people spend that on morning coffee.  Sorry that you are struggling, it will get better.
---
Gogogo armchair warrior. Boo, you suck.
---
Nice work hunter
---
Nothing
---
Agreed but I never said they aren‚Äôt over powered
---
Yeah I did things like zero hour and thorn strike with randos, I just haven‚Äôt found the courage to do a raid yet. On the other side, it does feel pretty good to solo the dungeon or nightfalls. It always gives me a sort of thrill.
---
Ok you‚Äôre 12 and don‚Äôt understand logical discussion, please pay attention in class and get off reddit
---
&gt;  in games like destiny
---
any chance you had some software installed from cheating in other games then? sorry if i'm misinterpreting but your commas are weird
---
He'll start at 750, and you're free to just hop into all of the new content. I didn't even bother running the campaigns again when I made my 3rd character considering they removed the Exotic drop at the end of the Red War.
---
Weird thing to call Uldren, gotta say
---
In the original lore the shattered throne came every third week when the curse is at its max but the guy soloed it in the first curse week so the you just have to what babe
---
I never said you said that, it‚Äôs my statement that shotguns in general are baby weapons that allow dumber players to reach ranks that should be reserved for actual skill rather than the ability to press the sprint button, crouch button, and primary fire
---
250 here...send help pls
---
Exactly what happened to me.
---
Tomorrow. Use Google or something.

Wrong sav, that's uncle sav

Ok, cool anecdote, and?

You better not, ‚Äúchild support is a mothafucka ya dig?‚Äù

Its still possible sometimes will happen when its on full curse in the dreaming city
---
Same... currently on 380 hours since steam launch.
---
No one on this sub can help you.
---
Did you contact Bungie?
---
Try posting on r/DestinyTheGame
---
Imagine we find it in the deepstone crypt
---
I think when Last Wish was first beaten, the people over at bungie had to manually start the curse (probably because the game isn't designed to change the maps due to a single fireteam). Maybe it's the same thing here; the problem isn't the game not changing, but rather that bungie didn't change the game
---
Cheating the system and cheating are not the same thing. Your acting like a child throughout this whole conversation and your objectively wrong, drop it.
---
NEEDS MORE SHOUTING!
---
Nope she is gone.
---
Give it a few days when the casual pvpers are done with their quests and bounties and hightail it out of there. Then the stomping teams are all that‚Äôs left
---
What person sees a titan bubble with 3 dead teammates in it and runs in anyways?
---
in all honesty this depends on the context i usually actually spam click aswell when i'm dealing with hordes or multiple enemies cause its easier to delay your shots if needed to not miss and waste a bullet (considering it only has 8) however if i'm fighting a large boss or anything like a single tough enemy i will usually hold down the mouse button sometimes though i will still spam click because A. it feels more like a handcannon to me when your clicking each shot and B. it is easier to get critical damage cause there i less recoil when spamming instead of holding down. also with the catalyst (hopefully) coming soon which will add the ability "high noon" (Hmmmm wonder where they got that from) "high noon" makes it so after pulling the last word out it will do more critical damage for a short time although this is kinda a "meh" ability it actually could be very useful however it is hard to hit constant crit shots while holding down the trigger cause , again , it has more recoil while holding it down so yeah i prefer to spam click most of the time and i cant wait for that catalyst. Thanks for coming to my TedTalk

Run discipline armor with the new artifact mod oppressive darkness
---
This comment deserves more attention. I rest my case
---
I got all other crucible weapons at the next of last season, the recluse was annoying for me to get but I just got Luna's and working on Randy's and NF
---
What does it say that you got banned for. Also did you have the discord on?
---
Since when does it show your gear power+ artifact power underneath the combined power?
---
Oof
---
Should apply to the entire body, but why bother going for body shots with the thing when the value is so high.
---
What does tfw mean?

The dreaming city vendor girl?
---
Nicely done. Thank you for the pointers.
---
You should have read the comments by players who were away from home the weekend Xur was selling Gjallarhorn, in D1. They drove back home from vacations to get it, some instructed a buddy on how to break into their house to get it for them. Total madness.
---
The face when
---
I'm more fortunate but some others will be living paycheck to paycheck is what I'm on about plus I take my names seriously
---
i literally have no idea but those 520 hours have all been while actually playing i might test this idk
---
Its not that bad lol
---
It told you what the ban was for, you just ignored it. Enter a support ticket with Bungie and see what's going on. We can't help you here, and we have no sympathy. 9/10 times scenarios like this have something major left out, and that's the cause of the ban.

Not sure if this still applies, but I got mine as part of a quest line from the Red War campaign (base game). You go through Red War, get to Nessus, do a bunch of quests there (not sure which ones specifically), and get the Drang, which is a legendary sidearm. From there you talk to the Cryptarch and he will kick off the quest to get Sturm.
---
Indeed
---
I can't understand where to write them
---
Your going to need a Guardian first.
---
I don‚Äôt understand why you think this sub can help you instead of contacting Bungo tbh.
---
Nice man! I sat down on Sunday and ground out Randy‚Äôs in a good 3-4 hours with Momentum Control. The easiest part was hitting 2,100 glory lol. The medals took the longest for me personally. 
---
Luna‚Äôs and NF are actually both still great on console tbh.
---
Yeah I won five matches yesterday at 950. And I‚Äôm terrible as it is
---
Nah, that‚Äôs Petra.
---
Simple answer is most likely no one answering you here works at bungie if you have to download a update I'd still check reddit / official bungie sites before popping pinicals because bungie tend to fuc up even the simplest things exp izanagis quest being broken for least month now.
---
If you DM me your friend code I‚Äôm always looking for people to play with. My current clan is almost exclusively on PS4 but I made the change back when cross change came up so I mostly play solo or with my brother only.

When Bungie went and made Halo, the game completely changed the landscape of gaming with it's fair but challenging gunplay. The only thing most of the time determining whether you get killed or not was the amount of skill you had compared to the enemy. If you got killed by a shotgun, then most likely it was because you were too careless and allowed that one guy to get close to you. If you got shot from across the map by a sniper rifle, well it was probably because you were standing out in the open or in an exposed position. If you turned a corner and got blasted by a tank...well that was just you getting really unlucky. Sure this doesn't apply to every kill in the Bungie Halo games, and at times it could feel like bs, but overall halo PVP was more skilled focused than anything else. So you would think Bungie would apply what they learned from Halo and make Destiny's PVP even greater... but no. From day 1 of Destiny, Bungie has struggled to balance their game, with weapons like the Queen Breaker and the Thorn dominating the PVP of D1 and weapons like Uriel's gift and the Lord of Wolves being literally the only weapons you would see in D2 PVP. Now admittedly Bungie adding perk rng to the game means that balancing the gunplay is that much harder and I would understand if the PVP was a bit unbalanced due to that, but quite frankly the state of d2 PVP is inexcusable. Not since the early days of wee old teenage me playing Overwatch and getting hooked by Roadhog from across the map have I burst so many blood veins from getting killed by the same damn guns over and over and over again. If any of you have played a single match of destiny 2 PVP then you know what guns I'm talking about. Recluse, Mountain top, mind benders ambition, Mida Multi-tool, and the last word (bonus points if it's a titan rocking any of these guns while wearing the one-eyed mask). Now quite frankly I'm willing to give the last word, Mida, and Mind bender's ambition some leeway because they're either exotics you have to grind to get or Nightfall exclusives you have to grind for, but I can give absolutely no leeway when talking about the damn recluse and mountain top. Both these, quite frankly, completely broken and overpowered guns, despite being supposedly "hard to get pinnacle guns", are so common to see in the crucible that I'm mathematically sure that at least one out of every two matches will have at least 2 players on the opposing team using one of, if not both, of these guns (that or I have ungodly back luck in matchmaking). At several points whereby all accounts I should have killed the enemy, they go out and either guns me down with their recluse or one-shot me with their mountaintop. And before anyone tries to retort by saying "well the gun is just doing its job", I retort by saying there is a massive difference between a gun doing its job and a gun just overcompensating for the user's skill. The Mida, despite being infuriating to fight against, is doing its job by being a multi-purpose tool that both allows the user to still see enemies while aiming down the sights and thus predict where the enemy is going to come from even while in the heat of battle. The Last word is doing its job by being a last resort powerful hip fire gun for snipers or otherwise long-range players. While I get a bit angry when I'm killed by those two guns, I at the same time can't say the guns aren't doing their jobs well, and at the same time, I can find ways to outplay people who use those guns. But when I go against a recluse Mountaintop player, the only way I can consistently get kills from them is by sticking close to my team and forcing those players to fight me in a 3v1 fight or hardscope snipe them from across the map. I shouldn't be forced to do this just to counter one or two players using a specific gun. All this highlights the glaring issue with destiny 1 and 2 PVP, that being the overreliance on weapons/weapon perks over actual skill. Now sure I bet some god-like players out there would kick the crap out of a recluse mountaintop spamming player, but for an average player like me who wants to just casually play the game for fun, I don't stand a chance against those players unless I cave in and become as try hardy as them.  Now I wouldn't be ranting about all this if I didn't have a solution in mind to fix the current state of the game and stop future guns from becoming the "op meta" guns. The fix I propose is for Bungie to look at take every gun and essentially create a PvE and PVP version for the gun. What I mean by this is that when you would go to examine a gun to look at/change the rolls of the gun, there would be a prompt at the upper right-hand corner of the screen to switch from the PvE rolls to the PVP rolls, with the PvE version having the perks (potentially giving all guns three perks instead of two), and the PVP version not having perks but instead having more options to change the barrels, sights, and magazines/batteries. This way guns like the mountaintop would require actual skill to use and make guns like the recluse...actually to be honest the only way I can see the recluse being balanced would be by lowering its range, stability, handling, and recoil direction. Now note I am not a PVP expert and for all, I know everything I just said would break the entirety of Destiny 2, so I would appreciate people talking to me about all of this and discussing a possible compromise or different solution to solve destiny's problem with op guns.

Yeah fuck if I know I only paid attention to one mission and that's the prison mission

---
You mean the exotic which adds watermelon-sized shoulders to your thin hunter?
---
I have a female awoken hunter. This exotic is the worst looking armor in the entire game.
---
I can't find where their supply
---
Yeah, but better to find out this way. For the HC and bows, the splash damage and poison wouldn't count for the precision kills needed either. I'm going to work on grinding Undying before the season is up. Just need the Vex Offensive triumphs and to do a nighfall on master difficulty.
---
Its fine. I played the last one when I was freshly off the crosssave boat. It was fine. I like crucible anyways, so I'm used to it. I was way under 900 last time, and most people were 930-940. 
---
Its not as bad as you are making it out, you are either bad as crucible or never played iron banner before.
---
Ah thank you. That clarifies it
---
Can confirm. Fire burns. Still punched.
---
Wait that was obtainable
---
There's the Destiny 2 app on iOS/Android as well as a LFG Discord for Steam users.
---
I was in the railroad for about 7 months lol getting settled back into society lol
---
You must be silenced
---
1 hit meele is really fun huh?
---
OOF
---
I got it in Forsaken and I'm still working on a couple catalysts.. I keep forgetting about Wordline since it takes literally 5 weeks, I am not motivated to do Whispers anymore, SUROS Regime and Vigilance Wing I'm sort of doing in the new mode, and I still need to work on Rat King and get Hard Lights. And only spent $20 on Silver.
---
What I've understand: W am Savathun fulfilled m delighted g expectant 104
---
I had a dream. I haven't seriously though about D1 in forever and had a dream that No Land was making a return. It must happen.
---
In D1 yeah. &gt;:)
---
just get closer bro
---
Are you using the right weapon ?
---
Me: Did you try warframe?
---
Also me: Bought all destiny DLCs and playing in free time.
---
Luck. I've got 2 so far but only stumbled into someone else fighting them. I can't solo them either.
---
I use double autos sometimes. Nothing more spectacular than using dragonfly on one and kill clip on the other. Pure hatred üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
I‚Äôve started playing as a hunter about 3 weeks ago. I‚Äôve always been a titan since D1 came out. I admit I love playing as a hunter but I‚Äôm a titan at heart and sometimes I try to do titan shit with a hunter lol
---
Following
---
Smugglers word is pretty nasty in crucible with a good roll. Mine with ricochet, quick draw, and kill clip does work.
---
You missed the clan banner
---
We‚Äôve seen some of Xivu ‚Äòs top people  around the dreaming city.  Just nothing actually from her yet.
---
In what way is sturm a revolver?
---
finished with a full super an your bubble is still up in the background plus you've got wendigo on that is a GG must have been raining orbs
---
I swear to god I have epilepsy because I have played Destiny 2 too much
---
I just started playing last week and went from 750 to 951 and all I have done is stuff on planets, daily/weekly bounties, and some strikes. Getting around 920 and you will start gaining levels more quickly. I was stuck in this range and as soon as I hit around 920 I started gaining levels quickly and was in the 940 range. The 950 weapon from haunted forest is a big help.
---
Even at 950 I am considerably weaker than just about every other guardian that is playing and I don't know why. They kill shit in like 2 hits and I unload multiple clips and they still have 75% health.
---
The lore also states that everything in that lorebook is a lie in some form. So you can't take it at face value either. Which is what most people have been doing since the moment it appeared. Hard focused on the beat dul incaru at 999 part and ignored the fact that the entire book is full of misdirection, false information and contradictions on purpose.
---
Are you being for real?
---
Thank you thank you for heads up.
---
People just took advantage of that mode to grind Jade Rabbit catalyst.
---
yeah but doesent realy work out for me.
---
And i dont like the idea to get all my stacks and the switch weapons and shoot with the shotgun...
---
it gets to complicated for me in the heat of the battlefield.
---
And i dont have the shotgun.
---
I dont get it everyone goes on about mountaintop, but everytime I pull it out to see what's so special it almost never one shots anyone. I've seen in do various damage from one shot, to being hit by a slightly toasted marshmallow. Am I just ass with it or what's going on?
---
Well, that's actually a good idea, but very rapidly there will be someone else who does use them and ruins the experience.
---
Oh, thanks
---
Also try it with Ace of Spades and its catalyst for even more explosion fun.
---
He wasn't sniped, he was killed by a Fist of Havoc. See above comments.
---
Full credit to my team, I just had the clutch invade
---
Very true
---
Forges don‚Äôt have any powerful drops anymore. 
---
For you, you are basically looking at the strike playlist (3 strike with matching element), gambit, fixed crucible playlist and rotating crucible playlist as well as zavala, banshee, drifter and shaxx challenges for doing 8 of their bounties. 
---
Then the weekly clan XP challenge, flashpoint and prime engrams.
---
Can also do the haunted forest challenges and the iron banner bounties while they are around. 
---
That pinnacle drop update tomorrow does not affect you until you are 950+. 
---
Either way, that‚Äôs lots of drop sources for powerfuls to capitalize on and raise your power far more than you have been. Doing multiple characters would also help quite a bit.
---
raids, BITCH.
---
It's fairly common. You were lucky to get it the very next match. Normally it might have been your 20-30th match.
---
Ah sorry then only on PC but if you transfer to PC you can always hmu anytime
---
And your reward: a bug out bag
---
Every game does this üòÇ this isn‚Äôt new
---
My hunter used to look exactly like this way back in forsaken (except the cloak)
---
Finally :D

:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D

2100 takes literally no skill now as you will be dragged to it with 15-20% winrate in one evening.:D

Also Rule #11:  No loot posts

Keep  all loot/achievement posts to the end of the week thread for them. This  includes 'should I keep this roll' or 'is this roll good' posts. Those  belong in [r/sharditkeepit](https://www.reddit.com/r/sharditkeepit).  
---
Welcome to the sub.
---
I just want good characters to start replacing them. Where is the new Hunter Vanguard that‚Äôs written really well?? Not in the tower. That‚Äôs for sure! Or maybe a well written speaker!?
---
By the Architects
---
It makes perfect sense. Don't play what you do not enjoy.
---
By riding a sparrow in a raid.
---
I also got it on my next crucible match and I think my brother is in the same case
---
(:
---
Facts that‚Äôs the best way
---
Damn. You didn‚Äôt need to throw her off Mercury to burn her...
---
In D2 or just Shadowkeep?
---
Been there sense d1 so i can‚Äôt really say another about this...but uh...fun gams
---
The grammar lol am I wrong when I say the ‚Äú?‚Äù Shouldn‚Äôt be there
---
This is what a 100 intellect Titan looks like.
---
How do I get it?
---
Yeah, havent seen any gameplay and i wanted to give it a shot but cant. I was planning on a hard disk but idk
---
Bungies servers are shit. They were shit in D1, shit on Bnet and now shit on Steam. I get disconnected all the time from this shit game but never from any other game, ever. Not your fault
---
I had a similar situation as the titan. Got everyone in a corner with emotes then slammed them all. Knew I wasn‚Äôt going to win so I just sat there and let them shoot me after my super finished. It was too tempting....
---
The message being conveyed Yea I totally agree
---
i just wanna know if all ornaments drop no matter the season.
---
i enjoy this game cause it helped me move on from overwatch.
---
Bottom tree hammer is an amazing class for damage/support with the new Shadowkeep exotic leg armor. Also bubble with helm of saint 14 is a really good way to buff you and your team for raids
---
It's called paragraphs, learn to use them.
---
Not is savathum has anything to say about it!
---
Indubitably
---
since destiny 2 was on steam if thats what you meant (i have more than that overall including battle net)
---
Just wait for them to kill off Devrim and make a long boring quest that requires you to run around the whole earth doing fetch quests
---
My brother always complained about this.
---
So I tried his favourite game, forza. That's got one.
---
GTA has it.
---
Skyrim too.
---
What you are experiencing is "conformation bias". That particular screen annoys you. But you're forgetting all the ones that didn't.
---
Oh okay, that's more hardcore. Congrats!
---
Excuses are like buttholes.  Everyone has one and they all stink.
---
Good for purchasing Vex Milk /s
---
Where the fuck did any of that happen. You kept denying OPs facts. Plain as day
---
Thanks for the info, I'll probably go for recluse next.
---
Alright thanks!
---
Thanks for the tips.
---
&gt;was
---
*Indeed.*
---
Yeah it was a joke lol
---
There is no fact that doing this will work, it‚Äôs only speculation based off one line from a book about lies
---
Also I don‚Äôt know if you actually...read...but there‚Äôs plenty of people saying I said x when I didn‚Äôt, at least with one of them you can misinterpret it understandably but the rest are just fucking stupid
---
It‚Äôs as plain as a deluxe burger you fool
---
Time of day is important too.  I‚Äôm straight up trash at PvP (less than 1.0 KD) and I got to Fabled in an early afternoon session - @1-4pm.  From @500 points up to 2100.  Maybe got lucky, or maybe wasn‚Äôt matching all the kids who were still in school
---
It‚Äôs definitely the best invading super
---
All Snipers use special (green) ammo, except Heavy exotic snipers use heavy(purple) ammo
---
ok boomer
---
I mean yeah
---
It‚Äôs busted
---
I bought Destiny 1 and every single DLC at time of release, then I had to wait years before I got Destiny 2 for free I want some sort of compensation!
---
/s
---
You cornered him and he felt unsafe. A natural reaction of our species.
---
I did the totems with crimson, raid sniper and wendigo.
---
Boss with tranquility, recluse and whisper.
---
The best tip for the totem part is just keep jumping and kill at least 1 knight quick.
---
I just bought Shadowkeep and Forsaken this week after joining up with New Light. 
---
Freaking love it so far, have an amazing clan that I play with all the time, ***SO MUCH FREAKING CONTENT OMG***. My quest log is brimming with story lines and exotic quests, I barely start any of them before Iron Banner or Festival of the Lost comes out. 
---
GODDAMNIT BUNGIE I CAN'T PLAY YOUR GAME BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY NEW THINGS TO PLAY IN YOUR GAME
---
But you don't grind/farm for primes. They're just random drops I thought?
---
1920x1080
---
Boomer and proud.
---
Hehe nice one
---
I bet it was.
---
My cousin introduced me to destiny1 way back when.  It wasnt long before I started sherpa'ing him and his friends (who became my friends) Now I'm pretty much the last one who plays it trying to do as much as I can solo.  Gotta say, something about the grind just keeps me going.
---
Are you referring to PvP?  Bungie does try to Nerf and buff guns to keep everything as viable as possible, but certain Pinnacle guns and exotics will generally rise above the rest
---
They said they would announce when it would go live. May be later in the day per that tweet.
---
awww the days of Auto Rifles destroying everything.  You know if you look at it the crucible gun meta really has followed D1 meta stroke for stroke over the years.
---
What happened?
---
Ok thank you
---
Got it
---
*trumpet noise*
---
I just hit 961 yesterday when someone make 999 XD
---
Hmm, very well, I acquiesce your point, at any rate, the core of the build, the anti-barrier rounds combined with breach refractor and Nezerec plus Recluse and whatever demolitionsist primary you want remains an extremely viable build. Wether you go for a heavy farming build or a debuff machine is really up to you, both routes are good and with the rest, guarenteed to cause some carnage üôÇ
---
I hope never. Crucible is already broken, don't wish it worse.
---
It really was. Especially because I could no-life that shit every day for the most part. I actually kind of credit D1 for saving my life. It was the most addictive thing I'd ever come into contact with, which says a lot.. it
---
saw me through the Darkness and brought me into the Light. (See what I did there?) Renewed my love of gaming, too!
---
Maybe he didn‚Äôt claim it once he made that new characer
---
Jade rabbit sparrow confirmed?
---
Whatever you want!  If you like story then go to Amanda Holliday in the hangar and do the Y1 story missions.  Otherwise you can really do whatever you like, Crucible for PvP, Strikes are like mini-dungeon/raids, and Gambit is a PvPvE game mode.
---
Everything you do will drop gear up to lvl 900 which at that point will allow you to start doing certain activities for "powerful" gear to level you up to 950.
---
It did come back it is called the arbalest now
---
I got Bygones, Trust, and 2 misfits in one day
---
I think that was extremely intentional
---
when you get the additional drops from crucible/gambit matches it drops at 750, same with pluperfect and the seasonal armor, its just pretty rare.
---
Quest idea: devrim wants to award you for your triumphs as a guardian, but wants to give you a final trial.  After completing the trial he gives you the sniper as a final ‚Äúgift‚Äù along with some tea.
---
what? mine have always counted for the quest
---
