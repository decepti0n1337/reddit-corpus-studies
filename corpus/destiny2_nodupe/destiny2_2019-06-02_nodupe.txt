You aren't the only one I haven't done any of the things that require a fireteam to do them
---

---
No loa no rat king etc.
---
---
---
Are they nerfing it?
---
Can't go wrong with either really. Just depends who you are up against enemy wise. I'll be using my recluse and have a couple trench barrel shottys in the wings just in case.

---
No don't be the guy with nine captures which caused his team to lose
---
Well that's a dumb fuckin rule.
---
A lot of people don't like to use that one in pvp very much because they'd rather use longer range shotguns. It's only really "meta" in pve. Of course, it totally works in pvp as well, but it's better in pve than pvp.
---
I tried getting a good bone structure but I am torn between banshee packs and mod components :(
---
Or any exotics
---
That and Trench Barrel rapid fire frames.
---
I don’t see why not. Y3 announce could be a return to the Dreadnaught, or Enceladus which is a moon around Saturn and has lots of lore references.
---
Retold tale??

That list you have is different from what I'm seeing from charlemagne now. Today is this:

---
Yes I'm aware that its different. I used that to help, everything else was just general knowledge of the game, listing some additionally particularly viable options.
---
 Are u in a fireteam?
---
I would love it to come back, but the super regen doesn't need to be a thing tbh. Just bring String of Curses but make the damage boost stack like Rampage, or add an effect to it while taking away the super regen.
---
*deflect*
---
Retro-Grade TG2 shares the same model.
---
I’ve been pretty lucky in my last 3-4k hours of it and Destiny 1. I guess you can say my *destiny* was predetermined
---
In-game it felt like... f-o-r-e-v-e-r.
---
But.. we won. I lead the team with 26 defeats (most on the team),  21 of those actual kills.
---
You can always sand it. On a piece this size, it would be an enormous amount of work though.
---
It doesn't mean its viable compared to guns just bc of one game
---
Your right. But guess what: it still did good for that one game.
---
Nah I meant all the exotic armors that are getting nerfed.
---
You can buy things, you know.  
---
Can you lend?  Asking for a friend.
---
You forgot praetorian foil
---
From a distance you look like a shiny devil trigger dante
---
All I can imagine with that name is some guy running nude across a frozen lake.
---
Goddamn dude. Simmer the fuck down. Scroll past the post if you’re not interested in it
---
Yeah but they skipped the whole season so no arbalest for them
---
You*. Sorry
---
Do you wanna talk?
---
Bannerfall
---
Bravo! I had to have a fireteam and we died even then.
---
Spread across the US.. Mostly central and mountain, but a few people outside of that
---
his horn is even more glorious
---
As someone who drank heavily tonight and was full. I can now drink more. Thank you comrade
---
Not true anymore, aggressives and precisions have around the same OHK range and aggressives have more impact, in fact he last man standing with one-two punch can shut down supers because of its high impacts. The only problem with aggressives is that they have a lower RPM, but if you get a kill with one then their RPM increases.
---
Should’ve screamed yeet the whole way down
---
Good bone structure is a slug shotgun like chaperone, so to kill with it you need to always hit the head.
---
^yes
---
I actually didn't know, appreciate the PSA fellow space zombie. I have the gun but still, appreciate it
---
The leviathan gobbles up planets. Then again, you are able to see the dreadnaught in saturn’s rings from a very large distance. Leviathan is probably bigger though.
---
I got it three times from resetting valor rank.
---
So, what's your theory on Savathun, except more details please this time?
---
Also, you can pm me and I'll get back to you soon with anything I can offer in terms of advice on more serious stuff.
---
As a titan i welcome you to our ranks scrawny guardian.
---
Punch hard and proud, but most of all, punch everything.
---
Emotes my man. Usually drop from eververse packages or you can buy them when they pop up into rotation.
---
You ended this gif too soon
---
Thank you!!!
---
Hey, about the NF/Luna’s I just would like to say if you have never tried it try out a 110 rom hand cannon like duke mk44 with rampage though you likely won’t win an initial duel if you get a kill with it it goes to a 2 tap and has much more range than Luna’s and a little bit more than NF good luck and have fun though
---
Thank you!!!!!!
---
You threaded tf outta that needle lol.
---
We can’t do anything in PvE. At least let us have something
---
When did yeet become popular to say? Like what word did it replace that was the popular cringe word younger kids said? Yolo maybe?
---
F
---
 [The new Pinnacle sniper is already in the game.](https://i.imgur.com/SExqWzO.png)
---
While I like the ideas, though I admit they could use some fleshing out, there would have to be a massive retcon of Destiny lore to accommodate. 
---
That's a d3 thing. Discovery of a lost branch of the Light. Have Uldren be the quest hub; make him win your trust while you win his. His time with the coldness of the Void, yadda yadda. Maybe expansion 1 d3; I'm super curious what's in store if and when D3 turns out to be more than vaperware. (doubtful). Bungie has the wheel; let's see how they drive with SoO next week.
---
I know I'm going to get downvotes for this, but I see a fair few people complaining that striker super is lasting too long, but I swear spectral blades (with and without Gwisin Vest) had equal or less charge drain?
---
The game doesn't like it when you land on top of those fallen ships and try to ride around on them.
---
Damn!
---
That's a good point if multiple people are new to it lol.
---
I finally got my warlock up to speed. After the first talisman quest, the next two or three just popped up completed. I’m not complaining.
---
Congrats you got 40 kills but didn't bother to capture a single objective....
---
Both amazing in pvp and pve. Checks out.
---
Gimme those cores
---
It’s a meme. Doesn’t need to actually correlate
---
I hear this long chain of f as the sound of the golden gun shot by that gunsliger. F
---
True dedication. I wish I had the motivation and friends to finish all those badges. I plan to go for the Dredgen Title next season and possibly Cursebreaker.
---
I'd uninstall if i was that hunter.
---
Good point
---
Yeah man that dude on your team with only 2.097 score..
---
I have 4 titles. Wayfarer is easy but a grind. Dredgen takes a bit of skill. Cursebreaker is a bit of dedication and time but it's one of the coolest sounding titles. The title that I always wanted was Rivensbane. I lost all my shit when I finally had the sparrow drop for me. It's really rewarding.
---
I can't even get them to drop in EP and this dude is getting it in Gambit too
---
This is quite interesting. One would assume it would be divided evenly; three guns in the Energy slot loot pool =~33% drop rate? However, I've only gotten two guns, compared to numerous amounts of scouts/shotguns. Although, I guess that could be shitty RNG as well.
---
It's a good advice, and might be easily overlooked.
---
Free legendary shards
---
If you consider it a pve gun, smoothbore is fine. Obviously not great in pvp, but range won't be an issue in pve.
---
You're finding lfg groups for PC? Only thing I've been able to find are console grouos. I had figured raiding was all just done in clans.
---
It’s ridiculous how long this super lasts. Bungie literally nerfed arc blade so long ago so that people wouldn’t use it to move around faster and now this
---
That’s the curated roll. If it drops masterworked (curated) it will always have the same perks.
---
Legs with gun
---
Prestige SOS boss encounter in a nutshell.
---
Oh yeah I’ve done that too a couple times actually, and I shit you not it gave me a piece of armour this week. Unbelievable shit man...
---
Try Prestige version and everyone looks like they're "new people".
---
It's brutal and it's a shame how quick people give up, because i like a good challenge in PvE.
---
Ones when i was doing last wish we got almost to riven (Random fireteam btw) the game went to maintnense
---
companion app will not connect on my mobile data connection - so its not my internet connection

---
I found the same thing a couple days ago. Was waiting for the +*%# ether harvest event to start, a powerful enemy spawned right around that area. Killed it, got the talisman completed.
---
¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
I only seem to get those teammates when I have 20 motes
---
Well hypothetically, if you 'try' prestige, I'd assume you're a first timer. I think it's a great thing that people come together to do the same thing out of different interests. Although a lot of people don't realize it.
---
I've actually found code of the missile to have worn out on me. The most fun is the melee but to get the most out of it I need Skullfort, then hope my allies don't kill my target mid jump because they don't see me. The last upgrade in the tree also sees little to 0 use with how long the buff lasts and that I need to run to get ammo. 
---
Meanwhile top tree arcstrider gets my dream of lightning punches with basically 0 downtime built into the tree, leaving the exotic slot wide open.
---
Why are you on here than?
---
Good question. Try it out i guess
---
This happened to me when my clan were doing a drunk raid. Rules were if you had someone drop out, you weren’t allowed to replace them, and they couldn’t join back. 
---
Basically, we tried to 5 man Calus while extremely drunk (from about the 7 hour mark) - we kept dying and having to drink. Got to 10 hours and people started dropping off, leaving me, in a drunken mess trying to band together a new group to run through the raid
---
It requires skill not to kill myself with it
---
Then don't aim at the floor XD
---
Well there are always Spectral Blades available to use.
---
Time to close this thread, my main point was just that almost every super is viable as I see all of them being used. And that abilities are fine especially smoke in top and middle tree nightstalker where you can do the wombo combo tactic and secure yourself at least one kill.
---
That was all she wrote.
---
Was over a year ago (found a huge cache of old footage) but if I recall correctly, the Atalanta-D (I believe). The only sub I remember with that kind of suppressor. They actually brought it back for Forge as Black Armory Atalanta-D XG1992. ([Bungie.net](https://Bungie.net) seems to be down right now so can't link out to [light.gg](https://light.gg) to send ya.)

r/destinydadjokes
---
&gt;Wolves is great for this, I smashed
---
yea gonan try that one when the games get stable with servers
---
One console 180 HC are a must if you are going with HC, and you can play with a snipe if you are good. But if not, the ol' reliable: shotguns are your thing then. But make sure to play some quick ay before you jump into comp
---
It's been working so hard on matchmaking it's having a meltdown
---
This happened to my brother a few weeks ago on Nessus while doing a forge as well
---
doesn‘t make it easier killing the walkers or the servitors
---
Haha I never fly off the map just at the wall at 100mph
---
Oh yes, all of my memes must definitely make perfect sense in accordance with the Marvel timeline for me to find them funny
---
Is that where you get killed by The Architects? They need firing!
---
Is this where Pete Parsons posts "whoa look out apparently there's a subreddit for Destiny blender porn!" that he actually made himself?
---
Well that's kinda the whole point. I love to play hunter in pve, it's very fun. The roll is usefull for dodging, the knives can actually hit something, etc. But it sucks when i want to play crucible and i'm full hp one-shotted by titan or warlock melee.
---
The full vid is awesome! I kinda want to make a meme-y reaction image of the frame where she's looking down at the exotic engram haha
---
Is it really a flex seal product if it doesn't work under under water? I feel that's part of the criteria.
---
I think Byf put that out before the raid emblem came out though. Raid emblem has a Hive feel with a Vex hydra outline and vex hydra tentacles on it.
---
Also makes logical sense because if Quria dies, Savathun no longer has the ability to take and will need to go to the dreadnaught for the tablets of ruin. This is significant because the dreadnaught is the location of the next expansion.
---
As well, with whispers being heard through out the game near high-tech areas, maybe Quria is trying to speak to us?
---
There’s a lot of speculation, but there’s more speculation for Quria than anyone else
---
Oh I have I burst glide
---
Haha wow :'D
---
Y'all not double tapping fast enough. If you do, Warlocks can reach anywhere. Literally double tap as far as possible to reach maximum height. I'm not understanding why people are having trouble. If you need to corner, use the glide that allows maneuverability.
---
I got masterwork threat level 2nd try
---
I was at mythic 3 and just soloed
---
Im thinking 13 hours i think
---
Wow, that was a really lore-heavy response. Nice, but I actually didn’t know about the whispers in high-tech areas. Granted I do more PvP than PvE but I watch Byf/Myelin. I definitely would not mind fighting Quria I just don’t want it to be a boring fight. I want Bungie to be clever with this entire raid. No bugs, no glitches, just a really intense raid that requires on the fly thinking
---
This is has almost no movement and it includes only one character. Also you don’t know how much time this guy spent on making this, and D2 cutscenes are really good
---
Yes lol, it doesn't go away. Your gambit rank will be set to 0 at the start of a new season, though. 
---
You can tell if things require the annual pass by whether or not you can access the activities they come from. Since 21% Delirium doesn't require anything specific to gambit prime, just normal gambit, you can get it. 
---
[A list of everything that disappears when the new season starts](https://old.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/bp0vzv/a_list_of_everything_disappearing_when_the_new/)

Like how the dlc looked, then in true bungie fashion they let you down again. Why must we repeat old content again to get the new content. ive played the old stuff hundreds of times and im ready to play the new. plz stop this, i know making content is hard for you but this repeat of the old stuff is getting ridiculous
---
Was half expecting him to do the default dance
---
I will do in the future
---
I ROLLED, Blac Youngsta is always cracking me the fuck up. I didn't even see what the secret exotic was.
---
Dude lookin' like Jack from the Tekken franchise
---
Check his comment where he links the full video on YouTube, there is sound :)
---
We had 15 motes and they had a primeval, we shredded it on primeval slayer X2 I swear they gave up when they got their primeval
---
Thank you for the vid. It definitely helps the knowledge part. Now I need to practice implementation.
---
I apologise if you already know this, but just in case, your progress will not reset when the season changes, nor will pinnacle weapons vanish! You have as long as you need to get those last envoy and primeval kills.
---
I don’t enjoy Crucible, but I play it when the reward is powerful gear just for participation. Sticking together with my fire team is definitely something I try to do.
---
Congratulations! Also, what’s that emblem that shows up in recent?
---
This happened to me once, was 1 win away from getting Luna’s. Start raging when I join the match with 3 solos against a 4 stack. Ended up winning countdown 6-0. 
---
Got my Luna’s and got obliterated the next 5 or 6 matches. Thought “this gun is shit” lol

---
Well... Meltdown. A.... Brain meltdown! Get it? 😅
---
Not for Raids and other endgame activities, like I said. We're there to use Sunbreaker's weakening burn melee on bosses and that's it. Most of our abilities are meant for clearing enemies but that can be done by any class with weapons that fit that role :(
---
I don't think that needs a bu- *gets hit by a ricochet shield around 7162387123 corners*
---
Database gets updated
---
It bounces like... 3? 4 times? And it’s about as fast as a geriatric gliding warlock so it’s not really a threat
---
He means does it drop after you unlock it tho, similar to how you have to unlock Redrix, and then it can drop
---
I'm in this photo and I don't like it
---
I think what they could do would be kind of a high damage class for once,the idea would be that the titan boosts himself with ice into the sky then starts dropping freezing explosives,they don't downright kill but if hit they cc you long enough to kill you,if you can't be cc'd you take more damage (some bosses)
---
A bygones with nice rolls is decent in an allrounder role and works fairly well against blockers with a major spec.
---
Downvote me all you want, there’s a reason Hunter dominates high comp on all three platforms. Just because YOU can’t utilize it doesn’t mean it needs buffs.
---
Let's see here (i say this as a warlock main from experience vs them)
---
BB: only kills me when i don't have a super,and even then often enough i live
---
Tether: i can kill them before the tether procs
---
6 shot gg: take cover and wait,then shotgun them cuz they have 0 damage resistance
---
Arc staff: can't chase
---
Spectral: wonky hit reg (had a spectral hit me 6 times and none killed me)
---
Two-Tailed Fox is a... strange choice to lock down your heavy slot + exotic. If you ran something with either more utility [Hammerhead] or more damage [Outrageous Fortune w/ Spikes] you could use Polaris Lance for extreme range or Outbreak Perfected for mid range and both are terrific ad clear.
---
It would also be a good way to wrap up the Cayde storyline, as I can't see them doing it in D3
---
To be fair, the game doesn’t very clearly say how it works. Bungie is under the assumption for some reason that 100% of their player base follows every patch, and this game is casual *enough* that I don’t think that’s a feasible assumption.
---
The standard version of Forsaken, which is $40 USD.
---
Leaked Bungie concept: Heavy Hand Cannon
---
This is on Nessus, right? There are triangles that look like that in an area you go to for the adventure in the Cistern that foreshadows the Leviathan raid. Were you anywhere near that area?
---
PC gamers can just take a screenshot and upload it straight to Reddit. Console gamers have to go through, what, 3 sites or apps, or 2 machines and a usb drive to get something on reddit and you think that’s not penalising console players?
---
And don’t attempt to correct my spelling with your American bastardisation of English. We gave you a language, kindly use it!
---
Screw trying to contribute here, I’ll go back to lurking.
---
Original concept for 1K Voices
---
I read that as "is shaxx fucking a mountain"
---
Huh?
---
Dogs, Axes, Chalice, Sun
---
Oh shit
---
I believe I was in watchers grave and I actually ran into more of those triangle but left because they dropped my frames by a lot
---
I have never heard any one call it “Goblet”
---
What do you mean, all the other DLCs? 
---
The way to purchase all DLC, if you don't have any already, is to buy Forsaken and buy the annual pass. 
---
Forsaken is 100% worth it and comes with the two year 1 DLCs, is this what you mean? The annual pass is three smaller DLCs that just add end game activities, no new campaigns or anything, so whether or not it's worth it is subjective.
---
Finals was 2 weeks ago
---
i mean, he probably has done that before
---
No
---
If both pieces of gear are the same (like infusing a Tigerspite into another Tigerspite) it only costs glimmer.
---
on top(😏) of Queen Mara Sov’s booty call
---
Hmmm
---
I use a Blast Furnace with rampage. You could also use a Go Figure, Bygones, or any other pulse rifle that *is not* a High Impact like Eystein-D. For some reason, those just don't do very good damage in pve.
---
Eyy I also got it today!

Yea you gotta delete this yesterday, this 100% violates this subs anti-witch hunting rule.

I'm guessing that's Xbox?

I just got there too my dude. Glad to finally be part of the club.
---
Once I was in a comp game with a leaver on team. It was match point, my entire team but me got wiped out, and I managed to kill the whole enemy team with a single Blade Barrage to win the game. I was expecting praise, congratulations, anything. But you know what happened? Shaxx said nothing, and it crushed my heart.
---
At that point just fucking give up on challenge mode like for real.
---
Name checks out
---
They might need to. Guardians hunger and get thirsty and can die of starvation (before getting redirected; i.e Drifter), So who’s not to say they might get tired?
---
That sounds suspiciously like "Goblin"
---
Walk carefully, for HE will be watching
---
That particular challenge has just very little room for error. It usually comes done to practice and getting the muscle memory in. I can't remember how long I was in there, but there were probably 4 people that were new to the challenge. And the challenge is what they started the raid for in the first place.
---
Yiiikes
---
You on PS4?
---
Xbox
---
Damn. That sucks. I would've recruited you to mine otherwise.
---
I'd argue the only tree for hunters (that are viable in pvp) which is in a sub-par position, is the 6 shot tether, but it can be used quite effectively.
---
I did the raid for the first time today and was told to say chalice but ended up saying cup when we were done and nobody cared. In fact more people were starting to say cup as we went along
---
Welp that sucks. Thanks for the offer tho
---
How often do you want to raid, what's your class, and how open are you to new people and how patient are you?
---
I’m sad because I got 1k voices on my first last wish
---
Wow rlly good
---
Normally wouldn't go for some Black Templar Armor but that's hot.  Blood Angels Titan Armor and now we're talking.
---
Once you hit max level your experience bar continues to fill.  When you hit a level again you get a bright engram.  The first 3 each week will come pretty quickly.  After that they kinda drag out.
---
You called?
---
You continue to gain levels after hitting the cap. Those levels give you a bright engram, one per level.
---
Levels after cap? Do tell
---
wanna trade?
---
One run, anarchy. Rngesus is fickle.
---
Under collections not the inventory
---
was it a helmet? if not and the armor view is focused on another item, its just preview characters they added into the game to let you view other classes armor.
---
Thx alot
---

Good ol' Lord Fuckwad.

LoW is gonna be even better though?

Idiots who can't understand a lighthearted joke shouldn't be assholes in the internet in the first place!

Duke is my forever favorite gun in the game, I live for those sweet two-taps with rampage
---
My clan also refused gambit as an enjoyable pastime and complained the whole game. I just threw on some tunes and played away
---
Never.
---
This gun is basically krieg from bl2 and thats why i love it
---
Mayhem is by far my favorite game type, is it up right now? I thought it was something else.
---
Don't get me wrong, I want to to win too. But it mainly matters on Legend Rank where you need wins to progress you're rank. Any other time I don't usually care.

Great timing: somebody just posted this link analyzing PvE damage and DPS across weapon categories. Might help you decide what exactly to aim for once you're at the optimizing phase.

Its probably the Dreaming City armor while someone is as ascendant looks pretty cool
---
Is that a lunch box lmao
---
Yeah I was just as shocked lol
---
Lmao this is wild. Slowing it down, you see the shotty put in 4632 damage and then the melee crank out 44119. That combo is gnarly.
---
That sounds, fantastic!
