I just realized the people that stoped playing destiny are the people that died in the red legion attack

You win for the day.

Quickly became my favourite bow. Have fun with her.
---
ooh, very nice :)
---
After

I won't even use shotguns unless they have auto-loader.
---
545 hours on my Hunter, jeez I need to play something else.
---
Top reasons why crossplay isn‚Äôt good 1:
---
the worst part is when you go into comp with all randoms your team regular and the other team is straight wavespliter when you know if they were not using free kill mode you could take them
---
In a way, it‚Äôs kind of like the Dark Souls games. The point at which you stop playing is the point at which your character dies... In a way. 
---
T A H I T I 
---
Ah, thanks!
---
 It a single one 
---
Got another one today
---
I wanna see the lewd side of that pillow

---
Lol, I did the exact same thing. 
---
It would be just like how D2 first came out. When shotguns required heavy ammo...
---
constantly... I travel to the tower... DC... I go to titan... DC... tangled shore? DC... sometimes it doesn't fully DC

I'm in the PNW maybe it's the area I live in? didn't happen until about three days ago
---
This week? Once! 
---
Records lol
---
Thanks man.  I‚Äôve got a friend (maybe two) who would be willing to fill some spots. 
---
Oh wow, I never realised how pretty it looks.
---
I just started forsaken on my first character 
---
‚ÄúMaybe, just maybe, YOU SHOULDVE USED
---
MORE GRENADEs‚Äù
---
Thats a lot of time wasted
---
smart move bud
---
Yeah man absolutely. I know how much of a pain it is, I've had my fair share of douche bag team mates.
---
So I‚Äôm not going to use the meta? I‚Äôm going to hinder myself on purpose when the goal of comp is to win game? Im going to fuck over my own teammates for no good reason? I‚Äôm going to choose a shit grenade over a one shot grenade? Are you this stupid? Again your showing how trash you are.  If I have something in my arsenal to help me win, I‚Äôm going to use it. The thought process behind trash players is mind blowing really. I‚Äôm On Xbox, will 1v1 you only using gunplay, same guns as you. sure it will be more than easy. If it was up to me, this game would have no supers, and the king of good aim wins. 
---
The only frames available from Ada this week are the Pulse Rifle (Blast Furnace - Izanami Forge), the Sword (Strikers Sure Hand - Volundr Forge), and the Machine Gun (Hammerhead - Volundr Forge).  So unfortunately the Hand Cannon and Auto Rifle will have to wait for next week, theoretically.
---
I understand it's just a thought but personally I refuse to get Anthem whether or not it's good not after Mass Effect Andromeda that was a betrayal that I will never forgive. 
---
Tyson dude! I singed out of my psn and signed back in and it worked!
---
*sigh* adults and their responsibilities, amiright
---
I‚Äôm 650 and I‚Äôve never done a raid can u plz carry me? XD id love to do any of them 
---
I see why you chose to show off your subclass.
---
Nice. 
---
Who?
---
I had both and honestly prefered the Outlaw/Rampage roll. Even over the curated one. 
---
*le sighs (in adult)
---
Thats a lot of time played/wasted
---
It would waste more super, but light attacks don‚Äôt take any lol. That was part of the giant buff that made Spectral Blades one of the best PvP supers in the game
---
(Adult detected) SOUND THE REDDIT ALARMS
---
Not yet I'm still running around the island for the first time. 
---
Shoot me a message on PSN and we can try to set up a date and time. Assuming your on PS4. Psn is the same as here.
---
Please no...
---
Unfortunately nobody uses it. They need to just make a basic matchmaking for raids and nightfalls. Not sure why they leave it up to us. Could've spent the time they took to make the fireteam search on The app and just make matchmaking instead. 
---
Please help my dumb ass to get through this glowing wall in destiny 2

You can find this information in either patch notes or the "This Week at Bungie" blog posts.

o ya a 21 kill streak is no big deal lol. you know what? I just logged on I'm on xbox too I'll start up a match. What's your gt
---
üòÇüòÇ ahh kids, they will always be brutally honest to a fault 
---
You and other Sherpas (looking at you /r/DestinySherpa) are real heroes. As someone just getting into D2 raiding (very casually thanks to work and meatspace obligations), y'all make life a lot less stressful. A sincere thank you!
---
Also again please copy and paste where I said telesto is balanced. Bro you are literally the most full of shit, salty little keyboard warrior I've ever seen and it's pretty damn hilarious 
---
Peasants?
---
Your Triumph score needs some work.
---
You're only Top 2%. 
---
This is a amazing!!! It's this done every week? 
---
...which is locked to a completely garbage skill tree. As for Foetracer, you have to shoot them first, and it doesn't grant you the instant full health + overshield that OEM gives you. I also believe the tracking lasts after death too. Basically you're punished for shooting at somebody wearing the OEM, as they can just retreat and easily win the next engagement, and also punishes your teammates if you lose your 1v1. I've played with it and against it, and trust me it's significantly more powerful in Crucible than other exotics.
---
I vote you set is as PS4 background.
---
Yeah never played any of the Mass Effects but saw some funny content about that game, that wouldn't be funny if I'd bought it
---
I actually took this on PC and set it as my PC background :)
---
nah its not that great on pc either as people can snap-180 and shotgun you anyway.
---
http://imgur.com/Qv1W1vV
---
so that's a screenshot of what I actually said, since you seem to just ignore the responsibility of proving what you say is true, so basically at this point we can assume that you know the things you say are fucking stupid but you say them anyways. 
---
I've had 3 of these damn things drop for me. If I get anymore, I'm dismantling them.
---
Also good idea. 4k?
---
My Triumph is not loading here since i have hidden stats, check story, strikes etc... Everything is 0% since the stats are private... Btw the meme is about time spent on D2... Oh well... üòÇ
---
A 21 streak with a gun that beats any other gun that got first shot off isn‚Äôt that hard I can assure you, and you did say it, I read what you wrote, you said exactly this ‚Äúthe Telesto is more balanced than any shotgun in the game, and takes far more skill to use than any shotgun‚Äù that‚Äôs what you wrote, can‚Äôt take it back 
---
Damn!! Now if we had fought him instead of Ghaul things may have turned out a bit differently üòÇ
---
no
---
I had the same happen except the enemy team invaded me and gave me chest bumps 
---
I did verse 7 last week.  It was the last one I needed.
---
I got the shell last week from the ascendant chest, I believe the ship only drop from the shattered throne 
---
I did... yeah guys I‚Äôll run sword... 
---
TY for reply. Bummer, did a bunch of S.T. last week...no ship.
---
*The helmet stayed on*
---
That‚Äôs odd that never happens to me
---
It's been said that getting a high score above certain thresholds (100,000 and 200,000) will increase your chances of getting drops. Theres no way for this to be definitively confirmed though.
---
That last rock he picks up kinda looks like the Traveler 
---
You can one shot body shot in crucible if you have kill clip active!
---
If an item is no longer available, its icon no longer appears in collections. Since these items are required for a title, there is *no way* they will become unobtainable any time soon. 
---
Just start it and people will join. Ive never started solo and not got 2 more. And we finish every time

Yeah, watching a guide on youtube, then just saying you've done it in that case. Or look for a clan that likes helping new people through content.

Oh shoot that was a while ago. I think you have to do a mission on another planet. Earth?
---
Check the other patrol zones for missions,

 might even have to be level 50 and 500 light to continue

Don't tell me you Hunters haven't used your cloak to wipe your ass in emergencies.

I've done it countless times with my mark, it usually gets muddied in the field anyway. I wash it, I promise, I'm not some barbarian.
---
THE LOOT
---
Can confirm, I once prefired a guy with a sniper *even though he slid* because I saw his mark move down. It‚Äôs kinda stupid. Also, I don‚Äôt think Foetracer‚Äôs mark lasts nearly as long

Do you have a Broken Awoken Talisman item in inventory?

ive clock between 4 and 5 hundred hours since warmind cause i fell for a female who play's the game so if it wasn't for her i may be at like 400 right now talking to her makes my day and the only time i get to talk to her is in party chat while playing
---
Jesus. That's a lot of Iron Banner. 
---
lmaaaoo
---
Thy boyfriend is thee has great taste. I see the 'Master Sword' as well! Very nice!
---
why would they need one eye mask when they can already see where you are 
---
The thing is i cant tell her cause she likes another guy that is usually in the party and they tell each other everything and i would die if she told him about this stuff

God I miss everything from D1. Oh how I wish D2 was just a massive expansion that took place of the D1 story.

They could have left a legacy map too so you could go back to the old content without messing up the timeline lore wise. Plus it would have given new players the chance to experience Destiny at its fullest.

my god haha

This isnt even impressive

Okay so I looked into it and it appears to be a perk of the inmost light. Try taking that off, and if the buff disappears that‚Äôll answer your question

What did u get the ship/sparrow/ghost doing?

That's good to know. But, I don't want to get rid of it. I wanted it to work for other my other characters.

I can't help but think it has something to do with the delayed queue cancellation after you finish a forge. Like you press ESC to cancel the queue, 5 seconds later it finally stops. Meanwhile you took a spot in a forge and it's starting up with only 2 people
---
As a warlock main i dont care. Ill just nova warp yo ass.
---
I play on average 5 hour a week and the only thing I focus on is powerful bounties. That's the nr 1 priority until I hit the light cap. Got to 650 last week so took 6 weeks, got to 607, then 619, 632, 640, 644 and finally 650. So I'd recommend, before you do anything else, do the powerful things. Start with dreaming city, then nightfall and then rest. 
---
But I didn‚Äôt have any powerful frames
---
I know how to do every part except calus. Whenever we get to the end we fail once and 4 people leave.
---
There is people with light 270 who finished all bounties when the cap was 600. Don't play it if you don't enjoy it, play it if you think it's fun. I got the full set the last IB before BA, before I reached the cap. It was very fun, I love IB, Control and the hunt. 
---
Why even tempt fate with 15 motes?
---
Flippin blueberries
---
SOOO satisfying to wield. The sounds, the model, the fact that it can be a heavy tier weapon if you use that honing perk AND it takes special ammo. What‚Äôs not to love?
---
Someones behind on memes
---
Curated with monochromatic shader 
---
Aggressive burst is it archetype.. That's not random.
---
I find it's reliably the best way to boost your light. Yes, you will be used as target practice. Yes, it is stacked against you. But you will progressively get the bounties, the general loot drops. As long as your pride doesn't mind taking a few knocks, it's very highly recommend.
---
It is the best lookoing sword in D2 right now!
---
By finding the 5 blighted essences in the 5 chests + completing Heroic Whisper you get 33% aprox, each week. 
---
I got 12% first time so... I will need 4 weeks...
---
I also hate pvp but only really when queuing solo it would suck if it was taken out of the game.
---
I mean... You can pay with dollars on that site too, dunno if they ship to the US too. You realize you can pay with your credit card on any site online, right?
---
First try and this f'in good? You sir are a talent by nature &lt;3
---
Which class do you main
---
Sitting at 48, 2 weeks left
---
Ah yet another fellow warlock main. Hello my good sir *tips hat
---
Calus is like the easiest part. Just requires communication.
---
What time zone are you in?
---
Yeah. Noticed.
---
Happened a lot to me around launch. Doesn‚Äôt happen often now anymore. The joining and matchmaking is weird for forges, I joined a guy who had been doing the forge solo for 10 minutes before I joined. We spent another 20 minutes almost losing and we somehow managed to kill the boss at the end of the volendo forge, No one else joined for that 20 minutes after I joined,
---
The range is generally better and the recoil doesnt get worst the longer you use breakneck is how i perceive that. As to why crimson is on there is beyond me tho since id expected huckleberry there lol
---
Which Barrel did you select? I have Extended and Full Bore.
---
The thirst lol
---
There are six chests. It's 2% per chest plus 24% for the mission completion. 36% per week, for three weeks total.
---
Was cringing at the last few when he's back started arching forward
---
Getting to 600 light and upgrading all the exotics I want to use to 600 only a week later to be td that the new cap is going to be 650 and I am left with no upgrade mats
---
Nice. Looking forward to getting mine too.
---
Missed opportunity with Shaxx amd "This is AMAZING!"
---
"Heavy ammo available"
---
Read the post, I got the blueprint and the mission completion, and I got 12%.
---
GMT but I'm nocturnal I'm on at night from 8pm till around 12pm the next day 
---
For this clip i used the instant replay of nvidia, overwolf's replay hud is also really good
---
Oof. I wanted to find an extended version of the epicness
---
I was thinking the same thing.  Maybe worth using over Whisper???
---
What was the reason you got tired with hunter?
---
Chaos Reach with the Geomag exotic boots is crazy DPS
---
I mean you are in no rush to get the shader are you? just wait until you get another weapon with the shader or scrap it and use the 7 cores to masterwork your other roll
---
I will definitely check it out, thank you!
---
Play all 3. They're not much different, there's no build or archetype like traditional mmos. It's just differing armor and supers. That's it.
---
That's where the huckleberry catalyst drops 
---
Sounds good, what‚Äôs the name of the clan?
---
I have to say that I spend more time than I‚Äôm willin‚Äô to admit playing this game, I‚Äôm pretty active and all. I play Titan and Hunter very well, and my Warlock is also topped off (only thing missing is Luna-faction boots). 
---
I used to be in a good clan before, folks were doing Raids and all. Then they suddenly stopped bein‚Äô active, so I decided to move on. Been jumping from clan to clan ever since in hopes of findin‚Äô a good clan with members actually playing the game, but I ended up in reddit soo..
---
"Perfectly balanced...as all things should be."      ---Mad Titan 
---
It happens sometimes for me as well think its just a feature to make it look cool or sumat lol
---
Great job on the carry even though you lost. I blame the pleb. 
---
Sol Pariah is arc
---
are you certian you didn't have a void damage mod on it when they got rid of them thus forcing it to be void for all of time?
---
The best way to raid is to play with the same group everytime. In my clan there's 4 groups that raids every week and we rarely mix with each other unless if we don't have enough people to fill in. That way most have their own set roles and you know each other playstyle. So try to get into a group that you can raid with frequently. I'm socially awkward and took me a few times before I really get comfortable with my group
---
Dude, we have plenty of mini DLC‚Äôs one more major one, and plenty of events.

---
You get obsidian accelerators from Bergusia ignitions, then turn those into Ada from Obsidian Radiance
---
bergusia forge
---
Control the zones
---
It is a little bit of a stretch, but not impossible I guess 
---
They are all fun to play on. Make sure you save your highest light weapon from each level as you play through on your 1st character.  It will help while leveling up the other two.
---
When doing the campaing make sure you complete the orange &amp; blue missions as you go.  They give great XP for leveling, most give blue gear for completion, and some give upgrade points for class abilities to help you unlock abilities faster. (Some recommend saving this till after, but if you do the rewards seem kinda mehh then, you no longer need the upgrade points, and you may be missing out on Daily Heroic Adventures for a Flashpoint planet.)
---
When you unlock Tess, buy several fireteam medailions from her.  Use them when you play, even if are playing alone.  If you don't have the dust to buy them, look for an XP ghost.  Getting to Level 50 should be your highest priority.
---
When you come across a public event, join in.  (Google how to make these heroic, please.) Heroic public events are great XP and a good chance for legendary and exotic gear.
---
Find a clan to play with.  Having friends in the game that can help you through a tough mission, strikes, etc. is priceless.  You also have the chance to get legendary and power engrams from Hawthorne for clan rewards.
---
3kids and a partner just might be the reason for the 1690h of play üòÇ :))
---
Sarcastic me when I get my fifth Sunbracers.
---
a way to farm them is to lower your light to something like 300 or 400 and just AFK. You‚Äôll be matched with people around the same light so you won‚Äôt be fucking anyone over
---
A guy shot it at the ground, it turned and flew along the ground to hit me. What is this gun
---
You might die a lot but yeah, IB is a good way. Public events with a ghost that has a 10% xp boost perk from all sources and a fireteam medallion is how my clan did it. Wait on doing any of the powerful bounties until your at 50 and 500 LL or about. After 500, the grind becomes real and only powerful engrams or prime engrams will increase your light level
---
Must post comments till at 7

Good luck dude :)

Because he‚Äôs massive! Dudes a beast. 
---
Yep vault and riven
---
I got some grin crucible
---
Technically Morgeth as well
---
What is considered a god roll on this sword ? Also how would you say it is compared to quickfang ? Just wondering if I should farm it or not.  
---
I am doing the 3 riven runs each week now currently I am stuck with 1 key because the fire team leader left early so I will have to jump back in 
---
Was it a Titan, named TaterThot? And what was your name?
---
Some reason that still makes no sense to me. When they were developing D2 they didn‚Äôt want to add too much dlc content from the first game into the second game. 
---
Crimson = infinite ammo and health regen, more for high-level activity add-clear, like in a Nightfall or raid
---
So no, but also yes. 
---
I'm basically done grinding for weapons in the forge. I have grinded out the following: 
---
Blast Furnace: Rasmussen ISA, Flared Magwell, Feeding Frenzy, Kill Clip + Backup Mag.
---
Kindled Orchid: Flared Magwell, Kill Clip, Rampage + Rampage Spec
---
Tatara's Gaze: Flared Magwell Snapshot, Kill Clip 
---
Hammerhead: Extended Mag, Feeding Frenzy, Rampage + Rampage Spec
---
Stryker's Surehand: Tireless Blade, Surrounded + Surrounded Spec
---
All of them are masterworked with an Obsidian Radiance on them. I've also already gotten Le Monarque, Jotunn, and Izanagi's Burden. So for me, the radiances are kinda just for fashion at this point. 
---
Fallen Footwear! I loved their shoes.
---
Huckleberry shreds. Throw devour on too and you can rip through boards of enemies with no regard for your safety
---
Thats a shame. I think I would enjoy this gamemode more than anything else. Maybe they will put in some day :)
---
When you try and fix your typo with another typo..  LOL
---
I dont know if its a but or something but in forge I have pulse rifle and handcannon frames only;;
---
If it wasn‚Äôt for the fact that it felt like cores were raining from the sky during the dawning I wouldn‚Äôt have been able masterwork my pulse
---
multiple characters is the bane of my existance, I can't play anything other than my lock for more than 15 minutes before getting bored to death :(
---
can't ever bother to get the weekly raid loot on my side characters
---
I literally only botherd around two weeks ago to get this aswell tbh. 
---
You got lucky. 
---
The original theory was that there was always a 1000 voices in two chests in the final room. So when you got to the final room, if you opened all of the chests, two would drop every time. 
---
This would mean holding onto keys would provide better chances. 
---
However, this has been disproved by groups saving enough keys to open all of the chests and not getting any and other groups getting more than the two. 
---
You just have X% chance at getting the drop every time you open a chest. Doing 3 Riven clears and then just doing Queenswalk once is a decent time save for groups though. 
---
I finally got to infuse shit I had been sitting on for a few weeks using other gear...I think that was a bad choice.  Right now I have 21, so I might actually be on the cusp of being able to get something MWed
---
ook ook me shotgun ape. me record screen with phone
---
Same, but replace the cat with my girlfriend
---
Not really I got my orb bounty on game 16 and that was the last one
---
I still haven't done any raid in this game. They look like actual work instead of a game complete with a "If you f--k it up, the whole team goes down with you!" threat.
---
I will
---
I imagine with the way they did the UI for it that there will be additional radiances, otherwise it would have made more sense to make there a quest to replace the weapon with an upgraded version.
---
Now you can do whisper quest solo!
---
I‚Äôm a huge fan of the blast furnace, as I have a feeding frenzy rampage roll and man it is so nice
---
My stockpile is up to 57 now but I‚Äôm close to max level for my third character now so I‚Äôm going to go down to zero once I start infusing the armor with the perks I want up to max for my hunter and titan like I did for my warlock 
---
Well I may run blade barrage, but I never solo someone. And telesto is too easy. There's no challenge in it, especially in quickplay
---
&gt; Are they going to fix it?
---
Nope.  I mean, if they haven't fixed it by now...
---
awesome .... how long do the raids take with a competent group?    I haven't raided since D1  as the Leviathan looked way to time consuming for gear earned.  Mind you this was well over a year ago 
---
It's on Ada's second page with the mods and mod components.
---
This is a great idea! I think this would really add some diversity to the crucible in general.
---
I mean, the base game was free for two weeks. Still had to buy forsaken and season pass. In this case its like maybe half true.
---
this week you can get only SMG from the boss, shotgun was last week random loot
---
You forgot "Getting the Huckleberry Catalyst and realizing that it makes it so much better than Breakneck"
---
For real though, IMO Huckleberry is greater than Breakneck, but you can't have it AND thunderlord :(
---
I have a wide screen. I keep the HUD relatively squished so I don't have to look to far to the right for the radar. 
---
Hahaha I'm just salty with the whole expansion stuff from the previous one haha. But yeah definitley see if you like it. It is a good game in my eyes all the problems lie behind the scenes money making haha. But even they aren't too bad. 
---
Definitley hit cap before committing to the DLC. Maybe after hitting cap watch a few gameplay vids on YouTube or something. I just love looting and finding gear and weapons its good for that. Always something to do. 
---
Good luck guardian !! 
---
Correct, Young Sheldon. It's one of many shows I keep on in the background for noise. Tend to prefer of over music.
---
The numer of times this works is surprisingly high during the first few days of the week when there's more people playing crucible is astonishing. Do this on Sunday and your hosed. 
---
Tartarus v2 actually. 
---
New background, cheers buddy :)
---
Yup
---
Yeah I need to get a better roll on my hammerhead but getting those powerful enemy kills is boring. For real though I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever play gambit again without jotunn, three shorting envoys and ogres has never felt so good. 
---
Right, I didn‚Äôt know we had access to a quest for it yet 
---
Shotting*
---
Thanks guardian! Now I know that‚Äôs what we‚Äôve been doing 
---
Because i stopped playing D2 after Warmind. Though with the activusion split i may pick it back up eventually
---
Agreed. I wish they would make more fast travel points for dreaming city as well 
---
There are almost certainly going to be more Radiance mods added in the future. If some of them have positive *and* negative effects, you may decide you want to take it off.
---
Where does it come from
---
Didn't you find it peculiar that he said to drop your LL sub 400? You do this so that you don't get matchmade with others trying to clear it normally. He's not ruining anyone's experience. 
---
Uh, Yes.
---
The lower light level matches you with other people at that same or similar levels. If I have a sub 400 LL and match with others like that there is obviously no way to complete a forge. I personally made sure to test this for a ew hours before setting it up over night and not once did I match with someone over 400LL in that time. 
---
I also hate AFK people in certain situation but I did everything I could to ensure that I wasn‚Äôt affecting anyone‚Äôs else‚Äôs game play. 
---
I agree . And i also never liked putting on a big heavy knights armor on my stealthy Hunter. Looks like a Titan. The helmets are sometimes pretty cool though. 
---
You probably should no joke exact same thing with me but a friend of mine got me back into it, its that nostalgia feeling of destiny that gives me a reason to grind a game that is worth it 
---
Some times worth it
---
And it can one hit an invader with full overshield with a direct hit. But also once I get 3 more kills on invaders with their super active and two more resets this season I‚Äôm going to be done with gambit unless they seriously change the rewards for the time commitment that a single game is
---
If you have any proficiency with mobility you can dodge it‚Äôs shot lol trust me I‚Äôve seen people do it and I‚Äôve done it. Just use your mobility 
---
I was one shooting double kills with my militias last night... it was glorious 
---
Poor Little White Hunter 2
---
"What we need is mo' Glimmuh."
---
Izanagi forge. You can farm it this week if you want to
---
It does not because the first round of the forge ends before it can time you out. 
---
Are there statistical differences aside from the regular stats for the classes?  My warlock regens waaaaay faster than my Titan and only has one or two regen more allocated.
---
I ain't gonna lie and please don't down vote me to hell for this... The original white makes the gun look like a toy gun.
---
If I were to list them from best to worst, it would be Blast Furnace, Bygones, and Chattering Bone
---
Blast Furnace is easily the best pulse rifle in the game
---
I approve of your initial response.
---
Staring Ar‚Äôthuar
---
For me it‚Äôs the ships 
---
Or try it out and find out if it actually works. Mine worked fine.
---
My lady got it from doing a non-powerful frame! (I'm salty because she also got a duplicate Jotunn at the same time RiP)
---
Mechanically Destiny 2 is pretty fantastic, they need dedicated hosted servers for PVP, a Matchmaking algorithm guy, and a dedicated PVP tuning team with good community reps. Blizzard does all of this extremely well, OW, HotS, SC2, WoW all have incredible community managers and MMR based competitive games. 
---
One eyed mask would have been nerfed long ago in WoW, and look at Mercy's ultimate, it was meta breaking so they redid it entirely. 
---
I don't think they need a clean slate, they have a Gorgeous game, they have a fairly successful roadmap, if they have a story to tell they can do it in expansions for years to come.
---
Yeah I got my lunas howl recently so that was a lot of my precision kills
---
It ain't so secret, partner. Seems like half the community wants it, and I'm ok with that. Fallen have some neat lore, and I like most of their stuff in general. Queenbreaker and Lord of Wolves are some of my favorite weapons, and I want Dreg's Promise back too.
---
I did not ruin anyone else‚Äôs game. 
---
Forge matchmaking is based on light level. I intentionally dropped my light level to sub 400 in order to match with others at that level who were doing he same thing I was for lore. I tested this for a few hours before setting my system up over night to make sure that I wasn‚Äôt going to ruin anyone else‚Äôs experience. 
---
Almost everybody I was queued up with was right around 650 except for a few exceptions.
---
If only you could dual-wield them! :D
---
Ok,thanks
---
worldline zero is much more tedious than sleeper :) congrats on the sword though!
---
Oh ok
---
Where did I say anything about shoulder charge? 
---
Nope. In Ghost Stories: Confessions of Hope part 1 and 2, Jaren Ward tells the tale of how Shin was killed by dregs when he was a baby and the traveler revived him on the spot, merging Shin's own spark of light with Jaren's inner light, thus creating the one and only Shin Malbaby. His ghost was killed immediately too, so he was a ghostless guardian who could age, but became immortal again when Ward's ghost found him and veryfied his compatibility with Shin's light. It's a terrible way to write it, but it's canon. It's kind of how Bungie tried to explain why Shin retains the memories of his entire life.
---
P.S.: In The Last Word grimmoire cards, Shin tells his story based on his own memory and the residual memory left by Jaren in his ghost because of a neurosymbiosis between guardian and ghost, or something like that.
---
Amazing is what it is.
---
In all seriousness though I use it constantly in pvp because it's broken as fuck but they will probably nerf the tracking soon 
---
Nah, why try to improve your skill level when faced with a challenge when you can just ask the devs to nerf or remove everything.
---
I‚Äôm talking about the mini fist of havoc bull shit 
---
Nah, sometimes things just escape our memories.
---
Mate I don't want it nerfed either. But it probably will be because a smuch as I love it if I didn't have it I would definitely want it nerfed because the tracking is broken good
---
\*Rasmussen wants to know your location\*
---
NEW LORE NEW LORE
---
How the hell would that even work??  lol
---
This 
---
I got bored of d1 pretty quick and now with d2 having so much end game content it's actually fun grinding. But everyone is entitled to there own opinion. 
---
Thats cool.  I was under the impression it was in one season and grinded it out to get the three all in one.  Nice to know.
---
Is this just a PlayStation thing or is there a website I can go to in order to see mine?
---
Hate is easy to come by. What I didn't expect to find was you: the rogue gentleman. It takes a hunter to prove there's honor among thieves.
---
For those struggling. Just do it daily on reset. You‚Äôll get one in 3-4 nodes. And just work on the rest of the title. 
---
...I got all the weapons in a week. Not joking. 
---
With a good roll. But in the same sence each wep is good for something but I do prefer chattering bone over blast for PvP but blast for Pve all day becuz my roll is good for pve 
---
nope beat that a couple of times and got almost nothing from it. just armor pieces with crap rolls for things I never use. 
---

How do you post pictures to Reddit? I'm trying to with the app, but it says "this subreddit only allows text posts." Thanks. 
---
Saw-shank Redemption
---
What is your light level?
---
That is really not as good as you think... the amount of height required to land a 1 shot thundercrash makes the Titan super vulnerable and requires you to pretty much stand still while he does it....
---
Need 
---
Seas of methane
---
As far as I know the only thing that transfers from D1 is your character builds (IE how your character's look).
---
google "Time Wasted on Destiny"
---
yep
---
Yeah thats my k/d. Kinda crappy crucible one cause i never play lol.
---
But it was time limited? And i think some profile stuff? 
---
&gt; I didn't call YOU small, I'm saying if you got killed TWICE by someguy, then you get a lucky shot off on him because hes literally solo, you really have no room to brag.
---
The whole point of a teabag is to enrage someone, so tbh the less it's deserved, the better. 
---
As someone who has very little time to play anymore, I understand you line of reasoning, but no. This broke HoW crucible in D1. Fellwinter and shot-package shottys galore. Everyone wanted the peak meta weapons, killing all diversity
---
Just my two cents
---
Teabagging is just poor taste imo 
---
How do you post picture posts on here? Only lets me do text. Thanks. 
---
I may hate the shotgun runners but, damn those were some nice takedowns. Shame you were on the unlucky end of the stick. Would have loved to see the hate mail if you‚Äôd wiped them. 
---
I have the Ship, Sparrow and Ghost shell for the Last Wish Raid.  I also have the Dreaming City Sparrow.  I forget where I got it, but i'm realizing i'll never get the ship or the ghost shell.
---
I‚Äôm a .90 Kd lol. Never complain when I get fucked my win rate is still 80% tho 
---
I got this same roll on my blast furnace last time it was available but with one large problem. Both sights were long zoom scopes and so it zooms in way too much for my liking. 
---
Is that 100% confirmed?
---
but wait, what about your guns... cause while I have every hunter exotic I'm missing some OP guns. 
---
That gun needs a serious nerf. 
---
I wouldn‚Äôt know. I only have the base game.
---
Also, was the traveler ever on Titan? I‚Äôm confused by your argument. 
---
I ran them and got a red war exotic. I hate my life
---
I do too, until it deflects off the other side of a map and kills ONLY me. 
---
Hell yes!
---
OUTBREAK PRIME &gt;3
---
Depends on the pace.. kill clip is like 1.5x stacks of rampage I think so of you're only killing one thing every 4 seconds then kill clip is better, if you kill more then rampage is better... I just like consistency so prefer feeding frenzy + kill clip
---
‚Äú good ‚Äú
---
Random drop or is she selling it?
---
The traveller magicked all the planets, probably by visiting all of them 
---
imo Bygones is better as 1 burst from either of those should 1 shot enemies (especially with rampage stacks), meaning Bygones can deal with more enemies much faster than Blast Furnace/Go Figure. I also like much faster reload speed which makes you able to keep chaining rampage easily without the need of Rampage Spec (which sucks, it only adds duration, no damage increase) so you can use a Minor Spec instead.  
---
Also I'm honestly not sure, but I feel like Aggresive Frames have super low bodyshot damage? Even though they are supposed to have more damage per burst I sometimes find myself not 1 shoting a trash mob, this of course doesnt happen with Bygones.
---
Congrats, I never wanted to go to Mars again after that quest
---
Never actually got it so i wouldnt even know
---
PS: If you use the shank cheese you need to kill him before putting the level 7 code in to complete it. My team was stuck because of that. 
---
She is selling it this week
---
On precision kills it would drop seeking clusters that did damage to nearby mobs. Kind of like a firefly. 
---
The problem was the tie breaker. Couldn‚Äôt take the point from a whole team hiding behind Titan shields with heavy lol. 
---
Sleeper is one of those Destiny weapons that has an insane "cool factor" - it's just so unique compared to other heavy exotics. It's also something I could see an AI dreaming up so humans could be armed in a fight against an impossible alien enemy.
---
I‚Äôve seen thundercrash get triples lol.  Titans are in an OP spot right now, a lot of people I know are switching to them because it‚Äôs such a blatant advantage.
---
Best news I've gotten today. 
---
I had one with this exact roll in my vault for months without even knowing. I'm not so much a shotgun guy, but I tried it yesterday and it's a beast.
---
I recommend you keep grinding!
---
Wait what. Your kidding me right...
---
We did 7 wave 7 runs and it just didn't work because of that. 
---
Look up u/rsntylenol it is his last post. Sorry I was having trouble linking the picture. I'm on mobile.

r/yesyesyesno
---
About an hour, the firebase one right? He almost always dropped the drb, out of like the 30+ legendary emgram he drops only 5 of them was the Duke and some random armor, rest were all drb.
---
And idk if this is the God roll, I heard slideshot, Quickdraw, etc. I think it's just different bias from different playstyles. As long as you get full choke, accurized, range mw, maybe snapshot, that would be the roll imo from my bias. 
---
Good representation of Transformers Robots in Disguise...

I hate you. The Hunter is a bit to fast. Im triggered.

Your reddit name is as well üòÇ

I got one character to 650 and then put my weapons on my other characters then used crucible tokens to boost the light on my armor. Then it took like two weeks to after that. 
---
The dawning armor with raiden flux and Caydes cloak. With monochromatic shader on every piece of armor. 
---
Aw I thought you were gunna go for that last jump into the actual forge. Wonder if I can bring a pike there ü§î

On a related note, what am I supposed to do with 1200 etheric spirals?
---
Sloane would be happy, that old mama bear surely does feel lonely in that rig.

Lousy damn good question. I wish I knew myself.
---
I‚Äôve always been told it was a nice upgrade, but I never realized how big of a difference it makes! Thank you for sharing this! 
---
god man he's good sure but he's such an ass like over half the time i try watching him...it doesn't help imo his voice sounds AWFUL and just plain cocky the entire time, i wish i could find a PVP'er that wasn't such a dick, like i'm fine with those that get angry as atleast it shows emotion but people like CammyCakes are just guh so awful, Idk maybe that's just me
---
Damn yeah most the time it‚Äôs DRB but he only drops 1 for every 5-10 runs through it.

That‚Äôs a good thing

Thanks now i know to just focus on the ascendant challenge. The ghost is all i need for my seal.

I have the ghost/ sparrow but haven‚Äôt gotten the ship (only thing I need for cursebreaker)
---
Same. 2200+ stems since the release of titles/collections and cant get a frigid jackal for the life of me. Got 2 winterwolfs this week from schematics and finally got 2 more non-duplicate override frequencies so at 35/40. RNG is aids for me on Mars. Finally got the Ikelos sniper last week after a bajillion EP clears
---
~~You‚Äôre never gonna get it~~  Best of luck!

Feels that way

Because male characters always look like shit and have worse voice actors

Something called wastedondestiny.com it‚Äôs not an app

But.. You lost
---
*groans* Here have an upvote and get back into the fray!
---
Next time its on rotation kcco622 on PSN. I'll grind it a million times if needed til we both get it
---
yes, ship can drop from all 3 encounters within shattered throne.
---
What exactly does ‚Äòtime wasted‚Äô mean?
---
I would say the way this community is most of the time, you will never be cool.  :)
---
~~Face it, you‚Äôll be dead before you get the ship to drop~~ good luck!
---
Think it means time spent in the tower doing nothing not sure though 
---
Season 1. Never available again, from what I've read. :( I wanted it too. Looks so much better than the other two.
---
Male titans really doesn't look good 
---
Pulse rifles and hand cannons are optimal. Scout rifles can be viable as well.
---
I‚Äôm missing the ghost, ship, and sparrow. Locking titles behind RNG is the biggest load of hogwash I‚Äôve ever seen. I‚Äôve been doing these on all characters every week, and I haven‚Äôt gotten anything yet. It‚Äôs infuriating that I‚Äôm locked out of Cursebreaker because my RNG sucks. 
---
Bygones
---
Seeing as it competes with machineguns, it really isnt all that. Oneshotting supers is nice though!
---
a shot in the dark would be because people can play as whoever they want for literally any reason they want lol

First time I was teabagged I thought dudes controller went hinky...had no clue WTF the guy was doing!

---
u/cloakboi is absolutely correct - there is so much non-raid content to grind out each week that even smashing all your weekly stuff is a challenge if you aren't devoting a lot of time to it per week. 
---
Edit: the above applies if you aren't just trying to get it all done as fast as possible, and instead are trying to maximize your power gains each week. 
---
I'm not sure, probably someone else as you can have the same username. I was with Burntcrepe and JediTurtle. But maybe.
---
one thing I have to warn u. without catalyst, the charge up time is longer than the quest itself. don't bother to aim for the head because u can't even aim with this.
---
tldr: bring it to invade and train
---
For me, when I was in middle school (long time ago... lol) I wrote a series of stories while I had some free time and there were two female characters in those stories that have stuck with me all these years.  They end up in just about any video game I play as some form or other.  So naturally, one of them is my female Hunter and the other is a female Awoken.  One was a ranger with a bow, one was a magic user.  They fit in very well.  They been in everything from Ultima Online, to WWE games, to Destiny.  :)

Same goes for individual triumphs. The Spider's weekly Wanted enemy bounties are this way. There's triumphs for every one, except that the pool is weighted. I have seen Silent Fang probably 6+ times, Arcadian Chord 7, and Gravetide Summoner maybe 8. Yet Blood Cleaver and Combustor Valus have only come up twice each since the release of Forsaken.
