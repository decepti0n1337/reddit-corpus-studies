Holy shot gladd

---
Not a banana pfft
---
I thought maybe it should take from reserves but the last 3 shots regenerate ammo so like you only have those 3 shots left and no room to miss a shot. That way if you're good enough you can continue unloading but just 1 missed crit would stop the regen
---
and taken makes target immune right as I fire
---
I blame mostly EA
---
Man I need to get me some a dem saurons gauntlets
---
Well if you feel like helping support Randy *Fucking* Pitchford then go ahead. That shit head isn't going to get a cent of my money.
---
Well, i typically touch on everything i want to get across online simply because things can easily be missed, but just for you, i will make this post as quick and clean as i can. 
---

---
1. The reference bit in my post before this one was in regards to you calling the marshmello skin a reference, which it isn't, making it a poor example. I didn't fail to say what it was, it is a brand deal between the two companies to have a licensed skin in game, that is what it falls under. 
---
2. I also said "Or pays homage too," which was included for a reason, That is what the reaper skin would fall under. (And i mean is it really all that hard to make a look a like of a guy with longer black hair and a bear, in a black suit? kind of a weak argument don't you think?) And i use the word typically because while they are the most used definitions, i am leaving room for others, because i do not have a 100% answer on it so theres that.
---
3. I asked you several times to show me what skins you are referring to when you say "Obvious look a likes" So i will ask you again **What skins are you referring too when you say obvious look alikes and what do they resemble?** I also had the list of skins to show skins that are references, this was more in line with my point of what a reference is, not anything else. 
---
4. Crackshot and Nutcracker Zenyatta are both skins pulling from an outside source, a holiday nutcracker. Both skins were released as Christmas exclusive skins because nutcrackers are a common theme in the holidays. Here is a link showing the two skins with a nutcracker https://imgur.com/a/oLnLjNO Notice how they both pull resemble the nutcracker??? That is not an opinion, that is a fact for you, my opinion is that if you asked me which did crackshot resemble more, The actual nutcracker or Zen, i would point to the Nutcracker. 
---
5. I did the word analyze to show you how you were coming off, the end bit was me coming off as a jerk and i can fully admit that, but that is how i felt you were coming off through your choice of words and phrases, as well as context. The way you were discussing things with other people were coming off in those ways, at least they were to me, but that is my opinion.  
---
6.  Never once did i say that they do not copy, hell i even pointed out a better example then you have this entire conversation with Blackbeard and Sledgehammer, My point was that in your original post you say  "I've seen fortnite copy a lot of skins from different games" and "And thousands of skins ripped from overwatch." When in all reality, they are not the only gaming company to do this, and they do not even do it as much as you are claiming.  Also, i didn't accidentally admit anything, i purposely admitted it because when you are just debating with someone, you admit the right and wrong of both sides, if you are trying to win an argument, then you are biased in your information and try to hide things, and had i not said that, or brought up black beard, i would have been hiding plain to see look a likes, but that is also where i asked to see what you are referring to when you say other look a likes, because to me other then black beard and john wick, there arent many. 
---
Ultimately, i wasn't offended by your comment, i was debating it, and online it can be hard to tell the difference but all of this was just a debate to me at the end of the day. Ultimately this one was still kind of long, but both of us have been writing essays at this point, so its not easy to narrow it all down to just a sentence or two for each point.
---
Lost 20% damage-getting deeper pockets(more damage) from the catalyst
---
Sooo tired of these whiny posts.
---
Ace is more balance than Nerf. LoW is getting deeper pockets from catalyst so damage isn't really gone.
---
Garden of Esila
---
Yeah it is kind of like the shotgun nerf people were going to delete their ikelos and threat levels. Come to see after the nerf they still are some of the most used weapons still
---
Wait.. There are other guns besides hand cannons??
---
People have been whining all week that they won't get free heavy ammo and free supers anymore what makes you think they won't complain about not getting free exotics for knocking out something that's basically been another Queen's Court?
---
The thing that worries me is if we had to nerf those to bring it in line with where skull and Orpheus ended up then it sounds like all of those exotics are going to be barely noticeable.
---
Do you mind sharing the stl with me? I’m not printing it for commercial purposes I’m just horrible at 3D modeling, and broke
---
Have you used the 21%?
---
That's my default heavy
---
Find two people who want to cheese it and be their third, doing the cheese flying in glitch. You'll never have to shoot at anything and you'll all get the gun. 
---
I dont condone the cheese method but it's common knowledge and your be a hard carry at that light.
---
Rip Cayde
---
Not too much, to be honest. It’s just much easier to get DARCI than Whisper.
---
That's actually the most infuriating thing.
---
I really hate when I save my nova to melt a boss or a servitor with a lot of health, and they just teleport away.
---
Or when you invade in gambit and someone walks behind a wall and the wall just deletes your nova.
---
Oh, 21% def outperforms it, but I just love the feel of the Avalanche.
---
That's a great line! Where have I heard it before?
---
Luna may not be used but NF certainly will be. And changes can be made towards Luna for it to be used. Range, aim assist, stuff like that. Lower the gap between NF and Luna so both can be used. 
---
Unlike Luna and NF, an outlaw rampage Duke is skilled. You have a slow killing weapon that only kills fast once it gets that first kill. Even then you have a slow window to use that fast ttk. 
---
I absolutely love your point about 99% of PC Luna's kills being headshots. Not only is that complete horse shit with no way to prove it, but you just said "god forbid we have a weapon that rewards precision." Now all of a sudden it's actually harder to miss a headshot than it is to get 3 in a row? Holy fucking shit lmao
---
And killing quicker than a 150 is garbage design. Its entire design is "I kill faster than any other handcannon. I do it easily and require no skill. But hey, my range stat is shorter." Garbage design. This nerf is needed. Some compensation buffs are needed so that stats are like that of Waking Vigil for Luna, and much superior to Waking Vigil for NF.
---
ngl that sounds p neat
---
I mean I've only ever done it on Voidlock since Blink is a class specific Jump
---
It’s kinda 50-50. I like wearing Reaper gear so I can drop special ammo for my team because I feel more comfortable thinking they’ll at least have a shotgun/fusion/sniper to use for whatever it is they might need. 
---
BUT if no one is invading or protecting the bank, I’ll do both those jobs too since they’re literally close to each other and just reap from a distance. I’ll only run in to clear/collect if an invasion just happened or if I know we’ll be safe.
---
Yeah or trespasser, it’d be nice if they came out with another exotic sidearm
---

It's a pretty funky adventure. It's one of my favorite weapons for Gambit because it burns single targets very well but I'm just still not sure whether it's worth the exotic sacrifice.

I JUST FELT YOUR PAIN FRIEND
---
The black armory is not part of forsaken. That being said you have purchased the annual pass. My opinion. I stopped playing D2 from February to April. Started again in April and decided about a week or two ago this isnt for me.
---
After being away for two months I was getting all the right drops for the right weapons and armor at the right time. Got to 700 and decided to try a second character. 90% of the time I was getting weapon drops. Doesn't help that I already have 700 power weapon drops on another character.
---
My point is that this game is a waste of time. It's satisfying for a bit then completely slaps you in the face. After this week's twab, I'm never gonna play D2 again. And no chance in hell I'll play D3.
---
Wow if only marginally better then why dont people use a legendary sniper + 1K voices?

He was clearly referring to future raid bosses. Use your brain.

Oof.
---
Shotgun that feels amazingly powerful? People whined that they didn’t have Ikelos Shotty due to RNG reasons, and that people were requiring it in their loadouts. But that’s because most of us want to be on teams that are efficient at slogging through the same activities every reset. So instead of fixing the RNG aspect of things, implementing a good percentage increase for every time you did EP and didn’t get the gun, or bringing other legendary weapons up to par in damage capabilities... they slow down the firing rate and change trench barrel to 3 shots and/or 4 seconds. I still use it but it’s less fun now. But it’s balanced to a degree.
---
They’re also okay with DRB one shotting you from 10m away in PvP.
---
I’m okay with things that balance out, but the nerf to Whisper literally took the exotic out of the exotic. The gun id dead as of SoO. And that’s not fun.
---
 
---
Orpheus Rigs required no further nerfing than it had already.
---
They are true Hunter weapons
---
looks great! good job!

you gotta keep that thing out if you wanna keep Momento Mori bud.

Why is that a golden icon in your Energy slot?

No I don't

I wouldn’t recommend playing without all the dlc, they don’t really add content to the game unless it’s dlc

Thank you I'll probably buy it next paycheck I do really like this game

U need to do it 3 times to get the shell

Gonna agree as a warlock only main in Destiny 2. But I do worry more about Bungie's approach to how they do nerfs. As most of the time instead of being a simple shave off of power. They instead snap it half leaving it busted and basically non-usable. Repeat this process over and over again. Main reason I stopped in Destiny 1 house of wolves. Only got drug back in with Forsaken and that cycle has not really stopped. Scout rifles still suck. 
---
That being sad why not buff up the other warlock exotics but make more usable ones. As most of the subclass non-specific exotics, sans Lunafactions and maybe Ophidians/ Karnsteins, really, really suck. Like The Stag, Eye of Another World or Sanguine Alchemy. Those three are really bad and are never used because of that. For warlocks their is maybe 2 or 3 useful exotics per element type. Void: Skull, Sin and maybe Contraverse Holds. Solar: Sunbracers, Lunafactions, and Phoenix Protocol. Arc: Crown of Tempests, Getaway Artist (pvp), and Geomags. 
---
I just worry as a bottom tree arclock main about my poor Crown getting nerfed later.
---
Apologize for any 2:00am spelling errors
---
So did you realize you were under leveled. That's why you only took off his shield, otherwise it would've been a kill in normal crucible
---
That's the ''fix'', putting Whisper on the energy slot. To compensate it's nerf, you'll find more ammo, and since Bungie says it had an unfair advantage compared to other sniper rifles, it would make sense
---
The nerfs.
---
Oh yeah. That's how it's done. Welcome to the club my dude. We speak only in laughing emojis 😂😂😂

It's a hard weapon to time imo but it pays off

Yes, I absolutely hate it but it’s the only crucible reward I get other than armour

It still a very good weapon. You can use it with a antiope-d or another smg

Le Monarque with Oathkeepers and a secondary shotgun is my favorite load out for PvP. Really underrated imo

Time to flip that calendar mate!

And my point is that the nerf talks have no place in this conversation, especially after pointing out how you can counter the stomp with a melee.
---
The number of orbs tether makes isn't changing, is it? You can charge your whole team's supers with one tether, and get your back from their orbs. I don't see why you'd *need* two.

The black screen for everyone sometimes happens when the person doing the glitch starts the glitch too soon. If you start spamming before the ships nose dive, some times nobody flies in. They just need to stop spamming briefly then continue, or just retry.

I've actually found that there are some really good teams and there are some really bad teams. I once went into a match against a 4 stack of people from the same clan and my team was all solos and we wrecked them so hard they quit out 1 after another. But otherwise yeah, I know exactly what you mean. I keep getting so close to the end of Heroic 3 (where i am now, I just wanna get to fabled so I can be done with all this bs) and then end up on 4/5/6 losing streaks and it's rough
---
If it does come back I hope the perk is different. No not rng gunfights plz
---
Having the 10+ armour boost gives a special intro like for collector (master race) "hey collector, drifters gotta fever, couple of motes will make it all better" And "hey a collector, don't let the invaders tell you otherwise, you're the real heroes"
---
&gt;If they made content more challenging, they wouldn’t have to make exotics into legendaries or rares.
---
Your first and third points are spot on, but I don't think this one is necessarily true. If certain items are too powerful, it widens the gap between those who do and those who don't have it, leading to newer players being booted from every raid team, or just unable to do certain things unless they are highly skilled. I don't agree with every upcoming nerf, but I do with some of them. Skull of Dire Ahamkara was an instant "I win" button in most pve activities, with almost no downsides, for example. Cannot speak for orpheus rigs, as I am a warlock main.

The Riven cheese was big enough to ruin the fight IMO. Pretty sure it was found around 10 days after the raid came out and as more and more people found out and became a high enough light level to do, it became the 'meta' when pugging raids. The requirements ended up being a much higher light level than was needed and a cluster rocket. This ended up letting a lot of players that couldn't do the intended mechs be able to clear the raid. I think a few months later Bungie tried to fix the cheese by nerfing cluster bomb but it didn't really do much. The cheese is still do able with a bunch of different weapons. I think cheese's like this should be fixed ASAP because it takes away from the content and just rewards bad players really. Since more content has come out and a new raid, I think they just gave up on fixing it now which is to be expected. Bungie don't really fix cheese's from what I can tell and I think because its PVE they get ignored anyway.
---
He probably killed you with the shotgun before you charged him but the lag made it do that.
---
How do you know he cheesed for it? He could just be mad about it
---
I'll definitely look you guys up, thanks much!
---
I've never done one before...mostly too scared of getting screamed at for not getting the mechs down fast enough. I've dealt with a lot of toxicity just trying to do the PvP centric quests, so being exposed to that, can only imagine how people would act for you not doing a raid well.
---
Raids actually require doing certain things at certain times and take more than natural shooting skill. Took me a good 5 deaths and watching a guide to get Prime down, so I can only imagine how long it'd take for a raid.
---
Kudos for doing something I'm still scared to do, but will eventually dip my toe in eventually and probably come to love it.
---
But he melee’d me?
---
Yeah, my clan was very nice and patient, also I’m a sqeaker, so I was ultra nervous they would be toxic
---
What was in the first reply? cause the notification had except at the end. Unless it wasn't important
---
Oh my bad. Replace shotgun with melee then. He might have shot and punched you at the same time.
---
The titan struggle is real for shoulder charge.
---
Don't shoot it at 180, shoot it at 150-160 rpm. Three even taps
---
I said something, but realized it was incorrect. I said that you would waste it because how would already be reloading after shooting 3, but I remembered how it still doesn’t reload now
---
Honestly the after the nerf it should be a secondary
---
Oh it's ok, just didn't want to miss anyone's opinions

xkoolaidman47x on destiny tracker. Stats alone pretty much scream cheese let alone the 30 free comp wins. You can also tell by op’s movement and aim that he didn’t get to legend legit.
---
Maybe
---
The whisper was special because it did great damage, and as long as you never missed you wouldn't have to reload. It's going to become a slightly above average sniper that takes heavy ammo.

Rat king was specifically designed to be a team based boss DPS exotic with some solo play ability, and is only useful at short ranges. That's its niche. It's also limited by ammo, holding only 184 rounds, or 18.4 seconds worth, of ammo without any reserve perks. In addition, the rate of fire increase is a flat bonus, which caps DPS, and only occurs when nearby other players, limiting the usability of it in situations such as insurrection prime, where grouping up=death, and Kalli, with her intensive knockback abilities. It also requires an auto reloading perk to be in play, or else you'd be subject to reloading every 2 seconds, for a 62.5% uptime (it takes about 1.2 seconds to reload.). In comparison, Outbreak prime would have a 76.2% uptime in the same conditions, as it takes 4.8 seconds to empty a magazine and 1.5 seconds to reload without outlaw. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Outbreak Prime, on the other hand, is designed as a solo ad clear weapon, but is still better in group play and boss DPS than Rat King because it doesn't have its restrictions. It's good in mid ranges and usable at longer ranges, and doesn't require all of its users to be clustered up for to be effective, meaning it can take full advantage of the phase radiance in Insurrection Prime, for example. It also holds 462 rounds without reserve perks, for over a full minutes worth of damage, and has no damage cap, meaning it can ramp up its DPS indefinitely during that time.
---
Outbreak doesn't even need the best boss DPS, either. It's loaded with two bonus damage perks (nanites on rapid hit, nanites weakening enemies), a crowd control perk (nanite firefly), and a reload perk (outlaw). And that's not even mentioning the catalyst, which will further boost its DPS and damage and give it the ability to chain kills like sunshot, but with a better range and more effectively. Outbreak also has the best overall DPS of any primary on majors, even in solo play. It would still be a top tier weapon without both the highest damage and DPS of any primary weapon in the game with a team because it already fills two other niches better than any other exotic.

I'm excited about new gear, not about the season. It's probably gonna suck again if it's really raid based. I don't have the proper people to do any of that with so..

---
Nice work, Sentry.
---
Infinite ammo shouldn’t have been a thing anyway; like from a balance perspective being able to almost completely ignore heavy ammo economy is an insane thing to design, especially when it takes almost no skill to land your shots. Like yeah you have to have a measure of accuracy, and on console the risk/reward is a little higher than the point-click of PC, but it still doesn’t warrant infinite ammo for the skill level the game demands. Maybe they could have done it differently by giving a small percentage chance to generate ammo on chained hits, but still it was a change that everyone should have seen coming at some point. 
---
And it being the only gun to give free heavy ammo like that... it’s no wonder they have problems designing certain boss encounters knowing that’s a choice for people, and thus why it’s the only choice in certain boss encounters. It sounds like this is a halfway step, to make things less “meta” and be able to viably use many different weapons.
---
I love how that scene cuts to Petra Venj saying "what the fuck"

What system are you playing on?

Also it can be soloed but damn do you need to be patient!

Congrats guardian! I still haven't completed any of them yet

You talk about scopes and perks (game mechanics) and I talk about visual differences in models (aesthetic).

Perhaps you should reexamine what you and I are talking about, then.
---
Either way, I'm done with this conversation as I feel we talk next to each other, and not with each other.

Destiny fits better with star wars. Look at Solo. So mcu shared symbolism. The helmet of the raider leader. Her weapon. The sword dryden vos uses that looks like "it stared back" and he has these heat knives that look like blade barage knives.
---
Male hunter? Wack
---
The sad thing is, D2 actually does, but it's only in the blue quality weapons. You can find the Vision of Confluence style scouts for example. I sure wish we could get legendary varients of the blues, some look INCREDIBLE
---
That's a pretty shitty sentiment. If your team is playing 'bad', maybe sweat a bit and see if you can't carry them across the line. 
---
Sometimes you get a bad team. See it through or quit, maybe. It's a bit of a baby move to throw your toys and just not try.

In this guy's case: If he was such a 'pro-strats gamer', he should have been able to open his backpack and carry the whole damn team, no matter how bad they were playing. If NOT, maybe quit the bitchin' and play the match the best he could like a proper guardian.

I've never heard of Nadir, Cassoid, Crux &amp; Lomar

That caused me so much pain to watch. That poor team.

How could one possibly take this seriously

not that i can't get a team, I can get one easy, it's just time I don't have

Some ppl don't understand the achievement , but there's a lot of ppl who have still never done a raid. I did 1 raid about a year ago, and I'm pretty sure it was just part of a raid. Like getting a checkpoint or something.

I have two toddlers so it's always hard for me to commit to a dedicated gaming session.
