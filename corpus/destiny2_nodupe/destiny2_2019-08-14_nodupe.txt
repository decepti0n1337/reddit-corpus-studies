You've probably missed the actual times to play said events. Not entirely sure Bungie would screw that up, as they're the ones that keep that data, but you're asking the wrong folks. You need to ask Bungie themselves.

---
Gratz! Just collected mine too :D
---
Glory level. 
---

---
Sometimes stacks are not always what they appear. 
---
The randoms however are being matched with equal or around similar glory.
---
What even is that
---
It’s the “eye” of your ghost!
---
Where does it say that in his essay? Am I just blind?
---
How does liars handshake compare to fully stacked winters guile?
---
The ahamkara are aware that they are in a game so beware.
---
&gt;Gambit 
---
To make regular gambit worth playing :P
---
Yeah this works especially if you can go off the map around a building
---
Ok it seams you are correct. Thank you.
---
I’ve been running Prometheus Lens lately and it’s basically recluse but it needs special ammo. People have been sleeping on Trace Rifles so you’re probably right about them getting a buff.
---
I have a Night Watch with a super fast reload. Like, almost faster than Outlaw reload
---
Thats fair but you could have gotten way higher easier. Match game isnt as tough as people make it out to be and gives a full 1% dunno why im getting downvoted for speaking the truth lol. Hard to hear all the way up at 5500 i guess.
---
ash factory right?
---
So how do you know that wasn't a repost from Twitter, like most of the posts on here are? You reeing (all noise, no point) doesn't really show that the other post was original, it just shows that you probably spend too much time on this app.
---
I feel ya, really annoying how I have to grind for 30-40 hours of reckoning to even have 10 spare Rations drop for me rn. (My drop rate is 1 every 4-5 hours, fucking ridiculous)
---
&gt; Who would win?
---
&gt; A well designed encounter
---
&gt; or
---
&gt; Six joining allies bois
---
Ah, I see you are a man of culture as well.
---
Have you tried the recluse I heard it is really good
---
It almost certainly costs more to make than $10, because it is limited run.
---
We only went for 200k anyways so that was way more than we needed.
---
What a brave Titan....
---
You should try guided raids.  We used to do them but it took longer to find a seeker half the time
---
The problem with scouts is that there isn't really encounter design or PvP maps that really let them shine. Hopefully by buffing they mean maybe some slight damage buffs, but it's more about nerfing pulse range and giving us some bigger maps to play with. If they do that then it should be fine
---
Corrupted isn't as bad as exodus crash imo
---
I would love a shotgun with a huge spread but god awful range. I’d name it The Culler. It’s normal perk would be field prep, and it’s pinnacle perk would be Crowd Control. Shots from this weapon have a very wide spread and very high damage, but with extremely aggressive damage drop off, from like ten or even five meters
---
If u go into the items description. Look top left and it breaks down each challenge. But i believe thats just solar kills on edz.
---
I was with ya till the “hard to hear from up here” bit.
---
*Hunters
---
My character: "fuck this shit I'm out"
---
🤡
---
I loved that strike.
---
Grenade solar kills
---
I like Savathûn's Song, but I can't stand Exodus Down.
---
Thx for the reply. I have tried by just selecting the solar subclass. However, it doesn't seem to work for some weird reason.
---
Hey. Thx for the reply. Im gonna give it a try.
---
Savathun’s Somg is the best strike in the game.
---
No problem. Hope it helps
---
Bru this thing is straight from hell
---
Geomags are great but this thing can output UNGODLY amounts of damage with the One Two Punch build. Easily an under 10 second kill at one to two stacks.
---
I know that much lol I was trying to Warlock my way in xD
---
Weapon final blows as solar class
---
Liars handshake obliterates everything. I Solo Flawessed Shattered Throne using Liars Handshake, an “One-Two punch” raid shotgun, and Tractor Cannon.
---
As long as you can keep the Combination Blow at x3, you’ll be doing absurd amounts of damage. And you can immediately get melee charges back with your dodge, and you get health back per melee ability kill. You can run into large groups of enemies and be relatively safe.
---
YES!!!
---
Weasel is an error code that kicks you from the entire game back to the starting menu
---
I know it’s better I was just curious as to by how much
---
Winters Guile doesn’t come close.
---
Slideshot and quick draw tho
---
Either that or a random Fusion Rifle shot......on that note 1000 voices is another weapon I'm starting not to like next to Jotunn.
---
Its not opinion its straight up facts lmao
---
Alright laugh all you want until you hear that thunderbolt in crucible
---
I just turn to them slowly as I have my two index fingers on the left and right bumpers ready to press them both at the same time
---
The Dark Blade! Easily one of the best strikes Bungie has come up with. I love fighting the Blades in Reckoning because Alak-hul’s theme plays during that fight.
---
Well a hell of a lot of people seem to disagree. Just saying.
---
What say you, Boramir
---
I panic nova bomb
---
I don’t know dude.  I knocked all those types of requirements out without even trying for them.  I’d say keep doing it
---
Cammy is head of that society. It’s kinda like the stone cutters, except they’re not as good at singing.
---
It is not and never will be on battle net. The game is moving off of battle net. Now if you have base game (and if you have year 2 dlc) that stuff will transfer and so will your character and progression.
---
Awesome! Thank you
---
I doubt it, but it depends on how the trophies are triggered. If for example the 'Reach Level X' trophy triggers from the act of leveling up, then no. If when the game loads and the trophy system just checks to see if the requirement is met, then yes.
---
The internet is littered with this shit, and it's not just Destiny-related stuff, either. You look up something that can be explained in a few lines of text, and the first few results google pops up with are almost always multiple 11-minute videos (because durr, youtube metrics) of random idiots advertising their twitch streams and showing random, unrelated in-game footage.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Hi there I'm randomwindowlicker2010, and this is a video explaining whether you should cut the red wire or the blue wire. You should check out my twitch stream at &lt;insert url here&gt; for all kinds of window-licking action! 
---
&lt;insert 10 minutes of random idiocy here&gt;
---
So now that you understand which windows I prefer to lick when riding the short bus to school, let's get back to the issue of defusing that bomb! Assuming it hasn't exploded and killed you already, you cut the purple wire!
---
If the bomb in question doesn't HAVE a purple wire, try watching three more of my other videos to figure out which wire to cut!
---
At least I can run for 5s with my arcstrider
---
Fried got 7 exotics in 2 days. I was playing with him the entire time.
---
For what reason? The 2019 armor and glows look better. This is something redundant that will never be unless they are implemented as ornaments or reprised like the EP armor.
---
It was now I'm stuck grinding for the Meyrin shader after getting the other 3 shaders practically in 1 to 2 ignitions at the proper forges.
---
"This is fu*@@×! Awesome! #WOOOOOOO"
---
This
---
How is the game moving off of a platform it was never on?
---
Guess I’m not here then
---
Nah you should be able to get it
---
They would be a better final boss than Ghaul ever was. I used to run that strike in D1 along with the axe guy (whos name i forgot) all the time with my friends.
---
Zuzuvala
---
Apparently I needed to pick up the pursuit from shaxx during SotD tho, or am I still fine if I don't have it?
---
It’s better than beloved because it has max range
---
I'm pretty sure I picked it up just like 2 or 3 days ago so you should be fine
---
Hahahahah
---
Please explain to me how any of the things in this post relate to what you just said.
---
Alright, thanks
---
Didn't someone shoot at his house?

Why I turned off chat and messages.

Agreed

My god Gru looks more like an Ao Oni than himself.

To what? This screenshot's on my computer

Its like a hazing ritual at this point

Deflecting and projecting. Another classic soyboy combo 😂😂

Smh y'all forgetting.

We told Spider 'Deal'

Disruption break, tap the trigger

Let me guess

Yet another pair of armor that is only needed for infusion

Solstice Armor != Sleep

okay rick and morty fanboy

Third tree striker? Lol
---
[Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/a8e5il/start_to_finish_all_of_the_steps_necessary_to) a complete step by step guide. 
---
Only thing I can guess is maybe you haven't actually done a heavy MG frame? Though I don't think that should actually stop you from progressing.
---
I'll keep googling
---
This would be great if it reduces the UI load times on console. Sadly, it most likely will make it worse.
---
"But I like using the big laser beam!"
---
Didn't they move the pursuits tab to where it is now to make it a bit faster on console?
---
i didn't get it til my 38th frame...i feel ur pain
---
Warmind is, especially from the hive storyline. If you plan on playing shadow keep, CoO will probably tie in a lot, so I’d recommend both. They have around 5 missions each afaik, so not a huge burden!
---
Geomag noises intensify
---
Or you could shoot then in Center mass with a weapon that will crit enough damage to one shot them and be done with it in a single shot, that is what i do most of the time
---
*Laughs in Geomag*
---
I dare you to try and stop me.
---
It was the bond brothers strike in D1 during The Taken King
---
Now this is some stuff to jack off to
---
When I actually get forsakened
---
Fair enough 300 is a a bit high and I agree that they deserve to get payed I'm just saying that with 60 being the standard it might be hard to convince new players
---
Worst super ever
---
Did it on first wave of EP. Just wait few moments until enough mobs appear and throw grenade near yourself, they will try to approach you and die. Plus use the bottom tree that makes grenades last two times longer.
---
You still have a chance of the Gambit Prime shotgun from dropping from Blocker multikills. I doesn’t always come Curated, and has a chance of dropping with One-Two punch. Sorry, the way I worded it makes it seem like the Curated comes with it.
---
The “examine point a” one is top tier. Smash through 10 of those in 5 mins or less
---
Good job man! (: just mountaintop left for me, God recluse is so much fun
---
Best strike is Warden of Nothing
---
But jade rabbit is already insane.
---
Hunters have a dash and Warlocks have their teleport, what do Titans get? Absolutely zero mobility. What they lack in movement they make up in their super which I don't find is that big of a problem. When people are running around with one-eyed mask and recluses I don't think striker Titan is the number one priority on the nerf list. Yes I do think it lasts a bit long and can have weird hitboxes some times but it isn't THAT bad.
---
Yes
---
No
---
I go past signs like this all the time and I am a bug user of austringer. Hadnt thought lf this. Now ill be unable to unthink it.
---
Thank you
---
Pretty sure someone made an edit of it and put it on Reddit, I wish I had the link.
---
Especially with a one two punch shotgun
---
You're expecting a little bit too much, mate. The only fsctors that matter in comp is your current glory and geographical location, nothing else.
---
With combination blow + One-Two Punch + Cross Counter + Tractor Cannon you do max damage
---
Plenty of people have already been banned for it throughout the years on destiny and many other games 
---
Im not saying a player market system would be the stupidest idea ever but the economy would be really weird imo.
---
I'm using one with demolitioner and code of the commander, it's the tits.
---
They haven't increased the drop rate at all yet. They fix Reckoning on September 1st my guy. All this patch did was tune the solstice armor requirements and make some new emblems available in collections.
---
Oh ok cool
---
Try r/destinysherpa as well
---
The economy is already really weird... there’s already currencies in game that are essentially pointless IE weapon telemetry
---
Hopefully
---
....i was the sniper on widow’s court 9 out of 10 times....
---
Her benevolence with hidden hand and shortgaze, oof
---
I've thought about this since year 1 of D1.. I used to think it's a good idea. However now that Bungie are making the push to be full action MMO.... honestly I understand why they dont HOWEVER I do want to point out World of Warcraft and ESO allows trades for most everything including currencies. I personally wouldnt bet on them doing this and putting it in HOWEVER I dont see the harm in it apart from a few things, collections would need to leave, and the player trading would have to realize that they wouldn't be playing as long. 
---
I feel like they could pull it off an most players would not trade everything with everyone because people who are invested in the game would want to earn their gear and chances are many wouldnt want to trade, but I dont see why it COULDNT work. But big things in the current game, like collections, would have to leave the game.
---
I dont like it..... I love it!!! 💙
---
To be fair these double lunge distances are thanks to the Arc Empowerment of Solstice. 
---
You're covering twice the distance than normal.
---
I pulled the numbers from Aztecross Gaming on YouTube, it didn't look like they were using Tractor Cannon. The video shows a, basically, side to side comparison between Handshake and Wormgod's for overall DPS that could be done solo.
---
I'd link to the video but I'm not certain on the sub rules and looking at them on mobile is sort of a pain.
---
Finally some ideas and creative responses and not just a negative response, I appreciate this!
---
One can say..*mini sparrow ride*
---
Is the drop rate really that low? My brother kept going on about how he really wanted one while i had like four sitting in the vault. He's got one now but maybe i was just lucky with drops.
---
It's so simple, even a titan can do it
---
Well since the raid of shadowkeep is set In the black garden, I would say it’s safe to assume that the vex would play a significant role in the endgame of shadowkeep and would use some lore from CoO. 
---
It’s been speculated that the vex is the underlying enemy to the main stories hive , sorta like taken to the scorn in forsaken
---
They really went in a good direction at the end of s1 with alak hul and shield bros. I wish they would make more strikes like those
---
lmao you are the problem.. you know research has been done when the ttks of certain guns archetype dont change as drastic in some cases not at all. its a 5% buff with is negligible on a lot of meta archetype one being handcannons.. you also DO NOT get overshield or the damage buff until you kill the marked target, which if you are dying to the titan with no buff or shield then thats on your skill not the helmet man.. it also only targets one person at a time that wants to choose to engage you, chances are if you are taking engagements that give the titan his mark advantage then thats once again on you, and since its only one at a time any fight even remotely quick after that turn the helmet even more negligible in that scenario as it has a cooldown when it cant target another player and if you shoot the oversheild gen its stops it immediatly and if you are losing battles with a titan that was just nothing because he got the perk to proc on someone who shot him and has low health after he one the battle at which two of his perks havent even proced yet then thats once again not on the helmet thats on your skill.. you losing 50 hp battles isnt the helmet to blame but even if he doesnt engage he now is forced into downtime with a very minor shield to roam around for a short time as it almost enforces rengageing disadvantage now.. hell the biggest adavantage of the whole helmet is the mark and some fight thats also negligible if you both commit which also happens for often and i can think of a helmet that also gives a good mark advantage like foetracer and a subclass with pure off radar intrinsic, no aim assist, no cooldown and invisible along with wallhacks on another class after you get a kill also.. hmmmmm. but yea oem is the problem over everything else?? riiiight...
---
heres another example of sheeping someone. cammy cakes lmao! as your opinion is obviously naive to oem and your are probably another one of those bias average players who gets killed by a titan in crucible wearing oem and goes straight into sheep dick riding oem is overpowered train when in reality it probably wasnt even proced on you lmao.. 
---
also funny in your descrption you dont even know now oem works lmao..  by your details of calling these aspects of overpowered.. sorry to say but your comment screams exactly what im saying.. 
---
you dont even know how oem works and then you sheep a big crucible name as viability because he says so.. youve got to be fuckin kidding me.. thanks for proving my point for me youre a great example to use..
---
oh on that cammy cake guy yea i remember besting and beating him in a few rumbles then goin back and watching the vod after i found out it was him just to hear him bitch about me everytime i killed him the vod... but yea you ride that cammy dick brother his voice sure does hold a lot of weight.. "if cammy say op then op" lmao this made my day..
---
sorry you have to be the example but im done being polite
---
Maul's Maulers... still my favorite Titan arms.
---
They mentioned changing things that circumvent the ammo economy too, honestly im expecting both the Well and Lunas to be nerfed come September
---
Legendary shards and Enhancement cores. Get as many resources as you can.
---
Ok thamk you
---
Sometimes I do.
---
Sometimes I don't, because that would put me in the sightline of those witches. And I am playing a Warlock. I can't help but jump high, it is how it is meant to me. ;)
---
(Also, much better control and shooting when you run past them.)
---
Is that le monarque?
---
i got 3 drops yesterday during my 10 gambit matches for the solstice armor.
---
Well it is called mountaintop, and not brief walk up a hill?
---
That was one of the best parts, I loved his commentary.
---
its all about the RNG lol
---
"Help me Anakin! The Jedi are taking over!"
---
Yeah someone needs to balance those patrols
---
Kill 3000 in strikes with a kinetic weapon while using the daily solstice subclass.  
---
Complete 5 challenges: Milestones etc.  
---
Jump in the crucible.
---
F
---
maybe, but i think i'm getting super unlucky with my teammates!
---
Bruh, I bought two destiny 1 with all the dlc and seasons. Bought two destiny two with every dlc. Thats a lot of money. Now I personally think it was a smart move to separate bounties from the inventory but B O I! If you mess up the game that I invested all that money and countless hours into you best clench your cheeks because I will have no mercy.
---
Literally same. Year one was absolute trash (got to 330 on titan/warlock/hunter, multiple prestige completions) and just like EVERYONE said, as soon as the season pass ended, random rolls and armor updates came back with the next expansion.
---
Ouch
---
Feels bad man
---
Ok thx mine is either gobenji_34 or Ben Thompson (it’s my dads account
---
they're called boots you they go on your feet
---
1v1!!
---
I know it's frustrating to get killed by those weapons, but it's quickplay, people go there to just play pvp and use whatever weapons they want. Since competitive is in a bad state imo and to many others, but not all, of course they're going quickplay instead. Also, if one has been through the mountaintop grind, of course he/she is going to use it.
---
Those are great on Titan. You just zip back and forth between the 2 zones.
---
Did... did those tether shots OHK those guardians?!?  I want!
---
I'm mad enough to say I wish I'd see them more in Crucible. I know, meta and all, but I love Auto Rifles. Sought the Suros Regime for months and decided to go for Breakneck instead. Hazard of the Cast is pretty good too, which is what got me to Breakneck. Sweet Business is fun. Just fun.  Even my Misfit with Extended Mag and Backup Mag is great fun.
---
Mine look opposite: I'm alright at Control but get my butt kicked in Clash. Of course I mostly load into losing Clash matches that are already because some asswad left early.
---
I was not aware of that, Thanks for the heads up on that
---
Cool bro I was 1800 last season then I received a ban from destiny because I had a bad internet connection. Still don't know how that's possible must be because my matchmaking usually connects me 2 European players and I live in south Africa. T_T I'll def not play comp again tho.
---
Was about to ask! Great video
---
you can, you just need to finish luna's howl first
---
If you can top frag, try Rumble instead. Top 3 is considered a win by the game.
---
Not enough Titans.
---
But good nonetheless
---
I think they patched that. Don’t quote me though
---
Rocks are just stationary Titans
---
i was about to say the same thing, too much spike.
---
One word: Dedication
---
Oh and my mic is broken so I can’t talk but I’m trying to find my old one
---
When your bank is draining, you have no special or heavy ammo, and your teammates are, as usual, doing nothing about it.
---
*grabs sentinel shield* "fine. I'll do it myself."
---
I really like auto-loading holster on shotguns tho (in PvE) you can just run around destroying everything without reloading, you should give it a try !
---
It is an English only clan
---
As long as you speak English yeah
---
Destiny 1 never came out on PC ... CONSOLE EXCLUSIVE ...
---
Nice
---
I’ve found if you would have missed the shot, but bullet magnetism gives it to you, then Reversal/Mulligan can still proc. I’ve had Mulligan proc on my Beloved on like three kills lol, don’t have Revoker yet but I assume it’s the same deal

He’s making a joke about it being exclusive the Epic Games Store for a year. A lot of people refuse to use EGS. To be honest, it’s a dumb controversy and refusing to buy a game on EGS is just shooting you self in the foot for no reason haha
---
This is the best pvp shotty in the game, i would even be fine with auto loading if it had quickdraw but.. that range is from smoothbore which is trash
---
NNNNOOOOO TANKY!  don't leave him behind!
---
Your opinion is as bad as your movie, Howard.
---
It's also got the cosmetic factor. Anything that glows is cool in my book.
---
Also someone contact a doctor about this boner Bungie has for asymmetrical armor on Hunters. Enough already, it's physically painful at this point that they can't just make a single set with symmetry.
---
No, it's just an Epic Store exclusive until April 2020
---
nice.
---
What do you mean wait on the reset? weekly or when season 8 comes? And what does the reset do exactly?
---
Your life privileges have been

*Revoked*.

Can you make the spikes much larger for a strictly humor POV?
---
Callum was a whole another can of worms. Look him up.
---
Oh yeah
---
I forget that people still crying about that
---
I made a post on DTG about a finisher move idea and somebody went through and downvoted every comment.  Reddit is just weird.
---
Strike wasn’t to hard but it was fun
---
I got a masterworks range w/ opening shot and rampage for the nightfall is this a good one?
---
Are you using an external hard drive?  If so it might be downloading onto it or on your Xbox. I have a SSD drive got an 80gig update. Looked at my storage and had 2 installs for some reason.
---
You are correct my kind fellow.
---
Agreed lol. Love my bad juju
---
What cloak is this? It's beautiful!
---
Striker titan, but then it has to be 10 mins long :p
---
Don't disrespect the former taken king
---
&gt;Is this what you do for fun? 
---
Why yes, it is.

---
It’s the curated roll, above average if you can live without quickdraw. Not godly though
---
I remember when all the people on YouTube told us to not buy it, wait for something like Red Death (little did they know, I got mine from a legendary engram, hah, fools) I bought mine, and when everyone realized how godly it was, I felt very fortunate to have not payed attention.
---
Hahah slo mo 😋
---
That was me lol
---
I'm not to clued up on the dreaming city stuff. What exactly did this entail?
---
And the recluse shall take the leftovers.
---
Scouting patrol is my favorite honestly.
---
Lol
---
Savage. Well playd.
---
Ahhh the memories of using the hive sword to solo over the bridge. Then soloing Crota with said sword. Such fond memories. That was a fun raid.
---
Ahh I see, we did the 200k nightfall and I got it dropped masterworked and didn’t know. Not a shotgun fan. Thanks man!
---
Can the Hunter one please be symetric?!??
---
Whens Iron Banner?
---
My friend quit Destiny because of this day, and the elitism, and Skolas (because you were nobody without the Gjallarhorn for that fight). I got mine a couple weeks prior and I did beat him (but had to use it). No, he didn't buy the g-horn either. Just straight up uninstalled.
---
happaned to me yesterday, told my mate that there were 3 guys around the corner, he went around the corner and got obliterated
---
Hey bro. Yes man, for sure it's worth it. I sat on the first legendary edition of this game for about a yr without touching it and only leveling one character to about lvl 18. Recently picked it up, restarted from the beginning and found one other person via reddit, created a clan for black people only..., 🤣I'm black this is funny but only a joke.
---
Yeah i think with all I'm reading about the changes coming, the armor 2.0, the sorta free 2 play model they're coming out with pay to win available, it'll be good to get in now and play the story through instead of trying to watch a YouTube summation in a few weeks.. Play the game, especially if you still own it.
---
That’s neat. I had no idea lol clever
---
I actually good lucky and managed to buy it the first time, greatest thing I ever did with my life
---
A titan with over shield from oem should win a gun fight. They can trade shots evenly and win when they should have been a cleanup kill, if the titan dies that's just a complete failure on their part. Yeah a player can miss their shots and get killed because of it, doesn't mean oem isn't fundamentally op.
---
In all fairness dude you sound extremely biased as well. Just biased towards the opposite side. I don’t have a dog in this fight but you coming on here and being nasty and hypocritical because someone dared insult your precious video game is not a very good look for you or the game you’re trying to defend.
---
It spawns outside the ship, I just took it all the way
---
After that the Menagerie drops some pretty decent gear I believe.
---
I'd love to see some doomguy esque armor.  i mean, come on, you will be wading knee deep in hive territory and slaughtering them in droves.  if that doesn't deserve Doomguy armor i don't know what does.  (I really like this though)
---
That makes sense, D2 has different maps which on their own are pretty expansive so that makes sense
---
It was a real game. I'm also suprised but i won
---
I was there. I remember.
---
#BringItBack
---
or, you know, you could just unplug his wifi
---
It does one tap lol I do it all the time
---
Throw on well or radiance with geomagnetic stabilizers and watch them freak
---
Congrats fellow dad with 2 kids! No easy task.
---
Shit sucks, I got left 1 to 4 yesterday..🤦‍♀️
---
Mostly the playerbase has been divisive no pun intended
---
Grinding your solstice gear right now is probably the fastest way to get to max. The set is 750 fully upgraded. Just make sure you are max level or close to it. Green (First) set is 700 at level 50.
---
Definitely, I’ve almost unlocked majestic on my warlock, but I’m only power level ~500 and I read that if I want the majestic set to be 750 then I need to first get the 690 gear from the invitation quest.
---
Imagine year 1 Destiny and that phrase people used to describe it. “As wide as an ocean, as deep as a puddle”. I played it for the first time in ages and quickly got turned off again because it wasn’t very interesting.
---
Rude. And FYI it’s the best movie ever.
---
Nailed it!
---
Damn, i remember missing that because i couldn't find my game disc.
---
I wasn’t shitting on his soon to be preferred platform, I’m shitting on the fact he’s going to be a hunter, and tbh I’m not even shitting on him, it’s a complete joke.
---
The week after solstice ends I believe and yes it’s confirmed you can still MW after the event ends
---
Because hunters are the easiest to use class and the most OP.
---
Back before everything that was any good got nerfed
---
Will be updating the post as it goes.
---
I solo queued to Recluse. The only thing it made apparent is that Bungie desperately needs to revamp matchmaking. The seasonal reset is 100% not the way, I shouldn’t play against people that struggled to reach Fabled every single season.
---
Is this genuine???
---
Seems a little fishy to me.
---
Exotic*
---
Unless I've missed something, Steam doesn't have exclusive games barring games Valve have made themselves.
---
Are you being seriously
---
I'd like to believe it ngl
---
They just said it. Anything you aquire after shadowkeep launches will be armor 2.0. so if you go and play scourge of the past Last Wish escalation protocol or get armor from Fail-Safe after shadowkeep launches, it will be 2.0.
---
Yes sir. The stream just stated that.
---
Fucking pajamas.
---
Not American
---
Can you explain the Georgia thingy?
---
Btw I love the name lol, also if you're already there just add me and I'll accept on my phone. My name is ~sigh~... My name is AnalSepageMilk... It's a long story 😅
---
I see this as an absolute win
---
Firebase echo
---
And we didn't know just how important it was until it was too late
---
Yes.
---
Get your feet off the table. You're gonna kick that mug
---
Strange it’s not the Titan. 🤔
---
I've been stuck at 1200-1400 for the last month
---
Basically all Eververse armor is now a Transmog
---
It's terrible and Everytime someone leaves it's always countdown
---
I love when people start to realize they are being an ass...so they go all in an start cursing people out for drawing attention to their douchery
---
YES!!
---
Okay dude
---
150 packages and still not the rolls i need lol. The drop of packages to solstice key fragments ratio is ridiculous
---
There's 6 expansions currently available.
---
Base Game, Curse of Osiris, Warmind.. those are the Vanilla content, which are all included with a purchase of "Forsaken" (You'll be able to get all of these for free After the release of the Shadowkeep expansion in October. - Forsaken not included)
---
After forsaken, there's Black Armory, Season of the Drifter, and Season of Opulence (Which we're currently on)
---
The next expansion is Shadowkeep, which so far seems to be rumored to overhaul alot of things. It might be comparable to "Forsaken" in terms of content. It comes out on October 1st.
---
The game has no pay to win mechanics whatsoever, but there is a cash shop with vanity items/skins, emotes, etc.
---
Idk about this. Warframe is great and I've heard good things about division 2. Screw anthem though.
---
Blessed post
---
You should start interviewing the community and ask them if they know how to inspect gear! That way you can either debunk or confirm your statement on the matter
---
Honestly, why would you waste an exotic on a heavy weapon?
---
RIP Armaments
---
They were in D1?
---
All hail saint 14
---
Saint 14 smiles from above
---
They should make a dungeon where shaxx guides us to a fallen who is stockpiling all of our d1 vaulted weapons and armor.
---
You're right, my bad. Missed the message to the mod team. Your post has been reinstated.
---
Its *really* bad on Io. In the terrabase, beed vex kills, there are no vex in the entire area because of the PE.
---
This.. is a picture of a meme. Why didn’t you save the meme?
---
Smoothbore REALLY makes your pellet spread awful. That’s why they give you range to compensate
---
They were technically called exotic shards.
---
Hulk hogan leg drop.
---
Obi wan gif "finger slide"
---
Giant cartoon hammer
---
Knights of the round from ff7
---
Oh, I thought I lost some of my memory cells there. 😂
---
Yes but you can buy more at any time through the collections tab once you've picked up one it's unlocked and you can obtain as many as you want
---
No I’m not using an external hard drive.
---
The Boys on Amazon
---
No, because you likely will not be able to cross-save between two platforms if you do not in the first place
---
why do you say that?
---
Weapons of light is coming back
---
I feel like you can't use blink that often. Gotta be hacks
---
...wot?
---
Yea bro they’re bringing weapons of light back to bubble even if outside
---
I have all three characters done and I work a 8 hour job during the week. 
---
You have time.
---
You can play on battlenet until 10/01
---
#WAAAAAAAT
---
Xur used to be so much cooler, the excitement of waking up to see what the new meta was gonna be for a week or so. Ahhhh the good ol days
---
I KNOW RIGHT (how tf do u do the big text)
---
Yo can I have some friends to play with?
---
#a hashtag at the beginning. goes as long as you want until you hit enter.
---
like so.
---
#holy shit
---
I remember buying 22. Good times.
---
Now use both to obliterate boss
---
I'm just assuming, when bungie did the live stream today they picked it up from the gunsmith and it wasn't fully masterworked . They had to upgrade it so the armor had the full 10 points
---
Where does it say that? I’ve read all of the official cross save info
---
Yeah.
---
Artifacts will grant a boost. There's a screenshot post someone put up here.
---
i got mine on my first raid in VOG
---
Mine rhyme with "Smosmirus," and "Smunfinished game..."
---
That’s a fair point. Didn’t feel any different than solo Q tbh. I’d rather have someone I at least enjoy the company of though.
---
Pepperidge Farm remembers!
---
Ugh... This kind of customization is what many people like, but not me. To me this is just more shit I HAVE to do to stay competitive in pvp, and not be considered a burden in endgame pve. If I wanted to juggle a fuckton of stats I'd play Diablo or something. It's what turns me off about Division. When I play a looter shooter I just want to shoot, loot, and nothing else.
---
I soloed recluse and mountain top in different seasons.  
---
Here's a tip: You know that bottom tree strike with oem and 5 super mods? Be the guy, it gives you free wins.
---
Last time I played d1 also :(
---
I’m ok but I constantly end up against people who can kill me the second I spawn
---
There’s just always someone there
---
Always
---
What about class ability regeneration? Everything got his stat equivalent, that shows how fast its recharging, but not the class ability regen through paragon mods?  
---
If I understand correctly: discipline mod (for grenade regen) is the "old" ordnance mod, strengh mod (for melee) is the impact mod and intellect mod (for super) is the super mod. Did they forgot about the class ability? :)  
---
hunter here
---
I’ll take all of them for 100k glimmer
---
What hiccups are you referring to? curious
---
Wait what. Motes of light are coming back?
---
And like a week or two later they nerfed it . Right? Or am I remembering this wrong?
---
Ascendant shards those are not motes of light did u play d1
---
Yes I did, it's just been a while
---
You can do it after the event ends and still be able to masterwork the set. Confirmed by Bungie.
---
You can masterwork after the event is over!
---
You can complete shattered throne after the event is done, they moved the event for like 2 weeks as well
---
You have to remember they are nerfing well's current functionality.
---
It shouldn't have to break the game to be viable.
---
Okay I googled it and I remembered the orange ones more than these. They do look similar to motes of light though you can't blame me
---
I’ve read way back when Destiny came out that they wanted the hunter’s design to be asymmetrical in general, kinda rogue like.
---
My favorite class is the hunter class and I absolutely hate asymmetrical stuff so I feel you. 
---
:(
---
It’s been there for a while
---
From a gameplay standpoint I’d say go warlock I think it’s more enjoyable than hunters
---
Thanks for doing the math.
---
Why not both? Thundercrash is simultaneously the least safe and the least damaging one-off super as far as I know, and also bottom tree Striker is fuckin stupid
---
Source: am Titan. Like punch. But Thunderpunch make me sad.
