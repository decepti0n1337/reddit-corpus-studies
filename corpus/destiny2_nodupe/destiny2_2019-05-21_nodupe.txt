You can't buy it outright if you haven't beaten Leviathan for that week.

Yup, it's said that they nerfed the trench barrel to 3 or 4 shots ( cants remember). So now you gotta keep on punching every once in a while and you loose a little time on total DPS.
---
If the beautiful 999999 damage disappear, i'll go mad
---
Yerp, made a joke about that in the comments, but seems like people don't get the joke :/
---
Yes
---
That really is america's ass tho
---
It goes double for no people with stereos and double no for ice cream.
---
Whoever edited that flair... smart.
---
So easy to counter lol and I have it so you can‚Äôt say I don‚Äôt know shit
---
It‚Äôs not edited though?
---
r/gatekeeping
---
I don't think I check them often enough. It says "It's both" which is probably right.
---

---
That stupidity from my mind aside. Congrats! You have way too much time and I wish I had half of it.
---
The idea of Thanos' galaxy conquering henchmen being given pause by Black Widow/Hawkeye also irks me 
---
Thanos babying Hulk into submission, but being stalled by Cap was also a wtf for me
---
Congrats man. I have 100s of raid clears now, but my first felt like such an amazing accomplishment. :) Gg
---
"And my dad works at Destiny so if you try to argue with me he'll ban you" head ass.
---
My titan brother is one hell of a chonker. I‚Äôm over here in my Wing Discipline with Clouds at Sea like ‚Äúyikes bro‚Äù
---
PS+ version is the very base game only. Lvl 20 is max.
---
Doesn‚Äôt really make sense in this situation dumbass
---
k
---
Ahh ok. It‚Äôs called ‚Äúforsaken‚Äù and has the missions from the forsaken campaign, I guess you just can‚Äôt actually level?
---
The game gets updated with all the files regardless if you have the expansions or not. That way you can keep playing with others.
---
(Me jumping into Competitive to try for The Mountaintop this Season)
---
Oh that makes sense then. I‚Äôll go ahead and purchase forsaken then, I just didn‚Äôt want to spend 60$ if I already owned it through ps+
---
Oh man I didn't expect the drifter's face I cracked up so bad
---
Yikes dude
---
Use a sword to put yourself in 3rd person
---
Yeah.... dope capes
---
Looks like dark souls Smoug gone really wrong or right lol
---
Oh wow that is actually a really good idea. Thank you
---
You don‚Äôt make any sense lol got em
---
Mag howl has always done extra body shot damage. Currently, it allows for a crit-crit-body .67 second TTK. After the nerf, LH and NF will have a .8 second TTK, and mag howl will not apply on headshots. How is that not a nerf?
---
Pro strats straight from King‚Äôs Fall
---
Picked up the forsaken DLC but passed on the annual pass.  Looks like I got the other 2 DLC‚Äôs as well.  Glanced at a few reviews and it says this is the best DLC for the Destiny franchise. That‚Äôs exciting to hear.  Looking forward to the grind!! Thanks again for sharing your experience with me :)
---
Nyet!
---
Magnificent
---
Very cool üëèüëè
---
I don't know if it's just me or celestial nighthawk feels like shit right now. 2959 damage on primeval in gambit??? wtf? (i tried to headshot)
---
It is? Oh no! I'm sorry, I told people this because 3 other people told me that was the case. I had thought Redrix's 5 resets was the only rank related step that counted retroactively if you did it in a past season but finished the rest of the quest in a future one.
---
facts
---
First enemy tethered gives you 10% super
---
Next gives 8%
---
Next gives 6.5%
---
Next gives 5.2%
---
Next gives 4.2%
---
...
---
Diminishing returns. Super will be returned in reducing amounts
---
It‚Äôs absolutely wrong, if you hit fabled this season, it counts your account as hitting fable permanently, regardless of what your glory is
---
what game?
---
Who that?
---
Now try to reflect it with mid tree arcstrider
---
The fool that sniped him thru the barricade and bubble
---
Oh, that is true but not exactly what this person is asking. This person was asking about *next* season. I have been told that it won't count if you do not reach the fabled step within the season you reached fabled.
---
"Oh... Yup. That's not Dawnblade"
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying, he‚Äôs all set. The step will auto complete once you reach it if you ever hitting fabled before getting to it
---
Thundercrash can't be deflected
---
No I know, it would be kinda interesting to see though.
---
Props for admitting when you're wrong. I still disagree with the RPM change not being a nerf though. A 180 RPM 2h1b is always going to be more advantageous than a 150, since 180 is significantly faster. Obviously, both LH and NF will still be very strong, and their chunk damage will be increased. However, the more relaxed .80 TTK allows for much more opportunity to outplay the user and makes the guns less forgiving of missing shots. It's cool if you don't see it that way, that's just where I'm coming from and I'm confused as to how a slower TTK is an advantage. I'm interested to know your thoughts.
---
Do you know what seasons mean in this game?
---
Bruh destiny was made for and by casuals
---
Grow fat from strange guardian!
---
That‚Äôs just condescending. Yes I do.
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter what season you hit fabled, as long as you hit 2100 all pinnacle weapon quests will be either checked off or the step will auto complete once you reach that step.
---
Seems so serene. Not cursed st all. Beautiful
---
D1 still has a number of features I think are superior to D2, but there are certainly some QoL things I would have a hard time going back on.
---
Not trying to be a fun police, but this is a destiny 2 subreddit.
---
You can post D1 stuff on r/destinythegame (they also post D2 stuff), so please do that in the future.
---
What gauntlets?
---
Shaxx Approves üëç

I know this is a late comment, but I have to say it somewhere. I completed solo twice in a row with one death each time, and on the third time guitarred during Dul Incaru on a flawless run. Was so mad. Got it forth time tho!

Whisper never destroyed in PvP. It always was a PvE weapon.
---
alright thanks
---
You can buy the base game from GameStop online and pick up in store for $1.98. Still have to buy the expansion but saves a few bucks
---
All i need is getaway artist
---
109 comment, and 0 upvotes. Damn
---
OHNO. His ass...
---
....
---
C'mon now, can we REALLY say that was possible if they were competent?
---
?
---
Thor made a surprise attack, and was at the peak of his power, channeling all his fury into a single shot
---
We already saw that even Wanda was capable of battering back the stones.
---
The second time around there was no surprise, and Thor was afraid, and out of shape. 
---
I dunno, it all lines up for me okay tbh... Why Thor didn't just Bifrost Thanos away seems stranger to me
---
To all of you that‚Äôs wondering, the app is basically a  ripoff of Pixel Gun 3D
---
Non-180 hand canons are horrible on console, not at all fun to play with.
---
No I didn‚Äôt I was actually looking for you guys to say your best stats so I could compare them to mine.
---
To be honest, this was some of the most fun I've had in PvP in Destiny  2. I'll miss the Iron Burden, but right now? I miss my bed.
---
Oh my lord! That balance! Ugh! That's gorgeous!
---

I SAID GO BACK!

Now I'm curious, is there a sight that gives a number of how many users own a specific weapon?

Uhhh Gambit Prime? That's a multiplayer mode that introduced 2 new maps. And that's this current season that we are in right now.
---
I never do my milestones any more. Lol. Milestones are
---
So 2018.
---
Am I still the top comment ?
---
No way
---
But does it _feel_ like the Last Word ?
---
Yeah it allows you just to immediately aim for a spot instead of wilding trying to aim right at his gun. Let me know if it works for you if you end up trying it out!
---
Why is it red?
---
I still don't have it either after countless strikes. Hang in there friend.
---
Back when sniper rifles were actually good.
---
Let me just pull out my Grimoire Anthology
---
Hey just curious what was the shotgun you were using I‚Äôve never seen it before
---
Hardly. I saw like one grenade? Shaxx would be disappointed. Though I doubt he'd say anything given the slaughter he just witnessed.
---
The best action scenes happen on the frontier!!
---
You too Guardian!!
---
He does so much damage it can basically one shot Rivin in all honesty. I‚Äôm pretty sure they saw the damage number for Enkaar and just put it to max
---
F
---
Last night‚Äôs newest episode. S16 E6.
---
Sounds like you've never played D1
---
In Gambit. F*ck the Crucible. No one likes it. I hope it doesn't come back in D3. Sue me.
---
People getting clapped by Luna after its nerfed: I tHoUgHt It WaS nErFeD?!?!!!?!!???!!? BuNgEe!!! I gOt KiLlEd By LuNa!!!!!!!!
---
Bungie: it‚Äôs okay my casual child, I‚Äôll nerf it again to make it easier on you, Luna‚Äôs howl is now a 110 rpm handcanon, and mag how only affects 1 shot from your gun.
---
See for me it‚Äôs the getaway artist, but I get where you‚Äôre coming from.
---
Bold of you to assume I'm wearing pants.
---
GIVE HIM THE KNEE
---
Whatd the day?
---
*pops Golden gun* *Jotun'd during animation*
---
I was expecting you to drop the gun and punch him to death, but I'm not disappointed tho
---
Rebind block to middle click in settings.
---
END HIM RIGHTLY
---
Darn I was asleep when this happened.
---
Would've absolutely jumped on here XD
---
Seems that way.
---
SAME
---
Spawning in? &gt;&gt; better dodge that Jotunn fired at you as you spawned
---
Turning a corner? &gt;&gt; Jotunn in the face
---
Shooting somebody?  &gt;&gt; Jotunn in the back from the person that spawned behind you
---
PS4 iron banner this last week was literally just dodge jotunn shots on half my matches
---
Check the top comment ;D
---
Yup I know
---
Just run 3 characters through the weekly ascendant realm, nothing more you can do really, luck of the draw, although, they did increase the drop rate of the Ghost, ship and sparrow a few weeks ago, so you are more likely to get these days. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Good luck Guardian. &lt;3
---
Must be the PC...
---
Nope
---
Oof. I have been trying to grind recluse forever. Currently sitting at 1.06 k/d and my glory has dropped so far. Honestly I have stopped grinding for it because PvP in Destiny is probably the worst experience I have ever had in the gaming. I have just come to terms that I'll never get it and just moved on.
---
Fuck Bungie for putting the best PvE pinnacle weapon behind comp. Instead PvE players get a dog shit scout rifle that's absolutely useless in every regard.
---
Titans disgust me. Good clip nonetheless
---
Thanks for all the effort Guardian!
---
It's because you snitched on drifter
---
My kill clip rocket launcher would like to have a word with you.
---
Oh no I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs harder on console but knowing you‚Äôre on Xbox I guess it‚Äôs just my aim that sucks
---
nope it‚Äôs OUR fucking gun now
---
He likely did it because the whole lobby probably snitched
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
True I didn't even think of that
---
Congrats buddy!
---
Kc and ambitious assassin is really fun.
---
A little late buddy!
---
You were playing during the daily reset weren't you? And even worse today cause it's the weekly.  My game bugs if I'm playing when that happens all the time.
---
Honestly I was....that reason never crossed my mind lmao I forgot today was reset
---
Just got a kill clip + rampage Kindled Orchid...never realized how insane the combo is...probably why Kindled is the only gun that can have it from what I've been told.
---
The reason everyone loves them is because they‚Äôre necessary for a PvE god roll for almost all weapon types in the game
---
Those lines are pretty sketch. Overall kinda mediocre.
---
Low key Shaxx is a very smexy boi
---
Malfeasance and Crimson got left out of the family picture üò¢
---
Aint that the truth
---
(copied and pasted from the last time this was asked, I apologise if it is not 100% applicable to you) 
---
It's not how many times you go there, what happens when you turn in an offering rotates on a three week cycle. There are no eggs in there, only one ahamkara bone. 
---
The three week cycle is referred to as the dreaming city curse. The end game activity Shattered Throne, and the oracle offering bringing you there, are only available on the third week. To tell which curse week it is, look at the Dreaming City. [Here is an album of screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/U3CvlXm) comparing the first and third weeks. If you don't want to physically travel there, look at where Petra is. It will also say which week in super tiny print at the top of the weekly reset infographic stickied to this subreddit every week. 
---
The Strand: First, least cursed week
---
Divalian Mists: Second, middle week
---
Rheasilvia: Third, most cursed week.
---
You do not need to use voice chat or even text chat for most things besides raids, if the prospect of talking to strangers is what is putting you off from looking for others. If it's just being in proximity to other players, then I suppose there is nothing to be done about that. 
---
Whenever Reckoning has bad modifiers, I just wait until the next day.
---
That thing is hideous.
---
If that happens... shoot it... the balls will then seek out targets so you can at least salvage part of it.
---
thanks for the spoiler....
---
Anyone talked to the drifter after getting it? Has his emblem on it and he said to bring him back something.
---
I think your light is fading away mate...
---
Technically today's weekly reset (21st May) is the first time it becomes solar singe for Heroic Zero Hour
---
This would be even funnier if it weren‚Äôt so true.
---
You need to remove crucible from your title then. You also need to put an SS tier for Hammerhead since it's better than any exotic period. A tier list for gambit is kind of a waste since so many exotics are only good in a specific role and it doesn't matter what your gear is since hammerhead is better than all of them for everything but boss damage. A lot of the other weapons are just in weird spots and your choices look like you've never even seen the gambit meta list published by [warmind.io](https://warmind.io).
---
I mean how hard is it to just give them random rolls?  Keeps old content somewhat relevant;  makes content draughts less annoying too.
---
The 12 sets for that fully done reckoning badge... you are patient sir
---
Garbage that‚Äôs what that is
---
I can finally get duty bound!!
---
After the whisper ship ..... üò≥
---
Do you need a hug?
---
I miss my d1 trials gear on my warlock and titan....ugh!

Too bad no random rolls though

I actually really like this ship (shame I don't have it )
---
That‚Äôs the ship...
---
They do not, unfortunately. Apparently this was a feature they were thinking of, but Sony (currently the more dominant console) said no, so they didn't add it. Apparently the pattern of the more dominant console, whether it's Microsoft or Sony, not wanting transferrable accounts goes back many years.
---
ugh thanks sony always being the dick in every situation
---
LOL no way
---
Looks to be a waste of time
---
Oh damn I had no idea, glad I didn't bother masterworking my demigod roll yet
---
A horse
---
I feel you‚Äôre pain. I literally got it yesterday as well
---
One more favor. Can i get a thing of just drifter? Working on 3D printing a gambit coin and thought it would be cool to put that on there
---
two tries is really not enough to get an estimate, the nanite spawns range from 1-3 nanites per 4 bursts so on the first run you could have gotten better rng and hit the damage cap sooner, making up for the damage.
---
i did like 4-5 trys before catalyst and 3 with. Dmg was always the same.
---
I once tried big rift without lunar boots and had same dmg. After that i tried lunar boots + big rift and dmg was prty much the same. My base dmg per shot was 3k and got up to 5k with 1mag. With lunar rift i got up to 10k per shot
---
To each their own,  i like the Ship.
---
I do that everytime I do leviathan üòÇ
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
It hurt me right in the feelings
---
Sign out and sign back in
---
Reset or start an activity and back out. The triumph will update.
---
Got deleted asshole
---
i was not able to find the clip it only said s14 e6 which is a lie because i literally just watch it n it start with hayley n jeff wih a pregnancy test so i have no fucking clue what youre talking avout
---
Yeah! Look up a youtube video on how to start it and go on the lfg to grab and group and go through it!
---
leaving aside NF, getting to fabled is more a question of luck with matchmaking than your own skill for most players. even if you 4 stack on the way there, there's no guarantee you won't just be stomped by another 4 stack way above your skill level repeatedly
---
You are a sorry excuse for a human being.
---
You in trouble now...
---
if you find the damm clip post it
---
Wrong again. Some of us do our own homework.
---
The description for the which witch challenge is misleading. Deployable objects that are vulnerable to damage ex. Tether, ward of dawn can fail the challenge if they get hit
---
Good players who legitimately earned it are still good and will probably still kill you
---
Catalyst sucks but the ship is the coolest looking ship ever there is no other ship out there that can be it
---
***Sarcasm***
---
this is me every time i return to clear out postmaster but forget to turn in my weapon frames
---
I‚Äôve got a rapid hit / kill clip roll with a range masterwork. Pretty happy with it, not gonna lie.
---
Yep
---
??? I‚Äôm not arguing with you dude I‚Äôm on you‚Äôre side lol
---
ok did more looking around idk why it called s14 but it not s14 because the ep is called lost child the s14 ep 6 is called roger's baby so wtf
---
The endgame is where the game really starts. It doesn't take very long to power through the campaign.
---
don't give up, it's one of the most painful grinds i have ever done in this game and felt like quitting multiple times but the reward is definitely worth it. it may be a pvp pinnacle weapon but it shines in pve. Mountaintop is an absolute boss melter if you have lunafaction or rally barricade. with well, it's an easy 50+% damage to primeval on your own, with 2 or more guys running mountaintop you could 1 phase the primeval in prime
---
it literaly season 16 not 14 so wtf does that mean 4 season are just gone wtf
---
Crimson should be in A tier 
---
It‚Äôs reload on precision kills and health regen is really good and if you can hit the bursts well enough in crucible it kills
---
No, play it you‚Äôre fine. Endgame is easy to get. 
---
Most people will look out for your exotics in which you can get 4 exotics +1 if tou decide to get an engram. From xur which will help you level up.
---
The story can be easily rushed through though you might need to level up. 
---
If you grab forsaken now you can bump yourself up to level 30 and do the campaign and other dlcs. 
---
Get the destiny app on your phone, on this you can look for lfgs for people to help you or you help them. 
---
I can‚Äôt really list everything but the point is its fine if you‚Äôre late but in fact you‚Äôre just in time for season of opulence where there will be a power boost forsaken and/or annual pass owners. I really reccomend it but you might have to grind a bit more than other games quickly to get to ‚Äòendgame‚Äô level.
---
I‚Äôm on console and those two wreck in crucible and gambit
---
Cool story bro
