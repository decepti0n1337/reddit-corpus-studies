I love Steam names

---
---
NetEase isn't publishing anything, but did invest in Bungie to have them make a new game. The game hasn't been revealed yet but the investment was publicly announced.
---
Yep
---
Maybe before hand but they have already said this year as one season ends it sets up story for the next. So I have hope. I mean did you honest &gt;!expect to find a pyrimad on the moon? I honestly wasn't expecting those until D3.!&lt; I think if they were still with CommieVision we would have just had another Forsaken with an annual pass that was meant to push new mindless features that didn't play into the story. As it is now this all seems to be working up toward something.
---
No
---
Next revive you get phalanx shield slammed
---
I had 3 drop already this reset
---
Someone had to say it
---
Not guardians
---
Didn't get one in the entirety of year two, then last week I had 3 drop within an hour. WTF.
---
I am a console player myself, Xbox one. But if I were restricted to only console gaming then yes I would consider stadia or just wait for the new consoles to come out with better hardware. However after I was peer pressured by my PC friends into getting a pc it‚Äôs one of the best investments I‚Äôve made in terms of gaming experience. I would highly recommend getting pc over stadia. Pc does offer controller support if you get one with Bluetooth or just setup via wired connection.
---
I finally got an exotic engram and it dropped hard light :(

---
Lol if you use the selfie emote your camera does the same XD
---
I live in a constant state of fear and misery
---
Do you miss me anymore?
---
Iirc bungie doesn't care if someone does a recovery
---
Buy it. 35 dollars? No brainer
---
Hey all! So I've been trying out this game for 2 - 3 days now on Steam (F2P) and am very much liking it thus far. I have 2 questions tho: Shadowkeep or Forsaken? I know this has been answered countless times, but I keep seeing mixed answers. And my other question is where can I find detailed descriptions of certain abilities/talents/whatever you call them (ie. how much dmg boost does well give or how much extended duration do you get with everlasting fire)? Thanks!
---

---
EDIT: Is it also possible to -just- buy the Shadowkeep DLC instead of Shadowkeep + season pass?
---
Nice play oem totally saved u at the end lol
---
That voice line gave me chills every single time I watched the trailer for Shadowkeep
---
I‚Äôm not even talking about exotics. Sidearms in general need a pvp and pve buff in order to get considered about being used. Cammy is known for using more obscure load outs and I can‚Äôt remember a time where he‚Äôs ised a sidearm
---
As a Hunter main, I approve of missile Titan. Just aim at OEM wearing bottom tree striker scum
---
That‚Äôs part of it. I‚Äôm just not a fan
---
I'm gonna need sources because I'm pretty current on the lore and have never seen any mention of Rezyl being the first guardian, the first crucible celeb yeah maybe but not the first ever risen
---
I am a fairy new player . I started like 4 minths ago and never got exo engrams exept the ones i bought from xur and in the last 2 weeks i found like 3 or 4 just laying around i. Crucible and gambit
---
The Steam migration is a blessing, as well as a curse.
---
didn't quite answer my question but ok
---
Hey, if you also would like to carry one more noob I just sent you a friend request on Steam, im err0R.
---
I too would like to know which of our gutted supers is "worse" than bottom tree Crutcher?
---
Omfg wow
---
What if I just use it for knockout and frontal assault with synthoceps and don‚Äôt use the super
---
First quest is free. Gotta give youba taste of the spoops.
---
I laughed at how you flicked your camera angle when you 1st landed I could just hear the WTF is going on you were saying to yourself..
---
My favourite one I‚Äôve seen yet was ‚ÄúShax‚Äôs kum dumpster‚Äù
---
Yah most likely f2p so all the little kids are brining their toxic personality to game to talk trash but are the trash
---
Looks like Osiris has a new look for Sagira
---
WILL enjoy? Already got 150 hours on Steam so yeah I guess so.
---
Then you will be on the right side of history my friend.
---
Just wanted the catalyst for it :P
---
Riskrunner was my first exotic drop in Vanilla.
---
Chalupa steak supreme is the only way to go bruh
---
I have not, guess I‚Äôll make a random ass warlock after a few games later and report back if this solves my issue lol
---
all activity give the same % but if you have premium season pass you can unlock up to 3x faster catalyst progression
---
yep it's really good but it's way too bright
---
Swag
---
Mayhem. And use tether and fighting lion. Or warlock well / rift will 1 shot.
---
Contact support if it doesn‚Äôt show up
---
Guess higher chances those are the players from that specific area with letter H...why are they still playing games while streets are burning outside, do something useful!
---
They‚Äôre a corporatist authoritarian state. There‚Äôs barely anything communist about them
---
Sweet
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure Gambler‚Äôs Ruin came out with Forsaken though. I could be wrong
---
Always loved that gun
---
YES!!! This is so much better than mine. I have Boycott Blizzard of FreedomHongKong.
---
Wow it must suck being this much of an angry person.
---
I completely get that, and I agree with you.
---
It just makes me salty, I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs a legitimate reason, in fact I more or less said that in my previous post.
---
Russian is such a crazy written language
---
Isn‚Äôt there a melee symbol?
---
I'm on intermittently.
---
GT is same as name.
---
Wait, how did it save me? Lol
---
&gt;Part-time cowboy, Full-time dead.

Oh lol, I didn‚Äôt even see what mission you were doing. I meant that‚Äôs all that seems to come out of exotic engrams üòÇ
---
Didn't steal shit. Found on fcbk. If the creator wanted the upvotes then he should have posted it here first.
---
Definitely my new favorite.
---
Love me some 180 HCs.
---
Steam something built in to allow switch controllers on games that don‚Äôt have support, I do it all the time for stardew valley just visual indicators might be based of different console controls if that makes sense
---
Right I love to watch shitty videos of dumb shit
---
No. That is one single player's name.
---
My name ingame, for example, is Freyja (sword icon)(precision icon). Pretty gold when I generate orbs of light.

You're just going to jump on the band wagon thinking I'm upset huh lol.

Cayde wants to stay dead. He says so in his lore book and his various notes during Last Call. It's been a long, long life, and he wants to come home to Ace and his Queen.
---
Let the man rest, we owe him that much.
---
Did you switch between PC and console?
---
Naw I'm alright
---
Pretty sure that would start world war III
---
My clan has had this issue since launch. Anyone over four people in a team, it black screen and resets to ‚ÄúEvaluating‚Äù once it reaches twelve. Upvoting for visibility.
---
What are you talking about?  I responded to a post with relevant information. I'm being civil. How about you try enforcing the rules instead of telling law abiding citizens how it's done
---
IKR the guns is so effective against fallen and the hive plus with masterwork increased range it‚Äôs a GOD.
---
Yeah the ones I get from Sloane are fine and work with the new mods. I don't understand why the ones in the collection aren't the 2.0 version though, since there's absolutely no reason you'd want the old one as far as I can tell.
---
I also don't get why deprecated weapons are dropping in the wild and from Sloane (for instance I got a bunch of SMGs with none of the new slots).
---
That just means it has fully escalated, keep your guard up the thralls will spawn soon.
---
Switch charas or relog, it‚Äôll update
---
I would have rather had your luck of 1 now ...I‚Äôve gotten fucking 3 since Shadowkeep...knucklehead radar, lucky pants and *fucking tractor cannon*
---
oh so that‚Äôs why i‚Äôm still seeing these post this late in the game
---
( "should i come back to d2 copy and paste. ")
---
Yes. Destiny 2 is amazing and in the best state a destiny game hss been in. I dare say its better than D1 at this point. There are more milestones/powerful gear than many players can do in a week ( multiplied by 3.) , 6 raids, gambit prime, tons of weapons from past seasons, tons of exotic quests and much more.
---
Forsaken fixed the year 1 content drought by dumping a ton of content, and each season since did nothing but help. Its seasons brought us forges where we can craft certain weapons, dungeons with amazing exotic quests to em, the menagerie which is basically a mini raid with matchmaking, and even a quest line about the drifter and the nine 
---
Now Shadowkeep is here and with it another HUGE dump of content, the return of eris morn and the moon patrol zone which is larger than ever, 3+ new strikes, new maps ( gambit &amp; crucible. ), EVEN MORE¬† weapons and exotics, as well as more story and such taking place after the death of ( Redacted. ) and eliminating the new red threat on the moon, and discovering one of the true enemies of the traveler, the ( REDACTED) Itself. 
---
A new armor system is here that lets you BUILD your perk set instead of praying to RNG. A new telic is here to help you level, perk out and get better
---
D2¬† couldn't be in much of a better place ( besides needing some minor crucible tweaks. )
---
Also, if you quit because of ( Mida multitool, Lunas/Not forgotten, Prometheus lense, etc.) Being VICIOUSLY busted/OP,GOOD NEWS EVERYONE, they've beem generously nerfed down to reasonable instead of busted. 
---
So all in all, coming from a D1 alpha/Beta player who has stuck to this franchise like cancer to radiation, i dont think the franchise has ever been better.¬† The only minor complaint is, whilst d2s raids are great, they are a bit more soft, unlike the brutal dark raids of D1 ( Kings Fall. ). But, don't worry, we are still slaughtering oryx's family, because all of them have a bad case of not knowing their place.¬† ( ehem. Under my boot. ) 
---
As a traitor would say...
---
Come back to destiny, yesss? Or, you diee.....
---
( rating 9.5/10. )
---
Dont buy from the vendors. Their items always come with the fixed stats shown, which is not scaled and crap for anyone beyond 750. Even if you infuse them, they will have the same crappy stats. Level up your rep and try to get the item you want from the engrams (hopefully with the stats you want since its random).
---
(A copy &amp; paste for the constantly asked pinacle/ritual weapons/quests. )
---
Pinacle weapon quests DO NOT EVER GO AWAY. 
---
You can get all the pinacle quests no matter the season. 
---
YES. if you reach fabled and then lose rank finishing up the quest steps in a season, you will have that count as a completed step when you reach it. But if you don't finish the quest on the season you hit fabled, you have to hit fabled again. 
---
Mountain Top seekers, you can use a kill lobby to get the quest done. No this is not banable, but it will trigger some players. Basically you need enough people to fill a lobby. Youtube a guide. 
---
Good hand cannons for lunas howl are trust, west of sunfall seven, ikelos, service revolver. (Console)
---
Or
---
A good rounded 140/150 ( nation of beasts, kindled orchid, spare rations) for pc.
---
You can not get Not forgottens quest till you finish lunas howl's quest. 
---
ANYBODY can get to fabled. You just need either luck, a team or persistence.¬† 
---
Recluse is one of the best add clear wpns in game. 
---
If you get above 1980, and played/completed¬† 3 games in the current week, you get 120 score added on reset, and get fabled. 
---
If your quest doesn't trigger after you hit fabled, go to setting, then click change profile. Log back in, and bam. Done. 
---
If you quit a game it doesn't count. Quitting DOES NOT effect your weekly bonus so long as you COMPLETE 3 games. ( example: you disconnect from 2 games but complete 69)
---
Revokers quest ONLY counts score gained, NOT fabled. If you lose 20 games but win 3500 score worth ( what is that? 35 wins ish, without a multiplier?) in between the losses you still get it. 
---
You can cheese the heavy grenade launcher quest by getting a fire team, getting the corrupted strike in the playlist then going to the blind well. 
---
Redrix requires 5 resets on any 1 season.¬† DO THIS ON IRON BANNER WEEK, especially iron banner weekend during 3x experience, if you also play comp, you don't lose your quickplay streak on losses. 
---
Happy hunting. Stop asking these questions you beautiful blueberries. =)
---
( i edit this and add to it each time somebody mentions what i missed.¬† Feel free to let me know if i missed something )
---
You will.
---
I have never raided bc I don‚Äôt have enough friends and my clan didn‚Äôt add me back post Shadowkeep release #feelsbadman
---
start from scratch
---
That's my point. Comp shouldn't be way too easy or way too hard. Like I said in my post, a teammate who was honestly rubbish with all time kd of like 1.1, had a rank of 4800! 
---
Best example I can give is from overwatch. If you are a gold player, then believe it or not, you'll play against other gold players (for the most part). You won't get you a s s whooped by top 500 or wreck bronze players.
---
Not conclusive, but possibly. Myelin Games [Explored the lore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q1SPf2neME) a couple years ago.
---
What do you mean
---
Risk runner for president
---
Like strikes, Gambit, crucible but story missions work too
---
People who force politics on the unwilling need physical correction
---
The backblast alone from that fucking RPG is enough to clear a shrieker
---
Is there a sub for jokes of this format, revolving around usernames? If not, can we make one?
---
Thnx
---
I don't know if I would go that far but still
---
You're right and I'm wrong.
---
Try the destiny app or shrouded gaming (clan)
---
You no longer receive exotics at set points in the Red War. They are all world drops now.
---
That‚Äôs fair, like before shadowkeep I could barely solo or duo cue on matches without getting absolutely demolished but now after shadowkeep 90% of my matches are easy wins while the other 10% are absolute failure, they really do need to fix their match making systems
---
They don‚Äôt give out the exotics throughout the campaign anymore
---
dang thats a shame! I was watching some videos on them and they seem super helpful in PVE. Preciate it!
---
Haven't actually been paying much attention to the Stat rolls for stuff so far. So basically it's supposed to get an increase in stats when you infuse it?
---
Yo, what the fuck Bungie.
---
Hunters and Warlocks can jump the Hellmouth. Meanwhile, Titans are throwing hammers across it
---
My titan, who i haven't touched since i created, is 750
---
I see, so guardians didn't exist till eliksni collapsed and that's when traveler decided to make guardians
---
Thanks for the support
---
.....that loadout.....why
---
Sloane gives you the armour I just remembered
---
No but I believe the vendor items are suppose to be scaled to your level when you buy them. So if you're 950, buying one should come as 950, with stats appropriate for a 950.
---
The traveler made the guardians pretty much after our solar systems collapse to protect itself and the people. Again i could have some things wrong and i dont wanna make more assumptions, if you don‚Äôt know who My Name is Byf on youtube, i really would suggest watching his videos, he goes into the lore of many things and has recently uploaded a 4 hour video on the history of destiny
---
Apparently the gifts we were given as a humanity by the Traveler were given to them as well. The Fallen's main objective is to reobtain that power, they work like a band of pirates who's treasure cove has been looted. It is possible that they also obtained this power and possible that in the future we could see it, since Mithrax is so keen on helping guardians.
---
Nerf crucible
---
I wish I had games like yours haha. I'm not even a great player, I have like 1.4kd. Last season me and a friend went crazy, won like 25 and lost 3 to get to 2100 rank. So I'm guessing the game thinks I'm a top player now. 
---
But you have fun, maybe even try getting the legend rank while this broken mess lasts.
---
The last one I got was from the seasonal rewards. Before that I have no idea.
---
The puzzles only count for that specific raid run. Until the raid is completed or there are no longer any players in that session, it‚Äôll stick. 
---
You can join in and out of that specific raid run as long as it doesn‚Äôt end, but it won‚Äôt save like a checkpoint.
---
Well, I used the highest power level gear up until 900. Then I started infusing my higher level blues into my lower lever purples. Or if I had a piece of gear I liked a lot, I‚Äôd infuse a higher purple into it
---
It's a 3tap hand cannon that is void. I used it when 1-2 tap hand Cannon were a thing. Just do rumble or something less stressful for you.
---
Exactly, now I'm waiting for the next installment of this saga as we find out more about the darkness in the universe.
---
Agreed.
---
In terms of exotic quests?
---
Same with gear as well.
---
They invested $100m, not sure how that translates to getting a seat in the firm.
---
Use middle tree with the charged void grenade it's a guaranteed close range kill if you have contraverse hold or any grenade recharge mods it comes back super super fast
---
Thanks for the good luck!
---
I agree, but why are you posting this here
---
Think of it like this. The shadowkeep ‚Äúcampaign‚Äù is less of a campaign, but more of chapter 1 of what is yet to come. It introduced us to the beginning of a story that Bungie is going to continue through the rest of year 3
---
Pretty sure you just take less damage from that element.
---
Awareness, we must get it to every zone of reddit
---
Engrams or random drop. I do feel bad for new players having to do old exotic quest though. All that grinding all those campaigns you probably gotta do to get some quests started.
---
Make an anti burn gauntlet or something
---
cover the hammer in fuel
---
light it on fire
---
catch on fire
---
The element of the armor determines what mods can be applied to the armor. Certain mods require a certain element.
---
Not even if you thousands of thumbs
---
Lol, not yet, I was shield boy at the time and just yeeted it
---
I feel like an asshole but after using the play of the game the whole day i got it. thanks
---
Sleeper if I‚Äôm correct
---
What?  But Bungo told me Iron Banner was pinnacle PVP.
---
I used the ikelos or kindled orchid from black armory
---
To be fair, a symbol can‚Äôt really change much without becoming something entirely different, so the bonds stay pretty much the same.
---
Of course, that being said, the bonds are all boring as hell and offer nothing but stats, no aesthetic value whatsoever unless it‚Äôs a holographic on like older Crucible models and the Reverie.
---
Lets stand against the red legion LOL
---
Haha Cerebus+1. I had a crack in PVP, lots of fun. 
---
But I use Exit Strategy for primary... Not exactly non-meta of me. And standard tracking rocker launcher, haven't been too lucky with heavy rolls. PVE, I'll roll Thunderlord. Always fun.
---
Uhhhh ummmm uhhhh 
---
you start at 750
---
No, sorry, I tried to stretch it into a larger resolution but it messed with the art. This is the best I could get it
---
Fatebringer, Black Hammer (not Black Spindle/WOTW) and Gjallarhorn. My go-to loadout for D1Y1.
---
Yes. Dlc licenses don‚Äôt transfer.
---
You take less damage from that element and different armor mods are associated with different elements so in the context of this question (exempting mods) you should only focus on armor that is the same energy that the enemy you are gonna fight is using (go for arc if you are fighting fallen, void/solar for vex, solar/arc for hive, etc)
---
Element also matters because mods are restricted to elements. For example, any shotgun perks line scavenger or reserves is restricted to arc armor. The following is a very good info graphic for this stuff: https://www.niris.tv/blog/mod-affinity-guide
---
Idk what it is with me, but I got 6 in the last 2 days
---
I can certainly see the appeal. ES is not exactly meta, but is lowkey as deadly as recluse if you use it right.
---
Congrats dude!
---
Yes. If you go niris‚Äô website (google niris destiny) he has an infographic that explains how to get mods for each weapon and what the mod does.
---
They‚Äôre evolving
---
Sadly yes.
---
Couldn‚Äôt tell you about guns at this point but I definitely prefer bottom tree Dawnbreaker for my class. Good all around for damage and add wipe, and it replenishes itself for every kill you get with the Super itself. That said, it is diminishing returns but I still argue it‚Äôs better than, say, Nova Bomb or Chaos Reach.
---
Yes, all catalysts as far as I know are still obtainable, the ones from faction rallies are now obtainable by strikes/crucible, and I think that those are the only ones that were for limited time, though I may be wrong.
---
Yeah they did remove it from the redone campaign for new light players
---
Yep! Do some research on how to get the one you're after.
---
I‚Äôve found one this season and it was with the messenger
---
Congrats, now next up not forgotten
---
Did you ever find any clarity on this?
---
When you buy Shadowkeep you get Curse of Osiris and Warmind free I think you do too with forsaken not sure though
---
So stupid
---
No menagerie is part of the season
---
I‚Äôm a little annoyed that they didn‚Äôt manage to kill you. Especially that Arcstrider.
---
Shaxxs would be proud.
---
Yah according to a guy that ask support. They there are no longer gonna be campaign rewards for legacy idk why.
---
Should we tell him about the final step of the quest or no? Because judging by his overall instability, he plays solo.
---
COO and Warmind come with new light. Buying Shadowkeep does also give access to season of the undying tho
---
I‚Äôm with you. To do work with this weapon is EXHAUSTING. You have to concentrate quite a bit more than with, say, a bygones and you are constantly evaluating and changing your play style to suit the condition of the weapon. Stay back and play conservative until you get your first kill then go hyper aggressive and hunt. Trying to keep desperado active the whole time. Rinse and repeat. 
---
I ground it out last season and the only good thing about it for me is that I accidentally got recluse while finishing the comp part of the quest. 
---
I will say. If you are a skilled player, you will slay with this.  If you‚Äôre like me, you will stick to easier weapons and be chill. Good luck though. 
---
Make sure you grab every bounty before you play and iron banner + double Valor weekends will see you done in no time.
---
#JAY-GEE-WENTWORTH
---
Oh...i don't think I have even tried putting anything like anti-barrier mod on weapons other than the lunar or vex drops. And the only weapon I've upgraded has been outbreak perfected.
---
Damn it. Hopefully Bungie will change this. I have couple forge and gambit weapons I love using.
---
I think I should **avpid*( gambling with that kind of luck lol
---
How to you get in there? Ever since Y1 I‚Äôve been trying
---
New player? Returning? What was the last mission you did and when did you do it?
---
The next in warmind will be forsaken then shadowkeep, so yes.. You need to buy the dlcs to continue the story. But you can increase your light power through activities and stuffs.
---
Might be a lag issue? Also could be that you‚Äôre using a gun outside it‚Äôs intended range. Hand cannons have severe damage falloff after about 26-28 metres
---
I only bring out the super if A. multiple enemies. or B. enemy Super, I've actually yet to kill the same guy twice in a row... should I be concerned or proud?
---
The scale, the atmosphere, and just the quality of the image makes it one of my favorite moments in this whole game. Mind blown
---
r/Fireteams
---
There was a collectors edition?!
---
This is amazing Guardian
---
https://images.app.goo.gl/6Zs6p8Jt2VDQLpB87
---
Its a quest step in all(or atleast most) of the cruicible quests
---
Saw an ‚Äúimagine running ‚Äúmountaintop‚Äù ‚Äúrecluse‚Äù ‚Äúhammerhead‚Äù‚Äù lol
---
*Demolition Man* got it right, I guess
---
Woefullly underrated
---
I'm just wondering if anyone else has noticed that 2 malevolent blades that spawn then if you go back to where you get the cryptoglyph there are now I think 5 shreikers all eilte health bars. Wondering if this is for something else that we don't know about yet or something. Let me know if anyone figures anything out about that mission.
---
I did it solo and I'm 100% sure he had a full health bar.  It took 4 rounds of sword hits to finish him.
---
Fabled 1 so at the least Luna's Howl, the Recluse, and/or the Mountaintop if you have the other steps of there quests finished.
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs usually the last step for a crucible pinnacle weapon, Luna‚Äôs Howl, Mountaintop and The Recluse specifically.
---
Recluse, randy's throwing knife, lunas howl, and mountaintop all require you to be at least fabled and thats 2100 Glory it used to to be a rough climb for some but now its a cake walk because its not really comp anymore
---
80 hours played since the move to Steam. 0 exotics dropped for me. Level 25 season pass was a fucking knucklehead radar.
---
Log out and back in should fix it. Can grab trumph then. Had same issue.
---
I'm not there yet, but apparently if you queue into the crucible then back out it should activate? That's what I heard
---
I cannot figure out how to complete Into the Haul. I rwad I have to put the item in a machine, but idk where it is? I've tried both regular gambit and prime gambit
---
I don‚Äôt remember , but all I know that it isn‚Äôt the best .
---
Based on your highest possible score. Unrelated to what is equipped.
---
Vex gate or something like that.
---
Now light it on fire.
---
I believe it‚Äôs the Persuader, that you can get by turning in strike tokens to Commander Zavala.
---
You only have to have that "high stuff" in your inventory. You do not have to equip it
---
It‚Äôs based off of the highest gear in your inventory I believe. You don‚Äôt need to be wearing the gear so long as it‚Äôs not in the vault or a different character ect.
---
Try to balance everything out. warlocks need more recovery though.
---
^^^^
---
I spelt does wrong anyways Thx for the help I appreciate it
---
We also had the floss first
---
Seasonal artifact keeps going forever? I heared you can go as high as you can but will always reset when next season starts
---
Fs maybe bc I got a friend who wants to to
---
Wireless Xbox 360 controller works
---
Ight I'll msg you if we got room then
---
I love it.
---
I can't stand either mode personally and I avoid playing them unless I happen to find a group for it.
---
vex gate for the final week of the season when we go into the Black Garden to kill the Undying Mind
---
I think you should play old nightfall not ordeal? not sure but maybe quest just count only old nightfall.
---
I think anyone who doing a quest need to equip it.
---
Ahhh creating a vex portal to taco bell. Ikora is a genius.
---
My mistake, I've corrected it.
---
can you still get the sunshot from asher mir?
---
&gt; Failsafe is the best character in the game.
---
You do you, but I sincerely hope that's not the case. Failsafe is like a poor man's GLaDOS, but worse.
---
- Only my Captain can access those memories
---
- And he is like super dead!

Jesus...

Bra det ikke er bare jeg som har "Aktiver windows"
---
"I'd tap that" - Petra Venj, probably
---
So I cant find the battle pass. It's not listed in the shop. What do I get with it vs buying the dlcs solo?
---
I‚Äôm not sure because the campaign setup has changed post shadowkeep. 
---
Could be worth a try though, I think you can run the campaign from Amanda Holliday in the tower.
---
Good bot.
---
lol

I see what ya mean, and I would still say follow a chain thru til the end and then move on to next, you‚Äôll drive yourself crazy trying to keep track of all the ‚Äúlore‚Äù driven quests at once. So whichever you think you could benefit more from or find most enjoyable, whichever you‚Äôre going for, tackle Black armory, I‚Äôve been really enjoying the menagerie and tribute hall stuff so I‚Äôm mainly working on those whilst low key hitting some exotic and legendary quest % while doing moon bounties and other random stuff
---
Yes i did it yesterday. What a fun mission and what a nice gun ! Blessed with vex milk this thing is truly monster

You needed Photoshop to do this?
---
Wait it work ? I believe I tried but nothing happen.
---
I didn't "need" Photoshop, it's just the most convenient photo editor on my computer.
---
rip me never had one :(
---
Ssh, ikke si noe
---
Oh wow. I thought I was being a negative Nancy this whole time thinking I was the only one that found the dialogue to be so awful. I just tune everything out at this point.
---
Checked the world wide web a bit, seems like I was stuck in pre-shadowkeep in terms of terminology, where you could buy a max of 2 powerfuls per week, my apologies. I only remember the talks about J√∂tunn and Monarque taking 5 weeks to complete which would make sense if you are limited to a progress of 2/week
---
Sick 15-man comp recluse play! You even got the vanguard, shaxx, holliday, and hawthorne!
---
Fuck this game's rng. Just finished Crown of Sorrow raid to get some armor with good stats and when before I had been getting only armor when I had wanted weapons, now I'm getting only weapons even though I only want armor.
---
the pic is  good
---
Why? What have I missed?!?!?
---
No bother. But yeah it‚Äôs really annoying as it takes a bit of a grind doing the frame and forging it just for it not to count. Another week added in to an already 5 week grind ü•∫
---
The guns leaning shows which type they are. Kinetic or Energy
---
God I wish this gane worked for me
---
Atm if you dont have the quest from pre-Shadowkeep you can not get the mold for the black armory key, it is a know issue with no fix date yet. It has been reported on the official forms and Destiny Devs have said they are looking into it.
---
Ofcourse
---
Ill be down if your on in a couple of hours
---
You don't have to, but you can. You wont lose out on anything as far as I know (except not seeing the story of the campaigns obviously)
---
No one said duplicates were gone. Your chance at a new exotic is heavily weighted toward it not being a dupe.
---
Thats class
---
You actually can and you can use it. At least you could, they could have patched it with shadow keep. CammyCakes did a series of having it on an account that was level 20
---
Portal to take the fight to the Vex
---
Maybe not a good idea to have a portal to the vex in the tower, but hey
---
You will be missing out on a few of the really good exotics and also by not buying any of the DLCs you won't even have access to the raids included.
---
You can play the campaigns just go to Amanda Holiday she will have them for you
---
Thank you!
---
Yes, and that‚Äôs why I challenge myself to not use Insurmountable Skullfort or any of the easy exotics. I like to have some sort of uniqueness, cause even in a meta, an unknown or surprise load out can change everything. Example: Just earlier I ran some competitive running with only legendary armor and weapons. My load out? An Azimuth D Hans cannon, Agrona PR4 was it? Pulse rifle, and the Love and Death grenade launcher from the essences. Still similar in some sense to meta, but not expected. Did I do well those matches? Yes and no. But it made me work for every win that I got instead of,

It's not a surprise they care more about money than anything else, but the company has a giant statue with the values "think globally" and "every voice matters" engraved on it outside their headquarters. That they were swift to issue harsh punishment to appease China instead of handling it with more tact demonstrated their hypocrisy regarding their stated values very publicly. What could have been an apology for politicizing a gaming event with an agreement to not discuss the matter further through gaming platforms has turned into a martyrized international incident because Blizzard's fist instinct was to protect their wallets by any means necessary.
---
That's really dope

A chat room is a forum. A public chat room is still a chat room. Just like a big waste of time is still a waste of time.

I just did around 50 matches of Gambit over the last week to unlock Breakneck and Exit Strategy. I was fortunate enough to randomly get a Bug-out Bag during a Gambit Prime run I was doing for SMG Multi-kills.
---
I can confidently say that I don't enjoy Gambit.
---
dude you live under a stone? in the bottom of the sea?

They aren't false statements. What do ordinary people gain from making false statements about another country? We aren't world leaders playing a power game, or businesses looking to gain some economic edge. We're regular people saying what we see, and what we see is a systematic contempt for human life and dignity, and a sustained assault on civilisation and peace, all perpetrated by the chinese government. I'm sorry, but you really are brainwashed. I pity you.
---
The whole state ent on stream has Gotten worse tho, the au team, did something similar but with a sign, yet they received no penalty, and have now pulled themselves from the tournament, believing that they deserve to be penalized.
---
Hmm.. there‚Äôs not really an easy way to tell in all honesty. Maybe a few hours if you match into some good lobbies, or if you get a super good winstreak. I mean hell, maybe it‚Äôll only take you an hour, or it could take you a few days, its hard to predict.
---
No, it's a pineapple :)
---
We fucking gamblers dodged a fucking nuke
---
Dodge the $35 belt
---
Wait, people dont like gambit??
---
Thanks. Glad its not nothing.
---
Ah my favourite pastime of a pseudo intellectual.  Let's draw basic parallels because we so observant, and after finding one, pretend the only picture you can draw with that single identical line is the devil.
---
They have made it so much easier this season! My friend is new to the game too and we both got to fabled in about 3 hours of gameplay. If your on Xbox we'd be happy to help
---
Is it easier to do it with a team? Or do you get matched with other teams if you play with a team?
---
Oh
---
Ahh a man of culture I see
---
Imagine this was a battlenet name before the account transfer
---
I play on pc but have an Xbox. Does destiny support mouse and keyboard? I'm trash with a controller lol
---
Most 140s I have found still pretty good, but 150s are definitely better on Crucible for most situations. 110s are still pretty average, but I find them fun to use.
---
If you are going for fabled and have never played you would be better off LFGing a fireteam to go in.  My second match this season I was up against someone ranked heroic and another ranked fabled on the opposite team.  If you have a fireteam you can communicate with it makes it much easier.
---
Now we face a new giant pyramid on the moon...
---
now you're just putting words in my mouth and getting offended over nothing.
---
I already made my stance clear I find what blizzard distasteful and I'm very active in the politics of my state and country (I'm a Libertarian if that means anything) but I also believe in logic and reasoning over emotions a well reasoned sound strategy for the future beats fiery responses on the internet.
---
So please if you really want to help them I can link to you donation pages and you can take first aid Training and volunteer I can't because I have a family to look out for but use your passion don't waste it here. :)
---
He was banned for making a statement that would 'bring you into public disrepute'. There isn't an argument in response to whether he broke the rule or not, because he did. Blizzard have a right to ban him. The issue is that given the current climate, the context etc, blizzard could have ignored, disregarded, or generally handled it differently.
---
I am entirely in support of this movement and entirely agree blizzard have handled this poorly (especially regarding the dismissal of two casters that quite literally, did nothing), but he did break the rules in place.
---
exactly but most seem to treat it as such.
---
I love that part in the first movie (aka the only good one) when Sil kills that bikie by forcing her tongue all the way through his head via the mouth.
---
It's a hypothetical situation dingus
---
People are insulated, the biggest issue with our global world where news travels in seconds is how do you actually shield yourself from all the absolutely awful, horrible, depressing, soul crushing bullshit that happens every day in every country. I love people being aware but it's a tricky balancing act, we all know someone who means well but spends all their time pushing whatever agenda they think would help the world and in the end just puts people off their cause. People tend to stick to what they know and get passionate about that, if that's politics cool but sometimes it's games or football or whatever.
---
if they where to bring the old d1 taken king ironbanner armor I would wear that shit to the end of days

Couchiebomber is the tag. I‚Äôm not great but have my moments

Yea, last year I believe. It was something like 100 million to make games for China.

The only major thing we can comain about is Zavala spitting in the face of OSHA regulations

same problem here. Wasted a lot of synth before I found out this was a bug and its not rng lol

Yeah that was me.

Easy....turn on pc/xbox/ps4....download game.....play.
---
Hey bro, thanks for taking the time to answer all of my questions! So awesome! This is certainly gonna help me out :)
---
Thank
---
Really difficult Chief
---
I know you love China, based on your other comments, but taking money from a company infamous for human rights violations isn‚Äôt irrelevant.
---
I‚Äôm saying that as a massive Bungie and Destiny fan,
---
yea i bet bungie was like hey these protests in hk will keep escalating more and more and after this esports game this one kid who won is going to say something to make china mad so blizzard will simply do what they have the right to as written in their agreement with the players in the matches and then the majority of the gaming community will come together in a complete solidarity pretty much never seen before in the gaming community and not let it die and then blizzard‚Äôs image will pretty much be irreparable. yea we should part ways with blizzard because of THAT ok agreed cool
---
I honestly hated the samurai look in y1&amp;2, I avidly played IB in D1, but i didn't feel like the rewards were cosmetically worthwhile before. I cant find the new tweet that shows the new armor
---
Oof, my only 2 exotics have been dupes.
---
Revoker may not be ‚Äúbad‚Äù in PvE in the most literal sense, but there‚Äôs no point in using something a lot more PvE friendly/oriented.  Revoker was made from the ground up for PvP and has little to no utility outside of PvP. 
---
You could argue and say that the other crucible pinnacle weapons are absolutely amazing in both PvP and PvE (Mountaintop and Recluse) but the functionality of those weapons are completely different.  You can tell that Bungie took a different approach with Revoker than they did with Recluse and Mountaintop.
---
They have a seat on the board and a minor stake in the company, it's definitely not nothing. I haven't seen any cases of NetEase censoring anything China related outside if China so i'm fine with it as long as their is no censorship.
---
I'm new and haven't tested it out yet but I did see someone named 'FreeHK' yesterday so I don't think they are censoring anything. 
---
I do wonder what would happen if you were to type 'Tiananmen Squade' or 'Winnie the Pooh' in local chat though.
---
ahhh i figured it was something like that, like, 3 meta weapons
---
are you asking it as how easy would it be to catch up? if so then very easy. i havent done hardly anything related to shadowkeep or forsaken and im 915 light. obviously thats not huge but not terrible considering i barely get to play. just play story then strikes and crucible and once high enough light do anything that offers powerful gear
---
Same
---
Whatever dude. Everyone takes cash from the Chinese.
---
Wonder if that played a role behind closed doors. I'm sure the ps exclusive game mode for modern warfare was thought of shortly after they decided on a name. Bungie road the coat tails for the perfect amount of time and could have made a back out deal that made it look like Activision was leaving cause Bungie could have more dirt on Activision. Perhaps if the exclusive game mode was taken Alot better I'm sure maps weapons etc were to follow along with expensive DLCs that really only make it feel like a full game right as the player base dies forever and hackers take over. I think Bungie and destiny have no where to go but up and potentialy be the wow of fps
---
LOL I read that in his voice.
---
\^ This, I was hoping I could get gensym knight and EP as ornaments
---
Dodged an entire flood invasion
---
Check your collections.  If you have the ornaments you can reacquire them and use them.
---
Suicides dont affect K/D ratio
---
You can wait until the items are available for bright dust.
---
because bungie is lazy and is lacking on the industry standard
---
You might have to forge it with a black armory weapon equipped.
---
Dont wory, i will
---
ah thanks.
---
It‚Äôs all cosmetic. And completely optional, and most of it will be sold for bright dust eventually.
---
yeah all i need are 2 resets for the ghost and i cannot motivate myself enough to go in the playlist.  i love pvp but the invasion system just seems so wonky that it kinda makes it unenjoyable so id rather spend my time elsewhere to be honest.
---
Haha for now. Your game still womps
---
Sorry it wasn‚Äôt bungie who tweeted it but this was the [armor ](https://twitter.com/josephbiwald/status/1182429443500859392?s=21)
---
I didnt know they'd be available for bright dust at some point, but even if it's cosmetic only, are 4 armor cosmetic sets really worth the price of a full game?
---
You entitled little shit.
---
I'm proud of your actions as well, so it cancels the disgust. Haha.
---
"What is a miracle, Vincent?"
---
Happy to help
---
‚Äúwrong tree, nerd‚Äù always feels good when you nova bomb a nova warp
---
I can see the devs looking at the Blizzard and Activision protests, boycotts, and hate on the internet and just them smiling in their chairs.
---
I have them but it kills my stats to use them
---
Dude there‚Äôs like tons of exotics I don‚Äôt have for warlock and I still get duped almost every time
---
A bit newer to rainmaker, but how would I go about configuring the icons to be different applications/icons?
---
Yea I got recluse in 3 hours it was amazing how good freelance is
---
Oh, you guys know each other? Thanks for asking for me tho :)
---
Ahem xur
---
Cosmetics is what makes Fortnite money, I think Bungie wanted to try to get a piece of the pie, but the player's here would rather pay for the game and get the cosmetics for free.
---
Then don‚Äôt pay. Like I said it‚Äôs completely optional. The eververse store has aloud bungie to creat some great things in the game in the past so I‚Äôm totally ok with prices. But yeah, most of it will be available for bright dust. And if you don‚Äôt finish the armor set you get a discount on the price if you own some of the armor.
---
You‚Äôre late to the party here. Who‚Äôs you comment aimed at?
---
I used to look up at the moon and imagine seeing a small black dot slowly moving across the moons surface. I would imagine it's some big creature making it's way across the moon. Sometimes the black dot would stop moving. That's how I knew it was looking at the earth - I thought "it can probably see me right now."
---
I use it pretty often in Gambit.
---
Whisper was nerfed, but it is probably back to being the best heavy after the auto-reload removal from rallicade/luna rifts. For legendary power weapons, g.launchers is where it is at for boss dps, MG's also got a huge nerf to boss damage, but are still good for add clearing.
---
I don't blame you. The good news is that the drifter bounties count towards rank. So you could do the PvE non-gambit bounties, and then play Gambit when there's double/triple infamy. Makes it slightly more bearable.
---
Damn that‚Äôs pretty cool. I don‚Äôt like to invade on gambit because I feel like I let my team down if I only get one kill or no kill at all. However if I‚Äôm lucky I can just throw the thousand blades and get multikills when they are all focused on the primeval.
---
Guaranteed you own at least one item (likely many more than one) that was made in China. Therefore, you are directly supporting China.
---
Look at your weapons mod slot and your armor mod slots.  That is where new mods go, not the mod inventory page in inventories.
---
You didn't predict that would happen??
---
And then the thundercrashing Titan
---
they're directly linked by netease are you daft?
---
That‚Äôs indirectly you moron
---
I always hit up xur homeboys got my back I just dislike how people whin when the world drop engram is a dupe I've never seen a world drop
---
First 2 encounters highly recommend mountaintop and recluse. Breezed through those in like 15 mins like it was nothing. For the 3rd encounter I highly recommend izanagis with catalyst, 21 delirium, and maybe recluse.
---
4th encounter idk haven‚Äôt gotten to it yet
---
Yeah ive checked theyre not thier. I also recieved a mod called one two finisher from the phogoth nightmare hunt at the end and i can find it anywhere
---
It's correct that the Wikipedia article states that, I can however not find any mention of that in the source Wikipedia cites for that. In addition to that, Wikipedia claims that Netease received a "minority stake" in Bungie as well as a seat in the board of directors, something that is literally impossible, as Bungie is a privately owned company that does not have stocks or a board of directors.
---
This does not work.
---
So its perk is, having the ability to be equipped with other exotic pieces? It's kind of pointless. I would give it something unique cause with that, it really is just a legendary armor piece. 
---
Maybe, if there were exotic marks for titans and other classes, I would treat them specialy. Like, having a unique set of 2 colums of perks, but you have to choose them, in that case, having that particular perk about having it equipable with other exotics could really be useful.
---
Think they were more preparing against Overwatch2 as it might be a competitor.
---
We already have team scorched so have something like that but with vex lazers
---
HK's fight for their freedom is a big deal, a few hundred thousand gamers in the US not playing HS for a few weeks is not.  This is Reddit bruh, they'll be outraged by something else in a week and back to playing Blizzard games.  How long did the EA boycott last?
---
It‚Äôs the cost of free to play, they spend millions on development and give the game away, the store is a way to produce more income to develop future content. As others have said it‚Äôs cosmetic and has no effect on the game play, completely optional.
---
Shaxx would be proud
---
Perfect, thankya!
---
I wasn't too *too* interested until I learned I could transfer saves. Now I'm hype to play again honestly.
---
Also i would like if gambit had more interesting gamemodes, might actually be enjoyable then
---
Oh my god this is genius thank you. Those are 5 minute matches!
---
You are talented! This is sick.
---
well yes,,,but actually no
---
I second this. For heroic public events too!

Funny enough, no! :)
---
Just saying, that risk runner is the only reason I got a 100k run in the nightfall last night. Its soooooooo good for this weeks nightfall. Damn near everything has arc shields and shoots arc.

4 rounds of scorched this week is quick and easy. And you can complete your weeklies really fast.

I've played 10 games and am at Heroic II with a 3 game win streak. I'm seriously considering going for Legend this season.

Do you know how to strafe? Jotunn is very avoidable. If you can't strafe, well... you're going to die to Jotunn alot. I love watching people just stand there and take it. Kind of funny really because it can be avoided by strafing.

Obviously I know what's going on with Blizz and Act, but what was Bungo doing that's no longer a big deal? Microtransactions? Or what?

The best decision ever made, they revived the game and made it fun in one blow, who knew all they had to do was leave Activision-Blizzard other than everybody.
---
[removed]
---
I‚Äôll use this advice for myself as well lol
---
You can't get bright engrams, they've explained this. They are self publishing, look up the costs and figure out for yourself just how much a game like destiny really costs, it's a necessary evil. If you don't want to pay: just don't.
---
You‚Äôre getting mixed answers because they changed it with shadowkeep/new light launch. Previously you had to do powerful frames at any forge and you got a random chance at dropping it. Now it‚Äôs a quest. The frames it asks you to complete are only the powerful ones, meaning the first of a certain type that you do that week that you purchase with ballistics logs. 
---
Ex: you do a pulse rifle frame, it counts, you do another one, it won‚Äôt, you do a handcannon frame, it counts, and that‚Äôs the limit for your frames this week. Wait until reset next week to progress further
---
This should be at the top. Came here from r/all.
---
I've been out of the game for a long time so, I didn't know that. I've got to give that a go.
---
I disagree with your Banshee statement. He's quite literally the most important NPC at the tower now. You get everything for upgrading to masterwork gear from him. It's not cheap either.
---
There are no new supers associated with shadowkeep. All new supers were associated with Forsaken and I believe are now just open to everyone at start. You don't get a season pass, you only get the season of undying with shadowkeep (and the battle pass for this current season) as where Forsaken get's you all 3 of last years season's content (Raids, Gambit Prime, Menagerie, and a lot of exotics). Almost none of the Forsaken content is free. You can buy the Season of Undying as a standalone for $10 and get the battlepass that goes with the season.   
---
I like where D2 is at currently and I bought the Deluxe version of ShadowKeep basically pre paying for the next 3 seasons, but Shadowkeep alone isn't really worth it. The Moon story is cool and I'm not upset with the mindset that I paid $25 for ShadowKeep and $10 for Season of Undying, but the mindset of ShadowKeep cost $35 is what puts a lot of people off because ShadowKeep doesn't come with much. Yes you're locked out of a lot of power engram rewards without it, but since you won't own ShadowKeep you won't have the new raid so that doesn't matter too much.
---
By default if you plug a controller into your computer, aim assist will be active. I‚Äôm pretty sure you can disable it in settings if you want
---
But eyes up
---
Should I finish EZD first though? I haven't finished the missions there, and I dunno how long that is
---
Its a type of stupid fun
---
Why?
---
did you check if it is locked to a specific element?
---
You are correct. I guess most U.S issues that I‚Äôm considering with my statement aren‚Äôt on the same spectrum of importance as what they are going through.
---
I'd offer the advice to just run with what you get until you get to 900 power level. You'll be getting new gear CONSTANTLY until you reach that 900 cap so upgrading stuff is kinda wasteful of those precious upgrade modules. You'll want to wait until you're 900 power level and have found a set of armor you both like the perks of and think look cool. After that point you'll be relying on powerful drops (you only get through completing longer term tasks throughout the week), and you can upgrade the stuff you like and/or replace it with the powerful drops as you grow towards 950. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I'd also offer, that you can infuse a purple with a blue to raise the light level. Any rarity (color) can raise any rarity. Again, though, don't worry about infusing your armor until you're 900+, if you find a gun you really like I can understand that, but constantly upgrading your armor is expensive and progress prohibitive. By that same token, make sure you're always using your best rated gear because drops are based on currently light level. If you keep dragging around a low-light level weapon because you like it, it will slow your progress to 950 significantly. 
---
Hope something in there helped! Eyes up. Godspeed.
---
He isn‚Äôt the only guardian. Praedyth too.
---
He is neither dead nor alive I think because his fall through time hasn‚Äôt happened yet but it‚Äôs also happening or something like that, super confusing.
---
Coming back from a break - all the sudden I'm 750!   
---
My question is - did they buff any of the content to accommodate for every character starting so high? I only have the base game, but plan on purchasing the expansions, so did they leave Leviathan at 300? If so, little bit of a bummer that there's only 1 raid above my light level - would really like to be able to go through each raid, but won't be nearly as much fun if a group of 750+ just steamroll it.  
---
Jumping back in is overwhelming, but I'm finding my feet and I'm excited to get back into it!
---
But at the same time why bother getting the loot if you aren't going to earn it. The whole point of the game is to play it and earn better and better loot and the season pass is just one method of that. It's never going to be perfect for everyone and most MMO's and loot based games aren't ideal for people with busy schedules but i feel destiny is much more accessible for the casual audience than most other games ive played. It's a difficult balancing act managing content between your casual audience that doesn't play every day and the hardcore players that milk the highest of content. And this season pass is easily the most doable of ones ive seen. If you play for an hour a day you can easily get 1-2 levels a day and get most of the rewards from the season pass, especially since most of the good rewards are fairly early on.

do they have concentration camps yet?

---
Blizz/Activision are honoring requests from the Chinese government which obviously seems super scummy.
---
Very salty, it‚Äôs almost as if I can only use weapons approved by every PvP player?? 
---
And there‚Äôs me thinking if it‚Äôs available, I can use it? 
---
Damn I got it wrong
---
Yup!
---
Is it available to use? If yes then I guess that means *anyone can use it* Ir did I misunderstand?
---
you just sound mad. this game isn't counter strike. bomb plant objectives with revives, supers, 1 shot abilities, limited ammo on special/heavy make it near impossible to make countdown a truly competitive mode. if you took away the bullshit and made it solely a gun game it would make sense. but there's too many wild cards at play and that makes the game mode a joke.
---
I remember someone in another thread saying contracts where they can rescind your compensation on a whim are unenforceable, and any attorney could easily get the money back, but I don't know enough about law as to whether that's true or not.

They said it was like having your roof replaced, claiming you didn't like it and then refusing to pay for it.

All Red War exotics are from world drops now

Mouse and keyboard don't have recoil. That's why I asked if controller on PC does or not. I'd be very salty if PC players didn't have recoil using controllers. I think mouse and keyboard should have it too.

Take you blue engram and get out.
---
Alrighty will do! I'll DL now and check it out. Thanks!

I mean, are there even enough bounties to reset in a season to have that be viable?  Either way, that's a lotta bounties to get done.
---
Deleted and restarted my Hunter last night (was my kid's character on PS4, now we're both on PC on our own accounts, and he was ugly AF.)
---
You aren't kidding. Outside of basic mechanics new player experience is confusing as hell.
---
Yes, YES!
---
Ok, but it‚Äôs not an exotic it‚Äôs a legendary
---
I least that one only requires kills and not any sort of rank or win streak.

---
What‚Äôs the resolution on it? Would love to make this my background
---
People act like signing an EULA gives companies the right to do whatever the fuck they want but that's not how it goes.
---
*AYYAYAYAYYYYY*
---
You could use it with sunbracers since melee ability kills give infinite grenade energy and with enough strength you get melee back in no time with Monte. The contraverse/top tree void sounds better to me though as charging the grenades makes them do more damage
---
*Poses*
---
Yes, I dont get the option portion.
---
Please come save my wallet!
---
I'm not paying for any of this, but I would if it was reasonably priced, which it isnt.
---
It being optional has nothing to do with the price
---
Oh true...
---
Uhm i have no idea then.
---
Sorry been replying to posts like this a lot lately, without really thinking much.
---
LOL I reset once last season and even that was hard to get through.
---
Imma be honest, I didn‚Äôt realize activision and blizzard were together. I mean it even said it in the meme and I still didn‚Äôt make the connection
---
I'm sure they did, but that doesn't make it right. 
---
There is no moral equivalency between protestors demanding democracy and personal safety, and a government known for genocide and death camps and disappearing dissidents.
---
Once you download it. The campaigns can be found in the tower at a vendor called the shipwright aka Amanda Holliday. Alot of folks have trouble finding the campaigns once they start the free to play version. She's to the far right in the tower all by herself.
---
Seems dumb but thanks for telling me
---
#Ding
---
Wait...
---
I saw 2 posts saying it would be impossible to hit 960 because of the way pinnacles drop. How have you already hit 962 on all 3?
---
Few things in life are as satisfying as dunking on striker titans.  Mmmmm.  Schadenfreude.
---
Looks great !
---
So basically, this is how I do my "Story campaigns" for the base version of the game?
---
Oh wow thanks man for the reply. I'm currently at 903 and luckily I holded off from redeeming the bungie reward which iirc gets you free powerful engram. I think Im gonna focus on finishing the second level of leviathan raid for now (never done it before) .
---
also, the objective in survival is to generate a life lead and win as a result. heavy/super is your comeback mechanic aside from mechanical skill. you'll be alright champ.
---
Now he can play the game
---
OW is one of my favorite games. 
---
Shame I won't be buying the sequel. I was looking forward to the rumored campaign mode.
---
I don't use meta weapons in PvP and kill people with recluse and mountaintop all the time.
---
Bungie isn't a bunch of bitches. Thats why. I'll always love them. They started out as Mac developers and one of my first FPS games I loved was made by them (Marathon)
---
Gear is 950. +12 because of the artifact.
---
Only pinnacle drops take u from 950 to 960 gear score wise. I hvn't done any.
---
Yes we do every 5 levels you get an engram after tier 100
---
But. Have you completed  Erianas vow catalyst
---
if you already have all the forsaken exotics, yeah their gonna be dupes.
---
but you don‚Äôt get monte carlo from xur
---
You won't get the season pass items handed to you but, it does allow you to go out and grind for it and it puts it into your loot pool.  
---
edit: you will only get the items that were included in the deluxe edition right away, which was the cayde stash.
---
If you already have all of the exotics that the fated engram can become, he‚Äôll give you a duplicate. Otherwise it is guaranteed to be new to your collection.
---
Thanks! Gonna order one soon.
---
That's why I don't play much PvP. That, and I'm not very good at it.
---
Holy shit are you actually getting killed by jotunn? Hahaha. That thing is a meme gun outside of PvE, do you stand still while shooting or something?
---
LMAO
---
Start with all the planetary vender bounties and banshee-44 bounties. Those can be done the fastest. Plus you be getting xp while your doing the tasks as well
---
i lost connection from the match and then posted it
---
 Np have fun.
---
I'm level 25 right now and I've basically only played on my titan. so with another 60 days to go I can't imagine not getting the remaining 75 levels in that timeframe.
---
I love how i found the no skill players all downvoting me cause y'all dont actually have a rebuttle for those op weapons. Keep your delusions yall
---
If you made it heroic without killing the hydras, I have no idea. I‚Äôve been killing them and getting it to spawn. Maybe it‚Äôs all the harpies? Maybe you have to kill the gate lord and a certain number of enemies before the escape timer starts? I don‚Äôt know.
---
Ahh thx for the links sir!
---
Appreciate that
---
I do believe this is a known bug.
---
Unsure of what the in-game item is as of now. I‚Äôll update the post once I learn what it is.
---
For the record, i dont even use telesto in crucible cause its to op. Get you a weapon that doesnt make you good only cause of unbalanced perks
---
Did my in progress quests reset? I was in the middle of the Osiris DLC before the update and now it seems I have to start over? Or am I missing something?
---
It literally fking says
---
Awards items that player does not currently have
---
#IF ANY REMAIN TO BE EARNED
---
I started playing for the first time when new light was released, still haven‚Äôt seen an exotic engram. It‚Äôs been 85 hours played now
---
[deleted]
---
If you‚Äôre living in a hole the past few weeks perhaps this is the way to frame it. 
---
But if you‚Äôve been paying attention to NBA, and the Hearthstone issues then you‚Äôd be more than inclined to be concerned. The NBA in China literally lost all of its company sponsors and state tv air time in China over a tweet.
---
Xur doesn't give Monte Carlo? But isn't this gun attainable through a random world drop? Just checking before I waste any shards.
---
Im actuslly doing well in the crucible without using bitch weapons. And i carry most comp teams. But yeah. The guy that doesnt need op weapons is 'useless' lol
---
okay im noob where do I even get this Quest? Shaxx?
---
Okay, well I did that quest and actual got the key mold at least. I just got the 24 watchers lens, next is 200 Glimmering amethyst? Then running Bergusia tempered, a Rare black armory Bounty, and supposedly the shattered throne completion. Or so says the old guide.
---
Good thing netease only has a minority stake in bungie and a single seat on the board.
---
xurs engrams don‚Äôt give shadow keep exotics
---
I‚Äôm just trying to get a Monte Carlo.
---
Muslims in camps? tell the terrorist groups so they leave europe and go there instead
---
Hey, while everything going on with Blizzvision is definitely disgusting, we would like to keep politics outside of our gaming subreddit to maintain it as a place solely for discussion and shitposting about our favorite game. A good deal of people want to come to the sub to relax and joke around about unhaunting the moon, and bringing politics in--even for the best of reasons--upsets that vibe. 
---
We did miss this post, so we'll leave it up, but in the future, please avoid any political posts. If you'd like to discuss the happenings in Hong Kong or Blizzard, please bring your thoughts to the respective subs.
---
Thank you for your understanding.
---
Can confirm. (Sauce; am girl. Thinks Mara is hawt.)
---
Ohh... 
---
That being the case, does Monte Carlo have a chance to drop anywhere because I own Shadowkeep, or do I need to be in a Shadowkeep area like the moon?
---
Where is he located this week?
---
Has a kid, had to focus on them :(
---
Nah im looking for hive ones. I heard from some acolytes that savath√ªn is hot under the dress üò¶
---
I'm at 4/10 right now for both.
---
no, it drops anywhere if you have shadow keep
---
Ah got ya, yeah more types of exotics, and more type of guns overall, 90% of pve atm is Izanagi, recluse and an random powerweapon. you dont really need anything else, which is quite sad. I want special perks from raids, or pvp, that only roll on thier specific weapons. Whats the handcannon from VoG again? lightsomething, it had a exotic variant with Elemental damage. More stuff like that would be cool
---
If you read the engrams it tells you it contains year 2 exotics and that's it
---
Muslims terrorists attack Southeast Asia all the time, unfortunately American news doesn't really cover it. I think in China itself there's probably fewer attacks since all the Muslims are in camps and I'm sure the government would cover it up if there are... although it does seem surprising China is not more of a target, now that you have me thinking about it. Huh.
---
In any case I don't *think* most Islamist terrorism happens in Europe by a pretty big margin, I don't have time to find proof of that atm though.
---
Lol on the I don‚Äôt even know what the campaign is comment. Definitely had that experience.  There‚Äôs probably some npc you need to talk to. 
---
I actually kinda hope no serious competitive meta develops.  It‚Äôs a ton of fun as it is and has a lot of variety in strategy and weapons.  Once some elite team comes in and defines a meta that‚Äôs all anyone wants to do.  I dunno, maybe it‚Äôd be alright.
---
Uhm I want I mean my friend wants shaxx naked with her.
---
I read somewhere that engram drops are based on number of enemies killed. So if you were trying for a random drop then Vex Offensive does offer a lot of things to shoot.
---
420 bright dust... nice.

She know the way of succ

Nice

Yes and I believe I dont have it all earned

What movie is this from?

---
Are all mods available on 2.0?
---
Afaik the heavy kills to super one wasn't available..
---
People are only downvoting you because of the way you presented it.
---
Ultimately you‚Äôre correct.
---
Yeah that sounds great I really appreciate it.  What's your clans name?
---
No way I have all earned though
---
Its a pursuit from Shaxx, but you don't need to "get" it to complete it, since its only requirement is to get the triumph
---
Saladin's Vigil for LIFE
---
engram drops are based on RNG.  The number of enemies killed theory is hokum.
---
You have to have the weapon afaik.
---
Don‚Äôt worry about the raid man, just grind to 950 power along with getting good weapons in each slot like Recluse and a well rolled Hammerhead, then once you‚Äôve done that it should be relatively easy to just find a group and do the raid.
---
They need to nerf Titans in general, the one hit dash shit is ridiculous they have mods to automatically gain that shit back once its said and done. Lol
---
Oh I‚Äôm on level 7 lol
---
YouTube the ascendant challenge for harbingers seclude. Several easy to follow guides. 
---
Also it‚Äôs full curse week so if you do the blind well bounty from Petra. You will be rewarded an offering to the oracle. 
---
Make the offer and go to the queens court. There is bone lore in there as well.
---
You can put anti barrier and overload rounds on recluse.
---
Annnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnd I've got a new desktop.  
---
Thanks.
---
They have a lot of armor available in the world. Rahool has engrams you can buy also. Grinding is part of the fun dude.
---
Thanks didn't know
---
because it's true
---
The helmet stayed on
---
This looks amazing this would be be my permanent Titan mark
---
You ever get to drop? I still haven't myself and I've done nightmares, patrols, events, chests on the moon for hours on end
---
This guy obviously doesn't play destiny
---
That doesn't work after fabled.
---
Thanks for the suggestion. Hopefully it proves successful!
---
I got the same doing that mission too...  
---
Take a guess what it was....  
---
A F\*\*\*\*\*G Riskrunner, 2 in one mission
---
Rip when "beautiful world building" is simply just console exclusive content
---
My apologies.
---
Nope
---
I agree. But I don't like blind grinding if that makes sense. I want to be able to work toward something specific. And it looks like I can't even preview vendor tables anymore... Which is how I got that set to begin with.
---
So its pretty much impossible now?
---
Pretty sure you can start any of the campaigns in any order you want at the chick in the city hanger (far left on the map). You don't need to have previous campaigns completed.
---
As far as I know there is no reason to do Red War unless you really want the season pass xp from the missions. There is a guaranteed random exotic drop at the end of it, although some people wrote that its bugged and they did not get anything ever since the bungie-activision split.
---
Your opinion is bad and you should feel bad!
---
It‚Äôs not console exclusive.
---
This is great to hear! Thank you.
---
Only thing I dislike about it is the chest piece. They tried the ranger look but it doesn‚Äôt click with me. Some of the d1 design stuff was nice
---
same, I use it now. CRUSHES. What do you mean modular though&gt;?
---
Yeah as it was way too strong when it were a thing.
---
why you die but no kill
---
Just killing noobs that are barely moving or responding....
---
Go to a vanilla planet,open chests and do patrols/public evemts. You'll get armor eventually.

Kight:"Well that was disappointing."
---
‚Äªhops away.
---
The most Titan thing to ever be done.
---
I think the problem is that having to give up a slot for a shotgun so you can stop titans  from insta killing you is less fun than just using what you think is fun and not having to be worried every that at every corner you‚Äôll die with no warning
---
I read this in a Shaxx voice and that was not a mistake, I don't think.
---
Can f2p players buy stuff from Xur?
---
oooookayyy i got it
---
It is honestly the last thing I would call for a nerf in ranked pvp play right now. Against a good team, one would be lucky connecting with it once per game.
---
Once all drones are shot, a black armory box spawns near the forge when you complete it at the end and you open it
---
I hope to one day be half as glorious as Lord Shaxx
---
I discovered that the hitbox of the jumpship is actually there since my bullets reflect on it :/
---
No fun allowed! Get out!
---
Hunter for auto reload
---
Ya, too bad the legendary drop rate is like 1 in 500 for open world stuff. Kinda hard to stomach when I can get 3-5 legendaries doing a quick Vex encounter event thing on the moon in less than 20 minutes.
---
Looks like he has a Sony Walkman on. Lol.
---
I like the old vanilla D2 stuff, and yeah some of the D1 stuff was cool.
---
One of the ornament sets is quite good, cant remember the name. Makes you look a but like Han Solo.
---
Yes but I'm not getting a key when I open the box.
---
"You're getting stronger as you fight! I love it!"
---
CoS and GoS? Wat dat?
---
Good luck
---
...where is it???
---
Your light will only ever really matter when facing enemies that are greater or much greater in light than you.  If you're 900 and try a 920 challenge, that will be difficult.  If you try a 950 challenge, that will be substantially more difficult.  If you tried an 830 challenge, it would be no different for you than if you were at 830.
---
Bye!! Have fun on choking your last breaths as your planet heats up!!
---
On the IO map. It‚Äôs a brand new strike added when shadowkeep launched.
---
Because it's easier to kill people in their super now, a lot of people now team fire on someone charging in with a super, that's why the sudden movement in top tree teleport is so helpful now. I've been killed out of my super so many times this season lol. Had to adopt a different strategy.
---
Anymore
---
get this borderlands shit outta here.
---
Did you already get the key for the specific forge?
---
Yes but you‚Äôll have to deal with running on everything on low and the game being a horrible pixelated mess
---
30 FPS on console
---
Sure sounds like you‚Äôre complaining about those who use it but, you say you‚Äôre not then your post is very puzzling
---
Ding dong ur wrong
---
It was never console exclusive. This is a brand new strike. That was added when shadowkeep came out.
---
D:
---
You just had really good tracking on head shots, and they just sucked really..... really bad.
---
it isn't too late. I switched to PC from ps4 and it was well worth it. Cross save made it so easy :)
---
You only saw one video where the Op faced a bunch of people that didn't really know how to handle this.  This was only one video.  Out of hundreds of games.
---
That doesn't explain why everyone runs from me, I play everyday and it's always the same ‚òπÔ∏è
---
Unfortunately I missed it but yeah
---
My dad had to be taken to the hospital for a possible stroke when I got Monte Carlo.
---
Thanks dad.
---
(He's fine btw, and it was just stress)
---
No today is the edz forge which I havent done yet and I only have the key from the nessus forge.
---
Used to be random drop, after so many complaints it became a quest
---
ah i see. how do i know what content is appropriate for my light level?
---
Ok, so I stopped playing about 1/4 of the way through forsaken when it originally came out, due to IRL...
---
Anyways... I'm jumping back in now, but can't find out how to restart the forsaken campaign... It didn't save my quests for it???
---
HALP pls
---
I believe so if you have legendary shards? Try it
---
To add to that, in case this helps OP... Here's a pic of the box in the  [Bergusia forge](https://d1lss44hh2trtw.cloudfront.net/assets/editorial/2019/01/destiny-2-mysterious-box-quest-black-armory-key.jpg), and here it is in the [Volundr forge](https://i.imgur.com/UnyOHVn.jpg)
---
Don't make me come over there and jump into an abyss!
---
D2 trials armor eeeewwww bllleeeeggghhhh.... but d1 trials armor... sexy
---
Do it
---
Maannn I wanted to see the Season Pass bar fill up O\_O
---
Well, once you get to LL900 you'll see a bunch of golden circles in the Director.  Tackle those activities for better gear and a challenge.
---
Still never got the original Ghalahorn or Vex Mythocast. So there's that. I remember the LFG asking for Ghalahorns only. Like really. It also happened with 1000 voices and whisper missions. Look at the groups asking for this many dont have the items themself just want those that have it to carry them through.
---
Bring back both.
---
But he got one üòÇüòÇ I didn't ‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è
---
Nope because then they're be nothing to sell you.
---
Thanks for listing, but none of these have the part I was looking for :( it‚Äôs when you‚Äôre in patrol it comes up sometimes
---
Its the one you get from purchasing an item from the bungie store
---
Nah, the game is just bad lol.
---
As someone who likes to invade using Sleeper Stimulant and the cheap thrill of causing salty rage, I too know the joy of depriving a team of 15 motes.
---
thank you very much! good to know!
---
Did you win?
---
Honestly debatable
---
When you go into the triumphs page go to cruicible then glory tab, you have to win games for one part of the game and then reach 2100 glory points in comp. Not sure how many games won you need but they can be from any game mode not just comp or 3v3 survival as it's known now
---
"Fire"
---
It‚Äôs a completely optional addition which you could totally play the game without. A thing to point out is any weapons or armor that you unlock come with bad rolls that way it‚Äôs not ‚Äúpay to win‚Äù. So it‚Äôs honestly up to your own decision as it doesn‚Äôt come with anything absolutely game changing.
---
Last I knew, if you owned Forsaken the rest of the DLCs were free.
---
Then it's one of the 5 unreleased ones. Sorry.
---
It‚Äôs not a pvp weapon. Never had been. It‚Äôs excellent in pve though.
---
I did every activity in the Dreaming City almost every day for since September of last year trying to get a Vouchsafe to drop from big baddies, chests, events, bounties, etc... Was the only Dreaming City item I didn't have. I just got it last week. If you're only 50 hours into the game, you're still in the baby steps. This game is grind heavy. If you want something, you have to work for it. Don't give up.
---
Probably, but on this subreddit almost everybody can agree it's not a good game. Go to fortnite's subreddit for more people with your opinion.
---
YA
---
YEEE^EEE^EEE^EEE^EEE^EEE^EEE^EEE^EEE^EEE
---
Its not \*good\* ... but it is *FUN.*
---
Find Xur. He‚Äôs around on the weekends and sells exotic weapons and armor for legendary shards. He‚Äôs currently at the tower behind the dead orbit stand and up a flight of stairs. For weapons he‚Äôs selling the Jade Rabbit for less than 30 legendary shards
---
I love the effect though. Makes the weapon unique and gives it more flare as an exotic. I‚Äôm new myself but I‚Äôm having a blast with it.
---
For those who don‚Äôt know left is Kratos and Thor, right is Dwight Schrute and Carol (bill murrays character from caddy shack). Honestly I think Dwight would be a great guardian
---
Honestly I don‚Äôt like fortnite, I think it‚Äôs annoying how everyone swarms and becomes a hivemind and shits on the game, everyone just bandwagons the hate train, because honestly the same thing happened and is still happening to destiny 2
---
–î–∞
---
Ahhh okay thanks
---
No you don‚Äôt need to buy other DLCs also. With the free to play release of the game you get the first two DLCs for free. Forsaken is not necessary but i highly recommend it for the storyline. But as I said it‚Äôs not necessary. If you don‚Äôt buy it I think you‚Äôre missing only the campaign, the strikes, and the raid and maybe the exotics.
---
I swear this is what happens to me every time I try to use GG in Crucible.
---
But I did one for bow, rifle and a handcanon I think. Only the rifle or the bow counted. :/
---
Specifically in comp/survival
---
2100 comp points and 100 wins. The 2100 is the easy part thanks to new crucible but the hardest part is the 100 wins. Such grind
---
What about pve players who hate using it just as much as they hate the crucible but just fucking want the recluse and mountaintop?
---
When a player has just spawned in, you can do damage but it won‚Äôt effect them for a short time. I‚Äôve shot someone in the head with a sniper and the it showed damage but he didn‚Äôt take any.
---
The game saw it as sufficient damage to activate vengeance even if none was actually inflicted.
---
Ya
---
Quick tip, if you transfer over your weapons and equip them. Then go into your collections and look at armour there should be a section called "leveling" which allows you to pull out a set of blue armour that should be relatively hight power.
---
Yw, if you like pushing yourself to the heights of competitive PVP, I think Not Forgotten is still attainable. It is a long range hand cannon (though not quite as long range as it used to be with the hand cannon changes). It has a unique perk making it still pretty deadly in the right hands. If you like scout rifles (basically semi automatic rifles) you can also go for the pvp scout rifle that requires some pvp from any mode and some competitive play. 
---
In addition to these PvP orientated weapons, you might look at other sources for weapons, including raids, forges, gambit and world drop/quest sourced exotic weapons.
---
Also if you press start and R1 over to the triumphs you can view all of them. That isn‚Äôt the only quest you will come across like that.
---
Don't fret I just finally got one last night after 75+ hours into Chad o'keefe
---
I have arrived.
---
Women don't exist. What are to talking about.
---
Thanks mate... the glory system seems to as well. Maybe a little too much.
---
I'm talking specifically for PVP. I don't mind if it's used for PVE but if someone plans on using the OEM **just** to win more in Crucible they should lose their internet.
---

Within like 3 hours of it being released whichever season that was
---
Btw y'all. Keep downvoting. I wanna knkw exactly how many bitches can fight without OP help
---
Soo much yes, the best feeling as a Titan when you kill three people with one ballistic slam
---
Standing on top of the statue‚Äôs head and just looking around was a daily ritual.
---
I mean that‚Äôs true but at the point that you‚Äôre running you‚Äôre well past the immunity frames, when your feet hit the ground you‚Äôre killable
---
The intro-Black Armory quest should give you a hammerhead, but that might have changed. Easiest other way is to do the Menagerie, but OP might need to grind his Chalice a bit
---
how easy is it to replace the harddrive? 
---
i was going to just put some $ aside for a pro but with the ps5 dropping next december it‚Äôs not even worth it
---
1. System
---
2. Use LFG if on Xbox, LFG discord if on PC, and PS4, not sure. Probably just the destiny app' fireteams section.
---
Shaxx‚Äôs unparalleled girth is the real reason I play this game. You can‚Äôt find shit like that in warframe
---
I hope your ghost had guiding light and you were on planet with clan mates!
---
Same boat. I'm on PS4. Same issue even after levelling past 780.
---
I mean. Just play around the objective? If you lose it it‚Äôs your own fault :D
---
Hell I‚Äôve even got an Antiope-D &amp; a Hero‚Äôs Burden That I‚Äôll use over recluse and have just as good a game quite consistently.
---
Sadly not really. An update to windows fixed mine. I wish I could tell you anything to help.
---
Do you do that through the vault?
---
Speed is great, sure, too bad the entirety of the game is an unbalanced catastrophe, the shooting feels terrible, the melee combat is just musou-tier button mashing, and the abilities are so broken you can literally press 4 and AFK with certain frames and watch everything in the zip code die.
---
There‚Äôs a certain point where the power fantasy becomes so intense it ends up being bland and uninteresting. That‚Äôs Warframe.
---
sounds good, harder the better.
---
should i wait to make the raid or just do it from the start? cause campaing is way too easy, its boring, idk why theyd do something like that makes no sense. i literally never die, one punch everything, bosses make an entrance but die faster than they spawned, and i never die. i only die by falling the map or because i wanna punch everything and something kills me.
---
Did it come with a new emblem?
---
I'll have a look, thanks for the help!
---
Not at all, pulse and hand cannon especially have been getting a lot of love from the community.
---
change your Steam name to Winnie the Pooh and the issue should go away
---
\-I'm Poor-
---
Hardcore player hear who's been sick and meh since launch, congrats man. Only up to 930 on my main
---
You don't understand. The content that's ftp right now came out for full price at launch. The total price of all the content, when originally launched, equals $320 which is absurd considering it's not even that much content to begin with compared to what Destiny started at.
---
Don't want to sound harsh man. But if you want fabled (easier than ever this season) then you should learn how to deal with titan charge. It's the exact same thing as shot gunners. Back peddle, map awareness, radar awareness. If you see someone being extremely aggressive on the radar it means they are aping u with shotgun or titan charge. Move away from the corner and get ready to fun them down. Titan charge is a huge investment and risk for a titan. If they fail and don't connect, they are locked in animation and will be gunned or even double melee disrespect down by you.

Where are you getting these made up numbers? All you need is Forsaken and Shadowkeep to have access to EVERYTHING.
---
(Forsaken) [https://store.steampowered.com/app/1090150/Destiny\_2\_Forsaken/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1090150/Destiny_2_Forsaken/)  $25 usd
---
AND
---
(Shadowkeep Base) [https://store.steampowered.com/sub/369781/](https://store.steampowered.com/sub/369781/)  $35 usd
---
OR
---
(Shadowkeep Deluxe - includes future content pass)  [https://store.steampowered.com/sub/369782/](https://store.steampowered.com/sub/369782/) $60 usd
---
So at max to buy COMPLETELY in, you're looking at $85 usd, or to just buy in to the current season without the future content pass $60 usd. So care to tell me where your $200 is coming from?
---
You can or you do it through the destiny app
---
I get what your saving and I'm most likely over-simplifying it but doesn't any eververse purchase bind to your Bungie account not the platform you are on? Meaning on your account it makes a mark saying "yep you bought an own this", and whatever accounts you have linked to your Bungie account are given access to it; like PC, Xbox, and PS4. Making the entitlement check null/void in the first place since everything would be on Bungie's side of your account not the platform's side. The platform only caring if you have the game since anything within Destiny itself would be outside of their control.
---
I don't anything about server side content verification so like I said I'm just theory-crafting.
---
To add to this, the weapons and armor are also available on the free track as well.
---
Problem is chat is opt-in, not opt-out, so they often won't even see it
---
I did the same exact thing with a fist of havoc slam lmao.
---
*Notices your pile of motes* UwU
---
Got'em!!!!
---
Kinderguardians dont exist anymore.
---
Bungie kind of shot that in the foot
---
Noted. What's the pink and blue one?
---
What, why O.O
---
I didn't know if I'd be playing for the next few years so I went with the cheaper version for now. It's $35 on steam and where I live there's a 10% vice tax - so \~38.5. Isn't that the normal price...?
---
Gambit Prime is meant to be a more "competetive" and also quicker experience. There are armor sets with the only 'set bonuses' in the game for Gambit Prime, obtained through the Reckoning (check the Drifter for a synthesizer to start obtaining the gear). You can also get unique weapon drops in Gambit Prime that you can't get in Gambit (you can get these weapons more reliably by doing Teir 2/3 Reckoning).
---
Aside from that, there's multiple small changes that should be googled to get the full run-down on. The two modes play similarly but have important differences beyond the loot and intention.
---
Destiny 3 could be a fresh start without bodged on solutions too stuff. At the moment a lot of the stuff in this game doesn't really fit in so well. Activities are just plastered on to such a point that they're no longer going to be temporary. 
---
I don't want d3 yet; there's still a lot of work bungie need to do to get things right. But perhaps year 5 can be d3. 
---
The 1st year can be full of content and a plentiful, longlasting endgame. The dlc releases can be  meaningful and much more tied into ALL of destiny.
---
A destiny developed solely by bungie and morphed with the community and dev experience.
---
Weird flex.
---
Thank you for the Tips, will dfntly try this
---
F
---
That's fair.
---
Dang. I ordered mine when it was announced, and I still did not get an update on it.
---
Don't you also already need to get kills with a machine gun for that?
---
Best guess for your very first Machine gun is Hammerhead from Ada-1 in the tower- she's the Black armor vendor.
---
Or the random exotic drop Thunderlord, though you'll gave to get Lucky with your exotic drops.
---
Don't do that. Don't give me hope.
---
What‚Äôs a good tip to rank up fast
---
China and not hacking in video games is a distant dream. Weird country lol. You probably would have been banned if you made this post and u happened to be from Hong Kong and if Bungie was still under Activision.
---
1. Ornaments are permanent, account-wide unlocks; they do not become consumed by being applied.
---
2. Armor stats and mods is best determined by your style. Even experienced PvP players will differ on how much they favor the classic Destiny 2 stats of Recovery (how quickly shield comes back), Resilience (how much effective hp you have), and Mobility (sprint speed and jump height).
---
In PvP Intelligence is hard to say no to in general because Supers can be so important, but specific builds can favor specific stats. For example, I'm being a terrible person with a 100-Discipline Handheld Supernova build in PvP right now.
---
i think he means they it wont let him progress through the campaign period. my friend is having the same problem he has done in the deep 3 times now and it is not letting him progress through the campaign
---
Blue is Arc and Purple is Void
---
Stop. Get some help.
---
I'm glad that I have  a group of freinds that helped me catch up on the game before shadowkeep
---
Do you play with other people?   If so party up and hold all the completed bounties til you are all together and have the shared wisdom buff.  It helps a ton in leveling
---
What's the best way to get enhancement cores?
---
OH THAT'S A SUPERFAIL
---
Perhaps, in turn the US will stop habitually fucking up their home countries.
---
You would've never survived college when Halo was a thing.
---
Yes, but where's the outrage?
---
You should be able to go to your collections and reacquire it
---
Hey. Does anyone know where the gravetide summoner is located this week?
---
I fucked up my transfer and I can't get my character back.
---
1. All dependant on playstyle. I've really enjoyed pumping up one stat as high as it can go, Discipline on Warlock and Strength on Titan are my two favorite builds right now. For some classes and some builds that might be less important and a well-rounded stat layout best (bottom tree Sunbreaker, for instance, might not need Discipline/Strength at all because of Sun Spots).
---
2. I honestly can't remember. I don't believe so, though. If you're wanting to farm a weapon, note that most of the "meta' weapons (Spare Rations, Lone Survivor, Last Man Standing) are in the T2 pool of weapons.
---
I loved the factions. Damn shame.
---
I was looking at release prices, OP was creating a hypothetical where the buyer would purchase all the content as soon as it released. Honestly that's  even worse, cause if you bought everything originally and then it all became a third of the price
---
So for completing one of the introduction quests I had to beat a Nightfall Strike. I was a bit confused that I had to play it solo but oh well. I chose the Exodus Crash one.
---
Was hard but managed to make it to the last boss. 2 hours and a nearly broken headset later I gave up. 
---
Am i supposed to beat that thing solo or is it normal to get bodied by the last boss?
---
They made it so that the exotics you get from the campaign don‚Äôt drop in the story anymore
---
A 900rpm sub with surrounded or rampage would shred the exact same way.
---
Thank you, I appreciate it as this is the first time I‚Äôve ever tried making a music type video.  So we‚Äôll see if I make any more in the future.
---
You need to talk to Ada and complete a Powerful Machine Gun Frame quest to access the Forges at first; after that all forges are unlocked for you and are on a daily rotating schedule.
---
You can buy them from Spider at Tangled Shore and I believe you have a chance of getting them from dismantling legendary gear.
---
Synthoceps for the insane range ;)
---
Yes definitely do go in the same side as breaking the shield breaks the floors. Therefore opening less portals makes it easier on everyone. So basically; 
---
 Team 1 goes right &gt; Team 2 goes right &gt; Team 1 goes left &gt; Team 2 goes left &gt; dps &gt; repeat.
---
Yo my dude! What hood is that!?
---
Noice!
---
Mine shipped out a day ago.
---
The Ace of Spades specifically refers to the Forsaken expansion. You'll need to own that expansion to be able to get that exotic (all but 4 year-2 exotics ‚Äî all weapons ‚Äî are only accessible if you own Forsaken).
---
Get a fireteam together or you‚Äôre gonna have a hard time. Also your power advantage caps out at 20 over the requirement for the activity. You could be 950 and not do more damage than you are now
---
Thanks guys
---
You should see several quests from Lord Shaxx, the Crucible Vendor (if you don't then you *might* need to power up to Light Level 900, but I don't believe that's the case). The only requirement for Recluse is to reach 2100 glory rank, obtainable in the Survival Playlists.
---
One of you HAS to be using Rat King. I just did the Ordeal with the quest and my bf used rat king and I completed it once we were done.
---
Those stats do not change, no. If you see differences it's because of the random perks/mods making those changes.
---
I'm not homosexual...but I'd consider it for a night if it meant I could get my hands on volume 1.
---
Pretty sure it's better to just do the normal cryo pods ones than just go into the bearest lost sector to farm completions in a matter of seconds
---
Kratos And cayde equals lots of boy
---
I assume you‚Äôre new to destiny
---
Sad for sure, but 100% reasonable. I've always hoped for an 'Exotics for all' day for like an April's Fool day event or something, but I expect Bungie's a bit terrified of the bugs that might open up. Several builds would be beyond broken with even being able to equip two exotic armor pieces.
---
There used to be heroics on mars and mercury all the time. Did they change that?
---
What I mean is. That initial cabal invasion. The opening scene, losing your light. I want to do that again. But you just go to the cosmodrome instead now. I want the original intro
---
It did reset, yes.
---
