I just can't stop looking at the thicc booty even though I want to.
---
---
---
I did but that's cuz those slots aren't having something else put in them
---
I love what you did for Two-tailed Fox, looks sweet!
---
I just applied; hope I did it right, and that I'm not to far back in the game to be accepted. I'm certainly an adult, and I just got the D2 app, although I've had the PS App and discord for a while.

I did it it’s not that bad you have to go through all campaigns and unlock supers but that’s it you keep all progress and if you put the gear in the vault you can put it on the new titan
---
I’m sorry I have to admit I bought it after Croats end. I am not a true vet feelsbadman
---
I didn't wanna spoil that for my girlfriend since she just started playing and loves cayde as a character, it got ruined for her when I was turning in a box to tess and she was peaking over my shoulder, she saw that he dies and got really depressed for the rest of the day.
---
Gambit is the dude with the scarf around his head yeah?
---
Don't worry you are still a Guardian who has lived a crazy time in d1.
---
This is awesome
---
Literally the only thing cool about the armour is the cloak on hunter and airplane head for titan
---
ITS WORTH IT THO

 from the above list of violations no

 he could. I have a similar problem

Sadly no. Didnt think about it at the time, wish i had though.
---
Yeah, actually I’m kind of in the same boat. Got Tarrabah week one on my first clear ever, and I just got a second one this week, but no Anarchy yet. I don’t have 1k either but that’s mainly cause I don’t like running last wish that much.
---
Step one: Equip Attunment of Sky (top tree dawnblade).
---
Step two: Use weapons with good in air accuracy. 
---
Step three: Get good with Icarus Dash and Winged Sun.
---
Step four: Realize you don't need those stupid one shot nades anyway.
---
Very strong HC? Check 
---
Very strong shotty? Check
---
LMG? Check

One piece of LW armour(most likely enhanced)? Check

Unbroken title? Check

This guy is a bona fide no life

OK well good luck with it. I have not seen numerous posts about people being banned for no reason in the last few days line what the link you posted suggests.
---
Found the shotgun, OEM scrublord
---
Holy shit... this honestly could mean a new element type!
---
stop stealing stuff from r/DestinyMemes
---
you have to have a gold frame ready to pop to get them if you didn't know. not sure how you haven't gotten it if that's 100 alpha frames...
---
If you time your sword slam at the moment the ogre slams, it will negate the ogre slam.
---
Yup me too😂
---
There's also a fighting lion sparrow shown just before the jotuun one
---
So here's how I see it. You could be a complete disgrace of a human being who thrives off the pain of others and making other people suffer because you can't get over your own personal issues. So you take it out on other people through video games (which is pretty sad really) because you yourself ,are too weak to pick on anybody face to face. 
---
Or you could be a desperate troll who craves attention of any form, negative or positive because mommy, daddy or god knows who else didn't give you enough attention growing up. Given your post history, I'd say you're both of these bud.  Do everybody here a favour and leave this community. There is no place for people like you here.
---
That's EXACTLY why I watched megamind today
---
When did Genji get a gun?
---
Don't listen to them. Watch Megamind
---
Trinity Ghoul. Fires 3 arrows and charges said arrows after a headshot.
---
Xol
---
From where?
---
The malfeasance is really good for gambit and PvP. I personally use it in a lot of taken activities too like Last Wish, Shattered Throne, or the Lake of Shadows strike. Im sure you'll enjoy the gun regardless of the activity.
---
As a pixel artist myself, very epic, I love it.
---
Ah, another schaffrillas fan.
---
My bad thought it said the gun and catalyst
---
Just go claim any bounties you have completed and you will spawn in
---
The tribute hall weapons are all associated with the types of enemies in the game(fallen, hive, vex, cabal), the Valkyrie is a warmind weapon. It isn’t created or used by an enemy type.
---
r/fortnite is the zombie horde mode.
---
This deserves way more upvotes
---
Since no one is getting giving you the real answer, I got you.
---
Just got released on Netflix. And it's fucking awesome.
---
Voice lines in the Tower during The Dawning last year spoiled it for me. I picked up vanilla when it was free and hadn’t made it to the Forsaken campaign yet.
---
Apparently console players need traction to have their controls work right.
---
I thought you said foreskin
---
But why though
---
Personally leavers should be given 1 warning then a 3 day ban, then a 7 then a 14, doubling everytime. If you leave more than one game in a season you kinda deserve it. Only reason i say one per season at all is sometimes life happens. Sometimes your dog falls down the stairs, rolls into the kitchen eats all its food in 3 seconds flat, gets sick, throws up in the floor, and needs to be comforted for a few minutes or taken to the vet. Your choice. But yea sometimes shit goes down.
---
Worth every second
---
Yep sorry for the slow reply I was out.
---
You just never quit, do you?

At least it actually takes some effort to get
---
No need to apologise I really appreciate it
---
It's up to you, Mr. Manager!
---
"Oh great, I'm Mr. Manager!"
---
You just say Manager
---
If you have any other questions I’ll be down to answer them if I can that is.
---
Lol do you even statistics bro? If your kd is actually 1.41 then you are far far better than the majority of players.
---
You'd have to wait for crossave, I didn't get any veteran emblems and I went from xbox to pc, I even connected the accounts
---
If you hate it that much play on console. We're still doing it with chaperone
---
Here let me help you, rapid fire frames shoot at 140 rpm allowing them to easily 2 hit body, FYI 140 rpm is the same as ace to give you an example of how fast that is. Just think for a moment and you’ll realize what I meant buddy.
---
Very cool!
---
Now replace stompees with skyburners oath and you get my run!
---
I love the truth and thunderbird designs
---
Actually feels like you have input delay without traction it’s really annoying.
---
Ah. I see you’re a survivor as well
---
Is that the extra-wide boy? Reminds me of a tortoise shell for whatever reason
---
Don’t forget Lumina.
---
That's really dumb. Bungie should honestly just scrap traction and build it into armor pieces on console. As far as I can see it's absolutely necessary on console and completely worthless on PC. So it's in a weird spot for both
---
Bungie please add this to the game. I'll pay to have a chance of getting it
---
This is probably the last post in this thread and about my love.
---
I realized that all do not care and people just laugh at others
---
Thank you for these 2 beautiful years of Bangui, for a balance that does nothing, for bans without a reason,
---
Give thanks. I would have survived this if I hadn’t bought a $ 1,500 computer for Destiny.
---
I will not say thanks to people who do not consider this problem a normal situation (they spit and laugh)
---
I could name all but one
---
(The black Trace rifle) (does anyone know what that one is)
---
Sad because you’ve spent your time playing this game for so long that you’ve memorized that many, 
---
or sad because you’ve spent your time playing this game for so long and you still don’t know all of them?
---
I rarely pop my super until the boss or a very opportune moment. The main plus to JooJoo is generating super. For people who pop it as soon as it’s available it would be a viable weapon. I absolutely don’t need the incremental super addition from this one and I value my kinetic slot for other weapons that are much more fun for me to use. Again, not trying to bend people out of shape by saying I don’t really like the thing. It’s just not worth the exotic for me.
---
Man I want his Retold Tale that is such a good roll I assume it’s the God roll but don’t know the barrel
---
If these were stickers or something of the sort id buy em ngl
---
Perfect thank you!!!
---
Every single point of masterwork gives you 1% damage resilience in your super so if you have 4 pieces fully masterworked that's 20%. Makes a big difference.
---
Ha lol
---
Thats all cool. You'll probably enjoy it though. This latest season alone is probably worth it. But we'll get you sorted out.
---
Sounds good to me thanks!
---
Seems *really* shitty. 
---
It's one thing to tweak your controls to do this in a single-player grind, but to do this in a team where other people are relying on your contribution is just garbage.
---
I’m finishing up my 5th reset
---
Meanwhile make sure to pick up those bounties from Banshee, they give mod components and enhancement cores.
---
Banshee also sells mods on random daily rotation.
---
It was perfect. Range masterwork, rifled barrel, accurized rounds
---
You gotta work for that. Calus sells something that each time you buy it, it’ll reduce the cost of everything by 1%. Buy it 80 times it’s a permanent 80% discount. Takes a while though
---
Its imperial dress from Crown of sorrow
---
Wow lol and I assume he got it pretty early to rack up those kills..Wonder if he farmed or got lucky either way ggs to him..A lot of shotgun kills he deserved the god roll
---
Yup! Trying to stack up on Enhancement cores for ShadowKeep but they’re never enough. Especially since now I’m trying to level up my Titan as well as my regular warlock and hunter. Hopefully they’re all around 700 by the time September rolls around.
---
I still havent done it yet
---
What?
---
You see, the problem with generalising a class into real people, it makes no sense. I'm not going to act like someone else just because I play the same class as them.
---
I absolutely complain when hunters/warlocks suck, and I've definitely shot down plenty of irrational "x class is op" posts, because very generally it's folks who play another class that don't understand the weaknesses of said class and only ~~see~~ remember the strengths.
---
Take your own advice and be rational.
---
I'm talking about the retold tale, not the armor
---
This is great info, thanks much!
---
Whether you want it or not...
---
I mean tbh this would incur a ton of work since Bungo would have to add collisions to hundreds of remotes and also physics etc.
---
There’s 2 legend of acrius basically the quest is you get a prototype one that has no perks and is only260 light and you upgrade it by doing the rest of the quest and you get one that has full perks and can be infused to 750 light
---
This guy had to use the term ‘dad rifle’ 3 time in one post to convince himself he doesn’t want it, so salty and toxic, lmao!
---
This is proof that the sun is in fact not real and is actually fake news created by the traveler
---
Yes
---
The quest is after you beat the raid and the strike you get a prototype acrius the you upgrade it but getting kills in different ways with the prototype then you get seals from the raid then after that you get the actual weapon
---
First we got Sunshot Ghost, then we get Jötunn Sparrow, what's next? Fighting Lion ship?
---
Ow, right. Yeah, i didn't know this since i've never finished it. Thanks
---
Damn these forges must have black holes or somethin mans got his own orbit
---
Yup
---
You never noticed that it was only 260 light and had no perks and only 1 shot
---
Good shit man GG
---
The level 11 did better then me lol
---
Was it a random or did you guys have communication?
---
You will get 120 bonus points if you played 3 comp matches this week
---
Not going to lie here, when I first started playing Destiny 2 my favourite activity was using this emote and sitting in various places at the farm
---
Random. I litterly did nothing for the first 2 mins cuase I was like fuck my life never going to win and he just kept getting kills so I just went with it.
---
Damn congrats to both of you, credit were credit is due my man👏🏻
---
I am Keyhead
---
I'm mediocre in the crucible but I remember my first quick scoped, I've never been able to replicate since.
---
Sad part is khepris sting used to be good *le sigh*
---
The queen is tho
---
Go into your pursuits then back out again
---
The queen is tho. Lets piss off shaxx, I want the game to finally let me fight him
---
Will try that if it happens again. 👍
---
So.. I've purchased a Google stadia which comes with all dlc on release, I already own all dlc up to shadowkeep on pc, so I need to rebuy shadowkeep once I go from stadia to pc or are dlc's account bound?
---
Me too

Will I keep my triumph for the MMXIX seal? That’s the only reason I cheesed for the gun tbh
---
I think a Fireteam of Veterans should get together and do a Raid together
---
Drlame
---
Interesting.
---
Ohh thanks, I've gotten a few of them before but never thought much on it
---
This is incredible!
---
I think we all know the answer to that one boss

The sparrow is really cool, can recommend

I tried and failed a lot lol to do this congratulations buddy well deserved

This is amazing!!! ... 1k is a little of though.

Might as well lol what's it called?

I'll tell ya through my Hunter and Titan playthrough all I could hear was somber music and his dialogue overshadowing everything (gun fire etc)
---
It worked for me, when I went into pursuits a blank bounty completed itself. I waited for pursuits to load and went back in game, after a few seconds it worked.
---
i'm getting mine legit as well. i know some people poo poo it, but anymore it seems like cheeses and glitches are a part of the destiny experience. i'm amazed sometimes at the ingenuity of people that find ways around content
---
Increased RNG man everyone knows it
---
An F in chat for the Hunter who was trying to get mountaintop with that tether. F
---
Hahahahaha 
---
This guy doesn’t play titan
---
In the arms of the angellllll
---
Oh I agree some of the ways they find this stuff is mad clever. But I am kinda happy they are locking the items out from ppl that did the cheese. Too many cocky people running round bragging with that damn emote right now
---
My will to continue playing 😔🤙🏻
---
I was using well so the orbs wouldnt kill me
---
And I thought the guy with 15000 kills on his Dust Rock Blues had a lot.
---
haha, that's awesome!
---
I did that yesterday and jumped off my sparrow before hitting the ground. The sparrow bounced off the gound and killed me &gt;.&lt;
---
Is it op?
---
I look at it like it's a fusion rifle with no buildup.
---
It's one of those exotics that is just a diffirent class of weapon and a 'bit more' damage than usual.
---
Says the Hunter running a sword. What good is Lunafactions gonna do ya, bud?
---
I was so tempted to cheese it but I decided I wanted the immersion of the quest, so I’ve spent the last week grinding out those tributes. Just got the Bad Juju today!
---
To say in former times, it was easy to do flashpoints on Mercury since it said "do public events and kill Mercury attackers/defenders". But now it seems that doing 10 times the lost sector with bad JuJu is the fastest way.
---
*slide* into the horde

Well, the program doesn't matter if you have the skill, which I sadly don't xD
---
Oh shit I forgot about this, my Hunter is already 745 and my Warlock is around 720, but my Titan Is like 200 power so I have to run through the stupid Red War, Curse, Warmind, AND Forsaken AGAIN. Borefest. Anyways, thank you!
---
So, does anyone else feel like Izanagi's should have doubled as a sword once you ran out of ammo?
---
I mean, look at it. I just want to grab it by the stock and swing it around.
---
the big trash - the bigger trash
---
Try to do the forges at 300 power and then come back to me
---
My friend did the cheese, I sent him this and now all a sudden the weapon sucks and it trash anyway. 😂
---
Please tell me this is a joke, please
---
exotic power baby!
---
well, I’m going to be honest, I actually use thorn over last word because the recoil is absurd and I don’t exactly prefer hipfire and also console
---
So a cheese that you can do is good cuz it does not affect you negatively, but another cheese is bad becouse they can use a gun from it?
---
Do kinetic weapons deal 5% more?
---
g a m e   e n d   h i m
---
And?  that's some real shit where kids die, man.  Not funny, not cool.  Tasteless.
---
A N G E R
---
Lol sorry I’m not actually open, I was just making a joke because my flair is what you were talking about
---
You can blame the tower attack on the "Nine", lots of lore points to the fact they helped to hide the red legion.  I suspect the vanguard knew about the Black armory, but what would be the point of removing them or interferring? 
---
Half of Destiny 1 was on the Moon, hell we beat Crota there, The Hellmouth says I remember you haha
---
yes
---
I'm not one bit guilty that I did the cheese. I just don't play Destiny like that anymore, and of I tried getting bad juju legit my already-low material count would drop farther and make me want to play the game even less
---
He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defences, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold.
---
I don't know, but I still think it's dumb a kinetic does more damage than a power
---
Haha, I did spot that
---
Right? Like, its in the same picture.  A "Fighting Lion" sparrow right behind.  I'd be embarrassed about this post. XD
---
In the ditch along with this joke
---
How are they being punished? They literally have not completed the requirements for the Catalyst. Also, Bungie was nice enough to not take the gun away even though they didn't earn that either.
---
They have plenty of time to complete the requirements for the Catalyst before the patch.
---
IKR?  I went into some 700+ matchmaking the other day and saw people doing AFK at that point.  Was like WTF?  Do they not understand they can lower their light and not affect anyone?  A farming cheese that hurts no one = poifect.
---
You are your own worst enemy!
---
when lord of wolves gets nerfed it will become the lord of nothing
---
probably
---
I like to block others using craniums to break crystals, while I empty one into thin air.
---
It's great! The best part is that it isn't ruining games for people like you see them do in gambit or crucible with macros. A cheese with no victims lol.
---
To be fair redrix is the most grindy of all the quest I have LH and recluse and close to revoker and I still am working on redrix
---
It’s almost always in my gambit loadout. I tend to play more a sentry role. Shooting Taken blockers works great with the buff against taken, and it can own invaders pretty solid. Even without the taken enemies it’s a good enough hand cannon. 
---
I will say that if you’re not in gambit or fighting hella taken it’s a bit of a waste of an exotic slot. 
---
After an enemy has been hit 5 times it does extra damage, and that stacks with teammates also using Malfeasance, so if you got a fireteam using them you can potentially do a lot of damage to majors and bosses but there’s a lot of better options. Again, I love it in gambit, rarely use it elsewhere.
---
Classic move.
---
I’ve had a game with 58 notes deposited, 48 enemy’s killed, 8 guardians defeated and 67 or 77% primeval damage. We won :)
---
how do people even have ideas this good
---
Given the amount of kills, someone is definitely lacking the D
---
Ok indeed
---
crota taught us a lot
---
Use a full auto scout rifle with explosive rounds and a tracking rocket launcher and short from a distance
---
Sameee you wanna join me on PS4?
---
yep lol
---
Depends upon what you want for ROF.  My preference is the Ace because of Firefly (and my devotion to Cayde...) but close behind that is Malfeasance.  Thorn is still a good HC due to it's poison effects.
---
Feels good carrying a Gambit match, much more than Crucible.
---
Lol I’m the opposite, got nf in the first month but can’t get a group for a raid...
---
I like Mercury...it's gorgeous!
---
The whole thing baffles me. I've never properly got into Destiny until the last few weeks but the amount of people I see who are happy that others get things taken away is kind of super pathetic. I can get Bungie fixing stuff like afk farming, that behaviour is actively detrimental to others. How does somebody cheesing to get virtual items negatively affect you? Totally baffles me. 
---
I agree with Bungie fixing it but power to the people to enjoy something while it lasts. I disagree with people lording it over them though, but I guess this is why people play the game. Insane grinds so you can flex your e-peen. Not surprising such people get salty when there's a shortcut I guess.
---
yo ok man ill join you whats ur psn
---
As your Glory score increases so does the talent pool you matchmake in.
---
It’s punishing for solo players unless you’re Frostbolt or something.
---
Try to scrounge up a team of 3 good players but make sure their scores are close to yours (or preferably below yours) because the game reads the player with the highest Glory rank and pools you with other players in that ranking group.
---
I’ve been chasing Recluse for weeks buddy. It’s brutal. 
---
Other things to remember: if you play at least 3 games a week you will automatically get 120 Glory points at reset on Tuesday. Once you get around the 1500+ Glory rank you’ll really want to chose your battles wisely. As getting into a losing streak can really mess up your progress. It’s like a casino...you gotta learn when to walk away. 
---
Good luck Guardian!
---
what are you on for redrix?
---
best range on any smg in the game, but recluse still exists
---
I will try that next. Thanks. I’ve been trying to use hammerhead
---
At this point I don't blame people who cheese it
---
Just do it there's no penalty and no one really cares
---
Amphetamines
---
For me I got one every day from my first node I opened that day. Past that, nothing.
---
I just want to do some exotic gun quests and then I run into OEM striker recluse mountaintop Titan.
---
Every...single...qp games...
---
Suck the fun out of everything.
---
Last Stand was my favourite part of the Oryx fight
---
Hahahaha!!
---
You can search on the main destiny sub for a full breakdown, but if you can get to 1980 the reset bonus will get you to 2100. I think the weekly bonus is higher at lower ranks, as is the gain for wins and streaks.
---
I want to. I’m willing to learn. I just don’t have any luck with LFG as my windows of opportunity are small with 4 little ones running around.
---
Lol same here, going for a mask on Hunter. Sucks. I especially hate when people take the invasion portal when it is obvious I need it/have the advantage in invading
---
And we all had to listen to it countless times waiting for whisper, it's ingrained in my memory.
---
What the fuck
---
Winning games are worth 60, 80, 100, 120, 140 glory based on your win streak, so if you can win two games in a row and then lose one you'll have gained 80 glory. The weekly reset gives you 120 glory as long as you've played 3 games. Once you get to fabled this number gets lower.
---
160pts first 2 ranks 120pts next 2 80pts 5th 0pts 6th is -points. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
For this you can calculate 120 points a week safely.
---
_acshually_ Zavala dun goofed us all up in the red war! His line was like _the traveler can wait_ or some dumb shit like that. I literally said “The fuck!?” out loud when I heard him say that. Sure enough the put a lock on our power source. Millions died... we lost our gjallys, he’s been a sad boi ever since.
---
Thanks
---
During double and triple valor you get resets pretty quickly even if you're not winning a ton of games. Make sure to also be doing bounties as they give you valor now and the multiplier also applies to them. I usually get 2 to 3 resets every time Iron Banner rolls around.
---
This is literally me as well. In PvE it’s almost non stop headshots but once I’m in PvP I’m like a drunk walrus
---
What system are you on and during what time frames are you available?
---
There is a reason i dont have the recluse.
---
I went from being about the best PvP-player of my clan to being inconsistent and at some times mediocre at best recently. My favorite loadout did not get nerfed. Meta hasn't changed in a way that affected me. No logical explanation.
---
Has anyone else experienced/overcome something like this? I've tried many new loadouts and have found a few that worked okay, but nothing quite clicked or worked for the long term.
---
That's great progress man, most people give up without ever seeing 10%. The gun is definitely a beast everyone should try and get it.
---
I play quickplay in a stack a lot but it's only because my team already has everything we need out of all the other 6 player activities, so it's just something fun we can play together to pass the time.
---
Search up Heros of light emblem on google. It looks nice
---
That’s not how it works.
---
Jokes on you I can’t play for the next week
---
Same. I just feel better knowing that they took the time to write something and then they can't send it lol
---
Masochists or people snorting colombian party powder is my guess
---
4 rank ups in as in Brave 2? I mean its still 100% doable, it just requires more effort the further below 1200 you are.
---
I'm just asking, I'm a new player
---
Yikes, that was a fast repost
---
Take your downvote, redditard
---
You know there is a colourblind mode in the options right? :p
---
Eternal warrior sucks. It’s only viable in one super specific instance and it’s garbage for everything else
---
Good job!!! I hope I can pull that off too!
---
Guess who has now the legit tributes 😮
---
Those barrels were life savers when that content was at level. Now I'm pretty sure they and up killing me more since I'm not scrutinizing the engagements as much, especially when solar burn is active
---
This cheese replaces a lot of farming for materials and playing a wide variety of activities, with loading into a zone 50 times.
---
Compare that to the cheese for gaining additional boons per day, where you do the same work, theoretically more since you are less able to cherry pick bounties, but in less time.
---
You can technically get 2 in one curse cycle, if you're online and in the throne room during the reset, you can open the chest again after the reset. Something like that.
---
Ah ok, thanks
---
So you are using recluse mountain top ultra meta bs and are complaining about dying to a charged grenade?
---
You have my attention now. I mained WG with devour until forsaken, so I'd imagine it has to do with the buff the lost sector bosses got when they became "Wanted," but I'm not sure.
---
Outbreak perfected, recluse, spike nade option grenade launcher or wendigo, high powered shotguns, bad juju
---
I used to think everyone was a bit mellow dramatic about Mercury. I've working on a new character recently though, and I hated doing the curse of Osiris content. Now I'm light level 735 and I still haven't even started Warmind haha
---
Outbreak prime, spike grenade launchers, ikelos shotgun
---
We are German and we pronounce Primevil German just for the meme
---
What console do you play on?
---
Really but is loading into a zone 50 times more negative than AFK farming a forge for HOURS at a time and getting tons of planetary mats? At least this is a event specific cheese the Forge farming is good for the ENTIRE GAME and way more broken if you ask me. Not saying either is good or right but I am way more concerned with peeps getting unlimited planetary mats and using them in a VARIETY of ways than someone getting one gun.
---
I'm the opposite.  Love me some PvP.
---
It’s pretty rough, just stick with it and you can get there. If I can you can. They made it slightly easier with the weekly reset points but it’s tough for average players to get there, but they can.
---
You are going to hit walls and get crappy matchups. My advice is to take your time, take advantage of the weekly resets, pair up for a bit, go solo for a bit and you will get there in the end.
---
“There isn’t any honor in comp”
---
Boy you can say that again, when I load into a comp match and my team has 3 people I’m furious but if they do it is no mercy.
---
I don't really want them to work on it at this point. A sparrow isn't going to make me want to go to Mercury any more haha
---
Yea your personal messaging system may need a tune up
---
The recluse and the mountaintop from crucible, if you could get the anarchy and a good roll for swarm of the raven. Obtain outbreak prime, good for lfg groups and nostalgia.
---
Spawns desperately need to be fixed
---
Normally I'd be cool with people cheesing stuff in pve in ways that doesn't affect others, but yeah, I can't accept working my ass off to get all 50 tributes for an emote, when some people who wouldn't even bother trying without the glitch get it for loading into the zone 50 times.
---
This... ☝🏻
---
It may not have the range of PC LoW, it still has the damage. It still shuts down supers fastest.
---
There was a graph done even by a really good player, that compared wins at different levels of comp play both solo and in groups.
---
Solo play always has a significant drop in win %.
---
I don't have to enjoy or play Crucible all that much to have it.
---
&gt; unfair for casual players 
---
I would argue that casual players don't care about pinnacle weapons.  They are not impossible to get.  You need skill and a good fireteam.  Can be done solo too, but will take a bit longer depending on the players skill level and teammates.
---
That’s not how exotic engrams work, you’re gonna get more duplicates than you are new stuff
---
I mean, the Moment of Triumph one is pretty easy to do if you have done Last Wish, Scourge and the new raid.
---
You should quit and show Bungie you have conviction in your complaint.
---
Check Tess every week, you might get lucky as I've now seen the black armory ornaments for Gambit weapons there. Hopefully she sells it for you soon
---
The only time I was good at PvP was the latest Iron Banner, where my Smugglers Word seemed to melt health bars.
---
Fact
---
As a star wars loving jew I'm fine with my name
---
I was a filthy casual on PC. 
---
I was scared even considering playing with mnk. 
---
I was so bad, but after hard 5 months of everyday playing one hour the crucible, and sweating my ass of, I managed to get better. 
---
This journey will never be *not forgotten* 
---
Just play and get better, it helps.
---
This is a known issue and bungie basically said avoid these activities for now. So in a way it's sort of your own fault for continuing.
---
"Nailed it."
---
I would assume there is a support area on the website.
---
Indeed.
---
Rush 2049 anyone?
---
I'd say the proportions are a bit off for a few of them, but this still looks amazing! I wish I had the skill and time to do stuff like this!
---
The only thing that makes me blood pressure ride more than PvP is players using AFK macros in PvE.
---
I don’t keep up with these things, and I’d been told by some others that it had been fixed. Thanks though.
---
And Oathkeeper?  
---
It looks cool but it's useless ain't it
---
not even flexing but this is the opposite, i’m kinda bad at pve lmao i only play pvp
---
I just got done submitting an issue but they don’t have a direct email so I guess we’ll see. Thank you,
---
I’ve not set foot in the whisper. I don’t have a really strong fireteam most of the time (not that I am a beast) and I really dislike jumping puzzles lol
---
From experience, losing connection with the server is client side the majority of the time. Even seemingly small hiccups from your ISP is enough to get out of sync with the server. Sometimes instead of trying again you should abstain to prevent exactly what happened with you.
---
This is me, I’m trying to get recluse on pc and it’s been pretty easy up until now around 700 points but I’m just scared of letting my team down and someone getting mad at me :/
---
PVP is garbage and it’s holding back PVE. They need to separate the 2 in balancing and everything.
---
wait riven can be killed by it i was talking about the spire boss
---
maul is balanced? its the worst pvp super in the game...
---
Not true. Kobe came to my house AND I've been hitting the court for 3 hours a day... I'm still shit at crucible
---
doodoodoodoodoo DUUUUUNNNNNN DUNNNNNNN
---
DUN DAH DUUUUUUUUNNNNN
---
I believe the first win is 40 points, correct me if Im wrong.
---
Ok only because I'm stupid here's my question. 
---
Let's say this week I play three matches plus. Then on reset when I load in I get the bonus points.   Or 
---
Do I have to play A total of three matches after reset to get the bonus points.  
---
Only reason why I ask is that my current score is 2048.  So one will will put me over but sence I've been useing rng to find teams it's been a struggle. I'm trying to make the best possible choice. If I have to play three anyways I might as well play the odds.
---
aim *slightly* above their head. Like put the dot of your reticule on the tippy top of their dome. 
---
Also, try playing around with your sensitivity settings.
---
Try using targeting perks and mods to see if that helps.
---
They get the gun.. (I agree people should do it themselves, but I just wanted to answer you question. Just a concerned guardian here and didn't want anyone not knowing the answer)
---
Have you ever read. It’s says only 4 discount a day on the bounty
---
I'm doing that just before shadowkeep. Like the week before
---
Its a 4 per day per account thing
---
NP man. Also, if it helps you should be able to snag the 50k score fairly easily with just 1 other player. I didn't even bother finding a 3rd and me and the rando I found got it done quick.
---
Oh ok, thx
---
yeah but i would prefer 3 just incase
---
Doing raids for 1k
---
Search bar.
---
Ps4?
---
I see you like memes Guardian, just in case you haven't heard of it already I bet you'd like r/DestinyMemes.
---
My days of breaking knee caps with the last word are put to rest for now. I've been using rose a lot lately.
---
Yeah I have PS4
---
Love them  there awesome
---
Maybe I'm just wired differently from other people, but if I did this then every time I used that gun it would be gnawing at the back of my mind "you couldn't do it." and it would be worse than not having it at all.
---
Thanks!!
---
Is the ghost right under ya tit? You must REALLY like this game lol (Btw I have a Hunter tattoo I'm just playing)
---
Message Cornelius23rd on PSN. I'll send you a clan invite. We raid pretty frequently. We have max clan rank for this season already too. Go ahead and send me a friend request if you want.
---
r/whoosh
---
I’m at 26 completions I’m really close to quitting scourge it’d be nice to get anarchy because it’s the only exotic I don’t have but I just wanna stop...
---
her face when she sees shaxx in crucible and has a novabomb
---
(seriously she's the best crucible warlock in recorded history)
---
People are down voting you because it ain’t obvious at all.
---
Or did that go over your head r/whoosh
---
Yea, this meme is irrelevant
---
That Tom Cruise center tooth though
---
I guess checking who cheesed the outbreak is way more difficult than checking who has not 50 triumphs placed.
---
Ahhh ok I’ll do that next time. Thanks for the tip!
---
Next week is bonus valor. You can easily get 2 resets in on iron banner week if you focus pvp that week
---
I didn’t sound serious at all either, I even added one of the :C faces hoping people would see that and think oh he joking but apparently not, an also you can’t whoosh someone on their own joke when you didn’t get the joke
---
I think those arms have a good perk but there's much better things you could be using in terms of exotic armor. You can find gear that reloads your weapons faster instead of using those and I would say worm husk or liars handshake with top tree arcstrider is really good or you could use Orpheus rigs with nighstalker. Also ikeos sg is very good for your energy slot
---
You are probably the least toxic PvP player I've ever seen
---
Anything that goes over someone’s head is a woosh. That’s what that sound effect is....
---
Also the :C makes it actually look more genuinely sad and upset lol.
---
I’ve had 3v3 but not 4v3, crucible is in a dark place rn
---
Ok, thanks a lot! i have lots of exotic leg armor, but i'm using midtree nighstalker, so i wasn't using orpheus rig.
---
Thanks for the feedback! I actually reworked a lot this song, on another post, if you want to check the final result :
---
Wait, the postmaster sells random rolls?!!?!
---
/s
---
I went to the tower the other day and a few players were kicking around but all the vendors were gone. I was just walking around like "are we closed today and nobody told me?"
---
