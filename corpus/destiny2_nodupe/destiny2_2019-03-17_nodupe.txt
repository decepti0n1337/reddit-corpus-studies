---
All characters are lvl 50
---
That's due to an exotic and the person continually getting kills and activating it, I do notice it does take a lot of damage to take a hunter down in spectral blades though, they are quite tough considering how nimble and agile they are.
---
Nah, you're good.  
---
Even without the exotic, it lasts too long for the potential it has
---
Not too many folks are doing the guided games thing. You maybhave an easier time at r/fireteams

Statement

I‚Äôve ran Leviathan many times and never once have I ever heard any other Guardians refer to it as the American Ninja Warrior Course üòÇ
---
The S stands for sucks
---
Check your network connection. If your network is running slow you may have trouble with matchmaking.
---
I know it‚Äôs brilliant some of them these pair were awesome constantly avenging each other and the best bit is it was completely random as themuffinmans my brother 
---
It left me satisfied and smiling. 
---
Networks fine. All other games working great. All other devices have no problems.
---
His shots actually healed the enemy
---
Just take it as the usual quality control for games that use this type of pay-to-play dialogue. You were just adding to the realism. 
---
Lol this crucible body shot circle jerk has long lost my attention. You boys need to step up your crit game and learn how to Destiny
---
Any void and any hand cannon should work, most people use IKELOS hc because it's both and 180 rpm. Did you do them in quickplay? It goes faster in comp and iron banner.
---
Lmao, the right is everyone stopping when an invader arrives 
---

I‚Äôve gotten the triumph like a week ago and have gotten over 30 drops but not a single one has dropped üòÇ just my bad RNG
---
Tip: Give your sentry a shotgun
---
Sentry needs the same wall hacks invader does. Reaper needs the ability set down a stronger rift if a reaper kills all the wizards. And collector needs a vacum stysle perk so motes float to them.
---
Ding.
---
High five, I also got 2 exotics from dreaming city bounties today!
---
I would love to make orbs with Telesto, it's just so easy to multikill with it. Doing a raid is daunting to me though, as I never did one and don't really care for chatting with strangers. 
---
hmm... I'm not aware of any bugs in that part, so I don't know what's going on.
---
it would make strikes aggressively unfun instead of just boring
---
The funniest part is the credits at the bottom and thinking how people are going to find a way to steal it
---
I think you mean lord of memes
---
I have no problem with doing pvp for it just the grind is real and I decided to meme it.
---
Hate to break it to you but you didnt really carry
---
I have no clue how I would have made it through that quest if it wasn‚Äôt for my hunter‚Äôs enhanced tracking
---
I recently found out i have a lot of finest matterwaves and i just use those continuously in the hollowed lair nightfall. very quick enhancement cores.
---
r/suddenly gay
---
He removed edited the post and removed it after I commented lol
---
I got that step done in 2 days only on quick play with ace of spades and shield bashing my way into kills. It can be done. Reaching fable for the recluse on the other hand...
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I can help but only if you dont need these quests to do the strike cus i dont have either (completed thorn and dont care bout iza)
---
Absolute genius
---
I think you need to comprehend what I said. If the content is already there, it takes very little extra effort to create two paths. I'll say it one more time. If you don't like pvp, go kill X amount of enemies or do X amount of strikes. If you don't like pve go kill X amount of guardians in the crucible or complete X amount of crucible matches.
---
Like I stated before this is all content in the game.  I'm not asking for new locations or anything on that level. Not a big deal. It's not double.
---
Chose
---
A) strikes or
---
B) crucible
---
They both exist in the game. Either way you choose you end up a winner. 
---
I love these
---
I play on between 9 and 11 depending what the game. I use a taller stick on my elite but back on 360 I used kontrolfreeks.
---
Well me and a teammate, what ever same thing 
---
^betelgeuse
---
Regular gambit with original gambit gear malfeasance doesn‚Äôt count prime weapons and armor does not count.
---
If you have lots of world materials saved up use those and get heaps of Exotics and Legendaries.
---
Is it any good? I just picked it up today, using it with Oathkeepers is kinda fun
---
If you have the Annual Pass, the Drifter gives some 640 bounties. If not, just try to get all the ‚Äúpowerful gear‚Äù milestones done every week. 
---
For context- this was taken on my Hunter account, all campaigns finished and I've played Gambit prime, but for some reason can't access the bounties to get my power level to 640
---
My current power level is 607- am I missing something? Someone plz explain thank u v much in advance
---
Significant chance I might just be dumb
---
Elon love 
---
Elon see

Elon trust
---
My favorite thing in PvE right now for sure
---
I‚Äôd have to agree
---
If your struggling to get the pvp portion done play competitive and use the ikelos hand cannon, or the the kindled orchid. I‚Äôm not the greatest at pvp but I got mine done in 5 hrs or so.
---
Mine says annual pass active? I don‚Äôt have it my friend does on the same ps4 pro. So do I have it too? I have gambit prime on my play list too 
---
[me if that ever happens](https://i.imgur.com/QONVIyz.gif)
---
Damn cant get it  then, at least until they decide to do hat they did for d1
---
I finally got it btw. I used the ikelos hand cannon and the last word. I now have a burning hatred for the ikelos hc.
---
Does it really work that well? 
---
I actually do this sometimes If I'm running something like a bottom tree Sentinel Titan which is more suited for add clear than boss damage, figure it's more useful to get those Envoys down as quickly as possible in cases like that.
---
Most of the time, even when I hit someone dead on with a shoulder charge, it doesn‚Äôt kill them the way I would get killed by it. Sounds broke.
---
Also had an instance where I went head to head with a titan, both running shield. He held block the entire time while I was on his side bashing the life out of him. It never took one bit of health off. Then he bashed me as my super ran out. 
---
It‚Äôs pretty good lol
---
Im over 30 full clears and still none
---
Lasts a bit longer with the smoke vs knives though can get about 10 mountaintop shots off vs 4-5 on knives. 
---
Oh be careful what you wish for. It literally took me longer to do the strike than to get the crucible kills.
---
Bungie continues to put significant resources into refreshing Eververse each season, while failing to update most other vendors. I believe spends on Eververse encourages them to spend significant resources on lootbox 
---
Yes but gamblars dodge plus the middle gunslinger let's you have infinite melees because the burning gives you melee back
---
A good invader doesn‚Äôt have to camp afk at heavy spawn.
---
A good invader checks every time he comes back to bank and swings back around when it‚Äôs about time
---
At least they changed it from D1 so you don't lose progress on death. Yeah, it might take less-skilled players much longer, but at least eventually they'll get it.
---
I'm new to the game but I get the feeling that transmog isn't coming and most people have just accepted it by now.
---
It really seems odd that it's missing from the game because the collection system is so great. Maybe it's about trying to monetize eververse and get people buying silver for bright engrams to chase ornaments but it should be in the game for armor at least, weapons I think should be left alone. 
---
Also need a barber shop to change character appearance. 
---
Later comment stated the invader died instantly 
---
Destiny 2 purchases from Eververse are a waste of money because they won't transfer to Destiny 3
---
Change my mind
---
Just do it man, you'll love all the great exotic ornaments you'll get 
---
I stopped at 16% and decided to just do it in Iron Banner. 
---
Sword quests were worse lol
---
Sorry to let you know this but you're probably just bad with it. I shit on people with it. Its a 3 tap to the head in .53. That is the fastest ttk for a handcanon. On top of this adsing with it gives it a decent range, further than its intended. You should practice with it and eventually if you are a decent pvper you will start shredding. Its a disgusting gun dude. 
---
I love Jade Rabbit, and I know others do as well, it‚Äôs more of a PvP weapon, imo.
---
Invaders have over shield though. He clearly was very weak after the shot, just not dead. This just seems like a situation that you got outplayed in, and instead of learning from the experience you posted about it angrily on Reddit. I mean no disrespect and I‚Äôm sorry if it offends, but you just got outplayed in that particular situation. Nothing op, nothing busted or unfair. You just accidentally missed a headshot. Which was fair at the distance, no shame in missing. Just learn from your mistake and try to improve.
---
Yo i got a legendary helmet and nearly pissed myself 
---
Its you
---
An appropriate sniper to use in that clip. 
---
its simple guys. until the drifter says "That primeval is compromised" you stick to baby guns. when he says that, you ult and pull out the hammerhead
---
For a super that fast and with the buff it got it shouldnt have any damage reduction honestly

That's a struggle I would never want to shoulder.  I'm happy with PC only.

Yeah, PC was my main platform. Sadly all my friends got into it when it went F2P on PS4 and I switched to it then. I'm hoping we'll get cross saves, but I'm not optimistic about it as it's Bungie. 
---
Thanks mate. Will check it out. I'm from nz so often weird times for me
---
Thats a strain you shouldnt even put on yourself. Youll get burnt out easily and not wanna play anymore
---
fight forever guardian
---
give it the nova warp treatment ffs
---
That is a nice roll. You're looking at the ceiling every time you fire from that low stability but if you don't miss, you can get far away stuff just as deader as close stuff
---
I‚Äôm at 94% ;-; 
---
Yeah, I really only do PS4 now. I like this game, but I tried doing crucible for Thorn and it made me rage quit for the first time on forever cause I already had it on PS4 and it felt like a massive waste of time. So I can definetly understand the burnout part. 
---
Sad
---
I did Last Word/ Ikelos HC. Honestly one of the funnest times I had running two hand cannons lol
---
Same here
---
Do you have a 2nd person to help? Its easy enough to cheese if one person just hides behind the rock and is quick enough to kill a single witch thing. If you dont have a 2nd person I'm on ps4 as well and id be glad to help you out

I hate the new warlock solar super. It's really really good dont get me wrong but unless you happen to get a raid with 3+ warlocks your raid party will be very upset if your not using this just like rigs and nightstalker.
---
[removed]
---
Those are not the issue. The other braytech weapons are... oh auto rifle I wish I had you by now... then I could just focus grind the rocket launcher on nightfalls...
---
Sorry but no to all this. Honestly my team doesn‚Äôt mind if other team summons first because you can run a strategy of letting the other team summon and sending multiple blocker to make it harder for the other team and being good with invades means you can easily win why shouldn‚Äôt this be an option ? You can hold off on last banks when they summon drop a couple 15‚Äôs and a make that shit hard why should it be easy 
---
*hunters with literally any subclass*

I can't relate.

you had a 3 stack and a 4 stack join at the same time, see the player count jump straight to 8 and back out to avoid the 4 stack they thought they were playing leaving just you in the game. They really need to hide the player count until you get locked in this kinda thing is really bad for the game
---
You "response" shows that you are the villain in this story.
---
Ok.
---
Killin an enemy in the crucible = being a dick?
---
Most people thought pve nova warp was trash
---
Nothing wrong here. You hit exactly the head. What's the point?
---
Think I grinded out 25-30 frames over two days to finish that shitty step. Didn‚Äôt touch the forge again until last week for the power 
---
Two fucking bows

Still gets trash shaders from bright engrams
---
I dont have any friends who play Destiny ;-;
---
I think they do because not a lot of people use void it's either always arc or solar
---
I suppose it's possible to solo it, but I certainly wouldn't want to try it, hit up the discord or maybe [destinylfg.net](https://destinylfg.net) if you don't have clanmates or friends that can help.
---
No I'm lv max hunter but I have a titan lv 40 so after my hunters power is maximum, I'm going to  concertrate on leveling up my titan.

NANI?!

*Tourists*
---
I love how the audio changes in game when he‚Äôs calling you a snitch as you ready for transmat.
---
Matchmaking is still a bit wonky but gameplay mechanics are at a nice place imo. One eyed mask is still strong but not as oppressive as before, Titan skating is still fast but is no longer a bullet train, shotguns are still meta but the range nerf and buffs to other weapons means other weapons are viable. 
---
I wanna know more about mara and shaxx.

---
More often than I'd like. The game clock is infuriating, since even if it says 0:00 the game still hasn't ended until the score screen. That's like another 5 seconds where even if you "won" when the time runs out, the enemies can get some cheeky kills and tie or win the game. 
---
Invisible spectral blades got 5% more super armor then the other supers. You're using a 90rpm arnt you? Snipers in general never oneshot supers
---
Not to be stupid but how do you activate the cutscene it‚Äôs probably really obvious 
---
Bungoo doubled glory gain this season. It is literally half as difficult as 6 months ago.

It is not worth losing your sanity, if you are not having fun, don't bother.

I got my blast furnace with outlaw, rampage and range masterwork, my go to weapon, this thing shreds üëåüèª

Just food for thought. No particular reason for it

Can anyone help me I can't get the option to sift through the ashes is there a certain requirement?

It drops out of his butt after you kill him. There is something like a 5&gt;% chance of one dropping. Enjoy the grind, I know a guy with 50+ clears and does not have any of them, and I have about the same with 6 snipers and no smg or shotty... Welcome to hell.
---
The more you know. Thanks!
---
Naw you forgot the worst panic super of all time, Fists of Havoc
---
Tether? I hardly know her!
---
I agree, it has become like this. Second thing is that it's not healthy for the game at all (while convenient for the experienced individual on the short term).
---
Warlocks who have Sweet Business should pair it with Lunafaction Boots, then use your aura and the well of radiance to become an unstoppable bullet hose!
---
Not everybody wants to guide people through raids.
---
We've all had those days, just say "Sorry, my bad" in Team chat and do your best next round/game.
---
Yea, so based off of a lot of these comments, it seems as though there is a big difference between between PC and console LFG. Most of the time I just ask for "exp" for raid and it goes smoothly 99.9% of the time. From the looks of it though, I guess people lying about experience is more of a problem on console. 
---

Thought its like 1 confirmed for a kill. Oof that sucks. Thanks either way. Gonna go back to regular activities I assume

Chances are the 4 stack that you‚Äôre up against was a random group through a lfg site. You don‚Äôt need to be friends to play well with others. Mostly just good communication

Fuck Hunters.

Asking for 1 or 2 clears is reasonable but fuck the guys who ask for ‚Äúmust have at least 50 completions, done challenge mode, have this gun, have all these emblems‚Äù like bro I got a life outside this game lol
---
Nah, I'm 680. Getting direct hits. Spiked Grenades outrageous fortune. Used whole magazine to deal approximately 50% of the fallen sector boss hp.

No idea why we have such drastic difference in results.

Hunters in D1 had a teleporting one shot, and so did stormlock

Did, but nobody raised any stink about it.
---
Titan gets one and community flips shit
---
Spectral makes Crucible boring to play. I play Titan Devastator because I like to have fun and throw a hammer like an ape but some spoid with two knives teamwipes us twice with one super and I just stop playing. It's why I stick to Gambit Prime.
---
Want me to rock your crib a little?
---
Warlocks - In their D1 Sunsinger super, in D2 no melee but they do have Handheld Supernova which is a one shot grenade 
---
Hunters - The new exotic gauntlets, Liar‚Äôs Handshake. They do require you to be hit by a melee first though. 
---
thats a threat in comp only, in regular crucible he is useless.
---
No. It‚Äôs implied that he was a shadow of Yor, when the shady Hunter says ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt even use *his* name no more.‚Äù Plus Dredgen Yor had no ghost when Shin Malphur killed him, so unless Bungie retcons this fact, Yor is still very much dead by this point. 
---
‚ÄúA weapon to surpass metal gear‚Äù

I‚Äôm typing this as a remainder to pull a second one out of the collections when you‚Äôre 686 since it‚Äôll be 20 less than your max light

I see you using my Titan art

I have some in the postmaster from the rocks target event for vanilla destiny 2

I am also missing only geomags. Last night I was playing last wish hoping for a geomags, and I had 2 armor exotics with my warlock: lunafaction and skull of ahamkara. I got 2 exotics in the raid: lunafaction and skull of ahamkara. FML.
---
At this point I don't believe bungie reduced the chance of getting dupes, it's so frustrating.

This is the first time in my life I've even *touched* a drawing program so if it looks shitty that's why. If you know anything about pixel art i'd love some feedback. Thanks!

yes. I have 4K+ mats I don‚Äôt turn it because they are pointless. I‚Äôm just used to seeing the notifications though, because I usually have modulus reports in my postmaster, and etc...
---
Nope. After you go through the intro/tutorial you can play together. Race/class doesn't matter at all.
---
Had to been done you're welcome
---
You forgot to add Lava Floor Game and Purple Balls!
---
Haven‚Äôt heard from Fenchurch today
---
Congrats dude
---
And mod components.
---
Have you tried getting gud ? 
---
Use world line zero, kill might return ammo and it has a decently high amount in reserves
---
Race or class doesn't matter after the first two or three missons later you can play with your friends or randoms as much as you wish. And for race selection if you're like me and can't do shit to make a human look good go for an exo female exo's look amazing 
---
This. I had two friends that I got to try the game, first crucible match in quickplay against a 6 stack and we didnt even make it thru
---
First part just stand across the bridge up top and the enemies won‚Äôt follow. For the checkpoint just run straight to the elevator part. If you‚Äôre warlock then use stormcaller for the second elevator wave to clear the adds then just avoid the shielded baddies as best as possible. If you can get them all to run in the same direction it‚Äôs easier. This part was the hardest for me solo and the rest is easy. Use wish ender for the final boss and just cheese from the big rock in the back.

Black Armoury secret box. Got to shoot the little flying drones at each forge site to get the keys.

Interesting. This doesn‚Äôt look a like hunter with gwisim vest. Or max mobility hunter with stompee and dust rock blues with max range???
---
Thanks. 
---
Of course, that's why I said nothing *interesting* to do with the sub.
---
If I'm the only one they hit, I don't mind so much. 
---
gotta get people to play comp amirite?
---
Those numbers don't add up
---
I do, and it is higher than most but I miss d1 sword reserves 
---
Oh I still need to get the fourth key for that. 
---
I say get rid of cores entirely so we can have fun with the gear we want at any level 
---
Yup, same here. I can confirm I got 5 really fast kills, multiple times. Def bugged.
---
I think it's partly responsible or at least incidental with the taken-ing of the dreaming city and the whole inevitable end of the universe 3 week cycle thing
---
You know in the red war campaign after you take down the almighty, that cabal that puts his gun to Zavalas head and hawthorn shoots it, originally Zavala was supposed to die there.
---
i tend to leave a streamer if he uses either OEM or spectral blades. It's to booring to play and even more booring to watch
---
That's not hard to do thanks to the slow movespeed and aim assist.
---
I got it from Zavala leveling him up with tokens 
---
Ok
---
It‚Äôs a bit... small..?
---
Ah that makes sense, thanks everyone 
---
Awesome thanks :)
---
You see, if they turned Ward of Dawn into a normal ability you could use by holding your barricade, causing it to consume either your Grenade and Melee energy, or 25% of your Super energy along with your Barricade then I could see it being used as an actual protective ability like it should be used. But having it buff weapon damage doesn't make much sense and having it be a purely defensive Super ability makes no sense either.
---
Ward of Dawn should be a normal ability!
---
Agreed 
---
Meik seems more like a hunter to me with the knife hands

Intrinsic perk: burns extra investor money and gives employees burnouts.

huh did not know that, fortunately or unfortunately i haven't seen that yet. hopefully it'll be some guy on my team that does that one day
---
Wait where do we see these cutscenes?
---
Trials of the nine was removed to be reworked, and it won't be back for a long time. Invitations of the nine is, gameplay wise, totally unrelated to trials of the nine. It is a series of short quests you can get each week from Xur that will give you lore and a neat cutscene. 
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
I would like to know what it means please, I'm unfamiliar with the acronym 
---
the new exotic gauntlets for hunters called the liars handshake lets you one shot if you‚Äôve been hit first or something like that. 
---
Is it !
---
Because people in this game get mad when people are better than them but instead of realizing that it‚Äôs their own fault and they need to get better, they blame the other player because nothing is ever their own fault. 
---
y'know ever since you ratted on me I thought I wouldn't like you much, but I feel better every mote you bring back, haha!
---
yeah, but last word and ace are exotics, NF frees up your exotic slot for something else, like say the wardcliff
---
And I was felling suffocated for only having 400
---
Duke is a beast in PvP I love that gun 
---
My exact reaction when that happened not gonna lie. First time I hit a collateral. Didn‚Äôt know it was possible before then
---
Insight Terminus
---
I like this idea 
---
Maybe practice and get better?  It‚Äôs not a hard game to be good at. I don‚Äôt play a ton of crucible. Hell I just started playing comp for the first time this season and I still finish top of my team even though I‚Äôm with a bunch of Luna‚Äôs and DRB hunters and against the same stuff. It‚Äôs about map and game knowledge. My reactions are terrible but I know how to flank and when/how to push a weak player. Landing your shots is only half the battle. 
---
It's skill based match making.
---
you come into my house, and you hurt me like this. takes courage
---
Not saying that spectral and gwisin aren't OP, but OEM is still OP
---
Gwisin vest too
---
sorry to hear you feel that way :(

Brings me back to the good ol' days of kings fall.

Gambit Prime.
---
This used to be a massive problem for me. I read somewhere about getting an external SSD, which is a bit expensive but really increases how fast the game loads... I haven't run into a single load screen in this game on ps4 since. 
---
Just a drop at the end ?
---
And he only need 2-3 to get a large blocker. But I guess no blockers is better, right?
---
Im a titan, its kinda hard to go crazy with our supers if we dont have the right exotic
---
How long did that take to print?
---
I really love when random stuff like this happens in game. It makes me laugh and remember to enjoy and not take it as seriously for a minute. Thanks for sharing!
---
Everyone disliked that
---
If only you could do this in crucible to help your team out of a tether. 
---
Spoiler alert:  He ended up like a Star Trek Ensign. 
---
The whole thing took 8 days. 
---
I wish I got invites like that. I just end up getting mobbed in the Tower and stalked by already formed raids. It's been happening since D1 and it's creepy as hell &gt;\_&gt;
---
LMAO!!!! 
---
That would be pretty awesome tbh
---
Yes sir!
---
Ya the game modes are the worst part of comp. 
---
I mean each of the first 2/3 steps have you chose PvE OR PvP, the second to last is PVP, and the very last is PVE, isn‚Äôt that literally a perfect balance? 
---
NF out ranges TLW, Ace is good but a not forgotten user who lands head shots gets the kill faster than an Ace user who lands headshots
---
Yes
---
No it‚Äôs really not. Let me ask. In your ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù opinion, what would make it not OP?  Because they took away the instant health regen and the market doesn‚Äôt last as long either. 
---
Ahh, that might be it, I'll try that next
---
K. 
---
And it sorta locks you into using Contraverse Holds if you want to use it with any degree of regularity 
---
Bring it on!  What doesn't kill ya will make ya stronger!  Besides, the drama of a 4 vs 1 fight is great for audiences!  :D
---
no word from fenchurch
---
‚ÄúAre you handicap‚Äù. Yeah I‚Äôm gonna let that one speak for itself. 
---
You can see through walls. You get more armor than any other roaming super. You lose no energy from random swipes which also make you move faster. You‚Äôre invisible and off the radar which is huge since no one sees you coming around that corner. And you have an exotic that extends the duration of the super just for getting a kill.
---
I agree, sorry for being a douchebag. 
---
It's actually kind of odd to think about this, because that makes Thor the warlock...
---
? Do you not understand how Magnificient Howl works? It will virtually only matter if the LH/NF user has already gotten a kill, otherwise you get outgunned by a good AOS user. TLW isn't the relevant statement here btw, the sniper is. 
---
How does one have an unsuccessful raid?
---
Does the size really matters? HEHE
---
Wardcliff is barely used in high level play, it's replaced by Grenade Launchers, no clue why so many "pubstompers" use it in QP, I guess it's since people group up more? GLauncher would be just as cancer thought. 
---
U can just get it from random packages? Even before the set roll?
---
U can also jump and dodge it.
---
LW takes 30-40 minutes
---
valar devrimharis
---
then I‚Äôm just going to say that I‚Äôm probably awful and have bad luck for LFGs
---
That's great! Congratz! Read that it was your first time doing the pixel art, and its amazing (:
---
You gotta keep doing it to improve! :D
---
Can‚Äôt watch RN but is this the cheese where one fire team member hides and the other 2 slowly chip away at everything else??
---
If it is I‚Äôve just completed it. Took a while (30 min) and didn‚Äôt know what the other random was doing but it‚Äôs a great way to complete the quest. 
---
Probably 
---
Impossible. 
---
Pair it with dunemarchers and run around in pvp. It‚Äôs a blast 
---
The second i got one, my two go figures went in the trash. Haven‚Äôt used it in a minute. 
---
Don't know what you're doing but I recently got it after figuring it out.
---
It only drops from spider bounties. Best way is to buy every bounty that has the wanted enemy in the lost sectors. Pop a fireteam medallion and grind it out. I got mine in two weeks - 10 bounties.
---
Hahaha the downvotes. You‚Äôre all in fucking denial. Taken effects on our armour is a thing in D2. Fannies. 
---
A taken shader would be awesome and probably be the only shader everyone uses from that point on. 
---
SBMM Skill Based Match Making. CBMM Connection Based Match Making.
---
I was never a fan of go figure despite being the same archetype but I love my blast furnace and am fortunate enough to have a really good roll.
---
You get it from shaxx for getting crucible access 
---
I disagree.
---
It‚Äôs a waste of heavy ammo to take out basic mobs with a rocket launcher.
---
Neither do abbreviations if they aren‚Äôt common. 
---
Non-Casuals use top-line Void Titan.
---
OEM when super is down.
---
Hotswap to Doomfang when super is up.
---
I attract rage like a black hole attracts light.
---
Oh don‚Äôt get me wrong, I play on pc but for some reason I can‚Äôt use hand cannons for the life of me. So I just became a prick and use dust rock blues and graviton lance
---
I already made the outfit 
---
I get what you‚Äôre saying, but there are still vanilla weapons that are decent. Old Fashioned + Inaugural Adress is one combo I‚Äôve always liked. Especially the latter is still a strong gun!
---
Oh lol i just assume people play on console. I used to use graviton but now right side of wrong is my pvp pulse rifle lol. Maybe you just werent meant to use handcannons
---
*hey man*
---
Can you tell me what the legs and cloak are?
---
Scatterhorn legs and solstice cloak with rekindled ornament 
---
You don't need heavy ammo to get by unless you're playing a raid or escalation protocol. There are no bosses that can't be beaten with energy weapons and supers. Firing a pulse rifle into a group tether is so noobish you look like you just started playing yesterday.
---
I know what happens to Cayde
---
My thoughts exactly. 
---
still wouldn‚Äôt work on twilight garrison thoüòÇ
---
Dude, that‚Äôs spot on! Wouldn‚Äôt like to see that coming at me in quickplay üòÇ
---
Your power level is too low 
---
but you have to use a queens foilüòë
---
DUMMY THICC
---
Thanks dude 
---
Well you are going after a pvp exotic weapon it‚Äôs only fair for it to have steps based in the crucible.
---
Do you know the shaders aswell?
---
You're doing the lords work 
---
 I actually think the quest line was very inclusive, avoiding many of the annoying design decisions seen in the past.
---
The step you seem to be ranting about the most, Weaponize the Unknown, is considerably more generous than other quest lines from other seasons.
---
Instead of forcing you to use specific weapons or play in a specific game mode, you're incentivized to do so.
---
A year ago, you probably would be required to get handcannon precision kills or specific element in a competitive playlist if you want any progress at all.
---
Today, you'll get the quest done faster if you use a handcannon, get precision kills, use a specific element, or play competitive, but you are not required to do all of the above for progress.
---
Poor players aren't even penalized for death, as you cannot lose progress. Instead, good players are rewarded for playing well with handcannon streaks, eliminating a significant amount of the grind for the good players.
---
Why are they reworking it if you dont mind me asking. I always highly disliked it because I couldnt ever win a match for my life
---
Yea descendant vex chrome 
---
I got it from tier 3 reckoning,
---
*cough cough B L A D E  B A R R A G E 
---
Good point. I think we'd need the data to see if this would get more people into quick play and then weigh the salt of the nf/Lh user vs the increase in people playing crucible. 
---
Can we put a sparrow on the moon?
---
Are you on console? May be why. Otherwise idk. With well placed swords and the extended duration you get per kill plus the 2 second duration buff and the extremely high speeds you can gain by "dawnblade skating" its very common to get at like 5 kills in comp, wipe then 1 off the spawn. But if you managed to get some 2 for 1s with swords then you can get even more or if its a small map, and that doesn't require an exotic meanwhile the same thing for blades requires an exotic and in comp you can easily get focused or suppresse naded if playing a stack. Its definitely very strong but not too bad to counter if your in a team
---
It‚Äôs not as broken though 
---
*Eyy, another year! * It's your **4th Cakeday** T1mbaler! ^(hug)
---
Good job on 700, I posted pics of mine and a full guide about 2 days ago :). I‚Äôm also a titan main &lt;3
---
That is the great question 
---
I am also curious
---
No. Then that would make it an exotic with a pretty large draw back. Can you think of another exotic that hinders you?
---
That‚Äôs how I got my 3 I have I don‚Äôt even have the one he sells 
---
i waited for this thx
---
just dont want to buy destiny with all the dlc again for pc
---
It's my first forsaken exotic, it's pretty bad before the shotgun nerf/buff.
---
laugh in PC.
---
except in the case of gambit, its more like the turtle keeps sending one of its children back to bitchslap the rabbit; preventing them from getting anywhere:(
---
It might‚Äôve been iron banner, I don‚Äôt remember.
---
It's assumed that a Vex Mind known as Quria, that was Taken by Oryx but allowed to retain some of its free will and given as a gift to Savathun, has evolved to know how to convert things into Taken now as well. Although there's no solid proof one way or another yet.
---
I have another with ricochet rounds, moving target, and rampage.
---
666üòà
---
No you don‚Äôt lol
---
its ironbanner....
---
This is comp iron banner is 6v6
---
That sniper is the Bite of the Fox that Saladin sold with Moving Target and Snapshot Sights and the Calus shader (I cant remember the name)
---
e p c o t
---
I grinded Frumious cloak the first chance I got its the best looking cloak from year 1 IMO
---
it's not that bad tbh. I use the thorn and recluse and still get 30+ kills minimum.
---
Awww.... He deserves an award for being the cutest Gambit Prime participant!
---
Thanks man!
---
Quick play on ps4, but also control on titan. 
---
Man I was really enjoying the Thorn quest. I was able to play PVP and make efficient progress while having fun. Then I was surprised by dumb strike. Why does Bungie make me do strikes to complete a quest? They are not fun and I don't want to waste my time to learn the mechanics because I actually have a life. Ugh. Another poor design choice by Bungie! /s
---
NF is difficult. If you‚Äôre competent at comp you can get Luna
---
Why isn't he holding dust rock and nf
---
Bow with quick draw 110 hand cannon is a great combo.
---
No problem, that‚Äôs been my go-to crucible weapon since it was sold 
---
I swear I played with you yesterday, you kept on wiping out the whole team with dawn blade...
---
darn.
---
Thank you so much :) 
---
I'd like all of the class specific weapons to come back. I loved my Susanoo and the Titan shotgun was a staple for my build in D1.
---
Yeah, just go to it and if it is not active fast travel back to the landing spot and go to it again. Rinse and repeat and eventually you‚Äôll get one.
---
Maybe he's lonely...
---
I like Horror Story with the dark florescent shader on.
---
Titans=walls. Walls=cowards. Cowards=Titans. Titans=cowards. The math is right. I dare anyone to prove me wrong
---
I'll try that. Thanks so much :)
---
This is great
---
I‚Äôm new to the game and figured this out quickly. I don‚Äôt have the best armor and weapons. I leave the motes sometimes for the stronger players on my team. Nothing worse than have 6 or 7 motes and losing them
---
KORG!!! 
---
I have 900 and feel like I‚Äôm running out... used to have 2100
---
I liked grimoire...
---
I hope for the best in this hard times of yours,stay strong brother
---
Oh no. The neutral is fine. Just the super is a bit rough to use. 
---
Im not really that good of a crucible player, so for me getting kills is hard. Especially since im bad at using shotguns and refuse to take my Le Monarque off for anything. Kinda made this post to poke fun at the state of crucible, but also to show my frustration with the last word quest.
---
I really don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs all that great, I wish it was. I was all jazzed when I got it then took it right into comp kept getting my butt kicked by crimson, ikelios, and ace. 
---
As someone who uses banner shield I can say that I use it mostly to kill ads and generate health with the void detonators and use high sensitivity on a mouse to look like a fucking black hole and I can easily say the damage buff is not that high but I have had times where I have blocked enough damage to instantly get my super back. So if banner shield was nerfed heavily it would render sentinel middle tree useless.
---
More like Doomfang all the time, you get melee kills, you get a quarter of your super
---
When this is decrypted it will grant 2 expired tokens :) 
---
I WISH. I want to meet Bakendaddy soon...
---
I believe it's a weighted average so you'll also want to dismantle low light gear in vault.  Collections really helped gear hoarding out.
---
I can confirm the blueberry‚Äôs reaction
---
Walls = civilians safe
---
Titans on walls = Walls safe
---
Walls safe = Civilians safe
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 and a raid virgin too. I‚Äôm happy to be a fifth if you ever want one :)
---
We had ctf once idk why we can‚Äôt have it anymore but also, countdown isint that bad if the attacking team knows what they‚Äôre doing 
---
Yeah! And while they remove any pvp requirements from the game altogether, remove all the pvp ones too! It‚Äôs not fair that I can‚Äôt grind 10k crucible kills for my 1k voices or anarchy!
---
/s
---
I got 2 exotics yesterday!
---
Both were jade rabbits. 
---
Dumb luck, all I need is the arms and I've gotten boots from the last 4 polymers I've done 
---
It‚Äôs the result of a small puzzle within that area of the tower. There is a small ball located on the walkway above the spawn point. You take it to a specific location within the area, in turn, spawning another ball of a different color. You do this a few times, with a few different colored balls and a few drop off points and BOOM! Mega ball.
---
When you kick all the smaller balls to certain places there‚Äôs a fireworks show and that appears
---
Bro I‚Äôve run EP about 13 times now still no shotgun but I got the smgüëÄ
---
When you spawn and go up there is a ball (prob purple) just sitting there. When you kick it in the right place a new ball apears and you need to kick it in a different place and when you have done it enough times the big ball appears (doesn‚Äôt have any real use)  [Guide on how to spawn it](https://www.google.fi/amp/s/www.polygon.com/platform/amp/destiny-2-guide-walkthrough/2017/9/19/16333380/giant-ball-tower-kick-purple-green-black-blue-balls-goal-location-soccer-football-gray) 
---
It is one of the Traveler's testicles.
---
Ooof
---
Just when I got over that not existing... We really need that shell
---
I hope I understand this meme. I am new to Warlock. 
---
I don't have friends 
---
*got them both on my titan first LW*
---
What is that about, levelling them up?  Is there something more going on?  Cause I thought it was just giving him tokens (from doing their bounties) for loot. 
---
Is there more to it?
---
Talk to the Drifter as he has a set of bounties that can get you to 640 right off the bat. The are the very top set of bounties, each telling you which activity you have to do to complete the objective and what rewards they will offer you. All will reward 640 gear. From there you do each of your daily/weekly bounties for a Power Level increase. Rinse and repeat on all 3 characters each week.
---
All the idiot crucible fucbois with their "you don't have to do it" bro I payed for the game and I get the most enjoyment out of a game completing it. When half the content is locked behind a bunch of try hard sweaties running Luna's to gate average players it off that content, yeah I'm with op, it's stupid and bad.
---
I hate the style of PvP in Destiny (I am a faction based, open world, kind of PvPer...can't wait for Camelot Unchained).  That said, there are people who love the PvP.  I can't expect Bungie to not make content for them.  In fact, I would be decidedly disappointed with them if they did not.  One expansion of the Annual Pass is PvP oriented, I am sure we can look past that, no?
---
I wrote off a number of exotics and legendaries when I realized they require PvP, it isn't the end of the world.  
---
No one liked it, that's why they are reworking it. 
---
People have run it nearing triple digits with no drop. RNG is RNG. Took me about 50-60 runs.
---
I got it from my first bounty in october
---
Good luck!
---
Ha. Too funny. Link for the lazy:
---
https://db.destinytracker.com/d2/en/items/3488362707-phoenix-protocol
---
do it! its a fun challenge
---
Yeah but you can come back and finish a raid before reset
---
An ssd is the best. Espically on PC. Agh it's amazing. 
---
Console players think it is balanced, I however, disagree.
---
They also think LMG's are balanced.
---
and that hand cannons need recoil reduced lol
---
I'm a Titan and Cayde's mark is the only one I roll with also.
---
Yeah but then all the titans and warlocks would have to lose their Ace of spades
---
Only on consoles though. Coils are non-existent in PC crucible
---
Sounds like a market. Why don't you become the good news.
---
What gave it away ):
---
Nope bomb
---
now they do but before this week, everything was dropping +1
---
Thank you fellow Guardian with the encouraging word.
---
Still happens sometimes on my rig, despite m2 ssd. Sometimes even my framerate drops, idk what windows does. I could probably use the game optimization mode, but that makes my browser probably utterly slow. Struggles are real
---
I played Anthem and gave up on it.  Way too buggy.
---
The aim/aim-lock :P it‚Äôs okay though, you still rekt‚Äôd them
---
This and the thicc ass in the area where the portal spawns in the witch ritual in titan
---
Does the polymer drop the armor in place of a weapon? Or as well as? 
---
Turns out all the afk blueberries are just tripping acid instead of playing 
---
And? Pixel doesn't mean 10x10 as max size. You can have more pixels and it will still remain pixel art.
---
Hey! It's good to know there are others who have aternally cursed their accounts with a 666 Thorn! Congrats.
---
The blocker is not sent in such situation.
---
Beats that play exclusively Destiny music. I'd buy them in a heartbeat (No pun intended).
---
AKA add clearing without ammo. Has made strikes 50% shorter, love this combo
---
Try running full screen if you're running a windowed option, or it'll do that if you're playing videos or running apps on your other monitors while playing games. Could also just be a limitation on your GPU. Destiny might also just be poorly optimized for PC and if you're unlucky it'll just run at your other 2 monitors rates because frick you to hek. Happens to me all the time and I haven't figured a definite solution.

They doubled glory gain/loss in this season. You really should make a habit of reading patch notes and TWAB.
---
*bows down*
---
Amusing absence of proper aim and other players not killing you in one second.
---
Ooooh, yeah, I've gotten that in the reckoning a lot.  Freaking sucks.
---
Isn't the cheese possible still?
---
I'm sitting in a taco bell drive thru and my wife is hyperventilating laughing at that one
---
The first 1000 glory is super easy to get to, the matches will feel like regular Quickplay 
---
Try to queue with a 4 stack cause by the time you hit 1000 you‚Äôll probably have a 5 steak and a 4 stack will help keep the momentum going, any progress you make from there is huge and shouldn‚Äôt take you more than a day or so to finish it
---
Definitely down but I doubt I'll have anytime to play today
---
Gonna need venta black
---
Space hobos need love too üíö
---
Oh yeah , I saw something like that.  Idk though the way they changed it was if you had a 51% win rate you‚Äôd still be losing glory, but now at 51% you don‚Äôt have a deficit anymore 
---
right, like I'd consider myself pretty far from sweaty, but I put in a bunch of time and grinded comp to get the pinnacle weapons. Honestly I don't even like using luna's because my aim isn't good enough to consistently 3 tap. And the friend I play a lot of my games with has what can only be described as average stats has hit fabled for the pinnacle weapon in every season.
---
That said I love playing quickplay I can just run around and shoot stuff, also I don't have to care about wining or losing.  I could go play comp but I don't like 4v4 as much and I'd probably say countdown is my least favorite game type. 
---
Honestly dust rock is probably the easiest weapon in game to farm, of course it shows up a bunch in crucible.  And there's a bunch of good legendary kin/energy weapons so using the exotic in the heavy make sense,  wardcliff just works most of the time. 
---
If anything I'd say running in a large team is an issue,  and even there it's hard to quantify there's been a bunch of times where I've had a 4-5 stack on my team and still been the best player on the team.  Playing with your friends should be something that should be overall good for the game.  I guess that leaves the sweaty 6 stacks and I feel like I see those so in frequently that whatever, I'll just wait for the next game. 
---
I know right
---
Yeah I know I myself was playing pretty sloppy in this video.
---
But hey, that‚Äôs console Quickplay for ya lmao 
---
I was smiling and clapping at the end. Even got a little misty eyed. Well done. 
---
Hmm. Thanks man! I hope it goes well for me. 
---
Im so glad that d3 is confirmed. I can just rest easy, knowing there'll be destiny content for years to come 
---
[insert tincture post here]

Pull the trigger harder lol
