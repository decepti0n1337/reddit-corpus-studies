Also you can climb the tree near Ikora for some candy.
---
---
---
It should be a rare thing though or else it would be annoying. Isn't Quickfang the only weapon restricted (to hunters) or are there more ?
---
r/fireteams will hook you up
---
Spoiler tag is pointless if the spoiler is in the title
---
You can buy these with bright dust it costs 6k
---
Thanks for sharing.
---
Beautiful
---
I’m in so much pain because of this
---
Probably not a couple, maybe 3/4 hours I think. Played a bit of that freelance mode on Saturday night then wrapped it up last night. Was a good time :D
---
I'm calling hacks
---
Scoon poon
---
Interesting, I haven't gone to her yet...too busy with all the other bounties and the event lol.
---
Xur or RNG?
---
Sorry I'm really new. Can you explain?
---
Vibe check
---
To that point, I maxed back at Forsaken.... if it weren't for cross save, I might have never came back however nothing wrong with taking breaks from games.
---
Isn't the draw basically entirely PvE? I don't remember having any problems with it. It's stuff like precision finals blows in crucible that I have problems with.
---
They offer other items by earning them. Like the Auto Rifle.
---

---
Besides, bright dust is earned in game, technically it’s not behind a paywall.
---
Purchase season ranks?
---
Same
---
weird
---
The event is mainly about the masks, forest, and the new auto rifle. Yes the cosmetics are sick, I admit.
---
Yup, time to wait another like month or two for them to fix it again woo, it seems like other steps like the obsidian shard from the rare bounty also isn't giving progress. So all in all, they fixed one bug and created a bunch of others.
---
It’s very nice shaded
---
You absolutely can hit it in sync every time.  Test it out, when you get a feel for the weapon, you can fire it at exactly the same RoF as if it had full auto.
---
You have private matches, you can test this yourself.  People already have tested this as well and came to the same exact conclusions.
---
RNG is basically random drops.
---
Xur is a exotic vendor who shows up on Friday at reset time (1pm EST) and leaves on Tuesday ast reset.
---
you need to complete the quest from eris, then you can access it from orbit
---
Yeah when you go to seasons I saw purchase season rank for 100 silver now it’s mysteriously gone
---
No you still had to get kills in PvP with deaths setting you back. That was trivial though. It’s more the mission with the rather annoying mechanic.
---
I would have banned you too 😂
---
Oh, okay. Thanks!
---
Augmenting weapons is basically just picking a specific loot pool from some past activity that it allows you to and rolling weapons from that pool and they can roll with more perks to choose from. It does not allow you to reroll your already existing weapons AFAIK
---
They made it so the season pass is account bound. So we can only game share the expansions, not the pass.
---
Damn that’s amazing
---
Region chest
---
This guy gets it!
---
They were squeakers so definitely younger than 13. Had to turn my volume down to 5 for it to be bearable
---
It was accidentally activated today. They removed it as they did not intend to roll out that feature until later in the season.
---
Ok sorry for bothering people
---
But its breaking the games rules so as i see it.its fair play
---
Yeah idk how this hasn't got fixed. It's so broken. Only way you can lose with this is if your teammates are legit trash cans.
---
Okay so saying later in the season is that in the next few weeks or?
---
I love this a little too much
---
It’s only because the knockout buff keeps refreshing
---
They didn’t say yet
---
What’s the shader called?
---
Ah yes I forgot how difficult it was to understand the big red enemy repeatedly killing you after the announcer tell you he's coming.
---
Found this in the angry door section, as well as hidden on a cliff near Omar Agahs ghost in the new dungeon close to a giant worm skeleton, any theories, or translations would be appreciated ^^
---
It is with weapons of light
---
**Bungie:** We take concerns about cheaters very seriously. As a result we'll be nerfing fusion rifles and sidearms by 30%.
---
More like youre just a fucking entitled tool.
---
Probably the Bahamas
---
Totally not in a private match........
---
Oh lord. Im only 13 and wayy more calm than that.
---
Exactly
---
*nice*
---
Where is the badge for that broom ?
---
You’re not in a private match
---
Ok
---
If it kills, it kills
---
I main a hunter, but everytime I see a post like this is can't help but talk shit just because I'm so sick of them. Thing is, I never seem to have that much trouble with OEM titans. Just disengage until the over shield wears off. It's not that big of a deal to me. And you know what eles besides the mountaintop is a one shot kill? Every other single shot grenade launcher and a bunch of fusion rifles. I hate Jotunn in pvp more that MT, OEM and Recluse all combined.
---
This is what I like to see
---
I had a theory for this and I may be correct (I cant get any progression either but other people seem to sometimes). I think when they changed it to where you can get them from any forge, they may have forgot to change some stuff in the code. I think you are required to do the specific forge for each item for it to count now, cant really prove it though since i dont know which forges were for which items
---
So many fans I’d call that a crowd
---
And to damage the actual boss, you need to be standing in the green flames - remember to jump out when he sticks the sword in the ground.
---
If you stand on the stairs it says you can use a dance party key
---
Yep. Been plenty documented. Thank you.
---
Didn’t know man, didn’t need to leave a passive aggressive comment and down vote. Lol
---
don't know what this is, but I am crying with laughter.. literally wiping tears &lt;3
---
It's telling my I can only buy the mask with Strange Chocolate Coins but I can only collect them in the Forest - but I can't get into the Forest because I have no coins?
---
Somehow the button to buy season pass levels.. is that normal and did it happen to someone else?
---
Wait... People hate bottom tree sentinel now?!
---
Snitch
---
I’ve done this with the stretching emote, at the end they do a few hops and finger guns.
---
Spectral aids*
---
"calm down" is a really dumb thing to just say out of the blue. You're acting likee i'm angry, simply because i disagree with you.
---
I Did this event for the first time today. I found the invincible one-shot enemy with large aoe and the "haha you got caught so you don't get any reward" plain annoying. Asking why someone finds a plain annoying feature enjoyable is not unreasonble and so far the reason seems to be basically "because".
---
I miss the D1 tower when you'd see the lines of Guardians waiting to use the vaults
---
That’s cool af. Not gunna lie
---
There used to be a cheese but they patched it a while ago. It’s still pretty easy to farm and there are always groups up on LFG’s when the nightfall is up
---
Nice
---
Nova Warp + Jotun reporting in.
---
Consider me chemo therapy because sometimes you gotta take a little poison to kill the cancer. This may burn a bit...
---
Use destiny lfg.
---
Its been this way for as long as destiny has been around. We have all gotten used to it.
---
I got a message to restart after finishing an ordeal strike over an hour ago. Continued on doing another after restart and was all alone for 10 mins. Just logged off few minutes ago and all was working
---
Thanks for taking the time to clarify. Sorry for your luck, hope you find more positive experiences going forward.
---
Dude what’s your Outlast roll? Love that weapon.
---
Those are masks you need for the triumph, you need to buy the helmet. Row under the masks.
---
Just found out myself it was an unintentional release. It looks like they’re saving this for the last reset week of the season so got those who just simply don’t have time CAN buy out the season at least. I like this and I like it even more that they’re saving this for last second people.
---
Huh, you reminded me that I actually have that shotgun. Not good rolls on it though
---
Actually yeah
---
That is how it works. They changed it in forsaken
---
lol alright
---
NASA: Announce preparation to colonize the Moon.

---
Why would i buy something i didnt like?
---
No I'm aware. But my screen literally said 3 bounties when hovering over vanguard Strikes. Text was bugged or something.
---
Yeah,  thats a  great one... not to mention  that the Dungeon on dreaming city  will leave  soon apparently..  so  that will take  another lil month
---
PCs don't necessarily take a lot of money, what you did took a lot of money... But you can build a solid PC with what you spent on water-cooling gear.
---
Regular mystery grab bag gives you random blues while the epic gives you purples
---
I’ve always just used one
---
Well in case you think you can change the color. It's just a general warning
---
Cause its a new quest
---
Its available for bright dust isn't it?
---
It’s not bad at all. I don’t know what this guy’s on about.
---
Boop
---
They should just lock comp and if Trials ever comes back to people who have spent at least let’s say $25 on the game
---
Yes
---
Oh boy do I feel that, running an i5-6500 alongside a 1080...
---
Grow fat from ram guardian
---
You have to get the Masquerader's Cowl from Eva. Then, you can equip the masks in the appearance tab on it.
---
"Guardian, pick your head up. There is no time for sorrow, for there is GLORY to be won!"
---
I think you can find people with 3d printers thatd probably sell custom prints (assuming someones made suros 3d model already)
---
Alright I’m sorry
---
cool, didn’t know about the stairs didn’t see them
---
What the hell are those things
---
Do you want to know my loadout?
---
Punch resets my dodge, dodging resets my punch.
---
Punching increases my punch damage and heals me, dodging increases my punch range.
---
And anytime I am punched myself ot punch I can follow up with a super punch that also heals me.
---
Ohh, but theres more!  Any punch stuns the enemy, *and* dodging makes me invincible!
---
*And* melee kills increase my SMG damage 30%
---
“Consent is a myth.”
---
I feel like it would be easy if you timed the pre-teleportation phase and then timed the emote and substracted it from the overall time you have and just wait that amount of seconds/ 1/10 of seconds before you hit the key. Either way you'd need some good reflexes, so great job!
---
Is xenophage exclusive to the season pass?
---
You should post your own pic as proof
---
They reset. So you lose them. They probably won't even be there anymore and be completely different mods.
---
Pumpkin aproves
---
Google your local 3d print services, most services allow you to upload models you can often download for free.
---
As a fellow hunter main, when the titans arent being shit on, the hunters are being shit on. Just saying.
---
Although everyone shits on warlocks for their jump.
---
Its a shitty cycle.
---
^((written while shitting))
---
Dude i Dont.. I don’t know
---
My brother and I do this every gambit match and always give each other a hard time when we miss it. Lol
---
He is waiting for a fireteam xp booster... fireteam...
---
Do it again!! Do it again!! This really got me, I lol'd way too much!
---
Yeah, I got mine today.
---
Not sure the order in which they apply, however, the modifiers are as follows: Blackout, Glass, Grounded, and Attrition.
---
**Blackout** - No radar and enemy melee attacks deal more damage.
---
**Glass** - Health and shields are reduced by half, but recover twice as fast.
---
**Grounded** - Enemy attacks deal more damage if you are airborne.
---
**Attrition** - Shields regenerate extremely slowly, but picking up a well of light begins regen.
---
Run from the giant knight. You cant kill him. Glass is you take more damage but you regen faster I believe
---
All my symbols are in Japansese for some reason, everyone else has emojis for them
---
neither worked unfortunately. and it doesnt look like the ervers are down.
---

---
More than a light Shank.
---
We lost DFT, but we got you.
---
A soul for a soul.
---
I've found that pluperfect is really good. Like a 4 shot body shot at the most
---
I love the ornament but the only thing that bugs me is using an exotic armor piece cuz it just ruins the whole look of it :/
---
the issue is, I used one and try to farm another one and it won't show up in my inventory
---
Yup. Come and leave as you please. We aren't really crazy on anything. I'm deconfig on steam let me know if you need help with anything, we have a discord.
---
It stills says that I can get an exotic from the nightfall though. Can I actually not and it's still just telling me the rewards?
---
INFO, NEW FORGE KEYS WILL NOT COUNT AS PROGRESS, AND OBSIDIAN  CRYSTAL WILL NOT WORK EITHER!.
---
For slug shotguns opening shot adds another meter and helps you get headshots a lot easier. Again, there's no point maxing range as it's capped at 12m which doesn't require 100 range.
---
Is this an actual place in the game? If so where is it?
---
Your first 5 levels every week are easier to get
---
I'm going to use a scombine to clear all of scorn from myscornfield
---
Depends on the vintage.
---
Yay
---
where’s that emote from
---
Except on bosses who have 2 crit spots like clays lowers overall dps doesn’t it?
---
Well, I can tell you from experience. It happens.
---
Destiny 2 raids don't require 400 IQ, let alone 100 for that matter. Thanks for the compliment, I guess?
---
.... You died... Doesn't meant you were at the end.
---
I don't know what it's used for, but did you also get a mysterious "quest mission available" when you used it? I did and I can't find said quest mission. I'm not sure if that was just a completely unrelated coincidence or not.
---
Nobody reeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
You can find it inside the ramen stall at the Tower, it's on the inside wall. It's almost directly behind Ikora, and there are stools in front of it as well as a blue and red sign on the wall with the picture of noodles.
---
Hunters be like: StRiKeR tItAnS oP
---
Theres at no point any downside to divinity. Crits count as crits no matter what and get crit damage + 30% damage. Body crits are just body damage +30% but proc crit perks.
---
Nah I'm having a good time unlike you
---
They timed the final key press of the emote to the teleportation.
---
I respect it
---
Didn’t realize doing the weekly gave some. Must’ve not been looking
---
Ok my bad could’ve swore I saw a post that said it did sorry!
---
All good things must come to an end
---
Who's your daddy?
---
Do you think people will upvote just a bow? I have a 12 kills in 2 minutes clip, but none of the kills are particularly impressive aside from them being bow kills. Do you think people would find that kind of thing cool?
---
You can also access the forest directly from the destination tab -&gt; Tower -&gt; Forest
---
Gonna be honest, was kinda thinking of a shaxx expansion too and what you just said, sounds amazing. To bad bungo probs won’t do it. But I guess we can dream
---
You pick the mask up from Eva and then it'll be in your helmet slot
---
That will be one awkward season
---
Rip, want it supposed to be fixed today
---
Wasnt
---
I didn't try with mountaintop for the continuous reload but it definitely still reloads my love and death
---
So... should we help him or kill him?
---
Eh, i can understand them to an extent. I feel pretty bad when OEM fucks me over sometimes. 
---
My KDA is okay, around 2.0-3.0 per game. But sometimes against OEM theres no winning and that can tilt me. I can deal with everything OEM does except wallhacks. Havent found a proper way to deal with it yet, so i can still understand the frustration.
---
I don’t believe its a bug, it is an explosion weapon. That means not critical and a snipe will always hit more than an lmg
---
Corvus Corax is that you?
---
Wait seriously?
---
Can we get some up votes on this I just want the right people to see it
---
Time to enter the Matrix
---
Thiccc with three Cs
---
nice
---
Damn feels bad man
---
Idk why everyone hides it’s so easy to overpower an invader unless they ult. Just look for where they are and snipe them!!
---
Guess ill keep waiting until i can buy it with bright dust
---
Earlier today I got matched with two people who kept trying to kill the enormous Hive knight.
---
3 weeks
---
First guy was a titan like 6 months ago, this is the second one I think
---
Balance is key young hunter the best hunters know how to use all 3 to their fullest extent... but yes I do enjoy a going on a rampage as a pole dancer
---
What is happening? I dont see anything happening.
---
I recommend momentum while it's out. 1 shot headshot kills with high impact scouts.
---
Same problem, knowing Bungie this won't be fixed for at least a week so I'm just going to hold onto the key until I get patch notes saying it's fixed.
---
Getting cross-mapped-one-tapped by 150 scouts isn’t fun but doing sure as hell is.
---
Is this available to use all the time, forever, or only during these events?
---
Happy cake day
---
Yep, I find it really hard to grind for anything after an 8 hour long work day. Too exhausting
---
You cant as of right now. You can only buy to have your character raise to 900 power
---
i love how you can wear a mask without it destroying your light level now
---
If you had access before it was a mistake, bungie had mentioned before that buying season pass levels will be something only avaliable at the end of the season for those who couldn't quite make it. It was purposely left out in the beginning so everything felt earnt
---
you still have to grind, they more weekly to complete so yes, and maybe more in upcoming content, just do all weekly get those powerfull
---
Oh man. I might have to give up my Ghaul Phoenix resurrection
---
Me with school work is rank 68 meanwhile there are already people managing rank 400
---
How about now?
---
Is nobody going to talk about exodus pink? 
---
Oh wait I am only the second comment.
---
No. I played like 1/2 of the first mission in a trial year 1.
---
Noice
---
You can also climb the tree in the Bazaar for similar rewards :)
---
Cuz Halo possibly.
---
thats fcukin AWESOME
---
1. to get candy you should be wearing the mask thingy you get from the event vendor. enemies drop candy no matter who kills them.
---
2. to kill you. no seriously, he's there just to kill you afaik.
---
3. It's a trap. there's a hole in the wall that lets you escape the death trap or you can just fly over the bridge as warlock.
---
4. Public events and challenging enemies (yellow health bar) drop chocolate strange coins when you beat them. Strikes might drop them too but I'm not 100% sure about that.
---
#UNITED STATES OF SMAAAAASH#
---
Right? He makes me feel like I've got the big artistic dumb
---
 n i c e
---
Get controversy hold. You'll be the one shotting now XD
---
How is this obtained? Random drop blues don't look anything like this for me.
---
r/transmatfiring
---
Flaming Maul gang rise up
---
Is it
---
Below 900 pretty much anything works. If you're trying to be as efficient as possible on your first character, grab a powerful reward, see if you can milk some extra power off blue drops and then grab another powerful reward. If it's your second or third character just move over your highest guns and then claim rewards from Zavala or Shaxx to climb to 900 and do the same from there.
---
If so i wanna be a minotaur that stomps on people
---
Seen the Fanatic lately?
---
No one here I gonna judge you for excessive play I have 275 hours of shadowkeep so far
---
Nah, it’s in the basement a little past Ikora
---
I want that harpy !
---
uhm, can't sign that
---
the redrix you get from shaxx upon completion if the quest, is not the "god roll" neither for pvp nor for pve.
---
same with curated roll of weapons from scourge or gambit prime for example.
---
But do they?
---
Is it just me or they more common? I haven’t had a cabal in a long time
---
Ouch
---
Someone is preparing for the vex invasion through Ikora's portal.
---
don't be. it's what he would have done.
---
This happens to me but with certain players, very annoying
---
This is now my pc background thank you
---
Wait wha.. what did u do to those pore guardians
---
How do you even get the actual gun to start off, I am confused on how to get it
---
I think so :(
---
It’s a 6 person activity with various phases and encounters. Each encounter has difference mechanics (so it’s not just about killing things, you may have to do other steps or kill things in a particular way). 
---
You can find other people to do the raid with in various discord communities, using the bungie app to find a fireteam or the subreddit r/fireteams. There are also guided games options but I’ve heard it takes a long time to match make if you are a seeker.
---
I would suggest having at least one experienced person with you that can explain the encounters well. Also a microphone for all team members is important so you can communicate to each other.
---
At least we can escape the pit :)
---
If you want fast cooldowns, then you are looking for armor with high stats like Discipline, Intellect
---
You need the Triumph for buying all the masks she has to offer this year. So it's a grind for chocolate strange coins
---
It's 3 weeks long
---
The Festival of the Lost ends on November 19
---
That’s it? I thought you had to have the actual gun before the fact.
---
Middle of the pit on right - exit 🙂
---
Nice.
---
Just jump to the save middle part and then jump to the chest.
---
I never thought I'd say that about the crucible, but momentum control is awesome!
---
You could say that I...controlled their momentum. Amiright?
---
Hey I’ll play with you on PC ✌️
---
That's how you acquire the masterwork and original then for 250 candy can chance to re roll a new one 10 power below your current
---
I'm confused why you bringing an outer world's quote into this XD
---
having fun
---
You dont get exotics from stories anymore, and as far as i know, nothing tell you there even is a story
---
just like halo SWAT
---
Once per week, per character only.
---
Now make it ripped like the hulk holding the gun for amusement. after the hard work you put into that masterpiece I only feel hungry for you to do more
---
I didnt see anything. I was looking around in my warlock and randomly found them
---
Tell me this where can I find this t pose emote
---
No, only armour
---
You can try to run your Riskrunner with Geomag Stabilizers and middle tree chaos reach build. It has insane single target DPS, and geomag boots prolongs your chaos reach duration. I probably will try this also as I got these boot last week from Xur, but didn't try that build yet.
---
https://i.redd.it/zal2rno7bru31.jpg
---
I’m sorry good titans will literally just die unless it’s a last minute survival. Then wreck you next round
---
You can get a bunch of old emotes and cosmetics thanks to engrams that you can open at eververse, they have pretty much just stuff from all past seasons, but obviously not all of it
---
How much are we betting the vex use the portal against us and invade the tower
---
First I've heard of it though, so thanks!
---
This was already posted before, i saw it like 2 hours ago, it's not funny, stop reposting.
---
That's my current build actually just using pulse nades instead of the typical bolts 
---
I enjoy it, but I want my flexibility back, hence the post 
---
If I run that combo, I don't want to feel gimped anywhere else 
---
Plus I want to try some wackier stuff too like the gloves that turn grenades isn't arcsouls
---
&gt; i think i have 24 hours in a week (If someone asks. our university had some free days at the moment, so i was able to inmerse myself in this) 
---
oh sweet summer child
---
rip xD
---
Don’t worry that unbroken on your team will carry
---
To my knowledge, no.
---
Haha, that was awesome.
---
especially b4 the shot firea and you know your a dead man and you ain't gettin revived hahahhaga
---
Only need 450 scout rifle kills. After that, get about 70 cold fusion medals and that'll bring you from 0-100%.
---
dude thats insane nice work!
---
[You go to hell! You go to hell and you die!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIMrFpnfvyI)
---
The one thing I miss from base game
---
Well done man 👍
---
Failsafe, you are both depressing and unhelpful
---
No matter how many times I go back to the statues and get the confirmation that I've emerged from darkness the next step never drops from the chest.
---
Omae wa mo shinderu!
---
thx
---
Where's the Crit spot
---
Season Pass Chestpiece Ornament.
---
What power level was your pinnacle drop?  What piece did you get?
---
Thanks :)
---
Shipping outside of the US I kinda expensive sadly :|
---
U will be in our harts cade
---
Agree, one of the best modes i played so far
---
Restart your game?
---
Yes sir
---
I often wait for my Fireteam members to 100% the level.
---
JFC, if you're too lazy to do a proper screen cap, at the very *least* orient your photo the correct way.
---
Thanks, so what's the next step after that?
---
It's called a joke, but ok.
---
Just trying. I'm heading back to the statues now.
---
Whaaaaa which dunjon?
---
There's a couple comments by Calus regarding humanity and the vex that got me curious.
---
He implies in one comment that the vex aren't actually attacking us with warrior class vex yet for some reason. 
---
In another comment states that out of every species to face the vex, only humanity have stood a chance against them so far.
---
This could be intentional from the vex. If the traveller really is vex in origin then because, presumably, it has a purpose for us planned out already the vex aren't actually coming at us in full force. It might be like some form of cattle rearing.
---
Man that year 3 D1 vault armor set looks great, really loved Crota’s end a little more tbh
---
I'm pretty sure the pictures are static though, right? so i think it would cause a lot of tedious work whenever a new shader is added or new armor pieces.
---
Only destiny
---
This is a joke, and Failsafe is just trying their best ok D: And I actually love Failsafe as a character.
---
Actually it would help avoid it, by automatically generating the icon *for them* making it less work
---
I *try* to continue. But often just take too many shortcuts and die again....
---
Didn't work
---
Now it needs a rice cake to nibble on
---
Lmao this setup is literally hunter lol OP salty as hell because they suck haha!
---
Yea mine was a quote from ghost when failsafe called cayde dumb.
---
Just change your name to "Goblin" and people might shoot you by mistake.
---
Last night other 2 in my team decided to take the path close to the cliff on Nessus map to flank so basically they mad me hold solo vs 3 people on heavy. Didnt end well.
---
Oh, I just feel stupid now! I remember that.
---
Really? They work for me
---
Yeah. Thank you.
---
This is great and all, but how did you take a selfie? Is it an emote? I need answers
---
That's Artichoke-17 for you
---
I thought you only had to buy the 5 masks?
---
Middle Stick Best Stick.
---
Woops
---
Orewing's maul uses green ammo, so you only get two shots at spawn, and I'm terrible at aiming grenade launchers. Fighting lion at least uses white ammo.
---
Seaaon 8 lvl 22, what.
---
Is there any special reward/triumph/whatever for finishing?
---
the event on the moon drops crazy amounts of candy and coins, i got about 700 candies in about 30 mins
---
Jade Rabbit? More like Babe Rabbit... am-I-right?!
---
Kidding not kidding. That’s dope.
---
I've been playing Titan lately too, just to test it in pvp, and yes, I will admit OEM is OP. The devs are watching it currently, so there's a possibility of a Nerf. I've personally been running Synthoceps (I got them from Xûr) in pvp. I pair it with the middle tree arc subclass. The buff from Synthoceps makes taking points a breeze if there's at least three people on it. But hunters can be pretty strong too, and so can warlocks. Hell, Hunters get some of the best Ults I've used, personally. But warlocks, Titans, and hunters are pretty balanced imo. It's just the different builds and OEM that make Titans seem OP.
---
Not exactly... Auryx became Oryx, but it is not in a sense that we usually see these days.
---
Aurash became Auryx. She took the worm of the King Morph, and then became King. She did not became Queen, she became King, however, if I understand how the Hive society works correctly, this is just a "title", it means that Auryx was the ruler, not that she became a he.
---
Auryx then became Oryx. She took the power from the worm god, communed with the darkness and now her Kingdom was not given to her, it was taken by her. She became the Taken King. She did not became the Taken Queen, she became the Taken King, however the important thing here is that she now have her power not by the "benevolence" of the worm gods, but because she took her power, and King, again, means "supreme ruler" not "male figure that rules".
---
So, to me, Hive is just a society that transcended the concepts of gender in favor of roles, and each and every one of them is defined by what they do for the Kingdom, and not by anything else, thus, those definitions of male and female are just for our amusement.
---
Auryx and Oryx however, did not have humanoid female body structures, so one could say that they were male in physiology, but that is the full extent of the validity of the argument that Aurash was female and Auryx and Oryx were male.
---
It's gonna take a long time to grind them out, methinks. I'm not playing all day everyday but so far I'm at level 15 I think. But I just got a 10%xp ghost so maybe that will help a little.
---
gambit also grant bright dust?
---
The only true sci-fi. I see you are a man of culture as well.
---
So if they add a new Weapon, they don't need to go through the process of making an icon for it. It's automatically done. It may add more work now but less work later, also it would be much better as we would see the icon as our Weapon with the shader we currently have attached to it
---
Give those guardians riskrunners. We will chain lighting them to kingdom come.
---
But... a siege of hive wizards really scares me.
---
#A R T I C H O K E
---
Gross Imperfection Achieved.
---
Holy shit thank you so much my dude!!
---
I need this template so bad.
---
Don’t let primes stack up! They won’t increase in light if you level up before opening them.
---
yes, a youtuber killed the franchise. sure dude
---
As it should be
---
Yea I decrypted em, thanks for tip
---
I thought it did when I did it, could be wrong though
---
Need the campaign againt
---
If you made 3 of the same character only one of them gets powerfuls per week.
---
LETTICHOKE
---
I dont think you need to redo the whole campaign but I think you have to do the introduction challenges for what you want to do challenges for
---
2 more what? Warlocks? Your powerful drops are class specific you won't get powerful rewards at all on 2 of them.
---
If you made a hunter and a titan you can transfer weapons between classes to raise light level but not armor.
---
Shit, I didn't know that. Been a while since I played Gambit.
---
Wait what?? I really hope this is not true.
---
I am doing it with teams and i never get beyond 6 or 7
---
That armour is really cool. Can you apply shaders to the mask?
---
Yeah, you can hover on top of the bounty to see ***the potential rewards***, It's the first two bounties on the left.
---
killing a dawn blade or GS with the spin releases all the happy chemicals.
---
It's very true.
---
I am a blueberry too but most of the time I have most kills so yeah
---
Only last for the festival, but thats just to balance people wearing mask year round
---
How in Oblivion do you do this?! I wanna get stronger! 😂
---
The vex event?
---
Ahhh.. interesting. So it basically FORCES you to have 1 of each class?
---
ah ill check that out, thankyou for answer :))
---
Why are you using vigilance wing in Gambit lmao
---
Any particular strats you would recommend? I've noticed that getting 1 person to run to open next area as soon as it's unlocked might speed it up a bit, sword ammo and supers saved for Terrors(?)/MiniBosses.. any other?
---
Not at all. Plenty of people only play 1 class, it just doesn't allow you to power grind 1 class by having triple powerful rewards every week.
---
Something...
---
ANYTHING!!
---
r/mod rule #15?
---
Ah okay thanks, I did look online but couldn't find anything about it
---
Does it complete the “Fallen Council” requirement for the Specific Moon nightmare hunt triumph?
---
what’s the sniper?
---
InB4 banned from sub
---
Dont be sorry. This is a fookin masterpiece.
---
No, those guys show up in archer's line, don't know if they're here this week
---
No, the fallen council is the nightmare group that spawns in Archers Line
---
Yeah I do hope you get banned
---
Was that last week?
---
Lol
---
i sided with the vanguard
---
it doesn't work in contracts, only in quests
---
i can see this dude running at me with an over sheild and a dust rock blues
---
The Mida multitool is literally useless
---
They'll definitely get around to it...once they find a way to add purchasable bag-slot upgrades to the Eververse that works with their cloud-based inventory API.
---
But in all seriousness, they need to work on their abysmal quest interface first since they've started thrusting more and more stuff in that direction presumably to relieve the mind-boggling number of TIERED, separately-stacked consumables. Even cool stuff like the Menagerie chalice system (independent, account-wide inventory) is bogged down because it's just lost in the pile of ritual, locational, and exotic weapons, seasonal quests, story quest, etc etc all crammed into a single menu for some reason. I guess the reason is "console" but still.
---
Who is taking care of him.
---
Tyrant shell. Rasputin is known as the tyrant in some lore cards.
---
Hush is a phenomenal bow for crucible it just doesn't feel right to me, le monarque is well worth it though. It used to be a random drop, is it a quest line now?
---
Code a crazy Code Lyoko vibe here.........don't know how i feel about it lol
---
FYI, if you are using sarcasm, I have been told you MUST put "/s" at the end of your comment/post. I learned this because I too made a joke that reeeeeally pissed some people off. The more you know.
---
Now that's just mod abuse, you should report em
---
The quote is from Skyrim, the pic is from the new cutscene that should play on login after the last reset.
---
Yea ive done this doesnt help its all new to me also.
---
It was mentioned and it has been fixed
---
Erentil time
---
Just take the path that doesn't fall out below you.
---
One of my friends have over 500k kills on this shit
---
Its the Masquerader's Helm with the Shaxx mask ornament from the haunted forest with the Mimetic Savior Gauntlets, Phoenix Strife Type 0, Sunbreak Greaves and The Prodigal Mark all with the Cinderchar shader apart from the mark which has the green rarity shader, Maroon Moon, on it.
---
going to attempt getting a stability masterwork on my erintil. wish me luck
---
Im interested ;)
---
Nah, he had the right to take it down *somewhat* but I just found this funny
---
This was my conclusion after almost 10 failed runs. In the last run I died, and I noticed that they didn't really seem to be killing stuff. So when I respawned I checked the counter. They did 20% progression in 2 minutes. I had twice the kill of one, and thrice the kill of the other. After that I did 2 runs with clanmates and completed it. I think the best shot is finding like-minded people in the LFG Discord and doing a couple of runs together.
---
Dude... Just want until you need mountaintop. I played 7h straight last night to get launcher multikills and almost cried when I got it.
---
Spacers choice!
---
He is slowly developing a beer belly.
---
It's not really sarcasm, just a joke. Sarcasm is pretty Different, and yeah I know that dOiNg tHiS iS aLsO aCcEoTaBlE for sarcasm
---
That was my experience, once a team it took 2 runs to get it done.
---
He would be a great basketball player.
---
As soon as I got the mask I knew what I had to do.
---
I think you can't play the raids without Forsaken
---
“Father, I thirst for violence”
---
We would need that if we even had a reason to go there in the first place.
---
Yeah
---
Fuck me, that super timing was *tongue smack* N O I C E
---
Give him a tiny Cayde mask to wear.
---
She gives me serious Granny Goodness vibes from superman
---
Wait really?
---
I didn‘t know they were gone oof.
---
Sorry for destroying your hopes rip.
---
I think the only thing I have left then is his ramen coupon and journals
---
Hunters are head and shoulders the best k/d ratio class in the game, they’re op as fuck
---
Probably because WW is a damn good AR. Rerollable version sounds wonderful.
---
It seems very gear sensitive. I think LMGs in heavy are just about a must, having that iziiziieguie sniper meta is also very good for bosses. That was the setup we did and completed it. I think Bungie may have made it a little too hard for the average player. 18 minute timer or so would help most I believe.
---
I kept the ramen coupon and a spinfoil hat, nice little mementos
---
Maybe it was just a recreation. I'd really like it if he would've given credit for the inspiration, especially since the title was completely stolen from the original.
---
I’ll pass getting shot in the face by jade rabbit from across the map is a one shot lul.
---
Not really, your allowed to make an argument if something is unbalanced, they're just an arse.
---
*small violin plays*
---
Asher mir looks fuckin ripped
---
Now i need to know how many tries
---
You flatter me
---
Or just putting them out of their misery?
---
Just imagine him ducking the ball while his fist are made of pure arc
---
I personally find the default Winter Wolf stuff fits perfectly for what I need it to do, could use a faster fire rate. But beside that it pairs perfectly with Riskrunner
---
I'd say LMGs and the izigugia sniper. I went with the mod on the helmet that "increases all damage against enemies". I had elite at first but having the previous mentioned allows me to 1 tap 98% of the enemies with my Thunderlord. I also think that it is good to have one guy running and gunning getting ahead as quickly as possible if the instance allows for it. In some cases the doors are locked.
---
Apparently it's still bugged. I think now you can get the key or the obsidian crystal but it doesn't progress the quest.
---
Source. A quick Google and scan over the destiny forum.
---
Don’t go on yet, the quest is even more broken now. Multiple steps are broken I think
---
I think you should be banned for suggesting this guy gets banned for having a complaint
---
How do I do this?
---
*dunking
---
*hey look ma I made it.* If one is to quote Panic! At The Disco, one must quote it correctly.
---
Happy boi
---
For something that happened like 3000 years ago?
---
Hell no.
---
1. It would barely run
---
2.Thats just a terrible idea
---
I really don’t want destiny to turn into another Fortnite
---
I ran out of space in my consumables recently, so I just dismantled it.
---
That is true. I had to look up the shotgun in the D2 weapons database to actually get it.
---
And yes, bungie has a database for all its D2 weapons. [https://destinytracker.com/destiny-2/db/items/weapon](https://destinytracker.com/destiny-2/db/items/weapon)
---
Haven't played the game (yet, still not sure if I pick this game up).
---
Anyone who will/can explain it to me?
---
I use Well for team activities. Just so you know. And I don't use Mountaintop or Recluse in Crucible. I've been very nice.
---
Always new people joining the Subreddit
---
That is the dumbest shit ever. Only on Reddit do you see people constantly announcing their comments are sarcasm/a joke because they’re afraid of internet strangers getting upset or downvoting. Has this site always been this cringy?
---
does the colour of the skeleton change with shaders or is it permanently red?
---
I did the same thing to farm golden coins last night. On the moon it 1 shot everything in the fallen warsat PE including Shriekers, but on mars fallen warsat shriekers it took 3-4 shots
---
The Destiny community on Reddit has no understanding of the concepts of jokes.
---
I’ve gotten downvoted multiple times for making jokes and people taking them seriously.
---
Well then ill make sure to put a little green tick next to your name so you get extra good loot.
---
There's been like 12 billion posts....
---
That is actually my face when I have Skullfort on in crucible. Nothing more satisfying then shoulder smashing someone as they’re shooting at you
---
A bit random but ok
---
I run this and it’s nasty, I use the ikora vex hand cannon with demolitionist, 2 kills and 2 seconds and I get grenade back
---
How they can even put the quest for this useless weapon?
---
Also it's not the morning for everyone
---
Well yeah same, I not the best either nor the worst and I've been playing destiny a lot lately. Never noticed difficulty while being on the same power level. 
---
Also, whenever you're in an activity that equals out on your power level, it equals out to your combined PL, not the base one. So I'm even more convinced it's the combined that matters. 
---
Maybe you read the PL of the dungeon wrong...?
---
At the same time, I've never played a dungeon, so it might be dungeon specific.
---
He appears really, really, really, really thrilled to meet you.
---
I've been better... joking helps.
---
  Inaccurate! I have never been confounded in my life .
---
This has been posted a lot, just saying
---
Need team though ?
---
This isn't even the official subreddit dude....
---
I love this. You need all the upvotes.
---
I don't get this, care to explain? Still new to Destiny in general.
---
adding "no one:" in this context makes no sense change my mind
---
😂 thanks
---
You can buy all the festival of the lost gear with just 36,000 bright dust, so you really just need to do all the weekly bounties, plus 3200 additional bounties, which will just cost around 7,000,000 glimmer to get, and you can get that glimmer for only 7000 shards from spider. Easy.
---
I've seen the randomized rolls being pretty bad. The curated masterwork roll is decent. I got the curated last night and it's not bad, though I'm not a fan of auto rifles normally.
---
This entire post is about Cayde being dead, he knows
---
It's been fixed
---
grinding out the bright dust to purchase eververse armor
---
oh yeah? Look at the drum of Love &amp; Hate. You'll never unsee it.
---
Burden quest?
---
Called that cause on radar they are blue blips in social spaces. Fireteam members are green. For some reason, people use “blueberry” for rando team members or idiots.
---
Thank you for filling my shitty morning with joy
---
Oh my bad. I actually tried to do a quick search, couldn't find any posts about it. Im sorry in that case! Thanks for pointing that out.
---
I know I dont mean it, but getting old now. Bungie stop release broke crap. how hard tests make sure quest works before stating fix.
---
The currated one is pretty solid. I'm gonna go for a roll with tap the trigger/multikill clip.
---
I haven't used it in PvP but I still feel like this is a PvP weapon and will do well, BUT there are way better heavy exotic options that's for sure.  It is a bit underwhelming overall innit?
---
Mine leans a little heavier towards the skipping sections part, but the actual enemies is spot on 😂
---
There should be a box in your inventory that you need to open.
---
Vermillion is sexy af
---
I did this with my Hunter, even has a vex leg
---
No problem, at least you didn't post a picture of that group of ghosts :P
---
Party on Garth
---
Probably at least 1 other person.  My brother and I did it without a third, but it wasn’t too easy.  Took around an hour and a half.  It’s probably an easier solo than Shattered Throne, but still difficult obviously.
---
over a thousand now, I think you are safe :)
---
:)
---
Yeah probably around 5k bright dust with the way they’re hiking up prices.
---
😂
---
Was there a hotfix after the current Tuesday Update for Festival for the Lost because the Izanagi quest was bugged even worse after that update, eating up people's rare bounties without progressing.
---
Thanks, just found it!
---
What’s the name of this shader I need to use it now.
---
It might just be that the dungeon is meant to be really difficult, it is a pinnacle reward. I just tagged along with a clan member who’s already maxed out and plays loads.
---
have you tried to apply it to the armor yet? it might already be unlocked. i had this problem with hunter. also check consumables as it can sometimes appear as a box like package you need to open. hope this helps.
---
I don't believe OP has ever done a raid if this easy event got sand in their pussy.
---
Because people upvoted it!?
---
Yeah, I got over a thousand candy just playing normally for a few hours
---
Haha damn well I guess ya'll be running it again on thursday
---
No problem, at least you admitted you made a mistake. Normally most people are too smug to say that :P
---
Sadly I don’t record my gameplay.
---
If this is real........wow, just wow... :)
---
Forsaken would be the previous years content. Shadowkeep is more expensive since it came out Oct 1st. It's the current story line and there is lots to do within each of the dlc. I was a big fan of forsaken but now that they changed a lot of stuff it seems there are mostly only group activities and a few guns tied behind it. Most players will be doing content that is within shadowkeep for the progression but you don't really need to worry about that. If you're afraid you will run out of things to do I'd highly recommend checking out some videos and maybe searching for a clan. From there you can decide what you'd want to beat suit your needs!
---
If you are on ps4 and want someone to play with I recently have just come back to the game. I have the platinum on destiny 1 and 2. Everyone I know quit. Psn-crazykidbad
---
Warframe and destiny have been on good terms with each other on twitter they chit chat sometimes. Respect for both of then honestly.
---
I was on Ishtarcommander going through my old guns and wanted to use this for Momentum control and the stats glitched
---
The "Bought Seasons" allows you to access the content for those seasons, still in game, namely The Lost Forges, Reckoning, and the Menagerie.
---
Besides people running around with sniper rides rabbit and recluse trinity ghoul is amazing
---
No. I prefer my hunters unsymmetrical. Imo that's what makes them the most fashionable class (I almost always love their armor. Warlocks, nothing matters but the chest and helm, and Titan sets are very hit and miss.)
---
Dlc isn't really "required" but after a while you'll most likely run out of things to keep doing, so having the dlc will of course give you lots more to do. 
---
If Forsaken is on sale for you I recommend getting it, it adds a ton to the game and will give you hours of more play. ShadowKeep as well, at some point, would also be a good thing to get, as before you get lots to do.  
---
Tldr: you're not required to get any of the new things, but if you want to add more to the game and get your moneys worth, buy them when you can.
---
Was looking for a scout for Momentum control and I think I found it
---
I have school and part time job on weekends and I'm rank 70 and have Divinty
---
If you buy shadowkeep you also get the season pass.
---
Ha-ha, very ingenious. Yes, correlation doesn't mean causation but the timing is super suspicious and if there's a chance the issue is on Bungie's side they need to know.
---
Thank you very much this is exactly what I needed to know. Bless you
---
Yes.
---
Well here what I know you get 3 raids with forsaken about 10 exotic quests plus a bunch of random exotics access to more ordeals the best campaign of destiny 2,the reckoning challenges ,spider the queen of glimmer and materials, a lot of the black armory quests
---
(Everything in forsaken)
---
I always thought this sub would have an older/more mature age range but I’ve noticed lately it’s not that different from a lot of the kid flooded game subs. So whenever you’re getting downvoted for an obvious joke here just know it’s probably some 12 year old lol
---
the first season is included in shadow keep! so just buy that and you get both. season 2 and 3 however will be sold separately. alternatively you could buy all 3 season in one pass, its up to you. i would go with one at a time though, that way if you fall out of love with the game or the upcoming season doesn't interest you.. you can simply skip it :) hope this helped!
---
Okay this is pretty cool.
---
I made it, that was me and I found it in my videos
---
Pies
---
Maybe now she can look with her eyes instead of touching EVERYTHING.
---
1200 per character i believe, so 3600 per week. Every bounty gives 200 and you got 2 for crucible, gambit and strikes
---
So, the helmet is obvious, gloves are Reverie Dawn gloves with New Age Black Armory, robes are Prodigal with Crucible Lazurite, and boots are the Vanguard boots with the Season 2 ornament and Amythest Veil. Bond is the common Bond of Refuge.
---
Bugged I can’t even hand in my hand key tried twice and it didn’t work
---
Excellent advice my friend!! Thank you
---
OMG thanks for the laugh... glad dumb luck isn't only focused on me... :)
---
New player here. What's a pursuit?
---
Literally nowhere is this explained. 
---
There are quests, you do them, they end, regular stuff. Bounties, you do them, they end. My pursuits though don't seem to ever end? I finally did Season 8: First watch, did all the things and now it just shows new things to do. Do these repeat on their own or are they just really long bounties that will end at some point?
---
Do you use 2 factor by any chance
---
Make sure you've installed the update. Fixed it for me
---
I literally test them on closest alive enemy even when it’s a dreg and I’m testing a Fusion Rifle
---
So why cant we have a ttk that allows for wins from the 1 player? Kinda like cod?
---
It's actually even worse in PvP than PvE. You only get 3 shots and it takes 2 to kill.
---
Makes me think of Hiccup and Stoik and I love it.
---
Lol they for sure made it worse by accident I tried to hand in a key twice and didn’t count
---
Yikessssss. This is what I get for procrastinating so much right away I suppose.
---
New to Reddit so not sure if posting videos is cool, but this explains the situation currently.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBijLhZufQk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBijLhZufQk)
---
Punching stuff makes me happy! :)
---
If she was gonna steal someone's eyes shouldn't she have taken them from someone with perfect vision SMGDH.
---
I'm not implying they always had a problem with security, they couldn't run successful multiplayer games if that was the case. The timing here is however so suspicious that I though I'd post about it to possibly get them to investigate internally.
---
Definitely do it, its super fun and super rewarding, I did Bug LMG run and it took me one and a half hours, I imagine regular run shouldn't take more than a hour.
---
What’s a titan without their big shoulders?
---
I got to branch 7 on my first run, there was at least one person(me) who had no clue what was happening. Realistically, one of the others was also lost.
---
Got to branch 8 on the second run. We would have made it past, if we'd paid attention to the modifiers. We had to backtrack twice. 
---
It's not that hard. Even running it with randos, I'd say you can get branch 9 clears pretty consistently.
---
Guess what I'm trying to say is...gitgud.
---
No I won't. He has the damn gun. He can burn it now for all I care. 
---
My information was 80s sitcom level of misunderstanding between what my friend was doing and what I was doing. 
---
Literally every step of the quest I have a story of where it went wrong 😂.
---
My aggressive frame/outlaw/kill clip Crimil's Dagger plus a sniper rifle (usually Fate Cries Foul) is pretty successful.  I also have been using Eriana's Vow (no completed catalyst) because I need solar kills.
---
If I can get a precision kill with that hand cannon (pretty easy to do), I reload insanely fast and get a massive damage boost.  Once I get the initial kill, I can frequently get another 2+ right afterwards.
---
Thats not all they broke lol i made a video on it if you feel like checking it out :  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBijLhZufQk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBijLhZufQk)
---
Yes especially cause forsaken is on sale still I think
---
Most of the time, I find you can get to 100% with three expansions, sometimes two
---
For sure get shadowkeep. That way you'll be able to do all of the raids except the new one, and you'll be able to see all the other content
---
Not with Steam, that was my one vice as I didn't want to be vulnerable on that side (where I live it's more likely to get your physical device stolen than a network account).
---
*crows wings intensifies*
---
Just for safety sake I'd run your AntiMalware of whatever you choose, scan for viruses too. Then change all ur passcodes.
---
Hope you hear back from Steam. I'd be on the phone raising hell.
---
Tokens
---
Sure if its goood I'll sub
---
you get access to some of the previous content from past seasons, but having purchased forsaken will give you access to everything. so you basically just have a little more content.. oh and a few exotics. some very good ones actually aha
---
Thx bb wanna see my torch hammer? ;)
---
I'm losing hope. Nobody seems to know.
---
Where is he? I tried to check on him after getting Ace of Spades and couldnt find him anywhere.
---
Wait did you just say that your rank cant go down anymore?!?!?!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Forty four is the shader
---
I know. But the glaring issue is that it's still not enough.
---
This titan may or may not be a ditto
---
Thank you guardian.
---
Yeh i think so....
---
i love drop mag, works really well with kill clip
---
Thanks man :)
---
HAPPINESS NOISES!!!!!!
---
First time I did the haunted forest and that happened it scared the her living fuck out of me. Must’ve been my fireteams first time too as we all ran around the room panicked and using all our super/heavy on him thinking we had to kill him somehow
---
Can you make it bigger?
---
So would a good route be visiting the planetary vendors on each destination, getting and completing their daily bounties every day while working on the weeklies?
---
DLC isn’t required.
---
Forsaken’ll give you all of the best guns and gear.
---
Shadowkeep will give you the new relevant content.
---
Whats your psn? If u wanna make a fireteam later and grind?
---
Remember when prison of elder didn't even count as located on tangled shore?
---
Damnn I kept some of the caydes oddities but I don’t think I ever got that one. Reminds me of all the fun stuff from D1 like the ascendant raisins and such
---
Has a winner been chosen yet? If not I'd like to put my name in the running
---
How psychedelic would it be if the Darkness race showed up in Destiny 3 and it turns out they look like cat and rabbit aliens.
---
Or just give them candy for nothing in return I'd be interested in how many people would give it candy more than once.
---
Lol sure...
---
SuperwoIf_x
---
The L is actually an uppercase i btw
---
Grind smart not hard. Go around picking up every single bounty then spend about a minute lookin at where they overlap. Look if you have any bounties that require kills with certain weapons and lets say you have sword kills, grenade launcher kills and scout kills and also void kills; then you wanna find those weapons in void and equip them. It’s about finishing as many bounties together instead of one at a time
---
I'm planning on buying a ps4 and moving my account across to PS4 to play with friends, but I still want to play on PC until I pick up the console. The Cross-save screen when I load the game up makes me unsure whether I can do this once I start playing. Is this ok to do or will it mess something up?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Also, I saw someone down in the comments say I could switch between my PC and PS4 on the same account and keep all progress. Is this actually true? Can I also play with PS4 friends from my PC or is that only possible when I'm physically playing on the PS4?
---
Found it - [Lore book: Dust, entry: The Witch](https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/the-witch#the-nine)
---
Before she is kidnaped by Savathun, Lavina learns that one of the Nine blinded the cities sensors to the approach of the Red Legion, as they were attepmpting to learn how to steal the light. The book states that this member of the nine was 'punished' - the theory about it being Mercury's fault is speculation, but I think it's reasonable enough.

Like I said... only if your dogshit
---
Nitefly5150 capital n, u on ps4 tho?
---
I love the look of helmets with no eye holes but my 'in universe explanation' is that we use the light to see when our eyes are obstructed, kinda like Toph from Avatar.
---
Oopse didnt mean to put this seperate from the replays lol
---
Thank you!
---
Bungie rewards.
---
Is it still available? If I got my hands on a code, I'd buy it for sure
---
not worth the quest line to get it. can't crit, does lack luster damage in PvE, needs 2 shots in PvP when picking up heavy only gives you 3
---
Im guardian 3 what rank are u?
---
So, unless you can generate more than 3,600 BD per week, you're shit?
---
Yes I'm on ps4
---
Whats unbroken? Everyone ive seen with that banner (only two of em) have sucked ass, and lost us our games. A losing streak thing?
---
I don't ever play Titan but i need this helmet.
---
Cool
---
Wait, since when will it not go down? Did I miss something in the TWAB?
---
Pretty sure they’re talking about the fallen spawn where you can infinitely chain sunspot solar explosion kills from a single shot.
---
U have a mic?
---
A fate worse than death
---
only for exotics
---
Whatever your light level is before the artifact that what the power level will be
---
Can confirm, have done this.
---
Very true.  LOL.
---
Crotas bane shell and blasphemer
---
Looks like an egg in an eggcup
---
It's a glorious rite of passage
---
Black Armory mold is from Bergusia forge
---
If you still have it, I'll take it
---
Someone's angy...
---
You have followers?
---
I dont remember...
---
The last time I played comp was mid last season so I prolblably went down quite a bit sence than
---
True.  When Forsaken dropped there were no really good Auto Rifles, except for Suros Regime, maybe?  But not much else.
---
So I have to shoot the drones like normal and get max temper to get the mold?
---
Where do you find the skeleton outfits?
---
Sadly, no : (
---
First bounty I would work on is moon stuff. From there, drifter and gambit have a ton of bounties but only pick up the ones that say XP. Be sure to also pick up ada bounties and Werner 99 cuz sometimes they’re simply “kill thing with x” or “kill certain enemy type”. Before you even go to the moon pick up all the bounties from ikora. Then you wanna do your moon bounties but also keep a close watch for a vez incursion so you can finish ikora bounties as well. Most importantly are weekly bounties, they reward the most xp. Also don’t forget gunsmith and spider bounties, the ones that require 5 ghost shells give good glimmer, xp and even an enhancement core.
---
I think it means either if u reach a new rank (brave,heroic,etc) and then lose u cant go back down to the rank below that, or that when u reach a new subrank u cant go back down maybe?
---
You do lose glory points when you lose and you lose even more when u lose in steaks took me 2 days to get it 6 hrs a day each but iron banner helped me get the 100% wins
---
Any time a weapon looks like it is crap or doesn’t have a place, I look to No Land Beyond. Everyone thought that was crap, too. Until it wasn’t.
---
And how much beightdust have you collected after shadowkeep? You must be quite the gamer 🤤
---
In the eververse store and there should be like a festival of the lost symbol
---
Pretty sure loseing streaks have been removed now
---
Yep. Just like that. Also do you have a rare bounty saved up?
---
And another one, way to be original dude
---
Full ranks are locked up to fabled, you can still drop sub ranks, I.e. you can go from guardian 3 back to guardian 1.  After fabled you lose this protection but will never drop below fabled in the season.
---
I kept mine too :)
---
I liked my tigerspite!
---
I killed a pursuing spec blades with claws of the wolf
---
I'm gonna look at that. Cause I know I've lost glory this season, but I haven't gone down a rank.
---
Yeh, u?
---
Ouch. That's me with escalation protocol, still missing sniper and smg
---
[Uh, are you sure?](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/dp8cmm/rasputin_shot_first/f5t9lgm/)
---
Hows the shell look?
---
They could run it as a social experiment and track how many people have given it once, twice, etc. It would be cool if they had a reward for giving it 10 candy but never told anyone
---
I still have a fake strange coin I think
---
I came back to this game halfway through Season of the Drifter, so I got some valuable bonding time with IKELOS HC, back when I used 180s!
---
Btw my internet is about to crash so dont be surprised if it takes me a min to reply to u
---
Aww, i was hoping sub ranks would be protected, but hey i only gotra get through 6 ranks right? Brave 1-3 and then heroic 1-3 right?
---
I ended up just reinstalling to be sure while I was working and it worked!
---
I don't know what happened though, isn't Steam supposed to download the update automatically?
---
Yes, ill be on in a little while
---
Yep sadly it was the one where it was 50 charged on forged lol. I did 49 so I didn’t accidentally finish the bounty and collect rewards
---
That would be an alright perk for pvp. Drop mag isn't as good in pve scenarios, since you're wasting a lot of ammo.
---
I heard. Very sad. So weak for decent quest line.No crit dmg must be a bug. If that bug is removed it can be really good.fingers crossed
---
Like I said before, other people aint getting it in. I am not wasting my time(on refarming the keys and waiting for the rotation) until they fix it. Just not worth it. But thanks for your time mate, much appreciate it.
---
Pretty good, like a normal shell, but with a purple color and a nice pattern that looks like the shadowkeep symbol
---
Lol same I on my way home rn
---
He just seems so happy about it. Like a parent when his child calls him dad for the first time.
---
Underwhelming exotic wasted time doing it could of grind some pinnicLe in that time
---
&gt; because that's Calus' prison ship stuck on autopilot
---
IIRC, it was only on autopilot until he reached the edge of the universe, then he regained control &amp; intentionally brought it here.
---
Ill shoot u a friend request in a bit
---
Ah yes the IKELOS I remember trying to use that but I wasn’t feeling it as good as my other void HC
---
Go into your consumables and open the package first. It keeps it in a package that has a refund option in case you accidentally bought it. Just open it and then it’ll add the effect to your mods. But it only gives you one btw. You can buy more from collections
---
Sick whip! What did you have to do to earn it?
---
Annual pass gives you access to the DLC from forsaken
---
Ate them by mistake
---
just go to spider lol
---
It's the same as a normal sword, the melee button. Unlike normal swords it negates all damage coming your way. Spash damage can sometimes mess with it though.
---
mafs
---
I have it and I think it’s the best pvp role
---
With shadowkeep we paid for an ongoing story, season pass for the activities in it, where did we pay for season of the lost cosmetics? Or the time to do those things? I'm just confused on where people are getting this idea that even $60 once a year is going to give you access to hundreds of developer hours of cosmetics. Content sure. But not cosmetics
---
If you do happen to fall in and die it spawns you at the chest. Also if you fall there is a way out on the right if you jump
---
Apparently sorting by new for some reason is illegal, and you get downvotes. It not if when all of you who sort by hot post it's people like me who see it first.... And yes now I'm salty :(
---
I like the prodigal chest piece for hunter.    
---
I don't think there's anything feminine for titan, but probably prodigal chest again.  
---
For warlock philomath robe was my favorite, not because it was feminine, but because it looked the best.  
---
As far as full sets, I don't think any full set looks good. I mix and match.
---
I took a screenshot on Tuesday when I saw that.
---
well thats obviously a bargain
---
or as the cool kids these days are saying: best BANG for the BUCK
---
Nah it a because gambit is a casual activity between strikes and crucible so people just don’t try as hard. It’s nice that everyone isn’t using meta weapons imo.
---
i already had black armory before that
---
Count me in!
---
To re-acquire something you need to have found it once already.
---
You first find the "Gambit Leather" shader from dismantling gambit gear that comes with the shader already.
---
Really good job👍🏻 I like the shading
---
Every guardian with no self respect
---
aside from the forsaken campaign, what can i do with an annual pass?
---
Or they could just put everyone in the same area.
---
Took me a while to realise it was needed to turn around.
---
I’m new to Destiny on PC and Steam, but I couldn’t log on yesterday either, which was because the update did not download automatically. Not sure if it’s because my Steam isn’t setup right or something.
---
Guys, this gun SLAPS in PVP and PVE clearing.
---
honestly if i have 10\~motes before primeval is up i'd just go with 15 just for the fact that random newbies can't deal with knights
---
Quick tip: Moving any directions while spamming the projectile attack is faster than just spamming the projectile attack. Moving stops the animation after launching the projectile allowing you to follow it up with another faster.
---
You mean the old content they gave away for free? Or the new content we paid for? Which one does the extra season content fall under?
---
Right but I thought you said Trust always came with the shader in your experience? Made me think you'd gotten it before
---
My bad, I couldn't find a way to turn it around, sorry.
---
Nah I’m not bothered about the cosmetics. They can be behind pay walls, sorry. However they should put seasonal event items such as a hidden quest to get a new class item ornament (like the toothbrush quest) as a thank you to the people who continually play (like other mmorpgs) and make them seasonally locked.
---
I mean bungie made the armor pretty much gender neutral. Why? Because its armor. Its supposed to be effective. Not good looking.
---
#THIS IS AMAZING!!!
---
not yet, might see something on the TWAB. hope a massive buff to xenophage also
---
Whereisxur.com
---
is this a new dungeon?
---
Trust always has the shader, but 99% of the time when you dismantle the gun you aren't awarded with the shader.
---
No problem it’s still really good.
---
*inhale* SPOOKY SCARY SKELETONS

Do you want the hunter symbol on the arm too or would you prefer titan, warlock or nothing? $20 each. $25 if shipping outside the US. PayPal is ianblank.com@outlook.com
---
Thank you! I love cats so much
---
Dead ass wont be proud
---
I see there is someone downvoting every word I say. Why do I have a feeling that someone got killed by a toxic Dawnblade and thinks it is me? xD
---
This season we have Festival of the Lost (Halloween), next season we have The Dawning and Crimson Days (Christmas and Valentines), then the season after that we have The Revelry (Easter/Spring event), and finally Solstice of Heroes (Summer event with really cool armor).
---
Huh, weird
---
Are you doing nightfall: the ordeal or the weekly nightfall? Because the five of swords is for the weekly nightfall.
---
That's because what you did is correct and what they did is not.
---
coulda been a public event Caused by Escalation Protocol, which might buff the enemies generated by the event.
---
Yes and there is another time it played in the beginning of the main campaign
---
mfw i get killed by handheld supernova for the 60th time in one match
---
Thank you, I spend about an hour coloring it.
---
rip
---
its inspired by the star wars posters and it took a couple weeks to finish (ive been quite busy with school) but now its finally done, i hope you all like it! :D
---
Same here, the only sin I’ve done this “expansion cycle” was buying the deluxe shadowkeep which personally I don’t count as an additional cost.
---
Free game no bitching
---
What is this?
---
what mask is this
---
Excellent timing!
---
Look up a video on YouTube. It will be easier to spot when your in the area near it.
---
Same issue here
---
i was trying to help dude my bad
---
I don’t know. It was yesterday when I reset my artifact and I did it without thinking. I just checked today.
---
Burn it with fire!
---
No i don't think they knew enough beyond the basics.
---
I was surprised he himself didn't come at me when I killed his waifu Mara Sov.
---
Shit happens. All good
---
Where is the only question needed here
---
All I see is Grey Fox
---
You ruined it for me, I'm leaving
---
He trained the people who killed you, he probably didn't see you worth the time.
---
Also it is saying UPnP not successful. Is there any way to fix that?
---
Try looking by the manufacturer
---

So this is weird, but I'm not sure if you check your Reddit messages, so I'm jumping on your post to let you know to please check your message from me lol
---
I read the lore, so surprised I didn't know :P
---
Premium pass rewards as well.  All bout that Vex.
---
That looks awesome
---
Noice, bout to do mine xD
---
Collections tab &gt; flair &gt; emblems
---
If you read anything in all caps in a shaxx voice it makes everything better
---
Ok? So what your saying is you want everyone who sorts by new to upvote discussions?
---
I just hit 962 last night and it didn't take too much work when being efficient about it. Our clan did all the powerful drops when the reset hit which is the main source of upgrades so make sure you do everything you can. Additionally if you're not in a clan you should consider joining, the engrams you get from the tasks help round out your lesser slots.
---
The gate lords eye will help a lot as well, picking up the bounties to do while you're doing the daily and weekly missions knocks out two things at once.
---
Once you exhaust the powerful drops from activities focus on 920 related stuff since the drops are much more generous.
---
I run a lot of crucible and the 3 blue drops per game were usually above my light so I threw all those on everytime it was an improvement and the overall light was pretty consistent until 950. The last 10 light or so took about as long as the 750 to 950.
---
There's no reason to rush it though, since there is no iron banner right now and the only real reason to do the 950 stuff is to increase your light more to do higher stuff, it becomes a cycle.
---
It's even better now that I finally got Shaxx's mask !
---
Thanks kind stranger!
---
Out of curiosity what should I be looking for on the perks?
---
Worth it
---
No problem
---
Edit: it's in the events tab under emblems
---
Because they can use the search bar and see that it’s been posted every half out since reset yesterday
---
word
---
That's what I'm saying bro. Been waiting forever it feels
---
Yeah its either an oversight or they purposely left it underpowered but weapons usually perform differently in the sandbox vs when its implemented in the community, unforseeable things can happen with its values. I do think they purposely did it and have to deal with a broken overpowered weapon. Originally it was probably 3x more powerful but came across a bug that could've been exploited for pure melting power on bosses. Hopefully they fix it soon, so it can be fun to use and not just some power weapon taking up an exotic slot.
---
Same here man its ridiculous
---
You still get them from strike and crucible but you need to use one of the runefinder thing
---
I can already tell by this video you're terrible at the game
---
The robot sell a Runefinder consumable that allows you to randomly get runes from running various activities in the game. Lasts for 4 hours.
---
Check the postmaster
---
nothing there :(
---
Thanks for the info. I was going to do this quest today but if the gun is trash then duck it.
---
It shoots mini rockets. Rockets don’t crit. Pretty sure it’s intentional. Explosive rounds already exist in the game if they intended for this weapon to have explosive rounds similar to a scout or hand cannons then they would of just applied that perk.
---
It’s broken. No idea when it will be fixed.
---
That triumph doesn’t have a reward tied to it? I’m shitting at work right now so I’ll have a look through my triumphs and see if I can find it
---
Unless you have a gaming laptop it more than likely won’t run well
---
Why are you apologizing for art?!
---
I do know this might not work for you, it's not for everyone, but I DO think the closest thing to this you can get would be just subscribing to Google stadia and getting literally the cheapest laptop you can buy. As long as the internet works, you can play destiny 2 on there no problem, and I think I remember Google saying stadia members get destiny 2 for free. Might be worth a check. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

How do u get that low draw time?

wait he says rick kakis all the time? all i hear is "red cactus" with an accent xD

always wondered what he was actually saying, TIL. 
---
Thanks.

I'm on my warlock and I'll be dammed if I do the opening quests on the moon again
---
No, doesn't matter if u cross save ur account to another system. If on the system ur currently on, you do not own that needed dlc, you will NOT get access on it. Dlcs and expansions are system specific.
---
I must have hit it right.  I bought a few and finished my season.
---
😂😂😂😂😂
---
Lol I got you. But your right. I like the idea, the concept is great. But the execution is severely flawed.
---

I thought you meant Cayde :/
---
I can't even tell if that's a pumpkin...

It assimilates. Kabr drank it, once. The radiolaria took his mind, his body, his Ghost. His last act as himself was to shape his infected ghost and what Light he had left into a shield against the forces at work in the Vault of Glass, that the next fire team did not meet the same fate.
---
Similarly, A Thing Was Done to Asher Mir within the Pyramidion. His arm is a Vex arm. When he pricks the opposite hand, he bleeds radiolaria. He can feel the Vex. He feels his condition progressing.
---
It is possible, even probable, that Asher is the next iteration of an experiment that began when Kabr drank of that Oracle.
