i thought that was someone dressed like a bear in the bottom left hand corner
---
---
---
You say that, and in theory yes, but it is a very hard target considering the constant bashing of right bumper and is easily evaded if the hunter has any semblance of sense
---
‚ÄúSuddenly‚Äù
---
I kid u not my last game of gambit before coming off i killed 20 guardians and deposited like 70 motes
---
Jealous, good for you guys!
---
Difficult triumph? You can't be serious, yo. You just can't be serious. All it requires is just time investment. Not wins, not skilled gameplay. Just time.  
---
Do bounties, play gambit, kill envoys, repeat. Don't even have to win, although it makes the climb a bit faster.  
---
When approaching 12k points, collect some bounties. We have numerous +50 and +100 bounties this season.  
---

---
I play gambit literally 2-4 times a day on two characters (more bounties). 1-2 games on one, 1-2 games on second. Sometimes I miss a day, does not matter.  
---
With such poor time investment and roughly 50-55% winrate, I reset my rank today and have 70% of envoy kills.  
---
This triumph is not difficult at all. It merely requires time investment.  
---
My issue is with the main perk itself, not the healing. It's that the helmet punishes other players for PLAYING the game 
---
Titan forever
---
I don't think so, otherwise you get the same situation that spectral blades is in. A super tanky, hard to kill, super fast, and super deadly mother **** chasing your whole team killing all in its wake 
---
Got this shotgun with one-two punch perk. This thing's a beast. Point blank shot at medium blocker + punch = dead blocker.
---
Nice. There are two people on my friends list that we became destiny buds back in D1. Wed jump on and essentially run everything in a day together. They left at D2 and randomly popped back on when it went free on PlayStation, then disappeared again into the Void Light
---
Should message them and see if they want to hang, we apparently don‚Äôt live far from each other. Miss playing with them Destiny, always had too much fun with them.
---
You need the entire set for the glow, and it only glows in gambit prime
---
What are rolls? And is master working charge time a bad idea or it won‚Äôt hurt it that much?
---
IKELOS HC in Competitive 
---
I just got it this weekend. It‚Äôs good but it also requires some skill. Like if you‚Äôre hiding behind a rock it won‚Äôt hit you like sleeper. You can also dodge it with hunter dodge. But if it tracks on to you well, gg.
---
Damn, both of you are handsome :sss
---
Mmm, it takes long time in the refuge, when I talk with NPCs, when I use the navigator, when I launch the game.
---
Auto Loading - Midrange scope - Range finder - Auto Loading Holster - handling master work
---
I honestly can't tell the difference between a 800 and a 900 charge time put I'm sure some people can, if you have a charge time masterwork then definitely go for it. 
---
Never forget Marty too
---
Got my recluse solo only. It‚Äôs possible lads 
---
Yeah. You have to do that for each weapon.
---
It is still an option. You just lose put on perks. 
---
Just infuse lol
---
I know but you miss all the good perks! 
---
Do literally any activity. You will get gear to increase your power level. You can do this until you reach power level 500. After that point, only activities that specify "powerful gear" as the reward will give you higher power level gear. But for now, absolutely anything will power you up. 
---
Absolutely. And i started with Forsaken
---
and then a shotgun ape shoots you in the back
---
Have you done all the adventures? If not be sure to finish those up!
---
I‚Äôve done it. Here‚Äôs my link: https://www.bungie.net/en/Profile/ReferAFriend?code=RAF-F4A-NK4-TY9
---
I‚Äôm only level 40 :(
---
There is no point to keeping 99% of the gear you have. Blue rarity gear is never worth keeping. Some items, if they are exotic or from the first year of the game, you can make copies of from the collections tab of the character menu, so you shouldn't keep them unless you use them regularly. 
---
Items from the second year of the game have random perks. Most combinations aren't going to be special enough to save. You should keep an eye out for perks that you like, that sound useful. For example, if you like to use grenade launchers, you should use a helmet and/or class item with grenade launcher reserves (increased ammo capacity). Similarly, even if you use a lot of hand cannons, hand cannon reserves really does not matter because you basically never run out of hand cannon ammo. On guns, most people look for one perk that increases reload speed and another that increases damage. Outlaw and rampage are a popular combination, or outlaw and kill clip. 
---
Where are those/what are they? Very new to d2
---
So we're just going to let these witches run free and eat our children?
---
I usually run a hand cannon primary, Ikelos SG secondary, and Bellowing Giant or Sleepless for heavy. Lately I've been running an AR primary and Oxygen S3 secondary though, the Oxygen scout is so satisfying for mid-long range.
---
Quick question. Do you have to win the match for the envoy kills to count? It says envoys and primeval, does it count if you kill envoys but not your primeval? Or does it only count to kill all and win the match?
---
I have one call out and it‚Äôs prospector 
---
Truth. Players jump into the grinder doing annoying quests with handicapped loadouts, providing easy points for the sweaty apes.
---
Thanks for letting me know. I‚Äôll leave it anyhow. 
---
I feel like the lesser armor sets were maybe intended to ease us into that style of Gambit, slowly unlocking new perks as we unlock new tiers, it could have been done better by, say, upgrading your Tier I set to II and so on. 
---
That's correct, you can up your rank with bounties, and a lot of them during this season. In fact, you do not even require a single to win in order to be able to reset the tank. 
---
Glad to hear you enjoy it. 
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong I do enjoy aspects of it, but there are certain of aspects about it that put me off, I‚Äôll usually take a look at the daily modifiers then decide whether I want to give it a go or not. 
---
I wish I had the urge to go into Reckoning whenever I want, not when the modifiers suit me, that‚Äôs the main point of my rant about them. 
---
Oof. Been there dude.
---
Games like that make me feel like I'm literally just playing with bots on my team. 
---
I‚Äôve gotten every piece of the reaper set 5 times EXCEPT the helmet, not even once
---
just do it when arc singe is on, least amount of ads have arc in it and Chaos Reach/ThunderCrash are stupid strong.
---
Sometimes you lose a match without even getting to envoys. Sometimes you are not the one who kills the envoys. Besides, in basic gambit you usually encounter much less envoys than in prime gambit. That's how it works. I got a reset before completing the envoys task, and many other people are in a similar situation. Nothing strange about it.  
---
The fact remains the same: you do not even require a single win in order to reset a gambit rank. I have only four resets, but I am quite convinced that I know what I am talking about.
---
Crown at +10, glow at +15
---
He told me the drifter didn‚Äôt have them when he want to talk to him
---
It really has its ups and downs. I played solo to get both Lunas and the SMG the past week. Went up to 1600 the dropped to 700 and then up to 2114. My advice just play patiently and just stop playing for a couple of hours if you match against 4stacks. You cant always get lucky
---
That‚Äôs my favorite bar in Manhattan! 
---
I‚Äôve gotten the invader helm close to 20 times now, and the chest at least 6, I still have yet to get even a single pair of the boots, gloves or bond from any tier of the armor set
---
I actually attended an in-game wedding. Lol
---
I also was in the same world when Zezima got married in RuneScape. Haha
---
I‚Äôll take Salvatori over Marty any day, look at Marty‚Äôs work (D1 vanilla) and Salvatori (everything since) Salvatori‚Äôs is 10x better every time. The taken king‚Äôs soundtrack for example.. 10x better. Marty is wonderful but Salvatori is the genius with no credit
---
Wow I've grinded both raids have neither
---
I can concur this on PC as well. I ran a normal strike on my 680 hunter and normally i one shot the tank because its usually sustained enough damage during the knockdown phase and i actually double took when it survived the shot. Obv Celestial Hawk on bottom tree. 
---
Didnt they just buff damage to bosses from GG?
---
That title though...
---
Lol I love a block away from that pub ü§£
---
Leave him be he's I'm a restricted zone
---
All I seem to read is that Destiny's an "online multiplayer game" so anybody trying to play solo is stupid and offensive and ugly, etc etc etc. I mean, why do they even sell us the game if we ain't buying it with 2 friends. Oh yeah, the money!! 
---
I actually don‚Äôt remember :(
---
Just finished the grind yesterday or the day before for 21% Delirium (solo only). Started to grind for the service revolver today with a rollout of Jade Rabbit, Trust and 21%. Averaging about 50% precision kills per strike.
---
I love 21%, it's great at clearing minor and major spec stuff and with backup mag and overflow I have ~230 bullets before reload.
---
Mine is like that! Totally OP haha
---
lol Good lord!! You referenced the 2nd worst set, only to point out the WORST set!!!lol But yeah, they're both utter garbage.!
---
Still better than the reskins...
---
Actually its taken king haha so they did actually decrypt into exotics... but don‚Äôt remember which ones lol
---
I don't like invading either so I thought I would hate this step, but once I started working at it I found not that bad at all.
---
I used Thunderlord. Your opponents won't know where you are unless they see you, so use obstacles to block sightlines and get as close as you can, then lay into them. Remember you're overshielded so it's pretty hard to lose a 1V1 gunfight when you have the drop on them. Most people will be running from you rather than engaging, and a surprising number of people just keeping collecting motes as if they didn't get the memo.
---
A teamwipe won't always be in the cards - sometimes people are too spread out or sometimes you get hit with a rocket. But you can invade like 5 times in a match, so just grab that heavy ammo and rinse &amp; repeat until you get it.
---
I went from never having invaded in my life to my first teamwipe within about 10 games.
---
You will be missed :‚Äô( and d1 lol
---
I am trying to minmax by doing both at once 
---
titans by far the worse.. ask anyone good or any pro player
---
This drives me insane! Nice to know I'm not the only one. 
---
Ah, yeah I figured somebody might have said it. I used to watch Byf, still occasionally do, but I'm more of a Myelin Games fan myself.
---
That I know of it‚Äôs only one can‚Äôt recall
---
Of course
---
Lol true, I hope he made it out
---
Literally just had a pint there 2 hours ago. Cheers guardians.
---
If you use an smg and spam swap no tiny sliver of a weapon will appear in the bottom. I take a lot of screenshots.
---
If it makes u feel better our lfg leader kicked my team and I right after we killed the last boss on SotP but before we got loot
---
Yes, it is comfortable. The text where it says the percentage of materials has faded, but it didn't shrink much or at all from washing if that helps.  
---
That's one of them Amazon Echoes
---
We took turns running new content on all 3 classes, always, but from day 1, Destiny 1 it was (left to right) Titan, Warlock, Hunter. I switched to titan shortly thereafter and never looked back. 
---
I don't think oryx ever invaded the fallen homeworld though.
---
Made with mematic
---
I still use Braytech Legs because no leg armor perks matter to me at all due to absolute insignificance outside of enhanced perks 
---
Servitors cant be taken. As they are only machine, same as cabal sentries and fallen shanks. Vex are in part organic and can be. 
---
The malfesance boss and voices of riven are quimera and we dont know what they are made off.
---
(If im wrong please someone correct me, i havent seen if we have new lore around this)
---
Give this guy gold. This is beautiful
---
Awwww
---
I'd say that it was random chance that I saw that, also I'm proud to know that there is one more person playin D2 out there.
---
You can hold up to 5 ethereal keys at a time. I've heard people speculate that the loot drop is determined by the key, so if that is the case, saving keys wouldn't do you any good. I guess if you really want to, there's no harm in trying. 
---
All raid loot is once per week per character, so yes, you can get three ethereal keys per week.

Mine wasnt too bad solo. Took like a week doing a couple hours a day on nova bomb warlock with skull. I got lucky with decent teams though and had a 15 win streak close to the end. 
---
Oh nice! Go to the NPC 'The Drifter' and pick up power surge quests which give you a full set of blue gear at LL 640 to help you catch up. 
---
I still recommend going through the story missions for these expansions (especially Forsaken ) but if you don't feel like it for whatever reason and want to level then just go through your weekly powerful engram challenges which'll show a small icon beside planet/activity on the global map.
---
If you can find a group, Escalation Protocol (on Mars ) drops the Ikelos shotgun this week and one of my favourite things to do in D2.
---
I certainly haven't covered everything but this should get you started.
---
Recluse is a beast. It‚Äôs the most fun I‚Äôve ever had 
---
Still on about OEM? Smh
---
I love it! Same thing happened with me and my best buddy 
---
A random chance? So you're on opportunistic peeper, take what you can get type deal. ^^^/s ^^^;)
---
I get that it‚Äôs designed around a fire team, but I don‚Äôt see why you absolutely must play with a team to get everything in the game.  I would be perfectly happy with a super challenging grind instead, as long as it was possible solo.
---
The thing is its so easy to fix this. As a hunter main, first nerf the living shit out of spectral blades, and then make foetracer an exact replica of oem, and give the same replica in some form for warlocks too. Can't complain about it, if every class has it. Not to mention foetracer is jack shit useless.
---
Did you bang each other‚Äôs moms?
---
As much as I love Cayde and appreciate AoS and LQ..his shader is god awful. 
---
highkey same. this and the Oxygen SR3 are the ony things i have it on (maybe gonna put it on the Memory of Cayde class armor later but that's it).
---
Only one Warlock? And **Three** Titans????? Do you REALLY need that many Melting Points?
---
It‚Äôs like s thermite hammer lol 
---
The game only has servers for two places - the tower and the farm. *Everything* else is peer to peer and there‚Äôs nothing you can do about it. 
---
Also, download speed =/= connection quality. Destiny - and any other online game - uses an insanely small amount of bandwidth. 
---
yet still has no in game LFG lol
---
hell yeah, i miss random rolls on the dead orbit, summer of solstice armor
---
The Lords of Deep once thought they would rule. Prince Crota was the first one to fall. King Oryx went to avenge his son, unsuccessful and fell. Nokris lounged in Mars and was slain like his father and brother. Xol awoke, sensing his brethren‚Äôs deaths, and attacked Rasputin, then died. 
---
They were never the gods of Hive or lords of the Deep. The Guardians, The Awoken, and the Traveler was the true gods of the Dark.
---
Sorry I gave you wrong subreddit, the good one is r/fireteams sorry for being that stupid and slow. I hope you found/will find teammates
---
Thanks killed 2 barons already 
---
I do pretty decent in comp, it‚Äôs just my teammates, they either leave or can‚Äôt get a kill.
---
what the heck man. you just described me as a destiny player perfectly
---
Gg

Thats the original movie poster, i kidd you not

Oh ok
---
At least Prime Evil sounds the same as Primeval.

Drifter calls the Envoys "awn-voys" and I hate it.

30 hours a week, I have 22. It‚Äôs too damn high

After 30+ tries I beat that strike 3 times, first 2 some blueberrys wiped the boss and ignored the knights
---
https://youtu.be/8ChT4S3T3qI
---
Ugh, I did it again!
---
To be honest it seems like you want the whole game to be your way.  I say that because there is a large portion you can solo, night falls, ascendant challenges, story missions, public events, strikes, daily heroics, forges, blind well, rumble, etc.
---
I hear that super and run like a dog hearing lightning. 
---
With respect: what the fuck.
---
the worst part was at the end, those thrals are to be feared.
---
Greenberry. Hehe
---
Ah RuneScape, an epic 15 years of my life I'll never get back, but wouldn't swap it for anything! I attended a friend's 'wedding' on there, always makes me smile over how serious people took it! 
---
This is so cool, I hope all the best for you two.
---
Oh yes. Those are the ones that made us wipe like a hundred times. But we finally got the Thorn last night. 
---
Brother he's all about shader stacks now.
---
But... That's how you say envoy... 
---
\+1
---
sometimes you wanna show off that year 1 gear, but don't wanna miss out on the awesome enhanced perks you've collected on gear
---
Does loot just appear on your screen instead of dropping? Been a while since I played.
---
Dont they go away after youve bought and completed them?
---
I have the same one by my monitor.
---
I forgot about that!!
---
I've never heard it pronounced that way... 
---
I can't tell you how palpable the irony is when I get like 10 Outrageous Fortunes out of 15 packages from Zavala and zero cores. 
---
What the hell? Who the hell pistol whips the crystal?  Even in the normal version I have NEVER seen anyone do that.  
---
So! I actually looked this up. The American pronunciation is the "ahn" whereas the British is "en"! 
---
Saw this across the street from a 7-Eleven
---
I think the problem is you're not recognising them when you see them from distance. Get a ghost with the perk that marks them for you and eventually you'll be better at finding them and won't need them any more. Also listen carefully because sometimes they're right behind you :D I been playing since 3rd week of November and deleted 2 stacks of 999 baryon bough to make room for useful things :S
---
Flashbacks to when firefly activated a bunch of times on one kill an destiny 1 and the amount of effects on screen caused the game to crash. Literally had to tell my raid groups to either unequip weapon‚Äôs with firefly, or make sure we aren‚Äôt close to each other.
---
Ikr? That‚Äôs what confused me.. 
---
‚ÄúWe ready? Great‚Äù 
---
Punches the crystal, tried to run, gets gunned down.
---
Next wipe, I shoot it while he‚Äôs standing next to it and I‚Äôm at the entrance. 
---
‚ÄúYo wtf wait for me to move‚Äù 
---
YOU DIED ANYWAYS 
---
Welp.
---
Ah, that makes sense. I guess ol' Drifter gets a pass.
---
...*This* time.
---
:'(
---
And be terrified of an attack on the city non stop? No thanks.
---
Wow this was an awesome response! I wont be able to play til Friday sadly, but would everyone be free to raid then? :)
---
Exactly what \^\^ said...UO still has some active servers and it streamed on Twitch!
---
Stupid is as stupid does I guess.
---
I went from 886 to 1100 then back down to 824 last night after joining 3 matches in a row of 2v4. I feel that little guy.
---
There you go!
---
I actually kind of like invading now that I'm better at it.
---
Only if every area was as pretty as nessus
---
Have I introduced you to my good friend Rng? He hates everyone and doesn't believe in Christmas.
---
bad idea. 
---
Players would abuse this mechanic.
---
Ah, so you're that guy who invades every thirty seconds when the Primeval is up, making me abandon a perfectly good tether shot while the whole team runs for cover. 
---
Except for timing
---
Hive seen better pun threads on this sub.
---
trap is just someone who looks female but has male genitalia. can refer to cis or trans people. it‚Äôs typically also derogatory towards trans people.
---
trans people are people who identify as something other than their birth gender. FTM means someone who was born female and identifies as male, while MTF means the reverse.
---
hope this helps
---
I got Lunas and recluse solo, but not forgotten? More like not gonna happen 
---
Does the trigger and the canister of the gun work at least?
---
He has to do something to keep us away from the annex. Still hasn't stopped me from getting schwifty with Ol' Drifty! lol
---
"Needless to say I sent the whole shipment back to Fenchurch 
---
I... what
---
This is the tactical gameplay I like to see
---
Grind is a word for laziness of the developer imo. It's what every game wants to do now and I am sick of it. I am probably sticking to single player games now, because that is all I am enjoying anymore. The game actually ENDS and you can move on to another one. Not do the same few things over and over again to unlock loot or complete "missions" that require you to redo content. Just sick of it, it's not fun. 
---
Man I miss clyde 6
---
Top one goes first. 
---
This made me HAVE SEX
---
&gt; Use your brain, friend
---
&gt; *sides with the Drifter*
---
Those two don't go together, friend.
---
No it‚Äôs fixed in place. It‚Äôs just a prop
---
 I live in America. We fear attacks every day. 
---
??? he saw you die tho ???
---
Ah. I see it now. Probably lagged enough to have like 1 health when he should have died and someone else finished him for an assist. Happens to me often enough and I don‚Äôt have garbage internet. Battlefield 4 used to do that all the time. Guy would have no health but killed me and ran off to hide and regen health.
---
It's the perk for the exotic Warlock guantlets "Getaway Artist". Let's you consume an Arc grenade to create an Arc Soul. Same as the Arc Soul you get from rifts with bottom Arc tree.
---
I've gotten so many supers that way.
---
The Vanguard's stance is to leave him alone as long as he isn't trying to undermine them. Investigation doesn't go against the wishes of the Vanguard. Shooting him would have been, but we aren't there (yet).
---
I live in America. We don't. 
---
People have gotten married cause of club penguin
---
If you look at the kill feed at the end though, I got the headshot kill, not an assist. It‚Äôs obviously just some crazy lag though
---
I have no clue man
---
There's something like that. Random valuable targets show up with raid boss icons. I can destroy them solo but it's easier with others nearby. 
---
Jackpot baby! 
---
i LOVE the new gambit prime scout. it's absolutely killer!
---
I know. This game can be glitchy as hell sometimes. I didn‚Äôt mean you got the assist. Someone else may have.
---
Glad some others agree. 
---
Coldheart.
---
Here, take mine 
---
Can confirm. Live in America. Don't fear attacks every day.
---
Escalation protocol is also good for that. You just have to get to the 7th round and also do a heroic PE at the same time. It's overwhelming. 
---
It is amazing for pvp. I'm in love with it haha
---
We have it rough out here :(
---
True.
---
My only complaint is that it shoots and kills so fast I always run out of ammo and have to switch to my kinetic primary. 
---
Thanks!! I can already hear a wet mushy sound!!
---
I‚Äôm ok with that. Remember the taken armor? That actually made it funny. These designs are bad ass. 
---
I've missed kills im crucible and Gambit because because either a full health guy drags or fuck off enemy drags my reticle 
---
The chances didn't drastically drop once Forsaken exotics were added to Xur's list?
---
I think I'm missing about 5 or 6 total, for all classes.
---
If you have a hunter, I encourage you to give dynamo a try. My  go-to Gambit build is blade barrage, ophidia spathe, hands on helmet, dynamo boots. I can basically constantly melee/dodge, both of which charge my super, so I can easily get 2, sometimes even 3 supers per round. I'm really hoping I can get +3 reaper pieces with hands on and dynamo.

Again the difference is incredibly minute up to the point where it's negligible. Don't fall for the common placebo, in most cases the perks are useless unless enhanced, where they make a notable difference due to being 2x as effective. I have Enhanced Hand Cannon Loader on my Gauntlets, with Drop Mag that's essentially free Outlaw on any reload - and it really helps slow reloaders like Duke and Thorn (not that one should ever need to reload Thorn but aye)

Just like the lore on the exotic describes it being used
---
Are you on NA PC? I can queue with you, to protect you and let you tag my targets for assists; I‚Äôm not great but I do have fabled/recluse so I might help enough to let you finish the quest.
---
Aside from how lame some heroics are compared to others, a lot of players still don't know how to trigger the heroics; I know I didn't for a *long* time. It would be helpful if Bungie gave some of that info on a loading screen, or something. I know I have to haul ass to get the heroic cryo-pod event activated before randoms

eagerly pour all their DPS into the escapee's head.

*Title*
---
Let's not start a witch hunt guys... *Signs onto playstation*
---
Ah. D1 Last Word as well. I see you are a man of culture.
---
Just use shaders to change the colours, unless some blueberry thinks you are some special wanted enemy!
---
I guess you don‚Äôt know what Zavala stands for then and what‚Äôs he has done
---
Don't worry too much about which is the best. You will have all of them eventually. Each one is good for something so you'll learn from experience and be switching them between activities all the time.
---
I‚Äôd kill for that cloak
---
Wish I could draw like that, keep doing it!
---
Thank you. Cant believe nobody else is mentioning this.
---
Look for "powerful gear" in the map screen and go for that
---
Do the allegiance quest, it gives a lot of powerful stuff, every quest STEP gives powerful rewards and each week at reset you'll get another reward
---
This how armor should be but bungie knows best
---
Thats the first thing I thought.  Damn, I have my PC settings cranked to max and I never noticed how detailed the embers flying were.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Guess I need to stop and smell the burning roses once in a while vs trying to punch everything dead.
---
What exactly doesn't work for sure though?
---
I dislike the airplane helm
---
Nolandroid is overly comical and dinklebot more somber. I remember early destiny as feeling more helpless and desperate because your ghost isn‚Äôt saying silly things every four seconds. Miss you donklebot. Can Sagira or Failsafe just be my new AI instead?
---
It looks so beautifully done! Have you done other works? 
---
Not if you hoard shaders! :D ^^somebody help me
---
Yo lex luthor dlc?
---
I deleted a second stack. I have 1k.

Service Revolver drops only from packages if you have acquired one before. If not you have to buy the fixed role from Zavala first!
---
Bruh anyone else get the lost sector discovered thing on your screen in the tower? 
---
(Screenshots RDR2) Hey look at this D2 chill spot.
---
Lol
---
Other arc buddy tricks: https://youtu.be/2mRrQSvloHg
---
Even works on tanks
---
Turned them in after acquiring the fixed roll from him just had bad rng is all
---
But atleast I got plenty of armor that I'm never going to use :)
---
It‚Äôs understandable 
---
I also live in America and I also don't fear attacks every day, but I think it's pretty insensitive to dismiss the fears of those who do. Mass shootings happen in the US on a fairly regular basis. The odds of being a victim of one are still very low, but Americans are certainly at a higher risk than the citizens of many other developed nations.
---
Instead of criticizing those who aren't able to cope with their fear as readily as you are, please try to be a bit kinder to them. Compassion and empathy are good things.
---
No, they work now
---
Thanks for taking criticism ‚ù§Ô∏è looks generally good tho
---
i wasn't around for d1 but i'd be interested in trying the racing league.  the closest thing i know of in d2 is that one part in scourge ofthe past
---
We need cabal, hive, tak...(well we kinda have that), and scorn.
---
Ya true it's the only good void type helmet 
---
QUALITY CONTENT
---
Yeah, PVP is a totally different can of worms, I‚Äôm speaking only of Gambit, and it‚Äôs ad clear potential 
---
Holy fuck! 
---
spike grenades deal extra damage on direct hits and the frame itself is part of the high damage class plus since its a grenade launcher its fire rate is pretty absurd. it out dps pretty much every other weapon but if you have a titan rally or warlock lunas i think WC and rockets with cluster still beat it out since you don't need to reload anymore.
---
And what about tether 
---
Exactly what wish would happen 
---
I know! this was the first time I have used shards in Gambit but they could be broken AF if it's constant blade barrages. This was also without any primeval stacks and I mostly melted him solo in 30s
---
I did not, his name is plain Ben on Twitter 
---
https://twitter.com/plainben/status/998560224050020353
---
Not enough arms
---
That is the worst idea. Mountaintop made me hate myself.
---
Sounds good to me, But will bungie listen?
---
Check out cabal 
---
in the words of Chibi:   YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET!!
---
It was pretty cool, now if only we can capture that vibe again in d2
---
Check out the cabal set 
---
I‚Äôm a hunter main who prefers arcstrider and gunslinger. I‚Äôve become forced to use spectral because I feel at a disadvantage if I don‚Äôt. I want t changed. I use spectral every match even though I prefer others. 
---
It has that one d1 ‚Äúhard enemies‚Äù modifier, I did it solo but hiding behind walls and being forced to do last 1/3rd of health before the big guy pounds me into the concrete was mentally draining for my 5 respawns
---
Just play warframe for awesome outfits
---
I shoot my teammates more than i do enemies anyway
---
True, just think of it as a dregs with his arms still docked but doesn‚Äôt need four like the rest of them
---
You are very right my man
---
Techincally tether isnt an ad clearning super.
---
It just helps with the supers that does the ad clearing.
---
Ita mainly used to just to make a fuck ton of orbs that just nukes everyone computers.
---
Does the exotic  work  in pvp also or its more for pve
---
Hate "yourself"? Why?
---
I was the best in it and I always wanted to have the fastest sparrow along with a suit to go with it. D1 has it so if anything bring the maps over.
---
Tell that to my Iron Fellowship gauntlets that I loved so I masterworked. I know, not the best decision but I like how they look/too stubborn to choose something else.
---
The Titan is literally wearing the Spider‚Äôs head as a helmet. It‚Äôs dope. 
---
I remember killing many supers with snipers shotguns and some exotics in one on one instances because I happened to have decent aim that time. 
---
That's me but my wife hates that I play and I definitely wouldn't have time to grind for NF or Luna's lol
---
The true power of King Crimson
---
Appreciate you dog. What does using the emblem do? 
---
You can do that on purpose with this tutorial: [https://youtu.be/xFF9JsjFGnU](https://youtu.be/xFF9JsjFGnU?list=PLimCoc8JnoM2GsJziPikYAF5lxYQrQ22x)
---
Moutaintop or that sort of trap?
---
doesn't have to even be tlw (though i was using that as well). for a while i was running around reckless using them and a sidearm and people didn't know how to act. and it's less a matter of "if" it hits shots, but more like how many. that thing is aggressive.
---
Clearly you are pvp god that never had issues getting two players together to get killed within 2 seconds with a gun that neither one shots nor reloads that fast
---
oh totally. I'm aware of all those things. But the it's really only 1 forge that you'll feel any difference and the end encounter of scourge. Both of which if you're already 650, not that big of a difference. I raid and do forges multiple times a week, I can tell you it's not that big of a deal. It's just a nice bonus so nothing to waste cores over.
---
The only thing you NEED it for is Reckoning and Prime. Even the strike is doable at 650 if you have a decent team comp. Iron banner they're introducing a new mechanic to make Power level disadvantages at least avoidable.
---
My point is, it's not worth leveling all your gear all the time. There's only select activities you need it for.
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs true. PvP is always gonna have a meta and won‚Äôt ever really be fully balanced. Yeah it seems that they nerf one thing and 2 new things come to the meta so they can never stay on top of it.
---
Most of those missions take place before he dies, so that‚Äôs why
---
Never got to skate cause I play on Console.
---
Those are some Hard Truths. 
---
That‚Äôs when you get a scrapper bounty for a Lost Sector I think
---
Honestly same here but even if you only get to play all 5 weekly games and that‚Äôs it, do it in comp and before you know it you‚Äôll have all the quest steps done. I thought the same as you but it is possible. 
---
You‚Äôre welcome 
---
I'm a hunter main, and I was using that day 1 of forsaken, when it wasn't great. I'm fine with a little more balancing, as long as they don't destroy it. It needs a little more tuning, but mostly to Gwisin vest. Here are a few personal notes. 
---
1. Gwinsin vest is 90% the problem and not the super. It's actually pretty balanced without it. This is the reason it can last so long. 
---
2. For those that say it can't be killed, teamshooting works great, the problem is with its speed and invisibility, you usually don't see it with 
---
enough time to react.
---
3. Sentinel titans with the shield block, counter no problem. This is the thing that shuts me down the most. I can try to go around, but if you keep facing me, I can't do much.
---
4. For people who say it's worse than nova warp, I have to individually target each of you to kill you, where nova warp killed everyone in the area.
---
Again, as long as it doesn't get destroyed, I'm fine with tuning, but I can always go back to arcstrider instead. The block is actually very useful.
---
Yeah, they are very good in the tie breaker round because of the increased super recharge rate. Normally you can‚Äôt get a full charge off them.
---
It can be a hard quest and I can not "Hate myself" at the same time...The whole point of the post was to highlight that it takes a long time and is difficult. I don't "Hate myself" after that long ascent, I feel accomplished. I'm sorry that you hate yourself.
---
I mean, psions are really more the brains of the cabal. They're the techno-geeks that take something apart, figure out how it works, then weaponize it
---
I mean the comment has 1 upvote, as far as I‚Äôm concerned unless it has 3 billion upvotes 4 gold 2 platinum and a Certificate of Excellence notarized by Barack Obama, Bungie isn‚Äôt paying attention
---
I want cloadless hoods, or short cloacks
---
This sub is garbage
---
Speak for yourself, he's taking me with him!
---
/s?
---
Yeah I agree w/ you about not nerfing it into the ground and having still be useable. My main problem is people just getting up close and spamming attack when you‚Äôre in your super. If I pop my hammers I have to throw 2 hammers at spectral blades before I can kill them while if they‚Äôre up next to me they can rapidly get 2 hits on me and I‚Äôm dead before I even have time to throw one hammer. 
---
You sunk the ship to kill the captain
---
Tbh, Supers are the one thing that are unrelated to RNG loot
---
I'd love to get one made out of metal and have it with the glowing red ornament from the pre-order .
---
I'll give you the add-clearing combo, but you can basically one-shot the boss with chaos reach + geomag and a melting point titan would come pretty close to that as well (I think; it's been a while since I ran into one of those in Gambit). Put the slowva bomb regen thing is amazing, especially in stuff like Reckoning.
---
That was aggressively helpful.. but helpful nonetheless. Thanks. I will look up videos and refer to them when buying a new one. 
---
The one I currently have is a SanDisk External 2TB SSD that I did buy from Amazon that was around $290 at the time if I remember correctly. It was recommended to me by a another guy I used to play with. It does use 3.0 USB which I believe is a requirement for Xbox One S to use anyway. Money isn't really an issue for me, but I just need something reliable so you gave me a place to start.
---
Always thought it was just Destiny being slow as hell. I did notice a difference in gameplay but it was marginal so I gave up trying to get a new one and deal with the loading.
---
Oh I know, tlw just already feels like easy mode to me with it‚Äôs dumb ttk with 4 body shots being better than several weapons hitting only headshots. So if you can shorten it even more it‚Äôs insane. I paired it with the recluse smg, and it cuts the ttk from .4 to ,3 seconds, it‚Äôs so crazy
---
Much like the ascendant challenges, these "Chambers" of Nessus which you access via portals are placed in free areas of the sandbox, by jumping to a spot where you can see more of the intended space you're able to look at the geometries of areas - the "tiny bow" is the Vex portal that took you into the Chamber of Water; and the cosmic ball is an environmental lighting source.
---
What I really don't understand is like...We have boss melting strats in pve. Their strength is their damage and health, so we mitigate it with buffs and stuff. The guy supering has the advantage of mobility but like...You can mitigate that with voidwalls, suppressors, smoke grenades, etc...It's not like he's flying through the air at lightspeed throwing exploding swords at you, he has to /walk there/.
---
Ok 
---
Sad
---
Thank you, I‚Äôm gonna remove the post and I‚Äôll approve the one you repost. 
---
Miss Adventure is at it again
---
If it makes you feel any better the current eververse cloak is the cloak of one of the hunters in that fireteam.
---
I want that hunter set so much
---
Fantastic! This looks like canon bungie artwork. Or a featured piece on Myelin Games's lore videos. 
---
Now do all it's ornaments. Please...
---
Drfiter. 
---
Destiny2 match making is horrible at times : (
---
Ik
---
You must've been Russian past all those enemies
---
Coming to a Eververse near you! 
---
oh man Nezaracs is pretty cool. Hopefully I can find one that has better passives (I use handcannons mostly so special ammo finder and sidearm targetting aren't the most useful. Headshots in this game are extremely easy anyway so any targetting passive is meh)
---
If this comes true I‚Äôd be proud to be a hunter main 
---
Either it ends like gerund ward or it ends like dredgen Yor
---
This is true haha
---
Nobody:
---
Spectral blades users: Your team won!
---
I honestly don‚Äôt know
---
only salt post i have ever enjoyed reading
---
+1 on this. Also, it‚Äôs impossible to get into guided games on any other raid. I‚Äôve actually only been able to get a guided game on leviathan once. 
---
I actually love this look!  I want!  I want!  I want!  :D
---
I have all those things from playing and leveling naturally. Im not sure what your complaint is? I for one am thankful everything isn't locked behind transactions as that would be the surest way I would stop playing.
---
Gotcha gotcha
---
Nah, bad idea try again.
---
That Titan helmet looks like the witch king of Angmar
---
Exactly what I‚Äôm saying
---
Hahaha this is sooo true
---
They need fresh ppl or ideas
---
1 and 3 make sense.  2 doesn't make much sense considering that playing GP and reckoning is supposed to be a cycle.
---
Run
---
I can see the titan helmet being off a bit but it‚Äôs cool 
---
Well if it‚Äôs a fallen he is dead, if it‚Äôs a guardian he will come back 
---
You must be shooting Golden Gun users
---
Got Black Talon from an exotic engram in The Reckoning yesterday. Made me happy. Been wanting that one the longest time
---
Same
---
Revive your teammate....I don't think so.
---
For real. The cloak game is weak in D2. 
---
u/simansis is a great guy
---
I'd be interested too, the one I'm in right now is deddened
---
 When everyone is trying out new guns
---
Indeed.
---
I‚Äôve never even heard of dragonfly on a auto rifle, that‚Äôs amazing! 
---
Yes, but you can only have 5 in the postmaster, so 10 total keys across your inventory and postmaster. If you get any more keys than that, they will disappear. 
---
I honestly hope they leave this sub alone. Thos community bitches more than any other I have seen. If Bungie came into here, it'd be nearly as awful as the official sub.
---
Games such as Destiny operate under a faucet and sink principle. Faucets allow players to acquire currency, sinks are places players must or can choose to spend currency. 
---
Enhancement cores are a great example of a currency with very skewed faucets. Some people have thousands because of Simseed farming. Others have almost none. The difference is almost always time.
---
 Players who can spend a lot of time playing can usually acquire a large number of cores. Players who do their core gameplay (raids/powerful engrams/weeklies) likely have very few.
---
I think one of the reasons that Bungie is so stubborn about keeping these cores as a cost is threefold:
---
 One, to add value to your preferred gear thats cap level, and diminish your ability to simply have one set and, anytime the light level increases, you do nothing but feed your higher light items into that set. They want the period of scrambling to find higher light gear and balancing your new items vs your old ones. Especially when they release new armor sets. They want you to consider your new gear, not just insta-infuse it.
---
Second, they want dismantling to have a bit more of a 'reward' to it. Getting a random legendary drop, sharding it, and getting a core, often feels good. 'Yay core!' They like, on some level, the idea that even random purple drops can be useful even if you have no interest in that weapon.
---
And third, They've talked about gameplay loops a lot recently, with regards to gambit prime. I think up until now they've very much enjoyed the scrapper bounty gameplay loop. I think they expected players to spend a lot more time chasing those bounties and perhaps didn't think them through. I think they wanted the enhancement cores to be a rare, precious resource with a real cost to using. 'If I masterwork this weapon or armor, I may not be able to infuse that godroll for a bit'. Creating the loop of: Get gear -&gt; Need Cores for infusion/masterwork -&gt; Content for cores (Scrapper bounties only currently) -&gt; Get gear while completing bounty. -&gt; Possible branching continuation. 
---
The biggest issue is when this loop falls flat. When someone has no enhancement cores and is thus made worse off for it, and has a poor gaming experience. Perhaps they can't infuse the weapon they want to use for high end content, and has less fun because their light level is low, or they have to use a weapon they dislike/is trash.
---
TLDR: Enhancement Cores are designed to be a currency with proper faucets and Sinks to allow a small gameplay loop and a bit more nuanced choice when it comes to infusion and masterworking of items. Bungie is addressing this by altering the faucet, which is needed.
---
Maybe but it couldn‚Äôt hurt for them to pull some inspiration from here
---
This sub is pretty big. Im sure they look. They just dont respond.
---
Makes sense
---
I remember thinking firmly planted was such a good perk since you get all these bonuses for crouching. But now my god the last thing I want is to be less mobile from crouching. Those bonuses aren‚Äôt stopping a nova warp or spectral blades anytime soon :.(
---
Great
---
You could team up with nova bomb users and tractor + nova bomb to kill prime evil as well.
---
Ayyy everyone keeps asking for years and bungie still hasn't delivered
---
Space banjos!!!! 
---
I'll be using it in Iron Banner all week üòÜü§£
---
True, the triumph armor would've been a perfect model. 
---
Warlock Armor ftw üòèüòå
---
Secret is out boys
---
Gotta attach a meme to it LOL
---
When you use it you can see it has flaws. Slow charge rate. Hard to hit moving enemies. If you know how to counter it is really easy to avoid.
---
I still dream or that racing scarf for my hunter
---
Saint 14 would be proud of you Guardian!
---
This is beautiful, so simple yet massive 
---
I said they should, not that they are.
---
With warlocks, just get bottom tree dawnblade, top tree nova bomb with the ‚Äúskull
---
Of dire ahamkara‚Äù exotic helmet. Those two things are so much fun to play, and you‚Äôll see why when using them.
---
With warlocks, skull of dire Ahamkara, is all I have to say...
---
