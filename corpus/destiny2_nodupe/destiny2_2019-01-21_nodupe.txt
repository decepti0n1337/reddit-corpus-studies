If the enemy has level 20s hunt them and only them but if not just sneak around to capture the points
---
---
---
And I guess that's the...*hard truth*
---
Yeah I really don‚Äôt understand why they do that with the banner. Literally makes zero sense to me other than to let bad players with high light feel like gods for a while.  The whole game is set up to make bad players feel good.  
---
honestly that‚Äôs kind of surprising, i thought they‚Äôd put you in with other low light people. are you playing by yourself or are you with a fire team of higher light people?
---
I like the pun you made (perhaps inadvertently?) in your title. 
---
myself, level 20 vanilla D2
---
Aint got nothing on my god roll blat furnace
---
Pretty sure activision being investigated for fraud played a small part in that. Because with how financial investigations usually work this current investigation was probably already being started, or at least made known to activision prior to the split. 
---
If your not max light or near max light you're just not meant to play Iron Banner.
---

---
There's no secret to it, it's just an end game pvp mode. You will get to 640-650 in time. Iron Banner comes up a whole bunch. 
---
You got the ultra rare 2k voices, a triumph so secret, Bungie doesn't even know about it
---
That event doesn't need to be heroic for the quest, so if you are not with other players who know how to make it heroic, only worry about completing the event. You'll want a crowd clearing super and a boss killing heavy weapon. Prioritize killing the scorn chieftains over all the little scorn, as long as they don't overwhelm you. 
---
Vendar, Flight of Oryx
---
I had to read it again before I understood. Yeah that was completely coincidental haha
---
Iron Banner is a temporary event and its heavily focused on light level. I think it‚Äôll be over at Tuesday weekly reset. Sorry bud. 
---
Are you missing dlc?
---
Forsaken dlc
---
I know it doesn't have to be heroic, I've read that it's easier normally. But literally every time I get on there are 3 others that appear out of nowhere right before the event starts and make it heroic.
---
Do you only have the base game? 
---
Don‚Äôt haven any DLC. Do I seriously have to spend 40 damn dollars?
---
dont forget izanagi isnt a heavy weapon so you can run that and a machine gun at the same time.
---
You need the DLC‚Äôs in order to level up beyond lvl 20
---
That‚Äôs annoying
---
Yeah
---
That‚Äôs usually what I focus on when I see level 20 and lower in public events. 
---
Nothing in life is truly free. $40 is cheap. Support bungie, you obviously appreciate all their hard work and effort
---
That's how rng works
---
Don't get me wrong I love it, I'm the guy who will run Jade, Polaris, niflheim and more just cause especially in crucible üòÇ
---
That‚Äôs my permanent loadout now. It‚Äôs almost feels perfect 
---
Everything that changes how the game plays can be picked up by anyone within the game, nobody spawns in with an advantage
---
Too broke. Bungee will have to wait I guess
---
That's why. The expansions raised the lvl cap multiple times since original launch. Consider getting the Forsaken dlc. It includes a lot (not all) of the content and you should be able to find it cheap. It's worth $30 bucks if you're enjoying the game so far
---

Yes they're still independent of each other and have been since before the Vivendi split 6 years ago. The CEOs meet at the end of each quarter with the heads of Activision Blizzard Inc to go over financial reports before they present it to investors. That's it. With the exception of Battle.net, Activision Publishing Inc's operations are completely separate from Blizzard Entertainment's. Diablo Immortal was 100% Blizzard.
---
Saying Activision had a say in Diablo Immortal is like like saying 2k had a say in RDR2. Same parent company with completely separate operations.
---
Alrighty, thanks man.
---
Lol I dont think that its Bungie that will have to do any waiting
---
Cheers. Have fun

Touch√©
---
This isn‚Äôt your personal advertising forum, get out.
---
Ah a man of culture 
---
Ya im not buying it. 
---
I can agree with that. It can be a frustrating strike because of the modifiers if the game decides to be on one especially. 
---
Like 30. 
---
It‚Äôs 60 if you‚Äôre not already fabled and 40 if you are, from what I‚Äôve read 
---
Kinda trailed off at the end there.......üòâ
---
from no dlc pleb to no dlc pleb i guess
---
I think they should implement community creations and sponsor the creators.
---
Similar to how CS:GO does weapon skins.
---
Badlander? Really? More like Ikelios or Dust Rock Blues. 
---
I personally think that the Malfeasance is a subpar pvp weapon, and a poor pve exotic.
---
:X
---
Activision Blizzard Inc. isn't Activision Publishing Inc. This what no one is understanding.
---
Activision Blizzard Inc. is a holding company. They aren't the Activision that makes games. That's Activision Publishing Inc. 
---
Yes Blizzard Entertainment Inc. And Activision Blizzard Inc. meet regularly. But Activision Publishing Inc. and Blizzard Entertainment Inc. (the companies that actually publish the games) only meet a few times a year.
---
The changes at Blizzard have been the result of the CFO of Activision Publishing Inc. being moved over to Blizzard Entertainment Inc by Activision Blizzard Inc.
---
If you do that's awesome. Sweet made even sweeter with the removal of Activision from the equation.
---
You disagree with me and you called me a dick. I disagreed with you and said you should bank more motes. Sorry if I made you mad but there is a lot of people that camp at portals and do not contribute at all to the team. I'm not saying that you dont contribute I'm just saying you could do what you did while getting 30+ motes.
---
ive been having great fun with it in crucible
---
I must be the only one that thinks a destiny BR would be awesome ...
---
Don't forget The Fanatic!
---
So, what's the God roll on this?
---
I have feeding frenzy and kill clip. 
---
Enter the gungeon is fun but I still can't git gud
---
Guess I was wrong 
---
Do you play a lot of Gambit/PVP or/and a fan of using hand cannons? If yes to one or both, its very worth it and [its ornament](https://i.imgur.com/Bq8R9tY.jpg) is pretty sexy
---
Nooo, just messin. Good day buddy
---
Hey don't cry,he is gone but never forgotten .
---
As a publicly traded company, they are first and foremost required to take actions that show the most potential profit. This results in pushes towards the latest trends and mobile games that investors see as prime earning real-estate. This wouldn't be so bad if Blizzard was a solitary studio like CD Projekt, as they would directly speak to investors in that case to reassure. But the situation Blizzard is in, they report to a higher group of management who has expectations of Blizzard and direct influence on the paths they take. 
---
Yes at the end of the day, Blizzard could still choose to do what is best for their core audience instead of the expectations of ActiBlizz, but that would mean greatly risking their relationship with them as well and being dropped, so they tried to play a more "safe route" and but executed it poorly. People are upset because it's very likely if the buyup had never happened then they'd likely have made slightly better decisions over the past few years.

Nice! I've only got 1 @ 650, the other two are close though. Definitely a challenge for anybody working/going to school full time!
---
Exactly, it's the only light enabled pvp. It's nice to have a reason to be max light. Because otherwise why does being max light matter. I dont understand why you are mad about light level mattering in this one event. It's the only event that does this and its been this way since D1. As a hobbyist player I would be livid if they took light level mattering out of iron banana.
---
I hate when you're trying to make the walker one heroic but there's that one dipshit with the last charge just walking around with it
---
Yep its perk is even strong enough to counter Thunderlord in pvp and Gambit if you land the first hit
---
Sadly a ‚Äúvote to kick‚Äù system could be easily exploited with only three players in a fireteam for strikes, and nobody ever goes AFK in Crucible (or rather, it‚Äôs not as common in Crucible).
---
A raid were we have to board Ghaul‚Äôs ship and ast the end everyone gets their supers really quick because the traveler is so close and giving us the strength to kill Ghaul... main I wish
---
That's the thing I don't know found it on pinterest but there was no artist citation there .Can't even find the post any more .someone in the comments said it was taken on the realise of destiny 2 and remembers seeing the cosplayer .

How long was this happening
---
Well done Guardian !

RIP Cayde üò•
---
Ah yes, my favorite character, destiny 
---
What is to be gained by this?
---
It's hard to not like him haha
---
i think he tries to complete his weekly bounties with this
---
If your interest in story and lore then yes, PvP is an option but it is mainly for the those who like the pew pew rather than a primary story developer. There are still 2 more confirmed seasons coming and each spans 3 months. You will hit 650 and be able to enjoy end-game content in no time 
---
I hope so, loved Taken King!
---
Id wait until after the next dlc/season.  Things are dying down again, right now. 
---
‚ÄúYou can put your rocks on my map now. I don‚Äôt need ‚Äòem anymore ‚Äú

**ALRIGHT ALRIGHT ALRIGHT LET'S SEE WHAT WE GOT:**
---
**DUST ROCK BLUES ON THE HORIZON!**
---
Nope.   No changes. Just good rng
---
Didn‚Äôt take me too many tries either. Only maybe 6 or so frames
---
I‚Äôd always been anti endgame bc I don‚Äôt want to be the guy mucking it up for everyone, holding people back. It was awesome to get thru it with a new group w/ a sherpa. Dude was super helpful, and no one really felt like they were messing up anymore than the rest of us lol
---
Comp or qp/IB?
---
There's a lot of lore and story to catch up on if you're into to that, but you don't need to be to enjoy this game. You can level up to 600 pretty quick. 
---
Why would you NOT draw it with the Colonel ornament? üòë
---
Anything that can reward you with DC weapons I guess, can't remember precisely if the adds in patrol area ever dropped DC weapons or random junk
---
I just want to explore and hear a decent story. I'm not big into the mechanics of an mmo or end game etc. 
---
I got Outlaw/Kill Clip on my first try. Haven't been paying attention to the other stats, just been enjoying my little slice of luck.
---
Anyone want to explain?
---
I see you haven‚Äôt gotten Clan Night. I wish to inform you that finding people to do said Triumph, is one of the most stressful ventures you‚Äôll encounter
---
We will not return to the dreadnaught in d2 as stated by bungie so maybe in D3 or maybe never who knows.
---
What should I read?
---
Sorry, yes! This exactly.
---
Just for your third question. I believe you were in a public patrol zone. Each planet has a patrol zone where you will match with other people and can explore around the entire planet and kill ever-respawning enemies. You can tell it's a public area if you're matched with other people during a mission, these areas will have enemies that don't stop respawning.
---
Nope, I sadly do not have that.
---
I've had hazard for a while but I was going to dismantle it today but I instead decided to look out up first and apparently it's pretty decent
---
I found out when I got the borealis catalyst 
---
Wow nailed the pose- I can hear him telling Ace he‚Äôs coming home. Can we make a Destiny theme park like Disney World, please.
---
I also got the Triumph "Nessus Black Armory Smith," even though I got it at the EDZ. I was crossing my fingers for Jotunn and got Le Monarque instead, on my first forge of the day, but isn't it not even supposed to drop here?
---
And now to wait something like 3 months to get one of the shitty LEGENDARY cosmetics to drop so you can finally get the title.
---
Great cosplay. A chicken would've been a better choice companion, but that's just me being nit-picky.
---
Ya, it's normal, Jotunn drops at bergusia forge, off of powerful frames of course 
---
Actually I just re read this and no what the fuck, do you mean bergusia? 
---
Hey handsome, you're supposed to be dead.
---
Yep, it dropped at Bergusia.

I just got mine today and hooooo boy does it feel good to use.

I really appreciate this post :). Sadly I play on Xbox so I won't be any help to you but I wish you luck finding teammates! Maybe destiny LFG could help? It's a subreddit and there are multiple websites dedicated to it as well. 
---
Emphasis on try
---
The only problem us the xboxes and not PC's;)
---
Nah burn it with every exotic you own and spend the bright dust on shaders you mildly like. 
---
In addition to the app, you can find people on /r/fireteams, this subreddit's discord (not super lively, linked in the top right), or the /r/destinythegame discord (linked in their sidebar). 
---
Depending on what platform you are on, you could use the PC LFG  discord server (lfg = looking for group, join link: https://discord.gg/WaaTMz requires link previews enabled in discord settings), the built in xbox function that lets players find each other, or /r/FireteamsPS4 
---
Yeah just try doing all 10 or so 
---
Yep they call me the salt flats kid. Nah im sorry that went too far. But i love this game alot and theres other ways of fixing the game than making the guns that are suppose to be over powered, useless. Again apologies.

I'd try any of the LFG apps or websites.  I've met plenty of friends that way that I've been playing with since D1! I hardly ever log into Destiny anymore without hitting up my friends list or checking LFG. It requires very low effort with tons of rewards. 
---
Stole a game too in a game called Gear Up a while back. I was playing in a match that was similar to control and the match was almost over. The enemy team was about to win but my team was really close behind. It was then that I noticed that the zone I was by wasn't fully captured so I got on it and we won the game.
---
Why do people care so much about Reddit karma? Honestly wondering. Thanks.
---
Yup not to mention orchid is gofannon.
---
Only character that I like in destiny 2 and he has to die. Kill stupid zavalla or something.
---
x to doubt

God shards from ranking uptoday, so i can finally just  be happy to take whatever from xur!

for a second i thought this was actually the game, but then i remembered that's impossible because Cayde is dead.
---
now i'm sad, great cosplay though. (‡≤•Ôπè‡≤•)
---
Orange Bars counts too, iirc. I picked up my Draug super late, and did the quest by farming the Gofannon forge a bit with it.
---
Feeding kill clip is just a better version of outlaw kill clip is it not? Gives a bit more leniency for long distance kills which blast furnace does exceptionally well for a pulse with its good stability and exceptional range.
---
Report him?
---
A friend of mine got it from a Kalli completion two days ago. 
---
Why would you stay in for 3 games with someone botting?
---
Yknow, I‚Äôll throw the bone I‚Äôm throwing a lot of people, a friend opened his clan to the public(like the absolute buffoon he is) and you may as well contact him about it. Rathalos #11303 is his battle tag
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it happens everywhere. For me, it happens every time I ADS after stacking 4 rounds 
---
I have a subtle calamity with explosive head, it's pretty strong at taking down shields from afar, or killing mobs
---
It's honestly pretty strong. 
---
Got that the in the first challenge in the Shattered Throne. Didn't realize how rare they were 
---
The issue here is how many of the exotics would interact with each other. As is there are combinations with things like oathkeepers and monarque that have incredibly synergy, but if you then give a nightstalker both graviton forfeit and gwinsim best you‚Äôve created a major problem where they can abuse way too many things. Needless to say, the exotic limit is incredibly important in not absolutely destroying the game for everyone. 
---
You have no idea how many Ships I‚Äôve seen drop from others on my fireteam except for me 
---
* what raid?
---
* what encounter?
---
* what was your role?
---
We really need answers to those to be of much help. Different boss encounters require different ranges, different mechanics and different approaches. 
---
But: your loadout screams add clear. Ikelos is only really viable for boss damage if your whole squad is running it from very close range. Thunderlord is incredibly versatile but it too isn't really intended for straight boss damage. Sunbreaker is used primarily for Melting Point, not damage output.
---
Hang in there. I'm sure you'll get it soon. 
---
RNG ive cashed in tokens an gotten four snipers in a row then a pair of boots 
---
I did it with Better Devils and Swift Ride. I know I can't beat other people with Lunas at \~1900 so I play long distances and to avoid getting shotgunned.

How are people supposed to know that you can trigger heroic events?  It's amazing how angry people get, but I never saw anything that told players they could trigger heroic events.

Just leveled my warlock from scratch and played through the entirety of the game ina day and a half.. gotta say CoO is not that bad. Sure the story is lame but y not just knock it out.. took like 40 mins lol.

Keep an eye out for rocket launcher with impact casing/clusterbombs. Some can have tracking added to that too (bad omens curated, zenobia-D, SotP RL). Also do not underestimate the field prep perk for pve.
---
For the puppieeeeeeeeeeeeeeees!!
---
Anything with cluster bombs in a lunafaction rift, or behind a rally barricade is good, just unload everything you have at once and clean up with whatever you have left 
---
Prepare for trouble, and make it double
---
Got mines from speed running nightfalls
---
If you're talking about crucible, I'm pretty sure light level (power level) is all the same across all guns. But some guns are a lot stronger than others and you might want to try obtain the ones in meta. 
---
This is on my main character, still a lot to grind for tho
---
Its pretty good. Allthough the perspective you've chosen is tricky, but not faulty. Im not sure how to explain in english, but it seems like you've used a reaaaally big gun and looked on it from the middle of the barrel as reference. Your drawed persepective might be correct, but on paper, atleast this drawing, it seems a bit off. (we see the front of the handle, but not the front of the barrel, muzzle). As a drawer you're aloud to cheat a bit on perspective to make it easier to look at for the "untrained" eye. Otherwise, a great drawing. How long did you spend on it? Do you have any more?

What does the dlc have to do with heroic events? There‚Äôs still a few public events that I don‚Äôt know how to turn heroic.
---
Good for you, I still have all 3 dlc campaigns and a lot of heroic public events to get to level 50
---
Hey that's what makes the interesting because there can be a lot of diverse opinions on characters and loreüòä
---
Some of them didn't suffer from stupid hunters exotic in year 1

So youre stuck huh
---
We had to leave and relaunch the mission. I was helping a friend finish the warmind campaign. Luckily the checkpoint was at the boss fight.
---
... are you serious? 
---
Yeah, it's really annoying. The thing is it only glitches in the story version.
---
Because it's there canonically.
---
I'd advise you to the gambit rocketlauncher. It  has  Aggressive Frame-&gt; "High damage" with boss spec mod.
---
Sad

I'm still looking for a weapon that's gonna be my favourite one. So far I'm mainly using Better Devils, but I'm getting more and more tired of it.

But your Misfit looks pretty nice. Even though I don't really use auto rifles, this one seems worth looking into!

Gambit pug is cringe. Lost 3 games in a row just now. People die to adds way too much. List can go on. Just had to share my frustration somewhere. This game is the only thing that can infuriate me to no end. 
---
Not at all! We are more than willing to show you the way of heroic events and much more! Feel free to ask!
---
Tell that to the 3 stack clan that was constantly wrecking me and my friend as I was helping him with a quest.
---
Kills plus assists. Not just guardians you've had a killing blow on.
---
So after you complete the main story, and your drops "level out", and all seem to be the same kind of level, you have hit the *soft cap*.
---
At this point you want to focus on activities that give you **Powerful Engrams** as rewards, indicated by milestones on your Director.
---
There are weekly and "daily" ones (not exactly daily, but there's a new one every day, for the most part, spread across 3 activities).
---
Doing these every week will speed up levelling, as well as your random chances for a **Prime Engram** to drop from enemies in the game world.
---
The Milestones are usually strikes, crucible (PvP), the nightfall strike, Heroic story Missions and a Flashpoint (activities on a certain Planet, this week it's Titan, until Tuesday). There are more details available on the director.
---
Really? You‚Äôd of thought a giant RGB bird would be hard to miss 
---
I think you meant to say Crucible.

And that too üòÇ

They are shown with the lmg. There is an effect like on the images when you shoot them but nothing yet discovered I think.
---
It will affect the duration of whatever weapon is being shown on screen. If you have HC dexterity and switch weapons, it will put it away faster. If you switch to it, it will ready it faster and slightly increase its ADS
---
Why does this trigger everyone so much?
---
Cool now buy the expansions
---
Yes, please do! I've never heard of the Midnight Coup, but with 30k+ on it, it must be a good gun!
---
You didn't say that, might want to add that to the post
---
Titan - Superman
---
Armor: Skullfort - Synthoceps - Heart of Inmost Light - Dunemarchers
---
Weapon: Ace of Spades - J√∂tunn - Thunderlord
---
IMO they should use the Infinite Forest and make a bunch of dungeons for us to do. Since it's all simulations, give us simulations of old D1 raids repurposed into dungeons. Every week, a different raid has become a dungeon. Vault of Glass, Crota's End, King's Fall, and Wrath of the Machine.
---
But you still loose points on defeat right? So there is no guaranteed ‚Äúslow but steady‚Äù-method?
---
"Embrace the darkness" the drifter said lol
---
Its says right there "for leaving competitive matchmaking"
---
Congratulations! You are the Moon Master!
---
Its a handcannon from the Leviathan raid with Outlow and Rampage as currated rolls. Its a god weapon. Must have when you love to play with handcannons.

Yeah you do.¬†Sadly comp isn't skill, it's luck + "how well can I balance my wins vs my losses".

Officially, when I checked back on destiny tracker, it said we won.
---
But we aren‚Äôt talking about snipers....
---
It does, arc abilities, however crown doesn't extend it, it gets it back faster.
---
Is that Outlaw and Rampage I see on there? Such a good combo on any type of rifle IME. I'll have to look up this Chattering Bone weapon too now!
---
Crown doesn't affect the length..
---
I'd be fine with that if only it weren't useful for PvE, the mode I want to play in.
---
Forcing people into PVP for quests like this only serves to lower the overall quality of PVP matches.  
---
Better than year 1 crucible tbh
---
Titan.
---
It's a wonder why the game even allows the other two classes to even have access to PvP.

Nah i wish they did but they all had dupes in their inventory. One guy in our clan has three of them already. No luck for me, though

Uhhhh

Depends entirely on your playstyle and loadout

Trust me, I have it, it is pretty ineffective in pve

holy shiet that was sick! Do you use different rifles for different playmodes or do you have two favs you switch between? anyway a really nice montage

Can we wait until splitting from your primary source of funding is actually a good idea that worked out?
---
Great Job!
---
What titan subclass? 
---
Platform? Which strike?
---
I'm 635.  There is nothing in the game that mentions this.  I just learned about it a week or so ago out of blind luck on YouTube.  
---
If I wasn't invested enough to watch videos, I'd never have known.  I rarely had anyone turn an event heroic until recently.
---
Afaik it's supposed to be kind of a secret, otherwise the game would direct you to do those things, just like it does with the rules of the event itself.
---
This isn't an LFG sub.

Certainly, the fact they have not straight up said no is very telling and hopeful. It just is important to remember and understand SRL just was not as popular as it seems to have been. Many players who talk about it now might very well have played 3 rounds and called it quits, and are now looking in nostalgia on something they never really utilized in the first place.
---
If you watch her for long enough she actually puts something in the pan and messes with it a bit

Did you ever get the emblem?

I still haven't been able to obtain it from Shaxx or Collections.

I took a 2 month break from D2, came back yesterday.  Played a few strikes, decided to knock down some crucible bounties in.  3 games later, after an endless parade of sliding shotgun titans, I've uninstalled.
---
Shhhhh that's a secret
---
I had a guy similar to this. His character would walk forward a few feet, spin in a 360, melee, throw a grenade (when it was charged), and then walk backwards and stop at his original staring position before doing it all again. I reported him and also sent him a few choice words.

Swap the spade for the colonel

for future reference, i dont think you need to specify that the sunglasses are black..
---
I find it hard to believe that making a racing activity (total asset cost: one or two models for checkpoint flags, start line, finish line, and a pop up screen at the end listing how fast everyone finished) is somehow twice as expensive as making a strike.  I'm sure something like the mount races in GW2 would go over pretty well.

It appears you are asking a question about LFG/Clans, or help in-game. 
---
Please post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/89vbwr/official_lfg_megathread_version_20/?sort=new) instead, look at the LFG dropdown menu on the top bar of the subreddit for various LFG tools, or check the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/8ji06r/official_faq_please_read_before_posting/) for possibly helpful advice on how to find people to play with our advertise/find clans.

---
This, I've been running a SMG/fusion rifle combo due to getting the scourge fusion curated. It's a blast seeing someone that thought they were going to shotty you only to see them dissolve
---
Not only was it the only expansion at the time CoO was the only expansion for 5 months. No matter what the annual pass releases are like atleast it's something new to do every 3 months. 
---
I literally just got my shell yesterday, that's easily the longest part of the title 
---
I‚Äôd say hunter with spectral blades and gwisin vest
---
I get more motivated to play crucible the more I've already played it.  
---
But now that I don't need powerful drops I never play it
---
That seems to be the general thing. I might do
---
Destinysets.com is a good site and should show what is in his loot pool. 
---
Really? I land critical shots consistently in PvE, so its perk looked ideal for it.
---
Is it really skill to just scroll the wheel like crazy though?
---
Using bunny hops, strafe jumps and rocket jumping back in the game took skill to use and utilize effectively.
---
Nope, it's BEYOND an auto rifle once you do the rapid fire exploit... 
---
The minute I see a chicken on it I‚Äôll die a happy man
---
Because Bungie is leaving Activision and this guy thought of a funny pun he wanted to share. Idk what's to get. 
---
I usually would melee as Hunter, there's a couple frames inthe animation where there is absolutely nothing on screen.
---
[removed]
---
And Nathan Fillion.
---
The hologram arrows are an exotic called Orpheus Rig, and Xur had them last week I believe. 
---
As far as cool Hunter gear? Vanguard Dare from eververse is cool. You'll get it from bright engrams. The Gambit cloak is nice, as is the Tangled Shore cloak. The Iron Banner helmet is awesome this season. And all of the Prodigal armor set looks pretty great on hunters.
---
But it really is all about the shaders. Get some good shaders. üëå
---
Not particularly. Non dlc owners just don‚Äôt have access to weapons that are specifically from activities added by dlc. 
---
They can get any of the same random drop stuff or gear from the main game and the equip requirement is fully dependant on what power level it drops at which, outside of some crucible gear that drops high for whatever reason, should be capped so that they can equip it. The random loot drop table gets updated for everyone whether you get the dlc or not. Anyone can get that gear. This includes random drop exotics as well. 
---
And if you talk crucible pvp, other than in the iron banner, level advantages are disabled and all damage is equalized. The main advantage that level 50s would have in there is just that they‚Äôve had more time to build an Arsenal they like and get armour with perks to suit. 
---
Legendaries generally don‚Äôt start dropping until level 20 but once you hit that point, the rate of getting them and quality of them don‚Äôt really change at all. 
---
There is plenty of top tier gear that a level 20 person without the dlc can get just as well as anyone else. 
---
PC here sadly.
---
It may have changed since last I tried but you can Titan skate without using a script pretty well, just not perfectly like with a script. 
---
Okay I assumed prediction was the main reason as well but since people on my ‚Äúskill‚Äú level hardly move unpredictable or dodge much I thought that I probably just panic and potatoe my shots.
---
I didn't know PvE has higher Aim Assist though...
---
That might be it
---
I stopped using blade barrage, but I try to use weapons that no one will call me toxic for. Basically it‚Äôs a counter for myself against shotguns
---
That's exactly what goes through my head right after I dispel a shadow rift and pick up a relic sword in Escalation Protocol. 
---
I‚Äôve never really looked at the design- I was all about stats. 
---
However, I now have a bird on my arm and stats be damned
---
Wait, Crowder is Canadian? Fuck, bad enough I have to share my province with that embarrassment of a psychologist Jordan Peterson.
---
There's this one person I've come across on  level 50 for the crucible free for all. They are able to use this rocket gun and it's not a heavy weapon. Might be a special weapons but I'm not entirely sure as the person was able to use it a lot 
---
Just waiting for that, but it‚Äôs been a grind.... üíÄ
---
I don't believe so. I think forsaken is required
---
My Year 1 [Better Devils](https://i.imgur.com/zQ7cwkR.png) prolly still has my highest on a single gun with over 26 thousand kills. Back then it was the best thing ever, now it's just kinda sitting in my vault sadly.
---
The thing I find most fun about the game in general is playing around with the unique guns. Even if don't stick to using one for a while because I don't like it as much, I have fun experimenting with them.
---
It irks me to have to play a part of the game I really don't enjoy to get to something I actually want to. Especially when it's not something you eventually can learn, but are just always at the mercy of what random strangers happen to be playing.
---
I'm on pc btw
---
I run a Duke in IB except on Midtown and Equinox where I run a pulse. I do just fine.
---
Wouldn't call whisper a result of rng, but otherwhise it's looking good for you on the lady luck department
---
I mean personally I don‚Äôt even think t was challenging back then - maybe that‚Äôs just because I had an experienced PvE team though, but surely you agree that the mechanics are pretty lame.
---
Some of y'all didn't play enough Mario Bros and it shows.
---
I'm happy the Destiny community is positive about Bungies future. It will make their spectacular shit show even more enjoyable.
---
Liveleak.
---
I usually just stand there and accept my iminate death. 
---
I'd be really surprised if they decide to abandon an entire playerbase of pc players who don't own a console or just prefer the controls via keyboard and mouse
---
I dont want to change is mind though 
---
So when they get to their lowest point they come springing back...?
---
Eh, as someone with over 200 hours in comp, a 68 winstreak, got mountaintop one week into the expansion, and spend time testing out dozens of different loadouts...
---
This is kinda just false. Mathematically there are very much weapons that will excel and others that will not. That doesn't mean there isn't a time and place for most things, but saying there isn't a meta is just foolish.
---
Why do you want it? I've broken down 20 at least, seems like a turd
---
Got my Outlaw + Rampage Orchid the other day. I put a Rampage mod on and i love it.
---
Dude, curse of Osiris was actually fun for me, blasting through all that vex. So easy to get precision kills with my beautiful better devils on them. Using annual skate for that outlaw reload time rn.
---
WHO IS YOUR DADDY AND WHAT DOES HE DO
---
There is a skill to scroll wheel skating. Doesn't have anything to do with killing. Just regulating how fast you scroll based on the angle of terrain you're on and learning to platform with skating takes some time to get used to. 
---
The hive and their shriekers are much worse to me. I like getting scorn and cabal. Vex and Hive, if they have their shriekers, not so much. 
---
must have high latency... it's all about who presses the trigger first + latency
---
So what is the alternative that you would like to provide?
---
Just use sunshot. The explosive damage is better for clearing adds in pve.
---
And ace of spades is probably just as good as LH in pve for the majority of encounters. 
---
Then get called out by apes for using a "no skills" weapon LMAO
---
Telesto*
---
One. 
---
Cluster Bombs is not Wolfpack Rounds. Which even got nerfed. RIP. 
---
Yes. 
---
Yea maybe in QuickPlay but you've most likely never played in 5500 Glory or Scrimmed at all because shotgunning actually does take skill at high level play
---
Yeah I think that‚Äôs correct
---
[Uhh I beg to fuckin' differ there, buddy](https://gfycat.com/DemandingEsteemedAfricanparadiseflycatcher)
---
...you‚Äôre running a game on an external drive that could be pulled out/fail/disconnected from windows at any moment? This might be the root of your issues. Should‚Äôve opted to put a secondary drive internally. Spinning drives are cheap, probably could‚Äôve got it for the same price/cheaper than that external. 
---
I'm new to destiny 2, I did play the first one but was usually always solo. Is there a place where I can look to add others to team up with? I play on the ps4.
---
You mean the quote that's been incorrect for ages?  That one? :P
---
Then something is messed up with game because I have broken down multiple masterworks without getting a core
---
Yup. Especially as I can hear the enemy frantically smashing his melee swing as I skate away from. It‚Äôs about 50/50 if I make it or not. If I do, I turn around telesto his ass!
---
Imagine being this desperate for attention. 
---
ah, wasn't it bugged on the drop anyway or something? I remember hearing it was actually scheduled to release the same time as J√∂tunn
---
Oh wow your so cool, you‚Äôre good at Photoshop we get it
---
Well if you're trying to utilize those perks to the fullest then you will need to have a Kinetic to synergize with. Other than that Disruption Break is a wasted perk.
---
Hadn't heard anything about that, Bungie confirmed on their twitter about the drops for each one, seemed pretty accurate each time.
---
Great synergy, maybe it‚Äôd be good for Gambit, but overall for a primary weapon you want damage multiplying perks like Rampage, Surrounded, or Kill Clip, or a reload perk like Outlaw or Feeding Frenzy
---
Hurr hurr. Destiny dumb. Miss bungie jumping joke so dumb. Hurr. 
---
I got my bow from banshee, don't have forsaken (yet)
---
I got to Heroic 2 on my own then had a buddy of mine que up with me so we can finish up.  Most of it was done solo though.  It was horrible lol.  
---
You‚Äôll get there man and thanks!
---
Thats kinda what I was thinking but I didnt know if someone else had a better idea.
---
What is ‚Äúcool‚Äù can be very opinionated. I personally play exclusively warlock and love it. I have party utility, boss burn, and add clear options. And some good roaming options for pvp.
---
Bungies is know for creativity, I‚Äôm just assuming that Activision is the reason obviously. But considering Eververse is their micro-transaction merchant it would make sense.
---
So this is how you make friends?
---
Meyrin RDL, SATOU Precision Lens are the scopes.
---
Drop mag and extended mag.
---
Reload speed masterwork. 
---
Yeah I'm thinking it's a pretty good roll, hopefully I can get this lucky on my kindled orchid next time I try to grind it. 
---
Yes there are theories that's what the room is for. 
---
Prime Engrams start dropping once you hit lvl 50 iirc
---
I'd take Activision over a Chinese mobile game company any day 
---
Jokes on you, I can‚Äôt aim for shit
---
Feeding frenzy/Rampage is amazing in PvE with a rampage spec mod.
---
That's a really good roll. One of the better ones with the available perks. My god roll would have at least zen moment on it. If you slap a rampage spec on that thing it'll be even better 
---
Thanks! I'm missing Spiteful fang and Tyranny of Heaven.
---
Yo! I can refer you if you didnt find anyone. Im on xbox as well.
---
Thank you!
---
I'll definitely be working on proportions and perspective. That's the general feedback I've been given. 
---
This sub has definitely been kind. I was expecting hateful comments but every comment I've got was constructive and kind.
---
So again, thank you.
---
its not broken at all
---
Use a shotgun, they have better range 
---
As you can see warlocks have the most graceful and glorious jump there is
---
Yeah dreaming city, if its week 3 then the story mission has a few easy ones
---
thats a terrible idea. swords have no chance against shotguns.
---
I was the resident Aegis wielded for my clan. Good Times.
---
The fact that random rolls is the first thing you think of illustrates just how lazy and terrible they are.
---
Warlock has the most variety of options to have fun while being effective (all of their super are great)
---
Hunter has some nice one
---
u must not be past 100 glory
---
But at what cost?
---
They are buffing a lot of supers next week on the 29th. That might change what ppl think/use today.
---
While we are talking about skil [sic], I'd like to take a moment to thank all of the bosses for being so big that I can no-scope them with my sniper rifle.  Evolutionary pressure would suggest that having a smaller hit box and moving constantly would be advantageous, but that is not what we observe.  So thanks again, bosses, for being giant lumbering bullet sponges.
---
Did I though? Because with fixed rolls, you will always see weapon 4 over weapon 7, with the game as it is now, I see different weapons used all the time. It makes for a much more enjoyable experience if you actually play the game
---
Upvote for honesty, lol.
---
I have the curtain call one from Warmind. Perfect to be that guy when waiting in Gambit.
---
Yes, cluster bombs work so well because Riven is giant, and if you shoot them inside her mouth all the cluster bombs directly hit, so it does way more damage than anything else. This includes Thunderlord, Whisper of the Worm, and Prospector. Though if you do not have any rocket launchers with cluster bomb, I have heard Prospector works. 
---
Thanks! I made them with my wife‚Äôs Cricut machine. Found the parade emblems online and went to dafont.com and downloaded ‚Äúfuturist fixed‚Äù which is the closest thing to the destiny font I could find. 
---
Why don't you learn to use fucking Google and shut the fuck up... entitled shits again...
---
You can try /r/Fireteams, /r/FireteamsPS4, the official Destiny 2 app, this subreddit's discord server (link in top right) or the /r/DestinyTheGame discord server (link in their sidebar). 
---
Haha. That‚Äôs actually me. You might have to join up to know the story behind that one. 
---
Only on PC..üòë
---
Both are trash üòé
---
Your original argument was they made Halo but the Halo people moved on.
---
You‚Äôre just looking to shit in Activision and praise Bungie when the latter is still to blame for a lot of the issues. 
---
It‚Äôs funny you mention Call it Duty and Battlefront when they fucked everything D1 had and ignored it when D2 launched. It was the *same game* as vanilla Destiny. 
---
Bungie really fucked that up. 
---
Hallowfire Heart isn‚Äôt a Forsaken exotic, but congrats on getting two drops! 
---
Thanks!!! I‚Äôve been wanting to do something like this for my clan when we host events with prizes. I‚Äôll have to look into getting one. I‚Äôm sure your friends will love it.
---
Is that a sick joke? Random rolls make the game even more monotonous haha without fixed rolls to provide balance, EVERY one chases the same OP weapons. It's the worst state crucible has ever been in, it's so boring
---
Was thinking about the Aegis Shield the other day and realized that it was an early version of the Sentinel Shield for Titans
---
There's also the problem where Dice is a subsidiary of EA and not simply on contract. The studio cannot leave EA without EA selling it off.
---
Try to support your team more.
---
Thank you. I‚Äôm very excited! Be careful with that cricut machine, it can easily become a new obsession. So many cool things to do. 
---
There are a few lost sectors in the dreaming city that have a jumping skip that take you right to the final mini bosses
---
You are right!
---
You need multiple headshots for this, it would be effective vs bosses. But in pvp I‚Äôd choose outlaw over this anytime.
---
