When withdrawing from collection, exotics are below light. Significantly I might add. And I‚Äôm pretty sure the Exotics you get through story rewards are light level locked. I know my Doomfang Pauldrons didn‚Äôt break 150 when I got them despite me being almost 200 at the time.

Midnight Coup. I have 12,000 kills with it. I got a stability Masterwork on mine which is great because I a spazz.
---
I went from 8k to reset in about 4 hours.  We had a long streak or two.  Best bet is to find others that wanna grind and stick together.
---
Congrats on getting the title! I know the pain all too well. I haven't gotten horror's least yet or the Morgeth egg but I'm working on it. Soloed the shattered throne quite a few times for the ship and eventually got lucky.
---
when you got stomped, i almost had a heart attack
---
Thanks mate
---
No problem my guy
---
not sure if woooosh or not but it‚Äôs an Exotic
---
Microtransactions are inevitable.
---
lol just a lame joke about never seeing them drop anymore.
---
Use nezarac sin and recluse when the match starts, you'll have your super before 30 motes are in. Switch to skull and rek shop from there on
---
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH NOOOOOOOOOOO
---
yea but exotics dont let you save the engram anymore unless that his postmaster. my thought was that it was a really old exotic drop from year 1 and since their predetermined it vary well could be if thats the case.
---
but honestly i ment it as a joke lol
---
Is that.. the mythical... exotic engram????
---
Could try twitter since thats pretty direct.

So that's what an exotic looks like...

People knew what they were in for just by looking a d1 if you expected it to change thats on you. It sucks but thems the facts. But then again imo destiny is the only game i would repeat it for.

It's not possible to replay that mission. Whether or not you killed Mithrax does not seem to make any difference.

I took two tailed fox into a strike and I was not disappointed

That‚Äôs a lot of shooting to be a Titan

Next week. According to google, the flashpoint order is:

Ah, ok

There are lots /r/fireteams

&gt;we all know
---
Uh I much prefer the crucible now than the double primary meta of destiny 2 vanilla or even late destiny 1 sidearm spam
---
Honestly middle and bottom arcstrider feel left behind. 
---
Middle tree because the abilities feel like they have to be combo-ed in a certain way to get the full effect. Plus the damage buff window for blocking seems so short for the super it uses up.
---
Bottom tree just feels weird and out of place. Everything revolves around sprinting and...  that's pretty much it. sure there's the stunning melee, but that's it. Not sure how much it synergizes with frosties tbh, but if you can't kill shit while sprinting what's the fun in that?
---
Not offering help, just here to tell you how much I envy you to be able to experience this game with virgin eyes
---
Year 1 raids can award exotic engrams that don't auto-decrypt
---
Nf,  midnight coup and recluse
---
Year one raids (such as the secret chest from EoW) can drop exotics like that.
---
That's a pretty good roll.
---
I got mine with Rapid Hit and Rampage, and also have it Masterworked for Stability.
---
Absolutely love it, PVP and PVE.
---
This is the kinda thing I like to see when get to the tower.
---
Completly agree.
---
That's a story though, not an adventure

Oh, I hadn‚Äôt realized with the ornament on.

I can't even make it past Brave III lol.

Outrage and Range masterwork for mine, I call him Wellington

This one is an imposter

Why isn't crimson in the name tho :(

Rivensbane is always a good one. I was able to get an lfg together, for both flawless. Chill people still exist. As for grinding for the Blacksmith ship, can't go wrong with more weapons.

The top  image is that McFarland figure.

I soloed to 2100 using that bow. It‚Äôs too good

Bad luck did it yesterday and still works for completion and configuration.
---
You win the game
---
bruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh LMAO
---
it‚Äôs basically all Y1 stuff you can‚Äôt get anymore
---
So is the Mountaintop actually worth grinding I have halfway progress on Luna‚Äôs Howl and Redrix‚Äôs Broadsword and those are what I was gonna work on next before the end of the season 
---
Nice word play btw üëåüèæ
---
How long have you played for?
---
Throw your guns at Trevor and duct tape the pieces and this gun will be yours
---
I agree, I would very much like to see that hunk of vex perfection again.
---
I linked it here because I believe it would be of interest to the person who posted this
---
In total? Or just in IB?
---
I dont know the numbers, but I played a lot! In D1 I got every IB armor and weapon there was for all 3 Chars.
---
Now in D2, I dont even play IB anymore. Did it on my main to get the gear and never jumped back in it. Its just a waste of time now...
---
Let‚Äôs face it Shaxx has all the good weapons and we all would‚Äôve sided with him if it was an option
---
^(Shuro Chi's tempo quickens)
---
The curated roll that you get for Redrix is pretty shitty IMO. But I exchanged some tokens and got a really nice roll with a range masterwork. I'm saying that because a lot of people criticized this weapon because they were playing with the curated roll, so as a piece of advice here, if you decide to go for the Redrix, don't get attached to the first weapon, get exchanging tokens to get a good one.
---
Same roll but with rampage. One of my favorite hand cannons especially with pairing it with Fighting Lion. Also been great for getting my Iron Burden kills.
---
Why does that woman look so angry?
---
Killtacular!
---
I wish I could experience this.
---
I hope they will bring an item filter option. So you can determine what sort of items you want/don't want to pick up. I don't like getting spammed with blue items.
---
Maybe there will also be an Option for only picking up several shaders.
---
so basically you want like a freighter with some docking bays for other vehicles and a storage room for item.
---
That would be awesome. Im going to be on quite a bit end of May.
---
Yeah basically, but doesn't need to be as big as ones in No Man's Sky. Maybe the ships can stay the same size cosmetically but have a Tardis effect (bigger on the inside)
---
Or instead of the freighters like no mans sky, we are the Captain of one of the Cities battle class cruisers in the fleet. and your fireteam can use their own ships as fighters for like a strike or patrol.
---
Was there any doubt?
---
Only to the people that didn‚Äôt throw enough grenades
---
but can you fan the hammer tho?

reasonable
---
For some reason the allegiance quest never showed up for me. Its super annoying. I have Thorn, and Last word. (I dont know if that matters or not but gave the info anyhow) has anyone else had this problem?
---
You could just swap them out for a different elemental mod whenever you wanted. Other than that, permanent.
---

Oh no, here come all the [Beyond Good and Evil](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BeyondGoodAndEvil) people. lmao

I mean you‚Äôre pretty close with 1400, at first I thought I was ruining my experience but I stopped being serious and it‚Äôs real exhilarating now I‚Äôm at 1970
---
-Midnight Coup
---
-Merciless
---
-Braytech Osprey
---
I complained before and after, and I have it. It‚Äôs consistent, has respectable range and a passive faster time to kill than most other weapons aside from god rolls with timed perks or Recluse. Something should‚Äôve been done, just not this imo. A lot of things could‚Äôve been done without removing the guns‚Äô purpose and uniqueness entirely
---
What is this from?
---
I mean I find Wizened rebuke to be pretty good, I‚Äôve been using it while burdened and I got like 380 kills on it
---
Drifter's "old buddy" is definitely more of a "Wait, is this dude a villain?" than an "ultra-good guy".
---
It's based off the Chiappa rhino that has an internal hammer and the external "hammer" you see here !
---
There are computers scattered around the EDZ with them.
---
I mean they could bring back young wolfs howl sword
---
I mean, the city is literally the last of humanity and the guardians are the ONLY ones who are protecting it. It'd be fine if it were a fob, but it's the headquarters of all of humanity. It would be absolutely moronic to leave it defenseless, *especially* so soon after already being attacked and becoming rediculously weakened by the cabal
---
Alright fine, let's say zavala said "yeah let's go" and every guardian goes off to galavant around the reef, just like ikora suggests. We find uldren, lop off his head, then hunt/kill the rest of the barons. Hell, I'll even throw in the situation that nobody got permakilled either in the process. Huzzah. Well while we're partying it up in our ships and returning home, we see that the hive has taken over a completely defenseless city and knights have killed the last of humanity, rendering our species extinct while using it as breeding grounds for ogres. Whoopsie daisy. Not only that, but they have already started literally eating the traveler, and we see the last remnants of it getting devoured as our light disappears *again*, except this time permanently. We get shot out of the sky by hive tomb ships because my flashy dragonfly ship doesn't have any guns, the game deletes itself from our libraries
---
A picture of Matthew Mcconaughey at a football game
---
Zealot how? Drifter definitely lead to the permanent death of at least 3 guardians.
---
Gotcha, didn't get the reference, thanks
---
Sort of a "the enemy of my enemy is my friend", the way I see it.
---
I think you have to play Gambit Prime and move forward with the synthesizer quests to unlock it.
---
How do people do this
---
Hold up, so you're saying he protects his own but also only protects himself over his crews? Also, the vanguard are a major centerpiece/one of the only groups that have helped you, with 2 games worth of history of continuously helping you, but they aren't going to help you when the next thing comes?
---
You're really bending over backwards for this guy
---
Whisper of the Worm is available to start every time there is a public event in Lost Oasis on Io. It used to be just Taken Blights, but now it works from the cabal event as well. 
---
Other than that, nothing has changed with it, so any guide is sufficient beyond that point.
---
Dang, I was going to offer to help. You might try the D2 companion app or r/fireteams to find a group. Good luck Guardian!
---
Thank you for the quick reply, its just been a while since i last did it and that was on xbox, so i thought things may have changed on pc
---
In terms of what you should do--I'd personally run through it solo at least a few times, until you're comfortable with the jumping portion, and maybe the first enemy encounter or two. Once you're good at the jumping puzzle, the chances of success with a team of 3 are pretty high (provided they've also gotten the path down).
---
Omg will you shutup
---
Combination*
---
I‚Äôve seen so many memes about this helmet and I still have no idea what it does
---
nightfalls are on a weekly rotation. they don't change until weekly reset
---
Well no, first quest step is the "complete a gambit prime bounty" thingy that you can pick up from him.

Dude made serious comment with obvious explaining flaw
---
I made a satirical Ken M response
---
Second dude got butthurt about said satirical post
---
...
---
Results?
---
It would be imagine matches being fired at you
---
it's an exotic that gets better the better the player is. I tried it out a few games just to see and I still believe it's well above average (not actually OP like before...) in power level. It shouldn't be a crutch for people to rely on to win all the time.
---
‚ÄòDon‚Äôt talk to me or my son ever again‚Äô probably would‚Äôve worked better
---
Now that's a meme worthy of gold
---
Time to put my glitch shoes on
---
Laughed way too long at no you
---
I know right! I was honestly stunned when my super ran out and didn't know what to do
---
I‚Äôm sorry man :( thanks for loving my stuff though ;D
---
Or ride it, or make selfies with it, or eat it, or try to put shaders on it... 
---
The options are nigh unlimited.
---
It‚Äôs my own custom version, but you can use the lael lee version.
---
I found a hole in the wall on nessus as well. nothing there.
---
who are you
---
Motes... that‚Äôs the only reason drifter likes you.
---
Didn‚Äôt know about that. And I‚Äôm not much of reposter, so, if you can prove that, I‚Äôll just take this down. 
---
Thanks for the upvote btw!
---
Besides a very cool emblem you can give your forged weapons a damageboost, it will only work in the forges however
---
At some point she'll start to violently gyrate so you'll need to surround her with soft objects.
---
Then its recommended you get some coolant cells akin to the ones you'd find in nuclear power plants and attach a couple to her cape.
---
From there you go ahead and wait and within a short moment you'll have the best grilled steak that the black armory can offer
---
Thanks bro the steaks going to be amazing
---
That is quite the rainbow!

Way too quickly

So do I win? cause I can legit say "blackout"

Pretty much yeah I play iron banner with a 368 light level because I can‚Äôt afford forsaken but it‚Äôs even worse when people camp the whole game in the corner with a shotgun
---
Yeaah. Our other 2 teammates left before the first round was even over I think.
---
I appreciate the t-bag
---
Shards also getting nerfed actually
---
Eh it‚Äôs just D1 Black Spindle now just that‚Äôs in the heavy spot
---
its not a hammer. just used for cocking the internal hammer
---
Time to main a titan
---
The nerfs coming
---
NAAAAIIIIISU
---
Turn in the extra Drifter engram and get an exotic
---
Thanks
---
Why are we still here? My PvE Luna's Howl, and your Whisper of the Worm. They're gone but we can still feel them like they're still here.
---
bungie we want to have power fantasy ... NERFS EVERYTHING. gg bungie might be loosing alot of people to Borderlands 3 if you keep fucking up
---
No You, the Chinese clown?
---
It's like Infinity War, but with our gear.
---
No, the racist joke.
---
Yup, glad we had the black hammer version while we did
---
nerf to exotics giving super energy back (skull, orpheus, pheonix) also a fucking neutering of whisper of the worm no longer giving us ammo from aether
---
To hell with them.
---
the weather
---
all people complaining of the nerf that is absurd and make the whisper useless the whisper still have more damage in precision hits, that's his perk not infinite ammo.
