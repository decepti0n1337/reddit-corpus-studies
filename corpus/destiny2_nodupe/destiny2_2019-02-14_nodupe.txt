You're only "that guy" when you start shitting on other people for playing their own way.  You and your clan are welcome to play however you wish.
---
---
---
Yeah, as @CMD\_Neopolitan said.  You can keep killing the heroic adventure boss until an armor piece drops.  Every class has a legendary helmet and chest piece.
---
I agree.  I see why you'd say that.
---
Sorry for being a day late, but I disagree with your thought process. 
---

---
This same argument comes up in subs like r/nostupidquestions and a bunch like it. Why can‚Äôt people just google it instead of making a thread for it? The best thing about reddit is the conversations you can have in threads. It is a forum website pretty much anyway. So why not allow people to have conversations? 
---
Regarding quest guides... yeah, I can read an article about it on Eurogamer. Yeah, I can watch a video for it on YouTube... but I would rather have it be a thread in a mega thread or it‚Äôs own post, because there, I can ask many questions and be answered. Different people can give various input, in regards ‚ÄúI play this class and this subclass, with this setup and it worked best for me‚Äù, but there can be a million different answers. Compare that to an article or video, where you spend a lot of time sifting through a ton of different crap just to find a class/subclass/loadout/play style that fits you.
---
didn‚Äôt meet him over d2, but my boyfriend got me into it and now we both kinda onsess over it
---
Thanks again! Almost there, but not too worried if I don‚Äôt get it.
---
I agree.   As stated, I'm pretty sure Bungie is using this as an opportunity to bring all of the year 1 content forward before year 3 drops.   This would be a perfect opportunity to do that and to a put the nail in Calus's coffin for good.  I'm hoping that all of the raid lairs get updated as well because I don't see how it'd make sense for them not to.
---
Activision and Bungie didn‚Äôt separate, Activision laid off Bungie but they keep failing to *not* come in to work and no one is really sure what to do about it.
---
A while back you could ;)
---
I think Zavala looks fine I think it‚Äôs because his eye size has been consistent throughout the cutscenes 
---
What a douchebag
---
Bungie were completely seperate, wouldn't have effected them.
---
Now, they're in the process of becoming indie... almost certainly as a byproduct of Activision not doing so well (I'd imagine Destiny is a hell lot less profitable for the cost then something like cod).
---
*Ninja, ruiner of memes*

It's a shit fusion thats only situationaly good at best it's one of the easiest guns in the game to avoid the sound que can be heard from across the map and once u know who has it it should be easy to dodge all you people do is whine and complain to Nerf unique guns just learn to play the game instead of having a cry on the internet

Good to know man! Will definitely keep that in mind.
---
The other problem with that theory is that my teammate that did the invading got a full wipe at least twice.
---
I swear this is the only reason why I have everything switched to be as dark as possible, still get blind anyway 
---
That was fucking epicüòÇ
---
That detail goes under the helmet which only sometimes gets blown off. They could have chosen not to use graphics in this level since it only gets seen half the time. Are you a natural troll? Just wondering.
---
Invading is helping. Both invading and banking is how you win. Yall should go bank anyway... I've had too many teammates die with 10+ motes because of being cocky. Three Medium Blockers are harder to take down than two Large Blockers and both are Worth 30 Motes.

When you make an original meme and someone reposts it:

DO NOT PLAY GAMBIT GUARDIANS! PLAY THE CRUCIBLE!

---
Same. Activision did the "more or less you play" thing for almost all of their games. It's logical. If people play too much they get burned out of a game. If they play too little they have no motivation. It would make sense that if it were in destiny it would be removed. I noticed my exotic drop rates skyrocket in the weeks after the first update after the split. In 3 weeks I have acquired every energy and power exotic except upgraded acrius and anarchy, so there's got to be some correlation.
---
hammerhead is a very good weapon for invading but i believe its better than the malf at both ad clear and invaders  plus its good at invading
---
HAVE FUN, GUARDIAN!

Ghaul was the strength of the Red Legion. It just shows how much he contributed. They had gone undefeated in so many battles their Psions lost count and digital record could not hold all the data of their conquests. The second Ghaul dies and they get their ass handed to them by nearly everyone. Honestly I really hope for a Ghaul comeback, there was so much more they could have done with him. A respectable bad guy that you hate but also respect at the same time is hard to pull off. People say he's a coward for taking the Light from the Guardians, but it is like Ghaul said "You call me a coward for leveling the playing field? You guardians traipse with no worry, with immortality. I have entered every battle at the fore front knowing I could be permanently killed. There is no courage in looking death in the face when you can not die." Ghaul didn't want to steal the Light and honestly I believe if he didn't he would have been revived by a ghost after he died. He had met every criteria The Speaker had said, and even The Speaker agreed "Maybe in a different life.." 
---
I was honestly hoping Pulled Pork would be Ghauls when I originally read his lore. Ghaul would have been a wicked Titan.
---
That I do not but people seemingly would rather just roll the dice more times than take their time with a possibly increased chance. 
---
I honestly prefer RiskRunner over malf for dealing with taken...
---
True, true. How many people do you think use guns right, though?
---
Wow, they are both boxes. That is crazy
---
Love this, I'm still waiting for my womens gambit t to restock in my small size for longer than 3 days and been waiting months!

Oh sorry, I  was confused because your initial comment said "the drop chance doesn‚Äôt change based on the type of event."

I need this

My favorite is someone who killed you when your already 1 shot from another, a super or when there entire team is there.

43 completions to get shotgun. Which means probably started 100 of them with people bailing out all the time. Love that shotty tho!!

That out of place apostrophe will haunt me to my grave

Literally at that point you have to just give that to them haha

This monstrosity
---
Is nobody gonna comment on how it did only 23 damage?
---
Oh, no I meant your title which started out as Dredgen.
---
It's the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man!
---
its literally different for every event
---
and some events are just the same shit but way longer
---
and others have some obscure triggers, and others require insane amounts of damage to trigger.
---
Like the stupid microwaves that spawn during glimmer extraction. It takes what feels like half a magazine from thunderlord to kill them.
---
The helmet stayed on...her

Oh haha, I didn't even notice that

That's crimson days in a nutshell

I actually just searched for a loading screen on the web bc I have an ultrawide monitor and the screenshot wouldn‚Äôt fit :P
---
Why do people do this? I picked up the game recently and constantly found level 50s doing this for no apparent reason. I thought maybe because they were max level they might know better but i'm 600LL now and have no idea why it might be beneficial.
---
Nice! I hope to get the shotgun sometime too,
---
Lol I'll look at the ships when I get home and find out what it is
---
Fucking LOL
---
omg thats hilarious lol
---
I'm a new player and figured out most of them by myself, only had to google a couple. The real problem I see is level 50s who just can't be bothered or are just braindead.
---
What the fuck did you bring upon this cursed land

If you put a single bullet into him, he'll kill your entire family by using 2% of his power. Amazing, gaurdian.

This made it beatable with time to spare

Oh no not my one extra planet mat
---
Right now in the Tangled Shore, people are doing normal PE‚Äôs to grind for the Variks lore, since it‚Äôs only available when Tangled Shore is the Flashpoint. Normal PE‚Äôs are faster to do than Heroic (especially with Cryo Pod) and provide no extra chance for lore, so normal it is.
---
I want Obito ornament now.  :(
---
You cant. They'll begin to feel bad enough to do it for you. Only *Gods* can do as they please
---
You get the shorty from killing the boss ogre, you don‚Äôt have to open the chest. At least that‚Äôs how it was. Not sure if that‚Äôs been changed recently 
---
You will. When your just about to give up. 2 shaders and shotgun will be laying there waiting for pickup! 
---
Destiny 2 : REVENGENCE

The shielded taken bubble from the taken event... I emptied 311 thunderlord bullets and a golden gun with celestial nighthawk into that thing...
---
No problemo. I was panicked Tuesday because I wasn‚Äôt sure if it‚Äôd work that way and wanted to make sure I got that ghost. Pleasantly surprised to say the least :)
---
Too soon
---
Thanks I tried out the vow, the crimson days bow was ok I used arsenic bite that was way better due to explosive heads I had tiger spite as my back up but didn‚Äôt think to go a hand cannon I‚Äôll try that but running tigerspite/arsenic bite I ended up with 85 kills for the game which is ok for me haha
---
Same fam. Same.

Well said

That‚Äôs why that mask exists

When you shamelessly repost the same thing over and over

Login everyday and do the milestones, easy as that, takes like 2 weeks lol
---
All loot pretty much scales unless it is a year one loot drop. However, any strike you do will be fine. Especially if it is of the matchmaking type.
---
As for light levels, think of everything 50 above and 50 below. This means if you are 50 light levels or more below an activity, the enemies will be immune to your damage. (Example: You go into the first Black Armory Forge with a light level requirement of 610. If you are light level 560 or lower you cannot damage anything.)
---
Also, if you are 50 light levels or more higher, the additional damage increase stops. (Example: You go into the Leviathan raid with a light level requirement of 300. If you are light level 650 you would not do more damage than anyone who is at light level 350.)
---
Console or pc

lol got it like a few days ago

Im suddenly getting forsaken drops nonstop

I actually thought that these are just players with really bad connection/controls D:

Agreed. Tether main since they day it was available XD
---
Would make them underpowered and useless.
---
You've made me realise that apostrophe and it hurts my feelings...
---
If they made them like that then they'd be absolutely useless. It's already difficult to justify using a bow over a pulse or a hc, or Breakneck in particular. I love using spiteful fang for example and I am having trouble justifying it in comparison to my outlaw rampage duke or Breakneck, not that that stops me. 
---
I still use it because it's still okay to, but if it had loads of travel time and drop off then it'd be so much harder to use that using one is just gimping yourself.
---
Subtle Calamity, Arsenic Bite, The Vow, Spiteful Fang and No Turning Back.
---
There's better bows than No Turning Back.
---
I will agree that i typo'd whisper into burst (was not the intention, dont recall saying it but ig i typed it)
---
However i cant agree that izanagi with box breathing will hinder performance. 
---
Yes izanagi can one shot body but you are sacrificing 4 shots, and in pvp that is huge. And you better not miss. Or else that's 4 shots gone. There is no benefit for box breathing izanagi in pvp, which isnt the intention in the first place
---
Box breathing just seems like it would synergize with izanagi all too well. 
---
I dont recall izanagi being the highest burst damage gun atm. It is in the top but not number one. 
---
It isnt really being used in most activities however (unlike acrius)
---
It gets outshined in the raids by whisper or acrius (because it is so slow to get the damage going), and i think it will compete with whisper more if it did have box breathing
---
Well if isnt being used in raids, how is it in normal pve? Oh wait, acrius. 
---
Well it is a one shot in pvp. It also isnt terrible in gambit
---
Also, outshined by other great primaries like last word or chaperone
---
Izanagis main focus is pve. 
---
And it isnt being used much. Even in something like bergusia, whisper outshines it. In niobe, outshined by whisper (or acrius or hell even tractor cannon)
---
I really dont see a downside in the meta if izanagi's burden got box breathing. It would synergize with its main perk, would legit be able to compete with things like whisper or darci (maybe even acrius)
---
I also cant see what they would do to buff izanagi with a catalyst so if you want to give me an idea of a good "balanced" catalyst for izanagi, please give me feedback.
---
This game should have a power fantasy, and box breathing with that sniper would do it for me
---
Me too but I' not very funny , well I'm not funny at all 
---
Oh , well yeah it must be random 
---
Amazing!
---
I don't know if you've tried, but doing raids (last wish and scourge of the past in this case) is pretty good for leveling your light level, as they drop powerful rewards repeated times, you'd have 5 in Last Wish + 3 in Scourge, that's 8 powerful rewards in total that are supposed to level you up (unless you're hit by really bad luck in the drops)
---
ENCRYPTED 
---
Thank you :)
---
Have a good one !
---
oof sounds about right lol, and yeah exactly covered in sweat, trying so hard you leave a wet patch where you sit Xd
---
Dreaming city stops being high powerful rewards past 580. Regardless this person obviously has limited play time so efficiency is more important. We also don't know if they even have BA which will slow you down as well. How about you actually be helpful instead of belittling people for being slower than you.

Great job on your first clear, congrats on your loot! Just be warned about the potential incoming hate

Yup.  It's a major "duck and cover" moment.

Yeah because Slowva Bomb is so slow it can't even kill someone that it follows for 10 seconds

Yup, the last couple of episodes (that I've had the time to watch) they could have easily caught him if Barry had not stopped for a motivational speech allowing him to escape.

Everyone has their preferences. In my experience, most SMGs are useless in PVP but it's cool you found one that works.

I read that the top tree Stormcaller can be very effective at taking down other roaming supers like Spastic Blades, if you use it right. But I agree that warlock need an overall buff to be as reliable in PvP

It took me two body missiles, all my EP shotty ammo, and a few rockets...for the other randos to figure out what I was doing. 
---
What show is this?
---
But you can't compare Luna's and 1k Voices .. one is a pinnacle weapon you need work hard to get and other is a RNG dependant drop. It's also nothing to brag about when RNG screws over so many veterans who finished it  50+ times. 
---
it's a pure brag post serving only to rub salt.
---
(That's comming from someone who got his two 1k Voices at once on his 2nd raid.)
---
Just do everything that gives Powerful Gear. There are tons of daily and weekly bounties that give them and each one is a guaranteed light level upgrade. I just went from 624 to 638 light level yesterday alone.
---
Well why not? Titans have it bad enough in most PVE situations (bungo pls give us weapons of light back) and in pvp shoulder charge is easily countered by shotguns
---
What I have found weird is that the bounties DO NOT really say where to go. For instance, one bounty I got said to ‚Äúbegin hunt in Core Terminus on Mars.‚Äù There is no such place on the map! I literally went to EVERY spot everywhere assuming that guy might be hiding out in some weird spot. 3 hours of grind, no Wanted dude found... 
---
This is the first thing in Destiny 2 that I‚Äôve felt could have been done a little better...
---
What was I missing in the game (not from an online guide) that would make this easier to do?
---
Late reply, but I shot it off the map
---
But it's literally the only thing this exotic is good for. If you nerf it it has no place ...anywhere.
---
It's a lot easier because you're not being snuck up on by 6 enemies. As you said, it's a lot easier to manage 2 enemies vs 6. For established PvPers, 6 vs 6 is normal and natural. For people who seldom PvP, it's a real difference.
---
During Crimson or before that?
---
What shotty was that? 
---
Fucken glitch in the matrix right there
---
Good job. It‚Äôs nice to be helpful in a world where people need it. 
---
Wrong, it's obviously random

For me : Alright, Alright, Alright. Lets see what we got! Anorexia. Bring the coffee!

I did actually with skull of dire ahamkara on as well. Even when I tried it late last night to put it under him so the axion darts would bloom up into him his phasing in and out causes it to lose some of its muster when it goes boom.

Chaos reach was plenty fast. Could have probably used sleeper and been quicker really.

But. Boopaloop.

Still one of the coolest sets in the game, shame about the perks. I still wear my ornamented Trials cape myself, I love it too much lol.

I wouldn't infuse a masterwork weapon unless you have A LOT of excess cores. Just carry it around, you don't have to equip it to benefit from the higher level.

Honestly, helping out new players is one of my favorite things to do, I still do a bunch of free roaming and public events for this reason (currently at 2336 PEs completed, lol). We were all blueberries at one point, so I try not to judge anyone too quickly.
---
Go back to rumble eventually you will be up against like skilled players thats how i got the ace hard work but some matches i even got 2 kills but being bottom i always played against mostly newbies lol
---
Helmets. I mean. Shoulders arent big enough.
---
I do this so often I've had to learn to use sparrows like a yoshi and bounce off of them. 
---
Sweet! Also one of the single coolest looking pieces of armor in the game imho, I absolutely love the design of it.
---
When I played WoW, one of my favorite things to do was run out and help bring people through dungeons. 
---
Then they have everyone free max level characters and helping people just didn‚Äôt happen anymore. 
---
Thx, I know but I need them to do in the competitive playlist. It's all I need for the Lunas 
---
the shitty thing about heroic events is that if you want to help someone, they have to opt-in to even see local chatt / enabled whispers, or they wont see it at all... its a terrible design on bungie's part clearly to defend the kinderguardian's from their "toxic community"
---
You pretty much got an exact location, Core Terminus is a lost sector. If you open the map and hover your cursor over a lost sector its name is displayed. It's the one on the Braytech Futurescape.

Was one of your keys the Glittering Key? If so, that only drops once, and it unlocks the chest to get the raid ship. If you got the wish wall key, that‚Äôs once per account lifetime. Otherwise, you get one key per character per week for a maximum of three keys each week.

Yeah but still a great feature. Also a way to get another guardians attention in game. Instead of shooting them a message via xbox app

Some quests and bounties require heroic public events to complete. I feel like on the Tangled Shore and Dreaming City heroic drop lore more often, but others say it's the same chance, so I am not sure about that. Some heroic events take the same amount or less time than the normal versions. 
---
Plus with middle tree on you can block other incoming supers, aka golden guns.
---
I dont hear it
---
No, that‚Äôs still how it is.
---
Source: got the shotty as a drop from the boss ogre this week, didn‚Äôt have a key to open the chest.
---
nah that's the reaction when people don't know how to work the orbs on the dreamingcity strike (blanking on the name)
---
that movie looks stupid. just the title is enough to turn me away
---
Are you on PC?
---
yeah that happens to me way to much
---
This could work out with many weapon combos but this one seems nice as well, def would try that one.
---
It's pretty neat. I can't even remember what I did to get it though lol.
---
I can beat that, when you need like 2 to summon the prime, 3 of you are standing at the bank waiting for the other guy to finally bank but he‚Äôs going for 15 like a fool, gets 15 but here‚Äôs the twist ,on the way to the bank they go up that fucking pipe on Kells Grave and fall off 
---
Kind of shit that you have to start over but it worked when i did
---
You got one for beating riven and one because someone entered wish #1 for you at the wishing wall. 
---
I think OP means a guided games Nightfall. Which doesn't count for challenges, so he needs to follow your advice and do a normal nightfall with 1 (and only 1 I think?) person in his fireteam.
---
I ended up doing it in 5 mins accidentally while using a SMG while walking towards the Oracle Engine mission start in the dreaming city. 
---
They...his..stop
---
Video game lore consistency doesn't have to be taken seriously either. OP simply wants an easter egg. Not to debate the idea that it could exist somewhere in the game world. 
---
Oh, gotcha. I didn't think a single person still did guided games nightfalls, but as the system requires 2 clan members + 1 seeker, or definitionally would not apply to the CD bounty.
---
It was like an appreciate package if you pre-ordered destiny 2 
---
Follow them.
---
Where‚Äôs the dude who has all the shaxx quotes, i know you‚Äôve gotta have a good one for this 
---
Boy is T H I C C 
---
Wait.... WHY CAN HE SEE ME THROUGH WALLS WHAT IS VENGENCE x34 
---
Obviously.
---
Run Forest!! RUN!!
---
They made him to smart in short
---
You... can't *understand* why people think of her as his step sister, when her father took him in and treated him like a son?
---
Was probably smashed to bits by a Cabal landing pod
---
I do but they still take off without me or if I die they don't back off like they should and wait for my respawn. 
---
Yea, I've even noticed it doesn't count score so you can't get the 100k milestone doing a guided Nightfall, because me and my buddy used to guide all the time when we were looking for more players to invite to our clan.
---
I think the guided games is just for teaching/recruiting and doesn't count for many or any milestones/bounties.
---
sparrows reroll stats when you reacquire them through collections? 
---
I've been running this build for some time, although I call it the "Michael Bay" due to the excessive number of explosions it creates, especially as I run it with Graviton Lance *(more easily obtainable than all the suggested weapons)*. There's no such thing as "too many" Void explosions...
---
lol
---
Yeah. I'm part of d small clan and everyone has been busy so far this week. Hoping someone will be available the next couple days. 
---
If they have a random perk slot yeah
---
No way! But I said that about the luna in the beginning too üôà
---
Thought as much! Thank you :)
---
This always reminds of the infinite nova bomb glitch in year 1 mayhem
---
....did you get that today? what a funny coincidence xD
---
Last night I was doing the prisoner escape at the Saturn jetsam and every time I threw the orb at the Knight, the son of a bitch would teleport an instant before it hit. I missed three times.
---
I was so mad. Still irritates me to think about it 12 hours later... lol
---
After that I didn't even care that it wasn't heroic. 
---
Good luck with the rest of em
---
XD XD XD
---
I'm just imagining the Slowva Bomb chasing those two players through a hallway full of doors in a spooky mansion.
---
Just look up the reset reward and decide if you actually want it or not. I can tell you what it is, but I don't want to spoil it for you if you don't know. 
---
Your claim is 2 shot kill becomes 1 shot kill with OEM. This is 100% false and you know it. No exceptions. 
---
Ace is not one of the most used weapons in PvP the fuck are you on about? 
---
Go take a look at you're spreadsheets and when you find fuck all to support your bullshit claim I'll be here for you to admit you're wrong. If I'm wrong then I want to see the proof that you know doesn't exist. 
---
Anything else you want to claim with fuck all support while you're at it?
---
same here, this ghostshell alone is gonne make me fat
---
Because what are you proud of?! I just don't get it! If you've truly RESET 15k infamy SEVEN times then 3 6 kills is absolutely awful! Thats a tiny number! You could get that in 2 matches? I'm lost?
---
PC user here, thoughts on dim??  I'm not wild about 3rd party apps, but if it makes things easier...
---
What helmet is that
---
Watch out the Hunters will come for you.
---
Well there you go. The OP warlock exotic should be to give warlocks shade step and hunter triple jump lul
---
I thought that it also counted pvp kills.
---
That would mean that I could prove that I haven‚Äôt used queen breaker like almost all the other people who got their Dredgen title.
---
Or have an Opportunity rover ghost shell. Maybe make it the square camera from the rover, or give it a shell with dusty solar panels.
---

There's a decent picture somewhere with all the details for each event. People are just reluctant to google things.
---
This Video Is Bad Clickbait And Isn't Necessary
---
I got shards of galanor from the end last night still very excited about them
---
So super kills players and its OP.... Don't ALL supers murder guardians like that?   
---
Nice play tho. 
---
I'd really like to disagree - but we have no idea as of yet, all we have is rumors and supposed leaks. The way I'm looking at is is that we are moving into D3 within the next year or so and they couldn't possibly end D2 with a Black Armory sized DLC, it really wouldn't make sense. Could they? Sure, but I seriously doubt they would do that. I've gone back to find some resources on this but as I mentioned there really isn't anything yet except rumors and supposed leaks

Dredgen is literally the easiest title and there's no pride in not using an exotic. People use 1K and Thunderlord just as much, even Zenobia-D can nail Army Of Ones with ease.

I like the claws of the wolf pulse rifle instead of a kindled orchid for my void weapon. 
---
Because weapons are down to opinion and no one needs a 10 minute video on it. Much like Horror Story they're obviously not going to give away amazing weapons with ease
---
The amount of misinformation that is spread around by one player scares me.
---
Bungie never once called the changes to Titan skating a Nerf. The closest they came to it was calling it a fix. They were very explicit in clarifying before way back when they first were looking at the issue and now they have the solution, that they will not affect people at all who do not use the macros.
---
So you have absolutely nothing to worry about.
---
Their exact quote for all to see:
---
When¬†Destiny 2¬†launched on PC, some Titans among you were quick to realize that they could break the sound barrier through tricky input methods. The Sandbox team has been hard at work, looking at ways to address this issue without impacting general movement for the Titan class. We are currently planning for changes to be implemented in¬†Destiny 2¬†Update 2.2.0, coming in March, to address Titan Skating. Here are the details:
---
Sandbox: Later this month, we are fixing an issue with the Titan Lift ability that currently allows players, with the use of unconventional inputs (keybinding to mouse scrollwheel, macros, etc.), to reach extremely excessive movement speeds. It will still be possible to maximize your Lift speed by skillfully timing your Lift activation inputs to boost your overall momentum. In other words, ‚ÄúTitan Skating‚Äù is still possible, just less excessive.
---
Some of you may be asking why this is being addressed. Players utilizing these unconventional methods are effectively able to exceed the bounds of expected Guardian movement speed so drastically that it creates an unfair advantage when it comes to the fundamentals of combat gameplay like aiming, positioning, and even networking to some degree. We understand that many players value and enjoy this behavior as a core part of the overall skillset and identity of the Titan class. However, we‚Äôd rather continue to build on the Titan identity and fantasy of being a fast-moving, aggressive, jetpack warrior by continuing to build new, fully supported abilities. Our goal is to create abilities that are fun, effective, and skillful without requiring special hardware or macros to access them.
---
Players who do not use macros should not feel any difference once this change is deployed. This strictly addresses Lift acceleration issues on PC; players who don‚Äôt utilize unconventional input methods should feel no difference.
---
We encourage you to keep an eye out for any inconsistencies and to let us know if this change does not meet your expectations for how Lift should work.
---
I don't get it. 
---
Did not know this! 
---
It makes it funnier lol
---
How do i kms if i respawn everytime
---
Yeah I love this Iron Banner weapon as well! Happy cake day Guardian!
---
Consider yourself lucky then
---
Last Weeks Scourge of the Past Raid i got Threat Level 3 times in a row... All shit perks tho :x
---
My favorite is when you've killed the person multiple time and they finally kill you after you just killed two or three of their teammates and are heavily damaged. Didn't earn it in anyway, especially when you go back to killing them constantly again immediately afterward.
---
Yep. Great post. Thank you!
---
yeah jotunn has been very entertaining for me. its great in EP against the yellow bar wizards and their solar shield. and i got the shotty today and puts me 1 step closer to wayfarer title
---
It‚Äôs great actually. Use for mobs w/ nez then rely on Hammerhead for the dps.
---
Warframe really has no endgame right now and it‚Äôs the king of grindfests
---
Thanks man. 
---
Ah well that's good to know, thanks man
---
Gambit Chrome master race. 
---
Veist, Suros, Tex Mechanica, and others. Basically they make the weapons
---
It is season of the \[Spoiler\]shadow\[/Spoiler\]
---
&gt; to at least try and figure it out.
---
Also new-ish since November (free game and cheap expansions!), and figure out stuff like this is one of the reason I even play games.  To me, that is a large chunk of the appeal.  Any monkey can google stuff and follow the instructions left by other players.
---
Well I mean it didn't die near the polar ice caps did it?
---
Yeah you're a joke, the helmet stayed on, and an over competitive dodgeball dad. Everytime I think of you that's what I recall. 
---
Calling someone a pussy can catch the other dude a comms ban though üëç
---
I was trying to get the wish ender bow and the video I saw said I needed to do the shattered throne mission. I tried but the portal would not open for me.
---
Agreed. I believe he will be wanting to help us &gt;!fight the darkness !&lt;because he likes to watch a good show.
---
Would still be a cool feature to have available.
---
I see them on amazon for $15 or $20 bucks
---
Also saw a few at GameStop
---
I know you are but what am I.
---
If that makes you feel better ok
---
YOU ARE FORGETTING SOMETHING GUARDIAN! DRIFTER‚ÄôS EVIL MEATBALLS CAN BE ONE SHOT WITH THE CELESTIAL NIGHTHAWK **IF** YOU HAVE PRIMEVAL SLAYER X10
---
I was trying to get wish ender and video I watched said I needed to start shattered throne
---
Do you:
---
1. Play on Wifi
---
2. Have a so-so internet connection
---
3. Live in a more remote/rural area
---
4. Have a good Internet service provider, or bad service provider
---
5. Commonly experience lag
---
6. Use third party software / overlays during destiny
---
7. Use any kind of software that manipulates connections(VPN, or anything at all)
---
8. Have anyone else play on your account
---
Answer as many of these questions as you can, may help pinpoint the cause. I have a guess, but I wont know until after I have more specifics.
---
They are amazing to fire thanks to the six-o'clock cylinder, too. It's one of the best guns to fire a .357Magnum from.
---
I'm at 649 and just need legs but all I get are 650 helmets or ten paces
---
Whenever I solo blight events, I destroy the first 2 waves of small blights. On the third wave the big blight is easier to destroy.  Don‚Äôt know why, it just is. 
---
better than half the D2 armours.
---
Datto on YouTube makes great guides that are straight to the point for each encounter. 
---
its literally the cost of 10$, the amount of content we got for the price is really good. 
---
I have that dlc and I was trying to get wish ender and the video I watched said I had to start the shattered throne mission. I went to the portal but it was closed.
---
Is it not crppped in for you?
---
I love the Polaris + dust rock combo!
---
I recently did my first leviathan through the destiny app. If you don‚Äôt know what to do, look for a group of other first timers.
---
Usually you‚Äôll get a few veterans in their that‚Äôll help out. 
---
Or look on YouTube for tutorials.
---
So you're saying put NPCs in the game that you can do bounties for to obtain mods that would be specific to certain  weapons?
---
&gt; absolutely shockingvthe amount of crap loot which is palmed out to you in this game
---
What were you expecting?  That's normal in this type of game (be it The Division, Borderlands, etc).
---
Houndish and rickkhakis has some YouTube tutorials on the raids and there are some lfg posts that don't mind teaching
---
What platform are you on. If your on PC are you using a controller? If so what controller?
---
I think the cap is 20-21 running an exotic with bonus stat + traction + all stat mods. 
---
Hold on, how does one equip two kinetic weapon at the same time? 
---
Yeah and it works. I don't use the well of radiance without it, or lunafactions 
---
i realized after the fact lmfao
---
Some specific perks can roll on just some of the armor slots - for example "Hand Cannon Loader" can only roll on Hands/Gloves.
---
There might be some good synergies in between grenade cooldown mods and perks that reduce grenade cooldown, Sunbracers are pretty fun tho!
---
It is very possible you may have gotten it but not noticed it. Or you may have been alt-tabbed, or have been using ESC or another button when it appeared(closing it out before you noticed it). I really dont know, as it has not happened to me, and I do not know when or where it appears. The message from my understanding appears in game after you choose your character. For my friend it was "crucible access restricted"(I do not know it if was when he tried to play a game, or if that was the ban message)
---
It is entirely possible it could also be something else, as the crucible ban made no mention either way about equipment lock out( I have no clue if the person I know had crucible gear locked out or not). I think the evidence though is highly supportive of my conclusion though.
---
The only other thing I can think of, would be if you happened to play with people who were network manipulating or something like that, but from what I can tell looking at your game history, that does not seem to be the case. Seeing as your last crucible game was on the 12th, you probably would regain access around the 26th-28th if it is indeed the 2 week ban for network connection.
---
Yep. 20. 
---
Nice work, Guardian 
---
Yes, the vast majority of items are random drops. 
---
It‚Äôs not like a bug. As how they explained it it‚Äôs a fundamental flaw with how Mercury was built as a map. Not something they can fix post-launch.
---
Hell yeah I run this on my characters too
---
r/woooosh
---
Yes.  Supers break that immunity shield, and suppressive abilities (Tether, sentinel nades, and Tractor Cannon) stop the beam if you hit the one using the beam.
---
Point proven, I suppose.
---
dope. thanks for the tips!
---
They're not very comparable games. Both are looter shooters, but that's where the similarities end, and theres not all that much overlap with the player bases.
---
Ok ty very much for taking your time on helping me
---
&gt;I'd love to know where I said there is no damage drop-off over range
---
Literally right above that sentence:
---
&gt;Range doesn't affect time to kill
---
Because those two sentences are undeniably mutually exclusive. By definition: damage drop-off over range means that you do less damage over a greater distance. What is the one thing that directly affects shots to kill OR time to kill?
---
Warning: we're getting dangerously close to you looking like you don't understand basic math at this point.
---
I don't if Skull of dire ahamkara got a buff or I just never used it but I tried it a couple days ago and yeah it's pretty good after the Nova bomb buff
---
Im gonna be banking them ogres if that the case. Is she bringing an invader friend?
---
Why ya gotta do this to me?
---
No it‚Äôs not, mountaintop is a pinnacle weapon just the same 
---
**FOR WHAT CHARACTER CLASS WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE THE NEXT BUILD?**
---
let me know :-)
---
Is it bad?
---
As far as I'm concerned, there are no Baron class items.  And even if they were, they sure as hell can't decrypt from Legendary engrams or drop from legendary loot drop sources.  Each class has a baron helmet and chest piece.
---
I would say use your mod card and give yourselves a favorable singe + heavyweight for more heavy ammo drops along with no negative modifiers and zero handicap.  Your score will suck, but at least you'll make it through.
---
So what's it take for a build to get a 5 \* requirement cost?  A forsaken exotic?   (I ask because of the inclusion of raid gear, which pushes the limits for average-joe players)
---
yeah, trying to run with a titan and a hunter for the triumph
---
IMHO it was a good start for some Overlord. That may do good, get out of hand, do bad, ... Just a huge possible story arc, that was completely missed.
---
We all have really bad luck on drops. Its part pf the game. 
---
I hadnt played on ps4 since well before forsaken. 
---
I hit 650 in 7 days on pc. 8 days for all 3. 
---
I came back To ps4 maybe 17 days ago.  I was 380 LL. 
---
This was done with one character 
---
I could hav been 650 in 15-16 days, but i havent rushed it as I am a little burnt out. 
---
This was done without any thunderlord or any other 650 drops.
---
All done with weekly‚Äôs, daily‚Äôs, primes, bounties, and 2 raids. 
---
This week i did a few bounties and a few primes and I am 649 after today.
---
Still have both raids and several weekly‚Äôs/daily‚Äôs. 
---
There is a correct way and wrong way to level. 
---
There is a strategy to it. 
---
Certain drops are higher LL than others. 
---
There is q time to chase low LL gains. 
---
There is a time to chase the bigger LL drops. 
---
Damn nice!!!
---
Weapon quests no longer go away and they do not reset back to the beginning either.  You will keep your overall progression on the quest, unless the specific step you are on is to "do "X" in a single season".  When that is the case, that specific step resets to the beginning because it is no longer "in a single seaon".  For example, Luna's, Redrix, and Mountain top all have a quest step of reach "XXX" valor/glory rank" or "rest your valor/glory X times" in a single season.  For these steps you will start over at 0 rank on the first reset for the season.  So if you are close, you want to grind that out before the new season starts.
---
I always kinda wanted to pick up other weapons in the game just for the fun of it. Use other weapons i can't get but pick up.
---
It feels kinda broken tbh the opening shot makes even aiming in the rough direction a headshot
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ you should never say the ‚ÄúF‚Äù word. Your news feed will be filled with nothing but!!
---
Daaaamn Danielle!
---
The link generates itself. I just typed the word since this is what ppl do on Reddit.
---
What cinematics?
---
One of the reasons why I set my account to only accept messages from people on my FL.
---
Yeah in this case it would be Forsaken exotic as a armor piece - both of these exotics are pretty easy to get and both are sold by Xur.
---
By the way, thanks for asking &lt;3
---
Keep your two primaries when you solo, if you feel most comfortable with them. But usually, if you‚Äôre doing a team activity, shotguns are the way to go.
---
I know that you don‚Äôt like the range on some shotguns, but guns like Dust Rock Blues and Retold Tale have decent range to them. I‚Äôd try those out and see if that fixes your dislike of range.
---
I agree that there is a expectation that you should use a special, and that you are expected to use primary/special/heavy combo. That‚Äôs because many people play like that, enjoy it, and expect others to use the same combo, even if it doesn‚Äôt suit them.
---
Do what you enjoy. While you will get some criticism from it, prove that you won‚Äôt be a liability to your team. Try out those shotguns I recommended and see if they suit your fancy. If not, keep on double primary. 
---
If it‚Äôs fun for you, do it. 
---
Let's be honest.  92.5% of memes are bad, so you didn't stand much of a chance.

I've been laid off by a gaming company before.
---
I know what it's like to work hard, months of crunch time, to make a ship date. And our reward is not a bonus check, not royalties, not a launch party, not even a thank you, but instead a pink slip. Because once that disc is on store shelves, we're just so much dead weight. You don't have to have worked for a development studio, though, to have read enough stories to know that this is utterly, utterly common. They're easy to find, and every major publisher is guilty as hell, (with *perhaps* one exception being Nintendo?)
---
So I'm completely "contrary" to Activision's -- and others' -- attitude that laying off huge swathes of people, not as an emergency matter, but just as a normal pay of their course of business. It is indefensible! 
---
Their CFO gout a fifteen *million* dollar bonus, and then they let 800 people go. There is no basement dwelling about it. 
---
You may have noticed huge crowds of literally everyone who are all being contrary together. You're maybe not the one who's woke, the one who's red-pilled, the one who's most informed person on this matter. Maybe though, you are an apologist for corporate greed.
---
Yes
---
But you already bought the game, dlcs, and annual pass. They won way before right now. I know I‚Äôm being played but for me it‚Äôs honestly too fun to stop

A metric ass is a very specific unit of measurement. Can you elaborate on your personal experience with previous metric asses? (Asking for school project)
---
Yep, in Warframe you farm for schematics and resources to build those schematics.  *Then* you farm for mods and the endo to upgrade those mods.  Then you farm XP on items to re-level them after you forma them so you can put more/bigger mods in them.
---
Mmhm, it's a fighter subclass called gunslinger
---
Prusa i3 mk3, slic3r
---
&gt;  Getting light level cap is pretty trivial after 1 650
---
Yeah, I am starting to get the feeling I really should have focused on a single character then used the 650 weapons from that one to give the others a boost.  Instead I kept them all within ~10 points of each other.
---
Live and learn I guess...lol
---
Thank you for the reply!
---
Everybody knows heroic events are complete RNG
---
This is rad.

High hopes. Won‚Äôt see another dime from me until Trials is back. Can you honestly say it‚Äôs fair? (The Trials Scenario) Competitive is the only thing PvP players have. Quickplay sucks. IMO. All I do is play Comp. I only play PvE when I need gear for PvP. That‚Äôs not just me either. There are tons of other people that play just like that. I understand everyone has their different reasons on why they play the game but for the people that play it for the PvP I personally don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair.
