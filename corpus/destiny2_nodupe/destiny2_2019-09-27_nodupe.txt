Garbage. I had a blast getting recluse, revoker and the grenade launcher a week apart from one another. Was looking forward to new pinniacle üòêüòêüòë
---
---
---
What you mean gaueanteed curated roll? These weapons will have unique perks tied to them like pinnacle weapons did ?
---
Scarred the crap out of me, lucky I was already in the process of pushing it out.
---
For Steam I'm assuming? It tells you when you hit the download button but before you commit to actually downloading it.
---
Then id say go for it
---
Those weapons are in different slots: you void equip them both, if you wanted. 
---

---
What exactly are you trying to do? Find the best PVE hand cannon or something else?
---
Nope. No more unique perks. Just guaranteed to have a good roll when you finish the quest lol
---
Wow, how dare they steal your portal dude.  I guess they should just know that they should let you do whatever the hell you want despite paying the same amount for the game and having the same right to invade as you.   I hope you realize just how much of an a$$ you sound like in your post.
---
And Tuesday they switch over to one-at-a-time dismantle. Double F for that one. 
---
F
---
Holy shit reddit is so helpful
---
This should not be possible and the fact that it is absolutely perplex's me. Bungie why?
---
Yeah that would help I can‚Äôt do it like tonight or tomorrow though it would have to be Saturday
---
Probably not. I think they said it wasn't as popular as it could have been, and they didn't want to keep using the resources for it.
---
But Recluse nerfs tho
---
Yeah for Steam and that's a good idea thanks.
---
I saw this at a stop and shop last night lmfao
---
Yay a scout now buff them in pvp
---
I've always wanted that
---
YES!! Someone said it!!
---
All bounties except clan, gunsmith and eververse will be reset when maintenance begins on September 30th.
---
O.M.G.
---
Us Titans have
---
1. Whiffed hammers.
---
2. Failed Fist of Panic.
---
3. Clipping the *air* and detonating with missile. 
---
4. Gangbanged in our own bubbles. 
---
All guardians feel pain lol
---
‚ÄúIght ima head out‚Äù
---
If I haven't gotten one of the subclasses on my titan though, will I have to buy forsaken just to get his new subclass?
---
I'm glad I got to try out that method before it got axed.  Got me 990-odd Dusklight and a good night's sleep.  It was a bit degenerate, though.
---
My entire clan quit playing destiny when bl3 came out
---
Arcstriders need blink.
---
Every kill with sleeper felt like a tribute to a dark primordial god.
---
Eris Dog
---
Exotics are dropped through RNG right? So buying an expansion doesnt neccesarily mean that I will earn them quickly?
---
Forsaken subclasses are included in shadowkeep
---
Why do people force themselves on relationships with dicks that don't respect their hobbies and interests? If someone is being an asshole I'd assume it's not that hard to move on and find better people.
---
More good shit. Much more
---
This doesn't explain what charges are or what they do
---
I‚Äôm sure that Bungie would‚Äôve been able to course correct, but if they hadn‚Äôt already proved themselves capable, I would‚Äôve probably abandoned the franchise.  As for Anthem, there‚Äôs a lesson to be learned.  People will usually lose all faith in an organization after two major fuck ups in a row.  BioWare fucked up MA Andromeda and they fucked up Anthem and now nobody exits them to make good games anymore.  If Forsaken had been a flop, Destiny 2 would‚Äôve probably become almost completely abandoned by now.
---
Holy- nice coloring dude!
---
They just aren‚Äôt making anymore pinnacles. Just rituals from this point on. Old pinnacle quests will still be available.
---
&gt;Spider selling ALL mats
---
&gt;Shattered Throne available 24/7
---
&gt;Shattered Throne and Forge access from Director
---
Am I secretly in a coma and living a dream?
---
You posted twice (:
---
No Forsaken campaign?
---
I‚Äôve had people where the encounter is failed one time and they begin screaming about who doesn‚Äôt know the encounter and then proceeds to talk to everyone like they‚Äôre five years old. Have not been back raiding since.
---
If you think about it they‚Äôre the most oppressed class, but they‚Äôre all scum bags so they deserve it :)
---
All of this depends on what you're using it for.
---
Bane of sorrow is deece for pve major clear. It bounces a bit too much for pvp tho
---
21% is gambit the gun for a reason
---
Fixed odds is in the same boat as bane, but 21% demolishes it in add clear
---
Now you can drop more powerfull engrams. Probably more milestones and better powerfull drops.
---
Or it‚Äôs just an iDog 11
---
Congrats! Have fun never using it :D
---
&gt;Save
---
Thanks!
---
I really like how the MG and Scout look. Gambit gun looks pretty good too.
---
Most. Despised. Exotic.
---
Lmao
---
Sauce is layers of white
---
Make strafe jump directionally controlled, like how what direction you look at while blinking determines what angle and direction you blink to
---
Love the idea of the curated rolls as long as some weapons get another ‚Äúbalance‚Äù. Like why use exit strategy when I have a recluse?
---
Or he is better at it then you
---
But the you will miss out on that sweet dopamine rush
---
Someone made a comment or post a few weeks ago about getting rid of weapons or something with engrams since all of that was going away?  I didn't pay much attention to it since I didn't know what it meant, but now that the release is so close, I don't want to miss out if there's some benefit I don't understand.
---
To be honest, videos do very little to help. A good Sherpa can explain it and walk you through it than any video can. Videos are a little tiny piece compared to actually doing it
---
At least match em up with other laggy players. How can you play the game without any pvp?
---
I‚Äôm still working on that quest do you remember what the last step is
---
Dude, Recluse is literally a re-skin if red mamba
---
Well if they pushed it back for stability I would be happy bc they‚Äôre trying to push a finalized product but to push back for the sake of pushing back, I would‚Äôve been sad lol
---
Yeah that one is dope.
---
At the cost of infinite planet resources from forges.
---
**A soul, for a soul**
---
I have two other friends that play, that's enough for a fireteam so that's good enough for me.
---
To each his own.
---
Where the fuck did this piano come from
---
Thundercrash is shit literally anywhere, dude.
---
I know how time zones work but I read your response and interpreted it a different way I‚Äôm sorry you won and are the superior being
---
Auto reload will not exist on any weapon other than Whisper. No auto reload hurts mountaintop more than any other weapon. 
---
The new meta is probably going to be Izanagi‚Äôs Burden, Recluse and a spike GL, Supremacy with max mag + triple tap, Recluse and Whisper or primary kinetic, Fourth Time‚Äôs the Charm + Firing Line Sole Survivor (or new raid sniper, if it can roll those) and Whisper. 
---
Izanagi currently puts out more than double the DPS of mountaintop when you remove auto reload and substitute for max reload speed, and rapid fire snipers currently have higher DPS as well. This is before snipers get an additional 20% damage buff.
---
Been saying this for a while, yes!
---
I‚Äôve never got one, do I have to do some special quest or something before they start to drop?
---
Who tf is randy
---
Yeah it has the same build, but the point is every gun is the same type as the ones in season 6
---
Now I want light level as an option over player head.
---
It‚Äôs included on the preload for destiny
---
r/fireteams
---
It is preloaded with new light, even with only new light you still have to download all content. When buying Forsaken/shadowkeek you are only purchasing licenses that give you access to content already installed.
---
Good job fam may it be the first of many :D
---
I pre loaded new light first, are you sure?
---
It says not installed.
---
Rampage outlaw always best for me. I can never live without it
---
From the TWAB
---
‚ÄúRight now, all PC players can pre-load Destiny 2 on Steam, which includes pre-loading for New Light and Shadowkeep. Since New Light makes Destiny 2 accessible to everyone for free, no purchase is necessary to pre-load.‚Äù
---
Thats for body shots basically due to the minor head shot damage being nerfed making the head shots less but body shot worth more. Crit hits will still do more damage then body but the 30% damage increase is to compensate for that as it is for all the gun buffs.
---
Old pinnacles aren‚Äôt being removed. Their quests will stay the same, but there aren‚Äôt new pinnacles next season. That said, when shadowkeep drops next week and the new season begins your glory will be set back to 0. So you should finish that grind before Monday so you don‚Äôt have to start again!
---
Reset is next week so you won't get bonus points, as the season resets.
---
You'll most likely have to go 2100 yourself if you still want recluse
---
Ok, thank you
---
Ty for the answer, okay gonna try my luck and see if I can reach 2100
---
The best thing is when some one quits because you are losing but you manage to turn it around and win with a man down.
---
What are the ones on the right?
---
You‚Äôre welcome. Best of luck, guardian!
---
FrostBolt üòÇ
---
You‚Äôre coloring that! This is amazing! How is this possible? Best I can do is a rough sketch.
---
They‚Äôll get nerfed next season no doubt.
---
Yep, so there are 2 ways to get exotics. One is a regular drop via RNG, this you get by simply playing the game's  various activities. Let's call them "common exotics". This is the common loot pool that all players will get, even f2p.  
---
The other way to get exotics is through an exotic quest. This has nothing to do with RNG and will require you to play a series of missions/objectives that will reward the exotic guaranteed at the end of the quest chain. These exotics are tied to their respective expansions only, and are thus unobtainable if you do not own those seasons
---
I got recluse a long time ago then got lunas howl, redrix, and revoker all in one week and it was a fun time for the most part. Kinda sad my only other experience like that could be for mountaintop but that's just not at all something I want to do.
---
2 and theyre big assholes, cant deny theyre mine lol
---
This is what I miss for being on night shift. I really only play between 6 pm and 8 am so no one is hanging out. The only notable person I saw recently was some chill australian guy and he was wondering why I was up so late lmao.
---
Trying comp only to find out that I am in fact a Guardian III based on my skill.  Someone has to be in that bottom bracket.   It is probably me.
---
OEM Titans don't allow fun in the crucible. In their eye it's an arena to drain the happiness from all who enter.
---
People in tier 1 gear would at least be communicating what they want to do, my original post conceded multiple people with the same role on. You also ignored my argument that there‚Äôs a forced tutorial on everything regardless of the armor glow, so yeah, no need to inspect and see what armor does. 
---
You‚Äôll invade as reaper or sentry IF NO ONE GRABS THE PORTAL. You see an invader by it you gonna fight them to invade first with your no-invasion-benefit armor? That‚Äôs the entire point of the original post. 
---
I‚Äôm that guy. The one by the first portal bc I‚Äôm supposed to be. Don‚Äôt argue for the person who has been told by the drifter what armor does and and has a quest telling them to go get it after their first match. It‚Äôs even worse for invasions when they are a limited occurrence. 
---
I initially thought gambit itself was the reason for frustration, but this defense of willful ignorance of prime and its mechanics have changed my mind as to why the mode is even suffering. Then those people playing ‚Äúhow they have the right to‚Äù cry that 4 stacks stomp them when they‚Äôre not even trying to learn the correct way to play. 
---
The massive upvotes of the original post show your ‚Äúno gear no problem‚Äù mentality is in the minority.
---
Oh, thans man.
---
Welcome and btw, moon's haunted.

Ahhh yes you can access the forge from the director but you still have to see ada to get your frame dammit

I guess people gotta complain about something, huh?

man dat shyt was hella easy. wut you need like 4 deaths to remove the progress of one fkin kill. thats some baby shit compared to D1.
---
There r 3 different ones I believe but it's basically bungie.net/hope or dust or whatever
---
Doesn't say never though. Hold out hope for the future!
---
Yes
---
no unfortunately, im on ps4
---
you lose more Valor quitting before the match has ended xddddd

I met a guy with 69 LW clears, and he always left after riven so it would stay at 69 forever.

What about when the bullets are flying at me before my spawning animation even finishes?

That's always fun...

Came here to say this!

They're not rocks! They're minerals!

I get baboon 4 times a day...

Whilst we love and congratulate your achievement, this isn't a direct screenshot, so I'll have to lock this post.
---
Forced on us by the tribute hall wiping us out of all mats and shards
---
BIG YES
---
You will only very the first year. You will have to buy forsaken. I'm sure it will be available on steam after the launch
---
Great no special perks, that removes the fun
---
That Gambit gun looks sexy, though.
---
Got a titan to level 50 with 10 resilience and it is amazing, in supers its... Pretty hard to die lol. But with my lock's blink and devower  I  find that to save my ass more so than being tanky.
---
Forsaken will be able to purchase once the game launches on Steam, it's not included with Shadowkeep.
---
Even without the DLC, all players will be able to play Forsaken/Annual Pass content and earn rewards. Buying Forsaken will get you access to its campaign and Year 2 exotic quests and items.
---
Yeah Price Tags 4 was pretty good
---
Sucked alll the fun right out didn't they? Dude imagine if hush didn't have archer's gambit. Who wants a curated roll? The grind isn't worth it unless it's different or better.
---
So what I'm getting from this t
---
Is the the subclasses will be available to everyone that owns shadowkeep without having to do the activities they were bound to like blind well in forsaken?
---
it will change to your steam name
---
I've only done Leviathan 2 times. And that was back when it was released. I feel the pain
---
‚Äúggwp‚Äù win or lose
---
*laughs in suppressor grenade sentinel mastersubclass*

Thank you lol nothing big then

Some guy leaves a game and then you join in, all enemy guardians have their supers and it‚Äôs 19-57

Back on October 1st. 
---
http://www.bungie.net/endure
---
I was literally touching cloth right there.
---
Damn I could have sworn it said PVP when I originally read that , as well as aztecross saying something about it.
---
Isn't the new raid called Garden of Salvation?
---
Do you have a source for that?
---
So if i complete the mountaintop quest in shadowkeep i will the weapon right?
---
Pinnacle weapons aren‚Äôt going away, they‚Äôre just not going to be making more with unique perks like master of arms, killing tally, mag howl etc. the way I read it is they‚Äôre instead making what are basically curated rolls for new ‚Äúritual weapons‚Äù which are a single roll weapon with probably some unique combo of perks that are already available.
---
Is it really? I heard aztecross saying it needed one , and it certainly does. It used to be my go-to in pve with my devour warlock. Made me a thicc space wizard.
---
Yeah, i don't think they'll remove the old quests. Especially since they just adjusted the quests a few weeks ago. It would be astronomically stupid to make things like mountaintop or recluse or wendigo unobtainable. Or since autos and scout are getting buffed, removing breakneck or oxygen.
---
However, Bungie are no strangers to making astronomically stupid decisions.
---
The wording in the twab is... worrying. At best.
---
Also, even if the do decide to remove the quests from the vendors I do not think they'd remove it from your inventory.
---
Yaaay, I‚Äôve missed using ace but my recluse MT just did so much better,
---
Lots of talk but nothing official about any nerf to recluse perk, where have you got this?
---
Yeah it's going to hit for 19/31.5
---
The only subclasses that are bad for PvE are basically all the arc ones tbh, but even then hunters Arc subclass gets some good use in one two punch shot guns liars handshake and combination blow, but that‚Äôs very niche.
---
Yes, always available
---
That gun is going to be super good still I hope at least. going to try it out in the new DLC story.
---
 re¬∑ward/r…ôÀàw√¥rd/ *noun*
---
1. a thing given in recognition of one's service, effort, or achievement.
---
Nowhere in the definition of reward is it stated that it is given for *free*. It is simply given to say "Hey, you did a thing, good job, have this as a prize." They can charge you for it all they want, it is still a reward by definition. Just because most of the time we get rewards for free doesn't mean they *have* to be free
---
When is D2 F2P on ps4 ?
---
Yep totally agree it's why I avoid gambit and pvp completely
---
Oh this is pretty cool, was not aware of it.
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
\&gt;be an arcstrider
---
\&gt;see an enemy running away from you
---
\&gt;"the frick you running mh?you can't escape my big staff   ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)"
---
\&gt;launch the staff
---
\&gt;you get a triple kill because the javelin bounced off of the enemy's head and hitted other two enemies"
---
You'll have any items your've obtained on another platform through cross-save. 
---
Purchases, such as DLC will not be carried over through cross-save, however since Destiny is going f2p you wont have to buy the base game, Curse of Osiris or Warmind. You'll also have access to certain parts of the latter DLCs, not the story driven objectives etc. You also wont have access to the Y2 Exotics.
---
You'll have to buy Forsaken, as well as Shadowkeep if you want the remaining content
---
Lucky me, i mostly care about sunbreaker and sentinel.
---
The TWAB released last night.
---
So if I own pinnacle weapons will they just need them for pve use but PvP use no.
---
Plus will they make my pinnacle weapons I have now add random rolls on it, or keep it the same.
---
I though it would fade to the Skyrim intro.
---
My precious tokens are safe though right?
---
I may not be good at PvP but I will not quit a match
---
You already know the answer to the question you ask. I will help anyways.....
---
"Yes."
---
COS jacket was a real looker. This one is pretty ugly in comparison.
---
It‚Äôs even worse
---
All damage increasing perks are getting nerfed (except Huckleberry), so anything that would directly replace the Recluse will be worse as well. But with the overall buff nearly all primary weapons are getting to base damage in PvE, the Recluse (and other weapons with damage boosting perks) are likely to do very similar damage to currently, just the weapons without damage boosting perks will be a lot closer.
---
Done =D
---
Short question what if my buddy is level 24 is he jumped straight up to 50 and 750 also!?
---
What about code of the missile?
---
Maybe a tiny bit of overshield too, like a quarter or something
---
Wow, I've never seen this before..
---
Awesome, thanks.
---
Looks great
---
It wasn‚Äôt me but it depends on what you consider a reskin. Edgewise looks very different to me. They reused the ammo belt and can but everything else looks different to me.  https://images.app.goo.gl/aiJ3bZkGXpS1bg5s7

entire guide, same process for forge farming, lower light level, set date back, whatever.

I dont have a high horse, I never said it wouldn't have been found without me.

I don't need to realise anything.

I came up with forge farming, and I don't like it. I'm glad it's gone. That's 100% true.

You can throw your javelin at at any time and it goes through all shields and explodes on impact but the cost is it instantly ends your super

If you're supporting him he has no right to tell you what you can and can't buy in my opinion. If you can afford it, treat yourself.

Hopefully we'll see come 01/10.

Delerium is a 100% reskin of avalanche though
---
It was in the intro mission when you lost your light and you were walking on the mountain with luis guiding you to hawthorn.

The timer after is designed for those who want to run around and look for lore.

Hmm yea, that should b right!

Take a nap before playing and eat a well balanced breakfast.  That way you will have sufficient energy!

---
 5 days left to grind the last 3 i still need but fortunately no more glory needed
---
Yessir
---
Oh, sorry then
---
With the changes to enemies health and the weapon pools various buffs/nerf it should balance out since even red bar mobs will be a little tougher. Though personally I think we won‚Äôt know for sure till we touch down on release.
---
Does someone also know if loot drops in new light content will be higher than light 750? Or is that just shadowkeep?
---
Always love seeing art like this.
---
That's what I've been doing. I'm just getting to the end of my supply.
---
It‚Äôs like providing a counter argument to people who said those three weapons were balanced, it‚Äôs arguing with a brick wall about why being unbalanced is bad, the wall won‚Äôt listen
---
Ah ok, so you‚Äôre asking once you‚Äôre out of synths can you still get weapons? You absolutely can, so continue to farm my friend!
---
Great. Thanks.
---
Well there will be no new Pinnacle weapons are coming out there being replace with Ritual weapons. Which are just curated weapons with no pinnacle perks. Plus the ones we got now are being nerf so bye bye pinnacle weapons.
---
You can still get the pinnacle weapons that exist
---
Same here in Philippines
---
Ad hominem and still no argument. Nobody but you is talking about D1 weapons. We‚Äôre talking about Rampage and Kill Clip; stay on topic.
---
You‚Äôre saying they need nerfs because they‚Äôre overpowered? In what context? The context is that the other perks suck ass and these are the best in slot perks for primary weapons. So we need new perks that actually offer competitive benefits and make us want to move away from the damage perks; gutting them doesn‚Äôt solve the problem at all because they‚Äôre *still the best perks* regardless of the nerf. NOBODY is going to switch to Pulse Monitor or Slideshot just because Rampage is slightly less dominant.
---
Worst thing is getting errors like buffalo or weasel or any of those other weird errors when your team is winning and being unable to rejoin at the end which results in a forfeit on you on a win you should have gotten.
---
Looks like knuckles from Sonic boom haha
---
Gg surrender at 20
---
Well let‚Äôs use Bungie‚Äôs example, Crowd Control was never a god roll perk and yet it was a good perk, rampage or it‚Äôs ilk are REQUIRED perks to have viable weapons
---
The argument ends there
---
Y  are you using crimson
---
That‚Äôs pretty cool!
---
Meh.  LGD!
---
GLHF
---
Yes.  Let's make a joke about a tragedy.  That is the greatest idea and is surely the best form of humor. /s
---
Screenshots on destiny always are incredible, nice job!
---
welp the mountaintop recluse powercreep was definitely getting out of hand though
---
That's not accurate. The right answer is it depends. I hate the people who make a habit of constantly dropping the second there on a team that starts getting behind by even just like 10-15 kills. Even if it's in the first couple min of the game with plenty of time to make a comeback. There thr people that warrant complaints. 
---
"ooohh boo hoo I'm quitting cause I'm not winning immediately.".
---
Now if someone quits because there getting spawn trapped and the other team is just wiping the floor with them and there way behind, and there is almost no chance of coming back.   Then I'm fine with it. No prob.  Complaints are unwarranted. 
---
So. It just depends.
---
Discovering the Dreaming City was one of the coolest things about forsaken. You go from this war-torn mumbo jumbo of a place to a beautiful palace (? Castle?) with a ton to explore
---
Recluse yourself
---
Thundercrash+Vex ceilings. We get it.
---
Vault of Glass for me. Black Garden is a very close second though.
---
As a PC player I'm really sad about the whole nerf to magnificent howl. I grinded half an eternity to get my NF and it's a bit frustrating that this gun is mediocre at best.
---
Worst part is that the nerfs made it completely worthless in PvE.
---
The completionist in me didn't allow that but what i'm really mad is that they give an alternative to crucible but not to gambit
---
I love them shoulder pads
---
&gt;Guardians were hard dying
---
um... phrasing?... are we like done with that now?
---
Submitting 3rd place, weirdchamp
---
I honestly put all the blame on Bungie, the need to make quests like that have an objective like ‚ÄúBank X motes‚Äù not just ‚ÄúPlay X games‚Äù.
---
Ooof
---
I switched to PC in March and I have all of these. None of these are timed exclusives, you should have replaced the forge weapons with y1 faction weapons
---
I almost exclusively run Missile Titan in PvP. I think I‚Äôve been killed by a thundercrash twice since forsaken came out.
---
Gotcha, so in other words: the annual pass is only available now with the deluxe edition of shadowkeep
---
Glad Huckleberry is going to be getting some extra lovin'. Ive been using it ever since I didn't care enough to get recluse.
---
in shadowkeep they are bringing back the Gjallarhorn as a weapon of sorrow called the "deathbringer"(only weapons of sorrow look like they want to eat your ass out through your lungs here is a picture [https://i.imgur.com/nN8idU6.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/nN8idU6.jpg) see what I mean)... also im pretty sure it will only be available for a short time like the year 1 Gjallarhorn from destiny 1 or the ashbringer from world of warcraft... but the Gjallarhorn will at least stay in your inventory
---
As far as I know october 1 it goes free all dlc included save Sk of course
---
Uh oh...someone didn't read...
---
Yes, but it will cost more overall than buying the SKU that contains the four season passes iirc
---
Being over leveled means basically nothing. You do a tiny bit more damage, but you can be 50 power over the enemies or 800 over and the experience will be literally identical.
---
r/hudlessdestiny
---
good luck my guy!
---
Same
---
Yea, the Shadowkeep Deluxe edition has a pass for all 4 seasons of Year 3. The regular edition of Shadowkeep comes with the first season pass, and the other 3 would need to be purchased individually.
---
This would be even better if they weren't nerfing the forge farm üò≠
---
What if they made a pinnacle rocket launcher that gave you bonus damage/fire rate/reload speed for every consecutive shot fired without swapping weapons. That sounds useful
---
If you don't finish the forsaken campaign and talisman missions, you'll be locked out of the dreaming city content (including raid)
---
leave 3312-A alone because I want him to not want to die when I impale him with a chainsaw
---
You do realize what controversial means right? It means it‚Äôs divisive and there‚Äôs little about the title that‚Äôs divisive at all
---
Forsaken will be available on steam after the Shadowkeep launch on October first.
---
Forsaken is not going free.
---
Yes I know what it‚Äôs from but it doesn‚Äôt apply here

I mean, we "technically" are. They are changing them and giving all pinnacles random rolls in order to dial back the power creep that they inevitably brought along with them. Honestly I can get behind the change if it means more balance and incentive to use actual exotics. I will say that it sucks to see that I got all the pinnacle weapons and they aren't going to be status symbols of my triumphs anymore, but then again a large portion of people who had them didn't work for them at all anyways.
---
Honestly isn‚Äôt even worth it

Well fuck

Yes, but only after a crippling nerf to roaming supers is implemented.
---
Mostly true.
---
You can actually play the raid if someone else hosts, even without the dreaming city unlocked.
---
But yes the rest won‚Äôt be accessible.

I swear that it sounds funny to say that. Comp at lower glory level easier than quickplay. Quickplay is full of high glory players who like to practice without risking glory. Plus the 6v6 in a 4v4 map creates pure chaos. Most of the time. I kill someone to find another guy already bearing down at me. Thats y i use oem. Not for the tracking but for overshield/damage buff. Relly good in quickplay. In comp i use other exo armor like synthocept or dunemarchers or lion rampant. Ull learn faster by playing comp. More 1v1 fights . quickplay is very annoying. Witu teamshooting and roaming supers. Trust me. Start in comp and when ur good at quickplay. Then ur ready to climb the glory ranks. But quitting mid game just messes with ur team. Suck it up and try to adapt to the situation.

[This](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/46376?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) was stated last season.  I hope this helps!

Sorry I didn't clarify it but I've only done base game up to Warmind so I don't know much behind that.

*Soundtrack intensifies*

So other than having to buy the future seasons individually, which I think are ~$10 and missing out on the wrist morne cosmetics, am I missing anything by not getting the annual pass?

'ritual' activities (strikes, gambit, crucible) are going to award brightdust for bounties. Ever verse items will dismantle into shards, and ur dust isnt going anywhere.

I'm trying to get back to destiny since I haven't played destiny 2 after leviathan. But was wonder do we get anything from migration or are we just free to play once we migrated to steam?
---
Curse of osiris Dlc was pretty terrible admittedly so most people won't end up having those unless they're in endgame and got nothing else to do then collect weapons and triumphs.
---
I've been playing since like 2months before forsaken got released and finished my osiris collection last week, since I never bothered to even go to that planet unless a bounty forced me to
---
This is very true iv been round since the beta havent stoped playing!
---
Absolutely not lmao
---
No not that dropping games isn't an issue worth upvoting, I mean this meme is trash
---
The Luna/Rally nerf is a good thing. It made PvE way too easy, particularly during boss fights. If a gun has a long reload or a small magazine size, it‚Äôs probably for good reason, and Luna‚Äôs/Rally bypassed those factors completely.
---
It‚Äôs recluse, you could use travelers chosen and still slay.
---
Literally anything is good with it
---
LMAO
---
One of the best looking games Ive ever played. Its beautiful.
---
Honestly this is the nuttiest thing I‚Äôve found in destiny. I come from wow where if you fuck up in a raid you can be kicked. I joined a destiny 2 raid absolutely no idea what I was doing (I was in the middle of reading the the boss fights online as I got accepted.) they asked had I done the raid before and I said no and they said that‚Äôs fine we‚Äôll give you the easy role and if I ever died and I said sorry they‚Äôd go ‚Äú it‚Äôs okay we probably should have explained that better, and then gave me some tips or an explanation (if needed) on what killed me. Was super nice of them and I really appreciated it.
---
Right because the competitive playlist is just dead on console right? No one is in there
---
Are you brain dead?
---
For pvp, alone as a god if you use controller or revoker/ bite of the fox if you use kbm. For pve, curated threat level is pretty good
---
i dont have a problem getting shards by just being on edz, its the datalattice that seems to take forever to accum/spawn
---
Recluse + Huckleberry + Peacekeepers = Nice‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
---
Have they even said how much their "effectiveness" is being reduced?
---
Yeah. For what it does and how it works, it should have a bigger mag.
---
Or just laugh because I wasn‚Äôt being serious considering I raid typically with my 7 yo scolding is highly frowned on.
---
no because the best pc players are miles ahead of the best console players, the competitive playlist is not the "competitive" of the game, sweats, scrims, and tournaments are.
---
You'll keep it.  They've made some repeatable bounties that award it.  This is neat because you can now finally play the game to get something from the eververse store.
---
Joining an active clan
---
Ugh I remember when he was nothing but an asshole in my Bungie forum group... dude needs to just stop.
---
This happened to me last night with an arcstrider. ARCSTRIDER!
---
LMAO this was me yesterday after listening to all the youtubers advise to hoarding them!
---
Ahahahahhahahahahaha, that‚Äôs the biggest half truth I‚Äôve ever seen
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs what happens when you have objectively superior hardware over a controller, no wonder your meta is brain dead weapons like recluse and mountaintop and ours is hand cannons
---
Long- medium range weapons as a primary is a good pair with recluse. 
---
Recluse can handle anything close range, but you may want a pluse,bow,sniper, etc for longer ranged enemies. 
---
I use a sniper for crucible and a bow for anything pve.
---
&gt;Ofc it can drop by being a good sport and not leaving matches you get stomped in.
---
So true, good point
---
*But striker titan!*
---
Sniper Primary, Chaperone w/ Spectral, Ace of Spades, pretty much anything is good with Recluse.
---
The Lumina quest. Forging our own exotic felt great
---
Basically, yes. We could have long form exotic quests tied to each activity that would normally have a pinnacle weapon quest.
---
Not when there‚Äôs so many other games out at the moment. That‚Äôs my personal opinion. To me, if I can save more time by skipping the leveling to the soft cap by turning in materials, I‚Äôd muuuuch rather do that. My fun is in hunting RNG I‚Äôm the raids or other pinnacle activities to achieve 950-960
---
Mine Downloaded pretty darn fast. On Battlenet it was a Slog downloading the game but on Steam it was swift. Maybe try pausing the download and restarting the pc, then try again.
---
Works wonderfully btw, no idea how since I live pretty far away from Turkey but thanks a lot
---
I just went from a Vizio 55‚Äù from 2012 to a Samsung Q70R. Hoooooolllllyyyyy shit does this game look good
---
Is all that from Forsaken?
---
Uh Oh. Looks like someones got a case of the Mondays.
---
Yeah
---
They made it easier to get it now. Look up some YouTube tip videos if you really want it even duh it won‚Äôt be too Tier dps when SK becomes live.
---
Thanks! I hadn't thought about stats or perks, but I think something like a massive increase to headshot damage for a short time after kills would be cool. It's not to spoopy, but oh well.

I'm actually wondering the impact Stadia will have on the consoles and gaming pc's.  If everything is browser based, then you won't need such high hardware requirements.  It'll be interesting to see...
---
No you had a stroke lmao

No telling how the nerfs will affect the gameplay with the other buffs coming to guns like auto rifles.

Yeah it was super badass.

Im in love with the fact that i've got 0 reasons to run whisper again since i got the catalyst done

This has happened to me like 1000x times. I've actually been killed by it and then spawn killed by it again in the next life :)

Nazarec‚Äôs Sin and The Recluse is my go to since I got to 2100
---
It's a great game, unless you're playing solo. I used LFG and the companion app looking for raid teams and nobody ever wanted to teach or if you do find a team, nobody knew what they were doing. Annoying playing as a solo player. I can't spend more money for a few weeks of playing only to stop once again.
---
Sorry, didn‚Äôt mean to brag. I was just very excited over this pin finally showing up.
---
When does this take effect?
---
I frikin love you
---
Question, I haven't played or bought destiny 2, if I want the complete experience, what would be the best course of action for me? Would the free version be enough for me? I'm on XBone S
---
There's also the fact that the traveler actually likes humanity, while Ghaul assumed it only wanted strong protectors. That's why he's confused about the traveler's silence after the prologue, and spends the rest of the campaign trying to discover what else he needs to do to prove the cabal are worthy. He doesn't want to just take the light by force since this is a matter of honor for him, but is forced to do it after learning the speaker can't help him and some dumbass guardian who got their light back is storming the ship.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Another thing that isn't very well explained is that the seemingly out-of-nowhere "traveler cage" was developed using light-extraction knowledge the cabal stole from the hive on Oryx's dreadnought back in D1. You'd only know this if you make the connection between [this mission in the first game](https://www.ishtar-collective.net/transcripts/outbound-signal), and this [scannable in the cabal ship on the EDZ](https://www.ishtar-collective.net/transcripts/ghost-scan-echion-hold-european-dead-zone).
---
Thats me atm. Actually i'm @ 50/100 rn. But i'm already fabled so fuck it. I will get this thing tonight.
---
Oh very helpful much thank
---
What is this?
---
Definitely. I believe there are some small lore pieces written from the Traveler‚Äôs perspective. My favorite is one where it says the the Traveler felt incredible joy when it found us.
---
 I mean I want the option to use the best looking exotic and still do the most DPS and also I spent DAYS getting the god rolls that allowed me to do the most DPS and now they are going to be rendered pretty much useless so I'm going to have to get to scrapping every last one so I can start from scratch... also learning boss mechanics is fun but if its a boss fight or encounter that is usually bullshit or if its an encounter that is not fun in any way like the "ripyerd###off hellhounds" or "Sadia the c###" it shouldn't take longer than normal... seriously at least the c### is skippable but the d### removing hellhounds cant be skipped I always end up just wanting to get past that encounter as fast as I can... thats why im pissed I don't want to have to get rid of all the guns I went through hell to get because they are going to rendered useless in the next update and im pissed because when I run those raids it would take longer in those 2 encounters the c### and d### removing hellhounds seriously what can replace 3 god rolls that I went through hell to get... I doubt its any new god rolls because those will basically stop existing after the update... its best to get rid of the god roll you may or may not have gone through hell to get because it will no longer be a god roll and god rolls will no longer exist

Forsaken will be available on steam after the Shadowkeep launch.
---
Ya it's a drop but when I go to pick it up it says "subclass full" and i can't figure out how to get rid of one of the crapy supers for it

Will it be the same with curse of osiris and warmind?

COO and Warmind are included with destiny as of October 1st

yes

I spent from the time I started playing D1 until about 2 months ago trying to find a raid team. As I said, I give up. I go hard gaming and the friends I did make playing Destiny were all never playing at the same time. The team's I found were all basically replacing a buddy and never hear from them again. That's the reality of my situation playing Destiny. It sucks because Bungie hooked me with Halo 1 with the gunplay and it's only got better with time. Unless the best content becomes matchmaking friendly, I don't see me playing ever again. I also understand that the best content can't be matchmaking because of trolls, afkers blatant a holes etc. Therefore I retire unless someone gifts me it. It's literally the only way I'd play again. It's been a very disappointing experience since launch unfortunately. I'll enjoy it through Twitch and see where it goes. I may comeback again but I will wait until it's free this time  haha In all seriousness though. I don't care about the money, I care about spending the money and having the experience that I had. I would support Bungie very easily but the game can't cater to solo players. The content I'd be paying for is the same as everyone else but I'm not getting the experience that everyone else gets to have. I'm quite certain that I'm not the only Destiny veteran in this situation either.
---
Dude, such a weird feeling right now.
---
Like, log in and play the game and it feels familiar, because we've been playing Forsaken since September of last year. And in just a few days the game will be completely different.
---
It's wild.
---
I'm already fabled too, but I don't want to have to hit Fabled again next season.
---
maybe its on the second page

....xur- exists for 5 years

You- who?
---
I know that the valor step for sure is retroactive because it‚Äôs tied to the triumph. Also I‚Äôve had that quest for several seasons, since it was released, and have done like 1 step per season just casually, and it hasn‚Äôt ever fully reset the whole line.
---
ALL HAIL THE MAGIC CONCH!!!

Besides from Red Dead Redemption 2, this is probably one of the best looking games I‚Äôve ever seen. Such a beautiful game. Can‚Äôt wait to see the updated Moon.

You damn well know he means sucking !!!!!!

They already said soft cap is 900 hard cap is 960 I believe, check out the this week at bungie it tells you exactly what it‚Äôs gonna be. My fault had a tooth pulled after reading it I‚Äôm drawing blanks.

I have gone to xur, he just never had it every time
---
No, thats just chest of alpha lupi am afraid. It looks like that on the back.

thanks man beautiful answer
---
I have the one with Lord Saladin one from Rise of Iron on my PS4. Pretty dope dude. I should switch to yours lol
---
Did you cut it open and try it on??
---
So full trasnparancy I have all Pinnacle crucible guns except for NF.  Mad I gotta say even using Luna's howl is fun.  And yes it is still a high skill weapon. MT and R is like... Just pressing the easy button in crucible.  It's not fun. I used them for all of like 2 weeks and went back to thorn and Tartara because that was actually fun and not fkin easy mode. Using LH is the same.  You don't insta kill everyone with it.  I just regret not using it when it was thee best gun in the game.  I feel that keeping the fire rate but returning magnificent howl to how it was is beyond acceptable now.

Can't justify paying 60 bucks plus the price of another season pass just to make the number next to my power level go up another 50 points and all the gear I just spent months grinding for to be obsolete again. I've been doing it since D1. I'm not gonna keep paying money to do the same thing over and over. Just because they put the name Shadowkeep next to it and added a DLC, why should I pay another 60 bucks for Destiny 2 again? I shouldn't have to pay another 60 bucks until Destiny 3. I'm good. They are very underhandedly turning it into an ongoing subscription service and I'd rather spend my money elsewhere.

Ya, the primary's in d2 are trash compared to secondary energy weapons.

Playing patrol while smoking weed is one of my favorite things to do on Destiny, it really dials the atmosphere up to 11 and highlights how well the world building went about making all the locations.
