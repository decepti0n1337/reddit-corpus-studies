Exotic hand cannon. It‚Äôs from one of the vanilla planet quests. Really good for headshots, packs a hard punch
---
---
---
I‚Äôm not mad at what to do I‚Äôm mad that this is the third thing I have to do. I just want the gun already
---
It isn't a Luna's howl for sure but it is very effective. Insane stability and instant death if you manage to land 5 body shots on an opponent and they're still not dead. In Gambit it's excellent as you would expect and in day to day PvE it can be pretty alright. It's definitely not OP by any stretch of the definition, but it's got fantastic fun factor. Keep up the grind!
---
it's really not that hard...plus ur missing out on a whole nother gameplay element to Destiny 2 yes it can be frustrating but it's honestly really fun
---
I don‚Äôt have it 
---
I used trust from Gambit drops for this one, but others could work.
---
We all did this months ago. Quit crying 
---
I run chaperone and stomp-EE5
---

---
with trust and a real nice strykers surhand
---
Crooked fang as a heavy
---
And to synergize top tree gunslinger
---
Decked out completely for pvp 
---
Takes a bit of skill to pull off but that's what I'm going for 
---
at Max rng got him 3 exotics, cuz 2 are quest related and xur sold the ahamkara gauntlets. he also could've gotten the robes from xur, so rng had nothing to do with at least half of those 6 exotics. that being said, he was lucky for those exotics that he did get thru rng.
---
Trust is good.tpp.
---
Sorry man it's an exotic quest you shouldnt be surprised by the length
---
Just wait until you get the last word quest or malfeasance or get to the end of Luna‚Äôs howl or literally any other gun quest in the game 
---
Easily offended is just an excuse to insult people with inpunity. Especialy when what he said was in no way meant to mean anything other than how I took it, but like you say. To each his own. I get my lore from myleen gaming and never feel like this guy thinks he is better than me because he has to educate me on some lore.
---
I think when Gambit was first introduced, your power level mattered a little bit for fighting enemies. Now, the enemies are equally brutal for everyone and power level only matters for fighting other players. This was changed quite some time ago, though. 
---
I‚Äôm  sorry I don‚Äôt have money to pay for Black Armory to have access to all the great guns that you guys have 
---
Jotun is awesome for that too if you have it/can get it. 
---
I see. I might just suck at the game lol.
---
Crimson hand cannon is good for that it's what I used
---
I shall alert the Inquisition immediately. Emperor save us
---
I'm currently running mayhem \*laughs in Australian and then melts\* 
---
Trust works so does Annual Skate (legendary Y1)
---
Yep, it's really like I'm playing D1 again with every other person using The Last Word. (And with Thorn coming soon, ohboi.)
---
ohboi
---
No shit it‚Äôs a game 
---
I respect your right to be wrong
---
You need it. Trust me
---
youtubers have said it
---
Yap üòÅ I usually wake up at 6:30am to get to school and I finish school some times at 4pm and others 3pm but i need to do a 1h30 to get to my house and school everyday hahaah 
---
Bro that's literally me when that happens man no one even takes care of the guy and when they do its when he's ten seconds left 
---
Then enlighten me, how have titans always been the favorite?
---
MUMMY!!!!
---
I played some Borderlands 2 and watched some DBZ.
---
A few suggestions,  only my opinion of course. 
---
1. Spell words out,  u is not you. 2 is not to for example. 
---
2. At the beginning,  center the words for easier reading. Didn't look centered on my end. 
---
3. Capitalize words that are SUPPOSED to be. 
---
4. Make that guy cry more and louder! It's funny shit. 
---
IMO this would make the video and this post better, much better! 
---
Otherwise,  great video!
---
I stopped watching dbz, I didn't enjoy the new season 
---
Ublock my guy. Ublock.
---
Did you not even read what I said. I literally praised you in my last post. But here you are breeding toxicity. You dont listen to opinions you read my stuff and others and basicly called everyone stupid because you dont agree with them. Its not a debate when you are just wrong. Good luck with youtube.
---
P.s. I already told you I dont care about cosmetics so why would i even buy silver. And there is nothing in my history if me whining so keep insulting me idc.
---
Pc
---
Gotcha. I'm on Xbox so none of my tips would apply. 
---
Wow! Thank you so much!! 
---
not even that really, Transversise Steps gives it basically infinite Fan Fire. cause running reloads the gun.
---
I dont even think you can call that an opinion. 
---
Your statement is blatantly false, even in the lore the gun is used to kill guardians... 
---
TLW is outclassed by literally all 180 RPM hand cannons in PvE (and beyond) , since it literally has no good PvE perks (such rampage, firefly, explosive rounds, kill clip etc.) AND it you can‚Äôt put mods on it (such as extended mag, firefly or rampage spec etc.).
---
So basically what you have is an 8 round ‚Äú180 RPM‚Äù exotic hand cannon with no range and no good hoard perks in PvE...
---
In PvP, the gun is a monster. Outstanding TTK and great hit registration. 
---
Wow I just got this roll last night but it has a handling master work. Unfortunate but it took me almost 200+ hand cannon frames so I‚Äôm just glad I finally got it. 
---
Nation of Beasts***
---
Because half of the Titans exotics don't need increased ... 
---
BB- it's a one throw same as nova bomb
---
Spectral- it's basically the same as your juggernaut option on a Titan with the vest kills make it last longer 
---
Tether/shadowshot- gives super energy back for a one shot super that suppresses enemy supers and gives a shaddowshot 8 shots that honestly don't do much 
---
Arcstrider - raiden extends the time because without the extended time it takes I believe 3 heavy swings which really isn't much that's not moving either 
---
Also HUNTER SUPERS HAVE THE LOWEST HEALTH...
---
But Titans let's touch this
---
Hammers - one speeds up how fast you can throw them and increases damage the other explodes and one hits most supers...
---
Ward of dawn- okay I'll give you that one it could be better but helm of saint 14
---
Sentinel- there's this thing called Ursa
---
Fists/missle leaves an AEO that kills after impact 
---
Also missle is equivalent to BB or nova bomb 
---
Juggernaut -... It can be kept throughout an entire Gambit round ... I don't have to say anything else
---
Haven't touched that one yet, but sounds good 
---
Different situations sometimes requires different needs. For instance,  no need for 2 or 3 warlocks running well of radiance 99% of the time. You should use what your team needs OR what you're comfortable with for what activity your participating in.
---
I don't understand why anyone would lock onto 1 specific subclass. There is a reason why we have options. üòÅ Good luck guardian! 
---
Yeah I just wanted to keep it up to date
---
As you can see I‚Äôm very low level only played a few days yet I got this weapon tonight, how rare is it and is it worth keeping as it will take me forever to get high enough level to use it. Thanks. 
---
That‚Äôs not grammar, that‚Äôs you lying, you said I was ‚Äúliterally saying oh there‚Äôs no one complaining about this‚Äù. Where did I say that? By avoiding an answer you‚Äôre the one person embarrassing themselves
---
üòÇüòÇ
---
If you are referring to the level requirement then yes it‚Äôs quite normal 
---
Been in the game since D1
---
I'm close. My Warlock is like 645-6 right now. 
---
Mee too lol
---
Hey what can you say man...in a argument everyone always wants the "last word" bdm tss
---
That depends honestlu if you have fan fire x4. U can get pretty good mid range shots with it.
---
Idk about you, but it always feels like the last few light levels just take forever to get
---
I did it with a crimson masterwork it took forever 
---
The three shot one is different, looks more like the Hawkmoon (rip rhabby), but the 6 shot is 100% the last word
---
Oh but I can.
---
Fallen are slippery jerks.
---
Hahahahaha!!! Juke!!!! 
---
Malfeasance is terrible because it gets compared to ‚Äúgod tear‚Äù PvE hand cannons üòÇ
---
Nation of beasts curated roll is Destiny 1‚Äôs fate bringer, and wardens law is the only hand cannon in game that can roll with feeding frenzy. I have one with feeding frenzy and rampage and it has 5000+ kills. Exponentially better than last word by the way. 
---
I used to use the last word all the time during Destiny 1. It helped me go flawless 50+ times. Speaking as a D1 veteran, who used the old D1 ‚Äúbetter version (less recoil) of last word‚Äù I can say that: 
---
it is not good in PvE. 
---
I feel like this is your first exotic, and you going bad shit crazy over it because it‚Äôs better than anything else you have. 
---
Give me your gamer tag so I can see how many hours you‚Äôve played, than I may respect your reality bending ‚Äúopinion‚Äù that myself and oh so many others disagree to.
---
Thank you for the clarification.
---
Hey man some of us need that triumph XD
---
I can‚Äôt really be sad because these are all quests lol
---
Congrats! I did on D1, but haven't gotten there yet on D2. Nice job!
---
Box Breathing is useless in general but since Twilight Oath is a low impact sniper, if you come across a super it‚Äôs nice for that bonus damage if you land your shot
---
got it the day it came out. and i used it for awhile but stopped. 
---
Have fun trying to get close enough to use it while they have Queenbreaker.
---
Send in the Calvary! (Only real real og‚Äôs will remember)
---
Didn't play. Best day. 
---
Not sure I was playing crucible after a game i got it 
---
I'm waiting for Bungie to bless me with this shader already
---
Yeah I‚Äôm not looking forward to the next season being based around gambit I hate gambit enough already 
---
Absolutely stunning, I'm curious as to how long it took you to make such a piece. Usually this kind of artwork can take around 5 hours to a couple days.
---
So I recently just got back into Destiny after a friend gifted me Forsaken. I have a gun that has the gold edges like this one here but I don't know what it means. 
---
I imagine him screaming, "FOR THE CITY"
---
\*titan smash\*
---
I love the chaperone it‚Äôs so satisfying when you get a headshot 
---
I a decent amount of your videos and i think you have some great ideas and i know you dont believe me but i pulled the gray hornet sparrow yesterday and i believe they said the lower drop rate thing in a this week at bungie post. I just think their has to be a distinction between complaining and critiquing. Plus I do think your pay 2 win comment is kind of decieving. I think mictotransaction exclusive items are not good for destiny but if someone wants to buy etched engrams they can do that. I'm not going to but if someone wants to they should be able to. 
---
Also, insulting me by calling me a kid that doesn't know what their talking about is uncalled for when all I did was in response call you a dumbass. Also I dont know what you thought you found on my account was me whining about the game because if you talking about my post me and some guy got into an arguement that we ended up agreeing on anyways. Otherwise you should see that I'm actively trying to help people out on this sub.
---
For some reason though I just can‚Äôt hit anything with that gun. Even with those perks I‚Äôd rather be using a trust or something else. Maybe it‚Äôs the recoil? I can hit the initial shot but then it‚Äôs just whiffs after that. 
---
Don't do it.  I f#$king deleted my trench barrel threat level curated   I don't know I did and now I think I won't get another 
---
I don‚Äôt exactly remember but I‚Äôm pretty sure you get the quest after completing ace of spades. Sorry if that‚Äôs wrong I did the quest a while ago and have forgotten.
---
Seeing this just kindles my orchid. 
---
TLW is really only good for short range, if you don't wanna use a shotgun. I'd Pair it with a sniper or a fusion, or a pulse for range. 
---
This video makes me so sad. This is literally a human mating dance that fails. But my god was it glorious! 
---
Thanks!
---
It's more of a gambit weapon, I have never encountered it in comp
---
Rally to the flag will fill ammo and super, but you lose the super energy when the forge loads up. Ammo stays though
---
All he wanted was a samurai charge, where two warriors leap into the air and one collapses upon landing while the other cut them down. But ofcourse you didn't bring your sword.
---
only roll u can get
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
You should have placed an empowering rift to get that 1hko     /s
---
You‚Äôre right, Didn‚Äôt see that. Weird thing is it was a fresh run. Whatever not the end of the world. 
---
Yes
---
So it was likely a fresh run with a failed first encounter, and then the leader went to orbit. 
---
The rule is : if you can punch it, you can kill it.  
---
This makes xol scary.
---
At first I thought this would be like a joke where you show the pic of the original and then some crappy 2nd grade level artwork......but damn......it looks real..........great job
---
Your mobility will differentiate the height of your jump. Not the transverseive steps.
---
You must be delusional
---
We were both at like 5 mobility 
---
First find a group, that is your best option.  
---
Second 5 and bank. This rule is golden bank what you can when you can dont over commit.  
---
Third watch the enemies more count. If they're getting close to 25/50 turn in what you have even if you have 9 or worse 14 motes just bank them losing them is the worst thing ever.  
---
Fourth keep the bank clear when they start depositing clear the blockers so you can turn in when you need to not getting stuck when the invader comes
---
Also if you scrap a masterwork item you get enhancement core(s)
---
Thats it. Will probably run it again at some time to get the badge on rr. But for now ill just take the triumph score. 
---
Well that just goes for the other fireteam as well. They could be trash
---
I kind of agree with your statement, in the sense that TLW is not overly great in pvp, but it gets the job done, and it performs exactly the same way in pve. Not the best, but effective nonetheless. 
---
I stumbled upon this same mission and got the three tokens solo. Don't ask how long it took or how many deaths. I was wondering why it was so difficult before doing researching. Good on you for asking first, haha. 
---
He doesn't show up on the map but he's there
---
That's the unfortunate thing for me, whenever I max out all three characters I stop playing since there isn't much left to hold my interest until the next update.  That's why this time I haven't been rushing it, but I'll probably be at max next week on the last character.
---
Why my pp hard
---
In all seriousness, as a Chaos Reach main, this makes me feel warm and fuzzy and I totally didn‚Äôt bust the fattest nut ever 
---
Ooo sht thanks man, I read somewhere that he will show up on the map. Will check him out ! 
---
But then I can't get my teammates special ammo when I'm running two guns that use primary. I'll often run that when I see a lot of sniper/shotguns on the team. 
---
Repost it without the typo.
---
Honestly though.
---
He changes location every week as well, from Friday till reset I think
---
I want his dance to be an emote.
---
more like a black engram that drops exotic weapons of sorrow.
---
‚ÄúUldren... get your bullet out of my Cayde‚Äù
---
Short answer. No. It‚Äôs by the highest glory.
---
Longer answer. Other things can affect this. Mainly just players in the region. If you‚Äôre in a region with a very low player count it can eventually match you with players at a much lower glory if there isn‚Äôt anyone close to yours playing.  
---
Sunshot... can‚Äôt go wrong with Sunshot 
---
Oh so I have a couple hours to check him out. He sells those nightfall card thingys too right? 
---
Yeah, the five of swords.
---
Alright will check it out! 
---
Not a god roll. Doesn‚Äôt have heavy guard. 
---
wishender bow quest, you get this mission after you do the shattered throne and interact with the statue after the big ogre fight. once you do this mission you get 3 tokens, go back to the shattered throne kill 3 secret bosses by in each encounter by using ar charges hidden. watch a youtube video. esoterick and ninja pups best guides IMO.
---
Thanks a lot man!! 
---
I'm just saying that I don't agree with Eververse loot being season exclusive.  It isn't fair for those who either missed out, or weren't around, or people like me who simply didn't get certain things.  I never got the selfie emote to drop from Season 2 and there's nothing I can do about it now. I don't understand why it would be a problem to give us quests and bounties that would specifically give us an emote, or ornaments.  Similarly to how the vanguard elite bounties from D1 gave us armor.   That was one of the most opportunistic things I've ever seen Bungie do, and it reminds me of how Masterwork cores drop from Scrapper bounties now.  Turning something into nothing is what those are examples of.  I said in my video that Eververse has some amazing looking armor, specifically the Star Crossed armor set for the Titan.   But what if I want a different roll on the entire armor set?  I'd either have to get it to drop from an etched engram or wait until it's sold because I can't get it through regular means of gameplay.  That's completely unacceptable.  Evervese can stay in the game and not suck, and it's 100% possible.  But now that Bungie and Activision severed ties, I don't see Eververse getting better.  It'll probably be even worse since Bungie will have less ways to monetize D2 now that they'll be self publishing the game.
---
*SPOILERS (kinda)* Oh yeah I just remembered to ask, is Cayde alive yet
---
I rarely actually go for 15 motes, but when I do, you better believe my teamates with 0 motes are hiding from that invader at all cost.
---
The weapon is very rare and I think it is great. The hardest part is to get your hands on the meatball, to get it more often you ''just'' need to farm gambit on the 3rd cycle of The dreaming city, when the corruption is on it's higher level.
---
And the quest is at least time consuming, not that hard on the end. The hardest is still to make the 4 guardians kill while invading, but you don't have to do it yourself, while you'll be grinding for the guardian kills (easy step), you'll probably find a good invader.
---
Your other ideas are great, would love to learn more about the drifter, even if I do not own tje Annual Pass  üòÇ
---
Unless you have queensbreaker. I'm not even that good at invading and got it my second match. 
---
If you really, you keep all ammo except for super 
---
Never had a shotgun with trench barrel? It becomes an habit after a while to melee everything before shooting 
---
He's at the edz at the moment as well, in the winding cove
---
Yes. Kinda grindy. Spend daily/weekly/quest gear wisely.
---
YOLO. I did something like this - with hunter ult -4
---
Or this could be your title, "Well, Guess I'm in charge now"
---
I started binge watching the wire and am currently in season 5 about to wrap it up. I had put destiny 2 down before forsaken came out until about a week ago. When I booted up the game and had Daniels yelling at me in game it was a majorz satisfying wtf moment.
---
You only get two chances per character. It can only drop from a powerful frame i.e. the first time you forge a weapon that week. 
---
I got one of those a few weeks ago. It's amazing but the reload speed sucks. So, I gave it to my hunter so he can dodge/reload.
---
He can still see it
---
Lootcifer will listen when all others ignore you. 
---
it affected his work as he said
---
wow another funny actor doing the voice actor for this game? good job Bungie......  
---
i need to watch this xD
---
Thanks for sharing! I find agree, it is semi easy to get the quest completed after you receive it. Maybe a minor buff could help it out a little bit, make it more useable in crucible compared to something like lunas.
---
Great job mate, I counted 13. Highest I‚Äôve ever gotten is about 15 but that‚Äôs only because of first wave on EP
---
Nah he's still dead
---
caw caw bang fuck i'm dead
---
While a player can ignore pvp, a player cannot ignore pve. Almost every quest has a pve step of some sort. Why people complain about this baffles me. PvP catalysts or quests usually lead to PvP weapons. Nobody is being forced to play PvP. Everyone is forced to play PvE.
---
I didn't shoot from distance because i always feel shot gunning from that sort of range wouldn't be effective on a shielded enemy.. thats why i kept trying to get up close.. also i try to use trench barrel as much as possible to save ammo. 
---
Is this what love feels like?
---
Ir they just wanted to let you down easy
---
The future war cult shader .. im sorry i don't remember the name 
---
Or you can read the lore like he did. 
---
Well you missed out on many missions in the dreaming city, they are still going to happen but just saying that you missed out on a lot and you should propably watch them on youtube, like a quite interesting new guardian getting risen by a ghost
---
I FUCKING DID IT BOYZ, I can't even believe this, I've been trying to get that weapon for so fucking long, but alas I finally got it.
---
IMO the second step was the hardest everything after that was easy
---
Hahahahah.. 
---
&gt;turned into Superman
---
Nah i count 3 forsaken exotics and a black armory exotic
---
Yep would have been nice ... But teammate whacked him 
---
That‚Äôs not blade barrage....
---
Summed it up very well 
---
Ohpe won one, then got placed into a match where it was 70 to 135 (I was on losing team of course). Lost within a minute. Much fun was had.
---
At least you weren‚Äôt getting team stomped in com by 4 lunas then received 2 messaged and constant tea bagging
---
I find lunas way more common.  Id say maybe 1 person in every 12 opponents is using TLW
---
I got air assault and slideshot on blast furnace. on BLAST FURNACE. damn game wants me to slide and jump with a pulse rifle xD
---
If you report the Gamertag he will get Communication Banned. The Xbox Enforcement Team takes Zero tolerance to messages like this and even if it is blanked out.
---
The shotgun is pretty good so I hope the rng gods show mercy to you 
---
Oh yes.
---
r/gifsthatdontstop
---
or grabbing heavy ammo and not going through portal when its open...
---
Yah though you might want to change sight and stuff for better range if you can and if you're on pc. 
---
I miss my Eyasluna....
---
Keeping grinding for the drop mag kill clip rampage 
---
Yes that‚Äôs a realy good roll for pve especially!
---
Bruh sorry to hear, still waiting for a curated threat level to drop for me, no luck yet 
---
I have already done so. Thanks for the suggestion.
---
I would say destiny 2 is a really good game right now compared to pre-forsaken. I would personally recommend it. If you're going to play in PC and would like someone to play with, hit me up.
---
Yikes this meme is gonna get bant
---
Grats! Now time to grind for those titles.
---
How much free time do you have in a daily basis? Do you like PvP or PvE only? In my opinion (and in my experience), if you don't have 2-3 hours daily for gaming with Destiny 2, then don't buy it. There is plenty of  quests, bounties, raids, rare items, etc in the game so you just going to grind grind grind and never going to "finish" it. But if you do like this form of gaming, then go, buy it. I  bought the Annual Pass in last  autumn, when the main game was free, and I still don't know if it worth it, because a lot of grinding. :D
---
I keeo getting fucken triple tap and disruptuon break or watever
---
Only positive thing about all these badges required for titles is that you only need an amor set for one class. Now for those dreaming city cosmetics :///
---
This guy is rapid firing blue pulses and green hand cannon. This is not is main account so I would ask for an ip ban
---
I only ever see armor piece and bad omens drop. Any of the other weapons seem much more rare compared to the others. But that might be just me.
---
I need your help recovering it's data.
---
It's even worse with vex Centurions  ans Jotunn
---
So I can't get for example a Rampage and Surrounded from a normal frame?
---
Faster than lw
---
*Chaos Screech* - the Destiny servers, probably
---
why you holding 15 motherfucker 
---
I believe I used thunderlord if I‚Äôm not mistaken lol 
---
hes a legend. and wish his recovery mentally a great success!
---
I was just about to bank then and got invaded, couldn't run before my ass got sleeped
---
If worst comes to worst and you don‚Äôt get get it someday when I can afford I‚Äôd get it for you. Destiny 2 is my favorite game and I want others to enjoy it as much as possible. (Destiny 2 helped me with depression about a year ago and because I had it it was the only thing keeping me from ‚Äúnumbing the pain‚Äù because Destiny 2 wound up being my numbing agent)
---
Nah, thats just a cabal drop pod. Seems to have hit yet another unsuspecting person. Ouch!
---
Nom, I looked into it and now I understand what a Curated Roll means.
---
This one gets reposted at least once a month here. Wait until next season where gambit gets expanded. Gunna be every other post. 
---
The helmet stayed on
---
Depends who they (and you) were playing against. Maybe they (you) were a bunch of randoms versus a full team. Those really good teams can pull off some incredible stuff like seeing that a player has a lot of motes, invading because of that and preventing you from dropping the motes off by spawning blockers at the exact time you are about to bank.
---
I do agree those numbers are high but they must have had some losses on their side too (it was 3rd game as you say).
---
Anyway what really gets my blood boiling is when the team has enough motes to spawn (everybody gets the message "bank and summon...") and 3 guys bank as soon as possible and then you see the last guy passing by the bank because he is at 13 motes......... (while all you need is another 5 to spawn the boss)....
---
I fell in love with Monochromatic. Nothing fancy but a definite favourite of mine
---
Video unavailable in your country/region üò§
---
Curated rolls don't have selectable perks. Every forge can give curated rolls.
---
Glory rank will reset. If you are at 2100 glory now, i would say you should grind out the steps. If you're pretty far from 2100 might as well wait and not stress it out. Maybe finish up the steps leading to it this season and just push comp without caring about getting steps done next season could also be a good idea.
---
Nice one
---
Milestones! Just play the game normally and you'll get it eventually :)
---
LEROY JENKINS!!!!
---
I wish the gun was better because it definitely could of been. Just not with my exotic slot.  
---
I'm already done with that step; I'm at the defeating guardians step but thanks anyway!
---
Yes!! Make sure you lock that sucker. 
---
When I tried Crimson headshots did like 25 damage which I didnt like. I'd rather get 70 with ace than rely on my ability to land all 3 with crimson for slightly more damage 
---
Nice! I got one with surrounded and rampage and its an absolute monster.
---
No shoot. Only punch 
---
At least you knew what their doing. Sometimes I'm not sure what's going on in team mates heads. 
---
Nah I didn't get a single legendary this weekend and played a lot
---
Snap! I almost got the same roll yesterday but have appended magazine instead of drop mag. I put backup mag on to keep it at 13 but with my Hunter dodge to reload I don't really think I need it. Congrats!
---
I'm glad they buffed the worst PvE super in the game to being at least enjoyable, but I'm sticking with blade barrage/Shards of Galanor.  It's just better in more situations.
---
well played !! 
---
 im personally sick of gambit  after grinding breakneck and Malfeasance   
---
"Ramming an enemy into a wall stuns them for 3 seconds and grants you super energy, Enemies killed by the Ram attack refresh your melee cooldown"
---
This is why we got Beeg Beeg Punch super. For when regular punches just aren‚Äôt enough
---
PRIMEVAL.  IT'S NOT DIABLO FFS.
---
I can tell you now gambit is in a piss poor state because i get matched with spergs all the time. Im not playing a game where my teammates are essentially throwing constantly. I afkd breakneck and i aint sorry, if bungo added mmr to it maybe i would not have 
---
It always stays on
---
Yup PS4 still has the largest population for this game.
---
Okay?
---
No, it's trash compared to luna's, not forgotten or even the ace of spades in PVP. Waste of an exotic slot in PVE. Essential for completionists though.
---
Titan Style
---
Try a sniper rifle and/or thunderloard.
---
I'm from a long forgotten time when it was the Hunter's that were the OP's but Bungie keep fucking shit up so i don't really bother to play anymore haha
---
one time i was playing gambit and my 2 year old was like "daddy i gotta poop", so then i rush him to bathroom then try and get back to the game and im sure it was annoying to my teammates. moral of the story is sometimes parents want to play too
---
Alright, alright, alright. Java on the field. Bring an IDE.
---
I dont... what?
---
Threat level is real good aswell!
---
Think I stuffed up... I'm at the step where you have to get 100% crucible kills..
---
Well I for one welcome our new Warlock overlords.
---
This thing is absolutely absurd since the recent golden gun buff. The display damage caps out at 999,999 on most targets. It's actually doing more.
---
I melting pointed him the other day. There's a short window where the shoulder charge will still connect
---
At least Xur is relevant lol 
---
Depends on who more is.

The queen is probs dom

I think all of the exotics that require any PvP steps are exotics that are almost exclusively used in PvP outside of just joking around. I would understand if a premier PvE gun like whisper was tied to PvP, that would be a fair gripe. But I think it‚Äôs not only fair but it makes sense to reward PvP play with PvP exotics. If you want to be a completionist then that by definition kind of means that you will have to play every mode. Imagine how annoying it would be for a PvP player if a gun like not forgotten was obtained by doing loads of hardcore PvE stuff ?
---
Literally 
---
I'd imagine the requirement is less the number and more "Bring a character you at least look like you can play properly"
---
How many hand cannons do we need anyway?
---
Based on how completions are counted I‚Äôd say yes 
---
Oooooooo even better!!
---
*cringe*
---
Die
---
1. This one to be specific. 
---
Also yes we do need more exotics in every category period. 
---
Probably will have to do it on another character i assume? 
---
I mean, I guess it's a good way to get your point across
---
Is there even a hunter vanguard anymore?
---
I've made no such advances. I know how stereotypical it sounds, but I was trying to do a nod to the LGTBQ fanbase than talking about picking up girls on the internet. 
---
Not with boss battles. Especially whisper. The damage is insane. I had to put down WoR and my normal rift to when try to stay alive
---
Imagine a character like the hound in Destiny üëå
---
The other two are much easier once you have one toon at 650. Just sayin. 
---
I was struggling with the pvp part too, what I found made things easier for me at least was to play competitive. Use an Auto Rifle and run with your other teams mates and get assisted kills. 
---
I went from struggling to maintain 3 kills without dying in quickplay to kill streaks in competitive. I dunno, maybe it‚Äôll help. 
---
Honestly, saying you wouldn't date a hunter is more believable. :P
---
Petra is better, change my mind.
---
Thank you! They're my favorite part üòÅ
---
These are too fucking good...
---
Thank you! 
---
Invading ASAP isn't actually all that bad. In my eyes, killing the enemy team before they have a chance to kill envoys and gain slayer stacks is invaluable. After that its probable to assume their envoys are dead and its a dice roll of whether they burn their primeval or wittle it away. No wrong or right answers to invasions at the primeval stage. So long as you get kills in the process.
---
You can buy Drang from someone. I don't remember, it's either the planetary vendor or maybe the cryptarch on the farm.
---
Wait till you get the ornament
---
Thanks! Me too üòä
---
yea my lock is 605 titan is 595  just  cant grind it all again lol . not right now  anyways im sure  i will in time 
---
I think they were saying when to shoot the micro missiles from the tanks at I guess the most efficient times, personally I don't do it since you'll complete the phase easily just going ham on the middle even with perfect damage phases.
---
and as far as I know synced attacks don't deal bonus damage.
---
Its there
---
Synchronizing the lock on missiles deals massive damage for a reason I'm unsure about.
---
EDZ is a zone where German was spoken, or atleast written. Enjoy your epiphany.
---
You're only considering Reddit users at this point, many players across all platforms who play Crucible want this nerfed as well, countless threads, through multiple websites (not just reddit) have been made arguing against the exotic. It's not hard to see that no exotic comes close to the OEM in the crucible. 
---
If you find someone AFKing in a Strike, convince the other guy to leave. They'll come back 12 hours later to find themselves sitting in the same strike. :D
---
RIP Cayde-6
---
Spicy. 
---
hawkmoon is returning in penumbra
---
What I like is the excuse that since scout rifles have such good range the damage will always be lower than other weapon types. Guess nobody has ever tried pulse rifles...1 scout shot is as much as 1 bullet in a 3 or 4 round pulse shot....
---
Probably won‚Äôt till the next large expansion 
---
Me too o used it in trials and me and by buddy did a stack up if he missed the snipe I finished them off
---
Nope thats the point of the post, i can not make it again
---
Oh I know I was just being specific to Reddit
---
The last wish shader looks excellent on pretty much anything.
---
The tip is kill enemy with motes for carry the game. The other team do it fine.
---
Yeouch, Tbf year1 was a complete disappointment and I actually stopped playing January last year and i didn't start playing again until October when a friend recommended i try out the Forsaken DLC as apparently it really saved the games ass.  I used to be a raid specialist but when i came back there's now like 3/4 new raids that i gotta learn haha
---
Tyra karn, crypto on Farm?
---
It makes me so sad that bungie seems to have completely forgotten about the last words sister that had so much more of a fun and more thought based playstyle to it. Also its god damn beautiful 
---
thanks ill check it out
---
I deleted a 740 hour hunter just to see my god once again.
---
Nah man, guided games no mic is the way to go
---
NO FUCKING WAY
---
But not one worth taking off your helmet for
---
WHAT! I assumed it all went away because of the super leaving, I never actually looked. 
---
Thanks OP!! 
---
I have a targeting adjuster on mine with the same roll. Mostly because I have still not got a rampage mod, but I have like 7 sprint grips. 
---
Fuck the Queen a "look at me I'm misterous"
---
Works well in Mayhem too, GG is not going to get all its shots off and many roaming supers can take more than 1 hit from a normal shot.
---
This makes it so a hit will 100% kill anyone give you 33% back and just feels good.
---
Ill trade the extra 2 shots from bottom tree for 1 shot that 100% kills another player.
---
Loving my Tango-45 XK5094.  
---
Triple Tap, Rampage.
---
Slays...
---
Most of the replies here aren‚Äôt great. If you buy a hand cannon frame from ada, it has a chance to drop any perk that the weapon can get. The curated roll for this gun is not exclusive, so you can get a non masterworked version of the gun with those perks. Kill clip rampage, outlaw rampage, and surrounded rampage are all very good rolls. If you get a kill clip rampage or a surrounded rampage, youre gonna want good reload perks for the magazine. Things like drop mag, flared magwell, or light mag, or even tactical mag, and using a piece of arm armor with a hand cannon loader, light arms loader, or enhanced hand cannon loader perk.
---
Got dropped into Bergusia alone about 6 times yesterday. You‚Äôre definitely not alone 
---
I love skyburners oath. The hip fire homing shots are very useful in gambit!
---
Transfiguration.  It‚Äôs amazing with Full Auto &amp; Dragonfly 
---
It looked like they were rubber banding to me which would cause something like that to happen. Have you considered getting an Ethernet cable?
---
This actually common. Still hilariously genius for a simple AI to do it.
---
I have thought of it 
---
Forsaken is basically essential. It improves the game drastically and adds a lot of much needed endgame content. I'd recommend buying the annual pass at some point, but you can get by for a month or two without it easily.
---
Anyone got some good queen mara sauce
---
Go commit die
---
Yeah, you need to dismantle some of the raid gear that drops with it.
---
Come on Bluejay almost had it too.
---
Dang haha very awesome! My first and only drop was Kill Clip and Rampage with a reload MW. I figured fine, look I could grind forever in hopes of getting that + Drop Mag but no use being greedy. I was greedy on my Blast Furnace though, again first drop ever was Rampage and Outlaw, but handling MW. Meh. I tried a bit this week and on my 6th try I got one I consider better for me personally - Zen Moment, Rampage, Drop Mag, and range MW. For crucible I just don‚Äôt always even try to kill with headshots. I see someone weak I aim for the body and finish them, but this Drop Mag combined with Ophidian Aspect, it‚Äôs blink and you missed it fast reload. I can‚Äôt get over just how fast it is and the range is nearly max. 
---
While it will not help RNG, you can farm the nodes faster.  Save up your stems.  Fillup your consumables (most of us have stacks of gunsmith materials and baryon boughs in our vaults).  Make sure your post master is empty.  Now, you can start making codes.  Since your consumables are full, the codes will go to the post office and allow you to make as many as your post office will hold.  You can then pick up (either at the tower/farm or though and app like DIM) all of the ones you made for a specific area at one time and go open them.  You always end up with dupes here also, so only pick up one for each node in an area at a time.  I use DIM and just pull them in indvidually.
---
Also if you have not opened all 40 nodes (D2checklist will tell you which you need) you should move around to different areas to make nodes, where you are standing will affect where the node code is for.
---
What's your build in this video? I was too baffled to actually pay close attention lol 
---
Jaren
---
or 
---
Shin
---
Oxa
---
Yeah you gotta watch the cracks they'll break YOUR back. 
---
WTF is SCP-173 and why do we care?
---
I got the curated Last Wish scout rifle and I like it. Good in pve anyway
---
How about sunshot then?
---
Yup, took me over 50 NFs to get Osprey. Winter wolf took me several weeks of 1 schematic a day. Keep it up and good luck.
---
Hell no, they are finally fun!
---
Maybe all the other archetypes, but 150s are in such a good place now. Single rampage stacks and they one shot just small mobs (Acolytes, Vandals etc) reliably. I have a Kill clip Rampage Transfiguration and I'm loving it. Way using it a bunch doing Xol's nightfall last night. It was doing solid work even with a 99 light debuff on a high point run.
---
And don't get me started on PvP. In Gambit, 150s are the weapons you should be using. They have so much range, and three tap any Guardian without any stacks, easily two tapping with rampage/kill clip. Actual crucible it's just a matter of finding a long range spot on the map, to actually make use of the range advantage. 
---
Aztecross recently put up a video on the scout buffs, so you can see all the archetype damage changes, and Time To Kill values for each of them
---
Just bottom tree striker. Nothing else. Killing enemies with your melee attack adds super energy back so if you kill enemies fast enough your super continues. There‚Äôs a video on YouTube of someone using one super to kill all the adds in the whisper mission from the first room to the boss encounter. Actually insane 
---
I've only ever gotten 2
---
Your mum? /s
---
Make sure you're trying to recollect Drang on a character who has done the quest. 
---
Oh fuck off. 
---
If you have a handcannon frame in your inventory when the week resets and then you complete it in the new week that frame will be available from Ada all week. They only let you do two frames a week so if one of them was from the week before it sticks around.
---
Which is why they should allow us to add our own perks to the gear.
---
Make the grind all about obtaining perks from the Gunsmith and other Vendors.
---
Shaxx would off perks that benefit most in PVP settings. The Vanguard would offer varying perks that benefit PVE.
---
Then make mods become random RnG drops, so that you are enticed further to grind for that awesome mod drop, to make your gear have a bit more umpff  to it. 
---
You guys really should subscribe to a Destiny news channel. Houndish is the only reason I knew to keep ahold of the rare bounty. 
---
Yup. I postponed my matches until about six months after I started. That was bad enough. Can't imagine now.
---
I have respect for your efforts, but also sad because I have now seen a gambit guardian kill count higher than 40(my personal highest). Godspeed
---
Thank you sir
---
You mean that isn't Thomas the Tank Engine?
---
I got it just before christmas and i still have a ton of stuff i haven‚Äôt done. You won‚Äôt get bored for a long while.
---
Its cause you play hunter. Easy class, easy win. Just spam that blade barrage.
---
jesus.. not even Skullfort and it's that beastly? *cries in light*
---
Is that thing even working? 
---
Haha right?! It‚Äôs fucking nuts and I didn‚Äôt even optimize it. I had a gambit match later with some friends where I cleared two waves of adds by myself. My friends just grabbed motes. It was crazy 
---
For real tho. We want Sparrow Racing again.
---
I remember reading that the super drain while invisible was faster. I‚Äôll try to find it.
---
Basically the best kit is either any Warp/Bomb or Dawnblade in PvP. Warp isn't totally useless albeit nerfed, but I find the kit generally very fit for PvP with Handheld Supernova. Overall Warlocks have the highest skill gap in PvP, but very effective in PvE etc.
---
Is that Trump's wig?
---
It is an interesting weapon to be considered exotic. I would consider it like Jade Rabbit. It's perk isn't super unique, but it just provides a lot of bonus stats that make the weapon more powerful. 
---
Maybe bring it back as a purple, pinnacle weapon? 
---
Awesome, best iv every gotten was a 6 streak. Kudos to you guardian lol
---
I'm confused. What do you do to fix this?
---
And that‚Äôs really the thing, Destiny really needs to find a way to balance separately for PvE &amp; PvP, or they‚Äôll never compete with the power fantasy of any other game. They had a step in the right direction with what they did to Telesto and Wavesplitter, they did exactly that, but they‚Äôd have to basically do it from the ground up if they want to change subclasses separately I think.
---
But then, part of the reason people like Destiny‚Äôs power fantasy specifically, is (I think) that it‚Äôs a strong power fantasy that‚Äôs also strongly rooted in reality. Sure, space magic, we have jetpacks and triple jumps, but we still die if we fall. The space magic is still grenades, still barricades, for the most part it‚Äôs still things that function the same way modern things do.
---
Honestly, I feel like all that really needs changing is a pretty fat OEM nerf then a slight reduction on the whole Trample Striker duration. Can't speak for PC with Titan Skating but on console, I feel like they're in a pretty good spot
---
I want Eknaar's (from the Draw) handcannon as an exotic handcannon.
---
Sure :D I dont even want to imagine how sweaty it will be
---
I've been killed by the shield throw after it bounced from TWO walls. 
---
Brave? Or foolish?
---
Slova is killing through walls now. It's pretty much the best super in PvP if you have good timing.
---
&gt; The two things wrong with eu servers dont really matter that just means his wifi is shit
---
What? Who plays on wifi, and even if your internet connection is great, latency to the states and back is at least 100ms, minimum. 
---
I also saw a warlock pop a nova over a wall in crucible and get a  double or triple kill seeing none of the other guardians yet that still makes sense
---
Today I learned of a rabbit hole both morbid and curious.
---
And there went an hour of my timecard.
---
7 nighfalls?
---
Yeah is normal
---
I got the No Feelings to drop curated, cake with short zoom scope, appended mag, full auto, zen moment and handling masterwork.
---
It‚Äôs, just ok, so far. üòï
---
I sweat the soundtrack at phase 3 of vault gets so intense with the damn trumpets. 
---
Boba fett
---
It‚Äôs actually a hairy worm
---
Yeah, its tough - I was doing Riven a bit, but once I got thousand voices there wasn't much reason.  Pretty much the only left once I max will be to get good rolls on a few things, but that's it I think.
---
He wasn't good enough for her
---
Oh I see a man of culture as well 
---
Fist of havoc*
---
It is a good question as to why that is. On PC at least, I think Titans are just better because of how good their skate is and OEM. Maybe most people behave dictated on their tastes rather than what's good, outside of higher tier play? 
---
Always was
---
what was that first gun? and damn thats a lot of damage with whisper
---
If this is true I'm happy..
---
Same here on 3 characters, never seen the ghost sparrow ir ship...couldve had the title like 2 months ago now 
---
I had a guy on my team the other night bank 11 and lose 42. The next game, he was on the other team and banked 48 and didn't lose a single one. Needless to say, I lost both games.
---
well yes and no.  He said that who ever kills him takes his place as hunter vanguard. So Uldren is the hunter vanguard but im not sure if Ikora will be okay with that
---
It's not a "good" exotic, it's a "there's no reason to use ANYTHING else in Crucible" exotic, which means it needs the nerf ASAP. 
---
Interesting... This was my first time coming across that, there goes the all hype :|
---
It‚Äôs ridiculous 
---
Here‚Äôs my Hunter‚Äôs ‚ÄúMemory of Cayde‚Äù setup:
---
- QoH ship
---
- The Gamblers Palm Sparrow
---
- Ace of Spades Emblem
---
- Ace of Spades (Gun)
---
- Full Vanguard Dare armor (got heavy lifting + 2 LMG reserves ;))
---
- Poulty Petting (top emote)
---
- Odd Dance (bottom emote) (‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Cayde‚Äôs favorite.‚Äù)
---
The warlock bit is weird but hunters I understand seeong theyre really gimped in pvp.
---
it depends on the exotics you have. I main a hunter and switch between my shards doing blade barrage or use spectral blades using gwisin vest. just depends on the activity im doing and the fire team im with. but def all the supers are worth it
---
I dont think they suck anymore. They just aren't as good as pulses or hand cannons still.
---
This is Jaren Ward. He mentored shin and when he was killed by Dredgen Yor, Yor sent his ghost and The Last Word back to Shin to assume the mantle and come for revenge.
---
Buff the match making algorithm. 
---
Omg! That is creepy and cool!
---
Where do you get these weekly update pages?
---
Over the weekend I was doing a ton of Vanguard strikes to complete my Merciless catalyst and complete the Loaded Question quest at the same time (since I never use fusion rifles figured knock two birds out with one stone). I joined a guy doing Prison of Elders, afk using a macro to prevent booting. Problem is he was after one of the grav-lift things and hadn't advanced far enough to trigger the Joining Allies teleport, yet *was* far enough that it deactivated the grav-lift making it impossible for anyone who joined him to actually move forward in the strike and complete it, afk or not. So he's just there, ruining matchmaking, not even getting anything done.
---
Some say he's still there.
---
Then pvp will completely die.
---
People already whine about mayhem what do you think will happen if you make it worse.
---
Wait location affects which node you get? It doesn't feel that at. I've usually just sat at the Glacial Basin span point and I've gotten nodes all the way in Alton dynamo. 
---
Do you have T.P?
---
Warlock main, mostly PvE player here. I can tell you that Warlock is uber strong in PvE now. Like better than Titan and Hunter.
---
Chaos Reach with Crown is fantastic for almost ANY PvE situation - super fast ability cooldown (if you manage Conduction Tines well), high-damage super that works well for both add-clear and boss damage (I swap to Geomag before certain boss fights, it can almost one-phase some), having a get-away ability like Pulsewave can save your butt often, Ball-Lightning is actually amazing because it has the range of a hand cannon but it flies straight and has a blast radius. Whoever told you Chaos Reach has a bad kit was either talking *strictly* Crucible, or doesn't like Warlock. Chaos Reach is tied for best subclass for Gambit and general PvE play. I can see why it could be underwhelming without Crown of Tempests, but then every Warlock subclass sucks without one of the Exotic Helmets - it's like that for all the classes. Also, as a Chaos Reach main, lemme tell you a trick: wait and carefully throw your grenade when you know it will get exactly 3 kills, wait for Conduction Tines to reach 1 on the timer, then get 1 kill with Ball Lightning. This extends Conduction enough to give you your grenade and 1/3 your melee back within 10 seconds. Rinse and repeat for amazing add-clear with no weapons.
---
Well of Radiance is, like you said, a more supporrive role. However, with Lunafaction + Thunder/Loaded, or just Whisper, you can deal a lot of boss damage solo. That said it's more difficult to do so than simply pressing the Super button, which is what Chaos Reach does. WoR is best suited when you have a full fireteam, or if you only have 2 and the other person is running a high damage super. The subclass itself is entirely support, so unless you run Verity's Brow and an energy primary, you can't do much of anything with the abilities. However, if you equip Starfire Protocol, Fusion Grenade, and Empowering Rift you can become an overshield/healing dispenser for your teammates which I think is the best way to play WoR.
---
Remember when I said Chaos was tied for best PvE subclass? Guess what it's tied with? Attunement of Chaos Voidwalker, also called Slowva Bomb. This has been THE best Warlock PvE subclass since forever and it finally has a competitor. There are 2 things that make Chaoswalker insane: the Slowva Bomb with Skull of Dire Ahamkara, and the supercharged grenade with either Verity's or Nezarec's Sin (Nezarec requires a Void Primary weapon though). Holding the grenade key down charges it, and releasing throws a grenade that deals more damage, lasts longer, and has a bigger radius. On top of that, enemies killed by any ability explode, so even enemies 2 feet outside the grenade will be killed or weakened. Hitting (not specifically killing) with the melee ability recharges half your grenade energy. Combine that with either aforementioned Exotic helmet and you can throw charge grenades  every few seconds. As you can imagine this is insane for add-clear, shutting down lines of Thrall or closing choke points of incoming Dregs. The grenade deals enough damage to deal with most yellow bars (Majors) and any shield. Then, just by clicking once in the inventory, you can use the Nova Bomb on at least 5 enemies to get your ENTIRE super back thanks to Skull. You can also take a semi-supportive role by equipping Tractor Cannon, which is great for teammates, but even better for you because you can Tractor + Nova and deal substantial damage to basically any boss - even Level 7 EP bosses. As I said before these strats involving Chaoswalker are insane for Gambit.
---
Crucible is a different beast though. With Nova Warp now being useless, Warlock only has 1 good subclass - bottom tree Dawnblade (Attunement of Flame). The super lasts forever so long as you keep getting kills, and with Burst Glide you can move around faster than a 160 Sparrow during the super. The subclass itself isn't great though, the melee ability does explode and have damage over time, and you can use Phoenix Dive to start your health regen, but that's pretty much it. It's underwhelming for PvE and Gambit too, even though the super lasts forever it doesn't do much single-target damage and using it against yellow bars that take 2 shots kills the duration. That and the lack of grenade recharge or a useful melee makes it meh. 
---
I feel like Ticklefingers (aka Stormcaller that isn't Chaos Reach) is worth mentioning. On close range maps like Convergence or Javelin-4, it can be better than Dawnblade. Either tree can be used in Crucible, but I prefer bottom for the Landfall perk that is a 1-shot in a radius around you upon casting, as well as the Arc Soul from rifts. Outside of close range maps, using it is an exercise in frustration. It can be somewhat useful in PvE and Gambit, it's actually great for killing Primeval Envoys and huge areas of adds like Gambit waves, Nokris, Ace in the Hole, etc. However, the aforementioned subclasses do that more effectively without using a super ability, so it's still not worth using. 
---
So yeah, Warlock is weakest in Crucible, but strongest in Gambit and PvE.
---
Last week. Sorry. 
---
The biggest issue would be getting them to lvl 50.  You can use your boost on one (if they are below lvl 30) for an instant boost to 30 with everything through Warmind done.  Fireteam medallion while doing Forsaken will get you to 50 before you finish it.  Fireteam medallion doing the story missions on the other will do the same for it.
---
If you have the horror story and Thunderlord they are equippable at lvl 20, So your light jumps up there quick with those.  You can then purchase blues from your collections to get light quicker if you want, but you don't really need to.  If you do purchase, start with your lowest gear piece, and rotate based on light until you max out.  With the higher light the story missions are super quick and easy cause you can speed run without dying as quick.  
---
Once you hit lvl 50 all of your 650 weapons will come over, then you can purchase again in rotation and get up to 630 with no more grinding.  After that a little lucky RNG, and you hve 3 lvl 650 characters that are ready for the next DLC.  
---
However, if you are never gonna wanna play on them.  Then it may not be worth your time.  (It took me about 6 hrs total to complete osiris &amp; warmind on my titan after I deleted and started over.)
---
Its not all that useful id do it for the shader 
---
FUCKKKK ok
---
Lazy
---
My savior 
---
Benedict has it, as it has not been competed
---
Lol no. This sub is straight cancer when it comes to balance discussion. A bunch of cry babies here still get bodied by shoulder charge. Most of the people that post here probably can‚Äôt even pull a 1.0 average per game. 
---
Would recommend you check out r/Fireteams there are usually a couple clan recruitments around.
---
The one that goes on cooldown after a kill and gets countered by shotguns, fusions, and now the last word that only the shittiest of PvP players get killed by while good players just use it as a directional movement ability?  That melee?
---
That iteration of striker is only good in PvE. 
---
Wait til he's selling simulation seeds. Spend all your shards. Go to Brother Vance. Give him all your thousands of seeds. Dismantle everything including shaders. Get loads of cores + mod components + 80% of your shards back. 
---
600 shards would probably net you 10-12 cores. 7 or 8 mod components and leave you with 500 shards to go again. :)
---
I've done like 20 AR frames for it though.
---
Yeah I think the duration and health chunks were the only real warp issues 
---
I really like the gun, slap a dragonfly mod on it and it's super fun. I wouldn't shard it personally, wait for another curated gun.
---
My one friend died right when xol landed on him so it looked like he died from being squashed by xol's fat worm body
---
Oh I know, I even made a shitty post about doing just that like a few days ago. This just came from me doing it while playing with friends, as they screamed at me that I was an idiot c:
---
Darnnnnn.. got the kill clip version on my second frame. Been chasing this roll since......
---
Headseeker on my masterworked Go Figure with a recoil mod works really well, at least in PvE. The mod gives a straight vertical path, so you aim at their chest and pull, last shot is as you say pretty much every time. 
---
Knowing more about perks now I might not have MWed that one but it turned out to be pretty effective. 
---
Shattered Throne is only available on the third week of the curse. [Here is an album of screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/U3CvlXm) comparing the first and third weeks. If you don't want to physically travel there, look at where Petra is. 
---
The Strand: First, least cursed week
---
Divalian Mists: Second, middle week
---
Rheasilvia: Third, most cursed week.
---
I used to, but man do I love Top tree Nigh stalker with orphrus rigs. I'll just make it easier for the others with my to do the hard work,clearing groups and getting doing damage. 
---
Dragonfly and Rampage is definitely better than Dragonfly and Disruption Break. 
---
you're a legend thank you i was so confused
---
I can understand that and thats a pretty good fix for it I think
---
how do you expect Bungie to keep you playing if they don't tie things up behind RNG?
---
in my more suspicious moments, I suspect that there is an RNG modifier tied to time played on character. 
---
*nobody cares*
---
My sincerest apologies to all the poor guardians out there that I blade barraged in mayhem with shards of galanor for the crucible steps. I hate myself just as much as they do lol.
---
Definitely foolish.
---
Hol up
---
Mara Sov looks like she‚Äôd be too boney. All knees and elbows. 
---
BS... I love shutting down Ace/luna/NF with it
---
Quite hard when it‚Äôs rotating it, but yeah otherwise
---
Is the malfeasance considered a good gun in either PvP or PvE? I heard it gets outperformed in both areas by not forgotten. I also heard that it's lacking in Gambit which makes me really sad to hear because I really like the way it looks and feels. 
---
The problem with the bounties is that they offer such an insignificant infamy gain. ...especially compared to the modifier off of a win steak.  I can't help but feel like you're going to make better progress towards your reset by playing to win and ignoring the bounties.
---
'Course if youre running a shotgun, OEM for void or solar shoulders, or skullfort for the arc, you can ape around the map and not worry. They see you? Slide shotty. No? Bash their head in. Pair it all with skating and youre in for a real treat.
---
Mine came with rampage, kill clip, and drop mag or alloy mag.

I think Petra prefers the queen. 
---
That is true, taking the time to melee causes you to lose DPS compared to just using the full-auto weapon, but you're A) Dealing more damage overall and B) Dealing more efficient damage per ammo, which might not always matter but is a factor to consider. Overall, there's very little places in the game where I need to have the higher DPS and lower ammo-efficiency of non-stop shooting, although it's definitely something to keep in mind.
---
I would argue that most pulse rifles can outrange scouts. I have a go figure with masterwork range and have been able to out snipe sniper users before. Maybe pulse rifles just need a nerf so scouts can shine, or maybe scouts just need much higher damage than they‚Äôre currently doing.
---
happy cake day Guardian!
---
I have tried that two or three times but no luck:(
---
Unfortunately crucible sucks right now imo.
---
1 hit shotguns around corners and 1 hit titan shoulders running around.
---
MY best advice is run something long range like Mida multi and stay at long range to reduce changes of death. 
---
Value your life above the kill and you'll get there eventually.
---
Bring a short range weapon as a backup. Mida smg would be my choice if you have the counter part
---
Congrats! I love the thing, it's been by favorite Forsaken exotic they've added so far, and the questline was pretty fun. The special strike was suuuper cool too!
---
I check recently and they just took my bow frame. Sniper frame is gone from the shop too. it was also bugged. 
---
My bad, but i'll try to make a photo next time to CONTRIBUTE to this subreddit
---
now I'm sad i've grinded to try and get this so much now i just wanna die
---
Awesome thanks I just wanted confirmation that it was guaranteedüëç
---
Bro calm down maybe he just got the game
---
It seems today is your lucky day.  Strainger Terrain is a NF this week.  It only took me about 3 runs to get mine last time it was a nightfall selection.  Use a fireteam medallion, we did a base run to get the nightfall engram, a score run to get the 100K score, then on the third trip through I got it.  May yours be just as quick.
---
How many futures do we win in?
---
This is what I like to see. A post about an achievement without including ‚Äúprobably no one cares‚Äù in the title. Good job.
---
Congrats on the three max levels, now time for triumphs! :D
---
Go into your seal. Preview on the badge triumph. Does it say it‚Äôs completed?
---
I've been waiting for a few days now but it just says the same thing, Just decided to completely unistall the game and move it over to my SSD. 
---
Presumably just 1.
---
I feel it depends on the wielder. I love this this, I feel it fires smoothly and it's actually pretty good for single target damage. It rocks in the forges. However, it does get outperformed. But I would use this over Luna's any day
---
I honestly would settle for pulling random rolls out of collections, like a little mystery box but you can do it whenever you want
---
Agreed! Even though that mote part was fucking chaos due to the Queenbreakers being around every corner
---
Lol yeah I did the same thing 
---
Reacquire old gear my dude one at a time. equip it and get another piece to replace your lowest. i got from 500 to 600 on my alts with recycling collection parts.
---
Standby for Titanfall
---
It's pretty good in PvE and especially Gambit. Three explosion part of it is pretty handy for Knights, and other big/shielded things you don't want to put special into. It holds it's own when used as a special weapon alternative.
---
For Gambit, it's pretty strong with the bonus damage. With it being a 3 tap on any invader, it does really well for weakening the invader if they are nearby. Maybe you won't survive, but you slowed them down, or got your teammates the kill. The explosion is really handy for killing roaming supers as well.
---
But if you have Not Forgotten, you'll probably be using it over anything else, but that's because it's a pinnacle weapon designed for PvP first.
---
Yes its toon, sucks to suck but its a toon, always has been in MMO's sorry you can't accept it.
---
These guys don‚Äôt have a traditional head critspot, I think? That‚Äôs why we shoot the lantern/morning star thing.
---
He's only here Friday - Monday. I use wherethefuckisxur.com it tells you where he is, what hes selling, and a few other things.
---
Good point, plus less stress
---
my favorite piece is the crota and oryx one.
---
Same thing, except curated has drop mag which is better. 
---
[deleted]
---
I don't think so.  I'd rather do a quest that will guarantee the weapon (as long as I put in the effort for it) than rely on RNG.  Even if it takes a little bit of time, if I need help I ask for it.    
---
Yeah 2 days ago before any reset just after getting the quest I went all across the game trying to get compound ether to drop after multi kills precision multi kills super kills shit letting them die of old age if it was an option I came to the conclusion something was fishy with compound ether not dropping. I logged out to ask the great google oracle what was up to find out that indeed there was a bug and a large portion of the community were experiencing the same problem plus disappeared quest frames, I thought to myself well at least my quest frame is there and checked on the companion app to look at my inventory and alas my frame was gone 
---
Hey I know I‚Äôm super late, I‚Äôm super glad to see so many of you enjoying the video!
---
 It really reminds me that d1 was more than just a game, it was an important part of many of our lives. Hope I was able to give you guys a good nostalgia trip :)
---
1) There is an in game team chat channel, but otherwise you would need to create an outside chat (PS4 Chat, Xbox Party Chat, or Discord) that you could invite others into to talk. If you have not joined a clan I would suggest you do so.  It is a great way to make new friends and have chat buddies, even if you are working on different things.
---
2) Levianan, Eater of Worlds, and Spire of Stars all drop gear that is capped at 400 light, so for lvling, if you are past that point, it is not worth it.  However, there are good things that come from those raids. You must complete the leviathan several times to complete the Legend of Acrius quest (exotic shotgun).  The prestige version of each offers a catalyst for different exotics. (Pres Lev=Acrius, Prest EOW= Telesto, Prest SOS= Sleeper).  You will need a fireteam of 6 to do any raid.  You can LFG to get the extras, you could even put that you are looking for a guide and someone may be willing to help.  If you have never done these before plan for a few hours on each one, with a good sherpa.
---
3) It does not sound like your are at endgame yet.  You need to complete the story missions (they are better if done in order, Osiris, Warmind, Forsaken).  Get the Dreaming City unlocked.  Once you have done that it is a matter of grinding light and god roll gear.  Best options are to do all milestones and powerful gear actvities each week.  If you have not created your alt characters, you should do that also.  (I don't touch the wanted bounties, unless I need cores.)
---
4) Gear drops are based on your max light.  Max light is the highest light lvl you can get to if you equip all of your highest equippable gear at one time.  You do not have to have the items equipped, or even on your character for them to count as "equippable".  They need to be either on your character or in the vault, though, not on another character.  Keep in mind that it is highest equippable.  If you have an exotic helmet that is your highest helment, and exotic gloves that are your highest arms, you can only equip one of them at a time.  Soft cap for light is usually about 50 below max light.  If you have not reached soft cap, all of your regular drops will drop at max light and power/prime engrams will drop at 3-5 above light.  Once you reach soft cap, that changes.  Your regular drops will be about 20 below max light (the same that you can buy items from collections at), power engrams from basic stuff drop at 2-3 light above, power engrams from Y2 stuff (Spider gold bounty, Dreaming City stuff, Black Armory Stuff, Last Wish Raid, Scourge of the Past Raid) and prime engrams drop at 3-5 light above.
---
You can only buy gear for shards from collecitons (after soft cap these are 20 below light, and you cannot repurchase anything with random rolls on it, so not a good idea, unless you are infusing a masterwored identical (except for perks) item up using it) or from Xur.  You should buy every Y1 exotic you can from Xur until your collection is complete.  The engram Xur sells is guaranteed to give you one exotic Y1 item you do not have in collections (keep in mind warlock items can only drop for warlocks, etc. so make sure you buy it on the right character if you need armor).  All vendor engrams, other than Xur, are all considered regular drops and will drop accordingly for light levels.  Xur drops as a max of 340 light (I think, I don't usually go see him, cause my Y1 collection was complete ages ago).
---
Draw the scene where King space rhino kicks us off the ledge.
---
Is that a Samsung cf591 monitor
---
Malfeasance was def harder, not to mention how it's RNG based
---
They still have heads 
---
Yeah you need drop mag for kill clip and rampage stacking
---
Depends, if you're a compulsive reloader anything is better then drop and accurized isn't bad at all on a 140, puts it in a higher damage DFA range with one kill
---
I tried this once and got jack squat
---
Them titans are growing fat and having strokes now
---
Think they mean that the shield auto tracks off wall bounces. It's like if you throw it and get the hit without the wall bounce its just added bonus to when the shield hits the wall and auto tracks after that anyone nearby. Only thing I see they need to OEM adjust is  how long having someone marked last
---
Needs a faster reload imo, but amazing roll nonetheless
---
I got it, and can't for the life of me see where I got 5 resets.  Definitely didn't happen in S4 or 5....
---
Finished the bounty party of the quest, and them it gave me the redrix.  Possible I got it in S1, but I don't have the triumph completed, so idk?
---
This is actually hilarious that you think anyone would use peacekeepers.
---
‚ÄúPeople don‚Äôt use anything else because of handcannons‚Äù I‚Äôve heard people say that hunters are the fastest class. I‚Äôve heard people say the trinity ghoul needs a nerf, but that is the dumbest thing I‚Äôve ever heard.
---
I love how you say the auto rifle is a bad example over side arms. It really puts into perspective how out of touch you are with reality.
---
People will use what‚Äôs good. Last word is good, and hand cannons are good in general too. Side arms, as seen by the rat king can never be good.
---
Smgs too, for PvP at least, because they are a worse version of auto rifle.
---
In curse of Osiris did anyone use telesto? No? 
---
How about warmind, did anyone use huckleberry? No?
---
‚ÄúNo one seems to like swords‚Äù remember wrath of the machine? Dark drinker was all anyone would use for aksis.
---
And the community is saying enough handcannons because they forget what happens with new exotics.
---
They‚Äôre introducing handcannons after handcannons because they are fan favorites. Whether you like it or not.
---
With how out of touch you are with the game, and what happens with new things, I‚Äôd think you‚Äôre a developer from the vanilla era.
---
Rampage ends up fading out before you get to use kill clip in combination with it if you don't have drop mag
---
Cydes a  waifu too smh 
---
Oof
---
I have that, its free Outlaw without kill
---
Excuse me where the fuck is Ada? 
---
It‚Äôs fine because it can only generate a max of 5 orbs. A tether or blade barrage is actually better for the team. Striker is really one good for solo play. And it‚Äôs ass for boss damage. 
---
A OEM user that has skill, oh wait those don‚Äôt exist either 
---
I see more of a Dark Souls theme with the Pope. 
---
Well since you deleted the other one, I'll put the gist of my response here. You're wrong. Peacekeepers are a very good exotic, just outclassed. And yes, the handcannons outclass the other exotics because of the quantity and PvP aspect. (And in case you didnt know, you can only have one exotic weapon equipped at a time.) Smgs are more close range and higher RPM then auto rifles, and sidearms are perfectly fine. I never said auto rifles were a bad example I said *swords were*. If you bothered to read my comment instead of picking and choosing. And no one seems to favor *Destiny 2's* swords. I know how D1 worked, thanks. And again, handcannons arent "fan favorites". I've seen plenty more people want Bad Juju back, for example then the handcannons. And how many people want other exotics? Oh yeah, almost everyone.
---
Lol no.
---
Sounds like there were better options, but my experience with the gameplay wasn‚Äôt all that great.  Movement also felt sluggish and clunky, and overall I got the feeling that the game isn‚Äôt for me.
---
Hopefully they are able to resolve some of the issues and it lives up to at least a bit of the hype for those interested anyway.
---
Nope. Use what you like.
---
What I see: a pedophile apologist 
---
And if they feel extra assholeish,they can wait for you to pop your super then nope it and kill you so you dont get to come back
---
And the tracking in the shields is retarded,a dude tossed a shield around 4 corners and below me AND HE HIT ME DIRECTLY IN THE FACE
---
That's the spirit!
---
Yeah! :D
---
My Name Is Byf does a good lore reading on the Book of Shadows. Listening to it lately on my walk to work, rekindled my love for the game
---
Could you explain?
---
On behalf of all Catholics, I can say this is a quality meme.
---
Jessie you spent 1200 legendary shards on cores! What‚Äôs wrong with you?!
---
This has actually happened
---
You can win with anything if you are good. Give me dust rock, Luna, and coil and give cammycakes two sidearms and a potato pancake and I‚Äôm putting my money on him. 
---
I‚Äôm willing to assign your success with the Polaris Lance mostly to you and not the weapon (though I am a fan of it). 
---
I like your style
---
The mission before that is what actually unlocks the forge. You should see it on the map already and can launch it if you go there. 
---
The frame is basically just a free frame but even that counts toward your two for the week so you won‚Äôt actually be missing out on much. 
---
It wasnt broken or all that good but it was fun and a challenge to do good with which is what i want not a broken op ass exotic. Also yes its simple but it was absolutely beautiful 
---
That‚Äôs a really nice way of saying they‚Äôd be in a stress coma lol. 
---
OEM?
---
Yeah rng permitting it's probably the most efficient method to obtain cores. 600 shards will net you 3000 simulation seeds when Spider is selling them at 5 for a shard. Turning all of them in will get you a dozen or so cores from dismantling. A few mod components, occasionally an exotic and his shaders dismantle into a shard too so after you've done you get most of your shards back. 
---
Any planetary vendor will work but the shaders give you better returns. So you can do it over til you're out of shards. It's not fast. And it's dull. And your RNG mileage will vary. 
---
That's awesome! Just saying. 
---
not rly. Stuff like does not compute and polaris lance can three-shot to the head.
---
Forsaken Legendary includes the base plus all DLCs through Forsaken (not the annual pass). I know that Activision has Forsaken Legendary on sale on amazon (PS4 is less than $30).
---
Annual Pass is an extra $35, but if bundled (Forsaken Legendary +Annual Pass) it is usually $5.00 off or so.  You do not need the annual pass until you hit 600 light, so you have a lot of content to play until you reach that lvl.  So unless you just gotta have it right now you could wait and get it later.
---
It‚Äôs definitely not OP by any means. I‚Äôm just saying scouts can be effective right now, especially in QP. The legendary version is actually pretty good too and gives you the ability to run coil or traction cannot or chaperone. 
---
Because FDA won‚Äôt enforce their censership and it‚Äôs spinning out of control.
---
Sure thing, good luck, I've been trying to get that for quite a while and no luck so far. 
---
The pain was real
---
Sure she is but, one of my favorite characters. She acts how I‚Äôd expect a powerful member of nobility to act. Sophisticated, stuck up but, knows when her ass is so deep in shit she needs help. 
---
Byf always gets me hyped and theorizing about the game, My friend and I both watch him and go over our ideas afterwards
---
I am about that screeb lyfe
---
Last night was particularly bad for connection errors from my area. Fireteam kept getting booted for various animal related errors.
---
But did you throw enough grenades?
---
Home girl Petra knows whats up. 
---
[https://imgur.com/a/CqubgOm](https://imgur.com/a/CqubgOm)
---
yes, I did a couple of...edits. 
---
No
---
I see that in any religion 
---
The quest was a joke. Hardest part was the proto thorn standoff.
---
Heres the problem. People who think its balanced can't count to three. 
---
Dodge is definitely really strong, but I wouldn't say it's by far stronger than shield. They offer different things. You can't hold a spot better than with a shield, it forces the engagements to be on your terms if you can use it well
---
Point is is that Hhsn is a real sitting duck moment while shoulder charges at least leave some room to improvise if the charge isnt going to work.
---
They need to just remove it for now. It literally is a joke how simple pvp is with a titan for me.
---
This seems more charitable than most epithets given to shotgunners. 
---
So that one time sample means it doesn't work. I used 1000 shards to do this, walked away after 2 hours with 40 cores and 680 Shards and a couple exotics.
---
Did that start?
---
‚ÄúPeople use hand cannons because of the quantity‚Äù I take it back. That‚Äôs the dumbest thing anyone said.
---
Smgs are closer range than scouts! And when you get murdered fast for being close range, guess what happens.
---
People want bad juju back over first curse because it was more usable than first curse, and they want bad juju back because that gun was a Beauty to use. 
---
Peacekeeper are indeed outclassed, which is why no one uses them. Same for swords, side arms and just about everything that isn‚Äôt meta.
---
Hand cannons are the poster child of hunters, and might as well be for destiny as a whole.
---
You accuse me of cherry picking your argument but you just didn‚Äôt address the idea that no one would use new exotics. 
---
So, tell me, who‚Äôs cherry picking?
---
Or in my cases the physics engine just decides you die, as you‚Äôre slamming the heart
---
That's cuz anyone who can aim use hunter so if they give us anything at all we dominate
---
What about fucking warlocks?
---
Would be interesting twist if you had choose alliance to Drifter or Shin. 
---
Because Midnight Coupe, you fuck
---
Is it that great?  I'm a pretty bad PvP player but find when I use this it  just shows me who's coming to kill me.
---
Yep, helped a clanmate t through his first time last week. I ran a fireteam medallion, he got the ship.  I put down the game for the rest of the week.  The RNG on the ship is ridiculously low for it to be tied to an activity that is only avialable once every three weeks.  I need the ship and the shell, don't seem to be able to get either one. 
---
Don't tease me with Sparrow Racing. 
---
It doesn't give you cores more often, it's just that you get more shards back, so you get more chances at cores with the same amount of shards
---
He also used the wrong format
---
No one will make it beyond a few hundred viewers in today's current standing because all of the established streamers are where everyone flocks. There are people on twitch everynight with some of the best gameplay you will see, but they get less than 100 viewers because no one cares, people just want the entertainment value that larger streamers provide. 
---
Yeah, restarting put it into the collection so that seemed to work for anyone else with the same issue
---
I did the Draw in mayhem on my Titan. Blocking damage makes banner shield drain faster, so if that super has been up for a while your beam could go through eventually. 
---
Especially the taken phalanx, ugh give me nightmares the things 
---
I know but three weapons out of 25 nodes seems too lucky to me I'm over 150 opened and I have got only 2 of the weapons
---
All part of the learning process. You have to fail to succeed. 
---
Yep.  And the second that I posted this, I found that out.  Great.
---
I‚Äôm so confused now. Why would you say the Monarque is good? It just supports my position
---
And also, I‚Äôve seen one or two people use it, if that.
---
We must be playing radically different games.
---
I‚Äôm a hand cannon noob üôä last word is the first hand cannon I‚Äôve used 
---
I have never heard of this happening before. By "the sparrow," you mean Harbinger's Echo, right? 
---
The Corrupted needs to roll back around. I want that pulse rifle in my life.
---
F
---
We had 7 nightfalls the second reset hit and Corrupted was one of them.  Bungie fixed it though.  R.I.P.
---
You probably play on PS4 but if you play on Xbox I can help.
---
I agree. Half the time they shot back even after I'd shot their weapons :(
---
Lol. Not necessarily idiotic, I just feel like most people gravitate towards Blast Furnace. I'm on Xbox, though and I think it's more popular on PC. Wanna make sure I'm not being too silly..
---
That was just on
---
Worm gods and ahamkara are nor the same breed. That is speculation and not confirmed. Books of Sorrow btw. 
---
The Last Word quest is either really easy for you or really hard for you. If you are a decent player you just play for a while and get there, whether that takes 4 games or 10 games. If you are bad you can‚Äôt brute force your way through as a few bad games can wipe out all your progress. 
---
I think Malfeasance is probably straightforward for those on teams. Playing solo it was tough to get everything lined up for successful invading. Either I didn‚Äôt have ammo or my teammate was camping the portal. Also the RNG to even get started made it ‚Äúharder.‚Äù 
---
Carry teams will cost you real $$ 99% of the time, so dont count on them unless you are rich and can throw away money. Just Google Destiny LFG, wont take more than 5 min to find a group. As to whether or not it's worth it... that's up to you. Do you have the time to spend playing for hours on end keeping a streak going? Do you have the time to only 4-5 headshot kills a game when you need 100 total? Its a huge time commitment. 
---
Well of Radiance is amazing for Blind Well/Gambit/Raids.
---
Spectral Blades are really good now, especially in pvp.
---
Blade Barrage is awesome for boss dps or clearing adds.
---
Chaos Reach is super fun, great for bosses.
---
Haven't used Burning Maul much, don't think it's as useful.
---
You‚Äôre week late there buddy.
---
Titan: OOF
---
Time zone is pst and sounds good thank you 
---
By worth trying this season i meant is it possible with the time left in this season
---
can't spell succeed without succ
---
Like when does the season end
---
Having worked for a very small but similar kind of business, I'm sure that reports are reviewed by someone in tech / customer support. With certain functions it's a question of how to implement a solution that will prohibit or prevent unbalanced play without negatively affecting other players or mechanics of the game (particularly with things like spawn camping). 
---
On the flip side, I'm sure they ignore plenty of reports for issues they have no intention/way of addressing any time soon or in the future, and it would be nice for them to communicate such things, but they probably don't in order to save face as well as keep the possibility open. "We're aware and working on it" is all that usually ends up to be, though, too. xD
---
Zone into the leviathan raid. Don‚Äôt have to do anything, just zone in and leave. Bene should be available after. That worked for me anyways.
---
I got it from a random ascendant challenge chest like 2 weeks ago 
---
Honestly we may be, I get killed by it quite a bit in crucible xd
---
Black Scorpion is a boss now. I have kind of a bad roll, but it has Snapshot Sights and I threw a Radar Tuner on it. Performs really well at mid and long range, and pairs really well with Chaperone.
---
Yeah I noticed that hunters get killed more a while back too. It really is a funny way of showing which class is the most popular. Well either that or the average hunter is less skilled and just dies more...
---
Cool, thats kinda weird that is just dropped like that. 
---
ƒ∞t woukd be nice if they buffed the presicion multiplier like they did in d2 when snipers where really bad, i dont think nerfing a weapon type(pulses) to bring scout rifles up is a good choice since nerfs are hurting players god toll weapons that they maybe putted days and hours to farm or to find. 
---
This might be the answer, are you on pc or console?
---
Shucks. Who beat me?
---
Mine is EST live in Michigan 
---
Console
---
Same here gonna grind for the osprey tomorrow then just need 18 kelvins
---
Wrong sparrow lol. I thought you were referencing the DC sparrow. Try restarting your game, that seems to be what most people suggest. 
---
.... That's not how this works. 
---
Funny I said the same thing and was downvoted üòÇ
---
I have been doing that. Does gambit count?
---
I actually do, because I like Polaris Lance but use Thunderlord.
---
Nerf the duration, that's it.
---
Yellow bars will be there?
---
I made a hunter alt recently and my least favorite thing so far is when I throw my knife on top tree golden gun and my fireteam member kills the guy like a split second before it hits
---
Took me a second on that one haha
---
That‚Äôs cool. I tried it a bit after first getting it but other than novelty factor I couldn‚Äôt find a reason to take it over Thunderlord, Whisper, Sleeper, etc but that clip looked awesome.
---
They're better than they were, but still outclassed by basically everything. I know Bungie says the range advantage necessitates a damage disadvantage, but this is ludicrous. I can kill an enemy faster and from farther away with ONLY BODY SHOTS with a Go Figure than I can with the Jade Rabbit.
---
And? Listing a prime example in my favor is supposed to support your point somehow?
---
every mmo has used toon as a term. get over it.
---
You sweet soul, those links are invaluable. Your kindness has blessed me on this day, can‚Äôt thank you enough buddy!
---
Must be because I am actually autistic but I don't get how this makes any sense. 
---
You should just use the best hand cannon, Telesto, and you would mow through these guys...
---
Thanks for sharing anyway, will do!
---
I recently got mines a tad later than most people but I remember the grind all to well. Congrats and enjoy it! You endured and your reward is a literal red beam of death laser gun. 
---
If you use a bow or hand cannon and cant hit these youre just bad
---
Revolvers held 8 rounds sometimes. 
---
Yeah it‚Äôs the Future Perfect Shell. I got it from the Etched Engrams
---
He keeps his great sword in his robes and wields it with his mouth.
---
I‚Äôve been trying to get either one of those exotics and I got them back to back. I can‚Äôt believe it
---
