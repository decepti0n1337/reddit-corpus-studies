LOOT CAVES!!!
---
Only weapon I didn‚Äôt finish in a single run was graviton lance, it took two runs which is pretty insane for 1k cosmology kills
---
This is extremely helpful, thanks!
---
Are the premium season pass rewards retroactive?
---
I suppose you‚Äôre right I think this one is important to experience first hand and I love the lore of this being the hardest thing to do in the game, I guess I‚Äôm also a little salty about getting to a point in the raid where 6 Darci‚Äôs couldn‚Äôt do the necessary dps.  You definitely won‚Äôt be disappointed by this raid though
---
Are you saying Tony Stark has more muscle than Thor and Captain America?
---
I feel ya. My D1 group on Xbox One was such a tight crew and I loved playing with them. Took a couple years off and built a gaming PC and picked up D2. Now I simply can't find any group that compares. I'm still getting ready for the new raid but not looking forward to finding a good group to play with.
---
When the invasion starts, look at the sky for a big vex "cloud" under it you will find the gate lords
---
Play the free stuff, invest more if you enjoy it. If you want to know the story, check out YouTuber "My name is Byf".
---
Same. All my PS4 1%er buddies went to PC. Now I'm a universal backpack when I run solo.
---
This... Does put a smile on my face
---
No problem
---
It‚Äôs the small things that count
---
You‚Äôre looking in on a different direction to both a lost sector and the Whisper of the Worm Dungeon. I know this because I explored an exploit before that allowed you to glitch into this area from a completely different place and glitch back into the Dungeon further along the jump puzzle. Saving time.
---
Touche
---
No one exotic armor and weapon
---
Everything drops 2.0 now
---
Im more into understanding the systems and how 2 get things tutorials rather than the story but thanks for the advice :)
---
Hahah hell yeah! Take your time, lol you're doing just fine. üòÇ
---
No
---
6 ft tall and must hold at least 4 world records
---
Do tower bounties work?
---

---
Never mind. I just answered my own question. They do.
---
They actually did it wtf.
---
So i made a new character just to do the campaign again but the tutorial was really short and it just sent me straight to the traveler? Where can I find the campaign?
---
I was standing by one of the NPCs and he was talking about cayde being dead, so did the game just skip everything for the new players???
---
I haven‚Äôt really tried the weapons out too much but it is at least worth the powerful rewards. And it‚Äôs fun, like a shorter menagerie. 
---
Actually, it is worth doing to get the new seasonal armor though. You can‚Äôt equip the dreambane mod on older armor, they don‚Äôt have the slot.
---
Anyone else got Control vibes too? I played that before Shadowkeep and all the floating spirits remind me of the I guess husks floating around in that game. Plus they both have a red color to them.
---
Whats yours Steam name or Steam Code?
---
Just gimme my arca plasmor in Destiny and Thunderlord in Warframe and I'll be happy
---
I think you ment ‚ÄúThe lord of Destiny just beat Fortnite on Twitch‚Äù
---
Thanks
---
Well isn't this more about the fact, rather than wording?
---
Yes for 24h. Bungie postet that few hours ago
---
Yeah the forge has to be on a specific day
---
Yeeeaaahhh..... Only noticed after uploading... ):
---
How are people getting so many kills with Fusion Rifle for Loaded Question quest? 
---
I looked around and apparently people are finishing this quest in ~15 strikes. I find myself having a lot of difficulty with running out of ammo so quickly and it's hard to compete kills with other players...
---
Are there any constructs in the Offensive map or Black Garden?
---
I'm seeing this as well on Xbox.  From what I've gathered Bungie is telling everyone you must buy it for each account.  Total BS.
---
You, you deserve medals. This is awesome! Thank you!
---
Go to the lunar battle ground and there's a large cave. Keep going and it'll be there.
---
About strikes and matching the sindge. Do all weapons need to match it or do I just need to have one equipped.  Does killing with the weapon matter?
---
If u do the exotic quest banshee gave u at the start of the season after u beat the special mission u can pull it from collections
---
I'm not sure just started doing the first quest
---
The moon is open to everyone
---
Well that's going to be my guess.
---
Good luck bud.
---
Your a pussy lol let them enjoy the moment
---
You're welcome, now we all just need to figure out how to proceed.
---
I think the first mission is free
---
People are reporting shadowkeep is shared but the seasons aren't
---
You need to find small rice cakes. They drop randomly from stuff on the moon
---
u/vredditdownloader
---
That's odd I'm guessing that you can't do any quests there?
---
Is there a construct in the offensive map?
---
All classes have a single support option, in the sense of subclass. Class abilities for titans and warlocks are team oriented while hunters are a solo.
---
 
---
Hunters have tethers that slow down, disorient, and weaken enemies as well as dealing damage for one enemy hit to all tethered.
---
Warlocks can place down healing or damage-boosting rifts. Their support Super places down a large well Via a sword plunged into the ground, gives overshield, damage boost, and constant healing at much greater levels than the smaller one.
---
Titans Class abilities are physical shields that provide cover or increased reload speed. They have a support super that places a large dome that blocks all incoming damage, gives shields to those inside, and can increase damage as well. Although cannot be shot out of.
---
We have no Intel on further class changes or additions. Some speculation but nothing solid :/
---
Hope that all helps :)

I'm guessing you're doing some catalyst farming?
---
Thank you, i wasn't entirely sure. Appreciate it.
---
Not sure. I feel bad running a Vex Offensive and ignoring the group to go find this but I could run and see if I can find something.
---
Yeah while playing I made melee F like DOOM and out if habit I keep hitting F like it‚Äôs going to perform a finisher. So just having it to one keybind would be a nice option.
---
If you opened the Cryptoglyph to get to that page, you neeed to put in the code that was inside before you could view that.
---
K. Well all I said was that you used to get an exotic engram at the end of the campaign and bungie removed it. Nothing I said was "slightly incorrect". It was all correct
---
Correct
---
i know stuff from gambit, crucible and vanguard xan be re aquired...but check your progress because it may reset to the beginning, others are world drops, and youbjust have tobget the drip again
---
What platform? I‚Äôve done two today?
---
I know, I was just memeing.
---
On xbox
---
The vex turret that sits still and shoots out void blasts from its cannon/eye in its center. Once it gets damaged enough it just goes apeshit. It‚Äôs not a common enemy and usually it‚Äôs pretty easy to deal with. But in the raid it‚Äôs a complete different story
---
Two dudes game sharing and one didnt get the battle pass.
---
It's bad I know.
---
Brother slayer. Spawn killer.
---
I know I was just hating on warlocks lol
---
Ah I‚Äôm on PC
---
Oh,ok. So if I create new characters will i have to start from the very beginning like when it first came out ?
---
Anyone have the classes/trees they used?
---
I just started playing again so take my advice however you want, but generally if you see something big and has a yellow health bar, then start using your Power weapon.
---
As for Ulti, it really depends. Some ults are good for mob clearing, some are good for nuking a single target. I play a lot of Arc Warlock and the ult is practically useless against bosses so it's reserved for mob clearing.
---
When I‚Äôm on my hunter i usually run revoker recluse or revoker Luna‚Äôs howl and for a heavy I usually run hammerhead. And for an exotic I run stompeez
---
That's pretty shitty tbh, damn Bungie
---
Keep getting titan armor on warlock as well.
---
You can only do the forge of the day now. It‚Äôs RNG. All weapons can be forged at whatever the forge of the day is.
---
Yea but after the campaign you don't go here anymore so this is a way to go into it again to explore or to get cool pictures or to hide and seek idk
---
Working on that catalyst I see.
---
Had no clue this was a thing. Very strange.
---
Ohhhh wow. I cannot believe I didn't pick up on that. Thanks!
---
Maybe both of you should both pay for a game that developers sink thousands of man hours into making instead of complaining when you can‚Äôt fully cheat the system? 
---
I mean, it‚Äôs basically like saying ‚Äúhey bungie, give us free stuff because we deserve it for playing your game‚Äù
---
If it‚Äôs worth their time, then it‚Äôs worth your money.
---
Everyone got boosted to 750 with the shadowkeep patch
---
Its not look up pictures
---
It took me longer than it should have to realize that as well. I was super confused at first.
---
Currently working on how to get to the elevator.
---
YouTube
---
Your comment was not optiomal
---
Try watching one of Dattos videos to know how to get kps (karma per second)
---
It‚Äôs one of the changes that came with Shadowkeep. Not really a fan of the change but meh.
---
Twitch clip playback sucks so badly.
---
Traveller moved the moon closer when it added the atmosphere- looks cooler that way and you can hear the bang bang boom booms.
---
750 is the new zero.
---
Tell them to line up faster!
---
it would be in your quests
---
I can relate.
---
But why the leviatan raid is 750?
---
Did you mean anticlimactic?
---
And yes, you get Sun Warrior from it, regardless of what Sunbreaker tree you're on

So new light players can jump in and do end game right away with people who have been playing. It‚Äôs to give people a taste of what end game is like in hopes they will purchase forsaken/Shadowkeep.
---
I cried haha
---
You really want snap shot or quick draw over range finder. But box breathing is nice
---
Also next step is to kill vex on moon but step after is where we‚Äôre stumped
---
I think they confirmed they'd be doing this with those old guns.
---
You never showed us how it ends :(
---
xD I'm just generally curious I literally started for the first time today. loving it so far but want wondering if/how it messed it up for long time players. I've seen a lot of people complain but nobody says why lol. is there actually something messing it up for veterans? or are people just nagging to nag? idk how long it takes to get to 750 but I've only played like 6-8 hours and I'm like  807? or somewhere around there. may be different at lower lvls but it doesn't seem too bad.
---
That was quick lol
---
Just roam one area for long enough and they spawn in, I got lucky and had 4 spawn in and then a overlord
---
Don't agree, but you do you.
---
End story, titans are dicks
---
Ahem... Victoria 2?
---
People are just salty because they felt it took away from what they accomplished/paid for. It effects them none.
---
Awesome thanks!
---
Thank you!
---
After playing through Doom recently, I made up my titan to look like the Doom Slayer and went on a Perfect Paradox rampage. Rip and tear!
---
Bungie just unlocked the Chaperone
---
True, I'm only saying it in the context of wanting Bungie to take the WoW approach to Destiny and just keep piling things on. It hasn't really worked that well for Blizzard.
---
Unfortunately, Bungie forces you to purchase Dlc for each platform you want to play on. For example I own shadowkeep on PS4, then tried to play on PC with the same account, and realized it won‚Äôt let me play any of the new content unless I buy Shadowkeep on PC as well.
---
It‚Äôs silly.
---
Yes but PVP doesn‚Äôt force you into PvE. I‚Äôm not against PvP, those who love it, great! But I really wish it would stop pushing me to go ‚Äúhey *play PVP* even though your playtime suggests you‚Äôve spent about 0.5% of your time in it‚Äù
---
Should probably start at r/Fireteams. Probably should also start with what you play on... light level, and gamer tag/PSN/Steam ID.
---
I'd love to see a paper bag transmog that is only available for characters that are over three years old
---
I think every videogames subreddit that‚Äôs somewhat popular have atleast one posts where their viewer count surpassed Fortnite, holy fuck the fortnite bad shit is getting annoying
---
Most things are random you could try for whisper but its kinda a pain. If you have/can do shadow keep you can just keep doing the essence of vanity from the lectern for practically nothing and that will guarantee you a tranquility sniper with a diffrent role until you're happy
---
Except it‚Äôs not. As soon as you get to the tower, you‚Äôre being given bounties to go drop in to it, you‚Äôre being given quests to do it, your clan is being asked to compete matches, the banner tournaments opens, etc.
---
Woh forgot to get back to you. Do you have purple 2.0 armor?
---
Similar problem here. Had to go into collections then into flair then into finishers and re-acquire the finisher for the class.
---
I finished red war back while destiny was on bnet, was thinking of doing it again on new light only for the exotic but now i see its not even worth it, is it really true that it doesnt give exotics anymore?
---
It‚Äôs a quest called joy and suffering, and pain and gain. Takes place there
---
Crashed on GF twice at end of second wave before boss. As soon as you hit that 20th.
---
‚ÄúSpectral blades is OP‚Äù
---
This is excellent advice. I‚Äôd say something similar about heavies though. Some are better for add clear, like machine guns. A sniper rifle will actually do more damage to a boss than a machine gun, so you‚Äôre better off using it to get rid of majors, or enemies that are giving you trouble. Same with swords
---
Oh. Didn't know that was a thing. Thanks for the info.
---
Not even 30 mins ago :)
---
Ok thank you, is it a 1time use or can you keep going back?
---
I got my Ace personally from the first crucible match I did this expansion but I assume that was just extremely lucky. But it seems to drop from Nightfall Crucible and Strikes
---
Onetime per character I believe
---
Ok thank you
---
Exactly. At least 2 weeks unless you‚Äôre the most efficient person on the planet. I should be rewarded for grinding. Just like the guys who spent 2000 tokens to get to 940/950 day 1. Except I‚Äôm doing arguably more grinding and getting less for it. Just seems like their way of saying ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt play more than 1 of the same character. You will play all 3 classes, and you will like it and if you dont you‚Äôll be significantly set back compared to those who just suck it up and do what we want‚Äù
---
It's glitched. It's pretty good if you main a warlock and use a titan as well.
---
As mine. Good to see destiny back on top
---
But couldn't it be the Darkness working through the Vex?
---
Kind of hard to answer. Shadowkeep is more current and actually has a lot of content. Forsaken has the better campaign, and has 3 raids vs Shadowkeeps 1, but all of the daily/weekly grind stuff from forsaken is outdated and won‚Äôt give you powerful gear. I‚Äôd personally say Shadowkeep if you wanna play the game regularly, but forsaken if you just want to experience the campaign
---
 I think the fact it's 3rd person means it'll never be a true competitive game to me, and the act of building in itself takes the "shooter" essence out of the game. Because you can be good at building and only somewhat decent at shooting to win games. But if you're bad at building, well the better builder usually wins. It's just awkward and not for me. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Plus they went and made some guns hitscan and others have travel time, which to me makes the game just feel odd when you have a sniper that takes 2 seconds to reach a target or a silenced pistol that takes 0 (granted only one of them will actually deal decent damage)
---
Its random, you said it yourself...
---
He dun runnin real good
---
- person with the IQ of one of those hackers.
---
Ha,  forge bound!
---
They fixed that. :(
---
I scraped all mine,  fuck it. There is plenty to get now.
---
Yeah, just go straight into the campaign. All your old gear will have auto leveled up and you‚Äôll get new stuff quickly. I‚Äôd keep any quests for cool gear, like exotic or pinnacle quests, but I figure you can ditch everything else. Any important quests can be reaquired from their vendor anyway
---
Then die
---
24 hours from raid launch, not a week
---
I play gunslinger 99% of the time
---
I just like the way the staff meele works in pve
---
And the reload bonus is nice
---
6 hours? Bungo you slippin!!
---
Get it yourself? Or play snipes/pulses/scouts and pick them off from a distance? Sure it‚Äôs annoying but I just put on stompee high jump mountaintop Luna‚Äôs howl and trash them. If your a titan use OEM. It‚Äôs easily the best pvp exotic between all classes. Warlock, use blink to evade it, hunter throw stompees on and high jump out of it
---
Hey folks, 1st post here so go easy. I put together a rough video guide of where and how to get the first quest step for the exotic Divinity trace rifle. Quest step being: "Divine Fragmentation" hope this helps some of you out. üëçüôÇ
---
it's for worldline zero, an exotic sword, watch datto's video on it and you should understand how these things work
---
I want to keep it this way for a week or two then let the sweats show up and bitch slap us all back to 0. Because I don't know about you but right now its like shooting fish in a barrel.
---
Theoretically Speaking, yes, However since were still in the Black Pyramid and not actually the Black Garden, it makes more sense.
---
Remember, we were never back on board the Flagship, we were never Back in the Watchertower of the Reef, Or back in Croata's Arena. It was all a projection from the Darkness.
---
I main a warlock but use all 3. Currently all over 900... exhausting...
---

#KNOW YOUR FUCKING PLACE, TRASH
---
All of their replicas have always been explicitly miniatures.
---
Yeetus deletus
---
It's still a raid and you do it with five other people. Get a team and run the raid.
---
Then do a raid
---
Right so with the release of shadowkeep, Every guardian, including all the items in their inventory, got bumped up to 750 so you can start working towards the new cap of 960, and there are some items like eververse bounty notes that are no longer useful, in my opinion I would just look up the item, see what the current state of it is, and then just dismantle it if it's useless
---
Fire teams are normally 3 man groups. The new vex incursion may allow more in a team as it's a 6 man activity. The raids allow more people in a fireteam.
---
Where did you find this?
---
Yes
---
100% a cheater, like no question about it.  Thats not lag or nothing, consistent insane speed.  Report him.
---
Good
---
I believe the forge rotates to a different one every day now.
---
The one and only ramen shop at the Traveler.
---
Your Ram is fine, your video card is not that good but it is able to run destiny pretty well.
---
I have seen in several questions that all have something in common: the game crashes at the boss fight. 
---
I recommend checking for viruses (Idk how it would help but worth a try, cracked games included), and do the itegrity scan (or how it's called on steam).
---
Yeah season passes are now tied to your bungie account and can not be game shared. Cant wait till the games and expansion are also tied to your bungie account üò∂
---
That would be horrible, I guarantee you over 90% of the people that play eso literally skip all the dialogue the quest giver gives them and then just speed runs the quest for a crap reward, exploring the city would be nice but I don‚Äôt know about all that mmo stuff
---
I thought so. This is fantastic, it‚Äôs like they put that up because they truly loved him as a customer. It makes you feel like they were impacted by his death. I love this.
---
I meant cosmetic engrams, that response really makes me doubt you‚Äôre a d1 vet if you have an issue with micro transactions then maybe you shouldn‚Äôt play games at all.
---
Warframe is a different game they can do what they want, it doesn‚Äôt suit destiny update structure at all, this game requires constant updates and expansions to keep alive as soon as the revenue gets shut off so will the updates and the game will die if you had kept in touch with this game for the past year and a bit you would understand this, the content drought between roi and d2s launch was a good example of this as well.
---
‚ÄúWhy shouldn‚Äôt it be free?‚Äù Because forsaken was d2 biggest dlc and best dlc, it also includes that whole years worth of content on top of this that have already made the entire first year of content free as well as some base stuff from both forsaken and shadowkeep, they‚Äôve already done more for free shit then destiny 1 so why don‚Äôt you complain about d1 then? Even d1 had a worse ever verse and micro transactions, you didn‚Äôt get nearly as much eververse gear for just playing the game.
---
But you‚Äôre basing it off something you haven‚Äôt experienced and that instantly reduces the validity of your point.
---
That last comment again shows me how out of touch you are with destiny 2 and games in general.
---
If this is a troll then i commend you because you seriously tricked me into thinking you believe this.
---
Spoiler tag pls
---
Is unlocking the forges even needed then?
---
Meh, only worth it if people are willing to teach. They indeed are beautiful, i enjoyed CoS a lot and also LW up until Riven a few times.
---
Play 1 character until 900, then do all powerfuls. Send highest guns from 1st character to 2nd, do powerfuls. Send from 2nd to 3rd, do powerfuls (only works if 1 of each class)
---
Rather not spend up to 24hrs trying to figure out mechanics whilst already sleep deprived haha
---
There is a Forsaken icon on tangled shore map for Forsaken.  If you see Amanda in the tower right side of map older quests.  It is daunting but working through ones on your quest tab will start to make sense and some disappear some open future quests.
---
and as a warlock, i get super happy when im not the only one in a strike or crucible game XD and not to toot my own horn but since im pretty good at pvp sometimes it feels like im pooping on kids with my supers, but still i just feel like we can be improved upon, it feels like we have been forgotten by bungo
---
‚òéÔ∏è Shin Malphur ? Yes this comment right here Hiroshima his ass
---
Snipers &gt; Scouts anyway
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/490605365
---
If you have either dlc, do those stories. That's forsaken or shadowkeep.
---
Else, you can do any of the 3 "legacy" missions (Red yellow or blue one. On Mars, murcury, or top of the tower map).
---
Or you can start working on getting the best gear from activities. Strikes are a good way to get to 900 power, then it's down to powerful gear activities which will be labelled when you unlock them. 
---
You could also work on exotic quests you have or pinnacle quests from vendors. 
---
YouTube content is a good way to learn what's good and what's not. 
---
I was never in support of giving new players everything as soon as they start, but I understand why they did it.
---
Not yet but in the future you'll be able to summon a redjack bot that helps
---
Nope
---
I dont understand what do you mean by lackluster? Too easy to use? Or too weak?
---
I am running glaviton lance + naz sins at the moment. Unlimited void build
---
Hand cannons(Not Forgotten/Luna's Howl, Ace of Spades, Spare Rations, and Trust) , SMGs(Recluse) Snipers, Fusion Rifles(Erentil), and Grenade Launchers(Mountain Top and some other one I forgot the name of). 
---
As far as power goes, still semi optional to player style, but I think grenade launchers are the way to go.
---
This is for console
---
Edit: pulse rifles, namely Bygones, are also doing great.
---
Nice. How are you enjoying Shadowkeep, do you guys recommend it?
---
Same here. I can't complete the forsaken story now
---
EDIT: They are no longer adventures, they are missions. launched by clicking the banner on tangled shore map
---
I just downloaded destiny 2 yesterday again after 2 years. I have over 1000 hours in d1. What do your emblems mean if you dont mind me asking?
---
How is your power so high already?
---
Go left after you land at tower. Head down and around until you find an npc called amanda Holliday. 
---
From her you can launch all previous campaign/dlc (sometimes now called legacy) missions. Order is red war(base)&gt;curse of osiris&gt;warmind&gt;forsaken&gt; shadowkeep. 
---
You start at 750 now after recent changes but can tackle story in any order you like.
---
 You would have to pay for forsaken and shadowkeep if you want them but you can hit max level without either (just takes longer). 
---
The changes are a bit jarring for existing players and utterly overwhelming for new players. 
---
I'd suggest playin through in the intended order, gives you plenty of free content.
---
Hope this has helped a little, there are some great people here and most questions have been asked/answered in last few days so hit the search bar if need more help. 
---
Happy hunting
---
All campaign progress was reset if you weren't at the end. You have to start from the  beginning by talking to Amanda now.
---
fortnite bad
---
Gun power level does actually have an effect on damage, but your average power level is much more important.
---
It‚Äôs been so long since I‚Äôve played D1, and I‚Äôve only just started playing D2. I really don‚Äôt have a frame of reference, but the game devs seem pretty active. I think you guys‚Äôll have your fix
---
must be a titan. only titans are that big of jerks
---
Thank you
---
Hmm alright thanks for the info!
---
So this boils down to read what your shit does.... with that said I am always happy to help new players learn the game :)
---
Also arc bottom tree can give souls to your allies and you via rift
---
What system
---
Bungie's comment in response to the forum post about the bug:
---
"Hi there,
---
Thanks for your report. Destiny 2 services are currently seeing a high volume of traffic that could be interfering with certain processes and activities. Please try again later.
---
Update: We're currently investigating this issue. It appears that this is only affecting Xbox players."
---
Looks like it'll be a bit until they fix it.
---
Source: https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Post/253727976?sort=0&amp;page=0
---
Why did the last wish take 20+ hrs then?
---
Go to program files(x86)-&gt;steam-&gt;steamapps&gt;common-&gt;destiny 2-&gt;fonts-&gt; destiny keys-&gt;install. Go to character map, scroll down until you find the icon you want. Copy it, paste it in your steam name.
---
Haha, I got really excited at first too, but then I remembered J3zs' video on it and I was like "Oh nonono, you can't fool me!"
---
yeah warframe literally drops you after the tutorial with no directions or incentive to continue
---
Probably just a lack of processing power/ network issues to the servers maybe
---
Y E E T
---
Ahh, yeah. My friends and I made it this week. I thought my clan lead said he got rewards, but it makes sense now. Thanks!
---
I don't know if it's necessarily fair to imagine that Bungie isn't interested in user satisfaction. I'm sure that if they posted a poll for it on their twitter and people voted in favor of a system like this, they wouldn't hesitate to provide it.
---
That‚Äôs sick. Thanks!
---
 I assume you haven't gotten any new weapon mods.
---
When you eventually get them, because mods are now permanently unlocked and reusable, they won't show up in inventory tab.
---
Instead, they will show up when you hover over the mod slot.
---
So, you just have to grind until the new mods to drop, and replace the old ones with the new ones.
---
I am struggling constantly for space on weapons ... how do I manage that? Do I dismantle everything I don't use.
---
Are you suggesting I was looking for porn on YouTube?
---
I dont have any friends to do it with :( I've never done a raid before even in d1
---
Exotic weapons are fine. Exotic armors are the problem. If you want to use the new amor mods, you have to pull the armor out from the collection.
---
There is a vault at the Tower where you can store unwanted items. You can find it between Lord Shaxx and Banshee-44. You can also use the Destiny 2 companion app to transfer items between characters and the vault.
---
As someone that's made it to the 3rd encounter, raiding since the release, I don't think it's extremely unreasonable. Some groups have put 4-5 hours of attempts on that one specific encounter in with their group before one member had to go. I think it's pretty understandable to not want to invest additional time catching someone up to speed after those hours. They're looking for other people whose groups have fragmented but generally know what to do, not players who want to go fresh without hours under their belt.
---
However, that only applies to groups that are already part way through the raid. Anyone starting the raid fresh should have few to no requirements aside from power level, because it shows your group didn't really know anything if they wiped in the first hallway.
---
maybe hand cannons are short ranged scout rifles
---
As he did in forsaken
---
I have no idea what is up with it then. I have no clue if this will even work, but maybe reload the game and hope it fixes itself. If that doesn't work and no body gets back to you by tomorrow then you could submit a ticket to bungie to find out what's wrong.
---
Vex offensive is dope. Always wanted 6-man strikes since sometimes raids can be a time sink. Hope they do more things just like it
---
So how does it actualy work because im new and kind of stuck on 900 right now.
---
It's been 5 days since shadowkeep launch.
---
There was an exploit at launch where warlocks would get powerful titan armor from weak motes. I guess they couldn‚Äôt fix it right away so they removed it as a temporary solution.
---
Ignore all of the Destiny fan boys.
---
Reddit is a terrible place for Destiny feedback.
---
Bring this up on the actual bungie forums and people will agree with you.
---
Fucking Epic exclusive bullshit!!!
---
This would be a cool feature tbh, especially when using lfg
---
Bounties from everybody gives you loads of xp. Try tie in bounties from the gunsmith. Zavala and Ikora. If your version of Ikora has bounties without shadow keep. You can do strikes to get a few bounties done at once. Pick bounties up from shaxx for crucible. Bounties from Gambito man for gambit. Also get some weapon forges and bounties from Ada. Each planet has a person that also gives bounties. It's a grind but it's the best way to get that do you need for the gun you want
---
[deleted]
---
Try and find a clan. Use discord https://discord.gg/9dMrAc it's a great way to find clans and fireteams
---
Im pretty sure you still get randomised stats for every piece of armour
---
It‚Äôs a 920 PL activity right? Then you can do damage. Bungie changed how damage works when you are underpowered and have stretched it so you can be 100 under the activity number and still do damage so if you are only 20 under you can still take on the activity without too much issue. I played one of the new strikes as part of the story (so was solo) 30 levels under and completed it without much issue. It‚Äôs all set out in the patch notes.
---
Seems like what has happened here is you have matched with new guardians who are inexperienced and still trying to get to grips with the game.
---
Fight forever guardian!!!!
---
We found 3 of these types of things
---
okay
---
Got the Xbox discord?
---
Jesus Datto calm down we‚Äôve won the war against fortnite okay jeez
---
That is fair.
---
Maybe its an experience thing, but in my older wiser, years, i always interrogate everything in a new game that i can find.
---
I have discovered much this way that i would not have otherwise known for some time.
---
If its any consoloation, most RPG style games never tell the full story from the tutorial. I know you said you are a shooter fan, but destiny is a lot more than just a shooter.
---
No I opened it from the shortcut or from the normal steam library and it usually works fine
---
Unfortunately not. Google should hold the answers you seek
---
Same it was the most fun ever,  need more things like this.
---
Go to Amanda Holliday and get Red War campaign. Should be on top when you talk to her.  Its the starting story, original main campaign.
---
Thanks for your help but I realized I'm incredibly stupid and I unequipped my primary weapon I've fixed it now noob moment aha
---
No problem. I'm glad you got it figured out!
---
Give it a bash on Big-Picture mode and see how you get on, thats how I always run Steam games with a controller and I never have any issues! It's a rectangle looking icon up at the top right of the Steam window.
---
Entitled much?
---
I will try tht
---
If your brain isn't developed enough at your age to handle those simple mechanics and enemies before the final round, you really really should go back to Warframe until you can play games made for adults, sonny.
---
I apologize for giving your mental abilities way too much credit in my other reply.
---
You just described every destiny release lol
---
Was Bungie not extremely greedy and dumb when it came to their decisions for this game even before they got into bed with Activision? Yes they were, so is this supposed to change any of that now that they are not with Activision.. I do not get it
---
Yeah probably.
---
Garden was a hard raid
---
You'r shelling out money for an expansion that happens once a year man, they aren't even charging for the season pass this year. I dont get why you are crying. No one is forcing you to buy eververse stuff, its all cosmetics anyways. Do you not remember the Battlefront 2 shit, people are definitely not ok with loot boxes giving a gameplay advantage. I don't know what claim you are trying to make but its failing.
---
Strikes. Gambit. Flashpoint. Nightmare hunt. Replay first mission on moon. Vex Offensive.
---
Free reward on Bungie.net rewards.
---
Prime engrams seem to drop more often so doing anything can help.
---
You just need 3 good players going at it. I did it with a friend and a random without cheesing it. Took a few tries but we got it.
---
I'm not.  The new light mission is pulled straight from destiny 1... Where we didn't have a class ability....
---
i'm a new player aswell but correct me if im wrong. not dying in raids and strikes? gives you a flawless bonus that ends in much better loot.
---
If you wipe, you start over. If all guardians die that is.
---
I reached 902 power and decided to do some nightfall: the ordeal because of the weekly challenge, i completed the 5 mission and continued to get 100k points but never managed to get the other challenge done, its still incomplete after 6 tries. Anyone know how to complete it and get the pinnacle gear?
---
But shadowkeep was much more hyped up than forsaken and the other dlcs so it might stay for longer than the others
---
Yeah, same. What make us think even more that it is going to be a patrol zone is that you can meet other players there.
---
That's exactly what friends in Destiny do though.  
---
Push each other into oblivion the second someone goes afk.
---
And a year ago people were saying "Forsaken is way more hyped and bigger than any other DLC this will bring Destiny back" and look what happened there. 
---
Simply put to stay at the top of Twitch Destiny physically needs a dedicated hardcore PVP mode or its never going to happen.
---
This still evident
---
There‚Äôs no consequence to death, but in some activities if everyone participating in them is dead, the encounter will restart at a checkpoint, so you cant just keep throwing yourself at bad guys without a care if that‚Äôs the case. You‚Äôll know if this is going on when you see a bunch of swirly lines on the edge of your screen and a skull pops up in the middle of your screen saying ‚Äúrespawns restricted‚Äù.
---
at least there isn't another unnecessary launcher for just this game, this is the price to pay for that decision.
---
First you don‚Äôt need to mock me secondly i kind of just over reacted. The quests a nice concept since it lets you get a general idea of what the weapons like but being reset after getting close after so many attempts is just painful
---
Yeah but who won?
---
you wined and said you were leaving for warframe. yes i needed to mock you
---
Also need to note that it's not just about what you have equipped. The drops are based off of your highest possible power, so that includes stuff you can equip in your inventory or Vault too.
---
Short answer: If you like the base game, then Forsaken is a Must Have.  It adds a ton of content. Go get it!
---
Not sure, pretty much lost that with the blizzard to steam transfer, but It took me about less than 30 hours to get my fill of curse of osiris, not much to do there at all, and warmind I got 45, but that's because of RNG fucking me over for the guns. The base game Didn't take too long to beat, did leviathan within 60 hours and played mostly crucible from there until gambit came out. Also the reason Modern warfare 2 costed so much is because [they spent so much of it on marketing](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/96227-How-Much-Did-Modern-Warfare-2-Cost-to-Make), not the game itself (Activision just seems to be throwing money into the wind here), either way its launch sales yielded it at least another billion dollars. (D1 costed not 500 but closer to)[https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-budget-nowhere-near-500-million-bungie-says/1100-6420802/budget/] (140-200 million)[https://documents.latimes.com/bungie-activision-contract/], I can imagine Destiny 2 following a similar suit (destiny 1 produced 1Billion in revenue, similar applies to D2), so not much different from modern warfare 2 which was released back in 2009. For final fantasy 7 it was a game about 6 years after the first console was ever produces, the industry was in its infancy so it was a major gamble, the game came with several disks if I recall, and there was no virtual storefront, so more physical compass required delivering and advertising was a very hit or miss thing. Today it's not nearly as hard to produce or sell a game thanks to our new technologies and increase in the gaming population/field and virtual storefronts which are trying hard to compete with each other now. Plenty of indie games are making plenty of money nowadays like risk of rain 2 (made by only 2 people), shovel knight (costing 1.5 million to make with exceptional profits), Terraria has made exceptional sales, hyper light drifter, ect. ect. Most of these games have no physical copies to speak of, or advert campaigns all thanks to how the virtual storefront. Only AAA's do that to compete with each other.
---
i just played the game and made it to 900 before the end of the dlc
---
Dead ghost...
---
Thank you. I am going to check it out!
---
Thanks for helping!!
---
Trove farm on the moon is rapid
---
Time to go on a paper trail that leads nowhere
---
Really you play on Xbox?
---
I kill them them so fast and haven't got the 4th boss at all
---
And exactly 69 leviathan completions
---
Honestly would get shadow keep first since all the new gear will help you power up, then if you dig it get forsaken for dat recluse/mountain top combo
---
What console are you on? If your on Xbox, you can join my clan. We have 1000+ members so there‚Äôs always something going on
---
Hover over the frame in quests, and itll tell you. You get a core near artifacts edge on jesus. Kill the yellow bar enemy, and get a core from the box thingy.
---
Thanks for the info, I thought it would drop with raid.
---
I also found you can "sift through the ashes" which gives you another quest
---
I‚Äôll pay you 17 for it
---
Bro, I saw Lawenf0rcement kill 6kidsinavan
---
there was a vidoc from bungie that showed either a 1013 or 1016...someone may have clipped it and posted as themselves...it will be possible but no one has it currently
---
Ahh that great, thank you all.
---
Not played since the original release so about time to start afresh with all the expansions.
---
I‚Äôm one of them that uses it. But weirdly enough only for destiny. Every other game I play I use mouse and keyboard lol
---
See  not fucking crazy
---
There‚Äôs no playlists named ‚ÄúComp‚Äù anymore; instead we have 3v3 Survival, which still awards Glory points, which is the competitive ranking system. There are two versions, one is normal, and one is solo queue exclusive.
---
Only 8 hours? i tried that for over 10 and i feel like im dying inside cuz we cant finish the third encounter
---
All the different raids are launched from different planets / locations:
---
Nessus - Leviathan (and the raid lairs)
---
Dreaming City - Last Wish
---
Earth - Scourge of the Past
---
Nessus - Crown of Sorrow
---
Moon - Garden if Salvation
---
But, you‚Äôll need a fire team of 6. No match making for those bad boys. 
---
Exotics can either be quest based or random drops whilst playing. More likely to get exotics once you start doing powerful rewards (after you reach 900 you‚Äôll see these).
---
Only your level doesn't matter in pvp generally. I'm going in with my yr2 gear rocking a 780 level toon. Use what you are comfortable with and what will benefit you, like I have good armor perks on 1.0 and so I'm using that til I get some 2.0 that I like.
---
I can't hear kudzu without thinking if Bobiverse
---
Then why are they so much better at it?
---
Raids are on different planets, the first one is on nessus, along with the next 2 "lairs" last wish is dreaming city. New one is moon. Tho you aren't high enough to do the new one
---
bad connection i guess, my internet's super crap tho. sometimes it goes super unstable.
---
Are you done already?
---
Didn‚Äôt the cutscene play after completing the last weekly for Mara Sov or something?
---
lmfao, i've never quit a game holy crap, being a toxic like you ain't helpful though.
---
I'm already over it I just like playing the game. The changes have put more people in the crucible, more people in the raids, and patrol spaces are more populated. I call that a win.
---
Regional pricing is a thing
---
As I said, I'm new, so could you inform me what eververse is? And do you know of any website or something that I could use to look at armor sets to find one that catches my interest?
---
Using VPN for buying games cheaper than they cost in your homeland is violation of Steam's SSA and can lead to permanent ban. In addition, recently Steam forbid to pay with card if it's emitent country differs from your Steam region.
---
To sum up : using VPN will have no use since you'll not gonna be able to pay for game, but also it means you can be banned for SSA violation.
---
*World of Warcraft leaves the chat*

It appears randomly

Cant watch this, you wasting your super. That hurts
---
Exactly, 75 meter Erentil gives me every time turbo cancer.
---
This is the fucking problem with this game. I am a toddler. Hold my hand and explain exactly what the fuck to do. IN THE FUCKING GAME!!!!!!! Part of the quest is to go out on the internet to find out what to do? Fuck you Bungie.

The eververse is a store in the tower with cosmetics you can buy rather with bright dust which is a free currency you get in game doing certain bounties and you can also buy with silver which is a real life paid currency, and for the armors, if you go to the character screen and you go to your collections and into armors you can look all of the available ones
---
From what i can tell. Everything up to but excluding forsaken, is f2p. I checked on oct 2, that i own evrything but forsaken and Shadowkeep (SK being understandable) when i never paid for destiny 2 before hand (played it when it was ps+ free and bought D1 3 times over, both cuz acti and my own stupidity)

Turkey is the second worst currency against dollar and we have to pay five times more than argentina? this is just unfair.

Did you do the omnigul mission to unlock the table?

Just done it and nothing happened no last word quest I have tried everything any advice?

Yeah I've seen that, but I think it'd be nice to see the set together, but in the collection you only seem to be able to see one piece at a time.
---
I think you may  be confused when buying shadowkeep you were given a free season (undying) not a free season pass. So you get the vex stuff.
---
I believe so, I have no other missions available https://imgur.com/a/5s2FKoW

You need to wait like a minute after the public event

This isn‚Äôt dankmemes or the pewdiepie sub

These are the meme formats I come for
---
I told my friend I could take a screenshot every 30 seconds while playing and all would be wallpaper worthy. My favorite was seeing Mercury as the Vex arrived. More than just a gorgeous landscape, it made me think of how much work Bungie put into a tiny section of the story that you'll see for 30 seconds and never again. The amount of detail they crammed into every crevasse of this game is mindboggling.
---
Also adore all the races they came up with. It's Halo + Warhammer 2K... what more could you ask for?
---
Well if you go to each planet and you speak with the vendors and you inspect the engram they have you can see the armors the have all at the same time
---
I'm not correcting anything but just in case someone is wondering how/when to do all this. When I hit 900 it gave a quest. You need to complete 3 "challenges" detailed in the link below and find/decrypt 2 prime engrams.

I had it on default at first, everything mostly low at 1080p, it crashed. So I tried everything on high, still ran great, but crashes

Ok thanks, also which pinnacle weapons are worth the grind? I‚Äôm still good at crucible, so I want to know what is worth spending time on

It makes perfect sense. Your boots are disabled for the first 24hours if the raid.

Special gambit boss

Ok thanks, also which pinnacle weapons are worth the grind? I‚Äôm still good at crucible, so I want to know what is worth spending time on.

I got comp score of 2038 and still had to get the rest of my 100 wins so I went to unranked as to not lose my comp glory score.  Waiting on the weekly reset to hit the 2100
---
You can get the armor again, I think, from the alter across from Eris. But that only work if you have the alter unlocked
---
Yeah its horrible as a new free to play player, i just got to 900 light lvl and i got like 40 quests and no idea what are good quest. 
---
Everytime i ulock a new planet i have a mission to go there, and there i get 2 or 3 missions aswel. 
---
But befor i finish those i can go to the next planet and get 2 or 3 missions again. 
---
So now im lvl 900 still dont know what to do, where to go etc. 
---
Im thinking about buying the newest dlc and just stay on the moon.. but i hear you still have to go to other planets for the better 900+ items.
---
Cross play connection just transfer character
---
Enable cross save
---
Yeah, it sucks. Some of my friends play this, and I just seen it was free to play on steam, so I wanted to check it out, lol.
---
Ah cool, thank you very much.
---
?
---
I'll give it a go
---
It‚Äôs like y‚Äôall don‚Äôt just take 2 seconds to read through the 30 other people that have posted the exact same thing today.
---
During the campaign the tower is unavailable for a little while, the farm is the hub replacing it.
---
That said, the tower isn‚Äôt on the Earth map, it‚Äôs a separate ‚Äúplanet‚Äù on the system map.
---
When that one guy in crucible has a god roll waking vigil
---
Maybe a 343 reference? Like that one d1 map with the pillars lining up
---
Sure but after reset you should be able to go back to comp right?
---
That's just large clan in general, if you play wow you'll see clans advertising 1000+ members when most of those are inactive
---
Cross-platform is only for moving character you‚Äôre working on, 
---
Should try going for the camping before getting a group. Would advice getting a clan to get the extra loot.
---
Good luck
---
That's malfeasance
---
Watched my clan find this room and 4(i think) adjacent rooms with the same hole or some sort ofnsmall hole that lets you see into the next room.  They also found a cube to break but it was just out of view behind another white wall.
---
They were thinking itd be a similar function as the beam that connects you in the 2nd encounter.
---
If you go back out the way you came to the big canyon, there are other entrances farther down.
---
I made a second character and got hit with all this buckshot. I‚Äôm like, why I ain‚Äôt no kinderguardian lmao
---
Gotta ask but which hand cannon is that in the gif?
---
I am pretty sure I was there the first time I played? I did one mission, then I was in a place that was high and had a lot of NPCs?
---
Thank you so much for the kind words, that helped me feel much better!
---
Paragon grieves (your exotic legs) we‚Äôre disabled for the challenge mode of the raid because they were putting out a crazy amount of damage with shotguns that had 1-2 punch. There was a small glitch that allowed you to shoot a shotgun from the hip right before shoulder charging in the air. With the exotic it was doing enough damage to literally kill Greg two times over. So your legs have a light level of 0 for the time being.
---
Two of my friends just got destiny, one is really confused and I have no idea what the other one is doing.
---
I shot his face twice and was like ‚Äúoh right.‚Äù Helping a bud along he remarked that he didn‚Äôt have a crit spot and I told him to the glowy chest bit.

No one knows atm
---
If they're from year one, you can get them back from the collections tab in your character sheet, but you can't get gear that doesn't drop with guaranteed perks back - e.g. I can get a year one Origin Story because it always has the exact same stats, but I can't pull a Mindbender's Ambition out of collections because it can drop with any number of different perks.
---
Defnitely the micromini xd
---
any chance for them to reappear again? like for example if I dismantled the Drang?
---
I tried going to Spider, and he just had bounties for me.  It really seemed like an end-of-game thing (I could've been that far along, it's been awhile), and Shadowkeep really isn't on my radar.  I usually skip a lot of cutscenes, but what was going on didn't seem at all familiar to me, and that last level and boss seemed a lot easier than all the ones with different shield set-ups that I had been used to facing in Forsaken.  Between that and the silly Light reset, I'm thinking to just start a new character next time I play.
---
Appreciate your options again it does nothing to stop the company‚Äôs out there conducting business off others wants in the game. So let me know when you‚Äôre ready to stand out front of those companies businesses to protect I‚Äôm there brother. Until then don‚Äôt attack the guy trying to do the same thing a million times cheaper.
---
I've been kicked from a few Gambit matches in the past resulting in a 1 day suspension from Gambit. Don't threaten me with a good time bungo. But for real, this is a serious problem.
---
You can take it from the collection or from an NPC
---
I think you should be able to get drang from you collections because only random perk weps are unable to get from collections
---
Hahahahahahaha

---
And if you want to start forsaken you laugh from the tangled shore at the bottom of the map
---
That's right Dwayne, you **better** sip that tea with your daughter.

Lmao he wasted like 4 shotgun shells and instead of finishing them off with something else he decided to waste his super on those four critical hp goblins. One shot them with arc staff from the start or use something else don‚Äôt waste both.

Last time I played was the week that Blizzard gave away destiny 2 for free on Battle.net. I played the first mission, logged out on the Farm and never played again until 10 minutes ago when I first logged in (after transfering my account progress over to the main game). I'm immediately faced with 2 major issues:

1. I originally played on a Titan Awoken Female. Someone recommended me to make a Warlock, so I made one, logged in and immediately logged back out and back into my Titan. The problem is that somehow I'm now on a giant tower somewhere instead of the Farm and I have no idea what to do.
---
2. I live in Flanders. The game for some reason decided to throw me in a FRENCH server. I'd MUCH MUCH MUCH rather play on an English server, obviously, because why the fuck would I learn French for a videogame? Is this possible?
---
Will look thanks
---
The ikelos weapons are always good, and crimson is a must have with the perks it has. Forsaken has a bunch of good guns from dust rock blues to the duke mk 44 to mindbenders ambition
---
Nice.
---
If anything last word is more viable than ever with all the others having their range reduced
---
They're pretty common drops tbh
---
only one person ever asked me for gum every time i took it out and it was a girl. i'm pretty sure she liked me and that's why she did it...
---
Can we ad a "Za" in front of that?
---
It'll seem weird but open the store. Bottom tab, I think says where to start each expansion.
---
#NICE
---
what part is confusing for you?
---
If you open the 'map' menu there should be a quest tab. Click on the bounty and you can see progress when you hold out your ghost
---
My friend can‚Äôt get his light back and he needs it so we can play, he says he needs 770 light. I can‚Äôt help him a lot because I beat the campaign before this update and it said where to go. (I‚Äôm playing on pc)
---
It wasn't your post, it was because you're not using dark mode.
---
It‚Äôs funny cause trying to guide my buddies around is actually like taking care of children lol
---
If you open the director and go left (I think) over to where it says quests, it should appear on the right hand side of that page.
---
I'm not entirely sure about the Exotics that you get in the campaign tbh.
---
thats the problem, they have no risk right now
---
everyone using them, because the op
---
Exactly.
---
Nice
---
If your running two Ram sticks try taking one out and see if the game crashes. If it does put it back in and try the other one. It could possibly be a faulty ram
---
Yeah it's quite easy and you don't need to do it in an absolute mind numbing manner. You can do it faster by going to mars and using resonate stems.
---
Me too... I‚Äôm out of fingers and toes to count how many Sherpa runs of the Whisper of the Worm quest I‚Äôve done whether it‚Äôs for friends or people I run into on IO
---
You need to get a group of six people together to do one. Probably should save it for when you're more experienced.
---
Spent the past few days farming comp, and I reached fabled and finally got the recluse with this new system.
---
Do you know what snipers are designed for? One shot kills.
---
You start at 750 light now.
---
Have him bank his items and make a new character for the new DLC content.
---
Yikes I'm at 13%. Am I allowed to replay missions in the European dead zone? Or are there more campaign missions in the euro dead zone that I can do?
---
Go see Holiday in the Tower. She assigns the storyline quest beginnings
---
Thanks I found it.
---
No worries!
---
Guess the vault got shattered huh?
---
i know, but then they should have a way higher aim down sight time or less stability
---
Oh I see! I‚Äôll be purchasing Shadowkeep in a few weeks so I‚Äôll have plenty of time to put together a fireteam, in the meantime I‚Äôll do a few regular nightfall strikes!
---
West of sunfall 7 is still great, I am currently waiting for a vex invasion that seems to take a lifetime to complete the quest line to pick up the reskinned version. I will admit I am excited to try a different roll.
---
Alright, thanks man
---
Gtfo here lol people like you that cry about everything ruin the his game.
---
They spawn after Public Events are completed.
---
‚ÄòYo put that Tractor Canon on, it‚Äôs a solid bop!‚Äô
---
Ok, thanks man, also is there any specific way to get them? Or is up to Papa RNG to get them?
---
Fuck you Activision you greedy fucks
---
Here's the port forwarding table from the link in OP:
---
#### Ports that should be FORWARDED INBOUND
---
|Platform| TCP Destination Ports|UDP Destination Ports|
---
|:-|:-|:-|
---
|PS4| 1935, 3478-3480 | 3074, 3478-3479 |
---
|XBox ONE| 3074 | 88, 500, 1200, 3074, 3544, 4500 |
---
|PC| N/A | 3074,¬†3097 |
---
There is another table of ports that should be open/unblocked.
---
it was our first time and we switched out a guy since he had to go somewhere so we had to teach him what to do we got the hang of it at the end either way had a good time 10/10
---
My friend said he had lots of quests and he didn't know what to do, I now see what he means
---
I don't want to choose yet but I am getting annoyed that I can't complete the introduction quest even though I completed two bounty quests for him.  The quest says get some bounties from the gambit and the turn them in. I did that but the quest is still incomplete.
---
and the average number of skeletons inside a human body is higher than 1, i dont give a shit about exceptions because they dont make rules
---
Red War campaign will take the longest, but will help set the mood for the remainder of the game.

I mean the crack itself is scary lol, but pupils getting big isn‚Äôt really crazy. Happens with LSD and sometimes shrooms
---
If you cross saved it probably has put the season pass on the fresh new character Steam account not the existing character from console/pc.
---
It‚Äôs probably just something that carried over from D1, back when some rockets could hold two shots(and I believe more with clown cartridge.)
---
Even then, stability was still pretty useless tho.
---
there's an I in "Guardian Down" and everytime I see one of those morons who rushed ahead and got themselves killed while me and the other person were taking our time doing the bounties  I dab on his ghost and don't res.
---
Only 13 power? I'm at season rank 12 and have 5 power already? Seems like the co requirements skyrocket at some point
---
it's right before the last boss
---
is t here no other way to infuse outside of using that upgrade material? I am lke 18 hours in and I have 11. That seems ridiculous. I don't want to be forced to wear certain armor just because it has a slightly higher number

Try dropping one that you can pick up later, maybe that solves it.
---
Thanks mate, I saw the rules too late and shoulda looked first. Cheers.
---
I didn't make a new character
---
Hey I was looking for a clan to join to help me understand the game and also just to have fun with. I joined one last night but they seem to be focused mostly on completing the new raid (which is totally cool, but I won't be there for awhile).
---
May i use this so i can ask for help. Im trying to do some raids like leviathan and the garden and riven yet i cant due too my own clan not doing anything.
---
I run fullscreen for marginally increased fps so it actually collapses the game window every time I whisper...insanity.
---
Totally unnecessary üòÇ
---
Just 900.  You pretty much have to rely on Powerful Gear emblems.  High level gear also drops in raids and maybe some other high-level endgame content.
---
Have you checked how much silver you have?  I read in some circumstances silver was added to cover 1 years pass.
---
Nicely done, my man. May it be the first of many!
---
Ok thanks
---
If your on PC I can invite you to ours. A lot of us work full time and just try to play together whenever we can.
---
The medals were easy, the multi kills took atleast 10 hours to finish from 35%.
---
Ok.
---
No worries. You want to make it to that first room with about 10minutes on the clock.
---
- To do this you should put on any exotics that will help your jumping and learn all the short cuts. You have 2 major ones that will cut your time in half. 
---
‚Ä¢lost sector short cut and green room short cut. 
---
*For the fighting rooms you need to switch to an exotic that will help your super instead of jumping. 
---
Weapons: 
---
-solar and void are the main enemies. 
---
‚Ä¢you will want to use a shot gun for blights and knights.
---
‚Ä¢pluse rifles and scouts are also good.
---
[ I switched to a pluse rifle for the psyion room right before the boss room. When you run out of heavy ammo you'll want to use a pluse or scout to use on the boss. ]
---
‚Ä¢sub machine, auto rifle, and basically any good ad clearer for the enemies.
---
-use a heavy weapon that has a lot of ammo and range. Don't waste heavy! Save it for the boss. 
---
‚Ä¢machine guns
---
‚Ä¢sleeper
---
*Tips and extra info.*
---
‚Ä¢Don't waste time killing blights in the rooms. You just need to kill the enemies. The only blight you should kill is the one right in front of the door in the room before the Psyion room. You need to do this because 2 phalex will spawn behind you once you run through that door to the psyion room.
---
‚Ä¢You should make it to the boss room with roughly 6minutes. 
---
‚Ä¢KILL ALL OF THE BLIGHTS IN THE BOSS ROOM then kill the arc shielded phalexs which will make the boss spawn. 
---
‚Ä¢Use your supers on the taken captain. He needs to die first. Trust me.
---
‚Ä¢Hang Back where you drop down at and just shoot from there. Otherwise you'll die to endless ads. The ads won't come up to where you are. 
---
‚Ä¢Use damage supers! Don't use bubble, well, or
---
 teather. 
---
*My Load Out and Methods.
---
-threat level (any shotgun works.) 
---
-recluse/last perdition (both void weapons. Any pluse or scout works.)
---
-Whisper/Machine gun (thunderlord or hammerhead will work perfectly fine.)
---
‚Ä¢I switch from recluse to last perdition once I reach the psyion room.
---
‚Ä¢I take out the captain, phalex, then knight. 
---
‚Ä¢Arc Staff super. 
---
---------------------------
---
If you have any questions then you can feel free to ask. I know it's a lot to read, but I hope this helps you. I am on Xbox, so I have no clue if things work differently or are better/worse on PC. Best of luck to you !!
---
I have heard of others that just keep re-trying the purchase to get past the error message. My issue was more freezing while processing.
---
But keep in mind, you can‚Äôt reaquire randomized loot (forsaken and after) so if you get a great roll you should hold on to it
---
Amanda holliday. She's the one selling ships and cycles in the hangar of the tower (the place in tower you don't need to do anything).
---
Did you get silver instead? I read somewhere that a few had problems and they received the amount in silver I sad to be able to buy the seasons that way.
---
If you have Shadowkeep digital deluxe you will have everything for next 12 months.  The only exception is content in Eververse for silver like finishers, weapon skins etc.
---
I think he means the new light system as in everyone starting at 750,OP may have had a glitch where he didn't go up to 750 so they're wondering if they delete their char and make a new one will they be 750 light, OP, please correct me if im wrong.
---
Having only done the first encounter, I absolutely love the mechanics in that part. Sadly can't speak about the rest of them yet.
---
I cant even get to the screen to choose a payment option
---
Bit like past content wise?
---
Serves em right lol
---
Use the destiny 2 companion app for fireteams
---
Or r/fireteams
---
I'm a kinderguardian. I definitely appreciate the help from my fellow guardians!
---
I bought forsaken too
---
How to get it tho?
---
I love it.  mechanics are awesome and the scenery is gorgeous.
---
Hey man if you want some people to play with dm me and I‚Äôll get you an invite to my discord. We‚Äôre all in a clan but if you don‚Äôt want to join you don‚Äôt have to
---
They nerfed exotic drop rates, so they would feel more rare
---
Random drop
---
Edit: sorry, it is available from banshee packages only
---
If you have last year's Forsaken and this year's Shadowkeep you have everything in the game as the base game and the dlcs at the beginning are free.
---
Been trying out D2 over the weekend and I gotta say it is really confusing for a new player.. After I found a way to play the old storyline it started to get a bit more organized but before that it was like: here's a planet, there's a planet, this is a strike, this is nightfallen thingie, crucible is a thing and so on and so on. 
---
I get it Bungie, there's a lot of shit there but honestly, after playing for 5-6 hours I found the campaign which contained the rest of the tutorial.... Would have been nice to take a little more time before you just shotgunned me with every type of content.
---
Hnnnnng
---
I did, I haven't received any silver.
---
Legend. I pour a cup of tea and then finish it and just move onüòÇ
---
Thanks.  Thats all i needed.  Hey, can uou just explain how this games content works now?
---
Google discord destiny lfg, should be the first one.
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs part of season of the undying, which comes with Shadowkeep. I‚Äôm not sure if you can buy it separately
---
Dang it. That seems silly. Guess I'm hoping next week is the one I need for Izanagi burden quest line.
---
Also, Thank you!
---
You're lucky you only played for an hour. Try reaching Bungie.
---
He‚Äôs always talking shit tbh.      
---
I like the line that he says ‚Äú You‚Äôre second, just like Zavala is second to me ‚Äú
---
Yeah that's an annoying fight. Just watch some YouTube vids get the mechanics and boss it
---
I bought Destiny 2 when it was first released then stopped playing for like a year then had to re learn everything all over again once it got good
---
I‚Äôd just jump into the Shadowkeep campaign and go from there. You can catch up on the Year 2 stuff at your own pace
---
outlaw kill clip hasn't been a godroll for pvp since atleast a year and for especially for pve never  been
---
keep the sidearm its one of the better ones, great roll, and hand cannons got shit on with nerfs in pvp 
---
for pve sidearms are actually one of the highest dps primaries even though not popular at all
---
Doing small bounties will give small rewards, try something else and quit complaining about a thing you have 2 months to do. With about 20 hours in the week it was out I‚Äôm at level 30 something. So you are doing something wrong.
---
I thought of that, but 30-45 minutes later, I checked his livestream and he was at 5500 glory.
---
No problem my guy! If you are on ps4 feel free to add me, we can get you in the clan and get you some easy rewards!
---
Sunlock for life
---
ok that might be my issue. I still completed them (both with the highest kills on the team) but I did a strike or Mars? I believe and a nightfall with 2 of my buddies yesterday. it was just frustrating. I felt like I basically got one shot in the nightfall. glad to know I can aim well since I got the highest kill count in both but yea I died a lot... I'll stay away from those for now. ty! this helped a lot.
---
rip. On pc sorry
---
Get it from collections
---
battlenet
---
There‚Äôs a spreadsheet on the sticky that shows godrolls. Scrap everything that is not exotic and not on that list.
---
Ok, i didnt think of that thank you.
---
Use your vault in the tower to store any weapons you arnt actively using. You dont need to keep duplicates of legendaries either, so that clears up space as well through fusion and dismantling.
---
No, it would honestly be of no help during either encounter
---
I don‚Äôt think all chests count towards it. It has to be chests you find out in the wild, public events and lost sectors don‚Äôt count
---
I meant to glitch out of the zone.
---
O-O das a lot, and quite complicated but, thx, I‚Äôll keep at it
---
Thanks mate
---
It‚Äôs the main event of the pass, you‚Äôre essentially doing a demo
---
Have you screamed kobie?
---
Well they might drop with lower power than the blues but with legendaries you can infuse them to higher power so if you find a gun you like the perks on you can keep it with you the rest of the game and keep infusing it up in power. 
---
But it‚Äôs all about how you feel and do with the guns so if you don‚Äôt like how it shoots don‚Äôt worry about it you‚Äôll get tons more throughout the game. And also most blue weapons have legendary counterparts that are better versions that shoot the same way!
---
Loadouts.
---
BD?
---
It‚Äôs on a timer that isn‚Äôt mentioned. You basically have to kill the invader immediately.
---
Now that you say that I think I remember seeing one in there too, Bungie knew what they were doing lmao
---
OK thx
---
now you only have to find the screen capture feature, good luck!
---
There are many other streaming services but it seems OP has a decent graphics card in the laptop.
---
not necessarily mobility intense. although I do like it. someone pointed out the fov and I'm almost positive that's it. I normally play with fov maxed so this super narrow view is messing with my head a lot. I really hope the add a slider for that eventually. it already has 3rd person for swords so I just feel like they should add it. there's not much of a reason not to. just my thoughts though
---
Just play the strikes it'll match you with people
---
I‚Äôm on console like the normie I am so I still gotta find out that
---
My only thought is you can either go talk to Amanda Holiday at the Tower, go talk to Devrim Kay in the EDZ, or just look on the Earth Map for any kind of mission that says ‚ÄúRed War.‚Äù
---
Worst case scenario, if anything isn‚Äôt working the way it should, you can just start a new character. You‚Äôre not very far in the game anyway lol.
---
I‚Äôve done it twice and I‚Äôve been by myself twice
---
I think it's because its Heroic. Try bringing up your ghost, I find sometimes that gives a hint. Or look on youtube for a guide.
---
Are you clicking a specific strike or are you doing the strike playlist?
---
Yeah, I lost my yr 1 cayde chest in this are to this change. Left it there for him and now it's gone forever.
---
Within 10 seconds of the invader spawning
---
you can't really choose better and worse ones since they do different stuff and therefore are good for different stuff and playstyle mostly 
---
still you can say bottom nightstalker is the worst one like of all for kinda everything lol
---
I had a quest to do the night fall strike so i press that one specifically and I get it by myself
---
Who Ever said destiny is dead???
---
I‚Äôm on PS too man I would love to have some people to play with!
---
Yea for sure, also thanks for calling me kiddo, makes me feel young again. :)
---
Hey Mate, 
---
If you take a look down the thread someone else already explained how you get the campaigns going again. Basically you need to Visit Amanda Holiday in the Hangar in the Tower and she can give access to the Red War, Warmind, Curse of Osiris and Forsaken campaigns.
---
that‚Äôs really stupid, you think it would‚Äôve at least put it in your postmaster or something if it was going to do that.
---
or bungie wants to sell shadowkeep and not forsaken?????
---
r/sharditkeepit
---
I personally think it‚Äôs worth it to ignore anything but the campaigns and the exploration quests while learning the game. Follow the Red War campaign and every time you hit a new planet complete all of the bounties that planets NPC offers.
---
The group i followed took about 3 or 4 hours to clear the first encounter. But they totally blocked at the second encounter...do your math...this is really sad.
---
I'm talking about a group of regular raid players, they do tutorials for the french community. Here determination didn't pay off. Sad story.
---
The campaign is separate
---
So he didn't have light in the campaign but did everywhere else
---
Very true, and you're downvoted of course.
---
Oh that's very strange. I'm sorry I've never heard of this happening before. It just sounded like you were checking planetary vendors since they always only have 3 bounties. I don't know what the problem is, but good luck. I hope you solve it.
---
What are some good pvp weapons i can get out of the gate as a new light player?
---
Sir, yes sir.
---
Boo hoo.  Triple-A developer doesn't have enough time or money to make new content without reusing old content.
---
Record a clip and put it on the bug forum
---
can you play that section if youve already played destiny 1? or is it only for people brand new, it'd be cool to see those levels again
---
NeKhornes
---
Who did I tell to not play comp? The dudes with no gear? What experience do you think they're missing out on? Being rolled?üòÇüòÇüòÇ jesus christ hoes rlly mad
---
Even for PvE, dodging out of an Ogres laser gaze late game can be life saving. With effective modifiers, thralls will shred you in seconds, but if you hover and dodge to get away it‚Äôs a game changer.
---
Most late game Dawnbreakers opt for Well of Radiance subclass because it makes a challenging fight turn into a test dummy run. I don‚Äôt think that play style is fun, but to each their own.
---
Had  a friend spend 10 hours on the 3rd encounter alone. They had one person who could not do anything, would have like 3x less final boss damage than everything else and was anchoring the team. The problem was that he was the clan leader so they couldnt remove him.
---
Bungie isn‚Äôt exactly a Triple-A developer. Actually they just lost a very big asset Activision so they‚Äôll have even less money and time.
---
The other planet missions were not "linear" to the campaign. You could do them in addition to the story. The Mars ones are the campaign. You need to see Amanda in the tower hanger to start them.
---
It's so fucking slow if you only use this thing during Crucible
---
I have a different name on ps4. How2L0seURselF
---
You should do in story missions from the directory when they are available (shuffles weekly) and certain quests like for the risk runner.
---
You can't just go and wander around the cosmodrome again though (cries inside).
---
Another thing people don‚Äôt know about too is the fact that this dodge can break the aerial launch of knock backs from big boys. Instead of hitting a wall hard enough to kill you or falling off a cliff edge, you can dodge and it‚Äôll break that aerial effect, giving you control again.
---
What
---
Damn it
---
Some people have been day 1 raiding, watching videos, watching streams, and practicing endlessly to try to beat it week 1. They don't want you to join if you have none of that backing up your gameplay because then they'll have to spend another 4+ hours getting you through the encounter.
---
You are more than welcome to make your own group on the LFG discords. I've seen quite a few groups of blind runs even.
---
Update: game runs terribly on my PC. üòî
---
Oh yeah easily
---
Oh okay thanks, I saw a post where people were saying the Hephaestus adventure was the best for getting kills with Riskrunner so I figured that the adventure would be easily startable.
---
I was earning 1% without double as well
---
hmmm.. worth it for me
---
Yesterday i played my first comp match, i was levelling so didn‚Äôt have the best gear yet i went into it. I‚Äôve played since d1 but comp never excited me and i was a hardcore pve player. At the start i wasn‚Äôt the best but today i got fabled and got recluse and mountaintop. If you tell everyone with sucky gear not to play comp then they will never get better. This game clearly isn‚Äôt for you dude considering we‚Äôre supposed to be helping new players. Get a grip.
---
 To all new guardians, you can do it! Go into comp and try your best! I really enjoy freelance comp as I‚Äôm a solo player, never give up!
---
Yes. DLCs are tied to the platform they are bought on
---
I feel the same brother. I played a shit ton of D1 but D2 is mad confusing. To get the gist of things happening go to Amanda Holiday in the hangar of the tower and she gives you all the questlines for the game
---
I'll check that out
---
Did you know Whisper of the worm is a reskin of a blue year 1 sniper and Revoker is a reskin of a destiny 1 sniper.
---
I checked Zavala first, however *all* bounty vendors only have three options, not just planetary vendors.
---
I‚Äôm light 900, how exactly do I go up to 950? I know all about powerful and prime engrams but am confused on the actual process. Say I‚Äôm 900 and have a 905 helmet and gauntlets, do I still grind for powerful or do I do normal things and the items will drop past 900?
---
Okay but  why would you do that
---
I played D1 but i don‚Äôt remember anything after the first dlc came out üò≠
---
Forsaken raids are probably worth it. Usually people tend to keep running Destiny raids even when they aren't relevant anymore. Still probably plenty of people running them to get the rare exotics to drop, plus if you buy Forsaken you also get the new super trees that came with that expansion!
---
They updated the game, like now players below 900 don't have access to daily/weekly challenges or powerful engrams until 900. Some saved their past weekly bounties but didn't cash them in until shadowkeep released
---
The best stuff is in the grimoire though.
---
I don‚Äôt get it
---
Only when you reach a New rank... Not the sub ranks. So All the ranks with a 1 in it...
---
Will I eventually get to where Destiny 2 starts? Or do I have to buy the new Shadowkeep dlc to access D2?
---
