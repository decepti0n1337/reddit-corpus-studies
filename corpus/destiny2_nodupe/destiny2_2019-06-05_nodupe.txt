Nabbed the Verse by finishing Nesus. It was insane.
---
---
---
I NEED THIS INFORMATION ASAP
---
Get the companion app
---
well shit
---
What are you on about?? You don't need to do any of the bounties.
---
tried that
---
Having the same issue
---
I haven‚Äôt seen any in game tutorials for this.
---
Yeah I did it once and now it wants me to upgrade my chalice in order for me to do it again
---
Collect any triumphs - they give the currency
---
Yeah
---
That would be very nice I concur.
---
totally more than once a week
---
Haven't gotten to play yet today, so I don't know, but a common cause of not matching with other players is not having an open NAT, so you might double check yours and make sure it's open.
---
Old news I‚Äôm afraid
---
It‚Äôs under pursuits for some reason
---
do u have siege? cuz siege better
---
Thought they were going to have a s7 enegram WITH a best of year 1. Not just a best of year 1. Kinda disapointing not going to lie.
---
I was handing in  the drifter allegiance quest to spider and this popped up for a split second
---
i have an open NAT type, it was one of the first things i checked. thank you for the suggestion though! much love
---
That's how I got my protect the runner triumph too. Welcome to the club friend
---
Exactly
---
I‚Äôm still waiting on Nylon Blumpkins Halo movie.
---
Rota was my favorite raid boss lol
---
Ok thanks for confirming
---
can i just use my old one??
---
We need confirmation on this! Those triangle ship bitched ain't got nothing on Ghorn
---
:(
---
This is how Eververse has always been. And some people like these engrams, i hope they'll stay for the next 2 weeks so i can also get year 1 stuff. If it weren't for this, i never would've gotten silver bullet for my crimson. I admit that it's kind of a mess right now and there a lot of stuff in there that needs to be purchased with real cash, i'm not a fan of that at all but bright dust doesn't bother me that much.
---
Trust me, it's not in the game. I don't remember what it's for, how it works, but I know bungie put it in as a troll
---
Yeah thats a pretty big yikes, I wasnt aware that you couldnt get new stuff from engrams.
---
Oh I‚Äôm not sure I didn‚Äôt see that you may be right but you can test it pretty easily
---
Awesome man send me a friend req and I‚Äôll get you in the clan by tomorrow what‚Äôs your username so I accept the right one?
---
Blessed day
---
You got me there! How about "first coupon day of the month?"
---
You won't get karma from putting "first to find", people found those levers hours ago, don't think because it's "early" means it's you who found it
---
I still have night terrors of grinding that ship.
---
Was posted hrs ago so no.
---
Well yes, but still yes lol it is significantly weaker than it was
---
i hate limited time stuff. i have almost everything in the game and im all for giving new chances to get the old stuff. it brings in the audience to think there is still a chance to get that one they missed on and even for old players that can now get that one that got away from them..
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
what i dont like is the fact that everything new cost money... i have almost 20k bright dust and it doesnt do shit for purchases. a few exotics and half of almost 2 years of play and its gone, and if i want anything after that then its real money time or i cant get it?? fuck that! worst direction cosmetics could have ever gone in destiny...

Anything with that little gold dot, and they say challenge on screen there. Flashpoint (Nessus this week) hover over the vendor or Heroic Adventure.

*Russian military
---
While it does apply to US a lot, Russia loooves to occupy and the gear in the OP is Russian, so it's fitting.
---
Sorry, we were in a hurry so I didn‚Äôt even think about the appropriate subreddit to post this on.
---
Opulent day
---
Was I the only one with a fireteam that took like 20 minutes to beat the final boss?
---
Pursuits tab. It's in the director now. Lots of posts about it and it's in the patch notes.
---
Telesto is the besto
---
Haven't played D2 in a while. I'm assuming they took the gun out but why?
---
Tfw most people don't actually care if someone says "that's fucking gay"
---
Dumbass post from dumbass person
---
Its talking about the stuff on the bottom of the cup
---
What class and armor is that?? Looks pretty sic!!
---
Yeah I realized after I posted thisüòÇ, but the way ppl play pisses me off jee
---
How‚Äôd you get imperials quickly ?
---
First encounter you need the buff to kill knights, once the timer runs low you run to the purple ball all of you and shoot it to rotate the buffs. Kill the ogres that pop up on left and right of ball and you have to shoot your ogre, youll know its yours cause u can damage it if not then it says immune, after killing ogres the crystals spaw and to destroy them you need one guy with the buff to shoot it and someone without the buff to shoot it at the same time. And just keep doing that killing ogres for like 4 or 5 phases until you clear. Also people without the buff kill adds. Missing a crystal wipes
---
Second encounter with the crystal is the same thing just have someone go into the shield with the buff and someone without it and thats how you destroy those while  in between the shielded crystals some spawn without it and everyone just shoots and them left to right. Missing a crystal wipe look behind u and on top for crystal spawns.
---
I love this an unreasonable amount.
---
‚Äú3..2..1..Shoot Rota now!‚Äù
---
The throne is ours.
---
Gun still there. Just doesnt give you infinite ammo anymore and everyone is ultra salty about it.
---
&gt;Ophidia Spathe
---
I honestly lost interest in the Hunter after this nerf, I only played the hunter because orpheus made the class feel powerful which is why I play Destiny. I want to feel like a overpowered guardian.
---
The hunter has nothing that feels powerful now, they nerfed the only exotic that felt good for the hunter and buffed none of the other ones.
---
The problem is I dont like the Titan or the Warlock so I am either going to have to play a class I hate or play a class that feels lackluster now.
---
that's true that's true, I'm planning to try to hold 1 or 2 of every rune but my bored ass will likely use them regardless
---
Bungie: "What do you have to say for yourself?"  
---
Xur: "My will wasn't my own."
---
Go to ur triumph tab. U have to hand in the triumph
---
Nope.
---
Is there a post about it already?
---
Not related to post but I wish destiny had a battle pass of emotes and ships and emblems and shit just like every other game
---
Honestly, I just don‚Äôt really care one way or the other. Seems trivial overall
---
Me and the boys going to fight for Emperor Calus, 2019 colorized

__YOU HAVE GROWN FAT IN VIEWERS__
---
I mean, if there are OP (or just really good) weapons that are locked behind a...pay wall...
---
Then yeah, that's technically "pay to win"
---
Yeah it‚Äôs crazy. It‚Äôs bungies fault too though. I feel bad for dattos team in getting baited but shit happens
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/bwszfp/player_at_750_already/
---
Do you need to pick up the transponder that starts it . I missed the week the mission was on Titan but I was able to go into the room where the transponder is on Titan and pick it up.
---
Exactly it does suck but getting 2nd is still really good and on top of that it could have been worse but luckily they were able to secure second.
---
Willing to pay $3 to anyone who wanna get me the fuckin Mountaintop, Recluse, and that new sniper.
---
that's crazy lol
---
Dude, look at everyone responding to this. We're not dealing with educated people. I guess no one cares if they sound like an idiot anymore. And Destiny being labeled pay-to-win is absurd. Unless, like any game on the planet, you pay someone to play for you. In that case, every single game ever made is pay-to-win.
---
Which raid lmao
---
Rune of the beast and Rune of jubilation
---
I logged in at the exact moment the servers went back up and I ended up in a tower where I was the only player.... it was a very lonely start.
---
They probably told Ikora bc last time they went running off without adult supervision it got the Dreaming City cursed and their friend's murderer turned into a Guardian.
---
You talking about corrupted eggs or what?
---
Either way austringer is "keeper of goshawks" same same but different lol
---
Datto was also above Ninja in viewers watching him at one time too
---
The ability to not lose my shit when I get 2nd place in things I complete in does though
---
Hindsight is 20/20
---
Check the FAQ
---
This does put a smile on my face
---
that for sure but the range is def. worse than before. maybe with head head body it‚Äòs ok but it‚Äòs stupid to have to aim for the body after two headshots. I get babooned the last 2 days anyway so I can‚Äòt really test all I want but the range was what I noticed first. 150 rom is nice tho.
---
Direct captures only sorry OP post removed
---
Zelda
---
True, in some encounters other ways are found to beat the boss that don't need whisper, you can't deny that Morgeth was not the challenge it could have been in the long run when you can just sit miles away and melt it with infinite Heavy.
---
To be continued...
---
How exactly did he get baited? Is it known that you get an exotic if you finish the raid first in the world?
---
it looks like bad juju but i don‚Äòt think it‚Äòs confirmed
---
(that izanagi‚Äòs burden catalyst though)
---
*datto screaming in the distance*
---
They need to add a key binding to go to pursuits.
---
They're balancing out what they deem bad vs. what's too good?
---
That‚Äôs what everyone else who is complaining is saying there are saying that bungie baited them which is not true and rediculise.
---
We shall see..    next day.... outside of window......‚ÄùI have gasoline‚Äù
---
That would be a good compromise
---
That's a big ol' oof from me Bob.
---
Oh. My. Fuck.
---
Just to warn you, there are A LOT of snipers. Flanking the hard-scoping ones makes for easy kills.
---
If you are going to commit arson, can you kill me as well?
---
90% of the views came from only a small group of streamers, which makes its overtaking of fortnite even better
---
Poor guy can‚Äôt catch a break lol
---
Because it actually matters who gets world first in a video game....
---
You could play golden gun, top tree is good for ad clear and bottom tree nighthawk is the best single shot damage in game.
---
Jokers wild also didn't end up being called jokers wild. They were just place holder names
---
#SILVAH CHARRIOTTT
---
Keybind would help and you can also sort the pursuits from the top right if that helps.
---
Solar, Void and Arc. There‚Äôs no abyssal.
---
I don't have the game in english sorry for the mistake :) i meant void
---
I reported him on PlayStation for promoting suicide because his profile said ‚Äúif you‚Äôre reading this, kill yourself‚Äù. That‚Äôs the best I could do at this point
---
All gud
---
he is so much more lol
---
Its possible now that they wont have ps4 exclusives
---
Thats becouse cool cloaks
---
i didn't even put link in there lmao 
---
That was just a joke JEEJEEEJJEJEJJEEEEEZUS
---
Couldn't hit boss from that angle, and since all enemies were close together there's no "wrong" way of using it
---
Presuits is just horrible mow, just as the shaders.
---
ace got nerfed as well though
---
Dauntless is epic
---
What weapon do you use?
---
yeah because most destiny players chose hunter at the start
---
It sure is! Hammer user myself, you?
---
as someone that's very poor, I'm down I need money to get my prescriptions. you're probably kidding though. keep in mind I don't play the game but ill try as hard as I can to get it for you. I played at launch lol. unless its against terms of service.
---
totaly don't have a everlasting ult like jugernutt(spectral 2.0)
---
Post removed, no LFG
---
No matter how good they make the Aeon shit, I will still never use it.
---
Ya I know it really sucks
---
If you haven‚Äôt completed the menagerie yet then it is a bug from someone in your clan completing and beating the boss.
---
Outbreak prime rarely leaves my primary, recluse/loaded question in secondary and curated bad omens are my current flavors. I'm also a lock main
---
Destiny's got trees confirmed
---
Yep.

I respect your self-control. I always tell my boss that ‚Äúsomething has come up‚Äù
---
I actually had the 1000 upvote on this. Yay
---
PC
---
On what?
---
So he hides and wear capes and he is all dark and everything just to hide himself from bungo?
---
Stop bully him bungo, you monster.
---
Please mark as spoiler. Haven‚Äôt had the time to get around to it
---
Well there is a right way...
---
Shoot the big boi
---
dont do it ...
---
Thanks for responding, glad it's not happening to just me. I checked the patch notes to see if it was intended but I don't think it was.
---
How boring has d2 become "hold my tree"....
---
You couldn‚Äôt handle your BR‚Äôs... and where did that lead you?  Back to me.
---
The content we all need.
---
I wonder how long it takes till Tess sells Tree ornaments!?
---
The freedom was there at least. Regardless how useful the perks were
---
don't worry 2 much is gonna get nerfed...
---
That‚Äôs not really freedom though. And I‚Äôm not saying I don‚Äôt want that type of subclass tree back at all. I‚Äôm saying that if they do go back to this they should make all of their perks good so there‚Äôs more actual freedom.
---
Ima just use a mouse macro when they hopefully add it
---
Agreed.
---
That D2 had more viewers than any other game for a total of 40 min? outch....
---
On this subreddit
---
That sounds about right.
---
I wonder how well this Emote will Jebait in the crucible.
---
Dude what are you talking about, are you high?
---
First off I had no idea that I would spawn there. I just died so I already had to wait 15 seconds, then waited maybe 5 extra seconds and saw that one guy was already departing and the others were running away from the chest to reopen the chest(the ‚Äòglitch‚Äô to open the chest a second time). Also these  guys hardly revived each other so small chance that they would return back to me to revive me anyway, so I respawned.
---
I hate it.  I view my pursuits to determine my load out for whatever I'm "pursuing" whether it's a quest step or a bounty since many of them are gear specific.  Having the pursuits page right next to the character screen was very useful and quick.  I'm not sure what the benefit is to moving it to the director is.  It's shit in my opinion.
---
Luckily it did not, but I‚Äôm still upset that I didn‚Äôt get my rewards for completing this.
---
TIME TO GET SERIOUS!
---
AND FIXED IT WITH ONLY FLEX TAPE
---
Thanks, but sorry. Im on pc.
---
I have some friends that have almost max level char's at the moment, so i'll have to catch up :D
---
Thank you!
---
I realise the bounty number is 37 not 43 XD
---
This would be a lot better than what they went with.
---
You don't need an upgrade for that. Those increase your chances of getting additional runes next to the guaranteed one.
---
Looks much better to me right off the bat.
---
This is exactly what I wanted, amazing job, I hope bungee sees this
---
Yes please
---
Imagine if you had to do this across 3 characters. You'd literally be occupied with doing bounties and completing triumphs till year 3.
---
Fuck hunters golden gun on invasions
---
That is all
---
Been there before, it sucks. Well if it helps, forsaken really improves the game. It's kinda sad that i don't feel any desire to play it anymore.
---
Human scum. Players like those are the reason why PvP is dying.
---
Same for titan
---
Ah those seem to be newly added and unsolved on my part. Try looking it up somewhere, maybe it's been solved already
---
agreed!
---
Cursed images.
---
That makes sense
---
Im just gonna assume that if this is true, could this mean i would be able to lets says take my ps4 account and play on pc with it? And vice versa for xbox/pc to w.e i decide to play d2 on? Just maybe cost lets say anywhere between $50-100? This is all hypothetical btw.
---
OMG! Yes! This is what was needed, 100%
---
I hate that Bungie put the pursuits in the director. It is so clumsy.
---
Ya but that shouldnt be the reason to cuck pc players.
---
Ouring theme..nce again the community comes up with something better than the actual devs can.  Seems like a reocc
---
I'm pretty sure it happened to everyone. My wife and I had it. It's not that big a deal anyway, since it's a menagerie boss and you'll kill it at some point either way.
---
We‚Äôll just have to wait and see
---
I'm a developer, and I promise you, the good ones (and Bungie's devs are definitely good ones) care very much about this and put as much time and thought into these things as humanly possible. But they have technical limitations that we don't know about, in addition to the fact that they have different tastes concerning what solution is "better" than another. I guarantee you that a UX designer had a beautiful layout like the one in this image, and the developer had a dozen reasons why it wasn't possible (given time/resource constraints).  
---
This layout makes some assumptions that may just not be feasible. For example, while it may seem obvious to you or me which pursuits are "pinnacles," "synthesizers," "quests," or "bounties," the game engine probably thinks of them all as one kind of thing (or the opposite: something I might think of as a "bounty" might actually be considered a "synthesizer" for an obscure technical reason). There may also be a couple pursuits that don't fit cleanly into any of those categories, so they may have decided it was better not to split them up at all. Or perhaps they have knowledge of planned changes coming down the pipeline and knew that some of this design would no longer make sense in 6 months.  
---
Now, being (constructively) critical is a good thing and I'm not trying to dissuade anyone (esp. the OP) from giving feedback like this, I'm just saying that there's a huge, huge gap between "here's a picture of a beautiful, usable UI" and "here's what we can actually accomplish in a reasonable time."
---
Infinitely better.
---
Ya but bungo would never do this. Way to much of a redesign and lota of bug testing.
---
The best way is to add in a hot key. Simple.
---
Agree to agree, friend
---
This. Needs a hotkey since the move and a UI like above
---
Dude, this is amazing.  This is exactly what we need.  Upvote this to Infinity!!!  I have a few friends who play who seem to struggle with keeping track of all the bounties and now with this new season, there are so many, it is crazy.  So keeping it more organized would really help for those that have issues keeping it all together.
---
buffling how a non Bungie employee does a better job than the guy who "created " the pursuit tab
---
How am I petty here, i just want them to rework the weapon, because right now it‚Äòs no better or more unique than any legendary sniper in a well with luna faction boots or titan barricade.
---
Maybe you are  trolling me though, if that‚Äòs the case i hope you had your fun.
---
I guess i'm not the only one. This probably means that its on Bungie's end, so now we just have to wait until they release a patch or something.
---
Yikes. You‚Äôre a dense one.
---
yeah it looks like the other triumphs are bosses as well.
---
Feels bad. I got this back in S1 along with the Sweep emote and was hoping they'd stay exclusives :(
---
Looking at you Xfinity üòí
---
I use a Titan so that thing can probably wreck with a Rally Barricade
---
Oh yeah
---
That doesnt mean anything when it comes to cross save or cross play stuff
---
I see what u did....Used DIM to 0:06....lol....nice try...
---
Love it!!!
---
Use the search function
---
I think it's in poor taste to offer up stuff from previous seasons.  Folks who were around from the beginning should get to sport cosmetics that D2 younglings can't get.
---
A lot of game developers are honestly excited and happy for other devs. Ghostcrawler Greg Street talks about game releases and amazing games all the time.
---
Well color me stupid, I haven't yet...
---
Rainmaker, spider, running strikes (which also helps complete that grenade launcher quest). Pretty much anything that involves killing things
---
[removed]
---
Even with an SSD, it‚Äôs painfully slow in comparison to the old inventory tab.
---
Because **it is** fucking stupid to gate in game content behind some app? It's not an attack on their response, it's critique against Bungie.
---
You're such a shit-eating fanboy jeez
---
Wtf you just blew my mind that explains it all
---
It's so beautiful
---
Same here. Was like, Hasapiko? I don't even know who you are.
---
It‚Äôs awesome. It destroys adds in the hallway section of the menagerie. If you can line up your shots you can take out a ton of adds in one burst
---
If you‚Äôre asking because you‚Äôre trying access that room. I did it by just loading into Titan and going to it.
---
Ultimately only you can make that decision. 
---
I think Forsaken is worth more than the base game in terms of enjoyment and longevity. Whether or not the annual pass is worth it is more subjective. You should look at what it provides (mostly end game only) and see if that sounds appealing.
---
This is a cool mockup! Thanks for sharing.
---
If anyone has feedback on the pursuits tab, feel free to leave it here. I'll be passing it along to the team.
---
guess what the modifier today is?
---
It's blackout
---
I wonder if destiny was ruined by all the 12 years olds playing it now.
---
Like you.
---
I've gotten at least 4 energy weapons in a row today.
---
It works. Just not powerful drops.
---
Honestly just looked like a exotic version of recluse. Don‚Äôt see how this would take recluse‚Äô spot.
---
this is a much better way of explaining why i dont like when these things are done and then everyone comes to dunk on the company that didnt do it this way.
---
this is amazing, please post on the other reddit
---
I posted this on r/raidsecrets already btw.
---
I think that‚Äôs why: it‚Äôs a year 1 weapon. This season recycled a lot of year 1 loot, between apparently menagerie drops and the bright engrams. It seems a bit lazy and kind of like a slap in the face.
---
It‚Äôs not a new perk, it was destiny 1 but it‚Äôs new to destiny 2 at least
---
I got that exact same role. Ima rest it in gambit to be honest.
---
No buddy, it really wasn‚Äôt because if you hadn‚Äôt noticed Bungie gave no regard to player feedback before the split from Activision. We get that you‚Äôre very smart and very mature but maybe just maybe, and this might be difficult for someone as intelligent as you, laugh. *tips fedora*
---
So you want stunt and miss multi tool to be mostly useless with their pistol/smg counterparts having trash perks that can‚Äôt be changed?
---
Can't tell, vaseline is obscuring the picture.
---
Are you people not aware the devices you play on take actual screenshots? There is no need for this potato quality in 2019.
---
I dislike the new money system they made but the shop looks fuckin slick
---
Thanks you
---
Not the same. LFR reduce mechanics for pugging.
---
Micro transactions, imo, will always suck. But yeah, the UI is sooooooo sweet.
---
Perk wise it‚Äôs better but takes 2 kills to proc instead of 1 and it has to be with that from that weapons as well unlike recluse otherwise I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs beefy recluse.
---
Do you have the Forsaken dlc?
---
fuck yeah embrace death
---
Depending on the upgrades you put in, you can get 1-3 per week
---
Check the Truimphs for the catalyst sections
---
Yes, the new location is hilariously misplaced.  No one cared that it was where it was, now it‚Äôs annoying it‚Äôs been moved.  It is disastrously unorganised, seriously, how did you manage to make it worse?  This amazing mock-up is far superior in every way.
---
Who gives a shit
---
why wouldn‚Äôt these categories be a part of the db entry? FK to a category table or something.
---
Ah, I see. Thanks. I'm kind of worried about wasting runes so I just wanted to make sure that I didn't use them for rewards that wouldn't be powerful.
---
I think they should be allowed to have them, but maybe make exclusive year 1 skins?
---
Ya ik but compared to the popularity of fortnite its small
---
This is correct. This is also PER CHARACTER. I did 1 on my hunter last night, then upgraded my chalice. It went from 0 to 1 on my hunter (as my first was already complete). Switched to my warlock and it showed 2 powerful rewards remaining on the warlock. 
---
So the number of rewards is per character but depends on the upgrades applied.
---
Most likely at weekly reset.
---
Its for flawless, already been posted.
---
BBWWAAAAAAAA BUUUUUUUUUHHHH
---
BWWAAAAA BWAA BUUH BUUUUUUUUH
---
My suggestion is too get the second or third upgrade in the middle section (idk which it is). That way when you finish a run, it refunds you for one of them
---
That depends... Whats fun for you? That really vague. I had fun last night, but if you don't like what I liked, you may hate it.
---
Really can't give helpful advice when I know nothing about you.
---
No, you don't understand, you are leaving Gambit matches because you lost a round, that fucks up games for people in a big way so no one gives a fuck what quest you are doing (who the fuck cares?!) you admitted to doing the #1 thing that fucks up a whole game mode for a lot of people (aside from just being afk) and so we never left the topic of you being an asshole. Do you understand now?
---
That blast radius üëå
---
They should have updated them so you know they are not real year 1. Like the green and blue brooms? I mean I never got lucky enough to get the selfie emote. But I'd take looking like a pleb noob over not having it. 
---
I'm more mad about the catalysts tho. I worked my butt off for those things during the Faction Rallies. And now they just drop....
---
Is Arblast a random drop now?
---
I invade with 11 motes the other day to escape an invader using Golden Gun and wound up getting a 4k.
---
Might be l but I got mine during revelry.
---
Thanks buddy
---
I was playing gambit and some dumbass who had 15 motes invaded the other team he died instantly
---
Good news for Hunters then, that‚Äôs my favorite cloak
---
I don't think so
---
The overall experience is greatly improved by owning Forsaken. 
---
The annual pass mainly adds new reasons to do existing activities. It has a lot of things that are tough to solo, such as a new gambit game mode and some new activity unlock quests that ask you to do special versions of nightfalls, so if you do not like to find groups for things, it may not be for you. It does add a lot of new items.
---
This has been posted at least 50 times.
---
It's no longer possible to purchase CoO or Warmind separately. As of yesterday morning, they are now free with the base game.
---
Yes.
---
Trial m8
---
No one knows. In yesterday's patch there was a note about them being adjusted, but no one has any clue what that means.
---
Oh whale then, disregard my previous statement
---
Yeah, I watched a video on exactly where it's located. But I wouldn't have watched that video without your confirmation on where the forge is and that it's accessible like that, so thanks again.
---
No this was definitely OP can't you tell by the title?
---
That‚Äôs lucky my last exam isn‚Äôt until the 21

You want the truth? Just about every game does it. They‚Äôre just cycling the meta. Make something they know is OP because it gives hype for people who need hype to keep playing. Later, nerf it. Players get bored. They want a ‚Äúbest weapon in the game‚Äù to chase. New OP meta. Rinse, repeat. I guarantee you they‚Äôll over-buff more stuff soon (if they haven‚Äôt already, and we just haven‚Äôt realized), but not a chance it‚Äôs the same stuff they nerfed before.

And the whole new dlc is basically kulve taroth from monster hunter world.lol

[like this? does this come with forsaken and the season pass?](https://m.gamestop.com/product/ps4/season-passes/destiny-2-forsaken-annual-pass/164150?cid=fds_10000777&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;&amp;gclid=eaiaiqobchmi0p7l1prt4givxuonch1zuapgeaqyasabegits_d_bwe)

You have to complete the invitation Quest from Benedict

---
Complete menagerie triumphs, they award 500 each
---

---
R u me

In my experience, the only reason anything is ever OP is to give it hype. Because some people need hype to enjoy a game. From what I can tell, you‚Äôre one of those people. To anyone who wants balance instead of hype, you‚Äôre the reason this game will never be competitive. There‚Äôs two sides to this and it‚Äôs impossible to please both.

Besides, Bungie historically favors your mindset. There‚Äôs always something OP. Just give it a bit, people like you will stop playing in a few weeks because ‚Äúthere‚Äôs nothing to look forward to and no reason to grind.‚Äù Then, they‚Äôll over-buff something, or release something broken, and the grind for that thing starts. This is a cycle that I‚Äôve never seen Destiny stray far from, and honestly, same with most games.

I‚Äôve already spent over100$. 60$ base game (suckered in at launch), 40$ for forsaken and 25$ for annual pass. I like the game clearly but cosmetics/eververse this season are an absolute joke. It is absolutely not a bargain.
---
This is exactly what I wanted. The pursuits tab in the director is stupid.
---
Worlds 2st
---
Ive never completed last wish sooooo
---
Ah yes finally I was wondering about the treeness of a tree
---
Sorry
---
Guess its just an unknown combo then.
---
Huh. Strange I only get those two
---
Had FCF twice. Beloved once but with dogshit roll.
---
Almost have mine done ;\_; ill have it this week finally.
---
Nice. It's my favorite ship. Partially because I know I really had to work to get it
---
So nice to have all the shotguns put away for a while and people actually having to aim.
---
Omfg I didn't even realise. That's great.
---
They need to take inspiration asap. Without any hotkey to get to the pursuits tab in the directory I find it extremely cumbersome to get to and having multiple pages of pursuits makes it harder to find the one that I am trying to find.
---
What platform do you play on?
---
I much prefer the single quest with many requirements
---
It doesnt ban you unless you back out three games in a short amount of time.
---
There is no oof big enough to describe how I feel for math class.
---
bungie needs to see this. last night it took me awhile to find and get used to the new ugly ui
---
Lol you're all wrong! Will post an update...
---
The new pursuits tab has got way too much text that it is quite the eyesore. It also makes it difficult to find which bounties are completed because it just looks so cluttered. Also completing a bounty should shift the bounty below up, instead of the one on the right. Also bounties should be grouped together by type, not by order they've been obtained, because sometimes the weekly bounties are separated too far from the dailies, so you could have your weekly and daily Gambit prime and black armory bounties together and then the following day, all the dailies all shift to the end which is now a new page in most cases so trying to see where you're at with say "complete 7 BA daily bounties" just makes you go back and forth a lot

Momnigul!
---
Take my upvote

I personally enjoyed step by step for Luna's. While it did take a while to get and could be tedious at times, it was more fun and I could focus on one thing at once instead of trying to get multiple different steps done at one time. Even though it only took me around 2.5-3 days to get, it was something for me to do since the end of the season was sort of dry for me and the step by step quest gave me a real challenge while with cluster quests you just get those done over time unless you really want to grind it out quickly.
---
I do like the look of this but at the same time I do like having Pursuits right next to the Map, it makes it easier to swap between the 2 without having a ton of tabs in the options menu (I'm on PS4)
---
Pretty annoying I paid for that utter trash and now it‚Äôs free.
---
They look like they deepfried the old shader icons, but I'll get used to it.
---
Yes. I hate it.
---
That's me regularly playing sniper, and I love it. I'm comfortable enough with my dick size so k/d doesn't matter.
---
Everything
---
I'm getting excited and I've always played on pc lmao.
---
The old bitch of cuba is getting a foot up her ass come september.
---
Pretty sure they did it with gambit prime as well
---
majority of those people sniping are probably bad anyways not to be rude
