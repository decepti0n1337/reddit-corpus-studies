But he said ding three times
---
---
---
Doesn't it start on the first?
---
I've been wanting a reworked west of sunfall 7. Sooo hyped for this season.
---
Shadow keep is released on the 1st but they decided to start the season on the 5th I‚Äôm pretty sure
---
Thought only the raid dropped on the 5th
---
Nice
---
Upvote with envy
---
Maybe the season is the raid and extra things. Not too sure though
---
I hope it's fully unlocked if we masterwork it now
---
That‚Äôs super cool haha
---
That's why all titans is cancer
---
One per day 
---

---
Drop rates increase 9/3
---
Like most of my game, I get 11 defeats and a 0.8 kda while someone on the other team has 44 and a 22 kda. Apparently I exist to get farmed. Quickplay sucks thanks to the lack of skill matchmaking.
---
Sounds like a 90s kid that grew up on chicken run. He eres my upvote
---
You me both just wondering shall I masterworked my crucible reset I didn‚Äôt bother feeling like doing it as I was going to be losing the set but we see
---
Yeah I just got the solstice armor and I want to try to level it up in time. I realize it'll be hard but I want to try to make it happen. Never played crucible or gambit as I turn lvl 50 just this week.
---
He was in the first trailer/preview they released
---
I ask this as a warlock, can titans actually read, ever?
---
EX-TER-MI-NATE!
---
Probably not how it will work. The new armor will be a separate set from what you are currently wearing. It will probably all be either a set drop level 4-6, or drop randomly like every other armor in the game
---
I have played like 1400 hours of this game solo. I've needed lfg for nightfalls and some of the harder exotic quest steps like corrupted etc, but plenty of others have solo'd them. Also no raids for me unfortunately
---
Yeah I was expecting that
---
Rude of you to assume the Warlocks economical status.
---
Yep, that‚Äôs Arc Web already
---
5700xt NON BLOWER VERSION. And 144fps and hertz
---
Thanks for the fast reply! So the boost no longer locks you out of Y1 content?
---
The value of things change over time. It‚Äôs no different here. It‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre getting all of Forsaken and annual pass content anyway, just select stuff. I‚Äôd much rather see a thriving player base if that means players get stuff I paid for for free.
---
ok cool thanks!
---
It would be even better if you don‚Äôt have heavy ammo finder
---
Frickin calculated
---
He's trying to get a valor reset
---
God damn this is legendary
---
Why use full bore when you're past 100 range? 
---
Also pretty much the god roll for it.
---
Well yeah, cause  he‚Äôs dead now :(
---
\&gt; Edit: Just the boots.
---
Get new light and see if you enjoy the game, then buy shadowkeep and if you feel left out of some raids you should get forsaken and the season pass.
---
So you don't main. You switch around.
---
Challenge accepted, thank you for the response! :)
---
~~yay~~
---
You can easily do 40 bounties in a single day. Pick them all up. Tower, dreaming city, spider, 3 per planet.
---
Submit your Guardians to my Instagram, @holcbuster. Thanks!
---
Except for a phalanx shield
---
you mean blade barrage the gamemode?
---
Right, that was his name *before* he became the Risen slayer known as Dredgen Yor
---
Just pick up bounties for the activities you have to complete for the rest of the armor. The 50 will go by real fast and practically complete itself.
---
Thanks my friend
---
Its underwelming in PvP, but it‚Äôs top notch in PvE
---
Isn‚Äôt that just a strike boss
---
I would recommend using Hazard of the Cast with a rampage roll. Go to blind well with some friends and go ham. It's going to get you used to Breakneck. One of the best Autos in the game.
---
Conversely, you could get Valakadyn with Rampage or kill clip and do the same. Valakadyn has quickly become one of my favorites, especially in Crucible.
---
You don't notice 60fps vs 30fps? Are you 12?
---
Put on as high a modifier as possible before it puts someone at or below 540. 
---
Put on extinguish. Put on other detrimental modifiers based on preference and which nightfall it is. 
---
Make sure everyone has a special ammo weapon.
---
It's a Titan legend
---
Bad Juju is fucking amazing you heathen
---
It's what I did purely to avoid any dlc fuckery. I'll just buy Shadowkeep on both as well. Just easier.
---
I guess there are people who like this, good on you. For me it's fucking hideous, the titan and hunter gear is awesome and space themed. Warlock....Crash bandicoot themed? To be fair I think most of the warlock gear is ugly as in D2 though.
---
They could need to be rotated
---
Did you just assume that Dreg‚Äôs gender?
---
Haha nice one. Nothing compared to Gally, bad Juju went in my vault as soon as I got it. Same in D2.
---
Obvious troll is obvious
---
TITAN POWAAAAA
---
Sotp is a lot more enjoyable in a lfg group as well, only 2-3 people need to know the more technical mechanics.
---
Head banging with the boys
---
Yes it is
---
Yes. That‚Äôs how cross platform works.
---
One of my favorite movies
---
Thats what they get for tryna double team with supers...
---
Are you walking around outside... in your... socks? With a weapon that lets people explode? Who are you?
---
I beleive if you buy merch on bungie.net as well, you get a code for the same emblem. Looks like the emblem I have after I bought my warlock hat online.
---
Not me in the photo, but yes... he‚Äôs outside in his socks
---
I found the solution by changing my Browser..
---
What a mad lad.
---
Sorry a pixel gun gets yours in a twist and sorry you were so hurt by my comment that you cane back ALL this time later to insult me, everyone is proud of you.
---
I hate that sight haha, can never use it!
---
My favorite is the burning shrine map. If you run straight to c or a whichever is across. Throw it at the point. You‚Äôll get a bunch of kills
---
Dude it took me 37 too!!! Twinsies!!!
---
Run around with 0 - 5 -10 and see yourself. 
---
Some people only play with 10 mob.
---
Let me give it a try.
---
To my old fireteam: You suck. Only choosing to help me because I was a former clanless punching bag and laughing at me for never completing Vault or Skolas or even a Nightfall because I didn't have friends is literally the worst way to interact with anybody in Destiny. I met one of you a few months ago attempting to run a Prestige Raid and with my mic off I laughed like the Joker at how my new Clan Leader booted your dumb ass for acting like such an elitist bigot. New Clan is great, have fun losers.
---
One Thousand Voices. Death by Scorn. Last Wish Raid. Bounty Hunting like your name is Boba Fett.
---
Feedback submitted. Good luck üòÑ
---
Depends on who that guy is.
---
It's me: Guaranteed to be Fighting Lion
---
It's not me: Thunderlord.
---
Considering you link your accounts to carry over progress I would assume the ban would remain in effect.
---
Trying to do this bullshit with Warlocks or Titans is the worst. The jumping so sensitive and you have just so little control that the slightest bump will launch you off the damn arena. Also, Hunters have amazing DPS potential with their Supers.
---
Ahhh a combination of 2 things I didn't expect to enjoy but in the end did
---
I suggest shoving all the grenades you got up his ass
---
And im out here that never raided in my life :) i aint got that problem
---
&gt;HUGE drops In playerbase
---
It‚Äôs August turning September soon.
---
Think about it.......
---
&gt;! SCHOOL !&lt;
---
Dude i have only had a titan in d2 and went to try and visit xur once when he was up on the cliffs of the edz once on my level 13 warlock and just trying to get up over the crashed space ship stuck in the trees had me raging lol
---
How is this spoilers.
---
Nice spoilers.
---
If they were to add this, it'd take away budget and time from something else. And while sparrow racing might be cool and all, it's not really the main focus of the game. I'd rather take another dungeon or some more strikes over sparrow racing.
---
Arbalest is an okay weapon, It is only really good for Zero hour imo
---
No, one or the other
---
If you're going to repost art that's not yours at least give the source. -Underhill_Desighn
---
Also this is a lazy repost how does it have so many upvotes üòê
---
The other commentor was correct about the Galaxy part. For the green eternal warrior there is a Jade ornament for.
---
there better have been cabal on the field wtf
---
Crucible Pincle sniper rifle.
---
U r a very very very big zero
---
God damn it
---
Thank you
---
Not untill shadowkeep drops and it is made free
---
I have an odd odd feeling there just be at least one we still somehow dunno about.
---
And again and again since I'll be playing on all 3.
---
Revoker, https://www.light.gg/db/items/654608616/revoker/
---
I can't believe you've done this
---
You don't need the pass to get to 750. You only need the pass to access certain activities like Reckoning, Menagerie and Forges.
---
Bring on Armor 2.0!!
---
Yes, you can equip them if you‚Äôre using cross save to play on a gaming platform you don‚Äôt own Forsaken on
---
nah because then it‚Äòs like any other shooter
---
No infact it is the one place warlocks mantel the most consistantly.
---
True.
---
Yes, steam move is on October 1st
---
Oof. An accurate depiction of my relationship with any ledge in the game... and my luck in gambit.
---
Nicccceee
---
Hahaha for what
---
Yes, a while ago
---
Yes this has been found for a long time now
---
have you played the others classes? titans do not need any love they are very strong.
---
No pls dad.... Go get the milk
---
Thanks!
---
Thanks for the recommendation! I'll check it out
---
This is so true
---
F
---
Idk I never played Halo
---
Yup secret room in the annex
---
Just use a shotgun yourself. Stop thinking your above the meta
---
Who pays $60 to play Hunter?
---
I play other classes, but hunters need a pvp buff
---
I do use shotguns but it's not fun to use them. I personally prefer it being where entire lobbies arent using the exact same gun.
---
But he's playing hunter..
---
Well well well, if it aint the invisible cunt
---
I'm just saying from experience as a warlock main
---
I do have a question. How can you check the progress of your bounties?
---
From expirience i can tell you that you can keep a distance, if the situation forces you to go close quarter or the enemy is hiding behind cover. You dont engage, reset the situation. Change location, make them come to you in a place that favors you not them. If you will stand in a place witha a long lane with some range gun i would like to see a shotgun ape be able to rush you down even with  mediocre aim. You need to plan your engagements.
---
Latest drivers are installed, although I'm going to have him check for updates again later today.
---
Is only the ornament or the gun too ?
---
I guess so but range isn‚Äôt that much of an issue on this game haha I guess it doesn‚Äôt have a ‚Äútravel time‚Äù like hammers or sentinel though.
---
I do try moving and getting into a better position but it's usually ruined by another person with a shotgun coming from behind me so I get pinched.
---
it is, Oct 5th
---
This is my favorite weapon, that looks amazing
---
This is already a thing
---
Supers and Heavy should not be in PvP. Change my mind.
---
I actually said this when my mic was on lol I don't think that Hunter was particularly happy lol
---
Metaphorically
---
It's okay, nothing compared to the comic.
---
I would say quite a lot has changed. 
---
Bungie have spent much of year two making sure the game is more broad and then it sounds like year three will be improvements to those additions to make them more enjoyable and rewarding. 
---
I think if you‚Äôre thinking of coming back, as suggested try new light but also be mindful that shadowkeep and it‚Äôs annual pass will be a big portion of what‚Äôs available going forward. 
---
However personally I feel that this year has 100% been worth it with forsaken being very very good and the subsequent seasons bringing a good amount of content at a decent pace. 
---
Overall I feel the quality of the year two content also completely eclipses the year one content.
---
Thanks for the update! I didn't know.
---
I love seeing Hunters getting rekt by my fellow Warlocks. That was beautiful!
---
Bungie aren‚Äôt in the habit of revealing raid armour.
---
O MG
---
I would pay good money for this
---
Fastest hand in the west... Oh, you mean with a gun?
---
If I ever submit mine (depending on the class), could you make it with a super? Dosen't matter which one, I just think it would be cool. 
---
Also, is there any prices? Simply asking, no r/choosingbeggars please
---
My guess is that because they're making it easier to get, they're gonba nerf it or at least berf Spike Grenades so thar it's no longer a top tier PvE weapon. It's supposed to be used in the Crucible
---
I'm so confused? What typo?
---
Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate?
---
Pretty sure they said they are nerfing the grind
---
BOT
---
so-so crucible, but good in PvE
---
Hahaha honestly, while i have the gun and use it when we really need to win it‚Äôs a tad scummy, just SO easy to get kills, main reason I dont want everyone to have it
---
Hmm, well  at least learning a name of it was a start, but we can only hope that maybe a version of it will go public.
---
Makes Xol's drowning quote a bit more problematic though... But I suppose no less accurate.
---
Bigger maps and lower range on blast furnace would put scouts in a good spot.
---
Why does your FOV look so high compared to the max on PC?
---
I agree that you need to earn a PINNACLE weapon but the problem is that most people just cheese the steps anyway.
---
You have it easy it took me 38 runs
---
lol "oh whiny babies are the worst! They ruin my gayme"
---
\*proceeds to cry and cry and cry because now other people can have his virtual pixels too\*
---
Calm down. Stop crying. How about this... Let other people have access to the gun and you can post on all your social media accounts that you got it before the quest changed so everyone will know you are cool and just the greatest?
---
There, problem solved.
---
lmaooo
---
Oh I love this! I dont have a proper set though.. hmm.
---
naw it would just take skill to use them and not have a crutch free 3-6 kills 3 different time per match..
---
Yeah it's a lot of fun running flawless raids
---
Thanks
---
What should I do with vendor rewards? Save them for Shadowkeep or redeem them now (LL ~320) or at a different LL?
---
im sure you're aware but all you gotta do is touch the boss once and it will count towards boss kills if someone else gets the kill .
---
I would assume so
---
They r expecting cross play to go live in 1.5 hrs
---
Ha HAHAHAHAHAHAA I GET SO PISSED. Like WTF
---
Lol wtf is with the down voted here.
---
Pretty sure there's already footsteps for people that are ulting
---
Holy shit people really didn't like that.. üò≠
---
What the fuck is that cannon?!?!?!?!?
---
Oooh shit! A rat!
---
Ni!
---
 I was looking a videos on YouTube and I saw most of the Ults have elemental steps but not Golden Gun. I could be wrong though.
---
I finished my Warlock last night... I‚Äôve got a long way to go to hit my Titan... here‚Äôs hoping.
---
My dad says I'm to young yo watch it .mom says fuck that well skip the nudity . It's a very....intriguing show
---
repost
---
Anyone else think the hunter is really underpowered? I feel like I‚Äôm gonna get a lot of hateful responses but hear me out, Titans and warlocks both have actually useful class ability‚Äôs, the healing rift, and the barrier. Meanwhile all the hunter has is a dodging ability which can be helpful in few situations. We are also stuck with melee supers instead of ranged supers. Gunslinger is the only super I‚Äôd consistently use, that‚Äôs just my play style though. I also feel like you can kill hunters using their super in crucible much easier than the other classes. 
---
Maybe I‚Äôm just being irrational because I haven‚Äôt played much titan or warlock, the only experiences I‚Äôve had with them are from crucible and strikes. 
---
Please respect my opinion and inform me if you think I‚Äôm wrong
---
you mean dubious volley?
---
Rose with amethyst veil most likely
---
The better question is how do you have a key magnet?
---
Rose, you get it from the lumina quest.
---
Small indie company btw
---
Do you use DIM or Ishtar? It does it to me sometimes when I transfer stacks from/to the vault.
---
Max once then used or pulled from vault
---
only real OGs remember when HIVE ABOMINATION was actually named Phogoth hats off to you good sir
---
Agreed
---
Catalyst - something, something unsalted butter.
---
No problem! glad to hear it worked :)
---
But how sick are those Minotaur things on the Titan‚Äôs back?!
---
*warmind lol autocorrect
---
Yes, you can play your PS4 stuff on Battle.net until October 1st at which point we all move to steam
---
HOWEVER...if you're going from console to PC today, you can't activate cross-save until you've linked BNET to Steam
---
this is a game grumps bit isnt it
---
refresh and try again?
---
It's... From Monty Python... Where the idea of the emote came from
---
As long as you don't count to three...
---
Tried this, now I just have 20 tabs with the same error.
---
Any of them tbh. I got through Normal Leviathan and Last Wish (LW was basically all cheese). I haven't done the other 2 Raid Lairs, Heroic Leviathan or Lairs, Scourge, or Crown of Sorrow.
---
I work during the day, but I'm off every evening. I'm not always on playing D2 so it's not always, but I am. Just have a hard time "taking the dive" into teams and being communicative haha.
---
You get both.  The Fox, and this ornament.
---
Lol

https://www.bungie.net/7/en/CrossSave
---
 
---
Scroll down to see the FAQ
---
I would pay any amount of silver for that
---
Kade
---
It will happen automatically. 
---
You can safely buy the stuff on BNET even after you've linked your accounts to Steam
---
I eventually got through
---
Basically cross play allows you to select one save file as your master save. 
---
If you log on to bungie and select your ps4 profile then you will access those characters no matter what you sign into. 
---
So when you sign onto your Xbox and load, you will see your ps4 characters to choose from and have access to whatever content you own on Xbox.
---
With Cross Saves, Shadowkeep, Steam release. Alot of changes are coming.
---
I would think people are testing out the waters before making a move. Or maybe transfer their main account, and create a sub account for another platform idk.
---
Most of it is probably players trying to upgrade their solstice armors. Or Veterans/Returners who haven't played since pre-forsaken, when triumphs and achievement points didn't exist.
---
Ughhhh
---
The only way would be to set your PS4 guardians as your main cross-save account.
---
But then you can't use your PC guardians unless you deactivate cross-save
---
It seems if I try to link more than 2 accts it just unlinks one of the others and wont let me move on to the next step
---
What expansions do you have on the BNET account?
---
Which accounts ?
---
N o
---
Oh wtf, sorry idk how that happened
---
No, you can still solo it in 15 minutes today. Many destiny youtubers have gone back and done it.
---
 It was probably a variation of this meme but not this one cause I just made this one this morning.
---
I‚Äôm just confused as to what game you‚Äôre playing that you actually just called well of radiance niche. Titans are worthless in endgame dude.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve restarted my pc and still get the same error
---
Steam, PSN, and Xbone. My battle.net always stays linked but the other three keep swapping out as I link another
---
Thankyou everyone!
---
You mean the ass where titan marks go? Not a stretch to have been unsure.
---
More sleepless night lol
---
Seems something to do with the steam battle net migration not sure as I don't play on pc . Wait it out or follow the seperate steam migration process posted yesterday first.
---
I dont think cross play is ever coming, but I dream of it too
---
I won‚Äôt sleep until I have talked to Bungie personally
---
Well yea restarting your PC isn't going to fix a server error on Bungie's end lol
---
haha yea its like a spikey unicorn of death
---
They are cool, but as a Warlock main, I gotta represent with extreme bias! lol
---
Yes you will have to buy again for pc. Sorry bro.
---
It's obviously Petra, Mara Sov and my Titan
---
RIP, what about the playing on both platforms tho?
---
You are indeed correct lmao
---
Damn u ugly
---
Yeah both platforms you can play on. Obviously only Xbox will have all your bought dlc
---
Having a hard time dealing with the fact that only Highlander is straight evil but I'm only up to the Christian concert so maybe I'll see an actual evil character no him.
---
Cat girls confirmed someone page Elon.
---
Dziƒôki za szczero≈õƒá
---
Petition to actually add this as bottom tree stormcaller melee , called Repulsive Charge, and actually have a warlock melee that does something other than the same thing as every other tree besides the middle trees
---
Ok, I might refund and re purchase on PC but how would that work. Bc I would have shadowkeep gear on PC but not be able to play?
---
Yeah, reset next week is the cutoff for getting the legendary sets. You can complete the masterwork objectives later though.
---
I‚Äôve been playing PC for a while, so I‚Äôm pretty good with mouse &amp; keyboard
---
Not sure about that. Although I‚Äôm pretty sure when you buy any dlc or anything on Xbox store it said non refundable. You will have to check it out.
---
Why thank you
---
Maaan, isn't Fear Of Missing Out, just such a wonderful wholesome experience??
---
Thanks guys!
---
Are you suggesting coconuts migrate!?
---
Us hunter main aren't the real problem, Bottom tree OEM striker titans are.
---
Yeah, I like the concept of the exotics that have paired legendaries, but hopefully if they do more they make at least one of the pair a special.
---
wow
---
Nope you can still Play Switched today and Could Play like normal. 
---
It‚Äôs only a Step to verify which Account you wanna transfer the aktual transfer happens later
---
ok
---
I think that xbox has a policy where you cna refund preorders up until like a day or something until it comes out. Idk I'll check it out.
---
Thanks for the help man
---
Www.bungie.net/crosssave
---
r/Unexpectedjojo
---
No worries. Eyes up Guardian.
---
300, cross save means you pick one account and that is THE account for all platforms. Progress on one platform is progress on all. (Not sure about Stadia yet but xbone, PS4, and PC for sure)
---
Noe I have to choose between better platform or where my friends are
---
Oh, thanks a lot!
---
I loved that and hated it all at once.
---
You have to do the storyline in the jokers wild season
---
The player got credit for the kill even though he wasnt the one who killed him. That's a bug
---
You want to start over? I can't translate what you said into words.
---
Im also with dregden 100% on my hunter main, but my titan is a S N I T C H
---
It‚Äôs a hard choice. I will stick with Xbox for now as my pc is in need of a few upgrades before it will run D2 without stuttering in combat.
---
Yeh. I dont know. It's a hard choice.
---
Still doable without Forsaken, I‚Äôm almost done with my Warlock who didn‚Äôt even touch Forsaken at all yet.
---
Good luck buddy
---
If you use the new shell and remote from shadowkeep preorder (deluxe edition I think?) You can have a eris' rock shell and a eris' rock emote.
---
When there's one left I go into Jason Voorhees mode. I will either get my sword or walk towards them ready to smack him to death. No sprinting... Just a slow walk... They try to shoot me with their pea shooters, but I keep walking. Closer and closer. They try to melee me, I just stand there and take it... Let him run some more. It's like a game of cat and mouse. And then...I end him. 
---
Man this sounded a lot cooler in my head. Now I just sound like a psychopath.
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat for PvP and just aim for fun rather than being super competitive in QuickPlay.
---
Interesting but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôd use the ghost shell as the rock placeholder even if it was equipped
---
Just beautiful
---
Hey man fuck the haters.  Elitist pricks are the majority of PC population. Don't worry bout the downvotes

---
No,it ends on the 27th the extension was simply for moments of triumph not the solstice event.
---
It's cuz warlock jumps are shit (Warlock and Hunter player here). Somehow, the least useful PvE class (Titan, sry) has the best float jumps.
---
Same here, except its the only one im doing )
---
What are you, some kind of hunter-hating Attunement of Flame or Code of the Juggernaut OEM meta piece of crap? Hunters aren‚Äôt the problem.

Don't know where else to ask, new to Reddit. Does anyone know if you can entered Shattered Throne this week? I am trying to complete my Solstice masterwork objectives and the portal is not open. Are there any prerequisites to enter? Any help is greatly appreciated.

Yeah that's true but idk about getting used to playing with a mouse and keyboard. I want to play on PC but I feel like if I play with a Controller I'm just gonna get wrecked lol

They can also just ‚Äú/join [Your Battletag]‚Äù without the [] &amp; ‚Äú‚Äù

Lol there is no ‚Äúthick and thin‚Äù for you guys it‚Äôs an easy road
---
 Moments of Triumph was extended, not Solstice.
---
Thanks bud
---
That would piss me right tf off, my suggestion would be reinstall, but wait n see if anyone else has somthing more direct
---
Thanks, I won‚Äôt
---
Riskrunner is most definitely one of the most underrated exotics for pve activities. My personal favorite use is in the Zero Hour mission because of all the fallen that shoot arc. If you have 3 people running it the entire mission is a breeze.
