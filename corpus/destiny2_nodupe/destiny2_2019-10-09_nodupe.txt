No heroic taken blights are random when there is enough guardians around

Former Sherpa here.  I’ve run raids with people who don’t shut up, and others who don’t say a word.  You don’t need to talk if you don’t want to.  Just go in with a positive attitude, a willingness to learn, and the rest will fall into place.

Nah I ain’t no bitch 6,2 250? Must be a little obese

It took me a bit to figure it out too. I wish they would have made that a little more obvious with the changes. Oh well.

Wobbuffet uses 'counter'

Lord Beerus chubby?

Little fuckers deserved it...

Hmmm not sure then

Task failed successfully.

You can change your name for free, so you see some creative things
---
tried that. even reset my game and it still wont show
---
They freak me out so they deserved to die.... change my mind.
---
I'm currently running riskrunner and can confirm the accuracy of this post.
---
They're fucking gross as shit apparently splash damage doesn't do anything to em so I basically wasted an entire mag on em
---
1 no 2 only in new ones 3 yes
---
Can tell lol
---
I've played 45 hours and have gotten 7 exotic drops including a fated and the one from level 25 or whatever, my friend has played 20 hours and got it as like his second drop
---
Once it’s full( you have to fill the last rank) when you haves over an activity like crucible if you maxed valor it will say “x” to reset valor
---
Isn't he trapped in the infinite forest? I thought that if he leaves it, one of the minds he killed will reform and then we all die
---
At least you have terrible aim, so some of them might have managed to get away and hide in time #WormsArePeopleToo
---
How did you get it so smooth?
---
It actually amazes that people think he's dead serious about everything
---
You have to get a triumph seal
---
Not showing up for my hunter either.  Been driving me crazy for days!  I hope it gets fixed, and soon!   :|

There is a story......

Submit this to @destinynames

Imagine going to a Destiny 2 fan area and telling everyone that in your opinion you don't like the thing they like. This is going to go well.
---
True.
---
Yes yes, my Dreadnought is here,  but where is the Leviathan? And what about me son Crota? Still on Earth's Moon or has he Ascended to the afterlife?
---
If someone buys me shadowkeep mi carrying u all with some ppl ;v
---
How do you unlock the "monte carlo" quest or is it a random drop?

I just played this guy in pvp and got my ass handed to me

This is brilliant...

changes daily.
---
Bungie changed it so you can only do one forge at a time, it switches every day. Not sure why seems dumb to me.
---

Funny. I posted something about wanting to turn nightfall bosses in to vanity pets that award the aura instead of banners. The top comment was ‘no, this isn’t wow.’ Barber NPC is literally from WoW. Next you’ll be wanting a Transmutation NPC as well to change the appearance of any armour piece into any other armour piece (I know this sounds like sarcasm but I’ve seen a lot of posts recently wanting this function but not the NPC). 
---
Be careful what you wish for.
---
Oh dang idk then. I’ll check in a bit I might be in the same boat
---
Did you bother going through the campaigns or did you simply jump into the middle of the game expecting the same experience as the people who have actually played through the story content?
---
Yeah, the RNG is questionable a lot of the time. 
---
Heres an F for your troubles.
---
Eververse gear, dupe ships and sparrows, eververse bounties
---
The surface? In all honesty it isn’t all that smooth. Maybe the picture quality makes it look that way. It’s rather rough right now, due to the fact that the layers form a sort of grain. I used a disc sander to remove the remains of the support, but I haven’t done anything else yet.
---
You have quests to unlock each one in series. I think you can only fast travel to volunder but you can manually travel to whichever, granted you’ve done the quests that is
---
Venezuela?
---
Shite.
---
I did that but I didnt get it
---
Vuvuzuela sorry
---
Necrochasm
---
Oh whoops should have clarified that I meant on the reddit not in the game
---
Thats weird... i just completed a nightfall but that was last season. Did you do it with a friend?
---
Get to legendary, and then complete that level. Its not for the faint of heart.
---
Hahahaha
---
The easiest of them all is Dredgen the gambit one

Ah, I see. I was afraid I’d have to stoop to socialism to grind xp, thank god for typos

These things will literally burrow into a Hive and slowly kill them if they don’t kill others. I am liberating a future Hive of this bloodlust.

I love this old school reference! Now I have Jungle Book songs stuck in my head
---
wait till you see some  over the top  name like somethin involving gas chambers/hitler or   some other event lol
---
Like local/team chat? I've never seen anyone say anything in there.
---
Guess nobody knows how good the risk runner really is lol
---
No worries dude, hope you enjoy it. Its a real fun weapon to use.
---
Can I have my sibling play our account on ps4, and me play the same account on pc at the same time?
---
Hold up
---
Risk runner is no ordinary gun
---
Playing destiny 2 base content on steam and having a great time in pvp crucible. My question is what do I need to purchase to get majority if not all of the content and get me up to speed? Is it shadow keep or something else? Thanks in advance
---
I agree that fusions are out of hand tho.
---
does it work for Zhan?
---
-Enemies can only have 1 debuff.  
---
-Players can only have 1 buff.
---
-Weapon perks are applied seperately.
---
-Celestial nighthawk is insane dps.  
---
-Your weapons choices are in the current Meta for most encounters, but there is variants.  I suggest finding Izanagi's Burden as well, but nit necessary.
---
-Nighthawk I use on final bosses, but often its not required and the utility of tether is more appropriate.  This is a call you will make or your team will help you make.
---
-Tractor cannon is a nice, easy debuff option (heavy exotic)
---
-Weve used hunter void middle tree melee (shattering strike) often.  It also applies a debuff which im fairly sure is the same as titan melting point, but I find it harder to pull off.
---
-You are raid ready right now, find a group!  There is nothing better in Destiny than raiding.
---
It’s not in my quest tab and it’s not in my post lol I am fucked
---
I don’t know, that’s something that needs to be tested but I normally melt him anyway.
---
REALLY!!!! So your telling me, thatthe gun that I’ve had for four weeks can destroy through actual immune shields??
---
Challenge: can you make it heroic before the blueberries beat it? CAN YOU!?
---
Just read on another post about it. It says exit to character screen then load back in. Also try on other characters.
---
so whats in this u can tell us now
---
i am currently running the arms dealer for an exotic quest. ngl pretty irritating lol. found the cheese though sooo a win?
---
I know. It has this cool Arc Lighting AOE ability but I ended up getting that Multi-Tool gun literally like 5 minutes later which ended up being the better gun.
---
Not destroy, ignore its basically an armor piercing round that actually punches through a lot of stuff.
---
The names have significantly increased in quality and comedy since were on steam now
---
No problem man. Good luck on getting the essence to drop. It's a bloody great feeling shotgun. I'm now grinding out the essence for the god roll to drop.
---
I've done Red War and the postmaster doesn't have anything for me
---
No they kinda worked the campaign. BUT the risk runner can now be obtained from a relatively easy quest from banshee
---
But why don’t you matchmake
---
Cool, I just use celestial, Izanagi’s, and swarm with spike(until I get a love and death gl with spike and full court)
---
2 words: vex milk
---
Oh ok yeah that is a better swap
---
Are you by chance running iCue for Corsair products
---
Not sure if good enough to share with other guardians but amused at nabbing the two kills when I was only expecting one bloke
---
-signed a blueberry since forsaken
---
Monte Carlo
---
Hi, do I need to play Gambit or Crucible in this game ?
---
Yes pinnacle weapons stay and will be in collections, but I would be cautious with how the servers are acting
---
For my mouse. That’s it. Are you telling me that’s what’s causing it to go from 150+ FPS to 30 or less for a solid minute or two then back up?
---
I think u are referring to  its low power level of 791 being replaced right by 1 that is higher right. If u didn't know, u can click on the weapon and under the perks, there's the option to infuse (by sacrificing another higher power gun) and upgrade it's light level using an upgrade module from banshee. Just keep the gun until ur 900+ before upgrading it. 
---
PS don't discredit how insane this gun is in pve
---
So do you not ever stop by the tower to pick up bounties? Not even the weekly ones?
---
I presume you must visit the tower at some point throughout the week if you give a shit at all about powerful rewards. Pick them up at that point.
---
If you have as many resources as you suggest you do, then you could easily sick on a decent stack of modules. At least as many as you'd need until you feel like unenthusiasticly visiting the tower.
---
My point isn't as much about the needlessness of the modules. Although I understand it to be yours. Even then, I would, maybe like yourself, be satisfied with infusion just costing as much as a module would, but without the intermediate.
---
My point is about the sheer insignificance of this issue. Come on, there has to be more urgent, more significant issues with the game that deserves to be discussed more than this.
---
Anyways, I think you're complaints are legitimate. Despite how I may come across.
---
You don’t have to play either. However they are both great sources of gear and powerful drops to level up. Also fun
---
Yea, I got the Pain &amp; Gain quest and I'm 90% complete with the catalyst stuff but I still wanted to see if I could get the other exotics from the campaign. I'm new to D2 but I played D1 and back then Xur sold the 3 of Coins that made exotic hunting easy, now I don't really know how or where to get exotics beside the Nightfall. So how does one get exotics now?
---
What about the progress because i dont have those guns yet will all my progress reset
---
Actually haven't seen any yet
---
Uninstall it and see if that doesn’t improve your FPS. I ran into an issue with an update last month and rolling it back to 3.16 worked.
---
Might lose the progress
---
give them some privacy, creep
---
If you're having fun, then... No?
---
old player that hasn’t played since the first DLC came out until now , here . how do you obtain the Riskrunner again ?
---
Shadowkeep is pretty much all of the current content. With forsaken you get a campaign and the 3 raids from last year, which whilst fun, don’t give you powerful drops like the Shadowkeep stuff does
---
Is there any quest item from shadowkeep in the tab? What was the last quest step you did if you can remember. I know during the story you have to do the scarlet keep strike from the map tab before you head into that mission
---
They Actually Gave away The base game, Curse Of Osiris, Warmind and many Forsaken Content Pieces like gambit and The menagerie and forges. New Players also can access all planets and get all year 1 Exotics. A little more then $60 but I get your point.
---
Collections has set rolls. You could pull 100 out and they will be exactly the same.
---
I think there is a possibility that it could roll as arc, but it would have to be a random drop from the world or hope that xur sells it.
---
a what
---
Access to all planets doesn’t mean they can fully use them though. For instance the moon. Thanks for seeing what I mean tho.
---
My favorite thus far was two guys standing next to Shaxx in the Tower stoically.
---
Their names?
---
Shaxx’s Left Nut and Shaxx’s Right Nut.
---
The best $13.45 ever spent.
---
Are you supposed to be able to change your name as you want? When I do it I can’t sign in until I change back to my original name..
---
Yep, new players probly werent spending enought money :-/ Its damn nice move, considering that it has increased droprate of exit items :D
---
No
---
Like when you open your characer, have "edit look" or just "edit" maybe off to the left. Under the emblem or something. Or add it to settings. Under "helmet" have "edit character appearance"  just... SOMETHING.
---
An Isekai anime is when the main character dies and gets resurrected to a world in which they must become a hero to save it.
---
Ahhh that’s disappointing and frustrating to hear.  But thank you for the answer and helping me regain my sanity.  
---
I am trying to find an Arc helmet as, and correct me if I’m wrong, there is no longer a “heavy ammo finder” perk which means I need “machine gun ammo finder” which is only available to Arc helmets?
---
With the new armour I’ve gone through a few strikes with zero heavy drops, old armour I had a couple pieces with Heavy Ammo Finder.
---
There’s also a lore tab of someone being bitten by a snake (native to the Chile area) right outside the wall
---
If one of the moons leaves orbit and is going to impact a planet, can we name it Jotunn? I know its not as strong an impact as the gun in game but i feel its as close as we can get
---
uture war cult F emblem be like
---
Get it done Bungie. Simple add another node for shuffled game modes.
---
It's honestly baffling to me that the game has shit like a companion app for LFG and limited use items for guided game matchmaking rather than a simple recruiting chat like Warframe
---
Thanks, Banshee
---
If hey do implement this, I’d imagine they’d make it so you can only change your appearance but not race, to keep it somewhat believable. I’ve always wanted ti change from an exo to a human, but I’d be fine with just making my exo look better. Still completely on board, though.
---
🙏🙏🙏
---
I'm still trying to learn how it all works. It's super confusing even for people who have played since launch. I doubt they would get rid of heavy ammo finder. It may just be way harder to get now? Honestly this whole new system confuses the hell out of me.
---
Hmm thats probly because u didnt finish story chain before destiny was reworked. Bungie announced that all unfinished somtory chains would b reseted and that what happend to u mate
---
&gt;Shadow
---
Some thrall caught shoplifting. Gotta uphold the mall law.
---
Great find. Thanks, Banshee.
---
Because shazx is on top.
---
Nice I like that recommendation, I may give the viest a shot to free up an exotic slot for a more impactful weapon.
---
That’s odd usually how the black armory starts is you talk to ada and she tells you to help reignite the forge. She give you a purple blueprint for machine gun which is the quest. Once you make the gun then you can buy other blueprints.
---
r/destinythegame
---
Anthem was like that week 4.
---
Same applies to weapons. Only way to level up power level is drops but you can infuse your higher level gear into lower level to level it up. Afaik no way to actually increase stats on gear besides mods
---
Lol it's easy when you have someone above to tell you where Trevor is only two people are needed to do the maze
---
Go to the Moon.
---
What's a try-harris?
---
D1 veteran.  Confuses the hell out of me too.  I’ve found some useful charts going over all the possible mods but I can’t find a general “heavy ammo finder” mod anywhere.  Just ammo finder mods for one specific weapon. 
---
Don’t get me wrong, I really enjoy the new concept of being able to fully customize our armour to our own specific play styles without having to hope for good rolls, as well as being able to use armour that we think looks good....but damn I could really use a good book or guide for this new system.
---
This really is true.. coming from the perspective of someone disabled with severe ptsd and anxiety along with other illnesses, being a disabled gamer in destiny really stresses me out with the need for pre built fire teams.. I end up just missing out on a lot of weapons. 
---
Thanks for posting this opinion it’s nice to see others have noticed the same thing.  I don’t want them to water anything down.. I understand the masses want the really big challenge so that’s fine..
---
Just wish the community could be a little bit more accommodating I guess? And the idea of new players getting match made with other like minded new players as an option could be cool. 
---
Goodluck guardian.
---
I have a feeling they're set rolls no mature the source. 
---
Geomag Stabilisers have Arc
---
Sunbracers have Solar
---
Contraverse Holds have Void
---
Gateway Artists have Arc
---
From these I assumed that the roll is based on which subclass the exotic is aimed towards and/or the lore behind the piece. 
---
Others should check theirs and get confirmation on this?
---
Not to be crass, but I wouldn’t play Anthem even if it were free.
---
Ran into him today in the tangled shore and he accepted my chest bump
---
On PC, I'll occasionally get this glitch. The game will start fine, but as soon as I load into a destination the screen goes black and then my monitor says: No Input Detected.
---
All you need is some motivation! You're already 16.6% of the way there... ACTIVATE GRIND!
---
Or you could do it the old way, transfer all to vault, delete character and then play for few days that will feel like centuries until you’ve leveled enough to re-equip the gear.
---
Safe to dismantle all mods from your inventory.
---
Read the description and the. Read my progress. Numbers are different.
---
Thanks for the input. My Stadia preorder comes with the full collection, but I don't want to wait that long to play, so Shadowkeep it is for now!
---
Not every drop, but I’ve had a fair few drop this season. Those god roll videos will be out of date since the armor system changed recently (to allow you to slot mods into the armor to get the perks you want). If you look at the seasonal artefact it’ll have a bunch of armor perks you can unlock
---
Hmm, it may be a bug then? It’s supposed to increase the power level of the gun you infused it into
---
You're saying it's hate and toxicity but it's really you just being bad and refusing to learn
---
Mine said nothing, it just played as per usual. I checked my internet and everything, couldn’t find anything that would result in the blank screen. 
---
I’ve been able to play a few other matches without any issues, but it’s still kinda frustrating.
---
Yes! I swear I was able to do that earlier
---
Universal ornaments are kind of like your transmute npc thing
---
Its ok we live and learn
---
Hmm, I'm not sure about Legendary Shaders, but you can diamante gambit drops for Rare Shaders.
---
Any of the new vex armor is doing that for me today
---
Alright it will end in duty I don’t wanna put it on Reddit
---
Illuminati Confirmed.
---
I’ll send you one in a little it will end in duty
---
If you get it would you mind gamesharing me it? I could buy you like a $10 gift card if you do?
---
Ohh I get it the videos are outdated because of the new armor system right? So now it uses the new armor type and the energy it has. Thank you very much!
---
It's the one that's 35 deluxe is 60
---
I would get shadowkeep digital deluxe, and wait for the complete collection from stadia. That way, you get access to everything for at least a year and it’s only like 50 bucks
---
Proof that hunters are master class
---
As one who sucks at pvp, thank you for carrying the team! I really appreciate it! &lt;3
---
yeah, that makes way more sense. After not playing for a few days, I had a lot of planets with the gold circle on the outside of them while in the destinations menu and realized that I finally had some of those challenges. It finally got me that last check box!
---
I don't have it unlocked, though
---
I'm 910 and I got it down to a third of its health before it despawned. Soon as I can get some additional firepower I'll have 1/4 for that triumph.
---
You also have the loot itself from the raid encounters and prime engrams. Also I'm sure once the highest level nightmare hints come out they will rewar dponnacle gear as well. Also the artifact will have you higher than 960 before your core light is actually maxed. 
---
Bit of an overreaction
---
Dunemarcher
---
Thank you new players for not making me feel like a new player as a destiny year 1 and 2 player
---
So what you're saying is, dlc do not carry over with cross-save accounts? That sounds incredibly stupid. Well thats my excitement for playing D2 on pc gone down the drain.
---
Stay alive
---
Already at the soft cap of 900, just wondering because my friends are hardcore and have the DLCs so I’m wondering if they along with myself have an incentive to play it, but apparently that’s not the case. Kinda sucks for the free players.
---
Did robot chicken redo this scene or what?
---
Take a break from destiny. Play some other games, and when you start feeling like you miss it go back. It happens alot when you play one game for too long, switch it up every once in a while and you can keep having fun with every game you have instead of burning yourself out of the game and giving up on it
---
While we're on the topic of these weapons, isn't the CoO pulse rifle a precursor to the Stranger's rifle? Would this rifle from the invasions then be a successor to our precursor (so a middle ground between CoO and Stranger) or a successor to the Stranger's? 
---
..or maybe it's just a reskin and I'm thinking about this too much.
---
There needs to be a .od or something that increases the threshold for the weakened state because the enemies are so low that you might aswell keep shooting them.
---
Yes and no, you could buy them with the currency but today its Alkane Dust, Simulation Seeds, and Seraphite. Which I could instead take to Titan, Mercury, and Mars to buy armor/weapons or farm for general loot legendaries. Your comment is kind of missing the entire point of this post.
---
Universal ornaments would be nice. Fairly unique too. I’d expect some sort of extra requirement like item has to have been masterworked to be available as an ornament or something. Having a ‘barber’ NPC is literally a WoW thing. First introduced in Wrath of the Lich king and transmog was introduced in cataclysm as a way of changed the look of any gear into gear of a similar type.
---
what’s that emblem
---
Yes since making the switch I've been having much more success with jade. I'm pretty slow deliberate player so I wasn't really utilizing the speed boost mida gave me anyway.
---
eciN
---
The three headshot kill is very nice.
---
I can’t even seem to find a path too any of them
---
IIRC, it should just be the Earth world quest, but I may be wrong
---
Yikes! That’s a bummer. I just started that quest and it looks like a grind.
---
Found the Titan
---
Campaigns are available, just viewed as old content. You can get the step to start campaign quests from one of the npcs at the tower. Otherwise do whatever you enjoy! If you have yellow quests you can get exotics from completing all the steps, play strikes, nightfall, checkout the crucible. Lots of opportunities!
---
Before today's patch only the head pieces were doing that, for me. I guess they broke it for all of the pieces now.
---
Apart from all the Weapon and Class buffs and nerfs, 
---
The Armour system has been revamped to allow almost complete customisation, no more random mod rolls on armour. You can add the mods you need, and armour ornaments you've unlocked can be applied to any Legendary piece. 
---
Weapons still have random rolls and 1 mod slot. 
---
The addition of Finishers, like from Doom 4. Once you've upgrade the Seasonal Artificial enough, you can add Mods that give heavy ammo upon using Finishers (at the cost of some super energy).
---
Obviously story missions and exotics. 
---
The Seasonal Artificial, which allows the unlocking of specific mods, too many to explain. 
---
Season Rewards. You can Season Ranks from any XP gain, which give set rewards, like materials, weapons, amour, exotics, permanent buffs, and so on. Up to LVL 100.
---
And so on!
---
I found one on the companion app. Thanks
---
i feel you the grind was fun for me and doing it with friends but its just tiring now
---
Working as intended I see.
---
Peregrine Greaves. Enough said
---
Oh you bad, bad man...
---
Where is this?
---
Well of radiance/ Middle tree solar class. 
---
I would use the Arc middle tree or nova bomb that doesn't have little seekers. 
---
I'm a hunter main, so I can never remember what your supers are called.
---
U can redo them by hitting up Amanda Holiday in the tower (open up the map and she is the only character on the right side of it)
---
Select it From the map, it’s like a strike now
---
You.. you monster
---
I use Mid Voidwalker
---
Oh boy that happens all the time.
---
Also for some reason i can't finish if my magazine is empty?!
---
Now the question becomes if I should level to 45 to get the machine gun
---
Yes
---
Tower hangar if you climb the pipes. It’s for the Leviathans breath which isn’t released, the door in there is open now so they locked it. You can glitch in though.
---
r/fireteams
---
Well I mean do you really have a choice? Are you going to stop playing the game now or what? Because if you keep playing you obviously went eventually get to 45 anyway
---
Happy Cake Day TCR624! The only dare you ever want to take is the dare to be all that you can be.
---
Looks like antiope-d which means this video is from year 1 of D2. Nice video.
---
Oryx is a trans icon, we stan a Taken King!
---
Dumb question - what is the "Shadow" under his name? Tons of players have this, I can't figure out what it is.
---
And yes the machine gun is pretty dope, just run out of billets so quick because fire rates is crazy fast
---
I think part of the problem is that the different chat channels don't automatically opt you in. You can set it that way, but its not the default.
---
I expected Clash too I was really surprised by the BFG only mode.
---
After reading this post, I get the string feeling you have actually played much of any of the expansion before writing this. 
---
You should legitimately go and play the the story and experience more than just a few rounds of crucible (which by the way, the recluse and one eyed mask may be annoying but it's hardly all that's out there, and it's far from unbeatable. That more or less sounds like a git gud complaint) before throwing salt.
---
That being said, enjoy your break. I'm looking forward to seeing what the mysterious construction project in the tower turns into, I know, how dare they add something that might be a big story element just to keep us guessing about it. (Don't worry, those of us who bought it to actually play it will let you know what the big mystery is.)
---
They nerfed it in foresakan I think then kept nerfing to where it gives like maybe a max of 1/3 where it used to give a full bar. I might be wrong on that number tho but it def got worse.
---
I think it's only once per character.
---
I would a damage super for the boss unless you have somebody who already has whisper with you. Those bosses are super beefy, so you'll need all the help you can get. 
---
There are 3 bosses and they are surrounded by endless ads. You only have to kill the bosses though and you'll want to kill that taken captain first or you're going to be in for a world of pain. I've seen people use the choas reach and nova bomb which both do insane amount of damage.
---
It shouldn't be all that hard. I played for an hour last night running strikes and doing Vanguard and Gunsmith bounties and went from Rank 38 to Rank 41, so hitting 45 shouldn't take long if you do all of your bounties. Even more so if you do them on every character.
---
You can't activate the card for the ordeal nightfalls. It only works on the regular nightfall playlist.
---
Working on my NF how long did it take you
---
My Super is slightly weaker than the Nova Bomb but I can move around, use multiple explosions and get a defense boost, great for killing ads imo.
---
I read that it could be one from the season and one normal drop, so it’s treating them differently...idk though
---
I hate the day I created a blue eyed blue skinned blue warpainted awoken. Every cutscene of the new dlc I dont try to puke. At the last scene of shadowkeep I was sick. I made a ticket about this but they said those changes are permanent and you can only create another warlock. I am not gonna waste time with that after all those hours I spend in the game with him. I use helmet always on in the towers so I almost forgot about it existed till last week.
---
I have the “killed by unknown source” icon in front of “The Architects” as my name rn. So everyone’s getting killed by The Architects in my lobbies
---
I was asking because i need to do a 100k run to complete a mission
---
I'm glad you mentioned it, I forgot GLs are great, Hell, I forgot Full Court even existed at all. I had to look at the Gambit Prime GL to see what it did... I've been ignoring that Essence of Insanity, but it's certainly worth getting
---
(Full Court: "increased detonation damage as the projectile travels further before exploding." just in case someone saw this and also didn't know)
---
I didn’t for this jump I like to explore without it to see what I can do. I have gotten it a few times to find some other spots.
---
Not necessarily, I still use antiope, just with a snipe now lol
---
Then people learned they lied to their players. They learned they bought last day made game.
---
🏅
---
Idk, shadowkeeps story campaign and vex stuff has Been really awesome IMO
---
i just got mine. the new comp is so much better. from someone who doesnt do any raids cause solo player it feels good getting something i wanted.. youll get it, dont give up
---
The end of the video has an explanation that they're not "back", they have nothing else planned at all and their lives make it very difficult to make anything else.
---
Talk to Amanda Holliday
---
Holy shit yes dad
---
I wouldn't recommend this set of armour, as it's missing Undying Armour Mod Slot. 
---
I'd go Vanguard, Crucible, Dreambane or Substitutional Alloy Suit. 
---
Just a pointer if you're into in depth builds and so on ✌️
---
I believe it was removed when First Light/Shadowkeep launched.
---
Sadness...
---
I criticise it daily. Especially when I get shoulder charged for the 10th time in a competitive match. Could it be loads better than it is in every aspect? Sure! But I'm also seeing they are using the seasons to build an over arching story based off the expansion. Right now content is pretty limited, especially in comparison to forsaken.
---
But, forsaken had a year to build it's content and learn what works and what doesn't. Now they are trying to use the seasons to directly build off the expansion, I.E. the new construction in the tower that wasn't there yesterday. 
---
I totally understand a lot if the oints you made but I do actually see effort on Bungies part to address it. I don't discourage a break ever, I took one when Forsaken came out and came back at the beginning of opulence. I wasn't disappointed when I returned.
---
My thought with everyone's gripe about the length of the initial story to shadowkeep is that they want people to get through it three times.. Then they start adding week after week like they were before and every week we keep getting more. So far I've been I've right.
---
As for balance issues, they have always been a thorn in everyone's side but I've found that to be true across most online games. But, I have seen different guns and gun types nerfed and buffed over the years from d1 and d2 and it's always the same story. I'm a hunter main who loves last word, it's not easy, since I lack instant kills with shoulder bashes and I detest shotguns, but it's fun. And if nothing else, they nail those shutting mechanics over any other game out there.
---
The artifact is the only way, gear caps at 950.
---
Keep the purple if it has a good roll keep the blue for the power grind if it's your highest in that slot
---
So first try god roll I have such good luck
---
Ah right that makes much more sense, thanks!
---
We should be fine to finish before the reset day. I was only confused at that part cause i've seen the word reset thrown around in other contexts of the raid (as in, resetting certain parts, for example).
---
Thanks again!
---
You think? I was really annoyed with the,go do this then come talk to eris morn, now go back out there and fight this nightmare boss or whatever, it felt sooooo uninspired, we all know bungie can do better
---
Best thing since sliced bread haha
---
 Had the quest already, was up to the last step of killing 4 while invading, shadowkeep changed it to kill servitor for malfeasance as a quest (removed my original quest), I did as it said, grinded and killed the primeevil servitor  ,the quest went away and gave nothing.
---
Depends, in the early stages of the game i'd always take the one with higher light. Onco you get to about 900 (softcap) you should look for legendaries over blues, even if the blue has more light.
---
What's a good roll?
---
????? Then what is it? Are you just making a comment about a sun going out in the morning or what?
---
Its a hellmouth you could say
---
I mean, as Titans, we are kinda obliged to
---
You have to put a mote into the thing
---
The quest is on a weekly rotation, so this week, you can do it again.
---
Rightio, I think I understand it much more clearly now. Thanks for the help!
---
I will definitely use a guide or something as a reference for navigating around there.
---
so I just have to keep ranking up my artifact?
---
No it wasnt that one. I remember specifically cause I wanted it. I believe there was a video from a trailer. I need to find it
---
Yeah, if you hover over it you can see how much of a power buff it gives you. And how much exp you need to get the next power increase.
---
I would highly recommend the Destiny 2 lfg discord, most of the people you come across are very nice people who like to grind out the game and help other people grind it
---
No it wasnt trinity ghoul. That one splits job arrows and has a chain lightning ability. This one rained down arrows on precision kills.
---
Just appreciating someone who thinks it’s as funny as I do, and sharing it so other people with the same viewpoint can chuckle and connect.
---
1st it always fires 3 arrows
---
2nd on precision kill you supercharge weapon then each arrow acts as conduit and then acts as chain lightning on hit regardless if it is opponent or ground, wall, etc..
---
I like to go yoink a bunch of moon bounties and calibration bounties from weaponsmith guy then do noon stuff first 
---
I save gambit for last because I love gambit the most and like to end on something that I actually enjoy 
---
You will eventually find ya own groove 
---
As for what to farm for prime and exotic engrams I’m not sure I haven’t been getting many primes
---
Their is a reason why the helmet stays on
---
I'd start and complete all story missions, starting from Red War (base game) to Shadowkeep (current DLC). 
---
After you've done that it's pretty much free reign. 
---
Go after exotic quests (check YouTube for hidden quests).
---
Pinnacle Weapons (www.polygon.com/platform/amp/destiny-2-guide-walkthrough/2019/7/3/18760070/pinnacle-weapons-all-exotic-list-weapons-guns-complete-list-season-update)
---
Ritual Weapons (Shadowkeep)
---
Oryx too, but I suppose they didn't want too many Hive and preferred to represent more factions. Considering the threats we've faced, the Fanatic seems out of place here. Even if he is responsible for all of the Scorn, he didn't seem to do much, whereas Crota and Ghaul are infamous for killing tons of Guardians
---
Name the first seven Caydes 0 through 6.

Lets not forget crimson day .
---
"you and your partner are nearly there SHOW ME WHAT LOVE LOOKS LIKE"
---
100%!!!! I was a youngin when I made my first character and he’s basically the only character I play. I don’t feel like putting the time and effort into the other characters as I did with this one. I just absolutely hate the way he looks what my young self thought was cool I am now regretting with everything in my being. Please Bungie!
---
You can submit names but they have requirements, they only accept names from Nordic, Gallic and Inuit mythology.
---
Nah you gotta do the essences again for the gear, happened to a buddy of mine as well. The phantasmal essences are easy to come by and you can trade them for cores.
---
How was it after you hit fabled? I just hit 2100 for the first time ever and had 3 weapons waiting for me, recluse, luna and revoker. I've been eyeing that NF but I don't want to have to sweat it out. I enjoy PvP, but not when I have to use a specific loadout just to have a chance to compete.
---
The part of your in game name showing on that screenshot is a gay slur here in Australia.
---
I'm on 69.420 :(
---
Correct. 
---
Definitely worth it, Shadowkeep has a really good story based around the events from Destiny 1 and the end cinematic from Red War.
---
I have played this game since the day of D1 release and I have honestly reached my limit with the PvE. It is utter garbage and should not have that much powerfuls per week. I have reached legend every season i've played yet I still have to do this trash?
---
You're too kind.  This is something that really should be standard procedure for an MMO.
---
You’re telling me...  not to mention the dupe from the level 25 season pass exotic :(
---
It’s just old weapons with random rolls, nothing more.
---
The solo queue is amazing, but you'll find people like this in there. I came across a lot of Mountaintop/Recluse users, but I just pushed through. The grind is a lot easier than everyone makes it seem. Go for it! It takes time, but even if you're a decent player, you'll hit it eventually.
---
Was it where you were at already or fresh quest start? I'm not fucking fresh starting this shit from bungies incompetence
---
Underrated comment right here ^
---
Hello
---
Yea agreed. Should be able to do all in 3rd or 1st! Riding a sparrow in first person would be pretty neat as well
---
I will definitely pick it up ASAP I’m hearing a lot of good things about it. Has anything changed in the game, since forsaken..game mechanics wise?
---
Thanks for the info bud!
---
Like I said, idk it's my personal experience. Ive watched that video back when the mobility was improved during warmind so I'm not completely sure what was going on for me. I just know what I've experienced since black armory
---
New light player here, if I do exotic quests do exotic weapons and emblems drop with new power level? If not, is it even worth getting old exotics?
---
So much...
---
Armour 2.0 and Finishers are probably the biggest mechanic changes. Have a Google.
---
Man. This game is just so good.
---
You might just want to delete this post my man, it was good but not good enough to be the stupidest post found on destiny subs.
---
Interesting, I will do that now. Thanks again!
---
Nah, it didn't reset for me.
---
✌️ No worries
---
 "Would love to get *Zavala* back in the Crucible, teach the new breed how it's done..."
---
You can lose glory but you can't fall below the rank you are at
---
Don't play it. GG EZ.  Git Gud.
---
Right but like this guys a top speedrunner, if anyone knew wether mobility increased sprint speed then he would, if anything had changed between then and now there would be more info out about it.
---
Its definitely either titans have a slower sprint speed or hunters have a faster sprint speed or a combination of both but its definitely not tied to mobility.
---
And whenever it looks like this, it's another fucking Aeon Soul
---
Happy cake day
---
Alright thanks, and do you know how you get new mods?
---
Besides being able to buy them at Banshee, what are some other ways?
---
The four horsemen of the apocalypse
---
If we had a “3rd Person Perspective” switch for PvE exclusively I would absolutely love it
---
Nice
---
Could be an option for pve. I see no harm in that.
---
Couldnt give a shit
---
https://discord.gg/dDPBf7W
---
Try that one. Sorry I messed up the first one
---
Congratulations, this is such an amazing milestone
---
Can you still earn the Forsaken triumph if you didn’t get black armory?  I’m trying to gauge where I’m at in the game.
---
Ight you do you man.
---
Will my characters be boosted to the current light level or just some characters, how will that affect my gear?
---
I think doing the forsaken campaign. There's a guarantee for a bow there somewhere. If not then legendary engrams from cryptarch or vendor packages
---
How did you do that? To be in 3rd person view?
---
And btw no the game is perfect as a FPS.
---
I don't think bows were introduced until forsaken do you have that?
---
She cheated on me and we broke up so defs destiny haha
---
Why not just buy the game? Like take a week away from buying coffee and just get it
---
Well I mean realistically once you're pushing 1000 with artifact power you should be good to farm the higher ordeals. It's going to take a while but I think it will be perfectly doable.
---
It would have to def not be allowed to run with any mods that are affected by orbs of light thh or else it would be very op
---
I dont get it? You still get it without having the Season pass.
---
Theres a place on the moon where 2-3 nightmare bosses spawn every 5 mins. I managed to get 40 phantasmal fragments in about an hour so id recommend doing that
---
Ya my buddy just got it and we’ve noticed it too. Best I can say is take screenshots and/or file bug reports to bungi
---
Thanks for the answer! So I basically should avoid reclaiming gear from collections and keep one dropped?
---
I just wish some of them would respond to me :(
---
Visit Amanda holiday
---
With season pass is 100 activities and without 400
---
We've been requesting this since the D1 days sadly.
---
I dunno, I'd rather have the proper aiming etc for headshotting more effectively.
---
Played for a year, got legend only after Shadowkeep.  
---
Tells a lot about changes in competitive.  
---
Also, Rule 11:  
---
 Keep all loot/achievement posts to the end of the week thread for them.
---
You'd find yourself abruptly DC'd if you pulled that with me. 
---
But. Well played mate.
---
What's your time zone? I'm in the UK so if your time is similar to mine I could help out after I get home from work.
---
It was indeed a year 1 antiope-d
---
Raid stuff and prime engrams are stuck at 950... Inform yourself before you say others are wrong mkay?
---
One of the trophies is for unlocking all classes which you used to have to play through the missions for but now they're given to you, and I think the other one is reach level 20 but they've done away with those level types so they're basically free trophies / gamerscore
---
r/angryupvote
---
I barely remember jack. The gunplay is just about all thats familiar.
---
Your "religious freedom" does not and should not come before people's right to exist. I'm sorry that you don't like that people other than you exist, but the world doesn't revolve around you or your religion. The existence of lgbt people and their rights aren't political things. Just like how the civil rights movement wasn't political. Discrimination isn't allowed and that's what those lawsuits were about, your religion give you the right to discriminate against people. "it's these people who seem to amass more political power,"  wtf are you on about we by no means have political power, if we did we would already all the rights we need but we don't. It's clear that you don't like anyone who is different from you existing, so i have some advice for you either suck it up and realize you aren't the authority on anything or get off the internet and live on your own. Reality will be waiting for you if you change your mind.

The issue has to do with the way that steam remote play/steam link emulates xinput devices. Installing ViGEm and running a dummy target with GLoSC worked for me in this and any other game that wont detect xinput controllers over steam link. 
---
Install ViGEm first:  [https://github.com/ViGEm/ViGEmBus](https://github.com/ViGEm/ViGEmBus) 
---
Now install GLoSC:  [https://alia5.github.io/GloSC/](https://alia5.github.io/GloSC/) 
---
I use the calculator app as the steam shortcut target (use the add UWP program button in the GLoSC "add new" panel) and launch the shortcut added to steam. Once the GLoSC overlay has launched (you'll see a globe icon in your taskbar), you can close the calculator/whatever app you used and the overlay will be enabled. You may have to power cycle your controller after you enable glosc if it was already on. Make sure to restart your pc after installing ViGEm. If you notice a black screen after starting the GLoSC shortcut in steam, just ctrl+esc or alt+tab away - steam link/remote play does weird stuff with target displays, especially on headless setups with virtualization dongles (4k hdmi virtualization dongle is highly recommended for headless streaming). I can probably help you troubleshoot a bit if you need it.
---
Gotta dunk on the Cabal.
---
got to mythic on monday night then played a load of matches last night back down to fabled 2/3 such a grind will stay away from comp till the weekend now and do some of the other content congrats on legend hope to get it this season as well.
---
Right at the climax. "YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES!!!"
---
Join a clan. I also never did raids with the exception of soloing crota's end, but once I joined a clan, I became friends with a lot of people and I never thought I'd be doing so many raids
---
Wher can I buy Thad
---
Except it's impossible to solo the overlord. 😩
---
On PC.  Still using a year 1 wizened rebuke. Because its dumb AF. 
---
Can confirm I have seen my share if fusions. But i dont think they are any more unfair than imperial decree or last man standing.
---
Same when I was watching a playthrough of it yesterday and happened to me when watching some Borderlands 3 videos as well XD
---
The comic is very old, D2 did not even exist by that time.   
---
Engrams fall like rain today.
---
It's that sexy light gleam on his thigh. Shit is meaty. Fuck, now I'm rock hard too.
---
Dude idk for you, but me it allows me to mitigate some sniper shots when I have to get out from cover to take down a couple of enemies coming at me, well without recovery it's a different story but it also allows me to avoid being instantly killed by those damn Knights rushing at you or coming from behind.
---
I'm giving...bad advice, i'm spouting... like i am the authority. C'mon man wtf !?
---
I’m proud of you guardian
---
thanks my new loadout recomendation combinded with death bringer
---
oh shoot, okay. I get it now, haha. I Feel bad for them.
---
Needs to be on a timer to extends through rounds. Like d1.
---
Now it's time for the catalyst ;)
---
Me also haha
---
Wtf mate, where you got those numbers from !? It affects your sheild...i'm tier 7 and it gives me 10% extra sheild capacity. At tier 10 it gives you 13% sheild capacity. 
---
Aah damn. That's a bummer. How much  more?
---
Now that Legend is practically free! How can you be proud and post about it lmfao.  Super scrub
---
It was before change that way too :)
---
At lvl 22 it is 100 activities because of a thing you get from the season pass.
---
 God. I tried soloing zero hour the other day at 910 light and only got to the tunnels when my time ended. These dudes took like five minutes alone. I just want the pulse rifle
---
*sigh*
---
Unzips
---
No, he needs better internet
---
Only hunter, no, no way, titan with bubble/inertia override or warlock emp rift/well of rad is the the only thing that works I think.
---
Level differences are disabled. You'll still get destroyed until you learn the maps and strategies. Once you know your way around you can do fine, even with "garbage" guns.
---
What the fuck
---
What even does the catalyst do for it anyways? Extra stability, or?
---
Thanks for your input. You are right, it's difficult to grasp a lot of things without someone to guide you. I just joined a clan, hopefully it leads to a much better experience, not that i dislike it.
---
I only play pve. Any pvp-exclusive wep/armor/cat just does not exist for me.
---
The pvp of destiny is p toxic and all my games were full of lag switchers n stuff.
---
I feel like some destiny guns would fit perfectly like single names we could have planet Eyeslunar acrius telesto arbalest STOMP-EE5 Ophidian Ahamkara etc some would fit really well
---
Hm that's lame. It's also ridiculous, those quests took a part of my soul when i had to do them on all 3 characters and now Bungie's like 'hey you know what, you did all that for nothing.'
---
Wow you get loaded into matches? I get a 10 minute black screen then a error message then a 15 min ban for "quiting"
---
Handing out high level gear to new players so they aren't as far behind is usually a death knell for MMOs. A few veterans feel resentment and just leave and new players wonder how much time and effort they really need to put in if there's gonna be more free good stuff later anyway.
---
IM EDGING GUARDIAN
---
This happened to a lot of people I know, including me quite often on Bnet as well.  
---
If it jumps back to Orbit once after a black screen, exit the queue and go back into matchmaking again. It should work fine if it functions the same still.
---
Sorry, all the barbers in the Last City died during the Red War
---
Unfortunately that is the case.
---
Good to see another Polish guardian on this sub though
---
The only crucible exclusive weapon quest I've completed is Redrix's Claymore and only because I got help from a friend. I'm a PvE only player and man am I comfortable playing without any toxicity...
---
Hey wait that’s my line.
---
 Strange that it displays and gives hope that you can get it meh, thanks
---
Yep that's why I win traded for recluse/MT
---
titan is master race although most of the players seem to hate them
---
Agreed
---
You’re a bad person op. You’re like the person who kills everybody in overwatch skirmish when they try to build a player tower
---
pve had its own kind of toxicity...it's died down now, mostly people reminiscing about insta-reload or starting to berate you for not running old strats before going "oh right... its...gone..." i myself rarely saw it but hearing others in my circle talk about it makes me glad that mechanic is super restricted now (demo and a hunter dodge are the only ones i can think of. but i bet there's a few more. whatever people pair with the minigun exotic comes to mind but i cant remember the name of either)
---
My friend said he started at power level 750. I though you start at 50
---
&gt; From a game-play perspective, Bungie didn't want to force new players to play through 4 campaigns worth of old content before they can play Shadowkeep.
---
So basically they just destroyed any feeling of progression... great. Just another gear treadmill, no different from other multiplayer RPGs.
---
I just installed the game, and if there's not a way to start from 0, the way it should be, I'm uninstalling.
---
To set z zeszłego sezonu i nie wiem czy da się go jeszcze zdobyć.
---
You start at 750 now. I've played 4 hours and I'm at 870.
---
Okay, I misread that one.
---
Why not both?
---
Exactly
---
I did 4 matches and they were on the same category and still nothing happens and where can I find these “yellow things”
---
For hunters it would be the triple jump+ the exotic armor leg piece known as "Stompees"
---
Reducing the ammo, gain, will it affect special too?
---
I did too for the first few days of shadowkeep, i tried to time when i play.  Never on peak hours or days and super early in the morning.
---
What is that shader?
---
I thought the fanatic couldn’t die since he says i control death and all that stuff
---
omfg what a savage!
---
Congrats on Recluse.  I got mine the other day and Luna, also parts of other quests where you need fabled, so yep I'm happy with it.  I win more in the solo que as may 60 percent of the time people are starting to work as a team.
---
Google.com
---
Oooh shit!
---
The moment when you’re in menagerie, and you’re standing on a plate and you go to pop your super so you instinctively jump into the air and then you shoot the chandelier that’s above you, wasting your super since everyone’s mowing everything down with recluse. Nice play though. Very well done
---
Bounties, campaign etc.
---
Comment
---
Everything in destiny is a lie! It's just a continues form of "well we have to accept it".
---
I can’t afford to buy both.
---
I keep those in the dark corner of my inventory that I haven't seen in 5 months
---
I know the exact one you're talking about and have done it. I always felt less important now that well of radiance is so powerful. (but not anymore) but thank you!
---
And probably yours too
---
Mars Sunset, believe its from eververse from warmind
---
Then i would start with forsaken and then move to shadowkeep, forsaken did come out first and i myself like to keep things in order.
---
Luna is next for me! Its a beast on console
---
Bet you will
---
 Mostly Nightstalkers in PvE. They’re played more in PvP than PvE
---
Thank you
---
I'll have STICKY FINGAAAS after this
---
Nice dude! I'm 500 points away myself so I'm Hoping to finish over the weekend.
---
tbh Forsaken was a better purchase than Shadowkeep, you should buy it when it comes on sale.
---
Reply
---
Probably the best way is just do vanguard strikes, since your with other people you can hang back let them do the work tell you get use to the mechanics of the game. Doing the main storyline is always good too.
---
I'd also recommend watching YouTube videos. It seems like alot more players are joining back so there is alot of good videos out there explaining this sort of thing
---
Can’t have a double negative so no it is not necrophilia
---
alyo i only can get over 950 loot when my base lvl is 950? not 949?
---
A new capture for my collection, thanks
---
Not 100% sure, but I think the swap is unavalible now, might not be, but if I remember correctly you are fuked.
---
Hunters OP
---
Yea, so can put the intellect (super regen) mod on any piece of armour you want. 
---
The other commentors, the main reason for mas intellect, is that Warlock classes have perks to give back grenade (more powerful than melee) very quickly which negate the need to for fast regen.
---
Voidwalker Devour Perk - Every kill returns grenade energy.
---
Dawnblade Heat Rises Perk - Kills while airborne return grenade and melee energy.
---
Stormcaller Ionic Trace Perk - Chance on kill to spawn iconic trace that when collected, returns some ability energy.
---
Dawnblade Benevolent Dawn Perk - Empowering allies returns some grenade, melee and rift ability.
---
With this in mind, when you think of Warlock Exotics, there is only 3 exotics that help with super regen.
---
Geomag Stabilisers (but only at the end of super bar), Phoenix Protocol (during use of the super itself), Skull of Dire Ahamkara (based on kills with super).
---
As you can see, none that give good fast returns. Hence for max intellect.
---
Don't worry they will be 2.0 armor the next seasons. Bungie likes to introduce old as new :)
---
Two Words
---
per line

---
Moon Bounties
---
Eris Morne
---
6kexp per
---
good luck
---
Shotguns haven’t been a problem as far as I can tell. Shoulder strikes, hand held nova bombs and Jotuun have been the only things that make me want to quit.
---
Yeah I love it, seems to most armor pieces I've tried pretty well
---
Fuck you I’m joining the Hive.
---
Closer to 950 means the more materials you will save. Don’t start infusing things constantly at 900
---
Now that I think about it, I don’t blame the darkness for trying to extinguish all life
---
They got sloppy
---
There is a ton of content you can do for free.  You can progress your character to the same level as a paid player can.  You just cannot do the newest content right now with out paying for it.  The game has never been "free to play"  they decided to let people play the Y1 and some of the Y2 content for free to get more people interested in the game.
---
Just because you are not intelligent enough to figure out there is end game content you can do, does not make them bad at marketing.  Have you done Menagerie? Reckoning? Gambit? Gambit Prime? Leviathan? Eater of Worlds? Spire of Stars? Nightfalls?  These are all endgame activities that you can do.  
---
How can you possible say that Fortnite doesn't milk people?  They charge you for COSMETICS not actually in game content.  You are not buying something new to play or do, just something to put on your character that will be obsolete with the next package they putout in a month or two for another $10 or $20 bucks.  That is milking people.
---
If you don't want to pay for it wait for another year or two and this content will probably be added to the F2P version and those of us that enjoy the game and understand that it cost money to create content and we would rather pay for content, not cosmetics, will continue on with the new stuff.
---
Thighlock the defiled
---
First 2 are countered by the the back button. Jotun is countered by playing behind cover. Just because Destiny gives you a lit of mobility doesnt mean the cover doesnt matter. That's one of the biggest mistakes I see people make when I climb at the beginning of the season. Also, people from higher ranks are likely still climbing out of yours, so dont let the losses get to you.
---
Dick move, but smart in terms of winning.
---
I dont approve, but admire the idea (despite its dirty use)
---
I found that the death match last week was the most fun in crucible I've had in destiny. Control and go fuck itself however
---
Same with me. I was hoping it’d be different after the update.
---
Week I still have the spicy ramen emblem
---
I’ll do you one better 
---
I AM SLOP

Me playing new light
---
We live in the last society
---
Not like this it wasn't.   
---
You might get an ugly message or two over the course of a few rounds in crucible, now it's just a ceaseless unending deluge.
---
Even the drifter would think this is dirty.  Nice.
---
Nope, you are missing to many drops just running one guy...
---
The smallest moon of Saturn? That'd be the Micro Mini
---
Well yes but actually no
---
That's a good question.
---
Obviously the Pyramid is responsible for them appearing, but I think they're directly linked to the person the Pyramid is trying to haunt.
---
Eris lost her Fireteam long before Destiny 1, but being on the moon with the Pyramid it creates nightmares / phantoms of her Fireteam because it knows she feels responsible for their deaths and guilty only she made it out. So she's a perfect candidate for it to haunt.
---
Much like Crota, Ghauk and Taniks came to us in the first mission in the form of Nightmares, they were passed enemies we defeated previous, yet almost dying to.
---
I'm sure if Zavala was in our place, venturing towards the Pyramid, he would see nightmares / phantoms of his fears and regrets.
---
I remember! I always get one guy sat next to the portal, zero kills, zero motes, then invades and insta dies and doesn’t take the hint
---
Yeah but my point is I'm enjoying the game rather than playing the same thing over 3 times. I hated playing that way and now I don't have to.
---
Especially when it's so much easier to get Recluse now. I knew you couldn't drop levels of Glory anymore, but I saw someone say you could drop from, say Brave II to Brave I. Glad to see that isn't true.
---
Forsaken all the way ! Badass cut scenes, 2 new maps, awesome story. Just better man...
---
( And something happens in Forsaken that is a bit spoiled in Shadowkeep, you don't wanna be spoiled )
---
That was really petty. You should either emote and accept your loss, or try and fight like a regular player.
---
Nice! I just came back after a year so I need to figure out how forges work! Seems like a great reward for grinding!
---
The trickster
---
Okay that makes sense. Thank you!
---
Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather, he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank just outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold.
---
I’ll try being a little more conservative. Thanks for the tip.
---
i was jus kidding boiii
---
I thought you had to make it Heroic.
---
r/uwutranslator
---
Great work! Thank you very much.  
---
It would also be great to add activity-specific mods to the list, such as nightmare and raid mods.
---
By the way, what gear can roll with slots for such mods? **Only** shadowkeep and vex offensive armor, or some Y2 armor as well?
---
Fun Fact: I have never vaulted Ace since the day i got it on September 10th last year.
---
It’ll buff out
---
The best gaming husbandu/waifu alongside Shaxx?
---
Yeah him
---
No problem 👍
---
u/uwutranslator
---
There are alot of LFG Discord Channels also.
---
Or people who aren't actually good at the game so they use every crutch in the game they can use because balance.
---
Or cheats. Feels like with steam cheating in rampant.
---
U have already reach the soft cap of 900 light level so powerful drops are your only way to power past 900. As for Derivm's tokens, he will probably only reward u stuff that's close to your light level now that u have hit the soft cap (anything from 900-903 for a rough gauge) when u turn the tokens in
---
Pls correct me if I'm wrong but that's wat I understand so for
---
Lol he had a scene of dialogue with themselves. That was cool.
---
Try going back to him and seeing if you can pick it up again
---
Anyone know if there’s a way to hold more bounties at one time? I see additional pages big once I hit like 25 it maxes out.
---
Some hunters lure in their prey.

---
&gt;Yep that's why I win traded for recluse/MT
---
I was curious what he said and can't reply to his deleted comment
---
The reviewers are not being paid off. The reviewer will review the game, and, as it stands, the game itself is free to play. Bungie has made Destiny 2, and the DLC up to Forsaken, completely free to play. This is, outside of making *everything* free, all they can do.
---
The fact that you have to pay for an online membership for your chosen platform is not something Bungie can control. This is the case for any, and all, multiplayer games on both Xbox and Playstation, as far as I'm aware.
---
Paid membership is not a 'gotcha' mechanic. It's made very clear by Sony and Microsoft that you need to subscribe to their services to play with people from around the world. I completely understand your frustration, but it's important that you don't take it out on Bungie, or any other developers of your favourite games - it's not something they have a say over.
---
Go see Holliday in the Tower Hangar
---
Ok I’m sry didn’t know
---
I just started playing D2 a few days ago and I love running into other players. It’s always awesome to be randomly killing enemies and having someone else join in.
---
As someone at legend yes you constantly match and are matched with low or even 0 glory players, in regards to trueskill it is supposed to match on skill however I found that lobbies actual skill of players varied greatly which led to a lot of matches being very lopsided towards one team.
---
Question the fook? I didn't know we could do that! I've done that strike soooooo many times too.
---
Well jokes on you i dont think pc was available at that time
---
There is no max power level. Your gear can max at 960 but with the artifact you can keep going past it.
---
Wrong sub?
---
Wrong subreddit? We discuss how the moon is full of space monkeys here, sorry pal
---
STOP
---
Oh shit my bad
---
Atm can't say seeing bungo completely broke hand cannons. But it can one tap sooo...
---
Thanks for the help
---
I mean... you didnt see that coming?
---
What's this new solo queue? I didn't have the time to play comp this season yet. Finished with 2500 last season playing solo, got LH. Should I try NF and also am I capable? Im exited with this new thing.
---
I'm a man with too much time on his hands
---
If you get the season pass along with it I think it’s worth it. The content is being released over time and rn its just a power level grind
---
Ah so its worthless to refarm them basically, thanks bud!
---
doesnt mean it wont
---
Sorry to bust your bubble but this exotic raid weapon quest unlocks for everyone once the raid was first completed.
---
&gt; but would it hurt to have options?? Would it really affect you?
---
Worse, actually: it’d affect OTHER people very badly. For the reasons I highlighted in my comment, it would be a terrible experience with no upside. Yes, it would hurt to have the option.
---
I WANT people to raid. I WANT people to have fun. Matchmaking is not the way to do that until game matchmaking systems are much, much more sophisticated. It would turn people off raiding, turn people off the game, and nobody wins.
---
The best solution is obviously to have an integrated LFG system in the game. Not matchmaking, but an in-game tool similar to the LFG server with all its functions.
---
&gt; Let them eat cake!! 
---
Uh... I don’t think that phrase means what you think it means lol
---
Hehe, you hit the wrong sub, anyway grab Ingram if you could, if not Gore is your man, Bills are good this year.
---
The 2019 moments of triumphs seal you can’t obtain anymore. That’s about it I believe.
---
We have been blessed by steam names
---
But you can go down the tiers of rank.
---
Went from brave 3 to 1 in an hour. ._.
---
Talk to Amanda holiday in the tower hanger.
---
Only played 2 hours? Yeah, you shouldn’t have wasted your time typing out those paragraphs cause now there isn’t a single opinion you could throw out that would be valid.
---
It would appear that my knowledge is somewhat out of date! My apologies. The principle remains the same though, in that you shouldn't waste resources on infusing early on in the game.
---
One of the best things is them listening to all your commands and taking your advice. Since were veterans
---
Mtashed has a good video about armour god rolls
---
where did you get that much legendary shards?
---
Definitely spoilers, a lot of people haven’t played yet.
---
Prior to the rate of fire and trench barrel nerf, yes, it was a wonderful shotty. Now, it’s pretty much like any other shotty. My Recluse is my main secondary these days.
---
I found my clan by playing against them in PvP, but just LFGing to raid with people or run quests, dungeons, weapon grinds, whatever.... eventually you will find people you gel with. Keep in mind, it won't be everyone so don't get discouraged. Plus with the new expansion, there are plenty of clans recruiting right now.
---
Pain and misery my guy, pain and misery. But it's the only PvEvP game where you kill ads to spawn a boss, and the enemy team can invade your game to try and stop you. Not a fun game when playing with randoms.
---
Wait does that mean you can earn forsaken weapons by playing but can’t equip them?
---
There is no *set* max Power level this season. The maximum gear score is 960 - you can reach 950 through Powerful rewards, and Pinnacle rewards can take you up that last 10 levels. 
---
Your Seasonal Artifact provides a flat power bonus, and can be levelled up as many times as you can manage. Theoretically, you can make it past 1000 Power, but you'd need to spend *a lot* of time trying to. 
---
Artifact Power Bonuses are applied straight to your level. Powerful and Pinnacle drops don't take this into account. For example, if my total Gear Score is 929, but my Artifact gives me a +6 bonus, then my overall Power will be 935. However, Powerful and Pinnacle rewards will level according to my Gear score, so a +1 Powerful would drop at 930, not 936.
---
Hope this helps.
---
Bit of a newb question: the nightfall ordeal this week is listed as the moon, but the nightfalls listed here are different. Why is that? Are you able to launch certain strikes as nightfall, directly? Do they give the same rewards (not including the weekly)?
---
Only cause scout rifle
---
Reckoning... That's the down side, getting a good roll. But MKC is a must
---
Titan in the background still laughing 😂
---
I remember d1 being a two hit kill except throwing knife precision and SC. In fact shotgun punch was really popular because shotguns didn't 1hko either (for the most part?) Fusion grenades were ultimate meta.
---
SC seems to be kinda contraversal but imo every class has something 'op'. Warlocks have instant heal grenades with void bottom tree and hunters have invis/wallhacks with middle void- tho I do think the Nerf to that was a little harsh. I think one eye mask unbalances things in regards to each classes abilities because of wallhacks too but honestly if you try playing a titan with just SC you'll find that it's high risk/reward and can't hold up in any competitive regard while heal nades and wallhacks certainly can. SC can be frustrating for non-titan classes but other than outliers like OEM all we have is SC, suppress nades and idk throwing hammer?
---
Pinnacle weapons as in Exotic weapons? Sorry I don't know much of the game and the drops
---
For sure. Divinity runs are petra run lites. Yeah, they’re intense but it’s just like any other raid. Everyone needs to calm down (especially those people that post requirements ala Ghorn or kick) the raid came out Saturday, the streamers were at the boss for 5+ hours for a reason. Give people a chance and just keep trying. It’ll happen.
---
I love seeing people like you who post about their triumphs. It makes me happy being able to support another gamer as that's what we should all do. Not tank each other based on skill or what gear we own, rather have mutual respect for one another. We're all part of a big family, everyone needs to act like it
---
No feelings with box breathing is better
---
Light does not matter for gambit except for prime.
---
Well all overshields highlight the character red and turn the health bar turns turquoise color, right? The ones I saw look similar to pve elemental shields but are visible before you damage them.
---
I'm not seeing an issue here...
---
I'll add you more later I've been having a few days off from work. And i literally pulled off a all-nighter lol now I feel super tired hahaha
---
Is it even possible for a new comer to farm for it ?
---
if you can already get it now why is there another quest coming out for it on the 29th? (According to the season calendar)
---
So again they fucked up, the crater spark triumph says arc melee kills the literal only progress I was able to make was with a zero ammo arc sword... god dammt
---
THIS IS AMAZING!
---
Ohhh okay. Must be a bug then because it still greyed out when I equip it on my auto rifle and it’s not effected barrier enemies
---
Nah fam you need to get 14000 medals and 450 kills
---
From what I understand, Shadowkeep is this years overarching content while the vex stuff is just the seasonal content. 
---
I would expect the Shadowkeep story to continue developing throughout the year while the seasonal stuff will come and go while contributing things to the world and maybe story. 
---
Will just have to wait and see what each season and updates through the year bring as far as actual story is concerned. They have said they want to develop and evolve the story and world more consistantly with the new game model but this is a new setup so onely time will tell I suppose.
---
Wait. Impossible. I’ve done this strike at least 100 times since vanilla and never seen this. God this game always has something that reminds me I suck
---
Box breathing is the only thing I can thing of that might be better than MKC. Easier to proc, but with a delay. I want that rifle tho
---
Crosta's gohst essence, gotta be deliviered to Eris
---
not if you’re using sweet business that autoreloads when you step on a brick :)
---
Have you tried the LFG in the Destiny 2 Discord channel? There's Whisper quests daily....
---
Sorry for enjoying casual over competition
---
Arc Melees worked fine for me on a titan.
---
What?
---
Compound meme, 13/10
---
Before the base game went FTP, the legacy quests were the main quests, with The Red war as the original campaign, then Curse of Osiris and Warmind as the first 2 dlcs.
---
What the crap man. I'm level 25 on the season pass track (iirc), and I've had 0 exotic drops thus far.
---
The exotics in their hands does.
---
PC usernames like this give me life
---
do you want it to be highly textured..?  Lol
---
I thought the PvP encounters were light-enabled in both modes, unless they changed it.
---
Void makes sense to be the only thing to do it in the Destiny Universe as it’s the representation of Gravity. 
---
Nightstalkers weaken enemies by overweighting them with Void Anchors or weightlessly wield ultra-dense Void Blades that have that can dish out more impactful damage (in other terms, KE=1/2mv^2) than most larger swords, Sentinels use their shields and Ward of Dawn to add so much weight to passing bullets that they drop straight down, and Voidwalkers use Void to create supercondensed explosions from either raw Void energy or even themselves. 
---
Arc just wouldn’t make sense because it represents Electromagnetism, and thus power generation, for which the Thunder Coil and Arc Battery perks make perfect sense.
---
Those are like the easiest pvp challenges
---
Should be easy to do pvp now. Even trash players are legend rank. Pvp is watered down for pve players to feel accomplished, so you should be good to go.
---
i feel like theres no sbmm
---
r/softwaregore
---
Rip the second challenge
---
The only good exotics in gambit are all pre shadow keep
---
It is so good. I have a box breathing roll and an explosive rounds roll and both do really well but the box breathing one out shoots every other scout in the game.
---
More XP and progress towards flashpoint progression, as well as a chance at better loot.
---
I'm at work. Sorry 😟
---
To what? Current story? It's still incredibly relevant as a gear farm for some of the best weapons in the game. Trust, beloved, austringer, erentil all easily farmable
---
Lol Ged Gud
---
Eat ass, titan skate fast and punch your way through the vault of grass. *Torpedoes at raid boss*
---
First, light level does not matter in gambit
---
Second I have lost plenty of first round in gambit and won the match. 
---
Third, it’s not full on pvp. .  You have to pay attention to how many motes the enemy has banked and if they have a portal active.  As soon as you hear there an invader present you should be locating him to either neutralize him or run and hide if you have a lot of motes.  Yes the invader as an overshield but combined fire will take it down quickly.
---
While we're at it: Jump and melee while holding the orb for more speed than normal running.
---
3rd person games can suck me dry. Like ewww, who would want this?
---
Tldr: Gambit is crap and broken and not fun, don't play. Sorry bungie hates us
---
First off, Gambit doesn't have power level advantage. So it doesn't matter what power they are, I've been owned by someone that was under 750 (pre shadowkeep obvi).
---
Beyond that you're basically right. It's a crappy pvp ish game mode where once you get out down a few times in the beginning it's very hard to catch up. Your only chance at winning is when the primes are popped around the same time and you can trade/cancel invader kills.
---
I've always been annoyed how prime evil Slayer stacks work. If you rush to your prime, and then kill envoys and hang out while your opponents are catching up you'll have a huge stack advantage over them and have 0 chance and doing more damage than them supering the evil to death....
---
The only upside I can say is that with the newest super nerfs it's slightly better because everyone isn't supering ALL THE TIME
---
Thanks so much!
---
One more question: How does the Menagerie relate to an average Raid in terms of Time and Difficulty?
---
I havent played D2 in ages and I'm teaching some friends the game. Would this be a good but challenging mission? Or should we stick to strikes or something else for now? We average about 785 power rn.
---
Nope
---
I was doing an old strike for a quest.
---
I didn't realize it until halfway through but it was at nightfall difficuly scaled to my light level
---
It took me 57 mimutes to finish the strike and kill Brachus the Undying completely alone.
---
My gear was locked in on arc staff Sweet Business, and a masterworked Bug-out bag.
---
Luckily I had a grenade launcher and a pretty good memory of the strike. Otherwise certain portions would have been impossible to beat
---
Didn't RoI last a while year without anything new added? Is that preferable to our current system of content spread out over a year?
---
Not only did they take many lives, but they took our sense of fashion.  Unforgivable.
---
I thought you could pick it up from the map now? Or is that only heroic?
---
Come with me, and you’ll see, a whole new world of OSHA violations.
---
Wow, does this work in Chasm of Screams, any but helps with that absolute hell fuck of a mission.
---
Pinnacles are the quests you can pick up from the vendors (21% delirium is the “by your bootstraps” quest from drifter for example)
---
They’re legendaries with exclusive perks and for the most part are on par with most exotics
---
LoLoLoLoLoLoL
---
Okay.
---
He's a hunter, of course he's gonna do it
---
On the destination map it said "PVP advantages enabled"
---
Dunno what it means.
---
You have to do the whole vex offensive activity one time through without dieing. It’s probably days negitave because you’ve died all the other times
---
Honestly, it kind of was. This felt more like an Expansion than a full-blown story DLC. I hope that this is just the prologue and the DLC shows more of itself in the months to come.
---
Ok then don't go on the subreddit where you might see spoilers. Easy fix.
---
For me, completely the opposite. I really enjoy this game mode, you need to pay extra attention because of the pve/pvp elements, but its balanced in a way. Like, I never lost a match with huge difference. I did win one, when our Prime had more health, but my team did well on invade, and healed the enemy prime enough, to be able to win. Prime is more tense, it felt harder, but faster.
---
I believe he is referring to the exotic quest.  Probably the crucible kills part to use an ar
---
Don't. Swords are bad
---
Basically, it’s not just Call of Duty with Space Magic now
---
Shaxx is the ultimate hype man and everyone needs a friend like him
---
by playing any of the "non-comp" modes.
---
 It's my opinion relative to my experience of the game, how can you pass judgment on my experience? Just because your experience differs from mine doesn't make mine wrong. 
---
Many people have raised the same issue so it isn't isolated to just me.
---
His wider audience is, so he would bring 10 yr olds in. Just because you are the minority in terms of his viewership doesnt make his comment false.
---
SHE PISSED ON MY FUCKING TRIBUTE, AND SHE SAID HER COVEN WAS "THIS BIG" AND I SAID THATS DISGUSTING
---
How do we get the quest line for this beauty.
---
Lore-wise and physics-wise I agree. Gameplay-wise bubble is too strong with oppressive darkness. Why would you play anything else?
---
Maybe OP likes them?  Who cares if they're bad.
---
Nah man this is def cheating
---
I TAKE THIS BACK CAUSE I REALIZE THEY ARE A WARLOCK
---
You need to have a good team or invader. Bank motes like crazy, so your invader can go over. If they invader you then have heavy ready or a sniper to get rid of them. It's easy enough with some practice. If you give up because you start to lose them you won't be winning anything in destiny. 
---
Light level doesn't effect anything other than the PvP effect of the game. If you're not invading then it's not an issue. Invaders can one tap even the highest light level person, so don't be salty if they kill you because it's their job. 
---
The only reason vets hate gambit is because bungie made us grind it for numerous seasons and everybody got their fill, but we still have grind and haven't really gotten a break to recover from it.
---
 If you get mad because somebody wins instead of you then you're not going to have a good time playing destiny.
---
FIND SOMEONE WHO GIVES A DAMN
---
Same! I just don't understand why some people have this need to put others down so often on here it just doesn't make sense.
---
Does the Sacrilege mission still give out Graviton Lance? I did it last week and don't remember being offered any weapons.
---
I am just asking because I don't see a bunch of people playing it when I am on.
---
Just google it. It would have taken you less time to google and find them post here
---
But as a not shitty response. If you have access to Mercury, there's a triumph for finding all the secret nodes or whatever (little solar/arc/void glowing things) follow a YouTube video, kill them all, takes less than an hour, get exotic sparrow and sword
---
Weapons get worse quests stay the same... actually they got worse too revoker and especially the recluse were much easier.
---
Only heroic.
---
Thanks, I appreciate that
---
Lol
---
If you don't have the weapon already, you will need to trigger the standard version by killing the taken minotaur that spawns during the taken blight event.  \*THIS CAN ONLY BE DONE ON WEEKENDS\*
---
I have visited Eris number of times I have done everything except the raid.
---
The top one won’t be doable until the end of the season when the Ikora finishes building a gate to the undying mind and final vex offensive begins.
---
I'd love it but only in PvE.
---
A simple shot in the head from any sniper does the job as well
---
It’s a year 2 exotic so you won’t have the quest
---
I sure hope thats sarcasm
---
Legit was doing risk/reward with my hunter I created before The Great Move, and had a bunch of new hunters constantly shooting and fisting me. I just did the confused emote and "This is fine" before they all ran off.
---
Hoorah for another user with the superior meta lol! If you have trouble with those pesky recluse users and slide shotgunners use anonymous autumn with full auto and kill clip with all range perks and accuratized rounds. It's base damage is MORE than recluses so you'll almost always win in a 1v1, and the kill clip does 54 to the head I believe. It's seriously underrated and absolutely smacks with mountaintop. It saved my life countless times to legend and wouldn't have gotten it without it.
---
I’m looking for the Lumina chest if anybody could help would be great GT jeffbubz 👍🏻
---
If you have played league of legends for as long as I have  nothing like this bothers you 😉
---
We had to wait about a month and a half after it launched on console.
---
It sucked.
---
Sorry, your submission has been automatically removed. 
---
It appears you are asking a question about LFG/Clans, or help in-game. 
---
Please post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/bzjpkr/official_lfg_megathread_v_4/) instead, look at the LFG dropdown menu on the top bar of the subreddit for various LFG resources, or check the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/bvr9ex/official_faq_please_read_before_posting/?) for possibly helpful advice on how to find people to play with our advertise/find clans.
---
I believe light level 750 is the minimum now.
---
Thank you, I did this and it said to go to shaft 13 and so I did, chest was there! But when I opened it I didn’t get Lumina. I got the continued quest where you need to cleanse thorn and now the lumina quest and system pos device is gone. I’m confused. But I got two quests for thorn, two different steps.
---
Maay I ask what is the spreadsheet you are talking about and where do I find it ?
---
How do i the new finisher on xbox
---
he said he has forsaken..
---
So berguasia AND gofannon
---
So I've played Destiny and Destiny 2 on and off for years, never tried PvP once...weird random request but would anyone on PC be willing to show me the ropes?  I'd love to get into it, I just feel overwhelmed and never want to a hinder to my team, so I avoid it.
---
Hobgoblin: Aight imma head out
---
You've already left a comment AND sent me a message.
---
The shot would have finished it. That’s the point of the that super.
---
Hold it
---
I played d1 I got both versions of the khvostov even at that point it was not considered too meta. I have good aim. It just that the weapon is weaker in destiny 2.
---
I'm not sure it's possible yet
---
Used to all these new light players asking dumb questions.  It wasn’t tied to forsaken dlc but season after that.  Did he buy all the seasons
---
Also why can’t people just search Bungie forums
---
Unless you have more than one Titan in your group. It would benefit you a lot more to have one running bubble as a defensive Titan and one running Sun warrior so you have an Offensive buff too
---
W o a h... so we can actually break 1k???
---
you fancy-pants titans with your Peregrine Greaves!   I still don't have them :(
---
Farm eris bounties. Buy as many repeatable as you can and go into a lost sector to finish them all then rinse and repeat. Fastest way to farm levels so far
---
KISS! MY! PISS!
---
It does around 164, Guardian's even with 0 Resiliance have 185 health.  It will one shot if you have a damage buff like Weapon's of Light and maybe some others I'm forgetting, but by itself it'll only leave them super wounded.     He was getting KO's cause of Team Fire.
---
Find a yellow bar boss and kill it.  Lost sectors are good place to farm then
---
Bruh I agree
---
Not to mention, this is the first post of its kind on THIS sub. Nobody cares if you beat niris to it on another sub.
---
What class would you say you have got the most enjoyment out of?
---
Nah not really. Everyone knew uldren was a douche from the jump.
---
Sounds good.
---
Come to think of it shouldn't it be very easy to test out?
---
you get everything with the annual pass when you buy forsaken.
---
I cant say what the combo would be, but it would require everyone to use the right super with the most damage output and the same heavy weapon that does the most damage.
---
It will probably be doable pretty soon, I've had groups get it down in 2 phases and nearly got it down in 1, but most people are working on undying right now so speed and damage arnt high on their list.
---
NO, God please No. I’ve been trying since the quest came out, four long raids, all ending in sadness and despair. Don’t make this happen again. I can’t handle another one
---
I’ve found as a crummy PvP player than I can just play Control over and over and generally not get too pissed. I focus on capturing and helping my team win. I almost always have the lowest kills, but I also usually have the highest captures and I’ve gotten some pretty decent streaks (for me). I’m able to reset my valor rank a few times each season doing this.
---
That works. Point is if a titan goes too fast into something too much they fucked.
---
You don’t so much acclimate as you do learn to enjoy it
---
This is weirdly wholesome
---
Where would we be without the field of dreams😂
---
Happened with me twice on Gofannon now.

It’s possible you did accidentally buy the dlc’s already but what’s more likely is that you are just seeing the locations associated with each dlc. Everyone can visit the tangled shore, moon, etc no matter what dlc you have. You just can’t do the missions and stuff
---
I respect your opinion but I think it would detract from what keeps me in this game.  The gunplay.  I dont think you can have the same gun experience while in third person.
---
It's a doodad aka a thingamajig aka a whatmacallit
---
assassins is only on a melee kill in pvp..
---
and wormhusk kinda got nerfed into grab (barely gives half your hp back now)
---
OEM gives hp, shield, overshield, tracking (albeit shortend) AND increased damage..
---
its like mashing a GOOD version of wormhusk/assassins cowl and foetracer (which both.. are kinda meh) into 1 exotic.
---
Or do patrols they are fast and easy. You get one resonant stems per patrol
---
But you got it done. That's what's important!!
---
If you don't have the 'special' weapons or exotics, pvp is just not worth your time. It takes you too long to kill, but they can kill you in .4 seconds. That's physically not enough time to do anything skillwise to prevent it. 
---
Also kinda laughing at all the people in this thread insinuating that pvp is balanced around one class having a one-hit kill. lolwhat? There's a reason you never see warlocks mentioned in these threads.
---
So it's only on new armor, so anything you earned before ShadowKeep won't have the option, any legendary armor you earn now will have the option under the appearance screen,
---
Quality times with new guardians
---
Yep!! My heart is beating so hard lol
---
Buttrogers55
---
The ornament is probably the only ornament I will ever actually buy with my money
---
SO IM MAKING A CALLOUT POST ON VAN-NET, SAVATHUN, YOU GOT A SMALL COVEN, IT’S THE SIZE OF THIS OGRE BUT WAY SMALLER, AND GUESS WHAT, HERE’S WHAT MY ASCENDANT REALM LOOKS LIKE
---
**psshhhh**
---
It probably won't.
---
My best guess is that the game will follow the same road games like GW2 take; certain free content from expansions, while the main content is locked behind buying the expansion, but nothing from the expansion is needed in other expansions.
---
Sadly kinder guardians wont understand  :(
---
I'm trying to figure this out, too... Apparently, nobody knows the answer to this. I go to Drifter but he doesn't give the Draw quest.
---
im not bad at pvp but surely im not good, these missions really piss me off, i don't like pvp.
---
Yup 
---
Definitely on mercury. 
---
Osiris is up to something there!
---
1pm EST. Its 11am for MST.
---
Thank you, been trying with my clan today but we can barely get him to one yellow bar
---
\*PTSD intensifies from D1 year1\*
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
oh good its fake damn I think I need to go back to rehab
---
*feels bad man*
---
Idk, I just want to get to 2100 and then get out \\_(シ) _/
---
Just like Shadowkeep gives you the Forsaken activities.
---
The difference here is that GW2 handles it via LS you still have to buy if you join late; the equivalent of other activities in D2.
---
All forges craft all weapons now
---
I have disabilities too, asshole, stop white knighting when you don't even know who you are talking too. 
---
I don't just sit around waiting for people to fix my problems, I take action and try different things. It's empowering. 
---
Stop making drama out of nothing.
---
Dont bother with vendor armor
---
('-'*ゞ
---
Well it sucks ass even my Titan dies quickly even with high resilience it’s a joke
---
I was trying different ones but still couldn't do it without a struggle
---
But I just got the khvostov and its white.
---
I'm really curious about the quality if them. I started after Forsaken had been out for a while, and didn't really start playing until Opulance, so this is my first real raid prog. I'm excited to get a jacket for my first prog attempt.
---
While power stops mattering after a while. One you hit 770 (I think its around 20 levels higher than the reccomened) you stop reciveing benefits. So if you do that quest at 770 compared to 900, it will be the exact same difficulty. This is just so you cannot blaze through everything
---
One of the labels should be "not knowing where to go in Strikes."
---
Holy shit...I spent like 20 minutes yesterday frantically messaging and emoting at two blueberries trying to get them to stop randomly patrolling on Tangled Shore and go into the first part of Broodhold. The Strike doesn't load unless you get your whole group of 3 to the first gate where the Hive Knight carrying the explode-y worm thing spawns.
---
I kept managing to get one of them to follow me there, then they would leave and *run all the way fucking BACK OUT* while I went to fetch the other duckling to get him to follow me there too. I know we should be patient with newbies but holy hell that was frustrating. It's partly the fault of the Strike's design -- it should just pull your fireteam with you rather than waiting until they decide to come along with you to load part of the Strike.
---
These Strike-like quests, I don't remember exactly
---
Ah yes the hawksaw. Many memories...
---
I got the gun and it was white, not exotic.
---
I think I managed to do that one a while ago. Not sure tho, I don't remember the names.
---
Oh so they were apart of the forsaken dlc thanks
---
The salt flows strong with you, my young apprentice. 😂😂
---
Outbreak perfected, mountaintop, recluse, huckleberry
---
Those are some of my suggestions, ive been out of the pve loop and idk what the absolute best is this season
---
I've been playing this nearly every day since Destiny 2 came out. I never knew about this. \*mind blown\*
---
The whole point of the f2p version in my eyes is to get people to play the game to see if they like it, and if they do, invest in the expansions to get the full experience. If there is nothing we can say to convince you to buy the rest of the content, then the f2p did its job in showing you that the game isn’t for you.
---
it used to give destination materials so people would farm it
---
Same need it for mysterious box as well
---
I get that it's not supposed to be too easy but if I have to put over one clip into an opponent that isn't a boss then it's pretty annoying. Especially when there's 3 of them at once. The damage they deal is crazy too.
---
I won’t love Ghost until they bring back the Dinklebot
---
I feel so bad for you. But you tried your best to get them to follow. And that would have been so funny if i were to add it in. Ive been pretty much soloing strikes right now until they understand how to do them
---
Yeah man no problem
---
I'll tell you more detail when my crown of sorrow jacket arrives but I think it is reasonable good
---
the boomer gamer in you is too strong for you to overcome i see
---
Used to? Does it still? Even if it does, the point still stands that Ignitions are still a cooperative situation. You don't need to just participate; you need to succeed.
---
Is it worth getting forsaken if I haven’t already
---
I just had a guy reply hi to me saying we need to make it heroic and not melt the boss
---
season pass adds new weapons, new pass armor, pass/quest exotics and vex offensive(it should be noted the pass is a silver purchase but if you buy shadowkeep it comes with the pass for the first season after that its 1000 silver per season).  The expansion adds raid, a few exotics, dungeon and a new armor set etc.
---
Another edit: the season pass is account bound but shadowkeep is not.
---
Hot tip: you can use y1 stuff from collections. May not have the best stats but it is 2.0 compatible. As for the old ornaments, you may find this interesting: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xV3ECam4bgk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xV3ECam4bgk)
---
don't worry babe, you got this! try going for mobility and playing around with being fast and dodgy! you might like it a bit better!
---
Or they can play the game and learn? Just like you did.
---
Oh! You're approaching me.
---
Using a finisher on a cursed thrall is the most titan thing I’ve ever heard of. Keep up the good work.
---
How can I unlock the black amory?
---
It’s honestly personal opinion. You get three raids (all are fun to do) a lot of exotic quests that you can’t get with new light. And a really good story but kinda sad at the same time. I personally really loved forsaken because it was a really well done dlc and had a lot to offer. Ive played since D1 first launched and its one of my favourite dlc’s from all of the content that is included
---
I was literally googling how to do this now. Drifter didn't have the quest or the item you need to cleanse to start with :(
---
😂😂😂
---
oh you.
---
Oh wow it’s actually called a Duster lol. I must have it now.
---
If I didn't love one-two-perigreeves fuckin any major/boss in sight I would totally do this build instead.
---
I can’t believe it’s actually called a Duster lol. It is no doubt Flame retardant and perfect for ocular pat downs.
---
If your a titan with high mobility u can just jump over it learn from the vet
---
That’s all I need I’ll definitely get now.  Had it on ps4 and didn’t play much cause I’m just bad at console and like pc more but now it free and with cross play so I’m really getting back into it thnaks
---
Does the dynamo perk on the leg armor still exist? In the armor 2.0.
---
Moons hurted
---
2 game modes that I don't play and exotics that aren't very good. I much rather deal with year 1 exotics as it increases the RNG for exotics I actually want with less in the pool. Bottom line there should have been some type of pre-purchase warning explaining what's to come, if you don't agree with that then we agree to disagree.
---
I think you're complaint is with the overall ttk
---
Ah yes, Savathan, the twin brother of Savathún, who is absent from the lore because he made a political comment at a family dinner.
---
Last word isn’t great in pve honestly
---
Working with others is fine, but you still need to play with others at a similar skill level. 
---
You wouldn’t want to be in crucible at 400 glory matches with a stack of unbroken players would you? Same goes for raids.
---
Or 'fitting to'
---
I fuck with it
---
;)
---
Honestly when i saw daughter of Crota, I was just utterly disappointed.  I don't  big lore enemies should be in strikes. They deserve a raid or own event. Id like to see a event with all the oryx family enemies.
---
Same problem here
---
Fair enough. It is very fun after all
---
*A nightmare manifests..*
---
I remember the murderous rampages I went on in D1 with the last word lol. Holy shit it felt like cheating.
---
Def Forsaken, campaign wise.
---
Not just you. People are just making stuff up lately lol
---
Oh alright. I’m an old school D1 player, so I’ve still been catching on with how this game changes things. The Zhalo was my gun back then. My only problem is I don’t have any friends that play this, and I’m pretty sure matchmaking is only for the Shadowkeep 750 light nightfall strikes.
---
I'm glad I don't have to put a sniper rifle in a heavy slot.
---
I'm 901 w/o shadow keep. Just keep on equipping gear with higher lvl numbers and raise your overall level, then higher items drop. Forget about the stats.
---
If you want to gear quick do the vex invasion. You need to complete the intro quest.
---
https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.pcgamer.com/uk/amp/destiny-2-eyes-on-the-moon-quest-vex-invasion-timer/
---
Here's how. You do not need shadow keep to go to the moon or do this event
---
My engrams are 750 but if you like the stats, you can right click the item and have the option of dismantling another higher piece of equipment to boost it to the same lvl. However this costs some materials.
---
yeah the pvp community are assholes. except for hush and th3 jez
---
Why?
---
You can also pull pinnacle weapons from collections
---
Malfeasance is good if you want to kill invaders. Killing the flying meatball boss in gambit starts it's quest. 
---
Otherwise, Ace of Spades.
---
Damnit my 8K projector for my collection of Eliksni 'art' broke, where am I going to get a new one?
---
I know!
---
*sneaks into Black Garden and steals a harpy*
---
This will do
---
*FEW HOURS OF "IMPROVING" LATER*
---
Zavala: Guardian, I know you are having a break but I need you to join this fire-
---
#- WHAT IN TRAVELLER'S NAME IS THAT?!!
---
no heavy, no super. Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
---
I'm the pinnacle of sword logic
---
I think it's gone. Sorry bro.
---
Here’s a tip that these people are trying to say but dont word it politely: Practice in quickplay, get better, play comp. People that play pvp exclusively comp don’t want a bunch of well of light warlocks using erentils clogging up lobbies and ruining games for the people who have put the time and effort in practicing and getting better. stop complaining and practice.
---
maybe if i constantly move between timelines ill win....
---
Postin for ez checking later
---
Yup
---
Did you find a fix for this?
---
Personal*
---
Can you not grab it from collections?
---
I think “game breaking” is a bit of an exaggeration.
---
The number one steam guide rn is how to make heroics... just shift tab and it’s right there on the summary page under guides
---
"Victory pose" emote
---
I thoroughly enjoy the new one. How is it shit?
---
While OP did lie and said it was autocorrect so people won't question his english knowledge, it's technically true that I'm aware of the misspelling.
---
I think it is actually. Bummer :/
---
Its still good in pvp d2
---
I’m trash at pvp overall so I just never complete those objectives
---
So used to this Nightfall in D1 and the randoms I pull from LFG being so terrible at staying alive. There's a spot toward the cliff on the left side (looking off the cliff) that you can drop off the edge and there's a small ledge you can stay on to be away from all damage. I'd have one Rando stay there while I whittle down the boss. This is cool though!
---
Do higher difficulties. The 920 power one gives two points of progress, plus a better chance at loot.
---
So everyone starts at 750? Is there anyway to play the red war campaign
---
So I’ve only obtained one enhanced mod that wasn’t from the artifact, I dropped enhanced linear fusion targeting in the new nightfall ordeal mode
---
Ghost kabob
---
In the tower, go all the way to the right. See Amanda Holloway in the hanger. She has links to all 3 campaigns.
---
You get bonus points on reset, but it was only up to 180 points. It won't double your score. Unless they changed something this season that I missed.
---
WHAT.
---
Beta player. Didn’t know about this.
---
Thank you, Guardian.
---
You do get some points at reset if you played the previous week but its definitely not double what you earned.
---
Im not entirely sure if you can still play it. Youll have to look maybe on bungie.net
---
KWTD....must have 50,000 clears to get a reply, Hunter with Never Ending Shadow Shot Quiver, Warlock w/ Unlimited Well of Radiance or Titan with an unbreakable Bubble (will boot if not equipped), gear that gives special and heavy ammo at all times..........
---
I don’t think you quite understand. Nothing that drops is higher level than my level. I’m light level 805. All my drops are 750. I can’t get higher level if all I get are lower level drops.
---
Ah yea we're totally looking at raids! But I was just wondering would it be possible for use to be in the same area doing the same activity so we're kiiiinnndda playing together just not on the same team? Like would we be able to back up people on the other team or see the enemies attacking them? I am just wondering because in mmos I've done super parties where we would split into two teams but still look after the other people on the other team and help them complete objectives. I've also had games where you couldn't do that because of instancing, randomly getting moved around channels, or the enemies you saw would only properly show up for you and your teammates.
---
Yeah
---
Also, there is a room in sanctuary where they move after you feed them. I got three in there now (the one that started there plus two I fed)
---
Pfffft why would you even do that one lmao. But yeah it's always been a little buggy. Are you console or PC
---
Ew no.  
---
Maybe if the game was designed around it.
---
Now can other people confirm that this works
---
✌️👌
---
Lets start with light levels. The Soft Cap, or light level where only prime/exotic drops are the way to progress, is 900. The Hard Cap, or max possible light lvl for Shadowkeep, is 1000. This means it's in your best interest to equipt whatever is highest up until 900, then start worrying about the roles each item has.
---
Your build has to be focused on your skills as a player, and what kind of style you're shooting for. Read each perk and imagine it in either PvP, PvE, Gambit, Raids or Overall gaming. Also, if you get a god roll on a sidearm, which you never use, its practically useless in your hands. Stick to what you know or be prepared to force yourself to put some hours into getting used to it/good with it. 
---
Pretty much every video on Youtube will tell you to stick to a specific build or weapon, and my advice is to take other players' advice with many grains of sand (The hypocracy isn't lost on me). Destiny is all about making the class work for you, starting with your skill at the game, mixing it with the class you choose, Subclass, then armour and weapons that all work well together. A Sniper + Shadowshot + Lucky Coyote and Last Word + Golden Gun + Celestial Nighthawk builds are equally good in the right hands, in the right circunstances.
---
3v3 Survival on the right side, look for the red numbers beneath
---
Mine's the new LMG you get at rank 45, thing's a beast.
---
thank you sir that was wholesome :)
---
If you know a player is new, you could always fireteam up and help them out yourself.
---
Gonna be a lot of new Guardians out there.
---
Damn... But yeah, I didn't know that was possible
---
Oh trust me I know.  I used to play Halo semi competitively on PC years ago.  I'm sure I could move over and do just fine.  They all just have a certain arrogance about them, correction "a lot" of them do.  It's just annoying.
---
Ty!
---
DIM is king. Then the bungie app for fireteam. Then little light, because it makes managing duplicate items easy.
---
Actually, the path I took blocks the shrieker fire until right before u land. Watch the path carefully
---
Yikes
---
Holy shit idk why I find this so funny
---
I thought this was going to be a video of the crawling bugs that roam the caves on the moon. Guess I was wrong. Well, this was more interesting.
---
Teach us master
---
all raids are canonically fireteam victories. anything else seems to be the legendary guardian. (who we play) whether the legendary guardian is part of that fireteam is the real question.
---
That gun is insane. The fact that it’s 900 RPM already and then I added increase mag mod to 95 in the magazine. It is ridiculous. Lol
---
I just use the official destiny companion app. Also good for managing your gear
---
Why are 99% of people unable to hold down basic Mexican food
---
Seeing as destiny is supposed to be getting expansions for the next 3-5 years, we have a bit of a wait
---
Going along the wall blocks incoming fire... And just looks cool, lol
---
I’ve seen 60.....to 63? Kackis has a video about armor stars coming out of last wish etc up this morning you should watch
---
I just read up on Gambit after I saw your comment. It sounds dope. Seems like I'm gonna have to get better gear before I play it though
---
I mean apart from the other stats, damage is technically a bit higher because even though the impact is slightly more than half of HH there’s 2x as many rounds per minute and per mag so it balances out.
---
I plaued the full game on xbox and when I started to try mouse and keyboard for the first time I felt like I was disabled or something. At least I can say sorry to everyone in the crucible match :/
---
It's not our fault there's no good black on black shader in the game
---
Except for us Dead Orbit supporters
---
You don’t have to unlock the other forges anymore. They rotate daily from the EDZ map
---
Auto rifles never had a place in the meta before? Did you forget about the days of Uriel’s Gift or have you not experienced that?
---
That doesn’t mean anything to me, smarty Pants.  I ended up there for one reason or another and it sure as hell wasnt the raid
---
Malfeasance is fun for me to use. Just explosions.
---
The in the deep mission? Ive literally done it 4 times
---
It is pretty funny
---
it can be used on any set of armor
---
For one, I do play alone lol, always do. And maybe I just needed somewhere to rant? Sportsmanship isnt a problem with me, but when you're dragging down your team then it's a problem. And if you dont agree that taking a loss due to your team is frustrating, then you're full of it mate
---
Today i Learned, D2Y1 and this is new to me. glad all these unspoken shortcuts and tips&amp;tricks are coming out.
---
The god roll list attached to this whole thread has most of the the stuff to look for. But I guess range on pretty much everything, especially shotguns and hand cannons, handling on snipers, velocity on grenade launchers, stability and range on pulses and auto rifles.
---
Meh, I got a .67 KD, I got recluse and mtop without paying.
---
I do run stacked though...
---
But how do I use it on the armor? I am new to destiny 2 and have no idea how to. The UI seems kind of all over the place imo.
---
*teleports begind u*
---
I've got a clean. It's not very big but people are on every day. It's called house of cards. If I can get you psn I can invite you.
---
Mine keeps crashing also when I get to the boss phase
---
Number*
---
No. The campaign. You have access to the repeatable mission bc youve already done it.
---
I am the little boy. This is my life. But hey, atleast I can have the gun eventually ;(
---
Paragon I think.
---
AKA ship chick
---
when inspecting the armor page press diwn on the d pad or press s to get to the shader/ornament area
---
I'm weak asf hahaha😂😂
---
Nup been nerfed. If you have ricochet W/O range MW is not all that great. Mind you the hand cannon is dumb regardless but ye, I'd go for high cal these days
---
If you open up your inventory and go to your modifications you can unlock it and then apply it to any legendary armor at anytime on multiple sets.
---
You have to use the element (void, ark, solar) that is the same as the elemental burn of the strike for the week. There’s a little circular icon on the vanguard screen that tells you what it is.
---
I usually get focused right as I’m coming down. Plus as a hunter my recovery and resilience is nonexistent. Maybe now with 2.0 Armor I can fix that.
---
Try to get a good set of armor and mods. For weapons, the current meta is Izanagi’s Burden, The Recluse and Wendigo, all of which are attained through kinda long quests
---
Not to sound like an asshole, but it apparently isnt quicker when you have a ban lol
---
I honestly just assumed vets knew this. I found the shortcut by accident shortly after the strike first launched.
---
its still communist but not really
---
Thank you everyone for all the help
---
Doesn't matter, since u alrd on 750 light.
---
Am confusion 
---
Yeah, they’re the eververse ones. However if you do weekly bounties from Zavala, shaxx or the drifter you can earn bright dust which can also buy some stuff in eververse (an ornament form leg armor is on sale this week)
---
This brings back pain.
---
yes but exponentially if you stack broken things
---
That's strange, I checked there already and nothing is shown. I already claimed it from my inventory and everything. Perhaps I missed something.
---
***Get Forsaken***
---
My username
---
Perfect! This is what I was looking for, thanks
---
It is an exotic, it is by no means rare unless you are new or have terrible RNG with exotic drops. That doesn’t make it any better or worse, enjoy the loot and keep going guardian
---
Thank you it worked
---
Gotcha, it has to be legendary.
---
Di molto!
---
Also, tip for thrall yeets : Try to start the finisher from a distance (they have some serious range) so they dont start detonating during the finisher. you can hold the finisher button out of range and the moment they're in range you'll jump straight to them.
---
Full bore, flared Mag, underdog, kill clip with stability mw
---
Same here.  If Bungiie doesn’t fix soon, I’m gone.
---
They’re all Edge Transit! I’ll show myself out.
---
Yep
