Edit it was the cover image for January 2014 announced on December 3rd 2013
---
---
---
I did Redrix or Bygones, one-two punch shotgun or Erentil and Truth or Wardiff.
---
I‚Äôve used them all, and judging by the entirety of the community, yeah, titan exotics suck, OEM is the only decent one
---
Besides no one has even made a logical argument against my points they just deflect and strawman
---
PVE players? Who?
---
It depends on the severity of the nerf in my opinion, they don‚Äôt have to kill them like Breakneck and Redrix
---
I think I get the game mode, but I don't get why you're capping B
---
Like isn't it basically just Control but a powerplay locks the zones for a while?
---
It‚Äôs a one-bang. Once you press it, it releases projectiles and is finished in less than 4 seconds.
---
I managed to get it within 2hrs or so, i thought it would be something i'd never achieve.
---
Oh fun thanks
---
Best way to learn is by doing.
---
That's not broken...that's how it's supposed to work. If the OEM titan got a buff because his teammate got a kill then itd be broken. Counting telesto rounds as kills is broken. Waiting for a buff to wear off when it's supposed too is the way it's supposed to work. Just because you dont like the timing or the buff doesnt make it broken. Broken is when something works in a way it's not meant to work. When they add anything op stop before saying its broke because its probably just strong not broke. If you jumped and got engrams for it that would be a broken mechanic lmfao get it yet?
---
I suck with recluse in crucible but like the IB SMG called hero's burden. Meta weapons have never worked for me in crucible
---
Yes. Solo into a NF, and either farm a room with a ton of enemies, or farm a good world location.
---
It's about 3 hours of non-stop grind...but the gun is worth it.
---
That's part of an adventure
---
This is exactly what I do sometimes, geez, I even just tab and see some quests that I forgot, and start picking the weapons I need. LMAO
---
Damn, flashbacks to listening about how to beat Oryx while jumping back and forth off those disappearing ships
---
Which ones
---
OEM is good in comparison, but I guess we both forgot about Antaeus wards and peregrine?
---
Think it took me about 10 over 3 1/2 days. 0-2100 went super quick. The wins portion took the longest solo queue; I put it off for a long time thinking It was just out of reach. Then when I went for it it was surprisingly easier than I imagined
---
New light
---
Don‚Äôt really play anymore. Is blade barrage still a thing either he arms or did they nerf the shit outta it?
---
I would say aim for 60+ of keeping the gear and 65+ for Masterworking it.
---
90% hunters I‚Äôve met were just crouching with shotguns around the corners. Majority play hunter only for its looks and have no clue how to utilize all hunter has to offer.
---
*cries in Riven*
---
Blade barrage is not a bad super there are just better options for dps. Its still great in pvp (blade barrage).
---
They have the normal version which is 34 o believe.
---
So fucking true!!
---
Which grenade are you running?
---
I'm this way too. It's all about risk assessment. I'd rather bank motes quicker than wait and try to send a blocker
---
I don't get it.  Are you saying the color changes aren't random like Heroic public events?
---
How do I get more power ammo? I can go through entire strikes without any appearing. Doing any quest involving them is a huge pain.
---
It's an extra super that comes with the forsaken expansion for hunters.
---
Did you win?
---
I see, that‚Äôs really great. Good job!
---
Peregrine is absolutely useless, unless you‚Äôre meming, in a shotgun meta and the fact you need your shoulder charge up, anteaus wards aren‚Äôt consistent and don‚Äôt allow you to fight while using them
---
If you‚Äôre trying to win you won‚Äôt use them
---
The reason OEM is good is because it‚Äôs consistently useful
---
That makes sense, thanks
---
Laughs in Ryan Haywood.
---
Every Waking Moment. Rolls: Hammer forged barrel, richochet rounds, hip fire grip, and demolitionist.
---
Anyhow it should not match you into the game if there is only 1 minute left no matter what. Same shit is happening constantly in gambit and gambit prime matches as well.
---
And this is why I appreciate this sub
---
99% of Everything is solo content. The raid is literally the only thing that's not.
---
But that's impossible!
---
way more invested in the lore / characters of destiny and i think the gunplay feels a bit better and overall more to do 
---
not bashing on borderlands though, love those games to death but i prefer destiny for a couple of reasons
---
It's the adventure called Invitation from the Emperor. It was the first hint we got about Calus and he was the leader of the Cabal. Cool little adventure lore wise.
---
What power level are you?
---
We've been downvoted lol
---
Fuckin¬¥ hate Titans
---
literally this is control any time you play it
---
You are making my point more clear, it‚Äôs end game gear, you should have a leveled character, you do bounties, bounties are pinnacle, pinnacle gear is powerful if you‚Äôre leveled. 
---
Under leveled people can stick to regular pvp until they‚Äôre leveled enough for iron banner.
---
To  be honest i only really use recluse for PvE it makes things so much easier, apparently the Subjunctive is pretty decent with the right rolls.
---
Yeah sorry to everyone I played with. I used you all so I can complete my pinnacles. I was never playing to win.
---
Thank you. I have about 1500 gunsmith parts so ill try Banshee then ill spam gambit.
---
It's as much Mythoclast as Deathbringer is GHorn.

I can‚Äôt look at this image the same way since I found out that watering is a sign of severe eye infection in the cat. Poor guy ‚òπÔ∏è

---
I always go top. The longer tether works easier and better than the quiver in my opinion and the clutch dodge invis saved me a couple times.
---
Also seeing chests/resources on the radar is so damn convenient.
---
That's not my question. Why do robots have them?
---
Very amazing hand cannon I suggest Ace of spades over it tho
---
I'm scared to try Gambit. There's no tutorial anywhere in game, and all the tutorials I find online are explaining Gambit Prime but assuming you already know Gambit. I've played enough Dota 2 to experience the singular displeasure of ruining a game for 4 strangers and not even understanding what you did, so, no thanks.
---
There is also a static roll in your collections, but it‚Äôs probably worse.
---
Because people like boobs?
---
Hop into crucible, load heavy ammo and start scaring the shit out of people.
---
Sex appeal I guess. Plus, on a robotic figure, what besides body shape actually gives away if they're "male" or "female"
---
Nobody on PC responds to me on mic or text :(

OP stole my meme, just a head‚Äôs up if that bothers you.

The knives floating independant of the hand and not being nestled between the fingers is the only thing that's killing this gor me. I wish I didn't see it but now I can't not see it

This is what I‚Äôm saying. And I don‚Äôt want to re-dye every piece of gear I get, I‚Äôm never going to want to use different shaders on different pieces, I don‚Äôt want to worry about whether I‚Äôm going to keep a piece long enough to make dying worth it, there are just so many problems with it. If they want to sell shaders in the cash shop, fine, but fuck this current model.
---
Middle right. Its just called survival now and it has a little solo queue next to it i think called freelancer

You have been selected for termination, do not resist.

Because that‚Äôs how you tell the male and female exos apart. That would be like asking a guy why he has a penisüòÇ

---
You should give Sweet Buisness a try
---
Why do they have gender at all? Presumably, in universe, they were to resemble humans. Unless the lore says otherwise it's just that simple. They were made to look like humans.
---
I think that exos are meant to resemble humans as much as they can without coating a skeleton in fake skin lol, thus the robotic breasts.
---
Thank you. Appreciate that actually.
---
Insert * oh shit* sound effect
---
You want normal armour as ornaments for exotics?
---
Effectively making it impossible for people in pvp to tell what is being worn?

I'm hearing more and more stories of Guardians that haven't and wouldn't touch comp with a 20 foot pole hopping in this season and literally knocking Recluse out in hours from square zero.

Something is happening to the players and I'm unsure how to feel about it.

Oh that's a shame! But ty anyways :)

Yeah, worse than mine, so I'll have to deal with it :P

Yeah...Ty anyways :)

Oof

same thoooo
---
Your tears are delicious.
---
Thanks for the advise. I figured that out after playing a couple matches, it does help. Played tonight with a friend and actually won two matches! Made it to the next level (Legendary?) and I‚Äôll try again later. I know that 5 seconds after I get it Bungo is going to nerf it anyway, but that‚Äôs ok. I never earned gjallahorn either, bought it from Xur and felt shame.
---
Whichever two are closest to each other. Always covering those two and heavy. It's a busy life when you got the big brains
---
They work really well when used against large groups of ads
---
It‚Äôs more lack of FPS than anything else
---
It's the only sniper with higher base aim assist than Supremacy. If I were to put a Targeting Adjuster on my Supremacy, it would be higher.
---
Does light affect melee dmg in pvp? As far as I know hunters dont have dmg boosted melees that titans get, but I am getting one shot by them. This is on my 800 light hunter
---
Also, I have a 800 light Blast Furnace with Outlaw and Kill clip. I read this is near "god roll", so should I infuse it to 900 or is it easy to roll a better one?

Got it a few hours ago, I pretty much accepted I'd never hit fabled in the previous seasons. Highest I could get in a full clan stack was 1,750.
---
But this season is a whole lot easier to solo. Every second game was versing some 4,400 glory powerhouse even when I was only 600 glory, but I got after about three hours of constant grinding.
---
I don‚Äôt know.
---
Maybe the game let you go out but won‚Äôt let you come back.
---
Oof, thanks for pointing that out
---
If you can once your gear is 950. Otherwise just do it
---
Kingpin is an OEM titan with recluse in crucible
---
If he's on PC he's using one of those
---
Like it or not...
---
So you‚Äôre asking to make all classes and subclasses carry thesame perks? Because its a combination of mods and perks from a super subclass.. if you don‚Äôt like it, switch over to titan then. Or stop getting in melee range. Titans are after all, Punch Masters.

Yo i wanna join that server what de link?

Maybe its just me; I really try and not let me teammates down.

Being the last guardian honestly resonates that R6 "Friendly laat operator standing" kind of anxiety with me.

I understand your opinion but have to disagree.  Most (all but the previous seasons Iron Banner Armors) of the armor sets in the game are now acquirable as Armor 2.0 pieces.  I get that the grind for the perfect roll on a piece of armor you really want to wear can be maddening but we're only through 3 weeks of this new system.  If you got armor with all of the right stat rolls and elemental affinity for the perks you want and could just put an ornament of any other armor set on it you'd have no armor to chase for potentially the next 49 weeks (and thats assuming that the system changes again with next years "big" content release).  Its a looter shooter.  Grind is the game.  I'm what I'd call a semi-casual player, I play less than the real sweats and streamers but more than my wife would like, and frankly I understand that because I can't just straight up "no life" Destiny indefinitely I may never find the perfect rolled armor.  As long as what I want to wear lets me put the perks on that I'll want to run for a while thats all that really matters to me at this point.
---
If you mean the vex transponder for the Zero Hour/Outbreak quest then it doesn't drop, you have to go to a certain location on Titan and pick it up.
---
Edit: mistook it for the fallen transponder, nevermind what I wrote.
---
I've been playing since day one, and even long term players can make that mistake far too often lol. plus at least the new guys actually ask questions so they can learn and improve their skills, longer term players are set in their ways smh.
---
Coincidentally I changed my Steam ID to Shaxx‚Äôs Illegitimate Child a few days ago.
---
Bruh, shoot them a few times and take their shields down a little then punch them.  Duh.
---
TLW is bae. As for non exotics I'm still trying to get a good roll. I've heard Duke 44 and Better Devils is good.
---
That one is fallen, I think he means the black armory one
---
"Do not think of the Crucible as improving yourself, but rather improving each other." - Lord Shaxx.
---
Or something like that goes the quote. Flavour text on a crucible item I saw once iirc, it's been a while.
---
theyre getting nerfed soon
---
It‚Äôs because you didn‚Äôt slide up the stairs.
---
Fr tho i play all classes and every time i hop on my titan the amount of angry ass people raging at me in my messages in crucible is insane, I don‚Äôt even use OEM or bottom tree striker lmao
---
I'm currently running a Asus 1070 turbo. But my experience with Nvidia specifically when it comes to drivers work a lot better that AMD driver's for the most part.
---
Yes, yes we do.
---
Teach me your ways, master.
---
What are the different goals?  I know that one balcony thing on the bridge connecting Zavala and Shaxx is one of them, but I don't know the rest.
---
Now there. The subject gets tricky. People would recommend adaptive frames or precision frame. But Me personally I love aggressive frame hand cannons. Mostly because all aggressive frame weapons come with the intrinsic high caliber perk. I was lucky enough to to found a masterworked Duke Mk 44 with range masterwork perk, piercing rounds, outlaw and rampage. Its been doing wonders for me. Aggressive frame are slow firing mind you, but once you get the hang of its recoil patterns. You'll be headshoting like a pro. Aside from aggressive frames. I would also recommend a precision frame like the trust hand cannon if aggressive is too much for you.
---
Yeah I have a decent amount of hours in R6 and I always told myself that I‚Äôm probably going to die and would actually come to expect it so my heart wouldn‚Äôt race and then I was actually able to clutch more bc I was calm. R6 actually helped me overcome that racing heart feeling
---
Titan itself is not a crutch my friend.  Play what you like to play.  I don't use OEM cause I don't like it.  It's pretty cheapo.  I play thundercrash or bubble over striker because I enjoy them more.  But some people want to win and will use whatever it takes.  Do what you want and ignore the hate mail brother.
---
The hunter at the end: "yoink mine now"

[deleted]
---
In the Outskirts and the Gultch in the EDZ or in the Hollows and Artifacts Edge on Nessus there spawns a Mini-Boss occasionally with a shield and shield drones around it. Destroy the drones to down the shield and then kill the thing. After that there are chests also with shield around them, down the shield and open the chest for a weapon core.
---
I do this often by nuking the boss at first to get them making the cryo mist. Then it takes some twinkletoes action to get to the vents, shotty them open and throw the core at the boss. Do this x3 and you've made it heroic solo.
---
Ah, memories brother, memories of grinding for the recluse.
---
Damn, you're right. Mixed them up lol
---
I had to do a powerpoint presentation so I made it on lootboxes. To a class of non-gamers. It was the most popular presentation and people had lots of questions after because many of them had kids and they realized their kids might get sucked into that.
---
Just because people don't play games doesn't mean they aren't interested.
---
This just happened to me
---
thank you, how often do they spawn
---
Those overload rounds are pretty damn powerful too. Sadly you have to wear out that poor little drang to get that many rounds in sturm.
---
God damn it Shaxx.
---
Could i get the name of your armor? It looks pretty cool! Most i've seen are meh in design
---
Do you have VSS option on your headphones or through your own sound settings of the computer itself? (When I plug in headphones into my pc, it gives me room options, like old school sound blaster set up)

Truth is my best friend in Gambit Prime. I run sniper,gnawing hunger,truth. Voidlock. Whenever i hear invader on the field,i use truth to OHK that mofo. Been working wonders since most invaders run machine guns and all i have to do is peek aim for a split second,fire and forget,boom goes the invader.

Are they tho?

Important point for the 2070 super.  I think I‚Äôve made up my mind
---
Who says I have to have something to chase? I‚Äôm perfectly happy running crucible, strikes, etc and not having to worry about loot
---
Just because the system is there doesn‚Äôt mean you have to use it. If you want to grind out for the perfect item with the right stats and the right looks, then don‚Äôt use the proposed ornament system
---
Ye but bow does more dmg than celes and you deal around the amount of dmg izanagi does, plus you giving teammates damage buff
---
Dont die? Kill the invader before he kills you?
---
Idk,kinetic smg isn't really a big thing right now,mostly due to the dominance of recluse.
---
Edit: i do have the exit strategy, been sitting in my vault with 0 kills on it...
---
Might just be me but I find that hunters w/arcstrider are also really common and annoying, but I‚Äôm in a really low rank without recluse so what do I know lol
---
I only ever play middle tree
---
Haha Check my profile, drop a follow to if you want. Theres always more to come!

Me af but I'm actually tired and need sleep instead of not being that good

I believe that's a nebula.

Apparently all we‚Äôve been fighting are the equivalent of farmers and workers. We have yet to see the true warriors the vex have to offer.

Nvidia GT940M. I assume i'm not able to use ReLive while using nvidia card.
---
If you have OEM and a solid handcannon or pulse you can solo recluse in like a day.
---
I don‚Äôt get it, maybe because I haven‚Äôt finished the story yet
---
But even the sight is basically the same.
---
how do you get mida now? same way as before, through quests?
---
I don't even play hunter, but from the perspective of a warlock Titan is magnitudes more threatening with OEM than a hunter could ever be.
---
If I remember correcrly once they're done and not claimed the timer is not on the bounty anymore so you can keep them.
---
I‚Äôm dying over here in class. DGAF what people think of me right now
---
How are you supposed to get an accurate shot of with a sniper when they flinch you as soon as you could possibly see them because they have wall hacks and therefore an instantaneous reaction time?
---
Truly the passing of a titan

Yo this is my clan, what's up fellas

_"You know. Arms and eyes aren't the only thing the Fallen got 4 of..._ **TRANSMAT FIRING"**
---
They only get wallhacks if you shoot them. Hit a surprise headshot and you don‚Äôt need to worry about flinch.
---
You don‚Äôt purchase guns with Silver. What you see in the store are ornaments that you use to change the appearance of certain weapons.
---
Titan Peregrine Greaves Exploit:
---
Requirements:
---
-Titan with shoulder charger
---
(Arc top, Void bottom or Solar top)
---
I found arc is strongest with thunder coil mod
---
-Shotgun with one-two punch perk so last man standing
---
-(Optional) Monte Carlo for quick melee abilty returns
---
How to use:
---
Run up to enemy nd jump in the air then w/o ads'ing shoot ur shotgun then instantly shoulder charge
---
Enjoy 1 shotting strike bosses guardian!
---
It's the 4th impact.
---
So if you don't immedielty oneshot the enemy before they react to you they deserve to have wall hacks on you to punish you for missing (or hitting a shot that doesn't kill)?
---
i found him i needed to get the killshot
---
So back before the free-to-play happened, you started a story-line called "The Red War". Nothing else was really available. After that, Curse of Osiris story was released, then Warmind, then Forsaken, now Shadowkeep. You used to start at level 1. Now with "New Light" the free-to-play stuff, they start you at 750 and EVERYTHING is unlocked as if you already beat the game previously. This was to open the game up to new players so they didn't have to grind through the entire game and work their way up over years of arduous content just to be apart of current events.
---
That's fine and all EXCEPT, where they really messed up is they gave these New Light players ZERO DIRECTION. I'm a New Light player and had no fucking idea what the main story was called, what the DLCs were called, who anyone was. My first mission I accidentally was doing Forsaken DLC and was in the same boat as you. 
---
They need to organize the quest screen into chapters and also give you some direction on where to start the quests. They give you so much direction inside the missions but outside them seems like they make you rely on google. 
---
Also, if you're clicking on the Strikes playlist you will be forced into content you haven't gotten to yet. So, don't do that unless you don't care.
---
Ah... I see you are a hunter of talent(in other word, dont use BB that much).
---
Probably from Hawthorne, I think Gambit Prime weapons are in the pool for the Clan Gambit rewards
---
I played Javelin against 3 striker Titans and 2 OEMs. Utterly destroyed them and I am still riding that high
---
What were you grinding
---
Especially on PC, where you can flick the shot across half the screen, painting everything in purple AOE death balls. 
---
It's really hard to lose in Gambit with the telesto equipped.
---
Some tips to kill Minotaurs easier?
---
Sounds like "Using it as a crutch" but with extra steps
---
Man I see this a lot lately. I did countless forges trying to get it to drop for weeks. I would have way rather had a set quest for it even if it takes 5vweeks.
---
It's not as bad as shitposting though.
---
Extended mag is the better perk choice here
---
While lookin like a snack
---
Lol your terrible, I'm loving Arc staff because in pve I can melee to charge a dodge and dodge to charge a melee so I roll around all day
---
i got coldheart the other day and after using it for a while i do not see what the point of trace rifles is, it uses special ammo which it burns through very quickly and doesnt seem to down enemies any faster than some auto rifles i have.  whats the point of them?  what do they do thats unique/useful/good?
---
With such limited methods of approach you may as well play Overwatch. Gimping your choices by such a degree causes staleness. It says a lot if COD has more customizability than Destiny does now.
---
Google it and get a guide up
---
I only use bottom tree striker for the neutral game. I dont care about the super, I even go some games without using it, so the nerf doesn‚Äôt really affect me lol
---
Destiny isn't pay to win, unfortunately. You can only buy cosmetic stuff with real money.
---
Haha! Tangled Web is the new Edge Transit.
---
They're not talking to you..
---
It's definitely that shader. I have it. It's amazing.
---
That‚Äôs why I love Stormcaller, I can charge into a group, use landfall and then continue to clear out everyone
---
not really. rift when you die is like putting a condom on a baby. at that point it's already too late. transversives and orphidia spathes are brilliant for pvp, then you have class specifics like phoenix protocol, wings of sacred dawn, sunbracers, nazarec's sin and geomags which are all at least pretty useful (they're all above average). then u have meme exotics like contraverse hold that are admittedly fun, and improve your stats somewhat, but that's it. hope this helps.
---
also phoenix protocol is only good if you have a team that knows at least a bit what they're doing since you either need people to stand in your well or get a lot of kills on your own for it to pull it's weight. and teamwork is surprisingly rare for some reason.
---
also lunarfactions used to be really good, but now they're absolute trash. hold on to them still, though, since they might get buffed/ reworked again someday.
---
Oil reserves
---
Haha I got it from a carry üëâüëâ
---
Yup, I totally agree. Plus if they have this type of setup, then Arcstrider mains would ignore the disorienting blow thing. They would pair focused breathing and combination blow. In my opinion, that‚Äôs WAAAYYY too op. Even in PVP or PVE, it would abolish disorienting blows status, to the point where Bungie might as well remove it. We could make a HUGE debate over this. But this is just my opinion and thoughts. 
---
P.S. I respect OP‚Äôs thoughts about this, and how it‚Äôs mostly a debate on PVE not PVP.
---
High tier exotic for pvp right now, especially if you pair it with the thundercoil artifact mod on your mark. Makes a great choice for an aggressive shotgun playstyle.
---
I tried but i only get youtube videos for it.
---
Nice
---
It is either OEM or Chromatic Fire
---
Oh wait, those aren‚Äôt weapons
---
WORTH IT!
---
Love this. Do you use the geomag stabilizer boots, too? I LOVE those boots for gambit! Absolutely melts the boss
---
all those headshots üò≠
---
omg finally. thx
---
Warlock Master race.
---
I‚Äôve been trying to solo that mission for ages.
---
Very impressive
---
ah yes the good ole bois. forgot about them since i had them already. but trust me you're gonna see a nerf there soon.
---
Finished it with my brother the other night 20 seconds to spare.
---
But you miss the point. I can not one punch anyone as a warlock, not even the hunter. How is that even balanced or fair?
---
If they could just have both it would be great. Have the current three trees for a ‚Äúquick build‚Äù and have the old setup for an ‚Äúadvanced build‚Äù right next to it. It doesn‚Äôt have to be complicated but it would be really nice to pick and choose which perks and abilities I want.
---
I prefer drifter over shaxx because at least then I‚Äôm not the one shit talking myself
---
Son of a bitch... I hadn't looked at ghost perks since D2 launch and didn't even realize that existed. :(
---
Can do GOS easily
---
Lmao hi every body dr drifter here
---
r/warlocksriseup
---
Ayyyyye!
---
Like being able to select your agility, recovery, and strength, I know most players detest the armor system determining the stats of those 3 at the moment. Overall just more attention to PvE, like what was intended from the beginning.
---
No, I'm asking to let other classes be able to have perks to do the same. How do you not get the disadvantage it puts 66% of the other classes? Just make other classes be able to do it, or better yet, have everyone not be able to do it. A melee kill should only be after the target is already wounded.
---
Template please
---
Not all of us had it at the time, but it still ended up working!
---
I really had to sound rude, I'm not trying to be, but maybe you're not quite up to scratch on precision kill ratios for it to be viable. I usually have approximately 30% precision kill ratio when using scatter load outs and 60% on precision loadouts, I usually have about 60% of team kills in a 3 man team and I find that Celestial chargers REALLY quick. I would use it 3-5 times per strike depending on the strike length and run speed.
---
I would like to add I‚Äôm a New Light player so this was very painful... looking at you OEM players
---
Karma said hello.
---
To be fair, that walker is just a red bar and very weak compare to most walkers encountered in the game, however I can confirm that on 920 Ordeal last weeks, I could one shot Hashladun in a warlock well.
---
Given this argument, you prove my point. They should have to also shoot someone before the melee.
---
I don‚Äôt see anyone use Skullfort anymore I remember when I had a full and they only use there shoulder charge the whole game and won like that
---
Please don't. Having to think about the pros and cons of each subclass is much better than just picking and choosing between the best super, grenade, mele, and general perks to lock on and never swap off of.
---
Okay but it‚Äôs usable by every warlock with nezarac‚Äôs sin.
---
Warlocks are the worst at the moment
---
Wish I could see the look on the other teams faces when you all melted that boss.
---
I am worlock maim can 1v1 a recluse montaintop hunter and win
---
Please don't do this, seeing that loadout screen makes me feel sick. What a mess.
---
Imagine having nightstalker smoke invisibility grenade with the spectral blades see through walls perk.  Now throw in Monte Carlo and Graviton Forfeit, you've got yourself a permanently invisible flanker that never shows up on radar.
---
This is why we don't want customization.  The subclass that had lots of invisibility but minor buffs to invisibility shouldn't mix with the class that has major buffs to invisibility but very limited ways to go invisible.  Imagine knockout thunder coil titans with death from above.
---
When you have to balance perks with the expectation that they'll be used with other perks, you can't afford to make any of them powerful in unique ways.  You have to limit them and make them more generic.  Otherwise you'll have stupid powerful builds that give the best of all worlds.
---
The reason that subclasses can have some incredibly powerful perks right now is because they're sitting on top of significantly less powerful perks.
---
Obviously you‚Äôve never been killed by a team mate that got close to you with an active lightning chain charged
---
No problem it's an easy mistake to make, happens to me from time to time too
---
In crucible it is toxic
---
... recluse nerf... laughs in wizened rebuke.
---
Where do I find enemy teams who willingly walk directly into an enemy sniper they can literally see beforehand through a freaking window.  Where are they?
---
The problem right now is that the jumps, the grenades, and the special are free choices and there‚Äôs usually a most popular that holds true to the meta. The jumps need some adjustment. The grenades need some balance tuning. The specials need more defining attributes that make the choice less about optimal and more about play style.
---
Freeeeeeeeeeeee karma!!!!!!!!!
---
You can buy a bygones after a certain rank from the drifter, check with him and you'll see what you need to buy it. 
---
As far as gambit vs gambit prime goes you can play either one to increase your gambit rank. However you can only do gambit prime bounties in gambit prime but regular gambit bounties can be done in gambit prime as well. Prime matches tend to be a bit faster and you can use the armor from the reckoning to get unique benefits while in prime. 
---
As a final note you can also get gambit prime weapons from gambit prime as a reward after each match. And remember: bank those motes!
---
K lol
---
I have the same problem as your friend. My titan and warlock which I played with previously in Destiny 2 did not get the Arsenal of Oddities quest. My Hunter which I never used in Destiny 2 (used it in 1 and decided I didn't care about a hunter for 2) was able to get the quest. The difference between the titan/warlock and the hunter was that the hunter got 'discover' quests for all the planets, being a "new" character on my account. When I talked to Ana Bray on Mars as part of the 'discover Mars' quest I was sent to Banshee where he gave me the Arsenal of Oddities quest.
---
TLDR: characters I had played with on destiny 2 prior to New Light couldn't get the 'discover planet' quests, so the Arsenal of Oddities couldn't follow the 'discover Mars' quest per usual
---
I still haven't found a fix to this for my titan and warlock.
---
When it first dropped in vault of glass it was an arc primary, then later in destiny 1 (around year 3 i believe) they did away with elemental primaries. So no, it was originally designed and in the game as an arc primary for about 2 years.
---
*Rolls eyes* guess I'm the only person who doesn't like getting killed by panic supers and one hit kill melee attacks.
---
one of my fav weapons to use with titan in combo with AWR. It kinda makes you feel like an AA cannon
---
Yeah I didn't get my thorn until then and by then it was nowhere near as good.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
TLW was my counter to thorn and was a bit riskier in-your-face style of gun
---
Unless you're playing in a fireteam that would only make things worse for you...
---
That‚Äôs around my light when I ran this. I know it purposely lowers your light for the mission but that shouldn‚Äôt really affect you too much. Were you doing literally no damage or little damage?
---
He always say ‚Äútalk to your team‚Äù in the beginning but never happens ...
---
This is what you show guitar newbs when they start. It's the frets for smoke on the water\^\^ a simple version obviously
---
No u
---
Was shit in PVP though, which is why comparing  to recluse is weird
---
It makes your life easier, but I wouldn't waste a rocket on a regular shielded enemy in a nightfall. Be on the lookout for a strike modifier called match game, if it's active any element that doesn't match the shield of an enemy will do very little damage. We're talking about a ton of magazines just for one shield.
---
You're right, I would love seeing the same cookie cutter build on every single person! No matter how big your hate boner is for PvP in Destiny, it exists so they HAVE to keep it in mind when balancing. A system like this would completely ruin pvp content.
---
I've whiffed my share of nighthawk shots tbh but there aren't many things that do that much at once
---
Haha stupit titans
---
I really do feel like it‚Äôs the strongest class in PvP right now with the shoulder charge and melee, and the jump really.
---
Thank you my fellow superior classed br√∂ther
---
No been grinding for recluse so just that and iron banner, can't imagine it would be any different though
---
Do what? If any armor piece could look like any other armor piece in the game, it would eliminate a lot of grind for it and discourage players from buying Eververse sets (unless they are absolutely sick). Right now you can either find the look you want, grind for the right drop (elemental affinity + stats) or pay for some new sets. And I am okay with that.
---
The Vex were roombas all along.  That's the whole point of the story, duh.
---
That would just be Rampage then, right?
---
I actually despise how it works. Like the idea is cool but the fact that you can invade every fucking like 2 seconds with a sniper our scout rifle and just peak people from across the map makes it obnoxious. The time between portals should be way longer, like you shouldn‚Äôt be able to invade more than 5 times a match
---
If you‚Äôre brand new and wanting to experience the story I‚Äôd recommend going to the Tower (centre near top of screen) and going to the Hanger to find Amanda Holliday because she now has all the storyline missions available to play through.
---
Other than that it‚Äôs pretty much a free roam to do whatever you want, although remember to pick up bounties from people for locations or activities for the best progress &amp; rewards.
---
I.e. for Strikes see Zavala, Crucible see Shaxx, Gambit see the Drifter, general weapon calibration (gives you enhancement cores that you‚Äôll want to save up for later game) Banshee - they‚Äôre all in the Tower too.
---
Every planet has a vendor who also has bounties which reward planetary materials &amp; XP as well.
---
That last part. Or once you invade there has to be a cool down period before you can invade again.
---
omg that's sick
---
You will see a message that says "a forge saboteur appears".
---
Never bro I'm a toaster boy FL
---
Cool thx, looks like raids are not just for powerful but also good looking gear
---
I'm pepega who didnt know killing champions boosts mission reward and they didn't really drop loot to my dozens of runs so I skipped them and literally no one said anything to me. My friend didn't know either til he randomly found/heard someone saying to kill all champions for better loot and then he told me and I facepalmed pretty hard. Explained alot of people who disconnected from matches with me ;(
---
You say nothing can stop this, but it's wrong. If they had a -1 penalty, it would suffice.
---
I actually DID clean it before I took this picture.  It was waaaaaaay worse before!
---
That's definitely not the case anymore. A simple -1 would be a perfect balance.
---
This scene right here. This scene is when I realized I found my new favorite game.
---
It's shopped, I see the pixels
---
He's got that "white guy wearing sunglasses in his car as a twitter pic" energy.
---
That's not true either. There have been plenty of times where I've dropped a person in a super against the odds OR simple out-maneuvered them around the map. In fact, kiting supers seems to be more effective than jumping off the map.
---
^ but also, Firefly did solar damage due to how it functioned back in the day iirc. I may be wrong with that, but it always seemed to do well against solar shields. Fatebringer really was a frankenstein's monster of amazing perks
---
There are 3 different things: cross-save, cross-play and cross-pay. I completely agree that it's only Bungie's business decision not to support cross-pay, because there are no technical obstacles to it. How difficult would it be to implement it? One function call to the login server to check what seasons are bought.
---
Why didn't they implement it already? My guess is because of the uncertainty after the split with Activision.
---
I mentioned Stadia as an analogy to Netflix. Stadia isn't interesting for me personally. I don't have multiple devices, I'm a mono gamer with a girlfriend and we tend to play the same game over longer periods of time.
---
To be fair, you need roughly 7-10 minutes for a level on moon if you spam the bounties. It's just a smart focus farm.
---
I mean, I definitely wouldn't take shoulder charge on my Titan. I'd take the hammer throw from middle tree solar, because it's fun as hell.
---
So, what you're saying is that we should have the use exotics to make our class abilities effective? While Warlocks and Titans run around with potent all-round defensive abilities?
---
The weapons are the same for every class, btw. 
---
Warlock has the best abilities and the worst jump. 
---
Hunters have the easiest jump and the worst abilities. 
---
Titan are right in the middle. 
---
Try them all, it often comes down to the subclasses and super abilities that come with it.
---
More like just terrible management and direction.
---
You know there‚Äôs a way to do it without giving us the option to use everything all at once right?
---
I like it for when I know I will be facing a lot of trash mobs.
---
Weapons are the same across all characters &amp; as for armour do you mean exotics with unique perks or general armour become armour wise generally any class can have any armour set-up or points &amp; mods.
---
Easiest one for most people to learn is generally Hunter since it‚Äôs similar to playing most shooter like games with some extra abilities thrown in whereas Titans &amp; Warlocks can be more challenging to adjust to for beginners it seems.
---
So stack up. You solo in a team co-op mode, it ain‚Äôt gonna go so good.
---
Is divinity a random drop or guarrenteed when doing all steps?
---
Any tips on how to get better at pvp I fuckin suck man
---
No I'm saying it's a nice pair g, I run Hunter myself. Im just coping with the disadvantage
---
So I have managed to sort it out. I set up a new profile on my PS4 and logged into my girlfriend's account that has destiny. I loaded destiny 2 up on her profile and played on her account, I then logged out and back in to my account and when I got to the ship it was there üòÅ I'm not happily playing through but I do get the dc'd from time to time but when I go back in it's fine
---
Me- Absolutely not. 
---
Scrub - why? Its so good. 
---
Me- titans would absolutely always have a shoulder charge. Warlocks would absolutely always have a chargable nade. Hunters would be slightly better off ( they dont need a buff in any way. )
---
Scrub- reeeeeee. I want to play my way
---
Me- then go play wow.
---
Me- there should always be a downside to each build. It challenges people to play the game and it not be super easy. This set up would create far less diversity.
---
Except anthem wad what it was because the devs sat on their ass for 5 years out of the 6 years of development time, kept delaying their work instead of doing anything whatsoever but asking for money from ea, ea got tired and forced them to launch on their deadline, which resulted in a hot mess that cannot be called a game demo even. 
---
Anthem's flop was everything but because there was no medium for sweats to run around and tbag each other.
---
So get a fireteam.
---
I have book class next week and since I haven‚Äôt been reading anything, I‚Äôm just gonna print the Book of Sorrow and bring that in
---
Nope not yet
---
Did you wear vex season armor or moon armor ?
---
Are you referring to the seasonal artifact mod unlocks? If so, those can be applied to your weapons after unlocking them.
---
So i can't get it, right?
---
I swear to god this exact same thing happened to me&amp;my friends in our 8th or 9th run.
---
For same weird reason we kept wiping during gauntlet, that took an hour or so.
---
Then we kept messing up callouts for calus.
---
Wasn't a good day.
---
It‚Äôs actually not entirely broken. It counts the Dreambane armour as the seasonal armour and gives you progress for using that. It‚Äôs very odd and most likely unintentional but at least it‚Äôs still obtainable and easy.
---
Looks like Dawnblade is spiderman lol
---
Warlock jump can be good in pvp as well. It doesn't necessarily make you sluggish, it just feels that way. I can hit hunters as easily as warlocks. It's not easy to hit a good warlock.
---
Whenever I hear an enemy firing this gun shivers run down my spine
---
I am paranoid, I lock valuable items the moment I get them.
---
&gt; synthoceps gauntlets
---
is this a random drop or behind some quest? .. or eververse =.=
---
It's funny how true it is, I myself am the one on the right most of the time when it comes to playing LoL.
---
Me trying to do bounties on the fly
---
It has nothing to do with the energy level, it‚Äôs the season pass armor itself. On all three of my characters I‚Äôve had the same energy level for the armor and still had to use an upgrade module. But for any other armor peace that are similar in energy all I had to do was spend glimmer. (Just a bug, hopefully Bungo fixes it
---
Yep, I got all possible essences right now, I was asking how to farm effectively requirement "activities completed 0-100%"
---
I just want obsidian black. God that helmet was amazing in PvE.
---
No, from now on we call it
---
#HALCON MASK
---
I‚Äôm not a warlock but still cool
---
\[dramatic music intensifies\]
---
I recommend grabbing all the mounties from zavala, shaxx, gunsmith, and gambit and just bang those out; then do whatever gives you legendary gear. You can 950 light before the reset if you play enough/make a new char the same class after you finish all the powerful rewards on the first one.
---
Random drop
---
And that's with only X3 primeval slayer, holy crap
---
She doesn‚Äôt sell the key mold in the isanagi‚Äôs burden questline.
---
That's hilarious. How is a titan not more powerful?
---
Yes they have powerful aspects but titans are OP as fuck.
---
Its now a random word drop like most other exotics in the game. It just up to RNG now for you to find your thunderlord.
---
DISGUSTAENG
---
Hunters do have the best mobility
---
I am speechless
---
Yeah its really sad i remember always being the only warlock in a raid when i was a warlock main.
---
Did you know you can proc the lightning AoE if you sprint then throw middle tree solar's hammer? The lightning blast hits wherever the hammer lands, so much fun
---
Looks amazing! Excellent work
---
Yeah its absurd compared to super kills and melee kills. I recommend playing hunter with lucky raspberry for it though.
---
Didn't even realize I completed the triumph till randomly looking today lol
---
Ah yes, you're under leveled so don't do the thing that gives you higher level gear until you have higher level gear!
---
You're a genius.
---
I would love this for all classes
---
Its even worse in PvE. Its possibly even better in PvE from recluse.
---
No
---
Yeah, slowva bomb is universal.
---
Well, allow me to welcome you to the world of Destiny 2 and wish you luck in your adventures!
---
If you chose Warlock, then you'll likely have a blast yeeting Nova Bombs and Firing Lazer Lightning! It's truly an experience like no other.
---
If you hurt a Titan with OEM they can see you through walls for 8 seconds, they get bonus damage against you and if they kill you they start healing and get an overshield. The effect has no cooldown or limit to how often it can proc.
---
Until you meet a OEM titan that [delete]  you lol jk welcome new lighter
---
Got it within an hour of gameplay, had a good fireteam and had a streak of about 15 wins in a row.. 
---
Not difficult to get anymore, but it's not overpowering in pvp either. No reason to nerf it
---
Exit strategy isn't bad, and it's Kinetic which I prefer... But recluse definitely outguns it in a 1v1
---
Wouldnt a warlock with 100 discipline and crown of tempest be better? Especially while doing the vex offensive and invasions.
---
It's only Oryx, who drops it
---
In the God Roll Spreadsheet, Love and Death from the Dreambane lists Proximity Grenades instead of Spike Grenades. Is there a reason proximity nades are better than spike nades on console or is this just a small error?
---
Yeah that would be dumb. Just take about 2 seconds off the effect and make it just gradually heal until your health is full, then charge up the overshield at about the rate that a healing rift charges an overshield. I think that'd keep it's utility but make it feasible to take on an OEM that just won a 1v1
---
Should have been a ‚ÄúWe Ran Out of Medals‚Äù too. They don‚Äôt give those in this game type apparently.
---
Dude, exactly my thoughts.
---
Every mode is very populated. If you can't find a match, check your internet settings: many modes try to find a match with people on a good connection, and if you're on Wi-Fi or on some weird router settings it can complicate things.
---
No, whats spookier is top tree with a skullfort. Thats a shoulder charge that is NEVER on cooldown
---
i got it at night when i was about to log off and then when i popped back in the next morning, ready to take on the iron banner 20 fusion rifle kill challenge with an exotic i got just for it and bam, it was disabled
---
I've never received a 2nd rare one while having one in my inventory.
---
There are multiple rare bounty variants with differeing objectives.
---
i have played only crucible since friday on my new character, it is calm in fact. sort of strange now I am wondering.
---
I'd always finish any campaign in any game first before jumping into the end game content. You level up, unlock further endgame missions, enjoy a story (sometimes) and get a feel for the game.
---
One of us! 
---
One of us!
---
EXOTICS are a special case, however. **All Exotic Weapons Will Be Exactly The Same.** with the only differences for those being ones with *catalysts*, which are drops from certain activities (check a guide on what to do to get specific catalysts, if you're interested!).
---
**Exotic Armor pulled from Collections Will All Be The Same.** You can't keep pulling armor out of collections hoping for a different element or different stats. *However*, exotic armor from a world drop will be randomized, both element and stats.
---
Um. CN GG does the highest damage of any super. I believe it‚Äôs 120k+ for a crit. Bottom tree NS with OR hits 110k if you hit every arrow.

Isint that new angry af dude in moon like 980 summoned him big mistace screen said 980l
---
Or when you simply outrange someone..? Recluse has pretty good range for an SMG, and has a low enough ttk to demolish any shotgun apes.
---
range is the most important stat if u r going for pvp, handling doesnt matter much unless u r constantly switching guns
---
I think there's another factor in play, because I already finished those and they're both still not giving me the quest.
---
There is, yes. Check out Destiny Item Manager.
---
While it won't tell you precisely if a gun is a god roll, it will tell you which perk is generally favored by the community (though it's not always accurate). You can check the spreadsheet attatched to the top of this post for details, or ask specific questions in threads like this or over at /r/sharditkeepit .
---
DIM is a lifesaver. It lets you move items freely between characters and your vault with a button click. You can save load-outs on it as well.
---
Heroic is where it took me the longest too. As soon as I hit heroic 1 I was versing this 4,000 glory dude every game and I was going something like 1 win to 5 losses. Doesnt matter this season though, since I was getting 300 for a win and losing 12 for a loss..
---
Just constantly grind this season and you'll end up getting there bud.
---
Oh my gosh really?! Your so awesome!
---
Yes. 
---
I run skullfort top tree(i know, I use a shoulder charge that is never on cooldown, but against OEM‚Äôs with recluses, its the only way) with a Halfdan. Its a wierd kinetic, but I can pop off with that rifle.
---
You are correct about how Prime Engrams &amp; Rewards from Vendors work.
---
Need to get them again. Highest base power possible is determined by what you either have on you or in your characters inventory. If it's not in your inventory (in vault or dismantled) then it doesn't count.
---
While not all of them are from Exotic Quests (Trinity Ghoul!), all exotic bows *are* all behind the ol' Paywall.
---
I was a full time warlock in D1. Since they killed sunsinger I have now moved on to being a full time titan. I like the movement waaay better.
---
Thanks!
---
Handling is for how fast you look side to side.
---
What if bungie just removed the streak system? Make it as simple is a %50 loss xp and %100 win Xp.
---
I feel like the streak system does more damage than good.
---
I get the incentive but it‚Äôs also not reliable or a reflection of your efforts.
---
Hi, I'm Johnny Knoxville and welcome to Jackass Prime!
---
That would be so dope!
---
As much as it sucks, you only lose 4 glory up until fabled rank (haven't played since I hit it so don't know if it goes up or not) per lose. So you're not really losing much where your wins give you over 200 glory. Unless you lose 50 matches straight to lose all 200 glory per 1 win, you'll be ok. Just keep playing until you get the wins.
---
It‚Äôs not about that. Some of us just want to have fun without being assholes. That‚Äôs why people still play hunter and warlock
---
I can't count the number of times that came in clutch to save us from a wipe right before a boss was almost dead.
---
Thanks dude
---
when aiming
---
Please please please do hunter
---
Yes, I've had 2 rare Black Armory Bounties with different objectives.
---
Lol enjoy the grind brotha, Gambit is by far the most fun out of them all, menagerie is a close second but in Gambit it's always new coz you never know if u gotta struggle, carry the team or just be toxic and invade with hammerhead and kill the entire team Lmao and see them report you for losing all their notes in one invasion
---
A nighthawk can one shot a primeval at x4 I believe
---
Yeah I agree bubble is very good and I switch from that once in a while but I love middle tree only for the detonaters and being able to cheese Bergusia forge boss and other bosses.
---
Probably my favorite auto rifle ever. Lol
---
Hmmm I thought the only way to get Calus themed gear (to use to get tributes) are through raids? I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve got a single Calus themed gear which is why I‚Äôm saying this. (I probably stupidly dismantled them for Xur‚Äôs exotics or never gotten them)
---
I would love something like this again. J want to be able to pick and choose what perks I want to use. I hate being told that I have to run specific combinations. The current in game system is super restrictive and annoying.

Yes.

[so basically this](https://i.redd.it/mh400b9k5ym31.png)
---
Unfortunately Bungie wont do this for D2. If they decide to keep D2 as an ongoing game. And not make D3 they need to do this. That would be my only complaint.
---
Wait till you try risk runner, against hive or fallen it is absolutely OP. Once the arc chain starts you never reload and deal 300-400 damage per precision round.  It mows through hordes like Thor and mjolnir.
---
You could theoretically receive an Exptic Engram from any enemy in the game. I have gotten them from a dreg and a thrall before. But the best way to get exotics is strikes, raids, nightfall, and crucible. 
---
Also try to save 97 shards per week to buy the random engram from Xur. It is always guaranteed to be an Exotic that you don‚Äôt already have, so it‚Äôs a good way to get a new Exotic toy every week. If you play Vex Offensive for a couple of hours per week, you should get enough shards from dismantling drops to afford it.
---
I highly recommend joining a discord server for finding raid groups. You can actually search discord for certain games and there is a "Destiny 2 LFG" group that has thousands of people. I just joined up and was able to get a raid group within 5 minutes because people are constantly posting/organizing. It's a little daunting because of the registration/rules required to keep a machine that big running, but once you are registered it's the best way to quickly get a raid going IMO.
---
I want that as an emote, now!
---
Not really. Using OEM directly increases your lethality in almost any situation considerably with no effort at all. Even if you don't know how to play it to its highest level it will still do better than almost any other exotic in the game. And if you do know how to use it properly it's completely broken.
---
How do I do that?
---
You can get calus themed gear in menagerie as well.
---
Oh yea thank you
---
I was actually considering that! but I'd like to make a wallpaper with all 3 classes joined and don't think shaxx would fit in then..
---
I do the same with mountaintop recluse. I can respect this mentality.
---
What DLCs should I get to expand my content? And if I do what additional stuff can I do?
---
Recluse is a piece of piss to get this season. You barely get punished for losses.
---
I‚Äôll definitely look into the outbreak.
---
1920x1080 right?
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs Titan because I got it from savathuns song
---
Yeah sometimes you just have an almost irrational attachment to some specific weapon or type. I've developed a thing for bows with explosive heads, personally.

How do you get hubris?

I agree that it will shift another way. That‚Äôs PvP in every game like you said. It has been this way since forsaken though. I have seen bottom tree striker (on my team and against) go from one spawn to the other getting 5 kills in a 3v3 comp match that‚Äôs not close to balanced at all. 
---
I play battlefield and while that‚Äôs true about someone having all the guns and attachments, Destiny is a game where guns and armor don‚Äôt have intrinsic perks. One that can feed off each other making someone an unstoppable tank for a while. 
---
I‚Äôm not hating Titans. You guys didn‚Äôt create this armor piece. I Main ran a Titan in D1. I main a Hunter in D2. Every class has a counter if you‚Äôre skilled enough to use it. 
---
But, run 3 One Eyed Mask Titans with shotguns and bottom tree strikers in Comp and tell me it‚Äôs even close on paper not accounting for player skill. I‚Äôve earned every pinnacle weapon just fine with this being a thing. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs impossible. Just very weighted.

The Exo Stranger is Ana's sister
---
World exotic, can get it from exotic engrams, Xur when he sells it, or from Xurs fated Engram. Eververse doesn‚Äôt sell armor (ornaments =\= armor) or weapons.
---
You won't get anything special by doing the campaign, but it's a worthwhile thing to do as you'll get the story and all world drops, no matter what activity you're doing, will increase your Power until you hit 900.
---
Yeah, would love a mobile wallpaper of this OP

come on, gimme a titan one now

I bound melee to a mouse button and I still don't like to melee... we invented guns for a reason, so we can put the hurt on people from afar. :)
---
That‚Äôs a great idea. I hope there are people playing in Asia server there. I‚Äôm going to give it a try. Thank you!
---
Forsaken will give you more content and raids.
---
Shadowkeep will give you nightmare hunts and vex offensive
---
This isn‚Äôt quite right. He is running bottom tree striker, but he‚Äôs not wearing synthos in this vid. Synthos don‚Äôt change the super duration or the health that you get back from kills. That‚Äôs all rolled into the super itself.
---
We are both right and wrong.  I finally looked it up it‚Äôs from any strike in the heroic playlist.   So just doing the heroic strike playlist at some point will get you this sparrow.
---
Imagine if they reworked it to be able to switch firing modes by holding reload like Hardlight. Oh man.
---
Afaik it increases the energy you get them with, not the actual max energy.
---
Means try hard with the full cheese load out
---
You cant outright choose the strikes though.
---
I would love to have iron banner ornaments for my Armor I rocked iron trauge in my hunter still do cuz it was upgraded but my hunter looks like a beast wish I didn‚Äôt have to use upgrade modules to keep it that way
---
Lol, I‚Äôm attracted to chics with multiple personalities too
---
Revoker feels so much better to use than other snipers to me, no idea why. Im on PC so I don't get the big aim assist bump consoles get for range either. I think I just like the scope and sound.
---

---
The tribute Hall is how you get bad juju. I did it yesterday. No raiding needed. It's a very underwhelming pulse rifle compared to vigilance wing, graviton lance, bygones even. I was quite disappointed with it honestly.
---
I'll give it a go then cheers
---
NOW THATS A LOTTA DAMAGE
---
r/warlockmasterrace
---
Warlocks have one hit grenades (handheld super novas) and on top of that warlocks can one hit k.o with a bow with an empowering rift, I mean cmon. I swear man people who complain titans r op are just annoying asf. I mean cmon, just find a way to counter act it, not complain. Geez man.
---
Heard this from my fireteam member TheGrandLulz, in Menagerie the other day...
---
Yeah its a shame, but still. At least ya get them. That's if it's not exodus down for the 45th time in a row.
---
If you could add the Weapon types (aka Shotgun, sniper rifle, etc) to the God Roll Spreadsheet, that would be nice!
---
We basically already have supercell...... Risk Runner, and before people bitch just finish the catalyst and it increases the range.
---
I made a hunter after getting to around rank 15 and was able to claim all the armor pieces so I imagine it would work with ornaments as well
---
I see. I still want to try raids tho (gotta find 3 more friends apparently)  but I‚Äôll definitely look up on how to get the weapons you‚Äôve listed.
---
Ok thanks m8
---
good ol' muscle wizard
---
Thanks friend
---
Thanks for the original inspiration dude!
---
Yeah, you may drop a lvl 10 masterwork item, they're rare though.
---
And I have no ideia what the status on the burden is.
---
I have a misfit with 59 rounds but it feels like an smgas the fire rate is so high
---
Recluse is an smg it‚Äôs suppose to shred you at close range that‚Äôs the whole point of a smg like every other small weapons fight it at range and use a weapon with really good range.
---
Also recluse is the most relevant veist smg to be used btw so I‚Äôm more than happy for it‚Äôs existence cause veist hasn‚Äôt had anything good in a long time.
---
What system are you playing on?
---
If someone makes a Titan one all 3 should be together in one image now THAT'S a background image lol
---
I‚Äôm sorry did you miss the part where I had to grind out for decent armour designs rather than getting them straight out the collection?
---
Some of the shadier guardians probably brought it back to the city. Or someone stole it from some Warlocks. As for why they‚Äôre trying to smuggle it out... of the ONLY city... idk
---
when i was about to ask for a hunter one lmao
---
comin in clutch brother

Nope, tried it, it still does a vertical fuckton of damage

It's not just a new campaign. It consists of almost all of Destiny 2's endgame content pre-Shadowkeep, a ton of exclusive exotics, a new subclass for each character, the Forsaken campaign, two zones--it's a lot. It's all of Destiny 2's Year 2 content.

---
Lol perfect
---
Ok I see ur point and I agree, hunter throwing knives on gunslinger should one hit but maybe instead of complaining about titan melees, just complain to bungie to buff hunter abilities, cause if people keep complaining about this and that then bungie is just gonna nerf everything and then the game just becomes boring. I mean yea maybe they'll nerf titans  first but then what's next? Who's to say they wont nerf hunter abilities etc.?
---
I like this seasons set :(
---
You can't yet, with that title we'll get the bow today (the last thing for the collections badge) and then we'll get the undying mind kill during the final assault as hosted by Ikora later in the season.
---
Seismic Strike Spammer reporting for duty
---
I would highly suggest Destiny Item Manager. It shows some of the hidden stats for weapons (Aim Assist, Recoil Direction, etc.) It really lets you see the difference that certain perks make and it helps make a bit more sense of all the perks. Especially the perks in the first 2 columns. I've heard really good things about Ishtar Collective as well, I've just been using DIM for a while, so it's kind of just habit now.

Noted, will definitely need to change that
---
I think you mean Christmas egg
---
I don't use the Recluse and most top tier comp players don't either. It's not as good as everyone makes it out to be. My loadout is Outlast and Dust Rock Blues with Hammerhead or Revoker and Not Forgotten with Hammerhead. I hardly ever use my Recluse.
---
Git gud

Sure do!

It's name is tr3-VR (trevor), you can see it on a monitor right before you reach it. I guess it's just some cleaning or maintenance bot that's been malfunctioning since the old tower was destroyed.
---
Lets make comp great again!  It should be solely based on skill, and precision and not heavy ammo camping and super chaining.  Lets get the heavy ammo and super abilities removed from comp and have it solely be raw skill vs raw skill.
---
How come? Its light being taken from a ghost, seems pretty accurate lol
---
We've seen how ghaul took the light from us but what would it be like if something like Oryx were to rip the light from a ghost right in front of us?
---
Yep, accurate name.
---
Appreciate the love and feedback though! &lt;3
---
Sorry man xbox
---
wrong sub reddit...
---
Spin to win, baby
---
I uhh also don't have any masks :c
---
If you masterwork any item it gives +2 to all stats.
---
zero hour solo is fun to run. heroic not so much
---
I don‚Äôt know. The helmet and the cape make it for me. But yeah Titan and Warlock Iron Banner armor are the shit. I think they really did well with all of them.
---
Probably not unless they completely redo it. Bungie wants to go away from RNG gunfights, so hawkmoons entire concept of 3 luck in the chamber rounds doesn‚Äôt really work.
---
I'm checking it right now, and yeah, it's smooth. I'll be looking at the hidden stats. Thanks for the tip!

REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Dude i totally missed that! will fix now!
---
In the eye
---
You meant hunter can tank damage in destiny 2 right now? yeah that's the bs.
---
Looking sick man
---
I like the cape, but not the helmet lol, again its just the weird ski goggles look that throws it all off for me. Warlock and Titan just look super cool, because of the lack of any way for them to see through the helmet, if that makes sense.
---
REEEEEEEEE
---
Lol my clan is called word from fenchurch
---
That‚Äôs absolutely wicked my guy
---
you can aim your weapons while doing double jump and flying, and you get a in air dodge. The super is much worse than bottom tree dawnblade, but if you learn it it‚Äôll work
---
I CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT I'M SEEING!
---
Why use small dirty stick when can use bullets on wall to show. Lasts longer.
---
Supers and abilities are an intrinsic part of destiny whether you like it or not.
---
Only thing I've always hated about the crucible set is the stupid motorcycle helmet. To be fair, a lot of the warlock hats look like motorcycle helmets of various levels of effectiveness but the crucible one doesn't tie in enough of the rope sorta muai thai or monk-theme elements they use on all the other pieces. Seems out of place, not your fault though
---
That's true, I usually use the stats to narrow down on the guns I do like. Like I can't use any other pulse rifle besides Blast Furnace. It just feels right in my hands. I recently got Bad Juju and just don't like how it feels at all.
---
Cool thanks. I'm looking for either that roll or No Distractions + Snapshot
---
I got a 7 kill streak just by punching last week with my titan in Iron Banner using Wormgods Caress.  So you are right.
---
Gunslinger looks like he is about to gun down both Arcstrider and Nightstalker with style.
---
you should make wallpapers for phones too!
---
The expansions will only add more missions, story content and exotic quests. 
---
So sure, get as much stuff as you can/want.
---
I‚Äôm a simple guy. 
---
I see people making fun of warlocks 
---
I upvote 
---
*chuckles*
---
I have to admit I don‚Äôt quite get it as I can aim while jumping with anything? But I‚Äôll take the air dodge. 
---
I‚Äôll try the supers and see (: thank you!
---
Your right I forgot about the titsns' throwing hammer as well still want to say warlocks win in range?
---
P.s. this is not d1
---
*cries vex milk*
---
The way it should be...
---
Removed? No. Make it harder to get? Yes. As in longer spawn intervals for heavy or just one per match. Supers should take longer to get as well.
---
Assuming you're talking about pve, you've got Austringer, Spare Rations, Midnight Coup, redrix's Broadsword, and breakneck are some good kinetic primaries. As far as kinetic specials you've got mountaintop, izanagi's burden, a good rolled long shadow or other primary sniper, threat level or even the new moon shotty.
---
no the thing is, when you activate your jump while aiming, you‚Äôll stop aiming. And when gliding in air normally and you aim, you stop gliding. Not with bottom tree dawnblade
---
He's Destiny's Bob Ross?
---
Thank you. I'm still in the process of making sense of everything (so much googling) but coming from Warframe tis ain't nothing~. Most of my confusion is probably from how seemingly less streamlined everything is. Destiny feels a lot more MMO-ish with all its subsystems, which I didn't expect.
---
I haven't even been grinding for that gun yet and my medals are at 78%. That's passive progress without trying. Another part is completed and the Scout rifle kills are the easiest I'm sure and that's only at 17%. I'll have that grind done by not even trying. The trying part will be actually using a scout rifle.
---
I started my Titan a couple weeks ago and the OEM was like the first exotic I got.
---
*omnigul scream
---
That‚Äôll probably be the last mission in D3, darkness surrounds us. Then come the fallen, then Calus and the Cabal with something like ‚Äúthis system is ours too!‚Äù or ‚ÄúWe will not die quietly‚Äù then come the Hive and Take as they realize what is going on. Then the Vex. Then Zavala and Savthun and Calus are all communicating with each other and forming a battle plan
---
I‚Äôd be fine with no heavy. What annoys me the most is every round becomes about hovering close to the heavy to stop the other team from getting it. Parts of the map far from heavy see pretty much no play because of this. Supers are fine imo if used at a bad time, yeah it will get some kills but the enemy team can come back. If used at a good time can seal a round or match win.
---
I don't know.  Think about the skill if we were all on the same playing field.  I don't think there are supers in CS:GO or Counterstrike... but maybe i'm wrong.
---
You get a nostalgic engram every 5 levels.
---
Ah yes, the raw skill of OEM Titans...
---
Having heavy spawn every round is just plain stupid
---
Yes... but comp is different.  Comp should be about raw skill.  Supers are fine everywhere else, even in all the other pvp modes.
---
I like how as soon as he's out of super he's immediately garbage at the game.
---
Here I am some 50 black armoury bounties in for 0 rares.. feels bad
---
I had a completely different experience in Iron Banner, and with Crucible in general.  
---
Very, very rarely do I recall been killed by either Recluse or a shoulder charge. I play Titan but I always run Sentinel double shield or Hammerbro. I maybe had 10 shoulder charge kills in the dozens of games played, probably died just as many times trying to force it running face first into bullets.  
---
Also rarely saw Titans with the OEM or I just didn't notice?  
---
Rarely was killed by hand cannons.  
---
I played enough IB to finish all of the Pinnacle bounties and the seasonal quest thing, really can't recall any real patterns.   
---
Remember seeing more than a few Bygones? Yeah a couple Recluse but I just assumed it was people finishing the SMG part of the quest like me (I just used the IB one a match gave me.)  
---
I don't know, I ran Suros Regime for most of IB with Dual Speed Receiver and never felt outmatched, would win 75% or so of my 1 vs 1s, hell you can get (and I did) 3-4 kills in a single clip with headshots.  
---
Maybe I'm just not in the really sweaty bracket? Was IB matchmade via Skill or connection?
---
Oh! Since the meme is referring to the up tree I thought that was it.
---
Thank you! I‚Äôll try those. I gotta admit I never use dawnblade lul
---
HELL YEAH!!
---
Shhh he doesn't need to know.
---
nice. I got the graviton lance from mine. been loving it ever since :D (I love pretty 'splosions and fireworks)
---
I've been prefiring corners and getting cheap kills with 1k so it's easy for me
---
But my lmgs are not really that good they just dont put down as fast as I need to then I drop heavy and they have a truth or wardcliff to kill another teammate
---
As if anyone uses exotics like the crest, Horn, or heart
---
Titans are trash though
---
no they nerfed it. it¬¥s around +30% dmg buff. what makes the gun so good is that bodyshots do almost the same dmg as headshots with the perk active
---
New light guardian: wow. He seems pretty touh. I should wait for a few other b4 i take him On. 
---
a fucking savage veteran:  ahhh shit here we go again.
---
Press crouch twice and break all aim assist I love hunters
---
Xbox One X then?
---
Loaded question is a great pve pinnacle weapon and recluse is a pvp pinnacle that is insane in pve, you also have jotunn and izanami's burden are awesome exotic weapons from the forges. There are definitely other pinnacle and exotic guns that i havent mentioned. I got most of these last year so I am not sure which ones became available to new light players.
---
thank goodness
---
I just have the hardest time getting a team that stays. People just rather not help and just play with people that KWTD
---
Who runs shoulder charge in pve? Who DOESN'T run shoulder charge in pvp?
---
too many fanboys kids here, fanboys of destiny pvp mygod lol
---
Bungie, if you're reading this...
---
You know what you have to do now.
---
I'm actually running this right now, and as soon as the dodge ends your health drops back to it's prior state. So it's not actually quite as crazy as it looks.  
---
  
---
There are two really good options for it with top tree, but neither one is really oppressive:  
---
1. Liars Handshake, where it makes you a total melee monster, I've gotten melee only reaper medals.       
---
2. Wyrmhusk Crown, where it makes you really, *really* hard to kill.    
---
Good sure, but not actually broken.
---
My God my OCD is acting up again. The left side triangle is jutting out, meaning the inside point has more space than the other. Although it is very small.
---
It‚Äôs fan made but technically yea
---
And now?
---
Hunter master race
---
yeah all the idiots saying it's fine are really dumb!)
---
hey dude this is cool! As hunter i'm proud of you!
---
I can sleep
---
I saw a "Scrota, sack of Oryx" the other day.  I couldn't stop laughing
---
If anything we'd be facing off alongside Eliksni and Cabal against an overwhelming tide of Hive and Taken at the behest of the Darkness. The Hive have served the Darkness for longer than the Solar System has existed...
---
Still ready to die fighting side-by-side with a ~~Fallen~~ friend
---
This is awesome!

---
fair. but judging from the clip, I could see an argument for celestials edging out the lasers in niche cases where bosses have phases. If you could time yer hits just right, you could skill multiple/all phases, whereas the lasers, due to taking longer to deal the same dmg, could end up wasting some dmg as the boss goes invuln.
---
Other than that, I can see the other argument that the warlocks have better average case damage, due to it being more lenient to moving targets. whereas hunters are very 'hit or miss', literally.
---
I know. Same exact feeling. Who cuts onions then?
---
"Geomags? Never heard of em"
---
The time has come and so have I.
---
*cries*: MY GUY!
---
I got some fries. May I have some of that salt. A good fix is don't play crucible. Every single day there's at least 10 people crying about some aspect of crucible. Learn to use your abilities and learn to get the heavy or stop playing. You can literally snipe someone who just picked up heavy. Heavy does not = an instant win....ever.
---
That's because most people neglect to optimize their gear and during those strikes it'll be easier to take down champions together. I've ran it with to randoms and we melted everything, because we rolled every enemy together no one was trying to be a solo act.
---
Hope for the catalyst to drop Night and Day different!

The percentage rounds up. Do another one and you‚Äôll have it before the 1st stage is done.
---
Exactly the case too. I just happened to get hit by the cyclops and he just ran straight through me instead of just picking me up, the cyclops was the last enemy anyway so there was no reason to even do that. Lets just say I took my sweet time getting back -\_-
---
Not gonna lie.. I'd be completely cool with a change like this.
---
It's not meant to be enjoyable. It's meant to be out of reach for 90% of players that can't do high level content. Same with the raids having contest modifier, it's challenging content that rewards some of the best stuff. If you can't do the 980, do the 950. If you find the 950 boring then pve isn't for you, sorry if that sounds harsh.

The 950 was a cakewalk and is not a way to get the ship. You need to complete the master variant in order to get the ship for the Undying seal, which is the only reason why i'm interested in it.
---
Oh. I didnt see a timer but I guess I wasn't looking
---
You can always hit the fireteam app or the lfg discords

What does it actually mean :D
---
If im in strikes. Most times in not qaiting on the blue berrys to catch up. New lights too. Gotta go fast,efficient, 5min strike spams.  But every now and then ill toss a revive if i spawn in to the strike and see a homie get clapped
---
Well, the champions in the 980s take some coordination to take down. Did you Bild a balanced fire team? Maybe an izwnagi ortwo, or divinity? 
---
Our average clear time for inverted spire is under 15 minutes.
---
Sunshot is a good exotic for ad clearing, decent firerate as well.
---
Great name
---
 
---
So Sniper rifles, shotguns, fusion rifles, OEM, grenade launchers, machine guns and rocket launchers.  Anything else you want removed from comp to make you feel better?
---
Oh I def prefer the fur on the collar and the wolf emblems. I think a nice combination of the 2 would be the best option and I agree as well that they should just make all the previous IB armors ornaments at this point.
---
Sorry to ask this but by chance do you know what time the weekly reset is?
---
You still playing beta? Lol
---
Sunshot has explosive rounds which means half (I think) isn‚Äôt affected by range at all, so it‚Äôs effective range is actually pretty good. Of course, the catalyst helps a lot too
---
Red War/curse of Osiris/warmind - free
---
Forsaken - $25
---
Shadowkeep - $35
---
They replay that music during the final mission as well, which feels almost poetic
---
Yh I've definitely got glory, i'll just try to relog like  others have said and hope it fixes.

Ayyyy I'm going for a green goblin look on my hunter, can't find an only green shade though.

Ohhhh dam I was 90% on one of the bounties

Good Jon attaboy Jon
---
I other words, make comp not Destiny.  Tired of reading this garbage.
---
You'll also get recluse
---
Now i remember why i haven't done raids for a while, apart from being warm outside.
---
Crown of sorrows is my least played raid because people wouldn't stick or had no sense of coordination.
---
I miss the days when people played for fun. It gpt really annoying with crown of sorrow.
---
Seriously?! Where are my hard earned Banner ornaments and Faction Ornaments?
---
I never got any of the trials armour but the people that did should definitely be able to have access to it. Why is only a small selection of Eververse ornaments available?
---
Thank you ^^
---
I'll be uploading a unmarked version after my creation post gets approved on the bungie website.

Half expected to see OEM and Recluse rather than ACTUAL classes..

The helmet is ass.
---
Still my favorite Emote , Its a great flex lol.
---
Unpopular opinion: OEM Isn't that tough to deal with people are just whiny prats, the crucible at large can go to hell.
---
Are you a moron?
---
Exactly this.
---
..are you sure? I see bottom tree allllllll the time
---
Gimmie that D1 knight style armor.
---
You‚Äôd either end up with the situation mentioned above or the same skill trees. That‚Äôs why we have the set skill trees that provide great synergy with each other. Moving them around would require more balancing, which could lead to more broken things, and will leave us with a broken build for 3 seasons or a perk being disabled.
---
You missed my point lol. I was saying that you dont see this sub filled with posts bitching about dawnblade still, yet you do with oem.
---
That was my point, I'm not agreeing with op

Can you make one for a titan? &lt;3

The best thing I could see are skills that aren‚Äôt associated with the trees like the seasonal artifact, but what we‚Äôve got now is great.
---
Wait theres other classes besides Hunter?
---
vivio47
---
Yeah I know. Was just adding to it. 
---
Every post is whining about map control, a key point in comp for pretty much any mode. Heavy is just a focus point for that map control.
---
Why ADS. Recoil is horrible on console and it's perks are built around hip fire
---
I got it done last night
---
I agree that buffing hunter up to par is better for the game than nerfing everything.
---
So anyway I started blasting.
---
Do you still have the bounty or did it disappear?  I used to be able to keep it until next IB, but it means you don't get to grab the same bounty next IB (you miss out on one bounty reward).
---
The IB quest carries over till the end of the season for sure.
---
Damn what gun is that
---
If you could do titans you‚Äôll have my support
---
Yeah I got all the way to legend or mythic in The crucible before I realized I had to be playing 3 v 3 mode
---
Yea, I had to go through a lot of shaders to find what worked best.
---
Boi... that clickbait tho \^\^
---
I'm a very sub par player and just hit fabled with the reset. Also only played solo cue. Wins net so much more and losses aren't as punishing.
---
Ohh thank you thank you
---
Took me doing one more match before it unlocked the triumph. Probably relog or something will do it too.
---
I'm not good enough for that, my power is 948.
---
Damn I used to love that gun in Destiny 1. Pre and post nerf good lord it was so much fun to use.
---
Think they did that on purpose. That‚Äôs what they were referring to when they said they made this season scary on a subconscious level...
---
Thats good, too bad I don't have any bright dust.
---
I will play with u, dutch as well! Playing in the evenings. Steam name? I will invite you
---
Thank you
---
The meta right now is hard to use a hc to get kills.   Fast pulse rifles and scouts will tear you.  Recluse  and shottys will pain happy like trees with your blood on the wall and snipers will clear your skull from anmile away.  Fusion rifles clap b4 your second shot can land and gls are just a bundle of joy.  But if you do outplay them. You just have that little joy of knowing they suck.
---
Neat. Is the bow any good?
---
Thanks
---
Bubble Titan squad rep
---
Do the weekly bounties from all the vendors on all your character and you should get a good chunk of bright dust
---
It‚Äôs decent! Depends on how you want to play. 3 shots yellow bars on the moon.
---
This looks amazing.
---
You want to see aggregated stats across characters? 
---
If you click the menu icon, you can quickly switch characters, but we dont have an aggregate view just yet. We will look into that.
---
I‚Äôm a titan main and... pretty accurate honestly
---
It's always like this until you stormtrance and wipe them all out. Not to mention it's always the hunters that cry for nerfs
---
You only need to get the weapon core one time
---
THANK YOU!
---
rng
---
Right and I get that but why are raids the only source? Something like heroic menagerie could have fulfilled a similar role but it‚Äôs no different than the normal version now.
---
Ikora is powerful and smart enough to know what she‚Äôs doing and if anything does go wrong she will contain it
---
I just started playing as Hunter today after switching from my main warlock. I haven‚Äôt had much problem in dealing with titans in the game as much as a hunter. Mostly due to dodge giving overshield with arc battery.
---
However, as a warlock I was a constant punching bag for titans. I think I will main hunter for PvP and warlock for pve.
---
Yes aggregated stats would be awesome. I like how I can see my pergi mace individually on each character as well. Great job
---
Raids aren't the only source, theres also IB like you said. But this loops around to the fact that theres a lack of pinnacle activities, which I think will change throughout the year
---
I already got the weapon core for the machine gun and I already forged it, I need a new weapon core for the hand cannon blueprint that I got.
---
Bottom tree solar with Celestial Nighthawk. I don't think you can top that for burst damage if you hit the crit.
---
Actually, one of the biggest mistakes I see players make is holding their super. It's essentially guaranteed 1-2 easy kills, with a decent chance at a full team wipe. People should be using them as much as possible because there's enough time to get 2 or 3 supers each game, so that's a lot of free kills that people are giving up if they don't use them
---
Even if you get even 1 kill, in most situations I'd say the super was worth it. Hell, if your super was enough to scare an entire enemy team off of heavy it would be worth casting even if you dont get a kill
---
This gave me some ‚ÄúGhost‚Äù vibes. NICE!
---
I sorted by new and saw 1.
---
Sorry if the post isn't well written and easy to understand, english isn't my first language
---
I dont know who thought it was ok and honestly didnt understand it. From 9 to 3 seconds, but it requires a crouching headshot? Meanwhile oem just activates on kill with no requirements other than taking damage. Kinda funky if you ask me.
---
That's wicked cool I need that as my phones background
---
ow
---
I believe its 30 bucks and i find it worth it but its just a matter of opinion
---
Not even close baby
---
Fuck that guy. Burritos are fucking delicious.
---
*D1 kings horn intensifies*
---
Exactly, it's not like it activates easily
---
Hey OP can I use this for my profile pic?
---
If its not too much to ask, since I cant get the app to work for some reason, could I perhaps trouble you with a screenshot of whats available this week, including the dust screen?
---
I would greatly appreciate it, if cant its also alright.
---
It‚Äôs a sleeper in reckoning. I‚Äôve gotten the explosion and detonators to become self sustaining off of shadow thrall. Reaches out and touches people at good ranges too.
---
[know that feel](https://ibb.co/gtCqgVF)
---
Pretty sure you just finish the bounty and dont have to get another weapon core
---
What is that
---
You need to wait till the sabadors are there.  Kill him and then open the box.  That should help man.
---
We all know that in the final moment, we will just be a bunch of useless spectators while Mara Sov and her friends annihilate the Darkness
---
My PS4 keeps pushing the digital deluxe version when I look at it, so you could be right, if I get shadowkeep would that come with forsaken?
---
We lose the player hub because someone cracked the glass. Destiny 3 campaign, right there.
---
The sabadors?
---
I got you after I smoke this blunt rq
---
Dw I can actually relate I found it so boring from the release of the game to forsaken but I decided to get Shadowkeep on a whim even though I still found the game boring from playing forsaken and I found the game amazing and addicting, with all the new mechanics and gameplay, it is now one of my favourite games
---
Did you use nvidia ti record this or another program?
---
Well i should be getting it the easy way
---
I also cant upgrade it to a higher light level
---
I implied that I am less likely to support corporate entities engaging in political maneuvers that are not directly tied to the industry. I implored the folks at Bungie to go as individuals instead of representing the brand. That's it. You don't appear keen on reading comprehension, so you made this wild strawman against me instead of trying to actually understand my perspective.
---
Arc for aoe clear. Solar bottom for big dick energy.
---
You have to do the quest steps for it, you have the first version of the gun and finishing the quest step gives you more ammo and will actually count as having the gun
---
I see you‚Äôre a man of culture as well
---
Haven't been on Reddit for weeks, dildo. Check my history.
---
U have the un-finish version?
---
&gt; Sadly I don‚Äôt really fancy shotguns and especially for pve.  
---
Neither do I, I just want it for the one two punch buff that multiplies the cross counter buff, that stacks with 3 x stacks of combination blow, that gets amplified by my buddies well, to then one phase a raid boss with my bare hands.    
---
&gt;Do you get that essence only from the nightmare hunts?  
---
So, as I understand it, the essences can all drop at random from nightmares, but that's pretty rare.  Alternatively, you can run one of the rotating nightmare hunts for a specific essence (last week was servitude, pride, and anguish- no rage though) 
---
Thing is, Once you've completed an essence you can then buy it from the altar of enchantment by eris morn, recomplete it, and pick up a new roll of that gear piece or weapon.  
---
&gt;Does that mean there are other weapons that drop similar ways 
---
by getting an essence from NH?    
---
There's some good shit in there.  
---
The tranquiilty sniper rifle is a primary slot sniper that can roll the firing line perk with a 5 bullet mag.   
---
    
---
&gt; I didn‚Äôt even have time to do them last week as they didn‚Äôt seem worth it    
---
Seems like it's worth doing each one once to unlock the essence for future purchase at the altar, after that?  I dunno, if you want to farm up a godroll for one of those items, you would just use the altar instead of the nightmare hunt to get the corresponding essence.
---
Whoever did this did not do a good job
---
Because you didn‚Äôt finish it‚Äôs quest that‚Äôs the broken acrius with only one shot
---
No, it was never good. I main titan and the super return was very inconsistent
---
You gotta fully upgrade it
---
I want to forge another weapon so I bought another blueprint, to finish this blueprint I need to get another weapon core just like I did for the first one.
---
Thank you kindly, friend!
---
The books of sorrow were my second favorite part of the grimoire card, right after the weaponsof sorrow. In general all the Hive stuff appeals the most to me.
---
The guys with the shield bots around them. They gaurd the boxes and when you defeat one. You will be able to loot a box and gain the core.   It been a while since i had to do weapon cores so id try that.
---
I'm getting mixed signals here, some people are saying it's good and some say it's not, looks like I'm Gonna have to try it out for myself
---
*flattered titan noises*
---
Lol
---
Bottom tree super projectiles are seeking.
---
Gunslinger is probably the way to go. It‚Äôs a subclass based around your weapons, and it‚Äôs super does a ton of damage.
---
Nightstalker is a possible contender after it recently got a buff, but if stealth isn‚Äôt your thing you might want to stick to Gunslinger.
---
The remaining subclass (Arcstrider) is based around melee combat and dodging.
---
That‚Äôs a steal lul
---
Yes there is essence-specific gear you can get by using the altar on the moon. They all look awesome aesthetically too.
---
Ah my lovely Palpatine main class
---
Id kill to have these in game, if only there was steam workshop skins like tennogen in wf but for destiny...
---
I usually don't use Blade Barrage on my Hunter for boss damage, I prefer to invade with it and force them to choke after the first wave of their super spam is over. 75% of the time it works 100% of the time.
---
Oh is the quest out?
---
Yeah that's true, I'd say it's better than bottom tree striker currently and with this nerf to that, that gap is only going to get even bigger :/
---
Fuck warmind I guess
---
I thought you had to have forsaken to even do the black armory forges.
---
They‚Äôre like hunters. Salty because they get killed a lot by guardians.
---
I'll be making a new one tomorrow.. Lots of people wanting the other expansions added
---
That dance seems to go with any 4/4 rhythm song. It's perfectly synced up for that beat, like every 4 count it changed perfectly, they probably animated it to a 4/4 beat.
---
It comes that way, if I'm not mistaken.
---
Unfortunately with no heavy *and supers* I feel like it would be rise of the night stalkers, since they have the best neutral game and worst super
---
Even then, when I don't spec for a single exotic, it's still pretty easy to counter. It's just like any other exotic, except that it does a lot of things in a mediocre fashion whereas other exotics do one thing really well.
---
House of kings became the house of dusk (all the blue fallen in D2). Uldren killed the kell of kings which eliminated the final kell of the fallen. The barons were from the house of exile from the moon, not sure what happened to the rest of them. The devils and i assume the devil splicers are part of Eramis‚Äô new crew, which you see in the Zero Hour mission (they‚Äôre looking for siza cuz it‚Äôs addictive af). Variks from house judgement is somewhere trying to create a unified fallen house that is independent and free, while Mithrax wants to join us with the traveler (house of light). Yes, byf also has a great video titled something like ‚Äúthe game of thrones of destiny‚Äù
---
All the armor in that picture is from eververse they did it on purpose
---
Yea this image is pretty accurate but to me at least it seems that recluse sweatlords has disappeared lately in console
---
I never said put both in the same playlist.
---
Please tell me you emoted right after that
---
Bottom and top are part of the same image, was tempted to put shaxx in but it didn't look right... The version on this link is a bit different, and the bottom doesn't look so awkward: 
---
Make sure to download the HQ version
---
How long have you been playing? I have three characters with a rediculous number of legendaries between the three of them.
---
Yeah it was a joke lol
---
Honestly, who the hell considers facing a roaming Striker with a shotgun?? You're dead before you can shot them.
---
Long range DOES work, though. But that's assuming you're on a map and in a position to take advantage of said range.
---
Our only comfort is that Titans tend to run in a straight line most of the time XD
---
Drop shadow too much
---
That does sound insanely better. Maybe my rng is ass because the second and third slot are always the same perks lol
---
Thanks a bunch!
---
It's boring.
---
The Handcannon recoil thing doesn‚Äôt make any sense, mate.
---
All HC should recoil like precision frames.
---
Eye of the storm/rampage is a good roll. Not my preferred god roll, but still good.
---
Well, if you don‚Äôt mind about it being an exotic, the Monte Carlo is really good, especially for titans. There are other good auto but I don‚Äôt know enough to help more than this
---
Thank you!
---
Dude i just got mine.
---
I second this
---
I think it's great, well done friend!
---
Chaos reach is just one long drawn out punch
---
Nova warp is just punching in all directions
---
Well of radiance is just punching nicely
---
I know I‚Äôve abused it since they made gambit like that and intentionally lost a round just for a 3rd round. Also warlock chaos reach with the exotic boots didn‚Äôt run out of juice also but I think they messed with warlock already
---
You gotta open the chest. Bergusia‚Äôs is unobtainable.
---
Nah thinking about it your probably right, I played from release to before first DLC came out so I only really have base game legendaries plus some new ones I got over the last few weeks I've been back. 
---
Apologies, didn't think about new stuff that I probably missed.
---
Haha, nope
---
I'm not 100%sure, but it's usually 2x (at least during the week)
---
Alright, thank you so much for your help. Love the wallpaper btw!
---
I open the chest but don‚Äôt get anything out of it
---
Nah I definitely can't walk through. It's annoying as my last collectible is in there.
---
Will definitely keep that in mind for the next one
---
I'd honestly be all for it, I can see some issues that people would have, people will bitch about anything anyway but I'm never opposed to a new game especially if it has a good story and soundtrack.
---
What do you mean is unobtainable how do I obtain it?
---
Bottom tree NS? Beats me, I main NS but never seen 999,999 on my screen like I do with bottom tree Gunslinger with Nighthawk. Lol.
---
Thanks. I'm really bad at this god roll stuff. Went I used to play most guns had one special perk and weren't randomized
---
Glad you like it!
---
This is when you need to channel the spirit of Shin Malphur
---
K thanks. You know when its 3x?
---
Might actually go for horrors least this week
---
I agree it‚Äôs very beatable. Especially because a large body of players from that pool lean very hard on getting that kill in a crowd to keep going. If they are shut down because the over committed, it‚Äôs not an issue. 
---
The true broken part is in Comp. no super should be able to travel from one spawn to another while getting an annihilation and still be able to kill 2 people respawning elsewhere in elimination when there are respawn timers. No other class is even remotely capable. Warlock daw blade close-also getting nerfed. 
---
I‚Äôve maintained a north of 2 efficiency all year against it. Just ready for a change.
---
You don‚Äôt. As of right now burgusias key is glitched and unobtainable.
---
low skill floor mechanics that emphasize insta kills all bundled into one amazing stupid looking class, call me bias but titans are stupid and stupid looking, i guess thats what happens if you hit your face off the wall bungie put up in front of  actual pvp balance instead of a shitty playground for people to "feel powerful"
---
ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Got mine a while ago. Good right?
---
Ah well if that's the case, perhaps... but I'm not sure a no super playlist even makes sense competitively unless it's 100% for fun. Because honestly some classes have terrible supers but great neutral game and some have terrible neutral game and great supers.
---
Looking forward to seeing them..
---
Ps. I think you've started a mini trend on D2 reddit.. The wallpaper memes are coming!
---
It's pretty OP
---
I was talking about One Eyed Mask though, not the super. I agree, the super is a bit ridiculous. The exotic no longer assists the super at all, if that's what you're implying. They removed that a long time ago.
---
This thing is nuts me and a clan mate took it into private to mess around with it. The bow one shots supers by themselves it‚Äôs disgusting.
---
IM HERE TO PUNCH STUFF
---
Ok thanks! I'm just spamming strikes right now and tbh i like them so i'll prob keep on keeping on!
---
Ah cool, i'll keep doing what i'm doing then
---
Still viable, at least in lower to mid tier MM (pretty sure that's where I'm at). Came back with the new F2P model. Was playing bubble last night. In one match, twice I had 3 punching kills from people rushing in bubble (running synthoceps). So much D1 nostalgia. Was laughing so hard. Even had the old Fun Police maneuver of dropping the suppressor in the bubble as a bladedancer or whatever they are now comes rushing in.
---
I found this on Adventure in Mercury IDK how can I add more pictures but I will upload more and send here from steam.
---
Sweird because every item in D2 is pushed to 750 with shadowkeep all the gear you have should be 750
---
Thomas the pain train
---
Rip
---
It wouldn't be fun if it was too fast.
---
Are you in the solo queue?
---
It‚Äôs really sad.  We had a rando join our party chat for some crucible the other night.  Some one else had the Monte Carlo drop for them and this guy lost his mind. A grown ass man acting a child because someone else got the drop. I can‚Äôt stand people like that.
---
Haven‚Äôt got anyone to play with lmao, and yea play more but I‚Äôm losing 2/3 games
---
You should prob grind out your chalice so you can get ready for the izanagi catalyst
---
Yea, no friends lol
---
This is actually sick
---
What?
---
Lookin like ghaul ngl
---
&gt;worthles internet points on a worthless matter
---
And what does that make your reply? Fulfilling?
---
Do you have a PSD of this or something similar? I have an idea I'd like to try in wallpaper engine.
---
 [http://www.destinylfg.net/](http://www.destinylfg.net/)
---
Better than countdown
---
Do you need shadow keep?
---
You look on the map of the tower. They have a special icon. Like Shaxx, Zavala, Hawthorne, etc. If they are green they are not special, which means you already did their challenge.
---
I was just making sure you're clicking on the solo queue Tabb and not the team one, because yes you're going to have a bad time against teams.
---
Looks really nice, I‚Äôm gonna use it
---
The word ‚Äútaken‚Äù still has a literal meaning, even in the Destiny universe.  Plus the Taken don‚Äôt have light so this title only makes sense in the context OP had in mind
---
Yes survival is the Glory game mode. No there shouldn‚Äôt be any changes coming soon or ever since they just changed it to be exclusively survival like it always should‚Äôve been. As far as tips for playing it, obviously there is always the ‚Äúlearn to work with the team‚Äù idea. On a serious note while it is very helpful and tends to work well when you play around what your team is doing, working on your own skills with a solo mindset helps too. It keeps you prepared for those times when you are the last guardian standing which unfortunately happens way too much. Spend your time focusing on how the enemy played and what you could do to improve instead of focusing on winning. Stay actively engaged in the mechanics you are applying and trying to improve at and the wins will come on their own.
---
Right now Survival is the only way to earn Glory. I have no idea whether Bungie plans to rotate other modes in like Countdown or Control; I haven‚Äôt seen anything to that effect but someone might have more info than me. 
---
Try identifying the strong player on your squad and supporting them with team shooting and otherwise just play your life. Pretty basic stuff but it‚Äôll get you started.
---
Lol I just spit out my drink.
---
Omg I have been queuing for teams, ty so much
---
Jotunn will get you there real quick for the medals.  For whatever reason the cold fusion medal counts a lot towards it. Instead of 1% per 3 matches, it‚Äôs closer to 2-3% each match.
---
I don't even always use OEM as a titan. Sometimes i throw on my doom fangs, or dune marchers. Stop giving me shit for playing titan pls.
---
I would be friends if it wasn't for those teeth.
---
That acolyte looking hot ngl.
---
Damn only rank 37
---
You can actually summon your sparrow in that area! I personally prefer that to the fallen vehicles any day.
---
That's some high quality IMBARU you've got there, my friend.
---
They supposedly made the grind easier in this season (I haven‚Äôt played any comp), if you‚Äôre solo queueing, make sure you‚Äôre in the right playlist that way you aren‚Äôt going against premades. Lock down heavy ammo before the enemy team does, it pretty much guarantees a round win. Using a mic might help, but most people don‚Äôt, so it doesn‚Äôt really matter too much. Make sure you‚Äôre loadout fits the map (i.e. for long open maps use scouts and snipers, for close quarters walled off maps use shotguns and smgs). If you aren‚Äôt comfortable using a gun, don‚Äôt force yourself to use it. Other than that, just keep playing and hope bungo‚Äôs matchmaking favors you, good luck!
---
Not bad not bad
---
I‚Äôve gotten 8 exotics total and they where all trash roll y1s  I have 200 hours logged on steam
---
In solo queue follow your teammates and hope to team shoot the enemies they find. Focus on staying alive more so than getting kills. I‚Äôm a pretty terrible crucible player but this worked for me
---
The reason nobody fucking asked questions or posts anything involving quests or lore or anything Is cause and I cannot stress this enough ****IT GETS DOWNVOTED****
---
Check out my last posts, the reasons you don‚Äôt see the real shit is cause it‚Äôs getting buried... blame them.
---
I just started playing last night and this probably the third meme along these lines I've seen. Can someone fill me in on what it means so I don't get shunned?
---
No, he has the solstice boots equipped, and Solstice of Heroes was during Season of Opulence
---
New light player here can confirm
---
Thank you, I'm using this on my phone now
---
That has a double meaning I just realized. Oh God lmao
---
Why don't you use those then?
---
Where is this..... with sound?
---
Lol survival is the best we have had. Imagine if it was countdown. God I‚Äôd never play for glory again.
---
Thanks for the tips
---
Yeah I know haven't played D2 as often as others but either way by the time the Season ends way I'm going about things I'll easily be rank 100
---
That the reason for your downvote? (If it wasn't you I apologise)
---
"Scanners show reinforcements coming." Oh, REALLY?!
---
Wow, a post complaining about something that has nothing to do with the game but instead the sub itself.
---
Welcome to being part of the problem.
---
How despicable.
---
In all seriousness, what was the point of this post?  Your insulting people and expect what? Respect? A pat on the back? If you got an issue with the rules, go talk to a mod or something. But so far, nothing is wrong with what is happening and it's bringing traffic. Create your own channel for like minded people if you prefer but no need to make a post to insult others.
---
15 D2 hunters from russian clan "–¢—Ä–æ—Ü–∫–∏–π –ê—Å—Å–∞—Å–∏–Ω" saw it and added it as desktop ASAP, owner at gamer cafe in Moskva was lol, he is a titan. We all loved it.
---
What an insane grind.
---
Didn‚Äôt downvote my guy/gal
---
I actually got my sweet business catalyst like this last night. After hundreds of full matches grinding for catalysts
---
The u in Savath√ªn is a √ª, not a √π.
---
I use Skullfort so every time I‚Äôm running towards the enemies this is what I imagine they‚Äôre thinking lol
---
Why lie though on such a small matter at all?
---
It‚Äôs everywhere in 5500 comp lmfao
---
Lol maybe because it was 100-46 in a control match? Herp derp idiot
---
Damn...
---
Every time I look at Reddit today I find another one of these lmfao great job with all of these!!
---
Same
---
Thank yo√ª
---
I'm having a complete brainfart and I can't remember which gun that is
---
Make one for titans!
---
Someone please reply yes:(
---
I knooowwww:((((((((
---
For fuck‚Äôs sake hahahaha
---
No worries then for some reason whenever I post anything new someone downvotes it instantly I only discover it when someone comments obviously someone hates me lol (it's not just this community)
---
Beautiful

Just in case you didn‚Äôt know that she‚Äôs real.
---
dumb meme.
---
Probably just a reddit thing
---
It's really good because of the damage boost. Pro tip, your 2nd arrow will land before the damage buff goes on, so the best way to dps is to shoot the first arrow, then throw your grenade, then back to arrow spam, so you maximize damage for the buff.
---
Hey that's me!
---
I'm actually 14
---
Dan James really had a rough game last weekend.
---
Cool I just checked the vent yesterday and it was closed
---
Only ones are the gambit prime armour set. They give role perks, such as a full collector set allows you to collect 20 motes and send a mega blocker (big ol ogre) or full sentry set allows you to see invaders when they invade.
---
Going to be funny to watch people start complaining about hunters and warlocks once OEM is gone. If you're losing to OEM titans now, you'll continue to lose to those same players once they jump to hunter/warlock.
---
Play until a prime engram or any engram drops
---
Black armoury bow is probably your best bet unless you get a world drop one
---
Just head to Ada and pick up the bow frame
---
Alright, thanks!
---
Thanks! I‚Äôll check it out.
---
There isn‚Äôt, there‚Äôs a reason recluse is meta on pc and pretty poo on consoles, but logic be damned
---
Honestly i think it was just luck lmao
---
Thunder coil + knockout + synthoceps is so much fun. I recognize it as pretty cheap but it's too damn fun. I even run it in pve because I just like punching things as a titan lmao
---
my fps drops to like 15 then back to 60, freezing. doesn't do that in any other game mode but prime.
---
:(
---
It is my new favorite bow cause it feels so heavy and even though better options exist in the heavy slot that is still a really fun option
---
BOING
---
badass dude
---
Haven‚Äôt gotten it yet but I am dying laughing üòÇ
---
I'm having the same issue on PC. I bought the $60 shadowkeep expansion, and should have gotten the season pass with it. On my season tab, it says the pass is active, but i cannot get the Leviathan's breath quest, yet i have full rewards on my artefact and access to the raid and shadowkeep itself. What do?
---
I shot a random boss and got it, nice one buddy, the gun is absolutely awesome I you have a melee/dmg build.
---
Also, the gun is insanely good in PVP
---
I did my Darci and Tractor Cannon, so idc, let them
---
The K1 lost sector in Sorrows Harbor kill one of the wizards for the next step load onto the leviathan solo kill all guards with a sniper or bow leave and comeback another 2x then go find Eris
---
The game's like "ya know what... Here, take it"
---
Seasons passes are purchased through silver. So you‚Äôd have to log into her profile and buy it that way. You can‚Äôt directly gift the season.
---
I'm having the same issue on PC. I bought the $60 shadowkeep expansion, and should have gotten the season pass with it. On my season tab, it says the pass is active, and i have full rewards on my artefact and access to the raid and shadowkeep itself, but i cannot get the Leviathan's breath quest. What do?
---
Or when you one two punch the boss and it just dies
---
Tends to happen when you eat crayons and run head first into walls
---
Heaby
---
You need a bow to get the bow frame finished though...
---
You got pretty lucky then. I completed the small questline and bounties on all my toons and almost every match had atleast 1 OeM titan on the opposing team.
---
9/10 times that was accompanied by an Erentil with ridiculous range, a Recluse...or a shotty. Hardly ever got killed by a primary. 
---
Randy's Throwing Knife is making people use scouts here and there but that's gonna fade with time. Can't wait for the OeM nerf though, gonna be a sad day for the titan mains with inflated stats.
---
Lag switching?  Probably not.
---
Oh so I need forsaken to get the last word too?
---
You're supposed to go into the hangar not where banshee actually is
---
alright thanks man, i appreciate it i‚Äôm just now trying to get back into playing
---
Okay thanks
---
I've gotten 3 year one exotics out of 6 nightfalls today. Besides the guaranteed ones, I've yet to get a Y3 exotic drop
---
nah they're just the worst ones
---
Naww, they're just wearing pendants to remind them of the Sanctified Mind!
---
It'd be pretty cool to have a sleek looking armour set like this though ;\_; or civvies
---
Remember, as a grammar Nazi, I was just following orders.
---
I wanted to do a bad Titan symbol in Paint, like it was drawn with crayons, but then I remembered I'm lazy.
---
well now imma try to grind for one of those rolls for sure but i appreciate the feedback. i don‚Äôt know much about godrolls and such.
---
Buy it on the platform you want to play.  Simple.
---
armor?
---
I love using thundercrash BC people are like OHH ANOTHER ONE GET FKD blah blah then they pop their spectral/striker/nova warp and I'm just like 'press Q to delete' lol
---
Edit: another striker titan*
---
What light level are you?
---
Try grinding weapons from menagerie, reckoning and the forges. They have some pretty good guns, like austringer, beloved, tatara gaze (kill clip OHK body shots in pvp), hammerhead, blast furnace, sole survivor, last man standing, spare rations are all great weapons. The rolls you‚Äôre after you could probably find on YouTube but for the sole survivor you‚Äôre after 1/2 punch and sole survivor you‚Äôre after 4th time‚Äôs the charm or triple tap with firing line. These are all very strong perks
---
But I have already bought it on the PS4 before learning about cross play
---
Like all the new mods for armor.
---
You have to talk to banshee before anything, there isn't a prompt but yeah
---
"When you whisper to the void, does it whisper back?"
---
I get it but this is literally just me in the crucible because you can make some INSANE plays with the air dodge, for instance you can dodge around a shotgunner and destroy them.
---
(I know it‚Äôs not impressive)
---
I wonder if eventually they can resurrect after we feed them enough.
---
I got the same gun in the same random fashion...
---
" Here you go, a good exotic ar for you my good guardian"
---
"But why?!?"
---
"Just take it"
---
Thank you for my new background :)
---
Ok thanks!
---
Awww, poor thing. I feel sorry for him:)
---
Good to know.
---
There is no cross play.  There is cross saves where you can migrate your characters from one platform to the other but thats it.
---
Yes I too emote in my bubble waiting for a stupid striker to rush me, just to be met with my shotgun and fists
---
Watching hockey, need to go to bed in an hour.
---
Just wanna power through some Destiny.
---
Kuroko best.
---
Well OEM is for titans who have yet to progress so that‚Äôs perfect
---
Well, with that card you can get highest in all settings and go upto 4k 60fps.
---
I started f2p Sunday and took 17 hours to reach 900. And that's including about 4 hours some friends took me on a raid that we didn't finish showing and showing us mechanics (so basically no gear in that time).
---
I've done it through mostly story and public events with a few strikes thrown in.
---
Apologies, I misread your intent. That aside, unless they fixed it you can do that exotic quest banshee gives you for risk runner, and just farm the Walker at the beginning for a speedy way to 900 without it taking too long. It's not 950 but at least you're at the soft cap and have an easier time of things.
---
I...remember when I was at the top of the leader board.  It has drasticly dropped scince i stopped using bad juju in favor of learning how to use last word
---
Enjoy it man. Turn that FOV up too!
---
I usually just go to shuro with tether and a couple of banners, or grab my helmet with giving hand on it and farm the juju mission, melee kills on the leviathan give you heavy with that mod equipped
---
So you buy it?
---
Love it! Gonna set it for my desktop
---
Your graphics card has to be plugged in separately to power supply. Google says a 6 pin + 8 pin so dont forget to plug that in.
