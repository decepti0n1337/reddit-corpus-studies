I remember getting exotic boots drop, being upset cos I wanted graviton forfeit and then decoding it into bones of eao then never taking them off again.

LOOOO- * backspace  backspace backspace backspace backspace*

Gary
---
Today I got up to 15-something and I can barely breath when the match is loading
---
S c a t t u h
---
I dont know what this means so I feel like I'm doing it without knowing, please educate me
---
Sorry, you pretty much answered this.  But let’s say I got Fabled last season and work on the little bits and pieces for Mountaintop this season, will that count?  Or it all has to be in one season..?
---
What's it gonna be Omnigul?! Death song, or no Death song?!
---
Guy with no invasion armor who has failed to kill somebody yet: *Time to stand by the portal*
---
Probably common sense, but please curb my curiosity.  I got Fabled last season but did not finish the remainder of Mountaintop.  Do I have to get Fabled again this season or will it still count from last??
---
*Nervously Hee-Hee's*
---
solo players are what ruins the game for other solo players unfortunately. Same as queuing Iron Banner - I match against organised teams and have a guy on my team who manages ONE kill. And that was with his super. 
---
This game is absolute trash for any form of PVP activity, Crucible or Gambit because of the gigantic disparity between skill levels and equipment unlocks. A pro raider with 1K voices will absolutely ruin any Gambit team made of blueberries with blue armour. 
---
both awoken and exo are just evolutions of human beings, and at no point did i argue that guardians aren't human. In fact I argues that our guardians are human, and like every human being they need a break. A way to relax. Also if you're so opposed to a racing playlist on the basis that you want lore, racing doesnt mean no lore cards, maybe just ones you dont care about. But clearly your ad hominem  is a superior argument.
---
But how? Iron Banner is a pointless sweatfest. It's actually somehow more full of sweaty tryharding teamstacks than actual Comp. It's everything bad about comp rolled into larger team sizes. 
---
But Johnny didn't get his gun :(
---
Haha I wish this game had a trade system my clan mate who hates bows which I love has gotten Le monarque 3 times I’m at zero and counting lol
---
Which has the better exotics?
---
Yes
---
Not really. They’re still good. It’s just that blade barrage isn’t as popular as it was before. 25% to my super from a single BB kill may not seem like much but it may get you 4 supers in a game where you might’ve only gotten 3
---
The only retroactive step is the five Valor resets within a season. All other steps need to be completed while you're on the step.
---
Could you imagine how long the tower loading screen would be if we were at season 1 launch pop though?
---
I don’t think the spectral blades needs a damage resistance nerf. But the goddamn purple trail it leaves behind is so distracting. I can easily snipe a striker or a nova warp out of their super but spectral blades and their goddamn trail it leaves behind is not okay
---
Bruh that’s ridiculous, that’s for the help 
---
Yes 
---
Legend of Acrius is in a really good spot right now too since it recently got a buff
---
Is there still a lot to do? I lost interest in D1 shortly after TTK because they made the old raids useless. That’s not the case with D2, right? 
---
You misheard. [Here's a list of weapons that work for Riven](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/aymzgi/list_of_highest_damage_weapons_on_riven_the/)
---
Did the buff do it justice? I dont think ive actually used it since laser tag weekend lol
---
Will Shaxx still give the In drops or do I have to farm brother Vance, if we can still get it
---
I don't see a problem
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
As a fellow sword lover...  
---
CAN WE PLEASE GET RANDOM ROLLS WITH OTHER SWORD ARCHETYPES TOO PLEASE?!
---
I want "it stared back" rolls on a quickfang archetype but with heavy or infinite guard. And NOT have it be class locked. 
---
D2 and r6 were revived thanks to ubi and the devs sticking by them. No mans sky... honestly don't know how the devs stuck by that one. But anthem? I don't see EA given bioware the time.
---
Hey is there any point using Shadowshot on the Primeval or does the well already boost your damage the highest it's going to be?
---
I'm worried I've been having my own Kronk moment in Prime each round.
---
Suppose we'll see with b3.
---
What memorable speech did Cayde give? Maybe I missed it.
---
Now that speech Ikora gave *about* Cayde made me tear up 😢
---
That tape to Ikora was touching too, but not a speech.
---
I'm stuck at 68 also....did you fix it?
---
In qp or comp?
---
Qp
---
In fairness, I wasn't the first to post a picture of Cayde with "Avenge the Fallen" overlaid on top (to the best of my knowledge, [this post](https://np.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/b5y1jw/_/) was the first), but I also hadn't seen that post before making mine and I specifically tried to follow the design of the original Endgame posters as closely as possible. I also tried to make mine as mobile-friendly as I could, none of which that first post necessarily did.
---
That said, this is the exact same background image I used (once again, credit to Joseph Biwald on that.) Lol
---
The only thing that gets me is my post was (fairly) removed within an hour of being posted on this sub for being too similar to that first post. Even if I personally feel my post was different enough that it should've been allowed to stay up, the mods were completely justified in removing it, so I didn't mind too much. It does irk me a bit that this was allowed to stay up while mine wasn't, though.
---
u/WistfulAether
---
Gotta be in comp
---
It doesn't count in quickplay. Notice how it says "and earn Glory rank 'Fabled.'" Glory = competitive, valor = quickplay. 
---
Oh shit I'm sorry I just realized
---
It's really just RNG for Cursbreaker. I am working on Dredgen though. 
---
Yeah, get someone who knows how to cheese it. 
---
Nah it's fine. 
---
Never buy the fated engram first xD
---
I always found the aim assist on console to make shots a lot easier.
---
It's an Eververse ornament not from the crucible. Idk if someone answered you correctly or not but you got it because someone in your match popped a 'gleaming boon of the crucible' and this dropped at the end for you.
---
Well big oofs for us
---
[400/500 here](https://i.imgur.com/j33oVkz.jpg) (I didn't play at all on Wednesday cause of work). 
---
I'd strongly recommend Wardcliff coil and going for that power ammo as much as possible; the multi-kill potential is too good to pass up since people usually stack up on points all the time. 
---
it's my second favorite weapon
---
How it works is that the fated engram can give you *any* year 1 gun or armor for your class with the exception of guns that come from quests. 
---
I'm guessing you didn't have Mask of the Quiet one. That's why you got it from the engram. 
---
If you did have Mask of the Quiet one, this means you also have every year 1 item that Xur can give you. You do NOT get duplicates until this happens. 
---
Okey thx. So of I got this right. Weapon only needs 20 higher and average light exactly same as raid for max dmg benefits?
---
You know what it is bitch
---
With a full team you can get full super back without it lol. It’s literally 100% useless in Gambit Prime (tried it, because of the light scaling or something you get none back regardless of what you block), and it’s sorta useful in Reckoning, I get about half back. The rest of the orbs still come from tethers &amp; well warlocks.
---
The live action trailer for Destiny 2. Cayde talked about everyone probably dying and killing then himself if they didn't go and fight. They cried was very underwhelmed but then he brought up loot and they were very enthusiastic. It's also the origin if the Gary meme.
---
I haven’t even done this raid yet :/
---
After many having never gotten Queenbreakers Bow in D1, I finally got the chance to use it when Queenbreaker dropped while playing gambit this week. Also finally picked up Shards Of Galanor from my weekly strike powerful reward, less excited about that drop.
---
Kills with the weapon recharge grenade energy. Using your grenade ability refills the magazine from reserves. I could see it being quite fun on a class with good grenades. It's not particularly useful on my hallowfure Titan, though, since my grenade recharge is already quite fast. Is quite fun to use, though, especially against mobs of vex or thrall.
---
I always wanted this dance back when it first came out during the first festival of the lost. But it wasn't available on last gen consoles.
---
That new mask of amhakara skin is gorgeous. 
---
I actually watched this the other day and my ears perked right up hearing her say that
---
It's to avoid copyright.
---
The worst is truely Taken Blight, cause you end up spending much longer than just popping the bubble right away and nuking the boss
---
Who need gun when Skullfort
---
Destiny 2 remake. Now with janky flying!
---
Cabal online had a /sync to make every dance animation for nearby start again, we could have this here too
---
Fun fact , there is no wizard spartan on here 
---
Agreed. Also,that's some awesome art of the A Thousand Wings.
---
It took me three weeks to get the first step of Malfeasance done, Hell the quest for D1 Thorn was harder than D2.
---
If I have no motes and hear invader I look at my teams tags and go chase the invader why not got nothing to lose if I eat it and best case I get the invader out of there 
---
Demolitionist seems to give varying grenade recharge on kill depending on ammo type. Primary gives a tenth, special gives a fifth, hopefully Doomsday, as the only heavy rolling the perk, allows an ability grenade every third heavy ammo grenade. 
---
OP is hoping that he matches against us and then wins everyone followed his advice and wasted their supers on level 1 goblins
---
As super fun as this, no doubt it’ll get merged soon. Had a blast with bottom arc for titan but that was short lived unfortunately. 
---
Here's the thing, though: I will *always* stop what I'm doing and watch Emperor's New Groove. I can't say the same for Aladdin.
---
These are fucking AMAZING!
---
No. Player base varies on region or what system and time of play but that can only be a issues in very high rank comp.
---
Ps4 has highest player base followed by pc then Xbox.
---
I love when invaders spend a huge amount of time trying to kill my broke ass.  Warms the soul.  FYI   I suck at invading so i stay away from the portal.  I used to feel like a douche but noticed the stats after the match and alot of people don't. 
---
Bring back the emote videos!
---
Its really sad but true
---
Ya they are mountaintop isn’t liked by a lot of people I’ve noticed is has a steep learning curve but it’s my main weapon now even in comp.
---
Saving this for the inevitable argument going into Riven next week
---
is there any site that can tell me which one I didn't get?
---
Justice has been served. 
---
TRIP MINE!
---
I don’t really think they are comparable, at least not in the way anthem and destiny are comparable 
---
Think he meant mage spartan mage/wizard, if i had a guess
---
Yep destiny will be a impossible game to kill nothing can stop us
---
"Vault Hunters Approaching in the distance"
---
well our ride was fun.
---
Finally a cause i can get behind
---
it's really unforgiven
---
I second this 
---
I'd say second easiest is SotP. leviathan and LW are on the same hard difficulty. But that is subjectively
---
Thanks guys I’ll try them both out 
---
I mean it’s pretty fun now since forsaken
---
But no trials, no factions, no weekly rolled weapons, less cool looking armor
---
D1 was great at the end
---
https://i.imgur.com/eJtOZ2W.jpg
---
Also if I may, don’t melt the boss too quick like I did, it doesn’t count if you don’t kill the two knights before finishing it. I didn’t know about them and never even let them spawn lol.
---
What
---
yeah and wasn't that also not good enough cos it was armour and not shader?
---
Why do people care about crap like this- you got to 700 well guess what so did everyone else and thorn isn’t good and your hunter is ugly 
---
Wells would be smart to tank the infinite thralls at the last phase, but I ran nova to nuke both knights to spam orbs for my teammates
---
I knew you were going to mention the Forsaken nonsense dude. I bought forsaken. The core game still looks and feels like old d2. I despise the art design, I cannot stand how sluggish the movement and gunplay is on console, the shader system is awful, the armor design is abysmal. D2 is a complete downgrade from d1. I still to this day, hop on on D1 and just look at the character model wondering wtf happened to Destiny. I mean d1 looked so amazing and felt so smooth. 
---
Wizard chest armor look great and you should grind one with good perk.
---
It’s me :(  I was just mad there’s no No Land Beyond
---
Do anything that gives you "powerful gear". all powerful gear will drop one to ten levels above your current power level. you'll never get gear more than 10 levels above yours. 
---
Reduces your PvE damage from that element. Not sure how much. And the damage you take when in super from all sources. I believe the super damage reduction is 5% per piece.
---
I dont have a mic right now, thats not an issue right? I replaced my headset and Im waiting for the mic+arm to get delivered. I could technically use my headset if its important but would really rather not :P   
---
According to the blurb in the game it just reduces incoming damage whilst your super is active. It’d be cool if incoming damage made orbs magically appear out of your trousers, but perhaps a bit OP
---
These days everything has fucking pouches on it. Fucking pouches. Everything would be 100 times cooler without it.
---
Okay cool, I didn't know the exact "calculation" or whatever behind powerful gear, assumed it was random. Ill make sure that whenever Im getting a powerful gear reward I have my highest power level gear on (sometimes Ill have a lower level handcannon or whatever out of preference but at least for all the dailies that give powerful I can just use whatever is best). Thanks for the info on that.
---
Aw ok cool i thought it helped you generate more orbs lol 
---
I don’t think there’s any way to check. The only way to make sure would just be to play 3 games and know for sure
---
That's really unfortunate, OP. As other comments have said, PC community is a much nicer place. Moreover there's a discord server that accommodates console as well. There's some really cool, nice people there. Matter of fact, just yesterday morning I had to finish my Thorn quest with the Savathun's Song strike. I met the nicest couple of western EU players who - while tough to understand - happily explained and bantered with me as we seamlessly and easily breezed through that content.
---
If you're ever able, I'd highly advise coming over to the PC side. As a long-time console player the shift in community toxicity in my experience is night and day.
---
Better luck going forward, my guy.
---
Eater of worlds is the easiest by far, with last wish and spire of stars being the hardest mechanically, and scourge having the most challenging combat simply due to high light levels in my opinion
---
Not if you're not wearing the armor for it no. That's the point of GP
---
That mask looks so much cooler there than it does in game.
---
Shame. Thanks :) 
---
I get your point. But there are some places where your point is um... weird
---
1. A person missed a week and didnt have enough time to get up to 700. Maybe he wants to get the gear sets or the weapons? 
---
2. We lvl up our light because we can. Its 700. Reckoning and other activities count. Its not only about IB. Some people just want to take it slow and not be a grinder 
---
Oh man. I feel you on a level most blueberries could never understand. Are you an Xbox player? I will team up. 
---
I burns my soul
---
That looks dope
---
No problem!

made this just for people who wanted to find it!
---
There’s a second one in the annex as well.
---
They nerfed Nova Warp in PvP to give Warlocks this.Let us have our fun in PvE
---
very true, i've been to that one also. Just made a vid on this one specifically because of the last video I had. Both are nice little cozy spots.
---
Siiiiick
---
You understand me 
---
yep but $10
---
Not that dope haha
---
Where is that one? 
---
Y’all we should agree on a date where we all meet up on titan and dance synced
---
Using your exotic perk as intended shouldn't be considered "cheese". 
---
how does that cheese taste?
---
When you land at the annex pad it’s up to the right. You have to do a weird little jump out and up to get to it. Hard to explain for me anyways. Maybe someone has posted a video or might be able to better explain here than I am. 
---
Yeah I do the same but with nova bombs on the pikes 
---
add me khul#2259, if you are a pc player.
---
Got three 1k Voices in my first three runs :&gt;
---
I hated that the armor was just reskinned from PoE. Thought the armor itself was ugly as hell, and the taken part was the only reason I wore it. But a shader would be way better 
---
you right. Just noticed.
---
The engrams were a bitch to make
---
I hate you
---
Sorry, I should have preceeded my comment with 'very nice work' 
---
its allright.
---
Always open for critique tho
---
There already is one
---
Put on full revire dawn set an pop a tincture, it makes your entire body that taken glow effect, only problem is its heavy on tinctures
---
I finished the Thorn crucible quest same match, just have  the strike to do.
---
Hell...let's just do taken king redux
---
Sbmm. A lot less cannon fodder available for good players in iron banner. We are all off playing each other as solos.
---
fucking legendary my dood
---
Sea of Thieves has everyone sync up their music. It's be great if we could sync our dances like that
---
Chimchank, Dregferno, and... Capternape?
---
I did it solo for probably 75 percent of it. Using all sorts of gear. Use what you're good at, and you will get the gun. Just play for the win. Always. Your life is less important than the life of the team. A good solo should know that
---
it’s not tht hard to get kills and play the objective 🤷‍♂️
---
Time to get a 3d printer, literally the only way for me to get lunas 
---
I remember back in D1 when Gallaghorn could wipe it an entire fallen skiff before they even dropped 
---
Me too. Most of my deaths are either due to extensive collaboration or turning the corner to instantly die from Spectral Blades/shotgun to the face. I'd say I have a good situational awareness but since I'm relatively new to D2 (stopped playing D1 since House of Wolves) and that I'm not used to the maps yet that could be why. But when I'm familiar with the map and back more competent players up in gunfights then my KDA usually hovers between 1-3.
---
Here is a nice tip from someone who sucks to get your ka/d averages way up.  
---
firstly, i know you might think this is useless, but in a gun fight, every bullet counts.  
---
Follow someone and stay back.  Use a longer range gun.  If you have a lot of distance, use a scout even.
---
shoot what your team is shooting at.  even if you arent the one who gets the kill, your bullets helped win that gun fight, and you get an assist kill.  your stats will go up and it will help your team win.  
---
anytime you do anything with your team working together, you will end up in a better place.
---
“The Nine deem you... unworthy.”
---
4 mans can definitely be beat, but with matchmaking the way it is sometimes you match up with people way out of your skill level and it's just a train wreck after that. you get stuff like people reaching KD of &gt; 20 in a game of clash and you can't leave early even when it's blatantly impossible to win. the longer those games drag on the shittier you feel and if you get matched against the same opponents, you're shit outta luck
---
No shame in a .47 KD. As long as you're having fun and not intentially dying for fun then that's ok. People who usually do well in PvP tend to look down on those who aren't performing as well and that's a toxic attitude. Somedays I have a .33 KD (I say some days but it's this most of the time) and other days I have a KD of 3-5. 
---
Iron Banner has made me see some things. Things that shake me to the core. A level 20 was on my team once, and they ended with a .07 KDA. Not KD; All-encompassing KDA. 
---
my complaints on spectral blades:  
---
* are is too big
---
* you can left click with barely taking any super energy off
---
* too much damage resistance 
---
* too fast  
---
I hate how powerful I feel using spectral blades in comp, really needs nerf.
---
What about 7 Guardians?
---
keep spamming apply
---
Scourge or Eater of Worlds
---
When you have one gun, but also a bunch of attachments.
---
Our emotes will blot out the sun 
---
Got Thorn and my Dregden title in the same week. All my Light Vs Light kills were before the change so it feels legit to me.
---
You can't equip 2 exotics...
---
 Wouldn’t it be cool if we got a prestige dreaming city with a 1k voices skin and an animated shader and armor that has the aesthetic of the chattering bone type weapon 
---
Noooooo. Destiny 2 had 3 months of content even for most of the hardcore. It wasnt until COO came out, with which most people thought would inject a new swathe of content to conquer, but didn’t, that it was revealed d2 vanilla was in a bad state. But the base set of d2 content was adequate until coo. It just wasn’t adequate AFTER coo, but the game was still predicated on doing the base content. 
---
Yea, the crazy ones are the people that get offended enough by that to downvote you.
---
I use the skull aswell sometimes but I can admit that it is kind of a joke that you get that VERY high AoE damage ability with basically no cooldown
---
Haha when we’re out of college that’s the plan :)
---
I don't get this...
---
We need the taken Armor from D1 back
---
Your opinion doesn't matter, Sweeper bot
---
god dammit
---
Use this as a fake portal for blueberries to try and steal
---
Yeah, if I'm talking with others but I'm playing a story game I always mute them whenever there's a cutscene or lore
---
I wanna
---
I am
---
I feel like we could have done more, especially with what Pulled Pork did.
---
If you want to have fun in crucible, use the DIM randomize feature.
---
It sucks in the crucible, I don’t have it but after getting two tapped and the poison effect kills you
---
literally last night
---
How about you go 1v6 against me and five of my friends and see if you get a positive K/D? See if you’re all that good of a player. I’m not even that GOOD of a PvP guy, but when I’m playing with people at or above my skill level and we adequately communicate, there’s an increase in efficiency for me and many other people. When you stack with blueberries and no comms, against people who do communicate well, chances are you’re not going to do well, regardless of skill level. You’re probably the guy who pulls out Telesto or spams Jotunn when he starts getting his shit pushed in, which is understandable, but doesn’t make you a good player.
---
Wait...you're supposed to capture in IB and not just kill opponents?
---
Which hand cannon?
---
Yeah that's masterworks on weapons, Year 1 weapons could be PvP or PvE rolled and rerolled for the right perk, while Year 2 weapons are fixed upon dropping and come between levels 1 and 10, getting to 7 adds a kill tracker and 10 lets it generate orbs, they will roll with a boost to one of the perks, e.g. Reload speed, impact etc
---
Why would you steal kills in a raid?
---
Its a crucible match... I find a guy just standing there. I start to shoot.. But just cant kill him. I push him he pushes back.. I wave... We start dancing... Then his teammate shoots me. Was so fun... I gotta say.... 
---
Well that means around 1.8Milioon different weapons still nowhere near 1 billion
---
Few tips for ya Guardian:
---
1. Always specify platform when looking for other players.
---
2. Check the rules before posting as LFG is not allowed here.
---
3. If you're on xbox I can maybe do it with you this weekend sometime.
---
4. Good luck!
---
I never really understood this one. I use missile titan with skullfort and its frickin awesome in pve. You get your super back REALLY fast. Melting point is a huge help in encounters because it buffs ALL damage by 50% instead of only void damage getting that buff (Tractor Cannon) and the other elemental damage be buffed by 33%. It opens up more damage potential bc Celestial Nighthawk GG is a solar ability. Plus you can use Hallowfire Heart to get your abilities back faster.  Hammer of Sol is great for ad clear too. I don't think I need to explain all this to another guardian, but why is this argument going around in the community?
---
Okay, that's kind of what I figured. I'm anxious to see what they can do without the publisher having the last say on every decision.
---
This dude: "hol'up lemme get my forsaken exotic that doesn't exist on back to flex on these blueberries real quick."
---
You do realize that playing 1v6 makes no sense?
---
And no, I am using pulse rifles for long distances, luna for short distances, and tractor cannon.
---
But let's just stop making assumptions, alright? I speak from my experience, simple as that. I have negative efficiency maybe in one out of ten such games. My sincere apologies for doing that.
---
I also apologize for trying to encourage players to play vs 6 stacks instead of abandoning all hope and making poor excuses.
---
I think if drifter turns on us, we can take him.
---
Nah you got this, it is annoying but I got it on my tenth completion and then never got it again and now I’m at a lot more, about 46 completions with about 40 of them being powerful frames
---
Are you sure it wouldn’t make sense? All you’d have to do is fall back. And with your exceptional levels of experience you’d surely do well against people that range from 1.2-2.0 KDA 🤷🏽‍♂️
---
The only thing about the “nerf” which made it any semblance of a nerf is that - sans sniper scav and reserves - it takes two heavy pickups to get the white nail proc rolling 
---
Looks great! 
---
Task failed successfully.
---
That is a big flaw then. Bc an improved overshield shouldn't give a guardian more health than a heavy slot sniper headshot can deal damage. If this is working as intended, then all it proves is that there were tons of complaints from scrubs who cant invade crying about getting their head blown off. 
---
Thank you!

I generally agree with you, except if you consider the players who stick with it, not because theyre having fun, but because they're hoping it gets better. In the meantime, they spend a lot of time grinding just trying to keep up. That's not having fun.   
---
You're almost better off NOT playing if the DLC doesn't have anything new you like, and then using the free leveling token (or whatever they give us next time) to bring yourself back up to somewhere close to the previous cap. 
---
I meant if he thought tethering was bad and you start tethering everything maybe he should pay attention. 
---
What happened? Like what part is the best
---
yeah i heard that, it's more so no one wants to teach me or do it during times i can xD
---
Wow who asked you to come along toxic boi?
---
It's a heavy sniper headshot. There should be no need for a follow up. It's a SNIPER precision shot. Had I known that this bullshit was a thing, a follow up shot woulda came and this post would've never happened. No over shield should give a guardian damn near double health points. If it's as intended it needs looked at.

# Trust.
---
They did buff them a few months back and they're in a good spot for what they are.
---
I find hand cannons to be the best for comp because they have a bit better range and can more consistently teamshot. But recluse is a beast in quickplay where people are less organized
---
I think out of all the crucible exotic quests, Thorn is the best in pve. I don't like it much for pvp, though. 
---
continue doing these
---
Booooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
---
ah the irony...
---
Wings of Sacred Dawn for Warlocks. I've only seen one other person use it in Crucible, but it's worked well for me to avoid the shotgun around the corner or noobtubers.
---
Oh cool another person dragging race issues into where they don't belong. 
---
Hes not doing the default fortnite dance literally unwatchable
---
ORBY! Noooooooo!
---
That's not what irony is basic redditor
---
Bungie doesn't go here. 
---
But yes, many people are underwhelmed by scout rifles. Others think they are fine. It depends what you use them for. 
---
As someone who has played all 3 I can say I like warlock the most in PVE and titan in 2nd PVP is hunter then titan. The group I play with had a mix but recently all swapped to hunters for comp and and manage to get 3-5 streaks going pretty easily  
---
What is this a wizard room
---
BofA and ligma
---
Yes, they couldn't have found a more fitting name to it, haven't done it myself.
---
Don't listen to 1k hours in qp feedback, just get used to the game..again :)
---
Some people go to qp/rumble before comp on purpose, to stretch and warm up, treat is same way. I understand your frustration, but as our lord and savior CammyCakes spoke: learn to have fun, and not how to get better. You'll get the gun. Just take it easy.
---
I’ll give you that, 100+ is also very impressive and most players can’t do. If you are being truthful, I’d like to pull back the blueberry comment. But this is also where we have differing experiences. I play with 2-3 other players typically and we all have roles. Each of them are as good at their roles as I am at mine. I can play knowing that they will wreck the pve portion without my super being needed as long as I keep the other team from ever invading. Typically we don’t get an invasion until we’ve summoned the primeval. So for me, it’d be moronic not to use my super, because it’s not needed on my home side.
---
Aids and ebola
---
It's iron banner with the new Iron burden.
---
Yep
---
Since sunshot is a year 1 ecotic attainable by everyone mid way through the campaign it shouldnt ever be in xurs inventory. This is unacceptable lol.
---
It's less now, [here is the proof](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/b4ytj4/protect_the_runner_now_requires_less_than_100/)

&gt;Reports: It's targeted harassment @ me
---
What harassment? This is one of my favorite posts in the sub ever. Theres no harassment. It's *obviously* staying.
---
The 0 one was from the start, the 10 mote one got sent in last round. 
---
Sad how everything is racist now
---
Archon Priest would be stunlocked with Black Hammer. He'd never leave that pad in front of his cell.
---
That moment when you look down and all you can think or say is "Ah, shit. This isn't going to end well. Did I write that will when I was told to? Meh, time to get off the pot. At least this will be quick."
---
“Whisper is ~~useless~~ not great because even though I land my headshots it bugs out half the time and I don’t get White Nail”
---
/-Me
---
I got Aids &amp; No Brakes. 
---
Well, this is a joke about racism/race issues. Are you really shocked when people say "look, someone bringing up race issues"? 
---
And no, people finding it unfunny are not being racist against you. 
---
PANIC!
---
It's a known bug. The Vow can't be infused above 650.
---
Which isn't so bad, because the Vow is terrible and you shouldn't use it. 
---
Eh, I like it.
---
How would you buff it?
---
Here, here, watch, E'll do it with my eyes closed.
---
First clip is indeed IB, but the one with a power level disadvantage is me, as you can see melee not oneshotting.
---
150s are good, still need a pve buff, but all other archetypes are trash imo and are completely outclaessed by pulses
---
Ursa Furiosa is incredibly useful in Last Wish 
---
Yeah but like......loot. I need shiny loot to protect people. 
---
Good point. Minor detail: Don't you get graviton lance later? I have Sunshot and Graviton Lance.
---
Juggernaut is powerful, but easy to shut down if you know where he is, which you often do since he makes a ton of noise and puts on a light show. Nothing broken about the super honestly. Spectral Blades are invisible, and have remarkably high damage resistance, combined with being spammable makes it aggravating. 
---
So yes, because of i am a solo players, i deserve ddos attacks, 1v4 or 2v4 servers and lose points for nothing. Okay.
---
&gt;I usually don’t report people 
---
Your words not mine 
---
You say that now, but they directly addressed this in the TWaB
---
Team is simple enough, if you can’t find an LFG just make one, it’ll suck, but it’ll work. Time, yeah, can’t help you there lol, sorry
---
I use bygones cause I don't have a good blast furnace 
---
When playing through the base game campaign, you can chose one out of the three (sunshot, riskrunner, graviton lance). If you make three characters and actually go through the story with them all, you would be able to get all three that way. If you use the level 30 character boost, you don't get to pick one of those three. 
---
Yea no your right I love using hallow for heart, being a melting point bot, and never using my super. Titan is so much fun. 
---
I reported the 0 mote one for inactivity (not like he'll even get a warning tho), because, like I said, he was in team from the start and did nothing but stay back at spawn.
---
I don't really undestand what you are blaming me for. I'm sad cause I didn't get the triumph I eagerly wish to obtain as a solo player, and yes, I am blaming that 0 guy for being inactive AND not leaving. 
---
Again, you don't want to do the thing that would make it infinitly easier to grind out, which is get help. You're bound and determined to.domit your way and your way only. I get you're a solo player. Solo matchmaking in comp is ridiculously bad. There's a solution to your problem but you don't want to do it that way. So yes, as a solo player, you're probably going to fail. Deal with it. 
---
In D2 Vanilla, Leviathan weapons were the only ones with ambitious assassin. 
---
Yeah I started playing warlock like just under 3 weeks ago so yeah half my luck I was punch bro back then but ah well I’ve taken my warlock from 0-700 with both gambit weapons 21% and malfeasance in that couple weeks so it will come around I’m sure 
---
they should make Ascendant ornaments for the DC armor so we can look Taken all the time. I love the way the armor looks on the hunter but bc the ugly brown doesn't change I cant wear my usual metro shift with it. Whoever decided to put unchangeable parts on armor needs to be fired. 
---
See, this is why i need to get off my lazy ass. If i doodle something like that out of boredom it turns out like poo. I need to practice lol
---
Man you were sitting on 15 I would have done the same thing find the biggest rock offer blood sacrifice to RnGsus and pray I didn’t eat shit and lose all those sweet sweet motes lol
---
Damn. That’s me rn... to the T.. 
---
Easier*, I'd say, if you have tools for that. Both have high DR and spammable attacks, like you can see me use them to get in and out of cover, hp on kills lets you keep momentum and sometimes survive pretty ridiculous odds.
---
Lol, you guys deserver all of this, i understand it now. I am saying real 1v4, not 3 other bad players+ me, just me in whole team, and u still saying it is your problem. I am playing 4v4 in a solo mode, it is matchmakings fault and still punishes me with rank decrease, and u say yeah deal with it. Bungie should never fix any bugs, because u guys always find a way to blame others for its bugs. 
---
But they had to choose between actual perks or AA. Midnight Coup would be even better if it had AA on top of Rampage/Outlaw.
---
Nope I don’t give a shit I just want exotics 
---
After Cayde dying i just wanted to go on a murderfucker revenge quest, even after bodying Prince Emo i just wanted to keep going. I miss Cayde.
---
Who died and made you batman
---
Wrath of the Wachine*
---
I was thinking of a joke about "stairs" and wanted to ask you where the elevator is. But the raid indeed has an elevator :/
---
Also, Spire of stars is not friendly to newbies. Everyone has to be aware and working. The prestige version is the hardest PvE activity imo.
---
But I'm not friends with cayde because I was late an he died because of me I could never have as good as a friend as him if i could t even help him out I'm not work it
---
Bit we need the shiny loot to protect the people
---
[removed]
---
I’d been waiting for foetracer! I speak as a one guardian guy
---
The fact that the engram gave me gauntlets, however...🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
---
That has to be it. I don't really remember but I just checked the wiki and it said that this can drop randomly. Guess I was unusually lucky then. Sorry for the confusion.
---
It doesnt happen too often thankfully but when it does it sucks
---
ACCESS CODES TO THE ZION MAINFRAME
---
I got foe tracer way early in the game and I also got gauntlets with the engram
---
Mine hasn’t come yet but dude it looks good!
---
Oh god, if you’ve been able to make this...... I don’t want to think of what the r34 sfm artists have done...
---
You need better friends XD
---
When I realize I’m wrong I just say “ignore me I’m a dumbass” and we all laugh it off. It’s not hard to have fun while raiding lmao
---
You should be able to get there. Just take it slow at that level you can easily carry some of the game modes. 
---
No. It's not a Gambit match. 
---
ANTMAN?
---
What? Black hammer was easily better than either of those. Flip it maybe? 
---
Usually it's when you don't time your shots and spam tf out of it. Like in morgeth, big ass crit target so people think they can spam the shots, the recoil is manageable but when you're spamming it you kind of miss one crit, then consider mulligan affecting the shot thinking they got 3 in a row and it's going to continue. Aka people are oblivious to their own flaws and has to blame the game mechanics. Even if the game isn't perfect, Im pretty confident that the mulligan and the missed shot is what's canceling the white nail proc. That's why people think it's a bug cause in their head they refuse to accept or are unaware of the fact and gotta go surfing for a reason like mechanic, when mulligan only sometimes procs, as intended. So denial in the end imo, its funny hearing people talk about its bugged vs those who know they missed and can admit it. 
---
I’ve done two raids; Leviathan and Spire of the Stars. I can’t imagine trying to fake knowledge of either one. At least the group I ran it with were aware that I was a first-timer, so they were incredibly patient. Now I need to run the prestige SotS, because I want the sleeper catalyst.
---
Even through all the lore about him, I have a very hard time believing that his fighting skills are anywhere close to/match ours (lore wise).
---
Great clip mate, you wrecked “havoc” back there hehe.. 
---
But the thing is any competent player can take down fist of havoc easily, you don’t get the damage reduction Spectral blades have. 
---
This
---
Only cowards don't use sidearms to invade
---
Go to destiny tracker and check game history. It has dates and game type
---
It doesn't take long to get the Ikelos hand cannon. It's not like the other Ikelos weapons that you have to farm EP for. It is given to you near the beginning of the Sleeper Simulant quest. 
---
The reason people recommend Ikelos is its fast rate of fire. Spare Rations from Zavala has the same fire rate, if you are any closer to getting that one. 
---
I do it for the puppies 
---
No I don't thibk it's possible in any way. 
---
What you call a problem, I call fun.
---
Naaaah im just here for the loot
---
No
---
TACTICAL NUUUUUKKKEEE
---
Foetracer is worthless
---
Charge time, slower projectile, cover, strafing,  running perpendicular to the projectile makes dodging effective,  and exotic slot use.
---
These are why I think it's okay.
---
To make it heavy you'd have to up the damage a lot, increase projectile speed by 2-3x, and improve tracking.
---
33 frames,1 exotic drop,lemon arque,a bow i don't like
---
I solo grinded for a week to get recluse and it's my favorite PvE weapon. Also yeah dont get tilted, I have won many games that were 0-3 and came in for that sweet 4-3 win.
---
For real tho?
---
**Virtually** being the key word in my assessment.
---

I used a character boost so I love this lol
---
wait, aren't titans pretty useful now already, Ward of Dawn for Reckoning, Banner shield for Raids, mini thunder crash and  Infinite supers for Ad clears,  Melting point...etc...
---
Have fun with the picking up 15 motes in three seconds or less. Ive had every gambit triumph for months except that one at 2/3 it's azz
---
Classic
---
Wow, I just realized that liar's handshake + One two punch (last man standing shotgun) 
---
deal over 3x the damage of a headshot from whisper LMAO
---
Alright, thanks for clearing it up. Also I got the ship for gambit badge, so all I need is to reset 2 more times for Dredgen
---
Looks like console, that's probably why you can get so many kills.
---
People on PC will shred you in your super.
---
Not a diss, but an observation.
---
Most of the time its intentional.
---
Lord Shaxx is a great motivator, 10/10! Would play Crucible again.
---
I miss it so much but I dont think they can implement on the 4v4 style of small maps they made, some of the newer ones are bigger but that still might be a push
---
You can, Guardian! Believe in what you do!
---
\[NA\] PC

Just got back into D2 after a long hiatus and switched to PC. Need 1 to run the forge with.

wont double your chances but will increase your chances in getting special ammo .
---
Oh man if I used the prenerf nova warp there on the last guy, he wouldn't have even put me on crit, I'd just teleport through the fire. The good old days...
---
Thanks man! Try your best, Guardian! Nothing can stand in our way!
---
Get out of here with that crap. 
---
Must be nice. My Girlfriend hates video games. 
---
She. And you’re right, I should’ve used Ding. 
---
Panic super lucky 4 bag lol but nice use of the F key nonetheless
---
You need to throw grenades more. Never hold back, Guardian. 
---
Everyone disliked that......also boo!!!
---
That right there ain’t wife material, ya hate to see it.

Username checks out. My bad

No one would be forced into microtransactions and at no point did I remark that Bungie should add more micro transactions. I did however, I did claim it would encourage players to purchase microtransactions that are already present in the game. But as you clearly point out and admit, Bungie shouldn't waste their time on novelty items and activities that don't add any story to the game. So by the same property they shouldnt waste their time on new cosmetic shaders, new ships, new sparrows, new ghost shells or anything that isn't directly story related. If you can't see that your argument is already moot by the fact that micro-transactions already exist in Destiny, and Bungie commits a great deal of resources to cosmetic item design, then there's nothing left to talk about. Simply put,I Get it, you don't want SRL back because it offers nothing for you, that's fine. But with Destiny being an MMO, its not about what YOU want instead of SRL, but what the community wants and what will make Bungie the most money long term.
