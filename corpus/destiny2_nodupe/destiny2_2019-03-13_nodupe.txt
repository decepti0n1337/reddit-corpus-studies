üòÇ yup
---
---
---
It does oddly enough.
---
The core mechanics are good but it's very clearly unfinished and will need a massive total overhaul of the loot system.
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I almost feel weird saying it but for all its faults in y1 at least Destiny 2 was a complete game on launch. 
---
You ever think that sometimes their internet just shits itself? I'm sure people also wouldn't leave comp so much if pvp in this game wasn't complete shit but yeah, let's always get upset at our teammates over a game that's such a minor thing in everyday life
---
Thank you so much. I couldn‚Äôt find a distinction even though I knew the wording. 
---
Yep. January patch:
---
The damage is now heavily weighted on the delayed explosion instead of the knife impact
---
Now deals self-damage if the knives explode too close
---
Fixed a bug where the knives would track allies
---
Are either of you using a void HC?
---
Either way the Drifter directly murdered 3 Guardians.
---
Its been a while since i have been down that way in the EDZ. Felt like i was being shown a new area entirely. 
---
So basically you're crying about it until you get to use it. Stop your whining and get good at the game. It's completely possible to beat OEM users lmao you act like a team with a single OEM is undefeatable.
---
Drifter is a weak punkass. My Hunter is Vanguard all the way.
---
(My Titan is probably drifting though. She crazy.)
---
Made for a thumbnail for the location of where to start the Thor quest!, I'll link it when it's uploaded.
---
Cool motive, still murder.
---
I vote we start a new thread where everyone with a 666 piece of gear can show it off.  So many every god dang day.
---
The quest did become time locked. Instead, the weapon was put into the exotic drop pool. So it was basically the quest that was time locked, not the gun.
---
I thought I read the patch notes..did they buff the drop rate again?
---
Same happened to me 
---
did you kill both Knights before finishing off the shrieker?
---
I love spinning around to catch incoming invaders.
---
Lol snitch‚Äôs get stitch‚Äôs 
---
What is the light level requirement for the mission 
---
That was  beautiful
---
You got the aspic in your lips?

---
well i think they patched the drops today as well so the powerful upgrades will be powerful until 690 then it goes to the +1 thing.
---
Dunno, most of these were from dreaming city bounties/activities btw including a celestial nighthawk and 2 sunshots I got just before believe it or not
---
we killed everything 
---
Its impossible to miss. Yet somehow people do. Its bigger than a Well of Radiance and glows bright bright ass white that makes the title screen look dark
---
Awww man, I took a break from the game and missed that. Thanks for letting me know! I might have to look at void builds now or something

So you befriended a more sour Zavahla, Chris is lame the Colonel told me so.
---
That was criticism, but was not at all constructive.

too bad shes a lesbian
---
Drifter has so far gotten around ten Guardians killed in Gambit (Prime), and when confronted with this he basically just went, "Shame." Dude may be trying to save humanity but he's selfish and willing to do whatever it takes to achieve his goals. Even one of the developers said Drifter doesn't love the Hero of the Red War, he only loves what they do for him.
---
So yeah obviously I still love the guy but he's 100% asshole. 
---
Lesson (maybe) learned, dont bunch up, ESPECIALLY in close quarters. 
---
Gotcha. I just did crucible for all the steps so I wasn‚Äôt sure. Thanks for the clarification.
---
Dredgen Yor, the owner of the Thorn, was a Titan.
---
üëç didn‚Äôt mean to come off condescending 
---
What shaders are you using on this set?
---
true, just completed it and the mission popped, thanks everyone!
---
I really thought they were going to have everything good from destiny 1 and more , boy was I disappointed and mad 
---
It‚Äôs on the uk store in the deals section at the moment, ¬£20 instead of ¬£30, or just pull down on destiny pick on dash, and look at add ons, it‚Äôs there I purchased it this morning 
---
Same here. Just 3 pieces of lore. Huge disappointment
---
No, no we don't.
---
I have, many times. Hence this comment. 
---
T H I C C
---
kinda epic
---
It's a PvP weapon so kinda comes with the territory 
---
Shaxx invented the crucible to train young guardians after the Battle of Six Fronts. Too many casualties. We needed new troops. He also formed the RedJacks to find and secure crucible areas. 
---
Cayde was not friends with the drifter. He ran in his circle for a spell, but never said they were buddies. IIRC, he had some strong feelings against the drifter when you play through the Ace of Spades mission.
---
Have you tried jumping into comp with a void weapon you are comfortable with? Sure it wont be as fast as using a void hc, but it is still significantly faster than playing quickplay.
---
Should add killing envoys too not just this.
---
You won't need 100 games at all, if you play somewhat average already.
---
I'm by no means above average in PvP and still manage to get 3-5% per match, which would mean it takes 20-30 matches.. which is perfectly fine for a exotic quest. On top of not being able to actually loose progress and having void handcannons available easily (forge / ikelos).
---
From personal experience rumble is  a better mode over quick play. You should try rumble for a change it really helps with skill. You will find players with similar skills to you. 
---
If it's a PvP weapon then they shouldn't have put three quest steps with PvE options first. Had all of them just been crucible steps I never would have bothered in the first place.
---
Sadly all I see so far is titans and hunters
---
Haven‚Äôt picked up the quest. Lmao. Can you give me some tips?
---
For people who want context: This is referencing the lorebook, "The Man With No Name." Drifter was pretending to be a commoner and live among some villagers when an Iron Lord used them as bait to kill a Warlord, resulting in the entire village being slaughtered. During that, this happened:
---
&gt;Through it all, the Ghost saw \[Drifter\] emerge out of the discharge of an errant explosive device, cradling the body of a child. He moved to relative safety behind one of the shacks and knelt down, holding an ear to the child's face. She was trying to speak. 
---
I guess this is what she was trying to say. 
---
If you didn't want me to side with the Drifter then you shouldn't have been so careless with your life. I'm like an angsty teenager lashing out. Maybe I want to hurt myself. 
---
I don't have the refexes to handle PvP anymore. I don't know what happened but over the last few months I have turned into dogshit in every PvP game I play.
---
Yeah, I think that‚Äôs the only way to get it. The game didn‚Äôt even tell me she had it. I panicked momentarily because I thought I didn‚Äôt get the package.
---
You‚Äôre good bro üëç
---
I can help this weekend if your still having trouble, I still need to do the forges I‚Äôm lvl 655
---
How‚Äôd you do the strike?
---
The Paxil Order is willing to kill for ‚Äúthe greater good‚Äù. Sounds very Hunger Games to me....
---
Heh I‚Äôm in the top 17% it says on mine
---
What are blueberries?
---
Nobody died in regular gambit
---
Who's the one asking for mercy? The Super, or the enemy team...
---
Answer: Blade Barrage
---
He doesnt mean it. Dude take it back!  Take it back!  He means , um, the ..... laser tag meta. Yeah that! He means that. 
---
Join the Drifter, we have exotics!
---
*Laughs in Blade Barrage*
---
Something to do with vex alternate realities?
---
Where else? Difter.
---
Word logic.
---
0.7 is a persistently good ttk, if you are comparing it to last word, which has an abnormally fast ttk, but only at very close range. If you are accurate with Luna‚Äôs you can 3 tap at almost all of the ranges you will be fighting. And, I believe I‚Äôm right in saying that 0.5 is the optimal trek of lw? The optimal ttk of Luna‚Äôs is 0.33. And you won‚Äôt be hitting the 0.5 with lw all of the time, that requires 2 headshots and a body shot, firing the gun at full auto which is almost impossible for me because I play on console. You don‚Äôt need to land shots in a row, you need 4, two to activate mag howl, and two to kill the person. After you activate mag howl, you only need to land one headshot and one body. I have about 3000 kills with my Luna‚Äôs, I would say about 200-300 of those have been two taps. They don‚Äôt always happen, but even when they don‚Äôt, the gun has an acceptable ttk, and more range than people give it credit for. Even when you get out of range, if you activate mag howl, you can 4 tap, which is still a competitive ttk, or else normal 180s, like trust wouldn‚Äôt be competitive,, which they are. Flinch is perfectly controllable, if you are having trouble with it, throw on some unflinching armor perks. When your fighting, if you are being smart, you should never even be able to see two enemies at once, then they can‚Äôt shoot you. If you want to get a two tap, hit someone twice, then move on to someone else and two tap them. 
---
PS I meant to type mag howl(magnificent howl) but it must have been auto corrected.
---
At the very least a war would leave the city more vulnerable to attacks from Cabal/Hive/Fallen
---
I'm pretty sure it was Shaxx who said "they cant kill you if you dont play!" Or something like that.
---
Vanguard.
---
I‚Äôve been blastin brains across the galaxy since 2014 for the vanguard. How many gods and heathens have I killed for the vanguard? My apparently best friend Cayde-6 fought and died for the vanguard, the thing he believed in. The patrols I go on to keep the galaxy safe, and my fellow guardians shoulders lighter, that‚Äôs all for the vanguard. The Vanguard is the frontlines of humanity in this universe and as a glorious hero etched into the grimoires of time, it‚Äôs my honor to stand by what I‚Äôve been fighting for for so long.
---
Plus Drifter is a shady ass mother fucker who came out of no where. Never trusted him for shit and I definitely trust him less after being asked to pick sides.
---
Where do I check that?
---
Trade off for not being foced to maintain a positive kd.
---
I know, really, and I'm pretty sure it's how it's gonna turn out to be in the end. But still I'll stand proud for my dear Vanguard. Shaxx alone is worth it.
---
Random teammates. Their icons on the minimap are a blue circle, like blueberries. I take it you didn't play D1? Or atleast weren't a big part of the community outside of the actual game?
---
I mean the thorn pvp stuff is by far the easiest pvp related quest step just takes long. 
---
Look up time wasted on destiny then enter your username 
---
Hopefully something horrific
---
Yuppppp, it only counts in Gambit Prime 
---
Can you please repost without spoilers in title and a spoiler tag please.
---
Post removed.
---
I'd rather lose progress for death and actually make progress than take 3 matches for 7%
---
both are pvp based???
---
I didn't really see that....like only the end was PVP based
---
compared to last word
---
Thorn was not that PVP based.
---
Never apologize for Iron Maiden. 
---
Jesus Christ I never ever ever would've known that. THANK YOU. I don't care about spoilers at all, people get way to amped up over that stuff 
---
I feel ya lad.
---
I mean, Cayde wasn't exactly the biggest fan of the vanguard system either
---
All the things people say are impossible to get
---
I am not his SO, but I am his heterosexual life partner ;)
---
He only died because of the time he took to switch back to golden gun.
---
Ohhh ok. But I don‚Äôt remember Hadium Flakes being hard to get, but they‚Äôre up there.
---
What about the ghost shell
---
Nah, he wasn't that close to Drifter, but called the Vanguard "the best bet I ever lost".
---
No matchmaking I'm afraid, I had to LFG it
---
5-6 shots? you need to stop aiming for the chest mate
---
I sided with the drifter because the vanguard refused to help exact revenge on cayde
---
I almost forgot this guy. Is there literally no way to go back and fight him without deleting a character?
---
And I am no friend of Drifter
---
You calm down there Drifter, I'm just trying to bring my own morality and values into question
---
Hmm... I went vanguard, did you go drifter? I just watched a video and it said it's prime only for vanguard. 
---
Too late.
---
What strat did you use to finish it? I got stuck on it for like 45 mins then had to get off
---
Or just use Ace and any other void weapon that you like. Not that much worse.
---
Literally one of the most wooden characters I have ever been in the presence of in any piece of narrative fiction. Ever.
---
I also play anthem so I must be a glutton for punishment.
---
But he was also about choosing your own path too
---
The hell. 
---
Walking into this is the most awkward shit, like... yeah ummm I'm just picking up some stuff
---
Alright, I've been out of the loop since Forsaken dropped, can someone fill me in on this allegiance stuff?  I understand there's a quest, and you get to pick drifter/vanguard, but what does that choice actually do?  Can you switch sides later?    
---
I‚Äôve been running a thin line and last word during this so far. Double hand cannons for the win
---
Yeah whatever gets you those kills. It's not like you lose progress. 
---
*Spoiler* The drifter actually does mention that he mourns for those who die because of him, his side of the story deserves to be heard, too!
---
I was drifter yeah 
---
The whole thing is basically the praxic order can drifter. Zavala is even partially supportive of the whole "find guardians that can wield both light and dark" thing, as shown in one of the new lorebooks.
---
150 sucks on consoles anyways. What were you expecting?
---
That rooms been there since black armory dropped chief. Personally I use it as a clan meeting room
---
Hum how do we get that package? I finished the quest on the Vanguard side and there was nothing
---
Under ordinary circumstances this wouldn‚Äôt be a good week to look for the Ikelos weapons you‚Äôre missing, but I just got my missing two. 
---
The influx of people running EP for Thorn combined with the fact that it‚Äôs an easy wave 7 boss (the one who rains orbs everywhere) really helped push me through the 10-12 runs I needed for the SMG and Sniper. 
---
Happy hunting! 
---
Can confirm. Am running thin line lol 
---
It takes 5 void kills in quickplay for 1% lmao
---
REEEEEEE
---
Thorn is back?
---
Yeah thats like 90% god roll
---
Got it in 2 hours
---
It takes like 2 in competitive
---
Yes, Bungie is fixing soon
---
Im assuming 1 void hc kill is 1% in comp?
---
At least you don't lose progress when you die.
---
Well I got apothesys veil
---
They shouldn't have made it give more points in comp, especially for something this big of a deal
---
That's a good point.
---
... There are only 2 exotic swords

Sunshot Shell Gun:

I chose tonside with the drifter. After listening to the 7 tapes, he makes a convincing argument.
---
Well we look like bad guys.
---
Incompetent bad guys!

Ah, ghaul has a sun destroyer? ***I'LL SIMPLY KILL A WHOLE VILLAGE TO DRAW HIM OUT***

No, the only way is to create a new one unfortunately

weak in PVE??? lmfao

Found aunors reddit account /s

Currently on void handcannons, im afraid of what's next
---
such bullshit. it‚Äòs two years in the game now and we still don‚Äòt have an option for that. wtf
---
It's Arbalest. I think it's going to be limited time quest like Thunderlord and then it will become a random drop
---
The cake is a lie. 
---
*Ghost resurrects*

You sure this one is okay? Where did you get him?

From that morgue over there, his name is Abby Normal

---
I know how you felt, I had to recreate my Titan to make less T H I C C lol
---
If you own the annual pass, after you complete the Gambit Prime introductory quest you can talk to the drifter to choose to side either with him or the vanguard. This is on a per-character basis, so if you have two characters you can experience both versions of the quest. 
---
They're also capped at 3, like the other tablet chargers. The fact that you literally cannot carry the amount to purchase the tablet is consistent with the rest of Spider's stock (obviously except for the Jerky.)
---
Okay cool
---
Beans thanks buddy
---
yeah, sucks. character creator got perfect lightning but ingame lightning just messes my char up
---
Same 
---
I have the FWC version of this as my vertical monitors wallpaper
---
It took 2+ hours for the void kills. But it‚Äôs amazing in PvP, if you have that poison buff from picking up one of those balls, it can 2 tap again.
---
This post is me after playing crucible for 4 hours
---
Just do what I'm doing, go to comp. (Help me, I'm suffering)
---
Shall*
---
Yeah so I heard. I‚Äôm not going back into pvp to use it though. Not for a while... Is what I would say if I did the drifter crucible kills at the same time. ugh.

QUEST SPOILER. (I don‚Äôt know how to do spoiler tags)‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî                                                        That‚Äôs the hard part imo, you do a pretty challenging strike then you‚Äôre done. You‚Äôre going to want a full fireteam for the strike.
---
The quests are bugged at the minute for mote collection on both  
---
Uhm... it can 3 tap without the perk with 2 crits and 1 body. And with the perk it can 2 tap....
---
Sure is.
---
Eh can‚Äôt people just use kindled orchid? Kill clip rampage.
---
Probably the arbalest.
---
Variks be like:
---
Dick move. Never abandon. Lost forever.
---
It is bugged but that will be resolved very quickly.
---
Choosing the drifter poor show guardian cause would be disappointed
---
I think that Handcannon duels are really fun and I'm excited to see a comp that isn't so shotgun heavy
---
Bangin roll there bud
---
Just a forsaken version
---
F for trapped ghost.
---
Lol how did this bot end up here
---
Is it part of the curse breaker triumph
---
ugh
---
Can i do this without forsaken and the ap ? I only have the two dlc pack thingys
---
Eleventhed 
---
Thanks guys.  Got them in Prime anyways it‚Äôs faster lol.  
---
Just wait until you read the every rose has a thorn lore book.
---
Yeah their site sucks.  The UI put a real Thorn in my side.
---
.
---
I am gonna leave now
---
Why can't I grab anything from the ashes??
---
And you know... Zavala bitch boied out when Cayde was murdered by an opposing faction.
---
That alone is what made me choose the drifter.
---
Wardcliff Coil gives me trypophobia
---
That's what Redjacks are. And they suck at their job.
---
Especially when you realize that the Praxic Order doesnt seem to care about collateral damage.
---
I found it using the lore after I finish Allegiance quest
---
Are you implying that choosing the Vanguard in honor of Cayde's death not "entertaining"? Because I'm sure as hell so entertained by Cayde and his story that I want to choose his side
---
I choose drifter for my hunter and I will choose vangaurd for my warlock. I want to see what happens in both story sides.
---
Yeah, I was about to choose Vanguard last night then decided to sleep on it. Waiting for Byf to make a couple more videos before I decide. 
---
You‚Äôd think wouldn‚Äôt you. I got around 15 kills for 9% (but I guess some of those were super kills) 
---
He's died of starvation several times because he wouldn't let his ghost help him. Apparently in the dark ages resources were extremely scarce, so I believe he just got used to eating anything he could, that usually being his dead enemies.
---
I'm too poor to make one in real life so I'll just use the Flip the Coin emote. Blue is vanguard and Yellow is drifter
---
Then ikleos one you‚Äôre given by ana bray is okay 
---
You can only imagine the thousands that get spent on gacha mobile games on release date and yet those same gachas die in less than 6 months.
---
I‚Äôve been using Polaris lance against mg. Also does decent damage is damage phase 1 when I‚Äôm trying to conserve other ammo types.
---
My usual load outs are:
---
Parcel of Stardust
---
Polaris Lance/Kindled Orchid/nation of beasts
---
Hammerhead
---
(Depends on what enemy shields are, should note I‚Äôm using curated rolls for the hand cannons)
---
Midnight Coup
---
IKELOS SG
---
wardcliff coil
---
(Essentially the standard duo since warming plus whatever the season‚Äôs buff/nerf decides the power weapon)
---
Prometheus Lens
---
(Using hammerhead to regen special ammo with special finder perk on armor)
---
I will use Code of the commander with ursa exotic arms on titan, as noted by another comment, suppressor grenades are lifesavers. Bottom tree gunslinger for hunter, I‚Äôll use no exotic for mote collection phase and then put on nighthawk during boss phase. These are just what a semi-casual player like me will use. Hope somebody finds them useful, and sorry for the mobile text gore.
---
Fk you
---
Honestly just make it Mayhem and let the Nova party commence
---
I mean the black market really got me in places.  Made me feel bad for the bits...
---
If you can combine that perk with the one that lets you throw your gun when you run out of ammo? Gold. 
---
I‚Äôll never forget this dropping from the very first mob to die in a Corrupted nightfall I was running with clannies, and one of them immediately said:
---
‚Äúgrats, now go be cancer in gambit‚Äù
---
Cayde was an idiot and we all knew that, he took too many risks and he got himself killed, i found him funny but that was all about him. 
---
*Dumbass2008 lost 14 motes*
---
they don't work the same in pvp, kill clip is 30% and rampage is 10&gt;20&gt;30%
---
According to the Praxic Order, he hasnt killed any guardians directly and Gambit hasnt gotten more guardians killed than the Crucible.
---
Besides, the thing that i am reffering to is a member of the Praxic Order almost leveling a city block. Because some Shadows of Yor took a hostage, after the Praxic Order had ambushed them. Drifter states, that he would have attempted to talk them down first.
---
I miss him almost as much as Cayde. It hurts.
---
Yes switch because the PC have a better Fps in D2 at least the ps4 and PC is regularly a better choice..... Go and switch
---
Something‚Äôs fishy can‚Äôt say what
---
Thirteenthed
---
Alright alright alright
---
I need to see zavala and shaxx in some action because at the moment they feel like some old bosses. I still think the zavala origin story is the best destiny trailer. I always get the shivers from it
---
I had a match where a blueberry tossed his nova at the primevil and emptied a full auto rifle clip into it.
---
The shield was still up.
---
Tells you the same thing if you side against him and, uh, 'investigate' the tapes
---
1820, top 2%
---
Since when? Where did they say this? I thought I read everything bungie and bungie devs wrote and have never heard about this 
---
CBS shows their concern for blueberries. 
---
It‚Äôs an annual pass only exotic..
---
https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/xdarkanglex/video/71083704 
---
 30sec Clip from that game
---
I played with 3 friends yesterday, me and one of them finished the warlock kills while the other 2 still needed 2 or 3 kills. They wanted to play comp instead and we got into a round with 3 titans and the hunter. I was laughing my ass of since I finished the titan step in that mach and they were pissed the whole time
---
but it ain't out yet right?
---
What red markers?
---
Signed, the blueberry on your team
---
The Vanguard didnt protect humanity for hundreds of years against time travlelling infinite robot armies, a war race of huge hulking walking tanks, a plague of evil, literally necromantic monsters led by dark gods, and some dudes with arc guns and sometimes extra arms, by being dumb. These systems are in place for a reason, and it's worked so far. Besides, the praxis order bow to the vanguard anyway.
---
Noice 
---
Not a Shadow anymore.
---
Good idea
---
Yeah I did. It took 3 supers. Each one nearly took out an entire health bar. Between that and like 2-3 shots from my fusion rifle it was over. The hardest part was staying alive long enough to get my third super. The thralls are no joke. I was running my Go Figure/ Cold Heart/ and the fast firing void linear fusion rifle. I don't remember it's name. But if you're running with other players load out shouldn't be a huge issue. The Cold Heart was just my saving grace from the thrall and all the nights with their ark shields.

I was 100% ready to blame Todd Howard

gun
---
Probably depends on the event. If it's the Glimmer extraction or cryo pod, I can understand it. Why waste time just standing there, shooting enemies? 
---
It's not a "drop" its a reward for the bounty. You literally need to collect it in your inventory.
---
The only reason I would see why the bounty giving 300 gear is if you never purchased forsaken, since the cap is 300 Power &amp; level 20... but then you wouldn't be able to speak to the drifter, so idk.
---
m√∂tes
---
$69.99 is what I paid for Forsaken + Annual Pass during the recent sale.
---
 $69.99 for D2 + the rest sounds like a good deal
---
I'm waiting until more content is released before taking a side.
---
I choose Drifter for the same reason.
---
Gun
---
Because you can't hold exotics, and it's only a replica
---
Better dust off your second character 
---
Same with me as of now, but I can't help but feel like there are high level players out there that have to do the quest painfully slowly just so they can not break their comp rank.
---
 aa
---
Drifter all the way. Amazing story throughout the quest 
---
I'm not entirely sure about next week, but it is coming twice this season, so next Tuesday wouldn't be a far off guess.
---
That would make my whole damn year. Favorite D1 gun by far
---
There were an astonishing number of IKELOS_HC's out there last night. Idk how you people use that gun honestly.
---
Don't know if that's the right pic for the drifter.  From what I learned in the vanguard questline the drifter is super pathetic.  I'm thinking more Jamie Kennedy from that Malibu gangster movie. 
---
I already played him in rumble a month ago and asked for the clip he told me he made, but he didn't send me an clip of me "lagging" 
---
I have not yet played the new gambit, but its post like this...... 
---
I like to have fun and enjoy the game.. of course everyone likes to win... but... isn't the game suppose to be fun?
---
I mean... they all ask for things you either can‚Äôt get or hold enough of. Other than the one thing you are supposed to buy. 
---

---
Doesn't sound like it, I just wanted to pull up the bundle.
---
For me on Xbox, there's red markers above the envoys when they spawn in, also on the HUD. 
---
Another tip, if you see someone bank motes and you have enough for a small blocker go bank, 2 of them at the same time drains the other teams motes, also the small blockers (goblins) sheild/give other blockers immunity. So try to get a small one over with a medium or a large, to stop them taking it out quite as fast. 
---
I'd love war zone public event, light guardian vs dark guardian. World War vibe.
---
Except Zavala and Ikora are ok with the drifter and think he will be useful. They even allowed him to move out of the sunglasses hut and into a bed bath and beyond. 
---
That toxic praxic warlock is the one who is against old drifty. That's who you are really siding with. 
---
Not even it is a fake ghorn
---
Wait what!? You can drain motes from the bank when you invade ? 
---
Well that ain‚Äôt true the house of light is with guardians
---
Makes sense
---
if it's an ongoing dispute you just want to hit that option that says "block" and move on with your life
---
thank you, very cool
---
No you don‚Äôt. You are 899,999 short. 
---
My entire Clan is rushing to get Thorn as fast as possible, meanwhile I am just sitting in the back completing everything else and realizing that request will be a lot easier when everyone else is not rushing to complete it.
---
Yep, range masterworked mine, even without dropmag. It's just too spicy and Hunter dodge saves me in tight reload situations. Rampage/Kill Clip Orchids are monsters.
---
Stick to with the vanguard. That warlock sounds a bit obsessive but that's only because the drifter is shady as hell messing with taken! It's a totally fair op to make sure he's not doing incredibly shady stuff that'll work against the city.
---
Plus, you wouldn't wanna be a rogue, would yah?
---
loot. Where do i sign up?
---
[deleted]
---
Also, under the more bar, there will be another bar come up, it's a damage stack bar. Don't use heavy/super if you can til it's a decent way down. 
---
That's whats being talked about if someone says don't use that until the 2-3rd stack. 
---
I wish I could have that rng 
---
Lol you know what would piss the drifter off turning up in gambit prime with full vanguard gear.
---
1299.45 top 5% for D2 here.
---
question: what is a blueberry?
---
Pretty sure there isn‚Äôt $10 worth of content in there. 
---
Why isn‚Äôt it true?  Cayde changed his opinion on the vanguard.  In his final moments he was proud to be a part of it.  His legacy will always be as the hunter vanguard.  
---
The vanguard always has been and always will be the true protector of the people.  The drifter might have some good to him, but the vanguard have been by my side and shaped me from the day I awoke next to that broke ass car.  
---
No chance am I changing allegiance because someone with some shiny tokens showed up.  
---
The idea that people are bailing on the vanguard because Zavala wouldn‚Äôt let them seek vengeance at the risk of losing it all seems very short sighted to me.  
---
Especially when I‚Äôm certain Zavala knew we would and could do it alone so why risk the lives of less talented guardians to avenge the life of one?
---
I'm curious if you could purchase the lion if you used the full inventory make override frequency trick to get enough of the same?
---
Same except my Warlock is with Drifter and my Titan is with the Vanguard
---
Lmao
---
Yea but the drifters cool therefore (with cayde gone) makes him the better choice 
---
It does lots of damage. The end.
---
my hunter slave is going vanguard. my lock is going rogue. my titan is going to trash bin.
---
PC
---
memory fragment part of Warmind secret, collect all and get exotic reward.
---
3 nightfalls plus one Ashir bounty, bingo bango done. 
---
She is probably better than me 
---
So do I, but playing all competitive still took me a good 3 hours to do 
---
Cayde was one of the few well written characters in this game, your going to get downvoted just because of that, but not from me, because I don't even play this game anymore, I just appreciate the memes.
---
Colonel and his buddies, typical Cayde's pet.
---
You go girl! Get those motes 
---
.. so you got handed one of the best exotic hand cannons in the game, from doing a quest that took you one day... and you're complaining.
---
And this is why Devs shouldn't take player complaints too seriously.
---
That's a perfectly fine reason :)
---
I'm not complaining about my own road because I'm around 300-500 SR. I'm just saying that it must be hell trying to keep your rank up higher.
---
Tell that idiot to bank her fucking motes.
---
You have a good reasoning without senseless "DOING IT FOR CAYDE" argument. That's nice.
---
Once you get the tier 3 invader set.
---
Nope, it's been known for a long time. Thanks for reminding me though, almost forgot this week!
---
Sounds solid. I only got 12500 kills with mine got it in day 1 of forsaken with firmly planted and range finder. Got a reload masterwork which is ok and i use ikarus mod since i switched to warlock and its just nasty floating in the air and still easy kill with one shot.
---
And that's why I hated him.
---
Then I cAnnot help you! I can offer some vague cheerleading at best 
---
Scared the shit out of me first time I saw it, and the head was like "hey"
---
I care about the people up there because I've been there in other games before, and having teammates who terribly in your games because they want to get something done is really annoying, and all bungie is doing is providing a catalyst.
---
If cayde-6 didn't die I think I would have chosen the vanguard 110%.
---
Looks just like the one machinegun we got for christmas was it? idk but i definetly seen this given to me for free i think ...
---
Not counting newly added exotic, my warlock (on which I make all milestones and play a lot in general) had 22/23 exotics since the beginning of January.  
---
No Geomags for me, the only exotic I want among them all.  
---
Don't be fine with it. It hurts. It hurts a lot.  
---
Utilize your all chances. 
---
1 v 4 are the only odds fair against me.
---
Gotta love bugs, at least some of them
---
That's exactly what I was hoping TLW would do to the meta
---
That first item is the new exotic Hunter gauntlets so I'm happy with that 
---
I think they are referring to the mandatory crucible step (void/HC kills) that gives better completion rate for playing comp as opposed to other crucible modes.
---
I‚Äôd do any quest for that gun 
---
I haven't been able to stop looking at or laughing at this for ten minutes, thank you.

Is your best bet top find a clan, and please be descriptive about what you're looking for
---
-EX. Looking for- Raids, Game modes, Time zone. Things like that you want to include to find you the best group. 
---
"You gotta keep both eyes open" -Nick Fury
---
what is the difference there? morally? I just want to be sure about my first choice.
---
I read "Gun" in Dunkey's voice.
---
Don't take that into crucible, won't be hard to get headshot by ANY sniper!
---
Veist Poison Shimmer maybe? I have an entire Dragonfly Regalia set with it and it's my favorite looking armor. 
---
IKR.. People wanted the objectives to be more clear. Idk how they could've made it more clear than what they did. Even in normal Gambit the Drifter tells you to burn the Envoys first
---
Ikora exists
---
Id kill to get my crota armor back
---
Subjectively? Yes. Objectively? Nope.
---
It goes away, and from what I hear you can't get it back at this time.
---
Chaotic good? Chaotic neutral?
---
Fair, I am always Hunter main but the game only gets harder if you limit your choices. Even if you just work other classes a little bit it will make your life easier
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm gonna do
---
My warlock main goes Vanguard, my recently re-discovered hunter can go play with the Drifter if time permits. 
---
Kinda funny how there is still no hunter vanguard üëÄ
---
This is my style 
---
the 115% is against bosses, against regular adds the bonus is a lot higher iirc. this is the new heavy weapon to run on heavyweight nightfalls after the nerfs to sleeper and whisper ammo capacity. warlocks with well and lunafactions can 1 phase nokris solo if i'm not mistaken.
---
I can't wait to see the stats on how many people chose each side
---
I haven't heard about this specific bug, but if it was me, I'd just do it on the character you picked it up on first and not risk not being able to get it back. I have read people are having issues with not being able to get the Allegiance quest back after abandoning it, dunno if the Thorn quest has the same problem or not.
---
Curiosity
---
&gt;!Kind of... He didn't do anything wrong. The conclusion is essentially, "He's just a scared homeless man haunted by his past, doing what he has to do to survive". The Vanguard and Praxic Order decide to keep letting him do what he's doing in order to try and bring back Orin, the current emissary of the Nine. !&lt;
---
Thanks
---
Also yeah you right with the one phase. 
---
Gotcha
---
Oh ok i gotcha
---
Winter has come. Bring a sword.

By chosing Aunor, you side with a crazy guardian killer that already killed a bunch of drifters's guys. When drifter was a buddy and gave you sweet loot. You're the traitor here.
---
True that
---
warmind needed content, best way to pad whatever was available was to make the grind really really painful and force you to run all over the place looking. 
---
Could easily be referencing a Mod on your armor or something. Hard to say without any context. 
---
Bungie is probably waiting for destiny 3 üòÇ. Bungie doesn‚Äôt like hunters
---
Void kills are + 1 void hand cannon kills are + 2. I believe it‚Äôs like 250- 300 void hand cannon kills in regular crucible. It‚Äôs only 100 in comp
---
We killed him in the strange terrain strike, although being a necromancer he could end up being alive in the end
---
Not quite. A lot of distortion and whatnot with the Servitor and I've been hearing "DISMANTLE MINES, YES?" in my head for longer than D2 has existed
---
Go to Sherpa for raids
---
Dead drop? Is that a quest mission?
---
Prospector is better
---
Seriously had no idea that existed. Thanks and sorry for the inconvenience.
---
If only that was possible
---
Your point?
---
I'm choosing vanguard.
---
Well we do love our horror
---
Quest just dropped Tuesday
---
TBH, I did this my first time.
---
Wut
---
why i cant see or understand anything?
---
?
---
Since the Drifter is obviously a cowardly, piece of shit d-bag, dudebro poser, and non-guardian wimp, I couldn't give less of a shit what his opinion is on any topic. I was slaying hive Gods while he was off playing pattycake at the edge of the system because he's too much of a chickenshit to do a real guardian's work.
---
Hey is that reskinned armor for the Spring event?
---
For fuckin' real??
---
We (a team of four) got absolutely destroyed in the mote collecting phase by a team of three with a blueberry. We had zero motes banked when they summoned the primeval. With some good invading and a lot of luck (heavy ammo drops) we got our first From The Jaws Of Defeat medal.
---
They totally deserved the win, so much respect to them. None the less, I'm happy with how that worked out.
---
Do you mean 21% delirium? If so what part about this would count towards anything
---
I am talking about the exotics we just got
---
There is a "Allegiance Tracker" on the "Destinythegame" reddit page, just have a look there.
---
Yeah, delirium. Orbs, precision kills?
---
#thats the oxygen
---
what the freak does it matter??
---
#so thats how you type like that
---
Nsfw just due to language.
---
I‚Äôve read the data mined stuff but not everyone has so you should spoiler mark this kinda stuff in the future
---
So the ornament will be rose?
---
Thorn quest has nothing to do with that data mined lore
---
Go grind not forgotten then if you want a challenge.
---
More like a Russian trying to speak Japanese IMO
---
Chore-like grinds are not fun or interesting
---
If you haven't noticed, the entire game is designed around being easy for casuals. There is no real progression system, none of the content is difficult, you can do the entire game in blue items and most of it solo. They don't even bother to make PvP challenging for people that want to treat crucible as an end game activity.
---
Inverted spire strike I believe,  when ghost says the drills are guarded by a full battalion.
---
THIS IS MADNESS!
---
Already done

Dupe? You fucker, I don't even have the rng to get dupes lol

IT TOOK LESS THAN A DAY THATS NOT LONG

I got my Whisper post-Forsaken. When I heard "You Shall Drift", I had one thought.

#Alright Alright Alright

What big news?
---
Literally how I felt but I got survival, which is just as terrible
---
Oh I didn't see it was a comment on a comment, I thought he was refering to OP
---
Yesterday was the the first time I've used it in the crucible, my freind and I both activated it at the same time charging into the enemy team. It was great.
---
And Shaxx is a monster on the field of battle, and the bedroom if Mara is to be believed. Shaxx only fears 2 things, The Darkness itself, and Ikora when she's mad.
---
Spoiling that Thorn exists?
---
THANK YOU For sharing :p
---
cant wait till I get to the void step so I can die and never want to return to pvp ever again
---
ya
---
So you don't get to finish the warlock triumphs...I see.
---
If you have a team right now it could be even easier potentially lol.
---
FINGERTIPS ~~ON~~ FROM THE SURFACE
---
the drifter sends you here if you side with him
---
I have a feeling theyll be doing exactly the same things just with a different flavor text.
---
Your an idiot I'm talking about shin being a dredgen
---
Bungie split from Activision would be my guess
---
Ah yes thank you
---
*laughs in Eliksni*
---
Either way you gotta be a tough motherfucker to survive as long as Drifter with so many people trying to kill ya. He‚Äôs been around for awhile
---
does it count towards it though? i wonder
---
you have much to learn titan-san
---
So with forever it's still the same essentially?  2 head 1 body. 
---
Halo is coming to Steam if I‚Äôm not mistaken
---
No it‚Äôs vestian guard not Jesus Christ
---
One Eyed Mask with a Back Up Plan Erentil FR4.
---
Have to finish his intro quests for the new dlc. After you complete the reckoning part he should have the dialogue 
---
Vanguard is outdated and doesn't serve any real purpose any more. Ikora and Zavara are both lazy and sit around the tower twiddling their thumbs 24/7. They took advantage of other Guardians and forced them to die over and over so they could sit in the tower eating Donut Holes and Gjallardoodles
---
The only thing left that really that matters is collecting motes.
---
Makes his job way easier, no need to shoot the ghost after you vaporize the poor sod.
---
Fall for what?  This app is legit.
---
i dont think its possible to get it
---
Mai roflcopter goes SOI SOI SOI SOI SOI SOI
---
It's a 2 head 1 body without soul devourer. And a 2 head with.
---
Literally been known for so fucking long lmao, if you care so much why haven't you cared to read up on it?
---
Cayde also had the idea for Gambit anyway.
---
what are you talking about? that is the traveler mask from last year
---
You don't.  It's PS exclusive.
---
Yeah üòÖ
---
They can be strong under the right circumstances but ultimately they are outdone  by any comparable weapon type
---
Its not proven he made it specifically for Cayde, its more likely he sold it on spiders black market and the rifleman got a hold of it, at least in my opinion. Unless it does say that, if so could you post a link? I like reading lore
---
There is literally no reason to think this, at all.  We don't know the root of the partnership, and it's entirely possible that part of the agreement to hand Bungie control of Destiny in it's entirety included a legal responsibility to finish out the contract with Sony.
---
The teleportation is very inconsistent though
---
You can try, I‚Äôm not going to stop you, brotha
---
Well that all depends on if you own all of the current dlc or not.
---
The issue though is that swords don't do anything incredibly well. Strikers sure hand can do more damage without ammo than with 
---
Don't play comp, go into quickplay and Lane with a good void handcanon while using void abilities and heavy.
---
I never get tired of EP. I already have all the EP loot, but whenever I see blueberrys on an EP when I drop into Mars I always join in the mayhem. It‚Äôs just fun.
---
Shin Malphur is Dredgen Vale?  So not really?
---
Well, about that..
---
no because the crucible part made me delete the quest.
---
Its decent. But not great. For pve you want rampage and  feeding frenzy or something in combination with those. In pvp you want tap the trigger and dynamic sway reduction. Regardless, it's a killer gun baseline. 
---
Am I the only one who thinks Comp is a joke? Never played it before until Thorn quest and three out of five games, my team spawns in with less than the max player count. The other two times were when the other team didn't have max players. Why is this acceptable? 
---
Judging by the amount of 666 items posted on this subreddit this week, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs slower gains than usual
---
Lost connections
---
Certain supers when paired with certain exotics make this possible. For instance, I run a tether hunter with orpheus rigs. Am I gonna kill the primevil? No. But I'll have a super ready at every phase. I like making the enemy panic when they see a big chunk come off the primevil on the first phase. They know they've already lost.
---
Ok
---
is it really? no wonder I was getting absolutely demolished in crucible
---
Wooow cant u just get it again? I can help
---
Hmmm seems a bunch of people on here and getting it dropped at 666.
---
Ah darn thanks anyway 
---
Equipping Coil and pressing F is very high skill maneuver
---
So you turn your back on everything else over a few weapons.
---
Do what
---
English voice drifter annoys me a lot look likes a edgy teenager. In portuguese brazilian his voice is  an evil adult. It fits more imo. Nice trick with void arrow .
---
Only using it for the masterwork but I was more excited about the timing of everything. They had that primeval down to a sliver.
---
Next week
---
Is there bad boss at the end?!
---
That sweet grenade launcher... 
---
Those kwazy wabbits 
---
Yeah it makes sense since everyone is around 660  power while doing it
---
What?
---
I did count Breakneck, I didn't count Oxygen SR3 because it's overall pretty meh
---
thank you for reminding me about Redix though!
---
I have fixed it to include the pulse rifle 
---
I was worried about that, it's part of why I wasn't sure about going against him. Like, he's got a link to the Nine, and there was a point in history when they were really cool (because they gave Xur good shit to give to me). He can't be all bad!
---
So... betraying the Vanguard because of Cayde-6, who's last words were that the Vanguard was the best dare he ever lost, as well as saying the Vanguard would always have your back?  
---
Man, he'd be disappointed in you.
---
I think they are telling me to use Hand Cannons more.
---
Maybe...
---
nightmare fuel !!
---
You can just floor is lava super jump up there.
---
They aren‚Äôt wrong. It‚Äôs the math that was done lol. You can speed up the progress by getting headshot streaks. 
---
Doesn‚Äôt sound like a group I would want to run with. They sound pretty uptight; getting all offended to a member joining a different fire team? Nahh.. not the kind of people I like.
---
Maybe just me but, I‚Äôd like a new exotic/good side arm please. All we got is Rat King. That‚Äôs it.
---
It doesn't matter if you think it's "meh", it's an endgame pinnacle weapon and you stated you would include those weapons
---
You would hope, but there are a surprising number of perks that just aren't very good, such as disruption break or headseeker. 
---
As an Orpheus Rigs Hunter. Your welcome for the orbs
---
In their defense it was just the clan leader if it were anyone else I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd care (I don‚Äôt think most players would care) but for some reason I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that this was personal
---
I have that exact same controller 
---
Hey, don't be like that. Some people want to experience the game as it was meant to be and you should respect that. This isn't raidsecrets or DestinyLore-most here don't know the twist. Besides, that news isn't even a month old, of course not everyone is going to know yet.
---
 
---
Yeah its sad but it needs a range buff at the very least. The soul devourer makes it strong yes, but you have to be close enough to get the soul and even then it requires an enemy to be near within 6 seconds. I will use the gun because its Thorn but if I play comp TLW or Ace comes out lol. 
---
I like bunnies too.
---
I hate to get killed by a Luna‚Äôs howl it just makes me want bungie to make competitive specific weapons
---
Oh sorry haha
---
Indeed. I can't wait to cough up $60 for a four year old collection of games from almost 20 years ago.
---
If you need a clan check ours out:
---
Frozen Blue Thralls on PS4. I am the clan leader and happy to send an invite. Hit me up on PS4 with a message and your psn if you want in. We communicate with bungie app and psn messenger but there‚Äôs no requirement to have to do anything or even be active in message. Just send a shout if you want to run something. We have about 95 in clan but a lot of folks aren‚Äôt as active with so many new games dropping. That being said we usually hit all of our clan engrams on a weekly basis. My psn is Lee1848 hit me up and we can connect. Have a few spots for any friends you have as well.
---
The whole mode is just dogshit in general.
---
who?
---
Do downvotes even mean anything? I always see people complaining about downvotes and wonder why.
---
I'm sure all the scrubby hunters will do the downvote thing, and no doubt this unpopular opinion will trigger them too.
---
Cayde chose himself over his family, doesn't matter what he went through after the fact or he tried to make it right,even at the most important decision in his life, he chose himself over his family and there is no forgiving that. Ever.
---
His death came much later than it should have. (Don't think the way it happened was right, but the result is what he deserved).
---
Your title is blaming bunnies for their lack of communication
---
Those fuckers are up to something 
---
Any tips on completing the strike?
---
Its little more hard doing the cayde quest ( i havent played the game in months ), and i have another quest with 20 kills on a shotgun ( i suck at shotguns ), and i need to keep getting kills and not die. Its already a bit of a stress for me lol
---
Feels bad
---
Credit too @DestinyTheGame, with my edit.
---
Ah nice! At least it wont be a boring wait to play the games!
---
Mmm yeah take that üò§
---
so to answer your questions!
---
1. there is only one exotic sidearm, it came out in year one, Rat King.
---
2. there are actually THREE LFRs but only one isn't a heavy.
---
This is like the Destiny equivalent of finding a secret room in the OG Doom. Geez. I wonder how long this has been there.
---
Yeh man, 110% Grab a full fireteam. I used Phoenix Protocol with Rift Warlock, on the DPS Phase where the final boss teleports, put down the rift, or any sort of support Super and get ready to kill the knights that spawn on the left and right, make sure you kill them before the boss. 
---
Also be very wary of the Thrall as they kill you quickly with Blackout.
---
if they are to bring it back it should be energy so as to keep LunaLuna from being a thing.
---
\&gt;me literally everytime an exotic pvp weapon is released
---
Oh ffs I forgot the new one they just added, what‚Äôs the third? Crooked fang, this new one, and?
---
a super close range, instant pull out 2-tap shotgun pistol?
---
#noice
---
Except the pvp one that‚Äôs ones hell
---
I still have not done this. Thanks for the reminder. 
---
i agree
---
they have Sleeper Simulant aka Spartan Laser, Queenbreaker, the og meta invader's/anti-invader's Swiss Army Knife, ansmd the new Arbalest which no one has yet.
---
Ye man, I'm telling you OP is onto something!
---
Someone made the dark joke?
---
It would pair nice with trick sleeves. And if they aren‚Äôt in that range, wouldn‚Äôt do much. I don‚Äôt know man. I‚Äôll take any new exotic side arm at this point. 
---
Quick play isn‚Äôt that bad tbh, even my low-level of competitive isn‚Äôt as gnarly or sweaty as gambit prime 
---
You‚Äôre not wrong 
---
I agree, and I when one day I have the time to stack up with some LFG randos, I‚Äôm sure it will be much more fun. Even more so when I eventually have a full armor set 
---
It even has 666 power
---
Slow clap üëè üëè well done

I don't know if they have it on the Drifter side of the quest, but when I finished the Vanguard side of the quest, there was a lore item that detailed a story of two dudes who died on a cliff above the Salt Mines. I had heard it would be on the EDZ, so I assumed that was where the quest would start. I found the hidden area, and fumbled around until I got the prompt to hold the square button.
---
It was about the car crash
---
‚ÄúWhen I kick there‚Äôs no returns‚Äù alright, officer badass 
---
True facts 
---
Glad I grinded out the vanguard strikes in the weekend.! That thing is a monster!! 
---
Honestly tho like it stops them from killing envoys and ads as fast was they would so it still good m8!
---
that's fine, but that doesn't stop them from making more if the others at the same time.
---
Oh sorry. Was just trying to help
---
oooooof
---
Are dark jokes allowed on this sub? 
---
If not dont read what ima say right after:
---
Id choose the dead girl drifter held in his hamds
---
FOR CAYDE
---
This^ 
---
Spawn times are not that long. And damage phase is not that long either.
---
Invade to slow them a couple seconds from clearing the envoys
---
Or 
---
Invade to disrupt their damage phase and force them to do another cycle of envoys and ads
---
They do a bit
---
cue the screaming cowboy [AAHHHHHHHHHHH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBLdQ1a4-JI)
---
Damn right! And she's a Golden Gun toting Gunslinger!
---
Hey. I am not near the end game content for this dlc. Is it the last quest step for thorn? Is it really that hard?
---
It's depressing
---
That misfit is decent. I wouldn't even look at that better devils though. I would be looking for acc rounds, outlaw and killclip, or acc rounds, opening shot and snapshot.
---
People are taking this Allegiance quest waaaay too seriously and it's cracking me up.
---
It's a friggin' game people. Chill out. 
---
agreed, this guy clearly hasn't read the patches :/
---
i didn't even play d1 but reading about this gun makes me want it soooo bad! a gun with several different customization traits for each part of the gun has been something I wanted since I started playing, so I'd never need the same gun, just different perks.
---
My guess is Rose/First Curse. 
---
Dredgen Yor was a guardian who became corrupted by darkness. He massacred people in a town called Palamon, and was eventually put down by Shin Malphur.
---
Later on, guardians would become obsessed with him and form a group called the Shadows of Yor. They take Dredgen as a title and create weapons of darkness to mimic Yor's gun Thorn. Shin Malphur hunts down the Shadows to stop them (there's some new lore that complicates things but I won't spoil that)
---
The Drifter is/was one of those people, and you can actually get a title called Dredgen by playing Gambit.
---
That just comes down to man power and time, they had a pretty quick schedule to meet to keep content coming every couple months, even if people argue it‚Äôs very little content. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they‚Äôd heard this feedback and are already working exotics of other types in. Personally, with the toland references in the dreaming city, I fully expect a return of bad juju
---
I really love people debating. I can see quality memes, other people's opinion on the drifter/vanguard
---
What I dont like on the other hand is"Thats what Cayde would of wanted" when they choose either. Like gtfo here is this Cayde's account?
---
I would love to have a dad like that, or a dad, in general
---
Yes same here
---
or at least have a dad
---
For now you get more lore for siding with the vanguard, and drifter talks shit to you. I'm just nervous about missing out on something big down the road going one side or the other. 
---
Ya know what would make Oxygen SR3 a little better? Triple tap. 
---
would be dope if they turned it into a high rof void scout
---
Thats interesting! Thank you! One more question? If I chose vanguard can I still start the quest?
---
YES!
---
This but unironically.
---
If you're doing that then maybe a slight reduction in stability and handling-
---
yes sir, I'm a hunter running hammers of sol now. you've changed my titan ways. &lt;3
---
I hate them because people can do shit like this all the time xDD
---
Hahahahahahahahahahaha
---
Why need a team? There's always plenty of people at the blind well. This week is guaranteed second seed from Mara. 
---
Just farm the blind well. You should get one in under 5 clears or so
---
Hopefully your friend doesn‚Äôt wrap his car around a tr-... no I can‚Äôt do it, it‚Äôs still too soon 
---
I‚Äôll kill that blue bitch if he comes for my light üôÇ
---
XD the stability is trash lol
---
Over on the banner on the right side of this sub is an infograph that shows they things you get with Annual Pass VS. Just having Forsaken. Also, the FAQ read-before-you post has more detailed info.
---
Hope that helps, and welcome to the game Guardian! 
---
Easy solution. Get two titans with ursa to run mid-tree sentinel, also get a slowva bomb warlock. The shields will melt thrall that run through them, generate orbs on blocked dmg, and give your warlock a safe place to hide behind as they launch bombs at the knights and boss. You can use Jotuun to deal with the shriekers, wizards, and smaller knights. Did this last night with clan members and took us about 30 min or so.
---
Yeah at the top if you jump on the platform when you're at the iracle offer terminal thing its on the ledge opposite  
---
I like lolercoaster
---
Yup! Idk if it makes any noise though
---
Or you could git gud.
---
I haven't played D1, but isn't your character technically the same person who won everything that happened in that game as well?
---
For a 150 it's reasonably good. As much as a 140. What I'm saying is that if you're gonna buff it that much at least make the stability less - the same as other 150s. 
---
The handling and range are the only things I'd buff if it was up to me - and only ten to the range at most.
---
Only for pass holders
---
Well, darn. Thank you nonetheless.
---
That explains why our carry yesterday couldn't communicate to save their life but could 1080 no scope with a white sidearm.
---
those are mostly the like 10-16 year olds(physically and/or mentally) and overaggressive competitive players, I used to be a bit of both but I've calmed down as of late
---
Was this concept art made by bungie, or is it fan art by someone else?
---
Riven of a thousand seeds
---
Even if they are, it‚Äôs not something bungie can necessarily tell if the majority of the people ask
---
Hooooowwwww?!
---
such is a sad fact of life, that the greedy self-centered majority is noticed far more than the minority that love the game.
---
Talk to the drifter 
---
Go talk to the drifter!
---
Talk to the Drifter. Make sure your pursuits tab is not full, and don't delete the quest! 
---
Pretty sure Ana does the exact opposite of what the Vanguard asks...just saying 
---
Defies Zavala at every turn, goes against their wishes and seeks info about her past life, only works with them because she needs our help to yeet Xol, etc.
---
:\_{
---
How ya livin‚Äô, sister?
---
yes, Doctor!
---
It‚Äôs not been obtained. And from what people are speculating it‚Äôs tied to tier 3 or the nine bounties
---
are we gonna talk about the fact that you lost 17 motes and did 0 primeval damage 
---
Report him
---
Destiny lore: *Lesbians. Lesbians everywhere.*
---
I can't think of a single gay couple.  
---
No ;) Because I had to constantly invade to keep us in the game lol. 
---
ROFLMAO
---
TF IS THIS AINT ME
---
&gt;üëå
---
I was just messin with ya
---
Fair :P Haha
---
Nah, shaxx is the physical manifestation of big dick energy
---
Snitch 
---
Devrim and Marc.
---
Which side did you choose... it impacts the lore book 
---
Yo how you do this I'm gonna be speed running nightfalls like that XD
---
Haven‚Äôt trace rifles always been in the special slot? 
---
With the recent buffs both got, they've become more popular, at least on Xbox. I see a lot of people using them for EP, Blind Well, Strikes/Nightfall, and Gambit/Prime/Reckoning.
---
Also, they fixed so that Auto Rifle armor perks affect Trace Rifles. So with Reserves, Scavenger, Targeting, Reload, and Special Ammo finder, you can have a pretty efficient loadout. 
---
That's a question with a complicated answer...  
---
For one, I think he does genuinely want to save humanity, but he's very...apathetic about it. Or at least he refuses to let things affect him. The developer who writes his dialogue confirmed that the Drifter does not love our Guardian (referencing the "You wish for love and support" wish that summons him in Last Wish), but loves what they do for him. But newer lore confirms he goes genuinely feel grief for the people who died for/because of him. Overall, I think he's a character who has a mission and refuses to let his emotions get in the way.   
---
So I think the simplest answer is "morally grey." It's worth noting that in Bungie's writing there's very little black and white. Sure, there are characters who are morally upstanding because they want to be (like Zavala or post-H2 Arbiter) and characters who don't give a shit about anyone but themselves (like Mara or the Prophet of Truth) but otherwise you'll very rarely find a character who's strictly good or evil. Bungie is very keen on putting a lot beneath the surface, *especially* when it comes to the topic of morality.   
---
I'm explaining this because a lot of people ask if characters like Calus or Drifter are "good or evil" and I think they need to understand a Bungie's writing is never that simple. 
---
If you picked drifter you can‚Äôt complete it. It said that in the list of stuff when you picked sides.
