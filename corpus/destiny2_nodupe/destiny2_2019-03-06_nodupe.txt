\* simply reuses parts of a weapon model as a ghost shell \*
---
&gt; Meh, good enough. Ship it.
---
I've tried it out without the macro by just using the scroll wheel  , its still the same speed as with a macro 
---
Same here.  All 3 characters.  Luckily I had 2 balistics logs already on my warlock so I can at least get that going.
---
I just want you to know im not just pointing at you, idk how you play but with most people, shotguns arent situational they are a lifeline all game long, comp or not. Now im not as good at sniping as some people ive saw clips of but its not just camping in the back. The whole point of practicing is knowing where they are going to peek even close-ish range and pop them in the head before they can react. If your getting shot at, quickly change position in your cover and bam. Most people cant adjust that fast. Its not a good lone wolf strategy ill admit, but if you have a decent team it works pretty well. 
---
Im just saying that ill be ok with them making shotguns less of a dominate weapon in pvp. And im going to disagree with sniper shots being rng. I mean yeah if your getting blasted in the face it probably isnt gonna land but i guess dont do that. I hope bungie realized certain things needed tweaked, we'll see.
---
Nice try.
---
This wasn't about politics until you yelled out libtard.
---
That showed me your level of class and decorum. Typical of a trumpist. Like your great leader, you have no class or decorum
---
It‚Äôs a little servitor 
---
&gt;elete new D2 folder &gt; rename old d2 folder back from d2.1 to d2 , now open battlenet and it will still show initializing , but just for the proof open task manager again and you can see battlenet is using your Disk , now wait for a good 5-10 minutes and your Download bar will pop up again and you can see the download . i just fixed it for myself . so tell me if this works .
---
This worked!! The trick was to exit the app while the new download was running. Thanks so much!
---
Kinda off topic, but is there any chance anyone here could tell me how to get one of the ornaments for Sunshot? Or is that not possible anymore?
---
Typo sorry 
---
Aah reminds me of my first game of gambit prime today i had 76 motes banked on my team. Needless to say but we lost 2 people were on 0. Solo queing sucks sometimes
---
Wondering the same. Cause I can't out them in 
---
Sepiks Prime chrome
---
I, for one, am glad they nerfed both the EP Shotty and Whisper.  They were cool don't get me wrong but whats the point of playing a game that is all about getting loot if you're going to use the same 3 guns almost all of the time.  Midnight Coupe, Ikelos SG, and Whisper is dull.  Balancing like this gives reasons to use other weapons.
---
[removed]
---
Yeah you can also read the patch notes that bungie released..? 
---
Yes 
---
Rail gun!
---
Bungie is aware of this bug and is fixing it, dont know how long it will take then tho
---
Mm, yes what?
---
Whenever I see the word Therapist, I see ‚ÄúThe Rapist.

im dont even live in america. im sorry if i offended you by saying libtard but i was just trying to meme, i dont really take things like that seriously

i think trumps an idiot, and somebody who was on a reality tv show shouldnt turn around and decide to be president
---
Uh. Nice. Glad they are on it already. Although I've just seen another thread about the weekly light well bounty too. 
---
I wish lol
---
I‚Äôll enjoy it more once I get my hands on that juicy thorn next Tuesday :)
---
I‚Äôm wondering how it works I did the daily heroic on titan as I needed it to go towards my wayfarer title. It gave a ‚Äúpowerful engram‚Äù I got a massive boost from 650 to 651 yay 
---
BEWARE!
---
This is what bungie did to me when I time traveled to the next reset so i had more chances at getting jotunn from the weekly forges. I believe it is just a punishment for breaking the economy.
---
Yes my dude everything powerful from BA is 650+
---
Nice looking graphic. Try a Scourge encounter 1 map, that'd be helpful and look good.
---
You're your own worst enemy. 
---
Both games have problems but id much rather play destiny because i like the core gameplay and gunplay much better. But youd have to try it to find out if its right for you.
---
Alright. Let's see what we got
---
Hated normal gambit even with a 4 stack
---
Love gambit prime with a 4 stack
---
As real as it gets. 
---
It reminds me a harmonica. 
---
I did the catalyst solo. Went through and got the chests each week for 10 weeks straight. Not sure if the chests are still a once a week thing though since the changes. 
---
Sunshot ghost only plays fire
---
I'll help you if you're on ps4. psn dr_khouse
---
Which aspect ma dude
---
Oh yeah and sorry for the quality. Apparently PS4 hates having its screenshots shared.
---
shit like that pisses me off
---
Made me lol, I'll give you that.
---
This is an update, not satisfied with explanation, as blocks light level progression.

From Bungie:
---
&gt;***Weekly Bounties***: We are investigating an  issue where Weekly Bounties from various vendors are not properly  resetting for some players. In the meantime, players should expect these  to reset on Sundays.(source: [https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/46168](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/46168))
---
So, I‚Äôve synthesized motes, and multiple times I haven‚Äôt received anything except glimmer. Is it still RNG after inserting motes? Is this a bug? Can someone confirm? 
---
No doubt. I have the extra logs on two toons, and could use them, but would like to replenish them and can't bc of this nonsense. Hoping they release a hot fix or something before next week to fix it.
---
How is it?
---
Can confirm this is a thing 
---
Nice edit 
---
Nice
---
Disturbingly chocolatly
---
I miss montages. People stopped appreciating them after twitch
---
#Nice
---
All year 2 armor has random intrinsic perks now according to the patch notes.
---
First exotic I'm going for
---
Assuming i have good rng
---
You must deposit motes before each reckoning round. Have you been doing that as well? 
---
Gotta use destinylfg or something like that. That way you can recruit people based on how they like to play. Plus you'll be in a party and communicate and coordinate. If you are on PS4 hit me up (Ninjaferret529). I'm put of town right now and work full time, but would be happy to slay or protect the bank while you gather or whatever when I get the time to play.
---
what content bro the few missions amd strongholds that arrived at launch arent enough to keep me playing plus destiny never had me restarting my console as much as anthem so u can dick ride on someone elses post
---
Oh, that‚Äôs awesome! 
---
This is a great offer and all, I hate solo queue, but I think he was joking about the flavor text
---
I thought it was a rail gun
---
Mine dropped same exact way first Gambit prime match she's pretty nasty
---
Meanwhile the warlock cloak is flipping around like it's in a wind tunnel through anything and everything 
---
It definitely did not. You either messed up or someone in your house/apartment deleted it and won't admit to it. The odds that this update deleted one of your characters, across the millions of players who downloaded the update are nil. 
---
Congratulations to Bungie for managing to make Gambit even less enjoyable!

I want my sweet business to feel like an actual Gatling gun. I want shit to be fucking *BLENDED*
---
It seems to make the match a bit too long 
---
Oh yes I need it
---
I'm out of town and annoyed that I can't play.
---
Mines been stuck like that for an hour, just doing nothing...
---
Id youre asking i took out the whole opposing team once
---
I‚Äôve been trying a bunch. No luck so far but I‚Äôll stick to it

Tbh so was I

If either one of you or both have a titan, you can easily get through fights with some trial and error. There is a video or videos floating around showing a titan super clearing the end few fights pretty easily. 
---
Now people can quit bitching about the Last Word quest finally and cheese some crucible kills.

I'm on PC and I've never had an issue joining or getting a team for whisper.

They are

I just got it, too! WET!!

I think it trie to fill out armor pieces you dont have yet so you always get a full set. I aslo got a full set of one type when I was doing it earlier, no repeats. Can't 100% confirm though.
---
I hate English so much help me 
---
Yeah same here, posted about it already above.
---
gaambit prime
---
I‚Äôm 99% sure I got mine from a nightfall a long while back. It‚Äôll take some serious grinding so be prepared for that!
---
Hoo boy, I wish. I was playing Gambit yesterday with a cold so my "skills" were shit (Is this a valid excuse?) and 3 of my 4 games were with randoms and the other one against a stack. In those 4 games, 3 of them had players running around amok not collecting and I ended up having to bank Med blockers a lot, ads not getting cleared, lack of awareness of invaders, and even a whole team not gunning down the Primeval (Just shooting the small taken).
---
Why would you use that in anything other than PvP lol
---
Damn dude! That‚Äôs crazy impressive!
---
Maybe the armor set well help out a bit more in terms of damage, but i had a game not to long ago were i experienced that same thought. We had our primeval up first but  it was mostly the envoys that were holdong us back.  It that one match i got 32 guardian kills and everytime i came back i thought, "how is he not dead yet".  
---
Ps- me mentioning my 32 kills is a bit of a humble brag :), but its mostly me attempting to make the point that i felt like i shouldnt have been able to invade as much as i was and that the primeval should have been nuked well before i became fatigued by the matched.
---
—Ç—ã –ø—Ä–µ–¥–ø–æ—á–∏—Ç–∞–µ—à—å —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π ?
---
My first game was terrible. Put a bad taste in my mouth, we melted our primeval and then both primevals disappeared until it ended in a tie. Then it proceeded to end up in two more ties then we won the 4th, in an hour long gambit match :(
---
I've been using blast furnace jotunn hammerhead a bit in reckoning but tried blast furnace loaded question wardcliff in the new prime mode. Shotguns are less effective in this IMO as you want some range; rocket and grenade launchers got a nice buff. If you have a coldheart give that a whirl too wirh AR buffs
---
I think we should be holding out on T3/next Friday, or if you need to craft for the next synthesizer
---
You're at tier 1. I would imagine tier 2 is going to glow a bit more and tier 3 is going to be the full lava lamp you saw in the trailers
---
Sweet! I got one just last night. 
---
I know whisper was nerfed what is the other one ?
---
True, they did. I think it would be nice to have more content, but I do believe that this is an enormous improvement over the content drought we had this time in DC. 
---
Destiny 2 has a smart loot system where powerful gear drops are based on the highest possible level of all your gear both in your inventory and in your vault, so to answer your question: no, you do not have to equip the 651 gear in order to continuously get powerful drops. However, if you are partaking in an activity at 670 power and your highest power gear is 680 but you‚Äôre rocking 650 gear, you will still be under-leveled. 
---
Was in prime earlier we needed **1** mote!
---
Nobody came, I went and killed one vex and pulled up the primeval.
---
Where can I find this therapist? I am going away for like the whole week and can‚Äôt play any D2 because of it. Soo enough a mental breakdown is coming for me.
---
Happy pie day!
---
Rpm?
---
Yeah damn. If someone needs you to spend more time with them that‚Äôs a conversation that can be had but deleting people‚Äôs shit will not be a constructive avenue for any relationship.
---
Whoa..
---
Can I borrow some shards and dust?
---
I get ya now and totally relate. As for the invader situational awareness that can be tough for anyone. Some invaders are extremely sneaky and talented. As for ads that‚Äôs something you can learn how to handle time and time again. 
---
honestly it annoys me that people invade because they think "oh, maybe ill get a 4 man this time!", and they will run the invader armour, they keep dying and hogging the portal
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
people need to get it into their heads: if youre NOT good at invading, let a teammate do it. nobody cares about how shit you are as long as you bank motes
---
Damn, I know not everyone liked it, but I did...
---
Absolute unit 
---
I started playing at 4 pm today, and I have the full reaper, invader, and partial collector set (albeit low level)
---
I deleted my fucking game by mistake and now i have to wait until tomorrow to get in
---
(Laughs in Anthem)
---
Lmao what? Is it because you aren't good at Gambit or...?
---
It was a rough patch in which is now resolved. This was in a few years ago. Lol 
---
*YOOOOOOOOOO!!!!* It's your **2nd Cakeday** krpl88! ^(hug)
---
Happened to me too. Think it might be linked if you have another account on another system. 
---
Yeah, i got one too.no idea
---
I remember in regular gambit people argued you should wait for the initial invade before unloading supers heavy etc - in prime this seems 100% on point. Seems to be kill 2 envoys, wait for the invader and team up, kill the 3rd then do some damage. But the key seems to be (similar to the original strategy) hold your super and heavy for multiple stacks of slayer, in this case it's just waiting for multiple envoy and invader rounds since that's how slayer stacks. 
---
Chaperone
---
Same here
---
Theres also a triumph for banking your motes when your team has enough for a primeval without getting anymore. It's called Following Instructions. 
---
Man... I thought my day was bad getting stuck on initialization for the third time when I was getting ready to play tonight (Yes, I tried every trick in the book and google). I'm reinstalling now at an excruciating 500 kb/s. I came here to rant. But now I see someone else has it way worse and my problem feel insignificant. This SUCKS, dude. I hope this gets worked out. I take it you've reached out to Bungie or they've seen this post. If you have any resolve on this, please update us. I want to have faith in Bungie pulling through for these kinds of issues.
---
Typical Bungie. Oh look, the player base is enjoying this so much they‚Äôre ignoring other heavy weapons. Let‚Äôs ruin their experience.
---
I see you too have acquired the almighty üÖ±Ô∏èOX
---
Maybe in an alternative universe. Working fine here.
---
That sounds good, kinda like exotics in your vault.
---
I'm on the step to bank motes and win matches, I just need the wins now to move on. I got Breakneck last night though and it's fantastic for Prime and Reckoning as well!
---
?
---
Bubble was really good in D1. Sometimes being essential, especially in raids. Even though I still love it in D2. I do feel it gets less love than the other supers. 
---
I hate that i love it
---
I guess I have been blessed by RNGesus, cause I have most weapons, and all armour for my titan main. One or two for the hunter and warlock. 
---
Yes it's a wall of warmind stuff
---
Ammo reduced from 20 to 9
---
Ripppp
---
In the end, it doesn't even matter
---
Bugged for me too
---
Your perks look pretty god roll.
---
It one shots all majors and goblin blockers, idk I just like it. Also nice for invading if they try to rush you.
---
Well damn, I'm gonna have to look out for that! Thanks
---
It seems only masterwork weapon orbs are counting 
---
So far you've not backed up your argument, nor have you made a good offensive statement against mine. If anyone's doing corporate dick-sucking it's you for blindly following the Division for the sole reason you don't like/ aren't good at Destiny
---
Nintendo really needs to improve their console naming schemes..
---
Nice, I like it.
---
How'd you get that ghost shell?
---
Reckoning is unplayable. 9/10 matches I join are in progress with not enough time to win. 1% with 2 minutes left... bye
---
It is embarrassing how often I do this
---
It has happened to others
---
I expect mine will be the same then, I logged on after the reset and it was janky then.
---
I've managed to dig up some info on the forums. It's a known issue affecting some users where some weekly bounties aren't resetting. Bungie have said they will reset Sunday (I have 5 BA daily bounties waiting to hand in when fixed) but they are investigating the issue to hopefully fix the problem before Sunday.
---
Thankfully it will be enough time to smash out at least 2 frames for the challenge but BOO still. I hate waiting. :(

---
Yeah man me too. I just realized I am at 13000 infamy and I can reset the rank. I got it while trying to reset like before 15 mins ago
---
Tier 2 isn't avaialble yet, it'll be released on the 12th I believe.
---
Right with you brotha.
---
... how? 
---
Give us the details on how to acquire this skill, my good man 
---
Complaining for everything is not da wae...
---
Looks like he is starting his super and switching weapons at the same time (or at least very close together), the startup for that super (Blade Barrage? Not a hunter myself) involves sending him up and backwards but the weapon switch cancels it whilst still moving him from what I can see.
---
Amusing to watch tho, potential to use it to find some out of bounds locations in areas that might not have kill planes or Out of Bounds warnings.
---
So the Drifter is really just Eddie Bravo
---
Name some?
---
I see you‚Äôve forgotten about the   g o o d  d o g g o   emote...
---
If youre solo queuing don‚Äôt expect your teammates to get any better. I did 3 resets last season and it was 80% potato teammates and 20% good teammates. My advice is add the good teammates you get and queue with them later on

Yeah, lets just give every boss an immunity shield that you can only take down through a mechanic, don't let people just shoot at it and have fun 
---
Yeah it's a little bit of this and a little bit of that. Lol no two pieces are from the same set
---
Did they not boost the light level this season?
---
I don't disagree with you, I wait a little bit to make sure that people aren't trying to turn it Heroic. 
---
Oh man I didn't even think of that lol
---
Ding
---
I feel like I had the opposite problem with my fireteam. I tried to die so I could go back to the bank outside the portal to deposit my mote, AND THEY KEPT REVIVING ME! Very thoughtful of them, but not in line with my plans, haha. I can see your frustration though. But hey, day one! 
---
*Hi human!* It's your **1st Cakeday** CMD_Neopolitan! ^(hug)
---
This. 
---
I promise!
---
When I saw the emote in Eververse, I knew this meme would be inevitable. 
---
coolest meme added
---
You need to pick up your loot in the bank that you stored the mote in after a reckoning match. 
---
It‚Äôs a daily bounty

Going into a new arena and fighting enemies and then a boss is always fun in destiny and reckoning isn't any different. Didn't expect anything crazy for tier 1 either. 
---
Mad lad. 
---
Bro its been one day u need to calm down
---
Someone should edit it to do the doing doing somg from Bob's burgers
---
You want all that for free? Dude, Bungie has running costs. You cant expect them to live for years only from the initial base game money. Their employees need to eat aswell.
---
Also what are these prices? I got all for 60 euro, Base game was free last november. Forsaken was on sale for 30 euro (with the Osiris and warmind DLC included) and the new dlc pass for 30 euro. I mean if you ignore all their offers with all your might you can probably pay way more I guess.
---
Wait.. Is this real??
---
I mean they should have fixed white nail proc first.
---
I did the usual mars lost sector x3 and I didn't get anything. 
---
Is the weapon worth it tho?
---
I got mine 2 days ago took alot off work with the motes tho lol alot of scrubs running around like chicken with thier heads off  :[lol and i got breakneck yesterday üòÅ and congrats
---
Warlock has the best pve super in the game hands down
---
Also when paired with geomags chaos reach is one of the best single target damage supers in the game,if not the best right now
---
Titans are fun,good supers and abilities but not much is really outstanding just all round good
---
Why downvote then?
---
It's a Tlaloc 2.0 so...

I Dismantled for the shader I don‚Äôt like slideways

just got the hunter chest piece omfg its fucking ugly. hunters screwed again.

Currently you can get it from the Notorious Bright Engrams.
---
I saw one post of someone with that problem, also the titan that is missing
---
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY
---
This has got to be the only way to reply to hate.
---
Sadly I‚Äôm not good enough to get hate mail :(
---
Have you seen the new following instructions medal, you get it from not picking up more motes after you get enough.
---
Which blue one?
---
BIG OOF
---
Isn't that what Bungie promised they'd do before Forsaken? Never just nerf stuff but bring underperforming things to the level of others? I'm paraphrasing but that's the general idea
---
Nice roll! But I imagine with the new perks coming this season I reckon better god rolls will be coming! :D
---
Like my version of that shotgun has demolition, which gives grenade energy on kills! 4-5 kills fully recharged grenade!
---
good job posting someone's gamertag on reddit just because they were mad at losing
---
Known issue. If you have twitter follow @BungieHelp always good to keep an eye on it after updates and patches.
---
I know, right? I think it's only fair that the potential of having infinite heavy ammo in a high-damage sniper rifle should come with the caveat of... actually being able to hit shots with a sniper rifle! The nerf didn't make WotW lose any damage potential, just made it harder to take advantage of.  
---
I suspect that most of the people really unhappy with the nerf are playing on console, though. My understanding is that WotW has lower bullet magnetism on console, so it's legit harder to hit precision shots with it compared with other snipers. That one's almost irrelevant on PC - you hit where you click, period.   
---
risky click of the day
---
9 is too much of a nerf though. 15 or 14 would have been more in line. It's not even like Whisper OP for everything, just still bosses with fat precision hit spots. 
---
I read this in the patch notes hours ago, but seeing it again now I have the same reaction: that nerf is just excessive.
---
yea, btw didnt black hammer in d1 have low reserves aswell? i mean i know it was a secondairy back then but still. i always found 20 bullets reserve rediculous
---
Use the sonshot since you can chain and then just sit there
---
Thank you, I was wondering about this as well.
---
I hate to be that guy, but it's pretty easy to get the full set. But still, nice.

Welp, time to side with the Vanguard.
---
As a proud clan running 4 stacks your damn straight, it‚Äôs the best way to run this game mode with communication and coordination it makes it a lot more fun. 
---
I see your point. I guess I just enjoyed the campaigns, and liked the story. But now I can't finish it, simply because of mechanics, because I have a hard time playing with people. It just makes me sad.
---
It starts rising when you hit 110 handicap don‚Äôt know if this is right because of the higher max lvl or a bug

When you see a team lose 60 Motes at once...
---
I got mine saturday from a Mine run.
---
It is still good but of course not as good as before... I even use it in PvE sometimes.
---
Bungie did say this was an issue they looked into and wasn't that common in their play tests but they're gonna keep an eye out nonetheless
---
Holy crap that is so clean looking. Amazing job to whoever made this, it looks fantastic!
---
It says in the game on your menu when you have piece equipped. Unnecessary but still helpful.
---
My pieces have a little glow to some of them but I thought I read somewhere you needed to have all the perks unlocked...maybe I'm mistaken idk 
---
Have you heard of console?
---
Yea I know but if anyone want know bonuses before get armor then it can help.
---
I'm so sorry dude but i got the OEM from a gambit match, then got it again from a strike the same day. Though i feel your pain, i haven't got a single foresaken exotic for hunter or warlock, tho your case sir, is much worse, again, i'm sorry
---
From what I've gathered there are 3 tiers of armor, right now we can only get tier 1, tier 2 will drop March 8th with Reckoning Tier 2 and tier 3 (cool glowy armor) will be available March 15th along with Invitations of the Nine and Reckknjng tier 3, there is a roadmap inage you can search up on google and it tells you when quests and extras drop
---
It's a bug. Doesn't glow in social spaces (the tower, the farm) or in ui screens but it's being fixed. Go to a patrol zone and pull out a sword to see if there's a difference to standing around in the tower. 
---
3 tiers of armor with the 3 tiers of reckoning. T3 is probably going to be the glowy stuff. 
---
Also says that in game -_-
---
It starts increasing multiplier only above 100 handicap, for some reason.
---
How could anyone complain about season of the drifter? I've only played it for like 3 hours and I love it!
---
I've gotten to play one Gambit prime match I lost but it was still a lot of fun and destroying prime makes so much more sense now like the envoys have a purpose although I kept getting sniped which wasn't fun then I ran out of ammo which is kinda where my fun died for about thirty seconds then j got heavy so we running good so far in day two of season of drifter 
---
Not really, level means nothing and Forsaken is worth every cent
---
How much for it? ;)
---
Swing, i think. I don't know why though. 
---
Try reckoning, I was making win progress on a gambit bounty inside reckoning 
---
#DESTINATION BOUNTIES
---
If you got a good roll you can kill on sniper range with it. It's a realy nasty weapon in the right hands. If you time the precharge they won't even know what hit them and they are already dead. 
---
I‚Äôve PM‚Äôd you

Random stat rolls? What do you mean by this?

\#ANSWER IS RIGHT HERE BOYS
---
Ahh! Makes sense :) thanks so much!
---
Can‚Äôt wait for it :D
---
What is the megan perk?
---
It's the tier 1 defenders set bonus (forget the name), multi kills grand you a stacking buff that will make you do more damage to the next taken you hit.

---
They can do that after we kill Drifter in S7 and Cayde returns to take his place.
---
The exact same thing happened to me but with Ada-1, I had no bounties in my inventory but it still says I‚Äôve already completed the bounties 
---
This is a glitch that happened to my friend too, but it happened whenever I died invading
---
Not that I know of. Amazon could have some ps4 ones though. Personally I'm hoping for an official sale somewhere on spring break - a friend of mine is sure that it will be then for some reason, but he doesn't have any proof as well.
---
This sub just likes to overdramatize / meme about changes in general.
---
You still rock the very same dps and it's still top tier in the same situations; you are just not allowed to miss so much anymore, otherwhise the perk will still give you unlimited ammo.
---
LMAO I see rwby I upvote
---
Ding 
---
It will not hold your hand, you decide what you want to do.
---
Was lurking on your profile, but I have to say this.
---
Those are really good ghost tattoo designs, I love it wow 
---
This season iron banana will get an high impact fusion so you will be able to get one there (triumph reward) 
---
Its just a little prick
---
When you hit the fattest blunt and realize your so high there isn‚Äôt even a blunt
---
Alright alright alright.... 
---
You will have to look up tons of things if you want to do specific things like find the sleeper stimulant or getting the escalation protocol gear YouTube / Google if you don't look it up you'll just do Mindless questing. You're so have to YouTube The Raid and less you have a team that teaches you how to do it. oh so you can't get any of the old season gear either like season 1 season 2 and stuff if you want random rolls you have to pay for forsaken. 
---
I honestly see why people are complaining so much. This just punishes people who aren't accurate. But if you aren't accurate, why are you using Whisper?
---
I'm getting sentry synths by killing blockers.
---
I bought the complete edition ._.
---
Thanks. I'm an idiot.
---
True, I‚Äôm just hoping that it‚Äôs like 75% instead of 67% in PvE but takes longer to ramp up because it‚Äôs 5x instead of rampage 3x
---
\*posts on r/destiny2 instead of r/DestinyTheGame\*
---
It still annoys me how the cutscenes are still at 30 fps
---
I still think he looks alright alright alright.
---
Do reserve perks work on exotics?
---
Ding.
---
Nope game still sucks and bungie can't take there head out of there ass and make it fun all they do is nurf shit for no fucking reason also put new items into the game then throw it away evey session 
---
Yes, always
---
Thats why light reactor and J√∂tunn is OP
---
It's still useable which is a surprise to be sure.
---
hey what's the Parappa mashup you used at the start?
---
Motes of Dank
---
No need to replace them, use this until your ult is ready and swap to shards
---
Hmm, I could have swore I tried rocket launcher reserves with my Wardcliff last night and didn't see a difference.  I'll have to do some more testing.
---
My mouth is waterimg
---
Stupid me didn't censored the name so mods had to remove it (no witch-hunt rule) 
---
So fuck the new people also people who played dont use it the perks are trash so make them available again with random rolls two new players and old players also then bungee wouldn't have to work as hard to get new content and could put it towards something that has no use in the game that's in there right now
---
[it uses this picture from r/destiny2](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/axv5t0/leaving_this_here_for_reaction_memes/) 
---
My warlock experience is making rifts when I try to dodge. Am I alone in the plight?
---
I bet half the people who played during that time don't even play the game anymore
---
Ty for tip.
---
*with no eyelashes*
---
I understand. I enjoy Gambit but it's at the bottom of the list of priorities. I'm not expecting to play much until I've knocked out the other pinnacle weapons. 
---
You are going to hear talk about Gambit because there is nothing in strikes or crucible to talk about. Wait a week until new quests drop and the discussion will expand. 
---
The drifter is trippin on acid i killed the invader after he shot once at a dude with like 10 motes the drifter then said every voiceline that would be associated with that circumstance including the lines for if my teammate died and if my teammate  killed him
---
Does it drop drop prime ? 
---
Bump your handicap to 100 or higher.
---
I believe they've done it this way to keep the Nightfalls somewhat relevant now that the power cap is 700.
---
Ps4, and PC, but mainly PC. I very rarely play on PS4 anymore.
---
The tracking is actually not that good (especially in this clip, you were basically on him and he didnt move much at all)
---
Walking and/or jumping can make the J√∂tunn miss quite easily
---
Raid bosses are usually harder than shooting some wizards and then standing in a circle 
---
Yeah, that was a cool touch.
---
I got this too after playing with 2 clan mates ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
This should be a kind of bug. Because bungie did't say anything about nightfall has changed in patch note.
---
They changed it I believe. You'll have to add modifiers and up the power handicap to get the same effect. 
---
Last time I used it I died to fall damage.
---
What does cross counter mean?
---
Well I see your point, but I think seasonal exclusives is a necessary vanity aspect of the game that can show dedicated playtime during that season.
---
You should change the subtitles to *doots intensely* 
---
Look at how they massacred my boy
---
Started playing warlock in pvp 2 weeks ago after playing hunter main since d1 beta and the 6 weeks before that for the OEM (which i never got) and easy ran out of medals. Warlock is just the best in terms of movement in pvp. 
---
They‚Äôve fixed it for the most part, is a bit laggy the first few times playing. But they should fix that with the patch next reset 
---
I don't get how the community doesn't want all the stuff in the game they took out back. And how they don't want random rolls on all of your one stuff
---
I agree, I am ok with the changes. I can actually use many other weapons now.  One change I think was odd was the change to SMG.  Slight buff to body damage and slight reduction to precision damage...what? haha  
---
My Hero's burden seem to be doing even better in gambit though, so no complaints :D 
---
If it makes you feel many better, I didn't understand what they were either.
---
I hope he has one where he pukes the coins out and grabs the one for the enemies like that card trick.
---
There's a fixed one in the comments of that post tho
---
Not a bug it‚Äôs working as intended
---
Its because on console the change of the damage model back with forsakens made them almost useless. This was to try and improve QOL and im liking it so far
---
[Source](https://twitter.com/a_dmg04/status/1103005154733830144?s=21) 
---
it's not long enough
---
ow for sure! Also, it is so easy to get trapped on this new map. Those freaking harpies man... 
---
Nah its been nothing but cabal for me
---
i got hunter arms yesterday
---
I really want the samurai iron banner set in season 4, but I understand it should stay exclusive for people who played it back then. There's a new set this season that also looks pretty cool. What do you mean specifically about the random rolls? If you mean the ability to reroll perks I 100% agree with you. 
---
Well, out light level gets higher, the nightfall is 540, so it makes sense that we need more extra light level to get more points.
---
Tbf, before the change we got the 100k (and much more) with the handicap without actually making the strike any harder at all.
---
Ding bitch!!!!
---
Nope! ;(
---
Ordered before a certain date. Like an original batch maybe.
---
This is because your mote bank is under attack by blockers draining them. YOU didn't lose 12 notes, your TEAM did from it's banked pool
---
This is blasphemy!
---
because it looks badass
---
Man I generated 98 orbs in a strike using Nova + Skull Of Dire Ahamkara and it counted as 7..... FK this!
---
(also drops queenbreaker and OEM)
---
Laughs in stormtrance
---
Congrats. I got the new hunter gauntlets after like 5 reckoning runs, but I think those gauntlets perks are so dumb. Like there aren't many swords that are even useful so why use those gloves
---
LFG
---
It really just saves you about 5 euros and might give additional trouble. 
---
That's what RAIDS are for.  Not everything has to be mechanics.  Sometimes people just want to shoot sh\*t.
---
Yes you can buy it. I bought it 3 weeks ago and I`m from europe, everything went smooth, remember that there are currency conversion fees but don't worry you still pay less than euro: the pass in euro was 34.99, I bought it on us site at 34.99USD which means around 30 euro and with the conversion fees was about 32‚Ç¨. Profit :) 
---
Drifter is a member of a ska band confirmed.
---
You can probably make another account and do the same. And are you sure its a lower price in a different country?
---
Backup plan is the key.
---
Bank those motes!
---
I was going to update this but fell asleep. Uninstalling the KB4482887 is what solved my issue. Thank you for all the assistance.
---
Why are you here on the Destiny 2 subreddit?
---
My exact reaction when I got a God Roll Gnawing Hunger the first Prime match I ever played...but it was a Ooooo of joy üòÇ
---
Did they also nerf Ikelos?
---
That titan lookd way too akinny
---
So annoying, downloaded as alarm clock ringtone-.-
---
I hate it :l made me regret getting annual last night
---
Wait so the multiplier isn't doing anything?
---
Yo those fking dog thralls are no joke lmao
---
Does it though?
---
yea it's pretty fuckin cool
---
I love and appreciate you for this. 
---
Oh come on, they were lvl 50. People nuking the boss while you're trying to activate the heroic is frustrating
---
I sIdE wItH uNclE DrIfTeR cOs Im ToO bAdAsS
---
Ah I think I get it! 
---
Breakneck - Area1 - Gambit
---
Lunas Howl - Area2- Crucible
---
X - Area3 - Strikes?
---
Im confused.  100% of what to 30% of what? 
---
You've never had to google anything about destiny? 
---
Beat me to it. Bungie even said it was for this exact reason, player diversity and choice.
---
and their a warlock with full super and the exotics to match
---
It's still the same buff of 26%
---
The handicap needs to be above 100 in order for the multipliers to be applied. See [this tweet](https://twitter.com/A_dmg04/status/1103005154733830144?s=20) from DMG
---
Do you know abt PlayStation
---
Just make sure you *bank those motes, sister*
---
I imagine over this first weekend of Tier 2, a lot of people will likely be a bit underleveled unless they grind a whole ton.
---
Didn‚Äôt know what I was expecting combing here lol 
---
I did that once just to runaway and hide in the trees for 30 seconds. It worked...
---
Exactly people are acting like we have nothing anymore and its just sad
---
Yeah, especially with all those glitched bounties.
---
Super energy that you get back from kills
---
He means that the game should be explaining these things so you don't have to use google.
---
Its been fixed to suit 700 power
---
Your multiplier doesn't go up until you pass 100 handicap 
---
Cause tier 2 to use the middling modes unlocks Friday. That's why you couldn't use it
---
To me, yes, I like black armory weapons. 
---
fair
---
I need 1 more reset for dredgen :(
---
Please reply to comments
---
I feel you. I was just really frustrated that night because me and the boys were playing comp, and we couldn't get on a decent win streak to get luna's. Honestly i was venting and i am happy about the gun changes. No longer can i just get badlander aped from 20 meters away because he has 5 bullets in the mag.
---
I think I was using a Bad Omens + Jotunn when playing this match(I swapped loadouts around a lot). 
---
In this match I just spammed Jotunn with the occasional rocket from the well whenever I got the chance. 
---
Don‚Äôt forget about the sweat 
---
reduced ammo reserves to 9, so it's a lot more punishing if you miss.
---
Previously armor was locked to a specific stat roll. I.e. the Hunter Vangaurd armor set (Vigil of Heroes) would always drop as "Heavy Armor" having increased resilience. It can now drop as Heavy, Survival or Mobility type. 
---
Same goes for all other armor. The resilience, restorative, and mobility stats are no longer locked.
---
What, like The Last Word, that everyone and their dog is carrying now?
---
I have yet to play a gambit prime match because I‚Äôm afraid to be just destroyed since I solo queue. But I would love to see someone just unleash havoc with Acrius and well of radiance or something. If that‚Äôs a possibility rn
---
Um no. Just no. Halo, Call Of Duty, World Of Warcraft (or any mmorpg), The Division, Elder Scrolls Online, etc.
---
It's not really that much more difficult than regular Gambit.
---
Pretty much the same, just kill stuff, bank motes, then kill the envoys and dps the Primeval, rinse and repeat. 
---
Score!
---
Let me direct you to r/woooosh
---
Interesting. I've never had that issue personally.
---
Ok, one more gambit prime game and I'm done.
---
*plays gambit prime*
---
Well, now I have a mote for the reckoning, why not use it right now...
---
*plays reckoning*
---
Ding on the field 
---
its very very different, they left old gambit because there are people that love it.
---
This version however is all the feedback mushed in with some Bungie love and its way different 
---
Upvoting m o r e
---
Ding!
---
Holy s\*\*t thats a beauty!
---
Let them run. You will hunt them where they hide.
---
Drifter needs to be screaming in that player's ear to get to the bank. That player's ghost needs to be screaming in the player's ear.
---
And finally, after a bit your teammates should be able to shoot you and get _all_ of the motes if you're holding back.
---
Ok, not finally. With Prime, there is a point that makes sense to hold onto the motes until others bank it as well, to start taking motes out of their bank, but I haven't quite figured out how to communicate this with others that I'm going to bank and they should too. 
---
These are childish comments from someone who is a child and/or has a child's mind.
---
We've all killed someone in a game to receive a message along the theme of "reported, video sent to X publisher/studio"
---
If these folks are adult they are so shit at life they should go play something that doesn't fuck with their blood pressure &amp; heart rate or just stop playing period.
---
Nah instead of a random one, do a mix of all the factions/races and he's like good luck guardians.
---
I just used Golden Gun to pop titans in super when they invaded.... and then one rocket titan who came at us across the map, he took an arrow in the head 3 times till he was dead.
---
Same happened to me last night and I am fucking late for work today :(
---
Just get a 4 stack all agreed on it. Try the subreddit discord. Not too hard if you are all on the same page for it.
---
What do you own of d2 content atm?
---
Just read up on the perk, yeah, totally useless.  I do use sword.  As someone mentioned,does the developer even play Destiny 2???
---
k
---
They both look awful tbh. 
---
I said I‚Äôd get sixth coyote as my first forsaken exotic armor drop. It happened. Needless to say, my disappointment was immeasurable, and my day was ruined. 
---
lots of bugs around, wouldn't be surprised if this is one of the bugs.
---
There's two maps? I've just seen the one with the moving platforms.
---
Go on a Destiny tracker and look at your recent matches and it should give you a report of the people that were in the match
---
Titan on the enemy team in Gambit was using this when we invaded and it really puts the pressure on when you have an invincible sword-bearing Titan flying at you lol
---
I‚Äôm not too concerned with it since dlc came out yesterday, but still, I‚Äôm a little sad I can‚Äôt complete it haha
---
yep
---
Alternately, for the last set, have the person that jumps to 7, stay on seven. Then then person from 6 jumps to 8 and the rest of the group trails along with the person that was on 7 taking up the back of the pack once everyone else has passed. 
---
This makes it so only your first couple people need to really know what‚Äôs going on and there is less room for error since no one will have to jump over a platform. 
---
Well the only version of the game you can buy digitaly comes with forsaken. Then for about 20 dollars more you get the next 3 expansions 
---
It may very well change between now and the time I complete my set, but so far my limited interaction with Prime has led me to the conclusion that standard Gambit (with blueberries) is slightly more organized. I've been lucky enough 85% of the time to get matched with others who either love to invade, collect, or hunt. I do fairly well with "reaper" role. Once I've identified the HVT I can usually melt them pretty quick. 
---
I also get that these new armor sets are geared to help easily identify these individual roles and should theoretically improve the experience, but I do love best 2 out of 3. Gives a team a chance to rally. 
---
Ayyy! I got the new warlock gauntlets today!
---
The second one doesn't go into rotation until next Tuesday but it's on Titan so it'll be Hive and Fallen and maybe Cabal
---
Dong
---
Ahh
---
*Laughs in Rivensbane/Cursebreaker. \*puts dredgen back in the closet\**
---
and this is where i'd put my last word.....oh wait.......FUCKING 2ND STEP!
---
Perfect, a google search was only showing the game bundle with expansions.
---
Thanks everyone!
---
No they shouldn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs easy to dodge and you only get killed by it if you play dumb 
---
i think i had this one as well from last night ... :)
---
You do realise that people, especially in front of a crowd, act very different from each other upon failure but one person wouldn't be on one side of the spectrum in one situation and the opposite in another? That's called personality, something many characters in destiny lack already, even though it got a bit better recently
---
Enough Foolin around Bungo
---
I am always willing to help spread the good word of Debris. 
---
cool, also, what is that warlock doing?
---
Yeah he's got a few new lines of dialog for old Gambit! It helps add clarity and isn't so vague anymore. He'll say things like "Portal is ready! Go take out the enemy team to deny their motes" or something like that instead of the old "Portal is ready!" gist. The added sudden death match for a tied score is pretty intense too. 
---
tuh you thought Guardians played gambit to win?
---
I see, thank you very much 
---
Yup, then we get 2 small blockers who are jerking off the large thats already giving our motes a good succ
---
Well, it does make sense
---
Awesome! I'll probably be mostly in Gambit Prime to get the new stuff but I'm excited to jump into OG Gambit as well. It's nice to see them refreshing old content in addition to adding new things. 
---
The game gave me the option... 
---
You can clearly see the name of the person in the video.
---
You then, whether it was your intention to or not, shone that person in a bad light online for everyone to see with his name fully visible.
---
That is witch hunting. Blind ignorance is not an excuse, even if I believed it.
---
Have a good day too!
---
Yeah I agree that everyone has a personality but are you denying that everyone makes mistakes and gets embarrassed about making a mistake? Drifter drops coins (mistake) in front of 8 guardians who are probably having a chuckle since they‚Äôve seen him handle those coins a lot without ever messing up. You‚Äôre telling me he doesn‚Äôt want to transmat them ASAP? Have it happen every once in awhile, it‚Äôs definitely not a big deal. You‚Äôre taking these characters way too seriously.
---
I'm happy with it. Not sure why everyone is tripping out over $10 worth of content. We get a new game mode, 3 new exotic armor pieces, a new exotic weapon (+1 more later) and a ton of lore.
---
People just love to complain. 
---
Fusion rifle by name, railgun by nature
---
I did lol
---
Mayhem is your best friend for this 
---
Just like the meatball, random small chance
---
Haha
---
What platform are you on?
---
No, i havent gone into the crucible this season and i got the bounty completed in gambit. 
---
It could be arc burn instead of arc singe. 
---
I agree...maybe next time don't tell people about cool tricks.  Just like if you have an extended mag on your machinegun and pick up power ammo in crucible/gambit, you get more ammo.  sshhh.
---
I kinda love how ridiculously huge the new ships are. 
---
Depends on your playstyle. Titan is more tanky dos style. Warlock is healing mainly. Hunter is much mobility high damage.
---
How‚Äôs it been nerfed? Haven‚Äôt been paying attention 
---
Na you are not alone. I despise gambit. After 6 resets to actually get Dregen I have had enough of it to last me a lifetime. I have played 5-6 hours of prime and the reckoning and I think its crap. The only thing I will be going for this DLC is Thorn and playing The Division 2 instead.
---
what is that emblem on your hunter?
---
XB1
---
I see where GameStop has the Legendary Edition on sale for 30 bucks. I hate GameStop but probably cheapest option.
---
Tag yourself, I'm a Reaper
---
Na, hes not.
---
Xur comes on Fridays and goes away at reset on Tuesday
---
Like the OP, I did the bounty on the wrong week and opened the chest. Will it let me do the bounty again on Curse week, or will the portal be opened for me since I've already done it once?
---
Or just face them that will make them rank up faster and out of your range :P   You might get lucky and win too, never know until you try because they could be a nub clan with purchased Lunas haha 
---
Alright, alright, alright
---
https://vimeo.com/321816777
---
I got a collector after banking 15 motes... But I didn't get one when I banked 15 more. Out the 15 after that...
---
Yeah that‚Äôs the kicker too, never mind just getting the meatball, having to beat it as well
---
Too soon
---
I‚Äôd recommend masterworking it, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs equal perk wise, but stat wise hammerhead is a direct upgrade from avalanche 
---
Thank you for the correction! And that makes a lot of sense, the new weapons seem to have a chance to drop alongside synths while playing Prime. I myself got a curated SMG for killing an HVT, a Reaper synth dropped with it. People in my clan also reportedly got weapons by banking motes alongside Collector synths and by doing invasion stuff!
---
*You‚Äôre killin‚Äô me Smalls!*
---
Bruh
---
I'm over 50 lol, hoping this week :)
---
Do stuff in game related to the synth- kill stuff for reaper, kill blockers (maybe invaders) for sentry, etc
---
Brah

Came back a couple of weeks ago and I just hacked through all the story missions I missed with a couple of breaks for some strikes of daily objectives when my gear started falling a bit short, just take note that you won't be able to infuse any favourite gear you had for quite a bit since enhancement cores are thing now.
---
Man, what the fuck.
---
Lol i literally just did it with randos no problem
---
Amazing 
---
Bro, this is some amazing art. Granted, it is a bit too soon for this, but hey. We will remember him. This is a beautiful piece.
---
Thanks, man! I haven't given it a go yet, but was curious.
---
Are you cute, projecting your bullshit on me. When are you gonna tell me to "SuB tO PeWds" your gay-ass Lord and Savior?
---
Git gud n00b

I thought Zavala was being a nervous nellie through Warmind right up until Rasputin's little speech at the end.
---
Eww
---
I recently moved in with a woman... I had to explain to her the concept of "nerdrage" last night as I started yelling at the screen because of mouth breathers doing this lol. She thought it was funny
---
Yeah that's exactly what I was thinking
---
See you in hot
---
Obsidian mind and bjj
---
I would start your search in your local church 
---
It's definitely a refreshing way to get these weapons, feels amazing when you do something cool and get rewarded instantly.
---
You could also eat your money but I don't know why you would
---
This post is all right , all right  all right. 
---
I only played a few rounds last night after I got off work late and hadn't had a chance to look up the set perks.  Saved me a few spare minutes.  Thanks for this.
---
blocked out of forging frames this week because of a stupid glitch feelsbadman
---
We are getting there I‚Äôve got collector my clan mate has sentry we are working on invader and reaper we have bits but not full yet. Definitely coordinations the key to success running private matches with your clan as well to get a good understanding of the maps the spawns etc makes you way more effective because once those wells go down for prime evil your vulnerable af to a complete wipe 
---
You could also eat your money but I don't know why you would expect to get it back.
---
You can still make the weak notes with the upgraded one btw
---
Well here's hoping we don't get poisoned again now that The Speaker isn't around to sell us that infusion of Light.
---
Prolly next week on maint day :S I haven't read anything about applied fixes/patch 
---
No i bought the ornament

I didn‚Äôt either until Bergusia forge &amp; scourge

You‚Äôre invading! Make a mess

Ohhh thanks man. I have it.

There‚Äôs Vex Milk on the field!

Truth. I play Crucible infrequently, but will Gambit a go solo.

It looks to my like the blue ornament for the solstice of heroes cloak

Hate to break it to you, but

&gt;!Shin Malphur is Dredgen Vale!&lt;

It is. I've just reacquainted it. Thanks dude.

Np :)

Should‚Äôve played another

Nope. It's the solstice blue cloak.

damn, I heard about it :( Hopefully they can patch it for you guys soon. I mean before next week but bungo :S

Oh yeah I know. I'll need to wait for Flashpoint :(

My stuff does the exact same thing a lot of the time. I just let go and try again..usually works on the 2nd or 3rd try

Why did I read the first part like junior browns rap song with Chris Brown from the clevlend show?

Damm you 100% need to sort some stuff out. And you dont even have to keep all guns. The exocits you can always get back from collection. I made myself a raid and pvp gear of each class and a fix weapon load out for all 3 chars with all perks optimized for them. On hunter i mainy use impuls/shot so my perks are all optimited for that . And i only use the iron banner / raid gear
---
Ooooooh you're right. i forgot about the warsat launchers, I was only thinking about the computing power in the vault itself.   The warsat launchers only make sense if it was strategic positioning to spread the warsats as far as possible.
---
I get frustrated when people bank anything less than 5 motes (even if we only need, like, 3 to summon). That‚Äôs just a waste if you ask me.
---
Mine too! Any idea how to get another?
---
Seriously. This is why I hate pvp of any kind these days. Even joining people for strikes and raids is annoying. People are so stuck up online and are just compete asshats these days. I feel like more and more of them are coming online. Then you've got younger age groups that see these guys saying and doing things like this and think it's cool and that's what you have to do. Just ridiculous. 
---
So nothing on story missions hey? Alright thanks man. 
---
Honestly it's more of a problem how tedious it is to level. Didn't most legendary gear drop at a higher level in D1? Now here we are coming in every week for a handful of prime engrams.
---
 Nice. 
---
I got an outlast energy pulse rifle with drop mag kill clip and under pressure.  Not sure if I like it yet.  Seems good but a bit inaccurate. 
---
What would be a god roll for it?
---
The guy was probably younger than 13 at least
---
They have an easy system regarding clans. You can always join our clan!
---
Truth if you are holding "0" motes get your ass out there and hunt the invader!!
---
I'm sorry my guy, I'm on xbox :(

Just curious, why? 
---
You only drop some of them, not all.
---
Don't fret yet. It's probably a glitch. The synths are meant to be consumable items, so I'm confident they'll drop regularly after the team has a week or two to work the kinks out.
---
I was grinding patrols on Mars for resonant stems and I got the triumph as well.
---
Ah ok collector set players can still put the team in a bad spot then.
---
Where‚Äôs Fortnite?
---
Nice, thanks
---
Engrams stay at the power level they are when they dropped. There's no reason to hold on to engrams. 
---
The power level of quest items depends on the quest. Main campaign items are at set power levels, so for example the No Turning Back bow you get from the Forsaken campaign is always 410 no matter what power level you are when you complete that mission. Side quest rewards work differently, though, and it's all pretty complicated and non-intuitive. Exotic quests added in the first year of the game are stuck at either 260 or 380, while exotic quests added in the second year of the game (Forsaken and later) are all considered "powerful gear" for the level they drop at. 
---
In general, once you are above 500, expect all loot to be below you except prime engrams and things stated to be "powerful." Prime engrams and powerful loot drops will all be anywhere from 1 to 7 above you. 
---

High stakes high reward. If you‚Äôre a bad shot just use sniper reserve perks. The nerf makes the gun spicier, it‚Äôs just so powerful something had to happen. 15 in res would be too mild. 
---
I got the grenade perk on my scout which is amazing and takes like 4 kills to recharge a nade
---
Thanks for the reassurance
---
Didn‚Äôt know that when I commented, that changes things. So they can now waste 17 motes instead of 15.
---
And that's when I tell them, "Have a nice day!" then promptly report and block them. Not worth the headache.
---
ROLL TIDE
---
I got it with firmly planted and rangefinder with high zoom scope (even more range) and projection fuse
---
So annoying lol
---
git gud brah!
---
And then you look again and its 20 motes
---
I just couldn't resist tbh
---
‚ÄúWut?‚Äù
---
Well if you were willing to ally with the Spider and Calus maybe I would've sided with you Zavala ü§®
---
I got geomaga from my 2nd gambit prime. Bungie knew how to get me hooked.
---
Bungie knows what‚Äôs up
---
I'm not a big handcannon user, but the two that I actually like and use are Malfeasance from Gambit, and Midnight Coup from Leviathan. 
---
Its 2 kills per 1%
---
Blame the Flash.
---
'already'
---
I laughed way to hard at this comment. Take my up vote. 
---
I forgotten about Duke thanks.  
---
the fucking comments on the tweet
---
Alright alright alright, I get you're not a fan, hotshot. Lemme just tell ya, don't look outside your house cause...
---
VEX CABAL HIVE AND FALLEN ON THE FRONT YARD! 
---
Better grab a sword.
---
(END DRIFTER THREAT)
---
Lmao yeah
---
I honestly doubt you can't get it anymore considering I finished one of the triumphs for it last night.
---
Make sure you're playing regular gambit and not Prime. 
---
There‚Äôs your problem right there. You‚Äôre calling this DLC. It‚Äôs not. This is not an expansion. It‚Äôs smaller content updates that add a variety of different things to earn and chase along with a few extras like cutscenes here and there and a quest or two plus more.
---
I think the annual pass so far has been successful for what it is. It‚Äôs 40 dollars for 3/4‚Äôs of a year worth of seasonal content updates. I would MUCH rather have this system than have what we‚Äôve had in the past. TTK launched and we didn‚Äôt get an update until mother fucking April. And that update wasn‚Äôt even as big as these that we are getting now. Would it be awesome to get substantial DLC expansions about as often as we are getting these seasonal updates? Sure, maybe. But that‚Äôs just not feasible.
---
The people at Bungie work hard to make the best game for the best community of people. That being said they are still just humans working at their jobs. Better not super humans that can bust out DLCS every 3 months. I really think we‚Äôve gotten on a very good track as far as delivering satisfying content that comes often enough to keep the game from becoming too dry and empty. I‚Äôm not sure exactly what your deal is with the annual pass but the fact that you just simply say it all sucks shows me that you are just a ignorant and naive simpleton. There‚Äôs definitely decent content within the annual pass and like I said before I think Bungie has at least found the foundation of what could be a great system for keeping this game interesting and ever expanding at a rate that keeps people happy and engaged.
---
Now I‚Äôm not fan-boying, I just think it‚Äôs incredibly dumb and petty to say ‚Äúthe dlc sucks‚Äù. If you don‚Äôt like it then that‚Äôs fine, you don‚Äôt have to. But the content definitely doesn‚Äôt suck and the system or way that we are getting these updates is definitely an improvement or step in the right direction. Maybe I‚Äôm in the minority. But I like to believe I‚Äôm not and that people are generally pleased with the annual pass so far.
---
How did you get it?
---
Midnight coup suits every environment. 
---
Lolololol this guys talking shit so he can befriend you to play destiny 2 with him. How very sad lol. Like I said you‚Äôre only going to get attention from lonely ass reddit dwellers. The same people who are also looking for attention
---
Don't try this at home.
---
Duke 44. Outlaw rampage reserves mod. 
---
Mine had 13 in the hole and after 3 hs kills becomes a monster for the next 10. 
---
Caveat no one uses primaries for boss dps. Ok?  ;). 
---
Hopefully 
---
Thanks for clarifying, and have a nice day/night :D
---
It‚Äôs not comparable in the sense that with forsaken, destiny 2 becomes an entirely new experience 100x greater than base d2. The dreaming city and exotics are worth it alone in my opinion!
---
I'm gonna go ahead and side with Horsedick.MPEG
---
Look at badass over here who never misses a shot, eh?
---
A L A B A M A 1 0 0
---
Bungie has acknowledged that many things that should tick for any gambit game are not for prime. When they will fix it tho is another question...
