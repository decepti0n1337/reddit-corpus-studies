I believe they nerfed Dawnblade to bring it line with the nerf they did to Juggernaut Fists of Havoc.

---
---
This is probably the only version of this meme that has fit so well.
---

---
the "why would **** do this?" is fine, but the murdering of a thing + "that other worse thing" is so much better.
---
.... in other words, i like it
---
I think it's Orin, before she became Emissary
---
I did less damage hitting only head shots than hitting some bodies and a few crits.
---
Yes. Yes it can 
---
Destiny was made on pc with controller support
---
I want Shaxx's armor for my titan......any titans agree? üòèüòé
---
 I just need the cursebreaker give me the damm ship bungie
---
If you somehow get an analog mouse you can or use a controller on pc
---
Well there is the middle tree sentinel
---
Headseeker will Buff critical damage if you hit the body in the same burst. Guessing that's why-
---
Yeah the minute you try to clear them they teleport behind cover, and before you can chase them down an invader blows you to hell with Jotunn.
---
I dont have head seeker.
---
40¬£ :)
---
If you read the post it says i think the gun has built in headseeker.
---
I still hate that there's so little indication in game what steps you should take to make events heroic. I had to look most of them up myself.
---
How are you not at 400? ü§™
---
Maybe it's down to how Damage numbers are rounded? No decimals are shown? I'm just spitballing here.
---
No kidding those forums are cancer. I use firefeams as well but I can‚Äôt browse the forums anymore.
---
Like I get the game has faults but goddamn they bitch too much
---
Totally cool if that's how you write it in the UK. Just not how it's written in the US.
---
Ahh I stopped playing. And cus I got a pc and didn‚Äôt by ps+ anymore.
---
that‚Äôs fair, but i think my point still stands. forsaken is what d2 should‚Äôve been like at launch, and anthem has only been out for like 2 months tops
---
I'll be honest the punctuation/grammar of the post slipped me up with trying to understand it.
---
It is Destiny.  They could take turns murdering him.
---
Ah. Wish D2 dropped exotics as much as D1 did.
---
Hitting all crits should always out shoot hitting bodies to head. With by gones it does not.
---
You're a good friend.
---
Sorry. I hate typing lmao.
---
The best was when u were wanting a specific type of exotic and u got that engram.
---
Thankee-Sai?
---
Understandable same lol
---
Maybe High impact reserves is bugged?
---
Ugly
---
use what makes u happy
---
binkercad
---
For those curious eyes
---
I‚Äôm using:
---
Truesight HCS
---
Range finder
---
Light Mag
---
Kill clip
---
Ranger master work
---
Yeah it was. Or getting exactly the exotic you wanted. Ran a nightfall once and made a joke about getting gjallahorn. Ended up getting it when we killed the boss.
---
Titan helmet that you get from barons in missions. Always have heavy lifting and heavy finder with a super mod
---
Not gonna lie. I hope they never nerf spectral blades
---
You'll need to use a converter, there will be some input lag, so that's something you will have to judge for yourself whether or not you can tolerate it. There is the Astro C40tr as well, but the controller is brand new, so there's no telling if it escaped the flawed durability issues of the other "pro" ps4 controllers.
---
Check the link to his IG, he has a video up. It‚Äôs before he painted it, still cool none the less.
---
I don't understand why it's so hard to score criticals on them. What is their hitbox?!
---
With you
---
Troll it is then. The fist time you hit it once for 20 and twice for 32, and then three times for 32. 
---
the second time you hit them twice for 32 both times. Yeah ofc it's less damage when you miss your shots.
---
D1 vanilla was better
---
PUUUUUUUUUUUUAAAAAAAAA...üëèüèøüëèüèøüëèüèø
---
That quest in d1 was the bane of my existence for about a week. But oh boy when I finally got that sexy gun I was ecstatic
---
It actually does more but the highest number able to be displayed is 999,999
---
I appreciate that. Seriously. 
---
Growing up I was the one who wished my dad was like all the other good ones. Without giving a life sob story, my childhood was rough. Mental torture, physical violence. And some parental Kidnappings along the way. 
---
To hear anyone at all say they want to be the dad I am, is a life goal. I only wanted to be anything but the man who chose my name. I‚Äôve always resented being named after him. But names are just names. And it only tells someone how to call my attention.
---
Thanks
---
I'd love to play with you guys! Blind Hysteria is my gamertag:) I still got some light leveling to go tho
---
Reckoning to me is lots of fun. He seems to enjoy as well. Never done!? Well I ain‚Äôt R3ckl3ssR0b if I would allow that to continue much longer. Definitely should link up soon
---
It's a loot based game. What else do you expect?
---
You, sir, are a father we all strive to be for our kids. Not perfect in any one way, but everything your son needs you to be. 
---
Also, u/dmg04 and u/cozmo23
---
Middle tree arcstrider all the way
---
$140... For a keyboard that lights up and semi pressable keys?
---
I'm under the impression that PC's can do anything consoles can do, except to do it better, or the same, you have to pay x3 the amount of money. The only difference is controller preference. And preferably... I want my Wiimote and Nunchuck back.
---
I expect incentivizing the loot aspect
---
&gt;  The goal is straightforward and clear. Get to fabled, get rewarded. You don't need to do a bunch of side shit 
---
Ah but you do!  Look at any of the recommendations for how to hit Fabled.  First you have to figure out what time of day to play the game, then you have to weed out and find players of similar skill level who are stuck at lower rankings, then you have to pray that P2P connections don't screw you, and pray your teammates will all connect to the match if you're not 4 stacking.  What ever happened to the days of learning the maps and working on your aim?
---
&gt;Back in my day we'd grind 3 10 hour days worth for a single level up, only to die and lose 4 hours worth of exp. When you finally got there, it meant something because not just anyone could do it. Nowadays, games like that are scarce, so players have never "felt" what true gratification via hard work feels like.
---
Maybe that's because developers learned they can't exclusively cater to the adolescents with no job or income, and had to make the game more accessible to working folk?  Middle school me would have agreed with you, but adult me does not.
---
Honestly that was a good troll. You got me convinced for a bit, you seemed genuinely concerned in the video.
---
He would love to. He loves teaching. Nothing makes him more proud than being able to lead people to success. I envy his mind.
---
Like all things destiny it is really just RNG. You have a chance to get one to drop from any kill in crucible and you have a chance for it to drop after every win. That's all there is to it. I did about 7 resets of crucible between Vigilance Wing Catalyst being added and it finally dropping. It's just the way it is.
---
I do, but as far as I'm aware it's due to bad spawns not a ridiculous super, spectral blades on the other hand
---
fuck. Almost there. Just need some sound chips, a couple speakers. Thats a whole nother world for me though... I dont even know where to begin on downloading a sound to a tiny circuit board, and having a pressure plate trigger and putting that all together.

---
I mean, we did get to use nova bombs as roaming supers.  So that's cool.
---
Sweet dildo bro!
---
Until next season when it gets reset lol
---
It takes longer to nerf spectral blades because it either needs a huge rework or serious changes, and that takes time
---
That statement is very questionable when they insta-nerfed Nova Warp and are handing out Gwisin via Xur which directly benefits Spectral Blades. I don't know if it's sheer incompetence or if it's intentional but something is fishy here.
---
They were buffed to the impossible duration and defense. Spectral didn‚Äôt start that way
---
My college sent me this laptop in order to learn how to use Unity and Unreal Engine. I'm.... okay so far. Hopefully i get my foot in the door as a QA guy at least.
---
any Last Man Standing with One Two Punch is all you need. The buff duration is about 1.5 seconds or something, only long enough for 1 melee hit. After I hit Legend in comp, pray it happens in a few days, I'm going to grind Reckoning and Gambit Prime for a LMS with Full Choke and 12Punch
---
Happens to me all the fkin time
---
Fuck that‚Äôs so hot. Thanks.
---
YOU FIEND
---
Unless you purchase it for $777,777.77 lmao bungee
---
We have controllers on pc my guy
---
Fight forever Guardian, fight forever, and Become Legend.
---
Hol up. Im confusion vanguard or naa?
---
I dig it.
---
Yes and no. She‚Äôs the path that led to him. And that‚Äôs something I‚Äôd never regret or want any other way. 
---
However it would be more fair to say, it‚Äôs a perfect example of how completely corrupt and broken America‚Äôs family court system is especially in the state I reside. 
---
In a honest and fair system he would have never had to deal with the things he has, and she wouldn‚Äôt have any types of advantages over me in a court room at trial. 
---
Being careful in anything is important. But family courts job is to above all protect my son, and make sure the best suitable everything is what he gets. Which is completely the opposite of what he was handed. Just like it‚Äôs impossible to be too careful in a destiny game mode yet if a broken system designed to force you to lose is in place, nothing will change the outcome until what‚Äôs allowing cheating is fixed.
---
Duuude that‚Äôs awesome recluse and Luna‚Äôs tomorrow then ü§ôü§ôüòÅüòÅüòÅ
---
Thorn is really easy. But I hate TLW from the deep of my soul, 3 god damn heroic witch rituals. Whyyyy
---
Mah gawd! What a big day! Congrats mate! :D
---
Yeah true, it‚Äôs always in favour of the women sadly. But I‚Äôm glad you find refuge in destiny.
---
Good luck man
---
Tbh Im speaking from the perspective of a Titan: Ursa and Oem are the only good for pvp, I wouldnt use any exotic over those. Look at Stronghold, Actium War Rig, Dunemarchers, Eternal Warrior, the Aeon gauntlets, and basically almost every other exotic. And the worst part is: oem and ursa are forsaken exotics, so you can grind way less activities than you can for y1
---
Alright alright alright...
---
# ALRIIIIIIIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
It‚Äôs obviously an invisible servitor
---
The first, big area of the Leviathan. The place with the banners.
---
I guess he was shocked a just didnt want anymore friend buried. And yes now that cayde is dead zavala and ikora are grieving not really caring or working fully and like he said we are guardians not conquers. But yeah i see why ppl choose drifter but 6 months of not knowing what to do, shocked, scared... does not change my loyalities. Vanguard will get better i know that. Or if ikora and zavala gets out i will not follow vanguard anymore.
---
Oh yay. Another $30 to access content that should be free for people who simply bought the game. Good thing Thorn is the only thing I want.
---
Same - I have 1 left that I visit every so often but never open
---
So do I!üòç
---
Smoke grenades are insane. They blind you, slow you, and any damage they deal is just extra nonsense. The slow will often kill you by making it impossible to escape any other grenade, and makes it much easier to shoot you. They're really strong before you factor in the gambler's dodge making them reliably faster to get than almost any other ability.
---
Yeah I never understood why throwing knives are so bad. A precision hit with sharpshooter knife should be an insta kill, because it's pretty damn hard to land compared to any other ability
---
Pretty much agreed. Only difference is I've complained a lot about DB but pretty much only about the crazy projectile tracking on attunement of flame.
---
 [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1cmhZs1P54) you go.
---
If my pc only ran at 60fps I'd not use it..
---
And that was nerfed... despite requiring the enemy actively interacting with the super, lol.
---
Although I don't think it was even that good in PvE pre nerf anyway.
---
It's Fallen fart
---
Recluse absolutely shreds in pve. So I'm using that there now. I tried using Luna's in pvp but it's kinda hard to get used to when you are used to the range and damage of ace, so it's on the back burner now
---
I've had bad luck with guided games, however that is as a guide with a fireteam of 5 with me. If you have a mic and are willing to communicate/participate you'll do better than the people I've been matched up with. Lol. LFG will be quicker for you tho, just use the Destiny 2 app fireteam search function.
---
I'd disagree. Titans weren't the best, but they were absolutely capable (and fun) for high level activities. Hammers were nice, but bubbles were an A tier super thanks to WoL and the nigh immunity it gave.
---
Striker wasn't for PvE, that was PvP. Although even that was pretty fun to use for strikes and the like. It wasn't a team super for sure, but was fun.
---
D2...no. Titans have melting point and the banner shield, and both of those are super mediocre compared to offering from the Well/Tether. Hammers are nice, but don't do enough damage and the striker tree....I absolutely hate striker in d2, beyond feeling unsatisfying it just sucks compared to sentinel or sunbreaker for everything.
---
*Didn't play a tonne of d1 due to reasons, but had about 300 hours and a few raids under my belt. D2, about 600 hours and *many* Leviathan runs under my belt as well as a decent bit of play outside of raids. Never enjoyed hunters or warlocks, titan jump's just so much nicer.
---
That's what I hear. And I'm on console I can't use ace to save my life in comp
---
*meanwhile in titan*
---
THIS IS AMAZING!!!
---
As of today
---
Xbox
---
Streamer privileges confirmed
---
Same here, I got reload mw and gg helps w/ reloading rn until I get feeding frenzy but almost all PvE rolls want rampage so you'll almost always want a rampage spec
---
I am inserting my opinion and thought process so others might see why I did what I did. Take it as they may.
---
Like big bags of sand?
---
I can never get over how big midnight coup actually is. Nice model.
---
Haha man I have 2 viewers at best but couldn‚Äôt believe this run of good luck, got skull as one of my powerful drops for 150k nightfall and the boss dropped nezracs, finished my izanagis burden quest and realised I had a machine gun frame, thought why not so I don‚Äôt lose it to reset and bam jotun dropped. Literally was joking with my clan mate on my stream how I have 45 bergusia forge ignitions and still no jotun and there you go. Good days luck

Am i the only strange fucker that likes Mercury?

Poor wording I suppose. I see why it's *a* benefit, I don't see why it's constantly talked about like it's OP, not when it's just a shotgun substitute that uses an exotic at best.

Holy damn, good job!
---
Lol I haven‚Äôt even unlocked izanami forge yet. Stuck on the insight terminus mission thing
---
I got this over the weekend.  It shreds in PVP and PVE.  It doesn't have the best range, and it's recoil can take getting used to, but it is a monster at close to mid range in crucible.  And when you get it's perk going I think it has the fastest TTK in PVP.  I had my first 30 kill PVP match with this weapon.
---
im waiting for the day that someone does the red card to me and i can respond with my protecting teammates emote.

interesting in your opinion what do you think was the best thing each pack has offered so far?

9/10 not enough recluse
---
I once got 2 exotics one after another.  I did a forge on my hunter and got a la monarque. then i swapped to my warlock, did a crucible match and got a two tailed fox.

The Izanami forge quest is longer than the ENTIRE war-mind campaign. Perspective is a wonderful thing.

You are my hero

This was my fire team trying to complete the thorn quest tbh

we need the failsafe ghost
---
The Drifter is a Lightbearer, but not only does he predate the Guardians, he actively avoided being conscripted into any Guardian style shenanigans. Lord Saladin is not a Guardian either, he's an Iron Lord (although technically they kind of became the Guardians). 
---
Drifter is planning on taking just his crew with him because after all the effort he put into an escape plan he wants people he can trust with him. He's been around for so long and gone through so much suffering that he's jaded and finds the Vanguard's "hope is the key, we will persevere" style response to threats silly. 
---
He killed his last crew because they were a bunch of paranoid dickheads who had it coming.
---
It was on the frontpage...
---
I queued up in a gambit match last night.  Match starts.  We bank quickly.  Get the first invasion portal.  I invade.  Get quickly sniped by a hunter.  Hunter runs over and t-bags me.  I am now motivated.  I invade and murder his team over and over again denying their motes.  My team summons our prime evil and burns it.  Round 2.  It happens again.  I murder their team.  I invade again.  T-Bagging guy is just sitting in a chair doing nothing.  They have 12 motes, we have 74.  We win round.  I PM t-bagging guy: "Better luck with the t-bags next time friend."
---
Moral:  Don't celebrate until you are the winner.

For... Lore reasons

Val Cau‚Äôour in spire of stars tbh (when it was new)

I had the same problem and found no solution for Destiny 2. Your phone provider blocks P2P data streams (which happen whenever you join pvp or pve when you aren't solo) and kicks you from the network. (In my case it was the 4G Free in France)
---
i forgot to mention this is all biowares fault EA is actually the good guy in this case since it was biowares decision to use frostbite and it was patrick soderlund who after playing a demo of anthem (after 6 years of waiting since bioware was scratching their arses trying to figure out what the game was going to be) with no flying said "what the fuck is this shit?" if it wasnt for ea anthem wouldnt have flying arguably the only good thing in the game
---
Excuse me, 60 fps? Try 144fps with 4K.....typical console noob doesn‚Äôt even know

Yeah, that's exactly what happened; but thanks for the correction (genuinely). 20% is high enough that I can see myself being salty if it didn't drop.

Thought about posting this earlier, how I feel while playing comp:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGQx37dwnhM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGQx37dwnhM)

I‚Äôll be that way if I don‚Äôt get the DC ghost in the next couple weeks.

I hope so. That‚Äôs always the goal though.
---
I want it.
---
I feel the same my friend, I have played with some nice people and in a great clan.
---
First time I've been in a clan and they have been so helpful and kind.
---
Not found a game with a great community like this.
---
I have played with some sour people over the years in other games, but I but this has been the most fun I've had in years playing a game.
---
I can when I get home later üôÇ
---
Im sorry chief thats kinda ugly
---
Bottom tree is just straight up better
---
It‚Äôs not showing up in my collections in the app though. Maybe I need to sign in to the actual game first
---
Agreed, the combination of its unique exotics perks and rampage just make it a perfect SMG. The SMG that actually deserved to be called Exotic. Another one is Ace of Spades, Fire Flies and Momento Mori is a perfect perks for hand cannon.
---
The game is great fun. I'm a half-assed solo player (I still have not finished either Last Wish or Scourage and haven't even attempted the other raids, but I'm way more invested in D2 than I was in D1. 
---
While Bungie is still fighting me about matchmaking, they've done a great job putting tools like the fireteam finder into their app (which has made it much easier for me to find parties), and they've put together a good amount of content for endgame players that don't want to spam raids (Shattered Throne, Whisper, Forge content, Reckoning, some of the exotic hand cannon quests, etc.). 
---
I'm really enjoying Destiny becoming the world that even if I don't have anything specific to do, I'll come home and hang out for a while.

I mean that shit is op though

I'm not actually sure about this one, I never notice if I ever get those, cuz I'm staring at my heavy ammo hoping taken armaments gives me free rockets and probably dying to the wave lol. I'd bet on it, though.

Join the hunter side, we have **capes.**
---
Well I guess I'll have to see which curated I get because I really want I outlast.
---
Nah fuck that it's good right where it's at grow some balls I mean literally the other day I ran straight at a guy with it and all the volleys missed so if anything it needs a buff
---
Did the do the xur thing or did it actually drop for you
---
I'm not asking for a nerf if you read  it again.
---
lmao nice dodge
---
Not sure if you have any Pinnacle PVP weapons. If you don't, and think you're gonna be able to get them solo, I'm sorry but your chances are next to zero, at least with this matchmaking system.
---
I'm not a huge PVP person, don't really care enough to put a team together and actually try.
---
I've accepted the fate that many solo players have. I'm never getting a Pinnacle PVP weapon. Not as long as it requires Comp.
---
I honestly no longer care about weapons like Luna and Recluse. As long as I don't have to touch Comp, I'm happy.
---
You do realize in against the nerf right? Read again.
---
I know this is gonna sound stupid but what exactly is the point of forging these weapons? Higher power lvl? Forgive my ignorance
---
That one is tied to the Reckoning, you get it as a drop from the Oryx guy, unfortunately not from gambit prime. From killing blockers and invaders you'll get Last Man Standing.
---
Saw someone else today with infinite Oxygen sr3's. Hmmmmm
---
Ok I guess I'm going off to kill Oryx tomorrow.
---
Man I picked a bad time to finally finish the bounty
---
I mean, most of the people complaining are casual players who barely played D1
---
Stealing?
---
Go ahead and DV me, but having Luna‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt suddenly make you a badass....the gun (while being a good gun) only shines if a player can consistently hit their head shots; basically good players will be good with Luna‚Äôs, whereas not good players are better off using a Trust (on console).
---
It needs to be a high curse week for the portal to open.

Did you try restarting your game? Maybe it's an inventory space issue.
---
lol no its not
---
Lol yea, I‚Äôm working on my broadsword quest rn, I just need 2 more resets lol
---
Jeez ya'll it was just a joke... I should have wrote spectral blades...
---
lol, getting Luna‚Äôs has never been easier. Must suck to have to pay for it....or even worse, not being able to get it without paying for it, making a player think everyone with Luna‚Äôs paid for it
---
Lol what the shit. Thanks though, how do I know when's the next one ?

Sure! What platform do you play on? I play on Xbox

Try switching characters then go back
---
I definitely pulled my weight but I never did a single raid or even nightfall in D1 because I had nobody to play with.  Thank god for guided games. I would have happily given it to one of my guides if that were possible.
---
There was a glitch that let you get infinite cores and stuff from it. They hotfixed it in a few hours. So yeah.
---
Sorry, pleb, Luna‚Äôs is far from broken. I‚Äôm willing to bet if you had it, you‚Äôd still be shit
---
Happens often, what i did was switch characters, if you only have one character.  You can log back in as well, but switching characters is the fastest
---
A wrongful stereotype? Nice one buddy.. 
---
Guess what? I have the gun and I wreck people with it, and I think that‚Äôs op as hell. And if you‚Äôre using Luna‚Äôs in someone‚Äôs face, then you would absolutely get blasted by Dust Rock no doubt.
---
I restarted and now the reward screen won't show up :(
---
Since no one‚Äôs given a straight answer, no, it does not have a frame. The only place you can get Threat Level is from the Scourge of the Past raid.
---
They werent playing all weekend, they have insider info, or they just slept on it. Idk. Idc. Im just salty.
---
Nightfall or strike?
---
They brought TL quest back for arc week brah
---
that's the thunderlord quest, it's for people who don't have thunderlord for Arc Week.
---
Finally IO again so I can get wayfarer
---
No idea, they probably have done it every week hoping something would glitch for them
---
Oh cool, wish they wouldnt confuse me and give it to me even tho i have tlord though.,. Ill get rid of this post lol
---
I'm on PC
---
wait are the architects canon? are they in the lore?
---
Hey man btw do u got discord?
---
From engrams
---
Dang
---
Sure do, Vysoft#4887
---
Pulse Rifle, Bow, Machine Gun, Sniper Rifle, Hand Cannon, Sword, and Auto Rifle
---
Wait how did you do this
---
Only floors should cause speed based damage. Change my mind.
---
 I got it by accident grinding for lunas howlüòÇ
---
I forgot we lived in a world where Destiny 2 was also on consoles, sorry. And honestly, I hate LFG. If I can't get someone in my clan to do a thing with me I just don't run it. Almost all my LFG experiences are people who have absolutely no clue and don't put that up front, or people who act like D2 is their full time profession and are passive aggressive at best the second you make one mistake.
---
No special rewards for doing it a second time
---
Hey, I like Mercury...
---
did you claim the triumph
---
Bungie fucked the game up with the update, people started getting 100s of infusion cores by reclaiming pinnacle weapons and deleting them. They've now disabled all pinnacle weapons. 
---
Fun huh
---
Holy crap pc recoil is so much better
---
I mean it has the season 3 ornament so it's impossible even if faction rallies did come back.
---
Problem solved. Just needs to reboot the xbone and it updated.  Good to go.
---
Ah alright thank you so much
---
Recoil compensation is much easier, is smg recoil really that bad on console?
---
I recently got a hammerhead with tap the trigger/ rampage with stability masterwork. It‚Äôs so filthy
---
Claiming unlimited copies of a pinnacle weapon and get essentially unlimited cores, shards, parts.
---
perfect timing -.- 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
what was the exploit about? never even heard of it
---
An ARC Lance super would be pretty cool I guess. Not too dissimilar to dawnblade though.
---
Why do you save notorious engrams?
---
YOUR ALMOST THERE YOU CAN DO IT!!
---
Now that I think about it, probably closer to 15 seconds
---
doing the walking part on the starts made me almost buy the 3k silver to skip it
---
It's not new, it's just DFA with a longer barrel.
---
Even if you already completed it during Festival of the Lost? I'd like to go back..
---
My week is ruined
---
I blame halo for teabaggers and showboaters.
---
F
---
That's why i think it's both
---
Someone should have told you about the Penumbra GSM ;)
---
can it drop when the "Powerful Gear" is not showing?
---
Go to the tower then orbit then tower. Or switch characters and switch back. This seems to work for most people
---
Nope, 3 chances a week
---
Okay, fucking Titan whips out an arc lance fate style. Charging forward before releasing a massive lightning bolt from where the lance landed.
---
It requires about as much time to remake D1 areas as it does to make new areas. So would you (and the rest of the community) prefer new or old areas? Can‚Äôt have both
---
I've heard the rumours, but considering it can't take mods and it isn't void, I would say it isn't as efficient when under actual DPS conditions. Similar to how 1KV (which has the highest DPS against Riven when unbuffed) got shit on by my Transit during the tests.
---
But hey, you never know until you test it right? I'll be right on it.
---
The app doesn‚Äôt show what shader or orniment is on the weapon
