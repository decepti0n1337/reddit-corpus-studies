---
Laughed too much to this tbh xD
---
Am I the only one excited to cruise around on the moan in a boat? Tiny sparrow is meme-worthy but the boat sparrow is a great design with an amazing finished look. And I really look forward to seeing the previews of it in all my shaders.
---
Titan because space middle ages
---
im not so sure they could nerf them as hard as they nerfed luna.  luna is incredibly horrendous on pc now (not that i know what it was like pre nerf but it is borderline unusable in its current state).  they would have to make some drastic changes to mt and recluse to put them in that same state.  
---

---
regardless, a nerf is probably coming sooner or later for both those weapons.
---
It‚Äôs on my skull of dire ahamkara, helps with the nerf.
---
Not really you just get emblems and triumphs for quick play, the wins do count towards a recluse triumph ‚Äúthe stuff of myth‚Äù and iron banner matches boosts it even further faster than normal crucible ones
---
Nice, what shotgun is that? Also noticed some mad stow and equip speeds on those weapons.
---
Oh boy, finish the quest.
---
Also you can go into shaders and delete one and it brings you back into the game.
---
Mine was trying to get Lumina and I had to get a hand cannon kill or whatever in pvp. I was upset as I had gotten SO DAMN CLOSE multiple times and finally a new team would invade and just let people kill them for it. I was so happy.
---
(I am not a pvp player. I suck at it and it pisses me off quick)
---
Chode sparrow
---
Ah okay thanks
---
Because you didn't read...
---
Yes
---
We ran the nightfall after that just for shits and giggles cause...I mean...we got it so we might as well use it! The amount of add clears you can do with three outbreaks is utterly beautiful. Nobody stood a chance
---
You can do it the first time tryna get fabled seems so far but once you get there any other weapons that require you to get to fabled are easy
---
Thanks!!
---
For me, it's Outbreak Perfected, hands down. Non exotic, I love my Go Figure with ricochet rounds and rampage.
---
Whatever you want.
---
I have the legendary Go Figure and find that really good. Not sure if there is a better pulse rifle out there, but that one certainly works great for me.
---
I‚Äôll try it out when I get off work grinded for it last night till 3 in the morning once I got it I KOed
---
It‚Äôs on my skull of dire ahamkara, so it helps with the nerf.
---
Good idea for a Evereverse Ornament. Haha Everytime he gets a over shield the music plays.
---
The three best non exotic pulses in game currently are Blast Furnace, Go Figure, and Bygones.
---
Titan and warlock are just broken in general their supers last forever compared to a hunter super
---
Remove "no one" and you got yourself a decent meme
---
Ur right sorry
---
No problem, best of luck to you.  I'm on that same step right now on my Hunter and its probably going to take a lot longer.  Melee and Super kills at 90% or higher but the Grenade kills is at 26%.
---
lmao same, it had me rolling
---
Sorry I was a slightly absentminded with the response and was thinking a bit of pve. Anyways just use a sniper or something that doesn‚Äôt leave you 10 feet away. And lord of wolves can‚Äôt one burst your super if it‚Äôs something like nova bomb or blade barrage. So that‚Äôs a counter. Range is always a counter because while lord of wolves may be longer range than any shotgun, it‚Äôs still a shotgun. And it is a exotic. It‚Äôs supposed to be good
---
this is their opportunity lol
---
YO DAWG I HEARD YOU LIKE DEFEATING ENEMIES
---
&gt; And it is a exotic. It‚Äôs supposed to be good
---
I agree, exotics should be good, but they shouldn't be THIS good. The weapon is busted. It's effective range is far beyond that of any other shotgun. The thing can always one shot you. 
---
Sniping is a counter, but as I said, if a team of OEM Titans come bum rushing you how on earth are you supposed to counter that shit?
---
Have you played crucible at all recently?
---
Grenades
---
Enhanced rocket launcher loader.    
---
***looks at Truth***

Nah....

Little Tikes: My First Sparrow
---
Very true! There is supposed to be a fix coming to roaming supers soon!
---
Oh and also went on a spending spree at Tess
---
Lucky I‚Äôd be grinding still but I‚Äôm GMT and it‚Äôs 1am good luck to you
---
Well, at least they tried.
---
Jotunn is so easy to counter though
---
I‚Äôve literally been killed by a titan, respawn across the map and get killed by the same guy still with his super. He killed 7 people in a row. It‚Äôs broken
---
Worse thing is seeing 6 of this fellas on the enemy team on a Iron banana match.
---
I‚Äôm fine with it in everything except mayhem, in mayhem it just ruins the fun for everyone especially the other team, in normal crucible it‚Äôs ok because it only affects a certain area unlike roaming supers
---
G R E N A D E S
---
Pretty much.
---
üòÇüòÇ I've seen alot of grenades this time around. Last mo th was horrible though! Haha
---
*looks at my cleared out bright dust from tribute hall*
---
Fuck
---
üò¢
---
No, they are walking Tractor Cannons, too. Love playing Shuro Chi with a Titan. Lightspeed ad-clearing combined with the Hammer Strike debuff is pretty useful.
---
I mean given that it's based on traditional samauri dress it kinda makes sense...
---
https://youtu.be/NcKGw-IO5Uc
---
Then make it longer... the short stub just looks so strange in this game. Id love to see a long pony tail like a Sekiro hair look
---
Lord Shaxx does t have balls. He has *G R E N A D E S.*
---
I'm max light and I haven't even done a raid
---
As of now, eververse. The e.p. armor will most likely be reaquired.
---
This is to relatable
---
I havent played destiny in a while im on ryzen 3000, what happened
---
Ironically, this makes me more excited for what we'll see in Shadowkeep.
---
I'm getting d1 y3 MoT feels from this armour.
---
That'd probably be an improvement. I don't like the set personally. Too much gold
---
My wallet is tingling. Oh god no.
---
Gotta catch em all
---
Thank you
---
I would pay a LOT of money for a Patrick Warburton ghost voice.
---
sorry, do you know a power leveling way, for solo bc mu friends rn are not onto their 3rd characters
---
cool, but disappointed since its shotgun gameplay!
---
Same
---
Love your stuff
---
Yes, it's called the tribute hall. Not sure when you can access it since I was already done with all the story line when they put it in the game so it just showed up
---
So even if I buy the disc it will still transfer?
---
Well ya have you never bought dlc on a game before?
---
No, garbage is me using both and still losing.
---
And! I FEEL that the removal of my post was not right! It was a discussion that I wanted to have! For them to remove it because they FELT it was duplicate content is not cool! Everything on this reddit is duplicate content!  Someone just asked about the OPness of lord is he getting his post removed!?
---
Yes there is a trophy room but you need to have the annual pass and forsaken dlc
---
The Tribute Hall is acquired by owning the Annual Pass. It can be found next to the Menagerie icon in the orbit of Nessus. (Orbit of Nessus is where the Leviathan raids are found)
---
Happy cake day!
---
Look up how to get bad juju and it‚Äôs all the info you‚Äôll probably need

You are obviously part of the problem!  So why haven't they removed any of the new post!? They all contain duplicate content!

Same. Solo grinding seems to be the only way to do it. Can't find a good team to save my life.
---
This is out of line DMing you personally. I don't know the whole story but if he had to DM you he should have done it better. No matter how infuriating the person is you have to keep your cool and be professional.
---
You don‚Äôt need annual pass or foresaken. If you needed those why would the mission be 300 light. And I did it with a friend that didn‚Äôt have foresaken.
---
my apologies. very late here. will edit
---
I DMed him to ask why he removed it. This was the answer.

This is the second engram that I'd be unlocking tonight, first one went through no problem. Engram emblem is grayed out and clicking on it has no effect. This one is significantly above my power level as I'm sitting at 280 at the moment, not sure if that's why I'm unable to unlock. Are there requirements that I'm not aware of? I've googled around but I don't see anything that could explain why I'm unable to collect the engram.
---
Godly

While I agree that you are also out of line, he should have been more professional and respected the image of what a moderator should be.

I'm not a part of the problem. You are by spamming this sub. They can't sit here and get everything. But you are obnoxious about this. 3 fucking posts in 30 minutes.  Get off the sub dude.
---
You don‚Äôt have any gunsmith materials to turn in it looks like. Am I missing something?
---
That‚Äôs funny right there
---
Simple fix but still needs to be patched it's silly
---
what does traction do?
---
So much for a random nice guy!
---
Thanks for welcoming a fellow guardian trying to express his feelings.
---
lol reddit.
---
Nah man you just gotta find your play style
---
i personally didn‚Äôt really like the Nessus dialogue at the end, but the rest was perfect! outstanding job dude/dudette!
---
But did you defeat the enemies ? Well..... did you ?
---
Peregrine Greaves is the only exotic I don‚Äôt have.
---
Last 2 exotic drops have been Peacekeepers and Mk 44 Stand Asides.

This game is fucking trolling me.

This looks like Kirby inhaled the guy off dead space! Looks great!

Ah, i haven't seen anything about it so i figured I'd post something. Good they need to

You can have up to 530 weapons at once, but you can only carry 10 with you per slot (kinetic, energy, heavy). The other 500 can be stored in your vault. You have access to this vault in the farm, and in the tower once you finish the Red War campaign.
---
Year 1 weapons can be safely dismantled and brought back from the Collections tab in your inventory, but Year 2 weapons can't (because they have randomly rolled perks). For this reason, if you are running low on weapon slots, you should keep weapons which you don't use often (but don't want to dismantle) in the vault.
---
Everyone has their own private vault and no one other than you has access to the items you put there yourself.
---
You can‚Äôt quote the rules if you didn‚Äôt read them. #2 says YouTube videos are fine.

Warning of some vulgar language used by people in the video. Just some fun clips I got during the first day of Iron Banner. I'm particularly proud of one of my transitions.

I am on console, but I find the chaperone does alright against the Lord of Wolves

I don‚Äôt really like to ape to be honest I just like to counter the ones aping, so I was thinking something with QuickDraw and a lot of range.

Nightshade.

i think i played with that person before
---
They all look so good.
---
The feels only thing I e needed for like 2 weeks lol
---
I've got 19k bright dust, I hope that's enough for all 3 sets.  I assume we have to earn the armor through challenges then buy the glowy parts from tess?
---
Well that sucks. Oh well, thanks for answering
---
Joined. Will try and make some content.
---
Yes but actually no.
---
Imagine using jotun lol
---
Agreed. Keep one of each, at least if they look promising. However, no sense in keeping things that give you increased reload while crouching if you know you will never crouch.
---
And then there are those items which you just do not like and do not feel comfortable with. Does not matter what becomes meta, if it just does not feel right.
---
I'm just salty about the fact that kepri's sting wasn't brought back as it was in D1. All I'm sayin' is that it'd be nice if my hunter could use his melee to kill a super like my titan could...
---
Titan set reminds me a little of the ornamented trials armour from D1 üòç
---
Yes yes yes

You lucky fecker. I've been on the last part of the sturm quest for about a month, still ain't got an exotic to drop :(
---
It mercy ruled me at 17 to 76 (my team lost)
---
Hopefully before shadow keep
---
Seriously I've seen this like 3 times now
---
Legit got that from last wish yesterday
---
Try it against invaders or as an invader its really fucking good
---
You can get them as random drops from salidin or bounties
---
repost alert!
---
the crown above the nighthawk's head looks badass, I wish (no pun intended) you could have it at all times...
---
Yo I miss those old D1 3 man dark souls runs.
---
Its on sale I think for like half off right now too! I got it only a few weeks back and have done crown twice now which has been fun
---
And we *liked* it!
---
I got astrocyte verse when I wanted getaway artist. It was very saddening.
---
fair play - I have no idea why folks downvoted you - all you did was give your loadout and show how successful youve been with it (I didnt down vote btw), but the salt is real within these folks
---
Defeat enemies
---
Nope, it's literally irrelevant because you can have high sens and turn instantly by flicking your mouse. Some players even feel like Traction hurts their gameplay because it messes with their muscle memory slightly.
---
Even if i see an enemy bag another enemy that wasn't a douche i will go out of my way to bag the killer
---
The only thing I would add is the Guardian saying "Uldren Sov is mine" before the last action montage :D
---
Sometimes I feel bungie had the intern write these things. Especially for the "A Garden World" strike. Half the time it just says "Ascend".
---
#SquadGoal
---
Smh, lost 4 motes not good enough
---
Friday's at reset Xur appears at a random location (you can check on here to see where he is and what he as each week).  He is only available Friday to Monday.  
---
He sells one weapon and one armor piece for each character type.  He also has a fated engram that you can get.  The fated engram is guaranteed to give you a Y1 random drop exotic (they may have added Forsaken exotics also) that your character does not have already.  Make sure you buy anything he has that you need prior to getting the fated engram.  If you need a weapon you can buy the fated engram on any character and have a chance at that, but if you need Crown of Tempest for your warlock, make sure you purchase the engram on your warlock for a chance at it.  The loot pool is only those random drop exotics that your character does not have.
---
The items he sales are usually around 27 shards, the fated engram is 97 shards.
---
To actually answer your question: Aggressive frames are far more competitive than rapid fire frames in the current meta. Aggressive frame has a significantly longer OHK range than rapid fire frames. The rapid fire frames‚Äô main advantage used to be two-tapping people at pretty long distances, but Bungie nerfed their fire rate severely a few months back so they‚Äôre not good for much in PvP anymore.
---
But truth is faster, hast 3 in the chamber and has proximity rockets. 
---
So its superior in any way! But I'll give it a shot or two :)
---
Finally managed to use the hug emote time hug someone on the enemy team in comp yesterday. Best moment I‚Äôve had in D2
---
Yah i know. I have a video if you want it  but he spawned near me and i blew him up with a rocket launcher. Same thing happened the next round except i used rose and a grenade. Killed him less than 10 secs. I think the check mark isnt showing because i have generated 50 orbs yet or got the number of final blows in Crucible yet. But after i get that done i really hope that Pursuit is done because this grind for Lumina is killing me. I even have an ornament for lumina (which i wont put it on, the thorns get removed üòû)Its been 2 days. God
---
Thank you I meant archon
---
i have no idea how it would work either
---
Ive already gotten the Medal before. Does it have to Re pop up or.??
---
I would be the warlock with the self resurrection to keep us from getting sent back
---
fuck this is a great analogy, lmao this is how I ended up with 21% Delirium and Breakneck lol I started playing and never stopped lol
---
This is true. It was like Omaha Beach D-day before. Now I did Savathuns Song a couple days ago like My wife and I are damn Seal Team 6 knocking down everything.
---
Well yeah. That way more people will spend money in the eververse store. Just another way bungie want to rape your wallet after charging ¬£140 for the full game! Yay!

Got our pickaxe swinging from side to side, side side to side....

This looks really awesome, chills man for real. Keep up the good work, this is obviously your passion.
---
I remember doing the Valus nightfall in D1 and my fireteam would run out of ammo hiding under the stairs, so one member would go to orbit and rejoin to get ammo again.

2 maybe 3.  I always take a good 10-15 min break after I hit 2-3 losses.  Come back refreshed and focused.

I think what would‚Äôve been better for ‚ÄúEvery Titan, Every Warlock...‚Äù would be the Taken King subclass scenes. Other than that, I absolutely loved it and would preorder tickets if I could.

The quest you did to enter the menagerie was supposed to explain it. When you enter the menagerie without a rune in your chalice, there's also a text prompt telling you to put runes in your chalice to get loot. 
---
To open the chest at the end, you must have at least one rune in your chalice. There are a wide variety of charts and guides showing what combinations of runes lead to each item. [This is the one that I use.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/by1a21/i_made_simple_chalice_of_opulence_combination/)

Considering how small most of the maps are, I‚Äôm afraid buffing primaries while keeping shotguns as they‚Äôre will fix the issue. I‚Äôm not saying that shotguns shouldn‚Äôt deal fatal damage in close range, all I‚Äôm saying is a Dust Rock shotgun shouldn‚Äôt deal that fatal damage in mid range. 
---
Shotguns should remain king in close range, but they shouldn‚Äôt kill a full hp Guardian outside of that. Not to mention that shotguns being so strong is what made most other weapon types irrelevant in the first place, especially Auto rifles.
---
Out of curiosity, what's the range on that thing? Successfully managed to backpaddle from it earlier more often than I expected.
---
How is he toxic and trash if he uses weapons that he is good with then why would he not use them and put himself at a disadvantage
---
Same but even when I came back I got matched with trash teammates
---
Pulse nade Titan would disagree and idk if handheld Nova is melee or grenade but if it's the latter then they disagree as well.
---
Shin's motives are still questionable at best. We know he's Dredgen Vale. We know he's tempting guardians to the dark side, similar to Drifter, but disposing of any who tread too far into it. We know he and his followers have access to the ammunition required to snuff out light. What we don't know is his motivation for being involved in Cayde's death, if he was. The prevailing hypothesis last I checked was that it would serve as a push to The Guardian (the most powerful guardian the system has seen so far, at least by feats) to stray towards the darkness enough to straddle the line and embrace both dark and light.
---
It's all primarily conjecture at this point, but the timing of the reveal that Shin isn't exactly the pure "good guy" we thought he was seems a little like it's pushing to at least get people to think he may have had some involvement.
---
Exotic quests are only going to be a single piece of powerful gear.  Go to your director and do anything with a yellow circle tagged on its location.  Based on the distribution of your armor‚Äôs power, you should do them in different orders:  if your armor is all really close in power (within 1 or 2 of each other) do weekly powerful first.  If they‚Äôre spread way out, do dailies in hopes of replacing the low ones.  
---
If you‚Äôre not looking for powerlevel grind, pinnacle weapons are never a bad idea...  crucible pinnacle this season is slightly easier to earn.
---
Eververse bounty notes.. I‚Äôm sitting on 300 of them. Might have to start buying bounties with them now for bright dust. Haha
---
LOOK GARY THATS ME! üëÄ

This is the first time I‚Äôve ever seen these used effectively!  Thank you for showing me this!
---
I have like 1 rn cuz I've been doing them
---
Being thrown back to Orbit was brutal!
---
They fix the bug where you just kill yourself with them yet?
---
The scheduled fix was delayed unfortunately. It was packaged with the bios update that was pulled almost a week ago. When the bios updates are cleared for release they'll work with D2.
---
Sums the flawless raid experience up
---
Is it a worm God?
---
They basically push a romance subplot with one character and the MC for most of the series, then they pull a 180 and end up making the MC confess his love for a giant alien flesh mecha clone of a dead girl he had a crush on. Then later on it they go to a solar system to colonize it, and say it's gonna be a massive fight, and then they'll have to worry about an invasion afterwards. Well they go through the big massive fight, and then somehow comepletely skip the invasion bit and show them already having colonized the planet five years later. The MC has a kid with this giant flesh mecha, who apparently now has more of a clone human body of the dead girl he knew, then meets up with the side character with the romance subplot, and apparently they've now hooked up with another side character who is suddenly MALE (which is completely out of left field because for 99.999% of the comic they were female and never even showed any signs of possibility of becoming male).
---
they are clean up kills not one hits
---
Kinda reminds me of those trick guns that shoot out the little flag that says bang. Sweet piece though
---
I just play range game the entire time. Black Scorpion keeps me warm at night.
---
Thanks &lt;3 also a cool perspective
---
Yeah I just had a Bios update last week
---
Is it really 1600 for one?
---
I'm a really bad PvP player. I finally got to Brave I on my own so I was rather proud of myself. Then lost everything, now I'm sitting at 0 glory and haven't won since. So about 20 matches?
---
So you bought shadowkeep but not the annual pass? You‚Äôre missing out dude.
---
It's a little bit overkill, you'd notice it more at 265 fps. It makes a bit of a difference at 144 fps too, isn't noticeable at 60fps and does nothing at 30fps. You're literally speeding it up by the frame at this point. Also in activities like crucible you'll be subject to ping variation which could dampen its usefulness as well.
---
Maybe .....laughs maniacally
---
Not to be THAT guy but it kinda sounds like they ran out of ideas so they skipped the interesting parts, kinda like GoT they ran out of reference material
---
Wait is it going to be like those revelry ornaments or are they permanent
---
Of course, if you jumped up on the disc on the ceiling you had a better shot... And more ways to blow yourself up. Lol
---
So how would you go about keeping the identity and use of this exotic without completely neutering it? Also this is nothing at all compared to the felwinter/thorn/last word meta.
---
people always complain about how OP the frisbee is but this video pretty much sums up what happens when i try to use it.
---
Ignore him bro, he really is just one of the toxic people in the community. He does this to everyone even if it's destiny related.

That still doesn't make a lick of sense, but okay.  I was able to look up your account just fine on Bungie.net.
---
1. ok, so why did you say "Look at this engram I decrypted". In English, when you say "I" you are referring to yourself, indicating that you are talking about something YOU did.
---
2. OK? 
---
3. LOL if you knew anything about me, I report every meme as "spam" in this sub. The mods hate me. I prefer good quality dicussion about the game. not "hur dur, look at this gun thats not even mine that has 1 similarity to our destiny guns hur dur".
---
[deleted]
---
Yeah that would've been really cool. Also I kinda wish we had to work to get out light back. Or maybe once we get in back from the shard we have to do train again to use our powers right. Idk something. We kill a few fallen and voila it's all good yay.
---
I'm still on that grind. It's the only thing I need for my Wayfarer title. I wish they would make them strike specific loot like in D1 instead of Nightfall specific
---
Im sure there will be a eververse set and a earnable set just like the revelry
---
Oh damn.  I need that now.  Really hope it comes back.
---
Happy birthday!  You‚Äôll love this book.  
---
Also, as a side note; you‚Äôll suddenly become supremely aware of everyone‚Äôs complete and utter lack of Destiny lore knowledge.  Hold onto that k-power for as long as you can.
---
How do you know a loremaster when you meet one?  They‚Äôll tell you.
---
I find nothing more satisfying than tractor cannoning someone and hearing the meow
---
I'll just pass straight through motherfuckers. Not around, directly through.

I found my new Gambit loadout it's arbalest, recluse, a heavy of your choice (I like 21%) and full reaper set it's great
---
Last Perdition or Swift Ride XE if you need something for the energy slot

Check my comment history. When I find good questions or good posts that I feel are actually worthy of being posted, I am very kind and helpful. The reason it seems this way to you is (in my opinion) 99% of the "content" posted on the internet is trash and isn't worth clogging a forum with.
---
That is my opinion and I feel that I am allowed to share it. I am not being insulting, I am simply sharing my opinion about low effort or low quality posts. People can downvote all the want if they disagree.
---
I like that too
---
This is actually true. I do a lot better in comp than in quickplay. QP tends to have a lot more people using cheese and playing like their lives depend on it and comp tends to be a bit more laid back in my experience. Weird because i thought i would absolutely hate 4v4 because because it would be full of tryhards but it's the other way round. Maximum respect for the chill comp community, much prefer it to QP.
---
yeh marcus ren is quite the character. on a somewhat unreleated topic id recommend reading this https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/ghost-community-theater-presents
---
Ya, a Duke.   Boo....
---
Just think about it
---
FWIW, once we recorded a score of 249K, it dropped shortly after that. It‚Äôs a pain in the butt but keep grinding. It‚Äôs worth it when it drops!
---
If you want an even better feeling, you should go two man a raid boss. Feels great. Start with Argos.
---
Throw a grenade then walk backwards while they try to rush you, should be an easy kill and  don‚Äôt get impatient because they will try to bait you to walk around the corner.
---
However, the og post was just the pic, I added stuff to it, making it my own post.
---
No, there are too many.
---
Should stop throwing around the word cancer kid. It's a serious thing that shouldn't be used to describe a silly video game
---
Ghost ghost ! Man he was awesome
---
This actually makes me think about something I probably shouldn't, what would a suicidal guardian do?
---
I dont know how the revelry ornaments worked
---
Plus it's gonna be Armor 2.0 compatible.
---
Spectral has the best neutral for pvp in the entire game I don‚Äôt know what your on about. On console where I play hunters are extremely hard to track where it isn‚Äôt as much of a problem on PC. I do play hunter and I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I got the kill on someone just because I jumped over them and they having no clue where the fuck I am. I hardly see anyone use blink on console it‚Äôs just all hunters in comp, You are playing the victim card so hard here when you have the best neutral in all of pvp it‚Äôs really ironic
---
So... Whats your loadout eh?
---
There is a lot nicer way of going about it though you know? I have seen (few) posts of you being a good guy. Take that into consideration when you are not happy with the subject at hand. I don't think this was a necessary post, but he wanted to share. All you had to say was "This doesn't really follow the guidelines of the sub" then report it if that's how you felt you know? You are a smart guy, stop being mean (I am mean sometimes too and should work on that as well).
---
God yeah, that was a pain in the ass, wasn‚Äôt there a spot where you could stand on top of a door or something? Or was it staying on the wall prevented the mortar from hitting you?
---
In destiny 2?
---
You can still cheese raids? Man I miss the old Crotas end days.
---
Right, because if there is one thing I hear about Destiny 2 every single damn day its "Damn that is one ugly looking game!"
---
Oh wait......
---
I‚Äôm praying to the RNG gods, may they be merciful to you! Good luck!

---
Hey there!
---
We are a small group of both new &amp; returning players. We just started a new clan and would like for you to join us on our adventures! If you ask me this is the perfect opportunity to join a clan and get close with everybody, which hopefully would lead to good friendships! :D
---
What are we looking for?
---
First of all we are looking for nice &amp; awesome people to play with! but also active players.
---
We are also looking for people that want's to do raids, Nightfall, Crucible etc. (Note: As of now we are all still getting our Light level to 740, to do raids).
---
So if you are looking for some to do weekly, daily or other activities with, we would be more than happy for you to join us!
---
For now it's just casual. but we probably will do some hardcore raiding &amp; such later on.
---
If you would like to join, please post a comment down below with a little bit of info about what your max light level is and such, maybe also something about yourself if you want :)
---
P.S: a microphone would be a good thing to have!
---
Alternatively you can join our Discord, and we will take things from there!: https://discord.gg/nBNbpa
---
also if im reading it correctly marcus is playing our ghost and his ghost is playing us
---
Yup.
---
I took your advice and got a monitor instead of a TV, I opted for an Ultra HD Samsung that was $100 off today so I only paid about the same as the other 1080 models, and I didn't even know my Xbox One X could do this! It's so smooth and the contrast of the colors is insane! Everything is so much sharper than my 4K TV probably because there are more pixels per inch, but it's crazy! I also have Astros with digital surround sound and while I was messing with the Xbox video settings, I realized I can output Dolby audio through the optical cable aswell! So the sound is way clearer and I loaded into the tower, and I'm hearing sounds I've never heard before, like bugs/rodents scurrying around, footsteps sound wayyy better, and everything is overall amazing. About to try it out in iron banner :)

That‚Äôs dirty

Reddit.

Boop
---
Sometimes you need to search for answers...never stop learning
---
Id buy it. I love creepy shit like this
---
That's the ghost shell you need because guiding light will help you get the shitty "Best of Year One" engrams faster and you junk all the stuff they drop
---
Tbh Mercury past is my all time fav location
---
I actually use pandora to listen to other game soundtracks - halo, D1, assassins creed. Surprisingly it makes the game feel different and not so repetitive.
---
That's my point. A game with that much content should have basic hints somewhere. They're allowing many parts of their game to be overlooked.
---
No man‚Äôs sky looks great
---
Warlock because space magic n' shit.
---
On a serious note though, i just love everything about warlocks. I love the cosmetics, the abilities, the lore ect and i think ikora is actually a badass and the best remaining vanguard. I love warlock players too and am very proud to be one. We look fabulous, we've got fun abilities and we've got a great mentor in ikora. 
---
I love titans and hunters too but for me warlocks are the most fun to play and I've been drawn to them ever since the D1 beta. Respect to all the warlock OG's and warlock mains out there, you're all amazing.
---
Also, infinite grenades and rift ftw!
---
And all your ammo synths
---
wow thats annoying i work every day except wed and thursday perfect.
---
You think that MMOs and online game use your console as their server and you just wiped out your character, either Destiny is your first video game or you're not that intelligent of a person.
---
no, the "enhanced" versions as i said are just "normal" and dont say slightly.
---
i know but it wont not even on microsoft website

Lore tabs from D1 can‚Äôt remember exactly which ones. He was the first person to use his powers to defend humanity, it never says he was the first to be risen but it‚Äôs heavily implied and no other tab or book ever talks about a first guardian unless it‚Äôs referencing Rezyl
---
Relax, it's a joke.. lol
---
Thanks a lot mate, great explanation. I think i will get it as it seems i will get more then enough for the money. Do you know what its like playing alone? As i have 0 friends that play destiny.
---
Nah my revoker handles that pretty well.
---
I like sniping kids across the map with mine especially when then get mad an keep running at me straight off spawn.
---
#heidy ho everyone
---
There's a ghost lore easter egg that says pretty much that. That the light lets them glimpse alternate realities. And darkness zones or areas where they can't resurrect a guardian are areas where there are no alternate realities, or where the darkness has blocked the light.
---
It's legit my favorite bow. It never leaves my second slot.
---
haha when you pug the gauntlet you always gonna wipe because of this
---
There is no way to play with ppl your LL. Its just random match making
---
Ty, that's really unfortunate. I'll just have to wait the Moon then.
---
Warlock main too! At work right now and playing D2 lol. Set up isn‚Äôt AS sweet as yours but using one of those Gaems briefcase-style portable units.
---
I cant wait for that lol
---
How bold of you to assume my computer can play D2 above 20 fps
---
Mote drain
---
Find a clan.  It is a great way to meet people and get help, and extra loot &amp; cores.  But there are many who play alone.  there are some activities that cannot be done alone:
---
Raids are designed for 6 man teams.  There is no matchmaking but it is easy enough to LFG a group.  While some of the lower raids may be possible to beat solo power wise, mechanics makes it impossible for most to be done alone.
---
Nightfalls are designed for 3 man teams.  Since the nightfall lvl is 540 it is certainly possible at 750 to solo a nightfall, but again LFG is easy enough to do to get a team, as there is no matchmaking.
---
Heroic Menagerie is designed for 6 man teams with no matchmaking.  I would guess this could be soloed by it would not be easy, but again LFG is available.
---
Pretty much everything else in the game is either solo activity friendly or matchmakes for you.
---
Just get foresaken because if you don‚Äôt you will not have many guns and will get wrecked in shadowkeep because people are gonna have way more exotics and guns like Luna‚Äôs howl and not forgotten and for pve people in raids want people with outbreak prime and such
---
I grinded out 4 hours yesterady and got most of the cool iron banner items, gunnoras axe, orewings maul, also got frostees cuz rng but im am not playing that ever again. 120 damage with a headshot golden gun point blank. No thanks.
---
Ppl should stop using low
---
Woah yup I‚Äôm ready for Shadowkeep bc I usually don‚Äôt look into too much bc I don‚Äôt wanna spoil myself
---
Not everyone with a sprained ankle needs to be informed that they‚Äôre using crutches
---
That‚Äôs great of you to do! I would do that but I just don‚Äôt find it enjoyable
---
I have come across a number of misadventures Frome people using snipers on me. Also, when I was testing these boots out with a friend, I could reflect a sleeper shot back at him and kill him but I would kill myself as well.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm surprised people complain about striker as being the most broken right now, to me dawnblade is just a better super. I guess it‚Äôs a trade off for the weird jump. Then again, I run armamentarium with double suppressors and all ordinance mods with demolitionist weapons so I shutdown every Titan super I see lol
---
Had a weird thing happen yesterday with the cryo public event in the Tangled Shore close to Spider...we managed to get the event to go heroic right as someone put the killing shot into the target. We got both regular and heroic rewards for it too!
---
mountain top / recluse / truth
---
If it is a randomly rolled (aka year 2) item, you cannot rebuy it from collections.
---
Holy hell. Nerves of steel to stand your ground and push through.
---
Bottom tree striker definitely needs one. Only for pvp tho.
---
Nice lol, totally agree that Dawnblade is better, but that‚Äôs probably just bc I‚Äôm a warlock main
---
well seasonal events seem to be getting a fair amount of love (especially solstice is looking like a handful rn) so i dont think its that out of this world to assume it can happen.
---
Shit, time to go do strikes and run away
---
You have an 8 yr old and you play video games with her?! That‚Äôs awesome!  What‚Äôs her favorite hero class?
---
It‚Äôs not that hard at all
---
I didn‚Äôt know it was that rare I got it from a chest in prison of Elders  like 3 months ago
---
Fog horn and clown was fun.
---
Yeah, I will say though that I feel like striker and one eyed are better for pubstomping in quick play versus comp
---
But it‚Äôs never too late admitting that Warlock is master race.
---
Thank you! I didn‚Äôt see this before.
---
#...get out. and never speak that cancer again. IT'S MASTER CLASS NOT MASTER RACE.
---
True
---
Ya it‚Äôs not gonna be available after 8/28. I‚Äôd recommend trying to get either broadsword (no glory requirements, but a pretty lengthy quest) or revoker (requires 3500 glory but you don‚Äôt lose progress towards it when you lose glory)
---
It will probably never get nerfed because bungie are actually inept at balancing PvP weapons and gear.
---
YES! I went back to D1 the other day for a nostalgia trip and i forgot how much i miss horns.
---
If i was to ask for a specific horn i would ask for an exotic horn that plays the benny hill theme.
---
Not a smart thing to say mate. A little bit of maturity goes a long way
---
I did lol, thanks for the suggestion. Destiny 2 is dwindling anyway, and for good reason. Enjoy your dying game.
---
Tbh they‚Äôre not that hard, but congrats
---
Yep and the glows have their own perks
---
Emo is literally the last thing I'd describe this sparrow as
---
I use a bow just for fun factor in both lol my teammates probably get rattled but I do pretty well. OEM shotgun apes are the bane of my existence. But I can respect people wanting to do good in those game modes so I understand abusing the meta. Even though it makes me want to throw my Xbox out the window.
---
Something's wrong with you.
---
please elaborate
---
I dig ur energy
---
what is this in reference to? I was saying OP was probably talking about how they needed Bergusia night shader hence the curated drop, not the refurbished shader.
---
Ana Bray is S class for sure. Amanda is top A class.
---
i disagree a lot
---
It is indeed YouTube
---
Look at those Amazon Echos
---
That's enough to make you quit? You honestly think it's better for a company to sell a "complete" game with a pricetag of over $100, that has less interactivity, is far more simple minded, doing almost the exact same thing every mission, and draws heavily from a game released way prior than to not have a manual block? I mean, to each their own I guess lol. I'm surprised Warframe hasn't sued honestly, probably because they can't compete with all that AAA money since they don't MAKE you pay for ANYTHING in the game; whereas Destiny makes you pay for everything.
---
I relate to this so much I always felt like I‚Äôm the only one who actually enjoys bows in PvP
---
This little girl looks more ready for a raid than most of my clanmates are.
---
Best comment I've ever seen.
---
... I was a Melee main, Aerial guarding was *CRUCIAL*
---
Naw, I was playing... I think almost 400 lol, haven't done Forsaken yet and I'm in the process of Warmind I think it is.
---
#OOOOOOF
---
I like you, you're a great example of how people who support something should act. This mentality you have, can actually change people's minds. Keep doing it. The whole, you don't like it then leave thing is equatable to THIS IS MURIKA, YOU DON'T LIKE IT YOU CAN GIT GONE.
---
Wait so every time we revived our Ghost is actually just pulling a *different us* from another reality?
