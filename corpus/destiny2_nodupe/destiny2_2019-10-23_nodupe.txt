Dan James really had a rough game last weekend.
---
---
---
Cool I just checked the vent yesterday and it was closed
---
Only ones are the gambit prime armour set. They give role perks, such as a full collector set allows you to collect 20 motes and send a mega blocker (big ol ogre) or full sentry set allows you to see invaders when they invade.
---
Going to be funny to watch people start complaining about hunters and warlocks once OEM is gone. If you're losing to OEM titans now, you'll continue to lose to those same players once they jump to hunter/warlock.
---
Play until a prime engram or any engram drops
---
Black armoury bow is probably your best bet unless you get a world drop one
---

---
Just head to Ada and pick up the bow frame
---
Alright, thanks!
---
Thanks! I’ll check it out.
---
There isn’t, there’s a reason recluse is meta on pc and pretty poo on consoles, but logic be damned
---
Honestly i think it was just luck lmao
---
Thunder coil + knockout + synthoceps is so much fun. I recognize it as pretty cheap but it's too damn fun. I even run it in pve because I just like punching things as a titan lmao
---
my fps drops to like 15 then back to 60, freezing. doesn't do that in any other game mode but prime.
---
:(
---
It is my new favorite bow cause it feels so heavy and even though better options exist in the heavy slot that is still a really fun option
---
Nice
---
BOING
---
badass dude
---
Haven’t gotten it yet but I am dying laughing 😂
---
I'm having the same issue on PC. I bought the $60 shadowkeep expansion, and should have gotten the season pass with it. On my season tab, it says the pass is active, but i cannot get the Leviathan's breath quest, yet i have full rewards on my artefact and access to the raid and shadowkeep itself. What do?
---
I shot a random boss and got it, nice one buddy, the gun is absolutely awesome I you have a melee/dmg build.
---
Also, the gun is insanely good in PVP
---
I did my Darci and Tractor Cannon, so idc, let them
---
The K1 lost sector in Sorrows Harbor kill one of the wizards for the next step load onto the leviathan solo kill all guards with a sniper or bow leave and comeback another 2x then go find Eris
---
The game's like "ya know what... Here, take it"
---
Seasons passes are purchased through silver. So you’d have to log into her profile and buy it that way. You can’t directly gift the season.
---

---
Or when you one two punch the boss and it just dies
---
Tends to happen when you eat crayons and run head first into walls
---
Heaby
---
You need a bow to get the bow frame finished though...
---
You got pretty lucky then. I completed the small questline and bounties on all my toons and almost every match had atleast 1 OeM titan on the opposing team.
---
9/10 times that was accompanied by an Erentil with ridiculous range, a Recluse...or a shotty. Hardly ever got killed by a primary. 
---
Randy's Throwing Knife is making people use scouts here and there but that's gonna fade with time. Can't wait for the OeM nerf though, gonna be a sad day for the titan mains with inflated stats.
---
Lag switching?  Probably not.
---
Oh so I need forsaken to get the last word too?
---
You're supposed to go into the hangar not where banshee actually is
---
alright thanks man, i appreciate it i’m just now trying to get back into playing
---
Okay thanks
---
I've gotten 3 year one exotics out of 6 nightfalls today. Besides the guaranteed ones, I've yet to get a Y3 exotic drop
---
nah they're just the worst ones
---
Naww, they're just wearing pendants to remind them of the Sanctified Mind!
---
It'd be pretty cool to have a sleek looking armour set like this though ;\_; or civvies
---
Remember, as a grammar Nazi, I was just following orders.
---
I wanted to do a bad Titan symbol in Paint, like it was drawn with crayons, but then I remembered I'm lazy.
---
well now imma try to grind for one of those rolls for sure but i appreciate the feedback. i don’t know much about godrolls and such.
---
Buy it on the platform you want to play.  Simple.
---
armor?
---
I love using thundercrash BC people are like OHH ANOTHER ONE GET FKD blah blah then they pop their spectral/striker/nova warp and I'm just like 'press Q to delete' lol
---
Edit: another striker titan*
---
What light level are you?
---
Try grinding weapons from menagerie, reckoning and the forges. They have some pretty good guns, like austringer, beloved, tatara gaze (kill clip OHK body shots in pvp), hammerhead, blast furnace, sole survivor, last man standing, spare rations are all great weapons. The rolls you’re after you could probably find on YouTube but for the sole survivor you’re after 1/2 punch and sole survivor you’re after 4th time’s the charm or triple tap with firing line. These are all very strong perks
---
But I have already bought it on the PS4 before learning about cross play
---
Thank you
---
Like all the new mods for armor.
---
You have to talk to banshee before anything, there isn't a prompt but yeah
---
"When you whisper to the void, does it whisper back?"
---
I get it but this is literally just me in the crucible because you can make some INSANE plays with the air dodge, for instance you can dodge around a shotgunner and destroy them.
---
(I know it’s not impressive)
---
I wonder if eventually they can resurrect after we feed them enough.
---
I got the same gun in the same random fashion...
---
" Here you go, a good exotic ar for you my good guardian"
---
"But why?!?"
---
"Just take it"
---
Thank you for my new background :)
---
Ok thanks!
---
Awww, poor thing. I feel sorry for him:)
---
Good to know.
---
There is no cross play.  There is cross saves where you can migrate your characters from one platform to the other but thats it.
---
Yes I too emote in my bubble waiting for a stupid striker to rush me, just to be met with my shotgun and fists
---
Watching hockey, need to go to bed in an hour.
---
Just wanna power through some Destiny.
---
Kuroko best.
---
Well OEM is for titans who have yet to progress so that’s perfect
---
Well, with that card you can get highest in all settings and go upto 4k 60fps.
---
I started f2p Sunday and took 17 hours to reach 900. And that's including about 4 hours some friends took me on a raid that we didn't finish showing and showing us mechanics (so basically no gear in that time).
---
I've done it through mostly story and public events with a few strikes thrown in.
---
Apologies, I misread your intent. That aside, unless they fixed it you can do that exotic quest banshee gives you for risk runner, and just farm the Walker at the beginning for a speedy way to 900 without it taking too long. It's not 950 but at least you're at the soft cap and have an easier time of things.
---
I...remember when I was at the top of the leader board.  It has drasticly dropped scince i stopped using bad juju in favor of learning how to use last word
---
Enjoy it man. Turn that FOV up too!
---
I usually just go to shuro with tether and a couple of banners, or grab my helmet with giving hand on it and farm the juju mission, melee kills on the leviathan give you heavy with that mod equipped
---
So you buy it?
---
Love it! Gonna set it for my desktop
---
Your graphics card has to be plugged in separately to power supply. Google says a 6 pin + 8 pin so dont forget to plug that in.
---
Well...I mean...Yeah pretty much.
---
Ok just for this, next time I play cruisible I'm running OEM,recluse, parcel of stardust, truth,and bottom tree striker. FEAR ME!
---
It may be available after tomorrow reset when the forge change, but we will see
---
So sudden death is kind of like mayhem in the sense it takes way less time to recharge on it's own? I've never really played it w/out shards, before it was always dub win or lose lol
---
Also, it’s a one-way portal. You know, the type of which there are tons in the game? The type we go through to start the Garden of Salvation raid? They kinda do exist, I get these posts are (mostly) a joke but I feel like a lot of people genuinely don’t understand this
---
Hey man, everyone shits on everyone. Titan's may eat crayons, but at least you aren't some filthy hunter weabu.
---
It’s been a thing as well as the scannable since launch of vanilla D2
---
[deleted]
---
Don't let it get to you, man. Stuff like this sucks ass, but as a fellow Titan player dudes talk mad shit because they want in on the circlejerk while it's still booming. Internet points make people assholes; nobody actually thinks this in-game unless you're actively trying to aggravate. 
---
Wear the tears as a badge of honour. Nothing lets others know that you are the wall a Titan should be quite like adorning your armour with their splattered blood.
---
Run whatever's fun for you, be that OEM, Recluse or even Khepri's Horn. You have every right to be as Titan as you want to be, Hunters and Warlocks be damned.
---
There's a lot of people that don't know that, to be fair
---
*slams desk in agreement.*
---
yeah, rly. we win no matter what. robots are no match for god-slayers.
---
Original?
---
Would you rather not know that exists?
---
Pray you never find out...
---
thank you! Honestly I agree that super kills aren't too impressive but the feed was too good to not include
---
only big problem is divinity is going to be hard for the general populace to get since you need to finish the raid to get it, whereas Eriana you can get straight away, or through the pass, and levi through the new quest
---
Nobody can or will stop me
---
I always carefully choose which NPCs I stand near while organizing my inventory/quests at the tower. By carefully I mean I never stand near Tess.
---
Well i would say practice but thats actually the wrong answer. Simply because if you keep loosing you do not get better at all. Maybe take a friend and just run around the maps to get a view how the map works and were chokepoints are.
---
Also if you play freelance.... welp even if your skilled it is all up to rng. I played about 80 games today and lost like 70 because i either had just 1 partner or the enemy team was WAY stronger ( i went from 4004 to 2900 and still got matched up to people far above 4000 so meh just a shitty day i guess)
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Edit: Also keep in mind this game is P2P so if you get matched up with someone in a different region where their latency might be wonky compared to yours it will not be benefical for you at all =D
---
Smells like poor
---
Cayde.
---
That’s perfectly timed lmao. I got mine in a fated engram from levelling up about an hour after it dropped.
---
My friends all have these +10 mods to various stats like Intellect or Strength. I don't have these, how do I get them? I can't find anything online saying that they even exist but they clearly do.
---
Every time Im melting mobs I have a window licking titan up my ass robbing my motes. Then goes and dies. Its wonderful in prime.
---
What area was this photo taken?
---
Well thankfully now recluse is insanely easy to get
---
Curated Inaugural Address.
---
Always have agreed with this
---
I mean you tried and got damn well close
---
Why’d you scribble out duty bound
---
I love it. Hits like a brick too!
---
BOOOOOO TITANS
---
Really late on this but that is correct. I’m stuck on that step now. Any chance you’ve figured out a solution?
---
Mad becuz bad ?
---
but how else will people get their internet points?
---
thank you! most of the planets are still locked for me; does that mean i have to continue playing random strikes and gaining XP before i can pick what strike to play?
---
Its free to play
---
I'm still trying to get, but maybe there is no drop?
---
Her first name isnt veronica unless thats her stage name
---
Update: I’m literally one win from getting it
---
So uh wheres that rule34
---
Monte Carlo is basically infinite shoulder charge. I've seen lots of Masks using a scout/pulse then finishing with MC
---
I believe ada has the quest and you just need to do the requirements there. As far as I know unlocking the forges isn't even a thing anymore so I wouldn't worry about it
---
If your lost on the quest there's some good guides for it on YouTube.
---
How to rupture half a million eardrums in less that 10 seconds.
---
[here](https://youtu.be/JNAxqc_Bk6M)
---
Quality kinda sucks but its got sound
---
You don’t Get rewards if you don’t kill all the champions
---
I’ve been playing since launch, I have enough weapons that I have something good of each weapon type of each element, along with all the rolls I like of all the weapons I like. And some Y2 armor rolls I liked for each class. That’s all 192 items, which is still nowhere close to 500. If your vault is that full, you probably have a lot of junk &amp; redundant gear.
---
I agree with the Flawless Execution nerf but 3 seconds gives very little playmaking ability
---
The weapon feel more fun to use and grind more than in Warframe.
---
Yeah for sure. I agree.
---
As a Titan this made me laugh.  Take your upvote.
---
*see you in the crucible*
---
Yah the Dreambane armor for titans is an astronaut suit
---
Bows are for fun and can't really compete in this game. Look at the other exotic bows, less perks and more draw backs than there counterparts.
---
I personally will still use it because I love bows, hand cannons and snipers. I now never have to use anything else unless a quest demands it or my raid team.
---
Just reset my rank, guess Im going back in for round two.
---
Yeah i've done the requirements for the first quest she gave me and forged a frame it was a machine gun if im correct, my question was literally about the forges if i needed to unlock them or do they have daily rotation. If i dont need to unlock them it would be easier to do izanagi's
---
That exact thing happened to me. Our team lost and I was the lowest on the score board (with just about dead on that ratio) and I was the one that got gjallarhorn. Mate of mine was fuming.
---
Masterworking armor does increase all stats but only by like 2 or 4 points I think.
---
Dutybound
---
Yeah I just went into reckoning to test out the bow and found that, is it only giving titan armor or is it just random?
---
Ah, yeah I’m doing that too. The fourth key that you get from a key mold is a different quest as you know. What you have to do now is complete your izanagi reigniter quest and you’ll get the mold
---
I saw this earlier too and thought it was someone who somehow died there, tried for a at least 30 seconds trying to revive them.
---
I’m down to clown
---
Perhaps, but 2017 game on 2013 tech with a hungry fucking engine for memory would be a bad mix, there’s a reason tanks were limited to some of the most simple, narrow areas in the game, even the Lunar Battlegrounds are mostly white space
---
No I think it’s the vanguard one
---
This is great dude, love the way you split the subclasses. I was wondering if you had a 21x9 version?
---
So valiant and kind to us screebs
---
Ah we make it a race to trigger it before they fuck it up.
---
Press right stick on PS4, if they have the dot above them and flash gold as you near.
---
Looks like the garbage barge from the outbreak heroic

Your submission has been removed. We do not allow indirect screen captures. Please take a screenshot and try again.

If you're going to post gameplay video or screenshots, please make sure it is not from a phone or similar recording, and is a direct capture, thanks!
---
BUT OEM STRIKER!!
---
It only effects warlock. And if the bug happens it will always be Titan gear.
---
Basically the one that banked dipped instead of taking out the blockers. (If any spawned. Or Vex cyclops sniped, or the high value minotaur stands on the top of the right side facing the bank on the Mars map. And no one focuses because they are to scared to lose motes or waste his motes. Because they are greedy.
---
Yah it was hard to avoid mid range battles, I kept getting the widow map when trying to get hand cannon kills
---
I run bumper jumper but literally go to your options screen and pull up your button layout.  It tells you how to perform the finisher
---
I don’t think you’d find many players who say getting to legend as a 3 hour endeavor even with the weird matchmaking of this season so far which is an anomaly anyway
---
every Crucible match there's always some squad with Sweet Business
---
Say again?
---
So simple on a first glance but so great looking too
---
Which changes the problem to power creep. How long until Recluse is unusable due to the meta being that much more powerful?
---
Just don't use it and tell everyone you refuse to dodge.  For karma
---
Wasn't there another one in a story mission? That or someone took over the harpy.
---
Shotguns would so ass in vacuums though
---
Bruh any way i can import it?
---
The stat ‘recovery’ shows how long it takes before your health starts to regen. You can boost this stat by wearing certain armor.
---
All of your armor stats are visible to the right of your character on your weapon/armor inventory screen.
---
So they've created a system that punishes you for playing the game? That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
---
Not sure if this is meant to be direc at anyone in particular, but just an FYI it's all players like yourself here on this sub.
---
2 hours a day is normal, but not for that long of time on one game lmao
---
🤣🤣
---
It took me 3 and a half hours to carry 2 heroic players to legend. That's all. Only one had ever hit fabled, and that was in season 4, and barely. He got to 2200 and stopped playing comp. So it is about a 3-4 hour journey.
---
“OEM is OP it’s Foetracer but overshield”
---
The Pregrine Greaves synergy was removed in the latest patch. Sadly, Hunters are back on top for melee
---
It's a heavy weapon, you're probably going to die to heavy if you give the opponent a good look at you.  Doesn't matter what they're using....
---
Nerf it
---
Explore some more with the super jump you get in courtyard.
---
I had 3 friends who were stacking and better than those two struggling to get out of sub 1000, the matchmaking this season is an anomaly, like I said, to use this season is cherry picking to the nth degree
---
As a poor hunter main I want to shoot myself in the face with the golden revolver
---
On Xbox you just hit guide and then Y. Pretty sure it's something to do with Print Screen button on PC. No idea for PS4 or Stadia
---
True
---
I thought there was with PC &amp; Xbox.
---
The Striker has a tree with a melee that triggers health regeneration. And the Insurmountable Skullfort says arc melee kills Grant health.
---
Do these things stack? Are they the same thing?
---
Yep, they're really cool !
---
Yeah it’s still bugged, there hasn’t been an update since they addressed it, why is this a shocker?
---
It’s a new exotic, why would they give it out basically for free
---
What a roller coaster ride
---
What are teh acronymssssss
---
ok thanks
---
Good write up, thanks. I actually barely ever find myself using the radar. I use sound more than anything to notify me if someone is nearby. A lot of my ability to spot the invisible hunters is most likely because I used to play the original AVP professionally, so spotting invisible predators was kinda an important aspect.. though, invis hunters still seem to have a slight glow/shimmer to them in this game.
---
It seemed like you shot one enemy, killed him, and all of the other enemies died when he did, while tethered? My  few experiences with it have always been disappointing.. but obviously I've been doing it wrong.
---
Press the crouch button when aiming at a low health enemy with a circle above their head.
---
Rounding
---
Had the same issue had a guy who kept dying because he wanted to try to sword the boss the whole time  made the fight take five times as long
---
The strike in the Vex Pyramidion. When you enter the in the massive area, before you drop into the hole. That area looks stunning as well.
---
You can have your wallpapers, we will take your sanity.
---
If it works, it works
---
Mayhem, tether, any special grenade launcher, and colony. Tether popular spots, and by their spawn. Use special launcher when they're tethered, use colony when they're grouped up and you can't tether, or into their spawn.
---
Feelsgoodman. Is the original thorn the lumina?
---
Nope finished all the way on both.
---
*Things you can say about your drops in Destiny but not your girlfriend.*
---
I’m on a mission to punch every single add and enemy and boss in the game and no one is stopping me
---
What?
---
You mean normal swords or the hive swords?
---
lol holly shit, that was satisfying !
---
Only because I was low light I love any form of pvp except supremacy
---
Im going to punch the shit out of it. I may die but that is a sacrifice I am willing to make.
---
Too accurate...
---
Nerf inbound. RIP sleeper.

[removed]
---
As I explained above, Inktober rules are made to be broken. People also use their own prompts. The goal is to grow as an artist and I felt like using a new medium (my tablet) to draw would be more challenging for me than last year :)
---
I don't know about the bug but it sometimes still feels that LH is really strong and better than some other guns.
---
Yes, Bungie f\*ed up on a lot of things with the Shadowkeep content. ( Like a lot of balancing stuff etc blah blah).
---
I dont kow how the LH felt before all those nerfs since i never got the Gun till a week ago. 
---
So far im switching between weapons and i still think the LH is a beast but sometimes it falls flat and i get killed easily by a Thorn or something.
---
Unlike your godly blessed gaming prowess in Comp im sitting here all day playing against people by far better than me and unable to even pass the 4k mark surpassing the 9h mark easily ( have a day off :P ) so i cant tell if NF is even worth getting. But i still want the gun. Even if its worse. It looks better =D
---
I fucking love it as well, it can hit over 50k precision damage sometimes meaning you can probably outdps most grenade launchers, and it has the blast radius of wendigo when fully drawn.
---
Just wish it wouldn’t be 75k to reset the artifact so I can get the bow mod.
---
how much faster?
---
Uh yeeeees
---
PUNCH HARD GOOD
---
ADS- aim down sights
---
TLW- the last word
---
As a fellow Titan main, I thank you for this. Made my day.
---
So I assume you’re talking about his weekly bounties? If so, there are a few reasons why you might not be able to get them.
---
-Your quest inventory is full. Completed some or get rid of some to make room in your inventory for new quests and bounties.
---
-you already have the weekly bounty in your inventory from last week and haven’t completed it yet. 
---
-You just completed the weekly bounties from last week and the game thinks you already have the weekly bounties for this week completed, so it’s refusing to give you this week’s weekly bounties. 
---
-If this is a glitch, you might have to restart the game or verify cache.
---
Like a regular bow.
---
My name is Scrotas End
---
ME HATE GLOWLY BLUE THINGY
---
now mod doesn't affect it. and it can't out dps made launchers cuz of the draw time on it. plus it only has 10 arrows.
---
[Ticket to rehab center for sad Titans](https://youtu.be/Mm0kmqYkGiI)
---
And that’s just the tip of the iceberg, baby, there are way more cool builds than just those
---
#gains
---
It showed up during reset which was 1 pm est for me. It took about two hours to complete.
---
what regular bow draw time? sry i barely touch bows
---
Oh I hadn’t looked at the draw time, idk what it is, but if it’s ~700 that’s still 100k dmg every 1.4s which is 70,000 dps.
---
it's 1300
---
I can hear this and I'm fucking dying
---
Bitten tree striker with wormgod gauntlets 
---
it’s fun in pvp
---
If you are on console, I wouldnt try too hard. The bug is that Luna's and NF do more than the listed 68 on the mag howl shot. If you hit someone for 50+50+68, the thats 168 damage, while a 0 resilience guardian has 178 (I believe. If not, it's in the 170s) health. So it shouldn't kill, yet it does. Also, Luna's can easily 5 tap at 50m due to the glitch, and high stability
---
As a titan who doesnt have OEM (literally the only fucking exotic helmet I'm missing) I dont feel like I'm a real titan.
---
That’s actually abysmal.
---
I mean the drifter looks pretty mouldy
---
Oh, yes! I've dreamed of this, want to see it a reality
---
FUCK GRENADES
---
SWEET BUISNESS OR BUST.
---
But that’s what I’m saying, like Osiris is old as dirt, but is he gonna one day have a heart attack and croak?
---
framerate? :D
---
I really dislike the entire champion concept as it is currently deployed. In nightfalls, or under level content I never want to run two primary weapons. And yet the most obvious choices for champion disruption are useless. 
---
Fusions should disrupt overload
---
Snipers barrier
---
Shotguns unstoppable. 
---
I thought they got the memo years ago. Bullet sponges and being under leveled isn’t enjoyable. So what do we get? Both higher health enemies and we are under leveled. 
---
Make the game more challenging with mechanics. It is lazy as fuck to throw health at an enemy and call it challenging.
---
Makes me wonder what Cayde was drinking in that one broken bar  trailer with the sweeper bot
---
Whisky
---
It is from unlocking artifact mods
---
But not efficient enough to be effective? Might as well use some other shotgun at that point sadly.
---
But precision does matter, and that might be useful.
---
it can be fun, but the sleeper simulant is probably a better choice
---
im beginning to think i actually just need to finish the intro quests for new light which i havent done yet
---
Nice screenshot, how did you get him in frame like that?
---
You may have unlocked an artifact mod, such as anti-barrier rounds or unstoppable hand cannon.
---
If you go to the mod slot of one of the flashing weapons and hover over the newly unlocked mod, it should stop flashing for that mod / weapon type.
---
In Aus. Think our reset is like 3am. But went on quickly to check some stuff. But well something to do tonight. should be fun :)
---
Unless the light like just extends your life span like alot idk
---
Le Monarque or legendary "Arsenic-4b".
---
I was wondering what that was too
---
Lmao just inspect and scroll through the mods, it flashes indicating you have unlocked weapon mods
---
Well technically the guardians are supposed to be immortal
---
As a titan main I appreciate this.  Now I'm off to put nebula rose on my one eyed mask.
---
nobody:
---
titans:
---
Yea you have to wait lmao
---
It's not *necessary*, but it is a significantly more desirable perk for most people.  Also, if you intend to improve with snipers instead of only hard scoping lanes, snapshot helps a ton.  It's practically a necessity if you intend to face off against a super as well.
---
Nothing is really actually necessary, the common quality sniper we get at the beginning of the game will kill with a headshot just the same as your tatara's.  But without a doubt, a well rolled rapid fire frame sniper is significantly better than izanagi's for PvP.  You'll get that low recoil and great handling with a low zoom scope that has a significantly faster ADS time.
---
Longer range isn’t it?
---
Strikes, freeplay, adventures. Anything on earth
---
you say that, but there isn’t a primary bow that has the AoE trashmob combustion that leviathan’s breath has, on top of it having unstoppable which isn’t available for bows currently, or having the ease of use and high shield/precision damage of Eriana’s Vow, which lets you pair it with an unstoppable handcannon or an overload smg/auto rifle
---
the reason why those mods are on there is to add build diversity to nightfall and nightmare hunts (or possibly the raid as well)
---
Nah im on PC but i'll just keep the LH im back at 3443 i give 2 cents about pvp anymore i rather keep to the better content in the game.
---
Fated engram from xur will save you
---
*laughs nervously in chaos reach, geomags, revoker, recluse and Hammerhead*
---
Wrong. If you did 10k damage your teamates got tons of last hits from all your work.
---
I will have to try that with him ty.
---
I think it should be Subsistence/ Rampage they gave the Subsistence more ammo then it used to have
---
Hunter's gotta eat. Glimmer economy has changed after all.
---
Delightful, indeed
---
Are they 900 power?
---
It's possible to be informative or state your point without trying to put the other person down. I can do more than hardscope and I certainly use may Fate with apr, snap and moving target to help with that. Happy gaming man!
---
The secret ingredient is magic
---
At least it’s not another sniper

I own the hard disc of the base game and he owns the digital copy of the base game.
---
Go to Banshee at the tower, he will give you a quest to do for the bow.
---
Random drops from like anywhere, cashung tokens is a good whay to get them if u ask me
---
Its even better when you novabomb when its not immune but due to its slowness it goes immune by the time the nova reaches it.

*laughs in bubble bro titan*
---
Whisper of the Worm is a nice gun to have as well as Jotunn from the black armoury
---
The way she talks makes it even worse.
---
Wtf is this shit!!
---
The Skullfort gives you your Melee ability if you kill an enemy, triggers health regeneration and gives a little grenade energy upon kill
---
Doesn’t the arc?
---
Random drops in the world. Also, each bow reserves mod adds 1 extra arrow, so a max of 12 with 2 reserves, and I think scavenger adds 1 extra arrow on pickup
---
That person made a post and you replied with "What?". I repeated the post like somebody repeating what they said because somebody missed it. 
---
Just a bit of a giggle.
---
I had that roll and I think they're very comparable, probably to the point of being preference.
---
I’ve had 2 drop as a casual forge player, one was 2 bounties into that step of izinagi’s burden and the other was a month or two ago.  RNG is a cruel mistress

What do you sell?

Powerful gear does nothing after 950 power so that's when you grind pinnacles
---
I use tether in meyhem
---
If you’re doing the ordeal and you see them unstoppable ogres charging ya, have no fear not only will this bow stop them in their tracks, crits will delete them. It’s like 3 shots for a kill.
---
I feel like the only way I can ever hit a snipe is if I somewhat “quickscope” Lol like I can’t hardscope for shit in this game 😂
---
Fact:OEM cried like babies when wormhusk was at its prime. 
---
But yeah it’s salty hunters. Justifiably salty, but still, salty hunters
---
I had already done most of the standard bounties. The kill bounties that do not reward cores, seem to count. Hence why this is a bug. 
---
Not to mention, they should all count anyway. It's a pretty bad system to let people run around doing whatever they want without this DLC, and then make a time limited quest where you could potentially, unknowingly hinder your own progress.
---
And shes not pink shes light red.

THATS IT IM GETT’N ME MALLET!

Are the team members which are not on your squad, term originating from battlefield 3 game, for their blue markers on HUD and mini-map. Probably popularized through BFF series.
---
The opposing team were Doritos, orange triangle marker.
---
You will both get shadowkeep but only one of you will get the seasonal content, premium season pass, vex offensive etc.
---
Shouldn’t be time gated, knocked this quest out on 2 characters last night in under an hour doing the 5 bounties that don’t reward cores, never heard of this bug before, didn’t run into it with my 3 characters back when forsaken launched either. Weird.
---
Oh man I ran into a fee games with big chungus in IB he was my nemesis for that day.

Yep, i know that. Running rampant in one match and then thinking, hey you are good enough to try survival only to get your ass handed to you.

As a new player if you actually take the time to learn about the lore, gotta say it's pretty good.

I was listing mods, sorry for being unclear. Icarus grip increases in air accuracy, most of the time when you shoot from the air your bullets go wherever, but Icarus grip makes them go where you aim.
---
For pulse rifles go with counterbalance if you feel your recoil drags to the left or right  instead of purely up. Targeting adjuster is OK if you feel you don't benefit from anything else. You could try a radar booster though.
---
For handcannons I'd use backup mag. 
---
As for perks you'll want things that either increase your stability or range, if you're on pc focus on range. Kill clip is really good on pretty much any gun and very powerful paired with outlaw. Thing like Quickdraw, snapshot sights and moving target are also good. For burst fire sidearms tap the trigger is godlike since it reduces the recoil on every trigger pull and makes hitting your targets so much easier.
---
The bounties are gone for the day once you've done them. I always clean up bounties because they give nice chunks of exp for how easy they are. I had already done them, hence I was going to have to wait if the other bounties don't count.
---
I see I never did the bounties up until that part so I had 5 ready to go, just because XP is irrelevant when doing the campaign, so that makes sense you gotta wait.
---
My dream bike is that one pike from when we fight the Rider. When you boost it leaves a trail of fire.

Let's be real, he deserved it.

Tbh i can see both sides.

For example
---
What if you love your class in one setting but absolutely hate it in the second? This is always a possibility. 
---
This is my major problem with current WoW, classes are so built by talent trees now, your class can go from the favourite to most hated in a balance patch. Because the playstyle in some cases can be so extreme in how much they change your playstyle.
---
As a hunter, I find it both more fun and hated to use blade barrage with shards of galanor. Even more evil in action
---
I still use it for anything “taken” it does stupid amounts of damage
---
I would say play with friends if possible
---
Fuck! I can't be friends with THAT!
---
They've adopted you.
---
Bruh moments all around.

This also explain the come back of so many jotunn. I've been seeing less of them for a while and suddenly every game lobby had one.
---
Nah best super in the game is the Jotunn
---
Gravity Falls is the gift that keeps on giving.
---
Also makes the best toast
---
Excuse me whaaaaaat
---
that was a joke, geesh, i can see some idiots with no sense of humor downvoting it
---
I did the exact same thing with wish-ender two days ago, and a warlock on the other team got so utterly confused, and could not figure out where he got shot from xD it was a blast getting 3 kills from up there
---
your average hunter, unnecessarily dodging probably just because they think it looks cool
---
New player here, my buddies introduced me to Xul last night.
---
At first I was using the pillars to avoid his lazer attack. Turns out they're destructible...
---
For a melee attack it is instagib. None other melee attack had that
---
That actually sounds interesting. Gonna give it a shot!
---
Cause also has been rebooted more than 6... Just didn't like the number 7 so never kept count
---
I had a similar issue, have you tried cleaning the vents on your Xbox? Because dust could be blocking the air flow
---
Very cool. Thanks!
---
I'm so sick of jotunn
---
i have bought (the silver was a gift so i bought it for a fraction of what i had gotten) so far i have rolled it with experience log for every single destination in the game except EDZ. trying to roll it with crucible, gambit and strikes experience log cause it looks dope as hell.
---
Oh so the bottom trend dwanblade is where it's at.i never use daunblade so I was confused which one was better
---
Just today I was playing with blueberries and the enemy primeval was already below half health when the drifter told us to bank our motes for the primeval. The whole team ran to the bank, but the one dude who had motes to deposit just stood and stared at the bank til the invasion portal popped up, went through the portal, got no kills, and died with all our motes. Needless to say, we lost that one.
---
New Light won't give you access to select Forsaken and some Year 2 Annual Pass content. This includes the campaign, Shattered Throne dungeon, Raids and most Year 2 Exotics, plus the middle subclasses.
---
That's what I said.
---
I don’t get it. What difference? It’s a valid question that a Warlock would ask.
---
Oh really? those things are a PITA especially since their vulnerable zone is so inconsistently exposed

TBH lucky pants is pretty nutty when running hand cannons, especially in crucible. The swap speed is so quick and the extra accuracy is noticeable. I tended to run six shooter Goldie when I used to be hunter main with lucky pants for the clean ups from snipe body shots (in crucible) and that worked pretty well (the one thing I miss from hunter is lucky pants. Just it give it to warlocks and I’d be ecstatic). Liar’s handshake, 1/2 punch and top tree arcstrider is still pretty fun, just doesn’t melt bosses well anymore (I can’t remember how it fairs against majors and mini bosses since the nerf). Bottom tree nightstalker is also pretty meta apparently (I swapped to warlock the week before forsaken so I haven’t tried it) and the reception seems to be that it’s enjoyable to play with, especially in crucible.
---
why is this nsfw lol
---
Just did the hand cannon one in Izanami Forge and it counted.
---
What was the bug? Im just needing to forge the last key, waiting for Bergusia to come around
---
Truth 100%
---
 frustration level 10000000%
---
Ran a bubble Titan specifically so I could pick up the two hunters I ran it with whenever I ended up being last guardian standing (which was a lot) in the boss room.
---
Even then nearly got killed my a pair of gladiators jumping in my bubble ready to tear me a new one while I was trying to deal with a colossus.
---
But is the titan smart enough to drive it or will he use it as a  sledgehammer?
---
Bro, what about your back? Please balance push and pull exercises to stay healthy :o
---
Patch notes say otherwise
---
Same
---
Ace of spades doesn't require you to win the gambit match so I'd say it's quite doable.
---
This is gold. I wish I could reward this
---
Maybe they stopped caring about how their faces look when they started wearing helmets all the time. Or maybe they wear helmets all the time because they are all so ugly and can't do anything about it?
---
(the main cannon is thundercrash)
---
Sometimes when my team is really far behind I pick off enemies from a distance to let them get motes and hit the portal every chance I get to be as big of a pain in the ass as I can for the other team.
---
Just doing Bergusia doesn't reward a key. You need a key mold from Ada, but due to a bug she doesn't give it to anyone.
---
This meme speak to me
---
I’m a titan main and my fire team freaks when I get a tank
---
How many times are they gonna dissapoint you? Sev'ral timez!
---
I agree with exotic limit for PvP but why on PvE?
---
^^^snitch
---
The reason they don’t load you straight into the red war is Bc they didn’t want people who had downloaded the game for around 6 hours to have to play a 6(?) hour campaign before they could do the fun content that destiny really revolves around (getting good weapons and raiding). Originally, you had access to zero locations, instead unlocking them when you reached them in the campaign and you where severely limited in activities you could do (crucible and strikes weren’t available until you got ikora back to the farm I believe, it’s been a while since I played the campaign). I agree that it’s impossible to learn what to do without a guide and the introduction needs a rework, but I sorta agree with not forcing the campaign on new players, since it is hardly destiny’s strong suit (I get that to people who are unfamiliar with destiny’s gameplay loop, the campaign is their expected content, but it really isn’t the best of what destiny has to offer)
---
That's so bizzare I just had a moment like that earlier and we over there zavala for our triangle overlords
---
Ooh OK I see, yeah no I had the mold and everything already
---
I've been guilty of this recently, but I'm currently trying to bank 50 motes for curated spare rations, so if anybody sees me trying to collect all the motes I can carry, dont fret cuz I'll be in crucible shortly after to hinder an even larger team.
---
Dissociative Exomind Rejection, the big hurdle encountered during early attempts to transfer human consciousness to a robot body in order to achieve immortality. Once transfered, the mind would 'reject' the unfamiliar body much like your body rejects foreign tissue. 
---
The only solution they could find was to 'reset' said mind during the transfer - erasing memories of the old body, and life, of the subject forces the mind to essentially 'reboot' with the new mechanical body. It was a success, but hardly the goal they had in mind initially with the exo project. 
---
The big problem was that it was not a permanent solution. Over time the strain from DER would come back, and if left 'untreated' would result in death. Even worse, it was discovered that the maximum amount of 'reboots' a consciousness can practically handle is 20, and anything past that is considered almost always lethal. 
---
So, in essence, the Exo project was a complete failure, completely missing the original goal of immortality.
---
And yes, Banshee has been reset over twice the amount thought  possible. The fact he is alive at all is a miracle by itself.
---
Oh yeah my bad... Giant blocker is also annoying yeah

In Black armory you could get a mold once specific forge was open.

Sad ;_;

I was just checking the God Roll Spreadsheet, mostly interested in PVP, yesterday I asked here and was told that I can freely delete all Y1,Y2 weapons lol.
---
Today I found out that some of them I deleted are kinda popular in the PVP (assuming they are good as they are in the GOD roll sheet)
---
The weapons were:  Antiope-D, Hlafdan-D, Valakdyl, Nightshade,Play of the game, Does not compute
---
The question is, should I try to recover these?
---
Also anyone can reccomend some good weapon combo for f2P player?
---
I like to use handcannons, still using Better Devils, also some Auto,Scout could work.
---
Thanks
---
They made it so they can process food and drinks

No warlock. How... disappointing...

For real though, looks sick!

Where's Husky Raid when you need them?
---
Nothing, after you buy Shadow keep Deluxe, you will have access to everything.
---
I had the same thing happen; but I only saw 3 ghosts. Probably a glitch as mentioned before and limited to the number of players in the instance you’re in
---
Thank you! Will I need to buy more again in 1 years time?
---
Let's not forget the true problem.
---
Osiris can have a beard but we can't !
---
Funny how only two motes are needed to summon the primeval and a guy is running around with 15 motes in his pocket -\_-  
---
Also funny how some just shoot at the primeval outside the buff zone.  
---
Also funny when you see everybody wasting their super on the waves.  
---
Also funny to see that nobody uses void super to damage primeval.  
---
Also funny when everyone ignores the guy invanding.  
---
Also funny to see how nobody saves his nades (or just don't use it) for/on the primeval.
---
New light comes with Destiny 2 base game and Curse of Osiris &amp; Warmind dlcs. Then there is forsaken which you own and after that there is the 3 updates (Black armory, Joker’s wild and Penumbra). Now there is Shadowkeep with its own 3 updates included in the deluxe.
---
You seem to be missing the 3 updates after Forsaken. I would say Black armory and penumbra are worth it while joker’s wild is not (imo).
---
?repost
---
Yes, Destiny 2 is in a much better place these days.
---
Thanks! 2 Questions as a returing Y1 player
---
1. Should you wait with exotic quests until you reach a certain light level?
---
2. I have soooo many quests active, anything you should prioritize when lvl 750/800?
---
3. If i am starting to like it, what should be the first purchase? Forsaken? Shadowkeep?
---
Thanks!
---
Alright, I'm gonna sound dumb, but can anyone explain this to me?
---
"pvp" rewards, yeah the weapons you get from glory is the best you can get for pve, i absolutly hate pvp but i feel handicaped if i dont get for example recluse or mountaintop for pve.
---
I started Game when it comes Steam (without shadowkeep or forsaken DLC) 
---
I have this gun
---
For armor try I would recommend going for a scavenger for your special ammo weapon (eg. Sniper scavenger if you use a sniper). Loader mods are excellent and since you use an smg and handcannons you can get an enhanced loader for both from the seasonal artifact. For boots try traction if you have it. it makes you turn faster while sprinting. Mods that increase stats like mobility, recovery and intelligence are good for any piece. It's good to experiment a bit and try to find mods that pair with your weapons, subclass and playstyle.

I still need to get invader denied for my lumina quest and it feels like whomever I’m grouped with stands in thee center as an easy target every time. I don’t understand why you wouldn’t take evasive action to hide/hunt the invader. SMH
---
it’s a bug that it spawns so early, it’s supposed to spawn 90 seconds in or something like that
---
Try:
---
- go back to orbit
---
- restart destiny
---
- play one more pvp match
---
- load into the tower
---
- change characters
---
I’m very confused again :(
---
Me too personally, just had a request for this so did it anyway
---
Would you just recommend restarting with a new character or is enough similar to just pick back up where I left off two years ago.
---
That seems more reasonable, any clue on how long until they fix it?
---
pick up all the moon bounties, go to a lost sector, complete them. about 5 -7 mins if you’re well equipped (eg void handcannon can do void kills and handcannon kills at the same time). rinse and repeat
---
Having people believe they are part of an uber-race and have to subjugate everyone else or go down deservedly? We had that a few years ago and it did not go well for them. 
---
Though they did not play the numbers game and lost to the numbers game, while the Hive are playing the numbers game and are losing in the quality game. Or the reviving game.
---
The other example of aggressive racial superiority, the Krogan, did also play the numbers game and did not win either and lost to the quality game (your mileage may vary, though).
---
So it seems, racial superiority is not a winner-concept, so far. But who knows, maybe next time?
---
Uhhh... no?

Annual pass and forsaken merged as of last month. He has everything.

no idea but that + the amount of sweats still at 0 glory is deterring me majorly from comp. waiting about another week for the top tier people to move up. I was at 0 glory and matched against a NF user. i’ve reached fabled once ever in my 6 seasons of destiny and it matched me against a legend
---
I always wished for more cutscenes and my characters having dialogue, but now i just wish for the ugly bastards to keep their helmets on and stay in their corner!
---
yeah i totaly agree, i like fast paced games and this is so incredible boring and slow, and only having 3v3 games, i like rushing and flanking in pvp and having both teams just snipe all the time gets boring super fast, sure i can prolly go around and flank but i need to play with the team and they just stand there sniping.
---
after just 8 games played i can already tell that i will never have the patience to get to the rank i need even if i win everything.
---
Reasons why standing still for even a moment is a death wish #1
---
"moon's fucked now"
---
Love that sentence
---
Played a gambit match yesterday. We were short 3 motes for the primeval. 3 enemies outside spawn. I killed them and was running back to bank and I saw my teammate ran inside the spawn guns blazing. Dude was literally behind me  and paid no attention whatsoever to the fact that all we needed was 3 motes and I already had them. After I banked I looked for him. Dude was at the back of the enemy spawn gathering motes.  Shit like this makes me think teammates are blind.
---
Pretty sure there are 2 separate bounties for this. 
---
You get the offering for the Oracle by purchasing a bounty from Petra every week (no dlcs required), and complete it by just doing Blind Well activities. You get the offering and you can offer it to the Oracle for rewards. No DLCs, I repeat. 
---
The other bounty about being ascended and completing the Corrupted Strike does of course require the Forsaken DLC, however this bounty isn't purchasable from Petra but it is a random drop when completing Dreaming City activities. This bounty, requires you to have the Forsaken DLC. 
---
TL; DR: OP is talking about 2 separate bounties which has no ties or relation to each other in terms of obtaining, completing and receiving rewards.
---
Curse week. Spawns more often but drops from it are less likely because of that.
---
The most frustrating part of gambit i come across.  When you need a good invade to either get ahead or catch up and the same teamate takes the invade over and over again to get no kills.
---
Thx
---
I'll probably just finish all pending quests and then remake, ty!
---
Ty
---
It's random, just keep playing... It used to spawn very rarely.. now it spawns a lot more often
---
Campaigns first, they'll help you figure out what activities there are etc.
---
After the many hours of all the campaigns you'll undoubtedly know if you want to keep playing the game for the grind or just for fun or just casual pvp with friends.
---
1.	I didn’t downvote despite the inverse
---
2.	I didn’t accuse anyone, I even framed it as a question
---
Not everyone is looking for an argument, relax man.
---
I suggest you start with the red war campaign. Because it tells the whole story of how destiny 2 started. And you also get a free exotic at the end. If you want to I could help you threw with the game. :P
---
Gamer tag: Spyro lad

Yha it should be just look up the name LightDust Raiders

My advice would be bring friends! It's a good group experience as well as solo!
---
Does your steam need an update? As far as I know it has built-in dualshock 4 support, mine has been working flawlessly.
---
Getting to the boss room was fine; between the three of us I think my fireteam only suffered one death when dunking the charge.  The boss room, however, was pretty much a ruckus.  We unloaded on the boss at the start as usual and only did a sliver of damage; then it was just a matter of frantic survival.
---
Did you tried steams controller configuration setup?
---
Eris: *just stands there worried*
---
In my opinion, the end game is the best. Raids, comp, etc. So I would be leveling up as quick as possible. However, to be competitive and extra helpful, you'll need some loot, that's were the grind comes in
---
I somewhere read its because originally warlocks were supposed to have extended range and thus they compensated that with the lower speed. They removed that range (exception being melee ability of the arcclass), but we are stuck with these slow ass slaps
---
Am I the only one who honestly hates gambit? Every reset I’m so sad that I have to play 3 matches to get that engram. What am I doing wrong?
---
hahahaha hey LOOK! It's...me!?
---
Yes do the campaigns first. Once youve done all that work on the weekly challenges to level ur light up. Dont do exotic or legendary quests until ur like 910 light. Cuz it will just give them at lower light levels and they will quickly become useless. Stick with the regular blue weapons for a while until ur 910 light. Not that the game one give you legendaries here and there. Use them until u get better loot. And dont try and do things way beyond ur light level. Cuz its pointless until ur get to 910 light. Like nightfalls.
---
I'm on xbox but idk how these clans work and if there cross play but still join so u can rep the clan on the PC side

Finally got anarchy today too, after 5 runs. Got 1k in one run, never did last wish again.

I don't know if the curse was at it's strongest last week, but I farmed all of my meatball drops last week
---
I did try to make him aware of that fact. Honestly, some people.
---
My suggestion is bounties but watch your glimmer! If you like crucible then keep dipping in and out with the random ones, or if you prefer strikes do the random ones from zavala
---
I had 150k glimmer and now I have 10k rip, but my season is currently at 55 and I don't get much time to play either
---
People bitch about the one eyed mask titan exotic in crucible, this guy is wetting his panties because he is going against 3 titans with one eyed mask.

Shadowkeep changed crit lowered crit damage on Red bar enemies so everything is ok
---
Give his parents a medal, they deserve it to be responsible parents.
---
I know, right? Some of the best, most fun PVE Weapons are locked behind fucking PVP. If it‘s just „play crucible matches“ then eh I guess, but reaching Rank in Comp where it‘s literally 90% Tryhards? Nah ty lol.

Even knowing that . . I still don't get the joke.

Wrath of Xivu Arath but considering he's friendly, I've taken the liberty of naming him Tim
---
Oh damn was hoping it would get better cuz having to 2 shot regular ads is kinda annoying
---
I just remembered, the auto from the vanguard assault is fairly good for pve, I used a masterworked one until I got the breakneck
---
Steam has built in PS4 controller support, at least in big picture mode.
---
Yes!
---
no u will need to get forsaken separately, u can get season pass when u buy shadowkeep
---
unfortunately you gotta buy Forsaken and Shadowkeep seperately. 
---
i’d say the season pass is quite worth it if you plan on putting lots of hours into the game for the next month or so since that’s when it ends
---
I think it's just RNG.
---
Are you seriously dim enough to believe that it was Activision who insisted Bungie include pvp in Destiny?

The statistics disagree

No, Forsaken is a separate purchase.

If you buy Shadowkeep, you will get the current Season Pass with it. It is a good way to see for yourself if this is something worth your money. 
---
It basically just is more stuff to get plus some xp boosts for players that play a lot.
---
Oh shoot
---
drink better pops
---
Which makes it even more surprising that the weakling hunters and warlocks can even use it.
---
Pick up moon bounties, with either VO bounties or nightmare bounties. Then do VO or nightmares
---
Don't know why your above comment is getting downvoted, wasn't my intention bro. No worries
---
Rick cactus can shove it
---
Idk how I forgot about all the armor drops haha thabks mate
---
Not really. Only one melee is actually longer range. Warlock melee is just very very situational, but the rest of our stuff... Now those things hurt like hell.
---
Yeah, I know, but we also have to take in consideration that OEM is the only good Titan exotic in PvP
---
And as the game is so bad at telling how to start the story missions you have to go to Amanda Holiday in the hangar at the Tower . She will give the mission to you because the game does not start it automatically like it use to do. The story missions will get you some good exotics at the end to start with.
---
I don't like sand.
---
PS4 Button prompts and everything? More importantly, are you using a wired connection or are you using Bluetooth? I’m using Bluetooth to connect my controller and I think that might be the issue.
---
Thanks for the new wallpaper! This looks great
---
My thoughts exactly. Why have a sniper and never hardscope, that’s the whole point of sniper.
---
Nothing, the way Bungie implemented Gambit sux a pair of hairy balls.
---
No worries. It's easy for people to overlook Xur so I just want to make sure people are aware that they can get older exotics from him!
---
Painfully accurate
---
So in response to this, I tried last night and refused to plug in the controller and use only the mouse and keyboard and was pleasantly surprised. 
---
Aiming feels nicer and much smoother at 60fps than console, but my abilities are very very sluggish as I am not used to the binds. I am very used to using the 12 number pad on the mouse in MMO's and tried to not use them at all for Grenades, Super, Melee, Class Ability, Weapons etc, but I honestly think I will need to use them. I missed so many easy melee kills cause I'm not used to having to press a key. 
---
Probably didn't help myself by playing in the crucible but though to throw myself in the deep end. 
---
Also my jumping/strafing and general movement is awful too!
---
Holy sh*t this is awesome, your awesome, destiny's awesome!
---
The amount of times we’ve needed 1 mote to summon and some mf blueberry isn’t coming back to bank til he hits 15 motes
---
“How do i unlock xur” is the funniest shit i’ve seen all year
---
Never said that, but you guys always had the best supers, better exotics, I could go on here, and titans only have OEM as the only good pvp piece. 
---
Just to clarify here, I don't main titan and never had a problem with OEM, since you can easily counter him, just have to be smart about it
---
Hmmm... pretty good name tho
---
cant wait for that shit to get gutted
---
Nobody knows yet, but it is likely that we will see a new expansion somewhat next year.
---
Yea! I was pretty sure he had everything up until shadowkeep I just couldn't remember what they all were
---
That would explain why every Titan seems to be so severely brain damaged.
---
Yes
---
it's random now, used to spawn the most on max curse weeks, but they brought the spawn rate up to the same level for all weeks at the start of season of the drifter iirc
---
Now that I’ve been in Banshee’s workshop, I can see how poorly he’s doing. I fully expected to see Banshee-45 at the Tower after Cayde.
---
oh that is great. easy way to increase light level of my titan
---
Hello, As a free player, I didn't understand how I was able to access the black Armory forge, could someone explain me the process ?
---
YES i hope they add a “Loadout” feature soon man, having loadouts set up where u can just click it and it auto changes all your gear to whatever is saved in the loadout... D2 needs this badly, especially for console players cuz those menus load so goddamn slow
---
Truth but you gotta be able to quickscope as well to be a properly effective sniper, otherwise it's too easy to get tunnel vision watching the lanes
---
Unfortunate that you can have more than one person with the same name on steam, cause that's probably just a poser
---
I hate when they are passing by mote bank when we have enough to summon. One guy in my team passed by the bank with 15 motes, yes you read that correctly ,15!!
---
Idk, I use it a lot for support. I'll clear a pack of adds and give my team like 7 super orbs and end up with half my super back. Great for vex offensive. Doesn't pack the punch of other supers but synergizes really well with teammates
---
Tower's haunted
---
When you select the game mode it shows you whether its Glory, Valor or whatever.
---
me to
---
No inches aloud here folks
---
You mean better than the best-selling soft drink in the world? Right, no worries.
---
Ah did not hear of this, cool
---
Yea I mean if I were to become a sniper in pvp then I would like to train myself to quickscope. But people who think you have to quickscope if you use a sniper and they criticize you if you hardscope at all.
---
I think its resets across all seasons triumph so you should be fine reseting a few times this and then a few times next season.
---
One Eyed Mask
---
I miss that warlock helmet.
---
Nah both methods are viable. Is rather have teammates that hardscope and land their shots over teammates who quickscope and miss
---
Yea
---
darci isn´t good for boss dmg anymore
---
I hate Gambit though
---
Meet and greet gone right
---
Talking to him makes me sad. It reminds me of my late gram who slowly developed Alzheimer's. She'd make amazing stained glass pieces while mistaking me for my uncle after a few minutes.
---
And Recluse still exists...
---
_2/3 Vanguard leaders aproof_
---
How do you even get your infamy that high? 2000 Valor? Sure. 2100 Glory? Okay. 15fuckingthousand infamy? Fuuuuuck that
---
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
What shader is that, boss?
---
What makes it worse is I accidentally took my friends into a regular gambit match instead of gambit prime and we got the meatball kill
---
It specifically says in a single season. Don’t give out false info if you don’t know.
---
Ok thank you
---
I'll never win... There's so many characters.
---
Welp
---
Glad you like it!
---
The Hive must have a fantastic dental plan, look at those pearly whites!
---
Thanks! Make sure to get it from Dropbox for full resolution
---
There will be no Destiny 3 anytime soon and I guess we'll see another expansion after Shadowkeep.
---
Since sales of annual and seasonal passes are the biggest revenue generators, Bungee is forced to continuously generate new content if they want to continue earning money.
---
I believe they will be able to keep with the current cycle: 4 seasons with each season lasting for 10 weeks.
---
Yeah because being on the internet and having an opinion is totally uncalled for, case in point look at yours. I put a post and you took it personal enough to insult rather than have the conversation. Totally uncalled for mate.
---
Done! This is great! You're awesome for even linking the dropbox
---
But the real question is. Where did calus get a bike chain string enough for this bow to work
---
yea. this.
---
You definitely wouldnt want to play like that. It's definitely sub 60 fps at times. I keep it at 120 fps + normally for my 120hz monitor.
---
I have a Boss Spec Sword. Your arguement is invalid.
---
It is still Melee.
---
Byff was in a fireteam with my one clan member "alien cheek clapper", was awesome to see it on his Twitter..
---
Still waiting for mine to show up somewhere
---
Correct me if i am wrong.. but i thought the meatball almost always spawned when it became sudden death.

Great work Guardian! However loot/roll/achievement posts are prohibited to prevent our subreddit from being cluttered (we get way too many!) - please keep these submissions in the weekly pinned loot/achievement thread. Thanks!

If you've got a question concerning if a roll you've got is good or not, try /r/ShardItKeepIt !
---
Sounds fine.
---
Too accurate.
---
1. you can attempt as soon as you like , but make sure you know what the quest is about as some of them have some really difficult strike-like quest you need to complete . like outbreak perfected and whisper of the worm.  side note , you can reacquired any exotic that you own in collection tab , downside is that , it need some material and always 20 power level than you currently power level.
---
2. you should focus on reaching power level 900 before anything else and the best way to do so is  grinding playlist strike , this is the fastest way to reach power level 900 . and DO NOT CLAIM ANY POWERFUL GEAR REWARD BEFORE POWER LEVEL 900. 
---
3. forsaken have some really good weapon in the game , namely joturn , izanagi burden , hammerhead (with right roll) etc etc. but shadowkeep is the latest expansion which everyone is talking about so pick your poison.
---
He appears every Friday at reset time
---
And goes away at monday same time.
---
Friday reset. Only available from then till weekly reset on Tuesday.
---
Ah I didn’t realize that.
---
Looks like New Age Black Armory; you can get it from the Black Armory armor or legendary weapons.
---
This is inaccurate, Titans have to wear OEM. It's in the "how to Titan" handbook.
---
Should have asked him how many invades it takes to summon a primeval...
---
Illustrator just had to add the OEM..... Touché.
---
Lag and slight desync sometimes makes it impossible to dodge because what you see and what server sees is not the same.
---
Nice! I’m going to have to check if I have that particular shader! Thanks Guardian.
---
not sure but might be Crucible Vermillion
---
Thanks! 2. Is really clear, I will grind some bounties in strike / vanguard.
---
But 1. I meant, if I do an exotic quest now, will the exotic be low light lvl? And if I wait until I am 900 wil it be high?
---
... I’m contacting PETA
---
Oh wait they’ll kill the entire population...
---
This deserves more attention
---
Not once did i state that what i said was fact. 
---
No need to get hostile because i made the wrong assumption.

Dragon__Ma5tr give me an add. Meand my group of friends tend to run the old raids fairly regularly, you'd be welcome to tag along
---
*Illuminati noises*
---
"So you have chosen death"
---
... And console instead of PC ... Sorry Bud, can't help you
---
I’d say hunters are easy mode because your dodge is essentially a get out of jail free card for poor positioning. Especially this season since there is a mod that gives you an overshield on dodge and makes you basically unkillable mid dodge.
---
If you see such nicknames, there's high chance they're just mediocre players trying to intimidate you with stereotypes. Don't Koreans have their own servers, by the way?
---
On EU servers, the vast majority of players with Korean hieroglyphs I encountered ended up with \~0.5 efficiency at the bottom of the scoreboard.
---
Since vanilla there's was literally only one guy who lived up to these stereotypes and was sniping me with headshots in my feet with 360 no scopes the second I make a step outside radar behind him.
---
I read the Titan in Ed's voice and now I can't stop laughing!
---
They said there will be a new game which is not destiny franchise in 2025 so they have to make content if they want to have money to that game so most likely there will be more in the next few years.
---
If my luck still persists from the start of the game I swear it’s gonna give me another mob justice. I originally wanted the rocket launcher.
---
I looked it up. You need to do the quests for the whisper of the worm sniper and sleeper stimulant. Look up tutorials for then and you'll get it. The missions are pretty hard so bring someone along with you.
---
And another question that I can't find answers for;
---
Will higher stuff drop if you have higher light stuff equipped? Or does it scan your inventory as well?
---
On behalf of all actual titans we reject your statement and we throw more grenades. 
---
Now where did I put those crayolas
---
Yea too many close and narrow lane maps. Shotgun heaven
---
Its a glitch. When you change location the Game wants to put your ghost somewhere. But it glitches out and puts your ghost down there. One time 2 Fireteams of 6 teleported in my lobby and i saw like 20 ghosts down there...
---
How far into the Quest is it bugged? Im on the Bergusia Forge step after collecting the crystals.
---
Black Amoury is only unlocked partially for New Light,  you still need Forsaken for its exotic such as inazagi burden, jotuun.
---
Yep, this is an automatic L. It’s their hour. Let them have it.
---
Who is hostile lol
---
Switch your voice chat channel when doing group activities to team chat. It is usually on fireteam chat by default.  You have to wait until a Crucible match or Gambit round actually starts.
---
On PS4, press the Touch Pad, then D-Pad right to enter team chat, left to go back to fireteam.
---
To switch channels on PC, hit TAB then the right arrow key to switch over.
---
Y'know I went back into that mission once I had the bow (to help my friend) and it does unhealthy amounts of damage. I think I clocked 93k on one hit.
---
The hive don't want to improve anything. They just kill anything they can and whatever doesn't die deserves to live until it is eventually killed. Eugenics is meant to improve, the hive simply want to cull the weak.
---
I loved gravity falls!
---
i mean half of the damn exotic quests require pvp activities
---
I truly don’t understand it.
---
My buddy is in the same boat, I heard theres gonna be a patch in the next couple of days. Could be wrong dont quote me on that.
---
git gud
---
That’s objectively wrong, doubly so when warlocks and hunters have dominated the PVE meta for years

Nice Gravity Falls gif use here.
---
I did it 3 times before it actually gave me the triumph
---
Dude can you make one with the different raid bosses?? If you have time i mean.
---
You have to be 800.... And have completed the red war...
---
Definitely would be nice to have a native feature in the game to do this. Heads up in case you don't already know, you can do this with 3rd party apps. I even have it set up to where I can tell my Alexa device/app to "equip my raid gear" and it equips my predetermined set. I think you can have 3 preset with the Alexa skill, other apps may have additional set slots.
---
Thanks I'm glad you like it!
---
Try pc. You can transfer your character and theres a bunch of people who want to do old content.
---
Interceptors have little particle effects compared to the drakes and their physics were almost copies of sparrows
---
And they were kinda reskinned Revenants from Halo Reach so that probably helped
---
I know i also used to be a titan main but i need some variation even tho titan is my favorite
---
is it matter? it is over 60 fps all the time
---
I had one walk up to me the other day while I was aiming down sights and he didn’t even shoot me.  When I turned towards him he just looked at me before I finally headshotted him.  Felt bad :(

Shotguns have been meta since season 5, pinnacle hand cannons have been the meta since they were made

Bungie should add this as a 3 man finisher, would be awesome

😂😂
---
Hmm
---
Ok, thanks
---
Whats the best way to clean the air vents?
---
If you hit crits, you'll out range any shotgun every single time. Plus they're more consistent since you arent worrying about pellet spread or anything

I got one song that murders in the crus, “Eat, Sleep, Rave, Repeat.”

---
Hahaha I have a good time during raids but sometimes...just sometimes, there is that one guy that thinks it's ok to use a tigerspite during damage phase :|
---
Uhh nope. They'd be better. No air resistance so pellets would go much faster much longer
---
Snipers beat hc and shotguns. Tactical play can beat shotguns. Or just play Titan and get the trades with 1 punch 😂
---
The best part about Gambit is that the Drifter tells you *exactly* what to do.  If you listen to him, you will do well.  "Bank those motes!"  "Hey!  Your team has enough motes for a Primeval!"  "Kill the blockers!"  "You're being invaded!"  "Kill the Envoys!"  "Primeval's compromised--Burn it down!"  And so on...
---
if u reach the maximum Valor 2k/infamy 15k u can reset your rank

Can you show me the picture of it?

If you excuse me I will go hang myself now

I have an idea of making the traveller in the middle the caged traveller from the red war. That way u have one more slots for black armory

I would check my face for any extra eyes.

Do you have a discord?

I didn't think about using that mod with this super. Thank you!

11pm: I'll just farm a few more stuff.

11am: ... Shit.
---
Was expecting a GTA "WASTED" banner to come up.
---
Am slightly dissapoint
---
Not accurate. Funny though.
---
You should be the first to summon your primeval. 
---
You want to let them summon theirs, and then send your blockers as you summon yours.
---
Can we get a link or higher res?
---
I like how only Zavala looks ready for the pose whereas Cayde and Ikora look awkward.

*vengeance

I was thinking of becoming a guardian irl but if we need a vow of celibacy then I’m out.
---
It's great for ads and has a great synergy with my nezarec's sin void warlock build.
---
I am pretty sure he occasionally remembers him. It's not like he lost his memory, it's just that it is a complete mess. So one moment he is sad, the other moment he does not remember that Cayde died, the next moment he does not even remember his name, then he does not even remember him as a person, and then he is sad again because he remembers Cayde died, and then he again thinks that he's alive...
---
Oof, just thinking about that is frustrating. And at least that's how I understand Banshee's current state of memory.
---
Mine is stuck at 22% and didn't go up at ALL even after 2 ghost medals and a shaxx made this
---
They're doing bounties, obviously. Why would anyone play gambit for fun?
---
Not enough boolet
---
with tracking to make sure you hit that sucker even when he tries to run
---
Bro I didn't even notice the second hello had the letter i in it wow
---
They just keep trying to break the environment props and run to the mode of the map.
---
Shit, have you seen the destiny app forums? This place is sunshine compared to there.
---
What shotgun is that and how does one get it?
---
As a titan main, I appreciate the memes
---
But I play as a titan because I like Halo and Gears and I want my titan to be a mix of Master Chief and Marcus Fenix
---
They wouldn't spread much I don't think. 
---
Spread happens because air resistance. Pellets in front will slow down quicker, pellets behind will hit them and deflect. Along with just air resistance in general deflecting pellets off a straight path. 
---
With no air resistance they'll all stay same speed out of barrel. They won't individually encounter different forces acting on them to cause then to deflect from their straight path. The ones in back won't hit ones in front to deflect.
---
At least 6
---
Favorite I've seen so far since relaunch is 'Registered Vex Offender'

This is amazing. Great job Guardian
---
Same!!
---
I hope this was in a real game
---
When handing in bounties try being in a fireteam for that xp boost. It's an additional 8% I think
---
So TIL there are people without malfeasance still. Prepare to be extramly disappointed and to have your day ruined when you finally get it.
---
Wait, you can't upgrade it?! I forgot to grab it and had no idea!
---
Nice wallpaper, for a second i was like...the fuck this dude just did...Nah that a wallpaper !
---
The "strat" used to work better but I think the bonus damage increases the more times you go through the envoy cycle so unless your side is totally asleep and gets wiped every time they invade they still don't have enough time to swing it. Even while they take advantage of all the "catch up" glowing enemies and power ammo they've been able to farm off cooldown.
---
I was in a match with randoms and we still beat a coordinated team trying to do this stupid thing easily. But maybe it works every so often and it probably lets you invade with more supers/power weapons so you can get more kills? I think it should just forfeit the match if they literally never pick up a mote for the first half of the game but whatever, let the cheesers try if they must.
---
I know but i would fit with the Colors
---
any non legendary or higher gear you cant infuse
---
I saw one for R6 and wanted to make one for Destiny, didn’t know if it was a trend or not
---
Nope, i yeeted the god damn controller because i was very, i repeat very mad
---
Thundercrash has its (limited) uses. I mainly use it as a gimmick for fun, but it was quite good in Crown of Sorrows, one shotting ogres along side Golden Guns. With Bubble back, Thundercrash needs a pinpoint damage buff to give Titans a one shot DPS super for bosses. Nothing Nighthawish, but an exotic that gives more damage, and maybe a defensive capability since we will be right in the boss's face, would be nice. Limit flight time or control or something, but I would definitely like to see a buff for PvE at least.
---
Definitely, but I feel like what most distinguishes it and what most defines it is its provision of a competitive PvE experience in a game that otherwise lacks one. It just seems a bit like they undercut the concept by throwing in the PVP element. I say this as a big fan of the Crucible.
---
You sly devil
---
I don't understand why they can't just have a matchmade queue and a private queue at the same time.
---
How can you notice its a wallpaper
---
Never got it
---
But crucible dad it would, it so would and it does
---
This isn't a bungie issue. These people are just straight up cheating. Report them and try to post this to the forums. They need to be banned
---
I do, but I also hate myself
---
it would be cool if the perk was that it gravitates towards enemies when you are riding it, and gives a boost of damage when you hit them.
---
I found mine on earth doing lots of quests and public events
---
Why tho
---
Do my arc hunter with liars handshake?
---
Imagine raging at a raid
---
It really yaba daba do be like that sometimes
---
arc battery and way of the wind
---
There's a quest that explains stuff. And one if those tutorials at the bottom of the screen. People just don't read
---
It's actually pretty simple to get, especially if you're playing comp at that level
---
Rather just have tea
---
As pretty newish player I agree with this. The amount of content in this game especially in the form of "do x thing y times" is mind blowing.
---
Currently at 910 and I'm not certain if I should grind for better (meta) gear or just grind my lvl some more.
---
Nooo
---
Even Rivin was like, “bro, wtf”
---
honestly its more for a shutdown/entry subclass in pvp, plus inertia override is very good in pvp one example is sturm overcharged plus inertia override can 1 shot to the head
---
And do deaths put my score at a negative? So if I die 9 times do I have to survive 12 runs through the full activity
---
"Lifes good"

How I despise people that don’t value their belongings....  no matter how angry I would be I wouldn’t destroy the stuff I payed for.
---
Jotunn is great for those guys they almost one shot them
---
No. Third party app? They are glitchy as hell
---
Kill and invader with a hand cannon before they wollop one of your teammates? Specifically all of that?
---
You can for one more week, brother. I'm kicking everything in the face nonstop until Bungie rips it away from me
---
Shaxx Sexy Legs
---
You have to kill a invader in gambit before they kill your team so get a sniper wait for them to get enough motes and spawn kill them it’s not to difficult
---
Well
---
Technically you only need to stand in the circle to get the buff and then you can move and do DPS anywhere until the buff runs out
---
But I get what you mean.
---
It can’t have sexy tho I’d get reported😂
---
lol only played for like 3 weeks and only found 1, but damn 1 year.. you mustve sinned against RNGesus ;D
---
Pretty sure Eris has it.
---
It’s the destiny app I use.
---
Ope wait I can do shaxxsthiccthighs
---
Well there is but it’s all forsaken(which sucks). The only thing that I can think of, for a bow is Garden of Salvation that drops a bow.
---
I have done that numerous times. Some places I’ve read say it has to be within ten seconds of them invading and I’ve done that. A buddy of mine that got it right before I did was even shocked that I didn’t get it to complete a few times of melting an invader.
---
Kill an invader before they kill a teammate within 5 or 10 seconds of them invading. I forget if it’s 5 or 10 seconds but there is a time limit
---
If video games really make you very very mad, you should get therapy and find a relaxing hobby.
---
Didn't know there was a wallpaper engine that's interesting
---
^this, truth, jotuun, supers. Anything that can instagib when they pop over.
---
Glitchy as hell as well ^^
---
No i think 1 flawless team run and your good
---
For real all of my exotics are from Xur and quests. Xur does provide though 😎 to bad I want the Monte Carlo
---
I’m confused as to what I should be looking at
---
Alright. Thanks for the info
---
Cool
---
*gets 6 rewards*
---
Ha
---
Very nice
---
When you really want to kill that random vex walking around but you don’t have the voltaic buff
---
You need to get the Not on My Watch Medal which can be acquired from killing an invader 5 seconds into their invasion before they kill anyone.
---
Love this ! I dig the center of it all

I still really want Duty Bound... sadly I never can get bbn people to do Savathun's song with me :(

Was he a Collector in Prime? White armor glow? That's the only possible explanation I can think of

I all ready got a hobby, and theres no threapist near where i live and im not going 10 km on a bike
---
It is not very obvious since they don't bother to actually segment their UI in any way. Just a cluster of icons and the middle right just so happens to be the "glory" ones with everything else being "valor". One of the many frustrations I have with their incomprehensible UI design. Took me forever to even figure out what the difference was with Survival and Survival: freelance since the tooltips seem identical.
---
Black armoury comes with new light as well as all the y2 annual pass content
---
Possibly bugged for you then, can only keep trying tho, erianas vow would make it a heap easier too. Not sure what's happening tho, soz
---
This is some sound logic right here.
---
Whaat? Destiny has the best lore I've ever seem by far in any game, and I play a lot of games.
---
Gambit Prime is really simple when you do the following:  Have 1 member farming 5 motes and banking all the time to keep other team busy. Other members Just stack 10 or maybe 15 and bank at the same time all the time. Other than that. Have debuffs, void nades, Tractor Cannon, Moebius Quiver, Titan Bubble etc and, IMPORTANT: Don't kill last primeavel envoy UNTIL INVADER IS DEAD. HUGE MISTAKE RIGHT HERE. If you kill the last primeaval envoy BEFORE the invader, he will farm your asses during boss damage phase.
---
Honestly I get that this doesnt apply for a lot of players. I just think if we provided something a little more for new players (maybe even skippable) that it would make it more approachable and help keep players in the game
---
I miss the farm's football field.
---
Hahaha don't worry it will come together... Best advice I have is to play smart. Almost everything you do can be done while doing something else or vice versa. You can almost always knock out two birds with one stone. As an example, I started destiny 2 on the PS4 after about 1200-1500 hours of gameplay, I switched to the PC. I managed to pass that progress up on the PC after about 500-600 hrs...
---
I gotchu, Middle tree Void walker with a focus on Grenade cool down mods and Contraverse hold exotic gloves. Weaps I like with this are Last Word plus Snipes and choice of heavy!
---
That spot in the EDZ was great. Between the Enemy Moving Against each other a couple of times and that door that spawns a steady stream of dogs, I got the bow kills knocked out fairly quick.
---
IMO paying for someone else to earn you something is stupid but even with the auto load nerf they are both pretty solid weapons
---
I honestly dont remember. I got a masterwork Breakneck and masterwork Truth out of the leveling. One of those maybe?
---
It would be very complicated because equalizing the motion between FOVs is a calculated curve rather than a line, I'm pretty sure and since you can control both the FOV and have a sliding scale of possible zoom levels AND the adustible sensitivity in the first place; it would need a whole bunch of datapoints for a user to plot. 
---
I know for a fact in Battlefield that the "uniform aim" you are used to and prefer is done through an internal algorithm that plots horizontal motion along that FOV curve to make everything "feel" the same (i.e. that moving your mouse X inches always equals your reticle moving Y degrees). I don't think they have the option in destiny yet, your best bet is to find your preferred scope zoom and look for that in your rolls.
---
Like others posters here have said, and I previously, you're romanticising a weapon that you think is amazing when in reality it's just *nice*.
---
I was gonna say more and to into detail but hey, what's the point? Right? You've made your mind up about it so either get it or don't.
---
Insert greatful anime schoolgirl gif here
---
Cayde should stand in the middle
---
Do you ha e the name of the quest? I want to point my friend to it. 
---
Also I get the stuff at the bottom of the screen, but new players sometimes miss that due to action on screen. A quest like activity as a preview would definitely help with making sure it the information is absorbed
---
These have all been amazing!
---
I'm a new light player as well , and I'm overwhelmed by the sheer amout of quest just dump on you , but after some play through the only thing truly matters is the weekly powerful gear quest , after you done grinding all of it for the week then you start worry about exotic and campaign etc .
---
I still love this weapon. Even for a Y1 its rolls aren't bad and its still viable imo
---
Awesome alright again thanks for the info everyone!
---
You have to kill an invader basically as soon as they spawn in. You team mate cannot die to the invader and you have to kill them within a few seconds. 
---
If you aren't getting it then you're not quick enough. It took me a few tries before I got it. 
---
You can also use anything to kill the invader. They just need to die. Hand cannon, heavy ,or sniper..it doesn't matter.
---
I just started playing this game.  I generally bank at 10 when the game starts and at 5 when the portals start opening.  Is that the general recommended way to play the gamemode?
---
Exactly. I have it and it's.. Nice? Fun? But i often choose loaded question over it with a hand cannon or a pulse.  Anyone who complains about not being able to keep up is just not on the same level
---
Who else is participating in this *nice* battle
---
YOUR STRATEGY IS WORKING. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.
---
There might be one at the festival of the lost
---
I guess it wouldn't do any harm.
---
Badass dude nice job
---
I'll punch you dagnabit
---
I would wear that everywhere!!!
---
It is possible to fit any explanation to that term, but in terms of gaming I could not find any older references than one from bf3, as much widespread. Example: `http://www.blueberryville.com/` and bunch of YouTube videos.
---
This is so good man and I’m glad it’s a high res 😂😂
---
Yeah I tend to lean on the more information the better. Most of my friends are fairly new to the game so I even though I've played for a while it's interesting having someone who hasn't played give you the viewpoint of a new player
---
Ez clap
---
Helmet Stays On
---
If you don't understand this then you're missing out.
---
It's the fact that we can only really see her mouth under her hat. I swear, Warframe has mastered this to a science.
---
Cool i’ll try that subreddit, thanks!
---
Yeah, that was kind of the point I was going for. Maybe even having like a practice mode as an option to join so veteran players dont get forced into a new player quest. I know you can make private matches, but maybe something you can play solo
---
It’s not OP’s post
---
Titan? Smash
---
Thanks! I am thinking of doing one for the raids, calus will feature in that one
---
It’s connection based matchmaking
---
Recluse? Buffed.
---
Post on this before. Hit search at the top and type “new light player” and scroll through
---
Hive? Woken.
---
Can someone link this? I cant seem to find it :(
---
Kinderguardian lost 15 motes
---
Kindergaurdian lost 12 motes 
---
Kindergaurdian lost 7 motes

An alley returned with 0 kills

Kindergaurdian lost 10 motes 
---
GOD DAMN YOU KINDERGUARIDAN
---
Thanks for the help!
---
And all this time I still slap the like buttom with joy...
---
Always.
---
My only gripe is that I cannot put mods on it. It would be amazing otherwise.
---
*^(I just want my Purity Seals)*
---
Hunter, Titan or warlock?
---
Any
---
I got it 3 times in a row lol
---
Either your internet or there’s either way lag.
---
There are numerous triumphs that need full armor sets to be worn for particular events, missions, raids. Etc.
---
Keep it going they'll just keep proving you wrong..
---
Mars? War with the cabal.
---
Do that quest
---
We don’t allow giveaways of jacket or any discount code. But I can set up one for the emblem code. Would you like to do it on here or on our discord server?
---
I'll change my name to No U.
---
Ok now 10**
---
Btw it looks awesome man.
---
Yeah, sorry about that, 2500 kills with specific weapons for the undying seal is rough
---
Oh god, rangefinder is good? I've been scrapping everything I get with it. Didn't really think inc range and zoom would be super viable.
---
Wtf is a small rice cake
---
armor requires different materials much more expensive than weapons. wanted to see what was given in return for dismantling
---
That's not true, its just that most of the others aren't as brain dead easy to use
---
foretnyte handgonne
---
Oh yeah I was wondering this all the time. But I wasn't brave enough to try. You are the hero need we need but not the one we deserve. 
---
Guess I'll have to be mindful about spending those valuable Ascendant Shards!
---
You need Forsaken DLC for it
---
If you have it go talk to Ada in the tower, shes in the basement area near drifter for gambit if you know where he is at
---
Why is your profile pic a fortnite skin?
---
The only one I can think of that is guaranteed is the black armory bow spiteful fang, everything else I think of is rng. That's also the fastest
---
In order to shoot an RPG the effective range of an arrow you'd need a bow with about 27,000 pounds of draw weight.
---
Subtle Calamity and Arsenic Bite drop fairly okay on the tangled shore. You can get No Turning Back from Petra during the beginning of Forsaken if you have it, so you can just create a new character, get out of the cosmodrome, and hop right into it. That's what I did. Also a great way to get cabal kills is the Castellum of the Leviathan.
---
Ah that sounds great. Looking forward to it. Was the Menagerie an expansion too?
---
You may think so, but your opinion is still wrong. Have you even tried purple crayons? They've got a certain rich taste that's simply to die for.
---
I would suggest farming heroic events on tangled shore 🤙 seems to have most frequent bow drops
---
Grape flavored Windex? How come I never knew about this? All along I've been drinking blueberry like a peasant.
---
Oof yeah they are RNG drops, i think you just have to get lucky
---
Could’ve sworn that was Omar. Who was the fella that got shanked by his own ghost after crota turned that bad boi into a dagger?
---
Meanwhile my team always has the one that stands by the invasion portal all game waiting. He doesn't know what a mote is and gives no fucks about your primeval annnnnnnd they killed him in seconds welcome back your existence here has been nothing but detrimental.
---
IDK whats more amazing the timing on that Ghost line or that theres actually Hunters out there who don't use Triple Jump.
---
Y’all are forgetting about THE DRIFTERS words of encouragement when you invade that’s where it’s really at
---
I really wanna make a live wallpaper version of this
---
Saw you already got this fixed but for future reference if you ever have a triumph that isn't loading properly (or even quests) you don't have to completely restart the game since sometimes that comes with long load times. Simply changing characters and back will do it. Assuming you have more than one character obviously.
---
It varies depending on the guns. It's good on hand cannons, scout rifles, pulse rifles, and machine guns. (Mainly for PvP on the machine guns) But it's not great for other types. It does take some time to get a feel for what works where, and it'll ultimately come down to whatever playstyle you develop. Just make sure to read your perks, take into account what kind of weapon they're on, and where that weapon fits in to how you play the game.
---
\*lost
---
I mean, yeah, fuck hunters who whine constantly if they're not constantly the most powerful class in the game.
---
A head start on what?
---
PS4
---
Please help lol
---
It was part of season of opulence... Came with the previous annual pass, not sure what its part of now as I had everything already when we moved over to steam
---
SPOOK
---
Militias birthright, especially with ambitious assassin, primary energy of choice and whisper.
---
Supremacy, risk runner and "love and death"
---
Go raid the chests before doing the raid in an attempt of getting useful mods that can be applied to any armor received during the raid...
---
Do it! Let me know what you need and I'll see what I can do
---
Awesome thanks! Couldn’t find something like this anywhere
---
The small rice cake in Destiny 2 is a little treat you give to the Jade Rabbit statues hidden around the Moon. There are several of these statues to find, much the same as the cats in the Dreaming City. And, much like the cats, the Jade Rabbits will give you a reward for your effort.
---
In the mean time, just go to accessibility under options and see what the UPNP port is and forward that one UDP port in your router.  If you have more than one player in your house, hopefully you have different ports there, otherwise only one person at a time can use this fix but until bungie fixes upnp at least you only need this one port forwarded to get open NAT and have a much better online experience.
---
https://imgur.com/rkJJqXL
---
Yeah, I guess so. This incident aside, I wonder why lag is different in this game. Usually gameplay gets noticeably choppy in some games, but Destiny has the smoothest lag. If that makes sense.
---
You might be able to re buy a bow from Petra. You also get a guaranteed one from her from doing the forsaken story quest so worst case scenario you can vault everything on a character and remake them if you went through it on all of yours already. Although I'm not sure how you'd shard that bow all 3 times without realizing it
---
What sparrow is that?
---
I only started playing Destiny 2 today so I actually had no idea triple jumping was a thing until I was just fucking around in my inventory a few hours after this happened hahah
---
https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48357
---
Yeah Idk how to spell it lol
---
The regular taste more like blue raspberry.
---
Just the ghost overlay really and time lol
---
It says greatly increase the nocking speed of arrows that means how quick you ready the next arrow after firing
---
It’s not charge time
---
If they haven't spawned Primeval you'll get a little head start
---
It’s because it’s peer to peer connection.
---
If you're not 2 plating him, don't talk to me or my kids ever again.
---
A dumb question are you on a warlock. B telesto is currently disabled due to a super bug
---
Wait, what the fuck? 
---
This is amazing.
---
Holy shit that looks incredible!
---
Get down Mr. P... Oh.
---
Can someone tell me how to get a bow for the precision kills step, I can’t find one anywhere
---
Outstanding.
---
festival of the lost.its a halloween event,it starts next week
---
Thanks for the pointless reply. Here’s one for you.
---
This is why I gave up on doing Gambit stuff.  The sad thing is, Freelance Survival is the same way.
---
*sweat noises*
---
Thanks.  I probably won't wear it but I need it to add to my vault at least.
---
120
---
Can you make a black hunter background?
---
That’s great
---
See [here.](https://youtu.be/Jb3i8Aov260?t=98)
---
I only do it until I get the kill requirements for the weekly. Then I go back to aiding in taking the boss down. Can’t blame a man for trying to do the offensive only once a week!
---
Shhhh.  Not now.
---
Thanks! I have not been able to find a concrete answer
---
Oh ok! Thanks for answering my silly answers, Its just that i cant find anyone asking, or getting answers
---
 I would like to remake my titan into a female exo. My question is what will I lose and what will carry over? I know powerful and pinnacle rewards will only work on one. But what about quests in progress, triumphs etc. like Randy’s scout rifle progress. Will that carry over?
---
Indeed.
---
Did you fight the giant taken servitor thing? After that that’s it pretty much in the center of the dreaming city there’s that well thing that gives lore and rewards every week that’s it XD byf’s videos will give you some extra lore I think you’ll find interesting
---
Yeah there isn’t much info on it.
---
Bruh that’s sick it looks like warlocks are hive, and titans are cabal but I’m not sure what the hunters are.
---
Thank you man
---
Daily I think, and I'd guess the order they were unlocked in
---
r/fireteams fellow mobile user ♥️
---
Hot leaf juice to be exact.
---
Failing that, the pyramidion on IO
---
In year 1 all warlocks could spam about 30 nova bombs, her character feels equally bland as the blueberry that's in a range of a sniper nest
---
The nation's? No longer in harmony?
---
Lol, I'm using rhetoric to lampshade the bandwagoning of those complaints on this subreddit.
---
Might just be because you get Hard Truths from crucible drops, so people who play crucible a lot probably got a well-rolled HT at some point.
---
“Tell them to line up faster!”
---
hmm... dunno then, that's how he got it.. Maybe also be 900 Power Level and up?
---
I haven't played in a while. How do you turn events heroic?
---
Sylok? the defiled.
---
Yeetuneer
---
If you come across any smg with the genesis trait its worth trying out in pvp. My best pvp weapon is hero's burden with genesis and snap shot sights. I have recluse and it stays in the vault.
---
destiny sucks
---
I have no idea at this point ☹️. I got mine last season from a Y1 engram. Idk how it would happen now 😞
---
So, I am pretty new to destiny 2. Only a new light atm. Probably going to buy the dlc's when they go on sale. I kind of want to know how to you got your grenades to recharge that fast. I love the trip mine and this seems super fun.
---
General iroh would like to have a word with you.
---
Earth shaking machinery? Concentration shattering.
---
Pretty awesome!
---
Exotics take 3 shards to masterwork and you only get one back
---
So this week she has the Blood runner which was previously avaible for silver but now is for bright dust this week. (For some reason she has it in both bright dust sections which is lame) and don't let Reddit users get to you. Letting you know what's up instead of downvoting you with no explanation helps no one.
---
They might be talking about the undying seal triumph where you need 100 precision bow kills.
---
Oh... Wasn't aware that it took three. That's ridiculous.
---
Ya it's honestly a little strong in comp. I wiped teams multiple rounds today using it. You can counter it but the full draw doesn't lose accuracy that quck v
---
Alright thank you
---
I saw it here man. Apparently confirmed by Bungie’s social media manager, too.
---
https://twitter.com/shaxxdrunk/status/1187078998121177094?s=21
---
I NEED MORE OF THIS. OMFG
---
Side note, apparently if you didn't have the quest Rekindle the Flames before Shadowkeep launched you won't be able to currently obtain Izanagi.  It's a bug?  This is just what I heard, I'm not sure how true it is.
---
I've heard you have a higher chance for the Nightmare-specific armor mods to drop. Maybe better chances for higher-tier loot, but as for whether it's worth the extra headache; can't say
---
Question about doing the first three parts. Are those steps time gated? Or can I do them all in one day?
---
I love that you can see the scotch tape
---
Right in the feels bro.
---
bro 😎💪
---
can i get a link ?
---
"Shut up, cracker."
---
Please don't be silver only :(
---
A few weeks of the strikes playlist so far. I have no idea what's going on. But it's my first FPS, so I'm learning as I go.
---
&gt;Festival of the Lost beginning on October 29 and concluding on November 19
---
\-and I will be completely unable to play from 10/29-11/13 because of work....
---
Is that a mountain top
---
You missed the point behind the bit. Just pretend they didn't mean to have it happen and that way you don't have to waste time being angry at anonymous digital people that you never interact with further. Instead you can go down a mental rabbit hole that ends in reconcilliation and, indeed, pity.
---
Me and my friends throwing hammers at the enemies
---
so, 900 is the soft cap of light level, meaning doing almost anything at all will push you to 900.  Completing bounties for vendors will usually give you their currency to exchange for gear.  Once you reach 900 you will want to push for prime engrams and powerful gear drops from the  tower vendors.  Your map will indicate a blue icon for those which offer powerful gear rewards.  These reset weekly.
---
Activities outside of bounties include nightfall strikes, crucible, and gambit.
---
Generally just playing the game, having fun and completing activities will take you above 900 really quickly.  But once at 900 you will need to coordinate your time in game to acquire powerful gear drops.  
---
\-edit  
---
Almost forgot to mention that you always want to keep your highest power gear on your character, as the formula for rewards is based on your maximum possible gear.  If you have a piece of armor at say 860 that has better stats than one at 862, but you dont want to waste resources upgrading your 860 piece, then at least leave the 862 piece in your inventory on character so it helps count towards loot score.
---
And by random they mean the same useless mod over and over.
---
Black armory schematics? Dismantle black armory weapons.
---
The new chitin one that is being sold.
---
Ohhh gotcha. Yeah in the open patrol areas that notification will pop up, it’s just a name of an enemy hover bike thing. They’re hella fun to use! Welcome to the community tho, if you have any questions feel free to dm me on here, I love helping Kinderguardians out
---
I love the community in this game. Vanguard strikes have people posing at every opportunity and even Crucible has the occasional emote before death.
---
Worth looking up for the flashpoint planet each week.  Heroic public events give about 20% iirc.
---
Until he leaves us for Cayde...
---
If no one complained when it came to anything to do with games nothing would change, For example if no one complained about an op gun it wouldnt get a nerf &amp; it would ruin the game, just going by your logic all games would die quickly but im guessing you dont play much at all &amp; you're sort of doing what you're accusing me of doing.
---
Will he smash? No.
---
And so shall your hatred be your sword
---
Should remove zavala and put saladin or shaxx, zavala is a bitch bag
---
Wait...  it was silver last week.. like real money. And this week is “free” with bright dust????  Wtf I hope I’m reading this wrong or how are people not lighting bungie up for this..
---
Reminds me of Evangelion tbh
---
Leviathans breath let’s you run a sole survivor or tranquility which do really good dps and leviathans breath can be a work horse heavy.
---
Swatted like a fly

Except you can't change other people, you can only change yourself. Into a rooster.

lost sector bosses? I thought that's what celestial nighthawk was for...
---
I’ve seen this raw strength only once before...

You good?
---
R.I.P to the best robot lad in gaming history
---
Banning and penalties should be a thing in pvp, like most of the popular pvp games, not that this game is mainly pvp but there is still pvp &amp; its a big part of it.
---
They still haven't fixed it? I've stopped playing the game. They're focusing on nerfing loot and builds than fixing the actual game. The way I got around it was joining a friend to get them to that point and playing through the mission with them.
---
Does Banshee really not know he’s dead? What’s the story behind that lol I’m curious. I thought the last line of the quest text was super weird when I saw it yesterday.
---
55-60 ideally is safe to keep and masterwork. Though gear can drop at 67.
---
Yep next week
---
Warlock was a buddy of mine, he wanted the shoutout
---
EDIT:
---
I also made sure no one’s full GT was visible except for his.
---
The part with the Dragon.
---
You think they hate warlocks  because  i try to find good looking gear and there isnt :/
---
Sweatcicle did the math, and it very well could be impossible to hit 960 light without an artifact
---
100 hours in and still haven't finished a single raid :(
---
Got to phase 3/4 on two raids but didn't manage to complete it fully...
---
You lose the buff as soon as someone else shoots it so it wouldn't work i think
---
Warlocks look like clowns with most of the armor/ornaments these days, specially those helmets, ugh.
---
I didn’t even know that they changed it.
---
You'll get boring robes #42, take it or leave it
---
Hows this Destiny related besides the reaction
---
He is speaking the language of the gods
---
If this was two titans you just fast shoulder charge zooms that whiff and a couple of slams lol. I should know I experienced it myself
---
What armor are you trying to get?
---
Bungie hates Warlocks indeed.
---
Hunters are their focus :(
---
These are cool and all, but I really wanted to finally get my hands on the warlock set from the previous year : (
---
saaaaame. Was my first D2 raid as well.
---
Warlock, void subclass. Honestly grenade abilities are awful, supers other than slova are awful and melee range is a joke. I hate putting myself through shit just to have a drooling titan OEM ape one punch me and then tell me to get good on reddit.
---
That doesn't look too good imo.
---
However, I have seen great warlocks in r/DestinyFashion
---
Feels bad
---
And this is the reason I'm still under 910 power
---
My clannie is at 90 runs of SotP. No anarchy.
---
I'd rather it be like this than a chance thing
---
Damn, with this big of a projector I need some popcorn.
---
This picture has been photoshopped BUT there was a friendly harpy in the failsafe nessus introduction quest!
---
The rust and shit on the edge looks kinda... weird, I think this would look much better if replaced with a dark red vignette.
---
That was a lie made up by Clovis to hide the real reason they were resetting Exos. They were using them for “dirty jobs” and rebooted them to keep them from spilling their secrets, or rebooted them if they learned too much.
---
I'm meaning gear level without artifact. Do I need more than 950 gear light level?
---
The only bounties I have are on my main. Even when I have bounties available on my main, I still don't have any available for the alts.
---
I figured it out. It doesnt count in the medals:]
---
Yeah, I feel like Warlocks aren't that great for PvP anymore. Having a healing well is great but compared to stuff like one-hit shoulder charge, dodging and invisibility I feel like most Warlock abilities are pretty underwhelming, which really sucks as it's always been my favourite class.
---
You don't need to I would just get it paddively
---
The only sources that can drop gear above 950 are the ones labeled pinnacle gear. However, they will only drop 950+ gear if you already have at least one piece of 950 gear in every slot. Once you do have 950 gear, they will drop gear at 951, until you have 951 in every slot, upon which they will drop 952 gear, and so on. It is kind of ridiculous.
---
Note that you don't need to have the gear equipped, but it does have to be in your inventory, not your vault.
---
Banshee is such a FUCKING SWEETHEART!! He sounds like a gruff intimidating guy but the more of his dialogue you hear, the more you realize he’s just a god damn sweet guy.
---
He never says a bad word to anyone.
---
I'm on ps4 and it takes but bit but I can always find people for raids in d1
---
Is there any other shader like it because it ruined my Titan as well
---
I definitely need a better cpu then. Tried it myself but the capture frames are like 40 FPS
---
I laughed so hard I started crying
---
Reddy for gombot
---
Drifter has a line saying "shaxx doesnt need to know about gambit ok?" Or somethin like that
---
Some exotics can have shaders applied like shards of galanor and one eyed mask. I'm not saying all exotic armor (never weapons) because I'm not that experienced, but it probably is all of or almost all of them.
---
TLDR need cliff notes for your reply
---
Ha oh well I guess vex milk is better then any milk she could of had . To the waterfall we go .
---
Waaaah
---
Filthy casual PvP player here, but what's the deal with using blue gear in PvP?
---
The warlock cheese for Crotas End was pretty bad ass.
---
If you finish it it should stay in your inventory forever until you turn it in.
---
ok buddy drifter
---
I found a fellow guardian. She was the worst.
---
"hurr durr a whole dlc and raid just launched but this game fuckin sucks cause it's got the same play mode for a 3 week event as last year" 
---
give the devs a break and grow up
---
But punching is the best offense who needs bullets?
---
No, I just wasn’t high enough light to do it till the last day
---
Honestly sounds like your fireteam just lacks a general understanding of the mechanics because this is by far one of the easiest boss to kill. 
---
My clan has cleared it many times over already and have sherpaed many new raiders from our clan.
---
NP share it foward!
---
Unpopular opinion: I don’t care for the armor ornaments. It looks like something you would find in a Walmart discount costume section 10 days after Halloween ended. 
---
The Auto rifle however looks great and I will grind for it for sure.
---
Grind activities on the moon and do the essence quests at the lectern

Every class has 3 specializations. Solar (fire), Void (dark energy?) and lighting.
---
Solar abilites are the abilities in "fire" tree - granades, melee and the last skill

As soon as someone invades, take note of where your teammates are standing. 9 times out of 10 the invader will spawn farthest away from you and your team. So by process of elimination you’ll be able to figure out where they spawn. Once you know where they are you can make a few decisions. Are they using heavy? Stay back. Is a teammate fighting him? Back him up. Even if he dies you might be able to revive him rendering the invaders efforts useless. Do you have 10 or more motes? RUN! RUN AND HIDE! They will do everything in their power to kill you. They could wipe your teammate but if gets sent back and you still have your 15 motes he will be kicking himself. Nothing make an invader angrier than having to deal with the Taken Knight that’s about to spawn. Are you way ahead? You can wait him out. Not fighting is a choice. Sometimes invaders invade just to kill you to waste your time. You manage to live through his whole invade you haven’t lost much. Running back to the fight from your spawn is time wasted. Hope this helps. Now go do it again!

Lady Efrifeet wants to know your location.

I guess this raid would be the "bad" one for you. CoS did me in real hard too. Come back to it after a while and run with people who have built up good experience in the raid. Or join a good sherpa to get it done eventually. But for the mo, just so something else. Raid is not going anywhere.

What do I need to do to craft Bygones in Black Forge? 
---
Do I need both blue gambit bounty from Ada (kill 2 mvp targets) + pulse rifle schematic?
---
Part of Destiny is the secrets and discovering them. Do not make Bungie feed new players with a spoon.
---
Holy shit dude chill out, talk about fucking baggage jesus
---
As awesome as that sounds, if that gun 1 shot like that everyone and their decrepid grandmothers would be running that gun.
---
Hey! I just got this today
---
Yup. It hurts so good. I get depressed when they pop up and hit an edge and proceed to bounce off the map.
---
Gold thank you bro ✌
---
When 7empest comes in with that intro i know it's going to be a good ride. Ticks and leechees sets me on doom guy mode for crucible too.
---
Fair. Maybe give us 6 shots to start with so we can proc the first shot with the bonus dmg?
---
E: as in more shots to carry the first glance proc
---
I was worried because I had completed all the essence quests. I see now I can purchase them for phantasmal cores. Well back to grinding!

It's not like anything in destiny really makes sense anyway lol
---
Aww man you missed out. That shit leveled me so fast
---
They will probably be 950 depending on the activity you are doing
---
You are correct. I didn’t mean to generalize all raiders wanting to do a fast/quick run with skilled people so it doesn’t take all night, I totally get that it’s just far too often I run into the few bad groups of people with no patience and this ends up ruining everyone else’s reputation
---
But then it was all just a nightmare
