Talk to the drifter 
---
Go talk to the drifter!
---
Talk to the Drifter. Make sure your pursuits tab is not full, and don't delete the quest! 
---
Pretty sure Ana does the exact opposite of what the Vanguard asks...just saying

Defies Zavala at every turn, goes against their wishes and seeks info about her past life, only works with them because she needs our help to yeet Xol, etc.

---
yes, Doctor!
---
It‚Äôs not been obtained. And from what people are speculating it‚Äôs tied to tier 3 or the nine bounties

are we gonna talk about the fact that you lost 17 motes and did 0 primeval damage

Yo how you do this I'm gonna be speed running nightfalls like that XD
---
Haven‚Äôt trace rifles always been in the special slot? 
---
With the recent buffs both got, they've become more popular, at least on Xbox. I see a lot of people using them for EP, Blind Well, Strikes/Nightfall, and Gambit/Prime/Reckoning.
---
Also, they fixed so that Auto Rifle armor perks affect Trace Rifles. So with Reserves, Scavenger, Targeting, Reload, and Special Ammo finder, you can have a pretty efficient loadout. 
---
That's a question with a complicated answer...  
---
For one, I think he does genuinely want to save humanity, but he's very...apathetic about it. Or at least he refuses to let things affect him. The developer who writes his dialogue confirmed that the Drifter does not love our Guardian (referencing the "You wish for love and support" wish that summons him in Last Wish), but loves what they do for him. But newer lore confirms he goes genuinely feel grief for the people who died for/because of him. Overall, I think he's a character who has a mission and refuses to let his emotions get in the way.   
---
So I think the simplest answer is "morally grey." It's worth noting that in Bungie's writing there's very little black and white. Sure, there are characters who are morally upstanding because they want to be (like Zavala or post-H2 Arbiter) and characters who don't give a shit about anyone but themselves (like Mara or the Prophet of Truth) but otherwise you'll very rarely find a character who's strictly good or evil. Bungie is very keen on putting a lot beneath the surface, *especially* when it comes to the topic of morality.   
---
I'm explaining this because a lot of people ask if characters like Calus or Drifter are "good or evil" and I think they need to understand a Bungie's writing is never that simple. 
---
If you picked drifter you can‚Äôt complete it. It said that in the list of stuff when you picked sides. 
---
Can‚Äôt unseen this
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure she could hold her own in crucible too, with Luna(NF)/DRB/Coil as her loadout. 
---
Last word extremely good in pvp adds nothing to pve. Thorn pretty good in pvp not as good as i think it should be and has a bit of use in pve due to overpenetration and DoT. Overall technically id go with thorn as its pretty alright in pvp and pve. But im still sticking with the last word.
---
You have no idea how much better it will be on pc
---
This gun makes no sense to me. Its so inconsistent. I've had it turn 90 degrees to kill a midair enemy, swerve around an enemy to hit the wall, and sometimes just not track at all. Teach me your secrets to make it work properly.
---
Nice

---
Me during Malfeasance, Izanagis Burden, and soon Thorn. Still haven't beaten the Izanagi one 
---
Here we go, posts about acquiring Thorn.
---
Played with your daughter in gambit earlier, wouldn't stop quad killing the enemy team. Kinda felt bad when she melted the primeval when the enemy team hadn't banked a single mote
---
i'm sure bakengangsta switches his super, my dude
---
Shin Malphur is definitely not his arch-enemy. If anything the two are in cahoots with the intent of killing shadows.
---
It's the adventure on titan you have to do for the allegiance quest. It's an old adventure with a tiny bit of new voice acting.
---
i mean the last word isn‚Äôt practical in PvE but it‚Äôs still viable 
---
Calling 10 hours a "grind"  
---
Amusing  
---
Ok ok, stop these posts
---
I have something much worse...
---
Unbroken and telesto
---
Every time the drifter finishes he sentences he ends it with. Trust.
---
No disrespect, but Drifter was a Dredgen... he ran WITH the Shadows of Yor... He openly states that there is a renegade guardian hunting some of his associates 
---
Please give me upvotes and silvers because I made a screenshot of Thorn.
---
Space Hitler.
---
Yeah but all weapons are hell i havent replaced it since i got it but im not going to pretend its good for pve. Cause it is a crutch at times when i play gambit prime when i know i should be using the coil.
---
You gotta finsish the introductry quest it looks like an orange gambit medallion.
---
Amusing console gameplay, eh?
---
Welcome to the common playerbase.
---
Shoot the enemy.
---
I love coldheart for Gambit. It's a mini chaos reach for boss burning. 
---
Just hit them with the Tether, and fry 'em up.
---
soooo the Hawkmoon can't be a hard hitting Solar HC beeecaaaause... why?
---
You just now thought of that? It should be a heavy. And next time try killing all four of them without an exotic weapon 
---
it didnt show up to my hunter, so i went to my warlock and it showed up.  \~ 
---
Chose Vanguard with my warlock, when I run my titian trough going Drifter with him
---
Headshots matter more than they did before with Ikelos or TL, but same strat still works fine
---
Oh yea that was scetchy af 
---
Then you are trash
---
[MyNameIsByf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDUMXgiuYiU) \~ the best way to get lore/story that's not so obvious. 
---
Thorn and The Last Word are two infamous exotic weapons. This is the complete story &amp; lore of their rivalry, of the guardians that wielded them, of Dredgen Yor and Shin Malphur; The Gunslinger! 
---
A desert eagle like side arm exotic or legendary or even both would be perfect, really tired of hand cannons and I want some more side arms.
---
That warlock should have killed you, hes raging so hard
---
I got mine grinding for thorn if that helps 
---
Oh ok thx man 
---
Because it doesn't make sense for hawkmoon to be an energy weapon, and besides, Luna + Hawkmoon wouldn't be dominant in the slightest due to the lack of a special weapon
---
Arbalest is a linear fusion rifle? Damn I need to get it then.
---
Such a lonely life. T_T
---
problem is, no one knows how to get it yet
---
how does it not make sense? Solar is the one usually affiliated with raw destructive power. it's a serious question but you're not giving a justifiable answer bro.
---
crucible isn't a serious game mode, hence why there's no competitive crucible esport league. crucible is there to make people salty, that's about it.
---
Because Hawkmoon doesn't *feel* like an energy weapon, it feels like you're launching an actual bullet out of a cannon, not energy out of a gun
---
Drifter. His side includes another famous guardian as an ally, who would likely turn on the Drifter if he tried to sell us out. With failure protection like that, learning to understand and wield the darkness will lead inevitably to the discovery of some weakness or a possibly a way to achieve balance between the two. Ulan-Tan was right.
---
I mean the roaming supers that never end. That fist of panic. Oh, and let‚Äôs not forget nova warp. You can watch golden gun drain away like shit through a tin horn, but some of the others? Like the Energizer Bunny. 
---
Wheres Dredgen Yor found The Last Word

As a Reaper, I pick up what collector can't, which is less than 5 per lane, usually.

It's a hard gun to get locked behind content that's hard to do.
---
At least we have a ton of void weapons and all handcannons count this time around. 
---
It's alright IMO but not great. 
---
I guess I'm the odd ball. My Titan, Hunter and Warlock are all ride or die with big daddy Drifter. I never liked Vanguard. 
---
so? that doesn't mean it can't be an elemental weapon, look at Whisper of The Worm for example or Chaperone back in D1.
---
To be fair, her messages leading up to the release of the quest made her out to be an over-zealous maniac with a dash of murderer on the side.
---
Can someone make a hd android wallpaper of this?
---
I had to solo the Izanami one and was fucking ready to smash my computer because I kept getting Psion stomped off the map in the boss fight. I‚Äôm not looking forwards to Izanagi or Thorn‚Äôs 
---
Either way though not everyone is good in the crucible.
---
P.s. can you use void weapons like rifles?
---
You can get the super to cancel, but I haven‚Äôt been able to launch myself any notable distance with it yet
---
She rips through bosses as well. I have the malfeasance and I replaced that with the thorn.

believe it or not I *actually* suggested that a few months ago!

Niiiicceee...
---
Any void weapon works and any hand cannon works. The trick is a void hand cannon will give you more progress per kill than say a solar hand cannon or a void pulse.
---
You can, as long as it's void. 
---
Not everyone will get this gun, though. A buy-in to a game like this is not a free ticket to all of the content without some amount of effort. 
---
You may remember the 2015 stat that in Destiny 1, only \~20% of players ever even completed a raid. This is basically that, but for PvP.
---
I love it, i love all this banter and shit haha
---
Ana and Petra woooo
---
Like what?!??!? Drop some quotes! Please and thank you 
---
Terrible activity
---
It‚Äôs at least 200 with the Ikelos hand cannon in non comp/iron banner play list.
---
Hahaha have fun and be safe out there. Thorn wont treat you wrong as long as you give her respect lol.
---
Quest progress, yes.
---
Loot, no.
---
Macro or fast hands?
---
It honestly gets me going a little bit 
---
After what I had to do to get this gun it's being treated as a flipping god.
---
Laughed so hard!
---
I agree. Hydra should not stomp.  
---
Minotaurs and cabal i am fine with because they are big ass dudes.   
---
 It is funny seeing skinny Fallen use stomp when they are suppose to be all tech savvy.  
---
Hive ogre could grab (2)players and force teammates to shoot a "crit" spot on the hand to free their buddies!
---
Because you're guardian is less then ten years old
---
Ikora all day!
---
Fast hands. F, scroll wheel back, F, scroll wheel back, F, scroll wheel back. I can post a video as proof if you need. 
---
I love my Coldheart for Gambit and sometimes Strikes. Got the catalyst done too. It really does melt the tougher guys. And it's great for breaking down those tough shields.
---
I just have super, 150ms delay, switch weapon binded to an unused key, which gives me both speed and control along with reliability. it's a lot of fun to use in things like riven cheese
---
honestly the thorn quest will be easier to get than the last word but it might take more time. Good luck the gun is very fun
---
Does Z ever mention anything about being there? What could explain his ability to be there?
---
#savathun.
---
that‚Äôs right. he is an illusion of the hive god of trickery
---
no no no, this ain't no dredgen, this is one of them there "COD lovers"
---
I've been killed by it a lot already Haha I can't wait! Thanks, man. Have fun.
---
You know you can place a raid banner right?
---
you 2 :) 
---
you 2 :)
---
Sir, would you like to see a doctor? 
---
He more or less says that he showed up to yell at you on Mars for being an idiot, goes back to the tower and says 'oh hey there's a traveler shard over there, go give it to Xol.' 
---
Savathun being Vuvuzela in disguise makes about as much sense tbh.
---
Except the finals words are as I said. That Iktoa trusts her. So she isnt acting without approval and ahes representing the Praxoc Order. So shes not alone
---
I can't wait for a SMG or AR to grind for. In strikes or something like that. Breakneck is the last non-HC I had to grind for and I totally appreciated it. I'm not really into HCs, but I still like to get them. The grind for them always involves Crucible though, and all the try-hards make it really tough for casual players. TLW was a nightmare for me. Ace was fairly easy though. I actually used TLW to get it Haha
---
Y‚Äôall know that little white ball in the ascendant plane is Toland right?
---
Guardian. It is unwise to question the Vangiard's ways. However, whether we wanted it or not we've stepped into a war with the worm god xol. So let's get to reaming your ass about defying me. From what I can gather you came here against my command with the help of Ana Bray. With this big ass warmind we can summon this wimpy Alaskan Bull Worm and break the Hive's grip on Mars.
---
Your one and only,
---
Commander Zavala.
---
Hi. 
---
Malfeasance is still going to be my go-to even after I get the Thorn, if the people talking about the high recoil are correct. Not to mention Thorn doesn't have that sick jade looking ornament.
---
You are very welcome guardian :)
---
could this maybe be due to the fact that everyone generally enjoys PvE, while a select few enjoy PvP?
---
the exact Sparrow drop that prompted this post!
---
Eat it you'll get super powers.
---
How is it fair that people have to put up with them lagging their asses off all over demolishing teams?
---
Midnight coup, duke, retold tale, ikelos hand cannon, ace of spades, bad omens, hammerhead, just to name a few. If you're such a hardcore pve player, u should have atleast a few god roles or curated roles of the weapons I mentioned above. Shotgun aping 100 kills with retold isn't all that complicated, ace is a meme on its own, and now you keep momenti mori when you reload.As for suppers, we have a few really nice ones.As for supers, we have a few nice ones at this current moment. Bottom tree void on titan is really nice, let's you throw out 3 shields total, they really pack a punch and seek people. Nova bomb for warlock with skull of fire ahamkara is quite a thing, nova warp is still quite good aswell, will get you 3 or so kills. For hunters, I think it's safe to say that spectral blades is the way to go. Since you're such a hardcore pve'er, I assume you have a few really nice exotics, like one eyed or so.But none the less, good luck my guy. 
---
Yoooo Shaun the Sheep is the shit

it's not fair to punish those who can't afford better internet. the lag switchers? I totally agree with you on that, but I used to have horrible internet myself so I know how it feels.

Bribe for asher?

happy to help =)

Not sure which is better but I've always preferred the parcel of stardust with slideshot and rampage over any other shotty. 
---
Ana best girl
---
&gt; Shaxx is pansexual .
---

---
Lost you there
---
I mean, he is Awoken. And friends with Techun
---
For general adventuring and strikes I run top tree nova and the ahamkhara skull. For speedruns, I use the worldline zero sword and the transversive steps. 
---
I find that funny since when destiny 1 had major content droughts it was destiny 1 crucible and trials which where keeping it alive on the twitch directory and youtube viewership not the pve content. So that must mean pvp players are a big audience 
---
I also get this gun a lot, though it was worse a month ago, when I was getting like 2 a day.
---
OOOO 
---
we got an anthem boy
---
Perhaps but malfeasance requires Gambo to obtain which is automatically a downside for me
---
Drifter gets executed and the Nine take over Gambit
---
Get what? The drifter' question to side with the Vanguard or him? Complete the introduction quest and after the Reckoning part, he'll need you to visit him, and after he upgrades your synthetizer, he will ask you. I think its a season pass owners only, hopefully not
---
You can choose to go whit drifter or vanguard(but mostly you investigate with aunors help) and if you choose drifter you will be his buddy/crew member, trusted but if you go whit vanguard he doesnt hate you but he calls you snitch (im offended bungie wtf). The decision may affect some future content. Basically you choose to work whit drifter or try to get some information about him which i did i dont trust him but now i do little more.
---
I picked the Vanguard because not only did I not trust him the second he came into the Tower but he‚Äôs possibly part of the Shadows of Yor, I ain‚Äôt messing with that. But the main reason is what he did during the testing of Gambit Prime, permanently killing three Guardians and not feeling any remorse for their deaths.
---
I‚Äôm not doing it for the Vanguard cause I never liked them in the first place, I‚Äôm doing it to spite The Drifter and support the Praxic Order. 
---
Thank god I rage quitted Darksouls a long time ago, otherwise id be really triggered
---
I am happy the other steps have the option to do PvE activities. 
---
So yes clumps of ads and some mini bosses. Sometimes it works on spread out mobs because of the tracking mini bombs. Try it out and have fun. I enjoyed an LMG or Clusters with Heavy Lifting and SoDA before the LMG and Clusters nerf, still effective now but I tend to run 1kv or anarchy as they've been buffed.
---
From what I hear about Malfeasance (I haven't got it yet, just need the invasions!), I hope it gets just a ***little bit*** more of a buff in Gambit towards NPCs.
---
This is a reddit sub i am not going to have a good sentence structure lol. Where did i say that i spoke for the whole pvp community huh ? This season pass barely has any content at all so getting 2 iconic favourite pvp weapons is good enough for now. Now im putting an end to this thread because you should be getting those thorn kills instead of talking to me üë∫üåöüë∫üåöüë∫
---
I'm just starting out. I want to make some progress first and get a good sense of what the heck is going on. Right now it's just a lot to learn. 
---
What are milestones? How does having multiple Guardians help me?
---
Looks great!
---
Now light it on fire.
---
I just pulled out the year one erintil from the collections and used that since I wanted to be lazy 
---
Power up bro ur low level
---
I still have the ace of spades ornament from preordering foresaken with no gun to put it on. Mixing PvP with PvE really screwed me over for something I paid extra for.
---
Tried that for all three characters multiple times with no luck
---
I love how Bungie is making things less black and white in the world of Destiny. Sure, it can get confusing, but it's also very interesting.
---
Do you lose your mote on tier two? If u fail
---
I get you but the last word and thorn were super requested. Ace was good . And until forsaken there were only 2 hand cannons
---
On console, kindled Orchid is horrible 
---
Lol what a turn around. From insulting to saving face. You're putting an end to this? Lol k
---
Also, I didnt realize that just because you were on reddit that it was an excuse to not type correctly. 
---
I was about to comment that she was on par with the average skill of blueberries I'm paired with, but then I realised she banks about 5 motes everytime and I appreciate that.
---
At last, we have become the fastest class &gt;:}
---
well it is for me since i like to type fast and get it over with now bye 
---
yes but now I think they need a break from making HCs
---
don't get me wrong, if you're gonna make TLW return so should Thorn.
---
Lol thought you ended it with the last one? What's gives? Are you not a man of your word?
---
so instead you just blade barrage skate the rest of the track
---
Just get it over with and send me the virus link...
---
They probably wont make any more at least for a while. Malphesence was the only "too far" one but I love it all the same.
---
It would be kind of neat if it got an additional buff in Gambit besides Taken Predator, though that'd probably still be pretty good combined with the Sentry armor set in Gambit Prime since you want to clear the Taken blockers.
---
Good grief
---
I think a Rapid Hit perk that activates on taken would be brilliant
---
o7
---
Aunor is girl btw. I made the same mistake. 
---
My Ikelos_HC is finally meta?!
---
I wanted to join, just to see, but did not want to risk being called an N-word. Like no thank you, deal with that enough already at work from dementia and Alzheimer patients.
---
You really need to utilize the damage bonus on the knights. I played my reckoning tier 2 this week with all randoms. Our light levels were 666, 671, 668, and another 660 something. We blew right through it 3 times in less then a half hour. It's really easy with a decent build and using what the game gives you. Also don't forget those raid banners in the beginning!
---
HEEEELLL
---
u r runnin' on the blade, bro. 
---
ada 1. only ada 1.
---
Not just on console. I can not like my kill clip / rampage Orchid no matter how hard I try.
---
What holds you from getting Ace? 
---
For real. Even says it in description of quest 
---
excuse me, what do you mean with "arbitrary playstyles"?
---
I fell in love with that hand Cannon all over again 
---
I would rather this than them all trying to save for 10 or 15 and then getting invaded and all dying with them.
---
I got it from Golden Gunning an invader in the first 3 seconds, bcus that a medal apparently, but I think it's tied to anything sentry, and it's random.
---
I can pretty much only use 180 HC for crucible 
---
It is. I was scrub as well when I began with pvp and ladt season I got Luna and were going for NF this one.  Try to find some friends to start learning, its way more fun. To be good in pvp, you have to play it and learn from mistakes. Watch some youtube videos, to see what is meta and what gear you should use. Play safe, stick together. Hold those corners. Its a lot to take in but dont let defeats discourage you. 
---
Not all loot is bankable
---
Youll also lose the unlocked supers having to reaquire seeds of light.
---
Make sure you take all your gear off. Anything you have equipped will be lost.
---
You might want to just keep it around and delete another character, since you don't play on them it might be smart to keep your 50 around 
---
...
---
Same here, I just used Graviton Lance and stacked up those multikills 
---
&gt; high impact short range Sidearm with high recoil basically a Desert Eagle
---
So.. a handcannon?
---
oh you know the whole business with void hand cannons. Everyone and their brother is running around with ikelos‚Äô and such usually with void subclasses too. You gotta choose between using weapons you like and efficiently getting progress
---
google has been super useless on this answer
---
My killer queen has already touched Zavala 
---
Yes, so if you shoot him with it you're obligated to tell him to stop hitting himself.
---
For real though. Ive never had a problem obtaining any shader or skin. If you just play you get most of the stuff you want. Regarding silver only skins.. Those are okay i guess? There arnt that many and only for specific guns. I didnt buy any of them and i dont plan on doing so.
---
Just walk around with your ghost up. He will look in the direction of the computers if you're close. Was more useful than I expected.
---
J√∏tunn for the ogres and the knights, Hammerhead, and Tether for the scritchy scratchy bois.
---
I'm enjoying all of the ikelos users, it's a refreshing change of pace from hearing the *pew pew guardian down*of lunas and not forgotten.
---
I finished the thorn strike at 2am this morning, can't wait to play pvp later with itüòç
---
Sure. But I still want more exotic hand-cannons. 
---
I‚Äôm sorry, but I love them so much. I‚Äôm addicted. 
---
You comment is irrelevant both to post and my comment.
---
Honestly this is a super simple look due to having two forsaken armor pieces which most people will probably have.  
---
Shader on all armor: New Age Black Armory
---
Gun Shader: Dreaming Spectrum
---
Cloak: Neotaric Kiyot Cloak
---
Headgear: Celestial Nighthawk
---
Gauntlets: Neotaric Kiyot Gauntlets
---
Chest: Prodigal Vest
---
Leg: Prodigal Strides
---
I'm on that step now. I want to commit suicide.
---
Haven't played Destiny 2 in a few months, why are people using this handcannon? 
---
Last time i checked it was pretty bad...
---
Gambit reaper armour: for the ‚Äúrapidly defeat multiple combatants drops special ammo‚Äù, how many enemies do we minimally need to kill?
---
If you play rumble it'll finish real quick, ace of spades comparably has a really easy PvP step. 
---
Im gonna lean myself out of the window and say the drifter is only relevant because its the season of the drifter. 
---
He came and he will go away again.
---
But the vanguard will always have importance.
---
Counterbalance stock time
---
What do you have to do
---
Yep. Slapped that bad boy right on!
---
Get to 2100 Glory(Fabled)
---
Thanks man i hope rngesus blesses me today
---
Am I the only one that hopes that eventually they'll have all three envoys spawn at once rather than 2 then the third? I find it incredibly difficult to come back with that stupid mechanic when I've came back from something similar to regular gambit.
---
As a solo player myself, I do not think that the ‚Äúpros‚Äù on YouTube know REAL challenge until they do everything by themselves 
---
Ya I'm well over 50 keys now can't get it either. Somehow I actually got anarchy yesterday after 30+ runs...believe they said they're going to be addressing the 1kv drops in an upcoming patch
---
Damn didn‚Äôt know that this meme is from JoJo.
---
Idk but I read doing enough damage to the invader marks him for the whole team
---
TWAB MOTW stuff right here
---
Well.. sometimes the architects happen.
---
Ahh that kinda sucks especially if the invader finds everyother teammate before you.
---
You don't have to do it in comp, i've been doing it in regular crucible.
---
Im about 80% done after about a day and a half.
---
It only states that Comp is faster, it forgets to mention that a lot of comp players are gods.
---
Void hand cannon, in comp, one kill is around 1% (ish) and comp is fun because everyone is grinding thorn. 
---
Just do rumble if talking about the thorn quest, it'll go alot quicker esp if you're getting alot of countdown in comp, plus the bad connection isn't fun for anyone 
---
I mean it ain‚Äôt to bad, I don‚Äôt have the set yet but I wanna run sentry so I‚Äôve been staying at the bank anyways, usually your team is all in one third of the map, along with enemies, it‚Äôs easy to find the invader a lot of times because it‚Äôll ping on your radar where no other enemy or team mate is, I just hope it‚Äôs any damage and not a significant amount 
---
I'm talking about regular crucible lol, this has just made me more depressed
---
It's been pretty consistent with all hand canons imo
---
Yes
---
It really did, it‚Äôs so pretty to look at

‚Äî3 seconds later‚Äî
---
BOOOOOOOM!!!!
---
‚ÄùBlueberry lost 15 motes‚Äù
---
Yea both versions have their ups and downs.
---
You on console or pc?
---
I did Tom Berenger forge earlier today hoping to get Jotun, but instead I got Tractor Cannon. 
---
We‚Äôve all been there, brother 
---
My favourite will always be the tractor cannon &lt;3
---
My hunter creeps through the wilder lands, surviving on slain animals and excrement of alien deer. He awaits the sun to shine and the war to end. I await a mate to join me on my Everquest into the abyss. I put on my robe and wizard hat, as my pants drop to my knees and I grasp my Peter firmly, gazing into the distance.
---
Im reporting you to the police thats rape.
---
They buffed the droprate. Finally.
---
Get fucked.
---
Honestly, I have thorn and its not great, its better for PVE than PVP and its nor great there either. Last word or Ace beats it by far, and I dont have malfeasance yet so I cant give my opinion there
---
Blueberry has upgraded to Strawberry 
---
Fuck you.
---
*unzips your penis*
---
Lol funnly enough i had a far easier time today in comp with this quest then i did quickplay, quickplay was just a mess today last words and orchids with ace of spades everywhere.  
---
A whole year dedicated to something they‚Äôve no interest in balancing. How hellish.
---
Hip fire unless you're planning on finishing the job in one shot. The hip fire recoil is minimal, the ADS recoil is huge, and ADS doesn't gain much range in return.

This isn't an LFG sub.

I have done 24 scourge of the past and I haven¬¥t got the anarchy but get this weapon is secondary for me, pure collecting, the thousand voices if it is a weapon that I want to use, we will have to wait for the future patch :(
---
Ok thanks
---
If you say so :)  I just hope I don't get DDosed because I don't want a gambit bann
---
Lol. That‚Äôs pretty funny to do. 
---
That's a case of an acronym being established after the word became popularized. 
---
Meta (metagaming) refers to the state of the game "outside" the game. Essentially, whatever the stat tracking that happens outside of the minute to minute gameplay. 
---
For example, if you were to walk into the riven encounter fresh and blind you would just use your favorite weapons and would be forced to learn the most apparent viable tactic that the game presents to you. However, meta dictates (IE people on reddit, forums, youtube, etc) that everyone bringing a cluster launcher and handling the fight a very specific way is the best way to do it. 
---
Therefore, everyone starts doing it and it becomes the "norm". When things are adapted in this sense they are usually referred to as "metagaming" or "meta" which changes over time especially in multiplayer titles since once a specific playstyle has been popularized oftentimes a counter strategy will reveal itself quickly and the meta will change.
---
Your comment about exotic drops being tied to the number of kills is utter bullshit though.
---
Destiny version of annoying paperclip?
---
Glass half full view: Comp is only toxic if you're on a mic and someone on your team cares about winning (which, normally is the whole POINT of comp, of course). Herding a bunch of blueberries (like me!) farming kills into that playlist will be good for everyone. If it gets too rough the bluebs can always file back into quickplay and/or wait for Iron Banner.
---
Thank you finally someone really gets it 
---
Trials 100% kept a decent playerbase throughout the droughts of PvE content.  Twitch was always popular with Trials streamers and honestly won't ever do numbers like that again until a mode like it is reintroduced.  
---
If you got ddos it wouldn't ban you, just the players doing the dosing. And at low level comp it's full of ikilos hc and primary gameplay rn because everyone is doing the same quest. It's actually not bad. I didn't run into any stacks and only a few duos. You can do it
---
&gt;gwisin vest
---
You are the enemy of the people 
---
No worries! Just thought it might be strange for you to have a multiplier that would be locked at an amount lol
---
Oof. Am I glad I dodged that bullet.
---
Issue I have is that I'm a Warlock who's not gone Nova Warp. So I can't use my super or nades for the progress, which would speed it up ridiculously.
---
And my second character is level 7. Pretty hard to do it on that one.
---
He's right.
---
You don't post someone else's personally-identifiable information.
---
It's witch-hunting.
---
So don't act like you're doing him a favor. 
---
Have cannons were crap in vanilla D2
---
I just want to know what I‚Äôll lose choosing either side, haven‚Äôt seen anybody post a guide to gear or anything like that yet. 
---
Late to the party? Ive still never seen the damn meatball!
---
rampage kill clip orchid dont give a fuck about ikelos hcs
---
The recoils not high just odd its got a recoil direction of 100 which means it should go straight up but it pulls slightly to the right in my experience which leads to more adsing and  more paced shots that being said with soul devourer proced it can 2 tap which is filthy.
---
It‚Äôs a hand drawn piece, but I used an app on my phone to give it the more abstract look. Let me know if you want to see the unedited version.
---
Where does it come from?
---
Sometimes you gotta do stuff you dont enjoy much but there are other who likes it. I bet there are many who doesnt like that you need to do couple rounds of bw even if it feels easy to you. This game has many modes and events and bungie is just trying to give everyone something fun. 
---
Is that Datto‚Äôs Thumbnail?
---
I dunno, but its on my launcher and I'm confused as to why
---
CONGRATS GUARDIAN AND THAT WAS AWESOME BY THE WAY...
---
The problem is not with them existing. The problem is not with their quests. The problem is with them being the headline exotic for the annual pass.
---
They could have just as easily made this the pinnacle weapons for the season in crucible or something, and had a headline exotic quest that didn't focus on PvP so heavily.
---
It's basically punishing for someone who primarily plays PvE content to have the headline exotic for the annual pass be PvP based.
---
They should have either had two headline exotics, one PvP and one pve, or kept with their half-attempt at letting the player choose. They let you choose crucible vs nightfalls for one step. Why not continue that trend?
---
I'm not saying PvP players should get content, but this is the what, 8th exotic hand Cannon, and the third one since forsaken that requires heavy PvP to obtain.
---
The only recent exotic quest that didn't require PvP was Izanagis Burden.
---
&gt; Issue I have is that I'm a Warlock who's not gone Nova Warp. 
---
If you're over 600 light, it's pretty easy to just pub-run Blind Well (esp this week with that being part of the Thorn bounty). Hell, it may be pretty easy regardless of LL since everyone else is 650+. Go get your Seed of Light, get Nova Warp, and kill two birds with one stone.
---
Now, if you're like my wife and you're level 32, then you have to play through all of Forsaken to unlock the Dreaming city first... Which is fun, but you have to kinda enjoy the journey instead of being in a hurry b/c that's a lot of playtime.
---
I like it but theres almost never enough people on Mars to play it.
---
You do have a point, I just think that the crucible can already be excruciating enough sometimes given how many try harder there are, that adding an oddly specific quest step that just so happens to make it easier in the mode known for sweat kinda throws a t-bone into the grind
---
Somehow it remembers me of Serana from Skyrim 
---
Currently it's the only bow I'll use. I just can't get into the bows. Bows, swords, and HCs I tend to avoid because I just can't get into them.
---
NOOOOOOOOOOO I made a similar meme with TLW and Thorn at 2am last night and was waiting for peak time to post :(
---
*laughs in buffed malfeasance*
---
Ikelos you get grinding escalation protocols on Mars which is pretty easy I got mine in less than 2hrs 
---
Spawn rate has gone up wildly in the last couple weeks with recent updates.
---
Awesome, hope you enjoy it!
---
Ok I play hunter and I‚Äôm decent at crucible but I have a warlock friends who‚Äôs abilities arnt being shown because of hunters and titans being the way they are 
---
Just checked your post history and your latest post is legit what i‚Äôm talking about. LOL
---
My K/D is like 0.7 or something and I have both. Just play extremely cautiously. And camp - get to a part of the map where you can‚Äôt really be flanked. I played rumble for last word, and competitive for thorn. 
---
oh man I was dying when the wardcliff wasn't preloaded - very nice though!
---
Whereisxur.com
---
I‚Äôve already jumped across to the balcony above the doorway, across from the Oracle offering. There‚Äôs nothing in there that I can see. 
---
You will lose:
---
Story progress
---
Everything in your pursuits tab for that character
---
All subclass and seed of light progress
---
All faction rankings if you were there for that on that character
---
Basically, not all that much, all the loot you have right now can be vaulted or required from collections, equip a set of white gear and vault everything, hit 50, re equip all your gear, do dreaming city quest and you're basically back up to speed. 
---
May I also advise, if you want to do any raids right now or shattered throne or any of the weekly lockout, do those before deleting your character because your new one will be able to run them again in the same week. 
---
Quick tip for the 15 crystals part: farm the golmuut lost sector. Once you kill the ogre, kill yourself or let the hive kill you; you have a big chance to respawj back at the stairs. Walk back up to the area right where it loads you out of the lost sector and then go back in. It took me under an hour to do this part.
---
Zavala != Vanguard
---
and you‚Äòre salty, sounds fair.
---
You get it back from collections
---
Personally here for the memes and theories. Couldn't give a.shit about karma. I didn't post about it when I got Thorn but I definitely thought about it - then realised everyone and their mother will.have it.by now so no point.
---
I feel like there is a slight superiority complex in this.post. 
---
grab one from your Collections tab 
---
Honestly man, I can only speak for myself. I expect there's a lot of people on here like me (do we all think we're special and unique, or do we all think everyone is just like us? - there's my deep thought for the day) . But I've really only started using reddit recently, so I don't really care about karma (yet?). I make no comment on "the majority".
---
When people post memes, is it karma farming or sharing something that amuses them? Obvious reposts not withstanding... 
---
Cheers 
---
I just got my recluse on PS4 but I teamed up with other players I faced while going solo. We ended up getting the 2100 points in about 4 days of play.
---
Only it doesn't take 45 years to draw, can hit targets behind cover with it's proc, and isn't dependent on firing in a .4sec window. I like lemon but I wish it was better.
---
Let people celebrate their accomplishments like damn you either salty or.someone hurt you recently.
---
Last step for Malfeasance you either need your teammates to wipe the other team 3 times or you need to do it once, for the Army of One medal.
---
Distant Relation, it's a Gambit drop. Highly recommend.
---
Wow you learned to spellcheck. üëçüèª
---
I just recently came back to D2 after playing a bit during launch, so I apologize if this is common knowledge, but what's the glowy effect on your head piece? 
---
Side note: I do this occasionally in Reckoning to push people into the portal. 
---
In hindsight I should have hot-reloaded with my ability so I could have been closer, but it still worked!
---
Check in your collections. If its not in there, then it will confirm whether you have gotten it or not. Also, thin line is pretty easy to find and its void as well.
---
Laughs in any sniper rifle

Thanks man! I thought it looked familiar. Maybe its time to dust mine off. Been using polaris lance since the buff.

This just can't get enough up votes.

I'm glad to see I'm not tripping and that the amount of damage they do just feels disproportionate
---
I have the smg and sniper my mate has sniper and hand cannon. Played 10+ gamea banking 50 and still no hc for me lol
---
Only if Bungie listen to us, only if Bungie isn't Bungie. 
---
that moment when you realize you made a shit post and your only defense is picking on someone‚Äòs spelling (I‚Äòm not even native english). good job moron. 
---
Total agree. Let's not forget destiny's release. The first one was not even that good till taken king and then destiny 2 good but got boring fast the. We got forsaken. So yeah same things different game. 
---
You get the IKELOS handcannon from I believe the first world mission on Mars.
---
*Laughs in Whisper*
---
Ah yes you see you should have been using top tree Goldie if you needed to invade, it truly does make invasions easy
---
I‚Äôm a hunter and I personally think spectral blades need better hit detection but be less overpowered if you get what I‚Äôm saying 
---
Thank you very much. My art is still pretty cartoonish, but not like Spongebob.
---
Oh okay thank you for clarifying :)
---
Oh, I wasn't saying they all give +1, just that it happens sometimes. I've only seen it happen once or twice.
---
Back in D1 we had to do this and getting killed sent your progress back. This is gonna take a bit, but it‚Äôll happen. 
---
Testland
---
Cheater, you used super 
---
That‚Äôs for 675 - everyone in your team had at lease 675 LL?
---
Yeah definitely, especially with that reload time. Rampage sounds exciting but I don‚Äôt have enough billets to make good use of it.
---
I wish that they would go back and touch up some unique Y1 guns in that way. Just upping IKELOS to maybe 11 or 12 would make a world of difference
---
Guess I should've read the Dredgen Lore
---
Hey, if cheating gets results...
---
Welcome to the madhouse that is d2 matchmaking. Time to get myself a fire team...
---
Lol like I have bergusia unlocked on all my characters, fuck that.
---
Cuz face presets 
---
The night before I had only used Scout Rifle and got three of them down, and the final shot I needed for the last Guardian pulled a hair too late and I was zapped back and shot in my own arena. Felt *bad*.
---
Bless Noah Thompson
---
Haha I normally play with friends and we have designated roles so when I go into matchmaking it‚Äôs a nightmare. I can only invade and sentinel my way to so many wins while I have blueberries losing 15 motes to ads 
---
It's the Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy, and you recognize it because it was amazing :D
---
Whats that mission? I dont remember it
---
I have 137 army of ones

7 key frags &gt; Anna &gt; Encrypted Key. Then play 6-8 levels of EP to decrypt it. Apparently you can hold multiple decrypted keys, but only 1 encrypted key \*or\* a stack of key frags. If you have an encrypted key in your bag, any key frags you earn go to the postal droid.
---
First gun used in the clip?
---
I play on PC and I will never get to understand this.
---
No, two of us were 665ish and one was high 670s.
---
You can do it, \*Dredgen\*.
---
the crucible portion of TLW was a joke, I finished it in 2 matches. the Crucible portion for this definitely took longer but was by no means difficult. just do your daily bounties on each character and you'll have it done before reset. 
---
This is old.
---
Same here. I began to realize I kept seeing the same tactics because they work. They are effective. At first I tried to emulate others but failed and failed until I found the rhythm. 
---
This is a place for dirty tricks and wrecking shop. If you want honorable combat, go talk to Shaxx. Gambit is a street right, Crucible is a boxing match. Play unfair until you inspire another to do the same. 
---
There is no "fast" way really - finish everything that rewards powerful gear. That includes:
---
\- weekly challenges
---
\- daily challenges
---
\- spider bounty
---
\- heroic adventures
---
\- flashpoint
---
\- 100k nightfall 
---
\- valor rank reset
---
\- ascedent challenge
---
\- raid
---
\- some exotic quests drop above power
---
Only thing you can really do is ask in the mobile app nothing else really works
---
Welcome to the fold, sister.
---
You know who does care and appreciate you? Shaxx. There is not a more supporting character in any video game, I may have sided with the Vanguard but when the time comes, I stand wwith Shaxx.
---
be glad. Aim assist really blows sometimes (since it will heat-seek a nearer enemy than the one you're actually aiming at)
---
Thanks for all the encouragement and advice!!
---
Get some heavy ammo and use the Thunderlord üëçüèª
---
That's dope, Cousin.
---
Took a month to get that damned thing done.  I feel yer pain.
---
that doesn't sound "assist" lol rip.
---
Devrim and who are married?
---
You sure you didn‚Äôt feel 115% bad?
---
Youre stupid kid
---
Im waiting until i can have stable internet to chase pinnacle weapons. in the meantime, i will play crucible to make shaxx proud
---
That's definitely not true on PS4, It only took me around 17 comp matches for 93% and around 5 or 6 quickplays for the last 7% since I thought it would go faster.
---
Ok but not to be harsh but it sounds like you just weren't doing very well. I was getting around 10% every quickplay game and 10-15% in rumble.
---
i think it sounds like a lot of fun. a nice little place for your clan to hang out.  Im big on customization in my games and would love to have a base for Unsurrpassable
---
I agree I just wished they would have nerfed blade barrage with it,  or buff all supers! MWUHAHA
---
Can you do that so i can get mine? :P
---
Maybe its just my opinion but Prime seems more directive towards the objective than normal Gambit. They both have vaguely described mechanics, but its hard to say which should be locked behind the other. If anything, I think they should \*both\* be locked until a player completes some version of a tutorial run for Gambit.. 
---
It just sucks when experienced players have to deal with new players who are still trying to discover/learn the mechanics of the game. And I don't want to have to mentor every new player in every random fireteam I get dropped into when running solo. 
---
He killed his ghost.
---
I hope not, I‚Äôm almost done with thorn but haven‚Äôt started the allegiance quest yet.
---
Your decision to make memes nobody can read, but are still mildly funny?
---
Exactly, I was gonna suggest a 40 year old truck driver with a scruffy beard wearing a vest. 
---
is this a fan sketch or official?
---
This man over here getting 7th Column in freaking GAMBIT and I can't even hold a 5 kill streak
---
I did just that. I looked at the sub and every time Mayhem comes up people say 'oh just do mayhem for standard kills for PvP steps you dont wanna do, it's easy!'
---
After 5 games my TLW quest was at 5%. Never went higher than 15%.
---
I would literally spawn, move forward for about 2 seconds and watch an enemy round the corner and I'd instantly get BB'd, Hammer of Sol'd, Thundercrashed, or Spectral'd every life.
---
I'd try to play safe (as people recommended) until Nova Bomb was ready and chuck it at a person/group getting maybe a kill, then die again to a counter super and go back into the cycle of spawn deaths. I feel like if I'm not playing a Hunter then why bother queuing, since 80% of my deaths in Mayhem were to Hunters. I saw two other Warlocks, both on the enemy team.
---
The worst part is I've spawn killed people too. I've watched 3 people spawn right in front of me and I mowed them down before they could really react.
---
Honestly crucible as a whole just feels awful for me. I'm pretty decent at other PvP shooters but crucible is just a horrible experience to me.
---
I would love if the masterwork took away the ghost bullets. Then it would be good... 
---
I got TLW by playing a lot of Iron Banner, but the grind for the void HC kills on Thorn is just idiotically slow. It also doesn't help that every time I go into competitive for the score bump my team are either A: utterly incompetent, B: leave the match randomly, or C: both.
---
Is it really that hard to read? Like serious question. I‚Äôm on mobile, looks fine to me. 
---
It's 1% I swear I got only 1% for 8 ikelos HC kills several times.
---
I haven't got it either, but my friend did the raid once and got it. Jammy bastard!
---
That makes sense. Do you have midnight coup from the leviathan? It and D.F.A are pretty similar and midnight coup is my favorite in the game personally.
---
I'm not bad at handcannons but I spent hours in competitive, getting at least a few kills per match, yet only have 14% by now. It's pain.
---
Yeah my kd ratio is sitting at .80 or something. I hate pvp
---
You're kidding right? I can get like 12 kills with the ikelos HC, and get one bloody percent.
---
Congrats 
---
an r/KarmaRoulette, ouch.
---
What‚Äôs the name of the shader that you are using?
---
Can you do the Sunshot? These are great.
---
Well, apart from most likely sitting in tower emoting alone, she‚Äôs free...and single. 
---
Yeah, against Golden Gun and Machine Guns some form of overpenetration rips it apart. It's a piss-poor super and even direct lunge-slams wont even be detected. 
---
Lol Narcs
---
Yeah! It was a cutscene, I think it was the cutscene before landing on Mars I don‚Äôt remember, it was taken some time ago when I was finishing the story for her. 
---
Well she's quite pretty!
---
Shhhh! If you keep saying how great it is then everyone will want to be a Hunter!
---
This makes me laugh. It's day... 3? After the quest was released. Why does everyone expect it to take no time and be absurdly simple?
---
Take your time, if you suck at pvp (not trying to be rude or say you do but some people do) it's still obtainable just stop expecting every exotic quest to be done immediately just because sweaties and try hards have it.
---
Also stay out of comp, half of the game modes don't promote farming, you'll ruin it for people trying if youre aiming to use extremely sub par weapons to farm kills and it's easier to use the very non-meta handcannons in quickplay for the same or faster progress. Ive seen an absurd amount of ikelos HC running around and they get zero kills on most elimination/countdown because theyre such easy targets.
---
TL/DR You and everyone can do it, just stop putting streamer timelines on yourself and making it harder by cutting corners in comp.
---
well if you have spatial awareness its completely fine, and not nearly as bad as telesto was
---
Yeah I got them all but I'd rather have legendary gear
---
Y3 is Saturn related (based on D2 cutscene) and Penumbra is Calus-themed, but they could tie in SIVA sometime.
---
Drifter*
---
I know about that but i got an entry in a lore book called for every rose a thorn and I‚Äôm. Not sure how I got it
---
All i see is cheap kills, it's pretty easy when you can just blade barrage and rocket launch yourself to victory 
---
I‚Äôm sure my hunter would end up ‚Äòborrowing‚Äô some knives and shoving them into his makeshift knife holsters on his gauntlets....or...maybe hide them in his boot. Who knows, he has heavy edgy bastard energy
---
Thank you very much! &lt;3
---
Approximately how many motes you need to complete the collector weekly bounty. I feel like I made the wrong choice, but nothing is stopping me from dropping giant blockers.
---
Every time I play with match making
---
r/punpolice also F
---
Because it's a pre order bonus, which is free, you didnt pay extra so you didnt get screwed over on anything. It's still there if you put effort to get it too.
---
OP is such a bro. He ate all the blue pills and let all the loot for us
---
The ones Thorn drops ;)
---
Yeah I can imagine, I blazed past Warmind and Curse of Osiris and just now finished the part with Uldren Sov
---
My thoughts exactly. The funny part was he was all the way at the black armory next to ada when I started. 
---
Definitely can be hit or miss. You can do it!
---
Why should ANYONE let him go? Nobody should
---
...w...what?...
---
I didn't even know that you had to trigger stuff to get weapons to drop, I just got some armor pieces, and finally got my reaper class armor in last nights reckoning.  Also that solar singe with knights in T2 is straight up bs we all died in less than 1 second.  I am at 669 light.
---
do... do you mean Titans?...

"When people complain about the Thorn quest"

That honestly doesnt look to bad.

Quality meme

If you wouldn't mind, I'd love a link to all the info, I love lore
---
I think it might also be about the Last Word. He was pretty pissed when your guardian shows it to him, or it's bugged
---
Get your IK hand cannon! 
---
Got so many people out there farming for that 1st one.
---
little did he knew, that's just a pve player that wants the pain to end so he could get the powerful gear, aka me
---
Me and 2 friends were grinding for 12 hours last night. Got both guns. It was hell.
---
I'd love to see all the supers in first person.
---
I'll find one for you, guess you sided vanguard 
---
Actually I haven't sided at all yet, I have that reckoning mission to do first lolüòÖ
---
This ... is actually amazing.
---
Actual his idea was like gambit. We all know cayde mayve been crazy at times but he was never stupid.
---
Current gambit is stupid on the levels of playing with fire. And the fire is napalm. Sooner or later everything gonna backfire.
---
Lmao right? Rn I‚Äôm multitasking, doing thorn quest and trying to get to fabled
---
Imagine blade barrage, you spin my head right round right round.
---
Try Jotunn for the end strike. Aim assist is so good that it will curve your shot off of the ogres and into the closed shrieker. Similar to how Truth rockets would make hard turns around a rock. 
---
I feel the quest for it is SO lazy! The last quest was just a new boss! Nothing to do with the drifter or any new content just, things that was in the game already like EP, nightfall and competitive, I was hoping for a good missions behind it but nothing, something like the last word final quest would of been cool 
---
Aww see the quests were not the problem for me. I have both sitting finished but only got to 1700 before end of season at my farthest. Guess I need to start earlier. 
---
It honestly looks so good on hunters. 
---
Haha - me too. :D
---
She looks just like my hunter

Being on both ends of dirty team wipes I agree, but I am glad you are willing to let people have fun even if it means they need an 'easy button' to do so.

Me too. Have they said when it‚Äôs coming back?

Facial hair, I'm tired of this clean shaven world, I want to be a grizzly old veteran

Brother brother BROTHER, I started crucible with a fat 0 GLORY. I had 0% on Thorn, 0% on LW too, but you know what? It sucked. It really did. The first 30% hurt me and I was losing EVERY SINGLE GAME WITHOUT FAIL. But then, at 31% something changed. I was landing my shots and getting nearly 8% per game, and I WAS WINNING! I kept going and winning and pushing past my limits, and eventually I even (accidentally) beat the Crucible kills for LW. At the end of the night, I went from 0 glory to 972 Glory (and I lost my final match of the night due to a thrower). Every single game (except for the game with the thrower) I was in the positive KD's.
---
You can do it, I believe in you!

Hammerhead - best way to remember think of how hard that fucker hits

... EH? What the fuck does that even mean? I was playing comp with Ikelos HC landing nearly all final blows and it usually gave me like .5 percent per kill.
---
You the man
---
I like Ikelos HC tho
---
Yim yum
---
Yeah I only noticed the other day, seems kinda dumb to put it somewhere people will just be walking all over it.
---
It's my go to on my Titan but on my hunter he rocks the gift of the nine
---
I regretted my decision of joining the vanguard as soon as I heard the Drifter tapes
---
I enjoy Gambit Chrome as well as Metro Shift
---
Just tap the trigger for a couple of shots and wait until you see them running at you to hold it, turns it into a sniper almost.
---
I was 2 light underleveled and the Thrall kept 1 shotting me. LIKE WTF THRALL IM HEADSHOTTING YOU W MEMENTO MORI WHY YOU NOT DEAD YET?
---
*Two heavy shotguns. Across and Tractor. 
---
Thanks 
---
No, but after the 50th wipe you sorta feel like it.
---
Great video. Thanks for the tips!
---
Haha salt
---
This is the quality I came here for. Take my upvote.
---
Dude keep working on it trust me that thing is a beast when fully Master worked. I have it equipped with target acquisition and unflinching scout and it's just a monster. I gotta team wipes just using that. 
---
Wow..body shot izanagi...much skill
---
I'm a dirty Luna's sweat. Forgive me. 
---
Yuss
---
I get basically nothing but survival, with rare occurrence of clash.
---
It doesn't seem very random to me
---
Ditto
---
I understand now after watching the trailer
---
I have one with Outlaw/Rampage and it hasn‚Äôt left my kinetic slot, on my Hunter, since.
---
PC still has aim assist but it works a little different. Console will have a greater "stickiness" to the reticle while on PC aim assist basically comes down to only hit box size. That's why queen breaker was still crazy with it's more than double intended aim assist values. You could literally be completely off of their head a decent ways and still get a headshot. (Higher range stats have been shown to increase aim assist values at range resulting in more frequent headshots at range)
---
Aims gun in general direction of Titan
---
Gets kicked to title screen 
---
So is the jerky there but you can't buy it or it's just not there at all?
---
Almost had me until your little blurb at the end.  Prospector does melt, my guess is it is operator error.  If you need someone to show you how to fire your weapons let me know or ask someone else on here to help.
---
Play the game
---
Yes!
---
LOL
---
I would've thought the different name would've gave it away. Rather than it just saying "Thief of Thieves (Heroic)", giving it a different name and description would indicate it's part of the quest. 
---
Oh, I'll just check it out tomorrow after I reinstall D2. Have to do a fresh install of windows to a new drive, but I got Thorn last night.
---
Old drifter still needs mot-
---
Why his body kinda look like a blue Aksis 
---
Its like an icecream sammich
---
Congrats! About to be on that step to
---
What armor are you wearing?
---
It looks really good
---
I have Kill Clip Rampage drop Mag with a range MW and if I can get a single kill and escape with some health its go time baby.
---
Maybe you can abandon the quest and pick it back up again? Maybe that can resolve it or go to bungie support directly. 
---
I genuinely forgot how ridiculous this show was
---
So fast I only see you take 2 down.   Where is the 3rd shot. Lemme rewatch again. 
---
She sided with the Drifter didn‚Äôt she üòÇ 
---
Nice! You can do it üòä 
---
It's so easy on Xbox. Just hit guide and tap Y real quick for a screenshot. You can also record clip of the previous seconds/minutes (you can set the amount of time) of gameplay. Pretty sure there's even an option to autoupload to your onedrive or whatever, and if you wanna go crazy you can cut/edit it to your hearts desire.
---
I‚Äôve done it myself 
---
Nope, Never get plays like this sooo
---
The new background image of this sub should just be a picture of a screen where somebody has a piece of armor at 666. 
---
First dies, then second/third in one bullet
---
Feels so good
---
Titan with 5 mobility be like.... that girl standing still 
---
The crucible was ass, had a WAY easier time getting last word tbh. I‚Äôd rather have to have at least a barely positive kid for a few games than have to use specific stuff and get like 200 kills
---
I actually like Ikelos HC it feels good and looks cool 
---
I'm sure he got his pun O-Cayde before he posted it.
---
You have to have the catalyst for the wardcliffe though or it‚Äôs not gonna work at all.
---
Yea
---
*During the Thorn Strike*
---
lol
---
I agree it was a literal spawn camp. 
---
Alllrighty i was wrong..i looked it up and couldnt find it so i dug through mountains of porn in my history to find the original post, its a lore book called revelations. I dont know where exactly it is, but it is in game
---
All people from the tower and snitches apart from the beating hunter in the tower 
---
 Looks cool af
---
*screams in nova warp*
---
Eris Mornament
---
Geez, where can I find Hunter chest armor like that in game? üòÖ üçàüçà
---
That wasn't the part the sarcasm would apply to. xD
---
He actually won Movie of the week too! Go congratulate that man on Twitter  
---

---
Can someone explain why is this siding thing happening im very confused 
---
I only have one character high enough for it :/ 
---
My point is that everyone is running the same setup and will for a couple weeks till everyone has thorn. 
---
I used a kindled orchid with a good roll  on it 
---
I remember having this problem in D1 but my ghost lets me summon sparrows instantly and I play on PC so it's actually faster to just tab-e and sail away
---
...didnt you leave two matches in a row?
---
I just find that I aim better in first person so I feel I would be more accurate that way with the ranged supers
---
Actually no. It was released nov 15, 2001. At least in america, you need to be 21, or 18 if you're active military.
---
The original Halo is 17 yea- JESUS CHRIST, has it really be that long since Halo 1?
---
You spelled bomb wrong. 
---
No as long as you collect the loot if you fail. 
---
r/UnexpectedThanos
---
But pc does have a little bit of aim assist. Otherwise I would miss way more often. 
---
When was trials removed cus i still got some
---
https://i.imgur.com/3WDcYbV.png
---
Yep.  I noticed that last night myself. 
---
Before forsaken green ammo wasn't special ammo, but energy ammo, which dropped as frequently as primary does now, and every energy weapon used it, since snipers, fusions, and shotguns were power(heavy) weapons then, so ammo economy was only an issue for power ammo
---
    Playstayles that annoy me shouldn't even be possible.
---
Same. They are all surprisingly void. I assume for Thorn quest. I died a lot to them last night and I don‚Äôt likey.
---
Too true.  I have been playing destiny for months but never touched raid/ comp crucicle. How am I supposed to KWTD if i have never tried, i watched that gauntlet run video still i don't understand it properly. 
---
This should be an option.
---
I would have such better control of my character if it looked like this.
---
I'm so used to First person that even flying with Lion Rampant and sword I can sometimes fuck up my jumping.
---
Welcome to Moe's!
---
What about Foregone Conclusion? Or maybe Hazard of the Cast? Im an Auto Rifle kind of guy. Mostly because my aim is not so great therefore spreading bullets works.
---
*distorted recorder cover of Avengers theme plays*
---
A lot of people think that you can guides and know what to do but I'm still left just as confused. What do you play if I may ask?
---
It‚Äôs always been this way for me lol, back in D1 used to always load into cosmodrome right after getting a new exotic to test it out. 
---
Been doing the same thing in trostland aswell
---
I got that ghost in my second run during Kalli encounter ha! (i farmed 3 weeks for gambit ship tho)
---
I played halo 5 like 2 days ago so idk what he‚Äôs talking about 
---
Ma man, I appreciate the gesture even though its not achievable. Made me feel good. Bless you brother.
---
Titan: you see either your lightning fists,a hammer,giant hammer,or a shield
---
Warlock: dawnblade,lightning hands or a mini black hole looking bomb
---
Hunter: a cool staff,two daggers
---
I mean if you only play pvp ur gonna end up with Luna's eventually
---
Fucked 'em UP, boi!
---
I still dont have that ship. I can get exotics weapons easy but not ships and ghosts
---
I feel ya heh
---
Nope, gotta wait for xur
---
No u 
---
Go to the drifter maybe
---
Might not be an awful idea
---
I feel you, man. I just suck so much butt at PvP. I did have a good 7 matches in th comp playlist this morning. But I don't expect that to go well again lol
---
*sleep dart tea baggings intensifies* 
---
Sounds cool tho can‚Äôt wait to use it in year 3
---
I love her so much. 
---
The colonel is also there
---
How does one trade in 20 exotic engrams lmao
---
To be honest I don't think it's going to tilt people much. It's really good but even with soul devourer it's still three headshots for a kill so I think Ace is still the king based on it's range and memento mori.
---
Siding with the vanguard for that extra core every week! Suck it!
---
I was playing For Honor a month ago and I can't count the amount if times I was able to ping and have a teammate res me or I was made aware of a teammate I hadn't realized was dead because they could ping me. It saved many a game from the brink. I was logging onto reddit to make a post about revives in gambit but I was very happy to see someone already did it.
---
That was some solid self control you showed. I would have panicked and missed when 3 enemies pop up on screen at once. Also, Bite of the Fox is so good. 
---
Oh, agreed!  But there are tryhards out there who don't know that. XD
---
lol I recognize that inventory loading screen length, I cry everytime
---
I‚Äôm impressed how well you play the recorder with your helmet on
---
I mean yeah but this is edited for memes right?
---
We need another lazer tag weekend
---
(Tries to shoulder charge hunter who is scared to shoot him and falls of map) " hunter dodge and jump is op" 
---
Good lord.  I want it.  I botched doing the quest for it and missed out.  I was sad when i realized it was gone
---
Check Amazon cause they're always selling it cheap 
---
And also sharex.
---
Forgot about tractor cannon, you‚Äôre right
---
That doesn't mean he murdered them
---
I can.see.this being true if one of the perks on the OEM was singer's server maintenance
---
It‚Äôs such a pain in the ass sometimes especially when I‚Äôm playing crucible and I change my special but it takes to long to where I already spawned in and lost my special ammo 
---
No, he did not directly kill them, but be brought guaranteed death to them all for no reason
---
Sounds interesting. I don't mind Countdown in it's current form for comp. Although it would be cool to throw in neutral bomb in the quickplay playlist as a "warm up" for comp
---
Go to the spider he has it
---
I know how you feel with the timegate. Unless bungie changes how truth to power works, I'll get chronicler 2 weeks too late to get the IRL badge.
---
Lol
---
No joke...  love my malfeasance. 
---
0 mobility titan is still faster
---
I hip fired in air, hit a **single** shot and got marked. 
---
**excuse me**
---
It could be his lines to another player that you're just listening in on. I know I get that a lot after our team kills an enemy invader, we get their voice line telling me "your teammates back, blah blah blah"
