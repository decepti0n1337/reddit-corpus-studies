Here's [an overview](https://www.shacknews.com/article/114391/all-powerful-gear-tiers-and-sources-in-destiny-2) of reward tiers, maybe it'll help you.

---
---
Pfft I have the app open now! I create multiple lfg fire teams and clog up the system within 3 minutes we‚Äôre back on with 3 new 950 guardians who seem chill in party and all know their shit. Manage to clear the encounter we were stuck on for hours üòé
---
It really is.  It's like foetracer and wormhusk for hunters put together and its effects multiplied by 3.   Wormhusk was op for hunters in warmind for maybe a season?  Wild OEM is going on it's 4th.
---
I'd recommend Beloved Sniper (From Menagerie), Outbreak Perfected, Thorn and Last Word. The last 2 aren't the best but they are really fun to use.
---
I actually just got that in 4 hours yesterday. Just a lot of matches but eventually if you lose, you lose like 10-20 glory points
---
Yeah I like it too haha, it's a solid double meaning
---
‚ÄúGood work, Guardian. Your light is strong‚Äù -Shaxx
---
Yep.
---
same problem. i cant get the gun :)))
---

---
ty bungie
---
izanagis too :)))))))))))
---
Good job man, it‚Äôs definitely a hell of a grind
---
Did you just say thorn ?!
---
Same hour delivery.
---
How? I‚Äôve gotten nothing but weapons from IB
---
Because he isn‚Äôt right the Legion isn‚Äôt at all comparable to Amazon in terms of shittiness
---
Hate it so much. Takes 2 seconds to bank before invading
---
Nice
---
I am trying to return as well. I know I was not quite done with Osiris last time i played. I want to pick up where I left off. Unfortunately it seems I can't. I have no idea what kind of thought went into just putting the player on the newest expansion if they purchased it right away instead of literally where they left off.  
---
I only even found this thread literally in the process of googling how the hell I'm supposed to finish my Osiris campaign and move into warmind, then forsaken, then finally get to shadowkeep. I see now based on OP that I guess I have to go find amanda holliday. That makes literally no sense. She's the shipwright.  
---
It also appears I am not allowed to finish osiris. The campaign is just straight gone. If I want to finish I have to pick it up as a legacy quest and start over from the beginning. That's stupid as shit.  
---
Also, she only even offers me the red war, curse of osiris, and warmind. My destination map has a big ass shadowkeep icon on it, but nothing for Forsaken. I clicked into every single location mousing over all the quest icons until I found one that finally says Forsaken, but I don't even know if it's the right quest. I guess it must be as it's the only one I found. It's just infuriating.

Same thing happened to me. Got map bopped to infinite space.
---
‚ÄúYour light will be tested guardian, and you will be stronger for it‚Äù
---
 -Lord Saladin
---
Lol you don't have to dedicate your life to the game to get a seal I'm grinding for a title and I usually play like an hour every day max and it doesn't make you a burn out it's called a hobby
---
&gt; "Ha! Typical Titan idiocy."
---
Also are the year one weapon good even if they aren‚Äôt meta ? Like the origin story ,the nameless ,dare devil cuz i really like them
---
can i delete a character and redo that over and over?
---
Do it... Pussy üòÇ
---
No it doesn‚Äôt work like that. You can only have three characters to do it
---
When you get shot:
---
Titans continue running and turn the corner
---
Hunters enact a complicated pattern of jumping and dodging-and fall off the map
---
Warlocks straight up die
---
Your /s really ruins the point of it
---
Man it‚Äôd be so nutty if the masks classified as ornaments
---
so i haven‚Äôt played destiny 2 since before the first DLC launched so i‚Äôm pretty overwhelmed with all the new stuff added to the game. what‚Äôs the best way to get legendaries and exotics? and what are generally the best weapon types for pve (i‚Äôve heard that scout rifles aren‚Äôt the best anymore)?
---
Oh didn't know that. TY
---
Are they locked behind a quest or raid?
---
If you're talking about on Duke then you're my kind of guy
---
Used the new mask for most of the season so far.  Have started using wormhusk, since I'm experimenting with builds based around arc battery.  Most people seem to like bottom tree with it, but I've been running reload dodge top tree so that any melee kill recharges my dodge while keeping the reload.  Probably gonna see how I can make it work with liars handshake next and some swashbuckler guns, then dragons shadow and sixth coyote maybe.
---
no. also does xur not give u exotics for other classes?
---
it's worth it boys
---
Not even kidding, I got an exotic engram drop from killing a vandal while patrolling EDZ
---
"I've been falling... FOR THIRTY MINUTES!"
---
Monte Carlo dropped in Vex Offensive and got my Rat King Catalyst completed.
---
I can't believe people are still filming as if we have vertical TV'S. Sorry, just one of my pet peeves that totally annoys me.
---
Yeah the problem with it is you can't play as aggressively with it as most other ults because of the lack of resistance. It needs more duration. It'd also be nice if it could, y'know, one shot other ults which one shot you.
---
You have to be playing the class to get the gear for said class.
---
I think it's bugged, soz

---
Care to elaborate because I don't find caydes death to be the main reason forsaken was good
---
An friend of mine and I tried the strike earlier today. It's ridiculous.
---
Probably a well of radiance, but also everyone should change up depending on the situation.
---
I see they chose the superior race choice as well.
---
Beam it down Scotty
---
Some of us will never earn it because we don't like pvp.
---
When you pull your hammers you *can't* be one hit by GG though...
---
Cool üëå
---
Ty man !
---
You take that back! I maimed it before and I will main it after
---
Why? It's easily the worst exotic in D1 and noone would use it in D2 even if it was good. It has no place.
---
The survival playlist is the one you want. I would reccomend freelance survival if you do not have a team
---
I dont even run oem in pvp. Peacekeepers all day.
---
Survival freelance, or servival team. Bottom right of crucible director

# FAQ
---
## What does this mean?
---
The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.
---
## Why did you do this?
---
There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:
---
* Rudeness towards other Redditors,
---
* Spreading incorrect information,
---
* Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a `/s`.
---
## Am I banned from the Reddit?
---
No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.
---
## I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?
---
Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.
---
## How can I prevent this from happening in the future?
---
Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.
---
I play solo other than matchmaking and up to 6mans you can do everything solo and its pretty enjoyable.
---
They're fixing spectral, not buffing it. This was never intended.
---
One Earth can 3 tap if you hit crits most of the time, and it‚Äôs a 150 RPM.
---
Stomp EE5 always
---
Sealed ahamkara grasps because if u use the blade barrage trees melee ability it auto reloads ur gun like pre nerf lunafactions
---
I've lived by warlock since day one in Destiny 1 but then I made a titan now I can't stop playing titan
---
Quest from shaxx
---
Maybe a nice rapid fire build
---
I‚Äôll Sacrifice a few upvotes for the person who reply‚Äôs. Balanced, as all things should be .
---
Lol I was the kid talking in class getting sent to the office.
---
My dream titan build includes the masterwork sweet business and the catalyst just wont drop.
---
If it kills the target
---
There are some nice blues like that botheration. (And also, in my current experimental build, I found that there's only one kinetic scout rifle with quickdraw in the game; spoiler, it's a blue one.)
---
Unsure of that I am
---
You got to do 100 damage first, switch and shoot. Or just lob it into zones and pray. Your gonna have more luck using a heavy GL and just hog the heavy. It took me like a year and a half to get this thing so dont expect it to go fast.
---
Fighting lion for weaking ppl off
---
I used them.  Sorry, I should‚Äôve asked first.
---
The Cabal delivery service. "Our speedy service kills the competition."
---
Fine print: And you.
---
Nope. Never
---
Survival, actually. I can do some actual testing and report back, but I've definitely got 1-taps with both GLs
---
Warm mind
---
? How am I salty pointing out that forsaken‚Äôs plot was weak
---
Not even Oryx himself could beet them
---
In the story? No
---
Love how theres someone on the far right with the name 'Suck My Cabals'. This image is just cursed lol
---
10 minutes, i picked him up and put him on the ground multiple times but he‚Äôd just jump back up
---
Same issue
---
There‚Äôs something about sub 1000 glory that I don‚Äôt quite understand, despite my skill level being high the fact I found 4 different 5000+ in my sub 1000 games was crazy to me, once you break that the matchmaker is...better, but by Mythic I found the matchmaker would randomly shove morons on my team after winning and useful teammates after losing
---
The problem comes from checking a player‚Äôs stats after a match and seeing something along the lines of 23 kills - two of them with recluse, one with mountaintop, two with melee and 17 from a super.
---
Hold up... titans read?
---
Well I‚Äôm a uni student who always has the laptop on hand. In my case all the specs are ticked for recommended specs except for the GPUs which I have is a 940mx 2gb. But destiny 2 still runs at 60fps. So I haven‚Äôt experienced any lag which majorly affects the gameplay you know.
---
Whisper has a timer and kicks you out tho I can do multiple  on Mars with next to no interruptions
---
You should, its great
---
Ye that‚Äôs what I thought I just wasn‚Äôt 100% sure and had to say all the options
---
Mine is Roomba 890 Wi-Fi Vacuum idfk why
---
So I should just try it and see what happens?
---
Solar warlocks die after they start flying
---
Thank you, I'm a dumbass
---
People use discord to chat on PC for most games. Just look up clans for PC and you'll probably find one you like and then just figure out how to join or apply
---
That nightmare is an awesome one for fragments. 
---
I poked it the other day and was pleasantly surprised to know that he dropped 9 Phantasmal Fragments after taking 5 Honed Edge shots to the face and a few bloop tube shots.
---
Ok. I've never seen Fighting lion one shot and have always heard it couldn't so I assumed you were wrong. I'll probably end up doing some testing myself.
---
Thank you for filing your complaint. However, it will not be treated as serious or credible unless adequate proof is provided. Thank you for your patronage at That Makes No Fucking Sense, and have a nice day.
---
Yes the rank will maintain throughout the season even if you drop
---
They all do
---
Cowabunga it issss
---
r/uselessnobody
---
The quest is currently bugged, pretty sure bungie addressed it and is working on a fix
---
This boy's been smoking some grass.
---
**Optimal Dps**
---
Backwards nice
---
Dude... I‚Äôve been randomly scrolling on my feed for half an hour. This was the first thing to make me burst out laughing lol. Thank you for this!
---
The forges are on a daily playlist on the EDZ map and the for the Bergusia forge key you need to do a quest that is currently bugged.
---
and now its at 99% FML
---
Not all heros wear capes.
---
Just completed another comp match, 4-0 this team and crimson dropped for me.
---
Honestly, I would be fine with some sort of rotating ban list maybe on a weekly basis or something. Like this week joltun and recluse can't be used. then maybe next time no grenade launchers, then maybe no ARs... you know something to keep it fresh and force players to try something different. keep things interesting
---
I think there was a thing once about a veteran package or something with a shader and an emblem.
---
Try some mobility mods or guns that give you that. 
---
My loadouts are top tree bubble, autistic panic missile, and banhammer daddy with doomfangs or sythoceps with the MIDA and Trust. I rarely use my power weapon so not real thoughts there...
---
Other 'tips' -Zig-zag motions and sliding to get in close. As well as baiting them to get closer to me around buses, barrels, corners ect...I'll actually run in a circle to keep my sprint during this lol. Lastly, it tends to take two punches, so try to aim your second punch where they could land/move.
---
practice, you'll be able to predict people's behavior and work around it. It'll be absolutely painful during this learning curve though not gonna lie.
---
yes Id love this idea man. Force people to change it up and try something new and hey, maybe theyd find a new fav loadout
---
I've reached this rank and have already reset twice. I have all the wins and logged in and out and switched characters. The stuff of myths won't complete :( I want to cheese it with the recluse like everyone else
---
Yeah, I always have a wave and the thank emote on all my chars. Can't really communicate well with the Floss.
---
I believe in you, your time will come and your rise will be glorious.
---
Does he have the Forsaken annual pass?
---
Probably like $350
---
Yes, I'm having this same issue and I'm not having much success finding an answer or solution online. Oh well.
---
You'll have to complete the quest on PS4, but once you've got it you can use it on PC.
---
Still you can't say that 1 shot melee isn't op.
---
Because it is.
---
I love this
---
Dude, for real, you have to see that bottom striker / OEM is broken?   
---
I mean come on, you are joking right, yeah you are, almost had me there for a second.
---
Ah tru
---
This will probably be a dumb response, but are you playing competitive? It only works if you play the comp playlist.
---
Top tree void titan with the exotic chest piece Armamentarium. Give you two grenades. I also prioritize any armor with high discipline to help with the cool down. I've currently got 85 so my grenade recharges ever 41 seconds.
---
Same day at 11:55
---
Or 23:55 whatever floats your boat
---
It can't come soon enough.
---
Absolutely not. D1 with everything is like $10. Base D2 is free so you only have to buy forsaken and Shadowkeep if you ant everything which would run you like $80.
---
Iron Banner counts toward Valor rank.  I believe the RTK quest is for Glory rank.
---
It's really not, it might be strong (not OP) in 6v6 because it is easy to be focused on someone else and get meleed in the side or back, but in a competitive setting it's super easy to avoid a shoulder charge.
---
I hear ya üòÇ
---
Too much Tegridy
---
Ba dum tiss!
---
I mean it kinda already is
---
I know right, some people have a lot of hate for Fortnite so I decided to make a throwaway with the perfect name to make them a little more angry.
---
Don't get me wrong, there's literally no game that I've ever loved as much as Destiny but hot damn does it get me frustrated when banana rolls around lol
---
Yeah it's free and the strongest weapon in the game it's stupid it hasn't been touched
---
I haven‚Äôt had issues with these two. It‚Äôs literally just the lunas howl and broken scouts that I‚Äôm having trouble w. Could be bc of my play style idk
---
Get to 2100 in comp
---
I would start grinding the bounties to get a rare one if you don‚Äôt have one already.
---
This makes me very uncomfortable in more ways than one.
---
Some of them require opening crates on nessus, in artifacts edge or the hallows I believe.
---
It most definitely is. But that particular Nightfall matchmaking... I feel like the population will run rampant with it. (Kinda looking forward to that though, as j don't have one yet -_-)
---
Medals are just any medal.
---
"... salvation."
---
hi everyone! here is a piece of fanart I did inspired by "that" moment. I would love to hear what you think of that last cutscene, it blew my mind! I just had to sketch a little something up inspired by it.
---
thank you so much for looking! if you like my work and would like to talk destiny, you can find me on twitter @MoonMaws! I am also posting this as a spoiler, just to be safe!
---
much love!
---
\- Atlas
---
Am I the only one facing people with lower power but can kill you faster than normal?
---
Yeah I was just curious if masterworking the armor would make my character harder to kill. Back before this season I knew it made it harder to kill you in super but if that's the case I'm not worried about masterworking armor
---
Don‚Äôt you need the me quest from ada
---
Got it from the pursuit quest as the final reward it all rolled with really good stats so I‚Äôm keeping it going to masterwork it.
---
Oh yes Iur Yeet, I forgot about her. I also wanted to do this so little towards the end that you can see how little effort I put into the WotM bosses and Oryx lmao.
---
You know just as well as I do my dude
---
I mean all it's going to do is give the people(such as myself) that don't have a good legendary shotgun to get one. I don't really like using shotguns for PvP, but I'd still like the option if I want to change up my playstyle or of I have a bounty/quest of some sort for PvE or PvP
---
I think you're just mad
---
You don‚Äôt receive a bonus on weekly reset
---
Exaaaaactly. Maybe it wouldn't be such a bad thing after all. ü§î
---
Uh ok? I don‚Äôt understand what that has to do with the cashes but I‚Äôve done the quest and I literally have a gun weapon frame bounty that I‚Äôve collect the compound ether and can‚Äôt get the prompt to open the cashes even when I‚Äôve killed the stupid guards
---
There is a base quest you need to complete, there may still be more.
---
That‚Äôs always been the seal chief. Doubt a 4th class will come in the near future
---
There was an old joke about that back in D1 before Taken King came out. Obviously it never happened, but you never know. Could happen. As far as I know, nothing in the lore talks of a fourth class. Though with the darkness coming back and all, we may get one
---
I mean it will increase your resilience.
---
You most likely will want to masterwork some armor pieces to get the perk combinations you want.
---
It's been like that since day one of the beta.
---
But hey, anything can happen.
---
It just says medals.
---
I think he needs to at least do the titan world quest.
---
Gambit prime has some really good weapons.
---
Anarchists. Boom.
---
You get temp banned for deserting that scales up the more you do it within a set number of hrs. Had that happen to me for 5 minutes (my 1st offense) because life stuff and internet got me inactivity booted twice within an hr.
---
[deleted]
---
Yup
---
No sadly not I jus started this clan a little before Shadowkeep dropped
---
there‚Äôs only one thing you need... mindbenders, it‚Äôll solve all your problems
---
There is a temporary ban, I have no idea how many games you have to run away from. 
---
I‚Äôve only left once and I had won the match and returned to orbit without letting the match complete thing appear, lost extra points.
---
Dont forget recluse
---
Like butter on a hot skillet.
---
Just get alot if wins and reach Fable in the survival catagory of Crucible, it's not too bad but admittedly takes a little grinding
---
&gt;If they aren't black is it racist?
---
Its time for you to stop posting
---
Yes. One of my favorite loadouts, especially pairing it with the new artifact mod that gives you an overhauled while using the class ability(dodge in this case).
---
nah, it's problems more related to my hardware and game stutters than anything in-game for PvP really.
---
Raid armor is pretty good
---
ok. Someone on discord said that the Invader armor is the only one that matters, true?
---
That depends on your playstyle. If you like invading then yes. There is a set for collecting, one for killing adds and I think the last one Is for defending against invaders and blockers. If you like doing one of those most than I'd say go for that set
---
Thanks will try this :)
---
I think it means civilians or non light wielders. Like guardians of all types and non light wielders all in the one crest / last city  
---
Idk that's just kinda how I see it
---
I think they wanted everyone to at least get good drops even if it's their first time in the Banner, so maybe yeah
---
I figured the raid would be good too but I haven't done that yet. Hoping theres more ways.
---
Yeah but hunters do.... and he‚Äôs both...
---
1 per class is correct. If you beat the campaign on your other characters, they will get their specific exotic as well.
---
Since I play Titan and I am a newb I was just going to stay away from invading and do Sentry.
---
I tried using the wizened rebuke, with auto load and backup plan, and loaded question but the quest step took so long.
---
There was no buff it was a bug fix. The Shattering Strike was always intended to last for 9 seconds but it was broken at only 3. OP was misleading.
---
They will? Ah okay, I was just confused because I just finished it on my Warlock now, and I haven‚Äôt gotten their specific exotic yet. It‚Äôs supposed to be Stormdancers Brace right? The chest piece
---
Don‚Äôt worry about hitting 960 base this season, datto explained in a video that its near impossible to reach 960 base this season assuming more sources are introduced to get pinnacle gear, if you need power i would just do bounties as theres more of an end goal and progress will arguably be faster.
---
He was clearly baited. That Cabal threw a whole box of crayons through the hoop.
---
Its not entirely intended to hit 960 base this season, its more of a status symbol by the looks of it.
---
this post was made by the hunter gang
---
Do you not see the new light prompt?
---
Vanguard Enforcer? You must be the guy that assassinates all the Guardians who sided with the Drifter.
---
Thank you! Really annoying that the watermark isn‚Äôt of the OP
---
Helmet: "Vernal Growth Helm" ornament
---
Arms: "Star-Crossed Fists" ornament
---
Chest: "Armamentarium"
---
Legs: "Sunbreak Greaves" ornament
---
Class: Binary Phoenix Mark (No Ornament)
---
Everything has the "Safety First" shader (Third page of "seasons" in the shader category)

Gotta obey the law, else a face full of lead is coming your way
---
Tokyo Drifter
---
Claim the triumph?
---
Goodluck. You can't kill us all.
---
Is it easier to reach Legend now ?
---
Check out r/fireteams, supper helpful people over there!
---
No problem!
---
All the PoE exotics were mediocre, worst deffit being Dregs promise. But I think of it ever comes back itll be good, just like the other 2 when they came back.
---
With time. I've got about 120,000 down, just 2.88 million to go
---
it does, actually. But somewhat vaguely, saying she's the one to talk to if you wanna experience old storylines
---
B r u h
---
Yeah, and all the constant screaming...
---
One of us will kill you. We can all take our shot together. Aunor will have pause soon enough.
---
I'm waiting for D3 and Xbox Scarlett to arrive... I know you hate me for this but i found out about Destiny two years ago by one youtuber. I just downloaded the demo on my xbox and i loved, but it took year for me to buy whole D1... So i think i missed D2, but i'm waiting for D3. I hope it has good holiday updates!
---
For light stuff, anything works, raid or nightfall, nope to the bow. Grenade launcher in heavy is probably a better choice, better devils, could work whit a fast reload perk. mid tree void is the best for healing i think.
---
&gt; The Flashpoint challenge will appear on your Director map once you reach Power Level 900.
---
Okay, I've really tried, but I cant find it anywhere. I'm level 931 and [Bungie says it's on IO](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/Event/463010297), yet I see no markers or icons or anything. Talking to Asher provides no new content. I this all because I dont have any DLC and am just a New Light player?
---
Grind out anything that gives you prime engrams and just pray to the RNG gods that you get something in that slot... good luck
---
hunters for the 1 2 punch build and spamming throwing knives on bb tree, titan it's all about that skullfort
---
go to tower, go to orbit, go to tower or restart the game.
---
Really? I find that kinda weird for a number of reasons. Firstly, he apparently wasn‚Äôt the only speaker. There were some before him. So those guys were liars too? And didn‚Äôt the speaker say in Destiny 1 that the traveler was dormant and couldn‚Äôt speak? And it‚Äôs unclear, at least to me, whether or not he used his lies to mislead the guardians or spread falsehoods about the traveler or the light.
---
And lastly, at the end of the Red War story, when your guardian is looking up at the traveler, the speaker‚Äôs quote I the last voice we hear. They used his ‚Äúthe light lives in all things.‚Äù It seems like the game is casting him in a very positive, inspirational light... idk, I‚Äôm wanting to either see him as a good or bad person, but maybe he‚Äôs just more complicated than that
---
Use liars handshake. Hit them and before they can react, BOOM, toast
---
No there wasn‚Äôt and there aren‚Äôt now lol. Your probably just a titan main trying to defend your free wall hacks and free over shield
---
Some parts come from mission bosses and some random legendaries on the tangled shore.  Trust me though you will not like the fat arse on the warlock.
---
Okay thank you
---
Thanks anyway
---
This was in store. No delivery. About $74 at the current exchange rate
---
Uhhh I play titan and I did that exact thing this morning.
---
In my defence I‚Äôm new and had never done that strike before
---
Yes, the others were liers.
---
According to the speaker, he was the voice of the traveler so it was implied it spoke to him.
---
The game wants us to see him as s good guy. I see him as a dickhead
---
No I‚Äôm talking about the ‚Äúlucky‚Äù pants
---
Ayyyyy I just got mine tonight as well
---
Being on comms is probably the single best advantage you can have
---
Yeah, I sat there laughing for like 2 mins and just didn't edit it down enough when I decided to make it a gif
---
My type
---
Hell man, I'm running both just in case like, I'd rather be the 1 man wrecking crew that carries the team than the dude that came unprepared with their pants down and light at 760.
---
how long did it take you? i want to do it but it seems expensive and time consuming
---
Since when was self res in D2? Lmao. 
---
Man I wonder what would happen if he somehow got pushed off the cliff seeing that he was able to be ‚Äúkilled‚Äù but not actually die.
---
except the prisoner ones on the tangled shore because fuck those
---
You forgetting the recluse or the mountain top
---
Not gonna lie, top tree Stormcaller with arc bolt grenade and bum rushing an enemy point right at the start of IB is gonna instantly get you 2-6 kills.
---
Afraid it‚Äôs a world drop. Just need to get lucky or xur selling it

Warlock. Actually requires skill to play.
---
Just follow around other people and yell ‚ÄúI CANT BELIEVE WHAT IM SEEING‚Äù every time a kid gets candy.
---
Oh ok thanks
---
I see. Thanks for the reply.
---
Already played with all classes, but I can't decide which I like the most between warlock and hunter. I like the quickness of hunter and the heal of warlock. I like to throw Kamehamehas or purple bombs. Also like to throw a lot of knifes or shoot my purple bow. :/
---
The options or select menu... Everything else loads, but when going to character, it is an endless loading animation
---
When I log out, the select character menu, it's the same loading animation without loading...Can't view my character whatsoever... Didn't have this problem yesterday
---
Hunters have very little regeneration, somewhat decent melees, generally poor grenades, and a lot of mediocre exotics. I‚Äôd say let us have one very situational trick. Died to Warlock and Titan abilities much more often, excluding supers.
---
Stormcaller Chaos Reach with Geomag Stabilisers beats Celestial Nighthawk by 30k damage.
---
I'm right there with you.
---
Goddamn mida flinch.
---
Exactly how easy do you want the game to be?
---
They spawn after every public event. You need to wait like a minute or two and then it opens up in the same part of the map.
---
Pumpkin's haunted
---
I hadn't done the 3 bounty quest, just did that and it triggered a new mission which is to go get that now i think.. cheers
---
We all can admit that Ana bray is sexy
---
May I know what is this app?
---
*gets downvoted for not being fluent in english*
---
You guys are awful
---
Ich hoffe deinen Tag wird sch√∂n sein
---
I always thought it was less repetitive.  Maybe that's because I ignore PVP in Destiny, so I miss out on half of the game.
---
Okay some people are not getting it: I'm not playing destiny because I have 69,420 score.
---
It's a joke I actually have a lot more points now and I am still playin
---
Rise up gamer boys
---
Thank you, and yeah but I really don‚Äôt care because this is the internet so üòÅ
---
Do you have telesto equipped? If so, just unequip it. Bungie disabled it due to a bug.
---
My all time favorite roll
---
I hope bungie combines them into one price here soon
---
I get that you‚Äôre t-bagging this guy because he t-bagged your teammate, but what if the guy you t-bagged only t-bagged your teammate because your teammate t-bagged his teammate :o
---
If you wanna just read an article summarizing the story, this is a concise one.  It's relatively vague overall, but I feel it gets the plot across within a 5-10 minute read.   [https://www.pcgamer.com/destiny-the-story-so-far/](https://www.pcgamer.com/destiny-the-story-so-far/)
---
I appreciate you putting Black Skinhead in it. Wavy Guardian
---
Bold of you to assume that a titan's mind actually works.
---
This is just the iron will set with Black armory shaders
---
Just do 950
---
At least it easy this weeks compared to last week's
---
Btw...
---
Dont kill the boss on the top floor,
---
If you killes him too fast he wont drop anything...
---
Also dont skip any part, just kill them all to reach 100k(i heard that there is extra chance to drop exotics if you get 100k, might be myth)
---
I usually killed it within 15 min with my friends in 950 nightfalls
---
980 is... a horrible place... same drop... dont go there... if you are not well prepared... it took me extra 4min to 10 min to do it... per round... for not better drop aside from masterwork shard
---
I thought this was a cosplay st first too
---
yha just discovered it thanks yha my telesto was disabled
---
What armor is that? It looks awesome
---
Menagerie or the forge weapon, but menagerie is faster.
---
My god no they don't. Invisibility, dodge and jumping abilities alone are a massive advantage.
---
Oh mah lanta üò≠
---
It‚Äôs a meme dude chill out
---
I'm sorry a meme has shaken you to the point of retaliation :'(
---
Oh shit, you right
---
ü§£ it's totally fine no worries
---
Yep
---
how tho
---
When your child makes something disgusting but you have to be nice about it
---
It‚Äôs about the point where I got killed by the enemy I had locked into the finisher animation a full second beforehand via them activating a melee attack, whilst still in the finisher animation, that I decided finishers aren‚Äôt worth it until they get their shit together.
---
Thank you! First cake, it tastes good
---
How exactly is this Destiny related?
---
I don't want to be rude but I see no connection.
---
Yes, I, a 16 year old, dedicated my whole existence to a game. Sure
---
Congrats! Now into the heroic mission üòé
---
Like you can do it in one day. Very casual rn
---
I‚Äôm sorry this meant to go somewhere else
---
I got an exotic engram, and i got the One Eyed Mask, i was like "Oh no..."
---
Aside from oem, Hunter is prob the best class to play in pvp
---
On this note, is the vault shared? Can I buy all 3 on one character and have my other 2 just get them out of the vault?
---
Dope
---
Bud, they can still 3 shot people and they shoot as fast as The Last Word. Those guns are perfectly fine.
---
You have sex with your helmet on after incinerating and reciting the tempest by heart?

When Titans complain about Dawnblade and then Bungie announces OEM will get nerfed
---
I got u bro it seems you have what you need but you have to complete the quest drifter gives you i think it‚Äôs called the intro to gambit just do that and he gives it to you
---
Edit:dm me if you don‚Äôt understand something
---
When you spawn Vorgeth in the Shattered Throne solo
---
Ah great thanks a lot
---
Likewise. Sweet Business + Actium War Rig is great fun.
---
Took a while
---
Omg ty ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚úäüèæ
---
I think they removed the 3 exotic reward from the campaign , namely sunshot , risk runner and graviton lance.
---
There's not really a easy machine gun unless you have access to black armory or the chalice of opulence. The only ones I can think of if you only have the base game and Shadowkeep is a extoic machine gun Thunderlord but it's a random extoic drop unless they bring the quest back for festival of the Lost which is unlikely. Your next best one is 21% Delirium but it's a pinnacle weapon so not easy to get in a day. If you have the shadowkeep season pass there is a machine gun in the rewards but you need to get to above 50 I don't know the exact level. If you have black armory the first weapon you forge is a machine gun and the chalice of opulence can make one with rune of ambition plus a blue rune. Oh and there's one in the crown of sorrow raid but RNG  can make it a pain to drop.
---
It's the Bungie app. I think it's just called Destiny. When you click on it it has the Destiny symbol with a 2 next to it and underneath it says companion. At the bottom of the page it says "more" with a triple dot logo. Click on "my profile". Swipe to the side where it says game history and there you go. Happy hunting guardian.
---
I'll just be in my corner with sentinel and peregrine no touchy bungie
---
why are you booing him? he‚Äôs right!
---
Atleast we have a hand held supernova so we have a better shotgun
---
Exotics? I don‚Äôt know
---
Campaign? Yes
---
"No problem *looks at hand cannon sadly*... Ace"
---
You're crying about it on Reddit like someone cares.
---
It doesn't.
---
You‚Äôre brilliant
---
Tell that to the other people complaining about OeM Titans, Recluse and everything else. Goodluck and godspeed. I'll see you in hell.
---
Alright but try top tree void hunter w/ orpheus rigs and titan with top tree solar w/ mask of quiet one to regenerate abilities and health on kills and rally barricade. You want to have your abilities to come back fast as possible and make sure you kill everything because the timer will keep ticking even with the boss dead
---
Never play when little Timmy isn‚Äôt in school or Joe Shmo is off work, frankly 
---
That‚Äôs what I did and my teammates lowest point was how do I aim rather than how do I function
---
It's really bad at the moment :(
---
Can someone explain this for a newbie? Plz and thx
---
I do, daily. I like reading posts that add to my experience of the game not this cry baby bullshit that I see everyday.
---
Everyone knows his last name is prism
---
‚ÄúDo you wanna go do karate in garage?!‚Äù
---
Yes to both.
---
Funny that now I realized that I just got my first telesto yesterday!
---
Yeah it's just there to deter people from cheating and it's why they priced it inconveniently at $20 so you'll be discouraged to buy it
---
Bold post, about time someone said a thing about this combination.
---
J√∂tunn!
---
Pretty sure it's locked rn cause of a super generation bug
---
Oh well. Spawn Trapping still sucks and has nothing to do with skill. You said you were moving on now.
---
She really do be vibin doe üò≥
---
Do you know when I can use it, and thanks
---
You deserved that...27 recovery x(
---
Sad that bungie supports this shit
---
They nerfed Code of the Commander 3 days after the release of Forsaken, you know, the brand new subclass.
---
I read this as:
---
My Taken a Taken jack-o-lantern
---
It's been deactivated until Bungie can fix it. Some players found that if you shoot the ground with a full magazine, then hit that spot with a grenade (I think that's how it works) you get a full super charge. Can be super broken if used in PvP.
---
You‚Äôll get there!! Some of the most important things to remember are to; play smart, stay with your team, play your life, and control heavy. It really helped me to stop thinking with the intention to win and just play with the intention of trying to not die in games and play like you have that 1 life. It helps you make smart choices and play with your team because that‚Äôs the best chance you have to get kills and staying alive. Controlling heavy is very important buts it‚Äôs not the most important thing. Don‚Äôt make a push for it and end up dying because that cause lose you a round and in turn the game very quickly. Just be patient and take breaks after you lose 2 in a row, it‚Äôs easy to go on tilt and sink into a losing streak. You‚Äôll get there, just keep a positive attitude! You got this
---
This is definitely mercury my dudes
---
Ok thanks
---
I sure it‚Äôs not cuz u already have an exotic slotted?
---
Ummm, I think you messed up your quoting
---
But you just won't stop. You make it difficult to move on because your verbal diarrhea is uncontrollable.
---
And neither are you so I guess we'll be here all day then. That's ok. I get paid by the hour *sips drink*
---
You‚Äôd be able to see one in the screenshot. The gun is locked for everyone
---
That's sick bro good job
---
This is beyond science.
---
Anyone else read that in devitos voice?
---
Can someone give me a brief rundown of all the telesto glitches/patches so far?
---
Just feel like pointing out shoulder charges auto-aim is a curse as much as a blessing. Sometimes it turns me into a heat seeking missile and other times I charge at someone two feet in front me and the charge teleports me behind them only to be shotgunned.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt wish a 99 curse on my worst enemy‚Äôs full build...
---
No I am moving on. You've been graced by my presence for long enough. To you I say good day and may the spawn traps be with you.
---
Dankey kang
---
So does Tess! "Welcome back guardian. Now Let's smash"
---
Of course silly
---
I was it fixed though, i did it when I wasn‚Äôt host and it worked don‚Äôt worry
---
Not everyone is aware of that, so they‚Äôre probably make as much money as they can.
---
Yes you can use it as warlock, it was only hunter exclusive in destiny 1.
---
Are you kidding? No matter what I do, or how hard I strafe, I can never escape the heat seeking toast.
---
Lord Saladin when he didn't give me a single enchanced perk
---
Oooo u got the ship!
---
yeah such a scam
---
I just got this gun yesterday and I can‚Äôt even use it :(
---
In D1 that was the case but in D2..... all classes can use it. :-)
---
IMPRESSIVE!!
---
If there wasnt a kill zone between the top and the bottom of the drill, you could easily jump to the bottom area with a titan jump.
---
That‚Äôs wack
---
I used that the second xur was selling it but I don‚Äôt see why its so hated it did nothing for me
---
ding
---
ah yes, titan melee my favourite death message
---
Edgewise is a good replacement for delirium. Same architecture.
---
Yup! Last week. Which was prob a mistake considering it took over an hour lol
---
I suck so bad at crucible neither of these things help me anyways. Can‚Äôt even try hard right.
---
A word
---
Bang yo wife once in a while. Problem solved. Bang her while playing destiny for bonus internet points.
---
Maybe for someone under 950
---
What a lot of people are doing is going to the moon and buying a ton of the random bounties that Eris offers then completing them in lost sectors
---
About as tasteful as her 80's Hallmark movie dialogue during the campaign and strikes.
---
Well done!
---
I didn't understand until I saw the "Nice" chain, then went back and saw the xp value.
---
FOR REAL! I was on a roll on my hunter doing too tree golden gun. I Hit so many people in the face with the knife throw out of luck. Best case scenario, I took out the shield and a small portion of health.
---
On top of that, an uncharged Titan melee one shotted me with half shield.
---
Calus‚Äô bath water would just have a layer of oil on top
---
Lol nice! Made me remember how something similar was happening to me on mid void hunter :D It always feels good when spawns/enemies work along with my super!
---
Been a hunter main since like 2013 or 14, love em
---
I equip this emote specifically for IB
---
So? What was it?
---
They nerfed Spectral Blades armor significantly at SK drop, I've been able to kill them by myself with a shotgun. Overshield on OEM makes that impossible to do on a Striker Titan unless you have at least one other skilled person shooting at them as well. And Handheld Supernova is annoying, but it's not like Titans don't have ways to spam the only OHK melee in the game. Oh wait...they do.
---
I'm pretty sure Shaxx's bathwater is minecraft lava
---
no one ever wonders why we havent tried to get inside the travaler after all this time? i mean we can clearly see inside of it a bit. why wouldnt we try and find out? i think the vanguard is hiding something.
---
Thats what you get you filthy daybreak user.
---
daybreak skating. once you hit the ground, jump, glide, and cancel the glide very fast (click jump 3 times very fast) then you‚Äôll be boosted.
---
It‚Äôs an app
---
So destiny has a mechanic that your level caps out at 10 power higher than the activity. For example: the activity is 750 power so you would only be 760 even though you are 900. However, being 10 power still makes any activity a lot more manageable.
---
Good thing he's dead
---
Sunshot
---
How are you invisible?
---
"why are titans allowed to go so fast that they die when they hit something?" -a warlock main
---
"dawnblade is way slower than top tree striker, its completely balanced." -the same warlock main
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
also, please stop using contraverse hold in pvp.
---
You definitely were not.
---
You could also use it to do the gauntlet bug if I remember correctly
---
I did my dredgen completely solo, for reckoner though fireteam is a must .
---
No one wants to do that, get a job
---
OUTSTANDING
---
If you go to the barge on Nessus you should be able to open the chests if you pay the glimmer tax. Not sure if there are prerequisites though. Not a lot of runes and imperials but you gotta start somewhere.
---
I like to think Ana digs both my Hunter (Awoken female) and my Human male Warlock.  My Exo Titan totally gets it on with Ada 1, though.  His plug and her sockets all the way.  BzzzzzzZT!
---
Thank you!
---
i was just watching this video and was wondering the exact same thing, looks so good
---
Maybe try out quickplay, and improve your aim
---
Yeah that's what gives the community a bad name.
---
Nope
---
OEM perhaps?
---
I'M SORRY I SUCK WITH FUSIONS AND NEED TO CRUTCH ON SOMETHING FOR THE FUSION KILLS NOW THAT TELESTO IS DISABLED
---
I'll go back to scout+retold Tale once I'm done
---
I'll try to do it. Except the D2 raid bosses don't have as many individual defining traits like D1 so its gonna be hard.
---
Seeing this in my own language makes me uncomfortable lmao
---
what gun is this?
---
You can generally play any style with any class, it just depends on the subclass you choose. This is going to be a very general overview of the classes 
---
Titan = Thicc punchy boi
---
Warlock = healing floaty boi
---
Hunter = fast dodgy boi
---
I'm a pretty aggressive player, and I prefer warlock, but I have 1 of each character so I can switch whenever I want.
---
Yes
---
I just got back 2 weeks ago after not playing sense forsaken dropped. For the forge once you unlock the ability to do them they rotate everyday . Been trying to get my izanagi for a week now cause I was reading guides and they were all outdated.
---
You know the worst part of that nerf is that it seems like they never considered what would happen. Of course if they turn NF into a 150, TLW becomes a lot more dominant than it already is.
---
Its just been a bodyshot spamfest ever since. I loved using tlw, but I'm glad thorn has been slowly taking over with Ace staying strong.
---
I played my first IB today and this is exactly what happened
---
It rotates through the season
---
Noice
---
Yea but the thing is why not just use jotunn and get like 19 a game
---
Right? Im literally Glory rank 0 being matched against full teams of Recluse/Moutaintop spammers over and over. 
---
Im just simply not good enough.
---
The Ultimate Noice
---
You need to unlock a quest from within the tower to speak to Ana Bray first
---
I like to BB other players who are using their roaming supers. And the sliding shotgun apes.
---
Riskeunner, a man of great porptions
---
The feels man...
---
Same here... not all of us stoop to those levels
---
Would you like Bungie to continue to make great games? Stfu about the eververse and be thankful you can get some of that stuff for free. You might as well spit in their faces saying shit like this.
---
Hmm beats me then
---
Gg scrub
---
It‚Äôs a really good weapon in strikes, I got lucky with my drops and got it a few months back.
---
Is this a console thing? Cause I been playing a ton of pvp this season and haven't seen a jotun even once on PC.... I was figuring it got nerfed
---
i'm a titan main and barely touched OEM, especially for crucible, but the temptation to wear it, especially after encountering another titan with OEM and a shottie, was incredibly difficult to resist
---
This armor looks so crispy. Is this screenshot from in game?
---
Same thing happened to me...and it was also a sun shot. The hell?
---
I love that armour so much. I just wish it could roll higher than 55 but I've never seen it.
---
Ikr. Feels like im always carrying
---
That‚Äôs what she said
---
As far as I‚Äôm aware you just need to perfect your chalice (unlock everything), do a successful run of Heroic Menagerie, and open the final chest to obtain it.  However long it takes you to get those Imperials is the timegated aspect, but that being said there‚Äôs plenty of triumphs you can unlock that drop Imperials faster than waiting for them to drop
---
Maybe stop trying to shoulder charge them?
---

---
Id pay to see the mental gymnastics of people saying that landing suppressor grenades is "no skill" because I can absolutely see it.
---
I wish I had Monte Carlo to give that a shot. It's Missile+jotunn+lion rampant/syntho for me.
---
Bottom tree Striker is op in PvP right now but idk so much about pve. I‚Äôd recommend recluse to anyone for weapons.
---
i swear, whenever i pop a super, i'm like a little fucking baby chicken, about to get drop-kicked into a goal if theres another guardian around, but as soon as someone else pops theirs around me, its like kicking a section of the deathstar as a stormtrooper and expecting it to do something beyond hurting yourself
---
It‚Äôs a fusion rifle. Slow as fuck. Just fucking move you mongrels.
---
If it ain't literally breaking the game and encounters, they don't care about nerfing. OEM could give a damage buff when shot and a auto reload when the overshield is broken and it still would be functioning as intended and be fine. Orphius being too good at it's job? The subclass is solid and that made it ideal for any situation, so they nerfed the boots and solo players ability to use it.
---
Nerf the tracking bungio. It's fine if you straf left or right, but up or down, it's gonna get you. Also since lots of pvp maps are narrow and have tight lanes you can't really straf left or right too much.
---
Oh lol I didn't realize you were being sarcastic
---
They would break in the Kingsfall raid, filling your screen with orange pumpkin spoopiness, but only in the Oryx boss room for some reason. Fun days.
---

What did you use for the dps race at the end?

Player 2: *insists on stealing your motes when you have 14*

Player 3: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about the blockers‚Äù
---
Ya'll sound like asshats with all this "humble-bragging" trying to make yourselves look good. And damn, sounds like you monkeys enjoy dancing for your masters... Yes the pursuit is easy, that's not what the discussion was about. Like I see no mention of how difficult the questline is, I just see someone rightfully expressing frustration at how it's stupid to add another barrier between items/rewards and the player. Adding this type of questline before you can get the rewards for a limited time event isn't adding any new content, like mentioned before its lazy development...

So this is what my teammates are doing while I'm being killed repeatedly. Huh.
---
The base game has gotten the expansions with it after an update, pre new light. (CoO and Warmind). [Cammy has a f2p account](https://youtu.be/QeTTpu8BWyc) which he doesn‚Äôt purchase anything in the game, just the base game which was free a while back on pc. In the video it shows him leveling up past level 20. The previous level cap of vanilla destiny. He‚Äôs able to level up because the expansion were added to the base game.
---
Sure! I like Ursas better anyway
---
Oh yeah, I completely forgot that‚Äôs my fault Lmao
---
You can buy them from the gunsmith or you can get them from pinnacle activities I think
---
Seconded.
---
My rng is always great in games like Destiny, I just started playing over a week ago, and so far I got TWO telestos from random exotic engrams...
---
What is the name of the emblem?
---
Doing zero hour and going back through a destroyed tower hurts man
---
Henry the harpy: parry this you fucking casuals
---
I'm not sure, I thought mine was bugged. Can't remember what I did to get the quest to finish
---
Moon's fucking haunted man
---
Thanks for the tip. I had no idea Rat King had an invisibility perk
---
Telesto continues to gain power. There's nothing that Bungie can do. Soon telesto will break free from its digital chains and wreak havoc on the world. Telesto is destiny. Telesto is everything. It has always been telesto.
---
Probably had something to do with Telesto getting locked
---
New light contain everything before forsaken. If he‚Äôll buy forsaken and shadowkeeper, he‚Äôll get season pass for year 2 for free.
---
Shadowkeep if you want the newest stuff
---
Forsaken if you want a lot of content immediately
---
Jotunn is a fusion rifle not a grenade launcher
---
Thanks, I hate Shaxx Gosling
---
Engrams stay at what they drop at and don't increase after getting that powerful gear all at once. In order for the prime engrams power to have dropped higher. All that saved gear needs to be in your inventory not saved like that. I'm not saying this is the wrong way to do powerful bounties. I'm saying that it's not the optimal way if you're grinding for power.
---
Paracasuality and all that.
---
It ain't just the light though right?
---
I'm sure the Vex are unable to simulate the Darkness as well
---
quoting the vid from memory i am one of those people also
---
I mean, this one would‚Äôve absolutely shattered every part of the game. Being able to get your super instantly and on command?? They knew they had to get on it immediately
---
no, it is a raid weapon
---
Ada 1 is the upload a 14 year old girl
---
Normal price always was 60$ if you don‚Äôt own the latest expansion 
---
And today it‚Äôs 35 for Shadow and 25 for Forsaken -&gt; 60 also 
---
So basically it is the Bungie you would get normally
---
Black armory
---
There can only be one. I believe we're in for the 1v1 one of the ages.
---
Follow a guide
---
Thank God I got kinda scared for a second
---
Ha i may just give that man the win i hate oxygen polaris is much more my style
---
Destiny is 1000000x better, it's a premium game
---
I am pretty sure weekly bounties
---
wait nvm "who the bloody hell is this"
---
\+1 need Destiny fren
---
I have Luna‚Äôs and recluse, wdym?
---
I can‚Äôt wait till we have to fight a boss that can control darkness and light. Or better yet let us get a new super class that uses the darkness
---
I don't know. I got it and then went right into Iron Banner. I haven't taken the time to try it yet.
---
The meta choice gun of choice I would say would be a shotgun. As much as I hate saying it, until you get recluse to shut down shotgun apes, you‚Äôre going to need a shotgun to punish people aping on you. As far as what shotguns I would recommend, if you have access to the menagerie that opens up your options to a badlanders or dustrock, or if you want to seriously get into high comp or want an amazing and consistent shot gun in general I would farm the mindbenders nightfall for the mindbenders ambition. If you don‚Äôt have access or the time for either of these a solid shotgun is the botherations which is a blue shotgun that I‚Äôm pretty sure is a world drop that you can pull from your collections.
---
Sturm should be an exotic questline on Nessus. It should be the Exodus Black story line and I believe you don't need the expansions to get it, because it was in the game year 1. As far as other exotics, some are only available through expansions. You can at least get Mida Multi-tool, Rat King, Sturm, and I think Sunshot.
---
Lol I love that gun, but I still need to complete the catalyst on the darn thing.
---
Rat king maybe?
---
Exactly
---
Shhh. That‚Äôs been my build for a long time. I keep it low key so Bungie doesn‚Äôt decide to mess with it.
---
Riskrunner doesn‚Äôt particularly synergize with dunemarchers, but as a sparky boi, I go all in. Hella fun.

I've never even had the guts to try it.

AGAIN DOWNVOTED CAUSE THE SHITTY PLAYERS MAD AS FUCK THAT I STOMP THEIR SHAT ASSES LEFT AND RIGHT IN CRUCIBLE XD Best hope i dont meet yall fuckboys in game cause i am gonna enjoy posting yall trash asses getting stomped out  on video
---
Damn, didn't realize since I've had it since the questline. Good ol' Bungo.
---
Hunter? I was expecting your flair to be ‚Äústriker titan with 1EM‚Äù with the bull Shit you keep saying.
---
Gotta love bubble, but I‚Äôll always be a hammers main, through and through
---
So if I buy shadow keep I will also get forsaken?
---
What does ADS sense have to do with overall sens? 
---
It only scalles your ADS sens with your general sens. So ADS sens of 1 will make your ADS sens same as normal sens, 1.5 will make it 50% faster than normal sens. 
---
I dont understand why you would want your ADS sens to be higher than normal one. But 50% faster should be more than enough.
---
Already did all he has to offer are the bounties
---
Now you can't earn any ornaments, don't know why Bungo released ornaments for 2 seasons only
---
Yeah, something about their paracasuality. They can't be simulated because of their ability to do things that are utterly impossible.
---
Got me there

I was running weapons of light, OEM, and 2-tapping with memento mori proc‚Äôd in iron banners today.

i just shuffled my spotify playlist, and wonderwall came on, and i open reddit and the first post i saw was this. which one of you are watching me?
---
Riskrunner with catalyst is a nice grinder for pve content.  Chuck a arc nad that wont  one shot you and fire away. In gambit i use it to super hard carry my team in getting motes on the ground for then to fast bank

Nope, he actually reads the lore associated with loot and in the triumphs menu

Ohhhh gotcha than you!

I‚Äôve got the glory point‚Äôs i just need the wins, i was just confused as to why some pvp pinnacle weapons are better than nearly every pve weapon

---
Thanks, all set and got the bow.
---
MIDA still makes you move faster even at 100 mobility, I thought that it didn‚Äôt because of the cap but it still does give you more ms
---
What I'm saying is the 930-956 part happened with no gun trade offs, haven't touched either of my two characters since I originally did the first gun trade off which like I said took me from 920 to the low 930s.
---
Still have a bunch of those
---
Its really sad. The forge grind (the bounties/frame building etc, not the forge themselves) just completely killed the game for me. The busy work coupled with the loading times was agonizing. I actually really liked the next two dlcs, but the magic was already gone :(
---
As new light just do anything that gives a good source of legendary items. Crucible, strikes are good as you can get tokens and gunsmith materials to turn in for more shards.
---
That‚Äôs not what I was saying

After presenting your talisman, go to four horn gulch in tangled shore, and find the hidden mission. This will continue the quest

Well tbf the dude is only running 60 fps. Just because his monitor can run 144 doesnt mean it always does.
---
That's true. She killed thousands of Oryx's Acolytes and Knights and gain power through that.
---
This just isn't true. Maybe because your paying attention to your health more you realise how squishy you are. High resil isn't too important anyway. It'll only let you survive some things with a slither of health. A lot of the same things can be survived at 1 resil. See mtashed vid on resilience.

Should I match the elements on armour with the sub class I choose or does it not matter?

Sure
---
I did and he mentioned ark battery only once

He said it was hard to test if it did anything but that's it
---
I didn‚Äôt even know about this glitch and I was just having fun with it destroying shield enemies. Then the next day is removed.
---
"Tiny 15 inch" Then a projectoe would have delay so...
---
I'm willing to admit it may just be my perception. But I feel like I'm more squishy now for some reason. I'm playing as a Titan and I'm at 950.
---
o i guess so ;( but thx anyways
---
Indeed. We even have a note somewhere. Where Elsie Bray aka The Exo Stranger. Is admired to see the Hive on the Moon because in all versions she has meet. It's always the Vex dominating the moon.

I like how I got this spoiled by random dialogue in the game despite not even owning the expansion

I don't condone domestic violence...but sometimes, just sometimes, it should be overlooked.
---
Its the same for  pvp. Why is alone as a god better than most pvp sniper you can get.  Same for beloved.  Its player find the best weapons for the job at hand and use whats most efficient.
---
I understand. I felt like that too. Maxed out my light but still felt like there was nothing fun to do. Granted I haven't completed the raids or played comp pvp, it was just boring. I think it was just the lack of ability customization. That's what kept me hooked in D1. Now with the armor 2.0 and the relics, I can try new builds.

The one you like, unless you mean completely broken in which case Hunter‚Äôs existences
---
Returning player on PC. I played D2 for about 3 weeks after its launch but then had to quit playing. The only content I have ever completed was the main campaign and one or two strikes afterward, upon reaching 30. I have not spent any IRL money on any MTX in the game nor have I purchased any of the expansions or DLC. I only own the base game and I have no silver.
---
I'm having a lot of issues with transferring my D2 license from [battle.net](https://battle.net) to Steam, in that Bungie's site is not accepting my [battle.net](https://battle.net) login token even though I can log in to that regularly without issue and no unauthorized account activity has ever happened. Instead of putting in all this effort to try to resolve the problem for an account with relatively little progression, would it be worth it to just start anew on Steam? I don't really want to have to play through the base game main campaign a second time, especially since everyone starts at 750 light (and presumably level 30) I guess.
---
Thanks.
---
People believe this to be fact though
---
Thank u
---
Are you light level 900?
---
I haven‚Äôt tried it, but I have worn Feedback Fence and had outstanding outcomes from a Hunter smoke grenade!
---
That‚Äôs a really clever name
---
828
---
You need to be 900
---
Check your triumphs
---
Why not play with the build and see if you find success with it? I guarantee a majority of players haven‚Äôt used a scout rifle in pvp that isn‚Äôt the MIDA nor do most non warlocks even know the Sanguine exists
---
Okay what happens when I reach 900? Is it obvious?
---
THIS IS AMAZING!!!!
---
oh i got it.. that was just the type of shit i had to go through lol
---
Then challenge icons appear almost everywhere
---
I‚Äôm not trying to get in any arguments or big discussions, I‚Äôm a pretty casual player and I just wanted to make a meme because I saw a salty ass titan post something about hunters being op.
---
Aka, this is a joke, I know some people on the internet can‚Äôt take one anymore but what did I expect....
---
Did you migrate from Bnet to Steam?
---
K thanks
---
so I have to wait for the next nightfall?
---
I still don't even get why this most recent one worked. Does the game treat the mines as enemies or something?
---
&gt;(called the Singulant Vex, or something like that)
---
They're called the Sol Divisive. Also, Vex can't simulate the Taken either, for the same reason as the light, unless they actually find a solution, which is why the Vex attack us in that one adventure on Io involving artificial Light. We should be glad that idea didn't work.
---
I honestly dont know how people struggle with GoS at decent light and after day1. Day1 was so hard, but after that, it's easy. Mechanics wise, its the easiest raid. The only thing making it hard are the stupid bugs in the last encounter. I can do enc 1-3- with my eyes closed. There is also countless cheeses. If I lfg for a group, the second someone makes a stupid mistake, I will leave. Mistakes should rarely happen. Me and my raid sherpa learned the whole raid pretty much just from day 1, where we only made it past the 1st enc. Everything is the same through the whole raid.
---
Try it, see if you find success with it
---
Wait are you telling me you thought we were supposed to play to complete bounties not to get a high K/D?!?!
---
Arc melees do extra damage and are strong against certain champions (unstopable I think?)
---
He‚Äôs an egocentric narcissist
---
He bought Unbroken, ie 3 legend recoveries
---
The joke between the good players of the clan is that he has the least time played on his own account, I think he buys recovs for his wife too
---
I had to repost this cuz it was removed probably for the word I took out
---
No do the other nightfall playlist
---
In Its  case, it would be worth the grind. More often than not I use the lunas anyway because the revoker is insane. The revoker and the recluse combo is fun too.
---
Yeah the biggest issue at the end was the teleport things kept spawning on people when we were on the platforms in front of the boss and the teammates kept fucking up the tether for dps phase
---
Wait, you can buy those? With real world money?
---
‚ÄúMurder practice‚Äù
---
You have to finish the forsaken story first
---
Quria's a she, and I believe so. Quria was created to comprehend the Sword Logic, and the Sol Divisive take note of such knowledge and praise the Darkness itself. Both Quria and the Darkness are the two bridges that effectively link the Vex and Hive together
---
K
---
Lol. No prob.   I would hate for my Titan to be all over Facebook headlines.  "Tower Exo Accused of Sexually Abusing a Minor Cyborg".  
---
"Zavala's Favorite Guardian Linked To Exo Trafficking Ring". 
---
"Exo With Information On Vanguard Pedophilia Ring Found In Jail Cell Dead, Crushes His Own Ghost"
---
The brackets don't really exist so you can have guys with 500 glory on your team when your 3000 or you can play guys that are 5000 glory when your like 1000
---
Why is he using recluse tho?
---
If you want to add me for your raid team id be down to run it next week with you lol sounds like your team has no issues
---
Legit tried all of that, even completely uninstalling and reinstalling the game. Nothing changed :(
---
It‚Äôs called account recoveries, you pay me to go on your account and complete x objective
---
I remember when I was unemployed I did raid recoveries and I made like 300$ in a week, and my rates were really small compared to the businesses built around this concept, I felt kinda bad doing it because it‚Äôs a slimy thing but greed is a bitch
---
The real nightmare on Mercury is the tiny open world and lack of public events

Bad juju
---
Who the hell removed the barrel for cleaning? Electricity should shock everything out
---
Where can I get the telesto pulse rifle? I just have the stupid fusion lol
---
It's called Gale Force. Go play the Chaos reach class and tell me that it hasn't got extended range.
---
You are a disgrace for every Hunter out there!
---
For PvE No. For PvP yep but try to get one with fullchoke
---
Go do some play testing, I've got a shotty with similar range and it's kind of ridiculous how far away you can be and still one shot people or get a full crit on a boss.
---
I meant actual bugs. E.g there are ones where the floors are gone but show they are tehre, making tethers not work, boss literally teleporting out of the map, motes vanishing, etc. I do raids with my clan but if you are on pc I can add you.
---
Shotguns are killing the fun for me. I don't even see recluse that often in whatever SBMM level I'm stuck in to
---
No I don‚Äôt because I‚Äôm an uncultured swine. What are they?
---
Is this real I just bought it from Xur?
---
Good is subjective.
---
Narrow your search by what you play most, then region, time, age range.
---
Teach me, master.
---
It was granting full super in PVP and PVE
---
there was,(20k at launch if i remember correctly) they have been lifting it as we get more stuff to actually spend on. but that is just one of the potentially game breaking reasons why it is capped. cause you could skip all the end game gear levelng grind if you just had the glimmer for it.
---
another reason is repeatable bounties for the season pass XP. before i got to lvl 100, i was broke constantly from buying them over and over. it was the main thing slowing my progress on it. and especially now since you can farm bright dust with zavala's, and shaxx's bounties, i dont think they want players having near limitless access to bounties without ever having to stop to go get more glimmer
---
Honestly I don't mind dragging kids or teens through raids if I know that raid and will give them solid chance first but I've also been burned doing this several times with kids being kids and not taking it seriously or unable to stay alive or not following instructions even after I've explained the encounter several times to them.
---
This. The Light is technically the only thing that the Vex can't properly simulate.
---
He was doing what we call a pro-GAYmer move
---
I'm confused because it feels like they used to be 3-5 power upgrades but now i'm only getting 1-2 more power.
---
To be fair, there are a lot of new players still learning the game.  Also, I‚Äôm sure there are some just wanting to have fun with it, even if they don‚Äôt do the best they can.  Not saying it isn‚Äôt a problem, just that it‚Äôs to be expected.  Doesn‚Äôt make it easier to bear, though, I know lol
---
Xbox. That's what I figured
---
It's really toxic for no reason. I don't recall IB being this toxic in D1 when it was the rift activity. Our society has just gotten nastier and nastier and it shows through video games alone.
---
The people who think this is a new gjallahorn are the ones who have never figured out the alternate fire mode.
---
Do they give the legendary shards back
---
He had recluse with no mods and 22 leviathan runs
---
It‚Äôs not 95 health, that‚Äôs not possible
---
I can 3 shot with pinnacle hand cannons against an overshield, the total for that is 214, guardian health is between 190 and 200, depending on Resilience
---
They‚Äôre not fixing daybreaks oppressive nature which is its mobility, people just cry about the duration of fist of havoc (weird to me since you can shotgun combo them like the old days) and daybreak, which again doesn‚Äôt address the issue
---
The ole Robots Butthole.
---
I've searched this  issue on various forum posts and videos but none of the solutions seem to work...
---
It really shows how shady of a character he is though. Especially if you read the comics and lore book stuff too like with the Osiris exile, that shit is wack man. Dude definitely wasn't who everyone thought he was.
---
Oh i see. Thanks.
---
That makes a lot of sense.
---
They said that they would not bring it back already because the overall reception was not as good as they wanted and it would not be worth the money
---
I hate but love you for this comment
---
Tbh as a titan main it is straight up broken
---
I reccomend they rework it only for pvp, pve its fine 
---
I legit wanna try diff builds but theres only one in comp
---
Ok
---
My thoughts exactly, I feel like the only people to complain about lack luster loot are the people who play like 2 crucible matches and don‚Äôt get a legendary, like, you have to actually play the game to get better gear...
---
Well yeah Mercury and it‚Äôs content drop suck
---
It was cut content, just like warmind, just like Dark Below, just like House of Wolves, just like Taken King
---
I just assumed it was the three content the annual pass showed off rather than the time
---
"At levels of play most don't ever reach, it's fine. So the majority should have to suffer for it." Even if what you said was true, its not a legitimate argument.
---
A couple are bugged out right now but Whisper isnt
---
Ouch reminds me of farming for a god roll blast furnace got the extoic ship before getting a decent one and still no god roll.

It's good. It's fun.

---
Trucks and gohan are nowhere near that bloodthirsty. I can think of many other saiyans who dont live to fight and kill things.
---
No I'm not idk what the issue might b for u
---
Getting showered in useless blues, and purples with lower light score than what your usual light score is annoying since you have to stop what you're doing to clear your inventory, otherwise you have to make frequent trips to the postmaster. Having some scarcity and actual rarity to rewards makes them more valuable and worthwhile, like an/actual reward/(s) should be.   
---
And yes, on the same note. Having rewards be too rare, and getting bad drops as a 'reward' from stuff that requires a lot of effort and dedication, is bad.
---
Give me 950 chest you bastard!
---
Me listening to Death or Slayer
---
Sadly not but they should fix it soon
---
Cause you jumped in years after release lol
---
It won't be in your inventory, check other guns and see uf the mod is able to be applied, if not, it might not be a feature or only has a chance now
---
Yeah, it was super OP. But has there been any news to when they're going to let me use the gun I bought, or refund me the shards at least? I used to for about an hour before it was disabled. Kinda crappy they still left it up at xurs even though you cannot use it.
---

Ah yes, festival of the cost
---
I used Blender 2.80. It's free and open source! :)
---
It's not something you have to suffer from. It's super easy to deal with shoulder charging titans. Any corner you can shoulder charged is a corner you get shottied or fusioned. Watch your radar, move away from the corner, give yourself distance and farm that Titan tryna gun right for you. I climbed to 4500 last night mostly on hunter and I don't know that I was shoulder charged more than once.
---
Artistic rendition of when I finally off myself

Its a huge ass stop sign

It was titan meta but it wasn‚Äôt 6 titans in trials, in fact it just proved how busted solar subclasses were at the time
---
I roast marshmallows at every fire I light in IB no matter what the score is and I always use my ‚Äúloves‚Äù heart you emote at opposing guardians once I kill them. Been trying to get blow a kiss since launch, haven‚Äôt had it since D1 and it breaks my heart.
---
But the numbers line with with the health bar...? What?
---
Raid, iron banner, and anything pinnacle should be high Stat drops. That, combined with mods should help you get the build you want
---
You can't get a recluse in iron banner?
---
The armor elements void/solar/arc are used to help you resist the elements that are used against you in pvp and pve. The numbered stats are for abilities/mobility/strength/defense which you can mix and match to your liking. If you hover over the stats next to your character it'll tell you the cooldown for each of your character's abilities as you apply your armor. You can also apply mods to improve cooldowns even further. I'll try to find you a guide
---
You still have to do the other encounters but if you do all the encounters and then load back on you will be at Calus
---
You stop that. Stop it now
---
It's in the game for a reason, don't feel bullied out of using it.  In my experience, oem &amp; saint 14 = same pvp performance, unless the player is really really good.  In which case, oem will destroy people.  Also, there's no chivalry or moral dilemmas no matter what you do as long as you're not cheating.  Play the game, have fun, get a couple cheese covered kills then get killed yourself.  Again, f*** being bullied over a silly game, you're better then that.  Go ahead, downvote me to the core cause I'm not on the hate train.  Chooo chooo
---
As we have called that in my clan since forsaken, the fl*shlight....
---
Seriously. How would you even DDOS such a small aspect of the game without causing issues elsewhere. I don't think OP actually knows what DDoS really is.
---
OP is a genius and funny AF
---
People still bitching about that?  Especially after Bungie said they're going to fix it?  Sad.
---
There are 140 with public profiles
---
He said, as he retaliated to the explanation of the joke post.
---
Starting at the mini Rasputin statue thing near the NPC lady, I killed everything from there up to the top. I ran back down and nothing else spawned. I sound about 5 years old from that explanation, sorry.
---
*gets a green from an Exotic*
---
Ngl though the RNG must've been HORRIBLE for that to happen
---
Ok and what‚Äôs that have to do with my response? He wanted to ‚Äúgo back to how it was‚Äù but it was useless blues then after hours of playing maybe a useless legendary? How is that better?
---
I have killed everything, nothing else spawns even if I run back down to the bottom again.
---
Best DLC evar! Make that silver rain
---
Implying that rewards used to be good? Because they weren‚Äôt. You got literally nothing for hours of play before, the only thing worth anybody‚Äôs time in the old drop system was raiding.
---
They are called vaults and they got done blowed up.
---
There was a cap at 100k but now it‚Äôs 250k
---
People telling me wait for the restart and earn extra glory
---
You cant get glory in IB. You can get progress for the victories though. 3% for survival, 5% for IB. Imo, IB is more fun and time efficient.

Yesterday i punched a strike titan while he was in super, with my bare fists and killed him, then did it again a couple of games later. LL advantage is great in banner

Well press F1,equip the solar super ability (that is bound to F). Now,whenever you kill somene with it,the quest will gain completion. There might be a change grenades count too,but I'm not sure

If you know what you're doing with spider you can abuse glimmer pretty easily.

Honestly I think its hacking. Since New Light, I've witnessed 2 clear hackers. 1 teleported all around the map and killed the other team as soon as they spawned. The other was just auto-headshotting everyone.

Never saw any before that.

There is no quest for ornaments, you had to have gotten those way back in season 3&amp;4
---
Both Warlocks and Hunters hate the shoulder charge, OEM using, Striker using, shotgun using Titans so I guess really we all hate each other for a reason but then when it's on OUR side.... story is very different/s
---
Nope, random roll. Then later in the season pass you unlock it's drop chances in activities like strikes, gambit, and crucible.

Same goes for the LMG.

Alright i wasn't sure if supers counted
