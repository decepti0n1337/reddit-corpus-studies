Not at all actually! But I do disagree with you that the 3.0 was indeed helpful. And I rarely have a team of those knuckleheads, just one or two, and the rest of us can hold it down while they're doing whatever it is they're doing.... and don't get it twisted friend, the theoretical 3.0kd's are out there, reminding the rest of us how great they are üòÇ

---
Awesome clutch dude. I've only ever played on PC so to me it is even more impressive that you can play a game that seems to be made for mouse and keyboard on the console and still play well.
---
Because it went free to play and moved to Steam at the same time, it's hard to say exactly how much of an effect each had.
---
I thought the Galor was a cruiser class vessel used by the Cardassians.
---
It's the steady pan that gets me.
---
Thats.... descriptive
---
150 hours?  Lmfao.
---

---
I had 500 hours in Forsaken alone.
---
They're also one of the reasons I always have my Goldtusk on me, so I can sword block their attacks, which woks most of the time.
---
Eh Outbreak was all repatriation. You just gotta get the feel for the jumping down, after you hammer it into yourself you don't for get it and can practically speed run it.
---
Did it with a friend, had the same issue and he almost rage quit. I mostly stood against the wall behind the broken pillar closest to  the entrance so that I could choke the thralls to two easy-to-see paths. It also blocked off Lord-shriekers purple death stare for the most part...
---
Only pinnacle drops and the season artifact go past 950 I believe. You need to earn other gear thru pinnacle activities
---
Ophidia spathe sealed ahamkaras grasp you could load so many bullets in rockets made launchers Jesus
---
Always thought for just halloween day each year,it would be awesome if they would just let everyone wear any amount of exotics they want to "dress up" always thought it would be a cool thing for them to do
---
Let us change our characters appearance/race/gender if we want and make it cost legendary shards or something.
---
He must show his beautiful blue bald head at all times.
---
Nope last season I got one
---
You do not need shadow keep for the vex offensive. Just the season pass.
---
I too would like him to narrate my entire life
---
Platform?
---
Man, what is that hand cannon you are using? A triple shot hand cannon? I‚Äôm jelly and I want it
---
Lord shaxx... The only pvp announcer who actually did a good job at helping me rebuild my self worth after losing a match
---
Not a fan of the season/battle passes implementation. The people who pay get a lot more exotics, resources, armour, in-game currency than the people who don't. It doesn't look like it now but this is the start to pay-to-win.
---
Yeah.    I...   Yeah.  Don't get me wrong I loved playing destiny on ps4.  But PC is just... It's not better.  It's more responsive. Like I can do what I want with my character alot faster then I could on console.
---
Me using tractor cannon
---
Crotas End but with Hive?
---
oh yeah
---
TANG MAN
---
You will get Divinity
---
It costs 10 bucks. Nothing in the pass is game breaking, and you get a decent amount of free stuff. The only reason someone would complain is if they dont have the TEN dollars to spend on dlc lol and if thats the case, get a job and get some $
---
Regardless of the season, I still feel as if I should‚Äôve received something from that quest. I just pledged allegiance to the drifter and completed his quests. Plus, I don‚Äôt think I would‚Äôve made the vanguard too happy by picking the drifter‚Äôs side. I would‚Äôve expected to of been rewarded for my loyalty.
---
But it is what it is lol
---
You should get it
---
I'm feeling this with shattered throne rn, but mostly because I'm a 200 hour new light and didn't know what it was so I soloed it for an hour or two until the end and gave up for obvious reasons.
---
 Did it once with my friend, he gave up almost immediately after we died once on the petitioner 
---
Think I might just wait a bit for this fine addition to my collection...
---
I'll go for a bit. What are you playing on and what's your gamer tag?
---
Ok thanks
---
Thanks
---
Just did it tonight so happy. Thorn is incredible. We ended up camping on the hill with exotic bows and decent heavies &amp; supers.
---
Oh alright, thanks!
---
Just got mine today. It‚Äôs nice, Mr. Lahey.
---
Yep
---
Will Leviathan's Breath (exotic bow) become rare once the current season pass ends?
---
Nah he's supportive too, just in his own snarky way
---
There is "down to business", which is gold, and "go about your business", which is black
---
mainly because no matter how god you are, recluse has crazy range and dps in normal modes and in momentum its ridiculous, if you are med to CQC distance you better be a god with aim because otherwise you're getting toasted
---
Just got mine today doing momentum control, incoming jade rabbits!
---
And I say this as a titan
---
Yes I did get luna‚Äôs first
---
Texas red: *Heavy breathing*
---
recluse's MOA buff should not be proc'd by other weapons. Recluse is pretty mediocre without MOA buff, so forcing players to use it to get it seems like a good trade off. im fine with how mountaintop is. Its synergy with recluse is my only real problem. OEM needs to lose tracking or overheal. Personally id rather it lose tracking, since it punishes the enemy player for shooting you which is terrible game design
---
Not all of us like sucking dicks
---
Looks like outbreak perfected!
---
Oh man that's tough! I'm still working on mine. Need like 12 more body shot kills and 1000 glory
---
Grade-nades?üò±
---
From my experience, it's all based on time. If you can melee, Dodge, melee fast enough, absolutely. I often find myself doing this: melee, dodge, melee, dodge, melee, dodge, melee, (one two punch), melee, melee, (one two punch), melee, etc

Wire rifle vandals in d1 with arc burn was what i was scared of most

---
Players talking about the game and posting content and playing the free stuff inflates the playerbase numbers which attracts new players, plus eventually they will possibly pay for new stuff. Bungie lost nothing by giving away old product once they saw no way to monetize year 1.
---
So deep üò•
---
Is that Taylor on real housewives lol
---
Acolytes are scary now

D2s fault for not making it apperent what's needed for public events.

Direct hit one shots you tho, and I got 6 of m

Just trying to understand your point, but why do you need Shadowkeep to play Vex Offensive?
---
Aight I‚Äôm finna head out
---
Please tell me more about the comp meta?
---
From what I‚Äôve seen there‚Äôs a lot of different builds going so i don‚Äôt know why people cry about it
---
doesn't matter, he can make the weak spot
---
I prefer the shuro chi encounter in last wish. Also this is well known by now
---
I had the hunted playing in the background and it meshed well with the video
---
One thing I love about Destiny 2 is that it manages to be inclusive and non-problematic without being remotely obtrusive about it.
---
Characters are interesting and attractive without there being a single piece of beefcake or cheesecake fanservice. They have a racially diverse cast (both the characters and the voice actors), and it never feels out-of-place. Ikora, Ana Bray, Eris Morn, they kick ass and call shots and it never for a moment feels out-of-place. Shaxx is the very model of non-toxic masculinity and heaps supportive, platonic affection on your Guardian, and it doesn't feel weird at all. The characters are often flawed, but they suffer realistically from their flaws and in many cases they take pains to address them. 
---
And none of that is rubbed in your face. It is just woven into the narrative and left to stand as-is. I really admire how well Bungie pulled that off. I can't really call to mind another game that has done it as well and as thoroughly as Bungie has here.

I made this
---
I applaud anyone not using a scout rifle, but even 0.05 is a longer time to kill than Jade's (and every other SR) 0.0
---
Use recluse and don‚Äôt aim in. It helps with spatial awareness.
---
I definitely read that in his soothing fatherly tone
---
What platform are you on?
---
Not exactly, most regular average players probably don‚Äôt know this.
---
There IS a hydra chassis hanging in Shaxx's area in the Tower.
---
I have a quick launch/spike grenades/field prep/quickdraw.  I think it'll do, till i have a better one.
---
Ahhhh you're talkin PvP eh? Yeah it's pretty eh. Unless you're already using a good kinetic and using Recluse as a clean up for CQC, then you can just sweep people using Recluse under the rug. PvE is another story tbh. Thing is pretty busted in PvE but honestly I just use anything since it's PvE.
---
Spam that L1 and L2 lol
---
I have an exam in 30 mins really needed this
---
2 memes in a row with the same pic.... noice
---
When you do strikes you get 4-5 vanguard tokens which you must give to zavala at the tower (the awoken titan at the mid-bottom of the map, who looks over the city) every 20 tokens you give him, you get a legendary engram that will give you a random vanguard weapon or piece of armor. The system is the same for the crucible and every planetary seller (those will need about fifty of the planet's ressource to give you an engram)
---
#**YOU FIGHT LIKE AN ANIMAL**
---
OP, may I ask where the original meme is?
---
Hey thanks man, that really means a lot!
---
It'll be the Red war all over again but this time it's Vex's turn.
---
please no. if Shaxx is let loose he will eradicate the Darkness in like a week, I still want more years of content
---
Sorry, but the wing contender set is no longer in the loot pool. It may be in the future, but as of right now its unobtainable
---
What's this about midterms? WHAT ABOUT THE CRUCIBLE!?
---
That makes 2 of us
---
Needs more upvotes
---
*pulls out jade rabbit*
---
Someone robs you at night, just spray em with that. Good luck hiding from the cops.
---
Aw man, that sucks, thanks for answering though!
---
That reaction was priceless
---
Youre welcome.
---
But the game isn‚Äôt just about guns, there‚Äôs armor, light level, mods (for guns and armor) there‚Äôs masterworking a gun, not to mention all the exotic perks. Even classes differ, in speed, and how they jump. Plus play style, do you strafe when shooting, do you jump and shoot? What about sliding it crouching. Point is, there‚Äôs many ways to make Luna‚Äôs out gun that  eri. You make it sound like a ten pace dual.
---
Agreed.
---
Its a visual glitch
---
If it helps what I did was use izagamis burden in rumble with sniper rifle scavenger. Then get honed edge 4x so one shot body shot. Got about 10 kills a match with it.
---
The Levi quest was easy.. You could matchmake for it.
---
I don't care about the new tower, wreck it with the undying mind and give us the old one goddammit!
---
I am finally playing D1 now. I owned the collection because it was like 30 bucks on xbox once, but i had only played strikes with friends and then Wrath of the Machine. So much dying, not enough loot.
---
Killed by the architects
---
Is it worth doing the story (red war, warmind etc.) if you already leveled up to 900 doing other activities? Are there any rewards for completing the campaigns?
---
Not unless you have a NIGHTHAWK ON A WALKER
---
Id recommend that you guys check out some of his post history for r/destinythegame. I looked at most of his posts on there and almost every comment was either constructive criticism or someone adding to his idea. Only one of his ideas (which past particularly stupid) received any comments i consider even remotely dismissive. Not trying to defend the general subreddit, it just seems that he is butthurt that one (yes, only one) of his posts got negative reception.
---
Always knew shaxx was best character
---
Perks are:
---
Hard Launch
---
Spike Grenades
---
Field Prep
---
Full Court
---
Reload MW --- Velocity MW may be better here? idk though
---
Does devour grant bonus health? 980 knockout thralls will just instakill you
---
yeah most definitely, I got the same roll but with a velocity masterwork and it's nuts
---
You have to complete every quest step in order to get the chaperone and I don't think there is a need to explain the quest steps, its pretty straight forward.
---
Yeah. To earn more and therefore rank up more and thereby earn more loot. 
---
You also need multiple resets in a season for various triumphs and pinnacle weapons. 
---
There‚Äôs zero reason *not* to.
---
So you can continue to earn rank up rewards. There‚Äôs zero point in not resetting.
---
The reason why I tell my therapist about the ghosts I see when driving
---
I should upload the video of my opponent going off a cliff than be taken out by me. He/she basically gave me a big ‚ÄúF you, you don‚Äôt get to kill me, I kill myself.‚Äù
---
‚ÄúCayde-7‚Äù is not a thing that can happen. Rebot =/= resurrection.
---
I'm glad Bungi is keeping it a while. That way this fucking scout meta will be done before the next season. Everything trying to get Randys.
---
Nezarek's sin with wavesplitter and grenadier. That's all I'm gonna say.
---
ahh.
---
Either you completed the questline or it expired. Just check if you have unlocked the full set on your respective character
---
I like that he‚Äôs yelling.
---
They start once the PE chest disappears.
---
This mode is great for grinding mountaintop if you have a fighting lion
---
Good shit, man!
---
It‚Äôs not difficult, it just takes a long time and all of the weapons are mostly bad
---
Looks like you can bulls-eye womp rats in it.
---
Riskrunner devour?
---
I personally think the story makes it worth it. It really lets you get into your character and understand thr world a lot better. You can get some weapons, armor, and some XP out of it. 
---
The story is the main thing of this game. The rest is just kinda like side activities.
---
Explain Banshee, lol
---
Cool
---
r/imsorryjohn
---
I'm also on PS4 and wouldn't mind helping
---
Looks kinda like Sleeper Stimulant
---
Explain Banshee, then. Lol
---
It was objectively better than bubble because you had more health, could still shoot, and had as big a damage buff.
---
Now you wouldnt have hurt tony would you
---
*kid goes nuts and starts fighting professors *
---
**FIGHT FOREVER GUARDIAN!**
---
Do all the weekly powerful gear stuff.
---
Wait, read that wrong. Lol
---
If you have the Destiny app, there's the lfg feature in it that let's you join other people's posts for various activities, or make your own post and have others join you.
---
Small clip, no bonus damage, a waste of an exotic slot in PvE
---
Xbox
---
Once every slot has a 950 you go do an event that has Pinnacle Gear as a reward and it will drop a single 952 piece. Once everything has a 952, you start getting 954 as a Pinnacle reward. And so on until you hit 960. Gate Lord's eye adds ontop of that, so I think the total cap is 999? or something.
---
This isn't an LFG sub.
---
/r/Fireteams
---
We're fine guys, we're fine, we'll get it next try.    
---
Honestly, a good part of a raid leader is to determine if your group is capable of doing the encounter.
---
See this is weird for me.
---
Impo rampage is stomped by multikillclip but breakneck despite not having MKC seems to be a much more efficient killing machine.
---
Maybe it's the increase in ROF or the increase in reload but in all instances where I need AR kills it seems to me despite having a better perk for higher damage potential the werewolf just always comes up short
---
As the other redditor alludes to, our use of the Light makes us all but immune to Vex predictive models.  So the Vex are smart in situations outside of Guardian fights, but in Guardian fights they lose track of our present and future actions every time we light up a super, or toss a grenade, or create something with our class abilities.
---
I fail to see how that explained the other guy's remarks.
---
Dying gives the person who killed the OEM titan time to get their reload in, get a better position to fight this raging titan. Accidentally hurting an OEM titan should not reward the titan. 
---
I have had fights where I accidentally sprayed my smg and hit a titan in the background and he hunt me down and killed me in the next few seconds, sometimes while I was still fighting the other guardian.
---
And for some reason, has the same perks as the real OEM.
---
Sickkk! Keep it up üòé
---
"You are weak.  Undisciplined.  Cowering behind walls.  You're not brave, you've merely forgotten the fear of death.  Allow me to reacquaint you."

Say what you will about Ghaul, but that was one hell of a first impression.
---
cuz xur fukin broken
---
He straight thrall‚Äôin
---
At least it's fun
---
That's a technique, you can't get the shot if you are ROFL
---
He's trying to explain to you that the bonus that would be provided would cause the player to adopt a "suicide" strategy to purposely get killed and have a lower performance than how it is now where it rewards the player for being able to gun another guardian down in a fight.
---
Crop the image please
---
You know what? That's not a bad idea at all!
---
And then he got shit?
---
Nice
---
His sincerely hunter main. Fucking read damn it jeez.
---
You pretty much need to hug its asshole shooting unstoppable rounds as it chases your teammate spamming the Finisher button before it slams.
---
solution: play on console.
---
I'ma jump up this big bitch and STAB IT IN THE FACE
---
Yes
---
I‚Äôm at 5474 glory
---
Regardless, the ghost didn't die because Cayde called him out, it's because the Ghost was cocky and refused to be cautious of his positioning. Our ghost wouldn't make a reference to how cocky he was otherwise. And yea, the ghost agreed, Cayde didn't MAKE him come out like you said before. 
---
Watch your wording next time bud.
---
Maybe 5
---
What a hot take.
---
Does matter what glory you are currently at
---
lucky lol
---
It's a meme, not a fucking chart topping movie bud
---
That article is from 2016
---
Thought there was a way to get it without eververse but cheers
---
Cheers for the help
---
So uh, get the gun? If you think it's OP why not get it and use it? Problem solved. Nerfing everything is boring. Having some things stay in a flux of powerful and not powerful is healthy for a meta.
---
excuse me? noobtubers generally use GLs at stupid close ranges, don't compare us with those plebs.
---
What do you mean?  I‚Äôm just confused by the wording, no hostility meant :)
---
you can solo it, use a special grenade launcher with blinding from your collection, for the  shriekers, and just take ur time with everything, u can play hunter for the invisibility.
---
Wormhusk is somewhat meta in pvp rn
---
dont hate on the armor drops man, they have high chances for high stat rolls
---
Nope
---
I'm not sure the Tangled Shore was even worth fighting over, considering we inevitably secured Spider's cartel while we were there, so it may have all been a net loss for humanity.  If the Tangled Shore even had strategic value to the wider conflict against humanity's enemies.
---
I can see it from both Zavala and Ikora's perspective, but not really from Cayde's.  Not sure what Cayde would have done, if it was Ikora or Zavala being killed.  But would Ikora and Zavala even get mixed up in the Tangled Shore, or with Petra in the first place?
---
Recluse is pretty easy to play against though, either you engage with something like pulse or sniper out of its range, or get close range and just blast them with a shotgun.
---
I'm sad now.
---
thanks alot!
---
When a cop sees a black dude reeeaaally far away
---
Yes please
---
nice
---
After few weeks of play, I almost started to think there are no toxic players in destiny community, thank you for pulling me back to the earth.
---
Add me on steam? Velixas
---
no, guardian, the helmet is staying on during sex

No Land Beyond: hand cannon edition

Whining was always the top method to farm upvotes on Destiny subs.
---
How many times will we see this repost before people will finally start downvoting this D1-old joke to the ground?
---
Did you mean a guy called ‚Äúfuny steam name‚Äù?
---
Cause if so that‚Äôs pretty hilarious indeed.
---
I soloed it too and it was the most painful 4 hours of my life
---
Honestly idk
---
Most people ignore the objectives looking for a chance to slay out. That‚Äôs fair if you‚Äôre dropping 30+ defeats at least. But it usually doesn‚Äôt go that way.
---
What? Neither gun you mentioned are OP in PVP. Ace kinda used to be, but Izanagi's is awful in PvP.  Izanagi's is just for top DPS PVE.
---
big boi question rn
---
U mad?
---
Same feels with blade barrage. Love it!
---
well played! you stayed cool , played smart , excellent win!
---
i hate people like you tbh xD and all raiding community hates entitled newbies that think "oh i want that gun you have to help me!!!!!!!!!!!" WE DON'T WANT TO CARRY YOUR ASS THRU A RAID just so you can get 1 weapon and waste 6h of our time bcuz you don't understand raid mechanics =) 
---
but if you do wanna carry just pay someone for it 
---
either find sherpa LFG or pay or find 5 other newbies like you and do a raid for 15h and get your divinity :)
---
not really, your name is literally "Professor Hateraid", your opinion is of little consequence to me, the fact you compared Foghting Lion, Orewing's Maul, and Militia's Birthright to the underbarrel Grenade Launcher from cOd, THAT however is just disappointing, they *literally* couldn't be more different.
---
Some people have the explanation in their FACE and don't notice
---
As a missile main, this hits right at home
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter if you do have forsaken. It‚Äôs a 2% chance to appear in ONE of the 30 chests that spawn at the end of the raid. Tons of people haven‚Äôt gotten it since it‚Äôs release.
---
Huh, someone changed the settings to be accurate moon gravity. I suspect Toland.
---
The bright/cool colours are almost always in the wrong place
---
after 1 month u want to start raiding with your mediocore gear and without best DPS exotic weapon, you are in the wrong here, thats why in my clan i set a rule, play 2-3 months then u can sign for a raid. Really i don't want to carry people that are not willing to spend time on getting the most optimized gear for raiding, it's like you spit on my face and ask me to carry you =) 
---
also there is plenty of sherpa LFG's out there that will take on new people and teach them raid. But if you want to raid with expierienced 5 people this is called boosting and for that you pay =)
---
Oh no he downvoted me
---
i think you still get at 2100 until you cross from fabled III into mythic I, not sure what point that is though, should be around the 3k mark +- a couple hundred iirc
---
yes, only thing that could be slightly improved on it is a velocity masterwork.  Rule #11 is no loot posts, but the mods here don't do shit anyways so I think you're safe.
---
**‚ô´ It's nooot the best choice...
---
It's Spacer's Choice! ‚ô´**
---
What I was trying to say is a monkey (the guy in this vid for example) should get a free pass because they clearly have no clue what theyre doing, but people are like "lol all strikers dont know how to play"
---
A striker that knows what they're doing will get a meme made for them in this sub and it'll be framed on someones wall, you know like every day we get a new striker meme here?
---
Random noobs/players can be referred as blueberries.
---
till he slides and procs anteus wards
---
Lmao those loser biches lmao ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
It doesn't have to be a single season. I reset twice in one season and once in the next and got the title.
---
Bitch please, those ogres are free points. Bring a weapon to stagger them and any basic bitch special ammo sniper can three shot em.
---
That Ogre must really be unstoppable
---
when its return day:
---
IM SO PROUD OF YOU GUARDIAN, AND I WANT YOU T-TO H-HAVE THIS...
---
I feel like if you are going to come back a week after a post of a person just trying to help and the original post was deleted, AND you are coming back just to aggressively prove you we right on a post that no longer exists is a real special thing. 
---
I suggest to aid in proving your point you please submit a 5 paragraph essay proving exactly the points I was wrong on or even better a full research paper submission with screen shots and graphs and other evidence. 
---
At least then it would show you put some effort into making this subreddit a little more pointlessly toxic. But I guess, hey, what do I know? I was may have misread a deleted post 2 weeks ago.
---
To get the catalist or complete it?
---
what do u mean lone wolf?
---
its being so hard for me tbh
---
Agreed. Im an average pvper, got it in a few hours of play. Just use all the crutches you have
---
Yeah, it's almost fun when you forget you aren't actually punching things.
---
?
---
I solo'd this quest on my titan, for the Shrieker room I threw a suppression nade to shut them up and then walked in and dunked. Took me longer to get past that than it did to kill the boss at the end...
---
Doomfangs and monte carlo..
---
you forgot spamming your jump to fly at mach 2
---
Right can‚Äôt forget the exotic
---
You just proved the point. You are what‚Äôs wrong with the community.
---
Trueeee I love doing this to people but I hate having it done to me
---
i had to do the thorn strike twice because i did it with a friend but didn‚Äôt have the quest yet.
---
It broke me.
---
yeah same. I rarely play titan to begin with, but middle tree sun borker is some of the most fun I've ever had in destiny
---
I play top tree void Titan during PVE and Middle tree strikers for PVP
---
i don‚Äòt think so
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm in danger.‚Äù
---
Ahh so my power level doesn‚Äôt matter? It‚Äôs just the individual weapons/armour? Thanks!
---
you forgot one
---
Equip Sweet Business and Actium, hold aim and fire buttons.
---
It's also really noticeable with Orpheus Rig. You can get another shadowshot in literally 3-4 seconds after your first one.
---
But we are NEW, they should give it to us. Why should we do the quest? You already did it, we dont stop being so greedy
---
That‚Äôs like the best part. Just trying to get my god roll hammerhead. Looks like I only get two shots per week.
---
Even better if you have the ornaments for them
---
What's the song name? I have been hearing it everywhere.
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox add me ianblankg cuz I still need to get mine
---
Ok.
---
I did some testing, the masks did not increase my hit box.
---
Well, I don't.
---
But I have a weapon that‚Äôs 950 (bray tech Halloween gun) and everything else is 930. How come my engrams are still around 930
---
Thanks for the explanations! I guess I just have to pray that Xur sells it next week.
---
Great, enjoy 30fps on your pos potato.
---
I like your armor I'm just trying to save you from inevitable bankruptcy on the day you just really need to buy that one exotic you know what I mean.
---
acknowledged and thx for the tip. 
---
i guess you do have a point.
---
no, i'm talking about spectral in general. getting hatemail because i know how to ise it lol
---
He was a really good enemy, had so much more potential though imo. We should have played most of the campaign without Light tbh
---
Aim for the head and get a feel for the way the maps play. That's basically it. Destiny has a pretty big spread between optimal time to kill and maximum time to kill with its guns, so you need to aim for the head.
---
Quiet hunter kid in class is gonna get the I Made This for You medal.
---
Named appropriately
---
You showing me that its not a full circle Is just hurting my insides
---
I usually have more, but it's a shared account of sorts lol
---
But thanks :)
---
Didn‚Äôt think to infuse, now I did so, and have higher damage haha
---
Yeah, but if people wanna run ashes to assets they won‚Äôt have a great super to use, plus top tree grenades to explody crowd control when charged.
---
Np
---
Yeah I see what you're saying, I have a couple other ones I'm waiting on because I know itll be a bit more expensive and I have to take a trip to the shop I want to go back too
---
Gotcha, I figured I'd ask so I didn't give shitty advice.  I have noticed a wild swing in my ability to survive in destiny depending on the mode.  I do better in events like iron banner where there are less hardcore players.  
---
One good piece of advice is stick with the weapon you are most comfortable with, instead of chasing other people's recommendations.  I cant shoot scout rifles very well but some people love them.  My preferred loadout is typically gnawing hunger due to its reload speed
---
Nah I was a hunter. I don't have a titan yet. Thanks tho.
---
lmaoo
---
 **"I've seen this raw strength only once before. It didn't scare me enough then. It does now."**
---
What about those immune ogres from the new dungeon. Seems like they should be the new hive gods now.
---
Nice!
---
What is that?
---
Recluse is pretty annoying to get when you‚Äôre bad at pvp like me, plus I feel dirty whenever I use  it lmao.
---
I can feel the heartbreak that followed this mans play through
---
Gorefield...
---
Bullets won't work, John.
---
I haven‚Äôt played for a while
---
Those are the lost prophecy tablets
---
Pretty much they get you some cool weapons and once you've completed them all you get satires ghost shell
---
Are you stupid or 5 years old?
---
I hope they have. If they haven‚Äôt I still don‚Äôt think I can bring myself to watch the movie lol
---
Top 10% comp PvP titan here, currently 1600 ELO and 60%+ win rate this season. I skullfort shoulder charge people all day long.  It's definitely viable at all levels, but you really can't be braindead about it higher up.  You have to navigate maps differently and play around your team's engagements. You hear enemy gunshots, you engage on the poor soul who's radar is down while he's scoping. You also need to use your double charge of nades to force enemies to either fight you in said nade and die, or die when you buttrush them trying to reposition out of the nade. I feel like the hardest part of mastering it is learning the exact distance, and how to shoulder charge from the air.  I actually hate striker super more than any other titan super, but Skullfort as actually still active during super unlike OEM. Erase a dude, you get healed.
---
Sagiras ghost shell*
---
Yea you can finish the Izanagi quest in 4 days minimum now. You do have to get lucky with the rare bounty though!
---
https://youtu.be/-zvrkQ2w2mo I got a similar triple here to clutch a countdown round after my team threw.
---
Ao there is no Colonel chicken emote that looks like the right one on the picture, nice moderation keep up thhis good work. Also if i remove the ‚Äòwords‚Äô it also good to go. Nice one too.
---
Also the Colonel isn‚Äôt destiny related, Cayde is spinning in his grave. :(
---
Hush with the season of opulence skin
---
So which one represents the past, present, and future?
---
Anybody got the raw GIF?
---
Also Redrix if you have a 340 pulse
---
No, I really like it
---
So, we'll go no more a roving  
---
 ¬†So late into the night,  
---
Though the heart be still as loving,  
---
 ¬†¬†And the moon be still as bright.  
---
For the sword outwears its sheath,  
---
 ¬†¬†And the soul wears out the breast,  
---
And the heart must pause to breathe,  
---
 ¬†¬†And love itself have rest.  
---
Though the night was made for loving,  
---
¬†¬†¬†And the day returns too soon,  
---
Yet we'll go no more a roving  
---
¬†¬†¬†By the light of the moon.
---
Past looks new present looks like granite and future is all broken
---
I think the problem of people putting YouTuber/steamer opinions on a pedestal is a huge problem for the game in general, but one focal point being Gambit concerning this. When, for example, datto says in multiple videos that he won't even touch Gambit because of how bad it is, that's gonna affect the way his audience sees the game mode
---
It‚Äôs a random drop
---
Can confirm
---
From any game mode? Do I need to be using the gun?
---
The catalyst is locked away. It was available during a faction rally event back in y1 or 2 don‚Äôt remember. But isn‚Äôt available to get now.
---
Field prep is amazing. Bigger reserve ammo and maxed reload speed when crouched is the best you can hope for on a weapon you use for DPS
---
It‚Äôs respective to the order of the images. Past, present, future.
---
That definitely was me the first time I was taught this raid, lol.  I had a feeling it was coming to.
---
They have roughly the same color schemes as the Precursor, present day, and Descendant Vex, respectively.  So the bright white one is the past, the crumbly, darker one is the future, and the gold one is the present.
---
No one was paying attention to curse of Osiris, even Bungie.
---
The Last Run-on Sentence
---
lol as an owner of a gaming PC and an XB1X, wtf are you talking about? Destiny 2 runs at 30 fucking FPS and the best a game runs is 60fps...please don't try to lie and say the gap between PC and console is any closer...thank god for crossplay in Rocket League, even 60 fps feels awful now
---
1. Finding exotic catalysts is completely random and very unlikely the only thing to effect it is some catalysts can only be gotten in strikes and some only in crucible
---
2. Some raids have matchmaking but it's not that simple. If you look at a raid icon and see the orange thing next to it that's guided games. Guided games are pretty much a special clan based matchmaking for people who need just a few more people to help raid
---
But it takes hours to get matched and your better off finding a team yourself
---
i hate titans for running around the map shoulder bashing everyone
---
YYYEEEESSSSSS
---
Sounds like I have alot more grinding to do. Thanks for the information!
---
Everyone has a different opinion, I see where you're coming from but still don't understand how having 4 more people is harder than having 6 more people, especially if they were of equal and greater competence.
---
Ok. Great . something I can do when I reach like 1000000
---
A perfect:
---
Warlock with Nova: ‚ÄúOh, your approaching me? Instead of running away your coming straight toward me?‚Äù
---
Titan striker with fist of havoc: ‚ÄúI cant beat the shit out of you without getting closer‚Äù
---
Warlock: ‚ÄúOH HO! Then come as close as you like‚Äù
---
*insert JoJo comic but Warlock and Titan walking toward each other instead of Dio and Jotaro*
---
**YOU FOOL! I'VE BEEN SAVING THIS ONE JUST FOR YOU!**
---
The fact that Oryx was like 350 light, versus some random Dreg now at like 750
---
Thanks!
---
Hover over the slot for the catalyst and it'll say where to find it.
---
No you don't need to have it on you to pick it up.
---
Yes that's it.
---
That's how I felt when I smashed them with my middle tree solar titan. These one-eyed monkeys can taste my hammer anytime
---
Fatebringer was Arc - have you gotten a curated Nation of Beasts yet?
---
Thanks for not considering a speculation because you know everything but ok buddy you know everything
---
Same problem, but i have 3 keys
---
Keep hating lmao
---
I didn't even realize it yet, thx
---
I got 5 in the first 6 weeks of the lw raid. I know it was arc but this has the same role and is basically the same
---
Laughed only because it was a Stag they picked up.  √óD
---
armor and weapon mods are now unlocks instead of consumables half the exotics were reworked jade rabbit was majorly buffed a new raid and dungeon were released the moon is now a destination Eris morn is back and is the moon vendor there is a season pass now and a seasonal artifact that boosts your power and gives you seasonal mods which the main ones are anti barrier,unstopable and disruptior rounds which are used to stun and weaken the corresponding champions a new night fall the ordeal was released with different difficulties giving higher rewards you can upgrade armor to put on more mods and armor perks aren‚Äôt a thing anymore and armor has 3 more stats disciplin for grenade recharge intilect for super recharge and strength for mele recharge that isn‚Äôt every thing but it covers most of the main points you can watch a Video on it to find out more
---
Yeah I have that same feeling as well. There‚Äôs a month left in the season and very little secrets have been dropped so far. Bungie seems to leave the secret stuff towards the ends of seasons it seems based off of past seasons.
---
looks rad, but is this warlock wearing hunter armor or do the pieces just look similar
---
Honestly, deep down I hope we get the Vex Mythoclast back.
---
I happen to have made a meme about this. Check it out it's in my profile
---
Hunter: eat my blades
---
Titan: no u
---
H: no us
---
T: *big anime eyes*
---
both: *die*
---
Does it need the minor spec to one shot ads? I like it for pvp but pve is feels soft like a two tape. 
---
I have rapid hit and kill clip with a range masterwork.
---
Like the guy below I run a Devour build around getting my nades back fast. I also use an smg with demolitionist to help this even more.
---
Consuming your grenade for devour and having a melee to proc devour should be up pretty much all the time.
---
Using this method I literally sat in the middle of a vex invasion soloed it and every vex shot at me and couldn't kill me because every kill refilled my health in devour.
---
I don't believe that's correct. I've done 10+ resets every season since season 4 (including this one) and never gotten anything special for it.
---
Very true
---
According to destinytracker and most qp matches I am above average. Still struggling hard around 4k, went up to 4.5 once only to start an epic losing streak. Getting demolished by players who outskill me every 2nd game. 
---
True skill match making is a myth.
---
I got one last week with a Rapid Hit - Dragonfly and while super tasty, it‚Äôs kinda lacklustre. Three crits to down one red bar acolyte is not ideal.
---
I see thank you
---
Ima just superman around that bitch
---
I literally do not care. It's Sonic. It's not important compared to anything else going on in my life. Lol.
---
Another Arbalest-tier weapon, I'm sure.
---
TBH it's not a good weapon. Autos are just not in a great place. It doesn't compete with SMGs, hand cannons with good roles, or pulses. However, it's a good light boost and it's *usable* if you don't have anything better.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3tRyKbAVDQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3tRyKbAVDQ)
---
The main problem with doomsday is that it‚Äôs a 120 rpm. This means that‚Äôs it‚Äôs going to be doing less damage than a 150  every shot even though it fires slower. Try farming for a love and death, which is probably your best option now that iron banner is gone.
---
Getting those extra points just means you hit the maximum possible glory rank
---
It's kind of like a second rank within legend
---
Because it‚Äôs older
---
Like it pulls from reserves to keep it on target longer
---
Not sure as I just got this built on my Warlock. I do know that by the time my devour usually runs out because there is nothing left to kill my grenade has been back for a while so I can start the killing loop again as needed.
---
Chad Crimils is y1 version don‚Äôt @ me
---
Let Step-Daddy Shaxx's praise ring through all your dreams tonight. Hopefully, those dreams are of **THROWING MORE GRENADES!!!!**
---
Well, it can mean new player, but in match made activities it can also mean a random player that you don't have communication with or they are just doing their own thing.
---
I'm not a new player by any means, but if I'm going for specific triumphs (like unlocking the Undying seal), completing a catalyst, or trying to complete a specific pursuit, people would wonder what I'm doing or assume I have no clue what I'm doing and say I'm doing blueberry things. Which intentionally, I am.
---
HADOOKEN! 
---
..Am I doing it right?
---
I think you haven't met with 980 unstoppable Ogre yet
---
That guy is a nightmare!!!
---
Level doesnt matter in crucible. I beat people all the time with blue or green weapons for fun, without any exotics on. You need to get a kill with it to get the overshield or damage buff, so I dont see that much of an issue. And if you include wallhacks into the equation, we need to include flawless execution as well. The exotic was made for crucible, so it should be good in crucible. Everyone hates it because everyone hates it, it's a bandwagon thing and everyone is predisposed to hating it already. My opinion is that it's not really that bad, but I know most people have a different opinion, and that's fine with me
---
Oh, i understand now.  Just thought of something kinda cool, itd be really cool if we could prestiege if we hit that max rank. Kinda like in COD when you hit max rank aswell.
---
I‚Äôm thinking specifically strike and not a raid so there‚Äôs quite a bit of leeway. Strikes aren‚Äôt exactly the hardest thing to do. Was doing the strikes part of ace of spades and only had 1 other guy in there and he was brand new. Got 60% of the quest done in one strike because I only killed the easy stuff and let him go crazy on elites and bosses. Plus it would be a way to dip your toes into other classes and learn the mechanics.
---
8 mobility?
---
If it‚Äôs really not that important to you then why are you talking about it.
---
Considering I can literally kill Nokris with three punches, maybe even two with the right setup, yes punching is a viable strategy.

1. When you get down to like 5 seconds, pause to go punch one weaker add and refresh the timer so you don‚Äôt have to start from scratch with combination blow.
---
Jolly cooperation
---
It's really all about preference and how you play. You don't need exotics to do good damage. One-Two punch shotguns still work really well without Liar's Handshake.
---
Good standard loadout is a good close to medium range adds clearer (usually SMGs, that's why Recluse is so sought after), and either a close or long range orange bar killer/yellow bar damage gun (so sniper or shotgun), and heavy can be either DPS weapon (like 150 RPM spike grenade launcher, preferably with full court), or an adds clearer like 21% Delirium/Edgewise if you have Izanagi's Burden as your boss killer equipped.
---
To summarize, an adds clearer, bigger enemy melter that can also be used for boss, and boss killer is a good weapon loadout to carry at all times.
---
Raiden Flux, Nighthawk, or Orpheus Rigs are really the only exotic armors I use depending on what subclass I have equipped (usually Nighthawk since I only like supers as DPS machines, and that's the quickest DPS for a hunter).
---
But being flexible and learning to use multiple weapons and armors and how they work best is key to having good builds.
---
Nah ive been playing with a friend and theyve also had it. Maybe its just destiny netcode or low tickrate that im not used to but it makes the game feel super unsatisfying to play
---
My wife got it in momentum control, without using the consumable (she did pick one up), and she wasn't aimed down sights. I think there's a few different ways.
---
Also the hard drive is a 5400 rpm drive from 2010 or something
---
Really just not good
---
I already got it finished. I'm now trying to get all of the exotic handcannons from Forsaken. Shadowkeep is next!
---
What if the vex have already defeated us in the future? And now we are just carrying out the rest of our own timeline? Like think of it like this, the vex are essentially doctor strange from infinity war. They know the outcome of all possible timelines, so they let us defeat them over and over, thus creating an invariant pattern. We as guardians think we weave our own fate, but we don't, we are merely pawns in the cosmic war between the light (traveler) and the darkness. If not for the traveler we'd still be face down in a ditch in Russia, not battling Gods endlessly for the salvation of a race that was already dead. We think we are inevitable like Thanos did, we think we are the immortal conquerors that can't be defeated, and that will be our ultimate downfall by the vex. This is why it seems the vex are so inferior to us, slow moving, weak uncoordinated machines, but truly they are the most powerful race known to us.
---
Thoughts?
---
Yeah, i stated it in the post before people may of acted impetuous. 
---
Even exotics for me seem to underperform (not fully aware if perks are the same for everyone on that rarity)
---
You can actually get those by turning in any of the challenge bounties it's a low drop rate but they almost always come fully masterworked
---
Hunters and max mobility feeling nice
---
Forsakes was better
---
*doesn‚Äôt have leviathans breath equipped*
---
Untill you stop laughing because you remember how horribly slow and weak arcstrider is. Lol I can say that because I'm a hunter main.  And my main pve build is top tree arcstrider. But whenever I bring it in pvp I'm just like God arcstrider sucks. Striker titans supers are so fast. Warlocks are fast.  Spectral blade hunters are fast.  And meanwhile arcstrider can't catch a guardian walking away.
---
I see what you did there.....
---
Hive! Bring a sword.
---
died from architects more than falling off the map
---
Who knew the Ace of Spades was actually a modern military side arm
---
The thing is i farmed the iron banner and hit 2000 points Which made me legend but was still not checked in
---
So you dropped 3 out of 4 chests? Nice! That is RNG at its finest.

Well if you still want to get mountaintop, there are cheese lobbies that will allow you to complete the skills step in one sitting, just saying.

Void trees in general are like that. They buff and debuff a lot. Void Titan trees for example: Top tree heals allies and gives them an overshield on melee ability kills and Ward of Dawn defense/offense. Middle tree, each ability hit adds a debuff that heals allies. Bottom tree adds suppression shoulder charge. 
---
Now suppression grenades are really strong against supers but the damage is lackluster. Arc bolt, for example, wins out on being an offensive grenade by far.
---
Mhm.
---
I think it was 3 out of 5 or 6 because of keys from the wishing wall, but still, yeah, it's crazy RNG. I really wish I could gift them to the people that actually did the work during the raids.
---
Did you not put in the Petra's run wish? Weird that you didn't get sent straight to orbit if it really was a flawless run
---
I'm so trying this later. Just got these at a 950 drop last night
---
You‚Äôre starting to sound like the darkness NGL...
---
It wasn't a genuine flawless run, we were teaching one of our New Light friends who just bought the DLC, and I saw a good opportunity for joke.
---
downvoted  for incorrectly using boomer
---
People got it in crucible, Gambit, haunted forest..... There's literally like 100 different posts on this now. Seems like pure rng
---
I use fast grenade build with Devour because by the time you lose Devour from killing all the enemies you will always have a new grenade charge to start another. Essentially unlimited Devours which means you are very hard to kill as long as their are enemies around to kill.
---
You can for sure have multiple keys at the same time, assuming they are different keys. I had 3 of the 4 saved up until last week's update.
---
Best guess would be the OP's friend was doing a forge he already had gotten the key for.
---
I just got it doing a menagerie.
---
you get the first 3 campaigns
---
I just feel like its overpowered. Think about it, if you only use your super a maximum of 2 times a game but on average just once a game, and that can get so quickly shut down by an ability that can take 25 seconds to recharge is rediculous. If there was a way to counter the suppression grenade I could see it, but you can't when you're in your super
---
His dad works at Bungee
---
Yes, agreed, the penalty is far too strong
---
Ok so for soloing stuff (or basically for everything) this might just be the best Build for Warlocks at this Point:
---
\- Bottom Tree Voidwalker with Nezarec¬¥s Sin (must be Void Polarity) + Vortex Grenade + Burst Glide + Healing Rift
---
\- Double Breach Refractor (chest) + Opressive Darkness and Enhanced Ashes to Assets (Bond) + Sniper/Grenade Launcher Finder (Helmet) + Sniper/Grenade Launcher Scavenger (Boots)
---
\- Armor with the highest Disciplin Stats possible + Disciplin mods to take it to at least 90 (after u maxed out Disciplin try to go for Intellect next)
---
\- Primary Weapon Loadout:
---
Izanagi (with Catalyst) + Recluse (Shield Piercing Rounds) and/or Every Waking Moment with Demolitionist (Shield Piercing Rounds) + 150 Spike Launcher with Auto Loading Holster with Boss Spec and/or Venido GL3 with Boss Spec
---
\- Secondary Weapon Loadout:
---
Mountaintop (Major Spec/Boss Spec) +  Recluse (Shield Piercing Rounds) and/or Every Waking Moment with Demolitionist (Shield Piercing Rounds) + Anarchy
---
\- If there are unstopable Champions in the Strike u also need a Energy Handcannon with unstopable Rounds to switch to on the fly
---
\- If there is a lot of shielding going on that u can¬¥t handle bring Hammerhead/Delirum/Edgewise to switch it in on the Fly on Addclear
---
I guess that sums up the Build quite nicely. U will start with consuming your grenade to proc Devour and then just keep shredding through adds like there is no tomorrow while u are getting your grenade back every 3-4 kills. Keep Spamming your nades to debuff and get kills as nade kills charge your super like crazy.
---
If u have any more Questions just ask.
---
i opened 25 more swarms and got 0 spike nades
---
It‚Äôs $60 for Shadowkeep and the full year of DLC until next September/October.
---
Still blows my mind people still argue for super damage reduction for Golden Gun. Scariest super in the game already.
---
I just reread the PP lore page. You're right. Future us definitely gave it to a current(ish) Saint-14. Maybe it has something to do with the forest itself. If it can manipulate time, then both Saint-14 and future us should enter at some point and meet. I think the Saint-14 we see dead in the forest has had the PP for a long time. Which would mean future us still has to make the weapon and give it to him in the past. It doesn't make sense that would would have to make the weapon if we already got it from Saint-14.
---
It's like the book from Dark, if you ever saw that show. It never has a point of origin. It just always existed, stuck in a time loop.
---
I just got one doing the nightfall ordeal, I believe it was right after looking at a harpy when it's tentacles were extended

I thought he was holding a hissy fit hunter without zooming in
---
It wouldnt be "bungie" if they didnt fuck up something haha.
---
too soon :c
---
I don't have MB but I do have MT so I might go grind it.
---
The game isn't going to be balanced around 6v6. That's just something you'll need to accept. Quickplay is fun but it's a sideshow. PvP in general is a sideshow in this game unfortunately, but when they do balance, it's usually for Competitive.
---
Kek
---
Yes one of the most shittiest snipers of all time. And an exotic one at that
---
Pictures or it didn‚Äôt happen.
---
Using submachine guns? Mine only count medals with a sub
---
I don't care? I don't play Crucible as much as you. I just wanted the armor, so I don't need your 'tips'.
---
top of leaderboard != medals
---
I used a legendary scout called the Telemachus-C and it did wonders.
---
they are the god of anti-happiness
---
Sure!  I just have a thing for the pirate aesthetic in general... and thought it would look neat to have a space pirate ornament in the game.  But I won‚Äôt say no to a western cowboy themed one either haha

I got mine while [loading into the haunted forest.](https://imgur.com/a/QNBvJMW) I had done 2 runs before this but I hadn't even landed yet this time. XD

you could google it...

wait wut

Thats coz their armor is ugly ngl

Also a smart option.

Can confirm, it was a bug!

A lot of people are still barely there

Ur gonna need a mic to be able to raid, period. Communication is the most important factor, no matter how much DPS you do, if you can't get to a DPS phase you are fucked.
---
Ah okay thanks, this is what I was trying to figure out

Nice one dude!!

I call them poppers sometimes because of the satisfying sound
---
No problem. I was in the same boat trying to search online and nothing popped up and kept looking around the tower like crazy and it just popped up. Let me know if you get it with my method so we can keep sharing and help other guardians out!
---
Which is just lame, I dont get to play very often since I work a lot, and I dont have very many friends that still play destiny, so competitive is essentially a no go because solo queuing is trash and ppl on l4g sites are toxic so like you said, the pvp is a sideshow and it sucks because in a game like destiny, half of the reason you want good rolls on your guns is to effectively use it in pvp, pve is not challenging enough that you need certain rolls or you can never get ahead
---
Just to be sure it‚Äôs working, right when the game starts quickly grab 5 motes and bank. You get a medal for being the first to send a blocker. See if it counts.
---
Top tree tether, had a few games where like 3 enemies would just walk into it while in super then just blunder around all confused

You'll get it one day!

I already made a post about this there

I did it wrong homie.
---
It‚Äôs not even close to half the game. 
---
If you decide to classify the game into two modes, sure it might *seem* that way. But if you look at the amount of content involved it‚Äôs not close. If you look at the basics of what the game is about PVP is basically irrelevant. 
---
PVP is, thematically and, for most guardians functionally, a diversion from the real game, not an equal part of it.
---
What did you get?
---
Lizard of a thousand voices

Next week
---
I think if they work as intended (regardless of the weapon/armor) they should never be nerfed.  If it makes a specific class over powerful, come out with a counterbalance, but do not nerf.  
---
Now if it isn't working as intended (Telesto giving super energy when sparkles are hit with grenades) it should be fixed to work as intended.
---
The ends don't justify the means.

DLC no....season pass yes.
---
All of Osiris and war mind are absent from this list. There are a lot of others not included like faction drops.
---
You won‚Äôt be able to get all exotics and guns without forsaken and shadowkeep. There are 4 raids you‚Äôre missing out on without forsaken and shadowkeep. You already have all the destinations without either so don‚Äôt worry about that. The two dungeons and seasonal content are locked behind pay walls but I mean they have to make some money.
---
Personally I'll go with C as a power move
---
Anyone wonder why the vex get ‚Äúworse‚Äù over time? The precursor vex are all gold, the present vex look normal, and the descendant vex are are black and ‚Äúlower quality.‚Äù What happens?
---
i love aztecross, he‚Äôs not afraid to say shit exactly how it is. crucible is in a horrible state right now, piss poor matchmaking aside, there‚Äôs really no incentives to bring people back. i‚Äôve played more than enough this season, got a few resets, but other than that, really no point to play solo anymore.
---
Double up on breach refractor mods and put anti-barrier on Recluse.
---
Lord Shaxx using a hunter subclass lmao
---
A guy in one of my games last night got a 5k with a single nade
---
His early super and subsequent orbs won us the round
---
Wasn‚Äôt that great... the forsaken energy bow
---
I once saw obiwoncanblowme on ps4 while playing overwatch and I never got to tell him what a badass he was...
---
U don't need the dlcs but yes they open up a lot more content, u have the destinations but a lot if not all of the activities for the moon etc. Will be locked. U also miss out on a few exotic quests. They're fun but not necessary
---
Yeah we have the road map, the road map for the season says we fight the final assault on the 19th of November.
---
Moon's haunted
---
Max stats are grindable no matter the content you own.
---
Yeah they can definitely do better. There are so many routes they can go with Hunter, Warlock and Titan design sets. Personally I'd like a Witch Doctor look for the locks, long military trench coat would be pretty cool too.
---
Yeah this weekend he had the Cerberus for like a short amount of time before they changed it to fucking riskrunner
---
Probably. Idk my Warframe lore that well
---
Not bad
---
Ok boomer
---
You won‚Äôt get any of the new raids, which is end game content that in my opinion is what makes the game fun and grind able. Raids are what i love about the game and it‚Äôs too bad a lot of players are missing out on some of the best ones. I think every raid with forsaken/annual pass and garden are better than the year 1 raids.
---
PVP is in a rough spot for several reasons (Aztecross is making some awesome videos on the topic) and the increase in cheaters isn‚Äôt helping at all. Now that it‚Äôs free to play, cheaters are popping up everywhere and it‚Äôs plaguing the game, basically making it unplayable. Artifact mods are making certain builds broken and we‚Äôll have to wait until season of the dawn for anything to change.
---
In my opinion, i don‚Äôt think shadowkeep is worth the money, and $10 for season of the undying is kinda lame too. You should get shadowkeep for the raid and dungeon that‚Äôs pretty much it. If your friends play then you should too, find a clan who you‚Äôll get along with and have a fun time
---
D1 has much more hive then D2 but seen has D2 is mostly f2p D1 would be a good start as it has more content
---
Ah
---
Ahamkara bone shoe LOL
---
And about shadowkeep, take your time before buying the dlc. Watch videos to see if it‚Äôs really something you want to play and get it if you really feel it‚Äôs worth it. It‚Äôs just a continuation of the story of our guardian‚Äôs adventures.
---
Do you mean like what primary kinetic weapon to use with it? I've been using the BrayTech Warewolf with it and that seems to be pretty decent. As far as what Heavy to use, I'll leave that up to you guys. I tend to use unethical weapons so my opinion will just get me downvotes.
---
There is a questline or quest you have to finish to meet the criteria before you can access the forge. Don't think you need DLC.  Just might need to kill certain mobs to kick it off. Search and look for guides from 2019. For precision kills go to levithian raid or any such spots. I have a quest that sends me back to starting area and plenty mobs to kill there... This is at end of quest. Camt say have had much luck with drops.. Better off farming mats for XUR NPC amd buying legendaries from there.
---
Look for where Petra is located.  
---
Weakest = The Strand
---
Mid- Divalian Mist
---
High- Rhesilvia
---
I‚Äôm not your buddy friend
---
yeah, post your vomit u/logankemp8
---
[Laughs in 6 deathbringer shots]
---
Isn‚Äôt it crazy how it looks almost as if the future and past are in the wrong place. It like it looks so advanced and futuristic in the past, but in the future it‚Äôs destroyed and torn and I just feel like that‚Äôs very deep Yo
---
I know this is just a joke meme, but Mountaintop, all things considered, is totally adequate now. It‚Äôs not an auto reload monster and that‚Äôs prefect for it. Fun to use, still decently usable, but not wildly OP.
---
Easiest way to tell, is there taken essence dripping up from the ground and are taken the majority enemy in the dreaming city.
---
All guns from Y1 are fixed rolls before Destiny returned to the random roll days of D1.  So there won't be any "God rolls" for them.
---
Nah man zoomin with dunemarchers is way funnier
---
Maybe if ikora wasn‚Äôt building a god damn vex gate right in the tower we can avoid it
---
If you love the PVP in this game more power to you but for me PVP is something they make me play to get gear that feels like a chore.
---
I remember searching that I had to activate the triumph to get the materials for one of the quests, could that be it?
---
\*Hits enemy titan in the head with Golden Gun\* Me: "Noggin!"
---
Holy crap is that from Psychonauts?!?
---
[Laughs in Blocking DB Shots with Cataclysm]
---
Run toward the Titan, blink past the Titan, turn around, overshoot your Nova, missing the target, then run away. That will assert your dominance. Next time that Titan sees you, they'll run away.
---
I have no clue I‚Äôve tried everything that I could think of and nothing seems to be working
---
 You mean as in when drifter sets them on fire pop or some other pop?
---
Yes, I too love having abilities that require an exotic piece of armour, a mod that will disappear at the end of the season, and a specific subclass, to be remotely dangerous.  
---
I fucking cry when I get bounties that require me to get ability kills in crucible because my super is the only thing that can kill anything.
---
I was expecting a one-bullet double down or something crazy.
---
The issue is that mtn top and recluse have been meta for over 6 months by this point. It‚Äôs the same issue with one eyed mask, bungie isn‚Äôt making changes fast enough. I have both guns (i got mtn top before the nerf to the quest) and I‚Äôd be fine with the changes. Same with the Luna‚Äôs howl changes that happened, lots of people were upset but honestly it worked out fine. Fighting mtn top and recluse is rough and the playstyle itself is toxic since all you have to do is play hunter and act as an ac-130. That‚Äôs why we all want nerfs, the game is balanced overall and it‚Äôs *easier* to get both guns so it won‚Äôt be a huge deal since you aren‚Äôt ‚Äúwasting‚Äù as much time. I say that cuz comp isn‚Äôt easy for everyone and i recognize that
---
I've seen AnaBraysBoyToy in the FoTL Forest once
---
Basically: Sentients created by Orokins, turned on them, things happened, kids, and frames against Sentients, Orokins ded
---
I was just talking about the sound when you kill them
---
Repost
---
It should be just playing the requisite gametype and/or getting the requisite kills.  I think the RNG just sucks in general.  I have almost exclusively played PvP, gotten to 952-ish light pre-artifact boost, and have yet to get the catalyst for my vigilance wing.  I've done hundreds of crucible matches, if not more, with that weapon in my inventory, and nothing has dropped.  One of my buddies got it during a match we played together though.
---
ohhh I thought this was just a glitch but that actually seems really useful
---
That‚Äôs true, because one users have no skill
---
Bro, this is Tetris, how you not know? Smh.
---
yessss all of it
---
Forsaken
---
I found it only works on specific characters
---
It‚Äôs called ‚Äòkipping‚Äô
---
Comes from spider bounties
---
Use thundercrash
---
all im trying to figure out is if im doing this the right way. to some extent i have been breaking it up with other stuff. ill grind some them take a few days and come back and do it again. i started right after shadow keep launched and here we are a month or so later and i still dont have it. im close to giving up on this.
---
You missunderstand me...I dont want it buffed, its already nerfed and they gonna nerf it again...but that will make titan most weakest pvp character .. since he dont have reposition/dodge skill and his 'Barricadel' cast animation is very slow.And they also nerf bottom tree for the braindead roaming lightning super.So at that point , i dont see anything the titan have that is unbalanced ( after they nerf OEM again).
---
really? all i know is i literally just did it. maybe they had another weapon with a spider themed name?
---
_AYAYAYAYAYAAAAAA_*
---
Quick question. Is there a penalty for leaving non competitive crucible? Sometimes I will be getting absolutely destroyed when going for a triumph and just one to leave and do something else, but I am afraid of leaving even in case there is a penalty of something. I would never leave a comp game so don't worry.
---
okok
---
I think it‚Äôs just a random thing that happens, I played my first time this week and got it my first try
---
I tried that but it didn‚Äôt work. :/
---
Gotta go fast
---
This was the 3rd time this happened in a flawless attempt. Is it just me or is someone else experiencing this ‚ÄûMagic‚Äú?
---
Yeah I killed an acolyte
---
Coincidence?
---
instead of a loadout why not use all of them depending on the situation
---
*teleports behind you* 
---
Nothing person el kid
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt know, I killed an acolyte in haunted forest and got it :// I don‚Äôt know how to get it know
---
i was in a fireteam with my buddy doing momentum control and randomly got this triumph today. apparently, my friend got it while aiming down their sights and saw a spider; i didn't see it myself, so it seems to extend to fireteam members.
---
Upvote for dying of laughter
---
I disagree, you don't need to eat nades in sub master content, melee is enough, and eating nades is worth it for regen in master and above content. I usually find I don't use nades often enough.
---
Yeah only knights that shoot those blue explodey projectiles are referred to as boomer knights, of just boomers. Its still a good meme though !
---
Oh shit, I gotta look into that
---
That's not even including our ability to slide up staircases
---
There's a way to mess up the bridge? Lol
---
Yeah dude, have a look on YT. Guy mid run with the werewolf and it just pops on screen just as they're about to, or have just, kill the last couple dregs in an area.
---
First post on reddit and downvoted like crazy because others also made posts about this as well? I created this account today to make this post to try to help others out and got an unwelcome response so thanks for that. Visiting the Spider NPC is a 100% reliable way to go get this if you don't want to get it doing other various activities.
---
You mean the absolute metric fuckton of blues that take up all the space in my inventory AND my postmaster, which have made many good legendaries, powerful gear and a couple of my exotic drops just go down the drain?
---
I'd trade that catalyst for suros catalyst.
---
it sure does! thanks! :) didn't know what crucible and gambit were till i looked it up haha
---
Or when you have the perfect shot lined up and the enemy literally just fuckin dips out the game
---
Trinity ghoul? Shit is hype.
---
‚ÄòNew light who dis‚Äô is funny!
---
ooo thanks for the suggestion!
---
I don't understand?
---
It's because it is random.
---
*Casul
---
They're called blowy dudes
---
So we were all just freaking out for nothing? What even is the triumph.
---
You are complaining about oem being nerfed. To actually believe that Titan is useless except for oem you must have the same number of brain cells as a hazelnut.
---
Now make your armour blue, you crazy hedgehog.
---
its the perfect week! all three EP drops, LoS nightfall, solar singe, yeah boi!
---
That's weird, so you guys both got it there and then?
---
okay, thanks! yeah, my friends are telling me to grind for bright dust.
---
Apparently, anytime im not using a tether, and end up getting sniped, i always fail. Its like they dont realize they need to stand in the circle to advance the bridge
---
Vex Offensive if you have it and keep buying bounties. Gave me a surprising amount of xp while I was going for the triumphs. I hit rank 100 seasonal that way
---
It's right to Eris' left, your right of her when you spawn in in the south of the map
---
You got yeeted.
---
ü§Æ
---
guess sleeper is in the energy slot, gg
---
Ok woomer
---
For sure, I'm actually somewhat new myself!
---
So you can put mods on your armor, and some of the mods just give you flat stats. The stats are
---
Strength (reduced cooldown on melee ability)
---
Intelligence (reduced cooldown on super)
---
Discipline (reduced cooldown on grenade)
---
Recovery (amount of time it takes for your hp to start regening naturally)
---
Resilience (max hp)
---
Mobility (exactly what it sounds like)
---
when I say "run max disc mods" I mean put a mod that gives you extra Discipline (reduced grenade CD) on each armor slot that you can.
---
Demolitionist is a perk that you can randomly get on certain weapons that makes it so whenever you get a kill with the weapon that has the perk, your grenade cooldown is reduced. 
---
To correct my previous comment, you can't get Recluse with demolitionist. However, there is a void sub machine gun that you can get from the Moon called "EVERY WAKING MOMENT" that is void and also can roll demonstrationist, so that would be good for this build too
---
"Excellent point-missing, Guardians!! Now get back to the crucible and use grenades!"
---
Go to Eva in the tower, buy the new consumable, and use it while in the Haunted Forest.
---
4 whole runs of vex offensive including the boss without dying.
---
Where you and your friend the same light level? If for example he was pulling an old bow from his vault that was 750 or something but his average light was still much higher than yours we would still do more damage with his bow. Damage with your weapons is based on your average light level, not the weapons light level.
---
I have the Gambit SMG. Forget it's name. Not sure if I love or hate it. Threat detector is amazing with enhanced SMG loader, but the range is dispicable.
---
Lawl
---
Okay Soomer
---
Reaching to 2100 is quite a grind, reaching to 5500 is like pretty fucking hard and time consuming knowing your getting 20 points a game last time I checked. Ok I can agree that pinnacles are easy to get but they are extremely time consuming. Unlike exotics, everything is luck based, you get those when you just normally play the game, you can‚Äôt aim for exotics because it a drop.
---
Cool name...but too late...5 years too late
---
ur welcome, i often see xbox players there tool
---
Thats great
---
If ur on Xbox add me ianblankg I still need to get em. What‚Äôs the benefit on the armor? Like perks in gambit?
---
As a Chronicler I‚Äôm gonna need to know where you got these books so I can purchase them
---
Your best shot at that perk with a decently good farm source would be the moon shotgun which you just need to get the essence and farm the weapon.
---
How did you not realize that those dudes are called "cursed thrall" or "thrall exploder" you must be a dweeb
---
i got to fabled in 1 and a half hour and to legend in 4 hours. its a joke and peolle playing comp this season are trash. i did not even lose a single game cause the people were that bad, it was matchmaking taking time.
---
Randy's eye socket destroyer
---
I was going to mention that one. Clean Getaway or something like that. I love it, but on Console it's just lackluster due to all the recoil... The Threat Detector and Surrounded is excellent in PvE, though!
---
should i just discard most of my armor and weapons then? cause they are all 750
---
Aye now get that mida catalyst
---
Glad you found someone non-toxic! Just a tip, when looking on an LFG site, look for terms like "adults only" "be chill" "don't rage". Those groups usually tend to be good at the game (IMO) and end up being the most fun. They also usually won't tolerate yelling cussing others out. Whenever I make a post, I straight up tell people if they start being toxic I'll kick them. Tends to weed out the assholes for the most part.
---
Honestly, exit strategy is my favorite smg right now. It‚Äôs def the best legendary kinetic option and very easy to get full damage with one melee kill. I try to avoid using recluse at all costs anymore.
---
Yeah I wanna be able to use the perks. And sorry I'm on PSN... :(
---
You can use teleport gun in UT to teleport into your enemy
---
Ok let‚Äôs clear this shit up, who the fuck wants a gun that they grind for and the reason they are trying to get the gun is because it different. Lmao this is a joke
---
These posts where people have little to no glimmer make me feel like I'm playing the game wrong. I damn near always have max glimmer. Makes me wonder what I'm missing that I should be using glimmer for.
---
That cost you‚Äôre seeing on screen is the cost to purchase it from collections if you already acquired the exotic. It tells you how to get that exotic for the first time right there as ‚Äúsource‚Äù.
---
Lord Salmon will be back next month
---
That entirely depends on how it's coded. Destiny uses a hybrid p2p+server model, which likely means there are some values that are authoritative to the client.
---
Gotta keep in mind that it's not just things like shards, etc that you can edit with CheatEngine; you can edit literally anything, if you can find it and understand how the data is stored. You can change ammo counts, damage events, player and AI position data.
---
For example, you could imagine a design where kill/death is validated by the server, but ability energy is on a simple client-side timer. Change the energy value on your local client, use an ability you're not supposed to have charged yet, and the damage goes through.
---
yes it is, it is a big joke, but do you want to know something? some of the pinnacles are good, like recluse. its shit easy to get, but its like one of the best guns. they are not supposed to be good, different. why is it that hard for you to grasp that consept? only cause your bad at the game and has to spend a long time getting them does not mean its like that for everybody. also im going to sleep so im not gonna respond.
---
https://youtu.be/27N3GxgP27I
---
Yes. Using the consumable seems to be the key. It was only just offered starting today.
---
Devourbomb is crayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyp.
---
I got to 3300 points within 2 hours
---
Especially with the artifact in the game giving players who sink more time an even bigger advantage
---
