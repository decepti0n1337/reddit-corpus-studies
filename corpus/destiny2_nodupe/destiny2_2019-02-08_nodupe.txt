More like sorry to drifter. He's disappointed

Just shut up and take my money.

This is super common.

Of you were paired in content with a warlock, would you rather them be attunement of grace with phoenix protocol or attunement of control with geomags?
---
Nvidia Shadow Play is always recording. It's just whether you hit save or not.
---
Xur didn't have Luna's last week.
---
&gt; Idk Im an extremely mid tier crucible player and no one has hit me with it.
---

---
Then you haven't yet played against it. It's incredibly easy to get kills with. It beats out supers because you can pop from a corner, release it, and pop back into cover. 
---
You're incorrect. I've seen loads of the shots. Dozens of them.
---
Is that why hunters are still the far crucible majority and titans are the minority on console?
---
AND PUT THAT TELESTO AWAAAY
---
Let me re-iterate - you're judging the balance on a mode DESIGNED AROUND SPAMMING SUPERS. This isn't neutral play. 
---
Nice Parcel of Stardust. Is it a god roll?
---
Wow so double teaming somebody and failing or running away and hiding won‚Äôt work for you anymore? Shame
---
Okay, then you've been lucky, or you're lying. There's no way you've been shot at, and dodged 30+ shots. Also, thanks for downvoting, hilarious that you think internet karma points mean jack shit. 
---
Considering it does nothing unless you try to hide in a corner or somebody already died to them it‚Äôs pretty easy to counter, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt shotgun them then evade backwards and hide in a corner anymore plz nerf‚Äù

I used that helmet and threw Nova bomb into a group of taken and literally got my super back immediately. My friend is pissed at me. I keep getting the stuff he wants. I got contraverse hold with enhanced impact induction. That really set him off üòÇ

I hate you, but congratulations! :)

BAKEURETSU FOR ALL!

Absolute unit?
---
No they are talking about destroying an opposing tether itself (the core of the tether) to destroy it, not tethered enemies.
---
Looks like a Symmetra turret
---
Top for PvP, bottom for PvE. I should have specified.
---
That wizard came from the Moon
---
Wow. This is uh... a dead meme... to say the least
---
I'm no expert. But fallout disagrees with you. If you haven't seen his stuff on shotguns it's worth a watch. If you have, and disagree, I still maintain that none of this make much difference, skill trumps all these stats.
---
It depends on the content really. Geomags are very good in a lot of cases such as Gambit but Protocol is also very good, as well is always going to be probably the best PvE super.
---
I made the mistake of watching a video of someone doing it solo and thought I could pull it off lol. No not that good unfortunately 
---
Dude I felt so bad, I was playing with my friend at the time who is also a titan and wanted it
---
Yikes, haven't made the 3rd phase yet lol 
---
I got that the first week of playing and have been struggling for the ship/sparrow
---
Third one is hive... Probably, I'm not sure now
---
I knew it was tough. I kind of wanted to see how far I could get solo. Wasn't very far lol

Nah nah nah servitor themed webcam

Holy fuck that was hilarious! I cannot stop laughing! Take my upvote! Take another from my second account! Hell, take a silver, why not? Scratch that, a gold! Scratch that, a platinum even! God, just come to my house and plunge your 2-incher into my gaping asshole already! You can have my wallet afterwards too! Take the credit cards too, I‚Äôll even give you the PIN numbers! Hell, you can take the whole damn house while you‚Äôre at it! You can even have my wife and kids if you want! I‚Äôm willing to go into poverty just because your post on reddit.com was that funny! I think there‚Äôs only one thing that would have made your post even funnier, though:
---
If it wasn‚Äôt a goddamn repost
---
Public events are doable at any level, though they are meant for multiple players. If you see other players around, I think you should do them because the give a good amount of xp. Each public event has [a secret objective that turns it into a Heroic public event](https://www.polygon.com/destiny-2-guide-walkthrough/2017/9/7/16263480/heroic-public-events-find-trigger-earth-titan-nessus-io) for even more xp. The loot isn't amazing, though. You get maybe one item.

Exactly. Worst pve super ever, I swear

Hey guys! Thanks again!
---
I had a great time with a great squad. But soon came to the realization that I need forsaken and that Pass for 80% of the content. And I can't afford that right now due to health problems.
---
Anyways, thank you so much guys it really helped me! ‚ò∫Ô∏è Keep on playing and have fun!
---
God please stop. I‚Äôm tired of these people flexing on us with their god rng when we‚Äôre stuck with these damn exotic trash ships. smh my head. delete yourself please.

Were you secretly recording me?!

Past two days have been real patchy for me. Multiple disconnects every session. My end appears to be running just fine though. Must be one of those weeks I guess. 
---
TAKE MY MONEY!!!
---
Yea, personally I don't have one. I just use a regular echo and it does the same stuff. 
---
It is ALWAYS watching
---
battery powered bluetooth, ill pay 60 for it. get on it bungo
---
Cool. Have a nice day 
---
I liked the Forsaken story but I skipped all the CS.  I can't believe I went through it again on my Titan.  I agree on having the option to just skip the main story line on your alt, assuming that there are no differences in story based on your class.
---
Hooch is crazy.
---
Maybe...that would be cool man.  
---
Titans getting chicken nuggets 
---
That's cool. I got mine from a ascendant challenge bounty. But I also have gotten exotic from red bar guys. 
---
A flash to a simpler time
---
they had it on amazon for ten dollars at christmas time 
---
I'm so sorry. Have a nice day. 
---
wow! 
---
Holy shit i never knew i needed that
---
Not to me it isn't.
---
I have never cackled more loudly in my life. 
---
I tried Jotunn in crucible and I can assure you that it most certainly does need a direct hit. I've shot it in front of someone's feet many times and still got punched in the face. And the burn damage is basically a tickle.
---
With the nerfs to Blade Barrage, is Shards of Galanor still the best Hunter exotic? Or is there a new build?
---
Oh can everyone just fuck off with these 'not 100%' posts have you never seen one before on this subreddit? The answer is always 'it rounds up' just use some common sense and get one or two more kills to see if it completes
---
Yeah, running with my clan, just after completing Breakneck quest &amp; this...whew. Next is Crucible for Last Word. 
---
The magic number.
---
Pre-defined. Currently only wild/natural drops are randomized.  It's as if the exotics in our collections are locked in year one status.  Personally, I'm only missing the 1kV, I think.  My RNG luck in that raid has been atrocious at best.
---
THIS IS AMAZING!
---
That is epic
---
We sure are
---
Npnp haha
---
I would buy that just as a desktop model. Awesome..
---
I like HC. I see HC I upvote. What is the Shader btw?
---
The shader is Calus's Treasured.
---
Black Forest cake
---
Tnx, so a raid Shader? Sry to ask. 77 days in game, I can only shoot things, much to learn lol
---
Ironically I couldn't finish the third draw until I started using ads.
---
Alright, though are the other perks good?
---
btw...if you are interested in your Gambit stats: [https://warmind.io/gambit](https://warmind.io/gambit)
---
Especially for Gambit, especially if you have Hallowfire Heart - Melting Point vs. Envoys and then Primeval wins matchtes. 
---
Yup. Its from the prestige Leviathan if I recall correctly.
---
I am a fan of thundercrash, that mini fist of havoc melee ability is a blast.

Oh the good days with the VOG sparrow on SRL, that was fun to blow up right in one's face

I did it in 3 days HAHAHA get on my level pussy üòéüòéüòéüòé also i got a big pp u cant win

What if OP says to do it harder?
---
Have the Same problem... Couldnt find anything about it as Well.... 
---
Obviously 77,777
---
Damn, well played. That was some slick shit with the dodge.
---
So frustrating. I was so excited when I got the last piece of armor I needed only to be crushed a few minutes later
---
This happens if they're unable to punch something for extended periods.
---
Love the helmet
---
Was that all of them? THAT WAS ALL OF THEM!

Please please leave a link if it gets produced üòçüòç

thanks! I usually post more picturesque stuff on r/HudlessDestiny

The exotic turned out to be Mk.44 Standasides.
---
Alright smart ass, not everyone gets to invest alot of time daily
---
You can't complete the triumph even though the badge is complete 
---
Thank you :)
---
Now on to Breakneck!
---
Im Torn between warlock and titan tbh, i love playing my titan, i know its only a small detail but i hate all 3 of the titan jumps
---
My first two gambit matches gave me both thundiebabe and queenbreaker-chan. I felt like filth using one of them - QB-chan never left my power slot for gambit and pvp since
---
I've completed the badge but it says I haven't completed it
---
But... This is the original artist's Reddit account posting it...
---
I got 7 primes and 2 eteched rn 
---
Mine's full of blues and shaders.
---
:(
---
Ah yeah I just noticed the 0/10 badges at the top. Very strange. Have you tried the Bungie Forums? 
---
It is? I take the curated drop in all the time and it works fine, actually seems to give a bigger precision hit box if anything
---
I think one of the main reasons we don't have permanent gamemodes as we did in Destiny 1 is due to the low population in Destiny 2 Crucible, Giving the player too many choices would lead to excessively long queue times whereas keeping 1 rotating gamemode means that there will be a semi-healthy population of players on that gamemode.
---
Used it in crucible. Nothing wrong with it for me.
---
"Cuz there ain't no wolves on it. Not even a single tree." -Lord Saladin
---
when should I start to get a haul like that?? I domt fully understand the post master mechanic 
---
It has in-air accuracy, moving target and came with hip-fire grip mod where mw is stability
---
GIMME!!! 
---
Whenever you stop picking up engrams on the field
---
Yeah seem great, the bow I got has Fibreglass, tactical bowstring, archers tempo and Rampage
---
It's the range, AoS has more range and is a lot more forgiving because of that. Range in D2 translates to accuracy and bullet magnetism, which AoS just has more of. Try to be closer to your target and the gun will be a lot more consistent. 
---
Thanks 
---
OP's engram inventory is full. That's why there's so many in the postmaster.
---
And the mechanic here is simple; any engrams left on the ground when you leave a planet/area automatically go to the postmaster.
---
About 420k pve and 32k pvp
---
Oh yes
---
Thank you, this makes a lot more sense. I've always been paranoid about missing engrams so this helps haha
---
i heard the alexa controls are trash
---
I said the samething after I got mine I'm not a pvp player at all
---
I'm searching but looks like that drivers version is really old, I mean, we are moving to September 10. Won't be dangerous to install that old drivers?
---
Nice
---
Who cares, it's just an emblem.
---
Go back to Drifter and see if he has it
---
The second voice is the best man, idk what you're talking about
---
Which rocket launcher is that?
---
Congratulations on finishing the tutorial! 
---
Why everyone love it ?
---
It has a higher drop rate than 1k voices
---
THX!
---
Great point. I mostly run with Scathelocke in Pve and Pvp and I completely understand what you‚Äôre saying.
---
Curated rolls are fixed afaik, it's a set combination of perks.
---
Will it teleport to me in the next room? 
---
Grats and I dig the stormtrooper look!
---
Dropped for me yesterday, scout dexterity, primary finder and smg scavenger. I gritted my teeth so hard I think I chipped a tooth. Then RNJesus gave me jotun and curated ringing nail in one forge.
---
The midnight coup is weird in PvP. Since it's a 150 RPM rampage isn't going to help your TTK. What are you looking for exactly? A hand cannon for PVP?
---
Nop, i just wanted to know why is it so apreciate, because i dropped it Yesterday ^^
---
until we see you posting complaints about how OP they are cause they keep killing you.
---
they can't be OP unbeatable and not hold a candle to your flame at the same time.
---
I've heard it's not an automatic drop, it may still take some games now that you're there... 
---
What are the odds lol
---
Before I read the title I thought I was a ghost shell. Having these would be so cool. 
---
It's great for PVE. It's a keeper. It's currently the only 150 hand cannon in the game that has Outlaw and Rampage. Great for PvE. Probably the best kinetic hand cannon you can get.
---
Use Ace
---
Had my second one drop this week, honestly droprates seem really good when completing powerful frames. I've had more monarques+jotunns drop than I've had curated rolls
---
Ghost shell ruins it
---
Where can I get this?
---
I'm almost done and used misfit as well. The zen moment perk helped a lot! I picked up an Ether Doctor on the way also with Zen Moment and Rampage. Curious to try this one
---
It's all about planning. You know the current meta as well as anyone in Gambit so plan accordingly. If the enemy team is getting close to the 25 or 50 mote mark then get rid of all your motes. It doesnt matter how close to 10 or 15 you are it's useless to keep them if the invasion happens. Once you've banked and they invade pull out a similar weapon like a bad omens or colony of your own and run. Get away from your teammates the more spread out you are the better chances you have of surviving. If you aren't lucky and you die then don't leave the spawn area so fast. They only have a few more seconds and it doesnt hurt to wait them out to avoid a second respawn timer. This seems simple but it's the most solid advice I can give you. It's how I play and it's how I win in both solo and squad queuing. You will not win every match but Gambit is a fun and enjoyable experience that takes a little tacticle thinking.
---
[This is what I‚Äôm seeing](https://imgur.com/gallery/JMjM1m8) 
---
I don't think so.
---
It's on rotation like Iron Banner and Mayhem. So it's not like it's going away permanently. Just sucks that you have to wait for it to come back.
---
You lucky sob
---
I'd say blade barrage, good for huge amounts of burst damage.
---
Dont believe the people who say it is shit now, I think its even better, and it seems to charge faster especially if you have Shards of Galanor.
---
That's a nice advice. I am just not too sure how rare do these good perks come by but I guess the vault will have enough space until I am confident enough to judge it myself.
---
i actually really like that idea a lot, people who like the way it is now get to keep it, people who find it tedious get some content they can play through in order to make it less tedious.
---
I stopped playing gambit since I got my title 
---
so,that waa you that shot me down. I hate you both.... ha ha ha . seriously
---
Right*, I have big fingers
---
Ah gotcha. Thanks
---
I know what you've done, your witchcraft fools nobody 
---
I'm always so oblivious when it comes to Titan skating posts since it's not possible on console lol
---
Itll happen once d2 gets their stuff together and puts it in the game
---
Almost as easy as using queenbreaker... Almost.
---
I should try that
---
Blade Barrage
---
I want to punch you... heeeeee... it's all i know. but hey... I'll just punch anything else. ha ha ha 
---
Nice I just got mine on Monday while finishing Prestige Leviathan, now I know what to use it for!
---
Sandbox team working hard, cant figure out how to add a 40 ms cool-down on the titan jump. 
---
Solstice of heroes 
---
Depends on what you're trying to do, and what you like. SB is more of a PvP super (with Gvisin Vest), while BB is useful for shutting down roaming supers in PvP and ad clear, but can be useful to quickly burn a Primevil or a boss. The Arcstrider super is very similar to regular Arcstrider, with the extra ability to deflect projectiles.
---
I can't really tell you witch one is better, but Arcstider super feels a little underwhelming for me. Both BB and SB got nerfed, and I don't think one of them is better than the other by a huge margain.
---
Life Pro Tip: Don't pick Nova Warp on the Warlock.
---
Wow what skill.
---
Thx for pointing that out
---
I got D2 for free then a friend got me Standard Forsaken. I was mostly talking about tlw and it's cool quests.
---
Cryptarch*
---
Unfortunately, it'll cost ALOT of legendary shards. The pool of items is too large.
---
Back when it first released in year 1, it was a reward from the Dead Orbit faction, during faction rally. 
---
Since there's no faction rallies Post-forsaken, I don't think there'll be any other ways of getting it. Not that it matters, theres alot of better year 2 hand cannons out there.
---
The luck of these blueberries, am I right?
---
My heart...
---
happened to me, except I got Queenbreaker
---
Nice! Plans to make more?
---
Loads really fast on my One X after I dropped an SSD in.  It‚Äôll be up to a minute sometimes before others load into strikes, etc and I‚Äôm just standing there like an idiot.

Or is it the traveler?
---
Real Guardians use the broken Last City Pistol.
---
You see the issue is I'm a Hunter and I forget that they explode
---
There is no Trials anymore, as of right now it‚Äôs still on hiatus and there‚Äôs no word on its return. 
---
I barely touch PvP anymore. It‚Äôs just not for me really. If you plan on playing on PC, I‚Äôve seen many comments about how different it feels and gameplay ‚Äúisn‚Äôt the same‚Äù as console. Titan skating apparently has been a huge part of the current meta but that‚Äôs about to shift, it‚Äôs getting nerfed finally. Uh, other than that I can‚Äôt think of much haha. Hopefully someone who mains PvP will chime in and give a better answer. 
---
That was proper gunslinger. Well done. 
---
Trials doesn't exist at the moment. PvP is filled with Jotunn and shoulder charge Titans BUT they can both be countered &amp; it's fun from time to time.
---
Forsaken itself is half decent. Last Wish is a decent Raid and SotP is as well, apparently. 
---
I agree i don't think it affects anyone else but yourself. The rate drops are all the same on the systems. It sucks you have to do double grinds and all. You should just have one login for all 3 systems that let you use that account. So i don't understand why people are getting triggered by this. I do however understand paying for the game for the different consoles. But still the grind and all you inventory should be accessible. 
---
-Who knows bungie might surprise us with leaving e.a 
---
Ugh I want to cry. No trials. I‚Äôve been gone so long I don‚Äôt even know why it was taken out. I‚Äôll do some digging on this sub and see why. 
---
Thank for your input, I appreciate it 
---
It fill a range slot, but playing outside your range will net poor results. 
---
Ah shucks, there goes my ice and blood speed runs...
---
But how?
---
Until March 
---
Sup with his leg?
---
That what D 1 was. Are Hunters still the weakest class in D2?
---
Yep part of the recent update 
---
If there was better matchmaking I wouldn't have to bail. As I said, I finished the task quite easily when I was placed in matches of the appropriate skill level. Why should I give up the progress just to be farmed for kills by better players? There are multiple ways the quest could be better designed to allow for some cushion for players that are not good at pvp. SBMM, checkpoints, etc. Simply having proper SBMM would make the item accessible to more players, reduce complaints and the arguments between the pvp/pve crowd and the "git gud" remarks. It's a win/win for everyone but the elitists. 
---
Absolutely! [heres an article](https://gamerant.com/destiny-2-faction-rally-trials-hiatus-season-4/) that might shed some light on it. 
---
Its fun with luna and well you just shoot a continuous beam its kinda funny.
---
It‚Äôs good with arsenic bite b4 bc u can pull out all the close range headshot
---
I've completely run out of ambition to grind all the exotic weapon steps. I don't know why every single one has to drag you through 30 hours of pvp or gambit.
---
I got one of those ghosts becaause it was on sale for $10 on amazon. It‚Äôs cool but you still have to run everything through Alexa with the ghost skill. So you say ‚ÄúAlexa, ask ghost about my clan status.‚Äù And then it responds. Problem is, if your WiFi cuts out at all (which mine does about once a day and has to be reset) you have to go through the whole setup process again. It would be awesome if it could just replace the echo and work as an Alexa, just with ghost‚Äôs voice and name
---
I was surprised it wasn't to Skyrim cut.
---
Why? Link isn‚Äôt loading for me

Admitted live on stream he ddosing people in comp
---
Innocent till he actually does something, you know how many people would never be able to play games again because they say they can do shit? 
---
He said he had people that can boot someone offline
---
I agree matchmaking is crap. The quest step definitely could be handled differently. At some point you either play the game or you don‚Äôt. I‚Äôve never understood the attitude of playing/watching something you don‚Äôt like and complaining about it, especially when it seems like this is a back seat issue for bungie.
---
Thats the very last titan exotic that I need and it will NOT drop for me... so damn you!
---
Congrats man. Broke my headset at the Motes part was at 98% went to 67% when the invaders were using queens braker

yes, its definitely sniper rifles', hammerhead's and last word's fault.

Well, I can't criticize you for not providing proof/sources, because I can't either.

Yes, now I‚Äôll get OEM dropped after this nerf is applied
---
You cannot get year 2 items from the engram. 
---
I ragequi.... ragecried a lot. 
---
Large blast radius means that if there are 2 enemies grouped up, they split the damage. Small blast radius give you a better chance at concentrating all damage on one target.
---
Plus the perks on my OF are rangefinder, rampage, and I can choose between spike grenades or proximity grenades. It's like a Swiss army knife.
---
Ladies and gents, the douchebro approaches.
---
Oh 
---
Maybe it‚Äôs different on console, sounds like you‚Äôre on PC. Even last week when the quest was fresh and the crucible was flooded simultaneously with sweaty and noob players, and people abandoning matches the second they got killed (seriously have never seen so many people leaving and half-empty teams on both sides), it was okay if you were patient and played smart.
---
Part of it is just adapting to what you see people doing. If you see lots of a single tactic, then change your loadout or playstyle to counter. For example, if you‚Äôre having a problem with campers, then maybe you need to force them to come to you. Play the objective and defend your space but don‚Äôt chase down your enemies. 
---
Don‚Äôt focus so much on getting kills, rather, focus on playing with your team, getting assists, and not dying. Don‚Äôt be too aggressive.
---
Damn that really sucks because that's my last titan exotic I need
---
That might've been me. Last night?
---
What even worst when you're holding, the screen turns red, and an ogre drops as you're rushing to deposit. That also might've been me last night. ü§™

No Forsaken exotics from xur

He's like a newspaper, no one buys them
---
I want another militias with proximity grenades.
---
Rest in peace bro
---
The only sound that comes out of it is.... "errrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr......"
---
How so? You are being a baby bitch and try to receive empathy to compensate for your lack of skill. No one cares man, deal with it.
---
I'm on console and GOD DAMN I CAN RELATE to the ire of people quitting matches. I always stay til the end.
---
I know half of it is intelligent play, maybe a third. But this (plus gambit) are definitely filled with people who colour your view of the whole thing.
---
Maybe that's what happened here? Maybe I need a decent clan? There is definitely an element to the community that make this game just... just a chore to get through.
---
Titan Juggernauts can melee them when their super is active.  Also Titan Juggernauts can "super" through the electro beams in the pyramidion.
---
But what if you're working on a daily where you have to send blockers and get extra for larger ones? Sometimes you get rewarded for bad behavior.
---
üòû gives some luck. I am unlucky as heck. But gives rng. 
---
Im not missing the point. You were saying that another game had better pvp because it had level caps. Also quickplay is part of crucible so i dont know what you mean by "Quickplay, there is no cap". There is level and weapon caps in all of crucible. Yes going against a full team is challenging. The best way to accomplish this quest step is to stick with your teammates. If you haven't played it much at all of course its gonna be challenging when you start. You will improve. But you wont get better by complaining and blaming the game. Just give it time and practice.
---
anyone can test this.  Go fire at a wall sometime hipfiring... look at how close the grouping is.  Then aim down the sights.  It's amazing how much the gun climbs as you shoot it while aiming down the sights.
---
I've been plinking away with a Better Devils
---
Same thing, but heart of inmost light lol.
---
Well considering I talks out killing myself more often then actually doing it I'd assume the same logic carries over :)
---
Nah. You entering into a dick waving contest, half hard and with nothing constructive.
---
This was a comment, not an invitation. You are exactly the reason I have always avoided shooters. Destiny collared me with sci-fi lore, excellent mechanics and a wonderful  community. Unfortunately, c*nts like you came along too.
---
Thanks to u/impliedshrimpz for posting infographs for us. It's because of him that I even know about these.

The lore on that exotic is amazing.

I stand corrected:

Nightfall Par Scores Update
---
In Destiny Update 1.1.3, we introduced Nightfall emblem variants. As the new Legendary Nightfall Challenge Card will give players more ways to increase their scores, we‚Äôre increasing the par scores required to earn specific rewards. Emblem variants, auras, and token reward bonus par scores have been updated to the following:
---
30k
---
60k
---
110k
---
200k
---
As a reminder, when you reach new record par scores for a specific Nightfall, you increase your chances to earn the associated Nightfall Unique Reward! We‚Äôll be watching community scores closely once Update 1.2.0 is released, and we‚Äôll let you know if any adjustments need to be made.
---
All that shoulder charging works up an appetite you know
---
Wait, does this mean it'll be more in line with D1 skating (for non-macro skaters)?
---
If so, I could not be more happy.  Macro skating is BS, and is super demoralizing from the receiving end, and I hate that I can't really skate manually.
---
Right there with you.  Excited to start dishing out some long-overdue justice on the macro users.
---
McCree is that you?
---
Quickplay has no level caps, bud. I was also saying that another game had fairer PvP because it took into account things like progression, weapon levels and strengths. Lots of algorithms that are easy to action and I think would make things fairer. That's all.
---
So yes. You were missing the point. No harm, though.
---
You certainly have attained the high ground 
---
I hate you so much
---
It's high noon brother

Bastards were a pain in the ass but that raid was great

In that case get ready for season 6 gambit!

Don‚Äôt worry I have zero other forsaken exotics
---
You okay bro? Hit my inbox if you wanna talk
---
Cancer item. Should be nerfed already, and it's just so ugly too. 
---
lmao i glad youre having issues with crucible....its a PVP weapon. took me 4 hours to finish the whole quest and im not even that good in crucible lol. if you cant even finish the crucible step and are complaining....you dont deserve it lol
---
Titans always have to look stoic and unbroken. Unburdened by the problems humanity faces while their entire existence is nothing but war. Punching things is their only outlet to their emotions. That's why you see Titans cry if they cannot punch things for extended periods.
---
I can stand the between load times activity to activity.  What is beyod anoying is the inventory load screen. 
---
IF i need to change guns or get something from inventory (fire team medallion or crucible medallion etc) it take a good 20 seconds on XB1.
---
The crucible one is really really bad since you cant use it like other items (red cube for the masterwork cores or the armor item for forges) and queue them up, you HAVE to use it once the match starts, which means you have to find some point in a round to stand there and do it which means you die.  
---
Aim down sights
---
I mean, geomags'll do the same damage, it'll just take a few seconds.
---
Probably was, you moochu?
---
Cause if you are I‚Äôm sorry cause you‚Äôve got 10 infamy resets and dregen title and still lost 46 motes
---
Le Mon mitigates that mask as the poision keeps it in check.

Thorn should work way better for it.
---
Got mine from a crucible match where I dominated. 
---
You mean I wasn't supposed to base my Arc hunter entirely on a punch-then-dodge eternal loop? 
---
Yeaaaaah, no. I deserve it plenty, despite people like you. I want to play the final mission. I like the lore. It's apparently an excellent mission. I just wish the barrier to that was players like you. The toxic, unpleasant bullies that make me a solo player first and foremost.
---
But I need to send one of each blocker and get sidearm kills so fuck victory
---
Update: After ~50 runs over 4 days i finally got it masterworked
---
It‚Äôs unbreakable
---
No what I'm saying is that while yes you can be level 50 and go against a level 10, all damage and health is made equal. So it only comes down to experience and skill. Which is why I'm saying to practice. Yes the matchmaking isnt perfect but it's not as bad as you think it is 
---
Jumping over them to bait them into exploding is the only good strategy

I'm not sure if you read what you type. QP is a part of the Crucible. Crucible is the name given to PvP content. There are sections of the Crucible that differ from one another such as QP, Mayhem, Iron Banner, etc. but all of it falls under Crucible. That means your comment "Quickplay, there is no cap. Crucible, there is." is wrong. 
---
My question though is: What are you even talking about when you say level caps? Since everything is normalized in QP, how is there an advantage for level 50 players playing against level 20 players using the same gun? IB is obviously different but outside of that, where are the advantages to being higher level? Are you referring to which guns are available? If so, I can agree with that since higher level players will have acquired a wider range of guns but that doesn't guarantee more skill. I'm not saying "git gud" cause lord knows I'm just barely above "awful" but I don't think you have a grip on what is going on other than EVERYONE can agree that matchmaking sucks.

I have got sunbracers drop randomly 3 times, yep 3 times. Let alone getting them from xur.

Are you serious? I bet you were one of the Titans babies that cried when I was run all over you with my gwinsin vest. The mask is beyond broken and it's been the longest exotic to remain broken. Fuck the hunters had half the health Regen on wormhusk and people bitched. OEM  is insane 
---
Its all perspective i think. I average something like a 1.4 eff....thats terrible. I suck. I know it. Im progressing though. Im taking it as an opp to get better. Its feel great to be getting bettet. Stoked when i had like a 2 something eff. Kda whatever its called....find that loadout that fits you and work it. Idk, man. Im primarily pve/pvpve and jusy trying to help quell the rage.

&gt;Aww... Don't worry bro. Just couple of weeks. And u gonna have em. Try to run lots of raids. It has more chance for exotic drops.

I seem to get domed by persuader or fate crises soul
---
I recently started the malfeasance quest and every time I got 10+ an invader would always appear. Every time I kept saying I‚Äôm really risking it but I never died to an invader with motes üëç
---
that gun was fire
---
For the loss, it won‚Äôt fix. Ppl will leave and no one will backfill their spot. This is how it works in competitive, and trust me, it‚Äôs worse when your teammate leaves and you know no one else is coming, than it is to spawn into a losing game once in a while. 
---
Sounds like you need to relax. Can the quest be difficult if you‚Äôre paired against a full stack in crucible? Sure. I‚Äôm on console too and it was really not that bad as you‚Äôre making it out to be even when I solo queued. I think you should work on your gun skill because this entire post was just a pity fest. This meta has plenty of options in terms of guns, don‚Äôt just throw in the towel because the gun wasn‚Äôt handed to you.

You prob aren‚Äôt gonna wanna Hear this, but I took like 2 weeks off playing God of War and Final Fantasy 14. When I came back I got Shards, Queenbreaker, and One Eyed Mask all in a day. Over a month later I‚Äôm back to being dry searching for Geomags. I think the long rest is the key. Bout to do another one
---
Yeah, if you stand there and stare at it while it's on its way. I've seen it miss when I've fired (pvp and pve), and it's missed me plenty of times. I'm not saying it's not a great gun, but it's not as OP as haters make it seem.
---
You also literally can get them from the main story
---
It‚Äôs not cheating but it is a problem; the game is designed around spawn protection but 6 man teams are too much for the map size. It‚Äôs almost impossible for 4 man teams to dominate the map that way and spawn camp, which is how it was originally designed. It‚Äôs not so much a player issue as a design issue; the maps basically should be bigger, or spawning mechanics need to be adjusted.
---

I love to blow up last word bitches faces with my chaperone
---
I didn't say cheating.  I said exploiting.  Here, let me help you understand the difference.
---
[Exploit](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/exploit): to make use of meanly or unfairly for one's own advantage.
---
[Cheat](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cheat): to position oneself defensively near a particular area in anticipation of a play in that area.
---
Both work, but in this case it is more of an exploit rather than anticipation since it allows an unfair advantage.
---
So no, it was never how the game was intended to be played.  To say it is makes it obvious you are one of the ones capitalizing on this exploit and that makes you a shitty player.
---
I wouldn't waste my time reporting every childish player that plays the game like this.  But don't try and say it isn't exploiting and even, by definition, it is also cheating.  Follow the links, those definitions are straight from the dictionary.
---

Might want 5o contact grant in the phionex communities clan. He carried me through my first.
---
This I get, but it should still be possible for the new player to participate in a comeback rather than wait less than a minute for an unwinnable match to end.
---
Never mentioned Luna. Never mentioned skill. I'm doing just fine. If you'd read what I wrote, you'd know that I want to enjoy the last mission of this quest. Crucible is a fucking chore when the first step of the quest is luck.
---
You got lucky. Proud of you.

I think they should go back to the way they worked in D1 where you got an item for any of the three classes. I would buy things from Xur? on my highest light character to transfer to the others and bring them up. That‚Äôs how I got all 3 to 400. I still don‚Äôt have one character at max power in D2. 
---
My warlock is at 632 or so, hunter is at 620 something, and titan is at 600. I hate the way they handled leveling in D2 where you have to do milestones to get higher level gear but once that is done you are pretty much at a stand still until the next reset. At least in D1 you would get a piece of gear +/-5 light to your current level and could infuse them to another characters gear (warlock helmet to titan helmet, etc).
---
Alright that was my guess

It's a lot less on PC.

The reason I like his is so you can prioritize what you want. Like, this week I don't want to buy the Titan armor piece and I can make sure I don't get it from the fated engram by buying it from my Hunter/Warlock

The only stupid thing about invaders is that they can see through invis efect(personal opinion)
---
As an invader counter measures, i run around with a tracker module bad omens(cluster bomb, tracker module and velocity mw)
---
With 3 heavy ammo finder perks i get a brick on the first wave(most of the time)
---
When being invaded, ignore ads, look for invader, fire za missile. If it misses, reload dodge, fire again. Not failproof, but, hey, that‚Äôs my playstyle.
---
That‚Äôs true but Xur still doesn‚Äôt sell year 2 items and I have all year one items except acrius. Unless there is another Playstation exclusive I don‚Äôt know about on Xbox. I already got borealis a few weeks ago.

as a titan main i agree with this
---
Uhhh ok....
---
Anyways, it is seen in some forsaken trailers (people caught it on a Fallen container or something, unsure where it is ingame) and i actually have a ship with the SIVA symbol on it. It's called "The first domino".
---
And the flavor text is: *It was over before anyone even noticed*
---
I mean, it's literally "the light" vs. "the dark".
---
It's about as good vs. evil black and white as you can really get
---
I agree. I think there are times where running them around is good to waste their charge as much as possible, as long as you don't run into your own team and feed kills lol 
---
It also boost damage done and tracks the attacker. Kill the attacker and you get instahealed and shielded. A competent Titan can get it snowballing.
---
I recently hardwired my PS4 but I don‚Äôt know if it made a difference 
---
The most recent is the Forge Update.
---
Next one is season of the Drifter, which i think drops in march
---
These are not nearly as large as Forsaken. Forsaken revamped the entire game and it wouldn't be a stretch to say it doubled its content. These new DLCs are just smaller updates. Like 1 small raid, and a new activity with some new objectives and new extoics
---
How do you get from light vs dark, black vs white, to good vs evil?  That makes no sense.
---
Hanging with Devrim in the EAZ.
---
Currently, we have Forsaken as the major content drop. 
---
From there, there are currently 3 mini dlc that are included in the annual pass. Currently, Black Armoury is available with Joker‚Äôs Wild planned for a March release and Penumbra sometime in June. There are a couple roadmaps you can look up that show what each one will contain roughly. 
---
It‚Äôs unclear what will happen in September but Destiny has yet to go a September without either a major dlc releasing or a new game. We haven‚Äôt gotten any announcements as to what it will be yet though.

Good Vs. Evil is a very black and white proposition, as it "Light vs. Dark"

Keep one of each type

Also have saved the starter gear (pistol, smg, armor) in case they make them exotics like d1

I have all 4 of them this time and haven't had any exotic drop in 2 weeks:( only things I buy from xur was hopping I will get something nice

Holy shit

My recent load out that I've been enjoying a lot is Redrix's Broadsword, Tatara Gaze, and Thousand Voices.  I feel like it suits the longer ranged style of gambit and lets me do well as an invader.

Adding on to this. Instead of its removal can we get a titan figure skating mode. Judged by Hunters and Ew... Warlocks.

Thanks bro. Ily

as a warlock, i usually shutdown Spectral blades with Nova Bomb Cataclysm or the Voop Gun (Tractor Cannon). If you got a Super Mod Build, you'll get Nova Bomb in no time and ready for shutdowns.

With the buff Acrius is very good now. You‚Äôll want to get that (From Leviathan Raid)
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure there was a patch where engrams had a weighted chance of being an Exotic you rarely get ie, one you don‚Äôt have
---
Awesome. Thanks for the info!
---
Well we don‚Äôt know exactly what the nerf will entail; look at Blade Barrage. We all were calling it a nerf but really it was a rebalance and it‚Äôs still just as viable in PvP. An exotic getting nerfed isn‚Äôt going to destroy a whole class when they‚Äôre actually buffing a lot of the underpowered subclasses. This of course is all from a PvP perspective. 
---
And skating is not getting removed - arguably it will actually be more common now because it will be possible with normal input, making it a skill to learn. It‚Äôs just getting adjusted so that it‚Äôs design, not an exploit.
---
Basically I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any reason to assume the worst.
