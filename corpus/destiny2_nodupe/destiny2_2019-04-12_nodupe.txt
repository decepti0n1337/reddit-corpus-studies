No land beyond, a gun that used to be a joke but then became one of the most dominant guns in the crucible.
---
---
---
Ive got one of those, but its just not as fun as a misfit..
---
Arcstrider's combo finisher heavy attack can oneshot supers. Way of the Current can block/deflect most supers. There are some exceptions like you stated but it works against many of the commonly used ones like dawnblade, spectral and hammers.
---
Sometimes we wipe...
---
^Exactly this.
---

---
It's a novelty, having too much mayhem and the novelty would be lost. It's like iron banner, without all the fanfare. It gets people to enjoy more of the content and PvE players to at least dip into PvP. If it became permanent then it would lose its purpose as an attraction into PvP, and become super annoying to play just as u/Godcracker says.
---
Me too!  Anthem gave me the itch to play looter shooters again.  Now I‚Äôm addicted to destiny
---
Unfortunately they're kinda rare to get after a match, it's possible, but the odds are really low. You can get 1 guaranteed legendary a day per character from a daily bounty though so that should help a bit.
---
Militia's drops from the Lake of Shadows Nightfall, but that's fair on Mountaintop.
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs an absolute nightmare. At one point I got frustrated and tried to cheese him (I found a spot on the wall near the edge of the map you can hop on), but he refuses to change phases to that area if you‚Äôre up there. I don‚Äôt know how people managed to do it, because it was a pain. It was easier just doing it in a group for me. 
---
NFs and strikes aren‚Äôt that difficult once you start doing them and get everything down, they just tend to take a little longer since you‚Äôre down 2/3s of your DPS.
---
Welcome to bungo matchmaking! Last night on the climb up from 1k to 1.9k I faced multiple teams where half their scores were well under 1k.
---
Lol
---
Cool, thanks for the answer. How do you get it?
---
Of Hunter?
---
None of the above, its shite
---
Your dad can‚Äôt turn it off if you don‚Äôt have one ü§î
---
SYLOK THE DEFILED!!! Thirsts for your light.
---
Same. Was a bitch in a half
---
Clean your damn desk lol
---
Can't you not get dust rock or the other spider weapons from prime engrams, only from Wanted enemies or spider bounties
---
Even Bungie have said it‚Äôs too strong.You‚Äôre talking mince.
---
It used to be obnoxious because other supers couldn‚Äôt compete, but with ark week I don‚Äôt find it annoying
---
It‚Äôs a tv standüòÇ we were in the process of putting new carpet down and it‚Äôs not done yet and we had to move shit around and it got placed on my tv stand
---
ü§Ø
---
Great, now when he shows up the tower he will freak out from all the lookalikes.
---
Same.
---
Pretty sure my warlock blinked thru the blades in a game of mayhem I just played.
---
üòã hope that does well
---
Nah, you'll feel lucky every time you use it!
---
This low effort post tho
---
OEM isn't(wasn't) OP. Chill.
---
Ive fought against oem, I've used oem, ive beaten it with snipers, fusion rifles, and shotguns, oh and primarys. Stop making excuses and get better.
---
thanks!!!!
---
or zwipe
---
Wish I could actually win in a fight against other supers as golden gun and not always be killed or trade because they one shot me but I don‚Äôt one shot them
---
SHAXX===GOD
---
I'd worry about Ahamkara transcending the simulation and getting loose or some crap a bit too much to muck around with them.
---
PC
---
Dang d2 with those harsh life facts...
---
I rarely ever lost to a arc titan as an arc hunter. Even pre 3rd tree. The bottom tree's dmg reduction while dodging was so good if you knew how to work your way around the map.
---
Dope. I‚Äôm a big PlayStation fan boy so that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm always on. I do have an Xbox one too but PS4 is where it‚Äôs at
---
No it wouldn‚Äôt, it would lock people in so they can‚Äôt change it, that‚Äôs stupid
---
It should be available to everyone. Earlier, two people who didn't own Forsaken were asking about it. Plus, the first time it appeared, all players could do the quest.
---
Agreed
---
Over the course of nearly 500 hours, I've gotten 5~ish in-world exotic drops.
---
I only have a Warlock, so in 500 hours, I've gotten 56 of the 73 exotics available to me. (The 73 includes non-RNG exotics)
---
For every 10 exotics I buy from X√ªr, I get about 1 drop in-game. wtf.
---
For the past 22 weeks I've owned the game, every single week, I've bought my class exotic, the weapon, and the Fated Engram.
---
If X√ªr didn't exist, I'd be getting 1 exotic every 100 hours.
---
The RNG just ruins the game.
---
I genuinely enjoy Gambit, so I hope more other games will adapt it as a mode. Not as exact copy, but more of an own take/variation.
---
Hell yes, same here tho, I love ps4, I still have my ps2, and my ps3, well and my Nintendo‚Äôs, I love those to, lol
---
I finished it with skullfort and bottom tree striker, if you run titan you should try that
---
You aren‚Äôt getting anything but what came with forsaken, don‚Äôt quite understand what your saying but you won‚Äôt be able to do the black armory or reckoning without the pass
---
Have you *fully* completed the base game campaign? You're not actually done unless you talk to NPCs in the tower and accept quest rewards. You should be able to do this quest without owning any DLC.
---
&gt;If you want to level up fast 
---
sounds optional to me
---
üëå yeah, I never looked if it was for all players because I preordered forsaken and the annual pass. I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs Available for everyone so people can experience its glory
---
I still have my ps3 but it has a hard time starting up games as usual and I miss my ps2. :/ sold it way back then to buy an Xbox and then I sold the Xbox to get a ps3. I was making moves back then üòÇ
---
Fr? My ps3 still works like if it was new, mine is the slim one, not the super slim but the slim one, u know? And oh that sucks :( but Ayee PS3 tho lol üòÇ n yea sounds like it. U were hustling! üòÇ but yea, I still have my original shadow the hedgehog game for my ps2 lol
---
buddy can you turn into a human missile? no so it is scientifically proven that titans are better case closed no other argument
---
Leeeeerroooooooyyyyyy jjjjjjjeeeeennnnnnkkkkkkiiiiiiinnnnnnnsssss!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Well it was proccing for me when I was doing on bosses cuz I did it on the prime evil boss along with last man standing shotgun and the one two punch perk. Maybe I‚Äôll try it again and it got changed with today‚Äôs hot fix
---
Nice! Recently hit it myself on my main, now to work on my hunter. 
---
Also your clan sounds like a bunch of losers üòÇ
---
Are you sure? I would think Liars handshake plus the new arcstrider top tree Buffs could at least be on par
---
I hit 490 minutes
---
Jeez man. The good old days. Also I think it‚Äôs common for my type of ps3 to do that. It‚Äôs the one that you slide open to put the disc in. That stupid slidey thing always gives the disc a hard time and you have to keep closing it and praying that it reads the disc. 
---
Reminds me of ps2 when you had to pray for it to read as well lol
---
The entire point of an mmo is to gain power. Don't be a twat.
---
Huh weird, well thanks for your help explaining things, this was bugging the hell outta me lmao

---
When you're doing the kalli challenge...
---
Gotta wait for solar week
---
Got my 1k last raid I did before update. 19th clear. Got my 2nd 1k 2 weeks later during my 20th clear alongside another vigilance wing after the update.
---
EDZ easy, while there was the bright skies of the cosmodrome the EDZ has the super awesome looking shard of the traveler with it's storm like effects, plus the terrain of the EDZ is a lot more varied, personally cosmodrome was my least favorite place in D1 because of how dull the actual terrain felt, though it was still cool for the post apocalypse feel, I'll give it to you on the enemy spawn design though, while I love the drop pods (well ... Love and hate) the spawns in the cosmodrome were more generally better it felt like
---
As for your point on art of d1 being better as far as landscaping goes I really don't understand, since while patrol areas in D1 were beautiful, looking out beyond them wasn't nearly as interesting as it is now I'm (except the moon and the dreadnought, looking at other planets is always dope as hell, plus felwinter peak was amazing) wheras here we have places like To, Nessus, Titan, and even the EDZ, which give us absolutely gorgeous scenery even beyond the patrol area (I'd say even more beautiful than the patrol area for Io)
---
For people liking d1 art better I'd chalk it up to a.) Nostalgia and b.) The texture?/rendering style was significantly different in d1, and definitely gives the game a completely different feel/look to it, it think that actually has a lot to do with the contention, as that part I feel was better in d1 even if it was less advanced (just guessing on the advanced part), everything (armor especialy) had a different sheen? to it that for seem reason felt more distinct than now, even though I'd say in total the game art has improved
---
North America, and when the time comes, I'll invite you and tell you that it's me in a Whisper.

I am on Xbox
---
Go Figure is my bae. Have 2 with the exact same rolls (Outlaw, Rampage, stability MW, and targeting adjuster mod. It's a goddamn laser.) that are used by both my Titan and Hunter. I'm a casual so I haven't started the search/grind for Blast Furnace yet. One day I'll get over my fireteam anxiety and start farming.
---
Oh no the reddit joke police...
---
It's not you fucking idiot. That's an edit someone made. Be sure of what you are saying before acting like a smartass.
---
It‚Äôs still there . Got it on all my characters

What‚Äôs that gold ghost shell ?

His little rant after getting spat out from Madam Space Meatball sure as hell pissed me off.

Yeah no lighthearted fun in this meme chat... üòÇ

Shure it is!!:)

I belive its the Snowball ghost from the last time The Dawning was around

I have got 8 crooked fangs from my prime engrams today . I swear it‚Äôs the new edge transit .

That's an insane drop from 1 chest

Hello Drifter Man, Me Titan Vanguard.

Stop being evil.

Or else I'll punch. I like to punch!

Me will probably punch anyway.

Thanks

Warlock jumps = platforming ez mode

This is so badly true :D

Not quite sure that anyone cares lmao. But you do you

That‚Äôs why ‚ÄúHoundish‚Äù is the way to go for Destiny news.

Still farming them for god rolled weapons  like toil and trouble, nightshade or service revolvers.
---
Destiny 3: Fuck you
---
There was a destiny pixel game if I remember. My friend and I played it, it had he very first strike boss in the game as the final boss, it wasn‚Äôt very long but it sure was fun
---
There's nothing wrong with clearing ads, it's super important all the time. The whole idea of teaching someone the raid is that you teach them the mechanics. "Shoot the bad guys" is the one part literally everyone can figure out for themselves. If you put a new player on add clear they still don't know a damn thing the next time they group up. 
---
Tl;dr - Having newbies clear ads isn't sherpa it's carrying. Both are fine but very different.
---
wouldnt bottom tree be better? Longer duration and two shields?
---
i find the void detonators do so much more
---
cause even if you dont get a major kill for the perk you have the void dets replenishing everything for you and allies
---
I did, not much of a grind. Just power level to 50 and transfer your gear.
---
ok, good to know, thank you for pointing that out. I will proceed with caution. Once more thank you!
---
Nope, you're not the only one that thinks so. 7th column with golden gun? Good luck with that
---
I don't know, man. I personally think he just can't accept that he can't use it.
---
It's not Xol and it's not large enough to be a worm god it's smaller than Xol and according to the lore from the exotic helmets you get after beating him he's the smallest one so it can't be a worm god make a mutated sea snake or something?
---
RIP badlanderüò≠üò≠
---
So something like Layered Armor in other games I like it
---
TeThEr MaN bAd
---
I changed his eyes to the picture of the black hole that was recently released
---
Also Xol is not dead, Just his physical form. A line of dialogue from Ana says that we have not killed him, just that we have destroyed one of his forms.
---
Love this! Always find that helmet to be so weird looking! Really different aesthetic than the usual ‚Äòlock noggin
---
It‚Äôs so annoying how he has like 10 immunity phases
---
And theyre damage based, not time based
---
Handling really isn't all that bad, since 180s have low handling.
---
Sorry?!?
---
I want to invade and specifically kill that one guy, but alas I'm a collector, not my job.
---
Sad but true it‚Äôs also extremely easy to jukenout because Goldie doesn‚Äôt get third person so if there‚Äôs a column or some type of cover you‚Äôll playing ring around the Rosie, and that‚Äôs if you don‚Äôt get shotgunned because you have zero damage resistance
---
Not Xol. Just a sea monster that lives in Titan‚Äôs methane sea. Probably eats your guardian if you fall in, though.
---
Yup, missed that one
---
your clan, good relationship there. My clan in the other hand, desert, very inactive and not a lot of member but I must stay, they helped me with the Whisper of the Worm quest. I wish my clan grew big like yours one day.
---
Shaders and armor set?
---
How is a game journalist meant to tell you what the game is like when they didn't play the game properly? I wouldn't tell and scream about it but anything that person has to say about the game is worthless because of it.
---
Understood, nerfing sidearms
---
It‚Äôs awesome dude. Here‚Äôs an upvote
---
Reset is 120, not 80
---
I did savathuns at 700 and it was fucking hard. Granted I was in an LFG fireteam, we used no mics. Had a melting point addict and a nova bomb suicide bomber... but it was tough. I would level up a bit and find a good team that communicates. I was running tether and orpheus. The invis dodge helped immensely with keeping my constantly dead fire team alive but the thrall at the end never stop coming, combined with 2 giant knights. An immune boss and wizards it gets real. There is hiding spots to the right behind the speakers or up on the rocks where the boss goes after being on the right side. 
---
Good luck guardian.
---
Doesn‚Äôt need to. Last update added Forsaken exotics to the fated engrams :). Last random world drop Forsaken exotic I need.
---
We have such sights to show you.
---
Mine started at 261 and when I restarted was at 328
---
Wait so the leviathan is a black hole qith a metal cover
---
OMG IT FINALLY MAKES SENSE
---
Me: *draws sword*
---
Also me: **ALRIGHT BOYS LETS DO THIS**
---
We are bringing Mayhem back so you can play with new arc abilities they said.
---
Hunters: meh
---
Yes, nerf Luna and NF. The guns that people put countless hours and tons of effort into getting. Nerfing them would be a slap in the face. They‚Äôre easily countered by snipers and pulses. Play outside of its range, and you win.
---
I don‚Äôt see why everyone has troubles with the puzzle room for Shuro. It‚Äôs pretty straight forward
---
Maybe the armour of solstice of heroes, after getting the legendary armour, you can put orange, blue or purple glow.

---
Here an example.
---
I'm not your guy, friend
---
Haha I will even though I‚Äôm on break
---
Probably. Without Activision, they need a source of money. Would be nice for something cool to not be pay only. All the Whisper, Thunderlord, and Thorn skins are already pay only.
---
The best part of the raid isn‚Äôt shooting bad guys it‚Äôs about completing the more challenging and fun aspect. This is why sotp might be a decent raid but basically all you do is shoot guys. I personally hate being put on ad duty. I also don‚Äôt trust anyone to do anything correctly.
---
Am confused about this post
---
I'll need to get myself 1
---
THERE
---
Report them and move on. Running as a six stack in QP is fine but to spend the time to be an ass after is just stupid. Everyone please report players like this.
---
It is, but there are 2 big problems
---
A. You can't stand on the same plate twice. Even random stuff like getting pushed onto one or stepping on it without noticing can completely ruin a run. All the keeping track and switching gets confusing.
---
B. It glitches out a lot. At one point we lost at the puzzle room because it only showed us 3 tiles
---
I usually get em near point blank so I don't blow up too.... most of the time, I nick em with a grenade, or if I hit em with jotunn at range then they get the shoulder tackle, that one is fun, like rock paper scissors on who wins it.
---
why you gotta put em on blast like that
---
There is no warning that the Slovabomb is coming for you, it‚Äôs scary lol
---
 
---
If anybody want it this tees
---
I'll never understand why people think that others shouldn't try to win a game. That's why we play games, to have fun. Sometimes it's not as fun when you lose badly, but you're an adult and you can get over it and move on to the next game. It reminds of when smart kids in school would get teased for knowing the answer. Why do you want to bring good players down to a lower level, don't you want to try to get better and be on their level? 
---
Look at any other game, you don't want to see your favorite sports team give up half way through a game because they are doing too well, you want to see them stomp the opposition. Both teams are trying to achieve the same goal... do well, and win.
---
I think the bigger issue is we have two floating nukes in the sky
---
Absolutely dope
---
Indeed it could make a clusterfuck of ideas what a person is running, at least in PvP scenarios. But on the other hand I'd love to have a system of transmuting or selecting already acquired skins for the armor pieces.
---
This is why people love to hate on the destiny community. I‚Äôm just looking for some help ok
---
I wanted that gun so badly a sniper that you can choose whether to be in your secondary or primary slot
---
Darth Vadar? Is that you?
---
well my clan puts me on Ads but they also teach me the shit they're doing so I get to know the job and still do the shit I love
---
long live using Huckleberry on the Shuro Chi puzzle
---
Lol I'm only thanking him üòÇü§£
---
You say that,but if it does happen crucible will be unplayable for anyone
---
Actually, if you check the bottom left part of screen you can see how all of them are being "casted" by the same player.
---
ARC WEEK!  HERE IS MAYHEM TO PLAY WITH THE NEW ABILITIES!
---
all arc supers are melee or close range minus 1 so everyone knives/nova and titans just stay out.  Shards is broken af in mayhem.
---
Light doesn't play a full role in connecting. Could be the area you are in, time of day, or your connection. There are plenty of third party sites to help with matchmaking as well as the companion app
---
How long did it take to re-release a catalyst for Rat King? I don't expect an exit from [Battle.Net](https://Battle.Net).
---
I honestly prefer the curated from zavala man, that or basically the same but with light mag
---
There might be some adventures that spawn cabal. But if you've done the adventures already, the only other option is public events.
---
I would love to use a sword, but this freaking stomp mechanic freeeegin sucks
---
The bounty says cabal on io. I tried killing around 50 cabal on edz and it didn't give me a single sample.
---
eh, I usually just punch them 3 times and move on, in case they come back into the realm of a solid internet connection.
---
Wait.. that's illegal.
---
I've adopted this playstyle in mayhem where I just cast a nova bomb when I have it, and then go back to using my gun, got a medal yesterday for getting kills with a nova bomb that's floated for over 5 seconds
---
This shotgun is really beautiful isn't it? I love the looks if it :)
---
I don‚Äôt think what he said is true. I haven‚Äôt seen it anywhere and a bunch of people got wavesplitter from the engram when they were missing it.
---
Ahh, boo.  They fix this but not other very broken stuff!
---
Looks like it's been patched.
---
Shards should just be disabled in mayhem it's fucked up how easy it is for them to chain supers, had one guy do 3 supers in one place back to back
---
Yeah but you can make it more fair. Balance it out a little more.
---
&gt;There are light based pvp activities.
---
But you said
---
&gt;The entire point
---
Maybe you should think before you speak
---
That's true I have like 2 hunter exotics [fuck RNG]
---
If you wanna do Last Wish i can teach you and we can get a raid group going. I dont do Levi and dont know SOTP 100% but i know LW real well
---
Idk why people like pub stomping in QP it takes all the fun away when the other team isn‚Äôt on equal footing in terms of the amount of teammates
---
No problem, if you are on Xbox and need a active clan or anything, my clan is always open. Sometimes when you rejoin you find your clan has died out
---
Yeah or just bring back some other pieces of gear which look the same :(
---
‚ÄúDoes everyone understand?‚Äù
---
*wtf no*
---
‚ÄúUh yep‚Äù
---
Where this boi at? I need to absorb his
---
E n g r a m
---
They tried, my teammate died twice and left the game it was just me and everyone on the other team started hunting I just kept stalling the time and then they sent me hate mail after because I stalled the time instead of letting them kill me
---
This gets funnier each loop
---
Also, this is a pretty frequent question, so you might search around this sub a bit and see what you think of the other answers that have been given in the past. Hope that all helps, and good luck!
---
Bungie CLEARLY sucks at math because this is happening consistently
---
Best of luck Guardian! I'm on PS4, not sure which console you play on. Still learning SoTP and some lairs myself but I can guide Leviathan and Last Wish c:
---
https://tenor.com/view/starwars-gif-4591295
---
no quest this week though :/
---
"We are aware of Spectral Blades."
---
That Thorn and The Last Word are exclusively for PvP, and PvE players such as myself shouldn't even try for them.
---
thank you for answering! im going to try it and i think i will enjoy it like last time when i played d2!
---
Oh it is, but the fact that this is worse than the Hammerhead dilemma is just absolutely bonkers. The inability for a guaranteed RR exotic that's one of the best in the game is certainly a problem that really needs to be addressed, like what happened with Hammerhead.
---
will do!
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I wish you good fortune in the wars to come!
---
Will you be my destiny friend?
---
Nah, gimme some new sets, and just perk the old ones and we're donezo, with so much new stuff to hunt for you cab even make some 'old' armor heroic strike specific, like in the old days!
---
I did always like that chest piece for the Titan.  I might have to dust it off here soon.
---
‚ÄúYeah you see that big black ball, go and hug it.‚Äù
---
I'm assuming you used the rotation method?  I can't even imagine doing the non-rotation method of Gauntlet without good communication.
---
I can be teaching the raid and will still do this. It's my little payback for them taking 3 hours in gauntlet.
---
Still takes some skill despite what people think.  Throw a target adjuster mod on and go to town.
---
I have 3/4ths of the exotic weapons in the game and I have yet to find one I like more than Graviton. My first exotic in D2 was Ace of Spades though.
---
Is that bow the Curated one, if so thats the second time I have ever seen it.  Before the bow got random rolls and could drop anywhere I saw it once ever.
---
I want that bow.....
---
Because it's a braindead ability. Easy mode. Fun fact, warlocks are the most OP class it's just warlock players are too stupid to realize it.
---
It‚Äôs not curated, my mate got it out of the chest before Morgeth
---
Dew it
---
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what we said. We said ‚ÄúThorn and Last Word are primarily for PvP, so PvE players such as yourself shouldn‚Äôt expect to get them without spending time in the Crucible.‚Äù
---
Maybe a stronger version of that says ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt torture yourself doing an activity you dislike to get weapons that aren‚Äôt great in the activities you actually like to do.‚Äù
---
Anybody telling you to not even try was not following the talking points laid out in the memo. 
---
I hope you got them both.
---
Arbalest is from the Revelry event that starts next week. I believe Bungie said it would be added to the loot pool after the event ends, and has a chance to drop like Thunderlord did.
---
Lol what? Just look at what class every top streamer is using. All Hunters for PvP
---
It is down to rng... Bungie could turn the drop rates up for Spare Rations but then you'd have the same group of people who get 1 Outlast and a bazillion Spare Rations. Just keep at it is all I can say.
---
Nope it‚Äôs been hidden not new
---
My god I just noticed you can see the rest of him below the platform.
---
he dieded. Zavala killed him because he was hitting on Ada
---
I did my first SOTP the other day, didn't finish (and I was admittedly awful) but it was so much fun and everyone was really sweet
---
The curated isn‚Äôt that great honestly. Rangefinder and rapid hit just don‚Äôt feel all that great together.
---
Redrix sucks though. A god roll Bygones or Blast Furnace is more consistent than it. 
---
I play solo as well. I got my Recluse and Mountaintop in a 2 stack. I use my favorite gear (Valkaydn, Agamid, Quickstep, No Feelings) as well but I'm still able to play successful with it. 
---
Because quickplay doesn't have SBMM. I don't really have an opinion on SBMM or not.
---
What shader is on your pulse rifle??
---
Found who sided with the vanguard.
---
Hey I missed out as well but I'm max light so i been doing nothing but Gambit
---
Multi kills IS NOT seventh column üòÇ 
---
Multi kills shows how many double or triple kills you‚Äôve done in a short amount of time. 
---
Seventh column means you‚Äôve RAPIDLY killed 6 of them plus most likely spawn trapped the next guy in their spawn causing it to be 7. But you can only do this in a rapid succession. It‚Äôs about a second or less per kill on each enemy.
---
Hunter main: Definitely hunter. If speed, precision, or stealth is your thing, definitely Hunter. 
---
* Arcstrider subclass is a nice roaming super, plus a setup that gets you instant melee and dodges. And it's stupid fast, with the fastest run speed out of any subclass or class. 
---
* Nightstalker is uber good against PvE bosses (Check out some of my posts), not to mention invisibility possibilities.
---
* Gunslinger is also really good against PvE bosses (but I run Nightstalker, not Gunslinger, so don't go looking), top-tree gives you faster reloads that can stack 3 times if you get consecutive precision kills, and Blade Barrage is absolutely OP in Crucible, to the point they had to nerf it (\*sad noises).
---
Last but not least, go with what makes you comfortable! I may be biased, but I also know being a Warlock - Ultimate Space Wizard,  or a Titan - that literally smashes walls down with their head, can be anyone's cup of tea.
---
Hope this helps, and good luck guardian!
---
That's a pulse rifle, but I'm also interested in the shader
---
Literally in all my years of both D1 and D2 I've never done a raid.
---
Hahaha, well played
---
Man these are fantastic! Thank you for sharing your hard work with us. What class do you play? Or if you are like me and play all three which ones your favorite?
---
Nice. More clear your collection notifications, i won't be able to sleep tonight.
---
If you've been to the Annex and found where he is meant to be, but he isn't there, try finishing Forsaken.
---
Well, someone‚Äôs popular
---
Hey thanks! Hunter NightStalker here! I have a Warlock/Titan but rarely play them.

No offense to you brother, but I've been playing since D1Y1. I just mixed up my footage. Kind of condescending when you put it like that. But hey, no hard feelings.

Oh thats awesome! I only played Titan in Destiny 1, but moving into Destiny 2 I branched off into Warlock as well, then finally hunter and I have to say my hunter experience has been the best out of the three, they just seem to flow more and all three of their supers seem to have a definite use. Do you have any other pieces of pixel art?
