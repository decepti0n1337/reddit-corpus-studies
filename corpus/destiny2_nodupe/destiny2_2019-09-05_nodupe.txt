Am i the only one who actually likes Asher??

---
---
It might for me, but I highly doubt it. My mind works like a multi layered lock. Either you manage to change my mind by working through each of those locks or you give something with enough force behind it to break it entirely on that subject.
---

---
Destiny 2 metaphorically has 10 of those on it. I'm about dead set on leaving it entirely. The only thing I like is this sub and the games story
---
I posted a more detailed version of this earlier, but my solution was Telesto. Get that with some fusion bonus perks and Telesto everything. 
---
When I say everything, I mean EVERYTHING. It does amazingly good damage to every single mob in the game. 
---
I've heard hammers, tether, and dawnblad are the best bet for this, as is waiting for waves without yellow bars. 
---
I used tether and Telesto and got all 10 in 2-3 days.
---
No it’s the internet. You haven’t been here long have you?
---
I never have my helmet off so I'm assuming a majority also never have it off
---
This is another common answer. Never tried it, but a lot of people swear by Riskrunner.
---
Teams make certain steps so much easier. For anybody trying for this, you can solo it, but decent teammates will cut your time in half.
---
Glad to help a fellow Jojo fan
---
He’s right, you know
---
Just seems pointless.
---
wrong taken blight heroic is 100% random
---
Ha
---
yeah you right
---
EAZ
---
And whats the point of going heroic? Oh thats right exotics drop. lol ok.
---
And that’s fine. I would rather they just provided options than take out PvP, but I am biased too and wouldn’t complain if they did remove it.
---
And I get your raid issue too because I don’t really like raids either. Too convoluted and tedious. Takes too long unless you want to do it with the same people every week. That’s why I just wish they infuse the game with options. Multiple paths of progression/acquisition, in a way that balances challenge and time investment against the rewards. That way people could play what they like to earn gear. Fire example:
---
Raids could have two versions.
---
One version could be more like a long strike with multiple bosses and has matchmaking and players get A SINGLE raid reward per week. Want more rewards per week? Play the challenging LFG version with difficult mechanics that require communication and get a reward for each encounter completion.
---
Missions like Whisper and Zero Hour could also have two versions.
---
You want that new weapon right now? Play this really hard, timed, LFG only activity and it’s yours upon completion. You would rather to do it solo and don’t mind waiting to get it? Play it with no timer and each elemental burn three weeks in a row and it’s yours.
---
I just wish they made efforts to maximize the enjoyment of the game for as many types of players as possible because whether they realize or admit it or not, this game has a little bit of everything and has attracted all different types of gamers. The solution for dealing with that isn’t to try to force everyone to like and play everything. It’s to provide options to let people play what they like. It’s like they want the game do be everything to everyone but then most of what they do is the opposite of that.
---
Did you at least get ace I did
---
He really played well!!! Congratulations!!!
---
If you love tragic stories boy do i got a mind blower for you.   Read literally 99% of in-game lore, its almost all tragedy, from the books to the Exotics.
---
Game was fucking shit on release. Makes me regret breaking the rule for it. Rule 1:No Preorders!
---
Just copy the files to steamapps/common and verify, it'll be a 15GB download at most (significantly better than the entire 80-100GB).
---
Its worth more than that. 
---
The amount of content that you get is astonishing. And now with shadowkeep soon to drop with even more content and mechanics, i am afraid that i won't have enough free time to play it!
---
Not encourage and perpetuate it by continuing to implant pursuits where it makes no sense to do so.
---
Many D2 players grinded D1 into the ground. We ground the *D1 Beta* into the ground. That’s why we’ve been grinding D2 (yeah, with 3 characters a week) and looking forward to Shadowkeep. If you want your salty tears converted into free exotics you’re just a casual.
---
I wouldn't advertise, against the rules. If you have a question ask in here.
---
I’m mad about dis but I’m upvoting because it wooks cwean uwu  
---
 tag me to uwuize comments uwu
---
As a Titan main, this is one reason why I enjoy playing a Hunter so much
---
Casual and proud. This whole 'D1 Beta veteran' vs Casual is really holding the game and the devs back. So please, keep insulting the casuals. You are really doing this game and the community a favor. 
---
The fact of the matter is, I grinder for those exotics in Year 1. I'm not some stupid hamster on a wheel so I won't keep chasing after them.
---
The thrall in this boss generate orbs on death.
---
I'd forgotten how short laserfuck is if you're not wearing geomags
---
Happening to me too its so much bs. Every other game works fine but this one. mid gunfight all the time gun just stops shooting
---
It would take a decent amount of calculating, and a good memory, of which I don't have. To figure out how much I've spent entirely on Destiny. It's no small number for sure, but it's likely less than an average customer pays for any other live service model game that they heavily invest in. You are well within your right to be upset about the introduction of a Battle Pass into Destiny. When I first heard the news, I thought " this has to be fake". But alas it is not. Will it stop me from playing the game? No, should criticism be offered by the community in a respectable way. 100%. I am okay with the proposed implementation because I will likely purchase every season, unless I pre-emptively know I won't be able to play for that set of months. Bungie has likely done their research on this, and considered it a potential pro to convincing people to purchase the seasonal content. We will have to see. Happy Hunting Guardian!
---

Hunters of the world, we shall never forget the legend, the hero, the survivor of his time, constantly in pain for losing his wife and son.. We felt this pain when we lost him, and many others did.. but we have to stand strong, and honor his name as long as we will live.. We Must Honor Cayde-6.
---
I've spent about $160.00 for two years (1700 hours) of entertainment. I've only played maybe five other games in that time. Normally I'd buy around a game a month. Quite a savings I'd say.
---
So one of the wheels isn't good but the other three are just grinding?
---
I’m reposting this to r/anthemthegame
---
And his blazing Gun, added with his burning Knives, shattered the darkness one last time..
---
And then John Wick from the competing raid team wipes you all with Truth while the LFG blueberry is trying to collect more.
---
Nada. Just an Easter egg
---
How so? That's literally been in the game since forsaken lol
---
Thank you!! Will my forsaken &amp; shadowkeep purchases link to my PC account too?
---
Don’t think it is, it’s been there since the forsaken quest line came. It’s more like a easter egg.
---
I'm going to get downvoted for this, but reading these comments on destiny's pvp makes me so glad that reddit isnt in charge of this game
---
Facts!
---
A game having one replayable mode is not good
---
Lol the facial animations were not the thing that killed it. The average gamer doesnt care too much about shit like that. I didnt love the game, but for all its faults it sold decently and the average gamer apparently liked it. This just reads as your typical out of touch reddit comment
---
It’s a meme
---
So dope
---
Wait what the fuck
---
destiny 2 was no where near as bad off as anthem, it also didnt have developers jumping ship left and right after.
---
Psh ya don’t know about having to kill the wave 7 boss at exactly 0:00 back when EP started to make sure you got the kill for the weapon drops and failed the wave at the same time to start back at wave 6.
---
Voltaic Motes***
---
Thats was the only item I needed to get the title a few months ago. I did a quick run then a 200k run equipped the emblem and got it on the next run no boons I don’t trust them.
---
After this comment, I’m gonna attempt a 200k run. If it drops I’m gonna cry.
---
Time Warner must be the biggest pussy in the world. They kick me back to the title ed screen all the time.
---
Entire enemy team is equipped with truth with infinite heavy ammo and invasions are every 30 seconds
---
I use mountain top to deal with yellow bars

Shhh, careful! Casuals are downvoting you!
---
Ok ty

They're all kinda bad, but just the one is completely wrapped in hair and no longer turns.
---
I think this image would work better with Forsaken images instead of Vanilla D2. Vanilla was pretty blegh.
---
Hail to the Rat King, baby!
---
Nope, they added the seventh cataclysm arena, and all previous cat war chests for equipment. Also all the javelin armor and cosmetics from previous weeks.  Got into it late so I'm looking forward to getting my colossus armor and hopefully all the new weapons too. This is the week to get in runs and get what you want out of the cataclysm update.
---
I actually like comp now that I'm above 2500. Itd more fun than the lower ranks in my opinion.
---
Casual
---
Raids are what they are. The hardest teamwork based pve activity where communicationnis is key. A lot of the best gear Come from raids. Not just exotics like 1000voices(last wish) but legendaries like treat level (scurge of past).  There. Besides the raids are u forgetting all the other end game activities: escalation protocol. Blind well.reckoning . now menagerie. And soon shadowfall. I think u miss story fps like doom or bioshock and the old cod. I miss them too. Destiny is about playin what u want with who u want playin the way u want ans i luv it.lol . my loadouts always rotates for variaty and need. Most players have a mutiple copy of the same guns w. Random roll.better to each.scenario . u don t need to raid to b op. Just need a better understanding off the perks for customisation. Every build has its own play style whixh adds lots of replayability. People should play less often with classic builds to experiment. Im currently testin swords with a parry/healing armor. So many ways to play
---
I'll see you soon Ace.
---
* Everyone liked that *
---
Killer Instinct crashes too. At some point you gotta wonder if it's the game or the system. 
---
For the record I played surge on PS4.
---
Is anthem still alive?
---
I think as long as it registers on your screen as a kill, it counts. 
---
So assists should work
---
that guy deserves to be taunted on for not even trying to escape
---
The game that shall not be named!
---
You clearly understand map layout, engagement zones, and target priority. You should be proud guardian. I know shaxx is.
---
*Omnigul comes out from behind the counter *

your character reminds me someone from fairly oddparents idk why though
---
With recluse
---
"THIS IS AMAZING"
---
Full Bore Accurized Outlaw Rangefinder w/ Range MW.
---
Your not wrong
---
Nice Tbag at the end. Real Chad move.
---
I bought the game last week on Amazon used for $9.10, I think it's worth it for that price.
---
Because he’s probably “over the moon” excited. 
---
Also, stop being a dick. Let the man be happy.
---
Ahhh yes, a man of culture
---
Thought "cool drawing" then I read the line and got goosebumps. Fantastic work!
---
I would say it depends on what you like to play. 
---
Hard to say in general.  For my part I‘m really enjoying the crucible, grinding for weapons that are good for it and trying them in it. 
---
If you don’t like PvP I would recommend to take a research of the weapons you’re able to get which ones you’d like to try. For sure you can try them in Strikes and whatever you like so far. 
---
For me Destiny is like collecting cards in the childhood :D 
---
There are also some exotic quests. Some of them are pretty enjoyable. 
---
Just take a research. The internet is full of info what you can do. But in the first step I would say enjoy the game and try to find out what you like. The most things are pretty self explanatory.
---
Assert dominance on pathetic hunters  and bag them
---
I only see broken wheels on that
---
Add me SplodinHippo#1768
---
Me and my friend can carry you to some sick gear
---
Congrats!  Recently got mine too 👍
---
Snipe more, things only get better in practice
---
Check out https://www.niris.tv/blog/weekly-reset
---
Good luck Guardian, I've had my Hush for a while and it's hands down my favorite bow of all time.
---
(also if you only need medals remember that First to Block and Following Orders are super easy to get and they add up!)
---
So all 4 wheels are fucked then? Because thats the D2 Vanilla art. So the cart won't move.
---
eyyyyyyyyyyyyy
---
cheers pal
---
Props
---
Isn't Forsaken the best expansion since TTK? adding 2 new playable zones, new game modes (Gambit, Forge, Menagerie), a raid +2raid lairs, a dungeon + 2 Whisper-like missions.
---
Sure, I include the season pass with it, but objectively, there hasn't been a content drought for a whole year.
---
Just to be clear, when you buy season pass content, you get "battle pass" with it. Ask WoW players how much they paid for years of playing with subscription. If you want new content in a live service game, developers have to fund them somehow. 10$ every 3 months is fine with me.
---
Or we could give him a different sniper and he gives us his no land beyond
---
You sound fun at bbqs.
---
Literal same. I was out of town over the weekend and a clan mate even ran it for me about 25 times and he couldn’t get it to drop. I don’t even want to run it anymore.
---
This is INDEED the universal way to greet other guardians
---
We got a revamp of the weapon system, perks brought back to armors, mods revamped, gambit, 2 playable PvP freeplay areas, a campaign, Forges, Menagerie, secret missions, a Triumph system, Bounties back...
---
Seriously, don't reduce Destiny's comeback to Gambit.
---
Titan.. of course
---
I said possibly, but that’s a fair point. Forsaken was one hell of an expansion.
---
It makes me sad that this poor hunter didnt know he could JUMP
---
Ok thanks
---
Lit
---
Like the Solstice of Heroes?
---
What a coincidence, I recently picked up no mans sky and honestly I couldn't even imagine what it was on release compared to what it is now, but it's still nothing more then Ark/Conan level of polish so regardless of content it's pretty buggy. (But still amazing strides by hello game)
---
Will my character data automatically be synced between PS4 and PC?
---
SEVENTH!!! COLONUM!!!
---
Emphasis on "trying" LOL
---
I mean they all *started off bad*
---
Its so bright and vibrant!  Love it!
---
nothing like a good bromance!
---
at first when I read that I was like Awwwww and then I could see clearly he friend zoned him lol
---
Thought the one on the left was Datto for a second lol
---
Wholesome though hope you 2 had a fun time lol
---
Fallout 4 reference?
---
It's TR3VRs all the way down
---
I met a good friend of mine in a wheat field in Chernarus 7 years ago. DayZ is notorious for players shooting you on sight but that time we both were pretty lucky :)
---
Also: That T-Shirt design on the left seems to be absolutely everywhere at the moment!
---
All materials,  coins, and weapon parts are now set to 9999 just for you!
---
Shadowkeep is coming and materials will be more sought after. sure, you don't need them now...but even as someone who has a large abundance of materials right now (40k gunsmith materials, 16k legendary shards, 1200 cores etc) I see no reason to fall behind. its free stuff for doing nothing. I'm sure i wont need more than what I have but i don't see why people who play less than me should pass me, so i do it too.
---
You too.? I thought I was the only one doing this kinda stuff haha
---
God rolls vary from player to player. What I like don't mean you'll like it.
---
not fixed, just sometimes you get dc'd. happens every once in a while.
---
Man, Curse of Osiris had some fantastic cutscenes and Sagira was phenomenal. I just wish she could be available as a permanent voice pack. 
---
CoO was really bland otherwise and I didn’t care for the actual missions much.
---
People use bots to AFK in gambit while NOT getting kicked since they are moving.  They do it to get loot but at the same time ruin the game for everyone else
---
Cute couple
---
This is why I only play mayhem!
---
If theirs arc damage available risk runner runs circles around recluse.
---
I could hear this.
---
Yes indeed
---
Except im wearing solstice gear
---
I don’t get it either. It’s not that quick play isn’t competitive, destiny pvp in general isn’t competitive. Destiny flat out isn’t that kind of game, it’s never going to be proper competitive like siege or a game that was built and balanced for it. Destiny is a spectacularly fun game, and it’s very good at being fun. The PvP elitists in destiny are the most cringe shit I’ve ever seen, there’s a reason they get off on pvp in destiny and not actually competitive games.
---
You sir are a man of culture (I got the Platinum for that game lol)
---
I’ve already reported your comment for breaking a rule which says to be respectful.  Just letting u know
---
Anthem is straight booty seriously I bought r super deluxe when it came out but when the devs started quitting I knew the game was donezo
---
Really? That’s awesome
---
"Yes, I'd like to report that the hive are having another unauthorized summoning ritual party."
---
I found that i actually had a harder time gearing in destiny 2 than i did in anthem. I havent played much of destiny 2 if im being completely honest, i played on launch amd a few months after that i stopped until Forsaken came out, then played for another month. But if I were to compare Anthem to Destiny 2 on release, they probably had similar drop rates (no evidence backing this besides personal experience)
---
It’s close. You really want ricochet or accurized rounds in the magazine slot for the extra range, and just any sights that add range. Some people also argue rangefinder v outlaw but it’s personal preference.
---
Most people prefer rangefinder but I prefer outlaw because I don’t have any enhanced hc loader gauntlets :(
---
If you use it and you like it that’s all that matters tho!
---
Personally, I think 2 or 3 per dismantle is fine. It's not like it's particularly hard to get Legendary Gear to begin with, and the majority of it ends up getting dismantled if it's not the right roll, or if the light levels too low.  That adds up pretty fast imo.
---
Rise of Iron would like to know your location.
---
This ornament slapped
---
It went so hard
---
What do you think i'm farming for my hunter? he already has liars so i just need a one two shotgun
---
Is there a formal rule book posting that says you can’t put on equipment you like and play the game lol
---
Not really good just feels bad ass as fuck gettin about looking like Saint -14 with his shot gun and the loadout actually be viable...
---
Did someone say titan bubble yooooo
---
Oof, I honestly didn't realise how op we got. I took a few months break from destiny, came back and turns out we can melt strike bosses now ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Must be nice to have lmao,I’m almost there
---
My anti meta loadout is bygones with mind benders
---
DID YOU SHOW THE DARKNESS WHAT LIGHT CAN DO
---
Bro thats exactly what i got. Feels pretty clean because 2 tap
---
Indeed. I slapped the bubble on the B Flag and they ran in, and never came out.
---
I'm pretty sure these are both just straight up facts, in one of the adventures he talls about his old boyfriends, and in one of the comics Anna gets to watch her non gaurdian girlfriend/ love interest die
---
Yeah those numbers were from about 12 -14 hours ago. I did 12 in total over 2 days, only got 1 Node I needed which is pissing me off as well, need 10 more, which is why I stopped doing them in the first place.
---
I should probably mention i already have the base game somehow (I think blizzard gave it to me on battlenet for free at some point) so all I'd need to buy are the expansions?
---

---
I'm just commenting on the general stupidity of people who are against vegetarianism/veganism. If you like eating meat and you also like a livable planet you should endorse others to be vegetarian because the planet you live on literally can't handle everyone consuming massive amounts of meat so you *need* others to be vegetarians. Picking on them out of spite is very big stupid.

ea spending all the dev money on people to post on reddit and downvote stuff in the destiny 2 sub

"duped"? As in pull them from collectors for what, a few shards a piece.
---
(AFK farm the forge &gt; turn materials into shards via spider or whatever &gt; get a ton of othersides from collectors.)
---
It’s a toss up I’d say go in alone and practice the jumping on both your bound to find someone to do it with and as long as you have the jumping down you’ll be okay
---
gotcha, cheers!
---
Sweet Buisness
---
Who is she, and/or what is the white haired girl putting on the red glove from. I am blanking.
---
pretty sure what you just said is the reason they do this. if they don't like gambit but they need to "complete matches" for some kind of reward, this is what they do.
---
It doesn’t.
---
I don't want to dismantle all. Keep some that I might use. Transmats give dirt cheap bright dust anyway.
---
In terms of exotics and pinnacles, Riskrunner, Breakneck, and SUROS Regime are my favorites.
---
Calus Mini-Tool (Menagerie) and Ringing Nail (Forges) are ones you can grab anytime.
---
On PS4 I haven't played crucible for a few but it did way to often
---
nobody said nation of beasts? seriously? the curated roll is basically fatebringer.
---
Again, if you don’t have any actual answers to the question at hand, why the fuck are you commenting at all?  Move along scrub.

I like the idea of them swapping roles for like a short time event.

"Well done guardian. Hone those skills, because whether we like it or not we have stepped into a war with the Cabal...."
---
How to get it?
---
This's This
---
Oh shit! I thought it was a heavy :(
---
Hmm I have that one, so I will try to get it :)
---
HAHAHA
---
My internet be like
---
better not, i dont want too turn into fanta
---
Indeed
---
The community event is just filler since they pushed the shadowkeep release back
---
I 100% agree. I also feel like all this community kill is a test of some sort of new counter system on their end. Might be leading up to some sorta new event for a raid or something.
---
Bungie gave us a challenge to do a bunch of stuff on mars as a community, hence ‘community challenge’.
---
If we do complete it, participants will get a unique emblem, and extra menagerie rewards, adding one more drop each week until the season ends. (You’ll get 5 drops per chest in the final week of the season)
---
thats a slug shotgun like chaperone that requires a headshot to kill, and no it wont kill at 14m because the range caps off at 11.5-12 metres which was found through testing. regardless, the other guy seems clueless / new so idk why im still here.
---
True. But RC's have a taste. Some people don't know the difference...and I feel bad for those people.
---
I get your point, but what are you even supposed to do if you just get all of your progression carried over? Did you really want to spawn into destiny 2 already at max level, with a full armory of exotics and legendaries? I feel your pain, but destiny 2 is not an expansion to D1, it’s a sequel. Besides a few cosmetics, there’s no reason for any of your gear to carry over, from a gameplay standpoint, a marketing standpoint and even a consumer standpoint
---
Get the hell off our subreddit, and don't dare spread that agenda here again or you will face an immediate ban if i ever catch you encouraging anti-vax again. See this comment removal as you fucking warning
---
Have u tried to strafe or to shoot and move at the same time?
---
At least Titans still have a vanguard.
---
9.4.18  never forget.
---
You could probably do some math about how often the "enemies move against each other" and how long it's been since D2's launch. Could be kinda fun to see I think.
---
Yes
---
House of wolves wasn’t that bad
---
No but what I mean is we have so much room to explore just here and now, and the general feeling is well be leaving the solar system in the next few expansions or the very last one before D3
---
Why blur the name expose these clowns
---
I'll still watch youtube while I just run around and jump/granade/shoot lmao i need that powerful engram buddy
---
They're worse on PC. Anti-AFK macros exist. Basically, someone can write a keyboard macro to wait 5 seconds, and then send a spacebar key-press event on an infinite loop, causing the AFKer's character to jump in place every 5 seconds. Destiny doesn't care what you do, unless you're standing completely still for too long; thus, a macro to just jump can keep AFKers from getting booted.
---
Source: about 20 Crucible/Gambit matches with inconsiderate, AFKing jerks.
---
Well, since you'll have a flood of comments suggesting fusion rifles I'll avoid that.
---
The Last Dance. I use it all the time. Love it.
---
Damnit why didn’t I think of that instead of the stupid Valus Ta’aurc
---
As I said, I don't know what I expected. Definitely not just an emblem and shader though. 
---
It just doesn't seem right to be at the same exact position as someone who just picked up the game and hasn't put any time into Destiny 1.
---
Like at the beginning when the tower is under attack you have to gear up and log into your (old) vault and ghost says there's not enough time so you can pick only 1 exotic weapon or 1 exotic armor before the vault is destroyed. Or after you finish the game you can redeem them from your collection since you already got them from year 1. You still have to pay the currency so they would let me know that all the time I invested in Destiny 1 wasn't for nothing. 
---
Maybe something along those lines.
---
Approved.
---
there are different mechanics for all of them, here is a guide on how to make every event heroic.

**I'D LIKE TO SEE ZAVALA TRY AND STOP ME!**
---
So even killing like 10 hives can be counted as participated or it has to be some minimum amount
---
“How many times do we have to teach you this lesson old man?”
---
Unfortunately, I’m on PS4. Thanks for the offer though!
---
That information is very helpful. Thank you very much!
---
Big sized + bottom barrel = substantially less recoil
---
What?
---
They wouldn’t be called hand CANNONS if they weren’t huge
---
You can't charge while teleporting and teleporting takes a substantial amount of super energy. A non charged explosion barely has range and can not 1 shot guardians. I was definitely paying attention to my surroundings and seeing how players easily run away and jump away as you charge up because of how you slow down. You have to fully or mostly charge to.1 shot a guardian and in that time they can easily run away or stay out of range. 
---
And so what, it don't matter if every super can kill it in that time before nova warp can do a thing. Because of the nerf nova will be even weaker and they're won't be a reason to use it since every roaming super out performs it in every way
---
Hand cannons are easily the size of a hunter thigh.
---
“Oh ho ho, I can’t WAIT to see what you do with that!”
---
Someone doesn't play crucible obviously if you actually think nova warp is like that now.
---
Shouldn't it be grey? With Cayde-6 being dead and all.
---
I feel for you btw, Reckoning sucks. The changes sound like they made it slightly more bearable, but I wouldn’t know because I finished MMXIX last week *HAH*
---
You have no idea how much I hope that they get rid of the bitch pistol grenade launcher meta
---
You fucking what? Isn't the Last Word supposed to be crafted by Tex Mechanica? The same guys who made Chaperone, 4th Horseman, Prospector and of course the First Curse? I'm getting a little bit lost

Maybe [this](https://xboxclips.com/SoulessBastrd/31df04f8-d7cb-4ada-b08a-cde47639fcc6) will help you feel better? Sweet revenge for getting spawn killed by an OEM Titan 6 times in a row.

Are macros particularly hard to detect for anti-cheat?  Why doesn’t bungie simply treat this as someone using a hack and ban the account?
---
I use the super and it will 1 hit kill low resilience guardians. I just don’t charge it ..... ever. If I run into groups I will spam the melee.
---
Hurry up with the final movie Hideaki, so I can complain about it.
---
I never really realized. Hand cannons on first person seem a lot smaller. Maybe is because the FOV on console actually zooms a lot more than it should.
---
All you really did is trade one bitch pistol for another now people are using spare rations. Really the thing to do would be make another weapon class stronger. Scouts haven't been in play ever. Autos haven't been in play since release.

Gotta be careful man, slipping all over these rocks is dangerous
---
No, I started a gambit match today and someone knocked on my door wanting me to join their religion and when I came back I was back in orbit saying I was idle.
---
I mean... Yeah, that's a good point.
---
They have disable silver purchase intill shadowkeep launch so they won't let you söndag more money yet
---
No. No. No. No.
---
Just.
---
No.

Am I a Hunter with a one-eyed mask... or a Titan with a cape?
---
Last piece I need too. Has not dropped from an engram yet. It hasnt been available as I have been buying whatever piece is there for all my characters. Bright Dust only I mean.
---
as a warlock player its perfectly fine where its at right now. and yes reading the comments hand supernova is fucking brutal with con hold giving damage reduction and energy back
---
That's why we have Americans on this subreddit, for gun logic purposes
---
Idk about low resilience but last I checked it did require 2 explosions to actually kill non super guardians. You really do need to mostly charge the explosion to actually 1 shot. Also you're assuming if people don't notice you at all. The second they do they can either easily teamshot or run from you.
---
Probably because it would cut the player base in half
---
Tuesday night during a raid my friend’s Well wasn’t reloading with Lunas
---
Same I'm so pissed because the set is badass and universal ornaments are coming.
---
No there Will be a TWAB
---
I thought it was because we're ugly as fuck
---
Need to find me a team like this. No ones dedicated enough lol
---
Your right, and i was kinda triggered. I have been running these missions all week and no idea i was being a nub.
---
cursed
---
Well, you're making your computer execute code to make your character move slightly to avoid being detected by AFK/idle detection within the game's code so you can farm, while ruining everyone else's experience...I'm gonna go out on a limb and say yes...since there's a line in the ToS that says it's against ToS to violate other people's enjoyment of their ToS.

---
We dont know how fast the reload animation will be after the nerf, it could be just as fast as dodging
---
Will affect powerful drops I believe. From what I’ve heard duplicate class characters don’t allow for double powerful rewards for that class, mostly to stop powering up abuse most likely.
---
It would be difficult since all D2 is seeing is key-press events; nothing is hooking into Destiny, or altering Destiny's memory locations.
---
Maybe one day we will have some sort of Heuristic anti-AFK like we have with some anticheat; but for now most macros just look like the player rolling their face across their keyboard, as far as the client and server sides are concerned.
---
Its really not tho, it can use a bit of buffing in areas since you have to charge it just to kill people in melee range. Which they easily can just run from you. And handheld isn't really on its own. Its just a version of shoulder charge but for warlocks. And that's with an exotic where it's really strong which makes sense since it requires you to use an exotic which you can only have 1 of. But outside of it its only as strong as shoulder charge except you have to aim with handheld.
---
Don’t worry, it’s not a cabal weapon. TLW is a pinnacle achievement of human engineering
