Or mountain top
---
---
---
Man if i knew that it was eventually gonna drop from strikes and stuff i wouldn't have grinded my ass off in the faction rallies lol
---
Even tho titans are op rn
---
Remember when titans did stuff for the team lol
---

---
I feel like if a post goes ‚Äúmust have/be‚Äù constantly, there‚Äôs a problem
---
Of course right after I post that it‚Äôs working fine for me again too. Guess the put a new hamster on the wheel.
---
It's true
---
Who let this guy drink the dumfuk juice?
---
Kinky.
---
I like Shaxx ~~'s taste~~
---
With no turning back, i can shoot arrows blindfolded and still do precision kills.
---
Literally have no idea what "runninar dou" is supposed to mean I was super fucked up when I made this post
---
For pve only thing I would change is look for archers tempo with a reload masterwork.
---
I play a lot of solo.
---
Expect your glory to rubberband a bunch.
---
And be ok with crying.... like a lot.
---
I can‚Äôt do that
---
Cuz no cares
---
Ooooh ok, even the power level of items?
---
God this brings back horrible memories of running trials with buddies back in the day.
---
TITAN! YOU CAN HAVE UP TO 3 GRENADES (3RD ONE WITH EXOTIC) AND PUNCH PEOPLE WITH HANDS, GUNS, SWORDS, SUPERS AND EVEN WITH THOSE GRENADES! IF YOU ONCE WONDERED *HOW IT WOULD BE TO PUNCH A BOSS TO DEATH?* THEN YOU CAN CHECK THIS OUT YOURSELF! DON'T UNTIL TOMMOROW! BECOME TITANBRO TODAY!
---
I just got back into D2 recently as well (I took a break just before black armory was released). 
---
Don‚Äôt be afraid though man! It‚Äôs f‚Äôn Destiny! I always find that even if I get a bit bored of content (or lack of), I can always jump back in.  Hope you do the same!
---
Destiny fo life lol
---
F
---
I'll be re downloading it tonight and start at the grind again there. You got me inspired. If you're on Xbox, my Reddit is my gtag.
---
Me: I swear on the light if you add another fucking taken phanalax bos-
---
 Bungie: the corrupted appears
---
Me: NIüÖ±Ô∏èüÖ±Ô∏èA
---
Never mind I figured it out
---
It‚Äôs was regular size
---
Go to your director( where you hold your ghost out) and go to the left pursuits should be there
---
Spicy ramen. *nice*
---
In the directory, on the far left. I.e, if you start at planet/activity selection, press Lb a few times.
---
lol, excellent enthusiasm
---
Reminds me of those old D1 montages. Don‚Äôt see them too much anymore. Nice stuff.
---
yes, and with the new expansion in september it will be great. In your case, wait for the new expansion to drop. it‚Äôll give you all y1 content for free and you can try that. and then buy shadowkeep if u plan on staying.
---
This is the best video of destiny ive ever seen. Very well done!
---
i sure do like team whiping kids with it xD
---
I would say do the campaigns first. It's useful to have all the planets unlocked, and you need to finish Forsaken anyway in order to get the 690 "catch up" gear from Benedict. 
---
Besides that, crucible matches, adventures, or stacking heroic public events + patrols all work pretty well. Be sure to pick up bounties for whatever activity you're doing, those also give XP.
---
But how does that contribute to the team, just don‚Äôt die
---
I told my cousin once ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the kind of guy to choose a bow over a gun for a few reasons. 1) Style points. 2) It‚Äôs fun.‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt contain my excitement when I saw the pinnacle weapon was a bow, even more so that it‚Äôs from Gambit. Which, despite what I‚Äôve seen A LOT of people say, I quite enjoy. I also like the aesthetic. I should have Hush by this upcoming weekend.
---
You would usually get a powerful reward for playing one match and one powerful reward for playing 4 more matches after that one. This resets every week.
---
Not sure how direct boost to 30 works or what collector version includes, (Forsaken i guess,?), but i thought the main campaign was fun to play so yea don't skip that. The other smaller DLCs after the main campaign are not a must imo.
---
____________
---
You are raid ready whenever you feel like. Whenever you have a good diversity of weapons and certain exotics. **A popular weapon for raids is the Ikelos shotgun which can be a pain to get, but it only drops from the escalation protocol from certain bosses**
---
It's a bit tedious but it's worth it. Look it up in r/dedtinythegame under useful links.
---
I assume you went with a hunter, so you need to look out for certain exotics. The Celestial nighthawk helmet will give your golden gun 6x damage. Perfect for bosses (Use with bottom tree of gunslinger). Orpheus Rigg return super for tethered enemies with the shadow shot super. It's super useful in raids.
---
It depends on what raid you wanna take on. There are smaller, bigger, less complicated and harder ones.
---
Year1 and Year2 loot are different. Year1 raids includes Leviathan (main game), Eater of Worlds (Curse of Osiris), Spire of Stars (Warmind). Only Leviathan really has weapons worth the chase in Year1. The hand cannon and pulse rifle to be specific. The armor is unfortunately inferior to Year2 armor.
---
If you own the annual pass, Scourge of the Past is a relevant and easy raid. But you want to take at least D.A.R.C.I with you. It's an exotic sniper rifle in the heavy slot. If you don't own the pass then try Eater of worlds or Leviathan first. Spire of stars is a bit harsh for newcomers. 
---
Last wish (Forsaken, 580 level) is currently by far the biggest raid in the game and it takes general raid experience to beat it, altough it should not be a problem to run it the first time if your team mates are decent.
---
You may also want to look up raid guides unless you want to run them blind.
---
______________
---
Another thing:
---
Tuesday is the weekly reset (Refreshes powerful drops, vendors, modifiers etc.)
---
Thursday is Information/maintenance day. Bungie will always share upcoming info and patch notes if there are any to look after. They call it This Week At Bungie. Both subs, this and r/destinythegame will post them on their respective sites. There will also be ingame messages showing up what's coming up next week.
---
Friday is when Xur arrives. Some tentacle faced vendor. He brings exotics each weekend and disappears when the weekly reset happens. He sells random exotics for legendary shards and his location is random, so you need to look up the internet to find him.
---
I read it in Christopher Judge's voice. Everytime I read indeed all I can hear is Teal'c. It's a symptom of my childhood love of SG-1.
---
Thanks wasn't sure what was going on or if I was looking in the wrong place.
---
"bubbles up!" Oh the good old d1 raiding days.
---
No dude no worries at all you're good. I was talking about shattering strike. If you have 7 minutes to check it out here a video comparing it to melting point. https://youtu.be/gu0xzuxS9sw tell me what you think!
---
I used it until I got revoker. It‚Äôs a great sniper
---
15 isn‚Äôt no where near what to expect if you do 15 strikes and expect a catalyst you crazy!, I‚Äôd say between 50/100, but again that‚Äôs RNG, I have only just got the suros regime one and I put in 9 hours on the game almost daily.. 2 hours at least grinding strikes (lake of shadows recently)
---
I'm sure it's the same as what ever triggered it the first time. I'm not sure what it was though.
---
Is speed running effective or is getting higher score by killing more enemies better?
---
Is she one of those "Get a girlfriend already, I want grandchildren!" mums?
---
I‚Äôm so happy you enjoy my autobiography series
---
DELAWARE SMASH!!! ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
IM DEAD
---
HOW THE FUCK
---
That's fine because it's either:
---
Banter with friends or
---
An accident.
---
Being a Richard and charging a poor man that just wants to get mountaintop is not ok.
---
Just did the heroic for my first time and trevor is just the best. I hope bungie puts something like Trevor in shadowkeep
---
pov 105 then look till you laugh
---
Los like she‚Äôs from Steven universe
---
I remember very little from most of my college courses. On the bright side I can still navigate Runescape by memory and I havent legitimately played that game in almost 10 years...
---
Glad he learned how to press Q and the occasional E maybe an R
---
I used to love that Hunter cloak.
---
I haven't played D2 since the forges came out, my group fell apart (other games) and I didn't enjoy playing as a solo. Lol hopefully you get heavy ammo next time
---
This. I tried to do all three runs on Tuesdays whenever possible but sometimes things just came up. So I'd just skip to riven on all 3 characters and only do queens walk on the 3rd run.
---
Nah, not really, honestly. I already fell for that in the past. Besides, there is so much better stuff coming this year that I feel deserve more attention and support.
---
Bygones w/ headseeker and rampage is what I use. Shreds
---
Nah son, erentil basically has infinite range and the fastest charge time I've ever fucking seen, it's bullshit dying to it
---
You left us on a cliff hanger. What about that next shot?
---
Fucking christ man bungie holds nothing as sacred anymore for titans it's such a fucking joke that the class even exists anymore.
---
If I have children, I'm reading them the Books of Sorrow as bedtime stories.
---
I won't say what i do to titans whp dp this to me. But feel assured they regret it significantly =).
---
I played crucible for the first time in almost a year and couldn‚Äôt believe it when I went on a 22 kill streak. Shoutout to the bots in the lobby I guess
---
Nice :)
---
They will replace them, once activated. However, if you choose to deactivate cross save, you can restore those characters that were 'replaced'.
---
Ha! There it is props to the photoshop
---
OH GAWD NO
---
Love that idea yes please. The terror when you hear trevor behind you is unparalleled.
---
Ive just gotten into the destiny lore and im starting with the hive, books of sorrow toland ect and byf/ focus fire chat podcast are literally the best
---
Crucible is...what Crucible does.
---
You‚Äôll get there. I used to hate comp but after getting recluse, I think I‚Äôm addicted, because winning in comp is so satisfying, more satisfying then comp wins in OW
---
Earlier today I could open up but my character weren‚Äôt updating and when I tried to make lfg post it was saying same to update the character.
---
This guy knows what's up
---
Got stomped the other day in 3v4. Gotta get this game cannon/ grenade launcher  kills ! We stick it out ya know ?!
---
Titans: I'm the wall that guards the realm of men
---
Every other class: I'm a fucking bulldozer
---
Yep with some armor perks it‚Äôll kill over 70 meters
---
Sorry and thank you
---
RS6 and D2 two of my favourite games
---
Just want to say i love you : )
---
The New shotgun from menagerie (imerial decree) but you need a god roll on it
---
Honestly it would be so much better for English exams if we could read a book of our choice that were actually interested in. 
---
Rather than some book from 20-1,000 years ago
---
Must be Bobwithnomic
---
If you want this just play borderlands
---
I bet he'll get catapulted to yesterday upon firimg a fusion rifle
---
Just bought the game on Xbox, since everything was only $40. I avoided the first destiny, because people talked a lot of shit about it on release. I also avoided this one, because people talked a lot of shit about it on release. Despite this, I have had my eye on D2 for a while. I just wasn‚Äôt willing to fork over all the contents of my wallet to play a game that I didn‚Äôt know would be good. 
---
I‚Äôm glad for this sale and the f2p plans, because it  has gotten me into the game. I actually really, really like it. I probably never would have tried it otherwise. At least, this is my perspective from the outside looking in.
---
PLUS ULTRA
---
Please stahp
---
Now I just need to find a grp who wouldn't mind helping me do the raid so I could have beginners luck!
---
Just like every nightfall loot grind
---
Claro, claro.
---
First of all: I genuinely thank you for being the only person that gave an actual answer to my question instead of saying this is a shit post and second: Believe it or not I still do good in the Crucible despite making this post and I still have fun. I think that just because I made a post complaining about an actual issue (that maybe I pushed a bit too far) people seem to think I'm just absolute trash
---
Only in PvP in they blink. That glide turns them into a slow moving target.
---
Of course melting point is a debuff to enemies .. how did you just find this out? Tether is essentially the same but with damage share, suppression, etc but like the other guy said, hard to compare a melee to a super, and honestly idk why you are.
---
I gained 3-4% per match using too tree storm caller with crown and some weapons with demolitionist (specifically epicurean).  Basically super as much as possible and get enough kills for the ride the lightning medal.  You can easily get 3-4 a match.   Then if you win, you get other medals for that.
---
happy cake day, guardian!
---
Waiting for Solar shell ghost cuz I main solar warlock.
---
He just equipped a shotgun
---
I don‚Äôt blame you bro! That was a pretty awful grind as well. I was burnt tf out after Malfeasance. Then Gambit Prime dropped and played that for about a reset and didn‚Äôt want to play Gambit ever again until this Season dropped and I saw the bow. I was like ahhhh shit, lol
---
Yep
---
Don't you mean look for a velocity masterwork?
---
You said range
---
I only use recovery and resilience mods
---
Yeah it was like 04:00 when I posted this.
---
My name is byf on youtube and he has animated lore videos shorter 6 minute quck lore videos its all pretty great
---
Its isnt. Due to always having a decent team with my mates
---
Yes
---
I remember yesterday, when I was doing a strike. I got behind and when I was going to get teleported back to my team, I think I slided while I was about to get teleported and I died.
---
OK
---
you mean your Destiny Thesis right :) LOL
---
good luck for the other work :)
---
Range MW my friend.
---
Tower.  Used the Quickness to break out of the map on top of the Anex, and just used a vent up there to force the camera in front of the character model.
---
And you literally tractor cannoned one super and died but #Shaxx doesn't care bb
---
What?
---
I have never felt so betrayed by myself.
---
Maybe ill continue playing destiny as a punishment and run strikes for the trillionth in the last four years.
---
Forge is haunted.
---
Just start a fake clan and have people join it for 1 raid
---
If you have mega shitternet you can glitch it to work.
---
Its free after shadowkeep (New Light)
---
Have you not done a heroic blind well yet? It's fairly common to just find people doing it already, no prep required. Simply mechanics too overall. Grab the buff and shoot the shielded guys.
---
So they could make it larger
---
Use Mountaintop or Prospector for the best results, but basically plant the rally banner, before it places on the ground you kill yourself with a Grenade Launcher.  It will put the rally flag in hilarious places.
---
How do I do that Cus I can make my internet shit
---
Any way to fix it?
---
discount mountain top is op
---
Ah, cheers. Guess I just need to get lucky with the time of day :).
---
Underrated comment
---
Can't I have it in both?

Thanx!! That was fast!

Oh God, Nomu are real.

You did good. I‚Äôm proud of you.

Addictive 1: realize that it‚Äôs not ‚Äúquick‚Äù it‚Äôs a lengthy and hard quest with an amazing reward
---
PC?
---
Let‚Äôs join up
---
Homie you‚Äôre talking outta your ass, the last step is to get to Fabled. I legit helped a dude get to it like 4 days ago
---
Nyoom
---
‚ÄúBruuuuuuuuuh‚Äù
---
Yeah, you can focus your fire on majors and ultras, while the ads just die themselves. Since Tether replenishes grenade energy you can throw them pretty much non stop
---
The ‚ÄúEaster Egg‚Äù
---
All of my alternative options seem to make the cut, I have a play of the game and a through fire and flood, both with Spike nades, both do insane dps. Grenade launcher dps in general on bosses is just top teir, no matter which one you choose, elitist are gonna be elitist.
---
I know. But you do have to put THE HAMMER ( not the trigger ) down after each shot using your hand or thumb. 
---
The guardian clearly isn‚Äôt doing that since after each shot, the hammer is still up, despite the guardian doing something with their hand between each shot
---
my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined
---
Even more amazing when you know we were 2500 miles apart and separated by an ocean when we first met ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
There‚Äôs gonna be a huge uptick in panic supers
---
Literally everything gets the job done. If the power is high enough. One phases, then swarm of the tractor is the highest peak damage. People just think that the best way has to be the only way.
---
What‚Äôs anthem?
---
Trust, last perdition, nature of beast, kindled orchid,
---
The void must‚Äôve whispered for me to come help the death singer then ‚ù§Ô∏èüòÇ
---
Pve or pvp?
---
Pvp
---
Thank you for the info!
---
OEM is pretty average-tier in pve. But only because there's not a whole lot of exotics that really stand out for titans.
---
Perfect timing there.
---
Thank you for the info! I guess I should start playing again lol.
---
I only see one. Wheres the rest of team rocket? And meowth?
---
Claws of wolf, sunshot, fighting lion, oxygen sr3, age old bong, calus mini tool, breath of dragon, bug out bag
---
No
---
Maybe recluse
---
Yeah I got lord of wolves out of my fated engram
---
I like the last perdition pulse rifle from shaxx, recluse smg, kindled orchid, trust, risk runner.
---
NO, we crush them.
---
The issue is that people think it's the ONLY way it has to be. Just like with Cluster Riven, it's not the only way.  
---
Cluster bombs did it.  
---
Swords did it.  
---
Rat king did it.  
---
Telesto did it.  
---
Thunderlord did it.  
---
Two-Tailed Fox did it.  
---
Thousand Voices did it.  
---
It's not about saying there isn't a top method, it's about saying there isn't ONE method. The amount of damage Swarm puts out is ages, head and shoulders, plus a couple KM above what is needed. Prospector can do it. So can Mountain Top, and even with the right team Outrageous Fortune.   
---
Besides, the encounter doesn't even need to be 1 phased. Gigz and his squad did the entire raid without shooting a bullet. They killed Gahlran in like 4 phases with the Fix-Felix middle tree of Solar Titan. Just throwing hammers and then slapping down a bunch of vortexes. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The message I want to send if that you shouldn't be boxed into a certain set up because some asshat says you have to. I don't sweat it if I don't get people with the Tippy top of the mountain guns. Doesn't matter if you communicate and play well. Swarm has been good for ages upon ages. After the grenade launchers buff I already knew about Raven and Prospector and shit before they became meta. However, they never were and still aren't a NECESSITY like some people make them out to be. I want to show people that they aren't pigeon held into a certain play style or loadout.   
---
That's why I called it a 'Gjallarhorn-esque meta.' It's slowly getting to that point where people won't pick you up if you don't have the gun they want. Just like with Gjallarhorn though, it isn't an absolute. These kinds of meta loadouts just end up stagnating the endgame and ruining raiding for a lot of people.
---
Or some Minecraft Crucible map idea with a crude shaxx yelling all the time...
---
Waking Vigil or NF
---
I think i may try to get another outlast (same rmp as claws of the wolf) in place of a claws of the wolf
---
Couple more spins and that battery can charge the forge on its own.
---
Alright I‚Äôm probably going to be downvoted to hell for this but anyway 
---
I don‚Äôt think OEM is cheap I just think vengeance is a bit too much. It‚Äôs definitely not the only exotic that tracks enemy targets and grating an overshield for a kill on the marked target is a decent exotic bonus. The extra damage and high overshield needs to be pulled back a bit but I don‚Äôt think using OEM itself is over powered or cheap. Nobody complains about Antaeus wards because they actually require a decent amount of skill but anyone that can use them actually has more of an advantage then someone who uses OEM
---
LoW is super cheap to use because it‚Äôs super easy and way to effective
---
That's a sleek looking titan
---
I hate how accurate this is
---
So me and my friend were making stupid logos and it hit him that the UUUU is the basic structure of the destiny logo, metaphysically meaning that Baneposting did help create this game.
---
I've been waiting all year it's about time
---
My friend is already a Warlock so I wanted to be something different
---
What is Warlock?
---
Good one, let me know how your Recluse worked for you at 50 meters.
---
complete with the little "bling" 
---
I even read it in Meowth's voice.
---
Is that a raid banner in the distant sky at the end?
---
If anyone ever asks me what Destiny is about, I'm just going to show them this
---
Ok so you‚Äôve never done heroic if you think a barrier will literally do anything to stop a cyclops blast
---
All crucible plans are now out the window
---
Bungo bringing in Mr. Toots
---
I under stand now
---
I‚Äôll finally be able to get the last word lmfao.
---
Cloak is last season's eververse, gloves are last season's iron banner
---
September 17
---
Is this on PC? I would love to do some destiny themed Minecraft
---
Haven't married her yet, but hopefully soon :)
---
If all of your friends are on xbox then join them. Might have a lot more fun playing with people you know. Can always keep playing on pc to gather exotics and what not then xfer over to xbox when shadowkeep goes live. Unelss of course you already have an xbox d2 account. Then no need to do anything.
---
I play on pc and love it, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to switch back to console only because of the frame rate differences but if you don‚Äôt have a 144 Hz monitor I think you should stay on Xbox with your friends because overall it won‚Äôt be fun without them
---
Yeah I‚Äôm currently on xbox and was thinking of switching to pc when shadowkeep dropped. Thank you
---
Good.
---
I mean, that's not putting people in a situation to be helpful. That's you complaining about a game on a sub full of folks who love the game. Considering this is the internet, I am not sure what you expected lol
---
And yes, you asked for opinions. But you loaded your question with your own negative opinion, which doesn't help folks have a healthy discussion.
---
Sure buddy
---
Looks more like a Suros to me.
---
1. Dusk

2. Winter

This we all can agree on fortnite kids will get bagged

I sniped myself with an Arc Staff deflection once. Not even actually blocking either, the brief second it blocks while popping the Super.
---
By the other two...
---
Ok sure expect to see it in the next few hours
---
I‚Äôm still making progress towards it. Just stuck at this part.
---
That's actually a really clever name I like thatüòÇ
---
I‚Äôm still making progress towards it. I‚Äôm just stuck at this part
---
Just buy jerky from a store near you
---
Thank you
---
Haha i got it from a random drop yesterday so it‚Äôs all good now haha
---
you still up for helping? got 1 guy just need 1 more
---
I have the same problem, you are not a lone
---
I don't understand. How is this misleading
---
How?
---
Another cabal invasion?
---
2 schools of thought here
---
It might be a bug, because baroque came out well after the storm catalyst did
---
Or it might be purposeful, since baroque technically isn‚Äôt drang, even though it has the sturm synergy perk
---
I keep on getting stuck at a loading screen going up those stairs leading to the courtyard, had some people take a selfie with my floating hunter.
---
Boo! House of Dusk sucks!
---
It‚Äôs a reference to the marketing tactic known as ‚Äúhunt the truth‚Äù which turned out to be a lie
---
The only difference (from what I can tell) is Mountaintop has more velocity and a better trajectory. They‚Äôre both 90 rpm gl‚Äôs with spike grenade. Yes, the better velocity makes a difference dps-wise for bosses, but in casual play I don‚Äôt think that matters? That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs the ‚Äúpoor man‚Äôs mountaintop‚Äù...
---
1 dusk 2exile? i dont remember  3 kings 4 devils 5 judgement 6 winter 7 wolves
---
Well that dude is just a dumbass, it would be hilarious for destiny to be self aware
---
\*cries in warlock the supreme master race excpet for huntrs still being the strongest class
---
I want the recluse (mainly because I keep getting wrecked by it) but at the same time I can't stand competitive. And I feel like by the time I would finally get it it'd get nerfed anyways.
---
Is there even a banner for House Light?
---
hunter is the easy way to go because its op easy to use and doesnt have a single bad subclass tree
---
I‚Äôve also found that and I truly don‚Äôt understand why people still stand by Full Choke so strongly still.
---
same
---
~Spicy~
---
Sorry, went and checked and could use some help
---
&gt;but in casual play I don‚Äôt think that matters?
---
I guess it depends if you are casually DPSing a boss (strikes, etc.) or not-casually DPSing a boss (raids). 
---
[A DPS spreadsheet that shows many other items above Militia's but below Mountaintop.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/12vF7ckMzN4hex-Tse4HPiVs_d9huFOKlvUoq5V41nxU/htmlview?usp=sharing&amp;sle=true#) Look in the rightmost column for numbers that are not for raid bosses.
---
I think the terrible rap made it that much more cursed.
---
Loved it 5/7
---
VoG or Crota‚Äôs End.
---
I believe you could only get it in Joker‚Äôs Wild
---
That‚Äôs on titan
---
No, you don't leave there personal information anywhere on Reddit.
---
It's witch-hunting, and it's severely against the rules.
---
Doing so will result in your being permanently banned.
---
Report them in-game and just move on.
---
Sorry what is that
---
Probably either Opening Shot, Rampage, Full Bore, Accurized, or something with Explosive Rounds.
---
I've spent like an hour doing this too! Theres one in the edz, it's in the building on the left of the church. So many shanks..
---
[removed]
---
Oh, man. You right, I thought it was just.the triumph. Damn
---
Can't get there from here!
---
Destiny is going free to play ?
---
!remind me September 16
---
No worries about me, enjoy using your thorn! I am not in a rush to get mine
---
The base game(all year 1 content) is being made free to play.
---
I mean kinda
---
Osiris and Warmind have been free for a while now.
---
Level 30 is the cap for Warmind.
---
To get to a higher level, you‚Äôll need Forsaken.
---
I did it only because I knew it‚Äôs importance in pve content, and I don‚Äôt regret it
---
Yes,but they made them a fairly rare drop
---
Some call me....tim
---
Yeah but don‚Äôt you see the strategy there? 
---
It‚Äôs to get people who haven‚Äôt played it sucked in to it finish all year one content and then will want more with the year two and whatever else is hid behind a paywall now essentially 
---
Fortunately I own all the dlc so for me it will all be free come September but also for me gears 5 will be put so destiny may take a back seat lol 
---
Depends what way you look at it... free or a sneaky way to sell more to players who haven‚Äôt played
---
True. Hanger needs something. I like the idea of the annex too, but just feel they did the "low-key" aspect of it too well, to the point where even I have to take a second finding them.
---
*A million deaths are not enough for Master Rahool*
---
It's not bad, the special perk is useful in comp but other snipers like bite of the fox and supremacy feel faster and they also stick to heads better.

!remindme September 16

Too bad we never landed on the moon. The Chili Peppers said it best, space maybe the final frontier but it's made in a Hollywood basement. Operation Fishbowl is another fun one.
---
Don‚Äôt know what that means... but it‚Äôs beautiful and I appreciate however long that took to make
---
Imagine being a fresh dreg out in your first deployment, a guardian appears and walks towards the cave that you and your 4 army buddies are sharing. He fires one shot from a hand cannon and instantly kills your bud steve dreg. Steve's corpse then explodes violently killing your other three friends in a flash. 
---
and there you are... shitting yourself.
---
My advice only do three comp games a week
---
Waht?
---
I done that same mistake on Xbox. 
---
I purchased the pass thinking it would come with Forsaken.. I was wrong. 
---
I had to fill out a refund form online for the annual pass to get my money back and then I just purchased the Legendary edition
---
The best part of that is one person screaming NOOOO and you just laughing lmao
---
Can't say I have the same problem. Having to go talk to Ada before every forge was a "helpful" reminder as to where she was. Drifter was difficult to get used to, but the new spawn point and the loyalty packages i got from him, as well as all the gambit/gambit prime bounties helped. As a solo player I never did any raids, so the bot's spot was of no concern to me, so him moving had no impact on me.
---
I would like to see more game modes especially that old capture the flag mode. I also would like to see less supers personally. I know some people disagree with this I just prefer the gunplay and neutral games. I think in order to keep people interested after pinnacle weapons would be some really cool cosmetic items that are rewarded for tim spent in ranked rather than achieving a certain rank. Also enhanced perks on a competitive specific armor set would be cool.
---
Damn, again! Can I fight my anxiety or obesity sometimes!?
---
Happened to me at the same cave. Other players started showing up and we just kept slaughtering them as they emerged from the cave, they just kept spawning for like five minutes.
---
If you walk up (not jump) you can emote while Frozen and pull out your ghost to freeze the pose. I did t with the mirror emote and just stood their pointing at anyone going up the stairs.
---
wish i had friends like you  :)
---
Yeah mine dropped from that as well
---
I got this the other day and I was excited at first . . . then I read it‚Äôs intrinsic perk
---
*still don‚Äôt have Shards*
---
I like this plan
---
Same. I guess I just really want a market/barrage area. Where different types of vendors are found with unique designs to there shops. Would be an awesome idea for third party weapon and armor vendors like Suros, Hakke, Omolon, and etc.
---
Those were the glory days.
---
I think I‚Äôve been r/whoosh üòÇ
---
I definitely agree.  The RNG system would be slightly more bearable if it wasn't obviously tweaked to keep you logging hours and chasing a carrot on a stick.  They've split with Activision yet Season of Opulence seems just as manipulative and aimed at monopolizing 100% of your gaming time.
---
Just started this week. A little solo queue and a little with one of my friends. Mainly during the 3 matches a week but need to do more but I'm not brave enough to solo queue after the 3 games a week.
---
Crota‚Äôs End
---
Shoot a rocket at it
---
Worked! Tnx!
---
Np
---
Maybe if you run some Last Wish and get bottom of the scoreboard consistently it'll drop.  Aim for most deaths and least damage, seems to do the trick!
---
Been playing since launch and I‚Äôve just never seen this here, managed to get most of the black armour hand cannon quest in like 3 minutes XD
---
&gt;When you‚Äôre receiving an Exotic, we will take into account all Exotics you‚Äôve found, and weight them against Exotics you have yet to acquire; this lowers the chances of receiving Exotics you already own  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Exotics that you do not yet own will be individually weighted much higher than duplicate Exotics.  
---
&gt;When receiving duplicate Exotics, you will be more likely to earn armor pieces, as they have randomly rolled perks
---
Of course they don't give us quantitative descriptions, because they're Bungie, but that would imply fairly significant protection against duplicates.  
---
What they need is an additional layer of "bad luck prevention".  I.E. if your past 10 exotics have been dupes then cut a guardian a fucking break already.  
---
This is exceptionally frustrating as a PvP player when the the new exotics are top tier meta items.
---
sometimes the game takes a long long time to load, it might be a good idea to just exit the search and re search
---
You assume I have a relationship...
---
Or friends...
---
Nobody‚Äôs disagreeing with you though?
---
‚ÄúStill no 1K voices‚Äù is the last panel.
---
You said that Erentil isn‚Äôt a problem because of Recluse.
---
I think you meant to respond to the other dude. I‚Äôm on your side lol. About 16 exotics before I got Kepri‚Äôs Sting this Season
---
i never thought to stick the tether on the roof. thanks for that
---
Yeah so my warlock is Asian (male) and my hunter is awoken (female) so technically I could be reincarnated as either of them... sounds like fun, either I can fucking jump around everywhere or I can be gey and float around so idk if it‚Äôs a win win? Or a win, lose?
---
Omnigul is still single!
---
Thats monochromatic. I ise it on my titan.
---
Warlock (Asian male human) and hunter (awoken female)
---
Nice heads up play! Good job
---
No I mean irl
---
Im litteraly level capped 30 power like 310 something and havent seen a single bow
---
Ah whoops, I tacked that on to support what you were saying.  Didn't mean for it to come across as countering your point haha.  Now we have 2 data points for a 90%+ dupe rate.
---
Moons haunted
---
You can't get bows until Forsaken. That might be why.
---
FUSION GANG
---
Ahhhh white male... lmao I‚Äôm dumb af
---
I said FOR ME. Doesn‚Äôt mean it isn‚Äôt problem for others lol
---
Yea i want the dlc but cant afford it lmao
---
Ahhh! In that case, given human lifespan during the golden age, you certainly could have moved to a different region and then developed characteristics of that region over your 300 years.
---
Nah bro, it‚Äôs the sword logic
---
whats that on your hip?
---
But Fusion Rifles are a Recluse counter, not the other way around, anyone playing smart with a Fusion won‚Äôt let get close. Especially with Backup Plan.
---
Nah, she said she was too caught up in her career, and she said she was seeing someone tentatively
---
Damn. Lots of butthurt last word users here
---
Another one of moira‚Äôs memes taken to reddit
