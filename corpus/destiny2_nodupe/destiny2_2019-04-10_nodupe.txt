An ARC Lance super would be pretty cool I guess. Not too dissimilar to dawnblade though.

---
---
Why do you save notorious engrams?
---
YOUR ALMOST THERE YOU CAN DO IT!!
---
Now that I think about it, probably closer to 15 seconds
---
doing the walking part on the starts made me almost buy the 3k silver to skip it
---
It's not new, it's just DFA with a longer barrel.
---
Even if you already completed it during Festival of the Lost? I'd like to go back..
---
My week is ruined
---
I blame halo for teabaggers and showboaters.
---
F
---
That's why i think it's both
---
Someone should have told you about the Penumbra GSM ;)
---
can it drop when the "Powerful Gear" is not showing?
---
Go to the tower then orbit then tower. Or switch characters and switch back. This seems to work for most people
---
Nope, 3 chances a week
---
Okay, fucking Titan whips out an arc lance fate style. Charging forward before releasing a massive lightning bolt from where the lance landed.
---
It requires about as much time to remake D1 areas as it does to make new areas. So would you (and the rest of the community) prefer new or old areas? Can’t have both
---
I've heard the rumours, but considering it can't take mods and it isn't void, I would say it isn't as efficient when under actual DPS conditions. Similar to how 1KV (which has the highest DPS against Riven when unbuffed) got shit on by my Transit during the tests.
---

---
But hey, you never know until you test it right? I'll be right on it.
---
The app doesn’t show what shader or orniment is on the weapon
---
I was able to grab mine right before they pulled all pinnacle weapons. Unfortunately I have potato aim and can't kill shit with it.
---
You may already know, I ask just on the off chance that you don't because it's worked so well for me and my friends. Have you tried out the built-in LFG tool on xbox?
---
Awesome dude. Thanks for the info.
---
VENUS BABY!
---
You bet. Good luck!
---
That actually makes a lot of sense, still a but of a bummer/tease for the players who got a neat new exotic, and now have to wait to use it.
---
This isn't an LFG sub.
---
Rule 13.
---
/r/Fireteams
---
Remove this i am offended
---
It's a bug. Bungie made a post about it in their forums.
---
Before reset i was still in game and went into the tower. Visting Tess, there were three pages for her and on the second there was this ghost and two armor pieces for the Reverly event. I then closed my game and the it updated and upon returning to Tess she no longer had 3 pages and had what everyone sees now.
---
LMFAO!  So Trueeeeeeee!!!!!
---
You're gonna hafta sit tight for awhile on that Recluse.
---
Bungie removed the ability to claim it from Shaxx until the exploit gets fixed.
---
its 70 bucks on live right now
---
Not correct. I and many others enjoy comp. More balanced games more challenge and the wins feel meaningful. Do you even lift?
---
[Your feeling is correct. Sorry Guardian.](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/bbanpz/amp_it_up_guardians_here_is_your_weekly_reset_for/)
---
Cause Bungie is aware of spectral blades
---
I feel like a good system would be what ornament tokens kinda were in D1: We collect a piece of legendary gear (wouldn't be able to change how exotics look) and if we dismantle it, we get a transmog token of that piece of gear. It still makes chasing gear a thing, so sets don't become worthless after looting one. This sounds so perfect in my mind.
---
You won't get it with that attitude unless you pay for it. If you hate crucible you are unlikely to be good enough to get it.
---
I thought it was just pinnacle weapons from the drifter. Did I miss something?
---
Let me join you, brother..
---
Please teach me how to do this.
---
It's primarily due to having exclusivity rights with Sony. They've always had PS4 exclusives. I think that contract is now expired or soon to be so, who knows what they'll do in the future. PC has/always been a middle ground between the console wars so we'll see lol
---
Literally every match I played last night.
---
I don’t think Luna’s needs a nerf, more like an adjustment to 180’s tbh.
---
Considering that Service Revolver can have the same TTK and a much better range then Luna...I don't think Luna needs a nerf, at all.
---
Especially because Luna doesn't make someone into a better player. Played against a lot of Luna players while getting my own this season and only a handfull were actually good with it.
---
Then, there are weapons like Recluse which are just as strong, if not stronger in specific ranges.
---
Recluse, for example doesn't even need to hit Crits. to do the max. amount of damage and you don't even need a kill with the weapon itself to proc. the damage boost...
---
Luna is definitly one of the strongest PvP weapons. But only good people will be able to use it properly while there are still weapons out there that can compete with it.
---
Stay at xur and wait for reset.
---
Buy Fated Engram
---
Profit?
---
YO DAWG I HEARD YOU LIKE EXPLOSIONS
---
You sir have the life attitude of a winner.
---
Outlaw isn't terrible, but you're right about needing range to compete.  I snagged one with steadyhand HCS, ricochet rounds, rapid hit and kill clip with a range MW.  It's a pretty good contender.
---
And all for Zavala's low price of 1500 vanguard tokens.  Thankfully he threw in enough crap-ass rolled main ingredient and nameless midnight to equip a small army!
---
Man, that was my favorite gun back in the day.
---
No
---
Can you farm for me Monarque/jutton with all 7 or can you only do it with the 2 powerfuls?
---
Solid vid.  Nice and snappy editing.

I miss my superblack shader :(

I miss my new monarchy shaders ;(

Only forsaken.

You can’t change post titles only reddit admins can.

The power of the mighty Fighting Lion.
---
Nope it’s really not. You are not a true raider if you cheese. It take no effort and it takes almost the some time.
---
I didn't even know there was a glitch
---
Seems you somehow forgot the 165% damage buff from last month? Fucking morons. A nerf doesn’t instantly make everything unusable
---
Which fusion is that you're using?
---
it also improves recoil direction unless it's been changed since it was added to the API
---
Well I guess thanks for the input being more constructive then just Insults. Gg to that. As stated above I don’t have a pc. I have never played a game past 60fps. So yeah. I’m ignorant to it all.
---
Thanks my man! M
---
Take my money!!
---
He didn't have to say it like that but he's not wrong the thing is still great. I didn't even realize it was nerfed.
---
shit I still havent even attempted that raid, or the other new one... I need a better clan.
---
Now we wait and see who gets yoinked in their sign out time
---
It’s in the lore, guardians aren’t bound to their supers they can just channel the light into whatever, Shin Malphur says this about the drifter “he’s freed himself of any type of classification, he’s not a hunter, not a warlock, and not a Titan” that’s why when ikora forces open the infinite Forrest, it kinda makes sense.
---
No, this was an exploit people used to get thousands of free enhancement cores
---
Oh. I would've kept it, doesn't hurt to have more than one. Plus it may have had better stats than that other Dragonfly Tatara (I'm assuming it's another Tatara since you didn't specify)
---
prime evil = diablo "top tier evil"
---
primeval = destiny  "ancient"
---
I get you. For me it has been a game that if i leave for a while, when i come back, i have fun everytime. And the only moments I've stopped has been because of burnout, but i seem to always come back lol
---
Dude I’m the same with the dreadnaught,  Nothing will ever, EVER be as good as the dreadnaught to me, it’s probably because I have good memories of playing the game with my friend and farming court of oryx, also i loved all the little secrets that were hidden in there.
---
I've done one out of three solo, and the majority of the other two solo. It's easier this season too. Definitely possible but very frustrating at times.
---
Cursed image
---
Bungo is preventing anyone from picking up season 6 pinnacle weapons due to the ability to pick up am infinite amount of them and dismantling them for 7 enhancement cores each. They unfortunately working on a fix for that and not for enhancement cores themselves
---
When the full set invader has invaded twice already and insta dies
---
Woah man no one told me it was 2012
---
It’s weird I found this post because I was just thinking about the same topic, I’ve played my fair share of crucible and have had a lot of fun with it for the most part, comp? Never, never had any fun, played more then a handful of comp games and it’s disgusting, not even blaming players, just certain weapons are meta, in a game with so many guns how could 3 be like the only thing to use, and then there balancing and 4 stacks and it’s just so toxic and annoying, maybe why they got rid of trials to, plus PvP holds pve back in a sense, in PvE all chains are off, you don’t need to balance any weapons really (unless like cheese and stuff) and it would bring the community together, with the announcement or borderlands 3 I’ve been playing that more, it’s 99% PvE besides like one on one deals that mean nothing, and it’s just so refreshing to all be on the same page as players and not really have any complaints or sweaty stuff and there’s fun matchmaking since it’s all PvE even match making for end game content, it’s just sweet, and they can make any kind of crazy ass gun they want cuz it’ll never piss off players, destiny really can’t do that unless they wanna balance it for PvP, a rocket launcher that creates giant nukes? Unlimited magazines? Etc
---
DING!!!!
---
IMO Kill clip and rampage is better one SMG, I don't know if you can have both.
---
That's the one Y1 helmet I want the most. I did new monarchy on my warlock three faction rallies in a row in vanilla destiny 2, I even got the max amount of items you could get in a faction rally twice, where opening an engram would just give you shaders. My rng sucked.
---
tbh true. Its annoying how good pvp players have advantage of getting pvp and pve pinnacle weapons, while the bad players only pve
---
This!! 100 times this. I literally joined a clan that I know the leader personally (Like face to face). He s like a comp God and even then his clan is dry. I got to play with them only a handful of times..granted; I did jump on the bandwagon a lil late but I would at least think the clan would be more active..(especially since everytime I go to his house; He s online 😑)
---
It was removed from the loot pool, you can still grab it from collections though
---
r/killedbythearchitects
---
Why is this a common trend? So many people get walled at the end of heroic III, myself included. Feels bad.
---
I hope is not the man-eating grass. It was my best friend
---
Haha yea, I had to restart my console odly enough for it to appear in my inventory :)
---
Still didn't get my ghost.
---
But another new guy in my clan did. So. Cool.
---
It's arc week dude, they buffed it /s
---
Is it that hard to get the recluse? I solo qued to fabled within the first 2 weeks
---
I'll accept being less cool if it means I can finally get the damn gun. This week will be my 45th attempt, here's hoping.
---
This would work. Have people be rewarded for being good but have PVE trash like me have a slight chance if willing to put in the time for a more lengthy but doable quest.   
---
The negative would be that there are always players that want special gear to show off skill. Its why trials of the nine where so popular.
---
hey dude, you need some orbs?
---
Basically, these ornaments in particular were seasonally-bound, and were unlocked via completing certain tasks for your chosen faction during Faction Rallies. Bungo operates on a ‘one and done’ deal with these kinda things - once the season is over, the items from these special events *never* come back, until maybe the final throes of the game before the sequel comes out as a celebration. This is also the same with events like Festival of the Lost, Iron Banner, The Dawning and likely the upcoming Revelry. 
---
The only reason I believe they are willing to reintroduce old stuff to Tess’ stock is to drain newer players of Bright Dust they may be accumulating tbh - though maybe I’m slightly jaded because they removed the Prismatic Matrix lmao.
---
Happy arc week
---
Tolan Dark will be what we need to defeat Savathun

I think lunas is pretty fair honestly.
---
I'm still trying to get it 😣
---
Ada finally gave me the thing i wanted
---
Yeetun
---
It took 42 frames and this change
---
Just reading it gave me some ideas,maybe subclass specific assassinations if you melee someone at kill range
---
Arcstaff: punches you a few times then summons the staff and slaps you across the face
---
Striker: punches you so hard it sends you flying
---
Stormtrance: Shocks you several times and then calls lightning on you
---
Combination blow affect the super aswell ... So if you have Combination blow x3 and you super : you can shred everything
---
I used Supremacy, Last Perdition/Recluse, Anarchy. Ot worked out pretty well.

The Wardcliff Coil i’ve been grinding and grinding and trying my luck in every single thing but cant get it whatsoever even now they nerfed it but i want it so bad
---
I was so mad at myself when I saw the exploit. I saw it real early,maybe an hour after reset. Got excited but forgot I had jus turned in the gambit quest I had on my warlock (which was the last character I had it on) the day before.
---
It sure does, that’s probably what they were going for with bottom tree being for bosses, mid tree for ads/boss/pvp and top being ad/pvp
---
No it got a 25% nerf based on the 125% increase. So it's quite a bit more.
---
England's my favorite city
---
To put it on perspective I think of myself as a pretty good crucible player. First day I had Luna, I had almost 800 pvp kills on it. I went and did a friends luna quest grind for him (he's not very good) and he's had it for a whole season and has around 300 on it. Guns don't make players. Players make players. (keep in mind this is console ps4)
---
Im down for helping people grind too, my gamer tag is Spartan Jager.
---
Didn't even mean to find it, and there are easy to kills so it's not like it's needed , but if your feeling lazy
---
Started making constructs in the neighbourhood

Finally

Whats that emblem? And how do you get it?
---
I think you need to get off your high horse there buddy and back the community for better QoL
---
Upvote because no spectral blade
---
Because that's the spot that specifically the people going for 2100 get stuck usually between 1700-2200. And since luna has been out since season 4, that's where you hit a wall of em
---
You got this
---
Feels bad (I heard about it when they announced they were fixing it )
---
All they needed to do was recycle the Titan hammers animations mixed with the valkyrie throw. Would be so cool. I don't like that we only have one ranged subclass.
---
I'm on pc, and I wouldn't mind helping out
---
I got in 1 Vex Crossroads, but Vance got scared
---
Very nice, I do some 3d printing myself. Next time I would recommend putting one more layer as you can kinda see through it. Wouldn't want it to break after all.

I'm on PC and I feel the same way. Just want to find a good group of people that I can play with/learn from. My whole clan is all PVE so I only solo que
---
D1 was just a better game.
---
it's just so weird. Because in my experience, every game I've played has super toxic people in comp modes but chill people in qp. But in destiny it's the exact opposite. I've had so many matches in comp where we get curb stomped in the first few minutes or rounds and then my entire team leaves. So, instead of fighting it and getting tilted I just start sitting when I spawn until they all start sitting with me and it works like 90% of the time. I've tried that in qp but instead they just KDA farm me.
---
Lol I've never had a problem with them and neither has my clan mates
---
TL;DR: PvP players deserve a better product than what is offered and I babble on my thoughts to help it. 
---
Here is my take on this:
---
0. No PvP is better than bad PvP. If it's not well implemented and supported it is not worth having. 
---
1. PvP players should have a more polished product than what is currently available. PvE players would not accept if they were handled the same way. Imagine if Bungie just canceled raids? Said the couldn't make them work so until further notice they are canceled. Including the ones that were already out. That's what happened with Trials.
---
2. I think comp should have tighter skill based match making. This is COMPETITIVE, you should be full try hard here. That said it should also be much more rewarding. 
---
3. QP should have a completely separate ranking for its match making. If you don't want to try hard you will be placed accordingly with others like you or people actually at that skill level. If you want to pull that win out and go full try hard that game it won't affect your mmr straight away. Eventually if you do it enough it will though. That way people who are truly at that level can try hard and having meaningful impact but the people who want to chill can still do that. But it doesn't affect your comp rank and vice versa. 
---
4. Network issues. Just needs fixing, nothing fancy here.
---
5. Fixing the meta. Balance changes can be complicated since it also impacts PvE. But a few other things can help influence it such as map design. I hear all the time on how we need more large maps. Changing how heavy ammo spawns and super meter generation work could also influence it.
---
All that being said and we are mostly in the dark on what's coming up with PvP in general. Maybe that's good so the devs can do their thing and not worry about what Reddit thinks. But if PvP is on the back burner it needs to be looked at from the big picture. Can Bungie properly support PvP with its current resources? If not can they feasibly bring on the staff and overheard to do it? Do they have an idea of where they want PvP to be? I personally believe Bungie could make Crucible and PvP in general a great experience. I don't think they have the resources to do it right now though. We might see something in year 3 but for this year I only see balance changes to weapons, supers, and subclasses like we have been. No big overhauls of the system in general.
---
There is probably a bunch of them, but the only one i know of is the one MyNameIsByf advertises on his YT. https://discordapp.com/invite/s8dwrmz
---
Are you trying to insult people calling them "tryhards"?
---
"We are aware of spectral blades"
---
Reading TWAB and patch notes is for plebs, am I right?
---
Great gun
---
*laughs in vigil of heroes*
---
Why would you scream?
---
Have your 1k (pun intended).
---
Do it bro. Load a couple different element snipers (or Borealis) and follow any of the walkthroughs for them. It takes like... 20 minutes.
---
I hope its on Mars
---
You legend- thanks so much for this!!!
---
Is The server  any good?
---
Ok, welcome to the common player base, where millions of players have 700, because in this game it is not something special.
---
I dont know im a playstation user so i dont use discord.
---
why the hell are you guys here lol
---
As a lover of pvp I don't like this trophy weapon crap, give them emblems and ornaments and cool looking armor sure but winning is its own reward, and I also don't want to hear pve players bitching about pvp that they don't enjoy at all and only play for the rewards
---
Ok dude, for you maybe it's not a big deal, but like I said before, to me it is. 
---
Not everybody has the same goals, so thanks for underrate others achievements.
---
First in the neighbourhood.
---
Jotuns and Lemons have the highest drop rate, no reason to post them.
---
The reward for skill is winning
---
You are welcome, "dude."
---
yeah its an exaggeration, but you need them for a lot of things which leads to using around 20 or more weekly
---
&gt;&gt; So because a small sect of the destiny community have plenty, everyone else should just stop complaining and deal with it
---
No. But many in the community should learn to manage resources instead of infusing a piece of gear for 3 power levels.
---
There’s a handful of already masterworked weapons available from quests and triumphs. Good weapons too.
---
If you don’t like them, then just masterwork your favorite **if it is a god roll**.
---
But if you infuse every item and masterwork any minor upgrade, then you have no room to complain.
---
so I dont have to get the legendary collection to get Osirius and warmind?
---
just because activision isn't publishing their game anymore doesn't mean they're exempt from any exclusivity deal that was signed
---
Check the in game video settings and see how much of your GPU is being used. That may point you in the right direction at least!
---
thanks for helping nonetheless
---
I love going through the campaign on alts in all games, it’s like playing the game all over again.
---
with only 14 defeated opponents??
---
Oh I loved crucible until every tom DICK and harry got a LH or and NF and then it wasn't fun anymore.  I still do Iron Banner too and I like that but I don't do regular quick play. Every once in awhile I get an itch to do comp so I will do a round of that but I just stick to gambit because I love gambit.
---
Now I’m tempted to see what the maximum is...
---
You just triggered my PTSD from being swarmed by yellow jackets. Fuck.
---
Just buff other guns to be more competitive so not everyone and their mother run duskrock blues + Luna/NF +wardcliff coil/colony....
---
sause captain?
---
Lmao yeah
---
I stoped using the invader set because other invaders would get mad at me for invading :/
---
To me it seems like Trust with the ornament
---
What thread was that? Lol
---
First ever run of gauntlet I somehow missed the info about punching the psions. Only messed up 2 tries before I caught on... but that was my reaction when I did
---
You really are one majorly pissed off individual, aren’t you? The most knowledgeable people generally are *not* the Crucible players - they’re the ones finding the PvE speedrun strategies, exploits, etc; anyone with two brain cells to rub together can read patch notes and realize just how outrageously powerful things can be and/or just how badly something will get hit because of a nerf. Want an example of Bungo over buffing something and then having to tone it back? Wardcliff. Want an example of nerfing a PvE perk into the ground? Box Breathing. Want an example of how they could potentially balance Spectral Blades + Gwisin while making it more viable in PvE? Reduce light attack lunge range to pre buff distance and change Gwisin so that it only activates after 3 rapid kills, but make Gwisin restore more super (give it a return rate similar to Titan’s Code of the Juggernaut).
---
Bungie’s nerfs and buffs generally take things and make them either ridiculously powerful or ridiculously useless.
---
Chaperone is one of my favorite guns. Don't even have it yet. Sick clip.
---
And I think match making is broken. Plenty of times I’d have a two or three win streak, and then queue in with no one on my team or even missing a player. That makes it tough against anyone running with Luna’s or other metas and even tougher against a 4 stack.
---
well, that's just destiny for you. Expensive af, wait for the sale.
---
Oh I read about that earlier, hopefully they fix it soon because it's fun to use in pvp and pve.  I was tearing through ads in Gambit with it yesterday.
---
Good advice.  I think it probably would be easier with my Titan than my Hunter that I used for recluse and Luna's.
---
how do you claim unlimited coppies of a pinnacle weapon?
---
But it can be waist of a nade. I loved zhalo hope they would bring it back
---
Thanks man
---
Just after this game I landed 177,236 Damage with only 21 kills 😂
---
Try landing a headshot with bottom tree goldie and CN, that’ll kill anything!
---
Im not spreading information just wasn't sure if it was a thing or if i was just getting lucky. Thanks for clearing that up for me.
---
Yikes D:
---
I'd like to think if we keep making these posts they'll finally give us something that doesn't completely break all metas or at least something to usher a new one in but I am sure we'll see another exotic hand canon sometime soon.
---
Exposition bot what is this? Ghost bullying post?
---
There is definitely a lot frustrating things about comp. I’m at 3.3k rn solo queueing and it’s so frustrating being put with clueless teammates and against 4 stacks of one eyed mask and gwism vest. Together with the occasional bungie errors that stop your win streak and even just give you a random loss.
---
Titanposting with a quick jab at Ghost
---
Lol whatever buddy, if y’all would use your heads y’all wouldn’t have problems with cores, simple as that 🤷‍♀️
---
There’s so much more problems that need to be fixed in this game but y’all stay complaining about a infusion system that doesn’t need fixing lol
---
That’s really helps a lot for me I think. I’m a pretty casual player and don’t often play competitive until recently when I made up my mind to go for recluse and when I was working for Thorn. I would have it after this coming Tuesday’s reset thanks to the glory bonus, but until they fix the bug I’m stuck. 
---
I have found that playing competitive has altered my play style and help me grow as a player though. I’ve enjoyed being beaten (sometimes) as much as I’ve enjoyed winning because I can take things away and tweak my loadouts or whatever. It’s also helped me a lot with my decision making. By no means am I a great PvP player, but I’ve definitely gotten better.
---
Now... back to @ashcammm...
---
I was in a levi raid, near the end one person keeps forgetting to call out the symbol on the forehead. We kept on wiping, I was so frustrated. 
---
Turned out he wasn't shouting loud enough for discord to pick up
---
Get axes, I'lol get cup
---
Now I wonder if ghost are punch-proof.
---
TBF I am an Arc main because I love that uppercut melee move way too much.
---
But this top in Gambit with spectral is basically infinite super as long as you backflip your way through every enemy
---
What part are you at?
---
I'm not saying it's the optimal DPS build for PVE, I'm just saying it's pretty good and fun to play.
---
I mean, there are heaps of things I could have done for more DPS. Melting Point + Trench Barrel, Winter's Guile + Attunement of Hunger, Slowva + SoDA... just pointing this out since this is where the changes have been made most recently.
---
Vuvuzela? is that you?
---
All part of getting better dude, keep playing and you’ll be better in no time
---
Since Tatara is a high impact sniper, kill clip gives enough bonus damage that you can 1 shot to the body in PvP with kill clip active.
---
GIVE ZHALO
---
Ah sorry man, forgot you were supreme leader.
---
*shouts* you hear that guys? We’re not allowed to have opinions or complain or give feedback because supreme leader adrian over here said so.
---
I apologise supreme leader
---
Roughly 83 percent of the time
---
That gun was my first exotic drop, and it used it ever since.
---
And then I got truth and gjallarhorn. It was a good time
---
It's why I love being a Titan.
---
If this ornament doesn’t get put in the game I will be slightly dissapointed
---
god now I can't unsee it.
---
Keep making jokes buddy lol, you know I’m right :)
---
We already have Emotes who are basically hyped dance moves or memes. So why not doing the same with ornaments. That would be fun!
---
Nice
---
Some things are easier to fix than others. Preventing people from picking up pinnacle guns was probably a matter of flipping a switch
---
I don’t like applying shaders to individual pieces, I preferred that one shader for armer system back in d1. I do like how you can apply shaders to guns in d2 tho, they did that right
---
Just going to say the same thing!
---
Ok thanks, would you say headseeker and rampage is a good bygones role?
---
The worst is when you get tethered and the wizards spawn in, its like an instant wipe
---
I've got it set as my lock screen on my Galaxy Note 9.
---
This nerf won't matter in the slightest when your entire team is running Wardcliff and pumping rounds into Oryx's face in The Reckoning.
---
I think this nerf was so you couldn't just insta kill Nokris in Strange Terrain.
---
If my luck would allow me MC, I probably wouldn't complain as much.
---
Service Revolver probably is good, but the chances of getting a god roll. Watched a vid, the chances of it rolling Outlaw or Rangefinder and Kill Clip with a Range Masterwork: 1/13,000.
---
I've got Spare Rations, but it rolled Threat Detector with Multi-Kill Clip. It rolled a handling Masterwork, which is just great considering the literal description of the frame is "superb handling." I'd honestly prefer MC sill, even though this can drop with random rolls.
---
I got Kindled Orchid to roll with Rapid Hit and Kill Clip. It rolled with a Stability Mw, so it's not perfect, but more stability couldn't hurt. With my luck, it'll take a few more months to get the god roll to drop. Although Ada selling every frame every week is an amazing addition. That'll help.
---
I've never been a fan of Trust. Something about it just doesn't feel right. The same a bit, but not as much, with Spare Rations, since it's basically just Trust 2.0.
---
Once had someone who kept on saying “chalice” when it’s actually axes. Bad thing is he doesn’t want to admit he’s wrong and put the blame on me when I had the actual chalice. I mean, who the fuck confuses a cup with FUCKING AXES?!
---
The worst kind of teammate smh
---
You know, i actually spend some time imagining how my titan feel about this.... i mean, im a person very very attached to my parents, and since my character is an extension of me, i often wonder... even having no memory of your pre-life, how must she be feeling about her lost family? being at this point could bring something up? where would my father and mother remains would be? i would totally drop vanguard in some weeks vacation to solve this, zavala can mumble as much as he wants, i Ana Bray did it, i can too.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
(keep in mind that this course of action i would apply to me, and in my headcannon, i believe the curiosity can lead to lost feelings and eventually the feeling of missing loved ones).
---
yeah I hate his tether so much, it made me fall of the map so many times
---
I gotta do Last Wish more, just a shame not many people enjoy teaching on PS4 :(
---
I would only buy two. You can get the first two for 30 shards. After that, the price is too steep.
---
I went back into D1 a little awhile ago and used it. The arc chaining is the equivalent of running around with a onesie and shocking your sibling. I have no idea why it was praised,  except for the ammo regent and super energy, that was cool, even then, it was only really good on small arms.
---
Yeah that's what I meant, I saw a post awhile back where the poor fella bought about 15 cores.
---
Yeah I’ve learned and experienced some issues with spawns screwing up everything. Even paying attention to how the other team plays especially a 4 stack. 
---
I played a game of countdown on Eternity yesterday and the other team was down a player so we had a 4v3 situation. We actually got our teeth kicked in because the other team had way better communication and teamwork. Our team on the other hand, was running around frantically and get blown away in a matter of seconds. I’ll definitely work on my leadership kills from here on out. I’m Xbox unfortunately, otherwise I’d accept the offer.
---
Got it from doing tier3 with heroic. Not sure if heroic is needed tho..
---
Im xbox. I took 18 runs (give or take) for rivensbane. I refuse to run it because i like rivens bane at 19
---
Who here remembers the speed glitch on the Infinity gun in Borderlands 2?  I think I got it glitched up to 12x fire speed and used it to kill the boss in a few seconds.
---
Dope wallpaper. I cannot wait for bl3 looks amazing.
---
Off the top of my head, I’m not sure of all the possible rolls you can get with the Bygones, but you can never go wrong with rampage!
---
Just a shame they sold their soul to epic instead of being true to their fans..
---
I have a charge III I believe!
---
I find hammer head to be inconsistent.  Sometimes It's really accurate for me at long distances.  other times it misses and the person i am shooting at kills me in 2 hits.
---
The Gambit Pinnacle weapons are phenomenal in PVE, possibly the best of their weapon types. Although 21% Delerium is the only one of its kind. Haven't actually gotten 21%.
---
Loaded Question is also amazing. Haven't gotten Oxygen SR3 yet. I might not, though. For me Polaris Lance is the only genuinely good scout rifle for PVE. It might also be the best in PVP.
---
I just want a good legendary HC that I can get solo, and not have to play PVP to get it.
---
Took him two try’s I did it with my hunter didn’t get it then switched to my titan
---
They gave D1 hunter increased melee range to Titans. Not fun.
---
It was a bug, xur was selling it and non ps4 users could get it
---
He better be bringin' the Crown of Tempests this week...
---
Honestly Ace and last word are better than luna
---
jesus same
---
"I think you're bluffing!"
---
"Oh yeah?! What makes you so sure?"
---
**stares at hand full of 3d printed cards**
---
"Let's just say I'm a good guesser."
---
It doesn't work any more. It was a bug that was patched a while ago.
---
I wasnt disappointed as i got it during the Halloween event, but i did it again hoping to increase my power to 700 cause my heave was the only thing 699 still and it dropped at 699 lmao so sad
---
Don't feel bad man, raided last night with my clan trying to get like 2 or 3 people 1k.... And instead I got it to drop for the 3rd time. I am the one who should feel bad.
---
And the Drifter saying: "Orale!! Hive! bring a taco!". Now I really want sombreros in Destiny 2.
---
Unpopular opinion: i dont mind using cores to infuse and ive never personally hqd trouble getting enough to infuse
---
Bank those motes!
---
r/boneappletea
---
I got a Zen Kill Clip yesterday, it's dirty how stable it is
---
that's the goal! We are all really good friends and have played games together for about a decade. So it's how we make it fun and lengthen the content out. If we looked everything up we'd be done in an hour or two with all the raids, this allows us to spend multiple weeks trying to clear (since we only get a few hours a week together to play)
---
das me right there :(
---
You get 120 points at reset if you play three games the prior week, so once you get to 1980 just stop.
---
I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing, if the event is fun. It would be nice to have it more than once a year if everyone enjoys it. 
---
However, I found the haunted forest pretty boring after a while. We'll see if the minor changes here make a difference.
---
Yeah i was bummed after spending so much time finding the damn worms
---
It's people doing it purposefully. Dodging in this game don't count as a loss because the devs are incompetent. So people close to fabled dodge when they see a 4 stack to not get the L. Insuring the L for their teammates that don't dodge.
---
The drop rate was literally increased this reset. Have you ran a lost sector this week?
---
Reminds me of the new combination blow with Liar’s Handshake
---
All because of their stupid love for the enhancement cores and the fact that they didn't like people getting free 14 cores for completing Pinnacle weapons on 3 characters. And instead of that, they allowed certain people to get thousands of core. Brilliant.
---
Do you have a picture of it?
---
Chalice, of course it has to be chalice. Actually I heard one of the youtube raid teams use this and I legit laughed out loud each time they used this word
---
At least there are no such problems in my language
---
On my way to Bergussia, passed by a Public Event and decided to help out. Checking my inventory and came out to this. Sat down to share a few stories for old times sake.
---
I did, but only a few. I didnt have a lot of time. I'm going to go in today and run a lot of them
---
Do you have a picture or any proof?
---
I’ve never finished a raid because lack of clans, so teach me master
---
Yea that’s the bad thing if you don’t 1 phase him and his health gets to low it glitches like that. Found out the hard way like you lol
---
This is actually pree good advice, basically keep a full set of everything with perks you like, and cheaply infuse them when you get a powerful drop. You’ll have more cores to use for MWing and infusing stuff you don’t get duped of, like Breakneck.
---
I love Mars too, I think the view is awesome but I'd have to give Titan the crown, the Arcology is just so awesome and it has my two favourite enemies there
---
I've got the vernal growth gauntlets don't ask how but I've got them are they are minted
---
Only started properly using the Sturm/Drang combo after I completed the catalyst last week (was in my vault for months) and can't believe how much fun it is. Would love the arc equivalent of Firefly on the overpowered Sturm bullets for PvE though, only change I would make to this awesome combo 
---
Still getting used to it in Crucible but this footage is very promising, those headshots!
---
my FPS drops on Titan so I hate that place lol.
---
Tangled shore. Spyder as the vendor, generous spawns, lots of enemies, varied environments, and fun lost sectors.
---
*screams in Shaxx*
---
Also why not allow for more than one invader? Maybe 2 or 3. This would combine crucible like play with gambit making it real chaos.
---
This is sick!
---
Its gunna be a long journey, grab the quest from shaxx. Best advice i could give u is stay in the low hundreds in comp untill u get that quest to its last step. Your new to the game so its probably gunna take u 2 seasons to get. Your gunna have to go farm for a god roll pvp weps as well as maximize ur armor perks and mods. Comp is nothing but sweats once u break the 1300 bracket. You start to see more stacks of players who are in the same fire team. So id say find a grp either online or a discord and look for ppl around ur amount of glory points
---
I'm pretty fond of it too but I'm just not a fan of the way it generally looks
---
I agree the hole set looks really sick
---
I love this.
---
At first I was like oh look another Oryx drawing, then I saw the little guardians on the side. Love the scaling of him in this.
---
Depends on the skill level of the titans. The reason B is so oppressive is because the skill level of the user is irrelevant, and all the counter plays require a fairly high skill level fo the opponent.
---
Is Ace of Spades good enough? I tent to bound my pride to it.
---
Any idea how I got the gauntlets early.. I'd like the full set.. Can I put photos on here and il show you them
---
The one taps is if you have Sturm overcharge and you pair it with the new revamped bottom tree striker melee ability which buffs gun damage for 20%(? I think) for 16 seconds. 
---
Sturm is probably one of my favorite weapons in the game, and Drang is a great sidearm that compliments it amazingly. Both guns feel crispy and rewarding. I recommend rerolling your Drang masterwork (if you even masterwork it) to magazine size. It bumps it up to 20 and it's so worth it with Rampage. I could gush over these two guns for hours lol.
---
lfg
---
Much appreciated
---
whoaaaa......bad. ass.
---
I would love to fight this version of oryx in-game!
---
Here you go! https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-LDmIqbGbP74J_7rMKMTwrlcpQ1eEqU8/view?usp=drivesdk
---
feels bad that they patched the drop rate the week after a tangled shore flashpoint
---
OMG, I was that new guy. I opened the chest, it goes to the postmaster because I don’t have room in my inventory, and they ask me what I got. “Uh, nothing special.” One of the raid team says in a voice dripping with disgust, “I bet that fucker got One Thousand Voices.”
---
r/DestinySherpa
---
Hammehead, 21%, and Tractor cannon (cause fuck those spectral bladers in PvP)
---
I tried Crown last night jsut for the arc bounty to get done faster and I was impressed with the web spreading to other adds and how fast I got abilities back.  I would say Geomag for boss melt but I have read a few places on here it is bugged since yesterday.
---
Videos like this remind me why I'm doing so bad in the crucible grinding for The Recluse. Curse everyone capable of this lmao.
---
I’d be up to help, GT is Dbreadd. Just let me know when you want to do it and I’ll try to find time.
---
I'll add you and lyk thanks
---
Actually , I believe I did so [high damage](https://imgur.com/a/eiJabRe) that my team doesn't have time to catch up
---
 [**u/VredditDownloader**](https://www.reddit.com/user/VredditDownloader)
---
I did that questline early on in Y1 and at the time I wrote them both off, due in equal parts to my unfamiliarity with the game and the weapon balance of the time. This video has me wanting to re-evaluate.
---
Very cool, love it ^__^
---
Aww. Well, thanks.
---
Me: look at me, Oryx.
---
Oryx: ......
---
Me: look at me, dammit \*shoots eyeball\*
---
Oryx: \*Looks as me\* wtf man
---
Me: yeeessssss
---
When pvp was watered down? Skilled gunfights as in camping in the back team shooting with midas?
---
That's awsome
---
Thanks for the new background
---
A friend loves the fire and forget side of it...shoot from behind cover or around a corner...just randomly in their direction while you go in another.  With the buffs it might do pretty well now.  I stick to a Bad Omens or 21% Delirium for non-exotic and Thunderlord.
---
&gt; Ah, the old ‘comparing Ornamented AoT raid armor to D2 armor’. It’s been a while since I’ve seen one  
---
  
---
I don't understand your sarcasm.  The era of D1 that this armor came from is irrelevant.  The point was that the sequel title has worse cosmetics than the predecessor title.
---
I honestly couldn't say. Never paid attention and they just appeared nothing special but says something about extra when in the new thing 2019 I tried to take a photo but this subpost won't allow it.. I'd love to know how I got them coz I'd farm like fuck to complete the set.. I'm tamn69 on xbox live if you want to see them
---
You’re gonna finish your 40 matches before you get all your auto rifle kills. Go auto rifle only from here on out.
---
Maybe we could work out how I got them and farm for the rest of it
---
No he can't
---
I suspect i keep being booted of the match by someone...
---
We would sit on the plate and yell "FIST ME DADDY" to get a wipe out of the way
---
Might have to pull one put of collections
---
Breakneck?
---
As long as you have Orpheus rig you should be fine.
---
*Eyy, another year!* It's your **2nd Cakeday** Jokesorsomething! ^(hug)
---
I saw it twice in 3 games yesterday in regular gambit.
---
Inb4 blueberries finish it faster than you can turn it heroic
---
Very fucking cool! This would look awesome on any guardians wall!
---
And as long as nobody on OP's team backs out and leaves it 5v6.
---
Not really hahahahaha
---
Loooooooool
---
0 exotics for 2 weeks now. 3 weeks ago I got like 10 exotics. Game is taking its revenge.
---
EP Shotgun?
---
Last wish raid gear
---
This does put a smile on my face.
---
check the bottom left corner
---
I’ll repeat what the they people above me said bc it seems like that’s what’s going on...
---
There was a bug and you could obtain infinite amount of pinnacle weapons and share them for cores
---
Lucky you, after the update I now have 1/3 instead of 0/3 cosmetics 😅😅
---
I need to run this raid again
---
Thanks hahah, I’m still workin on sanding and stuff and currently debating wether or not to paint it black and gold or to just leave it
---
Wait till you finish the thorn lore book
---
😂😂😂😂
---
Ayyy I just saw this one on insta.
---
His insta page is @brianmoncus
---
Very cool!
---
What is meant by 'curated roll?'
---
Edgier than the sword logic
---
* Sights - Personal preference honestly  
---
* Magazine   
---
**Accurized Rounds** (+10 Range)  
---
**Steady Rounds** (-5 Range, +10 Stability)  
---
**Extended Mag** \- You lose reload speed, but your magazine goes from 40 to 52.  Extended mag synergizes amazingly with trait perks such as Ambitious Assassin and Rampage.  
---
**Drop Mag** is also decent if your ammo management skills are good.  
---
* Trait 1 Slot  
---
**Outlaw**  
---
**Feeding Frenzy (BEST PERK IN THIS SLOT)**  
---
**Zen Moment** is pretty solid too  
---
* Trait 2 Slot  
---
**Kill Clip**  
---
**Rampage**
---
Yeah but they move like 1 foot per sec. you could walk faster than those mfs
---
The worst part is I could see myself owning one irl and asking my wife that very question.
