today I believe
---
Daily and weekly
---
Yeh
---
No problem dude it's a bitch of a quest tho just a heads up lots of grind not hard
---
I got 3 questions.
---

---
The menagerie is the annual pass thing that gives 690 gear right? So if I do that and get the gear, should I just do powerful gear quest rotations like I normally do until I get 750?
---
Also what’s the point of raids if this strategy is available? Do raids give something else then?
---
And lastly, when should I do the menagerie? Because I have 2 other accounts that are around 500 light but they haven’t finished the forsaken campaign. So do I do the menagerie after I beat the campaign or before?
---
Thanks
---
I never raid. Cant stand jump puzzles. Im at 750 and have great gear. 
---
So sure. No worries.
---
That’s great to hear. I’m guessing you grinded powerful gear quests ? Or did you do something else?
---
the week before cayde died me and 12 other people lined up and did the odd dance (or whatever dance says its caydes favorite) one of my favorite tower memories.
---
Thank you
---
Core gain is easier now than those scrapper bounties. Banshee doesn't always make pve players go pvp. That weekly strike/gambit/crucible one is easier unlike forementioned bounties that for poor non-meta pvp players are easier. I really think that it is easier to do crucible quest steps during Iron Banner with also the Banshee bounties. So overall to me, the core hunt is easier. Not to mention if you didn't grind destination gear, there is a higher chance now finding cores and MW destination gears than before. You got excessive amounts of resources and want fair core hunts, lvl up destination packages and start dismantling them after buying. Then go farm more chests/resources/events and in no time you will have that source back to normal.
---
Sometimes people just gotta go.
---
Embrace the Praxic Fire!
---
The power surge quest will give you 690 gear on all your accounts.... so all characters will be 690... as for raids they give you special weapons and an exotic weapon unique to that raid...
---
1k voices-last wish
---
Anarchy-SOTP
---
Terrabah- crown of sorrows...
---
That’s part of the issue why they had to bring in the reins on Full Choke. Any auto shotgun with hipfire, slide, and full choke was a god roll just because they could laser similar to LoW.
---
The meta is a lot healthier nowadays minus that, minus sidearms and to some extents scout rifles seeing almost no use.
---
No they shouldn’t, use your collections m8
---
What scene?
---
how painful, it can't be worse than guitar errors during petras run
---
And so ravager casted himself from the highest point of Olympus
---
Just speaking out of experience, but don't use guided game, use bungie.net, log in with your account and go to "find fireteam". Posting something along the lines of "NA Nightfall 100k" gets me to people to play with real quick.
---
Bungie is no stranger to elaborate marketing campaigns. They’ve done similar shit like this when they still had halo
---
Just play the game and have fun.....LFG is a good tool to help with stuff... just remember some people can be jerks and expect you to have 100 clears for a raid... join a clan that will also help out
---
Finally I can one bang supers with the catalyst and it isn’t game breaking
---
I’m 1500 points from 3rd reset... maybe I can get it tonight. Congrats man.
---
Bruh
---
Not any more. They seemed to improve it. On PS4, i rarely wait more than a couple minutes for folks.
---
ez massacre medal farm
---
People really will believe anything won't they?
---
Not related, but I heard asian cheese is pretty good...
---
Traveler's Chosen (Damaged)
---
That was sexy
---
Literal shit post
---
When are we nerfing break actions
---
When are we nerfing breach GL's
---
LFG exists for a reason
---
I mean I get it, I absolutely do, but to go through the effort of 1 through 7 to not even bother to try again through 6 and 7 just breaks my heart.
---
If you got room for one if my m on I'm down for one psn imfields
---
The pattern changes with the single of the week, this week is arc so look up a pattern for arc week
---
Yeesh. I was getting ready to give up- I was hoping for rampage but got kill clip and couldn’t make myself do more
---
Yes. U get instant full hp and you will get an overshield that fills up over like 2 seconds. Your hp will also regen together w it.
---
still lower dps than a rapid fire sniper btw
---
Happened to me in IB!
---
I've started to msg people saying I reported them for using a game shark
---
thx
---
Big yikes
---
I have personally vowed to never go meta. I refuse to use shotguns because I think they degrade the whole pvp experience. I never use the meta because I don’t want to the inflict the same torturous pain onto others that you normally receive in your average crucible game. Basically, I don’t want to be an annoying prick.
---
Keep on playing dude!
---
The fun part comes when the next doc comes out and your work was pointless
---
I don't play on the console version but I do kind of hope that they just increase character slots and that way you can have a bunch of characters from each one. I highly doubt they will but I would think it would be the best option to prevent loss of progress.
---
You’re not going to turn me into one of those damn crystals!
---
I don't think so. Only way to get them was doing the special story missions.
---
I'm sure this question has been answered, but I am having trouble finding the right context I'm looking for so I own destiny 2(all DLC and forsaken) on ps4 and PC. I have more progress on my ps4 account though, so I want to play that on my PC. Will I have to buy Forsaken again to play it with my ps4 account on pc? Or would my ownership of the dlc on pc transfer over to me being able to play my ps4 account on pc. This is probably too long and has a very simple answer I missed but I really appreciate any assistance. :)
---
Facts, as much as the META is well Most Effective Tools Available, the META isn't the only effective tools. Had a blast with scouts and fusions this IB after not so much as touching them for close to 6 months. The balance is a lot better than most people give it credit, the META shit is just the most spammed.
---
According to the game stats, same thing.
---
Enhanced Linear Fusion everything.
---
But we don’t know if he would have to buy forsaken a third time to be able to play on pc
---
Nope because I’ve never heard of this sleeper stimulant
---
Use sleeper with blast furnace and ep shotgun or recluse and threat level
---
Result! Wish I could get accused of cheating😿
---
Can you elaborate more on this pls?
---
k thanks - I just completed the quest, and was hoping to use it.
---
video? :o
---
Arsenic bite and the vow and wishender and trinity ghoul are all really fun and good bows imo
---
Hm. I have all except the vow and didn’t really like them much. Might just not be the weapon for me
---
It's in the directory.
---
They moved to the director page. Left of the maps.
---
Makes me real sad.
---
I suck at sniping except for whisper, so something like a bow feels great. And there is always ammo lying around
---
&lt;MT Anarchy
---
thanks
---
See I love sniping, that’s always been my go to range weapon. Used to love scouts in D1 as well but they really aren’t that great in D2. Might have to give the bows another try.
---
If someone on your fireteam is using tractor, swarm out dps’s it i think
---
I’ve got no clue. All I know is that they both do a shit ton of damage, so it doesn’t matter too much.
---
True true
---
better to post a separate comment
---
Yep I got it from strikes . Thanks
---
Right! God bless Texas am I right?! 😤 lol 
---
And oh damn fr ??? Lol
---
whats its perks? what makes it a pinacle
---
Ive never been a danger to anyone else, but the fact remains, it happened.
---
Hell, i worked as a CO for a bit and even in private security.
---
Texas dont give a fuck.
---
Brb about to go to Russia and die in the evacuation
---
No idea, stole the picture off Google
---
To the best of my knowledge yeah, JTag and Jailbreak haven't been possible at all on current gen
---
No joke, my first comp game ever I'm pretty sure was a 1v4. Serves me right for finally biting the bullet to get the broadsword
---
Yea /: well maybe theres a way around it, U know with that wishing wall and finding the right fireteam? Idk but best of luck mate!
---
It's ok man, u got this! Keep trying (:
---
Did u tell him yet?
---
I’m pretty sure when you go to the tower you have to talk to the members of the factions and that’s why they are appearing, not sure about the drifter though
---
So since it'll be on Steam, will that mean we can change our names as freely as we like?
---
Try farming for a good menagerie class mod with 2 slots, and throw hive and taken armaments on there. Double dip heavy ammo on most rank and file taken enemies. I went and farmed over 20 class mods until I got very lucky and had one with Absolution and Heavy Ammo finder, so I doubt I'll need a new class mod again, at least until Shadowkeep.
---
I did some testing. If you have sniper rifle loader on your arms, and have it pre-loaded before you start DPS, your first 2 shots fall around 17,000 DPS on greg, and the DPS for the entire magazine is around 10,000 or so.
---
Without sniper rifle loader, its more around 8800, which is just under mountaintop's 8900 or so DPS
---
Spike grenade launchers are sitting around 13,000 DPS
---
Darci is 11,000, whisper is 10,000
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
It sits pretty high in the total damage in reserves too
---
Izanagi: 108,000
---
Darci: 117,000
---
Outrageous Fortune: 87,000
---
Mountaintop: 115,000
---
So overall, this puts it up there with the kings of DPS, and is a great alternative if you dont have mountaintop, sporting even higher DPS if you have sniper loader and can land your shots consistantly
---
Nope, I just told him that he's probably gone out on a mission so we can't see him
---
Both other times they weren't there though, that's what got my attention
---
Ooof. Well what if someone else tells him? Or what if he plays the forsaken campaign? Lol
---
It basically means you came through in a difficult situation. Normally when someone is the last alive and they finish the activity or kill all of the people at the last second.
---
I can agree with this man, oh and feel free to add me (Discord:pel5sik#8060)
---
I completed every single raid in the game atleast 5 times, not including sos (only twice), because thats pretty difficult
---
Battle.net &gt; steam
---
I see crucible love letters and are not just in crucible, excellent work guardian.
---
What that salty person said was rude, but did you have to reply in such a condescending fashion? No hate intended.
---
Yeah
---
I feel this on an emotional level. but I'm also super excited for WoW Classic. I'm really conflicted.
---
Thanks!
---
2nd run on my titan I got the sword. For the remaining runs I got nothing, did around 10 I think.
---
It's always titan. Theres a Netflix show about going there and the only thing I could think of the whole trailer was "the golden age days of titan were once the pride of humanity"
---
Thank fuck its getting off Blizzard. 
---
I can change my name whenever i damn please without paying 10 dollars
---
Titan: *Oh, you’re approaching me? Instead of running away, you’re coming right to me?*
---
Hunter: *I can’t shake the shit out of your hand without getting closer*
---
I'm in the \~690 power range, so not quite endgame. But I'd say it's above the range of people that are deliberately under-equipping themselves.   
---
But yeah, I've had more afk players than ones actually participating during my last dozen forge matches or so. Just a few hours ago I literally watched players in Volundr and Bergusia spawn in and run straight towards the area door to... just crouch in cover.
---
He must have a god roll for range
---
It's *Spindle time*
---
Well, that honestly just sounds like a guy not knowing what he's supposed to be doing. I'd probably have sent him a friendly message afterwards. 
---
But at least it doesn't sound like outright dickish behavior.
---
I got 39 after IB grind lmao
---
You also need to upgrade your chalice to access them. I think it's Power and Efficiency I that does it?
---
I had my honeymoon phase with it. It's a good GL. But, I'd rather use Two-Tailed Fox or an LMG.
---
Ohh, if that's how it works, I guess I'll be fine with that. The reason I thought they were getting rid of the other accounts not chosen was because of how they worded it in a podcast I listened to
---
This. Also if you are mostly a pve player and don't have much time on your hands try for wayfarer it's easy to get and you can probably have it with a couple hours a week put into going for it. I find having a goal in mind is always better
---
it's not about killing
---
it's about sending a message
---
-everyone who used a super on a single ad
---
The warnings new monarchy for everything and suros modular for the head
---
I run reload dodge on everything except arc 
---
I do not need my smoke bomb all the time
---
Nope!
---
I loved the emissary I wish we could get freaked out more
---
Yes, it acutally is. Blizzard's full name is Activision Blizzard, they may seem disconnected from the main company, but they are still Activision.
---
It’s good but I grinded all day for it only for iron banner to start the next day and swarm be better so I felt my time kinda wasted
---
I was thinking the exact same thing, but at least I had reached max light once!
---
I'll consider it!
---
I've not played with blink yet with the new helm. Been running ahamkara even though they've reduced the energy back.
---
Once, twice, 30+ times or so. It's about sending a message.
---
Thanks for reminding me to check my Finest Matterweaves, lol
---
Op what the actual fuck, endgame spoilers maybe?
---
If you add me on psn I can show how to get there. It’s quite hard and takes a few tries 
---
lazzzyflynn-psn
---
Stare at a fix point on a wall.
---
If you concentrate enough on it, you will blink.
---
If I'm ever about to leave a planet but have my Super, good luck to whatever enemy is standing there
---
Hahahahahahaha..... I needed a good laugh this morning. Thank you, suicide awareness bot. Keep up the good work.
---
Thank you. I enjoy you enjoying it.
---
I didn’t downvote any comments
---
no, he has his own opinion, which he is entitled to. you are also entitled to an opinion.
---
idk, there's a reason I have the wayfarer title and not chronicler 😅
---
You're welcome.

Crota’s a Hive God that killed all of Eris’ friends, as well with thousands of Guardians when he attacked the Moon.  Eris became Hive-y when she wished on an Ahamkara bone to be able to escape Crota’s abyss.
---
Thank YOU. You're breathtaking!
---
I'm 100% thinking of someone else
---
that strike was up three weeks ago, you missed your chance.
---
Damn I tried lake of shadows with a 215 handicap, extinguish, blackout , arc since, grenades and even after waiting for ads at boss we barely got out at 96k. I'm thinking it was because of the lack of orbs.
---
Shiiiiiiet
---
You gotta learn before you master it
---
For real, havent seen it either.
---
He is the One
---
Hey! Download the Destiny 2 Companion app. That way you can just create fireteams there and invite the people who join in the actual game. Much quicker and easier than using Reddit. 
---
And since Destiny 2 is alive and well, people join and respond usually within 30 seconds to a few minutes depending on the actual activity
---
I'd want mine.  
---
be exo, keep memories on backup USB I keep on me at all times, get revived as ghost, finds chip -pops in memory chip- oh. oh my. so many memes. Hey Cayde check this out!
---
This but... Celestial golden gun
---
Isn't this where the orb is for the Wish Ender hidden quest? Each orb played a voice line for the person picking it up. Maybe i'm wrong and just new.
---
'Merry Christmas ya filthy animal'.
---
With tractor, swarm does almost 50% more damage
---
I do this like minimum twice a day hehe XD
---
Third reset week of every month, my guy
---
Self loading holster is really handy on a GL
---
I can definitely understand that. I tend to be really lucky with nightfall unique item drops, but one of my clanmates is not. Even with our chances maximized (high score for the week above 200k) it took around 100 Savathun's Songs for him to get Duty Bound.
---
Give or take those weird 5 week months
---
I don’t see a lot of good looking titans, but this is a good looking titan. 11/10
---
TV Screen? Not sure what that is, do you mean the TV in Niobe labs?
---
oop
---
Actually non-void weapons get a 33% boost so its ~15% boost more
---
Great job. I'll join you some day.
---
Quality content :3
---
Do we know if there will be a way to transfer game files without reinstalling? D2 is a pretty large game at this point and I’d rather not redownload it.
---
Or if banner shield was deployable on long press of the super button, similar to barricade and how Ward of Dawn works
---
So if I buy all the dlc on Xbox but decide I want to play on PC I won't have to pay anything will I? this crossplay thing has me a little confused
---
Nice!
---
Great gun
---
Enjoy it
---
I certainly would say the dlc is worth it, especially considering how well season 7 is going so far. As for the move to steam, I don’t believe you’ll have to repurchase anything.
---
Spider gives you 110,250 glimmer per week after daily purchase costs (iirc).
---
Sloooooow Warframe
---
It would still ask you how your clans going.
---
i dont get it.
---
I was going to type a long dissertation that was basically the same thing you said but what you wrote is so much better. Brevity is the heart of wit. Plus it rhymed.
---
It do be like that...
---
It will when Star Wars does.
---
But it won't
---
Yup with snapshot and box breathing
---
Know what you mean, I just need to hit fabled now to get MT myself
---
Especially when someone blocks my way or pushes me and makes me fall down.
---
I got the exact same roll and it's the best thing ever
---
Thanks. It took a while for me to get to that point but i have found it helps.
---
That's it. It's just easier with Warlocks
---
I screamed the whole time.
---
You know what time it’ll end? (nyc time)
---
Laughs is Transverive steps
---
10pm.
---
Dammit. Guess I won’t get to play at all today
---
That's good. I thought it was some kind of glitch. Also is it even that good? Because I'm planning on getting getting Dreaded Venture from The Menagerie so I can use it with Last Perdition.
---
Yeah don’t play more than you want, you’ll just end up burning out. Let the game come to you. Don’t worry about max light, if you play every week you get there, it doesn’t have to be a race. 
---
Also grind the things you want and leave the rest for later.
---
r/ihavesex
---
How do u he traveler ball?
---
You already tried posting this the other day. Remember the subreddit rules.
---
Her nostrils are a part of the circle of dots on her face. It looks dumb.
---
If you finish the forsaken story line there is a power boost quest for the new Menagerie that will boost you to 690, starts in the tower with sweeper bot, then Nikita, then go to Nessus to grind the quest. Should take about 45 minutes to get you to 690.
---
I get weapons with mods but I haven't got a piece of armor with a model ever. But I guess its possible
---
Dodge is only as useless as the player using it
---
gonna hang out with your clan today??
---
Thanks a bunch man, mind adding me? Just looking for ppl to play with. If ur ps4 lmk!
---
They become available when the Masterwork is level 6.
---
GET IT GIRL....Yassss bitch! lol. Nah man good shit.
---
Agreed. Also all the raids are fun, so rewards be damned give the old raids a try.
---
Yooooooo wat
---
The best boy.
---
Imo khepris needs just a little more, like also making smoke bomb effects last slightly longer
---
I would've definitely quit then. Epic exclusivity is the only reason I won't buy borderlands 3 on launch.
---
No, you.
---
You spin me right round baby, right round.....
---
the rest of us didn't notice, because we have jobs.
---
should have included the /s. sorry
---
Damn bro! Look at all of us sharing the same great day! You as well my friend, and tell you buddy to also!
---
Lol fuck off, I have a job and also go to school
---
lol i still need battlenet for overwatch &amp; diablo but i won’t be using it nearly as much
---
Thx
---
If you have something to the masterwork of 6 and above it gains a kill tracker
---
I've got some 160 legendary sparrows
---
 Bottom tree is for Celestial........that's about it haha.
---
Can’t wait for rick kackis to make a ten minute video for every individual armour piece.
---
Yeah some dignity lmao 
---
/s
---
Everything that you have already bought you don’t have to pay for again.
---
She should get a certain fallens gun and reenact what happened to Cayde.
---
I need the Recluse. The quicker the better
---
You honestly don't "need" anything other than perseverance and dedication. 
---
And grenades. Throw more.
---
Well I don’t. I don’t have a TV and only use my PC for gaming. I stay away from news and media as much as possible and only use reddit on my phone.
---
Guess you could call it a..
---
patch of hurt
---
Recent Iron Banner? I’m still pretty new to the game
---
I thought they looked like Ghosts thanks
---
A soul?
---
But these help, no?
---
Not all clans are good though, they could be a collective of terrible.
---
What's the advantage of having a "soul" in this scenario?
---
Yeah. I hate to admit it but yeah they help.
---
Yeah that too
---
No advantage, hence the question mark.
---
Ur welcome
---
```yos```
---
Lol yeah that brutal 200 grenade kills....ughh!!!
---
That's always been a problem there.
---
I recommend you  try the game out, and see if you enjoy the gameplay, the plot gets better with each update so don't be disappointed. I started with D1 at almost first lunch, and the plot.... didn't exist, but in late stages of the game with Updates like Taken King (big U for a reason) the plot was great. You'll see it in 40+ hours in the game.
---
Oh, and fell free to skip the Curse of Osiris, it is only worth it to complete it when you want some kind of reward, nothing else.
---
That’s true but for me, majority of the time when it’s a clan, their primeval is dead by the time I even know they got one.
---
And, of course dumb me didn't saw the last sentence of what you wrote.
---
Spawns us so many times in the enemy's spawn and we get shot in the back :&lt;
---
One of the many little things that makes life worth living.
---
r/perfectlycutscreams
---
Yeah ik that’s why I said I was gonna finish it today but I can’t because of the maintenance
---
Thanks for the help, one last question, what exactly will I be restricted from playing if I dont have forsaken?
---
NERF DIRT, BUNGIE PLS
---
They estimated about 12 hours total, so probably another 8.5 hours or so.
---
Yeah man the struggle is hard I got hooked back into Destiny but at least the maintenance is for a good cause bc I played D2 on Xbox and have some exotics on their I’ll be transferring
---
Jesus
---
I can say what you doesn't need for sure with this loadout - is a skill lol
---
My Sword
---
Emphasize Menagerie would be my advice. Being able to choose whether a powerful reward is primary/secondary/ heavy/helm/arms/chest/legs/class is very helpful. Forges to a lesser extent
---
No, my aim is great with it.  I can direct hit anything with fighting lion.  I am saying its TTK is very slow in crucible because it takes at least two shots on a full health opponent.  One shot if shield is down - which only works if you have a good team.
---
get out
---
Just look up mynameisbyf on YouTube.
---
what these other two guys said. Titan's do just fine in PVP. Raid groups maybe want ONE titan for melting point but thats it. Standard day one raid comp? 5-6 Warlocks, 0-1 Titans, 0-3 Hunters as filler if you cant get Warlocks.
---
I’m not even sure what reckoning means. The completionist in me won’t allow me to skip quests. That’s probably why I never finished Skyrim, the Witcher, any of the dragon ages, gtav, etc. I prioritize side quests as I get them. Lol
---
Sitrep....I've been what the natives call "outside" the resolution is amazing but the gameplay loop is shit. Send help
---
Isn't it 7 hours?
---
That’s what I meant
---
Let's not get carried away fella
---
Never give up! Never surrender!
---
I was to. Then I started hating it because the shooting mechanics are ass and 99.99% of the “billions of guns” are vendor trash because they are all ass as well.
---
Then I was just sad because good snooty times game was down for maintenance.
---
https://youtu.be/qU0WJd9fUYQ
---
Why is that?  I mostly main blade barrage when I play Hunter bc I'm lazy lol
---
I started learning German to pass the time
---
Can you build a replica of the tower...or even the farm.  A safe place.
---
Me: Hey guys I'll go with my sto... 
---
Team: A wellock, great!
---
Did anyone notice that the giant tree in the background looks like a giant spider
---
Because bottom tree gives you crit damage.
---
That makes sense!
---
Ah I gotta get off my pve trip and start doing more pvp stuff...
---
One dimensional character whose best summed up as 'REEEEE GUARDIANS'
---
Outside? That some sort of preorder bonus mission I didn’t get or what
---
Definitely varies based on game mode. It can really shine in control/IB.
---
That socialist prick has to be every where i go it’s almost as anyone as AOC
---
that’s absurd your team couldn’t pull the win together with that many invade kills.
---
Waiting for destiny 2 shadow keep be like
---
I’m still working towards that
---
honestly at first I thought you would no scope oneshot both of them till they pulled back their hands
---
Today was meant to be the day. The wife is going out with her friends all evening. I’m just putting the kids to bed and about to settle down to an unhealthy stint in front of the screen. Sitting at 749 and will definitely get that final piece tonight.
---
Dammit.
---
I don’t really even play anything else anymore as life is too damn busy. Think I’m going to have to dust off Elite Dangerous...
---
I honestly don't have any idea who those 3 women are.
---
I am truly sorry.
---
Keeps it the same. It actually only gives a +10 stability boost.
---
https://www.light.gg/db/items/3301904089/spike-grenades/
---
Why should it be less of a DPS increase? Well heals you, grants everyone an overshield, and can reload your weapons. The banner shield is clearly inferior.
---
I'm confused this is English and related did something confuse you
---
Srs. Put in old D1 raids with iconic gear. I've never played D1 so it'd be 'New content' for me but I imagine a ton of people screaming about it.
---
"Artwork" nowadays is adding one photoshop filter over a character model? Mmh... aight.
---
Yoo i play ps4! Hit me up! I wanna get it too tomorrow after the maintenance!! Psn: BSeaBass
---
You are right, I was thinking 7-7 cst, but it is pst
---
having fun??? My guy says at the end he has never used fusions thinking these kills are impressive HOLY SHIT these kills aren't anything special lol Watch people like Jokercone, jetroter or me which actually have done impressive kills with a fusion and actually use one
---
Damn architects. These fucks seem to be above even the 9, I wonder if there have been any totally true facts on them.
---
What time does it end central?
---
Never give up!
---
A random conspiracy theory that's baseless without supporting evidence has no relation to D2.
---
Yeah I would have believed you but since if you look chat it says nothing about you getting the exotics so those pulled from inventory over DIM ... Good try though best one yet!
---
Shut up loser, this is destiny, go complain about things you dont like to r/the_donald
---
As far as I know, our knowledge on how the process works is rather limited. Guardians don't remember their past, but maybe personalities are intact? Uldren was deeply corrupted by Riven, but perhaps with a "clean slate", there's a use for him.
---
Either that, or the Traveler just really loves to mess with the Guardians.
---
Not from a Guardian
---
Sargeant Lammers!
---
What’s wrong with console?
---

---
AYYYY PC MASTER RACE BABBBYYYY
---
The grass of darkness.
---
OEM, sentinal shield, mid striker, hammers, shoulder charge, and bubble are anything else?
---
Go back to halo?
---
You better work I’m getting that 1.2 k/d up before you’re coming at me my friend. Stats wise you’re not even in my league. But we’ll see. Over 19k fusion rifles kills gotta mean something eh?
---
It’s like the whisper mission, it only appears under certain circumstances, the community is trying to figure it out atm.
---
Appreciate that! I was definitely laughing a lot right around that moment
---
Thanks a bunch. I have a ton of fun with it:)
---
Sometimes you just gotta hit em with it
---
It's an anarchy grenade conveniently stuck to someone's crotch
---
Bet you anything they noticed it during development, considered the issue, realized the time it would take to come up with a fix and test the result of the fix on the rest of the encounter would no doubt take WAAAAY too much time... So they let it be and added a prolonged counter.
---
.... also, did Bungie 100% create Menagerie and Crown of Sorrow? I'm convinced by several people in my clan that Vicarious Visions created both and Bungie only provided assets to them... Meaning this is a Vicarious Visions glitch?
---
It's called icecapade and was obtainable during the year one dawning
---
[Hmm.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/68/Slitheen.jpg)
---
It goes against the importance of the hunters cloak though o.o
---
Meh.
---
They were just running forward tiny bits at a time and I had a 20-0 kill streak without taking any damage
---
Do y’all know when it ends?
---
Sweet! Can’t wait to see it finished!
---
10/10 those boots are still made for looting &amp; that's just what they'll do.
---
They regen together now. That was its nerf.
---
"low pressure gigs"
---
somehow seems related to what happened.
---
The most badass game for the most badass manliest of men in the world. MINECRAFT. That shit can be scary yo.
---
Literally got back into the game yesterday after the initial launch of the game, did my free character boost with the expansion, played some gambit and started enjoying myself again and looking forward to my day off today to grind a bunch and bam, I read that announcement=( not being dramatic but that timing might literally make or break me getting back into the game again
---
Ok good
---
I think
---
Not sure if anyone has paid attention but in the triumphs it says something like apply 200 runes or something. No way they are expecting players to accomplish that if you can only do one chalice a run.
---
The servers are still undergoing maintenance, but they're up. So its evidently causing problems for some players. I was just in, but got booted after traveling to the farm. Also wasn't registering that I had Forsaken purchased or the Annual pass so Idk,
---
I’d rather have super long cloaks, like the current eververse cloak, with no hood
---
I wouldn't know, I already said I don't play warlock
---
I cant log in still
---
Playing some Dark souls 3
---
Restarted my console but I’m still getting told that the servers aren’t available
---
I actually love bows. Hmm maybe i'll go for it after i get the mountaintop.
---
Basically if you go turn in the offering from the well at the space telephone and it's your first week that it opens a portal you can jump through and see her throne room, I think over on the left command table with the dark pyramid ship thing there's a prompt to watch the cutscene.
---
I definitely cant. Still says servers are down.
---
Blue mini map people who usually have no idea how to play public events
---
Go look up Cammycakes fighting lion on YT to be proven wrong. Fl is amazing but has a very high skill ceiling.
---
Same
---
When you're fighting one person and another one comes up, shoots you in the back once, then teabags you like they actually did something.
---
Destiny item manager. Can’t live without this. Desktop app/website
---
Or 
---
Ishtar commander phone app.
---
yeah, it’s technically from D1
---
Calus*
---
"Oh thank god, something other than boots"
---
....
---
"FUCK"
---
Need a interactive “pull my finger” emote
---
I see the Architects hard at work as always
---
Maintenance is no longer over. Bungie pulled a fast one lol
---
Thank you!
---
is crossplay on the horizon?
---
Ah yes, for the gun I don’t have. (Damn rare bounty)
---
Thanks. I knew they were going down but havent had much time to check anything
---
No worries :)
---
Never played borderlands but Halo I can similarities in some places
---
There are gonna be some exotic quests that you can’t do if you don’t get the dlc in the annual pass for example the last word
---
When do they plan to kill it?
---
Damn I didn’t get my beta code yet!
---
Halo
---
There wasn't any DLCs after Forsaken. Osiris and Warmind were before it. If you mean the season pass for Forsaken then there is more content available for the Forsaken expansion.
---
thank you!!!!!
---
You are your character, we're playing as ourselves revived in the future.
---
On July 9th according to [TWAB.](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/47952)
---
Np
---
It’s what I would call a big oof. 55 more gigs to go...
---
Wow, you have a mighty e-peen
---
I think I played around 230 hours or so?  Just did some quick math on dtracker.  So is that a yes to buy now, wait or both?
---
Ok thanks
---
The fuck is with people making petitions for everything nowadays
---
Borderlands when it comes to gameplay loop with a halo feel
---
All hell will break loose
---
Was literally just about to buy this in [Battle.net](https://Battle.net), then seen it was moving to Steam, which I don't (and don't want to) use.
---
Oh well.  The search for a game to play continues...
---
Well they are down for today because of stuff
---
I personally think borderlands as it is the same genre (loot and shoot ) and has a lot of gameplay mechanics which are similar e.g. different heroes to pick from, different guns that u can equip which were looted from bosses and have different perks and effects (fire), there are different skill trees for your chosen character and finally it’s a free roam game 
---
I know many will say halo as the striking similarities in the campaign but look at it this way, if you gave the same story to minecraft as halo, the gameplay and everything else about the game would be completely different
---
That’s why I think that borderlands is more similar to destiny than halo
---
People are dumb. And yes the average is 10 minutes look at destiny tracker and yes it is work it. Or do you think farming 45 last wish raids is worth 1k. Managerie is one of the easiest and most efficient farms in the game. Too efficient rn.
---
Is it Thursday yet?
