How do I get the last word quest now? Everything says to just talk to drifter but it’s not there
---
---
---
Yes that’s why he made it his username
---
Please keep that orange buffon off Destiny 2.
---
What’s a guiding light ghost
---
I done it last night in probably 4 lmao
---
No lie, that sounds like a awesome name for a fictional character.
---
i got someone who was literally just the bow icon pasted 7 times over
---
By reading the thread, sounds like you don't have a steam acc. Easiest way for it then is to just tell him on his bday that you'll buy it for him and just give him your card/money etc. 
---
Unless you actually want to give him *something* then yes making a steam acc, friending him then buying as a gift is the way
---
Well this rant was already posted and people would not leave if after 2 minutes result would be 2:50. Bungie first need to fix the matchmaking. Apparently they dont have competent devs for pvp balancing. As far as pve content they are alright, but pvp sucks in every regard.
---
  Plus other real life issues other people posted above.
---
Thanks. I will PM you my xbox ID
---
Just the hunter. Decided I'm maining it this season so by the time I even play the others I should have bought most pieces for bright dust.
---
The key mold is still locked behind the forge unlocking questline. But since the questline was removed and you can't start it you can't get it. We just have to wait till Bungie fixes it and we can get our Izanagi's Burden.
---
you underestimate my power
---
I’ll admit it’s powerful but it’s NO WHERE NEAR as powerful as you say it is. You fail to see how you’re wrong because you refuse to accept that anyone can be right except YOU. Bungie put oem mask in to be a powerful crucible exotic for titans because they had no decent exotics for pvp at the time. They made it this way ON PURPOSE. STOP BITCHING.
---
you're welcome.
---
I did that as often as I could but after I have a small gambling addiction with Xur and fated engrams so I my funds only went so far
---
If killing the Vanguard is how we get their guns then ikora can get the fuck outta here I want my invective.
---
Bless.
---
I had two rampage specs, but on my weapons. I can’t simply get a permanent copy of it by dismantling one of weapons and getting the Mod back that way?
---
Ghost with +10% xp buff. Ladybug is the one I use. The eververse silver moon ghost has it, as does the preorder digital delux perk. I think the arc ghost from a couple seasons back also has it. If you are a new lighter you may not have one.
---
... Not byf...
---
Bruh what it’s amazing, literally broken in pve and pvp it can get 4k’s no problem
---
Me every time I mount mid air on my Scooty Puff Jr (Micro Mini). Except for the maniacal laughter as I spin out of control and take out an unsuspecting fallen.
---
Memento mori is one of the better weapon damage buffs since you can just reload after your last memento mori shot (if it’s a kill) and reprock memento mori, and firefly is always good to have
---
How long between melee charges?
---
As if he replied without reading lol
---
No
---
Sadly game cannot differentiate. It pisses me off when I am getting kicked of the server in mid of gambit match while not having any internet issues and getting that screensplash about how I left match intentionally.
---
I feel that. 
---
Im playing all once awhile for bright dust bouties but im enjoying my hunter too. Just gotta get that season grind on lol
---
I see. I just had a bunch of the black armory specs on my weapons and thought I could get them back by dismantling the weapon. So then I could have them in the 2.0 reusable form. But when I dismantled my weapons the mods just disappeared. Is that a bug? Or is it meant to not give back mods any more?
---
It’s part of forsaken, you get the quest for it after finishing the forsaken story so you’ll need that dlc
---
Keep in it man, I got the majority from grinding and it took me rough roughly 10-15 hours so if you’ve got the commitment keep at it. I’ll worn you though that the grinding may take a while but the ascendant level you have it beat after the grind is frustrating beyond comparison
---
Yeah I’ve noticed the same. It’s only happened to me when upgrading armour or moving my cursor through mods
---
I’m about LL 906, and is there anyway to get one without spending money?
---
"He is too dangerous to be kept alive!"
---
???
---
I know because they bring up their ghosts and leave and sometimes say crap in the team chat about there teammates
---
It wouldn't bother me so much if it didn't happen as much as it does and I shouldn't have to play in stacks to just have fun in quickplay
---
I also was an idiot and didn’t do a single boon of opulence so I had no discount which I regret
---
My current name is crippling depression
---
This could be the hook to a rap song and it wouldn't even be weird
---
The "imma drop a god roll to some someone who doesn't use shotguns" shotgun
---
god when i first saw him pop his hammer...
---
Every. Fucking. Time.  
---
  
---
Stop feeding the enemy team kills!!
---
Mountaintop season 5 get nade launcher kills.
---

---
: Bungie You fool you have no idea what you just stepped into you mere mortal.
---
I don't deserve this gun.
---
Youre the pleb over here
---
Bingo Bungo
---
Yes they removed the rewards from the vanilla campaigns. Not sure why they did or or why they didn't give a reason to. (they kind of suck any way so you're not missing out on much)
---
You make the next key with a key mold but it's unobtainable right now until bungie fixes it.
---
Whats the weapon? Not the launcher, the pulse rifle I guess?
---
Powerful, borderline broken. There are plenty of people who think it needs to be nerfed not just me. Just click around. The thing is stupid. 
---
I fail to see how it isn't. I lost a comp game against a team of OeM Titans with Erentil. It's a bullsh*t exotic. If that isn't evidence of it than you are just a delusional as the people who think they have skill for using it.
---
I was thinking Xol lol
---
If you preordered digital delux, the eris ghost has it. If you are a brand new player, at this stage no. Unless one rolls round in the bright dust section of eververse.
---
If you are an existing player, check your ghosts. One may have it.
---
I thought this was a skyrim screenshot for some reason.
---
30 seconds
---
*Bungie *sips drink* I'll keep this going. I got time *sips drink* and plenty of refills *sips drink* How are you?
---
After long thinking, my guess is the lost sector on the tangled shore, the shipyard
---
Poor guy downvoted for asking a question.
---
I'm stuck at doing the corrupted quest :p I just simply cant solo it and no one in d2 discord cant help either because no one is stuck at that quest other than me.
---
It's a common (white) gun now. The mission also shows up under a blue quest banner on the EDZ
---
Well to be perfectly honest, I think a lot of OHSA would be moot IRL, if we didn't suffer fall damage.
---
And it will not stay among us for long.
---
Its been a struggle to get the obsidian crystal ):
---
Kill the Wizards that spawn first For both standard and prime, the longer the match goes the more damage multipliers you get that increase the amount of damage you do.  Hit a point around 4-6x where heavy ammo or super can melt a prime in a few hits.
---
Well that’s a bummer, is there anyway I can get the exp booster?
---
WILL SOMEONE GET THIS GUARDIAN HIS CROWN!!
---
Think you have to have 4-5 people all from the same clan
---
I have to yet to find a good scout rifle since my first Nameless Midnight...
---
I believe I can fly plays in the background after 5 seconds
---
Hey its because its Available for  free and also on steam that's how I came to know this game joined destiny 2 not more than week ago
---
Similar to the cats in dreaming city
---
How do you start thorn?
---
Please stop making me play PVE for weapons
---
its not fun, its not balanced, and its by FAR the worst gamemode in Destiny
---
So what am I looking at exactly ? It's just the sword hit + Hunter jump and you can link that like that ? I'm playing Titan so not too familiar with Hunter.
---
I'm a newbie. I've been told by chat to just follow the white dot. Am I play the game right?
---
What happened with Devrim's engrams where he matches your gear power? Is he still doing that? The flashpoint is not with him anymore so I don't know if he would change
---
T h a n k
---
No politics allowed here.
---
Great for plinking priority target majors and ez recluse procs. Arbalest works like a scuffed Izanagis tho if you cant get it because of the bug
---
For the longest time it wouldn’t drop. It used to come from Amanda, but I think they changed it to be one from Shaxx since you have to play crucible to get the weapon.
---
Shaxx approves this
---
Doing it in strikes is doing it wrong. 2% per Gambit Prime.
---
Work full time and already have 110 hours into shadowkeep. No excuses, sleep is for the weak
---
Oh that tab, Yes I already went there and unlocked it. 
---
Held down unlock and everything
---
On 14 motes and saw one just on the side:
---
Your teammate with 3 motes slide and pick it up from right under you.
---
Drifter: Hostiles incoming from the other side of the fucking universe
---
Being invaded*
---
To be continued -&gt;
---
God that takes me back
---
I like it.
---
What is the Discord?
---
Interesting.... that's the only thing I could think of, so it might not be possible to restart while in progress. I suppose you could pull the scenes up on YouTube, or scour the web to see of some way to reset
---
I need to play Crucible if I want to finish quests to get weapons I want
---
You use it with Recluse and Wendigo. For warlocks you can use it with ophidian aspects or lunas to get the full damage out of it. DPS wise it is in-between firing line snipers and whisper more towards whisper though and it is a special ammo weapon instead of heavy so the way to use it is you empty your wendigo that switch to izanagis and since wendigo has auto-loading holster it reloads while you shoot 3 honed edge shots.
---
What’s the helmet for the hunter
---
I feel that that's reasonable given the comment I replied to.
---
The trick is not to care. Do the quests, and try to complete whatever the requirements are. If you die, whatever. If you get teabagged, doesn't matter-- you're x amount of % closer to completion. Just turn off the in-game music + voice-overs and put on some music.
---
Sick
---
There's a spot in the EDZ. Basically, when you spawn in, move toward the back of the Trostland and into the mines. At the end of the mine, there's a Fallen teleporter. Activate it to go to a new zone, and explore it until you find a campsite. Look at the ashes of the campfire to get the Lumina quest and open the chest toward the back to get the Thorn quest.
---
All milestones, all bounties, multiple characters
---
Omg I’m dead 🤣
---
“and then I told him, draw the rest of the owl! easy fuckin peasy!”
---
There's not a single pvp weapon you "must have" in pve. Tbh, there's no single weapon at all that you "need".
---
Bosses die just as well to an impact casing launcher or lfr with box breathing.
---
The vex offensive smg with the right roll is basically the recluse.
---
Plenty of snipes can roll mulligan
---
And the mida catalyst is turd.
---
Good meme
---
Thank you
---
The new system helps push people into tiers the game believes you should be in, theoretically. It doesn’t seem to be working as intended though, at least according to their forums and experiences. It’s supposed to keep the sweaties in their own little area and you with people around your same skill.
---
I think the system is good a good idea, everyone should be allowed to enjoy crucible, as well as improve themselves in comp. Its definitely not perfect, but it’s been way more fun for me, and a lot of people incredibly intimidated by comp, and I play crucible quite a bit. This is my two cents, and probably doesn’t matter to everyone, but I enjoy the system.
---
He died in the Forsaken trailerr 🤷‍♂️
---
I found that Ikelos handcannon in rumble works pretty well. It's got void burn, next to no recoil, and a decently high fire rate. Got the objective in less than a day.
---
Kindled orchid is your best friend for that
---
Stuck at the same quest, willing to do it with you if we can get a third (assuming you’re on Xbox)
---
That was so fun, never felt more accomplished.
---
So yeah I imagine jumping in solo at this point is pretty daunting. But remain steadfast Guardian! There's a lot to take in, unfortunately the easing into the game is kind of gone with the new light setup. If you have some cash, the Red War campaign would be great for learning. But there's here too if course and all the online resources. 
---
You can choose to trash old gear for materials. Generally something to do with any green or blue armor/weapons. 
---
Currency is used by the different Vendors (NPCs) 
---
There's so much to do it's really up to you. The grind tends to involve increasing power level with better gear, finding exotics, and getting your Hunter looking fly.
---
You can upgrade the ships for sure. But it's really mostly cosmetic.
---
Again, playing Destiny 2 from Day 1 had the easing into you are missing. I believe the goal is now to get new players into the action as quickly as possible, with the unfortunate side affect of neutering the introduction.
---
It adds a considerable amount of content. IMO yes, definitely worth it.
---
Nice.
---
its still broken af
---
Anyone remember cheesing the bridge on crotas end with bladedancer... ah good times
---
If Kindled Orchid isn't for you, get yourself the IKELOS HC from Warmind.
---
Metro Shift, Melchizedek Bramble, Crucible Carmine/Redjack, Vex Precursor Chrome or Calus' Selected.
---
That's a spicy one there.
---
Grab the quest, and then accept the triumph in your triumph tab :)
---
Well that’s a pain but I understand why they took that path.
---
I want it nowww!
---
What tools did you use to carve this?
---
Give me your rocket launcher right tf now guardian.
---
Correct. So he has 10 quests
---
First time seeing it
---
Join next weeks iron banner with this and iron burden lmao
---
How do you get this?
---
You got some good guns there though
---
As far as I'm aware, you still get the quest from the drifter. Since you can still do Mountaintop and Loaded Question (those two and Breakneck are all from season 5), I see no reason why Breakneck would be limited-time.
---
You don't get exotics at the end of campaigns anymore
---
Yes very much so
---
Luckily I still have a bunch of other stuff to do. I don’t need to do this one immediately.
---
No this goes into my collection of all my gambit god rolls. My RNG is retardedly good I’m D2 but I can’t even manage to cheese Riven 😔
---
What happened to use what you want? Though titan has one of the broken supers/exotics, what’s really wrong with using it? You’ll make someone upset? You won’t get banned, honestly if there’s a legitimate reason besides it ruins gameplay for others let me here it
---
Same here
---
They took out getting exotics at the end of campaigns.
---
It’s still really good. I don’t use it as often as I wish tho because I have other loadouts specifically for certain activities and recluse doesn’t actually fit some of them. But yes it’s still really good.
---
Good luck
---
I watched Esoterick solo that thing.  It didn't look that hard.
---
Fuck
---
no.
---
I saw a player named Dick Stuck in Vex. Shout out to you dude!
---
Did you defeat the arbiters ?
---
Did you kill the 2 giant knights? If not, then RIP you need to do it again.
---
Riven is still manageable these days even with the nerfs to well and rally barricade. It’s not your fault. Your rocket launcher is like the best thing I’ve seen on a legendary. Find the right team and that rocket will carry you guys.
---
when you can’t grab the key mold now so you’re stuck forever
---
no u.
---
Nice
---
it was an amazing quest
---
Wait so is it better than spamming prospector??
---
Need to use the companion app to search/create fireteam. I use it all the time to pretty good effect.
---
Yeah my bad sorry not that good with computers
---
That's not bad either
---
I did!
---
I'll try again, but I've been to him a bunch!
---
Killed them both and still nothing.
---
Fr
---
Titan player here, bring it on man!
---
The new armor system is kind of clunky at first, but once you start unlocking more and more mods you start finding those stellar builds. It’s a challenge to balance your armor for the situations you find yourself in and it’s almost like a puzzle and I love it. 
---
The new campaign is great, in my opinion. I want ALL the pieces of the campaign like right now, but can appreciate slow rolling the content releases so they can tweak and improve before release. 
---
There are some glaring omissions from bungie. I.e. vendor refresh, some balancing issues, nerds, buffs. 
---
It’s definitely worth picking up. Destiny is in one of the best places it has ever been, again, in my opinion
---
Why did I just do two intro missions and they both had the title appear on screen?
---
The one where Ghost resurrects you outside that Europe place and you get the ship and meet Cayde-6. Then the Destiny 2 logo flashes on screen.
---
Then I got a new quest where these big guys attacked the main ship and put that claw thing on the Traveler. Then the big guy kicked me off the ship and I lost my "Light". I wake up and... the Destiny 2 logo flashes again.
---
Also both missions had tutorials about how to play.
---
Did I do something wrong?
---
No I dont use no skill things. And Warlock has been my class since D1. I prefer Warlock over Titans.
---
Dude this is a blue smg that looks like recluse
---
It’s sarcastic
---
sexy
---
My mistake then, didnt even see the normal nightfall option. Deleting topic.
---
Try r/fireteams my dude
---
I actually got it a few days ago.  Definitely went the solo route.  Got lucky with a bunch of randos.
---
Me tryna get recluse
---
No worries
---
That wasn't hate. That was laughter.
---
Did they have a party that stated they were looking for a Sherpa
---
Lol I was looking through collections and saw that and literally thought about posting with the caption “discount recluse” but then I thought it was probably unoriginal.
---
K thanks
---
Should mention that Middle trees (3rd Subclass specialisation) require forsaken :)
---
Curious what research method was used here
---
Some people are just beyond salvation sadly
---
Way...WAYYYY easier to do get glory now.
---
Got my recluse and revoker within the same week.
---
Experience
---
It is but at least you recognized that unlike about 20 people along with the “mom can we get ... no we have ... at home”
---
they play a lottttttttt
---
As long as you have your highest gear in your inventory somewhere you’re good
---
I got no worries everybody love calling out crutches until you call out theirs. Then it's a legitimate strategy. I'll use whatever gun gets the job done. I'm guilty.
---
You mean: Full of trash you will probably never use? 
---
Yeah i totally can relate
---
Also seen later in King's Fall. 
---
What is this, a jump/pressure plate puzzle? I'll just sword spam a wall for three minutes, thanks.
---
It’s an amazing gun nonetheless. I got a 902 one and I’ve been using it all night
---
My buddy sword jumped across the ships in Kingsfall.
---
it was on forums saying smt along the lines of new to d2 need help/teach for LW raid.
---
You reposting dickhead, I hope you live a terrible life and die alone, be creative.
---
Right at the top of his post, mentioned that he found a post for a sherpa in the fireteam finder.
---
Use raid report man, that sucks
---
I agree. Just got my not forgotten right now! Though getting mowed down by 3 recluses is making it hard to enjoy it right now lol
---
Ok cool I'll give it a crack then! Thanks mate.
---
Bounties for everything
---
Just did the last encounter of GoS for 4 hours today trying to get Divinity.
---
I gave up.
---
If it’s through a reputable website, report them
---
I’ve never seen a post like this before, my brother had this in his inventory and me and my friends laughed about this for a week
---
Really any veist sub and a pair of peacekeepers is amazing.
---
Haha yeah, maybe a few exotics I use at times, but it's always the same loadout of weapons.
---
Yeah. This greatly affects the leveling of new f2p players as the nightfall rewards are tier 2 legendary gears and they have to miss out on those for this week. They should rotate the maps which are available to all players.  Just a thought.
---
Wait. Shouldn't that be said in reverse?
---
The Most High sees all things that we do in this world. Those scum of human beings will not get away unpunished. That is beyond fucked up, I too love to sherpa and teach but man I can't even imagine how much of a shock that was to you. The amount of pain they caused you, please give us their usernames so we can make it known to Bungie or something. This community is stronger than we think I swear. Keep being a genuine human who loves to teach and help others. You will be rewarded in the Kingdom for all the deeds you did here for others not yourself or for attention of others. 
---
It's always the greatest souls that get fucked the most in this hell of a world anymore... I was romance scammed and out of 15k that was promised to be given back to me (pathetic and embarrassing to say the least), little brother died last month to drugs, and to top it all off now my boss let me go because I am too good for the position. Like fuck me dude, this year has been just hell. Evil is so much more prevalent than it was in the past I swear, it's only getting worse... =/ Stay strong Guardian, let your light of love and compassion pour through all of us and teach us something here.
---
You do know that Destiny players don't even have to be adults. Even if you're an adult, people like to stick with their families together for both financial and practical reasons for a while. 10:00 is also a reasonable time to sleep. Depending on what you work or do.
---
If you're a grown up appearantly then why do you mock children on the internet?
---
yea but why does antaeus do that
---
There's always a bigger space rhino
---
Just new light
---
I've have this problem on 10 attempts of Forges I gave up
---
I had my old armor from the original starting mission and they changed all their light to 0 when shadowkeep dropped
---
Jotünn and fighting lion I think
---
I will literally carry my entire gambit team. I’ll deposit like 30 motes, get 9+ guardian kills, heal the enemy primeval multiple times and still lose the game.
---
I wish we could have an updated perfect paradox. If only a mod slot on it. I quite like it.
---
It should, i hope
---
Hahaha this hits home perfectly!
---
My thing is nothing compared to what you're going through. You're going through real world problems and I just want you to know that we (guardians) are thinking about you and hoping the best for you! Stay strong and just know things will get better Guardian!
---
The secret is those bounties you can only hold 5 of per NPC. Once you do the regulars you can BUY new ones over and over with glimmer once those are done. To be honest I wouldn't do this because the journey is half the fun of the rewards at the end of the tunnel.
---
Hopefully
---
Thanks guys 👍🏻
---
Sorry to hear this. Some people think that trolling is edgy and cool.
---
I ran AOS for the longest time in Forsaken,just to remember Cayde.......until i got my god roll bygones :(
---
Yes
---
Not in any way. It's purely to experience the other classes, as the totally number of characters is 3.
---
Farm for the curated Kindled Orchid. Drop mag, Rampage AND Kill Clip. It's nuts.
---
I once saw a guy in d1 named crapscreamer
---
“A gun doesn’t stop to think. It just shoots.”
---
Because they forgot to ball titans
---
Meanwhile I haven't even done a raid and the social features in this game sucks compared to Warframe so I am finding it difficult to do it with others especially since I don't have a mic. xD
---
How did you cheese the next step?  That's where I'm at (the strike) and I'm raging out hard.
---
Good idea.
---
Whisper of the worm, some shitty jump puzzles? Ez 
---
(20 minutes later)
---
What the actual fuck
---
PvP- OEM, 1 hit melees, a near infinite super, Bubble for protection and weapons of light.
---
PvE- Bubble for protection and weapons of light, Peregrine with a one two punch shotgun, a near infinite super
---
I don't know man
---
It's what I'm going to need to use
---
Both. I actually found it to be better in 3v3 because they're almost always grouped up, and there's less people to teamshot.
---
I got mine today as well.
---
I pick titan because my friends were hunter and warlock and I like using sentinel 😊
---
He used the the name Dredgen Hope and was member of the Shadows of Yor. He came to a realization that even the shadow followers were lost and they were much like the vanguard when it came to knowing the darkness. Dredgen Yor as we know was killed by Shin Malphur and despite Shin being a founding member of the shadows of Yor, he’s trying to hunt down any guardian associated or who has been associated with the group.
---
Go for the Polaris lance
---
No not programming. Just math.
---
I love the quests but god damn I wish the long term quests weren't counted with the counties towards your cap.
---
It's really frustrating on reset.
---
I did that quest yesterday and didn't know whether to laugh or cry when the Riskrunner got sent to the Postmaster instead due to an already full special weapons inventory
---
Probably not the place for it but I haven't been able to find any solid information on forging... How it's done, how to start or good weapons to forge. Can anybody point me in a good direction?
---
somehow this reminds me of roblox
---
How hard is it to power up an exotic when u hit 950?
---
Why does it seem like everyone blows past me on my sparrow are there sparrows faster than 160 or is there another way to increase it's speed?
---
I’m also a newer player to this game, but a veteran of the first. The first exotic I got was the MIDA Multi-Tool Scout Rifle. Depends on your preference, but it’s definitely not too bad. I can’t remember the exact quest, but you get it from Devrim on Earth. Xur is still here, so if you have enough Legendary Shards, check out the ones he has on offer and try your luck with the Fated Engram. Expensive, but definitely can be worth it (I got the Thunderlord Machine Gun from his engram, am amazing PvP heavy weapon).
---
The d2 saviour just as the taken king was to d1
---
They will be going to 750. In shadowkeep they made 750 the base level for everyone.
---
Load into the corrupted strike and farm the blind well for kills
---
Cheer up Guardian. Since you don't lose Glory ranks until Fabled I it ... might ... be a tad easier now. 
---
Granted, even now that quest is enough for anyone to get PTSD. I cringe when I hear my fireteam members charge up their Jotunn now.
---
When I get monte and going to my Titan and putting on insurmountable, it will be low-tier ad DESTROYER
---
Hello, new player here. I have a question about the 'melee ability dmg'. How is it that when I hit someone with melee ability I destroy their shield and some of their health (like 5-10%), and when someone hits me with their melee I instantly die? Is it about the armor? Can you boost the melee ability dmg? What am I missing?
---
Sweet. Thank you for the quick reply! I just didn't know whether that was only for new players just coming to the game now or for everyone.
---
Lol. Huckleberry works well enough for me tbh. Autoreloading smg with og rampage shreds so well
---
how do i solo que?
---
Thanks. Now I'm reminded I still need to finish both that and Whisper. REEEE.
---
In the playlist!!!!!!!
---
People will never understand how it feels to be the only hunter in a crucible match. Against titans. All using OEM and Fists o’ Panic. Oh and Recluse/Erentil.
---
I'm almost at the end of red war but i keep getting distracted hunting exotics. Looking forward to doing the other 2 free campaigns. And yeah I agree with everything you said. With destiny 1 it felt lije tgey didnt even try to tell a story!!
---
I don't think it can be done solo sadly
---
yeah i noticed that after i had it for a week and was like oh that must just be a light or reflection thats brighter than the engine thats cool.
---
It's over rated but it's still pretty good. Just do your research on what you have access to without it. If you can get everything but the quest exotics, don't buy it. But if you can't get any Forsaken gear, buy it. The Forsaken stuff is still the best stuff in the game.
---
I’m talking D1 Outbreak, only the vets will remember the difficulty
---
It’s probably the best destiny DLC we’ve ever had. 
---
Folks will say it’s TTK from D1 but I think the story is loads better in forsaken.
---
Relatively simple? Shattered Throne? You sure?
---
But Last Word is easy, yes.
---
Take a void subclass, a hammerhead, and a kindled orchid into rumble. You can crank it out in a few hours. Especially if you’re playing middle tree void warlock with contraverse holds.
---
Lmao I should be in the forest hunting deer then.
---
Not just guns that look cool. I'm trying to go for the ritual weapons for the seal and Randy's throwing knife is going to take pretty much the whole season to do. Why would they make a PVP quest requiring you to use a weapon type that isn't viable on most maps in crucible?!
---
Can concur.  Mythic is the new high lvl grind. Especially with the whole freelance playlist
---
That glitch is famous in the community.
---
It’s worth it.
---
I think petra has a bounty that lets you skip the 2nd throne run. It reads "present the talisman to an awoken warrior in the shattered throne", and the reward is Wishender
---
Someone correct me if I'm wrong
---
good raid. pain to teach to more than one new person at a time. as a 10 mobility hunter all of year 1 the gauntlet was the absolute best place to be in loved it so much.
---
1. yeah i having the same issue  my friend   
---
2. my spec 2070 rtx /i9 9990k with 16 ram
---
Bru stop being extra
---
Hello there, so I assume you're from Germany and also located there?
---
If that's the case you can join our Discord and the Afterwork D2 sessions.
---
Hallöchen, ich nehme an du bist aus Dtl und spielst auch von da.
---
Wenn das der Fall ist kannst du gern unserem Discord beitreten und den Feierabendlichen D2 Sitzungen beiwohnen.
---
Best pvp armor for hunters? And how to get them.
---
Js. People post shit like this all the time and it gets annoying. Just learn to use a PC Software.. I use PS4 and I post videos via YouTube and such. Because I know how much of a pain in the ass it is to watch a video with someone's hand constantly moving.
---
IB last strike is super hard solo with it being extinguished, you can never die through the whole strike.
---
The 820 one on the far right.
---
Do it the way every other normal person and do it in the strike playlist and use fighting lion
---
Tried two Manning the thorn strike got stuck on the boss :/ luckily got my other friend on the next day and got thorn 3rd exotic hand cannon (behind Ace and Last word)
---
You can find the Quests on the associated vendor - just talk to all NPCs in the tower and on the planets and see if you can find what you need.
---
Some are very situational and some are plain garbage , yes.
---
Kinetic*
---
And yes, the one from Eris
---
Well I'm sorry all my stuff is gone
---
fuck the bridge bois just use the sword.
---
The ride never ends &gt;:)
---
No.
---
One Small Step shotgun is only option in the Kinetic.
---
Noooooooo
---
cuuute! you got this ♥️♥️
---
You can still get it from this quest yes.
---
God same. I did the essence, the plating and the wire in an hour but the void kills is taking me days. Not to mention the black armoury exotics, lumina and whisper. Kill me now
---
Konodio da
---
Mom come pick me up, I'm scared
---
Yep, but looks like the distance is suitable to jump high as possible form those thorns and cross it with super
---
I don’t mind a grind for a quest, but some of these are fucking ridiculous. Rather than actually give us more content or different things to do, they just give us really long quests to soak up our time.
---
Is Destiny 2 worth starting at this point for a brand new player leveling from level 1 to cap?
---
Awesome thx.
---
Of course it’s a titan
---
Sounds like a good plan, Enjoy
---
Ordeal nightfall on Hero. I've gotten 6 exotics in 10 runs
---
Make sure only 1 player rides the elevator up because more Witches spawn underneath it. This happens on all floors. Killing all elites grants a platinum reward, often an exotic
---
Yeah I got like 3 exotics from Eater of Worlds
---
You too.
---
Yes. Very frustrated about it.
---
I tried duo but not sure what’s the best multiplier and power advantages to run for the easiest scoring.
---
Enjoy the RNG while it lasts, buddy.
---
Ive gotten 3 exotics in the new nightfall, but they were all random drops from enemies not end rewards.
---
Any reason in particular why it’s better than the other two?
---
Lemme know how it goes
---
Now Dismantle it.
---
A bow from Petra at the start, which I had already found twice randomly. Calamity I think. And then Petra's' pistol at the end called Vestian Dynasty which I've never found. Nothing else that I recall.
---
In my collection under armor / open world there's an incomplete set of armor called spoils of the shore. I have none of those parts and all the barons are very dead.
---
Lots people I asked if its worth of waste of time would disagree with you. They say it just meh
---
Same here, all other forges are fine though
---
Get quest from shaxx and just play survival until you hit 2100 glory. It's super easy now that they've nerfed how hard it is to reach 2100.
---
i went to her mutiple times and she does not have it and dont u get the item from the forge area off the cliff?
---
Can you no longer move armor? Because i did this all the time before shadowkeep when i was leveling. The game counted the highest gear you had in your inventory, that way i leveled up faster.
---
So I can't do nothing with the mods already installed in drops right?
---
Just buy it. I'm one of the fucking morons that paid money for Curse of Osiris and Warmind DLC now they were a rip off.
---
Forsaken is actually fun.
---
Yeah I got Monte Carlo
---
Super good smg in both pvp and pve because of its damage increasing perk that procs arfter ANY weapon kill. You get it from a quest from Shaxx and then just play a bunch of Survival until you reach 2100 glory. This used to be kinda hard but this season they made reaching 2100 a LOT more forgiving so it's kinda easy.
---
Well you can have other classes armour in your inventory but you can’t infuse using it. I don’t know whether having another classes armour counts towards your level for loot drops though
---
I'm pretty they mention the dimensions, so who's fault is it?
---
Check ur collections n recreate colored items. U should b able to create each piece at 750 :))
---
Still won't forget the time my team let our bank go from 60 to 0 because no one could be bothered clearing the blockers
---
Currently broken, you can only get Izagani if you are already past the keys section - bungie is being pretty spammed by threads regarding this, hoping they release a patch soon.
---
there's orange bars? am i being pranked right now
---
The heavy attack cannot one hit a striker Titan, striker lasts for far longer and does not need an exotic equipped to do so. Titans have a one hit ability (seismic strike) or a shield which far outweighs our dodge abilities. If you play Hunter you should know that blade barrage is an incredibly unreliable shut down for strikers as when they skate they miss most of the blades. Blade barrage is a sacrifice due to the face that we get three little knives to throw lol which simply isn’t applicable in PvP
---
Solutions
---
1) get friends 4head
---
2) get better guns, theyre not hard to kill.
---
3) literally do a public event, heroic or not, and they will spawn right after.
---
4) git gud.
---
They are, until you get sniped on your head way before you can draw your bow or get three tapped by a hand cannon or got deleted by a machine gun. List goes on ; pulse rifles, rocket launchers, linear fusion rifles even some fusion rifles etc
---
Mozambique here
---
Switch to titan, put on peregrine greaves and top tree hammers, and go to town.
---
Vex incursions spawn after public events
---
It's the "New Light" change with Shadowkeep. When the base game went F2P, the original story along with Warmind and Osiris went into Legacy Content, and every brand new character (made after Oct 1) will be at 750 Light.
---
Are you on PC? If you are and you don't want to delete that character, I'll happily drag you through some stuff to get you some better gear, but otherwise your best option will be to delete and remake that character.
---
They changed comp to survival which is shit for kills
---
I mean yeah you have one eyed and probably good luck with teammates so yeah you got legend it isn't that hard this season I literally went from 2100 to 4500 in a day playing off and on
---
No. Challenges are those golden icons on different locations.
---
What was the problem with chaperone?
---
Yeah you have to do 5 or 6 of them, then you get a mysterious prophecy, and complete that.
---
Really anything? There was a Titan Exo Chest that reloaded Autorifles. Did they nerf it too?
---
!repost
---
It's close but so much weaker. Fatebringer is on par with recluse level over powered. I mean when it came back the 2nd time in d1 they made all those raid weapons exotics they were so good.
---
AAAAAAAAAAA
---
not anymore really.
---
Vex incursions always spawn about 45 seconds after a public event ends
---
So with hackers they will always be a problem so it's all about the system they implement like battleye is fast and efficient for the most part not sure what system they have I've only just started on pc and havent seen any hackers at all and toxic players are in every game and always will be free or not they are there and it's in us as a community on how we handle toxic players if it will get worse or better this game isnt bad in the toxicity well not as bad as other games I guess we will see if it gets worse as the new players start to try and do end game events with vets
---
^ this
---
Card?
---
Hey recluse is a legendary and godlike just no random rolls
---
I don't get it, I tried it out yesterday and it's absolute shite.
---
M A D E W I T H M E M E AT T I C
---
Congrats man! You've earned it
---
1. No. This game is supposed to be playable solo.
---
2. My guns are power 920 and make mincemeat of nightfall strikes, they should be good enough.
---
3. I know this, but public events seem to be very rare on the moon. 
---
4. Fair enough
---
So basically like any FPS what so ever.
---
I got to Kargen (autocorrect Karen seems accurate) but couldn’t be bothered to do it solo, would have taken too long and I had bad load out I didn’t know I couldn’t change it
---
Use doomfangs instead of peregrines. You get a 4th of your super back for shoulder charging someone. I was getting 3 supers in a comp game a few days ago.
---
That does look to be the case. I'm usually pretty good for reading things thoroughly in destiny  to make sure I'm on the right track (the wording in their instructions has always been cheeky).
---
Gonna do a few crucible matches for the powerful gear challenge and then jump into Hero Nightfall. I need a break from strikes at the moment.
---
Thanks!
---
It's found on Titan and (I think) the moon.  But I know for sure Titan.  If you're having trouble making it heroic I'd suggest looking it up as I don't want to misinform you.
---
Great idea only problem is finding a button on Xbox controllers
---
Actually if you have the crucible ornaments they can be used on 2.0 crucible armor without pulling them from collections
---
Wish we had chat in social spaces on console. Text chat would be epic
---
10 dexterity, but don't tell anyone you leveled that up!
---
All this is right tbh
---
No problem
---
Biggoron sword/ anju and kafe sidequest
---
thank you for not making another " we have xxxx at home......xxx at home" lol
---
[removed]
---
Had the same feeling, I started playing 2 days ago. If you go to the hanger and talk to the NOC there she'll give you access to the story quests and previous dlc quests. They'll get you familiar with what's been going on overall. 
---
Bounties are typically daily quests, sometimes weeklys. Bounties help progress larger quests called "Pursuits" found at the faction leaders who also give bounties. Depending on the Npc you talk to, bounties will be game mode/location specific. For example the drifter gives bounties to complete in the Gambit game mode, Lord Shaxx gives bounties for Crucible etc. 
---
Overall it's much like other MMOs except now that it's free it makes all players virtually "max level" with some room to grind up higher. If need a hand you can join my clan Renegade Vigil and play with us, we're small but looking to start doing raids soon. Good luck and have fun man
---
Try to do the forsaken ones first, anything with the weird acorn logo on the top corner. There is so much to the dreaming city and it is a great leveling tool. After I would do black armory, which has like a split triangle thing, then the season of the drifter stuff, with I circle type thing, and lastly the stuff with a cup for season of opulence. It’s pretty much all up to you though. Vex invasion, menagerie, forges, and reckoning are great ways to level. I would also try to find a clan and do raids, I would start with SOTP or EOW.
---
Yes! I started a Titan, and 3ven though I knew the story and such, after setting all the quests I kinda had no idea where to go lol
---
do you know what a good roll is on a gun?
---
saw the 1000cc and was like "cool, a mario cart sub of some kind maybe!" I was so wrong..
---
dual of the fates
---
The peregrine strat is good but 1-2 doesn’t last long so it’s tricky for new/returning. I recommend cynthoceps. Increased mile range and super damage when surrounded. Especially good for a sunspot Titan who likes sitting in the boss’ face.
---
10/10 best menu screen
---
No, you’ll still have your characters and quests for cross save, but the DLC content does not transfer platforms.
---
Post a picture of your current quests and il see what I can do for you!
---
It can be pretty vague with regards to guiding players to the next part of the quests, but usually the quests should have specific planet and/or location on said planet, if you’re having trouble finding specific locations, it’s best to have a YouTube tab open as there’s plenty of 1 minute guides to location, hidden chests etc.
---
Ama be honest. I suck at crucible and mainly play PVE if I can get the recluse then anyone can.
---
Bruh im new l, like barely got to the Tower
---
Pre-change Rat King. That final step was a bitch. Having 5 minutes left on the nightfall. Took forever.
---
How does this look in other games or to people in your friends list without the font installed? Just a bunch of boxes?
---
On big boss super easy  run jump shoot pretty close to connect all then melee. Once you try it you'll see how easy an unfair this build is. Hunters was lil harder if there wasn't ads to get 3x goin this is all one thing don't need to build up
---
Following, been hunting for the essence from week 1 and never got one to drop.. been opening chests like a mad man..  this kinda sucks..
---
His opening line to us in Forsaken was about how stupid we were for trusting a vaguely friendly voice.  The fuck did he expect?
---
What platform are you on?
---
That’s awesome....shall b a guardian soon...
---
Green rocket launcher. Energy slot is a no go. Lowest he's able to get is LL123
---
WoW has been steadily bleeding subscribers for years, though.
---
The biggest thing I can tell you, remember that you can do some missions repeatedly to get specific weapons or armor, with different stats and perks each time.
---
It doesn't, your max light level uses equippable items only. This includes exotic restrictions (or at least it used to), so like if your highest kinetic and power weapons are both exotic, one won't be counted and it'll use your highest available purple weapon from either.
---
&gt;&gt; Merciless wishes to know your location
---
That good stuff.
---
Now to get the catalyst from the heroic version...
---
Previous seasons were definitely easier. This quest was also the only reason I wanted clash or control in comp for the progress.
---
This is exactly the same with me. Got the game for free in the winter of '18 and bought all the dlc's because I loved the game. Made a Titan last week and HOOOOLY FUCK. I don't even know how to enter the red war lol
---
ok. So if you go to amanda holliday in the hangar and talk to her, you will get the dlc quests.
---
What I'm saying is the only thing you can really mess up on is deleting a good item. there should be a new light guide here, as well as a "god roll guns" spreadsheet. check those out
---
I think I understand what they were going for. New Lights would be post-Red War and the new set up is supposed to reflect that, but it still feels janky. Outside of Forsaken and the Moon Invasion 2: Electric Boogaloo, New Lights don't have some crazy amazing backstory setting them up as the greatest guardians of their generation (yet) and so they do what new guardians in universe would do: go out and kill everything.
---
It's Mountaintop, not Fighting Lion.
---
PC
---
Oof, that will maybe (probably) be me in a following year or 2, also add some activities (studying english)... Yea I'll prob be fucked.
---
He said [this](https://www.removeddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/dhiixp/whether_we_wanted_or_not_we_stepped_out_of_a_war/f3ocwte/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf). I agree with the mod on this one. What the guy said wasn't fitting for a destiny sub and would probably result in political debates in this thread.
---
Wait until the last step, it's the hardest one
---
You can still run those campaigns
---
So can you get the 100k through normal nightfall? Doesn't have to be The Ordeal?
---
This looks likes so much fun.
---
You heartless monster
---
Oh so ur the guy I hate
---
Not Forgotten would like to have a word.
---
Thanks for the great reply. I genuinely enjoyed reading your points and I feel like you structured it in a way that conveyed what you were trying to get across in a good way to read. 
---
The season pass is easy enough to progress. As you said yourself, you are already level 80 and many people, without putting in loads of effort, completed it within a week meaning that no one will have an issue with getting to 100 as long as they play enough to complete their weekly milestones a couple of times. This means that the amount someone would gain form buying straight to 100 is rather low, due to it being so simple and easy to get to the top rank, therefore I don't think too many people would mind if someone bought up to 100 just because they really couldn't play enough. This means the people who earned it get to use their toys sooner, while those who paid for it at the end of the season don't have to worry about time, but have the negative of paying for it and waiting till they have the option to buy it, which to me is a fair trade which isn't that bad.
---
The point about being SO close the next level of a perk but having to grind endlessly to min-max to the fullest I can see where you are coming from, but again, I don't think that it is too much of a problem. The advantage of having that extra level could be as low as 3 seconds cooldown on a grenade or something to that effect, which for starters isn't that much of a change. But, it gives the opportunity to the people who REALLY grind out Destiny to go for something almost unnecessary but a small improvement to their stats which gives them a goal to go for. It may be annoying to farm for hours for a low low chance of getting something, but it is a loot and shooter so that's part of the grind. Not many people care for the extra stats all too much, and if they do it isn't so much to the point of being so close they feel the need to grind out for hours and hours. Just a fun thing to grind towards when you feel like you have done everything you can for a week. Also gives those people who do care a thing that when they do get it they can write home about and be happy that got it.
---
The thing about enhancement cores is you don't know about the 980 Nightfalls. They give Ascendant Shards (Which from this point on I will refer to them as golf balls) which cost 100 enhancement cares, rather often. This activity is absolutely for the most elite players due to be super hard and giving rewards that only end game players would care to want golf balls. This means that the people who would farm these activities out are the people who actually do care about that and this means you don't need to farm hours and hours to get enhancement cores at all!
---
I too am a PvP player, and I can agree it is annoying yo have to farm forever in PvE when you don't care that much for it and just want to play the PvP side of things. But, on the flip, a lot of PvE players had to come into PvP to get Recluse and Mountaintop, which were the strongest 2 weapons in the game. Recluse is still super good now so a lot of people feel the need to go out of their comfort zone and face PvP which is a good thing. Same the other way, I think it is great that people who play PvP and PvE get told they can get great things by going into activities they normally would NEVER go into which just gives them a reason to try them out and improve of them. When I first started on D1, I was SO scared of PvP. I hated the thought of being bad, but after a while I wanted to get better and after hours of grinding and trying to improve at it, I eventually landed myself on a D1 semi-pro team with 2 of my friends. That sort of development would never have happened if it wasn't for my need of getting a scout rifle called "The Burning Eye"
---
Back to the points, 
---
About people saying nasty things and being hateful. I am here to help moderate so if you report their comments, I will be on it as soon as I can and will sort any of those problems out. Unfortunately, when people are given anonymity and remove the fear of confrontation, it is in human nature to be an ass to other people. That isn't anything you can change it just happens which is unfortunate but it really does make you happy when you meet someone who is kind and nice to talk to online. Makes them stand out way more and forms a stronger bond between you and those people. Also, posting in a D2 subreddit and talking negatively is always going to attract bad attention, but that would be expected if you went into and subreddit based around a topic and had an opinion the community doesn't like.
---
I do disagree with the choice to put free exotics in the season pass. Unpopular opinion, but I would LOVE it if they added loads of RNG only exotics instead of just quests. I loved getting random drops back on D1 and being so happy and exited to use them all as I didn't expect to get them, they just happened. Quests and free exotics are expected, meaning you never have the feeling of having so many exotics you don't know what to do with them all, but instead gives the feeling of "I got x weapon to I dont feel the need to get that other quest completed for z weapon" Which is a shame, but it is the game I play and a game we all enjoy. 
---
IB always comes back 3 times a season, the first one tomorrow, then another 2 afterwards. If you aren't able to play for all 3 of those, then that is super unlucky. But that isn't a problem with the game and more of a thing based around a person living a busy life, and if a person is too busy living a life, then chances are they aren't going for the pinnacle gear. 
---
Hope you enjoyed reading this, sorry if things are a little wordy.
---
Where?
---
The floors get destroyed every time you open up a portal. (aka every time you destroy his shoulder/knee). The enemies spawn in waves, there are two waves that spawn with the angelic, so just clearing those 2 waves before you start dps should make your life a lot easier.
---
Anchor of light
---
How do I get this code
---
y e s
---
Ok, so not in a nightfall?
---
Wow it’s a titan woah so cool.    Get your toxic ass out off here
---
Each time you break a knee or leg, he destroys another floor (he can break 2 at once)
---
And i believe enemies with enlightened sheilds just spawn on a timer, they are suppossed to be spawning just after the first team banks their motes and stop spawning generally by the team the last team has lost enlightenment
---
Yeah, it’s not too useful for the middle of a fight but it allows you to prepare. Each race has a different shield type that they like. The hive like solar shields on wizards and arc shields on knights. The fallen have arc shields on captains. Cabal have solar shields on centurions and sometimes void shields on the burning guys. Vex have void shields on Minotaurs and sometimes arc on harpies. Both taken and scorn have all shields types. If you know the shield type in advance, you can grab a weapon that matches the shield type.
---
I feel sorry for anyone with the base 500gb consoles without an SSD &lt;\3

Me with Randy's Throwing Knife

No all natural
---
A true titan
---
Wow
---
The mind was meant to drain his light, not kill him. We also don't give it to him while he sits on top of its shell when we give it to him, that's just where he is when he writes the note for the PP lore card.

How’s it toxic? They’re literally playing the game...

The perfect paradox or "lost prophecy, another verse" from brother Vance on Mercury

It starts after this weeks reset, that's why i said it.

Funnily enough, Charlie is the Rat King in it’s always sunny

BAD. JUJU. QUEST.

My friend got 4 exotics in one day.

I have one exotic in total.

We only play together.

\*BOOM BOOM PUNCH\*

BUDDY YOU'RE A BOY MAKE A BIG NOISE PLAYIN' IN THE STREET GONNA BE A BIG MAN SOMEDAY
---
I think you get the quest from benshee but not sure really.
---
no ads aswell
---
Ok to be fair, darkblade timing was pretty forgiving.
---
it would've been a perfect transition from the new intro and then the player just sees the tower being invaded by Gary and the red turtles
---
Okay we'll try that. Thank you
---
Ok, we'll try it later today. Thanks
---
i like this downblade  super look amazing
---
Warlocks don't actually have a double jump, it's more like they tied some balloons around their waist. They have the floatiest air movement but they also have the FURTHEST JUMP DISTANCE. Warlocks aren't about pure height like hunters or jetpacking like titans, mainly in Crucible Warlock's glide is really good for flying around walls to confuse the kiddies who stare at the motion tracker. They expect you to run around the corner and not fly high above them, allowing you to be cheeky with your movement and get quick kills.
---
In PVE, leaping around is usually a bad idea since ads track you well, you should only be jumping to throw better nades or supers.
---
what about pvp ?
---
New players: I seriously didn't find this out until yesterday, but if you want to start the *actual* story to get a proper feel for the game, open the map, find Amanda (all the way to the right of the Tower map in the hangars) and talk to her. Start Red War, have fun.
---
Yeah, I wish the *game* would start with that tip...
---
yeah I might do, little inconvenient but meh better than waiting for bungo to fix things 🤪
---
I always loved this image. It’s so... peaceful
---
I have less than 30 hours in the game and I'm very bored, level 900 gear and nothing else to really do it seems. Boring repetitive quests, everything dies so easily, zero direction or "lore" to give guidance. I can't see why I'd ever spent money in the game or actually play it.
---
For real. Finding out the convoluted mess of steps you have to do to unlock exotics is a pain, especially when most of the content people are grinding LFG are Forsaken/Shadowkeep. And to top it off all the cool stuff is locked behind quests or raids that dont have matchmaking. My timezone has no clans or people playing. Guess ill finish the three campaigns and uninstall ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
As someone who started playing since the steam launch a couple weeks ago, this was my experience at the beginning too. 
---
However, after some e suggested that I go talk to Amanda Holiday, I played and finished Red War, and things make a bit more sense now.
---
So cool.
---
Is there a 4K version of that image for wallpaper use?
---
hol up is that a titan not running the unholy trinity that is called recluse, one eyed mask, button tree striker?
---
I didnt any others existed
---
I was reading bungies replies about it and they knew no one cared enough about Zavala lol they wanted it to really hit home and they knew that wouldn’t happen with him
---
If you are 790 light it will give you the option to talk to benedict 99-40 in the tower (he is near drifter so the spawn there is closest to him) and he should give you the quest to get the chalice and to get acess to menagerie
---
I just got my first HMG from the introductory black armory quest. I haven’t used it in PvP so far, but it’s been a game changer for PvE. Also found my first bow yesterday and that thing is fun as hell. I spent like 20 minutes yesterday on the moon shooting hive like I was space legolas.
---
Pc
---
Haha, I didn’t realize
---
This is how my gf is she just deletes everything she sees, she killed the fallen captain  :( that fallen captain is a bro
---
i was thinks the same about the balloons LOL thank dude for this awesome comment
---
Oh, I have some ... fantastic memories about D1 Outbreak. Couldn't find a team for ... a long while.
---
It's just that I read that and my mind went to "crap, I still need to finish the platformfest for Outbreak Perfected".
---
in the tower head to Amanda holiday (right side of map) in the hangar and speak with her.
---
she will offer you the story line campaign missions
---
EXACTLY. If you're going to make the quest text vague then give me the most direct waypoint system! Jeez it's hard to find NPCs that you need to talk to
---
I also have a Logitech but it’s the wireless g602
---
Nope. One more win bro.
---
Yeah the only way I found to fix it was restarting the game. What kind of mouse do you have btw?
---
Stealing this to troll people with
---
They are pretty good too, especially bottom tree saw blade, for each kill your super last longer, if you are playing pvp with arc subclass I recommend the arc bolt grenade, if you throw it in a group of guardians you will get 2-3 kills, nova bomb is algo a pretty good shutdown super

It would feel just as forced and awkward as ghost talking to you about revange being bad in forsaken at this point. That whole theme of trying to get your guardian to rethink revenge just felt totally random. It may just be me but i can't stand ghost in d2. He has no character, is bland and anytime he says something emotional it has no impact. Not to mention the stupid robot noises he makes all the time, it's obnoxious
---
I was actually surprised when i did curse of osiris, because having sagiri as your ghost was much more entertaining.
---
SING IT!
---
I enjoy it as well. Does not change the fact that they should fix it. Bungie even banned it during the raid race, meaning they realize the issue.
---
Fabled 3 is higher than Fabled 1 lol
---
We spent 2 hours before realizing that since I’m a hunter I can just throw a smoke nade in the right place and he’ll al to his death and we’ll finish the encounter
---
They rotate every week as far as I know.
---
Nope. 120 bro
---
Thoroughly concurr. Little blast from the past
---
it will give you 120 glory so you are 46 short to get to 2100
---
he has 798 Light and still has no option to get the quest
---
You're telling me the weird symbols mean something? I hope there is an in-game reference guide
---
What about it?
---
Forged are also broken right now you can start them but not finish them.  If track the fix before starting this
---
I hate crucible as well
---
Razer Naga Trinity (wired)
---
Lol, that Beavis and Butthead reference
---
has he tried talking to benedict in the tower?
---
this thing can be successfully infused in Sweet buisnes 
---
(not realy)
---
Hmm, I only lost one game before getting to fabled and I didn't lose any glory
---
The locations aren't that hard, bounties I can locate pretty easily. But the specifics of where on that location is rough. I'll try to post a pic after work
---
Aw shit I’ll get on it
---
"Call it a little 'bad juju,' if you will."
---
PC but thanks anyway
---
Yes, they say which dlc the thing is from. No there isn’t to my knowledge. I’ll try and find a link for a guide for you.
---
What the fuck are you talking about.
---
You have to claim it in your triumphs that’s how I got mine
---
They rotate daily.
---
Greetings.... pawn of the queen
---
yes, and he only gets the quest to do the leviathan raid
---
Like I said, you hide your low intelligence with aggression. It's ok, it's the only way you can.

Gotta run wormgod carress and bottom tree striker with this. Unlimited punch. Massive damage. Constant health Regen
---
You put your watermark or destiny's game? You took a picture of the artwork the devs at destiny made and decided it was yours? Idiot lol
---
I think they got rid of fireteam medalions
---
Good thing he already got the answer. Geez...
---
HE'S TO POWERFUL TO BE LEFT ALIVE
---
I remember in Destiny I chased Hawkmoon for 4 months on 3 characters until I finally got it. After that I don't want RNG involved in my gun drops. :( Thankfully I didn't care much about Gjallarhorn coz that one took me 3 years.
---
A pinnacle raid quest for a weapon would be an awesome compromise. I play solo and don't want to go through the hassle of LFG, but if there were a cool gun in a raid I would definitely raid more. I did make time for Scourge of the Past to get the curated Threat Level, and thankfully it dropped my first and only run.
---
Nah
---
Quest: Do the raid 
---
Me: “ight Imma head out..”
---
i think you make a very good point
---
Just a friendly reminder that if you do want this jacket, it's not a cheap buy.
---
I'm fairly certain it'll ~$180.
---
In terms of activities you can do without being insta-gibbed, yes until you boost your power. There's new options for Nightfalls that recommend higher power levels and raids.
---
But you don't have to upgrade just to get the higher level drops. Be picky about what and when you want to upgrade something unless there's something you really want to do that you're not equipped for.
---
And... BXR
---
"What is dead orbit?" I've been here since the start and now I dont even know at this point, same goes with nm and fwc..
---
Don't Open Dead Inside
---
That moment when you post the same argument in /r/destinythegame, but gets pulled for not being Destiny related.
---
Real winners do it all.
---
All weapon mods can be deleted, I’d save armor mods until you unlock their replacement
---
This is me but season rank exotics, everytime without fail.
---
Malfeasance
---
Dibs on posting tomorrow
---
Congratulations on all your success...
---
You smell. Wonderful BTW..
---
He's going the distance
---
Forsaken and Shadowkeep are DLC's. Forsaken is considered better than Shadowkeep( the newest DLC) by a ton of people, but I havent played it.
---
Season pass is rewards for experience gained. Theres a free tier and a paid tier. It's just loot.
---
You're supposed to do the quest specific version of the strike with the blue crown
---
100% over kill was the point. Boss melting is just fun like a vex overload just run back up an run again super fun.
---
You're welcome
---
Literally nobody understands what you were asking
---
pretty sure it’s really rare, you’d be better off getting to 920 and doing nightfalls, make sure the gear you get from crucible is made into legendary shards if you don’t want it and go check out xur in the tower for 4 exotics you can buy
---
The campaign starts with red war, osiris, then warmind. You can acquire the story from amanda holiday from the tower to the left of spawn
---
Yeah, I'm looking forward to get proper geared for them.
---
I don’t mind having heavy in comp. If you can’t secure/defend heavy you don’t deserve to win anyway. But yeah HMG are OP - hammerhead can wipe people out lol
---
"Looter shooter" is the gameplay model, not the pay model and fortunately the real-money store is only for cosmetics. So not sure where "pay to win" comes into it.
---
To apply the stuff you've gotten you go into the "details" of a compatible armor piece or weapon and then go down to "appearance", there's slots for "ornaments" which is what you've been getting that'll reskin the item. The other slot is for shaders (probably what you mean by shiney cubes) and those recolor or texture the item.
---
Your "level" is entirely gear based (there used to be a character level too but I think that was removed, either way it quickly maxed out and from there everything was gear based). The number in the top left of an items details indicates its "power", equipping it raises your overall power proportionally. Items will drop at a calculated average based on the max power of all equippable items in your inventory/bank.
---
It sounds confusing but in practice it just means to keep the highest power level of item in your inventory/bank of each equipment slot till you hit the cap (currently soft capped at 900, 950 hard cap). 
---
You can upgrade an armor/weapon you like  by going into its details and going into the first interactible box. This is for "infusing" an item, where you apply the power of one similar weapon to the one you want to keep. However this uses a very hard to get resource unless the items have the exactly the same name (in which case it only costs glimmer and is fine to do). It's usually best to wait to start doing that at least until you reach the softcap, and till then just keep using the best items that drop while identifying what you want to hang onto for later infusion
---
M8 you need to break up your paragraphs and be more concise with what you’re asking. This is all over the place.
---
Or you're dealing with an extremely stupid blueberry

Even though it's not his generation, I just have to say it.

[deleted]
---
Thank you!
---
Idk what that means
---
Also if you don’t have Monte Carlo, you can run a Barrier Piercing Auto Rifle+That one mod that gives you melee energy on Barrier Piercing final blows. I have 100 strength too and basically every 6 or so red bar kills and my Shoulder Charge is back up.
---
Sunshot drops from strikes. They have higher chances in nightfalls.
---
Highly skilled titan can also slide round corners with a shotgun. And when they miss there shot just straight up shoulder charge. Matter of fact they're faster than hunters, who are meant to be the fastest class thanks to all their mobility perks, all together.
---
Except thats not at all what anyone cares about when it comes to jumping it. You didnt even wordline glide. All in all shit video just like you.
---
Have to be when you’re running Peregrine GREAAAAAAAAVES
---
I finally, *finally* beat the Insight Terminus nightfall strike solo yesterday.
---
Was banging my head on that for the entire weekend, each attempt taking at minimum 2 hours before getting kicked back to orbit for taking a 'break' to prevent any controller destruction.
---
Final time was something like 2hrs and 46min, but good god, that wave of satisfaction I felt was something I hadn't had since I first played dark souls.
---
(key players to my success were getting that hunter helmet exotic for the single golden gun shot, and swapping from sniper + go figure to shotgun + arc dmg misfit + arc dmg grenade launcher with the arc singe mod)
---
but I'm telling you, getting a moment to stand on those plates to let the ghost do it's thing during the kargon fight was *rough*.
---
... now I just feel old...
---
Before you start over, check with Amanda Holiday in the hanger. She has quests to start each of the year one stories. Red war,  Osiris, and warming.
---
thats literally me with new light until I found out the campaigns were available at the hanger vendor
---
No because I'm on pc
---
But I know that will happen on consoles cos they are bad
---
Wait does it make you slog through the initial storyline again?
---
If you're playing on pc I could join you from time to time, I'm not a native English speaker tho
---
I know on some planets they added a specific icon on the map for the story missions, maybe go planet to planet and look. I am not home to check and have been playing since release so its a little different for me. I would assume red war would either be the tower or edz, osiris would be mercury, warmind on mars, forsaken on tangled shore and shadowkeep on the moon. Sorry if this doesnt help
---
This happened to me and D1, I was lost. Then I had to pay to go to Moon which I said maaayyybbeee later. And never came back, until recently started with forsaken package  when it was on sale
---
Gotcha, thx
---
Those swords aren’t rewards for campaign though. 
---
And they have y2 upgrade from prestige menagerie
---
the campaigns are available at the hanger vendor
---
Destinys Creed
---
Warmind, ducking autocorrect.
---
Nothing will be more fun then infinite seismic slam in pve with insurmountable skullfort
---
It's all about the hunter
---
The characters and pieces are all fondant you can remove and the cake is iced in buttercream! I hand painted Cayde 6 and his chicken
---
Lovely edit on his post btw. What he's done is expected an answer to an incredibly broad question. There's no logical answer to it.
---
i dont eat toast its all about that bread sandwich for me fam.
---
Does getting shadowkeep come with other perks over forsaken? from what I can gather from the description it comes with a free season pass, does forsaken not come with this? or id the price difference based purely on novelty?
---
Nope, there's a new tutorial/intro. Takes like maybe 5 mins and you end up in the Tower, not in the farm. Actually pretty cool.
---
I'm not. I don't do activities that are above my light. I take out vandals, raiders, cyclops and all that as quickly as possible. I'm using mods yeah, they barely help at all. Got my artifact upgraded to the max as well, some things are useful but they don't add health or anything. Guess i'll just have to accept that this is how the game is now.
---
Sweatcicle did it day one by sparrow launching, it was POGGERS
---
Constant melee uptime, you say?  Seems like this could easily be adapted for Liar's Handshake Hunter.  Monte Carlo + one-two punch Shottie + Any power weapon + Strength-boosting armor + Liar's Handshake = the Street Fighter Hundred Hand Slap, but in Guardian.
---
Real helpful buddy !
---
God I remember that. “Hey dude we’re going to go do blind well for a bit. Want to join?” “WHAT IN GOD’S NAME IS HAPPENING” or even worse, “Hey you want to do Last Wish?” “Sure, raids sound fun!” *Twelve hours later* “WHAT DO YOU **MEAN** THERES SOMETHING AFTER THE BOSS?!”
---
With how long it took me to find a team willing to kill Oryx and ignore the new guy that doesn't read the post and immediately asks "can we start from the beginning?" Raid report shows it took like a month and a half. At least i finally got the bad touch.
---
I haven't encountered this issue but I have heard that others are crashing during forges.
---
Best advice. In any battle, when the warlock is involved, keep moving.. Fire and jump, drop, glide.. Drop.. Run. Fire.. Use cover.. Jump.. Glide.. Drop. Works for me everytime.. Keep moving.
---
I was going too. It took me a week to finish the red war campaign. Got bored. You're so powered up at 750, it all seems pointless. Only real challenge was the final mission and how to start the damn campaign in the first place 😂😂😂😂
---
I do this too! Get the thunder coil perk from the artifact and switch to top tree striker for even more damage. I one shot Champions with that.
---
Just get your ass out of here, you dumb broad. Of course no one understands it if they're all as stupid as you.
---
Yes. Same console. Locked up twice at the same point in Gofannon.
---
- Check mouse polling rate and lower it in half. 
---
- are you using iCue? Uninstall and see if that fixes it
---
Cool!
---
Before Shadowkeep dropped you had to complete the Forsaken campaign in order to get this quest.  I do not know if they changed that or not.  I would think so, since you can do menagerie, with out owning Forsaken now.  Sometimes you get a special milestone menu on the left side of the directory, you could check to see if it shows there.
---
All in all, shut up.
---
First I'll say it's probably a scam. But in defense of those who are just helping people, since the freelance introduction to the game many have said it's never been easier to reach legend, some people getting there within a few hours of play. If this is the case I could imagine a nice person doesn't care who's account they are playing on as long as they are playing and if it takes a fraction of the time to reach the points than its hard to justify charging someone. In all honesty though there are streamers who do free recovs/comp help so your best bet is going in their streams and seeing if you can get help.
---
P.S. you don't need to worry about the new matchmaking system because it's supposed to save data every game so when you get back on it you will only deal with bad matchmaking for a few games until it realizes you aren't meant to be playing people of that skill
---
Yes it is especially bottom tree golden gun celestial nighthawk
---
And despite how fucking overwhelming the game is for us new players i agree still. I started at launch and poured at least 40 hours into it. which is like what you said is not something i have done in years. And i had zero interest in destiny because of it being associated with activision for so long. 
---
So when i started it on steam i had no idea what the game even was. I didn't know if it was a third person action game or whatever. It has been so much fun. 
---
Only thing i have issues with is that no one communicates at all. like do people use the chat function? the one you have to press enter for or is there some voice chat i'm missing because just coordinating is tough.
---
I had trouble doing it on console until I realized that you can’t do it on your second jump, you have to do it on your first normal jump
---
It’s quite niche but it’s a monster otherwise
---
There is a Trials of Nine Handcannon that is 180rpm and void.  It's really fun to use.
---
Trying to find challenges on the base game what am I missing? I can't find ikora at the farm... What do?
---
Over shield, health regen, and extra damage. Get rid of one of them at least
---
Odd dont know then
---
All the year 2 content became free with the purchase of forsaken
---
Do the 950 nightfalls they drop exotics like every other run
---
try this with skyburners...
---
Seismic Strike with Thunder Coil and Peregrine will do like 127k damage.
---
I realize min / max is a thing but that's enough for me.
---
What’s that best way to get a shotgun with that perk? Like what activities should I farm. 
---
I only just found out about this trick recently so I’m sure I’ve dismantled plenty of these shotguns before...
---
Other than getting good? Just gotta go online, lfg/destiny companion app and find people who are looking to team up and get wins. only options really.. team communication is huge too..
---
I can’t find a group because I’m only 933
---
Wow. Very 😂 . You must be proud
---
The usual answer for how to get better at anything is practice. And practice with a team, so LFG some people.
---
Ok the meme isn't, but there are plenty of posts on this sub and YT vids, and some destiny podcasts criticizing bungie for the game "not very new player friendly" and the OG comment I replied to (u/notmymainacc17 is my alt, just accidently fucked up when replying to the first comment) was talking about it not being very new player friendly
---
Is it just me or is riskrunner more op then I remember?
---
r/GamePhysics
---
It's quite the opposite for solo queue. As a solo queuer who hit Legend, I'd say most of it more relying and honing in on yourself then depending on your teammates since there is no telling what their playstyle is. Move around, be smart, teamshot, but don't crowd. Don't rage and keep patient. Can't tell you how many times I carried our team from 0-3 to a win. All you need is one morale booster and momentum starts building.
---
I'd say you're looking at the symbol and making assumptions. Might look like a hand cannon but before daily reset it was side arms.

I'm actually working on a full Valor reset without using any guns this season. It's gotten a little more difficult at Mythic but for the most part people gladly oblige my shoulder charges. Got my first 7th Column this season but I did sort of cheat with a grenade.

I think I saw people saying progress was reset. Like if you’re in the middle of forsaken when shadowkeep came out, you have to select the mission on the tangled shore map (bottomish leftish I believe) and start over.
---
I made it to Fabled in 3 and a half hours from unranked. I just started playing D2 and my friend who had grinded the rank in previous seasons wanted to laugh/cry.
---
Oh okay so I can't glide into it? I gotta run up, jump into the air by just clicking the jump button once, shotgun and then immediately melee. And that will work?
---
You dont need 1 2 punch for that, peregrines whole thing in crucible is deleting supers
---
The Shotgun you can get from the Lecturn, One Small Step, is likely the easiest due to it not having any quest or RNG ties to it. 
---

I'm impressed you avoided vomiting while on the sparrow, frankly.
---
I actually love the emblem that came with monster drinks.
---
That’s because it’s 2019. U can begin 99% of games today, read nothing and know everything, very few games in this day and age people are used to having to read for information on the game.
---
For example even if u read 0 and begin WoW today for the first time. U wouldn’t get confused as the game doesn’t let you do anything wrong.
---
Destiny just doesn’t babysit you, and some people won’t like it sure but it’s not a bad thing by any level
---
Play rumble and focus on staying alive
---
I've been able to collect my code. Have they checked off the triumph in game?
---
Make sure you did survival free lance or survival.
---
 Valor isn't the same as glory. 
---
glory =competitive. 3v3 survival. 
---
Call=quick play 6v6
---
Yeah, ig. It shouldn't have to babysit you though. It's a little stupid that games need to babysit people
---
Are those menagerie chests the ones on that ship on Nessus? If so, do they reset so I can open them more than once?
---
I’ll also check out that tangled shore vendor.
---
Can confirm this works.
---
Destiny's lore is such a clusterfuck. Kinda hard to believe a lot of the same people made Halo.
---
Had to fight hard
---
I don t agree. I feel its more 60% hunter. 25% warlock. 15% titan. Especially when u do raids or heroic menagerie. Reckoning. Anyways running titan is not easy like the other 2 class. The titan buff feels fair after being pushed aside for all end game activitie last 2 years. Hell. I still remember reckoning teams leaving when i arrive. Raid teams only allowing 1 titan with melting point. Hunters and warlock will always have their place as support roles. Well of radience and shadow tether. U know titans were a dying breed before this update.

You put too much faith in bungie. Look what happened to Nova Warp. Was absolutley destroyed in PvE because it was good in PvP
---
Epic backflip
---
Burn through all the campaigns before delving in pvp. This will at least give you some time to collect some of the legendaries and exotics you were getting killed by. Also xur comes on the weekends and he sells an exotic weapon and one exotic piece of armor for each class along with an engram that is guaranteed to give you an exotic you don't have. Every weekend just Google "where is xur" to find him.
---
Is this funny because they both have toyota camry in their names?

Hey man I'm a sun breaker and the wall+bag of friendship is a sign of peace D:&lt;
---
As someone kinda new to pvp, what weapons do y'all recommend using? I want to get the recluse eventually
---
I'm at 4300 and burnt out as I keep getting idiot teammates after having a good run. Its easier but still frustrating at times. Congratulations. I should have just kept going when I got the Luna's months ago before the nerf.
---
Moon bounties count? Sweet.
---
I'm making a build similar to this but on a Hunter with top tree Arc and Liars Handshake. I know it was nerfed, but it's still fun as hell to use.
---
I HATE PVP! GLAD TO SEE I'M NOT THE ONLY FUCKING ONE!!!
---
So, I’m kinda new to this game, and I have 1 question: how the *fuck* do you do that shit?? Looks fun as hell
---
Well I though we were just talking about sheer damage. I don't run Striker if there's a reason not to.
---
So then use the word “cockerel”, it’s a real word for a young rooster.
---
What console are you on. I can tell you how if you are on ps4
---
I found it -- it is under the bounties now, just mixed in with them randomly! Bungo makin me look like a fool 🙈🙈I apologize for my post, was very nervous that the title closed 👀 🙏🏽🙏🏽
---
Another excuse. You’ve calmed down now because you know that you’ve made a fool of yourself but don’t want to admit it.
---
what about the first curse.
---
99% of fans won't admit this, which is very true, if you get the DLCs you have some good skills and exotic weapons/gear which are good in PvP, if we are being honest, this game is not pure play to win, free version players are limited.
---
No problem. I was typing to tell you it's the gateway between worlds bounty. It's okay.  Go get your title!
---
Oh god 60 hours hehe quit your job or drop out of school we gotta get those numbers up ASAP friend start by running through D1 then work your way to d2
---
Light level 958?! I can't even break past 905
---
Izanagi burdon from the black armory season of the forge.
---
Its intended but outdated, once you complete 2 the others dissappear because you can only get the 2 weekly  bounty rewards. This allows you to to choose what 2 you want to farm that week. I do think non powerful rewards should be enabled for the rest of the weapons but thats how bungie coded it since black armory.
---
pc
---
Yes. I have my same guardians on Xbox and PC. You can link all 3 platforms on Bungies website and just switch as you go. But if you buy silver on one platform, you have to spend it on that platform.
---
Is no one going to talk about how brutal the moon loading times are between areas?
---
Theres 4 sparrows this season that are all modelled after weapons:  
---
Jotuneer - Jotunn  
---
The Regal Howl - Lord of Wolves  
---
Four Degrees of Seperation - Divinity  
---
Golden Pride - Fighting Lion
---
No I just don't care. I somehow managed to get Recluse and I never had any intention of getting it so...yeah. And I actually have to go to work now so see you in Gambit I guess.
---
You monster, atleast tel me it’s bottom tree sentinel for that juicy suppress, or top tree solar for the juicy crit
---
Sweet business 
---
Queenbreaker 
---
Fighting lion
---
Because canonically we are the same guardian .also I guessed .
---
*You're
---
Do you know how to open your director
---
Thanks so much! 
---
I'll keep an eye out for those guns. I haven't seen any quest notifiers for Menagerie-- where can I find that?
---
Follow up question: Do you happen to know the current meta of what weapons perform the best? Last time I played in Y1 it was all about scout/auto rifles which outclassed every other weapon's TTK.
---
p.s: Thanks for the help if anyone will reply!  
---
\-A fellow Guardian :)  
---
Have a nice day!!!
---
You can turn 20 of the blue ones into a purple one at the lectern, so definitely save them now.
---
You got this in the bag! Randy is almost home!
---
It’s in the hanger behind Amanda Holiday. The ball should just be there, and you have goalies they actually activate blocking plates and such.
---
Do you know what you did in the last mission?
---
I’ve got the same gear but instead of maxing out strength i’ve gone for grenade. Only because monte carlo regens your melee uber quick so why waste points for a quicker melee cooldown. My build has a 40sec cooldown for grenades in pve and 30sec cooldown with pvp gear on.
---
Ah, good old Sparrow tumbling. My Titan does it for fun.
---
The second one you can get from any world drop at random. The first is a glamor and you should be able to apply it like an ornament to any legendary cloak.
---
Good advice!
---
The vanguard dare(top) is an eververse set of a past season, and can’t be obtained anymore. The second, however, is the memory of cayde cloak and is now a very rare drop from I think the fanatics nightfall/from the tangled shore
---
I need to get a bit higher to even attempt that.
---
Maybe he's hoping he'll become a Guardian if he gets exposed to enough Light.
---
yep that’s it. complete the triumph “The Stuff of Myth”
---
Crucible should be available from the director.

Press and hold the button that opens your map. Then go to destinations at the top. Its the red icon to the right of the earth.

Will the progress carry over or is it like a parallel world where the progress splits off into it's own?
---
yes
---
which emote is that?
---
It's a quest, if you scroll through all your quests you might find the one for it and he'll stop wanting to talk with you. (it might not be the issue, but I had something alike)
---
This. But currently unobtainable if not past first step
---
The top one now it was an eververse item. 
---
Bottom I think has a chance to  drop from doing the featured adventures on the tangled shore while it is the flashpoint which it is right now.
---
Go talk to Ada-1 (Black Armory Vendor) she has a quest for it that you can just pick up now that Shadowkeep is live. However the quest is bugged and impossible to complete and Bungie hasn’t patched anything on it yet.
---
Sure! PM mr your Steam ID :)
---
No...
---
I wish they actually made it sound like a badass chopper with a deep, gravelly growl since it's belching flames out the back. Instead all the sparrows sound the fucking same.
---
BRRRRTTTTTTT
---
The duality of man
---
Damn, did not know. My first language is slovenian, couldn't be further from English. Thanks for teaching me a new word though
---
I'm gonna guess you play on PC?
---
Bungie account should've been made anyway. For the legacy stuff u don't need to power up. Ur probably already overpowered.
---
Sleeper simulant from warmind and whisper of the worm from warmind are pretty good. Sleeper is pretty grindy while whisper is pretty easy to get.
---
Survival comp
---
Just what I was looking for, thank you.
---
"Fing" is censored in "3Fingers".
---
First character, only started the game today.
---
It’s such a great game gimped by stupid choices like this. I’m two days in and barely figuring things out mainly by googling. The game has chat yet no one uses it either so I have to find discord’s and use website to even engage with others
---
This is my first character.
---
i love made-up lore like this. i need more.
---
Perfect! Thanks very much for finding this! Looking forward to tomorrow now!
---
Lost sector edz near firebase i believe?
---
I already have stuff that is over 800 but now everything is 750; weapons, armor, engrams all 750, ONLY 750!
---
Raids
---
That's what all the guides say, but idk man, I get straight glimmer after the first run lol
---
It's really how easy the Pinnacle weapons are to get, and how good they are. You only have to play a few hours for recluse assuming your good
---
i just hope they get backwards compatibility running on all previous games available plus the 360 games we already have...
---
Yea I can see that. But my gear keeps dropping at 750. Even now when I've got the quest to go to 830 light level. Still looks bugged to me?
---
I do have it, but I have forsaken
---
Exotic catalysts also count. Was playing strikes and the catalyst for Cerberus+1 dropped and it counted on the quest. Didn’t get any other exotics at the time. Just keep trying guardian. It’ll pay off
---
It takes about 6-8 runs to get one on average if i remember when my friend was running it. Menagerie is another way and possibly the easiest
---
Always buy everything he has first. Then you can never pay four times as much to get those four items in a Fated Engram.
---
Anything you pass on because "meh that's not good/what I need/not my class/whatever" is potentially an Engram that you'll get later *instead of something good*.
---
So yes, I did spend actual shards on Lucky Pants and Gemini Jester lol.

It appears you are asking a question about LFG/Clans, or help in-game.

Please post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/bzjpkr/official_lfg_megathread_v_4/) instead, look at the LFG dropdown menu on the top bar of the subreddit for various LFG resources, or check the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/bvr9ex/official_faq_please_read_before_posting/?) for possibly helpful advice on how to find people to play with our advertise/find clans.

This still triggers the leaver penalty, tried it in a similar 2v3 blowout. Your only real recourse to get back into a real match quickly is to run out of bounds / off edges repeatedly. Its usually quicker than finding the enemy to kill you.
---
Menagerie. 100% drop with range MW when using correct runes.
---
As if you didn't know. I've done this strike almost as much as our dearly beloved
---
Play crucible. Every tank up = an upgrade pretty much.
---
Play survival... you'll rank up valor and glory at the same time.
---
Pathfinders path lost sector on earth is the fastest farm method.
---
http://www.gamersheroes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Earth-Lost-Sector-10-Pathfinders-Path-Map.jpg
---
It’s RNG but so far it’s the most reliable way to get it. It’s very short just kill the boss and go out and back in and kill it again.
---
Oh my bad I Guess
---
There are a lot of things you like to see.
---
There is also a lot of things you *do not* like to see.
---
This is an example of a thing you *like* to see.
---
Hmm okay, maybe I've just been giving up too easily, I wa just worried they patched it out
---
Really? Well that’s neat. Thanks for letting me know :)
---
ah yes 750 xD but it's still kinda weird they changed it
---
I'll have to look up a menagerie guide then, havent played in a while. But ty
---
No they dont
---
I'd want to start a petition to give the riskrunner an ornament called the Thunderlad
---
Dude I'd trade every one i got i HATE shottys... then again im the preferred sniper so there's that
---
I love loading in to a match just as everyone in the enemy team is popping of their supers....
---
Huh?
---
Wait was Mara a guardian before?
---
Literally me pick it up last week. Im sure there's a story here somewhere but for now pew pew bang boom.
---
Guarentee 98% of the population doesnt know this is a spaceballs refrence.
---
This is a prime example of why pvp in this game is a joke
---
Handling isn’t going to make that much of a difference. The AB bow is one of the best draw and ready times as it is. Handling isn’t gong to make a difference in PVE when you generally have it out most of the time.
---
Some triumphs there are rewards.
---
Exotics are all luck there is no way to farm them.
---
Ooh, good to know. Can you get the essence more than once a week from the hunt, if you don’t have one already? I did one of each nightmare hunt just for the challenge.
---
That’s not cross save. You just transferred over from battle net. Cross save has to do with linking all of your characters together on destiny with Xbox and pS4
---
I need to sit down after having this pointed out
---
Thomas had never seen such bullshit. All jokes a side, great build.
---
First question farm the nightfall ordeal on higer difficulty. Those have higher drop chances. 
---
And second question nope. Sometimes emblems but nothing more.
---
Idk. I might have spelled or said that wrong. I'm small YouTuber so. I just put it out I might make a video. Sorry if I didn't answer your question.
---
I'm somewhat new to destiny and forgot that happens before the elevator goes up.
---
What time does it usually reset? I really want machine guns lol
---
Can you post the stat rolls on all the armor pieces? Really curious to see the values and what mods your using! Thanks
---
Anybody have a clan I can join?
---
Name tag is macjuggernugets on Xbox
---
I mean it isnt wrong
---
rofl
---
Oh that's not bad at all.
---
same thing happened to me. I didn’t know the rates would be this good.
---
no no, it's just right
---
This isn’t a place for self promotion.
---
Ahhh, I see what you’re saying now. Wasn’t really understanding before but I’m diggin it.
---
Yea I learned that the hard way lol but definitely will in the future
---
Ok, so to start off, don’t build around raids before you play, because they are very different from all the other stuff. If you want to do raids very early, then you can probably get to leviathan pretty quickly. I would chose the titan and go with sentinel with ward of dawn, because it now provides damage buffs, but I wouldn’t choose your class purely off of raiding.
---
Looks like someone landed on you as you jumped and the game physics said, "up you go.".
---
Players are solid in matches, right? Can only guess it was a hitbox physics glitch.
---
God roll is all opinions dude, there isn’t technically such a thing as a god roll weapon. Some people like rampage and dragonfly or whatever else, it’s purely dependent on what you like. I mean I guess someone combos are better than others but that doesn’t necessarily make it “god roll”
---
Thanks my guy
---
never touched D2 while it was on activision side of the fence. thought I wouldn't even spend a dime on the game. But after spending 60+hrs on it I am seriously considering getting both forsaken and nightfall seasons. bungie deserves my money if they get me to stick around a game for more than 50 hours.
---
Sneaky titan, smart titan, and punch titan
---
I telesto I can’t rember if it is good or not
---
1. Yeah, hang onto any weapons you really love, and upgrade them when you’re close to the cap. 
---
2. Exotic armor will roll with random stats, which will be better than the ones from collections, so keep those. For weapons, it doesn’t matter
---
3. After placing a certain number of tributes (something like 15) you can do The Other Side quest which gets you the Bad Juju exotic pulse rifle. 
---
4. Only the power bonus you get from the Gate Lords Eye will reset. However, they’ll likely raise the power cap to 800/810 next season as well. 
---
5. It’s just an activity that accesses a specific loot pool of weapons, several of which are great. They’re not necessarily the best guns in the game or anything though. They also won’t be powerful drops. The Blast Furnace, Kindled Orchid, and Hammerhead are all worth getting though, along with the Izanagi’s Burden exotic sniper, which is through a quest involving the forges. 
---
6. For armor you can apply ornaments from eververse to any legendary armor. For weapons, outside of ornaments you buy, I’m afraid not.
---
I don't see the difference here, you are talking price point. Being a veteran or new guardian has nothing to do with that
---
I'm working on getting breakneck, played about 28 or 29 matches so far. But no hazard yet. thanks for the heads up
---
I'm a new light player and I've been rocking that tree pretty much exclusively. I've tried the others but nothing is as fun for me as being the unbreakable shield.
---
It is part of the main questline. After talking to ana bray on Mars you will be told to speak to the gunsmith and he will give you the quest.
---
Halfdan breakneck misfit id go out on a limb and say that Cerberus with the catalyst is pretty good too the null from the prophecy weapons is pretty good too
---
yeah lol
---
Lol. Thank you
---
My man. Just a thing to keep in mind. Be mindful where you place your bubble.
---
You’re bad at Destiny
---
He is fast enough to out run bullets dont worry
---
Anytime man, good luck with the grind. Hopefully drifter stops holding out with hazards.
---
i thought that was speed cap! I'll try for sure, thanks for the tip
---
Np
---
Haha yea, nothing worse than dropping the super then having the fight move to a different stage
---
Depends on the raid. Most classes have their own specific roles within each raid so it depends but that's why they give you 3 character slots :D
---
I found out I would make progress if I activated disorientating blow and then melee the enemies affected by it.
---
How it feels to chew 5 gum
---
I'm sure I helped by losing a match against you lol
---
All class are good now. Hunters run teather w orpheus rig or Golden gun w celestial nighthawk. Warlock run well of radience w phoenix protocol or nova bomb w skull of dire amkara . titans run bubble with helm saint 14 or hammer stryke with peregrin greaves. All the class types have a dps or support role now. Really depends what u like or need in the raid team. Also depends if u have the exo armors to get those class up to par. Will take a while to farm from xur. At least a month. Now the rest is up to ur play style. Have fun in the raids. And for the love of god buy a decent microphone. Raids are about teamwork and Communication to complete teambased mecanics. Gg
---
&gt;The worst convention. 
---
Internet historian would like to know your location.
---
Ah, I've been using top arcstrider and top gunslinger. Why are the bottom better? So many details and such I got lost in the comparison... lol
---
Top + Gambler's dodge can be good, non stop healing when needed for melee strikes
---
I think you need to make a new character. A friend of mine I was playing with who was already a veteran on the blizzard launcher told me that he did not get any new light quests.
---
The new light stuff is not that important, it's just a story introduction that explains what crucible/gambit is and makes you explore open world zones on the planet. If you are already familiar with that then there is nothing new for you.
---
I am guessing it will become an exotic at some point, kinda like that Polaris lance did with the being a legendary first and then being escalated to a exotic.
---
CHOSEN ONE!
---
Reckoning gnawing hunger with subsistance and swashbuckler or ether doc with grave robber and rampage
---
You're fine dude. It's a really cool pic. You'll get some likes and probably a few comments. You did nothing wrong.
---
It’s my favorite movie. Gotta squeeze it in whenever I can.
---
Oh ok, i did not know it until I he died. Came to play d2 with forsaken.
---
It appears you are asking a question about Destiny 2 error codes or a bug. 
---
We suggest Google searching your error code for more information about what you might be experiencing, or posting in /r/DestinyTechSupport
---
Armor rolls randomly so eventually you’ll just get armor with good discipline. I’m not sure that there are enhanced discipline mods, I think it’s just the base one that adds +10 discipline to your gear stat
---
Wait you bought it? I could have sworn it was free to play 😂
---
That amount of damage is enough to kill roughly 24 guardians and its all stacked up on one man lol.
---
This is one of the funniest comments I've ever read and I'm not even sure it's a joke.
---
Brb gonna go murder some innocent genocidal death gods with my evil Light.
---
Is it just me or does the game seem way more laggy now that it's been migrated to steam? Either in game when changing zones and most of the multiplayer queues.
---
Should have happened by now.
