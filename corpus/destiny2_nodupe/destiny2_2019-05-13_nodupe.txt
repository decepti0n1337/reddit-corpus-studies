What shader is that?
---
---
---
[deleted]
---
Just starting armor no shader
---
But you can one phase a raid boss with it. It‚Äôs really a PvE exotic
---
Perfection
---
So....... by a natural extension of this logic using a rocket launcher against a capture point worth scorn as well?

---
Who cares if he was camping or not
---
Is rather have an upgraded engine

Bruh, Day 1 of The Dark Below DLC, I thought Eris Morn was a total space goth babe. Everyone distanced her, but I saw the beauty beneath those shabby brown robes and green, ectoplasmic Hive eyes.
---
From everything I have seen and tried with them, Liar‚Äôs handshake only triggers when on arcstrider. Even for the incoming melee portion despite what the description of the perk would suggest.
---
And some gunsmith materials to cap it all off!
---
So hot. Don't let those endgame armor guys bring you down.
---
Genuine question
---
&gt; all the content we have now 
---
Is this actually true? All I see from the last time I've played at Haloween is Gambit Prime and a few bounties from the annual DLC, as I refuse to spend over ¬£100 to play Destiny 2.
---
Pretty sure he went around the other way and kept Eramis's forces from retreating until we got there.
---
Lol my cat likes watching my ship just chilling in orbit. Sometimes she comes up to the screen and tries to touch it
---
Bruh that's not my question I know what I want/like I'm building a collection
---
I straight up started screaming and startled my neighbors.

Heavy ammo is specifically for any weapon that is in your heavy slot (third one down). Special ammo is for any sniper, shotgun, grenade launcher, and fusion rifle that are equipped in either the primary or secondary slots.
---
Some people's skill in this game never fails to amaze me.
---
You must present an offering that appeals to the gods of rng. Typically, these offerings include sweat, tears, a small box of personal items, your fistborn son and hours of free time /s. But for real, its really all just random, ive had dukes drop in several different places, typically from bosses and event chests if that helps.
---
Some world drops like Dust Rock Blues have an increased drop-chance in certain Lost Sectors, but the Duke is sadly not one of them.
---
Pray to RNGesus is sadly the only way that I know of.
---
much appreciated, the water got pretty muddied for me after the weapon overhaul.
---
they should just call it power ammo instead of heavy ammo.
---
This isn't an LFG sub.
---
Rule 13.
---
/r/Fireteams
---
I feel you. I‚Äôve been wanting a strong Duke for months. I‚Äôve literally never gotten a Duke with outlaw. Gotten a few rapid hits but the rest of the roll was trash
---
I was thinking, is there anything you can grind easily that garuntees a random legendary? I would probably gamble with rahool if it didn't cost 25 fucking shards
---
You‚Äôre a poet
---
It doesn't need to be that specific adventure.
---
Just go to the door on Patrol.
---
Thank goodness
---
I think Waking Vigil is the number one most easily farmed year 2 hand cannon. The drop chances of a good spare rations are honestly terrible.
---
it's fun as HELL to run around the planets and shoot stuff with my bow! idc if it's a raid boss or not.  it's very fun :)
---
Next season they are adding gunsmith bounties that will give mod components, so perhaps that will fix the horrendous mod economy.
---
That is only 10 weapons. I think we'd need to pool our materials with several other people to get a reasonably large sample size of weapons.
---
Hmm, agreed. Anyone perving in on our convo care to offer your materials for the greater cause?
---
Detonating a bomb?
---
they are SOOO fun! i only use bows now.  period.  and i love sniper rifles! but im a bow and arrow guy.  very very fun
---
"Perhaps"
---
I have a little over 3,000 gunsmith parts right now. I am inclined to believe the patch note, but there have been a few patch notes that were incorrect and/or bugged to not actually happen (such as Xur having random rolls on the armor he sells, or Dreaming City lore pages having the intended drop rate from lost sectors and ascendant challenges).
---
Wtf? How?
---
Imagine having to complete 10-20 minutes of redundant, tedious bounties for a total of 2-3 components
---
Yeah. Though in the recent patch notes i‚Äôve seen and other general spoilers for the next season i think bungie is being a bit cruel.such as the raid 6 hours after day 1? What about other timezones? For me it will be 12 am when it comes out. Let alone it being on day 1!?. So i wouldn‚Äôt doubt them taking them out, it‚Äôll be a shame though. üò≠
---
because people can choose to go with what weapon they want and feel comfortable with? O.o
---
This is it. These are the chosen ones to defeat Thanos.
---
Could have more too if you got a better perk than triple tap
---
Resource gathering for the next season. I have the majority of stuff I care about. Just teaching my clan all the things they haven't been able to do. 
---
Just killing shit, really.
---
I AM THE COUNCIL
---
Suggestions for those who do not own Forsaken and must be fully carried: 
---
* If you are a warlock, use healing or empowering rifts to help your team. If you own Curse of Osiris, use the exotic helmet The Stag. If you only have the base game, use Lunafaction Boots. 
---
* If you are a hunter, use the tether super with Orpheus Rigs. 
---
* If you are a titan, use rally barricades. The tall barricades will be vaporized instantly. Use the bubble super. This is more or less the ward of dawn's only time to shine.
---
I've got both for my bygones and I love them both. I almost always have an ornament and a shader on it.
---
In the Tangled Shore strike I always miss the damage window with blade barrage, and all I see is overlapping text that says "immune"...I started using golden gun and popping it when we're tethered and let teammates break his shield.
---
Because blueberries is fun to say.
---
God tier
---
Pinnacle weapons, titles, exotic quests, the usual,
---
So far it appears to be available 24/7.
---
Y'all lucky destiny 2 decided to not let me play it until I installed it again without my asking
---
Me 4
---
I met a guy named Neil Zinn on D1. The dude ended up being like a second father to me. He helped me through some tough shit, gave me some great advice, and was a real blast to play with. I ended up losing contact with my fireteam after some serious shit happened in my life. Went hiking and got caught in an avalanche, fucked me up for months kinda shit. What I would give to have those days back, playing with him and Slate again. Damn those were some good times, especially doing kings fall.
---
Yes progress counts in both
---
Was playing last night and was just in the zone, killing ads like no tomorrow. Didn't realise I was picking up motes.  Had 15. Shit. RUN TO BANK
---
Enemy team just banked and summoned 3 blockers.
---
INVADER!
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
FUCK!!!!!!!!!
---
\*sees that portal is up\*
---
JUMP IN PORTAL. HIDE for 30 secs.  
---
Invader out. I'm back on my side...bank 15 lol. Longest 30 seconds of my life.
---
The third person loaded in at the beginning with the other two of us.
---
Try looking at it with any shader you'll more than likely find a few that'll make you say dam thats pretty...
---
First choice is first curse
---
I don't remember seeing that at all...that would be something else. I feel like it would make more sense for it to be in Gambit if anything, seeing as it's Drifter-related, but then the RNG of having to get essences for different types of kills would be really annoying.
---
But it's so annoying that you can't preview them up close on a gun. You can only preview all the equipment together. I feel like I only ever use some of those 40+ shaders that I carry around with me.
---
If they can't increase the inventory size for shaders, it would be nice if they could somehow display all shaders that are unlocked in collections, in the customization screen. Maybe list the ones you currently carry first, and then all the other ones greyed out. Even if you had to manually go to collections and re-acquire the shader to apply it, you could at least preview it up close.

I know by now this post is 5 days ago and on reddit that might as well be forever ago, but if you are saying "He's a gun slinger, a lone bandit, loves to gamble, uses a revolver [in the pictures] a smart ass, and wears a cape with two horns that peak out of the hood. He even said in one of the trailers "Folding was never an option." About the fortnite character im gonna go ahead and stop you in your tracks and call bullshit. This was a teaser image to a skin that came out with the start of season 9 and this was the first and only information we got about this skin, so unless i am assuming wrong, this is a load of bullshit.
---
Truly the greatest of us all.
---
Yes I do bud it's so easy to do but please do "enlighten" me oh master of destiny 2
---
Ya i meam i dont know about you buuuuuuuut *cough *cough warlocl master race
---
I realized this after I reread it a few times ü§ï
---
Which was also more then likely endorsed by the team behind john wick because they werent the only game to see him as a playable character, so to me it would be a okay.
---
They 100% do.
---
Good on you. Sidearms don‚Äôt get enough love.
---
I never said they were skilled, I just said they were veterans.
---
Bro Polaris lance is hella sexy. What the hell. Shit hot. Jade rabbits all about them picks and body shot and when your ready bam!!! Headshot
---
For PS4 you can change your VidCap settings. Personally mine records the last 15 minutes and as soon as I hit ‚ÄúRecord Clip‚Äù it grabs the last 15. Im sure you can change it to the last hour, half hour, and i think 5 or 10 minutes. Super useful
---
I got mine a few days ago and haven't seen any on there. Are you saying they drop from Engrams or that they're for sale?
---
Zero hour with Borealis ONLY
---
While true. This type of content takes months to make (like 6) you just cant crack this type of thing out quickly so its best to keep expections in check 
---
Devs have lives too they want to see there families lol
---
Though i agree this type of stuff is fantastic would rather have dead periods with peeks of good quality stuff....than 90% of what we have had so far
---
They are in packages just like the ornaments for thunderlord, thorn and whisper

Scouts are good in pvp. Just suck in pve same as auto rifles suck in pve.
---
Prob the best PvE weapon in the game that's ironically a crucible Pinnacle weapon.
---
Fuck you man why you gotta tease me. God would I kill for a weapon to be able to look like that
---
No doubt
---
I have a video of a cabal trooper jumping over me in gambit where he eclipses the sun and all you see is glowing red eyes that's kinda spooky
---
Where's the Sunshot????
---
I'm on Xbox and I just have to hit the home button then X which records the last 30 seconds of gameplay.
---
Stop giving ideas dammit
---
Weapon cores don't drop if you collect the 25 mats first
---
Currently sitting in the middle ground between the Drifter and Aunor. The City needs protecting, but we need every advantage we can get in the coming fights.
---
Hello, sir. Do you have time to talk about our Lord and Savior, Variks, the Loyal?
---
He casts Ward of Dawn, then strafes in and out of the bubble to grant him shield and damage increase. Your damage from the grenade that you are seeing are actually on the bubble not him. You land 2 headshots for 55 and a handful of body shots but he re-acquires his shield 3-4 times in this clip?
---
* **Armor of Light**: While inside Ward of Dawn you and your allies gain significant damage resistance.
---
* **Blessing of Light**: Passing through Ward of Dawn grants you and your allies a shield that lasts 10 seconds.
---
* **~~Weapons of Light~~**~~: Passing through Ward of Dawn grants you and your allies a 25% increase to weapon damage for 10 seconds.~~  (I was wrong, not a titan, forgive me)
---
In summation, they were sweating a little hard, as can be told by the curb stomp of a score up north. Interesting clip though.
---
Exactly. He even contemplates to let our Titans train his troops once he is on the Throne again (extracted from Titan Raid Gear, I think it was the "Emperor's Champion Mark")
---
Agreed.
---
100%
---
üòã
---
Recluse or mindbender's would cover your ground for short-range play
---
Vex have clubs?
---
I think all of the class's are pretty equal im a warlock main but my friend is a titan and i find that melting point is really helpful as well as hammers is a good add clearing super
---
Yeehaw gang is always the best, think
---
&gt;Has cowboy gun
---
&gt;Has Deus Vult worthy super
---
&gt;Has deranged leader who plunges you into darkness to see if you become edgy or become chill, kills you if you become edgy
---
What's not to like?
---
You have a valid point, but with Bungie's now limited pockets and manpower, it's definetly very tough for them to make things like this very frequent. I honestly don't have any ideas on how they can keep the playerbase alive at this point, people leave after a month, and come back for a month.

Don‚Äôt make me put a bubble on your well!

Reaper Leviathans grew legs!
---
Depends on the situations.
---
-In Reckoning, despite the hate, Middle tree is essential for staggering majors on the bridge.
---
-Bottom tree striker is great for ad clear and one-inch/shot punching majors.
---
-Thundercrash still sucks, but the melee is pretty much a toned down super.
---
-Bottom tree Sunbreaker and Top tree striker both suck, while bottom tree sentinel is real close to sucking, but is still useful in some applications.
---
I'd disagree. Shotguns are actually fairly balanced. If you're smart with your plays then a shotgun shouldn't be able to get close enough to really ruin your day. Yes, there are those times when you turn a corner and get buckshot to the skull but more often then not you can play around average shotgun users fairly easily. 
---
Now, if they are skilled players, lmao gg since skilled shotgun users will destroy any hope of Luna, Recluse, absolutely anything.
---
/r/Boneappletea
---
But thats not the question...?
---
They don‚Äôt help with exotic drops that‚Äôs a myth
---
I have always felt that way. I never use them and have decent luck with RNG. Now my clan mates always use them and are always complaining that nothing drop for them. Maybe nothing, but I have always felt that they were broke and never use them.
---
Before DLC's, Antiope-D + The End were my go to guns
---
you know something is wrong with his texting when pvrfvctd auto corrects to perverted
---
As a PvE player. I‚Äôm guilty of all of these at one point or another
---
you have to get the fallen transponder from the weekly heroic mission on titan, there's a door that's unlocked that you usually can't go through to your left after you kill the shrieker, then there's a pda on the table you pick up 
---
after that you have to go grab hidden items from a bunch of lost sectors on earth and nessus, and once you do that you can meet with mithrax on the farm to start the mission 
---
you'll wanna get a fireteam together for the mission too, especially if you aren't quite at Max light. it's pretty tough
---
r/boneappletea lol
---
I promise you it isn‚Äôt and guns are not two taps except odd cases with Luna‚Äôs
---
You need to have completed the enemy of my enemy quest line on titan (you‚Äôll know if you‚Äôve completed it if you have the exotic quest for rat king) and then there‚Äôs plenty of explanation on YouTube cuz the quest is rather complicated. FYI you‚Äôll need to be 690 power and have a fireteam of three of you want to complete zero hour unless you learn the path and are a pve god.
---

Its ok i still love titans a band of hunters made me make this meme lol

I don't need porn today.
---
Which is true
---
I've seen so many lol
---
The goth kid everyone picks on
---
getting the outbreak required no grinding at all, you didn't need to farm resources to build a key each time you want to run the mission, you do the missions leading up to it and can jump straight in.
---
compare it to all the other exotic "quests" like thorn (10 kills with the appropriate weapon= 1%), malfeasance (bank motes to progress, lose double the motes you die holding from current progress), the last word (kill/assist +1% death -1%)
---
that's some grind right there.
---
no you didnt.
---
I choose the Nine, but why is Hawkmoon paired with them?
---
^Uldren ^and ^his ^barons ^would ^fit ^right ^in
---
Oh I see, and I guess it mostly feels like they are, sec, gonna downvote myself too
---
Although the ones I see can actually hit me but they never go for headshots so I constantly outshoot them.
---
They kind of just spam the weapon as fast as they can
---
Do you want proof?
---
yep
---
100% true. Take the upvote.
---
My favorite scene from that show btw
---
The man of many dings
---
Cool. I ll do it
---
That's when you know. The one I see are on my team and they also happen to be featured in the "peaceful med berry".
---
Had one, its OK.  You're better off with a surrounded Mod.
---
All of the sides!
---
Touch of malice would break the entire game because of well of rediance.
---
like, flashpoints don‚Äôt even be showing up on my game no more its weird
---
Id stick with the PS4 version over the PC port for the bigger community, exclusive content and no cheaters.
---
Wow it looks exactly like it
---
Ye its true, level does not matter. Hell, even if now have the DLCs, i will always be a free game peasant. Will always use MIDA multi tool and Solemn Hymn (both base game weapons), and i have the highest stats of my clan, even if they go full meta and use handcannons lol.
---
Yeah, the annual pass has its ups and downs. But overall, it's better than having the nearly year long lack of new content like post - taken king. And I found the grinding doesn't seem to be as bad as others say, in 700 power on my hunter already, but I think I got there fast. Also fuck enhancement cores.
---
Ok
---
Being invisible doesn't change whether or not TR3-VR will go for you because he has a set path
---
because I enjoyed D1 more than you'll ever know, the sad state of the game, D2,  year 1 pushed me and my clans away, myself like MANY that are still here, have hope for D3, its simply too late and i'm uninterested in picking up a game and playing catch up, and dealing with people like you.
---
it was hard enough as a deaf gamer to know everything about every raid, to be able to do every phase and task, and still struggle to find LFG fire squads because all my friends stopped playing... its a lot more to do with it than simply "huh why are you here" pathetic attempt to be special, the stuff I did through the beta and the 3k+ hours I put into D1 and the 500 or so I put into D2 pretty much allows me to follow a game I adored at one point. 
---
so tell me kinderguardian, why are YOU here if not to attack others who asked a simple question.
---
Thank you!
---
would be a pretty interesting idea, it'd also be interesting to see a new exotic that allows armor of light to persist outside of the bubble as armor is kinda meh in d2.
---
Back when the tonic broke destiny, I put the sixth coyote on and went top tree tether and just went invisible and explored the entire dance room without the enemies attacking me
---
OKay you earned a block.
---
Video needs more MPEG.
---
I am on PC, and cannot speak for xbox, but the playerbase seems pretty lively, especially due to the introduction of a new quest last Tuesday. 
---
Even during the peak of new players going through Forsaken, I think it would be hard to find people just because it is generally easy to solo the story missions, so few people go out of their way to find other players. 
---
I think it is definitely worth playing.
---
My fastest duo is 30 sec on my successful run it's just the start of the bot is seemingly random and keeps going and sub 695 you can't really duo the boss with the tanks being a thing
---
Theres a pretty decent size playerbase. The DLC is pretty great.
---
Yeah this is 10/10 ridiculous and wrong.
---
While true, tell that to everybody whining about be matchmade in comp with level 20‚Äôs
---
Some Spider bounties can help you level up! don‚Äôt forget flashpoints, strikes, a crucible and gambit match for powerful gear ( etc etc ) ! 
---
Good luck on that grind, it‚Äôs way more refined now !
---
Its okay but as mentioned other exotics will be much more beneficial so there really is never a logical reason to use it ezcept maybe on like the snow map if all you. Do is use a void gun long range but even then lunas would probably help more
---
They were scared asf cuz they saw us beat the darkness itself, Trevor.
---
I've had absolutely no luck.
---
I've gotten 3 to drop after 150 Tier 2 runs on Oryx weeks.
---
The best I've gotten is Corkscrew Rifling, High Caliber Rounds, Threat Detector, Multi-Kill Clip, and a Handling MW.
---
Absolutely terrible.
---
The other 2 both dropped with Handling MWs and Hipfire Grip.
---
I may as well just go for Midnight Coup.
---
Good for you though.
---
Wtf is this shit?
---
Yup. I *definitely* haven‚Äôt wiffed a nova when it mattered most in comp ...
---
The E is nowhere near V. 
---
Chances are they typed pervected, since the F is close enough to the V and pervected will auto correct into perverted
---
Midnight coup is still fantastic. 
---
And i feel you dude...I‚Äôve done close to 900 tier 2 runs and have 2 really good rolls. RNG is a bitch.

Nice man. I have yet to get a Spare Rations to drop. I believe I‚Äôve gotten close to 20 pulse rifles though. I‚Äôd settle for a mediocre roll for now just so I can give it a try &amp; see if I want to dedicate more time to farming for one.

DTG is just a bit more of a serious sub and the mods reflt that.
