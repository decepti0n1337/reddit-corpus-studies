The Shader is sold from shax but requires you to have completed the Crucible: Challenges triump, The triump is to complete the 5 weekly crucible matches for 6 weeks (just 6 weeks doesnt need to be in a row) if you havent done that you still have 9 weeks to get it before the season ends :)
---
---
---
You have to wait until next week when the weekly bounty to upgrade your synthesizer is available again. 
---
.... you got me there bro. Just don't be that one guy don't use the no fun allowed tactic I may have acted really offensive because of a similar problem occurring in a raid where they insulted my friend and sorry 
---
Yeah, that's pretty good, but I still think the best dialogue is from when Ikora caught Cayde masturbating( or at least the exo equivalent).
---
Ok, just added you. Thanks m doing random stuff but if you want to get something going, let me know, just shoot me a message. I set my status to offline, but I'm usually on, playing, so not me whenever. 
---
Yea i wish that the year 1 gear would have some random rolls or atleast static rolls so that they arent useless compared to Year 2 armor
---
I plan on creating both Iâ€™m questioning wish to do first
---
He has another line "You're the reaper now"
---

---
Having come from 700+ hrs of Overwatch my first thought on hearing him was, well that's reaper and it bugs me constantly.
---
Tbh novelizations and such are legitimate. Writing a screenplay off something visual is actually a good skill to have, especially if you want to make a movie. Putting what you imagine onto paper is a neat skill
---
When doing a session be careful of tilting as it can hit harder then you might expect, what i ususally do is i play untill i have lost twice and then take a break to reduce tilting and anger that might come from the blueberries (unless its the first 2 matches)
---
Except you can kill them then come back by the time they recouperate
---
Hey man, a bit late to your post but also in Italy, and also having cabbage stuffed down my throat. Did you ever end up with a new router and did it solve your problem?
---
But aren't there four bounties to do? I mean I'll wait til next week, but damn. That's stupid
---
Honestly I don't even find it slow. It one shots any red bar and most baseline yellows on a headshot with the explosive rounds. I'm very rarely shooting the same target more than once - if it can take more than one boe shot from NTB, two at the most, I'm going to be swapping to another weapon anyways.
---
It's just perfectly timed with my aim adjustments. I'm drawing as I move to another target and can release the second I'm on it. Dramatically lowering the draw time really wouldn't do much for me most of the time, since that eight of a second is the time it takes me to aquire my next target. It's perfect.
---
In Crucible it's another story; most bows are a two shot regardless of head or body shots, so you can use whatever you like. I stick with NTB when I need s non-exotic kinetic bow just because im familiar with it, but any will realistically work. 
---
What I do now is, I'll play the weekly required matches on all characters (win or lose) and I'll keep playing on the one I did best on (I have all classes) and if I start losing, I just take a long break
---
Yes, there are. But only one of them gives the synthesizer upgrade. Iâ€™m in the same boat. I agree that itâ€™s frustrating but they have to put some measures in place so we donâ€™t blow through content I guess 
---
Thanks
---
xD
---
Found this in volundr and every time i have goon by it i die. Has any one know about this or has scanned it.
---
Outbreak prime needs to come back
---
I use them in droves. To the point I'm putting them in the bank. (See above)
---
I collect far more than I require for anything. For either of Banshee or Ada, despite turning in regularly to both. My bottlenecks are in much more difficult places than gunsmith materials.
---
So to answer your question, no? I love spending my tokens. And do so often. And because I don't need extra mats beyond the GSMs to give to Banshee, he probably sees me more than Ada does in terms of depositing these - though Ada obviously has more activity from me, due to bounties and the like. 
---
He isn't very good at changing activities
---
U got ddossed lol 
---
One of these days one eyed mask will be sold
---
Is anybody gonna mention the fact that he got this using such a wholesome loadout, not a single "meta" thing about it... mad respect man
---
I knew that sounded way too close to be q coincidence, I've got around 250-300 hours on overwatch and as a tank main reaper is the name of my existence
---
If it's not this it's something else though
---
Hit up banshee
---
Its BA
---
120 points. 
---
Well if heâ€™s anything like me he will double jump instantly miss the ledge,  die and quietly leave the the strike outta embarrassment......
---
I've had spectral last over 1:30, this was a 20 second clip
---
Skull from a Everything ... why get your super back immediately just for killing five enemyâ€™s.... bleh bleh bleh shut up quit crying 
---
I am sure they will bring them back ASAP. It impressed me how quickly they disabled it once theyâ€™ve been told it can be exploited. Therefore, I think itâ€™s high on their priority list. Also a good part of their players are now basically naked without perks, and that can not linger 
---
Do you have to do that puzzle in the bergusia..?
---
I wanna grind for a title but not dredgen cause that's lame af. But dont wanna do that f'ing puzzle lol
---
I heccin hope so, I'm soooo close to getting the Reckoner Title &gt;.&lt;
---
We were all running in a general direction and I guess they were just following the lead 
---
I'm still waiting for Alkane dust...
---
Hey...
---
Take me with you.
---
You're my hero, I must suck at this game ðŸ˜­
---
ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ noted   
---
No problem friendo!
---
Also make sure its Fabled in competative. Lots of people make the mistake of getting Fabled in Quickplay then having to start over. Competative Fabled is much harder.
---
Riskrunner is better don't @ me
---
Okay, now I want to grind really hard for one of those titles so I can get one of these. This is sick!!!! I reeeally want the Dredgen one, but I suck at Gambit. :( 
---
You will not miss anything. You'll just be a week behind everyone who did one each week. 
---
as a hunter, i fully agree with this. spectral blades has a ridiculously long duration with gwisin vest, even arc staff with raiden flux can't hold up to that duration, and golden gun lasts as long as a short fart in the wind (and on top of that can just get gunned down by primaries from behind without any resistance). nobody should be allowed to run around and collect like, 11 kills off a single super. honestly spectral blades shouldn't have armor at all for how much damage, mobility, and invisibility it has; i'm tired of running into teams where 4/6 of them are spectral blades. 
---
Hey thatâ€™s pretty good
---
This whole thread makes me super depressed to be a Warlock main in crucible at the moment. 
---
Makes sense
---
The triumph says strike playlist on it, and unfortunately only strikes in the strike playlist count. 
---
No clue, just didn't turn them in for awhile
---
I miss trials
---
"So would you jump off a cliff if your friends did?"
---
Do you get triumphs?
---
Lol I didn't even know this was a feature... thanks for the heads up though. 
---
Epic
---
 players will always complain something is op.  Nothing can stop that. 
---
Doesn't need a nerf at all. Requires utmost precision and is hardly meta
---
All of them. Cut off on store has been extended to August 30.
---
Target practice
---
Respect.
---
Too soon.
---
...
---
It will always be too soon.
---
Is it any good? Or should I avoid it for the sake of my own sanity? 
---
Until bungie announces an epic store exclusive
---
Or partners with EA
---
Yep
---
Is "Stupidity" one of this new exotic hand canons...?
---
Nah. Just rare.
---
I like it. I had a similar idea where if you get a kill with the hammer it would return like the knife precision kill but if you miss then it would work similarly to the thorn remnant and come back towards you within a certain distance.
---
I feel really bad now and I donâ€™t know why...
---
Fuuuuck. I know. 
---
Now that I finally beat it Iâ€™m more confident. Iâ€™m gonna give it a shot tomorrow. 
---
But still though, if this was one of the hardest things Iâ€™ve done in this game, doing it FLAWLESS? God damn lol. 
---
So many people today competing this, including me! 
---
Fuck yeah! Congrats man. Feels good doesnâ€™t it :D
---
Best and worse luck lmao 
---
I'm fucking dying because the structure is completely wrong
---
No Turning Back.
---
Yes. As of Forsaken, last September. 
---
Missed opportunity, this should have been one of those "Thanos Warlock can't hurt you" memes.
---
Remember Halo Grifball? Bungie did it all already.
---
All I'd say is that it's not just about using the radar. Find a gun that suits you. Pulse rifles are particularly good in Crucible. 
---
Ah didnâ€™t see that, thanks
---
I used to figure for a while but the radar helps with not getting blindsided or flanked. Beyond that it was alright. I suppose I donâ€™t have a feel for anything but handcannons but in crucible, it feels significantly different. 
---
Congrats again 
---
Happy upvote fishing comment!
---
ðŸ¤£
---
Itâ€™s the secret hard mode! Hope you enjoyed!
---
They're OP with physical phenomenon, but super weak to paracausal stuff. 
---
A quadriplegic Hellen Keller could get a team wipe with spectral  
---
I...AM...GARY
---
Donâ€™t forget the hitscan where they slash in front of you and you die before they reach you 
---
Hardlight
---
I played these guys! 
---
OP didnâ€™t think anyone would know!
---
Itâ€™s been tested, they have the highest defense, you can soak the melee without any real super loss, youâ€™re invisible and move faster than a run, and you can melee up to somebody in the air 
---
both the title, the gameplay, the editing and the audio gave me sorts of cancered that aren't even on medical record yet
---
That bouncing bullets gun? 100% sure not that one
---
#relatable 
---
Men love soccer (worldwide not US), more viewership means more money. You want the women to make more money buy their jerseys, attend their games, and watch their matches on TV. Millions watch men's soccer and I believe billions when it comes to the World Cup. 
---
But did you get the ship for the Cursebreaker title? 
---
Itâ€™s pretty good too if you can control the screen shake since there is 0 damage drop off
---
I got it first day of season 6, I missed the quest because I started the game just when the quest was over, I prayed for it every day until I got it.
---
The quest is coming back in arc week for those who dont have it 
---
Its called football
---
I guess, but even then that's mostly 3 exotics
---
nobody:
---
Burning Meme titans:
---
Be the change you want to see! 
---
9/10 gambit matches I find myself camping the bank and just melting blockers with my shotty. If at any time your team allows more than two blockers without hard switching to get rid of them, youâ€™re probably gonna lose unless you handle them yourself.
---
I'm more disgusted at the fact that no one joined
---
Tho the drifter offers power surge bounties that guarantee level 640 armor
---
The Binary Shrine?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
\*ADEPTUS MECHANICUS INTENSIFIES\*
---
Yes it's the taken version of it.
---
You get it by completing the whisper mission once. Then you get the heroic version of it. In there you open 5 chests and do a little oracle puzzle. After the puzzle you finally get the quest for it. After that you need to complete the whisper mission with each singe. It changes weekly. So....you need to complete it 3 times in 3 weeks. Ironically, the heroic version is much easier than the regular one.
---
Watch a guide if you want it. It takes no shaders btw.
---
I'm going to prime to try this. 
---
Oh wait, everyone is a sweaty 4 stack, nvm :(
---
Iâ€™ll do you one better! Wardcliff over whisper
---
When you wipe the enemy team on the first invade, come back and notice your team barely picked up any motes
---
Honestly avoid it, I kinda liked most of the first few season, but then came back to the show with season 2 and tried to rewatch it to find where I was, and just couldn't 
---
When people donâ€™t read this full screen info when booting up the game 
---
Could you imagine how great it would be if Shaxx did commentary for soccer games?
---
Iâ€™ve been playing Destiny 2 for a couple of months now and I have no idea what any of these words are or mean. 
---
Ummm, this is a map u can fin on google images from months ago 
---
I took the phrase in question to be another reference to Sword Logic. 
---
Orin has said that they are interested in the Drifter bc he is walking the same type of path as his "Father" Dredgen Yore. Being that hes making his own path and while others sheep along, prolly a reference to the mass of other "Guardians" just following the light like moths to a flame.
---
nah, drifter is calus 2.0, he wants to eat everything and 'grow fat from strength'
---
Not even downvoting because curious about reasoning. Also learn to count asshat. You missed one
---
Uh no
---
This is why I love most of this community 
---
After all this time, I have finally found the purpose of the cake.
---
Ha catchy! Love it 
---
Olive branch in one hand, dagger in the other.
---
that would be pretty broken, with the new bullets refill with a kill you could get unilmited supers 
---
Titans: Am I a joke to you?
---
Dammit itâ€™s for Xbox!!! 
---
Its purely visual. 
---
Anyone who demands that you switch off full choke is either misinformed or doesn't know better.
---
Found this old capture and relived the stress. Those 7 motes barely survived 6 blockers and 2 invaders. 
---
Exactly. That's what warlocks do. I literally ended a strike with 30 kills because of a warlock this Skull of Dire Ahamkara. He had 60 super kills and 128 total kills at the end...
---
Lol Titans need a boss melter
---
PASS Time?
---
I was the guy who stayed... 
---
If you want skill based matchmaking, comp is right there. 
---
Is the blight easier to kill on the third phase?
---
Really found the Pulse on that joke didn't ya
---
r/phalanxed
---
I thought he was waiting for all of them to get choose, and then using a heavy weapon or super to kill them all, which has been done in crucible often
---
Lol bro you're delusional
---
I spent an entire game trying to high-five the enemy team and you absolutely can emote with enemies.
---
That blueberrie blocking your deposit was painful
---
if you want dps...celestial should almost 2 shot it no?...and if you have recluse ads are a non-issue
---
Don't go into it with this mindset. 4 stacks aren't always an immediate loss, not all teams are the most coordinated. If you view it as an opportunity to get better against stacks it makes solo queueing a far more enjoyable experience.
---
Being a blueberry isn't the problem though.
---
I might try this
---
6.9.0.0.0.01
---
Nah celesti doesnt even do a bar
---
I love that one guy who just desperately tried to solo the primeval while his team abandoned him.
---
Economic realities are, well, real, no doubt about it. However, US Soccer is a not-for-profit with the goal of promoting all USA Soccer, not just the most profitable segments. The extraordinary pay disparities seemed to say that a decent showing by a menâ€™s team was more important than supporting a fantastic womenâ€™s team. Economic realities almost always supersede fairness as you point out. 
---
One of my favorite weapons in the game, you can actually hip fire it consistently.
---
Yes but this is gambito, the mexican version.
---
That's not Perfect Paradox
---
I would love to! 
---
Same. I love invading. My friends tell me to just go play crucible but itâ€™s not as satisfying as wiping the guy with 15 motes. 
---
All right it wasnâ€™t suppose to turn into an argument forum it was suppose to be a funny meme (my bad for turning it into something else)
---
Shotgun noob.
---
Use tractor cannon and celestial, it does more damage. 
---
Now go do it flawless.
---
Year 1 drops come from Rahool and year 1 activities. Do leviathan underbelly chests, public events, old adventures, etc.
---
Heroic events: difficult because noobs. 
---
I feel like they need to introduce a tutorial thing because honestly its ruining the experience 
---
That's what happens in games oriented for mature casuals.
---
I feel like the real lesson here is that Telesto is the besto.
---
Another proof that competitive mode in this game is a complete trash can. Hit your 2100 and avoid it like a plague.
---
I still have them too. Just didnt use them yet. 
---
This not what we meant by ONE MAN ARMY ðŸ˜‚
---
He saved them before planetary activities stopped giving tokens, they still have value at the specified vendor (i think).
---
Just like doing a variety of stuff I guess.
---
Well that gives me something to consider then.
---
Thank you.
---
I've been seeing it a lot in rumble lately. Been having a blast with dance parties and the like
---
I've 500 or more of each, it's a part of the problem if bungie add new items to vendors- we'll just turn in all the stuff we've horded and say there's no content. 
---
[removed]
---
Judgey little clouds of matter arenâ€™t they? ðŸ˜‚
---
If Titans were made immune to boss stomps, will their boss damage increase?
---
Yup, being invaded 9th time is a totally common thing when you did not even summon a privemal.   
---
Cool story.  
---
"meat scepter" .....
---
doctor downvote doctor downvote!
---
Damn, I love relevant and timely content
---
It has its fun moments.
---
To be honest it has a lot of potential, its just bungo cant seem to manage building it up.
---
They make a good change and three bad ones.
---
Then two months later they fix two of the mistakes, make three more and get rid of the last improvement.
---
It makes no sense and its just a cluster fuck of " why would i want to do that" now.
---
*Slap*
---
*Gunshot* AHAHAHAHAHA
---
He did give them to you.
---
What's the point? It was a gameplay of ANY other sniper rifle. You did not even use Izanagi's signature perk, which means that you effectively wasted a slot for useful perks such as opening shot or snapshot sights.
---
Your running destiny 2 (2017) itâ€™s not really cpu/gpu intensive, if you want intensive then run Battlefield v with rtx in 4K on ultra 
---
I get that, but honestly it feels a lot more fair with blackout and the rest, my opinion obviously but I was breezing though Reckoning tier 3 with blackout but couldn't win once with prism 
---
I like the digital art Pooh panels, nice fresh touch 
---
Dude you're gonna have to make some kind of official event on a calendar app or something and really blow it up--I guarantee a good group of Guardians will go for it!
---
LOL, "Surprise mother fucker!"
---
Ah yes, Fisto, my favourite in the Protectron line! 
---
Theres no knights in this encounter?
---
Its good but not a god roll...
---
Rifled barrel or full choke + accurized rounds + snapshot sights + rambage (when proced rambage increases your range not just damage) and range masterwork... Those are the perks to look for in any shotty slideshot is also good
---
You should go for reckoner
---
Have some on pc from when the base game was free.  Didnâ€™t play again til Forsaken on pc so I still have them
---
Crap my bad.. 3am here lol... I still use tether in this encounter with darci
---
Iâ€™ve had this happen, where we won then after the game ended they got 2 kills then somehow actually won. Rip my streak. 
---
Looks great, how'd you make it 
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/sTZ1Ihm I made one transparent too!
---
Any oh his bounties that states you get a legendary drop from.. 
---
I really dig it! Might have to steal it for my void hunter! (Solar has Trials Cloak and I cannot unequip it.)
---
Just go play Rocket League for an hour. Not every moment of your gaming life has to be spent on Destiny 2. Although, that seems to be the idea for everyone still playing.
---
Nah its normal.. You get 3 or 4 days of exotics rqin.. Then 2 to 3 months of dry season
---
