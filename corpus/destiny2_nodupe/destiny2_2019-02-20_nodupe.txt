Get tired of these "I'm better than everyone and my teammates are trash" posts. If dude wasn't such a tool he may have a few friends to play with and remedy his problem.

Mine is my Side mouse button.

Nah I was just exaggerating. The charge is negligible tho for those that know how to use it. It’s just like other fusion weapons and bows. You charge, strafe away from cover and release. People get kills with jotunn until the opponents realize they have it. It’s still dirty on objectives like control tho.
---
I was going to rib you, but instead I'll go against my better judgement and actually comment. 
---

---
Right off the bat I'd say that reaction speed/aiming and map knowledge are skills. Skills that are developed through practice and repetition. So, those things would actually make you better at the game. 
---
Also, as a team-based mode of a multiplayer game, teamwork and coordination with communication are skillsets in and of themselves. This example rears it's head in solo queue especially. The lone wolf will most of the time be beaten by a communicating, coordinated fireteam. 
---
Right there you have four skills that are learned and practiced that set people above the rest. Even with the large margin of error that P2P provides. 
---
Thanks m8
---
So you are getting beat in pvp and decided to cry about it
---
You will just get the DLC's
---
I like you, definitely a better personality than the other mods on here. Thanks for being active 
---
You don't respond either, I'm still waiting 
---
Whats the spider bounty mean, arnt they there all the time??!??!
---
Lets break down all of your points. 
---
&gt; You do understand, that this game is a P2P game, and that no matter what  you do, aside from cheating and network manipulation, your results, in  the cruicible are solely based on randomness. Right? 
---
Completely untrue. I rarely have connection problems with this game. Most people have minimal, if any, connection problems. Your ping probably just sucks and youre butthurt about it.
---
&gt; here's reaction time and aiming, we got it and most people understand  this, you're not a special snnowflake, but in the end, if the game wont  register/count your shots vs the individual you're facing, It doesn't  matter what you do. 
---
Also complete bullshit. Once again, your ping likely just sucks, and thats on you, not the community.
---
&gt; My point in all this rambling, is, you're not that good, your success is  based largely on who you are matched with, and then how shitty your  connection is to the host. Im tired of going 30 KD/A games in Control,  with 5+ captures, only to lose cause my team is ass 
---
Getting paired with a shitty team is a problem that plagues every team based PVP game to ever exist. Stop whining about it.
---
&gt; or more importantly, there's the one guy on the other team you cant  kill, or, no one can kill, cause shots don't register, or, your shotgun  blast disappears into thin air, I.E., all of the above. 
---
Once again, sounds like a you problem and youre just projecting on everyone else. Shotguns have short range and aiming with them can be difficult until you get better at it over time.
---
&gt; There's no one, in this game that ive played against thqat I thought,m  wow that dude is legions above the rest skill-wise, because reality, it  boils down to connection to the host in a P2P system. 
---
Literally this entire post is you rambling about how shit your connection is, but no, its bungo's fault "muh p2p, muh shitty team pairing" Just get better at the game dude, and get a better internet connection if youre struggling with playing pvp. This game is incredibly skill based and what loadout you choose and how you choose to use it makes a huge impact on your success.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Yes he is
---
Alright stream whatever it is that happens haha
---
Would love to, he won't even respond though. What a joke
---
&gt;PSA: To the people who think they're actually good at this game... You do understand, that this game is a P2P game, and that no matter what you do, aside from cheating and network manipulation, your results, in the cruicible are solely based on randomness. Right? 
---
Wait for it.
---
&gt;Im tired of going 30 KD/A games in Control, with 5+ captures, only to lose cause my team is ass, or more importantly, there's the one guy on the other team you cant kill, or, no one can kill, cause shots don't register, or, your shotgun blast disappears into thin air...
---
30 kda? Proof please. Also,  you just said it was random and not your skill, so be thankful that you get paired up against as many afk people as you do.
---
&gt;I mean, yes, there's a certain level of map knowledge you must know. There's reaction time and aiming, 
---
Both definitely things that are all random and have nothing to do with skill
---
&gt;...but in the end, if the game wont register/count your shots vs the individual you're facing
---
It's probably you that had a shirt connection then, have you tried turning your router off then back on?
---
&gt;...the game will match you with sub par players...
---
Errm, now comment.
---
&gt;You don't know until you're 3-5 minutes into match what you're working with, in regards to teammates, but you find out eventually. 
---
Yeah, that's how match making works, duh
---
&gt;...you're not that good, your success is based largely on who you are matched with, and then how shitty your connection is to the host. 
---
Right? Cuz accuracy, confidence with load out, map awareness, super selection, super timing, and knowing how to defend heavy are not skill based.
---
&gt;I seriously urge, anyone, to prove me wrong. Legit. I don't think its possible.
---
Burden of proof is on the individual making the claim
---
Are you dodging near enemies? The dodge perk only works when you are in close proximity to enemies. Use the Spathe all the time, always works for me.

FFS I am appalled that everything in this game is based on RNG.

I think you’d like A Parcel of Stardust, it’s lightweight so it doesn’t have *insane* range, but it can roll full choke, accurized rounds and opening shot. I’ve gotten a decent amount with Opening Shot actually

Hammerhead *is* the LMG fyi, happy farming Light-bearer
---
Would The Long Goodbye work?
---
Well, we *did* ask for random rolls(perks that rely purely on RNG)
---
I don't recall anyone asking for that. I recall the community asking for the ability to have different perks on guns.
---
Bungie took it a step further and made them random, because being able to build or reroll your perks takes too much of the slot machine out of their game.
---
.63 lifetime kd and 52 years old and i am past the pvp parts. Most anyone should be able to get it if they work at it. Crimson days helped me but i could have got it in iron banner too I am sure. My kd goes up to about .85 in ib  and, more importantly for this quest, my kda  goes up to about 1.25
---
I’ve always had this idea: we could reroll guns from our collections. It would take the grind out of the game somewhat, but it would still be relatively expensive
---
GG! I really like this!
---
I’ve started the grind for Luna’s and I feel like the comp playlist has more diverse game types 
---
Was fun while it lasted

Day one patch for anthem fixes almost everything. It's just pre release. Give it a little bit of time.

I feel the same way. I think it has made me a bit better player too. I am more likely to disengage when i am low on health now. Rather than just fighting it out and losing most times.

Nice. Don’t make it too restrictive, but we do need something. Thank you!

Why not... drop pods full of bombs?

Do you have the 2-shot or the 6-shot version of the acrius?

Me and the boys played some quick play one night to get our bounties taken care of, and we ended up played Clash, Control, Survival, and Countdown like four games in a row and we had a BLAST. The different game modes really kept us satisfied.

Then one gets two tapped by a handcannon from across the map, lol.

yeah but i dont have friends, soooooo....

You tried that's all that matters

Not when you genuinely don't find a fundamentally broken game mode fun.
---
SHOW ME WHATS DESTINY IS ALL ABOUT

That there meme is making me miss Destiny a good bit I tell you what.
---
Exotics, Supers, and Titan Skating.
---
I mean it’s fair enough that you don’t find it fun, I get that, it’s your opinion:) . I just don’t understand why it’s “broken”, then again this is only the 2nd FPS I have over 500 hours on, so my judgment might be off?
---
Guess they got the drop on you.
---
That and from my experiences with how Bioware handles feedback. In the old Mass Effect 3 multiplayer days they were lile clockwork fixing bugs, buffing classes, adding new classes for free and adding more difficulties as well as make tje extended cut.
---
And Anthem has had a lot of fixes made already. Bioware has fixed the bad flying controls from the alpha and have fixed bugs in less than a week since it openned access in the 15th.
---
Something that, no ofense intended, would take a month or two for Bungie to fix, even a minor bug.
---
I saw this and immediately thought of bloons tower defense.
---
What events? Can you link me some. I live under a rock. 
---
I've played Destiny 2 so much that I can't even watch people play it anymore. It has literally become the most boring fucking game to me and it sucks because no other game that is out rn really catches my attention.

I know they'll like it, but I have to work with their attention span. 😂 And I'M the one with ADD!

My arguments still stand as they are facts whenever the two games are brought into any sort of comparison. Plus destiny will never be "killed" as they still provide the best available form of "end game content" known as raids (we all know cataclysms in anthem wont be as grandiose) as well as the first person perspective and focus on the game playing as an fps first and rpg second. Anthem has taken a different direction going with rpg first, shooting second direction...different players will migrate to their preferred style of playing.
---
Anthem is Diablo.
---
It even has the "inferno" modes equivalents with its "Grandmaster" modes.  Abilities as well as weapons can drop as Legendaries, all of which have RNG stats that facilitate "chasing builds" exactly like Diablo.
---
Destiny doesnt support anything like that. There is no RNG stats with Exotics, nor do they come with amy stats that cooperate with ither weapons or abilities, unless thats a specific behavior of its exotic ability.
---
Destinys loot pool involves chasing guns and armor pieces that CAN be exceptionally similar when comparing the worst roll to the god roll of the perks/stats they drop with.
---
Its just not the same game.  Its all gameplay rather than the loot.  If Destiny, like the community wanted, broke into a bit more MMO RPG and Diablo loot table.... it would blow everyone away.
---
*Imagine a "rare" blue drop of the Golden Gun super, then theres an "Legendary" and then "Exotic" version.  All of these containing RNG stats for us to create builds with.*
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but is that not kill clip AND rampage?
---
Im excited for the division 2
---
I loved year 1 d1 :P
---
I'm pretty surely I could. Because he's me
---
Just play whatever you find the most fun. Games pretty much a cakewalk. I'd probably play warlock for best survivability.less time spent hiding behind a wall to heal.
---
OEM titans are great in crucible but there's a 'nerf' coming 'soon' for that
---
  
---
Overall I'd say class balance is fairly even when looking at supers with maybe hunters sneaking out a small lead
---
Isn't Anthem crushing it? Both are games from companies I'd never buy though these days but still. 
---
Yep, the classic good bone structure/minuet 42 combo.
---
But spectral is like 65%
---
Also the only thing that needs to be done about Luna and forgotten is to make them into exotic weapons and that should fix the problem.
---
45 second spectral blades, one and done shutdown blade barrage for hunters. OEM for titans is nasty. Warlocks have chaos reach (situational) and the dawnblade is good. Dont use nova warp whatever you do.
---
Bungie didn't learn from d1, and they're doing their best to not learn anything from d2. Better get ready for d3 and another season pass before the end of the year!
---
For pve I'd say warlocks right now, with nova bomb and skull, or well as needed. The other classes are both great as well. For pvp I'd say titan and hunter are neck and neck.
---
It was a great $20 game that cost $60
---
Destiny offers quite some variety in armor models and weapons types while Anthem offers barely any (which Im baffled by). In time this might change but as it is now Im not impressed. 
---
Annual pass is basically just buying 3 dlcs at once.
---
I’d say pop a super but then your team mates will steal your motes 
---
For me, im just horrible at PvP in general. I dont do alot of gaming, so I always get annihilated when I attempt them. Being so terrible at it, and knowing ur bringing your teammates down makes it not fun for me. 
---
Have you read the patch notes for day 1 patch? It's not going to fix the content issues.
---
I've had this issue when helping people with the quest, the only option is to do a fresh run of the entire shattered throne. Hope this helps!
---
All year 2 armor including the eververse vanity armour have perks. You must be referring to year 1 armour  
---
Destiny’s annual pass is a bit different to other games “pass” type content.
---
Anything released during the annual pass timeframe is yours. Any quest or end game activity is yours. You own it. 
---
The pass gives you everything inside this season, next season, and the one after that. Anything released in those seasons becomes yours forever if you buy it, the pass doesn’t run out.
---
There is a fair amount of content within it, but released slowly. I’ll find a picture of the roadmap to link in an edit.
---
The early access is pretty much the launch version. And no one is comparing it to the current state of D2, it falls short of both iterations of Destiny as they were at launch, by a wide margin.
---
It's not even out yet and we have 3 different sets for each and a fourth floor the colossus and ranger. There may be a lot of armor choices in destiny but it's also been out going on 2 years, and even then half the armor looks like shit and the other half is useless. The only 2 sets worth anything are the raid set from last wish and the dreaming city. Those are the only 2 that can come with the enhanced perks.
---
Do you mean the open space of Mercury?  Because there are definitely Mercury maps.  
---
Open-World Mercury would be fun if you're a sniper though.
---
They know of it though so it's likely getting fixed, all we for was what someone leaked. Even then it might be fixed already. 
---
I dont think it has to be 3 in a season (could be wrong though)
---
They said that they were looking into doing a double/triple infamy week/weekend before the end of the season.
---
So basically next week. 
---
Why would folk downvote your comment? Take this upvote good Sir
---
Thank you kindly, just bought it!
---
Destiny is the least twitch-shooter PvP experience though, with TTK so high you can actually get shot and start shooting back with a chance to duel and win unlike most other PvP shooters out there.
---
It’s still shit, what do you mean?
---
Pretty sure they have openly said that this isn't happening. You can infuse old stuff up to current power levels, but no new perks or anything. Maybe something with mods, but no intrinsic perks.
---
Considering the fact that everything is reskinned anyway, probably shouldn't be a big deal.
---
Nice! What platform you on? 
---
I’ve recently switched to hunter and need to redo all the Black Armoury stuff, if you want someone to help you out every now and then.

That damn mask is so frustrating, even in 1v1 scenarios (where most of the advantages dont apply) when you get them to 1hp just to see them get full life (and freakin overshield) again.

Its a good subclass and instead of being visible like blade from d1 it can go invisible.
---
Hence the voidy boi and invisible boi.
---
[removed]
---
Awesome! I gladly take you up on that offer, im on pc
---
It is possible. I\`m a solo player and I need just one reset for the gun.
---
I agree, this does seem possible.
---
Ahw daaamn :(
---
Pretty sure the reason is that they keep trying to rebalance their game every sixish months.
---
I've been playing since 6 weeks after D1's realease, but have hiatused myself for the last couple months because my girlfriend and brother bought me a Switch. I have literal months of game time in both games.
---
There's a whole essay worth of stuff I could go into, but basically to me it seems like a complete disconnect from the initial development team and the live team. Development team has little to no connection to the player base. They create a game that they don't even play based on their own misguided perceptions. Live team speands months and years correcting.
---
Going back to the original point, live team makes stuff better, but bringing old stuff forward brings up balance issues or even just, "It's way easier to phase stuff out than integrate it."
---
I didn’t blink at all and still missed it lol
---
Shit. Meant to reply to your comment. My reply is to the original post.
---
Strikes if youre good can take less, but pvp is guaranteed in 10 minutes.
---
That sounds absolutely awesome not going to lie. I wasn’t too sure on Warlock going off last night when I first started, however once I got into the swing of things and started to unlock more of the solar abilities it was fun flying around dawnblading Fallen. 
---
Guess it really depends on how comfortable you are with 110 HC's. For some reason in PVP, I can only make the 110 archetype work for me. They seem to be the only ones I can hit consistent headshots with. My accuracy with most other types of HC's is usually way off or at the least, very inconsistent. That said, I only use it for PVP. For most other tasks, there are much better suited HC's. That's just me though.
---
I'd use it more often if it was stronger :(
---
The way I feel D2 is losing the playerbase even if Anthem is a complete failure...  people is definitely not hyped for JW... anyway i hope Anthem can thrive so Bungie can wake up again and get back on track, forsaken was so great but the annual pass is weak
---
Move, the tracking is not really good
---
destiny will live on. forever! 
---
THIS IS WHAT LOVE LOOKS LIKE!
---
Nova Warp was stupid OP in crucible on Day 1 of Forsaken and it took them almost 5 months to address it. And after 4-5 months of working on a fix they just say “fuck it” and break Nova Warp so it’s worthless.
---
I’m more concerned that nothing is being done about Dust Rock Blues, I see that more that any other weapon people talk about.
---
Look, reading isn’t the problem. Reading got me “more shots” like the rat king says “more rat kings more strength.” It’s vague. I was hoping someone had an exact number. I’ve already don’t my testing. Its 3. Without it’s 6, with its 9. Smartass.
---
Yeah, I was testing some new colors on this one
---
Well those people are fuckin idiots.
---
And so are the ones making the opposite claims about Destiny crushing Anthem.
---
Bold of you to assume it’s just new guardians doing it. Some people just want to see the whole world burn
---
And you're missing the part where they didn't say it was..... 
---
Yeah I noticed this too, I only got to play two days because I had to go out of town.  Day 1 was just nasty stepping all over duos and I felt great, Day 2 was stressful as hell.
---
&gt; but broadly speaking both are FPS games.
---
Explain to me how calling something a first-person shooter game isnt calling it a first-person shooter game.
---
If you have origin premier you got it 10 days early I think. 15$ a month in PC and gets you access to all.games on origin iirc 
---
Remember when D2 killed off the best character in the entire game(s)?
---
 Fuck, I missed Dinklebot
---
Same here, I love this game !

The game I played before Destiny had this weekly "WEDNESDAY RAGE THREAD" to blow off some steam. It turned toxicity in something funny.

It isn't going to be exotics but flawless execution
---
Yeah I know.some guys clearly have the knowledge but don't care. But I hope new guys can read it and get a clue. Have a nice day 
---
Speaking as someone who truly want anthem succeed because I believe competition is good: Anthem is disappointing.   
---
I'm not talking about bugs, those are kind of expected to be there ta launch. I mean the execution. We all say Destiny has an amazing lore but poor storytelling, Anthem also suffer from the same issue. I won't go into spoil territory, but the ending of the storyline was very anti-climatic. Have you ever watched that gif with the midget who is about to jump in a lake and instead of the normal splash sound all we get is a "plup"? Well, that's what we get from the conslusion of the vanilla Anthem storyline.   
---
Right now people are in the honeymoon with Anthem and most didnt finish the story . I had a clan mate who quit midway because his quest bugged and once we  figured a work-around, the next story mission bugged multiple times.   
---
Here I'm hoping that with the day 1 patch the game become at least playable, but honestly... if that's Bioware A-team, then they're in trouble.
---
This happened to me
---
LOUD
---
The meta has shifted to close range engagements for sure. The typical sweaty loadout is a shotgun and hand cannon. Dust rock blues, retold tale, wishbringer are all good shotguns. Hand cannons such as ace of spaces, the last word, kindled orchard and the competitive pinnacle weapons luna howl and not forgotten are very strong.
---
Pulses are also in a good spot right now, you'll want to look for a good roll on Bygones, Go Figure or Blast Furnace. Inaugural address still does well if you have that from Y1 raids.
---
Heavy weapons - wardcliff coil, heavy machine guns are strong st the moment (hammerhead is a forge LMG quite accessible). Otherwise GL or rockets always work.
---
Games are so different but people make shitty comparisons. 
---
JOTARO!
---
Great thanks 
---
Lets all make sure we dont hate on Anthem and its fan, unlike what they do to us.
---
We dont want to drop to their level
---
Ah I see we’ve come full circle ⭕️ 
---
Crutch
---
I feel like it should read Destiny had a rough start, people gave it hate, they fix it or ruin it or say they are listening. 
---
Destiny's first expansion had a rough start...
---
Destiny's second expansion...
---
Destiny 2 had a god awful start... 
---
Honestly I loved vanilla Destiny. There are parts I've enjoyed since then, but Destiny hasn't captured me except for moments since then. I've realized for me to still love the great moments I had in D1 I had to just walk away. Destiny will always be a work in progress and it hurts too much to see something you cared about relapse repeatedly. End it now and you can at least remember the good times fondly. 
---
You're correct. 
---
Do you think the meta will change in the next season?
---
Whew lad. He said that Halo and CS are FPS games. It was an example explaining genres. 
---
Hype died less than one month after launch? Just as expected
---
I call him Lord suxx because I dislike PvP
---
Hmm. Maybe I will give Anthem a try then.
---
Most of them (well, us I should say, though I wasn't as harsh on D2 until CoO plopped down like the wet fart it is). were coming over from D1 Year 3, a smorgasbord of polished content over three years that had all been finally brought into relevance.
---
So we had the story kind of rebooting itself, and still not really going anywhere (The Traveller has awoken and precisely d*** has come of that). The middle act actually seems like it got cut for time. D1 wasn't great or even good at communicating its story. But you had two planet long chapters, with a side story on each planet to do. Compared to like, 2 missions on most of D2's planets.
---
Half the class skill trees (and any kind of customization) vanished, armour stopped having perks. Shaders were consumables now to feed Eververse. The Raid was half complete garbage stuff that barely qualifies as an FPS with rewards goofy as all get (including more consumable shaders in lieu of actual loot). Cooldowns on everything were excessively long (probably at whatever their base rate was, but in D1 you could stack armour stats to boost them)
---
Not enough of a PvP guy to really comment on the Crucible, though it certainly felt less generally enjoyable.
---
Then some of the big hyped up changes were just underwhelming. Clans were supposed to be a big thing, but it was just some extra rewards for the usual busy work, and leveling up your clan was perks that literally no one cares about to this day (You can get a second blue item from a public event chest for maxing your clan rank, oh boy). Mods were lackluster in options, mostly being element switches, and you had to get the +5 light level ones to keep pace which were obnoxiously rare for kinetics. 
---
Weapons that were supposed to go in every slot and perform differently based on that turned into just having a second set of primaries hard locked into the energy slot, and previous utility weapons like sniper/shotty/fusion pushed into heavy (while by and large underperforming as heavies). For the new weapons, there were the Grenade Launchers, which aren't popular by any means, and SMG's which were effectively already in D1, just as an auto-rife archetype.
---
Yeah i agree with your sentence, but not your tag..... 
---
Anthem is more like warframe than anything else imo 
---
The last boss drops loot... it's just given to you after the dungeon on the loot screen.
---
Very common misconception 😁... which they're changing on Friday because of people like the streamer you watched assuming this.
---
I didn't think 700 power level was open yet...
---
To be fair. This isnt exactly true. Its only out for PC. We all know PC ganers fill these subs with an ungodly amount of whining. They whine about everything.  
---
I played anthem. Its good. 
---
Not sure if its better than destiny. We will see. If they make me farm the same strike over and over again for 6 months and get nothing like destiny then ill quit playing the same way i quit destiny 
---
What does look good is no pvp. Leave those toxic gamers in destiny please.
---
But REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE logical opinions and sound minded people.
---
No seriously, I wish all the people would just play what they wanted to play. I didn't particularily like anthem, I really don't mind if people do though. To each their own!
---
Good gun, but has too many better alternatives for me personally to use. A lot of the time a weapon (such as inaugural address) is on the same level but doesn’t use an exotic slot, meaning you can throw on wardcliff too for pvp 
---
What content issues. You are watching shitty streakers dude. Game has tons in it. Plus updates coming monthly.  What did destiny give in the last 6 months . An update for more guns to add to the 987 i have in my stash. And if i wanted to play the update,  i had to log in and grind 20 levels in old content. I love destiny, but dude. Come on
---
Always, until weekly reset
---
Yeah, it’s nuts
---
Congratulations!! 
---
After struggling enormously with the first PvP part of the quest, I actually managed to finish it very easily during the Crimson Days. I always thought more people in a game, like quick play, meant fewer were shooting at me, and couldn't understand why I was doing so poorly. After doing the Crimson Days twosome I realise it's all about the importance of team play.
---
So to short it out the dreaming city has a curse week and every 3 weeks it is strongest and that is when shattered throne cones up. You can also tell because of all the blights floating around and the little pieces of darkness in the air. Hope that sums  it up.
---
Doubt it, the factghat those triumphs dissapear after the event indicates a no.
---
Shotgun? Or sub machine ?
---
I have over 10k kills on my masterworked GL. It was god tier in the crucible at one point after its buff. I still enjoy using it during Void singe
---
Sorry what does lfg mean ??
---
Dealing with them isn’t necessarily the problem. It’s just the most annoying aspect of the game to either have an entire enemy team only using shotguns (which is pretty much all of iron banner right now), get chain headshots almost kill the fucker all the while they’re sprinting at you just to slide and one shot you in the foot with 1 hp left or almost kill a guy rush on him to finish him off and surprise shot gun. It doesn’t take any skill what so ever which is the point of having pvp. To test your skill against others. If I wanted to play unbalanced bullshit I’d go play call of duty. 
---
I hear a lot of hate coming from the D2 camp on Anthem but ya’ll are forgetting that D2 before Forsaken was a sack of shit in terms in end game and rewarding play. 
---
I quit playing D2 last January and the ONLY reason I came back to play was that they killed off my favourite character from the entire game series and I just had to see how it played out in campaign. Once you get the end game grind out though D2 is essentially a rinse and repeat waste of time. 
---
Yes you are probably right. Had to try shometing. Any tips?
---
Yeah, also happened to me on PS4 lol
---
I thought that playing csgo makes you drunk and Russian, not good at aiming. You never stop learning!
---
Take the shot before you *get* shot.
---
PvP tryhards
---
This, picked up forsaken a few weeks ago on ps4 and I feel like its 50/50 on whether the guardians doing a public event will try and end the event before i can make it heroic :(
---
Whats the name of that sparrow im looking for it since ages but can't seem to find it even in collection tab monkaHmm
---
You've peppered that guy, so i guess they got salty over that
---
Dealing with them isn’t the problem. The point is that it doesn’t take any skill at all to use a shotgun. Which the point of having pvp is to test your skills against others not find the most broken way possible to get kills. 
---
I always inform them in public text chat how to trigger if I get there early to grab the flag before it starts. Nearly everyone I've played with this past week made them heroic, I think only one group melted.
---
Never hurts to post what to do in text chat if you have time.
---
Sometimes it's stuff that makes sense. Like the bug with the shaders and mods and stuff. But other times its annoying. Either way, I either make a comment and move on or I just move on. 
---
Well there ARE a lot of people coming back to the game now that they know there's a ton more content then there was at release. I only came back a few months ago and didn't know about heroics until someone said something on here. Now I go for heroic every time.
---
Indeed, announcing Trial's is dead on the other hand...
---
Watch the whiny kids Cone in to complain about an armor piece
---
Well that's your biased opinion. You prefer Destiny over Anthem. Anthem is fun to a lot of it's players.
---
We can play two games, you know that right?
---
Real OG’s remember when Grav was OP
---
I love the grab. Aesthetically my favorite exotic.
---
Yea cus they both awful
---
Same onto you fellow wayfayer!
---
If you really like the game the cosmetics and dlc/annual pass won't bother you . Of the game bothers you and you don't enjoy it it will definitely an annoy you
---
I'm looking forward to giving Anthem a try, but after D2 I've learned to wait a really long time before I bother trying a game. D2 was god awful on release. I bought each DLC with much anticipation and was let down majorly.
---
Almost pre-ordered Fallout 76 but a friend convinced me to wait, so glad I listened.
---
It really doesn't.  D1 didn't have a coherent story, Anthem does.  D2 had so little content at launch, I rerolled my character 3 times in the 1st week to get those powerful rewards.
---
And a few set rolls on weapons of which a few were any good.
---
It's hard to even see it coming in fights.
---
Anthem had promise til you realise the endgame is *more* barebones than the original Destiny's pre dlc
---
I will say it's not as unquie of boss fights (big beast). Think of it as a dumbed down verison to appeal to more of the masses. I don't want to get your hopes up too much :) 
---
Context?
---
Just make sure you do all powerful frames in Bergusia. It drops both exotics and the drop rate is decent. Ive got 5 bows and 2 Jotunns in about 40 frames. 
---
Agreed but it still fills the role of looter-shooter and gives us an infinitely better pvp experience than destiny 2 ever has. For context, I love destiny and d2 and played hundreds of hours of both, been playing d2 non-stop since launch. Since Apex launched I have played ZERO hours of destiny 2. Lack of new story content is one thing but I think the last time I played crucible just for fun, as in not grinding for light levels or gear, was in destiny 1. Crucible is broken, no idea how they should fix it but it is not fun. I’m still going to hop on d2 when new story launches since I have the pass but they really gotta do something about pvp if they want to maintain a consistent player base with some of the new stuff coming out now.
---
Praise his name!
---
No, but seriously. Why is this stickied?
---
Goddamn Time Paradox
---
There are stories of people getting these with normal frames though. So it seems powerfull is not required 
---
With the roll i got, i couldnt refuse. It has snapshot moving target. 
---
I think if you preordered the game you got 10 hours to play it before it actually launched and within the 10 hours people were able to beat the campaign and every other endgame activity in the entire game 
---
Exactly this, I've seen some pretty bad comparisons in my time but this has to be the absolute worst! Anthem to me feels more like the Division but with Mech Suits.
---
&gt; If you change the damage buff that players get over time to instead a damage resistance buff the primeval has that DRAINS over time the one shot upon spawning is much more difficult.
---
Nope. Not unless you change the value. You are only inverting the modifier. 
---
&gt;say for the sake of the example the damage resistance starts at 75%) 75% LESS damage than it would have previously. It wouldn't die with those kind of modifiers from that attack early on.
---
What will happen is teams will simply wait a pre-ordained time till they mathematically know their damage meets the requirement. then nuke it. its "wait till 3 stacks" all over again. 
---
you wouldnt need to change how the modifier even works, if you wanted this example to work you could just give the primeval more base HP.
---
&gt;The problem is players are currently killing it without any damage buff 
---
This doesnt mean the damage buff needs to go away, only that perhaps the Prime needs more base HP. Changing the name / how the modifier works isnt going to change anything without changing the numbers. 
---
And to top it all off, simply making players wait till the nuke clock hits 0 isnt really changing the core problem either. because as soon as buff/debuff/muff hits a certain level it will get hit with the same shit.
---
We don't know if that is a simulation 
---
Not after this game specifically but I’ve received many.  
---
I feel attacked.
---
Story structure w/ interaction at home base, game play loop of missions and open world, big boss end game fights rely on damage output and weak point hits unless you want to be shooting forever, the open world environment has a very similar feel, gear grinding/crafting (although mods replace gear specific aspects of MH). There is also regrinding content as well but think that is very generic looter game. 
---
A few things I learnt:-
---
1. Use all of the mods you get from The Last wish raid. The taken armaments, taken barrier, taken invigoration etc. I found them very, very helpful.
---
2. I solo'd 100% of ST (not flawless) with well of radiance. 
---
3. Take your time to kill at range the ogres on the jumping narrow platforms. They will push you off if you are in range of them. (very annoying)
---
4. I had to 2 phase Vorgeth. I mainly used Subtle Calimity and Thunderlord. The extra grenade return from the mod Taken invigoration really helped with the healing nade returns. Use Subtle Calimity to get the wizards shields off and get them all low before attempting to kill all of them. (Vorgeth only took me 2 attempts but I was extra careful). Would strongly recommend watching a good youtube video on this encounter.
---
5. On final boss. I used Threat Level, Riskrunner &amp; Hammerhead. I found this worked very well. Riskrunner enables you to tank and put out a lot of damage.
---
This is what I learnt on my first attempt at Soloing Shattered Throne. It took me 3.5hours. 22 Deaths. The final boss caused me the most but once I changed to the loadout I described above it made it much easier.
---
Yeah i had a lot of masterwork cores to spare and it does make a difference in resilience a bit...surprisingly...
---
Flick of the wrist
---
When people asked them about raids they kept talking about "aspirational content" as the endgame and then they've stated that Cataclysms are that content.

Just curious, have you played both versions, friend?
---
Yes it's fine
---
Ricardo is the best guardian.
---
Psh as if, playing the objective? Being a skilled shot? These are obviously not the problems of a titan-skating, oem-relying, soft-skulled titan.

I have never had any trouble finding anyone in game, plenty of players. And to me, xbox's built-in LFG tool works so well that it's worth it to have it on this system. I needed to do Shattered Throne last night, hit the guide button, tab over to party tab, hit LFG, see post, click "I'm interested", dude invites me to party instantly, we jump in, do the dungeon in just a few minutes, wham-bam-thankyou-ma'am.
---
That’s so true.
---
Not everyone was playing at that time. For a lot of people, it's not a matter of missing an opportunity to get them, because they never had an opportunity in the first place.
---
Thunderlord is a power weapon. It is going to do work, especially in the right hands. What we really need to talk about it Jotunn, because fuck every coward who uses it.
---
Of course not! I just recommend the console I would play to get more people to play on ps servers.
---
I've played it from Warmind to Black Armory on Xbox and just recently switched to PC after I rebuilt my computer. The Xbox community for D2 is well populated for sure.
---
good to see him without OYM ... 
---
Don't worry, that's what GG is for on that encounter. At least you took care of your knight. When I'm on Hunter I run GG just to have a backup in case someone else has trouble. 
---
I got mine during the haunted forest event. It's very fun to use.
---
I got a titan exotic for the year 2 void super, lol
---
Shotgun, but shoots like an aggressive frame pulse rifle.
---
Yongyeah.
---
Anyone comparing the two games is a moron. They're fundamentally different in almost every way.
---
Played both Destiny’s quite a lot and IMO Anthem is already better then both not saying Destiny is crap it has its merits but Anthem already wins points on the ability to swap out of your “class” to use another when you like not being locked in is fun and allows more flexibility when playing. I know people will argue that Anthem is another Destiny in terms of its launch state and that’s totally valid and hopefully it expands into something better which doesn’t seem like it will be long to figure out they are supposed to be rolling new stuff out starting in March and its free which is always a bonus no one can really argue that both Destiny games had stupid initial “expansions” that were supremely lacklustre followed up by something that was actually worth it which should have bern the case immediately. But this is my take nothing more  
---
Shaxx keeps a hidden microphone in his helmet so he can be LOUD
---
How long has it been since you submitted a contact form?
---
Turn hdr off or adjust the brightness? 
---
They will be in the game eventually. I understand that not everyone had come around yet or just couldn't buy it, but I had played this game with no other friends because they had abandoned the game and i have these of a few things to show for it. Trust me, next season you will have the opportunity to obtain these illusive items.   
---
oh shit you found me out
---
We need MOAR mods and mod slots!
---
oo ursa furiosa, Thats probably the newest exotic with the most utility if not the most utility of the titan's class.
---
Haha. Fair enough!
---
TBF as a Hunter, I hate being on the receiving end of spectral blades too. I use Nightstalker top tree so I don't have to deal with people chasing me down.
---
If you wanna be a villain number 1
---
pAtheTIc AnD hYpOcRyTiCaL
---
i can guarantee getting slide shot by a titan with dust rock blues, luna's howl, and warcliff coil is much more annoying than being killed by spetral blades
---
also ^ no one uses ^ spectral blades
---
What Helmet is that?
---
To be honest it’s Apex that has killed Destiny for me, been playing since D1 Vanilla and I think a combination of the meta the money spent and general lack of anything exciting or interesting in the game has been pushing me away. Now that Apex has come out I don’t even remotely want to play which is a shame because I loved the universe and the lore and was a hardcore fan through thick and thin but it’s just not fun to me anymore it’s all the same guns getting used with next to no variety the maps are boring and the PVE side is complete trash in D2 with exception of Forsaken which was okay I guess but still didn’t really do it for me. Maybe D3 will bring me back if they don’t completely massacre it, that’s if it even happens. 
---
This is all my personal opinion which has been made over a long time, I think it just feels like a cash grab to me now with no real effort put in. 
---
Ps. I play on console 
---
Anthem could be amazing, and I dont think it would "kill" Destiny. 2 great games can exist at the same time.
---
Where is the rush? Just complete milestones that award powerful gear and you will catch up.
---
Getting spawntrapped by the same guy in his spectral is much worse imo and do people still not know how to counter apes?
---
I have enjoyed Anthem for what it is, similar to base D2. But I will keep going back to Destiny as I have really learned to enjoy Crucible after grinding for Redrix's Broadsword. 
---
Still need to do Scourge raid and I wanna do a few more runs of LW. That should hold me over well until Anthem improves more.
---
What? You can do 5 minutes
---
And that's the funny part
---
(It was joke BTW i have bo idea how big is either of their fanbase)
---
I can't remember the last time i was killed by spectral blades, and when you see them, just use like a queenbreaker to lock onto their head
---
Are you being serious? 
---
I'll help as well as laughing.
---
It's the Crucible armor.
---
Jesus. Anybody got a slowed down version?
---
I would kill for a Destiny 2 game-mode like Titanfall 2's Attrition.
---
Large map, AI-controlled mobs on both sides, persistent player presence. Like Gambit except you're always on the same map. 
---
In my opinion. It’s never too late! It’s a steady grind to max light. The forges take a bit of time to unlock, but not anything that can’t be done in a couple days, but they do have light requirements if you expect to help with kills. 
---
Nah  about 90% of the time there will be people with you no matter where you go. The only place not like this is certain PvP games modes but its pretty rare for me. Xbox  btw
---
mildly rekt to say the least
---
Watching this makes me want to get my dukes back out. 
---
For pve: outlaw/flared magwell or high cal/rampage
---
For PvP: range finder/alloy magazine or AP rounds/rampage. 
---
Unfortunately, didn’t get a range masterwork on either. 
---
Agreed. 
---
Considering there is a meme every other day about this, I don't think it's just you.
---
The wardiff coil for example! Honestly speaking, every class comes down to skill. I always thought titans were super op in comp, but after getting a titan characters, I can confirm that it's mostly skill even if they're using shotguns(I'm a shit pvp player). The same is true for exotics, sure the OEM marks your target but unless you can actually do anything to them, it's a waster exotic.
---
Sure, like you spawn with heavy :D
---
And spectral was just an example, once oem isnt the best titan exotic anymore, people will just find something else to use and complain about.
---
r/destinyfashion
---
Spoiler alert: the cooler Daniel is actually and asshole.
---
Wow this guy is so good pls succ my peen
---
Why
---
Both consoles run the game perfectly i dont understand why there is an argument concerning which is better
---
Sure, but the joke is “Destiny is so trash that it can’t be worse than Anthem.” So, Destiny is better than Anthem because Destiny is so trash. It makes no sense.
---
I got in the room before but u have to glitch the map

---
i’ve seen so many of these post. it pisses me off each time. no one even tries to do anything about it they just immediately resort to posting on reddit
---
Yeah I have 55 clears haha. My raid team has probably close to 300 total between the 6 of us so Petra's Run kinda just felt like any other run. You wouldn't want to die anyway in a normal run, right? Haha. 
---
Hey I'm a warlock and I bitch about OEM don't leave me out
---
Umm..  ok.
---
If the devs don't explain it in a proper way I don't know it exists 😀
---
yeah it’s got a really good pvp ttk as well it fun just impractical in the current meta
---
LeMonarque,Izanagi’s Burden and The Last Word plus the ones you mentioned are the rest of the kinetic exotics. 
---
Sure you can.
---
If you want a piece of the market you need to be better than the alternatives are, "The game has been out for a while" is a pretty shit excuse.
---
When people have to chose to play destiny 2 or anthem, they'll have the option between anthem release or destiny 2 year 2.
---
It's anthem's job to be better than destiny year 2. 
---
I thought Le Monarque was black armory restricted...
---
Those are all Black Armory exotics though
---
You have to chase a titan on the run. (Not that it's possible or anything.) 
---
I hope they make the thorn PvP steps much harder. That exotic bounty in d1 was the bane of my existence, but it was definitely worth it......
---
I've seen a lot of people with that, how do you get the halo?
---
No the bug is not fixed yet you have to do it on the character that got the quest. 
---
On PC, people use macros to Titan skate, which is a way of travelling abnormally fast.
---

---
True it's not a very good design on a lot of things in this game. But I love it anyway hehe.😅
---
Nice tap-click.
---
There’s gonna be a Year 3? (this is a genuine question) 
---
Ive done it on my hunter completed it the first week it was out and now I try and do it on my titan and the key mold won’t pop up. So I’ll have to wait till they fix that bug? 
---
No horn? No beautiful beautiful horn?
---
MY MY MY MY Mind, is too fast for eyes 
---
Think there is a two week timer in them 
---
While i am not a oem titan.. kinda over seeing shot gun sliding apes complain every two threads on here... better hope that titan doesnt slap a wall up. How many poor hunter supers have been foiled by that or an amazing ability damping grenade.
---
Gotta be faster on the draw there partner.
---
You’ve never opened terraria have you fucking loudest thing ever 
---
I called dibs 
---
I used to laser tag with the nickname "ERROR" so whenever I shot someone on their gun it would read "ERROR SHOT YOU" 
---
They would always call for the Marshall to take a look at their equiptment while I was racking up points
---
Happens to the best of us, but I couldn't help myself.
---
Add Riskrunner and go with pulse grenade. You can damage yourself with the grenade to proc Riskrunner and deal out even more arcy death. 
---
There’s also an exotic helmet that gives grenade energy on special weapon kills which goes nicely with it, as Riskrunner kills will give you the grenade back, to proc Riskrunner again and so on...
---
That's good to know that you can switch at the last second. I just decided to go for this seal when I just realized how close I was without even trying. I only need to win with all gambit weapons and kill invaders who have their super. I'm at 7/10. That one will probably take a while but everything else is done.
---
That slight super loadup gives people plenty of time to toss the nade at em
---
Warlocks know your pain, but mainly with d1 solar special, that would just be a waste, so glad we have dawnblade now.
---
Gotta be even faster partner.  It's a dangerous world out here.
---
for sure, but vs average players there's plenty of bad shotgun players that are easily baited, and if you are using a side arm you aren't dropping any special so hopefully the other team runs out.  I kinda got tired of playing the meta so lately I've been trying a bunch of other things and having way more success than I probably thought I would. 
---
I can't get used to the rapid fire shotguns in pvp always seem to fire one shot when I need two and two shots whenever I only needed one. Luckily I got a nice retold tale used that and bygones a lot last season. 
---
Yes.  Yes it is
---
That's Wing Contender, you get it from the crucible and from turning in tokens to Shaxx.
---
Then perish. /s

Which step are you on? The Nightfall step?

The first time that happened to me i happened to be playing with the surround on to give my ears some rest... i thought my dog was going to Kool-Aid-Man the house in reverse.
---
no, le monarque doesn't show up in collections until you already have it.
---
No, I believe it doesn't iirc. Both the malf and B.A. exotics do not count. 
---
It's like Jötunn, except instead of someone coming up behind you, and bodying you with a fireball, somebody comes up behind you, and bodies with that McDonald's WiFi.

*smiles in sexy af cloaks*
---
Even then, I think Last Word is still better in that role. Primary ammo, has an insane TTK close-range and has better mid-range than any sidearm. You give up the exotic slot, sure, but the heavy slot does not benefit as much from exotics, IMHO.

Rapid fire shotguns - absolutely a matter of preference. I prefer rapid-fire, but I can see how players with great mechanics will get better performance out of a slower shotgun with more range. I don't feel as consistent with them, so I prefer to risk wasting ammo.
---
Nice. Wonder what he was thinking?
---
This is so true...   i've seen several come back with their little army of one medal laughing hysterically at the meme boys and their QBs/Hammerheads
---
Some people just can’t resist 😂 
---
That was flawless . 
---
well it would be the whole fireteam except the one person. I've played games where this is a thing and it works. It also has to give reason. Team fotress has it and it works great. So a fireteam of 6 all 5 other people would have to vote yes. In gambit i can see 3 people vote for the 1. In comp same aspect. 
---
i approve of this idea
---
Oh yeah tell me about it I was playing gambit yesterday and I had one teammate that would not leave my side and he’d slide in and steal my motes 
---
The Annual Pass doesn't go away. You've got plenty of time to do anything you want before the Destiny 2 servers go offline. Hell, D1 servers are still running now.
---
As for leveling, make sure to use Fireteam Medallion consumable and do anything that rewards "Powerful Gear". Milestones, bounties, raid/dungeon, etc.
---
So in crucible he is both shotgun and shoulder rushing?
---
Wow, this was some heavy tips! So I should grenade myself and go crazy with riskrunner + Verity's Brow?
---
One Yeeted Mask?
---
Contraverse Hold Axion Bolts were pretty deadly as well
---
Shit vot me this time
---
Season 6 comes out March 5. Only thing going on is people grinding for Luna. 
---
Strikers in a nutshell
---
Platform? 
---
They wont have a system where two meatheads could be rude to someone. People would definitely abuse it to be jerks. I get what you are going for but the assholes would ruin it.
---
yeah. Just Foetracer with a full heal and an overshield.
---
At first I though that the joke was that the titan wasn’t using one eyed mask 
---
I didn't usually care when I was basically killing everything with sweet business but holy shit I'd love to pick up some of the motes that dropped because of my kills
---
I can see that happening. 
---
*THANOS TITAN*
---
*Laughs in Wing Contender Titan Mark*
---
Alright well thanks anyways man :) If i were to tweet to Luke Smith, you think by any chance he might be able to help me? XD
---
Lol skullfort is infinite shoulder bash
---
Tiinfoil hat time: bungie reduced the drop rate of OEM to near zero because they're going to nerf it in a month. 
---
I cant reliably get MM to work in forges unless its Bergusia on PC. 
---
Read this in the iron man 3 voice 
---
Well yes especially because you dont use it and... Ya know...its blue
---
I have no idea who that is, and I've never been to twitter. Sorry man.
---
I feel your pain I ran with my clan mate last night Bergusia and some strikes he gets god rolls and exotics I got shitty rolls and blues RnGsus isn’t a fair god. 
---
i main middle tree nightstalker and use spike nades to zone areas. best nade imo. also, try teamshotting more or sticking near cover. run a heavy like wardcliff to get enemies off zones. 
---
Actually, if you use dragons shadow you can switch your focus to reload your melee (smoke nade), since dragons shadow will already reload your weapons. That way you can get both charged. The perk also increases movement speed, not just handling.
---
But it goes with the “hunter look”.... I normally don’t like the knee pads but the shader makes it look dope. 
---
2 people in my raid group get 1k voices then im here with my 5 chattering bones 
---
Persuader is my go too
---
Nah can confirm, been Last Worded out of my super before it killed the titan. :( Also been shoulder bashed quite a fair amount of times. Thank the Bungie lords that getting killed in blade barrage doesn't use it unless the last set is thrown. The only time I have successfully panicked a titan skater with bash or shotty is if there was a rather decent amount of distance already. 
---
Mine dropped on my first bounty on day one of forsaken.. not a single exotic from Spider since 😂
---
I have tried this many times, and I've managed to be able to get at least 2 kills, p r o g r e s s.
---
Dreaming City
---
He's the creative director for Destiny, but yeah I got you man. Thanks tho
---
Mix mash of stuff, can post tomorrow
---
......so what was in your kinetic slot?
---
Congrats. Now expect salty messages whenever you pull it out in quickplay. 
---

After the buff. I dont know when that happened but it was after the buff you needed to wipe an entire team to get 50-60%. It was possibly a bug and wasnt giving the right amount, but yea. even wiping a team gave less than pre nerf Shards hitting 1 target.
---
I thought you where going to say bananas and their own feces but this was better . 
---
Don't use it in crucible but that is really bad especially since it works great in pve. 
---
8====&gt;
---
Does it handle as well as it did in D1?
---
Titan Scum
---
Where do you get it? 
---
I figured strikes worked like how you described Gambit.
---
So everybody here just forgot about warmind?
---
i mean there isn’t really any tips to give other than pick out your best gun and play defensively.other than that it’s just luck and skill 
---
Its bullshit. I think there's only one more throne week to get it before the pins arent available. Like, wtf? Ive done everything aside from get the ghost and ship. Its not skill holding me back from this rral life item, its RNG. Ive got 6 chances this week, and 9 on the last. 15 more drops for the ship. About the same for the ghost, give or take a few. Bungie should just make it grindable, or release a quest where you do shattered throne 3+ times on one character plus some other stuff like AC 5 times. Youd turn it in and get a special oracle offering, and the queen would give you the ship, sparrow, and ghost. But no. Bungie goes with rng. 
---
Shattered throne is harder than a nightfall. So why can i grind nightfalls but not ST?
---
Still makes my point that Warlocks constantly get the short end of the stick when it comes to PVP exotics
---
Choose bottom tree (six shots) 
---
If it is a OEM titan or someone with LH/NF
---
Yes
---
Shit, I looked up malfeasance online, and that brought me to look up The Last Word, and now I have another Hand Cannon need that will force me to do way too much PvP.
---
Agreed , I honestly don’t understand why they implemented the throne the way they did . Hell even if it had been a once a day thing . I would do it every day . The fact that after three runs , I basically have to accept that I can’t try again for another 3 weeks is what kills me .
---
Looks like you gave em hell, Guardian! 
---
what chest armor is that?
---
Exactly. Its a game centered around a grind, but you arent allowed to grind 
---
yeah but starting a game at 5v3 is a bit much isn't it? it was so 1 sided it was hilarious, more guardians only got added when the score was 55 to 23. lost cause by then
---
Let me get this straight, when you were killed by a servitor, it was when you were with 650 level players? 
---
The strikes/nightfalls players are able to launch depend on their own levels. So for example, base game players can only launch nightfalls where the enemies are all power level 270. Meanwhile, players with Forsaken can only launch nightfalls where all enemies are power level 540. I don't know the exact number for strikes, unfortunately. 
---
that is my question 
---
No
---
Doesn't the whisper dungeon take place in one of the lost sectors which in turn leads further underground until your under the Pyramidion?
---
No. The servitor kill me, and it's recommended level was 622, while I was with the sub-20 players. 
---
I'm pretty sure it was a straight up strike.
---
Idk, but someone went out of the map and saw that it’s actually right where he’s looking. It makes sense if u read the Xol lore
---
