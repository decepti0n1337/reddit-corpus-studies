Is that normal melee range for a Titan!? Can hunters punch that far!?
---
---
---
Bullshit
---
I am still living that struggle man. Cant wait to be you
---
I cut out all the parts where they killed me. Getting that clip under a minute was super tight 
---
Surrender to the Vex. Resistance is futile. 
---
Top tree sentinel with synthos. You heal with every melee kill, a melee kill with a full melee ability gives overshield, overshield gives a melee damage buff, and being surrounded with synthos gives a melee damage buff. It's riddiculously fun and stupid. 
---
I just want to get the Harbinger's Echo sparrow, not sure if it is only obtainable from destroying the eggs. 
---
Seraph Rounds isn't really good enough to be useful. And the Hand Cannon still reloads way too slow even with Enhanced Loader.
---

---
Not only that but the Sniper Rifle is entirely useless. Triple Tap requires quick successive precision hits. Box Breathing requires waiting for about 4 seconds between every shot. So you can never have both perks up at once. A Box Breathing Twilight Oath beats it out by having better reload and a better second roll, and 90 or 72 RPM snipers are better in general.
---
Seems like they're basically just unlockables for the Collections and (besides the Shotgun) only semi useful in the time between Warmind and Forsaken for new playthroughs. Meanwhile the Shotgun is still the best Energy shotgun in the game and it leaves me wondering why the rest are still irrelevant. 
---
I'm still waiting on combo shells for most of the planets. I've got like, 3? that work for DC. Way too fucking many Crucible shells.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Nessus? Titan? Io? Fuck all that. Find your resources like a schmuck. 
---
Are you sure it disappeared?  The name of the quest and the way the quest looks is different for each step of the quest.  If you talked to the drifter after you received the seething heart quest you should have one now that is requiring you to kill taken bosses.  The third step is to do a special corrupted strike (level 580).  The next step is bank motes and the final step is guardian kills.  Look for a quest line in your pursuits that requires one of those steps.
---
It's a webm
---
Thanks! Yep I have an [Etsy Shop](https://etsy.me/2IY01yS) 
---
Dunemarchers. You can get to the enemy faster to punch them all.
---
r/raidsecrets probably knows
---
Haha sniping bros
---
I'm missing only "The heart of innermost light" and have every exotic on my other two classes. This week I got 4 Y1 weapons, and Hallowfire heart. Last week it was all Y1 weapons. At this point, I think Bungie is just trolling me.
---
Honestly I don't know what it is about this game but there's something about it that makes helping others so satisfying.
---
The best players absolutely could not beat players that earned NF legit with blues/greens that's just not happening because the primary you use matters almost as much as player skill in D2.
---
If you used Ace over Duke (lol btw) You would 100% be winning more engagements because Duke is a joke of a gun.
---
You say you can come up with 5 methods but you only brought up one, which i do agree with.
---
But that doesn't affect matchmaking which is what we were talking about and if they did split up based on ranks even more then they already do you would be waiting in queues forever and then that's what you would be complaining about instead of this.
---
Just play the game and get better then them just like they did they had to go through the same thing you are right now to get the gun and they got rewarded for it.
---
Made my dayüòÇüëå
---
Lol, well I just got that one you need a couple days ago and honestly don't ever see myself using it.  I'm convinced this game doesn't give you what you actually want.
---
That's a lot of effort for fake Internet points
---
If oem isnt working properly then all hope for balance is lost its already the strongest titan exotic if its meant to be greater there would be even more uproar to nerf also im unaware of the ursa nerf what was it?
---
Ight cool
---
Youd be surprised how often ppl do it tho. 
---
So does this mean the whisper is solar this week as well??  I've been waiting on arc for a minute..
---
That's awesome! Once he joined my crucible match...
---
on the same team as me. He racked up kills very quickly lol.
---
If u don‚Äôt take him out as soon as he spawns be very careful about ur damage or that happened (it sucks especially when it is on solar or void singe)
---
Getting some Red Hood vibes
---
It‚Äôs full dreaming city armor with the taken effect being caused by a tincture of queensfoil
---
Yeah it's just weird that my levelling isn't happening at the same rate as my gear is getting higher light level. This is my second character.
---
&gt;As long as all 5 resets are in the same season the quest step is retroactive. Sometimes it won‚Äôt recognize completion right away though so you‚Äôll have to go to the tower and back to orbit to get the completion
---
thanks man that is really comforting lol.
---
Same here. Tried it solo twice, does to the dumbest things that were random. LFG‚Äôd via the app a group that wasn‚Äôt even using mics. Painless.
---
Hehe oops ;) 
---
I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôve since discovered you can lock gear by pressing ‚ÄúShift‚Äù to prevent that sort of thing from happening?
---
Run! DUNNNDUNDUNDUNDUN
---
All I ever play is rumble i love it 
---
You are right, it means nothing 
---
I'd love to get this....or even the Luna. Sadly I suck at PVP and just really hate playing it :(
---
I downloaded it when it was free, so I was hoping to see other players who were at the same power level as me. Nope, not even once.
---
Go eat ice cream u deserve it A+++
---
Ouch
---
Not at all, easier on console
---
its https://www.twitch.tv/0kmmr_panda_bear I mostly stream to try and find more people to play with. I've pretty much been playing alone since the game came out
---
I was around 1.5K/D in D1. It's been on a downward spiral ever since. I don't think I'm positive on any of my three toons.
---
It gives you better version of foetracer when you are taking damage making it impossible to chase a titan if he disengage and very easy for him to push you if you disengage. How stupid can you be to just ignore that? It's a great exotic with marked for vengeance alone.
---
I'd be impressed except you are Titan skating with a macro so I'm disgusted instead.
---
Cool
---
I know i absolutely could have, but I tend to get shut down a lot. I try to be careful when I do decide to invade. 
---
I've gotten matched up with datto in trials it was amazing until he smashed us lol.
---
24:02
---
Why so negative ? 
---
I just go balls to the wall once I pick a semi sneaky approach. Due to the abysmal lag and situational awareness I can usually pull off a kill or 2 before they even know I'm there it's laughable. 
---
That‚Äôs what they said about D1 and 2....D2 doesn‚Äôt need an overhaul.
---
I literally have this same exact roll but a different sight haha. It's insane but I also want to get one with feeding frenzy/rampage to compare.
---
Zen Moment/Headseeker here, I love that thing
---
The chode 
---
Bigger explosion!
---
They increased the power level for all forsaken owners though. You don't need black armory to reach PL 650.
---
Why are you still at 500? I got to 560 in a week of getting Forsaken
---
I liked Cayde but The Drifter is my favorite. I even quote him at the office, my coworkers don't get it but they still look at me like it make total sense haha.
---
Someones been praying hard. 
---
With Breakneck you'd become a human Gatling Gun
---
alright alright alright let‚Äôs see what we‚Äôre fighting today, vex on the horizon 
---

You are not getting better, you just looted the One Eyed Mask.
---
I once got matched with evolvedjedi in a crucible match, dude stomped my team
---
Got the awesome hand cannon first time!
---
Cam is the best youtuber, you cannot change my mind.
---
That looks like the magic card progenitus
---
Pvp is honestly the worst part of most games which have it. 
---
Port back to the zone spawn point, and run back in (works on PS4) 
---
Downvoted for answering the question? Harsh realm.

Very....but congrats! It has it's uses in Taken Areas/Gambit.
---
Honestly, I would just start it. If your not confident you can do a round by yourself, put in a level 2. I've found that once you start it, it match makes more people pretty quickly into your instance. I don't hunt for a instance anymore, just go in and start a three. 
---
No drop mag so it takes longer to reload lol, I haven't had much time to play with it.
---
I always find staring an instance helps. Next thing you know people start showing up.
---
Do this in LW in the wish wall room all the time
---
That's a big yikes
---
I wish foetracer was viable, yeah tracking is G but the extra damage only procs when the opponent is low health and marked
---
Ah a man of culture
---
Woah.
---
NO. SHOOT. 
---
ONLY

They should have had Mathew voice the Drifter.
---
That's because it is! Good eye.
---
Scorn on the field.
---
What I‚Äôve been doing every time I go into the well is Hug the right wall like my life depends on it, and it works every time! Right before you go into the well it slips Left &amp; Right then you go around the corner and you see the marker for the well. Take the right lane, go all the way down that small hall then hug that wall until you go around the corner and see the marker and you should start seeing others there. It looks weird but it works for me. I‚Äôve walked in with out doing that and nothing, went back out tried this and then a team of four were there. So I don‚Äôt know if that glitch Bungie talked about is this there for some including myself.
---
Drifter without context.

(just making a joke)

Yeah not much ammo on a sniper to begin with. I actually love bows for sniping in D2. Especially the kenitic one that doesn't take an exotic slot
---
Just got this today. Only one more armor piece to go. Sixth coyote here I come
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/nevertellmetheodds

This works everytime for me too
---
It is only obtainable through destroying all 40 eggs. There‚Äôs some good trackers out there for ya though 
---
Congrats man! Keep it up. 
---
Check yourself out on DestinyTracker if you're interested in digging deeper into your stats. You can see your ELO, your pure KD, all kinds of stuff there. 
---
Fun fact: pull out your ghost and press down on the d-pad (if console), and it will  tell you what the modifiers are.

Hey I saw you in Crucible a couple days ago!
---
I‚Äôll keep playing maybe the next roll will have those 
---
Just like matchmaking for Archon's Forge in D1, crouch-walk outside the Well entrance as you approach. 
---
I just started the game was on a cliff top and saw some wires and thought well that‚Äôs a path for sure...... it wasn‚Äôt. 
---
Well I don‚Äôt have NF but I do have Luna and what I can tell you is Luna is great if you can hit your headshots consistently but its biggest weakness is it‚Äôs range. NF remedies this problem by having more range

Guiding Light
---
I myself once I got the neon helix shell literally scrapped all my others and wasted 8000 bright dust to replace them with neon helix since I couldnt stand how ugly as fuck the other guiding light shells are and that other effects dont do anything of worth
---
Temba! His arms wide!
---
How do you get neon helix? Is it from this season?
---
Oh 100%
---
Didn‚Äôt play for a couple of weeks as my wife and I were moving into our first home, start D2, first strike I get Crimson. Been playing every day since then, nada.

Maybe it‚Äôs a grower, not a shower

Not 305 anymore because there are no more plus 5 mods.

There‚Äôs no such thing as ‚Äúone single thrail‚Äù
---
**Bank** üëèüèΩ **those** üëèüèΩ **motes** üëèüèΩ
---
It‚Äôs because not enough guardians play crucible. Crucible is comprised of the sweatiest 1% of players and when new players/players that don‚Äôt regular play PvP they are reminded normally in the first match why the don‚Äôt play the pvp. 
---
Doing crucible for powerful gear felt like torture to me until I gave in and played the meta, shotgun ape/shoulder charge/telesto/etc 
---
Now while still not good I at least have a chance when I play my 5 matches a week. 
---
if doing the same emote and having no possible way in game to communicate is all it take to make you please.... man oh man are you in for a surprise if you play some other games that let you emote and way way way way way way more
---
I'd like there to be a little more traveling to activities. No matter how large a gameworld is, it can never really feel big when you don't have to spend any time traversing it.
---
O O F 
---
Sadly there are services like this for most games. Nothing can really be done about it.
---
Destiny sometimes doesn't like alt-tabbing on my system either. But it's very quick to alt-enter between windowed and fullscreen. So I usually just hit alt-enter, alt-tab over to whatever I want to look at, then alt-tab back to Destiny and alt-enter it back to fullscreen.
---
Hans... get ze L√ºger!
---
Whatever. You‚Äôre a troll. Later trash bag. 
---
Eystein-D. It was a little hard to find it because I recorded this clip a really long time ago, but I went back and checked in collections. 
---
Team up and you'll have it done within a couple minutes. It‚Äôs not that hard. 
---
go to task manager and try to maximize d2 through it
---
How do u get this quest via shaxx?
---
&gt; You won‚Äôt be able to go places you‚Äôre not a high enough level for.
---
What do you mean? I remember being able to go to everywhere on edz when i was lv 5 or so. And there are places where mobs just one shot you.

what shader is he using?

MeleeOnlyTitan is that you?
---
Luna‚Äôs has drop mag and stability masterwork, NF has accurized rounds and range masterwork. Basically trade faster reload and a bit more stability for way more range. It‚Äôs totally worth it though. Enhanced handcannon loader arms solve the reload issue and Luna‚Äôs only real downside is you have to always be close to mid range. Pretty much any other weapon will win at any kind of distance. 
---
Telesto, wallhacks(skills, armor, weapons), being pretty good with sniper rifles in close combat, supers. 
---
Might look up the Nordic alphabet and see if I can figure it out while at work tomorrow
---
Vex on the field 
---
If you're going to be tabbing out a lot, run the game in borderless window/"windowed fullscreen".
---
Can‚Äôt you delete the weapon and reacquire  it from your collections?
---
Scourge raid gear
---
Dismantle a weapon that has it.
---
An update a few months ago changed how gun damage worked. [Here are the details](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/9ctrjl/update_20_damage_comparison_for_shielded_and/). 
---
for those who asked/are curious about what weapon im using in the vid. it's Eystein-D. 
---
Nope. The data was transferred just before destiny 2 launched and isn't updated retrospectivly
---
Um.. not to be rude but no shit... thats how you keep your player base. Give em goodies in the beginning, they start grinding days at a time: give them shit, they quit for a week, come back and get exotic after first gambit
---
I respect your suffering bro üôåüí™
---
You have a chance to get the shader each time you dismantle a weapon with that shader applied. 
---
Play a different game in the meantime
---
Great. Just great
---
I haven‚Äôt played the start of the game since year one. So maybe your experience differs greatly from mine. I never encountered any basic enemies immune to damage unless it was a gameplay mechanic for a mission or event. The ad gets a shield, you blow something up, the ad loses said shield.
---
I dont get why people like crimson i used it and 3 round burst HC??? Doesn‚Äôt compute with me. I think it sucks tbh but people seem to like it
---
You see a lot of those ‚Äúone single thralls‚Äù when blackout is on 
---
I stand corrected
---
I agree. I went on holidays for a week. Come back and I‚Äôve gotten great roll after great roll. It‚Äôs been crazy
---
how many drops did you get befor you got the shotgun? i got it as my first drop xD
---
Dude I used to screw around in crucible so much so my kd was trash it took so long to get it back up above 1
---
Actually my eff in qp is all over the place sometimes i get 3, 2 or 1 or even lower 
---
Alright, thanks.
---
Yep. Kind of sucks, but it goes on sale often so you won‚Äôt have to burn a huge hole in your wallet if you decide to buy it.
---
I am 38, I got the game in November and 3 weeks after, I cried also at the beginning of the story. (Still Did do something yesterday when I did it the 3rd time)
---
But seriously, if he does something like me, I would check on him, he might be a little bit in depression (that‚Äôs what I am going through) 
---
Nothing bad but still worth talking with him and play with him. 
---
But still, it‚Äôs only an advice 
---
You can tell him that somebody tells him ‚ÄúWelcome to the club of those who cried for Cayde-6‚Äù and ‚ÄúEnjoy the game‚Äù
---
Whenever I have free time I am in the crucible playing quick play or rumble 
---
Tincture of queensfoil. Random drop in the world loot pool that has a max stack of 5 and is in your consumables tab. If you don't  have any you can farm for them by doing anything in dreaming city that drops loot or buy them from ahe ahamkara skull for 50 of the purple dreaming city consumables. The skull is in the room at the end of last weeks petra mission and is the one on the right.
---
Maybe you'll like it a bit more.  
---
My advice - don't set your expectations too high. I might even suggest you keep them as low as possible.
---
You're right, stormtrance is not great for killing bosses. You can use the smaller creatures as food for the crown though, kill small enemies with stormtrance or a grenade to get Induction Times x 3, extending the duration of stormtrance significantly, and go for the boss. You probably won't melt it but it will be damaged and attacking it usually zaps some of the adds keeping that Induction Times nice and high during the duration of the super. 
---
Ever since Thunderlord was released I use that to finish bosses. It just fits so well with the rest of the stormcaller. 
---
True that this stat does show how good I am and tbh I am trash but I am getting better 
---
Today I got it first try. But this is my 37th completion
---
Yep, and never used it. Vanilla 1000 disappointments looks better imo.
---
Your Team sucks...
---
Always great motivation.
---
damn
---
I still domt really understand what the weird thing hanging off the end of the barrel is. I know legitimately nothing about guns so thats probably why.
---
I got destiny 2 forsaken with ps+, but do I need to buy the previous 2 dlcs in order to play forsaken?
---
Truth. 
---
BOI, you haven't gotten your back cracked by a TAKEN phalanx. Boop boop motherfucker.
---
Real talk though, OK the playlist has problems but you‚Äôll never improve without an open minded attitude towards playing the game in the state it‚Äôs in.
---
I need hazard of the cast and the ghost and I‚Äôm done, hopefully I‚Äôll get that auto rifle in the next two resets haha
---
In a past life, I had 1.29 there... then I started the Luna's Howl quest. I was "forced" to use hand cannons, a type of weapon I genuinely dislike (alright I like Sunshot in PvE but that's the exception to the rule) and am not very good with. My Kda dropped to around 1.04 then. I'm sure my teammates in competitive have uttered some strong language about my performance. It still hurts to see I haven't been able to get back to the old numbers, but it takes a lot of games now to get those numbers to increase just a little. 
---
The jump
---
Literally one goddamn mistep or a slip and there's almost no way to save yourself 
---
Made it to the end of the AC (well i think it was) with the small ass round platform after my 5th attempt 
---
Then a damn phalanx breathed in my direction
---
Thanks 
---
Never thought of malfeasance...gd idea. Think I have to check the spawn points on each map. I have to learn where they come in and where to hide best...
---
Just keep playing the game, more or less any exotic drop will forward the quest (apparently not Xur's engrams tho).  
---
My son got his quest forwarded by a catalyst drop, just the other day.
---
Are you bringing back trials because I would like to go flawless and now that I have a good team I think ime ready to do it 
---
Same thing happened to me last name. Just before a strike I told my FT "Man, I need the Two failed fox". 
---
*Finishes strike*
---
*Two failed fox drops*
---
Lol. 
---
I was grinding out the 3rd reset while doing mine so it wasnt too bad. If i was only playing to get super kills though i think id get super frustrated. Good luck man
---
Research weapons frames and Blue Weapons frames are the same thing, aren't they?
---
Im making new characters and not having them done forsaken just so cayde stays there.F
---
Really ruins my gambit chrome, or atleast the leather and coin could be colorable 
---
Im bit of a Duke collector. I have one with range finder, ricochet rounds and rampage with a range masterwork...its a beast. However, ive retired this in favour of a god rolled wardens law.
---
Remember that malfeasance does extra damage to invaders. And if you stack enough slugs they all explode for even more damage. As long as you can get a flank, and they're not focused on you you can shred an invading super ez.
---
Gg. How much did u pay Kappa
---
There is a pretty broad cross-section of Team Fortress 2 and Destiny 2 memes. Considering I've played both games over 1500 hours in my life it's pretty refreshing.
---
Damn. I didn‚Äôt pick that up. Is there any other way to get it?
---
That is the most ridiculous luck ever! Saying that though, hadn't played my Warlock in a few weeks, signed in and started doing strikes. My daily strike drop was Geomags and the Risk Runner catalyst.
---
Seriously congratulations!!! 
---
Iron Banner is also not paid content. If I'm not wrong. 
---
Cabal on the field!
---
In case your not already doing it: Rotate your characters. Use 1, do all the daily bountes, swap to another do those bouties, then the third. Doing that and the weekly on all 3 dudes will net you an extra 2k+ infamy per week plus you'll be getting gear for your alts too.
---
If your gonna try the whole "save your super" for the invader kills i mentioned, use Dawnblade for the lock over nova warp. Warps better for pvp but with dawn blade you can just hover above them raining down fire instead up up close taking hits
---
Well you paid for the game, and is part of his content.
---
Also who wants to go to the roster every 2 seconds? I wanna have a number in the top right/left corner where I'm used to have one. Also the bar is really bad, how do I know if I just have 100 ping or 3000 when the bar is probably caped somewhere, also if it's capped at let's say 1000 it's really inaccurate.
---
Tell him to get rid of drop mag unless he never wants to have ammo. 
---
Although lag is annoying its going to always be an issue. I don‚Äôt believe should be banned for not having amazing internet. Maybe some people cant afford better internet. 
---
Smol chong*
---
No, that‚Äôs actually pretty crazy. ‚ÄòGrats 
---
Could be that he did the 5 resets in the last season but that would still be a bug
---
That's the ascendance effect from drinking a tincture of queensfoil while wearing the dreaming city armor.
---
thank you
---
Yep thats how it is in comp atm. I grinded luna's in like 8 days, got to 2050 and then waited for reset cuz im a bitch but now I have it. I will never go back until the mmr / matchmaking system is fixed. It takes around 30 min\~ for 1 round as I was evading 4 stacks by leaving the queue, it's literally impossible to do without.
---
Who Cakes?
---
I sometimes do, normally try to ask someone who already has the dredgen title. We knew the pain of trying to get that done.
---
Also its usually easier to get them to do it if you're on the losing team. It's like giving you a consolation gift for losing.
---
"anyone" (but only with a 1.2kd) lol
---
It takes lots of practice, at my best I was 1.82, but I took a break and got rusty. Now I'm down to 1.7, 
---
That HC would be much better with outlaw
---
Umm, I'm using Skull of Amkhara and it returns a shitload of super energy. In fact, often times it will completely refill my super. You just need to make sure you use the super properly. You have to get as many kills with it as possible. 
---
At 0 glory I seem to get infinite NF opponents. Pass. I am not the one to ask to not leave, you should ask bung to make MM better.
---
Why am I getting downvoted?  Im not lying.
---
So what you're saying is rng is random.
---
I would say the same, if your XB1, I'll help you get through too.  After a while, you will see that they are not really that bad.  
---
 Call the Praxic Order! Call the Thanatonauts! The Gensym Scribes! Call EVERYONE - so they can witness you!

If you aren't on xbox, what class are you? Maybe I could make some suggestions to help.

Also, I saw you said you have EP shotgun, do you also have the Tractor Cannon by chance?

Hopefully, whatever a radiance is will make it better.

It's not my fault sealed ahamkara grasps loos so cool
---
To this day I have yet to know what those three words actually are...
---
I was using them before the oathkeeper and tbh, reload on melee is alright
---
I like using them for the speed. Especially with skating, but when it comes to exotics I want damage buffs. However Dunemarchers seems like they could synergize with Striker really nice.
---

Between the three of us, I'm sure we can get OP through it some time when he's online!

Could actually be pretty cool, tbh 
---
Couple of tips.
---
1) Use control glide if there are tons of awkward jumps. Use burst glide for speed, best for parts with easier jumps.

2) Transversive steps will help.
---
3) Get your mobility to ~5+. You can get it to 9 with Steps and the Year 1 crucible armour from collections.
---
4) A sword can really help. I use it all the time for glitches, it can cancel your momentum or even give you a burst of momentum in mid-air. Takes practice but it's a useful movement tool if you know how to use it.
---
5) Dawnblades have top tree for Icarus Dash. This gives you a mid-air dodge which can be extremely useful.
---
6) ***MIDA Multitool*** - super useful for movement speed. Honestly a god send for some situations.
---
7) Taken Mod that gives you %20 damage resistance against Taken. Can't remember it's name but really helps with these challanges.
---
8) Drink a Red Bull or a coffee before doing it. Do a quick strike to practice first.
---
That's all I have. Good hunting guardian!
---
Thanks man and I am having fun learning these tactics and strategies 
---
I think he means more of 1v1 duel where it is strictly gun skill 
---
You're right though, it would help the 1v1 if you're peak shooting, or waiting for your target to leave cover 
---
Using an exotic armor piece because it‚Äôs your highest level piece ü§î
---
I thought I was the only omg 
---
"one Titan class has a one hit kill melee" FALSE. They have a one hit shoulder charge. That was not used in this clip. 
---
Zavala uses Ward of Dawn and Smash Striker. Ikora seems at home in the void class.
---
Just wait until you get to the last step.  All you have to do is kill Kill KILL, and the catharsis is MAGNIFICENT
---
Return from lunch:
---
‚ÄúYOUR INVADER IS BACK WITH THREE KILLS!‚Äù
---
It bothers me that your friend didn't say "Hive! Bring a sword" 
---
Nice of you that you took a screenshot the same moment the 2 second super ready popped up
---
I love the skull, really hoping they do something to return Nova Bombs to glory. I hate that it‚Äôs outclassed in every way by Blade Barrage
---
I was able to complete it, it just took awhile. My mistake was trying to do it during Iron Banner and just generally being terrible at PvP.
---
As it turns out, just rolling up on better players and frantically shooting at them is a poor strategy..
---
I know you can do it with the right fireteam, I will say having a Well of Radiance Warlock with Phoenix Protocol really helps a lot at the lower levels, also since you don't have a TC try to find a Titan with Melting Point or Hunter with Tether for the boss.
---
I would highly recommend trying an LFG like r/fireteams or the Destiny Companion App for the first few times. Once you get a machine gun and level up a little it will become much easier and a lot more fun, now that I'm up to 650 it's not so much of a challenge even when solo queued into matchmaking, just a pretty good time. 
---
You mentioned that you are staying in the caves which is good, once the boss spawns I've found the best spot to be is in the small cave/arch opposite the caves. Enemies won't spawn behind you and there's good cover over there.
---
What class and loadout are you running?
---
Holy shit that was so fun. Even without ophidia, 3 stack PWF recharged my knives *instantly*.
---
A build for under 1k can run everything at high/medium for many years. 
---
My old one worked 7 years before I noticed that more power would be nice and it did not have the best, most expensive parts build in. You don't need an i7 or 2080ti to run games at 60/144 FPS.
---
And you need a PC anyways.
---
No need to pay monthly for multiplayer and games are often a bit cheaper. But the the first buy is more expensive that's right.
---
I had a X-Box 360 and after switching to PC I never looked back.
---
I've been ground stomped this way before
---
Yes, save that Thunderlord ammo for the end if you can. And make sure to hit a public event banner on your way to the forge so you have full ammo/super!
---
I do believe next week is for the shotgun...as opposed to this week which is all weapons. 
---
Not looking for points at all the question was about the synergies between Oathkeeper and LeMonarque
---
Are you moving your highest-level weapons to your lower-level characters when playing them? That yanks their light level up really quickly, but I've known so many people who just did the grind completely separately on all 3.
---
Ha I got le monarch on my 3rd volundr forge run and then got oathkeepers from an engram my first gofannon run. It's a fun combo
---
Fuck them. 
---
I don't have the whisper.
---
BB or chaos reach plus Thunderlord are enough to melt the boss on the first forge
---
*Drifter jumps into the action*
---
DOUBLE KILL
---
*Rahool sneaks in*
---
TRIPLE KILL
---
Why I use vesper of radiance^^
---
Very frequently. Sometimes it will be me and then immediately say two other people have joined but they don‚Äôt spawn in until it‚Äôs over. Sometimes it‚Äôs just me and one other person and no third ever shows up. The matchmaking for forges is pretty garbage.
---
What shader do you like? Sunrise warrior makes it all hot pink
---
It took me two runs by myself before I got the jumping puzzle down, and I watched a youtube walkthrough while I did it. Luckily my third time running it I had found some other players to sherpa me through it so they almost had killed the boss by the time I made to the end.
---
Or a cracked put bird my clan has taken to calling it ‚Äúcrack eyes nighthawk‚Äù
---
It's not ranked. It's Competitive. ELO means nothing to your matchmaking. (Wheeeee 99% chances to loose!)
---
You walk in into the throne room on max curse week and see him and mara going at it.
---
Your eyes lock with her.
---
Then you hear shax:
---
Eyes up guradian
---
a wise man once said "it's hard to rob someone if they dont carry cash, and your team sucks do better"
---
So am I to understand this can be acquired after the Luna's quest?  
---
Um, hard pass. 
---
[whereisxur.com](https://whereisxur.com)
---
Lol honestly the hardest part of the quest was resisting the urge to load out a shotgun, so I went dual HC, Duke MK.44 and Trust. My god was that a sweaty, quasi-futile experience. Crucible gives me anxiety, but AoS is totally worth it. It‚Äôs easily one of the best guns in the game and the hit box is ludicrously forgiving.
---
I am still struggling with the item names since there are so many but thanks for the advice - now I will know what to look out for :) 
---
I am actually very pleasantly surprised by the community in Destiny. So many helpful people! It is quite refreshing!
---
Wish I could find some guardians like you
---
Weird I'm the opposite. Not a fan of the look but with the enhanced targeting head piece I get some ridiculous kills in crucible. I just swap between malfeasance and trust to keep the buff up
---
Yeah I‚Äôm sure it does, meanwhile bottom tree GG is arguably the worst subclass tree in the game, it has no synergy, and it‚Äôs perk ‚Äúpractice makes perfect‚Äù which is supposed to give extra super energy for a while after hitting precision hits and the perk and the perk ‚Äúline em up‚Äù is useless in pvp I don‚Äôt need more damage on a one shot super
---
That's a nice sniper for PvP. I kinda want one TBH. I have one with Box Breathing and it's hella convenient for PvE, but I need one for PvP too now. Grats on both of those!!
---
You fucking for real right now?
---
Show
---
I've only had it happen on xbox once, players spawned in when there was 8 seconds left on the timer. But then we just loaded into the next one.
---
I was a bit too good, so I took a break.
---
That's a super nice roll. That's what I'm hoping to get eventually. 
---
I'm trying, it's hard when you can only put in a few hours a week of gameplay though :(
---
The OG leviathan hunter helmet is one of the best looking helmets in the game imo I really like the prestige version because of the purple glow it gives off which pairs well with the solstice armor with the void glow
---
Oh really? Even on console?
---
Extra MM round?
---
That's definitely the easier Meta too. The more ridiculous one is Threat Levels + Surrounded or Trench Barrel, Radiance, Super fast Supers + Shotties for daaaays. Takes coordination and well timed melee to stay in range though. &lt;2 second gambit boss kills as long as the Wizards are taken out first and quickly.
---
Some heroics are not worth it though. The cryopod for example. 
---
Ikr?
---
 Optimacy set from y1 in veist poison shimmer looks fantastic, imo
---
Lucky I‚Äôm a Titan, then.
---
rampage for pve but kill clip for pvp
---
It just sucks having a full time job and only being able to play a few hours a week, crucible is so sweaty compared to D1 I'm really struggling to enjoy the PvP aspect of the game now 
---
bro i get it all classes abilities should be equal in damage output all skills should equate to the same skill as other classes in other words have the same abilities just look different if youd learn to use your classes abilities to counter that shit youd have a better experience overall 
---
Bring Cayde back as Cayde-6.9
---
Looks like bacon
---
I would be happy with that roll. Nice synergy between kill clip, feeding frenzy and reload MW. 
---
You can shoot the center glowing part of the shield at any time and they get knocked back, closing their shields and becoming totally vulnerable for a short amount of time.
---
Yup, me 2
---
Thank you for the response!
---
I will likely keep a Warlock on the side while I make the change, if I choose to at all. I'm not entirely sure how much work I want to put back into some of the quests that I'm working on. For example, I have Ace of Spades but am still only halfway to getting Breakneck. I don't know how important ranks are to me, honestly.
---
Thanks again!
---
Do you know if it's possible to complete the not forgotten part on a diffrent character ? I started the Lunas Howl on my warlock but I'd rather play on my hunter.
---
I didn‚Äôt pay for the game
---
They wanted to fight you, thats what they said right!?
---
Y
---
I guess that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called rng. What drops for me may not drop for you. Plus, who would go on the internet and tell lies? Lol jk but seriously he dropped it for me just the other day.
---
CEASE YOUR HERESY
---
r/woooosh
---
Well doesn‚Äôt effect supers, and celestial gold gun is better
---
Not worth it though. Takes too long to complete the heroic part. Baby sitting is not cool. 
---
Huckleberry is an exotic? Or no? Lol
---
Thad not at all what I said whatever be ignorant 
---
At least let us reroll stats. Literally every other game already has this. 
---
I remember commenting on this exact same thing
---
&gt;bowken
---
https://imgur.com/qoxeFC2
---
A very exotic.  Look up the cat for it too.  I got huckleberry drop from defeating a wandering powerful enemy at Dreaming City.  Best SMG and sound imho.
---
I got the new exotic vow for the 2nd time yesterday 
---
i got greedy i'm sorry
---
Skulls any auto should be fine, for damage I would recommend a closer rocket 
---
I have a Go Figure with that configuration with range as the masterwork perk. It is a beast.
---
Yes, that is what I said. Thank you!
---
Currently sitting at 74 upvotes &amp; well done snagging ikelos shotty!
---
the Cabal manning the launching of those pods has done more to hinder the guardians than anyone in them tbh
---
The entire reason i wear knucklehead radar, I love the look of the holographic eye. 
---
I saw an exotic drop yesterday and stood looking at it and I fuckin knew it was Oathkeeper not Gwisin before I picked it up. 
---
They are sone fly looking gloves tho 
---
So far, the only limited time items have been tied to holiday events such as the Dawning, and an armor set that disappeared after I think 3 seasons (you used to get it from Ikora). 
---
There is absolutely no reason to expect anything from Black Armory will become unavailable any time soon. 
---
My friend who hadn't played for 2 weeks came back to destiny, we did all the powerful rewards so he could join us in the raid. I kid you not, he got 6 exotic (from which 4 were forsaken ones so new for him) and the catalyst for huckleberry... im playing everyday and im on a 3 week non exotic spree.
---
I know its hard to believe that someone got (7) exotics in 3 hours but it really happened. I wasn't even mad just speechless..
---
Ok, if they counter so well, tell me how to counter shoulder charge with any single ability of a hunter without weapons.
---
Literally me using season 1 iron banner gear cause I've had enough of these terrible looking sets lately 
---
Needless to say.....
---
I was in the middle. I got it a few weeks back after finishing my 20th run.
---
It's RNG. I received 1KV on Last Wish run 4, and 6 out of 6 total. A guy I raid with who is in a established raiding clan, has run it 191 times according to his emblem, and didn't drop it until that last run. There absolutely needs to be some sort of RNG protection in place though. 
---
That's an awesome ship. Is there a guide somewhere detailing the triumphs needed to get it? 
---
It doesn't change my point. Most of people did pay. The point is that base game is not free, offers doesn't mater since you, today, must pay the game to access to Iron Banner mode. 
---
But congratulations, you got D2 for free. Enjoy it.
---
I prefer not to wear exotics because my escalation protocol armor looks so pretty. Same in d1 when I wore the vault of glass hunter set exclusively.
---
You would still need to kill 25 yourself tho
---
Just remember, its 500 Lunas Howl kills, so it may take a while.
---
Yeah, I kind of feel it. In crucible players are literally flying around shooting beams and "force lightning" and I have a pulse rifle.  Guess I need to do more challenges for gear.
---
Ok, so first of all I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt mean to attack you or anything. Second I see some broken logic in this post.
---
The black armory DLC is a PAID EXPANSION, similar to forsaken. if you pay for it, it‚Äôs permanent. 
---
The iron banner is a FREE EVENT, you didn‚Äôt pay for iron banner you paid for destiny 2, similar to how you didn‚Äôt pay for the dawning. Dawning and iron banner are just extra free content, and they come and go. The black armory forges are EXPANSIONS, you won‚Äôt have access if you don‚Äôt pay, therefore separating it from the base game. 
---
I think you are confusing these two, because if you really look at it you can easily see some clear differences between iron banner and the black armory and see which would be permanent and which wouldn‚Äôt.
---
And to answer your original question, yes the forges are permanent and you don‚Äôt have to worry about them leaving. 
---
You're dead when you hit low health. The AI just auto kills you.
---
Ready to bang Knuckles! Bring some lube.
---
Great roll there!! I‚Äôm definitely going to grind this out, looks way to fun!
---
But then Black Armory came...
---
Would rather have vote-kick on public matches than to suffer game after game because of bots. Would be abused on teammates that legitimately want to play though but get kicked for sucking. 
---
Should be a way that the player doing nothing yet moving would get warned that they can and will get kicked by their team if they don't start contributing damage to the opposing team. If it persists it'll give their team permission after a certain time to report then vote-kick. 
---
You can end supers with it, hunters in particular with thier little invisible phased bullshit that lasts 8 years. You shoot a pile of Telesto shots into the ground 3 usually works, Then stand and wiggle like live bait. I have a few videos of them popping super, running up to stab me and then exploding into purple mist.
---
D'oh!
---
Armor piercing, outlaw, kill clip. 
---
Masterworked it immediately
---
Alternatively, an automated kick if they contribute nothing during a round, Though at this point I'd settle for anything to combat these kinds of people.
---
Now I know what I'm making when I get my forge up and running.
---
I kinda like it. Not sure how balanced it would be in Crucible.
---
Can I get a side of Cabal too?
---
But skullfort looks fucking dumb.
---
The add clearing potential of thunderlord is insane
---
Try out Young Ahamkara‚Äôs Spine with Tripmine and Gambler‚Äôs Dodge. I like that more than Shards of Galanor. 
---
Ability damage (throwing knives) gives tripmine energy, throwing knife kills decrease knife cool down via Playing With Fire, throwing knife burn resets Gambler‚Äôs Dodge, Gambler‚Äôs Dodge resets throwing knives. 
---
Once you get the ball rolling you will become a monkey slinging poo as you throw tripmines and knives everywhere. 
---
People still play this trash? 
---
I am using the lw raid helmet/chest piece and the woven gunsmith gauntlets and enjoying it
---
Without the proper shaders it doesnt look good though
---
For now, the max power cap is 650. When the Joker's Wild dlc (2nd part of the annual pass) drops, then 700 will be the new power cap.
---
You wanna win? That's how!
---
Yea it took me a while but i found a really great clan and they are so active we did 3 raids in the first week I joined
---
I mean like compared to how far Destiny is in the future. It's in the hundreds, if not, thousands of year in the future. I'd figure that within a 200-500 years span compared to Destiny is an era.
---
Port it to PC and im down 
---
Ok guess ill have to run warlock more again
---
Why a similar ship like this drop in gofannon
---
Let get that Flawless Raider boi. 
---
You have no sense of fashion get out
---
Finding a hunter cloak that doesn't have a hood
---
All Dark Souls is Fashion Souls.
---
AN INVADER IS ON THE FIELD! Blade Barrage instantly at the point ANNNND no one got a chance at that kill.
---
Sorry about that.
---
What about when using your third eye your Shields become disabled because I was thinking the moment you shoot the silver bullet to proc the trait you'd also lose your ability to see though walls 
---
Drifter is the best character after Cayde. I really hope the next big DLC focuses on him in detail. 
---
Clan an I have made about 40ish runs. One person has 3 1k voices, someone else got one last night. So we have 4 over all! 
---
Which subclass
---
How can you not see its broken, like seriously?
---
Being able to 2 tap someone then be given instant full health an overshield plus having wallhacks on the next person to even touch you is beyond broken
---
Ophidia is a god and I‚Äôm okay with not having shards so long as I have my ophidia
---
Buy at least 2 from spider every day, dismantle gear, turn in stuff during the dawning or other events, etc.. It's honestly not difficult to get them.
---
You do realize that the damage buff is only 10% and will affect shotgun performance by &lt;.1 meters right? A full team of 4 should very easily be able to kill 1 guardian. Doesn‚Äôt matter if said guardian was a titan with OEM, warlock, or hunter. 4 people should always be able to kill 1. That 4 people could also very easily have DRB, in fact, they could have 4 DRBs. 1 titan steamrolling a good team is almost impossible. Would it happen once in a while? Yes, but is this whole situation theoretical and doesn‚Äôt happen enough to justify it being op? Also yes
---
for 7 seconds i can fucking emote for 7 seconds assess the map and make.a plan to take that fucker down if ur unwilling to do so its your fault bro stay here whining and mediocre the ability to take down shotgun rushers and shoulder charge titans will single handedly change your perception of this whole issue but again the issue lies in the fact u want it to be easy and not have to use abilities your argument is silly imho and i feel exotics should be just that exotic if it dont change the way you play its mediocre and should have been a legendary 
---
Helm of Saint-14
---
Goin for that Roman Centurion fashion build
---
Try the telesto
---
I can‚Äôt wait to pull it back out once I‚Äòm closer to max level, I feel bad wasting resources infusing over and over
---
Ya I wasnt playing with him he just did well.
---
&gt;I found it easier to kill and collect motes with Blades+Shards than it was with Chaos Reach+Geomags.
---
because chaos is more for one target then several
---
It's a mission variant strike so you should have one more person at the very least. If you're on PC/NA I can help you out. Might even have another buddy that'll join in so we can't get through it real quick.
---
i use it in crucible.. i know shame on me
---
Its not hard. You just have to play the game a lot. 
---
* Legendaries that drop can give cores. I dismantle probably 20 legendaries a day. 
---
* Scrapper Bounties award 1 each and are super easy (most of them).
---
* Finest Matterweave gives a guaranteed core and these are pretty common too when you dismantle as much gear as I do.
---
* Spider sells them. You can buy 2-3 per day depending on how many shard you have.
---
* Raiding gives TONS of legendaries so you get even more when you raid 3 times a week.
---
* The dawning - this is where I don't know how everyone doesn't have more. The dawning gave me 75 cores from 2500 dawning of essence. People could have been playing crucible non-stop the last 3 weeks and been getting cores from gifts like crazy.
---
Its not "Grinding too much", its called played a game you love a lot.
---
Exactly. Like the meme says, I'm not that good at all, just trying to get Luna's. 
---
Man you're obnoxious. 
---
I‚Äôm saying that OEM isn‚Äôt op. I gave you all these reasons why but you want to focus on me saying that you should get better than the game. And last time I checked I wasn‚Äôt the one start my statements with capital lols, if there‚Äôs anything that doesn‚Äôt add to discussions, it‚Äôs that. All I‚Äôm saying is that all these perks of the OEM isn‚Äôt over powered. It‚Äôs good. It‚Äôs very good when it falls into the right hands, but like my second point, everything is good when it falls under the right hands. It‚Äôs about finding something you can use that is also good. Are you a hunter? Warlock? Surely you have something that is also very good. That‚Äôs what my point is
---
Not on pulse rifles, just the blast furnace. My counterbalance mod works just fine on my go figure.
---
I have to disagree. I think a little tuning is in order, not a full scale nerf.
---
I feel like the tracking lasts entirely too long for something that requires 0 user input. If I shoot you one time and you happen to get behind cover, I'm then punished for getting the jump on you by not being able to freely rotate or hold the lane. Either shorter tracking window or the user needs to scope on his attacker first. I know you mention elsewhere that this doesn't seem like very long, but it's an eternity at high level play.
---
The instantaneous overshield + health seems like overkill. Other methods of earning overshields are on long cooldowns or require some level of risk. Maybe a slower generation of the overshield? IDK. This also makes it near impossible to challenge a OEM user in super.
---
The damage buff doesn't bother me at all. I think I'd care more if I played PC though. Doesn't it allow 2-taps with memento mori?
---
So, if you believe the mask is balanced, what would it take to be overpowered? Are any exotics currently overpowered?
---
Maybe a silly question. But is it better save Chaos Reach after MP the boss, or just use Chaos Reach to clean up those witches?
---
Geomag always on tho
---
It's ok, so do I ;-)
---
Look dude i'm just saying, most people don't have time for that shit, the dawning alone i had to work most of those days hence why i couldn't play for more then 2-3 hours. the buying from spider and finest, sure i do that all the time.
---
So block me then. Don‚Äôt see what help it does to tell me that....
---
I like fusions as well and LQ especially.
---
I do think it, and fusions in general, are underrated.
---
It even surpassed the 5000 PvE kills of my Ikelos SG recently.
---
It is a great ad-clear as well as an above decent dps weapon. And it is only a legendary.
---
they're so underrated i dismantled every single on i got since foresaken dropped. 
---
You do realize people create emotes from shit like this. The butt flossing dance the backpack kid made famous. The goth rave dance from that video from under the bridge. 
---
No. And you can't get the rewards, like Io's exotics.
---
Love Loaded Question. Easily one of my favorite guns. 
---
I was also skeptical at first but the ability to whip it out, wreck everything in front of you, put it back, rinse, repeat is definitely what makes it so fun. 
---
And once again you just steamroll my point with yours. The fact that you can‚Äôt even see that you aren‚Äôt discussing the topic is hilarious. You are simply stating your same comments over and over hoping people will finally just stop responding. That‚Äôs not discussion. Not one single comment you have made here shows that you are open to other suggestions and/or are even interested in others topics. I‚Äôm done responding as this is clearly just a case of you wanting to shove your opinions down others throats and don‚Äôt care what others say.
---
You can 2 tap someone with a legendary hand cannon (kindled orchid with kill clip+rampage, or any 110 with empowering rift). Instant full health is very good, I agree, but it isn‚Äôt overpowered. The overshield is regen, so if someone shoots you, u don‚Äôt get it anymore. The overshield goes away in 7 seconds, I almost never go into a gunfight with my overshield still up in competitive because you don‚Äôt get into gunfights every 7 seconds. Wall jacks is only there if the other person happens to go around a wall, and if you know you are marked by vengeance, don‚Äôt go around a wall - it won‚Äôt save u.
---
None of this would even happen if you just kill the OEM user before he kills you.
---
Personally I'd say its far from a god roll, but if it works for you then that's what is important.
---
My god roll would be:
---
Rassumen ISA
---
Steady Rounds
---
Zen Moment
---
Rampage
---
Zen moment makes this thing a damn laser on console. Once that first bullet lands there is essentially no recoil. I've been pretty lucky with most of my rolls having Zen but none with Rampage so far. Got kill clip though. It's nasty but I prefer my full auto/kill clip bygones.
---

---
The Gambit grind is never over guardian...Mote Daddy needs his motes. 
---
Saying "It's RNG" is non-informative. [RNG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation) stands for "random number generator". Obviously it's some random number generator, the question is what the probability distribution is or what it is based on. My impression is that some players are seeded with improved chances, others are not (the example you outline aligns with this idea). This could be absolutely random, or based on some obscure factor. An other hypothesis of mine is that the lower your light level is when you complete the raid, the more your chances are getting the gun. That'd explain that why so many underlevelled people carried over the raid gets the gun in the first couple of runs.
---
I believe they took the community feedback on this issue and are going to make it so that unlocking them on one unlocks them for all characters in a future patch but I could be wrong, look it up and maybe you'll find something about it
---
Most of the morons here are to incompetent to play without a shotgun and love running into things like the morons they are. The telesto is amazing if you can get it and its always funny to have a dumbass run at you and right into the telesto shots you left on the floor or around the corner. That shit never gets old.
---
Go for something with backup plan for a normal FR
---
I got a catalyst for the roaribg lion and a risk runner in the last 2-3 dayz

Patrols don‚Äôt count, you need to complete waves of escalation protocol.
---
That killed my whole team once
---
This is why I have me friends anymore. 
---
Honestly the MW would be the least of my worries I think if I was able to get that perk roll. MW is cool but it doesn't add ALL that much compared to the perk benefits.
---
I have the full game but I'm recently returned and working my characters up from 330. So I just went with it and started using the brightest, most mis-identified shaders possible. I figure if I'm gonna dress like a hobo I might as well be a colorful one.
---
So I didn't infuse anything, but I *may* have increased my rep at one of the planetary vendors. As someone told me that this uses planetary mats, it would explain a valid reason as opposed to the game arbitrarily deleting my consumables.
---
I'll pay closer attention in the next few gaming sessions, but I think I may have solved my own issue.
---
Not my contact, I can‚Äôt see without my contacts!

My Telesto is 650, melting everything. I love it
---
If u shoot the OEM, he doesn‚Äôt get his overshield. If you teamshotted him with your mate, he would be dead. If you marked for vengeance then you should always stay with your team so that he won‚Äôt be able to isolate and target you down. The hate messages suck, but honestly if they‚Äôre being hateful because of a video game then they are immature anyways and I don‚Äôt see how that changes anyways.

Completely different subject, but I think spectral blades is in a good place right now, only complaint I have is how long the duration is. At max, a roaming super should only get around 8 kills. Spectral blades is getting quite close to that limit so I think a small duration reduction could be helpful. Either way, spectral blades is easy to shutdown with a suppress grenade. Nova warp? It does way too much damage. Nova warp shouldn‚Äôt be able to 1 shot thunder crash and blade barrage. A shutdown super should always kill a roaming super. Nova warp isn‚Äôt overpowered, it‚Äôs just a little too good right now amongst the supers. A damage nerf so that it can‚Äôt 1 shot thunder crash is all I ask.

It's almost like there's a hidden exotic timer like the prime atturnement 
---
Lost your job? Damn. Best of luck finding another.
---
Woo seeing this makes me want to finish collecting all of the exotics I missed from Warmind and Forsaken. That makes all of them. 
---
You can, at least for now. I am not sure if this will change in the future. I always save a bunch of Dreaming City bounties and a few Black Armory bounties so I can complete the two weekly tasks that say "do daily bounties" for each of those right away. 
---
thanks boss
---
Yea I agree you make a great point. If you gri d yo get that close I'd call it 
---
U can‚Äôt 2 tap people with Luna with OEM damage buff btw, I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs what u mean. But Luna‚Äôs is definitely not as good as people say it is. I use it all the time in quickly play, and yes those 3 taps feel very strong, but the range on Luna‚Äôs is terrible and anything further than medium range is too far for Luna‚Äôs 
---
I fucking died at the dick and balls part. 
---
Do armor pieces from SOTP count?
---
*This is beyond science*
---
Because I am unbelievably inept at jump puzzles. So so bad. 
---
you are not alone my friend
---
You just saved me. That was it. I feel so stupid... Thanks!
---
Leave him alone D:
---

I started last night needing 477 pts  for last reset.  Got a good wining streak in quick play and then switched to Rumble to finish it.   Such a great feeling see the light at the end of the tunnel.
---
When u finally get the  weapon u want and gets nerf üòû
---
That‚Äôs the problem though they do not drop the stems. From what I have gathered they drop from doing activities on mars looting chest from lost sectors but I do not get them. 
---
No word from fenchurch today
---
Only reason I use vesper of radus
---
So you use a shotgun and slide around a lot?  Cause that is what my 25 games of rumble were against.
---
how bout we get rid of all exotics and class abilities heavy weapons and special that way its all primaries oh yea scrap random rolls too thatd balance it i think
---
Nope. Only Sunbreaker. 
---
I started this season at 1.27, the meta shifted from AR's and I fell to 1.11, Im back to 1.31 and its a freaking grind.
---
Ty for saving me the grind lol
---
"a couple times a game" mmkay. I bet you benefit MORE from your Exotic than any other class right now. And the difference between supers being "shitty" and being "overpowered" is typically 4-8 kills a game, and titans have a few strong Supers of their own, Warlocks have 1, Hunters have 2, Titans have arguably several that are capable of multi-kills and team wipes.
---
Thank mans, predicate it :)
---
You know after farming for 3 days like crazy 
---
It still didn't drop for me
---
Exactly what I‚Äôd like to ask.. Where‚Äôs all your Exotics and Armor sets?! 
---
just tried out riskrunner in gambit abd it clears ads like a dream, team just has to pick up motes and bank. and most importantly it clears blockers reaally fast. plus works wonders on right primeval
---
No. 
---
&gt;what's not to love?
---
It's not whisper. 
---
the truth is no, u cant get them back through dismantling, and if u contact their support they might solve the problem for u. 
---
Honestly I know what you mean the lunas howls quest put my KD even lower because I am lower than average and it suck when you go into comp and you get stomped 
---
Thanks man and I wish you the same :)
---
run out of ammo 
---
My brother said that Thanos from the movie (not comic Thanos) is a purple rip off of Ghaul, and keep in mind my brother isn't a Destiny fan. What does anyone else think?
---
That makes sense and I don‚Äôt have a problem with it, I want it to be hard because if it‚Äôs easy then there‚Äôs no real accomplishment 
---
So I'm this guy that likes to invade a lot with a Crooked Fang and snipe some enemies off. I'm almost always getting 2/3/4 kills when the pull the PE first. Fuck Chaos Reach and the meta. 
---
When you invade at the right time and drive the enemy mental there is always a way to win Gambit!
---
PS. I'm a warlock running Chaos Reach, desperately searching for Geomags
---
Thanks man but I still have a lot to learn 
---
Thank you
---
11/10 a vanguard shader that everyone use as free shard
---
It stops the wipe mechanic. I think you can only stop it 2 times though.
