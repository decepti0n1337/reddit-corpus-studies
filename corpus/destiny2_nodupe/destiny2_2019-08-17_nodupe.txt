It behaves exactly the same on PC. 
---

---
However, on PC for handcannons, you have options in 140/150 as well and on console they are harder. I joke that with Thorn on console, you have to ‚Äútrust‚Äù your shots. 
---
But on console, 110 and 180 are king without a ton of options.
---
---
---
Hah yeah true, that will be a nice change, so people can make their own effective loadouts that fit their play styles, and yeah most raids are just a well warlock and celestial hunter or something similar to that, it‚Äôll be nice to use something else, like I would really love to use nova warp or chaos reach in a raid, those are two really fun supers
---
I just got salty today I wasn‚Äôt expecting that
---
Yeah and some more weapon variety too hopefully. D1 raids there were so many options but the past 3 months all I‚Äôve used is mountaintop recluse and swarm.
---
 Boosting people up gives players who quit because of the grind a chance to go back and play what they missed without waiting ages to reach that point just so the mode would be abandoned. If there were no boost it give player further incentive not to play since the gap would be bigger effectively killing any returning player traffic. For example people who didnt like black armory were left with an empty mode when gambit prime dropped and if it werent for the 650 bounties they would have had a tough time levelling up. Its also for the best as it puts more players into lfg and matchmaking pools.
---
Aim for the head.
---
Age of triumph is kinda like that.

I HEREBY DUB THEE, VEX TRASH-CANS

If you have the ornament it gets more range and it‚Äôs a beast

All i need is curtain call which i really want and home run which if i dont get i wont be mad but for real though this is ridiculous.

Kinderguardian
---
What is that exotic weapon second from the left in that picture of what I assume to be a vault?
---
Isnt that bad. ‚ÄúRelaxxxxxx guardian‚Äù
---
Strictly a PvP weapon, but it is a beast if you're good with slug shotguns. Just don't try to jump and shoot. Lol.
---
i want my red death back damnit
---
Damn now I feel doubly attacked
---
Zhalo, oh how I miss you.
---
Having too many buffs limit build diversity (forces players to play a specific build to get the buff,) increases power creep (makes it difficult to balance around,) and can cause most PvE content to be trivialized in seconds.         
---
I understand why they are doing it, and I'm all for it. It makes sense.
---
It's just a meme about how I was so close to reviewing it. But was just 2 points away
---
Who's MC?
---
main characters/npcs sorry xD
---
Fuck it I still use it looks and sounds cool
---
You want high impact fusions (for pvp at least) dunno how this will fair in pve, but I can tell you you wouldn't hang well with this archetype in pvp
---
Too busy being dad. Lol
---
He's selling stronghold? WHAAAAT?
---
Who the hell downvoted this? Must‚Äôve been a warlock... with your radiant ass wells and your rifts. Suck my weapons of light bitches.
---
Have you seen the other classes Melee ability in D2?
---
GIVE ME MY EXOTIC EMBLEM BUNGO
---
Probably will just making sure it's worth thx for the suggestion üòäüëç
---
I know what I'm calling them from now on
---
Oh ok thank you for the info
---
Amazing hair buddies üòÑ
---
Make sure you do collector stuff before getting a synth from another activity.  Try to bank 15 motes and earn half banked medals which is 50 motes banked.  You only get 1 synth during game for first medal that awards synths.  If you have not got a collector medal yet stay away from killing high value targets and killing blockers.  
---
The synth you get at the end game is random so technically you have 25% chance for that.
---
Those Sumbreakers though. They look sweet!
---
When I see the OEMs scared of the non-OEM, I think that's legit fear because they don't know how else to do well in Crucible üòÇ
---
I sometimes go and watch old destiny 1 videos to listen to his voice :,) I miss him a bit but Nolan has done a good job filling in.
---
I loved Dinklebot. And I'll trash Nolan north all day I hate his version of our ghost
---
That sparrow has given us more content then dark below and curse of Osiris
---
i then proceed to nova bomb and blow his ass up like in the show (also spoiler alert)
---
Its a metaphor, in destiny we are all just rats chasing that cheese~
---
Lmao ah, Dinklebot..
---
Not the right forge mate
---
You have till October I believe
---
Find out next week on DESTINY 2 Z
---
Yeah I reloaded the Drang and it didn‚Äôt affect it giving Sturm overcharges.
---
HOLY SHIT THIS IS AMAZING NEWS
---
People are only going to mention the watermark, so...
---
#made with memeatic
---
He's in the Whisper, just not as fun
---
No sike. It was in part three of the director's cut put out earlier.
---
Man I remember my brother showing me the loot cave. He probably messed with it the entire time it was available and I got to for like a day lol. It was hilarious seeing 10+ guardians camping it out. Or the old Russia zone when you could have an easy chest rotation
---
All the maps for countdown sucked. It all relied on who got the first snipe and which team knew what guarding an orb was
---
An incredible mission that is only playable once per character. Dam this should be a freaking strike!
---
Mida and Nameless Midnight I reckon
---
Read the title.. I have already unlocked Bergusia and am just doing my weekly.
---
Search and destroy was fun wdym
---
It's probably more of leftover memes from a time when hating on D2 was popular and some people don't realize the meme died
---
Man, I had this much Baryon at one point.
---
as Title says, I have already cleared Bergusia, this was me doing my weekly. Bergusia should be able to do all frames.
---
Dude I‚Äôm lovin‚Äô it
---
Sick
---
Worked second time, Guess it was because I didn't hit the tank. I was off side killing fallen for another bounty and by the time I cleared that the other two had melted the tank. The other bounties that require a cleared forge run didnt also tick off so not landing a hit on the final boss must not count it as complete.
---
My friend did it in 2 days. Get a group off the D2 app and go get it my guy.
---
Amazon Alexa
---
‚ÄúAlexa order vex milk‚Äù
---
Technically lighthouses or spires but vex trash cans are better
---
Implying they weren‚Äôt already mandatory for having Sunbreaker super and auto-reload class ability.
---
Whenever Hunters matter we‚Äôll be happy
---
And stop bringing it into the new game jesus
---
We gotta make sure to weed out the weak from the strong before proceeding. Sword Logic is imperative to the success of raids. 
---
Also I just like seeing everyone struggle against the Colossus.
---
I have a opening shot, rampage, full choke, and acc rounds with range masterwork
---
Or a hunter with shatter strike in certain encounters.
---
Bethesda??? You on the right subreddit???
---
Aren‚Äôt they always.
---
Moon's haunted
---
This is definitely a boomer moment
---
I used to as well but now all I see is people hating anything Destiny 2 does that isnt exactly how Destiny 1 was
---
aye. i do miss casting arc soul and watching my dudes lay waste
---
10 years on console
---
Idk lets ask Cayde!
---
Luke Smith stated that it's on an *indefinite* hiatus. Pretty sure he also states that they are NOT working on any form of trials at the moment lol.
---
I'm downloading Destiny 2 again after a 4 month haitus, could someone tell me how is the bubble better now please?
---
Is this a joke?
---
We have SSDs, they let you load the game faster than you can have a sip of tea and on any pc you can just open your inventory instantly. We can all swap weapons between deaths in crucible, or in any activity, really. You should try it dude
---
It's really strange playing both spectral blades and fist of havoc now. When I Bottom tree striker, I feel like I can abuse the lunge over and over, lagging the hit detection and not use any energy. I try and use a light melee in spectral to skate a little closer to someone and it feels like my super meter is have gone. I really feel like the two aren't meant for the same game.
---
Ugh. I fixed it. See how scrambled I am rn.
---
If you think about it like this, Forsaken is Y2 destiny with 3 DLCs for ¬£40, where as Shadowkeep is Y3 Destiny with more content coming over the next couple of months( every 3 assuming) so with the DDE you'll be buying a full years worth of content separately. With only Base D2 and CoO and Warmind free (although confusingly they allow you to play on the locations people bought with forsaken? Like why bungo)
---
Theoretically the game files should all be there you might have to find the right place to copy/paste them.
---
Same hairstyle slightly bigger beard. Datto thinks he‚Äôs fooling us with that disguise
---
Manage your consumables inventory better.
---
It's no one's fault but your own, hate to tell ya.
---
You can put the code in the wish wall to go to riven. You will have to do riven and the heart again but that takes like 10 minutes. And btw that your own fault you could have just used the destiny 2 companion app and got it from your post master from there and you could have saved time
---
Well will still be the choice for endgame even after the nerf.
---
They may reduce the empowering effect to 30% but the healing effect is insane. You also have healing nades when your health is low, benevolent dawn procs on healing allies, reviving allies and allies standing in rift.
---
Needless to say, you have an empowering melee for your team mates which increases damage  when not in the well. It's still the strongest pve class, and it's not even close.
---
Assumingly you would be allowed to search through your folders and find the game... although you might have to update the game on battle.net to the New light version(as mentioned above) for this to work.
---
Not sure where the toxicity of playing the game the way I like is buddy, telling me not to play if I'm not as good as you on the other hand? Yeah that'll do it.
---
What‚Äôs that map I‚Äôve been never seen it?
---
Im a fan of IHE and I kinda agreed with every point he made
---
It doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt like this game and haven‚Äôt poured hundreds of dollars and hours into it
---
There was a lot of hype put into Destiny being the successor of Halo, which we all know didn‚Äôt really get to that expectation 
---
Lets all hope Shadowkeep blows us away
---
Breakthrough you trash can.
---
I think in one of the ViDocs is shows more than Eververse armours, some sort of special event armour. Personally I hope Iron banner armour and other special event armours get added to this system and not just Eververse stuff.
---
I used to say the same thing at first, until I got my first army of one, it's a hell of a adrenaline rush.
---
Hmm thanks for the extensive reply, but yea I‚Äôll have to think about it because school‚Äôs coming up. The one time I did Menagerie was really fun though
---
Alright thanks.
---
Last to last week was godly with the OEM and Stompee5 tho
---
New light will be the new base version of the game for everyone, buying the DLCs will give you access to the Previous Base game and the DLC you paid for. So yes, you can try out New light on your Xbox and then buy Shadowkeep after.
---
Alright thanks
---
You could fucking not. It ruins the olaylist
---
Bungie has already strayed away from previous D1 business model buy offering content during the "Dry season" of content, this Shadowkeep and feature additions to Season buying seems to indicate that we get D2 for at least another year before D3 becomes announced....I'm curious to know if Bungie are still going with their 10 year plan or not.
---
He did say the best state it's ever been, as in up to this point, not the best state it will ever be.
---
That reference. Man i love that movie so fucking much
---
I just finished mine yesterday, and was starting my warlock but as soon as I went into the eaz I just went nope, exited to orbit and trashed the whole set.
---
Fair... I‚Äôm just kinda bias because he keeps selling exotics I already have /:
---
I‚Äôll never tell, if you intend to poison Crucible with your scummy win lobbies. It‚Äôs sickening
---
It's got void smears on the sides but it has a solar drive which is kinda lame
---
His forsaken video is so stupid imo. The biggest leap forward destiny has had and he's hating on it
---
You could buy Forsaken and the AP rn and get it for free on Steam (to my understanding) your characters will all be light level 750 and after a few hours doing Forsaken Story I would count that as all caught up.
---
I fuckin' hate warlocks
---
Still haven‚Äôt done the leviathan raid once im on Xbox and don‚Äôt have enough friends to do it ;(
---
Best feeling in the world
---
Very few games even get close to that concurrently
---
Ha, same
---
I mean, we'll probably become perma bubbles now. But at least we get to shoot.
---
Wow, that is one ugly laugh
---
D1 had so many choices no wonder it took minutes to find a lobby
---
Haha my comment is literally one or two down from this, saw it yesterday on a Geoff keighley tweet about gamescom and destiny announcements
---
Holy fuck, 101 motes?!
---
Meh tired of all the negativity around Titans in PVE.  This shit just swirls and swirls takes on its own form. Titans are fine, we getting WOL. Thats great. But the rest is nonsense.
---
Wait how many people do you think play it
---
Take away celestial and you still have a golden gun with infinite ammo as long as you kill things.
---
Lunafaction boots are a Y1 exotic. Just like Celestial. I want them both to continue existing.
---
I know how you feel dude, all im missing is the braytech osprey, ikelos sniper and the dreaming city hand cannon and sniper, I mainly play solo as well but when I was doing strange terrain with friends, one of my friends got the osprey first try, it was his first ever nightfall as well.
---
Yeah, my friend is insane. He was just going for triumphs to start with but it resulted in an absurd amount of banking notes for him.
---
Yeah, so it's only good for trash mobs. Also lasts a really short time
---
guided games? that hunk of junk? bruh just head to r/DestinySherpa if you want to sherpa newbies, guidef games is the most useless piece of shit ever
---
The shooting is consistent and reliable. The different subtypes of guns feel different as well. Bungie did a really good job with them
---
Lol none of them are bad that's just *YOUR* opinion. Dont you think they are saying the exact same thing about D2? All those games are multimillion dollar investments and none of them are inherently *bad* their just not your cup of tea vs Destiny.
---
Dead guardian there is*
---
And if you‚Äôre on Xbox I‚Äôll do the same. Maybe I‚Äôll use the one where the guardian pops two flairs and goes to his knees.
---
The green smoke emote from The Rock... Great movie! ü§òüèª
---
Destiny's community is one of the kindest and best communitys that I could've ever joined. I love this community as much as the game.
---
Same goes to Warframe and Halo.
---
Sorry completely wrong wording on my part, I ment those games are just super predatory and PTW (mainly 2k) and I've don't my research on those games and know that as a fact while they just jump on the bandwagon of destiny hate and also games can be objectively bad, cod and fortnite aren't bad but 2k is literally the SAME EXACT THING every fucking year and there is no denying that
---
I know stomp exists for a reason but I just think it's excess in the form it is now because for one it almost one hits you in most cases if not out right kills you and the velocity and distance it sends you flying is ridiculous like if you're anywhere near a wall if you didn't die from the stomp you'll die from the impact of hitting a wall though. And snipers I'm just complaining cause I enjoy using snipers but they kinda just ain't viable damage wise.(non exotic special ammo snipers.
---
With empowering rift and inertia it does
---
I use a machine gun, Hammerhead with masterwork range precisely ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
That's one of the reasons they condensed it down.
---
It's okay it might just be 6 Thundercrash Titans. Who am I kidding, it's never Thundercrash
---
Or just use a Banner Shield for teammates to get close
---
Thx
---
üôèüòäVery helpful
---
Pvp means direct fighting between 2 players, not 2 teams competing for points.
---
I just wish I could get my Purpose back. It's literally my only trials gun that osnt on my collections
---
It's almost like that's the writers job
---
Na. They fallen. They can die
---
What sparrow is that?
---
You heard what I said
---
otherside, season 3 from zavala
---
Welcome!
---
I can mean both. Car games also have pvp you need to beat the other time, how about that?
---
How much is it to buy it?
---
Is that the 150 rpm scout?
---
7500 glimmer and 5 shard, dismantles into 500 glimmer and 5 shards
---
If it's so easy why don't I get put into the premade group and win every round huh? Good thing I already got the 10 matches I needed for the armor it better be good fucking armor
---
Actually I was more referring to the fact that the Scorn had an anti-light round loaded into the crossbow, similar to that of Thorn in its original lore which was able to kill guardian‚Äôs by inflicting lethal damage with the rounds from it. That‚Äôs why our Ghost technically can‚Äôt take damage, it‚Äôs because the Light is protecting him constantly. It‚Äôs why Cayde‚Äôs ghost died though, since the Anti-Light allowed the round to actually impact and break the ghost. So technically if Cayde himself had been shot with that round, he would have passed away unable to be healed by his ghost.
---
Wait did I miss something? I keep seeing references to Crota.
---
Lmao, I was like ‚Äúwho tf screenshotted my vault‚Äù
---
Same feeling. I love invading even if I'm just using  my bs machine gun.
---
That sux guardian, look at it like this tho, come reset ur in there!!!!!
---
That is not good at all because that means 2.5k costs 5shards its even better to trade with spider for that matter or just buy planetary items for 1shard they vuy packages and dismantle it
---
Thanks man it sucks we couldn‚Äôt get those extra 4 points to make it a win but hey one less part of the solstice armor I gotta do so I ain‚Äôt mad about it
---
https://youtu.be/bJhMG9gzPSc - this bad boy!
---
You get shards back on dismantle as well
---
r/technicallythetruth
---
Oh yh in that case its better, you need 100weapons forged for it, I am too lazy for that.
---
Suppressor is ONLY on void dumby, cant be a OEM Striker and have suppressors or shoulder charge because that's only on top tree not bottom
---
I'm in lol. dance party. I still vengefully whack those fuckers every time I passed by for my blueberry days. I started the red war shortly after black armory dropped.
---
Yup, I didn't really find any useful advice when I googled it. The only thing I know I did, was improve the cooling around my computer (it was a period of really hot summer weather). But, I don't really think that was it (had no issues in other games).
---
Eliksni is the actual species that fallen are. They're called fallen because when the traveler left them they fell into some sort of a dark age for them, and somehow they aquired the fallen as a name. There is a byf vid somewhere with this info.
---
It‚Äôs not going away it‚Äôs just only gonna be 3v3 survival instead of 4v4 with a chance of being countdown, survival, clash, or control
---
The Fallen are called 'Eliksni'.
---
They are now called Fallen because they haven fallen from grace, so to speak.
---
For sure!
---
LOL You're actually calling me salty after the way you comment and reply? Dude...... really? Self-awareness is a thing, not sure if you've heard of it XD
---
Patrick K. a bitch
---
Lol it's easy use the pulse rifle frame, equip bad juju and do the lost sector in the dreaming City right behind where you spawn. All the steps can be done in 2 runs
---
I like it.
---
When you get decent on landing your headshots learn to crouch and use spectral blades. Easiest done with a sniper but every crouched headshot kill gives you 12 seconds of the best wall hacks xur can't even sell. Like OEM Striker, it's truly the only good competitive option for hunter but instead people are here complaining about other subclasses when we all have the same access to OP fun
---
I usually do machine gun frame and just start leviathan up kill the NPCs, I mean this one will get done eventually I am on 48frames rn.
---
Clash is butts I prefer obj pvp and clash always takes longer because there‚Äôs no drive to gather at a certain objective and faceoff it‚Äôs a lot more passive
---
Nice congrats and enjoy
---
Ans Survival! And Clash! /s
---
You will never reach fabled

My husband bought them for me years ago from the Bungie Store. I don't think they're still available :| they were apparently quite the hot commodity  [https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/3qf81s/stress\_engrams\_pulled\_out\_from\_bungie\_store/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/3qf81s/stress_engrams_pulled_out_from_bungie_store/)

For reference, the top game on steam as of right now is dota 2 with about 630k, with CSGO following close behind.
---
Im stocking up on as much l can

Yeah, as Titans we‚Äôre all guilty of still doing this.
---
It's funny how the only replies I get on reddit are from triggered Destiny players when I make comments like this.
---
Wow

‚ÄúI recommend you go to Xur on Titan...‚Äù

How about we just make it a ‚Äúhold y for another game‚Äù button.

I think its more they WISH Overwatch was dead. I had my Overwatch gripes but they came from killing Battleborn. But Overwatch is still pretty popular.
---
Nah, players actually do what they're supposed to in those modes. SoloQ Control is just a fiesta.
---
Or it makes you requeue if you didn't get any stats. It could be all nice and just say it wants you to find a different match, or it could bash you for being afk. Either way stats usually indicate that a player is afk,so they can be used against the afk player.
---
I'm excited to see how less punishing the Comp system will be since they're basing it on skill...tired of topping the leaderboard with a positive k/d on a losing side because my teammates are potatoes, and I get punished for it by losing Glory.

My gambit crew have been using bubbles on occasion. a couple nights ago we dropped one and just all waited in it. the invader came, fired up hammer of sol, charged into the saint-14 enhanced bubble, and we all just melee'd him to death, follow by a lot of laughing.
---
And i  true gamer spirit he met him in an arthur shirt what a legend
---
Am I going crazy or does that look more like the fanatic of Crota from court of oryx
---
Take an upvote.
---
I hear yea.  I‚Äôm not ripping on Warframe or anything as I‚Äôve heard great things about the game.  
---
Destiny‚Äôs fan base has its fair share of headache inducing players as well.  Before I joined a decent sized clan I used to LFG everything, and although I did meet a few cool players, the majority of the people I‚Äôd link up with were super toxic.
---
I don‚Äôt use OEM and I rarely play Striker. Loved Sentinel Shield, looking forward to it being viable again. Can‚Äôt stand the aesthetics of OEM.
---
That often happens if your lower power than your possible max. I respect the grind though
---
Lol... that‚Äôs a good one. I don‚Äôt have a single ounce of wit to think of something like that
---
Can‚Äôt wait
---
Its 8 seconds, It seems that you dont really know anything about other classes but you just like to hide your insecurity (OEM)  when people calls you out.
---
You spam and abuse oem and bottom tree striker, wich is the strongest combo the game series has ever seen, but you cant contain yourself to blame any other classes skills so people wont call OEM overpowered anymore.
---
Youre a self entittle titan and also youre sad af.
---
Go to your inventory you have boxes/chests that you get you use 15 keys each chest you open

Year 3 raid armor ornaments... oh how I miss you
---
New player here, so I was playing out the campaign, and I definitely enjoyed it D2. I'm on the fence as i'm confused on the Forsaken dlc. If i buy it know, what exactly will I get? Also just curious now, can most content be played with randos as it might be a bit hard for me to play premades.
---
$11
---
General Reposti, you are a bold one.
---
Yeah, dont take the comment to seriously..
---
Yes. Thanks for understanding what I was getting at.
---
I don‚Äôt disagree but for some reason I feel the drive to hoard everything I can in this game.
---
Wrong sub man. 
---
This gonna get deleted
---
If you wanna get a good taste of endgame content and Exotics before it launches, you should definitely get it whenever you can.
---
*Flashbacks to doing the 390 Crota raid with me and the bois and getting word of Crota and hunger of Crota*
---
I wish I still had time to play Destiny. D1 was amazing. Loved soloing Crota‚Äôs End
---
Still better than bosses that go immune every 30 seconds
---
true. i think the regular crucible loot pool needs more love. theyre already going to increase drop chances for actual SotD stuff. So they say lol
---
Mate, I don't know what your on but I don't know you.. I can take you to Zavala if you want
---
This used to happen to me from time to time before. After trying everything with different drivers, scan and repair all the time etc, I finally did a memtest on my ram and found it had sadly gotten a couple of bad sectors. My intuition was that whenever game content was read from these sectors the game would crashe and corrupt some cache or other game files. I swapped the faulty memory stick to a spare one I had and have never had the issue again.
---
This actually made me laugh pretty hard. Good job.
---
I‚Äôm fine with that, it‚Äôs such a fun super
---
shieeeet
---
In the meantime, if you want I can go have some "words" with that asshole on your behalf.
---
At that point you pretty much have two options, one is to look around as fast as possible to hope you can see him or two to just accept your fate and emote until you die
---
I got back into destiny because of forsaken, but let‚Äôs not forget that most of the reason forsaken was so successful was because it brought the game back to being more like destiny 1, and that isn‚Äôt much of an accomplishment. 
---
The in game story was cliche, there was only a couple weapon perks you were really chasing, the good new exotics were in a massive drought, and returning players had to use ridiculous farms just to get old exotics in a reasonable time frame.
---
It‚Äôs easy to look back with rose-tinted glasses, but forsaken was a foundation, not a leap forward. Hopefully shadowkeep will be that leap, as it sits in a much better position to move the franchise past what‚Äôs already been done
---
Like I have stuff to do I can‚Äôt sit in my basement chugging 5 hour energy to stay awake while I grind out a single piece of armor
---
Nice
---
Yeah, on 360, you can have content with the 1st 2 raids. Vault of Glass and Crota
---
Got more than a month so you can pace yourself so you dont lose your mind lol
---
yeah well have i sayed anything agains this? i thing not. my comment is more an advise for the future. yeah its a common tactic and its all nice. but i woulnd recommend doing it to store glimmer u dont need. if u play a lot you dont need this tactics. because uearn much
---
New jez video?
---
Very true
---
It should count, yes
---
Do I specifically need to be alive at the end of that section or will I have a chance at it as long as the chest gets opened?
---
That right there is enough supers to have it active an entire match length
---
Grew dummy thicc from stronk

Haha nope :)

I hear the most complaint from the ‚Äúonly pvp‚Äù playerbase about their supers and about how them can‚Äôt just play pvp to get max everything. They can go fuck themselves. Pvp was never meant to be bigger than pve in Destiny and if they suck so bad they can‚Äôt get kills with only 1 super per game maybe they should get better. The fucking grind for Recluse was just stupid as I was soloing and it was just constant supers. Took me a day of straight grinding so wasn‚Äôt too bad just I saw more supers than I should have. Only thing that looks confusing to me are the mods but I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôll be explained more when it comes out and it won‚Äôt be that confusing
---
Any loot game with trading ends up regretting it and getting rid of it. 
---
The loot chase is the bane. Take that away or make it too easy and there‚Äôs no reason to play
---
This is destiny points are assigned randomly
---
Xur or year 1 raids.
---
Yes that's true too
---
Still no luck man can't get celestial..
---
*laughs in never done a single raid*
---
You get a nighthawk in the story
---
So what was their endgame I wonder? Why jump in the Gambit if you are just going to sit and do nothing?
---
Pay him for it.
---
While I don't disagree with your sentiment, I've never seen Bungie say anything remotely close to not making a game for casuals. If anything they have been going to great lengths to make it accessible and approachable to everyone at any level
---
I didn't get the drop..
---
Seriously, if you aren't going to play then backout of the game.
---
Yep.
---
Do you understand how Xur works? His engram gives you an item you don't have yet. It won't give duplicates until you've gotten every item Xur is capable of giving you. 
---
Note that Xur's engram can't give exotics added after Forsaken (the annual pass exotics), armor for a class you don't buy it with, or guns that come from quests.
---
Collection purposes tho
---
Anyone who downvoted this comment is a causal and is upset that they can't special and super spam their way to an easy max level.
---
He paid for it so yeah he should get it even if you did most of the work.
---
SAME!
---
Give it to him and start fresh. You know what you‚Äôre doing. Lfg is live 24/7. So fireteams are good to go 24/7 if you need them.
---
Do I pay in skooma or shards or coins?
---
Because the cap is increasing to 250k with New Light.
---
Well the last line makes me think its someone who made this to take the piss out of bungie.
---
I think the game should be accessible to Casals, you just shouldn‚Äôt only be able to play PVP and be able to get Max Light, and you also shouldn‚Äôt be able to Spam 4 Supers in one Quickplay game in PVP in my Opinion. It looks like Shadowkeep is doing all of that plus some from my point of view
---
I would delete everything before you give it to him, sounds scummy of him to just take it like that
---
As frank as possible, you haven't been listening to everything that they said since they started teasing shadowkeep. Since the beginnings of Shadow keep teases alone, bungie to include Luke Smith and Mark Noseworthy, essentially the bosses have said that if you are a player that logs in for an hour or two a week, you're going to end up quitting the game, they also said the type of player that only wants to do a little here and there is not THE MARRIAGE they want between players and their game.
---
Just throw a grenade at the ground and start the party yourself. Way more fun
---
Bruh that's whack
---
I don't think so because it was my buddy and he doesn't have shadowplay
---
Thank you
---
I guess I'm meaning in terms of actual effect in game, they are not that similar. Agree to disagree.
---
I literally have the exact same role smh
---
Honestly didn't notice your username and what your agenda here actually is, now the context has been explained I understand! Sorry for confusion
---
I ran Shattered Throne for the first time last weekend and the ship dropped. My clan mates laughed because a few of them still don‚Äôt have it.
---
It's got dragonfly, so let's hope they can land the headshots.
---
She says a squad of 9, so that's three fireteams of 3.
---
You will charged back tax with compound interest per minute played
---
I mean it was a raid for a solid 24 hours, and then everything changed when the modem unplug attacked.
---
[removed]
---
Lol, that seems to be a common occurrence. My wife and I both got the ship on our first completion.
---
i'm still confused as to what i will have to rebuy. I am using my PS4 as my main account, which has all DLCs and Shadowkeep digital deluxe pre-ordered. I have Forsaken on PC. I am not going to but Shadowkeep a second time on PC because PS4 will remain my primary platform so I am not concerned with that. However, will I have to rebuy Forsaken AGAIN on PC if I already have the entitlements to it on Bnet and soon Steam?
---
Bye
---
i play on pc at 144 hz all the time and i can play on xbox just fine. although when i play it on my tv it looks like shit. my monitor looks fine though.
---
Oh, no doubt. I'm just speaking about easy to access. I've not met anyone, no clan, and I'm not seeing any matchmaking for anything beyond strikes. I don't raid like I used to, but seems most of the content requires putting together your own groups with people you know there unless I've missed something.
---
Disrespecting people is what's spineless my man
---
Y‚Äôall heard the noise when you reverse with the SP Junior?
---
Updoot incoming!!!
---
You have to unlock each of the forges in order. Sorry to bring bad news :/
---
Vex encryption? Unbreakable... so they say.
---
You can have people leave at any point, it only fails if someone dies
---
Not really cuz if ur overshield breaks just step back in the bubble
---
r/wooooshwith4os
---
Even Fenchurch doesn't know her name.
---
Oh man üò¢ does it take long to unlock them by any chance? How do you unlock the second one too? I just unlocked the first one just now. Thanks!
---
If you combine all 50 of this week‚Äôs edge transit drops, you get the new exotic: Edge Transita
---
r/whooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSSSHHHHHH69HHHHHHHHH
---
Sent you a message with an 8K version, go nuts :)
---
W- why do you dare raise him a titan...
---
r/twentycharacterlimit
---
I have too much glimmer all the time what do you need it for? Upgrading and infusing weapons right
---
Menagerie and Reckoning, and Black Armory Forges are matchmade, and if you do the invitation to the menagerie questline you‚Äôll get a set of 690 gear to immediately jump into full endgame content. Also what platform are you on?
---
Also think that a hunter should be able to outrun a Titan in super Saiyan (Fist of havoc)
---
Because through and through he‚Äôs a titan. He plays all 3. But that boy can walk out o any gun fight unscathed and it will always baffle me
---
You gotta submit the code
---
Don‚Äôt listen to that. You don‚Äôt need a range masterwork on snipers (especially PvP) because much much more than enough.  
---
The roll you have has two of the 4 best perks available, no distractions is good if you can watch a corner for a few seconds. Pretty good!
---
How are stompees a problem?
---
You can't reset glory.
---
And buying bounties, things from Spider, stuff from collections if you need a weapon to finish a quest, etc.
---
[Me too.](https://i.imgur.com/7AKefYR.png) Hoping they don't change the amount before I end up needing to dismantle these.
---
Pretty much how I'm gonna feel after I'm done with destiny campaigns XD
---
Have you ever gone up against a semi-decent stompees hunter? Ever?
