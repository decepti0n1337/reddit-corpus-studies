Titans are basically just a crutch in pvp. They get a one hit melee, supers that either have such a big blast radius that there is no way you can miss a kill, or they make you so tanky you are guaranteed at least one kill, they have arguably some of the best pvp exotics in the game (OEM), and are able to place down barricades to protect themselves and teammates when capturing objectives. 
---

---
The only downside to titans is they have low mobility and SUCK in pve for most situations. 
---
Take a hunter for an example, almost all of their abilities require skill to use. Knifes? Skill (and even then they deal little to no damage) Dodging? Skill. Golden gun? At least you actually have to aim with it. Blade barrage? Not a good example. Truesight? Requires precision. 
---
Am I saying if you use a titan you must be unskilled and in need of a crutch? No. Just pointing out that their loadout appeals to more easy to use than other classes which makes them very annoying to deal with (especially new guardians. Its like the only ability they know how to use is shoulder charge)
---
I’m max light already. I just need something to do for the 2 months between now and Shadowkeep
---
I'm a solo player since D1. After thousands of hours played I've done everything and anything in both D1 and 2. I've never understood people that say they can't do something because you need a group. It's so easy to find good players to do things.  From flawless in trials to flawless raids. This community is amazing and the bungie companion app + the console lfg makes it simple
---
eeeellllLLLLIKE A GLOVE
---
But then everyone hates you because you interrupted their farming, just leave if you don’t want to farm.
---
Anyone else hard? No? Ok just me
---
Played it on PC today, it's going to be great.
---
Wait is it out already
---
I have forsaken and am at 750 light. I just want something to do from now to September when Shadowkeep releases; does the annual pass cover that much with engaging content?
---
They better bring a guardian
---
Oh your 750 already my bad, I still think it's worth it especially for the new raids and menagerie
---
You're probbaly going to be overwhelmed either way, why not play
---
Yeah this season especially made it compelling for me. Thanks for the reply!
---
You Nailed it

Good point haha

Neither of us were running quality gear. It was for a good part of it me going solo. But once I got a teammate, things went better.
---
For PvE probably Field Prep and Fourth Time’s a Charm. For PvP, Snapshot and Quickdraw with max range.
---
They even added a little Devrim
---
Yes it's worth it.  Very worth it. 2 raids and a ton of other content.
---
Yep! If you stick around and listen to his lines, he mentions how he misses his partner, Mark.
---
Then someone else joins.  Stop caring about other people.
---
Damn! I just wonder how many times did it take.
---
Outstanding move.
---
No I went to the Outpost discovery event in Orlando.
---
Back in d1 they sorry missions and strikes you could do solo. Not sure why they got rid of it for d2
---
Oh was halo reach there to play or was it just normal halo on pc
---
On a similar note my wife and I like taking our time, solo-ers in matchmaking are all a bunch of leeroys
---
RIP my argument.

Not sure how I completely forgot about that bit.

The steam version coming in September is the  new light edition
---
You have problems
---
their self-commentated crucible videos got me from garbage tier to mediocre.
---
The only reason I said 0 deaths is because I invaded 4 times and wiped them 3 times, and then continued to stay alive and kill them when they invaded
---
Staying alive is still kinda... Hard against ads depending on the enemys
---
One after another
---
Hold shit
---
WE’RE NOT AIMING FOR THE WALL
---
Its the ship you go to as part of the menagerie quest
---
Staying alive is easy if your getting 90 or less kills. anything more you have to be hyper aggressive getting up in the adds faces. if you don’t your teammates get the kills. 17 guardian kills (i think) is impressive as hell, more than slaying out on adds, but that was my best game from someone who doesn’t play much gambit outside of powerful drops for leveling
---
I’m competitive in everything I do though. Being the best or winning is fun for me
---
I would absolutely say by forsaken usually, but it’ll be free in two months or so when Shadowkeep releases. You could probably pick it up fairly cheaply though. 
---
You can boost it but I think you need forsaken to do it(could be wrong)
---
OOOO THERE ARE DREGS
---
Thank gosh that I have friends to help me out w thing that require a group. But yea, there are really obnoxious people in lfgs that think they’re the best at the game

 Crown Matador is recruiting. We are a new clan dedicated to pvp, looking for top notch pvp players. A combat trial (a couple games of comp) will be required. For more info message Nsane#5651 on discord or Nsane#11521 on battle net.
---
Look dude that's not helpful. I want to know how to use the noble rounds? Do I have to hip fire a teammate like someone else said? Does it give a rampage like buff?
---
How do you know for sure?
---
Jeez calm down its just something i thought was cool wasnt try to flex if i was i wouldve linked my account or something like that
---
Damn you got downvoted into Oblivion. Have an upvote, it's on the house.
---
We matched them twice, each time my internet kicked off, my internet is fine until they lose a round and I start contacting destiny server, moments later I’m offline
---
Saved it with the edit
---
Dont worry i saved with an edit
---
Worst part is they all use erentil
---
Now u get an upvote
---
I would add that you were actually in a rumble match with 5 bots 😉
---
That should keep the secret safe
---
Perfection
---
Gambits great until recently, it seems like blade barrage is bugged because I've had completly separate enemy hunters use blade barrage multiple times in a single invasion. Just as shards of galanor get nerfed some how whiffing a blade barrage still gave full super back. I thought ill off the first person it happened with but after other random teams were doing it too my frustration was aimed at bungie
---
I hop fired a truth shot cross the map into that and killed a guy 🤭
---
Where do I sign up?
---
You post your own flex then say it doesn’t mean anything then you drag OP down too. 
---
If you don’t have anything constructive to say or contribute then why post at all?
---
Wait till Tuesday when they patch LoW.
---
They are gonna patch it again?
---
I do try to play at range, but when I run around a corner to help my teammate I just get one shot
---
I want to say "it can't be worse than that IB grenade quest", but I guess we'll see
---
Report them in game and move on.
---
my IQ is lower than my KD, 1 😎😎😎😎

I wanted the ornament clearly. I've got all exotics in the game except for astrocythe verse or however its spelled
---
You know me, sarcastic monotone guy
---
&gt; and hard to do solo
---
I should think they are, they are impossible to solo!
---
&gt; does anyone know what I should do to try and get 600 - 700 light without doing raids OR know people who will do raids?
---
This isn't Destiny 1. Raids are strictly optional. How it works is you get higher power level gear by doing any activity that lists "powerful gear" as the reward.

I’d go now since it’s on sale and you still have to buy the dlcs is you want to play their missions and quests

TO THE WINDOOOOOOW
---
I got it on my 2nd try. I'm so fucking sorry for you going through that. If you want, I can run it with you next time it comes around, if you still dont have one.
---
What you buy on steam is pre order only, you would have to wait until September.
---
What patreon tier do you get it at? Asking for a friend.

He got it at the Ahamkara Tier, telling for a friend

I mean the same thing can be made for fists of havoc or nova bomb.

Titan Slayer, Slayer of all Titans.

You, my friend, have officially broken the titan class.

That is Frigid Jackal, it comes from Sleeper nodes on Mars

It looks kind of like the Long Goodbye, but I'm not sure if that's it. [Here is a list of every sniper rifle it could potentially be](https://www.light.gg/db/category/1?etc=weapons&amp;page=1&amp;f=2%7C8%280%29%2C9%2810%29%2C4%285%3B4%3B3%3B2%29), but I am not sure how to narrow it down any more.

This is on Io

I brought the thorn up because both the thorn and the lumina leave remnants behind which need to be collected that apply the buff to the gun. You asked for an explanation on how it all works, and I explained

A little confusing considering they are trying to make it easier to know what you are buying when you first get into the game.

I'm not overclocking at all though    it's just weird

I just finished the warmind campain and no hand cannon. Just an exotic helmet for class

---
Anyone here play Marathon?!?
---
*"The viscous liquid within swirls and writhes, as if searching for escape."*
---
i would just play the 3 campaigns with your main(osiris is like 2 hours, warmind feels like 5 minutes, and forsaken has an actual "good" story") so it doesn't take that long to get up to speed
---
and you could use the boost for your second character
---
thats what i did
---
Knights, minotaurs, and captains are all susceptible to stagger, and thralls/psyons are easily cleared out with focused fire or AoEs.  In short, shoot them all in the head.
---
I always hope the victim is also in the sub.  I also hope it’s me someday.

Nah i am reserving it exclusively for fist of panic

Looks like Commander Zavala's Crochet Course paid off!

I feel your pain.... only thing I am missing and still nope :(

I don't want to preorder as I have no idea how the transition from bnet to steam will go :(

i feel this. 80+ clears across several weeks. finally got it when i popped a boon of the vanguard.

Allot of em are consumable, as for me I’ve reached 11 max
---
Yes, the faction rally catalysts were re-added to the game on June 4th. You can view currently available catalysts and where they come from in the triumphs tab of the character menu, under "account."
---
I think 12 is max and the 12th is the linked friend buff

Thank you, I’ve been looking everywhere

Was waiting for someone to do this lol. Although I hear it as

DUNNNN DUNNNNN DUN DUNNN DU DUNNNN

Same and with certain shaders it just looks like the og ghost just with a cool effect on it

Yeah, you have to get a Not On My Watch medal. This means killing an invader within 10 seconds without anyone on your team dying.

Ohhhh that makes sense. Gotta throw on a denial super on my titan I guess. Thanks for the help. I appreciate it.

im glad to see im not alone in only needing IO

Yes

Was going to get it on steam, but wasn't sure if it was playable yet. Just says pre-order currently.

I live in Victoria and I’ve found NA is much more reliable and active than ASIA servers. It’s also much easier to use lfg for NA (assuming you speak English).

Keys for chests in the underbelly of the leviathan, you get 3 keys from the leviathan raid. The chests have a chance of dropping a year 1 exotic.

Ya get it on battlenet you transfer it when it comes to steam

Destiny 1 was my first loot based game and i've loved them every since.

But takes away the knee-bash-to-face-deathlyness.

Sad Titan hours

‘Yeah boys we goteem now..’
---
...
---
‘I actually have to go guys mom’s calling, see ya’
---
I just got huckleberry and you can tear through adds with it if you're accurate enough and can kill them fast enough. I absolutely love it
---
Id recommend a really overkill heavy weapon, like 1k or Sleeper.
---
But will the ownership rights transfer from battlenet to steam? I don't want to shell out 120 total for the same thing.
---
Pinnacle weapons don’t go away.
---
For PVE it depends on what you're going for. My setups are usually based around Enhanced Ashes to Assets with 2 ordanace mods and 3 super mods so mine has Outlaw+Demolitionist but PVP is generally accepted to be Eye of the Storm and Rangefinder with a range mw.
---
I'll probably throw on 1k
---
The Recluse = SMG = 0.47s TTK... 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Say no more
---
Why the hell were all the. If destiny youtubers talking about it, and click baiting with it, then all of a sudden nothing...
---
Slightly annoyed we don’t have hawkmoon yet, we haven’t heard anything about it since the supposed “leaks”
---
One of the most popular pve loadouts uses it. Huckle, loaded question, wendigo. Its a good loadout that is relatively easy to get.
---
I mean SMGs are still monsters and not just the Recluse. Skullfort, non-stop titan shoulder chargers. Plus I don't know when the hell they buffed Sweet Business and Suros, but those things are shredding stuff right now with a moment of prefire!
---
:,(

The emblem mentions getting more drops, for you and your fireteam. More drops, more chances I would guess.
---
Retold tale is good
---
You dumb nigga get good
---
I was on bungie.net for 11 years. I even had the shield of mythics emblem in d1, was really hoping we’d have it transfer to d2.
---
Not true. I usually earned the same medals every game to progress. It just takes forever.
---
I've actually been clapping so much ass in crucible with my lonesome sidearm. If anything, sidearms are kinda underrated imo.
---
the description makes it so much worse
---
With my shitty a internet I would yeet 10 blades at one person and they would kill me and take no damage.
---
sad thing is you would have melted even more with your 4 shots of 1k and a tractor from your teammates
---
It's ok they just don't like that we finally have a panic super
---
Same here!
---
Fist of panic enters the arena
---
Well.. Finally we have a hard challenge. I have spent a good amount of time on this challenge. My team got it last night.
---
Its honestly not that bad. You just have to find "the right strat" for the encounter. For my team, it was 3 locks, 2 titans and a hunter. Go for the 2 phase, play safe, and dont take any risks. 
---
And pls, before you say " This triumph is the one that is going to keep me from shadow next Tuesday ", wait and see how bad the next challenge will be, maybe that will be harder. This is supposed to be hard, or else it would be a waste of time imo.
---
How can sidearms be dominating crucible when LoW is still out there?

So you’re the guy I keep versing in gambit!

For real, as a Hammer main since D1 I just can't change, however when I play Striker (Top Tree) I feel like I have options to play with. Sunbreaker is lacking and is either one-trick-pony Top Tree or melee-is-bugged-since-D1 Bottom Tree. Let's not got started on lack of supporting exotics dedicated to Sunbreakers.
---
Within 2 games has there only existed 2 dedicated exotics: Hallowfire Heart (Trash) and Immolation Fists (Entertaining and fun). It's infuriating that many other subclasses get interesting, synergistic exotics while Sunbreaker is left in the dust.

Should be at 6pm in UK - it is 7pm for Germany.

1. I dont play high level comp ?? Kid im top 500 elo , legend in s5,s6. Who told you shotgun play isnt something legends do ? Every scrim has not more than 1 sniper on a 3v3, and not more than 2 on a 4v4. Seems you are trying to look down upon shotgun play, so maybe you should change your condescending attitude.
---
2. Everything I post has been downvoted ? I have the most upvoted comment here : [https://www.reddit.com/r/CruciblePlaybook/comments/byimr9/beginner\_looking\_to\_improve\_at\_least\_fabled/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CruciblePlaybook/comments/byimr9/beginner_looking_to_improve_at_least_fabled/)

3. As you can see, I try to help people improve, and I dont care about downvotes, because my opinion is valuable to me and I have the freedom. There are more stupid people in the world than there are smart so if I keep getting downvotes, i dont mind :)
---
4. Proelium is unreliable - it cannot counter last word, because unlike quickplay , people in competitive know how to play their weapon's range.
---
5. So I typed a bunch of crap ? What exactly is false ? The fact that you would get owned in mythic+ competitive if you used crimson or proeluim ? Or you are too butthurt because someone here tried to counter your argument ?
---
6. """people challenging weapons outside of their effective ranges""" - this proves how stupid you are. Im not going to try to snipe you at erentil range. Im not going to challenge a sniper with a pulse rifle. And I definitely wont slide out of a corner to challenge an erentil or a fusion rifle. Thats the difference between quickplay and comp kid. In comp, people arent making dumb plays like you.
---
In a group of 4, tractor cannon is ‘eh’ unless the other three are running void weapons. With more than 4 it starts to really shine. 
---
Simplistically, it’s 3*1.33 vs 4 for non-void and 3*1.5 vs 4 for void.
---
They will be 300 and you will be 340.
---
I’m rocking my peers
---
‘Kid, kid, kid’ lmaoooo. Im not gonna dignify you with a response brother. Have a good one:) keep being a salty lil bud

K
---
So much power my phone froze
---
Oh I main Hunter, but I also play all the classes and know that there's a Triumph called "Titans Can Fly" but it seemed pretty apt in this particular moment. I've yet to "thread the needle" myself.
---
There are few things I want from destiny, as a long time player and fan of the game itself, there isn`t too much to complain about....and honestly, complaining get`s you nowhere anyway. All I want is a few of my prime weapons back from D1:
---
Vex Mythoclast
---
Necrochasm
---
Fatebringer adept
---
Fair and Square (The original crucible monster from year 1, season 1, destiny 1. Best PvP pulse of all time.)
---
Aetheon`s epilogue adept
---
and of course Gjallerhorn...because...reasons.
---
That is just disgusting in the best way possible.
---
Pretty sure I was on the other team
---
Also don't ask why we were talking about someone hunting her down
---
That's been out quite a long time now.
---
Didn't realize I shared their birthday as well until about half an hour ago lol
---
u/Noa_Zoltar Naw, that would only make sense if it was Mara's Bathwater.
---
You can pay silver to jump to 320 light, from there you'll need to play through Foresaken to get to 50.
---
If you are playing a lot of duels: Wishender + Quickdraw Handcannon
---
If you are more of a teamshooter: le monade
---
That was sick!
---
I love being a Warlock.
---
Was this a thing?
---
Curious, do you have to replay the storyline to level up your other characters?
---
I promise i only use blade barrage in strikes and blind well dps

I’ve seen people do it with nova bomb, but it’s cool to see 4 warlocks annihilating a primeval with beams of death
---
this is very good
---
That was one wack ass light show
---
Words of wisdom from the rubberbandman !
---
This is why warlock is the best class.  You could easily do a raid with just warlocks

I've always wondered like is that a thriving city where people live normal lives or is everything bland like at the tower

They did not own A. They had just lost A when he was fucking their butts with that super

Top 10 comment I have ever read.

Stormcaller is the blue one!

How does Bungie think they can be taken seriously when they sell the rights to a shit-tier company?
---
It's just RNG brother.
---
I always miss out on your guys fun :(
---
I would love if Mida would go back to its season one state
---
Oh thanks
---
Also, you need to release after 6 shots with prospector or your basically wasting dps
---
Did you clip that kill and send it to the enemy team, just so they had a little reference?
---
I am already in a clan but I am happy to join you for activities.   My GT is Diode73 and I play on XB1 in the central time zone.
---
Should I wait for destiny 2 to get on steam? If I get it on battle.net will it transfer to steam?
---
See i want to like this but all my head is saying it “stupid fucking spawn-location algorithm”
---
Jesus that super is broken. Place crosshairs within 5 meters of target and launch a gallarhorn projectile that will track and kill everyone in this continent.
---
Gracias amigo
---
yep it will transfer to steam if you start playing now.
---
not if you hyphen it!
---
How did we get here?
---
It’s already dead stahp it :(
---
How about wall hacks and invincibility, kind of like oem. I'd love an exotic that would allow tempest strike to be a one-hit.
---
I have seen screenshots from people who didn't own DLC not being able to buy that DLC's exotics from Xur. Before everyone had CoO and Warmind, if Xur sold exotics from those DLCs, people without the DLC could not get it. The item would appear greyed out and not purchase-able. Now, Forsaken exotics are like that.
---
I just want shax’s bath water
---
I’ve noticed this, especially in Crucible. I see other players flick across the map.
---
Should be wearing transversives.
---
To access those activities you would need the annual pass. To my understanding it's 30 dollars, unless the collection you're gonna buy has it (which honestly I don't know much about) then you don't need to worry about it. The annual pass isn't necessary at all, but if you manage to catch up to everything you're probably gonna want it. Just play the game first, get a feel for everything, and make the decision for the pass later on down the line
---
you have NO idea how annoying it is to hear hunters whine about not having a OHK ability.
---
#SO WHAT?! YOU HAVE THE BEST NEUTRAL GAME EXOTICS IN THE ENTIRE GAME.
---
I've bought forsaken on pc, and preordered on Console. So if I move the Console characters to pc, I can play forsaken? Or if I move the pc characters to xbox I get the preorder perks?
---
Don’t be offended it’s probably a titan main posting and as hunter mains we know we don’t need to make panic slam memes because they already know...
---
This isn't an LFG sub.
---
Rule 14.
---
those are ones though
---
I’m coming for you Randal. I’m coming.
---
It does what it does for that reason exactly, bungie doesn't want too many two tapping guns hence why Luna's howl and not forgotten and Ace were all nerfed in the first place. If you want a 340 that feels as powerful as your asking for than grind out redrix broadsword and try to get a roll with Arrowhead brake and ricochet rounds. 340 pulses have one of the top time to kills in PvP at .67 seconds with 6 headshots but they have one of the worse time to kills if you hit all body shots. In my opinion high impact are a risk reward frame just like 110 hand cannons with rampage
---
Wait what's confirming this?
---
&gt;hundreds of hours of game play
---
King Rrrrrrichard!
---
UNLIMITED POWERRRRRR!!!!- (TERRY CREWES voice)
---
I did the exact same thing, for the exact same reason.  It took about 20 hrs to get mine back up to max light and complete Forsaken using the boost. But, I also did most of the orange and blue missions along the way, which are not necessary, as well as weekly milestones that I could do.  There are a lot more ways to get power engrams than there were.  
---
Using the boost you get lvl 30 and light lvl 300.  You can equip your horror story and thunderlord if you have them immediately (regardless of light).  If they are not in your inventory, but available in collections, buy them on your highest light character to put on your new titan.  You can then buy blues from collections to hit highest attainable light before you ever begin.  Higher light means quicker run though of the story.
---
Redrix broadsword and Einstein D as far as I know that are viable in crucible in the current sandbox
---
Has your second character completed the forsaken campaign/unlocked the dreaming city and has your main completely finished the chalice quest. 
---
Those are the first two things I would try anyway.
---
Shhh male Titans are too THICC had to slim down and get a sex change
---
I’m a simple man. I see Dead Space, I upvote
---
Absolutely.  So glad Bungie added them.
---
I CAN FEEL IT IN MY BONES!!!
---
Is that what they are? I love them. They’re the only reason I was able to get 25 precision kills with a handcannon for Ace of Spades! Thanks bots
---
In the end, buying the pack with the pass or without it, you're probably getting a way better deal than most of us 
---
\*cries in 60 dollar vanilla day 1 pre-order\*
---
That's true, but since they added in the tie breaker instead of a full third round I think that regular gambit is a lot more enjoyable, as the difference between a round two win and round three win is like 3 minutes.
---
if everyone didnt unanimously agree that they are just farming they have no excuse to be mad
---
And they say nerf titan
---
Yes, thank you captain. Didn't think I would have known without you here.
---
It's right there, right behind the, um...
---
It's next to the...
---
Where tf is  your cape?  
---
No cape, no Hunter.  Them's the rules...
---
I slid directly at an erentil, said I died by a different enemy player but also by misadventure lolol, but everyone can keep crying about our OEM even though it's the only thing that works properly and works well
---
Oh yeah for sure. Either way it appears to be a very good value.
---
I honestly can't get it to work. I deflected 1 blade barrage in my life as a titan and that's it. They need to buff the activation and length time on these things.
---
Outbreak is definitely the most versatile. Loaded question and wendigo are great when paired with that. But if ure getting bored id say try for risk runner, tarrabah, or recluse in ure energy slot. SMGs are pretty good right now. Just change ure kinetic to a threat level or imperial decree
---
Nice man! You got future imperfect
---
ok yeah
---
They do have an excuse, they searched for quite some time to get some farming done and someone comes and ruins it.
---
This is what I say to current nay sayers because the game started bad: it's not how it started, it's where it currently is. There's no shame for liking a game in it's current state, even if it had a rough/bad start.
---
Kinda makes me think about Anthem. In all honesty, I hope Anthem does improve like D2 did and adds a ton of stuff and can actually compete with other looter shooters. It's unlikely since it's EA and they're turning towards "surprise mechanics"...but a guardian can dream.
---
I studied 3d modeling. In short,  this is a UV Texture map. The numbers are there to see stretchin. Since you are applying a 2D texture to a 3d object, you want to make sure your textures maps arent distorted or warped prior to applying your real texture.
---
I play Gambit and pve with a Warlock, some pve stuff with a Hunter and pvp with a Titan only because it seems thats how bungie makes this game out to be. ٩(◔‸◔)۶
---
What are you talking about? This is just what happens every time you play this strike.
---
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT CABAL ATTACK THAT DELETED YOUR VAULT? IT WAS ME, BARRY
---
[Battle.net](https://Battle.net) has the Forsaken Complete Collection for around $40.00.  It includes everything from Y1 &amp; Y2.  They tell you on the website that you will play on [battle.net](https://battle.net) until Sept 17, then it will move to Steam.
---
Still waiting to get that one for my Wayfarer.   Getting one Braytech Schematic per day makes the soul weary...
---
Holy crap this is super cool
---
Does it also come with the forsaken annual pass?
---
Feels.  There is always tomorrow...
---
Fourlock.
---
I'm waiting for my buddy to code of the missile super across the gap and get smacked by a rock. Its bound to happen sooner or later. And it shall be most hilarious.
---
Now I may be wrong here.
---
But I believe this is the one and only public event that exists on Mercury, and Mercury alone.
---
So if you missed it, its understandable.
---
COO &amp; Warmind will not be "free to play" until Sept 17th.  You have to either purchase the DLCs, purchase Forsaken, or pre-order Shadowkeep to get them right now.
---
but why
---
Played it enough when it was out
---
I can't wait to see the changes to my boi GG.
---
Impact: yes
---
I don't think it's good, but it's a requirement for the wayfarer title
---
You forgot lumina and truth
---
Yeah like 60% of the time you’ll get all 4 with GG.
---
SO MANY!
---
😂 Same.
---
*sits in the corner, waiting for the catalyst to drop*
---
Exactly me
---
I'm obsessed with outbreak perfected so I'd recommend trying that out
---
The numbers are arbitrary. They're just a simple pattern that is used to catch unwanted deformations in your texture. Checkerboard is sometimes used but numbers are seen as more useful because its easier to tell when a number 3 is distorted than a black square on a checkerboard. 
---
Source: 3d Professional for 7 years.
---
The idea is to not have any sort of stretching/distortion at all. When I learned 3D modeling stuff we just used a simple black/white checkerboard pattern to do this, just by seeing what edges weren't straight, or if the boxes were different sizes. The numbers just probably make it easier to see any sort of distortion.
---
No, the numbers are there so your brain can recognize a stretched or misaligned texture. Because humans can instantly recognize if a number doesn't look right, but if it was just a flat color you'd see nothing wrong.
---
Beans of the cool variety
---
That actually would be dope. Like a band of red legion troops or like the vex or something would be really cool
---
The numbers don’t represent anything - they serve as a guide. When texture is flattened that grid pattern will *not* be straight and the numbers are points of reference.
---
he had -99 karma now
---
Well you're using the wrong super then, if multikills is what you're going for the spec blades, arc staff or golden gun would all be better than blade barrage.
---
Blade Barrage is really only good for countering other supers, which can be extremely helpful for your team. On top of that it probably has the worst neutral game out of all the hunter subclasses.
---
Yes!!! I hit a arc strider with 2 rockets from my bad omens and he still killed me.
---
Mountaintops in a well is way more disgusting, done it with 2, haven't done it with 4, but if you ran 4 mountaintops in a well with a melting point or tractor cannon I'd imagine it'd put 4 chaos reaches to shame
---
Dang that’s a shame.
---
But thanks for the info!
---
No it's absolutely not justifed. There isn't even a mercy rule on this game mode. Fix it bungo or I keep leaving my random team
---
Underrated comment!
---
Im talking about the Ogres internet. Was attempting humor.
---
if only aggressive frame pulses like blast furnace didn't put literally all 340's out of a job... they are way too forgiving imo.
---
yesss I need cayde7
---
Nice to see this meme used without talking shit on Titans.
---
Moon’s haunted.
---
“Get out of my swamp.” Would’ve been a better approach. ;) 
---
Lol nice try
---
So you're saying the game needs to automatically detect when you don't play for a period of time, then when it automatically detects that you are logging in after some arbitrary hiatus, it now needs to compile a custom list of patch notes just for you to detail everything that has changed and summarize it for you in a neat little paragraph? And it does this every single time you decide to take a break from the game?
---
At some point you need to take responsibility for yourself. Stop expecting others to do all the work for you and spend some time going through patch notes. I know for a fact the /r/Destinythegame sub-reddit has a "Returning players guide" that sums up exactly what people have missed each season. You could have looked for that to find a summary of all the changes.
---
Its whatever, I just personally find it very offputting when people try to make others do their work for them. When I want to learn more about this game I am always googling things and searching the reddit pages for answers and only when I cannot find that answer after about 10 solid minutes of work would I even consider posting it here for others to answer.
---
I feel like anyone related to content at Bungie would call us idiots though lol. I can’t imagine they haven’t thought of it
---
Naturally. This character’s business end is studded like the walls of a Hive nest. For her pleasure, of course.
---
Have you done the Ace in the hole mission in love on Titan?
---
Just at 2000 in D2 alone.
---
Uh... What power level were you that you couldn't kill it?
---
Hahah. Dude. Wtf. That’s amazing. But you better tell me you’ve played other things too. Like GoW or RDR2??
---
r/phallanxed
---
Interesting
---
Ps4
---
When the sparrow 150 speed
---
Literally
---
I haven't played anything since Destiny 1 released except for Destiny and Assassin's Creed. I platinum every AC. I have a huge backlog. I need to play Horizon Zero Dawn and Darksiders 3, Spiderman and Shadows. Sekiro, Ghosts of Tsushima, Death Stranding and Cyberpunk
---
It sounds like your blaming pvp for the nerf of.. anything ever?? A ton of balancing has everything to do with pve performance and power creep management. Just sayin
---
This makes like the 4th video I've seen this exact same thing happen. 
---
Bungie, the knockback scale is something that really needs to be looked into.
---
Dude. For sho. Lots of good games out there.
---
You know what comes after that in that cut scene, right?
---
Titan Exotics are bungies Redheaded Stepchild.
---
Note: don't get up your ass, I didn't invent that expression.
---
I know. That’s why I chose this exact template
---
I’ll dump all of my bright dust just for this
---
12 kills, top fragged that game.
---
"FALCON PUNCH!"
---
PC
---
So there’s actually a person who choose all those idiotic spots for the shader to apply? Geez
---
This emote is the only thing I want from these Engrams and I'm getting ships, sparrows and terrible rolled gear. Bungie pls, don't pull a Niflheim on me
---
I'd love more than 9, and I feel the vault pain. But I don't think this is happening
---
Thread is answered, thanks to /u/shadowed11312 and /u/XxJ-NutxX. 
---
Thank y'all both!
---
Locking thread since there's really no more to say.
---
With the recent upgrades to striker Titan, where you can run around for like 2 mins in your super it  seems to be the favorite. I’m hoping for a return to bubble titans being used frequently
---
You okay mate? It seems as though you have quite a bit of pent up aggression there, and there’s no way that’s healthy.

---
These types of camos should just be an obtainable shader in the game. That looks awesome.
---
Correction. It is The Black Gate, Minas Morgul, and the Mouth of Sauron :P
---
I don't understand. I am so good with my scout rifles, and sidearms, and smgs...
---
I have all the DLC I'm pretty sure. I bought discounted 100$ "Complete edition" for 40 dollars and I'm pretty sure it includes all current content right? Anyways, thanks for your reply I don't know how I am meant to keep up with the rate of light level that these quests are scaling is my biggest question. They are going up 10 levels per quest and my average is only going up like 3-4 per quest. IDK
---
You can get it. It will just reset after every season. So if your one kill or something away from completing it. It will reset to zero
---
The Jerky step of the quest has been bugged since the release of Season of Opulence, unfortunately. Bungie is aware of the issue.
---
Locking thread since there's nothing more to be said :/ .
---
Damn. I mostly play on PS4 cause my PC is trash, running the game at around 15 fps. As for organizing a fireteam, r/fireteams or the Bungie app are probably your best choices. Unless you have friends...

its primary

---
i havent even used loaded question yet and ive done the quest on all three characters. guess i have to break one out
---
I had to delete my warlock, decided to go for a classic looking human, nothing special but nothing I’ll regret
---
Play the forsaken story then
---
I did not
---
Oh piss off
---
- It is very very very PvE oriented. PvP is currently lacking but that is going to be addressed soon. This is a looter shooter, so PvE all the way.
---
- Future of the game is very stable. It'll be around for a while. They are moving from bnet to Steam if you're on PC. Other than that they're still releasing content later this year so no sign of stopping.
---
- There are achievements called triumphs. There are tons and tons. Most give points that aren't used for anything other than bragging rights but some give emblems and goodies. There are titles! they are hard to get but definitely for flexing.
---
- Endgame is more than just raids, but that's a major part and only done at endgame. There are quests, activities and grinding to do, guardian.
---
- Here's my first point of bad news. This game isn't the best f2p. You're best off putting down the money for Forsaken and the Annual Pass. You will thank me. Take this from a f2p player.
---
- Community is great! There are always helpful people. Good clans are easy to find, there's Discord servers for LFG, anything you need is accessible.
---
Neat
---
Feel free to send me one after 😂
---
/r/blursedimages was what I was referring to lol.
---
You got it!
---
Omg it's in my pursuits, the arms dealer strike. Thanks
---
I'm going to guess your on console so, is erentil super popular too on console?
---
Umm ok
---
^^^ you deserve a high five breh 🖐️
---
Unpopular opinion: The javelin from DS2 was the most satisfying weapon to use in Dead Space. I swear, this f#cking gun could be in any game, I'd use it.
---
Ahh ok, never new this existed in here!
---
You’re def right but he’s just pointing out how much of a little bitch that destiny can be sometimes. Don’t deny it, you know it to be true.
---
Nice flag, where’s it from?
---
Could it be... Tex Markerna?
---
Definitely keep us updated because I'm always fascinated on how these printers work
---
Thanks 😂
---
Confirmed: Crushinator is a vex

lfg to cheese wendigo in the blind well in corrupted strike

Aight cool ill have to get em both

I’ve hit a tensies (10x kill streak) before on my Titan and got the quote from Shaxx saying “With ten hunters like you!!!!....”
