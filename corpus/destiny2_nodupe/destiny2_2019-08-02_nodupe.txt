100 isn‚Äôt that many, especially when your team is getting 10-15 per run, not to mention you have other EAZ bounties and will be getting it passively.

i NE'd
---
He means that soon you will be able to change the perks. Look up armor 2.0.
---
I‚Äôm so stoked I switched to Titan main. I‚Äôm so ready to be a fucking astronaut man! Hunter looks cool too. I feel like the Warlock would be better if they just took off that weird looking mask from the helmet.
---
Imagine the power of A single ghost shell capable of crashing every single guardian in the tower in an instant.
---
You will be able to change the perks with armor 2.0.

If I Own Everything But Shadowkeep and I Want to Transfer to PC From Xbox, Will I Only Have To Rebuy Forsaken And Y2 AP?
---
not to mention everyone leaving after the "miniboss phase" and just skipping the chests since you require double the amount of bosses killed vs chests found.
---
Yes because not supporting shitty business practice makes you childish.
---
If So, should I Buy Forsaken and Y2 AP On B.net now or wait until Shadowkeep's Launch?
---
Exactly! Those 3
---
They‚Äôre fully embracing the RPG elements, you can build a build to fit your play style and match it with armor mods, haven‚Äôt seen much but looks very promising. I would watch the most recent ViDoc if I were you
---
How long can you get this sparrow? My Xbox is out of commission but I don't want to miss out
---
I think u missed the part where I was saying I do this solo.  10 to 15? You‚Äôre kidding right? Im lucky if I get 4!
---
Exactly, it‚Äôs such a mess
---
Bungie-works tirelessly on entire solstice event 
---
Us- OwO tiny sparrow!
---
Mine was, they‚Äôre like letters so they‚Äôre in a separate slot of the postmaster
---
How do I get it!!??!????
---
Welp I just took the plunge. Thanks!
---
I lol'd so hard when I first saw some random guardian driving one of these. I just had to get it, I haven't done a single thing for the solstice event except just get the first armor piece from the tower. I dont give a shit about grinding out all the other pieces, I'm just happy I've got the mini-birb.
---
Ok?
---
Right. Error code: Fabulous

Nice

i thought the pvp orbs can be done in both crucible and gambit
---
doesn't work, got guitared 3 times in the EAZ from what i assume was all the orbs from the servitor boss
---
Better be a 110
---
Ahamkara on fruit

Like I replied on Twitter, "Slow and polished wins the race!"
---
Missed opportunity for "Way of a thousand chanclas"
---
LMAO!
---
zero two‚Äôs fat ass is spooky too
---
I immediately plopped down the silver for this
---
Great already put in pto now I have the week off for nothing. What do you expect me to do spend time with my kids?
---
Better not be a 180
---
I honestly thought it was a repost until I saw it was the same op lmao
---
I preordered the digital edition already üòÇ I love this game wayyyy to much
---
I think it ends on the 27th of August
---
I could be butchering the term or mashing two terms together. But essentially, these people are AFK players that either use a script to mimic movement or just don't do anything at all.

What about snapshot rampage.  I was in comp and the enemy had the exact roll and was destroying me. Felt like he got his shots off much faster.
---
wont include forsaken
---
Better be a 150
---
I like to think that's how other players feel when they finally kill me in PVP when i'm on a 20+ kill streak lmao
---
Always love the guys who take not playing as though it was a protest march. What do we want? A better Crucible!! When do we want it? With Shadowkeep!!
---
Did you actually TM it? I didn‚Äôt think so...
---
May RNGsus bless you child
---
Haha whatever makes you happy
---
Bungie extended Moments of Triumph till the 17th of September, just go at it one at a time
---
Why should they be punished? They brought up an unpolished product which most people paid for and made it in a way that this mistake would reverted like it never happened. The menagerie chest exploit goes under the same category and could have been solved the very same way. And it is something they have to solve in order to make their game better. Have (more) game testers. Prometheus Lens bug back in the day also falls under it and Lord of wolves although not being a bug, it was still a hideous thing that never had to happen. Conclusion game testing is something they have to focus on.
---
May RNGesus bless us all.
---
You ever been hit by one of those...on the thigh...
---
It hurts.
---
Sure, but it‚Äôs not exactly ‚Äúimpressive‚Äù in my opinion if you don‚Äôt almost exclusively use blink, that‚Äôs just my opinion though.
---
Anthem is a game I genuinely WANTED to succeed, I wanted to love this game so badly, but EA and Bioshock fucked it up completely.
---
i think they‚Äôre giving the emblems out throughout the week and not on a specific day. i still haven‚Äôt gotten my LoW emblem but i played Iron Banner so the only thing i can do is wait
---
Yep. Fun as hell for the first few hours because of it's movement being satisfying af, but after that it's straight meh at best
---
Congrats!
---
My team achieved this last week too!
---
Unfortunately I still need shuro chi challenge for rivensbane and it has so far proved obnoxious.
---
You misspelled salvation
---
JUST got that shell today. Still no "Selfie", but that 10% EXP boost may come in handy...
---
You ever been hit by a shoe?
---
At least we got good solstice armour though. Only need 300 strike kills to get the set majestic and the game decides to fecking update.
---
Thanks so much. We are also stuck on the shuro chi challenge,but we are getting closer every attempt.
---
I'll try!
---
Well, that was also EA. BioWare isn't their own publisher, though if it was, they probably could've shipped it with less bugs and, well, better content.
---
You still don't give any reason for their punishment. Stuff getting exploited is sadly a status quo and you know it's not like they hurt others with these. Some even bring positive feedback. The menagerie was well received by both sides and could be seen as a good exploit. The tribute hall exploit sucks because one had to use all their resources whilst others didn't, yet that has been reverted and they still have to do it if they want to have all of that. You want punishment where to was no harm done at all. Genuinely pve exploits need no punishment imo, because most could have eventually been fixed and only hurt indirectly those who didn't use them.
---
Already bought it
---
How about no
---
Yea I‚Äôm have the same issue for both emblems
---
Cool! I made a emblem for people who use Erintil
---

---
Just remember to pick it up on the characters you need the exotic. If you pick up one on your hunter for instance, and he/she has all the exotics, you'll get a duplicate. I have all on my warlock and hunter, so I'm picking them up on my titan, since she's missing some.
---
A smaller hit box would technically lead to an unfair advantage/changing the game, because enemies wouldn‚Äôt be able to hit your sparrow as easily, making it a more ideal sparrow to ride through crowded areas in strikes. I wish it could be
---
This new armor looks like our guardians are doing a dumpster dive for the next expansion
---
Wow thanks so much
---
It was nerfed, btw. Health and shield are not instantaneous anymore
---
The engram gives you a Year 1 or Forsaken random drop exotic (no raid or quest exotics, and nothing after Forsaken) that you don't already own (armor for  only the class you buy it on). If you have all the year 1 and Forsaken random drop exotics for that class, you get a dupe.
---
You're welcome. üòä
---
I‚Äôm getting all spooked thinking about it
---
I know that. I have already gotten the Laser Tag emblem from it and I have it equipped. I just didn't get the LoW emblem
---
I usually get 5-8 b myself, the other two teammates are always running together instead of splitting up and getting multiple bosses at once, the minibuses are extremely easy to kill.
---
Does it charge to max health and shield even if your hit while it‚Äôs charging?
---
my friend and i were grinding through the gambit matches with mixed success, so your plan honestly sounds golden
---
Tess has it, if i were you if you don‚Äôt have enough bright dust and she isn‚Äôt selling it just dismantle ghosts and other sparrows. you get like 100 bright dust a piece
---
Could even also be that they want to give it that little more breathing room after the release of a big game like BL3? So more players will get on it?
---
Well I figured heroic public events because that‚Äôs another step and the patrols because, on hunter, you need to do 10 on the EDZ
---
Yes, it carries over
---
Awesome, thanks for letting me know!
---
That too! Good thinking. I'm actually on that step right now lol
---
Have fun. Pro tip, don‚Äôt use titan barricades/bubbles. They count as allies and fail the challenge if they get hit. Also, for the second damage phase for the second level, use a bottom tree dawnblade to clear out the psions. It took me four hours to get it so good luck. (The real Rivensbane challenge is getting the ship and sparrow for me)
---
You know why the moon is haunted? All the guardians brought their ghosts
---
Bungie didn‚Äôt ruin it, the lazy people using a macro did.
---
Haunted forest
---
Yep I learned this the hard way.
---
Twice I tried to ‚Äòplay it safe‚Äô with a bubble in the open area before the final damage phase before realising the bubble getting hit was failing the challenge.
---
Completely terrible design, shocking oversight.
---
Yeah same for me. Nothing is working, I tried everything except reinstalling the launcher/ game. Kinda shitty.
---
I mean, it‚Äôs literally supposed to be a protective dome which you would think protects the players from being hit by the big thing they‚Äôre not allowed to be hit by.
---
Stupid that it does the complete opposite.
---
Yikes..
---
I was saying this exact thing last night
---
Except that that‚Äôs not true at all. Bioware fucked around for 7 years and had poor management so they had to make a game in like 10 months. Almost Every decision that was made was theirs.
---
Now now no need for name calling... and you say I'm toxic......
---
It's simple, if people don't afk then no punishment should be dealt.
---
And again your assuming that all players on a team think alike, it would be more prevalent in clan/ready made fireteams of 3, and again your assuming every player is going to be a d***.
---
So it's ok in your mind that those that afk, that effects the outcome for the players that are playing to not face the consequences of their actions (or lack of), let me guess, your getting wound up because you afk.....??
---
Happened to a few clan members yesterday. Try restarting
---
Thanks. I look forward to giving it a shot
---
About that, what race is Shaxx ? And please don't tell me his race is Shaxx.
---
That's what I want to know.
---
Wtf the titan one looks way worse than the warlock
---
What is this sparrow???
---
Unfortunately not :/
---
His race is 
---
# THE CRUCIBLE.
---
I like the hunter helmet
---
Thanks :)
---
Idk if this will happen to you but when opulence drooped the last forge which has the longest grind unlocked automaticaly for me.
---
My original question became redundant after learning that the Annual Pass is included with the Forsaken Complete Edition bundle, which was the one I purchased. Sorry for wasting your time to explain all of this to a noob like me. ):
---
I think that‚Äôs a lingering effect of when D2 launched and shotguns were considered heavy weapons.
---
Youre a madman! The warlock is the best! He looks like he's ready for a fight, a flight to the moon, and a masquerade all at the same time!
---
Oh I was unaware it already came bundled. And don‚Äôt be sorry for wasting our time! If we found this a waste of time we wouldn‚Äôt go around answering questions lol
---
I can‚Äôt have it.  I‚Äôm for 5 weeks not at home.
---
Frank please
---
Keep in mind; Bungie CONSTANTLY changes the meta and moves it from one end of the spectrum of weapons and perks to the other. So although Headseaker has been lousy in D2 since day one, I would still hold onto any theoretically beastly god-rolls that contain Heaseaker for when it gets buffed. Because it will be, sooner or later.
---
Yeah think i read something somewhere about some stuff auto-unlocking at some point. Dunno if that is correct tho. Find it hard to single out a decent guide for Forsaken-up to now, but i‚Äôll figure that out :)
---
Now I just want it more
---
Will moments of triumph be extended too?
---
Warlock is my main lol

I pre-ordered it already

You might want to read "Children of Time", where a sentient species of spiders is one of the main protagonist species.

I hope it does not trigger you into burning down the library, afterwards.

I'm part of a US based (est) clan with 90+ ACTIVE members that regularly raid. If 4pm-12am est timezone works, I'm happy to send you an invite.
---
...Oh. Thank you.
---
The warlock looks like they got frisky with Eris and put the wrong Armour on.
---
So, you'd rather eat a grenade, use your rift which keeps you locked in place and primed for getting sniped or shotgunned, and throw out your exotic slot for a ton of other way stronger exotic armors for a warlock. Or, just put on one helmet and double up on a rampage weapon anyways? You are intentionally downplaying the raw utility that OEM has.
---
How‚Äôd you get the emblem
---
Guys ever think his ghost said ‚ÄúI think they are trying to tempt us‚Äù before he is allowed to pick up the axe?
---
I as a Titan main am pretty disappointed with the Titan armor
---
I think your missing the point. When you can make the same amount or more off cosmetics don‚Äôt you start to rethink development? Don‚Äôt you hire more people to make cosmetics? Doesn‚Äôt that become a higher priority than say, hiring more crucible team members. Seasons are going to be optional now, Eververse is about to not become live event funding, but entire game funding.
---
what shader do you have on?
---
Does this apply to crucible resets? Does each reset have to be using the same character?
---
Militia birthright. I always go in pvp with this loadout. Had it ever since Militia was added to NF loot.

I roam solo 24:7 and face stacks 24/7. One blinking nade will suppress tight moving unit. Normally drop one too. You‚Äôd think many when stacking would split by now LMAO.

Tim: "RAAAAAAGGGGGGHHHHHHHH!!!!!"
---
Wait... IT'S TREASON THEN!
---
If you get within 120 points of it and wait until weekly reset. As long as you‚Äôve played 3 games that week you should get 120 glory at reset.
---
Honestly its all the reason I need. Get off our moon, spooky hive/taken ghosts.
---
Voooooooopppp...
---
I missed it the first week of the game when Xur sold it. After I got it, though, I had another one drop a few weeks after that and then Xur sold it again a week or two before D2 came out. Then there was the iron gally for rise of iron. 
---
I do find it funny though that they didn‚Äôt let us transfer our collections forward but are slowly bringing back all of these legendaries and exotics every season. But, they should focus more on new exotics that have only been mentioned in lore entries and bring those in game like they did with rose.
---
That looks like one of those coin operated rides you find outside of coffee shops in Europe... Does it play a little tune while you ride?? üòÇ
---
OH, IT'S BECAUSE HE'S BLACK, AIN'T IT?

P.D.: Actually, the helmet was fucking dope
---
FFS.... Shadowkeep isn't coming before 1 of October now -.-

Isn't that a fennec?

Please don‚Äôt remind of getting blue screened every 10 seconds
---
Actually, do we know how old is sAladdin?
---
I have been playing Destiny on Xbox since the Beta for Destiny 1 my friend.
---
Low key hate the way the finished armor looks I wish u could just have it look like normal
---
Funny thing is, they delayed there game like 3 times and it still ended up trash since the development didn‚Äôt actually start till 9 months before the game came out
---
It was pretty much the middle tree Hammers super, minus the swinging.
---
This. If you removed the helmet you would just see an autonomous pile of grenades.
---
Feel bad for all dem peeps that said Anthem would be the death of Destiny.
---
Just get more bright dust 4head
---
Or Shax X. So Shax 10.
---
Looks like she will have curated roles
---
I lowkey love it.
---
Hate it when dickholes do this. Thanks for letting us know in advance.

is that mans about to throw knives made of gold at me

r/SharditKeepit
---
Yeah and the grind is mostly just "play destiny."
---
Ah ok cheers
---
I mean it would be good for Nightfalls with match game, but that's about it really.
---
Yep they really didn't think that mini boss requirement through. Goes waaaay faster if you leave as soon as the first part is done. 
---
Coupled with Solstice packages being near useless anyway XD
---
Yup that's me.
---
sharts in rally banner
---
How to acquire
---
Glad I have been consistently doing this and regularly sit on 5k bright dust.
---
Yes yes I‚Äôve read the lore.
---
Psh... real ones do the Cabal Engineer exploit for an hour
---
Sloth face
---
Oof. If you really want to you can try to solo zero hour. Try to LFG, but if it really doesn‚Äôt work after maybe an hour or so, look up some guides to solo it. Also do iron banner for spike grenades swarm.
---
Would say Erentil is the most OP, followed closely by masterworked Wardcliff

My proudest achivement yet is the Bergusia Forge.

And one day, ill manage to get my trusty steed to the oracle engine, im sure of it haha
---
I have bought D2 and Osiris/Warmind on PS4.  
---
Later when I upgraded my PC I got free bundled D2 with DLCs.   
---
I already connected those accounts on Bungie website.   
---
Can I buy Forsaken on PS4 account and have it migrated to Steam? What will happen?   
---
I can't figure it out when it comes to season passes/dlcs, they made it so opaque, I really don't know anymore what im buying/Paying for.
---
Man had like 2500 and was saving it for the final piece of the eververse armor I needed but then the sparrow came out and maaaan. And I still gotta do the fucking tributes
---
Oh definitely not

People are hating on the space boi armor but i think it looks rad also
---
Awesome!
---
Yea. I have never been a PvP player in Destiny unless was doing a quest step for anything so I can‚Äôt fully comment on PvP but I do see a lot of complaints about Titans in PvP
---
She would, but the problem is that she would have to die first.
---
Nobody has the balls to make that happen.
---
That hunter helmet.... definitely switching it for celestial nighthawk.... still would fit in more than this new helmet....
---
It's easy math guardian
---
And you're a valued member of our community chief, keep up the great work :)
---
In terms of price of asset per dollar, no cosmetic DLC is worth it.
---
Just use the subclass and weapons with that element
---
You can get a refund if you bought it VERY recently, or at least that's how it works on PC. 
---
You do not get your money back if you bought it a long time ago. When they made the year 1 DLC free with purchase of Forsaken last year, those of us who bought it separately got some unique in game cosmetics and some "pity consumables," as I call them. No idea if that's going to happen again.
---
Titans be like : Me big! Me smash!
---
Everyone else: Buddy, that‚Äôs a statue...
---
Thanks. I‚Äôll try that.
---
One more question will I need forsaken to get power level 750 when shadowkeep is released or not.
---
Welp better get back on that grind then
---
Shattered throne is available during the third week of the three week curse cycle. You can view the current curse level in the top right corner of the weekly reset infographic stickied to this subreddit. You can also tell by what the Dreaming City looks like and where Petra stands.
---
Yeah, but isnt something like if i dont use subclass of daily element my playlist strike kills wont count
---
If you have a fireteam that you‚Äôre communicating with you can try for the corrupted strike and go to the blindwell instead of doing the strike.
---
I‚Äôm not gonna join if it‚Äôs on pc since pretty much everyone will be on pc, srry
---
We ran a scourge and everyone used that. Hilarity ensues
---
Problem is i dont have a fireteam but thx on help
---
I love it!
---
I've not been on in months and signed in yesterday, bought 30quid worth of silver and bought the mini after seeing it in a video and soon realised everyone was buying it with bright dust so got my refund
---
but it do be like that sometimes
---
Wouldn‚Äôt work as the sparrows are buyable using bright dust, so how would it work and not be pay to win?
---
Warlocks can for certain, one of there melee abilities allows for a one shot under a certain resliance, on top that yeah, the two arc strider ones can both kill in one melee if you have been shot by anything at least once, yes titans have their charges, but none of our abilities actually do more damage besides that, so if we dont shoulder charge, we dont have any increased melee
---
*copied from my clanmate in our group chat*
---
Farm EAZ Mini Bosses
---
Find a Cabal infested EAZ
---
Proceed to the Boss Fight. Bosses MUST be the 3 Rocket/Shield Brothers
---
Kill 2 of the 3 Bosses
---
Look for the yellow bar engineer Psion. You'll see a prompt saying, "An Engineer Arrives to support the Cabal" in the lower left hand corner when he spawns. He comes in on a Cabal Transport ship. You can't miss him. He also has unique abilities like placing turrets and Giant orange cylinder barriers.
---
Kill the Engineer Psion
---
Repeat (Steps 4 and 5).
---
PS: Psion will respawn with the players, so stick together preferably in the middle of the map where the Loot Chest spawns after killing the bosses. He respawns pretty quick 20-30 seconds.
---
Hoes mad
---
This armor looks nice
---
Nope, the singe is just that element causes more damage to enemies but just use the element you want for the orbs you want
---
soloing to recluse was surprisingly easy
---
I tried r/destinytechsupport but it just keeps saying my post failed for no reason.
---
As long as you stay above 1980, the points on reset will put you above 2100 (you gain 120). 
---
You lose something like 52 on a loss.  You can play a couple games and hope for the win as long as you make sure you don‚Äôt drop below that. Either you get it now or, at the latest, at reset. 
---
Wins are a little more than losses as well. With you at 2098, if you win either of those two matches, you will have it with no risk of losing it if you don‚Äôt.
---
Lol my friend changed his gamertag to "scooty pooh" and now i need to see scooty pooh on the scooty puff jr
---
Everybody gangster till the Blade Barrage start flyin
---
What he means is the progress indicator on the armour does not specify guardians.
---
Seems this was a typo in the description only.
---
Depending on your platform you should be able to restore the license and it should be fine. I've had this occur a few times on PS4 after a patch or system update.
---
Bungie said in the vidoc (more info in the stickied [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/by457o/faq_shadowkeep_cross_save_free_to_play_and_more/)) Forsaken is not required to play Shadowkeep. So you there should be a method in place when Shadowkeep drops to get to 750 for players that own Shadowkeep but not Forsaken.
---
FOR THE PUPPIES!
---
Lost sectors work too I think
---
Ah ok thanks for your help
---
how tf is he holdong a hand cannon and a Submachine gun all in one. JUST MAKE A SUBMACHINE GUN!!!
---
How can I restore my license?  Also this happened right after I updated destiny for the solstice event.
---
can u just tell me if its this week or nwxt week?
---
Masking eye has the warmask lock.
---
The warlock armor looks good too mostly, but I don't like the paper mask on the face.
---
I myself am a Titan Main and I can say that this is very accurate and a Titan ist totally worthy to hold Thor's Hammer
---
You can't see the cross
---
You can find one quickly and easily via an LFG (Looking For Group) tool. 
---
On xbox, try the built-in LFG tool on the parties tab.
---
On PS4/PC, I see people generally suggest r/fireteams or the Destiny Companion App.
---
I wait to see Year 6. Its either gonna be dope or gonna be funny maybe both.
---
So true. I‚Äôve ‚Äúquit‚Äùplaying destiny like 6 times already, play something else for a month or two and I‚Äôm back. Those breaks did allow me to experience other games like dark souls and borderlands so it‚Äôs all good
---
Yeah wish they gave us maybe 5-10 more seconds after revealing for the ones we don‚Äôt find
---
my man!
---
What‚Äôs the original picture?
---
I see, no way other that this to check? I‚Äôm assuming the curse will change with Tuesdays reset?
---
me and the anarchy are like this. 40-something times but nope.
---
Excellent,  thanks for posting this.
---
Good for you. How long did it take you to upgrade the blue to purple armor?
---
This is cropped from the TWAB image for shadowkeep.
---
Thanks!
---
That‚Äôs not difficult in the least
---
I got to blue in 10 hours, Blue to purple took the other 23
---
Yes, things that change on a weekly basis change on Tuesdays. There's some fan made infographics we sticky to this subreddit every Tuesday-Friday that have weekly reset information, such as the curse level (in super tiny print in the top right corner). There may be other websites that say what curse week it is, but besides that, checking in-game would be how you tell.
---
Friends
---
this is the first i've heard of the delay. will opulence last until then, or will there be some interregnum of seasons? either way, i'm happy. i'd love to be able to take a break, play some other games, and not miss anything.
---
I need this omg
---
Also as a Titan main I can confirm I am stuck in one right now. Please send help
---
Alright thanks guardian

Don‚Äôt forget he voiced Alan Rails as a member of the Vindicators in an episode of Rick and Morty. ‚ÄúAll aboard, motherfuckers!‚Äù I watched that episode and said Zavala?  Indeed.
---
I just got The Colony
---
I spent all my bright dust I saved for the beach ball ghost since it's the only one I now have with Guiding Light. At least the extra XP has helped get me more engrams to break down stuff for more bright dust.
---
Inb4 they complain on forums that they got banned for no reason.
---
Yeah, but with all the chatter I‚Äôve never stopped to ask someone what they‚Äôre doing. I‚Äôm usually listening hard for instructions to try to understand what to do and I don‚Äôt want to interrupt that to say ‚Äúhey who‚Äôs punching me.‚Äù Incidentally it does make listening harder so I wish people would stop.
---
Dude look no need to be salty about what i put there is just no need for it. Plus you could've approached this differently and also i took what he put into consideration. So don't be a dick head
---
It removed him from the coding.
---
Well then I'll hope you miss your shoulder charge

Upbeat community

Hunters have hands down the best jump and class ability for crucible. Warlocks and Titans don't. This is unfair.
---
Change my mind.
---
I *think* you can get the legendary gear from the solstice packages from the EAZ. I‚Äôm pretty sure you can only get them *after* you‚Äôve completed the magestic gear.
---
You can get random drops from the packages
---
Caydes duds.
---
In my super I just wack you with a shield
---
stonks ‚ÜóÔ∏è
---
&gt;Best jump
---
Based on what? Just because it‚Äôs intuitive does not mean it‚Äôs better.
---
Have you heard of titan skating?
---
Did you know that Titans are faster or are you just trolling?
---
That‚Äôs not what I asked, I asked if it was worth getting
---
Maybe make the background a slightly different color?
---
Same thing
---
Yes. Seems to have an approximate 1 in 8 from my experience, drop when you open the solstice packages after you've got the legendary set.
---
 But to be fair it'll be less useful when shadow keep drops and all our hear is wiped out.
---
Lmao, thanks for informing everyone
---
Titan skating is no longer a thing and moving fast means jack shit when a hunter can jump over your head instantly to shotgun you.
---
Where is this throne in d2?
---
*Oh you‚Äôre approaching me!*
---
Anyone still remember "I can feel his finger tips on the surface of my mind!" ?
---
God I love me some Eris Morn
---
Wait until Cross Save is explained.
---
Tess, Vuvuzela, Shaxx, Banshee, Gambit Daddy, Robo waifu, event granny, and Benedict
---
also don‚Äôt forget planetary vendors
---
Ah, 10 Nessus events for titan armor, right?
---
We're in week 2.  Next week you can do it.
---
I keep trying to tell them that their dps comes from my well but anytime I do I get yelled at for being a warlock without lunafactions which doesn‚Äôt even have to do with what I‚Äôm saying
---
You‚Äôre kidding right? 
---
Do you know the verticality of Warlocks? 
---
Don‚Äôt pretend that hunters have a special jump. It‚Äôs literally just a double jump. 
---
There aren‚Äôt any circumstances (unless supered maybe) in which a titan can not outrun a hunter.
---
Thank you for this.
---
You can ride your sparrow anywhere. I always made it a point to take my sparrow into the Hellmouth in that first area on the Moon. It was difficult but possible.
---
Imagine being so self centred
---
The word used is inconvenient not impossible.
---
And honestly if epic didn't do this, steam would continue to be a monopoly for everyone who doesn't hate drm and uses got.
---
The nightfall solution should work then, no need to mess with your clock. Just make sure it's a nightfall where you can free roam. I think will of thousands is this week so you can  run around Mars.
---
Ahh okay, I haven‚Äôt read this weeks TWAB yet.
---
Intentional typo?
---
5 years?? Damn I‚Äôm already 26 lol
---
Probably until they introduce the new raid armor in shadowkeep if it has special sockets.  It will be v2.0 so we can just power it up to new max light and use.
---
Reminds me of all the Anthem spam on the Bungie forums.
---
Just cause you're good with a subpar weapon class doesnt make it not subpar. That being said as a scout rifle fan, good shit man.
---
It‚Äôd be great, I mean now they can do it if they want to, there‚Äôs no one telling them not to
---
You're kidding... right?
---
Hangar behind dead orbit.
---
I love Warden of Nothing! Just uh.... not every ten minutes lol.
---
I sure wish Titans were more useful on Bridge. :c
---
I'm having the same exact issue and have tried this multiple times, no luck whatsoever, I'm just going to leave it and see if it finally decides to update.
---
Reminds me of my nephew saying any game with guns in space is just like halo.
---
Thank you!
---
What new exotic? I'm out of town for family vacation so i didn't have ocasion to play in Like 2 weeks
---
Oh for sure. I just meant from a technical standpoint.   
---
But yeah, it's all in their own hands now.
---
I noticed you dont have titan yet but how tf do you do 200 solar melee kills  where should I go for those and which perk tree should I use
---
What gun is that?
---
Jeez OP, don't you know jokes aren't allowed? Jesus these idiots will upvote anything I'm glad we're so much smarter than them amirite camaro
---
I like it
---
Burning maul and throw the hammer, best would be ep or just farm strikes
---
Yea that‚Äôs understandable, making games is a lot of work as well as adding and improving things so it‚Äôs still good on them for all this work
---
There were so many farewell posts on the Bungie forums about how people were leaving D2 because they felt betrayed and how Anthem will be amazing.
---
If anyone is curious by any chance.
---
Weapon: No Feelings.
---
Roll: Meyrin RDS, Steady Rounds, Rapid Hit, Zen Moment.
---
Thank you, I'm a casual player and wondering is masterwork worth it or should I just get purple and be done
---
It's almost as if Xur has appeared at the exact same time every single week since release!
---
I dont even know how the armour is gonna work with my season 4 gear, BUT WHAT HAS THIS GAME COME TO!?
---
Lol shutting down
---
Oh Jade Rabbit loves exchanges with snipers. Low key META
---
Masterwork isn't that hard honestly I don't think you need to do all of it, Maybe just one piece for the triumph
---
Well I csnt complete moments of triumphs sadly I have no one to raid with and no one willing to teach me
---
Xur decides sells the one eyed masks while I‚Äôm out of town...
---
**cuts plastic ring with Willbreaker**
---
There you go Guardian
---
Lol not from what I have read!
---
You a bitch hobblegoblin
---
You will also get the ones who will milk out Cabal matches for ages, leave one of the 3 bosses alive and a mechanic psion drops in around every 30 seconds or so, they count as a mini boss.  
---
Personally wont be skipping any parts of EAZ matches, gonna need all the packages in the world to try and get good rolls once all 3 of my characters are done.
---
Yep, that‚Äôs half a decade for ya. Time sure flies, doesn‚Äôt it?
---
Yeah, still havent checked xur but ill 100% get them
---
Unreal. Titans get oem with e. Hand cannon. Hunters get stompees with traction. Warlocks get... winter's guile.
---
Hello short end of the stick!
---
That's a default view. The actual roll is pulse targeting, pump action, and enhanced hc targeting with linear fusion and special ammo finder.
---
Stats are 1 1 1 or 0 1 2.
---
I just got wavesplitter so that has helped a bit. I plan to get some clan members and try again tonight as squanchy92 suggested.
---
I don‚Äôt have it for some reason. Even though I played during the needed hours.
---
Yes. Bungie said in a TWAB video you can work on MW after the event is done.
---
And then warlocks checked. Sadness ensues.
---
Masterwork is not automatic, check the boots. You need to apply the masterwork.
---
Yes sir. I don‚Äôt have them even though I played the hours :(
---
What's that kinetic shotty
---
Huh, I forgot I actually made a vid of this long ago 
---
https://youtu.be/Q0J1xeRJkVo
---
Hey, i do this.
---
What in the cinnamon toast fuck is this.
---
this is exactly me!
---
No you dont. Shattered  throne isnt even this week.  I have everythinhg but that mw.
---
I want an emote where I just throw rocks
---
ROFL
---
Wait can‚Äôt you pickup your amigos orbs
---
The people I know bought destiny because they like borderlands or bought borderlands because they liked destiny.
---
This looks UH MAZING!
---
It's over in the mall/town zone, just get up onto the barn roof shaped roofs and look for the broken holes, one, maybe two, spawn up there.
---
Check your triumphs. If its not there then message bungie
---
Remember when people said anthem would kill destiny? Lol
---
The links don‚Äôt lead to anything so you don‚Äôt exactly have proof
---
If you're running banner shield you can slap in taken mods to refresh grenades and just grenade spam void explosions that heal the team. It's pretty damn satisfying.
---
Atleast youre not getting a marshmallow with a burnt wrapper on the front as a helmet.
---
PC or console?
---
That's what I did for my set, I'm not gonna slog through more EAZ than I have to
---
Bungie killed Destiny just to show that not even destiny can kill destiny
---
Since of the masterwork requirements are regular game play items, just like last year, it makes since that you would be able to complete them after the event.  Last year they did not state that you could masterwork after the event before or during the event, they just gave you the requirements. 
---
Also when you consider that the event is only 3 weeks and shattered throne will be here during the second week, and that Bungie tries to make sure that things are obtainable for the casual player, you can, with relative certainty, deduce that you can masterwork after the event.
---
I get it was super tedious getting those kills, but would it kill them to stick around an extra 5 minutes?! Man lol.
---
It looks like shit, i agree.
---
BUT
---
You see that one shoe hes got on? Its classy as fuck.
---
Counterbalance is probably the best choice then quick access sling
---
TLDR don‚Äôt read emergence. It‚Äôs about some high school girls really fuck up life and how she went from normal to homeless pregnant and a coke addict. It‚Äôs not even hentai at this point its a disgusting.
---
"They" say with Enhanced Targeting you can ADS with LW on console too...
---
im replaying the campaign in master difficulty and i forgot how juicy the platforming was, especially during !&lt;retrieving the arc with the time glove&gt;!
---
Yes, but..but I'm arc? How does this math work out D:
---
Thought I can only pick up orbs of same element I am running, guess I was wrong. Thank you for clarification!
---
Didn't getninto RDR1, but bought the second one day after launch, got halfway through and just couldn't bring myself to do the missions, because gameplay-wise they're fucking boring compared to open world shit.
---
Congrats man! You did good
---
Anything that is a bright plastic color.  Highly recommend shaders like Bumblebee and Endless Glory
---
Nice man! Proud of you.
---
Right. And they missing loot, enhancement cores.
---
Watermelon?
---
Fr I thought division 2 would kill it for me but for some reason division 2 couldn't hold my attention
---
flashbacks to the days of getting blues from legendary engrams....
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
nah you good, nothing out of the ordinary there.
---
Got it from random exotic engram from the ground
---
To get the majestic set you have to kill 100 mini bosses in EAZ, the psion counts as a mini boss, so you can get a mini boss kill every 20-30 seconds instead of doing an entire run to only get like 7.
---
I was able to finally get the rolls I wanted on my Majestic armor since they enter the loot pool for opening those boxes you get. Burned through a lot of key fragments.
---
I‚Äôd actually have to play PVP to be worried about that. PVE for me! Heh
---
That‚Äôs would look sufficiently ridiculous, so that would be a good one I think
---
I probably wont even touch destiny for 6 months after borderlands 3 comes out
---
You're the real MVP.
---
Boarderlands isn‚Äôt a games as service though. It will pull people away for a time, but probably not permanently.
---
Rip to all my ghosts for this lil boi and the glowing stuff
---
very cute, just don‚Äôt take her to the moon
---
Cursed image
---
he sold the OEM with almost this exact roll a month or so ago. I am super excited for the traction stompees though. Huckleberry is also MEH seeing as though he also sold this about a month ago? The warlock got absolutely fucked.
---
Can you get new solstice armor from the boxes? I had no idea. Got about 70 boxes amd around 1200 key fragments. Does ot enter the loot pool once you finish renewed and get the legendary set?
---
Just open another engram from Tess. Forehead
---
Wow this is so true. 
---
Destiny - one ring to rule them all
---
TOUCH√à
---
You literally said:
---
"you can't masterwork it"
---
This is false. Because he can. You would have been right had you said:
---
"You cannot fully masterwork it".
---
These sentences mean 2 different things in English. That one word changes the entire meaning of the sentence. So no, you were wrong. You would have been right, had you included the word "fully" in your comment.
---
It's kinda my point tho it's not a all purpose exotic like OEM but it's the closest thing a warlock has to liars handshake for op 1 2 punch damage.
---
It can be used to text weapons. You can refill ammo and it gas tons of enemies
---
PC (master race)
---
It's true, can confirm, it also has pump action. Hell yes.
---
Well, you do have some common ground, so guess you should always keep that note on you to kick off the dialogue.
---
They don‚Äôt call it the tangled shore for nothing.
---

Here you go :)
---
That was the plan and then the one day I forget/ decide against, it shows up again. Lol
---
I did the Riven Cheese a total of 6 times and got it... Sorry man lmao. It's super fun though, hope you like it :).
---
Not my video but a good short description of what to do. 
---
https://youtu.be/m4BdGDpBG5g
---
Somebody got a word a day calender
---
It‚Äôs a fun word stfu bitch. That‚Äôs your best comeback? Try again next time.
---
Yeah I thought it was going to be like that as well but it all depends on the burn day. I was hoping you would be able to chose what you got but its not the case, I just wanted to be in arc all the time for the speed boost haha.
---
Wait, wiped out the whole team and the opponent's primeval is still at half health and going lower??? Usually a whole team wipeout would mean it would regen all the way up to full or at least to 3/4
---
Yes
---
Your gameplay makes me want to kill myself it‚Äôs so bad...
---

Yeah I used them occasionally as well. It's kinda viable with devour (moreso with this roll). I always said winter's guile and karnstein should just be one exotic with its perk being a mix of both.
