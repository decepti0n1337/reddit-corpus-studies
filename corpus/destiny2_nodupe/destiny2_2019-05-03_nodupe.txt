Don't. Just dont

---
Yes if you’ve played 3 games this week and didn’t quit any of them
---
?
---
I played 30 comp games this week
---
I didn't know about this until now.
---
Then you’re good. You may have to play one game next week and win or lose you’ll get it.
---
This is accurate until the bonding part. Everyone knows the eldest and youngest are the closest. 
---

---
Source; dude trust me (one of 3 boys, friend is also one of 3 boys)
---
I hope not lol
---
Cuz I heard it gives u 120 points or 150
---
I was able to easily transition into bumper jumper because of my experience in Titanfall 2. Bumper Jumper for life.
---
Nice, how did you get them to level 50 besides the first one? I want to level a second/ third one but I feel like leveling is real slow
---
This meme template is the best thing to come out of the Sonic movie
---
120. A buddy of mine just did it this week. He was at 2050 last week and waited
---
Yep, Y1 D2 where shotguns used heavy ammo
---
How much did he you end up with
---
 and then do a phone screenshot, I used a picture collage maker app on my phone to put the two pictures side by side, I didn't include my Titan because he's only 687 lol I just tried to make sure and crop out any personal info, this sub only allows screenshots or official captures of you gaming system, I know because I tried to submit a pic from inside my living room last week when I completed my Iron Banner armor set and the page manager asked me not to do that lol #eyesupguardian

With crucible and gambit, when you cap out your valor/infamy at legend to can reset them and start over.  On PC you go to the map and select the activity and press and hold F.  I would imagine it's something similar on console. You start back over at Guardian and go back to getting gear every time you rank up.  There are also certain quests and triumphs that require you to set your rank a certain number of times to complete.
---
I've never used Vigilance Wing, but I've seen it fairly often.
---
Simple geometry
---
Unfortunately just had to power through them. As soon as I got them to level 50 I move my highest power level weapons over to make a journey to 700 a little easier
---
This sure brings back a lot of memories
---
[deleted]
---
Yes. I look at skyboxes a lot, especially the ones in Mercury, since it’s my favorite planet
---
Real answer: when the traveler first arrived it terraformed Mercury (along with a few other places).
---
Ah you got it.
---
It looks great
---
Sorry to trigger the try hards
---
*nice*
---
Well I didn't mean for it to come across that way. Yes, it's my opinion and 90% of the PvP playerbase seem to agree so I thought it was an apt way to put it.
---
F
---
Anything at all that boosts range is gonna be your friend, reload bonuses plus kill-clip is nasty and rampage is pretty good too. Better devils wont benefit as much from rampage as a 110 would so I’d stick with your kill clip role
---
Me too!
---
This does not spark joy.
---
Kinetic hand cannon I’ll be right back
---
Oh ok. And maybe, I mean there's no exact way to tell unless we put a poll up
---
But at this point it does majority think so
---
Boy please for the love of the traveler please 
---
That is not from endgame please
---
I believe it’s the Vigil of Saint-14 ornament
---
If you haven’t seen endgame yet it’s pretty much your own fault
---
4k gaming on console isn't native, it's just got a fancy upscaler iirc.
---
Yup, you caught me, though I did play Chrono Cross and regularly missed on 99% hit chance attacks.
---
I don’t understand
---
r/woooosh I guess
---
Thx! I have that ornament but I didn’t think it was any good lol
---
Sleeper Simulant. The primary at the beginning was either Go Figure, or Right Side of Wrong.
---
Can confirm, I have my game set to 110% render scale of my monitor and it looks crisp af.
---
The time cap is only when your prime is up. If they hit the 25 mote requirement the invasion portal reopens within a few seconds
---
whats her ig?
---
The tractor cannon aka The pocket Phalanx.
---
Its worth it. And most likely the second clan kicked you because you were offline for months
---
Heavens Vigil is a step in the right direction but this is NEXT LEVEL.
---
The reckoning armor is 1 full set in 4 different colors. On top of that, the only difference in illicit, outlawed, and notorious is the default shader. Outside of that, there's no difference. Essentially they designed 3 armor sets, then copied it 12 times per class. That's 36 pieces of identical looking armor. You can't honestly tell me that making at least the Notorious armor a little better wouldnt be worth it?
---
Paracausal farts
---
What does it do?
---
Yes. OP.
---
RIP Anthem. You tried.
---
How is it OP.
---
Dat is one angry banana
---
Explained why it is OP? Lol. Are you new to critical thinking?
---
Man, I miss the King's fall raid stuff so much. I would absolutely love to take all my friends who started with D2 and run them through those old raids one day.
---
Oh and RIP that was an impressive suicide lul
---
OP
---
Also could be stealing motes while the invader is there. Either by two+ blockers, a giant blocker, or the invader himself
---
Firmament fluff
---
So it will be patched after the event ends... Haha, nice.  At 152/200, so maybe I will make it.
---
Pretty sure both nessus shaders include yellow. You can see on some of the armor. It has been over a year, though, so I could be wrong there.
---
Christ on his cross, no!  
---
Fuck that mom
---
Connect 4
---
You can use any HC then! Kill clip is a popular roll and stacking range stats as high as they'll go as well.
---
*erra erra*
---
If you are cool with playing competitive crucible, each rank up/ sub rank up give powerful gear. That's how I got my alt. to 700, though I kind of enjoy comp.
---
It's total cancer in the Crucible and I have no regrets. 
---
Just remember "meet" rhymes with "wheat" to really annoy your friends with references to toast.
---
For real? Took me like 2 months just to get the ghost back on PS4 when forsaken released. FeelsBadMan
---
I'm pretty sure it's there for lore reasons (Sorry if I'm repeating this, I didn't read all the comments)
---
Sat there trying to do the same thing.. After 10 tries it finally went
---
I think it has a both negative and positive effect. There is almost no humor on it making it a boring and mundane atmosphere. But, in a game like Destiny, there is a lot of things to talk about compared to other games.
---
Idk what's the need for "D1 virgins" since I'm just as good at dying with my own grenades in D2 as I was in D1 but ok
---
If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please do not hesitate to talk to someone.

7 years of playing the same series? You sure you didn’t get your money’s worth?

You didn't even updoot him for updooting :(

Thank you!

Shh yes i did ;)

I need sturm, any way to get the exotic now that it's glitched

Are you serious!? Dang..  how long does it take?

For My team it takes about 45 min

I believe the boost becomes unusable when going to 30 because the boost only goes up to 30, not to 50.
---
I'm level 700 and I've attempted lev raid countless times. People get bored and get careless who have done it. Which turns into multiple wiipes. The time factor alone turns everyone off especially multiple wipes. In D1 I remember at one point doing VOG and it took 7 hours to complete.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I gave up trying to do the raid, but now that I'm maxed on level. I'll be helping my nephew with his first raid and hopefully my first raid completion.
---
He was asking many questions in his only attempt in lev and 3 people ended up leaving. I can totally understand why and can't blame them at all.
---
Oh no, EA can eat shit. They're the tumor of Gaming Industries. Anthem can get fucked. I just no longer like the current way of how games are now these days. Paying too much for too little. Did you not read that part, or are you too stupid to understand that you're being swindled to pay extra for something flashy but broken?
---
I’m paying as much as I want for the content I’m getting. I played through the entirety of D1 from launch and so did I with D2. Since the launch of forsaken I never ran out of content to play through. There was always something I could do and there still is almost a year later. If I have to pay $30 for an annual/season pass every year to get a game that will give me stuff to play for an entire year (aka $2,50 a month) sign me the fuck up
---
It's going to be more than one cut/layer. I'll cut one large piece in black, then cut out the orange and white and stick them on top. My car is a dark silver so I'm just going to leave those parts "open".
---
Ah, a man of culture I see.
---
With Antaeus Wards...
---
You know how exotic armor works... right?
---
What is the mountaintop cheese? That weapon looks awesome but after looking at the quest steps I honestly went "fuck that shit" and looked the other way. Did people find an easy way to do it?
---
&gt;Since i dont have anyone to raid with cause im shy,i ordered t
---
Bro message me lets do a raid. Are you on PC?
---
Man I used to like his videos, but I don't know why, they got annoying lately
---
Ammo count.
---
Because all he does is parrot other reviewer's opinions, and bitch about EB Games.
---
See i only play titan and warlock so i cant confirm it for hunters, but yeah, i think warlock exotics dont get nerfed because they are mainly pve, which still leaves them op
---
I main Hunter and I'm the oldest. The descriptions are too accurate though for the age groups
---
Oh, so we won’t be able to have crazy super damage for forever?
---
remember when Destiny started off weak? as well as Destiny 2?
---
it doesn't take much to find the hypocrisy in these statements.
---
This week might seem confusing with the revelry, but yeah it's a great time to join and there's plenty of activities to do and enjoy.
---
Imagine starting a stupid argument over a game
---
oh god no. I was taking a dig at the fact they announced the game was "x weeks out of Early Access" and pulling their proposed content timeline out
---
No
---
Ok, thanks.

It would have succeeded if bioware wasn’t such a mess of a dev. It had so much but sadly failed miserably.

That's what I thought it was at first because none of the other team were in the same clan. However none of my team were lagging around and being that we were all connecting from different locations, it seems a stretch that lag was only affecting the opposing team.
---
And since Bungie's split from Activision, they are left with two stores to put Destiny 3 on. Anyone wanna bet money we are going to see Destiny 3 with some kind of exclusivity deal on the Epic store?
---
Imagine if they acted like Necrons. You kill the Vex troops and they just wake up again.
---
uniroincally cannot finish TLW quest (ps4). controller aiming is way too slow and inaccurate :(
---
Sounds like user error how? Are you watching my matches? Just shut the fuck up unless you have a legit idea?
---
Or perhaps your skills are broken? Gambit Is still a new thing it took a while to get used to. A long while. But now I win almost always. A word of advice is prioritizing the right objective. If an enemy has 25 or more motes, bank your while you can do you don't lose them. If an enemy Is invading take cover. If a teammate is a good invader let them take the heavy block. Use ad clearing supers and subclasses if you're doing the reaper role of wreaking havoc. If you're in the role of the sentry which means melting. Use supers that also has debuffs or has a high damage. If you're in the role of a collector have a defensive subclass like the defender sentinel. If you're an invader use roaming supers and ranged weapons

Well, I think it depends, with the infinity gauntlet Thanos can instantly atomized all guardians, just because he said half of all beings, doesn’t mean he’s incapable of using the stones for more, but even if he was missing one stone, the odds are the guardians would win. Especially since we always aim for the head.
---
You new to gambit? Honestly it's pretty fucking common to stay on a losing streak when you're solo-queueing. And yes even for that long. You need  a few wins? Get a team/clan or become a good invader that can carry (because trust me a good invader can have an amazing effect on the outcome of a match - I'm one of those invaders)

Some Golden Gun shots automatically move Ghaul to the next phase, and since there’s those Super Recharge pools, I beat him almost immediately.

---
Ooooh!  A proper rabble-rousing!
---
Rabble, rabble rabble, rabble rabble rabble…  RABBLE!
---
There seems to be a common denominator in those 4 consecutive hours of losing in gambit, and that is YOU! Probably just need to work on some basic gun skills and good decision making and you might be just useful enough to not burden your team down to win! :)
---
Nice one dude? What gun have you gone for Lunas and recluse
---
 Nope. Do you mean heroic adventures? Gotta wait for Io flashpoint.

I main arc staff which has been under bungies radar except for arc week. Still die to random bullets when I block and all that noise. Also since I play all characters fairly often I've noticed that titan and hunter get the same amount of attention from bungo

I love that level, but i have 2 issues with it.  Firstly, I want a nightfall/difficult version.  Secondly the NAME...  1 AU is the distance from the earth to the sun (roughly 149.6 million killometers).  The Almighty is sitting somewhere within the orbit of Mercury.
---
Unless they are reffering to the distance of your roadtrip in a stolen vehicle, the name wrong.  &lt;sits in the corner and grumbles in astronomy&gt;

They announced that they have a fix for The Tower quest, but it won't be until patch 2.2.2 which has not been announced yet.

Try to get the Arbalest from doing the Revelry stuff before it goes into the loot pool next Tuesday. Then, do what the other guy said.
---
It depends on whether or not the oldest enjoys younger siblings. There are times when siblings closest in age are closer, but you can always have a situation where the oldest may have some parental instincts and the younger looks to the oldest as another guardian figure, and those two will be closer.
---
It also depends on the parents too. Parents can, unknowingly, create a rift.

Specially when peaking right on corners.

Lots of exotic quests: thorn, ace of spades, sleeper stimulant, worldline zero, the last word, whisper of the worm... even arbalest for another few days can be earned from revelry. Probably forgetting some
---
Y2 activities include blind well / shattered throne / ascendant challenges in the dreaming city, black armory forges for some crispy weapons, gambit, gambit prime and the reckoning (tier 2 or higher gives new guns), two new raids (plus two raid lairs after leviathan). Only y1 activity “worth doing” is escalation protocol from warmind.
---
Beyond that, you have pinnacle weapons for crucible (the recluse, Luna’s howl, not forgotten and mountain top), gambit (21% delirium), and strikes (loaded question and oxygen sr3), as well as a few guns you get unlocked by doing specific things for Zavala including service revolver (which will likely be very dominant in crucible next season) and nightshade. Additionally, all nightfalls have strike specific drops, many of which are well worth it like Mindbenders ambition shotgun and the militias birthright kinetic grenade launcher to name just a few.
---
If you do all that and are still looking for more, checkout the seals that can be earned in the collections tab. Pick one and go!

Good luck

Anthem had so much potential. The flying element is *fun* and including flying in the combat is *fun*. It’s just too bad the rest of the gameplay is terrible, there’s no endgame, and no story.

The reload time...

I probably should of clarified that I mean high impact sniper rifles, and high impact shotguns followed by melee. I don’t think all special weapons should one shot either, but there needs to be a reason for masterwork armour and I feel this would be one.
