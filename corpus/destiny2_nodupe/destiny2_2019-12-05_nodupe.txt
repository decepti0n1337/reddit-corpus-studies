What if there is an even where they stand next to each other and whichever one decrypts more engrams becomes the tower cryptarc (someone correct me I forgot how to spell it)
---
---
---
AND COLONEL!
---
From my experience it warlock and titan positions tend to flip flop
---
I believe this will be a new titan meta in Crucible.  Towering barricade + melee.  Time to start stacking paragon mods.

Much better.

I used Jade Rabbit for a while when momentum control fist came around, it was just to get the catalyst completed. During my grind to get the catalyst, I got the SUROS Regime catalyst. Dual speed receiver game me an advantage in mid range engagements. Got that Jade catalyst done and swapped to the regime. Got that done and went to my Duke Mk. 44 with rampage, ricochet round and rapid hit plus an Icarus Grip.

Feel your pain brother. Once you're in a gun club, it's hard to figure out time for the things you like. Stay safe out there. 🤙
---
Abewins on xb1, definitely down for about anything
---
Shaxx. Tryna bust off that other horn and use it as my personal butt plug.
---
Are you playing as a team or are you solo cause that gold Elo team looks like a premade. If you are solo you can just do freelance survival.
---
Dlc is too small for shaxx
---
He needs his own platform
---
I've run it 100+ times chasing a god roll optative.  Hunting a max range rapid hit kill clip roll.   If it wasn't for the guaranteed drop each run I probably would have just ran it 3 times and given up.  Also with all those runs I did most of the Vow quest and catalyst kill farming there.   Had the kills for the title nearly done before I ever even looked at the requirements.
---
I also need a clan on PC. What's your clan info?
---
They can't kill something already dead
---
*stuffs crayons down throat confusingly*
---
!remind me
---

---
(Not sure how to trigger the bot.)
---
Mara No question at all
---
You don't seem to understand the quote I'm going to now explain my plan to you 
---
Step1:get Cayde-6s body 
---
Step2: get the Colonel
---
Step3: let the Colonel say goodbye
---
Step4: have the colonel blow or eat up Cayde-6s ashes while I keep a small bit of the ashes
---
Step5: shoot myself with ace because a world without Cayde-6 is one I don't want to live in oh God why did he have to dieeeeeeee
---
You make entirely valid points.
---
Be fun if my title wasn’t bugged or sum shit
---
3 mediocre weapons? But I only see 1 bow.
---
Which are you favorites? I wasn't impressed, but the rolls I got all sucked I think.
---
The Russian accent is just the icing on the cake. Love it!
---
Agreed
---
As a warlock main. This could not be more true. I wanna be like saint -14 when I grow up!
---
This is the way
---
Oh man, right in the feels
---
no one gonna mention baby yoda killed him?
---
Warlocks made out the best in this game aside from the hard to use jumps. They can do both parts of the game instead of being great in one and completely outclassed in the other.
---
Gotta love how a hero carries themselves
---
Are you talking about Whisper or the actual Spindle?
---
Whisper of the worm? I get confused between the two (the io one)
---
He's been around since Deatiny 1, his exotic helm in that game was literally game changing. It gave Titans a huge purpose outside of just an armor/weapon boost bubble. 
---
Source: Titan main since D1 beta
---
Try this handheld supernova https://youtu.be/l7u3Ah9bp-Y build
---
It still bounces, unless you don't hold the trigger.
---
Lol....that Subtle Calamity is so hard to use after getting the black armory bow Spiteful Fang. Working on getting the Hush.
---
I don't think he should be brought back, but meeting him again  would be nice
---
Everyone would go to Tyra cause fuck rahool
---
Zavala was just the student. Saint-14 was the Legend.
---
This is why I get shoulder charged going through walls and two Hunter jumps above them
---
It’s true though. Bringing Cayde back would be like bringing back a dead loved one. You get to live with them for the rest of your life, but when you die, they’re still there. They continue to live forever and ever until time is no more, because they are not real. Cayde was real (in the Destiny universe at least), and bringing him back would make him a worse character for me, and I feel like it’s the same with other people too.
---
If you’re talking about the actual fight, I’m sorry, but you’re just wrong. 
---
As a boss though, yeah he’s pretty fucking badass
---
He'd let you have the first punch.
---
Gotcha. You can retry as often as you want. You’ll just need to wait for that public event again so you can kill the secret guy and spawn the anomaly.
---
One less loose end
---
I wanna drink eris's eye juices
---
I actually forgot Shiro exists
---
Yep. 
---
I thoroughly enjoyed reading about him, Kabr and Praedyth back in D1, all of their stories were fascinating to read.
---
Honestly, I just want finishers to work in PvP next season so that I can shoryuken other guardians
---
K, so Osiris and Saint 14 are old friends, go way back.
---
Saint 14 is the OG Titan Vanguard, he epitomizes the ideals of what a titan should be. One time even, while being choked out by a Fallen he headbutted it so hard the Fallens skull caved in.
---
When Osiris first entered the Infinite Forest, Saint 14 went in after him to drag him back, he got lost in the forest and ended up fighting Vex for hundreds if not thousands of years, due to the fact that time in the forest time is much much faster than in the world outside it. Eventually he died in battle with the Vex. Osiris considers this his fault, and has been seeking for a way to save Saint 14 via time manipulation ever since alongside his other goals.
---
Another part of the Season of Dawn is it continues the story of Season of the Undying. While we finished hunting down the tens of thousands of Undyingminds in the Black Garden, the Red Legion got up to some funny business. They've been after Vex Tech ever since they lost the Red War, trying to find a way to rewrite history so they won, and us killing the undying mind and occupying the Vex so thoroughly gave them the time they needed to get alot done. Now we need to deal with them before they managed to completely rewrite history in their favor.
---
If I messed anything that anyone knows about please add it into the comments.
---
P.S. go watch a video by "My Name is Byf" about Saint 14. He'll explain more in depth just who he is. What i wrote was very rudimentary.
---
Wow that's pretty dark
---
Call me nuts, but this picture looks like that Sorbet and Gelato pose, albeit vaguely
---
Petition to bring Cayde back from the dead?
---
I got the memory of Cayde bond on my warlock but you can’t put new seasonal mods on it so that suck
---
Yeah I think people don't realise that he's not coming back to life. He's simply coming this season because of time travel. We're gonna give him the perfect paradox to continue to loop, then he's gonna leave and end up dying.
---
A Sam L Jackson ghost would be amazing.
---
THE WAY ADA'S LOOKING BACK I-
---
There's no time to explain why there's No Time To Explain.
---
Will Saint 14 respect me, a warlock main, for using the perfect paradox like he would a titan?
---
It's gonna be bigger, it's gonna be better
---
Osiris, a Warlock who was banished by the Tower for "conspiring against the Speaker" because he claimed that the Vex were a serious problem that needed to be dealt with so he was banished and went to fight the Vex on his own. He went to Mercury where he discovered the Infinite Forest which is a simulation computer controlled by the Vex but he also would jump around between timelines and just disrupt as many Vex plans as possible. While he was still with the Tower he helped guide Saint 14, who is a Titan, in being a better Guardian as well as convinced Saint 14 to help fight the Vex. After Osiris was banished, Saint 14 went looking for him and eventually found the Infinite Forest as well. There he killed a ton of Vex and prevented so many Vex invasions single handed. For the events of Curse Of Osiris, we get a distress signal from Mercury because Brother Vance is there and he needs help with finding Osiris or something. We go and find Sagira, Osiris's Ghost, and take her back to Vance because she is damaged from a fight that Osiris barely gets Sagira out of by throwing her out of the Infinite Forest. We repair her using some Osiris stuff on Earth but she ends up taking over our Ghost. She tells us that Osiris needs help fighting off an invasion from Panoptes who is a giant Vex Mind that found a timeline where the Guardians fail and the Vex takeover everything in the Solar System. We use Sagira and the Infinite Forest to contact Osiris and offer our help and through a bunch of tasks of killing Vex and preventing simulation studies we find Panoptes using a map of the Forest and then we go kill Panoptes with the help of Osiris himself.
---
Yes, definitely worth it if you're at all interested in sniping in crucible.
---
DO A BARREL ROLL!! Or try a somersault.
---
How's your sister?
---
Plz give it back to us hunters 😭
---
I'm at 72, I'm probably not going to make 100, let alone 90
---
He's Greek, which honestly is significantly cooler imo
---
Heavy spartan vibes coming off saint
---
What is that rocket launcher?
---
I am not a lore master and this is a vague recount of Curse of Osiris and the minimal knowledge I have of Saint 14
---
I also know Scout Rifles and they are very balanced.
---
This is one part that I don't agree with the YouTubers about. They didn't think the overshield was a big issue.
---
My biggest problem with the item *is* the overshield. It allows Titans to 2v1 way too easily. And to just bum rush any position. 
---
Tracking is still an issue, but now I won't have to worry about a fully healed/overshielded ape flying around corners every two seconds!
---
Thank you sir, lots of grinding when I was layed up after knee surgery
---
I just need Lord Shaxx in my daily life to keep me positive and motivated. Like little alarms you can set that just play Lord Shaxx motivational quotes when they go off.
---
Go to the sticky post about season of dawn at the top of the sub.
---
Sort of expected yet another AoS model, but this is great! Love the originality
---
I’m trying to get Reckoner now and I don’t even have Dredgen yet. Literally all I need to do for Dredgen now is to win a match with only gambit weapons.
---
“They call me the greatest Titan who ever lived!”

If I had silver I’d give it for sure

Go to the moon and do all of the bounties you can grab and keep going back for the additional bounties that you can buy
---
&lt;insert type of gun&gt; + outlaw + kill clip
---
Is spamming the same shit over and over for a "god roll" fun to you?
---
Jesus christ people that only PVE are like kittens with a laser pointer on the ground.
---
I would probably have a vault like that if I didn’t dismantle duplicates and non god roles or weapons I never touched
---
This. They totally prepared the community for a tone down in content. Most of the whiners probably don’t watch all the things bungie puts out and only come here to bitch about trailers.
---
IMO, the coolest looking gun in the franchise. Really hoping it comes back as a legendary, but I’ll take a NTTE exotic quest without hesitation.
---
So twilight gap and 6 fronts dlc?
---
I thought she was only giving my warlock a lap dance.
---
You obviously haven't used them as much as I have.
---
If you are playing Momentum Control that is a mechanic in the mode. If not they could be using different exotics based on class or some weapons like Crimson.
---
I’d watch this crossover
---
Is it still available?
---
What do you mean?
---
People defending this "content" release are blind fanbois
---
Hunters assassin cowl is one
---
Congrats, most of us dont want to be rewarded the same exact set of armor that weve had for years now. I'm a pretty hardcore PvP player and this might be the first Iron Banner that I'm gonna ignore. Its shameful and embarrassing for Bungie honestly.
---
Yah thats what got me hooked to titans. And then those two never did anything cool since.
---
wow a destiny comment thread that isn’t salt  should browse here more often :)
---
I mean at leaat this copy paste meme has a different picture
---
I should probably take the time and do the same
---
Byf would like to have a word with you
---
Yes
---
shaxx will be immediately killed with this action, proceed anyway?
---
Bet you whined about Hunters not having a one shot kill
---
Braytech Osprey with Cluster Bomb!
---
I guess since that's not my playstyle I don't find myself in that situation often.. the tracking works better for me but the stat roll on mine is worse than my crucible helmet I run so it's only been used a handful of times.. if I used striker and melee kills I would probably find it useful but even then I only come across others rarely. The trick is to pop them from a distance so they don't recharge
---
Someone’s big mad that PVP the red headed step child
---
They didn't talkabout a lot of stuff, not just rituals.
---
Worth waiting for the TWAB.
---
Dafuq you on about? Go eat a banana, you are not even worth my time if you think I am excited for season of yawn
---
Shaxx is the best, but can I please get crucible legacy shader like come on man. You have to get a crucible engram, then hope what you get has the shader (the weapons always have the shader but not always the armor), then you have to dismantle it and pray to god you get lucky enough that the shader drops. 
---
Other than that Shaxx is the best.
---
He's a 'Stay-at-home' gaurdian
---
Ya really wanna fuck em'? Pretty hard cause the floating and stuff
---
Nice
---
the drifter literally says that he doesn't believe saint-14 is dead and the drifter is the smartest person in the tower... but that isn't really hard to achieve if Zavala the blue dipshit who fucks up a lot and doesn't even believe in his own idiotic speeches is actually considered to be wise... if a blue hypocritical idiotic heartless lying space elf dipshit who can't even tell the difference between a threat that's already been taken care of and a threat that needs to be taken care of... if that kind of idiot is considered wise then the bar has already been lowered tremendously
---
To be fair I'm a lucky new light bastard, so all the games inherent and old flaws aren't obvious to me yet, the gameplay loop is still fresh enough and I don't know what bingo does wrong that make people dislike them at times.
---
But even after only 5-6 weeks I can already see that the game is a blast but probably not sustainable as a daily play game for too long at the rate I play, which is fine I have a big enough backlog to get through now that I've dropped war thunder since gaijin has their head so far up their ass they're an ouroboros at this point.
---
Also I'd rather not have anyone point the flaws out, let me enjoy it for at least another month before I see the bad patterns XD
---
Thanks, at least now I know what it's called as well! Yeah, or at least give us a way to earn them again this season... I would gladly feed my gear somewhere to make them into ornaments. I also want the old wolf head warlock bond. But yeah, vault space is really needed for all the armor they want us to get, with seasonal mods and all.
---
I had a match where there was 2 sentry wannabe and (arriving late) an invader. That invader started       reeeeing at me for a try at invasion, forgeting the other two who didn't even tried to get motes. Am I wrong for doing it as a colecttor ? (I don't fully know english, sorry for wrong spelling, use of words or in-game terms)
---
i found one inside the gatehouse tucked into a corner
---
Awesome thanks!
---
I found this nice and wholesome. Reminds me of a time I was a new destiny two player,when the warming came out I was ready to get back into destiny two. Excited for it all I asked discord for help and they gave me a lot of options. Amazing people I say,still friends with them today. I found this oddly wholesome and love the community for this,thank you for sharing this image.
---
They’re better to deal with than D1 Shriekers. Those fuckers exploded and sent homing death shards at you.
---
So are the “ritual” weapons be staying?
---
Of course! I’m always kind to fellow guardians
---
I don't need sleep i need randies
---
Skull was not good in Destiny 1, it was good pre season of opulence for Destiny 2
---
She does not
---
[deleted]
---
Try playing something else than ordeal? I can't remember if ordeal counted, i did that part along with the ability/elemental kills in the aphelion's rest lost sector in the dreaming city. That lost sector boss counted for bosses defeated as well.
---
Nope
---
Hunter teleport grenade confirmed
---
The passes cost $10 a piece so at 45 (since you already have Shadowkeep) it will be cheaper just to buy the seasons individually.
---
All i see are a lot of shards and cores

Ada-1: Best Tsundere waifu in destiny

Double tap the jump button to get height.
---
This happened to me 3 times in a row just now while flying into Control. Error Code: Kale, then back to orbit. Deducing this is coming from being in my character menu or viewing others in the Roster. They need to fix this shit ASAP. Starting to prefer Stadia over console atm tbh...
---
Yes, this is a bug. There is nothing we can do, we're a bunch of random players.
---
HOW DID I FIND YOU ON ACCIDENT MAN?
---
Yeah that makes sense... it really pisses me off when i buy something then it goes on sale .. even tho its my fault cause i coulda waited lmao. Thank you ill do that
---
But don’t the campaigns not give exotics anymore?
---
This is normal, this was due to the move to steam (the October 1 update caused this).
---
Lol what’s up buddy
---
Can you do one but not when were helping a new light player? Like when were all arguing and hating each other for stupid things?
---
These are good points but if I remember correctly wasn't Saint-14 supposed to at least try convince Osiris to come back or was it just the speaker telling him Osiris was on Mercury?
---
Momentum Control is on for Randy's, Gambit Prime for Exit Strategy, Ordeals for Edgewise (I haven't checked the normal nightfalls but if there's one in a public space you can farm it). You'll have to no-life it but you can do it
---
You jave to do them all over again.
---
Seasons are free, but have a pass for lots more stuff on the progression line you can buy.
---
It's an hour or so if you're on orbit. At least a lot longer than 20 minutes.
---
People who want to create a fire team can do that no matter what though, why are you arguing against matchmaking?  But *you're* not the entitled one, right?  Just *everyone else* who doesn't play the game the same way as you that are the problem?  To use your own words, piss off.
---
You do they showed it on the Livestream yesterday
---
[i love it when casuals don’t even have the sense to do a quick google check before calling others wrong.](https://www.destinypedia.com/The_Mountaintop) maybe next time make sure you know your lore — or at least the correct spelling of characters’ names — before spewing idiocy.
---
yeah, let's call them big "fanbase" 👀
---
oh well
---
You talkin about the lock blinking?
---
But Zavala isn’t Russian and saint is.
---
wait. Now put the 4 Maras (D1 ingame cinematic, TTK intro cinematic, Forsaken cutscene cinematic, Queen's Court model)
---
You’re so much help and I’ll remember this when I decide to try on hunter full send
---
There is on pc, not on console tho.
---
Shut the fuck up bitch!
---
People’s expectations are way too high for $10. Take it for what is if you don’t like it don’t buy it I for one will enjoy what they’re throwing at us.
---
The lore essentially states that it's impossible for us to lose, because the real world is our throne world. Unless we die in the real world, we can always come back to the game, even undoing permanent death by reverting to last checkpoint.
---
Second this. The sherpas over there have an immense amount of patience. I personally have had great experiences.
---
That's what I thought but, I want to set myself up to get a good gun asap when I max out.  Wait, I think I'm actually level 20 not 12
---
https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48522
---
omg this is perfect! Thanks!!! This should be stickied in an obvious place for new players i think lol
---
Forges are on a daily rotation. Grab the HC frame from Ada-1 and get to work. Tomorrow should be Bergusia but I’m not sure
---
I recommend following the bungie and bungie help twitter pages if you have a twitter. Lots of good info posted.
---
Not shown was the warlock behind the go-pro titan that missed his mark and slowly floated away to his death.
---
What bow is that? I dont recognize the sight.
---
I did not! I am a fool. Please forgive my transgressions!
---
As of New Light, you can get the curated roll to drop from any forge. I got mine yesterday by doing a forge ignition on Volundr.
---
All you need to do is forge a legendary hand cannon frame and if RNG is on your side, you should get the curated roll to drop in a few tries.
---
Already got the Mars drop gun
---
I saw this one a while ago and i can’t help but hear it in my head whenever I launch into gambit. Gotta keep expectations low
---
Haha understandable not everyone has the time to watch em
---
shaxx on the sax?
---
960 is the cap. You cant infuse past it because you cant get ANY gear past 960.
---
960 is the current hard cap for all weapons and armor.
---
Until next week.
---
I was going to say scorn on your porn but your's makes a lot more sense lol
---
Under the right conditions, anyone can be beaten. 
---
Glory comes and goes, Guardian. If you want it, it can be yours again!
---
That belt buckle got really loud all of a sudden.
---
You're looking at the wrong seal. Those things are required for harbinger, not for undying.
---
I dig it. Keep it up
---
Do you play Destiny 2 on xbox?
---
bruh what are you smoking
---
Any thing that's you think could be improved in further installments? or a certain story that you think might be interesting to tell with him?
---
I thought that's what the Ten in the name was for.
---
Agreed, it's been a favorite for a while now. Feels good to shoot jt
---
Thanks. The curated handcannon frame looks like a beast, kill clip stacked with rampage puts up really nice numbers.
---
So..wth are obelisk?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
They better not be like the well event on the moon or something..
---
You can expand on dialogue a bit more but I get why there wasn’t too much in this particular story considering there were only 3 characters, 2 of which do not speak often. The story of Mithrax seems cool and would love to see you continue it
---
Pretty sure theyre increasing drop rate i think next week ? Dont quote me on that but i heard theyre making it as common as 1k
---
Just claim it, you can always do them again. 
---
You’ll be waiting a long time to claim it if you want to get to 950 first
---
Besides obvious reasons what!?
---
Oh... I was under the impression you could push past it with continuous pinnacle gear drops. I guess that was my mistake.
---
I’ve seen guardians above 960 but I guess that’s due to the power level boost you get.
---
This piss me off because I tried running a nightfall 3 times in a row and all three times all I saw was
---
JOINING ALLIES 
---
5
---
4
---
3
---
2
---
1
---
What's up?
---
Yea, anything past 960 is due to the seasonal artifact.
---
Don't have any of the dlc unfortunately, depending on how much i get sucked back into it I may just have to cave for them
---
can’t believe i forgot that one, there you go!
---
All you did was add 10 words using paint
---
Lol. The complainers. Constantly bitch about the game and that they are going to leave... then log in the very next day
---
I believe you could still access the free lite content, youd have to google it tho, cause I don't recall what it is at this point (sorry) 
---
Shadowkeep is a pretty good story line, and allows access to other content on the moon, like the Pit of Heresy dungeon, and the raid (if you're joining a clan) the pit is a 3 person fireteam, and you'd need to group up prior to joining, it isn't matchmaking. But use the destiny app to find groups.
---
I mean Shadowkeep was about the size of Opulence so its understandable
---
They want the ones who would pay $20 or more for the content AND pay $15 or more for the ornaments. These are not “micro” transactions anymore, but we still keep paying the entry fee so. If everybody just stopped paying for them, they would stop immediately.
---
Fucking being a warlock sucks in any jumping puzzle. You activate too early or late you’re dead. You fall off a platform rather than jump you’re dead. You thought you could recover? Nope you’re dead.
---
For legal reasons, I can’t answer that.
---
And I am warlock. I can breathe underwater because whoever designing my armor is stupid.
---
Never got thorn either. I just finished the quest, but it sucks trying to find a third to do the strike
---
Did anyone bother to ask what "renewed pvp focus" even means before speculating ?
---
YAAAAASSSSSSSS!!!
---
Literally one of the most used loadout in high level pvp is last word and a sniper
---
That’s cute
---
Does it have one of those enhanced strikes?
---
It's nice that they ended their names with their penis length.  In centimetres.
---
Fundamentally, I agree with you; having a balanced pvp in a looter shooter is impossible
---
However, there's just something about everything bungie makes that's just *SO* addicting, that I can't put the pvp down 😭
---
Is this from the trailer? Don't remember getting such a good look at the armor :o
---
First time ever, we did the cheese and it dropped for me and another guy that was also doing it for the first time. Salt was bountiful.
---
Yeah, it’s a lot harder version of Savathuun’s Song. With the giant shrieker
---
I got the progress but there's still only four of the five
---
I couldn't. At the time my harddrive was busted so I missed it.
---
Not that I’ve seen on console
---
I can see that being an issue XD especially the second void orb thing getting obliterated by two shriekers let alone the boss room I’d probably do it with my nightstalker hunter and try to stay invisible as much as I can.
---
It’s such a fun weapon to use
---
it was friendly... lol. I guess it happens when enemies are supposed to despawn
---
Not a recent meme but I wanna see a 3 player Pillar men emote
---
The puzzles will stay active in that raid run until it closes. If you leave and start again from the checkpoint it won’t count.
---
why not both
---
Don’t run the matchmade 920.... get a couple people in a party and run the 950 or 980. Fuck randoms.
---
Noone is expecting them to mainly focus on PvP. NOONE. It's the fact that any changes to PvP are gonna stick for at least 3 months. It's the fact that PvP isn't even an afterthought it's the 4th/5th/6th item in bungie's order of importance. Just shy of half the concurrent players are in the crucible everyday so why does it receive minimal changes over extemely long periods of time? 
---
We're not asking for bungie to ditch PvE for PvP but we just want changes at a reasonably consistent rate. Besides, trials would be a complete mess in the crucibles current state.
---
Ada-1 best waifu
---
Just started playing again now since my brother can play with the lute version. Now gotta wait for him to get this next season pasd
---
BANK THOSE MOTES, BROTHER.
---
For real banking is important and the aim of the game. Aim for banking 10 or 15 rather than 5 and don't just snag one more if your on zero and someone is on 14. I tend to only bank for a small because its weak on it's own burnt can make other blockers harder to kill. And if your going to invade bank first.
---
the headbutt finisher. straight from the lore lol
---
Nice man.  Just joined up on PS4 and joined the discord server.
---
No one needs to talk to ada
---
That or a photo room mode, where you can customize it for photo videos and phots
---
Your content, huh? So you made that game?
---
Nice man!
---
Well if you are looking for a clan we’re open!
---
Join us!
---
For sure!
---
I love tittles
---
I'm 60% on Multikill for the Mountaintop quest. Need to complete it before the season Glory reset reeeee
---
I just get chad type Titan vibes
---
That's OK I have one with a good roll so that's great.
---
Damn its sexy af, jelly
---
what sense does it make to go in without Anti Barrier and Unstoppable if this required?
---
There’s one that makes it look even better which I want
---
100% great advice!
---
Well, you can go into a restaurant, expect a great meal and get a very mediocre one and still enjoy the evening. But how many times more will you visit that restaurant, if it constantly serves shitty meals?     
---
No raids, no PVP changes, it feels like they are not even trying any more.
---
I have a imperative with explosive rounds and eye of the storm. Is that any good
---
Thanks
---
Thank you
---
Unfortunately no
---
Had a feeling jade rabbit would be suggested I will give it a go.
---
"This time with even LESS content and even LESS story!"
---
well this is really disappointing
---
AoS, spare rations, blast furnace, sacred provenance, bygones
---
Holy shit I *knew* this looked vaguely familiar and I *just* finished Golden Wind
---
I have OEM but refuse to use it out of respect for the enemies.
---
Aww man.
---
I did all of Randy’s but the comp because I heard I could finish it later even if the season ends
---
I’ll do stuff like that if they use it too that’s usually my self kept rule for myself I don’t use broken stuff or tbag unless they do
---
Both parties are bad. Its okay to criticise a product. But some of you get ridiculous expectations and then whinge they weren't met
---
Why is everyone saying the live stream is tearing the community apart?
---
We gonna have a Rob Gronkowski Spike EMOTEEE
---
Cheers dude!
---
No but seriously he’s a ln exo does he have pp?
---
Thats everything tho. I bet thats the only new armour set and only two exotics
---
Delve deeper ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Tlw beloved is literally the most broken loadout in the game, but what do i know
---
What my cat sees at 3 am when I go to pet him

How do you get the catalyst?
---
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
---
Matchmaking makes us lazy and antisocial. Just do a LFG  saying no Mic be "hard mode". Bungie has 90% of the content match made. There has to be some content with an entry barrier otherwise we will have only seasonal charity titles like undying.
---
TLW wasn't ever as good on console as it was on pc, due to fov and lack of control you have with mouse and keyboard.
---
No I'm not making this up I have about 80 strength, synthoceps, and bottom tree striker. Once I kill one guy either with a gun or melee I one shot punch anybody after and I do not have thundercoils on.
---
Development cost for a new environment isn't worth it without being a mainstay. Like how we get new environments whenever there's actually a big in-game event or change
---
Or you know, pull a DE and develop random shiz and throw it to the rabid content starved playerbase to consume and get bored of in under 10 days...
---
Man it sucks when one game is just too long to play for fun and the other is too short to sustain your desires...
---
Obtain it or complete it? I dont even remember how i got the catalyst but completing it requires precision headshots... lots of it.
---
Yeah I know what you mean. Guess if I think about it now my concern is more replayability then actual content. I rather have TTK, ROI and Forsaken like dlc's and have some droughts then these seasons.. With those I would play any day of the week of the season and not get bored. Now it's just come online Tuesday and Wednesday and wait for reset again basicly..
---
You act like I haven’t used handheld supernova before. Maybe it just comes easy to me, but honestly I don’t really see how it could be hard.
---
So what would make a hard reset necessary?
---
I personally like night watch or Randy’s 
---
You get night watch from gambit and it’s like mida but legendary. It still gets out flinched by mida sometimes but if you hit the first head shot you should win the fight
---
I used night watch to get Randy’s and it is a grind but once you get the scout rifle kills done (450) and the glory (2100) the rest comes naturally.  It’s not like broadsword that has a long quest that you have to grind for but the main problem is it leaves people with one health. It is a 260 rpm scout that is auto fire but it feels really bad at longer ranges because all that the gun has is a red dot.
---
This is why I fucking love shaxx
---
Are you talking about the nightfall? If so, now is a good time to do it, people are farming it for golf balls this week.
---
Ooh oke, we cool again my guy 😁
---
He'll be either "ohh, more punching to do" or "angry russian noises and mixed cursing"
---
Someone who knows how the industry works? *ghasp*
---
There's a lot of shit here so I'll try to condense my reply:
---
1. "Boycotting" crucible (or any other gamemode) because you don't like the state it's in is stupid and wholly ineffective. People (myself included) will continue to play crucible because despite its flaws, it can still be fun. Of course this is not to say there's no room for improvement. 
---
2. As for complaining about sweaty players: get good. Trials is supposed to be hard; that's the whole point. Just because your own inadequacy prevented you from having fun doesn't mean tons of other people didn't have a blast. 
---
3. Nowhere in my comment did I even mention "hype", "letdown", or any similar buzzwords, so I'm not sure what your point is here. I didn't think I would have to say this, but asking for an occasional update on the state of a particular gamemode is not the same thing as getting every detail about every decision. This dismissiveness normalizes Bungie's behavior in this regard, and it's a real problem. The lack of dialogue between playerbase and developer is *not normal*, and it hurts the game. 
---
4. My concern is not "one gamemode above all the else", as you put it. I enjoy crucible more than other modes, and it pains me to see it be neglected for months on end. I recognize the need for varying content across different gamemodes. But this shit has got to stop. I made my case: the crucible is a wasteland. There is no reason to play it. Adding a fun, generally liked gamemode would be good for the playlist as a whole. This is the argument I made from the beginning, and I would argue I went about it in a "constructive way", as you say. I respectfully clarified why I didn't want identify with the post, I explained why trials was important at this time,
---
No, but it's fun. 
---
More importantly, I'm referring to the size. Was it annoying to not be able to use sparrows? yes. But it's a small area.
---
So I had this happen quite a bit on my climb. I would match with the same team against the same opposing team. Solution? After a losing match, hold off for a couple minutes. Go get a drink, walk around, check out Reddit or YouTube, whatever just don't immediately go back in. Those folks are just reloading into matches immediately so they'll get matched with other people. Hell, towards the end I did this even when I was on a winning streak. It works really well and honestly kept me from getting tilted to easily and losing my cool, which is something that is essential to comp.
---
Mountaintop? I've found I got messed up from mountaintop, and even shotguns, because I'm in ADS too much. Not saying that that's the case with you, but it was for me. My point with this is, look at how they killed you and count that as a mistake and try to correct it for future gameplay. No weapon by itself is inherently OP, IMO, and because of this there is always a work around to a loadout.
---
Last piece of advice, try to make sure to make team plays. Hard in solo, I know, but try. Opposing teams go down quicker if you work together.
---
Good luck out there! I hope you make it to 5500!
---
“B-But if they don’t come out with new content I might catch my reflection somewhere and have to think about my life!!”
---
Not in the beginning. Not until you for to the City to get one
---
huh. that explanation actually makes a lot of sense. at first i didn’t see why people would want him to be vanguard but it would actually be a pretty good idea. thanks
---
It's the Ginyu Force.
---
Tbh, I don't mind the upcoming season, just wish they'd ramp down the grind to a level where it's not half impossible to get to the end of the ranks without deadicating all your free time...
---
I know it's whining about "too much content" but honestly I don't like paying for something and then realizing, oh shit I didn't get all the stuff.
---
Besides that, hyyyyyyped about saint 14 and actually getting somewhere with the story that's got me by the balls
---
The first time I went in I had no clue what was going on, I just saw a portal and hopped in.
---
I didn't even get a fourth of the way, mainly because I got confused in a spot about where to even go (around the corner, flying). But I was going very slow, thinking "meh I'll make it, there's a lot of time left on the timer"... doh. :)
---
“And what is something about you?” 
---
“Goblins”
---
Ok so I just googled synthoceps and it says being surrounded buffs damage so I'm assuming even just being around one character buffs the damage enough to get the kill.
---
I think you have to get the badge before it ends, not completely sure though.
---
Haha I know right! Let them play with their re-reskinned weapons!
---
Why are people downvoting, pvp is extremely horrible right now despite bungie saying they would “fix it”!!!
---
are there multiple use ones?
---
Remind me, what make those cloaks so popular?
---
Small rundown of destiny content, which is basically divided in years.
---
Year 1 : The base game + 2 DLCs -&gt; this is now completely free 
---
Year 2: Forsaken Expansion + 3 DLCs (called the annual pass) -&gt; this is all bundled in Forsaken now
---
Year 3: Shadowkeep expansion + future Season passes -&gt; if you buy the normal Shadowkeep you will get the current season with it (the new season starts next week so it's worth to wait for that) , there is also the 'deluxe' version of Shadowkeep, which contains all future season passes for this year (until fall 2020). 
---
Year 4 will start in fall 2020, probably with a new expansion and new seasons - but nothing confirmed yet.
---
Got Bane of Tyrants, and by extension, achieved Harbinger.
---
OHK IN momentum Control my dude ;)
---
That’s just the kind of game destiny is. It’s known for its long grind
---
No you do not have to buy it, just like you stated with last year it is not neccesary to keep playing, they arent locking you out of pvp or old raids, just not giving you stuff for free that probs cost millions to make.
---
YEEESSS
---
I’m using exit strategy, bad juju, crimson
---
That’s pretty much everyone’s first couple months, run, gun, and punch. Then you get into the endgame grind and the addiction starts to form.
---
I don’t either, I just see a man of culture
---
Skadoosh?
---
Uldren wasn't a hunter when he shot Cayde. Plus, Cayde did not make a vanguard dare with Uldren. Therefore, he is not a hunter vanguard by right.
---
To each their own then. HHSN and shoulder charge are both pretty cheesy though. Each has it's own advantages and disadvantages, one isn't really more or less cheesy than the other, it just depends on your playstyle and how you use it
---
And Zavala is an awoken, still doesn't make sense
---
No? Alright, I’ll have to use it more then. But I feel like the ace of spades isn’t that good either, am I wrong on that too?
---
I still need the collections, (including a master NF) and some Vex Offensive stuff.
---
Go steal from devrim he got one
---
Yeah, it's the very last thing I need for the title.. and I absolutely hate Destiny 2s PVP :(
---
This! Shaxx approves.
---
Is it the size of a bullet though? Or is the black hole roughly a proton sized payload (just like modern bullets are only part gunpowder) and the rest is the bullet mechanism to make it a viable weapon?
---
Desperate to be the centre of attention.
---
D1 Y2 iron banner was my favorite set of armor
---
wait till the 10th, if you buy it now the season pass you get is for season of the undying which ends in less than a week and you'll have to buy dawn separately
---
Its not stealing its collecting debt mofo still hasnt made us tea
---
No you didn't.
---
Mountain top actually takes skill
---
I think it was my second or third . Maybe the first exotic weapon I got though, not counting cold heart and sweet business.
---
Unfortunately
---
Byf is a fake he fakes his voice and didnt represent the community at the warmind comunity summit, fuck byf
---
Yeah, I’d like wait until at least the next season, especially if you already have Forsaken. Maybe even until Christmas in case they have a sale
---
Getting an exotic during the trickster mission is the most confusing thing I can think of
---
Totally not biased at all
---
It used to shoot three bullets and still shoots two if I recall correctly.
---
That kinda flashy nonsense is what gets guardians killed permanently. Just sayin'.
---
They look cool
---
I just started as a new light player a long while ago in November when Season of Undying still had a long way to go. In that time frame, I got up to power level 931 (+6 bonus level of course..), get 10 exotics including Sturm, Whisper of the Worm, Outbreak Perfected and the MIDA Multi-tool and just overall started loving the game.
---
I honestly don't want Trials to return. 2 flawless runs were enough for me...  
---
That shit was actually scary.
---
The less mass a black hole has, the faster it evaporates. How we are shooting them is beyond me. Afaik
---
You get season of dawn so its okay
---
Absolute best lore description: insurmountable skullfort.
---
I read it regularly and use it the most.  Makes me laugh EVERY time.
---
Have you used it since it was buffed? It did totally suck before.
---
I need anomaly ASAP
---
Because it’s a year 1 exotic and literally no one even liked it back then, so it was shelved except for a few ‘enlightened’ people who love this gun. We’re not streaming because we are saving the streamers asses by clearing out all the thralls so they get their “Big Time Kill”.
---
Also Riskrunner. Suddenly got love because the Recluse got nerfed.
---
Is it good nowadays? Used to be my favorite exotic, back on launch days, in the brief period I had a PS4... with Izanagi and some other powerhouse weapons now, I didn’t even remember this existed.
---
Indeed
---
Not everyone's tho. Our ghost is an annoying piece of shit.
---
Yeah r/DestinyTheGame can be really toxic and have the worst expectations that make no sense and then when they don’t get them they get super upset for no reason
---
nice
---
Do you think you are the only one? The game has thousands of players.
---
I agree 100%
---
I'm not a fan of pvp either, but I can tell that theres just going to be more sweats in the new modes.
---
I'm a 14 year old kid.  I hope later in my life I'll still be able to game like you.  Good stuff, may RNGesus be ever at your side.
---
Man it broke my heart when it came out and suddenly I found myself having a working life...
---
Spikey shell.. like the Sagira shell!
---
Now I imagine byf running through the tower with a bunch of scrolls under his arm.
---
house of meyrin
---
Ima keep it real wit you chief.
---
I actually liked PVP better when this bad boy was the "Meta" weapon everyone was using.
---
HEY, LISTEN!
---
Listen up good people of the city
---
Perhaps both. I'm just so hyped for next week
---
*Gather up motes and summon that primeval, brother!*
---
Randy's took me so long
---
When constantly bitching is a free farm of gold and silver, why stop?
---
Yeah I feel that. Someone below had a really good comment about trials of the nine returning: people look back on it with such rose colored glasses, but it was terribly toxic. Players DDoSing for wins, etc. There are people who say trials returning would save or change the game, but it would bring its on slew of problems - which people would then complain over.
---
Osiris is lame
---
Fair point, but we shouldn't assume things. The date is only stated once directly in the post, while links leading to other websites/pages also state the date. Maybe they simply missed the date and in their enthusiasm wrote this comment? We're all human and do mistakes, no need to be harsh about it.  ^ - ^ 
---
Nonetheless, this post is a wealth of well structured information and we should thank /u/WistfulAether for their hard work! Thank you! 😄
---
Its a F2P game now and literally all of eververse is cosmetics now that the armor is ornaments. There is nothing wrong with it, the money they get from it funds free events and missions like Whisper and zero Hour.
---
Never
---
!remindme 8 hours
---
I do have whisper and izanagi.
---
But prefer the look / sound of tranquility
---
It's good but it's no trinity gual which is crazy
---
If you just want to enjoy the game, I’d suggest not posting memes and just playing the game.
---
Forgot this exotic even existed
---
I get the feeling he won’t be around for the next season
---
The Eliksni never had the light in the same way Guardians do; creating the ghosts and thus guardians was sort of a hail mary on the Traveler's part when it couldn't flee from the encroaching darkness anymore.
---
I mean I'd still like to see mithrax tear it up though
---
I use whisper with tranquility and I completely agree w how it looks. Firing line just gets you that big buff when you stand close to two other buddies
---
I mean shit I love this game but like many things it reeks of wasted potential in spots and that hurts exceptionally more when you know what beautiful things the makers are capable of. 
---
The bitching is a testament to its quality in a way.
---
if it was mmo they wudnt make destiny 3
---
instead they wud be keep adding expensions to destiny 2
---
Byf never let Saint-14 die. Just sayin’
---
[I want this one back](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3b/7f/f1/3b7ff1ec49dae259dd201509be6844aa.jpg)...
---
Exactly! I've stopped caring about what's "bad" and have been making do with what they give us-and I haven't been disappointed yet; i highly doubt I ever will be.
---
Destiny 3 won’t be coming out till like 2021 lol
---
It’s bungie, they’re gonna milk the game as much as they can before people stop wanting to play it.
---
It involves going out of bounds, and the games after going far enough the game brings you back way up in the sky. Yesterday there was a video of ya Titan doing it, there are a bunch of videos of people doing it if you need reference.
---
Hell yeah always good to see someone not giving up on the PvP scene just because they arent the best. It's important to keep at it because that's how you'll improve. 
---
Keep grinding for pinnacles or, hell just go for mountaintop and recluse lol. I've got about 1500 PvP kills average on both lemme tell ya that shit is both fun and very forgiving. 
---
Also I cant stress how important mods are. Make sure you're using mods that compliment the guns youre using otherwise youre just putting yourself at a flat disadvantage.
---
Do you people forget BYF made up fake lore on his site... yeah he’s definitely Toland
---
Ulan Tan is the warlock to honor.
---
It'd not so bad, aside from the fucking pauldrons lmfao.
---
Don`t worry. You will have time to play, just not so much.   
---
But there are other great perks when you level up in RL, like respect, some money, and earned love (Plz don`t kill me ig)
---
Oh man, I remember that meme format..good times. Wish I could see more of that
---
Ha figures, guess I just suck
---
Better idea: Guardian vibe check, you hold a club over your head and bonk their head in with it in two count 'em TWO frames total.
---
More focused =/= only suited for
---
Great thanks I think mine has rampage and the one that involves sliding for better accuracy.
---
This is the way.
---
What makes you think he fakes his voice? I doubt someone fakes their voice for 2 hours
---
You would've thought with Cayde gone it'd go up but no...
---
I don’t get some people
---
They have expectations of where a good game will go.
---
They take a random guess that an update will happen, despite the devs not ever bringing it up.
---
When it doesn’t happen, they get mad at the devs for “going back on their word”.
---
What.
---
I think insurmountable skullfort has the best.
---
BRAINVAULT Sigma-ACTIUM-IX Cranial Dreadnought (Invincible Type)
---
Hello. We understand you require Real-Time Combat Instructives.
---
This is a BRAINVAULT Sigma-ACTIUM-X Cranial Dreadnought (Invictus Type). It is a fortress for your skull. Your skull is now a mighty bastion. You can break anything with your skull. The only limit is your spine. Relax. The lights will speak for you. Your hands are your eyes now. Look around. You find hand-to-hand combat relaxing. The lights will attract the enemy. Help them to relax as well. You will feel the effect of a CAREGRAVER Gamma-LYSANDER-IV Health Enforcer (Frontline Variant). Your enemies do not have a skull fortress. Their skulls are like meadows. Play in the meadows. Gather the flowers from the meadows. Gather them with electrokinetic trauma. Smell the flowers. Isn't that nice?
---
You are safe in your skullfort.
---
I'm going to try and get that perk on tranquility.
---
One last question -  can you get a curated tranquility to drop or is it for certain weapons only  ?
---
Lol, yeah well worth the money :)
---
That's... unbelievably cursed.
---
Take my updoot you filthy animal.
---
Honestly, all I've done this season was grinding my ass off for the *Undying* seal. And getting 960 on each piece of gear of course.
---
"Guardian to the left of you. Guardian to the right of you. Guardian in FRONT of you. VOLLEYED AND THUNDERED!"
---
That would boost my in game skills.
---
I didn’t say the focus was correct, just that they are indeed trying to adjust PvP.
---
Wtf! I had the same idea. Haha I have another idea where you use the "Hold on" emote then your ship crashes  into the enemy.
---
don’t expect a legendary every crucible match. if you want some good stuff then don’t play pvp all the time
---
"FIGHT FOREVER, GUARDIAN!"
---
Played us like a damn fiddle
---
Tell me all the pve oriented games that last 5 years. There are basically none, pvp extends a games life more than new strikes ever could. Trials probably was the only reason Activision funded d2. Pvp doesn't have to be number one but it sure as hell shouldn't be an afterthought.
---
It’s all fun and games until a titan obliterates his ghost and gets mauled by thrall.
---
I did it just fine it's just a really long quest
---
Y’all should try mexican shaxx. He is just as enthusiastic but twice as ethnic.
---
That's actually my LEAST favorite IB armor from past seasons.
---
Nah thats ghost abuse
---
Shot, beat me to it
---
it was always a grind. what d1 were you playing where you wouldn’t endlessly be grinding for a god rolled eyasluna or devils dawn?
---
Gotta love bungie!
---
There is no servers btw only p2p
---
Nah, the don't give a flying fuck about the people doing the work, their empathy and humanity stops at  where their inconvenience starts.
---
Its honestly not a bad weapon, but it felt greaaaaaaaaaat when I finally claimed it.
---
If you can land headshots consistenly, it will shred most players after landing its perk
---
The helmet stays on
---
"Oh no"
---
"Oh yes"
---
Those words are always combined with something great.
---
I fully blame my campus then, hahahaha
---
No. But it's satisfying when you finally get it.
---
This is fantastic. Too bad bungie would never 😪
---
Please teach me in the way of Mexican Shaxx.
---
Hmm... This has not been my experience.  I play on PS4 and i finally grinded to 5500 this season. I'm sure i saw a match or 2 where something didnt add up, but i dont think it is very prevalent all around.
---
A Godroll redrix is still top tier.  
---
It's just that you have to through all that trouble just to get it into the ppol, then you STILL have to grind for the godroll, and even after you get it you STILL have to feed it sparklies to masterwork it...
---
Do you play on xbox?
---
Cause I can assure you these people who go whole tickets in trials or comp to 2100 with 3/4 or now 2/3 of the enemy team just conveniently disconnecting are either dossing host booting or packet poisoning. I just used the term ddos because it's more well known.
---
Lagswitching is very practical, and while I won't disagree that bungies netcode can cause a similar issue without player intention it is like you said a p2p game and exploits are plenty. 
---
And I assure you while the tickrate or the networking is abysmal enough to make it seem like theres higher fire rates going on that doesnt explain a consistency in the users expanded fire rate.
---
Ghost reload cheats on external APIs are standard with most script packages.
---
From a story stand point no they shouldn't but making a story that force you to level up isn't either. On the other hand from a gameplay standpoint starting in 750 with access to most content makes it more fun for new players if they want to play with a friend
---
Honestly, I don't think fastleveling is the way to go with destiny...
---
I would suggest just so the stories, get acquainted with how the game works, and you'll be lvling up nicely...
---
That said.. want fast level?
---
Get a ghost with guiding light. 
---
Get bounties ..
---
I’m a Destiny 1 Year 1 veteran, Coming back after New Light came out, I got back in the groove and managed to get The Recluse after going through hundreds of Comp Matches and losing. I’ve never felt so empowered to get a weapon before
---
Imagine just blindly believing that everyone who disagrees with you is a spoiled child. Oof
---
If i want pinnacle weapons does it start over or do i have to do them this season? I went and got recluse last night and that was no problem since I'm decent at PvP but the others all have requirements idk if I can get yet, like a million grenade launcher kills lol. If it's just the rank that resets though that's the easiest part i think.
---
Also good point on shaders! I'll double check those since I finally hit 960 and my main gear is pretty set
---
*HOLY SHITTTTTTTT*
---
What’s the god roll? I spend 300+ tokens yesterday and didn’t get one to drop at all.
---
Lies
---
Had a guy messaging team chat saying we're all useless and condescendingly saying we can click the left mouse button to fire our guns
---
He was 3rd from the bottom of the team at the end of the match with like a 1.1 ka/d
---
I wish you the best of luck.
---
This season has been a lot better , but previously the difference between 2100 and 3-4000 was night and day, it went from good players/ concentrated loadouts .
---
To just absurd stuff happening nearly every match.
---
I've been playing at 5k for the last few days and while theres not been anything too glaringly obvious theres been enough suspicious stuff that I thought I'd bring the discussion up as I'm tired of the access xbox and devs allow external API cheats.
---
I also wouldn't doubt ps4 has less cheating
---
I can’t beat the milk out of you without walking closer
---
Idk, I like doing stuff on the side to lvl up sufficiently. I also like having to work for a cool armor set. Makes you feel like you've earned it.
---
Why people are mad: Bungie SAID there was going to be a lot of focus on PvP.
---
Trials of Osiris would make perfect sense this season.
---
Trials has been on hiatus for over a year now, after the lie that it would be removed for work but would return soon.
---
Nah b he chillin in Iron Temple or doing Scout bidness......
---
He is arguably the single most important person for destiny as a game, and as a community, that isn’t on bungie’s payroll.
---
was a daily pvp player and really enjoyed it, grinded this two weeks before shadow keep and have zero motivation to touch crucible since
---
He needs to believe he is a grow up man lol
---
Didi, Ghost of Marcus Ren, recites a 4.5 act play from memory until any enemies and the Ghost of Tyra Karn kill themselves in anguish.
---
So on mercury talk to the president of Osiris’s fan club to get a fancy prophecy in a box, complete four of the prophecies and you get part one of the quest.
---
It foreshadowing links betrayal of Hyrule.
---
It’s a mmo. There will always be a disappointed section of the fanbase in new content. There are a lot of cynics in this world.
---
THIS🙌
---
That's because the Drifter is a paranoid psycho.
---
then don’t expect to get exotics every match.
---
I'm absolutely with you on the one shot thing, but i think it should be a skill based one shot like a sniper head shot. Getting clapped with a shotgun close range is fine if the player makes the play, but there are so many bads who run around with a 3 KDA in the game because they run jotuns with a shotgun. Erentil is another one thats just point in direction and click. Honestly if they removed the 1 shots like that it could potentially fix a lot of issues and become a lot more skill based.
---
that’s the joke
---
Because he didn't abandon his position to fight an ennemy with virtually endless ressources nor did he recklessly rushed into an ambush during a mutiny.
---
MIDA multi-tool, great scout
---
I got monte carlo in front of my friend and he started to bitch and moan about how he "never gets any exotic" and 20 minutes later he got monte carlo.
---
She is the vex
---
The most Titan lore tab EVER. *Cue Shaxx: "I LOVE IT!"
---
Yeah
---
What season was this?
---
Man I hope more people would think like you. With the speaker gone, he's the head of the city, that responsability alone makes it so that he has to put his titan temper aside in favor of more "diplomatic" ways of doing things. I'm sure he was a badass before being appointed as the titan vanguard and the vanguard commander. And I'm sure that when the time comes, as you said, he'll blow everyone's socks away. 
---
I feel that the main reason for people who hate on him is based on the Red War and Forsaken campaings. In the Red War he was lightless, but he still was the vanguard commander, so he couldn't go around kicking cabal, he had to coordinate the now scattered FOTC(Forces Of The City) and plan an invasion into the city to retake it and the traveler. 
---
And in the Forsaken campaing, you can clearly see in his face the rage he had while Ikora was talking on Cayde's funeral, but he had to think of his possition as the new leader of the city first instead of leaving to take on Uldren and his barons. And when our guardian spoke and said that we're going for Uldren's head, you can see the relief in his face, relief to see that we'll make sure Uldren will pay. He had to maintain the city leader's façade for everyone's sake, and I think that's the reason on why he scolded us when we visit the tower after killing Uldren.
---
When he has to get things done by his own hands, we can see how he tosses all other things around and goes for it, like in the Warmind campaing, he didn't doubt without a second on going to stop us from waking Rasputin, whom Zavala sees as a very dangerous threat because of the siva outbreak that killed almost all he Iron Lords. He saw rasputin as a threat to the city, the traveler and humanity, and he went into the "battlefield" without a second thought.
---
Sure, Saint is a legend and is regarded as the best titan ever and Zavala isn't such things, or at least not to that level. But we don't have to forget that even Saint respects Zavala, as even before his death, Zavala was the titan vanguard and vanguard commander for a long time. He wouldn't have stepped down from being those things if his succesor wasn't well regarded and capable, both in combat and leadership.
---
He and Myelin are great lore guys, and Byf does do a lot for charities.
---
If his eyes were a little wider, he'd look just like my boyfriend... Wtf...
---
In short, this is going to hurt. A lot.
---
This is the roll that I used before I started using Bite of the Fox, it's a very good roll that i found very reliable.
---
If you don't care about how you look go play fucking borderlands then
---
To my knowledge there are no differing element mods, so you’ll need void exotics.
---
I always see posts like these but it’s funny when it’s an actually problem ruining the game, like eververse
---
He never gave his Ghost a chance.  In the "Man with no name" lore book, his very first action as a Risen was to listen to his Ghost's recommendation, then deliberately go the other way.  Even though it let to him starving to death and being resurrected still starving multiple times (side note: this is where that "Drifter's hungry!" catchphrase comes from).  His Ghost could also have fixed the hunger, but Drifter didn't trust that either.  (Of note: his Ghost had speaking lines at that stage in his life, and doesn't now.  Suspicious, albeit not incriminating)
---
Because he gets beaten by a single cabal
---
There was a scorn on Cayde's horn
---
Yeah, why is iron banner armor so shit now. Looks so plain
---
Just played a game where literally every player, including me, was using Riskrunner. It was great, because we were all triggering one another’s Arc Conductors and it was just nonstop Riskrunner fire.
---
&gt;Has pretty much made the wrong call everytime, even when it seems like the most sensible option, as if the dude is stuck in a kafka-esque nightmare
---
Reddit: God damn, this dude does nothing right.
---
Zavala's not terrible, but listening to him would probably get most, if not all guardians killed. Not to mention, he sent like, four fireteams to die in that Savathun's Song strike before we came along. Guy literally used the Zaff Brannigan Killbot strategy: "I realized that Killbots all had a kill limit, so I sent in wave after wave of my own men to tire them out."
---
I'm gonna have to say that I agree. ONLY because they made it free to play.
---
What? WHAT!?
---
#WHAT?!?
---
What emote is that?
---
Don't worry, I think most people recognize that other guy as a semi-literate moron.  
---
I also agree with you, I want matchmaking expanded for most activities, for pretty much exactly the same reasons, letting me choose to use my time or not to do the activity and potentially meet more players to group with in the future.
---
The only thing they said was trials of THE NINE  wasn't coming back
---
Ah I see, its nice to hear some constructive and informative criticism for a change
---
Are you kidding me?! How the hell am I supposed to just get void versions of those? I'm not one to whine a whole lot, but that really makes no sense. I'm kinda infuriated.
---
As if he never starved, gg.
---
Nothing better than talking shit to good friends
---
That would be awesome... I'd love to build my own god roll.  Plus, I've missed the weapon leveling/unlocking from D1 a lot, and I think this would scratch that itch.  I might even break my longstanding policy of not paying for eververse stuff if they used it for this.
---
Wtf
---
Nah Toland doesn't need to alter his voice to sound "better" which actually results in sounding unnatural. I enjoy Byf's lore talk but cannot bear his voice for too long since it's so obviously fronted.
---
"Only Vex matter..."
---
Why did this get downvoted? Leave the poor guy alone.
---
Yes, they added a new opening mission that's a redux of the OG D1 starting mission. After you finish it, you can go to the tower and start the campaigns by talking to Amanda Holliday in the tower hangar
---
“Use the arc charge” 
---
The worst Destiny boss fight I’ve ever encountered, an absolute disappointment
---
Well, he didn't have to. The Cabal came to him in the beginning of D2. And they were literally endless, he should be dead.
---
This idea is excellent and as a clothes-(w)horse Guardian, I would spend a fucking lot on every last component in Eververse.
---
Personal goals best goals. Setting myself a grind to execute a cool-idea-gun would be a lot of fun.
---
About a million players daily as well
---
I can't headbutt your skullplate in without walking closer.
---
It was an accident, first time posting
---
That was pretty epic. Ngl I would love to see more.
---
No problem ♥️
---
I do wonder why we need our ghost to call down our ship. Couldn't we just have a fucking remote control?
---
If only I could fully utilize all those great exotic bows, better get round to the Hush grind.
---
Are curated rolls platform specific or do PC players cheer for say a range masterwork curated roll while console players frown because it's not stability?
---
Probably zavala sitting in his precious castle
---
Get a Destiny LFG app and join some raids. Menagerie has some good looking armor. Basically every activity has an armor set tied to it. The repeat armor is part of the game. Just keep grinding. 25 hours isn’t even the tip of the iceberg for the end game.
---
Right?! Couldn’t have said it better. I’d rather have a good raid every 6 months than have a mediocre one every 2-3 months. 
---
I agree with the reckoning T3, I farmed it a lot more since they made it easier.
---
Every day. Same posts. Complain complain complain then a post about loving the game.
---
I can't get kills with sunshot because some sidestepping tard with recluse always makes me miss my shots.
---
I'm sorry but zavala's voice is just too god damn good, also operation oboe is one of my favorite lines in the game.
---
They mean the subreddit DestinyTheGame
---
And I feel like other hunters could be better qualified then than me (I main hunter so I’ll use myself as an example) such as the oh so famous Marcus Ren,if he’s still alive,I haven’t gotten all the lore books so I dunno yet.
---
Fact
---
In your collections tab you can view different gear and it will say where pieces drop 👍 just stick with swapping your blue gear around till you hit 940ish then start building your legendary gear
---
The postmaster, zavala
---
He can't start a war with the awoken. They are not our enemies and now they are our new Allies. And the awoken had a Ahamkara, what else are they hiding that is super dangerous?
---
I'm not too sure on the lore of it (newlighter sorry), but iirc in warmind campaign, it mentions Rasputin being made by the Bray's. Dunno how well Rasputin would take a non-Bray translating for him. (Not to mention, Zavala would probably trust him less)
---
D1 has the best visually appealing iron banner gear tbh
---
To be fair, Zavala is not weak. He's still a pretty damn good Titan, and a fairly motivating and charismatic leader.
---
The reason why we doubt him and make fun of him is because he has made some stupid ass decisions in the last few years.
---
Whatever comes next. I’m sure I’ll be okay with the new changes. Upset the vanguards gonna have to change hunters from cayde and such. But that’s what happens when people die
---
Be honest, would you rather have Zavala calmly telling you you're doing poorly in crucible?
---
I feel like this will be the next focus on campaign, after we beat the pyramid.
---
That’s the magic of Destiny’s RNGesus...Mine is boots, class items and heavy weapons or snipers
---
Lmao, just to show how true this is, I’ve already seen a couple of people getting downvoted here for apparently no reason, and one neckbeard making a salty post, jesus titfucking christ, how toxic can they be.
---
Well tbh some of the complaints don’t need a solution stated, it should be obvious. “We hate armor affinity” get rid of armor affinity. “We have that seasonal artifacts only support certain play styles” let seasonal artifacts support all play styles.
---
Honestly I feel like in year 3 build variety has actually gotten MORE restrictive thanks to both of these things and they are easily the number one things ruining the game for me.
---
Haha, wow I didn't even think of that. Yeah, this is fucked.
---
Might be laggy but your accuracy is just as bad
---
Zavala can go fuck himself
---
I got past this soft cap by grinding the weekly powerful rewards listed under vendors. There are several in the tower, a featured planet, strikes, crucible, etc. These are what got me up to 950, and I was surprised by how fast I was able to do some of them.
---
Is it really that bad tho?
---
Yup. A good note is also, all Exo's have a number at the end of the name, Cayde-6 Saint-14 Banshee-44 Ada-1
---
You can trade planetary materials with the vendors on each planet e.g. Sloane on Titan takes Alkane Dust. About 50 materials per engram, I think?
---
Tower vendors work the same way, but they use tokens and such. You get those by playing crucible and gambit matches or running strikes. Those activities also reward you with gear.
---
There are raids and dungeons and the menagerie too. Oh, and you should unlock the Black Armory and check out Brother Vance on Mercury for prophecy weapons.
---
I don't know about Forsaken and Shadowkeep specific stuff, though, since I don't have those expansions.
---
Also, check out the collections tab on your character screen. There's usually a line on the gear info that tells you where you can get each one.
---
I want it, mail it to me for Xmas and ill nae nae for you
---
It's also easier to tell my friends that are new to D2 "find a class and subclass you like and do a few story missions to get used to the controls"
---
*Rather than* "OK, so you first need to get to 700 by playing story missions, crucible, and gambit. After that you need to unlock the dreaming city and do this thing call the Blind Well and any Weekly Challenge with a yellow icon. You're going to need to do that till your at least 730, then you're going to want to do a couple exotic quests to get gear that will help you survive the bridge. Text me once you do all that K BYE👋"
---
Got the same roll and it's bonkers, man.
---
Yo I have the entire set
---
I’m not gonna have a conversation if it’s opinion
---
Honestly pc is ready for it anyway until we can get some better anitcheat
---
I love it
---
Depends, does the activity you are doing have grenadier as a modifier?
---
Byf is the deckard cain of this universe
---
Hunter is the only good one the titan is just to round and the warlock is a warlock so you know
---
I just want large mob groups for the grenade and super bounties, damn it.
---
When you see lag like that youre supposed to shoot where they arent !
---
D2 iron banner armor in general is the worst
---
Recite the entire Space Jam script
---
Ha ha so true, you hit the nail right on it’s head.
---
Just saying, Cayde has one personality trait, and it’s that he’s funny. Having one characteristic is worse than having none. He’s a shit character
---
Like I’ve said it’s your opinion
---
"If you don't like it don't play it" is such a weak defense for a game. Why would you want to alienate people who're extremely invested in Destiny and buy the DLC?
---
Zavala good, why does everyone hate him
---
I know the game has some stuff I want added or fixed, but it’s still my favorite game rn. There’s so much to do and work for, and I don’t even have dlc yet (money is a bit tight rn). I love how there’s still so much even if you don’t pay for the dlc, something a lot of games lack
---
This is why I use bubble titan in pvp
---
The game is arguably at its most popular right now.
---
Omg I live this subreddit so much. I literally passed out when I found it.
---
Dude, that is what reddit is. Your sentence describes literally 80% of posts made across all subs.
---
If you want originality, you're SOL. That stopped about 13.7 billion years ago and the reposts have gotten lazier and lazier ever since.
---
It’s kinda insane lol, say anything that oppose their view and oh boy it’s gonna get interesting lol like criticism is good, it provides feedback,  but saying someone opinions is dumb just because it’s not your opinion isn’t criticism, that’s called being a jerk lol
---
Omg 😍😱😱😱😱😱
---
Oh of course. From zavala's point of view, they were the right choice.
---
Zavala is not an idiot. He's just a traditionalist, and is prudent to the point that it ends up leading to innaction.
---
That often means his plans boil down to "hunker down behind a wall", a strategy that gives him far less glory moments and a lower kill count than Saladin, Shaxx or Saint. But it keeps far more civilians alive.
---
I think Zavala Is doing fine, personally. I'd much rather have a city with strong walls than follow hawthorne, teach everyone how to use a gun and have them fly from abandoned barn to barn for safety.
---
that’s why i love this sub. DTG is a bunch of unhappy sweats. 
---
oh, and you can post pictures here.
---
Yea, all the bitching about content we haven't even got our hands on yet is just getting annoying.  My clan discord was a bitch fest during the live stream and I just had to close it down.
---
Zavala is a badass and deserves the credit he is due
---
Mandalorians do not exclaim. This is the way
---
Ha ha yup! I tried to post this in The DTG but you can post pictures there lol.
---
Yes thank you, and it's not even anger it can just be general concern about a game that believe it or not wasnt that good at a point
---
Check out our New Player’s Guide or FAQ to hopefully help you a bit.
---
It's not just the destiny community, it's all of humanity in regards to storytelling. There would no good story if not one character made a very bad decision and has to fix it. Story telling revolves around drama and stress. A pretty good example of this is Grey's Anatomy. Those storyline  and plots would not exist if everyone thought with a level head and clear mind.
---
Bounties are the best way to level up but I'd reccomend going through the story and just enjoying it till you get into the endgame content
---
Why did I just read this in TF2 scout’s voice?
---
I’ve never been a big fan of PVP, the most i enjoyed it was when i had my team for trials. This season has changed that though. Mayhem(i know this has been around) has been the only game mode i really enjoyed in D2 without my team, but now that I can solo queue in Comp i’m enjoying PVP more, but Momentum Control changed everything. I played too much Halo in middle school and high school, and this game mode gives me too many swat memories and i feel more powerful than ever, like i can actually clutch a full team coming onto a zone i’m defending. For me, this season has been the greatest PVP in all of destiny based on Momentum alone
---
Looks like a Riddick theme.
---
The F#$% they are... hand cannons are just skill intensive and reward precision, you miss a headshot your dead.
---
Nope.
---
You can do the same weapon more than once, but you would need to do them each week.  You can only get 2 frames per week with ballistics logs.  That means the first time on 2 different weapons each week, should count.
---
I got those ornaments and I can tell you they are always on.
---
Fair, but with that logic I won't be able to teach Hunters how to super charge their smoke bombs or how to force push their throwing knives. SPACE MAGIC!
---
I don’t think it knows what communication is.
---
Its peer to peer, if the host has bad int they all do
---
I completely agree.
---
The titans and warlocks get a one tap ability that doesn’t even require precision damage. The knife needs to be a precision hit to even one tap
---
Been getting it for hours now, just want to finish that GD miserable ass Randy's quest and get my title.
---
Thank you!
---
Link? Cuz that’s kinda hard to believe that D2 is one of the most popular games lol and I love the game
---
Hi yeah, Void is what I meant. :)
---
lol
---
Everyone at pax melbs made a meme of him we all hate him. (Phammy, myelin, everyone at cosmic)
---
Finish the Shadowkeep campaign on the moon.  You won’t gain anything by not doing it before Tuesday.
---
But the post is talking about artifact mods.
---
It would be more consistent, but I don't think it would be super usable. Normally I look for weapons that are very reactive for anti-barrier mods, so I think the charge up and long range would make it a lesser choice.

i feel like those 2 just dont mix well in the game... exos are often abused fighting machines for a purpose... hell saint was good enough to be reused 14 times, and cayde lies about his number... warlocks on the other side are more like jedi knights... not likely exos are gonna end up as warlocks as often as the other classes i assume
---
There’s been at least one time that if you had the physical disc, you could play and if you didn’t, you couldn’t.  Maybe 1-2 months ago for multiple hours.  So it’s not like it has absolutely no value.  But prob not $10.
---
Orpheus rig is the best piece you can use for void hunter, everything else is all personal taste, especially your weapons
---
Yes in a town called Batavia there is a particle collider that you can see from google earth. Giant ring that smashed atoms together. The brought some of their tech to the Hadron collider in Switzerland
---
[removed]
---
Because this scene didn't make it in the game.
---
Why the hell did they not put that in? I loved it so much. I wish Destiny had more cutscenes like that
---
I wish it had more variety. Just so few stuff most of the time, most of which arent any good.
---
I’m still shocked they killed our boy
---
Better waste $10 on SOD than waste a single cent on a mobile game or in Shitnite
---
Spawning really far away from where you're fighting is annoying.
---
&gt;**By removing forever unsatisfied, crying about unreal potential players we keep destiny for players who enjoy activities D2 has to offer. Win - win iuam. I have yet to see one positive improvement for Destiny from these hates on devs**
---
**Actually, game developers generally don't want to actively kill off their customers.  It only means less revenue for them, and it literally doesn't affect you as a player AT ALL except you have a worse matchmaking experience.  Other people complaining about the game are things you're exposing yourself to.  It's not something that affects you in-game at all.  There have been plenty of suggestions to improve PvP and plenty of threads about it.   Here, I'll even show you an example, almost 5000 upvotes in** r/destinythegame **now:**  [https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/e6h17i/at\_the\_end\_of\_the\_day\_pvp\_players\_just\_want\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/e6h17i/at_the_end_of_the_day_pvp_players_just_want_a/)   
---
That thread has a lot of constructive feedback that is just not whining, and there is zero reason to remove players like that.  They're giving feedback about what would make the game better.  Developers want feedback.
---
&gt;They don't enjoy the game then. They want a different game and complain about not getting it the way they wanted.
---
False.  You can enjoy PvP and wish that it had more features or more frequent balancing.  That doesn't mean that you don't like the game.
---
&gt;This I do not follow, any examples of contructive major game breaking mistakes pointed out by these peeps?
---
You're right, you don't follow.  I said don't confuse people wanting more out of PvP as the same thing as people not liking the game.  There's a difference, and it's not ok to just want those people to play a different game because they want more out of this one.As for suggestions, it's not hard to come up with ones that wouldn't break the game.  A better ranked system, closer matchmaking (huge skill gaps in current matchmaking), a better system to work towards rewards than just getting win streaks (challenges, special armor sets), voting on maps, unlockable crucible ornaments/mods.  One of the biggest things is just more frequent attention.  There's a sandbox update like once every 3-4 months, that's not nearly e
---
depends, you can bring cayde back and then "destroy" the time machine we used to bring cayde back...
---
id like a gamora like revival where we dont save cayde from dying but steal one from the past, one who isnt as experienced, maybe not even a vanguard yet, and who has to learn a bit before he gets on the same level as our cayde was... would be interesting
---
bounties, burn as many bounties as you can.
---
I got d1 when d1 was 2 or 3 months away from launch and it was 4 bucks at gamestop, I say put d1 physical copy at 5 bucks for people who want it
---
Excellent point, I just wonder what it would take to change D2's server infrastructure to allow for dedicated servers. The client itself is based on a hybrid P2P/P2S protocol that allows for instancing into PVE areas. It would be interesting to see what would be needed to allow for Crucible to go full P2S.
---
But but candy crush new expansion!! And the new dance emotes in shitnite!
---
Ok sounds good I’ve already done a few missions
---
If we don't learn from mistakes we're doomed to repeat them, right?
---
We’re talking about toxic people acting out in detriment of a group. Comparing salty tryhards whining and bitching for not getting -exactly- what they want, in -exactly- the way they want and -exactly- how they want it, in detriment of a full subreddit, seems like a pretty accurate simile if you ask me.
---
Edit: not only is the point them being toxic, but then in comes that fella defending said toxicity with “they just love the game”, and “it’s called giving a shit”.
---
I couldn’t make up a more similar scenario to domestic abuse even if I tried lmfao.
---
In my country they sell it I believe at 4 bucks
---
Vex Offensive Bounties nonstop. Each run probably gets you a level.
---
mm nope. they said they wanna get it in the right place. they didn't say a season will focus on it. they said it will take time. they can't just make it bette like that. stop pulling shit out of your ass

Reacquire from collections or log in and out

I dont get it?

I volunteer.

I actively paly. I love the game. But im still gonna be like "hey bungie this aspect is shite mate lets fix it yea?"
---
and i do it BECAUSE I love the game.
---
Surprised this got so heavily downvoted, though I guess you came off as pretty aggressive. I agree overall; I didn't really like how Cayde's character changed from D1 to D2. He was a prankster who didn't take himself seriously in D1 Taken King, don't get me wrong. But in D2 it felt to me like he got seriously Flanderized and basically became Deadpool. I never got the feeling in D1 that he was stupid or even incapable of being serious; he seemed to respect his role as the Hunter Vanguard and just did things his own way and disregarded procedure. In D2 you have to wonder how he manages to get anything done with how much of a pure comic-relief character he became.
---
I think it depends on what you're looking for. Destiny's pvp is a bit on the casual side, which means that there will be a lot of frustrating but fun to use weapons/abilities. So strictly for a chaotic fun experience, its worth a try.
---
If your looking for something competitive, I'd suggest overwatch or csgo instead. Halo reach also just released on pc, and even though its not the most competitive halo its still pretty competitive.
---
I have done alt accounts before for carry purposes (I stopped a long time ago but will accept downvotes cause I agree thats horrible), and I think you can be pvp ready in maybe 2hrs depending on what blue/green weapons drop for you. I still think its best you try it out first since it is F2P.
---
If its something you end up enjoying I do have a few tips.
---
1. Master your movement. 
---
When I play on higher rank games my first indicator of wether or not my enemy is good is their movement. Do they use their slides or are they just running into the open? Are they in the air for too long? Simple things that mean a lot when you're playing pvp. The biggest thing I would say is learn how to slide into gunfights. Makes you a much more difficult target.
---
2. Positioning.
---
This is pretty straightforward for most fps players, so I'm kinda just putting this as a reminder. Always make sure you have an escape route or cover to get into, and remember that positioning is also relative to what weapon you have and what the enemy has. Give yourself the advantage.
---
3. Loadouts.
---
There will be some loadouts that are just superior to others, but there is a ton of weapons that are viable. Sometimes it just depends on what you pair with said weapon. For example; if you have a sidearm you wouldn't want to pair it with a shotgun, go with something with a bit more range. Make sure your loadouts are versitile enough that you'll rarely feel like you don't have an option.
---
4. Radar.
---
Yup, we have that so make sure to look at it from time to time. Pretend like its your car's side-view mirror.
---
This is why I own seige
---
Get this to Bungo pls
---
PREACH
---
That's my point, when I hover over it in collections it doesn't let me re squire it as if I don't own it
---
Would this https://imgur.com/abyYqpe work instead of Fighting Lion?
---
And I could use Chaperone instead of Parcel, maybe?
---
Petta venj
---
I guess it's not if you don't have friends to do it with.
---
Yea, I've been super lucky with these guys. I met a few of them randomly during a run of VOG and have been playing with them ever since. The only reason I really play Destiny anymore is because I always look forward playing with them. Hell, I probably wouldn't be playing video games as much as I do if it wasn't for them. I wouldn't trade my homies for the world &lt;3
---
Jajajaj no i think that we are agree in more things than you might think, but between i am not very good speaking (writing) in english and you are discussing things with me things that both are probably agree or not very disagree just we have this conversation of "besugos" like we say in my country.  
---
I think the opposite of the fans of warframe being indifferent, i think that are frustatred with the content droughs, certain flaws of design, and burn out, have all the things... and me to, and me to i am waiting for content, jus enter when i miss my warframes, the movement, or break the head a nox, but the thing is not are indifferent about the game, so still there is love for the game. Maybe this time i explain better.   
---
With destiny, i play destiny since d1, even before that found warframe, and i love both, probably now not gonna lie a little more warframe with all their flaws, but the best is try to enjoy all the games possible, think that after 1000 hours when the developers give you 10 hours sounds like nothing but are a lot. Now enjoying borderlands and path of exile, just check the maggie, oh boy, never gonna be in the world other weapon like maggie. 
---
Here or there or in other different place enjoy that it´s the important.
---
\*slaps side of rifles\* "These bad boys can let you spray so many bullets!"
---
Like what theories?
---
you havent fully completed the quest
---
In this case, I'm just referring to how Destiny's servers operate, not latency. I'm a bit off-topic compared to what the original post is implying, I haven't had too many issues with Crucible lag shenanigans personally. lol
---
I thought I was the only one, I really do not mean to Tbag it just happens.
---
This is oddly cute.
---
It's less about kinetic (primary) and energy but more about exotic and legendary.  They're both effectively ad clear weapons, so I'd rather use a legendary where I can.
---
I'd rather run recluse and Izanagi than Juju and Beloved, for example.  Does that help answer your question?
---
Read somewhere that the Vex can move things and replace them, that’s why Vex structures outdated Venus itself; because they existed before, Linda like copy and paste, just with timelines instead of essays.
---
They're probably doing some extra prep for the new season.  Don't want the tackle-hug of doom killing their servers once Season of Dawn starts next week.
---
Same
---
By can't pick up anymore you mean that it's slightly greyed out right? That means you've done every bounty for that week (for weekly bounties) so you have to wait for the weekly reset or a day for the daily bounties
---
I just keep getting getting fucked by that long nosed ass tapir.
---
Did you read and understand the reply?
---
Looks like mahogany, ginger, and blood orange to me
---
Okay, gotcha.
---
In the Nessus strike when he doesn’t hear from you he decides to personally lead the next fireteam to come save you. Zavala values us greatly because no other guardian can match out stature currently.
---
Or factions
---
Yes it's grey. But there are still more weekly bounties like gambit in vanguard. I don't get it!?
---
Those are some nice thighs you've got there
---
Nobody show him vex babies
---
If ur a OG old gardien from d1 to now show some luv for bungie. Kept me busy when the gf is out and now it keeps me busy late taking care if my baby son.
---
It's the izanagis burden quest, that's why I need the rare bounty. The rng gods have not been kind
---
Lol I meant it with love, Guardian!
---
So this is the part where you start word vomiting and sidestepping everything I called you out on other than having a hate boner for Byf.
---
Well, at least you got your attention.
---
Have a good evening Fisho.
---
I liked trials cuz it kept sweaty PvP players out of QP on weekends, allowing me to have fun and be decent. Now I get matched with Unbroken players if I win 2 IB matches in a row.
---
It’s dope!
---
Got some solid perfume with Black Friday deal, couldn't resist the Destiny reference.
---
The reason he used fighting lion was the shield shred capabilities. Id reccomend using something that can shred shields, so arc would work nicely vs captains
---
And then they start Tbagging you the rest of the game
---
Exactly
---
No worries, that video (there are others obviously, just once I saw the other day) really goes into it pretty in depth, should explain it quite well. No doubt *the* build to go with for soloing hard stuff where there's tons of adds.
---
Who is hiding dummy, could not care about karma, just stating what I have noticed about destiny as I have been playing since D1, you and the rest are too stupid to see what is wrong with the game which is the only reason you is commenting.
---
I mean why would i video a friend hatting on someone? They were giving me free drinks from the twitch bar why would i stab them in the back? So no i dont have proof if thats the proof you want.
---
But I own the gun and can pick it up from the Nessus barge over and over. What else is in the quest after owning it?
---
You think this is bad hit up the Modern warfare one it's not good right lol
---
#bringbacktwilightgarrisonplzbungie
---
...I’m scared...
---
I don't think it would be hard to put it in the game, but why would they put in a SUPER competitive PvP mode when nobody thinks that PvP is well-balanced or in a good place overall? Not to mention all of the DDOS, harassment, paid "carry" services, and general toxicity that came with it and they don't have a solution for.
---
Genuinely dont get why the hunter vanguard needs to chill in the Tower. Vanguard are supposed to be mentors to the guardians of their class. Sure, Titans built the wall, makes sense their vanguard would be there, teaching to defend the people of the City. Warlocks, collectors of lost knowledge and arcane light, their libraries are in the wall. 
---
But Hunters are explorers, they originally gathered refugees and lead them to the city, their Vanguard should be out there, on the front lines educating future Shin Malphurs and Nightstalkers.
---
Bungo's made by a bunch of furries and they want to shove that fact down our throats
---
Lulzzz
---
And he'll probably go back to being dead soon enough because we have to fix the timeline they undoing
---
OI SAINT-14, I USED THE POWER OF MY STAND「ZA HANDO」, TO FUCKING ERASE THE UNDYING MIND FROM THE VEC TIMELINE, AND NOW EVERYTHING IS MESSED UP, ISN'T THAT WACKY?
---
r/unexpectednickcage
---
Edit:  was making that link thinking that that sub didn't exist...how wrong i was.
---
Who cares what’s wrong with the game? 
---
Problems get fixed with time, the games playable and fun so really nothing else matters that much to just be a crappy person and shit talk for the sake of it.
---
Comparing Bungie to a multi-billion dollar company that has the resources to do something on that scale *without* having to dumb down their initial pitch of the product was probably not a good example.
---
Look, I’m not saying that Bungie deserves a break because the world of Destiny is something they promised us and more. However, expecting them to deliver on things they:
---
1) never promised
---
2) literally can’t promise
---
And then actively complaining online when you don’t get what you want like it is a sure thing to happen is a stupid thing to do as a consumer.
---
I'm new what are Trials and why should I care?
---
Go to Holiday, get campaigns, start there
---
I got finished sooner than I expected to, so if you DM your steam ID on here, I can join up on you.
---
Man I wish those ornaments worked on any armor not just the IB sets :/
---
Bruh he said strike exclusive not console exclusive 😂😂
---
There is literally no point in playing quickplay now that I am at the soft cap.
---
F in the chat for Cayde-6
---
You have a few trees as warlock with 3 different elements, arc, solar, and void. It’s up to you which you use, totally playstyle based. Go to Amanda Holliday at the tower, she can give you access to the different campaigns. The red war is the first one, and arguably the best place to start. 
---
The elements on gear only matters for mods, which can improve certain elements of your character. You can only equip mods to gear that have matching elements. Highest level you can get to rn is around 960 as a hard cap, but can go past by getting Pinnacle Gear, which is always going to be a higher light level.
---
Speaking of light level, that’s the power number you were talking about. Equip what’s best for now until you can get nitpicky. Alternatively, if you really like a piece of gear, you can destroy one that’s a higher level to make that gear match. That’s the infuse area when your inspecting a weapon/ armor peace. 
---
But start with campaigns, will help you get a hold of the game, you’ll learn more as you go.
---
Because when people go out of their way to diss game services for something that is the player’s own fault, it’s not a good look for anybody. If you like the game, you wouldn’t publicly shame it for your own problem.
---
Its 2019 why are you wasting time making events heroic the math has been solved since y1
---
And the vex sparrow. And even though technically it's not a raid, you mean to tell me that the ship, sparrow and ghost that have the Red Keep look could not easily, EASILY, be from shit like PoH or Altar of Sorrows? Or even be the exclusive loot for Scarlet Keep? Or have a chance at them with every 980 Nightmare Hunt?  And yes, I know that PoH and Altar have their own loot but come on... Them shits look nothing like the loot that goes into Eververse.
---
Also, currency, save glimmer, it’s used for just about everything. Legendary shards help upgrade armor or buy engrams among other things. Bright dust is used for cosmetics.
---
It’s to keep you from immediately dying again...
---
It was a joke, but I understand it was not taken as such and apologize for my own negligence. Jokes may be funny to one, but not to another. I see my wrong and will do my best to learn from it.
---
I'd recommend you try on the forums over at bungie.net
---
Machine gun?
---
Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather, he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank just outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold.
---
don't remember how much each gives exactly tbh, just quoting what other people tell me, what i do know is that submachinist is slightly less than 1 full %, don't remember how much cold fusion is since i pretty much did submachinist only since flanking campers in momentum is mostly easy mode unless the spawns get you
---
Gg man
---
Jokes on them. The guys on the couch are playing Halo.
---
Awoken hunter here...
---
While the reward isn't the greatest exotic since it's been nerfed, it is required to complete the wayfarer seal if you plan on doing that.
---
I finished this quest yesterday so it shouldn’t be broken. Do you have nascent dawn active, particularly the step that asks to find a specific cache? That stops you from combining other resonant stems.
---
The quest is "The Machine's Gun". It starts from a world quest on Mars.
---
The loot sucks hard rn, but other than that it's still ok. But that is a big problem for a looter-shooter
---
No, "banshees favorite" perk is an exotic perk for ghost shells; however, you still can get any of the analyzer perks on the random rolled perk.
---
We've been had!
---
They're resurrecting XIV so that HE can be the new hunter vanguard
---
OH sorry I read that wrong
---
Zavala just *looks* gross
---
It's going to be Menagerie, with a less labyrinthine map, with Champions, and Hive swapped out for Cabal.  Also, the boss will be different every few weeks.  
---
Which all sounds like an improvement over the Vex Inoffensive.
---
How do you know it isn't?
---
Actually yes. Thank you. That looks like the problem.
---
Do it for shaxx
---
I see thanks.
---
Does the sole survivor ornament change the sigh of the gun? Do instead of triangle
---
I love my little light
---
Couldn’t have said it better myself. The season pass is $10(!) for 3 months of content. You can’t even play laser tag for $10. And the season rank gives $30-40 of cosmetic items by itself. I’ve bought silver before and I’ll gladly do it again, especially after learning that the sales for the whisper of the worm ornaments literally paid for the team to develop the Zero Hour/outbreak mission. I still pretty much only play destiny, and I don’t mind spending a few bucks on silver here or there to say thank you and get some exclusive gear. I shouldn’t even call it gear... it’s really just cosmetic. I’m not gaining an advantage from buying an emote, and I’m not paying to win because they don’t sell mods or raid armor.
---
Oh you poor thing...
---
I dunno how coordinated you can be with your team, but the strategy I used went like this:
---
1. Once you enter the boss fight first clear all mobs with the two turrets on both sides.
---
2. Then shoot the boss until the first servitor appears.
---
3. (If available) a hunter uses a Tether on the servitor and then (if available) the warlock does a nova on it. Ideally with Skull of Dire Ahamkara you get some of your super back and by collecting the orbs of the hunter you'd be getting it back to full. The same with the hunter with the orbs you created.
---
4. If you got supers back do tge same with the second servitor, if not use grenades and heavy.
---
5. Now destroy the Shanks with the arc shields around the arena if there are any and the proceed to the fallen tanks. If you position yourself between the walls and the tank the boss shouldn't be able to hit you there and you can focus on the tanks and ideal focus all your efforts on one tank at a time.
---
6. Now kill all the adds except and remember the 3 invisible dudes, they can be a pain. BUT keep one sniper in the back alive so that no additional adds can spawn, then focus on the boss with all you got. If the sniper dies anyway fir some reason a hunter (if available) should tether them asap.
---
If your teamwork is somewhat decent it can even be done with only 2 people. I would've helped, but I'm on Playstation, sry.
---
So then does Guiding light work the same where you can’t get it as a random perk?
---
I always do heroic if there are people who know how. But sometimes it’s just more work for nothing. Some quests don’t require it and people would rather just get it done than do more for nothing
---
Well, I'm not really sure we can agree on this, but I think there is some common ground to find. I don't think the community is complaining so much as giving feedback. The degree of value that feedback has varies, and some of it is pretty worthless. Explaining content gaps, what we would like to see, and comparing new content to old - really should not be taken as complaining. 
---
Did I make the best analogy? No. But I do fail to see how many and resources affect the very low level I was explaining. Replace Google with any company you like that makes a product you like, that then goes off on their own, to make an arguably worse product - and complaining is seen as, idk, mean, maybe rude? Like no, I vote with my money and have since the beginning. Seasons are optional now, that's reasonable. I just don't see it as the only way to give feedback to a company is not to buy their product, maybe tell them why, what they can do to fix it, etc, etc. 
---
In regards to Trials, specifically, it's just time to come clean. Put a date on it, something tangible, or admit it isn't on the table. There is too much unanswered demand. Not being straight about it is causing people to speculate and then further miss expectations. Yes, there is ALWAYS going to be an expectation that Trials is returning whenever the next season is, simply because Bungie likes to be surprising. They kinda need to knock that off, this is no longer a player base that enjoys being surprised, at least not when it comes to feature requests. That's best left for that 110% over-the-top surprise that we didn't know was coming and never requested.
---
Aye! Northern Illinois over here!
---
M’whining about OEM
---
For hunters they should add a quick golden gun headshot finisher
---
There was a bounty in D1 called “Aim for the Juicebox” for killing Vex with precision shots.
---
How is that different from Comp nowadays?
---
Fun % has gone to stonks numbers as last time it was rabbits and lions farming you now its Randys and mountaitop
