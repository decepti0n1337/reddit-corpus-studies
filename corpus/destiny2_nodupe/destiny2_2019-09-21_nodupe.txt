Wait when was Dawnblade that good? I thought that was fairly recet
---
---
---
Nevermind. Found it. Thanks guys :)
---
Is it a quest that you need the one on Mars or can you get it on Titan?
---
Let‚Äôs raid it :)
---
nigga why you gotta reference jojo
---
After being disappointed that I didn't get shit from doing the weekly challenges, Xur gives me exactly what I was looking for, Skullfort. Sorry for calling you bad names after you sold Chromatic Fire for the 3rd time in 6 weeks but seriously, don't do that shit again.
---
Does he know that yet! (awkward...!) üòé
---
Hate's a strong word, my dude. Why do you dislike it/them so much? It's been around for decades and is simply an older version of T-posing, both of which are harmless and spark some in game rivalry. I actually love it's existence as it spurs me on to fight harder. Not just to win, but to prove my skill against a cocky opponent. It's like a modern day version of throwing down the guantlet. He bagged and declared a duel, so I will accept it and defeat him.
---
must be bhind the bushes
---
Since jokers wild
---
It's not just a destination
---
So uh...I'mma ask the more important community questions here for my hungry folks:
---

---
Who would you bang? Shaxx or Cayde and if so are you single?
---
as in... still sells it?
---
You too?
---
It‚Äôs for two completions for some reason
---
Blue shirt is shaxx, I'm hundo P Cayde!
---
Lol this guy you only need like 50 precision kills with a hand cannon for ace.
---
I run a 1080ti , im consistently in the 90-120 fls range depending on population. In the tower I average around 80. I rarely get the full 144hz. I have all settings at ultra though, V-sync off an no framerate cap. You're not going to average 144 fps no matter how good you're card is unless you lower your settings
---
The sandbox is great fun until the first guy gets his super, then the whole game just becomes a rolling shitfest of one shot roaming supers
---
BrianMoncus just dm him on Instagram and see what he says
---
Anyone wanna be my Best friend?
---
Have fun with that blue and one planetary material.
---
Sadly I cannot tonight. My buddy was helping his friends with comp and needed account which isn't in high tier this season, so I let him play on mine. I might be online tomorrow tho. =)
---
awe shucks... i still need to grind for recluse as well! damn so much stuff to finish in just a few day
---
Since you can buy these for real money, Bungie is required by some country's law to post drop rates. [From here, you can see the armor pieces have a 20% drop chance.](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/47066#S7BrightEngram)
---
Boooooooo. It's all good. Titan, hunter this season.  Can't deal with the Warlock jump lmao.
---
[removed]
---
LMAO at this failed humblebrag
---
For Recluse yeah? Depending on how much time I will have (having exam next week, so kinda also busy studying for instance), I might play some comp with you. And if not, I could possibly ask my friend, who is kinda doing these carries (for free) and he might help you grind it. Usually it is very quickly done and he has a full stack at disposal, so it goes very smooth.
---
what kind of grenade launcher are you using there?
---
oh man, I'm so sad, I'll probably do the quest and lament on things that couldn't be.
---
will your friend have room tonight, cause that would be dope.. i could stream and grind it out!
---
R u on ps4?
---
Is that the try hard set up?
---
It‚Äôs not really that serious, it‚Äôs Rumble. Lol.
---
hunters -&gt; lovely
---
Ofc.
---
Yet warlock never gets nice looking armor, just look at the EP armor or the Dreaming City set
---
Thanks man! He just recently started editing his stuff like this and he‚Äôs doing pretty good!
---
its pretty unalive
---
Aw that's a shame. I personally love playing destiny 2 but my husband doesn't want to play anymore so I don't really have anyone play with
---
They are a "special" breed alright
---
That's awesome!
---
I might just be on mushrooms but are they the same person?
---
Shadowkeep will bump him up to 750, don‚Äôt worry!
---
Why fortnite man. We were this close to greatness
---
You forgot the impressive part
---
This is awesome, I wish I had made a connection like that, lol so jealous
---
Is this Russian propaganda?
---
r/imsorryjon
---
I hate you with a burning passion
---
Post Malone ? Jotuun is a toaster? Therefore toast Malone .. pretty fuckin funny
---
Of course not that would actually make sense
---
Man lucky you you‚Äôll get some dusklight shards IRL
---
Destiny item manager is better
---
Ahhhhh ok, thanks for explaining despite my annoyance
---
A fast way to level up would most likely be camp a place that has high enemy spawn rates and amount and common events happen along with go in and out of lost sectors that works as well as they will respawn every time I believe and you can get good armor as well from the boss chest in there
---
For a kinder guardian so makes sense.
---
No I had it made by someone.
---
Seriously when did Garfield become a ninja turtle? And what in the actual fuck does this have to do with gambit? It‚Äôs not even a remotely decent crossover...
---
I'm assuming you have forsaken since you're above 390 or whatever the vanilla cap is. If you do, you should have access to the AP content, including the forges, reckoning and menagerie as well as some more raids and exotic quests. If you don't have forsaken, the vanilla game will gain access to both forms of gambit, the forges, reckoning and the menagerie on October first.
---
‚ÄòRightfully bagged‚Äô lmfao. How about you go bag a crocodile

Luckily my God roll spare rats also has high cal rounds, so I'll just switch to flinching the shit out of people.
---
He snitching on everyone. It's a meme now
---
I got an eye of the storm opening shot, and a snapshot range finder one. Both have accuraized rounds and extended barrel/hammer forge rifling
---
Depth of field off, make sure your render scaling is at 100%, hope D3 is more optimized.
---
You need to take this issue up with someone on /r/CruciblePlaybook.
---
It has nothing to do with us.
---
I was too busy being relieved, it just wasn‚Äôt my problem anymore; if anything, I was VERY understanding of the decision.
---
thank you, much appreciated. I promise to google the next thing I need to google in your honour!
---
It was a bag for bag situation, he gets toxic I get toxic.
---
Yes actually when she came to visit we swung by but didn‚Äôt realize you can‚Äôt go inside :( we just peeked in the windows and left

Because that‚Äôs what good people do.
---
You can not reset your glory rank. It will reset at the end of each season.
---
Shadowkeep?? Whats that??
---
Edit: I just realised you propably meant Chad O‚ÄôKeefe
---
Sorry, dumb autocorrect.
---
SNIIIITCH
---
No Capp
---
A lot of the game is about to be free. Your best bet is to wait till October 1st where you can probably get every part of the game and DLC for like 80$ on Steam
---
Only thing I love to use in pve is jotunn. I hope it doesnt get nerfed.
---
Read that as," don't know if you need foreskin."
---
I should go to sleep.
---
I replaced them :), that video was before that tho
---
Just make sure you have at least 1 of each in your INVENTORY! Any that are on weapons already will not count!
---
The drifter gives you a quest to go and complete some gambit prime bounties, just follow that and you‚Äôll be able to unlock it
---
I know that, what I mean is let‚Äôs say I have 2 rampage specs but I want to put them on 3 different guns in shadowkeep. Do I 1) have to find and hold on to a third one or 2) dismantle one because in addition to being reusable they also don‚Äôt need a copy for each weapon you want them on
---
Dismantle lengendary equipment
---
In Shadowkeep you‚Äôll be able to reuse as many times as you like. They no longer will be consumables which means if you have it, you can put it on every gun if you like
---
How did you find a match for Reckoning?
---
New campaign, lores and hoping for new exotic catalysts
---
Try Ladies of Destiny on FB!
---
The PVP has been bad pretty much the entire time since D2 launched. Supposedly the are going to refocus on improving the PVP experience over the next few months.
---
i am not sure about forsaken, but you can buy shadowkeep only on steam, so as long as your bnet and steam accounts are linked, you are good
---
Why the surprise? That game and Gamestop are old and outdated. The controller options are straight out of 2001's Halo: Combat Evolved üòÇüòÇ
---
WtfüòÇ
---
Yep 
---
&gt;a warlock shakes a shitty quality chair in your direction while yelling about getting off his lawn&lt;
---
Oh right, I see - was debating holding off getting shadowkeep as I thought people had it pre-ordered on [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) \- do I need to buy any pre requisites or can I just upgrade from the first dlc packs to  Destiny 2: Shadowkeep Digital Deluxe Edition?
---
what?
---
Hyper speed activated.
---
Actualy I spent some time playing PlanetSide 2, where u have bulletdrop, bulletspeed and a lot larger maps :D Totaly different experience from destiny. Also nearly no lags (while here I can get kicked out of match for some connection problems). But ps2 is trying to follow some physics and be more ‚Äúreal‚Äù, while destiny has totaly different concept :D And yea, I find it funny, but its different
---
I would have loved a skill based, oldschool twitch shooter style special "rocket launcher" 
---
Something that does a bit of splash damage but shoots a small projectile that demands direct hits for kills 
---
I guess mtop is pretty close to that, but not exactly what I'm looking for
---
Does the crucible actually give them as rewards ive got some from dismantling legendary gear and ive heard about spider any way to get some in the red war campaign
---
I've actually had a really good time farming with blueberry's. I never really liked reckoning that much but now it's just a lot of fun to play
---
It‚Äôs his?
---
Get your power to 420 then we‚Äôll talk
---
They have set drop rates tho
---
Nice
---
YOU ARE A VIRGIN!
---
I wanted it for soooooooo long. I used to bitch everytime I‚Äôd get an exotic and it wasn‚Äôt them for months. 
---
Then one day me and 2 friends did a tier 4 Blind Well and I got it from the chest and almost shit my pants
---
Nah looks like he's been getting fucked in the crucible
---
Holy shit, if I could give you gold I would.
---
He said "speedy" not "tiny"
---
Us that datto?

Sanity. A small price to pay for salvation.
---
Hope you payed her.

Nerf recluse.
---
Oh most definitely.

I saw a pretty steady diet of 2- and 3-stacks yesterday, with a single four mixed in.  I think the philosophy of IB has changed a little in this last round, since many players have finished the quests to open up the Iron Truage armor (especially the step that required swords, scout rifles, etc.) and can go back to their meta loadouts.  
---
The rewards attached to it are basically "time served" activities, so (rather than Bungie's "You need 500 left-handed precision kills while your team has advantages and the moon is in Libra" quests) players just need to complete about 40 matches (for the Victory Banners bounty, though the number slides down a bit with wins).  That means a decent number of players who think of IB as a recreational mode are fiddling around with loadouts as the sweats who've finished up all their other quests pour in.  It can make for some especially toxic matches, especially when those stacks turn out to be the 4th, 5th, and 6th-best players on their teams.
---
When so many people signed up for a teaching raid that I had to make a second one and when the raid starts we're still missing people for the first one. I swear there were over 9 people and the ones who couldn't join sounded so disappointed and no one knew the raid.
---
The grind is going to be hell after the reload nerfs...

Woke me up for the day

Wouldn't happen to have the template would you?
---
With Destiny 2 being released on steam, kazotsky kick should be added
---
Make sure you use mods and use weapons that have the  major spec or shield break perks. Took us 4 tries then took a break and redid our load out. Once everyone's modded up and got good loadouts it's a cakewalk my guy.
---
Learn alone the jumping part and trevor. Will be easier for your teammates. 
---
I was used to clear alone the 3 first rooms and practice the jumps.
---
Thanks
---
at least she admits it. haha
---
I would suggest any exotic that improve jumps ( Iron Rampart for titans and Stompee5 for Hunters) and for the boss encounter legend of acrius or any other weapon that hits like a truck would be great for the spider tanks.
---
üòÇ
---
GOODNESS.
---
I really don't know what to say to this.
---
You don't know me, how I raid, how I approach teaching people.
---
You've looked at a single comment on Reddit and made a huge uneducated assumption towards the negative that indicates to me that you are in fact a person I would rather not raid with.
---
I simply do not understand how anyone who has (successful) raid experience would _ever_ want to do a match-made raid.
---
Like whats been said in other places in this thread - wanting to experience the raids forces you to reach out and join a clan, meet people, gain friends and enjoy the game together.
---
Imagine if you never did that because there was a match-made option; and imagine how bad that first experience would have been.
---
I probably would have quit D2 because of that without knowing how good the raid experience actually is.
---
I do own Forsaken too, so i guess it's only Shadowkeep i'm missing then. Thanks a lot for the reply.
---
[deleted]
---
Skipnades much?
---
Ok.  But that one dance is literally arc staff hunters
---
Giving you a thumps up, because you're right. How's queues etc for strikes and crucible etc atm, i do wonder if there's a lot of people playing now or if it's hard to find games. Reinstalling atm.
---
Except snipers are easy to counter if youre not a shotgun ape.
---
Why not both????
---
Oh fuck u !! I don‚Äôt have a gf (((
---
Lol this may be true for some but I got bored of using it because it was too easy.
---
She gonna cheat on you though lol
---
It's more fun when you bring someone's ego back down to earth. I'll save my nova bomb for when I see a oem titan use his super.
---
it looked pretty aggressive
---
Bring the right burns for shields, ive attempted it over 20 times because my teammates can't clear ads fast enough
---
Get everyone to use different types of roles like destroying certain shields or killing snipers
---
I mean, it‚Äôs not plain black, so those asking for plain black aren‚Äôt really going to be eureka‚Äôing over this OP.
---
spazzing out
---
In all fairness, the white and orange ornament looks pretty sick
---
Once Chad o'Keefe drops everything will be bumped to 750
---
It's as close as ur gonna get
---
Dude look behind you
---
I want that first part as a full size poster
---
As a Titan main, people who use OEM are exiled from our ranks
---
I‚Äôve gotten 11 kills with bottom striker on that map. So broken... Also was my 2nd of 3 49 kill games. i just want one 50...
---
What glitch is this?? Do tell..
---
Whats the bug?
---
Jotunn can do a ton of more damage if you point blank shoot the target and damage yourself
---
Sorry, I should have been more clear, I meant things like hair, gender, race
---
Apparently if you point blank shoot something with the full charge and hit yourself as well it does massively increased damage.  [Jotunn Glitch](https://youtu.be/u8BbjOk7SwE)
---
I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs some kind of character customization tho I doubt there will be. I feel like restarting my titan as well just for the sole reason of how ugly he is. I was thinking about vaulting all the armor and weapons he had right now (all 750), make a new titan, and just equip all the stuff from my old one. But I don‚Äôt exactly feel like going through the whole story again lol.
---
NANI?!
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather you lose than I win‚Äù
---
People who main titan and use OEM know why they are using it. All those arguments about whether it is broken or not is just a little mind game, nothing less, nothing more. People will always use what benefits them the post and especisally if they play something competitive or are competitive. And they have absolutely full right to do so. Either you win or lose in the game and there is no space for playing on honor and other things.
---
The game will be going F2P with the next expansion, Shadowkeep. If you buy Forsaken now, you'll have the game and the Forksaken expansion. If you want the full set, you'll have to purchase the Shadowkeep bundle as well. If you were just to preorder Shadowkeep, you'll get all the content in that expansion, but not Forsaken. Basically the game will be free, and you get the expansions that you buy.
---
*dude here knocked off the antenna by a tiny orbiting bit of the Traveler's hull*
---
Demonstration pls
---
I wouldn‚Äôt bother with armour right now, what with the big changes coming with Shadowkeep. You could do some forges in hopes of an exotic (j√∂tunn, Izanagi‚Äôs burden, or Le Monarque). You could also do the exotics quests for Outbreak Perfected (though I‚Äôd recommend have a fire team for that), Truth, Bad Juju, Lumina (again, fireteam would be optimal for this one), or Thorn.
---
You have to realize on console, every primary pretty much sucks and has EXCESSIVE amounts of recoil so majority of players lean towards easy weapons like 180 hand cannons, pulse rifles like bygones and erentil fusion rifles. If you use any other type of gun or archetype, you need a large amount of skill to outgun the easier to use guns. 
---
On pc this isn‚Äôt an issue because you can use any gun you want due to lack of recoil and still get fast time to kill. console meta is so boring and stale because every gun on console is ridiculously difficult to use and do good with. And bungie continues over and over to refuse to address and respond to the recoil issue.
---
Not mandatory, you'll just be missing a bit of content (some raids, guns, etc...). You're still allowed to go to the planet, just not perform any missions on it.
---
Stopies for that speed and jump boost
---
kindled orchid with kill clip + rampage can 2 tap and that's a 140, not considered op. also, you say "most" 140's like they do different damage or something. frontal assault is a direct damage increase, its not the only one in the game. inertia override, empowering melee, sun warrior, empowering rift, well of radiance. all of these things can be used in pvp and stacked with other damage increases such as kill clip / rampage / vengeance. not so much with vengeance though because its a tiny 5% increase so unless the target has very low resilience, it doesn't matter. the problem here is not frontal assault, but the way bungie lets buffs stack. stacking memento mori or kill clip with any of these buffs will make a 140 2-tap.
---
Keep adding to it.
---
Why no put Down well whilst reviving
---
I said "most" 140s because not all of them have very good range stats. Also, aside from empowering melee, most of those are very situational or require you to be in a small area
---
you're really making some wild assumptions here. my "K" was supposed to be ironic and poke fun at you for jumping on a bandwaggon and joining those whiny people you mentioned. all i did was point out that dawnblade is at the very least on the same level as bottom striker when it comes to super strength. you're starting to look pretty dumb backpedaling after realizing your post or reasoning hold no weight.
---
Yeah, I get that. It must be real damn hard to compete without random rolls
---
His hair looks so cute
---
Yes and the one that's tangled shore themed. Dunno the name usually don't get the map
---
That's so sick! Where did you get the keychain?

Every time I hear guardian I hear zavala

You can swear on the internet lol

This is, however. ‚ù§ :D
---
Scar is my favorite villain so this makes me laugh Everytime I see it
---
And make them cry you did
---
Idk man sounds like you need to work on holding territories and not just capturing them. I see tons of dudes with 30 kills take a loss because all they do is push and kill and force spawn swaps when they should just hold back and let the points stack.
---
Weekly game weekly mode weekly for the weekly week
---
Very true
---
Snek
---
It's lag. Similar things with corners happen literally ALL the time in this game. Shit I kill people with bygones by shooting the corner they just ran behind fairly frequently.
---
Forsaken ain't free, the annual pass is
---
This killed me, thanks OP, I needed that laugh lmfao
---
What because auto reload? Just get auto loading holster and chain swap heavy to special. And you never have to reload it. Yes less damage but still no reloads
---
I'm fuming I can't un-see or block this out üò≠

you are not good for holding forward towards your enemies whole being semi invincible lol

To add to this don't use private browsing messes with the linking of accounts, something to do with cookies or stored/current log in

I use the same thing other then the heavy being random. If u have a good roll on the parcel and trust it will do awesome.
---
3 fucking months farming 3 toons for that ship to get the title .....
---
does that hunter at 0:35 really kill himself with a rocket? watched it a few times now, and I still can't tell what happened
---
What? You want to be challenged, but complain crucible pinnacles are too hard to get?
---
Lol too funny
---
Menagerie by far is the most efficient DRB farm!  That‚Äôs if you have the runes.  The other farming methods consist of farming specific lost sectors.  Not very efficient that way.
---
The last step can be skipped in case you didn't know. Load into Tower and as soon as your ship pops up switch Character,repeat it.
---
Just dont even do it man thats my advice
---
Must have max gally?
---
Basically yeah. I used to run account recoveries for people in Trials and I would always livestream all gameplay, including providing a private video of me signing in and loading the game so that my clients would know I wasn‚Äôt doing anything suspicious. If you‚Äôre considering getting an account recov, I‚Äôd definitely recommend finding someone who is offering to livestream the gameplay for you so you can be positive nothing is going on. Also, afterwards, be sure to change your password so they have no access to the account
---
Dude it‚Äôs your whole PlayStation or xbox account you‚Äôre giving over. Don‚Äôt just give it to some random schlub on an lfg.
---
Ah ok well it‚Äôs a good loadout if the shotty has some good perks but if it doesn‚Äôt then I would use a different one, possibly chaperone if you have it, or I would use a sniper .
---
Get you some shotgun scavenger armor
---
Lol ok
---
Fair enough.
---
Btw, it's "said my _piece_".
---
To "hold my _peace_" means to stay quiet about one‚Äôs objections.
---
Something you probably should have done instead of angerly replying to every comment since this entire thread was just meant to be a funny joke.
---
I know right? That's what made me wonder about this
---
Fucker better stay away from my cores! I‚Äôve only just worked out how to use and accumulate them properly this season.
---
I'm gonna write an angry letter.
---
Does my flair not make it obvious
---
Fake news that‚Äôs not a couch
---
I got of a wallpaper app on destiny all it said was about bungie
---
It does... I just wanted to say it for once :(
---
No one never said being good?
---
May be. That feeling, when you like the game, you played your handcannon a lot and feel it good, and then you feel really really bad in pvp games. I will surely play a lot more pvp matches and will decide what to do.
---
Just wanted to clear if this game has a looot of cheaters and I shouldn't play pvp. Now I get that it was just my first exp at pvp. Will get better and see :-)
---
No. This game has very few cheaters and all of them are in the comp playlist.
---
I would run OEM but the perks that I have on it is garbage üòî
---
5 per character.
---
Oh yea no doubt
---
Follower earned
---
When I left ps4 it was the exact same
---
Well it's true that it only works in low to mid level games doesn't mean it doesn't have *any* advantages in a duel. Can't just disregard those situations

Phalanx: im about to end this whole mans career

Also, I think, for now, when I got a vanile version of the game, "better devils" is jot the worst gun in game. While I can't get forsaken, do you know any better handcannons I can get now? Thanks for your replies.
---
It‚Äôs perk is unlimited ammo but it doesn‚Äôt do any damage
