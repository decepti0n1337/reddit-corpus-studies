&gt; You don't need every item in the whole game, if acquiring it is not fun. 
---

---
I was about to quit for this reason, except the previous owner of this gun is someone pretty integral to the story. Not owning it because I don't want to suffer through PvP seemed like it would ruin the rest of the game for me. 
---
That said, I just got 25 headshots. I'm actually not as bad as I let on. Used to play a lot of competitive FPS, but those days are behind me. Still, once I completed that quest step, I switched weapons and got five in a row, including this annoying player that had been killing me for the entire time I was trying for precision shots. It felt like the old days, for a moment.

Yo i didn't know lol, I have no problem with gay people at all, but uhh memes? It's funny?

Damn bro it’s just something I didn’t know about. Calm down brother

I watch Baken for pvp goodness, i could care less about his toxicity

---
If it weren't for Cayde, I wouldn't care. Major character in the storyline, and saw how he got beat up facing off against overwhelming odds. I suppose I've always been kind of sentimental. 
---
All done, though. It was a pain but I'm not as bad as I thought. Still lost three rounds for my team doing it, but the moment I focused on getting kills it became much easier to drop players on the opposing team. I'll look into other hand cannons for PvE as well, tnx.

is there anywhere to get just forsaken? or is the annual pass a must

I’m about to start using it just to piss people off  XD

You mean all the caches? Think I'll go finish all that right now, so I can look at it in my inventory. All shiny and new.

From what I understand this is the only week to get this specific armor...
---
Noice.

I use the Destinythegame discord. Best suggestion is to watch a few raid guides so you aren't completely blind and look for groups with another new raider. I've been upfront with the person LFM and never been excluded from a raid for inexperience
---
 Correct. It does.
---
A week isn’t much time for the working man that pulls 60 hours a week plus a family. Don’t get a lot of tube time.
---
I'm curious to see how generous those bounties are. If you are able to earn enough to buy a piece or two a week I think that will be pretty fair considering all the free content.

It's called rift

Destiny lfg discord is by far the best place. Get a sherpa in minutes usually.

There will be a whole ten of you playing each life at once.

Aren’t those the colors of one Dredgen Yor? Or have I just put that idea in my head?

Unless the US is forcing people to eat the food, it’s not our fault, regardless of the fact that it would be the *companies* putting their restaurants in these countries.

That's a Dawning shader, funny enough one of my favourites. You have good choice in shaders, Guardian.

buuuuuum buuuuuum buuuuuum buum bum buuuuuuum buuuuuum

I ant really remember haha, I did really like the colours tho :)
---
How do i find the destiny lfg discord?
---
yay now i can wear caydes armor anywhere :D
---
I live in Northern VA and until recently our Walmarts sold firearms and ammunition. You just didn’t look hard enough.
---
Ok, so I am a little confused. 
---
I have a xbox character with gear that i love and is no longer obtainable. My Battle.net acct is much further progressed. Will I be able to play on my current PC acct now and then with the cross-save feature bring my Xbox gear over to that character? Or do i have to choose an account and play that account? Is there a way to play different characters from different systems? Like a PS4 Hunter, XBox Titan, and PC warlock?
---
Aw thank you very much, I have a hunter and a warlock aswell however I’ve not taken a picture of them yet :D
---
I dunno just Google it. If you can't find a link from that illl get you a link. Icon should be white with the destiny logo
---
I appreciate the help.
---
***Yare Yare Daze...***
---
Bruh, I would never get my meter up that high. I’m a fucking twig.
---
The dawning shader isn’t bad I put it in the vault for the new seasons gotta get it back out tho
---
We should cook up a PDX Clan! Think of it, raid teams starting automatically in the same time zone.
---
Thank you!
---
Appreciate it. Thanks.
---
Warlock’s have some of the best grenades in the game. 
---
It’s more that it’s just frustrating trying to get grenade final blows period.

Yeah, it’s good I really like it haha. :)
---
In pve titans stay in the action with their supers and all supers are viable. 
---
In pve locks pretty much use well of radiance in high level stuff so not much action and more support. 
---
If you want action all the time, no breaks, then go titan. If u want a bit more strategy in battle then go lock. They also have good mobility.
---
If this doesn't get at least a thousand upvotes I'm gonna burn reddit to the ground.
---
But I most go all out just this one
---
Damn you! 😂
---
This mission to unlock armor is a slog
---
Helmet is from the image of interpretation of Dredgen Yor, its the "Devastation Complex" heat one armor set for Titan. Chest plate is Crucible y1 and I don't know the rest.
---
Well I would understand in other activities. But it's menagerie... You get to the boss and can farm the chest no matter how long it takes or what you're using.
---
*halo theme plays*

They done vive me, i dont vive them

Except two days haven’t even passed. Chill.

Sounds like you need....two Titans.

Nah man. Is works because *is* is singular. The vex is a hive mind meaning it’s one single entity.

So Bungie needs to make every quest beatable within 24 hours because of you?

Transmogging for eververse is there because people want to wear the armor but not sacrifice stats they need from new armor. This applies to every armor set, say I like the Leviathan raid gear but those perks and stats don't really help at all in new content, then I apply the leviathan raid gear as a transmog so I can have the looks while keeping up the stats with my armor.
---
U really shouldn’t be emoting since I body shotted then missed... :(

And these countries giving them business licenses in their country..

They said before that by consolidating the options for crusible, a matchmaking required mode, that games are found wayyy faster.

Everyone knows it...)

I can feel the trumpets

I went to the room and unlocked the door on patrol, not sure if it was because I had it unlocked on other characters or not.

I never played D1 since I don't have any consoles, so all this is new new to me, and I'm super excited
---
I suspected that there was one for strikes but I had no idea about the CoS and menagerie ones. Thanks you letting me know!
---
I tried that, and it still didn't work.
---
Have you ever done the mission?
---
no I have not
---
yeah I've heard the same, but remember ps4 pro? "4K 120fps on ultra, we promise" and then barely can run games at 1080p 60fps.

Try and get it from Sloane if you haven't already completed titans quests.

It’s not you’re it’s your and remember you can’t just switch up armor since power level matters in iron banner. Nobody has the cores to infuse a grenade based armor set

Yeah it's *your mom's*

Then farm cores.. in the tangled shore you can buy one each day and you can dismantle legendary weapons from bounties.

Always when we r being invaded in gambit, instead of actually trying to kill the invader u decide NOW u wana revive me!? Then we both die from a rocket

Some good advice there.
---
Interestingly Alone as a God and Izanagi's Burden both have 45 zoom scopes. Funny how different scopes feel because of their look.
---
For primary go with either mountaintop or arbales and for the final battle go with outbreak (on heroic) 
---
For secondary I use recluse and 3 pulse rifles. 1 for every element. 1 is the one shaxx sold. The other is outlast (gambit prime) and finally I pulled from collections an arc one. Either way having 3 pulse rifles of each element comes really handy for the final fight.
---
Do not use the exotic auto rifle that changes elemnts bc it sucks and doesnt even do decent damage. Stick to pulse rifle elementals
---
Countdown is easily my favorite mode because it's so similar to Counter Strike.

I have 4 runs 4 opened chests and 2 1k drops 😂 1 on the first run i was so happy

Shoulder charge should be an area of effect explosion with longer range where you hold Down the button for up to like 3-4 seconds with a speed boost. but you get damage resistance during like that one exotic but no one shoting, shotguns are autistic enough, at least it make it a cool ability.
---
Void: damage resistance 30%~ and head is hidden behind shield so only shot from legs in front but normal everything else with resistance And suppress target in cone in front of you.
---
Solar: bigger final explosion and it’s basically like a rien ult from over watch but it’s like half a non directional jump at impactwith no stun and actually scrap it it’s like a mid tree arc melee, has more range but cone on floor with medium size hammer not giant one.
---
Arc: you cannot stop it like the other ones unless you hit someone and 1 second after and it lasts for 6 instead of 3/4, how it works is you hit someone for the about half health but they get knocked away like a car hit them and they are shocked until you finish(at the earliest a second after hitting one person) but even after it lasts 0.25 or 0.5 seconds longer so they can turn around faster, so encourages team play(being shocked means no reloading, switching weapons, or basically anything that makes you move a lot[shooting okay] and your sensitivity is at like 20%).
---
I don’t only hear one thing from this image.

Yeah lemme just run past my dead teammate and blow up that one Goblin with my Fighting Lion because I have a boner for Wendigo

At that speed he’s not using the shotgun, he’s just chucking rocks at you. It has the same result.

Havent heard from fenchirch recently, he must have found something
---
Bruh this meme was so ass
---
I was actually thinking about that earlier today. I would love a Kill Clip mod that increases its duration by 1.5 seconds like Rampage.
---
What I do is equip a single rune for a slot I wouldn't mind an item from(power weapon in my case) and just farm it over and over. I don't always get the MG, but by using only a single rune I always get it back using the perk from the chalice, plus I get other stuff to break down for cores/shards
---
I usually get ~1000 imperials per farm run at the end(my luck sucks, have a clanmate who regularly gets 3-5 k at the end). Seems to me to be the most effective but if anyone has better advice, I would like to hear it
---
It be like that sometimes.
---
Me when I shoot roaming supers with LoW: muda muda muda MUDA MUDA
---
Happened to me as well but the post game screen said we won and I got my winstreak so theres that
---
After the initial powerful rewards, everything else will be under your power. Is it worth farming gear anyway? Yes, however if mostly go for weapons to get the rolls you want. Decent farm for Imperials? Anything that is fast.. Put on the 4 hour consumable from Werner/Benedict and go farm Strikes/Crucible/Gambit. The "fastest" farm may just be the chest at the end of Menagerie until they fix it (unless it is intended to work the way it does?). Aside from the Chests on the Barge, most activities reward 500 Imperials. Don't forget about your Triumphs! Those are 500 a piece as well. (the Chests on the Barge cost a total of 90k Glimmer for 2700 Imperials whenever they reset)

Tbh. Most people don't need that. And the up tick in the people asking the same question and the every other post of "new player here, where do I start, how to x the fastest way possible and which raid should I do first?" The mega thread probably wouldn't reduce it by that much. Most of those posts are there because people don't search first, they just post. 
---
Might stave a few come September, but I don't think by much.
---
Dear Lord.
---
Yeah I agree. On a completely different note, is it worth MW armor? I never do it, not sure how much difference it even makes
---
Thank you so much! :D
---
Ngl I love both Warmind and Forsaken, the Destiny series in general just has such fucking incredible music
---
And you can cheese the chest for like 5 rolls on whatever your farming for at the end, and that's if you don't have the chalice perk for extra non-powerful drops. You'd have to be crazy to complain about Nicki Menagerie's rewards/difficulty.
---
I'll add you when I get off work today. I plan on doing scourge &amp; last wish this weekend. We'll find some people.
---
Might be true, but atleast we can then just direct them there once they ask. Its to make it easier on everyone else as well not just them. Im kinda getting tired explaining those things 😅
---
AFAIK the best time and place to farm the kills is iron banner. People are a lot less sweaty and you still get the bonus you'd get in competitive without ruining your glory in the process.
---
I ground out my resets for the title and haven’t set foot back in gambit can’t stand it
---
Thats why you need to teach them
---
Awesome!

How’d you get it?

beating the Gahlran encounter in the Crown of Sorrow raid.
---
Well there are comprehensive guides and videos that explain everything. If you search one up real quick maybe just link that one. I just know that mega thread wouldn't be viewed by 80% of the sub.
---
I said shut
---
It has higher chances of being found the. All the other sources and we can just redirect them to it if they ask something , or even better, the moderators can set a rule where any such threads cannot be created and points them to it themselves.
---
“sure our bodies are strong, but our friendship is even stronger”

Well the city is a public space. How's your Nat/connection? Maybe you are restricted and it's causing you to not be able to match correctly with others in the Tower.

See how stupid that is.

During week one of the new raid this guy i beat it with said that he had the taken blight notification on his screen the entire raid.

Depends on class. I’m a Warlock and decided to stain myself by using nova warp just for the hand held super nova. I went from 7% to 23% in one game. Found my remedy for the gong show.
---
i’d rather not end it all
---
Everybody talks about how PvE players ruin PvP grind in terms of nerfing Luna’s and making this sniper not a fabled thing, what people forget is how hard PvP also brings down PvE, the reason a game like borderlands has infinite ammo guns, guns that shoot nukes, and other crazy things is because they don’t need to balance for PvP, however bungie still adds these crazy weapons like wardcliff and jotuun which is awesome, but it comes at a cost of people complaining about them in PvP, same with supers, so idk a solution
---
But in the show they’re shooting grievous and Miss a lot
---
I like to give them a little dance on their ghost while they’re dead just to kick them while they’re down
---
How many loot clears have you done?
---
The main reason people want Swarm though is because it's void, and therefore has the best dps when combined with Tractor Cannon.
---
youtube it like everyone else did.  lol
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
took me a fucking year to figure the taken one out.  haha.  finally ACCIDENTALLY came across a youtube video that showed them all and i was like "dang, im stupid!".  then i finally contributed to the event.  lol
---
Thanks. I hate it.
---
The quest is currently known and recognized by bungie for being bugged atm, so you can't complete it unfortunately.
---
Eh I still hear it in Dinklebot.
---
It's a known issue that will be fixed in a future update.
---
The fact that she hasn't even appeared in the slightest makes me not hyped at all. If you wanna hype a big enemy up, do it like mass effect did with the reapers, that was a way better and interesting way to show your big bads.
---
No he just deflects evrrything
---
I prefer it over any 180 I have, and I am on console.
---
That's just a bullshit lie, maybe on PC you can touch people at 20m but even with release on console it's been two bursts even within 20m to kill supers. Wah supers are ruining crucible, wah the only great counter to supers is ruining crucible... This community ruined crucible... 
---
As a less toxic note, 20m is close... Just ya know shoot them first beyond that range it's really not that hard
---
When you're the only one in 4 guardians that shoots at the thresher......
---
I want to farm weapons in IB and not get armor drops, but have already completed and turned in the first part of the quest. Will I still only get weapons or is it too late?
---
Ok
---
It’s my third day
---
It's good to watch how high level players do it while you're in the event with them. That's how I learned just about everything I know in the game, by imitating someone with a higher power level.
---
&gt;Nicki Menagerie
---
That was AMAZING
---
Step into the bubbles to obtain the buff. It last about 5 seconds. Step out of the bubble while buffed and you can damage the big black ball in the sky. Do enough damage and you will trigger the heroic. 
---
Most people don’t get this one and try to shoot the bubbles instead of the black ball. This behavior is falsely reinforced when someone else’s causes the event to go heroic and the clueless blueberry thinks it caused the heroic by shooting the bubbles and continued with this behavior, not knowing it doesn’t work that way.
---
Because we like Titans.
---
2 was jus my opinion, like I said use anny sniper you fancy. I just pointed out what worked for me but encouraged ppl finding what sniper they like. I used to be a console player but swapped over to PC. my grind sheet still should be useful to console gamers. Not sure what the console pvp is like now and what weapons are dominant but I don't think snipers don't play a good role on console, not sure don't quote me on that. Use my I. Think this method. Do your kills in rumble and get glory separate. Gl :)
---
Got Cerberus + 1 last week and did this exact thing. Those poor Fallen
---
Now thats some teleporting right there.
---
Need a wallpaper version. Nessus is my favorite planet since Y1 :D
---
One thing to add to that, is right now players that have the base game have access to CoO and Warmind.
---
Guardians be like... Wahhh supers are ruining crucible
---
Also guardians... Wahhh the only good super counter is OP because its max kill range is still far less than most hand cannons or pulses or snipers or scouts or idk a lot of guns
---
The random blue dots on your minimap. Usually used as a derogatory term towards a player that doesn’t really get it.
---
Possibly, my thought would have been the age of triumph towards the end of the season
---
Sure lol.... I just don't see it .... I'm beating lord of wolves with wishbringer so.....
---
It’s literally called binary pheonix menagerie gear, I think it’s a safe bet it comes from the menagerie
---
Jeez louise
---
I was in a game where there was a 4-stack of snipers vs a 3-stack of LoWs, with the randos swapping sides every few rounds. I think I averaged a 0.37k/d
---
If you have the base game right now, you can access the CoO and Warmind (first 2 DLCs). In September you'll get some limited access to Forsaken patrol zones, but not the Forsaken Campaign or Raid.
---
More details in the FAQ at the top of this sub, and the Shadowkeep FAQ stickied to the front page.
---
Bro it was like 3:00 in the morning i just shut off my xbox after that
---
Don't worry, even if you have friends, it's still unreasonably hard to get people to raid with.
---
You might want to try getting 5 fresh players together and getting into guided games?
---
Please nerf.
---
Fine, no need to be condescending
---
The dlcs are amazing and without them there isn’t much to do :/
---
Especially if the chicken shits panic super you
---
These pinnacle quests kinda ruin crucible. Nothing worse than a team sniping and getting Grenade kills for a pinnacle weapon. But I got all pinnacle weapons so I’m part of the problem to lol
---
If you enjoy the game then the DLC will just make it even better. However be aware that getting the season pass will also give you access to the seasons prior to current - but that content isn’t as played as Season of opulence. 
---
Still the content is great - I bought the game with gold from wow, it was nice but when forsaken came out that’s when shit got fun
---
Destiny PvP is laughably bad
---
Divide and conquer, the biggest weapon you have against a six stack is their mind set and mentality. Sometimes one good play throws them all off and the ones who generally carry better have real strong backs
---
What about people who know how to make public events heroic but don't because they don't want to take the time to do the event properly?
---
The use of so much year 1 armor in the trailer/livestream really seems to hint that this armor may be updated in the future, but as of right now that has not been confirmed.
---
Is it possible to learn this power ?
---
Agreed, as someone who bought a PS4 just to play No Man's Sky ( everything else I play on Xbox ) I had a blast playing it and at first glance I thought this was a NMS post!
---
As a titan main I can agree. 
---
That is one hundred percent another titan.
---
You work wonders.
---
I had the invitation because my other character was eligible and that thing is account wide. I did not know at the time that my other character that met the 690 requirement also had to complete Forsaken (the invitation had the Menagerie step and did not say anything about Forsaken).
---
Not from the Vanguard
---
I don't get it.  Bungie is an angry cat?
---
While I'd still farm it, it won't be a part of the eververse changes. It will, however, become a viable set of armor that is on the same level as all of the other sets, so if you like the way it looks, then it will still be viable.
---
Warlock died holding his rift, must not main Warlock.
---
Destiny 2 is the last destiny bungie wants

It's a wierd glitch with the hit detection when two people lunge. Fucks titans really badly.
---
Release the wolves
---
Do the quest lines for the other areas (mercury, mars, tangled shore).  Look for activities that give 'powerful gear' and do those (typically weekly activities).
---
People that say you HAVE to have swarm are just bad, and don’t actually realize how easy the boss is to 1 phase. Anarchy+mountaintop does more damage if you don’t have someone on tractor cannon. Also mountaintop can be replaced by a decent militias birthright (pretty much anything with spike nades)
---
this is what happens when 2 groups of 5 and a group of 2 join the same game lol

---
Yes, I know, just wanted to explain why Swarm of the Raven is so popular right now, I've read the statistics. But thank you for clarifying, should've said that in my earlier Post. I'm going to use Wendigo anyway as I can't get a good Swarm of the Raven (RIP 2000 Iron Banner Tokens).
---
Nomads?
---
Would be more fitting for a Titan.
---
How do you get the gem on your shoulder

Not gonna lie, that's what I end up doing 9/10 anyways, haven't found a problem that can't be solved by punching yet.

Mostly the use of flat colours and simple shapes.

If you google "Art Deco Posters" you'll see some of the influences to the style.
---
Ya know, like we wouldn't have a home or headquarters... To be just wandering... Of course we were always going to still be at some kind of iteration of the tower
---
We are at this point in the story, we've just moved on from the farm so we are technically nomads.
---
Except I’m pretty sure the way things work is not by coding individual weapons, but rather classes of weapons. Tweaking one thing in the sandbox affects a bunch of other things, and sometimes it’s unpredictable. It’s a way harder environment to troubleshoot because you have to make sure you’re not breaking 10 things when you try to fix 1.
---
Solid reasoning. I hope so
---
Except, you do still have to time things. And it's not a permanent duration. The duration goes quicker unlike Titan blocking. Seriously this is coming from a dood who use all three classes.  (Granted I will disclose that I raid hunter but that's cause I just play what my clan doesn't have, which no one else wants to be a hunter) That super needs help in my opinion. Not nerfed. It's so easy to counter. It's like playing overwatch and Zarya, just don't shoot her damn bubble and it's fine. I realize maining a Titan puts you into hulk mentality of "got to smash" but all you need is self control. 
---
I literally just played a IB match where one was deflecting and running at me. I just kept backing up cause they move slower when they use it. He stopped and all I had to do was shove a Chaperone in his face and he died. Imo that class is useless cause all you have to do is just not shoot at it. All arcstrider is kinda still lacking, why I barely ever see them except for arc week. The Titan boots I use on the other hand all you need to do is be running. Works everytime when you shoulder charge someone into Oblivion. Or slide and deflect their weak ass knives/novabomb right back in their face.
---
Well, we can’t block that. 
---
But I have slammed slam titans with my big electric stick...which feels good all over
---
Yup, total shame.
---
Nah titans are pretty balanced unlike a certain blade BARRAGE
---
Chills and made my eyes water
---
...it's not that hard lol. That being said, I'm an arc web warlock XD
---
Yeah raids and night strikes are meant to be hard. That's fine. Letting players into the Dreaming City just to get rekt so hard is not fine. If they at least raised the light level requirements then that would be fair since I would know I am going into something I should not be trying with my current light.
---
Warlock jump is an art
---
Do you play gambit often? Some months ago, they made the meatball primeval spawn equally as often as every other primeval. All you have to do to get the seething heart is defeat the meatball.
---
Yeah they said it was going, was in the season of opulence patch notes
---
Dont be fooled though I'm lucky to get a kill in crucible lol
---
Its the new Menagerie armor for the Titan
---
Yes sir!
---
Go into rumble and farm bots
---
It was clearly stated in the patch notes for this season that those packages were retired. It was intended to be a bonus during that season only. It was never meant to be a permanent bonus that you get.
---
But I don't know how to get them off of the xbox (other than screenshotting it off of the xbox app, I'm on mobile)
---
I would be happy with it if they just made it a 90 rpm and gave it better handling. My only complaint is the handling. Feels sluggish w/o a sprint grip mod.
---
First, wrong sub. Read the rules. 
---
Second, if you are going to go out looking for a clan, might want to list a platform. Thats kind of an important detail.
---
So true and disappointing
---
This was happening in my prime games (and the one strike i ran) a lot this morning.
---
Motes underground. Enemies underground. The strike legit had a room where the floor didn't load. Was taking fire, slide through a doorway to take cover, fell for a solid 20 seconds before dying.
---
My b I didnt know there was a clan sub what’s the r/ ?
---
One thing that contributes to it feeling better is the higher frame rate not just Fov.
---
Uh where is that
---
Someone got super pissed at me yesterday in menagerie all because I typed in the chat “I’ll run well”. Got more funny when the other players jumped in telling him to chill.
---
Yeah I just rolled over 500 which is the minimum and it feels like I can't do shit there lol
---
Nice idea concept but that's too pinnacle for a pinnacle weapon so they made us grind beloved lol
---
Not really.  It's okay for body shots, but it's precision damage is pretty bad compared to any other precision heavy.  Darci does nearly double the DPS on headshots.
---
Ape away my dude
---
A smaller hit box would be cool but personally I already find it hard to shoot a hunter while dodging. What I’m taking about is taking away the auto lock for melee when you are dodging.
---
Really? I normally infuse for the power bump.
---
The colony and play of the game. I got mine exclusively off heavy ammo. If you do colony play defensively and if its potg, play aggressively. Mine had an icarus grip on it and I would just jump in the air for a second and shoot at the opponents feet. The colony I would not go out in the open with and would also not go looking for a 1v1 with. Mainly because I wanted to conserve ammo to get calculated medals and to do that I would try to fire one bullet at whatever guy my teammates are getting into it with across the map.  Fighting lion, the maul and birthright I had no luck whatsoever getting multiple kills with despite always having ammo.
---
When you die to an enemy that is over your power level, it will say the enemy's power level in the top right corner of the death screen. I know you say you "meet the requirements," but I am saying you do not. 
---
Bear in mind, if you die from a combination of self and enemy damage, the death screen may list your own power level as the enemy's, but this is kind of a rare bug.
---
/r/Fireteams and /r/DestinyLFG are 2 subs for this type of stuff.
---
Ah. I’m just desperate for enhancement cores, and I never really read too much into those. Thanks
---
Thing I’m most salty about is that I don’t have it. Lol
---
Appreciate it
---
Id go for wendigo- for the most part, id say its safe from future nerfs as it is primarily a pve weapon (although you cant put anything passed bungie). Lol. Very strong, unique, and can really help out the fireteam by having it
---
Please use the LFG megathread linked at the top of this subreddit. It has a variety of links to other places, as well as comments where people recruit for their clans. This post has been removed, as we try to keep this subreddit relatively clear of LFG requests.
---
Huge fan of this meme.
---
Endgame location it’s supposed to be tough, understand it’s frustrating but if you talk to Benedict 99-40 in the tower he should have a power boost quest for you
---
I get the meatball spawned in Gambit matches so much I hate it
---
Each one has a different goal you have to achieve.

6 stacks doesnt mean sweaty. Could just be a group of friends playing together
---
Its not something that is easy to do. Making a wider frame on screen takes more resources to render and that ramps up significantly the higher the slider goes.
---
Consoles have a very specific amount of power they can output and most games optimize so that they use most of the power much of the time. 
---
Many games don't have free overhead to just add a feature like this. Unlike the division, you have a lot more going on in the open world with a lot more special effects and things. 
---
Its not something that I picture will happen until the next generation of consoles.
---
Wendigo does more DPS without perk than Sleeper does with a headshot.  Imagine if it was an Aggressive frame.
---
Are you doing Gunsmith bounties? You can get 60-70 cores a week if you are doing his bounties on all 3 characters every day.
---
You shouldnt rely on your playerbase cheating.
---
Play gambit during full curse weeks. Best chance to get it.
---
that jacket looks a little out of place, you gotta swap in to the pretty gear when you take screenshots
---
Reminds me of Journey, awesome stuff ma dude
---
This isn't an LFG sub.
---
Rule 14.
---
/r/Fireteams
---
Thanks. Did not know that!
---
Need a captain class stat
---
Last season there was a triumph from Iron Banner to quit your job and alienate everyone who loved you to grind for the Wizened Rebuke. I decided it wasn't worth the hassle. First thing I get this week from cashing in some tokens? Wizened Rebuke.
---
I think they are just the old ornaments from year one
---
We need playable fallen at some point 
---
Four arms would be cool
---
Hunter and titan mix. Super aggressive glasscannon.
---
Fus ro dah!
---
It's not in the game right now at all, if that's what you mean. They did say they one day hope to add it back in in a reworked state, but that this is not happening any time soon.
---
There are no new ones. You can just use the old ones if you have them. 
---
There are none that you can earn this season.
---
Wait. 
---
I already play as I titan but I use basically anything i can to make me a hunter 
---
I'm the captain now
---
What?
---
Lol
---
Yes, random exotic drops. Also I am 99% sure they are available in "Fated Engrams" from Xur.
---
You forgot cayde...oh wait
---
The things from Art Deco that inspired this work was mainly the flat colours.  
---
I remember seeing some posters people had made for cities and various places in the real world and they were all claimed as "Art Deco," one big one of note was one for a forest, and the trees looked quite similar to what I have created.  
---
Thanks for the feedback, though! - Art Movements are still very much a topic I'm new-ish to, so I'm prone to making some errors!
---
That's interesting thanks. I would prefer to "earn" those weapons but good to know that they're not unreachable
---
Yup same here at least I got out before the bows started flooding gambit for the hush
---
You Uno Reversed that Phalanx’s shield bash.
---
Yup. It's in the exotic pool. Same for Arbalest :)
---
I can’t tell if this is a sbubby or a long ass moons haunted joke
---
Titan to Cabal:  Here take my tractor cannon hit, you scrub!
---
yea its on IO
---
"Yeah, I detected that too."
---
Not all of course, but I see a lot of salty posts on places
---
No, it's just the Deathstar from star wars.
---
Aztecross liked this meme on my Twitter and I’m happy. Idc how many times I get shoulder charged today.
---
Full counter!
---
Join an active clan that you look forward to grouping up with and chatting with every day. If your clan is silent or inactive, leave it. I had the same problem where I was very into Destiny 2 for months, and sort of fell out after Forsaken came out, and recently got back into it hardcore. I felt overwhelmed by how much others were playing, how much higher their light was than mine and how easily they were doing stuff like raids.
---
I know it's hard but, don't think like this. There are ALWAYS going to be players better than you, wearing gear you want, and using weapons and exotics you wish you had. It's not a contest, or shouldn't be. I got back into Destiny 2 recently by remembering all the amazing times I had with my clan, all the laughs we shared, and how I truly got to know them as friends. It's kind of corny, but true. In my opinion, this game is only as good as the people you play it with. It's easy to get bored if you're always playing solo or playing with randoms who aren't chatting in a party.
---
My suggestions:
---
* join an active clan--&gt; one that uses Discord, has over 100 members, and is clearly full of likeminded people (see descriptions before joining one)
---
* if you're shy, open up a little and make friends in your clan (just be yourself!)
---
* always have a goal you're working towards 
---
* don't obsess over gear and light level, just have fun
---
* If you're always doing the same thing, try something different. I got into raiding (and you could call me a scrub haha) and realized it's some of the best content the game has to offer. You don't have to be a certain 1% of person to raid in this game, it just takes practice. If you never do PVP, try more Crucible and Iron Banner, etc. 
---
* Download the destiny 2 companion app (iphone/android) and look for activities to do with others. Yes some are very tryhard and say KNOW WHAT TO DO but you'll always find some that are teaching (talking raids here) or accepting lower light players. 
---
Try these things and your light level will climb without you obsessing over it so much. You'll look forward to logging on for reasons besides just MUST REACH MAX LEVEL.
---
Is it a recluse or a golden gun
---
What does it shoot 
---
Can I punch it?
---
Handheld supernova thank me later

Add shaggy to destiny

Oh, I don’t but ok!
