Bungie knows what‚Äôs up
---
---
---
I'm not a big handcannon user, but the two that I actually like and use are Malfeasance from Gambit, and Midnight Coup from Leviathan. 
---
Its 2 kills per 1%
---
Blame the Flash.

I laughed way to hard at this comment. Take my up vote.

I forgotten about Duke thanks.  
---
the fucking comments on the tweet

Alright alright alright, I get you're not a fan, hotshot. Lemme just tell ya, don't look outside your house cause...

---
VEX CABAL HIVE AND FALLEN ON THE FRONT YARD! 
---
Better grab a sword.
---
(END DRIFTER THREAT)
---
Lmao yeah
---
I honestly doubt you can't get it anymore considering I finished one of the triumphs for it last night.
---
Make sure you're playing regular gambit and not Prime. 
---
There‚Äôs your problem right there. You‚Äôre calling this DLC. It‚Äôs not. This is not an expansion. It‚Äôs smaller content updates that add a variety of different things to earn and chase along with a few extras like cutscenes here and there and a quest or two plus more.
---
I think the annual pass so far has been successful for what it is. It‚Äôs 40 dollars for 3/4‚Äôs of a year worth of seasonal content updates. I would MUCH rather have this system than have what we‚Äôve had in the past. TTK launched and we didn‚Äôt get an update until mother fucking April. And that update wasn‚Äôt even as big as these that we are getting now. Would it be awesome to get substantial DLC expansions about as often as we are getting these seasonal updates? Sure, maybe. But that‚Äôs just not feasible.
---
The people at Bungie work hard to make the best game for the best community of people. That being said they are still just humans working at their jobs. Better not super humans that can bust out DLCS every 3 months. I really think we‚Äôve gotten on a very good track as far as delivering satisfying content that comes often enough to keep the game from becoming too dry and empty. I‚Äôm not sure exactly what your deal is with the annual pass but the fact that you just simply say it all sucks shows me that you are just a ignorant and naive simpleton. There‚Äôs definitely decent content within the annual pass and like I said before I think Bungie has at least found the foundation of what could be a great system for keeping this game interesting and ever expanding at a rate that keeps people happy and engaged.
---
Now I‚Äôm not fan-boying, I just think it‚Äôs incredibly dumb and petty to say ‚Äúthe dlc sucks‚Äù. If you don‚Äôt like it then that‚Äôs fine, you don‚Äôt have to. But the content definitely doesn‚Äôt suck and the system or way that we are getting these updates is definitely an improvement or step in the right direction. Maybe I‚Äôm in the minority. But I like to believe I‚Äôm not and that people are generally pleased with the annual pass so far.
---
How did you get it?
---
Midnight coup suits every environment. 
---
Lolololol this guys talking shit so he can befriend you to play destiny 2 with him. How very sad lol. Like I said you‚Äôre only going to get attention from lonely ass reddit dwellers. The same people who are also looking for attention
---
Don't try this at home.
---
Duke 44. Outlaw rampage reserves mod. 
---
Mine had 13 in the hole and after 3 hs kills becomes a monster for the next 10. 
---
Caveat no one uses primaries for boss dps. Ok?  ;). 
---
Hopefully 
---
Thanks for clarifying, and have a nice day/night :D
---
It‚Äôs not comparable in the sense that with forsaken, destiny 2 becomes an entirely new experience 100x greater than base d2. The dreaming city and exotics are worth it alone in my opinion!
---
I'm gonna go ahead and side with Horsedick.MPEG
---
Look at badass over here who never misses a shot, eh?
---
A L A B A M A 1 0 0

Bungie has acknowledged that many things that should tick for any gambit game are not for prime. When they will fix it tho is another question...
---
That‚Äôs nothing 
---
Hey it‚Äôs Darryl from the office !
---
I think it‚Äôs 13 reason why but I‚Äôve never watched it so I‚Äôm not 100%
---
I feel like this is a hunters from bloodborne type of situation.
---
Maybe next 
---
Which side should I choose because I really don‚Äôt want to betray either side
---
Maybe next year
---
The first part is true and what makes this so difficult. As a believer in Yin and Yang, Ulan-Tan and the balance between good/light and evil/dark, I'm highly tempted to join the Drifter, plus the idea of our guardian being able to wield both the light and the dark is exciting, but I'm worried that it might be the wrong path.
---
This is further compounded by your second point. In the lore it has been known that the Driftrr has killed fellow guardians before, and not just any fellow guardians, but members of his own fireteam. Ikora though, in a general sense and based off of what I wrote in my post, what twith our relationship with her, would probably march into the depths of hell with and and probably for us.
---
How spicy is it tho
---
wait u can do that???

And you‚Äôre complaining?! For Most of us, Exotics don‚Äôt even drop, kid. 
---
I‚Äôve gotten the Malfeasance quest but haven‚Äôt done Dredgen, some of his voice lines seem to be talking to me as if I were a Dredgen. Or maybe that‚Äôs just how GP works
---
Ill tell you the biggest flaw. When you kill the 3rd envoy and the font of light appears, an invader comes. You are expected to stand in an open spot, DPS boss, while the invader with OP weapons (1K Voices, Wardcliff, Two-Tailed) can easily group kill you. With Randos, this is near impossible. 
---
XD git gud m8
---
Hahaha. Catch of the day! 
---
My games have gone pretty fast. can imagine with the upgrades to armour and perks it will be wildly different
---
My post is asking if someone has tried it
---
IS THIS SOME KINDA RICH JOKE I TOO PEASANT TO UNDERSTAND? 
---
"You're a hoonter are ya?"
---
__d__iN*g*
---
If they're in front of you already dropped then go for it, the problem is when they keep killing to try to grab more 
---
If I need just one to send a blocker then ima do that
---
This is a bug. According to the list of known bugs on the Bungie website, there will be a fix coming on Sunday. 
---
I do on my secondary character
---
Lol I‚Äôve noticed him get pretty aggressive in Gambit Prime, I love it
---
Petition for a new voice actor for Zavala? 
---
This comment makes me beyond happy. 
---
I am finding it more fun as I adjust to the mode. But it does seem like there are too many invasions 
---
It is probably never going to be a great mode for solos... Gambit comp really. Of course regulate Gambit isn't great for solos but I doubt I will ever be in the 60ies for win percentage I'm prime as a solo 
---
What's your system?
---
Oh okay. Well thanks a ton for letting me know
---
HA Yes!
---
does yours show progression too?
---
My mate got it on his 3rd ever completion yesterday, we didn't even do the full raid just 2 keys and a Queenswalk. Was happy he got it, as I've only done the LW like 4 times now. He got sleeper catalyst and the emote on his first ever SOS run too, rngsus is with him currently.
---
I don't know why but I find the ding so hilarious
---
What scout rifle is that on damn I'm gonna farm the crap out of it

This is what I shall use from now on to remember which one does what.

my friend got TWO of these yesterday on his warlock

I hate that perk 
---
Laughs in ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt have jotun.‚Äù
---
Melee kills and regular kills gives the weapon increased damage 
---
I've heard it's for doing top tier feats within a certain role
---
So getting an army of one while invading, killing a high value target, depositing 15 motes, and killing invaders
---
I think it's the picture that was here a few days ago with Zavala choking him.
---
No no. No no no no, oh and did I mention NO?!
---
We do absolutely everything Destiny has to offer. We have raids scheduled for weekends typically but anyone can create their own event that can be signed up for in our Discord (which is how we communicate)
---
We're all a bunch of players who pretty much exclusively play Destiny
---
Hey I didn't know that picking up more motes don't make a difference until I read an advanced guide for gambit on Reddit. I.e. 90%+ of people won't know
---
Stay strong. You‚Äôll get it. I didn‚Äôt get it until 2 weeks ago  after doing every gold frame at the big forge on all 3 chars. Got 3 since. Also got le monarque the very next match from gofannon. 
---
Sorry to everyone in this thread I wasn‚Äôt even trying to be a dick just saying Jotunn for me as bee amazing in both prime and reckoning

Uncle Drifty gave me a Triple Tap / Kill Clip Hazard and a Opening Shot / Rapid Hit Trust, so he got my eternal gratitude.

Why don‚Äôt you just stop being salty..... it‚Äôs a new game mode

New animation is pretty sick
---
No, sorry. The way I phrased that was bad. Thorn questline is completely seperate. It's just happening on the same day.

Alright alright alright, it's a little bit for the fashion. Different color crowns or being able to apply shaders to them would be a-mei-zing! Oh shit wrong game.

Probably for season 7

Could also be different apps 
---
Thanks, now I‚Äôll never NOT see a turtle!

I think he‚Äôs been through a lot, let him rant. Anyways if possible try to queue with a friend or a stack, it makes the game mode more bearable

I'll go with Drifter cause,

They really need to remove glass, I would take anything other than glass.that modifier sucks 
---
But these are complaints people have about players in the original Gambit. Clearly nothing has changed and this is frustrating.
---
Why can't people learn?
---
If you play regular gambit he now gives a line of instruction to kill the envoy first, then when you kill the envoy he says to kill the prime evil. 
---
Only three month late but every game I played today the teams seemed to pick up on it and the games were actually more competitive. IMO of course.
---
They always are around that age. Dumb. 
---
if its such a problem then find s team to go in with instead of complaining you arent matched with the perfect team that suits your wants
---
Yeah. At least you‚Äôre on the good end of the glitch. I‚Äôve been grinding for 2 months and haven‚Äôt had a single exotic drop at all. 
---
What's common sense?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Apologist here for life and technical issues
---
There's no dupe protection. I have 2 sentry legs and 2 invader chests. 
---
You're also going to need a fuck ton once the final gear tier comes out to farm good rolls on the set you want. 
---
What are you trying to say? 
---
Your team mates may be trying to do the malfeasance quest or bounties so they are playing to complete those and not to win. 
---
I play Solo and I don‚Äôt see a reason to get upset if my group doesn‚Äôt perform well. If it did I‚Äôd LFG to win and not complain on reddit. 
---
And go through all the campaigns (main and dlc), unlocking the dreaming city, unlocking all the forges. Again. Yeah...no.
---
God damn it. I hate that place so much. 
---
Rooooosa. Rosa Rosa Rooooosa
---
Yo i think this is the first gameplay of this gun posted onto youtube. Great video!
---
What‚Äôs the name?
---
I want that ship...
---
in any case, you're going to have 4 chances at this week's armor set and you only need 3 pieces to reap the benefits. there doesn't seem to be any point to grind for the full set this week though, as you said in your previous comment.
---
When the perk is active on the gauntlets your arcstrider punch becomes a stab with the blade
---
Taking a break from division2 haha didn't that game just come out?
---
You OBVIOUSLY know what I‚Äôm talking about.
---
Yes
---
Ya'll needs to be reading your lore drops.
---
I'm not
---
I wondered why I got a medal for banking three motes this morning
---
Nine nine!
---
Whaaaaaaat? Learn something new everyday. 
---
I think it‚Äôs the spawn.  So far I‚Äôve been killed 3 times before the the sound that announces an invader has arrived finish ringing.  I also think that sound is actually my shield resilience draining off of me.  Two of those times I just went poof...I‚Äôm dead.  I also suck but that‚Äôs a whole other story.
---
Dude I wouldn't fear that, either get the content or dont.  If you love to play it will be worth it.
---
Not impossible no, I mean look at Halo 3 and Reach, those games were awesome even at launch. It is possible to happen yea, but it seems they've become a bit more sloppy when it comes to certain stuff, such as community feedback mainly, they look in a dark ditch rather than the light of day sometimes. Even when it is right in front of them, they still do make crappy mistakes which affect the community's respect for Bungie. 
---
Have you done any upgrades since you started having problems a years ago? If not I'd do a ram check, biit from a Linux USB it even the windows utility.
---
I've found over the years weird stability problems not related to Windows can be caused by RAM
---
Heh, got it first one I played... now Bungie RNG hates me, I have one singular forsaken exotic
---
screebs. it means screebs
---
NOT ANYMORE BOI
---
situational now
---
Bet you were snickering like a little girl when you wrote this shit.  Hope you trip on your robe warlock.
---
or breakneck
---
just motes
---
Yes, but LMGs are also more consistant due to not having the long projectile time, more ammo, and overall more value as you can also use them for ad clear and melt. Even if you're able to consistantly land rockets, you face long reload times, the need to leave cover with nothing to flinch potential snipes, and the fact people can still round corners to get to safety.

Was I on your team earlier?!

I've started a few with only 2, and had the other 2 come in later. If you're not watching the radar they can be easy to miss.
---
Chattering bone
---
Well if 2 teammates have 15 motes and I can wipe an invader so they can bank then that‚Äôs the smart move, not lose 30 motes because my super belongs to you and should be used to clear motes.
---
Invasion kills are not the only thing, if I can pin a team for 30 seconds with no kills that‚Äôs 30 seconds boss is not under attack or it‚Äôs are not being gathered and collected
---
Shall I keep wrecking your hard fast rules? 
---
Yes.

That's me, i have all game volume turned off, but most times play with hubs and his volume is on.. but i also watch the bar for gambit and will go bank if i see its close

I don't know but if the synths stack they can more 20.
---
(Laughs in ad clearing)

You sound like you just want to clear ads unimpeded.. go play story missions ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I really hate that 1v4 argument. If I'm not allowed to have that kind of an advantage from an external source, no one should. It's only fair. Even if it's for 30 seconds, being able to be seen from ANYWHERE on the map is a serious disadvantage. 
---
*laughs in +3 invader*
---
2 raids, dreaming city, forges too?
---
Shaxx.
---
My bad I thought it was for regular crucible bounties. 
---
(Laughs over laughing in hammerhead)
---
How just random  or by putting in the motes
---
Nope. You can get distant relation now. It Sucks.
---
lmaoo
---
Was wondering the same thing. I'm betting that's a no to both raids.
---
as my powerful drop for the reckoning, completed the % needed
---
I got gwisin vest today from Gambit prime, I always knew there was a reason I liked the drifter
---
You will get it once the item is available, in most cases and to redeem it, there should be a redeem page within bungie.net
---
Can you still get it from a random drop in gambit?
---
Loud and clear
---
Nice ill try it
---
Let me fix that for you:
---
True, the Vanguard sucks
---
After all I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre talking about this guy https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY6Qy4qU-d13U42280CxIvA
---
Whatever side Shaxx is on cuz he‚Äôs my favorite character
---
Yup. Though I'm a fan of outlast now it fires faster and with rampage outlaw it's godly 
---
Stormcaller and dawnblade are both plenty viable as roaming supers and a nova bomb will shut down any other super you‚Äôre complaining about..
---
Try actually playing something other than warlock and you‚Äôll find that ursa and shards definitely don‚Äôt work as you‚Äôre describing
---
Do it! I am a little surprised I was able to get tier 2
---
No I dont spend any time on youtube
---
How do I get an Outlast?
---
*laughs in getting 4 kills with Polaris lance while the  primeval is is almost dead*
---
They added a minimum delay before casting jump. before you could use all your bursts at once and get that immediate momentum. Now it is staggered making you stay in the air longer. There is also a final burst that doesn't give you speed and slows you down. It would have been great if didn't add the minimum delay between jumps, but left the last burst so you would have to tap the jump key in beat in order to titan skate, but instead they totally killed it.
---
They should bring back the old system for infusion: 5 motes of light, 5 weapon parts/armor materials depending on if its an armor piece or weapon, and 5 legendary marks. Was a lot more convenient and planetary materials take too long to get unless you buy them from spider. 25 mats is too much. 
---
Random drop from gambit prime. Or the first engram you get after completing the gambit prime intro quest
---
(Laughs in laughter over laughing in outdated destiny before the nova warp nerf)
---
*laughs in good ol' d1 lance nova*
---
Who hurt you lil mama? You keep driving a nail into the sky. We can 1v1 anytime though. 
---
Old nova warp had many fundamental problems. While it definitely got overnerfed as it stood it was the strongest super in the game. Keep in mind the thing had an absurd duration, impressive range, high mobility, damage reduction like all non golden gun roaming supers, and hit through walls disregarding line of sight that literally every other super needs outside specific conditions. Old spectral with vest was broken because of the botched perk on gwinsim over refunding, recent striker was busted until they implemented diminishing returns.
---
As it stood the super was beyond all the other supers when no exotics were in play, and still beat out many of them like arcstaff even if it had raiden flux attached. Blade barrage got heavily nerfed into a state where the thing is virtually useless outside pvp and even in pvp got hit so hard with a nerf that everyone tends to choose buffed six shooter instead. Similarly to how nova warp got hit too hard and now dawnblade is the better option.
---
I don‚Äôt think returning either of these supers to pre nerf would solve any imbalance, however, this doesn‚Äôt mean there‚Äôs isn‚Äôt a way to balance the two so they don‚Äôt feel op but are still viable options in all situations. For NW this probably entails a bit more resistance and less energy use on warp but more damage and energy use on the pulse (the energy increase is to roughly balance out the fact it would take fewer pulses to kill heavier or super using targets compared to current which leads to less drain overall). Similarly for BB this probably necessitates a damage increase but keep gallanor in nerfed state, perhaps decrease tracking on knives a bit which would also help with them following targets behind walls for no reason and harmlessly blowing up a solid object, and otherwise retain current stats.
---
Not saying those are be all end all solutions or that they‚Äôre even viable options, but this is just the thoughts of a warlock hunter hybrid.
---
Like enhancement cores tbh are the problem i feel like if they took that outta the equation we wouldnt have an issue. But yeah D1 infusion was a lot easier tbh
---
yes
---
Check your inventory
---
(Laughs in trust and bygones)
---
All I know is that part of that report mentioned that all the hunters left the tower as soon as the others started wondering who would be the next Hunter vanguard would be. I'm just imaging my hunter hearing Ikora talk about needing a new vanguard and saying something like, "Oh sorry Ikora I'd love to talk but my cousin Petra called, gotta go live out groundhogs day, bye!
---
You are right, but i still don't consider it justified to ruin other people's fun, just because they saved me.
---
Same thing happened to me earlier this evening on pc!
---
If the Drifter is bringing Dark Guardians into the fold, then I‚Äôm gonna have to go with Drifter.
---
Doug? 
---
Getting killed by any super ruins fun really mayhem breaks friendships. And tether users have fun when they tether someone and tether is really underrated in pvp 
---
Sounds like a great problem
---
Shards is fun to play against, because you know you die, but when someone tethers your wandering super you pop a vein.
---
You can save yourself from a tether and in mayhem you earn it back quite fast. Losing one fight doesn't end the match.
---
Ha. Jokes on you. You can't do your 75th run again. It's gone forever.

It's probably the closest we will get for a long time

As a former 625 Guardian i want to thank every single one of the 640+ Guardians carrying me through the reckoning (didn't seem like they had a hard time, they melted that thing way before timeout) and getting me high level drops so i am at 640 now myself. Really, thank you! I hope that eases your anger, we are people too trying to play new stuff :/ And i am 643 now so i am trying my best to do my part
---
I'll play what I want how I want when I want to. So what if a better team wins?
---
Well the reason i did this post is because they just made this reckoning. They have 90% of the foundation in place, it would literally be adding waves/rewards. I dont ever see them brining escalation up to current power because of the lack of players/new rewards. It would only be for people who haven‚Äôt gotten all them old weapons yet.
---
&gt; deal with the idiot's
---
lol
---
The dps is the same, and the ammo economy is better, dont see how its a massacre
---
It's like a ghosty Deathtrap.
---
Yep, yesterday I managed to 100% the motes part and gained 0% on the wins despite having multiple.
---
I'll add you, I'm omarhcastro123
---
Propane and propane accessories I tell you hwat.
---
all you, sea* heh I'm lonely 
---
I'm going Invader myself. I wonder if dropping a Ward of Dawn on the enemy's bank to drain their motes is a good strategy. I'll need the last Invader perk for that though.
---
What I love about these posts is when it's the other way around OP thinks they are just amazing and the matchmaking is fine
---
Haven‚Äôt been on the game for a while. Any care to fill me up what‚Äôs going on?
---
old news. Though I‚Äôm curious as to what it‚Äôll be like. Assuming it‚Äôs similar to the likeness of Nokris, it‚Äôll just be the same models as the Echoes of Oryx we fought in D1 
---
I love sunshot but when arc singe is the modifier and the opponents are bringing in arc damage (fallen are big on arc) you can bet I'm going to repay them in a lightning storm of bullets to the face. Thunder is just the sound you hear after lightning has already struck... 
---
Got the new Outlast pulse rifle with feeding frenzy and kill clip after the first match. I instantly masterworked it

I honestly just want this post to get noticed so they fix the neck.

I am one of those geomag laser-warlocks who just take 60% boss HP in one laser at x3 buff. If I am respawning at x3 and hit the boss at x4 I can almost completely solo it with nade before lasering.

I do the same, using whisper to interrupt boss and taking down weak spots. But this nerf makes me having to use a extra sniper to do that, which also makes me loss a shotgun to use for berserkers. That whole fight feel so less fun now after the nerf. And it has nothing to do with me missing shots on boss, usually only loses shots if we don't 1 phase and i'm mid 3 burst. And if i wanna use a shotgun then i have to rely on others to interrupt once i'm down to 3 ammo left. (Don't get me started on how much harder this will be to 2-3man thx to this nerf, something i wanted to try this season since we don't get a new raid)
---
As a level 20, I recently just found myself with a bunch of enhancement core which I don't know what to do with. Also exclusive to level 20 life your stuck with the same shit for a few weeks. Even months. I would agree if I was at the lowest point of level 20 life but I'm not anymore and I find it really hard to agree with you guys even though in the past I definitely would.
---
Yall sitting their complaing about whisper but they made it so perfect paradox takes an eternity to pump and has no range! Its a fucking auto shotty why would they nerf its fire rate to be that of a pump shotgun
---
.....and fork
---
I think it's because people are trying for specific gear/motes, and sticking to those roles? I'm not sure.
---
Want that on my synthoceps Titan for sure..
---
Bygones with armour piercing rounds, rangefinder and outlaw is my boy
---
On a sidenote; Screw me for messing up the title. Oxygen obviously :/
---
There are 2 exotic quests, one for all D2 players and for annual pass owners.
---
What if the free one is for vanguardians and the annual pass one for drifters :p
---
It's actually really good in pvp just have to know how and when to use it
---
I think he gave good reason not to trust Rasputin. It's a super powerful self aware AI, so far its only helped us to help itself, it couldn't kill xol by itself and needed us to be boots on the ground, no telling what Rasputin will do now. Just because Anna has some "good feelings" towards Rasputin doesn't mean he can be trusted/controlled.
---
The uldren thing makes sense too, he just killed cayde, one of the strongest guardians and the strongest hunter. "I don't want to bury anymore friends". If he would of declared a full out war with uldren he would of possibly lost so much on a revenge mission. Not to mention that might mean a full scale war with the awoken as well. He's also probably got some bad ptsd/guilt from both the red war and cayde dying, the last thing he would want to do is go on the war path.

I think everything they've done has been to protect humanity, they lost so much in the red war, they're in no position to start reaching our and exerting pressure across the system. They seem to be more focused on repairing defenses and protecting what's left, complacency is what let the red legion take the tower and the traveler.
---
I see it as the vanguard is defense, and drifter is offense. The drifter wants to harness light and darkness as equal weapons, but darkness is really good at killing fellow guardians, not much else. I personally don't think that's a power guardians need. 
---
Happend to me while doing regular gambit won 3 times in a row but none of them counted.
---
Yeah we are playing on regular Gambit, not Prime.
---
won‚Äôt notice the nerf if you land your shots
---
Not so experienced, but I'm talking about insurrection prime exactly. :(
---
Wait what
---
I feel attacked
---
Im siding with the vanguard because of shin malphur fuck the drifter.
---
AFAIK: The portal opens.
---
Can't believe I didn't think of this, I'm here grinding normal strikes about to rip my arm off over other guardians doing the exact same thing as me, can't blame them though.
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
Now u Titans understand how we feel after you guys Got our NovaWarp over nerfed next your supers are going to be nerfed hopefully
---
I'm just mad that now I gotta run multiple ammo finders and get me a new sniper for scourge final boss
---
Major spec is the best since that's the only thing it struggles against.
---
Run the nightfalls that have an exotic ship sparrow ir ghost, they drop from the final chest as an exotic engram 
---
White nail is still bugged and randomly won't proc, you will feel that ammo hit from time to time.
---
it‚Äôs definitely not a broken mechanic; if you‚Äôre planning to be a sentry, your SOLE PURPOSE is to kill said invader, so why not run some weapons specifically for that? slap on a sniper and/or a linear and map them. they typically spawn on one fo the sides that the ads aren‚Äôt spawning on, so you just have to be weary and keep an eye out on your radar (hell, the radar boost mod that you can get from Ada helps a good amount with that)
---
i‚Äôve never had that issue since they fixed the whole well of radiance bug with it
---
There is no reason not to use Midnight Coup after forsaken... the gun looks cool and feels awesome. There are some year 1 weapons which feel so good to use eventhough their dps performance lacks a bit meanwhile. Nobody ever will convince me to dismantle my good old Better Devils or my Manannan. That simply wont happen. ;)

This is how your reverse a scenario... I fucking can not stand the actor who portrays Doug Judy. He plays the same fucking cringe worthy character each time.
---
We ran well + teather and blew through it.   It‚Äôs a new high level activity, we know how to do this.  
---
Yeah glass is a bitch for it but stiles used to be like this when they were not a hundred and something levels below us 
---
Two things I did not mention.  One...Every Friday at reset Xur will appear on a random planet ([whereisxur.com](https://whereisxur.com), or look for the post on here about an hour after reset).  Xur sells Y1 exotics and a fated engram for shards (need about 200 to buy everything he has).  You will want to buy everything he has in stock, then get the fated engram.  the fated engram is guaranteed to give you one Y1 exotic you do not have until your collection is complete.  One per account per week, and the armor is specific to the character you are on (meaning you cannot get warlock armor if you are on a hunter).
---
Two...you want to join a clan.  You can get a weekly clan power engram from Hawthorne. 
---
That illustration is as close as i will get to owning it
---
You lucky duck. 
---
The mouse cursor lmao
---
Warlock - Vanguard: Because he won't dare defy the Praxic Order
---
Hunter - Vanguard: Because she's not planning on dying to Shin Malphur any time soon
---
Titan - Drifter: Because she's headstrong and thinks getting close to the Drifter is the only way to know his full plan and stop him
---
I guess I'm boring cause I'm not willing to dirty my characters. But come on, I've been defending this city since D1 launch, so of course I wanna side with the Vanguard.
---
Thanks man. This helped a lot.
---
Roomba
---
Ding!
---
What order did you do them, ideal is start with Ada-1 or Petra get a high level powerful do other things to balance out and go do another big powerful.
---
Also the forge can help you can control where the powerfull goes IE heavy or energy slot gets the powerful.
---
At 650 Ada-1 dropped a 657,  soon after st 655 I got Shards from a crucible match that were 664. 
---
Spoilers in destiny. Is that a thing? Really?
---
Idk man just sayin that people complain about things as soon as they come out :D
---
Uses the term snowflakes then complains about someone being rude lol

"Mickle, go through the conduit before this place explodes!"

But the DPS is not the same‚Äîtesting indicates that the DPS is about 75% of what it was before ([see this post and the top comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/axs8ai/threat_level_the_new_damage_values_patch_220/) ). You may feel that the better ammo economy is worth it (I personally don‚Äôt think the trade off was worth it) but it‚Äôs just objectively untrue that the DPS is the same.
---
Only possibility was that player population was REALLY low to the point it was the closest match, and/or a 2100 player or 2 were on a team on 0(making the effective glory 1150. Reseting glory is definitely bs.
---
Actually interesting character &gt; 2 pieces of cardboard 
---
You do you bud. It's not for everyone. If you dont like it, that doesn't affect my enjoyment. And if somebody is asking if they should come back, the current state of the game is what is most important and why would anyone want to skip any part of the story? Rasputin is an important part of lore and lots of us fans enjoyed the story. 
---
Best of luck. 
---
Try not to let CoO ruin the entire game for you.

Holy fuck that‚Äôs incredible.

I havent started,  but im going vanguard. I mean, im reivensbane, dredgen, and wayfarer. All i need for cursebreaker is ghost. Im dedicated to the vanguard

---
To my understanding the powerful reward gives you a bump to the light level of your lowest item in slot, even if your average is above your lowest item. However There may be a soft cap on light level until tier 3 of reckoning is released because it will recommend 670 light. At least that what I, a non-developer, am lead to believe.
---
Lol
---
The podiac bandit he's hella mysterious but great.
---
It‚Äôs been long standing information that a ghost named ‚Äúpulled pork‚Äù has selected the bow dead Uldren to become a guardian, why they didn‚Äôt cremate his body is beyond me.

Yes. But... uh.... shut up. It looks like xur shit

But they also buffed all shotguns. It‚Äôs total Damage remains close to the same. If you factor buffs/debuffs (WoR and MP), it can actually do more total damage now.

Pretty sure Bungo noticed how people would get out of their way in Gambit to do bounties, even if they were really stupid, and implemented the genius solution of having, essentially, bounties for doing the right things in the new Gambit Prime.  
---
I mean, I recall the community suggesting to remove the really stupid ones (aerial sidearm kills) and introduce new useful ones (kill envoys), but apparently they were way ahead on that idea and took it up to 11, by locking the really cool and shiny new gear behind long bounties, quests and triumphs that require you to consistently play a role.
---
In general, Gambit Prime and its bounties are really well done, except for the weekly Collector one, which is actually harder to do when you have a better team (less motes lost -&gt; less motes you can pick up during a match).
---
Holy shit Terry as Shax would be amazing, I might actually care about PvP again.
---
So some random ass ghost went and revived uldren? 
---
Hmm, what do you mean by that? And if you want i can downvote you.
---
Mainly the guy using a fusion at 70m lmao. The guy in the cave a little bit, but I think he was trying to hide, fair enough. The other two were preoccupied killing the blockers to stop the drain, which imo should be the main concern even with an invader in. But, that should just take a nade and a few shots.
---
Yes and no. You would have to kill the same three twice before killing the last one.
---
Wow.
---
To be fair, this is mainly because Bungie fucked the weekly bounties.
---
Like say our guardian was in a comic or

Movie and it would make them a hunter

Kill every single enemy till youre at the boss room.

( In the room where the big oger spawn + the big yellow one... You only have, (when you enter the room), to look straight forward ...5sec. after enter the room... Big yellow boy spawn, kill him instantly. After this the oger spawn. Do the same. Shoot him. (After killing these two enemies go wipe.)
---
You spawn in the room where you died but without enemies there + the Walk√ºre has spawned ....
---
When you're fighting against xol go to the side from where you coming and there stay behind the walls on the left or on the right..( take this side where xol is look up)

These spots are Savespots! No enemie can kill you there! 
---
+ On these small spots you can go closely to xol without get killed from him! 
---
Save you're super for the enemies!
---
When you're out of heavy ammo go a little bit to the left/right corner of the wall, so the enemies can spot you. Wait till little Smurfs coming, punch them when you lucky you get new ammo. 
---
(When you have the skill and cojones in you're pants you can also take the Walk√ºre which are spawning! But don't cry if you die!

---
They need to remake it 
---
I feel like it also might be a Mulligan bug tbh. I‚Äôve had shots totally miss and get my three shots back
---
You only get teleported out for killing all four of the individual guardians, not necessarily four guardian kills. 
---
I got the Warlock Gloves yesterday.  They are kind of underwhelming.  I can't think of any situation where they would be better than Geo Mags or Skull of Dire Ahamkara.
---
If only it was more active!
---
Wow! I like so much this art! I like how you use those shades and lines. Can you give link for more arts? Do you usually make vectors like these?
---
This reference make me feel old for some reason 
---
Nope. Their IG username isn‚Äôt the same as their Reddit username, that‚Äôs all. They watermark with their IG tag.
---
This will be even better once we can get the second tier of the reaper perk more easily, running two special weapons will be even better and won‚Äôt require special ammo finder. Makes it so that a multi kill of 5 enemies will drop a special brick for you and teammates that will completely refill your special ammo. 
---
It‚Äôs also questionable as to whether special ammo finder is worth stacking that much. 
---
Currently, you can get the perk with three pieces of illicit reaper armour and consuming a synth for the six points needed. Once tier 2 goes live, 3 pieces of tier 2 armour will do it without needing the consumable. 
---
No i mean like why would you think our character should be a hunter main?

im in my thirties if that helps haha

In a week or two there will be a quest that you have to decide to side with either the drifter or the vanguard. That choice will follow you all season so pick wisely

I know Alot of people love the drifter.

But God damn I hate his voice
---
So true.
---
It‚Äôs four guardian kills in my experience. The triumph is possible with the right supers and luck but it‚Äôs absolutely possible 
---
Oh sweet thanks for sharing!
---
It feels right especially if they made a movie that includes all this new shit going on since I can‚Äôt really imagine a titan or warlock willingly(emphasis on this cause yor got corrupted)  going rouge and siding with the drifter 
---
Had that a few times...
---
thanks Bungo, I hate it!
---
I‚Äôm PC :(
---
I‚Äôm on PC, are you?

Pretty much

Love it, keep posting

It's not the awoken way. You have to find a marble table and leave the body there with a white blanket. It's in the awoken lore from d1 grimoire card "awoken burial" and d2 lore tab under destinations titled "the sacred grounds".  Once the body decomposes, a fruiting tree emerges, and the awoken eat from it.

cool thanks, ill look into it!!

Yeah, I actually just found out that we know Drifter's Dredgen name. But Shin himself gives Thorn to you in the last chapter, as he did with The Last Word. So I still think that Drifter is a good guy undercover.

It's the thought that counts. I think I could do it, but I don't really play pvp that much, and even with a lot of wins, it's still a hell of a grind for a gun that I'll likely never use.
---
Well how was i supposed to know you also did it? You think im just magically supposed to know what's been made and what's not?
---
üòÇ we were doing a NF last night and the wiped us, even though no one died. Then i got an infant rank up and some gambit boots. 
---
Holy shit. So he was playing as a good Dredgen? That‚Äôs insane man thanks so much 
---
I even type it in PC chat and they just shoot at me and jump into the portal....
---
Shoots a lot slower, but the extra damage that shotguns do in general compensates. It's just not as appealing, in a way,  because you can't just let your whole load loose. 
---
After the nerf to trench barrel I was using it differently any way. Now I don't feel like I'm wasting ammo because I can perfectly get 3 shots off instead of 4 or 5.
---
Maybe could be the allegiance thing is all a misunderstanding in the end with shin and the vanguard preparing for savanthun and the praxic fire arent aware of it so think the drifter is the bad guy. Cant wait till the quest begins.
---
Hello yeah. Mines got Rampage/Feeding Frenzy and a stability masterwork. It‚Äôs a beast.

D2 functioned as a game.
---
D2 was not riddled with literally thousands of bugs
---
D2 wasn't plagued with crazy long load screens
---
D2 didn't have 1 Strike
---
D2 had actual various planets and DIFFERENT environments in "freeplay"
---
D2 had a raid at launch
---
D2 had pvp at launch
---
D2 did not suffer from downgrade advertisement
---
D2 had interesting builds and exotic gear to collect
---
D2 has a compelling story that wasn't 10 hours long
---
D2's audio never dropped out for no apparent reason demanding a reboot
---
D2 didn't light PS4's on fire / brick them
---
D2 didn't ban top players and streamers because of mechanics the devs put in the game
---
D2's best weapon wasn't the starter weapon obtained at the beginning of the game

D2 had some issues.  Sure.  But this is on a whole new level of Fallout 76 memes

I was trying to figure out why Gambit had suddenly became Mayhem with your Super... Haven't gotten to a round 3 yet in the revised Gambit. Good to know. 
---
i know. I tried to invade yesterday. I usually don't invade, but if no one invades then it's pointlessbto leave the portal open.
---
So i checked. There was no 4 stack or at least not from the same clan. Went through the portal. Sneaked towards them... saw 3 glaring spots (snipers) just waiting for my ass, a hunter with tether unleashed his super right on a ledge and then i got fucked up badly when they approached me like fucking zombies.
---
It was a terrifying experience.
---
Does the third round in normal gambit act as mayhem for your supers?
---
üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ boo hoo

Can confirm that you have to keep an eye on the radar. I keep my eyes 70% on radar and keep pre charging until i see movement and then I shoot them. Works 95% of the time

When the higher tier Reconings come, there will be better versions of the illicit sets that give more points , so dont worry about it. Tier 2 comes out tomorrow.

I've always found breakneck pretty reliable. And Cerberus if you've got it is petty powerful

I love it still. Consistently hard hitting, great rapid fire. I feel like I can tear through a crowd with accuracy just as well as I can pump pellets into a bosses face.

Chain supers and don't hesitate on the heavy too much. I usually burn through the ammo i get from the raid banner and only use additional drops on the boss. Hammerhead is nice this week, since void does more damage

I thought I was on the wrong sub for a second.
---
He used to be a dredgen to be exact shin malphur created the shadows of yor after killing yor himself. In order to stop future guardians becoming like yor. He then took the name dredgen vale and through that dredgen hope joined who is the drifter. But left possibly due to being under the wrong empression that the shadows of yor were yor fanatics like the drifter. So know shin and the vanguard allowed the drifter to give malfeasance away to guardians and those guardians are the targets of shin to weed out guardians who want to gain power via the darkness.
---
That's a cool info thanks buddy!
---
Ghosts can reconstruct a body from explosive deaths that leave little more than tiny parts of a body, or long decayed skeletons. I'm sure ashes are fine.
---
Can you only get it through soloing nightfalls?
---
For those wondering how good they are, they do one shot with top tree arcstrider. In order to proc it, you have to melee or get melee'd, so you either gotta 2 hit them or they have to be going for a melee with you at full hp. What it is useful for is finishing one person off with a melee and then one hitting anyone nearby. The problem with it is basically everyone uses shotguns, so you'll often get dust rocked before being able to make it worthwile.
---
I am assuming that low tier is +1 mid tier +2 and high tier is +3, if I am wrong, I will be happy
---
Ding! dIng! diNg! dinG! DING!
---
imma do one each because I just ignore my warlock, they both seem the same to me.  Both trying to protect granted the drifter has a lot more up their sleeve, but the vanguard is stuck up and caused Cayde's death due to their isolationist policies.  The praxic order seems a bit totalitarian for my taste so I would join with the drifter anyways because I don't see things in black/white.
---
I‚Äôm talking about yeeting him into the sun. 
---
Can you please elaborate, I am missing something...
---
Very underwhelming and very situational in my experience. If someone punches you, you can punch them back and 1 shot them. If you hit someone with an (arc only) melee ability, then you can punch them again and kill them just as fast as you normally would. The only difference is you get health back. 
---
There are better arcstrider exotics for PvP or PvE. For me this is just another brand new exotic that goes straight into the garbage. 
---
If you have a good amount of legendary shards I recommend buying planetary materials from Spider. Simulation Seeds are your best investment as the shaders break down into legendary shards.
---
It's a bit time consuming but you'll get back about 70% of your legendary shards after breaking everything down, a good chunk of enhancement cores, some mod components and occasionally an exotic.

No !!! But this is the most effective way. Cause when you in a fireteam you have to share you're kills with mates!
---
It was confirmed kinetically that he's a warlock

I'm well aware of the attitude he has and to my knowledge the rest of the mods on this sub are very helpful and respectful, besides this one, he must have been bullied when he was younger.

Trust me ! Work with my manual some posts down and I guarantee you win

What's all this siding stuff I haven't heard anything about this.  is there like a faction war something coming
---
Nicely done, that looks great! Now I just need to get my PS4 out of storage and finish the Luna quest I started like a year ago.
---
You can ‚Äúconsume‚Äù a synth instead of using it in the reckoning to get +3 for that role for I believe 30 minutes. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs game time or real time.

man the lore in the game is almost to deep!  Good reads, thanks for the info

TY for all the replies! Sounds like I understood and when I want to play I‚Äôll need to snag Forsaken.

Again, thanks for the help!

I'm surprised how long the collector bounty takes compared to the other weekly bounties too. 500 motes is such a large number of games, even if you're on top of your collecting game.
---
DING
---
That H√§kko is so hot right now.
---
is this a story thing for the new dlc that I don't know about?
---
I'm pretty sure it's better for the team if a few get a lot of motes. That way you send big blockers. I'm not sure where the meta is exactly on blockers, but big blockers are better this season.

Do you have proof?

I can dere-lick my own balls, thank you.

Yeah ive been through the same, some say they want to help and will guide you but end up rushing a lot of the raid and only really explain the first or second encounter.  Then the negative discord chat starts up, always seem to one guy in the group who wants to argue with everyone :/

I gotta ask. If I went out and bought Forsaken right now, will I also get the Annual Pass? Or will I have to buy that separately? I'm waiting for the next dlc sale right now, and these two things have got me super confused. (and It's also kind of hard to find some info on it)
---
Yeah that's all I seem to find they all say they like helping people get through but just leave or act like total ass's when you don't know how to do something like them etc.
---
Ahhh tits. Thanks for the info. Guess I haven't been paying much attention lately.
---
Same, I'd rather get in 3 shots that I know will hit, than wildly blast through my entire magazine for the same damage. The dps is theoretically the same, but now there's more control and better ammo economy.
---
What platform you on bud?
---
Okay! What about the sleeper stimulant?
---
(Laughs in breakneck and chaos reach)
---
&gt; You gotta a main warlock
---
Go Figure (outlaw, rampage) as it lets my kill ass without going too far from the bank and is good against invaders. Jotun to kill/zone invaders and kill blockers (works well with 1st sentry passive). Power weapon is more personal preference, I like a cluster rocket for boss melting 
---
As a warlock main I run well of radiance with lunafaction (guessing phoenix protocol would be better but don't have it). 
---
For Titan I'm guessing u want want melting point sunbreaker (probably with hallowfire heart). For hunter maybe golden gun (with the tree that gives super energy on prescion hits) with nighthawk to quickly kill larger blockers.
---
That does not work in the way you described, but nice ‚Äûbrag‚Äú
---
What is that warlock set? Looks nice
---
good point... damn
---
*laughs in two tailed fox and blade barrage*
---
Another douche.
---
Thank you for the clarification. I still wasn't sure. Much appreciated. 
---
Unless I‚Äôm drunk at 3pm, I think that is Malfeasance 
---
Maybe someone can tell me this...
---
Invaders during the primeval phase:
---
Are they on a set timer or does the other team automatically get one as soon as you kill your third envoy and get your damage well?
---
The off chance that you have it, heart of inmost light. 
---
Can be used to keep your melee recharged and buff it without the caveat of having to save your super. 
---
Once you get used to it, it‚Äôs very effective. 
---
Otherwise, I‚Äôd probably just stick with synthoceps. 
---
I like to run moebius quiver, throw tethers all over the place
---
(Laughs in full invader set and hammer of sol)
---
I'm especially pissed about the Ada 1 bounties. It's my go to for grinding engrams and I'm completely locked out of them because I can't do any of the weeklies. Great start to the season....
---
heroic strikes or nightfalls I think
---
Full team of thunderlords does the same thing
---
*Laughs in Polaris lance and map awareness and assassin's munition perk*
---
You say that as if normal gambit wasnt the basis of gambit prime, which was also released in s4. everyone had ample time to learn gambit lol
---
But it isn‚Äòt. Have look at the engrams in Eversum and a special look to the ornaments.
---
You just lost your own bet.
---
I just got these last night for my Warlock. They are great fun! Love them! 
---
Sounds like you need to just move on and find another game man to play man.  
---
That coat is an exotic not sure about the rest
---
Finally another person who uses Zenith, way better than ikelos IMO, but have you used it since the update, it's pretty disappointing.
---
What's with all the wizards trying to prove themselves.  Nobody is even talking about you dress wearing, grenade swallowing, floating ass fools.
---
(Laughs in queenbreaker and sleeper simulant)
---
*laughs in nerf hammer* 
---
People like you give me hope
---
this community is a bunch of bungie fan boys you got an opinion that says the games dlc wasnt that goood not even in a toxic way and its down voted to hell
---
The multipliers got reduced so it has to be way past 100 to get higher multipliers. We had it at 112 and only got 1.11 multiplier or somewhere in that range
---
(Laughs in nerf blade barrage because they made the explosions do more damage)
---
*laughs in area of effect Is my thing anyways*
---
The fuck is Reckoning?
---
So is 7th Column.  Nothing new about medals that require ridiculous luck.
---
(Laughs in DING and thorn)
---
It‚Äôs not that sweaty, a lot of noobs and if you have 3 friends that play often it‚Äôs a fun time. If you‚Äôre referring to invading being the sweaty aspect I can assure you it‚Äôs not. As of right now the only thing you can call sweaty is the invader. The boss can‚Äôt be instantly melted and takes a few stacks. The invader can make or break most matches but as long as 2 people play aggressive and don‚Äôt let the invader sit back and pick off your team the invader isn‚Äôt a problem especially when you‚Äôre expecting an invade 
---
Hey I‚Äôm on pc, trying to get Luna‚Äôs howl and the recluse. Would you be able to help me reach fabled? (I‚Äôm not very good, 1.0 kd)
---
There's lots of criticism here. Tone is important. 
---
Likewise, $30 for 9 months of content is really not that bad. You just came across as really entitled, is all.
---
*laughs in thorn and outlast* 
---
I kept wondering why I couldn't get the Oracle offering bounty
---
It always feels really good to see this after the crappy console servers and your own bad internet have kicked you out of a Gambit Prime game you were about to win for the second time in a row. Those being the first to Gambit Prime games you every tried to play. Yeah, last night was fun. thx Bungo
---
Someone placed on yesterday and it disappeared during the encounter is this suppose to happen? I only ask because I‚Äôve never used it. 
---
New mode to get gambit prime armor. 
---
Gambit prime is **not designed for solo play**.
---
Im sorry but this is the sad truth. Find a team, join a clan, something. It's a way better experience when you can actually discuss roles, wear the appropriate armor, and bait invaders/strategize for the final dps phase. 
---
Half Dan D. I got this thing woth kill clip and tap the trigger and amazing. 36 per crit and 47 per ceit with kill clip active
---
I got this problem too and its really annoying seeing that knowing we can't complete it.
---
Does somebody know if bungie will fix or will crimson days return?
---
Heard that. I just dont have the best roll. But once I do I'll try it 
---
Give it 2 weeks before you comp queue especially if you solo it.
---
Looks great!
---
Nice work Quentin!
---
Timer. You can wait to kill the third envoy until after being invaded and won‚Äôt have to deal with them when damaging the primeval. 
---
I would not say that it is a "terrible PvP mode" but  it does suffer from certain design flaws that are difficult to avoid. From a PvE aspect, the pace is more frenetic than regular Gambit, but once more players discover the most optimal strategies and once they get the more optimal gear sets, it will become more difficult.
---
I believe the solution will lie with better and more granular matchmaking, but that in itself can serve as a problem as waiting times for matches between teams that are more equivalent in gear and experience go higher.
---
Thanks! Come bank motes with meeee XD
---
Where exactly did you find this piece of lore?
---
Got datamined here is a video explaining what they found.
---
https://youtu.be/jymPs8OJylk
---
It'll get better (I hope). Right now a lot of people have no idea what the hell they're doing, but they'll figure out that it's awful to play unless you play as a team.
---
I strongly avide you to join a clan if you haven't already and create a team. Gambit Prime is a blast when you're coordinated with people who know what they are doing
---
Vanguard and Drifter are on the same side. It's Aunor and the Praxics vs Drifter and the Vanguard
---
It's exactly the same as Rallying a banner for a public event, useful to run by one and snag it. If a public event is active in a strike grab the banner for full ammo/super.
---
Haha yes! That was a fun fight though.
---
I have 20 in my inventory thinking I could plop one down whenever I wanted... I was mistaken. Glad I have a use now.
---
Last night was glass. Try again on better mods.
---
Gambit Prime currently sucks with randoms, but I think it'll get better. I won my first game (day one people were competent), and then yesterday more new players were joining, and it was awful. I think as people start to understand what needs to be done (kill blockers unless you *really* enjoy watching your motes disappear, stand in the damn well, etc.) it'll get better, but yeah, it's brutal at the moment.
---
The PvE portion is pretty fun, though.
---
I thought that was a bug. It's basically the opposite of a bug that was fixed a couple months ago. 
---
Also, when they implement new features they will say so in patch notes, and there was nothing in the patch notes about nightfall modifiers. 
---
Not for nothing... But walking into Gambit with a Nova bomb made me forget barrage right quick. Until this week. 
---
That I‚Äôm not sure of because gambit prime has considerably harder enemies.
---
Yep! Same. A bit too frequent if you ask me but making hay while the sun shines
---
When you nut but she keep sucking.
---
If you ever want to complete a raid use the Destiny 2 companion app that is available for download on both Android &amp; iOS platforms.
---
It‚Äôs a great way to connect with fellow Destiny players who are seeking to complete activities such as Raids, Gambit, Crucible as well as any and all other Destiny related modes.
---
I‚Äôm sure a lot of people would be happy to teach you how to complete a raid such as the Last Wish raid.
---
Of course I personally would recommend looking up a video on the basic mechanics of said raid so you at least have ( even if a vague ) understanding on what to do, it‚Äôll help you and all others involved.
---
If you haven‚Äôt already tried I wish you good luck!
---
Eyes up Guardian!
---
\*cloaked hunter runs by\*
---
Warlock: *"Hey Boys it's a spy!"*
---
Not fixed this Sunday per se. 
---
The weekly bounties that are affected will reset on Sundays instead of Tuesdays until they do launch a fix. 
---
How exactly does it "not work in the way I described?" I'm not saying the spawns will cooperate every time, but that is absolutely how I got the triumph.
---
On Emerald Coast, flanked the other team while they were bunched up in the middle fighting the Primeval and killed them all using Hammerhead, reloaded with Feeding Frenzy/AA, caught them again after they all respawned back in the starting area which is basically a corridor. Killed three, the timer ended, got sent home.
---
It was definitely a "right place right time" sort of thing, but to call it an Impossible Triumph is a MASSIVE overstatement. It's achievable with good timing (and again, cooperative respawns).
---
If you die to something stupid, I‚Äôm just punishing you because you will probably lose more motes
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs luck anymore. They increased the chance that it is cloudy with a chance of meatballs so it‚Äôs just as likely as the other bosses. 
---
Fill yer boots before they in-f*ck it
---
Do what many others are doing, take a break from the game. 
---
Speak with your time, as deej asked us to do.
---
Dont like it, dont play.
---
Play and not like it, dont expect change. 
---
Really? Even with the nerf to Machine guns?
---
The clan points you gain by playing now count towards the 5000xp weekly.
---
*writes down note to make sequel meme*
---
Gambit prime is a 4v4 cooperative game. Much moreso even than regular gambit. Communication is important to the point you will lose any game you arnt in constant communication. Join a group
---
Why is that Jay?
---
Not fixed per se. 
---
These bounties are expected to have their weekly reset on Sundays instead of Tuesdays until a fix is launched. 
---
I got mine in normal .. but its higher chance in nightfall i think    .. 
---
Turns out it‚Äôs edge transit. Hears satan laughing his ass off in the distance
---
I usually use a handicap mod of 110, go in with solar singe and grenade mod.
---
As a titan with hollowfire heart and 5x grenade mods, my grenade has a 3 second cooldown and tick for 21k. 
---
Easily solo any nightfall.
---
To some degree yes. Duos sent at the same time would be the meta, to drain motes. But I would agree 2 mediums sent together is a lot better than 2-3 smalls, they can immune each other but are very squishy. Although we won't know how crazy the 20 mote blocker is till next week at some point. I do think just keeping your motes till you have at least 5 is wiser now, assuming your team is communicating banking. 
---
I‚Äôm on the last step, if anyone wants to play and grind to Fabled, add me: KingXMC
---
I‚Äôm about to be 34 and out of the group I play with I‚Äôm the youngest. Think out oldest is mid 50‚Äôs. Keep on shooting shit bud ;)
---
Those are the Wings of Sacred Dawn, it makes you look like a space pimp!
---
First, I'm not convinced nightfall power handicaps not contributing to the modifier until they are above 100 is an intended change. After updates the game is always full of bugs, and intended new features are listed in both This Week at Bungie news posts and patch notes. 
---
2.55 is a pretty good modifier, but it might not be enough for the ones this week. Shorter ones with less enemies, like Will of the Thousands, might require a modifier of around 3 unless you can kill things *really* fast. 
---
I recommend putting on extinguish, match game (only need to bring damage of 2 elements for Will of the Thousands and Strange Terrain), and a third detrimental modifier like grounded or blackout. Add a singe, as well. I like to match singes to the damage type there is the least of in the nightfall, but some people like to match it to the element of their super or weapons. 
---
You are tripping 
---
Drifter best character in destiny 
---
This shook me to my core 
---
If it makes you feel any better, I also feel like this most of the time as a 27 year old
---
I love that slayer rift. 4 dip shits sitting in one spot while I invade and only have to use one rocket to kill them all lol
---
It can't roll Outlaw, but it can have Rapid Hit/Rampage, Kill Clip or Multikill Clip which might be stupid good in PvP.
---
It was probably done to compensate for the light lvl increase being 700 now
---
Tangentially related... With the new rocket launcher non-cluster buff, is a team of 6x WC users the new way to cheese Riven?
---
I dont t Thunderlord was touched
---
In practise, I find gambit prime to feel a lot less sweaty than normal gambit. It might just be because everyone is still floundering around trying to figure out the new map and mechanics. 
---
I do think it's a great idea to wait before buying things. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise! 
---
Try it for your own, Go to the D2 App. Got to Everversum. Go to the seasonal engrams. Go to ornaments. Got to Polaris Lance and then 3dview. Et voila!
---
This is pretty much what I've seen so far. First day winning a couple of matches as a solo. Then yesterday I was able to play with a couple of sweaties and it was awesome. Today losing 4 matches back to back, joining when the enemy team was about to kill the prime evil. Hope it gets better with team, otherwise it's going to be tough for soloes.
---
Lovers quarrel?
---
When you are an immortal space wizard, your worst enemies are your teammates.
---
glad i didnt dump too much time into this yet...waiting for tier 3
---
Well, maybe a new developer/publisher should make a spritual successor. A modern spore would be incredible... unless it's made by EA.
---
When they do things like that, they say so in the patch notes or TWABs. Since they said nothing, it seems to me like a bug. 
---
How it works is that power handicaps of 0-100 now don't contribute to the score modifier. There's no way that is an intended feature, *especially* given we had no notice that this was happening. 
---
Transmat firing!
---
Hunter main here but, nova bomb warlock with a tractor cannon is op AF!
---
If you want to take part in season of the drifter content, you‚Äôll need to get Forsaken + Annual Pass first. 
---
If you get that, play through campaigns to hit level 50 then the drifter will give you power surge bounties that will give you 640 gear. 
---
Then you can do whatever.
---
You could just get Forsaken and have access to a lot of new content but you won‚Äôt be able to get the power surge bounties or take part in any of this new gambit prime or the black armoury content. 
---
Your opinion is just as valid as their downvotes. 
---
Well f*ck my luck I‚Äôll have to grind some meatballs 
---
thanks?
---
Yeah its simple and complicated at the same time lol. If you need more info i would watch youtube vids on it. 
---
You should do a not forgotten 
---
Id wait and let this season play out.  Max exodus going on again, much like early d2. 
---
See how next season looks and maybe pick it up then. 
---
Adds are 650, nothing is 700 yet. 
---
my go to 100k NF modifier is Max LL handicap and Heavy lifting. I think that puts you at 2.9x or so. A fast run is easy 100k
---
Is there any chance to get this in 3440x1440 resolution?
---
It's a very cool artwork and a great tribute to the handgun.
---
Of possibly the prime zone? I think ones on titan. ‚ò∫
---
My clan and I have run two completions this week so far.  We noticed no real difference on cluster bombs...... wavesplitter does alot more dmg to her.  
---
what about forsaken, i heard many of the base games complaints were fixed? or is that not enough and i should just wait?
---
Could u fuck off kindly grammar nazi?
---
ive done it in past seasons. now i have to try to do it. Slova bomb works well after 3 kills from a distance and all are grouped up
---
You probably won't find another 150 hand cannon with outlaw/rampage because of Midnight Coup, but you can get Spare Rations with perks to your liking and rapid hit/rampage/kill clip or multi kill clip, which are close enough.
---
My best friend has one with Fluted Barrel, Richochet rounds, rapid hit and rangefinder. I could visibly see the range it had just watching his character kill enemies.
---
As long as you dont kill all 4 separate people you can keep going.
---
Likewise. Moebius + Orpheus Rig is amazing.
---
Haha, exactly how I feel and I am 50!
---
dang, sucks that you're on PS4.
---
I'm sure you'll find someone.
---
I've done 4 myself, through battlenet/PC.
---
I don't really get anything for doing any more though :/
---
Check their names on destinytracker and view their match history. 2 people leaving occurs more often than I'd like, people dodging out last second in fear of facing a stack. 
---
If their match history looks suspicious screen capture those and whatever video you have and send to bungie. I guess that's about all you can do. 
---
Gambit prime:
---
- drops synths that are used to create armour
---
- has a weekly challenge to drop a powerful reward (above your level). Requires 4 matches. 
---
- has a chance to drop normal power level (below your level) gambit prime weapons during the match when doing certain things (killing high value targets, cashing notes, killing blockers/invaders, invading and killing opponents)
---
The Reckoning:
---
- has a weekly challenge for a powerful drop. Requires completions. 
---
- take the synths into this to create gambit prime armour at normal power levels
---
The Drifter:
---
- rewards a powerful level gambit prime weapon as part of the intro quest that walks you through the process of getting synths and making armour
---
- gets a weekly bounty after completing your first armour that drops a powerful level gambit prime helmet. 
---
Other:
---
- gambit prime raises infamy rank which drops a normal level piece of normal gambit gear on partion ranks (1 -&gt; 2 or 2 -&gt; 3) and a powerful piece on full ranks (3 -&gt; 1). 
---
- primes can drop during gambit prime as with anywhere else. 
---
It‚Äôs essentially a horde mode. You deposit a mote, You kill a bunch of adds then a boss and you can get gambit gear after wards. At least that‚Äôs what tier 1 is. 
---
Thank you.
---
That's what I thought and that is also the strategy I thought would be best... But it, of course, hasn't been working out that way as a solo. 
---
I‚Äôm in my 40‚Äôs  and in the core group of about 10 people I play with our ages run from 15- 60. We watch what we say around the younger people, But we have a lot of fun.
---
It‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre the 500th person to post this or anything 
---
E D G E
---
I've been playing and solo, and I've seen this 50/50. My teammates are play with me like we're a four way married quartet of pure love or teammates that cold shoulder my dead body, but we still win some times......
---
Ppl just won't revive, and I cant understand why if you're standing Right next to someone.
---
Oh yea I forgot about that 
---
(Gets one eyed mask after patch)
---
Some issues fixed, more created.
---
To sum it up, all they did was go straight to the other side of the spectrum. 
---
Hard to keep a player base playing when the game caters to the outliers. 
---
The first 2 days of a new season and there was zero increase in player pop.
---
What does that tell you?
---
You can and will do what ever you want.  As a guy with 7000+ hours invested in d1 &amp; 2, founder of a clan, and loves the game, I would wait.  
---
Prism and Heavyweight wasn't so bad.
---
You don't even need to equip the gear to get higher light level gear to drop. So long as it's in your inventory you are good. So I am basically just running 650 with my good gear until I can hit 700 then upgrading. The infusion system sucks, gotta deal with it as it is. Besides that point, there is no new raid to compel you to require a higher working light level so there's no urgency at all.
---
Thanks for sharing. 
---
Exactly the same situation üòÇ hit me up sometime and we'll raid together
---
BuT wHy WaStE tImE aNd BuLlEtS oN sHiElDeD aDs WhEn ThE bOsS hAs So MuCh HeAlTh?
---
Ghosts need some sort of remains for first resurrection, after that they can resurrect after disintegration 
---
yea, ill probably wait then. thanks for the input
---
ahh alright thanks.
---
What platform you play on?
---
pc
---
Can someone tell that to the hunter and warlock that spent 2 minutes using their supers and heavy against the primeval as soon as it spawned? I can get the first time around but not for 2 minutes straight when it says immune
---
yeah fuck that
---
no problem
---
Umm, yea..  don't ask for upvotes on your own post.  You're just gonna get the opposite.
---
I haven't seen those two new perks before! What do they do? I got a Bug Out Bag SMG with zen moment and one of the new perks, whose name escapes me. It refills grenade energy on kills, and when you use your grenade, it reloads the weapon. 
---
Unfortunately, I'm not exactly sure how to get more of these Gambit Prime weapons. 
---
I feel you there. Still on the hand cannon phase and my one comp match was nothing but Blast Furnace and shotguns.
---
Fuck comp ranking in a looter-shooter.
---
My voice is never as shrill as when I'm being revived while I'm looking right at the invader standing there with QB just waiting for the inevitable to happen...
---
Enhancement cores need more sources to drop from imo. There's a lot we can do with infusion now, so the amount we come by should increase. All bounties should give at least 3, and there should be a chance for them to drop in the wild, and from end of activity chests. 
---
I'd be down to help grind for it too, never really went for it last season, I'm Mythoclast#11510
---
It's affecting a lot of people. Bungie have acknowledged it in Twitter.
---
Thanks for the tips!
---
It has Cut And Run in it
---
Bungo give us more of this in the dialogue challenge.
---
Seriously, I love Ikora and Zavala, they're both great characters. But most of their personality is in the loretabs so a good portion of the fanbase doesn't even know they exist, and it's a shame. I hope Bungie will take more steps to put their characterizations in-script. 
---
Also that loretab was fucking *great*. 
---
Read someone say that they are fixing it Sunday.
---
The next generation of Pokemon is looking great! 
---
In case you want to know what it is:
---
https://youtu.be/8TQe1NV3lBQ
---
Yeah I manage to get to 640 thanks!! Now I can start grinding those Forges
---
Try Blast Furnace out. It's a solid Kinetic for PvP and PvE.
---
From what I've seen of leaks Drifter is surprised to see you carrying Thorn, which means he's not the one who gives it to you. So you'll get it regardless of who you choose. 
---
To cut short this game of telephone, I will [cite the source!](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/46168)
---
I just turned 44 and I will out-Pong the fuck outta those kids.
---
I play games till i die. 
---
And for some reason it took me a minute to notice the J√∂tunn right there.
---
I feel ya man my ps4 got stolen so i havent had a chance to play anything since black armoury. The only things keeping me going are Aztecross‚Äô videos :(
---
Oh that's rough, buddy
---
Got locked out of Ada and BW bounty from Petra this week.
---
My 64 year old dad would like a word with you
---
You‚Äôre a hero
---
Lol what I‚Äôm 630 and I kick ass in gambito prime the adds are ez too
---
What do I have to do to get it??
---
I was 5 years old in Sunnyvale, 1977, when dad got a hold of a 2600 for christmas.  They didn't even have joysticks yet, just the paddles.  After almost 42 years I earned the right to play any damn game I want.
---
Not super sure, but I think it may be from collector stuff.
---
Basically their business model is utter and total garbage.  I got it a while ago before forsaken and even bought the expansions but never got into it much... so yeah... lots of money out the door and not even really allowed to play at the moment.  Locked at lvl 30...
---
Their model makes it so anyone who once played isn‚Äôt welcome until they give them more cash, never seen a game like it.  I‚Äôm sure there are others... but just wow.
---
No apologies needed, everyone messes up starting out playing new games! All good. Besides, what's the point playing if you cant have fun? ‚úå
---
There‚Äôs an entire youtube community full of destiny 2 fans that make videos of ALL kinds to show how to obtain items and triumphs, why is is not an acceptable solution? People shouldn‚Äôt be dependant on having every bit of info be spoonfed to them, if they want to learn how to play a gamemode they can literally watch a guide while loading into the game and they‚Äôll be good to go. 
---
And doing it that way keeps the d2 youtube community flourishing, which reaches out to more potential new players.
---
Well that‚Äôs all I need to hear. 
---
MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE, ACTIVATEDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
---
With that glas shit on and you basically just die all the time.
---
Yes, I knew that. But only above 1 LL from powerful engrams? Thought it might be an issue.
---
Lol same. I am 32. I still can hang with the best of them though üòò
---
I guess I'm the odd one out then. I still have close to 150, but I don't keep things that are below 600 power unless they're good roles.
---
No, you can hit 700 without the AP, but it will be slower for you since the AP holders have more Powerful Gear activities to grind.
---
And ffs don't kill the envoys if we're being invaded. We can't deal shit to the primeval if we're all dead.
---
im going for vanguard on 2/3 of my characters, so this is false. also read the oxygen sr3 lore.
---
My prime dropped at 666 pl last night as well!!
---
Stop defending PvP play and making fun of people for not liking PvP with one breath, then complaining about blueberries with the next.
---
I hate Gambit, and I'm *definitely* playing Prime, and i'm bringing my worst PvP game. I'ma shoot the invincibles, lurk near the portals, and invade when I have zero chance of getting kills.  This might actually be fun, for once.
---
(J/K I dislike Gambit less than Crucible; at least I can hide when I hear an invader.)
---
the game isnt dead, and anthem is btw
---
I have, I've played in crucible the last time I played destiny 2 on the same character. My other friend who beat the game and DLC also wasn't able to play last night either

Because those videos should be discussing strategies and ways to win, not explaining the basics of how the thing works. Could you imagine if Microsoft released Word without a help file, and left it to people on YouTube to show people how to use their product? This is a product you paid for, just the same, and a developer who can't be assed to type up some text and put it in the game.

That‚Äôs... what a new format is.

If diligent invader is the bounty where you receive the helmet, those matches are regarding reckoning. For the malfeasance, are you playing normal gambit or gambit prime?

The Iron Lords went to Site-6 because it housed Siva. They awoke Rasputin asking him to use Siva to better off the city and humanity. Rasputin knows the uncontrollable nature of Siva and refused and tried to fend off the Iron Lords (using to much force than what was needed), he saw the Iron lords as a threat to the Siva being stored there. Not saying what he did was right, but he was defending his bunker.
