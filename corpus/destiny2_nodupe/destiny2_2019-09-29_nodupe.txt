Bright engrams were a bit different a year ago, the engram also included some mods so the throttle was kind of making people pay to win.

Y1 mods were imo worse than what we have now btw.

Bruh. Cross save has nothing to do with performance. If you are worried about internet lag (which has nothing to do with graphical performance) just plug an ethernet cable into your PC. I'm sure someone else can explain the technical details a bit better, but the short answer is no, cross save will not negatively impact performance on the PC. Cross save simply means you are accessing your save data from another location.

Oh no, we're moving away from file size optimization at ridiculous speeds. Back when we still put games on disks, we had to be careful about file sizes - good compression was a must-have, and games weren't any larger than 30GB out of necessity. Now, everything is digital and marketing teams have discovered that not only do large filesizes make headlines, but indicate that the game has a lot of content. RDR2 (for example) could've been 45GB if Rockstar wanted it to be, but it's simply not as good for marketing as a 110GB game. Destiny 2 with all it's DLC could've been 35GB if Bungie had tried to keep it's size down (without any gameplay or visual hits), but why would they?

Luckily my school gives a day off that Tuesday for some holiday. Poggggg

It's a *fantastic*  Jack of All Trades weapon. PvE? Good at mid level DPS and great at add and major clearing. PvP? Great for just about anything so as long as you can tag the ground near another Guardian or the Guardian themselves. In things like Gambit Prime you can wipe an entire team from a distance in a well with a good shot.
---
Is it the best gun in the game? No but it's fantastic exotic that is useful in any game mode and that for my money makes it a worthy addition to your inventory. I don't leave my ship without it!

Are they talking about the not so secret 3 times xp you get per day

Is it kino?

Get the first Grimoire, should still be in stock at Amazon. First half is the BoS, then LW/Thorn related lore

Feels great to read this thanks!

Does it have to be done in Gofannon?

Warlock. You‚Äôre welcome.

Dont worry, its still avalable, you're just unlucky, sorry man

This trailer was so hype back in the day
---
I liked cayde as much as the next guy, but when I see  500 " gone but not forgotten" posts. It kinda just makes me roll my eyes at it. Thought I would toss my hat in the negative Karma bin here.
---
He left 2 minutes in while we were winning, and he was last with 2 or 3 kills, nice try though, and efficiency only dropped when he left.

IKR

Didn't say it was lol I said it sounds like it. Glasses are important sir. I'm not offended there's no reason to be offended. Everyone's gotta clear their throat at one time or another. Your point is?
---
Blersed
---
I use The Burden like a real man.
---
Youre very welcome. Enjoy the quest. Its a bit grindy.
---
You are not smart, are you?
---
Thanks man. I hope you nailed that shit outta the ball park.
---
Body shot king!
---
I feel this so much. Luna‚Äôs is pretty freaking great though.
---
I do, but the bounty missing (today at least), is "Complete a Heroic Story mission with a Black Armory weapon equipped"
---
Sometimes a bounty would be "Complete an ignition of Bergusia forge" for my Titan, while it would say Izanami for my Hunter
---
Ugh... Yes I know you didn't say it WAS. I was dispelling any beliefs you had that I was even remotely taking things in a personal way. Common sense is important, sir. Exactly, no reason to be offended. So lets drop this and have a happier and greater community. Thanks and have a great day.
---
Well you‚Äôll most likely need the voice actors permission. Then figured out if it is even worth paying the current voice actor and just let him go. Then what if that voice actor moves on and Bungie is in need of a new voice actor. Money.
---
You guys care a disproportionate amount about a handful of troll reviews.
---
Yes, so fun, and it's going to be good for Shadowkeep

So you have chosen death

I need more.

Sorry that his writing was uninteresting but the most meaningful thing he ever did was die.

There is what?

Id give you a award for being the knob on this site lmfao
---
No if you buy exotics from collections they arnt random rolled and only come with a few perks
---
I wish destiny added a 3 squad intro to the moon like they did for new areas your character landed on (first mission on all planets and moons in both) but this time you can see 3 fire-team members with  dialogue telling you why you‚Äôre on the moon (d1 vet accounts: why you‚Äôre back on the moon) and keep the nightmares past hidden and what they truly are in books you find as lore parts
---
Railroad spikes of course!
---
Boooo.  Thanks
---
At least the Burden is instant and gives you no warning you are fucked. You hear Truth coming before they get a team wipe. No aim just shoot and wait.
---
When you spread your legs and jump do you feel anything

You will be able to obtain every pinnacle, it's just there are not making new ones.

doesn‚Äôt matter when you do it, it‚Äôll still be the same stuff. you should probably just open them now

no clue man, some people really need to hit the gym for their frustrations instead of a keyboard. the iron church accepts all.
---
Just watched it, basically answered all my questions since I haven't played 70% of D1.
---
Dude's a legend.
---
Honestly, I find it to be a really fun weapon to play against.. it's actually too easy to dodge. Sure, it hits me sometimes... But if it does, a sniper would have killed me in 1/10th the time with no chance for me to counter play it
---
Yeah same

Blind Well should be opening up for everyone come Oct 1st with Shadowkeep. Till then your stuck on those quests.
---
Once I get enough money I cant wait lol
---
For exotic weapons it depends on if you have it (and tried it and don't like it) you can get rid of it. Though I keep hearing that some weapon types like Scouts are supposed to be getting a buff so I'm not too sure.
---
For armor that also depends on whether you like a particular exotic in addition to what perks are on that. If you have something that has perks that don't go with whatever loadout you have those should be trashed or possible used for infusion fodder.
---
Yeah, found my way over there. TY!
---
Lag doesn't work that way with projectiles. The reason lag shoots through walls with hitscan weapons has to do with how lag compensation is handled and the fact that this games (like most fps games) netcode favors the attacker.
---
If the attacker sees a hit and it passes sanity checks and matches up with the server's rewind based on how old the packet is, it counts as a hit.
---
Dumbfuck OMG.
---
Nope I tried it in private games. The proximity explosion is the most op thing. Hunters can dodge them but not warlocks and titans.
---
And I'm sitting there thinking, he didn't even talk about the Sunbreakers, the Shadows of Yor and Shin Malphur, or the origin of the Vex yet.
---
I don't think this game handles projectiles that was. Lag favors the attacker for hitscan but the defender for projectiles... At least in my tests and based on my understanding of typical netcode
---
Again save multiple days. Not just 1 day as that missing bounty on your Titan isn't gonna make or break. Inturned in 8 or 9 bounties when I got mine. Can't get that in a single day.
---
I love more then this game lmao. It's just that also has new content coming on the first, so it's a toss up on what to play.
---
I know that's what I do nowadays given the weird shit I was doing months ago like upgrading the Hunter version of the Gemsym armor set (which has no perks) because I liked the look of it.
---
The other review next to it looks like blatant lies as well, imagine being this much of an angry pent up manlet

Classical music now is centuries old. Classical music in Destiny, literally millennia.
---
If the playerbase were dropping so much, why the fuck would we be moving to another platform? Even less people would play. 
---
Did they even play the game at all before leahing that?
---
My heart is starting to melt from cuteness because of this adorable draw.

I am reading about these cheese was patched on July 30th. Anyone know if this is still available to do?

---
So I see the "seasons pass" but it looks like other games versions of a battle pass. Is there missions tied to these that non pass owners miss out on? Or is it like others where XP unlocks the tiers, while pass owners get the more meaty bottom row?
---
Player Levels like 1 - 50 will no longer exist...we are light levels only. Everyone is base 750. We build light levels off of that.

Ah ok. That would make sense with what the other person replied

Do launched on PC about a month after it did on consoles I believe. It goes f2p on all platforms on Tuesday.
---
Just try it and decide for yourself. It's free. Literally no downside to picking it up and giving it a go. There's plenty of new stuff for free
---
What‚Äôs the background?
---
I‚Äôve been trying to think of a way to explain this game to people... now I have the most accurate photo to show them. Top notch!
---
Moon's still haunted.
---
"The destiny community is criticising me for putting blatantly false and misleading information so I'm just gonna call them toxic now lol"

Actually this isn't a glitch. It's an intended action for Louis, as some birds do this in real life.

---
THAT'S IT. YOU,  ME, 10 OTHER GUYS. CRUCIBLE RIGHT NOW. WE'RE GONNA SETTLE THIS THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY
---
Base game with dlc 1 and 2 are free, you can patrol the new areas if you don't own the other dlcs but that's it . Forsaken will cost 25$ on October 1st it comes with the annual pass
---
Is this a personal attack or something?

That‚Äôs it I‚Äôm grabbing my my liars handshake! Fisticuffs time!

---
It'd be nice if they'd spend some time improving their pizza rather than thinking of what new ads they can create. Their pizza tastes like greasy cardboard and that's about it.
---
You can have 17 at once
---
You both are on shrooms or something. You are seeing things. I never said Fortnite is bad. I said its community is toxic. And you are comparing Fornite's update to destiny? Lol yeah Thanos dabbing or just making changes to same map over and over again is better than our seasonal updates.
---
Second of all Fortnite player base are full of streamer wanna be. If streamers play something they automatically play it. Like ninja. That is what you can call Hive mind. Not thinking you are doing, just doing it because everyone plays it and it became more popular.
---
The Pizza Hut around me has a bad reputation for roach infestations. Definitely not the superior pizza. Not real into added protein.
---
 Nah, the Forsaken storyline quests won't be f2p, you only will be able to visit the forsaken locations and do some activities but not the story
---
Destiny 2 is a good vbideo game
---
ghorn is a grate gun for all ages
---
Where though? The Bungie site shows the Forsaken Complete Collection but only shows for Xbox and PS4, on [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) it doesn't show up at all, neither on Steam.
---
On Xbox and PS4 I can find it in the store for 25‚Ç¨.
---
I wish that when you use Sagira's shell it changed the ghost to Morena Bacarin's voice.
---
And then why are you here? Leave and play something else if its that bad?
---
That‚Äôs a great idea actually! I‚Äôll pitch that to him :3
---
It took Byf about 4 hours just to read the lore showing it would literally take days of screen time
---
Wait this is new? I've been doing this for years. The children love it
---
And in mine at 3 AM in the morning on Wednesday :)
---
Shid, u right
---
I know right! I feel the same way you do, especially since I was active during D2Y1. I think the biggest thing that confuses me is; if 3 types of ammo exist, doesn‚Äôt it make sense that you would get all 3? Why would anybody be okay with the game if special was that rare? I‚Äôm not sure he‚Äôs asked himself these simple questions lmao
---
Deadass?
---
Haha he knows, loves it. But when it comes to boss dmg or defeating blockers or taking care of any yellow bar for that matter, he doesn‚Äôt really know whT to do other than shoot them with his crimson or rocket launcher. I‚Äôm sure he woulda loved d2y1
---
Bungie already confirmed that the preload contains everything. Steam only says not installed because, well, you havent installed the game. You preloaded it.
---
Dont know where else to ask. 2 part question. 
---
Will we have access to generalist shell and khvostov without new light? 
---
If no, could I delete a character, remake it in new light with the items and move it over to my d2?
---
Liking a game and defending it is called hivemind. Ok boy. Go play your perfect game.
---
That‚Äôs good to know something can stop it at least lol
---
It‚Äôs been two years.
---
oh no a super in mayhem whatever will you do
---
Cosmo specifically said you had to redownload D2 on steam. Sadly there‚Äôs no locating files to transfer over as it‚Äôs two different sources and supposedly the files are too different
---
&gt;the hand of God

you mean

It's the new explosive machine gun
---
Oh wow i just noticed how it had a drum box i thought it was a scout rifle.
---
Thanks for the help! Appreciate it. Guess i will be reinstalling lol. Glad I got 1.5tb free :D
---
There is no only the difference of platforms, but also those are different versions if the game (forsaken on battle.net is too different from shadowkeep on steam)
---
I tried to copy files but yea, nothing happened
---
Man every game out there is killing Destiny huh?
---
They will stay, as will pinnacle weapon quests.
---
The Truth quest has a req for strikes with a 100 power handicap, so that might get harder, or possibly easier, when changed in Shadowkeep as they are removing player made modifiers.
---
Now every hit you do does 7777 damage.
---
I already am playing other games, but so am I playing Destiny. I am not a slave to 1 game like all the fanboys. I like to play it from time to time, I am just not blind to the truth. I mostly play when new dlc's drop like most of the player base, and then it's just having fun with friends not the game itself. 
---
Calm your tits, you are overreacting.
---
RTX 2070 and a 8600K @ 5ghz, just to be clear, I'm saying that the game runs good not because my pc can handle it well, the game uses the pc hardware in a good way
---

Post buff Bad JuJu, or thorn. My year 1 comedian shotgun that I buffed through every season because it had full auto and stupid range and my Zombie Apocalypse WF47
---
Jesus Peter Dinklage voice kreygasm
---
Meh
---
To get the Thorn, you have to kill them.
---
I'm running an FX 8150 and R9 290X so I don't really compare to you
---
Just to avoid any misconceptions: not all DLC is free, you don't get Forsaken which was last year's big expansion.
---
1. I don't care much for the story, but I find the campaign pretty fun to play.
---
2. You can keep three characters at once and switching between them is very easy. You can also share loot between chars, although if they're of different classes only the guns will be equippable.
---
Oh man, I forgot about the comedian. I had a Praedyths Timepiece that just destroyed in crucible. I just loaded into the tower. There's actually a lot of guardians here.
---
Grenade launcher users did all the work for you.
---
Seeing the TF2 icon just makes me happy.
---
We're not sure! I looked around a bit and didn't see anything.
---
My guess is that it would be account wide.
---
In Jokers Wild, the Synthesizer wasn't across all chars and people got frustrated. So in Opulence they made the Chalice account wide and they said they were happy with it.
---
I second this
---
1.3 kd on console congrats you‚Äôve peeked kiddo
---
Duel*
---
F2P is the base game game + Year 1 content. 
---
Forsaken is b2p (year 2 content) And shadowkeep is the newest dlc also b2p
---
You only need to buy foresaken and shadowkeep all of the content from both season passes is free I believe.
---
I would vote that as Helpful. Thanks for that.
---
If you make a new character it will make you go through the new intro mission, yes, however there's no need to delete a character just for that, it's been said that the new starting mission will appear in the weekly heroics rotation so you'll be able to play it even if you are not a new player (: Also, since khvostov and the generalist shell are white/green items they might automatically unlock for you in the 'leveling' section of your Collections.
---
There is a new thing called ‚Äònew light‚Äô I think and it gives you 750 light and the annual pass for free so you can experience all the old content before you buy things like foresaken or shadowkeep
---
That‚Äôs what you get for solo barraging
---
Using a net limiter u are?
---
My thoughts exactly lol
---
I messed around with it a bit. Got nowhere. Deleted/uninstalled of battle.net and download (preloaded) on steam
---
I dont intended to play till Shadowkeep so didn't bother leaving it installed on Battle.net
---
You give people the ability to share their opinion and some a##holes ho and ruin
---
This is just a shitpost reviewer that posts that review in every single game. Don‚Äôt take everything so serious m8

Yeah apparently the RoF is like 120

So, light is like the new currency? So all I get is currency?

Thank you
---
Haters gonna hate. Bt who cares Moon‚Äôs haunted boys.
---
Which cpu cooler do you have?
---
Oh wait its less than 200? Sorry about the vague numbers since i never kept track. I guess it would be even lesser since i jumped in later than feb. Thanks for the details!
---
Wait a couple of days and it won't matter anyway. Levels will go away and you'll be 750 light.
---
The wait is killing me although I‚Äôll just use the time to stock up on groceries, clean the house and take one last bath for one week straight.
---
Man, I remember when the Manannan SR4 Scout rifle was one of the absolute best weapons in the game thanks to its explosive ammo, that feels like a lifetime ago. I really want to see Scouts rise again.
---
But it's a lamer version of the one that was posted a few days ago.
---
If you're looking for reasons to not listen to what this idiot of a curator has to say.
---
They have shit talked:
---
Path of Exile
---
My friend Pedro
---
Risk of Rain 2
---
DOOM fucking Eternal, before it was even released.
---
This guy is a bandwagon rider by all definitions of the word, except he also sometimes goes against the grain and denounces universally loved games just to get a rise of the community.
---
Go to raid report.com and see how many clears you have! My buddy got it after 54 clears.
---
Wow really? But I'm level 31 rn. Will it still happen?
---
I‚Äôm sure that Izanagis would be a good pick for invading right? It could also function as a dps weapon as well, the ability for easy 1 taps is too good to pass up I reckon. Atm I‚Äôm running izanagis with recluse and swarm, it‚Äôs working well when invading and not. Super wise I‚Äôm using bottom tree dawn blade (because duh lol) for invasions primarily, like you said.
---
Hahahahha! Thats encouraging. Thanks a lot for the wish. I believe yes one day i would be able to get it for sure! Just got to keep trying!
---
Every character that isn't Light 750 will be exactly that once Tuesday hits. All new characters made after Tuesday will start at 750.
---
So just do what I'm doing. Get some stuff done on your max level characters, and just wait until Tuesday to make new ones. Good luck, Guardian (:
---
Nop, i on PC =(
---
Yep two more days everyone will be 50/750. Grab those exotics you don‚Äôt have and any other weapons you may need
---
So people have the weekend to raid
---
Oh OK, thanks, guardian
---
I fucking hate when people write reviews and talk utter shite.
---
Cayde states that, because he means he'll never consent to another reset.  Given that, being dead, he could only come back without his consent, his stance on "no Cayde-7" is entirely moot at this point.
---
I honestly don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth it. If it comes with two emblems what‚Äôs the point? I never used the chalice one from the first collectors edition as there were much cooler ones out there
---
It‚Äôs low effort compared to the games you‚Äôve developed right?
---
So basically 750 is becoming LVL 1 in ways ? The new starting point to level from
---
Raid clears means ful completions, i.e. if you quit right after riven it would not count them.
---
Wait till shadows keep all your inventory will go to 750
---
Kind of annoyed with people copying cayde. There are so many of you. Would it hurt to be original for once?
---
*moon's cocked*
---
Haunts Gun
---
How dare you not upload the whole trailer. Now I have to go look it up.
---
Copying cayde? The horn looks good ok
---
I wish I could take credit, but I just saw the pic and being a Destiny addict the Bad Juju just came straight to mind so I thought I'd share!
---
And people will still call them hard drives
---
Now I wonder if marvel really just stole the scene where thor thunder punches the ground to the immigrant song from this trailer
---
Congrats! Prestige Levi took me a while to complete as well
---
You better help it with all the nightfalls, I know I would if someone did that for me. Congrats.
---
Number 7 and the horn are a dead giveaway. Plus the face type is the most similar to Cayde's.
---
I've found that I've spent a lot of time learning to avoid the odd things that'll kill you
---
What about the number 7, it‚Äôs cayde-6 not cayde-7
---
my brother said you still have to buy foresaken
---
I didn't get it on battle.net on time so idk
---
I too enjoy a good warlock bout
---
Exchanging slowvas eh? :D
---
This was my experience this season, minus the fabled part. I had a few good games in a row. Win/lose but climbing. Then it was just blocks of OEM strikers. I think I matched into the same 4 stack of them 3 times in a row. It just completely killed any drive to climb. 
---
However as you‚Äôve proven, I do believe it‚Äôs possible to nail the grind. Just takes a lot of perseverance.
---
the low capacity ones.  a 1tb SSD is still like 80$-100$
---
Around 1900 is where I stopped being able to solo queue as well. Finally managed to push past it this season.
---
I guess I‚Äôm off-meta at the moment for Crucible; I run a Snapshot/Drop Mag/Explosive Round Trust with a Snapshot/Drop Mag/Kill Clip Blast furnace. Apparently it‚Äôs taboo to run two primaries but the combo works for me.
---
we still use hard drives.  they are one of the original storage methods that are high capacity, and cheap at the same time.
---
I like it a lot but it‚Äôs ugly af
---
***I‚ÄôM ABOUT TO ELBOW DROP YOUR THRALL ASS THROUGH THE MOON, AND UNLEASH THE THUNDER ON YOUR ITTY BITTY WORM GOD!***
---
Tbh i feel like Division is much easier because i know the missions to grind. In destiny there isnt much of a do this mission or that mission. Plus if we lose out shit and have to regrind im fucked because i literally will lose all my friends who play because they hate grinding. I have to do most of the lifting when we play.
---
To blow up the barrier crystals by shooting them ? Yeah
---
i saw there will still be the bounties, but i don‚Äôt think they‚Äôve stated they won‚Äôt cost the eververse notes you get from leveling up. so you would be limited based on that. if they are for sale for glimmer or shards, then it‚Äôs game on
---
so...dont play 2/3rds of the classes in-game?
---
Getting kills done for various other weapons. I got my Recluse earlier this season, got my Luna about a month ago, and finished off my Mountaintop last night.
---
The next step is grind out my kills for Not Forgotten.
---
While we still get the pre-load, PS4 users will have to fully copy the game as with all updates/dlc.
---
Shoulda saved that luck until shadowkeep lol
---
I‚Äôm just saying my personal counter to it
---
Austringer Jotunn and usually a curated bad omens.
---
You can either get the new supers from forsaken or shadowkeep.
---
Yeah :D
---
No. Forsaken is a separate expansion you will have to purchase if you want to play it
---
I'm doing solo comp now for shits and giggles. 
---
I'm at 2700pts, and the giggles have mostly stopped.
---
You can't get the forsaken supers for free with new light.
---
You can only get them by buying shadowkeep or forsaken.
---
So i need to buy either of The expensions for access? Is there a bundle or do you need to buy each of them seperatly?
---
You're right, but i think shadowkeep is worth it still WITH forsaken will be amazing
---
We're not aiming for the moon
---
Separate. No bundle. Forsaken and shadowkeep are separate expansions. The supers are available in either of them.
---
Wasn't saying it isn't. But saying Hardee buy a pc cuz lifespan is just stupid. You're paying more for upgrades to your pc throughout the years than I am for a console.
---
Found both..... gotta say I‚Äôm a bigger fan of the plaque by Zavala.... very minimal but effective, I like it
---
still better than having those in a QP match, it's only 1v7(or like 5 next week), not 1v11
---
Right on, makes sense. Thanks for explaining!
---
Yeah I would say that‚Äôs one of the most visually stunning things I‚Äôve seen in this game and yet we can only admire it from a distance. 
---
Such a shame because it‚Äôs just begging to be *__RAIDED!__*
---
This is the only BR game I play because of this type of thing. I just enjoy it because the gameplay feels like Titanfall, and it seems more polished because of it being made from AAA devs.
---
I think they should change this dlcs name to chad o'kefee
---
Funnily enough Dust Rock Blues is the only thing I‚Äôm missing for the forsaken collections badge.
---
And I don‚Äôt play much Menagerie so I haven‚Äôt unlocked the right runes to get it from there.
---
This is the inside of Jurrasic World pyramid. Duh.
---
Me and the boys going to the moon
---
So true!!üòÇüòò
---
I know I said that, they will be stuck at 750.
---
I have AMD, too, but I'm telling you, a bad CPU with screw with you. My graphics card can run the game several times over, but my CPU bottlenecks it and I get ~40 fps in high pop areas
---
Forsaken will be on the Steam store on October 1st when Shadowkeep launches
---
..which happened all the time in D1, even late game. Also, nowhere dus Bungie state that WoL have a higher buff % than Well.
---
I hope. I enjoy scout rifles.
---
Yeah, similar to that.  But with the Bungie polish added.
---
connection based matchmaking, quickplay should not ever have skill put into the matchmaking
---
Wait are we not keeping sparrows and other eververse items?
---
OP you do you have this image without any text on it? :)
---
I come here to help people not witness a murder happen, Haha.
---
they‚Äôll still be available from collections, but they won‚Äôt dismantle for bright dust
---
Will the ones in our inventory be taken?
---
This thread is going in circles, so let‚Äôs leave it that. üëç
---
Or different variations like the one in crotas end
---
Thanks to my clan I was able to hoard hundreds of enhancement cores. Get a good active clan and play on all characters, that will do it. Also complete banshee bounties.
---
I know you can shoot grenade launchers at the people below you and it‚Äôll kill them but I‚Äôm not sure that this was the case here (might‚Äôve been but i was below so I didn‚Äôt see) next time you go down that shaft try using a nade launcher lol
---
I like this better than Bad lol
---
&gt;Never needed to my kills have been fast enough
---
&gt;considering ***I*** haven't heard it until the very last day of the Season I'm going to assume it's not any more effective than anything else
---
Uh huh. And I'm the one who was trying to flex?
---
That was a cute little backpedal though
---
But usually they die on the spot and don‚Äôt spin like that, when this happened I broke out laughing just because it was so unexpected
---
Couldn't do that :(
---
Lol *respawns at last checkpoint*
---
Are you using them on constant basis?
---
If you have finished the forsaken campaign, go complete the quest from Benedict 99-40 in the tower. That will unlock the menagerie and get you some 690 gear. From there just have fun until downtime tomorrow :D
---
100 gigs on the hard drive and counting
---
I absolutely LOVED that lost sector the first time I discovered it!
---
same here, quite a shift from the aesthetic from the other places. Pretty, Mysterious and best lvl design imo
---
The fucking cz is overpowered in every game
---
I usually run EPs with a mars ghost for exp and glimmer so I can dismantle any drops for shards or gear I buy from Ana.
---
For free marketing?  No.
---
Same, powerful gear and black armory weapons (x2)
---
Alright? You clearly need to crutch off something if you can't get to fabled then
---
Nothing is happening to old pinnacles
---
I wish breakneck had a bit more range. It isn‚Äôt super great at some of the larger maps in gambit, but it isn‚Äôt terrible. It‚Äôs add-killing capabilities is almost second to none.
---
Thanks, I'll try this.
---
No, it's your Shards of Galanor. Mayhem increases charge rate + Shards increase charge rate = super over, and over, and over
---
There should have been multiple messages warning about this if you started Destiny 2 recently - and yes, https://www.bungie.net/7/en/PCMove
---
I'll be repairing my old van for sale, doing a bunch of winter yard prep, and some fall decorating.  Sucks I can't grind Menagerie on my day off.  üòè
---
15 is max.
---
Probably didn‚Äôt notice the warning signs but yeah I looked up the move. Thanks for the info
---
I wish more music like that played in strikes and raids. It was super fun having music blaring in the background while mowing down some meaningless adds.
---
Yes I‚Äôm late. Lol I can not play often and am trying to catch up. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòÅ thanks for the info.
---
Hah, imagine actually having achievements
---
*cries in BNet*
---
Also, my upload speed is around 100. Which is what it always is. And changing regions didn't work. Guess I'll just have to wait until tomorrow and check if I can play by then. Thanks anyways!
---
r/brandnewsentence
---
He is recommending Cyberpunk 2077, but not recommending Witcher 3???  He is not recommending Divinity 2?? I think his reviews are based on top  sales and then he checks the trailers and decides from that
---
Sorry forgot to type that too. It shouldn‚Äôt give that that much of an increase though right? Normal PvE requires 7+ ads before you even get 1/2 - 3/4 super back
---
Isn't Savathun one of them? Think we've already gotten to fight one of em
---
EDIT: Savathun's a witch. But if memory serves correct, don't we fight a sea worm at some point in the campaign?
---
black armory is a cool way  but i've a very bad luck as it seems to be trolling me and giving me always the same weapon i already have on each type (hand cannon,pulse rifle, etc) goddamnittttttttttttttttttttt LOL
---
Anthem memes are old af, but this still made me lol.
---
Too bad master of arms gets nerfed :(!
---
Real talk though, anyone actually think that Calus can end us on the spot?
---
It's funny because it's true
---
100% would play PVP for this.

If you've got a question concerning if a roll you've got is good or not, try /r/ShardItKeepIt !

yeah cus we busted in right before we shot him, cayde wouldn‚Äôt notice that nahhhhh ofc not
---
Huh. I am on pc. It already exists. But from your perspective I guess it makes sense
---
Am I right in thinking consoles don't get pre-load?
---
I loved Advanced Warfare
---
Then I just got really lucky I guess =)
---
*did you love the PtW Supply Drops?*
---
Yeah...there's a reason I pretty much only interact with my friends and clan and no one else. Though I've been lucky enough to get some nice people in LFG when we need one more person for a raid, it's not a risk I take often.
---
ü¶Ä Bungie wont reply to this meme ü¶Ä
---
New light players can go to the moon my guy
---
You can't transfer the game files. Sadly, you're just going to have to pre-download the game on Steam.
---
yeah, you  can still play on all platforms, it's just one account. He could play on Warlock A and Hunter B on PS4, and then get on his PC and play on A  and B as well.
---
Shadowkeep is offering quite a bit, I'd say if you have the $35 to spare, it would be an excellent addition to your Destiny 2 experience.
---
Oh okay
---
Okay I just thought they couldn‚Äôt cause thats what they did for previous dlcs
---
Is it actually not recommend
---
Probably not. He doesn't have the power of the Light, nor the ability to actually kill a guardian iirc.
---
Yes, this was said 7h ago.
---
It's all good, there's a whole list on what new light players can and can't have without buying shadowkeep
---
Where can one find this list?
---
Search "Destiny 2" on Steam and select the free-to-play option. It's currently only available for pre-load but it releases same date as Shadowkeep (next Tuesday.)
---
(Unless you play on Xbone or PS4 in which case idk. Pre-load's still available.)
---
Forsaken and Shadowkeep are both independent DLCs, you don't need to buy/play one to fully experience the other.
---
Im sorry im gonna keep mine..
---
A brutally efficient grinder that is still heavily played in SPITE of itself and not nearly as much for the sheer experience of jt.
---
The hero we need
---
You hunter could be at 500, doesn‚Äôt matter because everyone is being bumped to 750 automatically at launch
---
It will be when shadowkeep launches.
---
So, in your opinion, they are balanced as they currently are? Not too powerful in the slightest?
---
D2 player here. Really excited about punching Crota in the face. This useless, Vex bringing piece of shit. EVEN YOUR FATHER IS ASHAMED OF YOU, CROTA. EVEN NOKRIS WAS A BETTER SON!
---
like, i get the first 2, i don't get the last 3, is this just about releases dates or updates or something?
---
This is no place for call of duty
---
Wouldnt technically ghaul be a guardian already and we dont know about it ? All you have to do is Die or be killed and be light sensitive (assumption). For example Uldren was killed by us and we knew he was light sensitive from the cutscene in forsaken ... and who killed him ? Ghaul also showed signs of light sensitivity infact he obainted the power .. then died to who?
---
Lmaoo I recently returned to destiny and this was me for about an hour and a half during my first leviathan raid.
---
Dredgen easier
---
I did it with Shinobu's vow, bottom tree arcstrider, suros regime, twilight oath, and some heavy I never used
---
I‚Äôm actually working on Dredgen currently
---
Bottom tree nightstalker is getting a bunch of changes to make them usable in pve and pvp. It seems they‚Äôre going for an invis/grenade build for it.
---
Get fucked neeeeeeerd lmao
---
In the mission that ends the Ace of Spades questline he explicitly states he doesn't want to be brought back.
---
Yea since gambit is matchmade its alot easier and soloable where as wayfairer is alot of rng and knightfalls
---
They very clearly stated that there is a 90 day wait time between cross save activations. It is to stop people from getting ‚Äòrecovs‚Äô even easier by letting someone link your account to their device, get you the thing you want and then you pay them. This is widely looked down upon in the community so it makes sense.
---
Yup, he's a titan.
---
It‚Äôs him versus millions, we win this one tbh.
---
But fuck that crushes my hopes.
---
Right now what you own will transfer over. You can buy Shadowkeep on Steam now. Forsaken will be able to be purchased either immediately after or soon after Shadowkeep/New Light open up on the 1st.
---
Switching from PS4 to PC for the first time once shadowkeep comes out. A friend was telling me that I needed to first buy shadowkeep on PS4, then enable cross save, then buy shadowkeep on PC. Do I need to do this or can I just buy it on PC since I don't plan to play on PS4 after I go PC?
---
Meh was on tractor canon duty. It wouldn‚Äôt have made a difference anyway as actual da,age starts after hands and head.
---
Also just got my fifth! I‚Äôm never playing mayhem again.
---
I'm not sure, probably above 720
---
They said it's the same d1 map right? But also bigger
---
‚ÄúSuicide is badass.‚Äù - Danny Devito‚Äôs last words, before becoming one of history‚Äôs greatest Titans.
---
Isnt calus minitool+mida multi giving little more speed? ^^
---
That is the official D2 companion app under the fireteam tab.
---
"I have a story but I want you to pay" I can't believe it...the Darkness was Activision all along....
---
(Also, fun fact: The OP admitted it wasn't a bot who wrote this, they wrote it to sound like it was written by a bot. Meaning, they're just that funny.)
---
True true. But if you knowingly hit 69 next season, you can‚Äôt play for the rest of the season. KNOWINGLY though.
---
I love the random deaths tho!!!
---
It's not just Gambit, it is PVP in general. We have weapons that are designed to rip apart trash mobs/bosses with ease and we use them on players that have like 200 health. 
---
Destiny would need to add a massive set of rules and balancing changes specific to guardian damage otherwise PVP aspects will always be unbalanced.
---
We lost a composer to this commercial
---
Damn, $100?! It's only $60 here in the US! Not sure how Freedom Bucks converts to AUD, but that just sounds far too expensive for a DLC. I'd just wait for it to go on sale or something. That's what I did with Forsaken, and I caught up relatively quickly. Granted I was on holiday, and had nothing to do for the first few days.
---
More like "Oofie my grades..."

There literally is. He stopped breathing, turned pale, and died. He then came back to life from a ghost

Oh sorry, you're right.

We know the child was revived by a ghost. There‚Äôs nothing that ever says Shin was that child
---
While I love both game series I consider it a grave sin that you haven't touched BL3 yet.
---
I dont get why people think blade/shards is worse. Tether literally closes area of the map, yanks your aim downwards, cancels your abilities and super...
---
Hell yeah. Less than 48 hours to go.
---
Good bye easily offended projecting person.
---
I kinda want one of those scribes to have kept an actual account of what happened when Calus was forced to leave the empire.
---
Thanks friendo
---
Ugh
---
JK, welcome to destiny! Nice to see a new Blueberry come into the game!
---
Right so are you 100% sure that if I dismantle it now I can reobtain it with shards?
---
Nah, he's all talk. He's got no real cabal left to do anything, that's why the Leviathan is basically a decrepit shell of it's former glory.
---
It's all a show - a facade. Not to get political, but Calus, in my mind, is not much different than a well known political figure in the US, albeit much more tolerable.
---
I loved the first game but it had its day, time for this to evolve further newer enemies not based off of ones we have seen
---
Destiny 2 bringing out that Big Wick Energy
---
?? ... disrepectful to the cat?
---
My wife was always the fire team leader when we played, I even tried having her load in without us being in a fire team because I thought that's why she wasn't getting Cayde in her game, maybe it was just a glitch that stuck idk. My theory was that you're not to get the treasure maps from cayde anymore so they just took it out from everyones game to keep people from starting a new game and going back to stockpile an item that's not really in game anymore.
---
Would you be interested in selling yours after seeing this post? Keep searching for one....
---
Yes.
---
Like, on Bungies list of priorities this one is pretty low fam.
---
if you dismantle it now, you get/ can reacquire it with Bright Dust. if you wait until after Shadowkeep launches, you can dismantle/reacquire Eververse items for Legendary Shards and possibly Glimmer
---
Hold up is d2 gonna be down Monday if so shit there goes all my grinding for redrix
---
‚ÄúPart time cowboy, fully time dead‚Äù
---
oh dont worry, im switching to synthoceps/dunes   
---
i found out theyre more fun to play with
---
I support this. If you tweet to them then you will probably get a reply.
---
So if I dismantle it now i get bright dust and will be able to reacquire it afterwards with shards right?
---
Idc. 
---
MOON'S HAUNTED
---
Wait, you work at Bungie? That‚Äôs awesome
---
Gold yet held together by tape... ghetto fabulous
---
?
---
What? He didn‚Äôt change anything to the art
---
&gt; MOON
---
Pepega Clap
---
that is correct, note that Bright Dust will only be available via bounties from Strike/Gambit/Crucible bounties (unless i‚Äôve missed something)
