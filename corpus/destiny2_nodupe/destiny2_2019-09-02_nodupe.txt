Beautiful

I do the same thing when Huntards camp heavy
---
What are the forges?
---
Personally, I have found Forsaken to be worth it, but if you want to wait and see how Shadowkeep compares you can do that too. If you don't play a lot you may not like Forsaken. People who don't have much play time say they find it "overwhelming." I think this is more of a psychological thing, since Forsaken isn't going anywhere and you have as much time as you want to play it. 
---

---
Note that due to D2 moving off of battle net, you won't be able to make any purchases on battle net starting Tuesday. If you have not decided to buy Forsaken (the Complete Collection is what you can buy there) by then, you will have to wait until Shadowkeep comes out and it moves to steam.
---
Needs hours spent every week to perfect the craft, muscle memory is everything in PvP
---
I do have paragraphs written about the golden age and the collapse before this page, but I wanted to share my timeline because it's the part I'm most proud of (it folds out!).  I am aware something like this may be better suited to subs like r/destinylore but as far as I could see I was unable to upload images there, and I really wanted to share my progress with others so far.
---
Of course he's not good he's still playing Destiny 2.
---
Ughhhhh, so frustrating to invade against
---
The nightmares are lesser bosses. One is the gate lord. Raid bosses saved for strikes very likely
---
Oh cool then. And just so I’m not mistaken the leveling system is getting overhauled correct? Everyone’s is gonna be fresh? I barley started getting back into the game like 2 weeks ago and saw the solstice event and some guy told me that would be the best armor and that i needed to grind it to be max level. And i do play every day so i feel like i can get some enjoyment out of it.
---
Sigh. Dmg-04 already confirmed its the raid armour man. And thats not how game design works. All assets would be done by now they would just be fine tuning mechanics/encounters/etc thats why they delayed it. Probably working on the raid too in a similar regard
---
Bag him after each time i wreck em.
---
Except dmg-04 confirmed it
---
What proof do you have of that?
---
From [the FAQ:](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/by457o/faq_shadowkeep_cross_save_free_to_play_and_more/)
---
&gt;&gt;I have Destiny 2 on Battlenet now. Am I going to lose all my progress or have to rebuy expansions when the game transfers to Steam?
---
&gt;No, and no. This will be a gradual process, as stated in the above Bungie page about Platform transfer, but you will, of course, keep all of your progress and absolutely not have to rebuy anything that you already own.
---
Worth is subjective. It is based on how much you play and what activities you, personally, like.
---
Where?
---
Yes, all players will be made power level 750, no matter what point they are at in the game. Source is on the Bungie News page of the official website, in the post titled "director's cut part II."
---
Well, if you’re on PC or XB1 you’ll get three new strikes 
---
How do you know who the bosses will be? Are you assuming Phogoth and Omnigal remastered will be the strikes? 
---
I doubt the Io encounter is outside in the part you probably enjoy least, I’m guessing that the beef, but the new area was inside the Vex structure akin to Vault of Glass architecture. 
---
None of this really mattered though as it probably won’t contain what you want, all new stuff for vendors. I get that. Not really my thing personally, but obviously they aren’t going to cater to just me. Perhaps the development time was more spent on armor 2.0 and the gear for Eris, Vex activity, and universal ornaments. Maybe the vendor reset was a lower priority?
---
im playing gambit 24/7
---
striker titans are a problem !? ? Hammerhead is also not a problem 
---
dunno what you talking  about dude
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/cxrz0v/i_dont_think_we_should_accept_reskins_as_raid_loot/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed. While I do like the way the Omega Mechanos armor looks, I thought the new Season of the Undying vex armor looked a lot cooler.
---
Indeed, a disappointment. But we should move on and learn, and so should Bungie.
---
Then Boston tea party their ass

I bet you run OEM and striker every game too

If forsaken is not owned on your xbox account you will not have access to forsaken unless you buy it on the platform you choose to play on
---
Awesome! Feel free to send me whatever you have to share!
---
So i only have to fear her imagination
---
Oh ok cool thanks! Does anything I do after the swap carry over ? Or are they saving on bnet even after the transfer ?
---
it's a ahame how people bitch about which is better, both have their perks and quirks.
---
*still upset that manual guarding was removed from WF though*
---
I kind of hope it turns out that siding with him was a gamble that doesn’t pay off. He’s annoying and I don’t like Gambit anyway. I want to feel kind a Guardian again. Not some task doing mercenary for NPCs, and especially not a shady NPC like him.

Wondering why he isn't a sugonda

This is a completely unimpressive clip why did you post this. The amount of kills on that clip from that super is really not that impressive

Will do bud!

Alright, alright, alright.

Just get deluxe it's not that much

exactly

yes I'm aware, just admire the painting already lol.

Are the resets retroactive? I have done 4 this season and I’m almost done with the rumble step. Will I have to do 5 resets after the bounties or just 1 more?

That looks crazy
---
fighting lion is primary ammo but it all counts the same
---
special ammo launchers are orewing maul and militas birthright
---
‘One games’ are you kidding me? Troll.
---
It isn’t a cheese by any means, but it does have wall hacks and invis so it is very easy to use and easy to get kills with much like the OEM. (I get that one is and exotic and one is a super. ) Which is the point op was making. However I think if op is going to single out spectral he should also include dawnblade in that as well.
---
Spectral is powerful with wallhacks, but neutral game it is hard to keep up FE, and it has less damage resistance than other supers, but I see where you are coming from.
---
What about the secondary trait?
---
this is something i dont get why dont more pop motes they last for atleast 2 games and in that time you should have gotten another one id rather keep my exotic on
---
Didn’t even think to look.
---
Bruh that thing looks insane (also riven is fucked)
---
You do realize D1 had a battle pass, and that came out years before fortnite right?
---
Guys a douche. Don’t drag another community in to justify it for him though.
---
Next time you get people like that, put them on your "blocked players" list &amp; they shouldn't get match-made into your fire team.
---
All too easy to imagine. 
---
That said, I think every phase of Destiny has these spasms of imbalance.  I do feel like Bungie has gotten better at avoiding the overswinging pendulum of ZOMG too powerful! -&gt; nerf it into oblivion and also making adjustments in PvE and PvP separately. Vex Mythoclast was just the first, and the first that came to mind for me. That one went from stupidly broken to completely meh in about 5 days
---
That much blast radius? Its so big if you shoot it today, it will hit a Riven in another raid next week
---
Not sure why people are being so negative.. is it his artwork? No. He had it “made”.  
---
Looks nice though.
---
D3, dedicated servers and split pve/pve balancing?
---
Its not too common on console ive never been disconnected unless it was purely my internet.
---
Did you not read his comment he said everything else except for crucible. You guys only have melting point for pve. You guys need a buff to your supers in pve.
---
Gonna get those feels like I did in rise of iron or rise of tapir as others remember that day
---
i am the only striker titan i have ever seen in gambit and i use it solely for ad clear, idk what servers youre playing on
---
That . . . looks fucking amazing.
---
I actually feel a little scared looking at it
---
You can look up reviews on all of these things, it has all been released in its entirety. It is hard to say whether you would personally like it or Shadowkeep better, as Shadowkeep is not out yet. The "seasons" in the Forsaken annual pass are smaller DLCs that add some end game activities.
---
Multiple men stand behind a sitting woman.jpg
---
Warlocks have one. Titans have...  One(3 if you count every shoulder charge). Umm, what?
---
Destiny pvp is a mix of rpg and fps elements. Gotta get good guns to do well or good armor at least, or good skill. The Avg guy jumping in from New light has no Idea about the meta or what weapons are good,theyre gonna go in with an auto rifle and ask how they're getting killed by pistols.
---
IIRC it's Darkness Falls or some thing that I've totally misppoken the name of but I'm almost certain I remember that it's a remote detonation that drops bombs.
---
They were gonna bring it back but apparently an issue with it kept crashing the game.
---
No it isnt. The trace rifle is the raid exotic.
---
So I am alone in this world
---
Remember when I got the ship. I said I would attempt solo shattered throne since it was revelry. Got it in the symbols and haven't done it since :/
---
Fuck yeah ok I didn’t read that right. Now I feel sad but it doesn’t matter because I only play crucible and Gambit
---
Were you blinded by its majesty?
---
It's called [Dark Descent](https://i.imgur.com/mwoKYsw.jpg) but that's all I can find on it.
---
Some speculation it might work like artillery.
---
I spent a while looking for the stone mask from JoJo bc I would have been so upset if wasn't there. Wasn't disappointed.
---
It’s so bad ass, I want it very badly.
---
Blinded?
---
Hey op, what is that appearance tab at the bottom?
---
Riven’s been fucked.
---
#In ways you wouldn’t expect.
---
This is oddly uplifting
---
Yeah got no clue will probs find out more once shadow keep comes out because then we can see actual numbers
---
Thousand voices 2 electric... uhh make that void boogaloo
---
You must be one of these mindless blueberries
---
Nice
---
Didn't know this, thanks for the info, always felt like I died super easy in comparison to other classes when using my super(i usually just use GG exclusively)
---
Now this is a design for an exotic if I've ever seen one, wish other exotics had a bit more to their designs
---
It’s basically just for shaders and ornaments.
---
Yyyyyup. The Corrupted Strike has taught me this far too much.
---
That’s the equivalent of black air force 1s he’s don’t care about you his teammates and he don’t care for himself
---
It's not even fair
---
Trostland dregs better watch out
---
Not alone mate. I got kicked from two games in a row while on a 5 win streak and my team won both matches I got kicked from. Then I had to stop playing comp because of the suspension.
---
Awwww good job &lt;3
---
It's cos they are scared of nova warp (killed a spectral and arcstrider in a single burst)
---
I miss splitting my novas into 3 balls.
---
Lol you posted an hour long video. Going to be honest if you think an hour long video on a game is even relevant you need to try and expand a bit, you know move away from the reviewers and twitch. Go out and find the things you enjoy without people telling you how to feel. 
---
If you enjoy Destiny then that's great then go play it and enjoy it. If not then don't. It's really that simple. Don't lead your whole life basing your opinion off of other people's opinions. Back away from the videos and reviews and go experience it for yourself.
---
Do you know what the perks are?
---
Woah, that’s crazy! I never even imagined. What an interesting thing to think about...
---
The triumph is hidden now that solstice is over. You need the masterwork of one armor piece still
---
Take your Trump nonsense and scram off of my video game reddit
---
In mayhem with shards of galanor, one kill refills your super immediately, so it's not even a waste on one person.
---
A bit salty yes but not furious, can't fault the youtuber just trying to make a living using click bait.
---
If I dont have it I cant get the title then?
---
If you don't have the triumph for masterworking one piece, you can't get the seal anymore.
---
I hate I hate everything, I remember this video and it was trash
---
Techies has been added to Destiny 2
---
I love how to most is constantly shifting +/- 5 upvotes as people try to keep it at 69
---
I'm so proud of this community
---
Oh, I agree. I used to listen to the reviewers and took a hard pass on Destiny 2. Then I tried it for fun a week ago, and I just can't put it down. It's a fun game in my opinion, looks great, shooting is fun. Im lvl 30 capped(Warmind) and I just can't see myself buying Forsaken or Shadowkeep. 
---
Most Forsaken shit will be free, and Shadowkeep, so far, has 0 details on what is going to change except new armor, new raid, new location, reskins. 
---
All I see the past few days is discussions on what to buy or skip, and every single topic has either hype about Shadowkeep or (a major problem in my opinion) speculation about what Bungie will change. Meanwhile, nothing has been confirmed by Bungie. 
---
I think, what the guys says in the video, will happen again. People buy it no matter the problems.and rhey blindly skip over them. Most of this reddit will defend it saying that the problems dont exist, meanwhile, Im trying to decide wheter or not I should buy Shadowkeep just to be able to be competitive in PvP.
---
what did you just say
---
If you dont have the legendary armor (majestice) solstice gear then you cant get the seal
---
No idea, I had a similar amount, I discarded over half for brightdust instead
---
Nah,I have 357 kills.But thanks for defending me.
---
....I can't even get 3 kills with it lol (I main Warlock but Hunter is my 2nd)
---
Counter balance on a luna??????
---
found anything on what it can roll on the random slots?
---
Like I said I'm fucking dumb.
---
Gaze upon Saturn, or to be exact, on Enceladus ;) It's where the Deep-Stone Crypt is.
---
Many secrets about exos are around this "Crypt" .  
---
"If the sun over Nessus escapes nebulca cycle, evac labor after dawn, under solstice."
---
I main Dawnblade in PVP. Titans can one hit melee you out of your super.
---
#Wrong.
---
it's Gjallarhorn+Dragon's Breath.
---
Pretty sure they at the very least mentioned they would reduce super armor
---
Nope, nothing confirmed. Its all in-air. Maybe we will do this, maybe we will do that, who the fuck knows, we dont even know. Its a month before release but we dont know
---
To be more accurate Gambit and all locations will be accessible. Forsaken weapons, armour, raid, blind well, missions, shattered throne, all annual pass activities, annual pass gear/exotics will ALL require payment to have so not ‘most of Forsaken’. Also Shadowkeep has lots of info on the changes coming: season rank, altered locations over the course of the season, exclusive season activities, new pvp game-types, solo comp, 3v3 crucible, new weapons, vex offensive activity, dungeon, UI updates. Most likely more as we get closer to the release.
---
The thing to remember is that the game is improving itself, trying out new stuff (armour 2.0, season rank, short-stay activities) and if it does or doesn’t work, bungie is definitely gonna hear about it. People still get the new stuff because they are helping bungie shape the game that we all wanted, whilst enjoying it along the way. Yes D2 started in a bad place, but look at the difference now to what it was. With support and constructive feedback as, a community, we can continue to improve it.
---
I hoped to cut the tracking but it still got me. One can dodge an arch bolt grenade so it does somehow work..
---
This is probably where they blew the art/design budget for this expansion.
---
redrix broadsword
---
I think you can shoot Dawnblade straight up and like a f*cking "Javelin" it will go straight down if it finds a target.
---
I mean no doubt I watch his videos, but the way OP is doing is from the very start to the very finish (at least what we know is the finish). Where as Byf jumps around from topic to topic. I’m also caught up on D1 story; just want a full package.
---
Looks like redrix broadsword
---
Redrix broadsword
---
Wow super fast thanks
---
Is that lingling? I wander if it hits Japan
---
that is cause bungie hates hunters and always nerfs them and once hunters find something good all the titans and warlocks come crying again, yet when hunters complain bout warlocks and titans, bungies buffs them instead
---
Well I’m gonna have nightmares.
---
nice repost dumbass
---
They said their not nerfing gls at all
---
They’ve already confirmed no GL nerfs in SK
---
It won’t matter, it’s just there to contribute to your overall power level.
---
Wow, a mustache genuinely works on Ikora.
---
Sorry you havent been enjoying it man.  The changes coming seem pretty big, maybe not y1 to y2 in D1 big but maybe hop back on in mid october to see what you think.
---
That looks sexy 👀
---
I got mine in 2nd run 😅
---
The only thing that’s going away is the irl seal pin or medal you can buy from bungie’s store once you get said seal. I believe it’s season 6 and before.
---
Well, then I guess I just need to figure out what to equip and get used to the pace of the game mode
---
Very well, better get to it then. Thank you very much for your help!
---
I had a match when i:  
---
\-Had to wait for solid 7 seconds after the respawn cooldown because game looked for a better position to spawn me at  
---
\-Spawned in front of enemy with super twice (wasn't a Striker tho)  
---
\-Got ambushed by 3 freshly spawned overshielded enemies.
---
Lol these comments!
---
It looks like a crow glowing purple with its mouth open
---
True story: I was doing that all day long with the little Gambit tokens they were giving away.
---
Happened to me in Gambit Prime. No weapon though, only shaders and blues.
---
I've been tempted to play anthem again but everytime I think of the crappy loot drops I just stick with destiny
---
Now...gotta get that SunShot catalyst.
---
Destiny has like twice the amount of players that warframe has, and is about to have more on october
---
Borderlands does it way better and is a way better game then destiny anyway
---
After seeing my friends in D1Y1 struggle to get good exotics cause of abyssymal drop rates, especially gjallyhorn that I was lucky to buy instead off of xur, its just a dumbass system
---
Look at how many people bitch about 1k and anarchy, and if they buff tarrabah, people will bitch about not getting it too, yes those are raid exotics but it shows how much people hate having to pray to rng to get one exotic
---
And all those people who don't have to peregrine greaves, shards or liars handshake and just pray everyday but don't get is just funny, what's the point of a looter shooter when the best loot is hidden behind an abyssymally small chance that takes months or even a year to get
---
I'm not saying to go full quests only or hand them out like candy like they did D2Y1 but these drop rates suck ass
---
And don't go "they are exotic they need to have low ass drop rates" if an exotic is only exotic because of its damn drop rate it failed as an exotic
---
Aka most exotics that are like this anyway
---
No problem. Good luck, guardian. 😉
---
don't we always have at least 3?
---
Mines working. It is on PC but I haven’t checked on it for an hour.
---
Those aren’t even kinda close
---
The biggest nerd in this photograph was the guy behind the camera, I assure you :-)
---
I did every single bounty and only got two swarms lul. Sadly I got a ton of orewing’s but no concussions /:
---
That is a good point, I know the NF was needed but do you think it could kill me still?
---
Pretty sure that was about MT and Wendigo. But yea I still guarantee you they will get nerfed even if Bungie initially says they won’t. They saw us all using WotW, now they see all of us using SotR.
---
There’s some people who go round with the lower light level but then power back up once they’re in and keep the round going until the other people get kicked.
---
It’s like destiny’s version of SJWs.
---
Me too, and yet each one instantly recognizable at the  Destiny cosplay meetup they were participating in.
---
Just trust me bron
---
When you stare into the void and it gives you a boner.
---
Alright, fair enough.
---
Some very dedicated players completed the chalice within a week. 
---
How it works is you get most of your imperials from the Nessus barge chests, the Calus robots' weekly bounties, and the Menagerie triumphs. Then Power and Efficiency 2 is for extra grinding once you've done all those things.
---
So you edited your post? Lol. 
---
The difference between an exotic quest and exotic activity is only in your head. Either way, yes, I'm totally fine with a small amount of random exotic drops.
---
I'm not playing Iron Banner! I've play the list on the left and on the right. 
---
Yep, I guessed that would be a problem with the amount of hits it takes me to finish someone. I always aim for the chest 😅 Hand gun to the head is what I'll try next, I think
---
Yes the problem is only can play in the weekends, so is hard really hard to Get
---
Fucking Jotunn
---
Wait! Beards are coming!?!?!?!!!?!
---
You turned Ikora into Payday2 Sangres. You can add that to your resumé.
---
So doing one event for an exotic isn’t different from doing a long list of random tasks? By small amount you mean 1....you probably should be playing a looter if you don’t actually like looting the beat weapons. You need everything handed to you don’t you? lmao
---
Hunter if you wanna be OP in pvp.
---
Yeah I know that. Just saying since you get the boost, you're not going to have to grind to level 50
---
Orewing’s Maul is decent. It can ohk unlike fighting lion
---
This.
---
Did this all the time in d1, and it was great, but in d2 it just doesn’t feel the same
---
Fighting Lion will get you Wendigo easy, but Mountaintop, I don't know. Those multikills are brutal.
---
Sorry but "cool" and "Zavala" are mutually exclusive.
---
Unlikely; they probably would've done so fir shadowkeep  if at all and there's been no news of such
---
Titan and not because of crusible reasons, but because strike/reckoning/menagerie modifiers.
---
As a titan you can play best into them. Blackout/grenadier = doomfangs, middle tree void and 5 nade mods.
---
Grounded/brawler = peregrine.. the destroyer of worlds
---
Devrim
---
All things considered, is it *really* that big of a deal? Sure it sucks and is a reskin but it still looks cool and theres loads of other content, not to mention the amount of people that will be playing that werent here in y1. Personally, Bungie will have to fuck up a lot more to get me unhyped for this expansion
---
I see this all the time so definitely yes, to be fair as much as I want to hate I can't. There is no reason to grind comp hard or to stay up there in rankings, they thend to get bored and end up doing this or running sweaty in qp.
---
thats BS, a single titan can carry a whole team in the menagerie.
---
I was in a comp match with some friends against a trio of low level. They quit on match point so we sat around with the remaining guy until the round ended.
---
Maul with proximity is probably the most reliable if you have trouble getting direct hits like I do. The best as far as blast radius is an old one from Dead Orbit, Truthteller I think it is called.
---
Happy cake day
---
There's going to be more options for skill based match making, so unless they're in the new classic playlist they shouldn't be getting stomped into wine
---
as shaxx says it, YESSSSSSS
---
Hammerhead, the LMG from Black Armoury
---
Ok, I was just confused. But I haven't really seen a lot of that though, most of the toxic posts are just the bungie apologists.
---
My boi ready to boogie down on the Soul Train
---
The gun he used was hammerhead, a machine gun from black armory
---
When I say I shid on the floor
---
I was kind of hoping to be bamboozled and the clip was of you being killed by a striker titan 7 times in a single super  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Impossible!
---
Grab your armor of light bubble
---
I want heavy ammo synths back ):
---
Thanks!!
---
I’M MISSING THIS?!?!??!!!
---
C’mon son :(
---
I boosted my hunter bc I wanted one of each and figured that was the jump I'd need the least practice with
---
I wish but probably not. Unless there's a new subclass in Shadowkeep or something. Probably not gonna happen
---
With a shitty shader and some blues
---
Other than some foul language, I assure you it’s safe.
---
Maybe try updating GPU Drivers.
---
*cries in anarchy*
---
Gah!
---
Thanks for your comment. I'm active in a clan system, but I am looking for a specific subset of players. =)
---
I didn't know Pitbull was a Guardian
---
Same here! I feel like D2 raids always have one person who is just ad clear, and noobs end up there instead of really having to learn encounters.
---
Oh god
---
Is the curated actually any good? I feel assault rifles are pretty weak in this game IMO.
---
Tractor + Recluse = melted
---
I don’t think any of those apply to guardians because it could give you an  unfair advantage
---
Is this pic from d1?
---
Well, I'm going to the translator to know what guns are those (I'm Spanish) 🤣
---
Jokes aside, thank you very much! The temptation to shoot to the body because is easier is too much tho... Gotta put the time into it
---
PD: I think everybody is trying to tell me something about... staying with the team it is? I'll try to figure that out 🙄😂😂😂
---
Thanks, everyone!
---
I hate being in the process of spawning and already being shot.
---
It’s always Jotunn
---
I laughed too hard at this and the other one similar that I saw
---
Im so glad that I get to see your picture lol
---
Yup
---
i'll consider you comment. i have two weeks left to pre-order the expansion (because after the 19th of September i'm busy) and one month until the release.
---
If Bungie,in 2 weeks,will not provide some serious improvements aside from the same things,then i'll wait until two/three days after the release to buy it
---
I need bleach
---
* Name: perfect
---
* Appearance: unique and scary
---
* Damage: well,100 of blast radius is enough to say that this weapon will be used for DPS on Raid bosses
---
Yep,we found the best exotic of D2 Y3
---
Its infested with fallen
---
Totally justified emoting.
---
I think that Rasputin is sending his weapons across the Solar System for the Mars Challenge.
---
Y'now,300 millions of Hive killed are a little bit too much.
---
Ah someone here’s from the glory days
---
Wrong sub buddy
---
I've been doing pretty damn solid lately with top tree stormcaller, blast furnace and hero's burden. I very rarely grab power ammo because it seems everybody loves to camp it and shotgun your face to oblivion. Been averaging 1.8ish kd in iron banner but losing matches because zones dont matter I guess. 🤷‍♂️
---
Entirely untrue, please stop spreading misinformation.

Just finally got the shotgun as the last of the ikelos weapons, feels good man. Now I just need the helm on my hunter and to *hopefully* grind Osprey tonight and I'll have my first title.
---
I read this in Winston's voice from Ghostbusters
---
No stop this pls
---
Buy dlc or rather... *JOIN USSSS*
---
Jonny Depp
---
Huh?
---
Indeed.
---
Yeah, I'm on my third week of checking with him and they've been the same. Hopefully this week it changes.
---
I hope not it’s time we get new guns
---
Thanks for ruining Ikora!
---
The one from the forge
---
No

Will the new light stuff only be available to kinderguardians?
---
with how shitty the state of pvp is right now either the crucible team got fired or should be fired
---
All you gotta do is get a 2 win streak and then go queue for iron banner as soon as you see it change from 1/12 back out
---
Like some pornstar handlebar mustache would be great, you should redo aldren with a hitler stashe since hes the bad guy and all, idk how well people would enjoy that though
---
Sometimes this happens when your pc gets too hot, its called thermal throttling
---
I still use it to this day. It’s one of my all time favourite Destiny weapons! 
---
Inaugural address is a solid replacement, Y1 raid weapon - useful for most content
---
Thanks
---
Screams still echo those corridors
---
I always carry that with me. I’ll give that a go too.
---
Whatever makes the game work is not working very well. Is that a server? Im not sure.
---
Look i get that you’re upset. It’s justified to be mad at all this monetisation. I want you to keep in mind that shadowkeep is the first project of standalone Bungie. The team worked very hard to put this out in only a couple of months. I’m glad we got so much improvements and a dlc on top. Also if you don’t like it, just don’t spend your money on it
---
I didn't know about that, that sounds way better than an emblem.
---
Have they announced what gear is being added?
---
if i don’t own destiny 2 and buy the standard shadowkeep,do i get to play destiny 2 and the first two dlcs right now or do i have to wait for the 1st of october?
---
It’s correct that when you turn in your IB token after you completed the quest you’ll get gear but that gear are Y2 gear. When Y3 comes with Shodowkeep the gear is going to stay Y2 they will not ever be 2.0 gear. If and when Bungie have a new IB in the next season we can sadly assume that it’s going to be 2.0 but we don’t know if we are going to be able to use this IB gear as ornaments.
---
I got them all but they will be irrelevant in a month or so even if you can still use them.
---
You know it’s bad cause I’m scrolling through Reddit waiting for the game to load right now
---
It has peer to peer connection. So it is just bad internet buddy.
---
I dont see a problem with having someone rank up for you as long as you finish the quest steps yourself
---
All you need is a 2 win streak and then just load into tower and then back to orbit and then back to tower until it's complete.
---
Or do some other activity. I cheesed it, accidentally, by doing shattered throne.
---
Oh yeah. God roll, dragonfly and rampage.
---
Maybe. Or we can get them out of collections.
---
It could also be an alternative way of getting easy enhanced perks that become hard mods to get in shadowkeep.
---
You can also go into the queue for Gambit and back out. Still need to have the 2 win streak behind you though. Just worked for me this morning 👌🏻
---
I went for the head.
---
Sometimes you get players who you wish actually were afk so you could feel better about their contributions.
---
So it’s like in D1 when they gave everyone that Orb of light that automatically made their character level 30?

Hunters are far worse than Titans. Anything that can turn invisible, take cover, and reload all at the same time is broken.
---
You seem like a good time.......🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
---
We are actually keeping numbers above 50 and our rules are extremely soft, that's why i am strict. There are two major things for which you can get banned - being late four times to a scheduled activity for which you signed up OR for not participating in at least one raid per month. So you can see those who fail to do *that* are definitely worthy of a ban (unless they have a valid excuse like going on a vacation for the summer or something like that).

Kindled orchard or nation of the beast
---
I switched to PC from PS4 too. I got a Logitech g600 after using a mini mouse for an embarrassing amount of time and it’s making a HUGE difference. The crucible feels so different compared to console but it’s starting to click for me.
---
Trust
---
I appreciate your feedback.
---
No the one shax gives you has polygonal, high cal rounds with a stability MW. If I'm correct and it's not the best roll what so ever. As a matter of fact I sharded it as soon as I got it. This is the roll I've been grinding for for a while it covers literally all of the weapons weak points being range and stability.
---
Might make sense with season of the undying since he has been in the black garden before
---
And hits like a dump truck
---
Thank you I’ll try those
---
I’ve been trying to get a good roll
---
If u like 180 than a good trust is your go to. Otherwise i recommand a good nation of the beasts or kindled orchid. both 140. notb is from last wish and ko is from the forges.
---
Did you just feed shaxx a bunch of crucible tokens?
---
Al right
---
I yelled " RANDOM GRENADE THROW HOOOOOO"
---
Basically yeah...
---
The fuck
---
I am so bad at reckoning I can’t even clear T1. Is the gambit prime drop rate considerably worse?
---
And it's just one guy karma whoring
---
This demonstrates no knowledge of balance
---
Chunky milk.
---
Source pls? I dont remember this. I'm probably dumb
---
You’re right, I still don’t see people talking about how SK is a DLC with four seasons, RoI was a DLC alone.  Everyone is comparing a years worth of content to three mos...even with that SK seems to have more to offer.  Armor 2.0 will change how we all play, cross save is already creating a whole new game for those switching from console or to other consoles with friends...let’s just put the pitchforks down and wait a couple weeks.  It’s not like Bungie can add anything substantive between now and when the game goes gold.
---
Nah you're fine lol I just know it's fun to make these kind of memes. I actually don't pay attention to what happens in Crucible since it's not worth being upset over a game I enjoy.
---
Yea. And we work it like it’s prime, every person on the team has a role. I somewhat of a jack of all trades where I can wreck adds AND collect or invade (if need be).
---
Bit of a Gravedig but Lethal is actually in my clan my man! We flawless Scourge together twice! Weird to see both of you in one place.
---
Im a proud sweat Lord, but i will tty my best to guide blueberries when i can.
---
The universe brings great guardians together in weird ways.
---
Yes
---
I've had this problem before. Turned out to be a bad connection down the street.
---
The Bungie post regarding Eververse changes
---
You dont have to buy shadowkeep to get the patch tomorrow. You know that right? Your post makes it seem like, to get updates, you have to buy DLC.
---
Yes it is. But there sometimes triple valor weekends. So u will get 30 points for a lose. And then the easiest way is to play comp, because a win in comp increase the valor streak and lose does not kill the valor streak so. So u will gain about 120 valor points by a comp win (with a 5 streak)
---
Quite fond of fond, myself
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
If you want to play like a power crazed ant smashing maniac go with a Titan. If you want to play as a finesse acrobatic killing machine go a Hunter. Ultimately, you probably will have 3 characters at some point. They are all fun to play with. So just pick one and eventually the other will come around some day.
---
OK but what if I'm a titan?
---
No, you clicked the wrong icon, forsaken will always be available
---
The way Bungie handles major game updates they drop it with “expansions” or new seasons. Still have a month to deal with busted supers but oh well. I’m gonna assume bought forgotten can take a super out anyways bc it’s just that good. All the for the low price of somewhere between 25 and 800$ amirite
---
But they can already two burst right now
---
How TF are you moving that fast?!? I run a 10 mobility Hunter, and don't move that quick in my super...
---
Matchmaking would be a nice asset going into Y3.
---
Who is that supposed to be? I don’t understand these memes at all.
---
Satisfying
---
Is it this one? https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/47935
---
The way I've seen it, the major game updates come a week or 2 before the new DLC. This one is coming a month before due to them pushing back the new DLC.
---
Ah,  the Brakion break. 
---
All or nothing,  because everybody gangsta 'til the Vex start walkin
---
I agree, what they should do, as making it a heavy would effectively kill it even if they buff it, is make special ammo a thing you have to seek out (like in D1) and they would help a ton as people couldn’t just spam it for a few easy kills every life.
---

Hunter tether is by far the least used PvP super in the game. It’s just bad. I use in it QP because the utilities are fun but the super potential is awful. It has a 1.2 second animation with a 1.5 second activation time. So even if you get the suppress, there is like a 90% chance they you’ll die to the super and then they will get suppressed. You have almost 3 full seconds. Beyond that though, I was only using tether because it’s at the opposite end of the spectrum, bottom tree striker is a crutch, full stop. 
---
If you play high level comp, (3200+) you play against hunters or specifically ONLY OeM bottom tree strikers, whose only tactic is to lose the first round and then chain supers for the next 4 rounds with 5 super mods. They will lose every gun fight and still emerge with a 5.0 KD purely from super kills. The devs even acknowledged this with the shadowkeep changes, talking about how every qp match is not complete without dying to at least 1 striker titan twice from the same super. After shadowkeep drops, A LOT of titans are going to have a hard time breaking a positive KD because their brainless playstyke of “straight line the single opponent w a shorty to proc OeM and then spam melee super” simply won’t work anymore, and I cannot fucking wait.

Great, am I missing out on anything buying this so close to the new one coming out?

**HEADSHOT!!**
---
Kindled orchid with kill clip and rampage
---
The crucible team fucking sucks, over a year and shotgun stompees are still dominant meta
---
SUROS invites you to take the high ground.
---
mountaintop fits the clip better but you see a lot more jotunns in the crucible
---
yeah the issue is i think that would let luna be too close to NF in capability and NF really should be significantly stronger than lunas, but i do agree with not having drop mag. Also i would be down to lose mag howl and zen moment if im being honest, both hot garbage perks now
---
damn, feels bad. defending against a dawnblade does take quite a bit

Deadass if they do a crucible pinnacle auto I will shit my pants
---
It's a pretty specific one, and likely not an easy one to fix. They made the boss hit two phases at the same time and the game makes both phases happen at once because of it. You're only options (that I can see) are to prematurely make him immune for a period of time while a phase begins to stop players from melting him too fast, or to add a new clause that renders the previous phase disabled as soon as the criteria for the next one is met
---
So I haven't played destiny in like a year and was planning on playing again when the new update drops....s...should I not get it?? All i see is posts on how terrible it will be for new players lol
---
Mind writing up the rolls, dont know the icons by heart lol
---
I really like how the Braytech Winter Wolf looks. I wish we had a gun that shared the model but with year 2 rolls.
---
Striker annoys me, since it heals and gves back super on each kill, especially since they've removed these effects from other supers/exotics. I could deal with either one of those, but not both. Maybe split the two effects between the two Fist of Havoc trees?  
---
Recluse is less annoying. Still annoying, but not gamebreakingly so for me.
---
He looks like the emperor of mankind
