Congrats man out of curiousity what was the ‚Äúhardest or more painful‚Äù part for you.
---
For me I had everything done but needed 40 more hvts
---
Well there‚Äôs not much to do like you‚Äôre looking for before they go on sale. I don‚Äôt know how often they‚Äôre on sale but when you buy them you get a consumable increase to PL500 and you do what a i said before. For things to do until then, nothing will affect it once you use that seed

Anthem has potential and I do enjoy it's gameplay, but I also really enjoy Destiny. Destiny is a solid game that has owned what it is, while Anthem and Bioware clearly are still trying to figure out what kind of game they want it to be.

Yooooooooo we share the same Cake Day Brother! :)

Congrats on the power level
---
Ofc I did. I only speak facts 
---
I knew i had two pieces!!!
---
If I see blinking motes, imma pick em up no matter what. If theres nobody else around after my nova imma grab 15 and sprint no matter what.
---
This is why you aren't getting better my dude. Stop blaming the matchmaking system and take advantage of it. The only way to get better at comp is reflecting on what you can do better, and then making a plan to do so. 
---
Chromas?
---
Plus in lore states toland was pissed when the guardians killed oryx that they didn‚Äôt take his place of power 
---
Nice!!!
---
Not really. The whole point was to reduce the gap between casual and hardcore players. Casual players now can get significantly more cores, whereas hardcore players just have to find other ways to get them. 
---
Like yeah it's annoying for hardcore players, but matterweave drops relatively frequently, you can get cores from clan stuff, you can buy cores from spider, and you can always just buy a bunch of simulation seeds from spider and hope for good RNG. I disagree with their removing the current scrapper bounties, but their whole patch isn't as bad as the more vocal players tend to insinuate.
---
Someone sent me hatemail trying to tell me that I bought my unbroken title lol. I dont know how much that would cost, but shit I do not have the money to pay for that

I'm an adult in college and my parents still "expect" me to eat a family meal, at a dinner table, at 6pm sharp every day. Shit happens. Be patient. Unless they take more than half an hour then it's free game.
---
Oh yeah i remember that, i didnt like thosr
---
Why?
---
They all have the same drop chance. Reaper medals drop from killing HVT's, getting Massacre medals and from getting Thrillmonger medals.
---
should I just take a photo of the synths I have to show you the problem?
---
[removed]
---
I prefer minimalistic looks tbh and the neon colors turned me off
---
k1lo should take not of this
---
Forgive me, I was absorbed in thought.
---
Fair enough but I still think it should be an option for people who like it
---
It should most definitely cus the armor all lacks rn 
---
Agreed 
---
Rip siegward onion knights have the most honor &lt;3
---
I didn't get to D1 till taken king I didn't know that
---
I understand the idea but i think some guns should only be for the few who get it the hard way. I don't have luna, never will i hate competitive.  Also know that i out gun people with luna in the crucible.     Look into tge service revolver the right roll make it a great hand cannon. 
---
If you have more of other synths than reaper that means you're not playing the reaper role objectively not that RNG is bad. I have about 5-6 stacks of each.
---
Well it drops according to your play style, i have alot of reapers and hardlt anything else
---
Still something fun and new to do. OP wants content, not gear. 
---
They most definitely are. People just don‚Äôt realise it. Comp is meant for the elite or those pushing themselves. Fine have a sub playlist of comp that entails what I said then but forcing people to use something less favourable to show off there skill is something I feel a competitive playlist should have
---
I wish!

Vanguard dare, from Tess last season. The whole set is really cool, it‚Äôs essentially Cayde‚Äôs armor.

Except useful lol. Unless I'm in shotgun range I can't get a kill with it, and might as well be using a shotgun anyway
---
Finally got the effing Rampage mod , lol.  What do I put it on , Breakneck or Bygones ? 
---
It‚Äôs not a huge challenge compared to Souls games, you recover a resurrect charge after one deathblow as far as I can tell. Which, yeah, you can resurrect. The bosses are much less braindead, and the dodge mechanic is more like Bloodborne, a quick dash with few i-frames. You have to parry a lot if you really want to keep the pressure on enemies, which isn‚Äôt too hard if you‚Äôre used to the genre.
---
Boi what that tongue do?

Vanguard dare boots and the shader looks like crucible metallic.

The voice acting and animation is usually what did it.

I just need a cloak now, which Is ironic as I was complaining about a day ago that I was getting too many cloaks.
---
I mean, I'm no expert, but I've gotten 3-4 since friday
---
I think that is hopefully going to be a thing now. And I in the same boat doing it all inn my titan. Have to trade those patrols for much easier purges on that quest.
---
Literally had no idea this was a thing 
---
Nope. I didn't either. His incompetence killed him.
---
Different person here, but do you get other synths in the middle of a game? You can only have ONE synth drop during the game, based on what you do, and then a random one drops at the end. So for example, if you get an invader synth early on in a game, even if you do the things that give you reaper synths later on, you won't get a reaper synth because you already got a synth during that match. 
---
there's a new raid coming next season iirc, if the requirement is &gt;700 you can use the boost to enter immediately. but yeah, its not a very useful item overall

Just picked up ds3 and passed this dude. That stupid fucking "oh ho" -ing made me think he didn't have anything to say so I went down the fucking elevator as he actually started his dialogue and I missed it. Ofc when I go back up Mr. armored stay-puft is gone.

Literally last week everyone in my clan including myself re-installed D1 and started new characters. As someone that never played any of the D1 expansions, I‚Äôm very happy. We also noticed a very high number of people with low grimoire scores as if starting fresh for the first time! Pretty cool! D1 is still alive and well

This isn't an entire removal of the resource though. Just a removal of one part of one system.

"Infusion allows you to drastically skip the grind of re-earning the gear at the new power cap"
---
What grind is being skipped by having infusion be less costly? Easy infusion does not equal easier or faster progression. Players still need to earn the powerful drop, of which there is limited amounts of them per week.  Being able to infuse easily does nothing to allow me to skip any grind, it simply allows me more flexible choices in what I use as I progress. Infusion is lateral progression, not vertical. When I receive a 675 drop, and use that as infusion fuel for a piece of gear at 650, I haven't now gotten two drops at 675....I still only got the one 675 drop, I just now was able to put it towards something I actually wanna use. 
---
Nobody wants vanilla D2. I wholeheartedly agree. 
---
See everyone brings up OEM cause it was like literally the only useful Titan exotic. Also OEM wasnt as bad as people made it out to be. I have gone against so many kids that were using OEM that were just straight up bad. Like OEM makes good players better but does nothing for bad players. Unlike Wormhusk Crown from way back, that thing took literally no skill and made bad kids good.
---
At least you'll never have to do it again once you're done
---
This seems random but I saw your post from years ago saying the "3ds c-stick was stuck in a direction" did you ever fix the issue? because it's happening to me right now. I kinda fixed the issue by pushing the c stick numb in the system in the direction.
---
except you could easily just save up your prisms each week if you didn't like the items and then easily have six stored up and get all six items in one matrix.  They were great and gave a reason to come back each week for those that hardly ever played the game.  Now there is no reason cause you have to do a ton of grinding to even come close to getting enough bright engrams to matter through normal leveling.
---
No, because you still have to be a lower light than your kills to progress.
---
Yea seriously, Hunters have things like Gwisin Vest and Shards and we have turds like Stronghold and Kephri's Horn.  Meanwhile Hunters are running around with Infinite Tether and Warlocks are running around pelting novas at everything every 2 seconds. While Titans just sit there and watch.
---
Now I fuckin told y'all that I'd have to eat in an hour and a half. And yet y'all still take *30 fucking minutes* to all get online and get ready, then y'all have the *audacity* to dick around too much.

It ain't *my* fuckin fault y'all's a buncha fuckin idiots who can't get don't by the time my momma finishes dinner. And it sure as hell ain't my fault I was raised to eat my dinner with the family.

You can use 1K Voices. You can one shot each night and it takes about 4-6 hits on the Shreiker. 
---
You shouldn't lose as much points or any at all if people quit and you lose. 
---
I know the meta pretty well, and I'm pretty much forced to play it due to my arm. I run a service revolver with rangefinder kill clip, critical sass, and wardcliff. I basically cant play up close, so ive learned how to counter flanks really well. Its just that heavy ammo defines most matches, and I'm not good enough to contest the spawns. Maybe I'm just not physically able to do it, and I should stick to quickplay
---
From an editing perspective, the lighting in the Scorn cutscene would really undermine the tone of the song. Maybe, "Show Must Go On"?

In PvE, WoR has completely supplanted it. In PvP, it's still great to cheese countdown matches

Hmm fair point

Just tested it, the two buffs cancel each other out. The game will only consider you having the effects of the most recent one used.

There was enough room for both of us in that pussy

Yeah, bloom is Bungie's failed experiment. Man, if they ever get rid of it. Try a Duke with KC/Opening Shot. Two tap headshot (121 to the head!) 3 tap bodyshot. With Sureshot &amp; Range MW &amp; HCR your opening shot proc has above max range. I could have have Rangefinder &amp; Accurized instead, but the flinch from high cal is nuts and two tapping people is just too funny (I also 1 head 1 body'd a 0 Res warlock, had to do a double take!)

I thought they started removing them along with loot posts.

We are here for the memes, not for such common feats.

But why?
---
Well, too bad then. Got the Lens a few days back and was pretty hyped. I think I'll take it for a spin nonetheless, thank you!
---
You hit legend at 12000, then you get to Max Infamy at 15000, which is where you reset.
---
Those 3000 are probably the hardest since there‚Äôs no Infamy points for losing. This is where you rely on anything that gives you points: winning streaks, daily/weekly bounties.
---
I can‚Äôt confirm how it works but I somehow saw getting 25 points for losing Prime matches but I am not sure about this as I was completing bounties also at the same time.
---
You‚Äôre almost there.
---
I thought I was going to reset  infamy before getting all this Envoys and Primevals done - that was an insane grind. But finished those first and I knew the reset was just a matter of time.

Good luck!

Okay thanks

No it's nightfall specific. 
---
Jotunn is OP. It should NOT one shot while under the effect of an Iron Burden,  it should NOT one shot a notorious Invader with the bonus overshield.  
---
It brings the exact same problem as Sleeper did in Gambit,  it has way too much ammo,  way too much power,  way too much range,  and the most violent tracking in the game - it absolutely needs a damage nerf,  it SHOULD still one shot in PVP and Gambit but NOT against full-notorious Invaders and especially not while 100 light levels lower than everyone due to the Iron Burden
---
Nice, I got i 3 times and my clanmates didnt get it once
---
It also has explosion on impact and burning dot on the ground. So if your mate was hit near you, you still get damage, it just ridiculous.
---
Yea, was meant more like ‚Äödon‚Äôt farm tier 2 and get frustrated‚Äò
---
To be fair, it‚Äôs a good idea to watch a Datto guide before doing it, but saying you‚Äôre good to go is bull
---
He's one of only a hand full of true heroes in this game and so, naturally his story is a sad one...
---
Was really surprised when I went on last night and saw a random from my clan on too, wish I had someone to run around old d1 with been messaging the new players asking if I can tag along for the first reef cutscene

is the inverted spire challenge difficult? would love to get that ghost there

Wondering if I should attempt it or save myself the tilt. I'm not that good - 1.5ish player atm. Only have one other person to play with that I know so it'd be a duo at best.

I read all these things about getting to 2100 in about 6 to 8 hours. Is it that fast to climb or what?

Thats also good advice thank you

---
Thanks
---
Bruh what about a belt feed revolver?
---
Execpt for how he couldnt even record caydes last lines before his death.  Left that up to Nolan North.  I really hope there was behind the scenes issues because thats a low blow to the destiny community.
---
Sounds like my experience last night on lfg.  When someone posts for sotp phase 2 kwtd you'd figure they would know what's going on.  Instead it's a group of 5 that have no clue what they are doing with a kid telling everyone what to do incorrectly and assigning roles that don't exist.  So I spend a few minutes and tell everyone what's what and we try but after 4-5 attempts with them dying to berserkers I just nope out of there.
---
Aye
---
The fusion rifle sucks tho
---
People grinding bounties that only stipulate finishing a public event, not a heroic one.  Seems legit to me, unless it's the flashpoint location.
---
&gt; And like many have pointed out as well, if the goal of this resource is to make it abundant and flowing to the point where it doesn't require much thought to having it....does it really need to be there in the first place?
---
Nobody has brought that up because nobody wants it to necessarily be like shards where its so abundent it doesnt matter. I can understand them adding like one more way to get a few more a week. But thats really all you need. Getting cores is very easy to the point where you dont need to struggle like people say they do, but it still requires thought to not just infuse every single item willy nilly. 
---
Cores drop often from dismantling legendaries. (First dismantle today dropped me one) And while I know people who play less will get less legendaries, that also means they will get less powerfuls and need to infuse less. It scales fairly even with play time for anybody besides mostly those who play it for a living.
---
You then have the scrapper bounties. These also drop from getting rid of gear, and can be done usually without even meaning to do them. Theu are pretty basic things that youll be doing anyway for most of them. Now this is a little obsolete now since they are being replaced with Gunsmith bounties so there are guaranteed ways. People want both. I agree. There is a decent chance they will bring scrapper bounties back as they have already said they are looking into it. We'll have to see how gunsmith bounties work. They could be better since they are guaranteed every week. In fact they will be better for players who play less because they earn less gear and therefore less scrapper bounties. They now instantly will have bounties to do it.
---
You also have Finest Matterweave. Yet another thing that can drop just from simply breaking down gear. These drop a core from pretty much the first yellow bar you kill.
---
The good ol' simulation seed trick is another. Vance likes to give out masterworks. I have never done this myself but many have recommend it. Buy a bunch of simulation seeds from The Spider, head to Vance, cash money. Tedious maybe, but easy. Shards arent scarce at all.
---
Another is the new pinnacle weapon trick. Since its tied to a triumph now, its shared between all characters. Pick the quest up on all characters. Then do the triumph for the gun. Cash in on all characters. If you dont want the gun, thats 21 cores. If you do, its 14. Players with less time or those who arent fans of the crucible wont get that one, but the Vanguard and Gambit one isnt an issue. So thats 28-42 cores right there. And you unlock some nice weapons.
---
There are also the wanted bounties. If you know youre going to a location you see, or playing strikes, pick up the bounty related to what youre going to be doing if there is one. You can continue doing what you were planning on and still get more cores every day. Hell, most of the wanted enemies are in lost sectors. On a lot of days they mostly share the same location. This is a decent amount of easy cores fast.
---
You got random curated roll drops too. Since these come fully masterworked, they give 7 cores. Heroic Blind well gives these. Raid encounters can. And I know raids yuck no time. You dont need to do the whole thing. Hell you could do one encounter a day. Checkpoints exist for a reason. These have a fairly lower drop rate but they are still a source that you will without a doubt benefit from sometimes.
---
Lastly, you can buy cores right from The Spider. 10 per core. Doubles in cost every time per day. Depending on your shards, you can buy 1-2 per day easy. If you really got a lot, you could even make it 3 per day but I wouldnt recommend going higher as again, cost doubles every purchase that day. (10 -&gt; 20 -&gt; 40)
---
All of these combine and there is no reason that you should be struggling enough to have it removed. Just do some basic resource management. If you do that and take advantage of all the things I said, getting cores is perfectly fine at its pace. You should be able to infuse not everything without thinking, but just enough to where have to at least put some sort of thought into it.
---
As for planetary mats making it hard enough, eh, not really. When they are one shard, you can buy them in the hundreds.
---
Oh I absolutely agree. I just thought it was funny. Lol. I‚Äôm not saying they‚Äôre garbage or anything.

Can you change the font colour to white in certain areas please?

I currently have a linked friend that I linked with back in Pre-Black Armory. He's on step 6 of the quest, and it's been like that since then. He wasn't high level enough to complete step 6, but he deleted me as a friend (by accident I think) and I have no way to get his battletag, because his name changed. Rip him.

---
&gt;Reply
---
 Imo, making it a heavy weapon would make the gun useless since there are much better heavy weapons to use instead, such as any machine gun, wardcliff, grenade launchers, etc. 
---
 If the Jotunn was to get nerfed, I would either increase the charge time a bit or perhaps make the projectile slower (Which would give you more time to get behind cover, although it may help with the tracking now that I think about it). 
---
Wardcliff will break it in 1 shot. 
---
Make them 160 rpm hand cannons in a new standallne archetype to bring the ttk even with magnificent howl on down a bit and then tune the archetype to balance it between the 140s and 180s.
---
That's why I asked.  Figured it out... 
---
*:)*
---
I did a test, you live longer by blocking lmg bullets with your skull than with your shield 
---
Those things were tanks. My buddy had one with like 650k km on it. 
---
They'd be 3v4, the guy left cause you were afk, could have stayed, but, who knows.
---
Still not a reason to flip out in response, save your own nerves.
---
Welcome back, but there is no requirement of doing the quest in competitive, it literally says 'in any Crucible playlist'. People prefer comp and rumble only because you got more chances of landing the final precision shot, but that works if you have decent skill.
---
Just take it easy and have fun instead. In qp. Or rumble, great place to get a *feel* your character and loadout.
---
No its gone forever...
---
/s
---
Telesto is the makeshift shotgun that can snipe, I'm really not a fan of it. Also, I hate Spectral Blades as well, no worries. It lasts too long and it's so easy to spam the lock-on slash attacks.
---
Me too, I then proceeded to dance while 2 guys kept hounding the one guy that remained. Me and another started chatting, got kicked for being inactive :-/. 
---
650k km?   holy hell, thats A LOT of driving  lol
---
Pretty sure that neck is bigger than my torso.
---
I would also say Tangled Shores 3-in-a-row pod events. While it's true you can get more shells from doing heroic, it also takes a lot longer/more effort, and you'll likely miss one and no one does Heroic on the Hive Knight. So to some it's faster/easier/same reward to kill all 3 in short order then do one heroic and solo the hive knight one.
---
Yep, I just got it last week.
---
It would be nice if they made an additional playlist for those with pinnacle weapons, or if they take that into account when matchmaking to avoid running into a full 6 stack of DR/NF/Wardcliff. It makes it increasingly difficult to make any sort of progress when you're trying to beat players with handicaps like being solo and the lack of said pinnacle weapon.
---
A lot of people are saying gambit is the source... looks like it's time to do a billion and one gambit matches:)
---
Crucible sucks and everybody knows it.
---
If it makes you feel any better, Redrix's Broadsword is ass. Nobody uses it. Might have been a good contender back in Season 3, but now there's better weapons with a lower TTK.
---
Regrettably, in the current meta, if you wanna perform well in the crucible, you gotta play like a pussy until you're experienced enough to be more aggressive. Hold a corner with a shotty or Sniper, run when you're outnumbered. Group with teamates or use them as bait. You hear the sound of a super &amp; it doesn't come from your teamates, don't even bother looking for him, just run from anything that's "red" in your radar until the super runs out.
---
Ohhh okok makes sense thanks
---
It‚Äôs not the source it‚Äôs just happened to drop there. It can quite literally come from anything
---
Yup but I mean that's where it dropped for a handful of people!!
---
Also just a side note. Headseeker is actually good on blast furnace. It allows for a 2 burst with slight forgiveness. It is one of the only weapons that can noticeably benefit from it.
---
He's just a dick
---
Consider the complexity of matchmaking. 
---
It seems that very few people are entering comp solo on PC. The common suggestion is to build a solo queue. What then? 3 stacks become impossible, because that last person will never be backfilled. Duos become less likely for the same reason. 
---
If you want to win in comp, hop on the Discord or LFG and find some people you can be on mic with. No excuses for the PC crowd. 
---
Really, the whole activity should just not be matchmade, or they should bring back trials. 
---
Drop for me yesterday during the weekly dreaming city quest along the Twight oath which the only dreaming city that I'm missing for month.  Also, mine is only 150 speed which kinda sucks.
---
We need more people like you online. 
---
I sometimes do this on fifa when people are getting smashed 6-0 but still trying till the final whistle.  
---
Good on you guys.
---
That's in progress currently, thankfully.
---
I think people are getting used to Jotunn now. Thanks for the advice, I have noticed that one some of the larger maps people are still walking around with hand cannons, just begging to be shot at with a longer range weapon, that seems like the way to go for this step. 
---
Can't give out armor, because that messes with their very intentional loot vector for this update. 
---
It could give out GP guns and regular armor, I guess. I wouldn't say no to another vector for these guns.
---
Depends on the map. In the first Gambit Prime map, I used prometheus lens because the middle well of light was so far away from the primeval. Lens has really good range. But I have been using telestro almost exclusively as special weapon in Gambit prime. It just does so much damage to the boss and clears blockers really fast. I haven't really tried Lord of Wolves in a while.. maybe I'll do that this week. 
---
I would leave if they do that but so far the enemy team has always been nice, I do stay if I am doing any PvP related quests just because I wouldn't want to get a penalty. It is what it is I guess ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
If you are a hunter you have plenty of options to work with, arc staff let's you can do the light, light heavy to kill the spectral. Bait with the two lights then hit the heavy to one shot them
---
Golden gun is a safe option if you trust your own aim. If not blade barrage is pretty fire and forget
---
omg dude please use white text on dark background PLEASE.
---
I see your point. Maybe just better chances of the new weapons would be the solution?
---
*Exotic decrypts into a blue Psi Cirrus*
---
Make sure you do the ones in the exact center on the bottom too.  Most people miss those.
---
Is blueberry a new term for kindergardians? I've been out of Reddit for a while
---
I used to use coldheard for primeval damage but there are a lot more solar shields, especially with medium blockers being captains now. 
---
I don't think trace rifles count for breakneck. I used Cerberus+1 for that part of the bounty.  
---
I would *love* that. I thought they were shying away from the whole two-layers-of-rng thing with Black Armory. It'd be nice if they had a similar system where you could select a gun to work towards, and get a roll on each time, for T3 reckoning or something.
---
What do you mean 5x faster for the big lander and taken blight, those are some of the most time consuming events to make heroic just because of how annoying it is to trigger them. 
---
Good thing is I‚Äôm a slovabomber so he almost never needs to use his super for adds, so it makes for some pretty good synergy. Once I get that first super he‚Äôs free to use his however it‚Äôs needed.
---
It refers to 7 days [here](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/47346), under "New Player Requirements".  Reading it with that context, though, it does now seem that you are only a "new member" for 7 days, and have until then to link to a veteran. So, that puts my mind at ease for now.  Thanks!
---
Fucking embarrassing
---
‚ÄúAh, he‚Äôs doing his own theme music?
---
Big, dumb, and tone deaf. I‚Äôm so glad I was unconscious for all this‚Äù üòÇ
---
Why yes it does. Admittedly this is my first post, so I‚Äôll be more mindful of stuff like that in the future. Thanks for the advice!
---
If you want to destroy my sweater, just pull this strand as I walk away.
---
No I honestly prefer those more. Leaves room for discussion about counters to what is being complained about and you can learn a bit from those posts. This is just "Yay I got ____ finally".
---
Just trade in shards for planet mats, youll be swimming in cores
---
Really? Momento is good but other than that I find the speed of Last word and the damage tick of thorn to be good if not better. I main last word myself and it gets the job done for me. For a bit I was sucking at cruc but figured out that my mouse speed was simply to high stay on pvp targets that arent as predictable as pve. Once I lowered it I got better at landing those important precision shots. 
---
Me when I still get it heroic.
---
My main problem is when you are looking for this exotic. I know get gun suck one I obtained I will put it in the vault and never use it. 
---
Is little thinks that had be pissing me off of the game since the forge season 
---
Mmmmm....
---
I farm cores, and I have around 200 spares after infusing a couple sets up to 700. 
---
On all three characters, I do the bottom left three Spider wanted bounties, for a total of nine cores per week. I micromanage when I dismantle gear in order to maximize scrapper bounties. You can only have three scrapper bounties at a time, so I dismantle gear and turn in tokens to Zavala or Shaxx once I have completed one or two. 
---
The more "hardcore" farm would be to spend all your legendary shards at Spider to get simulation seeds, and then turn all those seeds in to Brother Vance. All planet NPCs give an impressive number of year 1 masterworked gear, which is guaranteed to give cores when you dismantle,  but Brother Vance has the best exchange rate because the shaders he gives can be broken down into shards. 
---
With mouse amd keyboard i just shoot at the max possible rpm while pulling down to control recoil, the recoil eventually makes little difference. Untill you reach extreme ranges, but most boss encounters are close enough. Don't know about console.
---
That sounds like a truly memorable experience :) I bet you both had fun! 
---
What about an icebreaker shotgun?
---
^Oh ^^wait ^^^...
---
Fhat would be brutal on a Zenobia.
---
Gg, I might start using celestial nighthawk when I reach 700. Btw what roll is that transfiguration? 
---
This. The number of times I see players sitting on heaps of legendary shards but also complaining about not having enhancement cores is maddening (not implying that you're doing this, OP) Trade them shits in for cores and keep it moving.
---
It'd be one thing if simulation seeds were some obscure secret, but even a casual search about  enhancement core farms will turn it up, meaning that most of the people bellyaching about cores haven't made any attempt to find out how to farm them.
---
When my teammate pushes me out of the way to get heavy and then gets killed .2 seconds later and then I pick up said heavy üëçüèªüëèüèªüòé
---
They are actually not hard to get, I started on pc at christmas, already have 400 cores and I already am 700
---
Dude! That's a sick option if you done have (takes a deep breath) go figure, blast furnace, chattering bone, bygones, or inaugural address :) 
---
At the moment I‚Äôm not using any because I don‚Äôt have any with high light and my armor looks amazing all together so I just don‚Äôt bother to infuse exotic armor until I get a new piece to drop. I don‚Äôt have any particularly great exotic armor pieces anyway 
---
Sweet. Gonna run it a bunch tonight
---
My spinach puffs!
---
I bet you don‚Äôt even do your own theme music. ‡≤†_‡≤† 
---
They did that already and people complained. People think they're better than most or average but when put into practice they quickly find out they're not as good as they thought they were. 
---
got thorn last night
---
winning games and draining motes are more important than a kill number.
---
I get to 15 invasion kills only because I go after important targets not a kill count 
---
I have the catalyst maxed out
---
Might just be a console thing, or the fact that I don't use it enough to control the recoil
---
The best might be filling up the time ready until it's playable,  at that point you can't start playing the game ad the rest downloads. 
---
My source for that is the ps4 download though,  so I could be wildly inaccurate.
---
Weird science. Thank you for your sacrifice.
---
I hated Gambit and Crucible because I was terrible at them.  I got Coldheart last week and tried it in Gambit... and I was halfway useful!  I've been hooked on Gambit matches the past 3 nights I got to play.  
---
(I haven't tried Crucible again lately but I assume I still suck.)
---
i Still Have mine and i am so happy that i never sharded it 
---
I got a fullbore/drop mag/zen moment/explosive payload/boss spec w/ stability masterwork talons of the eagle during remembrance armour iron banner period but stupidly dismantled it for the cores but now I have a tigerspite and it is great but it's no talons or transfiguration. 
---
Hammer of Sol is the one thing I will always refuse to fight with the exception of the rare Golden Gun pop, most other ults I can actually deal with (shout-out to Sentinel Shield as well, come to think of it)
---
Yeah, 2-3 lmg shots cancels your super, leaving you both animation stunned and vulnerable. Meanwhile you can take like 12 lmg headshots while in your super
---
I'm 99% sure it does not count.  I've been use a trace rifle (Coldheart) and my auto rifle kills are still super low.
---
i got it my first run the first time it was available as a nightfall. since the fix of the boss triumph i ran it once more and got that. i still need one of the emblem variants, but that's pretty low priority for me.
---
I play PS4, and last time I used it (with full catalyst) the recoil was still impactful enough at max RoF for me to not use it over Whisper
---
Believe me I do but like I shouldnt have to use an exotic to make a super good and not good in the way that like Raiden Flux makes Arc Staff better. In a this super can actually do ok damage now kind of way
---
Did they make it so it tells you HOW to make it heroic yet? Because back when I played, I was just gonna shoot shit. I don't know what the trigger is, so fuck it, I'm gonna shoot things. That's what I logged in for.
---
The biggest design flaw with heroics was not making it clear how to do it. Not worth my time to figure it out.
---
Yeah the difference in control methods really impacts the platform meta more tham you think it would.
---
Yea pretty much, not to mention all our Forsaken supers basically suck compared to the other classes.
---
13 Tier 3's in a row with no Notorious Invader boots...  most of that title is pure RNG. 
---
I have been tempted to buy this and the shirt, but postage costs are way to high
---
Oooooh all makes sense now . Thanks . I see a lot low level people don‚Äôt ever go for the ship on IO and couldn‚Äôt understand why 
---
I didn‚Äôt see the postage cost for it yet just saw my price with the code. I‚Äôll probably still get both tho. I really like the shirt it‚Äôs a clean design 
---
In prime map is everything that second map was terrible too may walls and platforms 
---
I just don‚Äôt see myself working that hard for a fusion rifle 
---
Depends on team wave splitter if I notice they are creating a lot of orbs, 
---
Yeah that shirt does look real nice
---
It has instant reload if you swap to another weapon.
---
* Burst large group of enemies.
---
* Clean up the remaining ones with an auto rifle or kinetic weapon.
---
* Switch back to loaded question... it will be all loaded again at 7.
---
* If you have special ammo finder and Fusion Rifle scavenger, and finder, you'll be good.
---
which subclass?
---
Holy hot damn that was a nice shot
---
I keep getting big out bags
---
...it‚Äôs been 500 years...
---
There's a Fusion rifle connected to the triumph, but that's it. (And the bounties)
---
bUt OnE eYeD mAsK
---
Wait for xur and spend the 96 shards on the fated emgram and pray to the rng gods
---
Sorry didn‚Äôt read it right.
---
Hey at least it isn‚Äôt the sunshot shell
---
Only place I know of for a guaranteed exotic is xur. Otherwise all of mine have been random. 
---
Anything can drop them, and when I say anything, I mean anything. The chances of it dropping are just pretty much nonexistent
---
Depends on the exotic. Some only drop from raid bosses, many have quests. Any activity that can award powerful loot has a chance to drop an exotic. Landscape has a very very low chance. 
---
It's just a time spent thing.
---
You realise Dredgen has nothing to do with EP right?
---
woke up the traveler
---
Here‚Äôs something else to make you sick:
---
Liar‚Äôs handshake beats synthoceps.
---
I remember the first week Xur had it, everyone started calling the crucible Lazer Tag.
---
Do you have Prospector?
---
Actually yeah I do
---
Ophidian Aspect would like to have a word with you.
---
One hit titan shoulder melee!
---
Thanks, I hope you get all of the exotics you want:)
---
It's a tad small. 
---
And now I want a video of you jumping through the portal lol would be movie of the week I tell you
---
It's literally no different than a regular roll with enhanced reload.
---
As for the "melee" aspect of it; if you're in melee range against anyone in crucible, you're dead or dying.
---
‚Äú...because that‚Äôs how reading works.‚Äù ‚Äî Bojack Horseman.
---
Umm potentially that has merit, but that would take over as the whole concept of comp. Using a scout against a luna or smg against a shotgun or fusion is all about positioning
---
I need 'em Geomag Stabilizers, haha.
---
let's see what we got here!
---
\*snaps finger\*
---
You're all dead!
---
I'm right with you on the zero cores and lots of garbage I don't want to use in my vault.
---
THANK YOU
---
I could never figure out where the last ones were.
---
**Usually if i do EP it is because I am working on a Black Armory frame or working on a catalyst.  I assume that is what they were doing.**
---
Heroic public events are RNG. 
---
Long days and pleasant nights fellow Tower junkie!
---
I say thankee 
---
Going a bit way too far there buddy.
---
Thanks bro üôèüèº
---
agree, maybe  a useful perk for Warlocks, useless for Hunters imo though and doesn't seem useful for a Fusion Rifle, particularly one that's meant for PVP....
---
I got this chart from /r/CruciblePlaybook, apparently it was made by Bungie:
---
https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/115/115844/09272018_IB_Power_Curve.jpg?cv=3983621215&amp;av=3336650040
---
How's your sister?
---
People say everything but the flavour of the month is dead.
---
If it's not #1 on twitch it's dead. /s
---
thx :) 
---
No worries bro
---
Other players, or blue dots on the radar.
---
Yea it sucks. But hey, most of the time we‚Äôre just trying to get our bounties done too. If you really want someone to respect your role choice then it would be a good idea to LFG a team or play with your clan. Sucks, but it‚Äôs been that way forever. Gambit bounties have gotten better about screwing the win for the sake of banking that 15 shot (for example), but still, I‚Äôm sure people would be willing to accommodate you in your role to some extent, but we‚Äôve got goals too.
---
Once they get bungo to nerf everything, they quit because nothing feels power enough
---
Some of those requests are well thought out and reasoned, be they right or wrong. The rest are people who just aren't good at Destiny and think the game should be re-tuned around their skill level instead of taking it upon themselves to get better at the game. The latter are saddening and frustrating to see.
---
Yes same. 
---
Yes I know that.  I only mention it because most of the Dredgens have played just about every activity in the game. I'm 2 weapons away from 'Wayfarer', I hardly ran any EP's but I still know how the mechanics work! 
---
I think PvP is the only place balance is truly whined about. What I find crazy is that if you find an exploit in PvE, Bungie will get on that shit relatively quickly whereas it takes much longer for them to address imbalances that people actually complain about.
---
Hope that's a joke, because no they aren't .
---
(I think) It's less about wanting to nerf things and more about having less reason to use something, or more reason to use something else. Bungie is also perfectly capable of balancing things differently in both PvE and PvP, but for some reason they tend not to. But the current state of PvP is unfun, nobody likes being spawnkilled by the same Spectral Blades or being one-shotted by a Jotunn in gambit (with the full Notorious Invader set and the overshield!). I don't enjoy nerfing things either, but some things, in PvP only, get too absurdly strong, and, in PvP, should be toned down. I do not support nerfing PvE damage or viability, though.
---
Bungie needs to make exotics harder to get they said....
---
It will be fun they said...
---
Destiny needs a hardcore mode like CoD, weapon balancing is unnecessary in that mode.
---
Someone beat you by 3 hours sorry dude
---
Yeah that's possible too...I got my quest step done for Thorn.  I'm trying to get the SMG that drops this week from EP and out of the 5 other players  I think there was maybe 1 other that was actively trying to kill the boss before the timer ran out...
---
Really depends on the raid, but yeah you can expect around 4-8 hours. Have done around 10 hours on Levi before cause of shit teammates so.
---
I want to destroy their lineage... Fo real üñï
---
Always reposts in here
---
While disconnecting and getting DDoS sucks, but "I played crucible and I deserve this item" is entitled.
---
Everyone has to deal with that shit. You're whining on reddit because you're mad. You have the right to be mad, but keep in mind that "I deserve the weapon" is a shitty thing to say. If Bungie gave it out for free, everyone and their moms would have it. it wouldn't be special anymore and not worth getting.
---
I think Bungie should allow you to rejoin games though.
---
How do they know you didn‚Äôt pull your Ethernet cable? I get you said you were winning one so why would you do that but for losing situations it might be different.
---
Plus if you could contest, that would add a lot of work for Bungie to review everything contested. I think there needs to be a solution but I can‚Äôt find a good one
---
&gt;aside from OEM being a crucible prerequisite for Titans.
---
weeps in skulfort gal
---
Or getting a heavy weapon engram on a chance to get a Gjallarhorn so you can finally join a LFG group! 
---
Same feeling when I jumped back into D1 for a good ol oryx and saw one drop
---
I was doing a the Leviathan with friends. Me and one other had experience (by experience I mean videos we watched) and relayed the info to the others. We got it done in just about 4 hours. So you can probably go less if you're good enough. 
---
They should add the Elaine dance
---
I have done all raids multiply times, unless you are really experienced with the raids, you are looking at a good 4-8 hours 
---
Because I work my ass off üòÇ and don‚Äôt need to pull this hypothetical Ethernet cord to win. I agree man but MW2 even had it to where it wouldn‚Äôt count as a loss and that was YEARS ago. 
---
Deserve it if you get there. Got Luna‚Äôs last season, just frustrating now all the super sweats are getting on üòÇ
---
Thanks!
---
Yea, I know there's plenty of people that aren't aware. I just meant everyone on here already knows. Same as the Heroic Public Event triggers, the people that do not know don't come to this subreddit. 
---
Depends how experienced, if you get an extremely competent team, then I would say like 2-4. Even without wiping once you would still get around 1 hour with majority of the raids so. 
---
OP is clearly asking as they have no other form of reference. I.E., they probably haven't done it before. You mean to confidently tell them that they can complete a raid first time out in two hours - possibly one if they're set up with a proper team? Use your noodle for a sec guy.
---
I remember getting exotic boots drop, being upset cos I wanted graviton forfeit and then decoding it into bones of eao then never taking them off again.
