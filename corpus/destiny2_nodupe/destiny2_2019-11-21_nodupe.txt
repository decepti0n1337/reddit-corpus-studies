Goodluck friend

Yeah I did that! And then quickly realized that it was all one coherent statement and I couldn’t help but read it lol

Blues and the dismantle button

Best part is I did it before qwest nerf

Why you gotta do my boy Alexi dirty like that. My mans already been shot don't fist of havoc him 6 more feet under :(

Hard rip.

If you give me like 20 minutes i can join ur game and help you if you want

Gold star things on your destinations map
---
lmaooo ik your pain. soloing hunter was extremely hard
---
Very true
---
Thought he left Sunday night/Monday morning
---
So I have no idea what just happened, but I replayed the Forsaken story on my hunter (the same character I originally played it on) and I recurved the quest for a second time. I suspect this may be due to my swap from PS4 to PC.
---

---
TL;DR: I can play the quest twice on the same character.

Running Truth as an invader is the dirtiest thing I have done in a video game

Your a godsend. I have NO idea why they would stick that there when it's a damn combat command thanks broski
---
I find blade barrage much more effective, I've learned to dodge the Nova bombs so they hit corners. BB seems to go around corners.
---
They don’t even stand on the plate and get sacrificed. Don’t think that’s intentional.

If you sign into your bungie rewards account over at Bungie.net you’ll be able to find out.
---
the only challenges I have are in the Tower and in Moon, but for the moon I need to have Shadowkeep, do they reset daily?
---
I had that step complete from a weapon catalyst drop at the end of a strike recently when I was doing it the second time. As for exotics playing activities with a lot of yellow bars (escalation protocol or gambit/prime) always seems to drop exotics for me
---
You’ve definitely moved the game from your previous storage to your SSD?
---
I believe the speed test was something like a 60% speed increase, which is just crazy.
---
You spelt Nova bomb wrong.
---
If he's a guardian, wasnt he REBORN cool?
---
I don't see it there
---
Some times looks overrule function.
---
As much as people want to pretend Destiny is / can be a solo game, it isn’t. It’s a social game. You’re pretty much forced to interact with other players in nearly every activity and the outcome varies from excellent team getting things done to raging that you wish blueberries like those you just played with would delete the game because they suck at it, even if they can’t hear you because you’re just ranting to your cat... Ahem... 
---
Matchmaking can be a good thing, but then different people have different objectives that may force you to miss yours because you aren’t working together on something. 
---
The experience is usually much better if you have a team. For that you can LFG and make friends, or find a clan to join and make friends there. You don’t need IRL friends to play. Everyone on my friends list, aside from maybe three people, are people I met at some point playing destiny. I’m sure many came from Kings Fall runs. One is even a very good friend and we’ve played other things together and plan to meet eventually out in the real world.
---
I guess your right I use ugly ass wormhusk on my hunter
---
I did, I got everything but it won't let me collect the Season of the Undying badge.  
---
It's 13/14 done grinded the weapons, did everything on that badge but the season of the undying won't ding.
---

Bug-out Bag is my go to Solar primary.  A good GR/Swashbuckler roll with Drop mag is disgustingly good.    
---

I'm going to miss the lightweight frame of Recluse, however.
---
Exactly

_**Laughs in Nova Bomb + fr4**_

Suffering along with you in matches where teammates push a striker titan camping in a small building with super one by one while we have life advantage and heavy.
---
As others have said, check the badge page. A picture of that would have been more useful than this. You’re missing something. A shader, an emblem, a single gun... if you seriously think you got it, restart the game and see if that changes anything.
---
What sniper is that? Looks neat
---
That entire phrase put me through flashbacks of my losses in comp. A comp-ilation.

Nope does not work

Low effort but I gave it a like

What was your main loadout? I've been running burnout bag and the menagerie machine gun to try to optimize solar kills while also getting machine gun kills. It's been a slow grind though. Wendigo seemed faster.

---
If you enjoy healing perks go for Warlock, tanking perks Titan and stealth perks Hunter is your choice.
---
Used Avalanche, Eriana's, and Bladedancer. (Also heavy finisher, for reasons below)
---
I could've probably optimized with a solar primary and kinetic special instead
---
I grinded it for a solid 2 hours on that wierd exploit on the Insight terminus nightfall. First thing that comes up when you look Edgewise Farm.
---
Handling for beloved, range for ausstringer
---
Did it 3 times for my title, not planning on doing it again
---
Meh, I'm at rank 86 or something so I'm just grinding the usual, took a break for today. Pretty sure imma be burnt out from Destiny and go back to Warframe after this season. Maybe next season won't be as grindy but don't have high hopes... 
---
I got Shadowkeep but didn't buy forsaken as of yet (more cash than I can afford to let go) so I'm mostly sufficed off the free to play and shadowkeep. Sorta do miss cade-6 from back in my D1 days and all the D2 cut scenes.
---
Lmao yep I’m totally stressing over your post and  not making fun of you at all bud

Is it bad that I like zavala?

---
Look for sherpa raids. I completed Leviathan and Garden of Salvation last week and today finished Last Wish (got 1k voices on first chest, gotta rub it on the unlucky ones)  All 3 were really intimidating but they were actually pretty simple once you understand the mechanics.
---
It’s cute considering I don’t use oem because I know it’s to strong
---
Nah, that's related. And that's a delicious sensation
---
Doing the bounties for Zavala (Strikes), Shaxx (PVP/Crucible), Drifter (Gambit), and Banshee etc. are weekly challenges. Just complete 8 bounties for them. 
---
Also, every week there is what's known as a "Flashpoint" destination, this week is the EDZ, and you have to do activities there that include heroic adventures, lost sectors, and public events. 
---
Public events that go heroic are easy to accumulate score with but it's usually quicker to do one heroic story adventure, 2-3 lost sectors, and a handful of public events.
---
These will all net you gear that should be above your light level, and there's also a rare chance you could get an exotic from them. Literally 2 days ago I did the bounties for Drifter and was rewarded with the Monte Carlo exotic auto rifle.

---
Ah ha so thats how you get the sparrow to that platform. 
---
I was on a strike once and someone got their sparrow there. I was legit confused how he did it. 
---
I know you can just summon one mid transit, but for some reason it always decelerated me too much and caused me to drop.
---
I deleted my mind components just so I could clear those from my post master.
---
That’s the kind of teams I get stuck with in freelance. One guy left, 30 seconds, 2 life advantage...hey, lets rush this one guy and piss away our easy win!!!
---
I understand that also but I’m looking at while every other class gets nerfed one class rises to the top and it will always end in majority I hate oem but I feel as if they should add more to increase neutral game for all classes in destiny instead of constantly nerfing classes abilities and exotics
---
Me to.
---
thanks man, I’ve been wondering that for two days.
---
Awesome. Cute as a button.
---
Just gotta off Zavala first, biggest opponent to doing anything outside of the city. Dont even think he would have signed off on granting Eris support if Ikora didnt personally threaten to nova bomb his blue berry ass back to the light if he refused
---

^(i miss Variks though...)

Get Mountaintop next, make a Titan and use bottom tree Striker, hope you randomly get One Eyed Mask
---
It’s the banking of the shots on the second guy, he predicted and targeted three different positions behind cover without seeing his movements.
---
Alot of times on the Xbox community page you can only join if you have 20+ clears or they treat you like trash and kick you out. Its hard to find a team.
---
Right.... so you're totally not running skullfort and using shoulder charge as a primary weapon. And you didn't say anything about shotguns. You definitely slide around the map hipfiring with a shotty
---
I noticed that too but based on the rate I’d give it maybe 4-5 months to completely fix.
---
Just started playing what's gonna happen too cayde?
---
Does it happen to be September?
---
I'm sorry but this reads like "People should stop complaining because I don't think there's an issue".
---
It is confirmed. He attacked because he thought it was leaving the system but he was just leaving Io
---
That’s for the Festering Core strike.
---
Can’t unsee it now

I'm going to need some evidence for this one
---
I can assist you in about 2 hours... if still online and interested.
---
That’s great. I’m glad you liked it. You could have played D1 for free to get this content lol, but I’m glad you like it. People get upset because we were led to believe Activision was such a huge problem with the game, but since they left Eververse is more expensive then it’s ever been, people think crucible is worse then ever, we get a full expansion of reskinned content, and get the grindiest “ritual weapons” we’ve ever had ever though Bungie said they would make things much less grindy. That’s without stating that Xenophage is broken, Leviathans Breath is relatively useless, and none of the armor exotics were even remotely good. Having time with friends is great. I play games with my friends everyday, but to put the stock of a game on the sole idea that it was fun because I played with friends and we had fun playing is absurd. I have fun playing every game with my friends because they are my friends, but we still all admit when some of the games we play are bad.
---
People get upset because companies have quit listening. That’s why boycotting games have become so big. Because it’s the only way they developers listen.
---
That Crown of Sorrows raid when he was basically just a kindergarten teacher
---
This works for 980 too
---
Perhaps I'm a dummy. I've yet to do it 😅
---
When you go to the vanguard icon of the director, the middle left icon is called "strikes playlist." It says this when you hover over it.
---
You can find people to play with using the [LFG megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/bzjpkr/official_lfg_megathread_v_4/) ([or the newer version](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/dudpe1/official_lfg_megathread_v5/)) linked at the top of this subreddit.

I will neither endorse nor shun this statement.
---
Not sure, haven't done it yet. It doesn't look terribly hard, and seems fairly beginner friendly, as it basically has the same 3-4 mechanics in the raid that are used in most of the encounters.
---
honestly sounds like hell
---
he really is
---
raiding is so fun
---
exaclty
---
The literal vanguard strike playlist. It’s on the left of the nightfall ordeal.

You need grenade launcher kills and multi kills in the strike playlist
---
Cool, I really want the divinity

I'll give it a whirl!!! Thank you :)
---
exactly
---
add me too, ive done a few raids but im not sherpa-level. steam: An Exotic Engram
---
Awww thanks!
---
im ps4
---
saving for pc
---
I would recommend Eater of Worlds over Leviathan. It's by far the easiest raid to learn whether you want to just kill ads or actually learn the mechanics.
---
use Destiny 2 Fireteam finder
---
Yeah, it looks like a fun gun. Most raid exotics are fun (well, I only have Legend of Acrius and Anarchy).
---
Will do! I was actually trying to keep him as functional as possible (hence Rigs) but I'll def give it a try :)
---
indeed it is
---
hit me up. Name is An Exotic Engram. My clan is super dead, I need a new home :)

Wow that’s a good point. I didn’t even see it that way till you pointed it out, but it truly does read that way!
---

---
Who thought it would be a good idea to give any class a fusion rifle with a cooldown.
---
Yea that play style is so bad and a lot of them have pride like a mf thinking they’re good 😂
---
sounds like fun. so close to the power level just need to grind a little more
---
so true
---
From what I understand, the Traveler &amp; its power are phenomenons, works of miracles. We only have a fraction of understanding of what it is truly made of &amp; how it works. 
---
The Vex are scientist like no other, expanding in the future &amp; the past as they come to New understandings. They have studied the light &amp; the dark but cannot understand them. There is a faction of the Vex that are worshipping the darkness because that gives them more "power" yet they don't understand the method of how this power is given. 
---
The Vex's true form is that white stuff you see on them, not the metal work. Inside of the Vex milk there are thousands &amp; millions of Vex operating a single Vex unit. 
---
The Traveler has a more mystical basis where as the Vex change things on a molecular scale through their own methods. 
---
Beyond this I'm afraid I can't help you without some of it coming being blurred with what I can remember. I hope I did give you some insight.
---

I came to this page because I’m looking for reasons it’s not working. I just completed the bow one (purple, legendary, purchased with ballistics log) and it didn’t count towards either the Butterly or Giants might. :(
---
What did they do exactly?
---
Phew, I got worried, thanks!
---
Thanks!  I must have not been looking hard enough at the new menus.
---
[Have this image explaining them.](https://static.unixkitty.com/XPXMHkh.png)
---
I’m the same way. For lack of a better term destiny 1 just hit different. I don’t know if it was art style or gun feel but it just felt so much better. Even the quests, getting a thousand yard stare or the sniper from sepiks perfected made the game worth it. Destiny 2 has never felt the same
---
https://wherethefuckisxur.com/
---
I miss the old tower so much 😭I logged into D1 the other day just to see it and look at the difference between game’s , and then I saw what gun I had equipped ...the good ol’ “Nerwins” pulse rifle from iron banner , and had to go shred some hive on the moon for old times sake 😂🤝I loved that gun so much , it’s literally the only “D1gun” I want to see come back sometime lol
---
Yeah I know. It's middle platform which is a mystery. 
---
So far my speedrun ish strat is activate the pillar, time it right and jump in the air, landing when the platform materializes, on the platform with a narrow bit sticking out. From there I summon my sparrow and zoom to the portal. 
---
2nd Platform can't summon, so have to leg it. 
---
3rd platform, summon just before landing, don't hold arrow keys because it can rotate you accidentally, then zoom to the next area.
---
We'll know on Friday! :)
---
He comes around every Friday after the daily reset, and leaves every Tuesday after the weekly reset.
---
Xur shows up on a friday reset and leaves on a tuesday reset. No one knows where he is as of yet, you'll know tomorrow bud.
---
I can get behind the reasoning of not mobilizing the entirety of the guardians into being an army of vengance, that WOULD be too much like the old Warlords. But to condemn even a small strike force to bring Uldren to justice? 
---
To write off the reef offhandedly as opposed to taking any means to secure territories for which the children of the light, humans Exos AND Awoken, may Thrive?
---
No, , that is not a titan any longer, that is a coward, and deserves to be heralded as such
---
https://whereisxur.com/
---
Xur only shows up on Fridays at reset, and he leaves again on Sunday, so he won't be back for two days.
---
Well i think bungie is just trying to remove that pinnacle concept. Cause then whats the point of having such high ceiling for farming these weapons is they are going to be as good as random drops that everyone can have? Its a little confusing for now
---
It was a huge disappointment.  Easily one phased.  Back to the drawing board Bungie.
---
I 100% agree
---
Try it out! :P
---
If none of you have Izanagi's burden u can try to substitute is with Eriana's Vow + Oppressive Darkness
---
And before you go in there give the guide a little look over. The hardest thing in the strike is the Boss if u play it incorrectly if u get that down all good ;)
---
Is there a way to acquire Rasputin Key Fragments other than Nightfall strikes?
---
Ngl when I first heard him say that I wanted Ikora to slap him.
---
Shit I still want my Titan to shoulder charge him then teabag his bitchass
---
The ammo you get from special ammo finder only gives 2 rounds (4 with ammo scavenger as well) but the normal bricks still give the same amount. The bricks look different (they have a more green effect above them) and don’t replace normal special ammo.
---
We did the one this week in like 25 min. If you have a good team and some of the right weapons it's easy. Now when we did it a month ago with terrible builds and low light level it was just over an hour.
---
Yeah we will probably give it a crack. I'll link them to this post, thanks for the write up. I have izanagi with the catalyst so we should be able to follow the guide.
---
No go to the collections page. Bottom right will have badges for each season and dlc. Look at the undying one. It will show you what your missing.
---
Ah ok, clearly I haven't watched it. Just don't like the aesthetic.
---
playing with clanmate will increased the drop chance , i believe this is the only way to increase the drop rate
---
Got it, thanks
---
And this ladies and gentlemen, is why you play the campaign.
---
That's some dedication
---
People from phoenix are called Phoenicians.
---
I use middle tree sunbreaker and it slaps.
---
Sounds like an improvement to me.
---
Most invaders dont super in my experience and just sit back and snipe.
---
The only time I see an invader super are panic supers like Blade Barrage if you surprise them. Good luck killing them in that.
---
True it’s probably a thing they are working on though.
---
Exotics should take universal ornaments tho, so I can be stylish while being efficient. Ever tried to match Orpheus Rig with any armor? Yeah...
---
What about sweaty men that can't play properly with their mum's basem....you know what....nevermind
---
The ‘Final Offensive’ for the Vex Offensive literally just changed the final boss from a Minotaur to a Hydra. Same mechanics, same everything.
---
But the moon stuff was pretty good though.
---
Contraverse Hold is just the first exotic example that came to mind. I use it for PvE and PvP, which have different optimal stats. Different affinities have different reload mods, for one example. Especially given that artifact changes will be coming, we likely won't have the same universal enhanced reload mods we use this season. And Contraverse is one of the poorest examples. You might only want one or two for PvE, but things change when you consider PvP as well. 3 isn't pushing it for those who want different rolls for both PvE situations and PvP situations, especially for other exotics, such as Trans Steps or Ophidian Aspects (any neutral-game exotics), as they fit into so many different desired builds.
---
i know this was a month ago, but i wanted to tell you thank you as well this has been driving me crazy fro SO GODDAMN LONG
---
THANK YOU!!!
---
And final daft question - you don’t have the game still installed on another device? The console won’t instinctively use the version on the SSD if you’ve a copy elsewhere which is linked to the launch option on the front screen.
---
The SSD should make a massive difference. If you see the activity light flashing away on the external enclosure when you launch then it should confirm it being used.
---
I guess I'm out of the loop. What's up with baby Yoda?
---
Do it without Revoker.
---
sword + stronghold is actually good in the crucible if you know what youre doing
---
The book itself said that everything it told you was a lie in one form or another. Bungie told you not to believe what they told you, you believed it anyways. Many things are bungie's fault but this aint it chief.
---
There is just going to be conclusion to all of this Vex invasion on the moon after we kill all of the copies of undying mind. That's most likely it..
---
I gotchu homie
---
Mhm though I seem to only get it from the Hawthorne engram or i apparently just need MORE NIGHT SHADES UPON MY 1000 NIGHTSHADES
---
I'm going for a rapid hit kill clip but oof
---
Half way PRESS
---
yeahh...everyone thought  thaT vex will attack tower or EMZ,or something like that...But bungie really know how to disappoint players,since forsaken  released...
---
Now all we need is a van helsing hat ornament to go with this.
---
Which one is that?
---
As for me d1 is simply more about grinding. And that’s why they made everything feel better so player would stay to grind more. 
---
D2 is made for more casual players and that’s actually not really bad. We still got a bunch of things to grind for, from raids for example. Also destiny is still a game with amazing shooting experience which I love and that’s a reason I like just playing it with no reason
---
You tilt that ship 90° and you get slave-1 :D
---
they just realised that titans were truely the most powerful ones and tried to copy their gloriousness
---
Second after Shaxx
---
Yea man , that was one of the most beautifully structured raids I have ever played thru ...AND IT WAS ON CONSOLE , which I’m not sure if people appreciate that concept enough ...because when you think “raiding” , you think of a computer MMO RPG like WoW where it takes mad mad mad processing power or you’re lagging into oblivion and bungie made this raid happen on a console which is worth a hell of a fucking lot , truly worth it’s weight in glimmer so to say !! 
---
I’m still with the same guild I started D1 with !! Lol we are called the “meme regime supreme” and we all met in college ...and still play D2 “less often than D1 because we’re out of school now” lol but yea , we were all hanging out @ one of our apartments and beat the raid together ...it was truly amazing and I felt beyond accomplished
---
980 nightfall is the only thing that actually took any effort for me.
---
Could it be... You still have the festival of the lost helm still equipped? (it's power is now 0 after the event)
---
Man, that wall is bringing back memories.  I'd like to say they were good ones but what a grind.  Not sure it was worth it.  :)
---
I find it way more annoying than shoulder charge. It's far safer to use without needing to get into shotgun range, where most shoulder chargers get shut down.
---
The double 1K and a Supremacy. Wow.   Hopefully it was a good roll.
---
Nope . Not free . It’s included in the price of the dlc. If it was free you wouldnt have to pay for the next ones . Be real with yourself . If they introduce a fortnite like season pass scam , it’s to get money and nothing else .
---
Nah i play whatever guns i like atm. Rn i'm using The season pass handcannon, that's fun
---
There should be a queue for ppl who play for fun lol
---
Same exact build, i have fps drops too and its annoying, pvp is fine almost no problems tower is terrible and some pve zone i have bad fps like drops to 50 and sometimes 40, the problem is mostly cpu i'm upgrading to a r5 3600 hope it will be better, btw i have noticed more fps drops and stuttering with the last radeon drivers had to rollback.
---
I understand pay to play, i understand people don't find it much effort and reasonable priced dlcs, what i don't understand is having nightfall rotation locked for certain weeks unless u have all dlcs.
---
I really hope they do more capes without hoods. It’s cool to see a full helmet.
---
Most important thing is to have fun out there.
---
What's the roll I should be looking for?
---
You can put the runes in the three slots pf the chalice. By using different runes you can configure what you want to drop from the last chest in Menagerie. The runes are consumed each time you play Menagerie and open the last chest.
---
I usually rock foetracer in the crucible. That helmet looks straight up exo, making me hate choosing my guardian as a human.
---
tried joining on steam, my gamertag is the same as my reddit user. did it get sent?
---
indeed
---
thankful for that dude
---
they do
---
Runes are consumables slotted into the Chalice to farm for weapons and armor. There are specific rune combinations you can use to get a targeted drop (you can look then up pretty easily). Once you've slotted your runes in your Chalice you can open the final chest after the boss in the Menagerie and get loot.
---
You first only get the purple runes, and by buying the upgrades in the 1st category (I forgot its name) you get access to red, green and blue runes in that order.
---
How do you get them? And is there a specific configuration for the catalyst to drop?
---
congrats to him and you
---
ouch sorry man
---
Seems like we were your opponents 😅

The thing is, you have to try for yourself to find the gun that suited for you. I personally use duke mk. 44, the hand cannon that is regarded by many as some of the worst in the current meta because of its long ttk. But for some reason, it works for me. I've tried many other hand cannons with different rpm's but I always came back to the duke.
---
My suggestion is to try at least one hand cannon from each rpm to see what work best for you.
---
I love hearing this voice line not because I got 4 invasion kills but because it just represents my brain on the inside
---
I did see a notification of you joining, but when i went to accept pending invitations, you’re not there. Maybe try again
---
Ummm.......cause Bungie listens?  Sort of?
---
These posts.  I got a bunch of stuff free in this game, why isn't more of it free?  Gettin' old.
---
Do you guys really laugh at the same 3 jokes over and over again?
---
I’ve shutdown and have been shut down with shotguns, the two abilities are equally annoying.
---
So does that guy on C
---
I have no problem with oem post nurf, other than that you can sometimes keep wallhacks when you respawn after trading.
---
It’s because in other games blueberry is a derogatory for unskilled players and noobs. I’m not positive but I think that one derives from Violet Beauregarde from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. They’re spoiled, greedy, and just sit there.
---
Titans: Wait, that's illegal.
---
More than wormhusk. Literally all you have to do is dodge. I'm not saying you have to be a top tier player, but you do have to be at least good enough to kill the other person. So no I'm not joking oem takes more skill than wormhusk.
---
Which language? "Hablar" sounds kinda funny if you don't understand it
---
Next thing you know, new exotic, perk: this weapon is only a trigger that reappears in your hand when thrown.
---
U must have small peepee, verry sad
---
This should be an actual weapon
---
that makes a lot more sense
---
I had some connection issues a couple nights ago, and after I was kicked from a Gambit game and got a warning I switched to PvE to avoid a suspension.
---
Try the usual, hard restart xbox, check for updates, hard restart your router/modem, check your NAT and ensure it's "OPEN"
---
That would be awesome. Just a shotgun shell you throw at your enemies.
---
I understand and was just joking. But i guess im kinda toxic about it. Maybe im just bad.

i wished i had yours. im gonna still to try and complete my rare bounty. if the timers coming to an end, i'll probably stack another set of daily and weekly and hope for a better one to drop

Yea it is, I'll try to get the files. My friend printed it for me.
---
I'm not sure if you're being serious. It's just a visual glitch. I'm actually impressed that they bothered to model the shell inside the gun when you don't even see it.
---
A different end boss, that is from D1 and dies in 1st phase with all blueberries! Yeah, what a let down.

Me too about to reset for 2nd time. I already got the pinnacle weapons so the third grind is going to be long

I don't play Xbox but if you really need help I can jump on and re download it
---
It always feels like I’m Sherpa-ing even when it was their post that said 5+ clears
---
Let this is my main problem with it. Undying mind was a fun fight in D1.
---
All Wormhusk does is heal you, OEM gives you tracking, health, overshield (not anymore soon) and increased damage just by getting shot at, you don't need to press a button to activate it.
---
Yup
---
Haha.  Oh god no, I was not being serious.  Forgot to put a smiley face or something to let you know.  It just seems like something someone would say to complain about Bungie.  :)
---
You don't trow it, you fire it directly from your hand (hold it from the case please). Then you throw away the spent case and take another shell
---
Actually the incentive is three easy kills to finish the undying title.
---
It's hard to tell on here sometimes :)
---
My brother!
---
I don't play Xbox but I have one if your serious about needing help I can re dl it and hop on and help you but my xbox doesn't have shadow keep only my PlayStation does so what we can play will be limited
---
"so wait vex is on the left portal or right portal?"
---
I don’t exactly know all the content you get without shadowkeep but I imagine if you have access to the moon at least you might be able to go there since it is in a public space. I have no idea though.
---
You get it primarily from Asher mir on io
---
The lines do get a bit more blurrier everyday.
---
Doubtful if it was targeted that well, could it have been a timing coincidence?
---
Well, I suppose it's possible China has some slaves in playing who are farming for stuff and uses their state apparatus to go after any opponents... ;)
---
Better start soon.....it’s a grindy title. I’m on the final part of the strike quest, 10 more nightfalls with randoms......fun
---
The weapons drop from the boss. So the people you share with miss out too.
---
By blockers you mean the corrupts stopping you from adding cores to the bank? I have the game in a different language, so sometimes I feel lost with names.
---
Thanks!
---
I would, except I refuse to wear that thing because it's ridiculous looking.
---
With how rare exotic engram drops are, they really should make them like the fated ones and never duplicate
---
Shut up and take my glimmer. And all my exotics. Possibly even my soul.
---
[removed]
---
Hey, also good write up!
---
Your start also sounds really solid and well planned.
---
To the platinum rewards we weren't sure about this one but its good to know that you can skip this.

Thanks for your input!

Yea and im just over here like ._.

On a side note if anyone needs help with anything at all I'm always willing to help with an activity or two I'm on PlayStation just PM me your psn  and I'll help you when I wake up
---
These are drops? I haven't seen one for so long... Kinda pisses me off you can play for 70 hours and not see one. Despite playing some of the hardest bloody content...
---
If it is anything like the box of raisins in Destiny 1 it won’t have a use
---
Jez would certainly be proud. Well done.
---
Ah the good ol VoG carry role,  I remember those days.
---
This it actually the file we modified for our current one.
---
Hmm interesting, i guess ill try it
---
Yeah seems I'm going mainly hunter from what I gathered from the others. The main problem that I had which lead to the thread is that it's a hassle to change between characters because of the loading screens compared to simply switching subclasses. 
---
Thank you tho I learned that most items are not class specific and those that aren't can't be farmed so I don't have to fuss about that then.
---
From my experience (last night I even went to each vendor leveling up to try for mods) it was rarely anything over 50. But if you are looking for mods they drop pretty frequently from any of them.
---
Just farm a new Trust in Gambit. EZ.
---
Revoker possibly
---
Revoker
---
*Laughs in 4x Honed Edge*
---
File time
---
Beloved
---
*in Shaxx’s voice*: guardian! We need those files!
---
the should have all bushed at once  they must be heroic rank trust me legend rank no one does this
---
Top golden gun is a more pvp focused super but it still does good damage against majors and adds, it's just not the same boss melt as bottom gg.
---
Revoker and beloved are the two that are most often seen used in pvp. There are a handful of others that get used, but none of them nearly as often as those two.
---
Commenting for files
---
A good bite of the fox, and tranquility
---
Do you have any examples? I played a lot of D1, got the full first year moment of triumph etc.
---
Just never knew it was a thing.
---
Easily one of the best looking guns in the game. It's a shame my energy slot is so saturated with HCs though. I always find myself struggling to find a legendary kinetic HC I like.
---
Revoker, Beloved or The Long Walk if you got that from Trials way back
---
If you decide to get back into playing often, forsaken is on sale digitally for $15.
---
its a glitch u got lucky
---

Charlie..... :(
---
Literally just got this gun with swash and outlaw.
---
Thanks!!!
---
How does timed payload work?  Does it split damage like explosive rounds, or is it extra delayed damage. I used a Ten Paces with it in Nightfall last night but could not tell exactly what it was doing with all of the team shooting.
---
The gunsmith drops Halfdan-D and Erentil FR4, both really good guns with the right rolls
---
It's a trap!
---
Garden drops mods that are only for Garden. Relay, Tether, Motes, etc. I’ve never gotten regular mods in there.
---
Look up Destiny 2 PC LFG Discord. Super easy to find sherpas in their LFS channels
---
That’s because whoever is on the team that’s supposed to be opening the door must just be slow.
---
Having quality teammates makes a difference. The clan I’m in, the lot of us are Shadows and Rivensbane so we spend a decent amount of time playing.
---
What I’ve noticed is my team is actually able to open the door a lot of the time before the 3rd overflow even gets dropped, saving time. So we can clear the first encounter in about 5-7 mins. My loadout for the first encounter is Austringer, Recluse with Overlord and Sleeper. Recluse and Sleeper can literally take care of everything with ease. Cyclops, Minos, nothing stands a chance. 
---
Then the jumping puzzle I do solo. We actually timed it last night I cleared the puzzle start to finish in 39s. Then the second encounter I just pull everyone and we hit the ground running. Clear that in about 6-7m.
---
But the 3rd encounter is just cancer on a flawless run and have yet to clear it flawless. Trying again tonight.
---
niceeee
---
Rad! As a former metal sculptor it never ceased to amaze me how much a cast could look like a piece of crap right out of the mold, and how great it would look once you finish chasing it. I taught kids for 3 years and they'd always be so heartbroken at first haha.
---
Don't forget to post the final result!
---
I used my Ender 3 printer
---
Why fighting lion tho
---
The one on earth should still work. Got it from there but i can't quite remember how, believe you needed a spider bounty.

I had an Xbox one at one point but had the red ring of death. Never got another one. It's been on the "To do list"

*earrape Mariah Carey's All I Want For Christmas*
---
Titan main but not an oem titan, heres the thing i believe that oem isnt even really all that good sure its powerful but it doesnt require any real skill to take advantage of its perks and therefore the more skilled titan mains dont use it just because it doesnt give us the game play we want for instance i use armamentarium i have a very grenade based loadout i get alot of kills with grenades because thats fun i would never use oem because as i said there is no skill involved id just play like normal and i hope the perks activated i find no fun in that. 
---
Tldr: oem isnt fun to play with for a skilled titan main
---
I’m a warlock and personally I abuse the handheld super nova but your sacrificing a good super for the good grenade because personally I don’t really care for nova warp. But the grenade is awesome. But titans using that stupid mask with shoulder charge one punch or shotguns Is just nuts and on top of that they actually get an enjoyable super
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
You’re the hero we need kind sir.
---
Loud Lullaby is pretty nice too. Very reliable.
---
Yeah, Bungie screwed us on that one. At least could've been some purpose for the portal, why even build it at all?
---
Don’t mind me just saving a comment
---
Scatterhorn and Reverie Dawn and Prodigal and Tangled Web all look 10x better than "If my PS2 had the IQ of a pork chop sandwich and a handful of extra chromosomes" Thorium Holt armor.
---
Oof.
---
Nice
---
All the hype for recycled content that’s just lazy
---
Heads up guardian
---
Which strike do you think he got 100k on?
---
80% chance Bungie just wipes off rasputin with an eraser in 2 seconds of an opening cutscene, just to show how bad the situation is.
---
Don’t you think spawning with heavy ammo is shitty? I do.
---
This is the model we modified
---
No
---
The most underappreciated comments I've seen on this subreddit
---
Ugh you people are so shallow minded
---
Except it's not heavy, there are other special made launchers that can actually one shot, and it takes an exotic slot
---
Miss out on the shader 'cos that all they ever drop for me .... except once when Uriels Gift dropped &gt;.&lt;
---
War Machine using Cap’s shield :P
---
Why wouldn't you read it in his voice?
---
Well then let’s get rid of all the grenade launchers that aren’t power weapons
---
I actually had a great moment yersterday when it was 3-3 and 1v1, the last enemy guardian was in arc strider super and I managed to dodge him for a good 10 seconds until it ended and then i just shot him.   I kinda felt bad for him though.
---
If you are talking about power level then no , you will only progress slower because the option for getting pinnacle gear is reduce . And you will also miss some exotic and activity , that's about it.  (Which is no big deal )
---
Since my hunter was Arach Jalaal's bitch I rarely took off my Dead Orbit exo cloak, but it was nice putting on these once in a while. Took me forever to get all 3 lol
---
GIVF
---
Why, just cuz they killed you a couple times doesn't mean they are op, they are more balanced than most other weapon types
---
The portal is in the vex offensive it’s the one we summon the new boss out of
---
Files pls
---
Not penny’s boat?
---
I've got one that has outlaw, rampage, and high caliber rounds then put the unstoppable hand cannon mod on. Stagger much?
---
Love this! Here for the files
---
I thought they already had that when they press F (Which makes everyone else press F to pay respects.)
---
I want dose files too, please.
---
Woosh
---
Killer party popper
---
So for the hunter you need to dodge near a enemy but the warlock doesn’t have that they have a well of healing or empowerment
---
Except when you play crucible apparently.
---
So the triumph box will become unchecked next season? I hear so many mixed answers to this (even in this thread)
---
*cackles in Karnstein+Monte Carlo+ Thunder Coil+ Stormcaller mid*
---
Bungie already has one of the most effective anti cheat systems. Nobody actually cheats but tryhard mode is rampant. Be prepared to see a lot of arc titans, OEMs, Recluses and Last Words.
---
Heh the final assault is doodoo
---
You are not a clown, you are the entire circus
---
"no"
---
Cayde is smiling down at you from server heaven
---
I mean monte carlo and sunbracers pretty much keeps my solar melee at 100% non stop, but then I also get 5 grenades I can chuck after I melee kill something.
---
You can't buy it
---
I sweet business mained for a long time in crucible and some pve activities and it was incredibly fun. I suggest actium war rig if you can find it as well - going for ten minutes without reloading feels incredible. Especially when it's the entire crucible match.
---
I won’t have a ton of time to play this season unfortunately.. And I’ve read so many different answers all over the internet so hoping to get an answer here once and for all :)
---
God I hope so. Glory was so easy for me. I might've got lucky but I won like 8-10 straight and was done.
---
_**Laughs in Devour Grenades and Melee**_
---
there is literally more than 10 active cheats in destiny, and believe me when I say I can tell the diference between sweatys and cheaters.
---
Honestly if anything the nurf was too harsh, maybe just reducing the timer on wall hacks would have been more than enough to make it level with other exotics.
---
Uh huh, you clearly don't know the raid bosses if you think you can melee them all to death
---
And oh so you admit hunters are useless on their own and require to be carried by other players to have any kind of relevance in endgame. That's progress at least!
---
Thats mean. I'm telling Zavala
---
Yes, you have to hit fabled in the same season that you complete the other objectives
---
Rapid fires are pretty meh, I’d say use a Aggressive frame. Farm for a Mindbenders with QuickDraw and you’re set. If you don’t like Aggressives, then Retold Tale is pretty good. If you’re set on using a rapid fire, go for a Badlanders (you can farm it in the menagerie), get one with slideshot, accurized rounds or full choke, snapshot even. That’s the best rapid fire shoty unless you get the Scourge of the past shotgun with QuickDraw. 
---
As for your second question, I have no clue. D3 doesn’t have much revealed about it, and honestly I would doubt that D3 isn’t happening, and the destiny we have now is the one we’ll have for the next couple years. But if it’s like D1, then yeah you’ll lose everything in D2. But they knew that everyone hated that so I’ll be surprised if they do that again.
---
Mida mini tool is so good that’s the new recluse
---
Quikly grabe all the engrams and eververse items you can
---
It's impossible.
---
It requires 20 exotic engrams and you can't hold any in your inventory anymore.
---
Even when you could, 10 was the max.
---
Hmm it really sucks they don’t tell you though. But thanks!
---
Winter festival will be the next time we use it . Then you get the quest sorry can’t tell the quest yet
---
...and my bow!
---
There are cheaters. However they aren't running rampant thankfully. I believe the anti cheat gets them after a few games for the most part. I've seen some videos on here, and a friend finally encountered one last night. I haven't personally seen any myself either.
---
There are also a lot of players that are better than you. Sometimes you just need to accept that too.
---
More of these please
---
That's implying that I ever gave the notion that I'd stop punching every chance I get
---
👀
---
If you’re playing on Pc, we have a 21 or older clan looking for new members old or new lights. We run plenty of raids and there is always people on to help with quest, Pvp, or just the daily grind. Pm me if you this sounds like a place for you! See you soon guardian.
---
Well, you've had plenty of time and still have. When i, an average pvp'er can get this done in 3 days, then you should easily be able to do this in the ~3 weeks that remain.
---
Yea
---
Are you sure or are you just saying this because I asked? :)
---
There’s tons of cheaters so I feel you. Bungie really hasn’t said much about it, I think they’re taking a Ubisoft route and secretly patching it out, I can’t be positive though. If you want to play the game then honestly I’d say move to console, I main PC but I switched over to console because of the cheaters. If you want M&amp;K, just use an adapter on console to play M&amp;K. Console is also the least toxic in my opinion, but it’s not so terrible that there’s nonstop Blueberries.
---
Why is it when I open my postmaster its allways you three?
---
You just punch the back of the shell
---
Yes i agree but allthough i do believe there is way too much ugly gear i think that atleast there should be more variaty towards different factions ... like a leveling of how the gear looks ... you start with a plain looking armor for EDZ for example and once you get to certain rank you start getting the same armor but with some extra details and on and on and on , to the point that you look “GOOD” ... but i feel like every armor but the eververse one looks completely ugly and plain... the warlocks look like they are searing bathrobes , the titans look like optimus prime and the hunters dont have ONE cape that its made out of fabric that goes beyond the butt or is torn ... there should be better looking gear even if it emplies getting old gear from D1 like the osiris gear and the crap we got for mercury...  they even took away the factions for no reason ... i honestly dont know what they are doing 🤷‍♂️
---
I should try this combo
---
Mostly after a point they are useless, but on console it is bad because it can take around 3-4 minutes to load the tower so we end up never going to the tower because it takes soo long.  Even when we should like when I was 920 and primes did something, I got around 4 before I went because i did not want the load time when I could do something
---
I was going to say the same and hate to sound like Captain Hindsight but Momentum Control was the best enviroment to be able to knock out kills needed for Randy's, Mountaintop and Revoker.  I was able to get all 3 of those this season thank to Momentum Control.  I would hate to now have to do any of those steps in regular crucible.  But Mountaintop would seem like the one to go for because of the Fabled requirement.  Randy's requires glory also but you're progress for the wins will never be lost even after the season is over as compared to Mountaintop and having to hit Fabled.
---
Hi All!
---
I’m a retiring player who played religiously year 1, but moved and haven’t been all to active after Forsaken dropped, like I finished the campaign but never did the last wish raid. 
---
I’m just booted up my game and it’s all changed a lot. Where should I start to get some good guns/armor/anything really? It doesn’t appear to be the same with prime engrams from all the activities like it was. 
---
Thanks for your help!
---
You deserve gold, my friend
---
what's that scout rifle?
---
No problem, I would highly recommend finishing it this season tho, it's not that many wins
---
Are you even listening or are the cryons to deep in you ass?
---
You and your class are useless and not needed for any activity.
---
6hunter can 1 phase every raid boss while 6 titans cant even start a dmg phase
---
For your safety, please put an orange tip on that. The last thing you want is anyone thinking you have a real gun
---
The fastest you could possibly go with 5 newbies would probably be about an hour, provided that you’ve got good weapons and have more than 2 braincells.
---
I’d say a more reasonable timeframe would be 1 and a half to 2 hours.
---
Keep up the good work!!👏👏👏
---
Zavala has them in his inventory as quest items such as Oxogyn sr3 or windego (sorry DONT know how to spell that) they are blue tickets
---
If you play water polo this meme is useless. That water feels so damn good
---
How tf...
---
Xenophage not doing damage as intended, inzanagi quest and it's first bug that generated a second one after patching it... 
---
Yes it was "quickly" patched and yes it wasn't that long but i find it not admissible from bungie furthermore for stuff that used to work before. I know it's hard with such a big game to prevent a change from breaking something else but that's far too common with destiny 2 and far more than other game IMO. ( i'm just speaking about update and dlc breaking the game not the state of the game at launch... that's another debate)
---
I use helm of saint 14 was my helm all through d1 so continued the legacy
---
Zavala gives quests that require you to do x amount of kills with a certain weapon and a few more requirements to that. The only one really worth going for is wendigo grenade launcher.
---
That i have mire exp/flawless/day one than a uselees ape like you?
---
What’s your role?
---
Hammer forged, high cal rounds, genesis, rampage :/
---
USE THE FIRETEAM FINDER.  There are so many players on it who are in a similar situation and you are very likely to find some helpful people who are also fun to team up with.
---
Use pulse rifles. It took me 3 hours to get 2100, then 10 more to get required win count.
---
Fine by me. I feel good every time someone wastes a super on me
---
You can’t reset glory
---
Are you queing into the solo playlist or the 3v3?
---
Except you don't. The numbers don't lie and, again, you're free to look me up to compare

Playing more, finding a suitable loadout, finding a clan to help you out, making friends who may help you.
---
This isn't ment to be a solo game, and In some activities you may need friends if you cant do it yourself. If you choose to stay alone, or you have to, then all you can do is play more and get better at the game. It wont happen in a day, but hard work will pay off.
---
There was an unspoken rule of thumb over the past seasons about comp: if you lose two in a row, stop. Take a break, play pve or even something else for awhile. Also I hope you are in the solo “freelance” playlist.
---
Which one is supposed to be the shit tho
---
Rapid Fire Frame pulse rifles worked pretty well for me.
---
I can’t even cheese it since I don’t know anyone that’s down to do it
---
Oh man. I honestly can't believe I didn't see the resemblence until now! 😂😂
---
Moving target also gives a hidden mobility perk.
---
Dude. Noone cares about stuff you made up with an account/usename you found to pretend is yours.
---
Go eat crayons and stop lieing you flithy titan
---
I got my wins via Iron Banner which count towards that. Then I just had to get the rank which wasn't that bad assuming you occasionally get some pretty good teammates and are somewhat competent at pvp.
---
You want to know my new least favorite grind? Having to do a rare black armory bounty for Izanagi Burden that requires 25 forge completions. I now hate black armory.
---
1-2 hours is far from average with 5 newbies.
---
Most groups i saw so far took 4-6 hours, including divinity.
---
CLEAN SHOTS. What's the roll on it? I got a snapshot/moving target that I've decided to use for the Revoker grind and it's nicccccce.
---
Oh, but those are garbage. Ah well

There are 2 in destiny 2

And the mini tool while already ar 10 mobility AND turning your hud off

Fair enough.

I kinda thought it would be easier now that basically everybody's at 950.

Great to see people willing to help. I start the D2 3weeks ago still learning the tricks, looking to a loot o youtube vid's inching to hunt for a leviathan but didn't had the time to lookup for a group.
---
wow
---
Yep it’s the tier 3 reckoning collector cloak :) we were doing gambit prime earlier so I had my full set on. If I had the last piece like I usually do, the snakes glow even brighter on the cloak which is super cool
---
This is how it was before shadowkeep. Now that new light has been released, the exotics were removed from them.
---
This reddit account is like a year and a half old and my destiny account has been with bungie since the destiny 1 beta

Hate to do you in like this but you did kind of brought it upon yourself

My recluse alternative has been calus mini tool with threat detector surrounded and surrounded spec MW  for range, nearly 7000 kills with it!
---
Should take it to school to show all ur friends
---
No.
---
They should make some gloves that have like a 10 min cd Joten charge lol
---
It feels like the weight of a thousand Gjallarhorns has been lifted from my shoulders after I got Exit Strategy... finally, no more gambit 😌
---
This video made me happy
---
I tried for like 3 and a half hours yesterday.  It dropped 5 times total for the others with me, but not once for me @_@
---
Shining Sphere, it's from Iron Banner.
---
Hes right :)
---
Fair enough! Yeah, I also had to put 4 slots towards discipline mods to get up to 100, so I wasn’t able to use paragon mods. Bottom tree arcstrider + arc battery was giving me my dodge back pretty fast but yeah, being able to slap a bunch of paragon mods on while maintaining 100 disc would be crazy.
---
I support this as a true Titan main, I applaud you good fellow.
---
 \&gt;Titan one 
---
Crown-splitter. Heavy slam is best, change my mind.
---
Depends on person, but the universal rules are "don't be toxic", look up how to trigger heroic public events if you are doing them since most players wanna do them but new light players usually just melt the boss, usually missing the heroic part and pls enjoy game.
---
329h according to wasted on destiny
---
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
---
Good to know people are finding new ways of bitching about oem, good on you
---
No unfortunately. I reeeaalllyy don't want to deal with the load times of consoles when I just want to kick back and play.
---
Let me be funny and unfactual
---
But for real, I was going based off of my total play time according to Xbox. Last I checked it was around 60ish days
---
It doesn't prevent you from going down, you still lose points. I don't think you still lose ranks though. But the better you play, the less points you lose when you lose and the more points you gain when you win. I played as well as i could since i'm average and got this within 16 matches. People that think this is hard, should attempt mountaintop and luna/nf.
---
Wow.. Didn't know that those things were there in those doorways... Looks painful!
---
Cayde-6 Vengeance Squad
---
Just sayin' it's always been darn good
---
Can also do this with one celestial, one izanagis burden shot and a void/tether
---
Every titan this season trying to grind that Vanguard Quest.
---
BRUH THATS THE EXACT SAME GAMING MOUSE I HAVE, BUT DONT USE
---
You from denmark?
---
I’ve ran into this guy multiple times and he’s pretty bad so seeing this just cements my opinion.
---
Sure bud.
---
Hey, I'm not that experienced, only 210 hours in, but I'd say that you should work on pinnacles and quest exotics like Izanagi's Burden (Black Armory exotic), Recluse (crucible pinnacle), Wendigo (strike pinnacle). For armor - it's all RNG, really, though don't expect high stat armor from prime engrams - I usually get 48-52 base stat legendaries from it. Oh, and be sure to do your free levels of the season pass if you haven't gotten the season pass, though I wouldn't recommend getting it right now.
---
uhhhh wasn't Pit of Heresy released around 4 weeks after Shadowkeep?
---
I appreciate that name
---
I am seeing a few more people playing with Malfeasance nowadays.. Did they buff it or something?
---
Correct, Pit of Heresy had a delayed release date but it is not part of Season of Undying, it is part of Shadowkeep.
---
This. First tests (200Mbit connection via Google) shows on average 35-45ms more input lag. If you play with a controller already, that should still be "okay-ish". Definitely going to hurt a bit with M/K, but nothing lag compensation can't fix.
---
It shouldn't feel "slower" tho, unless you usually play with M/K and now play with a controller, which could impact things like turn speed and such.
---
When I say “made” I mean edit in photoshop to add text
---
This makes sense. The seasonal activities will never be on the scale of expansional activities. On a side note, I have thoroughly enjoyed the Garden of Salvation.
---
Meh, I mean, shit isn’t exactly a cake walk, but it’s not super hard either. Make sure you’re working on upgrading your chalice too. I got back into it at shadowkeep and grounded that fucking quest out, only wish I had done chalice bullshit too.
---
I can hear this picture
---
Don't mind me, I'm just picking some flowers while safe in my skullfort.
---
i mistyped that, i meant nightfall.  i finally got it after like 7 hours and 50 runs tho
---
Agreed.
---
That boss also has less health I think
---
Maybe you should post it to bungies Twitter then it would help your cause because your just pissing in the wind here.
---
Has to be a headshot though lmao
---
Also, my brother upgraded his GPU but not his power supply and it would run fine on most games but more graphic intense games would shut his PC down. He got a higher psu and no issues now.
---
Noble gunslingers rise, this is our time to shine
---
Not to be that guy, but water sports make you sweaty and hot. Even in the water. An ice cold water bottle dumping over you feels so good. It's almost an unbeatable feeling.
---
F
---
sounds like a titan complaining about a “broken, one shot” mechanic LUL
---
This is one of those lore tabs they retcon later.
---
It's part of the fun, can't have it be braindead like Titan shoulder charge lol
---
Yo imagine failing reading comprehension, I’m not complaining I’m happy, because that means every hunter will now, well if they’re not disingenuous pathological liars, can’t cry about the titan one shot melee when there’s is better in every way
---
The gun is restored to its glory. I'm sure he would be proud, Guardian!
---
Could... Yes
---
Would...
---
 Best part [1:19](https://youtu.be/Y2hBIbffv48)
---
titan one shot melee is not a projectile, it’s a melee to begin with, on top of one of the most powerful supers in the game. PVP wise hunters are the weakest.
---
Crimson with Karnstein is one of my favorite builds for most things. Really rewards playing aggressive.
---
But them explosions from Sunshot probably make it my favorite HC now that they buffed it's mag size.
---
Pinnacle armor would be awesome!
---
You don’t play the game then, Mr Strawman
---
Unless it’s a night stalker, shadow shot is like the anti fun super of crucible, it’s the super you use when the only thing you care about is ruining other people day
---
The nova bombs then explode, sending Gallahorn missiles in every direction, but instead of there being tracking cluster bombs on detonation, it explodes into MORE Gally missiles, which then explode into the tracking cluster bombs.
---
God dammit I crossposted this yesterday but it got taken down because it wasn’t destiny related :((
---
Above
---
This is a beautiful build! im gonna steal it.
---
Where is this info from please?
---
For sure Not, you are a kid who is producing a shit Playmobile. You are my Hero.
---
Looks like team rocket is blasting off again
---
Luckily, I have a Gallahorn.
---
It took me 10 years but i was finally able to find the comments that weren't asking for files.
---
fucking finally, some good changes
---
This week at bungie. Looks like all the solar classes are getting reworks.
---
Yea lol
---
Practice, apostate
---
The Dan was the only was I got recluse, outlaw/kc with max range

Miscolored
---
Bruh, I feel you. I've been waiting for this change since destiny 2 came out.
---
GOS gets really stale as well, and the Dungeon imo looks no where near as cool as Shattered Throne did.
---
The name is literally in the sub title...
---
That is correct but she hasn’t been present for the past several months. This is actually an old screenshot I had from last years festival but it was removed from the main sub because they don’t like memes over there
