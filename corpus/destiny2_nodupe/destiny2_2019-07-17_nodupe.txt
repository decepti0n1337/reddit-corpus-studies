Middle tree is fun, but it's not "good".
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Thundercrash is laughably bad. A peregrine greaves shoulder charge does more damage than the thundercrash super.
---
Thundercrash should be doing celestial nighthawk damage considering the danger it puts you in, the fact that you're in the middle of whatever survived after your super is done, you're far away from your team and away from a possible revive if you die, and you can't contribute to extra DPS until you get back.
---
Skullfort to give back the ground pound is nice...until someone shoots the guy you're ground pounding and you lose it. So you just sit there useless until it comes back.
---
I say this as a 100% pure blooded titan main. I love titans to death, the playstyle is so fun and I could never imagine maining anything else. But fucking hell I could write an essay about how underpowered titans are
---
---
---
This isn't an LFG sub.
---
Rule 14.
---
/r/Fireteams
---
They look way too dark. The light doesn¬¥t even light up the one in the left. I would say that in this new race, those would stand around the power of a hive knight or a fallen captain. They look like wizards too.
---
LOL. Yeah dude, melting point is outdone by an empowering rift at this point.
---
He can‚Äôt even get up from his chair, his overwhelming THICC weighs him down
---
That‚Äôs how you‚Äôre choosing to rationalize an unhealthy behavior. This thread is proof that in the back of your mind you know it isn‚Äôt right. You‚Äôre seeking validation and approval for the situation.  It‚Äôs only a matter of time before she‚Äôs questioning who you work with, why are you late, who are you going out with, who do you go to lunch with etc. In your mind you think Destiny is the problem and quitting is the solution. But the real problem  that you fail to see is she‚Äôs jealous of you speaking to other people and even worries that you‚Äôre speaking to other women. This will permeate into other areas. Soon you‚Äôll find her questioning other aspects of your life, especially the fact that you mentioned you work long hours. 
---
This isn‚Äôt meant to be rude. I‚Äôm just old enough to have seen and experienced this same behavior. It may start small but next thing you know you‚Äôre not allowed to go out and speak with your friends anymore. Go read up on healthy and unhealthy jealousy and see if it rings a bell.
---
Good luck
---
Banner shields for Heroic Flawless last week tho
---
I haven‚Äôt realized it either but I always run music soo
---
It's also super inconsistent. I've had it throw me off in the complete opposite direction of people. So it's definitely not a reliable one hit kill
---
Is the cheese patched for it? I know you can requeue until you get the dreaming city strike and then go to the blind well. Although it would still take hours, its better than the latter
---
I'm commenting because o.p is wanting people to snitch on so called cheaters. I never see the need to run and tell on someone.  Sorry if that upsets you dude
---
Moments of triumph is staying till shadow keep so you have a good while
---
How reckoning works is you are guaranteed an armor piece based on the mote you offer at the start. There are 3 tiers of mote, one for each tier of armor. There are four types of motes, one for each of the four armor sets. This means you can control what tier and what set an armor piece is from. However, besides the helmet bounties that give the lowest tier helmet you haven't gotten yet, what armor piece you get is random.
---
diNg diNg dinG dinG DING
---
"Worth" is subjective. It really depends what you care about as a player. The year 1 raids won't give powerful gear, but they do give items that are still useful.
---
I remember when they 1 shot in destiny 1. That shit was so much fun. No idea why they nerfed it I dont recall any complaints.
---
There‚Äôs an end date in August to complete the seal, so I understand though??
---
It leaves 3 weeks before shadowkeep I think üò©
---
My best one? Blade Barrage the entire team and then picking up 2 more kills before getting pulled 
---
My Hunter isn't even my main
---
Even so that‚Äôs still a month and a half
---
All forges
---
I‚Äôm already going through the first half of your post. We argued til 12am the other night because I‚Äôm out of town on work and I went to a bar and grille with a male coworker. She heard bar and flipped. She assumes I‚Äôm drinking and conversing with women if it‚Äôs a bar.
---
This is very helpful, thanks so much
---
I'm gonna go stand near it knowing I sure as hell forgot to grab more and hope someone else has one.
---
Raids are great if you like team play with comms on discord, otherwise no
---
You‚Äôll love it!
---
I haven‚Äôt had the year 1 gear so I wouldn‚Äôt mind getting it. I want to get the bad juju and need some Claus armour so need to the raids so will have to do it - how long does the leviathan raid take roughly ?
---
SotP is a brilliant raid regardless of the weapons though
---
That..doesn't seem like a healthy relationship.
---
Ehh it's more Titans and Warlocks complaining about Hunters but nothing gets done but when either class get something actually decent (NOVA WARP) Hunter lose their shit and spam Bungie until it gets nerfed to the point it might as well be the pistol from when you first start
---
I have spent a solid 6-10 hours there
---
That's why I turned off messaging lol
---
Hey! Welcome to the community! If you need a clan just find us at "The Ace's Folly." I, as well as u/Chr0n041ph4 are the founders. We'd be happy to help you progress and get familiar with the game!
---
Yeah thats most likely tbh but like unsaid i think that it would be like super meh to introduce them on a hive dlc instead than on their on dlc i think
---
Dear /u/IV_NUKE,
---
Don't solo-queue Comp.
---
Problem solved.
---
Man Revoker is straight up just alright, but the bullet refund makes me take so many more dumb shots and the payoff is landing one and going, "Oh shit!" Gun is hella fun.
---
BO and BO2 were a lifestyle. I miss popping smoke in nuketown
---
Well let‚Äôs see what titans all have...
---
Melting point-extremely useful. 
---
Hammers-high damage and ad clear.
---
Fists of havoc and thunder crash- high damage and ad clear.
---
Shoulder charge + skullfort-infinite shoulder charge with high ad clear.
---
Sentinel- high ad clear.
---
Banner shield- big buff and help to teammates.
---
Bubble-helps in a few situations where survivability is tough eg. Punching deception in CoS.
---
I love my Titan in PvE idk why people are saying their not good lol
---
Sometimes holding onto a super in countdown or survival isn‚Äôt a bad idea
---
Good luck. My wife sees pvp and says "F that quest, F that quest." The recluse is such a great gun to not have. As far as my mountaintop grind, mayhem was a godsend last week for those multikills running teather. I started the week at 42%. I'm just happy a GL is not required in the rank grind.
---
The gambit one is an utter nightmare. I wont mind the cruc one cause well i like crucible.
---
Well you see maybe some of us dont have friends that like to play pve. And its pretty easy to use 2 braincells
---
Happy cake day
---
Yes bur when its final round and you dont even use it then its a problem
---
Lfg
---
Its especially worse when you just completly wadte tether by shooting it towards nobody
---
I‚Äôve gone up and down to 700 glory to 0 about 6 times now. I‚Äôm on the last bit for Luna‚Äôs howl where I need to get to fabled and I plum don‚Äôt think I can do it solo anymore. It‚Äôs really a shame. I‚Äôve done all the parts on my own I hate having to rely on other people to carry me across the finish line
---
I dont wanna take a long ass time find a group and see that they are hot garbage and try to find another
---
It's piss easy to solo to fabled. I solo to 3k every season then play with my friends for up to legend
---
Most of them are thumbnails but I look up the image using Google Images
---
God damn digital ops
---
How does one do these
---
Stompees make them literally untrackable on console, there isn't a high enough sensitivity setting for me to track a stompees hunter jumping because they go so fast and high, at which point you get shotgunned by dust rock blues.
---
Yo I don't want to put my dick where it doesn't belong but that sounds dodgy as fuck.
---
This aint no /r/relationships but SO shouldn't be that controlling with what other people do in their spare time, provided you are only playing 1-3 hours a night.
---
Anyway, good luck man. Have a good one. Come back soon!
---
looks like warlock is the consensus.  i'll start one tomorrow.  thanks alot everyone
---
Mmm...bath water...and Ada-1 is my #1!
---
YeH so does mine. We cheeseed for the mountaintop kills and she gpt all her sniper kills for the revoker. So she is half way through that glory but she cant string together wins so hopefully i can help get her there
---
Me using a bot to grind glory for reckoner
---
# The Machinist
---
Pretty sure they did that on purpose
---
Hey man i think you post would be great over on r/destinylore
---
Literal best use of the meme
---
Thx bro.
---
The description should‚Äôve been ‚ÄúBeneath The Lake, Darkness awaits‚Äù
---
We would love to post there, but they don't allow image posts.
---
Neither of those waifus are Ana Bray so....
---
Yeah, I worry for this dude. I've seen it happen. Never gets addressed in the relationship, blows up later when she decides he can't have any female friends.
---
Oh well, it's his life.
---
Congrats dude. I've been at heroic 3 for weeks now so I'm pretty bummed out at this point. Only been getting 4 stacks every time I'm within 1 game.
---
Maybe give banner shield the ability to slam it into the ground? But then its kinda like the bubble. Ah idk
---
I‚Äôve never had a problem with stomper hunters. Maybe that‚Äôs something in your end, I don‚Äôt know. I run 8 sensitivity + traction on PS4 and I‚Äôm fine. But thanks for your feedback, maybe that‚Äôs an issue lots of other people are having, I just can‚Äôt relate.
---
You carry in rumble??
---
I think the way to go would be rat king, a scout rifle (preferably void), and a legendary sword. The sword could be for add clear and to give you a chance to pick up more rat king ammo.
---
I just started a clan and looking to get it to grow so if you are interested I am active, and you can send me a message at Mountainman8692
---
i forgot rat king was a primary apologies i had surgery today ü•¥ but thanks for the tip i may try it this weekend
---
[deleted]
---
When I watched the livestream, I understood that weapons that you could only get if you had the DLC could now be obtained by anyone, but now I'm kinda disappointed it isn't this way. Still a massive upgrade on every way, tho.
---
Mountainman8692 is also my Xbox gamertag
---
No need to apologise! I hope the surgery went well.
---
Claim a bounty and it will let you play
---
We have to catch them by surprise
---
Hey I'm down if all you are.
---
Not worth it
---
AoS, oem, spectral, bottom tree striker, novawarp and contraverse hold, dawnblade, drb, wardcliff, blast furnace and the list goes on. Just find something that works for you and roll with it. And dont forget to 4 stack
---
my preference is better

To this day, one of the only LFG raid groups that I have left before completing the raid was a group of friends who were too busy insulting each other to actually do the raid. After a few wipes on Kalli, we finally completed that one encounter and then I ditched them for a different group.
---
Me trying to do scourge last night but we get stuck on the last phase cause no one knows how to look in the bottom left corner to see what buff they have.
---
Question if I do buy it will I be able to play all 3 seasons or just the one we are in?
---
I want to make a subby that says my friend spider instead of my friend Pedro
---
I got there with a dust rock inaugural address and a tractor cannon middle hunter tree with vest .
---
Let us say the loremaster‚Äôs prayer.
---
I meant fist of havoc, not thunder crash. Didn‚Äôt they also change it so the explosion kills you, not the blades itself.? That‚Äôs way more reaction time than a charging gliding Titan using fist of havoc
---
All 3, new content doesnt go away except for event stuff
---
myelin doesn't put on a fake accent
---
Yeah EST. I'm on nights + weekends generally.
---
Oh, those aren't quests.  Every weekly reset resets your raid progress - so you just have to do the raids again.
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox I‚Äôll help you out sometime I love helping people in destiny
---
Sorry dude, responding to two thread at once, went to the wrong one.  THanks for the info.
---
The whole triumph is about killing another super with your super
---
Thicc
---
I think your questioning u/CowboysWinItAll is hilarious considering you just said, "when I *mained* titan." That says it all. If you used to, meaning you don't anymore, I wonder if it could possibly be because the PvE contribution from Titans is, as OP so eloquently put it, "straight ass"?
---
The whole point he was making was in regards to PvE. There are no viable supers for boss encounters in PvE that don't strictly rely on ad-clearing while Warlocks and Hunters take care of the big guy.
---
OwO guardiwan wat are wu dwoing with your fwingewrs? ono downt pwull my twigga uwaaaah nyah ~ &lt;3!
---
Could i get a confirmation on how many ppl waited the weekly bonus reset to get recluse/mountaintop/luna etc?
---
Do you have multiple characters?
---
In the top right and bottom right there are filters. Make sure you filter for all or cycle through. You haven‚Äôt looked hard enough
---
I cycled through all the filters and looked for 10 minutes
---
I do, but they were all on my warlock, he‚Äôs the only one I‚Äôve played in months
---
sees both waifus  
---
me: ughhhh *ziiiippp*
---
Ahh, that classic word doc stream
---
Lunastra? You playing MHW? Lol.  What step were you on for malfeasance?
---
He sits on a lazy boy toilet like in Idiocracy.
---
Underrated comment. Give this man an award
---
I‚Äôm a HEAVY hand canon user and I only use blast furnace as a pulse, but I‚Äôm still just fine using Trust and Cerberus+1 and Blast Furnace &amp;co.
---
As a PvP warlock main my only complaint about titans is the should charge lock on, I've seen people 180 me with that shit
---
eff that im throwing that in my tribute hall so i can finally get my Juju catalyst
---
Not the lunatra, whatever the rose turns into, and on that gun I was on the fire team leader step. For malfeasance I can‚Äôt recall, I don‚Äôt play a ton
---
You picked the chalace up right?
---
I didn‚Äôt, the thought hadn‚Äôt crossed my mind actually.
---
Find a clan. Clans can be very helpful.
---
Save everything. There's a new season around the corner with the promise of big changes. Changes that may or may not require you to use lots of materials. Better to save and see how it plays out.
---
Lastly, enjoy. Seriously, Destiny is a beautiful game. Just take a second to look at the backgrounds in the worlds and read the lore. There's alot put into the game that often gets overlooked.
---
Uldren and spider are way better waifus than mara and petra
---
The major bug was fixed, but yes sometimes two people put in charges at the same time and it locks up. You'll have to leave or go to orbit or something
---
Alternative title: when I‚Äôve spent hours trying to figure out what the hell this lorebook is talking about
---
yet here you are...lol (j/k)
---
God that thorn ornament is p2w, suuuuper salty I didn‚Äôt get it.
---
There are a lot or aspects of the game that aren't explained at the start. It helped me immensely to check youtube for not only the lore video stuff I missed from Destiny 1, and general tips and tricks. 
---
Oh and you can do a slide if you hit crouch while sprinting.

Pulled pork comes from the first games ghost grimoire cards, where he was the ghost described looking like that, and he was still looking for his guardian on Mars and some other places.
---
The darkness triangles but they are the light
---
Yeah, the colour scheme is very 'Traveler' but the 3 shapes floating in the sky reminded me of the Pyramid ships.
---
You don't...it's just to understand the universe...which almost all RPGs use a codex system and lots of writing to convey...Dragon age, mass effect...Witcher.....Elder Scrolls....even Fallout... you don't need them to understand the bare bones stuff, but a shit ton of games use this system to flesh out their world because it works.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs the best way to do it, I exclusively solo queue late at night to get more wins but it‚Äôs definitely not that fun. I‚Äôm around 1700.
---
Ded bois
---
i have 2 left
---
No problem. DM me if you need to talk about shit.
---
Nope, you wont be able to play together. Each platform can only be played with players coming from the same platform. Note that it is cross-save and not cross-play.
---
But if you meant you playing on PC
---
with your friends and then going offline and then your son comes online on PS4 at a different timing on the same account, then yes you can.
---
ü§î
---
Welcome and it's never too late!
---
The issue to me is rechargability and range, throwing knives have a massive range and while it is arguably harder to use them, if you can get them back on precision kills, get them back from a dodge that‚Äôs up roughly every 20 seconds, or even have a chest plate that gives you two and you get two back per dodge, it wouldn‚Äôt really matter how hard it is to use because if I miss I can just keep spamming them.
---
Welcome to a wonderful universe with a (sometimes) wonderful community!
---
I made a bunch of these and have been laughing all night!  Glad you enjoyed it, too
---
I think it‚Äôs always bright yellow
---
You can get ones that are connected via pcie
---
It's alright to like being an asshole. I always laugh hardest when I kill a group of people somewhat too easily. Like killing a guy with a Dragonfly weapon and his death taking out 2 more teammates. That's just funny to me.
---
Look at the two titans doing the dbz emote and one of them left me hanging
---
So the titan rally barricade is useless?  Or the fact that the middle void sub class has grenades that heals all allies.  
---
Hunters are the worst pve class.
---
Say it with me blackout is the stupidest modifier ever
---
Too much of a puss to fight guardians without immuning or bailing every half second
---
Hunters a more beneficial in a raid group, luna faction boots exist and a the most used warlock exotic, warlocks also have a healing nade so that doubles off 2 things titans have, hunters have the highest single target dmg super, the busted 1 - 2 punch combination blow strat that can literally solo raid bosses, tether, equally strong roaming super. The only thing titans have over them is mp but hunters have that on spectral when you melee an enemy with flawless execution active.
---
Spider is F A T with S T R E N G T H!
---
Congrats man, I havent seen a auto rifle kill in... many unspooked moons
---
Those emote....
---
Me every time when someone invades.
---
I don't even like hunters much (that's a different story though) and I must say I did this with a Hunter, except I was going after him and using my fist of panic and literally ran right by him and didn't even know üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
It's awful. Personally I normally hate when Bungie nerf weapons (especially if anyone else remembers the phase where they were just _constantly_ rebalancing weapons) but in this case I wouldn't be mad if they outright removed LoW. 
---
If they wanna keep it as is then it should be changed to a power weapon so at least the ammo economy will slow it down.
---
Not celestial damage, hunters have to burn an exotic to get that plus they have to land the crit shot (not difficult but it's not guaranteed like nova or thundercrash). The self-yeet missile should definitely be doing near the same damage as a novabomb though.
---
Riven: look mara i can do it only if the helmet stays on
---
Mara:‚Ä¶....deal 
---
Thus the lore was made
---
You could use any roaming ultimate just as another wave of ads spawn i used spectral blades and gwisin vest and its very easy like that
---
It's a 10% drop chance, not as impressive now
---
Hey that‚Äôs me in every raid üòù
---
Me - *runs Titan and thinks I don't need to use ammo 99% of the time and dies cause of it* Also me - "why don't you guys ever let me lead ?" My ENTIRE fireteam - *all starts yelling and bringing up old shit I've done as my Titan* üòÇüòÇüòÇ

[removed]
---
Oh no! You‚Äôve broken the stomp mechanic! .. did the game crash?
---
Just think about all the triumphs that he didn‚Äôt completed

Easier? Lumina.

Best? That's subjective.

Your submission has been removed in violation of Rule 13 - No Loot/Roll posts.

Great work Guardian! However loot posts are prohibited to prevent our subreddit from being cluttered (we get way too many!) - please keep these submissions in the weekly pinned loot/achievement thread. Thanks!

Cool - how long is the grind ?

That mark he‚Äôs wearing is new monarchy, he was 14 and I was 16 when he made it. It‚Äôs not perfect but it was modeled after the new monarchy armor

Search bar would assist you greatly. Tons of guides out there with much more content than I could fit in a comment.
---
Unfortunately i doubt anyone you are playing with will see this message or know how to even correlate your reddit name vs your battlenet id. Nice way to sneak in a rant post though. Very suave
---
This exists in-game? No shit? Jesus, this game is one step away from having shaxx wink at the player. It's impressive, even I don't really like these fourth-wall breaking stuff, but it is impressive.
---
He got resurected by darkness?
---
Show me some statistics or I win
---
Ace of spades is a very reliable HC. It works for almost all PVE and PVP activities. If you don't have it, I would definitely do that asap.
---
Well I guess it isn't a repost if I didn't steal it from OP
---
It's a bug, Bungie will fix it sooner or later (hope sooner \^\^).  
---
Next time bro, just use the search bar, or google "invisible crucible reddit" and you'll have all answers.
---
Eyes up Guardian !
---
Those are the best three comments I have ever read lol.
---
Your opinion. In my opinion, it wasn't the damage increase that solely made it op, it was that paired with the shield regen after a kill, which wasn't nerfed. If a titan manages to survive vs 2 enough to kill 1 of them, the second enemy is as good as dead. Now if you don't think that's OP....
---
Ok bro, you could just go Forsaken campaign, then forges, then oppulence (menagerie).
---
And if you like Gambit, you should try then Gambit Prime and justice (but light lvl counts, so you'll do it when you'll be 750).
---
I want the game to not be centered around hitting a button to activate an ability to win fights. I want a little more gunplay focus
---
I'm on 4 days game time right now, the grind for Ancient Apocalypse helmet is real just for the full set quest step.  Managed to grind Breakneck before getting it. Loving D2 though, got about 70 days on Rainbow Six Siege and D2's replaced it for me - Tangled Web is actually disgusting though, and it's all I'm getting.
---
Yes, question is, are they good enough primary‚Äôs to face against the hand cannons and pulse rifles...?
---
Loo they are power hungry teens my guy. They gotta get off somehow.
---
1. I meant Bannershield and Bubble, not melting point. Also, there are some bosses you can‚Äôt melting point, such as Xol, and some bosses where that‚Äôs straight up suicide. It‚Äôs also very gimmicky 
---
2: only if you‚Äôre in a very specific spot. Plus, warlock‚Äôs in addition get either a damage boost or a health regeneration boost, and it works for well of Radiance too.
---
3. Have fun making it infinite. Besides, we shouldn‚Äôt just be Add clear: the class.
---
4;  you seriously think we have the only AOE melees?
---
5: only on melee kills, and that‚Äôs hard to proc in harder activities. Meanwhile, Radiant Warlocks simply have to use their grenade.
---
6: its still a roaming super. Titans need a one-and-done super that does as much damage as a slowva bomb.
---
7: So? If you‚Äôre going with top tree Sentinel, chances are you‚Äôre probably gonna use bubble most of the time. And that‚Äôs extremely annoying when you accidentally cast Sentinel shield instead of bubble
---
8: so does middle tree arcstrider, except it REFLECTS the damage and you get a damage boost for doing so.
---
9: warlocks have longer range melee abilities, while also having the ability to OHK with any grenade with a voidwalker. And titans having more mobility than hunters? Get off the weed man.
---
That is some respect bro, i love it.
---
Colony ... What a cancer \^\^
---
But it worth the grind.
---
Eyes up Guardian, you'll have it !
---
Absolutely. One gun that takes down every shield.
---
Gotta get that G-fuel bro! (This is not an Ad) ü§£
---
One of my posts has gotten removed three times, despite 1.) not violating any rules and 
---
2.) getting another mod to approve the post and not only that
---
3.) getting a mod to vouch for me
---
Maybe you know, if I play 3 matches on all 3 characters do the weekly bonuses stack?
---
There‚Äôs always that one guy...
---
Well technically it is still a repost but I don‚Äôt care
---
What's with all the celestial nighthawk memes lately
---
As a warlock,I don‚Äôt rlly have a problem with titans,they might have some good stuff but warlocks and hunters do too, titans have the one hit melee but warlocks have the one hit grenade on nova warp, also hunters have some ridiculous supers for something like mayhem that titans can really match, like blade barrage has basically no counter because pretty much no shield can block it and if one of the shields does, then the explosion kills them anyway,  and tether is just unfair, so yeah I don‚Äôt have too big of a problem with titans, they can be annoying but I think they are kinda out classed especially in stuff outside of pvp,
---
I'll see you star side
---
I don't believe in the whole "8 in the mag is too little"-mantra, the weapon does just fine in PvE and a fast reload is easy enough to pull off if you want to actually use it. On Consoles, I feel like the problem in PvP isn't that there's "only" 8 bullets. Even with the Catalyst, it just feels too sluggish and awkward to use. More than other weapons with a similar rate of fire. Don't get me wrong, I love it, but I think I'd get murdered if I took it to PvP.
---
I want it back to where it was in D1, that would be perfecto
---
chief this is a MOOD also i love you for crediting me üíñ
---
That's General Zavala, veteran of the 3rd Dark age.. To you guardian! Now get out there AND WIN THAT WAR ON MARS!
---
No. Just did it all night while I was sleeping and im fine
---
Yes
---
Yeah but, doing it more than once \^\^
---
Guardians are subject to bodily deterioration if they never get revived. 
---
Drifter looks old because he probably hasn‚Äôt died in a few hundred years for example.
---
I also did it yesterday while I was at school
---
Exactly! I loved the prestige Exotic bond/cloak/mark you could get from each from maxing them out. I think it would be fairly easy to implement in D2, and I‚Äôm sure tons of people would be all for such a change now that the exclusive catalysts can be obtained elsewhere.
---
probably somewhere between the tower and the reef
---
r/destinyfashion not here
---
Yeahyeahyeah BOOOOOYYYYYY
---
Thank you ! \^\^
---
CLUELESS
---
So if he did die and got resurrected, he would look younger?
---
Why would someone who criticizes people and wishes eternal pain and suffering after death for them, just on the first thing they know about them, not go to hell, seriously, the bible even says ‚ÄúDo not judge others, and you will not be judged‚Äù Mathews 7:1, so according to that logic, you would also go to hell because you judge us just because we are different than you
---
His ghost could probably make him younger at any time, just like it said it could fix his hunger.
---
I use revoked in pvp sometimes gives a bullet back after a kill and I use beloved with tactical mag no distractions and fourth times the charm can fire 10 shots without reloading if you hit crits got a demolitionist fourth times the charm but didn‚Äôt have a perk to up the mag
---
Of course you get banned for idle farming.
---
1: Because someone didn't get banned get.     doesn't mean you should do it
---
2: It takes the fun for other players because you take a spot which leads to them having problems since they are only 2 in a 3 man activity.
---
3: Just play the game and earn your light levels instead of idleing smh
---
Dodging is worthless except for the instant reload/melee recharge. It doesn't have any i-frames, so you're just giving the enemy a free shot if you use it in a firefight.
---
That‚Äôs destiny 2 mods for ya.
---
This is the only instance I would endorse ddossing/hacking just to fuck with that guy. People like him don't deserve internet.
---
See! We can help us sharing our builds, that one with click run on the paddle feels great
---
Search bar.
---
Rarely. If you manage to get the entire team. One Eyed isn't a super exotic. It's a item that gives you health and oversheild.
---
Ok. I was trying to figure out if my Chattering Bone could 2 Burt with kill clip and apparently it can if they have 6 resilience or less.
---
Yeah. Especially when using it in the Fanatic strike at the end. Just wiping those ads. It‚Äôs really therapeutic.
---
amd tracking
---
No, Hard Light is definitely NOT a beast.
---
It's fun for a couple of PvP matches, but that's it.
---
Nice try on the clickbait title.
---
I think it‚Äôs a beast üòÇ it‚Äôs fun to use and good
---
It's nowhere comparable to Nova bomb damage. Nova barely even comes close and bottom tree gunslinger is fully optimized for super regen, so you often get multiple Nighthawks per damage phase. Nova bomb is just better for add clear.
---
Put in perspective, on Argos, a tractor cannoned Nova bomb does a little over 200k, and a nighthawk with no buffs does 390k.
---
Ya if you still in D1 go back and watch his old lore videos, it will really build the universe for you and when it‚Äôs more like a audio book and pieced together it‚Äôs much less daunting then trying to sort it out and reed it all yourself.
---
Big explode one. You may also see it referred to as ‚Äúslowva‚Äù cause it‚Äôs the slow nova bomb
---
The shards buff stacks exponentially with other super buffs so in mayhem/blind well/final found of Primeval it instantly fills the bar. The halfway max isn't a hard cap, it's just that the buff's base regen rate and duration was adjusted so with only shards it's half.

---
This would be all of the lore from Destiny 1 leading up to Destiny 2
---
Crucible was fine, Gambit is taking its time.
---
If you look at lfg currently it's something along the lines of "100 clears, must have recluse, must have mountaintop, must have seal" bloody ridiculous
---
Yeah, but it isn't really.
---
If you're using an exotic auto rifle in PvP, SUROS Regime should be the obvious choice.
---
Eventually I will learn what this means and remember this comment.
---
3 prime engrams, edge transit, edge transit, oh look, another edge transit
---
Nighthawk gives 33% back guaranteed on kill and Practice Makes Perfect synergizes with Bad Juju for really good uptime but you HAVE to get the kill. It also requires a precision hit for max damage. Shards returns energy ON HIT, doubles as good add clear, and is more forgiving but doesnt have the same damage potential. Shards is definitely the best pick for the Final Round though.
---
Nah king slayer looked so much cleaner
---
Huh TIL
---
damn, that's about as far from the meta as you could get without a sidearm. gj and congrats on fabled. hope you grinded out the mountaintop kills before this though
---
I like this idea.
---
Yep that's what I figured. Couldn't remember what two paths were called lol. Thanks!
---
nnnice
---
Depends on the raid but generally well of radiance with Lunafaction boots is best for warlock, tether or celestial nighthawk golden gun for hunter, and melting point Titan.
---
Will doing the menagerie get me better gear? My main issue is I don‚Äôt know what stuff is current and I keep spending hours working on a quest line to be rewarded with level 400 blues
---
i really wish console had fov settings...
---
Girl same i vibe. Im super into puzzle platformers because the mechanics and general gameplay is easy to pick up on. I love bonding this way!
---
lmao
---
sup kyle
---
I LOVE YOU RANDOM CITIZEN
---
If your main goal is to get your power level up, your main focus should be any activities that reward "Powerful Gear." Do these activities each week. Then, they reset on Tuesday so you can do them again.
---
I'm not sure if you've done the question, "The Invitation" yet, but if you haven't, do that first. That's basically a Power Level boost quest that will take you to 690. Once you get to 690, you can do the Powerful Gear activities that I mentioned above. 
---
You are confused because it sounds like you missed 3 different Seasons, so you are getting activities for all 3 of those seasons.
---
The seasons are:
---
\-Season of Opulence (Any activities with a chalice in the top left)
---
\-Season of the Drifter (Any activities with a flower like shape in the top left)
---
\-Black Armory (Hard to explain this icon, but it just... Well, doesn't look like the other 2)
---
I'd focus on all the Season of Opulence stuff first. This will help get you back into the swing of things. Then, you can focus on whatever you want next. I did Black Armory after Opulence because Gambit Prime doesn't sound very fun.
---
If you have extra time, I'd suggest looking up "Season of Opulence guide" before you start Season of Opulence stuff. Then look up, "Season of the Drifter guide" before you do that stuff, etc. etc.
---
This will help give you a better idea of what's included in each season. Just keep playing. Focus on one thing at a time, and it will all come together. 
---
Also, I'm sorry, I just realized now you are PL 693. So you have done "The Invitation." At this point, just focus on Opulence and Powerful Gear stuff, then you can work on the other 2 seasons you missed.
---
I mean if that‚Äôs your main then do everything but prioritize, menagerie WAS good to boost but they nerfed it but it‚Äôs still fun and easy after awhile, your best bet tho is your weekly‚Äôs because there‚Äôs just so many of them, save all that extra stuff for when you‚Äôve done everything else
---
It was a bad super. Thought they were gonna make a push.
---
just focus on anything that has powerful engrams as a reward, if you need a clan and are on PS4 mine is open to anyone of any experience level we got some good guys that have been playing since day 1
---
This game sometimes demands that you sometimes look things up. Don't be afraid to do that. I've looked up SO much stuff since I came back. Definitely just look up what a pursuit is if you are confused. This is very important because there is so much stuff in the game.
---
I miss it. And need it fro my collection..I have a taken ship and sharrow. I neeeeed my ghost.
---
She got shit to do man
---
Ah, a man of culture!
---
Juju counts as a leviathan exotic?
---
Thank you this is perfect, you‚Äôre exactly correct I quit right after I finished the warmind campaign and just came back a few days ago and all the seasonal stuff is quite overwhelming
---
Maybe I‚Äôm just crazy but I could‚Äôve sworn back in the day you could just grind public events on any planet to get to the ‚Äúsoft cap‚Äù but every public event I do is dropping 375 to 425 blues which are complete garbage.  I‚Äôll just stick to the dailies and weeklies and stuff with cups on the corner!  lol thanks again.

Im not saying i do did or will. But the kid that caused these memes to pop up? I did find his IP address and( Redacted. )

Anywho.
---
yep, felt dat.
---
Why do i see every titan saying they dont use OEM except hunter mains except I see titans only using OEM and still plenty of hunters????
---
Primeval Slayer ‚Ä¢ ~5 + Shards of Galanore. Literally infinite super.
---
What...? That is kinda weird, actually... like if the game was like *ummmm wich one do I summon first...?*
---
I'm pretty sure it does punch through it but it takes a heavy toll on your damage so it's not really worth it

Oh, I have seen a lot of banner shields die blade barrage so I just figured that it didn‚Äôt do a good job blocking it, mostly because the explosion would hit them I think
---
It‚Äôs a pulse rifle from Gambit. There was a quest a while back where you could get a curated roll of it from the Drifter. I find it to be really consistent, which is good for PvP. I‚Äôm not sure you can get the curated roll from him anymore though
---
I mean, maybe. But, I'm sure they'll pull through though content will pretty much start out how D2 started out: EMPTY.
---
I am extremely new to this game. And holy christ I hate that gun so much. I don't even really understand what kind of weapon it is. Is it a shotgun or a burst? Secondly i don't really understand a lot of this game but damn I cannot get enough of it.
---
oH.  Well, I didn't see that post.  That person would be a dick for doing that.
---
Does free to play games requiere plus as well?
---
But if you can spam it literally the entire round, you‚Äôre getting more damage. Trust.
---
My guess is that what D3 would have been will get rolled into D2Y4~6
---
Oh ya another hunter thing that got needed to death.
---
That‚Äôs unfortunate in its own right, but if you are trying to get these triumphs, you can still use the opulent gear from the menagerie to make progress!
---
I play a lot and probably average an exotic a week, including when I get new ones from Xur (as he doesn‚Äôt always have anything new for me anymore). 
---
Most of my exotic drops recently have come from Gambit and Crucible. I think can count on one hand the number of times I‚Äôve gotten a random world exotic just out in the world. Mine have all come from powerful and prime engrams
---
Well, I mean, that'd be cool too. Not as great as having another game, with possible better changes, but budget running low I guess.....maybe, idk.
---
Try it again. Make sure your knives are hitting a single target. Profit.
---
They can't just give it to you, you have to take it!
---
You just gave this sub a new meme format
---
Lmao I am so new, that is what I have been using.... Hand cannons are my favorite then snipers. What should I be grinding for as far as PVP weapons go?
---
Makes sense! Thanks!
---
The scourge one
---
Maaaaaayyyybe
---
So much sadness lol had a meatball boop me back while throwing knives and I hit the top of our portal.....RIP
---
I need the vigil of heroes cape for my hunter but cant get it... I've gotten 6 arms 7 legs 3 helmets and 3 chest pieces as well as a billion of the weapons but no cape. Also have 4 full sets of scatterhorn and tangled web gear xD
---
Sure! Follow[this](https://www.bungie.net/en/ClanV2?groupid=278102) to the Bungie site to join!
---
It‚Äôs not a big clan or anything like that. The NA side is very relaxed and casual, with the occasional flair up of ‚Äúsweat-e-ness‚Äù. I am sure the EU side is the same.
---
For sure, I‚Äôd be livid if that happened to me.
---
I can't confirm this, but I believe the sparrow you get from using 200 runes in the menagerie is the best handling sparrow in the game. Best looking is the ghost Rider looking one. Best exhaust is the sparrow from doing the memories of Mars.
---
Trevor‚Äôs uncle
---
In comp, you gotta play dirty. Do you remember when teams would have all but 1 member jump off an edge just to revive for the super energy in Trials?
---
I feel like being sweaty in comp type stuff is to be expected. But seeing a 6 stack in QP running NF and shotties or Erentils is...ridiculous. Ran into a 6 stack last night that had at least 4/6 using Erentil. They started losing and all put on Telesto. Still lost. Some players rely on the meta, even if it's becoming outdated.
---
So 3 matches in a row against clanners with yellows is fair? Just checking..
---
It looks pretty good I like the taken theme and the name fits perfectly! Keep it up!
---
ah yeah.... I encountered one like that just the other day, I was legit in need of finishing a black armory bounty and this one guy was just farming at 750.... usually I would get pissed but, I needed the kills anyway so.... eh. Never ran into 'em again anyway **shrug**
---
Woah.
---
no problem people make mistakes
---
Me dying in flawless menagerie
---
Very cool user flair.
---
Dreaming city, get the last bounty from petra and it will have you complete the blind well a minimum of 2 times on teir 3 it will give u a offering just take it to the queen.
---
people think menagerie is bad? theyre nuts
---
RickCactus here

Try /r/fireteams

I had that happen to be the other day and I laughed my balls of because I didn't know that was a thing.  And I please a lot of crucible lol.

Always a great addition to the desk!

Yo if possible could you tell me which ones?

Always

You probably want to activate drop mag. It‚Äôs great on this roll.
---
r/punpatrol YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!
---
There is no "best" sparrow but the exotic one are a bit faster and 'Speed Demon' is a perk to look for but other than that its all personal preference. Aside from that some of my favorite sparrows are Vespulaser, Always on Time, Azure Azazyel, G35 Anseris Overdeive, Winchesters Ruin, Harbingers Echo, The Bronco, SV112 Predator, and Blood in the Water.
---
Um.... yes.... you can one shot most things in this game... with a bow.
---
Yes.
---
I main hunter and only bought oem from xur bcuz if I ever do decide to go back I would like to have the best PvP exotic in the game
---
That and annual pass.
---
I hate how well lord of wolves just fits into the last frame.
---
This is dumb. Gets my upvote.
---
I do that from time to time, but its not something i need to do.
---
Afk farming forges???
---
No problem
---
Do a scan and repair, it should sort it out.
---
Just don‚Äôt forget the cayde statue.
---
Luna‚Äôs howl isn‚Äôt any good anymore unless ur on console, then it‚Äôs ok. It‚Äôs honestly not worth the grind, but u do u man.
---
Yes, i have both of those. Thanks alot!
---
Ace, Thorn, Lumina were all just fine. Malfeasance as well.
---
Last Word has a component where PvP losses takes away progress. This was ok as well, just had to play a bit more on my belly. 
---
I have them all. 
---
Signed,
---
I am not good at PvP at all.
---
people are gonna run out of ammo real fuckin quick tho, thats the issue
---
How did I know
---
Do you happen to have the base game on disc?
---
It's a singular downvote, and it wasnt me.
---
play of the game with proximity grenades
---
Digital, not disc.
---
OK did you delete forsaken by itself and redownload it?
---
Hahaha lol, that‚Äôs true
---
I know what you mean. I hate seeing people playing in QP running meta weapons.
---
Multiple times yes
---
Not at all. Just have fun, you'll be top light before  Shadowkeep arrives.
---
Sorry man idk then
---
You're not wrong.  That is why I was looking into the forge. But truly had no idea how to access it.
---
Take a look at the lore on Loaded Weapon too... Cayde had a loadout...
---
I need it
---
Titans are underpowered in my opinion but there still my favorite
---
Surprised that it's not blade barrage or spectral blade
---
I feel so bad for you on that one
---
Don't forget the desolate armor set.
---
Accurate, including the teeth at the end as well
---
I could almost hear the "LEEETS GO!!"
---
When you fired up the gilded gun.
---
Totally. I forget that until I play with someone new and remember how many things have been added over the years.
---
i only did it to begin with for bad juju, now i do it for the catalyst
---
Sorry mine belong to Borderlands, still cool background though
---
I think they were referring to how bungie is no longer contractually obligated to make 4 games in like 10 years
---
Area 51 would be a sick destiny location.
---
I don‚Äôt even have a desire for bad juju. Didn‚Äôt use it in d1 at all. But good god y‚Äôall must be dedicated for the catalyst. Good luck with it.
---
In case this isn't sarcasm, shooting 1k at anything closer than 10m is not smart. Matter of fact, 1k should not be used at all in Petra's run
---
Oh God aeon armor doesn't cap I Don't think so we'll have infinite class abilities. Finally a use for aeon exotics
---
i would stick around on Titan. Mars can get delayed by EP instances and it would piss me off bad haha.
---
But you need to stand on the plates to take the shields off the crystals and then shoot them. When the wizards spawn, do the same thing with them.
---
I bought Cades for $10 on Prime day. I‚Äôm happy with it.
---
Limit breaker!
---
Gang gang bruh them alien can come get this hitta
---
Not everybody is amazing at crucible, myself included, so this grind is very very difficult.
---
Oh do i have something for you to watch

I‚Äôve only got one hive left to do going to do the 25 medal kills for crucible first can‚Äôt wait to get this done it‚Äôs my first exotic quest, he‚Äôll of a grind
---
im 15 off rn most of mine came from the destinations page
---
thought so, thanks for replying.
---
Locked for comments cuz it just turned into a never ending line of people lighting their torches
---
Oh boy well last word is is pretty easy compared to some others. Some of the harder one are thorn. Last word is fantastic in crucible and probably the worst exotic possible in PVE. I can guarantee a lot of rare hand cannons would outperform it
---
