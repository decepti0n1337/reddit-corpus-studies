Which actively cannibalized old content. I was half way through an ascended armor set when HoT hit. They upset all the farming, WvWvW was still a pile of garbage after the failed map change, I was enjoying dungeons when they nerfed those into the ground, and then they wanted more money from me on top of that to get the content to restore my ability to farm back to pre-HoT levels.
---
You know it's bad if you quit a game to go back to EVE "Spreadsheets" Online.
---
EDIT: More to the point here, I would worry that Bungie would internalize the need for cash, moving the toxic management priorities closer to the creative core of the team. That spells franchise and studio death.
---
---
---
Seems like a normal black armory to me 
---
Yeah, but it never said anywhere its a one per account quest. I always start the week with the character that needs the most work. Luckily that character had a rare bounty
---
The only reason I want D3 is so that console players can finally move off of 30 FPS. This might sound stupid to some people, but a big reason I stopped playing destiny in 2018 is because I couldn‚Äôt stand playing games running at 60-144 FPS (sometimes I game on PC) to 30 FPS on the console version. Almost all next gen shooters run smoothly at 60 FPS on Xbox one/ps4, and lagging behind at 30 makes the game feel choppy and outdated. 
---
I recently downloaded destiny 2 for free on PC and it is a completely different game. A much more enjoyable experience, but as someone who played since the release of D1 on Xbox, It isn‚Äôt the same playing without friends. 
---
:) 
---
Publishers still have a lot of input on development when it comes to monetizing the game after launch (ie Eververse, Season Pass, DLC). Activision has publicly stated that Destiny is not making for them, the kind of money they had hoped, which if I am reading between the lines correctly mean that they see the millions of idiots buying worthless skins for Fornite and are wondering why real gamers aren't spending the same kinda coin on Destiny.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Hopefully this means Bungie can create content without pressure to include incentives for players to keep dumping cash into the game.
---
Is it still september 2018?
---
That man is no lord! Outrageous! Strip him of his title immediately. O said GOOD DAY
---
Hopefully they stay independent.  Although Id love to see old school Xbox players reactions if Sony bought them lol. Realistically gaming as a whole would be better with a independent bungie
---
Mesa free
---
‚ÄúI complain to nerf anything fun‚Äù
---
I don‚Äôt hate PlayStation but saying it‚Äôs better because exclusives is kinda dumb, I mean Xbox has exclusives too and then being able to play them on pc is actually cool and some of the Xbox exclusives are just as good if not better than some PlayStation exclusives we have the master chief collection with remastered graphics that we can switch on the fly, and you can‚Äôt tell me that the scene when master chief kicked the covenant bomb into the ships core wasn‚Äôt badass, on top of halo CE through ODST we have crackdown three coming soon, I heard cuphead was good never played it though, sea of thieves, sunset overdrive which I loved, and on top of all this with the game pass all exclusives are free along with others games. Again I don‚Äôt hate PlayStation my favorite game of all time was on the ps2.
---
Potentially terrified, this could end up being great or terrible.
---
Nice.
---
Day 1 player here, still kickin' around, but hear me out. I've seriously been losing more and more interest in my longest lasting hobby as time goes on.  
---
Not anymore- all the fuck aboard this hype train. I'm almost 30, Bungie Studios has been pivitol in my gaming interests. Halos 1-3 have more time played than I have even CLOSE in Destiny because they were each so individually revolutionary.  
---
I used to feel the same way about Destiny, especially in the first year. ESPECIALLY when they used to change crucible on a regular basis. That was really what it was- a crucible. Regular and community driven patches forced regular power shifts in PvP and you had to adapt or sink.  
---
Same with the Raids, after the... let's say "volatile"... release of vanilla, the devs listened and boom. Dark Below. The best era in pve content imo (shout out to the sword swingers that glitched the bridge). Same with the community, most everything being positive.  
---
Now Year 2 in comparison just feels so.... corporate? With all the Eververse bs (same goes in Y1, no lies there) and silver driven loot it feels like Bungie's been forced to listen to the money instead of the people.  
---
I hope this changes that- I think it will! hype HYPEE  
---
Tl;dr Dark Below 2.0 please
---
Eyes up, guardians. We may be heading towards a bright future! 
---
Who's complaining, I PVP with shards all the time
---
Movement aside, at least 140s and 150s are *useable* in PvP for PC guys. I'd love to see the usage numbers for 140/150 handcannons on console in the crucible.... that aren't named Ace of Spades
---
I feel like the only reason to buy a console is for the exclusives. I play D2 on PC. 
---
This exact post has been made multiple times, every day, for like 3 weeks. Maybe bungie can find a way to let people know in game about known bugs
---
I love every thing about this post üòç
---
Holy shit, I just had a minor heart attack lmao
---
I dont even have the 35 bucks for forge 
---
Specifically it was NetEase, who have a partnership with Blizzard.  https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1083474638401880064 
---
It's a recent thing for me, I got a new job in November and finally was able to buy forsaken plus the pass and everything haha!
---
This is amazing. I want the old Bungie back.  I hope this works out.
---
Wonder what this means for the future of the franchise

Thats like me but i only yell at OEM scrubs

Well said

I started working on the quest steps for Redrix and Luna‚Äôs recently because I hit 650 on my Hunter. I‚Äôm very familiar with the frustration of getting stomped by career PvP players, but I‚Äôve also gotten better over the last two weeks. Shotguns are still the devil incarnate, and fuck Telesto users, but I‚Äôve found a place in Rumble of all places. It helps that I‚Äôm trying to come in first every game, just third or better so I don‚Äôt lose my streak. Manageable goals. 
---
Bruh
---
Why?
---
Idk lol, just is 
---
Hm. I haven‚Äôt played in a bit honestly just curious why people sound so pissed haha. Outside in perspective this sounds kinda cool that people are so stumped for now
---
I wouldn't get your hopes up. It's only with two other studios helping them and playing major roles in Destiny's development that we've gotten things like Forsaken. And even now it still takes months at a time for us to even get updates. 
---
Now High Moon and VV won't be helping with anything going forward, and Bungie themselves are working on a new IP so their attention is going to be split. 
---
Sooo yeah. 
---
Izanagi's Burden quest, not the quest to unlock Izanami Forge. 
---
How does radiance work?
---
Me too. No Vex Mythoclast or Icebreaker stood in my way
---
I tried that on my warlock not knowing that you don't need to unlock the forge on the other characters like the 1st 3 forges. It seem to drop quickly with the weekly powerful bounty in the new Lab. You can try and see if it works for you.  It didn't work for me until I switched characters and did my weekly bounty. Good Luck man and let me know if it worked for you. 
---
Not arguing but genuinely asking .. specifically how was activision hindering bungee ? 
---
Oh you know it!!...
---
It increases the damage of that weapon while in any of the forges. 
---
what?
---
I never really understood how anyone has the time to go back into the ps4 GUI, look up a player, type using the controller when they could just move on to the next match. 
---
Their loss, our gain imo 
---
I mean from what I know they are expanding upon the Darkness that is mentioned here and there during Forsaken. 
---
I nut big
---
I hope you find the happiness you seek Guardian. Good luck out there! 
---
Just look whats happening to ALL Blizzard games right now, theyre literally dying off. If I were Bungies Chef I wouldve made the same decision, not only does Activision have a bad reputation they also fuck everything up because all they care about is the cash, not the Community, and thats what hurts a game more than anything.
---
i upvoted you, you big dummy .
---
I actually liked it. It was fun.
---
Did they just give the "new" CFO a 15 million dollar bonus or was that another publisher? 
---
Late reply oof. Really tho? Interestiiiiing.
---
*BUT ZAVALA-* 
---
Why a flowchart? Being that Titan's fists are the most powerful weapons in the universe and would blow anyone's head clean off. Our enemies should ask themselves, if they feel lucky that it isn't a titan. Well, do they?
---
Nope, not a bit. It‚Äôs a Servitorish meatball with a mouth. You just have to shoot the little drones that shield it and blast it dead. Pretty fun actually
---
Rambo. Pretty new to pc myself. Hit me up and we will play. GT: Murvul
---
They popped up after the Bergusia Forge was unlocked. I did see another post about it but it got lost in the shuffle, as do most posts on the subreddit.
---
Hey...that is a great idea. I never thought of that before. Thanks!
---
I went with pointing out how moronic and pathetic you are. Seems like you're triggered and now you're running away. Get a life and quit being such a loser. And move out of your parent's basement, it's not helping you. 
---
I‚Äôm definitely interested to see where the game goes but I don‚Äôt have high hopes. If Destiny ends up improving though I will gladly pay money to support them if they end up having to charge us more. 
---
Interesting.  Personally I feel the microtransactions are rather well done (talking about Tess here, not DLCs etc).  You get plenty of freebies, and they're all cosmetics (no P2W elements) from the same pool as the paid items.  There might be some that are only in exclusive paid boxes, like the Thunderlord ornaments.  Compare to Rocket League for example, in RL you get pretty crappy looking free cosmetic drops on leveling up, with the option to buy paid loot crate-exclusive items.  $0.99 per pull with a very low drop rate on cool items.  There's also a "Rocket Pass", which gives cooler items upon leveling up in addition to the freebies, at the cost of $10 for a 3 month season.  I feel that's pretty fair, but compared to D2, D2 seems way more generous.
---
Seeing how things play out, I'd have no issue supporting Bungie again if they release some cool paid cosmetic items.  I'm only speaking for myself here though, and I took a big break between vanilla D2 and Forsaken.  I may have missed some drama.
---
*"How's our stocks?"*
---
This was what I was thinking too. Let's also not forget it was Bungie's fault curse of Osiris dlc was horribly short and a bad story, not Activision's.
---
Why thank you. I appreciate it.
---
Yeah I read that ending like it was DragonBall Z. And if I learned anything from watching it, we're gonna have to sit through a couple of "filler" versions before we get to the good part. Destiny 12 baby, I'm ready for ya! 
---
Who‚Äôs goin anywhere sweetheart? I‚Äôm with you till the end, through every 0.21 kid game you have you can lean on me &lt;3
---
I thought this was an announcement for new crab type enemies.
---
Getting rid of Inactive-Vision is great but giant crab monsters are better.
---
Blizzard, follow their example please
---
more like Bungo underestimated our ability to make connections from a simple image
---
sweetvictory.mp4
---
Exactly the release schedule was Activision keeping them on track(and pockets lined). But the content was all Bungie
---
The forsaken campaign isn‚Äôt hard at all. The raid at the very end is kind of a pain in the ass, but there‚Äôs still plenty to do
---
Use old
---
i cant really do raids since i dont have many friends who game, and also my sleep schedule is insane, sometimes my "day" starts at 9pm and sometimes at 11am... 
---
Yeah you could play all the Halo games back to back in one sitting but could you play Knack? How about Knack2? I could play all the Knack games streamed to my phone, laptop, or PS Vita and knack it up wherever I go in one sitting. 
---
Link to the song? 
---
Alright, which fire team completed this Raid first????
---
Thank u, next
---
I don‚Äôt raid either, not my thing. I still enjoy it. You don‚Äôt miss much üôÇ
---
This post flies in the face of your username.
---
eh, all i really want from my Playstation days is MGS4 
---
Great guide, good editing. But if you're serious about this YouTube or at the very least plan to keep making content, which I think you do. Please for the love of god invest in a better mic. 
---
I love the editing, but again a gear video hampered by meh audio. Another thing I think you could've done a bit better was spotlight the drone locations for the maximum temper better. You cut to them zoomed with not much context on their location. 
---
Besides all that id rate 8/10. Docking 2 for audio and aforementioned drone thing. You've earned a subscription from me friend. Keep it up.
---
Nope. Take all the time you could want/need.
---
Each Halo game gave us a 10 hour campaign and multiplayer, and it still took them years to put that out. Not exactly a shining endorsement of what they can do for a game like destiny. 
---
And quality? Really? Go look at every other shooter out there and see how often they release patches. This has been something the community has long since noted and crucified Bungie for. 
---
Yeah I haven't had a rare bounty drop since the doc dropped. 
---
 I have done 15 augmented weapons, 30 daily bounties, 6 weekly bounties, 6 powerful frames, and the new forge 29 times and still no rare bounty.
---
What shader is that?
---
So is anyone ready if the game actually gets worse and we start to despise destiny
---
Have you tried the Zedge app? I get all of my text and ringtones from there.
---
Never gotten below 1.5 k/d*, game is just a bunch of morons running around with shotguns, probably like you. And you're going nowhere in life? Believe me, I know. Still you should try and get out of the basement, it's not healthy. Just the fact that you post endlessly on D1 and D2 subs tells me what a loser you are. You actually think these games are good enough to dedicate time to lmao. So sad. 
---
They have some great Destiny wallpapers as well.
---
Wow just wow
---
Very good.  I‚Äôm excited.  If Bungie has very high confidence in future projects they‚Äôre working on now (Destiny 3?), then that would have had a huge part in their decision to dump Activision.  I trust Bungie‚Äôs creative talent more.
---
yYyYyYyEEAHHHHHH
---
For the love of god!!!! Now make D2 a play anywhere title or PC migrate 
---
Do you have to have bergusia forge unlocked for this to drop?
---
##GUARDIANS MAKE THEIR OWN FATE
---
hecc that was good
---
ITS COMING SOON ENOUGH
---
god fuCKING DAMMIT
---
Well they're self publishing, so really there's nothing stopping them from making a standalone launcher, maximize profits and all that.
---
Duke Nukem Forever took almost 10 years to be released. So you are going to a bit of an extreme. Bungie waiting an extra month or two to release an update or dlc is very different to waiting several years. And imo waiting an extra month or so is no big deal as long as it is of good quality. 
---
Can someone explain to me why this is good ? And or bad? I haven‚Äôt been apart of the destiny community long enough to understand any impacts this might have
---
Now if it comes to Steam, I might buy it.
---
MW3 was the beginning of the end. The most blatantly copy pasted cod imo. 1 and 2 were fucking bomb tho
---
Sweaty tess! Ill take that!
---
Xol's cousin
---
That‚Äôs fair but most major studios these days don‚Äôt seem to do that from Paradox, to Sega, and Ubisoft. My guess is Bungie might cut losses there and sell it through some third party. Could potentially make the whole process smoother for them. 
---
Prestige and normal Levi looked best, followed by IB, imo. The ornaments were a great addition.
---
W√≤ooooooooooooo made my day !!!!!!!!!!!

---
Thanks man :)
---
Awesome thanks for this. Haven't played since the xpac and just saw the news. So didn't know what that means for me as a player. Who hasn't engaged in the xpac yet. Cool to see this update though. 
---
Ubisoft does have their own launcher though (Uplay)
---
Amazing, appreciate the reply and the clarity of what happens with the current game. 
---
Oohhh, ok, thanks:). 
---
Let's hope they can shine even brighter now that they're rid of Activision then. 
---
Well fuck me with Shaxx‚Äôs missing horn I forgot. 
---
But they do still sell their product on steam right? I could‚Äôve sworn I saw promotions for Oddesy on the front page.
---
Today is a great day my friends
---
We could give a few matches a try for sure.
---
Only problem is my glory is 1600 which means it'll bump your average opponent Way up in skill level, most of the people I see already have NF, which is dumb tbh.
---
Got it, thanks
---
‚ÄúNeedless to say, I sent that bitch packing.‚Äù
---
Log out of bnet and then come back in, same thing happened to me when I got gifted bo4
---
In light of this news, I will give Destiny 2 another go. Good call, Bungie.
---
explain your joust , do tell
---
Sure, it's easier now, I have no reason to doubt you. It's just that it's easier now, four years after I quit to return to the spreadsheet simulator. From the perspective of someone who was playing and happy with the base game, I had a bunch of play that was nerfed, then a pile of content to replace or supplant it dropped behind a paywall. Call me crazy, but I was rather upset that they so radically changed a game I had bought not that long ago, and now they demanded another $30 to continue on my objective? No thanks.
---
If you don't understand why I was irritated, that's fine. But keep your apologies to /r/Guildwars2. I don't patronize that sub anymore because there's a bunch of people there who are excited about the game, and it's not appropriate to detract from that in their sub. 
---
Back to the topic at hand, that's the thing I worry about happening in D2. New content is fine, but if you let it depreciate your existing content you're going to have issues, especially if the new content is paywalled. Don't devalue what someone has already bought, add value to new content. If someone doesn't have a season pass they ought not feel like their progress is slower when some new content is released. Otherwise what you have is really just a soft subscription model.
---
Bungie and Activision are no longer working on Destiny together, it will be independently published by Bungie
---
I tried it in Gambit. DEFINITELY a favorite of mine now.
---
Hunter
---
Tried all 3 classes in the first mission and because I came from other FPS games such as csgo, overwatch etc I just couldn't work out the warlok and Titan jump.

Been sticking with my lovely hunter since CoO and just yesterday hit 650
---
Luckyyyyyyy

I doubt it.

Don't get me wrong, I expect it to be less invasive, but it's absolutely staying in a big form

My understanding is that the rewards are available to the first team to solve the puzzle. Is that not the case?

---
&gt;I hope you are banned for awhile. Going AFK in competitive is an automatic loss for anybody that matches up with you. Real shitty thing to do.
---
but how can I understand how long I am blocked, if nothing is written about it?
---
Really? You gathered from the information available, that this was going to be a content dropped aimed solely at the hardcore players? With nothing for casual players at all? That the content would be level gated and not even playable on day one? That the content would then be time gated, just to spread it out and make it look like more. That the only real content was new weapons and a match made activity akin to EP or Blind Well? That there would be no new playable space? Hell, isn't a new planet considered content? That isn't story. No, this was NOT as advertised.
---
Finally kicked em to the curb, MDGA!!
---
Blizzard is next up!!! Cmon lads you can do it!
---
I dont get why everyone is so happy. Bungie owned 51% of the partnership if im not mistaken. Which means all the bullshit we've dealt with was on them.
---
What am i missing here? You guys think micro transactions are going to go away? You think theyll make their deadlines with a now depleted dev team?
---
Im lost
---
Not at all.
---
Tmk in d2 the funds don't just go directly back into the development if the game (as was originally intended in d1). Assuming they reduced her scummyness (or just left her the same) they'd probably be making more profits off of her.
---
With how Activision is...I'd imagine their cut of funds raised are pretty steep. Bungie will be worse off money wise for sure, but that'll be made up for with employee moral (in terms of development) and somewhat via being able to take all the cash generated from the IP (bar cuts from stores and the like)
---
Honestly what I expect to happen is we stop seeing these COD style campaigns and see something much more Halo Reach esk. What I mean there is less demanding cut scenes/in engine stuff, stuff like that. Some cut corners for cost savings.
---
TL;DR - Worse off in some ways, vastly better off in others.
---
Detroit become human? I thought that game was excellent. 
---
Gives Bungo full reign to do whatever they want with the game. Changes how micro transactions, branding, content release and QOL changes are going to be going into Destiny 3. 
---
Problem being you get it from tess. If she wasn't a thing, it'd be gained through in game sources... they'd be things for achievers rather then the ones merely lucky enough.
---
There's hope for the future... 
---
Ok you hang on to all that bitterness and vitriol and see how far it gets you
---
My mistake, thanks for the insight.
---
u/Alovon11 He did the thing you said.
---
There are literally no game mechanics which funnel you toward micro transactions in this game?
---
Ever verse is practically non existent these days
---
Want some fries with that salt?
---
What people seem to be missing is that this is a direct result of Chinese mobile developer NetEase buying a 100mill stake in Bungie a few months ago. In light of that I seriously doubt that this will mean less micro transactions for destiny.
---
It would be a day or two later. They could have just released it later and it would be the same.

---
Blizzard still operates as their own company, but the parent has oversight and can influence decisions. But it‚Äôs not like Activision Blizzard decides every single thing that happens at Blizzard.
---
Either by trying to engage with equally skilled players to build a consistent team to reach either Luna or Not forgotten. Or generally by setting a goal. 100-400 Points a Day. 
---
It wouldn‚Äôt be a big deal except if we don‚Äôt get a rare bounty on our mains this week we have to wait 3 weeks for shattered throne... 
---
Maybe Destiny 3? I think not having cross-platform is a real shame for a lot of games out there would love to see Sony to listen to gamers, they are ussually on point.
---

Shame his reaction didn't include a boat documentary.
---
They also said d1 was a ten year plan...
---
They were playing to unlock new content and get world first, its not the same, they didnt just drive a car for 30 hours just to drive a car
---
Antiope because it has amazing range
---
See, normally, I think this is where people would wear down and just say, screw this, and whatever this guy is on about....BUT....
---
I really didn‚Äôt go off topic with my original response to you.  Streamers that I viewed, were in fact, getting upset with their chats over puzzle solution suggestions. I did, in fact, make a snarky comment insinuating people in chat are most likely subscribers and donators. I also inferred my opinion that these are probably not the people the streamers should be bashing on when they are essentially supporting the streamer. 
---
Eventually, our coupled responses, have indeed, gone astray from OP‚Äôs topic.  However, stating fact and/or opinions does not equate to ignorance or even falsehood. Now, if you‚Äôre unhappy with the aggressiveness of my original post..., maybe I can see that I could have said it differently, but you don‚Äôt strike me as the type that has as thin of skin as that would imply. 
---
Agreeing to disagree is really the way an equal discussion works. If you want to be rude and keep turning my original opinion into something it‚Äôs not..., that appears to be the same thing you were originally stating your disapproval of; trolling. 
---
This has been fun. Stuff like this keeps me sharp for my job. 
---
Yeah. Sony insiders have said that the only reason they don‚Äôt is money. They‚Äôre afraid they might take a slight hit to profit. Which even if they did in the front end, it‚Äôd be more profitable in the long run. Which is ultimately why they caved to the fortnite fan base. We don‚Äôt have near the people to make them listen to us. Lol
---
I dont mind eververse. I got everything I wanted with Just playing the game. Gives me more reasons to keep playing.
---
I would rather suggest they keep eververse, so that they are able to increase their budget and be able to maintain their independence 
---
For some reason, I find it hard to feel sorry for Activision. ü§î
---
Yeap, I would. I farmed this guy for my Malfeasance quest :))
---
I fuckin love this game
---
Nah I get you. And honestly, the more I think, the more I believe there needs to be a best of both worlds thing going on. 
---
I believe the state we are in now with some key differences would be the best if we're talking about a D3 coming out. Keep it like this, implement a few features for casuals but still keep the difficulty where it is or maybe jack it up ( looking at you Scourge). 
---
Raid matchmaking? Sure, go ahead. Maybe make it to where those players are of a certain light though. Maybe even higher than recommended to accommodate for damage and all that. 
---
Lock up guns, armor, and cosmetics for those who do endgame and grind the fuck outta the game? That needs to be done too. Things like Not Forgotten and I guess even Mountaintop (blegh) should be done even more imo with maybe not just one gun per each activity per season. 
---
Exotics need to good or atleast fun to use in for a meaningful chase? That too man, something like Hard Light, while somewhat of a cool idea, pales in comparison to the new Izanami sniper or the Jotun fusion. 
---
I'm probably going on more than wanted but you get my point. 
---
If your point is simply accessibility and not that it needs to become easier then, my friend, I'm on your side.
---
I think we both want similar things honestly. The player base to stay and increase, and Bungie not fucking up. Both things completely in the realm of possibility. Both also in the realm of failing. Just, your perspective comes from a more casual perspective where mine comes from more of a grindy, hardcore perspective. 
---
Did Activision force them to make the eververse?
---
If not, it's still a shit developer.
---
A Chinese dev just put a large amount of money in bungie. Micro transactions aren‚Äôt going anywhere, if anything they might be increasing. 
---
Our Clan was just joking about this the other day. Glad to see other Guardians in the DFW area.
---
Question, do you have a helmet? 
---
Side question, does the helmet stay on?
---
Agreeing is for opinions. This is about whats true and false. Of course people are going to get annoyed when the same debunked or nonsensical suggestion is spammed for 5 hours straight
---
I don't mind pushing deadlines one bit, as long as it's within a reasonable amount of time.  I don't mind the season long metas in the crucible, I don't mind waiting even a whole year for a new expansion like we did with rise of iron, and even for D2 after that.  I'll make the wait, I just want a good game with decent content.  I want Titan to utilize that entire section of the map that we only ever go through for Savathun's song anymore, it's pretty obvious that Bungie intended to do more with that but ran out of time.  I want more weapon and perk variety, I want more mods, I want armor expanded on, I want more.  And that takes time to do and to get right.  So let them have time, I'd rather have properly done content than half-baked content that they couldn't properly finish before Activision tells them to wrap it up.  I'd rather have the wait.
---
Big business practices ruining fun for gamers everywhere.

I hope this means good things for the future of the game we love.

I don't mind micro- transactions unless its pay to win which Destiny 2 is not
---
Seems more like Bungie learned from Blizzard as they get the same Chinese investor Netease now. 
---
I mean true - but even then they try to appeal to both crowds with her rotating weekly inventory.
---
You can see what you're getting there and even get the time to grind for something before something new rotates in.
---
Sure it might take a while before the item you want come round again but that + the RNG of the engrams is.. kinds fine enough. We maybe don;t want to make it too simple?
---
I killed 29 guardians once and got no hate mail
---
Does it drop as a random drop like an exotic from an add or do you get it as a random drop from a frame?
---
Rampaaaaage!!!!!
---
200K nightfall?! it should be 300K+
---
They can‚Äôt just kick them out. They‚Äôre a subsidiary of Acti-Blizzard. So they‚Äôd have to be bought. I don‚Äôt know if Tencent or Netease would be such a great alternative as they‚Äôre highly into mobile gaming.
---
Someone's done a video on it (sorry I can't link it right now, I'll get it later if possible) and they found that whilst Izanagi's burden has higher single shot damage (with/without Honed Edge iirc) the Whisper out-DPS'd it. 
---
Fair point, I forgot she had a rotating inventory as well so that kind of negates my previous comment. I guess the current implementation is probably one of the better ones when you look at it like this... Everything is obtainable by playing and earning the bright engrams, if you're patient enough you'll be able to buy it with money when it comes around in her inventory, or if you're impatient roll the dice and take the chance on buying bright engrams. I actually see nothing wrong with the current setup actually...
---
I see - understandable for sure, but it sounds a little weird. For me, every "powerful gear" drop is a boost in level. It actually sounds like a bug to me. 
---
I have a couple friends that play not that often complaining about getting "left behind" , and I always tell them to relax and just play the game. You will get there eventually - apart from Forges, Iron Banner and the raid, powerlevel is not super important to me. 
---
And its initial version was fine. Since then Activision games (main COD) have gotten very agressive with MTX. D2 comes out and BOOM its the entire end game. Big surprise. Not to mention it follows the system of another Activision owned game named Overwatch. Each time you level up you get a loot box.
---
As soon as I saw the announcement I cam straight here for the memes.
---
I loooove 2nd breakfast almost as much as 1st dinner 
---
Thx for writing that, good to know that holding out to see what's in store for the future, yet wanting to still support the game has paid off and now I can also see if the new expansions seem cool from feedback among the community. 
---
Also food to know the timelocked repetitive parts of D2 are what seemed to be pushed by Activision. 
---
Well there are strikes and heroic missions. All strikes on mars are just story missions..
---
Sure that'd be great!  I thought leviathan took a lot longer than an hour 
---
A rare bounty 
---
We don't know yet. Hopefully Bungie will have more freedom to produce good content and they won't have anyone else to blame for the bad decisions they make (like Eververse, Curse of Osiris dlc, etc.)
---
Get out 
---
Just kidding, wish I had this luck
---
Malfeasance is an easy quest. Can do in an afternoon 
---
Eververse was added because new content was hard. 
---
Ive always wanted to solo the strike playlist
---
But I've *been* to the Pointless Forest, and not only that, but it's not pointless at all! 
---
We know now
---
Shit RNG to huh?
---
I have the same, shame it's pretty awful
---
Afaik its just daily and weekly ba bounty turn ins
---
Well I didn't pay for anything, but yeah you're right. I mixed up the season pass with that
---
Don't, you will just lose it and won't get anything 
---
Yeah, 22 completions of izunami and not one yet. 
---
People seem to think this massive publishing company that is admittedly super focused on profit over game quality have been holding Bungie back from doing some awesome stuff with the Destiny franchise.
---
How/why they dropped contract 2 years early is anyone's guess. Did Bungie save all their pennies and buy out their contract? Renegotiate on some technical contract detail that wasn't being met? Or did they just get dropped by Activision because the game wasn't going to bring in the profits that were expected?
---
Activision.
---
Yourbabygon
---
Yeah yeah...COD's technically their baby....for the sake of memes we must sometimes adjust the truth.
---
It will get ‚Äúworse‚Äù. I don‚Äôt mean worse in a bad way necessarily, but Bungie is gonna need money more than ever to maintain Destiny. 
---
I hate the boopage
---
I got the ikelos shotty from my first EP clear, 1k on my first LW clear and jotunn on my first powerful frame last night. Just saying. :D
---
‚ÄúDownvote all you want‚Äù means if questioned this author won‚Äôt bother to post so pointing out they are whining to whine and sound cool is pointless. 
---
Awesome, thank you!
---
This is definitely my favorite lost sector 
---
Here‚Äôs an article from 2016 about all the people who left. List has obviously gotten longer since.
---
https://kotaku.com/a-ton-of-destiny-devs-have-left-bungie-recently-to-make-1784402854/amp
---
I'd be more willing if the armor was a universal ornament for 1k silver or something
---
theres no such thing as bonus free content, it's all been budgeted and paid for. thats a PR trick to fool idiots.
---
I'm guessing this will change absolutely nothing and everyone is getting all excited over nothing
---
Ah yes, the classic Valve move.
---
That other team was so trash lmao look at all their motes lost.
---
Most of them already got new jobs at other places. I doubt they‚Äôre going to drop their new gig and come running back to the game at this point.
---
Master work armor = waste just my opinion though
---
Thats not what indie studios are.
---
Indie studios are small, basically start ups bungie hasnt been an indie studio in a looooong time 
---
Why do people think publishers are whip cracking slavedrivers that force microtransaction and lootboxes?  
---
Franchise bot d1
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good idea. They‚Äôve shown that they have no clue how to appeal to anyone &amp; changing the core of the game is probably the worst move they can make right now. Destiny is not a MMO in any way so they‚Äôd need to basically do away with the entire structure of Destiny. This will turn so much of the playerbase off. Not everyone of course, but if they try to make it a MMO, Destiny won‚Äôt be Destiny anymore. 
---
The biggest red flag will be if they have to restart.  
---
If you need it do bounties for spider it‚Äôs first drop is tied to his bounties and it will drop after turning a bunch In
---
I don't see a weapon drop there.
---
No, not mental. Emotional. 
---
As you get more of those, you'll see there is a twist there.
---
I might get some numbers wrong since I‚Äôm doing this off memory alone, but to support your point I did a little math. I preordered for $110, bought Forsaken for $40, and then if I did buy the new season pass for $30 I would have spent $180 on a single game. If I had bought the new season pass and spent a grand total of $180, then I could have bought three $60 games with that money (disclaimer: I didn‚Äôt do tax for the games). Tbh I agree with you and think it‚Äôs ridiculous people would have spent around $180 on a SINGLE game, and I will never understand why some people are okay with it.
---
Why is that so important 
---
And now. Jotunn = because i have full pockets of ammo
---
Almost every lead from the studio from Destiny 1 are gone. Lead writer, music, a couple directors. Stories have been that Activision led to a lot of those people exiting. Most notable for me was Marty O‚ÄôDonnell being shown the door after raising hell about Activision using other people‚Äôs music for the ads for the game and stuff.
---
I seem to recall that Activision required them to make a lot of adjustments to the game that conflicted with the artistic vision a good portion of the people wanted.
---
it had to be whisper
---
Maybe not. Now they may not be losing their profits to Activision 
---
We'll come out as soon as dreaming city hits the fourth tier of the curse cycle.
---
The best way to save Destiny 2 would be to remove the garbage like the annual pass, making the base game completely free (but leaving the expansion pass for profits) and start spinning that good will gained from various acts into a promotion for Destiny 3.
---
They absolutely need a new game to truly save the franchise, but it won't get anywhere if they don't earn some good will.
---
I know I was planning on buying the expansion pass, but then I saw the annual pass on top of that and it killed it for me entirely.
---
‚ÄúIn today‚Äôs gaming world regardless of the game people complain if something is handed out, and people complain if something is hard to achieve‚Äù 
---
This is NOT true. Destiny is the only game I‚Äôve ever played where people actually care about how easily other people can get something &amp; having people care about something being too hard. Which is really dismissive when it comes to complaints about the structure of Bungies content btw.  
---
Hopefully no stupid micro transactions in future games
---
Just FYI: The 960 is faster than a 1050 *ti*, so you're not one-upping him with a weaker GPU.
---
I play lots of games and I really enjoy FFXIV but circumstances are causing me to put it off
---
Nope me too just meant it as a possibility i highly doubt it too and dont think it would be worth it if you read blood swest and pixels from an ex owner marty you see its not all black and white at all
---
25 for me.  No 1k. Maybe this weekend....
---
Since Activision is one of those publishers that will nickel and dime a game to death most players see it as Bungie being able to make Destiny into what they always wanted 
---
Deadlines, but also microtransactions.
---
Reminder that in the shareholder conference, they literally talked about new ways to monetize Destiny 2.
---
Yeah right... cuz Bungie doesn't like money or something.
---
Because they are the mist likely to force anything debatable on a product to increase their revenue. It‚Äòs not a given but better err on the safer bet. 
---
Change 200k NF to 300k
---
kindled orchid, better range
---
Not just that but also the incentivisation model of trying to make people log in daily which seems to have led to the new grind model in black armoury. 
---
The Activision Senior Management team talked about it at some length in their shareholder meetings and the benefits of player engagement to new sales and micro transactions. This is what led to the base game becoming free.
---
That's just an assumption. Last year Bungie received a 100 million investment from NetEase, I think they have the finances for this without increasing the microtransactions. 
---
Imo we should just be able to buy anything from Eververse whenever we want, much like the store in Warframe.
---
One with outlaw for sure 
---
I'm not too sure tbh but I posted last night looking for a clan and I was unfortunate enough to join one with racists lol
---
Yeah I see the fireteam tab and all that, but I guess I'm confused of where to start with a raid or the uh nightfall stuff I guess. I've played pretty much everything solo or doing the vanguard strikes that auto match haha
---
Well instead of going off of estimates I looked up the numbers for you. There were 32k people watching Destiny 2 streams on Tuesday &amp; it peaked at 40k on Wednesday &amp; dropped back down to 11k on Thursday. So it‚Äôs not even remotely close to what you thought. There may have been 60k people total if we‚Äôre being extremely generous considering a lot of those viewers &amp; commenters in raidsecrets were probably the same people. 
---
People wanted the forge on Day 1 for 3 simple reasons. They paid for it, they were expecting to be able to play it &amp; the thought of their progress being halted because other people had to solve this puzzle first was dumb, especially once it hit 20+ hours. People with responsibilities don‚Äôt have time to wait around for crap like that, &amp; when you‚Äôre talking about a product that was paid for, all that‚Äôs going to do is agitate those people that wanted to just play the game.
---
I can agree that the AoS quest shouldn‚Äôt have been changed, but Pinnacle weapons not being account based is dumb. I was forced to play my Hunter for 2 weeks to get Redrix &amp; Luna‚Äôs because I started the quest on her. I wasn‚Äôt happy about that. 
---
&amp; no. Hard core players don‚Äôt keep a game afloat. All hard core players do is invest large amounts of time &amp; are guaranteed DLC purchases. Casuals are the ones that spend the most money on games. This is why micro transactions are so popular. A hard core player is going to earn things, while a casual is going to pay because they aren‚Äôt going to be investing a lot of time. Fighting games are the most hard core games there are, &amp; there‚Äôs a reason an overwhelming majority of them don‚Äôt last long. They‚Äôre hard to be good at. When your game isn‚Äôt accessible, casuals leave. Casuals don‚Äôt just leave because they‚Äôre casual. 
---
I give it 6 months before EA buys Bungie.
---
thats what i was thinking just i have so much time in the other one
---
Before he started dating me, be hadn't played a video game in over 4 years. Between med school, his father passing from cancer, and a toxic relationship with his ex, he forgot how much he loved playing games. I showed him the light, and now he can play however long he wants, whenever he wants. I even got him a 4k 65" TV for his birthday to do so. üòâ Huge plus for me too, because I can ask him to help me with jumping puzzles now, because I can no scope a guardian from across a map, but put me in Scourge and ask me to jump from the pipes to get to the maze and its over. Lol
---
I think I‚Äôll pass as my $150 for the game thus far should be sufficient. Giving off the wrong idea about cash shops and game currency. I‚Äôd just sooner not support it. They‚Äôve got enough of my money. 
---
Outlaw rampage one, but would have but would have put rampage spec on that one 
---
I was literally comparing the community to this scene yesterday whilst talking to my friends lmao
---
I don't see Tess ever going away, however I could see them drastically changing Eververse and how we buy and receive content.
---
Bungie are no longer tied to the 10 year deal, as such are free to explore different ways of delivering content and different ways in which we pay for the game. What if annual pass content was free throughout the year, with Forsaken size dlc once per year?
---
First trigger pull I was like what the fuck paused and opened the screen to see if I had read it wrong, it still said shotgun lol. 
---
Show her the shiny pink shaders. I got my female friend into it originally from the dawn and dusk shader and now shes obsessed. Lol
---
i still have plenty of rampage spec so thats what i will most likely do. i just got that one yesterday and the other i have had since it came out
---
Awesome!
---
[deleted]
---
Yup. People just expect everything to be free and easy to get.
---
Eververse was fine. It was chance but you got resources that could be use to buy an item you wanted when it showed ul.
---
I would be more inclined to buy things with the removal of predatory pricing models. If the store was always open win everything available, it would definitely be awesome. I know that the research and results show that the gambling aspects brings in the most money from the whales, but it would be great if it was a more open store without gambling. 
---
Lmao I have almost the exact same load out I have a blast furnace ikelos sg and a bad omens
---
As far as I've done 3 powerful frames in the bergusia forge I haven't had any soo...
---
Wow, unexpected Glee üòÇ
---
Wasn't this mission on the tangled shore though?
---
Or am i failing to remember this
---
So when did dragonfly became a nuke?
---
Foot...? Is that you? Please foot, he needs to know why you hide under such fluffy, warm, fox blankets. FOOT! TELL HIM IT'S YOU! 
---
Yes. It is. 
---
Guess I got extremely lucky than as I got one from all 6 of mine 
---
The change to random perks on armor is the only aspect that has any sort of pay to win (which is typically the stigma associated with any microtransaction system), but there are better perks to be found on end game gear (particularly the enhanced variants). 
---
Or I have awful rng, either way.
---
It was on the ground with the other loot
---
I dont know of any apps. Please recomend one for me if you know of one. On pc. Im a hard core grinder and loved this game for just this, but after I started playing and leveling the Titan it gone completly radit silent. Dont know if this is any indication on how much i have played but i reset my crucible infamy 7 times this season.
---
One key thing, i have not unlocked the dreaming city on my Titan since im 650 on all chars and fuck if doing 3 ascendes challanges aweek.
---
Last wish is my favorite raid. Teaching new people queens walk is the real challenge. 
---
Riskrunner + Devour + Either the melee damage gloves or the vampiric embrace gloves.  I don't care for crucible on Warlock so much, but Gambit is crazy fun.  I've reset once already and about halfway through again and not sick of it at all.
---
Okay obi wan
---
This is definitely NOT fake news! 
---
I actually wished it was a bet they had "solve it within 24 hours or we get back everything " an all or nothing bet and Bungie won LOL. 
---
DiScOrD lol.
---
"I had an engram that everyone can be equal Guardians!"
---
I'm just a simple man trying to make my way in the universe.
---
thought about getting the annual pass but then i saw the black armory prompt that said it entered session 3 or something and it will end in a few weeks. 
---
Why would i pay for the annual pass when part of the content i cant experience because it was behind a time wall.
---
I was more than happy to give them 34.99 until i saw that.
---
You know what? Jar Jar is an excellent way to represent Reddit as a whole. Not even mad. 
---
I have a drop mag/surrounded/rampage added a rampage spec works great.., Great roll, still haven‚Äôt seen even wo drop mag the rampage/kill clip... Bungie wants me to grind!!
---
So.... i left playing destiny months ago, but from what i‚Äôm hearing going around, Bungie left Activision and people are celebrating, right?
---
literally JUST watched this episode last night, might've been the last one before I went to bed haha
---
Nothing will happen to D2, but D3 will most likely still be on the Blizzard launcher as Netease just invested 100 million into Bungie. As they run WoW and Diablo in China, one would assume any future content will stay there.
---
VoG is still the best raid don't @ me
---
Bungie must have something up their sleeve that either Activision didnt know about OR didn't support.
---
Their is far to much swagger from a studio that knows their game is in a risky spot and no longer have a scape goat
---
They absolutely will as people will jump ship on them. If there competitors started doing it with a game that is mostly their community there will be outrage. Exactly like what happened with Fortnite but this time it'll be their own community calling for blood
---
Thank you, great advice. Did you make the guide? Dude that info is awesome.  OK now I understand.
---
Yes
---
Got mine last night off my second characters first powerful frame.  It's so fun to use in crucible...enemies aren't sure what just hit them and then poof there gone.
---
There's a chance the Dreaming City is a source or gives a chance of exotics. I'm trying to cast my mind. I rarely have got exotics from Daily Powerful sources but feel like Weekly Bounties in Tower and Dreaming City seem more productive.
---
There's time wasted on destiny .com or something like that. Character wise I think bungie website tells you time spent on each Character. Or something like light.gg
---
only problem I've really had was paid stuff being too expensive. See: Dark Horse was $20 AUD roughly. Ornaments are also super pricy. A few dollars is fine ($2-3) but it's too high in general imo.
---
I'm not certain, but I'm guessing it's similar to Thunderlord or others where once it's unlocked you can just pull it from collections on your other characters. You probably could still do the quest on multiple characters if you just felt like it. I haven't completed it to know for sure, but I'm betting it's the same as other quest exotics.
---
So to maximize the benefits I should wait till close to 650LL?
---
Ok now I want that. Good clip! 
---
it‚Äôs a bug bungie is aware of. they addressed in a tweet on the bungie help twitter.
---
Yeah and Im the smartass. Sure. Again, your fake "empathy" is not shielding your obvious attempt to troll.
---
Right, because the problem was Activision...

Yes. Bungie has left their 10 year publishing deal with Activision 2 years early, whether that is because Activision booted them or Bungie pulled out we don't know, but Bungie took full publishing rights back for the Destiny franchise in the process. D3 more than likely will not be in the Blizzard launcher because of it, and more than likely delayed a bunch as the make the game the way they want. I suspect D2 is basically final at this point and I think they will keep to the road map they have now for it.
---
Bungie have always had 100% creative freedom. Its not like Activision are the only company in the world who likes money lol. 
---
what helmet is that?
---
the real problem is that it¬¥s befor the quest step for the shattered throne
---
There are two chests for those that don‚Äôt know. However it‚Äôs only accessible by Warlocks and Titans. Hunters don‚Äôt have the required mobility. 
---
The second is across the big gap behind the Morgeth Wish Spawn point. 
---
Lmfao the zoom in
---
The difference between Osiris and Forsaken is huge, I'd definitely recommend it.
---
I would like it to end, but honestly at this point, you seem to be nothing more than a school yard bully. I was honestly going to respond with a lighthearted, yet snarky, "clap". 
---
But since you keep evading the obvious, and I'm now at a desktop, here you go:
---
&gt;I also inferred my opinion that these are probably not the people the streamers should be bashing on when they are essentially supporting the streamer.
---
&gt;Regardless, my opinion is that a business entity should not place their frustration on customers.
---
&gt;Third time now.
---
No.
---
Opinion; A business entity should not take their frustration out on their paying customers.
---
So, add this up, carry the one, dot the i......, that's four times now.
---
This is what i dream destiny will become the never ending fos open world that i can play for a decade 
---
Bethesda is a publisher 
---
Like the others have said, there is no fast way. You just have to do [all the powerful gear activities](https://old.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/9epi7c/im_not_sure_some_of_you_appreciate_just_how_many/) each week (list no longer 100% complete) each week. Prime engrams (powerful gear random drops) drop after a set number of kills, so be sure to kill things too, not just run past them. 
---
Activision is business centered around profits, much like every other business out there. This puts tight deadlines, possibly poor staffing and management decisions around "Profiting" which is not a bad business practice.
---
Bungie is/should be the same in that aspect. However, if they're their own boss, they decide their own budget limit. Their ideas are their own, and they can act on it without being bottlenecked by Activision's poor management decisions.
---
Pros:
---
* Better game direction focused around playerbase feedback
---
* No pressure to meet "Activision's Sale Expectations."
---
* Possibly future content with actual content rather than $20 for dull shit. Only time will tell.
---
* Bungie would reap 100% of the profits, rather than Activision eating the majority of it. With full financial gain, it could lead to better/bigger game content.
---
Cons:
---
* Not as much marketing value that Activision can offer. This can lead to a lower playerbase.
---
* Lowered financial backing, which could ruin future game development if Bungie can't afford to bring their ideas to life.
---
Of course all this is speculation and theory. It makes sense based on business perspective, but we'll have to see.
---
[**NICE YOU STOLE IT FROM THE ORIGINAL POST**](https://twitter.com/DeRoeckstar/status/1083339523273252864)

That opinion was well past the point of the initial, shall I say clash.
---
Steam
---
Thank you! I agree the newcomers would be a little confused, but if Bungie were to actually do a reboot, I feel this would be the only way. With proper implementation of archived grimoire in game, players who are confused, could potentially 'catch-up' so they wouldn't be so lost. Plus, reliving the entire story in a different way and altering the timeline would essentially make the overwritten past moot. It's theoretically a whole new story for all players to enjoy and move forward in!
---
You did good. Thats all. Keep Fighting with that Lion Guardian! (I think its a glitch btw)
---
Fuck the tower just give us the old raids back.
---
Oh and bungie incase you read this, I'm willing to pay for it.... 
---
Got the same shader on my kindled orchid too. Love it
---
[removed]
---
I did the same shit last night! Jumping a gap with my super going and went for the slam. Missed the ledge and just shot straight to my death. Got a good laugh.
---
They complain because it exists, because some*one* out there spends hundreds of dollars on silver until they get *exactly* what they want. Thus feeding the MTX machine. It encourages developers to put them in their games. I mean even fucking Halo has them now.
---
I'd love to try out the Raids...if I had anyone to play them with...
---
So.. new Nazca lines? I imagine that would take awhile. Which desert did you do this in then? Can it be seen from space? Nice work anyways.
---
Almost wish this was Po from Kung Fu Panda opening the dragon scroll. 
---
yes best meme 
---
You get 3 per character each week just in the process of doing your weekly milestones. Then you also get a free matrix activation for something else you don't have. That's way more and way faster than what something like overwatch hands out.
---
It wouldn't work for a lot of other reasons as well. This could easily be fixed by either the collections or simply following suit with games like WoW where armor and weapons become obsolete after major expansions. 
---
The biggest issue is the need to engineer a way for all of it to plug together and play as one game, as well as needing to spend the manpower on porting the game to PC (otherwise it would singlehandedly kill the PC playerbase). 
---
It's never to late to change the path you're going down, boys
---
Microtransactions aren't inherently evil.
---
On the contrary, they're a downright brilliant way for Dev's to continue making money on people willing to spend while not forcing those costs down the throats of every single player.
---
Have you noticed how video game prices have hardly increased in the last 20 years?
---
Back in the day AAA titles used to cost pretty much what they do now. That doesn't sound important but when you factor in inflation over those two decades... dev's had to find some way to keep monetizing their games without just charging 100 bucks for them, you know?
---
Nice work OP
---
Lol
---
Where are the Nova Warp warlocks with their Telestos?
---
Dude I also need Coke...

Thanks

ü¶ÄActivisiom is dead!ü¶û

You probably tethered twice and had orpheus to get ur super back with the orbs still on the ground. then catalyst Fighting Lion makes more orbs with the multikills.
---
Wait poe is in d2??
---
Y'all know the difference between a partnership with a studio, and owning a studio right ?
---
Activision letting Treyharch go basically means closing them off.
---
Not sure how parting with Activision will save Destiny. Sure it is a good thing, but I have little confidence in Bungie these days. Many problems like reskinned content, and lack luster story telling has been complete crap and over priced. 
---
I am skeptical that this divorce will result in any real improvement of the state of Destiny. The opening scene of Destiny was that the arrival of the traveler meant that our Destiny was to walk in the light of other stars. 5 years later and we haven‚Äôt even left the solar system. 
---
ü¶ÄActivision is dead!ü¶Ä
---
Lol dang spell check 
---
There is nothing in this game that requires you to have three characters. No other quest has worked like this one before, so I am inclined to think it only being doable on one character is not intentional. 
---
Rare bounties can drop from Ada-1's bounties, and there are people who say they are *very* rare drops from forges. Never been able to get a clear answer about whether you can just do the forge, or if you have to be forging a weapon. 
---
Haha, good luck finding you're cloke mate. 
---
Welll, sometimes, your fighting lion gets really excited....
---
Is there any reason why DO couldn't be this game?

Definitely in super willing to wait for good content. Take your time and do it right, don't cut things for saving time, but you know actually work on it at the same time. Like I've said there's a difference between taking your time and being lazy and they slipped from taking time to being lazy in the past which is super why I'm scared.
---
No, I do not have a source disputing something that never happened.
---
Oh man its not easy of fun lol
---
I've spent over $1000 on planetside 2 where you could buy the exact item you wanted vs $0 in overwatch where practically everything is a gamble.
---
I got lucky with a helmet like that, and then I got gloves that have machine gun loader and machine gun scavenger. It's crazy fun with Thunderlord or even Hammerhead!
---
Got my wife the same way. Not sure it was a win. A new Xbox and tv later... she occasionally needs a carry.
---
Okay initially I had typed "fuck no" because these companies don't need any more motivation for money grabs. 
---
However if it went to subscription-based they would need a staff and a content schedule similar to what WoW does and that takes an army of staff and some excellent content designers, writers and a well thought out release schedule. 
---
I think Destiny has other things to workout before making that kind of leap.
---
Hey thanks a lot dude
---
Here's the picture if you're curious [https://imgur.com/a/5kwJBMS](https://imgur.com/a/5kwJBMS)

My last game last night was I think 92 notes banked, almost 100 enemies, and like 4 guardians defeated. Was the best match I ever had, so good work!
---
No &amp; then some more no &amp; then no again
---
Cool, just clarifying. If there's an increase in content that correlates, yea I'd do a subscription. But I'm not doing a month to month thing, only if yearly is an option and better yet if you can prepay like xbox live and other services. I've got too many month-to-month stuff to worry about billing.
---
By all means, link me to proof that they've supposedly bought '5 studios'. 
---
Noice, don't have anarchy but, black talon can melt a strike boss.
---
I‚Äôd love to but I don‚Äôt have monarch. Friend of mine does so I could do that on his account. Honestly I really loved the QuickDraw zen moment thin line. Thing is nuts 
---
Any chance microtransactions will be removed in Destiny 2 now?
---
Everyone probably had queens breaker or sleeper and all used at once
---
If only we could transmit... kinda like how we transmit crap all over the universe all the time but get radiant seeds and we find out Ava-1 doesn‚Äôt have transmit capabilities. I assume she also still uses a fax machine and beeper.
---
Once something, even true, is on CNN, it becomes fake news.
---
This, plus slowly integrating D1 raids and such, could be freaking awesome.
---
Merciless again!? 
---
They are indeed, but the external shape looks like an hexagon.
---
Amazing combo, plus it solves the recoil problem that those HC have. I've got year 2 better devils with outlaw zen moment that I love.
---
It IS possible to run interference without killing. Any time they spend looking for you is time away from farming motes. Actually, it's possible to be an even bigger help to run interference the whole time than to score kills for a brief period of time.
---
Fair points, it seems that this would not be a viable path for Bungie to take moving forward (providing that poll trends continue to massively favor "no").
---
It's pretty much a looter shooter like borderlands. If I remember the beginning has a few unsavory moments (like making you WALK around after the city collapses.)
---
But the campaign is decent and once you get into leveling and getting better and better gear then you can decide. Co-op missions, events, and of course raids are fun.
---
Except BUNGIE is the entire reason for Tess, not Activision.
---
I‚Äôll definitely have to give it a go. I spent a full day playing rumble with double Bows (won three matches in a row lol) hoping that would make trinity ghoul drop. Still hasn‚Äôt happened. I want it so badly 
---
Nothing, the game will still get full Blizzard support 
---
Dude super hope you get ghoul it's a great bow. Praying to the rnjesus for you.
---
Woah chill out dude, sorry I work and didn‚Äôt search BRO. 
---
Agreed.
---
Hey thanks for the reply.
---
You're right about that quote, sorry. The Queen directs us to the Black Garden, but that quote is from Miss Bray on Venus.
---
To add onto all of this, look at the thing behind the Drifter on the ship. It looks very similar to the Black Heart but with updated graphics. Albeit less vacuous and sharper. I am desperate to know wtf he has caged on that ship!
---
One things clear, we're starting to get a clear idea of how the Darkness works. Multiple sources are painting a clearer picture.
---
How will this work exactly? Is Bungie going to put D2 on life support and focus on making D3 or are they going to keep adding new content to D2 making money for Activision?
---
Love how his body is still falling in the background on the second revive.
---
This
---
I have literally never related to anything this much in my entire fucking life
---
As the dedicated team invader I get that, it's still scary to see 3 kills all game (not possible to dunk 130 motes in a single round from all team members
---
In this game it worked, but the other teams invader had a field day (14 kills is pretty good, between 4 to 5 a round) 
---
Hahaha thank you but I‚Äôm considering summoning RMGsatan to kick RNGesus‚Äô ass to get back at him for all the loot I‚Äôve not gotten 
---
Not me, man.  I could listen to Claudia Black all day.  I wish she'd just recite a list of all my failings.
---
I'm exactly the same. It's hard to visualize how all the mechanics are gonna play out without doing it. And often sherpas tend to explain particular methods for beating it instead of or as well as the mechanics themselves without making clear what's what. Last time we ran Last Wish our clan guide was not very helpful to the three first timers because he kept telling them what to do, rather than how it works. 
---
A well regarded gaming reporter with no source.
---
Oh the irony of that statement. 
---
I actually made a reddit account just to upvote this.
---
inb4 EA buys up Bungie and we're back to where we were, but we're pandering to SJWs on the side.
---
Jesus Christ, it‚Äôs Jason Bourne! 
---
One can be found at gas station, the other one can be found at the bum on the street. Pick your poison :D
---
What gun is that??
---
Same, I don‚Äôt feel like talking to others aswell, especially since English isn‚Äôt my first language I feel weird about it 
---
I disagree. Activision are the ones who called Forsaken(which was a player focused expansion that addressed a TON of the issues with the game that were present before)a disappointment and that they wanted to pursue further forms of monetization, while Bungie said they loved it and that they wanted to continue in that player focused direction. You can pretty obviously tell where the Activision and Bungie arguments occurred(such as last years Dawning, for example, which was a total joke)and where Bungie said ‚Äúfuck it, don‚Äôt want to argue, just do what they say‚Äù. 
---
I think with Activision gone, Destiny will go back to being the great game it could‚Äôve been. I don‚Äôt give a fuck about deadlines - if they take forever to release new content, at least it‚Äôll be good content that‚Äôs polished and worth my time. 
---
Hey! For PvP I use the MIDA combo. I mostly use MIDA multi tool, though. I have the gunslinger subclass, more specifically, way of the thousand cuts.  
---
P O D R A C I N G 
---
Yeah, about that catalyst...
---
It still does, you've just minimized the bar.
---
How fast did you get to 650 with the annual pass?
---
Casual means you play for a few hours a week and go off and play other games. Grind out a few milestones maybe cheese a raid or 2. Then play something else. "Hardcore" gamers are people who stream mainly one game and complete all the tasks available at the time they are announced or available. Casuals couldn't grind up to 650. Everyone below 600 got double prime drops upwards of 8 to 9 lvls higher while everyone at cap had to struggle up. Forges were too hard at launch? Lower lvl reqs. Now their too easy no one wants to do them. Raid? Great mechanics. People cheese every aspect and try to call it "speed strats". Finally a challenging puzzle that cant be beat in a day even by the "best of the best" everyone whine and complain so that all the work the "hardcore" gamers put into trying to complete it is now a waste of their time. Casual mentality has ruined this game for those of us that truely enjoy it. 
---
Go take a nap dude. 
---
Heh. I'm okay, Guardian. I'm just a grumpy, cynical, 40+ year old Cajun nerd.
---
Oh
---
What most people do is clear the Bank Area of all the adds to allow the Primeval Slayer x(?) buff to ramp up to 4 or 5 and then they'll ult it and kill it in less than 5 seconds.
---
I don't think any Super is worth using outside of Primeval phase EVER in Gambit, unless you're using Golden Gun Hunter/Sentinel Titan to invade and drop motes.
---
The reason people wait for the Primeval Slayer buff to stack and melt, as opposed to whittling the Primeval down before the buff stacks is, well, one decent invade from the enemy with a Queensbreaker or something can nullify all that Power/Special ammo relatively easily.  It's much, much safer to clear adds, and play safe, waiting for the invade to come through and kill the invader, and THEN kill the Primeval.
---
Well of Radiance + Shadowshot Tether = Dead Primeval with Primeval Slayer x4 in under 5 seconds typically.
---
What are motes?
---
It‚Äôs basically the fanatic and everything it lives for
---
OK. I will try, but it is kinda hard when opponents are constantly moving. 
---
No offence, but I asked on how to get better at what you said.
---
Is true, people need to know this more. 
---
Actually it doesn‚Äôt, lmao. I can‚Äôt even click on the bar
---
If it was a Gofannon Forge then they are grinding the Lore. It's unfortunate but when lore is that rare (completed 27 forges only received 2) then that's what happens. Although if that is what was going on then that player truly was a jerk because you are supposed to change your PC or Consoles time/year to que in alone.    
---
how many of the forges have you completed on that character?
---
Agreed. Hopefully they also don‚Äôt release it at a poor time like they did with 2. Think there would‚Äôve been a way bigger fan base
---
Ok. I will try.
---
Then i misunderstand you. If bungie says "sorry yall this puzzle wasnt meant to be this obscure. Here is the solution. Then its no ones fault and we just carry on. If they add a reward, everyone will have it whether someone solves it or they give the solution. Because it doesnt change the fact 99% of players can look up how to do it immediately after its solved. 
---
Any reward, regardless of if a player completes it or bungie gives the answer. Will be obtainable by anyone with an internet connection.
---
Unless, you mean something like the dqy 1 raid jacket or something. Exclusive to the first person(or group) to solve it.
---
Obviously there wouldnt be a need for something like that if they give the solution away. But there also wont be a way if no one can solve the puzzle. Which *could* be the fault of the puzzle makers, or we simply arnt there yet.
---
Either way i can see giving it another week or so. But after that not much reason to keep it undoable.
---
Yeah i feel you on the bounty part. I have yet to get one to drop. Really sucks. 
---
Thought about that but unfortunately my other ALTs are just waiting to unlock izanami üò≠
---
idk lol just making a meme 
---
I made basically the same post as this but with guardian kills and got the same comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/aexlj9/comment/edtn0hr
---
Weird
---
If you're god tier desperate delete a character and power grind up to 50 , if you do decide to do this just make sure you save the armor and guns so it can be right where you had it 
---
Yeah 7th one. I need an upgrade for my leg item but won‚Äôt complain at this instead. 
---
What money?  If they don‚Äôt get a revenue stream quick, they have no support and could fold soon. All the games are bought already. They owe seasons of new content without any new sales to bring in. I hope I‚Äôm wrong, but it feels like Activision cut-bait and this game is on its last leg. 
---
100% agreed
---
Lol so true 
---
I was under the impression that only the first team to solve it got the reward. In that case, putting out the solution would almost certainly remove that reward. That misunderstanding has been cleared up by another user.
---
but, it expires in 13 days. where on here does it say it needs to be shattered throne bounties? 12 dailies and 1 weekly can be done next week before this bounty expires.  
---
I personally like snapshot sights with slideshot because one hit kills are more consistent when ads.
---
Extended magazine is not preferable, and what's the masterwork? If it's range, you're in great luck! If not, that's alright. You still have a decent roll for pvp. :)
---
Completely subjective. The perks on the Wishbringer you posted are something I'd instantly dismantle, but for many it might be a decent PVP roll. Sliding isn't a part of my usual playstyle and slideshot just doesn't appeal to me, but it does to others. 
---
This is how pretty much all rolled items are, just pick what works with your playstyle.
---
I need the shattered throne this week before reset because the next step in the izanagies burden quest is the shattered throne completion
---
It‚Äôs Izanagi‚Äôs Burden. I have Le Monarch, and had the ‚Äúunknown‚Äù there until I unlocked Izanagi‚Äôs last night, and am now 16/16 for ‚Äúkinetic‚Äù exotics.

I just realized that in the forest there are probably an infinite number of caydes we can just go and get...

\-And he might be.  He doesn't remember anything so maybe once he catches up on his wrongdoings maybe he will have an awesome redemption arc?  Guess we'll just have to wait and see! :)

How can‚Äôt with that weapon. Automatic downvote 
---
Those always make the best stories though
---
lol dude... not all the bullshit in D2 is Activision‚Äôs fault. 
---
Bungie has a lot to do with a lot of the garbage that D2 is.

D2 isn‚Äôt suddenly gonna get better... please...

It is a Variant of the existing emblem for that planet. Go to the Io specific emblem and inspect it to see the variants.

be in my shoes.  ive had 4 rare bounties previously and what did i do.....cashed them in and got ba armor, didn't know i would need 1.   got a rare yesterday and have to do 50 forges......HAHAHHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!

This one looks cool too!

Thx

Omg man I'm so sorry I dread this will be Me

Thank you so much

I keep seeing this number in the subreddit but idk what it means. Is it a reference to something? I got the game from the free giveaway if that changes anything.
---
Oh! okay I'll try those. I really appreciate it. I don't really know how to find people so this is a great help.
---
I'm dead inside, friend. 
---
It's hard to say given we don't really know just how divergent Activision made them change it from what they originally wanted. Only time or an explanation from them will tell at this point. I personally hope it Mena great things because, as you even stated, they did excellently with the hall series while it was under their command. Let's hope they can stand well enough alone on their own...and hopefully an end to the timed PS4 exclusives!

just so your aware activision has nothing to do with us not having crossplay, the contract between bungie and activision actually states intent for crossplay in the roadmap
---
nobody can judge uldren right now because he isnt uldren. We dont even know if hes going to stick with his old name either
---
Now kings fall was a pain in the ass.
---
&gt; And prior art is not a certification of soundness or validity. And your example of WoW started with the subscription model - selling expansions for additional charge still seems as silly to me now as it did when it was first released.
---
Except that expansions cost money to create, market, implement and maintain. An expansion is basically a new game with new content, but you can still access the old game and you can keep some of the cosmetics or whatever you've earned.
---
Maybe think of it this way: if you buy a 20XX Ford, do you expect to get a discount on the next year's model? No, absolutely not. Why? Because it's a brand new car that took money to develop, test, manufacture, market, ship, and then sell. Sure, it's got a lot of the same features and framework as your current Ford, and you can drive your current Ford for as long as you like, but if you want the new car you have to pay for it. Or wait and buy it used.
---
Does it really take "sick mental gymnastics" to acknowledge that game development is expensive and it makes sense that you'd pay for something that is new and cost money to develop?
---
&gt;Maybe you're using the word raid differently than dungeon, but if we include dungeon, that is absolutely false. Dungeons got about a 70% nerf after HoT, and to the best of my knowledge they were never buffed back up to their original levels. Well, at least not before I decided the whole endeavor was stupid and I decided to part ways with it.
---
No, I'm not talking about the 10-man raids. And the 5-man fractals, which are some of the most profitable end-game content the game has available. But sure, mourn the loss of dungeons - but it sounds like you threw the baby out with the bathwater. It's not ridiculous for games to adjust the rewards given for activities based on the economy and what features they decide to continue to support. It would be nonsense to have the really high-quality 5-man content in fractals while keeping dungeons the same profitability. 
---
Sounds like you want video games that stay the same but keep adding content for free. I recommend you check out Path of Exile - incredible game, entirely f2p (only money on cosmetics and increasing stash size), all expansions have been free and are top notch quality.
---
&gt;D2 is really just an online version of Borderlands, not really an MMO. There's no persistent world, there's no player market interaction, not really any crafting to speak of.
---
Lmao that actually is a really good comparison for D2, I'll upvote you for that.
