#NEEDLESS TO SAY I SENT THE WHOLE SHIPMENT BACK
---
Refurbished isn't legendary?  I thought all the BA shaders were. 
---
Pikes I can stand, but they‚Äôre still annoying af so I always try to kill them anyway. Then the moment I try to kill them, the drivers suddenly become Terminators and kill me in under a second
---
Ayoooooooo!
---
No refurbished is a rare shader but new age black armoury and the other animated shaders are legendary.
---
Same for the cursed thrall, *technically*, they ‚Äúdie to their death explosion.‚Äù Which would imply that they‚Äôre dying because they choose to I guess
---
At least it has rampage 
---
Ahh where do i find the discord at?
---
He looks a bit more like lvl 99 boss, but that‚Äôs how mafia works I guess
---
This shotgun has decent range unlike my lord of wolves pulse rifle 
---
I got my main one with FF + KC with a stab mod and Steady Rounds. It's range and stab are over 90.
---
nether do i this info seems to be non existent on reddit but was a big deal in warming and was on the official patch notes.
---
I still consider Ophedian aspect to be one of the best exotics in the game for crucible. 
---
I got a lemon about an hour ago. Hammerhead with tap the trigger and mulligan lol. Along with a rocket launcher with no cluster and a grenade launcher üòè still my first forge weapons so idk, more excited to buy black armory mods 
---
That‚Äôs how mafia works 
---
I feel this way but with the sleeper nodes and trying to get the god damn Frigid jackle
---
I‚Äôd be happy with that, my first has a mod on it I want, waiting for another 650 primary to drop now
---
that shot with toby was \*intergal\* to the story
---
He got drunk and dropped the coin he normally flips.
---

---
OP is saying vex milk gets you intoxicated. The drifter had too much of this intoxicating drink, dampening his motor skills so he couldn't perform the task he set out to accomplish. Which was flipping the coin to tell you what's on the field. By dropping the coins things were not alright alright alright. He couldn't make you rich, brother, if he drops the coin. I would assume the next panels of this meme would show him having difficulty picking up the coin to try again.  
---
Nah nah keep those in.. But not snipers or shotties
---
It was weird bc I have a 600 titan and hunter and started a warlock from 0 to 50. When I got to level 50 I transferred my 600 guns event though my armor was week I got insanely powerful drops. Ex: I got 550 boots from 500 and then like a 580 something. I got to 600 light in 1 weekend. Sort if this seems like I‚Äôm flexing but if you start a new character transfer your guns over and I think the game tries to catch you up with your armor 
---
Experience 
---
Wow that's just so funny. 
---
Wife and I are almost 40. We play almost every day. 
---
You got it my guy! 
---
I'd love for this to be in game. He just pulls out a hand cannon and shoots it on the ground and says "looks like a mystery today!" and then you wouldn't know what you're fighting until you hit the field. 
---
Oh shit!
---
How do you milk a Vex?
---
What triumph do you have left? 
---
QueenBreaker kid ü§£
---
Just the "deposit 100 motes in a match without dying" 
---
All memes are shitty these days.
---
You get one second added when you throw a ball at the center. You get 5 seconds for each orange (major) that you kill. Time gained is mostly from killing the dudes that drop the ball.
---
Yeah someone already mentioned it. Too lazy to fix it
---
Imagine trying to get Dredgen LOL
---
Bruh...that don't sound like a quickie.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
That... that sounds long.
---
I know. Case in point : "dangerous for you and your enemy"
---
Tho, I actually don't know how high the DPS of the weapon is. It should be one of the highest, if not the highest with the right conditions as it is the only weapon that can 1-Phase Nokris pretty easily if I remember correctly....
---
He‚Äôs not saying it‚Äôs some crazy hard trick; it‚Äôs fun as hell to cause that much destruction. 
---
GIVE ME THOSE EXOTICS OR ELSE!
---
Imagine there was an exotic emote that let you use your equipped super in the Tower
---
Bugged
---
Thats how mafia works
---
happened for me for both quest. i think it‚Äôs just not hard
---
Happy cake day!
---
I just run around picking up the orbs and then spam 4 lunaboots well of radiance all over the map, cuz harmony is an overpowered buff
---
am I doing this wrong?
---
Goddamn
---
You have to wait until the Public Event Taken Blight starts, then head up to near the entrance to the Lost Sector and a yellow bar boss will spawn - kill it, and then on a little plateau nearby a portal opens to the whisper event. 
---
Or me literally 90% of the time I flip a coin. *Flips, looks at it in the ground* uhhh...  Hive, bring a sword.
---
You‚Äôre probably better off naming what part of the lore it goes against, as there is a ridiculous amount of lore to do with rasputin
---
It‚Äôs from the new raid it‚Äôs similar to the forge shader but it‚Äôs inverted 
---
Lord of the hunt isn't counted as a gold-tier medal on the emblem. The emblem acts the same as the "Made Shaxx Proud" emblem in the regular Crucible and tracks the Iron Banner version of the same medals.
---
The list of medals it tracks are as follow's. Getting any of these medals and claiming the triumph will unlock the emblem. I got the emblem once I claimed the "Ghost Wolf" triumph.
---
#### Iron Banner Gold Medals:
---
#### Iron Legend
---
#### Fifth Horseman
---
#### Ghost Wolf
---
#### Seven Deadly
---
#### One Fell Swoop
---
#### Usurper
---
#### Warlord
---
i swear this post has been done for almost every enemy type now? I've definitely seen a vex, fallen, cabal (psion) and now scorn. just waiting for a sexy taken and a sexy hive XD

&gt; What a piece of shit!

---
I feel like exotics should get a "are you sure, idiot?" dialog box.  I did this recently and I still feel like an idiot.  I meant to be locking it, but dismantled out of habit.
---
&gt; hunters have the best exotics and supers. 
---
Haha. Imagine. 
---
&gt; I want to defeat opponents because I'm better than them, not because I have the better equipment or a gun that aims for me.
---
This is why a "BR only" competitive mode would rule. 
---
Buy a lottery ticket if that‚Äôs a thing in your country! Maybe a few
---
One of my favs. Tex Mechanica is the way to go.  
---
I said in the other comment but mostly that they kinda retconned his location and that we thought each planet had their own warmind.
---
Warlocks can very well not play the supporter role and use supers like the kamehameha one and deal massive damage instead. Or a Rift with lunafaction boots also helps a ton for YOU and your team mates. There is no ability which you can't use on yourself and that's good.
---
There is no true supporter subclass. The well of radiance is the closest thing to it.
---
Raids do demand it a lot though, but no need to do something you don't want to.
---
__________________
---
I like playing defender Titan a lot and the super benefits the whole team anf myself. Even the melee ability gives the team an overshield, so it kind of is a supporter subclass, but not really. Same can be said about the forsaken Banner Shield. Using the blocking ability will create a shield that increased the damage of whoever is shooting through it while being protected from enemy fire. But you can also simply use it for yourself to block any damage.
---
_________________
---
The nightstalker hunter also plays a somewhat supportive role as it has perks that affects all team mates and is good for orb generation. You tether the enemies and make them 50% weaker for everyone.
---
Destiny is not your average MMMORPG where classes or characters decide your roles. Play whatever the fuck you want.
---
I agree.  I always use mine.
---
Decent but there‚Äôs better
---
I'm a casual player if that matters. 
---
It is a beautiful thing.
---
Whisky on the field!
---
Heavy ammo drop goes to invader by priority. You can damage the boss in dozens of ways, super stacking being even better than heavy, but heavy ammo is the most reliable way for an invader to get kills. 
---
Some things I think every player should know:
---
* Completing the main story unlocks some conveniences, such as a vehicle to zoom around on, and being able to turn in stuff to each vendor in exchange for random items. But don't feel like you need to rush if you don't want to. The #1 thing all my friends say they wish they knew is that there is nothing wrong with taking your time. A lot of mechanics are never outright stated, or shown through gameplay, so it is possible to miss them if you charge through on autopilot. 
---
* You can level up really fast by doing [Heroic public events](https://www.polygon.com/destiny-2-guide-walkthrough/2017/9/7/16263480/heroic-public-events-find-trigger-earth-titan-nessus-io) if you complete a secret objective during public events. Leveling up unlocks the other two elemental subclasses. You will eventually get enough upgrade points to unlock everything, and you can swap between each subclass and subclass tree at will. 
---
* When you look at the director and hold E, it should tell you what you are supposed to do next to advance the story. 
---
* When you encounter enemies with shields, use your secondary weapon to break the shield, and if it is the same element as the shield colour, it will do bonus damage and cause an explosion when the shield breaks. 
---
* The maximum level in the base game is 20 and the maximum light level is 300, but after 260-ish you will need to do weekly and daily challenges (basically, any activity that says "powerful gear") in order to reach 300. With all three DLCs the max level is 50 and the max light level is 650, and you need to do challenges to get above 500. This is "the grind." 
---
* This game is around 80% pve content and 20% pvp content. 
---
* Most guides for base game content have not been updated ever, so the terminology and some information about how to progress are outdated. However, guides for DLC content are mostly new enough that this is not a problem.
---
* The in-game chat is always very quiet, but do not confuse this for the game being dead. Most people communicate using Discord and other programs like that. To find people to play with, you can use this subreddit's discord (linked in the top right on desktop) or the /r/destinythegame discord (linked in their sidebar). There is also the official Destiny 2 app, /r/fireteams, /r/destinysherpa for raids (do not worry about this until later), or platform-specific things. 
---
Kingpin is a cabal 
---
No idea. Hopefully it doesn't return one bullet to the mag lol 
---
People will be eventuality be running around in PVP with wet noodles that hit for 1 damage.
---
Guides of Yggdrasil 
---
Tbh I still don‚Äôt know who we are, what we do, or how we were ever formed in the first place. I‚Äôm fairly new as well, played Y1 pre Osiris, came back couple months ago and got invited to it randomly. 
---
It ain‚Äôt much, but it gives you more powerful gear so
---
you aren't doing it fast enough
---
That has nothing to do with my question, thanks.
---
I mean, if I just stop inputting at 1532 it gives me about 3 more seconds, but as soon as I do the same thing and hit 4 it just resets automatically idk
---
Oh man the rabbit hole goes deeper. Thanks! 
---
Man I hate it in gambit, everyone always taking the kill so I have to reload
---
Never delete an exotic.
---
TBF I've gotten way more luck killing people with Blast Furnace from across the map than using my hammerhead or thunderlord. :p
---
Trash. Full autos are bad in pvp, and no goo perks for pve. Would keep for pve only if you dont have other full autos
---
It's a nice gun but breakneck kinda kills it. While breakneck doesn't refill on kill, it has a hidden reload ability and does the faster fire rate thing. #buffhuckleberry 
---
so all these exotics are actual weapons found randomly in the world. okay that actually makes sense
---
Literally nothing to do with destiny?...
---
Cause the weapon is called sleeper simulant,  he was making a joke on the error. 
---
I hate you
---
[removed]
---
I love this gun
---
Also make sure to take an awful pixelated and crooked screen shot with your phone so that you can post it on here. 
---
Then *later on* make a post asking ‚Äúhave the exotic drop rates changed???!???????‚Äù. 
---
To collect? Yes. Is it worth using. Not really. But try it out to see if you like it. 
---
I didn‚Äôt ask for a nerf, I asked if it was going to receive one.  I heard it was.  Reading comprehension is a rarity here apparently.
---
Got it on my second, damn man, is it that rare?
---
Crossing my fingers for you
---
It‚Äôs not very cool but you can say you got it, I had 2 drop at the end of my nightfall and one was masterworked 
---
But no site? It‚Äôs a shotgun haha
---
Sorry, your submission has been automatically removed.

This post type has been made too much and will now automatically be removed.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/destiny2) if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
Not sure that‚Äôs true, or how you know what most players think.  
---
Why would you wanna know? If it's good enough as it is then of course it's not getting a nerf
---
Maybe it's because you're using Crimson that fires the three bullet bursts, and the game didn't know how to deal with it and let you fire the three bullets? 
---
Ever run so with 2 rigs hunters... we lost 3 good men that run üòÇ
---
Oh I see now. I thought he was asking. 
---
Throw your shoe!
---
Because I‚Äôm a returning player and I‚Äôve been wanting it but if it‚Äôs getting a nerf I wouldn‚Äôt want it as much.  Why do I need to explain why I want to know lol. This sub is so toxic lmao I asked a simple question and everyone started pms‚Äôing.

Read your title incorrectly and was like 'it does though' 
---
Oh wow how do you get it? And thanks :D
---
If you shoot it 1,500 times then you'll get a random exotic.
---
That's what I have on my eystein. Not the greatest gun, but those perks are a ton of fun.

Apparently it is Adds as in additional enemies/enemies/whatever term. I looked online and turns out the term has existed for many years in mmos. 
---
I still remember when I got my first forsaken exotic
---
Do I remember my first ever D1 exotic, yes
---
Do I remember my first D2 Y1 exotic, no
---
Curse of Osiris, no
---
Warmind, no
---
Well I guess we'll just have to change that won't we?
---
Images you can hear 
---
Decent roll, Opening shot gives it some aim assist, IMO the best roll is snapshot kill clip, kill clip let's you 1 hit bodies.
---
nope, youtuber/streamer gladd one phased it as a 3 man.
---
Savala needs to fucking die. He's been setting us up for failure our entire existence......what's that there's a god we need to destroy?.......you there guardian. Handle that by yourself. You can only take up to 2 people with you tho. And be prepared to kill about 30x more enemies then there are of you. 
---
Oh your gonna go on a raid guardian. Your limited to 5 people, your not allowed to bring any extra ammo. And your strength will be handicapped. Depending how strong you are. And if your just a little bit weaker than then enemy. Your damage will be significant. Strength guardian. Its what we don't believe in
---
I'm happy your story had a happy ending. On the other hand, he's still a douche, and now you're friends with a douche.
---
Good game, Dude!

Osprey is a nightfall drop brother!

This is a repost, is that actually your girlfriend? ü§î
---
HOLY MOTHER OF GOD! Thank you so much! I'm giving you gold for saving me a fuck ton of time and sanity. As soon as I can figure out how to give gold, haha.
---
Yeah the rng for the schematics suck. I think I went about 45 dupes before getting the final one for me, the scout... basically I think you are lucky if you get schematics with 2 nodes every time, mine took 17 at worst... Keep at it, you'll get it eventually. Just drop in after daily resets and do 1 schematic a day, that was the way I went with it.
---
Sure is
---
All right, all right, all right! Let's see what we've got!
---
Rice farmers! Bring a flamethrower.
---
Suggestion: first pic should be replaced with a psion 
---
Because titans are kinda just good on their own and don't need exotics to make them playable. Everything that's useful is already implemented in their skill trees, not their exotics.
---
Weapon buffs, melee buffs, ability recharge, infinite add clear super, the best debuff in the game, auto reloading, self healing, etc.
---
Lol thanks you dont have to my dude. I had actually typed out a semi cryptic message about how those quests were great quests with good rewards especially that warmind engram but decided to go with the direct approach because i know you're losing your mind right now lol. Funny enough the last gun i needed was 18 kelvins and i grinded for 6 days 12+ hours a day doing nodes and just so happened to complete those missions while grinding (after i noticed i was working on them i started focusing on them while grinding to feel like i wa as being "efficient") and turned in the warmind engram and got it. I was a little salty lmfao
---
should've , could've , would've , but you didn't.  so leave me alone.
---
Alright. Hope you have a nice day and a decent New Year's you very smart, intelligent, enlightened being. :)
---
Do let me know when you DO finish Dogs with 3 people!
---
Goodbye
---
It depends on what you're fighting, but in general the Huckleberry is more niche than the Riskrunner. You basically use the Huckleberry over the Riskrunner only if you're primarily clearing adds (bosses really mess up the Huckleberry's rhythm) AND you don't expect to reliably take arc damage from anything to proc Riskrunner. In other words, Huckleberry is for Hive or Scorn swarms, Riskrunner is for Taken and Fallen, and I don't like to use either for Cabal.
---
Is it a guaranteed one? I had 3/4 but I got a duplicate on my second character :/
---
Wow thanks for the platinum man i appreciate it :D
---
I mean im just going off the sample pool of 5 people i know, including myself, needing 11 weapons total and none of us getting dupes
---
Sure it is skill, cheesy yes, but still requires skill to wield. If you gave me these items it would make little difference as I would still be crap, cos I don‚Äôt have the skills to utilise them. 
---
Anything short of aim boting requires skill.  
---
People who run similar type of ‚Äúcheesy‚Äù builds know what works well to exceed in PVP and why not, if it gets the job done efficiently and win you the game then milk it till they nerf it. 
---
shoot things with gun
---
Which one were you missing?
---
Thanks so much for the suggestion!!  Turns out that there is somewhat of a shortcut in that characters that haven't done the first part of the sleeper (or polaris?) quest, you get a guaranteed non-dupe! Going to give it a shot!
---
Should I bring a sword?

That's how mafia works ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

I have one of these (although a different variant) and it's awesome. Worth the $15 if you like Destiny for sure!
---
Yikes
---
Shame this garbage is still a thing, especially since Bungie already 'fixed' it 2 times now...
---
What shader is that?
---
Yuuuppp. I got a lucky 1 vs 4. One guy ran around trying to fist bump, one sat patiently, and 2 assholes tag teamed the power ammo and killed me 30 whatever times to ruin my day and finish control. Super f*cking fun
---
When you have the correct path so that you can hit crit shots on your golden gun, the nighthawk makes you do insane damage which is more than all 6 shots combined. 
---
Also Fenris from Dragon Age 2, and the generic male Imperial soldier in Skyrim.

I've been calling it the chuckleberry since that's all I do when I use it.

Please post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/89vbwr/official_lfg_megathread_version_20/?sort=new) instead, look at the LFG dropdown menu on the top bar of the subreddit for various LFG tools, or check the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/8ji06r/official_faq_please_read_before_posting/) for possibly helpful advice on how to find people to play with our advertise/find clans.

This is an issue much of the community is facing and as far as I've seen no explanations have arisen. I might be wrong though, a good place to search would be Bungie's help twitter (@bungiehelp) or their Help section on the website. 
---
Have you done 2 powerful? You only get too chose 2 each weeks. 
---
Huckleberry with catalyst, Arsenic Bite &amp; Avalanche is my favourite loadout by a country mile.
---
Well i mean it's certainly fun, but hanging out in the open isn't really ever the right move. Threat level + orchid (or nation of beasts) + exotic power weapon is my go-to loadout, can't really go wrong with that. Dragonfly spec is currently broken as far as I know.

Oh yeah dusk rock blues for sure, with a primary weapon you can sort of get away with anything really if it's pve

I took one look at the title requirements, laughed extra hard, said ‚Äúyeah right, you wish your game was good enough for me to do this bs‚Äù &amp; never thought about them again.

---
I basically nolifed Izanami with the pulse rifles for the last half so it might be a little skewed, but I did have roughly 100 Gofannon clears on hand without any weapon forged so maybe not. Regardless, outside of forged frames, all of them seem to drop about the same quality rolls for normal BA weapons, not much of a trend at all.
---
There are also no special armor drops, all blues/purples are from Season 4 basically, like most other activities.
---
Lol, I think you may be Sir üòâ
---
I agree, that is why pvp balance *must* be completely separate from pve.
---
Or "ban" certain items from competitive.
---
But just allowing all the "fun" overpowered pve things into a competitive pvp turns it into a joke.
---
As a pc player you should get that emblem just like us mustard rice people just saying 
---
Most of those kills were with shotguns (meta, no doubt).
---
No

A Thousand Wings? 
---
Huh? 
---
I've heard that it was a pro male gamer who wanted to prove that girls have it easy in esports so he tried to prove it. But when he was caught he said that it was a social experiment and now people think that he was doing it to prove all the harassment female gamers face. Is this pretty much what's going on?
---
Side note: It really bothers me how oblivious and obnoxious the gaming community is towards any kind of social problems that arise from having a huge male population. Like I love video games, but there is a reason why more girls don't start playing. I think the worst example of this in recent memory was the BFV controversy where people couldn't realize that EA didn't have a girl on the cover to make a social statement but rather that it would make them more money if girls could identify with the character they are playing as.
---
I'd like to say based on my time in the crucible and the kills I put in to support my team I've earned my right to abuse this exotic until its inevitable nerf
---
When the hive just give up fighting and it ignore you 
---
With raids, it is very important that players understand there's something more to it than "shoot bad guy until dead." Random matchmaking would not solve the issue of players not knowing that, causing any random raid group to go like day 1 raids but worse (as in, several hours longer than necessary). 
---
To date it has not been fixed - have gotten all chests every week on all 3 characters including all chests in the shattered throne when they were available. No word from Bungie on whether it will ever be fixed. Apparently when you get a week‚Äôs chests it erases all previous chest progress for the Triumph.
---
 The mechanics are too complicated for some players for it to allow general matchmaking. It would be a mess. I've seen people struggle with mechanics as simple as passing the ball in the corrupted strike.
---
 I wish that a matchmaking system existed in the game. It would make a lot of people's lives easier. But, it seems that it isn't very practical.
---
You have a few options for a group finder. Theres an lfg subreddit (I'm pretty sure). There's a couple lfg websites for all kinds of activities. But the best option I would say is the companion app for mobile devices. Under the ""Fireteams"" Tab, you can either create your own fireteam that other people can join, or you can specifically look for activities you're interested in.
---
Hope that this helps!
---
8 don't personally find WC an issue, I'd rather they kill me with that and get 1 maybe 2 kills of someone else is near than have a TL or another MG and wipe the team 
---
Fair point about BFV, but when have EA ever made a smart decision? I mean, am I right or am I right?
---
Soooo... you want the no land beyond back from d1?
---
Also this is your own comment with only your own upvote
---
Should‚Äôve been an infinity snake?
---
I see your point and it's solid.
---
I'd like old exotics but in addition to new exotics
---
Ruin wings were cool but they turned that into perks that can roll on armor, would be nice for destiny fashion though.
---
So weird going back to D1 and not seeing my Warlock float
---
No reason to only play one, get through the story on all 3 and play the one you like, or grind all 3 so you level your light faster :)
---
I think your on to something. I'll go a few days off and pick up all kinds of loot on day one and then it'll dry up by the end of the week. Got 5 exotics in one night after a few day break. Granted 3 of them were from eververse but my recents tab had 1 shader and all yellows 
---
I understand dude. I play support all the time but usually because I can‚Äôt get kills so I gotta do my part in another way.
---
Actually I did a LFG leviathan with a deaf player, so obvi no mike. We had them run the gauntlet and type 1, 2, or three for top, middle, bottom respectively. Took a few extra attempts, but felt really rewarding to adapt.
---
Never claimed it to not be
---
I was basing it on just having one as a companion rather than actually becoming a guardian. That would be rather wonderful too :P
---
Mulligan is not bad on a machine gun. 
---
Are they planning that? That would be great.
---
Decisions are hard
---
Lol. You're such a loser. Is this game so important to your miserable life that you have to come at people on online forums in the name of honor? LMFAO. Fuck outta here
---
I got it last week from xur as random exotic. Ive used it in pvp, pretty fun and easy to use but kill myself about half of the time :/ 
---
I never seen that exotic what does it do
---
excuse u saint-14's helm was the shit in D1
---
Is it too far to say heavies as well?
---
No, begone bot
---
Thanks 
---
&gt;I've watched videos on YouTube that say to go to Aphelion's Rest and there are other videos that say the location changes each week
---
There are 6 different ascendant challenges, and they rotate from week to week. You know which one it is because Toland's quote on the bounty gives you a hint on where to go. Some, like this week's, are very obvious, while other week's hints are very vague. 
---
Once you enter the right area, there is a message in the bottom left corner saying, "the seams between realities grow weaker." When you are very close to the portal you can hear it make sounds. To see the portal, you use a tincture of queensfoil. This gives you a buff that allows you to see and enter the portal, and also some hidden chests and platforms all around the city. 
---
I find the guides on [this website](https://www.shacknews.com/article/101225/destiny-2-complete-strategy-guide#d2-dreaming-city) to be very helpful. [This youtuber posts a video every week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ULI5IsnRro&amp;t=342s) for the ascendant challenges, though he sometimes goes kind of fast. 
---
I got the ship last week and have still been grinding frames. Curious to know if you have gotten any frames that have dropped masterworked already? I‚Äôve completed 108 frames and have not got a curated roll as of yet. 
---
That's a lotta damage!
---
can you carry me too then?
---
It‚Äôs weird. It‚Äôs a drop from a frame and a normal drop from the forges. 
---
Bro, someone just came here and downvoted our comments for no reason 
---
I did play D1. All 3 years. And who hired bungie. I thought bungie developed destiny....
---
This isn't an LFG sub.
---
Rule 13.
---
/r/Fireteams 
---
Primaries and energies only
---
Not as far as I'm concerned. I don't think they can even drop curated, can they?
---
Grind on one character just to experience it then quick upgrade. 
---
I‚Äôd play through the content with your main, and use the upgrade on a secondary character 
---
Activision hired them on D1 I remember there was a reddit post about it when it was going on. 
---
Pretty sure there aren't any on Mercury or Titan.  Earth, Nessus, Tangled Shore, Dreaming City.
---
...
---
Telesto baby

**You are absolutely not allowed to post other people's personally-identifiable information.**
---
That's witch-hunting, and it will get you permanently banned.
---
This is your only warning. 
---
For whining 
---
ah, okay, will keep in mind next time. 
---
The OP is about it being a no skill exotic. But i bet you upvoted that didnt you? Technically thats whining
---
That was my point, I'm on xbox 
---
You can actually tell if it is the sparrow or not before picking it up, if it has the sparkles around it like prime engrams do then its a normal exotic and if it doesn't than it is the otherside.
---
Why is that any less "dumb" than Monday? 
---
Because Monday is when the actual week starts
---
Dont fear. The are many educated voices that remain silent and they outnumber the negative ones. One thing is for sure, the whiners will whine and if you don't play the game the way they want you to, they will whine some more.
---
Well the meme in the OP is about crucible, so posting your setup and then saying you rarely do crucible is a bit off topic... 
---
at least your vault is a thing lol
---
someone just got spoiled huhu
---
&gt;As an Ordained Priest in the Church of the Dude
---
Lmao you're so cool
---
OEM doesn't give a health buff either while tracking. That only applies after you kill the marked target. Now a second person could get marked while the Titan still has the over shield, but they should run away instead of dueling a buffed Titan. 
---
Thanks bro!
---
Ya know, if you do more drugs and bang more chicks, you too could be the towering inferno of sexy coolness that i am, i believe in you.
---
That is pretty bad. But like yoh said I think you just need to keep playing or stick to pve if it is really not enjoyable. 
---
U should be castrated u degenerate 
---
&gt; I could be wrong. I'm not an expert on costing my team the match.
---
Not an expert on paying attention to what you comment on either.  Isnt it just a little bit interesting they lost a round where the other team hadn't even summoned the primeval?
---
Pay attention next time.  It's not fucking hard.
---
With Ace, Bygones, and what I assume to be two shotties? Glad you lived to tell the tale..
---
r/reasonswhyidonthaveagirlfriend
---
Weird, because the rest of the game was ok. Where is the connection bar?
---
Imagine your kids growing up to be this dude.
---
That defeats the purpose of their ornaments that people pay money for 
---
It's the thing to the right of your name when you bring up all the players. It's happened to me before where I just start lagging a ton and then it goes back to normal right after. It's especially annoying when it brings you to the title screen.
---
I used my Titan with sweet business and the Actium war rig.  That got me through the multi kills quite quick
---
It's funny, when you preview a shader it will shade your exotic too!
---
I read this in a female's voice from the first sentence but Zavala slowly took over as I read further...
---
That sounds like a good idea, but of course Bungo probably won't add it lol
---
Or, hear me out here, Bungie could implement a system that checks to see if both teams are full before starting the match.  And if players leave within the first 20 seconds, then cancel the match in a draw while giving the leavers a loss and heavy penalty.  Plenty of games do exactly this for gametypes where there is no backfill.  Is that so difficult?  People don't *want* to play at a very noticable disadvantage in competitive.  It isn't fun, win or lose, for many players to be in that situation.  And when it happens multiple times in a row, which it absolutely does, it's extremely draining to be on the receiving end of the bullshit.  Players shouldn't be forced to play at a player disadvantage with the threat of punishment if they don't.  It's a simple concept, whether you personally like it or not.
---
could always wait for another week
---
Personally I would like to see primeval damage done after the last round in Gambit
---
Will it really? See now that's frustrating. Lol. 
---
Threat level opened up all the fun energy weapons for us . Icarus dash gets you to safety quickly and air kills get your abilities back very fast . If you get the tyranny bow give the build a few rounds of volunder as it seems to shine there . Forges in general are great for trying out different builds.  I didn't know dragonfly spec was busted though 
---
Bungie should just change out "motes lost" for "Motes Denied" because imo thats a way more interesting stat that goes nicely woth the "Guardians defeated" stat.
---
If they had different levels of the same raid, matchmaking would work. A normal mode with matchmaking gives general mechanics. Hard mode adds mechanics and difficulty without matchmaking. 
---
This would allow people to warm up to the raids and get an idea of what to do. 
---
Yeah realized this one a bit too late, now I have a low LL Titan who will never be good because I don't want to grind on that character.
---
Hit me up. I'll be on a good portion of the day Friday: sn0ttypippen
---
The ornaments on armor can have shaders applied to them. The ornaments typically change the shape and patterns of exotics, I don't think reshading them would be a big issue. 
---
Yup...some exotics look banging with the right shader.
---
A general scoreboard should get a revamp imo, there are way more interesting stats to view then what they are currently displaying.
---
You mean full choke?  That's been proven to be significantly better than a range increasing barrel, hitting more pellets makes the shotgun more consistently do more damage at longer ranges than just going for higher range.  The rest, however, is exactly what you'd want.
---
Can someone tell me which shader is that? Yellow-White-Brown-Yellow ish one?
---
Aww
---
You gonna cry?
---
This. Practice is only useful if it is constructive practice. Playing without thinking about changing your tacs isn't useful practice. So follow other players, thats helpful, you'll learn stuff. Source; I suck but I'm getting better.
---
That's why I use all exotic emotes and endgame emblems on the new character.
---
Cry with laughter most probably. You're actually quoting fucking Big Lebowski and thinking you're the cool one. Oh dear. 
---
They better not monetize the feature if they do add it. Like your character creation is already one of the worst in modern games lol... I definitely would never pay money to change 1 or 2 things on my character. 
---
[sad trombone]
---
I agree. The counter to evil is villainy. 
---
Still crying hippy.
---
I dont have to think im the cool one, i simply am.
---
Yeah I bet... well hopefully Bungie is talking about it. I like having suave guardian equipment whether it be for protectin' or killin' 
---
That's why D1 Y1 was the tits.  Beat it with one char and the others didnt have to fuck with story.
---
You just assume that majority of motes lost goes to the player with most guardians defeated
---
You seem like the kind of guy who complains about the throw move in fighting games because it goes through your block.  There's no such thing as honor, use anything within the rules of the game, don't apologize for it ever.  The game don't give a shit about your honor and neither do we.
---
Good point. Although Imo that‚Äôs kind of overkill
---
It does. I always forget to check it and don‚Äôt usually use it since it takes you out of the game. It might also be in the mobile Xbox app.
---
&gt; I dont have to think im the cool one, i simply am.
---
You actually believe this. Oh dear. 
---
True, and exotic ships and sparrows.
---
My soul hurts just looking at this pic
---
A weapon to surpass metal gear!
---
Not sure why you are surprised.  Very little of the promotional stuff is about the pvp aspect.  
---
It's like being surprised people are more interested in Assassin's Creed story than pvp.
---
Thank you for the explanation! I tried this combo for the first time today and one-shotted mini-bosses in strikes. Key is to get that precision shot, otherwise, it's not a big bonus.
---
I laughed 
---
No, not at all actually. 
---
I just feel like a denied motes stat goes better with the current displaying thats, and it gives a insight on how well or shitty people are invading to deny motes
---
Its sorta like gravity.
---
It is what it is whether you believe it or not.
---
Forge 100 frames.
---
I worry that same thing! I have the Wayfarer title, which you can apply to all your characters once you earn it on one, so I think that probably helps show I know what I am doing. 
---
Yes, because LL only matters in like 2 things right now.
---
They can‚Äôt.
---
You're*. 
---
I knew I couldn't be the only one!
---
There are no curated Forge weapons.
---
Actually
---
Yo‚Äôre‚Äô*
---
Jackass
---
It‚Äôs one of the blue ones - sorry, I deleted it, can‚Äôt remember the name
---
I didn‚Äôt make this post expecting a Bungie employee to hand down the Ace from on high, or to have them rewrite the quest, or anything like that.  Frankly, I‚Äôd be kind of insulted if making a whiny reddit post was enough to solicit that kind of handout.
---
I just needed to vent regarding my frustrations with the quest, and between complaining on Reddit and punching my computer screen out of pure frustration, I chose to go with the slightly less expensive way of venting.
---
Anyway, as for the one part of your post that had merit: Rumble worked like a charm.  
---
I found one exactly like yours and it‚Äôs awesome
---
Who's @nerdxvision?
---
‚ÄúOh, I cannot wait
---
To see what you‚Äôll do with that,
---
Guardian‚Äù - Love, Shaxx
---
Not your fault Bungie can't balance the game. I'm playing Titan until I get one and wearing it until it's trash. OP items are fun. When nothing is OP, you are left with Y1 D2
---
Yup lol
---
PVP is strange. Not to long ago those would of been all hunters with worn husk. I‚Äôd totally be into PVP more if the meta had more variety. 
---
The warlock feel lonely between all the hunters
---
So what false claim did he make?  Because last I had seen, "wonky" isn't a quantifiable amount.
---
Dont pretend you're always right because you're a mod.  Well, I guess that must be why you finally stopped using green text for your personal opinions?  Maybe in another year you'll believe other people get to have an opinion too?
---
And in fact with a regular weapon you just shoot their leg, they stumble backwards and you shoot them in the head. They die.
---
Now if only phalanxes would do the same instead of being like "deploy 180 degree floor to ceiling fuck you shield"
---
Don't give up, just play in crucible with a ghost that boost your xp gains in the crucible, even if you lose, you can still level up very fast !
---
The LFG on Xbox is great and very fast. If you add me I‚Äôll run you through. ImaPoopinBRBvii
---
I have 2 other characters, both at 650 already, with Thunderlord and Horror Story (Festival of the Lost Auto Rifle), both of which have a level requirement of only 20 regardless of Power.  Simply transferred from the other characters/vault and rocked it from Level 30 to 50, which was funny because due to the high power from the weapons I was getting armor dropped I couldn't even use at that low of a Level.  Once I hit 50 I moved a 650 energy weapon over as well and it was off to the races.  Every thing that dropped as armor dropped 60+ power higher than the piece i was using.  It snowballed from there.
---
Don‚Äôt feel bad ..for ten seconds I thought that Anonymous Autumn was Anonymous Autism
---
For cabal phalanxes Ikora mutters about their weakness: the very center of their shield.  They take crit damage and undeploy their shield.  I don't think it works against Taken phalanxes though.
---
Farewell sweet prince
---
why
---
I'm pretty sure that's a web-like star shaped spider ship from a Dr.Who christmas episode lol 
---
Your roll on the retold tale probably isn‚Äôt great. Or just get closer 
---
I‚Äôd have to check the documents to see if it has an official name, but it‚Äôs (if I‚Äôm remembering right) a cognitive processing disorder.  Long story short, I have troubles with processing high amounts of incoming information in short periods of time.
---
When your comment has the desired effect&gt;using a shotty in crucible
---
Bungie should be ashamed
---
Okay I'm bored of you, ignored. 
---
Yeah and combine those buff with empowering from well of radiance and it‚Äôs a one shot
---
Same with Corrupted
---
Lol
---
Im the loser
---

---
No it is not. They were only available last year
---
Nope. They will eventually return but at the moment the factions aren't available nor are the catalysts. 
---
Gamechanging honestly
---
It should say shotguns tho
---
They are currently unobtainable. Faction rallies was temporarily removed due to bad player feedback. It will be back, but we have no idea when. 
---
Take the politics somewhere else 
---
That was pretty much my reaction when I first learned about needing to escape shruggie punctuation characters, yeah.
---
I don't consider half a second of combat a 1v1
---
I am 43 and have played a lot of Destiny 1 on PS3/PS4 (up to The Taken King)  - and just bought Destiny 2 for the Xbox One X.  I am level 23 currently and somewhere around 225 light.  Are there any other older Xbox users here?
---
On a side note, after being away from the game for awhile, it's astonishing how well it plays/feels.
---
But the original post, was, about politics...?
---
Tfw no friends are online but you want to do some missions/raids/etc so you play with randoms. I can excuse some deaths or being bad but seriously, it's like everytime you play with randoms they pass the controller to their 6 year old cousin.
---
Thanks! Just had the same problem and it was a since once I changed specs. I was really trying not to change specs since I just used seed of life on a different energy and am trying to level it up.
---
This is not the way you do it, OP. First, "spreading" is when you spot somebody else comment, and second, you should hide copypasta in your post properly. For example, you should at least remove capital letter at the beginning of copypasta to conceal, or it'd be too obvious. To make sure it don't draw too much attention until it's too late, just look at them, they come to this place when they know they are not pure. Tenno use the keys, but they are mere trespassers. Only I, Vor, know the true power of the Void. I was cut in half, destroyed, but through its Janus Key, the Void called to me. It brought me here and here I was reborn. We cannot blame these creatures, they are being led by a false prophet, an impostor who knows not the secrets of the Void. Behold the Tenno, come to scavenge and desecrate this sacred realm. My brothers, did I not tell of this day? Did I not prophesize this moment? Now, I will stop them. Now I am changed, reborn through the energy of the Janus Key. Forever bound to the Void. Let it be known, if the Tenno want true salvation, they will lay down their arms, and wait for the baptism of my Janus key. It is time. I will teach these trespassers the redemptive power of my Janus key. They will learn its simple truth. The Tenno are lost, and they will resist. But I, Vor, will cleanse this place of their impurity.
---
I know,  directed to both of you.  The news and most other media is flooded with this garbage. Video game forums should be about video games.  Take that crap somewhere else, dont care which side you're on.
---
Plz set up a case plz I want justice 
---
Love it, it‚Äôs one of my crutch guns. Just not for pvp
---
^^ See? Politics...saying Sarah Sanders dodges, assuringly, reporters, majority of which, are Liberal, so KMA? 
---
No, hunters dodge. Lol. 
---
#originalpost
---
Yeah, he was complaining -_- u/mindmaster (probably is his reddit)
---
Was going to say the same thing 
---
Took 2 of my memes both from me
---
You pretty much hit all of the things there.  Do Forsaken plus a couple public event's and then do the mission to get into the dreaming city.  I just started a Warlock on friday and already have her up  to 627 with minimal effort.  If you have Thunderlord and/or Horror Story they only have a Level 20 requirement no matter what their power is if that helps.
---
Fair enough
---
That is good to know. Thank you. So what I‚Äôve seen is just rolls people think are the best possible rolls for that specific weapon?
---
Easily one of my favourite guns in the game. Helped me defeat Dul Incaru solo as well! 
---
What was your card?
---
Good bot
---
Arc singe, Heavyweight, Momentum. No handicap. Pretty basic, but still took alot of practice.
---
It‚Äôs great in the gofannon forge, makes the forge super easy. 
---
*human
---
There was nowhere here where i didnt say they couldnt.... he knew the risk of leaving....came here and pissed and moaned... a more helpful thread would have Been "idea for competitive "
---
it wins the entire game basically
---
I legit got it like thirty minutes ago mate, hardest part definitely was the precision shots in crucible seeing as how I‚Äôm not too big of a fan of pvp 
---
Plus DOT burning effects, snare and fire lanterns as well as group invulnerability lanterns, and thier minibosses fucking suck 
---
AMEN
---
Yeah nah, nice work dude. I respect that run.
---
^^^not wrong
---
Same here mate , most annoying part , but was a nice challenge! We will enjoy it now üòÇ
---
I got it then immediately got threat level and blast furnace. Haven‚Äôt used it since. But I agree it‚Äôs a weapon everyone should have because of how unique it is. 
---
Yep
---
Definitely, I‚Äôm enjoying it. Wish it had a kill counter built in or a way to get it. I‚Äôd find that pretty rewarding lol
---
Thanks for all the quick replies! I‚Äôm going to grind with my Hunter main, might do the same with my Titan. I actually don‚Äôt mind the grind, it‚Äôs especially fun when it‚Äôs doing campaign and adventures rather than hitting the same lost sector 20x. üòÖ I‚Äôll probably hit my warlock with the upgrade, just to skip that whole low-level slog.
---
Power rangers would at least have one titan but cool SS though 
---
I‚Äôve only ever played gambit to get the breakneck. Then I‚Äôm done. Never again lol
---
This post made by code of the missile gang
---
Haven‚Äôt tried it in PVP, doesn‚Äôt seem very applicable
---
Not to brag or anything but i play destiny with my boyfriend ;) 
---
God send against hand cannon/ shot gun freaks gives me a chance
---
If you don't mind me Asking what gun are using on the boss?
---
Thunderlord! 
---
Isn't it great!? Little things like teaming up on someone in the crucible or melting a Gambit boss together... Brings couple's together.
---
Tyvm much for info btw amazing run grats
---
This is actually hilarious. Stop crying
---
ootl, what are Shaxx and Zavala top two at?
---
If you have Le Monarque thats where it appears in collections.
---
No handicap means it's essentially a normal strike. Either way, lucked out on getting the ship
---
I haven't used it on my main warlock or my hunter... May use it on titan
---
My boyfriend, DoTheTango, and I settle arguments via private matches, so I always get to decide what we do now.
---
I should try this. Problem is she is getting much better...
---
Happened for the better of me a while ago where the last guy on the enemy team hit my buddy who was defusing like 3 times and did no damage giving us the win lol. Feels bad for him though
---
The emblems are still in my collections wtf are you on about?

I‚Äôd also like blocker damage to be shown. Might be initiative for people to stop ignoring them. 
---
But that makes sense. When you see a person using a Not Forgotten there gonna be great cause they got Not Forgotten. When you see a person with luna there gonna be good because they managed to get the weapon. It's no surprise that when a good or great player has a good exotic your gonna have a bad time. A bad hunter wont be able to take advantage of gwevien vest like a bad titian wont be able to take advantage of OEM, but will make those bad hunter be impossible to kill at times. Honestly there is no real problem everyone just wants another wormhusk or  ursa fruriso to complain about.
---
The thing i like about forsaken is a story that hasnt ended yet and we get more stuff every week trough dreaming city
---
Lol, my boyfriend was once in your position. He never thought teaching me to be a badass in crucible was going to backfire on him one day. 
---
Imagine teaching her something and she uses it on you CONSTANTLY. On D1, he taught me the smoke/gernade combo on nightstalker and things have never been the same for him. I just evolved from there. 
---
People do this every week.  Get the one he is selling first then come back when you have enough for the random one.
---
Probably just another dupe
---
Do you know what ‚ÄúOC‚Äù means
