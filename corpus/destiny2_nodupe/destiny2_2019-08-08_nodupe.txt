Now I k ow what it is like from these types of players' point of view lmao
---
It is a perk that allows forgivenes for missing shots, which is nice. However if you miss you are not going to have the time to kill 5+ gaurdians with goldy. Odds are if five guardians are within grasps and you miss 1 shot then that guy kills you or mr 4 or 5 does when you double check due to having 0 extra health.
---
Shit, can I be your friend?
---
How the fuck?! How would the guy killed before the grenade have been killed as well?!
---
Today I learned.
---
If you hop into gambit and crucible with a bad connection you make the experience worse for other players. You’ll probably get reported and bungie takes action as they should
---
Foetracer can mark enemies for 5 seconds without them damaging you, while OEM can do so when being damaged. Also the buff is active for only 8 seconds after a kill.
---
Hive. Boomer.
---
Big brain play: sit on the edge of the dome so you can shoot inside but don’t burn
---
Thanks a bunch! Think I need to shoot for one of those myself~
---
Wait, this is a desirable shotgun? I've dismantled like a dozen of these in the last 6 months and I'm a filthy causal. Thought it was a common legendary and only kept one so I could complete shotgun bounties. I did fall in love with it and masterwork it.  
---

---
I burn through bosses with this. As a Titan I am always in the faces of enemies anyway felt like a match.
---
Fix that photo bud, doubt you want that name everywhere
---
Same as balistic slam or laser beam
---
Isn't that about the 35th time he said 'impossible?'
---
Or everybody relies too much on streamers opinions because they weren’t considered bad until the hive mind got told what to believe.
---
Purge the xeno scum
---
You can either do castellum ( flags in the beginning ) again or you can go underbelly to where you left off. And yes after the weekly reset I believe it removes the checkpoint.
---
One more thing. If you are wanting to get a checkpoint, make sure you get into the encounter and do a wipe. If you don't wipe at least once it will not give you the checkpoint. Good luck
---
Imo Mayhem should have more players using lasting supers instead of one use supers like blade barrage and nova bomb. I think this was more fun
---
I giggled at this. Awesome job.
---
The most impressive thing in this clip was surviving long enough in one spot to shoot an entire clip, reload, and throw a hammer.
---
Any time I try to get two shots in I get a full body cavity search by two fisting-hungry Titans.
---
*It's enough to make a grown man cry*
---
Yeah, it's mostly the instax suppers kinda bumming the mode. But imagine a mode where you can only use roaming supers and you're in a super the entire game
---
Proper usage of The Big Dick Energy
---
when u mean wipe u mean die right?
---
Ye so me and my buddies left off at the guantlet so we can just do the guantlet flags and were good?
---
Are you using the same subclass element as todays elemental burn?
---
[With a bit of fantasy we can let 'em pass as hive...](http://static.nautil.us/11902_63f35343d6f9681cad0598452a17f0df.jpg)
---
You have to match the daily element with your subclass.
---
What? The peacock doesn’t abruptly dodge and boop you from the map. It’s not a true representation of the strike.
---
Still holding on to my trials tokens...
---
Yeah but fallen don't use flamethrowers.
---
Was not even aware of this. Was wondering how I got 250/300 then it “breaks”
---
Wasnt even aware of this. Was wondering how I got 250/300 then it “breaks”
---
Yeah when you go to castellum it will make you do the flags for gauntlet as long as the fireteam leader has that checkpoint. And yeah by wipe I mean start the encounter and just die once, then it will give you the checkpoint
---
Because they’re cry babies and can’t handle a little grind.
---
Yep.
---
Ace if spades is easy to get and very powerful.
---
Yeah, I saw that In my recommended too.
---
Or maybe not. Now i'm getting the cold shoulder. :')
---
Wow nice design
---
Results are not good but it should be okay eventually!!! (I hope)
---
I’m gonna dive into the free version of D2 when it comes out in the fall and less busy - what is the best recap / story universe primer for me to know before jumping in?

Well it’s just by now most games would get another game, but they don’t want to do that(thankfully)
---

---
Well the forsaken annual pass is on sale for $15, would that help my cause?
---
I got it on my first and only last wish raid completion.
---
Depends on what version of the game you have. If you have the base game or if you have any DLC; the big ones, as well as season passes.
---
Basically if you don't have them, the only endgame thing for you to play is the Leviathan raid. 
---
If your copy of the game includes Forsaken, you get all the content up to the release of Forsaken.

In the case of a warlock the word "Brightest" serves as a double entendre.
---
Well the annual pass has black armory, scourge of the past raid, gambit prime, reckoning, menagerie, crown of sorrow raid, I mean I wouldn’t recommend it because you can’t buy forsaken separately because if you want it later it would be 40 bucks still(unless price drop but it would still be bundled with annual pass and year 1 stuff)
---
HA! I thought it was because they're new to the game and rocking blue gear still... didn't even think about this.
---
The chaperone one that increases the barrel length
---
Oh yeah cool man.
---
Do the eaz miniboss cheese. Boom
---
The year one dlcs are already free
---
Had some level 37 clown run up so I say “don’t kill” and what does his dumbass do? Kills the boss after I put “DONT. KILL.” When he popped his super on it. I’m actually pissed about it still
---
If it’s stupid and it works, then it ain’t stupid.
---
Nice
---
That's my issue. I can't find where to download them at. When I go to the expansions Xbox store, it only tells me to redeem a code. That's why I asked of the dlcs are already included in the D2 download
---
While its tru that no magic number exist because its different for everyone.. lowering ur sensitivity to force u to aim with ur arm rather than ur wrist is almost always better once u acclimate... using larger muscles is better for memory of said muscles and u can do larger movements with ur arm and more precise ones with ur wrist
---
This is the love child of Jötunn and Skyburner
---
Solo blade barrage on an invasion target....
---
Only the base game at the moment. had the game about a week. Dont even see the leviathan raid anywhere. Its not even letting me do daily heroics. It does say in my milestones tab  "the red war, speak to zavala at the tower, but whenever i go to him it just brings up rewards, bounties and persuits. No other options.
---
Low key karma whoring because everyone knows OG mars is best mars

They should already be installed i dont believe you need to download anything

Dreaming city waves, you have to like, shoot the blights and then you get booped to the ascendant realm and you kill big boi knight and wizards. I think

Oh yeah! That too. Love the description of that

And one that had zero motes as well.......
---
Yeah, one or two ghost fragments isn't worth the difference between 20 and 200 seconds for me.
---
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
---
-breathes-
---
HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
---
Phew..
---
We already have queens breaker tho, a vandal wep. The only difference would be solar. Not worth it tbh but a good thought
---
If you buy it you can play it
---
Ahh you see I can recommend a strategy little used try using a parcel of stardust with assault mag and full auto + rampage go for long ass 2 taps instead of close 1s and laugh at apes to your hearts content
---
Thanks I hate it
---
Ok so it is that, no little gimmick like with regular ones, gotcha
---
This is beautiful.
---
I actually didn’t consider that the glows being so expensive could tie into it, that does make some sense.
---
And yeah, the 100 mini bosses was stupid, but if you just do some research you can save yourself a lot of time, namely the workaround of getting all the kills in one go.
---
You can do that from a distance, but you're guaranteed to get booped if you try it up close. Not enough time to find a weak spot before their shield blast activates.
---
Quite the assassination.
---

Blade barrage is broken in mayhem with shards tho 1 kill basically insta fills it back

Sometimes some of the challenges can get weirdly out of sync across resets. I've noticed it with Benedict's weekly challenge for opening chests, as well as Ikora's for doing bounties. Next weekly reset should clear it up.
---
He needed to be level 50 to get the armor at a higher power level.
---
and what are you getting out of pvp little bird?
---
So is he shit out of luck?
---
Until he gets his blue set, yep.
---
Funny considering snipers do both of those things better and so do shotguns hand canons and hell even pulse rifles so maybe you should learn some stuff before opening your mouth. Also good job limiting your response to one game mode only especially having that game mode being gambit of all things.
---
My favorite part about telling the truth is that nobody gives me any counter examples.
---
to that I present Chaperone, Lord of Wolves, Queenbreaker, Telesto, Ace of Spades, Last Word, Thorn, and especially Hardlight. all of them gad significant changes, Hardlight in fact went through TWO significant changes. first was being converted to an energy weapon that you could change the element of by changing perks, second was simplifying all that to a reload. all of them went through one or more changes instead of simply vopying the codes/data over.
---
Would be a huge upgrade for titans look. But somehow bungo will still make it look like a NFL player
---
HOLY FUCK, comeon bungo we need stuff like this.
---
your point is quite valid and noted, but are there any on this list you disagree with or feel like would change the game in a good, fun way?
---
Those shoulder pads GOTTA GO
---
How are you 479 light?
---
This whole game is just a pure grind
---
No it was on the glass panes
---
I swear is it actually possible to get all those vents without dying at least once, even when you have people helping you?
---
Hahahaha Jesus, it’s a game dude, the gun is good, get it and you’ll be fine. 
---
Calm down
---
So what would you like to happen?
---
Yeah both have the best communities i've seen in gaming.
---
Discord and though the destiny app
---
Yup, it's t1, then t2, and finally t3.

You need 3 weeks to get every t3 helmet on ONE character
---
Ohhh haha mb.
---
I'm also a connoisseur of clicking on heads
---
IDK why but that made me hurt a lot
---
Moon's delayed
---
You can dismantle them
---
 After SK lunch the stuff will be optain able with shards.
---
As expected
---
How do you get the threat level and is it hard?
---
I tried once but I couldn't find a entrance outside the map
---
Had to find something to be the third comparison, couldn't think of anything else lol
---
play the vanilla and  forsaken and then wait for shadowkeep
---
But a msg in D2 popped up that after SK comes out, it will auto dismantle for shards, so I guess I can safely dismantle now to get enough bright dust I suppose :)
---
I use revoker in pvp and either threat level or go figure in pve depending on what range I need
---
Wasn't she kept out of most of Endgame because she's too OP? That's what I heard
---
Hulk too when using normal Fists of Havoc

Thanks!

---
Haha the sex number
---
You can only get black armory gear from one of the black armories. Forge Saboteurs in the EDZ and Nessus are there for mission completion tasks and bounties.
---
I found it pretty fun it's about personal preference aswell
---
Yeah it’s sexy
---
It's even more frustrating when you notice they jumped over some orbs right in front of them.
---
Looking for this answer as well. Played the free trial on Xbox, but just bought a ps4 to play with friends. Can't buy the full game til next paycheck, but can't seem to find the trial to tide me over. Does it not exist on ps4? Or just not exist at all anymore?

I’ll try that when I go home this weekend. That could be the winner. I was attempting this last week with tree of probs with handicap at 250
---
Ima take that recommendation
---
Lol, not sure the whole story of that but props to that guy for getting that kid. That's a true guardian :)
---
Legit. Just played two matches. One went fine. The other one consisted of me an another lad who were trying. An afk. And a heavy ammo camper. Against a 4stack. Guess how that ended
---
And why they dont add matchmaking for raid?

The phone app is basically a deported matchmaking.

That’s how most of mine are even when I use lfg to get a team
---
A meme thief then eh?
---
You cared enough to comment :D
---
THEN WHY ARE YOU EVEN ARGUING THAT SBMM SHOULD BE A THING? Why is SBMM harmful to anyone other than sweats who enjoy abusing new people and think it's fun but instead you are ruining their experience.
---
I can hear this picture
---
Coldheart? Never saw that when i was grinding gambit.
---
And scouts. 
---
Yeah, I'd like that.
---
The best advice that was ever given to me was this back in my TF2 days. So this all the way.
---
That's my bad guys, I was going for Hush and "mote theif." Not the greatest playstyle.
---
Tuesday.
---
And you cared enough about the game to post a whole video of you uninstalling it to this sub
---
Ditto but I've been in so many matches that were 5 plus minutes longer because the other team had something like 20 motes and we call in the prime evil and they just non stop invade it's like just give up loss move on.
---
It’s today idk what time though
---
I’m asking because I’m also in Canada and the 2 I see are Shadowkeep base dlc for 40$ cnd or the digital deluxe for 70$ cnd   At least on steam anyway
---
I did care about d2 yes. But bungle just disappointed me with the oast year of dlc and they just keep wanting more money, which they honestly don't deserve.
---
Did I say SBMM shouldn’t be a thing?
---
More like at least 1 afk teammate.
---
I have to admit, I had a shit time grabbing motes last night. I'm hoping those 16 invasion kills made up for it though, I've only just got into playing Gambit and while it's addictive I'm finding I can get a bit inconsistent.
---
I’m on PS4 but thank you :)
---
I wonder how many hours he has in D2... just curious
---
u. forgot. bots
---
In around 8 hours. Sometimes a little bit later, other times, a little bit faster
---
I used to use mic all the time but now I only do it in party when I'm playing with my friends rather than randos. I just was not enjoying what they had to say most of the time, literally giving themselves a massive verbal handy I just felt better off not hearing it.
---
It comes out on Thursdays, chief
---
Note Pad Pro for IOS
---
Man, I'm playing with a dying controller with stick drift and yet I still pull my weight. And I HATE gambit and PvP. There is no GOOD excuse for being this shitty. We really need better AFK booting measures
---
Had a guy lose 15 motes back to back because he refused to bank and kept fighting adds.
---
Or when The Drifter says it's time for a primeval and we need 3 more motes, 2 of us have banked, and one guy spends his time getting up to 15 motes while the 4th guy comes in and slams 4 motes into the bank first.
---
Sigh. Happy Solstice.
---
Eith recluse and mountain top you can do damn near anything alone lol
---
ah
---
And Thorn.
---
He's probably loading up nightfall strikes.
---
If I had a fucking dime...
---
Well you got a lot to stick too. Previous content, next year, and possible D3 plans.

yuw seem angwy but de "twud" is it isn't mindwess. I've onwy been kiwwed by twud a few times mysewf, and good pwayews twiviawize it. yuw can even shoot it and it moves swow enough to be shot gunned out of de aiw wif a smood bowe shotty. If yuw awen't wooking fow an invadew de second it says de enemy invasion powtaw is active, yuw awen't doing it wight, it's kinda dat simpwe.

Get a bead on yuw team, if yuw have say, in emewawd cwiffs just fow ease, have a teammate at de beach and de fowest, de invadew WIww spawn in de middwe. de ding is, twud isn't foow pwoof and it's wikewy yuw have foiwed an invadews attempts just by wunning and not even noticing yuw wewe being fiwed at. Titans can make twud wose wocking just by deactivating deiw jump and shouwdew swamming ow bawwistic smashing befowe it gets to de pwoximity point. Wawwocks can icawus dash it and dive bomb it and it just goes stwaight on by. Huntews don't have much to hewp dem out, but de bottom twee woww does actuawwy hewp if yuw use it at de cowwect time, given it doesn't hit de gwound. Stiww yuw can easiwy instant doubwe jump it and yuw bawewy skiwt de pwoximity of it. What I'm saying is it's de singwe easiest weapon type to dodge if yuw awe even kinda awawe. I wiww awways beat a twud usew wif my Hammewhead and suwvive it because fwankwy, it's usewess against anyone who knows what covew is and doesn't gawd stwoww evewywhewe. 
---
If yuw pop in, and just aim and shoot at a decent pwayew who is even swightwy spatiawwy awawe yuw wikewy won't hit dem. Go watch bad pwayews use twud and good pwayews. de use of it is compwetewy diffewent. Bad pwayews aim and fiwe, good pwayews aim, diwect den fiwe. If yuw wunning to covew it's wikewy my wocket won't make it to yuw unwess I angwe it to go awound a cownew, and even den it onwy goes so faw befowe its twacking causes it to waww. Meaning when I aim at yuw, I actuawwy have to wock on den aim de wocket behind yuw wadew considewabwy fow it to hit. If I just aim at yuw and shoot 9 times out of 10 it wiww waww. wMG is FAAAw wowse dan Twud evew wiww be. de kiww potentiaw, ammo and instant hit wecognition make using twud basicawwy pointwess against wMG's.

---
If yuw get mad at twud it's kind of yuw own fauwt. But make no mistake I'm not saying it's a hawd gun to use. wadew easy actuawwy. It's just not as easy to be dat guy dat wipes de entiwe team in 2 seconds as peopwe dink it is. It's aww about positioning, knowwedge of how de wockets wowk in D2 and anticipation of enemy movements. yuw can hate me aww yuw want fow saying dis, but it's de twud. Why do yuw dink comps tend to use wMG's ovew Twud?

Because matchmaking is just to find you random teammates to play with. 
---
LFG is there to find teammates who are good, can communicate and have a goal in mind.
---
No Shadowkeep is completely separate.
---
Nah man you are good, no worries at all. I agree dude the fact that I have to literally HUNT for traction boots is beyond me, and then for PC (besides the added mobility) It's pointless to have traction. SO why the hell is it still a perk at all? it should just be in the game, no option for it nothing like that, just a simple fix. It feel so horrible, running and trying to turn, and lets not even get started on FoV advantages of PC. Like you guys can see so much, and I can't see a fuckign thing not in direct LoS lmao. Jotunn and Truth are ruining my Gambit experience, and I love the game mode. I am just SICK of being killed by those weapons when I literally hardly have time to react at all because FoV, and Traction. 
---
I would 1000000% be a PC player, if the PC's were on average as much as a console (which will never be the case bc lets be real PCs just have better everything).
---
&gt;I've seen Primes dropped in the first damage phase
---
You literally cannot do this. The first damage phase is gated. You can't do more than a third of it's health. Second and onward it's killable.
---
Wasn't me then, I'm PS4.
---
u/Garbolt
---
hopefully this makes you laugh as much as it makes me laugh.
---
I’m being a voice of reason. 
---
I completely understand how SBMM could make things better but I also understand why SBMM isn’t a thing in destiny.
---
Well that's not exactly what was said.
---
Matchmaking shouldn't pair people with god tier stats against noobs. 
---
So again why do I have to go through an extra service to make sure the games mechanic is going to function correctly? Even then it doesn't, and will occasionally pair me against people that literally never played gambit before. It's really fucked that their introductory experience is a total gang bang.
---
Lol
---
I just wish it's crosshair was less...transparent. I dunno why they made it light blue.
---
I generally fail to realize that my team is about to fuck me over. The moment I usually realize it is when I’m knee deep in the enemy’s territory racking up kills and motes. The oh shit moment inevitable comes when the motes start disappearing and my teammates never show up which leaves me overwhelmed by enemies and slow to get back to the bank. Of course, to make matters worse the invader comes in and doesn’t care that one of my teammates is invading, one is jerking their dick and the other is afk.....so who does he hunt? You guessed it. I’m good at defending myself against an invader, but yeah, I’ve lost 15 motes several times.
---
"Bots on the field! Bring a report"
---
Oh man I died that's beautiful. Better than the original 100%!
---
Truth and beloved are ~~the God players~~everyones favorites
---
Titan is not the least played class, imo they are all played similar amounts since you can have all three characters and switch between them. 
---
If your going to strikes and PVE and raids I would say warlock, Titan isn't as strong in those situations.
---
Warlocks are not support or healer per say, they are just another class that has some supporting supers and other things to help.
---
If you can't tell, I main a warlock, but have played all three
---
Hm, then I guess I must have missed their first damage phase 😯 lordy I'm losing my edge, damn newborns fucking me up lol
---
Fair enough.
---
For every ape, or for every spawn?
---
Matching making is random, sometimes you get put on the good team and sometimes you get put on a shitty team. 
---
It’s happened to all of us at one point. 
---
The games mechanics work just fine, just because you lose doesn’t mean it doesn’t work.
---
It's always like one match goes ok but then the game after that is like shitty teammates and some truth and hammerhead tryhards on the other team.
---
I was in the same boat when I got back at the start of Opulence.
---
If you're not running solstice stuff, then you need to just pick one of the many quest pursuits you have and focus on doing a couple steps for that each time you hop on. You'll clear out the quests you've got piled up as well as getting back in the swing of things.
---
I'm actually complaining about the fact that I get paired against people we steamroll with little effort at all. It's not fair to them that matchmaking pairs 4 stacks against people who have never played before. Imo 4 stacks should be paired against 4 stacks. If there aren't enough. Then 3 stacks. 
---
I really don't care if I win or lose, just that I have fun while doing it. I don't have fun against a team of people who can't defend themselves from an angry bee.
---
Masterworking doesn't *need* to be done during solstice. you can do it when ever. You only need solstice for the statue (to upgrade armour tiers)
---
Damn small world
---
Lmao, its Japanese for fox.
---
You must be trolling commenting that it’s my fault I died two seconds off my spawn ? In what way is that my fault, I’m not hopped up on gfuel so I don’t have that half a second reaction time that you do. You keep heading off in your teams of three in tight quarters and get nova bombed and you tell me how that goes
---
Had over 100 kills and 89 motes in a game last night, we still lost handily
---
Destiny 1 Mars, it had so many cool hidden areas to explore, and it had Valus Ta'aurc. Need I say more?
---
*Laughs in healing rift*
---
Oh ok, makes sense. Thanks for the info
---
Xbox. PC this fall
---
I team wiped in gambit 3 times in a row , they still came back when I literally deposited 50 motes, that’s the only motes we got. Someone please play with me
---
I guess you struggle with sneaking past the dogs on the Leviathan, the curse of being dummy thicc.
---
Thanks for the tip
---
😔 yeah can never complete the levathian because of this never even got past dogs no one wants a dummy thicc titan.
---
Nah, cause you are really bad at judgement
---
Oh that might have been what I was seeing. My mistake
---
Every cloud has a silver lining, Master Rahool gives better loot if you let him clap those cheeks
---
What makes you think I havent let him already...?🤔
---
I always assume I spawn into danger. It is now 6v6 on small maps, roaming supers are crazy and Snipers are prevalent. You spawned in cover. You started sprinting towards a close ping on your radar and decided to swap weapons way too late. You could have baited, back peddled, crouched and waited for an audio cue. Anything besides sprint out with your primary waving around into obvious danger.
---
What roll do you have for that tartara’s gaze
---
You're two steps ahead of me

Well that's what happens when you get propelled forward everytime your asscheeks clap

Hi, I stopped playing Destiny after I realized Osiris was just shit. I started playing again last night, and I look forward to being on your team once I remember all the controls.
---
I'm on PC and I need friends.  Tired of bad team mates on top of not doing raids, nightfalls, Leviathan runs, and generally any activity that involves friends.
---
Captain over Knight every time. If the enemy team consistently dropped 4 Captains on us at once I would be tempted to rage quit.
---
Don't get me wrong I've been playing since release minus a small break in the game but besides that I've been pretty consistent with trying to learn the raids.
---
why is that?
---
Hollywood undead; for me that reminds me of my Highschool days. Nostalgic for me.
---
Finish the Curse of Osiris, Warmind, and Forsaken Storyline.
---
By then, you'll get a few quest exotic armors/weapons. You'll also be more familiar with the game and mechanics.
---
Youtube some "Datto Destiny 2" videos. 
---
After finishing the forsaken storyline, your next objective should be to grind to max power level (Currently maximum is 750 light). Only activities that give powerful engrams give you light upgrades (The yellow stars on your world map)
---
Although, currently, there's an in-game event currently ongoing. I would take advantage of it and try to get your solstice armor set.
---
You’re a madman if you’re trying to single stack in Gambit
---
Yep had this same conversation a week or so. I'd rather fight a Knight over a Captain any day. Played a Gambit Prime match last week and we all dropped nothing but Captains and a Goblin here or there. They had yet to bank a single mote by the time we pulled our Primeval because of the darkness blast spam from their bank. Felt kinda bad. Kinda.
---
Needs to be temporary ban followed by permanent ban for repeat offenders. They are using macros which is clearly abuse.
---
You could be the shit teammate.
---
I have 130 matches in gambit this season and I don't think I've ever seen someone use Jotun.
---
Finish Red War and you'll get \~3 exotics from it (one weapon, one armor, one random). The armor and weapon ones can be picked for your preference, the random is completely randomized. Exotics are equipment items with special perks. You will also get a free exotic based off of your class when you finish the next two expansions.
---
Also, once you reach the Tangled Shore (Forsaken), do Spider bounties. They give you legendary gear or powerful gear, and have a chance to give you a good exotic shotgun. They also reward enhancement cores, which are incredibly useful in the endgame.
---
Challenges also work for your gear fix, and they usually give good items (faction specific in my knowledge). They are usually pretty easy, like completing a crucible match. 
---
Different weapons have different perks, sometimes randomized. You usually want to aim for ones that enhance damage, reload speed, range, or sometimes target acquisition. 
---
Good luck!
---
Only 3 times? You must have been in a coordinated team then.
---
Love how this is a thing.
---
For console high sens is good because you *can* move faster, precise movements may be harder but they’re still possible. For PC low sens is good because it allows easy precision, and you can move faster by just doing bigger motions.
---
Oh my god...i felt true pain when i saw this
---
Hey I was just wondering if I do the raid and then it reset right can I still get token if I did it again befor another reset
---
It's a pain to be one shotted by it in crucible every match. I respect your decision, but I don't know if others will.
---

YeeHaw: You’re missing my point. I’m not claiming “I already have it I don’t want it”. I’m saying that it’s recycling of weapons. It should be something new not reused. Read the post before you spread stupidity.
---
Move left. Or play by a corner. It’s just surprise that gets most people because it’s easy to dodge. It’s not like a mini truth
---
I T-bag every single one of them when they get killed.
---
Plus Boss kills are going to count!
---
Edit: I think its a good change!
---
Literally all they have to do to fix Gambit is make a "mercenary matchmaking mode"
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Basically, pure pug vs pug. No parties allowed.
---
I think everyone knows by now why people afk.
---
Well shit. I should've known, but I thought just maybe.
---
Literally just had a match where my team mate teabagged me after I died trying to kill a high value target, then he didn't revive me and took the motes.
---
This is great info, was it in the Thursday blog? Thank you!
---
Remember pre nerf spectral how long that lasted we’ll juggernaut is that but also health regen, hammers are basically just as functional as golden gun due to the way maps are built but it has armor and every sentinel tree lasts longer and can block more that middle tree arc
---
Yeah it just came out.
---
Yeah i need to grind a bit more :/
---
When nobody realizes you can use them in reckoning(mirror the bank)
---
I mean if it was his last game or his friend needed the win, why did he help us summon the primeval and waste all that time? Both of the goals you described would benefit from a faster game....
---
Raid loot drops are once per week per character. The weekly reset (Tuesday) is what "week" means, it isn't based on which day during the week you did the raid on.
---
Yes
---
Meme brought to you by Mountaintop Gang
---
You’re argument doesn’t make a lot of sense. For starters hunters are far more mobile. With dodges and smoke grenades and a better jump etc. Middle tree arcstrider also reflects projectiles while sentinel can’t do that. Sentinel is a defensive super whole arcstrider is not. Golden gun has infinite range and hit scan, hammers do not. Spectral blades had wallhacks, invisibility, and much more mobility with R1 spam. What’s Your gamer tag I’m curious about your crucible stats?
---
Imma guess the heavy ammo camper got the heavy and immediately died to thrall. Then he invaded and died instantly again

Assists count towards your streak for a we ran, but don't give points in rumble.
---
I feel this in my soul.
---
I wonder who thought that this would be balanced. Honestly pvo doesn't even feel like a shooter. Wave-Splitter, jotün, non stop meele supers, daybreaker.
---
We stepped to into a war with the cabal ...
---
It’s in quickplay. Lol. This monster cost you that precious coveted 20 extra valor. Very hurtful indeed. Should be banned, computer burned and never alowed to access the internet ever again!
---
Fuck you
---
Oh shit, I didn't think it worked that way in rumble. Ty
---
It always has its just more pronounced when both are equipped. Its the same with mita and the minitool
---
Dang, you're so hostile for no good reason. That can't be healthy. Need to get some medication to help with your salt levels
---
How to profit with Jötunn
---
Step One- Lead your shot if needed or shoot as accurately as possible
---
Step Two-???
---
Step Three-Profit
---
*sad beep noises*
---
I always used to try my best but the mandatory games for the solstice armor have been killing me. I've been using it as an opportunity to get my requirements for hush, so if I was one of the bad team mates that hurt you, I'm sorry.
---
I was in the exact same situasion today, the AFKs are getting out of hand. It's legitmatly quicker to just play 10 games than AFKing 10 games
---
Reports for the whole team
---
That's why I just did gambit prime, faster matches and I didn't have to care at all about how my team did
---
People are still gonna complain thats its not fair that its being made easier after they got the set
---
##[Do my previous game purchases transfer across platforms?](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/CrossSave)
---
No. The things you have purchased from your PC or Console stores will remain on the platforms where you bought them. These includes games or balances of Silver. Cross Save enables you to access the Guardians and Collections on one Active Account from wherever you play. The things that you acquire for your characters in the game are what move with you from one platform to another.
---
Because I liked it? Should I return I won’t have to follow it again. Also I love the memes. Is that a crime your grace?
---
I think I got it once with a Slowva just as I was getting sent home. Got three kills, lobbed Slowva into their spawn, got the fourth, went home, Slowva cleaned out the fresh spawned team.
---
this is gambit prime
---
Play IB when its back. It uses skill based matchmaking so you will be up against people in your skill bracket instead of those guys with 50k pvp kills.
---
Ah, now it makes sense, AFKs are fun
---
It's literally been every single game, I have 4/10 matches done in literal hours because of AFKers and the game timer just ends because nobody can finish it fast enough.
---
Transmat firing!!
---
I like trains
---
Seems pointless given how no one seems to use Hush.
---
With that reaction time? Ha
---
And another 100 hours till you’re 749 then about 1000 hours till you are 750 cause you can’t get that fucking helmet.
---
It’s the only gun I literally hate on this game !
---
Gambit bad
---
Thank you they also have a generalist ghost shell the starter one for destiny 1 and the Sundance shell (cayde-6’s ghost shell)
---
My biggest wish is for a barebones version of quickplay or comp, because I think supers just ruin PVP entirely.
---
For real most times it seems if they invade first and kill a couple of us and my team loses about 20 motes they just give the hell up...
---
Yes but bad rng may mean people who can’t grind 24/7 will never get the gun which is unfair. Raid exotic drop rates need to have a buff or a quest to be more accessible
---
Loved it even more in PvP, that one fateful weekend.
---
I was in a prime match. 
---
3 players on my team were botting, running around and shooting air and jumping. 
---
Other team was 4 blueberries. 
---
I managed to get motes 100-0 alone, by invading and wiping them. 
---
I couldn't manage to get the primeval damaged enough because they'd keep invading and killing the AFKs.... 
---
I had to wait until time ran out and they won by having more damage on their primeval...
---
I feel you..for me its the boots.
---
Yes. Yes, it is.
---
This is like when I did Taken Blight on Io and had a team of 3 people run around killing the grunts while they clearly see me shooting the blight in the sky....and yes this was done while I was grinding Heroic Events &amp; Patrols for the armor sets so can imagine how badly that sucked.
---
At least we ain’t got ornaments no more. Never hit max in d1 because of those fucking things
---
This guy gets it.  Whenever my team gets invaded I look for the person carrying the most motes cause they're usually the one being targeted and sometimes manage to get the invader before they get to them.  Unless y'know that guy is by the damn bank with 2-3 blockers up trying to kill them.
---
Good for you nerd.
---
How?
---
Thank you for the response.
---
Thank you for responding, I just started playing about a month and a half ago so I have been working on the vault triumph. I think I might just be able to get it though.
---
He doesn't visit until Friday reset
---
Oh ok thanks
---
Lol that's gonna be me too that's why I'm not in a clan on PS4.
---
Even in d1 it was still the boots for me, even now my d1 hunter has all 400 gear but 396 boots.
---
Wha-
