Yes I am, made this after reading the latest lore on him. And what I meant was to have a title more about him and less about Dredgen (and said title) although their paths are intertwined.

[removed]
---
I think I saved a clip of it lol
---
Philly over here 100% agree lol
---
Both has zen moments dude.l
---
It could be worse... they could hand the game over to the idiots who let Anthem out into the wild!
---
F.
---
Over 20 times during an Iron banner match... day one small inconveniences
---
The extra range gives more bullet magnetism too, hence more aim assist.
---
Use iron burden to get down to 1 ll
---
Is this done with the same thing people used to use to put guns in armor slots and stuff? Cause I really wanna know how to do that, for fun.
---
I saw my name in the kill feed, but I'll keep trying and checking it
---
Because Vex are the crappiest designed enemies in the game.
---
No, Iâ€™ve reset the game multiple times and am still having this bug.
---
Bruh cus they dummy thicc
---
As far as players can tell, it seems like the *only* activities more likely than any other to give exotics are year 1 raids (year 1 exotics only) and any activity that rewards powerful gear. 
---

---
There's nothing special about gambit or crucible in regards to exotics. The powerful gear challenges for each one appear to have the same chances as any other powerful gear activity in the whole game.
---
He doesnâ€™t have his exotic banner equipped
---
Graviton Forfeit, Oathkeepers, Ophidia Spathe and Orpheus Rig
---
Thorn, Le Monarque and Thunderlord
---
You're Satan aren't you
---
And 1000's running Jotunn. I mean, is there even a logical choice not to run it over fighting lion? I will never ask bungie to nerf a gun. Not ever. But this IB I cleared all seven bounties on all three characters, and all I have to say is FUCK Jotunn. I love that gun like a first born son, and don't want them to touch it's beautiful perfection. But it was putting me into the red.
---
Shin is a Dredgen. Thereâ€™s tons of them. Yor isnâ€™t the only Dredgen
---
Old about decent lol maybe just unlucky ðŸ˜‚
---
and i thought r/destiny2 was more meme-y than r/destinythegame
---
as i said, i couldnâ€™t tell; there are some people who are just taking the piss out of it or genuinely do not know. I try to teach people how to play the game better when i can
---
Damn.! I can smell the sweat from here! Ooof! 
---
(Lol jk jk man, good job!)
---
This got me thinking, what if there was some sort of hoard mode and there was no cap on exotic armor and guns. Have crazy modifiers to keep it somewhat even and not killing the power fantasy.  Probably a stupid idea but still.
---
it only happens to bad people
---
That could be. Every time Iâ€™ve matched an unbroken that team has mercy ruled us.
---
Mean to say idk
---
Yeah I was surprised he didnâ€™t play very well lol I mean I was okay with it but still surprised
---
I was just going to say - this seems like the best way to have that tank configuration actually make sense
---
Donâ€™t worry man Iâ€™m fermented in sweat
---
Buy shit from Spider
---
What would be the best heavy slot non exotic weapon for boss damage?
---
Thank you brother.
---
Looks like you may have clipped the side, and received the fall damage
---
Iâ€™m not literally asking
---
Is that cammycakes alt account?
---
Is that the iron wolf shader?
---
Oh. Lol
---
An aggressive frame grenade launcher. Ideally, you would look for the perks spike grenades (significantly increase direct hit damage) and field prep (increased ammo capacity). [Here is a crowdsourced spreadsheet where people type in damage testing for different guns](https://old.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/ay9yts/weapon_pve_dps_testing_post_patch_220/)
---
That's not Daft Punk. Not even close.
---
Also try Shattered Throne.
---
Me and another Warlock duo'd it with the Grenade Tonics.
---
If you're duoing as Warlocks:
---
Top Tree Voidwalker  &amp; Mid Tree Dawnblade.
---
The Voidwalker kills Vorgeth with 2-3 supers with Tractor Cannon, meanwhile I was making us invincible with healing grenades. Also Voidwalker does insane damage to the final boss.
---
If you're just doing it for Izanagi's Burden, **do it.**
---
Likeness of oryx ( it's still up till weekly reset)
---
That just means you suck at aiming tether. I run it on pretty much anything pve related dont have issues aiming.
---
Boo hoo nobody cares. Also if you barely even play why are you still in this sub?
---
you can blame the people running Luna and ONLY luna for that :/

Black Panther was doing some great striker ground pounds, but it was purple, so....cross class modifications?!

synthoceps?

Just 1000 Burden kills left

2nd was my run. No video.  [https://raid.report/pgcr/3898924973](https://raid.report/pgcr/3898924973)
---
I do it
---
wow
---
Understandable
---
Well good for you :))
---
And thank you for telling me
---
I really hate it when youtube only IDs one of three songs used in the video. I need that first one.
---
Yes
---
All the holding a button to do stuff is annoying enough as is, but this is just taking it to the next level .\_.
---
I had exactly this during a Crucible match. "Good" times.
---
Kill them!!
---
Iâ€™m kind of excited to use a 150rpm handcannon with no bloom or anything, since theyâ€™re pretty bad on console. The only thing I think is dumb is forcing you to body shot to get the bonus damage, but I guess weâ€™ll see considering bungie said they still feel like pinnacle weapons
---
Mountaintop is just the worst, the kills are done long ago, but the multikills and medals take AGES. I don't even know how anyone got it without the Revelry buffs (Lunafaction Empowering Rift + Fighting Lion). They must hate themselves.
---
You basically mugged that guy for ammo.
---
I have a life, a girlfriend and a grandmother that needs taking care of. You might need your 700 gear, but i dont always have the time for you or your needs. 
---
Welcome to the adult life kiddo.
---
Did you teach them a new lesson though?
---
this was a great one tbh. and in case you havent seen it, [this is the root reference](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/aipdw7/the_fact_that_this_guy_thinks_hes_right_lmao/)
---
To be more exact, OP will get 120 putting them at 2150 Glory. Glorious innit?
---
I can see why they do it - having a large amount of their player base be completionists, time gating a whole bunch of triumphs and events ensures player retention, whether the player begrudges it or not, they know theyâ€™ll have to come back and do X, Y and Z in a week or two. For me, Iâ€™m stuck waiting for the next 3 ascendant challenges for the lore and eggs before I can get the dreaming city seal. And god forbid I miss them and have to wait another 6 weeks for them to cycle round. 
---
Iâ€™m still waiting on Jotunn, having it only drop from 2 frames a week is slim and I have two other characters but I really canâ€™t be bothered to unlock access to all 4 forges on them as itâ€™s not exactly a quick thing. I sometimes wish you could get access passes even if they were paid for to cut out all the grind on alt characters. I had to slog through the forsaken campaign to get access to the dreaming city for the seals so having these progression gated areas is an inconvenience at best for alt characters, especially when I donâ€™t have as much time spare as Iâ€™d like. 
---
Hammerhead is amazing, especially in gambit invading and I love the Ringing Nail, having it with dragonfly and rampage - especially as it runs off primary ammo so I could have something like Izanagis burden or arbelest Iâ€™m my primary slot and not constantly be running empty for primary and secondary weapons. 
---
Iâ€™m totally a PVE player as well and I fell about 3 weeks behind the invitation quest but thatâ€™s beginning to look like a blessing in disguise with all the bugs and problems everyone is having with the latest one so hopefully when I get round to it, itâ€™ll be fixed.
---
Waaaaaaait, does that one-shot?
---
Yeah, I remember that one
---
just klick on it?
---
Take it from shaxxx first
---
He's not working hard, he's hardly working.
---
Kinda curious what they actually smell like.
---
I think we all know what Vex Milk smells like...
---
Why not bring something like the *Solstice of Heroes* armor back, which was glowing and looked really awesome.
---
The Revelry armor is just boring generic armor.
---
If I happen upon more I'll throw one your way my friend!
---
Ahh, classic
---
Ps4
---
He definitely earned his overtime check
---
I did not expect it to be real...
---
Reef Knuckles
---
Dude itâ€™s not letting me see the community wtf lol
---
start by paying big bucks.
---
Wait thatâ€™s illegal
---
H...h...how did you run out of fighting lion ammo? You start with like...10 grenades. You just needed one kill...
---
Nice melee kill tho.
---
As someone who plays like 10 hours a week, even the amount of planetary mats and gun parts is mind boggling to me.
---
And then theres bioware making anthem. CTRL + C, CTRL + V.
---
thats every phalanx's shield, ever.
---
taken or not.

This Friday I'm gonna try it with a Forsaken exotic like Ursa. 
---
I already have all the exotics on my Warlock and Hunter so the Titan is the only thing I can test it with.
---
Cayde must have been really small
---
"Surely it's exploded by now"
---
Or im huge
---
So, Warlcoks have a subreddit? Where's the one for Hunters?
---
There is already an Calis bot
---
Ohhh yeah I understand where youâ€™re coming from for the pellet spread part, thanks!

No, I am not, sorry to dissapoint

I do it as a Warlock. As log as you have decent Resilience and a good amount of health and shield, you can survive one, SOMETIMES 2 cursed thrall or Fanatic explosions.
---
How is the spinning chamber?
---
Went to dismantle the blue item but the menu bugged and he dismantled a purple instead.
---
Oh but those don't really bother me. No, it's this creepy bastard just lurking about that gives me the creeps: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftTPFpNv6Dw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftTPFpNv6Dw)
---
My dpi is too high
---
Noooo, i was pretty much sure its stacking up (it seems like an obvious combo, doesnt it? :/). Thanks for writing this. Time to change Neon smt for more interesting ones. Cheers! :)
---
Bungie can we please use the spikes on Riskrunner to melee? And every other bayonet that we have on some various weapons?
---
Pretty please? :&gt;
---
Your good :) have a good one
---
Who said anything about surviving?
---
They are glowing orange balls of explosiveness... GIve me one reason they shouldn't be?))
---
ik :3
---
OP tried to dismantle one of the junk items they'd just grabbed from that chest, stupid UI made them accidentally dismantle one of their raid legendaries instead.
---
It actually spins
---
Damn you I was coming here to say that
---
Huh?
---
This one creeps me out too, just imagine if you were a worker just fixing the Processor, you fell off and this is the thing meeting you underwater.
---
However, is the pellet spread on smoothbore that high that it matters at 9m? Does that mean it wonâ€™t OHK at 8.5/9m?
---
Extra pictures as some of you asked. with a ruler for scale
---

That's awesome, can't wait for my hand cannons
---
Yeah working conditions on those rigs are substandard that's for sure.
---
Not cheap unfortunatly, but they have great quality
---
I know Estonian and this is wrong.
---
Estonian word for cancer is "vÃ¤hk". And "hÃ¤kke" doesn't seem to bear meaning.
---
Still bugged with no ETA on a fix.
---
Smells like mara sovs lady parts
---
Ideal Retold Tale is..
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Range MW
---
Accurized Rounds
---
Slideshot (must have IMO)
---
Snapshot / Full Auto / Rampage (retold = quickdraw)
---
Full Choke or Rifled Barrel
---
Full choke did receive a nerf recently, so my preferred 1hit KO barrel is rifled now.
---
Get kill with ace, reload, switch to recluse and you have buffed recluse (for 5 sec) with buffed ace in back pocket. Ez.
---
Who doesn't love skip grenades. The more the merrier?
---
Glad it's not just me
---
The best part about it is when you want to throw a dagger at them and your character just lunges towards thrall and melee's it.
---
Absolutely not talking from personal experience...
---
I'm a simple man, I see IASiP and I upvote.
---
THIS IS AMAZING!!!
---
You looked death in it's beady eyes and spat in it
---
Who cares when you trigger a full heal anyways.
---
the menu didn't bug, he just deleted the wrong item
---
Thats probably because my Arc Staff does 180% more damage than normal thanks to combination blow^^
---
This is my *shocked face. lol
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
Is there a better software for translation than google translate?  Because if you know 1 I will try it.
---
Hidden feature: If you only have exotics or quest weapons/armor, you get assigned the damaged gear that starts the campaign.
---
SURPRISE!
---
I thought they had already patched the combination blow buff on arc staff
---
The absolute madman.
---
I think we all would.
---
That's the optimal way to do it.
---
Nah it fortunately still works
---
I'm glad OP is happy, but I feel like I dodged a Memento Mori bullet by canceling my order.
---
Honestly, a total waste of my money
---
And the absolute mad lad gets it immediately.
---
Wait that's illegal.
---
Please excuse the panic filled Whisper shots, I didnt wanna mess up ):
---
You have one ?
---
Right! Oooo, or what about a plasma rifle from halo 2?? (Halo 2 is my fav. Halo game so yea... lol) but yea why about a duel wielding plasma rifle and then in the lore they can reference arbiter
---
Hopefully but yeah it won't be until a while so until then... it's gonna be haha time.
---
Avalanche was an event exclusive gun
---
What do you mean he trolls with it, itâ€™s his favourite weapon
---
Stay vigilant. You can do it if I can.
---
Arbalest was actually a good break from the exotic hand cannon monotony
---
I agree, I just want to see more of that in favor of old content in new packaging
---
Feelsbadman... Thx for answering
---
What happened to the BA weekly weapon reset?
---
Hunter Master Race
---
No, it doesn't. It means pickaxe in Norwegian.
---
I guess Guardian would have been the proper term ðŸ˜‚
---
&gt; you can hardly get any full size replica for 50 bucks - especially not an official and highly detailed one; maybe janky, rough 3D Prints.
---
See [here](https://www.etsy.com/listing/683942199/3d-printed-prop-kit-in-the-likeness-of?ga_order=most_relevant&amp;ga_search_type=all&amp;ga_view_type=gallery&amp;ga_search_query=ace+of+spades&amp;ref=sr_gallery-1-4&amp;organic_search_click=1&amp;frs=1&amp;col=1), a full sized Ace of Spades for a whopping 8 bucks more.. Now it may not have all the bangs, scrapes, wear and tear the incredibly tiny one has.. but I'd much prefer the linked version as it's cleaner, obviously bigger for display *and* can be used in cosplay.   
---
Oh plus..: Drum is spinnable and is able to rotate out to reload ammo. Also comes with a slug round of ammo. Will be printed in the four primary colors unless otherwise specified(black, white, silver, grey). Buyer can choose different color scheme if desired. This is a kit of several pieces to assemble by the buyer. This kit will require sandpaper for smoothing if desired as well as some type of super glue or adhesive to assemble. Dimensions of the pistol are 12 x 5.5x 1 inches.   
---
I've had my eye on it for awhile and tbh, I'd rather support an artist than a huge company that *could* have made it much more appealing for a handful of cash more. The assembly part may be a turn away for most, but reviews say it's not at all complicated. Needless to say, I'll be doing the same for [Last Word](https://www.etsy.com/listing/674536044/the-last-word-hand-cannon-prop?ga_order=most_relevant&amp;ga_search_type=all&amp;ga_view_type=gallery&amp;ga_search_query=Last+word&amp;ref=sr_gallery-1-4&amp;organic_search_click=1) (No assembly) and [Thorn](https://www.etsy.com/listing/688372675/thorn-hand-cannon-prop?ref=related-1) (No assembly) as well.   
---
No bashing on the OP, hopefully they enjoy the piece and it came as ordered, unlike some of the other complaints stating theirs definitely did not. In response to those unsatisfied, the above links are wonderful alternatives. :)
---
Iron Banner has always been a week-long event.
---
The Revelry ends next Tuesday. That's been mentioned in more than one TWAB.
---
Honestly I have no idea, itâ€™s a question best left to science
---
Next Tuesday.
---
uh.. what's this and why don't titan's have something like this?
---
Worth the money? Considering a purchase. How long did each candle burn for being my main question.
---
I live for these kind of memes. 
---
Also im so proud of this community. 
---
Grow fat with strength
---
They *literally* mentioned it in the TWAB last week. 
---
Man, do people just not research things anymore?
---
Remember when inviataions of the nine could be completed killing mobs on any planet and that patch you guys did.. undo it? Surely isnâ€™t that simple but I feel it is. Haha
---
It do be like that though
---
How about reposting this image?
---
I took no offense from your comments and I appreciate your input.
---
Good to know. I only ever run bergusia anymore unless a friend or clanmate needs one of the others.
---
This would be absolutely hysterical and I love it. 
---
Overwatch has a mode similar to this where you change characters every time you die. Itâ€™s insane and you really donâ€™t know whatâ€™s going to happen next.
---
This made me snort with laughter.

I still havent tot getaway artist but have had 4 exotic drops this season
