Does anyone know what time the TWAB usually drops?
---
---
---
It's a PvP weapon but I rarely use it in PvP... It's now fixed in my energy slot unless there isn't an add heavy encounter
---
I play like MAYBE 2 hours a day and have a ac unit in the room so it's not central heating and cooling...you just turn it on when using it then turn it off when you're done.
---
Gonna drop at 4:59:59 today as they run for the exit.
---
You know that they have to talk about something substantial this time around or it’s just gonna be gasoline
---
&gt;buffed sidearm damage by 0.01%
---
I think it’s because sudden death is literally mayhem mechanics, and we all know how shards is in mayhem..
---
Oh that makes sense
---
I’ll try that. Still need 200 orbs, 10 precision kills and 3% strike completions.
---
Until they nerf it next week lol 20% damage reduction in PvE
---
That was my reaction lol
---
Right.. I'm lucky to get one kill with my super when I run Dawnblade. I need to git gudder
---
I don't get how a super can be killed that easily, especially by a gun.
---
Don't play with my heart right now
---
Nice
---
agreed
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
RIP skull :(
---
Very nice! This makes me wish I still had time to play
---
It’s expected, I’m just annoyed how about 40% of it was about eververse
---
Exactly.. This took skill (and some luck too but mostly skill)
---
But that’s also expected
---
Vex never apologize.
---
its like they think the massive shit storm they caused with the nothing but nerfs never happened. bungie your coming upon dark times and for the sake of your employees i hope this shit gets better
---
*LAZOR*
---
I personally think so, I enjoy the annual pass too but I would wait on that one
---
I'd actually like to know how many people got killed by it the first time they went to the edz.
---
You know you can cancel your Chaos reach right?
---
I cackled like a mad man when i used triple shotguns and got an army of one. Like why would you let me get that close to all 4 of you AND line up in a row for me? Seein sweet justice like the above clip just shows why i dont stand on the buff the entire time.
---
Hammerhead is usually just way to good to not take for invades. Thing has no concept of range.
---
Appreciate the reference, but I use both actually. Once you the play all the maps enough and know what corners/corridors/open areas you like to play in then you can adjust your load out to the map and how you wanna play it. I used to only use trust and dust rock blues no matter what map, and I would suffer on some drastically. So I adapted, and no I have several load outs with several different armor sets I’ve made specifically for them
---
No need for me doubt my own skill, it’s not hard to tell what’s over powered and what’s not, it doesn’t take a genius
---
Yeah, this isn’t a matter of adapting it’s a matter of a gun being able to outgun any other gun in absurd ranges that fusions should not be able to reach
---
Alright alright alright bot on the field!!!
---
Raise your Hammers boys＼(°o°)／
---
What the deuce?
---
Titans OP, please nerf
---
It rings out like a bell across the entire map, it has an extremely bright animation during it's 3 hour charge time, and it travels at 3 miles an hour.  It's wicked strong to people who can't get kills unless it's an instant kill.  To people who can, it's a waste of a sniper/shotty slot.  In other words, not that strong.  You almost never touch people who are past a certain skill level with a jotunn, no matter your skill.  You can consistently take those people down with other weapons though if you're similar skill. That's what makes a weapon wicked strong.  Consistency.  Jotunn doesn't have consistency.
---
3 miles is 4.83 km
---
Izanagi
---
Yeah, I think a slam should 1-shot low-resilience supers for the amount of super it takes. I think if a golden gun has masterwork armor, they can even survive it lmao
---
This is also a thing on PC, it’s just hot cheeks in general. Neutral game is too saucy to pass up though lol
---
I stopped reading as soon as you said dawnblade was bad lmfao
---
I'm so proud.
---
Honestly I would argue console sniping has a lower skill floor. You can track into a headshot, whereas on PC, people start killing you so fast that you have to be able to snap to heads. Not even to do with aim assist
---
Thanks.
---
*buffs nails modestly*
---
Yeah, I like to amuse myself.
---
I still have my void one from way back when.  I also use my solar Inaugural Address daily.
---
Thanks! I appreciate the info bud
---
Nah fam those morbidly obese Cabal are objectively not it chief.
---
It's medicore.  The blackout scenes are abrupt and a lot of the scenes don't make sense or are completely irrelevant. The Taken King? Why? 
---
I appreciate the monochromatic work with the splashes of colour,  and the music is chosen well,  but the composition of random clips and text screens that are poorly styled just don't cut it for me. 
---
Good effort but lots of room for improvement.
---
This was for Season 4 admist other requirements and rewarded the shader Crucible Solemnity. It's no longer obtainable.
---
Ah, got it. Thanks.
---
Maybe limit it to non team members. That way it's not so gameable, unless you happen to be in a group with someone who just doesn't care.
---
Russian judge gave it a 4.
---
Bruh, he took no damage, stop apologizing for bad programming.
---
It needed a nerd but not as severe as it got. Remove the perk volatility OR slow the rpm, not both.
---
Please respect his culture, he's one sixteenth shark.
---
That is a very Bungie thing to happen.
---
Lol nice
---
I hope it's a pinnacle shotgun and is actually good. Begone days of farming drb in that shitty cave, wanking off the fanatic with his ~~invincibility~~ vulnerability phases and harassing ada for the dreaming city frames.
---
Use enough letters there?
---
Are they all precision shots? Damn. I can never one shot with tataras gaze. I am absolute trash at aiming. Swish skills you've got!
---
I can attest to this. Saw one a while back trying to snipe me from there and I threw a hammer at him. He drops farther down the rock to escape death and goes flying towards me at Mach 5, hits the ground in front of me, and dies instantly. Scared the shit out of me, enough that I was too stunned to react to the Striker coming at me.
---
In English this time, please.
---
2 hours of being helpless and insta super shutdown sure is useless
---
*The Senate
---
I am in favor and have Luna since nearly 7 months.
---
I would have preferred a different nerf but rather this one than none
---
And reluctantly I do agree with your points in this thread more than I care to admit. I just don't want then to mess with stuff.
---
*Emperor Palpatine
---
At least it’s not that xbox one startup thing, whatever the hell that is. The destiny 2 intro music is more than tolerable in comparison
---
Much appreciated thanks! Biggest problem I had is with jumping , after dying on that outside pipes about 30 times I was like 1 meter away from vent that leads inside. We ran out of time then
---
Yeah don't get me wrong I know what I got. The core has been together since King's fall. 
---
I think if they had a clan space, that doubles as a tower space would make it work for everyone. And it would be cool to customize your own space. Tho I have a pretty hefty set up so load times aren't typically too bad for me. But I could see that being a problem too.
---
If you have the season pass, you should still be able to. Or you already did pick it up.
---
If I had to guess, it would be because shards don't give flat super energy, they give a buff that gives faster super regen for a couple secs, and this buff could be multiplicative (i.e. it makes super regen 3x as fast or smth) and that stacks with the increased super regen like in blind well or gambit third round, so you get like 8x faster super on top of 3x faster super, giving you a fuck tons of super back. These numbers are all arbitrary but I think you get the idea.
---
Bungie is all about cosmetics items. The ruling is more about pay to win lootboxs. This guys obviously doesnt even know what he is talking about. If you dont want to buy cosmetics dont buy them it not like it puts you at a disadvantage.
---
"nade"
---
*Zim Zim Alabimm* Thorn has been nerfed - bungie
---
Take my upvote i just laughed out loud and woke up a few people in the hospital waiting room
---
Wait? Crouching hides you from radar??
---
The only triumphs/quests whose progress is reset when the season changes are the ones that *specifically say* so. For example, one of the crucible pinnacle weapons' last steps is "get 5 infamy resets in one season." If you don't do it all in one season, you have to start over.
---
You took to long. Get better.
---
Thank you for the wonderful story. Made me laugh.
---
He/She's so cute &lt;3
---
Are you 10 or something? You literally ask for our opinions. And the reason you are acting this way is you realized your idea was useless and unoriginal but you are too stubborn to admit it.
---
Let me rephrase: only thoughts who see the value in it. Yours isn't welcome. Good day sir. See you in Gambit.
---
Hmm no I generally don't think of that, I'll give it a shot.
---
????? It can
---
That is a stupid justification to not nerf the erentil, like I’ve said twice if it were a shotgun or anything else, you guys would be throwing a FIT
---
So only thoughts who agree with you. Ok.
---
Also did you do the whole strike or just the boss? 2 more spawn before the boss and 2 spawn during. I think if you aren't there for all 4 it doesn't count.
---
I think it really depends on whether you have an ssd for the game. I have a good setup too, but I'm always a bit stingy when it comes to data storage. Not the worst thing to be stingy with when building a pc, but still.
---
Well, I just hope you get your clan space at some point. I just feel like there's more important stuff to make. Consider that placing items around the environment is something that barely exists in the game and would have to be built completely from the ground up. The only thing I can think of is slamming down banners at target circles, roughly at the position where you're standing.
---
Yea I'm not a fan of it. I get killed by plenty of other guns and by no means does it make you automatically good at PvP. 
---
What irks me the most is it's really the only gun I really feel like I earned. Yea some exotics have quests but those are usually fairly simple.  
---
The other issue this brings up - what's the point of grinding for these weapons if in a few months they could be adjusted?
---
I don’t have Luna’s and wanna point out never saw it as needing a nerf. People were just salty about how hard comp can be and the fact they have to use a hand cannon and may not like it, oh well 🤷🏽‍♂️ you want this god tier gun, bungie isn’t just going to hand it to us. I spent probably 3k gunsmith material just to get a half decent roll on erentil so I can just use it when others are. If anything the issue at hand is jotun which can one shot any of my titan super at full health... now that I think we can agree is just not right
---
A+
---
play Gambit prime and see how you like it. also once you learn how to invade properly it add some spice to the gameplay.
---
😂 Thanks.
---
When Season of Drifter first came out, it was good for what it was. Then we learned it was to prepare us for Prime...which is faster paced and most people find it to be more fun, since regular Gambit is a bit of a slog to trudge through. Personally I've stopped going for the weekly drop since it would take too long.
---
Honestly, I'm not sure why they never just "upgraded" to Prime and take out the regular Gambit....I'm sure there are some that find it fun, but I'm with you...it's boring.
---
don't know, haven't tried that yet
---
Didn’t he tell us to get a ship like his that can travel far away to wait out the trouble coming ? Correct me if I’m wrong
---
...I can’t believe anyone would run sweet business
---
This is amazing
---
It can be an extremely frustrating game mode since it requires all teammates to have a clue.  Even PvP is mostly just shoot people, so introducing a sense of necessary strategy other than "shoot person/alien" can hurt.  
---
But yea I find prime matches to be a bit funner and definitely quicker.  I do wish bungie would limit the invades a bit since it can extend games waaay too long.
---
Bungie: oh shit here we go again, NERF!
---
You can really do whatever your heart desires until you reach the soft cap where blue engrams don’t give you gear that’s good. You can do the warming campaign and you’ll level up along the way. Honestly pvp for a person under 50 might be a pain because people are sweating since their nfs are getting nerfed.
---
I'm not a fan of it either. I hate Gambit Prime even more
---
arms are little short
---
\- cry
---
It would most likely not give you progress similar to the way that the Taken/Blighted Essence for Whisper of the Worm wouldn't give you/be acquired before having the Catalyst.
---
The campaign isn't really too hard so you can start it anytime really, but doing some events and even an Escalation Protocol if one is going down will help.
---
Delet boss
---
Whoa, I didn't know that.
---
*BreezyHudson has departed.*
---
in a commentator voice*Xxmom420fucker69xX and his team managed to win a Quickplay match and that raises them on the NoLife Tournament*
---
I really wonder what are they thinking: *Let's find six people to play D2 and play some CASUAL games*
---
When Raids, Custom Matches and COMPETITIVE exist... just why?
---
I totally  understand the nerfs. I don’t have NF but luna is the only gun I’ve used where an  opponent can get the jump on me and I can still out gun them.
---
Why does this ultimate last twice as long as hammers again?
---
Sorry that I'm ignorant, but I don't have season pass. I thought Oryx was killed in D1? And where is this taking place?
---
Launched so fast you open a portal straight into the warp
---
Any time I hear that stupid thing spin up, I just wait around the corner and use my directional hearing to stay out of line of sight until the BRRRT stops.
---
Haha. Are you really so childish? There already are support skills in the game that don't completely neuter your character and make them useless. Who would choose to play as a snowman whose superpower is to force the enemy to put on a jacket?
---
You can already hear the Titan apes beating their chests and loading their shotguns with malicious intent
---
PSA:
---
Always buy the gun and the armor for your class if you do not have them yet before buying the fated engram. Otherwise, there is a chance you will get the gun or armor piece from the fated engram. You can tell if you have an item by looking under the "exotics" tab of Collections in-game.
---
There are two hypotheses about how the fated engram works. The one I am inclined to believe is that Xur's engram will give you one random exotic for the class you buy it on, until you have fully exhausted its loot pool. The other hypothesis is that the fated engram has a 50/50 chance of giving you either a gun or armor piece regardless of whether you have every gun or every armor piece.

Again you miss the f*cking point of the whole damn thing. Instead of writing the whole thing off, build upon it. But no, why build upon when it can be scrapped completely. But that's ok I scrapped it for you. Don't bother building upon the idea. Damn short sighted dunce.
---
1 per account per week.
---
What do you play on?  I still haven't gotten around to getting the catalyst yet.
---
oh
---
It's broken, I have one with hard launch/spike and tested the dmg it did vs other grenade launchers and even after adding both numbers it doesn't do as much dmg per shot.
---
I don't know WHY this is. I tested a couple weeks ago so it might be patched now, but didn't see anyone mention it in patch notes.
---
I've never seen this but then again I never ever use the scatter grenade because it is by far the most useless one
---
 The damage it does is ridiculously low especially in PvP
---
Im having a blast, been back in for a month now and still having fun, Zero hour is really cool and outbreak prime is amazing
---
I’m not seeing him on my map, also my first time
---
Tryna find xur lol any tips?
---
Bungie doesn't go here, fyi. I've never heard anyone say a good thing about these, but the official support forums are were you would post bugs like this,
---
I run away every time and try to get an angle on the invader.
---
It's from night falls my guy
---
Man I thought I'd see some sick sniper shots, turns out it was just a whole buncha kills with a super. Still awesome though
---
It tells you on the bounty to kill the knights first
---
This made me spit out my drink 😂
---
Swarm is broken, for some reason it does less dmg per shot even with spiked than every other grenade launcher. I tested a few weeks ago and haven't rechecked since, but seeing as I didn't see any patch notes claimed to have fixed it I assume this is still the case.
---

Can you point me towards those forums so i can either report this or find an already existing forum?
---
Dude, no one likes your comments.
---
BRRRRRRRRRT
---
Nani?????
---
now
---
You pushed them
---
They pushed back
---
Yes, once this season is over you'll have to reach Fabled again. Your Glory will be reset to zero.
---
You had me in the first half, not gonna lie.
---
Opulence:  great wealth or luxuriousness. A cup is a perfect representation of that.
---
Didn’t know that, at least it’s not a bad roll imo
---
If you don’t like gambit don’t play it. I’m not a fan, never really liked it but I understand the appeal that other players see in it. It’s just not for me, so just don’t play it and then you won’t have to whine about it being boring.
---
I love how long-range and linear this map is. I’m beginning to think it necessitates a change in loadout more than any other map in the game.
---
well we're fucked
---
I mean invading is so easy since you know where everyone is at all times anyways. Sniping just isn't really an interesting clip when there are far nor entertaining ways to invade.
---
What would you like to see people do more of?
---
Yup. The super-restoring normally happens on a delay and never happens that fast without something else increasing it.
---
The meme is less of an attack on jotunn and more of an expression of humorous civil war that is between the fighting lion and jotunn in my friends' group.  Elitism over unique mid-tier weapons.
---
Honestly? Invading with style, messing with people, tricking them into avenues of fire. Things that are more entertaining. The problem with sniping clips is that it's so overdone to the point that it's just really not entertaining anymore.
---
What we really need is some year one weapon love, always happy to see underused weapons getting used. 
---
All in all, variety is nicer than snipetage #8mil
---
Not to mention the powe surge quest that's coming with the next season that gives you 690 gear.
---
You're not alone...happens to me all the time as well...if only Nothing Manacles were back, this wont be a problem...
---
I run sweet business sometimes because fuck the meta.

Groundhog day memes are the best memes.
