---
How to get the repaired version of this armor that actually has good stats?
---
Cut up space suits held together with shower curtain rings.  Please bungie put some time into new armor.
---
Oh okay, now I'm on board lol.

Repost
---
I got it from a strike drop
---
Lmao get fucked. I believe there are only two gods in Destiny. You can only please one
---
I wanna see someone (Baken plz) proc Fourth Time’s the Charm in an invasion
---
So majestic.
---
You don’t have to follow the meta to be good*!
---

---
*when you have the opportunity to fire a scout rifle 5+ times against enemies
---
This post is kind of ridiculous. I haven’t been in a single Crucible match where I had this much time to kill an enemy in AGES, but I can’t ever remember a time where every enemy I encountered was 1v1. As someone who has always loved scout rifles, they’re terrible in PvP right now.
---
Yeah I think austringer feels great and is easier to farm. And 150s are way better for crucible, I just don’t have a good one 150 for the primary slot for pve so really want a nice rampage or swash one, even for pvp.
---
There's different strengths to controller vs. mouse and keyboard sniping and the real benefit to controller sniping is that it allows you to flick shot really well. Flick shots aren't really that effective on mouse and keyboard since without the aim assist you have a much higher skill ceiling. Hardscoping tends to favor mouse and keyboard a bit more too since flinch (especially enhanced unflinching perks) is more manageable. And the final thing is a larger FoV is always wonderful for sniping. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Also if you want a great controller flick shot sniper look for a snapshot/opening shot sole survivor or the like. With the expand head hitbox of opening shot it's extra crispy for flicking.
---
Huh...wish I had that luck. I can't remember the last actual exotic drop I got. Still missing the new headpiece and gauntlets for warlock. Lol
---
Ngl that armor slaps
---
Get yourself a shotgun instead. It’s got a good spreeaad
---
I mean try going up 1 or 2 and once you get used to it keep going up if you like. If you find one sensitivity keep using it
---
I was in the same boat. I can't even remember the last time I had an exotic drop. Its strange. Sucks I got the Lord of the Wolves after the nerf though haha
---
You’ll need 3 people to make it work better so blueberries don’t mess it up. You need to find the canal version of the EAZ. There’s 6 possible outcomes. I recommend just backing out and loading back in until you get cabal. Once you get cabal just play like normal until you get to the boss. You have 2 outcomes from cabal, either 2 bosses, or 3. You need the one with 3 bosses but you don’t know until the boss step so it may take a few tries. Once you get the triple boss, Only kill 2 of them. Leave 1 alive. There will be a message pop up that says something about support for the cabal, and a scion will land. Kill it, and it counts towards the minibosses. You should get a kill on it about ever 45-60 seconds. It still takes a while but it’s quicker than doing individual games

Link to original?
---
Congrats on the first 10 streak. 
---
But this just shows how stupidly easy fist of havoc is to use. So damn broken
---
Ok, thanks for the tips!
---
My former clan leader used to “Sherpa” but instead of teaching people, he would just tell them to hide in a corner.
---
To be more specific, this is an amazing boss DPS option in situations where you have some sort of auto reloading, like a rally barricade or lunafaction boots well/rift. I recommend this to people in raids who are underequipped, since it is a random open drop from year 1 planets, so a lot of people have it. 
---
If it's just you shooting this gun in the open world or something without auto reloading, it is somewhat less good due to the small mag size and need for frequent reloads.
---
But it is... because your bitching about having to buy glows, but you don’t actually have to pay for them so it’s kind of a stupid post
---
Slowly inch your aim up and when you get comfortable again, keep increasing it until you find something that you like
---
Nice
---
Oh I use it for my Titan weirdly enough for things like Menagerie or other PvE stuff.
---
With a flick of the wrist!
---
Yes
---
They dont get extra damage on marked targets, they get a buff after they kill a marked target
---
When armor 2.0 comes out youll already be one step ahead, the glow, enhanced perks and, idk fashion lmao
---
It works exactly the same as every other ornament. You can't "use up" ornaments, you have them forever.
---
Have you seen a dawnblade recently?
---
It’s all great until you get yeeted off the tallest building by a stomp mechanic.
---
Literally and low blast radius grenade launcher with spike grenades and hard launch, wendigo is good if you do the quest, and that's basically it. Machine guns had their damage to bosses nerfed, and while you can get a few linear fusion rifles with box breathing and such grenade launchers with spike grenades are by far better and it's not even close
---
No, you don't get extra damage until after the kill, and it only lasts a few seconds, just like the overshield. Plus it's only a 5% buff and is meaningless on just about every weapon in the game. Furthermore you certainly don't get full health and overshield in less than a second, that's just plain false. Even once the overshield is full you often find that your actual health hasn't gotten farther than half full. If you are going to ask for nerfs, please actually go and learn what is actually going on first. OEM has already been nerfed plenty and the reason you see so many Titans use it is that there aren't very many alternative options and many don't realize that it's really not all it's hyped up to be anymore.
---
If I wanted to go with black and teal, sure. But I just wanted black. I don't know what armor set you're looking at, but that shader has a ton of obvious green. Originally I thought you meant the grenish tint on the regular black armory shader (which I can't not notice when mixed with actual black) but refurbished?? Can't do it. Some parts are straight green.
---
Also, I don't have it, and don't know how. It says "by dismantling a weapon with this shader" but doesn't actually say where to get the weapon. Which isn't very helpful at all.
---
I know that I just don’t know why my warlock got an upgrade to 700 light from 650 but my titan went down to 300 light
---
Thanks man! I hit fabled a day or two after the post though thankfully.
---
I got the catalyst and started using it to work on leveling it up.
---
It's actually an effective weapon--especially during Solstice. I don't even have the catalyst finished yet, but I'm really liking it. 2-3 more bullets would honestly be all it needs imo.
---
k.
---
You only gets it if you completed the set during this event.
---
Agreed it's a poor man's swarm of raven or outrageous fortune tho which can get more perks the key ones being spike nades and field prep but as you said so those not wanting farm for the best it will work.
---
Of all times to appear, why the weekend when I’m on vacation
---
Good meme
---
Have you actually ever used OEM or seen it in action? The extra damage comes from taking damage, IE marked for vengeance.  And the only reason you aren't seeing a full shield and overshield is because you are taking damage as it heals you.  If you 1v1 someone and kill them, you will be at full overshield in less than a second.  The initial nerf was minimal and changed an instant over shield to a slightly slower one.
---
Is anyone else having trouble getting these to register? Mine aren't counting and I can't figure out why for the life of me.
---
Who’s still grinding out the blues/greens
---
Rezzyl wasn't the first, but he was among the first as far as we know. No one knows who was the first for sure.
---
I can't really blame people for AFKing gambit. I always thought it was the worst content in the game and the amount of people afking it really shows how many people feel the same. I just wish they gave us a PvE option for the 10 gambit matches as well.
---
Good job but micro mini for the win
---
I think he’s horny.
---
Lord of wolves was patched
---
They already have
---
If you’re on PlayStation drop your username and I’ll help you get a bit better, can teach you how to play aggressively
---
Bad ass
---
Another good option is the reworked Acantha-D, that drops from the forges. It can roll w/ spike nades, field prep and I believe it’s 5 in the mag.
---
Ah, I see what ya meant now. What light  was your Titan?
---
Slow down  and realize you have time. Some people can be like OP and just get it done super fast.
---
A lot of people will just find themselves burned out if they try to keep up with that pace. You have time--take it easy.
---
I’m also confused.
---
I’m still on green
---
500 soft cap before beating forsaken
---
Is he actually selling the last word?
---
It was her all along.
---
You can say people rely on it too much but I did the crucible grind for the Calus tribute hall for the valor tribute and I wore nothing but Leviathon gear and still got the top of my team almost every match. Bad players are still going to be bad because they don’t know how to take advantage of the marking. I do agree that the overshield is too much though. It can survive a shoulder charge and a lot of other things that shouldn’t be getting stopped by it. 
---
I predict everyone moves to either Dunemarchers, Skullfort, or Feedback Fences when it gets nerfed. There really aren’t that many standout titan exotics for PvP so OEM really stands out.
---
A disgrace to warlocks everywhere. I don't like this strike in general because I've played it so many times during this solstice grind due to it keep popping up but this is rediculous. Can't even imagine how frustrating that must be to get to the final stage and have something like that happen.
---
I have no idea how you drew that from my comment
---
Get one of your friends to log into your account and buy it for you. It’s worth it.
---
this is almost EXACTLY what I picture every time I see the "moons haunted" thread/meme pop up ANYWHERE...
---
Majestic is what I want then. Gotta no life it though to get it done.
---
And again three weeks before that. Everyone who wants it should have it by now.
---
...it’s a quest exotic. It will never be sold by Xur.
---
I just hate PC gamers and their over inflated egos. So any disadvantage that PC gamers get is completely fine with me.
---
Quest exotics will never be sold by Xur.
---
Maybe it was rapid hit then. I have so many different rolls of different handcannons they're hard to keep straight sometimes lol.
---
neat
---
Would you rather go without the radar?
---
Same, not to mention it all looks sick, by far my fav warlock armor(that’s my main) and all the other ones look awesome too, the grind ain’t too bad, especially since there’s still so much time left
---
But there will be other armour 2.0 once the new season begins and probably won’t be as grindy
---
This makes me think of a cop attacking a citizen after yelling’  “Did you just try to grab my weapon?!” Hahaha
---
What graphics card? And switch the ssd for an nvme.
---
"Bank to summon a primeval! You wanna win? That's how"

Keyhead
---
The damage may be more than 5%, but he isn't wrong you know. It's not the hardest thing to outplay. If you shoot him and then he hides for a second, just wait the time out. It's only really good if he gets the kill on the one he marks.
---
Every class has had armor that's rediculous and got hit with nerfs. One eye just wasn't hit as hard as others.
---
Don’t go for redrix.
---
Here’s the quest steps:
---
- Get 200 pulse rifle kills
---
- Get 75 double kills
---
- Get 150 precision pulse rifle kills
---
- Get 50 void kills, 50 solar kills, and 50 arc kills
---
- Play 25 quickplay matches, 25 comp matches, 25 rumble matches
---
- Complete 20 crucible bounties
---
- Reset your Valor tank 5 times
---
So yeah don’t do that
---
Second I saw it I kms
---
I bet he was using one-horned mask.
---
It’s pretty
---

---
I havent even finished my green armor on my Titan, idk how ppl already have done all 3 sets because I get bored doing strikes for the green set...
---
It’s simple. OEM isn’t fun to play against and is only available to one class. It makes that one class far better than any other solely because of the bullshit it can pull with the exotic. Playing with the OEM arguably makes pvp far easier since it gives health and overshield, on top of extra damage. So you get it rolling once and it’s hard to be stopped. Everybody else in the match doesn’t have fun while the titan goes around with regenerating health and shields doing more damage to anything that touches it. One could say that the exotic takes little to no skill to use, you simply take damage and it makes it easier to kill who damaged you. It negates the damage dealer’s advantage of the first shot completely if the titan knows how to fire their weapon in their direction.
---
It may be a boring exotic, but it’s boring because it’s easy and overpowered. We don’t want another game, we want a fun and balanced game. This exotic is not fun. It is also clearly better than any other option out there for the titan, and there is no equivalent or counter for hunters and warlocks. 
---
Also, just because it was nerfed once doesn’t mean it can’t get nerfed again to bring it down to a reasonable level with other exotics. Sure, having other exotics that are useless get buffed would be nice, but that’s far more work than simply nerfing one exotic. I’d rather have this one nerfed now and more time spent buffing others at the moment.
---
There was a post a while ago with the idea that if the story ever played with time travel, they should show the dark ages.
---
Yeah we all are gonna line up to play with “niggawhippa” 
---
Gtfoh
---
I bet your a toxic comp player yes?
---
He’s a try hard comps dildo
---
That mans also got carried through CoS

#Happy cakeday
---
Honestly, I did find it a bit more fun during the time it weren't around.
---
Why the fuck did they kill off the only good character
---
Take all this with a grain of salt, seems shady to me too but if he was a troll it was a pretty damn good one..
---
That moment you complete the armor put on the ornaments and sit next to Eva just to flex on everyone else
---
I'm confused, what is being shown?
---
nope, they can carry my ass if they dont wanna res :) dont bother me one bit.
---
Hey-o! Good job, dude!
---
Just gotta shoot the gun out of the hands of the enemies in the order they appear
---
If you have 15k of it, which is near impossible for 99% of the players. Especially after the tribute hall and such.
---
Only reason I messaged the guy was because he was roaming around the tower with masterworked gear at lvl 100..
---
Same. These people are just insane. Hope he sees some sun now :)
---
Kill clip last like a second or 2 longer but if you use a rampage spec mod they last the same time got two different Duke mk 44 with either perk and prefer rampage I find it's a lot easier to use when fighting groups without having to reload to get the damage increase
---
F
---
Yes, if it's Forsaken including the season pass. Season pass is additional content for the expansion. You would need Forsaken to play anything on the season pass.
---
Good luck
---
Oh I see. Well sorry for giving you spoilers but yeah. That's the sad truth. You must cherish the little time you have left and savour every last memory of him before he inevitably departs. I wish the best for you, fellow guardian.
---
I’ll need it.

Oofity oof emboweled be thou

I don't have annual pass (if it isn't needed to access Xur, tell me how to do it, please) or any of these exotics and after seeing this I'm afraid of going PvP...
---
Cake for everyone
---
Last year’s was a ship
---
That's what just happened to us. I kept saying in local not to kill the third guy and explained why, but he did nothing except shoot at the last boss, so we left as soon as the bosses were dead. If he's not going to help us, we're not going to help him.
---
Congrats man soloing that deserves it's own emblem
---
Since you like pulse rifles, i’d recommend a Blast Furnace from the black armory weapon frames. Look for feeding frenzy/outlaw and kill clip/rampage or you can get a go figure as a random drop from legendary engrams. Look for outlaw with rampage.
---
Yes. Also, celestial nighthawk with bottom tree ginslinger does a lot of damage so that's good too
---
There is no matchmaking because it is an exotic mission that is meant to be completed once. There is no reason to add matchmaking to a mission that should be completed once and then everyone leaves. Matchmaking should/is only available for activities that are repeatable/farmable (such as forges, strikes, crucible, etc.). 
---
Also the 20 minute timer is what makes the activity difficult. If there was no timer the quest would be easy to complete just like the bad juju one. At this point the mission should be a breeze to complete with three people who know the jumping puzzle. You also mention that you are envious of people with whisper which at this point is very easy to solo. 
---
Finally, if you need more people just use the lfg. If you’re on Xbox, the in game lfg has people all the time looking for groups for outbreak. If you’re not, then check out the lfg on Destiny’s site or r/fireteams.
---
Outbreak prime-ikelos shotgun-150rpm spike grenades grenade launcher (outrageous fortune from vanguard engrams/swarm of the raven-from iron banner/courageous surrender). Wendigo is also a good gl but it’s very grindy . I personally run this as well but I do use a grenade launcher in my energy slot from time to time
---
While I do enjoy the game, I agree with you. I have played enough to be established with a solid loadout, and all I see in front of me is grinding out monotonous missions ad nauseam for skill upgrades to do what, grind more?
---
Use all the bs fucking weapons only reason I have recluse is cause of the bs weapons
---
Yeah but what about the pvp playsets who have to play a shit ton of pve to get the armour doesn't that make it not fair for them
---
If you got all these you can't possibly be a real potato at PvP. Not saying you're a player pwning God, but you can't be terrible either.
---
That said, I've been thinking about trying for Recluse. Mostly for the mobility and that it's an SMG. I don't know, though. PvP is not my thing at all, and if I start on it I'd have to finish. Being stuck somewhere along the way sounds like it would be rather frustrating.
---
Honestly the 10 gambit matches isn't even the hardest/annoying part.  :) But as the previous comments mentioned you do have 3 weeks to do them, so even if you are just doing the 3 per week for that powerful hear challenge, you'll find yourself finishing it with less grind. Those EAZ minibosses though...
---
When I get home I'll have a look I can think of a set that might look a bit gothy
---
Damn. Nothing like a paragraph to give someone motivation. That's not sarcasm. Seeing people type out so much shows that it means something to them. Aight. I'll try. Hope you have a heckin good day.
---
If you don't like PvP, just get a Hammerhead or a Truth and invade while playing Gambit. You'll do the 10 matches, too.
---
Long story short: no.
---
A bit longer (Spoilers ahead):
---
Drifter created gambit to train guardians to use the darkness to get stronger so that we can fight the Darkness when it comes. The 9 gave the Drifter the ship he has, encouraged him to keep guardians playing gambit because the triangle looking ships are coming. Not sure what those are yet, but the implication is that they’re connected to the darkness somehow.
---
There’s a bit more lore with The Last Word, the Thorn, and who the man with the golden gun is (Shin Malfur created the golden gun), who Dredgen Yor is (the guardian who created the original Thorn after he was corrupted by the hive on Luna), and how The Dredgens are connected to the darkness and guardians.
---
Ok well then u are SOL because sometimes playing alone can't get u everything in a team game
---
Seems like you've given up without doing much looking at all into how you'd even accomplish it. The event is supposed to last all month. Even if you're trash at pvp you'd still easily hit 75 playing the occasional match and might improve your skills over all.
---
Don't spend too much time in the black commander!
---
Not sure if it's any consolation, but you can also progress this step via gambit. Seeing as how truth is used quite regularly for invading, it will likely add up and potentially finish itself for you if you or invaders are using it :) Good luck guardian!!
---
*Mote Have Been*
---
It was a must
---
You will keep leveling up but if you don’t have forsaken you won’t go past 30. Just whenever you are playing for awhile put on a fire team medallion
---
The medals take too long and as of right now, i'm just going to wait until they fix it. And if they don't, shit happens. I've got all kills done for a while now, which also took an eternity and i'm only at 40% medals. No intention to play any more gambit just for that bow. Wendigo was pretty easy, i just grinded the aphelion's rest lost sector for 4 hours.
---
I think this is a grass is always greener scenario. Arc web can kill three people almost instantaneously. While spectral is hard to shut down, is easier to run from on a Warlock because of a burst glide. Every class has its advantages. If hunters are so broken, play one my dude.
---
You must be rather decent at PvP, but don't you get bad teams often? I've just played 6 rounds and my teammates were all rather terrible. Going in with a pre-made group that does Crucible on the regular makes sense, but random matchmaking? I must be having some bad luck.
---
What would be the underpants ?
---
Hunters are the sheep of Destiny now. Literally look around you. They are a dime a dozen and rely on hiding and running away from every battle. They were more skilled in D1. Notice how every comp season was ruined by mostly Hunter over powered gimmicks and supers. Yet people wanna bitch about nova warp and OEM? I bet my life those whiners are mostly hunters.... Hunters are easy mode for D2. And I used to main them in D1 when they actually took skill.
---
One eyed mask for dudes

Also it might prompt Osiris to come out Mercury and we actually get a some development of his character instead of just some lore weapons

---
It just says "A Random Mod" like Eververse does... I'm wondering what random mods people have gotten.
---
Oh i had bad teams all the fuckin time, i just managed to get enough lucky streaks that got me far enough, im also usually able to hold my own weight plus another person so its not too bad.
---
I appreciate the offer but am on PC. 
---
Gaming with others that do PvP regularly would probably make this a simple gun to get, but rolling the dice on a competent team is just so inconsistent I can't see myself ever getting this thing. At the same time, I don't want to be carried either. I've seen some requests on the companion app asking for ppl to carry them. While I understand just wanting the gun and not the process that goes with it, the idea of being a useless fill-in just for ppl to do the work for me is distasteful. 
---
Still. Wish I could just have it already so I can shoot non-human opponents. I don't even Crucible for the weekly, let alone try for pinnacle weapons.
---
Just doing damage counts toward the objective, you do not need to have the final blow. I was getting around 7 per match because you can take a bow or sniper and hit some from across the map while a teammate does the finishing blow.
---
I don't think it's fun when everyone is running around aimlessly stealing each others motes and not working together. From personal experience if you have a team all running those specific roles you almost always win. 1 person collecting those motes banking 15 one after the other is so much faster then all 4 trying to do it cause theirs so many motes laying around for that person to get.
---
I'm so proud of you OP. I'm trying to get way better at comp but man, it sure ain't easy. You must definitely have a lot of skill and game sense to grind all of those out. Good on you, bud. Lmk if you wanna grind it out on my account. Will pay.
---
Lol, jk. I'm broke af and suck dick at comp
---
Zavala: Whether we wanted to or not, we’ve started petting the adorable cats on mars
---
about 4 hours? don't go for mad frags, go for impact. play the objective and support your teammates, even the ones doing mad flanks. awareness is something which many players lack in lower level PvP, so 2v4s are easy to pull off if timed decently. punish overextending enemies (which there are a LOT of). if you're good, you'll easily come out on top 80% of the time, and you won't bump into good objective-focused players until 2.5k+. 
---
you got this.
---
Right you are sir. They live in lala land. Every stupid comp season was ruined by Hunters on console at least. Arc strider with wormhusk, shards with blades, gwinsin vest with endless spectral. I use Burning Maul and kill anything in my path so I don't care as much about Juggernauts in pvp though in clash they are too much. All they do on console is hop and run left and right while wielding a shotgun because it's the only gun they can win with.
---
Guess I'll just tell myself I REALLY want to play some comp so when it finally happens I can pretend to be surprised. But man, I just went from 260, to 43, to 180, to 60. It's a lot of running in place.
---
No he doesn't he is dead.

Yet look at all the down votes haha pathetic how powerful the truth is. 9/10 main Hunter anymore so I shouldn't be shocked. They are the babies of the 3 anymore. The spoilers brats while warlocks are the mature ones staying quiet putting up with their tantrums sighing in the corner. 😂
---
Probably about 6 hours. 2 small sessions of 2 or 3 games then the best part of an afternoon. I think I got pretty lucky with matchmaking.
---
Insurrection Prime: why do I hear boss music?
---
I appreciate the encouragement. As it is, I'm always doing the objective. If it's straight deathmatch I make sure not to take any unnecessary risks, but man is it frustrating to see others on my team not capturing control points or trying to defuse bombs. I'll just pretend I WANT to play PvP and "forget" I'm torturing myself for this cool gun.
---
&gt; all comes down to player skill. You can evade majority of supers except Blade
---
then you dont face enough warlocks. using blink with the new exotic you can completely negate a bb if youre in the right spot.
---
If you do decide you want any of these guns set your goal to something useful. Like Fabled by September 17th. Then start learning about your class and loadouts and playing a lot. By playing you'll start to learn most importantly about maps and how to fight on each. 
---
With a reasonable goal like 6 weeks it doesn't matter at all if you lose 100 games in row. If your Glory drops from 1200 to 0 next week it doesn't matter in any way if your GOAL is fabled. The 1200 was NOT your goal. What matters is that you learn and improve. 
---
Stop running around corners too.
---
Hol up

Light level advantage is disabled in Crucible m8, that comment just shows how little you play PvP

I can't tell you how many times I died trying to apply it -.- also, with hunters/tractor cannon, hammer strike isn't all that valuable (though peregrine greaves seem nice, shame that I don't have those)

I also use truth, but I’m not gonna post it obviously. 😁

Again nope, I prefer arcstrider

Cool dude. You do you. God forbid people give suggestions to improve the game.

The thing is Ikora dying would have an impact on Cayde not us. If that happened Cayde would have been hunting down Uldren instead of us because there's no way he would sit there and listen to Zavala. Sure, Cayde would take a dark turn hunting her killer but story wise it's better when we get to be the ones putting a bullet in him. I know if Ikora or Zavala died my hunter would still be playing Crucible with Shaxx not hunting down the man who killed Cayde.

Hunter main who hated spectral here.
---
I just want to use guns in a shooter. Pls stop the roaming death machines all classes turn into at some point.
---
ya but were talking about pvp content and not pve. titans are bad in pve yes but striker is practically spectral blades with gwin but not needing an exotic to do it. 
---
heck on the right map a striker can triple wipe a team. even the best spectral couldnt really pull that off without leaving 1 person alive killing them.
---
Thank you
---
Dreg: You underestimate my power!
---
You can buy it with silver or 250 bright dust from Tess.
---
Is that a Scooty-Puff Jr?
---
This post just yes
---
There’s every reason, go play a different game if you don’t like it. You want the reward you do the content.
---
That’s like saying PvP mains should have an alternate way to get raid exotics because they don’t want to Raid.
---
Hah
---
Sometimes I feel like the only thing I can do is supply a melting point so the hunters can shoot off their celestial nighthawks.
---
Titans usually get a lot of shit for things like OEM, but god damn it Titans can be some of the nicest players
---
You literally could not dodge the point harder if you were trying with more vigor than a gassed up chainsaw.
---
What was the quest for redrixes broadsword called?
---
but when it kicks up it blocks your vision way more :v
---
I hardly see dawn blade on console, but I hear it’s used a lot on pc.
---
I don't know about you, but a lot of my friends who quit destiny were raving about how good it would be before it came out.
---
Eye*
---
I could go into all the reasons why preordering is bad for the consumer... you know us... but your too thick headed to understand
---
I use Damietta LR2 in gambit.
---
Stop right there, OEM scum
---
For warlocks its mostly dawnblade. Few run with Palpatine and a few still use nova warp.
---
Correct. I've opened about 80 total packages, and gotten problem ~15 or so different solictice armors with different perks.
---
Yup I’ll be grinding for Luna’s and NF next
---
Lol like hunters are? We have nighthawk and nothing else.
---
They aren't consumables so just change out every time you swap subclasses.
---
On the flip side, dont take an hour to find the miniboss. Some people lollygag in that shit
---
I'm in the same boat, and it still hasn't been fixed.
---
Lol have you tried it while wearing the spite of stars armor? Pure comedy,
---
Very generic
---
I just get raped by jotunn, lord of worlds (it got nerfed but it’s still OP), shoulder charge, OEM, and bottom tree striker every time I go into comp.
---
I meant the triumph wouldnt claim but now i got it
---
Plus this. I’m going to stop comp if I get recluse and revoker. I’m at 1600 glory so I’m kinda close
---
How.Can.I.Get.This.Masterpiece ?!!
---
Just use whatever you think is best to demonstrate.
---
A head shot from old chap isn’t something to scoff at lol
---
Yeah my friend just got done telling me this. He adores his roll. His has full bore , ricochet, rapid hit and multi kill clip, stability masterwork. I also really hate the gun model and the sound it makes.
---
This shit is still hilarious. Months and months and months and now years of Titans being imbalanced on PC and Hunters being imbalanced on consoles with still no balancing in sight.
---
Yeah its an absolute beast. Been trying to get a good drang baroque, got one with nearly max handling. Combined with lucky pants, the weapon swapping is rapid. Drang melts small mobs too. And shielded.
---
Hey I do it all the time, I'm addicted as fuck!
---
Try using Last Word and jumping around a lot. It doesn’t work in every map, but when it works, it works. I’ve been using Last Word, Orwings Maul (for mountaintop progress) and stompies to just frank and jump everywhere. If your a god, you can try the whole slide chaperone with spectral blades. The only problem is you get outgunned by shotguns a lot.
---
***UNLIMITED TICKLE FINGERS***
---
Hunters are way more overpowered on consoles than Titans are on PC. Reddit is full of #pcmasterrace people though.
---
&gt; This capability is provided by a small autonomous drone unit called a Dead Person \[trans. unclear\].   
---
Was already laughing and then that, goddamn it XD
---
Not true, every psion spawns in 30 seconds. You can get 10 of them every 5 minutes, meaning you can be done with it in 50 minutes. Much faster than doing the just doing the events, given you have to damage them for it to count.
---
How would you rate redrix broadsword? I've been questioning to go for it since I recently got a hold of recluse.
---
I *do* have Last Word. Might give it a try.
---
Tnx.
---
I honestly use tether for the abilities. Invisibility on dodge is incredibly useful in raid encounters and stuff, especially if you need to rez a bunch of teammates
---
Delete the game and bnet
---
I had around 1000 bright dust when SoH started. I now have the solar ordainments and the mini sparrow. Just delete your shaders that you never use, exotic ships and sparrows, and do the bounties. Every time you go to the tower, pick up all of the bounties and go do whatever you where going to do. You will get at least a few done.
---
I wasn’t aware that killing bosses fast and getting a higher total is hurtful to others, sorry I’m playing it the way its meant to be played, if people wanna do it fast, do the Engineer cheese, its faster than normal bosses anyway.
---
You can get decent weapons just turning in packages. For instance, there’s a rapid-fire shotgun called Wishbringer that shreds enemies, Better Devils is a consistent hand cannon. If you’re up for the grind, the pinnacle quest guns aside from Revoker are all great for PvE.
---
Did you get one of the leviathan?
---
No we don't need you are good in pve now shut a fuck up
---
I finished it yesterday right before I had to go to work so I haven’t had time in pvp with it. But I ran around pve for about 5 min and it seems interesting. It’s slower than blast furnace until you proc desperado. Then it’s practically an SMG with pulse rifle range and damage
---
Only got a couple today. I plan on putting a tour together. My PC doesn't handle rendering at 4k that well lol.
---
I've been away for a few weeks and I'm not back until Thursday, please tell me this isn't a limited time sparrow.
---
Bro I'm a titan main and I have never even used one-eyed, granted I dont have it yet but even when I do get it from xur when I get the chance I will only use it in comp where it should be. Not all of us are quick play meta users. Some of us go into quick play to have fun, not just to win
---
Dude you're underestimating sidearms, especially this 3 burst archetype. I'm terrible with them in crucible but in pve, they have one of the highest dps for a primary weapon and with damage perks like kill clip, you can clear ads in blazing fast speed.
---
I mean I love hawkmoon, it’s the one HC I’m sad not to see back. However yeah I feel this haha.
---
I would like to see Nova Mortis &amp; Abaddon return.
---
No it doesn’t end 17th of September
---
What happened to the third Dreg? Did they brain blast themselves out of fear?
---
Sword Logic requires that we perfect this nonsense even if it kills us. xD
---
Yes Gambit Prime counts but the elemental orbs don't drop in gambit prime.
---
Hmm well I guess in August
---
Old crucible formula was better, special was more rare, supers weren't as long, you actually relied on SHOCKER your guns... Your actual skill carried you.
---
I got the game when it was ps plus free so do i get that?
---
The good news is, you can just grab a planetary resource bounty to satisfy those requirements. Those don't take very long at all.
---
Arc
---
That's a bummer, but at least those aren't exclusive to Gambit and can be farmed while doing the other stuff
---
U have no right to exist if you use OEM
---
How is it on PC? I might switch over soon.
---
I'm giving you permission to flip those numbers and never look back...unless it's to check how badass you still are.
---
That would be true if him taking the light wouldn't have awoken the Traveler. I feel if he just took the light from the beginning the Traveler would have simply awoken sooner and stopped them itself.
---
Yes gambit prime counts
---
Sweet!! Thanks!
---
Yes August 27th
---
Yeah, thankfully. At least there wasn't an objective like getting 1500 elemental orbs in gambit.
---
What’s wrong with hand cannons?
---
Do you have the source?
---
how do u get it?
---
Need those strike arc kills!!
---
Still a better love story than twilight
---
Shhhhhhh, Bungo might be in the comments. Don't wanna give them anymore outrageous quest step ideas, the fuckers
---
Big signal boost to you, mate. The Destiny 2 LFG is awesome. Literally full of the nicest and coolest people.
---
Sounds like you've yee'd your last haw.
---
Moons haunted.
---
Ooh piece of candy
---
Hey, I never said I’m good lol
---
Ok so it doesn't appear indefinitely each time I make a new character, cheers for the headache avoidance m8
---
If yiu already have the game then the annual pass is $15
---
Chode sparrow
---
Whats the Problem with using a webforum to find Clans? In every other MMO i found my Clan/guild in the Forum. And i found my best online Friends in destiny 2 (we Play a Ton of Games together since)
---
They said that is what kind of buffs we should expect but it was just an example. So probably shouldnt get your hopes up because that buff would make titans even more useless in pve
---
Never ask for downvotes or continued downvoting that just makes it worse.
---

---
Cammy is good. There are people people who are better than him but he is one of the best. If he was “above average” then I would’ve been able to 1v1 him and say it was a fair match.
---
I don’t need it....I don’t need it.....
---
I don’t it....
---
I nnneeeeeeeedddd iiiiiittttt!!!!!
---
Only things that bothers me about the mini sparrow is that is still has a normal sparrow hitbox...
---
\*whispering\* Oh crap! sorry, quick, cover up the evidence!
---
You are very wrong he is a titan it automatically makes him level 1
---
Hey, at least I give people joy unlike you where you are nothing but insensitive.
---
New monarchy scout rifle I believe. No longer obtainable
---
Can I just have serious replies.
---
May I have a copy as well? Got some good ideas for this bad boy
---
Yep. It’s a shame that I like the short blue ornament better.
---
You also got to realize that this poster also posted a post called “CoO is better than Black Armory.”
---
No, this isnt a serious subject.  I save that for shit that matters. Lighten up dude, lifes too short to be so uptight
---
Oh sorry, missread
---
True. But I kinda want meaningful arguments.
---
I think you may be right
---
Quality upvote material
---
&lt;3

Apollo-Loyal-to-Datto
---
I saw one aswell today and It was also on IO XD. It was a blue mini.
---
These things are great, if you do a jump and use your down arrow on PC you literally t pose mid air
---
Doe the ornament actually make a difference?
---
I haven’t tested it on polaris lance, but the ornament makes a noticeable difference on Chaperone so it would stand to reason it would work on Polaris Lance
---
Sorry, my bad, I love put those things everywhere
