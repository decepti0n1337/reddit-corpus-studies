Swords are pretty lit when the enemy team is dumb enough to be grouped up close and with little room to manoeuvre. You can go through them like a blender.  Only issue is getting close.
---
---
---
Needs more context. How do you mean how do you do the bounties? As in his graphic there? Or are you specifically asking how do you do bounties? Asking a legitimate question so we can clear up the confusion here.
---
They still have yet to fix the chalice from last season
---
Doesn't matter if I take a break if the game puts me against 3 stacks all the time. I mean, it's not even close
---
did you directly launch Savathun's song/Will of the Thousands strikes from Titan/Mars?
---
Spawn into game, immediately lose.
---
Man I'll never love any one hit kill in video games.
---
Can't do that with bottom tree striker..... Titan haters heads will explode
---
The first story mission on Io, called Sacrilege, you can choose it from 3 guns as a reward from Asher Mir.  Otherwise it‚Äôs just a random drop.
---
Is that crimson I see
---
Its okay. Others get glory, but they stand upon our shoulders. Our rifts are indispensable
---
How did you finish it I can‚Äôt get the key mold to drop

You can't have fireteams in Freelance though so you can't get a 3 stack

"This isn't over until Shaxx sings, and he's shy"
---
Nice
---
Ahh ok, thanks for the clarification. Back to grinding out strikes.
---
This game is literally played by 13 year olds lol
---
No I only have played control so far. I'm more want to do  pve stuff on destiny 2 anyway because I already play Overwatch which is enough competitive stress in my life. But yeah I feel the matchmaking feels pretty fair. I did play some Destiny 1 and am I religious Halo fan so it's not like I'm unused to arena shooters.
---
Looks like the rifleman took snipers Sydney sleeper.
---
Most powerful guardian
---
Thiccachu
---
You need better fiends.
---
Why use wormgods caress when you can one bang already feelsbadman.
---
How do you even get this low now that everything is 750 light?
---
What build is that? 
---
(Not like imma use it or anything hehe....)
---
I really want it to go division on us and let there be dark guardians that we can play as :D
---
Red Legion is simply a legion of cabal. Just like the Skyburners or Siege Dancers
---
I recently came back to the game after about a year break and IMO it‚Äôs never been better, it seems like they finally really got everything to just ‚Äúclick‚Äù and I feel like they will release content regularly enough to keep just about everyone happy.  There‚Äôs always exceptions though
---
hi! thanks for answering. ive completed the bountis like a one week ago.
---
This is why I hate titans ...because it's like playing destiny2  but on easy mode.
---
Do vex invasion, iron banner, or survival for legendaries
---
You, i don't like your flair
---
Already did 
---
Kinda feel bad that we turned our back in everyone who‚Äôs been kind to us.
---
Oh if you mean the Edit I fixed the auto correct error
---
What did you use?
---
Ohhhhh ok that‚Äôs odd I don‚Äôt know then, good luck though!
---
Party up
---
Any of the 180s. Trust is decent, service revolver is quite nice and optative is damn good as well.
---
Trust comes from gambit
---
Service revolver from vanguard tokens
---
Optative from vex offensive
---
those are rookie numbers
---
May we weld the ace of Spades in remembrance of him
---
Honestly, he makes my day way better. After a long day of work, i love killing some guardians in crucible and hearing Shaxx encourage me all that time makes it all better.
---
Count me in.
---
snapshot w/ full stability rounds/barrel. I wouldn't mind getting a stability/unflinching/stability perk one though
---
Took you that long to kill him though lol...if he had striker on he would have hit you easily with a shoulder charge. Just saying
---
When the grenade throws you
---
You are not doing it wrong.
---
There is a chance to obtain a rare bounty everytime you complete and turn in a bounty Ada. 
---
You don‚Äôt need to turn in all at once for a higher chance. It‚Äôs a rare bounty, that‚Äôs why.
---
I farmed 4 weeks of bounties for my first rare bounty
---
I have the same problem. I buy the extra bounties from Vanguard and Shax to get Bright dust. It‚Äôs any easy way to knock off $3k for each one
---
I just came back to the game a week ago... I'm sitting around 910... Constantly getting 1 shotted by 960 players (or higher) in IB... This isn't an event. It's more like a lesson in extreme patience for me...
---
Then I find out, that my IB tokens, hard earned from a slew of losing matches, can't even be turned in until I finish Scour the rust... Fucken amazing.
---
You should rename yourself Muhammad Ali
---
Ye, me too, got 4 yesterday and 2 today. Now sure why 2 reset like that.
---
Yes you can still get those
---
honestly if I could go back too the launch of rise of iron I would by far my favorite destiny dlc out of both destiny games
---
Brb hiding lightbulbs from the spoopy boys.
---
I've seen scrota and I'm friends with options
---
Did he tell you to stop killing him, in a pvp mode?
---
Bruh
---
r/destinyusernames
---
I feel better for choosing the drifter already.
---
Yes. But they ate quite the quest.
---
Hi yes I will take all the falln please and thank.
---
You‚Äôre right! I misread the info graphic
---
To Legend rank in comp we go!
---
thx :(
---
Such a cool skill tree, makes you feel like an electric space wizzard!
---
Maybe but if they do they will be pale as hell as they will have to never see the light of day
---
Those three are tied into quests. I‚Äôm not sure if they are part of the free to play version of destiny. In fact I am almost certain you have to buy forsaken in order to get those specific exotics.
---
Damn!
---
Had a very similar strat in d1. Called it straight line man. He runs in straight lines
---
Hell yea! I tryed it and its so much fun! But I usualy fail in timing of actifating super fast enought to save me :D
---
Yes
---
Thank you. I appreciate it.
---
Haha yeah
---
That's Saladins hype style. The Wet Blanket approach
---
I use the moon one, it‚Äôs the best in terms of dps but if I come up against a recluse With it I‚Äôm dead everytime üòÇ as I said I‚Äôve already done the quest and this is my second go so I‚Äôm not that bothered but I can imagine someone who isn‚Äôt that great at iron banner (struggles with normal crucible) would get ridiculous annoyed and it upset depending on their age at being tunnelled into a certain play style. It would be fine if they did it with damage so 1000 damage with smg‚Äôs say as that would make it so that even if they die they can still progress.
---
Does the melee range buff with Synthocepts stack with Knockout? I didn't think that they did
---
This reminds me a bit of tribes without the glides.
---
I think it was around +4 or 5 but i didn't pay that much attention.
---
Big Garfield
---
Ikora. She blew up half of Chicago in the process, and broke off one of his horns
---
I get purple lens flares from my engines even when my ship isn't currently showing in orbit.
---
Hey that guy is in my clan! :)
---
You don‚Äôt need to do that one mate, only the armour quests. The weapon ones don‚Äôt progress Shadowkeep
---
*NNNNNNNNwhy not* (also rubs your nipples)
---
Fuck when is iron banner. I need my skins back from Destiny 1 for my hunter
---
I thought I did and didn't see it. Did I miss it?
---
I saw only the kill feed, I'll re-check.
---
It also said in its hidden stats (when I right clicked on it through inventory) that I get +10% EXP in crucible. Do I need to activate it somehow or it's a passive? And exp for what? Season pass?
---
Destiny 2 support group please
---
I mean it's pretty good
---
Glad I don't play a game where something like this is even possible.
---
You fight your best with someone in your corner
---
I got in a lobby with Eris Morn‚Äôs PP Juice yesterday
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
&gt;‚ÄùWhat dumb sonuvabitch cast THAT?‚Äù
---
The cabal should be called the cabob
---
Oh ok thanks I was thinking it‚Äôs a bug
---
You can just reaquire old or quest legendaries with fixed rolls. There is a new light player guide pinned in this sub with a god roll document.
---
You can use this as a reference for your weapons. 
---
Please keep in mind that just because a weapon doesn‚Äôt have the ‚Äûgod rolls‚Äú, does not mean you have to dismantle them. If you still feel comfortable with a weapon just hold it.
---
Besides that there are a lot of good destiny streamer and youtuber. Check them for ‚Äûmeta weapons‚Äú you should consider to farm. 
---
There are a lot of main perks on some type of weapons that you always want to have. There are many guides on here or YouTube. Just read/watch them and you will soon be able to determine if a weapon is considered as good or trash.
---
Worth mentioning I never did prestige of either as I saw no point so I don‚Äôt have any to test. If they were universal I would do some prestige EOWs
---
Oh ok so 5% of the wins progress, thanks
---
You can only reacquire gear that you got pre-Forsaken or that have fixed rolls. Random stuff that drops from legendaries nowadays can't be reacquired.
---
Titans are gay
---
Damage from BE and knockout stack, the lunge distance does not stack.
---
Who has time to drop rifts when you're abusing the hecc out of astrocyte verse and bottom tree void Walker.
---
I saw flawless in the title, disappointed it was not trials
---
This guy gets it
---
Pretty sure Shaxx is just our subconscious when we are on the battlefield trying to kill each other.
---
Why i stopped playing
---
I got 4 or 5 rapid kills and he said "TELL THEM TO LINE UP FASTER" Lmao I was dead.
---
Ha fought against him, in iron banner got my ass kicked.
---
No but I did end up playing a bunch of different strikes to figure out why it wouldn‚Äôt work, but I just picked up other bounties instead. Still got my powerful gear
---
Nice cut. It got me good.
---
This is a strange question but, what's the point in getting and leveling new guns? It's not like you can use them for good as there is always a higher light level, when I get a level 930 shotgun I still can't invest anything into it because I know right around the corner is a level 934, and my upgrade modules shouldn't just be wasted
---
Thank you dude for the explaining
---
Guess you haven't played in PvP with someone with 20 gun icons as there name taking up a massive amount of screen space
---
Woops. Had fusion rifle in mind. 
---
Yeah you are right. 3 more to go
---
Awe, you gonna cry warlock ? üò≠üòà 
---
Ha! Titan master race mf!! üòàüòàüò§
---
One eyed has been a problem for atleast half a year, hopefully they'll get it right.  
---
It'd be a shame if it stayed like this.
---
Eh, I see IB as a limited time event where everyone just says "why not" and brings their sweatiest loadouts. It's kinda fun.
---
Now, I don't like getting bodied by 6 stacks either, just quit and find another match, there's no penalty.
---
Good question...
---
Really? Wow that means they worded that wrong or they programmed it wrong. It says get kills with the explosion.
---
So if i where to get 8 to 16 more GB of RAM I would be totally fine?
---
This expansion had a ton of under the hood changes and changes to the general flow and progression of the game.  I agree that‚Äôs light on new exotics, and the main quest is definitely too short, but it feels like a different game to me now, in a good way
---
In Russian cosmodrome, grenade throw YOU
---
Pm me
---
Oh we are :')
---
If the only thing in this entire game that matters to you is exotics and 9 of them in one season isn‚Äôt good enough for you, then you‚Äôre welcome to leave
---
You shouldn't claim it until your gear is 950 because only pinnacle stuff levels gear after 950
---
*truth
---
Yeah I had the same issue with a lots of games. And my setup is worse. Just running GTX1060 and 8GB RAM
---
When I upgraded to 16GB most my issues where gone.
---
To be fair not every single one but I can smoothly play any activities by now
---
He literally posted it to this sub
---
Comment to help push the post?
---
This happens a lot. There is actually a way to force this to happen that people do quite often. I don‚Äôt remember all the details but you can look it up if you‚Äôd like. I believe it‚Äôs referred to as ‚Äúwin trading‚Äù and involves teams backing out right when it finds all 6 people or something like that.
---
Liek blue floaty meth, tumor falln, Michael Jackson thriller obsession, dont freaking die, has hepatitis r squared, who you callin' fork head, ruled by king fork head and his boys.
---
no, do it again
---
I love when he just starts laughing non stop
---
You cant get warlock armour if hoy are playing as a titan (lol?)
---
I'm playing as a warlock
---
mountaintop, curated threatlevel, revoker, new moon shotty maybe? exotics are up to you
---
And have gotten 8 titan drops
---
Never knew, but at no point did anyone show up in the roster so my friends and I think it's was just a matchmaking mistake.
---
That particular reward is the same at the end of the moon story. Each class gets their respective new exotic.
---
Yes they are
---
Do it for science
---
And both of them are right
---
I can only confirm that‚Äôs what I got.
---
Definitely just some kind of bug. All weapons and armor have been raised to 750. Wasn‚Äôt even possible to have a 0 power item before Shadowkeep.
---
You can get back to that area when you do the Riskrunner catalyst quest.
---
it's been that way since forever
---
One of my old colleagues said don't trust nobody not even yourself.
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt like them either. One eye titans? Bring disgrace to our class.
---
F
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt entirely know how people do it on purpose but it‚Äôs some kind of matchmaking manipulation. I think it‚Äôs what people actually pay for when they pay to get crucible ranks/weapons. I used to think they just payed someone who was really good to carry them but they just do this thing a lot for free wins until they get the gun or rank they want.
---
They are now in a daily playlist on the EDZ map.
---
I got the same. Looks a neon fish net.
---
Vex offensive goes away after this season, so I think they‚Äôve made it very farmable.
---
 Nice move...
---
Thank you, I‚Äôm going to consider it some more before I jump. I haven‚Äôt played in more than a year, was hoping everything came all in one so I can play everything.
---
Yeah I‚Äôll complain all I want when it comes to being forced to use shit weapons against recluse and mountain spammers but nice try üëçüèª
---
It's stuff of myth youre schooling for
---
Yes I do
---
Treasure Hunter is nice and it looks pretty cool, but Banshee's favourite is useless in my opinion. Personally I only use ghosts with the Guiding Light perk for the sweet, sweet 10% xp boost, but to each his own.
---
My fireteam would literally yell at me everytime we hit orbit... I lived for that
---
Literally described it today as "you remember Sebulba?"
---
Why did you expect them to change this one if they didn't the previous 6?  
---
Also the previous 6...was activision not still a part of it then? Not really a fair comparison you galloping thundercunt.
---
No. It is randomly rolled so you can‚Äôt unfortunately. Also iron banner ends on Tuesday.
---
Thanks :D
---
Travellers chosen is actually pretty op but all these meta hug fags dont care all they really want is a nice little one tap with no skill required
---
I asked a fucking question, said I disliked Pulses which is fair against insta kill recluse and OEM spam. I don‚Äôt give a fuck what you think is moaning, try downvoting and moving on instead of leaving a useless comment cause all I ask was how many steps not ‚ÄúWHY SO MANY‚Äù.
---
I just got the thunderlord at the end of an iron banner match, fate smiled upon me today.
---
Its user error dude, gun is super strong
---
well......i liked my other guns so thout i should desmantle it to get something good and it gave me 3 scrap i feel dumb.
---
is it the same armor as the previous years?
---
I was using both parcel of stardust and imperial decree in crucible. It feels like their range have been dropped substantially
---
If only that was a sniper.
---
The thing about yhe gun is that it does more damage the longer you shoot at an enemy. It's a pea shooter at first, but after a couple burst it melts that yellow bar like butter.
---
Good job. Enjoy your new space ship. I never switch it out anymore.
---
i mean , are u griding the armor for ur 3 chars ?
---
It's a playlist now at the bottom left of the EDZ map.
---
Most people have either done it by now, don‚Äôt plan to do it or don‚Äôt know it exists really.
---
I hereby formally request that if possible, you change your in game name to "Punchy Mcfistman"
---
Haven't gotten mine yet, but IB has been wonders for medals earned.
---
Havent seen a single one of these which made me even giggle, they just seem gringe to me :/
---
I can see a PVE buff but in PVP it's pretty decent. It acts like almost any other pulse but it you get em low enough and the nanites prime they clean em up
---
I was literally just playing Iron Banner with Who You Calling Panhead haha
---
Wow that looks amazing, but I'm jelly as I can't get Dunemarchers to drop :C
---
I can help out if you play on Playstation.
---
Thank you! Also I don‚Äôt think I ever will anymore ahaha
---
Control and IB won‚Äôt match well. And depending on the traffic of your tier of players you might end up facing mightier opponents 80% of the time. Just keep swimming, or swinging if you a titan
---
I just need 2 runs that's it
---
PVE crucible event. 8 Man team versus one overpowered AI Shaxx. He only uses his fists, gets super damage reduction, and has unlimited charged melees. I'd be down.
---
I hop into a solo nightfall whenever I need to do bounties lol.
---
I ran into someone called "Gold-Plated Nutsack" on the day shadowkeep released lmao
---
Do all your powerful rewards for the week then grab pinnacle when you think you're ready. I'm not turning in my Iron Banana bounties until I'm closer to 950 base power.
---
Hey, I saw OPTIONS OPTIONS OPTIONS OPTIONS OPTIONS OPTIONS OPTIONS OPTIONS in the tower the other day.
---
Try going to orbit
---
I guess you mean suppers. Those give the player like x2 or x3 health, special abilities to kill and a void arc or sun aura.
---
Or maybe you are talking about riskrunner. That is just to show that its perk is active, but you can still kill them
---
Are there any physical books?
---
These Steam names are getting out of *hand*
---
By all means then give up
---
Yea cayde is looking up who beat shaxx, and he finds ikora's win, then proceeds to lie about his beautiful pants
---
What is 'pine' short for that warrants censoring anyway?
---
I smoke that drifter pipe ya feel ;)
---
Thank you.
---
I got it they weren‚Äôt counting for a few games
---
The multikills can be finished with any weapon you only have to use the scout rifles for the top percent bar.
---
Tried relogging?
---
I got that same exotic shell yesterday, but I was happy since it FINALLY finished the fucking drang quest.
---
Trip mine kill in destiny 2, now that's fucking rare
---
Middle tree nova bomb, lets you charge your grenade and throw out a shotgun blast-like spread of void pellets and if like 4 out of the 7 launched hit someone they‚Äôll die
---
And that's the main reason I stopped using rockets and solely use LMGs.
---
I played with shiny titan for like 5 matches today.. small world
---
How did you guys choose who go to be exodia ?
---
But, it's fun...
---
It's all coming together
---
I mean sure, but even so from a game balance perspective it‚Äôs incredibly strong, people just downvote anyone who says hunters are good
---
"Caballs deep in Eris Morn" is a personal favorite.
---
what do you expect of a Team focused / favored PvP activity? ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø that's what Survival: Freelance is for.... but yes, i would like every PvP mode to ahve the Freelance Option.
---
Well the guy who came up with the idea to do this got to be exodia!
---
nice flex on doing the raid lol
---
I use it in PvP god knows why. But the only particularly good use it has is that the explosive part of the bullet deals the same damage no matter the distance. See a guardian on the other side of the map with 20hp? No problem. Skyburner will deal that no matter where
---
whats going on?
---
how do you get text like this?
---
The sword logic stands no chance against the Thot logic
---
Peregrine greeeeeaves. Made me chuckle for some reason
---
Oh I do have one with feeding frenzy kill clip and accurized
---
So that‚Äôs what it does! I got one a long time ago and never knew what it was
---
im always using OEM bottontree striker LW erentill. You better step up your game and git gud scrub :D
---
Rip me lmfao. I‚Äôll just wait till the last forge is out again try maximum temper that and see if it drops on that. Will see lol
---
Inertia override?
---
Damn, this sub has been thirsty lately.
---
I mean its not another handcannon
---
They did, I've got the same issue. Recent season's ships don't come with a transmat effect on, old one's drop (and still do this season) with one in the socket.
---
The only thing Tess should sell are emotes, transmat effects and ornaments. 
---
Ghosts, ships, sparrows and especially gear should be earned in the game!
---
But seeing how greedy games got in the last years, I'm happy bungie doesn't go full EA or Avtivision...
---
thanks. yeah i finished it as well by only using SMG.
---
[https://www.pcinvasion.com/destiny-2-shadowkeep-getting-to-950-power-level-during-week-2/](https://www.pcinvasion.com/destiny-2-shadowkeep-getting-to-950-power-level-during-week-2/) alright
---
I‚Äôve got a code you can use. The only thing i‚Äôd like in return is the code for the emblem you Get from it
---
contraverse hold + handheld supernova for easy mode
---
Scourne approaching
---
I kinda crutch on austringer and beloved.. I find recluse fairly difficult to use so I don't use it much. Pluperfect and gunoras axe are also really easy for t me to use. I don't know why but a lot of the usual crutches just don't work well for me
---
Hi, this is a dumb question, but how do you change your username in D2? do you have to change your username on steam?
---
May I introduce to you young ahamkara spine?
---
Iirc both count, my friend was adamant he did it with Mountaintop and honestly I believe him. Getting SMG kills against people with 960 light level is ridiculously hard without a proc'd Recluse. You do booty damage.
---
If you can‚Äôt beat em, join em
---
Ib ornaments work on every new Ib set. New in the sense of S7/S1+
---
Yeah consume one when you do a forge frame and voila. Theres
---
Your armor. Bit annoying we can only carry one at a time
---
Absurd.
---
I run collecter with transversives specifically to yoink motes from that one guy who always picks up the 2 extra ones you need.
---
I'm personally not a big fan of double primary loadouts (auto rifle / smg). for my last crown of sorrow run I used Recluse and Parcel of Stardust. I'm just feeling better, when I can get fast damage output with a sniper rifle or a shotgun against bigger enemies
---
because its f2p
---
&gt; Using low skill weapons like shotgun
---
&gt; true guardian
---
Pick one.
---
Noice
---
Indeed
---
Bonty DO
---
Guardians can change subclasses at will, But Zavala for some reason uses Striker most of the time
---
I would do want to play as a fallen
---
Right, but that isn‚Äôt funny. 
---
So there must be something else, surely. What am I missing?
---
You ready to bang knuckles?
---
To destroy the forbidden one, you must first kill his sentient limbs and balls
---
Dafuq?
---
didnt know either altough i know why i am always throwing the nade first and the knive second, bc of the ahamkara spine exo perk, when i throw my nade i have 0 on my grenade cooldown and every abbility hit gives you around 33% of your granade energy back, soo if I threw the knive first im loosing free grenade energy. In this clip i had stompies but the spine is always in the back of my head
---
Yea seems to be a loading issue :( if I equip another shader it magically shows up again. Weird!
---
Iono, maybe he thinks its funny? I can think its because steam has "install now" on any F2P or "Play Game" when its f2p before install.
---
thats easy math guardian
---
idk the warlock one, but i do know titans can oneshot grenade aswell.
---
I am sorry. I forgot to add the /s.
---
I came across ‚ÄúCrowota, son of Oworyx‚Äù. Absolute legend
---
Absolute 10/10 banter...
---
Unless your in a corridor with a Striker
---
*Vietnam flashbacks intensify*
---
Worth a shot.
---
Now that's one thicc boi
---
So hot!
---
I played a round survival with another random dude vs three, he carried me about half the match before my PC crashed. I was so sad I couldnt help him win. The name were some random (i assume) symbols. If you are reading this and you might be this guy: I'm sorry.
---
Hollowed lair nightfall
---
Someone did this like 10mins before already?
---
It's the secret emblem found on moon I think
---
Happened to me last week, only got the phantasmal core
---
How do you get that "Warlock" behind your name. That is amazing
---
You might be getting the wrong points
---
Oh ho ho I bet you can take it different ways ;)
---
I only hope that some day Bungie will finally stop making quests/bounties which require using specific weapon types.
---
To do the main mission like the campaign i believe you need to go to Amanda in the tower and she will give you the start of the red war campaign
---
Speak to all the vendors on the Tower to get familiarised with who they are, once you speak to someone called Amanda Holiday, she will give you the option to choose to play the Red War, Curse of Osiris, Warmind campaigns. These will be highlighted on the map and linear based through A-Z
---
All I got was glimmer üòï
---
r/fireteams
---
At the tower go to the right and there is someone which will give you history quest, sorry I don't remember the name correctly but imo it's ADA-11
---
Good rolls on various weapons, the raid, Randys, I also haven't finished Wendigo as well as Hush. 
---
I'm one item away from wayfarer and 2 away from cursebreaker. 
---
I also want to help my friends reach Fabled on their way to Recluse. 
---
Sooo, yes - will be a busy season.
---
Yeah 17th of Oct and im still having the same problem
---
I'm not a titan but recently got recluse so I sure as hell will use it and I'm having a lot of fun with it. Still enjoy my curated Kindled Orchid more tho. Everyone sleeps on that wepon and trash it but it's super nasty if played well.
---
Man litterly too angry to die
---
I didn't use the transfer because you (and me) have nothing to transfer, just start for free and it's all good
---
Go to Amanda Holiday in the tower and get the campaign called the red war that's the original story of destiny 2. As for your level you can increase it by doing pvp, public events, lost sectors, killing bosses, strikes. Everything in the game really. Up to 900 its fast but after that you'll need to do powerful gear challenges.
---
Happens, keep playing and your ELO will adjust EVENTUALLY.
---
Yeah and on top of that there's the luna and rally barricade auto reload nerf too
---
Kind of like infection in Halo 3? Each "infected" guardian would have a buff called "Corrupted Light" that gives them mad regeneration abilities and cool downs but they would be super weak to certain damage types, kind of like the prism modifier. The infected shields would oscillate (since its not stable) and the opposing team would have to match the elemental type to beat them. The twist is that if the opposing guardian dies, they will become one of the infected and would need to seek their former teammates. Man that would be EPIC!
---
Could these men be my people?
---
Yes on the deleting. 
---
Unsure about Transcendent tho.
---
Good for you. Done my wayfarer and dredgen last season. Got my god rolls. I do need Wendigo actually.
---
Not 100% sure but I think the random bounties have a limit to them. Could also be the quest thing
---
Because that's what heroes do.
---
I wasn't being toxic in the first place, I was asking if he could clarify what he meant. Then you jump in and say that he is new and that I should be less "toxic". If I was new to the game, I'd use the search bar, reword my question, and there would be no problem. There wasn't a problem in the first place, so kindly do everyone a favour and piss off.
---
Outstanding move!
---
No, it‚Äôs in the tower. The wolf icon
---
i used to do pve only but ive gotten into pvp recently, thx for the recommendation btw
---
thanks
---
And yet, you keep the toxicity up, whilst claiming you‚Äôre not being toxic. 
---
Keep up the good work buddy. One day you‚Äôll get there.
---
The ability to see your radar while scoped with MIDA was a huge boon.  I found it outweighed the lower impact.
---
An event can mean multiple things, the IB, a public event, an actual event like the Dawning.. I was asking for clarification.
---
Well it‚Äôs a pvp weapon so that‚Äôs to be expected.
---
Black scorpion got me through the scout rifle kills very nicely, long or short range it was my new best friend.
---
Still use it despite being done.
---
Spoopy? Please do the world a favor and never say that
---
the "nuts" one got me ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
Get where? How the fuck am I being toxic? You just throw that word around like it's nothing!
---
Have a nice day bud.
---
Thanks, you too!
---
If you replace an old mod with a new one (even if it is not as good) will you still get back your old mod?
---
My friend, sounds like you are a natural ‚ÄúReaper‚Äù. The green halo is in your future.
---
Talk to Lord Saladin in the tower, he is above the gunsmith, take the stairs left to the cryptarch. 
---
His icon is a wolf.
---
Help me and mates with raid? We need one more person in Australia
---
Two weeks later and this is still happening.
---
Its about sending a message of annihilating your primeval from 100 to 0 when the enemy team has theirs at 25%
---
Is that scout rifle the new edge transit?
---
This would be a great skit for a "red vs blue" type production but w destiny characters.
---
Thanks man seriously, so other than dismantling an item...
---
If you replace an old mod with a new one (to "get back" the old one without dismantling it), will that be a feasible way to experiment with different mods and builds? 
---
 cause I have been reluctant to apply any mods cause of this...
---
np he's a good guy; he likes to play with others and hope he leaves the "helping" impression to get stuff done to get higher light level; he's always been like that TBH ever since I've met him in World of Warcraft back in 07
---
A weapon you can use to clear blockers quickly, one to kill trash from range, and one to deal with invaders üëå
---
I‚Äôve been abusing the sh*t out of it lol. I love it.
---
Can you tell me what weapons you use so i can just get a rough idea of what my gun pool is?
---
this is a gambit thing right? (ive just returned to the game recently)
---
I hate how people call bungie greedy and a horrible company even though activision ruined the whole series with loot boxes and micro transactions
---
Wish they did sooner because I did it yesterday
---
I wouldn‚Äôt really count Eris or Ikora. For me it‚Äôs
---
Ana, Hawthorne, Amanda,

What if no destiny 3 and just keep developing 2 becuase pls god no

---
Finally? It‚Äôs literally a day 1 free exotic for doing little more than the story
---
What is yours?
---
It‚Äôs said the same way so shut the fuck off
---
I really enjoyed the first day of Iron Banner but after that the whole matches was full of Shotgun titans or other stupidly annoying one hit mechanics
---
I think "scrota, sack of Oryx" is my personal favourite of those
---
I was in that exact lobby and i snickered when i saw it lol
---
may I ask why? it's a great gun.
---
I know,but I dont have quest active, and he doesent offer me one
---
Breakneck, recluse and sleeper
---
No, i must arrange a meeting with this guardian now to shake his hand.
---
Am Hunter main, and haven't been able to kill the same person twice ever since they fucked with its duration way back when. Not like a Striker can so consistently.
---
Hm. That might be it.
---
That's actually not listed, it's especially not rule#8, I don't particular like Obama but seeing his face doesn't automatically make a post political.
---
Cries in fusion rifle
---
It‚Äôs powerful gear. For leveling. She‚Äôs the only tier 3
---
Is there anyway to increase chance of getting a curated Black armory weapon roll or is it just complete RNG?
---
Dang : (
---
You only play pvp but can't handle a pulse rifle, sure dude.
---
Kill enemies. They drop white motes. Higher the enemy difficulty the more motes they drop on death. White glowing enemies drop the most motes.    
---
Collect these motes and bank them in the middle of the map to send taken enemies to the opposite teams side and lock their bank and potentially drain it by sending more than 1 at a time.    
---
5 Motes deposited will send a Taken goblin (These fuckers can make the other taken enemies immune)   
---
10 Motes deposited will send a Taken captain ( THE MOST ANNOYING FUCKERS IN THE GAME. They have literally infinite teleports and can dodge you like Neo. Also, throws blinding attacks at you that take out 1/3rd of your health. TAKE THEM OUT QUICKLY)  
---
15 Motes deposited will send a taken Knight to the other side. (More health and damage than the taken captain AFAIK but are somehow less annoying to deal with ) 
---
20 Motes ( Only in gambit prime and with a +15 collector bonus ) sends a large taken phalanx to the other side  which can tether like a void hunter.   
---
Deposit 65(i think and 100 in gambit prime) motes to summon a primeval.    
---
Defeat primeval envoys (VERY IMPORTANT) to increase your damage output to the primeval.    
---
Kill Your primeval before the opponents defeat theirs to win the game.   
---
Invasions: Occasionally, a portal will open up which will allow you to go to the opponent's side and allows you to kill them to reduce their mote counts.  Killing enemy guardians during the Primeval damage phase will heal their primeval which will cause the enemy team to take LONGER to kill their primeval.
---
Could perhaps Traveller be Obama‚Äôs last name?
---
Randy's from PvP, Edgewise from strikes, grinding for materials to masterwork armor, Undying title. There will also be two new exotic quests (one next week, another the week after), a new dungeon, the culmination of the Vex Offensive and the Festival of the Lost. I think this season Bungie has tried to stagger the content release so there isn't such a lull at the end of the season. I'm not 100% sold on it as it does make the start of the season feel a bit lacking and repetitive, but I am using the slow start to focus on leveling to 950 (should make it there this week) so I can focus on the other stuff as they are released. I also have a few exotic quests and titles to catch up on from previous seasons.
---
Hacking yet leaves the game instead of just slaughtering y'all? Nahhh connection issues.

---
I always advocate for any weapon you're super comfortable with. A lot of people are using scout rifles right now, so if you've got mida multi tool that'll help. I personally use mida and then the mindbenders shotgun. 
---
You might be talking about Eriana's vow? It comes with shadowkeep and its basically a sniper hand cannon; uses special ammo. 
---
The trick to this game mode is to stick with you're team and try to pick off enemies. Pay attention to your lives and try not to rush ahead too much unless you're team is.
---
Also in case you didn't know, there's a survival freelance mode, which is for solo players to match against other solo players. So you don't have situations where you match against a full stack that can communicate with each other and you're just left alone on your team.
---
".. against my fashion." It's still a very good exotic. 
---
Did you try Celestial? Raiden is still first choice for Arcstrider.  You can do nice things with Liars Handshake.
---
Ah. That explains it. Didnt even know that was a thing. 
---
(Returning player from Year 1 you see)
---
Yep that's why he searched in matchmaking. "Let's do this, of fuck my hack I turned on are working, I gotta go guys!".
---
Pull your head outta your ass lol XD
---
I literally just said that I don't play a lot of it, but when I do, it's PvP. And the pulse rifle quest was doable, currently on the fusion rifle that I'm struggling with. It's not the fact that I'm 'not good' with these weapons that iss my issue, it's that I have to use them. It takes the enjoyment out of it for me.
---
No, you will not get the older mod back.
---
["Some" reason is his similar phrase.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWILhrSzw5o)

Now, now. Why so rude, there is no need to be rude. If you feel offended then I'm sorry, but you don't need to read or comment. Have a good day
---
Took me 15 games to get all the quests steps done.  Which is exactly the number of games played for the quest!!!
---
If you are only a pvp playing 15 games without using your load out isn‚Äôt that big of a deal.
---
It actually makes you a better pvp player to play with different loadouts
---
So what is the really issue here, can‚Äôt go into crucible without our crutch weapons?
---
Does she have a second page on her inventory?
---
Maybe you already picked them up, check your Quests.
---
I can recognize it‚Äôs been posted. I can also recognize that Recluse is terribly annoying to fight.
---
You get powerfuls from the weapons as well as from the chassis components?

ah smart!
---
I recently got an outlast w/ kill clip &amp; feeding frenzy &amp; a range masterwork.

It shreds in crucible. Also super easy to use, almost not recoil.

All my armor and weapons from year 1 is basically useless

---
Nobody should feel bad for using a specific loadout. That's why Bungie put it into the game. Enjoy the newly found smg!
---
It is a bit annoying to fit certain weapons to play styles but honestly I kinda enjoyed it maybe the next one will be better. I think they have done better than they had in the past. My only complaint so far would be the lack of diversity in armor it all seems rather ugly but that said all my toons are running the iron banner armor for now.Which I like for the most part.
---
*chuckles in Palpatine*
---
Sunbreaker is cheese too.
---
Do you know a good place to start?
---
Homie it was a joke.

I mean if I was caught hacking (not saying I do.) I would  try to play it off as lag, ignoring the person shooting me. And then leave the game before the player could report. 
---
I think he fooled you. 
---
Not big brain time for you.

A man of culture
---
Destiny has always loved their titans. I remeber being a gunslinger in destiny 1 when Hammers came out. Literally went from no life to quit game in 3 crucible matches.
---
Calm down with the hour long slow-motion edits there.
---
*claps slowly*
---
Yeah I haven't touched my warlock or hunter yet and they're 912 and 911 I believe
---
As someone who uses the Eververse store a good amount i completely agree with you, compared to most games the cosmetic items are relatively cheap and if you dont have the money to buy anything then just grind up for bright engrams or use bright dust
---
Bloody tooth looks even better
---
He is there friday, saturday AND sunday. This post makes no sense.
---
they changed it, now the best thing to use is that, also just use izanagis. d1 had no extra reload speed from stuff like that, you can still 1 phase every boss on there
---
More like old people shoe lol
---
Is the oem hate retired then?  Also bring it on. I've been vaporizing fools out come at me with my actual constant handheld supernova.
---
Yup, Rig is a very good exotic indeed but you gotta look good too you know. I tried Celestial, I like the damage but I found myself not using super as much as I wanted to because I always save for the boss. I'll try Raiden out. I don't play Arc a lot tho.
---
Mara sov tho
---
Wonder when Titan Skating is coming back now.
---
You can get the Thunderlord (The LMG you showed) through random Exotic drops or from an Engram from X√ºr.
---
There are other LMG's like the Hammerhead you can get through finishing a Black Armory frame from Ada-1.
---
In order to get the Black Armory stuff you'll have to own Forsaken (Which I highly recommend, it's great!)
---
Hate the melee hit detection on Striker.  I use sunbreaker instead because it's reliable.  Also, fun fact people, Lord of Wolves still shits on supers, the only exception is dawnblade and sunbreaker really.
---
And here we have the savage haymaker...and here we have rectal hemorrhaging
---
I‚Äôm not on ps4, but the forsaken campaign can be found on the tangled shore map
---
Ik bro, i mean is it the second or the 3rd ?
---
Lol
---
He is also there Monday‚Äôs and Tuesday to the reset.
---
So basically he put in a full week of work what else do you want from the man
---
U rite doe
---
I get what you're saying, but I kinda liked having IB full of variety for once, rather than sweaty meta hot garbage.
---
[removed]
---
It's only plain as day if you're looking for it and you're running more than one character. I personally have never seen it and the asshole I was responding gave a vauge answer that made it sound like he made it up.
---
Futherrmore, Destiny has been offering level progression like this since D1. Again I was unaware of it for Shadowkeep but they offered you a [Spark if Light ](https://gameranx.com/features/id/160924/article/destiny-2-forsaken-level-up-instantly-with-sparks-of-light-quick-campaign-start-guide/) in D1 that came with purchase of the Taken King or you could buy it separately for $30.  This is not a new practice. So you can take your fake rage elsewhere.
---
Ahaha
---
I'm blind, I see nothing.
---
Both actually
---
slide-shadestepping-into-a-vase-suicide
---
No revoker sorry auto correct on phone
---
Yes it does. If you can stack 3x raiden flux and the reflection damage bonus from middle tree it gets pretty crazy numbers. But only for a few seconds and it‚Äôs hard to set it up.
---
That looks amazing good job
---
I didn‚Äôt realize the sniper rifle twilight oath was big enough to host a crucible map!
---
I don't speak about pvp specifically, by the way.  
---
For example, Ikora's Vex Offensive bounties.  
---
Kills with shotguns, SMGs, hand cannons, fusion rifles, rocket launches, auto rifles, bows, etc. 
---
It forces to constantly carry many weapons and then stand still swapping them between bounties, not contributing to the team's efforts, and not helping with triumphs some as killing Vex Offensive boss in one phrase.  
---
Making bounties refer to primargy, energy, and heavy weapon types + killing enemies in streaks and/or killing specific enemies (there is a couple of bounties such as "kill a # of hobgoblins") will both make the effort less clunky and won't hinder your team in any way too much.
---
Nah bro, don't try that shit.
---
Cerberus +1 is an absolute beast in crucible.
---
Definitely gonna have to try this. Good find my dude!
---
Does it work that way? I went 1 v 1 a guy earlier with AB rounds on his recluse and didn‚Äôt hit me through my barrier.
---
The guns special perks are what make them special and there are raids nightfalls and the crucible to do along with pinochle quests from the tower venders
---
Sauce?
---
And all the season passes
---
"I BET THEY DIDN'T EXPECT THAT!"
---
I have a full proof plan to not get ‚Äúripped off‚Äù by the eververse store.
---
Ya don‚Äôt buy any silver.
---
Wow thanks I‚Äôm cured.
---
ah, I see. Thanks!
---
I know just salty sarcasm
---
No, you also get the next 3 season passes for destiny 2 which in itself is most likely going to be a $30 value.
---
I think that the powerful bow weapon frame is currently bugged. I just did one and successfully forged the spiteful fang but only the first weapon I forged (hammerhead) was counted towards both quest steps. After I forged the spiteful fang, I was able to complete another powerful pulse rifle weapon frame and that counted towards the quest step.
---
I suggest not doing the powerful bow weapon frame if you are working towards finishing the quests step, unless you want to forge 3 weapons (including spiteful fang).
---
Dragons Shadow is great for PvP. Gwisin was broken, but should still be okay-ish. 
---
I recently started using Kepris Sting - unsure if I like it or not. The effect is actually great with a certain playstyle (rushing with recluse, finishing with melee)
---
Most weekly bounties do not have way points. They are just things you do along the way.
---
Bug? or feature?
---
Ok haha
---
Hammerhead is a legendary you get from doing the forges
---
Weapon handling reduces recoil? 
---
Is this a fact?
---
You mean the season pass, access to the campaign of forsaken, I dont know if forsaken guns drop without the dlcs, and the raid in dreaming city?
---
*one eye mask
---
I was expecting all of you to be blown sky high.
---
His other two teammates.
---
Huh weird
---
I run and capture whenever we have less than 2 zone controlled.  Then I camp near a zone so the spawns don't flip.  I like the action coming to me, and I can maintain a slight advantage by swapping my location after each kill (in the rare case the other team is actually communicating).
---
I'm not a great player by any means, but I still try to play the objective as best I can.
---
Ok so how do I complete them? I see nothing indicating that I should kill something or someone
---
Bounties won‚Äôt typically have a waypoint. They are more like ‚Äúdo this thing while doing other things‚Äù. Like ‚Äúget so many arc kills in gambit‚Äù type things. Really just look at what the bounty says and who you got it from to determine what you need to do. Zavala will be strike focused, Shaxx is crucible, and the drifter is gambit. All the other bounties are either open to whatever activity or location specific if you get them from a location vendor.
---
I've been using this name for quite some time
---
Loosen his boot laces and potentially create a trip hazard in the work place

---
I guess you haven‚Äôt played in a few seasons? Cuz titans have been broken since forsaken.
---
You should have access to each subclass and the top an bottom skill trees if your f2p. If you purchase foresaken you have the third skill path unlocked for free
---
I can remember being in Rumble in D1 grinding for Thorn way back when Thorn was still a viable PvP option and noticing that everyone else was getting shots off with void weapons so I took a shot. Messaged three players and we built a team to take turns trading kills. I was still a struggling player then and felt so welcome.
---
Time and experience has made me more cynical about the community than I perhaps should be. Too many years of bounties that run contrary to team spirit have made some of us a little bit more assholey than we used to be. I'm glad your story happened, it gives me hope for the future.

Wait, that's *possible*? Me and my fireteam all ran hard light for a bit when we got it and I don't remember any of us noticing self-damage, even when you couldn't see the room you were in for bouncy rave lasers.
---
How do I get a black scorpion?
---
Jumped to fire void warlock super in Vex Offensive last night. Teammate jumped in front of me and intercepted it.
---
That's strange...... Probably has something to due with lower load on the card even though there's high temp in certain areas. Could be wrong though. Try setting a set fan curve that has it at like 45% non stop even under low load then ramp up under heavy load while playing destiny.
---
Damn. Seems really useless for Hunters then :/
---
*cough* mountain top
---
u/uwutranslator
---
Yes. Just select them with a click of your cursor button. The middle tree of each subclass requires the purchase of either shadowkeep or forsaken.  You may need to level up. It should tell you what you need to do in order to unlock them.
---
He aint new. Its very popular now pretend to be new and beg for attention.
---
Raids are end-game acitivies that can host 6 players.
---
Puzzles, challenges are designed around this player number.
---
Raid lairs have no matchmaking, except for guided games, but those take a very long time to find and can be quite unpleasant.
---
You best bet is to go on Discord or other LFG (looking for group) sites and find a team.
---
Leviathan is a Year 1 raid, and it's not the focus of most raid groups nowadays. The gear you find there has no random rolls, so they are not meta.
---
Armor has Armor 2.0 features, and can be good, but nothing extraordinary.
---
Yea it‚Äôs busted and I love it
---
OG quickfang
---
not at all, no ones making you buy it, and you should already be close to 900 light once you finish shadowkeep story.
---
And what evidence do you have to say he isn‚Äôt new
---
thanks very helpful! i have the mida mini tool. the others not yet. will upgrade the weapon to my level and try it out!
---
I'm actually surprised that there's so little.... "research" of her.
---
Agree, Skyburner is slept on. Really fun scout that makes this quest almost bearable.
---
You get all black armory quests from Ada-1, but the Izanagi quest is currently glitched and is unfinishable
---
It's close battle between this gun and recluse for best smg. If you you get the catalyst it reloads the entire magazine when you get a kill!!
---
I bet he hasn't even heard of the legend of the broken arms kid. Or even the swamps of Dagobah.
---
Comfortable.. maybe .. but the design is Premature . Me , all white UGG bedspread on a King ,hoes love it ;)) lol
---
Just like it‚Äôs popular to complain without giving examples how to fix what your complaint about just like most of you posts about destiny
---
Shaxx doesn't have the quest for me
---
Good to know Mara sov didn't ditch us males.
---
Yeh I know what you meant üëåüèΩ
---
1) yeh if you need a good one farm the one from eris
---
2) honestly out of those 3 you're best off with loaded question imo, but if you have a firing line sniper or izanagi's burden that's the best choice for dps, izanagi is also good for majors though as the damage per shot is silly.
---
3) exotic slot in pve is prbly best used on huckleberry or izanagi's burden, anarchy is also still great if you have it.
---
4) major spec all the way as that also helps out for other enemies if you need to.
---
5) best heavy in pvp is a tie between wardcliff coil, truth, and deathbringer atm. but you can honestly do work with a grenade launcher if you knw what you're doing.
---
6) depends on what you're trying to do, if you need supers and just small add clear, go for juju, if you need to clear majors and small ads but super isn't something you use often or need outbreak is the better pick.
---
hope i helped have a nice day.
---
nah it's definitely still a solid perk. Especially if you use your dodge for ya know, dodging. It also pairs really well with wormhusk crown so I've been told. I do find though it saves a lot of people I'm fighting, like if I melee and the overshield just eats it then I get counter-melee'd or shotgunned
---
 Hi fighting,, I'm Dad!

Could be taken a step further and needing to have all the parts in invetory and dismatle them and pay to make the ornaments.

Happy birthday mate!!!

Great! Another 30 hours for catalyst then lol

Awesome, I hope it can work out for ya! Don't get frustrated if you lose a bunch at first, survival takes some practice

im sorry I did a mistake there I meant to say The Stolen black armory key is not dropping From Killing the Fallen
---
Christ if the colour beige was a person it'd be you.
---
If the cosmetics affect your or anyone else's enjoyment of the game, then they are a game mechanic and therefore not free from scrutiny. I consider that still pay to win, because players are judged by aesthetics. Making the excuse "it's just cosmetic" justifies greedy behavior on the part of the developer and publisher.
---
In Free to Play games, I will give some leeway because they have to make money some how. That's why warframe and the "Light" Free to Play Destiny 2 edition are not judged as harshly as I judge Overwatch.
---
Was the Treads Upon Stars the year 2 version of the VoC or was it just the same gun model? I remember the Treads it was one of my favorite guns.
---
Not sure if I'd call it busted lol, but it's neat that you can get a collat.
---
Is Iron Banner only this week, or is it a 2-week long event? I'm curious because I'd like to hit 950 before I start getting those rewards.
---
 Hi curious, I'm Dad!
---
Jotunn is good for this step too.
---
I literally can‚Äôt comprehend how a bug that detrimental to gameplay still exists YEARS later. Astounding
---
The solution is incredibly simple: run strikes with your friends instead of matchmaking with strangers and hoping they will be sympathetic to your bounty needs.
---
og better devils or my snapshot explosive rounds one, have a combined 20K plus kills on em but there's nothing special about em. just like using it for normal pve stuff.
---
I played Destiny 2 on [battle.net](https://battle.net) for a while, but today I noticed it just disappeared. After investigating for a bit, I found out it was moved to steam.
---
Is there a way to move my old progress over to steam?
---
But with everyone having access to black armory, getting a machine gun is very easy.
---
I got it passively. I was on the grind to recluse, just using a grenade launchers with power. By the time I got recluse, mountaintop was 80% done
---
Could be me then. I also main warlock

Mobility doesn't affect sprint speed, just strafing.

Unfortunately  no, no its not, trackless wast cant roll with a perk that increases its body shot damage to pve enemies by 92%,

---
Huh, I have 3 characters above 20 (all max level 900+ light) and no achievement on xbox.
---
[My setup.](https://imgur.com/a/HD0kwno)
---
If you're in a corridor and have no decent counters available, it pretty much just turns into the hallway scene from Old Boy.
---
The rank points go down? I‚Äôm kinda scared now since I‚Äôm almost done with the 2100 rank thing
---
this is over a year old.
---
That's weird... Try to exit and then go in and apply it again maybe. If that doesn't work then maybe contact Bungie or something idk.
---
I would definitely try this way. You can one these thrall with basically any gun.
---
That moment when you try and flex four gold medals....
---
AYYYYYYYYY OH
---
&gt;Melee, and if they're still alive
---
you did something wrong Titan.
---
Yeah, rank went down, and if you don't have a constant win streak, you're shit out of luck
---
Cool thanks for replying :)
---
Full Auto and Zen Moment?
---
If I'm not mistaken (which I may very well be) it's available from your collections tab. Failing that, Gunsmith for random rolls.
---
Fantastic weapon go farm the catalyst by doing heroic adventures.
---
I need a red circle for this
---
Or if you were in a raid youd be like welp I'll just sit behind you
---
I relate to that last one
---
It used hunter dodge with graviton forfeit
---
I don‚Äôt think use an SMG is accurate anymore. I just got  kills with it some people didn‚Äôt even see me so perfect kills and still 0/25. I also didn‚Äôt get credit for a fusion rifle kill so I‚Äôm super confused/annoyed
---
Overwatch is completely cosmetic though.
---
Just came up against a team who 5 players were in a squad all running. Around together all using recluse. Wasn‚Äôt a point of me even bothering as a solo q üòÇ that weapon needs banning
---
Terrifying. Congrats!
---
But i only got to the step 20 minutes ago and just grabbed the 6 he had plus a couple extra. Its still missing at least 2
---
Don't listen to that ass, you coming here IS learning, IS research.
---
Use it. When bungie nerfs it because so mean many people cry about it..  then rage.  You put in the work and felt with the frustration of horrible matchmaking
---
I have a friend who has a 3D printer and I was wondering if you let other people use your designs?
---
*interstellar music intensifies*
---
It‚Äôs the entrance to the raid.
---
It‚Äôs for divinity mate been out weeks now
---
WAIT CAYDE DIES?!!?! WTF SPOILERS, MAN!
---
Normal catalyst, just go kill like 500 things total
---
Erianas catalyst, literally go play like 1000 matches of anything because fuck y'all
---
It‚Äôs for divinity.
---
ok how the fuck do you get a **FUCKING TANK on the  MOON ???**
---
It‚Äôs the raid exotic
---
My friend is named eris morn's used tampon...
---
Same here. Thought I was doing something wrong for the bounty completion but I guess it is bugged. Any word on this?
---
Weeklies probably dont count either. Shax only has 4 regular crucible bounties a day
---
This is for divinity. Old news at this point. Sorry to spoil the excitement
---
They need eververse now more than ever. The game is free so now they don‚Äôt make any money on that. I get why they have to pack eververse with stuff now.
---
It's the quest for the Divinity exotic trace rifle
---
I‚Äôm nearly on +16 and it‚Äôs a slog lol
---
Divinity exotic
---
Hell of a drop.
---
You just can't infuse constantly.  I'd wait until you had gear maybe 10 levels up and use it then.
---
I did IB at 935LL and I'll happily wear this gear and infuse it over time.  The set looks amazing with the Cricible Vermillion shader.  Shiny red and black awesomeness.
---
Well that sucks lol. Oh well. Guess ill have to wait
---
Same.
---
that would be nice, a maximum cap  
---
and with new players i was thinking about players who started out, got some stuff and want to do more end game pinnicle stuff.  
---
You can try to get into the end game PvP but as time goes on it get's harder and harder to get into it.
---
Silly question from a gambit veteran but how do you know when the opposing team has an invasion coming up?
---
got launched like that once while on a cabal interceptor doing escalation protocol
---
I see what you did there
---
Why is there just a floating thruster?
---
Ffs bet you have recluse too üò¢ do it but be on my team üòâ
---
New to destiny 2, what is that subclass?
---
Lot of losers in that thread. I'll take Ana Gay. I'll just make a female character now.
---
The days of actually sticky tripmines (complete with walls that didn't point the beam into a corner every God damn time) that could stick to heads and head shot throwing knife kills were the best.
---
i killed alot of vex so i guess ill just keep doing it until it drops
---
Petra as well
---
Anyone know how to unlock achievement 23? I have a title, but it hasn't unlocked yet. All of the other 22 unlocked the minute I opened up the game on the 1st.
---
did you figure it out ? Where do I find this playlist
---
Personally I don't feel it should be friendly players who just started. Its end game for a reason
---
Shotgun meta is still a thing? Sucks to hear
---
Also with nova bombs...
---
I don‚Äôt know if you can compare the two. Recluse is out of control even after being nerfed, vision was good but not game changing
---
Does it keep going up each time?
---
1 question tho
---
why do u have just grenade launchers
---
Do tracer rifles now bounce off you?
---
I think the issue some are taking with that is that Eververse in this new Activision-free season is quantifiably worse than last seasons, not a good look for Bungie. Shadowkeep is great but there are legitimate gripes to have.
---
imagine the sitters of this game thinking that they are doing nothing wrong and so they blame their being bad at the game on its just a game just have fun it's not serious but for some people it is serious and you are not only ruining their chances to rank up by going into a competitive game when you know you aren't good enough for it you also basically spit in their face by saying its just a game blah blah blah just have fun playing this game is their passion and someone that doesn't see the game like they do and take it seriously like they do doesn't deserve to be praised or given sympathy. Now I don't know what happened in your game or how well you or he did but if you really were playing trash as hell and you were the cause of the loss and you do that consistently in every game then you shouldn't be playing competitive because it brings your rank down along with everyone else rank just play norms until you get better and there are no ranks to care about I played a survival game with my friend and this loser of a human being lost almost all our lives every time all by himself and he got like no kills so he just trolled I called him out and then next game he was on the enemy team he popped off and was a big threat to me but he pissed me off so I put my other two teammates on my shoulders and beat his ass because I hate losers like him
---
Edit: In addition, Forsaken has a lot more content on its release than Shadowkeep does right now, but a lot of its already been released for free to New Light Players. I‚Äôm not sure of everything that is locked in Forsaken so that‚Äôs your call as far as content. In my opinion Forsaken‚Äôs campaign is better and longer as of right now, but Shadowkeep‚Äôs campaign isn‚Äôt really even over yet either. Either way, have fun!
---
What shotgun is that
---
he'll yeah borther
---
Every game has its issues,I guess we will have to see in the future for what happens
---
You punch those tears back into your eyeballs right this moment! Titans don't have time to cry, too many things need punching.
---
Look at their progress bar.  They will have a flashing pointer.  If not that then a message will pop up at the bottom left (the place where the x deposited 10 motes message pops up)
---
Ah right, I totally forgot it was a PvE powerhouse too! I just remember getting slaughtered in year 1 rumble
---
He blended in
---
Im making this my name now
---
Top tree sunbreaker + hallowfire
---
Or literally any other titan subclass other than bottom tree striker
---
If you have friends who want to Raid then Forsaken is a great choice. It comes with 3 Raids and Last Wish is a long one.
---
Titan uses Barricade: It‚Äôs very effective and defends it against attacks!
---
Hunter uses dodge: It... it reloads a weapon..?
---
that is just dumb. fuck me that would be so demoralizing. I'm already so demoralized. I often times play for fun and just do what I like doing but I stopped doing that and focused on light grind and I feel like it got me actually fucking no where. what a waste of time.
---
Whaaaaaaaa, the class that should be able to one hit melee, can!  Let's call the whaaaambulance while I cry about it some more on Reddit.  Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaambulaaaaance.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Seriously, you can make a build, with exotics to one hit melee on a class that SHOULD be able to one hit melee, which clearly you can't counter so your recourse is to come here and whine about it being OP?  
---
It's not OP, it's just that you don't have enough P.  Each class has OP characteristics...the game is to maximise your potential while minimizing others, instead of crying focus on success.  If you want to melee be a Titan, if you want distance and sniping be a hunter.  Their exotic attributes define how they're to be played.  Yes liars handshake exists and yes titans can play distance, it doesn't mean that's their strengths or the smart way to play them.
---
But...
---
Whaaaaaaaambulaaaaance
---
Cancer isn't funny or witty. Should change your title kid
---
I have a Night Watch with snapshot and moving target that I use all the time, just because it's enjoyable. #notallscouts
---
Will do
---
Cue ProZD ‚ÄúThis is my ass kicking outfit bitch!‚Äù

That's a Texas sized 10-4 Good buddy

How it launched your dead body was the best part. Totally ragdolled into oblivion

Was it worth it? I still don‚Äôt have it yet
---
Gotta delete it to do so.  Weird
---
See I do this but not as much of an oh shit reaction but more of a, "I don't care anymore so I'm gonna solo BB you and thats all there is to it"
---
Huckleberry + another smg + peacekeepers = profit
---
Having trouble doing Escalation Protocol solo. Is it possible? I'm a 918 hunter.
---
Where have you been the past weeks
---
It‚Äôs the start of the raid
---
I've always had great experiences with the destiny 1/2 community. Some of the best with the people ball in number 1.
---
Of course I enjoy it, was just joking about killing them with the emote, lol.  That is always the best part about the first IB of a season, all the underpowered people that you can one shot kill with an smg.  I actually got a triple kill from dragonfly on my subtle calamity yesterday, that was epic!  By the end of the season, there are very few not at max light...and that is not nearly as much fun.
---
If I‚Äôm not mistaken. 960 is the hard cap. Then everything after that comes from the artifact leveling up.
---
That was the best "No u" I've seen in this game. Lmao
---
You have to shoot at the wall at a precise angle to kill yourself with ricochet rounds. Usually takes most of the mag though, so the guy you replied to is probably full of shit
---
Crown Splitter is a Legendary does that apply aswell?
---
People have been using Teamspeak and Discord since ever so whats the point of an ingame chat system? Why would you want to run raids with randoms when what you described in your experience in crucible would just repeat itself there? 
---
All your problems would be solved if you would join an active clan but you don't want to "commit" to that so you're fucked i guess.
---
I usually kill things near the bases, the cabal have given me a few so it might be best to just grind near their base on the EDZ.
---
[Armor 2.0 Tutorial/Guide.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt66-xEJrXY) It explains a bit, but it's still a little confusing.
---
And then there are bottom tree striker titans with oem and ace of spades/ j√∂tunn
---
Armor ornaments are only the Eververse sets, all the world drops you have to get themselves
---
Jotunn is broken for this. Im having so much fun finishing this part
---
I just find it hilarious how everyone thought the greed would disappear when the Activision/bungie split happened.
---
But now I guess you can buy your second character level 900 for twenty-fucking-dollars.
---
$20 for 10-15 minutes of work.
---
Your getting exotics? Lucky you.
---
Indeed ü§ï
---
if you do a nightfall in the rewards tab it says exotic(rare) i think your just unluckily lucky
---
So it's join a clan or 90% of the content in the game is shit or unplayable? Really great system there.
---
Even the guardians superpower(or how you would call the ultimate) can't survive a charging titan
---
Yes you have to grind certain things to farm the good rolls on weapons
---
Infusing is for when you want to raise the light level of a gun.  You infuse a gun you don‚Äôt want that has a higher level I to that gun.
---
I don‚Äôt recommend infusing until you hit end game
---
It's all random drops
---
*shits in trespasser*
---
Basically yes, you infuse higher (useless) stuff into lower but better (in terms of stats/rolls) stuff. Since infusing is kinda costly for new players you should have a look on when it‚Äôs ‚Äûworth‚Äú it.
---
Its the same for me
---
Honestly bungie pls never change sparrows. This is fun
---
YEEESSSS!!!
---
Ran into the guy the other day. Had to stop killing him because it was too much. We just harvested his fireteam instead
---
you're completely wrong or lying about discord.
---
Yeah I got an exotic ghost shell and my second pair of Orpheus Rigs together just now. And another strike I had b2b exotic legs Stompee and another. Need help how tf can I get weapons? I am frustrated
---
cuz it has one eyed and cause bottom tree striker
---
seems like good exotic engram rng but bad rng opening them, exotics are meant to be rare, and there are a couple of exotic quests for weapons you can grind for.
---
With new light everyone starts out at 750, they also automatically increased the might level for everybody to 750
---
The soft cap is 900 currently but you can get higher
---
Which sucks. Let's put in pursuits that run contrary to the actual objective. üëèüëè
---
Oh my bad probably not but I'm not sure.
---
Are you sure? Isn't it because most exotic weapons are locked behind Forsaken
---
They def arnt going to remove supers from comp since supers are a core component of the game
---
The scout from Vex offensive with snapshot/no distractions/stability barrel+rounds has been 3 tapping from across the map in iron banner for me
---
I don't have Forsaken only shadowkeep
---
Try using [this](https://discord.me/d2pclfg) discord for lfg for anything in the game. For iron banner I 100% recommend using a 6 stack because that‚Äôs mostly what you will be fighting.
---
All abilities are broken.
---
Thanks Mr. face. (I'm being polite due to the fear struck in my heart by your name)
---
No Distractions feels like a must for that scout. I have one with that and Explosive payload.
---
campaigns can be picked up from amanda holliday in the tower, so no worries about missing a campaign. other than that, not too much.
---
Glad to help out man
---
its really easy after shadowkeep, i got to legend in about 3-4 hours
---
Then change the playlist from ‚Äúcompetitive‚Äù to ‚Äúif you control power ammo and supers you will every single game and you‚Äôll get to 5500 in an hour‚Äù
---
It all depends on the make up if you have plenty of guys above 940 you can sneak through being at 920.
---
I‚Äôd recommend being around 930 if you can
---
You cannot play on the same account on two platforms at one time.
---
Cross save means that you choose one bungie character account to play on across all platforms.  If your dad is playing on your PS4 account on the PS4 and you login to your PC account that uses the PS4 cross saved characters you will boot him out because it is the same Bungie character account.
---
Before cross save he was playing on your PS4 character account and you were playing on your PC character account..
---
Just as an FYI...If your dad creates his own PS4 account an plays on your PS4 primary machine he can play any of your games without having to purchase them on his PS4 account.  He could then play on his Bungie character account and you could play at the same time.
---
I'm doing exotic (uncommon). I am 931 and grinded from 750. I have never ever gotten an exotic weapon drop in 15 exotic drops. Currently on gear grind to 950 so I can do the second hardest Nightfall where exotics are common
---
F. U. Man!
---
 GG. EZ.
---
I didn‚Äôt know that dang. I would have been doing that and working on another triumph at the same time.
---
They‚Äôre both equalizers. Meant for bad players so they don‚Äôt get farmed.
---
Okay, when I infuse do I lose perks on the one im increasing level on?
---
It‚Äôs METAPHORICAL!
---
yeah ur just lucky
---
I agree that a vendor refresh isn‚Äôt as big of a deal as most people seemed to think, and I‚Äôd personally rather have a smaller more curated collection of legendary weapons than a larger pool of crappy ones.
---
Laughs in way of the current* "any distance is melee distance to me"
---
about 920 before you are too squishy and you get your team wiped too many times, just do your weeklies and you‚Äôll be fine.
---
Literally the only titan super I actually am afraid of
---
That‚Äôs a really long game mode name
---
it was in my vault. its 74 light. i have no idea.
---
how do I know how high the light level will go, say if I get rid of a 500 light gun to increase. 400 light gun, do I increase my 400 to 500? also do I lose the perks on the lower level gun or do they stay the same
---
I never get the stuff I want though.... like Liar's. I also want some amazing rifle/SMG/Sniper/MG that I can use... and I never ever get one
---
Because Titan was mid-tier in D1 so the buffed the shit out of them here.
---
As someone who has been killed by tethers that should have missed (saw a recording of the other person's POV) but auto-locked and killed me, I strongly agree.
---
hey at least there powerful drops
---
Ah, so it's a World Drop then? Why does the Collections Tab still say it drops as a Campaign Reward for the Red War?
---
I think Prometheus lense works
---
I think it's due to the player count. Most of my 75-20 games were after a long period of searching for lobbies. When the MM is quick it's usually a close game.
---
I mean that sounds more like your not getting teammates that know what they are doing
---
Heavy and super are core of everything in this game
---
If you want a pvp that doesn‚Äôt have this new cod comes out in two weeks
---
So new players have no reason to play the legacy campaigns ? Dang....i thought i could get some easy exotics that way
---
Yeah it drops as a random exotic, got it after completing a crucible match.
---
From what i know its a max of 25% detonation damage buff not impact damage. Spike granades buff impact damage on the other hand
---
DEW IT!
---
You never lose perks, the only things that changes is the light level
---
I do this all the time, but intentionally cause I find it funny. It does take most of the magazine. I can't see doing it accidentally unless you were already shot to shit.
---
In a 3 stack?
---
Someone got sniped
---
No, there are a ton of legendarys as well:  Austringer, Service Revolver, Pluperfect, Blast Furnace, Bite of the Fox, Tranquility, Parcel of Stardust, Bygones, The Spiteful Fang,  Go Figure, and on and on
---
No, the catalyst is not dropping yet.
---
Yeah, every life in every game.
---
No, only light level gets increased. Stat rolls stay the same
---
I noticed you didn't mention warlock?
---
yes, but on my brothers account soloing i got to fabled in 2 h
---
Do you think I should get Forsaken to unlock some guns so that they start dropping for me?
---
I mean that didn't stop people from using fist of panic as well so...
---
What a beauty! I got three pairs of boots and a garbage rolled shotgun and pulse rifle :,)
---
It's an annoying quest, but it's not hard. Takes one night tops if you're bad (which I am.... it took me a night of playing 3-4 hours), and that's including the horrible toxic meta and unbalanced state of crucible.
---
I've been using eriana's with any other kinetic hand cannon (I'm sure theres a best one) and lucky pants, I'll hit the headshot with erianas and then switch to the other hand cannon super fast with the illegally modded holster and finish them with a body shot. Super quick 2 shot kill
---
sorry man, UK, should of specified. My bad.
---
I don't get it
---
thanks for the heads up, i'll do that now.
---
That's just good content right there.
---
Eriana's Vow seems to pack a punch with Shield Piercing rounds.
---
All you need to do is own the season pass or level the normal one to level 35 if you don't have the season pass.
---
Khaki lol
---
Well at least you dont get an enemy team of 6 meta-using tryhards in the classic mix. üòÇ
---
Id rather face a firing squad of Multi-tools than deal with one chickenshit who spams GL.
---
I NEED A HUNTER LIKE YOU IN THE REDJACKS!

They aren't talking about bubble, they are talking about full barriers compared to rally barricades

Can u tell me what this thing is actually called IRL
---
Its mesmerizing 
---
I want one
---
I have full trials flawless gear, plus ornaments. ... Can't wear it in armor 2.0
---
God I want this.
---
Just run 3 fusion rifles and you'll be right. I did and I got it done in like 2 matches.
---
Yep! Same old, some old
---
These will never not be hilarious
---
People who are significantly higher power than you*
---
D2 PvP is no where near as fun and fluid as D1.
---
Just play the Vex Offensive for Optative. Probably the easiest and fastest way to get a decent hand cannon.
---
you were this close to greatness
---
yeah man. I have my own clan but it's just because i was bored.
---
Definitely not the oblivious guys fault either. /s
---
Destiny is the only game where either objects or my teammates have the timing of literal gods.

Wait what's oem mean

I love this copypasta
---
Whoa they need to nerf titans ASAP!!!! Broken!!!! Hax!!!!!!!!!!!!111111111
---
Why can't more people be this nice, I was playing iron banner today and this guy was bming throughout the game. I didn't think much of it just a simple case of people being people but after my team and I pull out a win at the last second I got a message from this guy calling me trash and over all being toxic seeing as he was bottom of his teams leaderboard with a 0.27, Just makes me wish more people were like this and realised its just a game.
---
*cries in hunter tether sticking to the ceiling or wall*
---
Looks like the screenshot was taken in the collections
---
Whenever I melee one of those boomy bois and live, I feel as if I have somehow passed some Titan test of strength and feel a little better about myself.
---
Eh, the jumps make you outspeed any hunter's movement, so you can juke them really easily, as well as sword jump at mach 5 willy nilly
---
Mine has Rapid Hit and headseeker, is that a good combo? it was better than the my Go Figure, which i'd been using from light level 840-930
---
yeah man, I have my own clan but it was because i was bored.
---
Awwwww big oof :( hope you find some peeps to play with :)
---
Xur. That's how i've gotten 90% of my exotics.
---
Lmao when was the last time I saw trials gear fucking ridiculous that armor with ornaments is one of the coolest looking set as well.
---
You use ding dong pistols as well? Is that *also* an Outrageous Fortune??????? HENLO FRIEND!
---
Lol so $20 to level up your second/third guardian to level 900 isnt being greedy?
---
Really???
---
Step 1) equip wizened rebuke or erentil
---
Step 2) kill opponents
---
Step 3) profit!
---
Is it really that good? Because im literally using some random ass autopistol and winning fights against it pretty easily, and im not exactly good
---
B o o s t
---
Shit even a 3v1
---
Edit: Without well or Bubble I mean. With well and bubble I think Titan would win

So I went back later and it was randomly there. I was able to find the thorn quest in the ashes. Did it on another character as well. The other quest is for the Luninia or whatever light version of thorn there is. If you couldn't find the thorn quest, I'd go back and try again. It seems to be bugged every so often.
---
Would you like me to congratulate you for your observational skills or something? You're the only one giving a shit about my first comment.
---
It‚Äôs not there. I heard something about I have to do the memory of sai Moto questline
---
Meta basically means what is currently good/viable.
---
This is used in a ton of other games as well.

‚ÄúYOU FAILED!‚Äù

I was just commenting on my experience of 3 out of 4 matches being played on D1 maps.
---
So what I see is just something that will not happen? :(
---
And I was so excited that it would give me what I want :D
---
Not Nice
---
Naw love using the finisher to send cursed thralls directly at my bubby!
---
I played so much crucible, could've had it done already but since all the weapons i use are energy weapons, i'm shit outta luck.
---
Try lfg or r/fireteams
---
Spectral and Nova Warp were the most cancerous things ever in all fairness
---
*cries in Polaris Lance
---
Nah man i meant i'll join your clan :) i meant i'd have no problem leaving my clan cause it was just there cause i was bored haha.
---
I guess I'm out of luck, then. Only have fusion rifles for the second slot
---
Yeah, its almost like you need to complete something before Saladin deems you worthy of the gear. Getting dumpstered left and right in the Iron Banner isn't enough for free gear. Git gud
---
On PC Lightweights are pretty cool, stuff like the Ace of Spades, Austringer, etc, on console precision frames are best frames, most notably the Trust in the non pinnacle hand cannons
---
The joke is that these lore pieces are fan fictions written by Calus or his scribes, they‚Äôre not true, nor set in stone
---
Agreed. You post one message saying you want to raid and you'll get dozens of msgs 3 seconds later.
---
Engaging an OEM is the real life-or-death gamble.
---
I have been doing this quest since Tuesday while I get fucked trying to get new weapons since all the ones I had on my vault are now useless.
---
Favorite map............ Twilight oath
---
Read your own post again. There's a huge difference between an opinion and complaining about something! Clearly you don't know the difference.
---
I did it because I wanted the neato guns, but mostly the sidearm. In the end, it was a fun side thing to work on and I got what I was after.
---
Are you Glory rank Fabled or Valor ranked Fabled?  They are two very different things.  Glory can only be gotten by playing on the far right middle node (3X3 competitive play for Glory) or the small node just to the bottom right (competitive single play for Glory)  everything else gives Valor, not Glory and shows your Valor rank when you hover over the node.
---
I had a somewhat similar experience with a guy on the enemy team. I was grinding for valor rank (and ended up annihilating the enemy team) and was trying so less I was god like. It‚Äôs match point and there‚Äôs literally only one guy on the enemy team. Me and my teammates ant communicate, but we looked at each other, knowing we had to just become friends with her (yes, it was a her), and then there were ten seconds on the clock. The unfortunate solo tried to jump off the edge of a cliff, so me and my teammates did the only reasonable thing and killed ourselves first. Next round she tried to kill us, and my teammates popped their supers. I can never forget that split second look I got where the girl tried to emote out of it and got double slammed. If only it could have ended differently ,_,
---
Didnt hear anything about this, just raw distance. Like example: if you are 50meters from the target you get max 25% increase to detonation damage. So height and time in the air or projectile speed i think does not take a part in this particular perk calculation

Titan aren't really useful at endgame besides weapons of light
---
Can I post this image next week?
---
When you see them coming, jump back. If you don't see them coming, you'd probably have died to many things.
---
Its purple. But I dont see anywhere to apply it
---
OP is just waiting for the shader to load on console
---
I thought this was a destiny meme on r/shitpostcrusaders at first lol
---
That's nice
---
Good thing you beat Fart Propelled. He was about to gas up the whole match.
---
If you have universal armour ornaments, do this:
---
1. Go to inventory
---
2. Select armour
---
3. If you are on PC -&gt; hit key "S" to go down to other menu (for cosmetics)
---
4. You should see shaders section AND ornaments section (box)
---
5. If you are on PC -&gt; hover your mouse over ornaments box -&gt; you should see options which you can apply.
---
Here is link to good article:  [https://www.polygon.com/2019/8/14/20805796/armor-customization-explained-armor-2-0-mods-energy-masterwork-ornament-exotic](https://www.polygon.com/2019/8/14/20805796/armor-customization-explained-armor-2-0-mods-energy-masterwork-ornament-exotic)
---
Scroll down to **Universal Ornaments** section, you should see a screenshot of cosmetics menu
---
You now get the quest from Ada-1 in the tower.  Not sure if you can get it without Forsaken though.
---
Also do I have to hit "unlock" on the ornament first?
---
Melee
---
It might be only be available on 2.0 armor? Not sure what would be causing that.
---
Hahaha. Right? I was the same way. The weapons are subpar. Got a couple good rolls. But I remember being obsessed with the ghost shell at launch of Osiris.
---
Thanks! It was definitely a grind but much better than getting matched up against 4 stacks that would just stomp your team of randos. The best advice I can give is to not ride a losing streak. If you lose 2/3 games in a row, just walk away. You‚Äôll end up doing more damage than good because you‚Äôll be reeling on the loses. Take the wins when you can get them and know when it‚Äôs better to walk away for a bit. You‚Äôll get there.

Cerberus + Sentient Arc Soul is life.  My build allows me to have infinite sentient arc soul, lol.
---
Oh yeah. If the ornament is still in your invt tab, you unlock it there. Then it should be available to apply to your pieces
---
I do
---
Well, that triumph rewards you with the recluse.
---
No because it shows the level 50 which is pre-shadowkeep and is already an old repost
---
You thought it was r/shitpostcrusaders, but it was I, r/destiny2!
---
Did you not see the size of my shoulder pads? They're like so big.
---
They just vibin tho
---
Ok

For those people defending Destiny 2‚Äôs pvp you obviously haven‚Äôt played enough of it. With the amount of broken guns in pvp (for example Recluse, Lord of Wolfs, the Jotunn, Chaperone etc...) you never can seem to really catch a break. Want to have fun in pvp? Nope here comes a titan shotgun rushing you that really doesn‚Äôt even need a shotgun when he can one shot you with his melee and do it over and over with certain gear. I mean I absolutely enjoy pvp but when I play matches of lets say survival for example, as soon as you start the game and see a team full of titans with one eyed mask and any of those guns I mentioned above you realize immediately you lost. All the enemy team needs to have is a couple brain cells and you don‚Äôt even stand a chance unless your using some form of cheese or broken mechanic. I have friends that won‚Äôt even play pvp with me because of these things and it honestly sucks. All I wanna do is play with the boys but I can‚Äôt even do that Bc the mention of any of these guns or even seeing a titan in crucible gives them ptsd flashbacks of any past matches causing their butt holes to quiver. I still love the concept of pvp but the things that plague it really seem to make it unenjoyable. Plus it also sucks that my only real counter to the titan ordeal is sitting in a choke point with lord of wolfs and just wait for them to push me just so I can hope for a least a trade.

---
It depends on the weapons. Some are tied to quests, some are just randomly dropped as you play. 
---
I think near the top of the weapon description it will say where to get them, like earned in Gambit or Crucible and so on.
---
I read that it can drop from gunsmith engrams so if you have weapon parts to spare you could try that or you could buy legendary emgrams for glimmer from the cryptarch.
---
You didn't dismantle it, you unlocked it. Now that it's unlocked you can go to the armor and next to the shader is the ornament tab where you can apply it.
---
Which one?
---
That dude is just ass
---
You shouldn‚Äôt have. Good job
---
Are you sure you didn‚Äôt just take a shit,  cut it once and place a colored rock between the pieces?
---
I got this today in the ideal
---
Just proof that it was cancer before fortnite.
---
hey, looks like you're wrong. Vision of Confluence was one of the more popular endgame primaries.

Warlocks have the worst melee speed in the game and the same range as other classes. You do not main a warlock.
---
That's the fattest no u I've ever seen
---
You do what?  Have the quest?  Have Forsaken?  Do what? The mysterious box quest is no longer located in a cave.   So what box are you trying to open in Smidur Cave? 
---
If you have the quest already, you have to collect the keys from their various quest by unlocking them, then install them in the box.  There is a key in Volunder, Gofannan, and Izanami forges.  You have to complete the Izanami forge iginition questline to get the key mold for the final key to the box.
---
That sword name... what a mess.
---
They had the idea first, fortnite made it worse. Not saying i like fortnite, it is also bad
---
Absolutely! I‚Äôve recently been taking breaks if I lose 2 in a row because it‚Äôs easy to go on tilt in comp and that losing streak just destroys glory. It sucks playing for a few hours only to be exactly where you started (or worse lol). Definitely just take your time with the quest and play as smart as you can. Thanks man, hope to get there sooner than later
---
I couldn't see the player below his name thanks to that xD fun clanmates
---
So you‚Äôre being a shitty person and using other people‚Äôs shitty actions an excuse? Long story short, you‚Äôre just a shitty person.
---
Attunement of fission + contraverse hold + near max discipline punishes everything near you
---
Yep...
---
i always fight until the bitter end, never give up, never quit
---
That'll give me access to all the good gear for PvP and high tier content yeah?
---
Seems legit and likely represents 99% of the population...
---
Just do it with the Titan.
---
Hunters are easily startled? Bruh, I've been panicked killed by either Nova or Handheld Supernova more than anything in this game
---
Cross Save is for changing between consoles to PC or vice versus. To transfer your progress from BattleNet to Steam you want to [head here](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/PCMove).
---
Ok, thanks, very cool.  Thought I skipped the leveling stuff, and I love the leveling stuff!
---
Warlock melee ain‚Äôt even that good
---
Gambit is fine. Played a ton last night, had a great time.üëç
---
Haha that's rad.
---
D2checklist.com can (among many other things) show what Powerful drops you have yet to complete for the week and how much each should grant. There are multiple Tiers of drop now, some +1/+2 range, some more.
---
Also, if you want to get really tedious you can check vendorengrams.xyz and every time you get a drop you can buy armor from whichever vendor is currently selling *at level* engrams. 
---
So say 923 boots drop, go buy 923 everything else so no matter what slot it lands in your next Powerful drop actually adds to your overall Power, rinse repeat ad infinitum.
---
I know I just wish I saw more primary fights Bc I feel like I‚Äôm wasting my time trying to really only use them and only using special when I have to :/
---
ok thanks
---
OP's probably a titan main and is mad how Contraverse punishes Fusion Rifles, Shotties and Shoulder Charges.
---
Tbh I love the fact that Shaxx goes insane. It hypes me up even more.
---
Exactly what I was thinking
---
Wut?
---
Reply:
---
1. Don't do the bounty if you don't want to use the loadout - but variation can be fun. Get out of your comfort zone
---
2. No. This keeps you from running into match after match against recluse/mountain top/jotuun.  Makes the games more varied and gives you something to work for.  Also keeps players engaged longer.
---
3. You can kill recluse wielders with many, many different loadouts.  I was out SMG'ng recluse guys left and right with Unburdened Hero.
---
4. If you don't like it, you don't have to play it.
---
5. wait, isn't this the same as 2?
---
Long and short of it is this, if you don't enjoy the mode, don't play it.  I have been having a blast with it and enjoyed being forced to run weapons I normally don't.  I got through the quest chain pretty quickly and have been getting so much loot I don't know what to do with it all half the time.  The armor has consistently dropped with higher base stats than any other armor I have come across so far - which makes running even after completing the bounties worth it.
---
no I mean where can they be dropped
---
Beautiful work!
---
I actually want to raid now.
---
Great guns and pinnacle armour.
---
Those count as drops. Otherwise good luck with world drops.
---
You're ***
---
Hawthorne is way cooler than Ikora
---
Wins are at 73% and I'm getting pretty burned out, just getting to Fabled 1 hasn't been easy for me at all (solo)
---
I love it.  Makes my pluperfect/whatever and Cerebus+1/subtle calamity loadouts so much fun - especially when staying just out of their optimal range.
---
Now get Luna's Howl or Not Forgotten, Mountaintop, Revoker, and Randy's Throwing Knife. Then we'll talk.
---
Jokes aside, good job!
---
Just a thought, maybe add Mr. Toland somewhere? XD
---
Switch character, or quit to title screen and go back in. The game seems to have trouble noticing that you've completed it, and that seems to jump start it.
---
Oh yeah, I might find a space to put him floating around. thanks!
---
Thanks I‚Äôm working on all of them now plus I have revoker
---
Just so you know, any quest that lets linear fusion rifles count will actually say using "linear fusion rifles"
---
Half your comment is censored brother
---
All I want is a new armor set for vanguard and the crucible and maybe one new weapon for each. That‚Äôs the minimum I could ask for personally. Not a new pinnacle or ritual weapon either, I mean a world drop weapon
---
Stuff of myth have 2 requirements, first is getting to fabled (2100 glory points), 
---
second is to fill the progress bar to 100% (1 valor wins = 1%, 1 glory wins = 3%, 1 Iron Banner wins = 5% )
---
I'm convinced it should've been the crossed swords emote.
---
meanwhile ive been playing since d1 and have never gotten anything from shaxx beyond a 'well done hunter' in the most calm ass voice ever even while on 5-10 kill streaks
---
You just have to get fabled 1. As mentioned above switch your character or log out then back in. It should recognize it then
---
Most of the weapons and armour are clones of somrthing else aren't they?
---
Kill your parents first
---
The only three maps IB ran for the first few days was Widows Court, Fragmentation, and Twilight Gap
---
No
---
10+ exotics since the season started and I don't have it yet! Yay!
---
Yh but that's a very specific build, it's not bad, it's just not a personal favourite of mine.
---
I mean, unless you‚Äôre at the cap there‚Äôs always going to be *someone* out there that has an advantage over you. Most people that I‚Äôve been playing against are around the 930 power range. But every so often there‚Äôll be a 960 at the power cap that (at around 940) I‚Äôll have to melee four times to kill. 
---
The differences start to become noticeable when playing against someone 6-10 levels higher and very significant when it‚Äôs above that. Just be at least above 925 and you *should* be OK. I recommend probably 935 if possible. The levels make a difference.
---
Hey that worked thank god I don't think I can handle anymore Survival. Thank you.
---
dude way inappropriate. the above is stealing art, reposting it, and not crediting the original creator- let alone even asking them if you could repost.
---
the original creator's post is [HERE](https://snowing-in-cyberspace.tumblr.com/post/166898632245/an-easy-to-use-guide-to-the-destiny-boys). the destiny fanbase should be above this sorta behavior.
---
3.7k upvotes and that could've been bringing very necessary and important views to the rest of the artist's work (which includes some cute halo characters in the same style) but instead you decide play the fool. disappointing.
---
Ok so can't advance till tomorrow sadly
---
Thanks for the help
---
It is very nice.  Range isn't what you would think, but it is fun to use...and the model is beautiful.
---
Both still cost money I believe? Forsaken is 19.99, and I believe the other is 24.99 or 29.99.
---
Thanks :)1
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs why I added the Login button below the search bar. It‚Äôll show a ‚ÄúMy Profile‚Äù link after you authenticate with Bungie.
---
No, you should go do freelance if you aren't already and use the vigilance wing as your primary weapon.
---
OP: Crucible is full of insane pedants.
---
D2 Sub: Hold my beer.
---
I got insanely lucky, i got it from a season pass exotic engram, i opened all 3 random ones from the pass and got a new one each time
---
&gt;scared warlock noises&lt;
---
Chances are neither were communicating.
---
If you do "In pursuit of Honour" for mountain top, it may also require the same jump start.
---
Yeah it's amazing!
---
They were final blows. I was tracking it through d2 checklist. Also was using jade rabbit and didn‚Äôt have the catalyst unlocked so I was working toward it. That also doesn‚Äôt explain the medals and completed matches.
---
Right, a lot of people always use special whenever they have it. Just play long range away from the fusions and shotguns if possible and gun them down. Typically snipers can‚Äôt touch you in this meta because of the hard flinch they get from all of the pulses and scouts.
---
You gotta have all the perks on the bottom unlocked
---
Hive-agina cannot be replaced
---
I thought I'd return the favor but I cede you that one.
---
You try sniping in this game?
---
Why you no wait for reset?
---
Are you sure about that?  Have you run the matches with a full set of IB armor for the triumph?
---
Yeah I do, it‚Äôs masterworked now and still not dropped
---
I looked wrong my bad srr
---
who deserves credit is the artist: [snowing-in-cyberspace](https://snowing-in-cyberspace.tumblr.com/post/166898632245/an-easy-to-use-guide-to-the-destiny-boys) :)  
---
not the op here on reddit who stole and reposted.
---
I like more having a fusion or a shotty than the recluse
---
Yeah not sure man I haven‚Äôt had the issue, the only thing I could have thought would be if they weren‚Äôt final blows which happens.
---
This is a joke about reskins right? 
---
If not I hate to break it to you, but that's a previous event's armor set.
---
I dunno but it seems both of you are pretty toxic to me.
---
I was blind and looked at the wrong one my bad!
---
Lol I do not understand why this comment got deleted but ok
---
Well no, they have two great shutdown supers and one of the easiest supers to use in the game. I love using tickle fingers after some drinking, you can just look in the general direction of enemies and kill them!
---
I have played all classes a bit, and the Hunter has the highest skill ceiling. As in a good player will be even better taking advantage of the perks the class has. But if you aren't hitting every shot, you will easily get shut down. Same can't be said of the other classes.
---
So no, absolutely do not buff Warlocks and Warlocks alone!
---
I understand trying to stay out of their range but the problem is I‚Äôm trying to play with some 150 handcannons so it‚Äôs pretty easy for multiple of them to close the gap
---
Phoenix Protocol and Stormdancer‚Äôs Brace are two popular and solid options for exotics. If you‚Äôre talking about legendaries... well they‚Äôre all the same.
---
I changed it. Then it got deleted
---
Sadly I dislike pulses and scouts so I‚Äôve been trying to mess around with some 140s and 150s handcannons
---
I haven't found the third one over there either.  Looked for it for quite a while one night and just gave up.
---
ask the real artist! (the op of this reddit post stole and reposted) you can ask the real artist on their tumblr: [snowing-in-cyberspace](https://snowing-in-cyberspace.tumblr.com/post/166898632245/an-easy-to-use-guide-to-the-destiny-boys)
---
I used it with chap every now and again. Mostly if I was on my hunter just to mess around with way of the wraith.
---
Ive showed every single person I play Destiny with this... So my girlfriend. Still, this is the epicest of fails!
---
My pappy used to say if your gonna fuck it up at least make em wonder how you did it.
---
Devrim
---
Turns heroic? What do you mean
---
Ok, well if it's any consolation as a titan my grenades feel underpowered now too.
---
everything else is good though
---
\*Accidentally charges into me\*
---
Gotta love the Titans.
---
Stupid question but how would I go about getting exotics in the first place . I haven't managed to find any anywhere . They haven't been dropped , rewarded from looking , nothing.  Any help would be very useful
---
Is that rapid hit or ambitious assassin? Can‚Äôt really tell.
---
If it‚Äôs rapid hit, bravo. Probably the best gun in the game.
---
Maybe some kind of unholy plague could bring good old days back
---
And people complain about titans. That looks like a lot of fun though.
---
Lol!!  Looks like my MT grind!!
---
Hong Kong?
---
i‚Äôve just re-authenticated it, so i guess just accept it again?
---
Yeah. You never know. The mods might ban me from this channel.
---
Oh shit really?
---
Not there.
---
Yeah
---
Playing as a titan means you accept that you need an op class to be good at the game
---
That's what mine did, but mine is habitually more glitchy and nonsensical so take it with a grain of salt
---
Yeah idk what it is about Titans but sometimes the melee me and get an blue shield and to me as a Hunter I can't even do anything about it I just have no choice but to die lmao
---
Thank you
---
I wish I had J√∂tunn .*sighs angrily*
---
Unstoppable force meets immovable object
---
i‚Äôve kinda got no other option but to accept it, currently waiting for it to load
---
Do you mean cost of armour energy or is someone actually selling the mod?
---
I usually just throw it at solos because I very rarely see any groups when I‚Äôm playing and there‚Äôs no point holding a super the whole match.
---
That doesn‚Äôt explain anything but ok bro üòÇ
---
*angry hunter main noises intensify*
---
I have a feeling by the time I get it, it‚Äôll be nerfed again...
---
To be honest I can get any exotic beside raid exotics I have watched my friend get 1k 3 times when I‚Äôm with him.
---
yeah, the vigilance wing buffs you when your team-mates die, you become a super accurate and fast healing god when the rest of your team has been eliminated.
---
There are certain specific quests that drop some of them, but most of them will come from Xur(weekly vendor that comes on Friday, sells exotics for Legendary Shards), and random drops.
---
That's exactly what I screamed when I saw this üòÇ
---
Not having my helmet on means my hunter can't have his hood up.
---
Stop asking questions. Sound like a true nosy warlock. that's why i made my warlock a snitch in the drifter season
---
Luna's haunted
---
I AM THE 1% and boy does is SUCK .
---
Detained from who or where?
---
I hate how they have removed levelling. I don‚Äôt want to start the game with every ability and subclass unlocked, I don‚Äôt want to be high power level. I never completed destiny 2 when I first played it years ago but I had a great time levelling  up and playing through the campaign. Now it just feels boring, what‚Äôs the point in doing the original campaign now? Is there anyway I can just start fresh and slowly enjoy the game?
---
What just happened lol !? Jesus !
---
As far as i know the heroic versions only show up when that planet is the flashpoint.
---
But just to be sure chech with brother vance, he may have them on one of his pages.
---
Worse.........
---
That‚Äôs true!
---
Haven‚Äôt quite decided yet if I like the ship enough to go for it yet. 
---
I got the ship for the whisper catalyst quest so I feel like I‚Äôm set, haha.
---
Alright man . Thanks for the help . Very much appreciated for a new player.
---
I‚Äôm still stuck on rapid kills
---
The helmet stayed on
---
This is why i just bank all of my exotics.
---
How did you get the enemy POV?!
---
I could be wrong but i think it depends on how well you did in the match
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat. Got 4 armor mods from Saladin and can‚Äôt find them anywhere
---
returning mail to the sender, Titan style.
---
I think the main difference is that this requires you to get two melee kills before it one hits.
---
I had sooo much trouble with that one. If you play comp you get like 10% (cuz its Survival) if you get double kills. I used colony and tried getting heavy as much as possible. I was stuck at 95% for like 2 days, finally got it now.
---
Idk what else there is to explain dude, i've put in 125 hours into D2 in 12 days, mostly Vex Offensive and bounties, i did a shit ton of Vex bounties and i also did the raid a few times
---
