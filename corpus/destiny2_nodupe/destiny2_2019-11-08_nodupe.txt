Why were you even bothering? That terror is literally unkillable.
---
---
---
Good luck man I’m working on my flawless completion now I know I can solo it. I’d honestly suggest trying to use a warlock if you can because it’s difficult on a hunter for sure but if you can do it on a hunter then power to you man
---
Zavala's Tiny PP shall RIDE AGAIN
---
‘Tis but a scratch.
---
Hit me again daddy... 😆😆
---
I literally don't see any Pikes in tangled shore...anywhere
---
Hmm, you have no idea why it's not showing up for me? I see Titan but no indicator of Flashpoint happening there.
---
Now make a titan one where the background is drawn in crayon.
---
I had 3 tests during this week and all I wanted to do was grind my levels for the season pass
---
There should be a yellow icon above Titan this week.
---

---
Unless I'm mistaken, you can still get heroic adventures directly from Brother Vance as well.
---
Just got last word today after some great survival win streaks. Such a cool gun, I had no idea it was full auto and the animations are badass
---
There’s no such thing as warlock jump only warlock float
---
The rings a bell but can't remember myself so lol
---
[removed]
---
It's more of a subie rather than an evo. Also, it's a hatch so I have more room to fit titan memes.
---
Does Sloane have a gold border? If not have you done some public events, lost sectors, or adventures on titan since tuesady?
---
Are you in iron banner? If so, what's your Light level?
---
Is this a joke?
---
Everyone recluse is the same. Unless u are playing iron banner, recluse is strong when u proc it's buff if you are having troubling getting that first frag then the issue isn't the gun.
---
Ah so there is a lore reason for the change in look
---
[deleted]
---
You can't anymore, but I think huckleberry can be obtained from any planet's heroic adventures.
---
Oh, yea I think you have to spend 5$ in the steam store. If there are any games around that price that you are interested in go for one of those. If you haven’t ever played and you have some friends who are also interested Magica is a pretty good game.
---
T‘is but a scratch!
---
When I thought of this post, yes I was in iron banner. My light is 956.
---
Yeah man I reckon I can solo it too but it’s just the matter of flawless, aye I have a warlock and Titan at 960-965ish so it’s possible but lack a lot of exotics for both
---
And you know that level is turned on in iron banner, right?
---
It's been awhile since I played Gambit. Once I got Breakneck I stopped.
---
I feel offended. I just always wanna be the tank/the mental guy running into battle with a hammer while eveyone else is using guns
---
How does one get to that light level?
---
ah yes, thank you
---
That's a fair point, didn't think about that...
---
Can confirm, have tested: Yes, it is safe.
---
Looks accurate, still can’t put a shader on it !
---
This is not the combination of fruitless bounties, this is Destiny.
---
Got one today hope i didint put it parts. Its hard to keep up whats good or not in this game.
---
Bottom tree is just. Garbage. Itll be even worse when arc battery is gone
---
I think it failed you either because you moved while shooting, or because you shot the enemy after shooting his gun. First time I did this, I didn't know to shoot his gun and when I hit his body got gibbed like in this clip.
---
Aight thanks
---
2 seconds after the gate lights up we see our future selves stroll out wearing future sunglasses. They spot us and yell, "get in loser, we need to save Cayde". Fun fact about the Vex tech: not as intuitive as you might think. You pause a moment before stepping through, because whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold.
---
What material(s) did you use? Besides ahamkara bones
---
I want this so bad now.
---
That also happened to my fire team today, but we only did the first encounter and secret chest before quitting(thankfully I already grabbed it on Tuesday)
---
So anybody remember that Ikora is a thanatonaut? What if she alone saw a vision of something great dealing with the Vex Gate that no one believes but no one will question because she is the best thanatonaut next to Osiris? I can’t wait to power that mofo up.
---
I'd work on getting to max light. The powerfuls just aren't going to be worth it for the struggle at your current light.
---
It’s memes bro, relax.
---
oxygen is very mediocre imho, but you are also likely to get it naturally
---
I’ve got my buddy from the vault to the soccer field in the hanger one. All I felt was pride
---
I was under the impression that that was how you got the mysterious box, but I already had it until last night. Not sure how I got it, though. This quest has just been a frustrating experience overall lol.
---
In case people wonder how to get this high; There's people at &gt;1100..
---
yeah but my issue was the game wouldnt give me a key mold
---
I got anarchy the same way
---
Lol. Says a free code, not the replica.
---
Not just 800, &gt;1100.
---
That's how you make shaxx proud
---
Gear dropped by season pass perks only drops at 750.
---
3D printed?
---
Indeed
---
The 2 with the concetrated mind happened in order same run, then the one with the final boss happened on a different one, and about the blade barrage idk but we 1 phased him after we wiped because with the boss telepoted he was already moving to spit his overflow out so we were a good mile away
---
Those are bonus drops from your Season Pass.
---
I mean, I'm all for helping but there ain't exactly a lot any of us can do. Kicking down the door of some random guy's house demanding the account to be set free is the best I've got
---
alright
---
That would be cool and maybe possible if the hive weren't so messed up.
---
Hahaha I play PVP and I still haven't finished redrix.. keep missing the 5 Valor resets because I'm lazy. But this is my season. Got 3 done and will knock another one off this weekend gives me the rest of the season.
---
Congratulations on the 20 bomb.  Shaxx should be proud.
---
I mean, the limit was 50 not long ago, so i’ll take the 63. :D
---
Moon’s joe
---
I feel like if they did this, they would be having Ikora mention cayde more.
---
Because there won’t be enough players for any forge but bergusia if they didn’t rotate daily
---
Would go well with the ghost I recently finished, good stuff!
---
Looks like it is the amount of PvP matches played (probably since Shadowkeep's release)
---
Respect my safe space guardians!!
---
To be fair, peter dinklage didny really make a convincing ghost, great actor but shite machine.
---
I think my first D1 exotic was Red Death. I had no clue if it was any good. My first D2 exotic was either Rat King or Sweet Business. I miss some of the unique exotics of D1.
---
it says i need progress on shadowkeep to get bounties from eris, do i have to do the full campain?
---
Yeah, with a group of 8+ enemies it will only give back a third at most.  It's disappointing since it was the only thing that made Devourlock Nova Bomb good (my favorite super and also admittedly the worst).  Any exotic that only activates during a super is hard to balance since there's nothing stopping players from switching on and off of it when their super is ready or has been used.
---
I try to get people to push B point but I always end up alone, but I usually survive that encounter, shout out to Recluse proc and Revoker
---
Fill your missions up from shaxx!! Easy leveling as well.
---
That means nothing if half your team is doing it, and then halfway through capturing the point everyone else leaves and you're just sitting there.
---
Oh fuck. Oh shit. Oh fuck oh shit oh GOOOOOOD THEY'RE OUT OF THE GAME! HOW ELSE DID HE GET THE BONE TO MAKE THAT HELMET!?!?
---
Oem/recluse/mountaintop/titan melee... how much help you need? How can you sleep at night? That being said, I totally get it, I use the recluse and would love for my hunter to have a one hit melee. If it’s in the game, it’s fair game. People just don’t like when they get killed.
---
I don't know why you would really need more than this.  Pick up as many bounties as you can for the activities you're going to do (Crucible, Gambit, or PvE).  I do PvE.  I drop to the Tower to pick up anything from Eva, Zavala, Banshee, Ikora, Drifter, and Ada that I can.  Then I go to the Moon to pick up anything I can from the Cryptoglyph table.  Finally, I head to wherever I can to get as many of those bounties done as possible in the shortest amount of time, picking up destination bounties as I go.  Usually, that means planets with Vex Lost Sectors using weapons to complete the Gunsmith and Ada bounties.
---
Literally... Bounties, bounties, bounties.
---
I'm not sure, but I will say that it doesn't take too long to finish the story for it.
---
I will pay for this to be a feature
---
This is 100% just Inosuke but with a badass mech helmet
---
I’m not allowed to have random exotics anymore. I got a jade rabbit and Orpheus Rig randomly. Can’t remember where I got the rabbit but I remember I got the Orpheus after a game of control. Wild
---
But what if at that point, the Ghost is *just* a sentient robot, and not a harbinger of the light? Would they be capable of replicating the technology perfectly I wonder. I don't see why not, and if it's perfectly recreated just without the spark of Light, I suppose we can't really say for sure either way if simulated Sundance would be able to reconnect to the light. 
---
However I just want to point out it seems like the vex can actually simulate guardians ghosts reviving them, which is a huge step forward as it indicates they are developing a means to somewhat begin to simulate minute amounts of the lights paracausal existence. I mean, they did actually succeed in tuning into the light frequency of Saint-14, albeit after an exceedingly long period of time. I wonder if that could have given them some knowledge into the light. 
---
I have a hypothesis that the light actually has to bind somewhat to our causal universe in order to interact with it. Meaning that eventually through long enough study, it can be understood by naturalistic means, of which the vex appear to be inextricably bound.
---
He plays bounty simulator
---
I don’t have any feedback but damn that is good
---
Shader
---
so the moon is the best place to farm, i should buy the random ones and get the normal ones and just keep running lost sectors?
---
Do you have any tips on playing aggro as a hunter? I feel like I can't counter anything.
---
Not nice.
---
As if a titan would emphasise fashion over crayon eating!
---
I cant agree anymore.
---
Are you on PC dude? We should play
---
one time way back in d1 i was in this group doing crotas end, and one of the final hallways til the bossroom, a teammate went afk, so then the 5 of us spend the next like 10 minutes pushing him and meleeing him AAAALLLLLLL the way down the hallways and up the stairs and through the rooms onto the crystal, where he finally came back so we could start the last encounter
---
Pretty sure you get progress from kills with void weapons as well? I haven’t got a single kills on hand cannons yet I’m sitting on 43% lol  recluse )
---
Nah. He's just trying to farm karma.
---
You have to proc master of arms first for your recluse to do some serious damage. It’s still good without it proc’d but you will always lose a 1v1 versus a master of arms recluse cause the damage is significantly higher.
---
That was the fastest progress I've had. If you have other activities to do, grab bounties for those. Grab as many strike bounties if you're going there, or crucible bounties for crucible, etc. But if you just want to grind season pass, lunar bounties was the fastest I've seen personally
---
Jotunn, telesto, erentil
---
Same but got Monte Carlo and I literally wished for it prior too... Then I wanted more.......!!!
---
The current Iron banner armour is pretty cool looking, black armoury sets (both forge and raid sets) loo dope too, the raid set especially.
---
Yeah I agree 100%. I guess people are happy to only achieve so much in life lol
---
Same granted I have never finished lw
---
“Any last words?”
---
Just got the Thunderlord today! Dropped from the season pass exotic engram for leveling up.
---
Some people are better playing at a distance. My best advice would be find some weapons you like and learn to bait people. That really changed the game for me. 
---
You can look up tons of helpful tips and tricks on YouTube. Also don't be afraid to ask for tips from people who play crucible a lot.
---
back in d1 i found out about xur, found out he was selling icebreaker, found out what icebreaker was, and spent the next like dozen or so hours grinding strange coins (i wasnt in a good place to do the nightfall alot, sue me) and it was my first exotic, and i used that fucker for most of the rest of destiny. i can still hear the sound of it firing, god i miss that gun
---
we still need a cabal themed dlc (apart from the red war)
---
How? I’m new to destiny. Been playing a month and am only 933 and 43 on season pass
---
*"wait a minute. Who. Are you?"*
---
Well there are the thanatonauts. A cult of guardians who commit suicide regularly to try and see if they can remember the afterlife before they rez. Could see a splinter sect forming off them like that.
---
Okay that doesn't seem too bad but do you think it's still worth it or are there better options in your opinion
---
im curious, when are you usually on?
---
Yep, unless they add them to Eververse, they will most likely be gone if you didn't get it.
---
 . .l
---
Arsenic bite or Calamity
---
I live in Japan so it’s usually night time for Americans or afternoon for Europeans
---
*loads Thunderlord with deadly intent*
---
Shouldn't you be ironing your mom's clothes?
---
That frame plays a mean ass keyboard ngl
---
I've been grinding through exotic quests because I can't get enough, through some of the missions I've had to play, I've gotten four or five random drops, three armor and two guns, Crimson and Suros
---
That reminds me of the bifrost
---
Damn, I got to gotta pump my game up
---
What variant is the second one down to the right?
---
That wouldn't matter. The vex could attack the last city at any time they want, but they choose not to. Whenever they run simulations of attacking the last city and driving the guardians into a corner, they can never account for what the light might do. The furthest they've simulated the light is someone being revived by their ghost, but that took a very long time to accomplish
---
It seems that the calamity now is the only one I can get. Thanks
---
Noice
---
You can also push them up a box and over the edge by shaxx
---
Suros regime is pure trash
---
Tl;dr, Efriyeet threw Saladin 20km as a railgunned solar round. Her arc plus his solar obliterated a Fallen raiding force. He had to go get rezzed after that.
---
Skill lvl 0? How do u check that?
---
Well now I'm stuck with failsafe as my inner voice for the night, thanks for that.
---
Or if you're my bf, you're riding your sparrow into them and yeeting them.
---
But no fun allowed?
---
So I guess I just have to hope they re-release the Faction Rallies, then?
---
Hammer looks like an axe, but it kind of looks cooler
---
Kinda looks like Exit Strategy
---
Word of advice, do as many bounties as you can.  Bounties give a shitton of EXP.  Pick up all the bounties you can anytime you do anything really.  Every planet, except for dreaming city, Tangled shore, and the moon, all have 3 bounties that take about 5-15 minutes to do all of them.  Each set of 3 gives about a 20-35% of your EXP bar for a level up.  The others have more, but usually take longer to do them.
---
Maybe it'll be like the Forever War and bringing Cayde-6 back through a Vex gate will allow him to understand the Vex the same way humans came to understand the aliens they had fought for centuries after they started cloning themselves and the Vex will simply no longer be enemies. There are tangential similarities between Vex troops and Exos, as both are militaristic manifestations of species that originated as largely fluid-based lifeforms. Cayde may wind up being the catalyst that allows the Vex to understand humanity and the Light and quit seeing them as something to be conquered through simulated study with the intent of totalitarian mastery.
---
r/DestinySherpa or r/Fireteams
---
I went in at 910 and did quite good, 67 kills, 13 guardian kills, and over all we killed the primeval and won. i also got a pretty good bygones from it.
---
Are you on psn
---
None cuz Cayde is dayde
---
I love replying with something insanely stupid, usually they stop replying right away but I just die laughing at the things I tell some people
---
Yep
---
How do I unlock invisibility
---
Come on. Really?
---
😁
---
Everything that says „Pinnacle Gear“ in the director, IB Bounties are 4 this week per character as well which you shouldn’t miss.
---
Else the 100k nightfall is a good source as it can be done in the 920 Ordeal this week which has matchmaking, same for the Haunted Forest. The dungeon, 980 Nightmare Hunts and the raid usually require a fireteam for non-pve legends
---
Can't go wrong with Meatllica M.o.P
---
Is the haunted forest unlimited?
---
Still no flag though, we’ve defo never landed there. ;)
---
I might have found a fix. I don’t know. Basically what happened for me is I had the mold on my warlock but play hunter main. Discarded the key mold and then spoke with ada, nothing. Walked to bergusia by foot and just explored Niobe labs. I logged off for a couple of hours and came back and ADA gave it to me again. I have no idea what for sure triggered it but yeah
---
Do you have forsaken expansion? That's what allows you to access all three subclass trees. If so, as a nightstalker you will turn invisible when you pop your super.
---
Probably trying to get the ability kills for the Arsenal of Tricks Bounty
---
I can’t feel my arms....
---
Is invisible super good for pvp
---
Playing non stop, doing lots of bounties and specific activities. I’m 966 and have 140 pass ranks
---
How? Liars handshake?
---
Once per week per char.
---
Reminds me of the funeral scene in the Watchmen movie. Hello darkness my old friend.
---
I definitely need to burn that thing to ash
---
What? Someone hangs back and doesn’t help?
---
Im using bow + eriana + lucky pants...oems fear me
---
I can see where you’re coming from with that last statement, but just in general the destiny community doesn’t want to improve they get the gun and get out by any means possible.
---
So much for dlc world drops.
---
Not yet, wait another 10hrs or so.
---
Go into momentum with colony, grab power and hide, they dont got radar, wait till they cap a zone and spam it.
---
Group of certain classes. Thanatology faction who likes to die to explore it. I can’t remember their names.
---
This guy Regimes
---
Forgot to mention this:
---
We had izanagis + catalyst 
---
Well of radiance 
---
Bubble 
---
Oppressive darkness
---
What Star Wars movie is this, the final fight looks great
---
https://whereisxur.com
---
Ah so there is still a chance of getting it then.
---
The helmet is the Skerren Corvus Mask (last Halloween event armor). 
---
The arms are the exotic Sealed Ahamkaras Grasps
---
 The chest and legst could be anything with the seasonal ornaments on.
---
Not sure about the cape, but I think it is also the seasonal ornament since there is no hood.
---
I get mountaintop and a heavy GL, why lion too?
---
In my time which i think EST or GMT, Xür comes at 9 pm
---
Thanks
---
Oh didn't even realise that there was seasonal ornaments there, shows how much love my hunters gotten lately lol.
---
Broodhold worked. Thanks
---
Worked. Ty
---
No worries man, sometimes quests/bounties just don't work the way they should.
---
Yeah it’s been happening to me as well. Just with this update
---
Yup, it's all RNG
---
Then I honestly have no clue how you managed to do so little damage since my friends and I running the exact same combo were able to do over 50% health in one phase
---
MT for yellowbars, Lion for trash mobs, and Wendigo for DPS
---
Enhanced sniper doesn't come from banshee tho
---
Tell qbout it. I would really like to get the ornaments, but I'm seriously lacking the motivation to play the game.
---
Alright thanks for the info!
---
With 2 people?
---
These are team co-op modes. If you choose not to have a team, that’s on you. You have just as much opportunity as anyone else to find a team. It’s fair.
---
Yeah I'm feeling that, especially with how many exotics/exotic quests have been screwy lately *cough cough* Izanagi *cough cough*
---
He’s at google.com
---
Ah, sorry I'm a dummy, I meant the one second down to the left. It does not look familiar at all, where they the ones in D1? I haven't played D1.
---
Oh lmao didn’t see it was a two man. In that case, trying to run a raid boss with only 2 guys and running into problems isn’t cause to begin demanding the game make your raid attempts (which you yourself made harder by only having 2) easier when you should just try running with more people
---
Never coming back. Too few players participated to justify the dev time.
---
I hope they can fix that as soon as possible
---
Du brauchst erst den Katalysator, der kann am Ende von Strikes und Schmelztiegel Matches droppen, die Chance dass du genau den Kat bekommst den du willst sind leider eher gering. Wenn du den Katalysator dann in die Waffe gesetzt hast, zeigt er dir auch genau an wie viele kills du bereits hast, bzw noch brauchst.
---
i've actually had different experiences in different classes: on my warlock i don't encounter nearly as many of them as on my hunter for some reason. might just be coincidence. also recluse isn't that bad anymore. mountaintop is, but i can easily outrange a recluse with my good ol' austringer. if i can give you any advice: play distance. play pulses or snipers (if you have the aim for that), use the map around you, never get into a fair fight. try to catch people out of cover and always watch that u can get behind an obstacle to break the line of sight, should you need to. radar and map awareness are your friend.
---
also, there's a reason people call pulses "dad weapons" : they're a damn effective counter to that aping bs if you stay at range, and they hate that they can't have it their way. i usually run claws of the wolf and austringer or last word for close to mid close range flexibility. last word is still a beast.
---
HAPPY CAKE DAY
---
This damn bounty is the reason of so many losses.   
---
I don't give a damn about this bounty, but my teammates constantly run past the bank with 14 motes to collect this last one. Instead of summoning the boss.
---
Bungie never learn and keep making bounties which hinder the teamplay and make teammates compete with each other.
---
"Let's go!  He can't kill all of us!"
---
"I absolutely can kill all of you"
---
No it isn’t. Outlaw is faster. Yeah, it takes a crit kill but...you’re supposed to. Shoot better to work better.
---
ZA WARUDO!!!
---
BBFFFFFFFFFTT
---
Might I also add I've been trying to get that line to trigger in game, and I love Drifter to pieces &lt;33333333
---
Mine changes all the time depending on how I feel but right now I'm using SMG in the energy slot and if its a wide open map I use pulse in the kinectic and on tighter maps shotty and grenade launcher with proximity mines.
---
Ah, right, because that's what we aim for, that's what we live for — to be "fun" at some hypothetical party.

I’m not an artists, but I would say try and copy this but make the drawing twice or 3 times a big, then you can add more detail.

Theres not enough in it. Ask anyone and they will tell you FF is better dude.
---
It’s a triumph that requires fabled in comp(glory rank) and wins I’m not sure on how many tho
---
Did my other comment answer your question?
---
that chestpiece that refills auto rifles as you hold them, and then you empty most of your mag before you engage. so you get the bonus damage and it refills while you fire so its like a full mag of boosted damage
---
Dim is 10 times better in Browser than Companion app.
---
Not playing much Gambit. But Toaster(Jotun) is awesome. Blockers? Gone. High Value Target? Gone. Invader? Depends, but usually it's a trade. I expose myself to setup a shot, die and he eats fireball.
---
Heavy Grenade Launcher for Boss.
---
And whatever primary to clean up "red bars".
---
another tip (took me a while to realise it) when you use the unstoppable mod, you have to aim for a couple of seconds for the perk to activate
---
Ja ist egal, ist komplett random, egal ob 980er Dämmerung oder ganz normale strike playlist
---
Momentum control+jade rabbit=1shot headshot.
---
Have fun
---
It's SBMM.  If you generally have a 3.0+ then you either haven't played very much or you've worked your way up to playing with the very best now and are still dominating.
---
...or, and this is most likely, you're exaggerating A LOT and shouldn't be paid much attention to...
---
The game refers to each weapon's archetype (within its weapontype) as a frame. They're basically saying anything with a High-Impact Frame will do the job. The frame is the furthest left slot on the Weapon Perk screen, it's how people compare weapons and what defines their usage. 67 Impact is actually what a High-Impact Scout will generally have and be 150RPM.
---
It's probably a tactics thing. People who are good with scout rifles always put themselves in positions where they can make shots. It sounds like you do that only part of the time.
---
A thing about aim that people don't understand is the tactical part-- many shots are far easier to make than others.
---
I would say to fall back more often. Try to feel it when your position is compromised and you're going to miss shots.
---
Any high impact scout kills in 1 headshot in momentum control, easiest method, but you will have other people pointing scouts at you so don't just stand there.
---
I've had it I can use them to buy upgrade modules. It seems to change each time I visit him what kind of items I need to buy one.
---
Is that group here on reddit or a website? Any chance to give the source?
---
While it's good to see peoe support bungie I think that's a bit overpriced for a dam piece of foam
---
Holy shit I remember when it looked this way
---
Not even at the start of the game but anytime. Send out a blocker or don't bank at all. Those people that deposit 4, 9 and 14 motes deserve a kick in the d*ck.
---
I want backup plan and rangefinder if it’s possible but I would never use it I would just like to brag
---
What. Glitche
---
I only know who Marty Robins is due to playing fallout new vegas
---
Back in my day this was how it always was.
---
All shotguns, snipers and fusions went into the heavy slot in D2Y1. You had to get heavy ammo to use any weapon that was a one hit.
---
Amazing matches tbh I miss it a lot.
---
Yeah, we also make bjg bubbles to sit it
---
Yeah, I was there for that too. I thought this was how it was back then but I wasn't certain. It was good except for the like, weird demand for teamwork at all times.
---
Looks like......
---
...It's starting to rain.
---
After shadowkeep, Monte has been propably my most used weapon overall. Great in PvE (Especially with a Greaves titan) and suprisingly good in PvP also.
---
I misunderstood your title at first, haha. I thought it was going to be file footage of the person who invented sparrows taking the prototype for a test drive.
---
You can do the same with warlock handheld super nova and web nades and much more consistently. This is something that even going for primarily shoulder bash kills you will hardly see happen. Hunters have the ability called being able to dodge and become almost immune to the hit (Not 100% since P2P is bullshit and sometimes it bypasses the hit resistance of the dodge). You also have jumps that can launch you much faster than any other class in order to evade faster even without your dodge. In mid-high level PvP shoulder charges are used almost entirely as a dodge mechanic since people know how to outplay it.
---
The only part that makes me not want to play it is when people feel that every time they get into a dual instead of a straight up fight they feel they have to jump 30 feet in the air and fight from the sky. I know it’s technically a strategy but in my opinion that’s pussy shit. Fight me straight up and stop your bunny hopping bullshit.
---
I see each downvote as a victory, a tick of cognitive dissonance that I've triggered in one of them.

Imagine being an asshole for no reason.
---
How are we supposed to finish challenges,bounties and wuests if we dont play it?
---
Only time it can be acceptable is if the enemy allready have a primevil and you got the needed number. However. That is my opinion.
---
Everything I look at has no reason for it.
---
Hunter also here. I agree, let us keep arc battery + Wormhusk and Titans can have their OEM! 
---
And yeah, there are a lot of options; weapons, armor and mods. People are just too hung up on certain builds to realise it.
---
As new player, what am I supposed to dps with? My machine gun has highest dps of my weapons.
---
Mine is nightstalker middle with le monarque in energy slot and oathkeepers. Usually run that with masterworked fine memorial and Breakneck/Blasphemer/One Small Step. 
---
Makes a change from running the recluse (which I am not knocking at all I love it but more on pve)
---
I just want an exotic sword that doesnt consume ammo when i dont hit anything... yes i am a warlock.
---
Yeah, little mad about that. Would have at least taken some effort.
---
I'm at 353 hours since steam D2 release, have not seen a single hacker in PvE.  Only hacking I see in crucible is potential aimbotting.  The only common issue I see is lag switching.
---
How can there be more than one, Agent Smith is The One
---
A green ball!!
---
Will try it out. Thanks
---
Pretty sure that machine guns were nerfed to do less damage to bosses, don’t remember the reason why though.
---
Saladan approves
---
I'm a bad PvP player on my way to get Randy's, so my advices aren't to be taken word for word at all, but I can share some tips that worked for me.
---
• The most scout rifle kills I have are from Momentum Control. I die to other scout rifles/grenade launchers a lot, but the "1 hit = 1 kill" helps rack up the kill numbers a lot. For that I use Jade Rabbit.
---
• In any other Crucible playlist I use a Night Watch with explosive payload. I hide a lot more and try not to engage people who are very close.
---
• In Iron Banner I look at the roster and try to identify enemies with lower light levels and focus my scout kills on them. I don't feel good doing it, but it gets me kills.
---
what about spectral hunters with arc battery wormhusk? or any dawnblade?
---
Use YouTube. I'm not clicking that.
---
Vibe Check
---
So you want even more rng in the game?
---
Nice
---
Golden gun is disgustingly good in pvp. The only thing you gotta watch out for is that you get no increased damage resistance like the other roaming supers.
---
I believe all exotic quests require purchasing the expansion in which they were introduced. So you need Forsaken in order to get the Izanagi’s Burden quest. It’s a little confusing since New Light players get access to some Forsaken activities, but I think exotic quests were one of the things Bungie states are tied to expansion purchase (campaigns, raids, and exotic quests are the headliners).
---
The Thanatonauts - Warlock Order
---
http://destiny.fandom.com/wiki/Thanatonaut
---
“They are known to kill themselves and gain knowledge before being revived by their ghosts.”
---
Figures. It’s an order for Thanos.
---
Wait a minute, did you even hit the very bottom of the pit?? (Havnt done the dungeon myself)
---
I’d hate to be in that group
---
Probably one of the best 1 shot drops with short time to kill. I only use Arbalyst. Have more videos coming up shortly...
---
Savathun: You fell for it fool! Thunder cross split attack!
---
I mean someone has to be the main character lol. I tend to ignore it due to the fact that everything legendary our guardian has done was 1, not alone and 2, thanks to very specific circumstances set up by things out of his control.
---
Canonically all raids are cleared by six people, but the other 5 big guardians are never talked about. Killing Crota was only.possible because Eris' fireteam failed, and Eris survived so she had invaluable intel, and due to Mara's planning on that whole assault, which carries onto Oryx, as the death of Crota made him make mistakes he wouldnt have otherwise, and the entire motion was set off due to Mara's plan to make Oryx do just that. The raid in the vault, the raid against Atheon, the raids on the leviathan, Riven and the garden, wasnt done by him alone.
---
Technically Ghaul was, but I did it with my friends so I did not fight him alone.  But yeah, I consciously ignore every reference to us being space jesus, and with that I also go by the thought that Shaxx could wipe the floor with us, as only Ikora can best him in a fight. The things we've done, likely couldbe been done by other very strong guardians once the right circumstances were present. Like with Crota and Oryx. At best I just believe that we are stronger than the average guardian at the age of 5. Headcanons are fun

This is literally the only time Phoenix Dive has any practical use whatsoever.
---
Prospector has the highest burn Dps and is amazing.
---
They recommend Wendigo or Love and Death because they have Izanagi with Catalyst and well.
---
If you don’t have that then Prospector is perfect. You can also look a Whisper of the Worm carry.

yeaaah steam names
---
That and how god damn slippery you would be in PvP, with that mobility doesn't matter for shoulder peaks anymore since you can just dash back into cover or across a lane.
---
Computer science
---
For Titans, use mid tree hammer, or crownsplitter!
---
His main is a Warlock, he had a buddy farm up his hunter. So TITAN MASTER RACE
---
Crownsplitter worksn
---
Amazing
---
Is it as good as people say is it worth it?
---
You might want to try and get the moon grenade launcher. It can roll spike nades AND full court.
---
Sauce?
---
Did you start yesterday?
---
Okay buddy
---
Why use lot word when few word do trick?
---
r/destinyusernames
---
Farm a love and death nade launcher from the moon with full court and spike grenades. Highest Dps without Wendigo light swaps.
---
Prospector and Whisper of the Worm are also great until you get an Izangi with catalyst. You can get Whisper carries easily.
---
Oeft, good luck!
---
Sure you'll smash it
---
Np :)
---
atmospheric glow like some others said, but it also has the itsy-bitsy spider ornament from s6
---
Yeah got the ornament. Will try it later
---
you'll have my upvote. Highly under rated "sniper"
---
Maybe , maybe...
---
But I did smash the recluse the day b4 yesterday 
---
Recluse &gt; University 
---
Gotte get dem 26 comp wins
---
Not really though. Arc staff is clearly meant to be used to clear ads.
---
Yah its just hard to please everyone and since everyones playstyles are different , i get the difference in opinions. There used to be days where once a game launches the devs had no way to fix it... it was what it was -you either enjoyed it and played or bought a new game.
---
ps4 sorry i forgot to mention
---
ps4 :(
---
Then that makes sense lol. Back when I played on console it was pretty frustrating to do the levers on anything but my hunter. But now that I’m on pc its pretty easy.
---
2100 glory? If so you need to reinstance for it to update, go to tower, destination, orbit, etc
---
If one weapon or armor piece is ruining your experience then that is mostly on you. I totally agree OEM is busted but that is one thing out of allllllll the weapons and armor pieces. Nothing is ever perfectly balanced but there is no need to complain over and over and over about every little thing when in reality it’s pretty damn balanced.
---
Vector Zero, a green/common ship that Amanda sells (sold?)
---
No... SUCK THEM
---
On PS4 a 100 mobility hunter with stompees literally moves faster up close than 10 sensitivity can keep up with. Generally I see these people using Arc battery, dust rocks blues, not forgotten. Get close, dodge, jump to the ceiling, rain down shotgun death.
---
Recluse is actually pretty weak in IB. I was getting greater success with Deathly Orchid and Outbreak.
---
Nah, for some reason his character did not load. Everything else was there but Shaxx. Had to reload the Tower and wait for a moment
---
as far as I can tell, what's going on is that the pool of gear that the engrams distribute is just tiny, and you're not getting lucky. At this point I don't even consider purple engram drops rewards anymore.
---
I’ve only cleared Garden like 3 or 4 times, but I have almost *only* got the arms for it.  My first run, I did end up getting the chest, cape, and fusion rifle too, but every subsequent run I have been blessed with numerous variations of the Hunter arms.  It kind of sucks.  Farming for the right roll is cool and all, but I’d love to complete the set first.
---
The other day I accidentally left my boss mods on from the raid when I went into iron banner and he did like 2 damage to me. It's canon
---
No no no you should use the superior site wherethefuckisxur.com
---
Glory is the point below the valor thing right and i need a lot of wins as well don’t i?
---
This is great, are we allowed to use it?
---
Yeah I’ve still got to keep practicing on it I probably could have got it by now it’s just the whole finger slips off of button making me have to do it all again
---
I have D1 taken king steelbook case
---
The vault of glass is a convergence of time lines; atheon's throne is that conflux. 
---
That means all timelines converged in the vault, so killing Atheon in the vault means Atheon is dead dead.
---
Sometimes I can play for hours without issues but when the error kicks in I can't stay connected for more than 3 minutes straight, it's unbearable.
---
Aka terrible
---
????
---
Glory is the rank under the survival playlists, and yeah you do need wins for the recluse triumph
---
I would love to see the vid, saving this :)
---
What shotgun were you using?
---
Is that really Savathun?
---
You can shoot above someone’s head and the game will give you the head shot 9/10 times
---
Word. Well back to the grindstone
---
Nice that's call
---
Other extra sources of speed to flip the levers fast enough:
---
MIDA Multitool &amp; Minitool combo  
---
For Hunters: bottom tree arcstrider &amp; Stomp-EE5 exotic
---
Other classes each have speed boosting exotic but I don't know their class abilities well enough.
---
The Sol Divisive is the sect of Vex who worship the Darkness in the Garden. Think of them like the weird, estranged uncle. The other Vex want nothing to do with them.
---
So is monte carlo like the lowest drop rate or something cause like half this subreddit seems to want and not have it
---
Every time you go past the bank to the next wave - drop them. You could get insta'd or invaded. Every little helps.
---
I want to know also
---
F
---
So cool
---
I've run it multiple times on each character with varying success. Not counting weapons, I got two gloves for my Hunter, two gloves for my Warlock, and four gloves for my Titan. My prayers go out to rngesus.
---
Hey man, I was in the same boat for the longest time. LFG on xbox is kinda crummy, but works sometimes. I reccomend the destiny app, way better. If you're on this evening around 7-8ish, look up TheRavensabre, I'm always down for a fireteam
---
Crucible is a mini game in a pve shooter.
---
Dunno where i said i want to get em easy... unnecessary baby rage
---
Celestial nighthawk meta? Only need one shot if literally tens of thousands of vex will chain solar explosions with each other.
---
Or something like Sunshot?
---
Would be a sight to see for sure.
---
Yeah. But however according to the books of sorrow [I know I know, grain of salt] the vex are a product of the darkness itself? Or did I misunderstand that passage where the krill talk about the vex born of darkness and nature?
---
They can't figure out the endgame because they cannot simulate light or darkness. Which is why there are no Taken in the infinite forest, and it took them hundreds of years to finally kill Saint-14.
---
For sure, but the problem would be surviving 15,000 torch hammers simultaniously raining on us to get that off lol
---
Snipers are still incredibly good, it's more about positioning than anything and having solid aim
---
The face made me laugh
---
The 1KV ornament is so yucky tho 
---
49 chests before I got one
---
There's a lore entry that states that all this time we've been fighting the Vex equivalent of landscapers and construction workers. We're just punk teenagers who kick mulch around and steal their traffic cones.
---
One of them agents is about to have a bad time against Neo.
---
Kind of weird to get weaker. I wish they’d cap the artifact to +20. It’s like playing wow and having to do your dailies everyday.
---
thanks man ill give it a try.
---
All Banshee had to do was write down the goddamn code and Leviathan's Breath would've been a much shorter quest.
---
It's completely normal and should not bother anyone.
---
Seriously. I thought they nerfed OEM. Still brutal.
---
Is this true there’s another bug 😂😂😂
---
i can understand resetting the + light from the artifact itself but if the season end would take me from 948 to freaking 750 i doubt i would play much at all going forward.
---
I thought the same thing, couldn’t recreate it thou
---
Ah, yeah that would come in handy!
---
Awww man why did you have to do me like that
---
Okey thinks
---
I saw this immediately after seeing the original source, perfect timing.
---
I’m not 100% sure but I believe powerful drops cap at 950, and it’s pinnacle rewards from there.
---
Cool, that really helps to know ppl don’t have to be crazy high to get it done.
---
is my izanagi burden quest bug again? The Mysterious box is at my warlock but the black armory lock (the one required me to kill watcher in leviathen belly) is at m hunter . what do i do?
---
For Crucible I use Hawthorne’s Field Forged Shotty &amp; LH. 
---
PvE I use Loaded Question &amp; Breakneck even though it’s nerf screwed it over.
---
Don’t know if either of those are good but LQ &amp; LH are pretty good weapons.
---
Iron Banner and Crucible in general made me quit destiny, after many hours I have finally come to realise that you cannot realistically play this game long term as a PVE exclusive player.
---
They drop at you’re base power once you hit 950
---
Vengeance is the motivator, not the motive.
---
You’re correct
---
They will drop on level from that point on which will still make them useful as pinnacles give +2  so they can be used to up lower pieces by least 1 point.
---
It’s all about team work and kinda knowing what to do cause I just finished it last night and we had no mics
---
People should.learn how to keep to themselves
---
I know Liam Neeson does the voice in this movie; but for some reason I was reading this in James Earl Jones' voice.
---
Lol. You know of anything right now that 1 shot kills medium range outside of a shotgun (sort of medium range). I’ll post more videos. Keep an eye out for them.
---
Also, please be sure any uploaded images/videos are direct capture per Rule 15.
---
I would get rid of anything that doesn’t have a decent roll for perks. I’d also keep at least one weapon of each type to use for different bounties. Considering you get shards and possibly enhancement cores it would be worth it
---
It is
---
Honestly, we should be able to pick out any piece of armour from the collection book now, just give them all a shitty fixed roll but we can pull them for drestiny purposes.
---
Ok boomer
---
I always run A if i spawn on C, i once got a tripple with it cuz they were just done capping it whwn i came
---
And this guy just fucking RKO'd all the crybabies off the top rope!!!! TK\_Ghost is going home with the championship belt!
---
It's decent, I guess. But not crazy good considering you are running two primaries and both kinda short range.
---
Reminds me of the mechanist
---
Have you ever watched the movie?
---
That is up to you but I would look at the rolls you have on them, some might be good. I personally delete any legendary I have that I cannot gain from my collections that I like to use.
---
I just finished the nightfall last night but the people that were playing with me were around 953 and 955
---
Okey this is random but do you have the dlc you have to pay?
---
I feel this in myy soul.
---
Let's start with the rolls in the gun. Since I know where I can farm it and I can farm it now. Armors - I barely know a thing but I'm using the exotic boots I think from Xur which loads the HC when stowed upon hitting precision shots and I've been kind of using it with the HC's that I have.
---
I enjoy crucible gamemodes like momentum control and mayhem, but loathe the normal valor gamemodes, and I especially hate comp. I've only played one match, and had two oem titans on my team, two on enemy team. We won, but it was a shit fest of playing chicken and camping heavy ammo.
---
Don't even get me started on the whole issue with the quests that require you to play PvP. Stuff like Thorn and Lumina I can understand, Chaperone and the pinnacle weapons too, but I really prefer to just not play PvP at all. Not until they decide to remove exotics from the gamemode. You still get your silly mountaintop and your binky-recluse but learn to play without Foetracer or OEM or Multi-tool and so on and so forth....
---
Really need some folks to que up with, but it seems like all the clans are interested in is sweats.
---
🙏
---
Garden of salvation raid before final boss fight
---
It doesn’t, I added my final key into the box and nothing happened the key was destroyed and now it’s stuck
---
Well, mountaintop, erentil (or any well rolled fusion), Jotun, revoker (if you wanna count it's very low zoom) just to name a few. 
---
Go ahead and post more, hopefully they'll be more impressive and really badass!
---
If you have raised your base light through pinnacles to 951, powerful drops (and the occasional non powerful) will now drop at 951
---
I was irritated with the insane use of the recluse...
---
...so I got one. Problem solved
---
You never used 1-2 punch
---
Get on me level punk
---
Guardians, knocking down his door in a future raid: TOO WEAK, TOO WEAK!
---
It may seem obvious to most, but I'll say it anyways.  The recoil is vertical and you need to hit with as many bolts from the burst for a reliable kill.  Aim at the shin/waist area, and adjust as needed for varying recoil distances
---
Thanks man and I got an Xbox on the 7th and started playing the next day and destiny is the only game I got at the moment so that’s probably the main reason
---
PvP will always be doable without the dlc but enjoyable I wouldn't know. PvE is wether or not your a lore nerd a raider or a pinnacle chaser. These decide if you need the dlcs. In my experience I'd say play the old story play a little competitive after the story play some Gambit and decide. If your on Xbox I have no issue helping you grab the ropes. As for level 30 350 power no. I believe you will be at 750 like the rest of us at the start
---
Oh, is there a buff for hunters?
---
Unfortunately competitivr is now just a bunch of scrubs running around with their jotun and mountain top. Anyone who uses grenade launchers as secondary or primary are scrubs that have no skill level.
---
I have one but I’m trying to join a different one my guys don’t play too much anymore
---
We are mary sues. People just let it slide because it's a power fantasy.
---
thx
---
Get gud
---
Reminds me of  socom navy seals 2 back on ps2. Hiding in high grass and popping out. I wish these type of tactics were more readily available in FPS games.
---
Patiently?! In Titan?!!!
---
Are Titans even allowed to stop running?!! Even when the barricade is up, I just run in circle.
---
I had forgotten about this legendary piece of lore
---
Xur shows Riskrunner as the exotic for me????? There is no Cerberus +1
---
APES! Bring a ragequit
---
Arc battery does nothing for spectral hunters, oppressive darkness might but arc battery is for arc subclasses only
---
Let me rephrase it: I would pay silver for it, if there was also a way to get it for free (that isn't stupidly difficult but isn't too easy).  Also, if it was only for silver then the community would explode.
---
You’re not going to be the best you can be by using better weapons.  That’s so backwards.  Gun familiarity is the last thing you want to get down.  Practicing with guns that aren’t the best in their category will benefit you hugely when you switch to something that performs objectively better.  That concept is pretty much consistent across every form of competition ever conceived.
---
I’m gonna run bergusia tonight (got my keymould last week). Wish me luck haha...
---
Haha I'm right there with you. Was a D1 player and recently got into D2 with the update. I only really play crucible and find it pretty enjoyable even though I don't have any of the meta gear and weapons. I just focus on my game even if it's clear some players have an advantage with their builds. I do want to make a better build for my warlock but feel lost whenever I come to this sub and I see all the weapon and gear names.
---
This is exactly why many players don’t even bother raiding. It’s so damn toxic ! You didn’t know how to do it at some point too like damn dude. Asking for a million clears when some just barely have less than 3 or 10 how the hell that let’s you know they are going to suck? I have played with players in the last wish raid with 50 plus clears and can’t even stay alive smh
---
\^ This dude has bragged about being "Unbroken" like 3-4 times in his last like 10 posts..  LOL.  No one cares nerd.
---
Shows Cerberus for me when I went to him and im on PC.
---
The maintenance was yesterday. You could turn them in yesterday after noon.
---
Who is this "they" exactly? Everything I've seen seemed like pretty obvious jokes that play up how Savathun has played us - not annoyance over a lack of something significant happening that almost everyone should have known wasn't going to be the case anyway.
---
Do you have the template?
---
My current favorite retort to it is eriannas vow and your preferred form of extended melee. One quick hip shot to the body and an extended punch drops them before their shoulder charge gets to you
---
Ikora says I don’t get any jam with my toast if I don’t sit still though....
---
this hurts me on a spiritual level
---
Any heroic adventure on any planet. It has to be a **heroic adventure,** non-heroic normal adventures and heroic story missions will not.
---
It's still not fun
---
Seems they swapped it out for riskrunner now.
---
Don't know why, showing for people with all dlcs as well.
---
Dang
---
I only have one character
---
Sorry for my noobness, what's Y1/Y2/Y3?
---
It took me a second to understand but yea don’t go in the portal cash the motes
---
Okei I got it, so I gotta keep on trying weapons I found till I get one for it?
---
Fuck the term "Dad Weapons."  It's PVP.  I'm going to use whatever I'm best with to get as many kills as I can.  If you have time to complain about "dad weapons," you have time to throw more grenades!!!!"
---
Worst part is...cerberus isn't a weapon you see him selling very often.
---
This is me with gambit. I f***ing hate gambit with a burning passion but need to get those powerful gear
---
It's been mostly on Twitter, which is where the more acidic demographic of the community tends to voice their complaints.
---
Yeah, it isn't much more than "get x kills with y weapon" a few times. You can probably knock the whole thing out in a day.
---
this is 100% me with the survival grind for the recluse
---
bro stop tryna find excuses for your cheesy ass. you have zero integrity, and you're going nowhere when or if the game's eventually balanced since you'll have no mre crutches to walk on.
---
i thought about making an elaborate response but thinking about it, you lost all my respect. limp boi.
---
I bless u with god rolls strangr c:
---
Exactly why I am pouting.
---
Risk runner is one of the simplest exotics to fetch.
---
Yes and if you recall from the movie the scene when they are on the boat being followed by the dread pirate Roberts, Vizzini says “he’s followed us? Inconceivable!” To which Inigo Montoya says “I don’t think that word means what you think it means” followed by an awkward silence. 
---
Also just for you. 
---
r/Whoosh
---
Nice new format!!
---
Well done
---
I can hear your internal screaming from here
---
Especially when we only needed his two for the primeval
---
Can you sent me the new format?
---
So awesome!
---
Yeah you better wait just incase!
---
I killed an entire team once with chaos reach. People say titans are the skatiest bois in d2 but since i switched to warlock i really think its warlocks
---
He was till bungie switched the weapons for some reason
---
Must have to watch it again I forgot that part
---
Yea, everyone. It updated shortly after he appeared. Just waiting on the new infograph and I'll replace it.
---
 Everything I read on Xur today said Cerberus.  
---
I logged into Destiny to buy it, I saw he in fact HAD cerberus but it would not let me buy it, I'd click it but nothing happened, so I went into orbit and back to Xur only to see Cerberus was swapped out with Riskrunner.
---
It’s ok it’s an old one
---
i got shadowkeep but also a riskrunner offer
---
Is the Cold Fusion medal not available in Iron Banner?  Or do I just die too much?
---
Get outa here with that titan heresy
---
Thanks!
---
Shaxx left hes si disappointed lol
---
It really do be like that.
---
Am i supposed to know him?
---
Meanwhile I, a hunter main, pulls out butter knives and dies almost immediately.
---
Dammit. it doesnt read well. the guardian has the text "The entire 960+ enemy team coming to my point"
---
Roaming supers were just a bad idea in Destiny. 3 shot golden gun was the only ok one. Also I miss D1's nova bomb mechanics.
---
Not possible, he dosent sell exotics for the current season.
---
Shadowkeep does not include Forsaken.
---
I need that redrix still
---
The bosses in Savathun's Song and A Garden World don't count for the "kill a boss of this type" bounties. They are likely supposed to, though. 
---
If you are trying to report a bug, just warning you, this is a purely fan subreddit so Bungie does not go here.

And all of a sudden in didn't feel so alone as a gamer parent.
---
Lol
---
No, I am yu
---
I have been completely ignoring the season content to finally get recluse/mountaintop, so I know the feeling.
---
I N D E E D
---
Seriously, they’re going to try and sell pikes that are burning? Hopefully they abide by the 3 day lemon law.
---
Hahahaha
---
Eater of worlds
---
I have forsaken and he was only selling risk runner. But guess what I GOT CERBERUS OUT OF MY FATED ENGRAM! Come on bungie for Christ sake
---
He’s probably running max strength and a few armor perks that reduce your melee cooldown.
---
or...you could play Gambit Prime which with the seasonal multiplier it will give you 2% for the quest to unlock the catalyst. Will help you towards that 21% delerium pinnacle machine gun quest too.
---
As for the kills just play normally and you'll rack them up quick.
---
 In the festering core strike, zavala says to eris morn how "we" (zavala included) killed orix. SMH
---
Probably the more productive thing to do. I was just flabbergasted.
---
Entitled person thinks that he should be able to use the elemental glow effects on different armor. 
---
Even though it was stated that they were only for the solstice gear. They even stated that if you got the legendary armor then you can get a 2.0 version of the armor.
---
Why would they refund something because you can't be bothered to read TWAB.
---
But from what it seems they attempted to patch back in the lost progress. This may be a loose case
---
Yeah I used 6shooter last time but this time it’s taking me an age only on 50% and Iya just taking forever
---
It nearly killed her, hahaha

Funny thing is: that was where my face palm emote was right before I switched it out. Meant to face palm and instead gave him a dumb wave.
---
Beautifully done
---
No one knows. This is probably a bug. Someone speculated it could be due to daylight savings, but really we have no idea.
---
I see thanks for the reply, would you recommend them both?
---
r/yourjokebutworse

I want that ghost shell 😔
---
Thanks. In conclusion this post is unreasonable.
---
I see thanks for the reply, would you recommend them both

If something appears in the Eververse store, it means the only way is to buy it (either for silver, which is real money, or bright dust, which is not). If it appears outside the Eververse store, it means you can get it with some other in game currency and not real money.
---
See, I actually like PvP. My issue is I'm either running into clan premades or I'm just constantly playing against people better than me. On one hand it makes me want to improve and get together some proper PvP gear, but on the other hand its really demoralizing to constantly fight better players. Also, that lag is ridiculous.
---
Ah ok, damn that sucks. Still at school so I was never able to get it
---
They are both solid picks. Which one you want to buy depends on you. Some people prefer one over the other.
---
Counter a recluse? Dont kid yourself
---
Thanks friend appreciate the advice
---
Yeah, I raid a decent amount, and iron banner. If you farm the tokens the armor he can drop is still potentially higher stats.
---
These memes are starting to get annoying. Almost as annoying as the fact that Epstein didn’t kill himself.
---
Ahh thanks! You really are a Very Helpful Guardian! :)
---
That is one good looking LGBTQ titan!
---
I would if you want the full experience!
---
It was only the keys. The RNG part, which is the longest/hardest to complete, was left untouched. With the response of "just get another rare bounty forehead". Does that seem like good business?
---
Do exos have surnames? They can reference him in lore as Bagel-4 K. if he really does end up breaking the curse.
---
YOU KNOW WHAT SHAXX-AY?
---
Insurmountable skull fort for striker, or you can spec into strength and use monte carlo
---
yeah sry i didnt mean to combine those, but now i want to ask you about your name
---
Haha. I just love how you were looking a safe spot to clip that play.
---
Pro tip...if/when you get the rare bounty its description is misleading.
---
The bounty requires you to complete 50 waves in forges. You don't need to fight the boss and you don't need to complete the forge for the first two waves to count. You can literally do the first 2 waves and when the boss spawns you can bail. Call it scummy but blame Bungie for not requiring you to finish the forge for the 2 waves to count.
---
Its amazing how many people were uninformed for so long. You would think there would be a big "Dont Do This Sign" on the weapon. Or lock the bounty like they did telesto
---
I might make a titan my second main ive only used warlocks untill now but those bullcraps titans get are to strong
---
I know your pain...
---
thanks for the write up! i just play momentum control and it goes pretty well i get around 10 kills a match. so i just make sure when momentm control is around i play it and should eventually be able to get ruskys knife. thanks
---
The headless horseman hath returned!
---
Lmao, damn autocorrect. Fun run.
---
Playing as a hunter is just a constant string of supering into walls I swear
---
more than kind of :P
---
I dont really understand whats so bad about Titans, I have a way easier time fighting titans than any other class.
---
Or the fucking Amazon ads. I swear I get the Amazon AR ad 95% of the time (and other Amazon ads 3% of the time).
---
I love the Show of Force XF4865, but is a pain to get a decent roll. Go for Tranquility if you wanna farm more consistently (i still didn't get a good roll for it...).
---
Top tree for add clear. Tether as many red bars as you can and hope a couple yellow get in there and you will have your super back pretty quick for the next wave of adds. 
---
Bottom tree for boss damage. First tether grabs and debuffs. Addition tether shot to boss will do extra damage. 
---
I personally run top tree just to always have my super ready. I have plenty of weapons for dps
---
Recovery makes a much larger difference than recovery or mobility. The ability regen stats are up to preference. 
---
There is only a meta in pvp, where people look for a lot of intellect.
---
Upvoted 'coz I was looking for him and more people needs to know where he is right now.
---
Just pretend you've never seen it
---
There are a wide variety of guns that fulfill the same role as recluse, but nothing quite the same. I would say try out primary (white) ammo guns until you find the ones you like.
---
Most Year 1 planetary vendors and raids will give you fixed rolls. Handing materials into Devrim, Sloan, Failsafe, Asher Mir or Brother Vance will obtain fixed weapons like Scathelock. Leviathan Raids released in year 1 (Leviathan, Eater of Worlds, Spire of Stars) will give out fixed roll raid weapons such as Midnight Coup.
---
Year 2 and beyond activities and destinations (strikes, crucible, tangled shore, dreaming city, black armory, gambit, gambit prime, menagerie, gunsmith, zavala, LORD SHAXX, anything moon related and raids like Last Wish, Scourge of the Past, Crown of Sorrows and Garden of Salvation) are going to drop random roll weapons that you can grind until you receive the rolls you want.
---
Oh thats poopoo, I just got lucky with mine then, I had the one where you needed a full set of gear kills and I just kept forging things on multiple characters for the black armory schematics to get the forge polymers to keep getting the armors and finished in a little over a week

Honestly I'm not too sure. My lock box was actually removed and I was automatically moved on to the next step in the quest. That left me with a new issue though where I have 2 black armory keys in my quest log with no option to dismantle/discard them, and no box to put them in. So now they're stuck there. This whole bloody thing is a shambles.
---
Recovery makes a larger diff than resilience or the other way around?
---
IB this week...Momentum Control next week after IB is gone!
---
I close my eyes and is still there, and the urge to get it is uncontrollable, which isnt helping in making wise choices with my money. 
---
Im going to have to lock my paypal account away.
---
Oh darn
---
It might eventually pop back into the store for bright dust seeing as they have both new and old stuff rotating through, so your only bet is hoping that it does, hoping it'll drop from free engrams, or buying more unfortunately.
---
Potatoes of the tower unite! 
---
Congrats, by the way. You’re almost there.
---
I wish I had a pc yalls guns got no recoil ☹️
---
I may need to start farming on alts too if I wanna get this done lol. If I wasn't working so much I probably wouldn't complain. But my spare time is limited so it's a bit annoying.
---
The last chunk of cheese in the fridge
---
Me half naked walking through the cold-ass house at 3 am looking for food
---
I've developed a gambling problem over this, and buying more is no longer an option. I will have to go cold turkey and just follow the rest of your advice, to wait. It will show up, eventually.
---
Whats funny is that I got literally everything else BUT the burnout
---
Maybe. Personally I turned it off once and it was while doing the 450 scout rifle kills for randy's. Like. Dont get me wrong, I love you shaxx, but hearing "you've lost a/b/c" a million times a day is not helping my sanity.
---
Power level this season doesn't matter quite as much as it used to but it can still make all the difference
---
Kinda sad this got downvoted
---
thank you
---
Hunter 
---
Outlaw. The solar one you probably already new that.
---
Or the fancy knife throwing one that's also solar the Forsaken exclusive one
---
Thanks for the answer &lt;3
---
It’ll come back for some promoting event, or possibly random drop from nostalgic engrams
---
Its definitely not hard to deal with if you know what you're doing
---
This is Reddit. And these are gamers. You're talking about the worst people in society, my dude.
---
There's not 4 subclasses its just the bottom one is the legs of the the person doing fists of havoc.
---
I play games on mute when watching sports alot. But then I do single player stuff. Not online play
---
Welp you can get to [the End of the Strike](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1908874044) thats at that location.
---
this is another reason why i personally think everyone should be automatically opted into team chat when playing TEAM gamemodes
---
gambit
---
gambit prime
---
freelance comp/all pvp
---
how the fuck can i callout if nobody is listening because chats are by default set to manually opt in and half of players dont know how to opt in, or change the setting, i play a ton of gambit and can call invaders as they spawn, but it doesnt help when nobody listens and i watch my teammates hording thier 15 motes and running to hide in spawn (which btw doesnt help, it turns it into a shooting gallery :) )
---
team chat is used for more than just being salty to your team, (:
---
Just did that today, worked fine for me. Did you restart the game?
---
tell me how to avoid the recluse. tell me the magic trick every top tier player has been missing that you’ve managed to figure out to avoid the most broken weapon in this sandbox.
---
It’s probably because he just enjoys the super, but there is a bug that causes Nova Warp to do ~6x the damage it’s supposed to.
---
Okay, but that range is MUCH different than 3.0+ range.  1.1-1.5 means you're playing about even with competition and, yes, you should remember to work objective and play smarter.  If you are in a match and getting 3.0+ then you do actually serve your time better and help your team more simply by continuing to kill as many opponents as possible and trust teammates doing less work to cap zones.
---
Oh TIL
---
You sound like the guy I kept shoulder charging last night. He was a little bitch too.
---
They legit broke this exotic.  You can still use Phoenix protocol and be fine but the skull.... it’s just GONE. Let the warlock people have their chance to play with different exotics and subs other than WOR and lunafaction boots. 
---
I am actually quite surprise they didn’t nerf nazarec’s as well. It’s pretty good right now with recluse and the artifact mods. 
---
Let’s see how long this goes.
---
im about to do that, I hope that fixes the issue
---
Xur has changed his mind
---
Yep ^
---
This would be a losing prop for Bungie. 80% of the players wouldn't bother with it, and 10% of the players would be getting an amazing deal because they'd normally spend way more than $25 on EV during the season. That leaves 10% of players that would actually pay more than they'd otherwise have spent at EV and that's not going to make the cut.
---
Just giving myself 1337 karma with this comment. Nothing to see here.
---
Recluse is only good at medium to long range. Either A, keep your distance or B) use a shotgun to rush out. Additionally, the only way a recluse really gets good, is when flanking. If you can avoid being flanked or anticipate it well enough, you can win in a fight. I'm telling you it's not a over the top weapon.
---
They game will always put anything else in the scoreboard instead of most melee kills ;-;
---
Oh believe me we tried
---
How can you hate the exos they are the coolest race in destiny
---
That's a very good point because I heard its useful for shotgun slides but I'm not a shotgun slider in pvp. But that reload and speed would definitely come in handy during nightfalls
---
Something did happen: Savathun broke the fourth wall to laugh at us for falling for her obvious trap.
---
That’s where you go for the Strike in shadow keep

&gt; The series focuses on [Charlie](https://hazbinhotel.fandom.com/wiki/Charlie), the princess of Hell, and her quest to open a hotel for rehabilitating demons. Hell suffers from overpopulation and Heaven solves the problem by routinely exterminating demons yearly. Charlie, who has grown up in Hell, wants to find an alternate solution to the mass slaughter. She opens the [Happy Hotel](https://hazbinhotel.fandom.com/wiki/Happy_Hotel) which aims at teaching demons and sinners to become better people. There is substantial resistance though, and Charlie and her friends must work together to keep the hotel running.

This sounds *amazing.* Is it streaming anywhere?
---
Nope, none are bugged. Finished all of mine the other day - - nothing misbehaved.
---
To joke in such situations is gloating. When the time can be better spent it is complacency or arrogance. It's fine. Some people are comfortable displaying that behavior. I'm not.
---
Oh yeah when I’m the last alive in a nightfall I slide around with them a lot it has saved my ass so much
---
Im assuming this is on pc
---
"Ha, you're crushing them! Send them home crying."
---
I read to do 10 in a week and you'll get one
---
Oh lawd
---
Ahh makes sense. Yeah now the gun has a dedicated quest, and at the end of the quest when you pick up the gun you get to go into this room and test it out on a huge group of Fallen when you clear them all the catalyst drops.
---
Pay more attention to this shit, i hope this was a joke. He absolutely did not kill himself, and it's serious.

N o
