The engram from Saladin? It says I need to complete the Scour the Rust quest to access it.

---
---
isnt 950 hard cap and 900 soft cap. 950 + is just pinnacle gear from now own
---
Those aren‚Äôt ornaments those are his xrays after the Clinton‚Äôs pay him a visit
---
If guardians standing around in tower using emotes is canon, and us players controlling the player character guardians is canon, then I'm pretty sure going to orbit is canon too. 
---

---
And while there's no direct indication, doesnt the fact that this is the only time we both see  completely invulnerable shriekers and void crystals kind of indicate that. Also if that's not what the voide crystals were for, what were they doing with them?
---
*Rare*
---
There is one exotic with each one, but yea, i agree we should be able to put them on any of them
---
Ima have to say nah
---
Swarm would be useful if it did 25% more damage. You can literally sprint out of the grenade and dodge 100% of the damage, the projectiles move too slow to catch a moving target and detonate without being in range of the enemy.
---
So that makes 2/3 trash. The Tripmine is also average as it puts a gigantic red flashing beam where it is so you just don‚Äôt walk over it..
---
Its so sad how cool these are and most of them are hardly used if not at all!
---
I really liked that mission.Yes, it‚Äôs tough, takes a competent team, good load-out and practice on the jumps, but very doable. The catalyst jumping part for it is way tougher than the gun, but still pretty easy with practice.
---
Thanks ! I‚Äôm new to this sub so I appreciate the help and pointing me in the right direction for my question
---
DPS over time, sure. Single use, not at all,
---
They drop from forges and turning in bounties.
---
‚ÄúBeing is a team is good. I‚Äôm not gonna do that. This is Bungie‚Äôs fault.‚Äù
---
Yeah, one of us is not the smartest one. For sure.
---
Prime engrams are super useful. Especially once you're past 950. As you level up and get pinnacle gear, prime engrams will help you level up slacking slots and also provide you with gear at your new gear level above 950, so you can even use them to transmit weapons you use very often to higher power levels.
---
Did I noticed this in my feed the other day. I was wondering how I subbed to this random guy lol.
---
well i can't, maybe im just bad it has just been a week playing, if some of u can help me i would apreciate it
---
I swear if i hear ‚ÄúThe exo are among the greatest mysteries. They‚Äôre well encrypted, even to themselves‚Äù from the cryptarch one more time...
---
Idk what she is but boy is this specimen T H I C C
---
Edit: fixed a typo
---
Maybe... I dunno just a thought, but the forsaken storyline?
---
That's the tradeoff, your single use grenades are your trip mine, solar scatter thing (cant remember the name), and I think you guys have an incendiary no?
---
I think the biggest hangup concerning the eververse store is this. It isn't there for you to get free stuff anymore. You need to stop thinking of the store having anything to do with brightdust. Bungieniw giving people the chance to earn maybe 1-2 high end cosmetics with brightdust a season. That's it. Brightdust no longer has any place going forward in any meaningful sense. I agree a schedule of what's coming would be nice to know what to spend your silver on. But that's it. Older players are used to the large ount or brightndust and engrams dropping. That's not the direction bungie is going. With destiny going free to play they are transforming the store into 99% silver based, with a small touch of bright dust available each season to spend. I'm perfectly fine with that. If that's how bungie needs to make money I'm all for it. 
---
I do agree a schedule of what's going up for sale would be nice though.
---
K so what I‚Äôm getting from this is that power level only matters in raids but not pvp, right?
---
No those do not count ahead sadly
---
Looks great! Congrats!
---
If you only run gunslinger you are going to have a bad time with grenades. There are other subclasses that have way better grenades. Swarm grenade is good if you smack an enemy in the face with it.
---
[deleted]
---
Oh well, go get 2 more motes then.
---
The Architects are the final boss of the Destiny Series, you cannot beat them
---
Just gotta wait the suspension out
---
I'm such a dumbass , Thanks ( I fixed it )
---
I still use the ‚Äúthanks‚Äù emote for those who actually do heroic events
---
Damn dude you're special as fuck! The game literally changes the rules for you. Sorry, I'll just get on my knees and bow. You're a true iron lord. Fucking idiot.
---
Did pulse grenades get nerfed at some point? I remember doing leviathan dogs, and if you could get a high enough stack, a titan could easily take out two dogs with nothing but 2 grenades
---
Jade rabbit all the way!
---
You can wear them they will just be 0 light level. But for most things this won't hurt you to much.
---
Tbh idk, I mainly play warlock and I hardly ever run arc subclass
---
I thought I was the only
---
long F my friend
---
I just don‚Äôt see no fun in getting kills that require no type of skill I just played a full team with erentil‚Äòs on comp pure douchebaggery it‚Äôs fucking insane the range on that shit it‚Äôs pretty much a sniper. It completely blows my mind how many people protect the fusion rifles
---
Get the coconuts! We need horses!
---
Isn‚Äôt it funny that before Thursday‚Äôs update, literally NOBODY in the community knew that mechanic existed. Lol. #PinnaclePowerIsBadAndItShouldFeelBad
---
Funny I‚Äôm on that one right now
---
The only one that does is the reset valor 5 times
---
It‚Äôs good close range and long it‚Äôs hard to counter when there is no cover
---
No I am not
---
Doesn‚Äôt your controller have it built in when you ads?
---
Tip I could give it Make sure you are 68k+ after the ogre, any lower i doubt you could hit 100k. When fighting nokris, make sure you actually do all the stages (celestial golden gun can completely skip the last immune phase) and be sure to kill all the adds on the last part, instead of just killing the knights to knock down nokris shield and finish him off. If it was me, i would wait until almost the 15 minute mark to kill nokris
---
I try to jumpshot to counter but that doesn‚Äôt work how are you supposed to counter that and it‚Äôs good for medium range too I‚Äôve been mapped multiple times at full health with the erentil
---
Try the last word quest.
---
U have inspired me to try primary shotguns...üêéüí®üë∞

People pay upwards of *thousands* of dollars for a fucking ***KNIFE*** on CS;GO, Idiocy's Pockets are much deeper than 700
---
If y'all want proof, In April of 2014, an M9 Bayonet Crimson Web was sold for $23,850.
---
Does everyone here have a mic?
---
May have been me. I'm hitting legend without using a gun this season.
---
1% quickplay, 2% survival, and 3% Iron banner
---
Mines broke currently, I can hear though
---
What‚Äôs your steam? Faster through steam
---
2 things. Different activities have level caps to them. That means that once you‚Äôve reached that cap, any level above it provides no advantage. For example, All raids except garden of salvation are all capped at 750. So anyone can do those at any time. 
---
The other thing is that the power level has slowly increased over time. If your watching older videos then they could have been recorded where the level cap was much lower than it is now. Hope this helped!
---
No, pinnacle rewards are extra powerful powerfuls that drop from things like the Iron Banner bounties.
---
Erentil is basically a sniper change my mind
---
They hated him because he told them the truth.
---
I'm a new light player so i wonder what are those
---
I have 1
---
Have you not seen top tree arc strider with liars handshake and arc battery literally punching everything?
---
Happens to things you‚Äôve had for a long time.
---
It‚Äôs just trash, nothing special.
---
This happened to my buddy last night in the same encounter
---
You have 3 slots, ideally 1 for each class or 3 of the same class for pinnacle gear farming.
---
To be fair it's not that hard to get.
---
Solo que and accept that you're going to suck for the first few matches. 
---
I grinded it in a day and used a decent hand cannon and riskrunner on varied flavours of voidwalker.
---
Is a fun gun though. If you chain with master of arms it's really quite annoying.
---
&gt; Electrostatic Surge
---
Arc logic if you have shadowkeep. I mean what do you want it for?
---
You have way more self control than I do. As soon as I get event/EV engrams I cash them in right away so see what drops.
---
hit me up on pc i will gladly help. :) dm me tho
---
Indeed
---
You know Erentil is primarily a counter to Skullfort top tree striker, not OEM builds right?
---
Why do you have to be this way?
---
aww I was hoping they would do more bc it doesn't matter if they decrease it warclif still gets 20 rockets lol
---
If you have it, I did it with sweet business
---
Eververse Engrams from past seasons and events.
---
The colony will be your best friend then, I was using full grenade launcher loadout, but the colony helped me the most, and made it the least painful climb
---
I got 100 recov with 100 str and on warlock both that and with strength
---
The two 100‚Äôs are worth, keep chasing it
---
Let the kids think that max total stat matters, keep focusing on your min max m8
---
im in this picture and i dont like it
---
Are you coming?
---
I could be wrong but I‚Äôve found abandoned (random)quests acquirable again from master rahool
---
wdym I‚Äôm driving home rn be home in like 10
---
No Huckleberry catalyst for me then
---
The multi-kills are a breeze with it
---
I just wanna get rid of the quest since I'm sick of seeing it in my inventory
---
Erentil has gone too far to be a counter. It‚Äôs basically a clutch with all of the special ammo around the map. As long as you have a fusion rifle scavenger on, you can use it as your primary.
---
curious to see gameplay with this set up.
---
I love the doughnut vex so much!  I hope we see them more in the future.
---
Oh right, this totally explains why the 9 Guardian fireteam getting wiped out makes more narrative sense.
---
Pretty much old season engrams, every season they're different with different rewards!
---
The quest doesn't disappear, just the Undying title wont be available after the season ends and you need the three ritual weapons for the title. After the season ends you can still acquire the exit strategy, randy's and edgewise. It took me three seasons to get The Recluse as I'm terrible at pvp.
---
Whatcha wanna see?
---
Probably because sniper/shotguns used to be in the heavy slot and you can't have an empty slot so when the switch happened, you got a placeholder.
---
Yea same
---
Find out what armor drops from where
---
It also really helps if you have a shell perk that increases glimmer gain (I forgot the name, but I know the rust punk shell gives something like that). Ever since i got that, I don't think I have ever gone less than 200k in the last few weeks.
---
I didnt think they gave glimmer, but I'm not sure if bungo fixed it yet
---
Here‚Äôs one I found 
---
https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-03-20-destiny-2-thorn-quest-6007
---
The bad juju quest is related to the tribute hall
---
any recommendation for top slot kinetic weapon for trash mob killing ?
---
I have one with Overflow and Rampage that is my go to auto for pve.  Picking up heavy/special ammo and watching the clip auto reload to 80+ bullets always feels good.
---
And wardcliff coil
---
It‚Äôs sick that certain people feel FOMO to an extent that would make them somehow justify a purchase like that.
---
^^YUNG ^^TIDDY
---
Nice.
---
Dammm them from the "thic collective"
---
I think a few weeks ago someone else found a power 0 Butler just like you got.  He took it to the Moon and shot dregs with it and they would fly up into the air and fall down unharmed.
---
Holy shit someone help these people. That‚Äôs disgusting.
---
\*exotic recluse with ability to switch elements\* stioll want this?
---
Still do lol
---
Anything from crown of sorrow works
---
Yeah they prey on those with horrible RNG.  Selling services that state that if you pay this absurdly high price, you‚Äôll get Anarchy or whatever.  When they could get the raid exotic to drop in the first run and you‚Äôve just paid hundreds of dollars for a single raid clear. Ouch.
---
Quite breakable
---
Those cyclops where fucking you guys up
---
A sniper is a erentil change my mind
---
?
---
Miay rare stuff like mythos hack, shadow specter, and war mantis
---
What quality is it in. Nice pic btw
---
Hes from forsaken, in the reef.
---
The entire game has revamped
---
Let it go dude. It's dead.

Is this that mars crucible map?

I love vanguard but I also hate it

Yeah it came out last season

Also, if you are looking for armor, the wormgod caress, Looks dope. Gauntlets that randomly dropped for my titan.
---
I sent you a friend request, my tag is Blue#8665
---
Ayyy! I‚Äôm on pc as well and I could probably help out if you‚Äôd like. I‚Äôve done thorn before, I know the drill, but the last part is very difficult to solo
---
My first try it took 2 hours. 3 guys were a little under leveled though
---
True, true.
---
Grow thicc with strength
---
Shoot the last 3 guys in the right order. It‚Äôll be the same order in which they spawn.
---
You feel those 5 years when they say that...
---
&gt;Kindled Orchard is the way to go.
---
I don't see how you pc players do it. That looks so uncomfortable to me. I'm disabled with a bad back though.
---
Im using retold tale
---
Got it today from a nostalgic engram
---
Not the big three but UA high still loves them
---
If you're a child apparently.
---
100 meters
---
this is me every exotic quest.
---
Thanks Obama
---
I had no friggin idea you could ‚Äúkill‚Äù a tether orb
---
would love to kbow where you got each setting i love using rainmeter and that is a sick setup
---
ofc you can , just farm some knights at the beginning ,throw around 5 orbs into the pit , so more knights would spawn , and that¬¥s it
---
Who the hell says thanks mr in a video game?
---
Complete... for now
---
Is back peddling a good thing? Always thought that was a throw-in-the-towel move. Nevertheless, mama ain‚Äôt raise no bitch, flick my taint.

Same here, and this is why I held on to it.  It‚Äôs a piece of history now.

It's actually pretty easy to get 100k on the 920 one. On the boss it has three phases. On the third phase when her shield drops people just want to melt the boss. One the third wave you should be around 95k to 98k. Just have to kill a few more ads.
---
Be glad to help, DM me if you need a hand
---
No it‚Äôs the dreaded venture sniper. You get the shell after 3 resets so it‚Äôs guaranteed
---
Yeah I'm working on my second reset rn I'm also a new light player
---
How do you get multipliers ?
---
Why would you say something so controversial yet so brave?
---
Bravo 6 going dark
---
I'm so new that I don't understand this meme. Can someone explain what I'm most likely doing wrong here?
---
I think I remember the part of the bible where after 3 days god told jesus to "Get back in there, Guardian!"
---
What do you mean? It's a consistent 1.44x multiplier. Just make sure to clear everything before moving on. You should have plenty of time before the 15 minute mark where your score starts to go down.
---
Prestige leviathan
---
Exotic drops are infinite, you get a better chance with harder difficulties, tied directly to how many champions you defeat
---
‚ÄòThere‚Äôs no data like encrypted data I always say.‚Äô
---
Leviathan or leviathan??
---
also you can rico rounds off the skybox which is pretty funny
---
plz plz plz do one for every race.
---
You have to physically look up the person and invite them to your fire team. 
---
The in game joining thing doesn't work and never has to my knowledge.
---
Bruh this is the most "1st world problem" post ive seen on here lol
---
Someone has too, the grinds for weapons and drops really aren‚Äôt that bad if you just take the time
---
Your quite the getaway artist.
---
Do i need to finish enhance and the others or just jump right into the red war?
---
What platform
---
Well fuck i guess. it is hard to track someone down
---
Sometimes I wonder why I even use Reddit
---
Lmao yep
---
 Get back in there Guardian!
---
So your telling me that I can do the nightfall and get a chance to get an exotic multiple times ?
---
It's actually not that bad to solo if you have to.
---
Whats your frame rate and what res?
---
Use this discord server: discord.gg/d2pclfg
---
This is me now!
---
I have a masterworked version for crucible
---
I see nothing wrong
---
fucking despised the draw final mission. because to me it wasn't apparent that you had to shoot the gun. usually with those wild west gunslinger standoffs you're shooting the other person, so I figured the gun glowing was when you're meant to shoot him.
---
even after I looked it up shooting the guns was just total bullshit
---
I haven't done is bounties for long and I feel bad that he might be sad over it , why the fck do I feel that.
---
do you own forsaken? you need that to acquire Thorn &amp; Lumina
---
Yeah but 180s suck
---
Love the idea but what is with the cluster of icons on your desktop? But nice props
---
Arc strider has a melee that triggers health regen on kill and it resets if you dodge near an enemy. Infinite health regen resets if you can get melee kills.
---
thanks boomer
---
I love gravity falls
---
There's another one in the room for xenophage. And another one in the boss fight. So yes, this random hive text is a part of xenophage
---
Its called a troll
---
Broken link
---
We just spent about two hours on it. Had to call it. Was fun though! 
---
Go Team Vomit! Team Gambit sucks!
---
New light-er here, is there any indication from the game to know what triggers heroic PE? I've been playing a bit over a month now and sometimes it triggers, other times it doesn't, kinda confused here.
---
I just wanna say, the amount of money you guys hurl into the void on your PC for next to nothing-- just visuals and an illusion that you have a better product-- is completely insane.
---
I do bounties for each planet so that whe n I'm glimmer deficient I just buy some with materiel
---
It‚Äôs not crimes per se, but it‚Äôs fairly accurate for certain crimes. Take bank robbery for example. Bank robberies are all videotaped and 100% of them get reported. There‚Äôs no conspiracy to delete tapes of white bank robbers and cover them up. Also, the 13% thing isn‚Äôt accurate at all, because it‚Äôs actually a much smaller group within that subset soon the crimes, mainly male, and excluding children and elderly.
---
Fuck that prick, gets so annoying if I‚Äôm by the vault. 
---
I go to the far end by Shaxx, him and the robot are funny as hell. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt the crucible, not every place can be perfect‚Äù
---
A car.
---
 
---
I saw whip and thought this was a different sub lol
---
thats usually the joke of the meme, is that it isnt disgusting
---
It‚Äôs always different when playing with friends, after all even though you‚Äôre playing destiny to have fun, playing with a fire team of friends where you can mess about a bit makes it even more the fun. Just a shame that you get some idiots like the one you were dealing with who want to try and spoil it for you and your team.
---
Survival is the only Game Mode that gives Glory, all others only give Valor Ranks, if you are Valor rank legend, ‚ÄûValor Rank Up‚Äú popped up on your screen at least like 15 times while ‚ÄûGlory Rank Up‚Äú never did :)
---
I didn‚Äôt think I could get this many feels from a single comments section
---
How do you get that armour ornament?
---
The traveller seduces is with the power of the light, the Obamamid seduces us with obama care. 
---
Cause when the rest of the pyramids come knocking, we‚Äôre gonna need it.
---
And here we see yet again why neither top or bottom tree void are viable choices outside of pve.
---
It's pretty telling none of you died while standing in the super. Considering hunters hang in the air for almost 3 seconds and get no overshield, the best you hope for is canceling another super. Getting kills with a tether is just a bonus.
---
Even bottom tree... You have less control, less AoE, less damage, and less projectile seeking than a Dawn blade.
---
I‚Äôve had problems all weekend with game play. Really odd things like the a when popping my super the one I have equipped isn‚Äôt what happens. Had the ground pounder on and the missile arc super goes off.
---
G. G scrub just joking best ways to level up up are the ikoras vex parts ( +5 powerfull engram) this can combine 3 powerfulls in one ikora bounties for artifact leveling eris moon bounties and gunsmith bounties also vex invasions for the end hydra boss drops  a powerfull reward (max 2 per character) also using the season artifact armour or weapon rewards to bring up a lagging slot  to current power level (season rewards drop at level)  eris mon crafting table drops 1 bellow level or at level after you have 3 or so items at hight level try some public events to bring up lagging items oh and combine
---
Congratulations üéä
---
how do we even know that there is a 15th?
---
We live in the tower (we live in the tower)
---
LFG is the same as matchmaking except with extra steps. They could skip these steps simply by making one person create a raid lobby and 5 people join, the game automatically adding them in. Raid leader can kick as they please in the lobby, and boom, the LFG is now done in-game instead of having to use 3rd party services simply to access one of the best parts of the game.
---
For his effort of trying to upset us he actually gave us all a good laugh. It always seems to be crucible where you encounter people trying to get to you, although I got t-bagged by a gambit invader they other day which made me laugh, there team still lost the match it always seems to be trash players who do the stupidest shit. Lol
---
i have gotten every helmet exotic for every class (i play 3 characters)  
---
ive gotten 2 random exotic weapons and 3 random non helmet exotics  
---
i actually want to die
---
Just a pistol that fits into the primary weapon slot.
---
That might be true, but it doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with who‚Äôs committing the crimes in the first place, does it?
---
If you still need, I can help out in 10 min.
---
Oh man I'm one of those. I'm so sorry.
---
should have opened it on a different class character smh
---
I‚Äôve only ever really experienced it in crucible too, must purely be a pvp thing, have once or twice seen it in gambit when the invader has gotten an army of one, so I view that as a little triumph that deserves an emote
---
How did you get that blue "warlock" thing after your name¬ø¬ø¬ø
---
oh thank god I have been waiting for 2 maybe 2 and a half hours now
---
Almost every objective that calls for public events is satisfied quicker with heroic public events.
---
reporting does absolutely nothing
---
Yoo! Us Hunters are no better. We're Treasure *Hunters* after all.
---
It does if your reporting for bad connection
---
Thread closed, glad you found a team but in future please use either our LFG Megathread or r/fireteams or r/DestinyLFG
---
Post removed, not Destiny related content.
---
Same
---
Depends on your skill level. I'd consider myself a decent/average player, and I find it pretty damn hard to solo
---
The toaster is way worse than Recluse in my opinion. At least with the recluse it requires the user to aim
---
HEY!!! bungie needs that moneys for the coooontent
---
I'm sorry but we don't allow loot posts, so I have removed this. 
---
We are currently working on a solution to this however!
---
Wouldnt be much of a humble character if he pointed out how awesome and sefless he is.
---
Why two screens? Genuine question, I have no idea why people do it.
---
Also looks uncomfortable to my liking. Is position of keyboard **not centered** to the game screen feels alright? And lack of space to the right; feels like you are cornered and have no space to move when you want to. Where do you put your mic? Before the keyboard does not seem enough space. It stays to the right as it is so good it catches your speech or you have to constanly twist your body?
---
Overall, collector-thingies like guns and helmets look cool, but the place looks uncomfortable as hell. But maybe it's just mee. I have almost one meter of free space from each side of my chair and \~half of the table as free space as well.
---
P.S. I like Master Chief's helmet. A nice touch.
---
F
---
this moon
---
Oxygen SR3. It's a pinnacle weapon you can get by talking to Zavala and accepting its quest.
---
Cheese forever put out a guide earlier. Its possible to get the 100k in the 750.
---
thank you very much that means a lot to me.
---
What‚Äôs the difference between a ‚Äúviable‚Äù claim and a proven claim?
---
More Joker stuff. Wonderful...
---
You can do it easily. Speed through the first encounters like you would normally do killing all the adds. When you get to the boss throw the orbs off the map instead of doing boss damage. Each knight is 1000 points. We went over and started losing points but were able to get enough to do it easily. FYI boss worth around 3K when you trying to decide wherever to kill or not.
---
Good luck guardian.
---
FYI I did this on two characters today no problem.
---
Download the destiny 2 companion app on your phone
---
Sunshot?
---
Got picked off one by one.
---
How do u make it heroic. I thought it was like maybe a 50/50 chance. Sorry if I'm mistaken I would like to learn.
---
Can every pub event be made heroic?
---
yeah but theres nothing for PC
---
If works for pc
---
Ah ty
---
And what shader?
---
whoa didn't notice that update
---
Mom I swear it‚Äôs the true me not a phase!
---
Thank you, I've been playing destiny 2 for a good week now and I am really liking it, also the lore has really caught me.
---
But the keys are fixed? I did mine today.
---
Sorry I got confused between the symbols
---
The only way is doing her other main bounties and it will drop one per character in weekly
---
There are better guides that don‚Äôt take 48 minutes to cover 5 minutes worth of content
---
this meme would work in a dark souls subreddit but not here..
---
Are you looting the container at the end? That‚Äôs where you get the key.
---
He knew the risks
---
I know the struggle, the risk runner and liars handshake were my best friends through it lol, thankfully this ones possible solo, I‚Äôm on ps4 though if you end up needing an extra gun to help with anything.
---
Perfect thank you !
---
Thank and you aswell :)
---
Did they fix them? Been a few days since I've played, but they said they were fixing the black armory key and it broke even more
---
That was what pulled me in at first too. If you want a really good YouTube channel for anything lore related check out MyNameIsByf, he's basically the lore daddy.
---
Thank you i wish google said this lol
---
Looks great but maybe try to polish it a little bit
---
Duh. You see captains use them that way, and there‚Äôs really no reason to hold down the trigger AFTER shooting an already pretty strong shot, especially when there‚Äôs more things around you to shoot. Not very obvious, but I suppose this was not the right community to post this in given all the hate :/
---
I want to help but likely cannot, i can no longer go online as often.
---
It‚Äôs not erentil though. It‚Äôs Proelium FR3, which is nowhere near as snipey as Erentil. 
---
Also Erentil can be easily farmed in Menagerie.
---
Ohh yeah I know that, I already watched almost all of his 3 hours lore recap.
---
Ah so you're a man of culture.
---
Oh you‚Äôre right, my bad. They‚Äôre both Omolon so I get them confused.
---
Cause she's from a place in the universe?
---
Meanwhile, they would work on the technology to glare at you once they did.
---
Can you change your carather appearence later in the game?
---
The same reason you do?
---
Its a bug, just use smg that works
---
I'd love to help anyone out with pve content, add me on steam: *73772661*
---
In pvp, not much difference. Most top tier builds are available to new light players. I would suggest you look up Drewsky channel for hunter pvp specific stuff. I mean, even some blues are good like the Aachen sniper. Even handgun like the one you get from turning crucible token, the Better Devil can roll with some of the best perk. I would suggest you unlock your chalice for the menagerie as soon as possible. You have Beloved, Aunstringer, Dust rock Blues, Waking vigil, Erentil, anyway, a lot of top tier pvp gun can drop plus it's easily farmable.
---
Pve, having the best gun is not realy a requirement unless you're into nightfall or speedrunning. Some groups will be toxic but most don't care what you're using as long as it's appropriate, like don't come to a range fight with shotguns. Just take it slow, there's so much content out, it's easy to get overwhelm even as an older player.
---
Well I'd say, welcome back guardian!  
---
If you're playing new light, best i can think of is doing the campaigns or going around and doing bounties. U can also join a clan and do some stuff with them if u want. they kind of just put u down and expect you to find your way in this game anyways so its ur call. Farm up loot to 900 then grind even more till 950 (aka. end game content)
---
Yep, did it yesterday.
---
Grab up some bounties in the tower then go talk to Amanda in the hangar and play through the campaigns.
---
Oh my days, my controller would end up through my tv if that happened to me.
---
Lol wut?
---
Thanks üëç
---
Ye
---
Happy to hear that, thank you.
---
Go to spider :)
---
Considering that during the time with the cyclopses your focus should be mostly on the harpy/mind and its vomit getting hit by the cyclops happens more then you'd think
---
(have you even done the challenge?)
---
Hey you might hurt his feelings, Apologize
---
You ever drink baileys from a shoe? Creamy, milky, Bailey.
---
Dont forget rank 100 for the season ;)
---
considering that all the skilltrees are automagically unlocked, just use it all  D:
---
Didn‚Äôt imply that at all. Lol
---
An advice i can give is to be chill. IB is a sweatfest. If you aint gaining much progress take a break. Ppl tend to play worse when pissed off.
---
"Ooooooooooooo "
---
That knight thinks he‚Äôs playing comp or something. 
---
‚ÄúOh shit I better jump off before she gets me‚Äù
---
Thank you for your answer!, how should I keep upgrading it now on? Every 10 light levels?
---
I guess so
---
Then better take it up with Bungie forums and not a subreddit that Bungie doesn‚Äôt look at üëçüèª
---
Just solo it, it's easy
---
Just use the discord, don't listen to those console users about companion apps, the discord is way more popular
---
I sure hope you've got a fire team buddy because if you can't even figure out how to start the dungeon, there's no way you can solo it.
---
*Cries in no one shot abilities*
---
A knife to the head should be a one shot reeee
---
No that's old information. They stopped that with shadowkeep. I believe it's just from specific bounties now, but I'll not sure which.
---
The ordeal is harder than that strike lol
---
Only noobs think that jotunn is OP
---
Yeee
---
Weekly bounties from zavala, shaxx and the drifter give 200 each
---
The other extra bounties they favour give 10 each
---
And a well deserved Edge Transit for your troubles.
---
Congrats!
---
oh ok, thanks
---
Im gonna hurt you....i like you what do ya think of meh?
---
You get the box from Ada...
---
Wrong.
---
Actually, that's funny because I read on forums that Bungie don't look into forums most of times, but most likely to notice subreddit.  
---
Actual ticket form to fill is very missing, that's bad.   
---
But regarding that matter, I took both routes, here and there
---
that‚Äôs how my hunter looks like
---
\*single clap\*
---
Well, I got the leggings.. none of my ornament sets match with it and I doubt I can farm the full set with same/better stats, I have 64 helm and 62 hands.
---
You dont need SK to do public events on the moon. That's where I've seen it the most. Over by Hellmouth.
---
It's not spelled wrong I've just elevated my game so much I've mastered it
---
Just got done grinding solo comp for the recluse. I was dreading it going in. It actually ended up being my favorite crucible mode for exactly the reason you said. So many heart pounding moments at the end of matches. 
---
I honestly don‚Äôt like pvp much in this game but getting recluse was actually fun for me. 
---
However you do have to hope you get teammates that somewhat know what they are doing. And it helped me big time to get the wins via iron banner and just worry about the rank in comp.
---
So I fired again and I missed
---
And I missed again
---
So I fired and fired again
---
I missed both times
---
Mind if I use this In a meme?
---
Well, I learned that the hard way. I wouldnt have a problem with it but I lost a shard + 4 prisms + enhancement cores and I am not able to farm 980 like the hardcore players can for those mats.. so it was a rather big hit for my economy.
---
I just took your advice and got my Thorn 10 mins ago, thanks! That quest had been sitting in my inventory for months.. the Crucible awaits!
---
Well...that escalated quickly.
---
Do basically any activity. You are still under the soft cap for power, so any piece of gear you get will drop at a higher level than the gear you have equipped, so doing public events, strikes, crucible, or Gambit will give you a good boost for power to talk to Eva. Happy hunting guardian. :)
---
To take the piss , well mainly
---
This should specify that the hunter is a new light player... shoot the vents, get the orbs and go for heroic.
---
I jump off to etch my guardians limb body fall into oblivion. It‚Äôs pretty fun
---
PUT THOSE EDGE TRANSITS BACK WHERE THEY CAME FROM OR SO HELP ME
---
I‚Äòve used my dodge as a Hunter and still been hit
---
‚ÄúWarning to Civilians:
---
Guardian splash zone. 
---
Beware!‚Äù
---
- sign at the base of the tower
---
I was not wearing DuneMarchers. Titan shoulder charge has AOE but all those people there were weak so the AOE had just enough to kill them.
---
That gun is blah..  Crimson anyday over it!
---
Yup! It's retroactive, once you complete that step it should count when you reach it
---
You could also use the official D2 lfg server on discord
---
It counts as long as you get the triumph so if you reset before you get on that step it still counts.
---
I don‚Äôt get it I‚Äôm dumb titan main plez help
---
If your on console use Optative or the Ikelos HC. If your on PC use Kindled Orchid
---
I fucking soloed it and it took me around 9 hours only in the boss room, 3 spent on the final phase, at the end I wasn't sure I even wanted it, the good thing is that now I have an exotic resting in my inventory and I know that strike from memory.
---
You can pretty much read everyone's thought process in this moment lmao
---
Try a smg it worked last time when it was broke.
---
Looks like biscuit from shrek
---
Whats your power level?
---
SPEEEEEEEEN
---
That's a relief. Thank you!
---
Great. Thank you!
---
Lol, I have no problems with it.  I haven't taken the time to grind comp for it but I don't get salty if I get beat by it for that reason.  You earned it.  
---
I just thought it would be a funny meme given the salt mine that it is. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
940
---
What. WHAT? HOW!?
---
im doing all this stuff, but the thing is ALL items i get are 750, i probably got like 50 of them already , even though im lvl 2
---
just gotta tough it out, if you have jotunn use it
---
me when i hit exit to desktop
---
Eh I‚Äôm lazy
---
Calm down Karen
---
No
---
I remember sitting on a boulder in this location
---
Bro suicide is bad ass!
---
I old man coughing laughed at that
---
Tiny error in logic-- must be fake. It's perfectly possible. You're talking about a random element as a certainty, them losing motes.
---
It also could've primarily been during primeavil (or however you spell that) phases.
---
Go to the pyramidion on IO and try not to die when jumping down. Harder than you think.
---
Plus the fact that OP‚Äôs team lost the match when you add up all the Primeval damage percentages.
---
Honestly that sums up fallen captains everywhere
---
That overpowered o o f that wipes entire teams in seconds yea i love that incredibly so
---
Maybe other players don‚Äôt play crucible (especially comp) nearly as much as you guy, and they need help getting fabled. Which is why I‚Äôm offering to help him Mr. Legend. Sorry not everyone has it as easy as you
---
Can you imagine Bungie giving bosses finishers instead of that? Where over sized enemies can pick you up and squeeze the life out of you while being impervious to damage?
---
Didn't expect anything other than that from you, Good luck, have fun in games
---
Getting Recluse like: Season of Free Lube
---
Candles near Vuvuzela make you float
---
Survival (glory ranked comp matches) is the only PvP mode where you receive a penalty for losing and big penalties for quitting (can even get locked out for a time if you quit too many too frequently). No penalty for leaving any of the other crucible playlists.
---
More xp, better progress towards flash points and stuff like that, and most of them don‚Äôt take longer to do heroic than otherwise (besides drop pods on tangled shore, but those also give you tons of yellow enemies to farm for radiant seeds if you‚Äôre doing a black armory quest), so why not?
---
I will. Enjoy being banned for using cheats in other games.
---
I ended up getting Truth (I was already about to finish the quest), and it took a few matches to get it.
---
1 in 20 losses at least i dont even get to a 1KD ratio. been playing FPS since they were invented still rubbish.
---

how do i max it out i have the chalice but havent really done anything with it

You dont even need to get flawless, ive had flawless runs end with 12 minutes, ive even had a full team wipe on nokris and still hit 100k

TRUTH

His full guide for whisper is 24 min though. . .

I‚Äôm on the last part of triumph just need 40% more doubles
---
Are u sure?
---
I‚Äôm not too bothered if they do I didn‚Äôt try hard to get it
---
across the bottom of the screen when you inspect it, it should have all these lil perks that cost imperials, buy all those lil perks with imperials and there ya go, sorry if my explanations aren‚Äôt the best, just tryna hell
---
Yeah, I've noticed a lot of hackers on pc recently.
---
how do i get imperials?
---
Yeah, not a good choice of weapon for this meme
---
Just counter m8, use a fusion rifle and a scout idk m8. Not every loadout is 100% foolproof so instead of complaining, explore YOUR options and not rant about other people‚Äôs option(s).

---
We share the same problem. I'm going to upgrade my internet next year, so that the upload speed improves. Since d2 uses p2p connection, it requires a good upload and download speed. My current internet plan only has a strong download speed. 
---
A good way to see if your up speed is good is by looking at speed test. Generally, people with bad upload speeds will torrent files slowly as well
---
there‚Äôs a robot at the tower, and on nessus there is a Imperial Barge, go speak with them and it will get you on the right track, i don‚Äôt know the best way so i‚Äôd suggest lookin that one up
---
Ohh okay, thanks man
---
Heroics only appear when that planet is the flashpoint IIRC.
---
ok thank you
---
The hardest part about the quest imo... good luck and god speed towards your completion.
---
Nice! Great job man, welcome to the add clear club
---
If you use the Destiny 2 companion app, it has an LFG section. This is how I was able to get through the strike for Izanagi's pretty easily. 
---
Also, if you ever need help with anything you can always DM me! I'm a complete noob because I don't know how to clear a lot of content, but I'm always willing to help :)
---
Honestly I would just keep leveling and playing with things, finding new exotics (don't forget to visit Xur every weekend! He's a sneaky hidden vendor that only shows up on weekends and sells exotic gear for legendary shards. He shows up in a random location, and the fine folks at https://whereisxur.com/ always hunt him down and tell us where he is each week.)
---
 Sometimes just finding a new piece of exotic armor that does something unique causes me to completely change my build. You can look at all the different exotic armor and weapons in the collections menu, and while there's a fair amount of exotic guns that have specific quests to unlock them, other than Xur, you're kinda praying to rng to drop exotic armor for you.
---
Yep thx
---
Yeah, I soloq, that's unavoidable. But chances are they're gonna have a team mate that won't do much better aswell, maybe in an other game, it's a double-edged sword.
---
Blade barrage, golden gun, thunder crash, arc beam super whatever it's called, or nova bomb. Be near one of the spawn points and press button for easy win.
---
I'm not sure if you know, but if you melee the boss at around the same time as the stomp, you won't get knocked back. This works well with trench barrel shotguns and can make for some quick kills.
---
Possible reasons why this happened
---
1. Server shenanigans
---
2. Bad hotboxes
---
3. Bad aim
---
4. Spooky Spirits
---
This was the epitome of opening the microwave door when the timer has one second left at three am
---
Good job! First step to getting Unbroken and all the pinnacle weapons. :)
---
No, I didn't know you could spare him, but I still got the gun.
---
Thrillmonger, I think. You need that triumph three times over for Dredgen.
---
Yes I've heard this a few times and had a chuckle.
---
Username checks out, I guess.
---
Completing bounties for Werner-44, opening the chests on the barge on nessus. Completing the menagerie triumphs.
---
The artifact light boost is unlimited, but its baaicslly impossible once you get so high. Im pretty sure the guy that hit 999 first needed like 112 mil XP to get one more light level
---
looks like Locke from halo
---
I was just playing into the joke
---
I swear people kill him on purpose to make life worse for everyone else
---
Closest I‚Äôve come to that is me and a few randos all participating in a group huddle emote before a public event
---
I debated this but the outlaw speed reload is so damn satisfying.
---
There's a video out about doing GoS at 101 light level and most of that came from the heavy being forced. This could change the game.
---
Same, I got a pair in a darker shader.
---
link?
---
that is what I am looking for, the strike names seem to be different. I have them all, and not one says "ordeal" or "norkris"
---
There is also one on Mars, to the lower right side but it's quite rare and EP messes it up occasionally. I simply did other things while checking every few minutes for the one on titan. Wasn't THAT bad.
---
Gingy?
---
Yeah they really boost my power level
---
I got five hours 50% and a dream
---
Well if the colonel was a chicken, this should be the lieutenant
---
Yh thanks man, got the Last Word
---
That was beautiful. Did you have dunemarchers on?
---
Same roll I got. 
---
It looks cool. Only reason I didn't shard it.
---
No problem. If you have any questions then feel free to ask. Illa.answer the best to my ability. Happy grinding!
---
That one sucks too
---
I had someone do this for me a day ago!  It was just the two of us doing a glimmer extraction PE. He fired a few rounds into my head to get my attention (I have no mic), then very deliberately showed me what to shoot at before I went ham on mobs - even kept looking back to see I got it. We beat the heroic and I did what I could with my limited emotes to show my gratitude haha. Now I hang back when I do an unfamiliar PE to watch and see what the experienced players are doing before I go in firing. Big thanks to all you guys who go out of your way to teach us!
---
Happy cake day fellow redditor!
---
No recommendations from me, I just want to add my 2¬¢ about raid guides. 
---
It bugs me that we get 20 guides in the first day for a new raid as every streamer races to get the first guides out there but then none of them seem to get updated. Almost all the guides you can find about any raid are the first things that worked for teams, not necessarily what works best.
---
Can you still get obsidian Crystal's even if your not on that quest step
---
Now its eithervmy luck is shit or something is actually wrong but im never getting any exotic from the nightfalls I've played. Adept and the one after
---
1.equip it
---
2. go to Iron Banner
---
3. grab every heavy brick
---
4. watch the enemy player confused about not dying despite being directly hit by a rocket
---
I would love if a boss ripped me in half like Deadpool‚Äôs juggernaut
---
Daddy shaxx giving us guardians all the approval and encouragement we never got from our fathers &lt;3
---
This post gave me cancer.
---
Yeah you need two others that have the quest or have finished it
---
Go solo. You would be surprise.
---
This season is actually pretty easy. A win gives you like 160 points or something and a loss is -10?
---
Let's get dangerous...
---
its not
---
Hey I know this is old but, this is still the dumbest fucking quest I've ever seen.  It's literally nothing but making you jump through hoops before you can redeem tokens *that you've already earned*.  The first time I did it I thought "Oh, fuck, look at that, the progress is cumulative even when you don't have the steps.  This would've been way easier if I had known that!"
---
But guess what guys.  The steps AREN'T fucking cumulative!  The capture ones are, but the weapon ones aren't, so none of the FR kills that I got before getting to that step actually counted.  Wow, thanks Bunghole.  Now I have to get 20 fucking kills with this weapon that spawns with 2 ammo and that everybody else is also shooting back at me at all times -- except they're all about 10 levels higher than me for some reason even though I'm 950 already.  Which somehow means that they can kill me from across the fucking map with the exact same weapon that I'm using, but if I'm more than three feet away from them it'll take me at least two shots to kill them.
---
Who the fuck came up with this?  That person should be fired, out of a goddamn cannon and into the sun.
---
Don't know if I can tell you because of spoilers, so SPOILER ALERT basically The Iron Lords and The Lords of War went pillaging and raided the village he was living in, and not only his village, killing all it's habitants
---
Awesome! Fighting Lion is actually a blast in PvE, it has great crowd control if you get used to the whole hold/release to detonate gimmick, it's a lot of fun (:
---
Hahaha, that playlist was there since the launch of shadowkeep. And don't get too attached to KD... As long as you are playing as a team, helping your teammates and having fun you are on a good spot. Also, don't be that guy that leaves the match in the middle rage quitting because of got some sweaty Lord's
---
Thanks too!
---
Armor : Wormhusk Crown, Shards of Galanor, Sixth Coyote, StompEE5
---
Weapons : Bad Juju, Riskrunner (tho I really wished Tarrabah was better, it looks so sick), whatever heavy I wanna run with
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
And yeah just stack up Intelligence, Paragon and Dynamo mods, safely dodging around and getting my Blade Barrage in the blink of an eye
---
Okay thank you all!
---
So, correct me if i'm wrong, but if he buys the season pass at this stage, he still needs to grind out the 100 lvls to get the rewards?
---
Maybe I'm just reading it wrong.

Nice, 3 shards.

I think its less "whats op and getting kills" and more just "what people are using for reasons" a lot of people are tryi f to get their Randy's right now, hence the scout usage
---
It‚Äôs a very *very* situational 1HK
---
Does the clan have a discord or anything?
---
I was waiting for the cat to turn it off. Idk if PS4 has this issue, but my friends dogs have done it on xbox. A light breeze hits that power button and it'll turn off.
---
Honestly, this is completely on the guy that died. He had heavy with plenty of time to backpedal and get to a better spot or the capture point if it came up. Just had to bait OP out into the open, but he started chasing the kill. I love shoulder charging titans in comp because it‚Äôs fairly predictable.

I usually have incredible luck when it come to destiny but I just can‚Äôt get the exotics I want 
---
:( only dupes  and annoying ones
---
I mean I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a guardian sex shop somewhere out there in the city.. I would imagine an exo could literally just walk in and buy an.. ‚Äúattachment‚Äù if you will.
---
Good call. I was running this setup because my boys can't do damage for shit.

Oh luckily I have destiny downloaded on my PS4, he has pressed the disc eject button a few times üòÇüòÇ

Nope. He gets all the rewards cuz he got to lvl 100

Ya, I grinded out for that Werewolf and used it for ten minutes, pretty skin though.  I am aware of rampage, I do not have the perk.  Do I just reacquire it until I get the rampage perk?  I got the Duty Bound with Rampage, it's tight, but, it doesn't have the stopping power I was looking for in the Halfdan.
---
Re-Acquire is the coolest feature.
---
Damn good rifle.
---
Shadow keep and foresaken
---
So if in at any given time something NSFW transpires, everything is cool.  Or you're talking about your favorite weapon, idk.  Things can get off color.
---
Yeah ok, that sounds a lot better. Had a little wtf moment when i read it. Just wanted to get it straight. 
---
Thanks.
---
I'd love to see what game(s) they actually play.
---
Actually, you can damage him before the legs light up. But those are crit spots and will do much more damage
---
I‚Äôd like to also add that a lot of other people I have met that have been flawless also cannot re acquire the shaders.
---
&gt; Oh and they also give them cocks and vaginas as well as breasts too
---
Please tell me you made this up
---
I suppose
---
I somehow got a Monte Carlo from one of the season pass exotic engrams on my warlock but literally No1 believed me. Fuuuuck my ass I will film them from now on
---
Probably more shits than giggles
---
They did not pillage the town, I don't know what gave you that idea. The drifter said that the iron Lord's went to the town he was living in to set a trap for the Warlords who they knew would eventually come there. The inseuing battle had many human causualties. The iron Lord's were the "good guys" in the dark ages
---
I think mainly its players doing the floor is lava challenge
---
It means multiple kills in very quick succession. For some things in game it means 2, for others it means 3. I think for the BA frames it means 3.
---
Good laugh ty.

Welcome back GUARDIAN! (SHAXX VOICE)
---
welcome to Destiny 2, there's just 1 tiny detail u missed, blueberrys also don't care about heroic public events
---
That shit falls on me like 50 times a week.
---
To use the 5 of swords, don‚Äôt select The Ordeal, select the nightfall on the right side of the screen.
---
The way I did it was forge runs.
---
Nah skullfort shoulder charge is perfectly balance
---
Leading cause of death in districts around the tower is ‚Äúcrushed by falling Titan‚Äù
---
Ah yes, the crappiest of weapons, no weapons.
---
One of the bigger complaints I have about this game as a semi-new player. The game doesn't teach you about heroic events what-so-ever. And the in-game community more often than not won't either. I only learned about them from memes like this on reddit. I understand people bitch and moan about reposts but please god believe me when I say that they teach new players, as it's about the ONLY place to learn these things.
---
Edit: As a side note, the wiki's for this game are god awful. Somehow less informative than the game itself.
---
but how will the guardians know about i?
---
Have you tried combining 3 blues at Amanda? Not sure if you could get stuff that doesn't show, or what's all attainable that way. But if you have spare mats just take 3 of the same blue transmat to Amanda and she'll convert them to random legendaries. Could possible include Drop Pod
---
To make what possible?
---
Guardian, reports from Ishtar Sink, Venus?
---
whereisxur.com will be to your help finding him
---
For me my lobbies are usually me crushing people and maybe 1 or 2 decent people on their team if they are lucky
---
It took me six weeks to get one... good luck!
---
Yes they do I did the garden world ordeal strike last week and got the ship (which is the loot for that strike) for two different runs but both were 100k runs getting that score might give you a better drop chance üëçüèæ
---
On pc you can't do a strike solo, unfortunately. Console can change date, but on pc we're stuck with matchmaking
---
That's pretty impressive. Good Work!
---
That would be a signature move if this was breakdancing
---
Just embrace it, don‚Äôt try to linear the entire thing into an order. Total immersion. If it s a blue crown symbol, it‚Äôs part of the campaign you‚Äôre on. If it‚Äôs a red legion mark, it‚Äôs RL legion campaign. Rasputin‚Äôs symbol is warmind campaign. Take it slow,enjoy it.

Bungie hasn't finished things connected to the armour 2.0 system. So Xur is pulling from Collections for everything. So is menagerie. And collections seems to have been rushed and is still a work in progress
