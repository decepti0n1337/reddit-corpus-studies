Listen dude, you are litterally the odd man out here. I'm on this page and the forums quite a bit and while I haven't seen ANY posts saying people wanted the enhancement cores completely removed (other then yours) I have seen A LOT of posts about the scarcity of enhancement cores in the game, and that's exactly what bungie is fixing in this next season they will be adding more ways to get cores. Honestly though there are MUCH bigger issues in this game then not being able to level up to max at Mach 10 and be max level in 3 days. I went from 650 on my PC account to 700 in a little over 2 weeks. It really isn't hat hard to do. Now if bungie wanted to fix the fact that there are only 5 destination armors sets with perks out of 20 possible sets, Or the fact that ALL but two of the raid armors don't have perks either. This is content players have paid MONEY for with curse of Osiris and warminds along with all the other armor in the game. Not wanting enhancement cores is just a personal gripe of yours and you need to get over it dude it's part of the game and they aren't going to be removing it. all your math proved was that it takes alot of cores to reach max light. But it's not impossible. Stop bitching cuz after next season starts I'm sure you will be singing a different tune.
---
---
---
PSA: Bungie doesn't do these kind of things. We've been asking for a servitor ghost since solstice of heroes and have yet to get it.
---

---
We wanted a "Ghost" ghost and didn't get it in the Halloween event. These things don't happen.
---
We already left the raid so i cant do either :(
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
D‚Äôoh! 
---
BRING BACK VALGARDE 
---
Now some thrall and add a bit of confused screaming and now we have a deal 
---
I mean the Queen created it to be the most beautiful place in the universe as her very own realm, so, yeah, it‚Äôs pretty
---
You'll know if he comes out head first üòÇ.
---
The hunter on your team besides the mask looks good asf tho
---
Any company who runs a live service depends on maximizing play time to be honest.
---
Lmao don't solo que
---
That‚Äôs what I do with them. Although I consider it sharing lol. This one may be nsfw (too much so)
---
Play with a better team with a mindset to win.
---
I don't want to look at a Shrieker unless I'm killing it... Not after Chasm of Screams...
---
Eek
---
How do you know how many kills you've put on the weapon? I can't find a tracker
---
People who play A LOT get to widen the gap even more between their gear and the gear of people who don't.  That's pretty much it.  And at this stage of the game, I'd say the majority of players left are those who play A LOT.
---
The Dreaming City Auto-Rifle, The Gambit Pulse-Rifle, and the Vanguard Pulse-Rifle are quite good. The Ikelos handcannon is fairly good in the energy slot. Most handcannons with a higher fire-rate are pretty reliable.
---
Yeah a full team of OEM is scary and all but if you see this you know you know you‚Äôre about to get your ass smacked
---
I say we should bring tea-bagging back
---
Both exotics there arent really going to help in pvp, a few warlocks i know run transversive steps (any subclass) or skull of dire ahamkara (on void) with weapons its really up to practice but id recommend a HC or scout or pulse rife with a shotgun (preferably precision frame) really its preferance though and what you prefer to use :)
---
Every Hunter in this game is red/black.
---
I‚Äôm the same way. I tend to get pretty easily upset, so when I get teabagged I actually have to take a minute and remember that it shouldn‚Äôt really affect me. Yeah maybe I messed up or the other player got the best of me. If it continually keeps happening, especially with the same person, then I just ignore it cuz that‚Äôs a personal choice on their part. All I can do is focus on playing better, playing smarter, knowing when to engage, time to kill with the weapons and abilities I‚Äôm using. Map positions, all that fun stuff. Negativity is always gonna exists. Try not to let it discourage you.
---
I dismantled a vaults worth of armor and weapons, guess what I kept? üòâ
---
Do you know if gear backgrounds are Galaxy watch compatible?
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it hasn‚Äôt gone anywhere. 
---
I believe you meant, THIS IS AMAZING!!
---
I‚Äôm still holding out hope for an exotic Chest-piece for warlocks that spawns shrieker death blasts on death, and allows grenade to be consumed to create a mini-shrieked turret. 
---
Forsaken contains Curse of Osiris, Warmind, Forsaken, and one level 30 character boost. It is highly recommended to buy this. 
---
The annual pass contains three smaller DLCs released after Forsaken, over the course of a year. Right now, only part of it has been released, but it's not possible to buy the three parts of this one separately. They are all extra things to do after Forsaken, so it isn't strictly necessary to get the annual pass unless you know you will be playing **a lot**. 
---
Sounds like you have the best possible loadout. 
---
"Oooh purple ammo-"
---
*Guardian down.*
---
Happens here too
---
I felt this :C
---
Good god
---
Where are you I wanna come use that loadout
---
Lol what?
---
All the while, Diablo 2 is staring in at us through a window, forlornly
---
That happens to me with anything using that mechanic it‚Äôs so annoying üòÇ
---
Or Div2
---
Traveller needs to be in the bottom right square. 
---
I meant the super, which is basically akin to being nuked
---
[Here's are the quest steps for the Acrius.](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-01-19-destiny-2-world-eater-quest-legend-of-acricus-4747) Can you confirm that the current objective listed in your inventory is asking you to do the, "End the Arms Dealer" special strike?
---
You mean the Leviathan raid right I was wondering this earlier today it is under the whole Nessus map in the directory
---
Can‚Äôt help if we can‚Äôt read the description and objective 
---
Good to know.
---
I think there should be grind for elite level items.  But not for leveling, power level, or infusion. 
---
You NEED more casual players to spend money and keep the game alive. If they all leave no matter how hardcore the elite group is they can‚Äôt finally support the game. 
---
yeah, didn't start playing D2 until november and I guess that means fuck me right?
---
It sucks how some weapons are unusable on console due to crazy recoil compared to pc
---
One eyed mask, feedback fences, dragons shadow, stompees
---
I wish they removed cores but increase glimmer and other material costs slightly. That way it‚Äôs not unlimited infusion but it‚Äôs also not a big worry. 
---
Or swap cores for legendary fragments. Those they can charge 5 per infusion and it‚Äôs not a bad deal. 
---
For something so central to the story, one of us is one too many.
---
I'll tell you what I did and it seemed to make a difference, go to orbit to make your keys, and if your after the four weapons only open one schematic a day, this worked for me. 
---
I have 3 of those sitting in my inventory. Are they better now?
---
There both right 
---
I love this meme, I should watch this show.
---
Buff sweet business? I think it's long overdue
---
I get an aneurysm.
---
Night Watch, J√∂ttun, 21D
---
Yes. Actually yes.
---
I agree, but we all know people will never fully understand that. An easier solution would be to remove them from infusion completely (kind of like how it was before) and there wouldn't be an issue. With so many things to do in the game now after you hit max light (god rolls to obtain, pinnacle weapons, collecting triumphs, etc.), hitting max light should be the beginning of the end game and not the endgame itself. They originally names them masterwork cores for a reason, I don't see why they can't just take a step back and act on what a lot of people want. Hell, increase the cost for masterworks even more (masterworking gear was cheaper even before cores were used for infusion as well) and just increase the bonuses. Make them an end game item again.
---
How about a paid emote called ‚Äúdrop boughs‚Äù. It costs 5 Baryon Boughs to trigger and does [this dance](https://youtu.be/rEEc8xjxrSA)
---
Lol!  I love it. 
---
Understandable. However, it would be nice to get a short text only post closer to the daily reset. Just so people know where he is while you guys prepare the usual pinned post regarding his wares. Something you can delete shortly after.
---
They're too weak. That's why.
---
You‚Äôre simply bad. 
---
Agreed 
---
Yeah like Civ5
---
Yep! The app is called WatchMaker. To use this skin you'll need WatchMaker Premium, which is a one off payment of $2 I think? Then you can most custom made watch faces. 
---
Cayde-6 should have had one of those

I just call it /2

I just wish there were more enemies. I run through because I know the encounter is gonna be so quick and easy anyway, that it isn‚Äôt worth stopping.

If I know I‚Äôm not gonna be competing just to be able to get a shot in at the enemy before it dies then I‚Äôll slow down and take my time

Well I got the answer I wanted. You are entitled to your opinion of the perks, and while I disagree I'm not in this for an argument. Keep on keeping on with the memes, I enjoy them.
---
Edit: Had to try a simpler design and increase the size of the print. I also got rid of the text option for an easier print. It was the difference between having a hideous, tiny box that didn't work properly or have something good to show.

Let's agree to disagree yes? And thanks, will do.
---
I can't create, but this would be a good use of the "Population drops to 0" meme
---
I did some maths yesterday and I found this answer:  
---
The only thing I play is D2 + the fact that I love this game and would kill for Forsaken = I would have to watch Cayde die 3 times  
---
*By the time I watched him die on my Warlock I think I would go mentally insane. Btw I'm a level 20 ;p standstrong fellow ones!*
---
We got a deal
---
Aw man
---
It‚Äôs heart breaking
---
Nope. It's in the pool for notorious engrams this season
---
*Chuckles* I'm in danger.
---
I cant wait till we get to d4, and all three series are at the same number.
---
This is true.
---
this sir, is really cursed
---
Still better than when you first try the strike by yourself and can't even get to the first door
---
do the forge twice?
---
Alongside crucible, gambit, and strikes, this would be the pinnacle meme
---
What mod do you use with recluse?
---
You need to complete 5 of spiders bounties in order to unlock the adventures (baron missions). The tangled shore bounties, not the wanted bounties. I hope this fixes your issue.
---
I have been sitting next to a node, and had it be the next one crafted.
---
So not sure if this advice is sound.
---
Cool but, i don't wanted to be reminded of "Hive! Bring a sword!" and thinking "I have mere seconds before the add-pocolypse..."
---
Back in the Festival of The Lost Event last year
---
Had the same thing happening to me but i survived. 
---
CAUSE I THROW ENOUGH GRENADES!!
---
He had to have completed the prison of elders and talked to ikora and zavala at the tower as well as completed high plains blues in order to get to spider.
---
Do you mean the plasma shell or arch shell? I must be blind because I cannot find the servitor shell you speak of
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm a little dusty on the mission order for the Forsaken campaign since I did it a while ago. I just can‚Äôt pinpoint where he is based on the descriptions he‚Äôs provided. 
---
I still hate it how planetary material is required in infusion
---
I use radar tuner personally because I rush a lot in qp into groups so the faster I can get a read on the other team the better.  I know a lot of people run backup mag but it barely increases the mag at all.
---
Is it possible to still get the mountaintop quest? I really want it.
---
That was me a while back, but the set kinda grew on me. The gauntlet especially look pretty nice with a darker shader like the black armory one. Pair it with the new eververse cloak and you look like a comfy steampunk vagabond lol
---
One More Time!
---
Me too, i just pulled up the forsaken campaign guide on google to help me remember lol.
---
Heres the link:
---
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.shacknews.com/article/107055/destiny-2-forsaken-campaign-walkthrough%3famphtml=1
---
it‚Äôs in the loot pool, got my first a few weeks ago from a nightfall
---
I think the only thing we have no confirmation of Guardians doing is getting laid, at least until Shaxx stops teasing us.
---
Excuse me what the fuck
---
Oh get off your high horse man. 
---
I'd really like to know what armor he has on
---
Gotta do the forge twice my man
---
10/10 would smash.
---
Dragon Shadow is the greatest neutral exotic that allows for the best PVP neutral build. The Wraithmail Perk provides:
---
* Reloads all weapons. Which means you change your dodge to Gambler‚Äôs Dodge for melee regen. 
---
* Increases weapon reload speed. No need to run reload armor perks. 
---
* Increases handling speed. Basically gives you snap shot and quick draw for all your weapons. 
---
* Increases movement. 
---
 * Gives +5 mobility. So you can spec your armor at base 5 and dump the rest into resilience and recovery. Mobility provides faster strafe, crouch, and walk speed in all directions (while hip firing and ADS). 
---
 * Mobility also increases you initial jump height. 
---
 * Increases sprint speed and slide length. Not to the extent of stompees, but still good. 
---
Wraithmail lasts for 10 seconds after dodging. 5 paragon mods gives you the dodge back in 9.something for 100% uptime. If you spec 4 I think there is a 2 second delay after the perk deactivates. 
---
Has two great subclass builds to run with:  
---
* Way of The Wind Arcstrider: Focused Breathing gives you Increases sprint speed and recharged your dodge while sprinting. It also makes you harder to hit while dodging and breaks any aim assist. 
---
* Spectral Blades. This class is obviously strong AF in PvP. A great thing about Dragon shadow is you run it until you super is up then do an easy switch to Gwisen Vest since it‚Äôs a one slot swap. 
---
I don‚Äôt know what information you have or where you got it, but 99% of high caliber crucible players run one of these builds. The only other exotic they are using besides the Gwisen/DS combo is stompees for the vertical game.  
---
Skullfort and middle tree arc. Or run Hammerhead like 90% of people do.
---
#Now that's alot of nerfs
---
Yeah but I‚Äôm not getting them when I finish the bounty. They don‚Äôt show up in my characters load out or anywhere. 
---
It's no big deal, son. Get in the food processor. 
---
Open  Xur engrams until you get it
---
I do have a forge completed 
---
I mean, the same was LITERALLY said about Destiny 2, and still is by some of the game's more ardent haters.
---
Dragon's Shadow is one of the best pvp exotics in the game. It gives insane neutral game buffs.
---
No, i mean you have to go do a forge to get each weapon .
---
Ah you‚Äôre right. Thank you!
---
It‚Äôs a feature...
---
&gt;Diablo 2
---
I did mine last week? Pretty sure before reset..so I‚Äôm screwed having to wait now? Wtf...
---
This would be nice
---
It is not
---
This has been a thing with any item requiring a slide/timed activation
---
Happens on PC all the time
---
Most likely a server latency issue
---
Idk, I‚Äôll give it a try! Can‚Äôt hurt anything! 
---
Actually, The Division 2 is known as TD2.....so, this meme is invalid. 
---
Doom 2
---
Yeah doesn‚Äôt it buff handling, reload and movement speed for like 10 seconds too?
---
First to reach 101, but still lost...good ol' crucible
---
Why is it getting downvoted? Do people not consider this a problem? One of you downvoters please enlighten me.
---
ITS SO DAMN TRUE.
---
TCTD 2
---
I believe Emilo Estevez and company are next in line to mention their 90's sequel to the Mighty Ducks. D2: The Mighty Ducks
---
Lmao, plz don't nerf.
---
And also Div2.
---
I like tD2
---
Working on my 2nd character now. Doing story missions is miserable and I'm not even on the unbearably long Forsaken story line yet. 
---
That's why I call the drifter "space Asian Matthew McConaughey".
---
Not right now man... Div2 is awesome and D2 has a bad dlc with little content
---
So the weapon generates orbs and (depending on the weapon) gets that extra bonus to a stat. Admittedly, I haven't played this game for even a year yet, but I've come quite a long way, and I don't see the big deal. Save. Spend rationally. It's simple.
---
just close all other applications to see if it help
---
Someone give that man a cookie.
---
Thisssssssss! Ffs (ties a noose around neck)
---
Just like titanfall 2 and team fortress 2
---
I'm so sick of warlock gauntlets, I've got loads of them! And no I'm not getting rid of my karnstein armlets even if I'm a void walker! 
---
THIS IS AMAZING!
---
F
---
*it was for a good cause*
---
This is more or less identical to people calling football "soccer"
---
Yeah. I might miss that the most. It was so silly awsome.
---
Oh man, it's so refreshing not to have another ("me when I'm holding 20 motes and someone invades / it do be like that") post.
---
And it's *actually funny* too!
---
It‚Äôll be 100k upvotes....... then they‚Äôll nerf it!! 
---
Mod slot?
---
No mod slot I just checked. 
---
Context, dude. During CoO the game was almost void of content and the DLC was as disappointing as it gets. 
---
Now the game has plenty of content and there is no need to artificially stretch every grind to infinity and beyond.
---
#Am I a joke to you?
---
Love it! Hope this feature carries on in D3. Its been happening since D1üòÇ
---
Shaxx gon give it to ya
---
It‚Äôs good in PvE too. 
---
It‚Äôs only a ‚ÄúPvP weapon‚Äù because of the PvP milestone... which I‚Äôm saying should be removed. 
---
Ohhhh good idea. Don‚Äôt have imgur tho so probably not worth. One of you guys can cash in on some upvotes if you like though, my treat!
---
It may be good in pve but what I'm saying is that it is designed for crucible. Also this is the second exotic with a mandatory PvP step.
---
i just go by Div2, easier to know the difference since i play both games.
---
Should call it /2 ie √∑2 ie divide 2.
---
Oh, this is great!
---
the winter wolf drops from the engrams that can drop whenever you use your resonate stems and open a node
---
I wish they had a daily for Prime tbh
---
I am so painfully aware. Every engram since warmind has been a scout or sniper and honestly I'm starting to want to use one on ana
---
It‚Äôs red war
---
They only drop from schematics that you can get out of the sleeper nodes. You should be farming resonate stems. RNG is a bitch.
---
I‚Äôll add one 
---
Dune 2 wants to have a word with you whipper-snappers.
---
That‚Äôs the thing I can name every missing exotic I have not got
---
I‚Äôve opened two and only got stuff I have
---
Nice ! How do you make motion tracking text in your video ?
---
That would make sense
---
If I was gonna do it, I would have had already. The meme doesn't say "it was so hard to get those shaders!" but you had to grind a lot for those as opposed to srl shaders.
---
I did and all I‚Äôm missing is forsaken exotics
---
not really grind, chatterwhite and queens web easy, i got nanopoesis from a single hard wrath run, but the kingsfall shader, damn, did it 10 or so times to get it
---
Thank you for worrying, but I don't nolife it. 1-2 hours per day, more on weekends.
---
also the shaders. wtf is going on?
---
do you have a gold/orange gambit coin in your pursuits inventory? That's the quest you have to do to get the allegiance quest iirc
---
No.
---
The fact this guy thinks he can dictate and determine how people play is beyond me.
---
I'm right there with you friend
---
Very true and we have malfeasance for taken and skyburner's oath for cabal but not really any vex or fallen/scorn weapons. 
---
all too real lmao
---
If you're running telesto then you want vex every time. Minotaurs are destroyed and the shield blast takes care of surrounding vex
---
Ahaha! That's perfect
---
No we were fighting the primes by this point just killing the 3rd envoy and there wasn‚Äôt anything special about this one in particular.  
---
I never had any exotics from d1 but I'd love to experience them reborn or simply remastered or just reintroduced. 
---
thank you. monte was just a beautiful gun with not bad perks. hands down my favorite gun in d1üôÇ
---
May the better game prevail
---
Any gun that can shoot takes care of them.
---
Oh yes so that's all but I meant we don't have a specific weapon that excels for each enemy. 
---
D2 and TD2....
---
I play both.... can't use the same for both lol.
---
We might. One day.
---
*instant erection*
---
That BB toss was sick, you hit all 3 servitors
---
Hopefully some day we remember being a great day. 
---
Adobe After Effects. Plenty easy to follow tutorials of how to do it on YouTube :)
---
I have every exotic. I am not sure why I go see him every week. Maybe its his good looks? Or his easy banter? 
---
I agree with his sentiment... Bungie is completely missing the point, or actively ignoring it.
---
Annual pass is like dlc for the entire year. Black armory finished with season 5 and we‚Äôre in season of the drifter, season 6 currently. If you plan on playing the game the whole year then it‚Äôs worth it. If not, then it‚Äôs not really.
---
Destiny 2 should definitely be replaced by division 2 the way things are going. But I might be in the wrong sub for this..
---
As a shout I forgot to complain about the Objectively Better Than's like One Eyed Mask, Ophidian Aspect and Stompees that literally only bump something that already exists and how they're, while strong, ridiculously lazy design.
---
I had a hearty chuckle at this. Well done!
---
It‚Äôs got a great personality!
---
Kill them 
---
what happens in the crucible isnt meant for the outside world 
---
Not even with your face? Not very Titan of you......
---
Snitch
---
Possibly the DFA handcannon
---
Ugh. Giving me ptsd over running from novas in Crucible and having them follow me around corners and chase me down haha. 
---
Also, what was that hand cannon / where do you get it?
---
Me and my brother game regularly together. We decided to go back and try destiny 2 about a month ago, have not been able to put it down. The forsaken dlc has been amazing and is probably the most I've has playing since destiny one the taken campaign.
---
It's Division 1 with a few minor changes. Everyone went through a phase with it too where they just loved it. Then it died. Division 2 will do the same in time.
---
Is it a really cool weapon? Probably not that good on solo play?
---
Remember the ship?
---
I'm not trying to flex I'm just trying to see how many people collect went out of their way to obtain this lore early than intended 
---
Damn so they boosted the amount of points u get overall?
---
Yeeeaaaaahhhh I never got it. 
---
I have tried it, and its pretty boring.
---
I got it when I stopped expecting it after +60 runs with lfgs haha it's still equipped on my hunter to this day
---
Fosho?
---
Yea, that cape is one of my favorites and you're right.  I wish there was a shader you could apply that would black out the spider symbol.
---
As much as I would love for that I think this was unintentional and Bungie meant for us to wait 9 weeks for the whole lore book.
---
The division 2 is so good that it‚Äôs probably better than destiny 2. But destiny got a different core all together. I wish bungie would learn from them. 
---
Idiot! Savage! Division 2 is a five star game!  
---
  
---
But seriously, compare vanilla Division 2 to vanilla Destiny 2 and it's not even funny how much better it is. With the FREE dlc coming out for it, it makes Destiny 2 Forsaken seem like a cashgrab ripoff. RSPCA looking at Curse of Osiris which *WAS* a cashgrab ripoff.
---
I remember this being the first exotic I ever got and - of course - was very excited and mained it always.
---
Then my buddy invited my noob self on a raid and as soon as I rez'd in, ALL of the other internet strangers on the raid cursed me out and then worked together to shove me off a cliff so I wouldn't mess up their perfection. 
---
People are great.
---
What's wrong with that main ingredient? Is gotta big ol nose. 
---
Don't forget Doom: Eternal
---
Might try r/fireteams 
---
You'll wanna check out /r/Fireteams, our LFG thread on the sidebar, and also the Team-up Tuesday megathread on /r/DestinyTheGame. Good resources! 
---
Can't post here though - - Rule 13. 
---
Had to be him, someone else might have gotten it wrong :( 
---
Yeah, they increased the points for winning a match this season too
---
Destiny 2 had to be completely reworked 6 months before launch because Activision wanted to add more micro-transactions.
---
Okay so you obviously dont know how to read, you're having a hard time so you're coming to reddit to just be a prick on people's post, 
---
No, i want new guns. Tired of the same shit we had in D1.
---
You don‚Äôt have the fully upgraded version yet. Finish the quest steps and you‚Äôre good üëç
---
I'm only 2 out of 3 for that one. üòÇ I just don't know how to do it any faster. 
---
Oh okay thank you 
---
I'm confused, what does bungie know?
---
Which feels wrong,  le monarque feels so good
---
Finally went for mine yesterday, it wasn't bad even when loading in solo queue. 
---
more like anthem can stand up and run away and jump into a pool filled with sharks
---
I basically just kept running Wrath consistently until I got Outbreak. After that I only it played here and there. All I wanted was that shader, and I‚Äôd kill to have it for every Destiny game until the franchise ends. During the first Crimson Days in D2 I thought that red one would be what I needed, but then I found out it has that ugly pink gold triangle pattern on most stuff like capes, and more importantly Warlock robes. 
---
Surprisingly, I got all mine aggressively grinding the Massacre medals. Just shooting 10 telestos in there will generate a lot of motes that I try to pick up in one shot. 
---
If that bow was ace you would have killed them like 5x faster
---
It helps the other team :p haha 
---
Is that bayonet longer than the gun?
---
Why not both?
---
I‚Äôd be concerned if it *didnt* do leas damage than ace with mori.
---
can't be helped, i don't think it's explained anywhere inside the strike that you have the kill the knights and can't just 1 phase the boss. every other special strike has to the best of my knowledge simply been kill the boss and don't die.
---
I feel you
---
Last Wish and Scourge Of The Past. Leviathan won‚Äôt drop anything above 380, and is only relevant now for Acrius, Telesto Catalyst, and the Sleeper Catalyst.
---
Yes
---
Of all the helmets to re use why an ugly looking blue helmet?
---
Worth a play for forsaken, the new expansions are a bore imo
---
Hahaha 
---
Damn, how do you have time to grind cores while being a smartass here?  You might not get those 3 today!
---
Thanks for being a tool.
---
Random exotic drop from year one you have a chance to get it from cuts exotic engram 
---
1 thing that exist for hunter is:
---
Dodge to get your melee back
---
Melee enemy to get your dodge back and health regen
---
If you have some get ability/super energy on melee kills/hits(not sure right now), you can kind of have something like this.
---
But you are correct the combos are not that impactful on gameplay.
---
The Itemization is just not on par with other looter games and i hope we get something similar to those in the next Destiny game.
---
It‚Äôs what got me through the PvP portion of the Thorn quest. The IKELOS one is ass, it‚Äôs reload is awful for its low mag size. 
---
Division 2 is equal to Forsaken Imo. Both are fantastic. 
---
/r/karmacourt!
---
CIRCA 2019*
---
Play stupid games win stupid prizes 
---
I love all these people with the collector perk, I can kill them and steal their motes
---
Just wait until you get genesis on a kinetic weapon
---
"I see you copied my cape." 
---
Still better than match game
---
Like why couldn‚Äôt they use the Hardcase helm!? I use it to this day because it‚Äôs like the most D1 looking of all Titan helms! It‚Äôs clean, simple with its huge visor, and looks great with every shader
---
Yeah. But no, instead we get that pathetic looking one that, with most shaders, it only shades the tiny little V!
---
That people ‚Äúwhine‚Äù about Crucible
---
I know, because it‚Äôs that serious üôÑ
---
I played Forsaken and came back right before Joker Wild, the game is in an amazing place. Tons to do, lots of avenues to earn powerful gear and Black Armory is a blast. 
---
I've been splitting time between Division 2 and Destiny 2.  Basically they took everything they had done right with Division 1 and continued improving.  
---
It has a lot of content, haven't encountered many bugs.  Haven't reached the endgame yet but so far yes I'd say it is quite good.
---
Soon
---
Well you‚Äôll just get two drops next time you do the raid
---
I thing the fighting lion would be really cool in this style too!
---
Heh. Eye balls.
---
Why not Zoidberg?
---
too bad division 2 out of the box is a far better game than destiny 2 out of the box.
---
Because Bungo can't do two things at once. The exotic pool is already flooded with useless exotic weapons as it is. Flooding it with both old and new will only make it worse. 
---
I can hear Cayde turning over in his grave
---
i use div2 because i play both and get confused
---
Riskrunner for fallen. It's not exactly meant for fallen but dregs, vandals, wraiths and shanks all do arc damage and captains have arc shields.
---
You can access one raid, Leviathan, once you are power level 290. It is definitely possible to do the Leviathan raid without DLC, given that it was in the game at launch, before any DLC existed. 
---
Leviathan appears on the Nessus world map, near the bottom. [This post has a lot of good advice for new raiders.](https://old.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/ap9f3s/tips_for_new_players_that_want_to_start_raiding/)
---
Oh damn, I was so scared I was the one in this clip. I died in the same area to a Nova bomb once. The invader had been gone for a second or 2 and I just jumped out to run towards the middle and jumped right into the path of a nova bomb... It was like a horror movie. 
---
yup, the mission is available as weekly story mission. I thin it's called "Last Call". 
---
Yes and im hoping its a good roll or else I dont know how much longer I can wait until its sold again lol 
---
I mean, they're both annoying and painful to deal with.
---
Solo Div2 is pretty challenging sometimes 
---
D2 solo is a much more even experiance
---
The impossible perk combo
---
Tuesdays at 10 am PST, 1 pm EST, or whatever that is in your time zone. Everything weekly resets at this time. 
---
I don't believe faction reward engrams ever reset. Your progress toward them also doesn't reset. 
---
Missions don't reset for the most part either, except for the unique case of the three Dreaming City missions. They reset on Tuesdays, with every other weekly thing. 
---
By "keys in the sewers," do you mean Leviathan keys? Those also reset on Tuesdays. 
---
Oh thanks
---
I‚Äôm more concerned with the armor from the raids actually looking like the enemies from that raid. Like I was hoping when D2 launched that we‚Äôd get some Cabal themed armor. Instead we just got stuff that‚Äôs based off random races we‚Äôve never seen that Calus brought into his shadows. 
---
its pvp is not. Division 2 is just about grinding story missions and collecting loot to improve your effectiveness at story missions. the multiplayer does not even conpare to destiny's
---
It's okay to like a game my man. All looters have spongy enemies in them. I dont see where I was bitching about it. It's okay to like other games. One game doesnt have to rule them all it's a silly concept and these two games attract very different audiences. Enjoy brotha 
---
Mentioning everting that‚Äôs worth imo 
---
Leviathan: 
---
Midnight coup
---
Inaugural address
---
Acrius, Telesto, and sleeper catalyst
---
Last wish: 
---
1k voices
---
Nation of beasts curated
---
Chattering bone (you can get ricochet rounds with range finder, pretty good for pvp) 
---
Transfiguration (good in long range maps or scouting in pve, favorite roll is chambered compensator/drop mag/rampage/ambitious assassin)
---
The supremacy (imo best pvp sniper next to Vite of the Fox and twilight oath) 
---
Scourge: 
---
No feelings (with box breathing, it can 3 crit in pvp, and is also pretty good in pve) 
---
THREAT LEVEL CURATED
---
Anarchy
---
*laughs in death blast* 
---
I am having fun playing solo. It has a bit of a challenge to it when solo since you need to learn how to position yourself during fights. I prefer playing the story solo due to wanting to go at my own pace instead of someone else's. If you feel like playing with others at any point the matchmaking system is excellent and it even has a system in which if you need help or another agent needs help you can actually send a call for backup that will notify players nearby to jump in for help if they want to help you.
---
Ok well no one asked you and it‚Äôs not for PVE players, Crucible barely gets any content at all and this is for us. Why even get on here and just spout hate at things
---
Nice! I got this on my second run. Rolled with outlaw and Rampage. It's an awesome gun! Enjoy. 
---
i assume its some kind of bug, they should fix it probably monday, I tried contacting them via e-mail and over the phone got shut down by "contact us monday-friday 09:00-19:00 .... 
---
I‚Äôd rather have that, than being aimlocked machine gunned to death WHILE INVISIBLE. xD
---
"Well it‚Äôs not a copy, it‚Äôs the real thing but it‚Äôs the version when Andal wore it.
---
Like you know ? Your dead friend."
---
That‚Äôs beautiful 
---
Don't put Division 2 in the same box as Anthem
---
I got my first Chattering Bone on my 11th Last Wish! 
---
If you haven't painted yet, a bit of modelling putty in the cracks would made it look a lot better.  Just fill the cracks between parts with putty, then sand down to make a smooth surface.  Paint after that, for a nice smooth crack-free look. 
---
And I was just saying both comparisons are pretty dumb. Both games are good and attract different audiences. The division 2 doesnt touch the fantasy setting the destiny does. And people that enjoy tactical shooters would probably like the division more. It's a stupid comparison.
---
I love Moes
---
It gives you a bunch of cosmetics, instant access to 3 new specializations as they release and 7 day early access to the new episodes
---
Agreed. And it's sad too. I like the game but i wont risk playing it.
---
Almost like a sense of pride and accomplishment.
---
i wish i could just snap my fingers and make all the Cabal go away (except for papa Calus)
---
No, you may not. 
---
[bruh](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/azos7r/_/eiaccn2)
---
I get 2 chattering bones every run... I hate RNG
---
Just put ‚Äúfemale host‚Äù 
---
Well fuck me backwards through hedge. 
---
The fuck this comment is five days old, get a life 
---
You do understand like every game is a ‚Äúregurgitated copy of blah blah blah genre‚Äù right? Games progress because of games in jts genre. Look at apex and how its pinging system changed multiple games. Its normal. 
---
Its like saying ‚Äúfuck this road its the same material the other roads are made out of‚Äù well no shit, its because it works. 
---
The game is great, worth $60, and is a full game at release, has FREE dlc coming through already. 
---
Ill take more TD2‚Äôs over these ‚Äúlive services‚Äù publishers try selling us for $60 with content worth $5
---
Doing weekly bounties can take a little while but the easiest way is just those scrapper bounties. By far the quickest way
---
the spring event will bring a primary so maybe then
---
looking through your reddit history, I'd say you are the one is due to go outside. get off reddit and talk to someone in person freak.
---
It's sad how this community is never happy. It's always "nerf this" or "change that". The enhancement core system is fine the way it is. Fucking save them up. Next you'll want glimmer to be removed because you "shouldn't have to save a currency for anything"...
---
Lucky i didn‚Äôt even get a good roll lol üòÇ 
---
Awesome. Thanks. I'm going to check right now. 
---
More hate, nice
---
I feel your pain mine got a bad roll lol 
---
Trolls be like:
---
But it does not tell that the strike will be over once the boss is dead but before you kill the knights, which are **necessary step** in this specific version of strike. 
---
I will thx and i got a bad roll so might have to grind again lol
---
How is it with the fabled rank? I am currently fabled 2 in crucible and triumph says that I haven't completed that step, does it have to be comp? 
---
Pre nerf pocket infinity tbh
---
Yes, I think the reason the third group is unhappy is that they do not want to have to go out of  their way to do scrapper bounties if they'd rather do things like raids or reckoning. 
---
That gun was nasty...with special ammo pretty much available throughout the entire game this gun was a monster
---
Probably. But destiny scratches that fantasy itch for me
---
I'd bring a glass and some cookies ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I love it alone for the story mode. There is a great call for help mode if you get stuck on a mission. So far I've only used that once, but I will often answer the call if I'm about to level up, to push me that last bit.
---
I always thought the shriekers In d1 were more interesting with that death mechanic 
---
Or Lost Sectors.
---
Ok thank you.  
---
Wonderful idea, poor execution bud. 
---
Sorry Shaxx, hope you can forgive me one day but Vuvuzela has got to go. 
---
Anthem is the girl who needs to lie back down, division 2 should be labelled with destiny 2
---
No one said anything about karma? Youre so off topic from your original post at this point its just weird now. 
---
\*Shaxx crashes through the ceiling\*
---
Also one of the best soundtracks in the whole expansion
---
Yeah i was talking about delirium
---
i‚Äôve never been to fabled in glory beforeüòî
---
I'm making a point that you spend too much time on reddit. look at your initial comment dumbass
---
Monte Carlo was my PVP rifle. That thing just went into the enemy guardians head like a magnet, then strafe kill,continue  -&gt;
---
Oh the memories not to play shotguns all the time...
---
Ju beat
---
I feel your pain: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxjPM88qKEU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxjPM88qKEU) happened to me recently.
---
Fantastic story but not really interested in what youre selling bud. 
---
Nerd Darksouls 2 was the og D2
---
Your clothes analagy has to be one of the worst, and incomparable thing, to the enhancement core scarcity I've ever read. 
---
This happened to me, my nighthawk hit a lot harder than I thought it would. 
---
My prediction is 90% true, it could.be an exotics as well
---
What platform are you on?
---
At least the modifiers are better today, finally got a couple of diligent bounties done.
---
I'm sure of it. Reddit doesn't treat you like the ugly little freak you are. The real world is way more cruel.
---
700, however there will be new consumables that will boost your light for 30 minutes to help you keep up
---
700 right now.
---
Yeah did not expect that...
---
total lie. Division2 doesn't have half of the content Destiny 2 had at launch. 
---
You do lose points even if you quit in competitive tho.
---
You got to get 20 before times runs out. The more balls you throw in the more time you get. 
---
Is there something in the lore about Le Monarque being lucky? Or just saying it's a good weapon lol
---
Oh damn, that's cool.
---
Feels good lol, so ready to use this smg 
---
I'm actually pretty bummed I missed it. I heard about it after it was over, so I didn't get a chance to try it. So at this point I have to rely on other people explaining it and watching gameplay, which helps a lot, but it's not the same as actually playing.
---
Is this a cerberus+1 ornament?
---
I haven't read the lore but it seems to be powerful enough to help. 
---
That's strange I haven't lost any points when leaving the match 
---
Honestly look at his comment history. He's basically his own echo chamber
---
Sorry if my opinion is different from yours. Must make me instantly wrong by default. Won't happen again.
---
Power grind
---
I get that. And it does make sense. Upgrading your weapons and gear should still cost something other than planetary resources and gunsmith materials though. And adding another form of "currency" would just jumble things up more.
---
Any tips on what's the fastest way? Should I also focus on unlocking the new supers ? If so, how do I start that, I'm guessing it's a quest?
---
Also in fairness we are talking about two totally different games. Ones a fast paced FPS and the other is a tactical cover based TPS. It's like comparing Halo to Gears. Both great in their respective genres, both scifi shooters, but both totally different.
---
Sounds like you suck, gg ez noob
---
Thats typical shaxx shenigans, when shaxx sneaks in is when you know youre fucked

I‚Äôve heard really good things about The Division 2. 
---
Anthem, has unfortunately been a bit of a let down. I was sticking with it until just last week when the culmination of its issue became just a bit too much. It become more frustrating/boring than fun to play.
---
Sounds like you aren't getting matchmade. Pretty tough to do solo, especially if you aren't on the upper end of the light requirement.
---
LOL YOURE GARBAGE KID
---
dude its a boss and you could pretty easily cheese it if it could not attack through walls like it can. also I find the fact that they can teleport more annoying that the ground slam attack. just watch where they are any they wont catch you off guard 
---
I can see from your history that you're not interested in civil discussion
---
LFG for a fireteam to get the exotic sniper rifle Whisper of the Worm, a mission quest you can grab from Drifter in the Tower. You‚Äôll probably want to play both of the quests available from Ana Bray on Mars. They will yield the exotic Polaris Lance scout rifle and the exotic Sleeper Simulant Linear Fusion Rifle. Most NIghtfalls, Raids or even Black Armory content will be easier with acquiring these weapons.
---
After that, play the Forsaken campaign. Your boost skipped the Mercury and Mars campaigns so if you want to experience that you will need to grind up on another character instead of using the boost. You are in a power level grind to 700 now and just make sure to complete all your weekly and daily powerful challenges (what you used to know as Milestones). A 100k Nightfall score run won‚Äôt be obtainable for you until you get very high in the power level as you need to apply a power level adjustment higher than 100 to start getting your score multipliers to give score. (If you don‚Äôt have a Nightfall mod card, you will need to visit Xur. He is in Winding Cove this week)
---
SAAAAAME
---
Happy birthday...snitch.
---
Get time by killing the glowing enemies that drop the balls, I'm pretty sure. 
---
Gho to the drifter and see if he has a 3rd page,  that's where mine was. 
---
I always saw it go up after you hit the forge with the charges

This is me on my fourth win streak üòÇüíÄ

Your submission has been removed due to showing off weapons/loot that you got. Please keep post these on our end of the week Loot Threads, thank you!

---
Most importantly, the core gameplay. I love the cover system and the unique-feelings weapons, as well as tweaking and optimizing builds. I enjoy having to consider my moves and tactics, including the use of fun gadgets. I can be support, I can be a sniper, I can be the front line of an assault, etc. etc. It‚Äôs just...fun. There isn‚Äôt a whole lot I actively dislike about it.
---
I did ask you first, though.
---
My core farm has always been scrapper bounties and buying planet mats from spider then dumping them on packages when they hit over a 1000. No need to waste time farming ghost frags and waiting around for 45mins for a dude that takes 5 seconds to kill. I've got enough masterwork weapons to fill all 3 characters inventory, with multiple armor builds for each character. The current system was fine if you just wore what ever trash you were given untill you hit max light.
---
Not like this......not like this
---
It‚Äôs not hard. It‚Äôs tedious. And it can be bad. I got a 672 chest from one powerful engram. Another powerful engram dropped another chest piece at 674. Still only got me 1 light level versus the 672 piece.
---
I kinda wish they went a ghost recon future soldier route and make the game a little more sci if, add some new guns so it‚Äôs not ak47s and m16s and throw some robots in and it could be amazing honestly 
---
‚ÄúPeople aren‚Äôt as angry as me about this one issue, the community must be dumb!‚Äù
---
I know that they got a massive amount of money from a company from China to work on a new IP, but if the live team could focus on a single game that would be amazing
---
I know I was hoping it was a rework they secretly slipped in the reckoning loot pool.
---
Almost lasts as long as spectral blades!
---
No I totally get that.  But if that's the case it isn't really fair to compare these two similar but very different games is all I was saying.  It's like comparing apples to anthem lol.
---
