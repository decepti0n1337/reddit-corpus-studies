I don't know if I'd compare Warframe to MHW, as I enjoy Monster Hunter but find Warframe boring as all get out, but they both have a steep learning curve that can be off-putting. I personally don't like the feel of movement and gunplay in Warframe, so I got bored and stopped playing.

No it‚Äôs Tuton the Titan 
---
To be fair, we don‚Äôt know if it will work the same way as it did in D1.

He's a new NPC and he's called The Shadow.

No it was amazing in house of wolves which was year one

That‚Äôs an OSHA violation

I'll give it the benefit of the doubt until then but I'm sure it's perk will remain the same. 
---
Yeah I‚Äôm pretty sure you can, don‚Äôt quote me on that though 
---
Might be from Destiny 1
---
Can't wait to get this gun then immediately delete it from my inventory.

Forever against Thorn and its cancerous users. I will find you in the crucible, and i will end you.

Three eyed mask. Basically OEM steroids. Gives overshield,power ammo and full super energy on kills.

Like I said unpopular opinion I‚Äôve always gone with what works easier for me and my 2 go to in my kinectic slot outside ace of spades are bygones and tigerspite

I doubt it works the same, go look at the footage when he kills the enemy leaves a glowing orb in the air.

Says titan here, but also that he existed kinda before class titles were a thing, so who knows? Bungie and their retcons. 
---
somebody posted in here that, in fact, EVERY rug in the tower is creased/folded.
---
One is listed for everyone, who knows which one.
---
from 5000 seeds I generally end up with 10-20 cores. don't forget to turn in your gunsmith parts for more weapons. 
---
you should also get 80%+ return on shards
---
Nice

well you dont have the badge from collections either, which is the toughest part cuz fuck rng.

Same

Honestly, I hated the ornaments.

r/enlightenedcentrism but for videogames?

Im mostly kidding
---
Nice 
---
This Week post
---
Damaged reduced by 80% but most of that moved to increase base damage by 60-65%
---
Dat rug??  how about dat bow? gonna put somebodies eye out with that.
---
The people saying this stopped playing it, so that means everyone else did as well.
---
If you watch the trailer, i believe it's just a hunter character (our guardian) who just has the thorn
---
Imagine not caring about false information being spread simply because it aligns with your views. 
---
I'll try to keep this spoiler free
---
You have to get an item called "Seed of light" to unlock the third skill tree in each class. The first one you get thru a quest with Ikora when starting the Forsaken DLC. The second and third are random drops. You can get one from doing tier 2 or higher of the Blind Well in the Dreaming City, and one from the first encounter in the Last Wish raid. You use to get one from completing the Weekly blind well bounty that you get in the Dreaming City on the Full Curse week, but I don't know if that's a thing anymore since some story stuff happened since then.
---
Why you hating on heroic story missions? You should be hating adventures
---
Wait, the second one? With Thandy Newton and that ridiculous car/motorcycle chase? That is the worst one, by far. You must be mistaken.
---
Incels unite!
---
It on Bungie yt not destiny 
---
We all did
---
you get one of your choice during the forsaken story
---
the second comes from doign blind well (Endgame activity)
---
the third comes from the raid, or turning in the reward from the blind well on the "max curse" week (we are on the 1st week, max curse is on the 3rd week)
---
Well, the big draw for the dreaming city is the Blind Well. Which can drop any number of legendary or exotic stuff. Plus that‚Äôs how you unlock the third tier on your second subclass. Petra actually has more story missions when you talk to her. There is also a raid. Several lost sectors and other random events. That‚Äôs just the stuff I‚Äôve come across exploring. I haven‚Äôt looked up online anywhere what all is actually in the dreaming city. 
---
"I don't play it so it's a dead game"
---
‚Äúmaybe if i lick elon‚Äôs boot more he won‚Äôt call me a pedophile!‚Äù
---
Hurry up and sue!!!
---
Dreaming city has quests, ascendant challenge, blind well, ascendant chests, shattered throne (every 3 weeks), the cats, bones, eggs, and the Last Wish raid. 
---
There are also exotic quests  and pinnacle weapons. 
---
Nerd lol
---
There's a lot of secrets in DC. You can hunt those, do Gambit, or grind Luna's, grind titles
---
Do raids and shattered throne wen is available. And last but less important grind another class.
---
There's a lot to do...
---
Why is nobody talking about the fact that the Drifter is Dredgen Yor? Or did we already know that? I haven't kept up with the lore.
---
In the Deep, physics works differently ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
thats actually badass as fuck
---
I mean, do you really want us to answer that question, Bungo?
---
Good calculus joke you got there
---
He stocked up on his favorite shaders so his levelling sets will still be color coordinated
---
And divisions wasn't.
---
I was comparing both a sequel and a new IP to anthem, broadening the comparisons, showing just how poorly anthem did.
---
Anthem also came out long after both of these had launched. It should have seen what happened and learned. 
---
That‚Äôs literally all comp is, I prefer a team of gwinsin spectral blades over that.
---
According to the destiny wiki, he is classified as a hunter 
---
Can confirm...
---
Wait I'm confused. The emissary called the drifter Dredgen and he said he doesn't go by that name anymore. Is he Dredgen? 
---
Your just as much of a nerd for understanding it
---
I've been maxed out on prismatic facets and unable to use them the past 4 weeks because I got everything from bright engrams. As long as nothing that influences gameplay (for example, a ghost shell with amazing perks not found on any non-silver ghost shell) is put in silver-only packages, I am fine with this. 
---
Ah
---
Me too less than a week brother
---
It was complete trash until it got buffed during the dark below. It was trash for 3 months not a whole year.
---
I realized that it wasn't exactly the original but tbh he was good enough that it won't bother anyone who aren't actively listening for differences, he got better towards the end with the stashes mission
---
At least d1 had more strikes, different planets, one raid and most importantly pvp. It was also a lot more polished. Anthem is extremely buggy and way more monotonous than vanilla D1.
---
They most common thing between them would be a terrible loot system and even that is debatable.
---
Zavala and troupe did nothing when Cayde died, so I'm going to rally behind the drifter
---
Wasn't drifter confirmed to be a hunter though? And dredgen yor was confirmed to be a titan. Dredgen is a title, not a name (ex. Dredgen Ikora)
---
When you complete the deal you are Aldo given the title "Dredgen" 
---
I like the year 1 hunter mask to be honest. 
---
Me too
---
Also cus i love gambit
---
I'm in the same boat my social awkwardness and anxiety prevent me from being able to form a group and my work schedule makes it so I can basically only be on around 3am. I love the game I just wish there was a more solo aspect. Like a solo raid yea it would be hard but make it fun and go e rewards just not the ones you would get from a regular raid
---
Have the drifter run through that shit and have his ice ball take over 
---
You can use Rat King, Prospector, or Thunderlord to cheese Riven if you stack enough buffs and a debuff, and everyone is at the appropriate power level. With the grenade launcher changes, if Prospector gets adjusted it might become *the* weapon of choice. 
---
yes
---
Small and often my guys
---
ANGERY
---
Bro SAME! I‚Äôve honestly stopped playing the game because being a solo player just doing the same things over and over and being hated when I join a team of two players just got tiring
---
What the he is post-birth abortion? Isn't abortion done before birth? What even? 
---
Oh lol I thought you were talking about Destiny yeah I kinda stopped following Ninjago when I left for college but yeah I was into it ever since it came out
---
Is Gambit Music and Gambit Video thrown in too? Can I buy a device that allows me to talk to the drifter and he controls my home?
---
What do you expect? Them to keep making content for free? it's an expensive process, and quite frankly. If you really want all the extras save up and purchase the annual pass, like I'm sure you did Destiny.
---
Reaper gang
---
Goto Spider and check his wanted list.  You do not need to get the quest, just check the wanted list sectors listed.
---
Might wanna check with r/sharditkeepit next time
---
Well I'll never have 1k voices now 
---
He clearly is, he get super scared of the last word. Dredgen is just a title really. 
---
What program do you use to get your programs organized like that?
---
\*sigh\* if only the thorn would keep its weapon type in season of the drifter because imagine it... having both the thorn and the rose equipped at once(and if you get a kill with the thorn the rose will have its poison effect for 5 seconds vice versa) i really want the 2 weapons to match but eh at least we get malfeasance
---
Like Dredgen is just a other title for those who follow in the footsteps of The original Dredgen Yor
---
In response:
---
1) as you said, even though it's understood that Yor was killed by Shin Malphur, but as suggested there might be a chance he's still alive.
---
2) The timeline? It might've been a bait-and-switch for Yor to assume the identity of The Drifter to get Shin Malphur off his tracks if he ever found out he was still alive, and Bungie might retconn the idea into existing Lore. As far as I'm concerned, there's no real "official" timeline we know of that Bungie can't change up.
---
3) Agree with you there, although it's possible having spent time away after his "defeat" at Shin Malphur's hands that he may have changed, what with his dabbling into the Darkness.
---
4) This is the most plausible explanation for the Emissary calling the Drifter "Dredgen". It crossed my mind, having read and listened to the Lore about Shin and Dredgen.
---
This post is more of a "What-If" than actual fact, 'coz we've not seen the actual cutscene where Drifter and the Emissary meets. Guess we'll know in the coming weeks. No harm in discussion though.
---
Trostland is best land. I get all my catalysts leveled up there fighting the cabal and fallen. It always puts a smile on my face because right at the end they throw so much at you that you really have to keep on your toes and it keeps it exciting.

Double tap jump quickly. Best piece of advice for warlock jump ever. Rarely have issues now.

Look out for sales though, buying Forsaken + annual pass was really worth it for me, so much more content than the base game

You remember the name? I had a similar game the other day, was playing as Titan on PC..
---
Click the link you put in, it 404s. [Cosmo's tweet] (https://twitter.com/Cozmo23/status/1101235898799218688) showed that 'the stranger' was a typo and the name is 'the shadow' when you check the file again.
---
I got a god roll (for me personally) Tigerspite and it really helped me power through the auto rifle kills, look for ones with kill clip and outlaw and it's just gonna be a breeze clearing ads
---
Chonkyboi
---
Amen. I've been playing since the D1 beta, and while D1 had a *very* rocky launch, it was still had legs. The campaign, also known as everyone's first impression of the game, was nonsensical and anticlimactic. But endgame and pvp were there. Hell, VoG is still many people's favorite raid. 
---
/mini rant from a D1 apologist
---
That machine gun looks baller though. 
---
Actually read the notes next time
---
It's not my fault you have an easily shootable face!
---
AROOO TO THAT BROTHER
---
Good point. The game is deep enough that, for me, I'm just getting all the rolls of the armor and mods and everything kinda figured out. Just got my titan to 650 though. Excited to be grinding at the top of the game vs always being a lower light lvl than everyone
---
Only found out a month ago.

I do that max hc, blackout, extinguish, match game and go for 400k+ my highest is 447k

---
I can't wait to 2 tap a NF with Thorn.
---
The only similarities between D2 and WF are the scifi environments. WF focuses more on movement and ability usage, with weapons usually being secondary. D2 is the other way around, gunplay is different, movement and abilities are quite different.
---
I wonder if this is Uldren Sov, and if so, he's probably the most OP hunter to ever live. RIP.
---
Yes, yes you are bungie :-P
---
It‚Äôs an honor to be in your presence sir.
---
Yes. Yes you are.
---
You can cheese with edge transit
---
Whoaaa is that chroma 
---
Are you talking about glimmer? 
---
Every loat sector boss is Wanted. Best to farm is the one at Mars as its short and quick travel point is very close to it. Run in, kill boss, quick travel out, repeat.
---
Train scene was from the first, but the second one has where he goes into the base, before the stupid motorcycle chase scene an starts killing everyone
---
Glimmer is money in Destiny.
---
You don't need macros for this, and apparently it was discovered on console.
---
It just has a lower spawn rate during non max curse weeks, but can still be encountered. 
---
Ok, here we go. My thought on this is, Uldern never gets to be the Vanguard, or getting the Ace of Spades. During the Ace in the hole mission, Cayde said that any Hunter that killed him gets the position but Uldren isn't qualified because he isn't a guardian. Now what? well, traditionally Vanguard are voted. So, we might have to vote for the new vanguard. 
---
- The Ace of Spades where meant to be for us (guardian) only. It was said by Banshee himself and Cayde wanted us to take care of the gun. Now during the cut scene, I didn't hear a sound of the Ace at all, there's only one bullet that was fired which is Petra's. (The Ace might not function properly so the gun won't fire or our guardian didn't pulled the trigger)
---
I can't even preview another class' gear and this mofo goes and at minimum dresses up as a different class? 
---
That's illegal. Thank you Shin.
---
Hey man, I'm a disabled solo player with a host of side issues. There's a lot this has to offer thanks to its match making. If you need to talk to a Dr about general anxiety like I did to get on a non addictive rx like buspirone, go for it (ya I just opened up on my perdonal medical history, gtfy). It helps a lot bro. If not, hit me up I'm Illidanas#11489 on bnet if you play pc. I judge not my friend. I play in the evenings/night. 
---
Gz.
---
I need frigid jackal... I'm trying to get it from nodes... Anything else works? 
---
Why was D1 armor so much sexier?! Give us those sets and ornaments plzzzz
---
Makes sense. Im wanting it for colkections reasons
---
Yep same, not the biggest PVP player but it‚Äôs fun to use
---
No.
---
Depends what class you are for super, wl = chaos reach , hunter = bb or arcstrider titan - ss or sunbreaker. For weapons any high damaging heavy‚Äôs try and use on primary in your primary slot. Try and use a gl or sg in special slot.
---
If anything could tank a nova bomb that would render the super basically useless since it'd become a flashy grenade at that point, most of the time panic nova bomb is your only chance against a Titan chucking hammers or the like 
---
Congrats dude that is a lot harder imo than calus three man you have an achievement not many people have don't let anybody shit on it 
---
I agree with OP, I don't understand why they'd want to change but I guess they need a way for more income maybe?
---
go big or go home
---
#***FOR REAL??***
---
Cause you can't skate on console.  They nerfed the momentum you gain.  Skating in D2 on console doesn't exist.  Skating on pc is how it used to be in D1.  So there won't be skating.  They say there will be.  But it's not skating if there's no speed.
---
So its pve content to get gear to keep playing gambit?  Armor looks pretty cool but im not a fan of gambit, thanks though.

Go to the EDZ lost sector that's on the left, it's the easiest to farm, you can do 15 clears in less than 30 minutes
---
There are no penalty from leaving 
---
Just this, likely towards halfway into the season you Will Most likely own pretty much all of the cosmetics Because of all the engrams you get for just playing. I‚Äôd rather have bundles that can give you special stuff every week that you can pay for that can help them build up an income now that Activision is gone.
---
No we don't. 
---
Planet-based Power Cap is so hardcore that you die in 5 hits at 650 PL on the EDZ.
---
Protec the crow boi!

No, I do that on the regular, except in different areas and never come back up.

Hey Drifter, where is the invader?

Grinding gambit, by doing specific tasks in the mode. From getting malfeasance to putting 15 notes in at the same time for all four players. It‚Äôs a grind is the best way to describe.
---
I thought wow that's impressive.. then he stops on the god damn bar! WOW

This "gambling"-stuff is about real money and unknown rewards. The matrix was to my knowledge only for prismatic facets, whick could only be gained by completing a bounty. On top of that, the whole loot pool was displayed right where you used the facet and quite small without the possibility of duplicates.
---
Cool clickbait headline on shady site, guy.
---
Here's a real hot take: Eververse is fine and "The Players Of Destiny 2" don't care. Literally nobody is complaining, even on DTG. We'll be able to purchase cosmetics directly and the money is now going directly to Bungie.
---
Apparently he‚Äôs a new character named ‚ÄúThe Shadow‚Äù
---
Literally watched this last week and realised the meme was from this scene for the first time. Classic! 
---
"Not even close, baybee" - Dunkey
---
Yeah. I‚Äôm okay with this change. I‚Äôve gotten a ton of Eververse stuff just from the engrams where I‚Äôm at the point where I don‚Äôt even use Matrix anymore. 
---
Was about to type exactly that. OP's account is new and this clickbait article is the only thing they've posted, wouldn't surprise me if they wrote the article itself.
---
Eververse is totally fine, nobody is complaining about it even here on reddit.
---
Ok thanks for the info
---
Same, I hate the fact that solo players get shafted in this game. But it only makes it all the more achievement to do things solo.
---
Getting luna in a 4 stack isn't an achievement at all, but getting it solo? You get something to be proud of.
---
Yeah it is a good/fun weapon but i just cant get myself to use a single weapon for so long. Still congratz tho on the high killcount
---
Ya not even halfway there. 
---
Now would be a good to try for part of it as it‚Äôs triple infamy week so getting the ghost after three resets will be easy. But besides that I don‚Äôt know 
---
I got it on my 10th run. If you don't want to keep doing it, wait till Benedict sells it. If you have the patience, you just have to finish one more completion.
---
I would love to play but there's an issue I'm kinda grounded so rip me 
---
Big oof
---
Thanks!!
---
Yeahhhhhhh üò≠üò≠
---
Remember to check Benedict every week and save some tokens, Midnight Coup is in his rotation and he should sell it at some point!
---
Bc they want cash. 
---
My point exactly
---
There was no money involved, right?  So no problem.
---
And if there was money involved, just remove the ability to buy prismatic matrices.
---
Wish Five, i believe. Teleport to Morgeth
---
I was under the impression it was joxer since the dialog released between him and the drifter seems to match the scene. 
---
I actually like the Titan for once, wondering what kinda shaders I could stick on that set
---
Its not the strike. There should be a mission right next to the strike on the map with the same name
---
But you can see the potential items you can get with the matrix, and they are on a knockout list.  There are many games where you are spending money on loot boxes and you have no idea what you are getting and there is no knockout feature.
---
But man... it's 2019 and this is what we are discussing?  How did we lets games come to this?  Paying money for cosmetics?  predatory In-game gambling?
---
Plus that reload masterwork helps you keep the rampage going even longer
---
HECK what is this witchery
---
100%
---
I've destroyed players with Jotunn, and I've had players that I can't even hit with Jotunn. I've been demolished by OEM users, and I've beaten OEM users. All gear does is make a good players better, or like in my case, a terrible player not quite as bad.

---
I'll be on this evening (about 8-9 hours from now) and can help you knock it out if you haven't finished by then.
---
Gamertag is the same as my username.
---
Is that what‚Äôs shredding the primevals?
---
Most likely yes. Until bungie allows cross platform play or something similar anytime you switch you will always have to go through the campaign or pay to not do it
---
You can use a booster to go to 30 and that skips through all year 1 content I think. The first one is free but the others need to be purchased. 
---
May be worth doing on first character, but then on my alternates I just played through it all. Horror story and thunderlord aren't level locked. So with those at max power, it made the story missions a cake walk. Plus you get 2 exotics along the way. 
---
Oh that didnt work out
---
Wut did he do to make the the purple explodies 
---
Hopefully you don't get stuck with the instant supers! Cause god did those suck.
---
Yes. Moving on.

This is my clan in a nutshell. Just D2 and UNO

If they want to remove the gambling aspects in their games, they have a ***lot*** of work to do.

I don't need to be there to know. But man you are really lose here, you don't know what I'm talking about. I'm talking about invasion, oil agenda, war crimes etc. There are several proofs about this things, most of them from journalist and former military people. So I'm not keeping this conversation anymore because you think I'm attacking him personally, and I'm not, what I originally post was that we could discuss what service the USA army does for us.
---
 I'm not loosing more time with you because you are really out of the point here. Excuse me if you get offended by me. See ya.
---
Look at that garbage handling. I would just shard it.
---
Well basically 
---
Whoaaa that projectile is a good catch. I‚Äôm actually inclined to believe it is a unique wepon like Jotunn
---
Well that was this character's name before it got changed to The Shadow.
---
I've seen it twice in about 50 matches (some had 3 rounds), so, guess I'm just unlucky
---
Let me guess, you don't like him because you were told not to like him because he doesn't swallow the blue pill anymore?
---
No limit, but you'll never want to do a forge again once u complete 100. Ps I'm not sure if ur talking about a stack limit or daily amount. There is a cap 15 or 14 can't remember but less than 20 but no limit to how many u can get per day.
---
Honestly would be better if all the cards where Exodia's Leg only :D 
---
It was so satisfying to watch that fight
---
At least they are good at something for once lol
---
i had not thought about it. But thinking about it now, i guess it's just my preference. Also a way for me to ensure that i can cancel the super. don't want to accidentally use and lose my super in the middle
---
That's true. And I fear making them "better" would result in altering the playstyle unique to them so having a niche where they are effective would create a demand ,no?
---
Fuck you
---
Did they let you win?
---
oh
---
I‚Äôm referring to Mesa Sean still calling him the stranger, even after bungie changed the file name. 
---
Thought the name was a Star Wars prequel meme reference
---
All the classes are strong, just need to put the work in. Sure some are easier than others but like any PvP just need to learn what they are likely to do and counter it as best you can
---
That old statement again. Should we not criticize bad movies too? Since only 0.001% of us are actual directors and producers
---
nah chief i need to re download the whole ass game
---
The titan armor reminds me of halo armor
---
thats correct
---
Oh did you guys correct him? 
---
as a hunter main myself, i was excited for this because my hunter was getting jealous of my warlock and titan getting 2 chests per week while he was getting 1 üòÇ
---
i like that name
---
Thats the weird part, I had 13 so I shouldve been able to get 2 more but I didnt and my postmaster didnt have anything either, he was completely empty
---
Nice argument. You can't offend  anyone with that. 
---
Since when is bygones/trust sweaty?
---
Very well done!  
---
Is this a portrait of your own Guardian? Or one of Dredgen Yor, maybe?
---
I know what you mean Im on 80 rn and plan to finish them before reset and its a PAIN. But ko, I had 2 free spaces for Modulars (its 15) but neither I or my postmaster got any
---
Don't forget tractor cannon.
---
Hunters are always crying, meanwhile they have all the cheesiest shit a character can have LUL
---
If you get the right rolls it is really sweaty. The correct trust is the next best thing after luna's howl and will flinch you like a bitch. Plus a kill clip bygones can kill with 2 full bursts to the head.
---
What did I just watch
---
Aren't heavy ammo finder still bugged? Because the last time i tried i got even less with additional heavy finders.
---
I've watched this a hundred times and still cry laughing.

---
How to you get this weapon ? 
---
Why does everyone talk as if shotguns are exclusive to Titans lol
---
Right? I couldn't use the matrix at all the last few weeks
---
You mean prodigial/scatterhorn armor pieces? 
---
I didn't even have to zoom in to know exactly what those 5 cards were
---
What 4 major buffs are you talking about?
---
This was not even remotely the same thing. At all. The loot box issue was the exact OPPOSITE of the Prismatic Matrix. Have you played the game?
---
do the raid with both characters and there you go no jealousy :D
---
Aaaaand he sells garbage again. Fing A, Bungo. Can we please have some real Exotica from him? Not that repetitive shit again. Like seriously Aeon Souls again?
---
You don't need to skate. You run Transverse/Stompees to get the higher sprint speed, stack with a Lightweight Shotgun, use slides and cover. 
---
But ^that ^^ruins ^^^narratives ^^^^and ^^^^^pisses ^^^^^^prople ^^^^^^^ off.
---
Yes, it's fun to play solo. But if you want to play exclusively by yourself, good luck avoiding random teammates at public events (which you most likely will do for the gear)
---
I play solo pretty much all the time. You cant do raids which is a huge bummer. You have access to a majority of the content but the problem is that most of the activities are team oriented so you will always be at a disadvantage.
---
Congrats, hope I never face you

---
it's not going to replace Sleeper in cases where you'd "need" it, but it's a fun as hell weapon. If you're not short on shards, there's no reason not to pick it up.
---
Time to go to a chiropractor :]
---
I think it's just or player charter tbh. You can get all that great right now. 
---
Hey OP, just a suggestion, but you might consider putting "Xur" in the post without the accent mark so it's easier for people to find when searching.
---
Thank you as always for throwing these up for everyone!
---
It does, but it also says from September 2018 - August 2019, so I have no idea tbh
---
Nowhere near as fast but that pisses titan mains off
---
I don't mind gambit. Solo queueing was the worst though. Recently started playing in a 4 stack and I can tell you it's so much more fun.
---
I saved up bounties for a month and then this week I went in and popped them all, went from 6K to 15K instantly. It was dope.
---
But why? This some quality stuff.
---
Oh, I don't debate that warlocks are still viable. I play top dawnblade all the time and it's still just as good as it was (the buffs it received were 100% irrelevant), and most of stormcaller still has great neutral game.
---
I also didn't call the Spectral and OEM nerfs tiny, just pointed out that they were balanced so that players didn't feel bad while Nova Warp got effectively deleted from both PvE and PvP.
---
Explain how it was the opposite please. 
---
It affects it because they will no longer be full health after a gunfight. Now they are still recovering and don‚Äôt instantly get full health. You can no longer keep on killing, because your health no longer refills every time you do. Also, it doesn‚Äôt even function while in a super anymore, which is pretty significant.
---
Is there a wish 15 that we somehow still haven‚Äôt found?
---
Darn, someone else made this joke before me!
---
I did the same thing. It was glorious.
---
Yeah, they were. We still only got a chance of getting what we wanted, but it was free once a week as you say. For what it's worth, I much prefer the facets to the bright engrams
---
You‚Äôve activated my trap card Drifter!
---
AH, Exodia - no one‚Äôs ever been able to summon him!
---
I will get you a screen shot when I get home
---
How the hell did he lose
---
Of course my guy 
---
I'm at 276 matches and still about 8000 infamy away. Ugh
---
Alright alright alright 
---
I'll always try to get good perks on Scatterhorn helmets on my titan! So sexy
---
You can gain repeated weapons actually. Did this on my 3rd and I got a repeat.
---
This is way too good.
---
Nerf that SOB
---
Actually that's a good strategy. You won't have motes, so if he's wasting his shots on you when anyone on your team has motes, then that was a completely failed invasion.
---
Original image? Asking for a friend 
---
Thank you dude. I‚Äôm only missing the ship and ghost for cursebreaker. Truth to power on chronicler. Legend three times in different seasons for unbroken. And a few frames for Blacksmith. 
---
Lol, I know right.  These are dead bro and not even funny.
---
Man, just do some editing, at least put a white bar and the text, because the meme looks like shit
---
Bank some motes, yo.
---
You have issues 
---
Dude if you dont have the vinilla game the forsaken legendary collection comes with it. I believe base forsaken does too
---
The destiny 2 app helps with finding others to help play
---
Alright alright alright alright

Exotic weapon confirmed
---
That was some good shoot‚Äôn partner!
---
It is sold separately. [https://www.gamerevolution.com/guides/465915-destiny-2-annual-pass-not-available-xbox-one-how-to-buy-it-no-forsaken](https://www.gamerevolution.com/guides/465915-destiny-2-annual-pass-not-available-xbox-one-how-to-buy-it-no-forsaken)
---
The catalyst is easy to get! I can help you on either PS4 or Xbox.
---
Does it ever drop exotics? I did not receive a single exotic from prime engrams.
---
It is more of a niche exotic. It will NOT replace an accurate pulse rifle, but it is not meant to.  
---
Aiming down the sights reduces spread, somewhat.  
---
Try using that in conjunction with the Actium War Rig. Gives you a nice long stream of bullets for something like Gambit.  
---
I've also used it in Crucible for some close range kills and longer range suppression.
---
Oh yeah the midas and stuff...but I feel like they have given up...dont u want something like trials to test your own skills and have unique rewards...in a way it brought the community together 
---
Several times lately I've had teammates with literally 0 motes deposited.  I. Just. Don't. Get. It.
---
Dude! This is acrually awesome!
---
I was thinking bout keeping up dragons shadow for gunfights and stuff but you can do that too ig. Also!!! Top tree arcstrider if you have dynamo you can keep dodging near enemies kill em with your melee rinse and repeat. Real nice synergy 
---
Dreaming city
---
&gt; Tracking is cut in half
---
It's still 8 seconds. That's enough for titan to pop into cover, regen hp and still have the mark going. So you still can't ever push the fucker or you'll get oneshot with a shotty, sniper, or chappy middleground.
---
Holy shit that's amazing work!   
---
I‚Äôm just disappointed due to a misleading title. I expected to see a crazy good scoreboard and an even crazier enemy scoreboard, but instead got this and you admitting to ignoring mechanics and effectively throwing the game to benefit your friend. 
---
It‚Äôs like if you went to a restaurant that had ‚Äúbest chicken and waffles in the country!‚Äù, and when your order came out it was great value chicken nuggets on a still-cold eggo waffle and aunt jemimas pancake sauce. No so good.
---
If I could ask for a refund on this post, I would.
---
Oh I do, but on another hand trials really showed how broken the sandbox is and in a very aggravating way 
---
YES ü§£ü§£ this is amazing
---
XD you take this too seriously, but I'll try to be more concise next time.
---
I'm sorry we can't all be amazing like you, my liege.
---
I played to help my friends, not impress the people on reddit.
---
Someone please ps in a Black Lotus from M:TG
---
I didn't think it was necessary to point out that games go on sale sometimes. Games go on sale sometimes. That doesn't permanently change the baseline price of the game.
---
And the price of D2 will almost certainly go down. Right before the launch of D3, at the latest.
---
These facts don't mean that the price of a digital copy should mimic the price of a physical copy. Nor does it mean that if Bungie says Forsaken is included with the vanilla version of D2 for free, what they're actually saying is that the price of the vanilla version of D2 has been reduced by the price of the Forsaken expansion.
---
I love gambit, I just wish I knew how to make friends so we can communicate and dominate
---
The point is not that what you did is somehow bad. It‚Äôs that the post you made on reddit (the very place you went out of your way to post to the people you are trying not to impress btw) is inaccurate. 
---
probably just banked his motes
---
Black amoury was more of a test (no story and just to get feedback on what they should do so they can easily improve the next dlc) and not solid gameplay, if you look closely there was lots of lore behind it as well as other things. Im not saying it was amazing. (Tbh it wasnt the best dlc ever) but its part of a 3 season package along with season of the drifter looking sick as fuck.
---
How do you get pins? Do you order them?
---
Oh you think the knife is one hit kill? Have you ever used it? 
---
Reminds of a *cough* red death *cough* particular pulse rifle in d1 
---
I just can‚Äôt take anyone seriously who says the Whisper quest was bad, let alone the worst quest in the game lol
---
Love the gamer tag and username 
---
Yeah they mentioned it in a TWAB a little while back
---
Then play Halo.
---
I've noticed two things in gambit this week.  Either people don't bother picking up motes so I either have to over extend to get them before they disappear or people refuse to bank motes when we have enough to summon for much longer than they should be.
---
is that Trust, it looks great in gold.
---
Thanks. Favorite band from college. I've had this GT since Live launched
---
Yeah
---
Not loading on mobile and I thought everyone was being sarcastic 
---
The Darkness!
---
Doesn't matter which one is the strongest, when all of them are shotgun blasted in the face. 
---
[The road map chart on this page shows 2 exotic quests.](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/47648) One will be thorn, but we don't know what the other will be. We also don't know if any non-quest exotics are being added, since there were none shown in the video. 
---
That's against the rules, isn't it?
---
If they‚Äôre hiding behind a corner, just shuck a nade at them. They can choose to sit in the grenade and die because they no longer have full health and shield after a kill, or they can move around and reposition, taking up time towards  the now cut in half time. It‚Äôs still a long ass timer by any means, not denying that. 
---
Is this like izanagi light?
---
Dont fall for that, they are both thorn. Its telling you that you get with or without the pass 
---
*mobile phone*  -_-
---
No, that's not what that means. 
---
Holy Hannah banana! Do you not enfuse or masterwork ha ha. 
---
Triple
---
THIS IS IRON GIANT ERASURE
---
Nice, my warlock can be Dante from DMC now...isnt the titan armor just an old D1 armor?
---
If you activate your super while at the same time swapping your weapon it 1. Sends you really far really fast if done right, and 2. Makes you go 3rd person for like 3 seconds
---
Stomp-ee5 kind of over complicates triple jumps in the whisper run.. you can comfortably clear the jumping area with normal boots and triple jump..
---
Infuse*
---
Thx man
---
Yes you freaking well are a joke to me, and everyone else for that matter, instead of getting Geomags to finish up Forsaken, I get you 3 times in a row. If you wondered why your mother and I‚Äôs marriage is falling apart, just look in the mirror
---
Suffice to say, I REALLY hate WoSD

The only friend I have on mine is for killing Oryx in the story, the rest are randos from the 100.io.

Was that in the vidoc?

On mobile there is an option to copy text.

Awesome work. I wanna see one with Gwent. 
---
Considering gambit already is almost as sweaty as comp
---
This prime will make people die of dehydration from the sweat
---
Ok that's impressive but how did you got so much?
---
I mean i am not a casual but with all the DLC and my low luck with exotics,xur has provided me with so many good exotics (nighthawk,tractor cannon for instance)
---
Yes yes and yes
---
There should also be a chance it draws 5 cards to form Exodia
---
r/PrequelMemes is leaking
---
I‚Äôm sure we will go back and hammer out that stuff but it was just really bad in our eyes when it launched.  I‚Äôve heard a lot of good things about the guns though so looking forward to those.
