Found the Titan running Recluse and OEM
---
---
---
I feel bad man i got it on my second bounty, then again i have run five 920 ordeals in a row killing all the champions without getting atleast a prism :/ RNG in this game is broken
---
Yes I second that
---
Don't forget the strike that comes after, you have to complete it flawlessly (dying kicks you back into orbit) very, very fun to do solo.
---
Have you seen the two giant skulls that hang above Shaxx?
---
obviously skins/shaders whatever cost waaaay to much for bungie to develop by letting us have  something we like so we would not have to pay for something in eververse
---
Yeah, it rotates. Momentum was there for a couple of weeks.
---
damn I need a link for that considering I can’t find it on YouTube
---
Thank you. I’ll admit I’m kinda salty that warlocks have been pushed aside for so long but this seems like an easy fix they’ve been ignoring because everyone mains hunter or titan
---
Well now you cant play PvP anymore :D
---
çasusl
---
Nice.
---
Nothing is an easy fix for Bungie. After all, a nerf to One Eyed Mask took them a year and a half lol
---
u/couchweeb u/BiGGCaTT99 look in the top left corner
---
Ah yes *break the not*
---
makes me sad... but it is worth it
---
Freehold tank whether
---
Yes 100%, it’s a very good all-arounder
---
Don't know how to join
---
I doubt it was due to ability. It’s just super low priority.

---
Possibly, but I'll just keep grinding, as much as I want it the world won't end if I don't get it
---
I have an immediate disdain for anyone that uses wardcliff in pvp. I guess my anger comes from the weapon itself though. I will be ten miles away and one of the rockets hits my pinky toe and I explode into atoms. I use the weapon and fire it directly into a crowd of enemy players and it just takes off their shields and I die for some reason.
---
Ah, okay. I have that one also. Guess I got them confused.

WILL, SOMEONE PLEASE, GET THIS GUARDIAN, HIS CROWN?!
---
Yeah from shaxx
---
As a Semi-Casual gamer I've been OK with hte Content thus far. In fact I'm only level 53 so I still have a ton more to do IMO&gt;
---
Yeah I don't know about pvp but for pve that roll is amazing.
---
Yeah I do one my mates gave me an extra for some reason
---
Do you I have to do anything to like get the quest
---
It’s always worth a look to see if the event is going to start. When you transmat in and EP is running then go back and forth between the zones until you get into a lobby without it active.
---
Spectral blades is great in crucible with the new exotic helmet
---
Honestly you should get it just because the zero hour mission is really fun. But the gun itself is good, not a top tier endgame option, but good in general play.
---
u/LUDERSTN destiny memes er de bedste
---
Hell yea! Especially if u got a team using it with u, AND the catalyst (not required but it performs better, does more damage with the catalyst, and more nanites) then yes, it's great all around, cuz u can sit in the back and easily take out majors or bosses from a distance, but yea over all, 10/10, I got it when it first came out and it's always been on all 3 of my characters ever since, plus I mean if u got a team using it with u? Shit yall will be pumping out some big PP damage bro,
---
Same problem, gives me the "too many friends" error sometimes... and I have a grand total of like 5 friends on my list. crucible, vanguard strikes, and most planetary stuff is fine, but the moon dies anytime i go there
---
"THIS IS WHAT THEY CALL A RIGHTEOUS INFLICTION OF RETRIBUTION" by far my favorite line for Lord Shaxx
---
Destiny,  NFS Heat,  Stardew Valley,  lots of Netflix,  work,  and lots of time with my partner :)
---
Whether we wanted it or not
---
Lol makes sense
---
That’s reaching. But I mean I hope they do something spectacular cause this was cringe to say the least. 
---
No cut scene of guardians going through the portal. No graphical change of the gate in the tower. It doesn’t even look like it’s turned on... I feel like we should go plug it in. All this build up for some weak “ya ya we tested it a bunch. Yada yada yada...” When?! What?! Oooof.
---
Definitely!
---
Dude I got to applaud you
---
As a Titan main, I am forced to begrudgingly agree.
---
Sooo, that’s a yes XD
---
Hvy bow was just as easy. Boom...
---
So my main goal is really just to explore all the planets and do the patrols/adventures?
---
Hero of the Twilight Gap
---
Well all I can tell you is you can only get them on curse week as that’s the only time the oracle opens up and you can get to the queens throne room.
---
Ah you’re right. Forgot about that!
---
Still down right?
---
Theres another nice one on the final path to the sanctified mind, overlooking the plains; I posted a pic of it a while back
---
That’s why you melee afterwards every time.
---
www.bungie.com -&gt; login with your psn account (or whatever) search for clans, click join.
---
Ape.
---
You can do that, yes. The story missions are ok, they're a break from patrols, adventures ect, give you some context of what's going on or what's happened, and can be an ok way to level up your light level.
---
Later on when you are doing nightfall strikes, most of these are harder versions of story missions/strikes, so it doesn't hurt to have ran them in the story to get a sense of them.
---
But otherwise, there is no real need to finish the original 3 stories anymore.
---
I actually killed someone casting arc staff with 2x charges from fists of havoc+thunder coil
---
Correction. All Titan melee are supers.

Great work Guardian! However loot/roll/achievement posts are prohibited to prevent our subreddit from being cluttered (we get way too many!) - please keep these submissions in the weekly pinned loot/achievement thread. Thanks!

If you've got a question concerning if a roll you've got is good or not, try /r/ShardItKeepIt !

Is it a one shot? Because I might switch to it simply for the fact that most grenades don’t even seem to break an enemies shields
---
Dope, thanks for this. More helpful than you think &lt;3
---
The one he made
---
Noooooo......I DEMAND THE ANSWER, CREATURE!!!!!!
---
Can't relate, every single person said they wanted to kill themselves bc of my first time. Took 3-4 hours to finish Levi
---
Nah you're dead on, thanks for this &lt;3
---
Awesome enjoy!  I only recently started using the Devour/Nezerac build on my Warlock and I love it!
---
What about the restorative mind?
---
Play Destiny while doing coke....
---
oh getting 100k in hollowed lair even with deaths is pretty easy with the correct multipliers. I was just wondering if it was worth it to kill all the mobs or skip and just go straight for the boss instead. Thank you!
---
I only did it once after i saw that it was just a different boss and got an overgrown ugly weapon
---
You have to kill the two mini hydras that spawn with the Minotaur.
---
Here you go.
---
I love all these shaxx posts. Everytime I go through comments I imagine reading them with his voice.
---
I find it difficult to find the right time and activity to use it. Your allies probably don't need the noble rounds in casual activities, and there are better options geared towards ad clear/dps that are more useful in end-game activities. It's a fun exotic to use, but not the most effective.
---
The-That-Well
---
This is probably true. I should note I play on PC
---
There are more than  a couple you can wardcliff/shoulder charge off the map.
---
Personally, I still invade with queenbreaker
---
Sure it’ll still be in the meta but it won’t be broken imo
---
If you’re doing stuff like GoS, 980s, stuff like that for pinnacles
---
The fallen deserve better
---
Your damage is determined by your powerlevel, so an individual weapon that is low on powerlevel will still do normal damage. 
---
Infusing it and raising its powerlevel will increase your overall powerlevel, thus increasing the damage it does.
---
I did this today and it only took about 10 mins to get a fire team together - much easier
---
Definitely the former
---
It's the dreambane armor
---
The description of the mask does not mention health regeneration, but it is instead incorporated with the overshield (I'm not sure tho). In my opinion, it will probably continue to have an advantage in crucible games with small teams(survival, etc.), but in Control and Iron Banner, the overshield was definitely more powerful than the tracking.
---
I did like that touch where they just gave you a horde of fallen dregs and what not so you could mow them down
---
Individual power of weapons and armor does not matter at all. Doesn’t impact defense or damage in either case. What DOES matter is your power level averaged across all gear (the gold number displayed) compared to the light level of the content you’re playing. I forget the exact thresholds but if you’re at the light level you’ll do normal damage. Above the light level you still do normal damage. But substantially below (like more than 10-20 power) and you’ll deal less damage and take more. Eventually it gets to the point where enemies become immune to you, but that’s very rare these days. 
---
TLDR; all that matters is you’re average power at or above the level of the content you want to do
---
That’s it. I’ve been happy with the content stream up to this point but this isn’t okay.
---
It’s used because its bodies do the same as crits. Other weapons can out damage it already with crits in PvE and PvP, but people like using recluse to just ape everything. I’m big excited for the nerf cause it’ll make PvE shit not super easy now.
---
Ohh. I thought you meant Awoken colors. Purple and Blue made sense
---
Except the one on the left is far squishier
---
Have you done the triumph using that? Do I need to wear all dream babe or half that and half missy vex stuff?
---
Don’t. It’s low effort
---
Thundercoil, Battery is the shield. Use Synthoceps, Syntho by itself with the melee does a little over 200 and can one shot you just have to hit more than one person. With thundercoil and syntho or dune marchers you probably hit upwards of 250 dmg. It'd hurt a super, doubt it'd kill it.
---
Pfff sentinel shield barely blocks anything.
---
Yup I've completed the triumph while using the dreambane armor the vex armor does not count at all
---
Idk If anyone would be Interested but I posted a video with clips like this one on my YouTube:Vengeful03
---
Hardly
---
When divinity legit has a ttk of 2 seconds in pvp
---
That guy was obviously an idiot. It literally takes 10 seconds to just test it out and prove him wrong
---
I'm so sad, that's the only thing holding me back from the Wayfarer title. Is there a schedule of when Mercury will be up, next?
---
Baby Yoda is still pretty damn strong you know

I mean, he did lift like a 500 kilo Rhino lookin thing

I think it's more of moving forward, how miniscule the actual gameplay content of season pass will be considering their charging 10usd for a season. Don't get me wrong the weapons and armors are nice and from the perspective of a f2p player it makes sense. But for those that folk over full price for the game and expansions. Having to pay 10 bucks for such minimal effort on bungie part sucks.
---
Sorry man, I'm on Xbox 😭 thanks for the offer though!
---
Interesting. Warlocks are my least killed, but not by a big margin.
---
I have ~6000 kills.
---
Approx 1600 are warlocks. Approx 1800 are titans. The remaining 2600, Hunters.
---
Wait how? You don't need Shadowkeep for invasion. Just finis opening quest on Moon, and Ikoras first quest and it opens up from Moon. Alternative way is to grind all daily bounties, and do same on all destinations
---
City dance is the best default dance
---
No, only in the nightfall
---
1) Weak force.
---
2) Learn something about physics before making a fool of yourself in public.
---
3) I can't even imagine what's going on in your brain that leads you to that "crush the universe in ten minutes" statement, but it sure the fuck isn't anything you actually learned.
---
SEND THEM HOME CRYYYYING
---
Or the poster has no clue what they are doing
---
I have noticed that weapons with a power level lower than the suggested seem to under-perform. I pulled a 750 shotgun out of my vault during a GoS run and it barely tickled the things I shot with it.
---
So this just appeared on the dreaming city along with some very big floating taken things... the black balls with space shader  https://imgur.com/n5JYnWX aynone know what it is and how to open it?
---
Glancing the edge of a Fanatic zappy puddle is great for this, just ding yourself when you need a recharge; the damn puddles last forever.
---
Now all we need is something that empowers us from Ogre spam....
---
You are now on the vex offenders register.
---
Before the end of the season seems a bit unlikely, but I don't think there would be any problem in waiting till next season.
---
why not git gud?
---
*Defeat Enemies*
---
replace the Dredgen with Unbroken 🧐
---
This is literally the most fun I've had playing pvp, I don't get many kills but it's great
---
Zavala abandoned Cayde. When I have the option to join the darkness you bet your sweet ass I will just to pop one in his awoken head.
---
Sad to hear - on which platform are u playing?
---
ok boomer
---
*qrabs recluse and one eye* im sry son butnim just doing my job.
---
Is this in the dungeon?
---
I don't think he has any Forsaken exclusive functions aside from holding some Forsaken side quests in case you abandon them. Do you have any quest that looks like a gold envelope?
---
Weird. According to my kills it's mostly hunters.
---
I am quite good ×D using warlock ftw
---
Legacy nightfalls were nightfalls as they were for the entirety of year 2. Nightfall ordeals were added with Shadowkeep. 
---
Strikes don't have any exclusive loot, it's only nightfalls that drop the unique item such as Mindbender's Ambition.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if dregs in the edz have a higher kill count then good chunk of the rest of the enemy pool
---
🎶How you gonna hate from outside the bubble when you cant even get in??🎶
---
Nice
---
There's three bowls around each area that spawn a glowing ball that you dunk on the 3 platforms to open the chest for some *very* mediocre loot.
---
Well depends on what you want pve or PvP god rolls.
---
You’re insane
---
Im on Xbox but it’s just that I don’t have foresaken lol. Came back after a long break from destiny and trying to clean up and get stuff done that I have now before I get either foresaken or shadowkeep
---
The lust dance
---
What a hero
---
I'm just a warlock playing crucible hahaha XD I dont have a bugaloo bubble hahahah
---
Im not gonna spend money on an award, so here's the highest medal I can give you 🗿
---
Aye I can definitely show you around! I've been playing casually-to-seriously depending on the time of year. What's your PSN?
---
Thank you! HatrslimTTV. I'm still on rn.
---
cayde 6 cant die if you jist dont play forsaken
---
Titans are Marines.  
---
Hunters are Scouts.
---
Warlocks.. are... Forward Artillery?
---
I think once you hit 950 gear score, you can only get stronger stuff from raids and Nightfalls. I might be wrong though
---
Because I’d like to actually play rather than load in, get two kills and have the game end.
---
Yeah looking good in the game will really carry you far in pve and pvp. Good job playing yourself dude.
---
Back then Zavala and Ikora were the ones that finished the last Forsaken quest. I got my cloak from Ikora. I tinking hard but I can't come up with any other reason why it's not working for you.
---
Ok I'll add you in a couple when I hop on!
---
Can we all agree that baby “yoda” is absolutely adorable
---
Awesome! Thank you again!
---
And they have 6 six eyes and 3 brain cells between them all
---
No problem dude! Always love to see new people getting into my favorite looter shooter!! Btw added ya!
---
Lol I've had fun so far, but it just gets confusing. I seriously appreciate the help
---
I completed the quest within the last month or so I played at launch and lost interest with Curse of Osiris decided to get back into it with whole new light free to play thing and now my completionist itch is failing to be scratched and its pissing me off I feel like my time isnt being rewarded and the issues are on the back burner while they continue to roll out content...which far be it for me to bitch about a continuous effort from a developer to fight boredom but come on why have a goal clearly shown on the bottom of my triumph tab if I can never reach it?
---
garden raider, fuck those plants man
---
Me when I got the whisper catalyst
---
No Wtf, gtfo. You don't even understand what you're asking for.

Go whine about something else.

that is also true, but i see cancer loadouts more commonly in iron banner than anywhere else.

Congrats man, you clearly deserve it more than me, since the game seems to think I’m not worthy of getting the sparrow or ship, can’t remember which one, which is the only thing I need for the seal, even after hundreds of hours poured into the game and in gambit 👌
---
Thanks, mate!
---
You're just bad mate, git gud that's all. Rage and be salty all you want, it's useless. =)
---
Undying is officially the easiest seal. Probably the least impressive next to Dredgen.
---
Could you please put a dropbox link if you have one?
---
Every time I die it’s either a bullshit GL shot or recluse and they aren’t even aiming. But such is the game we choose to play. Side note: am I the only person who likes using the graviton lance?
---
I just need a leeeetle more Gambit.
---
friendzoned by the drifter
---
Zavala made a decision that made absolutely no militaristic sense or even in humanity's best interests.
---
Securing a shattered/fragmented rift and ensuring the Awoken would know they could count on the Guardians, would've provided them a definitive foothold in the region, as well as MAYBE unifying the remaining awoken again.
---
The only time where we're seen as ultimately superior to every other guardian, is during the Red War, where all other's (for whatever stupid reason ) were not connected to the light anymore. (Unlike us), which means they had their mortality to consider.
---
In turn, he showed the entire region that no matter WHO is MURDERED, be a civilian or a high ranking member of the vanguard, Zavala WILL NOT ACT. It aggravated the divide between OUR character, and the REST of Humanity.
---
There was NO point on that. There were NO benefits on that. Just Zavala acting out of plot interest and actually against Humanity's interests.
---
But if the point we are taking is entirely in the bubble, I have to leave it to kill stompy bois.  Which means Im not in cover from snipers. I will be shot full of holes. If I focus snipers then im gonna be stomped off the map. Its a no win situation. How would you counter it?
---
So that's why the helmet stays on
---
Enjoy fusions this season. They'll be gone next season. A lot of people will be using them next season since the recluse is getting nerfed
---
The chalice was made for the old armor system - so I guess this is actually normal yes.
---
I'll be running my Exit Strategy, and for my Void lock, I'll be replacing Recluse with my curated Kindled Orchid
---
criss brown, look at me now ? lmao nice reference
---
Which part of the quest are you struggling with?
---
"The Undying Goblin"
---
Got curated from my 3rd try, roll is good enough for pvp so I guess its over?
---
I love destiny 2 but what really STILL annoys the shit out of me is when i'm swapping weapons to compare stuff and then go back to my original loadout, and somehow even my kinetic weapon now has 0 ammo... Apparently somewhere in the confusion i just threw ALL OF MY AMMO AWAY... i had to melee some dreg in Archer's Landing to be able to shoot stuff again.
---
Hahah also me
---
 I have my charred celery,  3 coupons for ramen, and a perfectly normal coin.
---
Its so cute!
---
I may have lied, I think I used Ophidian Aspects a couple of times for the weapon improvements PvP but it also improves Melee.
---
He makes everyone feel at least a little thorny
---
Hard mode activated!

F
---
Real OG’s remember the mystery 3 part bounties where you had to slowly reveal the objective
---
If you wanna play, you gotta pay.  :)
---
Woah..
---
I really don't get how people can complain that warlock supers are OP... they seem to last much less, take longer to cast and have zero defense capability. Most of the time, unless I'm running Void, I don't even feel like using supers in PvP
---
its was I, DIO
---
Just open engrams and prime engrams until you get one.
---
Isn’t there a quest or a vendor i make buy from?
---
Tlw really has no place in pve, but a shotgun and a pulse aren't that bad (depends on the roll of course)
---
Every review I've read say it works really well on the founders kit included Chromecast Ultra, but it's basically unplayable on anything else. Pc and android experiences have been very much sub par.
---
Wait till he finishes that beer.
---
While in super your Icarus dash is buffed and if used properly can go way further than missile can
---
Yeah that's what I'm seeing which is good for me because that's how I'll play it 95% of the time
---
Aside from what everyone else mentioned, you had no intention of doing damage, you had your hand cannon out like a douche.
---
You won't be able to. It basically only works as advertised on the included hardware, and even then not very consistently. If you're happy to keep moving a Chromecast Ultra and lan adapter around the house, and can plug in ethernet in every room then maybe you'll find a use case. But if you're expecting to be able to just play around the house on your laptop or android device, it just isn't going to work currently. You're talking about half a second lag on pressing a button and seeing an action in those scenarios.
---
Still a better love story than twilight.
---
The caves in Mars look amazing. It's the start of one lost sector. Can't remember the name of it
---
This memes deaaaad
---
Oh okay.  Still super far stretch though haha
---
A friend is a start to something, best friend is where most people wanna die
---
I get that , I can put up with playing it in the living room and games room for now untill the service gets better !
---
*Why I started*  well I am a day 1 player still hanging on
---
Love the one that makes you a master at floating cartwheels.
---
Agree.
---
Well... Maybe? I dont know what trinity ghoul does at the moment
---
I always do this but shit has so much health
---
Half a second also would not bother me to be fair , when you button bashing would it really matter ?
---
Found the Titan
---
ngl i used a rampage + kill clip roll to farm my randy's in momentum
---
Mostly depends on playstyle. 
---
Reapers kill ads, collectors collect motes, invaders invade the other team, sentries watch out for the bank and invaders.
---
Definitely the wrong sub to ask this.
---
Most people here don't play on stadia and a lot of them look like their "opinion" is based on;
---
1. "Lol i have a gamer pc why would i"
---
2. "I saw posts about it saying its bad"
---
with little to no actual knowledge about the current issues stadia has.
---
To answer your question however; It needs time. Google is currently taking a few big hits because they made false statements (like not all games being available in 4k60fps, codes being send out with heavy delays and the like) and on top of that people spread negativity due to their own issues ("Stadia bad, i have datacaps", "Why can't i play with mobile internet?", basically..). The few reviewers that know what they talk about said the game runs just "okay", just at lower (1080p60fps) resolution than promised and with 30-50ms more input delay. Tests also showed that "away from home" (i.e. at your family) works just fine, the quality of the stream will adjust if the speed is too low and will always only stream at a low enough quality to avoid ping issues.
---
After all it works; it just doesn't work as promised as of right now. Time will tell if google is able to solve those points.
---
Personally however; I'm not interested until cross-play is available (which is being worked on), cross-save just doesn't cut it.
---
It was D1s Eternal Warrior
---
I got 3 days I think to finish it. Only missing the chest and I've probably received 15 gauntlets. It's infuriating. I had gotten a rather easy one (25 forge completions) but that expired before they "fixed" the quest for the 2nd time.
---
I think I’m gonna have to get one. 
---
Last night I was watching Gothalian stream and he’d started the game, loaded into the tower and then loaded into the moon and was in a lost sector in the time it took me to load the game and get halfway to the tower haha
---
The only weapon you listed here i remotely enjoy from activities that is a random drop is monte carlo, thats my go to for titan tank build. Everything else is just medoicre in my opinion.
---
It gets lonely in space I tell ya.
---
People, Ted, The
---
I grinded for sleeper stimulant and it's not even that powerful :(
---
you can ignore me, but it's actually just 15% of registered [braytech.org](https://braytech.org) users. Not 15% of the entire player-base. So a triumph like solo flawless Pit of Heresy is actually a lot rarer than the .62% it says. Assuming that only a fraction of D2 players use braytech.
---
The only thing being nerfed is the ability to crit body shots, and are going to do the damage they're supposed to do. So if you were skilled enough, it doesn't make much of a difference...it's still going to be a better option than other variants like Hero's Burden, or the Arc alt Subjunctive.
---
If you use Freelance Comp (solo queue), you don't get punished for losses nearly as much (I was losing maybe FOUR Glory per loss) and the gains are bigger. Most people barely struggled to get to 2100.
---
If you complete the bounty, it doesn't expire. 
---
Also, raid armor counts. I don't know if that helps you, but that helps me with the weapon bounties.
---
Ahhhh, a fellow of quality
---
Not sure what you mean by "stack up" mods.  Mods are now permanent unlocks so once you have a mod you can unequip and reequip it infinitely.  Acquiring mods is a little trickier but the easiest place to get some is just by turning in gunsmith materials to Banshee and by buying his daily rotating stock
---
Thanks
---
Still baby
---
Sorry that the obvious truth is in your face 
---
This season is lazy as fuck
---
Might be H E L L A late but anyone notice how 6 shot golden gun is like the last word while 3 shot is hawk moon?
---
Yeah, You’ve got Xur or random chance
---
It’s true
---
That is the best Destiny poster I have ever se...
---
wait...
---
Eyes up, Guardians!
---
It's still a representative chunk of the community
---
My computer is shit and I have zero editing experience,please dont be too mean.
---
I have multiple rolls of most weapons you have listed. The exotics are good but the legendaries which i was referring to i dont feel tye same way as you. I would love the small step with 1-2 punch but the dozen or so i farmed never dropped with it and i gave up.
---
Yes, more. Good shots, btw.
---
*because recluse* there fixed your comment for you
---
Although I have 0 issues with my load times on PC, an ssd is my next upgrade. Well worth it imo
---
&gt; Again, I disagree. A Warlock can get to a specific point in glide mode and hit the jump button and drop straight down in a controlled fall. Meanwhile, a Warlock can also float down slower for enhanced precision and when you're in just the right spot, drop in that fashion.
---
Just like a hunter can use two jumps to get to a specific point, a last one to cancle out momentum and drop straight down . same goes for titan, who can also float down slower.. none of this is unique or powerful about warlock alone.
---
&gt; Warlocks absolutely have greater control. In return, their flight path is predictable, and they can't gain more height once they're up there, so win some lose some.
---
Correct, warlocks have greater control; but only because their flight path is not only predictable but limited.
---
&gt; But I haven't seen numbers, and I could be sucking at the Hunter, so I admit I may be wrong here. I just haven't seen it.
---
It's hard to put numbers on it for the "base" jump (no abilities/exotics), outside of taking a metric ton of different jumps and check how well (if at all) a given class can do them. &gt;500h on each class including speedruns, out-of-bound glitches and others have shown pretty effectively that warlock definitely has good points, but both hunter (base) and titan (when it comes to abilities/exotics) sadly beat them.
---
They are pretty damn good when it comes to speedruns due to worldline port + icarus dash and such, but that's mostly due to cutting short on the way, not actually making jumps you otherwise couldn't. If only we could get a "burst-glide" on them, that actually makes you go up all the time, instead of the direction you already go. :/
---
Read the rules before posting.
---
I agree
---
Its a pretty stark difference.  I can't count how many times I have gotten into strikes, ordeals, etc  and have either 1) had to wait, 2) got to kill the first wave of enemies, or 3) was able to just bypass entire areas before the others arrive.  What is really fun is every now and then (not often) you can find run to the other teams spawn in pvp.  They have mostly fixed that last one - but that 1 in 1000 where it happens is so much fun.
---
Got chased by one on the exterior of Burnout. Killed the Warlock as he casted it, and rand from C side to A side and it was STILL on my ass. Turned the corner to go inside and there's 3 of the opposing team...including the Warlock.
---
It was at that moment I knew...I was fucked.
---
 those videos are right the emblem has three variations. The blind well is complete luck and very rare. The one with the time trials is just if you want to do time trials. But a definite way You have to get it is to complete all 6 ascendant challenges not speedrun just do them

Would have been so cool if instead of *the same shit* it was a group of like 12 guardians, fighting 3 different minds from 3 different times
---
they should have put the crucible pvp in solarium and not the wormhaven bit - much better scenery
---
They spawn after public events, so wait for one in the Hellmouth. Complete it, kill the Gate Lords as quickly as you can. After I believe three GL kills, the Overlord should spawn.
---
Only difficult part, really, is killing the GLs quickly.
---
It's not so bad. I need Rune Finder III and one more and mine is complete and I started it about a month ago. Just remember to grab the chests on the barge every reset, complete all the bounties, and hopefully you have a crew to target the triumphs (500 imperials for each one). Also getting 3 buffs each week that grants a chance at additional imperials for managerie and other activity completions.

Is there a way to check which ones you are missing?

Any raid armor? I might have a chest piece from GoS so I'll have to test that out.

The other ascendent chests do not reward the emblem but raise the counter on it. In my collection it says 31, but I don't have it and it is keeping me from 2 titles. -.-

Warlocks and novabombs

I don't even know how you get one...

Honestly, I never really thought Recluse by itself was a very strong weapon in PvP by itself. Titans pairing it with One Eyed Mask is where I think it started getting a little annoying, but still didn't bug me much. I built my Hunter around countering the OEM/LoW builds before LoW was nerfed, so I don't see it much of an issue. 
---
In PvE I can just equip Exit Strategy and basically have another form of Recluse regardless. I used it last night in Final Assault with threat detector, surrounded + surrounded spec and it shreds. I had more kills than anyone in the lobby the 3 times I went in.
---
Revolver ocelot
---
Waat?!?! I didn't know that! Thank you! I thought I tried once and it didn't work. Must have done something wrong.
---
Thanks!

No bit of a let down sort of like d1 2 bad dlcs one good dlc then a medioce dlc
---
KK. Thanks. I didn't know loading from director counted. Thought they had to be done in the playlist.
---
Despite the numerous jokes, they're not dumb enough to turn it on within Tower limits.  You transmat it into the final boss arena of Vex Offensive and use it to summon the Undying Mind.  (Who is a Hydra with orange shields that otherwise acts exactly like the previous final boss)
---
Imagine thinking that people spending time and effort to unlock a difficult to get gun should get nothing of value for their efforts, just because some people don't have the time to get it...
---
It’s kinda not as fun solo, but if you do need people to join up on on the rare occasions you do play, you can join my clan as we are building a clan for casual players!
---
Or nerf shotguns
---
All the prime engrams I got
---
It doesn't even matter
---
Thanks for your help!
---
December 3rd, Halo Reach!
---
Yeah, you can do almost everything solo. Once you get to Endgame you can always "Look for Group" using the destiny App if you need people or help.
---
Okay boomer😂 it just sounds like you’re upset because you can’t get PVP kills with any other gun ...why would I sweat so hard to get a gun THAT I DON’T NEED ?? I perform perfectly fine in the crucible without it. The point is that I get messages from haters who are mad that I wreck them in crucible while they are using a load out like OEM , recluse , and outbreak perfected. Meanwhile , I have the “ghost Primus” and whatever the leviathan raid pulse rifle is on.
---
It’s not my fault you wasted your time to grind a gun that shouldn’t be as good as it is in the first place , like yes you should be rewarded for putting in the time and effort , but not as much as you are ...if you can admit it’s broken then you are part of the problem GRANDMA !!
---
YES exactly 
---
I dont know Why but ils the exact same ducking way 
---
2 small useless dlc one big good dlc and one meidiocre medium dlc

It's to never assume on a community as a whole based on the small fraction you are associated with.

Not everyone uses Reddit and much less use braytech.

Seeing as how i mainly pve anyway the nerf doesnt seem too bad
---
Your submission has been removed due to not being DESTINY RELATED. 
---
Please keep all submissions in English and related to Destiny 2. All D1 content including D1 nostalgia are welcome over at /r/DestinyTheGame, however this is the Destiny 2 subreddit where D1 content is not relevant.
---
You’re such an embarrassment. You don’t even know how to correctly use “ok boomer”
---
Don’t get me wrong , I absolutely think you should be rewarded !!  You put in ALOT of time and effort to get it , I just think it is “too good” and you have to admit it is BEYOND broken in pvp or you’re just lying to yourself my friend
---
Well that's because you die to Titans obv.
---
I like parcel because it's an anti shotgunner shotgun. You can shoot at a shotgunner outside of their ohk range, then get your second shot of before they make it to you when they rush. It has a short ohk, but really fast fire rate with my role. Not the best for aping, but great for shutting down shotgun users.
---
She’s absolutely a boomer , did you not read “grandchildren” 😂just go use the recluse before they nerf it and you can’t get pvp kills anymore
---
There is a site thats called d2 checklist which shows you if you have any good rolls even tells you if they are pve godrolls or pvp godrolls
---
Yea more cringe worthy comments from the ghost. When he mentions killing the boss all day I’m thinking he’s gonna have to do that shit without me now that I’ve done 3.
---
LOL
---
No, like I said, loading from the Director doesn’t count toward most quests and pursuits. It won’t count toward the weeklies.
---
Soooo.. you bought the season pass before and now want to spend extra money?
---
Well, a sniper or a shotgun benefit much more from precise enemy location information then the recluse. The recluse just kills everything. Even the mindbenders needs to know when to push.
---
I don’t see the correlation ?? Reddit is on my phone and I can use my phone ANYWHERE , compared to my Xbox which is at home

Played for an hour , no lag , ran smooth ! Good to be back in the Destiny2 universe !

A lot of the story related content you are able to do solo, but there are several matchmade co-op activities such as strikes, forges, or Menagerie where you don't have a choice to play solo. Also, when you get to the more difficult end game content like the raids or higher difficulty Nightfall strikes you will have to lfg for a team.
---
I had that one too. Didn't finish it. Before the forge launching changes, sure, i'd've popped into Bergusia a few times a day, but now *when I remember to check it* oh wait, wrong forge, nvm
---
It's good. Ye. It's only "too good" when master of arms is active. So basically don't attack a recluse player after they get a kill.
---
but with explaining it that way they still may cause confusion which may cause unnecessary wipes. i’m just saying that relying on a team to teach you if you’re going in blind isn’t the best idea. getting a sherpa team or a team that knows what to do with somewhat of an idea of what you’re doing, in my experience has helped me with many raids. if you just watch the guides he makes, sure they’re long, but that will most likely save you more time in the long run because of how quickly you’re able to pick up the mechanic than if you’re just going in blind trusting that the team is made of good teachers and patient people which is pretty hard to find.
---
Fair
---
If you play on Xbox I can help you with scourge of the past
---
If you leave two matches in a day you get a temporary ban, and some companies like blizzard have better systems because they have dedicated servers instead of peer to peer connection
---
You ask me they should nerf it so hard its never picked up again I'm so tired of seeing it
---
Wish it was a blade barrage so I could use that as my desktop. I'm racist against filthy warlocks but that looks amazing though.
---
What is the name of that hand cannon?
---
Every 5 ranks after 100 gives u a nostalgic engram
---
Fair enough view point. However I feel the tv it should at least be a little viable due to its status as a pinnacle weapon
---
Yea , from what I understand the recluse is essentially going from “constant headshot” to a “2 stack of rampage” which will still be NICE in PVE with a minor spec on for ad clearing ...it will just “bring it back down to earth” for pvp , maybe I’ll try for it eventually. Comp is just such a sweat fest and I get by just fine without it , so it’s hard for me to get the motivation to actually get it ...I’d consider myself pretty good at crucible so I doubt it would be that hard , but i just need to actually get around to doing it (I’m a terrible procrastinator) lol
---
Fair enough. Still think it makes it way harder though. I never thought you really needed mics or a organized team for something like a raid, but now I get it. If you are a team that runs together often I could see not needing mics. but as a rando pickup group? I think it would be hard to get that organized and on the same page enough to do it mic-less. 
---
Honestly dogs was the hardest out of everything. Partly because we couldn't nuke then fast enough, partly because it was the first encounter and it took a while for the group to click and work out a good comm system.
---
outlaw+rampage? or hc mod?
---
I play on PC but I appreciate the offer.
---
Does not increase damage on the tagged enemy (common misinterpretation)... only after you kill the tagged enemy and even so, only affects ttk of a few guns in niche situations (Ace with memento proc'd namely)
---
Bungie seems to only care about the 1v2 potential and not the 1v1 issue everyone actually cares about, including myself.  Wish bungie would just enable recovery off kills without marking.
---
Sincerely, 
---
-A titan main, uses OEM, sorry that I'm not sorry
---
1. U can’t. Just dismantle them
---
2. No
---
3. No
---
4. It matters since u can only use 1 exotic weapon and armor piece at a time
---
Its rules pve and pvp metas for the past year almost and it's still this strong. Pinnacle or not it needs to be nerfed hard so other weapons can shine
---
You got level 110 and got an engram from that
---
Yeah that’s what I’m saying. Even though it is a pinnacle it should be nerfed to a point where it still has viability but there are many other things that can be used
---

---
Warframe Veteran (&gt;3000h, basically everything unlocked) here.
---
Compared to Warframe, where you can literally solo (as in; no squad) everything, Destiny has forced matchmaking on certain activities you can't really avoid (like strikes) that throws you into games with other people. Endgame rewards (980's, raids and the like) are also locked behind 3-6 player groups, with no matchmaking and while you certainly can solo a lot of endgame content (like dungeons and 950's) it's far from efficient compared to a team. Several quests also feature missions that are pretty hard compared to normal runs and have no matchmaking.
---
If you want to play solo because you don't have the time to find people and such you can always use the LFG to find groups for those, or search for a clan that doesn't mind you only being online 1-2 per week only and most activities will match you with people. If you want to solo because you don't want to rely on other people however (like Warframe allows you to do) that ain't really gonna work.
---
Thx.
---
Also this: are there the same weapons and armors with different energy?
---
You know what annoys me the most though they killed breakneck but not recluse lol
---
Sun shot
---
Shame they spent annnnny resources on the floor that is stadia
---
How much xp does turning in her weekly give you? He was 33k into the next level
---
Yeah that’s true. It would have been the thing to use with the new rampage spec mods
---
I feel like recluse will still be better as long as you can be accurate tbh
---
So Ikora tricked me!  Sneaky little warlock made me think SHE was giving me something extra....
---
There’s no such thing as a hard copy of forsaken those copies came with a code
---
Shaxx and his helmet
---
The source would be when they told us upfront what we were buying and all of that content was delivered. The road map is easily available and I won't bother linking it. 
---
Going off the pretence of "well they didn't say it's done" is naive and misleading with zero evidence of being the reality of this situation.
---
1- some vendors have a small selection, but for the most part you get weapons and armour as drops/activity rewards. Try doing something like menagerie or VO that either let you choose what you get, or at least give a lot of stuff. You'll need to unlock these activities though.
---
2- unfortunately no, though that was a thing for weapons in year 1.
---
3- also no, you need to infuse equipment up to keep it leveled, though you shouldn't do this much until you're near the level cap unless you get an incredible roll. Infusing a duplicate piece of equipment (the same gear, just a different power level) is significantly cheaper, also.
---
4- legendary weapons get an extra perk, and legendary armour gets.... Universal ornaments? And more mod slots or something. Though the armour pieces that have the highest rolls are legendary, so you should definitely have all legendary when you're done with leveling.
---
What about Ace and Gary?
---
Me too. I just got it. I had an alh one that I liked, but I'm gonna try the 12p. I hear it's all the rage.
---
How do you turn of the HUD?
---
Appreciate it I'll take a look
---
Thanks, that's what I was thinking as well
---
No, I use it for pve but as usual the pvp bitches cried the loudest so now its getting neutered.  Well done children
---
What about missions to unlock weapons like the gambit mission to unlock the braytech werewolf? I already finished the mission and I unclock the weapon, will it be unlocked on a new character?
---
Laughs is mnk
---
3. What is the difference between merging two duplicates with different energy and just swaping the  one with the lower energy with the one with higher energy?
---
Wait you can shoot them?
---
Don't take it personally. I'm just sick of these change my mind posts, they're overdone and old.
---
Man I wish I had enough time to grind out Undying. I’ve been using recluse almost exclusively in VO and I *still* don’t have enough kills. Everything else is almost empty in terms of kill triumphs. It pisses me off that it’s exclusively this season, cause it’s the closest title I can get besides Dredgen, but I only have like 20 days to get Undying. Dern jobs and adulting
---
Which means you haven't checked the notes, because the very first line already says they removed the precision damage bonus from the buff. That alone is already a nerf of about \~17.3% (PvE) / 24% (PvP) on headshots. On top of removing body shots dealing precision level damage.
---
It's not trash by far, but it's still getting hit pretty hard.
---
Weapons: no, damage type is tied to the weapon type.
---
Armor: yes, it's set at random upon getting it.
---
if you don’t wanna do the survival grind. which only takes like 3 hours for an unskilled player, you can just get exit strategy, the gambit ritual weapon. from what i’ve heard it feels a lot like recluse
---
I would call game sensitivity a “play style”... A play style would be like; Tactical, camping, etc not “oh it takes you 3.1 million seconds to turn around. 
---
Why not tell developers to adapt? When every other game in this universe has game sensitivity that’s faster than “3”. (Destiny’s 10 is a 3 compared to all the other games out there) 
---
So, No. Developers need to adapt. That’s why Destiny 2 isn’t even a Top 10 most played game.
---
I've been playing since D1 year one get outta heeah
---
^im ^just ^dumb
---
With titans, your primary weapon is your first, the guns are all secondary. The abilities are cool, but are rather secondary (especially when your ability is a wall) 
---
And as a long time Titan main, you should take warlock. Titans are really lackluster right now, and warlocks are on the rise.
---
Yup. Sometimes lag will cause some weird deaths. Anyone that's played any game with some lag though will be able to tell the difference between that and a hacker.
---
If I'm farming for mindbenders ambition when I finish the nightfall will I always get it to drop or is it random
---
Most people who play pvp are playing for kills. That's their fun and that's why they use the recluse. When the recluse isn't the best any more, most people will move on to what is best.
---
Titans, we have better jumps than u warlocks!!! 
---
MUAHHAHAHAHA 😈😈😈
---
lol nah but seriously, it depends cuz if u play solo then titan, it's easier to play solo, but warlock if u have friends / people to play with so u can be their support, u know well of radiance, or dawn blade, etc. But titan if u play solo cuz well titans are just more fun solo, but still good in case u do have friends to play with, use the word of dawn and ur good
---
Maybe but only on PC, i don't think it would be fair to push changes like that onto the console player base because of hackers on PC.
---
It can also role demolitionist giving an alternative to Gnawing Hunger for a Nezzy boi's primary
---
Shoulda called em the Deathsingers...
---
Depends on your style, hunter or titan is brute and warlock is more mobile

Guilty as well.

Nil Those both slap, in pve and pvp

Both your own and others.
---
Also I recommend getting the D2 companion app. Really handy.
---
oh yeah definitely, I wish they would separate the changes between the systems.
---
The artifact mods are pretty bomb but other than that I agree with you bud
---
That was my initial spot, but it’s gets annoying because the hive like to play hide and seek in the different containers in the room.
---
I played battlefield 2 growing up while playing on a toaster. I wasn't good at it but it definitely have me a good foundation for fps games. That and halo custom edition is what got me into fps games and PC gaming.
---
Even without Izanagi's, weapon swapping with an auto-loading swarm does more damage than manually reloading a full court L&amp;D. Firing line/auto-loading tranquility pairs beautifully with it.
---
Now I understand people's complaints about wall hacks being overpowered.  
---
Nice plays though.
---
Uh have you guys done Whisper or Outbreak yet
---
It’s really only in Momentum Control where I agree. I’m a hunter main and it’s downright unfair with wall hacks. But in comp it’s not a huge problem especially with the recent nerf to wall hacks during spectral blades.
---
Right 😂😂
---
"your vibe, hand it over"
---
Snitch
---
I hate every bit of this lol
---
Yeah, it is a really great weapon. But i only found out about it a few weeks ago on a reddit post. Then i checked if i had it, and then i claimed it. For a year i didnt know some weapons had a cool option like this one. I use it a lot now, hope you will get it soon.
---
I was in a group where the “leader”, who lacked any real leadership traits tried explaining the last phase of Last Wish with the orbs. He started the explanation with “To extend the time of the orb you need to jump through taken essence”.... I stopped him right there and said this makes no sense without any context and methodically explained the objective, the roles required, and the process/flow of the encounter. We got it in two tries. I’ve been in KWTD LFG groups that took 5-10 tries, on what is the easiest section of the raid.
---
"There was an error loading the Bungie Manifest DB, please refresh the page and try again. "

Thank you kind lizard
---
Also could get some of the trophies or whatever for the bad juju catalyst if you haven’t done that yet. That’s a good way to throw away excess shards/planetary mats and glimmer lol
---
I love watching him so much lol he’s just got a great streaming personality honestly !! And yea , my ass has been around since the beginning beginning of D1 back in the day lol so i remember self Rez days with the warlocks when they were truly OP , what a truly great time that was to be alive 😂😂😂so to me everything is way more balanced but I can also see where you’re coming from if you just started at forsaken 
---
And oh alright I totally get what you’re saying now , that’s my bad I somewhat misunderstood what you were saying , I can def agree to the fact that I’ve gotten more lights out with my warlock then my hunter for sure lmao 😂I truly feel like it’s impossible to 100% balance everything because no matter what numbers hardly ever come out perfect and I feel like this is an example of that lol
---
Accidentally did this with a group last night. Well + Divinity + 2x Izanagi. Mistake on our parts though. Ended up just below 100k. Had to run the whole thing again.
---
Me and 0.2 k/d
---
Well it’s top tree for the double nade. And infinite shoulder charge is just as annoying. That’s why I just snipe golden gun so atleast player I go against dont think I’m “that try hard”
---
Exit Strategy is also pretty great.
---
Before you go to any activity, pick up the related bounties. You'll be 100 in no time.

Nightfall the Ordeal has matchmaking for the 2 lowest difficulties. Plus, if you dont have a group, here is the official PC LFG, with 300,000+ members: https://discord.gg/gTRKQ4

I'm guessing spider? He's a pain I usually avoid using him as a clutch since it's only for when I feel it's absolutely necessary to go (aka when I finally waste all my glimmer after a weekly rest for some of that menagerie godrolls (2 so far and I'm loving both smgs that I have in my daily load out)
---
Some people are just concerned that the stuff in future seasons will be like season of the undying's content size wise, minus shadowkeep.
---
Honestly, I'm not too worried about it.
---
Fair points bud
---
In terms of pvp I think it's just the fact that I get killed by shoulder charge and handheld so often that it annoys me, as I win my 1v1's pretty consistently yet I die to something that doesn't require all that much skill 
---
And I'm terms of pve, celestial and orpheas do add a lot you're right, but to me hunters don't feel like they have the travellers power in them when using supers in the same way it feels when using supers like hammers or dawnblade
---
I may have to give that a shot with some substitutions.  I've got everything except TLW (on the second to last phase of that quest, might farm it this weekend) and the Bear's Roar.  Would you suggest I use a zenobia with cluster?  probably my best rocket.  I'm steadily climbing using Luna's on my hunter, currently at Mythic II, but anything that'll help my play a bit is welcome.
---
That was a thing? I didn't get destiny at that time, but damn that looks pretty fun.
---
Fair point man, it is difficult to balance a game like destiny in terms of pvp especially :)
---
Play prometheus lens and have fun in this mode
---
I thought it said: My Dad spectating which would be kinda funny aswell
---
Ok, how do I do that?

True bud, Stompees are the quintessential hunter exotics for pvp
---
hmm it works for me
---
All the random blues I get after a crucible match
---
I’ve already done all the Zavala bounties for today and yesterday. That brought me up about 2 levels. Just keep grinding I guess
---
Well, I mean they were worked on at the same time, unlike opulence for example and I feel we will go back to those levels or close for dawn

bruh its just hawthorn's dialogue
---
Yet another titan over compensating for "inadequcies"?
---
Ah. Yes. The old “lets all rush him one person at a time and absolutely NONE of us have close range weapons” strat
---
For context the reason I’m posting this is I’m getting tired of these elitist players who rag on anyone who has the Dredgen title. Yes it’s the easiest one but when out of 1.5 million only 15% have the easiest title then that says something. For any of the titles you have to work and put in the time for it. Hell that screenshot was my stats and that’s after 115 games of Gambit because the Pillager won’t drop.
---
it also look awesome
---
I would have really enjoyed some raid/dungeon elements to this, like a jumping puzzle or something that doesn't require a lot of communication, but is still fun to complete and somewhat challenging. This was a pretty major disappointment after all that time watching the portal being built.
---
Crying doesn’t get you stuff in destiny you have to work for it Chief this isn’t year one anymore 
---
And if you have to pay for pinnacles 
---
Just sell you gaming equipment at this rate

It says on the gun. Just run strikes and crucible

If OP is talking about the triumph you HAVE TO KILL THE HYDRAS FIRST. There is a different overlord that will spawn at the end. You cant just melt the regular overlords.

It felt so good to be the one holding it

Haha that's hilarious

Are you talking about the triumph for all 3 areas?

Pretty sure that was just a theory... and I’m only saying melt them to make sure you don’t run out of time.

The new chest piece (can’t remember what it is) that powers up your stormtramce for every kill you get with it , paired with top tree stormtrance is SUPER TOUGH !!

If not I run top tree dawnblade with the sunbracers for that super long grenade burn !! 
---
Not a big void fan unless I’m nova bombing in PVE , even then I still prefer geomag stabilizers paired with chaos reach !!
---
My first roll was spike/fieldprep/quickdraw, haven't gotten full court at all yet.
---
Got one with moving target and kill clip though, that one was a knee-slapper, mf hand cannon perks on a gl

The range limiter of SMG dictates that compensation is ultimately pointless since you are going to hit at close range regardless and at long your damage will be so minor a crit wouldn't matter.
---
Sorry, didn't realize you needed that.
---
I had a teammate who in this situation would just jump off the map and suicide

You get a triumph for getting or witnessing someone the perfect score
---
When you are doing petras run for the first time after 13 clears and you are running back from your second plate which spawns one of the ogres and then everyone yells who spawned the ogre and at that very moment you realize that every single team you have raided with did it the hard way for no reason, that being the raid challenge way, and then you get booted for being incompetent.

The purpose is to achieve max score and get the giant cake.

Oh dealing with spider was hell. Didn’t have the money for shadowkeep so I just bought the season pass by itself for now. I finally hit rank 100 yesterday and waiting for his resets when I finally ran out of the materials for glimmer he’d be selling every material he had for glimmer. There was one day though that he was trading something for glimmer and offered it for shards to. I don’t think I ever want to do a strike bounty again after that.
---
Ha I didn't know that existed
---
Oh wait, the cake is a lie 😁
---
Definitely not just a theory, I've done the otherwise 2 areas twice so the check box turns yellow from green but everytime I do hellmouth the blueberries melt the boss too quick or I'm all alone.
---
 I've completed hellmouth multiple times and havent gotten the triumph yet because of that.

Ok, and?

Getaway artist - hands down (lol)
---
Lunas/not forgotten basically.
---
The thing that bothers me the most is the low effort by Bungie.
---
Didn't know about the glimmer thing, but still the triumph gives zero triumph score, what's the point to unlocking it?

I still use my Blue Shift that I got when it was like a 250 light.
---
I only use Nezzy bezzy for pve. Middle and contraverse for pve Handheld super Nova is broken when charging it gives you damage reduction.
---
With contraverse I usually have a supernova ready for every other enounter.
---
I hate Nova warp, though.
---
Most of the time, that is the right call to deny super energy. Was pretty much in the YOLO mentality until after the second kill.
---
Any weapon with a radiance slot will count as a Black Armory weapon, including the non-exotics from the raid. I'm pretty sure the armor doesn't count, but haven't tried it myself.
