Try doing ada ones augmented weapons I got one to drop with outlaw kill clip. The extra perk spot gives you a better chance at one. Granted it’s still not the best odds and only a once a week thing but better than nothing. 
---
Trust or Drifter cooking pot.
---
Unpopular opinion: Having exotics not have the ability to use any shader, and instead having ornaments that completely change the look of the gun, leads to cooler, more complex designs.
---

---
Graviton Lance is a great example, do you want it shaded, or to have a mini universe inside your gun.
---
I think Bungie would patch that in with enough demand, at the cost of new ornaments. They always choose the route with less work involved if given the choice. 
---
2.5k? As in budget 4k?
---
For example on light.gg it ahiws the hidden stats for skyburner’s oath are 20 zoom, 60 weapon size, 100 recoil direction and 90 aim assistance
---
That clip always makes me laugh
---
—Whisper of the Worm
---
  It is crucial at some bosses, such as Morgeth in last wish or the Scourge final boss. But shotgun alternative is doable if your team is ok with it.
---
  I suggest you practice the parkour yourself and then go do it with LFG groups, it’s a lot easier than solo.
---
—Ikelos shotgun
---
  It’s quite important for multiple bosses or majors you have to kill (e.g. knights in vault of last wish) but I honestly think in most situations a random full auto shot gun would not be a detrimental disadvantage for your group. It would also be easy to LFG, and there is probably no way to solo it.
---
—cluster bomb rocket
---
  Sadly this is a definite must have, because no one wants to run through Riven normally. Good news is any rocket works. There is a blue rocket launcher the Cupbearer which can serve as a last resort. 
---
—a good add clear weapon
---
  Not really a must have but makes your life a lot easier. Generally you will want a pulse/auto rifle or a hand cannon with drop mag/outlaw/feeding frenzy + rampage. Blast furnace is a nice one and easy to farm, breakneck is amazing, you just need to grind some gambit, midnight coup from leviathan raid is good if you can find groups.
---
interesting..
---
Do I really need to explain how eyes work?
---
Lol, yeah I found that out soon after posting, I hope they bring it to other platforms soon.
---
How about a shader that let's us do this to any set? I don't exactly like that gear.
---
Watched game. Immediately found the real issue.
---
What was this weapons exotic perk again? I only remember it was a good and fun sidearm.
---
I’m new to PC as of 3-odd months ago. I know loudouts, map positioning and the Rock Paper Scissors that is the destiny sandbox but I’m still getting used to aiming with a keyboard and mouse. I’ve been wrist aiming with really high sensitivity but want to change things around because  feel I lack precision. I put 50-60 hours in the comp playlist this season to grind out the Not Forgotten, however at the top level at 5500 I play against people who’ve already been using the gun for 5000 kills, making the adjustment period (especially as someone with no PC FPS background) hard as hell.
---
Same
---
You lucky duckkkkk youuuuu
---
Grind it out - it took me 15 or so frames but got feeding frenzy rampage and I love it!
---
I have done a few but honestly most of my clan mates can’t be bothered to gambit, and solo is the worst destiny experience possible!!
---
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **7th Cakeday** ashamancurtis! ^(hug)
---
Gonna guess you didn’t main a Titan because that armor looked like garbage
---
Relentless tracker: This weapon grants an advanced motion tracker resolution after a kill.
---
Unrepentant: reloading after a kill makes the next burst longer but more powerful
---
Please let this become a new meme

Exotic armor has the exotic perks that are set, but the other perks like scavengers, dexterities, unflinching aim, etc. are randomly rolled.

Keep practicing. People act like Telesto is an easy win button. It’s annoying, for sure, but you need to live the Telesto life before you really start to shit on people.

I have this sniper but really don’t do much PvP, didn’t think it was that good. I usually run into people who use Tartara Gaze a lot.

I just found out it was 2432x1366

I will do anything to get an effect like that on my armor.

800-900$ ish for a Not Forgotten from most sites and people I’m surprised so many people are still advertising themselves on LFG because I doubt anyone would pay that much money for it

Phoenix protocol vest wit new age black armory shader 
---
It leaves behind bolts that if steeped on can kill you if you have not recovered enough health back. I've had my fair share of people kill me, only to step back and walk into a Telesto bolt that missed them while I was trying to kill them. It also has no damage drop off as opposed to other fusion rifles.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
However, if you want to see how good you are as a fusion rifle main, pick up any of the "non meta" fusion rifles and see how well you do with those. I picked up the Loaded Question about a week ago and so far have a little over 720  crucible player kills with it. Super fun to use lol. I did not use fusion rifles until I came back when Forsaken launched and I got the Telesto, but after palying with that and using other fusion rifles I feel weird not having one in my energy slot now lol.
---
Maybe give the chest a more red shader? But other than that it’s plus ultra!
---
Mod's probably gonna say that this is D1 and that you can't post it here but since it's gotten popular, it will stay.

I miss this and the emote that goes with it with all my heart and soul.

What about weldfire and twilight garrison and bubble actually being good

Yup. Practically a re skin.
---
I hate the hunter gear too. I’d rather not walk around looking like an asymmetrical brine shrimp. 
---
They should do this for season of the drifter 
---
That hunter cape tho. 
---
I like the idea of individually shad-able armor pieces way  more than I like the implementation.
---
One is a lot better
---
How much...
---
Yup I have that exact roll and it does work in gambit and the whisper quest 
---
Lol this one is sold already but I’ll be making more in the future
---
Balanced
---
Could you Ever make a Zhalo?
---
Enough is never enough 
---
I second this. 2 Scavengers and you are good to go. Kill 2 guys push with your Team Pick up special. You just need to balance your game. The only thing that bothers me is the flinch and no real way to reduce it.

But isnt csgo community size in the millions... So even .10% of the pop using cheats it would be far more noticeable than here.
---
But your point still stands.
---
I probably could, but It would cost quite a bit because of it’s size. 
---
I would like a high collar cloak for Warlock, like Purifier Robe from D1.
---
You get the triumph double trouble when you kill the bosses and also two chests. It’s one of the secret ones. Need three people to stand in the circles when they glow. You can leave the area (eg go to blind well) and come back to have a chance at making it glow again. 
---
If you ever had the gun in year 1 you can pull it out of your collections.. I'm just about positive that there is no Y2 version of Minuet, if you get it to drop it will have that same old roll. 
---
well shit... i still have to get the magnets
---
You can get... 100 of them online or something for really cheap from Amazon. I think that's where I got mine.
---
If you're asking how much it cost me to make, not much. If you're asking how much to sell for, that I can't say on here since I don't want to solicit/promote lol

The worst part was when you pop one and just burn all your ammo and then realize you’re fucked for the next 5 minutes
---
Hey, I’m subscribed to you on youtube. Didn’t know you lurked around here too
---
That'd be great. I don't see why an exotic armor piece can even roll normal perks. Exotics should roll strictly enhanced perks. That's the point of wearing that gear anyways, because it's better than others. Why not make it better? Crazy to think you can more likely roll a legendary armor piece with certain perks long before you'd even consider the same roll on an exotic that you use on a daily basis. 
---
I do indeed. Mainly just read and comment on things. Post stuff every so often though :)
---
Ace of Spades, Duke, any decent pulse rifle. Luna’s is not the end all even a little bit. I’d rather 5 Luna’s than five fucking SLIDING DUST ROCK BLUES FUCK
---
Except I have fed almost 2000 gunsmith parts for mods to try and get Rampage Spec for my Breakneck, which puts me at roughly 8 Black Armory mods. I have gotten every shit mod possible and now I am out of resources so it looks like I wont get it any time soon. Its fucking stupid how infrequently they drop.
---
You didn't such before, but you do now
---
Well that's just wrong. Every boss can drop one weapon. It's on a cycle, all 3 for two weeks and then (iirc) shotgun, smg, sniper, and then it repeats. There are no bosses that don't drop one of the weapons, and none that drop two. 
---
Here’s a good example

You think that's lucky? After 3 months of not a single exotic, I get Cerberus +1 from the end of a crucible match then shards of gala not from ranking up because of that match
---
Put the taken ornament on malfeasanse, if it wasn't taken enough for you
---
Especially when the explosion happens and your screen goes white and you can fake that you failed.
---
OK thank you. Now I can stop stressing it for the time being.
---
It’s got some decent perks in it but I use top tree. I wish you had a choice like in D1 too swap out different perks etc like in PvP I’d use three arrows etc (that’s if they killed on impact like the used too) grenades control etc 
---
Let me enlighten you: people are still playing the game. Just create another account on your xbox or ps and start a new game.
---
Really? I remember looking up the drops and the big ogre boss that heals with the cursed thralls didnt say any weapon drops??? Maybe it was an incomplete list, my bad dude
---
Do you remember the D1 loot cave, Pepperidge farm remembers 
---
The fact that you made it this far and accomplished your goal means you don't suck! Congrats and welcome to the club!!
---
I don’t know what that is, it sound like it’s for PC. (I’m on XB1)
---
One eyed mask haha it was a joke about you being a titan. Cause the most broken gear for titan is One eyed mask 
---
They are both quests you can pick up from Shaxx. The steps for Redrix can be done primarily in quickplay although it does require you to play 25 rumbles and 25 comp matches. You need to reset your valor 5 times in one season. That’s the real grind. Luna is earned by hitting 2100 in glory and getting a buttload of hand cannon kills. Both quests are grindy AF but the rewards are quite good. 
---
It is tangled web for sure
---
I got my fourth Hard Light since Black Armory yesterday. 
---
I think it would be a great exotic. I mentioned it in another comment a while back. 
---
I figure it would be nice to have a fast(er) charging primary fusion rifle. The reasoning for it being "kinetic" could be that it's either a railgun, or it's energy could be just pure light. Like it projects a beam of photons. 
---
But I like fusion rifles. So I'm probably kinda biased.
---
Can't fucking relate

I play all 3 classes and they’re all 650.  There’s no way I could just pick one.
---
Honestly never liked those sets, lacks so much detail since its all just takeny looking. It would be better if there was taken stuff seeping out of parts of the armor imo.
---
From every bounty or only the "special" one (the only dropping a powerful engram)?

I think it's a really good idea but I wouldn't make suppressor grenades more powerful than they are right now haha

Nope it should be. They might not though cause it's so good but they said that the slower firing auto rifles will get a boost
---
Same with Oathkeeper. And believe it or not, i really want them. 
---
I don’t mind Spectral Blade as much as Nova Warp. Fuck Nova Warp.
---
Yes the rpm is 450. But with the full buff it's like 1000 lol or more

I’ve had insanely good RNG for the most part. Shards is one of the few things that I don’t have yet. &lt;/3

Sick! I’m working on the 100 hand-cannon headshots right now, got it a couple of days ago and only 50 more to go!
---
Legit makes me excited to see more people grinding this out. I hope it means the game is growing and people are loving it as much as me. 
---
For my warlock it did, but for my titan it happened after spending all my points on the subclass abilities

Do you want to play Destiny 2 base game?
---
Checkpoints have been in for a while

Pmed you
---
Doesn't change my mind that I feel like it's a shitty way of doing it, and that won't change. I will never like afk farming unless it's a feature for the game, such as idle games.
---
Yea dude, i don’t care if its actual money.
---
If i get the stats i want, then i’ll be the ultimate lifeform of a taken chad.
---
Why dude 
---
So if on the very rare off chance he did matchmake with a 650 hindering ONE forge he deserves to burn at the stake? Forges with 650's fail when all 3 people are trying sometimes - OP didn't do a single thing wrong. 
---
You can redue old quest to see him again
---
As a professional battery thrower, I can confirm.
---
Congrats! Damn this could be me some day. 
---
Imo, he did, because I hate afk farming. It's not the right thing to do in my mind. I never said he should "be burn at stake" for ruining a forge. I still stand my point about the method itself being shitty because I hate afk farming.
---
As a good looking Titan…
---
Wtf ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh why would anyone do this to you 
---
What gun is that?  Never seen it before.  Or if I have I have never used it.  Looks like something from D1.

I would like to try “bands that started off really great but sold their soul to appeal to a broader audience” for 200

Dude, I'm' on this grind right now too. My glory is as high as its ever been right now at 650. My friend who is only slightly better than me just got carried to Fabled from some rando on LFG, so that got me kinda salty too.
---
Congrats, I'll get there ...maybe next season.
---
hahaha yeah man!
---
It's honestly not a shitty way of doing it lore has no bearing on the game so it doesn't matter its not like he's cheated his way to a weapon or higher light level 
---
It's just an effective use of his time 
---
Like i said we could actively do 150-300 forges and still not have all the page
---
But someone who did 50 got lucky and finished the lore book
---
Is that person any more accomplished for being lucky whilst the other struggled through more forges? Did either of them EARN their pages? 
---
Choke on your third suros regime
---
The first thing is really shotguns. Right now they are the best short distance weapon only second to a Titan shoulder charge. The load out you'll see the most is Dust Rock Blues (because of rapid fire and it has INSANE range for a shotgun) then either Luna's Howl or Not Forgotten in the special slot. The power can vary from person to person because so many are great, but the one you'll probably see the most of will be Wardcliff Coil (high damage, wide area of damage because of the cluster of rockets). This is what a lot of what you'll see from people that grinded for Luna's or NF.
---
For everyone else the primary is normally a pulse rifle (Bygones, Blast Furnace and Go Figure) or Hand Cannons (Ace of Spades, Trust and Kindled Orchid). You'll see any variety of shotguns and power weapons from there. Polaris Lance will sometimes see use and when people are good with snipers they'll use those but that's kinda rare (at least from what I've played.
---
That's about it really, pretty much all supers are viable to some extent (some being way stronger than others). And of course you'll come across some differences and people running goofy loadouts to mess about and have fun with. I would take this with a pinch of salt though, I'm a very casual crucible player and I only really play Iron Banner, for weeklies and dailies and when I'm grinding a crucible weapon (Redrix was not fun) so I'm just going off of what I've seen. Higher level ranked play may be different but I've never really seen it.
---
TLDR: SHOGUNS
---
yep... well, i got a few, but not much. It's really a shame that the iron banner doesn't give you the trajectory medals, would have gotten some of them as well.. &gt;.&gt;

Izanami when you on the top island and throw it at the forge and miss
---
We miss anything that sounds remotely Scandinavian 
---
I never run this strike with grounded. I've died at that jumper way too many times. I still dont know why it happens.
---
Because i'm one of those guys who rarely play gambit and if i do, i play with clanmates. They quickly learned that a guy with 6 shot golden gun and a sniper is just as effective as someone with heavy. All it takes is some coordination to clear the ads quickly and a little bit of skill from the invader. Use a good pulse rifle to help clearing and keep the bank free. Super mods on armor, special and heavy finder and you are good to go.
---
His response btw to this was "One Eyed mask is too op NOT to use"
---
Comes in a red box
---
talking as if i'm crying, ok bud good luck with that
---
thats so cool
---
I always say something dumb like boom goes the dynamite or swish or Kobe then I see it bouncing away
---
I'm finally creeping up on 600 light after a month of grinding (deaf = no raid). 
---
Think I can take on a forge?
---
Has no one on this post closed one eye before? You should try it because this is not how it works chief. 
---
1st heavy in the game is always for invader. Period.
---
It definitely would change the meta of shotguns and hand cannons if they enlarged the maps. 
---
But to add warthog like vehicles to destiny pvp they would have to do some overhauling with pvp
---
You did grow fat from strength.
---
Good Exotics are like the only last good, non-stale Marshmallows in an old box of Lucky Charms. 
---
Oh, yeah..
---
When I hit 625 or so, the first forge was doable. 
---
Not the most useful of videos and that awful music makes me want to punch some folks in the face. And I'm not even a Titan... 
---
yeah you should be able to with decent randoms and 605ish 
---
1 perk, 2 words. Firmly Planted.
---
I was just asking because In last weeks TWAB, 450 rpm autos weren’t listed as getting a buff.
---
I am not sure if i should report it as a bug to Bungie maybe? it's kinda hilarious, but can be quite annoying in a nightfall run i reckon.
---
PS4 unfortunately. 
---
well i got a random Telesto drop from a last-minute public event
---
But there’s plenty of other options that guarantee you more ammo. Basically any sniper, bow, most pulses, scouts, energy GLs...  Never let heavy be a crutch because it’s more detrimental to your skill and play style than you might realize. 
---
I’ve heard it’s a 5%drop chance for the weapon (but I feel it’s less )from the boss so most likely you won’t get it right away. More then likely you only got shaders and the weapon didn’t drop. 
---
Each week the weapon changes. 
---
Definitely don’t have to reset infamy. There was/is a bug that was causing the wrong team to be credited with the win that was supposedly fixed but saw a couple people saying it still happened to them. 
---
Unfortunate if it has happened twice to you. Next week will be full curse week with the increased spawn rate for it so that could be a good time to try again if you were so inclined. 
---
I love when i do the forges with my friends, becsuse when the batteries bounce off rhey get rrally frustrated. 
---
Because you can go against the meta and still be a beastly guardian? *shocker* 
---
That is fair, but in the context of this conversation, heavy is guaranteed for first invasion, which is what we are talking about.
---
When I run with my friends, I'll regularly use 6-shooter and am the dedicated invader. Between their supers and heavy, the primeval goes down fast enough as is. Plus, it lets me have more fun with my loadouts while still be an effective invader. (And Goldie makes a shit ton of orbs btw)
---
Going solo, shards or tether for sure. Never can be too sure what you're getting with blueberries.
---
I was playing for an hour or so yesterday, and I hit my breaking point I think. It just wasn't fun. Every single quickplay match I used OEM / Parcel / Sniper / Luna's.. and then Gwisin with Spectral on my hunter
---
It just wasn't fun. Going all out every. single. match. Realized I was part of the problem.
---
Switched to Cerberus and a fusion with the 6-shot golden gun... The fun of crucible suddenly came back. Mapping someone with a fusion while they are rushing you with a dust rock feels so good
---
I also didn't care as much when someone killed me with one of those guns... it was more of a "oh cool, you used a dust rock, that's original"
---
I would absolutely recommend this to anyone else out there if you're looking to have some fun. It's even more rewarding when you can lead the entire lobby with guns like this.
---
What time zone?
---
I’m aware they’re speaking about the first invade, which doesn’t change anything I said lol I’m just saying you don’t and shouldn’t need heavy. I’m not trying to chastise those for using it, just trying to get people to understand they can absolutely wreck the other team with the countless kinetic and energy options and can save that heavy for HVTs and Envoys/Primevals.
---
[removed]
---
Nope. If you  can’t even get a shot off on the boss you shouldn’t be wasting someone’s time. You’ve got to do better than that. They might as well have been shooting the ground when the boss came out, which I think is fine to call out if you’re trying to help people and they pull this.
---
who the heck is that
---
Teather works nice too, when the enemy is fighting the Primeevil, shoot it in the right spot and they cant go near it or get caught and the ADDS slaughter them.
---
I tried it for the first time when i was about 605-615. Unless you play with high levels over discord, it will be very difficult to do it since you are matched together with people of similar light. The two last waves will be difficult because the enemies are red.
---
That all relies on you having a super in the first place, and in my experience (casual solo queue/casual group of 2 or 3), no one gets a super until close to the end of the round
---
Probably has something to with the fact it's a grenade launcher. 
---
I wondered that too, but it was happening throughout the match and at other times I saw it damaged, this is just the only clip I captured. But I still need to do some more testing to figure it out completely. 
---
Just wait til 6-Shot gets buffed next week. 
---
This is gonna be fun. 
---
What is 'Wanderer'?  
---
Is that the German version of 'Wayfarer'?
---
I'm here with you bro. 
---
Anthem does :D
---
The exotics they have are just way too good, skull fort is a poor mans OEM, heart of inmost light gives one-shot sticky nades, the new boots they got reflect everything so they can slide and then shoulder charge, the exotics they have just support aping with shotguns and that should not be supported 
---
Lol this happened to me and stole my like 10 win streak me and my fireteam had going 
---
Congratulations! I totally understand you. I love playing but boy do I suck at it...
---
i guess
---
Is the base game and forsaken still populated with people or will I mostly be on my own till high level?
---
How....even?
---
Thank you, just made my grind seem not so hopeless haha. But ive gotten meatball like maybe 5 times since i got this game so hopefully i have better RNG. That and need 5 more kills of an invader popping super and 2 more resets for ghost
---
If I see a hunter tethering I use my super as often as I can. So many orbs.
---
I'm on PC so I don't know how it is on console, but you can still find players at a variety of levels on all planets. There are things to do no matter how far you have progressed, so it is commonplace to see level 50 power level 650 end game players hanging around the very first open world area you reach. 
---
The in-game chat is almost never used, but you can find people to play with on this subreddit's discord (linked in the top right on desktop) or the /r/destinythegame discord (linked in their sidebar). There is also the official Destiny 2 app, /r/fireteams, /r/destinysherpa for raids (do not worry about this until later), or platform-specific things.

Why can't randos understand why I want heavy...
---
I HAVE THE QUEENBREAKER!!!

Thanks guys, I’ll make 3 separate classes instead of deleting and restarting.

But I deleted them because I felt like I messed up and needed to start over instead of just moving forward but I’ll stop doing that

You get it by the time you summon...

Next rounds you just snowball.

610 is recommended but if you have people to carry you 600 is doable.

The reason to buy from Xur is to have the items at all, power level is not the important part here. The only other way to get the exotics he sells is as rare random drops, and I mean *rare*. 
---
By now you probably have a lot of gunsmith materials, tokens, and planetary resources. Turn those in to the appropriate NPC and dismantle what you get in order to get more shards. 
---
Yeah, this is a major accomplishment. Congrats.
---
Hey Guardian, smell my fingers. YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
---
I hear Crimson is a good hand cannon to farm Crucible Headshots for Ace of Spades missions?
---
Honestly you’re probably gonna git the end of the season before you get to 2100
---
That explains it. Will just keep at it then
---
*WELL OT DOESN'T WORK FOR ME
---
Same thing used to happen to me. I uninstalled my graphic card drivers and then reinstalled, and that fixed it for me. Idk why it made a difference but it did. And if that doesn’t work, reinstalling the game always works ;)
---
lets get this to 100 upvotes
---
People like to use it because if you aim at someone's upper chest, the recoil causes later bullets in the burst to go to their head. 
---
I used a variety of hand cannons for Ace of Spades and it didn't seem super noticeable to me. 
---
I did my first at 550
---
Sir, that is correct.
---
This is me but when I'm trying to buy mods from Ada. So many damn Firefly specs and Icarus grips. Not one rampage spec in 50+ attempts.
---
Didn't realize that. I guess I should have been looking at all those duplicates I've been dismantling...whoops.
---
It would be great for all the people that joined after Forsaken. I hope we'll get it.
---
Yeah, it's really tough to think of a good way to nerf Luna without making the entire gun useless. They could do the 3-crit kill for magnificent howl only, but it would probably really hurt NF then. Not 100% sure on that, would have to look at the percentage of final blows being crits with it.
---
But the whole problem with Luna is once you remove the ability to 2 crit + 1 body, then it's essentially a poorly rolled Trust. The range is so bad on it.
---
All that being said, according to Destiny Tracker, about 50% of my total PvP handcannon kills are with Luna, and 57% of of those actual kills are crit shots. So maybe the 3 crits for magnificent howl would work.. who knows. Just hope they don't make it a vault ornament when they do decide to tweak it. It's probably my favorite handcannon in all of destiny, only behind my Luna in D1
---
You can shoot through phalanx shields too
---
Tractor Cannon, Shotgun, OEM. He's not wrong.
---
Yes I just did it with the Crimson. Relatively easy .
---
As someone going for it, Iron Banner/3x Valor weekends are you friends. I got two resets this past 3x weekend just by playing Rumble, since you have to be in top 3 of 6 to count for a win. Full win streak nets you about 100 valor per match.

Niri always makes a [good infograph](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/ajr97v/eyes_up_guardians_here_are_x%C3%BBrs_wares_for_january/), and [u/ImpliedShrimpZ](https://www.reddit.com/user/ImpliedShrimpZ) posts it on here within a few minutes of Xur's appearance. 
---
In any gambit match literally days after it came out
---
They haven't said that he'll sell year 2 exotics. Just that there will be "Xur bounties" next season.
---
Nope. That gun takes some level of skill. I have respect for peeps that use chaperone and not the crotch rock blues!
---
Fighting lion. Bet
---
Yeah, I kinda wish they had an alternate quest to take or something else entirely. Maybe just make it "Someone on the team banks" One of the Malf quests lets you do it that way. The Bounties need to encourage playing to win. We all kind of have to be "that guy" now and again if we want to complete out bounties.
---
The Forsaken Legendary collection (runs about $60 normally, but Activision has it on sale on Amazon right now ($26.95 USD for PS4 version)) includes the base game, curse, warmind, and forsaken.
---
Once you hit 600 you can decide it you want the season pass (around $35.00 right now).  You would not be able to play that content until you hit that level anyway, so you don't need it now.
---
You can get your light up high enough to do do the activites quickly so you should not have a problem.
---
2 transits and a sparrow 
---
It's cool and all but I feel like I've seen a ton of these since Forsaken came out on this subreddit
---
When trying to keep someone interested in D2... I wouldn't recommend using this particular part of the game. Ever. 
---
'your lack of grammer' is hilarious, and had to be pointed out. was testing out SMG cuz i just got the gun. im going to keep using scout rifles cuz theyre the most fun. power ammo is not fun, but i do grab it occasionally to sword people.
---
Thanks man!
---
the matchmaking is too quick to kick for inactivity. 
---
Bet he got a nadelauncher
---
I need that Crimson
---
I thought it was commonly accepted that this rule holds true at the start of the round before people have supers/special ammo, but can be bent later in the game?
---
Meanwhile I'm over here without it smh. Regardless good for you man, here's to good rng
---
Dragonfly and rampage are the god rolls on this gun right? Or maybe kill clip instead. Either way I got the dragonfly rampage one to drop twice for me... And it took about 25 attempts to get feeding frenzy kill clip with accurized and stability masterwork on my blast furnace. Got my lmg with feeding frenzy rampage the other day and a range masterwork too. I'm a happy guardian :)
---
I got it first kn a no feelings, then on a threat level. At the time I had not used grave robber yet, and thought jt was a garbage perk. Was really tempted back then to shard it for the shader. I'm just glad that I didnt
---
i almost only play pvp games, destiny is one of the few games where i like the pve, which is why i was so disappointed that they didnt give a shit about their pvp. i usually play pve before sleep, but i tend to enjoy pvp &gt; pve (in most games). i generally, dont find trouble relaxing playing pvp but im sure shooters are most likely to be impacted by not giving your full attention. none of this is relevant to the shit game design that's gone into pvp, its like tubes in mw2
---
People will say that it’s not good, but I loved that thing for a while after I got it. If you read the description it wil fire double rounds after a kill. So kill an ad with the first burst and then you can fire double for the rest of the magazine....I believe it’s still viable and just fun. I liked running with it on my Titan with melting point. I’d kill an ad then melting point the boss and go to town. It also fucked people up in crucible with that crazy range. Just one of those exotics nobody uses anymore, but definitely fun when you first get it.
---
Not from giving seraphite. You have to open nodes to get a warmind schematic then turn that into ana
---
Exactly my train of thought :)
---
Damn now I feel so bad for responding all salty lol Coming from the film production world, it’s typically said as 1080, 2.5K, 4K, etc. so it just felt second nature to refer to 1440p as that
---
why they wouldnt be balanced separately is beyond me
---
I'm gonna start a second character today(I have a maxed out warlock). I eventually wanna have one of each. Honestly I'm leaning Titan but if the hunter exotic is good now then I'll do a hunter first. Any suggestions on which character to start based on today's exotic. 
---
Try completing it while polymerized would increase your chances. I got that shader from an armour drop.
---
Nice
---
Thanks
---
Story mission vs. adventure.
---
A puma you say?
---
I've made around 35 kindled orchids and they are all trash apart from two which are okay.
---
It’s all luck for me. Team wipes are pretty rare. Super + heavy + luck, maybe kill 3 or 4. If the team’s good, I get zero kills.
---
People are just too stupid to see a joke when it’s slaps them in face.
---
Like the other guy said, do it along side of the armor consumable. Took me one try and it dropped on the armor as well. 
---
Just got Jotunn last night, ready to do Shattered Throne and finish Izanagi's Burden and start on the Last Word!
---
Haha yeah it’s one of the few gambit bounties you can complete by just playing, and not having to be inefficient (I’m looking at you, large blocker bounty)
---
Heroic events are random though
---
Yeah took me a few seconds to find out
---
I'm getting bored with Destiny as well, but let's be honest, people complain about Destiny being incomplete on launch, but Anthem won't even have their PvP mode they're planning on launch, what a joke, the game looks trash and most of the gun play is just launching abilities that don't seem to require aiming and the bosses look simple and repetitive from what I've seen.
---
Di-.... Did you say the Last Word!?!?! Nani?

Synthoceps or you are not Titan. You are some mishmash of little man and peasant garbage.
---
Orpheus Rigs and Celestial GG
---
Thanks! I've been trying to save my resources so that I can upgrade the exotics I've found while leveling. You're saying it's better to turn everything in for shards?
---
As a base game player who’s Maine’s hunter since D1 I can say that this feature is absolute shit and has ruined my class but Jesus Christ am I gonna have fun when I get the Annual pass
---
That one hunter with tractor cannon.
---
This one came out with curse of Osiris and was that seasons exclusive emote I think ever since then it's not been obtainable.
---
Boy I really picked the best time to post this. All the cool fun guardians are browsing right now. 
---
I think it came from the moon
---
Yeah man it’s pretty solid MW with the range in PvP, also used it in PvE for a decent amount of time, if you have a good aim (headshots) it’s a fucking wrecking machine for adds with the health regen on kill and reload on precision. Absolutely outstanding gun, but using Midnight coup, ep sg and whisper now. 
---
Think I probably did better with crimson but it’s hard too tell.
---
Who cares this is for destiny2 content 
---
I wish they would
---
I played during the Osiris DLC but never got it
---
There’s no mode that isn’t sweaty.  And I mean OEM titans rushing constantly every game.
---
I gave it a shot in PvE and it's pretty good other than the fact that it can shred through ammo quickly if you're low on ammo. Haven't given it a chance at PvP yet but I will soon.
---
Post removed because it's not Destiny related content.
---
Also, don't be antagonistic. Why antagonize other communities for the sake of a laugh? 
---
Thanks ! 
---
gotta do what u gotta do. respect the hustle. 
---
Corner. Thermite. Shotgun. Wait for red to be near on radar and throw the Thermite. Either they're going to soloult you or you'll generally kill them pretty quick. Hallowfire with super up and paragons means a lot of skill uptime. I generally don't have issues turtling.
---
I’ve gotten 2 so far and they both had that exact same roll. Huge disappointment...
---
No, he isn't lol.
---
Post removed. Please keep topics Destiny related please.

Regardless of timing, you have violated several rules of this subreddit. Also, you appear to be violating [https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement#p\_37](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement#p_37) when you stated in your previous comment that you are under the age of 13. This has been reported and all relevant information given to reddit's moderation team.
---
If you're at a point where there are that many blockers, you're probably losing the match. Not saying blockers do much, but three medium or large blockers is a sign that your team isn't playing as a team.
---
No just a bunch of people that have played for years running around with shotguns 
---
I made a post about this a few weeks ago and was basically lambasted by everyone that responded. A couple other posts come up since then and people rejoice and agree unanimously.

Do you guys just change opinions every few days?

Its fucking amazing. I love chaining Nova Bombs, so satisfying!
---
That’s why I said that people should just wait for the Temporal thingy to bring it back for, what was it, 1000 Silver ? I’m perfectly fine with that
---
This. I’m Xbox as well or I’d run it with you. Bear in mind, Horror story and Thunderlord have no level caps so you can work a second or third character with maxed weapons right off the bat if you have them.

I’ve gotten this exact roll for the three times I’ve forged it.

Chaparone. The hitbox is huge and is very forgiving.

If you want a challenge however, give your Good Bone Structure a shot, (no pun intended) you might enjoy it.

You have got to be the most exciting person I have ever met. Thank you for reporting everything you did, it will make everything so much better as they learn you cannot or will not take a joke! Should I have included an /s at the end of my first comment? Should I upload a picture of one of my ID’s to prove to you I am in fact probably old enough to be your daddy? Should I find another person as FUN/s as you and hook you up together? My options seem LIMITLESS when I talk with you my dude. Have a good day!
---
Such a great looking AR.
---
It’s possible for 1 650 to solo it with under 580s as fireteam members. I know, because i did it. They had to throw all orbs, and I required they used tether on on who was a hunter, and banner shield on the other who was a titan. Had the boss done with 13 sleeper shots, 3 grenades, and my super.
---
big boi ball
---
That's sick I love seeing the drawings the community makes I follow kobeart and mal on Twitter 
---
Glad I could help, I hope you have a good day as well.
---
This ☝
---
&gt; Honestly, one of my biggest complaints about Destiny is that nothing is really explained in-game.
---
Yeah I just started playing and this has annoyed me to no end. I have a pretty limited amount of free time to game and I'd like to spend it actually playing the game rather than reading articles and watching youtube videos to learn how things work.
---
Ah, so you're right next door to D2 then.
---
There is not. I have heard that once you get one, you should stop opening nodes, because you're probably not going to get a second one within the same day. 
---
Okay, thank you
---
The soft cap didn't change with Black Armory. It might stay the same for Joker's Wild. 
---
Yes I know, I was mocking the blueberry and showing my mockiness!
---
I’m a hunter main trying to get my titan up. Unfortunately I don’t have the luck for exotics 
---
then why did you have no goddamn quotes around it?
---
You do realize they saying no right now cuz they have the better system. When it was ps3 and xbox 360 Microsoft was the one to say no to cross platform 
---
I'll tolerate your black ops 4 skin make sure regime skin for assualt rifle
---
I had the same thing happen to me earlier except we where the ones to lose. You don’t happen to play ps4 do you lol
---
Depends on your power level. I finished the Forsaken campaign and wasn’t high enough level yet for it.
---
This is yet another good reason why Bungie left Activision
---
How about you explain on these stupid posts how to turn it heroic instead of whining? 
---
Does that still work?
---
O quit sucking the cool aid out of Sony’s dick, the point stands that cross platform between Xbox and PlayStation would be good for everyone that plays games!
---
I had the same problem
---
Time for what else?  With a 50% increase you can then get a quick bounty for more gear (materials if you don't like the legendary drop and a core). It takes less time to do heroic then to do two, especially if everyone is in the circle as it speeds it up.
---
Epic
---
I am close to 600 so i will probably wait for the next reset get to 600 then buy the annual pass.
---
I'm not denying it I'm just saying that's what Microsoft gets when they said no the first time 
---
51 more headshots and it’s yours!!! You can do it!!! 
---
She did, about a year ago.
---
YouTube. Literally almost every Destiny YouTuber has made a tutorial about it. I’m not explaining it to someone who won’t listen 
---
That's the point of then rotating eververse items, showing your experience.
---
Any tips for those still trying? How did you deal with the toxic meta?
