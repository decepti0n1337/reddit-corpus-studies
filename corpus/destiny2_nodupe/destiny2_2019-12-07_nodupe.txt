Too bad
---
Well theres nothing sad about taking the time to view a profile it doesnt take 3 years to do so.
---

---
And here you are taking the time to scroll through pages of a game that is oh so trash.
---
Indeed. Although, I bought basic shadowkeep with same season situation. And not sure if I need to buy Dawn...
---
Looking on Steam etc. Can't see an option to buy it. Do I have all 3 seasons included!?
---
What's wrong with Mountain and Recluse?
---
But we just wanna come over to burrow some sugar :)
---
Agreed. 14 murdered so many vex that they even broke all of their own protocols to build a shrine and honor him. Shaxx is a beast but 14 is a legend.
---
Nice, not even close but nice.
---
I was at 968
---
Asher Mir in a beer?
---
Thanks man! I really appreciate it
---
Then gtfo, simple
---
Thanks
---
Cayde beat Shaxx in the crucible once but he cheated. Shaxx didn‚Äôt take it very well
---
I honestly can‚Äôt understand some people. Comparing the Destiny pass to Fortnite or COD, when in those games you‚Äôre paying for just the battle pass and in Destiny you‚Äôre getting Activities, Exotics, Quests, etc. Also the amount of time it takes to max the pass in those games are crazy compared to Destiny, don‚Äôt even get me started on that new COD battle pass. And complaining about spending $10 every 3 months? Just skip a trip to McDonalds...
---
You have to pay extra for that.
---
Damn.
---
I wonder/hope if we'll get S14's armor somehow.
---
r/suddenlywarframe
---
Mmkthen....
---
Totally agree. But then i wont be able to use izanagi
---
Ok ok, because I probably thought of after you deal with the three in the casino where you are returned to the Villa entrance, normally you would turn around and head to the Mojave but I did a little searching (mainly for screenshots) and got the attention of one
---
I‚Äôve never had an OEM t-bag me before but it‚Äôs always a hunter at the bottoms of the scoreboard.
---
Op: stoopid, I'm not going to let you get the chance!
---
It‚Äôs only *this* broken bc it‚Äôs momentum control
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇyou just made me feel 10x better lol like he still wasn‚Äôt on the top of the leaderboard , even after sweating so hard
---
Sure. I can get it back from collections
---
You realize this is momentum control right? This would literally never happen in any other playlist.
---
most GLs require a direct hit to kill in one hit, most rocket launchers en machine guns are much better in crucible imo
---
I really wanted one with field prep. But for the love of God i just can't get it  
---
I got the pulse monitor/full court on my second try. But cant get full court/field prep
---
You're right, it is the handheld supernova and not the mod
---
I wish some of the Titan grenades were less shit.
---
As far as I'm concerned there are only 2 good titan grenades
---
The pulse grenade for Arc
---
and the suppressor grenade _I guess_, I've never really gotten any usage out of it.
---
You suck long enough you'll always get some kinda reward lol
---
Just quit, you'll never make it
---
Sorry, I meant telesto, my brain is dumb sometimes
---
Ok boomer.
---
Save the turtles
---
He probably had a notorious invader set on
---
There‚Äôs everything sad about scrolling through a profile to find some relevant dirt for you to use. 
---
I don‚Äôt know where you get the idea that I scroll through this sub specifically because you‚Äôd be delusional if you do. I still follow the sub so ofc posts still show up in my feed. 
---
Also I don‚Äôt think the game is ‚Äòoh so trash‚Äô that‚Äôs you making shit up that I didn‚Äôt say. I stopped playing games that require excessive grinding completely because I realised how much of a waste of my time it is so now I stick to casual playing. 
---
Fucking zoomers.
---
Lol destiny 2 campaign and good story telling? I mean the lore is cool, but the campaign story telling is pretty weak.
---
There's a quest in lecturn. Reward is Love and Death. Try to get one with Field Prep, Full court, Spike grenade and blast radius masterwork
---
That would mean Forsaken never happened, which would make the game about 10x worse.
---
Titans are for men
---
Lesson learned
---
noice.
---
Do you wendigo gl 3 quest its easy and thing is beast
---
I got that medal for murdering everything in my path before they could touch me as n arcstrider.
---
Fun times
---
r/warlocksriseup
---
I believe it‚Äôs because explosive payload gives decrease precision damage.
---
I really wish they made ornaments for the Vex Offensive weapons.  Doesn‚Äôt matter what shader I put on them, they all look ugly to me.
---
I got it and randomly held on to it and then heard someone on Reddit call my exact drop a God roll.
---
Apparently your teammates are getting killed way too often without killing anything.
---
How in the fuck are you out of the map, I need to know!
---
Not sure if you meant to come off the way you did. But this game is great on console, and sure things may be different, both versions hold your hand in different ways, and through and through the games are the same thing.
---
The things that are good on console lean towards what hold your hand the most, (from what I‚Äôve experience) the ‚Äúmeta‚Äù on PC is more statistical. That doesn‚Äôt mean those statistically superior guns aren‚Äôt good on console, they just more difficult to use and less popular. 
---
Just my two cents into the topic.
---
I can relate so hard to this post take my upvote!
---
do you seriously not see anything wrong with using mt. cheese and spider smg?
---
Lol right! I feel like a dirtbag. Sometimes if I‚Äôm feeling really nice I‚Äôll send a msg saying sorry lol.
---
I spit on your staff
---
BONELESS GUARDIAN
---
I have an idea Shaxx soundboard that‚Äôs linked with buttons that drop treats for whatever pet you may own! Make sure there‚Äôs a cool down or you gonna be being lots of treats for fluffy! Just think about it every 5 minutes ‚Äú**I WISH ALL MY RECRUITS WERE LIKE YOU**‚Äù
---
Yea , that‚Äôs what I thought ...I just wanted to be sure before I said it‚Äôs still pretty OP lol
---
One... More... Game!
---
If an exotic let shoulder charge crit that make the one two punch perk happy
---
Nope.
---
Ok thanks cause I was doing pretty well that game was confused how we were still losing
---
Orb
---
If Bungie just makes him die again to tell us "You can't save everyone!!!" (as if Forsaken didn't teach us that already) after treating him like shit in CoO I will probably throw a table.
---
We have enough lore legends dropping like flies off-screen, at least let us keep Saint-14 ffs.
---
Warlocks are the battlefield medic
---
What perks are you using? Also assuming it‚Äôs masterworked. (Catalyst‚Äôd) whatever.
---
Foetracer does allow wallhacks in addition to truesight if it‚Äôs not procc‚Äôd, but OP isn‚Äôt using foetracer in this clip. Just a suggestion to people who like this setup in MC, best exotic for the playlist IMO.
---
Yep
---
They also allow you to do a bit of slip damage through shields before breaking them and let you ignore hydra shields altogether.
---
Halfway through when everyone started just pouring in the door I said to myself "son of a gun he's gonna get a seventh column".
---
Are you me?
---
Did it get a buff???
---
my heart goes out to you, my friend
---
Awesome!!! This is going on my phone
---
The next day\*
---
sure, hunters invi is hard to counter but theyre grinding for randys and i would do the same. id be infuriated but remember u can do it too. its either accept it or get them first and be better by being superior.
---
and i repeat "u do u"
---
It be like that sometimes
---
Same place as the new tower when you look down where it should be from the old tower in outbreak perfected.... the land of not programmed
---
In D1 I was a titan and in D2 I'm a hunter but recently as of the New Season updates, i have all 3
---
Needs to be nerfed ASAP.
---
Finishing the campaign if you haven't yet is a good place to start. 
---
Adventures will go away when you do them, but then when a planet is the flashpoint for the week adventures will come back that help complete the percentages for the point.
---
Random chance, not sure if it has to be heroic or not.
---
It's literally a stat in game that you can boost. It's a hidden number but you can make weapons have MORE bullet magnetism. Bungie just calls it "target acquisition"
---
No joke, I actually liked Cayde a lot when I first got into Destiny. I like most characters tbh, but Cayde was cute and funny so I enjoyed him a lot.
---
Then I discovered his fanbase. Now I can't even hear or read his name without eye-twitching. It's a wonder how it's often the sweet characters who have the most vile, aggressive fans. 
---
Whatever, at least it gives me the pleasure of telling Cayde fans that he would hate their behavior.
---
Foetracer is great, but so is graviton forfeit since it increases the invis and possibly walls hack duration
---
At least an ornament for red nessus leaves would have been great.
---
Up voting just cuz you said league.
---
Much skill üëçüëçüòÅüòÅ
---
I really wish Bungie would allow us to go into strike playlists with only our fireteam and no matchmaking.
---
You are a person of culture for using Coldheart. I use it almost every game, you are a legend for using it.
---
I mean, don't peak the fucking lane xD "hmm, I just watched four dudes get bipped when they poked their heads out from behind this wall. Im sure it will be fine when I do it though! Slide out at least? Lol nah, rather cry like a baby and be salty"
---
It won‚Äôt make you better at the game tho...
---
I understand that, I went the hard way before this mode was out and crafted a scout rifle build with sanguine alchemy.
---
Also shaders on exotic weapons...
---
I lost a brain cell reading that last part
---
lol what the hell
---
That point doesn‚Äôt reach 100, so I‚Äôm still not entirely convinced it happened
---
ah yes jotunn
---
I love that fact that Ikora is canonically the only person to beat Shaxx in crucible to date.
---
* clears throat *...
---
*Warlock*
---
Oh I get the point you're making now! 
---
Rose = Normal. 
---
Thorn = Dark.  
---
Lumina = Light. 
---
And then EV base = Normal ( or Light seeing as how it was crafted). 
---
EV with the Catalyst = Normal+ or Light+ depending on how you see the original gun. 
---
The + being the point I was trying to make. I was distinguishing it as a "new gun" similar to Lumina or Thorn.
---
How do you even get the catalyst in the first place?
---
Trying to dodge.. it's a double tap B and if it hasn't recharged then the crouch accidentally
---
You complete activities with EV equipped.
---
I just don't like having to redo the campaigns n everything :/
---
Second post here, can new light players get vigil of heros (hunter) armor? I do not see it as a reward from faction engram.
---
Every one keeps saying it's only Jade. No, it's ANY 150 RPM scout. It's ALSO Aggressive Frame Pulses that can one tap.
---
Spectral blades sure, but I haven‚Äôt seen anyone crouch shooting for invis on the way to legend 
---
Top comp players seem to be highly mobile instead of campy
---
I like the shape of the titan helmet for the look I was trying to get, but the two parts of the helmet made it look way too skinny. That or my shoulders were too big.
---
Yup!
---
As a warlock main I wanna see osiris pleeeeeaasee I'm begging (ikora is cool but not osiris cool lol)
---
At least it‚Äôs just the one mode unlike everything else with oem titans face rolling their way around the map
---
No offense meant here, but one anecdote doesn't constitute high level comp as a whole. People use it to varying degrees of success
---
Why are you downvoting him, he‚Äôs right !!
---
Amazing work drawling one for the titans. *salutes*
---
Mmmmmm delicious crayon make titans strooonker!!!!!
---
Heroic menagerie
---
Damn right it did. And I love them both!
---
Thornaments
---
I should mention that I play on PC, where LH and NF are less meta :/, I just want the rush of knowing people will see the "not forgotten" in the killed by. I agree that the best primary is a shotgun though lol, congrats my dude!
---
The wisper of the truth
---
Didn‚Äôt realize this was destiny sub, it was on my home page, assumed it was COD or PUBG. So yes I was lost
---
If you read the latest lore post thing, Osiris, Sagira, and the Drifter discuss how dangerous the Sundial is, and that Osiris had to make a dangerous bargain to get it to work
---
That would be correct, yes. But there are specific planet xp perks along with strikes and crucible xp perks
---
Someone didn‚Äôt proof read
---
LEAVE ME ALONE DAMNIT
---
You're correct but people on this sub don't allow critical feedback
---
Haven't played in months, how are you killing them with one headshot?
---
Iirc the 5 resets step is retroactive.
---
Yes, COD, Halo, any shooter I play I turn it off. Didn‚Äôt realize this was on Destiny sub, so obviously not on here as there‚Äôs no option.
---
###WHY IS IT ALWAYS YOU
---
Yeah that was my bad, didn‚Äôt know it was destiny sub, just saw this on my home page, figured it was COD or something
---
Cuz
---
BUT WHAT ABOUT PRAEDYTH I want my dad
---
I love my little pillager, got an outlaw kill clip today. Keep it up, ive gotten 2 in all of destiny 2. Its out there
---
Yeah, only on PUBG tho, you need two desks in an L shape for controlling that recoil
---
This is the real problem with modern warfare at the moment. The aim assist on console is so strong that you literally don‚Äôt have to touch anything to track someone running across the screen
---
Idk what modes you're playing, but they aren't super effective the way OEM is against competent opponents.
---
That like 80% of my comp matches bungie thinks I can carry anything but I'm really not that good
---
I noticed I got it to drop more playing regular Gambit. Maybe that‚Äôs a thing but I could be wrong
---
Imagine people still playing non solar classes after buff
---
I was waiting for you to get out a restaurant menu and start reading it to the knight. 
---
I‚Äôm not a smart man
---
Idk either I‚Äôm just stating facts
---
Yes, because all of us who don't have consoles and want to play destiny are assholes
---
What do you mean?
---
It‚Äôs a perk on middle tree nightstalker
---
Like, I'm not complaining, but why
---
To be fair, that stapler sound was basically THE good weapon for all of D2Y1
---
I think from what I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs the lack of new PvP content, especially doesn‚Äôt help when bungie said something about a ‚Äúrenewed focus on PvP‚Äù
---
Too bad you made this meme for the wrong game, destiny doesnt have cross play. If you were cool, you would have made this meme for modern warfare.
---
I‚Äôve only had 2 Bygones drop. The rest has been all scouts, snipers and Pillagers
---
Osiris got kicked out because he was too much of a Vex nerd
---
Toland had a similar situation but hive
---
Felwinter was a fucking hitman
---
Because, video games
---
Nice
---
You‚Äôll also want Actium War Rig if you want to keep the bullets flying. It‚Äôs an absolute meme once you get the hang of it. :D
---
Sorry i have to disagree. With the new changes you can strategize with sunbracers in pve like so:
---
Cosume grenade and get airborne and use your melee ranged attack to get a kill, activating sunbracers giving you about 5 grenades over 5 seconds. Youre gonna kill quite a few heads which will recharge your melee and chances are youll have your grenade back up from the last nanosecond of sunbracers. 
---
You can either repeat or stay on the ground and pop a rift.
---
Abilities while in the air and weapons on the ground. 
---
Ps. Obvsiously use your weapons in the air aswell i didnt mean to seperate the two so literally
---
I don‚Äôt think being an adult with a career has any bearing on not being arrogant. 
---
Hell in my experience the most arrogant players are grown men with careers who think they are better than you for that fact alone. Especially when you beat someone in PvP and they give you all the reasons why their life is so busy and awesome that means they don‚Äôt have time to practice. And so somehow you beating them is a moral victory for them.
---
Sorry, bit of a rant XD
---
Thank you
---
:P
---
That was sold during the Halloween event and only during that even
---
WELCOME TO THE UNITED STATES OF SMASH!! WHERE YOU FLYIN?? ANYWHERE YOU WANT WITH CODE OF THE HOLY ICBM YEEEEEEHAW!!
---
Sweeper is actually a badass if you read the lore.
---
Lucky bastard
---
Seriously? You find it hard to believe on a home page of someone following around 50+ subs that I missed this being the one sub of a game with mandatory aim assist? I bet you‚Äôre real fun
---
Thank u for the kind words I'm trying in Gambit Prime now, I got a cool shotgun but still no pilly :(
---
Are you talking about when you take the mouse off the desk or when you plug in a controller?
---
I am now trying in Prime!
---
Sure you can't spare a few for a poor fool?
---
You most be very popular with the girls because you are One in a million
---
There‚Äôs the blenders in Pit of Heresy
---
Exactly man. I only started playing at the beginning of season of undying and i am PUMPED to see my first new season.
---
*laughs in Synthoceps*
---
That‚Äôs just snipers in general. 
---
If you get a one-shot-kill on someone, the bullet basically bounces off and will collateral a person who is close enough behind them - they don‚Äôt even have to be directly in a line. It‚Äôs hilarious in Momentum because you will body shot collat constantly.
---
That‚Äôs so fucking aids
---
Shouldve been a Vez and Saint-14.
---
But this works as well
---
I enjoy titan fall and will be picking up titan fall 2
---
I never use shotguns, I just realized I had that ornament for the chaperone and wanted to try it out.
---
He used the sun dial
---
You did?! No way?!
---
Hunters (will) have throwing knives, Titans have shoulder charge, now tell me, what does a warlock have?
---
Titan bad hunter good
---
Flawless Execution procs on any precision kill, so people that are skilled snipers proc it just as quickly in other forms of PvP. Nice strawman you got there with the Nova comparison.
---
Yeah i play on Xbox but it‚Äôs free right now on ps+ so the player count skyrocketed to numbers better than the initial launch
---
Pretty cool ^^
---
Ehh not like we all haven't done that a time or two.
---
Some things can be explained by looking at the gear in question more closely. Something to remember next time.
---
The way i see it is if during personal gameplay, the new ranged melee is up to scratch and does the damage then were laughing. 
---
I tend to lock in favourite exotics that synergize with my subclass (orpheus rig nightstalker, doomfang sentinel etc) so apologies for assuming you would aswell üòÇ
---
But jus wanted to give you a viable option where it could deffo work. 
---
However im not looking forward to not being able to jump kill with a passive heat rises
---
I appreciate your kindness nonetheless
---
Yes but like I said earlier you need a guide to follow the intended flow cause the ingame tracker doesn't do much of anything for it anymore. They literally could've just kept it the same as before and nobody would have had to miss out on the storyline progression.
---
Not really, no. All I've been doing to see if I could get it is do Menagierie runs and binge Gambit  
---
  
---
'tleast got the Calus Mini Tool
---
Pretty good first experience, I see.
---
They are so fucking predictable it‚Äôs almost sad. Hope these 12 year old hunter mains figure out why they are stuck at sub 1000 glory one day.
---
You don‚Äôt need to fully charge up to kill non supers but still very nice.
---
Most players are Hunters
---
Gg
---
LOL DUDE delete this and repost cause that is a terrible job covering his name xD
---
Me:Imma farm that Kulve Taroth all day.
---
CHOPPIN BRICKS LIKE KARATE
---
Such an ugly set
---
It only happens if you do enough damage to break off his head, but not enough to kill.
---
Nice work
---
Next time try to win the Match
---
Lol
---
[deleted]
---
With a shoulder charge and peregrine greaves.
---
They won't, and they never will. The blame will just shift to how their new throwing knife toy has bad hit detection, and how Hunter dodge shouldn't have a cooldown. Anything to buff their class and cripple the other two. It's fucking pathetic
---
Peregrine greaves maybe?
---
Same such a wasted space
---
Then what‚Äôs his name? smileW
---
They can one shot through ward of dawn? DAMNNNNNNN
---
rghernandez311
---
They can one shot a bubble titan?
---
Yes, when DLC comes out it‚Äôs popular for a week and then dies down again, don‚Äôt deny it. Every time I check twitch, the most viewed streamer has 500-700 views. If the game has ‚Äúhigh numbers‚Äù why is it not popular on twitch? Popular streamers don‚Äôt count. I‚Äôm talking about the average streamers. And please don‚Äôt say, ‚ÄúOh well that‚Äôs just twitch, that means nothing, look at how many people play daily‚Äù. If it was truly a popular game, it would have more views. I have a ton of people on my friends list that play Destiny, and 5/50ish of them play consistently still, and I‚Äôm telling the truth. 
---
People who disagree are obviously die hard  bias Destiny fans, and I understand. But please be real here.
---
Hammer strike is a one hit melee, and the bubble only stops damage from outside, you can still be killed inside the bubble if an enemy comes into it since it's not like D1 bubble.
---
Looks like a peregrine greaves shoulder charge. It can kill people in supers so you were pretty much toast as soon as he got into range.
---
A proof that the Traveler has been a historical feature in Asian culture.
---
Gfx‚Äôer
---
Yep I main Titan aswell and only play it to be overpowered in pvp. I get it.
---
A scrub on a sub
---
You must not own the weapon, paid for the recovery or just half assed the grind. It is precision kills plus 300 kills right? Over half of mine were precision and also done in comp. I don‚Äôt play passive anything that shit is boring so I ran a beloved and sweet business most of the time I dint think that is passive . Of course Revoker is my standard it is the only sniper grind we have. What can compare
---
hey man
---
Hawthorne would probably fit in too
---
Book it, they will.
---
Until you pick up more ammo.
---
Knives are the most elegant weapon you can get a kill with.
---
Yeah, and Hunter doesn't really have this damage increasing super like for raids. But it's not really practical, at least in my experience for others. The damage boost is insignificant, it's better to use for ads anyway and yeah, hunters are bad at survivability. I'd even say worst. Meanwhile titan bubble + warlock well means you will 1 phase a boss.
---
Heart of inmost light + middle tree void + oppressive darkness is no doubt one of the best and most fun PVE builds of d2
---
I'd wager at least 50% of the commenters here don't even realize crouching takes you off of radar momentarily
---
She used to be the one for Sturm but idk about that since I did sturm all 3 times back in year one
---
It glitched, Rose changed to Lumina, and now it's shown as equipped even though the game knows better.
---
A similar glitch was possible Pre-Shadowkeep, where if you had a weapon that required a higher Player Level, you could infuse a weapon into it and it would be "equipped" but since you aren't that level, it's unusable.
---
Being invisible takes you off the radar entirely unless you sprint. It can be very good for flanks.
---
Shadowkeep isn't necessary for decent PvP gear, most meta gear is from pre shadowkeep.
---
My favourite version of this is with taken psions. I cant stop thinking about it whenever I see them split and it cracks me up
---
She cameos in the Sturm and Thorn questlines.  Those two plus Zero Hour are the only times I've gone back to the Farm since I played through Red War.
---
The best defence against apes, be it shotgun or recluse, is backpedaling in my experience.  You need at least some ability at 'reading' your opponent, but when you know they're coming putting that extra distance between you is key.  Speaking for myself, I find Cerberus and Regime are very strong at shutting down a charging shotty ape because they don't make it hard to shoot them with their pro "hold down W" strat.
---
And is forsaken now free for f2p players?
---
Woah how
---
Killing »òedia quick like that is doing the lords work. If I weren't a glimmer poor Guardian I'd gild you
---
I go just to visit and run around it‚Äôs a pretty location but still sad it‚Äôs never used at all
---
No, you need to purchase Forsaken but the Annual Pass (black armoury, jokers wild, and opulance) is now included with Forsaken.
---
Why did you get so mad? I have all of the pinnacles as none of them are hard to obtain in my opinion. You mentioned that if sniping was easy, everyone would have a Revoker. Maybe nobody uses it because Revoker isn't even a top 5 sniper in this meta?
---
Also, I never said YOU were passive, I mentioned one can easily obtain the weapon by hard scoping lanes. Next time read my comment before making some ridiculous claim about my ability to acquire an easily acquired weapon.
---
That‚Äôs because u clearly lack in skill in normal play and have u us a op weapon to make yourself feel good good job mate
---
Rule 12
---
If i buy shadowkeep? Is that include forsaken?
---
Nope forsaken and shadowkeep need to be purchased separately.
---
It a one tap head shot mate across the map
---
OEM is only good for Titans that play like Hunters.
---
Let's go back to our roots and wear skullfort, like the proud shoulder-chargers we are.
---
Wasn't nerfed enough.
---
Graphic design is my passion
---
Curse you bungie! Ty for replies!!
---
yeah, wish I knew that a month ago :p
---
This.  I'm actually curious though what the next target of mass complaining is going to be though.  My money is on Peregrine Greaves.
---
We don‚Äôt deserve you either
---
Strange that Dawn is not yet available to purchase anywhere individually so close to release.
---
Satisfying to watch but dude it‚Äôs cheap, scummy, and downright pathetic at times in this game mode...
---
Everyone's all 'oh look at Ikora, building a vex portal in the tower'
---
I'm just sitting here going 'I want them to come through, take a good hard look at who's standing on the other and just leave. Like just turn their entire bodies and just walk backwards while looking at ikora.'
---
Sure you do. You just don't think you do.
---
There are two ways to "git gud" at crucible. As someone who plays lots of it I can tell you that you will get crushed if you are not doing one of these two things. 
---
Option 1 (EZ mode): Slap on a shotgun, run bottom tree striker titan and sprint around. Find someone, slide near them, fire a shot and then instantly melee no matter what. 9/10 they will die to the melee and the other 1/10 times the shotgun shell. You will at least go 1:1 like this and not be a hindrance to the team. 
---
Option 2 ( the other way to win): Get a weapon with a good time to kill (last word or any other hand cannon really) and just focus on getting head shots. This part is key, you need to focus on nothing else but landing every shot. Don't think about crouching or dodging, don't think about if someone is shooting at you or near you. Let your mind go blank to everything but landing those 3 shots on the head of the guy you are aiming at.
---
Once you master this "going zen" you suddenly win well over 50% of your 1 v 1's just because the other guy isn't as focused and will miss a shot. 
---
This is also how you can sometimes use non meta weapons like auto's and crush in low ranked games. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
You will still lose to sweat lords running LoW and MTR those guys with snipers for whom flinch is just a 6 letter word but you will start to see drastic improvements. Just pick one of these approaches and practice it.
---
Real quick... That's pretty dope. Question, isn't the game normally played to 150? Or is it 200 bc its the equivalent of a kilometer kill? Idk man Americas kinda behind on the whole numbers game. I'm also feeling dumber and dumber as I type this. Its prolly time for bed.
---
Wha?  Synthoceps, Skullfort, Peregrine, Dunemarchers, and War Rig are fantastic in PvP
---
With a sword. His sword. Right on up there.
---
*HEREEEEEEEEEEEEEE‚ÄôS TITAN
---
My bad
---
That's why they call him Queen's breaker.
---
Probably, but there chance is so low its not worth doing it if your goal is to get the weapons.
---
Before Shadowkeep it was common knowledge to get above 100k for the best chances to get the weapons to drop.
---
This hurt me emotionally lmaoo
---
I find it ridiculous, we dont need that on mouse and keyboard. I understand perfectly why its a thing on console, but bullet magnetism just takes the satisfaction out of the good shot i just made. I wish i could just turn it off on pc
---
Let me not deserve you dammit!!!!!!!
---
Just got exit strat and randy's this week for the undying title. I don't think I'm ever going to chase for another title again. The grind is soul-draining.
---
I‚Äôm seriously boutta just start replying to people on that sub with advertisements for blood pressure medication. They legit think they‚Äôre making the world a better place by being mad at a video game THAT THEY CONTINUE TO PLAY AND PAY FOR.
---
This is dope
---
I have no idea
---
Right
---
It's cool thanks for taking time to read and reply though
---
Yep that 100% peg greaves, you can pause to look. And fyi  on air melee can 1 shot kill a barrier chaampion so yep u ded
---
I want to get some of the pinnacle weapons but I can't get them at all
---
I got mine from a spider bounty about 2 weeks ago. I don‚Äôt know if anything has changed since then.
---
What?
---
If you look at the names on the nightmare hunts you can  see what essens you can get
---
*Ninja nods in approval*
---
I have. It's not one of them. It's for the sword.
---
I have no memory of this place...
---
Oh my Traveler...he is...HE IS BEAUTIFUL. Magnificent job, your art skills are amazing!
---
What is your light level?
---
Happened to me once
---
I genuinely hate the aim assist on console. I‚Äôll be lining up for a nice snipe, then someone will run perpendicular to me dragging the scope with them
---
So salty lmao
---
I need more information and effort from the poster in order to make significant disappointment when this post only gets backed because of Pewdie sheep.
---
Issa fact !! That‚Äôs the best to ever eat crayons right there ‚úäüèΩüíú
---
Yeah I'm really proud of them, they're pretty cheap and simple, if you want I can pm you the "recipe".
---
How did u get invisibility after every kill and how did u get the targets highlighted?
---
What's hilariously ironic here is that the guy probably just made a joke, while you are the one that actually did the exact thing you just verbally shat on the guy for...
---
I see mostly warlocks in this vid...
---
Titanfall 1 was so much better than 2 for me. The lowered TTK in 2 led to air movement and wallrunnimg being less viable than before and severely limiting your movement in comparison.
---
When you find that one Hunter who complained so much that they got you nerfed
---
Holy mother of details!
---
*Marked for Vengeance*
---
Mad lad
---
That is amazing and I can‚Äôt wait to see it finished.
---
Specifically the MoT one at end of D1.
---
Then play with him you monster
---
Nothing that's specifically good for hunters.
---
Ahh okay, thanks mate
---
Even more helpful finding an invader. Wish Ender doesn‚Äôt get the love anymore
---
Pray he doesn't alter it further
---
Fuck the guy for calling u out in the first place.
---
I find hunters more often than not more useless. But I also hate the hunter class in general both in PvE and PvP. Their whole way of playing is based upon being a coward.
---
Hunter: oh a made a position mistake I'm just gonna go invis!
---
Meanwhile every other class either thinks and doesn't make that mistake in the first place or fights their way out of the situation.
---
Hive, Bring a sword!
---
I shoot my MIDA with a MIDI for maximum sinergy.
---
&gt; they just need to make footsteps more audible.
---
No radar PvP in D2 would make sense if sound design wasn't all over the place. People legitimately sneak up on me (melee kills) even when I have headphones on. It's atrocious.
---
Blame who ever is doing those pictures of guns as pinups
---
Only the Single knife or the 3 knifes also?
---
Have you been doing the Machine Gun Frame from Ada-1 until the point where it tells you to go complete a forge? Can't access forges or Black Armory bounties before that.
---
Isn't there a quest to unlock all the forges?
---
What is the lore concerning the sweeper bot?
---
I‚Äôm glad that it finally can keep it, it‚Äôs such a great looking exotic
---
I usually go into Team chat and ask if people are doing bounties so I can back off. For my own I go solo normal NF and just leave to Orbit to swap load outs.
---
The new season artifact will have the same types of mods, but the weapon types they can be applied to will change and as for the elemental mods instead of focusing on void and arc elements they will focus on void and solar.
---
‚ÄúI hate titans who use shoulder charge.‚Äù
---
‚ÄúI hate Warlocks who use handheld supernova.‚Äù
---
How‚Äôs it different?
---
Thank God. I hate the idea of permanent exclusivity for exotics. I hope Leviathans Breath is staying forever as well, my brother really wants it but couldn't get the season pass (and doesn't have his own Xbox).
---
Repost? Fine. Intentionally crop out the credits and then not name the artist? You're a scumbag.
---
Well, after 69 kids I guess you got tired of each other huh?
---
Not saying every PC player is a PC elitist.
---
This needs to hang on my wall with my sentinel shield replica with purple LED.
---
Backlore: 
---
I stopped playing Destiny 2 sometimes around the time Forsaken was released due to my PC giving up on me and now I have only a laptop that gives me 20 fps on low in destiny, and it kind of ruins the fun. I don't want to buy a new pc just yet, because i am saving up for something really special this time.
---
My question:
---
Can Destiny 1 still be played? Which parts of Destiny 2 cannot be played anymore at all because of expansions and updates? 
---
I am asking this, because I will probably get my new rig sometimes mid next year, and I would love to (if Destiny 3 is on the horizon), to play through everything Destiny 1 &amp; 2 related, and start Destiny 3 on release.
---
No, I will try that, thank you
---
I only meant my comment towards elitist, not chill PC players.
---
99.999% of us do too.
---
I'm not sure yet
---
What the balls?
---
Someday you will find me, when you see my corpse fly
---
Cause a handheld supernova made me die
---
Titans can abuse the meta, I‚Äôm a titan main myself. But I don‚Äôt abuse the meta because it gets boring after a while. OEM, took it off and never touched it again after only 4 matches after discovering it in a strike. Recluse, used it for 5 matches, discovered that it was getting nerfed and placed it in my vault. Mountaintop, got it, used it for one game and placed it in my vault. I‚Äôm one of those titans, I don‚Äôt recklessly give myself victory, I have to earn it.
---
If thats true there may be a reason to play again.
---
Titan: Hmmm there‚Äôs a shield here that I can‚Äôt shoot through. No other option, must punch.
---
You seem to have miss the construct of what was being discussed. Thanks for trying to participate though!
---
I hope you step on a lego barefoot for every person you killed with that üòÇüíÄ
---
But seriously good shit !! That‚Äôs what they get for rushing &amp; trying to melee you , when they knew you had a fusion rifle
---
Lol and this is why people pre shoot around corners. 
---
My bf is like why! I'm like cause you can see them in the hud...they can see you...
---
That scarification looks nice
---
No your using a fusion.
---
Heyo fairly new and uhhh are you taking applications for your clan
---
there was never any other option to begin with
---
Me likes
---
I sherpa raids and those guys get kicked after one warning, not trying to hear that noise.
---
that is the correct way to grind the medals
---
Yup, no exotics from main quest
---
A significantly larger portion of the Eververse content will be available for bright dust and they will inform you which won't be.
---
Major changes to a few solar subclasses, minor changes to other stuff
---
OEM and Recluse nerfs
---
Anarchy droprate doubled
---
No more duplicate exotic weapons ever again
---
Are you on Xbox? I can help xDEADB4UMOVE
---
Great, a karma account. Literally created yesterday, with 0 comments, and 2 posts with stolen content that have the artists and creators information cropped off.
---
OP, you can suck the fattest part of my micro penis. I hope you choke on it.
---
No way you can do that. That‚Äôs insane
---
Yes
---
I mean they are a independent studio
---
Top tree in the void subclass gives you the enhanced radar. As well as Invisibility with Dodging
---
I'm on PC, but thank you for offering :)
---
The crucible is hands down my favorite part of the game, despite the bullshit.
---
I'm kind of scared when he gets back he's going to ask for his helmet back.
---
You have the best username I've ever seen. Cheers.
---
I feel like that Titan is busting out a whiter Sharingan.  Could be the Naruto fan in me though!
---
They have hinted that instead of destiny 3, they will just continue updating the this current game and eventually it will just be called ‚ÄúDestiny‚Äù again. Similar to how World of Warcraft has been the same game for over 10 years and they just keep updating it. Yes Destiny 1 can still be played, it‚Äôs available on Xbox and PlayStation.
---
But saint 14 has the respect to not use OEM.
---
Heeeere's 14!
---
Yes it does, bullet magnetism still is in effect
---
its the snowfox from subnautica
---
PoE is a totally free to play game right? So expensive cosmetics for them makes sense, as that's the majority of their income. Destiny 2 has a tonne of paid content so the pricing on cosmetics is a bit overturned in my opinion.
---
Tell that to my Fireteam, they don't die to the boss they fall out of the map
---
How do you die to Argos?
---
This comment is too real lol.
---
I‚Äôm not insulting anyone it‚Äôs a joke man. Just chill out
---
Yeah that is their main way of making money. Other than getting paid by tencent. And destiny 2 is free now as well. With the dlcs getting 40% and 25% off as much as they have been it really isn‚Äôt that bad, and you don‚Äôt even need the dlcs to have fun with the game.
---
Happy cake day .
---
"I haven't played the game in a year and I got killed by someone that has!? FUCKING SWEATLORDS REEEEEEEE"
---
Didn‚Äôt really play it. So I wasn‚Äôt familiar until I looked it up.
---
As a warlock main I feel personally attacked, and can't help but ask bingo when it's going to be warlocks turn to be OP.
---
It would look badass- if it didn't have a bright red nipple on the top.
---
It looks like an old sock, and probably smells like one considering the amount of people who never take it off *and* sweat heavily when they use it.
---
snowfox came out with below zero... and not long after destiny created that sparrow
---
Why I sided with the Vanguard:
---
I do not trust Zavala's leadership. His decisions have gotten many guardians killed, and his arrogance at our superiority has led him to misjudge potential threats. Cayde (RIP), while always someone you could count on, was far too impetuous for his own good. And Ikora. The more level headed of the three, she still had her flaws. Like her unwillingness to trust, as evidenced by her hidden agents keeping watch over just about everyone. 
---
That being said, the three of them shared an unyielding desire to protect the innocent at all costs. No matter what it took, no matter how difficult the task, they never shied away from doing all that was necessary to protect others. Zavala did not hesitate to rush in without his light so that we could get our shot at taking down Dominus Ghaul, Cayde didn't hesitate to start figuring out how to get past their defenses using Vex tech, and Ikora did not hesitate to rejoin them both so that she could aid them in figuring out how to make it all work.
---
I mean, you can haha one of my clanmates uses it as a profile picture on discord
---
Yea lol you guys need some buffs 2 im jus trolling
---
Eat them for a +3 bonus in whatever gambit armor stat it is or use them in reckoning to get gambit prime armor.
---
Play a lot, especially multiplayer. From 900 to up is harder to increase the power level. I m same level as u and that s how i leveled up
---
He‚Äôs the glowing light in patrols
---
That is why i'm still advocating for OEM to halve your FoV when you use it.
---
....and that's why I don't touch that game mode.
---
Bungie already stated all bounties will auto turn in before reset.
---
What shader did you use for your armor?
---
Is the Sundial going to be Menagerie style though?
---
I have seen nothing related to the coming season yet, but it seems like every is anticipating another Vex Offensive style event. I've only done the Menagerie a few times, but it's really cool and I really enjoy leveling up my chalice atm so I can pick my loot.
---
So true. I found a group of friends through a mutual friend... now the group has expanded to about 12 of us who routinely play. Always a group to do stuff. Best guys ever.
---
Eh. It looks to me more like other sparrows more than the braytech. Personally at least. But I guess I can see a resemblance.
---
It slows down a lot. You can only get prime engrams (they drop randomly now from enemies or crucible matches) and powerful rewards from the weekly challenges. If you play a lot, you can get from 900-950 in a weekend. It isn't hard, it just takes a lot of time. You can keep doing whatever you've been doing up to this point.
---
I don't remember, but if it was then there was zero reason to have the pass then.
---
Spray paint, old sheets, and one left big-toe. 
---
Looks great man! Do you have anything else you plan on making?
---
Lol what was that
---
I've survived worse
---
Hell yeah!
---
#indeed
---
I apologize to every teammate I‚Äôve ever killed with my sparrow. I also apoligize to every teammate I will do it to in the future because it‚Äôs just too fun
---
Shrouded Stripes. Had to of played forsaken before October 16th 2018. It was part of that whole bundle thing they had.
---
That first quest tho lol ‚ÄúMisplaced Trust‚Äù
---
played titan around 250 hours and never used oem because i didn't have it. syntoceps literally better choice for titans. hitting an enemy from 8 meters with melee matters a lot. I play hunter these days and oems not a problem for me actually. people rush like a child and rely on oem but 1 shotgun bullet will kill you anyway. so oem not really op for me.
---
Free legendary shards though.
---
Yeah when I had noticed that it killed me. It‚Äôs like bungie knew I betrayed him.
---
Not sure since I finished a long time ago but you have might have to do a few of either spiders quest to unlock it or petras or maybe even the wanted bounties. I did all of those before starting. The quest should say something about a legendary machine gun frame quest. If this doesn‚Äôt help I am afraid you have to resort to google.
---
Grats, i did my first last night as well, got real lucky with the ascendant shard...but I‚Äôd still rather have duty bound tbh.
---
Forsaken has overall more content but all the new stuff they are doing is for shadowkeep. So do you want more older content or newer content that everyone is doing?
---
I have the quest. All I have to do is get a weapon core for the black armory machine gun frame
---
I never said that it was more important than life. I‚Äôm just saying that I miss a group of friends being connected by having fun and enjoying each other. It has nothing to do with whether or not it‚Äôs more important than the other
---
Because Titans and Warlocks can't stand to see hunters having anything useful
---
Yes finish the step and at some point or right after you will talk to Ada and she will tell you to forge the weapon in a forge.
---
The nerf is irrelevant. The free wallhacks are the strongest part of it.
---
Ok thanks!
---
Uhhh speak for yourself, I myself am a very fancy Titan
---
You‚Äôre insulting, when I tried to prove my point. This is exactly what I knew I was getting into when you told me to change your mind. You don‚Äôt want your mind changed you just want a fight. You have no points to back up your argument so when you start losing you go straight to insults. It‚Äôs honestly laughable.
---
You done crying yet? Or you got more in you?
---
I... wouldn‚Äôt say ever
---
Probably newer content ok this helps thanks
---
Hooo num esperava isso, bom dia
---
This season.
---
Bright Engrams are always specific to the season they drop in.
---
These memes slap ass. I'm so glad I joined xD
---
That's what I thought at first (before I even read the text) but it's incredibly unlikely.
---
True tbh
---
It‚Äôs his shotgun to begin with. That‚Äôs like complaining that Thrall still has Doomhammer in WoW or that Masterchief still has the assault rifle. Plain dumb.
---
Servers were literally so fkn full when new light dropped that there was a fucking queue just to download. Servers have been spoty for a lot of people because they are still crowded. Over 1 mil monthly players and that was even BEFORE it went free to play. You sir are not just wrong. But an idiot. And dumb for spreading false info. Go cry somewhere else but dont bitch abt a dead game while you are an active member with plenty others around.
---
Good job man, i'm sure you"ll get it soon, good luck!
---
This list is shit. Ace isnt that high anymore. And jade is waaaay to low.
---
If you‚Äôre getting rushed with a bow, especially compound, release the shot and IMMEDIATELY punch. It‚Äôs enough damage to kill no matter where you hit as long as it‚Äôs fully drawn. Also make sure to stick to long lanes, close quarter weapons will guarantee shoot out a bow at choke points
---
Much appreciated
---
I keep OEM in my inventory incase i run into a meme build on the opposing team. That way I let the other team decide if they have to worry about a cheese op build or not. And at least having a mountaintop/recluse+OEM on our team as well lets us at least theoretically counter theirs. 
---
Otherwise, I don't use it outside of comp because it's just..I don't know, I like other exotics more. It's definitely fun when playing against people worse than or people who challenge when they have no reason to. Otherwise it doesn't scratch that itch visually or play wise.
---
I've gotta wrap Rose Art crayons in bacon to eat them when the wife picks them up just cuz "they're cheaper." Like whenever she gets them instead of Crayolas I look her straight in the eyes *looks all around, checks under the cusions and behind the curtains* and say "biiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiitch! I thought I told you the get the good shit!"
---
I feel u, got a smal clan since D2y1 thats still active. But some guys play different games sometimes. But we stil have our discord as a center where we hang out
---
True, foetracer only buffs damage to targets with 30 percent or less of health. No real benefit for precision weapons.
---
When it‚Äôs called way of a thousand cuts but you only throw 9 knives at a time
---
Tlw would be neutral &amp; ace the good one
---
If you find that entertaining than have at it. Are you really excited about playing on Mercury again? Hyped up for sparrow racing?  C'mon dude, be real about what's coming up.
---
Glad I‚Äôm not the only one with this experience.
---
How much time was spent killing teammates on the windmill?
---
This is better
---
Awesome
---
Ok
---
I got crayon scanvenger mod on all my Armor
---
Eater of Worlds
---
Xbox One, unfortunately :(
---
I think people forget how it was after rise of iron. Months of literally nothing to do. Grind the raid for what? Good armor, a ship? I'd way rather have seasonal content similar to y2 but I also understand that bungie being by them self now can't push that much content especially on the tiger engine. We still don't know what season of dawn activities will be like other then the first section of sundial so I'm holding hope it will be good while tempering my expectations.
---
My friend i carried to mythic was about the same way, but everytime I let him host, i could usually 1v3 the other team for whatever reason and at least come out with 2 kills
---
We have two new players in our team and we are running them through. They both did under 150k damage. That's how lol
---
none
---
Damn, I wished I packed my Xbox now to help players on Xbox as well
---
No the story MODE on destiny 1 is shit, the campaign on destiny 2 is good and the lore is practically better than halo
---
How did I not know that!
---
Thanks!
---
I as a hunter main am mad about handheld nova.
---
Sometimes I lose the 1v1 and sometimes I win the 1v5. I run oem bottom striker god roll spare rations and a good retold take. Or I run dust rock and not forgotten/ lunas
---
I see way more sniper than shotguns at Mythic and above. Or is that just me? Depending on the map I pun last word to counter apes. Otherwise Thorn. 
---
And I'm on Console. I honestly feel like Shotguns are really easy to counter.
---
Dang I can't help myself but push people off ledges or accidentally just through holes in the floor so big I should have seen them but didn't
---
It has a really high drop chance, I got it the first strike I did after I got the gun
---
Also people need to learn common mic courtesy. Set your activation levels and keep your mic away from nose/mouth so I don‚Äôt have to listen to an asthmatic pug wheezing in my ear for the duration of the raid. Also, mute buttons were invented for a reason, if you need to do something loud, use it.
---
Menagerie is nice because you don't need a full team for it, it is doable with randoms
---
Can someone make Cayde in Grave.
---
Usually going near them and jumping away works too.
---
Damn she sacrificed herself that's crazy
---
*one shots crystal*
---
Alright let's get this over with
---
I miss when sparrow ramming killed in D1
---
Because it's not really stated anywhere. It's just things you learn over time.
---
snipers and shotguns are meta rn and i think are both equally the top used. this was just more for the memesüòÇ idk shotguns on console seem really difficult for me to counter. the shitty FOV and 30fps cap make it hard for me to play against them. im used to seeing things in 60frames. damn you bungie
---
Regardless of other comments OP is still scummy for killing people he just saw spawn in
---
r/destinythegame
---
What sparrow is that?
---

Now you have to be lucky the wall doesn‚Äôt launch em. Lol

What do you use playing Gambit?
---
Tess sparrow. Braytech Dream9
---
Heal, damage buff, wall hacks. Ha, ‚Äúnerfed‚Äù.
---
I always tell myself I have enough health to survive. I never do.
---
Anytime man.
---
For all the people that think throwing knives are gonna be broken, go ahead and hop into the crucible and tell me how hard it is to hit someone in the head with a knife
---
Don‚Äôt forget the damage increase as well
---
It's just funny how fast it goes from "we figured out how to stop it" to "oh welp she's dead"
---
Yeah, if you don't run the right exotics, titans feel underpowered, for example, heart of inmost light with bottom tree sunbreaker, one shot stickies and you can stand in the sunspot of your kill to get your abilities back in a flash, kinda op, I just want titans to have a neutral game exotic that isnt the no skill OEM
---
How did they fall? What were you hanging them on?
---
Hard light on solar bro. Thats why.
---
I disagree
---
Well, thanks for the knowledge. This will make playing Gambit a little bit easier.
---
Same. Especially in arena.
---
To be fair I'm prone to being too focused on the big guys to notice that the thing I spun around to punch isn't a regular thrall... It's okay, my Ghost is really good at picking me back up again.
---
That‚Äôs true too
---
Pls explain how
---
Nothing yet, I just laid them on the floor for the shot.
---
That's the point
---
I hate to be that guy
---
But u spelled subtle wrong
---
They look good!
---
Your season/annual pass is cross save compatible so you will be good my dude. I was just checking the Bungie app and at the very bottom of the news, it confirms your season/annual pass is indeed cross save compatible
---
I straight-up cried when I got the "made shaxx proud" emblem
---
Blast Furnace
---
The new season of dawn mod slot is game changing not just some seasonal event bs.
---
Already checked
---
I can drive tanks and stuff like that just not them
---
Izanagi or whisper, recluse and 21% delirium (was hammerhead but got 21% last night)
---
Why haven‚Äôt I played this map ??
---
I am. I‚Äôve had problems with dailies as well
---
I usually bag to make people rage quit so it makes my life easier. Or if they bag first
---
Bungie bringing Cayde back would be terrible for the lore. How is anyone supposed to care about the characters if they can all just be brought back via time travel.
---
I think its fine if you like the wish ender or le monarch.
---
Except my one friend and every now and then I've heard people say that when I've joined iron banner lfgs or crucible ones
---
People do like to use the excuse actually
---
Does it really bother you?  No one is actually putting their junk on your head. Who cares?
---
Same here. Although going along with OP I also use the dab emote.
---
Ad hominem?
---
I finally did it and the only thing that was different from the other tries was amount of people that were there.  There were 5 randoms with me and we killed 9 out of 15 hydras and killed the gatelords really fast.  All the other tries I tried solo or with one other person and it didn‚Äôt work.  So maybe you have to kill the gatelords fast.  Just another theory to add to the list.
---
What is the gun at the top
---
Max range is a difference of about 3 meters as of shadowkeep so any barrel perk that gives you range is good enough.
---
discount my own opinion/experience as not useful or valuable for certain reasons
---
basically ‚Äúi would say my opinion is worthless because of my high dpi/sens, but my friends who play on more normal dpi/sens levels say the same thing‚Äù
---
If he were just a go between for us and the spider that would be great. We could buy the spiders stuff from Mithrax instead of having to travel to the tangled shore. Ideally I would like to have him as sort of like a ‚Äúsummon‚Äù. You talk to him in the tower, pay him some glimmer to hire him, then he can help you through basic missions if you don‚Äôt have a fire team.
---
If they bag first release the wolves
---
Mods are no longer added to your inventory, the mods are added to your collections. To find the mod itll depend what piece of armor it was for (void armor for sniper rifles)
---
I can actually see that working which is odd
---
Yup this.
---
You can wait, most of the items there are from other seasons, so I guess they'll be there in the new season (some may rotate)
---
Oh, I was sure it was a Machine Gun  
---
Thanks for making me know!
---
i want color soon too!
---
Yup did all that but had no space and no postmaster so I kinda fucked myself over
---
Fucking wish trust kept dropping on me like crazy
---
Seraphim toaster best toaster
---
Am I the only one that doesn't even use that radar?
---
You should put this on r/DestinyScreencaps
---
Don't worry, I feel the same about Pillager.
---
I just keep getting the same blue sidearm dropping
---
It stays on the ground until you go to orbit or start a new one.  Then it goes to your postmaster.
---
Also golden gun dosent count as hand cannon kills
---
Well, at least you need a dlc for the handheld, so people don‚Äôt spam and I think top tree gunslinger  is OP in PvP. it‚Äôs really dependant how you look at all the classes together.
---
Yeah it's only if they bag first
---
That's only when you have grenade energy. If you don't, the melee is slow and pretty garbage and the rest of the tree is mediocre. But when you do have full grenade energy it is pretty beastly.
---
It's the aggressive tracking and high explosion and detection radius exotic rocket launcher that has a three round clip

Absolutely wrecks an invader or as an invader

If I can find someone willing to

We must keep hope.
---
Oops! I'm a big Destiny fan too, although I am not a boy. I'm a rich old guy willing to pay top dollar for great new content but felt a little bit cheated after the last 60 bucks I found myself on the same moon maps we did years ago in Destiny 1. I love this game overall though.
---
*Loads shotgun* "Darkness? Nah, more like a buncha lil bitches"
---
Yup and i like it :P
---
I never knew i needed this until i saw it
---
It's a coordination issue. Raids after Leviathan require much more team coordination. Unfortunately that's a major hurdle for randoms. The  last boss for GOS requires so much teamwork and sub sections of movements. Ain't no coordination needed for Leviathan.
---
Rip floors and walls. :(
---
Squad of nine goes in but we destroy like 15 guardian crystals?

Oh so because they are fallen they are supposed to know each other hu??? Shameful
---
When did this happened
---
I'm surprised this is getting downvoted so much
---
Except we're on the Thanos end of the equation.
---
&gt;I‚Äôve also heard rumors of eating boxes worth of ~~crayons~~ batteries.
---
Np
---
Mithrax comes to the tower ‚Äúdamn its nice to finally be accepted‚Äù
---
Ikora and Zavala comes up ‚ÄúWelcome‚Äù
---
A random hunter comes up ‚ÄúI fuckin dare you to be the hunter vanguard‚Äù
---
Mithrax ‚Äú....‚Äù
---
I guess it's the Vinegaroo. I don't really like that one, I prefer the Legendary version which I can't remember the name of
---
Listen man. If your complaining about not being able to earn everything in eververse you relinquish your right to complain about lack of content
---
Same. Started up about an hour ago for me. Keep having connection issues on ps4 and xbox.
---
Ok so will they all be there or not lol
---
No way, everyone is talking ‚Äúclans‚Äù no, the misconception that you have to be an asshole when you raid is extraordinarily prevalent in Destiny today.  I get it frustrating to teach sometimes but sheesh, you meet some of the worst people in raid parties.  - straight fucking awful.  I personally love helping news peeps to the game.  
---
Then again seeing how Hunters and Titan do nothing but ruthlessly attack each other on here, I dunno what I expect.  OEM and OHK knives... and I just wanna know why they call him saint-14... where did the other 13 go?
---
Correct
---
Will Xenophage be available after the season ends as well?
---
OH! AND THE MOST IMPORTANT PART! HOW THE FUCK COULD I FORGET!!!
---
.
---
Sparrows on mercury! \o/
---
Big dead
---
That‚Äôs still aim assist
---
Traveler come protect us

Take your time and don‚Äôt kill the gate lord in a instant after the hydras. What me and my friend found is that the more time has past helps. So we gate lord very low and just wait around for the hydras. Once all the hydras are dead we wait for the message ‚ÄúGatelord is escaping‚Äù then we kill him and rise and repeat. Then the overlord spawns.
---
Nah. It‚Äôs all server side.
---
Damn hombrew dm‚Äôs
---
What a bummer
---
Let me pull out my magical crystal orb
---
He is trying to get the one at Hellmouth for the triumph
---
Bro, I‚Äôve been in the Army with a combat MOS for ten years and raiding with strangers makes me anxious.  Raids aren‚Äôt fun with strangers.  You‚Äôre 100% right.  I‚Äôm glad you brought it up and I‚Äôm glad people are offering their help.
---
Thanks for this üôÇ
---
Dregs promise. Now it‚Äôs a power weapon. Nothing else has changed.
---
They keep making all these changes without removing old things that never got worked on it‚Äôs weird to me.
---
Pobrecito...
---
Not very skillfull indeed but I get being proud of little achievements, we need those along the road to get better. That said you're gonna get those sarcasms because this shit here is so cheesy and toxic it took the crown off OEM titans even if it's in only one game mode. Good luck though !
---
I‚Äôm guessing you haven‚Äôt seen the season of dawn trailer or don‚Äôt quite understand that saint might be wondering why tf people have his helmet
---
Imagine expecting groundbreaking and fresh new content for 10$. Be happy were getting 3 brand new exotics along with SoD. If you cant be happy paying 10$ for 2 months of content then go play something else
---
Have you gotten multiple glittering keys
---
More trash/weeds than flowers lol more like, the needle in the haystack.  But the hay is radioactive and covered in AIDS. Without a magnet in sight üòÇ
---
That‚Äôs a god roll beloved on the wall isn‚Äôt it. You saucy devil
---
I have been visiting eris multiple times. The first mission went of without a hitch. Now however, i cant progress to the second mission
---
bold of you to assume i don't use my left hand
---
Preach.
---
Guts built like a titan but most certainly a Hunter no warlock sir
---
I need and I mean NEED a Shaxx variant of this!
---
Sorry I had to...
