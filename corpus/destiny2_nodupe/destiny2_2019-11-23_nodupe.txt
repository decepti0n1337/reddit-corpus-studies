Friday, everyone coming back from work wanting to play after being cucked out of their lifes the entire week, and Bungie has been chasing this server issue for 10 hours and is not even solved.  
---
Absolute incompetence.
---
I just want to get the engram from Xur
---
Amen to that, I've been grinding for the breakneck for like the past week and every other game when I get back home from work I'm facing a clan but in the early morning I'm getting somewhere between 15 to 20 guardians killed. Like I hardly get a match where both sides are putting in a real effort at the same time.

Cold heart for PvE wavesplitter for PvP

Lmao same. Been trying to get in so I can dismantle a bunch of stuff so I can get at least one thing from xur
---
Hunters have never had a one shot ability so this is good. Look at titans with bottom tree and thunder coil/shoulder charge w/ skull fort or warlocks with handheld supernova. At least hunter‚Äôs one shot ability takes a Crit to kill
---
I mainly played Destiny for PvP and after a ton of Overwatch just came back... for the PvP.  
---
But if you want PvP and didn't, personally, like the PvP in D1 then you probably wouldn't care for D2's either.
---
Well when its the best game on there and you give it to everyone for "free" why wouldn't everyone wanna blast destiny first Friday they got it. They just hadnt catered for demand.
---
r/epstein for added balance, for there must be a neutral ground
---
Aaand the post was deleted wtf
---
Then u are definitely a new light player, havent had the d1 cayde, and year 1 cayde so didnt really care much to the character, if u are an old player tho, i would really like to ape u in the crucible and striker-titan 3 times in spawn, u wanna react? Uh oh looks like u are marked now
---
Thanks.  Luckily I'm still good but I instantly started getting error messages once I loaded into orbit but I'm clear now
---
Warlocks are definitely meta
---
Off here with braindeadlands 3.
---
One of the many reasons I went and purchased destiny was to help it overshadow Craplands 3's launch.
---
brah i was about to say that you you brain idea stealler
---
I think that they made this change so that people didn‚Äôt overly rely on heat rises to get energy back, and instead doubled down on the ankle breaking floaty stuff that they might have wanted skylock to be. So I think that that would be a fine change
---
Also regarding some of the presumed points, I can see the new melee being similar to knife trick than ball lightning, if one is going to have an aerial build it‚Äôs likely that you might want more than conventional range to your melee. And also I‚Äôm pretty sure you‚Äôre still able to aim in midair.
---
You won‚Äôt able to chain abilities anymore but with these changes there‚Äôs a chance that playmaking is much more viable and less reliant on other abilities. Although there probably wouldn‚Äôt be any sort of harm in letting the new heat rises regenerate grenade energy on aerial kill, akin to devour
---
I grabbed it for bright dust way back when TLW dropped and have never taken it off. I like the ADS reticle way better on it, too. Can't put my finger on why, though.
---
Yea i was playing at the time and was killed by it.
---
Unfortunately I never earned it till far after the nerf
---
This ain‚Äôt it cheif

Fair point. I haven't been to big into tv since they finished up Son's of Anarchy. Been trying to find a show like it.
---
I cant tell you how much my respect for bungie increased when they added the prismatic inferno emblem, only those who got it know the real pain and its not OEM or LoW
---
He was an idiot. Ironic.
---
Probably intentionally put it for a limited time and when the queues return to normal, gone.
---
Drink uninstall this fiasco shit, then you install warframe instead, servers up 24/7, no problems, and thats a free game lol
---
Your RNG must suck then because Contraverse Hold. If they don't have Peregrine Grieves and they shoulder charge you, YOU win because you live and get to 1-shot them
---
I was thinking of getting one for groceries too

Are we going to be able to progress further with the Vow catalyst quest after this season? I'm at 40% and don't know if I'll complete it in time.
---
And Ace

I would use those and just xena battlecry every time I dive down on some poor earthbound titan. I dig it!

---

---
Totally agree with everyone, go Wavesplitter for PvP and Coldheart for PvE.
---
I‚Äôm at 22040 and it just keeps getting higher. Been waiting some 45 minutes
---
Why cant real guns look this artistic?
---
Well then.
---
‚Ä¢already have warframe, about 400 hours logged
---
‚Ä¢I don‚Äôt care about cost, love the developers and company so as soon as they split from activision I didn‚Äôt mind a $45 price tag
---
‚Ä¢Warframe has its fair share of problems. dead pvp, huge power creep and have you seen the prices of some things on tradechat?
---
I love Wavesplitter for strikes. Fireteam members pop orbs everywhere with their masterworked weapons.
---
Wouldnt be hilarious if they gave us an emblem with what resembles a weasel, that would be cool and a reminder of this seasons most recurring theme
---
Well they better get their asses to the moon because we are busy ghost-busting.
---
3k lol I'm at 20k rn
---
I'll check back in like an hour
---
Come on! Come on! Come on! Let's go space truckin!
---
Yes. However, the catalyst progress booster from one of the season pass rank ups will (I am 99% sure) go away and you'll have to earn it anew from next season's rank ups.
---
I would give gold to this comment but I‚Äôm poor so here‚Äôs this: üèÖ
---
You can compete, just have to figure out what your playstyle is and what weapons
---
Here at Bungie we offer the GREATEST video game experience . How would you rate you experience from I‚Äôve been here for 9 hours to Meh
---
Yes at least to alleviate our pain for today cut out
---
Somehow never came into rotation haha strange since I‚Äôve been grinding bounties for weeks

All day.

Lol.

I remember a few friends not getting on right away. I had no problems. 
---
But today is crazy
---
Serious answer: This is what people call the ogre boss in one of the Titan lost sectors. He is popular for testing different guns. If you want to test damage numbers, you must always use the exact same enemy for the values to be comparable.
---
I did. *sips drink* be offended.
---
Thats why I cant stand Gambit. One single moron can tank the team so hard.
---
who is joe
---
I'm aware, and its disappointing. Argos looked a lot cooler in the scorpion form than in his hydra form
---
Oh well.
---
agreed
---
amazing
---
Destiny item manager.
---
hehehe JOE MAMA
---
sry
---
Very Nice!
---
Seems like no one remembers Rise of Iron launch day
---
I'm a New light player and today I bought both expansions from the ps store when I was at work FML
---
Blade barrage is a super.......
---
I fully understand the penalty aspect. Bungie should find an easy way around that one. 
---
Past that, I wildly disagree. Firstly, server access is the first thing you pay for with online games. If bungie has to host the game, then you are paying to access that game. Second, server maintenance is mandatory. Sometimes that maintenance leads to accidental shutdowns that shouldn't happen st all, but the maintenance has to be done if you ever want to play. 
---
Lastly and most importantly, if you are not a destiny youtuber, like My name is Byf of Datto, then you should not be nearly as concerned with this game. Yea you paid for it, but everyone who paid fallout 76 paid for that shit show. Bungie doesn't have to supply nearly as much as they do for the price they do, but they are working their asss off to please the community. Since they have started to show promise with shadowkeep, Forsaken, and the split from Activision, I think we can give them a year with a little grace for once. I think it's safe to let some komentsfy hiccups slide. 
---
We can, however, still shit on how terrible d2 year 1 was tho. That sucked. Especially the story
---
I feel like you casually said "get some" after everyone of these kills.
---
This is so True lol.
---
I'm not seein' any traces of it :c maybe it was on my HDD. Not sure.
---
Link ?
---
One Eyed Mask, a Titan exotic head piece that is a really powerful in Player vs Player enviroment. If you recieve damage you will mark your enemy, if you defeat him you start healing yourself and also gain an overshield(overshield is basically double shield). This means if win a fight you can instantly push for another duel instead playing it slower to regen. In combination with a real good weapon loadout balance(and to an extend on your own skill) you can easily win 1v2 situations purely because netting the first kill resets everything for you with a bonus.
---
Thanks, I‚Äôll check it out. I was actually thinking about doing that next. Does it need to be on Heroic though?
---
**You just never quit do you? Took out ghaul woke up the traveler...**
---
Alright, Alright, Alright. Let see what we got!
---
Bungie! On the fixing!
---
I dont think so? Theres a lost sector with a computer you can interact with after you shoot 45 discs on the planet. Just google it man.
---
Yet
---
Me and my dad simultaneously waiting to get in while talking shit about the devs:
---
Yes when I read the status I was hoping this would get posted some where. I can hear that guys voice yelling at Dennis and Dee!
---
He has a point with the penalty portion. Past that, is a bit blown out of proportion. It's just a game after all.
---
It requires a charge up time for something the precision throwing knife should have had to begin with (just remove the auto refill on precision kill or refill the gauge by half...god forbid Hunters have a slight possibility of countering a Titan briefly)
---
who is joe mama
---
Triggered. I am a war with the cabal on Mars and shall be addressed as so

Yaaaaaaa at-least I won‚Äôt be tempted by one-eyed masked which is going to be nerfed
---
Ok Boomer.
---
dude, i left school hyped af and ran directly to my computer to buy OEM and grind the thorn and last word quests, only to see a 5-6 hour maintenance followed by another fucking maintenance.
---
Where are your corners?
---
Yea still, just saying...
---
You forgot tapir
---
Oh ok.
---
Then you eventually get to queue position #1 and get attacked by the Weasel
---
It's ok to have an opinion. It's the wrong one, but you're allowed to have it. ;)
---
&gt;I could be wrong on this bit
---
You're not
---
Definitely try it
---
I‚Äôve been there too
---
Ewwwwwwwwwwwww
---
Ok thank you, probably gonna have to wait though because Destiny‚Äôs down right now.
---
One thing to also point out is the fated engram from xur will drop at a higher stat level then if you pull from collections. Its usually at least a 10 point stat difference and will have a chance to be a different affinity. Also if you have everything in your collections and havent gotten a 2.0 armor piece of it to drop from nightfalls or random drops this gives you another one each week to try and drop (if it's not a gun)
---
Damn that‚Äôs unfortunate
---
Mango is that you lol same shit happened to my friend today
---
What roll did you get on that Trust?
---
Yeah, replay lair and the armor you get is 2.0. 
---
Really good rolls too. My raid drops have been in the 60s.
---
Fucking noted dan
---
Best one yet.
---
Bet
---
Can I get an explanation as to how stadia would fuck it up this bad?
---
Apparently me and mango are two fruits in a basket badum tss
---
To be honest Google stadia has very bad feed back with reviews aparently from many tec youtubers
---
Electric locks should fail open, not closed. Not saying Tesla does this, but it's definitely doable. E g. Using a spring that pulls it into the open position when not powered, or a mechanical backup system.
---
It‚Äôs a Friday night my parents are out of town and all I wanted to do after school was play some destiny. But NOOOOOOOO
---
Lol that's a good 1
---
Nah, that's just an Imago Loop with a gold shader
---
That's not true.  If it were true, only the 20 Stadia players would be affected.  This was playerbase-wide, a memory issue if I remember the Twitter thread correctly.
---
You will be credited but you won't get the silver until next season
---
Me and my friends did a triple bubble strat in mayhem, which resulted in someone having 230k damage which is the highest I have ever seen damage numbers go in PvP. If only my raid teams could do that much damage :,(
---

Ah yes my build but i use an enhanced ashes to assets atop all that, thing is i thought not many knew about this build

Just started in the middle of October so didnt pay that much attention to the vex offensive.
---
Yesterday I was about to start an extra long grind season with a friend as I have to change my rythm to night shift again and stay up for a very long time (and my gf was busy working on her master thesis also told her the day before I am gonna do totally nothing aside playing (+ usual routine and vital functions) as I am pretty stressed with life atm \^\^'). 
---
I was in a pretty good mood and had a lot of fun raging through crucible like a beast filling the channel of my friends with a good amount joyful laughter 13 hours ago.
---
My plan is to get my valor rank resetted the fourth and fifth time before the end of the season and to grind everything for the undying title.
---
Sadly I am not that certain anymore as this was kinda my last day off cause aside my college lectures and the necessity to read a lot for the upcoming exams I currently have to work 5 days per week during night time cause a shortage of personal. That means there is not much time left for me to play. 
---
Still trying to reach my goals (still have around 8-10 hours before going to sleep and get up for work and surely some days after) and sorry for posting this but I am already tired enough for being emotional :D and that day was a downer tbh.
---
I m sure you can, this SC was taken before forsaken
---
You spent 3 hours trying to get on when Bungie hadn't said the server was stable yet? What did you expect?
---
I think I should make a fire team for sg farming. Just post it to r/fireteam and run it till the server snaps again. Get some other people the og trench barrel.
---
I get that, and it has happened to me as well. Yolo. BAE. Yeet. But cuck has a very diffinitive meaning. A cuck likes watching someone desecrate something they love with pleasure. It is a fetish. It has turned into this weird swj insult that has no bearing on the word its self. Unless used in the right context I REALLY dislike people who use the word as an unassuming insult. Everything you said was perfect, right up until that point.
---
Thanks
---
Always loved the look of the stranger I miss her:(
---
This is fine

That's a... That's a good meme.

(This was the first thing I saw when getting on Reddit, thanks for the laugh xD)
---
Then you ARE Bungie
---
I don't think anyone's brought this up since shadowkeep's launch, even googling it brings up almost no results, but will Bungie ever think about bringing back the Taikonaut, or was this just a "REMEMBER THIS??" moment they threw in to mess with us for the CE?
---

Just gotta find a way to join his fire team and crouch walk while he‚Äôs in the menus.

My question is bungie nurf lunas and not forgoten and recluse and most other exotic weapons but why dose bungie not touch joton

So we forgot pocket infinity or vex or matador 64 gel winters lie shall I go on

Kinda holding out hope that ‚Äúfix the timeline‚Äù that we‚Äôll be doing next season brings her back, even in mention
---
And a cool vex leg.
---
I was quite sad faced over here.
---
How great would it be if they actually did make the tower a PvP zone that was also an active tower and not announce it?  You load in expecting a normal day and boom! Super to the face, guardians scrambling to talk to vendors with fights raging everywhere, thems the days.
---
Oh no real life Stromberg
---
This shoulda been the Undying Mind too
---
Gotcha. That‚Äôs what I hoped, I don‚Äôt have much of a chance getting legend right now, but at least I can work on the kills while I try and improve then!
---
Literally just turned on my PS4 after a long ass nap. Pls work

---
"Gonna get you, like a space boy!"
---
So it still isnt up?
---
I know its not that hard, just never really went for it before
---
You sound like a whiny idiot.
---
There were only 24k people on stadia Destiny 2 yesterday - total, not concurrent. Doubt that is the reason. Plus dmg admitted into Twitter it was a memory issue that creeped across their various systems.
---
Players who were there during the release of Rise of Iron.
---
Not really. Now I have to charge up a throw that is already hard enough to connect currently (seriously have done it a handful of times, then again I focus on using guns and not melee, so the story may have been different had melees OHK)...and they should already have OHK on precision in PvP...the friggin purpose of that throwing knife is to reward skillfull aiming/precision.
---
It's not like hunters can spam melee kill every throw they make...and if by some crazy chance we see a huge influx of hunters spam melee killing, remove the instant refill and have it restore half melee energy to prevent spamming....or remove the melee energy refund altogether.
---
If it had no charge time it would have been a good Titan shoulder spammer counter, but since we don't know the charge time, just having a charge time alone lengthens the kill zone for the charging Titan greatly.
---
Warlocks want capes and/or hoods, let us be more wizardy
---
I just got in
---
No
---
I‚Äôm in!!!
---
If my gear is gone I'm gonna fucking call a hit on Tim google
---
Alright, thanks
---
Might be Stadia as well. Or the servers just decided to die, because why not? New Light has been here for quite a while.
---
you could just focus on grinding out the kills now and don't worry about rank dropping, just try hard next season when the reset hits and climb with your best loadout
---
Same. Xbox one an PC

Everything is broken right now

Thanks Google

Now that's a meme I haven't seen I years

Yay us. It just came back up for me. But this was supposed to be date night and my husband gave up and went to bed ten minutes ago. Guess there's always next week...

Hey staring at Cabal through a sniper scope all day is hard work!

Its been 12 hours already of the shutdown or collapse or whatever im in que to connect 4042.
---
so they're just rng open world drops from anywhere?
---
Have you seen old man wakoski? He has 20k crucible kills on his darci
---
That was it's main reason for being an exotic. They would likely drop the super energy part as they nerfed the amount of energy orbs would generate and the amount exotics like Ursa's and Shards refunded.
---
But rocket launchers don't have the same punch like they did in D1, not even really the exotics, Truth and Ward being the real exceptions. *sigh* Come home Gally, we miss you.
---
Omg .Out loud

Funny thing is that it started with destiny for me. It took a while but it started to affect my other games. I eventually started to notice my other games crashing randomly, but I didn‚Äôt think anything of it until I was trying to play GTA and I couldn‚Äôt go 20 minutes without the game crashing, also I got a notice from Ark at one point telling me the game was corrupted and to try reinstalling it.
---
still the best pvp exo
---
Yeah, good luck man hopefully you do
---
Finally a 1 shot melee for hunter that doesn‚Äôt require an exotic or set up
---
Yeah I'm not bashing the players it's my favorite game period, ever. Maybe cause I spent so many nights playing during skme of the best and worst times of my life and never had issue with downtime... like ever... was always amazed that I could play all the way through resets and maintenance that's exactly what makes me draw said conclusions though

Did you complete bounties during the match? You don't gain points otherwise during matches.

*sees meme of somebody messing up, starts comment of how my luck is way worse*

That would absolutely ruin it for PVE. Recharging after precision kill is the only attractive thing about bottom tree melee

Well if you put it that way, I agree. Reape- I mean Salad Bar does look good.

Better the evil we know, understand and built, than the evil that traveled who knows how far, brought a truly unimaginable and impossible to defeat threat with it, that also was the sole root cause of the collapse and subsequent dark age.
---
The Traveler has done so much more harm than good.
---
Isn't it already part of Cerberus +1?
---
The item you‚Äôre looking for is Helm of Saint 14
---
I wish warlocks had better looking helmets,  i know most of the bonds look like garbage but better looking non exotic non ornament helmets would be cool, they all just kind of have a very bleh look
---
Don‚Äôt be a bhenchod. Just leave
---
I got it and went to crucible and was dropping 18+ kills in the 7ish games I played
---
Warlocks deserve trench coats
---
Niceeee
---
Tried it in crucible. Unpopular Opinion here: But an autistic child is easier to handle.
---
Damn. I was just about to launch into the crucible, now i'm having second thoughts lol
---
Thanks!
---
Just checked the site, he still has OEM lol
---
Omg
---
I installed a new light, hope you dont mind
---
Warlocks should get tailcoats, i want to look like a gentleman scholar when i nova bomb some poor fallen
---
I got that too
---
that's pretty dang good for a heavy sniper.
---
Yeah
---
The icon should be on the bottom left of the EDZ map, very strange
---
Then stop
---
*held the gun to traveler's head*

That is lore.

What is a heroic strike
---
No. You cant. Sixth Coyote is a Forsaken exotic. If you dont own Forsaken, you cant own any of the items that came with it. If.you only own the F2P version, you can only get year 1 exotics (and I believe a few others. There are a few lists floating around of what you can / cannot obtain as a F2P guardian
---
Strike playlist.
---
Oh no, god forbid Hunters get a single one hit melee ability as well after titans and warlocks have had multiple since launch
---
*nova warps entire team and then some* wHy JuMPy MAn gEt BUfF??!
---
I love everything about this.
---
Ermine Morn
---
You‚Äôd be right cause once a hunter got that, they never took it off. At least I didn‚Äôt
---
How about remembering the early days of destiny 2 with the weekly updates which took 6-12 hours. üò≠
---
But everyone says it's from nightfall and not strikes
---
Indeed
---
I know I definitely didnt. That cloak and the (I think it was) Malok helmet was my go to fashion.
---
I had completely forgot about Maloks helmet, good times
---
Meanwhile warlocks be like:
---
Didn‚Äôt phrase that very well. The heroic strike playlist is the playlist you‚Äôd normally access through the Vanguard Director.
---
Great times. Shame the uniqueness kinda drained out of D2 everyone more of less looks the same to me now.
---
nah it does like 130 lool
---
Same here honestly. See ya in a few more weeks guardian
---
Night Watch would be a great choice
---
I think you're just being picky at this point
---
Warlocks get the short end of everything
---
Insane

Check r/DestinyClanFinder

Isn't it "new" new light players?
---
Hey! Stop showing ubisofts server room!
---
I am not sure it is possible to get 100k in 920 on ANY week.
---
Thanks for this take on the question!  I tend to run auxiliary loadouts in group activities so I can generally make myself useful, but I know that some collaborations have pretty particular needs.  I haven't gunned for much of the pinnacle content in the current season, so this frame of reference is helpful!
---
Lucky for sure, one of the only perks to working overnight
---
Thanks, i hate it
---
The player base doesn't know the value of a dollar. They just keep throwing money, stupidly at shit we've already bought.
---
Neo is that you?!
---
Felt my hair get a little warm there
---
people who played D1 and had no variation at all probably
---
I‚Äôve never seen or Been able to ‚Äújust stroll away‚Äù tethered before.
---
Giddy giddy
---
I can hear Shaxx on that fucking tank. 
---
‚ÄúYEEEESSSSSS!  FIIIIIGHT FOREVER!‚Äù
---
Elsie Bray... What's not explained is who she is talking to.
---
The vow? Eriana's vow? What are you talking about? Its one shot per trigger pull. Its more like a hand canon sniper. Hence the scope and special ammo
---
Could you even fire our weapons off planet? Like, wouldn't the difference in gravity mean that you'd have to fire something high calibre to hit anything at distance? Not only that couldn't the combustion ignite certain planets atmosphere and probably blow you up?
---
I''ve got a case of Ulysses 31 flashback, remember that show anyone?
---
It is getting nerfed after this season
---
I didnt even noticed them
---
Exactly, its usually folks with TLW/shotty or any other HC/pulse/sniper/erentil
---
Tbh it would have been great if she just pulled that hand canon out and one shot you instantly.
---
Bro, I was only ever clapped because they had over shield the way to play against OEM is a split second decision either run until your healed and the effect is gone or you push and kill them so they cant take advantage of it, this nerf is fine
---
It‚Äôs a fact that killing the hydras changes nothing in the spawn rate. Anecdotal evidence doesn‚Äôt change that.
---
There is no heroic it‚Äôs not a public event
---
Still bugged here as well
---
Most annoying character in the game, end of story.
---
In destiny 1, yes. You could change RoF, fire mode, and I think something else I can‚Äôt remember rn. Look on the wiki and you‚Äôll see it.
---
I think that for the solar class super, the warlock gets draped in a cloak of solar energy that gives them a small amount of defense and has a solar staff that shoots out mini solar nova bombs. Same concept of the sword just with a staff. Just saying what I‚Äôd like
---
There isn‚Äôt any methods anymore
---
Dunn but ive gotten 3 in the last few days from doing strikes. All dropped from random enemies.  Think i was just lucky
---
Bungie said the seal and collections badge will be gone when the season ends. The pinnacle weapons are the majority of the seals time.
---
Once I saw a guy doing that I thought "well.... maybe they'll get it, so let me stand here to piggyback off their victory"
---
I end up going to my triumphs and seeing what I was missing
---
Next thing you know, new triumph pops up.
---
The guy got it, I ended up getting a free triumph
---
Ahh, alright, that makes perfect sense.
---
In the animation Saladin is portrayed as Sentiel, but in a cinematic of Destiny 1 he is seen utilizing the Sunbreaker hammer
---
Like others have pointed out guardians can vary their subclasses
---
Psions also sound very similar to Jackals as well as having the same body-type
---
Warlocks simply aren‚Äôt as OP as Hunters in PVP without Super usage. Don‚Äôt blame warlocks because you‚Äôre bad.
---
3 words bucko

High skill ceiling

i‚Äôm pretty sure that was a golden gun in the forsaken campaign.
---
Kids WB
---
Stay determined!
---
It's really good but it's also really weird
---
I have exotic weapons, finished the campaign, light lvl is 850, Why do I have only 6 of them then ?
---
Finally I have a one hit melee like everyone else
---
Ok boomer
---
Him pressing all buttons or when he shots the terminal?
---
Don't pay full price just for one exotic which is getting nerfed in 19 days unless money is not an issue.
---
Honestly we don't know much about Psions...I wanna learn more about their powers and their history, aside from being taken over from the cabal.
---
it is not in your inventory. go to the exotic the ornament is for and you can select it there under appearance
---
Very cool !
---
Pressing the buttons made me crack up while I was playing
---
Tey restoring your licenses. If you had it before it may just be a bug.

Sorry man

It‚Äôs hard to determine between sarcasm and toxicity on this sub these days
---
My bad
---
Yeah I thought I could edit the post but wouldn't let and what the hell is karma
---
Well, it's definitely not a speed reloader. Most of the hand cannon reloads in-game seem to rely on replacing the entire cylinder mechanism, sacrificing logic for speed. lol
---
Okay, thanks for answering i will try and find it.
---
Yeah, as far as I can call you can‚Äôt actually shoot them, but they do react by hopping away.
---
You're complaining about where it cuts off and not it's cropped and fucked up unwatchable aspect ratio?
---
How is shit like this upvoted? (The post, not your comment)
---
Packet sniffing missiles melt server integrity.
---
Should be able too. I played D1 before I had PS+ could do strikes &amp; story missions but I don‚Äôt think I could do raids of PvP stuff.
---
Why did you crop it and fuck up the aspect ratio? What's wrong with you you fucking masochist?
---
Lol this thundercats rip is dope!
---
in the wrong aspect ratio at that. nice.
---
Was gonna come back to d2 and fuck around on my warlock for a bit because the new buffs seemed cool, but now I change my mind since they can't fix our melee.
---
I didn't crop anything, I just posted the video as is
---
I didn't crop it. I just posted it as it was
---
Gimmi that shit rn
---
The biggest time suck for me was the Ritual weapons especially Randy's throwing knife and the Vanguard and Gambit quests for the shaders and emblems.
---
Good luck Gardian.
---
Pretty sure bungo wants to just to delete us at this point
---
No tips needed I think, if you were a D1 player then just keep doing the same. Mida multi tool isn't a great exotic weapon but it's useful at your stage. Many good one and some crap ones to come. I'd say try for Black armory weapons if you've got the add on otherwise just kill everything, do all the story steps and vendor bounties and the good weapon drops will come
---
What is... what?
---
I found it, i saw a video on youtube how to get there. Once you know where it is very easy to find.
---
How about day one of rise of iron
---
Alright, thanks!
---
Yes
---
It just works
---
doing the shadowkeep mission and realizing my guardian can actually speak. lol. he spoke at the garden to himself :D
---
Uh, yes.
---
Oh is it still going on? Is Shadowkeep on sale?
---
what do you mean "locked behind a paywall"? it just requires shadowkeep. its as locked behind a paywall as anything else in any dlc.
---
Could have been a tv show, if it was, I would watch
---
They're the 3 bosses from the D1 strike Dust Palace.

They also did this with Prometheus Lens. The one weekend PvP laser tag was pretty damn fun.
---
I‚Äôve also never done two in one week üòÇtoo much grinding for this guy. Must have gotten very lucky
---
Eventually, you'll want dlc after you've done all quests/exotics for new light. I'd wait until the game is getting stale for you, then go ahead and buy
---
No, you need psplus to be in a fireteam
---
Maybe it makes everything easier for them. Maybe cheating death helps their mental
---
Neither of those REQUIRE a headshot. . .
---
You really think a slow moving projectile that puts your gun away for a second that requires hitting a precise,  much smaller location is comparable to... the others who just "lol turn corner and let it rip"?
---
Found the Titan monkey
---
No point in hoarding guns that are duplicates or have bad perk rolls, though. Make sure you know which perks to look for
---
I mean the longer time to throw means it‚Äôs already gonna be worse for pve :‚Äô(
---
I wish it would do something more than just be a throwing thing in pve, like the other two knife abilities kick ass in pve in comparison
---
Yeah but to find out how much damage my launcher is to use it is pretty annoying and potentially inconsistent
---
Why not just add an 'Impact' stat like all other guns ? stupid bungie
---
anyway thx for linking the spreadsheet
---
On the Bungie.net website, when you view a characters game history -- Bungie lists previously played strikes as either "scored strikes' or 'normal strikes' [Screen shot of strike history.](https://i.imgur.com/QuGun85.jpg).  It appears that Vanguard Strikes (Strike Playlist) are unscored and don't count. The Nightfall: The Ordeal and Nightfall strikes are 'scored strikes' and count towards a 400,000 total.  The 400,000 figure I pulled from the app, Ishtar Commander. Hope this helps.
---
Up until this point, yes you will have everything with both. In a couple weeks though (assuming you dont buy shadowkeep deluxe), you will not have access to the new season pass content ($10 every season, but shadowkeep deluxe comes with a years worth)
---
Lol the gun took me so long to get you better damn well believe I‚Äôm gonna use it every single activity

Yea I think in pve if you get a precision hit it give you back grenade energy.
---
Erentils (and its clones) are the worst weapon to go up against, by far
---
Can confirm on the titan end of things as well
---
Platform?
---
I never said it was but you‚Äôre the one saying oem is op when it really isn‚Äôt. If you have skill you can pretty much bop anyone with anything equipped. If you don‚Äôt have skill and have the oem it just grants you extra time on 1v1s which again if you suck and don‚Äôt have good aim you‚Äôll get killed. Like I don‚Äôt see your logic in arguing about the meta either cause again it comes down to skill. I‚Äôve had 25 plus kill games with blue and white weapons and I‚Äôve had less kill games with  the ‚Äúmeta‚Äù
---
Id say go go through and take a look at any duplicates, dismantling all but the best rolls for how you play.  If you don‚Äôt already, try checking out destiny item manager, its super useful for searching for specific perks.
---
I haven't had a good laugh like that in a minute.

I've tried that it like the down time that happens yesterday but it only affects IO and I'm trying to do my nascent dawn quest and I have to go there XD

What the fuck kinda abomination of a guardian is that?

Just keep one or two of each type(shotgun,scout, seasonal,etc.) comes in handy when doing bounties that require those weapon kills and make sure the rolls you have on them are beneficial to your gameplay.

Everytime I go there, there is more ppl than in the tower.

I would maybe try bungos forums too. Good luck!

They should be rare but with elemental affinity and random stat rolls now, they need to increase that drop rate a bit.  \*Waits for try hards to troll this post
---
 This is great and all, but whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus STORK and WEASEL . From what I can gather these fuckers command the Destiny servers from an Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Our beloved servers
---
Can you try to explain it here? There are many people on here that can likely answer your question.

They should bring it back and get rid of the delay completely. I doubt it would be an outlier in current D2 PvP.

Run through all of the available story missions with him/her.  Its always fun to support a little light.  When I did this with a couple of my friends during forsaken, I would hang back and let them do most the work, explore, etc and would jump in to revive or bail them out of tough situations.  Was a fun, relaxing run back through the story.
---
# The Current State Of Destiny 2 On PC (2019 (Part 4))
---
# The Crucible (Part 1)
---
Speaking of the Crucible... I completely despise this game mode because of how imbalanced it is. However, I will say that most of my time spent playing Destiny 2 is PvE related, so again take what I say with a grain of salt.
---
# Player Choice
---
The first issue I have is that I can't simply play whatever game mode I want to. If I only want to play Clash, I should be able to, likewise for every other game mode. With that said, I do actually enjoy playing other game modes such as Control and Supremacy, but the option to play whatever I feel like playing would be appreciated.
---
I'm also aware that a rotating playlist is an option, but it doesn't include every game mode, and doesn't always include the game mode(s) I like.
---
# Rating System
---
Second, like with Gambit, polarizing matches are far too common, where your team just gets decimated, and you're left frothing at the mouth because of how upset you are. With this in mind, I'm not sure why some kind of skill rating system (MMR, CSR, ELO) doesn't exist in the game.
---
If one does exist, it's not very good. And, what confuses me the most is that there's a [web site](https://destinytracker.com) that actually calculates your ELO and displays it for you to see. Not only that, but it has different ratings for each game mode! Why Bungie doesn't just implement this into the game (with the site owner's permission) is beyond me, as it would drastically improve match quality and make the game mode actually enjoyable.
---
# Level Design
---
Next up, I think the current level design of the game is terrible! Maps are either way too small, have huge sight lines, tons of nooks and crannies to hide in or behind, or just aren't built for 12 players. For example, Twilight Gap is by far my most hated map of them all.
---
It's extremely small, compact, and can be like a maze if you're not familiar with its layout. It also has two layers to it with many doorways, openings, gaps in the floor, and even an elevator shaft. Gambler's Ruin is another such map that's small, compact, and maze-like, but not the extent of Twilight Gap.
---
The problem is that these maps offer very little time for anyone to think, get their bearings, and formulate a plan, so most people simply result to the path of least resistance, which is to use shotguns, SMGs, and hand cannons. They then run around the map blisteringly fast, killing everyone in their way.
---
And, since these maps are so tiny, you often run into the issue of what I'm going to talk about next.
---
# Spawning &amp; Respawning
---
The spawning mechanics of the game are absolutely abhorrent! So many times have I died only to respawn directly in front of someone using their super, or into a hail of bullets. I've also literally spawned with people from the enemy team.
---
For example, I once respawned and took a few steps forward. I then heard an enemy cast their super, so I turned around and started running the other way. I got to about where I had just respawned when another enemy came around the corner and cast THEIR super. I then ran to my right, up some stairs and ran into a third enemy who immediately opened fire and killed me... How is anyone supposed to have fun when stuff like that happens?
---
**(I will admit that this was a rare occurrence, but stuff like this happens to me way too often!)**
---
Spawning gets even worse when you take into consideration that you can purposely control where your enemies spawn through a tactic known as, ‚ÄúSpawn Flipping.‚Äù If your entire team rushes to the other side of the map, that lowers the available locations to spawn players in, thus allowing you/your team to predict where your enemies are going to spawn.
---
At this point, the game essentially becomes a game of Cat &amp; Mouse, chasing your enemies from one side of the map to the other. However, I know that this is in the game for a reason. If we spawned in set locations regardless of enemy players being present, we'd run into the issue of spawn campers, and no body wants that, but spawning needs to be better and I think part of that can be achieved with bigger maps.
---
# Gear
---
The next thing I'd like to mention is gear. Like I've stated previously, I despise playing Crucible. But, I play it because I can get PvE gear from it. IMO, PvE and PvP should be completely separate from each other. Meaning, I think there should be a completely separate set of armor for the Crucible just like there is for Gambit Prime.
---
I believe that an additional stat (Endurance) could be added to accommodate this.
---
# Endure The Pain
---
Endurance could reduce the overall amount of damage that you take from other players in the Crucible. This stat would appear on Crucible armor only in the same way that Gambit Prime roles are tied to Gambit Prime armor.
---
The maximum amount of Endurance that you could reach could be 15 (+3 per piece of armor), and a new consumable, ‚ÄúStimpack,‚Äù (+3 Endurance) could be added alongside this new armor so that players could still use an exotic piece of armor with their Crucible armor.
---
The reason why I'd like this to happen, is because I feel as though the Time To Kill (TTK) is waaaay too short. Especially when you take into consideration that we're supposed to be playing as interstellar space zombies with magical powers and high-tech gadgets!
---
Endurance could reduce player damage received by a factor of 1% per point, up to 15%, maybe even more if this isn't enough. Unlike Gambit Prime, this armor wouldn't be required to play in the Crucible, and players wouldn't even have to use it if they're confident that they don't need it.
---
Yes, Robot Chicken! This is precisely what I meant!
---
# The Crucible (Part 2)
---
# The Redjack Revolt (Story)
---
The last thing I'd like to talk about is a new game mode that I call: ‚ÄúThe Redjack Revolt.‚Äù (Revolt for short) However, before I get into what the game mode would actually be, I'd like to go into detail about what the Redjacks even are.
---
The [Redjacks](https://destinypedia.com/redjacks) are: ‚Äúmilitarized frames used by Lord Shaxx to secure potential Crucible sites and Sparrow Racing League courses from hostile forces.‚Äù Since these frames lack sentience and the powers of the Light, they are deployed in huge numbers to overwhelm their opponents and are assisted by Guardians.
---
Very few of them ever return from their first battle, and even fewer manage to survive more than one encounter. The few that DO return from deployment are linked together to share their combat data and improve their combat performance. The data is also saved and uploaded to new frames.
---
However, there are two specific Redjacks of note: Arcite 99-40 and Dahlia 99-40, both of which are Shaxx's personal combat frames.
---
# Arcite 99-40
---
Being the last of Shaxx's personal frames, Arcite's combat systems were removed and replaced with the Tower's vendor protocols when Shaxx began handling Crucible affairs. However, Arcite's memories are all intact; He remembers the many battles that he once fought and was once sent to deal with members of Tex Mechanica who were trying to fix Crucible results for profit.
---
After the fall of the Last City to the Cabal, Arcite and Shaxx relocated to The Farm where Shaxx continued to run the Crucible and Arcite became the local Gunsmith. When the Last City was reclaimed, Arcite resumed his duties alongside Shaxx where he assists in managing the Crucible.
---
# Dahlia 99-40
---
Dahlia is a senior member of the Redjacks and, over the course of her service, has been tasked with scouting and securing potential sites for the Crucible and Sparrow Racing League. Since her activation, Dahlia has participated in over forty combat missions. When Arcite was pulled from active duty, many questioned why it wasn't Dahlia instead, given her rather impressive portfolio.
---
She has extensive knowledge of the gear produced by the foundries, is fluent in most, if not all, gear designed and distributed by the foundries, and her combat expertise is so vast that many would like to give her authority to organize combat tactics.
---
# The Plot
---
At this point, it's worth noting a couple things. First, Arcite is the only frame able to sync combat data with Dahlia. And second, Dahlia conspired with Arcite to modify one of the other Redjacks. While the reason for this conspiracy is unknown, I have an idea of what they were doing.
---
It's possible for frames to learn from experience and develop their own personalities over time. But, what if they can also become fully sentient like Exos? Frames were developed during the Golden Age just like the Exos, but aren't nearly as advanced.
---
But, if Dahlia did somehow develop full sentience, perhaps she also developed some level of disdain for Shaxx and the other Guardians. The reason for this disdain would be over her inability to link with the other Redjacks and share her combat data with them, saving countless frames from death.
---
Unable to modify herself or communicate with anyone other than Arcite, Dahlia would restore Arcite's combat systems and upload a virus to his neural network in the process. This virus would cause him to view Shaxx and the other Guardians as enemies, making Dahlia and the other Redjacks his only allies.
---
Dahlia would task Arcite with modifying a Redjack for her, allowing her to link and share her information with it. Dahlia would then abduct Lord Shaxx and a handful of Guardians then attempt to flee the Last City with Arcite and the other Redjacks to formulate a plan on how to capture the city and steal the Traveler's Light.
---
However, Ikora Rey and Commander Zavala would be quickly made aware of the disappearances of Lord Shaxx and the other Guardians, and would task the player with investigating the matter. Upon retracing the events that led to the abductions, Ghost and the Guardian would quickly track down Arcite and Dahlia to their base in Bannerfall within the city before they could leave.
---
A fight would ensue, Arcite would become injured, and Dahlia would escape with the Redjacks, captured Guardians, and Shaxx in tow, leaving Arcite behind to be captured. With Arcite captured, Ikora would task Asher Mir with studying him.
---
Through this, Asher would discover the virus and undo the damage done to Arcite's neural network, restoring his peaceful nature. Asher would also learn that Dahlia intends to rip the light from Shaxx and the other Guardians, infusing it with herself and other Redjacks to create more powerful versions of themselves, on par with the Guardians.
---
However, no known location of Dahlia's new base would be found. With no one to run the Crucible, Arcite would take up the mantle of Crucible handler once again and Guardian training would continue. However, Dahlia would eventually make herself known by somehow installing a new mode of training to the Crucible without Arcite's Knowledge or permission: The Redjack Revolt (Revolt).
---
The purpose of this game mode would be to test her Redjack's combat capabilities and lethal effectiveness as well as the new potential of the Light-Infused Redjacks on Guardians so that she may see her plans come to fruition. Ikora and Zavala would see this as an opportunity to learn the location of her whereabouts and, hopefully, figure out how to restore the light to the captured Guardians.
---
They would allow Ghost and the Guardian to enter this new arena and the Redjack Revolt would begin!
---
# The Redjack Revolt (Game Mode)
---
With all of that said and done, let's jump into what the Redjack Revolt would actually be!
---
The Redjack Revolt (Revolt) would be a 12 Vs 12 competitive game mode in the Crucible where 12 Guardians would face off against 12 Light-Infused (player controlled) Redjacks. This would be a combination of Control and Gambit in the sense that there would be Zones to capture and Hostiles to kill.
---
The goal of the assaulting team would be to capture as many zones as possible to draw out the defending team's, ‚ÄúLieutenant.‚Äù Once drawn out, the assaulting team would have only 5 minutes to kill the Lieutenant and win the round. If the defending team prevents their Lieutenant from dying, they win the round.
---
Each match could consist of three rounds, and whichever team wins 2 rounds wins the match. There would be four types of Hostiles: Base, Elite, Major, and Ultra. Base and Elite Redjacks would spawn automatically every five minutes for both teams.
---
Major Redjacks would spawn alongside the next Hostile wave on the defending team's side whenever a zone is captured. And, Ultra Redjacks would spawn alongside the Lieutenant once the initial timer runs out. Killing Base and Elite Redjacks would accumulate points that would trigger air drops for your team.
---
These air drops would aid teams in their goal of either assaulting or defending by providing additional ammo, heavy artillery such as Scorch Cannons, or even allowing teams either to booby trap zones with mines that would need to be dismantled or speed up the capturing process.
---
Lastly, the Light-Infused Redjacks that players would control on the assaulting team would essentially inherit whatever abilities, items, and class the player had equipped at the time they were infused. (The only thing that would change would be the look of the player, basically)
---
# Revolt Conclusion
---
The reason why I came up with this game mode was simply because it seemed like something that could be fun to have in the game. While trying to think of a way to implement Endurance into the game, I somehow stumbled upon the lore of the Redjacks and the Redjack Revolt was born.
---
# Crucible Conclusion
---
The Crucible is just terribly imbalanced and desperately needs to be refined. Maps need to be bigger and less intertwined. More player choice would be nice, allowing us to play literally whatever we want whenever want. Spawning needs to be better.
---
Some kind of skill rating system such as destinytracker's ELO system needs to be put into the game to prevent polarizing matches from occurring. And lastly, playing video games should be fun, not aneurysm inducing!

# The Current State Of Destiny 2 On PC (2019 (Part 5))
---
# Public Events
---
Public Events ‚Äì Dynamic Events in other games ‚Äì are a really interesting concept to have in a game like Destiny 2. To be honest, I actually enjoy them a great deal. However, I do have a couple issues with them. First, in some areas, such as the Moon, PEs take a very long time to spawn but, in other areas like the EDZ, there are always at least two events happening at all times.
---
The reason why I think this is an issue is because of quests. Some quests in Destiny 2 have you complete PEs. But on the Moon, for example, this can be very frustrating when you miss the event you need and have to wait a long time for it to return.
---
I'm not sure if this is simply due to the size of these areas, or if it's simply a matter of there just not being enough events period, but it'd be nice if some kind of PE was happening at all times on all destinations. Second, I find myself frustrated at the lack of knowledge that people have regarding how to make some PEs Heroic.
---
I'll be honest, I still don't fully understand how to make some events Heroic myself, but it'd be nice if Ghost would simply tell us, ‚ÄúHey! Do this, dummy!‚Äù I do try to type out what needs to be done for the events that I know how to make Heroic, such as with the Taken Blight events, but because the chat system in this game is so out of the way, it seems like either no one sees my message, isn't paying attention, or just doesn't care.
---
The last thing I'd like to bring up about PEs is that there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of variety in events. In fact, almost every event on the Tangled Shore is the exact same thing, just with different bosses, for example. One thing that'd be really cool (IMO), would be world bosses.
---
Basically, when these bosses spawn, the planet the boss is on would have a big red boss icon next to it indicating that a world boss has spawned on that planet. (Talking about the destinations map) A big, hard-to-miss message would appear on everyone's screens (that are one the planet with the boss), and a loud sound would play.
---
These bosses would essentially be the equivalent of raid bosses, but in the open-world. An added benefit to these bosses is that they could be used in further Pinnacle/Exotic quest lines. Only one boss would be active at a time and, understandably, would have a large respawn time. Say, once every thirty minutes.
---
They could also have a chance to drop Pinnacle gear and even Exotics, as well as Enhancement Cores/Prisms and even Ascendant Shards. The loot tables could look as such:
---
**Base:**
---
* Glimmer
---
* Legendary Shards
---
* Planet-Side Currency
---
* Rare Gear
---
**Common:**
---
* Legendary Gear
---
   * OR
---
* 1x Enhancement Core
---
**Uncommon:**
---
* Pinnacle Gear
---
* 2x Enhancement Cores
---
* 1x Enhancement Prism
---
**Rare:**
---
* Exotic Gear
---
* 5x Enhancement Cores
---
* 1x Ascendant Shard
---
**(I'm not suggesting that every item in the loot table(s) WOULD drop, just that they COULD drop with respect to their rarity)**
---
Each Guardian that participated in the world boss event would receive the base rewards every time, but would also have a chance at getting any of the common, uncommon, or rare drops chosen randomly by the game.
---
The most common drop would obviously be a random legendary item, but enhancement cores would also drop pretty commonly, say around 80% of the time. However, the amount would vary greatly.
---
The reason for this is because upgrading gear is ridiculously hard now, especially if you're actively playing three different characters. This would just make that process a little easier.
---
# Conclusion
---
All-In-All, I actually very much enjoy events in Destiny 2. I just wish they were more common in certain areas, easier to make Heroic, and had a bit more variety in terms of difficulty and mechanics.
---
I did the same thing
---
I hate that map for these very reasons, I either spawn and immediately get into a shotgun fight or face off against a super, no in between lmao.
---
New light is just what the idea of making it free to play is called. It‚Äôs not a thing you can avoid. The changes affect everyone, whether you bought the game or are getting it free. So whether you play on battle net or steam doesn‚Äôt matter. Whether you use your current character or just start over doesn‚Äôt matter. It‚Äôs the exact same game for everyone.
---
No.
---
# The Current State Of Destiny 2 On PC (2019 (Part 6))
---
# Customization
---
# Shaders
---
Next up, I'd like to go over my thoughts on customization. First thing is that I despise the current shader system. I find myself spending literal hours in my collections panel, looking for something I like only to give up and find something else to do.
---
The main reason for this is simply because we can't choose which colors go where. Even if we could do something like rotate the shader so that the colors apply in a different way, I'd be happier. At the very least, I'd like it if all we had to do to apply a shader is right-click the gear we want to color, scroll down to the appearance section, and hover over the shader menu.
---
Then BAM! All of the shaders are right there, waiting to be applied. At this point, it would simply be a matter of finding something you like and applying it for the same cost as it takes to reacquire the shader from the collections tab. However, this isn't the case, and I really don't understand why Bungie would make such a limiting system.
---
Now, Guild Wars 2 (GW2) has a very good system for changing not only the color of their gear, but the look of it as well. In terms of coloring your gear, almost every piece of armor in the game has anywhere from one to four dye channels. This allows the player to apply any dye they've unlocked to any of the armor's available channels completely for free. (Weapons can't be dyed for some reason)
---
This allows for an unimaginably large amount of customization options and makes it impossible for anyone NOT to find something they like.
---
# Ornaments
---
Another thing ArenaNet has done really well with GW2 is allow players to make any piece of armor and weapon look like any other piece of armor or weapon. There's a menu called the, ‚ÄúWardrobe,‚Äù and in it is every armor and weapon skin you've ever unlocked.
---
If you have an item called a, ‚ÄúTransmutation Charge,‚Äù you can apply the look of any piece of gear to any other piece of gear of the same type. I know a similar system like this already exists in Destiny 2 in the form of the, ‚ÄúCollections,‚Äù tab ‚Äì as I mentioned earlier ‚Äì and, ‚ÄúOrnaments,‚Äù but it's extremely limiting.
---
To my knowledge, instead of being able to apply the look of literally any piece of gear to any other, you can only apply certain ornaments to certain gear. Yes, there are universal ornaments, but if I want a bad-ass raid set to look like a basic leveling set, why can't I do that?
---
I know this is a very petty issue to have with a game, but given how video games have shifted over the years, a good character customization systems seems like a staple to any kind of RPG, and Destiny 2 just doesn't have one.
---
# Weapons
---
Speaking of weapons, I have quite a bit to say about them as well! (Who could've guessed?) The main issue I have with them is how they're classified now. With the launch of Forsaken, Destiny 2 saw the biggest weapons change of it's life: ‚Äúthe freedom to slot powerful weapons in either the kinetic slot or energy slot.‚Äù
---
In my opinion, this was the single worst change that Bungie ever made to the game because it completely broke PvP! Not only that, but their wording is also very misleading; They made it sound as though you'd be able to take literally any power weapon and put it in any slot you'd like, not that some power weapons would simply become non-power weapons.
---
Snipers, Shotguns, and Grenade Launchers should all be power weapons only, IMO. Because, these weapons create such a huge power disparity between teams. I know that it still takes skill to use these weapons, I myself am not very good with them, and that they use special ammo, but, from what I've experienced, if someone's sniping, using a shotgun, or some other power weapon... I'm done for. It's, ‚ÄúGame over, man. GAME OVER!!!‚Äù
---
This is because some people have become so good with these weapons that you just can't counter them by reasonable means. You could argue that I just need to improve or change up my play-style (you'd be right), but that doesn't change the fact that power weapons were classified as power weapons because of how POWERFUL they are.
---
# Classifications
---
Currently, there are: Kinetic, Energy, and Power weapons with: Primary, Special, and Heavy ammo types in the game. To me, this is super confusing because, it would make sense that a Kinetic weapon would only use Kinetic (Primary) ammo.
---
Energy weapons would only use Energy (Special) ammo, and Power weapons would only use Power (Heavy) ammo. This isn't always the case. Certain weapons like, ‚ÄúIzanagi's Burden,‚Äù and, ‚ÄúFighting Lion,‚Äù are classified as Kinetic and Energy weapons respectively.
---
But, use the opposite ammo types (IB uses Special ammo and FL uses Primary ammo). With this in mind, I propose that the classifications of weapon and ammo types change to the following:
---
* Primary 	weapons (Primary ammo);
---
   * Auto Rifles, Pulse Rifles, Scout Rifles, Side Arms, and Sub Machine Guns
---
* Secondary weapons (Secondary ammo);
---
   * Bows, Fusion Rifles, Hand Cannons, and Trace Rifles
---
* And	Power weapons (Power ammo)
---
   * Machine	Guns, Linear Fusion Rifles, Swords, Sniper Rifles, Shotguns, Grenade Launchers, and Rocket Launchers
---
Why Bungie made the 2.0 change to weapons is beyond me, but they should change it back because it would streamline the weapon system and clear up any confusion it once had. It would also return the power balance of weapons and make PvP somewhat enjoyable.
---
Any chance you found a fix?
---
If that's bad. Should see my raid banner kd

# The Current State Of Destiny 2 On PC (2019 (Part 7))
---
# Artifact Power
---
On the topic of power, I'd like to briefly mention Artifact power. I'm sure everyone has already guessed what I'm about to say, but here's my opinion regardless: I think it should be removed because it's misleading. The concept of power level can be a bit confusing. However, [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX0IWNBApwI&amp;t) video explains it quite clearly.
---
**(Since it's an extremely old video, I'm not sure if it's still relevant, but I couldn't find anything else to help me understand how power level works)**
---
In case you don't care to watch the video, it explains how our PL affects the damage we deal and the damage we take. If you are at a lower PL than the activity you're trying to do, you will take more damage and deal less damage. However, if you are at or above the recommended PL of the activity, you'll start to take less damage, but you won't necessarily see an increase in the damage you deal.
---
This is because the only thing that affects how much damage you do ‚Äì again, at or above the recommended PL - is the PL of your equipped weapons. For example, my current PL is 971 (951+20 AP). If I do an 820 Nightfall Strike, I should be taking significantly less damage (a max of 40.9% less damage) because my PL is significantly higher than the PL of the activity.
---
Using a challenge card, I did some testing with two sniper rifles of different PLs (they were both D.A.R.C.I rifles). First, I reduced my PL to 800 and found that the damage I dealt was significantly lowered. I then raised my PL to 820, matching the activity, and my damage went up, but that's because I was now at the recommended PL, not because my PL went up per se.
---
**(I also tested to see if my damage would go up or down if I did nothing to my PL and found that there was no difference in my damage at 971 or 820)**
---
Keep in mind that the above tests were all done with a D.A.R.C.I at 951 PL. So, when I changed to my 931 PL D.A.R.C.I, I found that my damage did go down even though I made sure to keep my PL at 820.
---
With all of this said, I hope y'all can see what I mean when I say that the additional power level from the seasonal artifact is misleading. Yes, it does provide a damage reduction benefit, but it doesn't provide any sort of damage increase, thus giving us a false sense of capability.
---
# Tooltips, Items, and Inventory Space
---
Another thing that can be misleading are the tooltips in the game. Often times, I'll read the tooltip of something only to be left wondering what the hell I'm supposed to be doing. An example of this is with the Platinum Starling exotic ship. The tooltip for the ship in the collections tab reads, ‚Äúfound by completing Gofannon Forge ignitions.‚Äù
---
But this isn't the case at all. In fact, the Platinum Starling has nothing to do with the Gofannon Forge specifically. Instead, I've read that you have to complete a specific triumph called, ‚ÄúMaster Smith,‚Äù to unlock it. This triumph has you forge 100 Research and Black Armory weapon frames, but it doesn't matter which forge you use to do this.
---
Instead of the above, why not just have the tooltip for the Platinum Starling read, ‚ÄúUnlocked by completing the Master Smith triumph,‚Äù if this is the case?
---
**In conclusion.** I would simply appreciate it if the game had accurate tooltips.
---
# Items
---
On the topic of accuracy... From what I can tell, the game has three major categories of, ‚ÄúItems,‚Äù: Bounties, which I think should be renamed to, ‚ÄúTasks,‚Äù Consumables, which is any item that is consumed when you use it, and Quests. Currently, there are only two major tabs for these items: ‚ÄúQuests,‚Äù and, ‚ÄúInventory.‚Äù
---
Inside the quests tab are two sections, ‚ÄúQuests,‚Äù and, ‚ÄúBounties.‚Äù I think that both sections of this tab should be integrated into the inventory tab. I also think that the, ‚ÄúModifications,‚Äù and, ‚ÄúShaders,‚Äù tabs should be removed as both are stored in the collections tab now. (Cosmetic items should just automatically be unlocked and stored)
---
Then, in the inventory tab, I think that Quests, Quest Steps, Quest Items, Pursuits, and Tasks should all be stored in an, ‚ÄúEndeavors,‚Äù tab with their own, separate sections in said tab. And Consumables should have their own, ‚ÄúConsumables,‚Äù tab in the inventory with Currencies, Redeemables, and Materials having their own, separate sections.
---
The reason why I think such a big change needs to happen is because, like so many other aspects of this game, the two aforementioned tabs are just so messy and inaccurate to some degree. When I first came back to this game, I was so ridiculously confused by the many different items I had that I just completely cleared everything from my inventory and quests just so I could pick everything up again and get an understanding of what everything was.
---
# Here, At The End!
---
Please remember that the whole point of this article wasn't to bash Bungie in any way at all, but to express what I think needs to change with the game. I'm fully aware that everything expressed in this article may not speak to everyone (or anyone), but I felt as though I needed to put my thoughts out there.
---
I truly do wish Bungie the best with Destiny and any other endeavors they undertake, and I look forward to seeing what Destiny's future holds.
---
If you made it this far into the article, I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for reading it!

# Honorable Mentions
---
# LFG
---
It'd be nice if some kind of in-game LFG existed that allowed players to find groups for every activity in the game within the game instead of having to use third party sites/apps.
---
# Collision Detection
---
I wish there was an option to turn on/off collision detection in regards to running into allied Guardians. Meaning, I hate it when I go to pick something up and another player runs into me.
---
# Friendly Fire
---
It'd also be kind of funny if friendly fire existed in the game. Because, so many times have I been using either a rocket launcher or grenade launcher (in Gambit) and an ally would walk in front of me right as I fire the explosive making me die as a result. It'd be funny if they died with me is all I'm sayin'. :P
---
# Loading Screens
---
And lastly, loading screens are way too long and too frequent. I'd much rather have to fly my ship (manually) to and from each destination in the game like we do with our Sparrows. This could also open up a whole new avenue for customization, as ships would play a more important role in the game.
---
Year 1 raids.
---
It‚Äôs a character from the first game was never a gear set unfortunately
---
# The Current State Of Destiny 2 On PC (2019 (Part 8))
---
# TL;DR
---
* **Story:** The story campaigns are too short, Forsaken was extremely tedious, It'd be nice if we had a reason to revisit the Red War campaign, and I'd like it if the lore books in the game were voiced by the characters narrating the books.
---
* **Gambit:** The activities within the Gambit playlist need to be condensed into one big game mode, roles need to be reworked to have a much greater impact on the game, prime armor should be mandatory even to play Gambit Prime, and the invading systems needs to be completely reworked.
---
* **Crucible:** The Crucible is terribly imbalanced and needs to be refined, maps need to be bigger and less intertwined, remove the rotating playlist and allow us to choose any game mode we want to play, spawning needs to be better, and some kind of skill rating system needs to be put into the game.
---
* **Public Events:** Need to be more common in certain areas, easier to make Heroic, and need to have more variety in terms of difficulty and mechanics.
---
* **Customization:** Greater control over how gear is colored is needed, it'd be nice if it were possible to make any piece of gear literally look like any other piece of gear of the same type, and shaders should be free to reacquire and apply.
---
* **Weapons:** The weapon systems either needs to be changed to the above or reverted to before the 2.0 patch because PvP is completely broken!
---
* **Artifact Power:** Needs to be completely removed from the game because it gives us a false sense of capability. Meaning, even though it increases our survivability, it does nothing for the amount of damage we deal.
---
* **Tooltips:** Are misleading and need to be more accurate instead of extremely confusing and obnoxious.
---
* **Items:** Quests, quest items, pursuits, and so on need to be organized a ton better as everything is currently jumbled together and it can be very difficult to find anything and keep track of what you're doing.

Jeez how bad is that hacker
---
Don‚Äôt forget the not flamethrower a new exotic weapon
---
Many times.
---
Yes.
---
You could make a new character specifically to do that quest chain.
---
Imagine having the ability to hack unlimited power ammo and you choose to use the coil
---
If you don‚Äôt end your tower trip with a suicide then something‚Äôs wrong with you
---
To bad they nerfed it into the ground with sk though. Used to use mine all the time as well.
---
maybe they will do a better job in Destiny 3 and give us more variants i hope....
---
Ikr
---
No it totally did, stadia is broken and stupid.
---
In the 2 years that i have played i have never found a single exotic engram. Is there something you can do to get a higher chance at an exotic engram?
---
It should still come up. I did the mission 3 years ago and still had the quest appear when I got back on this year. Maybe I accidentally did something without knowing it?
---
I supposed I could do it as my Titan, but if I do so, will it still count towards my 'arsenal of oddities' quest if I transfer it to my hunter with the vault .
---
He was really bad but his teammates were worse
---
I can't seem to find a way of replaying it
---
Ikr any lmg would have been better than the coil
---
You can't it won't let you buy anything over a thousand from the store iirc
---
No. You need the DDE to get everything.
---
I don't know what did this, I don't know why you did this, I don't know how you do this. But thank you for doing this.
---
Here‚Äôs how I wound up in clans. 
---
1. I believe I was specifically looking for a clan. I found the all female clan and joined them for a while. When I got kicked...
---
2. I was without a clan for a while. I was on LFG looking for something and saw a prestige spire. No one was doing prestige spire and I still needed the catalyst. I posted interested and got into the group. It was five clan members and me. I got the catalyst out of the first chest and kept playing to help them out. Wound up getting my first actual clear of prestige with them. I liked them, they liked me, so I joined their clan. It‚Äôs been pretty great so far. They‚Äôre definitely helpful and I like to help them out. 
---
So you can kinda meet a clan anywhere. r/fireteams might be a place to start. The PC players I‚Äôve heard have a massive discord.
---
I dont know. Why are you?
---
You might be able to reacquire the quest from Sloane?
---
Seems like my buddy had to redo the quest line because he did the same thing.
---
Delete the app and reinstall.
---
This is just another day for me 
---
My clan has a Levi them week this week 
---
But with cosmo spilling coffee on the servers again we weren‚Äôt able to do eater of worlds
---
that looks epic
---
No, again youve got it backwards. The good players arent the toxic ones 9/10. Its usually the bad players at the bottom rung who think they belong at legend with their awful loadouts.
---
I Thought I was crazy !
---
All the houses had different colors and symbols, Variks was the last of the House of Judgment I believe. And there's lore on one gun in Destiny 2, believe it might be the misfit, that says the time of houses is over and that must put aside their differences is they are to survive.
---
Guys remember in last wish to shoot the eyes for extra damage against riven works every time

Welcome to cooking with mama levante, today we'll show you how to make hive worm salad
---
Coil? Really?
---
Ya
---
I can't remember when but a big destiny youtuber said it durring forsaken. I may be wrong and miss informed so take it with a grain of salt.
---
Fair enough.
---
Thats the thing you shouldnt need to have a mountain top + recluse combo to do good, but because thats what everyone uses the crucible becomes toxic because everyone thinks they need them.
---
It still a machine of the hive. Alright, I will get on it
---
Blue legion!
---
You dont. You can run mountain top/recluse
---
Dustrock/not forgotten
---
Any 540 pulse/erentil
---
Literally any primary you enjoy/literally any special ammo secondary.
---
The same as the previous but reversed slots.
---
Any sniper as long as you can hit shots. 
---
And depending on your platform, even more combos open up.
---
Seems like someone hasn‚Äôt read the patch notes. Top tree dawnblade and wings of sacred dawn will most likely be really strong next season
---
Message me if you‚Äôre on PC I‚Äôll do it with you 
---
I need it too
---
Capes fit hunters more than titans imo
---
Might wanna clean your lens there pal. Got a couple of specks.
---
Allow warlocks to remove cloak there
---
Phone slipped and mud got on it.
---
Scene:Anchorman 2
---
Edit: me
---
log out from settings and then log back in
---
This week's NF Ordeal is particularly hard, you need the right loadout to beat it.
---
But it still used to be in the game
---
My clan calls its the shadow realm too. Or Big Daddys Calus' Suck Room
---
Looks like someone messed up the cheese badly and matched your team instead and pulled out in time for only your team to load in. Super common to happen if you play late at night.
---
As I said, I don't have a problem doing these solo, using recluse and Izanagi. I find it kinda easy too. I don't know what you are struggling on but couldn't be that hard.
---
Ima have to say Leviathans breath
---
Anything u like with a good Roll. I would Say Spare ration or duke or kindled orchid or Optative
---
I wish iron banner gave you Cape instead
---
That's a good point actually. Just pouring it into a mold would be kind of underwhelming. I am actually really excited to see what is in there. SIVA smoothie anyone?
---
For some reason tonight its down. But usually works perfectly, try tomorrow. U Can also use the companion app of Bungie or their website to find a group.
---
I mean, who doesn‚Äôt?
---
Are u doing 100k points every week? alone?
---
we dont have izanagis yet... since one of our members doesnt have forsaken and we havent done last queststep yet...
---
Yeah draw time aside 1 tap from anywhere is great and it does sweet prime evil dps. Xeno has potential if it had deeper reserves and they buff damage.
---
My first exotic was fighting lion
---
Who is Calus?
---
Ah yes the siege dancers. The ones from just outside Rubicon?
---
Typical scrubs
---
Is it for a few seconds? Its probably not a glitch its probably lag either on your end or on your the server.
---
That melee range tho jeez
---
It would‚Äôve been funny maybe if he didn‚Äôt cause it. It was just annoying imo. Same as Ava acting like she wasn‚Äôt at fault for Mayas death and getting mad at Lilith.
---
Exotics shouldn‚Äôt have elemental affinity. Most of them are already made to fit a specific purpose, what‚Äôs the point of restricting that even further?
---
As u Say earlier and what i told u is to have the correct gear. U need a good Energy ammo weapons, its recommanded with range. Sniper, fusion rifle, heavy Grenade launcher or Machine gun. Shotgun is risky
---
Let‚Äôs not.
---
What do you mean? He clearly loves you
---
Lets do.
---
lasts about 1-3 minutes.
---
Don‚Äôt you guys just love OEM hahahahaha kill me
---
No no really. Let‚Äôs not. ;)
---
I've said it before, I'll say it again: presence of Cayde tribute ramen recipe = day 1 buy (for me).
---
Crouch shooting in this game is overrated when the aim assist makes it practically useless
---
More Gambit
---
But like really, let's do it. ;)
---
That had to of been a pain in the assorted make it look that clean so good job üëç
---
I‚Äôm gonna give it a hard pass.
---
Do you need help? Are you traumatized about what you saw?
---
Waaat, it's the Zavala voice actor, so atleast loosly related ü§™
---
Seems legit,
---
I also have work.
---
Banana, the potassium mind
---
I know who he is, it's just not related to the game in any way. I hope you can understand this.
---
Exactly like my first fireteam in GoS.
---
Where does it ever say he was an arcstrider? I've never seen this mentioned referenced or written anywhere and Googles coming up with a blank
---
Saw the title and knew exactly what was about to go down
---
Hehe, not my post, I was just joking about it :)
---
He is funny in [corporate ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_(TV_series))

cheers bro, im just new to d2

I get it that a group would make it go quicker - really not in my best interest or the randoms that would be with me. I‚Äôm prone to more mistakes and generally just fucking everything up.

---
Unlucky , I got it on 5th run
