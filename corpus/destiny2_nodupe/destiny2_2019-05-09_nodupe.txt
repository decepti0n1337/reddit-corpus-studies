I’ve got my shit together at around the fifth attempt (I reached the boss room). Adds were not so tough but fuck the shields. Last battle turrets were to beefy
---
---
---
I want that chest piece
---
But it's technically not. That's my point. They say it's free for everyone but not everyone can shell out the $40 DLC (forsaken) you need to get to a reasonable power level to get through zero hour.
---
Just walk in there and grab it.
---
 Xbox
---
Tbh this is exactly as intended. It's so people will chase it. It's so people who haven't gotten the season pass will cave just to reach 700pl. It's a lure
---

---
In a month or so after the hype is gone and the bitching gets louder it will be brought in line with other weapons.
---
without the timer it would be extremely easy.

Professor Layton is the best DS game (besides mario kart) to ever exist.
---
Change my mind

Also vaccines don’t cover every disease, some kids who are very sick and have a weak immune system could be killed by anti vaccination people
---
I watched 1 video and made it through my second time with a couple friends that almost two-manned it.
---
Damn that's unlucky, and could someone help me out with this?
---
Update: I played a few matches with sweaty friends and just ended up getting it!
---
Prospector is def more flexible. Void rockets with tractor cannon is still as good as ever though
---
5x bad omen with cluster +1 tractor is strong as hell.
---
When you have the Titan quest line finished, you unlock it.
---
But I have no quests available on Titan
---
Have ... have you run scan and repair from inside battle net?
---
I, too, am curious.  Ive been struggling to find a way for this controllers sensitivity and dead zone settings to match the DS4.  I really like this controller, but if I can't figure this out, I am going to have to return it. I seem to be unable to find any information related to the Revolution Unlimited, no matter where I look online.
---
I second this.
---
ESPECIALLY if you are on PC.
---
No you don’t. Hit fabled in the season, finish The rest in the same season and you’re fine.
---
Check Sloane.

This isn't an LFG sub.

Happy cake day! May you have no Trevors today
---
I know. Still needed help. Thanks
---
I haven't found that on the app or anywhere on my PC. Do you know where it is
---
Nope.
---
Rule 6.
---
They got nerfed finally? Good news!
---
As a fellow Hunter main, I say Titan. The jump isn’t as frustrating and the Supers feel more fun than Warlock.
---
I really isn’t enjoy playing my Warlock alt, but have really enjoyed Titan.
---
It's just preference, they both have their ups and downs.
---
Pros of Warlocks:
---
Warlocks have their Novas with high damage and with Skull of Dire makes it unbelievably good. 
---
They have Supernova Grenade with middle tree Voidwalker
---
They have their Arc Web Stormcaller which allows add clearance easy as hell.
---
They have Chaos Reach which is disgusting with Geomags in Gambit.
---
They have well of radiance which boosts damage and healing.
---
They have a dash with Top tree Sunsinger which is okay in crucible but not the best. 
---
Cons: they don't have that much resilience against a lot of enemies, so you'd need to pick your timing in high power level zones.
---
To me, the jump doesn't feel as good as Titans and Hunter but that's because I enjoy controllable fast paced action.
---
Pros of Titans:
---
They have Melting point with insane damage with the hammers for adds and bosses. That paired with a well or an empowering rift makes it awesome.
---
They have Burning Maul which their melee is a throwing hammer that you can pick up once dropped on the ground.
---
They have sunspots which causes damage in a small radius once thrown a hammer in that spot.
---
Sentinels have good damage overall against ads and the middle tree is able to get a sort of empowerment like Well of radiance.
---
Thundercrash stuns bosses and is an okay ad super, but bottom tree striker is much better for ads. 
---
Cons: not so great on endgame content but to clear ads, their boss damage isn't as good and comes from the guns mainly, Melting point is great but it's not always available.
---
Yea I get you, Friday after 7:30 is that good?
---
It’s supposed to change color based on your equipped subclass
---
Viruses mutate more easily in hosts they can survive in, essentially allowing the virus or disease to potentially overcome the vaccine. That’s the way a virus is still potentially dangerous to a vaccinated person.
---
is this an ornament on it or is your game on colorblind? i haven't gotten the time to run the mission yet and i haven't seen if any ornaments are available.  if it is, can you perhaps link a screenshot so i can get a better view?
---
Shots fired... Literally.
---
The nerf made the super balanced, and I was abusing spectral with gwisin all the time before.
---
This looks amazing! I can't tattoo all your work on me though 😢
---
Big shrug my dude. Doesn't change my core point but I'll edit just for you
---
Thanks! In general, is the Annual Pass content worth it for a new/novice/casual player or would Forsaken be sufficient?
---
You don't know true fear if you havent been chased by TR3-VR

---
He is actually all the Titan classes rolled into one 😂😂
---
Alright I like your energy, you seem much smarter than the previous, he was even liking his own comments which is low key small dick energy lol. Now I've never once said this was a problem and that's where your comment begins to fail because you accidentally create a strawman argument. You start off with an opinion based point. Then you go off with games copying for decades which basically says "Yes fortnite copies but other games do it" (weak justification) (I also want that source baby) There were thousands of historical warriors. For honors warriors are NOT canon and are made up with pieces of historical facts. Completely shuts that down. They were hundreds of unique solder designs. Fortnite has Viking and especially samurai skins that look exactly the same. (Weak justification pt 2) The raven skin is based off a crow, duh. But you're telling me that these crow skins from games (I can only say games because you have no source) all look the exact same with the same color, aesthetic all because it's mystic (weak justification pt 3) Mystics can form and Many colors. Especially in a video game. But let's stop with opinions alright.
---
No one's mourning the loss of Spectral.. Because it was worse than Nova Warp. We just didn't see it because Nova Warp was worse.
---
Most of the pc stuff is actually here on DTG. It's honestly a good switch if you have the time to regrind everything. And as mentioned by u/FreaksInSneaks , they make it easy to buy bundles.
---
Uhhhhh how about they fix the bug where if you're in the path of a bullet fired from a gun and it hits you YOU TAKE DAMAGE OR IT KILLS YOU?! How is no one talking about this?! RIDICULOUS
---
Ah ok, I see your point now!
---
How often do you play?
---
Two whole pants with loads of love
---
If you do not own Forsaken, there are nightfalls. If you do not have one already, get a Five of Swords card from Xur that will allow you to put modifiers on nightfalls to customize the difficulty. 
---
If you own Forsaken, Shattered Throne. It is available every 3 weeks and is intermediate in difficulty between a strike and a raid. It is soloable. The Whisper is also soloable, but very difficult. You can enter it even if you only own the base game, but you cannot deal damage to the enemies unless you are power level 380-ish.
---
Good luck on the grind! It's a lot easier this season for whatever reason. I don't know if it's all the solo's or what but it's pretty easy if you are somewhat good
---
Don’t do it, i’m a virgin
---
We call it Robot Pyramid Head
---
Bruh I havent played this since osiris dlc and havent done the raid lol. All my people are 330ish probably with meh gear. The fuck should I go do? Continue with the story or just kinda farm or whatever xD?
---
Lol this made my day.  Stupid walls always hurting you if you crash into them at high speeds.  O and don't forget about the ground killing you when you fall from to high.  O  o o and those dam bullets hurting you when they hit you.
---
The catalyst works the same way as the Whisper catalyst, where you need to complete the heroic version to obtain it and then complete it five (could be four if you get 20% with the catalyst right away) times to completely unlock it.
---
I’ve seen endgame and I had no idea what this picture was from until I read this, and now I can see.
---
I don't think it'll be patched out. People have been doing this for ages to get infinite time on whisper and anything else with a timer.
---
Uhm, but they stay!?
---
Those helmet ornaments were just made for a 3 week event. Why chase after them if they expire anyway?
---
That's the whole point. And there are still people defending it. Wtf
---
It’s the death robot in Zero hour
---
These outbreak memes are fantastic lmao
---
Yah but like fusk that
---
That from dodging while the supers active its a part of toptree
---
I want to say Galaxy Quest, but I can’t be certain. Also who’s the actor, because he looks so familiar but just out of reach.
---
Nice job lol. Its really good lol. the lol shading is lol amazing
---
Maybe #endgame spoiler in title next time, saw the spoiler tag and didn’t care because destiny, but haven’t seen the movie yet.
---
We don’t know
---
Trevor will scare you into cardiac arrest
---
How is your gun yellow?
---
And Trevor the death roomba
---
It’s rumoured to be where Benedict 44 will relocate to next season
---
*demonic roomba noises*
---
It’s not 60 FPS on console even with the one x. 
---
It’s locked at 30, even though many think the X is capable of 60fps but they wants parity with the weaker PS4 Pro because of the Sony deal. 
---
Only place to play Destiny at 60fps+ is PC.
---
doomba\*
---
Are you kidding, this is a celebration for everyone that doesn’t uses a hand cannon
---
when will season 7 begin?
---
i've left destiny a few weeks after warmind and i wanted to play it again for the new season
---
They went for a more subtle approach to that. Namely the name of the whole quest line "The enemy of my enemy" most of the time you'd hear people saying is my friend through mutual hatred of one person i.e us, Petra and spider against Uldren. Just at the fight ghost asks if we like the fallen or the hive more as well so it's sort of there but not really.
---
I remember the winter snow arena
---
CLAP-TREVOR, the one who tenderizes to dust
---
Luckily when I ran it, I never got to see it.
---
It does, but you need to shoot 3 mags into him before jumping on the plate so everyone has nanites stacked. Can’t do this on every boss
---
On light.gg u can see all the catalysts they're putting in the game I have a pic of it
---
You were so worried about if you could that you never considered if you should.
---
Gratuitous Reload porn!
---
Same thing just happened to me...
---
Bruh.
---
Gimme you exotics rng on those drop rates
---
People never want to blame themselves for being "bad" at something they cherish, hence they will blame the gun. I think OP is from PC, like myself, and on PC it is a much different scenario. I dont know how easy it is to use NF or Luna on console, but if the problem lies on console, maybe fix the recoil on console? It is disheartening to see a pinnacle weapon be nerfed, and not because that gun is going to be mid tier, but because now I know for the future of pinnacle weapons, they are subject to change. Making them not worth my time, and being the only reason I still play destiny is for PVP, that ruins it a bit. It's a shame people who play crucible 5 matches a week can shout and be heard, but not the people who play 50+ matches a week

Here ya go
---
This idea is amazing! - Shaxx
---
riven and insurrection prime have both been 1 phased by outbreak, so yeah...
---
Puppies?
---
That bit in the Zavala trailer where Zavala and Saladin are using weapons to fight the Fallen and then Shaxx, completely unarmed, punches a Fallen once, so hard that it kills him was awesome. Also, Shaxx is huge.
---
I just wanna play as a Fallen/Eliksni on the next Destiny game plz
---
I got one I had never heard from the Drifter earlier tonight. I sent a large blocker and he said softly "you just sent a large Taken to the other side. You're a bad person."
---
Ive got one with sureshot, rapidhit, ricoche and rampage with a range MW. The range is allmost the same as the damage.
---
Its a glitch. Will not unlock for alternative character. Nothing to do with transfering the gun. Happen to me too. Sux
---
Mithrax appears to be a stealth captain, i assume he snuck in there, also seeing how he is hiding in a basement. And yeah, when we spared him on titan he remembered us and changed his ways, now fighting for guardians.
---
All hail Mithrax, rat king and kell of the House of Light
---
I loved it even after Forsaken came out, it was my go-to gun for both pvp and pve.  Then a couple of weeks ago I random-rolled one from Banshee that had Armor-Piercing/Steady Rounds, Under Pressure and Kill Clip.  And masterwork set to Range.  There is a god and he works at Hakke.
---
I do have a few questions as to what would be the best mod to put on it, or which sights and other things would be best.
---
In the first line of Weapon Perks (Left most) it has
---
       1. Fastdraw HCS - Greatly increases Handling Speed &amp; Slightly Increases Stability
---
       2. Truesight HCS - Slightly increases range, Slightly increases Stability, &amp; Slightly increases handling speed
---
       3.  Hitmark HCS - Slightly increases range
---
In the second line of weapon Perks it has 
---
       1. Outlaw - "Precision kills greatly decrease reload time" (for anyone that may not know off the top of their head) 
---
In the third line of weapon perks it has
---
       1. Alloy Mag - "Faster reloads when magazine is empty"
---
       2. Armor Piercing Rounds - "Rounds cause extra damage to enemy combatants' shield and overpenetrate  targets" ,  It also slightly increases Range
---
       3. High-Caliber Rounds - "Shots from this weapon knock the target back farther" also Slightly increases Range
---
In the 4th line of weapon perks It has 
---
       Rampage - "Kills with this weapon temporarily grant increased damage. Stacks 3 times."
---
Which of these would be best for general use. The masterwork is for stability which will be maxed soon.
---
What Weapon mod would be best?
---
Thanks for the apology. Wasn’t trying to get out of hand with this.
---
Sounds pretty good.
---
Did you by chance see my comment about thoughts and questions on the weapon?
---
Because a vision softly creeping

u/ageofalexi
---
Thorn was the AP exotic quest and outbreak is the free one.
---
¡GOOOOOOOOOAL!
---
*Running through the halls flipping the switches* "Wee woo... Wee woo..."
---
*TR3-VR turns the corner* WEE WOO WEE WOO
---
OH GOD OH FUCK
---
Thats the perk of being subbed to both I guess lol
---
And even then, destinythegame doesnt allow images
---
That would be an awesome pin!
---
Thunderlord catalyst when?
---
Goin for the other two on the weekend, i'm pretty nervous :D
---
I'm betting it's bugged. Which is entirely in line with Bungo lol
---
Good luck with that!
---
If only there was some way to read announcements saying when there will be maintenance
---
Ay, love your artwork! You always make Myelin’s videos even better with your great art!
---
A friend of mine had the same problem on all his characters, so he noticed that he had not finished all the quests available on Titan and as soon as he had them done the door unlocked. Not sure if that’s the problem, but it worked for him
---
Whisper works this way too! You can enter and look around on any character, but to complete it you need to either be at the appropriate power level to damage the enemies, or be carried by one or two people who are.
---
Yes
---
Nope, same character, on my owm
---
Keep it secret. Keep it safe.
---
And then there are people who learn the games physics instead of blaming them, that shit don’t happen to everyone.
---
Nice
---
this would actually be fucking horrible
---
No you can still get it. Whether or not you're a heartless killer or a kind guardian, Mithrax will still appear and allow the quest to continue
---
What king you eat? Jk. No you are fine.
---
And that's the Peter panda dance 😁
---
But it says the door is locked to get the quest started
---
I love that meme
---
Im getting the annual pass+forsaken combo later today if that gives you any incentive to get it
---
The tether is just a bonus because it suppresses the shielding effect and generates bonus orbs for more supers. Obviously there is not one right way to do it!
---
I fucking screamed the first time i saw trevor, i thought he was a big fallen captain chasing me with a red stick. Absolutely horrifying.
---
I can only give you my opinion, and I don’t know where your values lie. I’ve bought it twice now, (one for PS4 one for PC) I’ll tell you first hand that if you’re not up for grinding for good rolls on weapons and armor you won’t really enjoy Black Armory (I actually loved it), If you don’t like gambit or the plight of bad rng for the Gambit prime weapons, you won’t like Season of the Drifter. Lastly, if all those are untrue, If you’re not an avid raider or like to do endgame content, you won’t like Penumbra. These are all generalizations and you should take them with a grain of salt. I wholeheartedly think the dlcs are worth $35 especially for all the time I’ve put into it. The rest is up to you. Good luck!
---
The reason we need random-rolled y1 armor
---
YouTube it man
---
Yes, we completed it
---
Same. I love his "bad guy" lines. Siding with him (even though hes a hard core liar and i honestly feel most of what he says to us is a complete lie) was still a no brainier for me.
---
Practice the maze, Practice the maze, Practice the maze.
---
There is nothing complicated about shooty bang bang, but that maze KILLS your time
---
Great,  nice clutch. Enjoy the weapon
---
I went up against a 4-stack using perfecteds in comp, they got spanked. Our team was a mixture of hand cannons, Pulse rifles, shotguns, and 1 sniper. 
---
I don’t this gun is OP at all, i think getting a double kill off Siva swarms is a novelty that happens so infrequently that it isn’t worth running...cause as a pulse rifle alone, it isn’t even that hot.
---
I think the gun is fine PvE wise, even though you can melt a boss with a squad or Rat Kong’s  doesn’t mean people wanna run rat king for all PvE activities. Same with this gun.
---
Just get them now and infuse once you get higher
---
I like HardLight. it does the same thing borealis will do, but with primary ammo.
---
If you have a mountaintop it is basically essential.
---
Machine gun heavies are the way to go. One person can run a Whisper for tanks and boss dps.
---
PRACTICE. THAT. MAZE. !!!
---
You don’t need to do the heroic version, you can just do the normal version
---
It doesn't really matter. You can just infuse them once you get to 700, and with exotic weapons you can easily pull a new one from your collections that will only be 20 light levels below your current level.
---
I actually already had mine+catalyst. This was for a Clan mate. No joke, at about a minute left. I mentioned the time and how we probably wouldn't get it. To which my clan mate replies "I've seen crazier S*** Happen" 00:00 Victory
---
The mission is not required at all, you can get to the area on Patrol.
---
Hunter jump has the most precise timings and the best overall height with stompees. It combines the best things about titan jump and warlock glide.
---
The thing has a built in aim bot. You dont have to aim at the head to get crits. You can aim at the waist, shoulder, left or right of head and the rounds go straight to the head. It seems bugged.
---
With that said....it doesnt need a nerf. Its frustrating to die to because of the lack of a need to know how to aim but leave it as is just fix the guaranteed crits on it.
---
They all say you need one person but that didn’t work and they talk about the version of it back when it would sit in your primaries
---
It may have alot of aim assist, but blast furnace has statistically alot more. It's not very good in PvP and playing against it is a breeze even when it has a clear advantage for range.
---
“Support”
---
Protocol is better don’t @ me
---
What about that Thrall lurking in a dark corner in the D1 Cosmodrome? My underleveled friend and I found that horrifying, especially since ww couldn’t do damage...
---
&gt; [I'm provably mistaken, and I don't want to acknowledge that, so I'm fleeing from confronting my own ignorance.]
