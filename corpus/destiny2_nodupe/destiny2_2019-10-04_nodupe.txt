---
You mean rediquette?
---
Oh yeah, if it‚Äôs a choice between the two then 100% Shadowkeep then, if only because it‚Äôs the ‚Äúcurrent‚Äù content. Plus, between Shadowkeep, season of the undying, and the free content, you can get a good gun from pretty much every major weapon archetype
---
Ouch
---
If that were a thing I'd totally go back in time and grind those boring Faction Rallies and Iron Banner.
---
I hope they add an exotic version I loved this gun in D1
---
Heard she was gonna go hit up Tyrone and Jerome after that
---
Lol wtf?!
---
https://imgur.com/YaMDxjR.jpg
---
we should be able to do this where everybody could finish the boss as it is about to die
---
except the time I put in
---
I would delete the game then redownload it.
---
Doesn't look good
---
Im in a similar situation, I need to buy forsaken on steam :(
---
I'm always disappointed but I always comeback lol

I tried. Didnt work.
---
You should save them untill you get to the cap, and infuse your bests weapons and armor, a common mistake is to use them before that.
---
Congrats, the thing is a damn beast. Where did it drop from?
---
U can repurchase the pinnacles from their respective vendor. E.g Zavala for loaded question, Shaxx for recluse, drifter for hush etc. Not sure if they come as masterworks but the same perks
---
couldn't agree more.
---
The only thing that disappoints me is that &gt;!the dead arnt actually dead they're some kinda energy that plays on our minds like a drug!&lt;
---
Lol same here but I waited several months before I caved in to get forsaken but man like there is no story /cut scenes in this game . What not connection was cayde-6 and they killed him lol I‚Äôm sure they did it to make ppl come back but man shadowkeep feels so empty
---
Buy gunsmith bounties &amp; complete them all every day
---
season pass content will not transfer between accounts. base shadowkeep dlc will but season of the undying and beyond do not.
---
It seems I have a lot (not a ton) and I wanna be able to use them, and I have no money as of right now either :(
---
Your characters are still there. Cross save doesn't overwrite them. You can turn off cross save and they will be playable again on your Xbox. 
---
HOWEVER, you will have to wait 90 days to set up cross save again.
---
edit: from the FAQ
---
Can I disable Cross Save once I‚Äôve enabled it?
---
Cross Save is intended to be a one-time action, **but we realize there may be cases in which you want to visit the characters you left behind**. Once Cross Save has been disabled, you will have access to your original characters on each platform. **There is a 90-day wait to re-enable the feature.** This policy exists to discourage activity like account recoveries by other players.
---
You would get access to the Forsaken campaign, so the story missions. You would also gain access to the raid that came with Forsaken, and also any exotic quest lines that were introduced in Forsaken.
---
 Yeah man I‚Äôm honestly tired of fighting the same enemies same bosses and everything. Guess on the new expansion or destiny 3 we will be fighting Crotas wife or something
---
Got perfect score triumph first try üòé
---
They did a ban wave today towards people using aimbots or aim cheats. Anything you have that could‚Äôve triggered that?
---
D2 through Warmind are now free, so you get two expansions, I guess
---
Contact support and they'll tell you why. No one on here can with the information you just gave.
---
none
---
How long did it take? I‚Äôve been waiting two weeks for mine :(
---
Did u actually finish allll of the campaign in each dlc? Every mission? Cos unless u did it will make u redo all of it (yes it‚Äôs stupid)
---
Pretty sure new characters are bumped to 750 a well. And most of the games content is the end game, that's what most players are there for. You can still replay the campaigns by talking to holiday in the tower.
---
I‚Äôm honestly not really sure, so I‚Äôd assume it‚Äôs a random drop
---
Borderlands has no endgame and essentially you can either download saves with all the legendary gear or sit there killing a boss every thirty seconds for hours.
---
It sounds bad to say "just cheat" but borderlands endgame is so boring and unchallenging it's really not.
---
You‚Äôll need to start Forsaken from the beginning. Launch the mission Last Call on the Tangled Shore.
---
üò≥
---
I actually like it. Especially on the moon. Moon‚Äôs haunted.
---
Weird. I had it installed on HDD and SSD and sometimes load times were super fast and the other cases super slow (like 2min).
---
Possibly but I‚Äôd rather just have it there
---
That's what we call the double whammy!
---
I have the same issue. Just to be clear, did you manage to finish the quest? i've done Bergusia 4 times now, but to no avail..
---
This actually funny
---
For me it was when I did my first public event on the moon in D2 and it end up being a "Defend the Warsat". 
---
I felt a Rage build up inside me, remembering the countless hours I spent on the moon in D1 waiting for the warsat. So I could get the Sleeper Simulant...
---
Meanwhile somebody with the name PlsDontFuckTheLoli didn't get censored for me
---
Apparently. Thats atleast what I heard from a lot of people. Right now you can access the Bergusia forge through the EDZ map, but for example you can't access the Volundr forge right now.
---
Reply to the edit: no problem, glad to show some love for a fellow guardian!
---
Wow. That‚Äôs whack.
---
Load times on SSD are amazing. Definitely transfer it over. It will also be one of those things you‚Äôll start to notice right away in strikes,playing with friends etc when you‚Äôre the first person to load in for like 20/30 seconds. You end up going wtf is happening here, then remembering that you are indeed speed.
---
At first I didnt even think that was the end, there was no resolution or anything . I'm very disappointed
---
Long time Destiny 2 player, was close to level cap before bumping to 750. But I have a dumb and noob question:
---
What happened to the dailies?
---
I made the switch to from PC old launcher to Steam, and now I don't seem any daily challenges?
---
But dont you ever spring clean your friends list and remove all the people you dont interact with any more.
---
If I start now on Steam have I missed any Destiny 2 story content that I could never play through or can I still go through all of it?  Also, is there a way to know what order I should go through content if I want to do it in order?
---
Nope, never need to. It's also kinda nice to see someone on my friends list that I havent talked to in a few years playing some other game I have, and be able to message them to see if they want to play
---
What roll did you get?
---
Yeah what the point playing essentially a story game with a story to rival anthems story I don‚Äôt under stand all the positive reviews that game got it worst the worst game I‚Äôve bought in years.
---
Yeah still top tier they had to nerf master of arms because of the flat damage increase to Smg‚Äôs if they didn‚Äôt it would have been ridiculous
---
Forsaken was last year's expansion.
---
alright i watched a video where it explained the events of all d1 but one question still remains.
---
Who was that exo lady who litterally told me that she "didn't have time to explain why she didn't have time to explain".
---
she was litterally the embodyment of "I must go my planet needs me"
---
And Shadowkeep?
---
Might be your graphics settings
---
We won lol
---
Just came out this week.
---
you realise there are two different places to put it, right? 
---
Motherboard = Bad.
---
GPU = Good
---
I just checked and my Solstice armor has better or comparable stats than my other 2.0 armor I've collected so far, so I really sont know what you mean.
---
Bolt caster was so much fun against thrall tho!
---
I‚Äôm close behind you, I have like almost 30 hours already
---
Try looking up YouTube videos like cammycakes, destiny fun police, cool guy and fall out plays. They have reviews of pretty good guns and just YouTube top 10 destiny guns and you should get results. As far as the armor, it‚Äôs hard to say rn cuz everything is still new.
---
That's nice and sexy
---
Pve Shards of galanor and prospector 
---
Pvp stompies and a good pulse rifle and shootgun 
---
If you like melee try top tree arcstrider and liar hand shake
---
Exit strategy? Seems like a good gun but I doubt it can beat recluse for usefulness
---
Look up the "LOOT CAVE" too
---
The good ol days when a purple engram would be a blue if you're lucky
---
All gone, Steam is worldwide, no more switching to NA for lfg
---
Nice! Did you unlock yours yet? If so, does the catalyst make the weapon any good?
---
Sweet. My titan and warlock are original from D1 i deleted my hunter at the beginning of D2 out of frustration. But later made a new one out of respect for Cayde.
---
I have yet to get stompees and I‚Äôve been playing since year one season 1üò§
---
We need an alien ghost. Area 51 shell.
---
Bungie is usually pretty cool about people reproducing replicas and stuff. But selling them could be pushing the line. Just a heads up. (Ps if you do sell them do it  Discreetly)
---
ummm my character is like 600 something  [https://gyazo.com/72b78b997184be8cb3a4f7aba64cf79d](https://gyazo.com/72b78b997184be8cb3a4f7aba64cf79d)  and I cant even kill anything or do damage
---
No the best smg will be the one that is consistently the most effective and that is definitely recluse. The only smgs that can even compete are all exotic and even then they aren‚Äôt as good (barring riskrunner situations)
---
I‚Äôm glad they are just cosmetics, although the exotic hand cannon does drop later in it. I still disagree with it. Just another way for them to get my money
---
Bought it on commission
---
Underdog air assault
---
 still find players closer to you and then move to other regions?
---
SAME!!  i was like "NO FUCKING WAY!! ALL THIS TIME!!??? HERE!???"
---
F
---
What platform
---
üëåüèΩüëåüèΩ
---
This one was sold for $200 but for $225 it comes in a nice hard shell pistol case.
---
Xbox one
---
Literally hundreds of posts
---
This one was sold for $200
---
Eh, I‚Äôd dismantle it and make a new one
---
I‚Äôd recommend lfg for Sherpa run initially for the raids you want or clan recruiting sites
---
lfg is really cool, most folks are decent and helpful
---
Ok...
---
Same. ‚ÄúOh cool shi- WHAT HE HELL?‚Äù
---
I played D1, I remember that shit lol, just new to D2
---
Your friend needs to buy forsaken to do LW, SotP, and CoS.
---
I didn‚Äôt even truly know what I was doing when I killed him tbh, I was just tryna have fun
---
Is it good? I haven't gotten a God roll machine gun yet
---
Might as well get it out of the way ASAP
---
They only do a wipe every 6 months or so. You just have to wait a month then they wont block it. I actually think it‚Äôs the people who sell the official merch.
---
EP shotgun, Midnight Coup, Spare Rations, Blast Furnace, Bygones, Inaugural Address, Threat Level, Recluse, Mountaintop, Loaded Question (I don't know if you are able to get the quest for it now a days), Hammerhead, 150rpm Grenade Launcher with Spike Grenades perk, one-two-punch shotgun
---
Eris is one of the big reasons I was excited for this DLC. Eris morn is a bad ass. She doesn‚Äôt have a ghost anymore so she can‚Äôt come back from death and she still went to scout the moon by herself.
---
To be fair the hive have always been scary I hate going to dark deep places and I‚Äôm sure my guardian does too.
---
It‚Äôs the new strike that released with shadowkeep.
---
Same here.
---
I imagine the hive are taking notes.  "All we need to do is lead them under a tank.  Repeatedly."
---
Me on PC too, my nickname is GogetaSR
---
I got it without even playing it.
---
Yeah you could. Everything is handed out for free, except the campaign and maybe some minor things. If you don't care for the campaign, just skip it.
---
Dreaming City for me
---
Damn that sucks. Well when xur come tomorrow go buy one of his faded engram. It will drop a exsotic you don't have so do it enough you get them.
---
I have not. about 30% done. I was working on other weapon quests tonight. I don't usually concentrate on one quest and bring it to completion right away. I usually like to let it happen organically.
---
Bro PLEASE use the search bar. It‚Äôs literally the same picture 1000x since Tuesday. 
---
The bunny is like the cats in the dreaming city, you give it a consumable, it gives you blue gear.
---
You lack a small rice cake, you get those from doing stuff on the moon, super low chance.
---
It‚Äôs the internet, blizzard kept their continental servers separated, probably budget reasons, Steam doesn‚Äôt and it works for their other online stuff like GTA V etc
---
Unless you‚Äôre talking about the Asia cheese?? That‚Äôs long gone lol
---
My wife and I are getting ours tomorrow!
---
Sweet! I‚Äôll be farming legendaries tonight
---
Dailies are gone. Only weeklies now. They‚Äôve made a conscious effort to reduce the number of powerful gear sources. There‚Äôs still only a 60 lvl grind though, so you can get through it in a few weeks if you commit
---
A lot
---
After the animation change, Austringer is so much fun to use
---
I have a semi active clan if you would want to join it. I could talk to the leader, but if you're looking for a clan with people to consistently play with then you might wanna try checking r/fireteams. Not that this one isn't active we just usually do our own thing until we plan a raid or something
---
Nice killed that walker and totally missed that. Any way to get back? You can do it on all 3 character seperately, right?
---
Edit; never mind. https://youtu.be/wi45XMhHMI4
---
Exotic weapons will always have the same perks/stats. It won‚Äôt cost an upgrade module to pull from collections though, so it might be worth doing it that way
---
[deleted]
---
Ah, thy
---
Only ended up seing it cause DIM didn't want to give me my Pants back from the Vault and i ended up checking her Inventory before bringing myself to fly to Tower
---
BUT IT'S SHINY AS FUCK AND I'M BLOWING SHIT UP EVERYWHERE
---
Thanks man I will keep a eye out for these what would you rate the breakneck my friend says it's pretty good he also pretty new on the game also tho.
---
It's pretty good! Basically a solar version of Delirium. The different perks combinations are also a neat option to have, Demolitionist is pretty great on a gun like this (:
---
There‚Äôs all kinds of loadout vids on YouTube pretty much same shut as last season
---
It's a lot of fun and fairly powerful, basically turns your auto rifle into a shotgun at the press of a button. Been using it in pve for strikes and story...would I take it into the raid? No.
---
Okay man thanks I'll check them out.
---
Forgot to say you can only do it once a week
---
Not even close bl3 is way better
---
I‚Äôd love to know the answer to this as I‚Äôm in the same boat.
---
You‚Äôre fired.
---
Its on the table in front of the pyramid
---
Always worth it to get forsaken, one of the best dlcs I've ever bought. And from what I've played, shadowkeep is pretty damn good too. It has a lot of elements from the original destiny.
---
I see. Good for you mate. 
---
Was there a specific requirement within the forge, or a specific forge that had to be done.
---
I didn‚Äôt pay for shadowkeep lol
---
Ha. Why don‚Äôt you cry into your sock about it pussy. Calling someone a chump for paying over and over and over for the same game is a lot less insulting than calling someone an illiterate, entitled ‚Äúlittle shit‚Äù. Fucking nerds need to grow tf up.
---
thats even more fucked
---
I'm right here with you. Confused as fuck. I'm trying to get the more tedious introductory content out of the way while people make guides for new players on YouTube or over here.
---
I'm sorry
---
Mine too. I'm here all alone and I still said it out loud
---
Mate, have you never played the game? That‚Äôs the gear you get at the start of the game. You absolute fool
---
There is no such thing as replacing a weapon certain things will be better to do with telescope while others outbreak
---
And yes you should get it, it‚Äôs really easy
---
And bungee support has not responded to me
---
Yeah I just noticed this on a concept artist page and thought man That would be sick. Especially since a similar perk was in d1 ROI
---
Did you buy the deluxe edition of shadowkeep whist owning the season pass? They will refund you silver since the deluxe version gives the prior season pass.
---
Dude craft otherside (season 3, sparrows) or the platinum starlight or qhaterver its called the black amrory ship ... otherside costs 5shards and 7.5k glimmer deconstructs into 5k and 5 shards or just buys random bountied
---
I do matter, and my opinions matter. I called y‚Äôall chumps for acting like I‚Äôm a crazy person for asking a simple question, that you COULDN‚ÄôT ANSWER DIRECTLY. It was, ‚Äúfree this‚Äù, and ‚Äúyou can do this now‚Äù .
---
All I wanted to know is if I seriously had to give these people more money after everything. Fuck yourself kid, you have absolutely no respect, and the destiny servers are the best place for you to live out your life.
---
Well, clearly nobody agrees with you on literally anything you say, considering your account has 0 Karma, so you can shut the fuck up. Also, it took you a day to come up with this? You're fucking stupid. Who says "Why don't you cry into your sock," what are you, 50? Nobody says chump either, you fucking dolt. Grow the fuck up, and get a life
---
Yeah that would dope but you never know it can happen
---
Good point. Thank you. Do you know any good legendary fusion rifles I can use while I'm using outbreak?
---
I just fought that in combative
---
Some players who purchase the Shadowkeep Deluxe Edition may not receive all four Season Passes, but may instead receive 1,000 Silver per unredeemed Season. Players may spend this Silver to purchase future seasons through the Seasons tab in the Director menu.
---
The floating thing didn't have any interaction indicator for me...
---
edit: Yeah, I just checked again right now. The big guy dropped an exotic helmet this time instead of a purple engram but I still can't interact with the forge. Perhaps it's because I'm solo and it knows I can't complete it without a fireteam?
---
It's a Jade rabbit, and if you give it a rice cake, which can be randomly acquired through gameplay, it will give you some of the blue essence thingys
---
You can access the Red War (vanilla Destiny 2), Curse of Osiris, and Warmind story campaigns by speaking to Amanda Holliday in the Tower Hangar. If you own Forsaken, you can start that by selecting the mission Last Call on the Tangled Shore.
---
~~It's a pretty cool Easter egg. It has unfortunately been found before. I believe someone datamind the emblem.~~
---
Wait, this one's different. NVM.
---
So it's a Jade rabbit bunny, sorta like the dreaming city cats, you'll get a chance at "small rice cake" dropping from activities on the moon. You give it to the buddy and it gives you a quest for the gear. This has been found before.
---
I just found this too!! I was about to post about it to see if anyone new what it was
---
No, it's been there since the Collapse, apparently
---
Wow!
---
oh ok whoops lol
---
The New Light quests only serve to introduce you to the game, they're not part of a proper narrative.
---
Huh. I do remember readin that the annual pass for year two comea with foresaken. You might need to get the dlc.
---
Black armory was part of rhe y2 season pass.
---
And it‚Äôs not even the same map, there are soooo many changes
---
Thank God I bought the 35 dollars version of the DLC, I would've rioted if I had bought the Deluxe
---
Thanks, you're the best!
---
I just played crucible or strikes dismantle the items for glimmer and shards and you‚Äôll get xp for your pass
---
A small price to pay for salvation (also fitting considering...y'know...Calus gun)
---
Is it bad in shadowkeep?
---
Ah, I see. Thanks.
---
I don‚Äôt stay on reddit, I have a life. You think I would waste a day on your ass? Not even. Karma don‚Äôt mean shit on a fake platform where no one cares about anything EVER. You‚Äôre not special, and you certainly aren‚Äôt a community driven individual. So this Reddit pride shit you got going, it‚Äôs about as useless as throwing my own words at me with a typed out sarcasm. Eat my ass.
---
I died the same way.
---
Ahhhhh that makes more sense. Thanks bud.
---
I wanted to post this as well, but I kept forgetting
---
Have you ever kicked a cursed thrall into a crowd of enemies and watched them go *kaboom*
---
Ah yes, the Chad Eyasluna
---
Literally just play the game not even lying. Ive been just doing bounties and quests etc and now at 920 light
---
Did the game just give up on its gameplay time warnings? Lol
---
Jesus, no...the best we can get is a lil more then 40k lol
---
The reward was being at the light level we were at and having all the gear, subclasses, Black forges and all the other stuff.
---
Git Gud.
---
Awesome
---
That would be sick
---
Loaded question is by far the best pve legendary fusion
---
I never played destiny 1 but I've latched onto the lore of the destiny universe, actually fighting some central lore baddies that I've never fought is really fun. I thought reckoning Oryx would be all I got but this DLC is amazing!!
---
How‚Äôs your sister?
---
That's some *sweet business*
---
What pass rank are you?
---
What the fuck did I just witness?
---
Hope you learned your lesson kiddo üòâüòâ gotta be a big boy if you wanna play in the big leagues some dayüòâüòâüòâ
---
Aw... I read that New Light players got access to the Black Forge... It let me do the first quest line. That's dumb and rather baity to let me waste all that time running the quest only to not let me get the real reward at the end because I don't have the DLC...
---
You're one sad, pathetic little child. Do you take your anger out on people on the internet because you're too much of a pussy to do it in real life, or is it because nobody ever has or ever will love you? I'm truly dying to know. You're not, in my eyes, or many others, a human being at this point, rather a whimpering fool who thinks they're cool because they were popular in middle school. Grow. The. Fuck. Up
---
I've spent countless hours on the moon farming helium filaments, not even for the sword quests, but in Y1D1 it was just a fun pastime. Me and my two buddies would always patrol the moon for hours searching for chests. I don't even need to look at the map or look up locations for the new quests. This DLC really hit me in the nostalgia.
---
A bullet hose :D
---
I love the freelance playlist. Makes things really easy to get to 2100 for Randy's, and now I'm gonna shoot for legend tonight not forgotten finally
---
They patched it out
---
If you made this a airsoft gun i would buy it so damn fast... XD
---
Who needs right combination of perks when you can self (arc) grenade yourself with Riskrunner
---
How about not playing like a little sissy
---
I think thats borderlands. It's called "transmit" in destiny?
---
Sweet! Thanks! üôÇ
---
Gotcha so as long as I have it unlocked it'll show up there from time to time?
---
They are in game
---
Swash
---
*It was this damn-ass rock!*
---
I love the Michelin's belt
---
Squash
---
Go to Amanda holiday.
---
Yeah its most likely gonna be like those chests on the dreadnought where a yellow bar from an event will drop an item or a buff that lets us activate a special event or something.
---
Hey, extra damage is still extra damage.
---
Quite possibly
---
Any advice on getting clean prints? I keep needing supports for parts like the trigger and those ruin it, also how did you finish this?
---
The note said FIRST failure... Has anyone tried completing a forge THEN letting it fail over and over? I wonder.....
---
No.
---
I can do the quests from the Black Armoury, as well as play Gambit and do his bounties.
---
they already did nerf supers and they‚Äôre fine now tbh, MAYBE 2 per match if you spec into intellect or have armor that grants super energy. the guns are just way too unbalanced for the maps and overall TTK and flow of the game
---
Never got around to trying to solo Croata but saw videos on YouTube that looked fun
---
As long as you have the legendary shards and glimmer for it
---
Ah i see
---
I‚Äôm sorry to disappoint you but I got breakneck at the end of season of opulence, and that was the second time I used it
---
You mean the stupidly op flak build that made everything else irrelevent?
---
I'm 900 power level,what color should that gear be gold or purple,and does it drop or do i have to claim it just so i know? Forward thanks
---
I think it does more damage too
---
Yes, they‚Äôre all included with the forsaken expansion now.
---
Yep.  That and a heaping helping of "Oh, we're doing this now.  OK, Cool.  This is happening, and I'm fime with this happening."
---
Eververse, I don't think it's out yet I was just browsing the collections.
---
Oh nice, thank you !
---
Nice. And thanks! This is the first time I‚Äôve actually been on on my cake day. Good thing I made this reply or I wouldn‚Äôt have known lol.
---
I was at the hellmouth and jumped onto a ledge to find 3 ogres, decided to blast them with a few grenades from my launcher and died in a second because one was a nightmare, and the other two were majors. Went right back to get revenge and learned that they were a ‚Äúhigh valued target ‚Äú
---
DO NOT collect any powerful items before 900
---
Getting the same issue. Something is wrong with loading the character model asset on the Inventory screen. Problem persists from installing the game yesterday.
---
Darkness, yes.  Woke up after the Red War? No.  It's been there all this time, since the Collapse at best.  Which in retrospect explains how factions such as the Hive and the Vex were able to keep such annoyingly close tabs on us.
---
No worries lol I've yet to have my 1st but its 2 days after xmas when I checked lol
---
Yeah I've just started playing after not having done so since like, initial release and everything feels so... disjointed? I have no clue what I'm doing now, why I'm here, or what's going on in general except that I'm bouncing around planets.
---
Haven't used War Rig in a long time(CoO), but I believe its 10% of the clip maximum.
---
Been enjoying the game as I've recently picked it up. Got to 900ish light level, and enjoying Gambit a lot.
---
Got to the synthesizer quest line, and I've been doing some reckoning for any pieces. Specifically reaper.
---
My problem, been completing the reckoning trials, as a warlock, and I've been continuously given Titan pieces? am I really just unlucky and the game wants me to go titan? Or is it a random class draw? I'm at about 8/8 titan pieces and its a bit annoying...
---
Val Ca‚Äôat
---
Looking good guardian!
---
Someone got you an award! looks well deserved
---
Nothing is essential per se, but for raids you do well to go for a heavy grenade launcher with spike grenades for boss dps, a good shotgun or fusion rifle for majors (the IKELOS shotgun or Loaded Question pinnacle fusion rifle are both great for quick damage), and whatever primary weapon you feel most comfortable with. A very good option is the Outbreak Perfected pulse rifle which you get from the Zero Hour mission
---
Afraid not. Although if you have an existing fire team of friends you can do it with them
---
I died the same way, except I was on the top the ship instead and the ship flew up which killed me
---
I had but I did it again somehow, Idk how to help though, maybe bungie support.
---
for warlock, if you have contraverse hold, run those with top tree void walker and vortex grenade amazing boss dmg.
---
Thicc
---
Wait what? How do you get that?
---
Pick up and complete a bounty/mission from Banshee called Pain and Gain, after this you will unlock a new step called Risk/Reward, this will take you to the Divide in the Cosmodrome where the walker public event is basically on constant refresh. Do it 3 times, you should get the rifle, ship, then ghost shell. You can keep doing it too after that and get blue gear that might help you get your light level up if you're not already 900.
---
I should have made my steam name as sth like taken phalanx or so
---
Yep, been using it to power up a new char and it's actually pretty insane how much gear you get.
---
Yeah, you can look it up on YouTube (More Console). He explains how to get there very well.
---
Just a heads up, you can get these back from the ramen shop guy. They‚Äôre free.
---
I‚Äôve been running combo blow + 1-2 punch for this DLC since I got that shotty like literally last week, my god I‚Äôm in love. I‚Äôm drunk with the power of that build lol, no major can stand before my might. I only wish I had Liar‚Äôs Handshake, but... soon.
---
Wait did they remove the intro gameplay where u are in the mountains or smthing with that epic music playing?
---
Lol.
---
Sadly I dont but that would be sth for me to justify to keep playing Warlock to grind for it. Will it still be that good with Armor 2.0? I‚Äòm still a bit confused by the new system
---
I still have my raisins and celery
---
I went through the entire playlist and I couldn't find it :/ 
---
I'm looking for literally the first song that plays when you teleport to the tower in courtyard. It's got a nice harp(?) melody, that starts when you load in there.
---
Capitalization has wounded me once again.
---
Prometheus lens, this is a no brainer. It melts pretty much everything...this is a must in Presige and Justice Gambit. This is just a must, one of these days they will nerf that shit...
---
https://destinytracker.com/destiny-2/db/items/19024058-prometheus-lens
---
Leave and come back. Sometimes it works. Also be patient and really scour the area... they're sometimes hard to see.
---
I haven't had a chance to play with my DemiGod roll since the power grind is back on...
---
Quick question but do the orbs during the Vorgeth (?) fight despawn or can I just kill all wizards and then pick up the orbs?
---
There better be more an actual ending in the raid
---
I had just shy of 600.. took me a solid 15 minutes to delete them
---
I see, thank you!
---
Yes. All three subclasses are part of base game. The middle tree alternate supers are part of Forsaken.
---
Ah new light little unkilldled guardians.
---
For starters, I'm confident I'm the only person rocking actual Frostveil right now. I got really lucky, I guess. My primary weapon of choice is Riskrunner, and my Frostveil is loaded out the ass with submachine gun perks. I prefer to keep my stuff leveled up as opposed to swapping it out for high light level stuff, so It's all been with me for some time. I'm just so confused because there's these nightfalls that require certain mods? And, eh... I like my submachine gun perks. I am lost.
---
Only for shadowkeep. However if you buy forsaken you also get all last year season content with it.
---
Amanda (in the hanger) will give you access to all the story quests that you can play through.
---
As a veteran from day one, i can comfirm there were warsats on the moon
---
Thanks
---
When is the raid out? Does anyone know
---
I was honestly very much into the game since last week. Got up to lvl 9 and around 120 power, still learning.
---
But the new update blew it for me. Was hopeful to have a new game that I could play after work. Now I'm suddenly bombarded with so many things that I almost can't bother anymore. + I have to replay the storyline...
---
So if im on new light i can't get the middle one?
---

---
Thank you!! I was really frustrated because I was dropped off at the Tower, which my Warlock hadn‚Äôt got to yet. I still feel a bit annoyed but at least I don‚Äôt get to miss out on anything!
---
Correct.
---
So I should be okay to procede?
---
I come from warframe as well, so don¬¥t worry!
---
Because you can create multiple sets of armour that form builds. So you could get armour with high strength for faster melee cool down then couple that with impact induction and Monte Carlo and have some melee intensive build as an example. You also have the ability to transmog eververse armour onto it to look cute as hell...sure it's a huge old grind and a lot of gear I will have to say goodbye too but I see it all as positive
---
Yes you should, good luck guardian
---
Thanks, i was just getting the last piece when i was the comment notification. 
---
Will give it a shot and update the post after.

i have 6/10 with that armor
---
Shoulda stuck to fortniteüòÜüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
The only time I can understand is literally picking up motes that are on the floor if you're one or two off of the next tier blocker. I might understand also being in the middle of slaying and being caught up in the moment for a second.
---
Ok thanks for the tips man!
---
I tell everyone you're my favorite guardian.
---
Its almost equivalent to Achievement Points in World of Warcraft. And for some titles, you need to clear a heap of them. Some of them are required for weapon quests and the like.
---
Thanks you have been just as helpful I'll do that now
---
You might not have access to most exotics, but a decent chunk of Forsaken and the Annual Pass‚Äô content has become free with New Light. You should be fine for the most part with only getting Shadowkeep, but keep in mind you may be less equipped for the endgame with a smaller exotic arsenal.
---
The main things that are exclusive to the Forsaken owners are:
---
-Forsaken Campaign
---
-The Last Wish, Scourge of the Past, and Crown of Sorrow raids
---
-Forsaken/Annual Pass exotics
---
Good lord that‚Äôs gorgeous! Well done!
---
I have no idea what any of that actually entails though. I'm all but incapable of understanding the significance of intricacies like that. I just shoot stuff real good. I have one set of armor. One set of guns that I use. And one way to win. I walk forward and do the big killy kill kill. I'm just a hunter with an electric submachine gun.
---
Hey what platform are you on? There is a streamer on mixer venomwolff that helps people do it all the time. Super nice guy.
---
Me and 2 others had it drop during EP
---
I have like 9 in my vault
---
To clear the normal one, you should head to The Farm. The Heroic version will be available from EDZ Director when normal is cleared.
---
Hey! So since you are playing as New Light that means you can do content at any planet since your light level is high enough. You should work on getting to max level light 950 if you are planning on get shadowkeep. If you dont, i would recommend to get good roll weapons that increase your dps by random drops from activities, I would recommend to look up a guide that explain rolls on weapons so you know what guns to save and to dismantle. You can do strikes, nightfalls with a fireteam, raids, you can also do escalation protocol at mars after completion of the warmind campaign. Good luck and enjoy guardian!

Yeah, it's bad when you have to Google how to start the main campaigns and having access to everything straight away is really overwhelming,
---
Someone will think that this is no cap and im gonna love it
---
not to mention there's no lost glory till 2100
---
i didnt even notice lmao
---
I see Arc Strider, Sentinel, Nova Warp and Golden Gun
---
WHIRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
---
*happy SB noises*
---
ah, i guess that's why i didn't know it. thanks
---
Already did all of that except for comp, it‚Äôs impossible that I‚Äôll jump from 920 to 935 just because of comp.
---
He helps on PC as well. I think he will be on after 7pm est tonight
---
The more I see of this, the more disbelieving I am of this new design. Even returning players can't find the storyline without looking around at random, because nothing in the game clues you in. I had to read here to go to the hangar and get the storyline quest there.
---
Gambit prime/gambit? I get a lot of on gear stuff from that especially from sub rank ups
---
Hungry for karma, are we?
---
Going Tire Gambling, brb.
---
OK scourge gear ain't bad tbh. I actually like my last wish hunter set as well.
---
I read it in his voice
---
I just want The Vow bow from Crimson Days (pls have random rolls, I want Archers Tempo and Dragonfly) and the Spring Breeze transmat effect from the spring season
---
Yes can delete the 5 of swords card and not from what I have seen.  I barely broke 50K doing the easiest variant.
---
aside from all the people no lifing all the powerful gear drops, there is exp grinding for artifact power bonus. supposedly the best way is to get a full fireteam and head to the moon to farm the redoable eris bounties, since they're fast as heck and can be cleared in one lost sector. the exp bonuses stack with each guardian so you can get a bunch of exp real quickly, with the only thing holding you back being whether you have the glimmer to continue buying bounties. rick kackis has a vid about it on youtube iirc
---
Super sexy. It should make the same sound as it backfires.
---
Right? That's what I was going off of.
---
Please mark stuff like this with Spoiler Alert. Some people work and haven‚Äôt been able to play Shadowkeep yet.
---
My steam name was weenierbutt, but now it‚Äôs just weenier**** because for some reason butt is censored.
---
I have a feeling OP had to ask for an advance on his allowance to purchase Shadowkeep, and mommy gave him a hard time for needing more $$ to play Fortnite on his Nintendo Game.
---
BOTH! Carrie was a real one.
---
Have you updated everything in sight? Starting with your graphics card drivers, but including (possibly) things like your motherboard BIOS and of course Windows itself. 
---

---
I got 3 yesterday, not sure if you can track it anywhere.
---
I heard the forges are doing a daily thing instead of weekly but I have no idea tf that means. 
---
It‚Äôs part of a quest line tho.
---
I see what you are saying and I respect that hunter play style...highly immersive but honestly this new armour system will benefit you so much more if you take the time to invest, aztecross gaming did a decent review of the armour to help understand it a little more
---
Thats how we grinded orbs in strikes in D1 üòÅ
---
Thanks.
---
I 3d printed the single parts, painted them with spray paint or mixed metallic paint and glued the whole thing together with some springs for the trigger and mag release.
---
I‚Äôm at power bonus 7+ and the next one is after 700k exp , i don‚Äôt think people jumping that fast because of this
---
I totally agree! I like that the landscape has changed and reflected the living, breathing world as it's affected by the overall continuing narrative. Last night I was doing a lot of side-stuff just to get my light level up so I could do one of the campaign missions. For the first time, in a long time, I felt like I was playing D1 again, the grind, and the anticipation of hitting the next level is so much fun!
---
You're 750 too
---
Not a bad drop either...don't flex on us austringer noobs too hard
---
Oh okay. Is the lv cap still at 30?
---
&gt;As I said, I'm still gonna buy it, I just think its a scummy approach.
---
^ This right here says it all. If you *already know Bungie eventually makes all of their DLC free*, why not just wait to play it after it goes free to play? Then you won't feel like you were "cheated" by "scummy" business practices.
---
You're not wrong. I've felt the same thing, also a new player. Not new to games, but this release was shit. Especially what happens after the introduction. 
---
Stop doing anything else and go find the Amanda character, in the Hangar, and do the Red War quest from there. That will guide you along in the story and give you much more context. That's apparently the original start of the game. I'm doing that now, and not worrying too much about the whole engrams and crafting and stuff yet, just picking stuff up on the side and storing anything that looks interesting for future needs (there's a vault where you can dump stuff).
---
Level cap has been 50 for a long time. But level doesn't matter anymore
---
Guessing you haven‚Äôt looked at the rewards before. They all have that price tag until you unlock them in game.
---
Don't let this guy put you off, most people think the red war campaign is quite good.
---
I'm hearing mixed things about still getting exotics from the campaign but you should at least play it once to see. If various vendors give you an exotic whilst playing like Asher or Sloane than you can probably get exotics on your 2nd and 3rd play through on different characters.
---
I got chills
---
Once you beat the campaign/unlock the triumph it changes price
---
thanks mate, yhou just repeated my question but as a sentence. 
---
yeash I assumn I wouldnt get that aswell.. but some numbers would be nice.. 
---
Also how range and resilience effectiveness cause of the range nerfs.. but frm gameplay it doesnt feel very different..
---
Hunter8/10,subclasses are underwhelming but has a good melee ability. Warlock6/10 I don‚Äôt like this class much,the dlc subclasses are very good but other than that it‚Äôs pretty bad,titan4/10 supers are VERY underwhelming when compared to the others,shoulder charge is pretty ok though
---
Anybody know why it takes materials from everyone in the space of the tire game? A random played and took 5 coils from me and my friend also (who weren‚Äôt in a party with that person)
---
They have a ton of vendor credits! In the beginning you get your gear, Then turn in tokens that gear will raise you a little bit each time. Also you can go to collections and buy gear, it will be a little higher than what you have on, switching back and forth.. repeat until you hit the cap, then go do power drops.. Switch characters and repeat.
---
I don‚Äôt want anymore one eyed masks
---
Bloody troglodytes.
---
Season pass is not shared .. you would only need to buy the pass .
---
I don't remember the last time Warlocks were given anything that wasn't immediately taken away. Giving a shit is pointless though because no matter what you enjoy in this game, it will eventually be taken from you.
---
Ohhh okay that would make sense
---
Yeah you‚Äôre right. It‚Äôs a glitch. There‚Äôs no possible way people aren‚Äôt just better and smarter than you at Destiny.
---
Where though? Theres no icon for them.
---
That‚Äôs exactly what i did!
---
This is Sparta !!!
---
Go to patrol and pull out your ghost?
---
I wonder if it triggers a cooperative mode? Did 3 tires come out or 6?
---
Did you get it too shoot or is it a prop?
---
its a repost dude
---
Your work is always amazing to look at. Great job
---
Check bungie.net and make sure that you dont have any clan invites
---
NW did get shafted but I still run it with Blink and it‚Äôs real mean. I think they should make the Sanguine Alchemy do some better stuff. Keep the tracking wall hacks in a rift but maybe an overshwild when you kill a marked enemy? Idk. That exotic is so cool but so fucking useless
---
Mark it as a spoiler, punk.
---
This really has nothing to do with anything
---
Dont buy engrams ever save silver either for the pass or silver only ornaments
---
I love the super changes i just feel like they added more actions
---
Eater of worlds raid gear thickness is real

Agreed, I hesitatingly dismantled it with a small hope but only got 25 glimmer.

If Sparrow Horns were still a thing it would make the song of a Jotunn firing lol

Fingers crossed

It only happens with destiny 2

I come from ps4 destiny 2 and migrated to PC because it plays so much smoother! Unfortunately I cannot deal with the mouse and keys setup haha. Could I use a controller and still be good in the game? (Besides crucible) Would it really impact me a lot?
---
In almost every season, hand cannons have reigned supreme (with the exceptions of seasons 1-2 where pulse rifle team shooting was life)
---
It's nice to see the meta change. But ill miss my hand cannon ;-;
---
Shit would get stale if the meta never changed, so maybe it's a good thing. I haven't done any pvp in shadowkeep yet so i can't judge.
---
i wanted to get the riskrunner, since with my previous characters i got sunshot and graviton lance, i guess i'll just get it from a random exotic engram

neither sloane, asher nor tyra gave me any exotic, i believe bungie just removed them.
---
my best guess is a bungie bug due to them messing with the light level minimum
---
Appreciate the help. Also, what should I be doing this early in the game? I‚Äôve basically been doing I think Vanguard strikes and I‚Äôm up to 759 power, do I keep doing those or should I try Crucible or what should I do?
---
welcome to gambit, home of the worst teammates possible

Alright what's your PSN

i can count 6 hive gods/ osmonium family tree members we have killed
---
I remember watching this shit on flipnote hatena on my dsi
---
Are you ok?
---
Deathbringer is great right? I just got it didn‚Äôt have time to fully test it out
---
I think it was to lower the masterwork price of infusion since masterworking a piece of armor now costs over 130 cores
---
Maaaan I've only unlocked first 2 tiers of chalice customization (idk if its even called like that).
---
Got distracted with Ace of Spades catalyst, now trying to get Sunshot one. Sooo muchhh stufff to dooooo.

Bruh he turned at you like you violated the law

Yeeeah after posting this I connected the dots. Lol. It threw me off seeing the first 2 instead of 4.

Dsi flipnote studio anyone?

Oof
---
Typical Bungo...."Hey, we're expecting a ton of new players with New Light.  Should we do anything to help them learn the ropes?  Nah, fuck e'm"

Does it do0 damage?
---
I have one for my first gen XB1.
---
The menu/load times are actually bearable thanks to it.
---
no
---
Got that Calus bod!
---
10?
---
So...pretty much all of them?
---
You should be high enough unless they changed it. A while ago the light cap was 700.
---
By the sounds of it you‚Äôre both trying to play at the same time yes? In the last year or two Xbox has made it so you both can‚Äôt play at the same time. You can play and access everything on your Xbox and she can access all your stuff through hers just not while both of you are play the same Title. 
---
(Source: Xbox Ambassador and more importantly I used to do this with my friends Xbox and both play Elder Scrolls together until it kept telling me or him (whoever was playing first) to purchase the game, we would at max get 10 minutes of both playing until it kicked one of us out).
---
I connected the dots. Lol. I felt so stupid for asking after that I didn't reply to anyone till now xD
---
What do xbox players do when using a nVme?
---
That must be like ambrosia of the gods?
---
Yeah true. Or they just give you a level up thing like before. So if you just want to play the new stuff you get to upgrade your char to 750 power and lvl 50. But if not you can play the old stuff like before
---
Thank you Kanye
---
Aye, basicly you get Destiny 2 Base game + Full Year 1 Content + some Y2 Content for free. Forsaken the third expansion (worth it IMO) is avaible to be bought and the newest expansion Shadowkeep aswell. (cant tell if its worth it so far because i didnt had time to play it yet :( ). 
---
Considering its free2play its the best to just download the game and give it a shot to see it for yourself. 
---
GL HF Guardian
---
Say that to my hammers
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ yeah I felt stupid afterwards when I figured it out. I just now cane back to reply to everyone and give them upvotes for helping haha.
---
No, your artifact is totally ignored when leveling up gear. Following your example: if your artifact is +30, when your gear levels to 900, your total light will me 930.
---
Because when I go into orbit the moon says players cannot access this world yet?
---
Jump around?
---
Possible quest for the new heavy bow????
---
Kinda like wish ender?
---
Bruh my hunter is 750
---
What settings are you running and what else do you have open when playing Destiny, if it just happens it's possible your CPU may be overheating and the system is rebooting to keep it from frying. Again make sure to check all power connectors (8pin and 24pin) just to be sure
---
The other aspect of sword logic is the entity who kills has to be willing to to take up the mantle of the entity killed, and start consuming. We obviously didn't, hence why Toland called us a fool for not usurping the taken King title. Had we given in to the darkness after killing Oryx, we would have our own knights.
---
If I want to start a new game with my brothers, do we each need to replay the beginning of the story to get to that point?
---
I ran 3 maybe i got it at the end of a third strike idk,i might have triped out bcause i had no place to claim it.
---
Do you have Shadowkeep? Or have you downloaded new light? Cause if so you can get yo the moon
---
Question....next season are we getting bumped back down to 900 or how is that working?

For the quest step "Symphony of death" you need the ritualistic bone, from "public events near lost sector K1 revelation in sorrows harbor"
---
No clue ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø I'm no vet iv never touch D1 but I have played D2 quite a bit.
---
Pushing just sends an "Ew, get away from me" message, titan punching sends a "You're now a corpse" kind of message
---
I personally love that mission and bannerfall for the ost "journey"
---
Nice art!
---
Oryx Chan UwU
---
very much appreciated.
---
No hot wings...
---
One-Two Punch now can be activated with Peregrine Greaves. I think you can get like 330,000 damage by hip firing in mid air then quickly using the solar shoulder charge after
---
That's because only legendary weapons can use the mod you unlocked.
---
Those barrels be white hot
---
Panicking just costs you a Super that can be used more strategically and if theres more than 2 I use it
---
re-shitpost
---
I thought New Light added a mission or two before the Red Legion start?!
---
thx for the try but when i choose region and click on "buy now" to buy it switch to the psn store and there is only the  normal destiny 2 version and shadowkeep
---
*NVME ssd got noting on me
---
I HAD 20 in my vault until the reckoning happened.   I recently dismantled all but one in case of something.
---
This SMG is a ritual weapon which you can obtain by grabbing the quest from the drifter and playing lots of gambit to fulfil the requirements. 
---
The quest is quite easy, just a bit long.
---
Aww would be cool to play the others, maybe they will add some in, I see/hear l these cool Vault of Glass stories and feel I missed out...
---
 Ace of Spades, The Last Word, one thousand voice, Jotun, Lord of wolves, Two Tailed fox, and some others. I just listed Forsaken Exotic since I haven't try any of Shadowkeep's exotic yet.
---
Pretty much although if you manage to hit +30 on artefact before hitting soft cap something has gone wrong haha.
---
This is what peak performance looks like
---
Get both. Forsaken gets you some neat supers and Shadowkeep has some very interesting reveals.
---
uh oh I think I did a poopy :O haha poopy funny yay poopy
---
 dang boi he ***thicc***
---
That‚Äôs D2
---
I didn't know the Monte Carlo was back till I got wiped with it in the crucible
---
I‚Äôm trying to step into a war with the Cabal on Mars, but I‚Äôm dummy T H I C C and the clap of my asscheeks keeps alerting Valus Tu‚Äôarc
---
Do you have black armory downloaded?
---
Foresaken gets foresaken content and shadowkeep gets you shadowkeep content. So whatever your feeling. I‚Äôd say go with shadowkeep though
---
This happened to me today, clanmate yeeted me into the wall
---
That's what I was thinking, kinda sucks all these guys says it works with any gear but exotic
---
Definitely my favourite gun for  shadowkeep so far. But I‚Äôm hesitant to use it now that I finally got my recluse üòÇ
---
HECK yes.
---
I'm a warlock and I hate well. Just saying hahaha I'm sure I get cursed out plenty though because I love Nova bombing 3 plus players trying to capture a zone. Makes me day lol
---
True
---
Recluse&gt; (insert any sub machine gun here)
---
As a Hunter... I never can kill anyone with my super in crucible...
---
Forsaken is probably the best expansion is destiny history. Shadowkeep is like a rise of iron equivalent but slightly better.
---
Yep
---
Cross save has nothing to do with multiple accounts just let you play the same account cross platform.  You are essentially saying transfer between accounts.  If would have been figured out way before cross save.
---
I've noticed that drop mag has a quicker reload than alloy, timed isnt to bad but i never used it in pvp, and surrounded is really situational, there are of course better rolls like rampage/outlaw. You'll have to try it in pvp yourself to see if you want to keep it.
---
Will do
---
Honestly lol but I haven't used it after the nerf so idk how great it is rn
---
He does because hes not replyed
---
Isn't that included with forsaken? Or am I missing something?
---
What‚Äôs your favorite so far?
---
GLORIOUS!
---
SPLENDID!
---
Thanks !!! That worked for me 
---
First go I Peregrine Greaved the Witch!!!
---
The deed is done
---
You need an anti barrier model from the seasonal artifact
---
i heard rise of iron is DLC for D1 but i didnt played that game :(
---
Shoot it with a gun with Barrier Mod. Eriana‚Äôs Vow comes with one intrinsically
---
It's been a while since I did the red war campaign, but I think I got an exotic from her during the campaign, not after. Beyond that, I don't know.
---
You can still get one of the exotics by completing the quest from banshee-44.
---
I‚Äôd you don‚Äôt care about raiding or getting to max light fastest I would got forsaken than Shadowkeep just so you follow the narrative of the story
---
Though depending on the match a wasted super isnt a worry, cause you'll get another one during the match
---
I thought about that too. I didn‚Äôt know if they had changed anything with the new code where this may be something that can now be achieved.
---
Don't you fucking dare to profanate this great man's death!
---
I‚Äôve been using it ( about 910 power) and it still shreds. It might actually be better after the damage buff even tho master of arms was nerfed
---
I wasnt sure about them at first but now that i realize the implications... Hehehehehehe
---
Epic! (And nice job not spoiling)
---
Second column of the artifact has barrier round perks, get one, put it on a gun, when he does that use that gun, profit
---
Ok s o basically armor mods drop with loot now, they are permanent
---
Ricochet rounds was nerfed,  is that still a god roll perk?
---
I would be struggling in SK if I didn‚Äôt have it
---
Not everyone is on there screens looking for the new updates and information like you just because I'm one person who doesn't keep up with the new updates on what's going on dont mean you got to be cruel you knob
---
Hm when I hit 900 I'll have to try it out
---
If you are asking if there is a bundle with both Forsaken and Shadowkeep, the answer is no. You have to buy them separately.  That said you do not need Forsaken to play Shadowkeep. 
---
If you need to pick one I would get shadowkeep since it is new and more relevant.  You can always get Forsaken later if you want to go through the story or do the raid.
---
At least it isn‚Äôt directly competing with recluse so that‚Äôs ok I guess
---
I only have my wife on my list, prob the reason why I have never touched a raid lol.
---
Where can I find this artifact sorry I'm new i got no idea
---
And moves around way more
---
I mean do i need   forsaken content? I mean is weapons and armors viable after shadowkeep is released or they are "nice things thats is gonna be in your bank for memories"?
---
Btw shadowkeep dlc pack in steam offered Season and something else for ~same price.
---
I fed one and it gave me a piece of blue gear, I didn‚Äôt get teleported anywhere
---
Brand new people start there and That's where my Hunter started when I created him Thursday morning... Maybe it's a cap until you buy the xpac? Idk...
---
I ran a few strikes, did some quests to get the 780 needed for the start of shadowkeep quests.
---
I wish we could pick a side. Like picking the darkness over the light and vice versa.
---
You would have to buy forsaken and shadowkeep, as everything prior is now free
---
I really wish they'd made it an option to go through the story content or start at 750, but considering how massive D2 is file-size wise I'm guessing they wanted to cut down on how big the f2p version is? I don't know
---
Literally the only weapons I‚Äôm using right now are from foresaken so. Because there arnt many weapons in shadowkeep right now
---
It's weird though because the leviathan breath is in the tower and that's the next quest
---
Sorry, your submission has been automatically removed. 
---
It appears you are asking a question about LFG/Clans, or help in-game. 
---
Please post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/bzjpkr/official_lfg_megathread_v_4/) instead, look at the LFG dropdown menu on the top bar of the subreddit for various LFG resources, or check the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/bvr9ex/official_faq_please_read_before_posting/?) for possibly helpful advice on how to find people to play with our advertise/find clans.
---
Ooooh so i can get "middle" class upgrades only with forsaken? Thanks!
---
So? They don't drop from there, maybe once in 100 strikes. They need to drop those rates asap or i'll just keep them like this. No point in wasting 1000's of cores just so i can have my armor masterworked.
---
You would be surprised get 5 extra bounties from zavala each and every strike and it quickly adds up. Same for the other vendors.
---
It'll be unlocked when you hit level 7 of the season pass thing, then it will be on the bottom left side of your guardian menu once you claim it from the season tab of course
---
Fist of havoc has been nicknamed ‚Äúfist of panic‚Äù for close on 5 years and people are mad about blade barrage?
---
Don‚Äôt it‚Äôs probably gonna be free on the 16th
---
It‚Äôs not a crime to want new stuff. I can‚Äôt believe that some people won‚Äôt rest until the entirety of D1 is ported to D2
---
I know what you're thinking. Did¬†he¬†fire six shots or only five? Well, to tell you the truth, in all this excitement, I've kinda lost track myself. But being as this is Eriana's Vow, the most powerful handcannon in the galaxy, and would blow your head clean off, you've got to ask yourself one question: "Do I feel lucky?" Well, do ya, punk?
---
Picked it up off of a hive enemy in the first or second mission
---
It‚Äôs legendary right?
---
Ohh tysm imma level up to 7 now
---
That's insane, awesome job!
---
Is there any announcement for it to be free?
---
I don't think you need to delete the NL version. Both Forsaken and Shadowkeep should be DLCs for NL.
---
As for content, Forsaken currently has more. I think they rolled all the stuff from the (old) annual pass into it.
---
Let me find it one sec
---
Team of six rat kings &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
---
With shadowkeep you get forsaken in theory
---
same
---
Traveler guide you friend.
---
same x2 and i'm glad to see i'm not the only one
---
Love it ahaha üòÇ
---
Talk to Ikora after Zavala
---
Whisper is still there doing highest dps in the game
---
You need to buy forsaken to access forsaken campaign / year 2. You can do this from Tess the Eververse vendor.
---
He's here in about 30 minutes
---
War rig?
---
My thought exactly.
---
Most people do not
---
That 15k average damage made my jaw hit the floor.
---
Then it started damaging in the 20-25k range, and I didn't know what to say. (Light 780-ish)
---
That she is.
---
Not many people use "game/voice chat" these days, in my experience. They either party-up or play solo and don't enter game/voice chat.
---
Thank you!
---
I am not sure, I had from crucible (internet connection) and I think that it took or 2 hours or 24 (yeah a pretty large scale I know lol)
---
I looked at the other photo and realized that lol
---
I actually had a similar "treat it as semi" revelation with the Sybaris (a highly accurate 2 round burst rifle with a fast burst and virtually no recoil on the 1st shot) in Warframe and I resolved to give burst weapons a fresh try. Then I tried the Burston (works like every Pulse Rifle I've tried in Destiny) and gave up again. I don't think I'll find a burst weapon I'll like unless there's something similar to the Sybaris in Destiny. It's more of a "feel" thing than anything rational
---
depotcache has 75GB for me,is that wise?
---
Thanks, should I first buy Shadowkeep and buy it there or in New Light? If that's even how it works
---
It says how she was killed a while back. Can remember what she died by but she was killed by something
---
Florida man found to be all of those things and more.
---
Oh nice so I have access to forge and Eris Morn storyline? 
---
Thank you for the effort, I appreciate it!
---
Thanks for the big post and the encouraging words
---
And at the end of it all we still didn't get to meet King Space Tut
---
I might when I've gotten all this season's stuff at least covered...I have a list a mile long I need to do, like going for the Undying title and farming The Ordeal.
---
For now, this SMG is a guaranteed drop so I'm okay with grinding knowing I'm gonna get it instead of relying on the same RNG I been relying on for a few months now üòÇ
---
Do you have a moment to talk about our lords and saviours, Sweet Business and War Rig?
---
I wish more people did. My mic is normally on when I join missions with pubs.
---
At the least it means you have a vendor that has something for you, be it either a powerful reward or tou have even materials to turn in for goods.
---
As a new player, can someone explain to me why they don't just have a competitive pvp playlist with set loadouts? Seems like the current system just promotes pubstomping by players with better gear. How do they expect to have balanced pvp when you can use any gun you get from PvE content? Seems like an impossible task to me.
---
I bought normal game.... But for some reason, I have season pass.... Im confused. And prolly just fucked myself saying it, cause we all know what gets prio in these situations. xD
---
I think you can have someone who hasn't done the quest yet take you but other than that I don't think so. I'm not sure why that little zone can't just be visible at all times cause of nostalgia but bungie didn't leave it in the director.
---
Several of the nightmare hunts are just less intense D1 strikes and I love it. Going through phogoth again was fun as hell
---
Unlimited power!!!
---
Do you mean before the collapse? Because yes I agree it would be there before the red war, because it helped fund it in this theory
---
Cross-Save is simply picking the bungie character account (steam, xbox, PS4) that you want to play on across all platforms.  You have to purchase the game on each platform you want to play on. 
---
So if you have characters with gear, triumph score, titles/seals, etc.  on PS4 and you want to now play only on PC  you would need to make sure that your steam and PS4 are both connected on [battle.net](https://battle.net) and make your PS4 account your primary account.  You would then purchase the game on Steam and play on steam with the your PS4 characters.  
---
If you ever decided to play on PS4 you would need to purchase Shadowkeep on your PS4 to play it there, otherwise you would only have the F2P stuff and any other content you previously purchased on PS4.
---
I know it was said that she was thought to be dead but nothing about an actual death
---
EV and seasonal sets. The Vex plasticity something set that drops from level 60 something of the pass is an ornament.
---
Had around 460 friends, had to purge a few people
---
Strongbird wants his bread.
---
In the tower, if you‚Äôre looking at the map of the tower, Amanda is all the way to the RIGHT
---
*Legend tells us that anyone could hear his approach for a mile as he was so fucking thicc*
---
No, and most likely this post will be overwhelmed by the New player influx requests.
---
Im still trying myself and will Post a resolve if i find one.
---
You can solo some of the D1 raids, if you're still playing them.
---
I've done 1/2 not 900 yet done more and hasn't gone up
---
Oh shit.. that actually good
---
\*slaps side\*
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
This baby can fit so many barrels in it
---
I like this theory! I'm excited to see what Bungie does with the darkness and what else will be coming our way after the season of the undying!
---
This is a huge reason destiny doesn't actually have a competitive scene. It also doesn't have dedicated servers, which is another big reason.
---
Slower rate of fire, less spread, possibly more damage
---
Yeah, I quickly decided that I am never gonna use this gun.
---
I tend to say bad words when I get mad or upset, so I keep mine off incase I am playing on a server with a kid.
---
Wow it doesn't even have dedicated servers? Seems like they don't even want a competitive pvp scene in that case, which is kind of sad.
---
Either works for the middle trees.
---
What platvorm?
---
You acquired 17 seasonal levels without leaving the tower?
---
It was the tutorial gun i think
---
I found one on amazon for a reasonable price ($140 for 1TB), and it‚Äôs tiny. My load times are crazy fast now
---
Actium war rig is an exotic chest piece that constantly feeds ammo (I believe 15) into auto rifles and machine guns every few seconds
---
Tier 1 will get you a few levels higher than whatever your current gear is. Tier 2 is slightly more than that
---
Still waiting for mine to drop
---
Ps4
---
....you can ride those?
---
How do I start this mission?
---
I still carry my masterworked foresaken mark of Cayde on my titan and only change it when I need some new perks
---
Bought the engram today
---
Maximum Daka
---
I was unsure too, but went with my gut (after second guessing myself like 12 times)
---
YAAAAAY NOTHING MORE FUN THAN SHOOTIN TIRES
---
Ours is now Ho
---
Last time I did a raid, I was running slova bomb since we were all level capped at the time. Still made me switch to well.
---
My Destiny friends are my r/redditdads clanmates.
---
I've gotten get-down-mr-presidented by random thrall during almost every single nightmare hunt so far
---
No, no, no, brutal would be stepping on a Lego while running on your way to bank your motes.
---
Dear bungie please never nerf this weapon
---
Instant KO
---
üòÇ why is this meme not used more?
---
Yes because u can pair it with recluse
---
Check your Pursuits tab. You may have to get the 3 pieces of dream armor an have specific tasks to do to get them.
---
They changed it and then back? Damn that's lame, I don't mind the random perk rolls on items, I guess there has to be something for the top players to grind towards. What is putting me off is the dicking about with the light level of older items when a new cap is dropped. Especially Exotics, if they would just keep the exotic items maxxed during an update it wouldn't be as bad. 
---
So your current LL, which is set by the items you currently have equipment affect how your engagements with enemies play out but what does your theoretical max LL based off your best drops affect?
---
OK yeah that light level thing which allows for 100 difference is similar to how it worked in D1, that system is pretty good.
---
Sorry for the million questions lol.
---
Ornaments are currently only eververse purchased gear, and on year 3 legendarys
---
The Wardcliff Coil is just straight nasty in Gambit.
---
ANT! What are you doing messing with the natural order? lol
---
Definitely not broken. It's in just the right place
---
Don't do that. Don't give me hope
---
Ok this man speaking straight fax (also me over here with a thousand army of one medals BULL SHIT)
---
What‚Äôs over-powdered precious?
---
Yikes then idk then maybe it was just a 1 time bug, personally I wouldn‚Äôt buy another one unless I was bathing in shards
---
Yeah but the game doesn't even bother to search for teammates, it just instantly puts you into a managerie solo. And even if the DLC is out quite a lot of people do managerie frequently.
---
Yes.
---
With any luck, I'll never have to reload Riskrunner, lol. I'm an arc seeking missile.
---
Yes, but I feel like there will be enough backlash for them to add specific gear sets to ornaments.
---
At the start of Destiny 2 it was a lot easier. Wish they'd go back to that. They seem to want to make it a pain, though.
---
I think what bothers me the most, is that they simulated glitter instead of just putting it in there ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø  [sleeve](https://imgur.com/a/rwbzKOc)
---
Dayum, that's 15 euro's. No thanks.
---
I think someone posted that it may be coming for free later this month.  But I am not positive on that.  Check the store of your platform, or try to purchase a digital game key online if you just have to have it right now.
---
Happened to me a couple weeks ago. The only hunter item I didn't have was Liar's Handshake and he gave me a Sweet Business, which I had sitting my vault even... Got Liar's later after a crucible match though so it worked out I guess.
---
Agreed.
---
I have a question about the expansions. I  played D2 a lot up and through CoO, I own warmind but had stopped playing as all mu friends that played had stopped. Should I also get forsaken with the new Shadowkeep DLC, or just jump straight to shadowkeep? Also how long would you guess it to take to grind up my hunter. I left off at level 750. Thanks for any info.
---
I'll admit I'm not a great invader, but like, let me go steal motes man. I just wanna rob the bank
---
I would actually run either huckleberry or bad juju for primary, since they dont need that arc damage to proc effect.
---
Wait, is yours not completely solid? Like, the inner red part, is that the shirt? Can‚Äôt tell from the photo, but yours looks different than mine.
---
Then I dont know what happened
---
Becoming a troll ü§Øüêú
---
Gotta do standard nightfall (not ordeal)  with your five of swords set to 100 or more extra power. Should still work, might be bugged if you've tried that.
---
I feel dirty just looking at this.
---
Damn okay I was just making a joke but alright
---
They could just be offline or playing offline.
---
They could be on a different system than you. 
---
Could be a glitch saying they are offline when they are actually online. 
---
My best advice is to reach out to them and see if they want to play with you. Otherwise, you can find a different clan or use LFG to do activities with people.
---
I've been around since destiny 1 day 1 and I can definitely say if you went back to those days, the game would be unrecognizable. So many changes and things that the game has gone through. My Titan has been through it all and I've had a ton of fun along the way. I hope you enjoy the game as much as possible!
---
Here‚Äôs a better pic of it, the red is the shirt[closeup](https://imgur.com/a/bTuHbmO)
---
[https://imgur.com/a/mKZcc9j](https://imgur.com/a/mKZcc9j)
---
Right side. Cant figure it out
---
Yeah people use Activision as an excuse. Sure Bungie changed/improved things like the armour system and added cross save. But the rest is recycled or lacks in some way. So few exotics, recycled PvP maps, recycled raid armour, same map from D1, same bosses. Keep in mind Trials still hasn't returned, a mode people payed for. It's cool you enjoy the game but don't make it seem like the games a million times better because Activision left.
---
for me I had to restart the entire DLC, went to Amanda down in the hanger to grab the DLC first mission (and where you can get any other old campaigns) again.
---
Ornaments are bound to account, and are removed from inventory when unlocked. Open the item it applies to and hover over the ornament slot to see it and apply
---
Ornaments can be used as many times as you want, on any gear that will take it. 
---
Was that cloak an ornament? Cause if you unlocked it, it should show up with the other ones.
---
\*shrug\*  
---
You've got 3 character slots.  Destiny has 3 classes.
---
How in the hell did you...
---
Eris made me a Warlock bond out of a dead crow. I wonder if Rustic Cuff has dead crow wear. (Lol)
---
I feel the same. I just wish you could ride your sparrow on mercury.
---
How do you tag spoiler?
---
It‚Äôs cross save, meaning you can take your progress with you. Not crossplay like CoD MW
---
Bought the base game and first dlc when they were both new. Haven‚Äôt played since. Worth coming back, or am I gonna need to buy a ton of stuff to even get caught up?
---
Whats the current max light lvl?
---
In a cave beneath Eris. Go to the edge of the platform where your ship docks, move right of the frames and turn around you'll see an entrance that leads to the cave the rabbits go.
---
Ive not gotten into anything really but Patrols and Public events. I play more than the missus as such I hold myself back from certain content so we can play together. Will probably play through some tonight though, hopefully.
---
I‚Äôm calling Bungie.
---
If spending an extra $10 is to much then go pay $60 for the new COD or BL3. If not being able to make your armor look like any armor you want is such a big deal then don‚Äôt get it, armor 2.0 is 100x better than year 1 and 2.
---
Only a couple weapons change type, like borealis. Theres an exotic auto rifle that does too. Everything else only comes in one type.
---
The guys name was SONofCROTA
---
That's why you take the proper stance, and not stand with your feet parallel
---
But in all seriousness, this is super funny
---
DO IT! I ain't scared!
---
I got a rice cake from a random chest and was like "??? Bungie what is this?!?" and thought it was just Bungie being Bungie before I remembered the rabbits exist.
---
I‚Äôm not your Buddy, PAL!
---
Ok, just got off the phone. They said if u r at 192 light u is big dumb.
---
I just got mine yesterday. I guess the color of mine isn‚Äôt what was advertised so Bungie sent me an email saying I can either refund it or get 20% off my next Bungie store purchase. So I got a shirt and 20% off. üòä
---
Does it also shorten long names?
---
Code of commander with doom fang

Rasputin did that on purpose. He nailed that chest.

Whip out your ghost and look where the waypoint is

‚ÄúFuck you, grandpa, and the tombship you rode in on!‚Äù

No
---
They give you 9 Phantasmal Fragments. Which are pretty useful, so.
---
You should probably see what you want to buy first before buying non refundable premium currency
---
That would be broken, but I actually don't know for sure
---
Man, what a ballache. But hopefully it works. I'll go there now. Thanks!
---
Do you mean the blue ball
---
So then it's 100% Fairview to call one probably garbage, seeing as how you haven't tried 2 I don't think it's very fair. When are you go try and play Anthem if you want to experience what a pile of garbage is.
---
Yeah, me too...
---
For Titans I hope, this would be great
---
No weapons do that
---

Try unlocking one of the newer supers. Same thing happened to my Titan and after unlocking "Code of the Commander", I got the achievement "Zavala's Lieutenant"

You can still get your light up with engrams after 900, just have to be from certain activities
---

*holy shit*

I did the same. Bought d2 with Foresaken included. Didnt start playing till a couple of weeks ago. Was going through the campaign and they updated everything. Got back on and was totally lost.

High I‚Äôm a returning destiny 2 player but I have forgotten almost everything in the game and I was wondering how to get legendary shards and who is xur and also I‚Äôm planning on getting the forsaken dlc so what are some tips that y‚Äôall op guardians have for me
---
Legit just spammed comp on my titan, got to 900 ez
---
In D2 Thorn isn't a weapon of sorrow, when you find it in the camp fire its all molten and to fix it you infuse it with your light, therefore it can't permanently kill a guardian anymore.
---
It seems common as hell since New Light. I got it like once or twice a week before, now I get it several times an hour
---
Still waiting on mine üò≠
---
holy fuck this blew up more than I thought! If any of you see me online, dont hesitate to shoot me an invite!
---
Those were all issues in the early 2000s, not so much today. 
---
The cost of a ps4 pro and 2 years of ps+ is easily enough to get you a pc that outperforms the ps4 pro and will last you several years. 
---
You're spreading misconception, because pc is almost as plug and play as modern consoles.
---
He's not even a chracter. He's a shitty caricature
---
I don‚Äôt believe I did... seeing that I‚Äôm not raid ready üßê
---
Make sure your playing in full screen?? Could be the mouse coming out of the window and audio cutting when you do. Same for the mouse not responding. 
---
That‚Äôs what it seems like it could be to me.
---
isn't there a $35 version
---
I recently got back into destiny, I completed the campaign on one character, played a bit of it on another and didn't touch the third character. I was able to get the first two to around 920 light, but i can't get gear above 750 on the third when exploiting collections. Does anybody know if I need to beat the campaign on the third character before I can start getting gear above 750?
---
Nice. This really cool. A+++ work.
---
inb4 locked because "Yall can't behave"
---
Looks really good tho
---
I call bullshit
---
You should be. üòú Unless you haven't been able to boot up the expansion yet lol. Then, no sweat.
---
Perhaps because you're infusing something that's still 1.0 with a 2.0?
---
"If it took more than one shot, you weren't using a Jakobs!"
---
That‚Äôs the same thing with me, I‚Äôve always wanted it but I never went for it and now I can‚Äôt.
---
Have you tried uninstalling the game and reinstalling it?
---
We will probably get an ads sens before traction toggle lol.
---
Sell your game then. Yall mindset is so toxicating feeling like yall deserve something. Hell then i should deserve something since i played since the beta of d1. Nah but i dont because thats dumb and greedy logic. Bungies over here trying to push the destint franchise in a better direction in the midst of all these greedy ass games suckin the chicken off greedy suprise mechanic publishers, and yall want compensation lol thats like someone you know winning the lottery and you bugging em about that 1 time you gave em a cookie and that they should give you $1000000. You and all the other people who have the same mindset arent entitled to crap from bungie. They paid their dues when yall paid for the game and dlc. And the logic of getting shadowkeep for free do yall want to run bungie into the ground. They dont have a big suprise mechanic publisher to give them millions of dollars now. If anything yall should feel like that yall should support bungie in anyway possible if you actually like the game. If not get outta here because the moon's haunted and the killer robots are coming.
---
No, that's your mom, you're confused.
---
That makes me super sad...
---
Corsair right? Force update your mouse and IQUE and that will fix it.  IV had an m65 pro for years and it's a constant problem on destiny

I've not talked to a single person that regrets purchasing a SSD upgrade. But go on being stubborn if you enjoy taking longer to load everything.
---
Yeah I just looked at my vault and I had two 0 light travelers chosen lol
---
It does not matter what forge you do. All weapons can be forged at any forge
---
where did you find the essence for the scout?
---
Yeah but I shouldn't be hitting 74s at 25 meters when I have memento mori active which btw that's inside handcannon range. I'm not mad with the changes they SAID were coming to handcannons, they said drop off would be more apparent and I was like  "that ain't no problem". But they lied and its blatantly obvious that they nerfed the range
---
I‚Äôll be amazed if anyone under 40 knows this.
---
I got one randomly from some legendary rewards
---
Huh? Just join each other
---
Plot twist: I'm 27
---
Let that be a lesson for those who come between a man and his finisher...
---
They said they were reducing the effect of the range stat, what else did you expect? Maybe it was too harsh but the nerf was needed.
---
Im not entirely sure...im new to the game myself.
---
This is so ridiculous and I love it.
---
What are you talking about? It‚Äôs an excellent feature.
---
We need more guardians like you
---
It's next to the fire pit where the Thorn chest was
---
