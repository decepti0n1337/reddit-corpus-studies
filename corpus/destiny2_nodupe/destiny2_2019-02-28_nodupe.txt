I'm more envious of the Bergusian Nights tbh. It's bullshit that it only drops off Gold frames.

Nice shot!

I see that you too have Jotunn

Good information!

Try the Bug In the System Heroic. It might drop for you!

Ehh its cabal itll be fine 
---
Did you solo it?
---
I assume this was the single most interesting game for shax to watch.

---
*Guardian hurls grenade then switches teams and runs over to it as it explodes*
---
Shax: "what the hell is he doing?"
---
Arcite: "I am not sure sir, should I send someone to stop him?"
---
Shaxx: ".... No, this match is just getting warmed up."
---
*Guardian continues to struggle against himself for the duration of the match ending in a resounding defeat of the the blue team*
---
This is why I love doing bounties in the EDZ. Most of the time I can knock them all out when I see 'The enemy is moving against each other' outside the church. Equip Riskrunner and shoot for about a minute or so. Bounties complete.
---
just play for fun not thinking about your numbers and you‚Äôll get better naturally!!! 
---
even getting killed is fun because you get to learn from your mistakes
---
Yeah but you said "any triumph" which is confusing sounding as there are hundreds of triumphs
---
Id buy one 
---
No one cares, people can make whatever requirement they want for their groups. If you don‚Äôt like it just make your own group. It‚Äôs kind of weird to post their psn/gt here when they didn‚Äôt do anything weird 
---
Just guessing, but it's probably because there's been a steady stream of around 10 questions per day of people asking this or something similar.

New ornament idea?

There are some people who did more than ONE HUNDRED clears of VoG hard for Mythoclast, and got it eventually, or didnt and stopped. Many also did the same for hard Crota for the Crux. We have only just reached a max of 75 attempts(if week 1, on all three characters each and every week). I would venture that many of these attempts are not even full raids(as was neccesary with VoG, unless you coordinated checkpoint swapping), but people wishing to riven to cheese and queens walk. 
---
You are correct about people forgetting how much worse the grind was. I remember farming the one cave on Mars for hours and hours, just to get some legendary engrams. Exotics were a huge pain to unlock, because they required tons of experience and materials to unlock the perks. Even then, if you wanted it to remain relevant, you had to farm for more extra rare materials to infuse or upgrade the power on it.
---
Imagine the outrage if you had to dismantle an exotic today(for exotic shard), each time you wanted to infuse your existing exotic, or pull one back from collections.  Or the outrage to use 1kv exotic perk, you had to spend time grinding it to unlock(as was the case with bad Juju and its string of curses perk) Sure seeds of light and bounties helped some with this, but it still took a lot of grinding either way to do it.
---
Im okay with the rng grind, but doesnt mean I care for it. I generally wind up doing that stuff anyways when I help others.
---
I'm in AZ... and I'm about to go have an interesting conversation about a 5th dog with my girlfriend...

This is witch-hunting.

And it's severely against the rules.

I didn‚Äôt find a crucible game for 15 min then got the chap quest I guess
---
people don't invade using supers smh. got 4/10 and I've been playing at least 9 gambit matches every week for the past 6 months...

I got 5 wipes while they had their primeval back to back. Felt like a celebrity.

What do I spend it on? I can't spend it fast enough.
---
You know I'll give you that  and have my updoot lol.  I dunno D2 music is decent in individual instances  to me but it just doesn't draw me into the world like d1 did
---
Grind public events and lost sectors. Try to make the public events heroic. 
---
i dont need to change your mind because its an opinion, and you are nostalgic about d1 music but not about d2 because its still relevant. facts.
---
Ngl I‚Äôm also down somewhat down for what Fallout recommended and having a solo Not Forgotten quest where it takes a really really long time to get the gun but then again everyone having the gun would ruin the uniqueness of the gun
---
I tell you exactly as I forgot but it is one of those Mars shaders. 
---
I just got it the other day, grinding for the Ikelos SMG. Never playing Escalation Protocol again. Never again...
---
Well, any weapon is going to be a problem if you don't see it coming. Even an auto rifle, because if they get those first shots they have the advantage. I know they won't one shot you but chances are they'll still kill you.
---
I have to basically use it like a shotgun in Crucible. In Gambit it does well though.
---

Except it says in the article "Tesla denies this and sent photos of rails and posts painted yellow
---
Literally an entire article/rumor being spread with the disclaimer "our claim was proven incorrect" in the midst of it
---
It is lol, says so right in the article 
---
Just no new content until it is revisited. Probably a few times next season. People are dumb. There's some changes to certain weapons and armor, rank resets and some new exotics coming. That's it so far. It's not a new expansion or D3. Geez. It's basically a patch.
---
That‚Äôs fair, I could start doing Riven properly. As for always wanting something - well no shit. I love the raids and will always want more. What I‚Äôm suggesting is in line with what they‚Äôve done before though. You can‚Äôt really suggest that putting in a weapon restriction on SOTP to create a prestige mode and offering some additional loot drops for it (like SoS and EoW) is a totally unreasonable request.
---
Too bad it‚Äôs the last week to give this a try, they‚Äôre changing the blockers for next season 
---
Let‚Äôs be bad guys
---
https://violationtracker.goodjobsfirst.org/parent/tesla-motors

While the yellow paint isn't true, it IS true that Tesla has been Penalized by OSHA AT LEAST 8 Times and the by the EPA twice
---
Fuck, how bad is the changes? I guess we‚Äôll find out today
---
What do you need 80 kills without dying for? Sorry, I don't chase triumphs.
---
Goblin with less health than the phalanx, captain with more health than the knight, and knight with more health than the ogre, so it‚Äôll be a lot more worth it to go for 15 motes, and of a course a lot more riskier 
---
That.... Is a pretty badass screen shot. 
---
I hope they don‚Äôt cuz that would just be sad. I mean it‚Äôs sad enough that they‚Äôre nerfing one eyed mask bcuz people can‚Äôt think of strategical ways to combat it, or that they nerfed telesto bcuz people don‚Äôt know how to dodge out of the way, but seriously ? I hope this is a joke, lol (I mean idc if it is, or isn‚Äôt, lol) but man, I hope they don‚Äôt nerf joten (idk how to spell it I‚Äôm like half asleep, half highh rn..!/) so my spelling Finn be fuckedn up. Lol 
---
"  **service** " you...with 23 kills logged on your weapon that must of been a long running "   **service**  "

what the fuck, how?

Yes yes, but Journey, Man They Called Cayde, *i could go on...*
---
I was total shit with HCs until I got TLW and AoS. I forced myself to use them. Just grinding to get them made me better. Haven't even attempted Luna's though. Maybe next season.
---
New max will be 700 in a few days...
---
Sounds like I need to make a trip to Walmart. Thanks man!
---
lots of complaining for the guy that still won
---
Hah! 420 &amp; 69. Shit, take an internet point.
---
PC or console?  I wonder
---
What. I lost dude LMAO
---
There were quite a few sales lately for Destiny on PC (free base game in November, another sale that ended February 6th, and the one you mentioned). 
---
Dunno, when next will be, you can keep an eye out here: /r/GameDeals/
---
I mean, who need kinetic anyway.
---
I can't imagine how Cayde-6 fans would be like if Uldern is actually become new vanguard in D3.
---
But... But... I love my god roll ba pulse rifle 
---
He's rubber and you're glue. Simple.
---
That glimmer cap is fucking obscene. I thought the level cap went up as you progressed through the game, and when I found out it didn't, I had to question whether the person who came up with it was mentally capable of tying their own shoe laces.
---
RNGesus is taking it away from you.
---
**Short answer:**  
---
We don't know how the fuck a lot of it works.
---
**Longer answer:**  
---
We still don't have any idea, really.  
---
Tests in the past have indicated that more finder perks actually reduce the effect (and make you get less ammo in return), but there's two issues with that:
---
1. The amount of tests was way, way too low. You could run a test with hundreds of thousands enemies and their drops, yet still don't make out the difference between a specific amount of perks, due to the derivation introduced by the RNG used in the first place.
---
2. We don't know if it's even active at all time. Given that ammo drops are adjusted on a per-map basis, they could very well be active during raids, yet be inactive during strikes for example. There's simply no information about it.
---
Until bungie actually tells us what exactly the perks do, we can't really give any precise answer to it. Which is sadly the case with a lot of things in the game.
---
You can do it on both, but it's easier on PC with a macro
---
I was wondering this too  before i bought the annual pass, the info how seasons work js a bit vague at some times
---
[removed]
---
Character level (max 50) doesn't matter much.
---
Gear level (or light level or power level) is the important thing. Gear level is the number on the top right if you open your inventory. Currently max 650, soon 700.
---
I got mine about 4 runs in. Pissed my buddy off bad!
---
Back when gear sets looked cool...
---
Wait what

---
I just want those swords back...
---
He's alive? is that part of the black armoury or dreaming city quest. Last time I saw him was, well get shot by a hand cannon.
---
I managed to get one of these things into the "Rare Green Place" while hunting Kaniks in the main Forsaken questline.
---
riskrunner and wardcliff coil at 380 light level
---
It was released during Black Armory you don‚Äôt actually need Black Armory to see the cutscene but yes he was revived as a guardian cutscene is pretty easy to find in YouTube if you want to see it
---
Seems my post may have been removed...anyway, I said, I'll Gambit with you on PC. Got a Discord too. PM if you want. I play almost every night after 6 (EST). It would be nice to group with someone that isn't a total moron.
---
ok ty.
---
I've had something in the .1 range before with perfect spawn points Haha
---
Can't get Ace of spades without getting headshots with a cannon lol. That's the part of the quest I'm on.
---
I have trust and a nice orchid. 
---
I haven't even reached 650 yet :/
---
lets all be bad together remember when the thorn was not Nerft
---
Always a good day to see slidey bois get melted 
---
It‚Äôs a bullshit article. Tesla even proved to the writers that they actually do use yellow by sending photos.
---
I dismantled my Enhanced Hand Cannon Targeting / Special Ammo Finder One Eyed Mask as a noob when my friend (who introduced me to the game) told me that dismantling Exotics is fine since you can always make them again from your Collections menu. I tried it on The Scientific Method to be sure, then made the mistake that still haunts me to this day.
---
No. I was mainly in with at least 3 other people. I tried queueing solo but didn‚Äôt enjoy it at all.
---
He's in the EDZ or nearby grinding out the story missions and the low levels.
---
We wont see him for a while.
---
He has to get to level 13 before he can continue the story! He needs experience if he‚Äôs going to be the next Hunter vanguard 
---
Isn't it every 4 days? Like it'll be a strike, then Crucible, then an adventure and then gambit?
---
Congrats - that‚Äôs some hefty climb you did there!
---
I see a fellow man of refinement. I am also very close to my 5th as well. See you out there Guardian!
---
Can relate. We finished a 4 win streak and I was on 2090. Watching that circle *almost* fill was agonising! Won the next game though, thankfully!
---
Ayyy me too
---
The riskrunner is like ur thor and ur waiting for someone to taze you so you can completely MASSACRE them and theyre friends with the biggest lightningbolt ever
---
And those are only LONH RANGE problems. The issue is that in the pvp map pool there is only 3 maps with any range (and even then its still not that far)
---
So practically its only downside is its charge rate Which only becomes when everyone rushes you from different directions
---
Don't worry, you will get there. It doesn't take long if you know what you must do (milestones that reward powerful gear).
---
I'll try to get it after I get Thorn when it comes out. Just for you!
---
Yeah I really don't get why people are complaining about the PvP part for Last Word 
---
Did you get it?

More op than eyed mask? Nah, usually us console players get dust rock blued if we even attempt a shoulder charge at a hunter. I'm not sure what it's like on pc so I'm not gonna say anything about it aside from acknowledging that titan skating exists
---
It'll probably be Rose. 
---
Geezzz. Guess I'll go find something else to do then...
---
Hot damn, which step were you at when you started? Still stuck at the first HC kills and ive been playing all of last week... 
---
I have yet to find any statement by Bungie that shows they are concerned with the basic problems in pvp. Doesn't seem like it bothers them too much (then again, I didn't really search all to long to find something). Your ideas would work but wouldn't be necessary if there was a functional matchmaking in place. 
---
How can this site avoid a libel lawsuit? 
---
Perk: turns you into a car at the end of thunder crash.
---
Yeah... lol the only thing I am worried about is the the quest itself, still at about 75% for the final blows with a hc; still have solar kills and precision kills. 
---
It isn‚Äôt easy when you‚Äôre sweating your ass off, constantly having to adapt your loadout, while also getting lockdown on midtown 3 times in a row haha
---
Ah shit man if you still have that much left you might not get it done
---
I‚Äôm a Titan by the way,also what does character boost do on my lower power level/haven‚Äôt finished main quest Warlock and Hunter?
---
Nah man you‚Äôre good, the only thing you have to worry about is getting to fabled. When the new season comes in your cruicible rank will reset but the rest of the quest won‚Äôt, so you‚Äôll still have all your other steps like precision kills saved. I‚Äôd focus on getting to fabled as fast as you can and not worrying about using solar weapons or whatever, because once you get fabled at any point it automatically completes it for your, then when your rank resets it will be easier to get kills for the other steps! Good luck
---
RNGesus is here, he says he wants his pulse rifle back.
---
I should be ok, at least I think. If not I‚Äôll just do it again next season. My mindset is that if I can get 1700 glory in only two days of comp playing, then I should have the strength mustered up to grind out kills, but it‚Äôs seriously gonna suck. Might be able to pull out a not forgotten out of my ass though since I‚Äôm 100% going to be playing past fabled rank considering I‚Äôm 400 away 
---
My shot is no where as good as it was in d1, I‚Äôm washed up as hell lmfao 
---
Thorn will be the whole meta by itself.
---
Oh yeah but will that not just be nullified by crimson users like red death did?
---
Quest is for ‚Äúcurrent season‚Äù so this is false
---
Shhhh let the new player discover this ;)
---
which tree for nova bomb?
---
Puts you back to 0 and gives you rewards.
---
Bungie need to make this real in game!
---
It really depends on the rest of your team. 
---
In general I always liked to see these things:
---
\- Ward of Dawn (Calus / bath)
---
\- Stormcaller Bottom Tree (Baths, Dogs, Calus)
---
\- Celestial Golden Gun (Everywhere)
---
\- Nova is fine
---
Thanks man. Appreciate it.

 *"Alright, I'll be right here...like it or not.*" - Cayde-6
---
 
---
Basically resets your gambit infamy back to 0 and gives you a random reward each time you rank up/reset. 
---
There‚Äôs actually a triumph I believe if you reset 3 times per season you‚Äôll be able to get a gambit emblem and also will be able to purchase the gambit shell from drifter. Reset 2 times unlocks the other weapon which will be purchasable from drifter as well. If collection and the title‚Äôs (wayfarer, dredgen, etc etc) your thing then I‚Äôd say go for it. 
---
Let's you go round the clock
---
The pass isn't a subscription. It's a one time purchase. And yes you still get new content without it. It's explained here: https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/47465
---
So if you swap weapons before your super is actually used after pulling it, it cancels the super. That part might be possible w/o macros maybe.
---
Grab 3 people to do it with, it'll breeze by. 
---
It's an interceptor, which spawn there sometimes
---
Not dps? Did you ever watch little novas flying after their prey. It is the funniest thing I have ever saw in pvp. The only thing I want for warlock is rift animations being slow af. You cant use it to save yourself both in pvp and pve. It should be like titan barrier.
---
What in the actual fuck did I just read 
---
Just to be clear, he didn't discover it.
---
##**VIDEO LINK:** https://youtu.be/EDDvjmLWfgk

&amp;nbsp;
---
Have fun.  This is about to be broken.  :~)  Titan skating is getting nerfed next week, so bring on the macro hunters.  Who would have thought?
---
Will keep this up temporarily.  I do not condone or encourage exploiting this, and am merely showcasing what was discovered.
---
Shoutout to "NAPainter" for finding it.  His video can be found here: https://youtu.be/DF_saZOeT6A
---
I used almost your exact warlock strategy on a previous run. Beat Incaru solo because I needed to clear a checkpoint (and also to see if I could even solo her), but couldn't clear Vorgeth.
---
My trouble was with the wizard group in the back of the arena. The other 3 give me little trouble but I can't seem to find any cover that allows me to effectively attack that rear group. Any advice? 
---
Wait I thought Elon Musk bought Fortnite...and deleted it... please don‚Äôt encourage him to do the same with Destiny I‚Äôm kind of fond of this game!

---
Lunafaction boots. But still less DPS I think. 
---
So it's made up. That's all you needed to say. 
---
I only use Linear. Never really.used normally ones and I have progress for it so I'm gonna say yes...
---
I dont understand why is the ctrl button on the macro
---
I just need to run it one more time but the app fire teams I've joined either stalled or never invited me. Still have to wait till Tuesday for the ship as well 
---
I can help you maybe?
---
I would love too, but 100% sure no new destinations in annual pass content
---
Nope that wasn‚Äôt my question.
---
Glad I wasn't the only one lol
---
Can't resist that upvote fishing desire
---
Damn that sucks was hoping they might add europa or a different moon in our solar system (I love astronomy and love seeing how destiny depicts the planets/moons) 
---
He does have the right to be the hunter vanguard since he killed Cayde and inherited all his belongings.
---
Like the other guy had said you have to get fabled in the current season, so if you dont finish the other parts and get fabled before march 4th you'll have to get to fabled next season too. If you're on the solar kills part when season reset happens you'll have to continue from there but you'll have to hit fabled next season since you arent currently on that step yet 
---
F
---
Have not played the blades in Gambit since they got nerfed. Before the nerf they were a DPS beast, especially with melting point. Also get used to reloading your shoot gun with the dodgey gives you instant full mag
---
Same thing happened to me yesterday (don‚Äôt know if it was because I was running around looking for the hidden eggs and bones after) but I had to do it again then it worked 
---
same! I just love new destinations in general. But be probably going to have the last dlc after annual pass with a destination. I think Europa is a Destiny 3 destination. But we might get more dlcs, rather than d3
---
Such a fitting quest name
---
What is the god roll for it because there is 2 god roll trusts imo. 
---
Ha, keep me posted!
---
Did you do it on the same character as you did before?
---
I'm having a terrible time getting gloves. 
---
Get your finger off the trigger man
---
IMO I think the Last Word was supposed to be a bit of redemption arc, where Shin is basically saying he isn't giving up on the Young Wolf.
---
FRONT PAGE
---
Stupid question im sorry, but what does the weekly singe mean?
---
Yeah he probably meant curated roll since its not randomly rolled and already masterworked, god rolls are more personal and relative to each player's style
---
Horrors Least. Pulse Rifle that exclusively drops from the Nightfall version of the Corrupted.
---
My warlock is a exo Male my titan is a exo female and my main man is a awoken male
---
Haha yeah this blew up more than I expected
---
Thanks for the laugh mate
---
Judging people by their appearance is moronic to start with, even if they are fake people in a fake world.  
---
Oh definitely, our actions against Uldren were already watched closely by Shin and we proved ourself to him, hence being given Last Wish. But I feel from a lore perspective when Uldren does show his face again, Shin will be watching very closely. Again this is all speculation, but I feel it fits very nicely to the messages from the lore cards. Perhaps we'll even have to save Uldren from the Shadows of Yor. 
---
Guaranteed the nerf coming to OEM will change the name
---
You can shoot them little novas and run away freely and trust me them rifts do nothing much other than heal you and become an easy target 
---
Well I consider them god rolls cus they're really good to me at least - so they're my God roll. But yes they're the curated roll also. Curated rolls are what bungie considers to be the god roll btw so we're both right 
---
this right after a triple slova bomb 1 phase
---
In Australia we call that a dunny flush.
---
But he's innocent compared to the old one
---
warmind legendary foregone conclusion is a good kinetic i used for the quest, energy weapons you have misfit and ye olde faithful valakadyn
---
ah sawed off shot gun
---
With the Thorn, we're always ready to kill. 
---
Elon of a thousand rockets
---
Love using mine, the ornament makes it so much less attractive so I keep mine au natural 
---
It been that way for 3 weeks \*(
---
*ohh hoooo*
---
Flair checks out.
---
Could you imagine that stoic face, set in stone, as a titan charges around the arena punching away vigorously?
---
Not trying to humble brag but I mine dropped from a random yellow bar in the first encounter. I thought it could *only* drop from the final boss. I wonder if people could farm trash mobs for it?
---
I have no idea what's going on but I love it. Party on, dudes.
---
Journey would disagree
---
That's Rlly op omegalul
---
Oh. Agreed. Just saying have fun with it while you can. 
---
Chill pill required me thinks
---
Ill enjoy exploding the head of his shoulders again. \*pats AoS\*
---
That's why I havent bothered to go from 640 to 650. I've just been stacking cores 
---
Second this, his insta and YouTube are mad funny 
---
Id shoot his ghost when it pops up to rez him too. 
---
Could be an idea for a seperate game mode though. 
---
Second portion is incorrect. As a fellow lore nerd. Due to the vanguard dare he inherits the shit. 
---
Had the same issue - solution is to just wait. It actually does continue the update in the background but the progression bar is stuck. 
---
Wouldn't even make sense for the exotic swords from D1 to return without being reworked.  Black Talon does the exact same thing as Bolt-Caster and Raze Lighter would need a brand new powered attack because all swords in D2 can uppercut.   The only one that could probably return without change is Dark Drinker, but if I had to be honest the Worldline Zero's Tesseract attack is fairly similar to the Dark Drinker's whirlwind slash attack.  
---
The bar was full, it was the last section, sort of like a 99% complete bar. Been waiting around for ages :( 
---
Everyone first thinks about the song.
---
Then they remember the *true* reference...
---
MEAT SPIN
---
It's like a basketball draining the hoop at the buzzer of some sports highlight
---
I wish the ornament would bring the audio bug back so we could truly have one terrible scream
---
Which sucks cuz it hasn‚Äôt been the nightfall for weeks. 
---
Looks at calender hey its not saturday get outa the bath 
---
Ive wiped entire teams with one burst from this thing, its amazing
---
Nah dude we straight up saw Uldren be resurrected.
---
Assuming he had time or knowledge to make his own Dare.
---
It is slow atm and will change next week.

 411.3K  in PVP
---
 483.6K  in PvE
---
Numbers from Destinytracker. 
---
Particle Accelerator?
---
But it doesn‚Äôt seem to roll with trench barrel according to that light.gg link
---
Strange, according to light.gg year 1 nightshade didn't have Under Pressure, but nightshade in collections does. Also, other guns with year 1 and year 2 versions have both listed separately in collections, with only the year 1 being craftable. 
---
HOLY SHIT THATS BEAUTIFUL 
---
I just got this game recently. Now at power level 400 and about to be level/rank 50. I'm at the part in forsaken where I said the Barrons and I cannot beat The Fanatic and his pal there. They're just too damn tough.
---
So I figure I have to get to rank 50 and maybe 500 power?  
---
At this point I was going to go back to the various planets and do any adventures or missions, anything. It's cool cause I like that stuff a lot anyway, I like exploring. 
---
Any tips though on what activities will drop me or at least have more chances of dropping me exotics and good legendaries in terms of weapons and gear?  
---
Also, anything I should do/get before the end of this season in the game?  
---
Finally, I have 1k silver from buying the complete edition of d2, any suggestion for what I should spend it on?  
---
Any tips would be great on anything, thanks guys. 
---
Yeah I saw it and people already commented on it
---
Ah, then it wasnt just a grind for light Vs light then! 
---
I bought my wayfarer like 2 weeks ago.
---
I figured it would be here sooner :(
---
Alright alright alright 
---
Come on really? You know the answer.
---
No actually, I dont ever use rocket launchers, so I dont.
---
Go big or go home! In this case though, both.
---
It only drops from spider bounties
---
Eh. He could do an Ana Bray.
---
What is with neckbeards having to prove they know about trigger discipline when you're holding a foam gun. 
---
I seriously can‚Äôt wait for this expansion to start.
---
Indeed.
---
Just discovered that this info means that I'll get Wayfarer a week or so before the rewards program expires, so I'll still be able to get a Wayfarer Medal
---
Looks like a scout to me
---
Free two day Exotic shipping if you sign up for 1,499 Legendary Shards!
---
Still seems like too much trouble
---
Is your name really EATEROFSAND?
---
That just made the video 10x better. Thank you, my hungover self needed a good laugh today. 
---
What can I say, it‚Äôs tasty üòã 
---
Glad I could make you laugh a bit. 
---
Oh my god. Please do this and please tell us about it.
---
War frame and Destiny 2, love both. Warframe is very off and on for me, play it for weeks and drop it for months, then repeat. Been playing destiny 2 for months now 
---
Anyone else gonna be decked out in glowing armor soon?
---
I might actually have a reason to play Gambit now.
---
That's cause Arc hunter is trash. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
I do the exact same thing with Warframe 
---
Had one in Volundr just stick to the ceiling of the cave once
---
Singe does not do enough to make me us the arc strider, I hate that sub-class so its either golden gun or teather.
---
Same for my warlock Dawn Blade or Nova Bomb.
---
March 12th can‚Äôt come any sooner. I don‚Äôt plan on turning off my PC until I finish the questüò≠
---
Destiny is fun. How? Just don't take it seriously. Salty people in PvP ain't having fun.
---
That emerald green tho
---
Well, the Drifter is old enough he might be one of the original dredgen and likely knew Yor personally.
---
If your going 2500,000+ then list the modifiers.
---
Yes but Anthem has my attention. Destiny will have my attention next week.
---
Ugh still need the shader and the jutonn hopefully rng blessed u after that with the exotic
---
agreed, I almost permanently quit d2 becuase I have to buy annual pass to get TLW but I just stick to Ace.
---
I would've cried if it died and I didnt get it. I did, however, get mine finally last night with 2 friends, on second try and had 30 seconds to spare which was a close enough call for me. So happy I got it though. Dont even care about getting catalyst yet
---
That's a tough one. I'd say outlaw + moving target, because box breathing only lasts for one shot and you have to aim and not shoot for a while. The rapid hit + box breathing one is better for tougher enemies, so if I were you I would put major spec on that one, and use the outlaw + moving target one for minor enemies. 
---
I have no feelings one way or the other
---
Neither
---
Holy crap... the deception possibilities with that armor.  Lets say you are in a squad and you have your invader put the mote collector shader on their gear.
---
Finally, something I can relate to
---
Annual pass is worth it though, especially after I saw the new ViDoc you can clearly tell bungie is starting to shine without activision, hopefully itll only get better.
---
very sawed off
---
Exactly.  See, thats where I gave up.  They may very well end up having a great explanation, but I just couldn't be bothered to wait a decade to find out, you know.  because yeah, that could happen, or, they could just crash and burn and there go hundreds of my dollars to get to an underwhelming conclusion. 
---
Doesn't matter gonna punch him....punch him real hard in the face.  
---
Did he say Season of Opulence? Right towards the end.
---
i think you forgot couple zeroes..
---
here you go buddy: 0000000000000
---
for the next time remember, i can't be there picking up all the stuff you forget around here ;)
---
It is an ornament for a pre existing gambit emblem. It took me a bit to figure that one out before.
---
This happened in my bergusia run the other day.  Got myself in a bit if a pickle staring at it...
---
Lol now you know the guy who's gonna lose 15 motes before the game even starts, because he'll be decked out in that white.
---
I'm curious if there's going to be matchmaking for Reckoning. 
---
Agreed.
---
I hate where they starting to play like EA. base game? $60 on campaign. Oh so you LIKE the game? wanna play another campaign with your fav NPC and gets new bunch of gears and unlock light cap? $60. OH so you beat the damn DLC and cleared the campaign? here some new gear $60. tbh, Destiny isn't that expensive but it's still money. I'd love to pay $60 and get constant update and new content without opening my wallet. 
---
I want the helmet and the arms for Titan, and I'll be happy.
---
Check back around Destiny 3 and you might have some luck ;)
---
Welcome to the Burger Forge may I take your order 
---
Yes I‚Äôll have one Large J√∂tunn and a medium side of Curated Kindled Orchid please and thank you 
---
You know it!
---
I‚Äôm sorry, this is r/Destiny2
---
Drifter on your mind, bring some kleenex
---
I would like to do Nightfalls and older Raids. I missed every raid except the first one. If possible, I'd like to do one area at a time and work with a group of people who are okay with limiting our play to an hour or an hour and a half. I have an hour after work a few days a week and possibly longer on Sunday nights.
---
Dude read the lore there's shit tons of story 
---
The box breathing one is the counter to lunas in the crucible, I have that same role and it dominates in Crucible, although you are a bit vulnerable when scoped in waiting for box breathing.
---
I think he's Dredgen Yor. I know Shin Malphur killed him but Yor still has a ghost, he only sent his ghost away to remind people of the good that was Rezyl Azzir (his name before he became Yor), it's speculative but his ghost could have gone back to revive him at some point for some reason. 
---
I mean who wouldn't be terrified of a little pink puffball floating its way to extinguish your light?
---
100k scores are almost soloable now, I basically post just to help finish it fastrr
---
How can you get yourself to use a weapon so long
---
That's exactly why I join other people, cause I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. Also typing all that stuff out on xbox is tedious 
---
He wasn't controlled. He was seduced. His actions were still his own. 
---
Could be that avalanche reskin I‚Äôm a little surprised they didn‚Äôt go more in detail 
---
If you mean Breakneck, an auto rifle with rampage and a perk that accelerates rate of fire after kills.
---
Nah, the jokers wild one. I have bn already. Worth the grind
---
I can already hear them. Their wails provide the white noise that helps me sleep at night. 
---
I'm way more interested in the Drifter than that hidden forge nonsense. 
---
Bungie doesn't even know you exist 
---
Get better???
---
The armor looks amazing 
---
Dude! This is fantastic! I‚Äôve had people ask me about the super abilities and I can never remember them all.
---
Its a meme, why are you butthurt
---
I like using jotunn in volundr, won‚Äôt mind grinding this out.
---
Not looking forward to doing the izanagi or le monarque at all though...
---
Hunter : Awoken Female
---
Titan : Awoken Female
---
Warlock : Awoken Male
---
I found the awokens very interseting. And I don't know if the other awokens names you ''cousin'' if you're human or exo, but I like it !
---
Hey man, 
---
I also do destiny props, and if you need help with anything i'd be more than happy to share some of my expertise!
---
Most of my stuff is on r/lasrig
---
It is not what Cayde wanted.  He wanted his belonging to go to the person who killed him, not his title.  The Hunter Dare isn't "if you kill me, you get my job" and never was.  It was a bet between hunters where, basically, whoever died "won" and wasn't responsible for Vanguard duties, while the survivor 'lost' and became Hunter vanguard.
---
Considering Uldren was neither Hunter or Guardian when he killed Cayde, it would make absolutely zero sense for him to fulfill Vanguard duties.
---
Because it sucks and isn't funny or witty. Quit thinking about my butt fruit loop
---
‚ÄúActivate Windows‚Äù
---
Nah it's funny
---
Oh course yeah. It's pointless talking any further to you because you seem to be arguing for the sake of it. But I guess this is Reddit.
---
To a child, probably. After age 15, not so much 
---
And this is how racism works... lol.
---
Its fatal
---
I haven't seen it before regardless it's a good meme.
---
Funny thing is, when that came out, there was someone that posted on here that they wanted it added. That's awesome that they actually added it
---
Good thing I'm fifteen!
---
For the grind I did for breakneck I honestly find my tigerspite to be better probably an unpopular opinion but honestly breakneck has been in my vault pretty much straight after I got it I hope these new ones are better 
---
I can tell
---
do you even know why am I complaining?
---
@Th3_Shr00m
---
Wrong. Auto rifle was revealed before :)
---
Yup
---
You could just be bad at crucible and like to complain about things
---
Cayde: Hey uh guardian, before you go..
---
Could you do my taxes?
---
I personally prefer the taste of lint with a side of glue, but to each their own I guess
---
You need to go deeper my dude
---
How is my skill in the crucible anything to do with the abilities of subclasses? The shield has tracking that you can bounce it off multiple surfaces and it will follow you. 
---
If I have 14 motes, I'll only go for 15 I'd I hear the invader spawn. I figure someone else will be going after him, so I'm free to scofe more motes.
---
*claps fists aggressively*
---
You‚Äôd think our armour would be engineered well enough to withstand blunt-force trauma, but I guess not. 
---
Can I get the template too, please?
---
Lfg
---
I love Gambit
---
Lemonade wasn't so bad it never ran out of ammo. For j√∂tunn i had a bunch of fusion reserves and ammo finder equipped and when i got found ammo it was good, but it ran out, and i had to run around killing everything hoping something would drop some.
---
Sorry, your submission has been automatically removed. 
---
It appears you are asking a question about Destiny 2 error codes or a bug. 
---
We suggest Google searching your error code for more information about what you might be experiencing, or posting in /r/DestinyTechSupport
---
I would hope most everyone at this point.
---
See you posted it 3x, it has exactly 0 upvotes.  Maybe I'm right kid. Good day to you 
---
The Vanguard isn‚Äôt the only thing that‚Äôs dead...
---
(#ripCayde
---
The amount of times this happens is unbelievable üòÇ
---
Lol. Because nothing else has tracking. 
---
Hate it too
---
I liked the D1 gear sets as much as the next person. I like the D2 gear sets.
---
However, I don't like when everyone uses the WotM gear set as an example. I thought that was the WORST gear set. Hunter looked so ugly.
---
Age of Triumph Crota gear with ornaments was the best looking set of gear in all of Destiny.
---
He was right about post-birth abortion though.
---
Why do you hate it?
---
Izinami stuck in the frame arm lol 
---
Name that shader
---
Would be nice to pick a role and receive its specific benefits.  
---
For example, collector can hold more motes at the same time, invader is the only one who has overshield when invading, sentry receives damage bonus vs blockers and invader, reaper takes less damage from adds.  
---
Something like that.  
---
Nice
---
Breakneck is the best kinetic auto rifle there is
---
Just throw new gear in your vault, youll still level up
---
Good thing you have a ton of pve content to level in too!
---
do you guys think this is something people could get banned for? i worry about whatever systems bungo might have in place to auto-detect people traveling like this, or staying in the air for that long. 
---
don't get me wrong, i am very much looking forward to using this for fun - i think it could be a super cool way to explore new areas from the sky, and i think it could be neat for finding ways through certain places. 
---
i hope it isn't abused in PvP, but i'm sure people will (unfortunately) find a way to implement it for an advantage.
---
Expect numerous shitposts whining about the quest steps and posts about "FINALLY!" receiving the gun.
---
I hope you never get into a real MMO, haha.  People are paying upwards of $30 for a cosmetic mount in the game I play.  
---
The bottom line really, as much as we don't like it, is that DLC is going to cost money, because employees need to be paid.  It's either that or raise base prices of games which we also don't like.  Expecting someone to churn out content for a game for 3 years that you paid $60 for is kinda dreaming.  Not saying I like it but that's the business.
---
2x 31 upvotes and only posted it a second time because I found out about this sub while looking for a destiny meme sub you must be a genius, let me and my meme be you giant ass baby
---
You‚Äôre probably still doomed considering you don‚Äôt have any of the cosmetics and I‚Äôve done every ascendent challenge and every shattered throne since they‚Äôve been available and still don‚Äôt have them 
---
Swarm of deals approaching
---
&gt; Lol. Because nothing else has tracking. 
---
So?? What does this have to do with what I'm talking about?
---
You have 0 upvotes, stop lying 
---
*me still having fun
---
If Bungie added the animation without telling anyone, guaranteed 90 % player base would come back just to trip on it.
---
Every COD ever with these Dumb skins you can buy. . .
---
I said it above but real MMOs are by far the worst offenders.  Destiny isn't even close.
---
EA's loot boxes and free DLC is damage control to almost of all of their releases critically crapping the bed.  They aren't "getting better," it's all corporate calculations, dude.
---
Thanks for the chuckle. 
---
I got about 60 out of 5k seeds sooo, yeah, you are probably gonna get more than one
---
I already am?
---
Thats why im recommending it?
---
Your efforts are adorable.
---
Have a good day
