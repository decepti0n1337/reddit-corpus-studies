Cabal Policy in a nutshell: 'All your planets are belong to us now."
---
---
---
For vanguard strikes, I tend to just use whatever I‚Äôm enjoying. Usually a hand cannon or pulse rifle. Secondaries are usually recluse or some sniper
---

---
PVP on the other hand, I enjoy using hand cannons and pulse rifles 
---
**Primaries**
---
Claws of the wolf (iron banner) Outbreak Perfected, and Redrix‚Äôs broadsword.
---
For HCs I like using thorn, trust, austringer and spare rations.
---
**Secondaries**
---
Mainly use snipers, or SMGs
---
For snipers I‚Äôd recommend Beloved, Izanagis burden, Tranquility, and revoker
---
SMGs I use are mainly Recluse, bug out bag and Calus mini tool.
---
Hope this helped, these are my preferences although they aren‚Äôt very broad.
---
I got it up to 9/20 but Bungie should accept all daily bounties and get it out the way. All this daily bounty drama is killing me.
---
By denting it
---
*phew* you scared me for a bit there. I forgot about the lore books from VO, but turns out I already have them.
---
Beautiful work! Please do Dark Souls when you are able too! They would be EPIC!
---
"I'm in danger!"
---
That's one of the downside of trying to do the season 8 Gambit quest... Even though teammate kills count towards progress, guarding the portal and invade whenever is the only way to guarantee kills
---
[https://www.pcgamer.com/how-to-get-izanagis-burden-in-destiny-2/](https://www.pcgamer.com/how-to-get-izanagis-burden-in-destiny-2/) You will want to start doing this on all 3 characters to make farming the rare bounty required faster. Additionally take this chance to start the quests to get J√∂tunn and Le Monarque (you need to complete 2 different legendary weapon frames a week for 5 weeks (does not need to be in a row though)

Tired of seeing Recluse all the time) despite still being among the top tier SMGs.

---
Beloved is from Menagerie. Jubilation rune + any red rune + any rune (last rune affects the masterwork stat it will have)
---
Spare Rations is from Gambit Prime
---
Mindbender's Ambition is from the "The Hollowed Lair" Nightfall Strike.
---
Try on Nessus. I can‚Äôt remember it‚Äôs name but it‚Äôs the underground area in between the public event area and the adventure. There‚Äôs a cave where they will constantly respawn
---
It's a shame we couldn't get a titan like him as our leader rather than Zavala
---
10/10 IGN   Would  h a h a  again
---
Really anywhere there's lots of adds. Altar of sorrow works as lots of people are still doing it and if all you do is plink acolytes, you're still helping by adding time
---
I hope you don't get to vexed by some of these more complex jokes. 
---
I'd really like to win the code, but I bet it's already taken. 
---
I hope to don't scorn me for these bad puns.
---
The quality of these has really fallen.
---
Don't get too enthralled with these, writing these puns makes me want to shriek.
---
The description of the node key should give you a hint to the location.
---
For hand cannons most work well in both tbh. A lot will depend on the roll of the random perks (rangefinder, kill clip, outlaw, etc)
---
Exotics - sunspot, cayde, last word (more pvp focus)
---
Legendaries: spare rations, duke mk44 (prob also pvp focused), optative isn‚Äôt bad, others I can‚Äôt think of off the cuff
---
My austringer is a go to for pve for me (outlaw rampage range masterwork). Some don‚Äôt like it because of the type of hand cannon but it works great for me. Super easy to grind for too since you can target it in managerie. 
---
*Edit: For some reason I read handcannons in your post but must have totally misread. The rest got u with the right loadouts with everything lol
---
The only thing you can do for higher gear is any activity that gives you pinnacle gear.
---
Pinnacle gear is the only thing that gives you war above 950
---
Warlocks may not have a one shot melee ability but they have a one shot grenade ability.
---
The dreaming city and precursor Mercury are the nicest looking places IMO
---
"His Light cast no shadows."
---
sorry your (and many others i‚Äôm sure) experience with that weapon seemed that grindy. for me it was actually fine. i just grounded for mountaintop this season so i got my medals that way and since i love the fighting lion, it was pretty easy. i got the points just in regular crucible over time and when i wanted randy‚Äôs a few days ago, i finished the scout kills with some legendary 150 rpm scout.
---
Thanks, did not know that.
---
13 and VoG
---
Thanks, just gonna not stress it and just redo it next season.
---
Vai em paz guardi√£o üñ§
---
The term "Blueberry" goes as far as the older entries of the Battlefield series as they are the people you are not in a Squad with, people that you don't communicate with and usually do a lot of dumb unhelpful shit, unlike your squad that you communicate constantly with.  
---
The same concept applies to Destiny as teammates you know nothing of are marked in blue, and people in your fireteam are green.
---
Yeah, most of it was spent learning the maps, what guns are good and trying to not forget to use a handgun as a sniper. üòë
---
&gt;Gets killed by truth, drop the 1 mote we needed to summon
---
Or Xenophage, or Izanagi's, or Hammerhead, or Recluse, or Thunderlord, or WoTW.
---
forgot the n in only XD
---
different impact. high impact= more damage/shot but slower firerate. and stop playing double primary. this is the worst combo, if you want dps
---
i‚Äôve been playing since d1 y1 and i‚Äôve gotten more than i could remember. you‚Äôll get them
---
Do forsaken for ace last word and thorn and others such as jotunn and do warmind for sleeper and polaris
---
Altars of sorrow, best way easily
---
Thanks but just will try next season now that I am a bit better. Can't really spend 8 hours farming today. Hopefully the nerfs will help too.
---
Use weapons to kill things, you'll thank me later.
---
If i ever run Barrage its almost always to counter Roaming supers.  I'd be lying if I said I hadn't solo barraged someone before though.   Sometimes its just "Been sitting on it so long I could have used 2 by now" moment.
---
All versions of shadowkeep come with this seasons pass
---
This is the ‚Äúthough fools seldom differ‚Äù part
---
Tip: add people that plays at the same level as you ingame, and ask if they want to team up.
---
When i had to 3v6 a 6-stack of drb and nf hunters
---
Get literally thousands of mats from all the locations and cores and go see banshee
---
True
---
How many time did u played to get 5500 materials? Did u get it just doing his bounties? Which way did y made it?
---
but saint-14 isnt a hypocrite who at one point said that he needed to deal with the prison of elders escapees(yes all 600,000,000,000,001 of them) only to COMPLETELY IGNORE THE MASSIVE THREAT TO THE TOWER SO HE CAN CONTINUE TO WATCH SOME FUCKING TURTLES... sorry im just really pissed that he was willing to allow an army of psychos with bombs of every shape and size to continue to be a threat so he can continue to watch A BUNCH OF FUCKING TURTLES... seriously what do you think is more dangerous a small army of space turtles with gasoline for blood who are a greater danger to themselves because of the fact that they use flamethrowers despite having highly flamable ship fuel for blood... or a fuckton of spiders with nukes
---
It's the end of the season so that probably makes it worse. All those that just needed 2100 to go for pinnacle weapons have been and gone Peace-Out!
---
All that is left is hard-core and those just starting and trying to eke out 2100 before season's end.
---
Many teams will be one high rank and 2 low rank vs a team of the same - or as close as possible. 
---
You'd hope that at least one blueberry tries to be a good team mate - lets the better player grab heavy, provides cover fire, uses their Super to shutdown another super and prevent your team getting wiped etc.
---
I've decided to stop and return to the Luna's grind next season when the lobbies fill up again with players more at my level (potato-class). Glad I got the other pinnacles out of the way though, even though it took most of the rest of the season. Redrix, Recluse, Mountaintop, Revoker, Randy's.
---
The Texans wouldn‚Äôt burn oil?
---
[deleted]
---
what do you use?
---
Amazingly?
---
*Me, a Sniper/Riskrunner Lion Rampant Titan:*
---
:(
---
Honestly just play the game
---
After enough packages there is just no reason to turn them in anymore honestly, so you just hoard them. I have like 3500 right now. But it you're new bounties are the best way to get them. The strikes you do while you complete the bounties also give a few tokens as well
---
There are a lot. Can you elaborate?
---
You‚Äôre fools if you think it was the overshield alone that made OEM potent! lol
---
Oh sorry I meant exotic
---
looks like he is wearing one-eyed mask
---
Thanks for the input my dude lol
---
Expect one a month roughly .... *they are rare* lol
---
Powerful gear will go up to 960 starting tomorrow, so don't worry about it yet.
---
This is the way
---
Kindled Orchid (140 rpm) can be acquired through black armory frames. I have a rapid hit kill clip one with a range masterwork that is just amazing. Also waking vigil (150 rpm) can be acquired through the menagerie or bounties in the dreaming city. Trust from gambit (180 rpm), spare rations from reckoning (150 rpm). All great guns.
---
Can you get the quest line or is it only in drops?
---
why do people on this sub always ask really dumb questions
---
Only in drops now.
---
OOOH That smells good
---
Osiris is the most chad guardian ever.
---
He literally invented a time machine in order to bring his friend back from the dead.
---
Wlhile plaing top oem titan
---
Hmm I see
---
Do eet!
---
Why does it burn when I pee....?
---
I'm mad lol I just got back on destiny when I saw they were launching shadow keep I thought I would get on and finish the forsaken quest only to find out MY QUEST WERE DONE. What in the world I heck I then googled to see if I was stupid and didn't see to find out that was the intention. Thank you for clearing up what mess they made I'm now never playing the game again. Well because there is none.
---
Is the Eriana‚Äôs catalyst quest going away?
---
Because you‚Äôre not punching things hard enough, Titan.
---
Well then, you're living in your parent's house without contributing to housework.
---
I wouldn't be complaining about having to sign out of a *game*.
---
5500
---
Mid solar hunter
---
Austringer (1100 kills) Beloved (700 kills) Hammerhead (270 kills)
---
Thanks!!
---
Well done! Also, love that gamer tag lol
---
Thought the same thing. It's like they cannot shoot and move at the same time. And they just stood there in the open too! What a weird match.
---
or perhaps blows?
---
Go to leviathan.  Use a trace rifle.  Line up the cabal guards.  Kill multiple in one shot.  Rinse, repeat.  Each beam-in given you more ammo.
---
How do youveven do that?
---
 The tombstone emote and the selfie emote.
---
I have fond memories of a Hunter trying to snipe me in Survival with Wish-Ender. He had two layers of wallhacks, radar invisibility from crouching, and a slight high ground advantage, and I still outsniped him with Izanagi.
---
r/okbuddyvanguard
---
either destiny or borderlands
---
Pre-shadowkeep you didn't have access to the tower or anything until you completed the Red War campaign, but now that they've made the campaigns optional I can see how it'd be confusing.
---
I suck at gathering motes. Because I'm sure that I'll drop them trying to kill that thicc shiny ass. Or just some thicc ass. So fuck you. I'm gonna sit at that fucking portal, kill blockers and wait for it to open.
---
Looks like Garden of Salvation.
---
The red war was the original story of destiny 2 but don‚Äôt really know how to access it with the new light expansion
---
Got loads of friends to play it with, just none of them want to use rat king xD
---
handheld supernova is only op because you van combine it with oppressive darkness, which is going away
---
IV said this on a different post to a different price of art and I'll say it again MAKE.. ME.. A.. POSTER!!!! I want to look up occasionally from titaning and be inspired!!!
---
It gives wallhacks, damage, heal and over shield
---
The only counters are not shooting the Titan or one shotting it.
---
It's fucking busted
---
*Vex Chassis Components*
---
Cayde's out there somewhere right now, going on another run with Andal. If we bring back Cayde, we'd only be taking him away from his glory days.
---
It‚Äôs on a daily rotation. The hardest part is the rare bounty, and if you get one early, just don‚Äôt turn it in.
---
ARE THERE ANY THAT ARE PISTER SIZED!!!
---
In my two years of playing not once have I encounterd a hacker it's just bad luck man
---
Handheld Supernova isn't even OP...
---
Cannot say I‚Äôve seen the same, ever
---
I'm stuck at the rare bounty step. I don't understand if I'm supposed to take ada bounties, complete them and hope for them to drop, or keep spamming forges until it drops at the end?
---
And if only we could go complete shattered throne, and pyramidian while having that rng hell for the bounty..
---
Go talk to Amanda holliday
---
It is- It‚Äôs the area with the first secret chest before the diamond.
---
*VEX ON THE FIELD*
---
I haven't even used OEM or recluse in anything but private match since before shadow keep
---
We raid for the last crayon
---
I'm playing MC with kinderguardian weapons when bored
---
I‚Äôve seen people (and done it myself) have a lot of luck with turning in multiple bounties at once. So finish like 8 of the daily‚Äôs and maybe a weekly and collect them all.
---
For all players trying to get Izanagis and is turned off by "impossible to get", just log in daily and grab the key from each forge while doing bounties, and when you get a rare bounty grind it out if you insist on getting it asap, but you have 10 days from the time you get the rare. It's not that hard or "impossible" in anyway.
---
Nice! What shader is this btw?
---
Yeah you good bro if anything now is the perfect time
---
You made me snarf.
---
He's our God. We must worship him. Now pray with us you heretic.
---
It wasn't the gun that killed you.
---
It was the skilled guy using it.
---
Boi I got that thing back in black armory and I ain't even a hard core player
---
They progress a completion bar in Ikora's icon.  At 100% she gives you a powerful.
---
His power level was 999, season rank 1123 when he solod dul incaru. Apparently averaged 18 hours a day up until that point
---
how about a jesus shirt?
---
At least my life isn't so sad I go hating people
---
What? Tomorrow guy.
---
Third time today, POSTER... I NEED IT!!!
---
It's not about the weapons you've got, it's about the feats you perform. Consider all the things you achieve through campaigns and raids.  You hear of some other guardians performing similar feats, but not many.
---
Given that the shield stay up after you destroy the crystals, I don't think they're powering the shields.  Especially since the altars that we destroy, that appear to be generating the shields, don't seem to have any connection to the crystals.  Also, we know the primary purpose of the light harvesting is the summoning.  The reappearance after dropping the charges off the edge is just a gameplay necessity.
---
No.
---
A little background:
---
We matched with a random who after the first round, inexplicably left. No idea why. Might have been a connection issue.
---
So my Son and I were now a man down. In other modes, this might have been a big issue. Not so much in Survival provided you play together and play smart.
---
Keep out of tight engagements.
---
Communicate.
---
Have each other‚Äôs backs (my 10 vs his 22 wasn‚Äôt a true reflection as he happened to get the final blow).
---
Remember the objectives of heavy ammo, life-advantage and tie-breaker.
---
Above all, don‚Äôt panic. We were 4 - 1 up on life advantage in one round, with 20 seconds to go. Even though one of them used their super and killed us both, we were still 2 - 1 up. The respawn timer wears down a few seconds as well as going to a different part of the map when you return, so at that point it‚Äôs all about being smart and keeping safe for the last 10 seconds or so.
---
Sometimes the biggest opponent is the random who needlessly runs in and just consumes your lives. I‚Äôm not saying that‚Äôs the case here, but we‚Äôve been in a few games where we were 2-1 up on life advantage and the random decides to push with 3 seconds on the clock, dies, and forces the tie-breaker.
---
It was hands-down our best game of the night!
---
I'm a goose I guess
---
Yeah... I was playing with my friend and it was actually easier without randoms...
---
That's an amazing piece
---
Check the postmaster. It should be there.
---
if anything, the sundial is like the vex mind that killed saint. Specifically made to hone in on saint's light and only his light.
---
I enjoyed racking up some solar and machine gun strike kills but otherwise was a bit miffed.
---
Turtles definitely. Looks like TMNT merged with Destiny. Bro did you see those turtles? They destroy huge robot dogs with rockets and shit with only wood on their hands. Like I dont get how they deal damage to titanium alloy with nunchucks and katanas. I reckon those are all special exotics.
---
bro üòéüí™
---
Wtf I just posted it like 1 second ago are you stalking me.
---
Start looking for a new girl friend
---
This got gold and I am perfectly fine with that.
---
Yep. You get the same amount of lives as if you were a 3 man team, which gives you breathing space. Not having that random go through life after life is a bonus.
---
It‚Äôs a psion!
---
Bring cayde back
---
I‚Äôve always wondered why his helm always had the end of a broom on it.
---
The super for middle tree void warlock is the worst part of the subclass. It's range and consistency aren't great but what it lacks in super ability it makes up for with handheld supernova. The exotics I would recommend would be transversive steps, contraverse hold, or ohpidian aspects. I would maximize discipline and recovery as far as stats go for that build. One helpful tip for HHSN is that it has an insane range, roughly the same range as a long range Chaperone headshot. But past that it fits an aggressive playstyle fairly well. Happy hunting guardian. :)
---
How about for the dark side you just do some messed up shit.
---
He can't come back via Osiris' method anyway (not that it helps any).  Sagira deliberately makes Osiris say, out loud, that it wouldn't work a second time if it worked at all, and Cayde's death occurred extremely far away from any sort of Vex installation or simulation.  
---
Also, if it's any consolation, Ikora would agree with you.  She brings up Cayde as a rejection of Osiris' argument that "Saint deserves another chance."
---
Why should I slow down while enjoying a game? When I play with my friends time just flies by. You want me to stop in the middle of a funny session just so Bungie can make it feel like the content is longer? And dont worry I already have backup plan.
---
I got to 260. Wasn‚Äôt really grinding after I hit 100, it just kinda happened. Ended up with a +22 for the season. Gonna miss that boost come tomorrow morning.
---
Except bungies a smaller studio with way less resources and a much smaller team working on bigger things rn
---
Happy noodle day
---
Whether we wanted it or not
---
If youre talkin PS4 then ask Sony, theyll say theyre open to more games being crossplay, and then wont actually let devs do it
---
Very nice although it drives me a little mad that you don‚Äôt have a headset stand but otherwise loving it
---
Yeah you are right :D, I‚Äôm gmt +1 and could help to at 21:00
---
As long as our bank is clear of blockers I'll defend your right to sit at our portal to the death.
---
I don‚Äôt see liars here. Thought it would be a nice exotic for hunters.
---
good riddance filithy titans
---
I tried that once, it was a shitty experience.
---
Tried again and people expected me to kwtd, I said I watched videos of it, it turned out it was not enough, so I forgot about those guns and have been playing the game as a single player experience since.
---
Then it loses flavour though. The point of Gambit is that it's a PvPvE mode.
---
but where's your gun on that picture? this game needs a photo mode asap!
---
Yeah but they‚Äôre 150s now
---
It's the perks that matter .
---
Striker.exe has stopped working and must close.
---
I wish I had talent :'(
---
It took me 200 daily black armoury bounties (every bounty for 7 weeks) to get my rare bounty.  The drop rate is really poor.
---
getting to 950 was easy enough this Season, but to Level second/third char was even easier. happy Season of dawn Guardians.
---
Never owned a Recluse, but I love running Riskrunner in PvE. That along with Dunemarchers and Arc abilities makes for a fun light show
---
Took out any umm.. gods lately?
---
Allrighty then no worries
---
OEM Santa brings no presents, only salt.
---
I frigging hate this arena for that very reason. It really highlights my poor sense of spatial awareness.
---
Congrats man , got to 3k this past season will definitely get my 5500 this season
---
I'm poor so here's your gold üèÖ
---
Skill based match making is on. So dont worry about dragging your team. Play control. Nobody will get mad if you play poorly there. And if they do then theyre salty children. Control is where you go to test things or get quests/bountys done.
---
The old D1 armor pepehands
---
Recluse for virgins
---
Riskrunner for chads
---
Ok boomer
---
Im gmt-8 so I'll likely be asleep at that time considering its 1:30 right now here x.x

hmm it  like the light being sucked

*Marked For Vengeance*
---
Even with a bloody SIDEARM I can one-shot the shanks, they really are a joke
---
Weak clip
---
Prime or from like raids or something
---
The gun and your hand show up like normal. The way i get "photo mode" style screen shots is that when you swap weapons there's a very brief moment nothing at all shows up. I just grab a screen cap during that brief moment.
---
Then its not cayde anymore. Just go outside and tell a random woman shes actually your mom from amother life who just forgot everything....
---
Pretty sure it would not work
---
Had a teammate once who would just scoop the portal, but everytime he did, he was getting team wipes with thunderlord
---
??
---
Sure. Save away, my friend. üòä
---
Not prime, but yes, raid gear is an example.
---
pretty sure ther sacrifice turned it from an endgame raid into a basic bitch strike for us.
---
Nahh, i heard he is pre lubing his ass
---
Lol this is just gameplay my dude none spectacular but I‚Äôll give you an upvote as it appears that this was cool to you üòé
---
It's not a bug, the quest tells u to kill the knights. But yeah it's a pain this way.
---
Buddy. Ya hate to see it
---
Cool, it looked good so I assumed they were charging a boatload of money for it
---
"Colour channels"? √í-√µ
---
The reason is that there are 3 big knights that you need to kill to get the last word.
---
That's so true, when I first obtained the "Raiden in a Gun", I thought the Arc Conductor visual effect was the game bugging out
---
Vex #1: This is... so dumb.
---
Vex #2: The higher I am the better I can see.
---
Check ur DMS!

Dm's
---
Zavala deserves true peace when his time comes. Its just a damn shame he will never see it.
---
Does it work on truth?
---
I love using this on my hunter with ophidia spathe. Knife trick for days!
---
We lost btw
---
I would award you if I could.
---
Great art as usual and keep up the good work.
---
Started as new light with no friends to play with, now I am leader of ~50 members clan with nice player group going :)
---
Now THAT is a big brain move
---
Also the moon in Altar of Sorrows.
---
I was alarmed at first as I thought you placed the screen above a fireplace
---
Man. I'm not even sure if I can handle another title grind. That Randy's Throwing Knife really made me hate myself for awhile.
---
It's a gun that gives crit damage for not hitting crit spots.  In a game about shooting crit spots.  
---
In an fps this is literally the definition of OP or game breaking or honestly just fucking *dumb* development.
---
It's like the epitome of hand holding.  
---
Imagine a sniper that gave crit dmg for shooting a foot.  That's recluse.  Imagine Lunas howl proccing off body shots...from your other fucking guns. Recluse.
---
It's so mind numbingly brain dead easy as fuck to use I seriously do not remember the last time I saw somebody use something else.  
---
Welcome to recluse the game where bypassing the crit mechanic is so overwhelmingly broken you'd be dumb to use any weapon that requires actually aiming.  And if you try to, gl being invited to a raid or comp team, they can't possibly comprehend not using this weapon.
---
Come on and slam, and welcome to the jam!
---
*that is his face*
---
 he is one with the Traveler now..
---
May his kinderguardians light the World as he once did
---
Memes are really going down hill.
---
Oof, I turned in like 16-17 bounties to get mine. Which was also the complete 5 Forges at maximum temper rare bounty. Seems the game was extremely nice to me after reading all of these stories
---
You either stop now or go for 420, nothing else matters
---
Yeah been stomped into an invasion once or twice.. love it when you are not set up for invading at all so u end up dying rather then contributing to your team
---
99.9% of recluse users use recluse because they can't reliably hit headshots but still need the crit multiplier to be able to clear encounters.  
---
They're the kind of people that shoot a vex goblin in the head with a hand cannon on 950 and wonder why their full clip can't melt a red bar like their hand holding recluse.
---
I don't usually like hunter armor sets but damn I guess I'll be spending more time on my hunter this season.
---
I can see why op messed up, some people call season passes "dlc"s. But no you cannot get a preorder because it is a season pass.
---
No harm in adding you, bud :)
---
The Ikelos HC is a 180 which is still extremely viable on console. Very easy to use and even though it‚Äôs year one and you can‚Äôt use mods on it, still packs a punch in crucible.
---
There‚Äôs no better sensation than getting hit with arc energy with the riskrunner
---
Never noticed it, thanks!
---
Lol if you read my replies to other comments you will see I'm definitely trying to be on the positive side. Just a funny little husky joke bud. Looking forward to servers being what they are today and having some fun with everyone. Have a good day one. Love the username and I'm also looking forward to those heat seaker missiles the warlocks get haha

I have no idea, I probably know less on this than you do.

I‚Äôm not sure if you saw but I saw someone either on this or the DestinyTheGame subreddit where their recluse was 69420, and I think that‚Äôs the stopping point
---
Same! Always use chat please
---
I'm going to be at the dentist so I won't be able to play it till later tonight. Ugh!
---
The dreaming city. Scorn are all over the shop and at most events.
---
Genuinely belly laughed out loud. Too familiar.
---
I remember reading/hearing that once Year 3 annual pass wraps up, they'll just immediately transition into another annual pass setof mini-DLCs for Year 4. No big comet expansion. With nextgen around the corner, I imagine they're saving all their resources for D3.
---
You can patrol the tangled shore and they pop up even outside the lost sectors. Go to the top left LZ and look for the scorn public event
---
Dreaming City too, but yes that would require Forsaken.
---
It's getting hot here...
---
Guess I need an Exit Strategy...
---
Spike Grenades + Field Prep/Auto-Loading Holster + Full Court is pretty much the best you can get for PvE.
---
For PvP.. most people don't really use anything but mountaintop or fighting lion in some cases.
---
Aka "You're sushi, bitch!"
---
You people have to let go
---
The drifter seems like a good guy to go drinking with but would not invite him to any formal events.

"UNLIMITED. POWEEEERRRRRR!!!"

Momentum control made Randy's 10 times easier

Or like in TF2 or CSGO where you can buy name tags to put on your weapon, showing the name off to whoever you kill with it.
---
I did it during the first week of Iron Banner and completed it with a full work schedule. It was sooo painful but damn if I wasn't a better Crucible player by the end of it.
---
Aaah yes... Some appreciation for the sparky massacre
---
What guns do you use?
---
Yeah fuck that I hated the quest mainly cuz I hate scouts but I needed that title
---
Thx
---
Thank you :)
---
Hammerhead. You can get that in less than an hour and have fun in Crucible and Gambit to your heart‚Äôs desire. The range on it is stupid
---
I love scouts, but I hate how weak they are currently. They need to be buffed considerably
---
That's just what they told us my guy. Really it's probably a way to give the story any stakes because if guardians were truly immortal nothing they do would be impressive. Shaxx, Osiris, zavala, and ikora wouldn't be impressive because any guardian would be able to do what they do. Ghaul would be right in saying we aren't brave because we don't die, but the deaths of the hundreds of guardians he caused disagrees. Even if we as players know we won't die, in the game, it is very well possible we will and that's what makes us a hero
---
Congratulations! Now you officially don't have the right to die :)
---
I‚Äôm gonna do the opposite now and finally beat death stranding. Made it to chapter 3 and then decided to get back into destiny 2.
---
Destroyer of #DREGS
---
Ive been trying to change it up right but I keep going back to Midnight Coup or Tigerspite for primary... Secondary I dont really have a set Special and Heavy is usually Hammerhead or Prospector.
---
Lol I don't get this mentality. How TF they supposed to launch the season without maintenance ü§£
---
As I'm traveling and can't play today, I'll grab some popcorn and watch for these posts ü§£
---
I get what you are saying.  Or even lowering the price of the items themselves.  If I could buy $20 worth of silver and it would get me 4 to 5 items, instead of 2-3.  Might seem a bit more worth it.  And I get people are on the fence about Eververse.  It doesn't bother me and I'll once in a while get something, if I feel it's cool enough.
---
Seriously. Of all the flack destiny has gotten through 1 and 2, one thing that's maintained to impress since day 1 is the world design and graphics behind it. That department needs more love.
---
R/gifsthatendtoosoon
---
You might have read what somebody assumed bungies plan was. But no its not true. Luke smith said they're going full bore on destiny 2 for a good while. Luke smith wrote a few thousand word essay on everything before shadowkeep launched. You can go read it. Destiny 3 is prob not coming until next gens had a chance to settle.
---
Already have HH
---
Is this an actual armor from the game?
---
This is beautiful. I am inspired to upgrade my crappy room now.
---
HOLY SHIT
---
What i wanna know if why my void guardian cant use his void light and say fuck you crystals well take you home and maybe make somenlamps out of you or save you.
---
Doesn't Tangled Shore require it as well?
---
No, it just removed the entire skill floor of using an SMG.
---
Gambit hates you too.
---
My clan is called the JO Bros...I can't even trust myself with that kind of power
---
Whenever i use RiskRunner. Hit me, i fucking dare you
---
Sooooooooooo good! Best Saint-14 piece I‚Äôve seen yet. Thanks for making it. Fuckin beautiful man!
---
LoL that would be broken... But no it didn't.
---
Good use of Colour also excellent choice of game. Gg
---
Spoopy
---
Nice work!
---
I'm currently at the precision pulse kills and I've managed 71% today with a well rolled blast furnace and momentum control
---
The Tangled shore is part of Forsaken, but I honestly don't know if you can just go there without it.  You might be able to patrol it.  I had a buddy who didn't own Shadowkeep but yet could go to the moon.  So I assume you can just go to the Tangled shore.  But maybe you do need the DLC.
---
Finally, oxygen might have a use.
---
*fun*
---
I tried to get down and boogie with riskrunner, but it‚Äôs just not the same
---
Aww that‚Äôs a shame, amazing stuff man!
---
Apart from the fact that you cant be 980 in Destiny 1, wouldnt your DPS be scaled down like in every Raid? You dont instakill Calus nowadays either
---
In all honesty they all work great depending on your play style, i usually main a hunter and play warlock as my second. As a solo player, i have a very aggressive play style so hunter helps with its agility and fast play style. Warlocks are a fun all around class that helps with carrying others through some key pve gameplay. And if you‚Äôre more of an every day kinda player titans are a great pick for changing things up in both pve and pvp, there really isn‚Äôt any wrong way to play as a titan tbh. From past fps how did you find yourself playing? More reserved? Faster paced? Or a mix?
---
Also make the first upgrade you shoot for the one that gives activities a chance to randomly give out imperials. When it triggers it drops 500.

Just like this one.

The salt will flow if the purple bits are persistent...
---
it could be a quest that opens after you complete the campaign.
---
I burned out in less than two weeks last season.  I‚Äôm done grinding.
---
How about now?
---
what do nades or crimson have to do with it
---
The only reason why I'm buying the season pass is for the headbutt finisher
---
Not that I dont love the recluse. I just like the other options. Ancient gospel etc. Etc.

---
For most bounties, you could also load in a  nightfall solo and not be bothered by randoms. I get your point tho
---
After my attempt yesterday was ended by my power going off and on for no apparent reason, I decided to wake up early today to give it one last shot while I still has oppressive darkness. I've attempted this a few times in the past and always failed the 3rd encounter, but now it's pretty easy, way easier than shattered throne solo flawless imo. I used devourlock because that‚Äôs the easiest but I plan on attempting it on every character once the season of dawn content gets boring. Feel free to ask if you have any questions about what I used or how I did something, but you‚Äôre probably better off watching a guide from someone much better than me. See you all in the dawn
---
I'd probably say warlock to be honest.   Healing rift is clutch
---
Yes
---
You still have 30 mins
---
damn bro
---
I believe that's the final step for that quest (not very familiar with New Light), so you should now be able to any of the campaigns.
---
#It's an ornament
---
All of them work and are good at different things. It depends on how you will play. Try all of them and pick the one you like the most.
---
Ouh, this is kind of late, well at least you will get a bright new year;)
---
U forgot the high contrast 5th one that says saint-XIV is back
---
have you ever seen a AUG
---
Calus's selected on the empyrian cartographer set!
---
I think there‚Äôs a triumph for five resets in one season and the broadsword quest is tied to the triumph.  In any event, if you have five valor resets in a season, it does count toward that step retroactively when you get to it.  Maybe not if you did it when the game first launched in 9/2017 but certainly any recent season since broadsword quest started.
---
Without Eris we wouldn't have known about the Pyramid, among other warnings, so I'm more willing to give her a pass.
---
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.polygon.com/platform/amp/destiny-2-guide-walkthrough/2017/9/5/16257860/class-pick-choose-hunter-warlock-titan-subclass-differences-strengths-weaknesses
---
This is a good, quick fix guideline. Of course, you'll need your own research and experience. I prefer the hunter due to being a support player. I can use the bow to tether multiple targets and give the team extra damage capability while hindering enemy movements and can also vanish to help revive down teamates and stay alive to avoid wipes. It's very individually subjective, though. The game is huge and you'll have plenty of activities to thoroughly try them all for yourself.
---
Agreed. I honestly have no expectations to see him again unless in a flashback or something, and I don't mind it at all. 
---
If they showed a slight possibility of his return at the end of Destiny 2 as something that leads into Destiny 3, I wouldn't be as opposed to that. But I think it would take some phenomenal lore writing to do it well.
---
...titan main?
---
Just a feeling as mediorcore hunter;D
---
This season alone I did:
---
21% Delirium, Exit Strategy, and Hush in Gambit,
---
Wendigo, Edgewise, and Oxygen SR3 in Strikes,
---
Mountaintop, Redrix's, Randy's, Revoker, Recluse, and Not Forgotten in Crucible.
---
Since I already had Breakneck, Loaded Question, and Luna's Howl that means I now have all available Pinnacle and Ritual weapons in the game. It felt pretty damn good, but it was definitely a slog at times.
---
Cayde 7?
---
Oh, I didn't know that armour existed. I never played D1. They could just bring it across, make it an ornament.
---
lol same.  I work til 4 EST.   really excited.   have they said there will be a campaign?
---
i‚Äôd say an hour or two. just my guess
---
That's a cool ass ghost shell
---
Reset
---
3 character slots and 3 classes. Seems like a choice of one would be a non-issue. 
---
That being said, I started as a hunter because I loved the theme and I miss the vertical mobility when I play other classes, but each class has defensive and healing abilities, they each have one-hit-kill maneuvers, they have access to the same weapons and armor.
---
The only real difference seems to be the flavor of the abilities they use and they boil down to typical futuristic archer, fighter, mage archetypes.
---
All I'm trying to say is that each can hold their own against any enemy in the game and since most content has matchmaking, you never really need to find a group (except for Raids, but I'd suggest joining a sherpa group on the Destiny 2 discord so everyone else is at the same experience level as you)
---
Phillips bye matches the screen colours if you are on pc.
---
Fuck cayde
---
Yes I got that one. Though the quest says to reset not to get triumph so I never thought about it. Thank you very much for the info!
---
It's always the 400 iq hunters that bring blade barrage on the pve activities
---
warlocks have the least interesting exotics and the smallest playerbase. Id choose hunter if you like mobility, titan if not.
---
As i like to discuss. Bringing cayde back would not just kill the lore. It would kill every future story with death. Maybe they could explain it through lore. But Bungie wouldnt be taken serious anymore. Because they brought back cayde so they can bring back every other char that died and so on...
---
Apparently I'm in the minority, but I don't believe they had sex.
---
I'm glad I am not the only one who noticed this. During most of the season I get nothing, then this past week I had 3 drop. It cant be a coincidence.
---
I'll be on another game before I get bored enough to grind this tedious nonsense.
---
Yeah because this is more annoying than double dodge arc battery, right? Because hUnTeRs TaKe SkILl
---
Yeee
---
Oh my gosh I remember this guy! Webkinz were my life!
---
Apparently the go down at 4pm gmt, then back up at 6pm.
---
I dropped mine off a bounty about 2 weeks ago. Did they just update it?
---
$$How much silver? $$
---
Looks vex infested
---
Jesus christ. Getting delirium and breakneck was enough gambit for me, I don't think I can force myself to get Hush. Not to mention Not Forgotten, and even Lunas before that. And here I thought doing all exotic hand cannons was hard...
---
Lmao wow dude you could not sound more like a douchebag if you took a f****** class in it
---
Try hard found
---
New season starts today btw, I wouldn't delete the game. Honestly, if you truly had hackers in your game, that's like a 1/10000 chance in this game. It's extremely rare compared to other games
---
Shit I might be able to PASS WITH FLYING COLORS
---
Thanks!
---
thank you very much
---
Oh I get that, I do. But I was just clarifying what I believe OP was talking about. The sun dail itself doesn't ressurect anything, but a by product of it's power could bring someone back to life.
---
I didn't realize it was *only* a thing for Mercury.
---
I really wanna gift my friend some LED backlights but I‚Äôve been to his place and it‚Äôs such a mess I know he‚Äôll never really use them
---
Everyone that wants Cayde back is ignoring the whole reason why Cayde is dead.
---
If they every did bring him back they would need an entirely new VA which would break who the old Cayde was anyway.
---
That‚Äôs why, lore wise, they have in the game that he specifically says not to bring him back at all. He basically gives everyone a DNR order for him.
---
The servers go down at 11:00 A.M est the download will be available at 12:00 P.M. est and the game will be playable at 1:00 P.M. est
---
Thanks for the info!
---
FOR THE PUPPIEEEEEEEEEEEEEES
---
Well done!! I was going to go for my second flawless solo run but decided to work on sleeper catalyst instead. Maybe again this new season.
---
I totally learned my lesson from the Shadowkeep release issues and definitely didn't take off today also only to realise that I didn't learn my lesson from the Shadowkeep issues...
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
I don‚Äôt have any titles try again sweaty
---
But seriously, people are so damn obssessed with the end-reward rather than playing the game for fun and getting a reward as part of that. If you don‚Äôt want to ‚Äúgrind‚Äù for something, just... don‚Äôt. You won‚Äôt die
---
$10 per Season afaik
---
Hydras spawn in the vex milk area I think
---
When i played with grepperud8
---
I might actually go for this one
---
GARY
---
Same...
---
May sound crazy, but I am so ready to have to consider other options in the energy slot after this update. There was basically no scenario in which it wasn't a great - or even the best - option.
---
Here is an idea, maybe don't leave everything until the last day?
---
Hold up hold up, destiny 1 will undergo maintenance?
---
Forsaken adds really much content to the already good amount of content, I‚Äôd recommend buying forsaken if you enjoy the game. Shadowkeep adds a little less content, but is cool nonetheless. I‚Äôd buy forsaken first, and if you still like it and running out of content buy shadowkeep or the current season.
---
Every time (3) I've opened 7+ black amrory bounties (including weekly) at the same time as fast as I could I got a rare bounty. Not once have I otherwise gotten one
---
If you weren't there before Season of Dawn, and you didn't have to traverse that bullshit on foot, I feel there needs to be a month long quest for you to unlock the god damn sparrow use for Mercury.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Just so you can have a taste of the frustration and rage the rest of us have had since Curse of Osiris launched.
---
Kind of a wierd time to jump in, the new season is dropping today so the servers will get rushed once it comes back on. Should clear up after the 1st hour. S h o u l d
---
I'm just gonna have to stick with my *Firmly Planted *Headseeker. yaaaay! you'll see me squatting in the crucible with it one day.... lol
---
Malgus totally did. He has it because he took a grenade to the fase
---
What's NF?  never did a Raid as I tried Leviathan multiple times and there was nobody matchmaking so I consider Raids as non existent activities.
---
I have a job dude i work 5 days a week 10 nd a half hours every day 
---
Sorry that i have a life
---
I think that's what's going on
---
You're still going to get more advertisements for "carries". 
---
Anyways, just my two cents. I've seen this question/idea/proposal made many times, and the answers always circle back to the potential negatives outweighing the potential positives. Maybe there is a perfect way to implement it where it wouldn't get abused too much, I just personally haven't seen it happen in any popular game.
---
Nigga please
---
That notification is all part of the game. I've been on that screen for the last 4 hours. Really fun. Anticipating the ending.
---
The new season will start today, so I think they are updating the server right now and maybe a lot of people are trying to connect to the server.
---
For me it was the Austringer as a new player it seemed very nice with its stats and simple to get but the runes and imperials are so annoying to get
---
I had to kill Hive on Mercury. Took me a solid hour of griding the forest just to get 4 of those fucking things.
---
It's definitely not going to suck lol! But it won't be as idiot proof to use. Instead of just point and spray anywhere, they'll have to point and spray carefully.
---
Nope
---
Volume 1 is a good read, I'd guess the second will be too
---
Good catch, my mistake. 
---
The second part still plays though, you should be able to use the adventures to get those kills without having to mess with that public event - because that one does just suck, it's one of the larger public events, but it's too long really.
---
Did I just hear Rick's voice ?
---
Dammit, I wasn‚Äôt going to chase another title but fucking dammit how do you pass this up?
---
She done fucked up
---
Yeah I have a near perfect one with multikill clip but rolled with firmly planted... if it had just been feeding frenzy... To add insult to injury I made it up to the undying mind‚Äôs summoning and each room before actually dropped an adhortative... with piss poor rolls lol. Oh well so it be
---
Can't wait to slap anti barrier on there, proc desperado and melt barrier mobs
---
Reminds me of the Ikana temple from Majora‚Äôs mask
---
I got 3 exotics today :')
---
I just started playing recently and this is the most exotics that I have got in a day.
---
Needs more helm of Saint-14
---
So does everyone else. Lol. I work almost 70 hours a week. Don‚Äôt blame your poor time management on Bungie.
---
They were down 0-3 and he emoted on him ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, but honestly that arcstrider wasn't much better, he was just spamming R1 when he should've went for a combo on the Sentinel
---
Thanks friend!
---
So is thunder coil? Are you gonna make sense or what?
---
Most people are in the same or worse situation as you. Boohoo.
---
Other people with similar work times or even larger work times got the title. That isn't an excuse.
---
And even if it was, you do realise that playing a game that takes a lot of time to keep up with everything is probably not the best game to play in your circumstances... right?
---
Boo that sucks.
---
Gratz dude. Getting exotics is nice, indeed. Once you get a bunch of all the main exotics you'll then move your sights to getting good god rolls on purple legendaries. IMO getting god rolls makes a huge difference on the weapons.
---
How is it poor time manigment i dont get much time to play every day and i was at the last step and a warlock showed up and nova bombed the last gate lord then legit emoted before i can kill the hydras its a stupid mechanic in public space
---
There
---
Haha yah. We were working on quests so not using ideal weaponry, I just love that specific emote
---
Honest to god, this comment is underrated, I couldn't even fit all the quests and bounties without it being full all the time
---
That, Stompees, Shards of Galinor, and Orpheus rig literally never leave my inventory
---
[https://youtu.be/MjKft91jZ38?t=156](https://youtu.be/MjKft91jZ38?t=156)
---
Maybe that's what it was...I know they always have 3 races you have to genocide, and remembered one was not cabal or vex. One of those adventures seems to have all the races though -- they're all fighting the vex though, so you have to push in and kill the vex before they clear them out.
---
Oh wow, really? trying that card?
---
Ok, work 5 days a week, if not 6, I don't always have time to play on my days off, that is if they are connected. I actually took the time to start and finish dragon quest 11, pokemon sword and shield as well. And still had time to finish this 3 weeks ago.
---
So congrats on being on the same boat as most people.
---
I didn't grind last season because vex invasion was utter garbage
---
I want every bullet of recluse to do 100000 damage. But only my gun. No one else's. Bungie plz fix
---
Warlock boots, now with extra T H I C C
---
+ glows that only usable during the event
---
Didn‚Äôt get it work 70 hour weeks also don‚Äôt get about titles soooo yeah
---
Isn't that just a screenshot?
---
Some of the Barons were just plain goofy honestly, couldn‚Äôt take some of them seriously, especially combined with how easy they went down
---
This is the way.
---
Bungie please
---
Exactly
---
Figures.
---
260, like Randy's.
---
Stop comparing Destiny to Warframe.
---
well getting 1 shot from 1000 miles away every 1 second after respawn was fun right?
---
With the perfect paradox shotgun
---
Sounds oike there raid is our strikes
---
Off work at 6pm so hopefully I‚Äôll get home after all the server crashes are over.
---
You tried bungee support?
---
Because it was one shotting champions and shit. They were OP as fuck. Don't try to say they weren't.
---
oh my god i totally forgot about arbalest ty
---
The game is free. They can do what they want now.
---
That is my dweam setup
---
[this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nnr9-n3CdhI) really breaks down why recluse is the best primary weapon in the game by miles, and why it needs to be nerfed.
---
Both are good reads and the art is pretty good too! Enjoy :)
---
Right when I logged on.got both versions of shadow keep at launch
---
Releasing on guardian records this week the hot new album from Sad Boi Vuvuzela: shaxx on shaxx on shaxx.
---
Currently doing Remembrance and Broadsword at the same time. At this rate, 100 guardian revolver precision finals seems like a joke to me.
---
Little tip for all doing anything with Revolvers/Scout rifles. If you first shot does less than 50 damage, just run away. You‚Äôll four shot if you are precise, but most likely 5 shot which gives you a low survival rate.
---
Wow that's gorgeous
---
I missed Undying by just Randy's and Spear of the Fore, so the feeling of that narrow defeat has me really burning to just crush this new one as quickly as possible so I can finally say I got a title.
---
I didn‚Äôt even realize! Someone just told me about white leveling gear in the collections tab. I‚Äôve been playing since launch and had no idea such a thing existed.
---
Star crossed helm ornament
---
Yo fuck you I don't even watch twitch or whatever Datto is. This is literally the ONLY platform I look at except for my name is byf. Fuck outta here. How can you say wall hacks are worthless, did you get hit in the head? Are you high? 
---
You're the guy that gets domed when you corner bound and you call hacks because it "happened so fast," don't you?
---
I can't tell you how many times I have domed people because of the tracker, with a sniper. The amount of clean-up kills I get with incendiary grenade and pulse grenade and even void spike, because I can see where they decided to crouch to recover is beyond my ability to have counted. 
---
If you think the tracker is useless you play at a novice level with blinders. I bet you get radar tricked don't ya
---
Crucible is the easiest only requires Heroic glory rank! Linear fusion rifle.  Gambit is a shot gun. Vanguard is a side arm.
---
Where do I get from
---
D2 Y1 was the most beautiful time for crucible. People had to actually win their gun fights. Shotguns, snipers, fusion rifles all weren‚Äôt permanent staples for players that never left their hands... Was a more honorable time.
---
Didn't work on Undying, going to push for the title this season, hopefully it's not awful

Sorry man it was an eververse reward a few seasons back. You might be able to get it from nostalgic engrams
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm all for the change, and think I will still use it for certain things, just was funny to finish the grind one day before the nerf.
---
No doubt, it will still be amazing. But it might not be the only option people go for. We'll see:).
---
Yeah... that‚Äôs me looking at the new seasonal armor.. it looks so lovely. Time needs to move fast I want to be home!

I understand you‚Äôre not affiliated with bungie. Just a rant, probably best you removed it anyways.

This post will be updated weekly rather than a new post each week.
---
F okay thanks for the info
---
Played for about a year after launch and just started playing again. Man, Bungie has done a good job filling the game out. I wish it had more meat on its bones at launch but it seems that's not the destiny model. My fav gun acquired was a not-quite-godroll claws of the wolf (missing outlaw) - nothing fancy but man is it fun as shit in crucible, which is almost exclusively what I do. Momentum control fucking RULES.
---
Where the hell is the info for this, isn‚Äôt it from behind a quest at sint released yet?
---
What if everything since curse of Osiris is a simulation
---
It looks pretty cool
---
One that describes him perfectly. All Hail!!
---
More like halo plasma pistol
---
Thank God for Jim!
---
Fuck. That‚Äôs very cruel. So in both cases we definitely need to hit it again? It‚Äôs not logged as completed within that season?
---
Wake up neo the matrix has you
---
I thought it was going to be Crucader but Savior sounds cool too
---
F well thanks for letting me know
---
For the new season. Is this the one that just came out?
---
Same, plus I have mid-terms next week.

Trust the Gambit hand canon. All the exotic hand canons. Also the spare rations from gambit prime

And an og being the midnight coup from the leviathan raid
---
I just started to. I just start messing around, but if you‚Äôre going for looks human is the way to go. In my opinion.
---
I‚Äôm 100% on board for special ammo nerfs.
---
Crucible had way too many things for people to crutch on. Most people don‚Äôt even pull out a primary weapon if they can help it.
---
I‚Äôm all for fast gameplay, but when you can play as a titan w/ a fusion rifle and a 1-shot melee you never loose? That‚Äôs pretty outrageous
---
bruh
---
&gt; People had to actually win their gun fights.          
---
              
---
That‚Äôs a weird way to say ‚Äúsat in the back of the map with MIDA‚Äù
---
Unless you bought specific versions of Shadowkeep (Deluxe and one other one I believe), you have to buy each season separately for 1000 silver, roughly $10
---
So you‚Äôre telling me 150 scouts will no be trash in momentum cuz 180s two tap to the head already, shoot faster, and most people have +5 resilience anyways? I mean, I purposely avoided 150 scouts in that gamemode because they feel kinda scummy and I had other non meta guns I wanted to use, but they couldn‚Äôt have found a different way to deal with that?
---
I feel as though since Cayde died Ikora and the other guy should die as well. If the hunters lose their mentors then the other two classes should as well. At least Cayde actually did stuff instead standing at the tower all day.
---
I thought that too
---
I had exotic emote drop. Something like ‚Äúlet‚Äôs chat‚Äù. Went to check it out via emote tab and it‚Äôs no where to be seen lol
---
My point exactly.
---
IT BURNS
---
Tier 1 is +3 above your current power level (what your level would be if you equip your highest level item for every slot)
---
Tier 2 is +4
---
Tier 3 is +5/6
---
Before you hit the powerful gear cap (currently 960), pinnacle rewards will be +5/6.
---
Peepee frug

Doesn‚Äôt have to be void
---
Are you new here? Solo/panic blade barragers literally turned themselves into a meme
---
\*eating popcorn in the background\*
---
It literally says it right there
---
Yeah it happened to me...
---
How is the new exotic btw?
---
It says "defeat bosses anywhere in the system", so my guess is defeat bosses anywhere in the system to progress it.
---
I believe named enemies count as bosses, like strike bosses and the like.
---
Painfully true. I've noticed a lot of menu lag when I swap between menues and add ornaments/shader to my armor.
---
I was joking obviously lol
---
Yeah I got the ones I really cared about and in truly ironic fashion, I immediately looked at the new seasons ornaments in game and decided I wanted them more/would have used them anyway haha
---
Is there something in my post/this topic that is polarizing? I‚Äôm not sure why people think I‚Äôm upset or why they are so opposed to change. I‚Äôm not crying for it but would it be so bad to have these things available past one season or even just a system to catch things like this?
---
I just think refusal to even ask better of bungie is how we get to things like this season‚Äôs reprised iron banner set. We shouldn‚Äôt crucify them to change the game but it‚Äôs strange how willing the player base seems to just bend over and take it without complaint.
---
I want FWC as ornament. I spent the last day in the crucible with FWC armour on and using FWC weapons as a thing to do but man you really miss the mods on the armour and the weapons are a bit under powered now too. We need ornaments 2 for weapons so it's not just reskinning them but make them look like other weapons. Probably won't happen though because it would remove tactical info in crucible.
---
Symmetry prime, drops from axi s69 needs 420 rare parts
---
It‚Äôs okay, nothing to call home about. Probably gonna be annoying as hell in crucible
---
I'm still on the fence on buying an OLED or QLED TV, though I'm leaning more towards the latter. I've got my PC hooked on my current LCD TV and I'm afraid Windows' taskbar will burn in the OLED screen after extensive hours of PC gaming. Any of you think I'll be better off with a QLED instead?
---
Better than Eriana‚Äôs Vow? I wasn‚Äôt a fan of that one
---
I‚Äôll be honest I liked the forsaken voice actor better
---
Hush your opinion is not wanted, titan noob

Not sure why he was butthurt. I just called Titans cowards.

What is this OP weapon and how do I get it ?

wut the fuck?

Hell of an update üòë
---
Polaris is good before the new changes

Scout rifles have a place now because the mods go on them which doesn‚Äôt apply for exotic scouts unfortunately. No Feelings or Randys could be good

The armor is amazing. I thought it would have been a cash shop item. Instead it's 10 euros for the season pass+grind. While way worse armors are in the shop for 15 euros and you only get 1 armor set (for 1 character) for that price. Doesn't. Make. Any. Sense.
---
Whoever came up with their in-game shop is probably the same guy who chimes in on what servers to get. Oh is it dual core? Lol we don't need DUAL core! This ain't the future Jeff!
---
Haven't been watching, what's the broken stuffs?
---
Well I didnt have this issue on Stadia
---
Yeah I completely derped when I came back I completely forgot about the collections badge. So I saw everything else and thought I could spend the entire weekend getting that done.
---
Servers still down after the update... Good
---
And the only way to utilise Liars handshake is to give up focus choice and exotic armor choice.
---
Yes I am done.
---
But but but but...i can use my izanagi then.
---
Defeat bosses anywhere in the system.
---
Can't play until the weekend
---
What.
---
Imagine you get like 80% of your super because you used your class-ability once.
---
Imagine a Hybrid of a Jotuun and a 260 scoutrifle 
---
Imagine not getting progress for many things because just lol
---
So what you're saying is that Hunters have 2 ways of 1 shot abilities while Warlocks have only 1?
---
You kinda just answered your own question
---
Man you must be fun at parties
---
I am not going to stop giggling about this.  When ever I see it I am going to say in a baby talk voice, "Awww did Hunter leave a boom-boom?!"
---
thanks
---
Change is much much better for hunter's. If you play PvP then you should be a mobility hunter and as such your dodge is cheaper. It's easier to slot a mobility mod than paragon mod also.
---
I got one and played for a few hours no issues?
---
For next season so planet quest they don‚Äôt Change
---
I literally do no use my Slova bomb unless it‚Äôs to cancel a super, there‚Äôs three+ enemies grouped up perfectly, or if I‚Äôm trying to stop a power-play in IB.
---
Amen.
---
Pair this up with double dodge and void battery and PvP is gonna be aids
---
[removed]
---
sadly we cant get modern saint-14s set(the one with the spikes) i would put that on my titan... but eh at least i get to rock another variation of the set... when i hit rank 97
---
Me tho tbh
---
I'll look into it
---
Interesting idea, I'd give it a go
---
and the pre-infinite forest saint-14 set will be fully unlocked when you hit rank 97
---
Bungie has disabled the dynamo mod due to this issue.
---
 Np. I donno how much would be the price difference but u can also consider the Kingston HyperX Fury or Corsair Vengeance rams.
---
Yeah but it still shows up on steam as bundled with undying, that's the part op was asking about.
---
Hope that gets shutdown real soon.
---
Yea. Ones a good high RoF. Ones a bad high RoF. I even with x5 swash, recluse still does better. It also has an element. Making it all around better. Pair that with nigh instant reloads, and nothing stands.  Theres no legitimate argument for exit here.
---
Wanna 1v1?
---
Whats the timer and blast radius like, does it drop a flat mine or an obviously large bomb?
---
If you're on ps4 I can bang some out for you
---
Baby jotun
---
My Pc is an i5 650 with 8GB DDR3 and a 1050ti. Also a 650W power supply. Destiny runs mid settings (with Discord open) at 100 fps.
---
You are kidding me right?
---
I bet you got some salt from that
---
I think those are just like 20$ more what‚Äôs the difference when it comes to different brand rams
---
Someone already beat you to this one lol
---
It acts a lot like the fallen bombs that pop up and slow you (just with an explosion instead of a slow). Timer is just a little bit quicker than those, too
---
I checked again, I jus hadn‚Äôt updated the game. I‚Äôll have to see how it is once the update‚Äôs downloaded
---
Auto Rifle/AR. Heh
---
That sounds awesome, thanks!
---
I got it from a strike. Weird that it drops from at least 2 different activities.
---
Zhalo Supercell is basically riskrunner but not on steroids. Red death is crimson but stronger. I also want P&amp;T and mythoclast back. We basically have khvostov. No . They are not gonna bring back hawkmoon or anything luck in the chamber related because they don‚Äôt want rng to be the reason you can win in crucible. Devrim stole NLB from our vaults. Bolt-Caster  is black talon, Raze-Lighter is basically any sword and Dark Drinker still needs to come back. Dragon‚Äôs breath no no i don‚Äôt want it here. They want to keep gally legendary, which is why we‚Äôll never see it again. They also do not want regenerating weapons again, so icebreaker and the shotgun(forgot name) are also off the table
---
So that was the rundown of weapons you can expect in D2, i‚Äôll say them again if you were to lazy:
---
Dragon‚Äôs Breath
---
No Land Beyond (Redundant because arbalest)
---
Zhalo Supercell (Redundant because Riskrunner)
---
Patience and Time
---
Vex Mythoclast
---
Necrochasm
---
Touch Of Malice
---
Dark-Drinker
---
The sniper that nobody used but looked really cool
---
Lost sectors
---
No problem - it's definitely fun to use
---
I assembled many PCs with the rams I mentioned and never really had problems with them. Personally I don't know much about G. Skill rams so it's more of a habit and preference from past experiences.
---
Thanks for the info! Hope that gets nerfed ASAP.
---
It‚Äôs just a joke bruh
---
I can‚Äôt wait to play destiny with that many frames any game really I‚Äôve always been a console player I‚Äôm excited. Also excited at the fact I won‚Äôt need to use a controller with such a low sens
---
Followed by 2 months of nothing dropping outside of bugging Xur
---
okay, this is epic!
---
I was getting servers down still about an hour ago but the game needed updating. Even with the auto update on the game didn't update. I had to manually assign the game to update, it's about a 5gb download and will put the game size (at least on XB1) to 100.8 gb or so.

---
Got it firm first pvp match today :)
---
It is designed so that the average player can just barely complete it.
---
Doing just 2 levels a day guarantees that you‚Äôll finish it while having loads of time to spare
---
Hype. Can't wait to get back home and play.
---
It's an estimate, but I wish you good luck for your frames. And by being a console player as well, Crucible is SOOO much easier on pc in terms of controls. Sadly, the enemy are sweatier, but now, so you can be too!
---
Don‚Äôt you need to get progress with the catalyst and once that‚Äôs done you‚Äôll get the bonus for it and the triumph
---
Np. Good luck!
---
No land beyond? :D
---
I hardly play hunters, so I appreciate the feedback.
---
I got everything, and only play in the weekends, didnt really grind, just played. So in my opinion it is pretty easy to achieve rank 100
---
I play all classes I main hunter but love my pub stomping titan warlocks a bit meh but they all have disadvantages you just gotta work round yours
---
Woohoo!
---
Well if the exotics pre rolled when you pick up the engram anyways then it can still be a dupe
---
Nope, I never do bounties unless I want something from eververse that week (bright dust). I play for 1-2 hours a weekday because I have wrestling practice right after school. I was tier 110 at the end of the season without any worries or trying to level up the season pass.
---
I got to 254 and i work 40 hours a week... my dad got from 75 to 100 in 3 days using 2 of his days off to get there so no its not hard to get to 100, casually playing should get you there in 3 weeks if you know what you are doing.
---
I'm also having this issue. It says I don't have the season pass and therefore don't have the +1 additions to light that would unlock through playing.
---
Oh, ok thanks.
---
Bungie is trolling us PvPers at this point
---
its ok. kills weak enemies in a maybe 4-5 meter radius. leaves a knight on 1/2-1/3 of their health. if it doesnt kill the enemy then they get pushed pretty far away
---
I mean now we don't even have a strong super to balance lack of nuetral
---
Damn son, charge your phone. Nice roll though
---
or you can go into the ahattered throne in the thrall room. i got 8 catalysts done in there.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs no worries. The Destiny lore is poorly explained and even more poorly understood unless you literally are watching it every expansion since everything gets shifted just with one entry sometimes. One thing is that the Hive changing morphs is something they‚Äôve been able to do since before they even met the worm gods (like Savathun wanting to be a mother). But that also may also be a lie since Savathun says everything Oryx said is a lie.
---
Hoping everything else is going to be really awesome this season.
---
Didn‚Äôt look like it did burn damage to me, that‚Äôs a pretty rare status anyway.
---
Get a job
---
Tell me about it. I've got 450+ hours as a new light starter and don't even consider that a lot. Mind you I did also get over 200 levels on the pass so maybe it was.
---
She'll be fine, but I should mention I don9actually have this roll, I was just looking through potential rolls on the companion app
---
You know it won‚Äôt be
---
The eververse store is like the best its been right now though. Its a free to play game now, they have to get money somehow. It cant just all be free or it would turn into gta shark cards
---
The timing could not have been better
---
In conclusion. Turtle.
---
Same, please give them back.   
---
Will they still work on armor 1.0? If so, nevermind.
---
I don‚Äôt see anything special about this gun.
---
Probably because it‚Äôs orange
---
Oh hell yes!
---
Dang, that's super handy.
---
Fair enough, good luck in getting it then.
---
Just used it for 5 matches myself and god damn it is fun, the rate of fire is unreal.
---
Cayde-7!
---
Really nifty, thx.
---
I have hope. I did happen to get 2 exotic drops in my 1st 2 games of the day.
---
Unpopular opinion: riskrunner is better 
---
Bring on the downvotes
---
On a very basic level, they are chasing that dopamine rush of achievement, even if it's just the slightest, imperceptible on a conscious level, hit from making progress towards the goal (Savior title in this case). 
---
Human psychology is a funny thing.  We all have our hamster wheels.
---
That's not the point.   I rolled in with matchmaking and no one had EV on or the bow.... no one seemed to know about the rally flag so no one had super it wasn't hard but it took longer to run that re-skinned menagerie than it should of.  The f'king arena shouldn't have been needed to unlock the artifact.  
---
I'm just bitter over this dud of a season already.  I hate being knocked back down in light and having to Re-f'king grind back to where I already was.  I hate content going away.... basically just really starting to hate this game.
---
You shouldn't. Ace is pretty easy.
---
I got the new titan chest armour but that‚Äôs just even less reason to play
---
I'll get ornaments when I can turn ANY piece of armor into an ornament. Until then, meh.  
---
\*stares longingly at old 1.0 armor\*
---
Imagine letting Warlocks be a viable class
---
This post was made by Bungie hang
---
I could do that for you. Just toss me you address !
---
Oh sorry I forgot about the 40 year olds that love in studio apartments with their family because they are bums that still play video games
---
Lol that‚Äôll be the real test! Just gonna wait for the new meta to settle so o can decide what character to use
---
Not a bug. Read the patch notes.
---
HOLY SHIT ITS LORD SHAXX
---
No, my buddy told me over headset to shoot my shot towards the rocks leading from A to C and I trusted him.
---
Me waiting until I get paid to buy shadowkeep deluxe
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say that based on this video alone. It killed a group of thrall, that hardly speaks to its damage capability. I want to see what it does to red bars and up before deciding how useful it is. If it can‚Äôt at least kill red bars I‚Äôd actually say it‚Äôs fairly weak.
---
To my knowledge you can but only for the non random rolled one
---
‚ÄúTHIS IS AMAZING!‚Äù
---
Help yourself dude. Memes are made to be shared.
---
Not all the content is free.  Elements are free to play, sure.   Eververse was prob best for players several seasons ago when we had new cosmetics in engrams (completely free) and only a few items which were silver only.
---
It depends I guess. For someone who just started I will never be able to finsih old stuff and farm new exotics. I think. Unless I get into a clan that will push me throw things easy. I didnt even finish all the moon stuff and havent gotten all the moon weapons and now I have to grind for Dawn(and I played a lot in the last 2 months). In my opinion season has to be longer, than 3 months. But that would be shit for people who already have everything.
---
that would neuter it in pve though, sometimes you gotta be a bit more nuanced with balancing.
---

Honestly tho, does this matter? I mean Mercury is small as hell, which is the reason we couldn't use sparrows there in the first place. This is like getting in a pool with a boat. Like yay.... We can travel across this small ass area faster now yaaayyy.....
---
You usually have to grind for good weapons with good rolls. Especially exotics.
---
You have my condolences
---
80% of the store is free, last season was 50%. Like I said, its free to play now, it wasnt a few seasons ago.
