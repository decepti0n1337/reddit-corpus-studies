Transmat firing!!
---
---
---
I like trains
---
Seems pointless given how no one seems to use Hush.
---
With that reaction time? Ha
---
And another 100 hours till you‚Äôre 749 then about 1000 hours till you are 750 cause you can‚Äôt get that fucking helmet.
---
It‚Äôs the only gun I literally hate on this game !
---
Gambit bad
---
Thank you they also have a generalist ghost shell the starter one for destiny 1 and the Sundance shell (cayde-6‚Äôs ghost shell)
---
My biggest wish is for a barebones version of quickplay or comp, because I think supers just ruin PVP entirely.
---
For real most times it seems if they invade first and kill a couple of us and my team loses about 20 motes they just give the hell up...
---
Yes but bad rng may mean people who can‚Äôt grind 24/7 will never get the gun which is unfair. Raid exotic drop rates need to have a buff or a quest to be more accessible
---
Loved it even more in PvP, that one fateful weekend.
---
I was in a prime match. 
---

---
3 players on my team were botting, running around and shooting air and jumping. 
---
Other team was 4 blueberries. 
---
I managed to get motes 100-0 alone, by invading and wiping them. 
---
I couldn't manage to get the primeval damaged enough because they'd keep invading and killing the AFKs.... 
---
I had to wait until time ran out and they won by having more damage on their primeval...
---
I feel you..for me its the boots.
---
Yes. Yes, it is.
---
This is like when I did Taken Blight on Io and had a team of 3 people run around killing the grunts while they clearly see me shooting the blight in the sky....and yes this was done while I was grinding Heroic Events &amp; Patrols for the armor sets so can imagine how badly that sucked.
---
At least we ain‚Äôt got ornaments no more. Never hit max in d1 because of those fucking things
---
This guy gets it.  Whenever my team gets invaded I look for the person carrying the most motes cause they're usually the one being targeted and sometimes manage to get the invader before they get to them.  Unless y'know that guy is by the damn bank with 2-3 blockers up trying to kill them.
---
Good for you nerd.
---
How?
---
Thank you for the response.
---
Thank you for responding, I just started playing about a month and a half ago so I have been working on the vault triumph. I think I might just be able to get it though.
---
He doesn't visit until Friday reset
---
Oh ok thanks
---
Lol that's gonna be me too that's why I'm not in a clan on PS4.
---
Even in d1 it was still the boots for me, even now my d1 hunter has all 400 gear but 396 boots.
---
Wha-
---
Make all three
---
Damn you I was gonna set him on a wild goose chase lol
---
Yeah but hey, were getting somewhere
---
Bonus if they stand back and wait for you to kill the mobs then steal your motes...but don't touch the motes you deliberately leave for them to pick up.
---
Gambit makes me want to commit arson.
---
Just remember not to get stressed because u have to reach legend in glory 3 times
---
Is it the lesser of two evils?
---
This is how you buff a warlock. You take two and fuse them together.
---
Why do you think? I felt it paced the game and gave other guns an opportunity to have a chance
---
Oh yeah you‚Äôll get it eventually
---
Hunters are the most underpowered change my mind
---
You poor poor bastard.
---
You can get both seeds from Kalli. Clan leader did that for his Titan.
---
PC
---
Welcome to the dark side :)
---
Grabbing the heavy ammo while you're still in the mote collecting phase instead of using it for Invasions.
---
ive never not had other people join me.
---
Gambit was the worst part IMO! I found 3 others seems we lost on purpose lol.  I was invading and emoting my ass off, some of them would emote with me lol
---
Are you fucking kidding me!?! Really!?! Dude GODDAMNIT!!!!!
---
That‚Äôs how it is in literally every game though. That‚Äôs why the call it counter sniping. That or force the sniper in to a close range engagement.
---
Also no one is telling you that you can‚Äôt run that fun gun. You May be putting yourself at a disadvantage but at least you‚Äôre having fun. No one said that the fun guns are good.
---
yeah thats a linear fusion not a snipe. youve clearly never tried to snipe while getting pulse rifled if you think snipings that easy lmao
---
You are getting downvotes, but I can confidently say that, in all the games I‚Äôve played, truth has rarely been a problem for me.
---
Knowing how aggressively it tracks, I‚Äôve been able to get it to hit things all the time, instead of me.
---
Even a single add can cause the Truth to miss.
---
It honestly isn‚Äôt that bad. Jhotunn annoys the hell outta me, but I‚Äôve gotten better at timing my dodging and sidestep as well.
---
I mostly just have a problem with teammates in this game mode. Seems like the majority of people I see complaining about Gambit are not actually good at Gambit. It‚Äôs pretty consistent too, shit teams always try to bank max motes each time (instead of 5-10 pending the situation) and more often than not, when an invader is present, they flee instead of challenging the guy. I can‚Äôt tell you have many times I‚Äôve just went behind a cliff and jumped, causing the Truth Rocket to simply skirt the top of the cave and explode prior to hitting me, then destroyed the invader.
---
Hell, a particularly good player should be at the invader spawn before they even have to chance to look for you, shotgunning them in the face.
---
Maybe I just really get Gambit, and it is the mode for me, but I honestly can‚Äôt fathom how some people think they way they do about Gambit.
---
Sorry for the rant, just wanted to get that out there. Upvoted, because I agree with you.
---
There is a reason why WIN a match with full notorious gear, is the last triumph I need.
---
Ah ok! Last I had read it was happening in September but even better now
---
A tracking dragons breath from d1 with special ammo
---
Thanks üôèüèº this is super helpful
---
I started as a warlock in D1 but after a few months I switched to Titan. Best thing ever
---
I wonder why there aren't that many good rage complications of D2. There are some but not as many as one would think.
---
I'm 90 percent sure I'm right because I got my broadsword in like season 5 and I for sure didn't get 5 resets within one season
---
That‚Äôs what he meant I think
---
First week of September. Check Bungie.net for what's coming in Patch 2.5.2.2, as well as it's drop date.
---
So back playing this game running through the story, quests, etc... And I'm starting to pick up decent spec'd gear.  I'm curious as to whether using the Legendary and Exotics for their traits ( \*apologies if it's not the correct term for D2 as I've been playing TDivision2 mostly and still recovering from Post-Anthem Syndrome. ) is most important compared to combining the most powerful gear pieces ? Only in reference to the point of the game I'm at which is just finishing the Red War Missions off of the Farm and finally achieving my third subclass.   
---
I'm starting to feel like the game is finally going to get hard, having just unlocked the Strikes, and I want to start aiming towards some traits I've started to enjoy. Here's a few weapon loadouts I've enjoyed:
---
Hand Cannon - love this thing...Would love a faster reloading one and ADS  
---
Scout Rifle - Something with higher Mag Capacity and fast reload.   
---
\*\*At first I was only running with weapons with bullets and didn't initially enjoy the pulse weapons and/or understand the ones with the Fire Symbols \_  
---
Thanks in advance
---
Thank you :)
---
sorry was typing it up after the video uploaded.
---
Ahh, you mean the Bitch Cannon yes
---
You're welcome!
---
Make sure to let her know that it's spelled warlock
---
What dance emote is that?
---
Lmao my bad
---
LoL, the struggles!
---
*Sad punchy noises*
---
I'll forever hear this now lol
---
Yes this is correct
---
Any time man!
---
What platform my man
---
Fuck! Xbox.
---
Yeah for sure!  Ive never had the other ones just DS
---
*laughs in superiors blade barrage*
---
They don‚Äôt bring them all back for the simple fact that raze lighter is a default heavy attack for a lot of swords and bolt caster is back via Black Talon. Though, yes, some version of dark drinker needs to happen
---
I dodge it okay most of the time but get killed by the splash damage off the wall behind me or something an insane amount of times
---
Eh, at least I have *dignity*
---
Wow, you are truly a pathetic mess. Poor guy ‚òπ can't say it surprises me though, most of the people on this sub are messed up.
---
I gave up on GETTING motes but find it easier to help the blueberries stay alive with them
---
Daw on PS4. We are mortal enemies now. 
---
I kid. I kid. 
---
Hope you find some companions. They‚Äôre out there
---
All I know is I got my 10 gambit matches for my blue robes and unless I need it for purple I ain't playing gambit until October 1st.
---
Lol, thanks man :)
---
IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER!!!
---
I was made fun of by a lot of people who saw me rocking DD. 
---
And then Aksis happened. Who‚Äôs the smart guy NOW???
---
It was glorious.
---
Honestly I would use your current character and just help them level by doing strikes and crucible. Maybe do patrols on the planets to get a bank of resources for them as well. You‚Äôll need them anyway at some point so why not do that?
---
Just my opinion but do what you‚Äôll have more fun with.
---
Seriously though, I‚Äôve made friends through the game. It‚Äôs a good thing.
---
I started as warlock but damn code of the rocket is actually really fun...
---
Me titan me punch
---
So have I, that‚Äôs what sucks the most, I‚Äôve met some cool people, and known them for literally years, but they just don‚Äôt play anymore, feels bad man
---
What's the latest on the Sunshot catalyst? Is it still impossible to get since Factions are gone? Sunshot is my favourite weapon in the game and I've been wanting the catalyst for EVER.
---
I‚Äôm the opposite I‚Äôm moving to ps4 from pc so I can play with my friend
---
You can reacquire up to the blue armor from your collections. The legendary tier has random perks though, so you cant get those from your collections
---
What is this TF2
---
Ohhh yeah with your shoulder charge üòÇ
---
Haven‚Äôt completed yet been busy at work but you won‚Äôt hear me complain. Should have been lower to begin with. Not question of skill but time. Also them mode itself loses its luster when the grind is like that.
---
That‚Äôs 3 hours too much. Especially for someone who has nothing to gain from Gambit, which is typically always a one-sided match if you don‚Äôt communicate with your team. And you need to multiply that number by 3 since you‚Äôre doing it on multiple characters.
---
I know right?
---
Tbh I think the bottom tree striker is the only broken one. Top tree isn‚Äôt any better than the rest of the supers.
---
Danse macabre?
---
Blade barrage...
---
Is forsaken new to you?
---
Warlocks look like grandmother's to me, they wear oven mitts as gauntlets. "master race" LUL.
---
Feel free to downvote but honestly, you might have fun but being insta killed after you enter the frame isnt fun for anyone and honestly you should go do this stuff in comp instead of quickplay.
---
i did it on warlock so when the witches spawn i could just drop a healing rift and face tank most of the shots while killing adds and doing damage. not sure how you'd do it with the other classes but warlock makes life easier. especially with luna well for voregeth damage phase. once all the adds on the left and bottom of the map are gone with about half on the right killed from the safe spot, its just cleaning up and collecting orbs. if you have the taken mod that refreshes class ability on taken elite kill, it makes life even easier since you can just drop a luna rift and melt the witches, move on to the next and repeat.
---
This is the only thing keeping me from Dredgen
---
It did
---
I'm getting the Most t-shirt
---
i mean even now hunters dont really have that much in terms of good supers. mainly got tether which is tether. which is neither good nor bad its tether. mid tree arc strider which is still bad seeing its main gimmick and upside is also its huge downsides that cripples the super. and golden gun which is insanely good, in the right hands, if youre bad or flick shoot like me, its pretty useless.
---
Very cool kanye
---
So glad I did the last hundred kills on my last character last night   :(   Is a good change though, events feel bad when you need to resort to boss farms to complete objectives.
---
At least we have pizza.... wait.... PINEAPPLE AND BANANA WTF IS THIS MADNESS?!
---
As TheJez once said in his "destiny 2 campaign in a nutshell" Video. Warlock (Actual Master race.
---
I'm pretty sure this was posted here before.
---
Well thanks bungie...already completed all 3 sets. oh well...
---
Well sure thing you can have your opinion just know the facts about the current status of pvp before you go and suggest an entire revert of a change to a company which had a team of people decide that the change of special weapons in pvp was for the greater good of the game. I agree that the game is getting a bit stale due to the pvp weapons meta because obviously there are guns objectively better than others e.g recluse compared to other 900rpm smgs BECAUSE it is a pinnacle weapon you need to earn. But if you think removing special ammo from pvp is going to fix that you're either not aware of the original year one meta which literally had no weapon diversity by the way (the old fashioned, dire promise. etc) before the special weapon change or you're just stupid. Oh yeah and I LOVE talking trash behind a screen especially about people hate stalking me on reddit :).
---
D2 pc convert here. I have heard this many times but on paper I cant tell the difference. What is different between black talon and bolt caster other than element? Also razelighter and basically any other sword, but that question pisses people off
---
I want to be put out of this misery
---
They‚Äôre starting to ban people now (and I‚Äôve seen it be done). They updated their ban policy regarding the AFK systems. Just make sure you‚Äôre reporting these peasants. 
---
*Obviously none of these systems will be immediate...so I do agree Bungie should implement a better in-game AFK prevention system (other than the current 1m idle).*
---
I am just excited to play both on the same character.
---
Being able to play pc at my desk and Xbox in bed and still make progress is so exciting to me
---
Sunshot is my favorite hand cannon, though I end up using Crimson more often due to gear setups.  It‚Äôs crazy fun when you get something like this going.
---
No one is arguing. If I was butthurt I‚Äôd make a meme talking bad about another class. Nice try though.
---
She‚Äôs still Bae-da 1 tho
---
Cheeky grenade launcher and the right timing and ya sorted
---
every class has an op build that outshines the rest. thats it really.
---
It really wasn‚Äôt that bad with the engineer cheese and running it. I finished the mini bosses before the 1500 orbs. The ‚ÄúPlay 10 games of XXX‚Äù especially strikes is way worse IMO
---
Titans literally have Shoulder charge which is just a shotgun built into your kit, not to mention Warlocks can empowering rift to make all sniper shots one shot regardless of head or body.
---
Hunters get... to reload on dodge. Oh, and melee abilities that don‚Äôt even kill on precision hits.
---
Titans have stupid health and Warlocks get stupid health regen. Meanwhile hunters... run really fast. Cool. We‚Äôre so op dude.
---
Also disregard for your own life.
---
In that case, 
---
Titans all supers are good
---
Has shoulder charge
---
Has OEM
---
A big wall and a small one that reloads for them
---
Warlocks 
---
All supers are good
---
Has a healing rift and an empowering rift
---
Can charge grenades to 1 shot people
---
They have devour 
---
Hunters
---
Solar and void supers are good, arc is meh
---
Dodge can reload a weapon once per use
---
Can go invisible (not completely)
---
Good jumps
---
These are just 4 things that came to mind but are good topics of conversation
---
Lol I was always the one guy left collecting chests by myself
---
easily lol. find new people on pc. that is what i did
---
Fml dude I‚Äôve been there. Sucks.
---
You are NOT faster than a speeding bullet nor more powerful than a locomotive.
---
Superman no more
---
...isn‚Äôt that bad.
---
You can do that with the warmind exotic sword though.
---
It‚Äôs name slipped my mind though
---
Just as a reminder
---
1. Hunters are the only class without a one shot melee 
---
2. Titan and Warlock supers give an over shield, heightened mobility, and can kill you TWICE if you spawn in a bad spot
---
3. The hunter's ability doesn't even make you immune to damage even though it's a DODGE
---
4. Bungie has acknowledged that crucible is in a bad place and y'all are about to get nerfed into the ground so don't @ me
---
I feel like auto fill should have a separate que, like if you want to fill into a match you can choose to, or choose not to.
---
Cause yeah, it fucking sucks.
---
Hey thanks for being the toxic dick in the community
---
Too little too late. I‚Äôm 140 in... ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
636 atm, only got it a few days ago from the nightfall, got masterworked handling on it too
---
Oh my god...
---
[removed]
---
To be fair a good golden gun, arc staff, or spectral blades can kill people twice.
---
Seriously, if the sparrow was cooler I would consider it more but nah
---
See I main titan because I only have 100 hours and have been too lazy to level up my others and titan is really fun. In PvP I don‚Äôt go for the LoW or OEM because I like other loadouts. (I have a really good calus mini and decent austringer.) calus mini tool can be devastating If used right. I‚Äôve discovered this. But I do use skullfort in PvP. Because shoulder charging is amazing and unlimited shoulder charging is great.
---
Bungie is doing a hotfix next week and the dates will be extended I believe for the whole season of opulence but not SoH. So all triumphs should be extended. 
---
https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48049
---
Maybe but they don't last nearly as long as storm trance or hammers
---
Ye. Id live an insta summon shell but you kno. Im a common gaymer so oof.
---
YEEEEHEEEHEEEHEEEHEEAAAHH!! TONIGHT!
---
Yeah man I feel you I've been in that clan since the game launched since I got invited and noticed none of them really play anymore. All the clan xp the clan was getting was cause of the time I was putting into the game which is sad tbh lol.
---
Got to the point where it was hard to get extra powerful engrams from certain points and as a solo player it shouldn't really matter but that extra help goes a long way.
---
Kk, so he your info(blizz is for invite and discord tag if you have discord) and I should be able to help you get something rolling tomorrow after I get off work(between 7:30 pm and 8pm Mountain time)
---
It's Brutananadilewski!
---
[for reference](https://youtu.be/BpFxajJNYdE)
---
i love this community
---
Sounds like somebody wants to be raaaaaaped again
---
That‚Äôs across the 5 days this week. Iike an hour max
---
Idk though, half the time people just be running away from supers anyway, blocking just makes this more of a problem cuz the few that might try to engage you otherwise wouldn‚Äôt (except for a couple retards).
---
Probably should've prefaced with I play on Xbox, if you're on PC.
---
Yeah just pick it up from shaxxy poo
---
I believe you misspelled broken
---
What‚Äôs the quest called ?
---
Meanwhile peeps using prom lens
---
Shiiiiii
---
Ya, I'm on pc
---
üêªüëçüõåüõå  Good Game.
---
Even not having them saved I was able to do 25-30 in a day. I was pretty surprised to realize how many bounties are available amongst gambit, crucible, vanguard, planet bounties, tribute hall, and black armory.
---
it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôd kill them anyways... they might as well run
---
you have my respect as not only the hardest class to master but also as the most coolest guy to ever cool.
---
Yeah I agree. I personally regret doing it so early. I was one of the first few people I saw with the armor but now I can‚Äôt stand playing the EAZ because I spent like 5 hours or something stupid playing it constantly to get the 100 mini bosses done and I have no desire to do the grind for another character.
---
One of my runs for 200k we killed Xol a bit after the 15 min mark. Still should of gotten the points with that kill to make it, but the score kept going down even in his death animation... and D2 didn't give us the points... I quit nightfall that day.
---
I‚Äôve been done for a week &gt;.&lt;
---
I‚Äôm a PS4 solo player. Be nice to have people to play with even though I only play for an hour here and there. Played both destiny 1 and 2 but never done a strike or raid. Usually do the campaign get bored and move on. Mainly down to being solo
---
Not sure why everyone does this farm, it felt faster and way less boring to just run EAZ normally. When I found a fireteam we just rolled together and got around 7-9 every run and just requeued directly into another EAZ after minibosses we‚Äôre done and got it done pretty fast.
---
Yeah no way I can do it on the other characters. If they could let you finish as long as you had the armor pieces that would be nice. Like I know they gave us a month but I play other stuff, I work and I got college starting again like in 3 days.
---
You just gatta sidestep lol xd
---
I joined the no life club to get my 3 guardians their armor too lol but this QoL change is really good for those who spaced it out knowing they had a month to complete it.
---
BECAUSEOFTEXAAAAAAASSSS!!!!
---
You should get a package in your inventory you have to open to get them. Hope this helps.
---
Okay yea i didn't know they were in a package , thanks so much
---
Finished it all today
---
Don't worry about it, glad to hear you figured it out.
---
So now that I‚Äôm almost done with the mini bosses, my efforts at for nil?
---
:)
---
By the owner of shirt too if I remembering correctly!
---
i don‚Äôt know mate, some people will do anything for a bit of that good good karma
---
The text chat in game is very used, even to talk with blueberries, i use text chat a lot  with teammate too. Voice isn't used because NAT problems i think, many players can't hear others.
---
talking a lot off shit for someone on BEYBLADE RANGE
---
With this change 150 miniboss kills becomes quite doable though! That's only 1.5 times a single run in the current system
---
You expect people to be out there using the white assault rifle you first get in the game lol?
---
Probably 2 thirds of the total weapons in game aren‚Äôt even legendary or exotic so you can count those out straight away.
---
On xbox yes I can
---
None of those are perks on supremacy. Its the mod on the sniper and the enhanced perk on the helmet.
---
Targeting adjuster is only 5 aim assist anyway
---
I don't believe that will work. The cross save feature is to allow more people freedom to try a different system, not pick and choose for each event.
---
It's just the answer you needed, dude.
---
Shotguns don't need to be nerfed, we just need better map design. It doesn't take a lot of effort for a hunter to sidestep, a warlock to blink in front of you and a titan to shoulder charge behind a pillar. The maps are shittily made and those that aren't close quarters maps just aren't fun to play on regardless of whatever you use
---
Do you like supremecy over revoker? I have a poop rolled one so maybe that‚Äôs why I like revoker better. Plus I have targeting adjuster on it, with enhanced sniper, enhanced flinch on my gear.
---
Fuck why didn‚Äôt I think of that. Hunters void grenades suuuuuuuuuck
---
You could be out of space, but if the icon is dark and it doesn‚Äôt give you an option to reobtain it, it‚Äôs means you either didn‚Äôt get it, or the game‚Äôs glitched.
---
my Supremacy has Outlaw &amp; Rapid Hit. I just love the whole Weapon in General because it still feels snappy and light, i just need those 6 Bullets. Revoker feels too heavy to me , id always choose quickdraw over Snapshot
---
Talks about how shotguns need to be nerfed &gt; uses the Recluse
---
[quote]If you have Destiny 2 on Battle.net then you can use the Cross Save feature for the game on Battle.net on August 21st, 2019.
---
Destiny 2 will not be moving over to Steam until October 1st, 2019. This is when Destiny 2 will become free to play with New Light. The Shadowkeep expansion will also release on Steam at this time.[/quote]
---
From Bungie.net
---
As invader main I usually let others get them.
---
I was originally going  to make this post about the sheer amount of shotguns I see in the crucible being used as primary weapons, because it's literally about 3/6 to 4/6 people per team using only shotguns. Today I was using Age Old Bond, a nice raid auto, and I was having fun and doing pretty well with it. I use a scout as my main weapon and get on average a 2.5 KD and a 3.0+ KDA every game, despite everyone claiming "scouts suck in this meta." Sidearms are my favorite backup weapon, I'm just using Recluse because my build is centered around Nezarac's Sin (void weapons). There are so many fun options that you can wreck with, but people listen to the meta too much. They think if a weapon has a 0.5s TTK (sidearm) it's never going to compete with a one hit kill shotgun, but that's just not true in most situations. I think people just listen to too many YouTubers on what is/isn't meta.
---
Considering (most) People like this, feel free to watch my Last Dualtage with my Friend! He plays on PC, i play on XB1 https://youtu.be/jociqHKAzZw
---
Oh yeah it's for sure an improvement. Too bad most people have either done a set and cbf doing the rest or have done all of them already and now hate themselves.
---
Congrats man! I managed to get recluse/revoker this season, but I can‚Äôt for the life of me get my 100 precision hand cannon kills done for Luna‚Äôs, I get two headshots and then always hit the body for the final blow lmao.
---
Any hand cannon recommendation for it?
---
4 stack. even before the afk plague, 4 stacking was always the best way to play especially in prime with dedicated roles.
---
That isn't the only glitch in the collections, unfortunately. One of the best sidearms in the game is NOT a randomly-rolled gun. However the **Death By Scorn** is unable to be retrieved from collections for that exact reason. This means that if you deleted it, you need to get a random drop in order to use it.
---
Most of my friends haven‚Äôt made swap to PC like I have, and most of my lfg groups have ended with toxic people where they get mad at me for not having meta gear
---
No matter how bad the game was, infinite warfare had a good addition. Gesture warfare. Where you use emotes in order to produce different effects onti the enemies. Unfortunately adding this onto destiny would be a bit difficult
---
How does it work? I just started on PC last night. Willing to participate for phree st00f.
---
Too late :(
---
Fine-Addition-To-My-Collection Gang
---
So today? At what time and where does he appear?
---
Thanks bro, I was debating which character to do it on first
---
U have been possessed by the soul of baken
---
at time of this post, xur will arrive in ~6 hours
---
So if I kill you with lord of wolves, while u are using an auto rifle Im better than you? Good to know...
---
I would say this is accurate but: I can speed up the mountaintop reload with perks, but not the charge up time on jotunn.
---
Yes. It‚Äôs a different launcher.
---
Still my favorite D2 raid. Last wish probably ties, but the d2 year 1 nostalgia is too strong.
---
Need a link to the video?
---
I can feel the pain in this pic
---
I mean I still have my old own clan,  Icarus Flight.  The thing is I like the big rewards en big clan feeling. Never achieved that with my own,  the only thing i like is the name.
---
&gt;Fuck why didn‚Äôt I think of that. Hunters void grenades suuuuuuuuuck
---
shuro chi wish, use one raid banner and orpheus rig, every time you orhepus you get grenade energy back. easy 70-80 kills within 20 seconds. entrie quest step done in around 2-3 minutes.
---
Bro you must have like 200 hours lol you stupid
---
1. True they should give them a one shot ability.
---
2. Their supers do not give an over shield. They give heightened defense, mobility, and SOME OF THEM CAN kill you twice. 
---
3. You are not in the Matrix. 
---
4. The most they will do is nerf strikers, possibly tweak Stormcaller, and maybe do something to Dawnblade. 
---
Now for hunters
---
1. Golden Gun is essentially a Sleeper shot pre nerf. 
---
2. Blade barrage... can kill you with just 2-3 knives. 
---
I do think that Hunters need buffs however they need to do something about Golden‚Äôs aim assist.
---
You said it was "physically impossible" and when I spell it out for you how it isn't you ignore it and just insult me lmao. If you actually think the average game of gambit, prime or not, lasts 5 minutes or less you're lying to yourself.
---
Yup and I didn't get it when it was practically free  
---
 *sad guardian hours*
---
They will still leave after chests though, very sad
---
Damn. It'd be nice if buying expansions or whatever was just account wide. Kind of lessens the usefulness of cross-save if it still means I have to buy twice. (No longer the base game, but still expansions twice? Seems like there should be at least a discount if you already own it on another platform.)
---
Do you want to be with them in the moonlight?
---
The main game up until shadowkeep goes FTP. But shadowkeep and on is not, from what I understand.
---
Exactly what I said, you get one shot not because of the damage of the melee but from being shoved into an object which depending on the map can happen very easily.
---
As long as you hit fabled and complete the other objectives in the same season you are fine, if you hit fabled this season but don't finish the objectives you'll have to hit fabled again next season once you finish the objectives
---
I'll leave that here..
---
Agreed. At least the solstice packages can drop armour with enhanced perks. Gambit prime is the way to go for that step, matchesb are much quicker than standard gambit.
---
Those taken are 10ply, bud.
---
I could see the masterwork steps being "if you can't finish it", but I agree that the rest of the quest is tedious. I couldn't imagine doing the armor blind without knowing to save bounties, or the easiest order to do them in.
---
Nah just bad luck
---
Yeah, reddit can be toxic from time to time. Happy to hear you got all that dust I'm just gonna dismantle all my cosmetics then. Hopefully I can get 2k for the effect and again thank you for the comments really informative!

Guiding Light/treasure hunter

Combo detector

This is great news. Thankfully i managed to finish all mine a couple days ago but I'm happy for those that are still doing it to find out this news. My brother was almost burnt out after finishing his titan but now he says that he might do his warlock so this step must have had an effect on some people. It's great news that the final boss will count as 5 as well because that gives people a reason to stay and people who are doing it for the chests will benefit as well because the grind was that painful that many felt they needed to cut corners and save time by leaving after the miniboss stage. Good on bungie for doing this. 
---
Now all they need to do is give shadowkeep preorderers who already have two tailed fox something else because that's straight bs lmao.
---
If I don‚Äôt transform into a hunter with super magical powers wielding the light by tomorrow morning ima get real upset real quick
---
I wish I had a clan that ACTUALLY DID STUFF. They‚Äôre not even like inactive, they just don‚Äôt do anything with others... All the time I always asked if anyone wanted to do raids or generally anything, and i always get no response back... I just want to do a raid ;(
---
Trains are the darkness confirmed
---
I think yes, I don't think is a problem, i want to leave this launcher asap.
---
Great advice from the chef.
---
Thanks for spitting in the faces of people that do quests when they come out
---
You talking mad shit for someone in OEM LoW and bottom tree striker shoulder charge distance
---
It's a tough life, pickin' orbs and farmin' minibosees.  But sure as Xol's got halitosis, it beats fightin' sweats in comp.
---
But why tho
---
Clearly you don‚Äôt use them enough to realize that getting a direct hit only leads to a one-shot on supers like half the time. Not as bad as sentinel, but hit reg is bad enough on hammers that people can sometimes walk right out of what looks like a direct hit even while not in super. Despite the cluster explosion you absolutely still have to aim. 
---
If anything is getting a buff, it won‚Äôt be burning maul. That thing just got a buff and no one has really brought up how it‚Äôs still just meh (and idk how they would fix that, its main problem is that it can be easily countered if your target jumps). No matter the case, unless they just give it an insane duration buff or something, I still doubt it could be op.
---
You could say that about 95% of the things in this game
---
I sadly don't have it. I heard it just doesn't have flinch
---
Love seeing all the people bitching about it who've already finished this portion.  lol
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I guess you don't understand that 90% of the players in the game dont have 20 hours a day to play.  Sure its a hard grind and you did it.  Congrats!
---
But there are a lot of other portions of the game, I am sure you cheesed to get what you wanted.  Just consider this another cheese.
---
For a reward, why dont you sprout one of the banners you got for sitting in orbit switching between your character and console while your buddies walked calmly through Zero Hour.
---
Even if it is him, deserves this karma for thinking it through to that level.
---
Great induction by the way.
---
Good
---
YO SAME!!! HMU InsaneZach#1927
---
I feel attacked
---
Yeah, but in strike playlists
---
I just barely got the blue set for my Titan last night (probably should look up how to complete stuff more efficiently tbh), but even I'm starting to feel a bit burnt out already. Nothing they ask for is explicitly hard to do so far, it's just a tall order when you only have an hour or so after work to play.
---

You cant buy the base game digitally only the complete collection and it's $40. You could try GameStop for the base game.
---
Here‚Äôs the sad part...
---
I did it the legit way. No cabal engineer cheese
---
You can't buy the base game anymore on B.net. You can either get the Forsaken Complete Collection, or buy an activation key from retailers, and that can vary wildly. I have seen some keys going for between 5 and 10 dollars at some point, though.
---
Nah it‚Äôs just for the solcitice orbs

This is an easy challenge. Just play all the other challenges and you will have the 1500orbs without farming for them.

Thanks so much!!

Now we just need a Sunbreaker getting hit by a train and the trinity will be complete
---
It‚Äôs all fun and games till the darkness actually strolls right in
---
I love the idea of gambit all LOT, as a long time DS vet invading is a lovely mechanic.
---
Its just really fucking annoying with so many afks and four stacks, its not your fault you know? You just sit there and lose
---
me: ALRIGHT, WHO WANTS TO JUMP OFF A CLIFF?
---
I have the curated roll and I feel like a god using it
---
Yep, basically it doesn‚Äôt help your grind so why finish it
---
*cries in niobe‚Äôs torment*
---
Fucking THANK YOU.
---
All titans are, well, titans, hunters always seem to disappear after you shoot at them once, and every warlock has their own major flaw, we‚Äôre all one stupid family!
---
I hate you
---
Let‚Äôs be honest tho drifter is probably the only cool character in the game.
---
How you guys get this pic of me?
---
I never knew you could strafe to control it I always over shoot it when I play warlock
---
Played destiny on and off since d1 beta. Can confirm d2 is much better. Recently went back to d1 for the first time since 2016 and while i enjoyed the nostalgia trip there is no comparison. There is just simply much more to do in d2, d1 feels dead and empty by comparison. The only thing i preferred in d1 was mars and the tower. Pretty much everything else is better in d2 from the cosmetic customization to the sheer amount of content.
---
Do regular gambit, and it is based off how many orbs YOU collect not the team :( make sure you are using solar weapons as well! The armor challenges aren't very clear, but that's what gives Destiny it's mysterious charm
---
He won't have an inventory better than last week........
---
You heard it here first lol.
---
And they see me coming a mile away. You forget they see you no matter what. You can't fight when they see your next move before you can do it. Just get rid of the name plate wall hacks and make it something that isn't so one sided. I'm tired of kids with Truth hitting me across the map just cause they see my name plate. Take that away from them and they fold easy. Bet on it
---
You have to have all 3 majestic sets when doing the steps
---
Oh hope they do I want a big fuck off Sparrow lol
---
Hammer inbound
---
He ain't no rocket scientist, but at least in Destiny he can be in space.
---
Depends on what you want from it ;)
---
Here WE come!
---
The only difference between AA on console (controller) and PC (kbm) is sticky reticule. KBM still gets the same hit box benefits from AA as controller, aka magic bullets.
---
Yeah and I also feel one thing that factors into that is people see other people play really good with hunters and they want to try and do that but they want hand outs like a free win for being a Hunter but they usually are not willing to practice and learn their abilities and builds they could use then they come to Reddit and bungie forums and complain about hunters being bad and they need buffs
---
The tower has a limit of like 20 players, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a good idea and it would only lead to people repeatedly loading into towers, trying to find help. Plus nobody ever sat at the tower and was like ‚Äùoh man, I really NEED to help this poor dude over there.‚Äú, it‚Äôs always been an instance that‚Äôs just about picking up stuff and sorting through loot at the postmaster. We‚Äòve been doing this since 2014.
---
I hope they do see me coming, its called a distraction.  Focus on me while my teammates get the kill.  The invader is a glowing red objection, not hard to miss if you are paying attention and know the spawns too.  4 v 1, the odds are in your favor, just need to take advantage of it.
---
Thank you very much! I am almost Fabled but not done with the headshot part (almost done though) so wanted to make sure before I just said eff it after hitting Fabeled and hammered the headshots.
---
Actually, you didn‚Äôt get the kill, you missed and it gave you your shot back 1 second after you missed.
---
I mean they essentially did in away, it‚Äôs called Beloved for a reason.
---
I know this, but the stickiness still makes a huge difference. I play on both and can snipe much easier on console.
---
All due respect, but do you think I haven't tried google already?
---
This isn't always the case. I've used OEM in pvp and so has my brother. We both agree that it's broken. End of.
---
Pretty big talk from someone in punching distance...
---
I get a lot of use out of sidearms, more so than a shotgun or fusion rifle.
---
I know that the Lance has that no fall off but an arrows don't have falloff either (and are way more satisfying). 
---
Lance is hitscan though, I'll give it that.
---
As someone who plays all three...you can‚Äôt take Missile from me!

Lmao Chris Chan would like to know your location
---
We are god slayers but as we have learned we are VERY vulnerable because of our percieved immortality. 
---
All the hive has to do is make more devourer shit and the guardians are boned.
---
Also, I don't wanna be that guy, hit the army of Calus bots vs all the guardians might not go so well for us since he knows how to drain our light and kill us permanently. Who is to say others won't learn this?
---
This is the best thing I've seen this morning. Bravo!!
---
Here ya go boss enjoy
---
https://youtu.be/41jHqi0Mz1c
---
the only issue with izanagi is the serious sniper flinch, you pretty much have to kill all the adds if you want to stand a chance.
---
Thanks for the input
---
It's kinda hard to see that if they are hiding behind a dense object obstructing their view so I can't see them, meanwhile they see me the whole time. Again, one sided. And did I mention Truth?
---
I mean the Hive know that and we have been dealing with it since Crota's first battle on the moon. 
---
I know that those bots are "powerful" but we are us. We (the players) have never lost and are the most powerful things in existence, purely in terms of what we have beaten. I mean, raids have been solo'd. 
---
Lore wise, sure, we could be boned, but that's not what Calus wants, Calus wants us to fight with him, kill for him, and make him the last being alive
---
What I wanna know is why supers go through Servitor immunity but not Goblin immunity
---
I think it would be more accessible if it was in the game itself, but raid posts are still going to say KWTD if its posted in game or on the app.
---
AYAYAYAAAYAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
Everyone ignoring you then someone suggests your method an hour later and IT FUCKING WORKS
---
Yeah the problem is most of the solstice armor quest steps have you grinding outside of the EAZ, where you earn keys but no packages. There's a serious imbalance.
---
Plus you could spend all your time in the EAZ but if you're not great at finding the chests at the end it won't help.
---
Yeah, need to get to lost sectors. This is ak easy fix.
---
Id slam you for your lame insults but titans arent know for being smart
---
Yes. But only for classes with the legendary sets unlocked, right?
---
The Farm
---
Better reload my half full handcannon when there‚Äôs a one shot enemy 5 metres away ;)
---
I want to do Leviathan for Await The World-Eater, but I feel like I would get flamed out of existence by disgruntled teammates.
---
Idk about hardest, but definitely coolest. Seeing much you've moved around the massive arena after the fight is one of my favourite things.
---
You ever just score 80 motes in a round for ur team?
---
Cant wait for Crota
---
if anyone goes in a straight line and doens't do anything it's usually lagging on your part
---
WHAT\_ITS\_LIKE\_TO\_PLAY\_TITAN.mov

Thanks man
---
That fight legit is absolutely nuts. I wish more people did it but also god I'd hate to LFG for it.
---
Titans do we cant go 10 seconds without titans complaining about pve, and when a warlock posts something reasonable like correcting the animation time on their melees titans were complaining
---
I‚Äôd love to have it where once you obtain a roll, you can reselect every roll you‚Äôve found from collections.
---
Only problem with this, is it would shake up the resource economy, making everything useless and enticing no one to keep anything, unless the cost was much higher than the dismantle gain.
---
Gambit is not nearly as bad as everyone makes it out to be.
---
Much better than comp that's for sure.
---
Hah Titans are too busy saving the universe and being badasses, but you warlocks can hide in the corner with your smug smartness though!
---
ZA WARDUO
---
Hmmm I assume the statue thingy then
---
Vanilla D1 was cancer you needed like 30 materials per legendary which only dropped like 7 in the raid
---
i dont have the season pass so i cant play prime :/
---
heard its much quicker
---
well i want the armor though.
---
Not really! Most people do it to enjoy the rest of the season with like good roll gear but once armor 2.0 goes live it will be kinda useless. Still debatable though but we‚Äôre getting a live stream soon that showcases how the armor works.
---
I personally unlocked the legendary gear and all I‚Äôm doing now is focusing on the preparation for the next season. Like collecting materials and stuff or finishing unfinished business
---
Exactly, key word there is ‚Äúyou‚Äù :)
---
never said its hard, never said i dont win. 
---
i just dont like it and i would never waste my time playing 10 matches
---
It's quicker when the afk farmer is on your team throwing
---
yh its not hard but just a big waste of time.
---
and borring
---
It is not really a problem. It's more like something I wish was in the game. It is really easy to use the phone, I agree and I did use it. I raided, I did whisper and outbreak with bungie app and so.many more. I, personally, am very awkward in social situations and I think having it in game would help with it. It's a matter of maintaining the fantasy. In game I am a warlock, in real life I work an office job. I stay in game. I use phone only for Ishtar commander (I know it defeats my point lol, but it's funny).
---
Other than that, people really are lazy. I really think more people would raid with it in game. Even the same configuration, exactly like on the site.
---
Bold words for someone within OEM Juggernaut Striker Fists of Havoc Tractor Cannon sliding distance.
---
true true, i did 1-2 the first day of days but now i just want to get it over with
---
You really do hate OEM, don‚Äôt you?
---
That..... Are they delusional? Haha that's even worse than mine. Cause at least in my case the person could not be paying attention to what's happening to someone. With yours there is a game report to show otherwise.
---
Classic titans
---
And to add on, we may be in the dawning era of BrayTech so I‚Äôll be looking forward to coming back as an ExoüòÜ

Leave it to a Titan to make a grammar mistake ü§™ü§£üòÇ
---
I‚Äôm r√©t√†rt√©d what nightfall does it drop from again?
---
Titans=nerfkings
---
Get off of the sub
---
Get off of discord
---
Get off of reddit
---
Get off of destiny
---
Ahhh and then you got a message I imagine saying you were gonna get banned. Yeah, you won‚Äôt. According to the hate mail I should‚Äôve been banned since House of Wolves but here I am.
---
Drop in and start playing get d1 while you're at it
---
BrayTech... Elon Musk... ElonTech... I like it.
---
The amount of titan meme spam on this sub has gotten way too high
---
Yeah, all of that content will still be there for you to play. Not all weapons/armor will be brought over to Shadowkeep, but all the played content will be the same.
---
Moons haunted
---
i can hear the sarcasm all the way over here
---
Block this
---
man i gotta get me one of those kids.
---
where can i get one?
---
Which shader is this? Is it from IB?
---
In solstice 2018 we got an exclusive exotic ship that looks like a fighter jet from star wars. I still use it to this day.
---
I think Bungie had it in mind to give a shitty sparrow, so that people who couldn't put enough time to grind out 3 armor sets don't feel like they're missing out.
---
Its not hard when you're doing the liars handshake "strat" lol
---
I ended up finding a spot where lots of fallen spawn and used the void light grenade with some armament mods to kill them as they spawned, but it took me forever to find a good spot. I was trying strikes with grenadier, but people were picking off everything before I got kills so a nightfall would probably have been the way to go.
---
Yea much faster and way more fun
---
Gear transfers but you just won‚Äôt be able to play the content
---
Yeah we're planning to do the puzzle this week. Thanks, though!
---
Uh. Where do you get damage falloff with snipers?
---
Man, so easy to get. Just your local single mother on Tinder
---
i agree, What?
---
I just googled it because I don't feel like uploading a picture of it on social media. Hopefully this link works. Otherwise just google it yourself. It's called "Estival Excursion"

---
I thought it was only guaranteed on your first completion ever
---
Lol when you don't 1 phase the boss.
---
It's a habit I have good thing it has drop mag though
---
Dawnblade is broken for sure....but Golden Gun? Really? It is a very high risk -high reward. It's the only super that doesn't give an over shield. Can't instakill another super...you're reaching
---
no im just not a monkey that cant tell the difference between destiny and tetris
---
you deadass just told me you‚Äôd rather supers be overtuned, and that you hate being killed by shotguns, snipers, and mida (pulses in d2 are basically d1 mida)
---
so
---
you probably just run around with super mods and sit on heavy because you have to crutch on broken shit to get kills
---
Earlier today I had all of the EAZ specific requirements left for my renewed warlock armour and I just kept doing other shit bc i kept getting sidetracked. So pretty much, I relate heavily.
---
Oh, sorry, I should have read that.
---
All good
---
Actually thank you for replying because I forgot the panic nuclear weapon hunters have but let me debunk this point first
---
So to begin it‚Äôs not high risk since if I see you with my max stat insta kill you‚Äôre done unless you‚Äôre a sniper and can flick to me jumping in the air to see you fast enough
---
It‚Äôs fully automatic and refunds ammo so it takes effectively one bullet to drop a super, or a headshot drops a super, either way, you‚Äôre wrong
---
I won‚Äôt talk about how absurdly broken it is in gambit, so I‚Äôll just leave it there, but please, debunk the other 5 broken supers hunters have combined with their ridiculous neutral game considering they‚Äôre the dominant class in the crucible
---
LOL omg
---
No I use actual weapons and don't just camp
---
That sounds like so much fun. I may do that this weekend.
---
Offer still stands. Mind telling me the joke?
---
Remember: Devotion, Bravery, Sacrifice, Death
---
Not gonna lie, ya almost had me at the end there.
---
Anyone notice that the enhanced hand cannon aim on the chromatic fire says it reduces flinch when firing "bows"?
---
Sadly I feel out of destiny 2 after the first raid simply because me and my friends no lifed the game too hard and had to wait a long time for content and we left 
---
But. The most frustrating thing I have ever experienced was doing the raid. Getting to the very last phase and...chubby fat fuck glitches on one of his animations making him invulnerable for the last small sliver of health. 
---
This was after several failed attempts that were getting better and we fucking nailed down the phases. Sadly this must have gotten into our heads cause it took like a dozen more attempts after to finally beat it.
---
You can choose when to do it, I would recommend on a 2nd character.
---
Ice breaker broke balance just like gjallrhorn did, shadestep is just like dodge in this game where it just kills your aim assist because reasons
---
Gow on it and learn. I did. Now the shit is fun!!
---
80 hours for all 3 including masterworks
---
I wish Chromatic Fire was better, such a good looking exotic.
---
What? You‚Äôre still getting 15. Being 300 light is irrelevant.
---
You can do solstice right after you finish red war
---
I bought it too when she was selling the ace of spades ornament and his ship, it‚Äôs probably a glitch
---
Combine that with Thorn and Felwinters and you had a salty Crucible lobby.
---
Honestly it is for some
---
Amethyst veil. It‚Äôs super dark and fantastic
---
No skill required to post clips
---
OEM was the only the 2nd time I sprung for silver by buying the Jian Ornament for the mask.
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm telling him, being 300 light is irrelevant when EAZ is 200 light.
---
He kinda dumb, like asking for flairs for free
---
You can leave and come back and still get credit for Solo-nely Triumph when you finish.
---
Always rifled barrel, no discussion needed
---
You can just not open the first chest. Bam infinity this means nothing.
---
Anything. I will do anything if it could seriously upgrade my vault. Airborne sidearm kills of Gambit invaders using an arc super? Done, if I get a vault upgrade. I‚Äôd even run Reckoning

Heh

I'd think that's better than them hurting others. Putting to rest then?

Anyone remembering this happening to Mr fruit
---
Oof. Bungo‚Äôs matchmaking is bad. Nice name btw. Flavortown
---
I actually like regular more. It may be slower, but a lot of Prime matches turn into steamrolls. If you have a bad start there‚Äôs little to no chance of recovery because the snowballing is so bad.
---
Which seal should I go for after dredge and reckoner

I don't get it.

Genichiro from Sekiro in a nutshell

And the next game i got connection issues which for some fuck knows reasons counted as quitted game  and lost more points......  
---
Man im loving comp in this game
---
As a player who dislikes crucible, 200 arc super kills is my least favorite part. (Warlock)
---
Yes
---
It‚Äôs 200 arc super kills anywhere
---
They can't insult hunters, we're too perfect
