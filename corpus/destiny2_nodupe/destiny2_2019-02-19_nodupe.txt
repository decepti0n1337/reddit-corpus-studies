Yes. I finished Mercury and Mars in probably 1 or 2 afternoons each. There's not a ton there in either location if you're looking to just see the story and the adventures

If the stars align, you can kill up to 7 guardians. Kill 3 and if somehow get the rest of them with any AoE super, only if the stars ever align. I killed 5 with Blade Barrage by accident when they spawned on the delayed explosion after the Blade Barrage tweak, and that is when I realized I can kill up to 7.
---
Great job Meks 
---
Same reason fighting lion is a primary grenade launcher. It's an exotic and it's supposed to be powerful. Like above, just learn to counter it. Changing the item isn't always the answer. 
---
Why did you post this here?
---
Im im the middle of osiris and i want to start forsaken could i go back and finish
---
The unknown is Izanagis, I have lemon and it still shows up for me
---
I have a buddy who did something similar. Killed 3 with Bygones, the last Guardian ran to spawn. The 3 respawned and he Blade Barraged them all. 
---
What sale? I havn't got anything in Battle.net...?
---
Yes, this is not related to Destiny 2. This sub is for related content.

In the Scourge of the Past raid lair, during the boss dps phase everyone is given a buff (continuous, angular, or parallel) and they have to match with the other person who has their buff to do more damage and to not die. To accomplish this, people use a triangle with a buff at the top or bottom (in this case angular) and the other 2 at left and right (continuous and parallel). The buffs are also assigned a shape because in the previous encounter, you receive buffs from terminals showing the respective shape (continuous = circle, angular = triangle, parallel = square)
---
Yes, you can start Forsaken as soon as you reach level 30, and the other campaigns will be exactly as you left them. 
---
[removed]
---
Saw this yesterday, its unreal all over a fucking handcannon 
---
Thank you for letting me know
---
In scourge of the past, there are three buffs that players can receive during the final boss damage phase. It will always be three pairs. The three buffs you can get are angular, continuous, and parallel, angular being a triangle symbol, continuous a circle , and parallel a cube.
---

---
If, during the damage phase, two players stand next to each other with the same buff(its random) they get a huge damage increase. The way the community has organized the locations for where to go if you have a certain buff is, from left to right, continuous, angular, parallel (C.A.P.).
---
Theres always one fuckhead who hecks it up tho. 
---
Scourge of the past positioning. Each team member get a debuff(Continuous, Angular, Pararell) having 2 people the same debuff, if these 2 guys stay together they get a damage buff, if not you get tethered (i believe(?), haven't done the raid yet) 
---
Thats why i run Nova bomb its effective and hilarious !
---
Invader kills dont equal success, keep being a loser
---
thats exactly what happened
---
You got Bergusian Night after First Encounter. I hate you. (Not really. But WEEEEHHHHH).
---
You didn’t even check the perks.
---
Rule 2. 
---
The last mission is pretty tasty. Bring a friend.
---
What's the issue? You don't have to pay off you don't want to
---
You get used to it after a while
---
I don't think it's wrong what they are doing. I mean you have free choice as to whether you want to accept. They are providing a service. If no one pays for it then they earn no money. But if people are willing to pay. Then so be it.
---
I surprise myself with that outlook as I help people through raids and whisper and nightfalls and never ever charge. I just do it to be friendly. But I don't hold it against people who do charge. I mean I pay lawyer if I need legal advice. Or a mechanic if I need my car fixed.

What leg armor is that
---
I can just hear the lens being pecked lol

They appear as blue dots on your radar in strikes and Gambit.

Nope, I would be in favor of the nfs on a set rotation though.

There are several things in the TOS that prohibit this kind of thing. Also as a general rule of thumb, real world trading is almost always a bannable offense in any game (whether enforced is different, but I’ve never read a tos that didn’t include something forbidding such). 
---
THAT'S WHAT THEY SAID!
---
Thanks man!!!
---
Guns - yes, but armor does not fit...
---
It’s common. I’ve had it happen quite often in the past. If you ever create a Warlock the ornament will be available to you. 
---
Bröther it is you
---
Never said they weren't,  I said I'm not interested in more gambit. Do you know how to read?
---
Sorry let me be more clear. If you unlock lunafaction boots which is a warlock only exotic armour piece you can get ornaments that change the appearance. The ornament can be earned by any character and 'unlocked'. But the lunafaction boots themselves can only be worn by the warlock. What you have unlocked are not the boots themselves but a cosmetic item for the boots 
---
That's that make sense?
---
Nevermind, I dont argue/correspond with the creepy anime folks. Good day to you
---
Right ... understood. Thanks. I didnt knew it ... i know i can buy some stuff from Xur for i i have Exotic helmet for Warlock but never expected to get it when i play Hunter :) 
---
Its actually a good thing though (for it to take a while) -- I've learned to take my time after rushing to max light in past updates and having nothing left to do.  I hit max on all 3 characters, despite going slow, and now I'm nearly out of stuff to do with a month to go before the next update.
---
No.
---
Now i know that playing other characters i can get other stuff for different characters - so this was strange for me ... noob i\`m ... lol :))))
---
Youtube will be your friend to answer your question. Any youtuber video explaining how to get past the green jumping puzzle will give you 10-13 min to get past the stages where you have to kill enemies. Or just go to the destiny discord lfg and get carried.
---
The glitch is fixed but despite huge kill studies by players you're still looking at a &lt;1% drop rate increase with 5x heavy ammo finder.
---
Awesome ty 
---
Somebody make the Eric andre meme with ghost.
---
I tend to get tons of Hunter stuff for my Titan. It’s quite annoying at times. 
---
You won't unlock exotic armor for them though unless you play as them.
---
O yea
---
Especially when you not opened up all your other exotic or other stuff ... 
---
&gt; You’re the first one to ever hear this story
---
Guys...should we...should we tell them?
---
Warmind theme sounds like a cannon to the gut

MORE MEMES
---
My friend has had this glitch since week 5 of Forsaken
---
The official Bungie download has labeled them as Whisper of the Worm and One Thousand Voices, so I'm choosing to trust that over some random Youtube guy.
---
Lunas howl 
---

Final step I suppose to be more accurate.
---
I wish :(
---
I don't have any bass in my Destiny 2. For some reason it just doesn't work. So I'm forced to play with completely flat audio :(
---
I would like to know as well 
---
Proud of you though!
---
Well i got my second seed of light from the blind well (the oracle) so yuore not wrong
---
I got mine 3rd run. Good luck to the guardians with no relations to rngesus
---
😂
---
Private matches are the only thing you're gonna get into with a fireteam of 11-12 like that, silly.  But this sure was funny to see! :)
---
just did so today. yes. 
---
I’ve done it once and got one thousand voices from it. 
---
Haven’t done any campaign, she still spawns there for me
---
Eh, at least you get to go to town on ads with Supers while you’re waiting.
---
I am in awe of your aiming skill then.
---
I wont be touching my NF quest until something happens that drastically changes the comp experience, because that grind for Lunas was insufferable 
---
See it's not broken!
---
^^/s
---
She disappears when you gotta hunt barons on the tangled shore but you can see her by going to the dreaming city, jnlockable with a quest
---
Ohh, well that might help me a little as I didn't even know what order the forges were. Only knew that those labs were last
---
I use yahoo
---
To be fair boss grinding isn’t the main grind. If you can OHKO a level 170 Heavy Gunner that level 40 boss needs some handicap.
---
**laughs in Nova Bomb**
---
While he is the weakest of the 5 worm gods, the worm gods are/we're still considered beings of immense power, and second only to the darkness itself. They were the source to Oryx and his sisters, so you'd think, despite being the weakest of the 5, Xol would still show considerable power and be more than just a single mission. I know that the guardians have defeated strong enemies so they've gotten stronger, but it isn't like they fed off of their kills like the hive, so I don't think a guardian would grow exponentially in strength to easily kill Xol. It was a poor climax to a potentially good villain. 
---
I know Bungie made Xol into Whisper as a canon way to bring the gun back and show "oh look! Xol didn't truly die" but that's also poor story telling. He could've been a raid layer that gave the exotic, or have a round 2 type in a strike that wasn't the mission all over again. Like we think we defeat him, but he breaks his husk and emerges bigger, but borrows into the ground, and that leads us to do a strike to kill him. 
---
Also, despite being a worm god, Xol is weaker than Oryx because of Sword Logic. I don't care what Ghost says when seeing him, Oryx clearly displayed a bigger threat. Doxology clap seems like the strongest attack in the game, as it's basically him calling on the darkness to wipe the guardian's existence
---
You do not lose glory when a non fireteam member on the same team as you leaves in a comp match.
---
you gotta claim the triumph
---
Oh, I tought I did that too? But just to be safe I'll check once I get off from work
---
It's not a grand discovery and I know this, that's why it's called a suggestion. The downside is that after you choose the nightfalls, you can't do the rest of them after reset. This comes from the frustration of not being able to get Horrors Least and it's the last thing I need in order to get CB. This would also help the people getting Wayfarer, and many other things. I feel it's a nice alternative rather than hoping you'll randomly get the right nightfall. Another alternative is having the nightfalls in a predetermined rotation, but then that makes more time gates.
---
Mr negative over here
---
It matters to me that I at least made it to max level at some point
---
Riven was ready to die. She got tired of being imprisoned
---
Actually, yes. That is my favorite strike too, but I hardly ever see the cabal or vex bosses D:
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The secret to a good, long-lasting fight is to make it feel like you're always able to keep progressing and slowly wither their health away. Not having to tickle them down by 1/4 then have to wait another 20 seconds before being able to damage it again. 
---
That's just a lazy way to extend the fight. It really kills the quality and engagement you would have of being in a real battle. 
---
It really takes you out of the moment: "Oh, this is so intense we can do it guys! Wow look at that damage, this might be easier than I thought! \*dumps a super onto the boss\* .....  \*Immune\* Oh.. one sec, sorry, I forgot we need to wait for him to finish jerking off before we can hit him again."
---
It even has me going to the point of leaving the strike if I see its the fanatic one. Its just such a chore, needlessly long, and its just annoying.
---
I really do also wish the Warden's servitor had more health and the secondary bosses are summoned faster. Its actually the coolest strike boss with the most unique mechanics but you hardly even see them because the boss just disappears in 2 blade barrages the moment he spawns.
---
I still use that from last year on my warlock.
---
C for corners wtf man we had it
---
Holy hell that was spicy. Took me and a bud a good couple hours. 
---
Which they in turn stole from the playstation 2 classic Jak 2 and it’s called the peace maker 
---
Yeah I hate how it’s blue at first, all calm and stuff, then you press start and get flashbanged
---
Wow that does sync up pretty well, though I feel a bit more of a... weeb vibe from the video, maybe..? Koko soko would also pair well?
---
Literally worse than that freaking invisible vandal strike before it was fixed..
---
Nah, bungie knew what we wanted after D1, Destiny 2 had no excuses. Anthem is something new for BioWare, even if it isn’t new for the genre. 
---
Range MW on this and trust is great imo. I had trouble getting my solar kills with trust. I got a Range MW, it has range and triple tap, mostly pve but that range actually is helping me in CP to get some kills lol
---
r/destinymemes exists so memes shouldnt be here
---
Not forgotten 
---
VOG when someone would jump down during the explanation. Good times
---
Once
---
They still haven’t fixed everything. 
---
You could technically get more if you double headshot after the third kill but that extremely very very unlikely in and of itself. In my many many invasions only got a double headshot 3 times and sent back if I hit the 4 kill mark
---
I finished the kills yesterday on match 22, I think. Now I just need to get to 40 matches. 
---
Absolutely agree. 100%
---
I think Anthem getting 'some' hate is an understatement
---
If only I was and to get the darn Joten... Still grinding
---
"They should just give us things instead of content\*

When I start a new game in Destiny I want it to cut straight to the end credits and give me every item in the game.

This so much. Cant count how many times i clutched a game in trials last man standing while putting a bubble on the bomb. 
---
no you can't
---
Some good ol (new) ZacOut while destroying peeps in Crucible, Nice
---
Ehhhhh. If I have a bad team in crucible I can still have fun. If I have a bad team in Gambit I feel like there is nothing I can do. 
---
Ugh I fucking despise the Fanatic. Next time I do the strike I refuse to do it without 3 Celestial Nighthawks to kill him instantly.
---
Sweet Business + Lunafaction Boots made the kills and multis a cakewalk.
---
Reminds me of the reason skeleton king got changed to wraith king.

*We put a crown on a skeleton* **Original Character Do Not Steal**

*We put a skull on a gun* **Original Concept Do Not Steal**

Yes
---
Acrius 3shots them I believe, at reasonable range too. Perfect monster for tearing them down and the Ikelos as backup. The adds are easily obliterated if at least one person is paying attention, so shouldn't have to worry about Arc damage on Vault. But Riskrunner is insane for the Heartrun!
---
Audition for the role of Austin Powers.
---
To add on, only 4 in a mag converted to the 1 powerful bullet can one shot bodyshot in crucible, 2 and 3 will not
---
That's good to hear haha. I see nothing but negativity. I'm curious to see how it turns out.
---
Yeah man 100% agree. Rampage is nice but Killclip on a high impact frame is just nuts. I'll just keep sacrificing my components to RNG and hope for the best...
---
Oh they can both be great fun but work on getting them to 50 or it’s really not the same. 
---
Oh heck, I did not think about that, gotta get Luna before then I guess.
---
At least I know now what to do on the weekend\^\^
---
as long as it doesn't require me to go kill the enemy team. I suck in pvp, i dont have dredgen because I still didnt manage to wipe the other team two more times. I get insta killed pretty much always. 
---
You can, if you are not in a fireteam, fast traveling puts you in a different instance, hopefully one where others are still doing it.

I've been trying to feel good about D2, but since playing vanilla D2, i'm still slightly salty about the masterwork core change every time I get a light level upgrade to a weapon type I hate. Also it's noticeable that a good percentage of people **still** don't have masterworked weapons outside of exotic catalysts. 
---
Granted they added more ways to get them, now that you have to use them 30x more than before, it still feels like a net loss. 
---
Awesome! Thx for the tips. So far I’ve been using “ outrageous fortune “ as heavy weapon. I like it because it has the auto loader perk. But I have not been paying much attention to my heavy weapon cause most of the time I only use it when it is realy needed 😄
---
*Booming laughter in bottom tree striker*

Just scribble something down and let OP have his moment

Why is this here? Even if you get kicked you can still chat with founder and members. This seems like something you should discuss with them.

lol
---
Destiny 2 was where Bungie wanted to do everything they wanted to do in destiny 1 but better, and unfortunately it blew up in their faces as deadlines rushed towards them and they couldn't implement everything perfectly. As developers they have a million excuses, and plenty of them are valid. I hate to always hop on the Activision hate train but I really think they impacted launch as much as Bungies iffy ideas (4 man crucible and all that shit). 
---
shit, my bad!

I’d recommend it, I’ve been playing destiny since year 1 of d1 myself also, and it’s pretty fun, I mean sure I wish they’d bring back zhallo supercell (I’m Anaí to rifle guy, don’t judge. Lol) but yea it’s pretty fun, a quick tip if ur going into PvP, get good. Lol cuz there’s a lot of titans with one eyed masks running around (I’m one of them, muah ha ha ha ha 😈 lol) but yea and uhh, well a lot of people will tell u, that PVP, is just bad right now or that destiny 2 sucks, or whatever, don’t listen to them, that is for u to decide, and u alone. Don’t let other people’s opinions persuade ur own, u know? And uh, yea, destiny 2 is pretty fun and well they do have SOME, exotics from d1, so yea you’ll see what I mean if u play it for ur self (or if u look it up lmao) but yea I recommend it!

Hunters should have raiden flux, warlocks bring skull of dire ahamkara and Titans can literally go striker and clear the entire enemy portion in 1 super
---
My sentiments exactly...
---
This for real. It's not even close to similar in timeframe between fixes and updates between the 2
---
I feel the same way.   I got the first 2 expansions with forsaken, and man i would be PISSED if I paid full price for Curse and warmind.  What a terrible expansion.  
---
Yeah I just got that three days ago it’s so cool to use
---
Cant really speak to the rest of your comment, but overheating is needed in my opinion, otherwise you can just fly away from any danger any time and enemy is near.  The overheating, and enemies using abilities to cause it, make your positioning matter more in higher difficulties.  You cant just run into the middle, spam abilities and fly out cuz you will get roasted in GM1 or higher.
---
Now out in the world I might agree that overheating is annoying but you pretty much can fly forever if you just keep hitting water pockets and waterfalls.
---
Hey fuck off that's my wife
---
Well, we have fast travel, masterworks and a class ability. Other than that I wouldn't say things are much better. Crucible is still full of lag (although I am enjoying it), pve game modes have little replay value, load times are pretty abysmal. Destiny 2 was meant to make it so we didn't need to keep going to the tower, but they added that back in lately. 
---
Lol how about instead of extra valor points we get x3 glory ranks cuz I still haven’t gotten my Luna’s howl. Lmao 
---
I said the game is amazing not specifically the reward/s. I really enjoy grind games such as diablo 1 good loot in a big bunch is overly satisfying for me. Obvs this is just my taste and opinion.
---
Lol it melts strike bosses to tho 
---
Also Subclasses are still really dumbed down, and the item perks are a little dull.
---
I'd rather take dunemarchers or lion rampant so I can fly into groups of dudes like a marvel hero and then break all of my bones crashing into a wall
---
Couldn’t you have at least clipped the video 
---
You dont NEED specifically what you said, and you dont need pvp at all. You personally want that for it to be goo to you.
---
Destiny fixed a lot of stuff but also have removed a lot and made a lot worse. Anthem is also getting very little praise 
---
I've heard the end game is non-existent in Anthem atm.
---
Oof! Will do
---
Judging by what Gladd has posted on Twitter, they need to fix the loot system a bit on Anthem.
---
You said it yourself: you played, but didn’t team up with your clan folks since you probably play at different times. Get yourself a new clan, today the weekly recruitment posts over at r/dtg and r/fireteams will be up again. Just pay more attention to the timezone, join their Discord and try to play some stuff with them. 
---
Okay so you create Destiny2 with no raids and ni Pvp. What are We doing in the game exactly? Stop trying to be smart 
---
I never understood the purpose of making that stuff so weak. They can obviously scale it like they do everything else.
---
"Here's some great looking stuff to protect you Guardian. Oh by the way, it's made out of paper."
---
Am I missing something? All I gathered was they fixed loading screen bugs? 
---
woah, special weapons can oneshot? /s
---
We ain’t gonna see trials again til 2098. 😂
---
I have a hard time thinking Activision came up with these ideas;
---
- Weapon slot changes with forced juggler modifier
---
- Removing strike specific loot
---
- Removing Trials because they don’t have a good prototype even though D1 Trials was highly regarded
---
- Replacing Raids with Raid Lairs
---
- The XP scam in year 1
---
- Insanely slow loading menu that hasn’t been fixed going on what, a year now?
---
- Removing permanent factions in place of a lame faction rally event
---
- The expensive infusion system
---
- Replacing the D1 skill tree
---
That’s off the top of my head. I get Activision is easy to blame but let’s be honest, Bungie creates a lot of unnecessary problems. D1 was great after TTK and they finally had the game where the fans really enjoyed it. Then they decided to release a half finished game with a lot of unnecessary changes and removed activities. 
---
I think Bungie has bad management and creates their own problems, Activision realized this and bailed. Just my theory though. The game is definitely improving but Bungie wasted a lot of valuable time and resources making fixes to their unnecessary changes. 
---
That would be nice, I don't want Anthem to be treated like Destiny was, or take as long as Bungie did. I want both games to succeed, I'm just tired of people saying Anthem is doing way better two weeks in when it is the exact same scenario.
---
;)
---
This isnt really true though.
---
Destiny 1 launched and was short of just about everything people were looking forward too.  It took roughly 80 dollars more and a year+ with the taken king to finally fix the game to the point where it was finally praised as being the game people wanted.
---
Then Destiny 2 came out and did the SAME THING.  You cant expect people to buy the launch game and 3 DLCS to finally get a solid game.  Destiny 1 a lot of people forgave and came back, but to do it again when the road map is already available just shows that the developers dont listen to their fans
---
I DO! LET US CHOOSE A PLANET FOR OUR HONEYMOON!

Same thing with my first Leviathan.
---
"Ok, so Callus is gonna start-"
---
*DING*
---
"SHIT WHAT DO WE DO?"
---
Every game has bugs on release which *not supposed to be there* its up to the developer how can they patch/hotfix it. Biow doing a good progress so far regarding hotfix that they can and already has a patch ready for day 1 to fix everything they can. The demo was an older build they used, tweeted it earlier thats why most of these bugs didnt show. 
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzhxP-pdos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzhxP-pdos)
---
Yeah
---
Nope, you're right, that's mostly it. I'm starting to get a feeling people are acting like this Day 1 patch is gonna turn the game magically from how people are putting faith into it.
---
I've played a little third person, but the lack of going exactly where I'm looking is annoying, that's me generally, gunplay I find lacking cause abilities are 'addictive' in a sense and shooting is generally an afterthought.
---
Masterwork + Enhanced GL Loader for the gear setup
---
the key is that you can "cancel" post-fire delay by pressing reload key as soon as you shoot it, which lets you ignore the 0.83 second delay after firing that comes from the gun's 72 RPM limit and go into reloading right away
---
Jump, strafe, the projectile can miss you if you’re smart. 
---
Even with the catalyst, I don't remember it reloading this fast
---
*italics cries in golden gun
---
By that logic /r/memes exists so we shouldn't post memes anywhere else.

yes, year 2 is pretty bad

which is correct.  the base game is fantastic though, but its def going to need to push out content rather quickly if its going to compete with the division 2
---
Worst Team translated every team.
---
I mean, anthem hasnt even officially launched yet right? How long did it take for them to fix issues in d1? Hell, it took almost a full year for them to fix issues with s2. By that point I was done. (I'm not getting anthem either).
---
Who the fuck uses a mic in cruicible? What is this MW2.

yes it is, its had years to get better.

ill take anthem over launch d1 or d2 though

I like Jöttun

All good opinions.  I think the abilities spam you have is more from playing Storm.  Colossus is great for gunplay.  I throw out my ordinance, shield bash some, flamethrower, and mow down all the extras with my autocannon or LMG.  Has a great flow to it and makes jumping into the thick of things fun.  Being supported by a Storm and Ranger from the back makes for a super fun party dynamic.
---
Anthem's issues are just as complex, once the bugs disappear people will see that more. Tbh I think it will be faster than D1 or 2, but still take 6 months
---
I got into a feud with another striker titan in clash once. We must've fist of havoc'd into each other in midair three or four times in the match.

its bare bones.

it wouldnt be that big an issue if there werent so many technical problems as well but theres a day 1 patch for that

Bungie/Activision took a long time to fix its shit.  It took bioware a week. Now that Activision is gone.  Let's see how long it takes for Bungie to fix d2.... Cause shit I haven't played sin e the break up.  Cause I know nothing special has been added or fixed.
---
Yeah, I recently got Jotunn and tried it during doubles this week... The tracking isn't that good. Pretty much any lateral or vertical movement caused the projectile to miss. Most of my kills were vs guys standing still (at heavy spawn), charging straight, or unobserved... I could have just as easily got those with pulse or hc. Same goes for aim &amp; charging the shot... In the same time I could get 2x pulse bursts off.
---
I found guys using Wishender a lot more annoying.
---
I did Crimson doubles with Jottun. I was getting matched with and against level 20-40ish players on PS4. They never knew what hit them 
---
I just want a transmog system. How come 99% of the time I have to choose fashion or function, but not both?
---
8 times longer? Are you using sidearms to damage the boss? Geesh...I can 1 man heroic this with no trouble. 
---
Now what takes a long time to make heroic is the taken blight PE in dreaming city, unless you have a few others that actually know what they're doing to help you.
---
I don't think Anthem will live long. We saw the same scenario with the division: quick updates, huge content, better graphics. But Destiny wins because of one thing: fun gameplay.
---
never go for 15, hell never go for 10 unless you're sure you can bank before an invader shows up or you just blew up an army with a super
---
Except Destiny took years to be worth the INITIAL asking price, and Destiny 2 took months. The fact that both weren't really worth it till the DLC started coming out is the bigger problem. Destiny 1 especially, holy shit. It took multiple DLC packs to be worth a damn
---
2500 kills, love playing doubles.
---
You realize it's getting endless hate just because EA's name is on it right? Atleast Destiny didn't have that issue. I enjoy both games, I enjoyed warframe for a while too. I don't understand how some people can be so childish and attack a game for having similarities to another, it's a shame people can't just enjoy things.
---
the heroic for this PE is you sitting next to frozen boss for 2 minutes, as opposed to you just vaporizing the boss with your super and heavy under 20 sec
---
He'd be the greatest hunter alive. Behind our Hunter that is lol.
---
This guy is a punk ass bitch
---
I think Bioware definitely deserves props for working on their fixes QUICKLY, but I also think that 
---
1) Part of the reason they're responding so quickly is that they've been watching the feedback for D1 and 2 (quite the advantage to launch Anthem with), and
---
2) People (angry Destiny players and just haters in general) are looking for an excuse to love Anthem and hate on Destiny more, so it's something of a self-fulfilling prophecy right now.
---
I'm definitely curious about Anthem (I'm a bigger Bioware fan in general than I am a Bungie fan), but the people already exclaiming how much better the game is than Destiny are mostly just getting caught up in launch hype (3rd person vs. FPS preference notwithstanding). Half of them will probably be salty as hell about Anthem in 6 months, just like they would've been with Destiny.

I'm almost sad I didn't go through all of this with the rest of the Destiny community. I started playing from Forsaken onward and I find the game quite awesome. Yes, even the PVP.
---
Well shit, I don't even have a decent Pulse Rife I swear I did somewhere. As for secondary the drops I get are horrible and never gotten the Ikelos shotty as no one stays around to the EP all the way to the end.   
---
I do have a shotgun, that is meh but will have to do. 
---
A true believer
---
Okay, I had close to the same except I was using Tigerspite and EP SG. You might consider trying a shotgun for the CQB. You're running Well of Radiance, right? Hopefully with Phoenix Protocol. 
---
Get a fireteam from r/fireteams or the companion app, go set up in the caves that are to the right as you enter the forge area. Stay in those caves, keep two people killing and one person throwing. Keep alternating your Well of Radiance, Healing Rift, and Healing Grenade. Try to save special ammo for blue boys, and use primary for the other ads. If things get crazy hectic, you can break out Thunderlord for a few shots but save that ammo for the boss. 
---
When you get to round 2, the thrower needs to be more accurate and hit between the spines, or hit the very bottom of the forge from any angle. Make sure to time things out and have supers/heavy for the boss because he's a tank. Use primary to knock out his shield drones, and make sure to keep tickling him so his shield doesn't go back up.
---
A good spot to sit when you get to the boss is over in the small cave that is in the back left when you enter the forge area. You can duck behind the box, set your Well/Rift there, and you don't have to worry about enemies on the side or behind you.
---
Arguably the most important thing is for your fireteam to be coordinated and work together. Communication can REALLY help so everyone knows when rift/well is going down, and when someone needs revived.
---
You don't think Destiny was praised for fixing its issues in TTK? And then praised again in Forsaken for reintroducing all of the good bits of D1 that were stripped out in D2Y1 for baffling reasons of which we'll never quite know the truth?
---
There's such a thing as being too generous ya know
---
Same thing happens with me sometimes. The difference is that we still lost. https://imgur.com/gallery/BinfmD3
---
The invisible ninja loadout - I like it.    I may give it a try in Iron Banner this week.  
---
still got my upvote :)
---
Do Last Wish, you'll get powerful drops from everything and you're at a light level where it's very doable 👍
---
Because you randomly said "nova bomb is better now", that had nothing to do with the person comment unless you were trying to tell him that nova bomb would kill the boss faster. In which case, why I replied what I did.
---
I was sitting at 787 the last I looked and that is a combo of the past two years. 
---
Its all fun and games when hunters and warlocks are having a blast but when a titan starts to have fun, everyone loses their minds!
---
My clan has this nasty habit of whining about anything titan-related or OEM and when asked what class they use they reply "hunters!"
---
I agree with you on this, I'm not trying to attack Anthem, I'm more just poking fun that Anthem has the benefit of not being released 2 years ago
---
i actually think they might show up at the end of annual pass.  my reasoning is that penumbra means the partially shaded outer region of the shadow cast by an opaque object.  so if this is infact thte darkness fleet, we may see it in the final season
---
Things like the Loot Cave lessens the grind in Destiny which is detrimental to end-game content and shortens its lifespan. Bungie's whole game is designed and dependent on grinding therefore they are more abrupt to fix exploits.
---
 Bioware has been very responsive to community feedback and showing that they have complete faith in their end game content. A faith I look forward to immensely testing this Friday.
---
Thanks very helpful 
---
*Laughs maniacally with a stream of red outlaw shots*
---
Mine is F so its just me spamming f to pay respect to myself
---
For what it’s worth, the Anthem patches have been in the work for a while. It’s not like they read Reddit comments and just immediately got to work. 
---
Hey wait, ur that dude I got the Titan build from? Nice! Lol alright ima check it out
---
I was doing Last Wish last week. Opened two chests and got two exotics.
---
"Hey guys. Do those chests drop exotics only? I got two"
---
One of them started playing like a week before me and got 3 times less exotics in drops. big oof
---
Oh, I am aware. 😈
---
Me and my best friend got it at the same time on our 15th run. A clan mate did it for the first time that day too with us and also got his. 
---
3x 1k voice in 1 raid. 
---
You sure this isn’t a pilot from titan fall 2
---
There is a lore book but it's only a part of it and more will be released later.
---
Your best bet is play D1 for the grimoire cards or look them up online. So much that's never used in there.
---
Literally happened to me last night
---
Don’t mind me just here to see how this ends
---
Congrats!
---
It's changes to the subreddit not the game...
---
Add /s for sarcasm. Hard to tell over the interweb
---
I was in the same boat, just got mine 5 hours ago, still need the ship. Hang in there.
---
You must be a warlock since only hunters have more "crutches" than titans! Did I get that right?
---
Maybe ;)
---
Ooooo, what does the catalyst do to this thing? And do you have a good link or can you explain what you need to do to get it?
---
Already did last word around 2 years ago, with its addendum ornament, so...
---
Taking out the envoys first weakens the primeval.  Allows it to take more damage.  They don't teach you that, but you will hear drifter say "primeval is compromised" when you kill one of them.
---
No?
---
Cool. Will do. 
---
Big chugus
---
They still haven't fixed the issues. In fact, their 'solutions' usually just create more problems. 
---
People complained about lack of variety when they had weapons come with set rolls. So they throw back random rolls...and make it so that 90% of the perks are still useless, so there is still no variety.
---
People complained that Exotics were too easy to come by in Vanilla D2. So instead they took us back to Vanilla D1 drop rates and then made it even worse by refusing to allow Xur to sell new stuff. 
---
And that's not even going into the shit they've done with PVP. 
---
Wonder what got deleted...
---
I have origin premier I've played a lot. 
---
Lol I've done that and the player I killed found me and tea bagged me. Made me laugh.
---
WTB Year one armor with perks.
---
I got my first engram as drop about a week after i finished forsaken. GWESIN VEST DAMNIT! 
---
Yikes dude, that's a bit harsh. You ok man? Wanna talk?
---
It took 2 or 3 days from when you complete the quest.
---
[This site](https://www.ishtar-collective.net/categories/book-truth-to-power) shows all the lore pages currently in game, but I don't think it's been updated for this week yet. 
---
Um ya, and they haven't released everything yet. 
---
I still suck at running to find an open door and as a result will never be allowed into Petra's attempts
---
Fair enough, I am starting to prefer SMG's as well,   in PvP and PvE
---
Dude... For real lmao. The slightest movement and Johnny just goes right past my enemies. Sometimes the tracking is on point tho.
---
Key word is "forgeD", meaning you forged/created/completed it.  This does not mean that it dropped randomly for you.
---
Always in that comp game mode i forget the name of
---
I am pretty sure you can manually request a code email from the Bungie site if you didn't get an email for some reason. Look for a "Bungie Rewards" page or something. 
---
This image has a distinct lack of Omnigul 
---
The game isn’t dying your just to salty to see that your wrong
---
What did he said?
---
?
---
Figures that I want some snow but noooooo, have to go all the way to the western part of the state for it. 
---
Oh well. 
---
Hail Petra! 
---
jottun sucks in crucible my fr with backup plan works way better and more consistent and getting kills
---
jottun is better for gambit then crucible
---
There is no reason as far as I am aware. 
---
Gg bro i finally got it to i needed the osprey for like 2 months
---
Are we using the same eververse? Mine definitely has perks
---
1. Level and power level is disabled in pvp.
---
2. That is a known issue they will theoretically address Soon^TM. I agree that it is bad and should not happen. 
---
I'm on pc :( I sadly let my psn expire. Sorry bud.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Fuck I’m just returning since release, when 270 was good. Am I so far behind now at level 20?
---
Oh yeah they have a perk or two while most armor pieces have 3-4 perks I think. I think I get blown away by the 10 defense number and typically low number of perks and just disregard them as garbage armor, wasting space in my vault. 
---
It's retroactive for the Redrix's Broadsword quest, but I don't think it is for other quests. 
---
u got good snipers g
---
Should post this on the Anthem subreddit 
---
Just buy forsaken..
---
My primary chest is a piece of eververse armor with 4 perks
---
Thats the theory that most everyone is going with
---
Overwatch player?
---
I did my grind for Luna’s once I got OEM, it was a easy fuckin grind with that OP exotic. I just think it needs to be needed into the ground.
---
Looks like I gotta start turning in my gunsmith materials. Been giving them to Ada this whole time
---
Thanks, I'm not hip enough to know all the abbreviations.  Lolol
---
As a kid, that song scarred my imagination. 
---
(obvious reason)
---
As an adult. That drum beat starts and I start tapping the foot. Then I resist the urge to tuck my weener between my legs. 
---
Now I want riven as a pinup girl.
---
Thanks
---
🙌🏻
---
I get it now, thanks a bunch
---
I'm showing this to my kid. 
---
#I WAS CALLED HIP TODAY!! 
---
I see, I had heard it being called one of the pinnacle weapons for this season so I wasn't sure whether it would go or not when the season ends. Thanks though
---
Oh definitely, especially if you're properly team shooting.. it feels great when desperado is proc'd.
---
I just think you can put in more work consistently if you're using an adaptive or aggressive frame. So the grind to get either one of those frames feels more rewarding than the time/effort required for the Broadsword
---
I appreciate it guys.. I re-downloaded the game, got to the tower... and instantly deleted the game after that! Just not into it anymore.. can save my $20 for food or what not lol
---
I even got masterworked range.
---
There’s quite a few ways your argument falls flat, but I’m gonna go with the easy ones:
---
1) 1KV is an exotic heavy. The only time you’d feel it’s power in a PVP setting is when a heavy spawn pops up in Crucible, or an invader has it in Gambit...whereas Luna being a legendary can be used whenever, wherever, and outperforms even exotics themselves. Terrible comparison.
---
2) PVP is not Bungie’s priority. The fact that Trials is on the shelf for the foreseeable future is a testament to that. However, ongoing problems in Destiny have all stemmed from PVP. For them to have made an already imbalanced sandbox ever MORE imbalanced is plain stupid. Like I said, they can find other ways to reward skilled players.
---
Also your progress on the steps won’t be reset either let’s say you’re on the precision hand cannon kills step and you have 70/100 when the season ends when the next season starts you’ll still be at 70/100
---
as soon as I see [X ENEMY Loaded {ROCKET LAUNCHER} at X location]. I immediately dip from a group.
---
Never thought about Cerberus, probably better than the sweet business
---
We will likely be getting more info on her in Sept or Oct.
---
We have Jokers Wild, Then Penumbra. And then everyone is expecting The Taken Queen to kick off Year 3. And that is where we will learn of Eris Morns Fate. Whether that be dead, alive, or possibly the first taken guardian.
---
I saw mostly ARs in today's IB. Weird. 
---
Get tired of these "I'm better than everyone and my teammates are trash" posts. If dude wasn't such a tool he may have a few friends to play with and remedy his problem. 
---
Mine is my Side mouse button.
---
Nah I was just exaggerating. The charge is negligible tho for those that know how to use it. It’s just like other fusion weapons and bows. You charge, strafe away from cover and release. People get kills with jotunn until the opponents realize they have it. It’s still dirty on objectives like control tho.
---
I was going to rib you, but instead I'll go against my better judgement and actually comment. 
---
Right off the bat I'd say that reaction speed/aiming and map knowledge are skills. Skills that are developed through practice and repetition. So, those things would actually make you better at the game. 
---
Also, as a team-based mode of a multiplayer game, teamwork and coordination with communication are skillsets in and of themselves. This example rears it's head in solo queue especially. The lone wolf will most of the time be beaten by a communicating, coordinated fireteam. 
---
Right there you have four skills that are learned and practiced that set people above the rest. Even with the large margin of error that P2P provides. 
---
Thanks m8
---
So you are getting beat in pvp and decided to cry about it
---
You will just get the DLC's
---
I like you, definitely a better personality than the other mods on here. Thanks for being active 
---
You don't respond either, I'm still waiting 
---
Whats the spider bounty mean, arnt they there all the time??!??!
---
Lets break down all of your points. 
---
&gt; You do understand, that this game is a P2P game, and that no matter what  you do, aside from cheating and network manipulation, your results, in  the cruicible are solely based on randomness. Right? 
---
Completely untrue. I rarely have connection problems with this game. Most people have minimal, if any, connection problems. Your ping probably just sucks and youre butthurt about it.
---
&gt; here's reaction time and aiming, we got it and most people understand  this, you're not a special snnowflake, but in the end, if the game wont  register/count your shots vs the individual you're facing, It doesn't  matter what you do. 
---
Also complete bullshit. Once again, your ping likely just sucks, and thats on you, not the community.
---
&gt; My point in all this rambling, is, you're not that good, your success is  based largely on who you are matched with, and then how shitty your  connection is to the host. Im tired of going 30 KD/A games in Control,  with 5+ captures, only to lose cause my team is ass 
---
Getting paired with a shitty team is a problem that plagues every team based PVP game to ever exist. Stop whining about it.
---
&gt; or more importantly, there's the one guy on the other team you cant  kill, or, no one can kill, cause shots don't register, or, your shotgun  blast disappears into thin air, I.E., all of the above. 
---
Once again, sounds like a you problem and youre just projecting on everyone else. Shotguns have short range and aiming with them can be difficult until you get better at it over time.
---
&gt; There's no one, in this game that ive played against thqat I thought,m  wow that dude is legions above the rest skill-wise, because reality, it  boils down to connection to the host in a P2P system. 
---
Literally this entire post is you rambling about how shit your connection is, but no, its bungo's fault "muh p2p, muh shitty team pairing" Just get better at the game dude, and get a better internet connection if youre struggling with playing pvp. This game is incredibly skill based and what loadout you choose and how you choose to use it makes a huge impact on your success.
---
Yes he is
---
Alright stream whatever it is that happens haha
---
Would love to, he won't even respond though. What a joke
---
&gt;PSA: To the people who think they're actually good at this game... You do understand, that this game is a P2P game, and that no matter what you do, aside from cheating and network manipulation, your results, in the cruicible are solely based on randomness. Right? 
---
Wait for it.
---
&gt;Im tired of going 30 KD/A games in Control, with 5+ captures, only to lose cause my team is ass, or more importantly, there's the one guy on the other team you cant kill, or, no one can kill, cause shots don't register, or, your shotgun blast disappears into thin air...
---
30 kda? Proof please. Also,  you just said it was random and not your skill, so be thankful that you get paired up against as many afk people as you do.
---
&gt;I mean, yes, there's a certain level of map knowledge you must know. There's reaction time and aiming, 
---
Both definitely things that are all random and have nothing to do with skill
---
&gt;...but in the end, if the game wont register/count your shots vs the individual you're facing
---
It's probably you that had a shirt connection then, have you tried turning your router off then back on?
---
&gt;...the game will match you with sub par players...
---
Errm, now comment.
---
&gt;You don't know until you're 3-5 minutes into match what you're working with, in regards to teammates, but you find out eventually. 
---
Yeah, that's how match making works, duh
---
&gt;...you're not that good, your success is based largely on who you are matched with, and then how shitty your connection is to the host. 
---
Right? Cuz accuracy, confidence with load out, map awareness, super selection, super timing, and knowing how to defend heavy are not skill based.
---
&gt;I seriously urge, anyone, to prove me wrong. Legit. I don't think its possible.
---
Burden of proof is on the individual making the claim
---
Are you dodging near enemies? The dodge perk only works when you are in close proximity to enemies. Use the Spathe all the time, always works for me. 
---
Well said
---
Sometimes I’m thankful it doesn’t so I can pretend my contribution to the dps was integral and I didn’t miss all those whisper shots.
---
