I have been doing that. Does gambit count?
---
---
---
I actually do, because I like Polaris Lance but use Thunderlord.
---
Nerf the duration, that's it.
---
Yellow bars will be there?
---
I made a hunter alt recently and my least favorite thing so far is when I throw my knife on top tree golden gun and my fireteam member kills the guy like a split second before it hits
---
Took me a second on that one haha
---
That’s cool. I tried it a bit after first getting it but other than novelty factor I couldn’t find a reason to take it over Thunderlord, Whisper, Sleeper, etc but that clip looked awesome.
---
They're better than they were, but still outclassed by basically everything. I know Bungie says the range advantage necessitates a damage disadvantage, but this is ludicrous. I can kill an enemy faster and from farther away with ONLY BODY SHOTS with a Go Figure than I can with the Jade Rabbit.
---
And? Listing a prime example in my favor is supposed to support your point somehow?
---

---
every mmo has used toon as a term. get over it.
---
You sweet soul, those links are invaluable. Your kindness has blessed me on this day, can’t thank you enough buddy!
---
Must be because I am actually autistic but I don't get how this makes any sense. 
---
You should just use the best hand cannon, Telesto, and you would mow through these guys...
---
Thanks for sharing anyway, will do!
---
I recently got mines a tad later than most people but I remember the grind all to well. Congrats and enjoy it! You endured and your reward is a literal red beam of death laser gun. 
---
If you use a bow or hand cannon and cant hit these youre just bad
---
Revolvers held 8 rounds sometimes. 
---
Yeah it’s the Future Perfect Shell. I got it from the Etched Engrams

I’ve been trying to get either one of those exotics and I got them back to back. I can’t believe it
---
And the layout is the one from last year with the max light at the time.  Nice try 😜
---
Not going to touch the first part of your comment, pun maybe intended... but I waited for the right time and got all of the expansions up to Forsaken for $30 at Christmas. The annual pass however is another story.
---
What was in it?
---
Technically yes. In practice it feels like it doubles the length. Have you used one?
---
I had the season pass ffs they wanted more cash fml? No f this game more like
---
That just happens to be a coincidence. I could easily repost another picture if you all really don't believe me

Go for it

I bet my whole months wage that was Leroy Jenkins.

you know what i'm talking about because you refused to name the exact exotic and non exotic guns i'm talking about. don't play stupid you're better than that.
---
Well, we could probably agree on a "please help, i am doing the last word pvp step" sign for crucible quickplay. i´d gladly take a loss to help someone with a quest that is very frustrating to beat.  
---
So give me your suggestions please, or feel free to make this into your own post.

My favorite encounter in Last Wish. The timing of the music just makes that last phase absolutely epic.

Stop littering this subreddit with such shitposts.

meme police will arrest you  
---
Agree wholeheartedly. Now it’s mainly chaos reach with geo mags (which is admittedly really good) and dawnbreaker. 
---
They ramped up the package cost on seeds though, I've only managed to get 4-6 cores/6-8 mod components every 1200 session, if it's only cores you want, you can skip the time and straight buy the cores, but I like the trade off in weapon materials to either farm gunsmith or straight buy mods for either gunsmith or ada. Could be my own crappy rng though, and after a 1200 session I end up at about 850 so each session cost around 300 seeds? Wondering if that's normal?

I know I was playing some game i think it was the first destiny and some group was ddos attacking servers mainly effected PS but they got xbox atleast once that I recall. Also i think it messed with online play on most if not all games not just destiny

Shrink the ear and fix the left eyelid droop and its more than alright alright alright!
---
Jitter mods? 
---
I think the PvE nerf was too much but I also think it’s still viable in PvP, but I know that will be an unpopular opinion
---
Yep. Void Warp had been my principle super since Forsaken dropped (except during Blind Well when I used Well of Radiance with  lunafactions, because of course). About three days before 2.1.4, I finally got geo mags. It's as if bungie were saying "Yeah, you're gonna need these..."
---
Yessir 
---
Don’t listen to this dude, he’s salty for whatever reason and wants to be a shitbag... seriously, good job. Sleeper is a grind and you’ll love it. 
---
I got very lucky with a rare bounty. 
---
no kidding it took me so long before i figured that fucker out. at first i tried dodging the attack, then tried killing it with my ep shotgun, then i would shoot the arm with tlw until it staggered and i progressed, but what I didnt realize is that i just had to shoot one bullet and only when the enemy shot first. so i was wasting a whole mag trying to shoot before they aimed the weapon. then i looked it up on yt
---
Those first 4 words on 90 percent of posts in the past month lmao
---
You are doing my boi well
---
Look at Banshee-44 can’t barely remember the last time he pooped.
---
Thanks dude it’s great
---
I'm just saying if each class can point out several things the other two need to have nerfed, maybe the game isn't so poorly balanced after all. 
---
even if you didnt injure yourself, they were just uncomfortable and clunky.
---
The comparison is inappropriate. 
---
So the proto-hive were just regular hive, but without all those glowy magic tricks? 
---
I think large blockers should be buffed. They die a little too quickly and dont output as much damage and annoyance as smalls and meds.

---
there's about a minute from completion to final completion.  
---
  the fireteam did the work, completed the boss fight, and won, but failed to continue to the chest,where the rewards are given, and the credit is saved as a win.  
---
 so, as far as the game knows, they failed.   
---
all they had to do is stay connected for (about) a minute longer.  
---
&gt;I also recommend the following
---
* [https://www.light.gg/db/all/](https://www.light.gg/db/all/) \- search any weapon it will give you all possible rolls on the weapons and you can hover over the symbols to provide an explanation for each roll.
---
[https://db.destinytracker.com/d2/en/items/weapon?t=5](https://db.destinytracker.com/d2/en/items/weapon?t=5) \- gives you a break down of questions and activities in game.
---
But if someone else's favorite class got fucked it wouldnt be time for it? ;) 
---
Thanks for clearing that up, very insightful. As much as I hate being wrong I also appreciate being taught, especially about Destiny Lore so again thank you! 
---
Really just finished for first time? Its been out forever...
---
... eververse was bungies idea, and it only sells cosmetic items soooo why the truck load of salt?
---
Nightstalker has the highest KD/A by absolutely miles. Second is Sentinel. Both these subclasses are really strong. Both have comparable win rates. I don't see how the link disproves my argument. It's showing that Nightstalker is very, very strong and Sentinel is a close second.
---
Everything else you said is complete bullshit and proves you know nothing about PvP in Destiny. Dodge is the best class ability in PvP (lmao, it's actually funny that you think its useless).
---
Are you using a fire team medallion?
---
Well theres titan skating and oem that makes the experience easier
---
I literally played against one yesterday. Beat his ass tho.
---
Also it knocks targets back so half the time they don't even get hit by the explosion part. 
---
I'll  upload a few more as I continue flicking through the book. I hope you enjoy it as much as me.
---
helps to get a group and one shot nokris with 3 nighthawks or something
---
My team or myself could help you run it again we used to do it every week 
---
With fire team medallion, I've gotten a prime engram damn near every time by the third wave. With out it, only get blues
---
Punk
---
I’m stuck on this part of the quest, can’t solo and can’t find two others :(
---
Nah mate we have a 6 man clan so we good
---
Yes please 
---
Use your super on a phalanx
---
Well making everything the same level of bad isn’t going to help the game, look at what’s been happening with rainbow six for example
---
There isn't unfortunately.
---
oh i see, i play on console so once tethered my aim goes on a roller coaster ride.
---
Just keep going. After 20 runs you should be very close to getting it. 
---
True endgame milestone lol I'm at 39/40 myself. I know about the once a day braytech schematic but still can't get the sidearm to drop for me to get any motivation on doing the wanted bounties for the wayfarer title 
---
I literally have to tell you something important.
---
2 days ago me and 3 clan mates made up a strat that is unbeatable in gambit and only one hunter with tether and Orpheus rigs and three top tree voidlocs using that ahamkara helmet and. 
---
Once we got our super we would have Mr.Hunter tether all the enemies and one of us would use or nova bombs to kill ads which would spawn orbs for everybody and basically we would do this until we got the primevil. 
---
Then we would have Mr.Hunter tether the primeval and his spawns and proceed to use 1 nova bomb to take everything out which would make more orbs and then Mr.hunter would use tractor cannon to shoot the boss and EVERYONE WOULD USE NOVA BOMB which would literally melt the boss in .5 seconds and we would all have full super for the next round.
---
It was honestly amazing and we havent lost a singoe gambit match for 3 days now.
---
what, no. do you even have forsaken? you do know that the cost to purchase the cores doubles each time right? 60 cores should be &lt;4611686018427387904 legendary shards(if i did the math right)
---
That’s the Raid set. Imo the Forges set looks even better. You can also combine those two they fit nicely together. Also the shaders are both dope. 
---
Just wipe on the first run as soon as you can, and you won't return to orbit
---
Werent behind the wall homie
---
Why are the hot ones always crazy smh 😤
---
I like the spinning up perk, it melts after this update.
---
Since when is spawn camping against the rules? 
---
Destiny 2 minimum requirements.
---
[...] please use error code: bee.
---
Yeah, it’s pretty lovely. Can’t bring myself to dismantle the bow for a small chance of it dropping though...
---
A quality shitpost
---
Thats because 7 nightfalls at omce was likely a bug and was fixed 
---
I got the auto rifle curated and dismantled the second I saw the shader, I'm pretty sure it's guaranteed as a drop from dismantaling them 
---
It isn't against the rules, but it was something that has been frowned upon since the earliest FPS games. It gives the opponent an unfair advantage since they know exactly where opponent will be and not vice versa since you can essentially snipe from anywhere on the map. There are easy fixes for this on Bungie's end that don't punish either side and make the game more competitive. One fix that everyone else figured out is randomizing the spawn points for both sides.
---
It's literally Calus, bro..m
---
Thats normal and you keeo the CP lol
---
When I got my osprey a couple months ago, it took me 72 runs. 12 hours.

I'm not sure wether to applaud this alrighty shitpost or not.

No

Five chest? Are you talking about at the end? I thought you could only open 1.....
---
It’s actually pretty helpful in the LW raid after you run out of rockets on Riven.
---
Dismantled my curated bellowing giant for the burgusean night shader
---
Same on pc but I wasn't gonna let him take that zone
---
Care to provide a counterpoint? Just saying “no” isn’t gonna make me think you’re right
---
Useless 
---
He literally didn't get the banner, you get it upon opening the chest lo
---
The chest doesn't open unless you get down there iirc 
---
It’s at the very top, its kinda small though

Huh, it's almost like humor is subjective. Go fuck yourself.

---
Well Crucible is on P2P basis so lagging players will always happen. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I think just about anything has the chance of giving an exotic, it's just pretty small
---
oof
---
Hot tip you do not need the shaders for the badge triumph (or the exotic ship). It just unlocks when you have all weapons and emblems and armour etc 
---
The shader actually looks really good on it!
---
Imagine fighting this fireteam 3v3!
---
I do! On a daily basis to study. I play Destiny about 3 hours a day and mostly on weekends! Im just efficient with my time thank you. 
---
Oh its gona give me a potato gun 
---
When this meme gets re-posted more than 2 times 
---
For Wayfarer i had honestly done everything possible before Forsaken was a thing so that was super easy for me,  Cursebreaker is both RNG and all the eggs a and stuff,  Chronicler is the hardest to get! I remember doing my 100 weapons a month ago,  that was a craZy grind! You can do it man!

Nice. Stealing.

Iirc it’s a guaranteed drop. Says “dismantle an item with this shader to abstain”
---
Classic Titan.

Possibly a minigun power weapon with it being the only one made by Bungo.

Dat titan ass

Has he been looking at Osiris nudes again!?

Finish all the triumphs from the Blacksmith seal

Agree - we need a mechanic like in overwatch competetive, that allows you to leave after some else left without punishment and still gives a win to the other team. 
---
He’s just trying to listen man be quiet
---
All the crazy new shotguns out and I just can't let go of my Good Bone Structure. I just know the thing so well

Uh, No. They dont. Since the buff, its melting everything, and if you play it right, you get your entire super back. I see alot of people using it recently

Boy, do I have some news for you.

Fuck you and your cursbreaker... I just need the ship. A ship I'll never use

No, map sizes amd spawn locations were and still are broken. There are still supers that can kill on one side of the map then the other. The fix was lazy.

You'll get it!

RIP, my child

Neat! Could have sworn I saw a post here that said you needed all the shaders too, but I’m too lazy to go find it now.

😤😤

If it was Activision incarnate the stuff would be p2w, nothing wrong with the current ever verse cosmetic model and how generous they are with bright engrams and eververse loot.

It’s always been time for it. Bungie’s obsession with balancing the game as a whole has fucked the balancing since day one

Just get it from the collections...

Also why scrap it? Didnt catch that part

Agreed!!!

Holy fucking thank you. Every other word on this sub is "Nerf", we need more of this mentality

I feel you man. Did five for each character thinking it would drop if I switched it up so far everyone I’ve done it with has that damn rocket launcher except me really getting irritated by this

Yep, that's what I'm using 
---
You're right. But that doesn't change the fact the she is basically non-existent in terms of story and lore.

I wanna earn it so I can trash it agsin because I got so frustrated doing it in the first place. Hatred was my motive and spite is my drive.

Glad to see we are on the same page.

Less anger more depression and thoughts of suicide only stopped by putting it off another day by giving myself a reason to stay alive like grinding for something to make other people mad that I got the same thing they thought made them special.
---
The hardest part for me was beating Enkaar. 
---
The first time I did it I missed even though I was sure I hit him so I convinced myself that I needed 2 shots to take him down. 
---
So every time he spawned I shot him with 2x. That last round where you need to shoot 3 of them was damn near impossible! 
---
Wait, Rose, handcannon?  Oh for guckst sake bungie, another exotic he? 
---
Shoot teammates to heal them
---
What’re you cayde ?
---
PS4. You need help w something??? I’m always down for 100k NF and gambit, raids and shit

And then after fucking sitting through 3 loading screens it puts you through 2 more while watching your ship fly who tf stood up in the boardroom and was like they'll really like to see 5 loading screens its the new video gaming fad
---
So I just started playing Destiny2 two nights ago again (pretty much haven't played since launch)
---
Do I start doing the Forsaken questline? (yes i did the level 30 completion thing that I got from some upgrade
---
What LL are you??? Once you get to max/close to max light the forges become very very easy 
---
So fast, didn't give me a chance to add the comment. I want to move towards end game content.
---
Thank you.
---
Half of those blades in the warlocks back have been there since the start of D2 Lol. We belong in the trash yo. That's our DESTINY. 
---
Yes. Just finish the Forsaken quest as soon as possible.
---
I wanna go for it, but I'm stuck on the early step to get the achievement requiring like 10928731827498365 fast double kills, and it sounds like a PITA.
---
I suck with grenade launchers and don't want to butcher my KDA
---
Yeah, start the Forsaken missions. You have to complete that, then do a follow-up quest to unlock the final part of the map. 
---
640ish
---
no drop mag so u gon suffer
---
Idk, they arent horrible but they’re pretty damn annoying. For some reason it’s not bad when stuff like scouts or pulses rule the meta, but when it’s shotguns or even hand cannons, it’s just annoying. Maybe the difference is the enemy has to get kinda close so it just feels disrespectful compared to the other gun types.
---
Now machine gun... god what a fuckin terrible heavy weapon meta. So annoying.
---
Not anything really i just wish i had people to do the steps with make it a bit easier, so far done everything solo and im about to finish izanami forge
---
Just want to tell you that since I read this message I've been rallying every single flag I run past. It was a great tip!
---
Well I get that but what’s your playstyle
---
yes, its awesome for pve. It's my go-to roll for hc in PvE. I also have the ultimate god roll which is drop mag kill clip rampage but i prefer the outlaw rampage one.
---
My dude comes through with a fun post and all everyone says is how he's a week late smh 
---
His makeshift realm from which he takes the taken enemies and his 'unique' taken bosses
---
Like how do you want to play aggressive, tactical or support
---
This is your brain on acid.
---
Day one D1 warlock here,
---
WARNING rant to follow,
---
I couldn't agree more, bungie wouldn't know balance  if it fell from the sky and smacked them in the face. All they had to do was Nerf the range on NW but NOOO They Nerf damage, duration, charge speed engery usage and in super movement speed. They they have the balls to call it a slight change??? lololol and the so called stormtrance "buff"?? Don't make me laugh, one extra chain???? Stormtrance has been in a sorry state since the nerfed it around the time of taken king. It needs a damage buff, faster in super speed (when a guardian can out run your super in the crucible what's the point) and it shouldn't take as much energy for iconic blink. 
---
Hunters have been OP in crucible since D2 dropped and now Titans with OEM ( which I can't believe is even in the game... Member getting an overshield with a sunsinger melee and every body was crying over it?? At least it had a cool down and it didnt give a damage buff lolol) and 1 hit shoulder charge are right there with them. When NV dropped it was the first time I felt the classes in the crucible were somewhat balanced ( even if the blast range of NW was a bit much, it needed a range Nerf). Now they nerfed it straight into the ground. 
---
Do they even play test this shit before they release it??  
---
I mainly use hunter or titan in PvP. I got my Luna’s on my warlock using bottom tree void nova. 
---
I can get multiple kills guaranteed with my Slovabomb and its way safer to use, and I get it back way faster. Nova Warp got ravaged in every way.
---
True but don’t forget bungie separated from activision recently so it’s bound to get better and they’ll start listening to us again 
---
As spectral blades and Striker pummel entire teams with impunity.
---
The only things that you will find it tough to get someone to do right now is the original raids (Leviathan, Eater of Worlds, and Spire of Stars).  Everthing else is still very active.  Even with those, if you are in a clan or post an LFG you can probably get someone to sherpa a group through, or a group to carry a newbie though.  This community is usually pretty good about helping out.
---
As far as catching up goes, it really won't take you that long to "catch up" I restarted my titan a couple of weeks ago.  I have 27 hrs in so far.  I have completed the base-warmind campaigns, the orange and blue missions on Nessus, Titan, and IO, and unlocked crucible (so 2 quickplay and 2 comp matches).  I am a lvl 50.  My light doesn't really count since I was able to bring in 600 light guns when I hit lvl 20 and 650 light everything when I hit 50.  I expect the Forsaken stuff to take ma another 6 hours or so to complete plus a few more hours to clear orange and blue missions on Earth &amp; Mercury.
---
Biggest worries are XP to get to 50 and light lvls, not necessarily good gear perks.  For the XP just use a fireteam medallion every time you play.  It will increase XP and loot, so its a win/win.  Playing through the story, orange, &amp; blue missions will get you the XP.  No need for extra grinding there.  For light, make sure you are doing all the milestones everyweek for power gear.  
---
As for gear, there are meta weapons in the game that you should have and keep.  Some of them are Go Figure (random drop), Curated Bad Omens (gambit resets), Whisper of the Worm (IO special mission), Sleeper Simulant (Mars Quest), and Ikelos Shotgun (Mars EP lvl 7 boss). The right perks on weapons can make a big difference, but perks on armor are not as necessary (useful and nice to have, but not necessary).  
---
Look at every Y2 piece that drops (Forsaken or Armory symbol on the item's icon). You need to look at stats and perks for armor.  You want to have a minimum of 3 for Resilience and Recovery, perferably 5 in each.  Mobility armor does not really help and is pretty mehhh for game play of any style (increases walking speed (not running speed), straffing, and jump height (minimal)).  If it has good Resilience and/or Recovery, but crap perks (you never use a bow, but it has bow targeting, and arrow scavaging as perks) you are gonna want to wear it over one with high mobility and great perks.  It will be very hard to get a good looking set that has all the stats and perks you want. 
---
Be cautious when infusing items.  Infusing is expensive.  Like to Like, do as much as you want (no cores needed).  So Go Figure into Go Figure.  If you are not going like to like, then make sure it is a god roll piece going up by at least 8 light or to max light. Also, higher exotics are not necessarily better.  If you highest heavy weapon is a Sleeper and you get a high light Sweet Business that is now your highest primary, you may want to infuse that new Sweet Business into your Go Figure.  One it will be more useful, and two, it will actually increase your max light, cause you can't equip both the Sweet Business and the Sleeper at the same time.
---
Nah...instead of threat detector you’re looking for kill Clip or rampage. Rampage is better for PvE and kill Clip is better for crucible, but even that comes down to preference. Zen Moment is decent, but there’s better. Try to get one with at least rampage and start from there.
---
Alrighty thanks
---
I have to admit, the almighty would be a pretty cool thing if we could somehow swing into Earth's orbit. It'd be a pretty good staging base.  I don't see any reason to keep it in the orbit around the sun if it's just going to be completely empty of cabal after we absolutely wiped them out. Maybe we should petition bungee to find some way to pull it into our orbit. I really think that we could find some good use into it.

I mean, he did add in the accent over the O, so you kinda have to do it.
---
Jus some advice don’t wear that mate it’s instant roast material, you gotta at least have 10 before you can flex it.
---
fuck it, i'd AFK in it.
---
Acrius Catalyst &gt; Prestige Leviathan
---
Sleeper Catalyst &gt; Prestige Spire of the Stars
---
Telesto Catalyst &gt; Prestige Eater of Worlds
---
They're all pre-forsaken legacy raids. You can't do "prestige" mode, without first having completed normal mode at least once on that character at some point in time.
---
To make matters worse, the Catalyst is a chance % drop. It's not guaranteed.
---
They scale you down to the raid's power level. So even if you're 650, you'll get scaled down damage wise.
---
Additionally, prestige mode for leviathan has slightly different mechanics. 
---
Prestige for eater of worlds and SOS require you to equip certain loadouts that changes weekly. Additionally, there's an extra handicap.. like prism, where every 30 seconds a certain element will do more damage than other elements... or the handicap that prevents any ammo drops, etc.
---
Not the easiest, but not too difficult. I think the most difficult one to find a group for, would be prestige Spire of the Stars. That shit is difficult enough on normal mode. Let alone prestige.
---
that movie is terrible, simply terrible.  Avoid it, if you havent watched it already
---
Okay mavericks, ready to see what you are fighting today ?
---
That's range finder not threat detector
---
Thanks, another thing
---
Besides forsaken I need something else right now? 
---
It's all preference, but here are mine;
---
PvP Go Figure - High Cal, Zen Moment, Kill Clip
---
PvE Go Figure - Armor Piercing, Zen Moment, Kill Clip
---
PvE Go Figure - Armor Piercing, Outlaw, Rampage
---
25 light under is nuts. You would do practically no damage to anything.
---
That would be an excellent way to continue to make the forges relevant in the future, *and* to give people more incentive to get the annual pass.
---
Not to mention I would value any excuse to do meaningful things in the forge that I can get.
---
I like the last one, it sounds like you tear through ads like a hot knife through butter.
---
Play through forsaken first and when you hit lightlevel ~610 you can decide on getting the annual pass
---
Annual pass. But that's only for black armory and soon season of the drifter. Level 601-650 is available to everyone with forsaken 
---
Don’t look at curated rolls as god rolls. I don’t think that was ever their intention. They are called “curated” for a reason. 
---
The intent appears to be to create a roll that captures the essence of a weapon, the static roll that would appear if this weapon was in Year 1. 
---
This gun is supposed to be about powerful double-barreled shots into enemy faces. This roll feeds into that flavor. Is it the most powerful roll? No but it is the most “Warden’s Lawiest.”
---
That thing shreds enemies. It's a good pairing with Bygones in Crucible too.
---
Indeed. Armor Piercing + Reload Reduction + Damage Increase is pretty much good in nearly all PVE situations. It's definitely my favorite. Rampage Spec makes Rampage even more appealing too. It's even better when you can get all of that on a Machine Gun &gt;:) My Hammerhead is disgusting.
---
Sooo cool
---
Check the second comment. And people wouldn’t use it anyway, for PvE at least. 
---
We have thunderlords and 1000 voices. This would be the only primary exotic to be able to compete with those.
---
Lol, i appreciate yall letting me know. Thankfully I havent gotten hatemail but I feel like I could solve that just by equipped my OEM. Either way, it doesnt phase me much. Ive gotten plenty of hate in other games with less to no way of tracking achievements for having a lucky game. I think hatemail for anything in QP is just sad on the senders part really. I dont even run meta gear or touch comp just cuz I expect some kinda grief if im not super sweaty
---
&gt;there are way more of us to find bugs than there are of them
---
I guess I'm just not as willing as you to give them a pass on their shoddy testing, which has a long history of being extremely sub-par.  It affects the seal/title, it should have been addressed WAY sooner.
---
Go play d1? Instead of crying on reddit 
---
damn straight
---
When you see the other team has a blade barrage ready and you see a hunter jumping 20 feet in the air, wtf do you think he's about to do? 
---
I’ve always wondered the same!
---
excuse you house of wolves cloak
---
It counters shotguns you best fucking B E L I E V E I’m using it
---
I wouldn't worry about it; there will always be "bad" players in Crucible. Just stick with your time and try to be a decent sport, and you'll still be better than a lot of them.
---
And if you're referencing TLW, you don't even need to get kills to advance through that quest, so just stay behind teammates, assist their kills, and you'll be okay.
---
Above all though, it's just a game; if you're not screwing someone's flawless run through Trials or something, you shouldn't be getting hatred directed your way, so don't feel bad.
---
I'm with you I think the tracking sets this thing way over the top
---
I agree 100%. I got rolls on my Blast Furnace and Kindled Orchid that IMO are better than the curated drops. I want the curated Ringing Nail though... I’m going to farm it this week and we’ll see if I get a curated roll which I believe is Dragonfly/Rampage with a Stability MW. 
---
You’re tier 9 
---
By that logic shouldn’t “outlaw” be a perk a Warden can never have? 
---
has no house
---
he kneels before no banner, owes allegiance to no kell
---
he is a **murderer,** and very good at what he does
---
Nah cause the warden has his own set of laws. Disobeying all others..
---
I wouldn’t go that far but I haven’t gotten to the point that I am looking to complete my collection yet.  
---
going on the ikelos shotgun grind today fellas
---
Meanwhile lots of people try to get the cosmetics for cursebreaker 
---
But that would make him an outlaw...wait.. wait a minute! Wait just a minute!! This is starting to add up!!
---
I went MB and PotG only with either Trust or Luna. The hand cannon was helpful for survivability on the off chance I didn't OHK someone. This way the Calculated Trajectory medals come easier.
---
The biggest pain is the double plays. Here tether was helpful (kill one tethered enemy and all in the tether count as a GL kill) and hoped to get Control a lot during QP. Spam a Zone with heavy for easy double plays since Guardians rarely capture solo.
---
Good luck Guardian!
---
🤯 we’re ahead of bungie 
---
r/destiny2 Has become the sub where PVP Hunters come to cry
---
Ego the living planet style?
---
I don't know I've found some pretty hot shaders in my road to 625 light 
---
my logic it, its not so much from a developers lack of budget but that THe Darkness itself is just beyound those doors. And that our Ghost, when given a mission is able to plot the most logical route into the area for maximum support. That being said, I had the most chilling Thalassophobia episode since replaying D2 when we meet The Hive again
---
Lmao they took nova warp powers and gave them to titan bottom tree striker 
---
Iron banana cloaks have been nice 
---
Cool, I respect your disagreement; although that's my point; It's simply not as great as Dawnblade. Like I said, it's OK or GOOD in pvp(pve though, they're both pretty spectacular now); but not Great or even our Best option compared to Dawnblade currently. We had Dawnblade or Nova Warp as great options(admittedly Nova was too strong, and needed slight tweaking but not the gutting bungo performed; just delete the fucking branch please), but now it's really just Dawnblade or gtfo. It sucks not having good alternatives. I really enjoyed swapping between Dawnblade or Nova depending on the map. :(
---
I agree Blink is great, but Blink doesn't net kills either. Comparing it to a Super is 100% incorrect. There are also plenty of people that are well adapted to killing 'Blinkers' mid-stride or after. You can't do anything during Blink anyways. After a handful of exposures, it's quite predictable. A better example of a boost to neutral game, would be Handheld Supernova, or just an exotic item like One Eyed Mask. 
---
+ Shards of gallanor
---
Hopefully I'll get the osprey too. 
---
I'm missing the RL for Wayfarer and the ghost for Cursebreaker (already did the ascendant challenge 3 times this week but this mf won't drop for me).
---
Enjoy your new title guardian!
---
You edited that don't be dishonest
---
General rule of thumb is:
---
Warlocks go heavy on Recovery
---
Titans go heavy on resilience
---
Hunters on mobility
---
Taking you warlock as an example: 
---
try to get recover 7+
---
Resilience some around 5+
---
Mobility 0-2
---
You need to combine the right armor pieces with mods to get what you want 
---
I have a hunter main and play it with:
---
8 mobility
---
6 resilience
---
3 recovery
---
Rally Barricade is particularly useful if you are using Autos, as it will keep reloading your clip until the barrier runs out - pair this with something like Sweet Business or Ether Doctor ( or anything else with rapid fire ) and Armentarium chest armour - lots of damage !!! 
---
Towering Barricade is handy for defense, but bear in mind that enemies take damage if they go through it, so use it on choke points / narrow areas and you've bought yourself a reprieve. 
---
The only reason OEM is a problem is because of Titan skating. The two synergize perfectly. You can easily chase down marked targets. Without skating OEM is fine.
---
Those shitty exotics should just be perks on legendaries but then bungie would have to do some fucking work for once
---
Can’t put mods on it though, so it’s a bit worse
---
 I didnt know about the nerf until last night, even in pve its shit. i was using it in one of the forges and I said "wow this feels so much shorter than normal", then i saw the nerf. rip
---
Fuck these posts, my fucking god! There is one of these shit posts every fucking day. We get it!
---
That definitely wouldn't mean everything would be meta, that's horribly misplaced to say.
---
It’s what the other guy said. If a prime engram will roll as an exotic, it drops on the ground as an exotic engram and not as a prime. Once you have it as a prime engram, it won’t ever turn exotic. 
---
People figured this out as primes have a certain threshold in enemy kills (plus or minus) for how often they drop. People that have kept track essentially know roughly when to expect a prime and, on occasion, an exotic engram will drop in place of the prime and they won’t get another prime until the next time one would be anticipated (ie the exotic replaced the prime engram). 
---
That and, back when prime attunement was stingier, exotic engram drops would consume the prime attunement buff. I haven’t seen that buff disappear for me in quite some time though. 
---
[I like mine too](https://imgur.com/a/EzJwui3)
---
Everything about D1 was better than D2, except for the whole mantle thing.
---
&gt;but each day you don’t use it it stacks
---
i play everyday and i get 2-4 prime engrams  everyday. so yeah, this is false. 
---
Because bungie will be able to sell it easier probably. Everyone would love to have both thorn and the rose. Infinite forest maybe? The perfect paradox shouldn’t exist 
---
Just need that damn sidearm from sleeper node. damn fucking shit wont drop. combining over 500 stems and over 20 weapon schematics later. fml
---
Floating purple eye has been done many times before
---
idk i just think that if everyone had access to something as good/obnoxious as oem i would hate crucible, dunno about others
---
You could of been less of an asshole.
---
/shrug
---
Just a bright engram. Probably get some lvl10 boots with crappy perks
---
Basically a flaming Fists of Havoc.
---
Say what you think in a way you can, man. Situation is not going to change if we're not going to talk about it.
---
really cool
---
Maybe its just that they were hyped up for me when i didnt have them, but i always thought they were insanely good after read8ng the reddit posts.
---
Yeah I hear you I just use mine as a little bump in health if I get into a firefight and almost died
---
*Laughs in nerf*
---
r/woooosh
---
The Whisper singes don't match the strike singes, because that would just make too much sense! This week, Whisper is solar singe. 
---
Neither should they be so different to a point where they can be considered their own weapon types.
---
Very Impressive!
---
Why lol it's like 10 games of not being completely incompetent in crucible. No excuse either when mayhem was last week
---
Prodigy or Tabgled Web. They're both D1 cloaks
---
Help me understand. If you mostly loosing in PvP or your score suck is it fun to play?
---
Template?
---
Technically it's the Syrian Soaker if you go English with both words.
---
what an original idea posted on reddit thank you so much
---
Better than Dust Rock Blues?
---
it has less range and impact...
---
Aachen is my favorite sniper too. Looks like longbow synthesis.
---
I bet you do
---
Have an upvote for the Baby Cakes song guardian!
---
If you die to me with OEM Shield active you are trash and clearly need the crutch.
---
Every part of the exotic is broken. Full heal is too much, overshield is too much and it's a mega overshield, tracking persists through death AND a damage bonus. Like how did this get through balance with all or even any of that.
---
This guy gets it
---
i feel your pain, its like it just refuses to drop :(
---
Braytech Weapons about to make me **not live**
---
I used that to level up my Titan in PvP, glad I'm not alone when I think it's good
---
compared to nova warp, thats pretty much nothing though. bungie saw what they could adjust to make it more balanced and just decided to choose all of them to lower
---
That sliding taint shot was fucking icy! 
---
Titan gang for life 
---
Thanks lol, my shaders are Celestial Dome on everything  apart from the arms, which has the default crucible shader on.
---
I know your pain. I got my 1 k voices on the 53rd run. 
---
 I grinded for this before they gave up on fixing 4th times a charm. I do wish we would have gotten feeding frenzy instead of zen moment. 
---
I’m not familiar, where to get shader?
---
It was the very last exotic piece of armor I got for my Titan also.
---
What did it cost?
---
Dragonfly and rampage
---
I don't speak tseries you vietcong bastard
---
duuuuuuuude...
---
Agreed, it’s a lot of fun to use. Just change it for PVP
---
Howd all those fire knives get stuck in your face?
---
I have been doing that
---
I'd wait for one with rampade and outlaw
---
THAT SENTENCE HAD TOMANY SYLLABLES!!!!! APOLOGIZE!!!!!
---
It took me far too long to realize what was healing this guy. We started at round 6 like 5 times and could never figure out why his health kept jumping up so much. I am not a smart man.
---
Just recently got back into comp decided I was going to finally start slowly grinding for Luna's howl and not forgotten the wardcliff is definitely one constant I've noticed very rarely see it used in any other types of Crucible matches or Gambit
---
Then you get back into skill level. Just because you can't win an unfair gunfight doesnt mean an exotic should be nerfed. It's actually easier compared to something like shutting down a super. None of the hunters on here had a problem with shard/BB combo. Even though that can team wipe and recharge super energy. Not even mentioning mayhem. 
---
Personally i enjoy Chaos Reach warlock for anything PvE that has a boss (or multiple bosses) somewhere inside. I also enjoy melting (top solar tree) titan both in solo and group activities, i even equip tractor canon for full support, also sometimes i go arc cause super is kind of infinite if you have enough enemies to kill. But when it comes to hunter, very usable in PvE with nighthawk head (one big golden gun shot) for both solo and group activities, barrage with shards of galanor when there are a big group of enemies, and also very usable in group activities with tether and orpheus rig equipped
---
Because you never see them. They look fresh. 
---
Well rested is just an xp buff, the facet comes from a special bounty from tess that you can only get once a week 
---
noooooooioooo... I feel that pain..
---
Titan is Definitely the meta
---
How much you wanna bet hes a blade barrage user 
---
You can only get prismatic facets from doing the tess evercerse challenge
---
Hmmmmm idk man you’re probably right tbh I have this color blind option on idk if that effects what I see or not. Oh well
---
GAH ME TOO. THERE IS NOW A WHOLE IN MY WALL OHGOD OH FRICK
---
I noticed this too like i had multiple frames just gone after mere hours and i come back and poof gone like wtf
---
If you run blind well enough, a well version of that emblem will drop along with the normal version. don't know where to get the base version alone tho.
---
Same thing happened to me. I lost the sniper frame after unlocking the second forge. 
---
I’m dying reading the title and it’s not even that funny but still... GAURDIANS REGAURING
---
Damn ya got me 
---
Halfdan is my favourite
---
I got it from an instructable then resliced it and added better supports. 
---
Have you tried the Botheration MK.28?
---
I've heard dark rumors that the energy version can be aquired from some Y1 sources, like the church lost sector in the EDZ, but i've never seen it.
---
They just nerfed the unbalanced super/exotic combos that Hunters had. Unless you're playing a Nova Warp Warlock (which was heavily nerfed at the same time), it's just a string of better players you're going up against.
---
They boost the range which is its only drawback
---
Shh. They're sensitive.
---
It is a God tier shit post 
---
Perfect, thank you. I just realized I was reading a thread from destiny warmind. I’m dumb.
---
Haha, I just noticed that
---
Really I must of missed it 
---
I don’t know about you, but it sometimes doesn’t let me leave at the matchmaking screen, it will just force me back into another encounter.
---
Also, if you get the "Maximum Temper" buff by shooting the two shield drones that spawn at the start of wave 2, you have 30 seconds to leave at the end instead of around 10! Also, it's a nice thing to do in case anyone in your team has not yet gotten the key from that forge. 
---
The frames now turn back into a ballistics log or modulus reports at the weekly reset. There are a few other changes, too, which you can find in this week's patch notes. 
---
you lucky bastard
---
It’s a known bug. They’ve been aware of it for a while and are trying to fix it. You can find the official post on their forums. Don’t worry though, you couldn’t progress those frames anyway because there’s also a bug that won’t drop items from the enemies you have to kill for those frames anyway. The 2 bugs are most likely linked.
---
“And other complaints heard twenty times a day! Today at noon.”
---
Nah mate it's common knowledge that Master Chief is a guardian, Cortana is golden age AI
---
If i hit my leave button any harder ill break my controller. Its not responsive 90% of the time for me. Probably the same for people who leave during the forge
---
Is it viable without the catalyst?
---
I've tried it on PVE and the rockets kinda go haywire.
---
r/wellthatsucks 
---
5 feet? I think he'll be ok. :'(
---
maybe that includes the next rotations?
---
I’d say join in whenever you’d like. Honestly, Bungie does a really good job of making it to where there is always a reason to come back to things in Destiny. Escalation Protocol is a great example of this. Regardless, you’ll probably always have people to do the annual pass stuff with whether you wait, or go in on it now.
---
This.  There will be future balance changes that shuffle up which subclasses end up being 'meta', but I can't remember a better balance for weapons...  Especially with this much variety.
---
and BB/shards have been nerfed multiple times, I'm seeing a problem here
---
I could use some help. 610 Hunter but just started playing only about 2 months ago. Need to do some NF 100K and raids/forges. 
---
PSN: aroc925
---
Thanks in advance! 
---
It’s a possibility, only probable one I would think.
---
huter masterrace for life
---
I need help in comp tbh.. I’m at brave 3, and it’s so hard... all these damn try hard just keep 4 stacking me. Wtf... lol 
---
Ringing nail w/ dragon fly and rampage.
---
You ever see a meme that's just really well made? Well that's this meme
---
Good shit OP
---
But us warlocks can punch people that far away
---
Your warlock looks so fire my man
---
Also I’m using a Lenovo yoga laptop so it runs at like 20fps but eh I don’t know if I should get it or not
---
Fucking wimpy ass hunters, get good scrubs! 😤 lol 
---
I like it. 
---
It's oddly creepy for some reason, but I like it. 
---
Hiding in the secrets of the shadow guardian, You will have to find it there. 
---
It’s certainly viable. The catalyst just makes it even better.
---
Yeah it's starting to get really annoying getting 8 misfits a week and then when you finally get an exotic, it's a duplicate. 
---
I too get a sore back from carrying teams /s
---
She gave me the best loot for my Chocolate Ship Cookies though &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
---
Damn 4 stacking try hards... i swear sometimes people like that just troll on those of us who don’t have Luna’s howl or not forgotten just to make sure we don’t get it, 
---
Oh god oh fuck it's the police
---
I don’t have NF, but I personally prefer countdown and survival over clash and control. Personal preference I guess.
---
Thanks! Man is the correct pronoun.
---
Is the ward cliff coil that good?
---
I did it without using my super, you just need to aim it right
---
Yes. I’ve been farming the cosmetics for 11 weeks now and none have dropped 
---
It basically works like a pocket blade barrage.
---
Probably increases bullet magnetism and aim assist 
---
Hunter scum
---
?
---
Ty guys
---
Spelling mistake. Titan story checks out.
---
The Titan meta especially if we're talking about PvP is solely because of how strong OEM is.
---
That and shoulder charging,
---
Apart from that in PvP since they destroyed nova warp I'd say personally it's a tie between slowva bomb, BB and six shooter GG
---
Just like most of this sub.
---
The cursed thralls are healing him
---
Haven’t done so for a while so I don’t know what is helping him.
---
Id really like to see it ! If what you say is true, i genuinely dont know how they made it. There is no known way to get the Truth to power lore book  to this day.
---
Man this brings me back to the days of TTK.
---
If only your opponents weren’t mismatched and undermanned I might be impressed.
---
You have a .93 K/D and a 1.04 Ka/D...you have no right to tell anyone to "get gud".
---
Shit I’ll take you up on that. Friends and I need a Sherpa for SotP. Plus we cheese gambit with two lasers and a melting point!
---
Yesterday, I did 4000 shares.  Here is my breakdown.
---
ok but where’s his ghost
---
i think it looks like a ghost shell
---
We hate you cause you're like space bugs and cockroaches that jump in the air too much...
---
Thanks!
---
I almost bought more but figured with my luck id get dupes
---
No we’re definitely space ninjas
---
Not many people on this sub use smgs from what I see. It’s all about the meta. They would say it’s a good roll because of the kill clip/outlaw but personally I wouldn’t know because I use HCs and Pulse Rifles in PVE and Gambit mostly, sometimes huckleberry or riskrunner. But I would say if the feel of it works for you, use it. Looks like a good roll
---
It's unfair in crucible. I had a Titan outrun my dawnblade. Fucker moved faster than the flaming sword chasing him down. 
---
It's not about having interesting movement. It's about a blatant pvp advantage.
---
What is the community supposed to be discussing here, exactly
---
That’s okay, damage comes from the explosion now anyway!
---
Everything downloaded with base game. All you did with the code was unlock it
---
It is about interesting movement, the only solution to fast titans isn't slowing them down, we could speed everyone else up instead.
---
I’m confused, I thought Failsafe was a human ai for a human exploration ship
---
You start with less ammo but ammo pickups work for both 
---
okay thanks..wasnt sure if i was supposed to see a prompt to download it
---
Unlike a lot of exotics, stomps and coyote work in any loadout, so I really like them. As far as extra charges go, bottom tree solar hunter with spathe is my favorite. I can usually chain 3 or 4 before I roll, but with room for error I can reach double digits.
---
ok, thanks. literally all I was looking for
---
Use tether and colony in mayhem I got about 50% in 4 hours
---
Its a god weapon for gambit and helped me carry to dredgen
---
Nobody ever gets my "Lord Smoked Meats and Fishes" references. I LOVED Freakazoid 
---
Where can I get this 
---
Bones of Eao bitch! I live in the past
---
If you need someone to play with add me on PSN TheCaptainQwark.
---
Looks like a vex servitor somehow
---
So put a piece of cheese over it
---
Nope, as soon as your updates finish, you'll have access to everything. Good luck, Guardian!
---
Me too lol, I’ve spent years practicing being more relaxed when playing games because I used to lose the fun of them by taking them too seriously. 
---
if ya look up warlock skating on youtube someone will explain it better than I can haha 
---
Small brain plays
---
I'm fn dying 🤣🤣
---
Aachen LR2 is still fantastic
---
True
---
Nice man!! Congrats! That’s a tough one right there!
---
Nice. I'm still 40% away from completing mine. I need the bosses from the Sniper and SMG week I think.
---
Rare bounty just will not drop for me :(
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE 
---
What helmet is that
---
nice
---
I give you my luck my dude!!! you got this!
---
Call your ISP and have them reprovision your router. 
---
Was he a scrawny wimp like an actual Hunter too?
---
Thanks man! I was going through my uncompleted Catalysts a few weeks ago and I had that "...oh no." moment when I remembered I never finished Worldline, haha. Fast forward to today, long cloak boy was finally the last boss I needed :D
---
This is where a hunter trap comes in lol
---
I've only been 50 for like 3 weeks what's going on in this? 
---
Oooohhhhh, sorry. 
---
Thank you! And yeah, I dislike that it's basically time-locked over 5 weeks minimum, but I guess it kinda makes it more satisfying when you finally finish it (:
---
Don’t have last word yet, haven’t felt like playing crucible. 
---
