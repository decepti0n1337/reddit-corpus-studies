Tbf if you’re running bottom tree striker and someone outplays when you’re in your super you deserve to get bagged. You had the world at your finger tips and it still wasn’t enough.
---
---
---
Now that is a rare moment
---
Congrats
---
*team rocket is fading away in the background*
---
I will be coming back for shadowkeep! Giving another shot for this game
---
Seems to coincide with 6 PM CST ( influx of US players)
---
I would be more surprised if they didn't spam joutunn. That what is hard to react to like blade barrage
---
I’m pretty sure this is your net man. Had this happen to me before and it’s usually just before my net drops.
---
Hey, I need the super meter full, so I can knee shit in the face and maintain that goddamn melting point up.
---
My net was fine, played for another couple of hours after this.
---
You cant fight when you're that tense guardian, what wrong with you? Relax.
---

---
Relax more!
---
**I SAID RELAX!**
---
\-shaxx
---
I now have fully committed to the reasoning that OEM is OP and deserves a nerf.
---
You could be into something, other than they would surely be playing on America servers and not EU?
---
So we back on the grind,
---
Cool
---
No, what you buy on steam is pre order only. You can only play through battle net if you already own D2 on battle net, or if you buy DLC on battle net.
---
Hand cannon exotic****
---
Good on ya! I genuinely despise when people do stuff like that.
---
yeah but it's good if used to shut down juggernaut titans
---
Not always, I have read some post about people going into EU servers to play. And your observation could be why they think they play better. They are just laggy.
---
No, they already got a price reduction, that's the current price that you see. The copy of the base game and year 1 DLC does not contribute to the price of the DLC pack. [More details about buying Forsaken here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/crvsyk/how_to_buy_forsaken/?)
---
Nope.
---
yeah but switching every weapon after every activity is so annoying
---
That’s not a thing
---
Lol if I need completions... And they don't need to be heroic.... This is definitely me.
---
Can not stand these people. I didnt have time to play with my hunter. So after all the grinding for solstice with my warlock and my titan  i drug out my  hunt and saw that i have an unfinished quest to do a heroic on tangled shore . Twenty seperate times i tried to do it every time some ass hat does nothing but focus on killing the boss before its heroic. Just one of the reasons i am tired of the toxic Destiny community.
---
Say it again for the ones in the back
---
There's something on the character selection screen I believe, like a small circle somewhere in a corner
---
Gonna fight you on this one, moebius quiver is not spammed and takes skill
---
Shoulder charging your team mates is the actual endgame content
---
Well, easy 10 points
---
Yes but he didnt
---
Are you using cross save?
---
I really wanted the armor, so as any person in the right human mind would do... I was determined to get the armor so I started the grind at 2pm on Monday, the event ended on Tuesday at 1pm. I wasn't gonna stay up for that long, cause that would be insane, right. So it was 3 in the morning at I was getting tired, but my friend and I pushed through the sleepiness and grinded till 6, and we were both to tired to finish the grind. It was upsetting until my friend had the bright idea of setting an alarm at 8, which would mean 2 hrs of sleep. Sure enough, we both woke up and finished the grind. We cut it close... We finished 10 mins before reset.
---
If you switched platforms and dont have the dlc for that platform you can only get items at max light of the base game.
---
Thank you!!! Imo that was the greatest feeling to start off a game, into an epic campaign. Sad that the game went to shit after that but my god did that memories screen make me feel special haha
---
Its hard for me because I never attempted to get a pinnacle. I was a quick play player before i decide to do this. I didn’t even know redrick’s claymore existed until the broadsword came out. I didn’t like the fact that people grinded for the claymore and they put out the broadsword for people who thought claymore was hard to get. I made it a point to get the recluse because I wanted that grind. I wanted to see how tough it is. I don’t want another exotic pinnacle weapon. 
---
As for the one eye, i just learned how powerful it is this season in competitive. That shit been sitting in my vault for months. The synthoceps were always my exotic armor of choice.
---
Yes
---
Looks like a quarian
---
Thank you! You can do it!
---
The spider never said his prices were fair, just that they were set
---
I do. Just being dramatic lol
---
Ohhh alright. Thank you
---
Redrix gang. Just finished the last few matches for mine. All I need to do is reset my valor one more time and finish tomorrow’s 5 bounties
---
How is it? Any mod recommendations?
---
I remember being the only one left on the team ;u;
---
No, many people feel the same way, including a pages long rant someone PM'd me, to my dismay (I'm just a random user, not affiliated with Bungie). 
---
It adds **a lot** of stuff to the game, basically an entire other game's worth, which is why it costs so much.
---
Good players could reach 10 kills ez with gwisin. Shards was nerfed alongside the other class super regen exotics. Spectral is still tough to kill after its defense adjustments, just like the rest of the supers. Titans have always had shoulder charge it's kinda been in the game for a sec. Half the time I get shotgunned out of it anyways. Hunters now have some pole dancer baton bash or some shit that I think can 1 hit. Warlocks now have supernova. If anything with the one hit melee it's been banalced by adding other similar abilities to the other two classes. One eyed mask is strong for sure, but what am I supposed to run if it gets nerfed into the ground? Titans have meme exotics don't even come at me with dunemarchers swear to got
---
Loaded question for pve. Its really great. 
---
Gunnora's axe is really good for pvp if you are accurate, Emperors courtesy is a bit more forgiving with the right rolls.
---
Same
---
Bottom tree striker lasts forever....several supers have high kill count potential. Golden gun, spectral, and pole dancer can whipe teams. Imagine how broken striker would be with the hit registration hunters have after their rework that sentinel Titan will never get and the range of spectral and pole dancer swipes
---
[removed]
---
I think this best titan armor !
---
This is caused by not owning Forsaken on the platform you are playing on.
---
&gt;Tbf if you're running bottom tree striker you deserve to be bagged
---
FTFY
---
No we were on burnout with this occurrence lol
---
This one hurts
---
Mirror Mirror I believe is the one you are talking about.
---
I've come to the realisation with mine and your clips that the slowva bomb is basically Destinys version of the red shell from Mario Kart... 
---
Also someone really needs to put the Benny Hill music to people trying to escape these! 😂
---
MoV isn't what I was talking about at all. The instant health regen and overshield is what makes it stupidly ridiculous. That, *and* they know your coordinates just because you made the mistake of damaging them. That's what's really bs about it.
---
Ah, a man of culture I see.
---
Feels good
---
What story mission?
---
My favorite is graviton lance
---
Yea scouts are not BAD but they are outclassed by pretty much everything and forget fighting a person with a pulse that can half aim.
---
Still they're not unusable.
---
Fun to blow people up with the Oxygen though.
---
I’d rather have the red death back
---
Should see what it’s like for guys like me that don’t have good teammates in their clan or whatever trying to get to legend, it’s ruff
---
Cause maybe tonight, I’ll find something other than 4 stacks again ( stacks again )
---
I grinded... It took me bouta hour to warm myself up to comp... Then it was up and down up and down
---
I am that guy on the shore because I want my etheric spirals and to get on with my day
---
It is the people with skill getting killed by a shotgun and or a one eye masked Titan (both require little to no skill)

And I have no skill at using the shotgun or one eyed mask

You should join a clan, after all it's why Hawthorne started this whole clan thing in the first place.

This had me dying... take my upvote my god...

I would pay actual silver for this to happen. When you are targeted by Nova bomb, some John Cena music fucking explodes in the background as the bomb gets closer...or if your targeted by the One Eyed Mask some fucking Silent Hill sirens go off....

---
Guess this is my punishment for not reading or doing research
---
At least I still got 2 other characters and the bounties are mega easy
---
If you think you’re done after three hours of forsaken then you’re definitely missing a lot. There are so many pursuits, triumphs, events... you’re telling me you’ve done every raid? Shattered Throne dungeon? You’ve completed zero hour and earned your outbreak perfected? You’ve forged all the black armory gear? You’ve discovered all of the weapons of sorrow? I don’t know what to tell you, man. Destiny isn’t Halo. In a lot of ways you set your own goals. But even with all that said, Bungie is releasing another huge expansion Oct 1st that by the looks of it will shake things up in a big way, so to accuse them of not creating content is just silly.
---
All good 😂 im so keen to see everyone do ittt

Damn that's a lot of messages. I turned my settings to "friends only" awhile ago and haven't looked back
---
Agreed 100%
---
Gonna try that first. Thanks
---
Well yeah i know there are certain weeks for each weapon but because this week is all weapons, can i endlessly grind it and get all of them?
---
Very carefully.
---
MEEEESTAAAA
---
Also, that deadline is September 17th.
---
Did the same thing with bracus zahn.
---
it would have been fun if it wasn't that still today, 90% of the times people just steamroll the boss.
---
i had to resort to search online and it becomes a race to activating the heroic mode before the others kill it.
---
Any eververse armor pieces you've collected will become ornaments, it should be immediately available for any armor 2.0
---
Lmao this is considered toxic now?
---
Also im not sure why you want stock up on any of those. The bright engrams wont yield anything new infact anything you get from them wont even turn into bright dust and the prime engrams wont give anything new and will be locked at 750 power
---
So were you there to ensure this is the case? Did you sit there and witness your entire AFK farm?
---
As someone else here already said, you could just do the quest for the chalice, then you'll be 690
---
The best choice for you to buy would be Forsaken: Complete Collection. This includes the Base game, the first 2 Expansions Curse of Osiris and Warmind as well as Forsaken and it's Annual Pass. 
---
While Forsaken is an Expansion of the game, the Annual Pass is mostly tied to seasons and was released over time. The Annual Pass is an addition to the endgame content of Forsaken. Right now, we are in the third Season in which the Forsaken: Annual Pass is active (first there was Season of the Forge, then Season of the Drifter and now we are in Season of Opulence) and that's the last season the Forsaken: Annual Pass will work for. All content from the Annual Pass is still available to play (apart from a few cutscenes I believe). 
---
I would recommend to try this Collection first before preordering Shadowkeep (the new expansion starting on October 1st) and its Annual Pass.
---
YOU SHALL NOT PASS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
EU or NA?
---
Awesome! I don’t know if I have a season pass but i bought everything up untill now. I,ll check it out tomorrow than.
---
Man if I knew this sooner, I’ve been hoping for so long to get some new exotic armor drops. And now I hear you can just buy them 😂

Literally until this post I thought it was a random chance thing for an event start as heroic or not. There is nothing ever as far as I can tell that has told me it can be made in to a heroic encounter.
---
As a new player i have no idea this was a thing, i killed a boss early and he said "learn your strikes" the. I just unlocked strikes and it seems to be a dungeon or something so now im e en more confused lol

Way too real

Unfortunately I think you could only get them from Saladin in year one. I thought they were going to offer them this season but doesn't look like it.

Shadowkeep doesnt release for almost 2 weeks yet

I just block with a sword for the whole fight so other guardians can kill him

There are some items that aren't required for the seal but appear there when you get them, iirc they are the ghost from Niobe  labs, the emblem from Niobe labs and the emblem from the obsidian generator

---
I remember for all of Y1 I ran Actium + Sweet Business. Good times.
---
I probably could have phrased it better by saying we went on to lose the game from the winning position
---
I personally think that's best to go ahead and run through all the campaign stuff first since there are some things that require progress to a certain point in the campaign.
---
After Red War, start the Curse of Osiris campaign and then Warmind Campaign. After you finish that, if you own Forsaken go ahead and get that done. By then you'll have learned a lot along the way and have a little bit of an idea about where to start with endgame content.
---
Keep coming here and reading posts/questions and you'll gather a ton of useful info and tips. And check out u/hatherence's posts, she has made some great intuitive guides for a number of situations that I think will be really helpful to you.
---
Good luck Guardian!
---
I run blink warlock with tractor cannon, mountaintop and recluse. It's a pretty toxic set up to be honest.
---
It's more like an indication of what age/time period we are in. When Shadowkeep launches in October it will most likely change to a Shadowkeep background. Probably a bit of a marketing strategy to make people want to buy the newest expansion.
---
Why tf is that white space rhino here
---
Count me as hating it. I just got the catalyst recently and decided to get it masterworked. That didn’t last very long once I tried killing stuff with it. Yuck, insta dismantled it. Maybe someday when it gets a buff.
---
Shoot the shanks tho
---
I have a newborn, and I’m genuinely surprised I managed to finish solstice of heroes on one character
---
I mean you aimed at 2 people and killed 2.
---
 What's wrong here?
---
Refer a friend was discontinued with cross saves activation
---
Thank you! Good to know.
---
Thanks for this! I am loving the game and really want to dive into the raids.
---
AAAAHHHHH!!
---
One tip. Truth. And have a super ready when u go in there, good luck! It’s by far the worst part of the quest, took me forever, can’t tell u how many times I got 3 ppl out of 4...... it drove me nuts! And of course because u get nervous and know u have to get all 4 u mess up for no reason as well ugh, but managed to do it eventually
---
When I got to that portion I was not at a point of skill where I could get 4 players in one invasion. I tried many times but they were always too spread out to be able to get them all in the right amount of time.
---
Luckily, you can get an Army of One, or 3 times a teammate gets an Army of One. So I did an LFG and found a guy that was willing to do it for me. Two matches later it was done.
---
I appreciate the love, fellow guardian!! Sending the same wishes right back to you, we’ll rise to the challenge and come out with valor!
---
I'm not sure what piece you're missing, but if it's the helmet you need to do the weekly drifter bounties to get them. And you need to do them in order, first time it gives you the illicit helmet, second time it gives you the Outlaw helmet and the third time you get the notorious Helmet. You can only do the bounty for each set (reaper, collector, sentry, invader) once per week. So you can get all the helmets in 3 weeks. Once you unlock the helmet it gets added to the loot pool for reckoning so you can get different rolls.
---
Same here, I didn’t play D1 and bought D2 when the hype was high at launch (and the shadow shot artwork intrigued me as I thought we could use bows back then before forsaken), needless to say I love the game and still play it
---
I imagine a lot of the server issues right now are related to the switch to steam
---
Or you could just not have invaded with motes like a normal person and summoned before your opponents did
---
Especially since you invaded on the first primeval portal, meaning you didn’t have an invader on your side and all you had to do was clear the blockers

Faction packages (vanguard and crucible) drop 20 below your power level
---
Powerful Gear rewards drop above your level, other rewards drop 20 levels below your level. 
---
Also, heads up that all of everyone's gear will be boosted to 750 on Oct 1st to put everyone on a level playing field for Shadowkeep/Year 3.
---
That screen shot looks like it's from Pubg the Movie.
---
I swear, Shaxx is like a big kid. He’s just here to have a good time and never says a negative word.
---
Then you have another 47 forges
---
First thing to work on getting done will be the campaigns. Red War first. Then Curse of Osiris on Mercury followed by Warmind on Mars. 
---
That will be your initial level progression, intro to the game and its mechanics, etc. 
---
That will open you up to the year 1 end game including strikes, nightfalls, year 1 raids, etc. Can try all that out at your own discretion. 
---
Then it’s time to decide if you want any of the dlc. 
---
Also, I’d look into the “New Light” update which is adjusting the game. Base game and the dlc that currently comes with it will go free along with level cap increases and all patrol zones, crucible maps, etc. 
---
Year 2 dlc content beyond that will be available as a separate purchase as well as Shadowkeep and and other future dlc. That’s all up to you though. 
---
Play through what you have for now and then you can decide how much further you want to get into it.
---
can relate

The best part was when it made that sharp turn when he went up on the hill I cant even get my character to turn that fast

Try using telesto for the wizards. Idk what class you’re using but I did well plus telesto plus iron banner grenade launcher. Took me a few tries to get timing down but it’s a very rewarding experience doing it solo.

Didn't we have this exact same conversation about Hunters and their Gwinsin vest super several months ago?

I commented them in this post

O.o wtf is this?

Literally every time a new player plays a public event. Its so annoying.
---
Yeah. During my first solo pass, i struggled with void sniper rifle at that stage. But after i helped my friends to play Throne trough, i realised that Telesto is MVP.
---
^^^I've ^^^got ^^^it.

This is true. It's already a monster. What's your current MW level for it? I'm assuming your MW is for Range, right?

Bummer good luck on your anarchy chase

did you really put a mother fucking water mark on this image from a movie you don’t own
---
lol, I loooove dodging Nova bombs and blade barrages, this is great
---
Nokris strike
---
Yup, mid blink your hit box is actually extended from the point that you blinked from, making stupid stuff like this possible. For example, [this kill I got on a blinking Warlock](https://giant.gfycat.com/PaleWideeyedIcelandicsheepdog.mp4) (second kill in the clip) where I killed him despite my fusion rifle bolts hitting empty air. Felt a little bad lol.
---
They feel like they have more of a chance with the light level advantage.
---
It only matters against invaders and when your invading.
---
I have the Cayde figurine in my classroom. A couple of years ago I had a student I loved dearly who passed away in a car wreck. At his funeral, they gave out fishing bobbers because that kid loved to fish. I attached the bobber to Cayde's thumb. Now both of them are dead, and that figurine/bobber serve as a beautiful reminder that life is short, and I should remember to daily celebrate these students and even the (fictional) people I love. Thanks for this reminder, Guardian.
---
Not in the pve but yes in PvP aspects
---
it's force of habit
---
Is hunter really the easiest?
---
Damn... I guess I’m just really bad at pvp
---
This is unfortunately incorrect. Bungie has confirmed on multiple posts and videos that it will be eververse that becomes universal ornaments and all other armor can be obtained as armor 2.0 after the update. so you can re get any armor again as 2.0 but it won't be an ornament that you can apply to any other set of armor.
---
::punches thrall supportively::
---
you do not have a problem with cabal turrets going mowtown?
---
So it's not blink, it's just us stretching upward lol
---
Only a hunter would do this...and I have a hunter so I approve
---
Cayde would be disappointed
---
Very rude, uncalled for, and slightly understandable.
---
Could be an issue with the PC port on bnet.
---
I'm proud of you
---
I am pissed at this
---
If that's just for XP I could get on board with it, beats just getting engrams when you lvl up
---
Yea
---
Control equals Clash to most people unfortunately.
---
No...no...NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!
---
Delete this brother
---
I think they said it'll be coming in Shadowkeep
---
Yes, scout rifles do need a buff
---
bruh when is that ornament from? that thing is sick
---
Yes, thank you for implying that I will die by following Cayde’s approach to living life.
---
Or Glory!
---
*Haha, who am I kidding, we’re losing Glory.*
---
I'm actually ok with this, getting useless wvervese shit was kind of redundant.
---
Stay strong Guardian!

It is just XP. You CAN buy tiers, but you'll be able to level it up purely by playing.

How much is the other path?

At the moment soft cap is around 700, hard is 750, unless undying just came out then I dunno
---
Is that a fucking battle pass I swear to god
---
I'd be fine with this if there wasn't a premium feature -_-
---
Hm.. I play IB unwillingly for 6 hours straight, just so that it doesn't take any more of my days grinding for that stupid armor.
---
This really isn't a bad thing. You don't have to pay extra and it assures loot at set points.
---
FAILURE on the horizon.
---
I know people in the game call the Cabal that, but it doesn't make sense. They look nothing like rhinos and they don't even have a nose horn. Space hippo is more fitting.
---
Just the mountaintip
---
True but you don’t want to be playing so much that it messes up your sleep schedule
---
There's also space turtle
---
Rude but understandable.  All roaming supers could get a tweak.

I try to bait people to do this all the time. And then reverse it on them.

Nah doesn't really work as well.

This too shall pass brother. We are all in this together. We are the strongest community out there.

What is that "store" in top left?

I like using attunement of sky because I can pop super and fly back up.

Your guardian's down, but he managed to kill the only guy with 0 motes.

Traveler bless, you're doing good work. Up to 82% of the pulse kills, and I'm on my second reset now for Broadsword

That should be obvious

Exotic engram from Xur was counted for it as far I remember, isn't?

If it has accurised then yes

Tbh bd is not a very good weapon

It’s the Shrouded Stripes shader, if you didn’t figure it out yet

I think i got lucky, was 680~ when solstice came out, it went 690-720-750, all i need at that point was weapons, and that i just pulled out of collections till it hit 730, then farmed powerful gear to get to full 750.

Yep. Sounds exciting but it is uneasy with me. Depending on how they handle it it could be great or awful. Hopefully bungie prove their solo capabilities in Yr 3!

The fuck outta here with asshole words like that. You just don’t know how close people are sitting on the edge... one harmful comment can tip the scales against their favour. I spit on people like you, foul human piece of shit.
---
This might be over the top but I’ve been in a position where I thought about ending it and one little dangle berry like you could’ve made me do it... but no... I’m here and I want you to know I fucking loathe people like you and hope you get all the misfortune in the world.
---
You should’ve been wiped on a tissue.
---
Basically you just interact with any forge of your choice. And you can talk to Hawthorne and she’ll give you really low light gear. Dunno why it’s a thing, but it is.
---
My dad is not dead lol
---
Not saying your wrong. But starting to wonder if they really know what kind of game they wanted to make. Great that it'll be free to play for people to try out the game. Just find it sad that they are following in the foot steps of other games like Fortnite and Rocket League (which are both now under epic games). 
---
Expansions for games when I was young actually added a tonne of content. Now they just want to make money off cosmetics and the fact that people are ok with wasting money on these systems is making every video game the same. GTA is no better with their ridiculously priced in game items, that basically force people to buy shark cards, but at least the content is free. 
---
This tier system basically takes away from the random drop MMO style of game for me. So now if I don't buy a battle pass I don't get this content? And after the season ends I never have a chance to get that gear?
---
That’s cute! A perfect place for him.
---
It'll never happen. They were removed because it caused crashes that they couldn't nail down in time for release
---
That's absolute bull
---
sure.
---
I really appreciate the sentiment, but my dad has not passed- just lives far away. :) Definitely can’t say the same for Cayde, though :(
---
Not yet
---
Pretty sure that was the case, yes. I don’t think it was for PS4 only.
---
I.....fuck, now I can’t UNsee it.
---
Honestly reading something takes like 1/4 the time.
---
No shit
---
Yet you're on the subreddit where there's scores of guides for this kind of thing...
---
Here's your upvote...
---
oh good, it is unnecessarily a hard quest. Congrats
---
Retweet
---
Yes it is. I almost want to say it was worse than Zero Hour.
---
I’m okay with this specifically because I don’t like buying everything. And I’d rather get it out of engrams and year two. As much as I played. Didn’t get a whole lot
---
Oh god oh fuck
---
That's a cool ass Honda shirt your Dad's rocking too.  This post made me happy, thanks.
---
Fair enough
---
Oh, I totally misinterpreted the whole thing. I'm sorry. 
---
.
---
Gosh I'm such an idiot
---
When life gives you lemons, turn them into tomatoes.
---
I could 100% see how you did, and to be honest with you I don’t think you’re the only one. 100% didn’t mean to make it seem like my dad is dead! No biggie! Haha
---
Happy birthday

Braytech Winter Wolf, its an awesome auto... Not sure if it was brought to y2 or not though
---
Sneak peak of shadowkeep?
---
Holy shit that's good
---
Alright, good luck

You get it from a story mission on titan, so keep going buddy

The Battle Pass is an extra fee.
---
I love the shooting and the game is a lot of fun. It's why I came back but holy shit the drop rates seem so so bad. 8+ hours a day for the last 3 days and zilch.
---
Ignore the troll and move on.
---
PvP rumble... grind it. You’ll find that laggy fella in the corner eventually
---
The second it said “enemy has summoned primeval” it died
---
Terrible RNG. 
---
You're feeling the same way I did after 30+ completions without a 1K
---
Me in Gambit Prime, as my Titan colourized 2019

Mercury is like California.
---
It's pretty....but man does it suck.
---
(Sorry if you're a Cali native)
---
No it is not. If you get Shadowkeep then you get Season Of the Undying and that comes with the “battle pass”
---
If you purchase Shadowkeep you get the season of the Undying and the season pass which includes the "battle pass". Each new season will be 10 bucks and they will also include the "battle pass". It's literally additional content included in the price for each season. The annual pass last year was 34.99 at launch. With the new system it'll only be 30 bucks for the remaining 3 seasons IF you opt in to buying them all. Even then if you dont you still get access to the free tier of the battle pass. You're not paying an extra 10 for season of undying. It's included in Shadowkeep. Just breathe and read, man. Inform yourself.
---
Dayyyyyyyyyyyyyum.
---
Got'em.
---
Hell I would take any exotics at this point. I mean anything, just to see a few drop here and there. I've already finished all my weekly stuff and it's Thursday. So without the exotic chase I feel like I've got nothing to log in for until Tuesday. I almost feel like I did when I used to farm mounts in wow. I'd log in on Tuesday /Wednesday do all the old raids nothing would drop and oh well nothing to do until reset.
---
Plz don’t tell me you are one of the people who say “muh pay to win.”
---
You must be fun at parties.
---
Yes, because that's what blind weak willed little fanboys do. The look the other way when they are getting ripped off.
---
ALL THE CHAOS REACHS!
---
Go on...
---
"Howd you die"
---
"Yes"
---
I always go back to orbit
---
With the free version of the Battle pass. There is a "premium" version also.
---
I know. I'm sorry. I'll uninstall and unsub.
---
Actually if you look at the screenshot of the season pass, you can Clearly see an auto rifle. That is no skin.
---
The only difference I’ve had within the last 2 weeks is now I have all 3 characters in free roam universe. Some reckon that could be the difference but up till then it was constant grind for anything
