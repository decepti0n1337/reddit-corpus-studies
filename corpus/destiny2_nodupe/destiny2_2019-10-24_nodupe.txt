No, I just wasn‚Äôt high enough light to do it till the last day
---
---
---
Honestly sounds like your fireteam just lacks a general understanding of the mechanics because this is by far one of the easiest boss to kill. 
---

---
My clan has cleared it many times over already and have sherpaed many new raiders from our clan.
---
NP share it foward!
---
Unpopular opinion: I don‚Äôt care for the armor ornaments. It looks like something you would find in a Walmart discount costume section 10 days after Halloween ended. 
---
The Auto rifle however looks great and I will grind for it for sure.
---
Grind activities on the moon and do the essence quests at the lectern
---
Every class has 3 specializations. Solar (fire), Void (dark energy?) and lighting.
---
Solar abilites are the abilities in "fire" tree - granades, melee and the last skill

As soon as someone invades, take note of where your teammates are standing. 9 times out of 10 the invader will spawn farthest away from you and your team. So by process of elimination you‚Äôll be able to figure out where they spawn. Once you know where they are you can make a few decisions. Are they using heavy? Stay back. Is a teammate fighting him? Back him up. Even if he dies you might be able to revive him rendering the invaders efforts useless. Do you have 10 or more motes? RUN! RUN AND HIDE! They will do everything in their power to kill you. They could wipe your teammate but if gets sent back and you still have your 15 motes he will be kicking himself. Nothing make an invader angrier than having to deal with the Taken Knight that‚Äôs about to spawn. Are you way ahead? You can wait him out. Not fighting is a choice. Sometimes invaders invade just to kill you to waste your time. You manage to live through his whole invade you haven‚Äôt lost much. Running back to the fight from your spawn is time wasted. Hope this helps. Now go do it again!
---
Lady Efrifeet wants to know your location.
---
I guess this raid would be the "bad" one for you. CoS did me in real hard too. Come back to it after a while and run with people who have built up good experience in the raid. Or join a good sherpa to get it done eventually. But for the mo, just so something else. Raid is not going anywhere.
---
What do I need to do to craft Bygones in Black Forge? 
---
Do I need both blue gambit bounty from Ada (kill 2 mvp targets) + pulse rifle schematic?
---
Part of Destiny is the secrets and discovering them. Do not make Bungie feed new players with a spoon.
---
Holy shit dude chill out, talk about fucking baggage jesus
---
As awesome as that sounds, if that gun 1 shot like that everyone and their decrepid grandmothers would be running that gun.
---
Hey! I just got this today
---
Yup. It hurts so good. I get depressed when they pop up and hit an edge and proceed to bounce off the map.
---
Gold thank you bro ‚úå
---
When 7empest comes in with that intro i know it's going to be a good ride. Ticks and leechees sets me on doom guy mode for crucible too.
---
Fair. Maybe give us 6 shots to start with so we can proc the first shot with the bonus dmg?
---
E: as in more shots to carry the first glance proc
---
I was worried because I had completed all the essence quests. I see now I can purchase them for phantasmal cores. Well back to grinding!
---
We already know. The top one won't, cus he get's tilted by the littlest things,, and people will leave. Teehee

It's not like anything in destiny really makes sense anyway lol
---
Yes
---
Aww man you missed out. That shit leveled me so fast
---
They will probably be 950 depending on the activity you are doing
---
You are correct. I didn‚Äôt mean to generalize all raiders wanting to do a fast/quick run with skilled people so it doesn‚Äôt take all night, I totally get that it‚Äôs just far too often I run into the few bad groups of people with no patience and this ends up ruining everyone else‚Äôs reputation
---
But then it was all just a nightmare
---
It‚Äôs just a weird quest objective that‚Äôs horribly worded. For someone who doesn‚Äôt usually get multikills without swapping their weapons, it would be very difficult
---
Oh don‚Äôt worry. They‚Äôll bring it back. But it‚Äôll cost you 600 silver.
---
With d1 and 2 combined, I'd say it probably over 1000 hours for me, using a titan or hunter is so much fun after weeks of warlock gameplay.
---
Im sorry but this made me laugh out loud because i was listening to call her daddy and they say if your a 5 or a 6 you DIE FOR THAT DIC as if you were in the sahara desert and his cumm is what keeps you alive and this is pretty much showing what that looks like.
---
That‚Äôs where you pick them up again so yea try that
---
All I get are fucking secondaries
---
Man I fucking hate unstoppable ogres
---
*boop*
---
Keep at it! Youll find what works for those sweet one man armies!
---
You're welcome
---
Who is the original artist of this comic? Kinda looks like that one boy Pablo song video?
---
recently switched to maining titans and.....im just gonna say it. I miss golden gun.
---
And she doesnt want that dick either?
---
You can do any nightfall now
---
I heard that it was going to be fixed on the 29th
---
If by noticeable you mean it didn't actually do anything then yes. Instead of fixing it they just removed it without even buffing the exotic.
---
What the hell have you brought upon this land
---
Damn, already time for that again? The years keep getting shorter
---
It worked! Thanks
---
Have you tried shoulder charging ?
---
Oh
---
Thanks

Who needs guns
---
I‚Äôve seen that is not too good... what do you say?
---
You know, you aint wrong
---
Thanks for this! Not sure why my controller config randomly switched.
---
Before I reset my gambit rank to zero for delirium 21% , is there any other quest that I can kill two birds with one stone ?
---
Did this ever get figured out? My friend is missing his quest too and don‚Äôt know what to tell him.
---
If you know how you need to trun down volume a bit then when he loses his ghost the music should start to fade out there if you know how and if not could I do it?
---
Welcome to the fold, but Trust is better, not gonna lie
---
I got one last night. I did all the bounties for the week but chased them in at the same time. It may be RNG but it worked for me.
---
Thank you!
---
So the titan is a cabal, the warlock a hive i think, but what is the hunter?
---
Cabal was 100% times better
---
The first minute of that video was unneeded....
---
True
---
Helmet stays on.
---
This is why i stopped playing destiny. I got really heated
---
r/sharditkeepit
---
Yep. Nightfall after nightfall and raid after raid. Lol I felt dirty when I bought it from Xur.
---
r/fireteams
---
Don't forget to go to the settings and turn the "edge" setting to max.
---
Oof
---
I thought they made everything free except for Shadowkeep and the future season passes ($10 each).
---
Ok, odd ask. But can we see some pvp gameplay?
---
The best is when you‚Äôre already out of there but you still get the last guy with a rocket or a damage over time effect
---
no one did. its part of the new light main quest
---
Your last advice is truly helpful. I‚Äôm new at gambit , when I invade and opposite team have no motes on them, I find very useful to make them lose time not getting any motes in a while, and of course  trying to kill them
---
Brainless monkeys who only invade with super, heavy, or Jotunn... smfh
---
You are a good man. Thank you.
---
Haha yeah except I have no friends
---
I mean i know they wanna make a hard mission for an exotic, but from what ive heard it isnt really all too good at the moment. The vanity of having it would be nice, but there are so many other weapons that seem better like izanagis or deathbringer, even if they have much longer quests. Its just annoying dying in a single hit ti every thing and having no way of defending yourself.
---
As awsome as this was.... how was there zero stromcaller activations in here?!?!  but great job!
---
Ehh five months, I‚Äôd give it a pass.
---
For Christ‚Äôs sake go to Walmart and pay $4 for a mouse
---
Probably not.
---
My buddy has done 30+ LW and SotP full raid completions with no 1k Voices or Anarchy. I have only ever completed the final encounter of LW twice and SotP 3 times. I have both exotics. He despises me.
---
OP is talking about the glow. Those blue sets have decent and underutilized models anyway, for a free event this is a really unique set of armor to look forward to.
---
I had Duty Bound in rotation all through the first 2 years, but now I truly wonder
---
Basically me. Was there for the whole run, if being the lost, confused, horde bait counts as participating. 
---
God. Bless. Self-Res.
---
I'm trying to go for the undying title. You could complete it in Leviathan?
---
I only ever got a full wipe when I got lucky one time. I Black Talon-ed a guy in super, plus one more. Then I Blade Barraged the final 2 who were doing DPS on the Primeval.
---
Probably only happened because they had a super though.
---
I just don‚Äôt use it because it doesn‚Äôt help with my play style
---
It‚Äôs still there!
---
Sorry. Lol
---
I wish they would add guns to sparrows and have dog fights with your ships.
---
Because it‚Äôs fun to win, mayhem is the best game mode for just having fun
---
I liked season of OWOpulence.
---
Season*
---
Last season not last year. 
---
The current set is the original crucible set from year one.
---
I was playing last night and a teammate of mine got 5 kills on one invasion. I've played quite a bit of Gambit, but that's the first 5 kill invasion I've seen in person.
---
0 Intellect gang
---
Winning is fun? I'm not saying you're wrong for not using meta weapons or playing for fun, but if you go into an invasion without using weapons that are good for invading, you're just going to hurt your team and that's not really fair to them if they actually do want to win.
---
So equip the broken gear.
---
i think you got the broken one inside your collection
---
I don‚Äôt know they both rip new buttholes
---
Back in d1, iron lord artifacts have unique perks. One of these perks was the ability to ‚Äútame‚Äù enemies using your melee with a 30%? Chance
---
You‚Äôre a mean one... XD
---
We‚Äôll see, I‚Äôm going to do some public events first, see if this is even remotely doable.
---
Finally a titanfall meme
---
I mean with PvE AND PvP elements. Besides, the LAST time I tried to play mayhem, everyone just used tether.
---
**year
---
The wing contender set was last years set. It was avalable for all of last year. Starting when forsaken launched. Until the launch of shadowkeep. Now it‚Äôs the year one set again, and will most likely be the year one set for the remainder of shadowkeep.
---
I've been on r/guitarcirclejerk too much. Saw the guitar emote and thought `0-3-5`
---
No it's for the leviathans breath quest I believe
---
No idea.  But, the same step for Leviathans Breath.
---
Edit:  Carry on guardian.  Your path requires Vex Offensive precision kills.
---
No time! Got a new (2 mo.) kiddo, I‚Äôm doing good if I get an hour to play at night.
---
Where the hell is this? I wanna try it now!
---
Awesome! Thanks for your consideration m8!
---
Same
---
Also, if you wanna win in Gambit, just go to Gambit Prime instead.
---
sanctuary on the moon near eris morn :D
---
Same here, I,liked the long grind to high power, and it is much more satisfying.
---
suffer
---
thank you :D
---
Beloved, from the menagerie
---
Twilight Oath, also from menagerie
---
Badlander, from... 
---
Honestly, just look the menagerie recipes, you'll find something.
---
Titans are always fun to use especially if your in the mood for FISTING things
---
It just took me ~40 minutes to beat with 2 randoms &amp; two of us were dead when we killed him. I nearly cried. I've been trying at this for 3 hours...
---
I play all. When it comes to competitive modes such as Gambit and Iron Banner, I'll be sure to bring my best stuff with me. Sure it's fun to screw around when I play with my clanmates like all running Hard Lights or Sweet Business or Rat King, because that's also a form of fun. But winning is the one that gives me most fun.
---
My brother has done last wish 20 something times and has every exotic but that
---
Note also my friend said he had 40:0 kd
---
Middle bottom.....It looks like a face to me.
---
Even better teleporting spawncampers.
---
We'll just beat dat ass the old fashioned way
---
Just looks like a bunch of craggy cliffs and ether, but aight.
---
It‚Äôs not as bad as being called a Warlock. That some major disrespect. All they do is play like bitches in their rifts or rely on Getaway Artist (aka Skill less Artist) ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Can confirm
---
I do. But gambit does have a pvp element to it ands it‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs job to do their best to contribute. Also your argument is inane. We‚Äôre not supposed to pvp or pvp they way we want in a pvp environment? I suppose you‚Äôre the type of person that wishes we all had muskets in gambit and lined up 2x2, stood 50 yards apart and shot each other too, honorably right?
---
I want it as well, but it‚Äôs just a matter of collecting at this point. I never thought I‚Äôd be able to reach 5500 b/c I‚Äôm solo, but freelance has opened the opportunity to at least try :)
---
Bro this is like the opposite #Hunter for life aka the best call
---
Are the helmet and cloak legendary pieces?
---
Right! And they have the nerve to complain about the OEM
---
Interesting....
---
If you're on PS4 I'd be up for it
---
so if i only have vanilla destiny and no dlc, do only weapons/gear from vanilla drop for me? i had bought the game before the first DLC came out and left at that point
---
Confirmed to be sold for bright dust!
---
Really? Wow things are changing.
---
Are you guys sure about that? I used to tripple warlock on D1 and recently got D2 and I was just repeating the same activities ive already done on my first warlock &amp; still got the rewards for my second one, boosted me from like 918 to 922 or so unless i just got lucky? I mean the map shows that I'm eligable for the powerful rewards t1/t2 on my 2nd character even if ive already done them on my first like strikes/nightfall/crucible etc
---
Is that Sparrow genuinely only for Warlocks or am I misunderstanding?
---
No, because Gambit is the fucking wild west. I learned that the hard way
---
Me trying to do daily bounties
---
Can confirm, did this today with nova warp blink. Blink, activate nova warp, fall to death immediately.
---
Im hoping they do, NM had some bomber chest pieces for titan
---
Their grip on Freehold? Broken.
---
I mean I hate OEM as much as the next guy as well as bottom tree striker, but these rift Locks and Artist users are a lot more common, at least for me, and it‚Äôs just so annoying to play against.
---
I remember way back in D1 with the vex Mythoclast. It was my first time even being in the raid and i was completely useless but I got. They stopped playing with me for a week.
---
Makes sense
---
Riskrunner if your fighting the fallen a lot, let them shoot you and proc the effect first before going ham on them though. Graviton Lance is great for add clearing with a couple of headshots.
---
Just because you paid doesn‚Äôt mean everyone else did
---
Thats a kinetic sniper.
---
I loved the haunted forest
---
Still better.
---
SAME! I chucked a nade right before I left and got the 4th kill. I was so happy because I had already had like 4 invasions that I only got 3 kills in that game
---
I managed to wipe the entire enemy team twice in the same match, when they were all carrying between 5 and 15 motes. Felt like a god, even though I knew that it only happened because none of them were apparently paying any attention (all in the open and not even keeping an eye out for me...)
---
Mine was with with a godly rolled Fate Cries Foul Sniper, and my next was Queenbreaker in its broken state.
---
current dlc of course
---
They can‚Äôt do that
---
DRB and MBA have stupid range for the killshot. Oddly enough I roll bottom tree striker with oem and I'm still just as killable (I more than likely just suck, i hardly use my super cause i prefer using my guns over my super.) I'm probably in the minority of titans that feel like the bottom tree super just doesn't sit well. Imo I shouldn't have my super still going to the point that it's entirely possible to shut out the opposite team in one match depending on the map.
---
they just did it to me
---
Yeah it took them way to long to nerf spectral blades
---
Wait theres a step AFTER the precision?
---
weren't all roaming supers op and invincible?
---
Thanks! Good luck too I guess.
---
I think the still wendigo is more useful in most pve situations and raids.
---
How did you get a recording of me in PvP
---
they are that broken...
---
*Cries in almost 900hrs hunter, as I drift away with my Moebius Quiver*
---
What gun is that?
---
how? I don't get it how they are that broken?
---
they hard tracks u, give dmg AND overshield when kill, literally everyone who plas pvp for a long time can say it is very broken
---
The song choice just seems off to me, idk why but I expected something with more of a western feel to it, might solely only be influenced by Cayde using a handcannon but still.
---
Peak performance!
---
Thank you
---
Real version: [https://i.imgur.com/XPXMHkh.png](https://i.imgur.com/XPXMHkh.png)
---
[Wasted on Destiny](https://wastedondestiny.com/) will tell you exactly how much.
---
what? so true sight and a damage buff....
---
why did middle tree night stalkers truesight get nerfed then? I always thought it just gave overshield
---
 [https://i.imgur.com/XPXMHkh.png](https://i.imgur.com/XPXMHkh.png) 
---
dont use that phone poster version
---
I got told I suck at invading today by a guy just like this when I had 16 guardian kills at the end of the game lol
---
havent u heard becuz it has been discussed for a very long time that they will have to nerf it and bottom tre striker
---
Classic warlock looks like dumbass as always.
---
No they didn‚Äôt
---
Thank you! What do you mean by a new title?
---
This is the second time i have seen this song used for a destiny montage but for sure the best. 
---
The first was back when the thunderlord came out someone made a compelation vid for it nowhere near as good though, well done.
---
Doors and corners, kid. That's where they get you.
---
Spectral was also invisible  and gwinsin kept it going infinitely until you got 5 kills. it‚Äôs been the more popular super since it‚Äôs release and no other super ever overtook it
---
I'm kinda new to pvp I've only heard complaints but not why they should be nerfed so hearing this it makes much more sense
---
You can go past 971 with the artifact cant you?
---
If you're on the Primeval then killing yourself is always an option. This way your death doesn't heal the Primeval and you're safe for 1/3 of his invasion time.
---
Weekly powerful are class unique. It may have boosted you because your armor was lacking behind your guns.
---
If you‚Äôre on PC I apologize that was probably me because I did that tonight. While I don‚Äôt make titan it is very fun and easy to play in comp. I 100% agree it needs to be nerfed
---
I'm getting to that point with a few things, I've just been grinding Crucible so I can reset my rank and finish an old exotic (I've got a lot of old exotic quests)
---
Pve- bottom tree voidwalker with nezaracs sin helmet. Devour gives health and grenade regen constantly and quick supers due to void kills and helmet perk. Recommend use recluse and void heavy with. 
---
Pvp- tough because every subclass tree can be fun and effective in pvp if used properly. Good rounded build is middle tree voidwalker with contraverse hold exotic arms. Strong neutral game with grenade and melee, allows for weapon loadout flexibility depending on map and preference. Additionally blink is fun and effective jump when used well and enhances the super greatly.
---
I'm sorry but you're in my spot.
---
[removed]
---
500 hours? Heh that‚Äôs rookie numbers
---
Can I play pvp tho?
---
Do you have forsaken dlc on pc?
---
yeeeeeeeeeeet!
---
/r/techsupport perhaps.
---
happened to me last night. my team mates revived me so much. and at the end i got a kinetic gun. i felt useless.
---
I pretty much do the same with my hunter with blade barrage... Always forget you dive in the direction your pressing so I usually throw them at a rock or pillar
---
My first one man army was with tractor cannon, I love that thing. Great for both pvp and buffing your damage with nova bomb or such.
---
Add me on Xbox JofinnSenpai 
---
I will usually find a team but they cannot survive the bridge at all. Only time I finish is when I switch to Warlock which unfortunate cause I have two other characters that need gear
---
I mean name checks out
---
I having fun with captain void build. 100 nade energy, doomfangs and press Q to win..
---
Its your fault for letting a titan get close. There is good reason the chimps in the zoo are behind a fence.. they will bite your face off.
---
*claps*
---
Sit down, let me tell you a story about the old Nightfalls from year one, and Destiny 1...
---
.. so anyways, this felt nice and challanging.
---
The only other thing in Destiny 2 that really gives you a titty twister-like hard mode is NM hunts at 980 now, which is great
---
cheatin this hard will get them banned real fast. don't worry. those Kids will burn through a lot of F2P accounts fast...
---
Posted there as well, thx
---
Lets hope they get sonethin worked out on it.
---
For me, it was graphic card driver which was doing that. Had to uninstall it and than make clean instalation
---
My Ability to resist making the joke? not strong enough
---
Gives you the highest damage super in the game next to Chaos Reach + Geomags lol.
---
Tried that and tried to run every single test to my graphic card, all the results came back normal
---
One of the keys is bugged and bungie even mentioned they know of it (or atleast thats what my friend told me) so you musta not needed the bit that was glitched
---
Why so angry?
---
Its just a video game. You have exploded into a huge rant.
---
Recluse is not that OP, unless you fight people at short range. Don't you have recluse too?
---
You don't need Randy's throwing knife right now do you? So chill. Do less crucible, run it for a shorter amount each week. You have like 6 more weeks to earn everything for Undying season yet. No need to try do the quest in a huge grind in one week. That is how you burn yourself out.
---
Also, you are not a STRONG crucible player if you have a mental breakdown over it....just saying.
---
The other team: good win boys!.... wait what
---
After a couple more hours of attempts with a few different groups I finally got it, thank you though! Do need to find some more peeps to play with.
---
Glad I could help :)
---
I got it on my 2nd run when my sherpa still hadn't gotten it after like 50 runs. So i made this video. [https://youtu.be/H5dzz8FTgJE](https://youtu.be/H5dzz8FTgJE)
---
monkaS
---
I use a warlock with ease especially against titans
---
Hold my beer
---
Ah, I still don‚Äôt have Izanagis Burden because I haven‚Äôt got the keys when I do the forge ignitions.
---
Its all good lol
---
You're right there's nothing hot about that.
---
He was probably talking about her appearance.
---
üèÖ
---
Yes, that would be a sound strategy. But, when the goombas that matchmaking sets you up with ignore all the mechanics of the match. Such as not taking out blockers quickly and standing in the center focusing on the prime evil instead of taking covert action to not get one shot by an invader who has an over shield and a super. By the time I take out the invader someone is already dead.
---
I mean its not about love, just the fact that she's canonically the best person to handle the portal thats literally in front of her 24/7. The better question is why everyone thinks its gonna go wrong when the damn woman can drop novabombs with the power and size of nukes. One vex comes through that gate and she's there waiting, but fine lets take Ikea out of the equation, there's a dozen guardians in the tower at any given time, Ada with an arsenal of weapons, Drifter with an army of taken at his fingertips, plus being the oldest risen in the tower with a hyper active need to survive, AND the vanguard. 
---
Three guardians are enough to chew through an army of vex in a strike, six guardians are able to annihilate even more vex in the garden, kill a taken ahamkara yada yada yada, you get the gist.
---
Exotic rewards were removed from the Red War campaign.
---
Banshee do something please
---
Because light level or rather power level doesn‚Äôt matter in pvp unless you‚Äôre playing iron banner. So using an objectively worse weapon since blue weapons have lower overall stats and fewer perks, or worse armor since blue armor usually rolls with lower stats, only hurts you and your team in the end
---
Now put in the vault haha! But congrats!!
---
I think its about when the light comes back and we see her through the perspective of a warlock as she fights. But even then, theres that bit about her leveling half of old chicago in her battle with shaxx. She can destroy a city if she wants lets be real. If she can drop a novabomb the size of half chicago, aint no vex is surviving a bomb from her.
---
also 2000 hours
---
They give you more xp but the loot has gotten worse
---
if bungo used this as commercial a lot more people would have joined the new light .
---
awesome montage . you my dude got some real talent there . keep on the good work .
---
if you find a good song and footage for Solar or Void I'd PayPal you 50‚Ç¨ and not even kidding
---
I think you can easily 1 phase it with a couple of liar‚Äôs handshake hunters.
---
Darci too. If that's the name of the heavy sniper rifle
---
World
---
Yep, its really annoying, especially if you just started and have the whole exotic loot pool to go against.
---
Then again, i have most of them, but i keep getting duplicates instead of wavesplitter or suros, the only 2 exotics i have left.
---
I opened 2 season pass exotic engrams recently, and got fighting lion and coldheart. No justice, i thought you couldnt get dupes from exotic engrams anymore but clearly you can.
---
A  midas multi tool should aid you in early crucible stage before you acquired any meta pvp weapon , and it could deal with most of the meta weapon . the best part  it is very easy to get .
---
Now search vex booby milk!!
---
I'm running a similar setup, but with 2 gtx1080ti's and I was getting random crashes and restarts with the Kernel power (41) critical errors and it was a bad psu.  If you're using a surge protector you might try plugging straight into the wall to eliminate that from the chain, but that error alone is most likely a psu issue. If its throwing an error that reads nvidia or similar along with the OP error try uninstalling the driver with DDU and reinstalling and see what happens. I chased that ghost for 2 months before buying a new psu and my system has ran flawless since.
---
But then again, some foke'll
---
hunters op, waaaaa
---
Did you miss the /s?? Or are you new to the internet??
---
I am not much of pvp player i mean i don't like pvp in general but free for all seems to be fairly fun and didn't have any problems except people with good aim
---
Use the discord Destiny 2 PC LFG, a quick search would have found you it.
---
There is a destiny lfg server on discord
---
izanagi burden , heammerhead , joturn , truth , ace of spade
---
But why?
---
Imo Recovery is best, 2nd is Intellect. Because Recovery have a big impact on self regen, and Intellect because Super regen was nerfed. Or you may look at it this way. Intellect mods will cost you 5 energy, Recovery - 4 energy, they are expensive, so it's better to have these stats high on your Armor, so you don't have to use mods for them, or use as little as possible.
---
Strength is useless for Hunters - you can dodge to have ur Melee back and dodge have fast regen on it's own.
---
Discipline is not good too, Hunters Grenades are meh. And you can regen ur grenade in other ways. Weapons with demolition perk (kill 4-5 ads = grenade ready), mod for ur class item, when you pick up orb of light you get some grenade energy (like 10-15%).
---
My own preference in armor stats is Recovery &gt; Intellect &gt; Mobility.
---
The thing is that i was thinking that it was my PSU doing the problems,
---
So I went and bought a new PSU, a really good one, and still it‚Äôs crashing my pc.
---
I‚Äôm plugged straight to the wall without any other connections
---
Any reason? 
---
I like to lead newer players through first time clears for fun, I am sure you could easily find a sherpa in one of the many discords that are out there - the raids aren't really that intimidating once you learn them!
---
What does karma give you?
---
Destiny hire this man as an advertising genius
---
It‚Äôs okay, I have 1000+ hours on hunter across both games and still BB/Tether into walls often enough
---
Nono, I know that. But you can't really do anything without earning XP. Logistically speaking, there's no way you could have gotten anything above 750 power after New Light came out and remained at 0 XP, because XP/Ranks are shared between characters.
---
Turns out it's just a bug tho so it's no biggie. Was just *really* confusing.
---
I got everything but field prep on mine :(. Still grinding this out.
---
I ones nova bomb the wall next to me while on the other side there was the enemy team taking a spot...
---
I feel soo conflicted about the nova bomb.
---
You should say more, yes.
---
Otherwise this is just a shitpost.
---
Ohhh can i add this to wallpaper engine? Thats super cool
---
Ouch, i also got mine first try, ill be sure to pass him my luck for it now
---
ya youve never made a mistake in quickplay im sure
---
Sick!
---
I love the martial arts fighting style that the Arc Staff has. It's hands down my favorite super in the game.
---
If you use whirlwind guard from the middle tree you feel like a jedi when you deflect a golden gun shot.
---
Burst glide kills ):
---
Can confirm that it still looks like this after almost 1000 hours
---
field prep gives outlaw-level reload speed when crouched
---
Ah fu-
---
You'll catch up, just send them 2 large blockers and one titan with super.
---
A dopamine rush
---
Well, now I want to play Destiny....... They should make this an official trailer. Soooo good.
---
There are triumphs that you need to do within the Vex offensive which requires Bow Kills and precision kills, if you want to gain the Undying Title
---
Yee all 3 of my chars are like 960 now
---
All hunter exotics are shit so regardless of what you get you still get shitty stuff. Got Celestial while wearing Celestial yesterday. 30 min later got Sixth Coyote and of course it's duplicate. I'm not even excited to see Exotic engram at this point. I have also all exotic that it could've drop.
---
Unless you‚Äôre a hunter running BB with shards.
---
I‚Äôm thankful it‚Äôs getting bumped up a bit. Dawnblade is my favorite super
---

Expected you to round a corner and get kneed by a titan

Well, if I've learned anything about loot vacuum from Warframe, we just need to start a years long circlejerk to get it.
---
There're complain but nobody including Bungie gave fuck.
---
I want my ghost now please.
---
Breathtaking
---
It depends for everyone but I really can‚Äôt see myself playing anything aside from warlock. They have good offense and defense, can be pretty fast and are fun to use. It might take a little skill but it‚Äôs definitely worth it.
---
Killing the hydra's have nothing to do with overlord spawning.....
---
Lord Shaxx has never done anything important before
---
Unlucky raspberries.
---
O I agree and if they could give the phoenix dive 2 more frames of healing, I would be happy guardian. And wouldnt even complain about the neutral game anymore
---
Wrong.

NO THIS IS VERY BAD! I love gambit to death and rock the invader gear because of the cool red snakes. Oh and because I main invader in the mode. Invaders completely disrupt enemy tempo in gambit. To be an efficient invader you either remove motes by killing enemies carrying them preferably getting 20+ for what I consider to be a "good invade" or if you have the armor you stall. When you invade with armor THE BANK IS LOCKED. All those izanagi, truth, instant super casts can't stop you from stalling their bank for all 30 seconds. If they get feisty and look for you, you have wallhacks so even with the meta right now being run a 1 shot overshield weapon, when they don't have their long sight line it doesn't help that much. Draining motes is very slow, around 1 per 1.5 seconds it feels plus there is little cover in the middle so unless you need 5 motes for primeval it's not really worth it. So back to the main point... PLEASE blueberries 
---
A. Don't take the portal from someone running invader armor with current game track records of 3+kills and crazy mote denial.
---
B. If I didnt take the portal, there is a reason. Enemy team has no motes, I just killed them all and want to use my kill monger x4 to dps a target on our side, etc.
---
C. Don't super an invader unless we are in our burn phase, it's a waste.
---
D. Invaders have 3 spawn locations, learn them (legit normal ai spawns) he will generally be the farthest away from your team. And if you have no motes, hunt the invader if you aren't clearing, or at least do something instead of hiding with less than 5 motes.
---
Sorry for the rant, but I can already see someone on my team trying to do this, actually managing to get a 4k and swing the match in our favor only to waste another invasion while the enemy team has 0 motes to lose. Invasions are valuable, don't waste them to thirst for kills, this isn't crucible.
---
Lol brilliant!
---
This is regarding the undying title lol
---
I won‚Äôt.
---
Ikora's waiting by the Vex Gate with her Invective waiting to pop off
---
I actually really like it but I mainly use bows.
---
Super nice to send a massive arrow down range and take out beefy targets before they become a threat.
---
Coming from me, it has a lot of utility and is pretty effective at what it's designed for.
---
I miss good looking armor.....
---
I was thinking, "Bungie should hire this person."
---
^
---
Never done ANYTHING important?! Fighting in the red war?! Training guardians like you to face bigger threats everyday?! If not fir me you guardians wouldn‚Äôt be able to shoot straight!
---
I never realized how useful Phoenix Dive was until the pyramidion and how you can go through the lasers with it. Completely changed how I play
---
Wait until OEM is nerfed, the warlocks will beat the shit out of us both
---
Oi, dont you speak about Senpai that way. He's been lifting my spirits every match even though I suck ass at Crucible.
---
*Laughs in Twilight Gap*
---
There's a song here, I know it!
---
Happy birthday
---
Maybe I should do so recovery investment lol
---
I thought this post was about leviathan‚Äôs breath.
---
There should be something around Energy in the system settings of windows, else maybe click on the battery icon
---
Do bears shit in the woods?
---
Try the Nightmare Hunt for Crota at 920.  Had my 1st two rando's quit on me after wiping 3 times.  Next two came in and we beat him but it was a ball breaker.
---
If you like that, the [heatmap tool](https://chrisfried.github.io/secret-scrublandeux/) by /u/chrisfried puts that site (and if you've played this game a lot, your own _lack of a_ life) to shame.
---
She's definitely into warlocks.

I want an AI on Titan.  C'mon, there are even cameras watching us go everywhere, and what are all those CPUs for anyway??
---
MOAR AI
---
It is a good time, very fun to make videos on
---
Be happy they had the rewards for the pass levels to 100, instead of complaining?
---
I actually plan to grind for not forgotten, oh boi this is going to be fuuuuun x'D
---
and good luck!
---
It‚Äôs not a complaint only a suggestion, I‚Äôm happy either way
---
Ah fuck. I can't believe you've done this.
---
I was really hoping it did.
---
Ikora, it's her punishment for building that dumbass Vex Portal
---
Thank you for this link!!  But also ouch...1580 hours and 33 minutes on D2.  1126 hours and 34 minutes on D1.  
---
Time to go outside.....after one more strike.
---
God you guys rock. Info like this is hella helpful.
---
This is what peak performance looks like.
---
Believe that shows how much light it is above your current power level but idk
---
No it‚Äôs the mindbender
---
Mad? Lol I'm not the one who's whine on reddit. I just commented because all I see is people cry about titans. To get anything done? Dude I obtained recluse, close to Randy's and I don't have oem, or used striker all along in the first place.
---
This hit me right in the feels. So sympathetic yet offended at the same time.
---
I fucking hate that one guy. Must've run into that one guy the past 40-50 public events. I always unmute mic and try to tell people nearby to google heroic events knowing damn well NOBODY uses a mic in this game. Fucking morons.
---
60 days ago, Champ. Does it take 60 days to finish your Hooked on Phonics? You are doing great!
---
This is how I got Anarchy.  I cackled so hard.... I'm still sorry.
---
i was sat here waiting like "lets see what '500 hours' can do that anyone could do with the right random chance opportunity" and that caught me straight off guard, gave me a good laugh
---
to the body it feels good
---
I see you too are a man of culture.
---
I had a similar issue with one of the other forges, I ended up waiting until the next one in the rotation.
---
Perfection
---
People are still bitching about if that‚Äôs what your asking
---
now this is person of culture
---
Sentinel titan main here. I cannot wait for this subclass to be taken down a notch. Anyone that can make a super last that long to get 9 kills.. needs a nerf..
---
Happy Birthday!
---
you kidding? between my devour and my rifts, the only place i feel like i could be doing more is if my nova bomb tree had more than one bomb
---
Man nothing kills me in thr game 100% of the time except one thing.   I can occasionally survive the titans shoulder charge or any super. But. Thr damned handheld supernovas are insanely difficult to combat.  They always get me.  Only chance of stopping it is to kill them before they can do it. Cause once ur near them and they throw that at you.  Goodbye. Also that arc web grenade is disgusting.
---
I think it will be at least balanced if they change OEM to current wormhusk levels. Shoulder charge can be countered either with different play styles or playing the situation smart, but combined with one eye it makes it extremely hard to do so. Before one eye titans were still strong but I think other classes had the upper hand in any area outside of melee range, which makes sense.
---
Welcome to my nightmare...
---
And it was a popular twitter post about 20 hours before it was on destinyfashion
---
It‚Äôs my birthday too! Have an upvote
---
Mere seconds you say?
---
Seems im unlucky and opposite team have unlimited amount of these bounties.
---
If you really think about it, it did get nerfed.  It went from being mildly challenging to get solo and could be quite a grind.  Now achieveable in a couple of hours.  Went from seeing it sort of often but now everyone i see or play with literally has it.  So yeah still does alot of damage and shreds but with the changes to comp it leveled the playing field
---
Season of the Undying (this) plus the Next 3 I guess
---
Never explains how you make an event heroic, so it's still not straightforward. Your point is moot.
---
Its still a beast on console.  Pc not so much
---
Apparently you have to do the whole quest steps as normal then it will drop, but not 100% sure yet
---
When the game starts to die again they probably will.
---
Have you been able to unlink the incorrect blizzard account and link the correct blizzard account?
---
It tells you how to do it in the screenshot?
---
Go to Eris morn
---
Lmao, im sure over half of my kills are melee. I mean punching things is just better than using guns. You have to reload a gun afterall.... When i get the helm of saint 14 im gonna see about swapping it out to see if i like that better, we'll see though
---
Does vagisil clean the sandy vaginas too?
---
Prolly should visit Eris Morn
---
No. Youre breathtaking. Lol
---
You manipulated your armor to get as low as possible.  Stop the dumb shit. Bungie did nothing wrong here
---
Bro I got to Eris Morn EVERYDAY
---
I think you mean a Hunter with tether and tractor cannon. Roaming supers HATE me
---
Shame I can‚Äôt get the emblem in game any more same with jade rabbit emblem so annoying I can‚Äôt get them any more
---
How did you get it?
---
Someone else who loves gambit. I've found 1 now
---
Tfw your mom tells you that your adopted and your sister comes in lookin dummy thicc.

Literally nobody asked for this. 
---
An awesome guy who just felt like making it:
---
Agree. It‚Äôs a wierd map. With so many holes to hide in. I always find that I end up dead by the architects on this one.
---
Have no clue
---
That one jojo game?
---
These are people who scan the book and leave the area, the thing are still there it's a visual bug.
---
[deleted]
---
Go to the raid on the moon. Lots of vex right away all to yourself
---
Yeah, same.
---
I think the increased elemental damage plus the stupid flame targets were just stupid additions and made for too much unnecessary damage.
---
Like, you had to be moving non-stop. Not to mention the boss was a sponge. Not looking forward to doing it again.
---
To add to the other post (i am also a new light player and were able to get all these quests before i bought Forsaken pretty sure....i may be wrong on one or two though)
---
Whisper of the Worm should be available to new lighters. Whisper isnt a quest per say you just go do the dungeon on Io but still
---
Risk Runner should be, i think the quest is called Pain and gain
---
Rat King side arm is another one, for me it started on the water planet Titan i think doing the quest there
---
And 84 when masterworked.
---
I can't wait 'til I've played enough Destiny to get these jokes.
---
Dang, I've got some rookie numbers lol.
---
thanks! &lt;3
---
I have mine "stuck" on this as well. I already did it but I got another for some reason and I can not delete it either. I dont think there is anything we can do about it yet. Just gotta let it take up a quest slot until it is fixed.
---
One time I called it heroic men...
---
A seasoned veteran has to do something like this at least once in their guardian life! I think I‚Äôve killed myself with Blade Barrage or Nova Bomb on multiple occasions!
---
Truth is my backup if i need to just give a big ‚ÄúF You‚Äù to four stacks or when thunder lord isnt doing me good.
---
I doubt anyone really uses these *cough* scams *cough* I mean "services". If you're not good enough to unlock these types of weapons, you'll probably be equally terrible using these weapons
---
They did it on my Last Word top as well.
---
Personally i bought Forsaken and the Season Pass. I do plan to get Shadowkeep but still working through Forsaken stuff atm and i wanted to play the story in order.
---
Well the triumph does say ‚ÄúScore or witness a perfect round of the Tire Game on the Moon‚Äù so I guess being in the area counts as witnessing
---
Yeah my friend and I were very confused
---
You left out the patt where we kill each other for fun and the amusement of lord shaxx

Happy bday! also nice wallpaper! it's in my rotation now!

Ain't

Your mama taught you right.

Ok so the liars handshake is a world drop exotic meaning can get it everywhere. So you can pray to rnjesus for it to drop or get into the ordeal nightfalls at 950/980 light level difficulty to have an even greater chance to get it.

:: Update! ::
---
I posted this as kind of a joke, but I appreciate all the questions! Since several people were interested in my experience with the trackball, let me try to break it down a bit... First off, this trackball is called an Turbo Mouse, and it's by Kensington. They still make it, but this copy is about 15 years old. I'm a video editor, and it's great for that. Kensington provides software that lets you map the buttons to complex keyboard inputs, so it's great for speeding up work in Premiere Pro.
---
All that said, my experience with it as a gaming input is very different. This thing is pretty bad for D2, but not really for the reasons I expected. I was anticipating that the trackball would make it hard to control where you're aiming, and that it would be hard to adjust to the difference in keybinds since the physical location of the buttons is very different. Turns out the trackball wasn't all that bad. I'm a hunter main, and after a few public events I could get (pretty much) consistent crits while doing my jumpy boi thing. The problem with this device for gaming is in the buttons. They have much heavier switches than a normal mouse button, and the throw is much longer. I've never noticed it while editing, but when you're in the middle of Warsat Down and that wave of thrall comes down the hill, it's really hard to keep up. It feels like running a race with training weights on. It's possible that current models of the trackball have lighter buttons, I'd be curious to hear from other people with newer copies.
---
I played for about 90 minutes, got a few season levels, definitely not a wasted night. But it did get me thinking about my setup, and I'd love to hear what y'all are playing with. I have a Logitech G300s, and in Shadowkeep, here are [my keybinds](https://imgur.com/a/zY6WVhg). I know it's not a very expensive mouse, but it's one of the few mice with 6 programmable buttons plus click and right-click, and my left had is way too clumsy to be trusted with anything more than WASDF. :D
---
Thanks for reading all that, I welcome any suggestions for keybinds/whatever to make my play better. See you on the moon!
---
It‚Äôs also the birthday of u/norsefenris
---
Happy birthday fellow guardian ü§òüèæ
---
Can confirm that you have to do the 4 invader kills when at that specific quest step. However I‚Äôve just invaded and wiped the team again  whilst on the step so happy days lol. Sorry to whoever it was I did it to though (whoever you are) It was a meatball primevil so I feel bad lol
---
Bungie is a bit thick though, Plus it‚Äôs a pretty stupid way to ‚Äòintroduce‚Äô players to the game.
---
Which content do you want to use it for?pvp
---
Or pve?
---
Well In fact for both pve and pvp ,this roll is apparently far from a god roll
---
I mean I prefer my precision high damage weapons to require precision rather than just holding the trigger aiming at their dicks, but sure
---
Nice try you sneaky Hunter you, a true Titan would never speak such words.
---
yeap, recovery is always the way to go, on any class imo.
---
need cutscene now bungo
---
Aww. I wanted to use it for both.
---
Sure do what you like. It just seems pointless.
---
I believe it increase the armor but since he got damaged from gravity not gunshots and all 3 -almost- had the same health before recovery kicks in I think the test looks correct.
---
That's what I post everytime cause if you take a post like that seriously, I can tell I'm not gonna enjoy playing with you. Raids arent hard, most dont even need comms.
---
Yeah definitely don't spend anything on armor right now, even infusing is a waste of materials till you're really high up unless you get the "same item discount" and can do it for glimmer.
---
Masterworking a weapon is less risky, so don't hold back on that if you get a really great weapon roll.
---
Well, the vex struggle with simulating the paracausal, so it isn‚Äôt likely.
---
Yes, i noticed that too..it kinda trickles up when im in an empowering rift. But, its inconsistent because some time if gives me a full chunk of super energy. Also, ehroar has a video about stacking mods, and he's getting a chunk of energy when using class abilities.
---
Exactly!  Everybody jokes around how Titans are shotgun apes, but I‚Äôd rather have a titan charge me with a shotgun over the Hunters who spend the whole match sitting crouched around the corner with one.
---
Ayyye a fellow Hot ones fan :D lmao
---
I mean sure, but it's not just "waaaaah bungie rng pls" if you actually stop whining it works out well for farming better stat rolls and elemental affinities. But anyway, what do I know, feel free to keep complaining about it. And technically he is also right because if you don't have the helmet prior to getting chest, it does only drop from the final boss, so for the sake of you just wanting to be a smart ass, you're both correct. 
---
Do you though
---
&gt;ust better than everyone else
---
No i just tried to say that i am better than them in aiming and positioning, but they can still get me because of their extreamly good setup
---
I dont have destiny forsaken, what is gambit?
---
Well you may think that but I don‚Äôt, Anyway everyone has opinions.
---
Looks amazing.
---
That was my thought as well...but it may needed to be tested out
---
Can you double stack? :p
---
I used the crap outta Wishender in year 2. Mainly for the Hush grind... that thing annihilates taken enemies. Honestly.. bows shred nowadays.
---
Go to sunken isles on Edz. 
---
Run two lost sectors while headshotting every cabal you see in between. 
---
Damn near done in 25 minutes. 
---
Don‚Äôt run vex invasions where everyone else is fighting for crits . 
---
Not to mention cabal have easier crits imo
---
You cant play a game with people trying to win and then get mad because they use gear that gives them the best chance to win.
---
Imagine finding a lobby without shotguns must be nice
---
So I saw some pop-up that said paying players can get something from someone at the tower, but after getting to the tower I can't remember who it was and I can't find out how to see the pop-up again, any help?
---
Those people make me cry
---
Do you like it better when Lord Saladin oversees these matches? Does it look like I care??
---
Its bugged if you haven't completed the izanmi's forge quest or have picked up the questline before the launch of shadowkeep. I can confirm that I was able to get the 4th key on my lock because I had the inzami's questline before Shadowkeep.
---
Resilience is kinda trash, something like 20 extra shield at 100. Only good in pvp at certain breakpoints.

For me personally, i would consider that a near god tier roll. Zen moment is highly underrated. A lot of people have fallen to my zen moment Last Perdition.
---
I was farming 920 nightfall yesterday and had 2 exotics drop during my runs....about 10 runs. They weren't engrams though. Just random exotic drops. I think that's how they drop now but I'm not 100% sure. They were both duplicate of exotics I've already acquired as well.
---
So, I died to a guardian with 0 light in crucible, that was fun
---
&gt; I mean sure

Thanks.

Nice info.

I don‚Äôt think so, should‚Äôve put Dune Marchers on the other one lol

Happy b-day guardian. Thanks for the wp.
---
Just a player
---
cool will do
---
Steam is wonderfull 
---
Currently I'm named A Vexual Predator.
---
If you play PC you've probably destroyed me in crucible a number of times.
---
Maybe not a god roll, but a solid roll.
---
My favorite part is that those three words are the only thing he got from that üòÅ
---
THE ENEMY CANT KILL IF THEYRE DEAD
---
ok, now this is logical, and actually supports my idea, because with what you mentioned right now, the old argument is actually invalid, because now it is a Striker using some weapon got more damage than Celestial Nighthawk using some weapon, before, the argument was top tree stricker is a good pve endgame subclass that a stricker with 2 nades can put more damage on riven the celestial Nighthawk, but now everything is different,  which take us back to the idea that titan's arc subclasses are shit for pve ENDGAME, it is usable but it is shit compared to any other thing.
---
your argument was
---
 "My buddy did 2 man riven and his pulse nades out damaged a celestial (he does pve/pvp recovs). Nothing wrong with top tree striker for pve, I use it as reaper in gambit prime, it rocks (approaching 32nd infamy reset)"
---
I didn‚Äôt say I thought that, I explained why it is pointless with factual information. But people can do what they want
---
It‚Äôs only the fatebringer of Destiny two, destroying the pve meta, ya know
---
TiTaN's OeM bAD...ThIS GoOd
---
Great! Ready for Iron Banner.
---
Nope, literally all red bars unless you start the encounter
---
Happy Birthday
---
Is a well even necessary there
---
Banshee (the weaponsmith). He has the new exotic quest for *\*spoiler:* &gt;!Leviathan's Breath (the new exotic heavy bow)!&lt;
---
The Mindbender too, apparently
---
That‚Äôs one of the problem with gambit
---
No one takes out the blockers and when the people who collect go to bank, the others rarely come in to support them
---
Also when the enemy team invades, they just don‚Äôt care, they‚Äôll just keep on clearing ads and collecting notes smh
---
Dude fuck off. People of all types are allowed to play a fucking video game you mong
---
Good guy Mithrax
---
What is this supposed to mean?
---
I never said anything about the vex simulating the light
---
It was heavy but it wasn't ammo lol
---
Blast furnace is such a great rifle.
---
I love zen moment on pulses, esp blast furnace, because they just turn into laser beams.
---
I prefer rampage for PvE ad control, but personally prefer kill clip for PvP as I can proc and use it more often. With that said, nothing is more clutch than having rampage proc if you get the first kill with your first few bursts and don't have to reload for kill 2.
---
Personally i have a feeding frenzy rampage with a range mw and i love it. Was going for ff kill clip but i settled with that. Still use it in pvp and pve
---
Even one or two are hard to manage in my head, tryna maintain knowledge of where they are
---
Ok
---
Dang I wish the old way still worked. It didn't give dupes until you already had the complete set.
---
I'll watch, but my hourly rate is 235USD with a half hour MSC.
---
Nolan Cayde wasn't even that good. I'm glad they killed him rather than having him voiced by Nolan tbh
---
New ps app background pic u/Levirei also, happy birthday
---
Bruhhh I'm aight
---
I literally just got another one today what the fuck. Random drop after pvp match
---
Rapid hit is 1:1 a better perk. It provides the benefit of outlaw without requiring a kill, and is basically zen moment as well with the increased stability. 
---
As far as which gun you prefer that could come down to the other stats. One might have better range or handling that will make it feel snappier or more consistamt
---
When I get worked over I pop the applaud emote. Not much says gg as well as applauding your killer as you are resurrected.
---
I don't see skullfort as competitive, I'd expect that; people can still run shoulder charge trees without it, with either hammers or shield, too
---
Had to google what Zero Hour was as seen it mentioned a few times. Like I said, returning player so alot to catch up on!
---
Hilarious.
---
Yup, it's not as bad as destiny 1 though. Destiny 1, you could spot the Titan mains a mile away.

You forget top tier waifu Oryx.

Please take the time to read our subreddit's rules. This is the fourth post of yours this week we've had to remove due to violating multiple rules.
---
Seems pointless
---
Sparkson, is that you?
---
I hear ya man. Jobs are stupid
---
I bought the season pass and I seem to have access to everything except the campaigns from the last two dlcs. I still have access to the Moon and the reef locations, and I can still get armor and weapons from the last two dlcs I just can't directly buy them. I believe I also don't have access to the raids from the last two dlcs? But I still have a bunch of other raids to do first anyway. Id say for now the $10 pass is the cheapest way, and they'll probably make the dlc cheaper later.
---
Ahh gotcha, thank you.
---
time to die!
---
Happy Birthday!!!
---
Has I have not post this since now
---
YOU‚ÄôRE IN THE BULLETS WAY
---
Are you referenceing warframe slova?
---
Have you played siege? They're everywhere
---
Sorry just looked sorry
---
There's currently 4 planned seasons for shadowkeep including the current Season of the Undying, so with digital deluxe you'll already have the season pass for when that season starts. Otherwise when this season ends and Season of the Whatevermcguffin starts, you'll have to buy another season pass for around $10USD. So you ultimately save 10 bucks or so by going with the digital deluxe if you plan on playing Destiny for the next year or at least coming back to it for each of those seasons.
---
Why not show a video of it in action?
---
Nope, not all of us.
---
Against weaker enemies, I'd rather go for outlaw since I only need to land a single headshot for it, with rapid hit you have to land multiple headshots to get the full effect
---
Yeah. I‚Äôve never done a raid either because of work also
---
And I clearly said that makes then a new player
---
Try bottom tree with sticky nades. Tons of fun
---
I modeled the face and hair, and rigged the models, u/TheJudSub ripped the armor. He owns a model rip community for fan artists to make cool stuff :)

There isn‚Äôt really any reason why city Guardians would fight each other out in the wilds. Sure, they have different factions and allegiances, but we‚Äôre all fighting on the same side.

Yes I too watched the video
---
Oh wow ok thanks
---
What‚Äôs the mw?

That still doesn't answer the question about why easy anti cheat is only available for D2 when using linux .
---
Also stop with the extreme ethos argument and virtue signaling. Nobody says anything about kicking players during encounters.
---
Took me roughly 75 bounties at 5 a week. I had been trying to get one basically since people figured it out in BA. Took a few month break and then started up again in SK.
---
This shit made me laugh.
---
I don‚Äôt think there are many enemies that are going to die in one shot from a pulse rifle, most are going to die in 2-3 which will give you the full effect if they‚Äôre all crits as most weapons hit the reload speed cap before you max out rapid hit. A single burst of the pulse has the potential to proc rapid hit x4 Also rapid hit has a zen moment-esque effect of increased stability which makes it even easier to land consecutive crits
---
honestly Nolan was good in the Last Stand cinematic, I didn't even realize it was Nolan and not Nathan
---
Lmao am only too
---
Usually it's just me and my friend but he ragequits alot which leaves me alone
---
You're definitely right. Shoulder charge and Jotunn aren't competitive. I still dragged them with me to 5500 through a slog of recluse + sniper/mountaintop + bottom striker/Dawnblade + oem
---
Now just to do it two more times for unbroken lol
---
So... crimson but bullets that do less damage and no heals.
---
Overall I would say the idea is promising, especially the design and description, but the perks would need to be spruced up a lot
---
*Nice!*
---
Yeah usually It‚Äôs just me and my cousin playing but we never manage to get more people
---
That‚Äôs fucked. Rebuff Lunafaction. If they‚Äôre gonna have One Eyed and An Insurmountable Skullfort, warlocks should have at least something to compete.
---
I had to watch it twice because my mind just couldn‚Äôt comprehend how you just annihilated an entire team with leviathans breath (just got it last night and went to bed after I got it, I work too much lol)
---
Reload speed! xD
---
You forgot to include the purple homing-orb rocket launcher, Deathbringer or something.
---
Sadly no. It's a Nether Star

Let's play some crucible after.  Leave your mobility low and..... please be on the other team.  /s

I thought people gave you gifts on your birthday, not the other way around.... Happy birthday! And thanks for the sick wallpaper

This is my new favorite thing

It is really good at keeping the tank full of grenade and melee energy IMO....hope u like it!
---
Once you get 4 kills it pulls you back.
---
Who says that it isn't good?
---
People are the same, it's just an observer bias. Your bias.

Has anyone here ever bought a package like that? If that's you, then you should be ashamed for losing your chance to feel pride and accomplishment.. but really how did y'all feel after you bought it

Synthoceps ftw, just got them last night from.... something. They popped up in the middle of a crucible match haha. But I've laid the beatdown on so many dudes. Mayhem+bubble+Synthoceps

Ahhhhhh, Scotland!! Where the men are men, the nights are cold, and the sheep are afraid. ‚úå
---
There's one on the server
---
I'm sure thats why he lost the gunfight after...pure rage
---
Was talking about goblins/hobgoblins the crit spot has been broken for a while now
---
Ikr?! Last night I did Gambit Prime for my last match for powerful gear, and we had a great start. Got up to 40-60 points within the first 5 minutes iirc and they're stuck at 17? We were generally matched on mote pickup for white bar but they tossed a captain at us prior and we sent a few blockers afterwards. So after the first batch we get enough to send 1-2 captains and a goblin over to keep them locked down and barely any time passes before we've somehow instantly lost 40 points, they shot up to 65 and we're stuck with Taken Knights out the wazoo and by the time we manage to chew through those stupid things they're at 95. I wish I recorded that because they literally pulled an Uno reverse card on us and won. At least the Primeval struggle was mostly even when we finally caught up, but they had better invasions and bursted it down faster.
---
God damn
---
Literally me last night
---
I always give people the benefit of the doubt but I can‚Äôt tel you how many reckoning tier 3 runs I‚Äôve had ruined by a titan teammate who just punches everything. Then I revive them and they proceed to punch everything and die again. 
---
Mistakes happen, but if you keep doing the same dumb strategy over and over and over again expecting it to work out differently you‚Äôre just being an idiot
---
Just delete them.
---
&gt;Tons of vex. 
---
Yes that's the problem, Cabal are the easier and quicker enemy to kill with a bow because the vex crit spots are busted
---
I prefer Prime to regular Gambit, I need Malfeasance tho
---
My order " did not pass quality control standards" so it wont ship until November.
---
Several people I've heard say its trash due to DPS and overlapping abilities, especially with the staggering feature. Ehroar made a whole video trashing the weapon, and frankly I got kind of mad, cause he only looked at it from a "power weapon=damage" standpoint, which is not what the weapon is for.
---
He also said that the draw time is too slow to be used against other guardians, a d this clip shoots that down real fast
---
Trust me it doesn't, oathkeeps let you keep the poison shot infinitely
---
Protip: don‚Äôt Use bungie.net, use the destiny2lfg discord. People there are way less salty and there are way more people there too.
---
Someone had "Registered Vex Offender."
---
I hope that was the same one who said here they had it before but Bungie made them change it.
---
I‚Äôm confused. The cutscene of Zavala waking up and making it to the city he was bald. He got the armor after that cutscene/expedition.
---
That's how Titans who use OEM in crucible are
---
Any sniper rifle with hipfire
---
He deserves it you should never single blade barrage if it‚Äôs a 1v1 unless it‚Äôs to stop a super
---
doing that but picture makes no sense
---
Fair enough. My apologies.
---
Better than getting crossmapped by enemy supers that are hitscan and have max stats
---
Thank you guardian! Happy birthday by the way üéâüéä
---
I‚Äôve done this exact thing hahaha. Only before Leviathans breath. Did it with my subtle calamity
---
And models and basically any assets
---
I hate guys who solo barrage.
---
It is
---
You just notice it when titan do, and don't point out when other 2 classes do it, it's just a normal thing, but every time a titan dies you proclaim in your head "again the god damn titan", dude, it's you.
---
Happy born on date!
---
You do. In regular Gambit, when you die with motes, they are lost forever, y'all will have to collect new motes. In Prime, if you have on enough Collector pieces to get the perk, you can drop some of your lost motes when killed, allowing your team to recover a little bit of the loss.
---
Main points for reviving a downed teammate:
---
1. If the Invader is hella good, takes their aim to someone without motes so you can protect anyone with motes.
---
2. If you have Primeval up, allows your team to continue DPSing the boss / fight back the Invader.
---
3. The rez will keep the downed teammate within easy access to the fight. It's a bit of an annoyance to run back from spawn to get into the fight.
---
4. Extra bit of shielding when you rez a teammate can mean the difference between a one-hit kill and a shot that hurts hella bad but you can escape to safety.
---
Fair I assumed this was for the heavy bow quest
---
..."right now?"
---
Reposted it as a shorter video
---
I feel personally attacked
---
I don't understand the issue. If both people exist, just join the ones you are comfortable playing with. Why hate on someone who as already put the hours in to learn the fight and doesn't want to sacrifice more time to teach others?
---
NO!!1 RED CRAYON BETTERERE, MAKE TITAN STRONG BOY, PUNCH BAD MAN HARDER SO HE DIE MORE!
---
Only trash players that can‚Äôt win 1v1 gun fights do it
---
Holy shit. Wasn't expecting that
---
True, but what if I'm a Dredgen, or followed the Drifter?
---
Holy shit I need this bow
---
I hear ya....I have never been a huge fan of the Void class either. But that was why I did those Builds honestly, to sort of come up with ways to get it to work with my play style. But I have been a Solar or Arc Warlock mostly in Destiny lol. That Monte Carlo is pretty good huh?
---
RNG. Just bad luck. It really sucks when that happens. Keep doing your best and try different forges.
---
How recently have you tried? They disabled it for about 2 weeks a little bit ago because of bugs
---
If he deleted everything else his drops would be based on the low pieces
---
Ayyy warlock
---
Well yes, your aim assist value improves with ADS. 
---
Meaning better bullet magnetism, increasing hit chance.
---
Any hunter who solo blade barrages like that deserves it.
---
I'm a hunter main, and the amount of people who waste blade barrages is just ridiculous. It's like mayhem trained them to just use it whenever, and they cant think strategically at all.
---
Get yourself The Last Word.
---
**Combattaint**
---
That was his nephew
---
That last one. Man, it's like that one dude just has all the luck getting away with his 15 motes. I know he's cackling, I do when I manage to evade the Invader.
---
Thanks. Good luck
---
I see hunters and warlocks do it too, but incredibly rarely. Normally when they‚Äôre idiots I revive them and they still being stupid, the same will happen with most titans but some titans just keep trying. And as I‚Äôve already said the vast majority of titans are fine, that fact I‚Äôve already said this and you‚Äôre accusing me of thinking titans are dumb every single time a titan dies seems like you‚Äôre just an offended titan main, and instead of looking what I‚Äôm actually saying you‚Äôre just reading ‚Äútitan dumb‚Äù
---
The 3 bosses rotate weekly. I think Arunak was last week, so in 2 more he'll be back
---
Nice
---
Deathbringer may finally make the maximum carnage medal (7) a bit easier to reach.
---
Dang lol at least give us a sparrow
---
i was probably the worst person to come across in d1 because of my peruns fire.  it was kind of stupid.
---
I‚Äôll correct it
---
I'm not sure about playerbase at large but the crucible numbers come out to about 2x hunters to anything else. I had this discussion on Reddit and we all looked at our thing that tells us crucible kills, and almost everyone had 2x hunter kills. Last time I checked I had roughly 2000 titan kills 1900 warlock kills and 4000 hunter kills.
---
Warlocks have a really balanced neutral game but their bottom tree dawnblade is broke as fuck. Which is why it's getting nerfed.... Or already has been.
---
Hunters are like... Eh. The middle tree void is fucking nutty in the neutral game and the super is good, but outside of that they have a fairly mediocre neutral game on every other tree.
---
Eris kinda bangin tho
---
Geez lol
---
Exiting Banshees secret shop in the tower. You can access it through a spot in the hangar and work your way through. It‚Äôs part of the quest to get the new Leviathan‚Äôs Breath exotic bow that you can get if you own the season of the Undying.

Is it on your invoice/receipt?

Did you check inside the box?
---
Does the store page give any details?

I don‚Äôt recommend Trinity Ghoul, the splash damage kills don‚Äôt count towards precision kills.
---
I think I'm going to go back to destiny 1. Apparently there are still people playing it.
---
It‚Äôs entirely subjective in your end, you‚Äôre wrong. OEM has been broken for months on end.
---
Blueberries like you don‚Äôt seem to fully understand the Crucible Economy on how certain items work.
---
It‚Äôs an extreme over exaggeration of reality, if you join an LFG that specifies KWTD and you don‚Äôt you have nobody to blame but yourself for getting kicked, also don‚Äôt waste my time with condescention.
---
If only I could get both Explosive and rampage
---
You sure can.

In castelum the majority of the infinite spawning enemies are red bar so long as you don‚Äôt make any progress in the encounter.

I didn¬¥t get to know Cayde that much, but right now I think I feel something similar with Drifter
---
Doing the lord's work, you are!
---
I'm just confused on Destiny 2. D1 was simple.
---
So its basically 100 or nothing.
---
The new matchmaking system matches based on a new skill system, not your glory rank. That's why so many people can make it to legend that couldn't before.
---
Wait this is actually big brain. During Red War he was travelling between time loops on Nessus so he could have ended up here for a long time wouldn¬¥t he?
---
Hunter seasonal track ornaments
---
Could be a recovery. Comp doesn‚Äôt go by glory it goes by skill and bungies ‚Äúinternal skill rating‚Äù. I‚Äôm at 5500 and played someone with 200 glory and he was pretty good. He could‚Äôve just started playing comp again too.
---
I'm not getting the catalyst lol
---
as someone who doesn't play crucible, does the perk/mark persist after the titan has been killed? I don't see why you don't just gun the guy down before he can hit you... (tried playing crucible in d1, and just died a lot)
---
*deposits one mote *
---
Hunters can do that too
---
He was talking about shoulder charge
---
Your forgetting that NINE guardians got killed in that one raid on titan, y'know the one with the crystals. I dont think all guardians are nearly close to god killing levels.
---
Boop!
---
Just do what I do bud, get the first 6%-8% you can do it solo as it‚Äôs all the jumping puzzle bit the  last bit you need to fight adds though, there‚Äôs guides on YouTube
---
Well that's the point of this meme I guess, ideally you kill the masked Titan, bc otherwise they've got walls and it makes the job a lot harder
---
Oh, well you‚Äôre not gonna have much luck I think. 
---
The approach to weapons in Destiny is miles removed from CoD.  
---
Every weapon drop feels different because of random rolls. You‚Äôre just gonna have to try whatever drops for you.
---
Your not wrong that you definitely have to support your team but you‚Äôre wrong if you think letting one brash team mate dictate tactics and rush at the enemy over and over again is a winning strat. 
---
Sure you have to push sometimes, and sometimes you have to be patient. I‚Äôm not advocating for camping but not rushing in with a shotgun against a team of 3 with a better position, or fusions, or running out in the open against snipers is the right call.
---
true lmao
---
*pulls sparrow with malicious intent*
---
The one time I don‚Äôt have a bow
---
jUsT oUTplAy iT iT‚Äôs BaLAncEd
---
Jesus,  your a grinder lol
---
I mean, I think the bow is good and definitely tons of fun but this play is 100% bad positioning by the enemy team and a well placed tether. Couldn't you do this with just about any heavy weapon or sniper?
---
Couldn't find anything in the box or on the page.
---
Pillager, the Gambit SMG
---
I love Destiny2, it's so chill and easy to have fun.  I love to hang out on Titan for hours, making noobs cry by punting the event chests into the ocean. XD  I'm always looking for someone to hang and chat with while doing so.  Send me a friend request.  I'm an all around fun guy, and with so many new players joining the game it's just so hilarious messing with them.
---
Imagine trying to carry your friends in vex offensive lol. If you need help with it message me.
---
Exotic quest, go visit banshee
---

---
It was just the one haha
---
I knew it only a OEM striker Titan would post this üòÇüòÇ
---
I always report teabaggers for abusive chat.
---
Its an overcomplicated method but if you use DIM you can pull things from one inventory to another and claim postmaster stuff. If I were you I'd try and keep at least 1 space on each slot free so you can claim items you missed and trash them if they suck.
---
Yeah I got a ps4.
---
no
---
I'd definitely recommend it. You don't necessarily need the dlcs to have a good time in the game-- there's plenty to do and explore!
---
Wrong, Siva was DISCOVERED by humans
---
I found the bow precision kills so easy, and the hand cannon. The real struggle now Telesto has been disabled is getting Fusion Multikills.
---
I'm having the same problem. killed all ads, blue door, sound effect and still won't open.
---
Lol that won‚Äôt do anything
---
Meh, I‚Äôve never used it but I can understand and value it‚Äôs practical application. It just seems like a reasonable quality of life update to ask for.
---
You get the quest from ikora check the quest tab maybe u didn't notice it but you need to kill 3 vex invasion bosses and kill a bunch of vex
---
That makes sense. Most opponents, in general, were either playing medium range or trying to shotgun. The ability to disengage becomes much more important when in hand cannon/shotgun range. With scout rifles, it doesn't really matter as much as just shooting them without range dropoff.
---
Looks like cabbage to me. I like cabbage.

The answer is Yes

You stopping to deposit motes before jumping in was orgasmic

Man, Gambit got a *lot* more dangerous with the addition of Ninjas in Shadowkeep
---
Ouch. What happened?
---
I fr have seen ‚Äúget recluse for $300‚Äù ads before on destiny sites. I feel thats not only stupid but removes the point of getting the gun.
---
Beat me to it

Someone did this to me on the moon while I was doing the tire game. Feelsbadman.
---
What‚Äôs an lfg
---
Ho-lee shnickels...
---
See? No one ever expects the offensive tether
---
&gt; yes it‚Äôs chaining is strong (and getting nerfed rightfully so, along with bottom striker) bit what else does it offer
---
The fastest movement speed of any super and extremely generous tracking on projectiles? Please do not pretend that bottom tree Dawnblade is not one of the best supers in PvP.
---
So in other words this still hasnt been fixed ? (I've had this issue the last two seasons)
---
You can't really farm exotics, but I've heard gambit and strikes have higher drop chances
---
do they turn pink when they kill you?
---
I used to use an AMD Radeon 7870 HD 2GB of  Vram, it sadly died during my playtime on Destiny, and thus it had to be put to pasture, So i had to go back to my Gforce 740 SC 4GB.  
---
I used to get like 60 FPS now i get between 9 and 25...  
---
I have to use the 740 until i get the 970 i have lined up, hopefully saturday i get it, or else i'm fucking breaking this 740...
---
Wouldn‚Äôt work on d2 on console, at 72 fov it still struggles to stay at 30fps and some activities can‚Äôt handle 30 fps, like doing more than 2 phases on the last boss I‚Äôm GoS. Bungie can‚Äôt do anything about console fov, it‚Äôs the hardware on consoles that‚Äôs holding it back
---
The Colony is what you want. That's as close as your gonna get.
---
STOP YELLING. Exotics can drop from anywhere. Gambit, strikes, crucible, menagerie, the vex thing shit loot so go hog wild
---
thanks still kinda new just ran with a 920 friend for a while and got some stuff
