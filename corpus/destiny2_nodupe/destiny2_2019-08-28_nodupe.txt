yeah they get cocky and you already know they are coming

(Knuckles "OH NO" here)

Thats kinda what I figured.  I do like this game and have been with it since original launch but a lot of the end game content just confuses me and when there's no story involved it's hard for me to push through. Im big on story content for most games.
---
You poor soul...
---
Helpful Tip:
---

---
When doing the Heroic for the "Destroy the Gate Lord" public event, LET THE GATE LORD LIVE UNTIL AFTER REMOVING HIS SHIELD TWICE.
---
I've seen the public event REACH Heroic multiple times, but the event turns back to a normal public event if the Gate Lord dies before its shield disappears a 2nd time. 
---
So to fix this, you'll need to do the process you did before which is eliminating the Gatekeepers at one side. Depends on which side you finished first (iirc). Then, HOLD BACK instead of going all Rambo or whatever because you can kill it before it brings its shield back up again but that's exactly what'll set the public event back to normal instead of heroic. Take out the 2nd Gatekeeper and take out the Gate Lord's shield a 2nd time, and then is when you can blow it to hell.
---
What? CryoPods can go heroic? /s

Except OEM is like wearing several exotics at once.
---
Just PvE, mostly. PvP is more based on the meta than anything else, since power level advantages are ignored for quickplay and rumble and the rotating playlist
---
*skill*
---
Ah okay. Thank you!
---
Im getting some kind of never-before discovered skin condition just by looking at this.
---
I guess you are right!  I've actually never tried my own 'strategy' ...
---
oh, and I do agree with your post in the first place
---
You’ve checked all your bounties and the tower to see if you need to talk to someone etc?
---
You are a good man. Thank you.
---
Better off buying the 10$ pack for the bigger bonus
---
Absolutely amazing, Especially the D1 Parts
---
Me and my friend have tried getting them started the past few days with no luck..we got maybe one other guy to join us while everyone else just sorta stared
---
What’s the fun in winning if it’s not a contest?
---
&gt; it should be something that you want to do instead of being just another chore
---
Exactly. Anytime I bring this up though people just downvote, or point to another game that is even more of a grind and say it's not that bad compared to that.
---
Rampage kept stacking also. Rampage basically gives extra range to shotguns.
---
You got greedy bro. Let that recovery kick in.
---
It's also farmeable from the Menagerie, pick range masterwork, almost half of its perks are perfectly good for PVP
---
Is it for this week?
---
You have to get the fallen transponder and do all the quest steps for that. Then you have to meet up with the fallen captain at the farm. The zero hour mission is only hard if you don’t know your way around the maze. Just get an experienced fire team and you’ll be fine.
---
I’ve got hundreds of hours in this game and didn’t even know you could do that for the Gate Lord on Mercury.
---
Yep. Don’t have to open chest, comes as a drop from boss
---
I get stuck with hunters who all feel the need to run blade barrage when there’s no tether or well or bubble
---
Damn he sets up fast
---
This guy insomnias
---
great idea OP
---
I can’t believe I spent money on this game and now it’s free to play
---
I love how Ikora knows he’s gonna get himself killed immediately and blinks him into Zavala’s bubble
---
What community event?
---
The fact that you can do this but trip mine grenades aren’t a OHK is stupid
---
Yea and my striker slams are “tactical” as well
---
I was really hoping for a cabal drop pod style death when the blazing gong landed on ya...a bit dissapointed no killed by the architects.
---
To be FAIR!
---
Oem is one of the least fun exotics in my opinion 
---
Like yea if I go into comp and I want to win I’m gonna use it but in quickplay there’s so much more fun to be had
---
I didn't deal with it at release, but since that last dlc OR so, my experience has been similar, or they rather just solo it. Which is just as lame when wanting to play with others
---
I thought the taken blight heroic was just random. /s
---
Uh, check the front page.
---
What buff?
---
Also, just wanted to say man...
---
That’s what I appreciates about you
---
At that range, when you land a headshot, Chappie can definitely kill.
---
On console.
---
They're not unfair, if you actually learn how to respond to them, that's  my whole point. It's just like saying having to breathe constantly is unfair, but not really if you just learn how to keep doing it.
---
Probably seems that way bc of the increased fov
---
could rather ban cry babies who can't get heavy for themselves
---
No answer then lmao
---
So you work 7 days a week, 10 hours a day? Situations that are comparable to that are the only situations where I would see someone not even completing one set of SoH armor.
---
everyone is at fault here, warlock didnt know to look out for the debris, i was too stubborn and just kept trying to pass the relic and the unbroken hunter wasnt even paying attention because it was taking so damn long
---
overall just ended up as 1 big chaotic mess
---
Please sticky something like this October. Possibly a compilation of other useful threads would be great for all our sakes.
---
What is max light right now without any expansions?
---
The music on the first death is perfect, like some spooky ghost killed you
---
Are you the same guy complaining that golden gun doesnt have damage reduction in every single post? Or is there an invasion of idiots complaining about it?
---
I definitely feel this as a primarily solo player, luckily they are adding the solo playlist in Shadow Keep. 3 or 4 in a row would be enough for me to call it a night, a literal 7 is crazy.
---
Have I complained about my ability to use them? No. They are not rewarding. They do not require any thought or skill. It’s boring shooting in the general direction of someone and being rewarded as if you’ve earned a kill. 
---
Nice article, tool. You must be the best gamer ever.
---
Rift generator was the last one I ever figured out. So unintuitive.
---
Obligatory upvote on this, definitely a lot of new people DPSing as hard as possible on some of the events like the Walker.
---
&gt; Bungie could have the matchmaking against stacks super nasty
---
Bungie could also have taken an approach that looks less like, "finish the Tour Du France and you get to use an e-assist bike next time!  Finish in the top 10 and it's 10% better!".
---
No, some people however, have things like family members, lovers, friends, hobbies, etc. you can’t expect every player to dedicate more time to the game then a Swiss watchmaker does to his work. Some people just want shiny armor dude.
---
I used Le Monarque to do Hush quest I guess?
---
All you need is a purple ball
---
And what makes you think Bungie care or read this sub? It'll be back in a future Nostalgia Engram or storefront in a different season,  why such a fuss over an insignificant sparrow? There are more pressing issues than this but you can't seem to let it go.
---
I wonder if this means the PS4 strike is coming to other platforms? We know Wavesplitter is coming to PS4/PC soon. How can they have cross save but some gear is locked to a certain platform?
---
It's not really shown anywhere on your screen. I just know from going through the game for 3 characters it gets more powerful as the story goes. So after earth its titan, then nessus, Io, mercury, Mars, tangled sore and the dreaming city
---
What set is that? Pardon my dumb.
---
Wrong subreddit.
---
I thought the blight was RNG based...
---
nope! you probably had nearby guardians spamming Wardcliffs into it to break it.
---
Iron Banner year 1 ornaments
---
Hahaha cheers for the heads up, tho a challenge on patrol might be fun
---
If you hit 2100 then just play another game and if you win or lose it will give it to you it’s something weird with the way the game recognizes u hit fabled
---
Wait until shadowkeep like 1 or 2 month away when everyone gets boosted to 750 lol
---
It's really not hard to level up now with like 50 powerful rewards a week just about
---
Ok thanks
---
YOU CAN SOCIALIZE BY MURDERING OPPOSING GUARDIANS IN THE CRUCIBLE
---
Just tone down invasions.
---
It's a natural reaction for us Gunslinger Hunters.
---
You will but it won't transfer DLC to the new platform (in your case PC). I.e. If you have forsaken on PS4, when you jump on destiny on PC, you'll be able to enter the dreaming city, but won't be able to do any forsaken stuff, such as the shattered throne
---
Nezarec's sin, telesto and swarm of the raven or hammerhead work extremely well together.
---
That's a Titan drawing if ever Ive seen one.
---
If I need to be completely honest here, the fact that you’re more into PvE and Story gameplay is almost reason enough to get Forsaken.
---
Forsaken is to date the best Storyline I’ve played in D2 and the content it introduced has been my favourite so far. It’s what restored my faith in D2 after Osiris.
---
I do say the same thing about ant good gun or exotic.
---
How did you get this footage of me lol?
---
It’s exclusive that’s why
---
Realy 30+run. Then i must have been Lucky beacuse i got it on my first powerful frame
---
Barley anyone seems to know about Taken Blight heroic. Most of the time im the only one in the public event trying to activate it correctly
---
Ah man and it's not on spotify
---
Me: nerf shotguns 
---
Bungie: bot gonna happen bitch boy
---
I’d love to check it out
---
This is the question I've been asking shotgun apes for 3 seasons now.
---
For the love of God, have this pinned at the top when New Light goes live.
---
Has you try to look for Sherpa on discord?  I find the people there very helpful and patient with newbies.  Did all the raid with the help from kind Sherpa.  Still no anarchy or 1k voice, but at least tried the raids
---
Would it kill you to mention if you play on PC or console? The metas for those 2 platformes are completely different. I can just give you the meta for pc right now, and if you're a console player then guess what? You'll just get shafted
---
I don't know what a recluse is. Shows how much I care about the sweaty side of the game. Sweats gunna sweat
---
Dont encourage that toxic loadout. Instead recommended something that actually requires skill.
---
The third tier is on the central rig part between the lander’s legs at chest height. It’s a single weak point that opens up. For keeping alive, just go for one tier each time and try to put the lander between the cabal and yourself.
---
Crimson: hold my beer
---
Whether we wanted it or not, cayde has died, and I will make no effort to avenge him.
---
If you’re going to play D2 a bunch then yes. You get lots of really good weapons, and it expands the endgame a ton.
---
Could have done with this yesterday when I was trying to figure out how to heroic the cryo-freeze event! People just kept burning him down before I could figure out what to do.
---
Thanks, I’ll give it a look as it’s on sale right now
---
This is why I always comfort the colonel every time I get the chance. It must be lonely for him sometimes
---
Oof , man I'm Soo behind in the exotic quests I haven't been able to try for pinnacle weapons
---
Still confuses me how people who have been here since day 1 still don't know how to do the Taken Blight public event
---
Nice
---
You do
---
This is a good sp. Have my updoot.
---
If you get army of one you get sniper
---
50 motes = spare rations
---
Invader killed in first 5 secs or lots of blockers killed = shotgun
---
Can't remember for scout or smg
---
Well then a big OOF for me. I did a lot of 4 Man Invasion. Get rarely a Coin or the sniper
---
Why Latin?

I dont even remember what it did in d1 are you sure your not thinking of the ram tho?
---
Anyone else just instantly look at the taken blight and give it ‘that look’
---
It reads: "You, and a few other people who were dead have been brought back to Life to kill gods and shit for some reason"
---
Luke Smith already confirmed that scout, among "many things" will be buffed in October
---
And we have woken the hive
---
Just take a random sword and wait heavy, 10 kill and you are done
---
Well I know that :O
---
I just thought ab how it took a fat min to get it done so I figured might as well ask people to play w certain weapons, it helps everyone w the quest in the long run :&gt;
---
And stepped into war with the cabal on Mars.
---
And some fallen are stealing our stuff again
---
Thanks, much appreciated
---
Yes
---
Are you able to go into the tribute hall where the calus statue is? 
---
Do you have the bond of opulence? 
---
There is a gold and purple slot on the ground near the door you can interact with which opens the doors.
---
Nice ad
---
It was one hell of a bug. I ended up with like 5 Le Monarques
---
Sponsored by the Bungie gods themselves
---
Had that happen earlier multiple times throughout the match and all it took was me sneaking one banner and my team supering during the hunt for us to win by quite a margin 
---
People..... never leave the match early
---
U will be starting at 750 which is our current max power and able to play the base campaign and year one dlcs as well as all strikes PvP and gambit so you won't be behind.
---
I always check ahead of time. If we have a top tree tether, I'll run bottom tree (it actually does some solid work on the yellow bars on bridge so I can save heavy). If we have two tethers, I'll run blade barrage. If we don't have a well lock, we're fucked anyway.
---
Only the numbers were changed and team mate kills give u same amount as if it were ur own kill now
---
Why bergusia run?
---
What Glory level is this at? If it’s low Glory (below Fabled) my experience is that 4-stacks are usually at a disadvantage to a degree.
---
I feel sorry for you. I hope getting the recluse Will make it worth it
---
It’s not all that terrible
---
Seems that you should run the game pretty well, the only issue that I may foresee is the power supply, it’s kinda weak and that may cause stuttering and high power usage times. But other than that issue, which isn’t even a guarantee, I think you’ll be fine.
---
It should say "I leave when I see a 6 stack on the other team before the game starts"
---
That is so annoying. Just because 6 people are playing together doesn't mean it's an auto loss
---
Don't want to take anything away from you, clearly the better team, don't enjoy a stomp, always feel bad for the other team and there's not the excitement of fighting for every point. I was face to face with a striker titan just the other day as the clock ticked to 0 and we won by a single point, can't beat the rush of those final seconds.
---
I think after 1dt October they might sell forsaken as a seperate thing for the new light players
---
Get a rx 580 instead of that 1650, cheaper and twice as much vram.
---
Done! Thanks for help. It's funny that they ran into same afk farmers and are stuck in infinite loop of Gambit prime draw without getting any reward.
---
It's not, you're using an older board and using an iGPU instead of a dedicated GPU
---
It's hell lately, half of my attempts to join a game end up with joining ongoing farm fests where of course I'm on the short end dodging supers popping one after another lel, feels quite good to mount a come back sometimes but I wish people stopped quitting games like punk b*tches. How are they gonna git gud ?
---
So for the cpu, yes. For the graphics card? I honestly don’t know. The numbers on graphics cards can be weird sometimes. For example my gtx 970 is way better than a 1050ti or even a 1060ti
---
No OEM? You're one of the good ones! Kudos and I would definitely manly handshake you if I ever see you, fellow titan!
---
Exploders.
---
Nevermind, you're not worth the brain cells.
---
Also check u have the latest version?
---
I don't leave, but I do give up
---
Yes using a controller on PC against m&amp;k players will be putting yourself at a disadvantage, as someone who prefers playing games with a controller and dislikes m&amp;k this is one of the reasons why i personally tend to prefer console gaming rather than PC.
---
Bro is that a dominos Gaul bionicle
---
Last Wish has random rolled perks on it's armor, and there's even a chest you can get to solo each week that has a chance of dropping armor/weapons/mods.
---
Leviathan is a lot of fun, and some of the weapons are still viable so it's worth doing. Also, once Shadowkeep releases on Oct 1st, if you run Leviathan you'll get armor 2.0 drops so you can look good while still having good perks.
---
I’ve seen some people defending this on the forums not realizing that eventually it will force bungie to disable rewards for losses/failures making things much worse for everyone.
---
Imo this needs a ban, they’re not playing the game anyway. I don’t like gambit either, not one bit, but I still play it for required items. Requirements are not that bad, when they are bungie adjusts it like they did with 100 bosses thing.
---
I’ve seen 50 point swings all the time! Capture the zones guardians!!!
---
I have the one x as well and never experienced loading times this long except game installation/updates in the back or ISP problems! I don’t have an ssd. Refresh your dashboard and don’t go to power saving mode but instead let the console shut down completely when turning it off.
---
I’m the Bazaar, right hand side after you get down the steps
---
Never seens any problem about thoses, maybe 100+ isnt enought ahhaha
---
RELAX MORE!
---
Same area as ikora, just look right as you enter.
---
i got prosthetics yo
---
MOONS DEFINITELY HAUNTED
---
Complaining about weapons that don't track is probably the most redundant thing anyone could do.
---
I solo'd iron banner last night and got a perfect game we ran with the most captures against a stack of 5 clan mates. 
---
It isn't the guns..
---
I think you need annual pass for that but I may be wrong. Best you check online :p
---
"OK Google: what's the average life span of a chicken?"
---
Well it is worth doing the Leviathan if you want the Legend of Acrius exotic shotgun. There are also a couple really solid weapons. They don’t have random rolls but the rolls they have are awesome anyway.
---
but then... you're not armless...
---
See, I'm inclined to agree. However, I have been vooped from heavy on burnout while I was at A outside. Behind the pillar. Or, on vostok while I am at C spawn and they're looking at C from the cave area. So normally I agree. As well, with a 760 charge time the only weapons that can counter are other fusions or shotguns I think; at least in straight up ttk. Again, I agree with the shotgun and sniper comments but there's range and rng with fusions that can do some WACK shit.
---
so you’re fine with weapons that literally defy the laws of physics and actual space magic.
---
but someone replying to you on the internet w/o arms crossed the line
---
I mean... are you typing with your toes? Mind power? your friggin nose?
---
Interesting that you believe it a hate thread. I see a few salty replies but no real hate yet.
---
I used the atmospheric glow on my hunters opulence armor. It looks almost evil
---
The right rolls on fusions can make them pretty interesting for sure.
---
I think the behind the pillar thing is just lag though. Kinda like the infamous curving bullets.
---
Also, a big problem is the inability to challenge specials (shotgun/fusion) anywhere within their range. You can't really change that without making the game crappy. They did it in y1. It wasn't great.
---
I'll see if I can find my clip of my top tree void warlock tracking. It's really funny seeing the ball of death follow a target.
---
SkateFreak1751 hit me up. I dont mind helping you out and im in a huge clan that is always active and are always down to help.

It's a heavy weapon......of course it's going to kill you.
---
I see this as an absolute win
---
I want that skin to be a thing lol
---
It is easy to think people leave losing matches but i see just as many leaving winning ones. I honestly feel like people leave matches because life or like they finished match and forgot to leave que or something cuz they were on character screen or just went afk. This is really common in forges. lol.
---
(they're low-key good when paired with Last Word. You didn't hear it from me.)
---
I feel ya
---
I’ve stopped playing d2 for a while what armor is that hunter wearing and what are recluses
---
I mean it is still cheaper with better performance though, why not?

having to decrypt them is definitely a useless mechanic

Ah yes, you have mastered the sword logic

iron banner uses SBMM....so you are matching with those just as skilled as yourself.

thanks.  Thought it looked familiar but couldn't quite place it.

Man, this reminds me of a match I joined late, literally the score was 25-74 and as I loaded in they got the mercy rule activated, we lost the match and I got the exotic "Apotheosis Veil", my disappointment knew no bounds

So bad

Well, technically Bungie never did ways which moon...

This is why I think they shouldn't make survival the only mode that gives comp points
---
.....moons hanuted LMAOOOO XDXDXD
---
&gt;Tried googling and nothing is being helpful.
---
What sorts of search terms did you use? When I type "destiny 2 await the world eater" into google, I get pages and pages of guides. [Here is the first result.](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-01-19-destiny-2-world-eater-quest-legend-of-acricus-4747)
---
Also, when you hover over quests in your pursuits inventory, it brings up a box with a more detailed list of requirements. When you hover over this quest, does it not have an empty check box next to "Leviathan raid completed"? This is supposed to tell you that you are supposed to complete the raid called Leviathan.
---
oh, must be opposite day. Thank you.
---
Which do you like better, Revoker or Beloved (if you have it)
---
Does [the Shadowkeep and cross save FAQ stickied to this subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/by457o/faq_shadowkeep_cross_save_free_to_play_and_more/) help at all? If not, please post your question on the FAQ itself.

Can I get paired with these bots?

Switch character then back

You were at 9/12 matchmaking. I am willing to bet the moment you went into your menu you got 12/12 and started to load (travel) into the match.
---
If you get on streaks it really does not take that long.

ok ama try

Well technically you earned them so maybe come October 1st you will get 2.0

Cross save to PC. Problem solved.
---
Tips on the first boss? I'm having a hard time with it...
---
When Bungie created "just complete any ol' Public Event anywhere in the system" bounties, they knew what they were doing.  &gt;.&gt;
---
I prefer revoker.  The sight,  flinch and ability to miss a shot is great imo. I only have about 2k kills with it,  but tried swapping out with beloved and keep going back to revoker.
---
No, Destiny 1 is staying console exclusive. 
---
If you meant, "can I use my D2 characters from xbox on PC," that is what cross save refers to, which this entire FAQ post is about.
---
I've got like ~200 of each rune now and it's only ever going to go up. 
---
Pretty much got all the godrolls I care about so...
---
True, lol but you know the ones I'm talking about
---
Hero's Burden is the poor man's Recluse
---
The game is not free on battle net. If you got it for free during a giveaway in the past, you have the vanilla game and first 2 expansions, Curse of Osiris and Warmind.
---
You also only need the complete armor set for one character.
---
Call it "da king of da Norf" and it could be paired with the "She's muh queen" SMG.
---
*Laughs in pc cross save*

*Cries in never forgetting where I came from*
---
Sturm quest unlocks after a certain point in the post-story questline "Oh Captain" on nessus. You'll get the Drang sidearm and youll need to use it a bunch for the next quest steps and at the end of those steps youll get sturm.
---
Rat king quest is similar. The quest begins when you finish the post-story quest on Titan. 
---
Post story quests are marked by the blue crown icon on the map. And dont require any dlc since they were both part of the vanilla game.
---
I... spent so long grinding Gambit.
---
I'll turn it on this weekend and try it out.
---
This doesn’t happen too often for me but it used to in D1 for sure.
---
Hahahaha
---
I have no idea what killed me in that one
---
Oh man that really blows.
---
Seriously. Ive been short handed almost every single fucking match today. And the rare occasion we ha e 4, they start fucking around and being useless ass soon as you get to the bridge and need to take zones. As if they dont even realise there is no point in fighting endless ads when you have a crucial amount of time to capture zones
---
That’s breakneck with calus’s selected shader

sorry i just suck sometimes (a lot)

LOL
---
Its probably not a 100% drop. I dont know if itnrequires you to do heroic strikes in the playlist or if you can do it from the director version. But it sounds like it's not 100% few things have 100% drop rates in Destiny 2, but most quest related/exotic catalyst items have bad luck protection so that every time you DON'T get a drop, it increases the chance of it dropping the next time. Sorry if this isn't so helpful.  Best of luck. At least Inverted Spire is one of the best strikes in the game.
---
Yeah i finally broke down and got my recluse off a glory farm
---
I genuinely would enjoy crucible more if we had Forth Horseman back in Destiny as a great super shutdown!
---
i like using frumious blue on recluse
---
Thats awesome but next Tuesday the wendigo and mountaintop quests are changing to make them a little easier.
---
The chalice is account wide. Only needs unlocking once.
---
Should show up in your second character's Pursuits tab.

Yep that’s my game plan.  And next week for bonus infamy I need to reset my infamy one more time for the dredgen title.  Still a lot to do the next couple weeks.

Who knows! Maybe they'll give us an emblem for going through this absolute slog of a quest 💩
---
Got my grav cata from a strike. Just fyi
---
Shhhh inside thoughts
---
S I V A, Aww maaaaaaan.
---
I think it is! That’s how I always read it. It’s so amusing!
---
 It would have been better if it was Ten Paces.
---
Stack them up and then use those stacks to then make a blanket fort for you character. Then wait there until shadow keep...
---
STOP CRYING OVER HIM ALREADY

COWARD!!!!!-Kylo ren

Howa Bout instead of Lord of Wolves you call Wolf Pack, it can have a similar perk to Rat King, in that with more people in a fireteam with this weapon it becomes better: damage, reload, recoil, handling etc. The perks can be Wolf Hunt (what I was talking about earlier in the paragraph) Outlaw, light mag, and Pack Tactics (Whenever you get a kill while under the effects of Wolf Hunt you gain additional handling and reload speed)
---
Never!
---
Just work from home :D

That would actually be hilarious.
---
I thought you got 1 a week? I've only done the wish 1 time for the triumph, so I guess I just assumed is was a weekly thing.
---
I have the same setup and its life changing...then i watch my brother load into destiny on his pc...haha.
---
Just finished it with a second! What a rush! So difficult..
---
Tbf if you’re running bottom tree striker and someone outplays when you’re in your super you deserve to get bagged. You had the world at your finger tips and it still wasn’t enough.
---
Now that is a rare moment
---
Congrats
---
*team rocket is fading away in the background*
---
I will be coming back for shadowkeep! Giving another shot for this game
---
Seems to coincide with 6 PM CST ( influx of US players)
---
I would be more surprised if they didn't spam joutunn. That what is hard to react to like blade barrage
---
I’m pretty sure this is your net man. Had this happen to me before and it’s usually just before my net drops.
---
Hey, I need the super meter full, so I can knee shit in the face and maintain that goddamn melting point up.
---
My net was fine, played for another couple of hours after this.
---
You cant fight when you're that tense guardian, what wrong with you? Relax.
---
Relax more!
---
**I SAID RELAX!**
---
\-shaxx
---
I now have fully committed to the reasoning that OEM is OP and deserves a nerf.
---
You could be into something, other than they would surely be playing on America servers and not EU?
---
So we back on the grind,
---
Cool
---
No, what you buy on steam is pre order only. You can only play through battle net if you already own D2 on battle net, or if you buy DLC on battle net.
---
Hand cannon exotic****
---
Good on ya! I genuinely despise when people do stuff like that.
---
yeah but it's good if used to shut down juggernaut titans
---
Not always, I have read some post about people going into EU servers to play. And your observation could be why they think they play better. They are just laggy.
