If it helps - your built in class ability (on every tree) is the same as one of the 5 usable Warlock exotics, and they buffed the middle tree hammers for DPS purposes. Also... hammer strike.

Fix the damn invitation of the 9 I wouldn’t have a problem with it.
---
I mean...they’re the people who listened to the crying babies about how they couldn’t play crucible without their special weapons
---

---
It’s not all bungie’s fault but Bungie made the final decision
---
CEASAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I have over 100 what use do they even serve

Thank you!

Master working items, infusing, etc

I want Bad Juju plz
---
What if instead I said that I was asking what people thought about the idea of a clan made of only titans?
---
The one shot is only if you have some rivens curse/ blessings.  It does just under the amount for a one shot otherwise.
---
I’m fine with them for now, basically allowing them to have fun until they’re nerfed
---
Intriguing, can you elaborate on the method?
---
Yup....that sums up D2 lore.
---
If a jade rabbit dropped for me is be rather pleased tbh
---
200%
---
Am I able to continue writing comments on this post?
---
Unless the prime is standing in the well you would only have enough time to pull off maybe one full combo before you have to run back for more buff.  Celestial is probably better for more reliable damage.
---
Just seems delayed, I guess.
---
Just go back in time and get it in season 2, problem solved.
---
So I’m the complete opposite. I was purely PVP when I played destiny. They had great PVP but got bored with the meta switches and grind for weapons. Now love BRs and know Bungie could do it great!
---

awwww thank youu jajajaj \^\_\_\_\^

The leader of the team can launch any activity they have access to. They cannot launch activities if they or someone in the team doesn't have access to it. 
---
So say for example one person has done story mission 6, one has done story mission 4, and one has done story mission 3. If 4 was the leader, and tried to launch story mission 5, they wouldn't be able to bring the person who'd only done 3 with them, because that person hasn't reached that part of the story yet. They would  be able to bring the person who had done story mission 6, even though that person had already done it.
---
The blackout modifier is active today giving enemies significantly stronger melee attacks. If it changes tomorrow it should be easier again.
---
Forsaken made Destiny better than it has ever been before and it is still maintaining itself very well. There is MORE than enough content for you to play, along with *plenty* of types of things to do, so if you're asking if its worth your money, it is and then some.
---
What safe spots??? I couldn't find a single spot in that room thats not getting shot by either the ogre, the vandals, or the wizards

&gt; Vorgeth was far harder than Dul Incaru, for me.
---
Vorgeth is far harder than Dul Incaru, for everyone :P
---
Last time I mentioned that to a destiny console player I got like 40 down voted and a bunch of messages sent to me.
---
It would probably be the most unbalanced BR ever, seeing as how they have a hard time balancing their regular PVP
---
not saying this is how it is, but it almost seems like all these "grenade launcher dudes" posts seem like they are actively trying to get a suicide.
---
They had us in the first half, not gonna lie.
---
Yes it is exactly like that for new players. Get a good shotgun and destroy everything
---
People criticize the game because they love it and want it to succeed and prosper.
---
Okay thank you! I figured if I could buy the game and 3 DLC for $60 I could at least keep myself entertained for quite a while.
---
#magnificent bark
---
Geez they really did buff those drop rates!
---
I got it the day it came out so I know you can do it in a couple days easy if you stay dedicated
---
I would have like 500 ish cores but I just master work the dumbest stuff all the time like a year one time lines vertex and a duke. I have like 4 weapons that I shouldn’t have masterworked and two full master worked armor sets on my hunter and I’m sitting on about a stack of 300 cores atm. (Didn’t use the infinite core exploit). *if you want a fun gun to derp around with try the proelium fr3 with rampage a charge time master work and with some range perks, obviously use a rampage spec. This gun absolutely shreds adds. Note the reason that I have this italics part is because this is one of the weapons I’ve masterworked and it’s really fun highly recommend it for pve.*
---
Why collect vanguard and crucible
---
Awesome thanks for the quick and simple answer. Do you know if it will be added to the pool right after the event ends or will there be a time period between the event ending and the exotic being added?
---
Nah, warlock
---
Wow, that is some dedication. Did you do it with the Brother Vance method? If so, how does your clicking finger feel?
---
That is a really deep fried Drifter.
---
Here’s a little heads up for what elemental shield enemies commonly use.
---
Fallen Captains: Arc (blue shields)
---
Hive Wizards: Solar (orange shields)
---
Vex Minotaurs: Void (purple shields)
---
Cabal Centurions: Solar
---
There’s also the Taken version of enemies.
---
Taken Captain: Solar
---
Taken Wizard: Void
---
Taken Centurion: Arc
---
Some other enemies from each faction will also have shields if you’re playing certain activities, but you won’t run into that for a while. This list is just the enemies that you’ll be encountering more often, so it’s useful to know what works well on them.
---
Yeah I saw the triumphs weren't very difficult so I'm not too worried. Good to know it doesn't take long, thank you.
---
Id say just make it exotic with a bit of a buff where idk but it will at least keep people from having wardcliff also.
---
I got all the steps for Luna done before I got to 700. It's much much easier than trying to do it when you're up against higher-tier players.
---
Lately I haven't been having great matches. Luna's and Recluses at 1k Glory gets pretty frustrating. It's hard to counter the two when all the maps are mostly close quarters. Ace has been an absolute hero for me when in larger maps.
---
Thanks I’ve already encountered fallen captains and the hive wizard. It’s a bit annoying to have to manually go into your inventory and switch to a different energy weapon in the middle of a fight when you notice the shield color…
---
I honestly think the drop rates are fair, been getting exotics every two or three days. Playing Anthem really makes me appreciate Destiny 2 more. The content is great as well
---
It should be added immediately after the event ends.
---

Is it that hard to type a normal sentence?

I think I'm more impressed by the Calus Tokens.

That's a lot of Tokens...

Complaining about legitimate issues with a game post launch is not a bad thing. Im starting to think consumers like getting the short stick every time. 
---
At least Anthem subreddit is a nuclear holocaust, they deserve that at least.
---
The fact that this guardian looks incredibly similar to mine is intriguing and upsetting. More face customization options would be kinda nice.
---
&gt;It is possible to highlight problematic issues and still enjoy D2 as a well made and fun game.
---
THAT IS NOT A WEAKNESS, THAT IS LIFE
---
im sorry, i was getting Picard vibes from your comment for some reason
---
I knew it was dying but damn lol
---
It’s hell in a cell!
---
Realising that it could be so much better
---
How often do you text him to ask when your IP is going to be banned?
---
I haven't seen anything on Anthem but I've heard it's pretty bad. Why is it bad?
---
We have to shit on the game, otherwise bungo wouldnt try so hard to make a better game
---
yeah its pretty fun when its free, i spent 120$ in total on this game i think roughly and i dont even have the annual pass... people got the base game for free and the first dlc for free if they bought forsaken for 30$
---
aaaaand we're back to blood cleaver. diversity was nice while it lasted
---
Rose tinted glasses. People used to harass Luke Smith on Twitter about how shitty D1 was. People complained constantly and threatened en mass to move to The Division when it debuted.
---
Haha I did the raid for the first time two weeks ago, got 1k. My clanmates have like upwards of 50-100 clears with none xD feels bad bro.
---
What's hard about spamming rockets/nades in her face?
---
Google the anthem kotaku article. It's fascinating and outlines a complete disaster in the making.
---
It’s not necessary, but it’s where all the new stuff is at. 
---
The first part of the pass; Black Armory, is a PvE centred mini DLC which revolves around the forges. The Forge activity gets boring after a short while, but the DLC has amazing loot and a cool raid.
---
The second part of the pass revolves around the Drifter and his hybrid PvPvE game mode gambit. This mini DLC contains Gambit Prime; a more fast paced, competitive version of gambit. Playing gambit prime gives you items which you then take into the new pinnacle PvE activity called the Reckoning. Completing the reckoning grants you armor with special perks based around certain roles in gambit: The invader, Collector, Sentry and Reaper. These perks are only available when playing Gambit Prime.
---
We also have the allegiance quest. You pick a side between the drifter and the vanguard, and after proving yourself worthy you can claim weekly rewards from the vendor you sided with. This choice will apparently affect future content.
---
Thorn and The Last Word are back.
---
The final DLC of the pass is yet to release, and the only thing we know is that it’s related to Calus somehow. Darkdrinker, Hawkmoon and Rose will appear in that DLC according to leaks. A new raid as well.
---
Thank you so much for the informative post but what gives you that solo raid?
---
Ok, im a solo player and i suck. The best thing to do is find teammates. When you solo que find other solo players. I didnt want to do it, but i found 3 other players and now we're almist there.
---
Some tips i picked up:
---
Abuse everything. Hunter skip grenades, spectral, whatever works. Just remember to bleach your hamds afterwards. I use ace, with a god roll retold tale and a hammerhead with rampage a f quickdraw.
---
This is going to sound clichè-ish, but stick with your team. 4 people running around gunning down 1 person is better than a 1v1. Dont try to flank unless absolutely necessary. Stick with your team
---
Supers. Dont have more than one active at a time. Arrange it so you have both shutdown (blade barrage, nova bomb, thundercrash) and roaming (daybreak, arc staff, spectral, fists of havoc)
---
Weapons. Change them to suit the map. This dosent mean everybody should be running snipers. Maybe 2 people running scouts OR a single playing sniper. Once again, this dosent apply to everything, you need to make a decision what loadout to use and what will be most effective. If you think all snipers is the best go, then do it.
---
Playing off the point above, if you are running a sniper and pulse, stay away from CQ areas. If you go there, chances are you will die. Cater to the areas your guns are built towards. Another example, if youre running DRB and a trust, stay away from long sightlines, and in the close to mid section
---
Lastly, use your sitting emote to peek around corners. Its really tryhardish but its super effective
---
Ask if you have any questions. Good luck
---
 Every one is complaining about them but now that I’m power 700 I have like 500 Sitting in my inventory
---
Literally 2 times from sos,one in comp and the last one from gambit, all within the span of 2.5 hours
---
Definitely too op
---
pc, us
---
Like still having p2p connections on a shooting game in 2019, having a mode named competitive then saying crucible isn't a main priority, random untested sandbox changes plus having to wait whole seasons for something to get fixed
---
~~2k voices~~ 4K voices

Not yet but I’ll make the gif soon. X3 I’m still working on next video about the cursebreaker.
---
Good luck!
---
Made. Although it wouldn't surprise me if someone already made one like it
---
If it hits you spot on. I've whiffed that attack plenty enough times.
---
Wowwwww you’re so lucky. Jajaja.  When I got the sparrow, I got is on my 3  run and had no idea i it was for the title x3 hahaha.
---
Can you help carry me too? :&lt;
---
Congrats dude! I love this gun, it's so versatile. Yesterday I tried the mountain top/Recluse combo (unlocked mountain top on Monday) and on the first match I got 30 kills. They're both really worth the grind.
---
Anteus Ward is a hit and miss for me. The shield you get I'd VERY brief but can give you a small leg up when sliding towards oncoming fire. However, I've yet to backfire and rockets fired at me.
---
I was so happy so I started to make more ships. I would give everyone free ships if Bungie allow me too x3.
---
as an invader, hunter main.
---
i.. gotta agree man, its always the f#cking hunter in gold gear with a golden lunas howl.. f#ckin always.
---
I could smell the sweat through the screen 
---
Gg tho
---
Light Level: 696 
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Agree, i get the nerf but it bothers me seeing people without the gun whine and bitch
---
Hahaha you’ve seen them too. Yes they look cool, but that’s about all they have to show
---
After 70+ clears :( I can absolutely go on sale for my Apex Predatorssss, the new Edge Transit of LW raid... btw Nations would warm my heart.
---
lndeed. It’s like you never tried vanilla before and suddenly u have an opinion on how disgusting it is. Makes no sense
---
but there is no real endgame formula in WF
---
Lol
---
All i want is sun shot ^anditsbuff. Is that really to much to ask.
---
nice
---
Countdown for sure, I've never played breakthrough though.
---
Yes
---
I just want the fuckin scout rifle holy shit is it too much to ask
---
cool my butt, dude
---
your golden LH aint impressive, wanna impress me?
---
dont be a jackass who camps at the portal, with no invader gear, when theres no invader related bounties, when you see me
---
the only invader
---
head to toe in notorious invader gear
---
sniper in hand, locked and loaded
---
kthx &lt;3
---
WHats  gambit prime noob here
---
My friend in a nutshell
---
I grinded most of it in the last iron banner using the tonics from the event. The multikills is definitely the worst part. I used triple GL until I completed the medals, then I switched to colony to get the multis. I still kept militia's in my kinetic slot hoping for a few multikills when I had no power ammo. The whole multikill grind is based on luck, I couldn't find a way to get consistent multis every match. Good luck guardian, just don't give up!
---
Lol he's grinding in comp... What do you expect? Not using everything he can to try to win? 
---
Comp 101- do whatever you can to win.
---
Battlefield V must have the record for that. Another EA game...
---
Thank you. It can get really frustrating especially when there is nothing that can outrun Luna/NF in the current state of crucible.
---
Sorry I can't help you much there.(Titan). Lunafaction boots are always helpful, but probably not the best.
---
I wish it was but you can get the ship from completing from the Shattered Throne.
---
Not a bad plan, but it could always backfire which results in a loss
---
ya ever die in a well though? it not only hurts virtually, but also a little bit physically and mentally
---
How much of this was the abuse of pinnacle weapons glitch?
---
I have played Destiny Vanilla back in 2014 and i liked it a lot so it’s not like i Don’t know how the game works
---
A banner you could put on your armor going off of the mini banner idea
---
finish forsaken, get the ace of spade and finish dreaming city mission to unlock it. then farm your light level and play some gambit or crucible. once you get all the exotic and good roll on weapon and armour and hit max light you may seek to do raid.
---
Weapons in Anthem are almost useless even masterworks aren't that good, I find myself never using them just jumping around and using my abilities
---
I CALL BS THEY DON’T EXIST
---
After you do all of forsaken unlock dreaming city reach 700 light when ur bored but reach 600 light to do Last wish and try and raid. Then do Black Armory and then gambit prime
---
you don't need 1k voices, that unknown slot is for the corrupted nightfall pulse rifle the horrors least.
---
It’s not 1kv you need it’s the DC pulse which you get from the corrupted NF
---
tbh ive been putting this off because i thought i wasn't good enough but eventually i achieved it by determination, staying positive and finding my best time slot for me to perform at my best was worth every second but i think i will take a break before i push for Not Forgotten
---
There have been multiple threads on /r/DestinyTheGame over the past weeks
---
That's a misquote, it's "[Good guess, but actually no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbU-4eAxl6I)"
---
Fuck that guy.
---
Flexin that 1KV
---
The reason why LH and NF were an issue was because there was no need to "get the perk going". You could be walking in la-la land for a minute and cross paths with someone and 3 tap them
---
Bad juju and obsidian mind in their prime please.
---
I used to think it only dropped on curated weapons but I got it on an armor piece
---
GL multikills in IB didn’t count last season. Do they count now?
---
I know the Luna's/NF nerf will be impactful on the guns, but at the same time they'll still be good and useful. Bit faster than the Ace and Thorn, same damage as them though. 3 tap headshot. 2 headshot/1bodyshot. Whoever earned the guns themselves will still play well with them equipped
---
Cheesing? This is an exploit to get a weapon completely undeservedly by manufacturing lobbies.
---
Nah dude you can get it from there too just rare? Did you get it already? If so then it can drop anywhere
---
It's actually not so bad. Only someone looking to have absolutely no fun themselves is chucking suppressors or enhanced skip grenades the whole game. If I get tilted at the pace of the match then I just try some different builds around riskrunner, which I would never normally use in crucible.
---
That's how you get both of them its not a glitch at all lol
---
Post removed on grounds of exploitation. This is a bannable offence within the game.
---
yea I have a clip saved of it, i was pretty mad because I've been farming for the jotūn and was pretty dissapointed because all the videos I've seen say that you can only get from the first forge.
---
Whenever I see how much better the range on other people's shotguns with good rolls, I remember why I don't like playing crucible. This probably isn't even the max, but my shotgun would have missed 80% of those far shots.
---
Nah those are old you def can get it from there as well most people do. But the chances are really in your engram. For your weapon. But it’s possible to farm and eat lucky. I did.
---
I switched between colony, and any other grenade launcher with a high blast radius
---
Fair enough. Just trying to help the community bypass a the quest step that detracts from the objective of crucible.
---
sorry didn't really know because all the information I've got points to the only way getting the bow is from the volunderforge
---
What rule number does this violate in the sub?
---
I play 90%PvP, I take back what I said lol. Of this event was a week long it would have been alright, but three weeks is too much. Just the extra orbs in crucible are insane when you can get a super within a minute
---
Top Tree Gunslinger: Pew Pew Pew Pew Pew Pew Pew Pew Pew Pew Pew Pew Pew Pew Pew Pew Pew Pew

Bottom Tree Gunslinger: Pow **Pow** ***POW***
---
Middle Tree Gunslinger: .........................
---
Middle Tree Gunslinger was too lazy to bring his Golden Gun
---
i found it quiet easy (took 2 days) only cos i was on a 5 win streak for 12 matches, would of gotten it faster if i didn't get bored/verse sweaty 4 mans
---
Follow up question, what is the cheapest a material would get in glimmer cost? Is 2500 the cheapest or does it get lower?
---
Your punches really nasty though, gotta hand it to you Titan bois.
---
But we have a nasty gun.
---
Bite of the fox is the way to go
---
Melting point is all we really bring to engame pve. And even spectral hunters can apply the same debuff (albeit spectral is not very common in raids)
---
I dont have to keep doing it, only changed once
---

Whaaat I didn’t know that. That’s sick! Thanks for the info.
---
idk why, but serious motion blur just makes things 10x funnier, take my upvote
---
also nice meme :)
---
This is how I got to fabled over the weekend. HH supernova, TLW, and a hyper aggressive flanking gameplay strat. While both sides are spamming grenades at the choke point, I go around to hit them from the side. Usually pick off a lone player on the way. TLW makes for stupid quick mop-ups if you only tag them on the outer range of the HHS. Snipes for helping team shoot at range.
---
I feel bad for the cheese.. I killed some dudes over and over again that I’d never be able to without the revelry buff. I’m surprised I didn’t get any mate mail. I’m actually pretty impressed with comp players. Even with the cheese I didn’t see any tbagging either.
---
haha thanks! &lt;3
---
While this hurts to watch as a titan main, and a very funny death, I can't help but think that it is on purpose. You throw the suppressor at the wall then immediately activate your super. I want to believe, but I just can't...
---
You forgot about Code of The Commander shield block. I don't know if it stacks with Well though, i also didn't see anyone really use it for boss kills. Still useful.
---
I wish I could, but I got to work at 0500. I'll try that this weekend.
---
So code of the commander, in most cases, lowers total damage output. It takes someone away from dps and the increase to damahe isnt enough to compensate in most situations.
---
You can run any super you want when you have 3 good masterworked weapons
---
- Breakneck
---
- IKLEOS shotty
---
- Bellowing Giant
---
Love me some Tether + Orpheus, but sometimes you gotta mix it up.
