Ive showed every single person I play Destiny with this... So my girlfriend. Still, this is the epicest of fails!
---

---
My pappy used to say if your gonna fuck it up at least make em wonder how you did it.
---
---
---
Devrim
---
Turns heroic? What do you mean
---
Ok, well if it's any consolation as a titan my grenades feel underpowered now too.
---
everything else is good though
---
\*Accidentally charges into me\*
---
Gotta love the Titans.
---
Stupid question but how would I go about getting exotics in the first place . I haven't managed to find any anywhere . They haven't been dropped , rewarded from looking , nothing.  Any help would be very useful
---
Is that rapid hit or ambitious assassin? Can’t really tell.
---
If it’s rapid hit, bravo. Probably the best gun in the game.
---
Maybe some kind of unholy plague could bring good old days back
---
And people complain about titans. That looks like a lot of fun though.
---
Lol!!  Looks like my MT grind!!
---
Hong Kong?
---
i’ve just re-authenticated it, so i guess just accept it again?
---
Yeah. You never know. The mods might ban me from this channel.
---
Oh shit really?
---
Not there.
---
[deleted]
---
Yeah
---
Playing as a titan means you accept that you need an op class to be good at the game
---
That's what mine did, but mine is habitually more glitchy and nonsensical so take it with a grain of salt
---
Yeah idk what it is about Titans but sometimes the melee me and get an blue shield and to me as a Hunter I can't even do anything about it I just have no choice but to die lmao
---
Thank you
---
I wish I had Jötunn .*sighs angrily*
---
Unstoppable force meets immovable object
---
i’ve kinda got no other option but to accept it, currently waiting for it to load
---
Do you mean cost of armour energy or is someone actually selling the mod?
---
I usually just throw it at solos because I very rarely see any groups when I’m playing and there’s no point holding a super the whole match.
---
That doesn’t explain anything but ok bro 😂
---
*angry hunter main noises intensify*
---
I have a feeling by the time I get it, it’ll be nerfed again...
---
To be honest I can get any exotic beside raid exotics I have watched my friend get 1k 3 times when I’m with him.
---
yeah, the vigilance wing buffs you when your team-mates die, you become a super accurate and fast healing god when the rest of your team has been eliminated.
---
There are certain specific quests that drop some of them, but most of them will come from Xur(weekly vendor that comes on Friday, sells exotics for Legendary Shards), and random drops.
---
That's exactly what I screamed when I saw this 😂
---
Not having my helmet on means my hunter can't have his hood up.
---
Stop asking questions. Sound like a true nosy warlock. that's why i made my warlock a snitch in the drifter season
---
Luna's haunted
---
Noice
---
I AM THE 1% and boy does is SUCK .
---
Detained from who or where?
---
I hate how they have removed levelling. I don’t want to start the game with every ability and subclass unlocked, I don’t want to be high power level. I never completed destiny 2 when I first played it years ago but I had a great time levelling  up and playing through the campaign. Now it just feels boring, what’s the point in doing the original campaign now? Is there anyway I can just start fresh and slowly enjoy the game?
---
What just happened lol !? Jesus !
---
As far as i know the heroic versions only show up when that planet is the flashpoint.
---
But just to be sure chech with brother vance, he may have them on one of his pages.
---
Worse.........
---
That’s true!
---
Haven’t quite decided yet if I like the ship enough to go for it yet. 
---
I got the ship for the whisper catalyst quest so I feel like I’m set, haha.
---
Alright man . Thanks for the help . Very much appreciated for a new player.
---
I’m still stuck on rapid kills
---
The helmet stayed on
---
This is why i just bank all of my exotics.
---
How did you get the enemy POV?!
---
I could be wrong but i think it depends on how well you did in the match
---
I’m in the same boat. Got 4 armor mods from Saladin and can’t find them anywhere
---
returning mail to the sender, Titan style.
---
I think the main difference is that this requires you to get two melee kills before it one hits.
---
I had sooo much trouble with that one. If you play comp you get like 10% (cuz its Survival) if you get double kills. I used colony and tried getting heavy as much as possible. I was stuck at 95% for like 2 days, finally got it now.
---
Idk what else there is to explain dude, i've put in 125 hours into D2 in 12 days, mostly Vex Offensive and bounties, i did a shit ton of Vex bounties and i also did the raid a few times
---
Bottom tree fists of havoc was overpowered since January, so it was long overdue for a nerf. Still, the neutral game is still the same, which is one of the best for PvP, so you still have that.
---
He should have received the weapon on the previous step. The weapon is Polaris Lance. An exotic scout rifl
---
There are one hit supers to combat roaming supers except Dawnblade , but it is preety short so not really an issue IMHO.
---
Here's the full res version that isn't fuked up:
---

---
Ive been playing this game for months and had no idea how to do this heroic event stuff. This games wiki documentation sucks ass compared to most others.
---
Can't wait for their album to drop
---
K. Your who I was talking about buddy. Titan mains are the only ones who dont see it.
---
Is there a difference in which medals give different amounts? And if so, is there any source to use to see this? Because 46 is a heck of a lot less than the 14000 total
---
Yeah but feel is literally it, I have drop mag/feeding frenzy (with better stats in literally every category) so... I'm almost always at reload cap anyway.
---
So I guess yeah, if for some reason you dislike blast furnace but like sacred then god speed, but this still makes me question why Bungie made a ***raid weapon objectively worse than something you can farm directly***.
---
 Hi almost, I'm Dad!
---
Solar Warlocks have always had some sort of Angel-esque design. Back in Destiny 1, Solar Warlocks we’re actually called Sunsingers and would have a very faint pair of bright wings when using Super. Now in Destiny 2, Bungie doubled down on the angelic asthetic to Solar Warlocks, with Dawnblade basically making you a flaming angel with much more noticeable wings and giving you the ability to fly around a lot more and throwing down waves of fire with your sword.
---
1) When does she give you that voice line?
---
2) How many specters have you cleansed from Eris?
---
If you play at least 3 comp games in a week you get a free 120 Glory points at reset on Tuesday.
---
I was at 2094/2100 glory after winning my 19th game, so I could've just waited at that point and gotten Fabled when I logged in the following week. Since the loss penalty is so much smaller now (and since it was Wednesday night and I didn't want to wait for the following Tuesday) I decided to just keep playing for one more win instead - I could've taken several losses in a row before dropping out of the range where either the weekly bonus or one more win would put me over the threshold.
---
Pve is better change my mind
---
What?
---
YASSSSSSS
---
Yeah cause u get killed a lot running around shouldercharging my dude. Yr KD is Trash and u hand out free kills to the other team. Put on your Titan Pants and try ending at the top of the leader board with shouldercharges. It is a low skill floor and low skill ceiling perk.
---
I was a hunter main. Can’t play him anymore, reminds me too much of Cayde. So now I bottom tree striker punch things with OEM..
---
ARE YOU HAPPY BUNGIE? YOU MADE ME THIS WAY. YOU DID THIS TO ME.
---
&gt;game time.
---
No shit. I'm trying to finish scour the rust and good gravy I feel like I'm starting to drown in loot.
---
Dude, I have a lot of complaints about stuff that I want different but I am accepting most of it BECAUSE I understand that other people enjoy it that way. You are just being spiteful here with no good argument.
---
Np my guy!
---
I've seen a lot of people say this, but in every test race I've done with friends mobility does affect sprint speed. Unless hunter's sprint is naturally faster than a Titan's, anyways
---
The last 5-10 minutes of any crucible match is just a bunch of supers, its lame. There are so many roaming supers that you cant escape it. Power ammo and super ruin PvP.
---
No you want to apply a double standard to this situation and I'm not having it.
---
Now you will have to do it on the other two characters..
---
Don't forget to grind for God roll weapons and perfect stats on the armor!
---
I had heard something about 14000 points total too, and how cold fusions are 200 points apiece. I only had 46 of the cold fusion medals,  but that’s not counting the other medals I got along the way. Add a couple gold tier team play medals and some more of the other middle tier ones and it took me a weekend of grinding and I had it done.
---
whenever I see that durp bubble I wish I had spike grenades like in halo 3.
---
Yr playing the wrong game my friend. Space Chaos IS the selling point of Destiny. This is not Arma or CS . 
---
They tried giving us less chaos in Destiny 2 Year 1 , it nearly killed the game. This game thrives on broken builds.
---
Trials of the nine is what it’s called. It was taken out because crucible and the gamemode was very unbalanced and had the same 4 guns being used
---
-_- ok buddy. You are just proving my point. Everyone knows titans are OP in general but titans.
---
You sir are cringe
---
Same
---
Yep nobody seems spacialy aware or they turn off the radar don't use idk
---
1 for PVP.  3 for pve
---
Couldn’t agree more
---
THATS WHAT IT WAS! Thank you! and yeah tbh i remember uriel’s gift and mida were like the only things used in that mode lmao.
---
Do they have anything similar to that now? Or just normal crucible and iron banner
---
Didn’t say we arent OP at the moment there bud, yr singling out a single perk. I am telling u shouldercharges don’t make the Titan OP. There other broken bits that do.
---
They have survival which is comp and is 3v3
---
Ohhhh dear dear
---
Such a shame it has such a badass name and I like the perk but it’s just terrible
---
1. General rule of thumb is to check if the legendaries have the god roll of your choice (aka the best mods for either PvP or pve depending on what u are look for)
---
2. Yep u are correct, just legendary weapons/armour from specific unique sets to the vendor
---
Holy shit where is it
---
And I’m on the part to get to fabled and I hit fabled 1 but pursuit isn’t finished
---
You have to have the pursuit from shaxx at the tower then win games until the triump reaches 100% then you complete the triumph in the triumph menu then you go back to shaxx to receive the weapon
---
A lot of people stopped playing for a year. Lots got back into destiny for new expansion. Now it’s free to play and people are complaining. Do you have OEM? What’s your GT for stat lookup
---
To see if you’ve been using these “broken” things.
---
Did you hit fabled glory or valor? Also you might need to hop into tower and then back into orbit, had to do that with recluse
---
Sure is, it is in the noodle shop opposite of Ikora
---
I'd also suggest looking for a clan as well, good rewards and depending on the one you join could have a lot of active players that may be willing to help. Can also be found in the r/fireteams sub as well.
---
Shadowkeep 100%
---
it's never to late to get back in. i recommend for u too hop back in. embrace the grind!
---
Reread. I said "but he's dead".
---
Ya glory
---
Yo, bro, I hate Iron banner, my arc staff doesn't one hit anybody because I'm not 960, and then, i go goldy, so, yeah, but then I csnt even get my super before cuck ass saladman calls a mercy rule. This game is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack
---
He literally just did it Again because I was doing too well, b ckowiqvskspqlbs x wkwnx nw
---
Oh, it happened again: a third time in a row
---
Then try the second half of my comment
---
My Exo Yondu lookin ass Hunter just doesn’t feel like takin off his Shadows Mask
---
Doing that rn
---
I think it was meant as a way to put everything in one spot for new people and not make the maps too overwhelming
---
I break OEM titans with melee build. It’s an exotic it should be powerful.
---
I main top tree goldie and bottom tree arcstrider for a while. 
---
Golden gun is great but it makes you think when and how to pop it since everyone will run till the short timer runs out. It’s animation can be to long but it’s great to shutdown multiple supers, auto firing is nice. It’s a satisfying super doesn’t really feel cheesy.
---
I hated using it at first because you gotta be patient when to pop it then be ready to spam it and be aggressive. 
---
It’s neutral game is pretty weak but the throwing nice is niche and comes in handy when a shotgun doesn’t get the kill so you need a quick clean up, also great for when you got to reload or check if someone is camping behind a corner.
---
It’s got a perk that lets you and allies reload faster, I love that perk since I use thorn and it only have 9 shots. 
---
Golden gun tree does not offer a sprint boost which is a huge downside it’s best to pair it with stompees.
---
But for a competitive setting I’d go with arc strider for ease of use, I’ll still use Goldie in comp or iron banner depending on the map.
---
No no no. Bungie needs to do their job and fix that.
---
And how come spike grenades I’ve seen so many people say sticky grenades are very good
---
Kinda dumb move if you ask me
---
Ahhhh!!!! Thank you!
---
Ace of spades
---
It looks like a poop that went through the m.. mask. Yeah. That's totally a sentence I expected to type in this lifetime. It's a nice mask though, but where's the one eye?
---
OEM isn’t even a crutch at this point 
---
The entire hospital is keeping you from drowning in your own sweat.
---
Yeah but using fusion rifles is terrible, versing them is like the other team throwing (I dont think I've ever seen someone do actually good using a fusion). They're rarely used in pve. They're kinda just unneeded in the game. Destiny would barely change without them.
---
Shadowkeep
---
Same, why isn't it?
---
Honestly, power level doesn’t matter if the other team doesn’t get on the objectives
---
Reddit cried about this during previous years, now that it's here, Reddit is crying again. I'm against light level differences mattering, but to be honest, Reddit deserves it.
---
HB with catalyst/LQ/Wendigo.
---
I'm hiding my shame of my Lord Farquad face
---
This reason alone is why I always used an MG, and the fact that I didn’t get one til Xur sold one a year after the game came out. Still pissed about that and that was nearly 5 years ago.
---
Bröthër
---
You sound really pissed off about something with a simple fix?
---
So I bought the digital deluxe accidentally. I didn't realize there was a regular and a deluxe. I just clicked the button to buy shadowkeep in the store and it put digital deluxe in my cart. I naively assumed "damn I guess this dlc is $60 but the game is fun and reminds me of good times in d1" so I bought it lol. 
---
I have a bunch of new player questions. Do you know if there's a specific subreddit or post I should direct those to?
---
D1 blue Engram rewarding legendary loot. Skitz
---
Well fair enough. So I can do all the "old school" intro missions and getting the tower "back" right?
---
I haven't really been struggling all three of my characters are at 935  after finishing Iron banner for each one. Started iron banner at 915 or less for each one.  Still averaged 2.0 kda
---
everytime this is reposted a baby dies
---
It's probably a trend b/c anyone who feels "skilled" using that combo doesn't really want to try
---
Even after I say “ don’t kill him please”. It’s as funny as it is frustrating.
---
Aim way higher, they will hit harder.
---
To put it in perspective, I've gotten 50% towards mountaintop, I got the recluse, and almost have the revoker, all while farming for this gun. I played 2 hours of Gambit and have almost finished the exit strategy farm.
---
Google, Of course. You could probably post them here and get a mix of good answers and vitriol, as is Reddit.  
---
You could message me, if you'd like. I'd be glad to answer what I know.
---
Nice, just need a Dragon Zord.
---
Well aren't you special
---
Spike grenades increase direct hit damage, mountaintop is basically made for direct hit
---
Forsaken tbh it fixed a lot of stuff that was wrong with d2.
---
Jesus Christ cease fire, cease fire!
---
Bottom tree Striker Titan for everything.
---
My K/D has never been higher.
---
I believe it’s bugged from other post I’ve seen
---
Ya and I’m guessing I should get scavenger for it I’m having trouble getting that
---
Drifter all the way. Shit Zavala and Akora let him stay, so it’s really just the council of snobs that don’t like him. Plus sweet cutscene with drifter.
---
must not know about champions then
---
its all based on personal performance , i had a match where a buddy lost points on a game we lost but i earned 100 points .
---
Dude clearly got on here feeling a bit heated after getting fucked in the crucible. Y'all are clearly antagonizing the guy and then giggling like children when you made him more mad. Victim Complex gets awarded to you, for antagonizing people and then pretending you didn't do anything. Take this L.
---
*Darkness winks* “I got you bro”
---
Mines much worse
---
Or you are just a scrub that will only use FOTM weapons.
---
Guess they're still working on it. In any event, the solo queue is much better than before, no? At least, lots of people say so.
---
Always? I will have to confirm this when I get home from work.
---
i kill public event bosses before they go heroic just for the fun of it, stay away from the tangled shore
---
I'm hiding my shitty painted exo, leave me alone
---
Fusion rifles, machine guns, rockets, shotguns.
---
Eassssy now.....you guys are about to cross a line.
---
I’m gonna say even just on premise I was more invested in Forsaken’s story. But that’s just my two cents on two really great expansions
---
I miss the gun variety of d1 (I personally remember seeing almost every gun used) i wasnt killed by the same damn guns match after match
---
Git gud
---
Seems like he does, in fact, rotate locations. I’ve been grinding +0 gear and I’ve only ever found him in 1 place on the map each week. Last week was Hellmouth and the week before that was Anchor of Light.
---
Chalice....Beast.......swords.....I mean Solar......Fuck! lol
---
Am I the only one who see's the Tanith First And Only Emblem on that?
---
Is there a way to enable friendly fire?
---
You you can't plug and play a ps3 controller to pc
---
Kinda dumb to think it's a hassle to have all quest locations in spot to start them.
---
I mean jade rabbit 3 taps too
---
I could say the same for hunters and warlocks lol
---
Oh, I know about the warmind music, but this is more recent so I thought more people would understand. Feel free to make this but with Warmind if you want.
---
Get a load of this hunter
---
Titan's are being nerfed, patch coming soon
---
Ok cool thanks
---
No u
---
what's interesting is that I totally can do that with dark souls 3. I've never had a problem with that game. I can even play with my knock off nintendo switch controller. It's just Destiny 2 that's giving me a hard time.
---
Yep most modern military type games have more game chat. Hell modern warfare seems to be bringing back the good old days of game chat trash talk. Siege, cod, hell even battlefield have more game chat communication that destiny.
---
And really just about any state if ya google hard enough
---
Well yes, but actually no. Ranks are account wide but the LH/NF quest is not. So yes, getting to legend rank will allow you to auto complete once you get to that specific step on another character but you will still need the 300 Luna kills.
---
A purple exo face
---
Okay. They are there to help us fight the darkness. Yeah its not the most skilled way to get kills in an fps game, but if you dont find it fun I can only say never play mayhem.
---
I'm using an XBOX controller, so I haven't had any issues. However, I did have to turn off the XBOX controller configuration support in Steam settings. When I had it on the game kept switching between thinking I had a controller or a m+kb.
---
...and than you get sniped...
---
That how I feel as far as pvp is concerned, especially roaming supers where you can die twice to the same one if unlucky enough. I would enjoy a mode with supers turned off
---
Can confirm, sometimes it just doesn't work. No progress and no notification that i got the medal. Luckily i'm done with it, this shit was awful.
---
Cup... 
---
sun.... 
---
....
---
What the hell is it Josh ?! 
---
Oh uhhh... looks like a dog
---
"Wipe"
---
Well see now that’s just rude. I may main a titan but I’m a shy titan who prefers my helmet on. Mainly because I can’t use any weapons in the tower so I use my head
---
Dang I didn't even look at the comments and you already did this. My bad lol
---
Happened to me wormhaven and the retribution. Lagged out of cane and spawned back in. All I could do was kill people with grenades.
---
It's super fair, deffinitly not super fucking frustrating for people trying to have fun playing a video game, titans are great!
---
My last match yesterday was a 2.88 and I'm 914 rn
---
LMAO The entitlement on this one
---
Why would you be?
---
Which helmet is that!?!
---
I have an erentil with firmly planted and range finder that can kill 40 meters plus, is that still okay?
---
You douchebag, lol
---
If you’re being serious, there’s an option in your settings menu where you can choose to always have your helmet off in non combat zones
---
You are incorrect.
---
Sounds like you suck
---
I dunno, maybe at *lower levels*(no offense), I could see how supers feel this way, but in comp higher levels, supers aren't really that hard to avoid, and it's obvious to some extent when someone's about to use them. There is also a pretty good level of skill when it comes to when you pop your super, both for roaming and stationary. It is also alot easier to kill people during their super, then it was, so we got that going for us. 
---
If you got the patience, keep grinding it out and you'll see what I mean.
---
How are you 656 for starters
---
In PVE it's like any other hand canon  without a kill perk soo
---
Jesus, that’s Hugh from like 40 years ago
---
Yeah it really sucks they don't just give you handouts. They should really give you everything for free so that you never have to play this game ever.
---
"I like to beat the brush." - Bob Ross

---
I think I was like power level 260 during the first year or so before they revamped everything, I guess this scaled into my current level
---
I mean that's the purpose of the Sweet Business, suppression and a never ending stream of bullets.
---
every guy that has tokens? 
---
what about the gunsmith ? i have a lot of materials from weapons or wtv it is called
---
Funny I was talking about this earlier. Found out about Destiny 1 about 6 hours prior to release from my best friend. Had no clue it was a thing. Got the midnight release, and have preordered every single dlc and addition to the games since. Haven’t gotten so much as an emblem stating as such. Would love to be able to show that I’m a day 1 guardian. Now a discount would be nice, but that is just hilarious even thinking about the possibility. They don’t even do PlayStation exclusivity anymore. Was supposed to be a PlayStation only game in the beginning.
---
Praise the cameraman
---
[removed]
---
Everyone in the game, even players who buy it today for the first time, will start at power level 750.
---
And a custodes strike force
---
You are compensated for buying the game when it first came out by being able to play the game since it first came out...
---
for real. thanks for the refresher and stolen karma, “op.”
---
No. That would be incredibly stupid for a company to give back the revenue they earn off a current F2P title that was formerly P2P.
---
Phoenix plate with the fur. You’re a man of culture
---
Yes. You get to have played the game for two years. Hope you had fun.
---
I’d say Riskrunner is god tier against most races, since they’ve all got at least one source of arc damage, it’s just more effective against some than others. It’s highly underrated at the very least, and easily my favourite exotic.
---
Could be this is my 3rd character
---
Yeah the recluse is the best weapon in the entire game right now
---
I dont think anything would really be impacted besides back up plan being a more wide spread perk and fusion rifle range getting a slight proxy nerf.
---
energy points, like Arc, solar, or void energy.  the more of these points you have the more mod capacity that piece of armor can equip.  speaking of mods there are different types of mods including resilience, mobility, recovery, discipline, intellect, and strength mods. adding one of these can add 10 points of the desired stat to your total for that stat.
---
Preference, One controllers are a little smaller and 360 are a little bigger. I prefer 360 and think people that prefer One controllers are weird or have small hands.
---
i totally agree with this. The Reduction of Damagemigration while in Super was already a good step they took. Now the Tuning in Bottom tree could make Play against Titan more enjoyable. The last thing they need to tweak is OEM. But they already have a "eye" on this.
---
Pretty sure that’s a rune. There should be a chest nearby with three symbols on it, and there’ll be three of those runes in the surrounding area. If you shoot them in the right order, the chest opens and you get some loot.
---
noice
---
I'm more curious on what armor that guy is using.
---
The darkness isn’t evil. Excess in Light or Dark are evil.
---
Consider this, both the light and darkness are cancerous to the universe, The Light will make life expand until it is no longer sustainable and the Darkness will kill until there is only one last being in the universe.
---
I think there is a pvp mode that was created for that but I can’t remember what it was
---
The next sandbox update is to include one eyed mask nerf which means Bungie will butcher it and healing is removed from Bottom tree striker and super energy with kills while in super is being reduced so my prediction is everyone will move over to top tree striker. Expect a major increase in shoulder charging insurmountable skull fort titans. Heed my warning
---
yes.
---
Ahhhh okay like the chest in the dreaming city with the three energy orbs
---
nice one
---
I dont think we will if I'm honest. Bungie is an independent entity without the financial backing of a large publisher. We may see a return to more ingame storytelling but I dont think now would be a good time for bungie to shell out money for more voice acting talent.
---
Thanks man 👍
---
i run that and a kinetic shotgun so id say yeah.
---
I hadn't touched my Titan until IB on Tuesday, went from 750 to 930 by the end of Scour the Rust.
---
How do I get it
---
Ohhhh. Then I guess you’re right, it’s a bit on the high side, but we’ve got all season to do it.
---
They made comp pretty easy now. Try grinding mountaintop...
---
id say yes. throw a kinetic shotgun on and roll
---
I solo queued for my Luna and my Revoker. After that I didnt touch comp for half the season.
---
If you get it wrong. A knight appears to beat you round the head.
---
There should be a quest you can pick up from Lord Shaxx. It'll have you complete the triumph "The Stuff of Myth" where you need to win 100 PvP games and reach 2,100 points in the fabled playlist.
---
Titans are op, but scrubby exotics need a nerf NOT the class. The one eye mask scrubs and skull fort scum are the issue not all titans. Most titans are actually pretty cool and a lot of fun to play against. 
---
If you're dying then you should try to figure out what mistakes you are making and figure out to correct them. There is a counter for everything in the game even OEM and skullfort. 
---
Sometimes people are better than you or they just got lucky. Everybody has somebody who is better and worse than them which is totally fine beacause It means you can always be improving and learning new tips/skills. 
---
One eye mask is getting a nerf, but it's not getting removed from the game nor are titans. You should work on learning to counter them along with anything else you are dying to. 
---
Take a deep breathe when you die and level your head. You'll do better if you focus and play with a clear head instead of anger. 
---
Don't hate all titans. They are your friends and a really great class. Respect your fellow guardians and don't post class hate on reddit. 
---
-A fellow hunter.
---
I'm more bothered that you were using risk runner and avoiding that arc damage buff right below you....  Whhhyyyyy
---
I have no clue why you are getting down voted for having an opinion. I gave you some upvotes to help out with your karma, but to my point. 
---
everybody has their own play style and what works for one person may not work for another. If you don't like recluse then I would suggest suros regime which is an exotic auto rifle. It's definitely the best in the game in my opinion. 
---
Recluse has potential to be a great gun for the correct player. Not liking it has nothing to do with skill instead Its personal opinion and play style. I'm sorry you didn't like the gun, but on the bright side you have the skill to get to fabled which is something to be proud of! 
---
 I hope you have a great night and hope people chill out soon.
---
I tested kt out yesterday and it does work woth hunters but it isnt a one shot. It  leaves them with a quarter of their health left so it pairs wel with a sub machine gun or autorifle right after you use tempest strike. I use monte carlo right after so i have a chanve to get it back instantly and it works really well
---
Warlock bc that's the only class I played so far. Mostly played as Dawnblade and tried the other two trees just a little bit.
---
at this point my friend its actually comical how angry this kid is getting lol I seriously dont get his issue.
---
Lmao being bored in a loading screen totally means upset. It took like 10 seconds to do. You filed bankruptcy, so not surprised you have to sell stuff. It's hilarious how much of a neckbeard you are. Cry me a river boyyo, I've likely had way more sex than you'll ever have in your life. Get a life dude, you got flamed online, no need to tell people to kill themselves is there?
---
Well I meant as part of the map fragments. There is one that is to finish nightfall with a power handicap of 100.
---
Not a score requirement any more? That’s very easy then
---
That is a fair point. I downvoted him to hell for being toxic. It's probably past his bedtime and just cranky. Anyways, good luck!
---
You have to slog through the first quest step. When you complete it you automatically get a weapon needed for the next step. The Pulse Rifle is incredibly good and if you get the god roll it's out of this world. I was a hand cannon type of player but after finishing all the quests I went back to it. The SMG is very good too, btw.
---
It's okay in PvE, but in PvP oh gosh it's so bad, would never use it again
---
?
---
So try rocking a cheesy build. Middle tree voidwalker. You will have handheld supernova, monitor your radar charge this bad boy around corners and 1HK them. Get yourself a dustrock blues from menagerie if you have the chalice going. If not get a nice shotty. Pretty braindead way of playing but it'll get the job done as long as you can read the radar decently 😎 also a 150handcannon for good measure.
---
Seems about right.
---
I heard that 60+ items were keepers.
---
Still waiting for this cancer launcher to be removed from gambit
---
Damn, u lookin fine
---
first off when you get older and actually have things and shit happens you have to take the appropriate steps...im sorry that mommy and daddy has always bailed you out apparently. First off bankruptcy is public record so anyone with enough interest could find that out lol which brings me to my next point...how fucking pathetic must you be to look me up and my posts just to have "ammo" thinking it would upset or get at me? Dude this is a destiny thread and you in your infinite pathetic wisdom decided to attempt to "flame me" first off i think the only thing flaming here is your apparent interest in my personal life which is flattering but creepy at the same time. I truthfully hope you get some help...you obviously need it cause you are a pathetic pathetic individual
---
That's how I got a lot of progress for my brother.. after I did it for myself the normal "try not to go insane"-way
---
Yes, before the launch of shadowkeep you would loose the mod. 
---
You are now free to try every mod for some glimmer as long as it can go on you armor piece, you have it unlocked and have enough glimmer.
---
i bought destiny 2 around launch before the first dlc and lost interest. it seems to be way better now. do i have to pay for all of the separate DLCs or am i compensated also since free to play players have access to the DLCs for free?
---
you should see  his newest lol trying to get at me. this dude actually looked me up and my posts so he could have "ammo" to get at me lol this kid is pathetic lol
---
I play with an Xbox One Controller and sometimes a 8bitdo SN30 Pro. I tried yesterday with my girlfriend's PS4 Dualshock controller connected via Bluetooth. The Steam big picture interface works alright. But Destiny2 doesn't respond, I can open the menus and even tested the DualShock on other games in steam (Shadow of War worked fine) but Destiny2 is a no go with PS4 controller via Bluetooth.
---
If you connect the Dualshock 4 via USB then the game recognizes it fine, even with the right icons for the button prompts. It is very weird.
---
Honestly my character just looks like an average joe who is a little older than I am presently. The only reason the helmet stays on is becuase it looks super good with my other armor and it would be a shame to break it up
---
Since you've reached Fabled, that step of the Triumph is locked in. Even if you end up falling below it, it won't matter. All you have to worry about now is getting those wins.
---
I miss when it would be arc burn, specialist Omnigul. Bubble Titan with Saint-14 and 3 Fourth Horseman would shred her in about 2 seconds. God, that was so much fun.
---
Yep. It's all about tactics and team fire. It usually takes me a game or two to get my aim and my groove going. I got the recluse in one day, 8hrs and 56 straight comp games. The first 5ish games I solo queued, never again lol
---
I didnt even know there was a chest...
---
You like to go boom huh?
---
I've been running a shotty. Snipes and high impact shotguns still instantly kill any guardian. Snipes are more warranted if you get a headshot. Supers you might have some trouble with. Shotties are good for being aggressive but can be inconsistent. Especially if you're not experienced with them or going up against a stack of 4+.
---
Jötunn is also good but you can miss. Fairly easily but still a great weapon. Another option is Mida.  It's super consistent right now and it feels stickier than it used to. Use shutdown supers aswell, you may not get 3+ kills but getting rid of a spectral, dawn blade or even a roaming fist will be more valuable to your team instead of getting one random guardian and then trading or not finding anyone.
---
Final tip, just play and aim to improve and have fun. Look at what you do wrong and dont blame teammates for everything. I know loads of players who do that and they get no where by doing that . Banner is a grind, it can be stressful but in the end you'll get there.
---
sometimes i am guilty of this, for example: a spider bounty requires you to do 2 public events (they dont have to be heroic) so i just melt the boss because its faster to just destroy him then make it heroic and THEN capture the boss.
---
He’s still doing the story mode

I wasn't on the moon or Mars cos the moon wasn't out at the time

I've mostly noticed it in gambit but also on the dreaming city I remember the thrall at the front of the blind well during the hive vs scorn event thing that happens their melees didn't proc the perk
---
And bud don't flash your thousands of hours around like a badge we've all played these games and honestly it's kind of cringy like claiming you're a "vet" because you've played since the first beta it's cringe inducing
---
Psssst. Don’t tell anyone.... also got demolitionist in a fusion...
---
*I think its pretty solid for typical gameplay but hey thats just me*
---
Eager to see skill play from hunters not jumping with shotguns. Cause thats all they do.
---
What’s your top base power? If you’ve already had 951s drop may have already adjusted up but shouldn’t bump up past your base if it is 950.
---
Is it bad I know that lighting png by heart
---
Riskrunner has been my favorite gun for years. It has always been swapped to whatever character I'm playing and literally no other exotic weapon has held my attention for long. It was my first exotic unlocked in D2, also. I never had the catalyst and when Shadowkeep launched and I found out I could do a quest to get a high power level Riskrunner and its Catalyst I was very excited. And I'm halfway to master working it now.
---
Yoinked my pic from twitter :^(
---
I already took your advice about 3 days ago and got recluse in one day
---
Xbox?
---
With nearly 16k kills on a RR, I'm happy more people have it, means I proc conductor more in crucible, plus the great gun it is

Engrams and recreating gear from Collections as far as I know.
---
its the graviton forfeit exotic helmet. the purple glow is from the majestic solstice armor from a previous festival event. if u mean the silverish glow on the chest its the gambit chrome shader
---
Im new to reddit I thought it was a share. That is my first post. GG
---
They're also used for pulling things from Collections
---
A state line
---
You'll have an armor piece of your level and you won't get a new one at 950. But it only costs 5 upgrade modules to bring the whole stuff to 950 once you're there, so it's far from being wasted.

Hello. New player here, I recently bought Forsaken and was on the fence of buying Shadowkeep just yet - already leveled up the "season" with some ranks - I was wondering, if I buy the Season Pass now - do I unlock the rewards from the past ranks I already completed or do I have to "feed" them XP all over again?
---
I hit the share button? Is that not how you share post?? It has the original poster for his credit? Is that not how Reddit works?
---
Well, it would probably start with 0 in the mag like in d1

Gotcha, I misunderstood your first comment then.

Look up Hookzee [Steam]/DredgenYor_Jr [PSN] on destiny tracker for proof

Try from your collection screen and not from the badge.

Nothing like getting the arc energy crackle that precedes the arc conductor activation, looking up, and see enemy legion before you...
---
This is also true.
---
Phoenix Battle Ornament from S2 applied
---
It's not the solution I look for but I appreciate the help.
---
Wheres our HHSuperNova nerf...
---
Just play for yourself lol
---
I feel attacked.
---
This. This is the attitude people need. Good for you. I wish hunter had more exotics like warlock. Celestial and stompees are the only ones I use. There are some good once but they are all gimmicky. But I’m just happy tether affects heavies again so I’m good for this season
---
They hated him because he told them the truth.
---
Literally any game before Destiny 2, especially on Steam, had these kinds of nicknames.
---
I just did not expect even Destiny 2 to turn into some shitty stand-up context.  
---
"LOOK THE GUY'S NAMED SCROTA, ITS LIKE CROTA BUT SCROTA CUZ SCROTUM HUEHUEHUEHUEHUEHUE"  
---
This joke was decent once and in Destiny 1.
---
Now it's just sad and irritating.
---
Recluse is a 3 hours grind from 0-2.4k. Why do people whine?
---
And let it be known, from this day forward, that Destiny PVP arena be known as THE CURCIBLE!
---
...I think you just started something!
---
Practice lol
---
Omg, where did you get that Little Light shirt? Also, u now have his first Halloween costume idea, make him your ghost.
---
Hitting legend is still ass.  You lose 70 points for every loss but only gain 40 on a win without a steak.  60 for a 2 streak.  So you need 3 win streaks just to net positive
---
Ok
---
No.
---
Not anymore
---
Wow you have low standards, that range should only be grenade launchers and sniper range but okei
---
I've just been wearing the full leafy boi outfit
---
What are you looking for then?
---
Kinky
---
Yea I noticed that about Hunters as I was leveling them. Ya'll dont have many "cool" or "great" exotics which sucks thats great that tether effects heavies again though I didnt even know about that!
---
Got it on etsy
---
Arc titans are already useless for PvE (endgame PvE at least). I say this sadly as a Titan main with \~65k kills in D2 as Striker.
---
I'm more bothered by the fact he cant keep the riskrunner at the NPC head. It is the size of a football.
---
Strange, I tend to be on top of both pvp matches and vanguard strikes as a warlock. Maybe you are warlocking wrong.
---
Imagine going to a vex mini raid and fall in love with a tree

They should honestly nuke our current towrr and fix the old one

no it just had one blue gun in it

Never really noticed before. But I'm struggling even in standard crucible, need to get back on the grind I guess
---
Iron banner has always been light level based, you'll get smoked if you're not within 30-40 of the other player.
---
Damn my PlayStation inferiority
---
I came from xbox and the load screens are terrible. Switching to pc and they are non-existant. But I used to just brows reddit or porn depending on the time lol.
---
And what happens when you need to kill a boss
---
This seems to be the solution. The game reconignizes that I am using a controller just fine.
---
Some of my controller commands get locked though and it does't register any new commads.
---
I am streaming over Fire TV 4k, so I am unsure if this is because of its possibly bad bluetooth chip or due to the software. I will try some local games on the TV Stick and find out. On what hardware are you streaming? Does someone else have this issue?
---
Have you tried the new moon auto? That’s nice. Hand cannons always out perform in pvp with a skilled hand. Autos need some love still in my opinion.
---
Sounds safe
---
this looks like an anime antagonist that is about to destroy the main character
---
Man this is making all my possible submissions look like a joke
---
Well what I mean is once I receive the pinnacle rewards from Iron Banner, can I hold off on redeeming them until 950 or will I get them as soon as I complete the requirements?
---
Agreed!
---
say "I was wrong"
---
Must be NICE doing all them 69’s at the age of 14
---
Legit just kill one dude and leave
---
i dont think its a helmet tbh
---
probably an ornament
---
that might actually explain it, I'm new to the game but this is the only explanation I can think of
---
Reload to another map
---
The boots are from the new raid
---
yeah i noticed this as well, try it on helm of saint-14... look like a crisp
---
Why people still upvote this fuckin repost is beyond me
---
Reload the game
---
I think if you do the year 1 campaign as a hunter, you can get quickfang.
---
Log out of that character and back in.
---
Check both vendors if they offer heroic adventures. I think you could get them from there.
---
Just sign out of your character and back in to it
---
Speaking as a Titan main, even. I've mostly given up on shoulder charge in the world of shotguns. If I'm even using a tree with a shoulder charge, it really only gets used as a fluke convenience or to slide corners and try to nab someone who is camping a doorway. It's actually pretty hard to nail someone "on cooldown", intentionally, with any kind of reliability. Easy to die trying to reach them.
---
Facts
---
(I am also a titan)
---
That's still really low res...
---
I’m not sure, I got mine ages ago but on earth, so I’m not too sure
---
Alright I did that, Im reinstalling the drivers
---
Yeeea I got it. Took a solid second day of grinding to finish that part lol
---
Hunter: There will be some strong enemies, so we better grab some guns
---
Warlock: We could use a strategic plan to make sure everyone survives
---
Titan: \*Naruto runs into a crowd of cursed thrall\*
---
You need to hit 2.100, get 100 wins on normal or about 50 on competitive then return to shaxx. If you have acquired the quests before they made them easy and try to complete those it won't progress/should be deleted and you need to get the new quest. Otherwise brobs a bug and relogging might help.
---
Eternal warrior? Seriously? The exotic is, putting it mildly, complete shit and has been even in the D1 days
---
Just turn in tokens and gunsmith mats. I have turned in 3k each vanguard and crucible and about 8k gunsmith mats and finally got traction yesterday it's all rng
---
Looks about the usual for me :(
---
Nice shot tho
---
You are not a clown, you are the entire circus.
---
Cowabunga it is.
---
I had seen something like this in a video on YouTube where a guy made a montage of him gunning down warlocks during blink. Apparently when blinking the entire "path" Of the warlock functions as a hitbox
---
Bold of you to assume he has spoken to a woman.
---
Why do you have to be so hurtful and so honest!
---
Why not?
---
Lol you beat me to it. This meme is exactly what I had in mind while doing the catalyst
---
"WILL. SOMEONE. PLEASE. GET. THIS. GUARDIAN. HIS. ... oh, nevermind."
---
Well it powers the orb up when you throw it to a teammate, sooooooooo
---
Congrats
---
They can also come from strikes. This week’s ordeal strike has an exotic shell as a reward for example
---
Theres other quest with Amanda Holliday at the tower
---
I mean, I dont really see all that much to complain about
---
How do you get that armor set?
---
If you run with a shotgun, that's your answer.  Shotgun to the face while you watch them coming in to you.  Typically I see them running.  I'm not good enough with a shotgun to make it work, but that's what I've seen other people do all the time.
---
How to you obtain such a gun?
---
And in the other corner, two babies with 3 guns!
---
Exit Strategy actually isn't that bad. It's almost as good as Recluse and can open up more builds that require the slot Recluse is in if necessary - ie, Divinity.
---
Wouldn't know, I spend all my time in the Crucible whipping flaming hammers at people.
---
ow reference
---
Yeah, RNG can be rough
---
Babayega...
---
the worst thing is the removal of the health regeneration after a kill, I know it is bad and I totally agree, but without it the tree will die in pve, the super barely has damage, so to regen with a kill while receiving all the stomps is essential. man if there is a way to make the perk works in pve and not pvp.
---
Lol I like how he’s looking at you like “tf you think you’re doing bro”
---
Out in space.
---
As a recluse user the entiril is annoying
---
:)
---
Oh shit
---
Skill based matchmaking is only in comp, regular crucible is connection strength based
---
Golden Gun does nothing but piss me off in Crucible. Maybe that'll help you.
---
Sorry. Basically, it used to be a gold color that was a similar color to the Titan’s mark. Oddly, the shader didn’t change the color of the mark at all but changed every other piece of the armor
---
Sauce is needed
---
#:)
---
DOUBLE DONK
---
A melee that one shots when specced correctly! The only class that can do it.... and it’s an AOE, only class that can do it, ya not cool. Having said that I run the same thing and have a blast doing it. But still thinks it’s unfair
---
At least I can still 1 hit melee full healthed guardians without melee ability being up 😜
---
Lol the only reason I survived.
---
I demand both Last Word and Insurmountable Skullfort or I'mma freak.

That's how metas work tho, whatever is meta is just whatever happens to be the best atm.

Twas, lol
---
Here’s how it used to look

They are Iron banner armors in the last seasons, before Shadowkeep.
---
No and yes
---
GoS right now is a joke and levi is not even worth mentioning, try using it in legend or master tier activites.
---
Hunter is extremely strong in PvP and pve
---
I don't know why, but I now want to see dismemberment in Destiny 2.
---
Oooo I’ve never actually run mid tree void - thanks for the thought!
---
The fact that you have to ask this question when Sunbreaker can throw flaming hammers shows you're unenlightened to the magic of throwing burning forging equipment at people.
---
Yes German is a funny language
---
No way to tell the exact event you just got to check the map and go to them
---
they are, the health regen was essential to counter all the stomps.
---
My buddy did 2 man riven and his pulse nades out damaged a celestial (he does pve/pvp recovs). Nothing wrong with top tree striker for pve, I use it as reaper in gambit prime, it rocks (approaching 32nd infamy reset)
---
I’m going for not forgotten now, I make this face
---
As heavy a nerf as it looks it really is deserving the spectral treatment it's getting
---
I thought it was methane.
---
Definitely! Please kill it bungie
---
Bout time, needed to happen. And that’s coming from a Titan.
---
Eh not really. All it was besides the primary burn was a max stability full auto scout. 
---
Full auto didn't provide any real benifit compared to any other scout in terms of non QoL effects, and the rest of the perks specced it for stability.
---
I'd argue hung jury was better besides the burn for most content
---
it wasn't from eververse, i was doing a legendary ordeal
---
it has the lowest damage in the game

thundercrush is pretty shit.
---
I've seen decent success with Crimson, but maybe because it heals on kills, so duelling stragglers isn't a chore that might get you killed.
---
Last Word is a quest exotic..
---
&gt;it wasn't from eververse, i was doing a Nightfall ordeal on legendary
---
We dont know anything soecificly about oem yet, just that bungie has their eye on it, a bottom striker is getting the duration cut, as dashing takes up more super energy and kills give less energy back. Pretty similar with dawnblade
---
I just want a destiny forge tbf.
---
broooo, i know what im talking about
---
       :)
---
It’s not bad, but If compared to Recluse it’s just another legendary with a great perk roll. 
---
I got a Menagerie shotgun with Trench Barrel in the primary slot and it’s an actual “exit strategy” ;)
---
This is amazing lmaoo
---
I mean, if the article being referenced here is “you”, then you aren’t another. You’re the same, but there is another Titan. Maybe do “me: dodges first titans shoulder charge. Also me: there is another
---
If you can stand it, even the sub rank ups in competitive pvp will give powerful drops.
---
Heh.. ha..HAHAHA. Hunters OP? 
---
Whatever you say. Can’t imagine what would be OP about a class that doesnt have 1 hit melee when the other 2 classes do. Our abilities dont do high damage and are mainly support, so what could possibly be op? Our supers? The thing we can only use one time then have to charge up while you go around one hit meleeing everyone AND have super?
---
Hunters have the biggest disadvantage, it’s better you just accept that fact.
---
ive done the legend version of the ordeal like seven times, and everytime i got an exotic it was a shell
---
# FIVE RAID BANNERS!
---
My life as a top tree gg hunter. My ass still hurts from the crucible last night.
---
Yeah another example of you having no idea what’s funny. Looking at your post history of poop jokes and considering YouTubers as comedy, yeah you have a gutter pallet when it comes to humor.  I’m happy to receive your downvotes.
---
2 were from the nightfall and the other was from the leviathan raid last crate
---
PC :)
---
What platform do you play on?
---
I guess I can try and give it a go after I get off work, I've been to shaxx multiple times though since I hit legend and he hasn't given me it yet. Hopefully I was just missing something
---
PC!
---
Recluse is next
---
What does that have to do with that, at least he.   ( or she)  is trying, and most definitely getting better. Congrats that you are good, but there are others that are still trying. They obviously have a life where they can’t play as much as someone like you in a basement or in a room all day, so stop talking shit to other people, and congratulate them for their achievements.
---
Oooh I see what you mean. That's stupid. It's rare to see someone do that but when it happens it's super frustrating.
---
You can buy shadowkeep and get the super but you can't get the gauntlets?
---
You maybe don’t have enough win percentage points as that’s part of the quest
---
The slight extra damage helps gun down even faster at least that I’ve noticed. Also the tracking helps to better position around turns.
---
I see what you’re saying, Would you at least agree that it’s a little ambiguous? It just as easily means another victim as it does another shoulder charge, just based on how it’s written and the image
---
Those crayon eating dumbasses could definitely use a lesson in "Look before you leap". What platform you on?
---
Jeez you guys are harsh... Take a joke. I know I'm no "one man army" my team won the match not just me, I figured after killing more than the entire team in a pretty cool way though I could boast a little but you guys are taking it way too seriously.
---
Ah ok. I'm on PS4. Good luck though! Enjoy!
---
I understand your points I guess what I'm really trying to figure out is whether or not to classify the paid dlc as a necessity in order to actually play the game in a meaningful capacity I mean if yes, then I would consider it free to try more than free to play. And just as an aside I'm curious whether or not  you guys think the game might be overly monetized, as in there's paid DLC and season pass and a s\*\*\* load of Evers micro transaction which feels a like it's a bit much in my opinion.
---
Was this on console or pc?
---
ps4
---
Still congrats man, just wait till you get a 50 kill streak, it’s really cool.
---
thwr is that one clip where the play of the game shows the dwarf dying and falling off the map while his turret gets a team kill
---
*sees new lights getting it for free*
---
THIS ISN'T A STARTER GUN, THIS IS A FINISHER GUN!
---
Not gonna lie, I did not know he voiced Bloo so I stand corrected at least for that. I'll correct my statement: I'm not a fan of the gravely voice that he does. It just doesn't have enough inflection for me. Reminds me of my monotone high school Spanish teacher.
---
Very nice
---
Well that sucks. I was gonna see if you'd be down for a little friendly 1v1.
---
Then u have to return them to ur teams gate. It's a thing sticking out the ground. Disappears from time to time tho. I'm fairly new also but there are 4 sides to the gate. Kinda looks like a small tower coming out of the ground. Go to 1 of the 4 sides and it'll prompt u to deposit motes.
---
No, just tune the OP ones so they fall in line with the rest.  Supers aren't fun when you're on the receiving end but they're fun when you're dishing it out.  Works for me.
---
nah
---
Idk why I got downvoted. You’re right
---
That's a world drop. World-line Zero is the exotic sword from a quest.
---
Black talon is not a quest exotic. Sorry to burst your bubble.
---
The detonation from middle tree Sentinel can kill large groups of enemies.  For example, groups of 2,3, and 4 guardians will most likely live but groups of 5 or 6 will probably die.  It’s like an arc web on warlock but less effective.
---
And if it’s already powered lol?
---
That makes any melee super useless
---
The overshield only last during the animation. It’s not worth it
---
You are a beautiful person
---
Is support sunbreaker any good with the new shared sunspot armor or.is it just straight up worse than code of the protector?
---
lol fair i mean i understand why saladman does but not reaper as much.
---
I feel like i saw this on r/destinyfashion before...
---
How would that work with a void bow or any other super or are you just only talking about striker titans?
---
I've never wanted the silver store to be open more so I can grab this set.
---
Golden gun has no damage resistance.  It’s fine. Shutdowns are fine.
---
Its also the best exotic to take into the Bergusia Forge
---
Any roamers
---
THIS IS AMAZING!!!
---
F
---
This guy blows kids, disgusting
---
All previous content is at a base 750 Power Lv, if I'm not mistaken. Everything on the Moon is of a higher Power.
---
Is golden gun a melee? The only usable supers would be golden gun hammers and dawn blade.
---
I dont think it applies to The Ordeal. I think it only applies to the Nighfalls in rotation
---
That's good question. I'm actually about to find out later this evening as my clan is going to rerun some of the old raids.
---
The thunderlord would have been perfect for this as it shoots literal lightning strikes from above when u kill something
---
You need the season pass/shadowkeep for it so yes
---
Thanks!
---
Uh, actually I think Borderlands and Destiny were both making the same reference here. Hyperion is one of Saturn's moons and a titan in Greek mythology.
---
I thought it was pretty sick honestly. Cool shit homie.
---
NUUUUUOOO! T°T I didn't start playing before the beginning of this year T_T 
---
Oh well....... gonna have to make due with Amethyst Veil for now 9_9
---
From the D2 wiki:
---
&gt; Guardians conquer Capture Points by standing on them while no enemies are in capture range. The process takes about 10 seconds and is not affected by the number of Guardians taking part in the capture.
---
I don't invade because I know others are better. I just beg players without motes to A) Kill the Blockers and 2. Hunt Invader. in both cases, this is to protect people carrying motes.
---
I'm tired of trying to kill 3 blockers while carrying 10+ motes and getting nut-punched by the invader
---
To be fair, the enemy team didn’t help by bunching together either
---
Ok.
---
Whichever Youtube tells you is OP /s. It’s your preference, all classes are viable. Except Sunspot Sunbreaker, I’ve just always found it underwhelming but you might disagree and that’s great! Not everyone needs to be running h the same everything
---
You’re supposed to be able to.
---
Getting plenty of mods, just most aren't enhanced. Keep in mind that you get each mod one time now - so if you have already picked a lot up from thing like running the nightfall, you won't have many left in the ol loot po
---
Are you around ? We're looking for a last to finish the quest as well
---
&gt;not CS:GO main menu
---
IDK about Black Ops 4 but Black Ops 3 had "supers" lol. They even had some that were obviously re-used from Destiny. They had a fist of havoc one, golden gun, a bow one minus the tether. So, Call of Duty it kind of is.
---
Yeah. I don't even care if their actually good or not - I'm not going to walk around with a bunch of leaves as a gun.
---
Only thing I’m grinding for- at rank 53... so close
---
Lolol "wipe" 
---
That word hurts when it's your fault.
---
Damn. Must’ve been that they are 2.0 not universal ornaments.
---
It was about time they did something about that broken super. Now OEM its next.
---
Your logic confuses me
---
Bruh where this is the destiny 2 sub
---
You just put your dirty boots on the crisp white bedsheets they just made.
---
The destiny 2 pc lfg discord has over 200k members, can find a group for anything at any time of day
---
Grifball is like rugby with swords and gravity hammers from halo3
---
You know what makes *me* scream?
---
*The damn Recluse.*
---
My hunter can finally get shards 
---
I'll probably stop playing my warlock again 
---
At least it'll get another character to 960
---
I won’t be buying shit I’ve already paid a good deal of money for this game and don’t care enough about aesthetics to spend more.
---
Too funny
---
For damage I actually prefer Orpheus Rogs+ bottom tree Nightstalker. I don’t have maths to prove it but I think it does more damage than Nighthawk, it’s just not instant. I like the neutral game of nightstalkers more
---
But I’m getting the other one in 2 weeks so the better deal is shadow keep for that free pass
---
Plan on doing it with my team later! Good luck!
---
Dude bright engrams you can still get them for free and they really don’t matter since it’s all cosmetic and it just seems you can’t accept bungies decision on free to play. Everyone is entitled to their option tho so have a good day
---
Pretty much everything more PvE than PvP though
---
EVERY TIME
---
What helmet is that?? Looks sick
---
Just got mine today! Did the comp part in about 4-5 hours, wasn't non stop, took breaks between matches to clear my head. I'm a scrub at PvP too, just do it. Luckily I already had the win portion unlocked thanks to iron banana this week.
---
If you have forsaken you can probably go to it from the director or get it from amanda. You do need to have bought forsaken tho
---
shoot the head and dead they will be
---
Agree to disagree man, I’m perfectly fine with that.
---
Chonk. But tasteful chonk, I love it
---
I tried tonight and got hard light (duplicate)...wanted Monte Carlo!!! &gt;:(
---
I meant what class?
---
Console players be like: “so?”
---
One is a slug, the other is a standard buckshot shotgun
---
If you have the catalyst it makes the range basically double, it really makes that weapon feel like an autorifle
---
Yeah, he is. I'm a Reaper main, and when I started playing Iron Banner I recognized his voice in a heartbeat. He has the range of a Piano when it comes to his voices.
---
I just unlocked it and I am in love in it.. It just shreds enemies I feel like Thorn with all those lighting around me hehe
---
You're the one who's crying here, you useless twat.  
---
 I'm just sick of seeing warlocks being opressed again for no real fucking reason. Everyone were ranting the most about titans, but warlocks got hit just because.   
---
They always have the least buffs and the most nerfs
---
You cant get monte carlo from that engram
---
Hunter, mainly void top tree...sometime blade barrage
---
Thanks. Are we related?
---
you can only get y2 weapons from a xur's fated engram
---
This is always the argument that comes up when a live service games either goes F2P or releases all its content in a reduced cost package. I honestly don't get this mindset at all.
---
Call me a Communist then (I'm not for what that's worth), as I don't see how this is a bad thing. I bought my license of the game, as did you, we (likely) clocked hundreds of hours of play time, and aside from the light bump bringing everyone to initial parity, we have a significant advantage compared to New Light players in the form of Exotics, Pinnacles, and some event Legendaries. 
---
Does the old content *really* have that much value at this point? I'm being completely honest. How often did anyone go into the Heroic Story playlist after a certain point in the power grind? I know I didn't for most of Y2. It's nice to play once or twice, but I finally spent my Power Boost on my Warlock since I didn't want to play through the Red War, CoO, and Warmind campaigns a third time.
---
Looks disgusting.
---
About 2 months before Shadowkeep I grinded some of the catalysts and this was one of them. Maybe I don’t use it because I burnt myself out. Will definitely try it with stormtrance or chaos reach.
---
I argued with some guy on the moon cos he said you only needed to kill the gate lords for the overlord to spawn.
---
At the end he’s like “Just wait, it’ll spawn” 
---
After 5 mins, he just said “What?? That’s never happened before” and left, if only that idiot just listed to me.
---
how is dodging support? what about any other super than tether and the other voidbow?
---
Noice...
---
We all give Rickkackis shit but let's be real Mtashed is just as bad as him
---
Word. Thank you sir.
---
I hate that you dont arrange your weapons lol
---
I've tried to max out the stats I like most with armor that has at least 35 total stats over recovery, discipline, and intellect.
---
I don't think the resist mods help you that much, but I've never tried them.
---
For mods, I like to have reserve mods, and mods that boost the 3 stats I like, as well as any cool mods from the seasonal artifact.
---
You aint missing much, its not worth the grind....at all!!
---
um
---
Use jotunn
---
Y1's Winterhart set has never been available since Winter 2017.
---
My favorite line was last season when I heard Saladin say, “Hunters, in the dark ages we called them... people with guns” lmao
---
Dodge is gonna save you so you can stay alive and support your team, but you tell me what class has the weakest abilities in terms of damage or self defense, please. Also, thise are supers. My whole point is that Hunters only offensive ability is their supers. Everything else just MAYBE saves your ass or helps your team a bit.
---
I always do it out of habit now, because if I dont there's always that low level red bar that thinks it's part of the secret service protecting the president and denies the throw.
---
Shrouded Stripes
---
That looks awesome
---
All SMGs got a boost, and everyone got Riskrunner from the mission, so just getting more  use because of that probably. Streamers running in for day 1 GoS may help it a little also.
---
&gt; The time to capture a flag will now always be the same no matter how many players are on it.
---
&gt; There are no benefits to having two players claiming the same Capture Point. Have one player do the actual capture, while a second player covers them from an appropriate position instead.
---
&gt; Don’t send more than one player in to capture a zone. Capturing takes the same time no matter if you’ve got one or four players in the zone.
---
Every source I find disagrees...
---
I disagree, I grinded for it and I am really happy with it in both pve and pvp. It takes some time to get used to it.
---
I remember the first time Iron Banner came out and I instantly recognised Lord Saladin’s voice as Reaper from Overwatch. What surprised me most is that there were lines that sounded exactly like Reaper even with all the modification Reaper’s voice has to make it sound ghostly. 
---
The fact that this voice line is in the game is hilarious.
---
thanks
---
Man, I love DOOM.
---
Ah yes. I remember that day. Got a very nice win streak.
---
Now THAT needs a nerf. Coming from another titan.
---
I haven’t seen Telesto in months
---
It's a vanguard weapon that will drop from engrams you get by turning in vanguard tokens for Stern Daddy Zavala. The pool of possible drops isn't too huge so it shouldn't be too much of a hassle. Run some strikes, get some tokens and hope for the best!
---
Do events with the dreambane armor?
---
Sucks 2 suck
---
I'm clueless and returning after a hiatus, can you point me towards some of your favorites?
---
*Machina collateral sounds*
---
1k owen voices
---
You should swap the helmet for the Shadow's mask from CoS Hunter Raid set
---
Yes because it averages out all people on the team. But the players you match with will be worse than you
---
^^:)
---
I got one to drop off a random wanted enemy in a strike lol shitty roll but it's still better than other legendarys. Been rocking chaperone for a little though and it kills pretty reliably with a little aim, try it out imo
---
Thanks for the hints..I am getting closer in my searches
---
d1 sleeper quest would like to have a word with you.
---
A Pinnacle in the hand is worth 3 in the bush. 
---
That's what she said,  giggity giggity.
---
Yes it is
---
I thought the rewards for these quests were supposed to be good!
---
Also to note for shotguns, You can quickly search on youtube for tests on multiplayer that range stat on shotguns is negligible... though now I wonder if shot spread is dictated by range stat.
---
Not meta, but definitely playable.
---
In PVE, pair it with ‘Top-Tree’ Arcstrider for both stunning and damaging enemies. It’s pretty fun.
---
Mostly on me if I recall lol
---
What is up guys 
---
# THICC RICC 
---
here.
---
tickle fingers more like UNLIMITED POWAAAAAAAA
---
Oh for a second I thought you stole this lmao but I saw you posted both that’s a nice looking titan by the way
---
Try r/fireteams as well
---
I think so
---
I laser beamed a thunder crash Titan just to fall into his aoe and instadie.
---
Lol! He’s talking about a bug that was going on. If you got super close to your target and shot it hurting yourself and the target, the target would take a ridiculous amount of damage.
---
I agree. I actually just bought the game two months ago just for the single player campaign. It had forsaken included.  Just Something to keep me busy till BL3 came out. I was in the middle of the campaign when the huge update came out. I was boosted to level 750 and have just finished the red war and only just all of the adventures in the EDZ.  I'm never going to finish this game lol
---
Holy hell, it's been two weeks and you're 100?! Is this shit your job? I thought I played quite a bit and I'm at like 25...
---
Pretty sure it means the Vex Set (“Substitutional Alloy” Armor Set).
---
It was less of a prank but just a joke the guy did to make people laugh and smile at his funeral
---
I found it.  Wow am I dumb.  I’ve been searching my pants slot not my class item.   Thank you for the help.   I forgot it was moved to class item.
---
Oh don't even get me started on that, it gave me freaking anxiety 😂 honest to god the happiest ganer moment when I finally got it
---
Lol welp
---
That hunter has balls. Didn't even pop into invis.
---
Oh, you mean he recorded it with his console and then filmed it with his cellphone...
---
This sounds overly complicated but it makes sense.
---
Salad out.
---
Bubble of Life.
---
I’d be fine if this was just the “Snowball” pic. Why the fuck did you put the comment with it...
---
Now it just kills upon aiming, don't even have to shoot
---
Yo, I'm at like 60ish. Then again I've done nothing but play Destiny since SK dropped.
---
No need for forsaken ?
---
Press Windows+Tab, create a second Desktop and start the Taskmanager there.
---
What system do you play on?
---
Laughed. But it's really not that bad. Mountaintop is muuuuch more annoying. Not to mention Last Word.
---
Oooooh... Interesting...
---
If u would have to pay for everything that is free now, price would b much higher... But to ur question - no discounts available. Forsaken will probly go down with price over time, but u would have to wait quite long time. Same goes for shadowkeep :)
---
PC
---
that part of the map is such a choke point. it's possible to wipe entire teams that decide to walk through the front door at the wrong time.
---
You don’t really need foresaken because if you buy foresaken you get some exotic quest and the raids so guess if you want the raids go for it
---
:(
---
You will miss out on Forsaken DLC weapons such as Izanagi’s Burden and others. The new stuff hasn’t dropped yet but you can at least enjoy Forsaken content in the mean time and buy the season pass at a later date.
---
only 36 in the mag. thats a no from me..
---
I tried it with this set, doesn’t work must be moon
---
Building a vex gate. Sounds like the worst idea ever.
---
Oh its a banner perk, ok i got you man cheers.
---
As far as I understand. That's what I'm doing since I'm only 932 at the moment. Gonna complete them but wait to turn 'em in until later.
---
It's possible I overlooked something, but I believe that's how it works.
---
Is well friendship? Which one is friendship
---
Indeed
---
Sounds alot like a git gud problem
---
Its all good mate
---
C spawn is closer to heavy
---
Its endgame content meant for endgame gear grinding the low level requirement is so anyone can try it and you can technically get some the bounties done to get stuff even tho you would be a detriment to your team.
---
Random drop unfortunately, I had to run ordeal for an hour before I got mine
---
Petition to delete these comments mentioning sweet business. It doesn't fire fast enough
---
This is reflex, before Shadowkeep, we were gaining extra def...well no more now 😐
---
Looking good guardian. Nice to see someone else enjoying the simpler things in Destiny too
---
Luckily you spawned with a "fuck your sword" weapon already equipped, dispatching that peepee head with a quick blast of electricity.
---
Iron banner tokens when used on Saladin has a high chance to drop mods in general, so you could try and farm there.
---
We should be able to trade it with the spider!
---
Can't wait to get home and acquire these from Xur
---
Why would you envy a pin
---
Are you new to the Destiny franchise? Been like that since D1.
---
I got mine after a nightmare hunt
---
Honestly having Iron banner at the perfect time helped as well cause a win gives like 5%.
---
That’s riiiight supers lost some deference I forgot about that. Well if he did have the extra I problem wouldn’t have killed him in time.
---
It’s random. You can trade in planetary materials, gunsmith materials, or crucible/vanguard tokens, I got mine from Shaxx but I got my scavenger mods from turning in simulation seeds.
---
I was waiting for you to get iced on some weird platform sticking out hahahaha
---
Not capping B was pretty iffy, but not capping C made me hurt.
---
settings&gt;key mapping
---
As an alternative, you can turn in these bounties now to level up faster and then next iron banner you will probably be at 950 and have a new batch to turn in as pinnacles. Mine dropped at 948 and really boosted up the level of my subsequent drops. I started this week at 935 and am now around 955 (with eye of gatelord bonus)
---
damn i didn't know that, i just did survival for the entire grind
---
No with that many kills he has a solution.
---
I give up trying to get this shit.
---
Yeah I got my Recluse like pretty fast like 2-3days tops for a casual.
---
So true! The grind used to be different. Idk how many times I got to 2000 glory and lost a couple matches in a row after that. I finally got to 2085 and waited for the reset to bump me up haha
---
I loved hearing that clip
---
Yeah, well is friendship
---
In the newest season, all players start/were boosted to 750 light level. This is the lowest possible light level in the game. As for quests: you can do what you want. If you purely wanna get to end-game, just Farm strikes and raise your power level to 900. If you want to relearn the game and do the beginner quests, hold “TAB” and then go the “Quests” section. Here you can find your quests. As for your skills: every skill is unlock able by default. You can use whatever allocation you want.
---
If you have any questions feel free to reply or PM me and I can add you on Steam.
---
Now go get Not Forgotten !
---
*nigh useless unless you don’t get 3 kills
---
MANBEARPIG!?!?!?
---
Yeah been playing since launch, never raided until a few days ago
---
In the "freelance" comp queue, yes. That's a big part of this quest becoming easier.
---
Nice!! 😲
---
c'mon man you can do it, i used hand cannons, outbreak perfected and scout rifles with an automatic mod  on it, it's doable I BELIEVE IN YOU
---
Calm down hunter virgin. I don’t talk to squeakers. And he definitely was a squeaker or has the iq of one much like u.
---
I never understood that Reaper voiceline
---
Ok so at the moment I’m only able to acquire 3 out of the 4 keys correct? And I have to wait till it gets fixed?
---
I think somewhere in the lore it suggests cayde went higher than 6 but stopped renaming himself higher
---
Was a real suprise when I got that one. Good news is the HIV I contracted while using one eyed mask has disappeared.
---
This has been a thing since the game came out it’s because near him is a scannable item for some lore
---
At what point should I get Forsaken? Should I finish whatever I can of the main game or it wouldn’t make much of a difference and I should get it now?
---
How about quit bitching and buy it or dont. Swear to god this sub is the most annoying place on the planet.
---
Ahhhhhh here we go. A comment you said yesterday: "people have different opinions." Wooooow. Look at that, you're also contradicting yourself as well😂
---
Well, it will be around 30 below your level, but you can infuse it with a armor that you don’t want.
---
You deleted the post because you're afraid of other peoples opinion, 🤦‍♂️. Then when you're backed into a corner you insult me, outstanding move chap. Continue with the denial that you're just plain better than me.
---
I’m not sure I’d call myself a fully paid player if you’re missing an expansion pack.
---
I deleted the post because I realized, yet again, how toxic and ignorant the people of reddit are.
---
Did they actually?
---
Yeah honestly there need to me be more earnable ornaments
---
Yeah, that's why I bought it. I looked it up online after I made this post and it said a reward was powerful gear. Themoreyouknow.gif
---
So long space cowboy :,)
---
V E N G E N C E  X 1 2
---
Cool thanks man 👍
---
Yeah but it's hard as fuck to earn bright dust 10 per repeatable bounties and 100 per weekly bounty
---
Yea thats true too
---
Not contradicting, sure this is you're opinion, but I can also use my *opinion* to tell you that in my *opinion* you're wrong.
---
I like to use a lot of politeness I guess???
---
Look at yourself. Its pathetic. You have to take jabs at everything you can ap that way you can seem so much better right? Why else would you bring up irrelevant as shit such as xim? Fucking loser. Go occupy yourself with something more productive.
---
There were no vendor resets this season so that armor should still be available thru crucible packages as 2.0 armor.
---
When is a hand cannon one shotting anything except precision hits on thralls and weak acolytes?
---
If you made it a 2 shot kill, there would be no reason to ever use it. [Here’s a video](https://twitter.com/iamcoolguyyt/status/1183085462610690051?s=21) from CoolGuy on how to fight it. Essentially just step right and don’t ads
---
It's the second time i see this post it's like dude there's kids around here and honestly this is fucking disgusting. Wtf !?
---
U get the NF quest after u get Luna's howl
---
You fucking idiot. Holy shit fo you know what opinion means? Telling someone they're wrong IS NOT an opinion. It's being an ignorant, condescending asshole. But hey, this is all you've got right? So you can have it and enjoy being the miserable toxic fuck that you are. Have a shitty life friend
---
You're continuing to comment which means that you still think you're in the right. I brought up the to back up my point that your BAD AT THE GAME  you have to use an adapter because CONSOLE PLAYERS ARE KICKING YOURE ASS
---
This has to be the most headass post I’ve ever seen bro. In what world are titans slow and we have some of the BEST supers for pvp lmao
---
I just played Gambit normally and got the medals now all I need is the kills which I won't go for
---
I'm on PC I DONT USE AN ADAPTER I USED A FUCKING ADAPTER TO GET PREPARED FOR PC WHEN CROSSAVE CAME OUT DO YOU NOTNINDERSTAND THAT YOU FUCKING IGNORANT IDIOT?!
---
Eh i guess i dont know enough about the the game to supply a response to that 🙃
---
Keep on commenting, keep on waiting your time it sure isn't valuable to you if you've got time to waste.
---
The rewards ARE pretty shit. I want more planetary resources than what we get.
---
Contradicting again! You're wasting your time too you fucking waste of life.
---
True tbh i forgot about that, i guess they both have their attributes
---
Second time? It gets posted a minimum of 6 times daily. More than that right after Shadowkeep launch. Meme is so fucking tired...
---
Is weekly story mission that strike? That chance every week. Tought its week long grind mission sounded awesome
---
deleted
---
