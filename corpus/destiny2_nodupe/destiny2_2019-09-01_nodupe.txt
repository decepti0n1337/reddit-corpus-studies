No you will not be able to access them via PC or Stadia. Any expansion bought fora certain platform will not carry over to all platforms. It must be bought for each one.

Where can I obtain this power?

F*** u and your love..

(*sobs inconsolably*)

Seriously tho, happy to hate-like ur happiness.
---
Thanks. I thought that, but a clan member pointed me to a post saying otherwise. Thanks again.
---
I don‚Äôt think you can,I think you need the corresponding dlcs to play on that platform.
---
For example I only have year 1 and vanilla game on PS4,but I own every dlcs plus annual pass on PC,I can play my PS4 account on PC,but I don‚Äôt think I can do that on PS4 since I don‚Äôt own some of the content.

The Meta is real.
---
I‚Äôve never had an exotic drop, and the catalyst at the exact moment. You lucky dog you.
---
It just seems like some want to complain for the sake of complaining...like the latest top posts are about the raid armor just being Y1 armor reskins. To me that seems highly unlikely since the armor was pure white..and if they were gonna reskin, it would be the skin from the D1 raid, which isn't a bad thing imo.
---
I may have my little complaints, but I'm mostly happy with where it's going. I might actually enjoy comp now that solo queuing will be a thing and gains/losses will be based on individual performance. Scouts are getting a buff (which my Night Watch is SO ready for), and Armor 2.0 looks awesome.
---
what gunnnnnnnnnnnnnn
---
Big ass knights in ascendant challenges, use a Tincture of Queensfoil to become ascendant
---
The dark blade looking knights maybe?
---
Same here, have had colorblind glasses for a while, but only recently played with them on. Looks incredible
---
You have to kill the huge knights in the ascendant challenge
---
Cuboid ARUUUUuuuu
---
There's no resisting a Titan's fisting.
---
Yep big knights in the ascendant challenge. You'll already be ascendant to get in there. But you just have to wait for the challenge that let's you kill them.
---
Subbing to r/titanfall is always a good decision tho

Spam it I guess haha I can usually get 4 good ones out.

Do you mean Riskrunner?

What about the disciples on mercury
---
That‚Äôs the smart way to introduce gay people. Not by just retconning all the lore and just announcing them as gay to the world but just having it there and not the greatest event. Bungie thonk smurt
---
So... You want riskrunner?
---
Zhalo Supercell would be nice, we don't need another hand cannon exotic.  
---
The two things I'm holding out on are No Land Beyond and Red Death. Everyone just says "Oh but you have Crimson" and it's not the same, not at all.
---
That ending was amazing
---
Not 100% sure, but I believe all three portions are being reduced by 50%, but will not affect your progress. So if it is 100 kills and you have 40 done, after the adjustment you will only need 10 more.
---
My best guess is that humans arent durable/useful enough, probably not worth the effort
---
You can type the same thing into Google and get the answer immediately.
---
Synthoceps because moar punch.
---
It's because it's the most like an FPS class with it's jump and class ability and grenades, it takes a little less time to learn the abilities but more skill to play over all

Destiny 1 has literally no story. You missed nothing

You haven't seen destiny 2 until you saw a sunbreaker with oem

Thank you for watching it!! üíô

Thanks. Now im hoping to solo this lol already failed twice due to time

But that's not how it works. It marks them AFTER they damage you. Then, if you kill the marked individual you get a brief overshield and damage buff.

God fucking damn people on this sub are stupid motherfuckers.

You will have to buy the game and dlc on pc and any other console you play on, console licenses are different and separate from battle or steam, from my understanding at least.
---
Handle and chamber look weird
---
Props, but you could've just waited until Tuesday when they cut the requirements in half
---
I know
---
So do I need all the previous DLCs or would I be fine without them?
---
Its not bad but id use bigger paper or scale down your drawing so you have more room to work with
---
I don't quit out, sometimes I give up, don't push, will fight when the other team come for me but sometimes after watching your team mates run one after another, life after life right at the opposition, or never cap zones or go for the objective. It just kills my enthusiasm to watch my team just feed the enemy.
---
I (God tier team mates) have won a few uneven games my team 2/3 versus 4 and won, by playing smart staying together team shooting, running away to my team mate when I am about lose the fight so they can kill them.
---
Playing sentinel titan with ward of dawn and dropping the bubble around teammates just in time to tank instakill.
---
To clarify I suck at crucible especially quick play but find comp and iron banner much more enjoyable as it seems "slower" with teams being tactical and playing together for the objective/win.
---
Unpopular opinion Control in comp is my favourite, maybe cos I go for zones over kills and my god mates murder everyone with bonus points due to my capping zones
---
Steps to obtain Whisper of The Worm:
---
-Go to Lost Oasis on Io
---
-Wait until any public event spawns in that area
---
-A boss will spawn in one of three areas; a taken captain in a cave by the lost sector, a taken knight on a cliff by the lost sector, or a taken centurion in a cave near the entrance to The Rupture
---
-After you kill the boss, a portal will open on top of a plataeu. 
---
-Enter the portal, then complete the mission
---
Yup, PS4. My PSN is SmugMustard
---
Jesus... how did you get her to play? My girl doesn‚Äôt even want to play.
---
Oh wow. Thanks for all the info! That's amazing and great advice to work with! Thank you so much!
---
You find the boss and kill it, then the portal opens in the middle of the area. Jump into it and the quest begins. It's a long platforming puzzle followed by some rooms of enemies
---
Why?
---
That ur opinion is wrong
---
Destiny2 everything up to forsaken will be free, but you will need to purchase forsaken and the annual pass as well as shadowkeep on all platforms you intend to play on...once again this is from my understanding. I purchased d2/forsaken/and annual pass on pc today(ps4 player here) and so i can spend the next month getting more used to mouse&amp;keyboard.
---
Rampage/kill clip shot? Maybe? just guessing
---
Been getting non stop terrible teams? Thats my main issue. I got 3 damn mercy rules last night because im the only one who can get more than 10 kills lol
---
Does the store accept paypal?
---
What's your instagram man? I will add you. Mine is, catzlover4life, hahah I know manly as hell. Yeah dude just always keep in mind MANY famous artists or professionals are miserable because all they care about is money and fame. Which imo are a waste of time to go after. I'm a Christian and Jesus even stated to not be of the world, it's a waste of time and you are dust in the wind at the end of the day haha. I get it, we are artist, we want the recognition, I get it haha. Just never lose that spark and joy that made you want to do it. I took 2 years break from my channel, yes it hurt my channel to this day but after coming out an abusive relationship, my best friends stabbing me in the back, and losing my favorite band of 6 years, I was hurt like crazy. Always put your happiness first, no one else will.

I'AM NEW TO THIS REDDIT ATMOSPHERE AND ALL THIS UPVOTES ARE MAKING ME THE HAPPIEST GUARDIAN RIGHT NOW, THANK YOU!

---
Hey man om ready but I need your gamer tG
---
I dont get it.
---
Can someone explain?
---
Because its pinnacle endgame content that has never had reskinned armour before (excluding lairs) and is a very bad sign
---
Wha
---
Oh my bad, I had left work when I read this quickly üòÇ
---
Same
---
No one knows yet. Bungie hasn‚Äôt specified.
---
Go to Bungie Forums &gt; [search] Fallen Of The East Star.
---
We are mostly US and UK but have members from South America, Eastern Europe, and Australia. We even have a few people that are deaf / mute and we‚Äôve played fine with them in all aspects of D2, including Raids. 
---
Check us out, you won‚Äôt be disappointed.
---
Previous quest changes make it seem like the number required will go down while the number you have will stay the same. For instance, when they changed the amount of grenade kills in IB my quest step auto completed.
---
I Saw one guy complaining about getting New exotics and that's why he preffered D2 Y1 because
---
Where the fuck do i find people/groups to do this, god i miss doing shit like this
---
Indeed üòÅ
---
I know that? 
---
I mean we dont need another exotic hand cannon as in we dont need them to bring back another one like Last Word or Thorn, or keep adding new ones like Malfeasance and the new one in Shadowkeep. There's 24 exotic primary weapons and 8 of them are hand cannons.
---
I swear its the only Titan exotic I have! Once I have Ursa Furiosa I'll dismantle it!
---
All exotic armor will covert to 2.0. 
---
You‚Äôll have to re-buy all the pieces from your collections for it to be 2.0
---
How so? Theres only going to be two unique armour sets it seems. 50% of the new armour is stuck in MX
---
That‚Äôs because Hunter is the most played class generally. Many people stick to their main in PvP rather than switching based on meta
---
i thought you were gay b/c you use reddit
---
imagine getting a nickle for every "boohoo OEM" post...
---
You do not need the current annual pass if you don‚Äôt want to. You can play Shadowkeep and year 3 annual pass without buying year 2 annual pass.
---
I did thanks a million.
---
just instantaneously
---
Cool will give it a shot. Thanks.

This video makes me want titans to have a one-two punch melee

WHA-

did you just assume my gender??

All perks are equal, but some perks are more equal than others.
---
It‚Äôs a grind. Only problem is I‚Äôm having trouble pulling myself of from playing Remnant.
---
I have started using it (sadly) only to not get destroyed every game (it has become a necessity)
---
i have 4 weeks of school before i can play shadowkeep :(
---
Everybody hates on everybody that's just life
---
got my gf into destiny (wasn‚Äôt hard, she plays a lot of video games) and we usually play together so i can carry her because i‚Äôm several hundred light higher than her (i‚Äôm only like 650 because i‚Äôm not a super serious player) well now i went on holiday for basically all of solstice and she‚Äôs completed the whole thing and is both stronger and cooler looking than me. wasn‚Äôt factoring that in
---
Lol that would be awesome
---
What‚Äôs a ut uber?
---
Yes. Pre order now for goodies.
---
Forsaken gives you access to the story missions and the last wish raid.
---
The annual pass gives you access to the black armory  forges, scourge of the past raid, gambit prime, and the menagerie.
---
Basically, forsaken = story, annual pass = gamemodes.
---
Personally, i enjoy the story missions, and think the collection is worth it.
---
I have more blade barrage kills on my titan than on my hunger
---
F
---
How much money does it cost and what extras do you get
---
Nothing more satisfying than getting clapped in a game but then getting good at the game to clap those who clapped you
---
U serious? Youtuber "Utuber".. ü§î
---
I thought that the annual pass was included in the forsaken complete collection
---
I'll trade you mine for sweet business catalyst. 
---
FUCK the bullshit of getting kills from the orbs that were nerfed into uselessness.
---
I feel like titans are way too easy in crucible. They have so many abilities that makes it kinda shitty for the receiving end
---
I think it was the Drifter. He was rezzed during the dark age, his ghost told him to go to where he had friends, he ran in the opposite direction.
---
Wholesome
---
You are right. I just thought you were considering buying basic forsaken.
---
Finally someone makes a meme out of it
---
Lol. I think they would be a strong combo, especially if you run Nezarec's Sin for the energy charge from Recluse/Hammerhead kills. Those will both charge your super as will Bad Juju.
---
Nah, I figure I might as well go all in and just get the full version of it
---
My guy and I have the same setup... We played Destiny together for over a year prior to dating and now we're living together playing in the same room, daily. #Fireteam4Life lol
---
Im not sure if i posted correctly. I'm bad at reddit.
---
Ever heard of a....
---
#joke
---
I think you forgot the bit where a Striker Titan chased you down for the entirety of the video, smashing you to pieces every chance they got. üòÇ
---
Also, I get the idea, but to offer some constructive feedback, the shooting bits could be improved (they are very inaccurate and static) and I'm not sure about the random teleporting such a long distance part that just isn't possible, nor the need to see the subclass menu. Something like this born out of the lore would be really cool, this, however, does just seem a little bit like a Warlock main PR piece. Like "Oh OEM Titans suck, Warlocks are so much smarter and more powerful", yet you leave out the Strikers most powerful PvP class? Doesn't make all that much sense IMO... 
---
I main a Hunter, but I don't subscribe to any of this master race bullshit - it comes across as a little arrogant and disrespectful. People should just be able to pick what they want. If it's broken, that's on Bungie, not them!
---
The Minimum Distance kinetic sidearm is about as close as you can get, slam a Metallic Crucible shader on it
---
I feel ya dude. That quest is a grind. Good job completing it though.
---
Meanwhile in PVE the same super doesn‚Äôt hold a candle to the power that some of the others have on larger and tougher enemies. Literally against riven, ‚Äúuhh I‚Äôll use double pulse grenades‚Äù. 
---
As someone who plays all classes. They all have moments to really take hold and shine. It‚Äôs give and take. 
---
I‚Äôm personally more upset my titan is lackluster at best in PVE encounters with meaningless jobs while other ones are far more effective.
---
Yeah I get that. It‚Äôll be something to play while we wait though haha
---
And ppl say that striker is OP
---
Six shooter is fun, but there is no better feeling to me than celestialing someone out of super when they charge me thinking I need more than one hit.
---
Congrats man! You lasted through the roughest content in the game and are still positive!
---
uhhh
---
Rip
---
Does no one see that this is a joke? Everyone is so aggresive
---
Why can‚Äôt we have flexible schedules, like you get to do it whenever you want aslong as it gets done
---
Good night!
---
i used that whenever i have to deal with thralls
---
Recently versed a full team of striker titans in quick play, I wanted to break my monitor after that game lmao.
---
I never asked for destiny 2. I asked for D1 to come to PC.
---
Because that's a really flawed system lol

TORTURE DANCE EMOTE OH MY GOD!

My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.

‚ÄòWanna see what I can do with my docked arm?‚Äô

No voice delay

I've tried oem in 2 matches and even they we're mayhem so I didn't do much and it just felt weird like kinda cluncky almost
---
But seriously, do you know how?
---
Forreal, I‚Äôm excited as can be and even though it sucks that some of our pinnacle achievements won‚Äôt be entirely unique rewards, there is sooooo much content coming that I wish people would relax and wait to harshly criticize after shadowkeep actually drops.
---
Lol. Then " I'm not playing that anymore"
---
I dont get the Gambit hate i fucking love it.
---
I really dont get the Gambit hate i absolutely love it.
---
Its SBMM so you are playing players of an equalish skill level, unfortunately the better you are the sweatier it becomes. 
---
IB for me is an absolute sweatfest.
---
HA! Jokes's on you I still don't have forsaken!
---
i7 is plenty, and a Nvidia 1070 GTX 8GB with 16gb RAM is running highest settings on mine at 72fps and 105 FOV.
---
Go to 4K I‚Äôd have to go to minimum 1080ti or a 2070ti or it‚Äôll fall over.
---
Just because titans aren‚Äôt good in PVE it doesn‚Äôt justify the whole of the crucible being completely broken
---
I‚Äôve always been envious of that move, you ever deflected someone‚Äôs shot back and get them?
---
I‚Äôm getting a 1060 GTX 6gb. Would that be good for constant 60fps. I‚Äôm mostly gonna play crucible
---
That clip is the reason why I have always wanted a playlist without supers. Even if you had no thumbs you could get lucky with a blade barrage like this one.
---
Someone I know got perma banned for this.... I‚Äôd be careful now.
---
please tell me that the guardian on the right is a titan,because that armor is probably the most sexy looking armor i have ever seen
---
 Virgin

Haha really cool

Exactly what I did. Got all my pulse rifle kills for Redrix in about six games with this muppets and finished my bad juju cats in the process :)

You'd have less money then getting one for the post
---
Dlc activities are locked unless you rebuy them on the new console you switch to but the weapons and armor you've obtained are useable because they are tied to your account which transfers via crossave. 
---
So if you have forsaken weapons you can use them but unless you bought dlc expansion on that console you don't have access to the activities
---
We found the Alpha titan,the new Leader of the Titan Vanguard
---
Zavala GTFO,now we have the true leader of our kind, the Son of Saint-14
---
Bullshit
---
Then ban macros? Most anticheats pick up macros as cheating did to the injectors.
---
Peacekeepers + double SMG, specially when comboing a precision one (such as Antiope) with a lightweight one.
---
Enjoy strafing at the speed of sound and having quickdraw, enhanced auto-loading holster and snapshot on both your SMGs on top of the rest of your perks. This shit is soooo much fun and I'd never change it for something like OEM.
---
Just please dont pair Antiope with Recluse, it feels dirty (borderline OP)
---
Great points. But Nothing Manacles isn‚Äôt in D2... And for top players Strikers aren‚Äôt so much of a problem but for the vast majority of players that shit is over the top. You‚Äôre right that Strikers don‚Äôt have an exotic that extends super duration, bottom tree just has that built in with health regen on kill. Let‚Äôs see how the super plays once super armor has been reduced but if any super had their super extended and health regenerate on kill it would be over the top. Maybe leave the health regen with the melee only don‚Äôt let the melee heal perk affect the super kills. Just as OEM no longer affects super kills.
---
yade yade daze
---
From any frame and only 2 times per character per week right?
---
Yea, OEM isnt that bad but striker super is busted and matchmaking doesnt work.
---
more like 500 and i still love it
---
yessir, and I'm loving every minute of it!
---
Nice good to have you aboard guardian
---
A good thing to know when facing a golden gun is they have literally no extra shields. If you can commit and they‚Äôre bad at aiming or if they‚Äôre facing a different direction, you should be able to kill them quick.
---
Appreciate it!
---
The noob harvest will be glorious!
---
Just wow. Stunning. Thank you
---
Awesome, got my bf to play with me after we moved in together. He got a chance to actually watch me play and wanted to try. He doesn‚Äôt have the patience for the grind, but he gets on to play with me from time to time.
---
KIRRA QUEEN, DAISAN NO BAKUDAN, BITES ZA DUSTO!
---
And just like in the source material, the newbie brings up that they are brand new, but you still fucking destroy them without so much as a care.
---
You are everything wrong with gaming
---
Props to you man, I just can't do it anymore. If somebody put a gun to my head to force me to play Gambit, I'd have to seriously consider how much my children need me in their life.
---
Open all chests on the barge. 2250 imperials/w
---
But the buff Werner sells, you can only buy 3 in a week, and they guarantee 500 imperials. 1500/w
---
Do all treasure maps. 400/w
---
Completing treasure maps also unlocks triumphs which grant imperials one time. Up to 2000/w depending on what you have and haven‚Äôt completed.
---
Menagerie, regular and heroic, triumphs unlock 500 imperials. Weekly amount depend on how well you do.
---
The rest, if you don‚Äôt get what you need from menagerie are gonna have to be random drops from activists. Make sure you have middle rune in the bottom right hand activated as this is needed for imperials to drop randomly.
---
Oh, fml

#VERY INTERESTING

That three piece was utterly disgusting.

Yeah it's pretty repetitive but i though I'd join in on the fun.

You're nice.

The hell? Did the Trickster had anything to do with Riven‚Äôs heart?
---
Oh my god... comp is gonna be so much easier! I‚Äôll finally get my pinnacle weapons!
---
Hmm DestinyTheGame subreddit was pretty big on the 2 Strike and 2 PVP maps thing but ok.
---
I've saw a big hype to shadowkeep at the begining, and now people are just more meh and meh about it.
---
I know i'm not hyped anymore. Way too much focus on Eververse than the In-Game loot lately for Bungie.
---
In b4 all of the post about "crucible is trash" post about getting killed by people with actual stuff
---
I like how her character actually looks embarrassed to be fist-bumping you :)
---
Getting mapped by yet another Erentil FR4. 
---
I mean, I was using a Pulse Rifle at range, but you earned that emote. 
---
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay...
---
I hope you reported them
---
It's because of well of radiance... He spawned right in it.
---
HOW?
---
Done that, still can't hand it in. And did the same on my other characters.
---
H m
---
Yup, still doesn't work.
---
Hell even dawnblade never seems to end
---
With the fact dmg said they're giving us "more info" in regards to raid armor, I'm almost willing to lay money they've got something up their sleeve. Be it ornaments for the challenge modes or maybe it changes at full masterwork like Wrath guns did when you leveled them.
---
Wether we wanted it or not...
---
Should have a pursuit.
---
It was available in SoD, might be available in Best if Ywar 2 engram
---
Congratulations!
---
No. There is no cross play in destiny
---
Maybe if you know how to read, you'll find out they will be matched against each other.
---
Remember the part where Luke said new swimmers will be separated from the Olympians? Although 99% of these Olympians are just as bad as these new swimmers lmao.
---
Spectral Blades
---
Does that engram exist?
---
I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm wrong but they look a little different. In the link you gave, look at the panel on the very right. The look at the panel on the very right in the image above. There is more sky on the image that OP posted than the one in your link. 
---
Or I could just be wrong and they are the same thing.
---
Then why is it moving form battle.net over to steam then?
---
OP just flipped the image.  Compare the opposite sides.
---
The grind'd kill me about as fast as it'd kill the bosses. I'll take less optimal damage over still enjoying PvP to some extent any day.
---
your question has nothing to do with cross play. It's moving because they are no longer partners with Activision/blizzard so they decided that transferring to steam would be better for the game.
---
Bungie is no longer with activision, and activision is battlenet, so they need a new home on pc. So the game is moving from battlenet to steam and being removed from battlenet
---
Bungie separated from Activision/Blizzard.
---
Also Mountaintop, Not Forgotten doesn‚Äôt count
---
I think it's a bug. I've had it a few times as well.
---
Thatd be broken AF in Crucible...
---
First one added forges where you could pick what fun you got as a reward the second one added a new Gambit me ode and another mode called reconkoning and you could get gear in that mode to make you better in Gambit prime. And the 3rd one added a new 6 man pve mode on the Leviathan that you could pick your loot as well as the masterworks it could drop with. Also what is wrong with adding more guns and loot? This game is a LOOTER SHOOTER afterall
---
Dead Huntard? Always a good thing.
---
If you can‚Äôt beat the autist be the autist. Just make a Titan and run it.
---
I mean, can he really be mad at someone making that shot? I'm impressed rather than annoyed if I get sniped mid-shoulder charge
---
Ohohoh. I can't wait to see what you do with that ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
The mindless hunter brigade disagrees!
---
I have a moral objection to that.

*Proceeds to get 7th column with Wardcliff Coil*
---
I love how bungie rewarded you too, 1 baryon bough and a future imperfect
---
I just want Geomag Stabilizers. It‚Äôs all I‚Äôve ever wanted.
---
There is nothing wrong with adding more loot. But it‚Äôs not the only reason for me to play since I would just do the same stuff to Unlock different stuff. I like when new modes, areas , and stuff get added so I also have new content to use my gear on. The third one sounds interesting. Thanks:). Didn‚Äôt hear anything about it
---
It can‚Äôt happen in crucible because it revolves around you holding your masterworked weapon through a loading zone.
---
It most probably gonna auto complete when you login after the patch just like the IB Questline nerf.
---
Dude he was straight selling them like a month ago lol
---
It definitely happens on PS4. From one end fo midtown's main street to the other as you respawn and they still have charge left to lob a couple of swords!
---
I actually main it. It's by far one of the most fun guns to use, and the only real downsides are terrible bullet magnetism and no perks. But imo perks are just add ons that aren't always make or break
---
I know the name and the cursed being that wears it, but not its notorious function, my bad B
---
And nova has a way bigger radius plus strong tracking.
---
I‚Äôm just saying. Chap and arcstrider are pretty far from meta right now. Points to people who can execute them well, as a warlock main when I play hunter spectral is much more forgiving
---
spectral also doesn‚Äôt have hit registration, they gave it like an extra 20 meters of range lol. couple that with the same melee mashing that bladedancer was and ofc spectral is gonna be more forgiving. chaperone is **definitely meta** right now, I dunno what game modes you‚Äôre playing
---
Nice.
---
We will have to see how it plays out.
---
Yeah recluse is amazing but its also a pain in the ass to get, for me at least
---
I recently saw a post on destiny lfg, guy looking to do sofp with requirement for 30+ clears checked his stats in raiding he was consistently in the last 3in any raid he did. He could just be honest and say looking for carry
---
No, see how the quest says **pick up.** This means only exotics that drop on the ground as an actual item that you walk over will count. 
---
It does not have to be on Nessus. It does not require you to use Drang. You just have to pick up either an exotic or a catalyst that drop as physical items and don't teleport into your inventory like Xur's items do. 
---
The best way would be the Eater of Worlds raid lair.
---
Or Lion Rampant
---
Hell yeah. Don't sleep on phasewalk
---
Yes. Oh yes.
---
He had it made. He didnt make it in the past
---
Vanilla Destiny 2, CoO, Warmind and Forsaken, as well as all Annual Pass content that you bought from Activision/Blizzard will appear in your Steam library ONLY if you perform the Steam migration  that was enabled a couple weeks ago.  
---
MAny Destiny related purchases made on either PlayStation or XBox will NOT be available on PC (regardless of Blizzard Launcher or Steam) for transfer. 
---
IF you do not currently own Destiny 2 + all DLCs + Forsaken + Annual Pass and you plan on having all available Destiny content on day 1 of Shadowkeep launch you will have to purchase (ON YOUR PC) the Destiny 2 + Forsaken package as well as Shadowkeep. 
---
The reason behind this is that the FTP version of Destiny 2, ‚ÄòNew Light‚Äô, will not include key components of the Forsaken expansion experience such as the Last Wish, SotP, and Crown of Sorrows raids, as well as specific exotic quests. 
---
TL:DR 
---
Yes, but you have to have a Steam account, purchase/own the current version of Destiny 2, and you have to manually do a Steam migration.
---
Believe me, you won‚Äôt have time to blink.
---
Yep might finally get my Chaperone lol
---
On your account yes and I believe (don't quote me) if you link up your accounts in Bungie and go to PC and do the same the DLCs may cross over, I'm not 100% but that's how I'd imagine it would work the only thing you'd have to buy is the base game again
---
You don't need to get all 3 resets in one season, but 3 resets total is the only way to get it.
---
I wanna know who started that lol
---
Is the triumph for the title going away after season 7?
---
#OH DEAR GOD!!!!!
---
And I thought CoD players would be an issue 
---
Then again!!! Fortnite is 3rd person, right? And people spam build, right? You can't do EITHER in D2 *laughs evily*
---
No, why would it? Triumphs that go away clearly state on them "available during season 7." You should see that none of the Dredgen title triumphs have that message.
---
One word, swords
---
I‚Äôm currently level 30 and i heard to get to level 50 i need forsaken however i wanna get shadowkeep instead and i heard there‚Äôs a new light system am i gonna need both shadowkeep and forsaken to be max level when shadowkeep comes out ? Sorry if this was answered I‚Äôm trying to get back into destiny. I just don‚Äôt wanna buy forsaken and i get no use of it.
---
Welcome guardian
---
You have to buy it again, or bring the pc over
---
Oooh *laughs in Black Talon*
---
I already bought it on Xbox once, enabled cross save and now it‚Äôs gone. So basically I have to buy it again just because I enabled the cross save feature? That seems like a little bit of a rip off lol I‚Äôll just wait until October then I guess
---
thanks makes sense, I will just try the free to play content on oct 1 and if i enjoy it i will the buy the dlc.
---
Xbox?
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
Me after a long day at work
---
Malfeasance I got in accident when doing Solstice Gambit matches, Truth I got from a drop Trust from Crucible I believe and Black Talon from a drop and the Tatarza Gaze sniper from Black Armoury

Hunters, please use something other than Stompees and a shotgun. 
---

---
My nips are getting hard over the thought of some destiny machinima
---
My stompees have traction. They are my favorite exotic. :)
---
Pretty sure, this is the picture beside the definition for the word, Clapped.....
---
People who have the expansion and season pass have much better weapons. However it is highly recommended to play it regardless because it will drop cool weapons and gear. You will be also able to buy some great shaders from Shaxx and get some by dismantling his stuff.       
---
Usually I am being killed with the same guns over and over again. Jot√ºnn, Ace of spades, Lord of wolves, etc. These are weapons we base gamers have no access to. In my opinion you will have lots of disadvantage because the Forsaken guns are much better, you can still have lots of fun in this mode, just don't take it too seriously.
---
AFK forge farm? Recently just got back into the game after over a year. Sorry for the silly question.
---
What do you need to buy them from Spider? Spider only unlocks after a few missions from Forsaken get completed?
---
I can play that game too, my One-Eyed Mask has Pump Action. Want me to put it on?
---
I was trying to see the crit stats with that handcannon I just got. I‚Äôve been playing since vanilla D1.
---
Definitly. Though I never use a shotgun, so there's that. Ringing nail and a hand cannon for me.
---
pretty funny ngl
---
Yes, I don‚Äôt want to buy both it and borderlands 3, and feel like BL3 is much more likely to be worth it. I‚Äôm a longtime bl and destiny fan so this is a really hard one for me
---

I never see strikers in gambit... its just not where the build shines
---
Your flair tells us everything, and ok, it‚Äôs not like 85% of the player base is on console anyway, but whatever
---
Regardless uh...are we gonna talk about crouch spam to win? Hold aim and be unkillable? Two stage Nuclear bomb super? Instakill at any range super? No? Cross map in 2 seconds sword? Relentless tracking nuke? Teleporting laser beams? Invisible arc web? No? Just the titan slam? Ok
---
I would like to apologize on behalf of my class
---
I'm just trying to avoid people from thinking that they need to pay money for the "Battle Pass". The "Battle Pass" is free to everyone with the free track, only the Premium Track costs the 10$ you need to pay for the Season Pass and you get a lot more than just the "Battle Pass". 
---
Sorry if I sound as if I'm trying to disagree with your post, in the end it is some sort of "Battle Pass" but it is not something you need to buy separately from the Season Pass.
---
Boo hoo, someone is using an exotic to its full potential.
---
I hate free comp help.
---
No I know I just didn‚Äòt know how and forgot that you could look at results later so I took my phone out and posted right away. So my bad.
---
*looks at opponents load-outs*
---
"Hmm I wonder what a Super Mod does it must be really good since they all have it"
---
\-top, the strongest dps weapon
---
1. Yes
---
2. Yes
---
3. It depends. Most of the stuff in the game you can get just by playing passively or working on quests in the background. Some stuff requires you to grind hard to earn them, but you don't need to get those items. 
---
4. If you mean customize how your face looks, then it's free, but can only be done once at the beginning of the game. If you mean armor-wise, a ton of the best looking gear does not come from eververse.
---
I think of it as a reskinned record book from ROI, after all we had that before any BR game had a battlepass. Which is free because its a seperate reward for buying the Season. So no one is paying exclusively for a ‚ÄúBattle Pass‚Äù that just isnt how it works.
---

---
Oh, sorry, I wasn't sure what you were asking. This infographic is referring to the Forsaken Complete Collection, which is currently the only way to get Forsaken and it comes with the annual pass. 
---
If you want the annual pass activities (drifter, forge, season of opulence) you need to buy it separately.
---
Whats a gambit bot?
---
Fifjwwo833e9k2b1owhfbe
---
Psn lfgs be crazy oh my
---
Currently, I don't think so. But in shadowkeep there's going to be a best of year 2 engram so it will probably be in there
---
I think we have been bamboozle
---
1) If you don't buy Forsaken or the older Annual pass, you will basically not be able to do the Last Wish, Scourge of the Past or Crown of Sorrows raids, and activities like Blind well.
---
Strikes and destinations will be available for you
---
2) Yes, completely. Just don't play it, if its not your bag.
---
3) Depends what you want out of the game. You can play the game "casually" and still progress at a fair rate through efficient play. You certainly don't have to non-life it.
---
4) No idea, I don't know what's cool for you. However, I have never bought armour from Eververse. Ever. With the new battle pass (?) Coming out, you can earn those rewards through play, anyway. Outside of Eververse there is an awful lot of armour available to collect. What you like is subjective though.
---
Long and short is, grab New Light, it's free, play that. If you want to invest in Shadowkeep, do. At that point, if you really feel you are missing older content at some point, pick up Forsaken. You can test the water without spending a thing.
---
We‚Äôve all been there
---
Cries in RNG
---
Beautiful
---
I do the same thing when Huntards camp heavy
---
What are the forges?
---
Personally, I have found Forsaken to be worth it, but if you want to wait and see how Shadowkeep compares you can do that too. If you don't play a lot you may not like Forsaken. People who don't have much play time say they find it "overwhelming." I think this is more of a psychological thing, since Forsaken isn't going anywhere and you have as much time as you want to play it. 
---
Note that due to D2 moving off of battle net, you won't be able to make any purchases on battle net starting Tuesday. If you have not decided to buy Forsaken (the Complete Collection is what you can buy there) by then, you will have to wait until Shadowkeep comes out and it moves to steam.

I do have paragraphs written about the golden age and the collapse before this page, but I wanted to share my timeline because it's the part I'm most proud of (it folds out!).  I am aware something like this may be better suited to subs like r/destinylore but as far as I could see I was unable to upload images there, and I really wanted to share my progress with others so far.
---
Of course he's not good he's still playing Destiny 2.
---
Ughhhhh, so frustrating to invade against
---
The nightmares are lesser bosses. One is the gate lord. Raid bosses saved for strikes very likely
---
Oh cool then. And just so I‚Äôm not mistaken the leveling system is getting overhauled correct? Everyone‚Äôs is gonna be fresh? I barley started getting back into the game like 2 weeks ago and saw the solstice event and some guy told me that would be the best armor and that i needed to grind it to be max level. And i do play every day so i feel like i can get some enjoyment out of it.
---
Sigh. Dmg-04 already confirmed its the raid armour man. And thats not how game design works. All assets would be done by now they would just be fine tuning mechanics/encounters/etc thats why they delayed it. Probably working on the raid too in a similar regard
---
Bag him after each time i wreck em.
---
Except dmg-04 confirmed it
---
What proof do you have of that?
---
From [the FAQ:](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/by457o/faq_shadowkeep_cross_save_free_to_play_and_more/)
---
&gt;&gt;I have Destiny 2 on Battlenet now. Am I going to lose all my progress or have to rebuy expansions when the game transfers to Steam?
---
&gt;No, and no. This will be a gradual process, as stated in the above Bungie page about Platform transfer, but you will, of course, keep all of your progress and absolutely not have to rebuy anything that you already own.
---
Worth is subjective. It is based on how much you play and what activities you, personally, like.
---
Where?
---
Yes, all players will be made power level 750, no matter what point they are at in the game. Source is on the Bungie News page of the official website, in the post titled "director's cut part II."
---
Well, if you‚Äôre on PC or XB1 you‚Äôll get three new strikes 
---
How do you know who the bosses will be? Are you assuming Phogoth and Omnigal remastered will be the strikes? 
---
I doubt the Io encounter is outside in the part you probably enjoy least, I‚Äôm guessing that the beef, but the new area was inside the Vex structure akin to Vault of Glass architecture. 
---
None of this really mattered though as it probably won‚Äôt contain what you want, all new stuff for vendors. I get that. Not really my thing personally, but obviously they aren‚Äôt going to cater to just me. Perhaps the development time was more spent on armor 2.0 and the gear for Eris, Vex activity, and universal ornaments. Maybe the vendor reset was a lower priority?
---
im playing gambit 24/7
---
striker titans are a problem !? ? Hammerhead is also not a problem 
---
dunno what you talking  about dude

---
I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed. While I do like the way the Omega Mechanos armor looks, I thought the new Season of the Undying vex armor looked a lot cooler.
---
Indeed, a disappointment. But we should move on and learn, and so should Bungie.
