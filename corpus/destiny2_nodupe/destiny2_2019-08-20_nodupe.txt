Woke up in a cold sweat after seeing this
---
---
---
Know what you mean I was playing for like 2 hours and still haven't finished strike related stuff
---
You've still got time, it ends on the 27th.
---
(empty tank lost sector intensifies)
---
I am wondering how much they‚Äôre going to stick to the D1 design.
---
ü•∞
---
Counterbalance stock isn‚Äôt worth it because the recoil direction is already 100.
---
"Overpowered." You must not be very familiar with comic books. 
---

---
(Also I think the most we got to see Ikora do is Nova Bomb a ship and hold a door open for five seconds so I *especially* have no idea where your logic is coming from.)
---
Yh I know but I'm very busy atm so finding time to play is hard
---
Just because PvP is changing doesn‚Äôt mean pinnacle weapons are disappearing. Beside there‚Äôs more pinnacle weapons then the Crucible ones.
---
If you want more tangible proof they‚Äôre sticking around, The Mountaintop and Wendigo quests are being retuned to be easier with the Shadowkeep patch
---
I‚Äôd assume so! Not to be rude or judgemental, but do you think getting a hand tattoo will affect your chances of getting a job or anything? I really want a hand tattoo but i‚Äôm also scared of getting shunned by potential employers.
---
I don't understand are hunters bad? What's going on?

Forsaken is a separate expansion. You need to buy it
---
They paid $60 to complain about Titans in PvP
---
*Mr. Krabs voice* Money
---
"they look around the hub" Bold of you to assume they've even touched the game since the base campaign. They probably just watch Youtube videos on why it sucks and lurk Bungie's accounts for a chance to drag the game.
---
I'm currently a store manager working for a 3rd party retailer and they have no prejudice about tattoos,  as long as they are not offensive
---
He‚Äôs trying to swap to his pve loud out cause he was just playing the new and improved crucible and had to take a piss during the loading screen
---
So I have to buy the forsaken bundle even though I have the dlc‚Äôs
---
I would think there‚Äôs an option for just forsaken but you might
---
I have an Xbox one there is no separate expansion
---
Fat fingered something there, should have been just the word exotics.
---
I get mountaintop, that was horrible. But why wendigo
---
I feel the same about crashing into Xol.. it gets me killed but here I go yeeting again!
---
I just got a my first gaming pc, I got D2 on ps4 and forsaken recently and I've grinded my ass off to get to max light. So does New Light work with cross save or will I have to buy D2 to access my cross save option?
---
I mean in an earlier trailer the titan tripped coming out of their ship
---
Why not both? An OEM bottom tree striker with jotunn.
---
DANK!
---
I believe you will get the deluxe items if you choose to use that as your main account across platforms, however this is not 100% confirmed
---
I'm gonna shove my ark staff up ur ass
---
Nop
---
That‚Äôs cool. Hopefully employers in my area aren‚Äôt prejudiced about tattoos either haha
---
It letting you buy multiple of the same tribute? I would do that man. It‚Äôs a bug and Bungie doesn‚Äôt like people exploiting bugs. Case in point, people figured out how to glitch the first freebie tribute and grabbed it 50 times. Bungie patched it and now the masterwork isn‚Äôt active for them until they get 45 tributes the legit way
---
That's not true, nothing will be going away
---
That's 1 for us Guardians and 121,428,379 for the Cabal Thrashers
---
Don't do them all at once and do gambit prime, these matches are faster.
---
Probably Vex Invasion sites
---
You could say that, yes. Best to prepare in other ways apart from power
---
Lmao we both just posted the same thing
---
Ok thanks
---
You forgot rocket launcher
---
True
---
[removed]
---
You‚Äôre talking a lot yourself for being in ‚Äúkillable by normal guns‚Äù range
---
Sounds like they should sherpa your way to recluse at least
---
Hey sometimes I'm a sniper hunter with stompees
---
Brilliant question, genius. Why do you think...
---
Oh yeah forgot about him, definitely the best for tutorials
---
This clip would have been 100 times better if they pulled out them micro minis
---
I actually like him a little now.
---
Yeah, I just randomly found one of his videos which was 13 minutes long.
---
Upping the playback time to 1.25 gives him a normal human speech speed.
---
Which means that there is 9.75 minutes of "content" (excluding his repetitive script) in that video....
---
#Halt r/emojipolice! You have the right to remain silent
---
Is /u/fuckswithducks a destiny player?
---
shit u rite, but at least hunters can go \*hop\* \*hop\* super then u ded, same thing with blink now that I think about it. y'know what imma just leave this and call it a day r/warlocksriseup.
---
Got off my hunter and went to warlock, got was it hard not jumping in a little closed area.  Also I miss my throwing knives. But the rift is cool. Feel like a medic which is real nice tbh.
---
Better panic super
---
Yea and you guys had to steal blink from us to hunters just cant catch a break lol
---
Needs to be changed ASAP
---
I wanna see how it looks with thorn now...
---
y'know warlocks taught the hunters blink right? lmao, I think cayde just convinced everyone that they don't need blink cuz traction stompees.
---
Agree
---
Make golden gun terrifying
---
That you have autism and missed the obvious solution that would result from: 
---
"I don't want to see videos from this channel anymore.  I know let's search the internet.  
---
**searches internet** 'how to block youtube channel' 
---
"oh look lots of extensions to block channels."  
---
"nah forget that Ima call youtube direct and be *that* guy"
---
I never said I didn't like it..
---
Yes, I was thinking of those. I hate whining for advice, but I feel like I‚Äôm missing a good chunk of content, with no prospect of seeing it.
---
So warlocks are Indian givers huh? Lol it's cool I never could get the hang of blink anyway love my stompees with traction
---
Yes... but have you tried standing in a Well, having a titan Melting Point, and popping Nighthawk and just watching the boss's health shit its pants?
---
Dawnblade in even moderately skilled hands is waaay better than Fists. You at least have a chance to teamshot or tractor cannon the striker titan, Dawnblade can cross the map 3 times at mach speed or just sit back and rain spam down on your spawn. Also arcweb grenades are the best in the game, closely followed by handheld supernova and then healing grenades.
---
Don't act like warlocks aren't doing busted shit, it's just marginally harder to use busted shit.
---
They really want you to use HC, Auto rifles, and SMGs this season don‚Äôt they
---
So uh, I‚Äôm a warlock main. And I have to say, uh, that hunters can suck my bombs.
---
Nope, your good.
---
Website might have been messed up or something as I was viewing it on mobile, [here‚Äôs a link ](https://destinytracker.com/destiny/population)
---
saw this earlier today, its a repost
---
I believe they're getting rid of levels and will be basing everything on power.
---
That would have only been 2 or 3 points which wouldn't have been enough for us to win. We only won the game by about 4 points so those 2 or 3 points wouldn't have been worth it when you consider that it is more likely than not that we would not have captured B had I not gotten the progress that I did
---
in the background is bungie and on the right is datto in his natural habitat eating ice cream
---
We call him YEETUS DELETUS! WE NEVER QUESTION THE YEETS!
---
I am not sure this was answered correctly, you can use your xbox save as your bnet ‚Äòsave‚Äô, but you cannot play forsaken on Xbox unless you actually purchase it on Xbox. DLC and expansions are not transferable to different platforms, just the character accounts.
---
Loaded Q. Just put a shader on it.
---
Now we gotta deal with the aftermath and all the hunters who are gonna solo blade barrage....smh
---
#FROM DOWNTOWN!!!
---
Cool, and I‚Äôm assuming you don‚Äôt get Eris Morn stuff until it comes out?
---
That Cabal is a Guardian through and through.
---
There's also a hive ritual place in Mars. Or I think it is.
---
I hope there will be other artifacts with other mods
---
The last column is all about class items mods... so i hope to have not to wait 3 season to get all the mods
---
"You tell me why you look like you headbutted a belt sander, and i'll let all of you go right now!"
---
Cringe
---
Nobody
---
Me: pulls out my arc staff
---
i use it for the EaZ when its a void day :)
---
I will check it out now I figured the game was just bugged. Before i needed this quest step I saw the pe every other event.
---
Going from Titan on beta or whatever it was to Warlock on launch, to Hunter...I actually enjoyed Hunter most. Warlock was lit tho too.
---
Wait, you guys are only paying 60 bucks?
---
Way I see it since I use to play mnk is like this.
---
Yes shooting is easier with mnk and destiny 2 recoil is almost nonexistent.
---
Pc has has better sensitivity settings. Able to do backward slides and faster movement.
---
But at the same time everyone on pc is able to do that so it becomes harder in general.
---
This isn‚Äôt so much a console vs pc thing it‚Äôs a bungie lack of caring thing.
---
Console has more recoil and bloom than mnk but it has aim assist. At the same time controller wouldn‚Äôt need so much aim assist or any of those issues were fixed. Personal opinion will vary.
---
Console only has a general sensitivity from 1-10. Traction is mostly mandatory among pvp players.
---
Again that‚Äôs just bungie lacking.
---
So summary is pc seems easier because it‚Äôs recoil/ shooting is better and better sensitivity options but is harder with a bigger skill gap because of movement. More guns are viable on pc as well.
---
Console seems harder because recoil and crappy sensitivity options but it has way to much aim assist so that makes it easier. The meta is precision frame handcannons because no recoil and bloom.
---
Both are equally easy and hard, completely different sandboxes within the same game isn‚Äôt a good thing it only leads to arguments and hate towards opposing platforms.
---
Xb1 ? I'll help you tomorrow if you're on. Need a nap. You'll get there don't stress
---
It took me a run where I wasn't getting any drops to finally get mine
---
Ah, another man of culture, I see.
---
I got one that makes me a real asshole
---
Back in dark below I was doing the omnigul nightfall with a group from LFG and being the dumbass 14 yr old I was, I started before making sure my mom didn‚Äôt need me for anything. Ended up having to leave like 3 times during that strike and I asked the dudes I was with to please let me stay in the group and they very generously did (though they sounded pretty pissed the third time).  I somehow ended up dying in the final boss room in a tricky spot (couldn‚Äôt be revived) and being very little help to them in general. They probably shot at her for another 15 min before finally killing her and whaddya know, I‚Äôm the one who gets a gjally.
---
From that day on I vowed never to be ‚Äúthat guy‚Äù again.
---
yo i feel you dude! i actually made an expanding brain meme on it, i actually main it

---
Good. Will help reign in the inevitable nerf fest that would've happened.
---
unless youre a flick shooter like myself who uses high dpi.
---
in which case golden gun doesnt really have enough forgiveness for me to really use the super to its full potential.
---
There have been eververse sales in the past, but only on silver purchases. 
---
I highly doubt that bungo will reduce the bright dust cost, because solstice is probably a last ditch effort to suck up people‚Äôs bright dust before Shadowkeep.
---
If you're on Xbox, the built-in LFG tool on the parties tab.
---
Hit level 20
---
I‚Äôm level 30.
---
I‚Äôm level 30
---
Maybe you have to be level 20? I know you can't pick up engrams from shaxxs until then. If it's not a level issue then maybe try hard resetting your xbox and see if that fixes it.  Good luck!
---
Till next year
---
I‚Äôm level 30. I was clicking to get the engram and it just did that and hasn‚Äôt moved.
---
I believe tribute hall aka weapons test area and is permanent, the triumphs are time limited

Jotunn
---
my exact point
---
No Raids are required for Solstice and no average player can solo raids, especially with no raid experience.
---
You're just jealous of our [A C R O B A T I C S](https://youtu.be/yQpKhpvTszQ)
---
I wish I had more answers for you. I have no idea. Try leaving and coming back? I hope you get it worked out.
---
GET YEETED
---
You sent all the messages? That‚Äôs why they all appear on the same side of the screen.
---
So when does my progress reset on getting the recluse? Is it still worth it now to try and get it?
---
It's a typo dude. It's just arc super kills.
---
Source: I asked reddit and did it myself.
---
Today is day three of being back since the second exp. just got my Solstice armor.
---
Good luck. Many grinds await thee

You can only fire it once. It takes a match to reload

AWAKEN MY MASTERS

Reckoning

titan and warlock mains- i hate challenges
---
Got a story. 2 weeks ago, me and my friend wanted to do a raid, but we didn't have any good fireteam, until some friends of his got online and decided to help us through the SOTP raid. Anyway, we finally managed to finish the raid after an hour or so and get to the loot room... and, well... (I did this raid 2 times in my lifetime) me and my friend ( the one that I was talking about) got the Anarchy! What made me laugh the most is that one of the guys was doing this raid for a very, very, very long time and NEVER got the Anarchy... well he left when he knew that we had it and I never saw him again... online, I mean..
---
TLIDR: Flex on dem haters, cuz I got what I wanted
---
Excuse me, our blade barrage is way better than the other 2 classes' blade barrage.
---
Why is this guy getting awards for someone else‚Äôs tweets?
---
Rick kackis over here talking shit for someone in arc striding distance.
---
I will preorder just for this, I have every exotic power weapon in the game and I still love two tailed
---
Fun for everyone who's not on the receiving end of a shouldr charge.
---
Nothing like the old school halo grenade jump double bounce. It's a pita to time just right, but we wall hacked a bunch of stuff with that methed. You could use a rocket launcher too when you inevitably ran out of grenades, but it was way more deadly.
---
Yea if bungo gives us blink back we'll how much shit kackis has to say then.
---
I bet Kackis uses One-Eyed Mask in PvE.
---
Say that to my really shitty "invisibility", fire boi.
---
Huh could‚Äôve sworn I read it was more like games with gold, you get it when your subbed and then you have it forever. 
---
Oh well not as good a proposition as I thought.
---
I‚Äôve only just done my warlock, I can‚Äôt do the last two, too much pain
---
r/fireteams or destiny companion app
---
I just figured I add everyone through pan I don't have the apps
---
It's the rare gloves from the solstice event, with the arc armour glow
---
Nice
---
roses be red, crucible is pain, you shot his eyeballs, he gonna scatter ur brains
---
Welcome to the club :)
---
Kackis out here spitting fire. Lol
---
You were there... Dark times.
---
Are effing kidding me rn.... I farmed 120 arc guardians kills for the last week.. Pliz kill me
---
Can my no mains play every character stand up
---
Well does not buff ability/super damage
---
The cheapest way to get all dlc is buying the complete collection edition that‚Äôs only like 35 usd.
---
Ah so that‚Äôs what the trick is. It took an guardian to teach me literacy
---
Read the rules, no witch hunting
---
You‚Äôre only at 600 points, not sure who you expected to team with solo queueing that low
---
A 1.0 isn't going to get you to high level comp. Don't bash people got trying to cry better
---
You barely broke even yourself, so if you had one more death would you shame yourself? No you‚Äôd let it go cause then you wouldn‚Äôt have a difference between you and them.
---
bet you were a warlock just throwing handheld supernova. 
---
Cause you weren‚Äôt a Titan or hunter.
---
What was your loadout in this game?
---
If you‚Äôre dodging GG shots, the hunter probably isn‚Äôt that good, it‚Äôs probably a Titan main trying to level up their hunter.
---
So 750 will be the standard? Even if you didn‚Äôt do the campaign?
---
Yeah I saw a lot of people like this guy saying *Is destiny even relevant, This game sucks, BOOOoooo* etc. And yes I read this off the gamescon Chat, I guess some people just be living under rocks nowadays
---
Unless you commit to strum and drang throughout the whole raid
---
pffff...
---
Well atleast I didn‚Äôt pick a Titan.
---
Technically, you didn't even go Positive yourself... Efficiency is KAD.
---
On behalf of all max range blast furnace mains, I apologise.
---
What if it was the shotgun version of isanagi‚Äôs burden where it shoots from all 9 barrels for an insane burst damage, but it cannot be reloaded with a dodge/Luna+rift/barricade
---
A week left? I just got my renewed. So I may be able to get everything if I grind for it.
---
So your glory rank will reset come shadowkeep and yes it is a beast of a gun!
---
The Titan shield has huge utility practically everywhere, if you‚Äôre gonna die you throw it down real quick and boy you‚Äôve got the advantage, same with Warlock, throw that rift on the edge of a corner and you‚Äôre pretty much invincible in a 1v1 unless you get sniped.
---
Depends if you want to play them or not. 
---
You can just buy shadowkeep that releases in October and that will get you access to the latest content but you will be missing all of the year two stuff. 
---
Alternatively you can just buy forsaken (and possibly the annual pass) as that will give you warmind and curse of Osiris (the year one dlc) free of charge.
---
Fuckin love that
---
I'm a hunter and that's not very Titan... Dropkick, maybe? Or even jump stomp?
---
Also, would love to see a Warlock one where they raise and slam an enemy into the ground with force push (or visa versa.)
---
Haven't played since D1. Sounds like this game is getting worse and worse. And to think I was going to come back. Left gaming because my son was born and don't have any free time atm.
---
The power weapon slot makes me üò¢
---
It also does feel like a ahy guy mask.
---
TITAN PUNCH!
---
Wait till iron banner in 2 weeks because on 9/3 it will be double valor and on 9/6 it will be triple until 9/10
---
Keep up win streaks, use double/triple valor times (usually during Iron Banana), play Rumble if you can finish top tree consistently , play with friends, competitive losses will not reset  your valor win streak.
---
Lol
---
But you look like every Hunter in the game.
---
1 worst match making possible get a team all higher skill level than your team solos matching 4 stacks glory grind is so rng and the number of payed carries means that solo players get stomped i enjoy 4 v 4 but i can get a better kd in quickplay which is supper sweaty
---
&gt;Extended Barrel
---
&gt;Extended Mag
---
&gt;Explosive Payload
---
YEET
---
Is that Hunter ok?
---
Back in D1 when u thought u could play some mayhem rumble and win but then a fire team joins the game and team on u
---
I see nothing but handcannons on xbox... try again nerd
---
If they had one, just one, cloak like the cloak of taniks....I would agree.
---
wait, so if fox bad because it's bad, or because it's superseeded by Truth?
---
That's great to see- I'm sure both of the Stadia players will enjoy it all on launch üëå
---
This! I did this while doing patrols on Io. Got real good at the double shot.
---
I cant believe you made me read the phrase "wrecked carcass" with my own three eyes
---
Its a full month event, that was achievable in a week of regular playtime (2h a night + a few extra hours on the weekend).
---
 It feels like much longer due to the Gambit requirement, but its been pretty straightforward. Some people were getting the sparrow on day 2-3 (even if you no life it, thats still not many hours at all)
---
Go for the Shadow of Earth shell. It's pretty cool.
---
Where is that
---
The slightest of slivers
---
[Nervous laughter]
---
I believe its spawn
---
Joke's on you, I payed just for forsaken
---
when is the weekly reset? I'm not familiar with destiny but I do have an account to transfer
---
Right, we jump away but It‚Äôs ok for Titans to hide be hide walls and Warlocks to heal in rifts. All we can do is dodge
---
‚ÄúWhy are you booing me I‚Äôm right‚Äù
---
Boing phoo-phoop
---
Okay that‚Äôs it everyone spec Blade his ass
---
Bs you don‚Äôt have to aim with that thing you point it in there general direction
---
I finished Gahlran Ofc last night with some friends and it dropped me only a Celestial... after single GGing him... thanks RNGesus
---
Along with everyone else who values their time and sanity
---
No
---
So where can I buy forsaken
---
Go to the store and buy the complete collection. It‚Äôs pretty cheap and has foresaken and annual pass
---
why care what people with shit opinions think.. its makes you just as dumb as them to indulge in it.. it takes a few words to deem whether someone has a shit input, opinion, or perspective on something thats naive and ignorant. listen to those few words deem them clueless or not then let them be to bask in their own shit perception and opinion..
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
and yes there is such thing as a shit opinion all because you have one doesnt mean its educated and doesnt have some underlying malice or bias towards something..
---
I mean I didn‚Äôt have to pay I got it for free
---
I just don‚Äôt understand why they gave the subclass whose whole shtick is precision and aiming an auto aim AoE super where you just press a button and everything on screen dies
---
Anyway, here's wonderwall
---
My understanding is that for the moment forsaken and the current season dlcs are remaining a separate element. Bungie has advised you do not need them to play Shadowkeep. The deluxe is for Shadowkeep and future seasons of content (The next 4 if I remember correctly)
---
JESUS CHRIST THE BANE OF THE CRUCIBLE NO I DONT WANNA REMEMBER
---
Omae wa mou shindeiru
---
Honestly, just play 2-3 matches at a time, step away from gambit for s but, and then go back so you don‚Äôt burn yourself out.
---
I gotchu
---
Do... do they have cloaks...?
---
German shaxx
---
Because hunter master race needed something to make them even better.
---
What is this helmet I keep seeing these memes
---
Thanks!
---
I was thinking the same thing. Seems pretty sus.
---
Whenever I invade the entire other team pulls out their snipers and start hunting me
---
Doesn‚Äôt look anything like it wtf headass
---
Damn only if I had that luck with getting lunafactions
---
I was joking with the second part, but not the first. Wether you main hunter or not, there is no excuse for missing multiple GG shots, they‚Äôre hitscan with 100% accuracy in air and on ground. Even if you have all this mobility, (literally just a should charge which is rather easy to hit, may miss one bullet I guess) there is no way two players of equal skill, one hunter and one Titan both in their supers, there is almost no way the striker wins if we don‚Äôt account super time.
---
This is a rather frequent occurrence.
---
Yeah, this. I think the added problem is there is *far* more diversity with solar and void weapons than arc. There are very few weapon choices for arc that aren't shotguns. I'm extremely bad at using shotguns in pvp, so basically my only option is to either suffer through a shotgun, use riskrunner, or in my case use an Osiris pulse rifle.
---
It's brutal.
---
"You never saw me coming."
---
Definitely strange. I frame by framed it and it would have to be exact timing if it was an item management transfer. But there are enough things going on to justify it- the dude leveled up, finished a game, and completed a daily challenge all at the same time with no overflow items. Possible, but incredibly unlikely
---
Yeah I did my Titan last cause I don't really play Titan in general haha. I think their armor is meh compared to the other two. That's just me though.
---
Fuck you lol
---
And that's how I got my gjallarhorn in D1. After a particularly bad match in crucible. I still wonder how salty everyone else in that lobby was
---
That day the guardian was amazed to discover when the Phalanx was saying "Rgrrr!" what he meant was "I love you"
---
This was fun with 6 people...
---
I remember a point in time where being a troll was almost ‚Äúcool‚Äù or ‚Äúfunny‚Äù but now it‚Äôs just cringey attention seekers at this point.
---
Now neither can I.  Thanx.
---
Absolutely. I used Black Scorpion and Uriel‚Äôs Gift. I wanted to die irl lol
---
Playing off meta weapons feels good and fresh. Sidearms are probably my favorite primary ammo weapon, aside from Sweet Business and Sturm.
---
Keep trying every tuesday

had to slow mo that to see the wall of fire coming out from that shield

&gt; If people want to keep pretending that Activision is the reason that destiny has so many faults then they're being willfully ignorant.
---
Activision had a different agenda in which it was prioritizing the integrity of COD releases over the rollout of D2 content. Then when it came time for Bungie to get publishing approval - Activision says no because it won't make them enough money, not enough killstreaks, whatever the reason is. Bungie was practically forced to offer players alternate satisfactory solutions to planned D1/2 content releases when they already had the potential to set a high bar (Halo 3). Activision practically failed Bungie.

Hi, yeah that's me. you're probably wondering how I ended up in this situation. Well it all started, in the summer of 82.....

Brah I can still have an opinion on a game I once loved. I bought this game when it first came out on Xbox 360, was one of the first to go to the light house. When I got a PS4 I bought it again and did everything, again. The first one was great and the second still has good gunplay. I'm just disappointed I'm the direction they took the second one in. Me being a trump supporter is irrelevant, go be stupid somewhere else
---
Yea even though the Hive are set up a main enemy this expansion I think the focus will more on the nightmares and hopefully a lot more enemy types then just the Hive and Vex, kind of hopping for a Taken King like expansion where everywhere gets something new to do and what not.

You don't need forsaken for shadow keep. You should only get forsaken if you want the content of it. Gambit and the 2 patrol areas are going free with shadow keep.
---
You decide if you want it.
---
Literally.
---
My friend yesterday was like "when he says apex is boring but goes to play destiny" like bruh there's so much more in destiny than a dumb battle royale

The problem is that very few people are guides while lots of people are seeking. It was a bad system on creation

It really does!

What you did today was just signing up. You are still on bnet. Your characters are linked. Youre good.
---
It's Beta I believe. Most people just use the companion app or 3rd party LFG platforms.
---
Xbox has a built-in LFG tool that works very well and every player I know uses only that for all games so there's no reason to mess with the Guided Games feature.
---
I mean great idea but ya like you said no ones guiding its just seeking! Lol
---
I used Jotunn, Blast Furnace/Service Revolver (depending on the map) and Hammerhead. Took me two weeks and I'm not a good PVP player at all (KD 1.1). Your best bet is to simply  party up and communicate.
---
Yea, that's when I got my Militia's.
---
Top tree tether is the hunter buff, grenades last twice as long and something else i completely forget. It was in the armour 2.0 stream.
---
Right I know that. My worry was that moving my bnet characters to steam would disable me from moving my ps4 characters to steam.
---
Nice. Super glad to hear that man. Good luck with your grind
---
lost a 4v3, and broke my controller because it was 5-0, and they literally came back and won. a reverse sweep is what it takes for me to lose all control especially since my teammates had supers for every round and never used them. feelsgoodman.jpeg

Imo with how the story is panning out right now we have a very high chance for a darkness subclass sometime in the future (not in Shadowkeep though probably, at least not right away). The whole "our lore is super naive, light is good and cookies, and darkness is baaaad....... but hey, under this surface&gt;! lightbearer iron lords slaughtered a ton of innocents during the dark age during their struggles for power, and Dredgen tried (and his followers still do) to use darkness without being corrupted, with the notion that both light and darkness are merely instruments, and its how you use them that makes them good or evil.....!&lt; " implies that we will get a darkness subclass sooner or later.

No solar week I guess :/

No, Moments of Triumph got extended to 9/17. SoH is still until the 27th.
---
Yeah the -8 or more downvotes on this post/all of your comments really show that I'm the problem eh

It's never too late for some VEX-NAM FLASHBACKS.

No its all linked up youre good

You will cross save your characters to battle.net and then from battle.net to steam
---
Reminds me more of Hotsuma. But then again I‚Äôm probably the only person here who knows who that is..
---
If you run tether with rigs..  I'll run well with lunafication next week. Let me know! Have some really good rolls but still dont have rapid hit w/ swashbuckler.
---
Thanks for your correction. This is what I meant. How do I do that line through the words?
---
 Hey thanks for the help. I linked my steam account on my bungie account. Is that all I needed to do to be able to move my characters over? I just don‚Äôt want to mess anything up or wait to long and not be able to use my characters from PSN.
---
This is great, thanks!
---
Thanks all!
---
You put two of these (~~) on either side of the word, so it‚Äôd be (~~)word you want to cross out(~~) without the parenthesis
---
I see what you mean, but I still don't think I'll use it.
---
Ah, so this is how PvEvP is gonna look like in D3.
---
This is the gym teacher I strive to be one day
---
Dude, this is Badass! I might have to give it a try!
---
So you think this is edgy and cool but it really means you have 0% chance of getting laid.  Nice one dude
---
Thanks homie.
---
I totally can do that! Add me whenever you want man, I am at work (9:30-6:30) all weekdays but still game all night.
---
Can't help but think that the class symbols kinda look like a wang.
---
Hey thanks! I joined a very op campaign (fighting adult dragons at lvl 4 and such) and the DM said we could make whatever we want, super heroes, whatever. So I made a guardian! I plan on making the Titan and Warlock variants at some point as well.
---
Oh ok i thought that was a special effect
---
Gambit prime matches are usually quicker than regular gambit. Most planetary bounties are short. That‚Äôs really all the advice I can give you, they don‚Äôt call it a grind for nothing.

Here's a link to a Google doc if you want to print it out
---
Couldn‚Äôt relate more! Although, definitely work on your tracking more
---
Just saying, it would go pretty well when I'm running the chaperone and trust.
---
You played Destiny 2 in February 2017?
---
Same. I played only 5 hours on [Battle.net](https://Battle.net), and I was expecting to make my PSN account my main save.
---
I literally only play Warlock and I've gotten so good with the jump, making myself able to move faster than most, but man, if the slow decline after you miss a ledge isn't heartbreaking, I don't know what is.
---
Wait a minute, I'll be able to Eater of Worlds and Spire of Stars raids and explore Dreaming City and Tangled Shore but I'll need to buy Forsaken? What does it mean? I'm kinda lost over here
---
Yep. Bungo made a bungo and ruined the weapon economy about a year ago.
---
Cross save happens tomorrow (8/21). That is where you choose the main account.
---
I'm not a PC player or hardware guy so I can't tell you much about the FPS drop, but I feel like it shouldn't be your strict NAT. It seems like NAT would just affect your matchmaking and connection with other players, and if it was affecting your connection to the game I would assume it would be more frequent. Though, it shouldn't hurt to try to fix your NAT to "open". There's a ton of guides online for changing your NAT type.
---
If you don't get an answer from someone on this sub, you might consider checking out r/DestinyTechSupport as well.
---
Hope you get it worked out!
---
I think you should wait for new light release...buy the game now is quite a waste...
---
Homie
---
Do the show him in any video?
---
The first 2 DLCs are free now, and the entire game is gonna go free as something called ‚ÄòNew light‚Äô at the start of October.
---
There‚Äôs a lot to cover, so the FAQ would be the best place to look.
---
I hate the titans running punch ability thing
---
The base game really doesn't have that much in it, curse and warmind along with the base game will be free when shadowkeep releases so I'd just wait until then if I was you
---
I'm looking at that "Fourth times the charm" Because ive never seen that, must be a new trait?
---
I feel your pain more than you could ever know.
---
That‚Äôs what you get for not making it heroic.
---
i have the same problem :/ do you resolve that.
---
My thoughts and experience exactly destiny 2 felt like a reboot not a sequel and was missing that bungie magic/ soul/ charm/ heart whatever you wanna call it that destiny 1 even in its most flawed states had not saying it was ever perfect but it had something special that kept me playing and had me seeking fireteams and making friends with an open narrative that felt like it was shaped around the world as opposed to destiny 2 where its world was shaped around the red war narrative which was awesome for like the first 2 weeks but then I realized how pointless these worlds felt after the fact. Not to mention the fact that the raid was pointless when basic drop legendaries with fixed rolls were just as good if not better than most the endgame loot. There was also that awful period of armor indentity crisis d2 had for the first year which had me hating my guardians. I will say forsaken was and is amazing, I kinda wish cayde dying was kept from the marketing to make it hit even harder but eh. Took a break after forsaken and came back on the tail end of the drifter dlc and have been enjoying it since and it feels alot more like a sequel now even if it took 2 years
---
oh that makes things so much better. thank you!
---
And now that we have greeted, prepare to be yeeted
---
Ok thx
---
oh, thanks. thought he just reappears every week on a diff spot
---
Just wait until you want the Mountaintop
---
As a titan: this is my dream
---
Source?
---
Bungie.net
---
Can you link the article?
---
Even dregs are tired of the titans
---
Again, it can happen. It just wont, because bungie doesn't care not because it is impossible, not because of anything OTHER than bungie just not wanting to do it. I have a ps4 pro, it can handle 60fps. Shut the hell up with your fake statistics. Not all games are optimized, it isn't my playstation it's the game. Fix the game, fix the problem. But that requires effort.
---
I main a different class each season. You should try it, there‚Äôs a lot of fun to be had when you spend a lot of time on the different classes
---
I don't think they'll close out the Tribute Hall/Bad Juju once Shadowkeep arrives, so you should have time. (But Bungie can be a little zany, so I could be wrong.)  I was usually running with plenty of Glimmer, so I bought several statues to get me started.  You'll eventually have to do some activities for the Triumphs to net the catalyst anyway, so it's not a bad idea to earn money and shards through the usual routes to defray the overall costs.  Good luck!
---
A fucking animal
---
Bungie really went the extra mile with the editing as well
---
He forgot to yell ‚ÄúFore!‚Äù
---
Thanks man! Do you have the Catalyst? Does it require completing every triumph? Besides the badge and the triumphs one, I'm most concerned about the Last Wish, and the Crucible/Gambit matches lol
---
Fortnite.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Welp I still think it's stupid to do that, but at least you only need to farm for the armor and not the roll which is a lot better imo.
---
Cool thanks. I wasn‚Äôt playing during the last solstice so I wasn‚Äôt sure how it worked.
---
Okay so I own PC Destiny 2, and my account isn't as far as my Xbox account, so you're saying that I need to transfer my account over to Steam right now, and then tomorrow I'll be able to choose my xbox account to be the one that is accessible through Steam? I pre-ordered Shadowkeep on Xbox already because it said that all of my purchases and DLC's come with the account when I transfer it. Is that not the case? Sorry, I'm pretty sure that's what you said but I'm not sure if I have a clear understanding
---
He really chested that poor dude
---
I second this
---
FOV increases performance.
---
Therefore a PS4 pro would have an advantage over a PS4.
---
It‚Äôs not fake, it‚Äôs the truth. Destiny sits at 30 FPS because it can‚Äôt do 60. Console can‚Äôt handle it.
---
Bungie even said that themselves when they explained their reasoning for 30 FPS.
---
Increasing the amount of stuff that‚Äôs gotta be rendered will affect FPS. If you can‚Äôt accept that then that‚Äôs too bad, I‚Äôll be wasting no more time.
---
Looking at the thumbnail, I thought it was photoshopped face. Nope. This is why exos are the masterrace.
---
&gt;my girl 
---
Weird flex but ok
---
In short, Yes. 
---
Everything you previously purchased on PC will still be available on steam. However, if you want to play Shadowkeep content on your pc, you will need to purchase it again for the pc.  It's dumb, but it's not bungie's fault. Its an entirely different platform. Essentially, you are paying for another license to use on a different platform. FFXIV is the same way.
---
Suprised he tweeted that instead of making a 10 minute video about that.
---
right. From the lore of felwinter's guile, it is clear that EXOs lose personal memories, such as their history, etc. But they do retain one thing: The memory of the process. Immediately after felwinter realize his memory is gone, he immediately asked: " I always remember my name. Something's wrong. Was I damaged in Crypt processing?"   
---
Every piece of information relating to guardian EXOs just can't agree with themselves.
---
She calls me her guy. It‚Äôs like Honey or babe it‚Äôs not really possessive. 
---
Weird focus but ok
---
goat
---
More like PvPwEW (PvP with enemies watching)
---
I had this in D1, never saw what the fuss was about, same with Bad juju, just seemed too niche, and well...they weren't a Gjallarhorn I guess.
---
But he said ding three times
---
Doesn't it start on the first?
---
I've been wanting a reworked west of sunfall 7. Sooo hyped for this season.
---
Shadow keep is released on the 1st but they decided to start the season on the 5th I‚Äôm pretty sure
---
Thought only the raid dropped on the 5th
---
Upvote with envy
---
Maybe the season is the raid and extra things. Not too sure though
---
I hope it's fully unlocked if we masterwork it now
---
That‚Äôs super cool haha
---
That's why all titans is cancer
---
One per day 
---
Drop rates increase 9/3
---
Like most of my game, I get 11 defeats and a 0.8 kda while someone on the other team has 44 and a 22 kda. Apparently I exist to get farmed. Quickplay sucks thanks to the lack of skill matchmaking.
---
Sounds like a 90s kid that grew up on chicken run. He eres my upvote
---
You me both just wondering shall I masterworked my crucible reset I didn‚Äôt bother feeling like doing it as I was going to be losing the set but we see
---
Yeah I just got the solstice armor and I want to try to level it up in time. I realize it'll be hard but I want to try to make it happen. Never played crucible or gambit as I turn lvl 50 just this week.
---
He was in the first trailer/preview they released
---
I ask this as a warlock, can titans actually read, ever?
---
EX-TER-MI-NATE!
---
Probably not how it will work. The new armor will be a separate set from what you are currently wearing. It will probably all be either a set drop level 4-6, or drop randomly like every other armor in the game
---
I have played like 1400 hours of this game solo. I've needed lfg for nightfalls and some of the harder exotic quest steps like corrupted etc, but plenty of others have solo'd them. Also no raids for me unfortunately
---
Yeah I was expecting that
---
Rude of you to assume the Warlocks economical status.
---
Yep, that‚Äôs Arc Web already
---
5700xt NON BLOWER VERSION. And 144fps and hertz
