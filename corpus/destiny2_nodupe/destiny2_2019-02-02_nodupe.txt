Was kind of under the impression that it might just be secret and nobody has discovered how to unlock it yet? Could be mistaken but figured Bungie would just be silent about it.
---
---
---
Like what? I suppose I could see it working if only people who have completed the raid at least once can enter matchmaking, but if people have completed the raid once they probably don't need matchmaking that badly. 
---

---
I think the problem of people going in completely unaware that there are mechanics besides "shoot bad guys," not knowing the whole light fading thing, not speaking the same language, etc. is far too high. These would be like every single day 1 raid but without the camaraderie. Each matchmade raid may well last upwards of 7 hours as everyone figures things out from scratch, alt tabs to watch guides, or leaves the team out of frustration. 
---
Wait are people actually saying it's a hard step? it's literally BEYOND easy
---
Thats the problem. It's not well implemented. Should exist a solo guide/tutorial and then a tier system for new - advanced players. In fact that's what people do in apps, the thing is an auto matchmaking system would make the job in minutes, while sometimes you need 2, 3 days even 1 week to find a group to play with.
---
Dregs for sure. 
---
Link to DTR stats?
---
The dlcs are pretty good, what your paying for is forsaken. It adds so much new content its 100% worth.
---
Could be a ghost projection or a gift of light, those don’t show up any wear 
---
I feel like it wouldn't get used much with all the other options out there. Xbox users have the built in LFG tool, and PC/PS4 players have the many LFG subreddits and Megathread and websites and apps to choose from. I've seen how many people post with our reading the FAQ or subreddit rules first, and I think they'd ignore a Megathread as well. 
---
I will copy my answer from the other comment:

Always buy what you dont have first 
---
It's one of the few squares you can select. When talking to him. 
---
Well there is Guided Games
---
No it’s a joke 
---
Exotic drops like that have happen since destiny 1. I would buy something from Xur and then like clockwork it would drop in the open world.
---
Hopefully you have better luck next time.
---
forgive my ignorance on hunters;
---
are you going invis after precision kills?
---
Fuck yeah. Especially if you’re a shoot and loot fan. I’ve been playing with my buddy consistently for a long time now and it was definitely worth it in my opinion.
---
Too many really bad players out there that want carried. Raids are teamwork based missions and no way I'm dealing with kids, attitudes, trash talk, shitty mics, etc. 
---
link to DTR stats?
---
Kill more
---
Get a few more.  It rounds up
---
I did it as a duo and have run it as a duo each time since to get the catalyst and the ship. It’s practice and having a solid loadout. Know the shortcuts as well! Look that shit up and it’ll save you so much time.
---
I’ll do a raid with you bro. #haveclears #riven cheese #dont suck #knowwhattodo. #experiencedplayersonly.

Welcome to online destiny 2
---
I did not see that. I modified something I saw on r/jokes

Trinity goul

That would be awesome

Even on PC. tlw is a fantastic gun, but I'm terrible at using it. I'd just rather use Ace.

Destiny Grimoire Anthology Volume I

I'm very concerned at worried that you haven't gotten a kill clip/rampage roll on a kindred orchid. Like that specific roll is only from powerful but you can get that on a random roll.
---
Isn’t it? I can’t wait for them to release more so I can start a proper collection!
---
honestly just imagine this but instead of shooting arc energy into a meatball i'm shoot hot jizz into minnie...
---
not my proudest fap
---
I didn’t think Antoine would take notice or mention it but that pun was totally intended! 
---
Found the PvP-only sweat.
---
yup then the ones who say they'll train magically forget
---
Zavala: How does this movie start? What’s the opening scene?
---
Shaxx: I say it begins with our Guardian seeking glory in the Crucible! What say you, Drifter?
---
Drifter: (Holds up coin) Fallen! On the horizon.
---
Okay.
---
I'm not sure how that works, I've used the app before to transfer gear, but whenever I try using it to join groups it shows me in the app that I've joined a fireteam, but nothing happens in game.
---
You just bought the DLCS, man. That's on you. Should've read the contents of what you're buying. It sucks though.
---
Copying:
---
First. You are not obligated to use matchmaking. You can keep doing your premading staff.
---
Second. Tier system, based on number of completions and steps/kills/collaboration staff done by the player during raids, and previous chat to let people be clear about what they are looking for, and their experience.
---
And a kick system with re-match included.
---
This is just an ideal mechanic thought. But here you have it.
---
Literally got it right before so I’m officially Dredgen as of this video! The scrub wheel on the video blocks the seal triumph 
---
Some tasks come back after four days.
---
Thank you friend
---
?
---
Nope, not to play forsaken or anything beyond. I would encourage you to play Warmind tho. It's super short but I thought it was pretty fun. 
---
Haven't had this situation specifically, but in general if I say I understand something but actually don't,  it's a combination of feeling ashamed at how slow I can be to learn (not disabled, just stupid) and feeling bad for having someone explain something so many times.
---
Yup, random drop, nothing new. Been around for a while
---
Woah, now that's a hand cannon
---
This all made me wanna shoot myself but atleast i can say i completed all of them 
---
I was gonna say GTA V: Doomsday reference
---
You can always pull it out of your collections
---
Make your own post
---
There never up at the same time thats what i have to wait ten min for
---
Based on how the Forges and *especially* Gambit goes, that would be absolutely abysmal to deal with.
---
I did it in Mayhem with my warlock. Lobbed homing nova bombs into open areas or long path ways. Then I hid and waited for it to recharge with the dire ahamkara skull. 
---
Holy fuck I just watched this movie today after I got done playing crucible wtf
---
HerOiC Is rANdOm
---
It's a struggle 
---
You had me at monster girl
---
Oof, sorry to hear that. I've never had someone rage quit but my clan leadership tries hard to keep things as casual as possible, the argument with the sherpa happened like 3 days after the raid when I vented on discord. 
---
As for shields, I've only ever done scourge once, but I thought it was pretty standard to have one player focus on dropping the shields by themselves with maybe a little help from people hanging around the map? Is that not how most people do that fight?
---
I expected DIO
---
Yeah he’s an Xbox fella
---
I find it funny, I will immediately use guides for content on destiny, but played Hollow Night and spent like 50 hours guide free to get through it.
---
They've already talked about it and don't like the idea.  You'll be matched with morons most of the time and have a terrible time
---
Not sure what class you're playing, but i got mine as blade dancer Hunter by just saving the super till someone invaded and used theirs. Took forever (maybe one every four or five games) and felt scummy, but that's what Dredgen is all about :p
---
What
---
BECAUSE SYMMETRY?
---
I did it in mayhem, but replace "pulse rifle" with "blindly firing homing nova bombs into pathways and open areas."
---
This is better than Civ V with the Brave New World expansion pack.
---
Why are you doing it in mayhem?
---
Exactly,I was so excited then all of a sudden a sparrow popped up
---
Yeah it was the norm when Jace Hall was a thing lol
---
What part about Wikipedia is unreliable?
---
I know mate, I'm in the same boat.
---
Hit 635 this week, was a struggle even when playing a lot, although I started maybe 2 weeks ago or so, playing in general.
---
But the method I posted was explained to me yesterday, and I think I'll be grinding up my alts this weekend through Mayhem, seems to be a great and efficient way to do so. 
---
Interesting find! I really hope it’s true because I miss that they gave us Niobe labs so easily
---
The one on Titan is way faster if you're doing them for the LW quest. I fast traveled after completion and ko'd all 3 in about 5 minutes.
---
That's awesome.
---
we had 2 warlocks and a hunter (well of radiance, Dawnblade and Tether (Nighthunter?))
---
we had the most problems at the last fight and in the elevator because there little to no safe spaces
---
we never used mods really and weren‘t to familiar with how the elements worked (we are not the most experienced guardians)
---
also we went with our favourite and highest lightlevel weapons(other weapons would have been smarter probably)
---
well iI will do it again either way when the next one of us 3 completes the first step of the quest xD
---
I have never once seen ANYONE using ace in crucible since the first week or two of its quest release 
---
Not onr person on ps4 in hundreds of games 
---
I rocked this part in Mayhem because of the 4 stacks. Cowardly chucking novabombs over walls did the pvp parts of the quest quickly. 
---
Destiny 1 Crucible was great actually ,supers killed you but they weren't the crazy op stuff we face today, Invective quest came when the worst you could face was a Vex Mythoclast and it wasn't common,Suros Regime was common and super manageable,Thorn = Do you have Atheons Epilogue? Yes, good here is your Thorn,First Curse and Chaperone were released in the special meta were it swapped between snipers and shotguns but also people  without dlc were separated from everybody so to get those steps cleared easily you went to "classic" crucible and faced people also doing the quest and people without meta/good guns/supers and "classic" rumble let you join with your friends to lend you their heads for a super easy quest , if you try to get the Last Word in Destiny 2 you have to worry about
---
\- Hunters and they just patched awesome buffs (no salt here ,go have fun)
---
\- OEM Titans 
---
\- Heavy Ammo appearing more quickly and other enemy grabbing it 
---
\- 6 Stacks of Not Forgotten and Random Luna's Howl 
---
which all together mean you have to camp super hard and advance slowly  or you die yes?
---
of course im talking about not so good at crucible players here good player already got it
---
i quit  the quest ,lets see if in a month im in the mood 
---
Cowardly chucking novabombs over walls did the pvp parts of the quest quickly. 
---
Vanguard: SVU
---
I wonder if it has something to do with the three guardians holding batteries at the same time and charging the plates or something
---
Precision kills while crouching 
---
i mean i get it when level 12's do it since they don't know shit yet but when a power 650 with izanagi's burden one shots the tank that's when they cross the line
---
Cool I'll check it out. We have Michael's here.
---
UNLIMITED POWER!!!
---
I am trash as well. It took me what, 6 games, and one of them I fucked around with triple snipers and lost like 10% progress because I was bored (I'm not a big Destiny pvp guy, shits boring and aggravating to me)
---
It's not hard, it can just be very time consuming if you arent good at pvp. As long as you can manage even a .51 you are making progress, it's not until an avg of 0.5 or less where you break even, making no progress. Yes that would take you 100 matches, yes that is a LOT of time, but no it is not impossible, hard, or worthy of a change. 
---
Ah good to know thanks
---
Yeah I guess it's endgame content for some reason. I'm not nearly level 50 yet. Thanks. 
---
What gun is that in primary slot?
---
Hate PVP. Managed to get TLW in about 8-9 hours. Oddly enough the crucible medals step took the longest for me. Haven't stepped foot in PVP since. Undoubtedly the Thorn quest will truly make me wanna destroy my PS4. 
---
Didn't xur have it last week?
---
Not sure. Just found him today for the first time 
---
Main thing I’ve found is that if you’re honest, teams won’t be as toxic - they’ll either remove you from fireteam right away, or at least try to take you through as much as is feasible. Also, watching a video on the raid mechanics and how it all works prior to going into a raid makes things easier for everyone and will make a fireteam more likely to keep patience if it’s clear all you need is experience and one or two attempts to get the feel rather than learning the mechanics as well as everything else going on!
---
How do I get the golden frames?
---
Sorry for all the questions but I'm dumb so
---
This isn’t an original joke

That's what I was doing...

Maybe he’s a hunter then. Could have sworn it was a Titan but I might be wrong

That’s dope

It’s all about those reflexes ;)
---
Compared to what? 
---
Titan gang
---
Joining a clan helped me out, and plenty of clans cater to introverts like us just trying to play with a fire team! Might be worth checking out
---
Yea i had it done pretty quick, still working on lunas though that shit is rough. 
---
Titan running Telesto, typical :D hope to see you out there T :)))
---
I’ve gotten sniped by those shields before. Once I was minding my own business running through a seemingly empty part of the map when I suddenly just got wasted by something void - death message shows I died to sentinel super. Looked around for what the heck happened and saw the outline of the Titan who decked me on the other side of the map. I don’t know if it was just weird timing and his shield was still flying when he got killed or something. It was so surprising though that I just had to laugh
---
agreed. Day 46, I'm heroic three. been doing this shit for 2 months

The T is for Telesto.

350+ games since meatball became available and have never seen it. Fuck this game.

I’ve been playing d2 for weeks now with a 2kd every game and my average is like 1.79 l. I’m just saying in that amount of time that’s a little sus just to get some medals and kills
---
The dude made a song called cop killer, he don’t give a fuck what you think about him using Telesto.

Plays 11 games up to 23% ended 2%, oh the shame 
---
Im so sorry... that is awful
---
&lt;3 &lt;3
---
Wanted my vampire robe to be more vampiric 👀
---
Haha he even complained about the ace of spades having a pvp requirement
---
And i also snipe, so we’re in the same boat
---
Sniping is all about getting the shot first, rushing to the sniper lane, know various lanes for the same spot and above all, movement and map control. Your opponent wants you to peek that same lane, he thinks you will and most of the time, the people that complain about flinch do peek that spot again and get out-gunned. 
---
Exactly. Also making sure everyone has a few hours of time commitment and know when to take a break. Sometimes the first clear will take multiple sessions to prevent tempers from rising haha
---
His is no longer Ice-T but Water-T after he was free from being turned to ice by his father to fight the Numbericons. 
---
Bungie forces pvp more and more in our faces, which isn't cool, I took half an hour to complete the pvp related stuff, but I don't like pvp and it annoys me a lot
---
Me_irl
---
Haha well you got lucky and got a great deal!! I preordered the d2 deluxe edition and paid $100 for the worst dlcs ever made. Lost complete hope in d2 and quit it after 2 months, got to max light did the end game and TRIED the raids but nope, not nearly as fun as the destiny one raids. All i did was kill calus like twice off a checkpoint. You could say at least the pvp was decent but nope, i was a big pvp guy in d1 but the new mechanics they implemented in getting the casual players more involved ended up being the last straw. I quit and only came back after the second month of forsaken. Its gotten a lot better but its not perfect. All we can hope is that now that bungie left activision, we actually get want the community wants, not ways to make money
---
This, so much this
---
that helps a lot, thanks!
---
Or watch the raid for dummies videos by KackisHD 
---
I'd go with Datto since I dont want to support Kackis but same idea yeah
---
I'm just trying to say to y'all Guardians, "This is what the taken feel revel in this" and "embrace the darkness" aren't really Guardian motos. As far as I'm concerned, any Guardian I see with the dregen title it's no longer a Guardian.
---
I literally finished the pvp portion in 2 games. Both 30+ defeats and a 2.5kd+. I understand that most players don't have games like this regularly or ever. But it really isn't a big deal that we have to do some pvp. 
---
They dont regularly force it in our faces. The only thing that ever felt forced was how much Gambit was shoved in our face when Forsaken came out. 
---
Would you rather we had to do another 15 lost sectors, or some other monotonous bs?
---
All you got left is team shooting then, assists work
---
I got it for free back in September after main story immediately bought forsaken then a month later bought the annual pass I'd say I'm having fun
---
I would like to have a PvE option for pvp steps, and pvp options for PvE steps, so everyone could do something they really enjoy 
---
I'm on Xbox, if anyone sees this and wants raid help. Not soloing any bosses but I can explain mechanics and I'm not an ass.
---
Shin Malphur hunts followers of Dredgen Yor; Dredgens, the title you get from the Gambit related seal. 
---
Fun title. Not too tricky. Would recommend. 
---
Meme is from the movie Hot Fuzz where the local village police department are about to attack the deli meat counter in the supermarket, Somerfield, while the butchers throw knives at them. 
---
Fun movie. Lots of gun fights. Would recommend. 
---
For a weapon that's of pvp legend? Yeah, no. That's like saying I want to get Anarchy from playing some crucible. Have to do the activity to get the thing, not pick and choose
---
Loadout only maters in pvp and its usually hc/ pr + shotgun. In pve its only on your taste as everything with good roll is usefull.
---
Hahahahahaha Shi..t man 
---
Thank you very much
---
Kind of exciting to think that graphics, at least for consoles, still have room to improve when most games looks so phenomenal on them right now! We could be talking about how we thought RDR2 had better graphics than it did one day.
---
You want to Tell me my Blast Furnace has the same perks as the curated but ist not masterworked?!
---
And how can I make event Heroic ?
---
If you're doing it just for the new weapons.. don't.
---
Thanks 
---
Ok that means two things, you have all exotics available for the class you were on and he only gives pre-forsaken exotics anyway.

Thanks I know the site, but was not there for a long time.

Oh I see something now, "Nessus Orbit - Leviathan. Destination"?

Thx
---
You have to play super carefully still, but try Nightstalker in Mayhem. I felt like a dirty rotten cheater with how much backstabbing and disappearing I did but found with Mayhem popping up the super so often, I could pick and choose my battles really easy and if it didn't look like there was a person I could pounce on... I just let the super run out as I got distance between me and all the red figures I saw through walls to let the super return. 
---
But for me, being able to see where everyone else was and knowing where to avoid and being tactical made a HUGE difference. Some maps suck for being stuck on the ground like that, other maps are brilliant for finding a nook to throw a few grenades from and let your super come back. I had originally tried mayhem with blade barrage and just...traded kills too often to make much progress at all. With Nightstalker, if I ended up accidentally getting more than I could handle, I often literally just kept hitting the ability to -escape- because nightstalkers swerve so much I could sometimes get out of range or back to my teammates without dying. And again, for me a HUGE part to managing the stress and playing smart was aided by popping the super and checking out where all my enemies were through walls. 
---
I did go back to blade barrage for the medals portion after that quest step because I didn't care if I traded kills there, I just needed to make them. :P
---
Well you type English pretty good sooooooooo......
---
Damn. Was just about to shoot him a friend request 
---
Youtube?
---
My man ice t making use of the telesto meta
---
What exotic armor do you have? That matters more in my opinion. A single piece of exotic armor can completely changed the efficacy of a given subclass. 
---
With Gunslinger, I usually go...
---
Young Ahamkaras Spine for top and middle tree.
---
 Ophidia Spathe is another great one for middle. I don't like the extra knives as much, prefer the tripmines. Just personal play style, I guess. Shards of Gallanor is amazing for middle, one of the best exotics in the game, really... but I don't have them, so just hearsay.
---
Celestial Nighthawk for bottom tree. It's super fun to one shot most things in the game, but when I miss, I get annoyed at myself, end up saving my super too long, not actually using it. It is highest DPS burst damage in the game.
---
Frost-EE5 are great for any Hunter, any class.
---
Anyway, those are my top picks for Gunslinger. Weapon selection doesn't really matter as much. Use what you like, what you feel shots you best.
---
That's cool and all..  but, let's talk about his wifes booty!  Damn  :)))
---
Terry luuuuuuuuvs viddy games!
---
My download speed's about 180 KB/s
---
Yeah ;-;
---
It's easier now alot of the hardcore pvp'ers have done it and moved on, patience helps, many seem to get very upset if they cannot complete content within hours of release, sit back and enjoy having something new to work towards, you'll get there
---
I run a Titan and cannot figure out how to defeat or not constantly die to blade barrage ever few seconds. It kills me in my super and I won't ever even get a mutual kill. 
---
There's usual 3, sometime more, people using it. 75 to 90 percent of my deaths m mayhem have to be from that one super. 
---
But you could get a good roll armour pice, that's why I go to him every week, despite having every pre forsaken exotic
---
I'm a former WoW player, I never have gotten that "mandatory DLC" thing people go on about here. You have to do the same thing in WoW... plus a monthly sub. I payed 40 bucks for Forsaken, and in however long it takes me to get up to it, maybe another 40~ish bucks for the annual pass.
---
Compared to 50 bucks per xpac + 15 a month I can't complain, really.
---
Is he playing on a CRT?
---
Free is the best value.
---
And yeah, as someone who loves the game (and managed to enjoy it even through vanilla/CoO) I've definitely gotten value outta my game + season pass.
---
Regrettably bought the annual pass on ps4 though, so will have to rebuy that alongside Forsaken when internet gets better. But I put enough time in to make it worth it.
---
Also because it was Caydes gun.  :)
---
Blade barrage is playing to the spirit of the Mayhem game mode. The Fun Police are people playing Tether.
---
I'm on ps4 until I can build my PC 
---
I believe with the american version they send you a gun in real life. Could be wrong but seems legit.
---
He read on Kotaku that it's better than civ 5 with the brave new world expansion pack

&gt;Yes it is.

I am litterray 2 hours into the PS+ version of D2 (vanilla I assume), and this is solid info.  
---
THANKS! :)
---
Yeah this. First character to 650 is hard, the next ones are super easy. On my last one I just transferred my 650 weapons to my warlock and grabbed armors from collections (they were all over 600), then just played pvp and gambit and strike dailies/weeklies + the raids to fill up the gear. I think it took me a couple days at the most. 
---
Do you really want to hear me say "son of a bitch!" all the time.

That's why I don't.

Well, I’m just trying to make friends that suck as bad as me
---
2 weeks
---
It's fine I used to be guilty of this too
---
Lol thank you for this post. I consider myself way above average in PvP and I finished that 2nd in almost one game. Pulling off a 3-4kd, got me to like 75% so it took two games but I was thinking how hard can it really be if you just sit back and play smart and passively. 
---
Dude yeah you have resistance but you’re literally one hp. Even with resistance you’re not gonna resist a titan super or let alone any super. Maybe you could resist bullets or a melee but not a super when you’re that weak. 
---
Thanks so is this message normal if I haven't done that?
---
"No results
---
We are unable to find that name. Please try again."
---
Why not? Pretty much all of the forge weapons are the best weapons in the game. Threat Level (curates) bears Ikkelos, Hammerhead is better than Thunderlord and Avalanche in PvP, Kindled Orchid is pretty much the only energy hand cannon people will use now, blast furnace is a better go figure. And the exotics are all pretty fun too 
---
OH man those perks physically causes me pain wow.
---
Yeah I keep meaning to look those up since Byf mentions his videos so often. Thanks again for the reminder!
---
Much obliged Guardian.

Oh that explains a lot, I usually just join the chat in game

The Dreaming City changes each week on a 3 week cycle, for everyone. Lore wise, this is because of the "last wish" Riven unleashed when the first raid team beat the Last Wish raid.

Quests in ESO were really good! I couldn't quite stand the combat, specifically mobs which would be just standing there as targets... 
---
I’ve always had an Xbox until recently. Now have both, just cause. Avid gamer I suppose. Not to mention gears (ice t character cameo) is an xbox exclusive...
---
No they definitely are but whoever I'm on gets the new one
---
They still haven’t for me yet, all I want is trinity ghoul
---
Shader is Calus’s treasured, the prestige leviathan shader. Helmet is nezarec’s sin with the ornament, chest is reverie dawn
---
Kinda agree, this is just standard stuff.
---
Heart... Actually the jumping puzzle from Shuro to Morgeth, we also went flawless so that was terrifying 
---
Go to the Cryptarch.
---
Sry
---
it has happened to me with a friend exactly once since the launch of Destiny 1, it was in D2 and he joined up with me and there was no loading screen he just joined the fireteam, that's why we knew it had happened 
---
One day I’ll be truly blessed lol
---
Nope, that is wrong, completely wrong. Lesbians stay lesbians, you guys just don't wanna admit yo all ghey for Shaxx 😄
---
Primeval slayer x10 is how.
---
She looks like she is high on crack
---
Remember, crucible and medallions 
---
Thanks for your help :)
---
My group failed at the Heart Run as they weren’t communicating well enough (slow down, I’m dying etc) but once you get that hit down it goes nice.
---
The jumping puzzle between Shuro and Morgeth is just practice, and once you’ve got your route, it’s a little less stressful, but still hell!
---
My God the jumping was terrifying, I agree with everything you said 
---
Unfortunately with the way this game is at times, you're going to have to get your feet wet with pvp sometimes. Even if it's just for challenges and the occasional exotic quest. I'm the same way. I definitely play for the pve, but it's just the nature of the beast.
---
The element, like people have already said is largely just for shield matching. An arc energy gun will break an arc shield very fast and add some aoe damage to help clear ads faster and it'll save you some time and ammo, but unless you're really struggling, it doesn't make too much of a difference. 
---
The other thing, since you're playing warlock, is some of the exotic armors have some perks that play well with certain damage types. Like the helmet Nezaracs Sin gains energy faster by dealing void damage and that carries over to void weapon damage. So having a nice void energy weapon will help your abilities and your super stay up more often, making your overall output feel much greater. 
---
So just pay attention to your perks and build something that synergizes with the way you like to play and you're golden!
---
Remember to reassess your perks as you get new gear and try weird combinations and you're golden!
---
Congrats. Thunderlord is amazing. 
---
I 100% of the time avoid this forge for this exact reason. Too many failed attempts from this unacceptable mechanic. 
---
Best of luck with RNG for that title now guardian!
---
He was also in my D1 clan of all ages.  Nice young man who does well in school.  I always tell the younger guys, “Do well in school so you can make money since your not having to work 3 jobs to get by. More gaming time”
---
True, but me and about 15 of my discord buddies got so burned by the release state of the game.
---
There was no way we were throwing down another 60+ dollars just to actually enjoy the game that we paid for.
---
None of my friends play the game as a result.
---
Best of luck with that that rivensbane title, guardian
---
Thanks! I just need the bow and to do the challenges and I'm done! 
---
thx4 the anxiety
---
If it helps, I’ve done 28 runs, about 8 of them I’ve just needed the bow.. RNGesus is the worst.
---
Destiny has lots of criticism but it has a huge player base and community. Im done complaining about anything anymore. According to Bungie they've heard us and they're listening lolol. I just want them to continue to evolve and not forget the loyal ones that remain who do enjoy it.
---
Also- ABUSE YOUR RIFT. 
---
If you're dying a lot, keep your healing rift up in cover and pick your encounters. Get lots of resilience perks to keep it around 7 or 8 if you can while maintaining your regen.
---
If you feel weak, keep your empowering rift up and make the best of your high-damage weapons. Get lots of grenade and super energy mods to keep those Nova bombs flying and your devour on cool down.
---
Thankfully RNGesus blessed me with 1k on my first clear... When I didn't have a mic
---
Laughs in ghorn
---
Aside from the exotic armor, nothing has a shader here. The color scheme is that of burnished dreams.
---
Yeah you have to wait till the servitor teleports away 
---
Titan gang 4 life

Why not fate cries foul? 
---
God I love the outskirts of the tangled shore
---
Ok thanks I didn’t know a pvp quest came out and I’ll be trying out faster hand cannons and if that stuff doesn’t help I’m people just bad 
---
Ok thanks 
---
alright I'll try that thanks for the idea
---
It took me more than 15 matches to get that quest step done. Even if you aren't very good, you will get there eventually! 
---
Okay, thanks for the information!👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
---
Oh my god, exactly this. On the Tangled Shore especially it's cancerous. We need those Ghost Fragments to get Enhancement Core bounties, damn it!
---
Aachen has the godroll and one of the best scopes in the game. And it always drops with that roll unlike fate cries foul.
---
Damn Jenny McCarthy spreading her anti-Shaxx lies
---
yes
---
Ok thanks I’m bad at pvp especially this one I don’t know what guns are good and even if I had the best stuff and best hand cannon I suck w them so it wouldn’t really matter
---
***clap clap clap***
---
I like how in this comment, the qualifying factor for “good” is that it has a monster girl
---
Well fuck you too then. 
---
This was reposted from /r/raidsecrets where it got removed, so enjoy it here!
---
It is if you let your imagination work 
---
What is this meme format? Am I supposed to somehow recognize a photo of a random person using sightseeing binoculars?
---
Heroic events in general entail doing something specific during the event, usually before the final stage of it. For Tangled Shore drop pod ones, you shoot out the air vents on the sides while the freezing gas is happening, and then lob the orbs from them at the boss.  
---
Googling a Heroic Events guide would let you browse through real quick to get a feel for what to do on the different ones. It's not generally too hard to get Heroic enabled on them.
---
Good Luck Guardian!!
---
🔆
---
Does it still do the damage of a 150 in PvE? Like can it 1-tap adds, because if so, nice
---
Thanks. I have forsaken but if you don't can you buy the annual pass? My friend hasn't bought forsaken yet
---
"Builds" are barely a thing in this game. So many things are viable, or *very* close to one another, that optimization doesn't really give you much. The youtuber Ehroar makes a lot of power weapon damage comparison videos, but as far as abilities and primary/secondary weapons go, I don't know of any good sources of information. 
---
ok thank you lol, i was worrying for a second 
---
Thanks alot for this explanation! Makes much sense now! I have always thought enemies might be more vulnurable to different kind of damage. For example Cabal takes more damage from X while Taken takes more damage from Y. 
---
Glad you explained how it works! I am using "Claws of Ar~" From Xur this weekend for an additional Melee charge. Works nice
---
You need Forsaken in order to do the Annual Pass stuff. 
---
Also, the only quests that ever disappear in this game are things from holiday events, so no matter how long you or your friend wait to buy the annual pass, it will always be there waiting. 
---
Thank you alot for all of this! it helps very much! I will look into your links to learn more.
---
was about to comment that, its annoying as fuck to wait though
---
I soloed it on heroic version with 2 min left, with arcstrider top tree, raiden flux, hammerhead for power weapon, telesto for energy and blast furnace for kinetic. Gl
---
Its Will Smith from Youtube rewind. You are supposed to know it because it is memed A LOT
---
Only need 1 titan for applying melting point, 1 warlock for a well, rest should be GG hunters w/ nighthawk for max boss damage. Titans are the least needed for raids
---
Zavala can give you two different snipers from his reward engrams, and Shaxx can give you one. Just keep turning in tokens to them until you get a sniper with the perks you want. Banshee-44 can give snipers too, but you are less likely to get a sniper since I think he gives out more total items. 
---
You can use the website light.gg to view all possible perk combinations. 
---
Awesome thanks for the info :) 
---
The annual pass activities start at power level 610. You won't be strong enough until then, so you have plenty of time to decide. [This page has a chart](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/47465) showing what is included in the annual pass. 
---
Random round does bonus damage
---
Thanks mate! 
---
Thank you :) 
---
A lot of it depends on what raid you are doing. Some classes are better on some raids than others. A general rule of thumb is you can't have enough Warlocks. Melting point Titan is very good as long as you can apply it to the boss. I have done many raids with like 5 hunters and a Titan so it's definitely doable, having certain classes just make it easier (well of radiance with lunafaction boots makes everything easy).
---
lol definitely not comp that's for sure
---
[Not just any bedtime story.](https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/mark-of-the-great-hunt) It was Shakespeare's The Tempest. AND SHAXX KNOWS IT BY HEART. 
---
As a former child, I appreciate the nostalgia, but as someone who has been giving Destiny a break whilst at uni I don't get the joke. At the risk of killing the joke for everyone reading the comments, could someone explain it?
---
Shoot boss till freezing field pops up. Shoot smoking vents to reveal arc charges. Pick up arc charges and throw directly at boss. 3 should make it heroic. Bonus: arc charge the ship to turn off the freezing field if you have an extra one.
---
Our warlock has those boots but can’t raid often unfortunately... :/ 
---
No problem, good luck raiding 
---
Since no one responded to you with the real answer, here it is. Best lore entry in the game.
---
https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/mark-of-the-great-hunt
---
titan is very pretty but underutilized
---
Hope you crushed that pile of shit gun
---
Thanks! We got the first part of leviathan done last night with four people then realized we couldn’t go any further 🤣
---
Not they said they won’t because not enough of the community wants it back and would rather have actual good replayable content 
---
Sounds like you are only able to buy 1 at a time?
---
The patrols are significantly faster. Try to match a combat or collection patrol with your event and you'll get it so many ghost fragments you'll wonder why you even bothered.
---
Yes
---
Eh getting the Dredgen title isn't exactly the same as "following Dredgen Yor." The lore for this doesn't make a ton of sense.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
People who've played enough competitive crucible to get Not Forgotten. Those are the truly evil guardians.
---
Or forever 
---
I did try it out, I can see why people love it. I think bows just ain't my thing. My husband was jealous he has been dying to get this bow. I wish there was a way to just gift it to another player 
---
Why should they know what they are doing when they just leveled their characters to 50 in the span of a few days? 
---
Ace usually. And yes, getting it was a pain.
---
its on pc too
---
Absolutely would.
---
Ok thank you so much I will
---
That's the better choice.
---
I said summer,because by that time we'll see the game as it was meant to be, with all the micro transaction bs and such.
---
999,999 is only a visual max. Actual damage can far exceed that number.
---
Damn, I hope they give back the quest because now it's not in my inventory
---
I tried to troll with bubble... but there was a glitch so when I picked ward it would pop as sentinel
---
It's called you cant stand still for a single second.
---
There is a major difference.  Destiny handles it well, a game like this WILL have micro transactions, thinking otherwise is juvenile.
---
That said there is a scale, Battlefront and it looks like Anthem are set up to force players into micro transactions as in game earning of the items is not realistic even for the ultra hardcore.
---
Destiny while it has these same micro transactions makes it so 95% of the items can be earned in game play in a quick time just from playing I get nothing but dupes now from etched engrams.  Add in the stuff you can buy is all cosmetic.
---
Overwatch also did it well as it’s all cosmetic and can be earned in a reasonable timeframe and is all cosmetic however I bring it up as it was what sparked the craze yet many took the bad with the system and went to the extreme 
---
We all did my man, but just think, if it was Mara the situation would be very different.
---
You're only trolling yourself though,  it's a terrible strategy 
---
You missed a great chance to use the "is it a spider? Get it off!"
---
Talk to Amanda. Or, use google to find out. 
---
I’m sure she feels guilty but does asking someone to help you with something make you responsible for their actions?
---
#respect
---
Looks like everyone was just stealing his kills lol
---
Excuse me, but my fully masterworked Loaded Question would like a word.
---
Because it’s year one. I’d love to see bungie update year one year with added perks I think we would see a lot more varied loadouts 
---
When I go see her it doesn’t say I have a quest available.
---
Looks like it's a gun from Flan's Mod, probably a custom pack, though.
---
Say change my mind, comments something that changes his own mind.
---
I’m on Xbox. I’m on all the time pretty much. Just got the game on New Years and have been grinding every day since
---
Anthem=Cooperative story. I'm gonna give it a few months, but I really enjoy the demo. Co op games are also my favorite games to play
---
I can already tell that somebody is gonna take that title way too seriously and is gonna get r/whoooosh’ed
---
It was a joke....
---
Sometimes I wish Destiny had killcams. That dude would have lost his mind.
---
Grind for some good guns. Such as dust rock blues, ace of spades, THE LAST WORD (especially) and unlock the dreaming city too. Lots of good guns come from the dreaming city such as retold tale and twilight oath. After you get some good guns, yes you can play pvp only. And when you get some good guns grind for Luna’s howl and not forgotten.
---
Hahaha that’s kinda the point lol 
---
There's no good explanation, just bullshit. They want your time logged to be higher, that simple. 
---
Dude that happened to me yesterday
---
Well, guess who isn't getting any Wells of Radiance this week?
---
Their jump being the only thing that requires any effort does not change my mind.
---
Well I’m about to contradict my own self in saying that I am a warlock main, and there jump is the easiest for me. 
---
I call shenanigans
---
It's cuz when u do it on normal u can reload the zone  and get the same event in another serve (u can do the same event 4-5 times this way)
---
You misspelled “titan”
---
I love Warframe, but I have so many of its players because of this. Like Warframe is still very different in terms of playstyle, leave me alone, I'll play what I want
---
Must be one a them blinky hunters, ya know warlocks taught em
---
Yes as long as it's the same psn. Bungie holds everything on there servers online 
---
Noot noot motherfucker. 
---
Damn it!
---
*The Age of the Trickshotters has come anew*
---
Try doing any activity involving jumping puzzles on a warlock. I assure you, some skill is required. 
---
I use Jade rabbit, ep shotty, and hammerhead. For armour i use lunafaction (of course) and super is either Nova bomb or well of radiance. 
---
I thought this was obvious... 
---
I’ve “beat” Enkaar three time now and no TLW. I’ve read to transition through each stage of The Conversation slower but that doesn’t remedy the issue of the “Find Enkaar” milestone not changing to “Stop Enkaar” after you defeat the wizards and destroy the crystal. 
---
I can literally beat Enkaar, reset the region by going to the beginning of the area and all three draw challenges will be available as if I just entered the region again. 
---
The bubble is trash now, not a good strat
---
thanks man.
---
But don't forget about Paul! Their SCI-FI alien movie. CLASSIC!
---
5 hours. I got mine in 3.
---
You can but I’m not sure you can access the thing on those characters without the quest on them, I did
---
No its tied to the account unfortunately 
---
Atleast should be 
---
I don’t have an issue in any raids with my titan. 
---
I also don’t turn on voice chat most of the time. “WHAT DO THE DOTS MEAN? I GUESS ILL CHARGE IN AGAIN. MY SHOULDER IS CARRYING THE TEAM WHEN MY FISTS GET TIRED.”
---
And sometimes I spend time trying to figure out how to get the best shield throw combo chain. 
---
And my shoulder armor is gigantic. It makes my hammer throws look fucking *majestic*. 
---
Dang! Well, finally got to the part in the Luna Quest to get Glory Rank. Let's see what this Warlock can do. I haven't played since Fallout 76 came out. I did pop in one day to visit Ada-1 for the first time then I logged out. 
---
What gun is that, looks amazing
---
What about any other aspect of the Warlock class or is it just the jumping?
---
[my god roll op](https://i.imgur.com/ynWgwYS.png) 
---
*YES*
---
Do you have the destiny companion app? I’m a pretty solo player grinded up to 640 solo. Then joined a clan but post for fireteams regularly on the companion app, it’s very helpful just finding a group for a couple hours. I highly recommend it! You can post for raids, gambit, crucible anything.
---
It got really repetitive in one day, I hope they invent new skills that can drop from endgame activites or such then it would probably be a buy for me.
---
We'll wait, we'll see.
---
Youre gonna sit there, wearing Shards, and say that?
---
Lol
---
For my PvP Set up on Hunter:
---
Foetracer
---
Blast Furnace or Garden Progeny 1
---
Lord of Wolves
---
Crooked Fang
---
For my PvE set up on my Hunter:
---
Celestial Nighthawk
---
Blast Furnace
---
Wishbringer
---
Sleeper
---
For my Warlock, it's the same for PvP but with Transversives Steps for my Exotic armour
---
For my PvE for my Warlock:
---
Verity's Brow
---
Blast Furnace (I use it a lot lmao)
---
Riskrunner
---
Crooked Fang or Sleepless
---
That is true, but when I have 999 gunsmith materials, I really don’t need anymore. Lol.
---
Yep, I tried it on a friends and it still worked 
---
As a D1 player from day 1, forsaken is the taken king of D2 so for $10 I highly recommend it.
---
I’ve finished all except TLW, no season pass ):
---
It wouldn’t make sense to not apply to players leaving matches early because they intentionally quit. The point of the restriction is to keep people in matches and punish people who can’t or won’t stay. 
---
Who needs sources when you can act offended. Learned that in a community college.
---
Shards require more skill than all the warlock supers combined. You kidding me...lol
---
Ha!
---
Who let this guy into the chat?
---
you can go till 500 or so if you ahve forsaken by doing anything
---
public events strikes pvp etc
---
Counterbalance if you dont have or use Arrowbreak. If you do have Arrowbreak (which makes Redrix deviation only vertical, negating the effect of counterbalance) use Target Adjuster. Or id you feel you need a few extra shots use backup mag. 
---
this is why we dont have killcams
---
It's bugged ATM. Bungo has acknowledged it
---
It's not just a boulder, it's a rock
---
Yes. I was able to complete it with 3 BA weapons and 1 BA chest piece.
---
Pro tip: Never solo queue in Comp. 
---
What are these aspects in other classes? Titan "skill combo" is basically "hit it, hit it harder, then shoot what's left" when you're not channeling John Rambo from behind your barricade.
---
r/Whooosh
---
I just want lunas lol
---
Well for D3 to transition into an endless MMO Destiny 3 will have to be released. So I'll guess that, I guess.
---
What does this mean?
---
Tatara Gaze !
---
Tatara Gaze, you get it from sniper frames
---
Oh how i hate that ascendant challenge.. 
---
Getting closer to having all exotics possible. 
---
Make a post on LFG for "Luna's Comp Farm" and you'll get good people, trust me. It's all about getting those good people and working with them as best as you can. 
---
Breakneck (mowing down trashmobs), Wishbringer (for tougher enemies and blockers), Sleeper Simulant (boss DPS/killing invaders/invading)
---
or
---
Malfeasance (great for adds, destroys blockers, decent on bosses and invaders), Wishbringer again and  Hammerhead with Genesis since the Envoys have void shields it melts them.
---
I switch between top tree Sunbreaker with Synthoceps (better for boss DPS) and top tree Striker with Insurmountable Skullfort (unlimited shoulder charge is incredible for adds)
---
I actually researched my sources before arguing with someone and realized I was wrong so I corrected myself and applogized lol...
---
But sure, let's perpetuate a dead argument by making snide comments that benefit literally nobody.
---
Without DLC's I don't think you have a whole lot to do in between resets.
---
I haven't been into destiny since the end of TTK and bungie gave rise of iron to Xbox one when I didn't have it.
---
well then shit
---
50% melee range, 50% super damage and 300% melee damage kinda makes them needed for long chains vs harder foes
---
No?
---
BB literally requires no skill. It's just a panic super. Its basicly for people that cant get kills with other supers.
---
Oof. That’s depressing. I still dont like how RoI was next gen only. 
---
Stellar 10/10 invade
---
I mean, huge huge fan of first gen destiny but after they did that I kinda just, quit.
---
We need a DLC that replaces the soundtrack with Ska music.
---
I wish that was useful 
---
Hunters be like: “closed eyes and smashes bumper killing the entire enemy team”
---
Is he talking about affinity farming with a frost shield spam? It’s the only thing I could think of
---
Don't worry bro I'm omw, my Hammerhead has mulligan so I get missed shots back 
---
It's not forced really. Most of the guns you get through PvP are best used in PvP. So if you play PvP a lot you end up with good PvP weapons. Same thing goes for PvE stuff (breakneck, loaded question).
---
It seems weird to me that people who hate Crucible will do it for a gun that'll most likely sit in their vault because it's not useful for the content they like. I mean, to each his own. It's fine if anyone doesn't like PvP but you can't complain about hating content that you don't have to play. 
---
U kidding me this thing recks 
---
Yes it works here as well. I think that's how you get to one of the Easter eggs.
---
I wish they would open up the "haunted forest" event on weekends for the chance to get like D1 trials gear from it. It would give mercury something to do at least some of the time.
---
No no, pretty sure it's a JoJo reference.
---
Oh haha I should've realized that, my bad
---
Check in inventory 
---
This is the one damn thing I want in D2, I had so much fun and almost always cam in top 3. I remember one of my races I finished so far ahead in 1st place that the race ended before anyone else could finish
---
I dnt get it
---
found it, i'm new to this game haha
---
thank you
---
What?
---
Might be the modifier for today. Blackout I think it's called. 
---
Now do a 900
---
Maybe learn how to use it first? I've been gunning people down like crazy in Crucible.
---
looks to be the memory of cayde cloak but with the "no cape visual glitch"... it happens to my hunter half the time.
---
No problem mate! Enjoy the game!
---
I will say that killing those wielding it with an Auto Rifle is satisfying.
---
No doubt there. Remember when you could play a game at the chance to get ....... get ready for this one...... Any and everything in the game? If you put in the time or we're good enough, you could possibly receive any or all rewards. Not everything is achievable, it's not supposed to be and that's why it takes time or has a learning curve. Wanna know why some of these achievements or trophies are insane or hard as F? Cause it takes time and practice and dedication. Might not be worth the trouble but if you want 100% or a Platinum you'll do it. Why can't that be the case with unlockables or cosmetics or better weapons/armor? If I do the hard mode of a Raid, shouldn't it look cooler, have better perks and be unique to those who put in the work? Or should Eververse just sell em on a rotating weekly schedule? Lolol, drives me nuts sometimes.
---
Dang..
---
Personally, I haven’t completed Petra’s run, but I think the hardest part for me is relying on teammates. Idk, I’ve got the entire raid down, I just need people to know wut they are doing
---
Similarly to thousands of other players, I have all of them. So, guess I had to create 20+ posts about each of them?   
---
Imagine each player making the post here about each exotic.  
---
Oh, what a fun place this subreddit would be!
---
That might work for bo3 zombies
---
It's just the worst. I get screwed by those rocks everytime. 
---
To the left it's the chaperone ti the right its sleeper
