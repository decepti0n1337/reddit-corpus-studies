That doesn’t mean you did 70% of the bosses health just means you did 70 of your teams total which might not have been much. Plus you lost lol

Join up (the siva exterminators)
---
Wait till shadowkeep
---
Twas the 59.99  one.
---
Im never lucky with rng it took me 90 times to get the ikelos shotgun then as soon as I got it it got nurfed fml
---
I see that well rested
---
You got goomba stomped
---
Nice. I'd probably wimp out since I hate needles so much, but if I were to get a tat, I'd want it to be something like that. Nice and simple.
---
It matches you based on glory rank m8
---
Do you not see the arrow next to my name? Let’s look more carefully next time
---
Yeah that's the one I got
---
No, there are a couple or reputable carry/account recovery services out there. I doubt they would still be in business if Bungie was banning their clientele.
---
bungie won’t perma ban “bot accounts” 2nd they are not bot accounts they at least on pc are people using third party macros to fool the idle system 3rd i belive it has been stated some somewhere in bungie forums accounts found doing this will be given temporary bans... so it’s there people afking activities like gambit and crucible for  example people do this to avoid the 10 gambit matches for solstice
---
And how did it just changed order like that
---
Yea, it took me a while to decide what I wanted since I like very clean cut looking designs but I’m happy I settled on this one (:
---
amethyst veil
---
lmaooo.
---
Right fuck this 100 bullshit
---
Killing a giant thicc boi on a fish spaceship
---
Shader?
---
The trench barrel perk was changed forever ago.
---
I hope the surprise is they delete PvP so I don't have to play it anymore for my solstice/exotic quests.
---
How do I get it?
---
I know I was living under a rock and grinding for it since then
---
Ok thanks
---
Eververse. You have to wait for Tess’ inventory to cycle around until she sells it again.
---
PvP - Mk44 stand asides and Skullfort. Overshield while sprinting and ohk shoulder charge with instant recharge.   
---
  
---
PvE - Lunafactuons and Phoenix Protocol. No reload in well and super energy return for kills
---
that was the first thing I tried, unfortunately his toes were also immune
---
Bruh that sucks
---
## bruh 💯💯💯💯😝🤤

I used to work at a local Micro Center type company in my city, building custom computers and I built some time ago, before ryzen 3000 came out, a Ryzen 5 2600, 16gb ram 3200, b450 MoBo and a gtx1060 system for around €750 to a guy who specificaly said he only plays D2, War Thunder and Rainbow Six and said after a week that he always got over 90fps on max setting at 1080p.
---

---
Now that same system, after the launch of ryzen 3000 and the subsequently drop in prices on ryzen 2000 and 450/470 chipset motherboards, and pairin it with a gtx 1660ti instead of a gtx1060, I think you could get it for around the same price as the guy did almost a year ago, maybe for a bit more, like around €50-100 more expensive because of the newer GPU, but it will run destiny, and almost whatever games you throw at it on very high/ultra  settings at 1080p with no problems on getting over 60fps.
---
Shit I wrote the wrong title I’m so tried I cannt even typee
---
I meant it was nerfed ages ago and my friends told me that day nm cbs to change
---
HOW! HOW DO YOU LIVE WITH THAT PICTURE?????   
---
it's like 1mm off center and is triggering every OCD thing ever.   
---
i mean it's cool.  but i'm triggered now.
---
Apparently we have killed the same person at some point in our careers
---
Hmm. I can kind of see it lol
---
I’m saying it didn’t give my titan or hunter any gear.  Maybe because I didn’t do the menagerie bit after my warlock got the 690 set.
---
That would be cool! And thank you!
---
Why the fuck would you put a con on an exotic.
---
Name one fucking exotic that fucks you up for a little bit of a bonus
---
Exotics are suppose to be EXOTIC, not DETRIMENTAL, imagine having HALF RANGE on everything, you literally do no damage and your damage drop off is half the distance of anything else
---
Lol! I just get on lfg or the100 when i decide to start one, maybe we’ll run into each other!
---
You must have hard carried because I never received messages like this
---
jump into this planet! guardian!
---
*Know what to do* /╲/\╭( ͡° ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° ͡°)╮/\╱\
---
Paranoia has its advantages
---
It’s a bathrobe and it was one time.
---
Thanks for the fast response everyone!!  Appreciate it!
---
How TF do you have more than 30
---
I finished on my warlock and I got blue sets on my hunter and my titan.
---
"You killed me with something that isn't overpowered? Hacker"
---
Ah bummer but that sounds about right
---
*includes class specific exotics
---
But you don't want the super to go to waste. That dreg should be more appreciative.

F
---
Played since day one barely infuse/mw. Save like crazy, play a lot of content that can drop currated (raids,prime,etc) bounties (if i remember them, tho barely do) buy the odd one from spider when im there to restock mats back to 2k.
---
He's the only one I regularly watch! Really enjoy his content!
---
Literally came for this comment
---
Oh so you think you rich or something
---
???? What
---
At least we didn’t have to do the missions like last year
---
Holy mother of English
---
Ohh it's been more than one time buddy
---
This is your own channel lmao. Nice try.
---
U good bro?😹just trying to get other channels out there... don't be that guy
---
High resilience? Check. One-two punch Last Man Standing? Check. I'm ready to gut punch that bastard while he tries to stomp me away!
---
....sorry, I been embracing my inner Titan since I got that shotgun 🤣
---
That feeling when you button smash but want to hide it
---
Have u ever went fast
---
You guys.. are the real heroes!
---
Lmao
---
You tellin me that Wizened Rebuke and Blast Furnace are as broken as the following:
---
Lord of Wolves
---
The Last Word
---
Dust Rock Blues
---
Mindbenders Ambition
---
Erentil FR4
---
Ace of Spades
---
Mountaintop
---
Recluse
---
No kill tho?
---
Soooo cuuuute
---
RKO out of  no where that
---
Finally we get a catalyst
---
Yea lol the title made it seem like such an obvious attempt to badly self plug. Glad someone else noticed.
---
Leave it alone. It’ll be a good story to tell once someone finally notices it in person. 
---
Also, you’ll know it’s unique to you. One of my other tattoos the artist couldn’t get a perfect wrap around my arm so he just looked at me and said “is it ok if I freehand it”. I said the hell with it and let him do it. 
---
It actually turned out fantastic and the freaking hand coordination and artistic talent you have to own to pull that off is amazing. I can’t even draw a stick figure. :-)
---
So what’s the next tattoo? There’s always a second.
---
Destiny(Minecraft) good
---
Uhhhh ok
---
Hey you don't know.
---
Maybe his dog just died?
---
Oh shit,just saw your name :D well,sorry XD
---
What do you use asking for a friend that thinks the rest of titan exotics are dogshit
---
And bottom tree striker
---
That’s amazing! I know for a tattoo I’ve been thinking about I’ll get the Fallen house Sigils.
---
Well, I can't wait for the  TR3-VR and postmaster romance arc.
---
Very nice, nice placement to 😂😂. Cute smerk says it all.
---
Kitty!!!
---
Aye that steve1989
---
Nice
---
considering your posts have all been about this specific channel, and you said “other channels”, you just backed yourself into a corner. lmao 🤡
---
 What shader for the armor
---
Oh I haven't tried doing other activities after unlocking the chalice. i didn't know you receive "imperials" from other stuff.
---
Completely useless just the way I like it
---
NOT IN MY HOUSE!!!
---
Ahh nevermind, there's tons of similar question in this thread. Will browse through it instead!
---
I like how you just stopped, probably thinking "did....did that actually just happen?"
---
My warlock got left behind because of this. Used to love the variety of playing all 3 but it’s like a full
---
time job keeping up.
---
Noice
---
Ha! I just got it. I’m dumb. The first post I was like oh wow that’s an awesome tattoo. And I felt the feels. (Yes I still miss Dinklage). Then I got it. Nice.
---
Awesome!
---
Not unless you want to. You would need just 1 master worked for the moments of triumph triumph and the seal
---
Killed by your Scooty Puff Jr huh?
---
I use BoTF- Recluse and 1KV
---
snipe dont work? delete them with 1KV
---
Basically yeah, used to do that with the Black armory sniper and 1KV as well
---
Yeah forgot to mention that menagerie pretty much drops em from what i remember
---
You didn’t buy the broken one from Xur last week?
---
It's kind of appropriate that on PC, F is the key that accidentally deletes your enhancement cores.
---
Have my F too, OP.
---
Yeh, it’s a nice combo of quote and symbol/silhouette. The first quote that jumped into my head after I saw this post was Shaxx’s “You’re enemies can’t kill if they’re dead! Haha!”. Might be a little dark though 🤣.
---
Very cool! Happy Birthday Guardian!
---
i know right, i stopped banking motes because of his and i just wait at the gate to go snipe some noobs with my izanagi
---
Just be persuasive! My wife has played since day 1 and finally convinced me to start!
---
:D
---
I gotta get a girlfriend first 🤔
---
After close to a year of trying, I finally was able to do this last week. Was so excited I almost forgot to start boss damage :)

why? is so. AWESOME. I played 13 comp yesterday. and its a pain with a team that dont want to team play;)
---
What’s missing, might I ask
---
I would also like to chime in and point out that the golden gun has no scope on it so if you can hit someone from across the map when they’re the size of a fly then you deserve that kill.
---
Because we like warm tones and sparkles...
---
I just turned 19 five days ago... been playing since TTK. It's been 4 great years for me, which will unfortunately come to an end (for gaming in general) sometime in the next few years.
---
How come?
---
Yea, i get what you mean, I just liked the way it looked with my style and thought it would bring it together. Some people seem to disagree but that’s okay, I still like it (:
---
Congrats dude. Been stuck in heroic hell for ages now. maybe one day I’ll get there
---
Navy's picking me up after I graduate Texas A&amp;M. Not gonna get a whole lot of gaming time after that, except on leave.
---
Getting all my gaming time in now, while I have the chance. Summer's a good time for it.
---
How manyish have you done?
---
I've been hearing this a lot, why people so down on Autorifles, they're all I use.
---
Probably close to 100 by now
---
He does have a point there can't deny it lol.
---
I posted to show how it would look all together. By your view I should have just showed it on a piece of paper. If you don’t like it as a tattoo on specifically myself, I’m sorry, but I do and wanted to share (:
---
I want to upvote but its 69 upvotes now
---
I prefer hip-fire grip and box breathing.

I’m doing that and I just found out if you stand right up against the thing where you deposit charges nothing attacks you lmao
---
_indian accent_ hello bootiful
---
Too bad it doesn’t count towards the getting a seal trophy/achievement I’m still sitting at 98% T_T
---
Really? I thought it was Sunday.
---
Looks great, how much did it cost to make?
---
Oh yeah, for sure. Luna's/NF is still good, My guess is that Trace Rifles will be getting another buff in shadowkeep making them insane
---
But nighthawk gives the perk that penetrates targets... So you just...
---
You know what, I'll let you figure it out.
---
Wait ya what? And the other team lost so many motes. What kind of sorcery is this?
---
Thanks for helping!

Bow targeting? Shard it.

Dude, it's a game. Stop taking it so seriously and getting mad at pvp players for doing something you don't like. Some people play the game just to have fun. You should think about what you are doing right now and realize how stupid this is. Just try to enjoy the free time you have.

---
It’s a meh but one of the best ad clearers for sure. Fun for regular strike playlists
---
next horror movie
---
I loved the supercell pls bungo pls
---
Even with headshot damage most good handcannons, special weapons, Even Meta smgs or just most Meta weapons in general, still does more damage in pve and pvp
---
F F F
---
I think you’ve got to pick it up off the floor iirc, like from a chest or powerful enemy
---
After grinding out the majestic set on one class as a parent to two very little lights, I'd rather buy the glows than have to grind those out too. As for the colors, I'm fine with the arc because it's the my favorite shade of blue.
---
It was sold last week at Eververse for Bright Dust, but it unfortunately isn’t being sold for Dust this week
---
i wish warlocks had better exotics. But DAMN, do they look cool
---
Wow that was a good grind and what does that give you from the event? 2 glows almost 3? And what else? See my point here?
---
Lol I haven't been on D2 for a while and thought this was a glitch thanks
---
Pretty damn perfect example
---
Can I just have me first curse back
---
Got that late in D1 and hated it. Zhalo or khostov would be better.
---
Idi nahui!
---
Full honesty, I got bored by d1. The setting eventually brought me in to 3, but 1....
---
To much Activision and not enough Bungie.
---
Yes!! This is the type of tattoo that one should be proud of. Not those little class symbols or "eyes up guardian" nonsense.
---
This looks epic!
---
Since when has nighthawk penetrated targets?
---
That's a actually not correct
---
Yess
---
Wait don’t you get a 2.0 armor solstice armor set by completing them and masterwork one piece of armor? Oh am I wrong
---
The classic 5-6 Stack experience.
---
how so
---
Whatever, Bad Juju slapped during y2. I didn't play much y3 so I can't speak to that, but when TTK first launched I used it a lot for PvE content.
---
This is ridiculous, what in the hell where your bot teammates doing?
---
No you're right
---
There was one guy who posted what a Destiny tattoo should look like. And then there's you lol
---
I rolled a Titan for solstice, and my god striker is so OP, so stupidly OP.
---
I'm sorry.
---
I mean was there anything I could have done differently to prevent me from getting spawn killed with 2 different supers ? Don't think my skill had anything to do with this lol. Sure I missed some half assed shots from the bow but if I had hit those shots it wouldn't have made a difference.
---
It's raining dregs! Hallelujah!!
---
They should've just let you keep your guns and add new exotics to earn. It's lazy to just keep taking away then re-releasing once again the same gun you already had a few months ago. It's not fun to me anymore, you guys should try GTA online if you want a game that creates new content instead of just making you earn the same small pool of weapons over and over again. Borderlands 3 is coming out soon, so there is actual real competition coming. Destiny really should respect it's player base more!
---
Comedy gold.
---
Not super nova, handheld nova. Converting the grenade to practically a shotgun shot.
---
Devi fare le taglie di azzardo eccelso
---
Never asked for it either but that's their call because big daddy Activision isnt bankrolling them any more. We get what they give us because it's cost effective. Could you start a game up and make the money you made off the sales pay your overheads for years ahead?
---
I don't know video editing for shit but if anyone here does, y'all know what to do...
---
I love HCs so cant relate
---
I get that it’s rng
---
and I know Bungie doesn’t have anything personally against me 
---
but it is rough that after so many clears still do not have 1k, anarchy, and still haven’t even gotten 1 threat level - last scourge run I got three helmets though
---
I have personally spawned all the way to the start of the mission after being in the thrall room for more than 10 mins and dying.
---
It should I agree, but it’s heading in a good direction imo. And it is introducing tons of new weapons and armor soon, plus I don’t mind the occasional weapon reintroductions.
---
*our baby
---
While I see your point, I’m gonna say thats not necessarily the case. If I can find the article I was reading I’ll link it. But what I read was that towards the end of the solstice Eva is going to let us re-roll our majestic set using the fragmented keys. So in theory you’ll be able to start shadowkeep with an armor 2.0 set tailored to you.
---
Will you find another armor set you like? Yeah probably.
---
Yea, in the next expansion, they're reworking mods and perks and stuff.
---
If the Solstice armor doesn't get the rework, then you'd be correct.
---
But it glows and shit!
---
Fucking bullshit class
---
dragon_1308vamp will still send you a message saying you didn't bank when you should have
---
Oof, I’m East US. I’ll check the timezone difference it’s just about 10am here, I get out of school at 12.
---
Yeah might be a bit tough
---
i dont think he hating on smart play or disengaging when hurt. the thing about hunters,(which seems to be a popular opinion)  is the always run away at the sing of  trouble. you go as far as blowing wind in their direction and they book it. i believe its the classes mobility that encourages this elusive playstyle. annoying but to each their own.
---
Sure thing!
---
owo? I thought that was atmospheric glow. hm
---
How dare hunters disengage a gunfight they’re losing lmao
---
Is 20 seconds really the time?
---
And isn't the instant regain only possible with Nezarecs Sin, so wouldn't Contraverse Hold and insta-regain mutally exclude itself?
---
With that light level, you don’t need a carry. Just watch some videos on how to do it and get on the Destiny Companion app. There are people trying to do Levi all the time on there. It may take a few tries to find a decent group, but that’s LFG.
---
This is completely incorrect. The solstice armor is being brought through to armor 2.0 and will be the first Shadowkeep updated set available. It’s great to have.
---
Yeah
---
They were new players I'm pretty sure, around level 13-14
---
By God I think you're on to something
---
Correct me if I’m wrong, but I’m pretty sure the numbers don’t work like that.
---
Solstice armor is the first set getting the rework.
---
100% agree. Bungie seems to have a massive hard on for hand cannons.
---
Season of opulence dlc, if you don't have the annual pass you cant get it.
---
I have it
---
What platform are you on
---
What the fuck is that shader please?? Cause fuck I want my ghost to be a pimp too
---
I really would prefer they just brought Red Death back. As a pulse hand cannon something feels wrong about it
---
You can transfer from ps to xbox, but you won't have access to the content. You can still use weapons, gear, and I believe progress quests that do not require dlc content directly.
---
Nope, consider Destiny new light as the demo, got to pay for the fun stuff.
---
the game is going free later this year, the dlcs arent

Maybe monte carlo will be a quest.
---
I don't agree with the pulse rifle one considering fusions and shotguns still exist
---
Thank you!!
---
Go to Nessus on the barge there’s a chest next to sweeper bot  Calus 2.0. Get the chest and you get the quest
---
If you hate Destiny and Bungie, why are you on this subreddit
---
Mines pretty good too though some times it sticks when I turn the revolver
---
damn, this is just upsetting to watch. why is it even an option do discard cores, I mean who deletes cores??? wtf... bungie should and has to remove that from the game.
---
I'm not saying it wasn't fun but it was literally sickening after the first day lol
---
When you die to a dawnblade and respawn just in time for them to fly across the map and kill you again.
---
Same here
---
That’s what I’m saying, his wording implies it’s an entirely F2P game
---
I’d love a hawk moon even if it was another exotic handcannon
---
They already did that
---
It keeps showing up on my feed, I did play Destiny for 3 years.
---
From d1 I think
---
I mean it would be a neat thing to add to eververse
---
Complaint? Ain't no complaint, well not to your friend anyways, to Bungie. That Super is underpowered as heck. I'm jtnimpressed he pulled this off with it. Send him my regards
---
You can save your character between all platforms. That doesnt include game or dlcs. The word cross save is self explanatory.
---
Shoulder charge got me lol
---
I liked it, makes for an easy target.
---
Can we start a petition for it to come out with cross play this is absurd
---
Right now people are grinding solstice armor or any seals they want/are close to(I guess there’s a deadline for a pin and people want that)
---
I’m not sure about everyone else but I for sure am grinding out tokens, cores, planet mats, bright dust, whatever else in preparation for shadow keep
---
As far as pvp weapons go: the last word, high range shotgun/fusion rifle, and a hammerhead machine gun seem to be quite popular in pvp and easily attainable. If you really want the top weapons available you can try grinding for recluse and mountain top
---
It's a meme not a political statement
---
Who's that behind those Foster Grants?
---
Yes you can.
---
Yes
---
The Raid is very fun. Best Destiny raid imo, and I’m gonna lead my friends through it when cross save comes out. 
---
But I’m so glad I have the gun so I don’t have to the Riven x3 a week knowing if I’ll get lucky or not.
---
Buy it with silver or bright dust at Tess
---
Sounds about right
---
Yes but it would probably wipe your ps4s progress
---
You can definitely tell how much time went into that. I really like the highlights of red! All together, it looks amazing!
---
I will admit, the ice skating rink with the hockey puck and the soccer field at the farm were a nice addition at certain points in D2
---
Game of thrones reference ???? - “SHAME”
---
I got 1k a while ago after 6 runs. But as an act of Balance I havent received a single god roll since Forsaken launched( I started playing during the black armory season)
---
Well done, you deserve a orange arrow.
---
Sleeper or Hard Light in confined spaces or Ward of Dawn.
---
Thank you I’m taking a break
---
It only puts purple on some things. Normally tertiary colours. This ghost only has two colours, so it just uses white and gold
---
*Laughs in erentil*
---
Isn’t that the recluse in your hands? Just shoot him. He’ll die before he gets a shot off.
---
&gt;Wow take a fucking chill pill man
---
Take one yourself. Grow a spine while you are at it.
---
SPOILER
---
I have combo detectors for every planet. Most of them are guiding light and telemetry, though some are speed demon.
---
Feels like a witch hunt..
---
Sorry will delete it and post it in the right sub reddit
---
We had a guy in our group that got 1kV twice on his first run because of the token wish.
---
I've never been so angry while laughing so hard.
---
RICK KACKIS HHHHHHHHHHHHHHEEEEEEEEEEEEREE.
---
What I do is match new models with prospective employers and you can earn 1-3k a day.
---
You know, you could've just taken a screenshot.
---
I am also confused
---
You tell em!
---
&lt;3
---
It's supposed to drop from all of the forges. Then again I wouldn't put it past Bungie to make it drop more often from the bow forge.
---
Good idea. Me too. Time to catch up on some other games and read and watch some movies for awhile
---
I would've panicked
---
I legit miss Eris. The hive are easily my favorite, and I’m so excited to hear what happened to her after the red war started.
---
You don't have Recluse do you
---
Search “Shaxx dodgeball” on reddit. Turns out it’s canon.
---
lol I just bought the same CPU... didn’t even consider this. BEST BLUE ENGRAM EVER
---
Haha yeah that was nice xD
---
True... Btw. Why we don't wipe hive completly? I could try do this...
---
i don't know, maybe your combination blow was not x3 or you didn't pick up all the orbs from the knights?
---
He's the actual user that got the tattoo, he's linked as the model in the post
---
Combination Blow x3 (top tree arcstrider) + liars handshake (exotic gauntlets) + last man standing shotgun with one-two punch perk
---
I just got 4 of 5 pieces of my iron truage armor with enhanced sniper perks and I love it but its gonna be obsolete in a couple of months and that makes me sad
---
Well if you’re on Xbox, that’s what we do. Account recoveries and carries to Fabled. We won’t do the quest steps, but we can drag you all the way to 2100 pretty easily. 383 Fabled completions since season 6!
---
That’s exactly what i did. When i ran out of super, I learned that I can stand on the wall, shoot the suros regime for life and switch to the bad juju to build my super. And I got 3 eggs in there. I was showing off today lol
---
If it makes you feel better, during a Scourge run I got the scout rifle back to back with the EXACT same roll.
---
It wasn't even a good roll either (Also still don't have Trench Level)
---
NF is legitimately still good on PC, i crush with it all the time
---
Lucky. I'm grinding it but it seems like I mostly get put on a team that does not know what they are doing and get destroyed or sometimes one that does super well and wins massively. There are no good games where both teams are neck in neck
---
What. No way. F ing bungie why did i grind that for if ur gonna lower the bar everytime later
---
Oh right
---
Or shoot in a bubble
---
Repost
---
Balance is an illusion. buff.. nerf... buff... nerf...  just stop. Please. Leave it alone.
---
If you’re a Titan (I can’t see it being possible as a hunter, sorry. Maybe a warlock jump?) you can dance (not literally I mean like make strategic jumps and make feint your movements) around the ledge of the map where you can fall off and die, and juke the striker super. I found out that if the Striker Titan in his super is under you while in mid air, use your shoulder charge. It won’t hit him if you time it right, but will launch you behind him while he spams left click to go the other direction, and now you’re far from him, so gun him down, rinse and repeat, and with luck, he falls off the edge (Also easy to do against pole-dancer hunters) I know what ur thinking, “lol what r the chances tho?” Trust me friends. This is just a tip for anyone who cares :)
---
At least you don’t use handheld supernova lmao
---
In preparatuon for cross save and since I won’t have a pc with which to play til December I bought the full package for the ps4 summer sale up to Forsaken. I have a few characters max level for base game on my blizzard account. If I make a new character on said new ps4 title, how will that affect things?
---
What kind of damage do you need to get 199 percent damage dealt
---
i can appreciate the grind for all of those but... mountaintop
---
P: Juju, suros, night watch, wish ender
---
S: polaris, ikelos sg
---
H: outrageous fortune
---
Ill try it next time.
---
The kind that kills 3 prime evils
---
still, must be some inventory...
---
I know that feel, I'm sitting at 1800 on comp failing to get the final 300 I need
---
The smoke even pierced the gernade
---
Nope. Just lost sectors and public events, and then hope that RNG is kind to you.
---
Believe. Its not as bad once you find the symbols. I just looked at a map online. I wasn’t figuring it out on my own. I also learn that enemies spawn were you need to go next. That helped guide me too.

I can't get even get past 1000 glory to get close to the recluse..I know it's not RNG but solo que is kinda RNG..You can get stuck with people who don't play the objective or people that are great.
---
You'll be able to set a keybind to access your pursuits directly, if you're on PC.
---
I think this is a genius idea.
---
2nd raid 1k, 3rd for Tarrable. Only done scourge 4 times, ill get it next run.
---
 Congrats!  I’m working on MT right now myself. I’ve already unlocked Luna’s, Revoker, and Recluse as a solo player this season, so I can definitely respect the grind!  Sadly I’m only at 100%/35%/75% of MT quest...it’s the worst for sure.

---
Saiyan lll
---
Afk forge farm, turn into shards, buy the materials you need. Rinse and repeat.
---
Just tried this and I can confirm that you can mix n match glow. I’m using both solar and void.
---
Mabye just do rumble? And not be a dick?
---
PS. Might be able to rubber band the joysticks
---
How do I find the essay? I want to nerd out plsthx
---
Recluse requires 0 rumble, only wins and 2100. Even if it was changed to now require that I don’t think you deserve recluse if you’re just going to cheese for it
---
Just play them man, it doesn't have to be done in one day
---
Warlocks have a great support super. That's all. Nova is ok in pve, zappy digits are good in pvp but it's no bottom tree striker. 
---
If you're like me your probably sick of running support, I'm used to mages being DPS and tanks being able to tank. BUFF BUBBLE!!
---
I don't know where that came from, Obsidian Mind is what I meant.
---
Here's the source btw. https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/Update/47677
---
Thanks :3 it is very pretty Armor and I’m happy with it :3
---
They definitely mean redrix broadsword because that quest requires 25 each of QP, Comp, and rumble
---
Valor just needs you to load something and it should work. As for the others, did you have the hunter armor at the same time as the warlock?
---
Quest is easy, you can have it in a day.
---
Nova I really enjoy in pve zappy boi has great ad clear with crown of tempest dawnblade also has great ad clear and well is amazing at supporting and dps
---
Buy them from spider or forge farm while afk
---
I have all pvp pinnacle weapons including NF except mountaintop, that quest is more annoying then solo-q comp above 4000, guess ill just wait till they neef the quest
---
What's your loadout for gambit using polaris lance?
---
Can confirm with 100% certainty it still drops
---
Source: Just got mine like a week ago from a strike
---
In Crucible I disagree, PVE yeah I see it
---
For pve yeah sure why not but doesn't stop people taking it into pvp :(
---
Ouch. That can't be too many people can it? That is brutal though.. I would be raising hell on Bungie's site for that one bud.
---
I don't even want an exotic, just want threat level lol.
---
First fusions, now this.
---
This is a happy moment
---
Yeah I quit destiny during Forsaken after I put ~500 hours in with no non quest year 2 exotics while all my friends had multiple in way less time
---
World's First is pretty much limited to PC guys anyways. I hope that changes.
---
TIL. thanks. I didn't bother running eaz after getting my set. Figured I was done grinding. But looks like I'll be back to find better perks.
---
🤫
---
Always willing to help a fellow guardian.
---
We might be. And here I thought I was the only salty streamer hater around
---
There's only 2 i believe. The last man standing (can be obtained through the reckoning). The other can be obtained trough the crown of sorrow raid. (Forgot the name of this one).
---
Ah, click bait for your channel I see. Immediate thumbs down
---
Eh, I bought Shards from Xur this weekend because I didn't have it and not one, not two but THREE more have randomly dropped for me since Friday night.
---
Three exotics in one weekend and all three were the one item I purchased from Xur? Random chance my ass.
---
Спасибо. Если бы мог передать на английском корректно, то сделал бы. Шеелом надо менять  не потому что он плох, а из-за того что не апают точную раму(все апнули кроме этой). Луна являются моим любимым револьвером и я говорил про ап их в ПВЕ.
---
No one is going to watch your video when you make a post as click-baity as this. This post is akin to those god awful "you wont believe what happened next" videos
---
I immediately tune out bad-faith criticism ("Devs don't even play their own game") because it's so blatantly false and insulting. It's not constructive at all.
---
The post shed a lot of light on aspects of the how the game is designed (I had no idea how much seasons overlapped. I had assumed that the rune system was designed after learning lessons from the synth system), and I hope some of that transparency sinks in and we can get some non-hyperbolic discourse.
---
I suppose you’re right.
---
Fake, Spam, Trash....Ban, report.
---
It’s an old vid. It’s my hazard of the cast with the ornament on. Think I might have sharded it!
---
*Hunters outplaying you*
---
We have mega awesome super neutral game
---
austringer is love, austringer is life.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
what roll you using? I got the full bore, accurized, snapshot, opening shot, range MW.
---
Mountaintop....
---
Lol
---
Duke!!!!!
---
Yeah, I can just imagine how frustrating this'll get at times. My greatest holdup right now is getting too anxious about dragging my teammates down. I've only got a Warlock to play with, so maybe a good neutral play support style is what I should go for. I keep hearing "stop after 2 consecutive losses", which sounds like very good advice too. Thanks man, congrats again!
---
Also vanguard weekly bounties bless up
---
Nope we must be torn from the same cloth!  Actually had to leave a raid cause the kids kept talking Streamers and their "beef" with other players was cringey as hell.  I'm gonna enjoy the downvotes we receive for this.  Too bad I can't bank em in Gambit.
---
I’d say if you want to play current content, get forsaken on battle net for 40 it includes the forsaken annual pass, as cross save will be out next week on the 21st. If you are not Interested In the current season(opulence) or any post forsaken seasons then wait until shadowkeep as you will get all year 1 content (vanilla warmind Osiris)+shadowkeep for I think 40? Or for 60 your get shadowkeep plus the annual pass for year 3.
---
This will get a nerf but bungo will ignore the mess that is lmgs and 1k voices.
---
Sounds like someone can't finish a kill....
---
I recommend flying towards them as a warlock or titan and aiming your weapon and not missing
---
Why would anyone say that anything is broken in Blind Well...it's a meaningless PvE encounter now.
---
Surrounded. That's it. Everything else is just a bonus.
---
I'd rather drag my balls through broken glass than "head on over" to your god awful stream
---
You could've used Golden Gun or Swarm + Tractor and melted the boss faster
---
Yeah, they said they were going to buff the drop rate for Suros Regime and end it there. Just kidding, but seriously, whats up with Auto Rifles?
---
I'm also ok with this
---
I hope so too. But, I wouldn't hold my breath.
---
Fortunately there are some level-headed folks like you and I who can discuss it.
---
You talking mad shit for someone who gets healing, +35% deeps, and instant reload &gt;:[
---
Test some weapons yourself 
---
You need your own loadout
---
You've probably missed the actual times to play said events. Not entirely sure Bungie would screw that up, as they're the ones that keep that data, but you're asking the wrong folks. You need to ask Bungie themselves.
---
Gratz! Just collected mine too :D
---
Glory level. 
---
Sometimes stacks are not always what they appear. 
---
The randoms however are being matched with equal or around similar glory.
---
What even is that
---
It’s the “eye” of your ghost!
---
Where does it say that in his essay? Am I just blind?
---
How does liars handshake compare to fully stacked winters guile?
---
The ahamkara are aware that they are in a game so beware.
---
&gt;Gambit 
---
To make regular gambit worth playing :P
---
Yeah this works especially if you can go off the map around a building
---
Ok it seams you are correct. Thank you.
---
I’ve been running Prometheus Lens lately and it’s basically recluse but it needs special ammo. People have been sleeping on Trace Rifles so you’re probably right about them getting a buff.
---
I have a Night Watch with a super fast reload. Like, almost faster than Outlaw reload
---
Thats fair but you could have gotten way higher easier. Match game isnt as tough as people make it out to be and gives a full 1% dunno why im getting downvoted for speaking the truth lol. Hard to hear all the way up at 5500 i guess.
---
ash factory right?
---
So how do you know that wasn't a repost from Twitter, like most of the posts on here are? You reeing (all noise, no point) doesn't really show that the other post was original, it just shows that you probably spend too much time on this app.
---
I feel ya, really annoying how I have to grind for 30-40 hours of reckoning to even have 10 spare Rations drop for me rn. (My drop rate is 1 every 4-5 hours, fucking ridiculous)
---
&gt; Who would win?
---
&gt; A well designed encounter
---
&gt; or
---
&gt; Six joining allies bois
---
Ah, I see you are a man of culture as well.
---
Have you tried the recluse I heard it is really good
---
It almost certainly costs more to make than $10, because it is limited run.
---
We only went for 200k anyways so that was way more than we needed.
---
What a brave Titan....
---
You should try guided raids.  We used to do them but it took longer to find a seeker half the time
---
