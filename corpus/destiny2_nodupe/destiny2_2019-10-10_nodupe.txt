I was just about to comment this. Fuck.

---
---
Should be in collections
---

---
If not you can get a version of it from Menagerie
---
"Great_Pighty_poo.jpg"
---
Have you looked in your collections?
---
I’m a pvp god.
---
Don’t mind the flair
---
Ngl im there rn
---
We should eat children to save the environment.
---
That’s a dirty imperative roll you got there my dude, I got a very similar roll for mine :D, just change out the rampage for multikill clip.
---
^^CLENCH
---
Probably because Taco Bell isn’t basic Mexican food.
---
Totally forgot about Collections, thanks!
---
No problem
---
The helm is Saint-14 exotic, gloves are titan escalation protocol gloves, chest and mark is the normal crucible drops or token reward and the legs are the eververse season 9 titan legs currently in the store for bright dust
---
Hunter Gang babyyy
---
Eh, I killed myself with a rocket launcher by accident, was brought back by my strike team, then promptly killed myself with the rocket launcher AGAIN right away when I forgot to switch my weapon. So embarrassing.
---
I constantly fall of cliffs.. very accident prone in general with this game.
---
I have everything but the bergusia key, I tried talking to ada and nothing happened
---
I forgot the boss if the vault if glass qnd rrally only remember that it was a vex raid
---
Ps4
---
There was 12 months to do the content my dude. Just because I regulared the game doesnt mean I'm addicted.. *Scratches arm* shit I gotta go play some destiny, getting withdrawls.
---
Nah your not a titan OEM
---
Hot
---
bungie. net is probably down
---
Well, would ya look at that!
---
Oy what the fuck I've had this game for how many years now and this is news
---
Do you have the key mold in your quests
---
Minus 50 points for shotgun ape Titan.
---
Oh okay that clears it up. Thank you!
---
Challenge is always good.
---
I thought this was my titan for a second. Golden gang.
---
But it already is a template, been around for about a month I think?
---
Guilty! Not sure what I'm doing half the time..
---
The mods that you used for armor 1.0 don't work for armor 2.0
---
You need new mods for that
---
I'm in the same boat, lol
---
For sure. On pc I know I couldn’t go to the moon before I got shadowkeep.
---
Still haven't done it myself....That's an F for me
---
This is gonna get taken down because it’s a lotto post. And also day one for these guns was 1-2 seasons ago so why are you posting them?
---
I haven’t found anyone with my problem. I don’t actually have any kind of anxiety when meeting people in real life, even thought English isn’t my native language I can speak it fluently and most of the time I feel really good about meeting and talking to new people in real life, however all of that goes out the window when online, it’s the weirdest thing. I just keep thinking about not slowing people down, and get super conscious about everything, even tho after I analyze it, I wasn’t particularly slow or bad at learning the raid and communicating. Sadly, at the end I never found a clan in which I felt at home, and season of the drifter was my last. Shadowkeep looks great, but decided not to come back because of this.
---
Are you sure? Last season it did.
---
Two words: "freelance." "Playlist." I got it from 0 glory in an hour and a half on my hunter :)
---
Because while destiny is technically free to play, Sony treats it as a $60 game with a 100% sale probably. It didn't start free so it doesn't work the same
---
As I've gotten older, this has become my life.
---
Everybody has a rough time their first few raids. I was a nervous wreck for mine. Everybody knows doing your first raid is scary, so don't sweat it.
---
 Remember to breathe ,ask questions if you need to, ask to repeat something, rephrase if needed,ask for tips, ask for load out suggestions,ask what you should be using if you don't know, and try to have fun. Its better to ask 100 questions and understand what you're doing instead of asking none and have no clue what to do. 
---
I promise you if you search for a nice group then they will make your raid experience 100x better. I would definitely recommend you do the leviathan raid first. You can watch videos on youtube, so you have an idea of what to do. 
---
You can raid and I wouldn't shut down the idea of doing it. I remember telling my boyfriend, "I will never touch a raid because I'm not good enough and I'll just mess everything up!". Needless to say I ended up raiding and I actually had fun once I wasn't scared half to death and over thinking every little detail. 
---
Relax,enjoy the experience! If you have any questions then you can feel free to ask.
---
Dang
---
Hey man, low glory should play with low glory. If you’re 3000 glory and you matched with someone on your team with 800, it’s a waste of time. It’s competitive crucible, nothing competitive about having to carry a bad player in a rank they shouldn’t be in.
---
Working on getting it. That build is disgusting
---
I’m home surprised that there’s not a dedicated sub for just weird steam usernames
---
Ignore this...
---
its so damn easy to figure out too, for a few of them.
---
Yeah, there have been several posts made in the last week where people game sharing didn't share the season pass.
---
thats a YOU problem. 
---
Go back to destiny 1 or something.
---
Its an update for f2p and NEW players also. 
---
Not everything is done to relive things. Move on and enjoy the game.
---
It is adjusted, but still easier.
---
wait, they walled it off? that sucks, that was fun to take screenshots of me just emoting in there
---
I feel like an old man coming back after leaving in D1 taken king, game is so different now
---
yeah i just realized that as well. i wanted to chill in there for a bit while waiting for a friend... kinda made me sad.
---
Or, hot take here, put on the spoiler tag?
---
Man I need this but I’m horrible at crucible never even stepped foot in competitive lol.
---
Which gun is it referring to? I have subjunctive I love it
---
You should do the quests with the name 
---
Introduction: something.
---
Hell yes!
---
I got it from 0 glory in an hour and a half in the freelance playlist...
---
go see Amanda Holiday at the tower. she's the one who gives you the campaign
---
Any list of the exotics I can get without touching PvP?
---
In my experience there's always that one exotic that suddenly makes you a PvP player. For me in D1, it was the Khvostov 7G. Then in 2 it was the MIDA Multi Tool.
---
Gnawing hunger &amp; age old bond.
---
His body was on the poster. This is long past spoiler warnings.
---
Cool and all but it pains me as a warlock to not see you orb skating
---
Classic mix is connection based though. . . .
---
Do you play on console? On PC it was super easy I thought but that may have been because the aim assist wouldn’t have been enabled for me and maybe it tries locking onto him and not the gun? That’s just my guess tho.
---
Ummm that ain’t your work mate. The artist is Ryan DeMita and he’s a concept artist for Bungie https://www.artstation.com/artwork/9oZVy
---
F my dude
---
You don’t have to. Just keep waiting and just get one or two black armory mods a day. Mods aren’t required btw
---
Wah wah
---
😂😂😂😂😂
---
Yeah that's lame if true. I always like the lowest difficulty speed runs of nightfalls for a gear drop unique to the strike, what a shame.
---
poopy
---
Will do. Thanks
---
And you didnt even capture any zones. No wonder you guys lost.
---
So, basically, what you’re saying is, “waah waah 👶 the game is harder and I don’t like it!
---
I gotta look up the requirements next I'm on, the name sounds sick.
---
Those menagerie mods tho
---
The rapid fire frame is the worst shotgun archetype for PvP and the best dps wise for PvE.
---
Pinnacle weapons have custom perks, it's not Pinnacle weapon. It's a "Ritual weapon"
---
200+ lol I'm still getting used it it and the non changeable exotics kind of suck but I like it so far
---
Why is your guardian surprised?
---
The details are it costs around 24 CND for this look lmao. Looks good but damn man!
---
Perfection
---
Don’t worry, Fenchurch will bitch about having to set up a stall.
---
You only do the invitation questline once, the chalice is account wide. The reason you cant aquire the chalice on your alt is because your pursuits are full.
---
Nvm, I’m dumb as hell. And, apparently, blind.
---
#PARRY THIS YOU FILTY CASUAL
---
Try capping a fucking zone instead of worrying about your kd......
---
its the new light power boost
---
Can you explain a bit more about those exotic quests? And I’m playing on ps4,  help would be appreciated
---
it's a meme dude. calm down. there's plenty of posts telling you how. many resources pointing you in the right direction. even people in game willing to help.
---
Wtf have you been feeding your wife when she was pregnant? I have 2 kids and their sticky blackish-greenish poo had absolutely no smell.
---
I need to be apart of this clan that was great lmaoo
---
Ok so I just started playing again after not playing for a year and I did my transfer from Blizzard to Steam successfully. My character is there. However all my equipment is gone and I only started with all 750 stuff. I have access to all planets but no quests on Earth (no Enhance!, I understand this is a bug that's yet to be fixed. Seriously), and also no main storyline quest like all my friends have. 
---
What am I supposed to do? Bungie has no support system whatsoever.
---
This one is mostly just for pvp, have another for pve with major on. And I often find myself getting that second kill on the last bullet ^^
---
That helm ornament is awesome.
---
Ohhh- I see
---
Then pay 34 dollars.
---
i have the same problem.
---
Mainly at the final boss. Tons of frame rate late. But after 2 hours we beat it and got divinity.
---
No, but I have imagined a universe where Ikora is useful.
---
Thanks!
---
(A copy &amp; paste for the constantly asked pinacle/ritual weapons/quests. )
---
Pinacle weapon quests DO NOT EVER GO AWAY. 
---
You can get all the pinacle quests no matter the season. 
---
YES. if you reach fabled and then lose rank finishing up the quest steps in a season, you will have that count as a completed step when you reach it. But if you don't finish the quest on the season you hit fabled, you have to hit fabled again. 
---
Mountain Top seekers, you can use a kill lobby to get the quest done. No this is not banable, but it will trigger some players. Basically you need enough people to fill a lobby. Youtube a guide. 
---
Good hand cannons for lunas howl are trust, west of sunfall seven, ikelos, service revolver. (Console)
---
Or
---
A good rounded 140/150 ( nation of beasts, kindled orchid, spare rations) for pc.
---
You can not get Not forgottens quest till you finish lunas howl's quest. 
---
ANYBODY can get to fabled. You just need either luck, a team or persistence.  
---
Recluse is one of the best add clear wpns in game. 
---
If you get above 1980, and played/completed  3 games in the current week, you get 120 score added on reset, and get fabled. 
---
If your quest doesn't trigger after you hit fabled, go to setting, then click change profile. Log back in, and bam. Done. 
---
If you quit a game it doesn't count. Quitting DOES NOT effect your weekly bonus so long as you COMPLETE 3 games. ( example: you disconnect from 2 games but complete 69)
---
Revokers quest ONLY counts score gained, NOT fabled. If you lose 20 games but win 3500 score worth ( what is that? 35 wins ish, without a multiplier?) in between the losses you still get it. 
---
You can cheese the heavy grenade launcher quest by getting a fire team, getting the corrupted strike in the playlist then going to the blind well. 
---
Redrix requires 5 resets on any 1 season.  DO THIS ON IRON BANNER WEEK, especially iron banner weekend during 3x experience, if you also play comp, you don't lose your quickplay streak on losses. 
---
Happy hunting. Stop asking these questions you beautiful blueberries. =)
---
( i edit this and add to it each time somebody mentions what i missed.  Feel free to let me know if i missed something )
---
( "should i come back to d2 copy and paste. ")
---
Yes. Destiny 2 is amazing and in the best state a destiny game hss been in. I dare say its better than D1 at this point. There are more milestones/powerful gear than many players can do in a week ( multiplied by 3.) , 6 raids, gambit prime, tons of weapons from past seasons, tons of exotic quests and much more.
---
Forsaken fixed the year 1 content drought by dumping a ton of content, and each season since did nothing but help. Its seasons brought us forges where we can craft certain weapons, dungeons with amazing exotic quests to em, the menagerie which is basically a mini raid with matchmaking, and even a quest line about the drifter and the nine 
---
Now Shadowkeep is here and with it another HUGE dump of content, the return of eris morn and the moon patrol zone which is larger than ever, 3+ new strikes, new maps ( gambit &amp; crucible. ), EVEN MORE  weapons and exotics, as well as more story and such taking place after the death of ( Redacted. )
---
A new armor system is here that lets you BUILD your perk set instead of praying to RNG. A new telic is here to help you level, perk out and get better
---
D2  couldn't be in much of a better place ( besides needing some minor crucible tweaks. )
---
Also, if you quit because of ( Mida multitool, Lunas/Not forgotten, Prometheus lense, etc.) Being VICIOUSLY busted/OP,GOOD NEWS EVERYONE, they've beem generously nerfed down to reasonable instead of busted. 
---
So all in all, coming from a D1 alpha/Beta player who has stuck to this franchise like cancer to radiation, i dont think the franchise has ever been better.  The only minor complaint is, whilst d2s raids are great, they are a bit more soft, unlike the brutal dark raids of D1 ( Kings Fall. ). But, don't worry, we are still slaughtering oryx's family, because all of them have a bad case of not knowing their place.  ( ehem. Under my boot. ) 
---
As a traitor would say...
---
Come back to destiny, yesss? Or, you diee.....
---
( rating 9.5/10. )
---
Definitely a fun weapon. Managed to get one with grave robber and one-two punch.
---
I mean you cant really expect anything for free
---
Sounds like maybe you used to farm public events for exotics? I used to do that as well lol. That got nerfed so they weren’t so common. I would just grind all the activities and quests for the powerful gear. I’ve gotten quite a few prime engrams while doing those activities as well.
---
Wryyyyyyy
---
Interesting. I hope this isn't an issue with my ps4 then.
---
Welp, shit......I probably could've saved all those random fireteams an aneurysm if I would have known this in 2017 while grinding for Duty Bound.  
---
I've probably been responsible for hundreds of deaths, both in game and real life.
---
Suicide on spawn
---
Time for a fucking crusade
---
You could also pay them for the game to play the endgame
---
And Kurt Cobain shotgunned Also Kurt Cobain
---
Really I often find myself imagining a universe were any of the vanguard are useful aside from Cayde R.I.P our exo friend
---
Who cares if he paid for it or not? If he likes it, he likes it. Regardless of the perks on the ghost or not, people don’t have to appease others with their own decisions for themselves.
---
Love the joke OP, keep on being you!
---
Thank you, i take note !
---
No need to apologize, dude. I was the one in the wrong. Thanks for the clarification though :]
---
Or the fools in EP who don't shoot crystals even though you show yourself destroying one for them...
---
I just leave.
---
Did you finish the machine gun frame?
---
Its so entertaining watching them try to make it through a strike with blackout on. Best time all day
---
Pinnacle weapons made me love pvp
---
I’m no expert on PvP but there are plenty of weapons available without expansions that should help you to hold your own.
---
This is what your Mom was telling you about. Should’ve eaten it, now it’s coming back to haunt you.
---
Oh dman what's that titan helmet
---
[removed]
---
Saved for when I’m sober!
---
The phrase was buried the moment they announced we were going to the moon.
---
Nah we won the game
---
Just do all the campaigns and by then you will have a better understanding of the game and may have a better idea of what to do.
---

Next to rahool at the tower

Imagine if boss fights could be ended by the boss making a player mistake
---
[It's 12:20 AM and I can't stop laughing at this twitter](https://imgur.com/Mn20uJj.jpg)
---
Haven't even touched the moon yet. Wanna play Forsaken first for the sake of continuity.
---
Do not give a shit what anyone says. You do you, if you're the reason for the wipe, who cares.. you learn from it. What kind of a shitty person tells someone that just because of a game.. man. So yeah keep your head up and dont take their shit.
---
Eyes up guardian!
---
Asking for a friend...is that ricochet perk actually a good way to proc riskrunner perk?
---
Random drop when opening engrams or purchase from the gunsmith.
---
Do one event, then go to do another event, by the time you finished with second one vex will spawn at first. Rinse and repeat.
---
Don’t forget the pinnacle rewards!
---
Ohh ok
---
Yeh Jesus I’m not even at 30 yet
---
Congrats tho
---
Is that the MAX POWER?
---
One swing of the blade and say good bye to 25% of the traveler's threats
---
Nope
---
Check all those icons on your Tower map
---
At least take a nap. Lol.
---
Not gonna change, it’s a reality
---
I’ve ran the mission 3 times now and still haven’t gotten it. Are there any other requirements? I think it might just be bugged for me
---
Yeah... There was this titan named “Moon” in the crucible. Have fun buddy.
---
me too buddy... me too... I’ve always ran lowest possible settings and still struggled around 30-40FPS range but now 20FPS is my average :*(
---
The annual pass is included in New Light
---
Got any more cool tricks!
---
Holy shit this is gold.
---
2 blues
---
Random drops, you could get an exotic
---
That sucks. Last week I did them memory/mission and I didn’t pick up anything before hand so I think it was basically a waste.
---
okay but where does this image come from? ive seen it so many times and i want to know the story behind it
---
Oh ok. Sorry .
---
Uh oh, stinky
---
why in the fuck your guardian looks so good? my guardian without helmet looks uglier than Gaul's ass LMAO
---
Yo don't hurt my boi Revoker, he's a good boi I promise... he just a little misunderstood
---
Ohh... *P.O.O.P.!*
---
Yeah you can keep stuff you like and infuse stuff into it later. You don't necessarily have to infuse it the moment you get something higher though. That can kinda run through the upgrade modules.
---
F
---
Indeed. I'm familiar with the last wish raid, having done a few things with friends involving codes and free stuff(look it up), but this chests thing eludes me.
---
I played COS/Warmind at release in Thailand and had no problems.
---
Well what did you expect? We just got a surge of Kinderguardians.
---
Actually how? I’ve already cranked out 65+ hours since last week tuesday and I don’t even have my main maxed out after finishing most weeklies.
---
Hey mate holla if you need a guardian on pc!
---
I’m like brand new to the game, played for 3 days but I’ve put 23 hours in already and kinda have a general understanding. Can anyone point me towards how to get this stuff? I’m in love with the game because of the swords lol
---
Are you looking for an apology? I apologize. I don't mind. 
---
However if this is really your concern, I reserve friendly hand shakes and warm welcomes for those who interact with humans, face to face. The internet is a place for social-derelicts to make themselves feel like they have power. Playing nice online only opens the door for those trolls to get their "fix". I'm not that guy.
---
“What do we do if someone asks for their steak well done dad?” 
---
“We ask the politely but firmly to leave”
---
No it’s from dragonball
---
He’s just standing there
---
MENACINGLY
---
Lol damn you got to it before I did 😂
---
We don’t know when it even if it’ll be available for bright dust. The One Eyed Mask ornament from last season was never purchasable for dust.
---
Nightfall with arc burn was a brutal experience.
---
It will not will only fill do the default mag not the overflow size mag same thing with delirium
---
It’s not a meme it’s an actual problem that can ruin a pretty fun pvp experience.
---
Exotics are account wide. It probably won't drop twice since it might be a "Powerful Drop" from the Quest, to prevent people from farming levels to quickly.
---
Just to go your Collections Tab, and you'll find it there under Exotics &gt; Energy
---
Really like the one I had drop for me. Mine was Spike/Threat Detector/Ambitious Assassin and it melts. I think I’m gonna try for a different roll now though.
---
I understand a slap on the wrist for a pro going out of their way to make a statement, but a perma ban for him, the two shoutcasters, *and* taking away the prize money was a bit overkill. Blizzard blew it way out of proportion and everyone caught wind of it. If they quietly just gave him the money and a soft ban saying “hey we don’t do that here. Do it again and you’re permabanned” then no one would have bothered paying attention.
---
People 
---
Order 
---
Our
---
Patties
---
Oh I thought you meant you got everything done between Foresaken and black armoury
---
Not sure you can call that build your own lol maybe the mobility part. I've done the same but recovery instead of mobility. There's alot of Warlocks running this build. You don't need graviton lance either. Any void weapons will do.
---
Nice
---
If you finish the dungeon and go the puzzle, you can do it in 3 weeks instead of 5. However, not too long ago I came across a guy who claimed a friend of his got over 50% from doing one run including the puzzle.
---
It's a tertiary source so it's not very reliable, for now I'd assume it's still 3 weeks with the puzzle or 5 without.
---
Im playing right now, it seems to be fixed maybe see if you can update ur destiny 2
---
Question: Are the seasonal mods one time use? 
---
Like, if I put them in one of my weapons/armor, will I have to reacquire them again to br able to put them in another equipment?
---
Would be super cool if Finishers involved the sword
---
It was not a perma ban. He was banned for a year  only from Hearthstone tournaments as far as I know. And two casters fired.
---
no
---
Never once, have I been disappointed by this community
---
Probably my favorite line. That or when hank discovers Bobby and Peggy using charcoal and he draws all the blinds and talks to them at the kitchen table, comedy gold.
---
https://youtu.be/WQdV2DOsazo
---
This is one of my favorite videos showing how ridiculous speed can get in d2 (Titan skating was patched and this is on pc). Also not my video just find it cool
---
I think this is mainly aimed at more experienced players.
---
Xol was presumably remade as Whisper of the Worm and feeds off of our kills with the weapon to sharpen his sword logic, since we don’t practice it ourselves. 
---
The Dreadnaught was carved using parts of Akka’s corpse and is not sentient/alive(?) by means of sword logic, unlike Xol. 
---
It’s similar to Oryx and the Touch of Malice; they both had a contingency plan in the event that they were bested, and now feed (well, for Oryx feed*ed*) off of our kills since again we don’t really follow the sword logic ourselves — opener of vacancies, as Toland says. 
---
Though now that I think about it, I think Touch of Malice was just Oryx trying to live on past a true death, since he is very much dead. Xol is more debatable but probably not.
---
Doesn't bother me any. I got a meh roll the first time I got this rifle and still enjoyed it.
---
For boss damage you can go with a grenade launcher with spike grenades and aggressive frame for a heavy weapon. Such grenade launcher includes outrageous fortune (vanguard engrams), swarm of the raven (iron banner), and love and death (essence of insanity).
---
not sure what you mean by overlay? nothing to my knowledge at least...?
---
I’ve done something similar, but with grenades.  I can get my grenade back every 5-10 seconds usually.
---
Gonna do my best.
---
Moons haunted
---
I think so! That's the one where Failsafe's captain is inside a Harpy and it tells you to follow it, right? Or something like that.
---
I'd like to think they're related. It would be a fun thing to tell Failsafe.
---
Do the bounties for Spider on Tangled Shore, they pay really well.
---
This also works for Stormtrance.
---
Fuck him dude. Would prefer you on your worst days over this dude on his best day. Most healthy people would. Remember that my man
---
At least you guys still have your own check point so you can continue right where you left off! Sucks what happened but soldier on
---
#ITS FINE IF YOU DON’T BREATHE
---
I'll have to try that. It was pretty good before Shadowkeep but now with the buffs to scouts it should be even better.
---
You assumed and he answered idk why you’re getting all salty about it
---
Like something placed over your game. For example in Discord you can enable it to see who is talking while in game.
---
thats why i skipped out on the thorn so far.
---
i got the chaperone and the last word and the malfesance but the thorn made me quit
---
ah yeah, nope... no discord overlay (dont think its even supported lol) and nothing of that sort whatsoever... my computer apparently just doesnt like shadowkeep. It worked perfectly fine before shadowkeep's launch and i could play it comfortably for hours and hours
---
Goddamn hunter mains
---
Jheez
---
No problem. Have fun with the game
---
wish they showed more and maybe had an end to the curse.. instead of right now just killing it off
---
It does it to me aswell I thought it would have been fixed in the last update
---
The PvP team are a bunch of clowns for adding that step in(or whoever did it). Death impeding progress is so stupid. 
---
My friend isn’t very good at PvP, so I did that step for him. I got it done in like 3 games, but it’s seriously not fair at all for pve weapons to have crucible quest steps. 
---
Maybe when crucible is good, but it sucks ass and doesn’t feel rewarding in the slightest to play it so it isn’t fun at all.
---
Bruh this is the curated roll right? Hold onto this shotgun holy shit.
---
Well, that explains expansion 1 and 2 unavailable but forsaken is just an overview in the store right now i cant buy it
---
Have you tried checking your game files with steam?
---
The place we now teleport to isn't actually called "The Tower". Last I checked, The Tower is still overrun with Fallen.
---
🤷‍♂️
---
My msi works fine but still, heers your F

You hate to see it. Hope he got banned.
---
I use my boyfriend as a meat shield because I'm always gonna be a kinderguardian due to how infrequently I play. It's still my favorite game though
---
*anxious screaming*
---
If you play 1 hour a day, maybe...
---
This can be done much faster than that dude.
---
If you need to buy forsaken to get the new supers for each class and ace of spades I’d totally do it
---
Go to xur and but em. Stop being upset about not getting a handout
---
Thanks I found a guide and memorised most of them but that helps for when I forget. Which I will
---
How
---
I usually avoid pvp in most mmo’s because it’s often gear/stat based, but the pvp in D2 reminds me of the good ole days of halo 3, but not as wacky as halo 2. I of course avoid death match as I know I’d get rekt and stick to the domination type game.
---
Yeah I finished mines in 3 days but I was assuming  he/she was a casual player
---
Fuck you you just spoiled for me
---
Hey you guys have seen me about
---
I am loving it, i am sad that I did not start the game earlier. There is so much to do / farm, I am a POE/Diablo player so grinding is a second job for me hahaha
---
But Xbox give me a smack on the hand and forcefully change my gamertag from alienslxt to some bullshit I have to pay to change 😭

It can take me a solid 5-10 minutes of loading in to the Tower, walking around and picking up bounties, and then heading to the planet I want to go to. That's 10 minutes I have to spend doing busybody work instead of fucking playing.
---
If we play everyday like Bungie want us to that's over an hour a week doing bullshit busybody work. Every year I can waste over 2 weeks doing this shit if I were to play every year. Just one day is too fucking much.
---
It's not just Bungie either. Every fucking video game studio has at least one garbage feature designed to do nothing but waste the players time, as if my fucking time on this god-forsaken fucking planet isn't limited enough as it is.
---
Just because you're a low-paying dev forced to work 80 hours a fucking week for some rich corporate slack-off doesn't mean I don't have some damn respect for my fucking time.
---
They just want an Austringer, not a fully upgraded Chalice. 😏
---
What system are you playing on? Ps4 go to settings and account, xbox I think is under settings and billing, pc check under steam account
---
Well I hope you’ll find a new home here!
---
Yeh I’m stuck on an almost endless loop of grinding for prime engrams to jump one power per engram
---
I wouldn’t mind getting the raid. Once I find friends to do them with lol
---
No, they just fuck it up.
---
To roll for Austringer, you're going to need green runes. So, you're going to need to unlock, at the very least, Rune Slot 1 and 2 and Rune Compatibility 2 (bottom-left row). Granted, this will not allow you to choose your Masterwork for the weapon. For that, you will need to unlock the third rune slot.
---
However, to do that all of that faster, you'll need Power and Efficiency 2. P&amp;E 1 will allow you to open the chests on the Barge each week for Imperials, and P&amp;E 2 will net you random Imperial drops for completing activities like strikes, crucible matches, etc. It's worth investing in these first, or else it will take weeks to get up enough runes to unlock what you need.
---
Oh wow! New supers? And what’s ace of spades? I still remember getting new supers in D1 and it was like a whole new game
---
Yeah in one of his comments he asked how long to upgrade chalice 🤭
---
Your titan might have bugged out, worst case if it doesn't fix itself by logging in and out you'll have to remake the titan
---
I mean look at the brightside. A kill and medal stack so technically its more like 7000. Plus streaks and shutdowns and other game mode based medals itll go quicker then you think
---
i try kill them before they kill me. see an overshield, run, hide and wait it out. most of the time patience pays off.
---
...until he’s able to get Austringer. 😉
---
But you’re right. A few days ought to get it done.
---
&gt;14000 kills/medals is ridiculous.
---
It isn't 14k medals. It's 14k points. Multikills and higher medals give more points.
---
I would never say that's a sparrow, it looks like a weapon for me.
---
It’s the low light level with the beginning gear, I think
---
Good
---
I'm in the same position as you, got bored of Black armory last season now both jotunn and izanagis burden need 10 BA gun forges. So I guess I'll have it in November.
---
Get your scout kills first. Then switch tl.skmethimg you can reliably get double kill or higher on. Does not have to be scout multikills
---
Guardians battle Horrors on the Moon but yeah a blow torch is what'll get them.
---
My concern is why they're not just using some robots to do it ?
---
Shit, even a Ghost could do it !
---
I hope they dont change this! This is going to be so much fun :D
---
The new supers are included in shadowkeep, Ace of Spades is a handcannon with a buffed version or Dragonfly and Killclip called Firefly and Memento Mori respectively.
---
I will always recommend buying Forsaken, The Last Wish raid is amazing and Scourge of the Past and Crown of Sorrows are really good as well and if raiding is not your thing the exotic armor pieces and weapons are very nice
---
oh shit here we go again
---
Thanks dude
---
I don't think it's the meta. Scouts is Still in kind of a bad spot. But people use them to get randys. But they are fun.
---
Using jade rabbit and recluse right now, so fucking fun!
---
Meh, poop.
---
It would make a lot more sense if it was diarrhea. That's a nightmare to be afraid of.
---
Unless you're really that desesperate, I don't see any need for that
---
Everyone can
---
Nope. Either $35, $60 or wait for it to be free.
---
Disnt know this, thanks!
---
Recluse is busted and it’s probably not gonna get nerfed, and it kinda makes it so there’s only a single secondary people use and it’s recluse
---
It's not completely free to play.
---
Hmm, the quest didn’t require me to place a beacon, and yes, I have talked to Eris. But I’ll check out the area the quest takes place and look for a beacon area.
---
Joining a clan helps immensely. Finding a good clan isn’t easy, but worth the time and effort. You may have to join (and leave) several before you find a group you like. I certainly did. The problem with randoms in chat is that we often end up with some very young kid who won’t stop screaming into the mic, or we get some complete douche who is an ass the entire time. I’d rather play in silence than deal with either.
---
The base game is free to play isnt it?
---
RuneScape didn’t think anyone would max out an account either, they underestimate gamers ability to no life lol
---
the cramped room kinda sucked but it wasn’t anything way too bad. her scream though was ear rupturing
---
Tfw I’ve wanted a primary Sword/Shield since Rise of Iron. 
---
I just want to **_DEUS VULT_** all over the enemies of The Light, is that so wrong?
---
Oh okay, thanks
---
Ouch. With the new system though it shouldn't take you more than a couple of hours. Got mine last night
---
Find a friend and Gameshare.
---
Babe: "Babe come over"
---
Me: "Can't Moons haunted"
---
Babe: "I know how to get easy raid loot without raiding"
---
Me: ^
---
In a span of 2 weeks, yes
---
I did 2 legendary bow (spiteful fang) and it only counts as 1
---
Please tell me the clan's name is something with d*cks in it
---
*distant polka*
---
She sacrificed for you to make that shot.
---
Biggest crutch in destiny history, let the downvotes pour in clowns.
---
This is hilarious because my dad works in the dairy industry and a guy a work with (much older than me) always says he woulda been my daddy but the milkman beat him to it.
---
I'm pretty sure Vex Offensive is season pass only.
---
Nice oem🤡
---
It’s so stupid, bungie just never learns..
---
Considering I'm the milk man... You wouldnt happen to be named Daniel would you?
---
I’m not lol
---
You're confusing two different situations with each other. Bungie is 100% owned by only bungie and while they have an chinese investor, the stakes are different to those of blizzard as blizzard games are owned to 5% by Tecent as well as most of their revenue coming from china.
---
Bungie is a lot smaller in there, having only recently started expanding within it and gaining most of their playerbase from USA/EU.
---
Looks more like a weapon of marrow amirite? :D
---
Now the game needs a segway sparrow.
---
M Y S T E R Y
---
It’s not bad, it’s just that there are better hand cannons to use now that might outclass it
---
#DISGUSTANG
---
Surprisingly it's a huge multi clan full of funny people. No dick or ball references in the actual name, but plenty of memers in the clan itself.
---
Interesting, I tried doing it and the message said that members of the fireteam do not have access to this activity. Have you done this?
---
DM me your username and I'll add ya!
---
I am on PC
---
Not even the right part guys cmon
---
They already were in the loot table, you just had to finish a legendary frame to get a chance of getting it. I dont really like that they are quests now
---
Bwahahaha. This is what every poor ass PC owner says. Sorry bud, just because Linus can search and build a comparable PC that looks like shit, doesn't mean you can. PC flexing just shows what a douche bag you are. Still have yet to meet someone playing on console who DOESN'T own a PC also. Not to mention your PC build is probably 3 times the cost of a console, and half the graphics. lol
---
I own every console and a laptop that's probably more powerful than your PC. But telling you would be a douchebag move. So I won't. Pathetic.
---
Whats with the hazard of the cast? 
---
Farming for breakneck?
---
Wasn't flexing at all?
---
Simply came across these two, found their names funny, decided to post my findings.
---
I guess she must be quite vexing
---
Ah I see, I misunderstood his question
---
Welllll... r/braincels exists. It's quarantined for a good reason.
---
Team are of equal size. So the amount of people who win and lose is pretty equal. Competition also pushes people to be their best.
---
Thanks, china
---
Nailed it.
---
Then you turn herioc, best damn feeling
---
Ooh i remember that! I also remember the glitch were you took the sword after the first part and went up on one of the towers to sword fly over to the other side.
---
Don't be to use it to win at all. I got to 3500 without it the Friday before the raid dropped. You're not losing in comp because other players are using OEM.
---
Even during my weeklies I seem to still get that set...
---
Id say PS4: TV, i wouldn't want to play the game on a small monitor.
---
This just seems fun
---
First person to play as raiden must have been like
---
*Immigrant Song plays in the distance*
---
Once you get to 900, the main way to get any item above 900 is through obtaining prime or powerful engrams. The amount of higher light you get is dependent on the tier of engram. It can go to any slot, but the amount of light you get tends to rely more on your overall light and not the light of one item. If you have one piece of gear that’s holding you back, you’ll start seeing blues give you light over 900 to help you catch that piece up.
---
No, a bottleneck is where one either your gpu or cpu can't keep up with the other. You have a very slow cpu and gpu. Their 960 is faster than your 1050 2gb.  
---
Also you didn't mention what settings you're trying to run at.
---
But in the end you literally have the minimum requirements to play the game. If you have the funds to upgrade I'd recommend starting with your gpu, but a full system is probably needed. If you're budget minded and skip looks/flash, you can build a pretty powerful system on lower end new gen or higher end last gen gear for well under a $1,000 that'll shred 1080p well over 60fps.
---
you should see the clip in my new post :^ )
---
Congrats! Hoe many times did y'all wipe?
---
I meant as in, they're quests now. But if for some reason Bungie removed Forges (hindering quest), they would then most likely add both exotics to normal exotic loot table (un-forge related)
---
Just a tip if they haven't patched it yet. If you do Reckoning Tier 1 on your Warlock it currently will drop Titan gear at your Warlocks light level.
---
I don't have an RTX graphics card, I have a GTX1060 6GB.
---
I played 5 matches and the only one I lost had 2 oem striker titans on the opposing team, what can I do in a small map when I get into a 1v2 against shielded titans?
---
Yes yes, i know what you meant
---
Alright so let's say a normal activity grants me a armor piece with 12 Mobility; What would a pinnacle activity award me assuming I get a high roll on Mobility?
---
Thanks man! Well the only quest step that I had to complete was reaching fabled all the previous were completed before shadowkeep so I felt the grind, believe me.
---
Nah pc
---
THE GOGGLES! THEY DO NOTHING!
---
Legit though, I wonder if we’ll ever go inside the traveler. I’m sure there’s rule 34 of it but I want to know wtf is going on inside it
---
Lol that's only what i ask people in game that just randomly say they're a veteran. I have had conversations going like this 
---
Random guy "hi is there still a place for me?"
---
Me "There's 1 more place but are you experienced with the nightfall?"
---
Random guy "I'm a D1 veteran i think i'll do even better than you"
---
Me "Oh cool, what was the best weapon in D1?
---
Random guy "hmm let me think *intense typing*
---
15 seconds later "gjallahorn of course"
---
The truth is there is no right answer, all that matters is how fast you say a good exotic from D1 and how they behave.
---
Iirc, I remember seeing a post about it the other day. I'll see if I can find it.
---
supposedly there's skill based mm involved now but not sure why they think you're on the same level
---
The one time I got one to spawn I killed six groups of hydras. Two would spawn when the gatelord was only slightly damaged and three more when he was almost dead.
---
Solo comp is always a toss. Last season (likely my last playing comp, ever) I played 43 matches and was still at 0 points because I would win one or two, then it would just be a set of 10+ matches of losses straight through.
---
Not sure how it works with the new solo comp thing they have going, but from the way you're describing it, it just matches teams on relative rank, so if the other team has one person who's notably higher than you, you can safely assume that they, and the rest of their team, are probably more mechanically and tactically skilled than you, and probably your team mates.
---
I guess just start practicing and try doing some other things like calling out what you're going to do, to yourself, that way you can work on what you're doing in-game and develope better on-the-fly decision skills.
---
Ok thx
---
That strike is much creepier when you realize that Taeko-3's voice is actually Savathun baiting you.
---
Not whooshing at all, I had no idea :-)  I have a steam account, but very rarely play on PC... I did not know that steam names were not unique, and honestly, I had no idea this was even a PC account, I thought someone managed to snag the gamertag : PooP on Xbox :-)
---
Thanks for the clarification!
---
Most likely next season
---
Yea
---
Update: i reached power 926 and only have two powerful engrams remaining.
---
I will not make it to 940 but possibly to 930
---
Ehh....what?  The hive would have been immune due to ~~plot armor~~ sword-logic magic without her sacrifice.
---
Wish this would happen when the overlord is there  😔
---
*Spoopy ambiance* Oryx, the Taken King. You killed his son, now, he comes for vengeance.
---
Oh ok thats a little bad tbh like i really grinded for it so thats unfortinate
---
Ah, wonderful. I didn't play much during season of the drifter and don't really have any idea about what they changed about Gambit, but I'll check it out. Thanks!
---
Where can I sign up!
---
Crunchy, yummy gardians.
---
Quest pain and gain. Follow that one. It's pretty easy. Leads you to both gun and catalyst
---
Even the ghost cheats and removes all the pieces.
---
That is an amazing animation
---
then you must be the luckiest person on earth
---
I don't know if cheats in PvE exist. But check Esoterikk on YT. He is doing very hard activities Solo. We just need to get gud :) (If only i had so much time on my hands :D )
---
I'd rather go inside Ada-1 or the Exo Stranger.
---
Good intentions, yes, poor execution, though.  That's the wrong forum for that.  I agree with Blizz that he shouldn't have abused the live stream in the way he did.
---
Upgrades.
---
after over one 1000 hours and this being the only game i play i still learn a lot of new shit
---
Why is this not a thing?
---
  THATS RIGHT BABY! ALL POINT, NO QUILLS, NO PILLOWS. LOOK AT THIS, IT LOOKS LIKE TWO BALLS AND A BONG. HE FUCKED MY WIFE SO GUESS WHAT? I'M GONNA FUCK THE EARTH. THAT'S RIGHT! THAT'S WHAT YOU GET! MY SUPER LASER PISS! EXCEPT I'M NOT GONNA PISS ON THE EARTH. I'M GONNA GO HIGHER, I'M GONNA PISS ON THE MOON!
---
\*BOOM\*
---
HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT OBAMA? I PISSED ON THE MOON YOU IDIOT! YOU HAVE 23 HOURS BEFORE THE PISS DROPLETS HIT THE EARTH NOW GET OUT OF MY FUCKING SIGHT BEFORE I PISS ON YOU TOO!
---
Why did they do that?
---
If you're on console it's still really good because of the recoil and consistency. If you're on PC there's probably better options.
---
It looks like a 416.
---
I really like Trust on console, and as far as I know you can get it as a New Light player. Not sure if there's better options on PC.
---
Here, you need this

A guy I know is called Registered Vex Offender.
---
You win like 200+ assuming you’re not on a win streak, but lose like 40 or less.
---
zero.  Recorded the clip on my one and only run on this strike this week. I have always used the Cylinder to block the shreikers....and may strategically allow my teammates to round the corner first...heh.
---
all 3 gatelords, i have had the overlord spawn both when i killed every hydra and when i have not touched a single hydra and just melted the gatelord
---
Ooooh now that I think of it I've always only put my armor to level 5 cause I'm a cheapskate and dont want to spend the shards to upgrade. I'm stupid I appreciate it.
---
My actual username is Quasla, I thought it would count the name changes as being searchable names
---
You can get either very lucky or grind out a shit load of masterwork cores and get Masterwork Prisms and Ascendant shards from Banshee-44 or a raid/pinnacle activity either way people will have spent quite a long time getting enough shards.
---
Just a reminder that only 1 shard per armour is needed
---
And about 5 master work cores
---
Don’t know about prisms if someone can check that would be nice.
---
I think Bungie said that you had to have the mods in your inventory for them to be converted over
---
nice
---
what platform do you play games on because if you want the games free we could play together
---
Does he T-bag their juice box?
---
Damn didn't notice! Thanks
---
İt was an emote you got for silver as part of a package which you got for a discounted price if you brought the grimoire anthology volume 2. Then it became a bright dust purchase about a month after that for one week.
---
Yea i am on console and its a really good hand cannon but i used last word so with the range nerf it falls short to the last word tbh as its range isn't good now
---
You pay to change your name in Xbox lmao $9 or smth like that
---
[deleted]
---
If you expect to become a god in gambit in 10ish attempts, you're in for a load of disappoitment.
---
Learn the maps, understand the mechanics, find yourself weapons that compliment your style of play and you'll find yourself enjoying it more.
---
Alternatively, if it's not something you actually enjoy... play something else.
---
Same for me.
---
Same here!
---
Buy both to assert dominance😤😤😤😤😤😤
---
The game is free you should give it a try. 
---
Also why did you pick that name
---
Wow people still say get good that’s so yesteryear
---
By supporting an anti-imperialist country?
---
If you have the forsaken / annual pass, Spare Rations and Kindled Orchid (reckoning / forges) are both pretty good. Ace of Spades is also a great option, although it takes up your exotic slot.
---
Damn, nice. I'll definitely save this and send it to people to help spread the info. Way easier than trying to explain it.
---
Hey guys, just got a bygones role with: hammerforged rifling, high impact rounds, range finder and headsesker with a range masterwork. Would this be considered a god roll? Is there a better roll I shoul look out for? Any info would be great, thanks!
---
Yep it’s been like that on Xbox forever, first name change is free and then it’s like $10 or $15 to do it afterwards. I guess they know they can get away with snagging a little bit like that from casuals.
---
&gt; You often finish yourself
---
You know me too well. 
---
https://i.imgur.com/xFWJpaZ.jpg
---
I second that. It’s a yes from me. Let’s go to the other judges...
---
My titan is 669
---
Doubt. I think it’s just leftover from the previous Quests page, which displayed 3 pages of 7 rows of 3 items, 63 total.
---
Get out
---
I achieved rank 50 by now, just by playing the content I actually WANT to play and just taking bounties with me left and right. Way more fun this way imo.
---
1.) Oh shit, gold for reposting a picture I didn't make, WOOO
---
2.) I printed that out and hung it next to my monitor for quick reference.  That was how I learned how to do the things.
---
Unfortunately F2P only gets access to certain parts. If you want the full game, pay up.
---
As long as its the moon strike im good with it, if its pre shadowkeep strikes it should be f2p
---
That’s a third yes from me dawg
---
Absolutely, they’ve given everyone plenty of free content. If you want to play more then you should buy in and support the company.
---
Would someone like Jotaro be overpowered in the Destiny Universe?
---
Nightfall is a harder strike. You have the strikes for free on F2P. And a lot of other free activities to see if you enjoy the game and are willing to invest money in it if you're going to spend hours playing. 
---
IMO they were very generous with the free content.
---
Yup
---
You dont have to infuse them. Another good way to get around the elemental restrictions is to use hard light or just keep 1 weapon of each element on you at all times.
---
Yea spider sells glimmer for planetary mats or shards occasionally
---
Sooo... splut?
---
Oh lawd, he is comin
---
You can play the campaigns in any order you want to, but here is the release order:
---
1. Red War
---
2. Curse of Osiris
---
3. Warmind
---
4. Forsaken
---
Really powerful weapons or armour. They have a specific perk that adds a new ability or increases the effectiveness of an existing one. For example: the  celestial knight hawk  hunter exotic mask means when you use golden gun you have one super shot instead of 3. You can also only equip one exotic weapon and one exotic armour piece at a time.
---
I still get killed by the trains lmao
---
It's a shadow keep strike so, yes it is fair.
---
Nice to see someone use the pikes!
---
Plot twist: the pyramid gets rolled into another sphere. And thus night man becomes day man.
---
Guys I would like to thank you for all the support I have been getting, it means so much to me. You have no idea.
---
A guardian is never truly alone is he.
---
New light. Red war can be started by talking to Amanda in the hanger
---
While I understand that Bungie has been very generous, I feel being locked out of rewards for the week isn’t fair, not the content itself. Couldn’t players without Shadowkeep get an alternative nightfall strike?
---
I’m down for not having the strike itself available, that’s fair. Just not the reward lock out because of it.
---
And you need to pay a yearly subscription just to have online features for consoles? Jesus
---
Just to clarify on the one super shot... It does the damage of 6 golden gun bullets.
---
i got rid of all my barryon boyos last night for dem shards
---
Didn't that quest get removed?
---
I would consider myself a destiny 1 veteran I'm going try playing destiny 2 again and see if It interest me or I just delete it
---
Yeah but didn’t we kill a spicy hive knight in the prison of elders in D1?
---
I didn’t even read the post but yes
---
Fourth
---
Yea I get you. I even have a warlock mug which makes switching mains to a different class even harder
---
Yes
---
Yea, I love Coldheart and I'm getting Wavesplitter tomorrow from Xur. Can't wait to get the new trace as soon as I can get the time to do the raid part... but not having scavenger for them is a bummer. Personally I'd also like to see a Legendary Trace Rifle someday.
---
I'd buy it with your silver too!
---
Where did you find it?
---
There was a [Pepsi game](https://youtu.be/DKHPxpNZ8_s) as well lol, I played this when I was a kid
---
I mean that’s 2 powerful you’d miss out on, that’s not that bad because there’s still 10~ other drops you can get from every other activity milestones. That and it’s only like 2 strikes out of the 15 total that would lock f2p players out of the nightfall so that’s not bad either.
---
Or you could buy the game
---
Yep. Get your wallet out cheap ass.
---
Yep
---
Well hopefully they take the Epic Games path
---
Oh god oh fuck
---
You can. Just not ordeal.
---
How do you access the collections tab?
---
Did you deconstructed the exotic weapons as well? And how do you know you have 2.0 version of the exotics?
---
K thank you
---
Ya I finished both already, but thanks though.
---
Oh haha for me it still says 12 days
---
Okay, maybe it was just coincidence then that the loot I had gotten from my second character was slightly an upgrade (aka my primary is slightly lower than the engram levels, and I just happened to have received a new primary).
---
You gotta pay the troll toll...
---
SEISMIC YEEEEEEET
---
and eventually, she stopped thinking
---
I have 250k Glimmer and I cant get more, Its impossible to spend them on bounties faster than we get glimmer back. How is that called a currency? Where can I spend that stuff to not waste it to the cap all the time?
---
Or to build a birdhouse in your soul.
---
While they may not give powerful gear to raise your level, the Menagerie is one of the best ways to farm good rolls on a wide variety of specific weapons and armor.
---
Halfdan-D aint bad, especially if you can land consistent crits. It only drops from the gunsmith though. Also I think Cammycakes even made a video on it, so I guess that does confirm its viability to some extent
---
Old raids only give gear up to the soft cap of 900, so kind of only for cool looking armor. 
---
Forsaken will give you access to tangled shore activities and dreaming coty activities like the last wish raid and the story. 
---
Forsaken annual pass(idk if they're separate or not) gives you black armory, jokers wild, and opulence content. 
---
Shadowkeep currently gives access to vex offensive, nightmare hunts, and the Garden of Salvation raid, not all of shadowkeep is released yet though, 2 more exotic quests are coming as well as a new dungeon.
---
Shadowkeep season pass gives access to the 4 seasons coming after shadowkeep
---
Warlock here so not really.
---
Really? There are alway a ton of people around eris, but all the public events and vex invasions I never see other people. Maybe 1 other person will be their but thats it. Then you go to earth and there are 6 people at every event.
---
"Lover of the russian queen"
---
Oh damn I did not know that, thanks for the heads up!
---
If we wanna get into that's boys hole? Erm. Boys soul. BOYS SOUL.
---
Oh god yes. The last raid released?
---
Congratulations, I have yet to do a raid but I’ve joined a clan that can hopefully help
---
Apparently this was happening when my friends looked at my name too. I dunno what the cause of it is though
---
Yes, it’s the raid. Garden of Stupidity.
---
working on catalyst for my cerberus+1 on my 920 warlock and trying to get my titan and hunter beyond 918power right now....
---
You need to complete the “introduction” quests from each person. They will say “introduction strikes” “introduction crucible” etc. Once you do that then you will get the weekly 8 bounty thing
---
I view the games storyline as a representation of those shape boxes with the holes. The traveler is the circle hole and I'll be damned if I don't force that triangle through it.
---
Breakneck is kind of mediocre now because of Recluse, i would definately go for loaded question because last season fusions got a massive buff and its a fun gun to use in both pvp and pve.
---
You can craft armour in the collections tab
---
I agree, it felt very rewarding to complete
---
First....go to your armor collection and grab any and all ornaments that are there, that are not in your inventory.  
---
Second, go to details on any legendary armor piece (not just the new seasonal armor) and push down on the Dpad (not sure how to bring up cosmetics on PC, but you can).
---
Third, select the ornament you like for the armor.  
---
Forth, select your shader if any.
---
You can choose different pieces from different armor sets and make them look like they go together with shaders.
---
Ok thanks.
---
Yeah it's kinda hard to say no when it's free
---
Imma be well sad if that's the case, will play at 60 and see if it happens again.
---
should  be a thing  needs to be a thing
---
So I should do everything that says "powerful gear" essentially?
---
Where is this?
---
&gt;Are they old exotics you’ve had in inventory since pre shadowkeep? Idk why exactly but those armor’s stats are very low. Pull a new version out of collections and they will be much higher, but you might not have access to the same perks
---
Yes, they are old exotics before new light. I will try to pull them out of collections.
---
I have that many too. Started playing again since vanilla.
---
Currently playing the Shadowkeep story. Very cool Bungie
---
Now I just picture this guy standing around in public events yelling "NONE SHALL PASS!"
---
Yeah it would be a completely new game. I’d say 20gb at least since d1 was a one disk game
---
Nice repost.
---
This needs to be seen
---
Well clearly Last Word is A PvP weapon and pretty much useless in pve so
---
Uh, i guess, especially in higher difficulty settings.
---
Oh I never knew that about breakneck but I’m not that great at pvp so getting the recluse will be a pain for me but thanks for the advice
---
Hoho you‘re approaching me?
---
The sound of the kills piling up was satisfying.
---
Gotcha, well I'll have to get that mod and put it on then!
---
I think that you can get the Sunshot handcannon without forsaken
---
I have a 66 as well
---
Tried downloading to HDD and it took forever. Switched to SSD and took two hours. Just asking
---
Oh it's a daily rotation for forges now, no unlocking
---
Right on, that makes me feel better. Thanks a bunch!
---
Ahh The Architects.
---
RIP down connection
---
He already said it was the playstyles that are better then yours, which explains why you’re losing. Stop being a sore loser and actually get good at the game you say you already excel in.
---
*Destiny veteran turns head and laughs*
---
First time?
---
What I do to fix it is just to cancel the search and start it again
---
If it is the capacitors it's a cheap fix
---
I actually got a 67 on my warlock the other day, not sure where the hell from.
---
So looking at my map, only one raid currently even gives powerful/pinnacle gear and it's the one on the moon? I don't even know how or where to see raids lol.
---
Laughs in year 1's 200 vault size
---
there is a thirty five dollar version,but  I do know that you can get both forsaken and shadow keep for 60 dollars
---
you...
---
you **DO** know Titans are supposed to be the most aggressive class right? why would we NOT rush?
---
It's a shot gun perk. If you land all pellets your melee does more damage. Titans have a exotic that increase melee damage while airborne. Hunters have a exotic that increase melee an you combo that with top tree arch strider which has it's own melee buff. So you shot an get one two combo goin then melee. So titans is alot easier to pull off an does more damage. I one shot champions in the raid at 930
---
Hmm, I see, maybe I just need a better look at it.
---
The vangaurd ritual weapon gives you a machine gun
---
All you need to translate Australian to English is leave of the word mate,  right.... mate?
---
Thank you I didn’t even know that sub existed
---
Quite a bit longer apparently. Why would you ever challenge two people at once instead of trying to separate them? In survival you have two teammates and 4 backup lives for the team. Outside of you being the last person on your team with no lives left there's never a reason and even then it's best to try to separate them rather than just run at em if they're together. How many times do I have to say it before you understand?
---
Yeah I’ve just dedicated to trying to make every one heroic. I even tried to make the escalation protocol heroic I couldn’t find it on the guide I saved. I looked it up after and realised it was completely different
---
No not Australian I'm from austria
---
21% delirium is a pinnacle weapon you can get from gambit, and it’s the best. Also hammer head from forges, there one from the menagerie as long as you have at least blue runes. The Crown of Sorrow raid has one. Thunder lord the exotic random drops.
---
he ran from the middle of the map to my spawn and had 10 full seconds of ult inside my spawn i dont think he needs mtn or recluse to farm
---
Go get the destiny 2 companion app. It's entirely free and they have a whole forum section strictly for clan recruitment. I use to when I'm recruiting. 
---
Information you'll want to include in your post. 
---
Platform, time zone/location, when you'll be playing, what you want from a clan, what kind of clan youre looking for (casual, hardcore, PvP?),if you're willing to use 3party apps, age preference, your age, and any other information that is deal breaker for you.
---
A lot of clans use discord ,but some clans don't. Just say if you would or won't be willing to get it. 
---
You don't even need to make a post because they have 100s of clans posting all day and night, but I would recommend letting them come to you. When I recruit I look for people reaching out for a clan and give detailed description of what they want to make sure they will fit into the clan. However, there are some massive clans that only care about numbers, so just choose what is best for you!
---
Anyways, good luck and happy hunting!
---
Dw man. Warlocks gotta look out for each other
---
Max glory is a pinnacle too.
---
You should probably use it on lower power levels or just pre 900 light. 900 light is the soft cap so you’ll need powerful rewards to get 950, Pinnacle Rewards for 960.
---
I’ve been playing since dark below and never used that much vault space. What do you put in there?
---
What Gun is that? Im guessing an exotic but I dont know which one?
---
It came from the traveler........ duh. In all seriousness it fell off the bottom during the collapse when it pushed back the darkness.
---
tfw when you get killed by an Arc Staff twice in a row...
---
Is there somewhere that clans post that they’re accepting new members? I don’t have any friends who play D2 but I really want to get into raiding and trying to raid with randoms is a nightmare
---
You can do a weapon frame from Ada 1in the tower to get the Hammerhead. Also, a certain rune combination will allow you to get the Fixed Odds from the Menagerie.
---
You can get one from doing a powerful machine gun frame from black armory or use the right combo for the menagerie. These are easy to get if you need a machine gun
---
You can use upgrade modules to increase the power of your exotics, but you shouldn’t constantly upgrade as they aren’t very cheap. All exotics are unique.
---
I'm a lone Warlock. Don't trust anyone. Fireteams are a means to an end.
---
Unfortunately it's been like 7 years of micro managing spaces. 8( just tired of it and this armor made the situation way worse.
---
The exotic Thunderlord which is a world drop, and the Menagerie are the two ways to get machine guns other than the raids.
---
outbreak perfected.
---
well.....
---
D1
---
Traveler "sacrificed" itself to stop the darkness, many parts broke off.
---
I'm having a hard time choosing  characters and switch between all 3.
---
I made a new character instead ;)
---
Regrinding all the weeklies :D
---
Don’t worry we all are 😏
---
So let's get to stacking bodies, one by one.
---
“Yours. Not mine.”
---
Yes, because the moon raid is the new raid, therefore it will (obviously) be the one giving pinnacle gear. 
---
Y1 raids are located at the bottom of Nessus, and the Y2 raids are located in Dreaming City (Last Wish) and EDZ (Scourge of the Past). Those last 2 are tied to Forsaken DLC
---
Those raids do not give powerful rewards anymore because they are from older content
---
In the belly of the great space whale.
---
Imagine leaving that and knowing you missed the whole fight
---
Sooo I've been doing exactly that and only have 4 upgrade core thingies left. I'm a new player, so I don't have a ton of mats. Is it gonna be shitty for me and gonna have to grind a bunch? The mats aren't too bad, but those orange crystal/shard things I have no idea how to get lol.
---
That is unfortunate, but it does save me time.
---
Usually 1 to 2 God roll of every pvp and pve weapon version.  I exclude some clear stinkers though. That and good combos for armor.
---
Have a shard!😘
---
Thanks for the answer.
---
I like the activity, but it can be repetitive.  Hoping they add new levels and bosses and loot to mix things up.
---
Solar flair is the destiny1 vine compilation right ?
---
no particular sight?
---
Wth you can do that!? I’m new to destiny 2 so idk what they changed from destiny 1
---
raids are great but for me, nothing compares to trials. oh how i patiently await the day for our glorious endgame pvp to return...
---
? even white guns have the same TTK as exotics unless rampage or kill clip or something else is active. Depending on archetypes.
---
Warlock nova warp class has charged grenade which one shots. One time I one shotted 4 people with one grenade. 
---
If you are talking about one shot special weapons, you have access to them too. Green shotguns and snipers does the same damage as their legendary archetype counterparts.
---
At least 50% or more of a person's kills will come from their primary not their special. Although I admit this is my own anecdotal data.
---
We hear less about warlocks and they are played less because they are not as fun. But a dawn blade warlock is as strong as any other subclasses.
---
It seems a lot of the complaints in here are from people not understanding the mechanics of the game enough. Most games are not fun when the person playing haven't invested the time in to understand mechanics. Just like basketball or baseball etc.
---
Now when you put it like *that*...
---
You'll have to buy it again sadly
---
Model 8 Red. I like the one it has, I had to go look it up. (Edited the top post)
---
You obviously deserved that.
---
Obviously.
---
No... that’s the title of the video there.
---
I appreciate this
---
let's be real we all did
---
OK since you dont get exotics from campaign how do u get the sunshot?
---
This is new with armor 2.0 and Shadowkeep.  I kinda wish they would have done a basic set, then give ornaments for all the others.  Infusion would have been much easier and cheaper then.
---
I hope they did the secret handshake afterwards. That's a rare opportunity

I can only connect to my PC if it VPN to my house, and even then, D2 isn't setup work with the Steam Overlay virtual controls, so the only thing I could do was mouse around the director and Look around when you land on planet. I tried editing the virtual controller layout, but nothing actually worked for controlling the character.
---
Hes probably the newest to the game too haha
---
Too bad so sad.
---
Go see Petra....she had them to pick up when I did the quest.
---
there is a nightmare that spawns near the entrance to the temple of crota, maybe that has something ti do with it, the nightmare is 970
---
Very interesting, it has some straight forward mechanics, and you get at least one legendary for every encounter, of which there are three
---
Have you completed the nodes and codes quest line on Mars?
---
Alright looks like I'll be waiting till november or december until I can get my GPU, as much as I am loving this game don't think I can justify spending that much on it
---
r/DestinyTechSupport  may be a better place to post this.
---
Geometry wars is the cannon prequel to destiny now
---
All guns and armor have random stats and perks etc so if you get a shotgun you already have, dont dismantle it right away because it could have better perks, this is the massive change between then and now you might already know but here's a heads up in case you dont.
---
I see you’re a hamon user of culture as well
---
I'm in my 30s so I understand, hands are starting to slow down too. I got bagged like crazy when I crutched telesto to get luna then Mountaintop/recluse to get legend. The bags came fast and often lol. Just gotta take it on the chin. We didn't make the game.
---
Get rid of all your armour 1.0 as it is unusable. Anything that isn't random rolled that can be pulled from collection can be deleted. You sound like a hoarder.
---
You can play everything besides forsaken and shadowkeep
---
Tell me about it, my steam name is BigGayBear
---
Loving it!
---
I'd say the benefit of a disc install would be you don't have to wait on a 100gb game to download, (or whatever it is now and days) and save some data. Would probably be mainly the patches that need to be downloaded.
---
Yeah after all the super changes for shadowkeep it's surprisingly easy to gun down most supers in the game
---
how much is one hundred and forty hundred
---
You don't know her life.  She if free to choose...poorly.
---
Didn't see that twist coming did ya?
---
I'm not. I never set that.
---
Its like $15 or something a month for hundreds of games for free (game pass) lots of deals on games and live itself. For example, that new outer worlds game, get it day 1 for free.
---
They're separated so they're easier to organize and see. Quests are longer term and have no time limit and bounties are timed and so you normally want to get them done.
---
They didn't change the amount, they changed the way they're organized.
---
They have their places.
---
Coldhart is pretty solid single dmg
---
Wavesplitter has its place in crusible as does the solar one (sorry, I'm blanking)
---
Divinity is also amazing Dmg in a team, like easy 1 phases and three shot kills on strike bosses.
---
Yeah, and a total lack of exit path lighting.
---
No, but seriously, that would help me find my way around.
---
Well that escalated quickly.  Someone tell the vanguard not to come to the tower tomorrow.
---
For those who are interested: I did refund the Standard Edition and kept the preorder bonus with the Deluxe.
---
How pathetic do you have to be to unironically screenshot somebody else's post and steal it without even cropping it correctly?
---
That's nothing compared to my 99+hour ps4 game download.
---
Now get it into the queen's court!
---
He just wants a chat
---
In that case you are better off to just download the F2P stuff on the platform that you want to play on.  You will have to download it anyway with the disc as there have been loads of updates.  The difference will be that you will no longer have to put the disc in to play.
---
Just be aware that F2P starts differently than D2 did and you will have to go to Amanda in the tower to play all of the campaign missions if you want to play them. There are also no rewards for playing the Y1 campaign missions now.
---
On the bright side, when you login to the game you will have your character(s) from when you played before, any equipment you earned, and everything will be 750.
---
...I’d be fine with that.
---
Old day man yells at night man
---
I've had three drop this week. Was the drop rate drastically increased? I was lucky to get one per month before. Two were actually decent drops: sweet business and thunderlord. Still no lunafaction boots though. :(
---
Join a clan.
---
i’ve been a hunter main since my destiny conception, since the dark below. all i can say is that once upon a time it was difficult being a hunter in raids; no one appreciated our contribution as we frankly were not a support subclass. since the taken king, things changed. now hunters are a great asset to a raid fireteam. 
---
i feel sorry for him, however, as warlocks are insufferable and unfortunately it’s often difficult to have a similar sense of camaraderie with titans as to that found in a fellow hunter.
---
Seems there is quite a few issues with forges right now, between the key mold to the forges crashing people’s game. I’m sure Bungie is aware and working on fixes
---
What does your quest step say you need to do?
---
True that
---
Everyone is good enough to get 2100. It's obscenely easy now. Go get the gun. If you still cannot at this time, I hate to say but you just dont deserve the reward imo.
---
We need a Rubik's cube ghost in destiny 2
---
Definitely. Never regretted a penny.
---
Bungie is mean
---
asking for nerfs in a PvE game is the most betamale thing i can think of tbh
---
Oh no DX
---
I deleted mine.  Didn't have any issues.
---
he spawned in with heavy and dropped a brick each time he was killed even tho heavy wasn't up lol
---
\&gt; I constantly fall of cliffs
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Found the warlock
---
Ouch... you guys still got dial up out there or something  :x
---
I had it earlier too just roaming the moon
---
I accidentally posted this twice
---
Lol well I guess I just don't know how to read! Sorry mate. /s
---
*shoots it*
---
Oh shit never knew so all the dlc dose is adds raids story exotics and some other stuff thanks
---
When I choose TDM, I'll end up getting 5/6 people and then suddenly it resets to 2/6 (my friend and I). What's going on?
---
That’s it!  Now doing that gets expensive resource wise so it’s a decision you’ll need to make.
---
ohh, I know that feeling...  
---
Last time I was feeling hopeless and angry is when I was at GoS. That barrier Hobgoblin really hates me, everytime i tried to burst him with my Wendigo, he would pop his shields and reflect my grenades to my face
---
It is prompting me to insert the last key which is forged through the key mould but ADA-1 isnt giving the mould to me.
---
All good, just letting you know since the mods will probably remove this.
---
In all my attempts I opened the loot chest after the bridge and often also the loot chest from the 6-legged tank. The quest indicator stops working when i enter the jumpship area. I am following the quest markers and doing what my robot friend tells me to do.
---
Punch it rapidly until it opens up.
---
They disabled both it and the helium fragment tunnel with the release of the vex invasion. Don't know why since you can do the same thing by rallying to a pub event flag.
---
You can still activate the consoles to get a purple ball and go worship at the Alter of the Jade Rabbit.
---
Thanks for the reply I appreciate it. It's lots of fun so far!
---
I’ve had mine for over a year now, it’s pretty convenient when I have access to a wired connection
---
I personally think it's  a weekly thing, everytime we bring back an artifact after we have to collect 25 pieces and return to eris a ghost disappears.
---
I think after eris is free we get the emblem.
---
It's somewhere in your Pursuits tab.
---
Go ahead and go through the install process, and when it asks for file location, just make sure it's pointing to the location where the files already are, and for me it found them and "installed" much quicker than having to actually download and install everything like the first time.
---
To verify integrity of files, once it's installed, right click on the game, to go properties, then local files, then choose verify integrity integrity of files.
---
That's a plus then. It may have changed with the requirements to get it, I just know that's how you were supposed to get it before.
---
Ok I will try
---
Seems similar to an issue I had caused by a worn out controller registering inputs incorrectly, does this only happen with jumps or while trying to run normal as well?
---
With what
---
Did you seriously not try anything before coming here?
---
Highest I've got this week was 89k with all ads killed before we killed the boss. I don't think you can get 100k with only 1.2 modifier.  My conspiracy theory is that they calculated the modifiers to give you just under 100k on hero. Last week we had 1.32 on piramydon. There is a fixed number of ads that can spawn in a strike
---
I remember using that and reddit on D1. Was so great meeting new people. So many patient people. unlike other mmo's if it isnt a perfect raid/dungeon then it is time to raaaaage!
---
How do I do it
---
Your best bet is to figure out which class you enjoy the most and spend most of your time on that one. Your main division of time comes in the form of trying to keep your characters at a high light level with good gear so you’re more useful with specific roles. Focus down your favorite class, farming exotics and the like. The other two classes being a second thought. Say, if you want to run strikes with daily bounties but you’ve maxed them out on your main character.
---
Stop making me feel stupid and help
---
Well you could think of it as a picture taken through a mirror in the first image.
---
You realize in real life a DMR - Designated Marksman Rifle (aka Scout Rifle) out ranges a burst fire rifle or carbine (aka Pulse Rifle)?
---
Plz
---
If you look at the bottom of the card, you'll see the lore tab. We put the references at the bottom of each card.
---
If you mean the ordeals than maybe, I got stupid lucky and on our last one this week I got thunderlord and wormgod caress both being powerful drops though one was only +1 the other was normal at like +3
---
That could be possible, I will verify this theory tomorrow.
---
I really like this gun. It is good, but it’s just my choice.
---
add that giant portal thing we come out of and maybe some Awoken Corsair ships
---
Haha that’s probably it.
---
What do you need help with? If it's the challenges, then those are the weekly objectives such as complete 4 crucible matches or complete three strikes using the same subclass as the burn. Basically, the objectives that show up on the map.
---
I’ve seen one this season and one last season.  Idk why youtubers get 5 every video they open them
---
Dude, you seriously had amazing luck in all your drop rates!!  How are you enjoying it?
---
when i make a new steam library folder it says new folder must be empty
---
With what? It says what to do right there in the quest description. Anything that gives powerful gear should fuel up your "challenges completed" section.
---
This is my train of thought to the “T” hahah
---
Plot twist: the workers are guardians who just can't fight well, so if they slip and fall they just pop back into existence and keep working.  So, there's no need to waste glimmer on safety equipment.
---
Do literally anything and it'll pop up. Go tower, change character, load nessus, anything
---
nah cabal they the worst of all fat dudes with crit spots as tiny their pp’s
---
Shrugs hasn't bothered me, but I've always like using scouts as well so maybe I'm basis. It never made sense to me that pulses and hand cannons outranged scout rifles tho.
---
Im glad im the left type of person.
---
Depends on the geometry of the base.
---
The formula to the number of edges is 2 times the number of sides the base has.
---
A square pyramid has 8 edges, triangular pyramids have 6 edges.
---
But for real, i don't know how many sides the pyramid in Hellmouth really has, it was only a quick joke
---
The menagerie is the best way to roll weapons you want from an activity.
---
Go to orbit, start another match, do anything like that and it should pop up.
---
Rumble is not competitive mode. You have to play Survival or freelance:survival.
---
Prime engrams are random drops. Challenges are the milestones around the system
---
Smacked a goblin in his metallic head. The vex are currently invading the moon.
---
Challenges are anything with a gold circle star thingy on your director. Prime engrams are just random drops (purple engrams) that you take to the cryptarc.
---
wait nvm
---
this made me laugh
---
I can't because my clan is a clusterfuck, we have the normal members (people who joined randomly), the veterans, (people who've been playing since year 1, most even d1, and the admins (personal friends of the owner) and we have absolutely no communication between us. I've been looking for a new clan but I'm not socially ready to play with strangers on an important activity, I'm not even sure any clan would want a high schooler in their group due to the limited times
---
All new and old players are immediately boosted to level 50 and have a starting power level of 750, with the new cap being at 960 (soft cap at 900). 
---
The campaigns are now optional and u can pick them up from Amanda Holiday in the tower (pop up the map and she is the only NPC on the right of it) Beside the red war, u can also do the Curse of Osiris and Warmind (and ofc forsaken if u own it)
---
Thank you!
---
The power of the Monte Carlo is strong
---
I laughed, and recalled every cringe I've felt at hearing discord ping every damn Tuesday  just as I walk in the door from work.
---
I somehow managed to get 2 exotic engrams in the span of 2 days this week, last time I got an exotic engrams beforehand was week 1 of forsaken
---
its looking for existing files rn tysm for the help ill notify u when its done!
---
I thought it was just awesome! Are you guys doing a raid again on Sunday? (Assuming you are the prujam who carried me through the raid, that is)
---
I have played so many crucible matches and not seen it used once.  I have even tried talking to people but nobody answers.  FML
---
Oh it worked. ty very much.
---
I’m at about rank 50 and don’t have any yet, it’s really deep in there
---
Can’t you just hold to delete on the quest?
---
Insert Gary Oldman "EVERYONE" here
---
ROTMG fan?
---
You ever eaten a Hive?
---
Nah, what the fuck is wrong with you?
---
Thunderlord and Hammerhead for example :)
---
I love Steam names
---
NetEase isn't publishing anything, but did invest in Bungie to have them make a new game. The game hasn't been revealed yet but the investment was publicly announced.
---
Maybe before hand but they have already said this year as one season ends it sets up story for the next. So I have hope. I mean did you honest &gt;!expect to find a pyrimad on the moon? I honestly wasn't expecting those until D3.!&lt; I think if they were still with CommieVision we would have just had another Forsaken with an annual pass that was meant to push new mindless features that didn't play into the story. As it is now this all seems to be working up toward something.
---
No
---
Next revive you get phalanx shield slammed
---
I had 3 drop already this reset
---
Someone had to say it
---
Not guardians
---
Didn't get one in the entirety of year two, then last week I had 3 drop within an hour. WTF.
---
I am a console player myself, Xbox one. But if I were restricted to only console gaming then yes I would consider stadia or just wait for the new consoles to come out with better hardware. However after I was peer pressured by my PC friends into getting a pc it’s one of the best investments I’ve made in terms of gaming experience. I would highly recommend getting pc over stadia. Pc does offer controller support if you get one with Bluetooth or just setup via wired connection.
---
I finally got an exotic engram and it dropped hard light :(
---
r/killedbythearchitects
---
Lol if you use the selfie emote your camera does the same XD
---
I live in a constant state of fear and misery
---
Do you miss me anymore?
---
Iirc bungie doesn't care if someone does a recovery
---
Buy it. 35 dollars? No brainer
---
Hey all! So I've been trying out this game for 2 - 3 days now on Steam (F2P) and am very much liking it thus far. I have 2 questions tho: Shadowkeep or Forsaken? I know this has been answered countless times, but I keep seeing mixed answers. And my other question is where can I find detailed descriptions of certain abilities/talents/whatever you call them (ie. how much dmg boost does well give or how much extended duration do you get with everlasting fire)? Thanks!
---
EDIT: Is it also possible to -just- buy the Shadowkeep DLC instead of Shadowkeep + season pass?
---
Nice play oem totally saved u at the end lol
---
That voice line gave me chills every single time I watched the trailer for Shadowkeep
---
I’m not even talking about exotics. Sidearms in general need a pvp and pve buff in order to get considered about being used. Cammy is known for using more obscure load outs and I can’t remember a time where he’s ised a sidearm
---
As a Hunter main, I approve of missile Titan. Just aim at OEM wearing bottom tree striker scum
---
That’s part of it. I’m just not a fan
---
I'm gonna need sources because I'm pretty current on the lore and have never seen any mention of Rezyl being the first guardian, the first crucible celeb yeah maybe but not the first ever risen
---
I am a fairy new player . I started like 4 minths ago and never got exo engrams exept the ones i bought from xur and in the last 2 weeks i found like 3 or 4 just laying around i. Crucible and gambit
---
The Steam migration is a blessing, as well as a curse.
---
