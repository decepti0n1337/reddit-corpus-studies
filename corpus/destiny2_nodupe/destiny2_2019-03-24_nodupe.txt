Do you have the templates, I kinda want to make it. Also very amazing cayde tribute (if that's what it was, if it wasnt really amazing work)
---
---
---
Different character I think
---
Wait. That's illegal.
---
Hold on to it if your not at that step in the quest theres also an achievement for doing several of them thats part of getting blacksmith
---
I ‚Äòve actually been thinking of picking up Division 2
---
He is the very model of a scientist solarian 
---
Dude no one cares if you think that, not even him.  God they get lazier and lazier.
---
And the one behind you at spawn!
---
Shhhh don't give them ideas.
---
Right. Which is a huge bummer, and even more annoying considering it glitched out at reset and got this week‚Äôs *and* next week‚Äôs invitations. Yet, for us, they‚Äôre just ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø 
---
How long did it take, and how did you do it (what weapons and stuff do you have, also where did you get the 700bpower gear)
---
&gt;just watch where they are any they wont catch you off guard.
---

---
That's the thing. It's so bugged and broken. You can be on guard behind a wall, far away. The  Abyssal Champions can be unintelligently not even looking at you, turns to hit someone else. The AOE goes through an object that's suppose to physical block it, but still kills you.  This is cheese artificial difficulty, that circumvents skill, logic, or game sense.

The whole level design gives a teleporting boss, god mode, that can one hit anybody through walls,unkillable traps, with a infinite mobs, all while only open vulnerability is fighting a team in a kill box filled with helping non stop suicide bombers. All while being on a thin timer, surrounded by basically lava that even drains your super/ability that lets monsters spawn camp the entrance.  There's actually very little skill involved other than zerging and trading blows in the whole process.  Even after getting the gear several times and finding a team formula, it's was a horrible experience. 
---
In rando party you will be luck to get combo of, tither, well of radiance, nova, another super dps, with wardcliff coil/jotunn/shotguns.
---
In pro set up, I assume the would just titan stake/marco to beat out the teleporting monsters, then trench barrel shotguns/legend of acrius the hermit, then wardcliff coil/luna boots with well of radiance with 1k voices and melt the boss in 30 seconds. But that's like top 1% of players, who probably don't even need the gear drop there.
---
My main concern is not so much the set up, it's the fact monsters can cheese and use artificial difficulty, to hit through walls, or get free kills when players can't. 
---
They may not care now. But when their player base starts falling off with all these fixes and solutions they come up, they will care then.
---
Never before have I agreed with someone so much
---
HOLY FUCK
---
More like "people are calling this a buff when it is very clearly a major nerf; people are fucking stupid."
---
Considering you total whiff here, I guess we can group you up with that category if people who can't comprehend simple concepts.
---
How has this not been made until now?
---
Yep
---
I don't mind Crucible having exclusive weapons, I just wish there were PvE equivalents (say, from getting x nightfall score solo or killing the Fanatic without taking Arc damage). Redrix's hurts the most, as a casual player I just don't have the time to rack up 5 resets in a season. It's good they made it roll over but they're still not cumulative. 
---
I got the files to print it here https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-cayde-6-ace-of-spades-72202 . It wasn‚Äôt any particular tribute, more of a starting project to get back into 3D printing but it could totally be. 
---
Never forgetting, rest in spaghetti, Cayde
---
Thanks
---
Honestly, it seems like they should‚Äôve made the knights/adds spawn still even after you insta-burn the boss. Or in more typical Bungie fashion, they could‚Äôve locked the boss to a certain amount of health to trigger the knight phase, like the Fanatic strike.
---
&gt;I don't play all the time
---
Yeah we can tell. Anyone who plays a lot doesn't want to be penalized for Bungie raising the max light level after they have been on a grind to get the best gear for each activity. Crucible, Gambit, and each raid will have gear that works better than just one-size-fits-all gear that part-timers (such as yourself) use. Bungie making your hard earned gear useless by raising the light cap is hardly innocuous but then you don't care because you don't play all the time.
---
Anthem can go fuck off for at least a year. Division 2 is a rock solid game. Massive really did a hell of a job.
---
Sorry but had to say. Tangle shire? Now I'm imagining some LOTR x Destiny crossover!.... wonder if that would sell?
---
Oh my god.
---
Lol i bet u they are going to come out with the gjallarwhistle and it will be a nade launcher with tracking cluster that would be dope
---
thanks for that means I get people's opinions on weather I should keep it or dismantled it lol üëç
---
Well that explains why I dont have it 
---
I forget you‚Äôve killed a hive god or two.
---
It's from the season of the forge Eververse engram :)
---
I just felt like making a messy logo. 
---
I know, that's why I dont have it. Cause I wasn't active a lot during then
---
It's confirmed it "shadow on a wall". 5th entry of "drifter's gambit"
---
1 of each synth just isn‚Äôt worth it. I already have more of them than I need.
---
oh yeah it‚Äôs not just a straight dismantle or keep sub. there‚Äôs a lot of advice you can get
---
I cant believe ive done this
---
ah, sad.
---
In what world do you find these useless all of those basically got a buff or were already good and just cause they aint dps weapons or ‚Äúyoutuber recommended‚Äù dont mean crap. 
---
*Mozambique here*

You, your team sucks, just kidding, do better next time
---
Malfeasance has a PvP step, last word had a PvP step and thorn had multiple PvP steps. 3 times makes it a pattern/trend. 
---
Note the 'does anyone miss x'. We get these kinda of posts all the time, this could be done for literally anything in D1, it's low effort and is simply apart of our rules, I'm sorry we caught it late but if we keep it up then it implores more people to do the same thing, and its just not needed. If you do want to do something like this, maybe make a post explaining how some old D1 exotics you want might fit into D2 right now, rather than just an image. Also, the 'am I the only one' is never the case, there's always going to be more people that think that way.
---
Also reported we‚Äôll get this scumbag 
---
Wait they're removing scrapper bounties? D: pls no, they're so convenient. You can complete them without even trying and it's free resources!
---
i don‚Äôt care if people know if i played d1 btw
---
it got removed by shit modsü§¨
---
It was my go to weapon in D1 Year 1 PoE. No captain could stand before it.
---
Not this shanks again
---
And doesn‚Äôt have that sound. Sounded like the big as gun Megatron had in G1 transformers.
---
[removed]
---
Pick up the new pinnacle weapon quests on all three characters (if you have them). Since it's a triumph now, it will unlock on all three and you can dismantle the extra two for 7 cores each. 
---
that tank crit is buggy, don't believe it's lies
---
I‚Äôll have to agree with you. I was always a warlock main but now I can‚Äôt get enough of the titan.. it just has so much badass potential not being used
---
I just did this last night, and only the masterworked weapons were dropping two cores. 
---
It happens every once in awhile not to say it‚Äôs a landslide carry but enough to call it one. 
---
I believe you meant blade barrage ü§£
---
Fabled wannabe: *exists*
---
Destiny 2: I‚Äôm about to ruin this mans whole career
---
If you can get in an auto reload situation (lunafaction boots or rally barrier) it goes from good to amazing. Can do massive damage. 
---
If you arent a warlock main, life is hard
---
Well now your showing off, on another note I need help hitting fabled in comp, sup?
---
The problem is not your opinion. It is the fact you are complaining about the game being what it was meant to be, and also, what they meant for the first one although it didn't turn out that way. If you like games with no challenge and where you can be brainlessly going through everything, Division 2 is not for you and never intended for you either. 
---
It is like if I was saying I was about to get Destiny 2, but then I saw it was a first person shooter looter, so no. Wouldn't make sense, wouldn't it ?
---
Thanks, I'll keep an eye on it.. but it seems to be hitting for 30k on other bosses too.
---
it's actually pretty great, it's the main reason that I switched my preference to fusion rifles from SG's.
---
The main perk is amazing, and combined with Auto loader it makes it even better since that if you switch guns it'll reload after 2 secs.
---
also great range, it can take full arc armor and like 25/30% armor from fallen captains at medium range.
---
it's totally worth it.
---
With what I consider to be the recent shotgun nerf, it‚Äôs a very good alternative (esp with light reactor).  I‚Äôm a fusion guy but for non pinnacle pve activities, it‚Äôs all I run.
---
Lol me too I been sitting at heroic3/2 back to back after I went on a 8 streak win now all I come across is full fire teams with a atleast 2 Luna‚Äôs or not forgottens 
---
I wanna get there solo que so bad because then I can really talk shit lol but it seems impossible 
---
Hmm this is weird. Yesterday, I did the campaign of assualting The Fanstics hideout and I am pretty sure I one shot the walker there. However, Im on console.
---
I think there's a choice between Riskrunner, Sunshot and the Sweet Business Marshmallow Machine Gun.
---
but you can get them randomly or from X≈´r 
---
Pinnacle weapons suck if you don‚Äôt have um, almost legal cheating lol
---
Even raids will have matchmaking... unbelievable. How did they thought about that?
---
Has to be on the Gambit badge in collections. I hate to be*that guy* but, please use the subreddit search feature. I honestly feel like I answer this question twice a week.
---
Did you insult me because you misunderstood what I initially said?
---
Looks like everyone is being an asshole over here. Let's drop the virtue signaling.
---
Yes, it does usually do one shot them. 
---
Maybe you‚Äôre just in the wrong here, dude.
---
Fr the two 180s are annoying af I always gotta keep my distance or use something that can outshoot like the last word which sometimes doesn‚Äôt work because comp is teamshot haven 
---
Dude! Spoilers! I didn't know Cayde 6 dies!
---
I‚Äôm fine with the Warlock jump, it‚Äôs just the Titan jump that is absolute garbage for me. That‚Äôs probably because I started out as a Warlock
---
jesus dude you been under a rock

---
The obvious and right answer separate playlist but bungie doesnt work like that. Anyway if there were separate playlist then stacks would complain as their free wins would go down. Cant let that happen. 
---
Easy clap
---
How many points is the bonus?
---
Thank you!! 
---
This got patched I‚Äôm pretty sure
---
No problem buddy
---
Which ones are the exotics you get from the campaign?
---
It is. There‚Äôs some stuff that needs to be worked on but they‚Äôre off to a good start, I‚Äôd say. It‚Äôs refreshing considering this genre seems to be cursed with games that are kinda half-baked at launch. 
---
I personal find teabagging a throwback to the Halo days and it cracks me up now and again, but I feel like the messaging was unnecessary. It was just bickering that no one gained from.
---
The original is on youtube and I *mostly* just superimposed my hunter's screenshots over it :)
---
Shh shh shhh just let it happen üòÖ
---
In all seriousness I agree with that. Which leads to me ask would a rework like that be good?
---
It just has worse stats compared to the other machine guns, that's why the recoil's bad - less stability
---
The armor design in D1 was toight like a toiger. Titans should either look like super soldiers (Halo Spartans) or space Knights with horns and fur like Shaxx. Not whatever the hell D2 is giving us. 
---
I flipping hate the enhancement core infusement system, it's a pain in the ass 
---
Wouldn't the spikes probably impale the victim and then prevent them from getting blasted into orbit?
---
&gt;spamming CTRL
---
&gt;Not having crouch on L-Shift
---
I believe bungie mentioned the stability was significantly worse than they intended
---
120 at heroic
---
There's Wormhusk Crown for Hunter and Wormgod Caress for Titan
---
All exotic armor obtained from collections have set rolls
---
Rangefinder is a god send with it.
---
I completely agree! Those are how I see them. I feel like there needs to be at least 3 tiny groups in bungie that designs the different gears for the 3 classes, unless there‚Äôs a theme.
---
Wouldn't it be your chest in this scenario? ü§î
---
Yep, I feel this dude. If I'm running a loadout centered around invading and some blueberry steals every invade I'm heated. I could've put on my reaper set if I want to slay ads.
---
Its weird they didnt actually do that. They love reusing the same weapons and gear. Just like how the vanguard set for forsaken was the coo set. 
---
I got explosive payload and air assault on my bad news roll. Is probably meh.
---
Just be 500 power and wait for the event to begin if you arent 500 power its fine cause everyone can play its just that you are gonna get wrecked
---
No i don‚Äôt think so BUT iron banner has power level advantages.  So a 700 will decimate you at roughly 400 (max power level with out forsaken). But it should still be able to be done 
---
It‚Äôs not out yet. But level advantages are on so if you are low level you‚Äôll get slapped 
---
Take your time dude you can only play it for the first time once, do all the things
---
I mean he‚Äôs kind of being an ass about it but he‚Äôs objectively right. 
---
Currently: unlimited bounties every week, free with dismantling gear
---
Coming soon: limited bounties per weak, cost mats
---
They are objectively making scrapper bounties less useful
---
A friend and I are solo'ing the content until we get up to World Tier 3, mainly because I've had more time, but he's catching up now.
---
We both find the game VERY enjoyable solo. So much to explore and many corners of D.C. to uncover. It's fantastic. AI is difficult and punishing, but for every death there's something to learn. It's not fast-paced, but it's tactical, and I don't mind that kind of game. It's a world that allows you to soak everything in and let you turn every corner. Stuff is everywhere for you to find, and I love it.
---
I think pairs give the best balance of difficulty and fun. Enemies still die quickly, you have a partner to discuss tactics and planning, but the communication is absolutely vital. We ran a few missions together, and as long as we were talking and keeping the other updated, it was smooth. Ran in a group of 3, and enemies start getting to that bullet-sponge phase. So I think pairs work best. A good balance between difficulty, cooperation, and fun, but solo is absolutely viable and enjoyable.
---
I think I‚Äôm about 600 so hopefully I‚Äôm fine 
---
Hey!
---
Exotics drop like that in Destiny 2 too....
---
In the Trickster's quest :' (
---
Wait just a goddamned flip floppin second... Youre right!
---
Op might be referring to the little thumbnail pics of them, but I'm currently out of town without my playstation so I'm not able to check.
---
The paper in the window has "Destiny" typed on it
---
Probably an artbook or something
---
I'm just mad my comment didn't get in the screenshot
---
Useful.
---
don't do the quest, simple.
---
My only issue is pvp is full of shotguns reminds me of cod honestly though where is the meta all I see is shotguns 
---
Its why i never run gambit prime without a team our designated invader has kept us going even at the most clutch of times.
---
You couldnt have made the text any smaller lol
---
Sheesh new players have it easy I swear lol
---
I agree I don't like being forced to play crucible a certain way. If it were just get x amount of kills no matter how it would be an ok step. It's only when a quest forces me to play a way I don't want to that it goes to far.
---
Some black armor exotics can only be gotten by doing the forge or a quest.
---
;^\)
---
Yeah, right don't do part of the game I payed for because it's locked behind a PvP wall with the worst PvP i've ever seen in a game
---
I hate crucible. I'm also very terrible at it. That being said, it took me maybe 3-4 nights of half hearted grinding to get Thorn. 
---
It's worse than cod in my opinion, at least cod cared and tried to balanced anything at all 
---
if you aren't a pvp player, don't do a quest for a pvp gun...
---
And it usually does just that. I don‚Äôt use hand cannons in PvP much. I‚Äôm more of an auto rifle player. I don‚Äôt shotgun either. So when they force you to use a certain weapon and then take progress away for dying, the struggle becomes real and it‚Äôs enraging. But they keep on doing it.
---
I remember back when I had to earn those blues and purples &gt;_&gt; 
---
hmm the helmet I see a bit but not so much the cloak. As someone who designs for a living, I wouldnt call those reskins. That's me. I love look and that face mask of the helm. So I don't feel the way you do about it.
---
I just googled Corsair Down &amp; yes that is the one. Thank you for taking the time to explain it. :) I think I have to stop putting off buying Forsaken. I keep thinking there will be another sale
---
The most frustrating part about it for me personnaly is that I'm not the biggest fan of HC (hate them, honestly). Using pulse or scout I usually can take first or second place in my team in terms of kills/KDA but with HC I can barely keep myself above 1.0 KDA. NotLikeThis
---
Yes.
---
Haha thanks, I need to read up on what‚Äôs changed :) 
---
No teammates he soloed his way to flawless!!!
---
I played so much prime today that by the end all I cared about was racking up my envoy kills. I was so tired of blueberries that I just didn't give a shit about carrying anymore. After the game a guy messages me and asks me to please watch a video on how to play gambit prime. Lol, I told him I would and apologized. 
---
I was agreeing with you that the meta isn't the problem my man ;)
---
I know it‚Äôs just a joke but taken boss says otherwise
---
Nice
---
I enjoy the Great Hunt set for the titan. Its the closest to knight looking armor in the game. 
---
One way anyways.
---
Honestly even seeing a picture of an exotic engram makes me happy inside, just a little bit 
---
I must say as a former stormcaller main for pvp warlocks are really powerful IF BUILT PROPERLY. Can't italicise I'm on mobile. 
---
I used to but I decided to start my hunter properly in curse when my friend bought it and now I've got three characters that are honestly not built for pvp at all. 
---
The taken got added in The Taken King though :)
---
I even blinked 
---
And sword
---
Warmind?
---
It's not enough you need to learn what it means to be a warlock in the crucible. 
---
just wait for mayhem to roll around again for last word, for comp... just pray for someone on your team to hard carry you. its what i'm doing. if you go 1-1 repeatedly you'll still reach fabled eventually. its just really grindy. then every weak bungo gives you 150 bonus glory if you've played at least 3 matches. 120 if you're past brave i think. 
---
Destiny was such a great game. So many memories too. I miss it. 
---
It is good but no where near as good as it was on launch. It absolutely melted everything, it made the game too easy üòÇ
---
Eh that's debatable. If you fall for too long before activating the jump you just keep falling at a pretty quick speed with little control over the fall. 
---
I‚Äôm excited for the new banner armor this reset.
---
Same here bud. I gotta recreate it, but the chest probably isn‚Äôt in game or I just haven‚Äôt found it yet
---
I wish but I just went from brave 2 down to Guardian 2 because of shitty match ups. I can do fine with a decent team, but a bad one just dies in the ass.
---
Go to destiny tracker and session history
---
I killed that poor guy more time than I can remember.
---
Just the fact that you're wearing that cool ass cloak is reason enough to love D1 over D2... cloak of taniks as well.
---
‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs just a theory.......A GAME THEORY.‚Äù
---
(meanwhile, wonders if anyone gets this joke)
---
This is a well thought out theory. I love it. I love all these theories that I read, well at least the plausible ones lol
---
The part with Nokris and a fake Xol, if that were to ever be true, that would be kinda mind-blowing, considering how that DLC went (I still played it cause I‚Äôm a Destiny veteran and I still love this game regardless) 
---
I do believe another Collapse level event is coming, with the Tetrahedron (triangle-pyramid/Dorito) ships. Although I think Savathun and Quira and possibly Xivu Arath are coming up next in terms of big baddies, and however that plays out, I wonder what would happen to the Hive as a whole without their gods. Also the Dreaming City storyline should be finished, cause despite the time loop and reset being a thing (which I love when game mechanics get tied in canonically; I haven‚Äôt seen anyone other than Bungie do it like this: like the Guardians being able to die over and over as long as they have their Ghost to revive them, the Leviathan Raid being able to be done every week cause of Calus robots, and the Dreaming City Curse and Last Wish raid because of the time loop).
---
I can‚Äôt wait to see where this goes, especially with Bungie and Activison splitting, and Bungie now able to work at their own pace. I just hope that Bungie takes their time and that they don‚Äôt try to rush with future content. If they need to take some time to make sure something like the next big Comet DLC (like Forsaken) or their next release (like Destiny 3, although I hope they just add onto Destiny 2, but if it is a separate game, I just hope they give it a good reason for it to be) is good to go. I‚Äôll take waiting a bit longer for good content over rushed mediocre content. But either way, it‚Äôs Bungie‚Äôs game. And I‚Äôm still stuck with it after over four years as a veteran because I‚Äôve put in so much time and I actually love this story that I weave with my Guardian and others (although I wish my Guardian would talk more). 
---
Holy shit, this comment is longer than originally planned. 
---
Either way, this is a nice theory to read. Every here and there, I find some cool and plausible theories to read here.
---
I just think that both types of players should have access to all the weapons. Not in the "I am entitled to this" but in the I can earn this in a different way but still put in time and work for it way. Going all the way back to D1 I did all the challenge modes and flawless raider and had all the weapons but this game is frustrating because there are weapons I just can't get because I can't win enough matches. Raids are a great example, one can spend hours at a raid boss and they will eventually get it, the same cannot be said for a competitive pinnacle weapon. 
---
it‚Äôs like Truth and Dragons Breath has a baby and it‚Äôs still growing up
---
No, where was it?
---
You will have to wait till next week they made it where you can only do one per week.
---
Where is this picture from ? Content looks hilarious 
---
Dee would never get 1st place because she would just throw up from the attention.
---
Well at least that‚Äôs better than my friends friends parents, they‚Äôd do negative reinforcement where they‚Äôd want him to keep doing well so he wouldn‚Äôt be able to play video games at all when he did good
---
Look again they were only at 3x...
---
Honestly we did it with clusterbombs again.
---
We used tractor + 5 random cluster rocketlauncher and she still died.
---
IMHO it did nothing but buff other weapons.
---
Can I see it? 
---
still boggles me which dipshit at bungie thought it would be a good idea to change the shaders 
---
Wow *clever*, you copied me.
---
So not only are you friendless, a douche...but you also lack originality.
---
No wonder you're all alone in the RL.
---
I think if they changed it now it would spit in the face of players who have already completed the grind for it (Not me I'm about halfway to Luna). Maybe alternative ways for future weapons but current weapons should still require the grind 
---
I would also like to see ponchos rather than the marks now, are they practical? Nope, but they look cool and I want them
---
"just use one thousand voices"  
---
\*cries in 84 clears\*
---
Shit ya caught me
---
*Gary.
---
Yup I did mine the hard way too. And the team wiping as an invader for malfeasance. Neither were easy but malfeasance was a bit harder. 
---
Was it where you fought the tank on the twins strike?
---
For somebody like me who's only missing 2 exotics (Lord of Wolves and One Thousand Voices) this really doesn't seem like an issue. Xur sells exotics every weekend and eventually he'll sell what you're looking for. His engrams also do not grant duplicates so that's a bonus. I understand why you're angry though, that bullsh*t happened to me a lot. At one point I got 3 of the SAME exotic in a row.
---
Poor guy...
---
Kill Bill.
---
Gotta let the kid make his choices. Even if we all know it's the wrong ones. 
---
A few months late to the party but yeah
---
Le Monarque users get no love here... 
---
I said  "if you don't like halo then" before that 
---
Titan armor in D2 looks like power armor from Fallout 4
---
This isn't an LFG sub.
---
Rule 13. 
---
Never trust someone who can't even trust where they'll land.
---
Is it malfeasance actually? 
---
God I miss Destiny 1
---
It's better than other exotics so I don't see what the problem is. 
---
Did they fix destiny yet
---
Here is a power leveling guide: [https://youtu.be/xgMqkgG-Kw4](https://youtu.be/xgMqkgG-Kw4)
---
Works the same for all power levels. Just make sure to be doing the drifter bounties that get you 640 blues. If you do all the milestones, power leveling is easy. Scourge of the Past is a quick way to level.
---
Why are you bashing destiny sound track is destiny sub? Of course you are getting downvoted 
---
The PvP ranking might need to be adjusted, a loss is brutal.  I think that is the real issue people dont like.
---
Ah okay. Someday I‚Äôll get it maybe so I won‚Äôt make nub comments like this, sorry haha
---
# Once per character per week yes. 
---
Yeah that hunter cloak and helmet looks so awesome. I don‚Äôt see anything like that in d2 sadly ;-;
---
Gambit Prime is a really badly designed, boring gamemode that is totally dependant on the Primeval phase, even more so than the original Gambit. 
---
All you have to do is have a semi decent invader who gets a portal EVERY TIME YOU HAVE A DPS PHASE. So every bit of damage you do is neutralised by the invader. 
---
There is no rush in banking motes, doesn't matter if you're 5 minutes late to summon as long as your invader is decent. 
---
Having the DPS phase rely on a static location well of light is also another terrible, terrible idea because the invader also knows exactly where you all are, and it's likely that all 4 of you are camped up there, making for an easy team wipe. 
---
The main complaint about Gambit was that it lasts too long - so they made it 1 round - that lasts JUST AS LONG AS 3 ROUNDS. 
---
Having Gambit sets also makes the game completely reliant on teamwork, which is literally impossible playing without comms. The mode is heavily weighted toward an organised team, and solo players get shafted yet again. 
---
The worst part is that this is the focal point for an entire fucking season. Division 2 is looking more and more appealing. 
---
You can make loadouts on dim and such. 
---
Not bashing only saying the halo soundtrack is better
---
Anthem take note
---
I will agree with that. I was thrilled earlier when I won two in a row, finally going above 300 glory, then lost once and went back down to where I've been stuck at. 
---
That's still same thing

Masterworks don't change, they are fixed.
---
Imagine doing doors
---
Here's a post I made a while back that has some really useful tips for new-ish players: 
---
If you're new to Destiny, I have some lovely links for you too: 
---
___
---
&gt;Heroic Public Event how-to:
---
* https://imgur.com/a/DgT9tIr
---
&gt;Braytech.org (currently down, for me anyway) - great website for tracking your account statistics incl. ghost scans and lore checklists:
---
*  https://braytech.org/
---
&gt;D2checklist - basically similar to Braytech but tracks other things (it's very good for checking bounty and quest progress:
---
*  https://www.d2checklist.com/
---
&gt;Destiny Item Manager (DIM) - self-explanatory, Bungie's amazing API allows hooking in to remotely access your vault and change equipment in your browser:
---
*  https://destinyitemmanager.com/
---
&gt;Lowlidev's Destiny Map - I know at least Braytech links into this, it's essentially an interactive map that tracks almost everything you can scan, collect, kill, visit or otherwise:
---
*  https://lowlidev.com.au/destiny/
---
&gt;Finally NIRIS.TV, the creator of the infographic in the OP. Miscellaneous tracking and helpful tips: 
---
*  https://www.niris.tv/
---
You may want to sign into your battlenet or PSN/XBL account to access the full abilities of most of these, however they'll assist you massively when it comes to collectables, quest tracking, finding items and other stuff. 
---
I‚Äôm currently grinding to it too if you wanna play a few games. I‚Äôm on Australia time tho
---
It's a very satisfying campaign. The loss hits hard even when it's the introduction to Destiny, the characters get enough time so I can remember who they are by voice (even if I don't remember their names), vague hope/light connection works with how we're making things better for the planets and people, main Vanguard fireteam story fits in, we actually restore what was lost as well as defeat the bad guy, the bad guy's sympathetic angle is acknowledged  without redeeming him for no reason, good guys learn a personal lesson, everyone's happy.
---
Maybe if titans had a more practical use than melting point it could have been different.
---
Cabal on the field! (I use J√∂tunn and 21% Delirium while invading btw) 
---
thank you so much, you're an angel
---
*I didn't say it was bad game design.*

Why doesn't destiny realize we want to look like soldiers and not Warhammer/low level mages?
---
I suspect there'd be a lot less bitching about Luna's if everyone had it, too
---
I downloaded that shit before I even made it to the shard. That crescendo when that ship flies over the cliff...made my eyes sweaty. 
---
It has to be Void to progress the quickest and there‚Äôs honestly not that man Void hand cannons. 
---
I play with the music muted.
---
Looked again. Sorry the video was poor quality. Anyway, yeah, tractor + nova is faster now regardless...
---
Shadow on the feild!
---
can only speak from my own experience but i see TLW, thorn and ace more than lunas or NF. NF only shows up when i don't back out of a 4 stack in time and the sweats come in. 
---
Dee would continuously lose 15 motes.
---
Of course. I just want it for collecting purposes probably won't even use it because I don't like handcannons that recoil like that. Just really think that there should be other ways to get it instead of 2100 glory. 
---
Hey wait he sub is d2 not d1
---
This is a good question and idk why
---
That's harsh you should get - 30 glory at most. 
---
Let me guess, you were playing on your warlock so those decrypted as Crest of the Alpha Lupi (Hunter) and ACD/0 Feedback fence.
---
I admire what you're trying to do, you'd have better luck in the Discord or r/lfg and you can't advertise clans here. 
---
Wow can't relate
---
Vex on the field! (See you on the Gambitfields, Brother!)
---
I mean with 2-3 nova bombs and tractor cannon you can pretty much one shot the primeval at x1-x2 :P
---
I was on a 3 win streak, sitting at 1626 glory and then lose one game that's a 2v4 from the start, like I'm talking the start of the game the faceoff was just me and my friend and 4 enemies.
---
Idk how they just fucked up mostly everything in D 2 they had such a good following of fans . They need to get a whole new team because the people working there now have the worst ideas ever 
---
Things I'd love to see on armor
---
\- More fur
---
\- Reptile scales (not like the gambit armour)
---
\- Pls bungo bring back taken armour
---
\- Im happy with that taken armour
---
\- Feathers are cool too I guess
---
\- How about taken texture
---
Yeah a void handcannon with precision killstreaks give you the most percentage. 
---
I think it‚Äôs mostly due to the fact that you‚Äôre using taken energy(?) to invade to their side
---
Is be cancel in the first minute in the match if someone leaves.
---
Well if someone leaves 2 min later the match continues.
---
Probably because D2 focuses on strong connection more. Fix your shit internermt instead of trying to be cheeky 
---
r/sharditkeepit
---
Haha skulle ocks√• bli f√∂rvirrad
---
I had like 173 yesterday then mast worked a duke for pvp I‚Äôm now down to 14X 
---
Pssssh, Destiny never loved me. 
---
That was heavenly 
---
IKR?
---
I'd say try all out in both pve and pvp taking note of how well the perks combo together and with the weapon and only shard the ones you are either disappointed by or don't combo well and keep the ones you are amazed by, that's how I do it. 
---
It‚Äôs like that in D2 too
---
I dont thin knots the Guardian vs Guardian thing they dislike. It has to do with the dark power Drifter uses I. The Gambit that worries them. 
---
They are avatars of light and this is not the light.
---
I can confirm that by invading you are seen as 'corrupted' by taken energy
---
So you've never seen more than 10-12 people in D2? Come on..
---
^In comp or iron banner. Got it pretty fast in comp
---
Ye I figured but I got D2 on PC
---
I want the d1 engrams back,  you know how you could get a boots engram, or a primary, I want that back
---
Reporting in after a solid week of trying. Still no luck. It feels like if you‚Äôre bad at destiny (like me, older, slower reaction times) some of the weapons aren‚Äôt really obtainable.
---
I like how it has shimmering lines that move along whatever is painted with that shader. 
---
I have neither Last word or Kindled orchid but I'm trying to get kindled orchid. 
---
Did you complete the warmind DLC? You get the Ikelos handcannon which is void
---
After my first bomb I couldn't trust exotics...
---
So I've been on hiatus from this game for a while and I keep seeing a lot of OEM memes. I dont remember thinking it was all that good, what makes it OP?
---
Sad reacts only
---
Funny thing is there was more people on the sides. I couldnt fit them so i just captured the biggest group.
---
I failed...
---
Kein thema!
---
That was sexy 
---
Are you delusional? Do you suffer from mental illness?
---
I don't know how to italicise on mobile. 
---
The top two are both hunter.
---
awesome thank you
---
Gg. 
---
Scatter horn is the ugliest armor in the whole cannon 
---
*oh, it‚Äôs just 1 asterisk on each side of whatever* you want italicized
---
when bungie hears complaining abou thte chaperone quest.
---
**you put double on each side** *if you want* to bold it
---
*Thank you so much*
---
***thank you again***
---
Lol!!!! I was just thinking about they üòÇ ded 
---
The armour looked so much better.
---
Feelsbadman.png
---
I always used chatterwhite
---
Relatable 
---
What role are you looking to play?
---
you could feel the impact from firing it
---
*no* **problem* bro
---
Dps
---
he has weekly bounties?
---
This is a destiny 2 subreddit.
---
Thats kill clip
---
any way of fixing it? like setting it to only find better connections
---
PvE stuff: Blast Furnace (max range, Snapshot, Kill Clip), Trust (Rapid Hit, Dragonfly w/ spec), Thunderlord
---
PvP: Chaperone/Service Revolver, Oxygen/J√∂tunn, Wardcliff/Edge Transit (no lie)
---
Gambit: Malfeasance/Service Revolver, IKELOS shotty/Telesto, Bad Omens (Tracking, Cluster, Blast Radius master) or Avalanche (Feeding Frenzy/Rampage) if I feel like invading
---
Is gambit a dlc?
---
How about that original Reddit Gold medal
---
Hunter 
---
A friend got three exotics in the leviathan raid granted all three were skyburners
---
All they needed was to make eyebrows darker/more visible for most of the hair colors
---
OMG!!! this happened twice in a row to us...we backed out and redid it again if you dont have a mic fine, but you can still hear us with your tv speakers if you just turn on fireteam mic 
---
Haha! I had used all my heavy ammo to deal with invaders, and my super was used to clear the envoys.
---
We didn't know about it at the time, we were just happy to finally be winning games of gambit
---
And also the curated HC from Last Wish. It‚Äôs basically a fatebringer without explosive rounds.
---
We told the guu with us twice, he didn't gave a f*** about it, and he was surely seeing our message in the chat because he talked with us earlier in the strike

---
Snapshot sights and kill clip üëåüèª
---
No it's a gamemode. 
---
Maybe but I'd rather no have count on that happening. 
---
If you say so lol
---
Reset my game it was glitched everything is working now
---
I miss having guns that I actually LIKED using
---
Regicide was godly, honestly my fav song from TTK
---
You guys make a cute couple! 
---
If this chick walks in to Eververse she is going to want to talk to the manager, I know it.
---
Yeah, I saw the middle tree for sunbreaker and thought it was cool, trust me, that shit, looke superb, but there's no real incentive to choose that over the top and bottom treenif there's no actual melee besides a hammer that's only good for pve
---
yeah, didn't think of that. just went for the lower material cost vendors
---
Not sure I follow. It has the same Black Armory symbol as the others?
---
Ok so as a 5 year veteran of Warframe allow me to tell you a few things, you cannot compare a free to play model to a $60 AAA title. The monetization structure and release cadence is totally different.
---
However if you really want to compare the two games then let me correct you. Warframe has essentially no endgame, sure the power fantasy is there but there isn't really an activity that is worthy of the level of power you eventually obtain.
---
Warframe has massive content droughts, it has some of the worst content droughts I have ever seen in a live service game. 
---
Whilst Warframe isn't pay to win, it is pay to not play or pay to speed up. Which can make a lot of content in the game redundant. Warframe has everything directly purchasable, so if you have enough money you can purchase all the needed weapons, frames an more. This is like being able to purchase Legendaries and Exotics in Destiny.
---
Over the last couple years, a lot of the new frames and activities have been underwhelming, buggy and met with criticism because of this.  These are just some of the bigger factors, I could go on.
---
But to say Warframe is better without really giving a reason other than its free is pretty poor reasoning and logic. It's a subjective topic, but something isn't automatically better because it's free.
---
It's 2019 those jokes aren't funny anymore you clownfish
---
And now half of what i hear in the streets is how much you and your clan are making a difference.
---
We'll see
---
Eh, you play either for glory or for quests/triumph. That's how this awful system works.
---
Give us the option for multiple ghost voices i.e. sagira, dinklebit, or nolan
---
Hopefully, bungie is fully capable of making a fantastic game. I just want to be happy with the way my guardian looks again. Titans are about the only ones with decent armor sets imo. 
---
My favourite load out is Blast Furnace, J√∂tunn and Hammerhead. It destroys in crucible and is also great in pve, I highly recommend you try it out along with the Crimson hand cannon, it feels so crispy with the pulse rifle feel.
---
Yeah idk what they were thinking with that hammer melee. It‚Äôs a cool gimmick but in pvp it‚Äôs useless cause it doesn‚Äôt do near enough damage or have the same flexibility on hit registration that throwing knives or the chaos reach melees have, and in pve it only does enough to kill trash mobs, one at a time, and you have to run into the middle of a group of enemies to retrieve it which is rarely a good idea. 
---
Meanwhile the warlock ball lightning does aoe damage, has very little casting time, and comes back fairly fast cause of the arc pulse things that come when you kill people, though it has less range (but the max range of the ball lightining imo is a perfect distance to where it‚Äôs still a good idea to throw it and easy to aim it, whereas the long range of the hammer is harder to aim and also, at a certain point you should just use a gun)
---
What's the last perk? 
---
I kinda gave up on Titan exotics, the only one I use is  Lion Rampant. 
---
If you're a primarily PvE player then neither of these weapons are that great for you.  Both only really shine in PvP.  A good Kindled Orchid with Rampage/Killclip or Rampage/Surrounded will do much better in nearly all PvE activites than Luna's or Not Forgotten and SMGs are just bad for most PvE activities regardless of Archetype and Rolls.
---
"This weapon gains increased damage from melee kills and kills with this weapon"
---
/r/sharditkeepit 
---
I really like grave robber on short range weapons in pve, but that is mostly a personal preference thing. 
---
Crimson is a hidden gem, ESPECIALLY with catalyst
---
Good or bad I don't care. I am a collector and I am missing them. It is that simple. There needs to be other ways, still requiring pvp, to acquire them. 
---
Ooo sounds fancy. 
---
i personally always have something else playing on my other monitor. be it my own music, a movie, tv show ect. having a games's soundtrack on top of whatever else is just annoying, so i have every game's music off from day 1.
---
ill turn it on when a friend makes a comment about it, but only for a few mins then its back off again
---
Huckleberry number 1 ? Really I honestly didn‚Äôt care for it. No mention of telesto 
---
I wish exotics were as easy to come by in d2 as they were in d2. I recently did like total of 60 strikes to get the Oxygen and not even a single exotic in the 6-8 hours it took. 
---
Spectral blades are worse.
---
Your children will be really handsome 
---
I agree but OEM makes for more memeable content
---
Yea, after kill you get one stack and after mele kill 5 of it
---
It's an add clearing machine and when killing tally is at 3 it's decent against bosses so yeah decent and something different to Thunderlord .. 
---
sorry I can't hear you over the sound of your deafening clown horn honks
---
Sorry I cant hear you over your outstanding racism üòÇ
---
Bloody Croatian raids. I prefer mine in good ol‚Äô fashioned English
---
You guys are adorable. I gotta say tho, that shirt is sick and the guy on the left has some killer eyebrows. What class do you guys play? 
---
Favorite raids, exotics, gun archetypes and planet/planetoid?
---
While it is true that destiny is not a solo game, i have never met anyone with hate for solo players. It doesnt affect my game. So i dont really care if you play alone or with 3 friends sitting in the same room as you. The only thing is as a simple answer destiny puts heavy emphasis on team play.  Everything is easier with a team. Its more fun as a team. You dont have to be redeem level good to play with a group. You just have to have a basic understanding of the activities you are doing. 
---
I did put ‚ÄúCrota*‚Äù in the comments... 
---
Only in regards to exotics. Everything else can be farmed or is a common drop.
---
D1 had two titans. Recently gave warlock a try and havent looked back. Hunter doesnt get a look in. As im PVE solo i need the warlocks OPness. Lol
---
That's not Glory, it's Valor, you don't get free Valor points. He needed 2000 to reset it.
---
Over 400 down. Fuck me, if I could get anything like that connection
---
Day three, the clown continues to jape and jingle in typical jester fashion. This biologist hypothesizes it could be a form of attempting to attract a mate. This theory is further supported by the subject's comically large red shoes and loud honking . Observations on the clown will continue. Cut tape.
---
Oh I see, when I do T3 I can only put in the large one. Haven't actually tried. It will take u maybe 10 minutes to test and see what it does. Let us know what u find out if u have a chance. Tx
---
Definitely reporting that one for racism. Have fun with your bans kid.
---
Happens every single time I try to do a long range blast of the Ball lightning melee. Turns me a full 90 degrees sometimes.
---
I went back and checked and the game won‚Äôt let me put it in now
---
As a guitarist in real life, I need that emote. 
---
NEEEEEEED
---
Why does that smirk look like you have succeeded in luring him to you 
---
Crikey, this clown is all rustled! I'm gonna wrestle this beaut and shoe 'em who's boss!
---
Okay but that‚Äôs his name from now on
---
Yea and the bans for trading with someone else who got illegal platinum! Yea! And the bans if you suddenly do really reall well and beat a world record legit! Yea! And the raids are cool and innovative! Yea! And also the PvP content is so good! Yea! These are all points you conveniently glossed over in why warframe is so good.

---
Try Metro Shift. Or Precursor Vex Chrome.
---
Lol, well, better than nothing hehehe. PS, lvl EP best place to get the kills for Cold heart. 
---
i thought that was someone dressed like a bear in the bottom left hand corner
---
You say that, and in theory yes, but it is a very hard target considering the constant bashing of right bumper and is easily evaded if the hunter has any semblance of sense
---
‚ÄúSuddenly‚Äù
---
I kid u not my last game of gambit before coming off i killed 20 guardians and deposited like 70 motes
---
Jealous, good for you guys!
---
Difficult triumph? You can't be serious, yo. You just can't be serious. All it requires is just time investment. Not wins, not skilled gameplay. Just time.  
---
Do bounties, play gambit, kill envoys, repeat. Don't even have to win, although it makes the climb a bit faster.  
---
When approaching 12k points, collect some bounties. We have numerous +50 and +100 bounties this season.  
---
I play gambit literally 2-4 times a day on two characters (more bounties). 1-2 games on one, 1-2 games on second. Sometimes I miss a day, does not matter.  
---
With such poor time investment and roughly 50-55% winrate, I reset my rank today and have 70% of envoy kills.  
---
This triumph is not difficult at all. It merely requires time investment.  
---
My issue is with the main perk itself, not the healing. It's that the helmet punishes other players for PLAYING the game 
---
Titan forever
---
I don't think so, otherwise you get the same situation that spectral blades is in. A super tanky, hard to kill, super fast, and super deadly mother **** chasing your whole team killing all in its wake 
---
Got this shotgun with one-two punch perk. This thing's a beast. Point blank shot at medium blocker + punch = dead blocker.
---
Nice. There are two people on my friends list that we became destiny buds back in D1. Wed jump on and essentially run everything in a day together. They left at D2 and randomly popped back on when it went free on PlayStation, then disappeared again into the Void Light
---
Should message them and see if they want to hang, we apparently don‚Äôt live far from each other. Miss playing with them Destiny, always had too much fun with them.
---
You need the entire set for the glow, and it only glows in gambit prime
---
What are rolls? And is master working charge time a bad idea or it won‚Äôt hurt it that much?
---
IKELOS HC in Competitive 
---
I just got it this weekend. It‚Äôs good but it also requires some skill. Like if you‚Äôre hiding behind a rock it won‚Äôt hit you like sleeper. You can also dodge it with hunter dodge. But if it tracks on to you well, gg.
---
Damn, both of you are handsome :sss
---
Mmm, it takes long time in the refuge, when I talk with NPCs, when I use the navigator, when I launch the game.
---
Auto Loading - Midrange scope - Range finder - Auto Loading Holster - handling master work
---
I honestly can't tell the difference between a 800 and a 900 charge time put I'm sure some people can, if you have a charge time masterwork then definitely go for it. 
---
