First time through this I never expected this box bot to be there. First I saw the ominous red like and then I realized there was something behind me. A good spook moment.
---
---
---
So it would seem.
---
What is that, the outbreak perfected quest?
---
well I solo-grinded for a month in Oct to get the in game gun. It was a big enough deal for me that I decided to buy it. It is A LOT smaller than I thought it'd be haha especially after they said they were making them "bigger" and thats why they were delayed. BUT all in all I think its cool enough, and looks cool next to all my other little things. GG Bungie
---
It is NOT DDoS. It sounds like wintrading. You can try contacting bungie, but at worst he'll have his not forgotten taken away and more realistically nothing will be done. As of now bungie only does bans for confirmed actions that inhibit the experience of other players like DDoS'ing or that give a player an unfair advantage through 3rd party means. Win-trading, while definitely cheating doesn't break either rule as it A) doesn't hurt another persons experience and B) usually doesn't use a third party tool/software to accomplish it. It's really people taking advantage of the Peer 2 Peer matchmaking's flaws and has been a thing since Destiny 1.
---
Don’t worry mane, in the lore i have for my guardian that I’ve made he has an awoken girl
---
To shreds you say...
---
Yes
---
Thanks man! The lore will be worth it. Maybe. Just so tired of the grind.
---
Rampage spec (black armory mod) fo increase the duration of rampage. Have that on mine its really good
---
Dude I'm solo and decent but not great so it'll be awhile before I get it. I *just* got whisper last weekend. But from what I gather it's a great weapon.
---

---
Any activity in the game has a minuscule chance of dropping an exotic. 
---

---
Activities that give powerful gear (gear above your power level) seem to have a *slightly* higher chance of dropping exotics than other activities.
---
It fucking is
---
And some indicator on if you've obtained the catalyst for it.
---
Lookin’ good Guardian!
---
Cheers
---
I never even considered D2 because of all the negativity surrounding it and even after getting free on bnet I didn't try it for the first time until a couple of months ago.
---
It's now one of my favorite games of all time.
---
This is a known issue and bungie is looking into it
---
Tried to do the mission to start the quest. Sadly not there. Will i be able to do it after flashpoint?
---
Yeah man. Same here. I played D1 a lot but life got busy and D2 didn’t seem worth it. I watched some YouTube videos time to time and it seemed eh. I was hyped for anthem to come out, was very disappointed by the game, and I bought destiny 2 a week later. I’ve had so much fun playing destiny 2 since.
---
Time to get in Riven instead
---
It talks?
---
680 bare minimum for normal but heroic needs to be at least 690.
---
Using the boost counts as completing the story. Ready to complete mission on Titan.
---
Riven diddly done **closed** till the new raised lair is beat
---
That'll be 35.00, or complete a bitch of a heroic strike that most solo players will never be able to beat. I might be thinking of something else
---
Go buy some raid banners, you are full glimmer :D
---
This man had waited so long for this moment
---
Poor Calus.
---
Everything.
---
Jeez
---
no, i mean it's different from normal as in he will take drastic no balls turns at the last minute to scare off guardians
---
$26.99 for 14 gold.
---
It could be a second character and he just pulled it from collections.
---
You'll wanna be 680 minimum.
---
The nanites the gun produces, makes your bullets do more damage. These nanites are shared across everyone else who is using Outbreak, essentially a better Ratking
---
Even if they do it w you they will not teach you from my experience they just give bare bones explanations to rush through the raid
---
f*** outta here praedyth go back to VoG that shits still mighty fine come june 4th
---
It should easily do as much damage as nova and blade barrage as it is thier twin super, doesn't help that titnas have very few exotics that assist in supers, and I think 1 that gives them super energy? Please correct me if. Im mistaken
---
Probably. Either way, getting flattened by a Titan still wearing green-rarity armor was infuriating.
---
if you get grinded by the enemies? :D
---
i agree, it's pretty easy to figure out
---
I love this gun, there’s just better ones out there that do what I need them to.
---
Must be on console. No one jumps around like crazy :D
---
Always room for more guns like that. Having enemy weapons like Lord of Wolves, Queenbreaker, and Skyburner’s Oath as exotics was pretty cool, so it would be nice to get some more in the future
---
RNGesus was clearly shining on you those days.
---
Preach
---
It's waiting to turn you into Guardian confetti
---
It would be nice to give a phalanx a taste of his own medicine with those blasts
---
If you have an exotic in your inventory with an incomplete catalyst it has a white border but if you have one without a catalyst it is a grey border
---
ah okay, the colour depends on the type of armour you've got 10 in then
---
I love the warlock and hunter old poses, i don't even remember the titan pose on D1.
---
What the previous reply said.
---
Green aura is from reaper set, white is from collector set, yellow is from sentry set, red is from invader set
---
when u buy forsaken u get the previous dlc's too
---
You would be correct.
---
Finally, someone references one of my favourite musicians
---
Wow
---
Thanks so much, sorry for being clueless
---
Those sections in strikes where you’re stuck loading in midair.
---
Hell yes. Or a shader.
---
Your submission has been removed due to being considered low effort content that would not encourage discussion or interest from the community.
---
you could probably finish off your infamy reset just by doing the pve bounties tbh.
---
Fuck off
---
Very utopic!
---
Wtf I thought I was the only one?!
---
Rule 2. Last warning.
---
This would be an epic shader. But it would be cool to buy from someone the ornament and have to complete it like a catalyst
---
What if both sides threw the same amount of grenades?
---
That's absolutely fine Guardian! I understand the feeling and I hope you enjoy your emblem!
---
THROW. MORE. GRENADES.
---
My waifu
---
You could also get a orange fiery aura by doing a prestige leviathan, a yellow celestial aura by helping in raids as a guided group.
---
We get asked this once a day - please use the search option as this very question has been addressed literally 100's of times.
---
Thank you cause in the trailer it was like “for a limited time only” blah blah.
---
I’m trying to do the outbreak quest but I need to complete the rat-king quest first. But it’s not anywhere on my titan.
---
"follows you"
---
Then I'm not sure.
---
Ahh, got it now, thanks
---
Regardless of what happened, you can't post other people's personally-identifiable information.
---
It's witch-hunting, and it's severely against the rules.
---
it would take less time to find it out on your own. take five minutes and do your own research, then maybe you can ask if you don’t find it. like... 30 seconds of literally googling your own question and you’d find out. instead of waiting for someone to come around and answer your question
---
Apparently there is a bug where if you do Zero Hour on a second or third character, you don't get anything from completing it. 
---
On your titan, have you ever spoken to Sloane, ever? After completing the base game campaign, she should tell you you did a good job for beating Ghaul and then offer you the Enemy of my Enemy quest. 
---
Note that Enemy of my Enemy is actually a 3 part quest, and only the first part is called that. Do you have any quest flags with a crown icon on Titan at all? If so, that would be it.
---
maybe you already completed it? try talking to sloanne
---
People are doing this for all challenging to get weapons, ex. Whisper, Luna, not forgotten, recluse, now this.
---
No, Xur can only sell exotics that were released before or with Forsaken, not after.
---
Sniper
---
Lol! There was a good while in Destiny 1 where I was apparently in the top 90% for the number of "On the Bright Side" medals my account had...good times in solo que....
---
[The sniper rifle, according to the reset infographic](https://old.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/blu634/1_hour_late_sorry_boys_heres_reset_for_may_7th/)
---
A living? Wow. There's that much demand
---
YouTube “how to make X public event heroic” you’ll make more friends. Don’t get overwhelmed, there is a ton of stuff to do if you like collecting and triumph hunting. Start off doing the things these guardians suggested and level up doing the stuff YOU like. When you see something you like or pick up something you don’t know about, just google it in stages. 
---
Have fun! It’s a great game and a great community
---
;-; *sad vex noise*
---
I did this with a Luna when I started leveling up my hunter. Got it from my warlock
---

Here’s the link http://chng.it/GvVmLdBvqd
---
Okay thanks, what about next week??
---
What issue is this??
---
I was thinking about how they had to lay off employees and maybe they couldn’t do this. But they technically already have the game and they just need to port it(I don’t the the process of porting and how long it takes), and this could probably generate a lot of income for them.
---
I'm just trying to warn other destiny player's
---
I believe I already had both of them when I got them from Bergusia.
---
Your clan is dead because this game is hot garbage.
---
Try them out
---
Bad rng all around. No 1k voices, no anarchy, no jotunn, no le monarque...unless i can physically get them from fated engrams from xur i dont get shit....i run 1 character i feel like im being punished for it because at this point its an absolute joke. I have over 800 hours on this game youd think that i would have had something drop for me by now.
---
It’s really too bad you can’t complete the look with Outbreak, any IKELOS energy weapon, and Sleeper.
---
Ya so im thinking they dont drop from bergusia unless youve already got them and i have to grind the other forges
---
You can
---
I’m almost certain there is
---
Either shotgun or all 3
---
Fucking 4:3 roomba
---
I don’t see the issue tbh
---
Lol I know the feeling hahahaahh
---
Fucking PLEASE! SRL was my favorite thing about D1 and I was so god damn disappointing when it wasn't introduced to D2
---
You get numbers on dart hits though.
---
I was trying to fit more with the meme itself. Doesn't the guy shoot the other with a gun?
---
For my only Le Monarque drop, I got it at the Izanami forge. I’ve gotten Jotunn to drop twice from the Bergusia forge. Sorry to hear about your luck man.
---
[deleted]
---
What is dead may never die.
---
Ah yes the memories of being trapped in there with a cute murder bot...
---
You can always check the top pinned message for the week!
---
Learned that lesson. Be humbles...always
---
I’d run an Outbreak Prime or a bygones. Both of those weapons are laser beams and don’t require too much recoil control.
---
Anyone know how to download vids captured on Xbox? I have a good clip from Tr3vor, but I can't share it :/
---
Trust me, what you are going through is nothing compared to what those who play fifa have to put up daily 🤣
---
Bruh I just beat it with 3 seconds left it was scary
---
If you didnt swap weapons you wouldve had the kill.
---
Feelsbad
---
Even worse when you're trying to melt the boss and it stomp you right into the portal unintentionally
---
I have a rapid hit/rampage roll with range MW and it is an absolute monster
---
Yeah, in rumble you can pretty much permanently lock someone in spawn, as there's 2 locations next to each other that you can watch
---
All right, all right, all right.  Trevor on the field.
---
Does an Architect count as a guardian or something else...?
---
Where can I buy from you????
---
Yes, any player can enter the Zero Hour mission, but only players with Forsaken are capable of completing it (meaning those who do not own Forsaken have to be carried). 
---
[A guide on how to start the Zero Hour mission](https://old.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/bmruj0/fallen_transponderzero_hour_frequently_asked/)
---
Yeah paint is a great program but photoshop is much better.
---
Ima need an actual location than “behind some hive filth” to actually investigate
---
heroic
---
i find people using luna's howl and tell them "nice lord high fixer"
---
Or the stomp mechanic sending you towards a wall or the abyss
---
It also gives 13.3% completion on your catalyst, cutting its completion time from 5 to 3 weeks.
---
It's probably in your own interest that you get on that as soon as you can.
---
Gz though!
---
I learned my lesson
