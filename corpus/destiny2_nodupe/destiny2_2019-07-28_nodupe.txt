Yeah now all I have to do is wait til my access restriction ends so I watch the game throw me into multiple matches of control where my team can't cap for shit while the opposing team keeps getting power plays, or get thrown into Clash and watch as the opposing team go on 15-0 run before my team can get a single kill.
---

---
Or have that one instance when I either get loaded into a losing match or another where one of my teammates will drop out of the match regardless of whether we're winning or losing.
---
Not crapping on you for the motivation but there's only so many  times you can get kicked in the teeth before you decide you don't want to live the rest of your life eating soft foods.

---
That‚Äôs not really how it works lol, no game ever created has even close to the same number of concurrent players as sales. A decent chunk of people will buy a game and play it for an hour and say ‚Äúnot for me‚Äù and eat the loss. I‚Äôve done it, we‚Äôve all done it. Not to mention that it‚Äôs been 2 years
---
Easier said than done
---
I really hate the gaming community sometimes. No wonder everyone hates us
---
Joker‚Äôs Wild was part of Forsaken. CoO was just it‚Äôs own thing.
---
Sparrow, but smol
---
I‚Äôve had that happen, different weapon, but same idea
---
Lmao gottem
---
Acolytes are the Stormtroopers of Destiny
---
I need one, NOW
---
What‚Äôs advertised vs what you get
---
Goddamnit
---
It‚Äôs good in certain situations. Tight spaces filled with ads. They get cut down by the Explosion really easy. So yeah really good against Hive thrall rushes.
---
It‚Äôs not where I live it‚Äôs just the fact that my computer is connected using a dogshit cheap WiFi adapter. I‚Äôm trying to get Ethernet soon if I do I can get around 10mbps so shit will download at a reasonable speed.
---
Thats crazy, that little of recoil on something other than PC..nice roll
---
Wow, I wish I hadn't read through that. 
---
I don't get the mentality of someone to just bash on something they don't like. I despise Fortnite. So you know what I do? Keep my ass away from anything related to the game and focus my attention on things I do like.
---
Hard to tell, but I definitely did it across two seasons, plus I did it legit. There are ways to cheese it, but you have to look that up yourself

For the catalyst to level up, you actually have to use the y1 drang.
---
The perks for both guns work while it‚Äôs a calus drang, but you don‚Äôt get progress towards the catalyst, it has to be the fixed roll drang from collections ü§ôüèº
---
Who wouldn‚Äôt want that sparrow?
---
Best week of Trials imo
---
No I should‚Äôve worded it better I just played a lot of trials during year one so that was basically my crucible
---
Fuck i thought this was a new Husky Raid video and I got excited :(
---
Never disrespect the legendary Gjallarhorn like that.
---
Later tag was some of the most fun I‚Äôve had in destiny
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
Is it good? I have one with rampage and outlaw
---
It hit the highest it was since launch not long ago. Guaranteed it‚Äôll get even higher than that come Shadowkeep
---
When you get yours, you should definitely go for the catalyst, trust me, this thing feels really good even without it.
---
With the Burger King colors
---
No. Just in your collections. You can even delete it from your vault and it will still drop. As long as you got the exotic at least once and have it in your collections.
---
Well how else do you explain getting matched with a group of people who don't cap in control or the occasional instances when a player from your team will drop out lose or win?
---
If this game had no player base I'd never see people and waiting for matches would take forever. If this game were "Under optimized" I would never be able to play it, even on my older hardware I ditched a month ago. Then theres the "Secret XP reduction"; Why does that even matter? You know, beyond feeling like game is playing itself for you?
---

Would love to know which half wit twit wrote this.
---
Honestly,it was toxic but fun
---
Same issue, no mics vs mics and Coordination
---
You can look at it like that, but you still had to pay for Jokers wild as well as forsaken. You could get forsaken and opt out of the 3 dlcs from the annual pass
---
The roll I got isn't good, rampage and triple tap, but I'm stoked that I got it regardless! I've been waiting forever to be able to get it!
---
I'm jealous of your roll!
---
Can‚Äôt get glory in comp. and I am not aging get rid of it as it is, I‚Äôm only suggesting adding a team free lobby.
---
I haven't even reached the 250 strikes triumph yet, so I guess I shouldn't complain
---
I actually really enjoy using polaris lance in PvE. I even use it in PvP if it's a sniper map, and it can wreck
---
Of course console
---
Yes. Especially when someone debuff a target with the Tractor Cannon.
---
First off the term carrying can mean multiple things you could have 3 teammates running bows but if they have good callouts you can easily wipe teams by yourself because of the info they‚Äôre giving, also you can use teammates as meat shields and have 3x the health, snipers allow for easy picks and good positioning allows you to take 4 1v1s not 1 1v4.
---
Useful roll, but not generally a god roll.
---
That's the other problem with scouts, near all of them are low RPM. They are too slow and aren't good for engagement due to how slow they are. Average RPM scouts need more attention.
---
Oh.......... my sweet summer child

Dragons breath explodes into a solar plume on the ground. Ghorn has no solar visuals.
---
I was personally a First Curse fan. And I also enjoyed Hawkmoon. There was a point where I wanted them in D2, but with all the handcannons now. It feels as if it's way too much.
---
If you play destiny only for crucible that is kinda silly. Also, it should be "reset your rank in crucible OR this specific pve thing "
---
Best.  Tattoo.  EVER

Oh c'mon man, it wasn't that bad, at least it had more content that TDB
---
I agree completely. It should‚Äôve been nice and evened out with the amount of exotics per weapon type
---
That would be true if we were still in Curse of Osiris. However, we are not and I think Destiny has its biggest player base yet.
---
Yeah , I saw that. Made me angry
---
Everyone gangstah till jah start playing comp

you‚Äôre mad that I‚Äôm right so stay salty
---
[removed]
---
except that‚Äôs not how it works when they don‚Äôt communicate and they‚Äôre too busy playing with two fingers at a time, FIRST OFF
---
Just because the games getting a bigger playerbase doesn‚Äôt mean gambit or comp are going to become more relevant.
---
But you can still use them as meat shields...
---
And my point with positioning still stands.
---
Yup fighting to the death that the only weapon he can use doesn‚Äôt get nerfed

HOW: oh boy new fallen kill them kill them all also elders are not welcome so we made a prison for them

Congrats!

Lol I have yet to do a raid. Been playing Destiny off and on since the first one came out
---
Idk it was my fav dlc
---
Hey Back in 2016 i lost someone its not easy friend to fight but each day you can fight the darkness back You are Strong, the Person that you lost are watching you daily shining down on you that are great to keep going

Yeah, meat shields in a game as fast paced as this. Against recluse and NF and LoW.

man you people really make it easy to show who doesn‚Äôt play pvp

Unoptimized? Destiny 2 runs great and looks amazing.
---
You‚Äôll have all of the free to play content plus Shadowkeep, yes. Which is to say you will NOT have-
---
*Forsaken‚Äôs quests
---
*Any of the raids or content that came out in year two besides Gambit. No Forge Ignitions, Reckoning, Menagerie, none of the year 2 annual pass quest lines, and none of the year 2 raids.
---
No prob
---
The Forsaken package includes the two prior DLCs and the base game. Buy any other game after it's released and it's the same story; you get the base game for cheap, maybe a discount on the first DLC, then the DLC that is about to come out is full price. Not unique to Destiny.
---
$110 isn't what it costs to buy the "full game" (which isn't 3 years old) either. $110 is the base game, four DLCs, and all season pass content.

This is the work of a person who stopped playing in Year 1 and only posts about it to shit on people who enjoy the game. I think the idea of letting people review games before they come out is bullshit anyway.
---
God damn. Why you gotta attack me on a Saturday homie?
---
Remember there's a weekly buff in XP gains and bright engrams for your first three level-ups of the week, that might be why you feel like it grinds to a halt after a while.
---
No like I literally stop earning xp killing enemies if i kill too many quickly
---
HOW CAN PEOPLE BE SO TALENTED IDBWIFBIS XIWBDIDB
---
If you do it too much the game shuts off the perk. Trust me. I became a solo gambit god by using it and I started noticing that the perk shuts off on its own very easily if you have already won a round. Another guy joked about not being able to get enemies to Proc it but it‚Äôs actually true. If you‚Äôre stomping a lobby and there are enemies dealing arc damage, you‚Äôll be able to go stand on top of the enemies and they don‚Äôt do anything to you. They just stare. It‚Äôs super infuriating. Even with this stuff, the gun kicks ass.
---
is it bad that i like osiris rather than warmind............
---
Wow...
---
Especially the discussion thread on steam where people not agreeing with his bs are getting banned....
---
Just wow...
---
Hand cannons are kitty titty son

THIS IS AMAZING!

When was this "review" posted? Cus this was correct information when the game came out.
---
Petition for a dark mode for the loading screen
---
You can say whatever but uniptimized? I think this game is one of the best optimized pc games on the market.
---
yeah it s pyramid head
---
There are no lists. There are no tips. Aside from quest rewards, raid boss chests, and Xur, all exotics are random drops. 
---
They can drop from any milestone rewards (anything yellow on the Director or any bounty that rewards gear), from rankups in Crucible or Gambit, from Strike or Raid chests, or even randomly on the ground from a dead add. 
---
Basically, just play and get stuff done and hope for the best.
---
Just killing foes by itself is by far not the best way to earn XP though. Just playing the game naturally as intended you hit max level after a few days of playing.
---
&gt;$110 isn't what it costs to buy the "full game" (which isn't 3 years old) either. $110 is the base game, four DLCs, and all season pass content.
---
You just listed the full game and said it's not the full game.  What's happening here ?
---
Year 3 is starting. Would that not make the game 3 years old?
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but once Destiny transitions to Steam won't we have access to player counts on PC via the Steam dashboard?
---
It would accomplish fusions not being an easier version of sniper rifles.
---
Lol you're banned, joke.  but you bought forsaken before the annual pass, right?
---
I got my friend to make the file then I 3D printed and painted.

I get the same thing when I whisper warlocks with contraverse hold to remove it and they call me out for my Jotuun, I usually reply with ‚Äúan easy to dodge 1shotting fusion with a ridiculously slow charge time or a free 1shot with damage reduction that allows you to face check a corner‚Äù.
---
console struggle is real.
---
Here‚Äôs an idea, find more players as awesome as you and form a fireteam.
---
Upvoted because I don't think you deserved the downvotes. Have a good day!
---
That Titan and Warlock on the railing though...
---
Yeah this is annoying. Every online multiplayer has the same issue. Hardly anyone plays the actual objective in objective games. Would be nice to have some kind of penalty for players who choose not to play the objective  and just go for kills (in gun games such as this). I can‚Äôt think of anything feasible unfortunately :(
---
***AMEN***
---
I see a Shadowkeep picture but I see a Anthem description...
---
Idk, but playing iron banner and frequently having invisible guns and guardians is "unoptimized" to me, and I'm on console.
---
Hey that's pretty good lol
---
What in the dum dum? D2 just hit 1 mill active players recently! First time since initial launch of game!
---
Yes
---
As a titan main I gotta say
---
That dudes a dick
---
Yeah what a bunch of stupid fucks amirite
---
Everyone have there LoW ready to incinerate this dude
---
ah that kinda sucks then but thanks for the info :)
---
No, you dont need hacker type shit to do it and you cant get banned
---
100%
---
Yeah, it's always funny when the game has a "complete the tutorial" achievement that takes like 5 minutes and 30% of the player base has not unlocked it
---
Came in expecting...well...not this...
---
Looks really good! congrats on the ink!
---
I haven't played since a little while after the Osiris DLC, I think. I wanna get back into the game but feel really overwhelmed by all of the new stuff and changes. How easy can I get back into the grind? I'm not opposed to just starting over from nothing, just to feel more collected and in-the-know. But idk. What do you think?
---
first game was only on console for a reason bungie wanted destiny to be like halo but since it sucked they crawled to the pc community so they can get more players, isnt it clear enough for you to understand that tiny fact from "being outside of steam" but oh yeah im the idiot here
---
Rad!  Any guardian would dig that cake!
---
If i meet this guy in real life imma say "mabye the reason Destiny 2 is moving to steam is cause bungie disbanded from activision you fucking prick"
---
Ah yes that was it! He wasn‚Äôt blinking or anything hm weird... but anyway thank u kindly!
---
Bro they were the party.
---
Now is the best time to be in Destiny lmao
---
Remember remember the 4th of September
---
I do agree to an extent. It‚Äôs kind of like other games, people who are there longer are more experienced and have more stuff. It‚Äôs just like Destiny really. I have a bunch of nice stuff in D2 but someone new who comes along does not. It‚Äôs just kind of basic game structure and all of the stuff is earn able just by playing
---
As a titan main my self, I can confidently say not all titans are like that
---
I see, but i seem to run iut of anmo fast when using swarm, so maybe that might be a better combo for sustained dps?

Yeah that's what I ended up doing and its workin relatively well thanks fellow gaurdianüòé

Oh well. Don't even care about the crucible much anyways
---
Indeed, I will say I personally hate the card system just because I am used to and old Battlefront where you just play. I also hate that Destiny 2 PvP is basically a few guns rule the entire PvP arena. But still great games to play if you can put some time into them and enjoy them. Hopefully with Bungie making all of the decisions now they can take D2 to the next level.
---
There's so many "OP" weapons that I don't think it'll be an issue, as long as they balance it out, but tbh I feel like we're gonna get breath instead
---
Is it just me or are some quests very vague? One time I had one where it was kill cabal so I killed some and the meter didn‚Äôt go up but then I looked at the fine print and it said psions.

---
Apologies, yes I mean USD.
---
I'm not sure I see the relevance of it being a 3 year old game in this situation.  Games like Destiny are designed with staying relevant in mind.  We're not talking about a game that only offers 20-30hr single player experience, or a multiplayer game like Call of Duty (that releases a new game practically every year--devaluing their predecessors by splitting the playerbase).  We are talking about a game that depreciates at a different pace than the games of the past. The developers don't just make it and sit back hoping to collect money.  They make it, and then continue working on it for years.  And, not just a performance patch every so often, but real game building content so that the experience grows into something that offers thousands of hours of gameplay.  
---
If you want a discount just because you didn't get to play it since day 1, the current pricing as you have described it is still $65 dollars cheaper than what I paid for everything, NOT including Shadowkeep.  If you include that as well (at the $34.99 base Steam price), your quote of $110 is a savings of $100 from what I will have paid.  That's a pretty good 3 year old discount if you ask me.

---
You took a pretty long break huh
---
Mhm, I‚Äôve spent all day trying to grind for the stupid amount of armour needed for the jokers wild badge. The first encounter isn‚Äôt bad but so boring now. The bridge is literally the worst encounter in destiny rn. From the horrible area design with those stupid cubes in the middle of every point to again the needing of those supers to make it possible. The third encounter isn‚Äôt bad but I do hate the idea of an enemy that 1 shot you. Yes it‚Äôs not the hardest thing to do but with matchmaking with randos it‚Äôs a 90% chance your team won‚Äôt beat it. You would assume that you would want to use LFG then but the App is dead on reckoning.  And the amount of time they expect you to put into this stupid game mode to get all of the gear. Not to mention the horrible matchmaking in it and the ‚Äúpublic event‚Äù approach to it.
---
Let me clarify: mathematically, making an engram cost 100% more is very, very different than making it cost a 1% increase each time.
---
 
---
In the first case, engram 1 costs 200.
---
In the second case, engram 1 costs 101, engram 2 costs 102, etc. Engram 101 costs 201, and from there, every engram is more expensive ad infinitum. One is more expensive period. One is eventually so expensive you have no choice but to buy Silver. 
---
Hopefully, this concept is a little more understandable now. This is, more or less, exactly what happened. It‚Äôs also a reason I‚Äôm very glad that Bungie told Activision to go take a flying leap.

Reckoning is awful imo, just doesn‚Äôt compare to Gambit/Gambit Prime the same way I feel
---
What software was used to make this edit?
---
Similar situation as yourself but everything is even for quick play and comp. not sure if iron banner is balanced or not. Biggest disadvantage I‚Äôve noticed is the quality of weapons my opponents have and the new supers they have access to
---
Yes but you still got 6 weeks so don‚Äôt worry
---
Hang on lemme cry
---
Well is just so fucking boring to run and there are other viable warlock supers, but everyone NEEEEDS that well go radiance
---
I compare The Reckoning to Xbox Game Room for y‚Äôall 360 players that remembered that fringe ass application that no one used.
---
Definitely the weapons you will be at a disadvantage because those with dlcs will have a more diverse weapon selection and rolls
---
However power level isnt affected in quick play and comp so you will be fine.

We‚Äôve stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars...
---
Yes. I recently hopped on my free to play and got most of the Pinnacle weapons just using green and blue weapons.
---
The one earth hand Cannon is great for starters, paired with a botheration and you're good to go;
---
However the auto rife-- I think it's called the pariah, that you get at the start of the quest line where you get your first class is very decent as well.

It's a glitch with pursuits. Go to pursuits tab and collect all completed bounties, it should fix it.

Because your typing is scuffed and you said "thank mam" but you just explained it so ok.

someone at bungie sneezed on the loading screen ok?

Holy sh#t just realized I typed thatüòÇ
---
Another cool thing is that every weapon is available to drop unless it is specifically tied to a mission you can't do but Shadowkeep is going to be pretty big but with the amount of content releasing for free is substantial.
---
Dude's just toxic he got killed by lord of wolves.
---
In the current state of the game spike nades perform amazingly against bullet sponges which was gjallarhorns strong point they would easily out perform gjallarhorn because don‚Äôt want another gjallarhorn meta

the gun is definitely worth it but if you don't want to do the grind you can always just do the mountaintop cheese
---
Even with the bumpy release sales Destiny 2 had due to a number of D1 veterans not even bothering to buy the sequel because of the changes being made, Destiny 2 was still a good selling game at initial release .
---
And it‚Äôs normal for a game to lose a percentage of daily logins after a few weeks of release.
---
Destiny 2 had it‚Äôs lowest percentage after the release CoO, and to be honest, it was understandable that a large portion of regulars just said nope. Me? I played it a bit, saw just how shallow the content was, and took a break until a couple of weeks before Forsakens release.  
---
Forsaken brought a lot of its original player base back. And eventho it didn‚Äôt have anything really game changing, the content was massive, the storyline better than most of D2s previous stuff, and for the first time in years, a lot of people couldn‚Äôt always finish everything they could do between resets on all 3 characters. 
---
The seasons had a bit of a bumpy ride, losing players here and there, but at the same time continuously gaining new players on the way.
---
Right now, I‚Äôve seen more underleveled blueberries running around learning the ropes than at any other time after the initial release weeks. Destiny 2‚Äôs population has grown massively in the past weeks, and tbh, I‚Äôm glad.

---
Fuck anyone who uses erentil
---
so do I. now let‚Äôs see which one of us soloed for all of our weapons without abusing the meta.
---
Wait, for bright engrams? Because those are completely cosmetic why would anyone give a shit
---
Cheers bro
---
Ace, chaperone and malfeasance have catalysts datamined already.
---
Last word might also but that‚Äôs in confirmed.
---
‚ÄúFrom What ive seen from the trailer, it doesn‚Äôt look good. Don‚Äôt even bother trying‚Äù
---
Welcome Guardian, please enjoy your stay, glad you're having a good time so far!
---
*sad noises*
---
Who the fuck and what the fuck
---
Ur a little low on ammo chief
---
If that sniper has snapshot than you're a lucky one
---
Did you at least buy shadowkeep or Forsaken, or both? Don't tell me you spent ¬£50 on microtransactions without buying actual game content lol
---
Warlocks and Hunters have the best forsaken supers.
---
Ahh ok
---
Just looked this up. Gotta be satire right? He sounds like the typical neckbeard stereotype on all his posts.
---
My RNG resides in God roll weapons, my Eververse RNG still sucks...still no selfie emote, but got every IB weapon god rolled this week. You learn to take the good with the bad.
---
I watched a hunter teleport a good thirty meters before deleting my head with what appeared to be a single shot from a malfeasance. Lag is a helluvah drug.
---
There's 2 types of titans
---
Titans that play them because of their power in crucible and have an ego so large not even draven from league could have more and also saltier than hunters when they get their 127638123 nerf
---
And titans that play them to punch shit and you can tell the difference from the first cuz they'll go ham without the need of strong stuff (using stuff like maul or thundercrash or maybe even ward of dawn)
---
Easiest way of differentiating them? look for the oem
---
Im not crying, you are
---
Wow, I wish you had gone to someone that could pull a straight line. That can‚Äôt be fixed.
---
It has been speculated before. Apparently it‚Äôs been getting bigger.

The grenade final kills is way too high ü§îüò¢
---
Does tapping the trigger in short bursts work as well on console as it does PC?
---
Let him shitpost on reddit while y'all play like 100 ai missions that are the exact same for marginal gear upgrades in a game with no real 'endgame' like WoW.
---
Destiny. 2.
---
No drop light level to the lowest you can go then search a forge and go afk
---
Why tf does this have negative 3 upvotes
---
My god that made me heated just reading it. All of his evidence was either past articles(talking about how the player base is dropping and xp throttling) that are not relevant now or just complete bs(the entire community are elitists and bs he made up). He talked about how bungie knew what they were getting into when going with Activision but I don‚Äôt think he did the research because they have said the reason they let Activision in was because they didn‚Äôt have enough money to self publish yet. He just takes past info and tries to act like it‚Äôs still going on and when being called out he just says well I didn‚Äôt say it was still in the game but never said it wasn‚Äôt
---
Yup. Got 2 notifications too early and one with apologies for a problem i didn't had/knew about + those "fixed" projections. Im confused as much as you
---
Tbf she was a shitty guardian as we could one shot the boss lul
---
All of his evidence was past articles and never says it is still happening or in the game
---
Not this again, I dont agree with review bombing especially when it's a game that's not even the game you're complaining about. But gearbox deserves it because there is no other the community can speak out. Nobody wanted an epic exclusivity deal and now a good chunk of the community wont be getting the game until it releases on steam. Overall it's just devs not listening to their playerbase and everyone gets hurt. The devs lose money and some players wont get to play a game they've been waiting for.
---
Competitive destiny as always been a joke.
---
Im so glad bungie split from activision back in nov 2018 when activision decided to give d2 away for free
---
That's actually really cool.
---
No
---
A week or so
---
Jesus
---
Even the vex couldn‚Äôt predict that
---
This would introduce new problems
---
Same lol
---
Look man its just here for the competitive players and pinnacle stuff
---
Yeah, stuff like that just happens, whether the Devs want it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on  Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus  Ta'aurc. From what I can gather, he commands the Siege Dancers  from an Imperial Land Tank just outside of Rubicon. He's well  protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses,  take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold.
---
Like my dick
---
Thats basegame so actually still a ripoff
---
I got back into destiny a few months ago after not playing since year one, if you dont mind playing through the three expansions, which are pretty short except for forsaken, then you'll be fine and caught up within like a week or two.
---
"that hunter next to you"  
---
***literally surrounded by hunters***
---
How do you use the laptop, on a table, legs or do you have a cooling mat of some kind?
---
lol yuuuupppp. I still have a few odd elemental weapons. like an arc ikelos hand cannon and a solar inaugural address.
---
How would it?
---
The exp thing was misreported just about everywhere. It wasnt just a backend reduction in exp while displaying incorrect exp values to the player. It was a reduction in exp when a player was completing the same content over and over again, most notably public events. Still not a good idea, but not as devious as it was made out to be.
---
Use truth or queenbreaker/sleeper
---
Inb4 Gjallahorn comes back for solar week
---
Step 1: use bottom tree
---
I think you can tell which one by my description 
---
&gt;!its the iron banner one!&lt;
---
That's not a sparrow, that's a teammate
---
One eyed hunter. Now you dont get marked for vengeance you get insta-deleted
---
this has become the slogan of my destiny group
---
–ØI–†–ûS–¢–ó
---
Finish forsaken and talk to spider
---
Thanks!
---
Slowva
---
You mean lumina also if you delete them then you fucked your self
---
Black armory dlc. You get and invitation from spider and he will give you a pass to get there. As long as you purchased the annual pass.
---
Nah.
---
He‚Äôs not expecting exotics.. he‚Äôs asking if you can do thorn quest without it and is asking if not can someone list the ones he can get.. maybe he can‚Äôt afford forsaken/annual pass.
---
They‚Äôre all really bad if you get teamed with people who don‚Äôt understand the mechanics. Menagerie is a pretty good look into why Bungie doesn‚Äôt want to allow matchmaking in raids.
---
Range and Rangefinder is going to be largely ineffective without some stability at long ranges, especially because the long zoom scopes go up to +6.  I would say you want a Particle Repeater/Firmly Planted (or Moving Target)/TTT with Stability.
---
The loot cave was amazing. I used to go eat dinner, watch some TV, or go shopping come back to 1 purple that would turn into a green anyway and a bunch of blues and greens.
---
Remember when the Cryptarch was a complete dick who would reward legendary engrams with blue's? Oh boy do I remember &lt;\3 I'll never forgive you Rahool.
---
Go I will. Good relations with the community, I have
---
The mechanics are sound, it's pretty easy, it's just dull as fuck
---
One of the fastest generating supers and can be made faster with mods, exotics, and perks. It's my go to warlock subclass.
---
No, Rose, Revealed I accidently deleted 2 of the 3 quests I need to get the thorn
---
Says you got suspended "fOr nO rEaSoN", then immediately admit to leaving a match early. Congratulations, you played yourself.
---
‚ÄúGot suspended for no reason‚Äùthen immediately says they left a match. 
---
Even if the team sucks you should stay, not everyone who plays comp is good and maybe those guys were trying to get better.
---
Unrelated af, but I miss Silent Hill sooo much. SH2 is easily one of my favorite games.
---
With that being said, I'm super hyped for Shadowkeep and excited to see a darker Destiny experience.
---
I don‚Äôt really know anyone so all I‚Äôve done is solo que competitive and I have to say it‚Äôs usually not that bad.
---
I did get matched with three people under level 10 one time on fresh accounts and we all got slammed really hard by a sweaty discord team ‚Äî but you take your losses with your wins.
---
It‚Äôs not all bad, it‚Äôs still really enjoyable.
---
Yep, with the release of shadow keep, oh boy is she gonna be a beauty. Raids are also super fun for future reference
---
I miss Vertigo
---
Looks like you are playing IB. Having max power is a must if you want to play it without being in a disadvantage.
---
Zero sympathy for you. Simple solution, don't leave games early.
---
Bottom tree striker, OEM, Erentil. Why are you like this? Who hurt you?
---
Ahh rockin the fat armor set. Too bad D2‚Äôs armor is garbage in most seasons. (Soft spot for penumbral and great hunt) 
---
And now with D2‚Äôs armor 2.0 not affecting any Year 1-2 (with the exception of solstice) i must leave behind my favorite armor sets with the perks i‚Äôve wanted. :(
---
I have like 6 pairs of Iron Truage Boots it‚Äôs bull
---
Was definitely not for no reason? It clearly says that you leave competitive matches too often as your complete to incomplete matches ratio is too low... lol stop leaving the playlist, or don‚Äôt play it.
---
Honestly, I have stomped 4 stacks with a bunch of other solos. How we did it, I'll never know
---
Nah chief I left a match cause I was solo queuing and got set up against a 4 stack and the blueberries were incompetent. But around 1 AM I just played and lost a match then left matchmaking turned the PS4 off and now we are here.
---
&gt; From what I saw the projectile should have hit the column that was between them.
---
It should have, but OP jumped out allowing it to track onto OP instead.
---
&gt; I‚Äôm not sure how jotunn mechanics are meant to function but I saw OP purposefully move so the column was between them and the Jotunn dude
---
OP barely glanced at the jotunn user, and the person was far away enough that it would be difficult to tell which weapon the enemy was using, so we can assume OP didn't notice.
---
&gt; and the round should have hit that instead of continuing to track when they repeeked.
---
Jotunn tracks anyone within a certain range. OP jumped in front of it, causing it to start tracking, which redirected it away from what would otherwise be a missed shot.
---
OP died 50% because of pure bad luck - nobody expects a random shot like that, and 50% stupidity - they jumped out in front of an open area using a super that has no super armour. It's their fault for dying, not jotunn's.
---
As someone who took about a month of play to get it. Yes it was worth it
---
Not asking for sympathy bud just want an answer as to how long it‚Äôs gonna be.
---
Warlock grenades are good (strictly talking PvP). That‚Äôs it. They aren‚Äôt great.
---
Also, titans and Hunters have some pretty OP speed-supers, which the warlock definitely lacks (with the exception of maybe dawn blade but it can be argued that it‚Äôs not nearly as speedy as the others). 
---
It‚Äôs pretty balanced in the game in terms of supers/grenades/melee. Some are better than others, some lack in comparison to others.
---
No need to complain and demand nerfs and buffs. Instead, keep working on a workaround/viable solution to get passed this. That‚Äôs how we grows as players and guardians.
---
Enjoy, Guardian =)
---
On the grind for recluse bud
---
Actually last catalyst that has dropped was Rat king‚Äôs the day it came out. Was very excited to finally start using RK again, then after my friend said the catalyst for it came out that day i got even more excited.
---
Yeah pc which is probably why like you said.
---
That was his stand attack.
---
Wait, people think sentinel is op? Have they *used* it
---
I'm guessing it's that it's pretty round and turned up rather than going down
---
It pains me to say, but if you're just trying to get the quest gun switch to whatever is killing you the most. Maybe try erentil, dust rock blues, stuff like that
---
Think you got the wrong game, man.
---
England reminds me of that one mission on the Almighty. The second i step outside i catch fire. Well, at least I have a reason to stay indoors and play video games.
---
Puh-lease. Where I live it goes up to 110 EVERY summer, and reaches it consistently for about 3-4 months straight. Highest I've ever seen here was 116, record is 118. I live just outside Arizona, which I think their record was 120-something. Arizona and southern Utah have ALWAYS been this hot. 
---
Yes it sucks that climate change has caused this, but those amateurs are acting like it's gonna kill them.
---
Kinda expected them to clutch the 0v4
---
No dude Celsius. It's so hot here all the lakes are boiling /s
---
Congratulations on your grind. Anyway, you should test it. It has its quirks in pvp, but if 180s arent your favorites don't use it. It is good in taken activities, so maybe see how you like it in reckoning if you still do that. If you like using the weapon, then use it.
---
Dawnblade is literally the fastest super in the game? Am I missing soemthing here? I thought the dawnblade movement speed was buffed, now warlocks can fly across the map and back before their super runs out.
---
Try Georgia Any time of year
---
I play the game. No I‚Äôm joking I don‚Äôt care if you farm without hindering other players like this. I personally just watch some YouTube and touch the controller every couple of minutes.
---
GA, USA I should Say
---
Plug the controller in.
---
Yeah I've had the same thing happen to me. 5 AFK'ers using macros to not get booted. 
---
Free win and 20 kill streak.
---
I do wish it was earlier, but it is supposed to be a celebration of the destiny year.
---
This is what hell must be like
---
It's an exotic quest, so more just a matter of grinding it out rather than "if you get one".
---
Blaming Bungie isn't gonna make you better lol. This is like crying at the developer because you got T-bagged.
---
I miss that map
---
Stop immediately.
---
It‚Äôs true about dry heat.  107 Fahrenheit in palm springs  feels so much better than 95 in Florida
---
Is he still up?
---
Look it up???
---
Technically. The set you receive will be v1.0, then when shadowkeep releases banshee will give you the v2.0 set.
---
Not gonna lis, that plus top tree dawnblade and Wings of Sacred Dawn was pretty fun.
---
is this more accurate than wasted on destiny?
---
That's another reason why I don't like using special ammo weapons in the crucible. I don't like the idea of feeding people that are using cheesy weapons against me. (Easy Death Oven, Shotguns, Other Fusions). I never feel comfortable using them.
---
Bows and sidearms fit my playstyle a lot better but that's just how I do it.
---
Nah I‚Äôm on ps4. But why 8 people only?
---
Cause comp is 8 man, got my mountaintop kills done in like an hour with this method
---
Thorn shotgun can't hurt me here.
---
When Mayhem os there, sure... Otherwise, normal quickplay... It aint fast, but get in a group, talk about life and stuff... Listen to music an try not to tilt
---
And an achievement trophy
---
Well yeah but you need to be close to each other in comp points tho
---
You can play borderlands offline. Cannot play destiny 2 offline. 
---
I think that is a valid distinction to make. 
---
You play online solo or with others.
---
*laughs in Texan*
---
Doesn't eye also give passive ability regen buffs too?
---
I mean, I did make a pretty dumb "joke" lol
---
You‚Äôre saying a lock with dawnblade moves quicker than a hunter with spectral?
---
The highest glory players on both teams need to be similar
---
The average glory on both teams need to be similar 
---
And the hosts need to close to each other
---
It‚Äôs possible to do it while meeting 2/3 of these conditions, but it‚Äôs much faster if all 3 of these things are on point.
---
Because hunters literally all of there forsaken supers are op, warlocks have the acr laser that pretty much can't be stopped ubless you snipe them and the following nova bomb
---
When is that guy just gonna come out of the closet already.
---
Arizona. Our summers are hell but the rest of the year is pretty nice
---
Ah man!! I hope not. Dont get me wrong. Im all for rewarding dedication. But that was kind of repetitive which made it less interesting and more of a chore. Just how i felt about it.
---
And here I am, about to move to Japan in a few months.
---
I wonder if you can get an ornament to increase its range even more. Oops. I mean barrel that has ‚Äòno‚Äô affect ;)
---
EVERY. FUCKING. TIME.
---
As a titan I instinctively punch it, as I did fanatics in curse of Osiris, which is why i failed 5 times (! I may just be bad) fighting Penoptes
---
...
---
no where near close xD.
---
Ya and foe tracer does other stuff to but the main hung that they do is just track other people
---
Yeah I‚Äôll try it out! Thanks can is it accepted by the destiny fire team subreddit or not? Cause I‚Äôll write it there if so
---
I lived in Bahrain for a year. It's pretty close.
---
ok? doesnt change the facts its a pay to win game mode end of story thats all i was saying
---
Yeah, I get in turn the controller off and the TV off
---
I agree that publicity can sway Bungie a bit too much but how is it balanced to have a super gain health back per kill when no other roaming super in the game can do it? Either make Nova Warp, Sentinel Shield, Dawnblade, Arcstaff, and Spectral Blades regain health per kill or nerf Striker. I would much rather have Striker brought down instead of the buff to the rest.
---
Also I would never down-vote an opinion as long as its respectful.
---
What we really need is Substance 321. Desert camo is the jazz.
---
I‚Äôve started to use wormgod caress. Fellow titans! Use that if you want to ascend punching anythingüëå
---
Yeah, I get in, turn the controller off and the TV off and let the PS4 run all day. If you're only getting 100 mats, it means it turns off after an hour. Sounds like a powersave setting to me
---
I‚Äôm fairly certain Mara didn‚Äôt ‚Äústeal‚Äù Oryx‚Äôs throne world considering it‚Äôs currently residing in orbit over Saturn
---
Basically after our raid team finished Kings Fall Toland wanted us to take Oryx‚Äôs place in the structure because that‚Äôs how the Sword Logic works and Toland became obsessed with it. After we left and didn‚Äôt take the throne Toland began to dislike us and thought we squandered our opportunity. 
---
Not sure if it‚Äôs all right, not a lore scholar.
---
That's because I picked the wrong square lol just realized. The actual one has a purple bottom although the shader is completely white.
---
Yes please
---
Finish the quest you got from Saladin to add the rest of the armor into the package loot pool
---
That was where I got confused. I went to my collections and looked and both and was like, interesting. My game not only refuses to drop either Kephris Sting and Astrocyte Verse but somehow my honors of the 9 is wrong too. üòÇ I didn‚Äôt THINK I had loaded up Anthem
---
Hmm I don‚Äôt see a swarm of the raven equipped tho üßê
---
Never played, looks kinda like terraria. Is it a fun game?
---
I'm fairly positive Superblack didn't have any blue in it.
---
Idk why they had to make that armor so much of a grind
---
Barrel length matters, bro ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
That was a good watch!
---
My nickname in highschool was the black talon,  please dont ask why
---
Oh the as a team super and grenade kills one? Apparently the grenade portion takes forever. It‚Äôs been at 40% all week. :(
---
Thanks though!
---
I‚Äôve had this problem in IB I haven‚Äôt been lagging or having any issues but my melee would deal no damage while using bottom tree striker
---
I find, and this may just be me, but more times than not people without a clan seem to lag more.
---
Back at home in Texas there ain't no problem, but I'm a contractor overseas and this place dont really have highspeed.... yet they're supposed to be installing fiber here soon, but the compound I live one is really like the last priority.

Bro if pennywise was a hunter he would run frickin victorian nighthawk

Basically thorn but looking like chaperone

Really having a hard time believing anyone would underestimate a pulse rifle, fusion rifle, and machine gun.
---
Like all these classes of Weapon are really really good
---
For us UK folk, any day where it‚Äôs not raining and warm enough to put on a T-Shirt is considered boiling. Then anything that‚Äôs below that is considered freezing. We tend to experience the latter 99% of the time so this heatwave has been pretty crazy.
---
I get what you are saying, being 750 is optimal, its just not a "must". Its not that big a difference that i noticed. 
---
Let me put it another way. I wouldn't want people not to bother playing a limited time IB because they are not 750, when they don't need to be 750.
---
Literally nothing ‚Äúunder estimated‚Äù about this loadout

Midas &gt; Calus treasured fight me

Hes worse actually
---
Prepare for your downvotes, br√∂ther.
---
Ahhh. There's your problem. Well good luck man.
---
I've been seeing this sentiment a lot this iron banner, that it's been miserable. Is it pc players reacting to LOW? I'm on ps4 and honestly I've been loving this IB. My w in ratio isn't anything spectacular probably 50% but my k/d has been stellar and I'm feeling really strong gameplay wise. It's amazing what a little matchmaking can do.
---
goddammit... take my upvote
---
Always go for first to bank. Gold medals are worth more so wipe the entire enemy team when you invade. Don't die so you can pick up kill monger. Really just play the game.
---
If you play 3 games in a week then wait till reset, you get a little over 100 points. You could do that if you wanted to.
---
Thanks. I just found the location where it is.
---
There are a lot of non-guardians working in the tower, and I think that now that we don't have Cayde-6 to push back on this, there's a real good chance that we can get Space-OSHA its teeth back.

What about god of war?

40 downvotes: no

lol thanks. if i kill you while you have it equipped i want you to know that you deserved it üòÅ
---
I play on xbox but yeah iv been really trying to get the hang of scourge of the past through matchmaking but I am just so clearly the pvp guy getting carried lol
---
You can play private matches with friends still in D1. I believe you can‚Äôt get the gear anymore but you can still experience it
---
There‚Äôs no need to make this post as anyone who has use of their thumbs can outplay/ignore OEM, no need to be sorry for not doing anything thet deserves penance
---
Guess Gahl-ran outta there amirite
---
There is no grenade, except the handheld supernova, that can one hit kill. An arc web nade does roughly half your health. So unless you were damaged then I do not see how that was a 1 hit. Also, it‚Äôs an arc WEB it‚Äôs suppose to reach out in all directions.
---
this has happened to me at gauntlet before too
