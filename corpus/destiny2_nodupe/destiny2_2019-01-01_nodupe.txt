Thanks a bunch, sometimes YouTubers are just so unclear, then you read comments and it‚Äôs so confusing, but you explained it better than anyone I‚Äôve seen, thank you!

How could you possibly know if it's curated if it's not masterworked? That makes no sense. That's how you tell. Unless Bungie has specifically said something to the contrary getting that roll was complete luck.
---
Yeah it's kinetic, no there's no "explosion", it just does an extra blast of damage to one enemy after you hit it a few times. The extra damage against Taken really shines, and it's a really nice hand cannon with practically zero recoil. 
---
I still use it because it looks cool. Can‚Äôt hit anything with it though and runs out of ammo way too quick. 
---
His haunting whistle plagues their nightmares.
---
Glad I could help! 
---
No offence but when referring to Destiny 1 cutscenes on the Destiny 2 subreddit, could the noob plebs like me gets a link to the video or something?
---
It just does increased damage against taken, it is nice when fighting against all taken enemies including the Gambit primevils.
---
Woah. Woah. Woah...ok. So...i disagree with alot of what you said. No one thinks of thw whole picture.  I play all 3 characters almost equally. But first off I have to defend bungie on that first its the players leaving prior to match starting sonits the community. I know I would rather go into a match 3v4 then 7 ppl be returned to orbit right before the match starts to wait on another . Idk about you but I hate baboon. Cabbage. All that. And it would feel that way. Now onto my next big one and i agrue this all the time. Every class has op something . if nova warp gets nurfed it would make the game unbalanced . here is why. Hunters have shards. Thats op. I've seen ppl have 6-8 supers in a quickplay match. That's op. Titans have one eyed mask. Thats there op. What does worlock have? Nova warp...thats it. No good exotic. Nothing thats game changing. Just nova warp. Take that away and once again..warlock will be unusable. The only way I can even accept a nurf for nova warp and make it somewhat on par with other classes is take away the healing from a kill but give them an exotic to be able to get that back. The ppl that complain about nova warp are the ones who dont have shards or one eyed mask. Sorry for the rant. Nothing against you. But the community used to be better back in d1.

"If you think something is really that overpowered, learn to use it and dominate with it"
---
I don't understand the biased point of view from this subreddit. So, he's doesn't get to pick up heavy?
---
"he could've waited for the next spawn"
---
and so did OP. 
---
the guy knew to push you away and steal the fricking heavy, compared to the usual clueless comp players I see, I bet he knows what he's doing.
---
My Australian internet probably contributed to that too. Thanks mate
---
It‚Äôs a weapon that you use to mess around with while looking cool using it. 
---
Im not at 36 but in the same boat. Feels bad man.
---
Seriously the preview image of the hunters cloak needs to include the head for exactly this reason.  Guessing what shader to put on it when half the time the hood is a different colour palette is frustrating af.
---
When you realize there's still another quest step to the Izanami Forge.... 
---
gofannon isn't hard at all. neither is izanami. you can 2 man both of them easily.
---
you know you could've quit right?
---
One thing i will say, Once you have what you desire from the exotic loot table. you lose the purpose of playing the game. due to how undesirable and under powered a lot of exotics are. 
---
Nice now cheesing riven just got a whole lot easier 
---
Probably because we didn't give them any dawning gifts :(
---
Don‚Äôt forget ClapTrap
---
For the emblem Im guessing? lol 
---
I still think shaxx best destiny character but Titan boi best boi
---
ikr, slightly infuriating 
---
Makes sense. Thank you. 
---
Can't for the life of me fathom why they didn't just make it work and sound like a regular Fallen Shrapnel Launcher instead of what it is now.
---
QB is basically 1:1 a Wire Rifle, sooooo... ???
---
What is guided game?
---
The only reason I'd AFK in the Forges would be to farm the papers (you can get them even off of failed ignitions).  That said I'd equip a bunch of gear that dropped my power to 100 or less so it would match me by myself and nobody gets screwed.  Screw this guy.
---
Dang never got to the end where it shows the players
---
Amen brotha
---
Oh yeah i forgot about the extra dmg to taken. Well i guess thats a extra motivation to finally do the quest haha. Thanks for reminding me!
---
Would be a cool wallpaper for sure! 
---
Isn't it dude?  But $80 for an hour and a half is just too much.
---
Dawnblade ‚Äúdoes better,‚Äù but only because at least one person with Well and Lunafaction boots is needed for the first 3 encounters.    You also need it to cheese Riven, so if you‚Äôre the only warlock on the Fireteam, that‚Äôs 4 out of 6 encounters you will be asked to use Dawnblade with Lunas.   I can very confidently say that last wish cannot be done without one warlock filling that role (master race).   
---
Personally, if I‚Äôm not the only warlock, I will ditch Well after the first encounter to run Control.  I‚Äôm a WARlock not a riftlock.   You can effectively do damage with Geomags that no other class can.   Throw on a tractor cannon, and not only are you supporting the Fireteam, you are surviving boss foot stomps, etc while doing more damage than anyone else.   
---
Yup! Appreciate the effort tho. 
---
There is 2 sprites tailing the right side of ship near back. At first thought was lenses flare but it's not. Someone didn't cut/copy/paste with finesse from their ship clip art folder..that's all..minor quality gripe. I work in QA and for awhile this has bugged me..since I got the ship
---
Not really actually I need a different roll if I wanna cluster bomb riven
---
#GUYS OP HAS A HORSE SHOE UP HIS ASS
---
&gt;All I said was it was impossible to do at his PL. 
---
Not quite. What you said was:
---
&gt;Impossible,  do you even pay attention to power level requirements.  Stop being stupid 
---
Aside from the word "Impossible", everything else you said was entirely unnecessary. 
---
And don't act like this is a first time for you. There's no personal beef. I'm just pointing something that you've done a hundred times before. 
---
Don't even bother arguing this point, because you know I'm absolutely right. 
---
O.o          No........just..........no.
---
A) might wanna say what u are actually using
---
B) the opponents were awful 
---
C) all but 1 or 2 of ur kills were fusion or melee....so...ya
---
I didn't know Fenchurch and Tess were related, I think now knowing that, it paints a beautiful picture.
---
People who played D1 Rise of Iron know what i talk about lol.
---
I didn't play D1, no console.
---
Kewl! I have the og d1 iron banner hunter, vog titan and oryx warlock. Got all three for ~45 quid. Reeeeeealy wanted saladin but it was 45 quid again just for him so i said pass... :(
---
Guess I'm finally going back to that helmet
---
I think the legendary armor u get from the cryptarch can too 
---
they are. a thanatonaut made the mask
---
I liked the original...wish there was chainmail type armor for the titan.
---
Man look at all the cool ones i can‚Äôt get 
---
Don't get me started on jumping, warlock and whisper of the worm quest. Five fucking hours, FIVE!
---
Were you at the edz yesterday?
---
Leukemia

How the fuck is it bragging? It‚Äôs easy to get lol.
---
Ffs....this meme isn‚Äôt going away for a long time lol
---
Yeah they make you work to find that square button
---
Shards are terrible and inconsistent. Hope for the gwisin vest
---
Big oof
---
Made me laugh
---
Same could be said about mountaintop
---
People don‚Äôt use it right. It‚Äôs a melt weapon. If you kill 1 weak as with a burst it shoots double projectiles for the rest of the clip. If used correctly it‚Äôs a beast, but it‚Äôs definitely not a popular weapon towards end game. 
---
This is why they need to disable fucking teammate collision
---
That happen to me once also, lol I was dead af. üòÇ
---
Nah m8 this rocket launcher is used almost exclusively for the last wish riven boss cheese. Putting a taken spec on it does more damage to riven.
---
They do, 
---
Scuf so yeah hair trigger I will definitely try taking it off and see 
---
Gotcha. Still haven't done any raids except for the first one got away from the game after coo and have been leveling myself up probably gonna do lfg for it. D1 grabbed me by the nuts and didn't let go. Still need my ikelos though and tractor cannon though :(
---
My condolences.
---
I just posted it because I think that its cool that it looks like my character isn't wearing an emblem
---
That is the roll Ive been using to cheese riven since day one. Works fine, Im always near the top of Dps numbers 
---
With year 1 weapons that‚Äôs possible but with y2 weapons they come with locked masterworks.  I ended up choosing the second one because I watched some videos and decided it was the best one I had
---
Dreaming city or raid cloak all day! Maybe scatterhorn for the steampunk folks out there.
---
So you just torture yourself....whatever floats your boat.

Haha yeah a bunch of my clan have done so for the same reason XD

You don‚Äôt necessarily need tractor cannon.   Ikelos is a staple for many dps strategies though.   
---
And another after that...
---
What's the third perk? Whirlwind?
---
I find it glitches if I have a bow as my energy and I am using Quickfang. In third person the cloak is gone. I kind of love it though.
---
I feel bad man. I wish there was a triumph for Gambit that was for solo queuers.

Looks amazing

Is this for whisper or the catalyst? I thought you could only get whisper on weekends...

Why just voicelines? Add Danny Devito as the next hunter vanguard
---
That hurt just to watch

I still have a bugged offering that doesnt gi away endless chests to farm those enhanced armor perks

The visor on the D1 hunter helm from IB with the pattern on it was fucking awesome.

I don't think u/iSWINE meant literally, "own". Activision doesn't own Bungie, but they do own all [publishing rights](http://documents.latimes.com/bungie-activision-contract/) until mid 2020 with certain ... *milestones* set in place. Developer-distributor relationship is not a one-way affair. So in a sense, Activision "owns" Bungie, as in... *Bungie is Activision's bitch.* Just thought I'd throw that out there, so I can join you in downvote land.

Ever notice the shadow that it casts?
---
Which shadow?
---
For the weapon itself, as far as I know its avalible from Friday until the reset
---
Right or getting added in to a match where everyone left already so you can lose your streak as a solo?
---
Fuck off. 
---
Congrats doe.
---
Having just gotten into Destiny 2, I really wish a destiny 1 port would come along so I can experience the first game.
---
I don't expect something like that but it's definitely a dream.
---
I‚Äôve got that sparrow over 10 times in my career...it gets more disappointing every time.
---
His ‚Äúburial‚Äù ground shadow, if ya tilt your head looks like Caydes head/horn
---
My heart just sank watching that
---
I use it for heavy ammo finder
---
Carried 3 malificent quests, 1 eater of worlds and 4 nightfalls with no aspiration of getting a exotic as they don‚Äôt drop. I just enjoy helping. A light at the end of the tunnel would be nice. At the moment exotics are Grimm not exciting
---
Aargh! Wish id had known earlier today, had the day off!
---
I wouldn‚Äôt waste my time with it in PvE but in PvP just use your meta weapons and you‚Äôll do just fine. 
---
PC
---
which is a shame as i love the idea of a pike battle but she is much to strong when it comes to damage as it mostly insta kills em
---
thank you!
---
wonderful answer
---
Okay... so I use one eyed mask and nova warp and void blades, they are overpowered. I‚Äôm saying that no matter what Bungie does there will always be overpowered things, unless it‚Äôs year 1 again and everything is boring. I‚Äôm also saying that because of the game it‚Äôs always going to be unbalanced and they should try to make the game as balanced as possible by making sure the comp playlist doesn‚Äôt start with an unfair advantage to one team.  And you may not like to play wait an extra couple minutes instead of playing a 4v3 but I‚Äôm sure most people grinding for Luna‚Äôs or not forgotten, solo, would prefer to have an equalish as possible chance to win that game. It‚Äôs the same thing with a team of 4 random against a 4 stack although that‚Äôs more necessary depending on the number of people in que. 
---
How do I get this weapon? Some quest? Or random drop? 
---
Targeting adjuster for a little bit of range
---
Congratulations! I'm still working on my 5 resets.
---
Happy cake day!
---
HA
---
Nice!!! Even though it‚Äôs not a super great weapon I still really enjoy using it, especially if I‚Äôm just running around doing public events and whatnot. 
---
It's a Lord Shaxx quest you can pick up from him. Dude its a very long quest. 
---
It's a crucible quest. Pretty lengthy, but doable. Just look up Redrix's Broadsword on Google and you'll find the quest steps.
---
Question: do both guardians need them equipped to do the action- or could you walk up to a level 3 kinderguardian and succeed in a high five? I presumed the first as no one would do it with me but maybe it‚Äôs actually the second and just hard as hell to do
---
Not going to lie, I eqipped the emote to try to fist bump back another guardian. It comes off as a really dick move lol. Super awkward!
---
Thanks man! I'm burnt from that grind, but I made it happen. I took advantage of this week triple rank.
---
Yup that's the issue I ran into. Luckily I had someone with me who knew what was going in. Lol
---
Yes, I am aware of that bug, but didn't want to overcomplicate it by saying there's a rare bug that causes offerings to not go away when used. 
---
True, altough it's a reskin from D1
---
I think it means it‚Äôs ours. Like for us guardians 
---
Lmao....I laughed so hard just now on my stream....that was some funny shit.
---
Well it went like this: Rise of Iron was about the Iron Lords. The first "guardians". They had no ghosts yet.
---
Saladin and Efrideet (who you meet in the same DLC as the new Iron Banner vendor) are the last survivors of them. Some nanotechnology with the ability to replicate and enhance anything, went loose from a lab made by Clovis Bray from Mars (Yes the same company who made Rasputin) and it became quickly a disease. Almost like a Virus. I can't remember everything from memory, but the Iron Lords (around 8 without Saladin, correct me if i'm wrong) were on a mission to fight off this disease. It is called SIVA. We still have no idea what it stands for.
---
However, while Saladin was fighting off enemies (Fallen) in a hallyway, the rest of his team was getting succumbed by SIVA. And Rasputin actually closed the said room to protect himself. That's why Zavala is extremely sceptic about him. Saladin got locked out and Jolder inside the said room fused a bomb to kill off SIVA once and for all.
---
That happend ~300 years ago.
---
In the present you get a call from Saladin and you have to reach the Vostok observatory which became a new social place in D1. And in D2 it became a crucible map. You can see the iron temple from the map.
---
Turns out the Fallen plundered the bunker and set SIVA free. Your job was to help Saladin fight SIVA back and destroy it for good. In the end of the campaign you go to the replication chamber and fight off.... The Iron Lords. One by one. They are were still alive, but mutated. And they did [not look pretty](https://sm.ign.com/t/ign_de/screenshot/default/destiny-siva_hn2u.1920.jpg)

Negative. Was in gambit pretty much all day before running EP then loafing in Lost Oasis.

If this is for the forge quest, you can do it solo. Just need to go slow and be careful you don‚Äôt die because if you do it annoyingly brings you back to orbit.

for one to brag about something, one can simply possess something others don't

We have a discord and a handful of us are always talking destiny on there. But we have 80+ members and always have max clan rank

Icarus grip and firmly planted kinda counter act each other

---
Oh god, why?!?!?

Dm me the discord link
---
That happened to me yesterday. I got sad af. BUNGO PLZ FIXS TH1S BU11SH1T!!!!!!!!
---
Certain melee attacks do more damage, ie a Titan shoulder charge will one hit kill you every time. In general a regular melee should take 2 hits to kill assuming they are one after another, even at full health. The best counter for this is to carry a shotgun and swap to it in tight areas. And no melee is not affected by where it hits, only by your class melee ability when it's charged. 
---
This is also how it feels putting charges into the Blind Well 
---
470 light?
---
Rampage spec is actually a pvp perk on this gun. The point is to reload right after a kill and have extra 1 second of rampage to be able to 2 tap people.   
---
Without the rampage spec you don't have as much time to do it.
---
Got mine this morning and haven‚Äôt taken it off since.   Rampage spec is good because it extends the time and allows you to overlap with kill clip.   Not really any mod that benefits the roll as much.    
---
So does moving target ‚Äúincreased speed and target acquisition when moving while ads‚Äù
---
Was this a joke post
---
That happens a lot. At first I thought that's how he was supposed to die. Glad he's kinda fixed but that shit does still happen.
---
Wym?
---
Yeah I made a new titan character. 
---
Yeah but it‚Äôs kind of situational and very unforgiving weapon to use.  I still feel the others I listed are superior, I really wish the redrix had way better handling. Dang gun seems to take forever to Ready and aim 
---
I hate when people do this. 
---
This is fake. Everybody knows that you dont even get matched with other guardians in the gofannon forge

---
Great meme but pretty frustrated rn no one in my clan or in lfg wants to help me get a whisper because with forsaken and whatnot no one wants to help me and I don't have money to buy forsaken and it's just so frustrating. 
---
Its worth the grind.  Just got mine this morning with kill clip, rampage, and flared magwell.   I have gaunlets with enhanced hc loading and can confidently say the only legendary that would make me take it off is the EP sg, and if I ever get a curated threat level, even the EP sg won‚Äôt be able to replace it.  
---
It's rough. When I take breaks to play on my PC and come back it takes a while to adjust to such a claustrophobic experience.

Oh wow, that's intense!

Who‚Äôs that character on the bottom left? Looks like a cool dude...

more like ***E***

Alright, you are right. Asking for a Sherpa is totally okay. But how many Sherpas are there to help out inexperienced players? It would be "more convenient" and faster if a new player would find a forming team themselves. Players should take initiative to get the things they want done and not bank on good players to come to them. 
---
I sherpad a team today for Leviathan. It was my first time Sherpa-ing and we had a good time getting the first standard. But because these new players did not understand the mechanics well, we kept wiping and wiping and wiping and wiping. I did my best to switch roles or give words of encouragement but after 40 minutes of trying, 2 guys left one after the other. The fireteam leader LFGd but we got a troll instead who kept shooting the dog with the crystal. We then kicked him after 3 tries and we got players with no mics or not willing to hop on discord without saying anything.
---
I felt bad. We spent an hour of our time trying to get the raid done. I could feel my teams frustration when getting uncooperative randoms and the time they wasted hoping they get their first ever midnight coups. In the end, we disbanded and nothing but the first castellum encounter was done.
---
I understand this is my first experience Sherpa-ing that ended poorly and others experience may be better. But, I feel that seeking out forming teams stand a better chance. I LFGd alot in my first 2 weeks of raiding. Yes, there were new teams and veteran teams and it was a fun experience. The jokes, the memes, the childishness and funny strats. But I found great people to raid with because of that instead of praying someone would join my call for help.
---
I don't think I'm gatekeeping. But I do agree I should not have said entitled. What I mean is for players to look for help instead of expecting others to come teach them. Same irl, if you don't have the initiative to study or work, no one will come help you or even if people do help, they have great limitations.
---
Thanks for your feedback and I would edit my post promptly.
---
Really? I should have done it earlier.
---
I just assume it does by your post but I think I have assumed wrong...
---
Bruh have you not heard of Luna‚Äôs/NF, Ikelos SG, or Mindbender‚Äôs? All in the energy slot and none of them are even exotics, meaning you can use them and still have an Ace, Tractor Cannon, or Black Talon. But yes, Telesto is broken because it can do what, exactly? 
---
I'm sure something can be done about that. Try the Prodigal set for starters, I have the chest and gauntlets from that set here
---
Oh. Lol! I just got to finish this. The grind was very long. 
---
Whisper is definitely the best weapon for the bosses IMO, though that obviously doesn't help for your first clear.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm just now working on my auto kills then I‚Äôll have mine completed 
---
Yes.  PC.
---
Only mine can be upgraded and isn't a licensed service in a box PC.
---
Whats the one on the most left row and 6up from bottom? And the one 1right to it
---
I was using it the other day. It's insane. Close to 100 stability with the catalyst.
---
no joke lmao
---
Had this same thing, but it was jumping on the outside wall. It teleported to the correct location though.
---
*sigh* I'm happy for you... any enhanced perks on those
---
2nd row 4 from the bottom what‚Äôs that one? I know every other one but that one 
---
If the textures were updated to fit D2's graphics, I don't think that'd count as lazy, considering there are daily "Remember how cool D1 armor was" posts. I'd personally love to have my wolf head cloak back from D1 Iron Banner.
---
The end mission dialog fitted so well too.
---
And so did everybody else 
---
Don‚Äôt complain, I fucking wish it would do that for my dreaming city badge, that damned ghost shell has had me waiting for months
---
No lmao. It lasts until the end of the Season of the Forge
---
what are you, a dust rock hunter? get that outa here. OEM is the only thing that makes titans on console viable in competitive.
---
I use it with metro shift, looks pretty good. For me atleast
---
The same could be said for those who never go to the bank. 
---
Because in the moment you don't think about the one item in the entire game that is like this. 
---
That said, I don't get why this keeps getting posted. I've made the mistake and got disappointed, but never bothered to post it. But that's probably because I realize after picking it up I'm an idiot for getting my hopes up. 
---
That's why. I dont know if it's a bug but it did it to me kn my warlock and hunter but my titan could do them because he had them unlocked. I hope bungie does something about it and dont make us do these grindy quests on all three characters 
---
That is either a hint or they hust program everyone on the otherside of the glass to be enemies
---
I am coming up on my 8th reset. I have only done 2 games with clan mates. Soloing is not so bad. 
---
Not gonna lie, hunting the Barons felt tedious. But otherwise great campaign. :)

Yeah, almost all of my games were solo

Had a match tonight where he gave us the victory but the score was 125-125. Weird. 
---
&gt;he solid black one

OH damn thank you very much, I just need to learn how to get that now!, hopefully they let it stay like that or at least bring out a solid black one.

Why fuck queenbreaker? Thats a random drop bud

We can coexist, good sir- Telesto and FL are my go-tos for pvp. There‚Äôs nothing more satisfying than getting a double all because you know how to bounce a ball around a cornerüôèüèº
---
that‚Äôs means you are 1 kill closer. keep going. it‚Äôll go up exponentially as you get better and more familiar with the gun. I suggest rumble and go and kill steal
---
Thanks, and no problem. Oddly enough, I played the beta on PS4 and it‚Äôs still in my collections. I was able to equip it previously and it would work, but now it‚Äôs just black whenever I do.
---
Same. Keep your eyes peeled for the Distribution perk on boots. It does all abilities at a higher rate than the regular ones. Their basically my exotic boots.
---
If this happened, I would come back to Destiny.
---
Better idea, petition to have them made into new vehicle type "Hummingbird" 
---
That wall is taking a helluva beating!!
---
It doesn't go above 100. No perk breaks the 100 cap in D2. Character or Weapon wise. Unless they changed it recently which I doubt.
---
I personally don't feel like these players were "given" NF, they had to have put in the time on the grind. Sure, the matchmaking system for comp isn't ideal, but that doesn't mean that the players who have NF got it for any less effort than anyone else would have to put in.
---
Sorry, that might've been me playing Gambit for the first time.

How about you shut the fuck up
---
I feel your pain. I made a post very similar to yours 1 year ago. Things just dont change.

Calm is the key here. first you'll need a good, precise hand cannon. you can farm trust in gambit, better devils in crucible or duke44 in pve (if you have the new dlc kindled orchid i'm told is a good drop) . masterwork it if you can and the masterwork is good (basically anything except handling will help you ).
---
 Now, take it easy. do some pve and familiarice yourself with your gun. remember that hand cannons are much more potent if you take your time aiming and you space your shots to account for recoil. 
---
Then go to crucible and always GO FOR THE HEAD. you don't want to kill them. you want to headshot them if they die  great, if not you are getting the practice you need for using the hand cannons correctly and get those kills.  you can do it, we belive in you.
---
Seconded, but only if we can rename it as the "Reef Narwhal"
---
Waste for one kill? I super 4-5 times a match.
---
If you get a kill, it's not a waste. If you whiff, it's a waste.

It's the Ennead Emblem, obtained by talking to all 9 of the Dreaming City cat statues and offering up a small gift.

Tell your teammates and yourself to practice your jumpshots more often then, because the only way you auto-pick a ball is if it's already been thrown and missed. Any other ball you have to hold the "action" button

Yeah lemme coach the randoms I was match made work.

An invader? Let me stand out in the open with 15 motes

Just saying. U act like it's a random occurrence and I'm telling you why and when it happens

Sorry humor isn't your strong suit. Happy New Year. 
---
I just feel that telesto is low hanging fruit and a crutch for the lesser skilled players. DARCI, Ace, Whisper, Merciless, and Sturm all require a learning curve to master and skill to execute, with merciless being a so so weapon. Just because it‚Äôs an exotic doesn‚Äôt mean it should do more damage than its peers in the same archetype (rate of fire) needles that attach is good enough. I‚Äôm happy to see the incoming ‚Äúnerf‚Äù coming soon though. 
---
I love humor. I laugh more often than most. It's just I like to laugh at funny things, that's all
---
Hahahaha nope because thats all people use
---
Back in his day, banshee was nightmare fuel for all the enemies of humanity. He was a warrior when he was human and when he became a exo, rasputian didnt alter his programing
---
There some stuff I found out lately for the first time paying attention to some lore. During the strike for malefeance when you come to the end and hear the audio of the guardian being shot I always assume it was someone with a golden gun. And then I recently got the ace of spades and one of cayde cache he mentioned "hiding from him" and his Golden gun. And if you read the lore for malefeance there is also a mention of out shooting "him" who that is I don't know but I feel like more will be revealed in the next expansion

Nothing. The radius is already capped so nothing will come of it

Yeeessssssss

I really enjoyed the campaign of this game, right in the feels 
---
I wish I had a big booming clan like yours.

I always wondered, is there a kind of sparrow that can better ram enemies? There is one that will attract less attention from enemies
---
YES

No one gives a flying fuck what true vanguard thinks.

Uhh no he clearly made a joke bud
---
Ok

We do. Chronologically, that adventure is done before the leviathan arrives at Nessus. Calus is the emperor in question. 
---
I swear to God watch the queen actually die
---
Post something like this when you've done 46 Last wish completions without One Thousand Voices. And have done The Ascendant Challenge, and The Weekly story mission in the dreaming city every week since it was released and not gotten the ghost or sparrow. 
---
This is my current situation. I'm not completely done with the game, I dont feel like it's a waste of my time. I've gotten a lot of enjoyment out of it. But I have to say, it's definitely had an effect on how much more I want to play. I come back every week and do all of my activities and get squat of what I want.
---
Don't get me wrong. I have almost every forsaken exotic, and I should be happy with my luck. but, that's coming from someone that has played 8-18 hours a day since forsaken Launch. I've played the hell out of the game, and that's why I have all that.
---
 I hardly touched the game this week. May take a small break from it.
---
It's like matchmaking for raids, but you queue in as either a guide to or a seeker and the guides help the seekers finish the activity. It's available for Nightfall, Last Wish, and Scourge of the Past rn
---
If you are on Playstation you can change your clock to not get instanced with other people, not sure if this works for fireteams (i imagine so) or other platforms
---
That isn‚Äôt a thing. 
---
The boost makes you lvl 30 and skips all campaigns except forsaken.
---
I‚Äôd give it the same as your mobility. 
---
It happens.
---
You aren't by any chance using a gun with explosive rounds or payload?
---
I was and it turns out that EP interferes with the headshot so try using one without it.
---
Also the more you play with HC the more you'll get better and headshotting.
---
I can reliably get 90% of my HC shots on head now
---
That... doesn't seem much better. 
---
It's not people like you that a re problem stacking up with friends.
---
It's that the matchmaking will put you and 5 of your friends that are partied up and talking against 6 solo players that have no way to coordinate.
---
It's the matchmaking that's the issue, ignore the salty people that report you for playing with friends. 
---
It was the opposite for me, I really liked the hard piece but tossed it cuz the cape 
---
**If you are talking about the Dungeon:**
---
Unfortunately Bungie had not started queuing for fireteams outside of Crucible/Strikes until this past Halloween event. 
---
BUT...No fireteam needed. There is actually a Triumph for completing the Dungeon Solo without dying. 
---
Although, if you are not attempting this triumph, I recommend a fireteam. There are 4 encounters and each grant a powerful drop. I think the Recommended Power Levels of 560, 580, 590, 600 were shown when I did them the first week the Dungeon was live. 
---
Also, after defeating Vorgeth (the jerkhole Taken Ogre) there is a statue up the steps where you deposit that Exotic Quest item you got from The Spider to gain access to the Dreaming City (Awoken Talisman). By doing so, you start the quest to obtain the Exotic WISHENDER BOW. This bow is needed to destroy the corrupted eggs scattered around the Dreaming City and seen within multiple instances of the Ascendant Realm (including the Corrupted Strike, Ascendant Challenges, the Raid and various locations in the Dreaming City destination). Destroying all the corrupted eggs yields an exotic Taken sparrow and of course Triumphs along the way.
---
Ultimately Week 3 has its own unique source for Powerful Drops, being the Dungeon and if you are still trying level up to 650, highly recommend completion.
---
**If you were asking about the campaign missions available each week:**
---
They yield a powerful drop and noticeably Ghost has had altering dialogue over time (took a month or so to change) and Ghost is getting tired of this Curse. There are also triumphs for doing specific tasks within the missions.
---
 **If you were asking about the Blind Well:**
---
It yields 1 powerful drop each week by completing a Tier 3 with Unstable Charge. If you don‚Äôt have each super unlocked, Blind Well is the key. Also, from personal experience with clan mates, the Blind Well chest‚Äôs powerful drop has seen quite a bit of exotics of the last couple months. Whether they are duplicates or not, they helped with leveling up and infusing them into something doesn‚Äôt cost Enhancement Cores.
---
**Donald Duck wears a towel to not appear completely naked.**
---
When he wears no pants in public it is because he now has a shirt on. Many cartoons only have the character wear a shirt like Winnie the Pooh, Alvin and the Chipmunks, Talespin, Darkwing Duck...who am I kidding this is all Disney cartoons.......
---
I think Zapp Brannigan may be a Disney fan now...
---
Nah no problem. I am lucky enough. I got black talon, those warlock forsaken Nova Warp gloves and yesterday got Queenbreaker and Chaperone. Also got the bow hunter exotic.
---
Pffft hunters

Nah, PS
---
Stopping an enemy team from spawn killing their envoys with a blade barrage/tether is so much more important than getting some health back on the Primeval, you don't even need to kill them to stop them from killing Envoys, the mere presence of you being on their side is enough to make a solo queue team sit back in spawn as all of the Primeval ads spread out behind cover.
---
thanks for your answers. You are are a gentleman and a scholar, sir.
---
Whats your emblem?? 
---
I am seeing Thralls everywhere!
---
Aye
---
Every. Fucking. Time.
---
On the Dreaming City map, there are portals that teleport you from one place to another. If you go in one portal, the the portal you come out of is the Exit portal. 
---
That is where I primarily used it but there are so many better alternatives and lightning rod does not always proc on headshots for some reason
---
There's no such thing as wrong opinion, just different opinion.
---
In the internet we have something called memes
---
For your first time, use Right Side of Wrong (solar pulse rifle) to deal with the taken captains. Then, in the second room, have someone else equip a void weapon to break wizard and acolyte shields. I don't recommend shotguns just yet because enemies hit really hard. Even though I'm at 630 PL. For the last room, run arc weapons to break centurian shields. I also suggest running snipers and Go Figures to burst down the final bosses health. You can run up the slope at the entrance to snipe the bosses from a safer and higher vantage point. 
---
As for supers, split between solar and void sipers for the first 2 rooms. Everyone should change to arc to clear the adds in the final room. Then if possible, change up your super for optimal DPS.
---
If you need help though, you can pm me and I'll help you and your friends.
---
"Wuaw" -owen wilson.
---
Some one said counterbalance no Rampage Spec obviously. I have 68 Gofannon completions and yet received that role. Always put Rampage Spec on anything with Rampage if you don‚Äôt believe me slap one on a Breakneck. You will never have another opinion. Save counterbalance for Blast Furnace That has some wobble. However you are going too notice the recoil on the Kindled Orchid is consistently the same.
---
As a hunter I can confirm
---
bruh what is this...
---
it happened to me 7 times in total...I know the feeling bruh
---
People sassing Blade Barrage users. Is it really that much more annoying than getting killed with Spectral Blades?
---
Because the people who join are low light levels
---
Low level mean it's harder for them
---
Whilst you're a higher light level it's easy and you die less

I got it out of nowhere when i was in the matchmaking. 
---
Yes please
---
Your very late.. All this stuff was already posted as soon as the Annex was added into the game prior to Black Armory releasing.
---
[removed]
---
yeah supers and abilities carry over but ammo resets to the same amount after each round
---
Update: two matches later it appeared again. Killed it this time
---
Anyone know how to get the warmind/rasputin emblem in the 8th column 7th row?
---
Loco! Por si no te dieron respuesta aun: cada vez que haces el whisper en modo heroico, hay un modificador fijo que cambia cada semana (como en asaltos y ocasos) de quemadura xxxxx.. En quemadura de arco, el arco hace mucho mas da√±o (tanto el que haces como el que te hacen). Lo mismo para solar y vac√≠o.
---
Al completarlo te dan una nave genial!
---
Hahaha
---
and nova warp... and spectral blades... and blade barrage... and shoulder charge... and shotguns... and luna/nf... did i miss anything?
---
I know this is wrong because of Roadborn. Though maybe that‚Äôs an exception. 
---
Nice shot, but damn did you get baited. xD
---
:D
---
So you died.
---
Yeah that will affect your KD
---
Yeah I got one the other day and was like...huh OK so where's the BBQ? LOL
---
Yeah they need to rework it. Possibly create a mechanic where the third match is one where the primeval and envoys are summoned and both teams need to finish it off first to win.
---
love it
---
How about having a guardian ride on the back of the sparrow and shoot? Now that would be some intense SRL
---
secreta our: After baking another cooky, she won't be Satan
---
wait,so ,if it accidently touches ANYTHING,it blows up???
---
Super mods? Shards? Or are you just way way better than me?
---
0! You guys will struggle to top that
---
Because they always look like the enemy to your team so your own team ends up freaking out and shooting them all the time.
---
Pretty much lol 
---
Aye! Oops my bad, I'm in the wrong line.
---
&gt; Bungie should rework the matchmaking so stacked fireteams can be with other ones or with similarly sized stacks. 
---
I thought they did, I played with soloers against two duo stacks not long ago. /s
---
I did this exact thing.  Thought I had to do the emote also, and ended up both of us standing there with our hands out waiting... And waiting...
---
Appearantly he realized I didn't know, and just high fived me instead.  At least it worked out in the end.  Lol.
---
There is a lot of irony in this comment.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure the fastest u can go with a hunter is bottom tree arc strider stompee5 and Lightweight frame weapon

I can confirm I got another one to drop yesterday on a hand cannon powerful frame forging.

I'm also interested in knowing this

NARWHALS NARWHALS FLYING AS A SPARROW CAUSING A COMOTION COS THEY ARE SO AWESOME!!!!!

I got super stoked that I got The Sixth Coyote, it's the only forsaken exotic I wanted and I love them but those shards have a mega set of perks on them fair play. 
---
No more tentacles for me!

Congrats. Grind got to me yesterday; half way through my fifth reset. Giving it a weeks break and then I‚Äôll finish it off next week.

Strategy. Smart. I just go in guns ablaxing and land solidly in the middle.

Holy crap how many hours do you have?

It's hard being a PVP noob
---
Look it up, its my all time favorite emblem
---
Yeah Im going to try
---
Yes
---
there's no indication that the engine of the game can do that so the answer will be "no answer" so basically a "no"
---
Check out my other comment I just made on this thread 
---
Thank you :P but the credits go to @niristv on instagram
---
I believe it's from someone on Twitter I'm blanking on his name.

It‚Äôs dumb af that‚Äôs the only nightfall I need and hasn‚Äôt been around in ages cause bungie can‚Äôt get anything right not even a nightfall rotation. Sickening

Wat am I posed to be looking at

Perfectly 'balanced' as all things should be
---
He also has a pateron if you're into that. It'll help him to continue creating these and he's also working on a interactive infographics of sorts
---
They can have Colorado. It sucks dick. Fair trade.
---
I much prefer Scooty Puff Sr., "The Deathbringer"!
---
This doesn‚Äôt exist.
---
His guts look dope. 
---
I used my masterworked sturm but idk man
---
They need to make it so the same nightfall can't be in rotation two weeks in a row or something
---
Holy shit! You know what's weird? I saw that locked area in the room before the ascendant realm and was like "wft is this? This is *something*, I know it," but could never figure out what.
---
Thank you!
---
What are we supposed to see here? 
---
What about every warlock super chaos reach, nova warp, nova bomb. Those are all way too op for any crucible event
---
No thanks
---
and another one.
---
What emote is THAT up front?!?! Mace and shield?!?!?!?!?!?
---
Wott was up for two weeks straight.
---
The thing is  you‚Äôre annoyed about an event being over when it was stated even by Bungie the length of the event . There‚Äôs nothing to be annoyed about or at other than yourself for not dumping them before the event ended .
---
Or it's also possible the armor sloane has for you to select is above your currently level as well. But when you view your character you should see your armor on the right and if any of those 5 slots has a yellow or gold item in it then you have an equipped exotic. Doesnt mean anything is wrong just means you can change it of you want. To select another armor piece to equip just put your cursor over the armor piece on the right and a sub menu will popup with an additional 9 slots and then you select another piece of armor you might have picked up since you started the game.
---
When? 10 weeks ago?
---
Your saying that warlocks and hunters don't need an exotic to be op. I got it. 
---
Was already mentioned that it takes too much effort for the amount of player that actually played it more then a few times and I'm of the same opinion.
---
It would be funny for a little while, but making it into something, compareable to Gambit would be a mistake. I would rather have the time spent on more rewards for the Forges/Blind Well/Vendor resets and any other endgame activity.
---
Maybe for Chrimson Days or some other event? 
---
Ah shit man, idk. It was awhile ago. 
---
When did I say any of the things you just mentioned?  Your a moron. 
---
Probably one with a lot of ammo because you need multi-kills.
---
What shader is that?
---
Lol, wait till Anthem drops....
---
I have all the good stuff already :-/
---
Bungalow pls
---
Nice... Full immersive telemetry XD
---
Definitely arc
---
I got this the other day...dont know much about it....worth infusing up?
---
She has the sitting emote, could be why tbh
---
I would say the new shield, you can block a lot of damage, or you can deal a fair amount of damage and stun lock bosses with the bash move, and when you have the shield up and your allies shoot through it there bullets get a damage buff
---
The fact he got double the kills and efficiency of the second best member of his team
---
I didn‚Äôt hit reply so I pointed down Incase it didn‚Äôt say I responded
---
Maybe hammer Titan? Solar definitely has the best DPS out of all of them. That and throwing exploding hammers is pretty fun in my opinion.
---
Witch hunting/calling out players is not allowed on this subreddit. Please have a quick look at the rules before posting in the future, thanks:).
---
GJ, Still trying to get my first 650 :D
---
For a casual.  . . You'll like striker with skullfort
---
Mainly just blade barrage
---
You, sir, are very quick on that information.
---
What does reddit have to do with knowing the dawning event doesnt last forever? 
---
Concept art.
---
Hows hunter hard
---
I've never seen that either, might be a mission or a bug
---
Dawning brilliance on everything except the cloak which is precursor VEX chrome 
---
Aye!
---
And spawning faster, but with a ghost she'll that becomes irrelevant
---
Depending on what exotics you have, go striker with skullfort, sun breaker with hallowfire heart or sentinel with doom fang pauldrons
---
lol that armor... fat hunter lmao
---
Also you can carry more than one exotic in one of those submenu 9 slots I mentioned. You can still select the armor from sloane as long as you have a spot in one of the 9 slots. But if its full you will have to free up a spot by dismantling a piece. To do that put your cursor over the slot to bring up the submenu and then cursor over one of the 9 slots. You might have white armor that is low level so dismantle one of those. I am not sure what key you press to dismantle on PC cause I play on console. But the key will show at the bottom after you cursor over the item.
---
Because we‚Äôre fucking terrible

Title, and I have had the game since November's "download now and keep forever" event. Since then, I have had a consistent and flawless 60 fps up until today when I opened up the game to find it with a jittery and sluggish 6 fps (according to the ingame fps counter). The Dawning event ended today, so I'm not sure if that is coinciding with or causing my problem. I have not changed any settings at all for this to occur. However, I have tried playing with the settings today to see if I could increase my fps and restarting, unfortunately to no avail. I have a i7-4770 @ 3.40GHz and a NVIDIA GTX 1050. Any help would be much appreciated!
---
HA! you said do do :))))))
---
Hell yes!!!
---

---
Looking at your screenshot made me realize - now that the event is over and it's too late - that baking was the most efficient way to get crucible and vanguard tokens too. That's one to grow on.
---
Yea it's me the last two days when i wanted to finish the exotic quest
---
Shit m8 imma have to put that on some other guns. Thank you for sharing your mahogany Breakneck with the world. 
---
Bamboozle denied
---
phoenix not dropped for me yet
---
Agree 100%. I‚Äôve been killed so many times 1-2 seconds after another super is tethered. It also needs to kill guardians on a direct hit. 
---
Looks like rich mahogany. 
---
once you complete the forges it tells you in each forge description which weapon frames go to each (im pretty sure)
---
But it can be done with mouse wheel right?
---
As of right now, it seems like only the bow, Le Monarque, is available. You have a small chance of getting it from any forge. The chance appears to be drastically increased if you complete a powerful weapon frame at that forge, but some players have reported getting that bow without any weapon frames in their inventories. 
---
The sniper frame goes to gorfannon the pulse rifle is inazami and the machine is volundr I‚Äôm getting confused I don‚Äôt know where to look on the internet -_-
---
Yeah, im still climbing to 600+ and realllllly wamt the thunderlord
---
It's that bungie is, as always, showing their titan favoritism by giving them the best of that type of exotic and doing nothing to bring it down to level while the other two classes versions are basically useless
---
Oh I‚Äôve done it before. 
---
Been considering doing it again but I don‚Äôt wanna waste the currency on shaders. 
---
you turned in 5k and got 100 and i turned in 2k and got 12

Bungie keep giving hunters buffs and the best exotics yet they complain the most about not being fully OP and having all the good things from other classes, just fuck off. They're the easiest most versatile most damaging class in the game and you cry because titans have a "one hit melee" they brought back from D1 that can be countered easily with any shotgun  
---
Fuckin Hunters are something else man.
---
For this mission thats the only problem but moving forward its not an issue. Youll get missions as normal. The main campaign is denoted by the cabal symbol and there are adventures on each plant that are shown as an orange shield from the map view. Some of these give skill points which progress your subclass so do those and the others you can skip if you want. Lots to digest but it is a fun game.

Don‚Äôt sleep on the avalanche either, got it on my hunter right now and it‚Äôs pretty great. 
---
So yes
---
I have a similar vehicle called the [Eidolon Bird](https://db.destinytracker.com/d2/en/items/4085575828). Can we just merge these two together?
---
Ehm no, maybe you just really suck with them
---
I got mine about a week after it came out. Don‚Äôt regret the grind at all. Slapped a Rampage spec mod it, hoooooweeeee
---
Banjo plz!
---
Nova Warp can get you through walls and round corners though and it's impossible to get more than a few kills with blade barrage unless they're all lined up together. 
---
I find it really hard to find a good shader for Breakneck that matches the leather strap going around the barrel.. 
---
Mostly just bragging rights between my friends and me
---
Roger that!
---
Infinite knives with six coyote? Lol 
---
Can you do a similar paragraph for titans and warlocks? Ty
---
The exotic bow does not come from the powerful weapon frame. The bow randomly drops in addition to the weapon you got from the powerful weapon frame. 
---
An upvote for effort 
---
Yeah but it's still something
---
They do it to show off their gun. Like a little flex they got a nice roll. 
---
Arcstaff is really good against the primeval because he stuns him and does a lot of damage
---
But they‚Äôll get more seeds if they take it heroic ... like all of the seeds in one heroic . I don‚Äôt get people . Killing the enemy only nets about 11.
---
Thank you. I just discovered that it's still 15 rewards, Heroic Playlist has two.
---
I had one person tell me that you only had to get a high score once in the week to still get the drop chance bonus. Dunno if true
---
Love me a comeback 
---
Boredom be killing me too... literally I be watching netflix as I run around and sometimes to much attention on the netflix then the game lol. I just wanna dick around with the new exotic bow before getting hardcore into monster hunter
---
Oh, so you got killed once by it and think it needs to be nerfed. That's sad.
---
Other supers need to be brought up. Y'all being for nerfs to fun things is why year one d2 crucible was boring as hell. 
---
If you're ahead you want to run so they stay in your zone as long as possible and aren't collecting motes for their team. If you're behind you should power weapon them so you can return to mote hunting 
---
What are the tiny symbols in the Nightfall section above the reward drops?
---
Telesto, if you have it will hammer out those kills in no time 
---
That Warlock wasted time by rez'ing that dude. What a noob.
---
I've been killed by that Hive Knight too many times. But I think putting lower level characters in their own instances would just put more weight on the servers.
---
You should just learn when to use the bow.. It‚Äôs been like this since Destiny 1 and sure it‚Äôs okay to complain about but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs post-worthy. After playing with it for like 2 months in D1 i got used to it and never had a complaint after that, I just always used it in the wrong situations.
---
Fuck you for skating in pvp
---
I just did the forge and a engram dropped and it looks yellow and it was a legendary rocket launcher black Armory themed Do you maybe know why I‚Äôm getting legendary weapons and not the exotic bow when I see that yellow engram drop 
---
I learned that top tree Hammers can kill Nws pretty fast if you get em with the smaller explosions
---
PvP isn‚Äôt even fun right now, at least to me. It‚Äôs just a roll of the dice on how I‚Äôll get one hit killed, or how many enemies are using telesto etc.
---
Didn‚Äôt even bother with banana either, which is an event I usually love.
---
I‚Äôve still got the 40 strikes to complete for that one, but I will do, eventually..  so many good legendary weapons to choose from, the exotic‚Äôs really need to stand out. 
---
Yeah...I did mention handheld, but forgot shoulder charge. I will say that better gear isn't particularly relevant, because you can do well with blues if need be.
---
Ay same tho. It's all Sweet Business and Anonymous Autumn for me.
---
What are you on about? Nova Bomb is extremely weak as a super and imo Blade Barrage is much stronger and versatile than Chaos Reach as a super. Chaos Reach can be hard to aim and is slower to get out than BB. Plus, you know, Shards is a thing. This coming from a hunter main btw.
---
It will count don‚Äôt worry
---
3 individual deaths.
---
Why does the speed change so much? 
---
I prefer Hammerhead myself. Couldn't get a good feel for Avalanche. 
---
I can't be the only one that doesn't have a problem with one eyed mask users, right? Unless it's mainly a pc thing (I'm on xbox)
---
Exept when i get it.. when i get it the map seems to be devoid of enemies and i dont get shit
---
If they were green they were weapon telemetries. If not I have no idea. 
---
that is good because I will likely fall to 0 Elo shortly after 
---
Just shoulder charge them? 
---
AYE!
---
If you‚Äôre running the arc subclass then I‚Äôd say Crown of Tempest would be better. It gives you more towards your super as well as more energy towards your grenade, melee, and rift.
