It was titan meta but it wasn‚Äôt 6 titans in trials, in fact it just proved how busted solar subclasses were at the time

I roast marshmallows at every fire I light in IB no matter what the score is and I always use my ‚Äúloves‚Äù heart you emote at opposing guardians once I kill them. Been trying to get blow a kiss since launch, haven‚Äôt had it since D1 and it breaks my heart.
---
But the numbers line with with the health bar...? What?
---
Raid, iron banner, and anything pinnacle should be high Stat drops. That, combined with mods should help you get the build you want
---
You can't get a recluse in iron banner?
---
The armor elements void/solar/arc are used to help you resist the elements that are used against you in pvp and pve. The numbered stats are for abilities/mobility/strength/defense which you can mix and match to your liking. If you hover over the stats next to your character it'll tell you the cooldown for each of your character's abilities as you apply your armor. You can also apply mods to improve cooldowns even further. I'll try to find you a guide
---
You still have to do the other encounters but if you do all the encounters and then load back on you will be at Calus
---
You stop that. Stop it now
---
It's in the game for a reason, don't feel bullied out of using it.  In my experience, oem &amp; saint 14 = same pvp performance, unless the player is really really good.  In which case, oem will destroy people.  Also, there's no chivalry or moral dilemmas no matter what you do as long as you're not cheating.  Play the game, have fun, get a couple cheese covered kills then get killed yourself.  Again, f*** being bullied over a silly game, you're better then that.  Go ahead, downvote me to the core cause I'm not on the hate train.  Chooo chooo
---
As we have called that in my clan since forsaken, the fl*shlight....
---
Seriously. How would you even DDOS such a small aspect of the game without causing issues elsewhere. I don't think OP actually knows what DDoS really is.
---
OP is a genius and funny AF
---
People still bitching about that?  Especially after Bungie said they're going to fix it?  Sad.
---
There are 140 with public profiles
---
He said, as he retaliated to the explanation of the joke post.
---
Starting at the mini Rasputin statue thing near the NPC lady, I killed everything from there up to the top. I ran back down and nothing else spawned. I sound about 5 years old from that explanation, sorry.
---
*gets a green from an Exotic*
---

---
Ngl though the RNG must've been HORRIBLE for that to happen
---
Ok and what‚Äôs that have to do with my response? He wanted to ‚Äúgo back to how it was‚Äù but it was useless blues then after hours of playing maybe a useless legendary? How is that better?
---
I have killed everything, nothing else spawns even if I run back down to the bottom again.
---
Best DLC evar! Make that silver rain
---
Implying that rewards used to be good? Because they weren‚Äôt. You got literally nothing for hours of play before, the only thing worth anybody‚Äôs time in the old drop system was raiding.
---
They are called vaults and they got done blowed up.
---
There was a cap at 100k but now it‚Äôs 250k
---
People telling me wait for the restart and earn extra glory
---
You cant get glory in IB. You can get progress for the victories though. 3% for survival, 5% for IB. Imo, IB is more fun and time efficient.
---
*crashes into a wall*

I think so, if not you can use one of the 10 black armory weapons you need to make to get it

---
Idiot question. Whats the difference between the two?
---
Yesterday i punched a strike titan while he was in super, with my bare fists and killed him, then did it again a couple of games later. LL advantage is great in banner
---
Well press F1,equip the solar super ability (that is bound to F). Now,whenever you kill somene with it,the quest will gain completion. There might be a change grenades count too,but I'm not sure
---
If you know what you're doing with spider you can abuse glimmer pretty easily.
---
# Five raid banners!
---
Honestly I think its hacking. Since New Light, I've witnessed 2 clear hackers. 1 teleported all around the map and killed the other team as soon as they spawned. The other was just auto-headshotting everyone.
---
Never saw any before that.

---
There is no quest for ornaments, you had to have gotten those way back in season 3&amp;4
---
Both Warlocks and Hunters hate the shoulder charge, OEM using, Striker using, shotgun using Titans so I guess really we all hate each other for a reason but then when it's on OUR side.... story is very different/s
---
Nope, random roll. Then later in the season pass you unlock it's drop chances in activities like strikes, gambit, and crucible.
---
Same goes for the LMG.
---
Alright i wasn't sure if supers counted
---
Nice dude I just one recommendation have us hunter mains standing on a falling titan. Lol
---
*shows video of it happening*
---
Yeah nothing new, the guns use hit-scan the fire animation and 'bullet' Thad travels is just a visual effect
---
Their missing a firewatch of some kind, or a fire extinguisher
---
No? There is no collection with shadowkeep
---
Maybe spend less time dancing and more time working in that aim. /s
---
Interesting, I never would have guessed those were for resists! So I‚Äôm guessing kind of a spread amongst the three instead of focusing on one on the armor is best? Or have sweets covering each depending on the situation. I am not close to worrying about raids at this point, just don‚Äôt want to lose the forest for the trees.
---
the more i play destiny, the less i remember that he was even a character in the destiny universe
---
For this very season yup, unless thundercoil remains next season.
---
You didn‚Äôt get DDoSed
---
What's coming this next week?
---
This answered my question!! Thank you!
---
Yea. No. Idk
---
I don‚Äôt remember which ones for certain but I‚Äôve gotten like 4 that have required me to play crucible for like 2-3 hours (sometimes per step). And yeah they are easy just so time consuming, even when I‚Äôm playing iron banner and usually finishing top 2 on my team. Am I doing something wrong? I‚Äôve watched some guide videos and the content creators all say that it‚Äôs easy too but I‚Äôve been doing everything they say and it just takes forever
---
To ghaul.
---
link?
---
Can you still get the Solstice armor or was that a limited time event?
---
Bungie : those emotes have been disabled
---
Still nothing.  Perhaps it is glitched.  Thanks bud I'll try later.
---
Gotcha, thank you
---
The actually good stuff in PvE (bubble, sunbreaker) aren't getting nerfed.
---
It‚Äôs the special weapon. It‚Äôs Breyer our meaning that you can‚Äôt use it. Currently, it‚Äôs disabled due to a bug that gives you your super extremely quick.
---
That would actually be super useful! Especially for the Rat King‚Äôs Crew quest and I‚Äôm stuck on the last step for the Thorn. PM me and I can send u my PSN
---
Yes, now get 2000 bow headshot kills while the enemy holds all three points while wearing a chicken mask.
---
It‚Äôs literally impossible to get to 960 this season. There aren‚Äôt enough pinnacle drops even with perfect slot RNG.
---
Explodes like a rocket launcher, uses special ammo. Aim, shoot, guaranteed kill. What's the counter? Oh wait, there isn't
---
according to the TWAB, they're tuning the bottom tree dawnblade kills. I don't know if it's a buff or nerf, in all honesty - we'll have to wait and see.
---
Ran 3 for the weekly and got 0 drops. Nothing at all....
---
It traces you. So no
---
Dodge the massive explosive aoe as well huh
---
Took me a while to get the 2nd pic.
---
Then a step to the right
---
Hol up. What's that symbol below the void symbol on your "fake telesto"?
---
Depending on the class and subclass, there are some really good mobility options, specifically for Hunter and Warlock. 
---
All hunters have their dodge which makes it easy to slide around a corner and quickly retreat. They also have Stomp-335 which increases their mobility even more. (Stomp-335 are top tier for PvP)
---
Top tree Dawnblade for warlock has the ability Icarus Dash in which they double tap crouch in midair and do a dash in the direction the are pressing. Much like a midair Hunter dash or twilight Garrison from D1. 
---
A controller with paddles definitely helps, but only once you've learned to use it better than you can use a regular controller. It's gonna take some time. Map awareness also huge when it comes to your confidence "holding forward"
---
That's not the issue, because I've had to use that to keep Destiny 2 active while in game, and not have it switch back to Desktop. Fortnite does it properly just fine, but Destiny 2 is the only problem.
---
Yeah we good right now. One thing I would like is arc strider getting maybe a slight speed buff in crucible. I just hate people out running me. I wish it was like striker titan where I can teleport and spam right bumper.

I seen that next to my 3rd toon that I havent touched yet, my 1st thought was it's a complete waste of money. I've been doing 2 toons at the same time and my hunter has been leveling up rather quickly because my titan was 930 ish when I started. Now my hunter is 947 within 5 days and only half way through the campaign. Titan is 945
---
If you mean by killing 3 gatelords, no I haven't. That is still a quest I have to do, but I didn't think it was related to shadowkeep.
---
That was me last week on the 2nd bit of GoS (with the sleeping Vex at the pillar).  Only I had ricochet rounds on and it pinged off a wall and started the encounter.
---
Well listening to a game jurno was your first mistake....
---
They didn‚Äôt pull it, just disabled it for the time being.
---
Lol dont use cheats ever my dude
---
What‚Äôs an injector?
---
Ah alright.
---
LOL ok so over the last several hours I went through everything I could think over virus scans, checking to make sure drivers and everything were up to date check settings in game and on laptop and like you suggested I power cycled/flushed DNS and tried hooking directly to router with ethernet cable but still I had the same problem... Finally I was thinking about the fact my controller was disconnecting everytime this happen so I put fresh batteries in it and... the problem went away. I feel relieved stupid and aggravated all at the same time
---
r/destinyusernames
---
Not bad! 
---
Here‚Äôs some tips to ‚Äúflesh it out‚Äù!
---
&gt; https://youtu.be/LZc9d97BNdY
---
&gt; https://youtu.be/Na8vixpx328
---
I would say escalation protocal, menagerie, raids, and even iron banner armors are my personal favorites. And then universal ornaments from there
---
I‚Äôll give it to you, if you could be able to do the MountainTop quest, the Randy‚Äôs Throwing Knife quest and do the Redrix‚Äôs Broadsword quest all simultaneously.
---
Hunter bladerthrower flying was far superior, change my mind.
---
I don‚Äôt mean to be rude to the art team but in what world is that a good looking piece of armor.
---
The Chaperone...
---
It was limited.
---
Midair hunter dash?
---
Hug a corner and bait shots.  Use a hight jump.  Hug cover.  Shoot the projectile. There are plenty of counters.  Also. Not a huge aoe.  Jus saying
---
For the escolation set I have to open the chest at the end right because for some reason I think it's bugged for me
---
Bad Juju is definitely worth it with the cata.
---
lol nice one !
---
No problem. AdSense can also be a pain because you can sometimes wait up to three months for your money. They won‚Äôt pay out until you hit a balance of $100, and will sit on anything less for years quite happily ‚Äî when I started using it again I had ~$10 from a previous project 6 years prior still awaiting payment. 
---
They then take a month to pay (2 weeks after the end of the month to ‚Äòverify‚Äô the clicks, and another week or two to pay). So for instance I re-launched VendorEngrams this month, but by the end of the month it won‚Äôt have reached $100 ad revenue. That means it‚Äôll go to next month when it hopefully will, so end of November‚Äôs statement. But that will be processed in December. All that means I won‚Äôt receive money generated this month till about December 20th.
---
What kind of site are you developing, if you don‚Äôt mind me asking? Let me know if you need any help or advice on anything. There is a lot of more knowledgeable community developers, but I have managed to figure a thing or two out.
---
Nah, he just got shotgunned by a titan. It‚Äôs the standard reaction
---
Heh, I remember when it was like 25k or something. Crazy to come back and see 250k now.
---
I'm more shocked by that missed punch tbh.
---
warlock main indeed
---
Last wish
---
Stonk Market crash
---
Kk
---
If you pull the trigger, the projectile fires and detonates on impact with the seekers popping out and doing their thing on impact.
---
If you **hold** the trigger, it detonates when you release the trigger, and the seekers burst out and rain down, and the farther it falls, the more damage it does. So you can sort of use it like artillery in addition to treating it like a run-of-the-mill rocket launcher.
---
I've been playing since season 3 and maining hunter since season 4. Even got a couple of legend ranks under my belt. Honestly, they never were in a bad position from my experience.
---
There is just a lot of things that make hunters strong that are underused, mostly because they're tied to having good pvp skills. For example; dodge would look weak if a player doesn't understand good positioning and map movement yet.
---
I'd go as far to say all the classes are in a good position. Some have more variety than others. Oem and health regen on bottom tree striker made titans just a cut above the rest.
---
Despite that, hunters have been able to keep up due to their excellent neutral game and good supers. We have amazing subclasses for pvp such as; Bottom tree arcstrider, Middle tree arcstrider, Spectral Blades, Top tree Shadowshot, and Blade Barrage.
---
The rest are decent, bottom tree golden gun might need buffs, but I wouldn't say they are as great as those previously mentioned. I'll still be rocking my golden gun in every activity though.
---
I wish they would just tone down the supers in PvP somehow instead of PvE as well. Not sure if they‚Äôve done that in the past but I imagine it‚Äôs not really that easy.
---
He should have jumped off the map to test your loyalty
---
They did in the past, but since Shadowkeep they don't reward any powerful engrams anymore. You can still do them for exp or normal legendaries or just for fun if you want.
---
But sir there are 10
---
Are warlocks severely outmatched in pvp and pve content? Been playing bottom tree voidlock so far (around 850 plevel) but getting a lot of recommendations from clanmates to switch to Titan and Hunter instead, especially for pvp
---
Secondly, are there any other strong Warlock trees I should give a shot? Only other tree I have tried is top tree voidlock
---
Just because it‚Äôs lore is deep dosent mean it can‚Äôt be in game and related to the topic of lore why care about the lore if non of the characters in destiny and any good
---
Thanks for the answer pal, and yeah, since I dont have much more to do I think I'll play them for fun, I only wish they had some score system like strikes so you could challenge yourself in that way, loving the game so far!
---
Jotunn is the nubest shit ever in pvp and yes I'm crying like a bitch
---
Nope, it‚Äôs complete RNG bro.
---
*Implying it takes talent to play destiny*
---
wat
---
It depends on how stupid the other team is. If they just stand around and let it keep chaining, they‚Äôre dead. If they scatter after the first web then they will survive. 
---
I tend to alternate between using pulse and arcbolt grenades; people tend to be stupid and try to walk through a pulse nade, and that keeps the chain going. Arc bolt does more damage instantly though.
---
It‚Äôs complete RNG. This post is incorrect.
---
There's an Overload bow mod, can I use that instead? I don't have Divinity.
---
Tell me about it. I just discovered Xur entirely by accident two days ago.
---
Instructions unclear. Fist stuck in toaster.
---
Do we really need a cap tho I barely ever spent any in d2 even before so had took a forced break after my ps4 stopped accepting disks it would be kinda fun to flex your billions of glimmer if there was no cap tho
---
Where is the tribute hall? I heard you unlock that by opening the chest first
---
Is it possible i have to finish all the blue missions on nessus first?
---
Join Black Fire Crew. We‚Äôve got players on all platforms
---
And calus gets turned on for some reason
---
Exactly! This is sort of my underlying point in this whole discussion. OEM is a constant problem. It's up and running from the first encounter of a match to the last, but supers (on average) happen 2-3 times a match?
---
I mean, it's no excuse for the state they put bottom tree Striker in, but regardless, OEM; to me, is a much bigger issue
---
If they stuck with the ending for the dlc in 3...the only way to unfuck that situation would be time travel.
---
I did 5 damage per headshot with the Traveler‚Äôs Chosen and 27 with the Stubborn Oak. It is literally impossible to get a final blow.
---
did you win
---
It ranks up automatically just by playing the game though...
---
Thank you Guardian
---
welp... then I guess you're done, you should probably read what people want, other than assuming you know what they want instead. You'll help out more people then.
---
same.  kinda aggravating considering i thought i was done!
---
Well I was queued up with my friends since I didn‚Äôt want blueberries to suffer because of me so we did in fact win, but I was at the bottom with 5 kills so not very epic.
---
Time to leave the game bro. You won.
---
I guess that‚Äôs why we got finishers.
---
On the nessus map to the right of the Leviathan there should be a thing for the menagerie and a thing for the tribute hall. Have you done the invitation quest and unlocked the chalice yet?
---
Some gentle giants that people hate for some reason.
---
Vivimos en una sociedad
---
Probably the most prominent crit spot out of all the enemy types, yet for some reason, I can't ever hit it as accurately...
---
What is this "purple ball trick"? I too would like to be introduced to the ways of the guardians before me.
---
Empyrean Cartographer ornament on regular old crucible gauntlets.
---
To piggyback off this thread, if I was to dismantle my breakneck then reacquire it through collections, would it still be masterworked or would I have to do that myself?
---
It‚Äôs also the combination of things. 
---
The most powerful exotic is on the class with the most powerful super, which now has the most powerful melee thanks to Thundercoil. 
---
I genuinely cannot even begin to comprehend what the thought process was with the people behind these things. 
---
Edit: it‚Äôs not that the community managed to find something broken when a bunch of elements were combined - it‚Äôs that they‚Äôre all broken in their own right and they‚Äôre all able to be run simultaneously.
---
There‚Äôs a bunch around the dreaming city too
---
This is why I gave up teaching raids
---
I have not done the invitation quest, does that involve beating the raid at all? I cant do raids.
---
Yes
---
I support this message
---
That would actually be a cool skin for the recluse since their both void, and the anti-barrier rounds adds a Better detail.
---
Also somewhat incorrect. Sprint buffs add up over two sources, and no more.
---
You don't need to do the raid. Try going to Benedict in the annax of the tower. See if he has a quest for you.
---
Everytime Bungie disables a weapon or a map because of exploits, people think it's the same thing. Well it isn't. Disabling a weapon isn't the same as investigating a bug.
---
I‚Äôm also looking for people to do it with. Add me, ElementalMatrix. 930 Titan
---
Blows my mind too, and I only play Titan. I usually play Missile boi or top tree Hammerbro for PvP though, and it's not because of some sort of moral high ground, it's a personal preference.
---
Synthocepts w/Missile boi is &lt;3
---
This is it. Give a class the most broken super in the game, the most broken exotic in the history of the franchise and leave it for a year. Resentment is gonna build when 99% of titans are either using bottom tree striker or OEM in every crucible match you play for over a year.
---
What shotties do you suggest ?
---
The only PvP exotics I have, is the huckleberry :((
---
Ok. Thank you for your help! Ive gotten bored of grinding for random exotics so now im doing quests like mida multi tool.
---
[Titans are the embodiment of freedom my man do you question freedom? ](https://youtu.be/5uPoDNEn3I0)
---
What‚Äôs the best stuff to do to gear up before I buy the expansion? Also I love playing crucible but where can I find the bounties?
---
I played a lot of D1 and remember leveling up with factions to unlock awesome gear and items. Is there a similar feature here and how do I go about making progress towards that.
---
Beyblade 2.0
---
They nerfed all supers‚Äô resilience to where a sniper can one shot. GG can 1 shot a striker titan now
---
That looks great! And adorable
---
True but I wonder how these always end up getting into my team while every player who ls only close to beeing decent gets forced into the opposite team. It's supposed to be luck based but when I see someone with 2 Hand canons I can tell you that he'll be at my side way before the match starts
---
Nah. Just kidding. The other team though...
---
Also, i think these should be swapped
---
Go to Orbit, change characters, and change back.
---
Go to the tower then back to orbit
---
What did you use to carve away at the front? I have tried to do something similar and I had no idea what to use.
---
Does every character get the weekly quests that give powerful gear? My hunter isnt getting them, my titan is.
---
You've chosen wisely.
---
My name is Toaster Oven in game and yeah I‚Äôve had so many terrible losses cause I‚Äôm just using a tube. The matches I got the most progress on were super stompy matches since I could easily camp the heavy lol
---
Its also that i was so high up on nessus the textures looked different. I parkoured to the top of the map
---
well i mean i can‚Äôt really go on my computer rn bc i got a bunch of assignments and i was curious
---
Dlc specific. During the Red War you should have been given base game exotics while in COO you'll be given Aeon Soul (Which suck) and for Warmind you get either Wormhusk Crown, Wormgods curess, or wormgods brow.
---
Strikes and Pvp. Iron banner active for a few more days too. These two are the most active
---
I'm a new light myself. I have not brought Forsaken and Shadowkeep. 
---
You can do any Raid that you own. Sorry, I don't raid even in D1
---
This is from what I been reading/watching, gain of salt if you will.
---
Forsaken: Has a lot of story and lot of content and is overall liked. 
---
Shadowkeep: Everyone on this and while the story is short, they are adding more next season...I think. Scarlet Keep strike one of the best strikes in the game I believe.
---
As said, you can do any strike rng, through the playlist even if you don't own the expansion.
---
Wtf? Really? So whole year the is no incentive for playing other activities? XDDD
---
Alright thank you for the advice it‚Äôs been much appreciated but 1 last thing, why are we actually trying to grind to the light cap, what do we have in the endgame?
---
Yeah I can really only recommend it if your new to destiny as franchise or if your looking to boost your light level up as the stories recap the prior games events as well as introduce the player to the basic mechanics gameplay elements and lord behind destiny also it helps you gradually progress from 750 to whatever.
---
I‚Äôm not a big bow person but I could use it if need be for something. One of my clanmates, who is big on bows, absolutely loves it. 
---
I know what I‚Äôm about to say may sound confusing and I apologize:
---
Draw time is a bit slower than other bows but it seems to fire faster and hit it‚Äôs mark in less time. Not sure how to explain it. Just how it feels/looks to me based on my experience with other bows.
---
so just "an corsairs"
---
Yes you can jus download the destiny app on your phone or destiny item masher on your computer and you can transfer anything between characters whether it be armory weapons items so yes you can switch it to a different account
---
Yes the ghost one is awesome
---
Everyone thinks they're above average (me too!) and realistically most people are in fact average. Which is what average means. :)
---
Lore not lord fucking auto correct.
---
I was so dreading this step. In the end, I shot 1 Truth rocket and completed it ‚úåüèø
---
I plead the fifth
---
I just hate PvP in general. That's where all the toxicity is. For now I'm just going through the campaigns. I've picked up decent-ish gear along the way, too.
---
üò∫
---
I‚Äôd like to see Bungie give Guardians facial animations when they do emotes with a helmet off
---
Is it a one-time thing or will it reappear?
---
There is no light here
---
Lol I‚Äôve ran into someone like this, and they didn‚Äôt die for a while so they killed me like 3 times in that formation. It ended when he died tho
---
I have no mod drops. But I think I know why. I might have time before reset to play thru the campaign. Do that and then I will turn in another 100 or so tokens. Bugger
---
Gat them with TLW, shotgun apes are super manageable as long as you punish aggression properly.
---
Lmao my high-ass was looking at those for a while thinking ‚Äúnah, they‚Äôd at least change the icon‚Äù
---
What's even better is getting an engram and it gives you like bright dust.
---
The tower has issued a no singles policy
---
This is so true hahah
---
IT'S only a New skin of the skullfort, not more
---
If I‚Äôm honest destiny 2 currently with the way it is your basically playing the end game initially when the game first came out you were required to play the campaign ‚Äúred war‚Äù and go from level 0 to 30 in order to attain a light level which would open the end game pretty much we‚Äôre as now you have a predetermined gear score at all end game activities are open to you besides higher light level quests, strikes as activities.
---
If you want the recluse you gotta get glory so you gotta do survival or survival freelance
---
It ends up as an abandoned quest and have to retrieve from the respective npc
---
You are a genius and I will never be happy until we get this
---
You only get access to powerful gear after reaching 900 power level
---
Alright I‚Äôll keep playing and more than likely buy the dlc periodically
---
As a hammer main, I‚Äôm fine with all the news, but why remove one-two peregrine? It‚Äôs not hurting anyone except for bosses. If anything, they should just nerf one two punch rather than kill the only pve loadout I‚Äôve been using the past 2 weeks. Me titan me sad
---
But you‚Äôre the one posting the comments... but yeah I suppose
---
Lol
---
That‚Äôs pretty much it you grind your gear from 750 to like 965 I think I‚Äôm not sure whether that‚Äôs the max or not it may go up eventually it‚Äôs just to unlock more events that are higher levels pretty much.
---
How did you do this?
---
You can get about 20 power levels per week by doing the powerful objectives (and not getting many slot duplicates), just don't complete them all at once especially the tower ones, since you can have all of them done and talk to the dudes in one go. When you get a powerful for 1 slot, your average raises so normal drops will drop slightly higher than what you have in your other slots, so ideally by the time you complete another powerful objective, you should have gotten several normal drops to bump your other slots closer to the highest (or very ideally all of your other slots, until you can't seemingly progress more without another powerful drop).
---
Basically all you have to do is play the game and the powerful rewards just come, there is some management required to optimize it, but I was 945 by the end of week 2, did several powerful milestones at reset and was 950 by the end of Tuesday so at most micromanaging will save you a week. For reference, I don't raid, but went into competitive for 25 games to get that damn smg and see what the hype is all about, and apparently competitive gives powerful drops for each (?) rank up so that was a massive boost during week 2 for me. Overall leveling is just as easy as it always was.

Squinting?
---
*Loads Not Forgotten* Moons haunted. And so is this gun.
---
If you finish one of those enemies they don't explode. But if you finish a Fanatic and theres another fanatic beside it, that fanatic will blow up. But not the fanatic you're finishing.
---
is it even possible to get that armor anymore? I kinda want it tbh
---
Lmao that's strangely specific but it makes sense
---
Yeah, it's One Thousand Voices. You get it from the Last Wish raid
---
He couldn‚Äôt find a pocket big enough to hold his Walkman CD player so he hot glued it to his face.
---
Agree completely about the OEM nerf taking wayyyyyy too long, and I'm a Titan that never uses it.
---
Creepy. Looking good.
---
I'd assume IB.
---
I shared and tagged @bungiehelp on Twitter. I'm not sure if that will help
---
hey good on you for being a titan main who doesnt use OEM!!! we need more like you
---
Easier,Iron banner but it's quicker to play survival
---
Thanks I'm over halfway with the wins and got fabled but I felt like survival was taking way too long
---
I personally hate middle tree arcstrider as the melee has more steps to it than a shoulder charge for a titan and can‚Äôt 1shot like a titan. If you make a weird request to do something that is supposed to be strong then make it strong. 
---
I personally love to see a peregrine greaves titan cause I know it‚Äôll be a fun time. Hunters already felt a nerf to 1-2 punch and liars handshake(with now has a cool down) so seeing bungie give titans the same treatment seems like fair play but I‚Äôd rather see the nerf reverted and the titan greave interactions stay.
---
I‚Äôm 96 kills away and I just got a god roll black scorpion the grind just got a lot easier
---
I'm at 1000 and still manage to catch Nova bomb on a wall
---
Yeah I had this issue too. Go to the tower. Speak to that girl I forgot her name and then you can do the quests but you have to start over.
---
Honestly hunters need a buff. Why does titans get a no cooldown ohk melee yet a hunter can put three flaming knives into a head at point blank and not get a kill only to wait 3 minutes to use it again? D1 had this same issue and they didn't learn from that pvp shitshow either.
---
Ban hammer
---
A weapon full of darkness
---
The girl that sell you spaceship
---
I need a fire team i am on pc. But I don't have a mike i hope that's ok
---
i know is clash and is not iron banner, but maybe; only maybe; is a glitch of the map, not a glitch of the gun, maybe the bug is that the level advantages are enabled.
---
Hunters were so much better in D1
---
Did shaxx watch Jojo's?
---
When it gets fixed.
---
I think he‚Äôs a cyclops.
---
I think bungie screwed something up. In one instance you hit two bodies with a 124 crit. U less you have some mod for your armor or something that increases crit damage idk
---
Honestly, compared to Forsaken and Shadowkeep, the Red War just seems so bland, without consequence. My personal experience playing it just led to me wanting to play any other campaign instead.
---
Ok, I now understand more how the system work! Thank you!
---
xbox - p00pmanager
---
I miss the sticky tripmine. I still don't know why it changed.
---
This is good hypothesis.
---
With New Light's release everyone is at 750 unless they were already higher. Go to Amanda Halliday in the Tower's hangar and she'll have the story missions. Everything prior to Forsaken is there and it'll start with 'Legacy'.
---
By completing these bounties, u get planetary material (or it can be randomly found all over the planet as u roam around in patrol zones). By trading in 100 of such materials, u can get a specific weapon or armour from the vendor's corresponding set
---
You get more points per IB win, that's how I finished up the wins required once I got to Fable.
---
Which one?
---
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA &lt;3
---
Yup... I definitely wouldn't either lol
---
Yeah I think I have that one already so I guess I got the only one i need ;)
---
That netcode is just even more of a problem because of hitboxes. You can be shot around a corner *without* netcode issues. I know, I‚Äôve been the one shooting. Was using Inaugural Address in year 1, it has so much aim assist that the bullet bent around the corner. Combine that *and* the netcode? You get the classic ‚ÄúI was ten feet behind cover by the time I died‚Äù scenario.
---
RIP the one guy without OEM
---
Sadly I never really played D1 outside of about two/three weeks after release and I played a titan back then so I have no idea what blink would have been like. I know in D2 I found it extremely annoying and borderline useless but one day I decided to start practicing and I've rarely switched off since. I even use it in jumping puzzles outside of the whisper and outbreak quests because I don't think those are possible with blink lol.
---
isn't there a once every 90 day Limit? check the Bungie FAQ
---
Awesome! ...But why?
---
Grah_Games I'd be happy to help üòÅ
---
Git gud scrub
---
I'd be honored to die by another titans hands.
---
Yup you'll just be playing on Immortal level difficulty
---
Go to the bungie website, log in with your steam, psn or xbox account. Then go to 'community' &gt; 'find fireteam'
---
You can create a fireteam and look for players or join an existing one there.

---
Nope its Buggy for me.....on my First Char i started before shadowkeep i get a quest and i have Access for the forges and i See Them in edz....on my Second Char i started After shadowkeep i get No key from spider...No quest from ada....and i dont See any forges in the director edz....she had bounties ! But i cant grab Them because there is a Information on the bounties ‚Äûyou Need Access to a forge‚Äú ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Are you people paying attention to the "POWERFUL" frame requirement of the forging? It can't be any frame. Every machine gun frame will work.
---
Really not but ok
---
Thanks
---
Lol. Its bungie.
---
I also have god role does not compute
---
Fusion Rifles are OP you can get an Erentil from banshee 44 in the tower by giving him gunsmith tokens for packages, i would also suggest getting to atleast 850 before trying Iron Banner.
---
New Light player here,how do i activate heroic on a cryo-pod event?
---
It takes a while to get used to. Around two weeks ago I decided to learn it, went on Io and just experimented with it for around 20 minutes after which time I got a grasp on it and the only time when I put blink away is when I have to do difficult platforming. The most important thing is to remember that blink inherits Your momentum so it is important how fast you move before jumping to blink and in what direction you are moving at any given moment. 
---
Obviously it is great in PvP to confuse opponents but it is great in PvE to dodge certain attacks, quickly move between covers, or even to blink straight into combat, quickly ressurect a teammate and blink back away into safety, which would be difficult to do with any other movement skill. I recommend trying it out, it's way easier than it looks at first, and may end up being Your  favourite.

Dude is on my friends list xD

the charge trigger and only 2 bullets is killing me!
---
As far as I know the first seasonpass is free when you buy the expansion. The next one will be around 10,00 every 3 months I believe. I think there is no way to buy it separately right now
---
I tought i have to see something in the red circle.
---
I don't even use arc only on quests but that it
---
i'm 913... am i supposed to be like enhancing my gear as well or just keep using the highest number thing?  does erentil have more than 2 bullets and shoot like a proper gun?
---
does it shoot faster and hold more bullets?
---
its sad really.. Thers mobile games that has more deph than Destiny 2 now..
---
This might make me look stupid but I cant find story missions? I don't think I've finished the campaign, but I've hovered over the icons and none have the names of the campaign missions shown on google. I have absolutely no idea wtf is happening and it's making me rage
---
Not trying to defend bungie, seeing that we don't know how the matchmaking really works in this case, just chiming in as a developer; Matchmaking is a clusterfuck you **can't** really get right and it's even worse with the high difference in total matches, team composition, player ability to work in a team and such.
---
You can't really base it on something like KA/D or even K/D values, because those ignore entirely how much value you actually provided to secure a kill or how well the used method works against different setups. Someone reaching high efficiency in lower "elo" levels with something like a shouldercharge cheese build for example being matched with a higher elo friend who teamed up with a lower (new player, for example) could suddenly result in said "high efficiency" player simply feeding, because his tactics don't work as well anymore. The game also can't tell how well you are in FPS games in the first place, which results in one player being able to dominate the other one pretty often, even tho both never actually played this particular game in the first place - add power levels into the mix and the whole matchmaking is getting even more complex. Players could who mostly play with pre-made teams also often ignore the factor of communication and teamwork that is much less common when going solo, resulting in higher efficiency players getting killed by people below their efficiency, because of those missing factors when playing solo suddenly; blaming the matchmaking.
---
There simply isn't really a perfect way to balance it out, but it also isn't as bad as people make it sound. In **a lot** of cases people vastly overestimate their own efficiency and understanding of the game and it's mechanics also.
---
Shaxx should have separate voice lines for New Light players.
---
"Oh, it's one of *you*. Well, get in there and die so *someone* can feel good about themselves, at least."
---
*Warlock with Chaperone, hides around corner, Titan runs around the corner even though I know I'm marked for vengeance*
---
*one shot kill*
---
It's pretty funny tbh seeing Titans with OEM try to rush me though I've thought of tactics to counteract this easily it does have a high success rate but depends on my reflexes and my awareness of how close the Titan is, OEM really does make them cocky lol
---
Riskrunner is low-key one of the most fun weapons in D2.
---
I have the same CPU and GPU with an M.2 SSD and I don't have any issues. It might be your internet speed.
---
I have it but have no idea where I got it
---
Petra Venj gives you No Turning Back, a compound bow, early on in the forsaken questline.
---
Subtle Calamity and Arsenic-Bite 4B are both random world drops or have a chance to be dropped by banshee in the tower whenever you turn in gunsmith materials.
---
Tyranny of Heaven, a solar recurve bow, is acquired from the last wish raid and can drop from any of the encounters. However, the curated variation (which has dragonfly) only drops from the vault encounter.
---
Hush, a solar compound bow, is a reward from the drifter after completing the quest you can get from him. You'll be playing a lot of Gambit (not prime) for this weapon but it's pretty good if you can get a feel for it's unique perk, Archer's Gambit.
---
The Vow, a solar recurve bow, is a seasonal event reward from the crimson days event by purchasing it from Shaxx during the event.
---
Accrued Redemption, a kinetic compound bow, has a chance to drop from the first encounter of Garden of Salvation (GoS). It has random rolls.
---
Hope it helps!
---
u got almost 2 months left to do it chill xD
---
Annoying fuckers. Well done. Gonna animate it as well?
---
the bosses shouldn't be killable after the first step of the heroic trigger has been done, have them revert after 30s if the next one wasn't completed by then if you're worried about griefing.
---
Nope. In PvP Randy does 28 body shot and 47 headshot. With kill clip active active it deals  37 bodyshot and 63 headshot.
---
So it takes 4headshot and 1 body to kill in PvP. 
---
Now with kill clip active.it takes 2 headshot and 2 body to kill.
---
Which is a huge difference imo because if you even if you don't hit your headshots it can still kill reliably.
---
If you want more information, watch fallouts video:https://youtu.be/N8O2nHDQ3js

It's an absolute cakewalk with the changes.
---
Just recently went to nearly 4000 points helping friends to get recluse and every single one of them had it done in like less than 4 hours of playtime from below 1000, or even 0 points. It might take more time if you are horrible at PvP, but if you are anywhere close to decent, it's possible in one session easily. I was even able to carry a few rounds with a efficiency of &gt;7 and 3 knockouts.. and i don't even consider myself that good in PvP in the first place, playing pretty much 90% PvE only.
---
I don't really do pvp but how would I go about doing the bubble titam? What is it and how does it work? Is it viable in pve too?
---
I'll be shoere to do it
---
I feel bad using it! It‚Äôs so easy. I got the heavy as death iron burden emblem WITHOUT J√∂tunn and I cursed my husband for breezing through it with his J√∂tunn.
---
i just started playing destiny again after a year and i personally think it‚Äôs very fun. just tried prime out last night and that was a good experience as well. some invaders can be tough to deal with and annoying sometimes but other than that i don‚Äôt know why you think it‚Äôs shit
---
You get more % (iirc 5% vs 2-3%?) from IB, compared to competitive.
---

This, no the math at how perfect the RNG has to be to reach 160 this season. It‚Äôs impossible.

Talk to Amanda in the tower hangar for the campaigns
---
Happy cake dayüéâ
---
I think if you talk to Amanda Holliday in the hanger you can play the old story missions.
---
Bruh people were non-stop complaining about those as well. Titans have just had the most low-skill insta-kill/annoying abilities; OEM, shoulder-charge (on all 3 subclasses), bottom-tree striker, fist-of-panic, titan-skating + juggernaut in D1.
---
I don't main Titan but I played him more than my warlock in D1 and more than my hunter in D2. I've always had a hatred for them in the Crucible though because no matter what meta was in, they were doing something that was causing me to groan after each death. And those same things were being complained about on the destiny subs.
---
Saladin:
---
Hmph... could have gone better
---
Can't remember her name but the NPC that fives legacy story missions is located on the very right of the tower on the map. Travel there and use a map feature. She should be there.
---
Warmind Campaign for sure. 
---
&gt;‚ÄòWormhusk Crown is a Exotic Hunter helmet that is given to Hunters by Commander Zavala as a reward for completing the Warmind campaign.‚Äô
---
Ty
---
It‚Äôs a good thing they don‚Äôt shoot faster or hold more because it would be unbalanced if they did. They are very powerful and if you get good ones ( erentil, wizened rebuke, J√∂tunn) enemies become very angry and dead.
---
Oh ok thank you
---
In Destiny 1 we have had the light since the beginning of guardians so from then still the Red war when we lost it the light have all that time to improve on them skills.
---
But In Destiny 2 we lost the light and then got it back which meant we have to start from sketch with learning our subclasses 
---
So arc strider is a old ancient form of Blade dancer.
---
Ok so what you‚Äôre saying is I‚Äôm better than you for doing lunas now with the hand cannon nerf. üòÇ just because you did it sooner doesn‚Äôt mean shit, I kind of agree on the recluse side. Hate the gun, hit it by grinding lunas and haven‚Äôt equipped it out of principle. They new to just remove it from game it‚Äôs just boring to have a meta that everyone uses
---
Nah, I just think you're hilariously full of yourself.

A cat ghost shell you say? I have a new goal
---
No, you aren't wrong, I like flooring Spectrals and Strikers lol
---
I think its because you hunt your prey; or something along the lines as you are a "being" that hunts lower food chained animals.
---
This is exactly why I'll never be a PC player. Idgaf about frame rates.
---
hunter from the action of hunting not from the class
---
Drifter is giving you stink eye right now
---
Yep
---
It‚Äôs allowing people who casually play to get onto the competitive band wagon slowly. You have to think long term, why are they doing it? Maybe they‚Äôll be bringing an extra step back... maybe something like trails where the hardest of the hardcore sweats can preform

For my buddies and I the gameplay is pretty fun; I felt like having more fun than I was on [Battle.net](https://Battle.net); I wish I could help my buddy but he usually is always up to raid, do strikes, pvp and help people out; as long as they help in return.

Questions regarding completing quests again on your 2nd/3rd character
---
I made a hunter as my first character and completed all of the legendary quests on Mars and received the legendary scout rifle and the legendary fusion rifle. I also collected the caches to get the legendary sword.
---
I have now created a Warlock and on Mars I noticed my cache progress is maintained between the 2 characters and the chest where you pickup the legendary sword is not there. I assume you can only have one of a legendary weapon for your entire account and if you want to use it on another character you have to deposit it in the tower and then retrieve it on your other character.
---
If this is the case is there any point in me completing Nascent Dawn and the other quest for the legendary fusion rifle on my new Warlock if I already have the 2 legendary weapons in my vault?
---
As long as the invader hit you before you died it's irrelevant what killed you.
---
Ahh thank you. Thought valor was for iron banner so been doing those too. I'll try survival tonight
---
Blink is my favorite jump and least favorite at the same time
---
Drifter HATES the Iron Lords, he'd never agree to that...Unless...?
---
Chasm of Screams is the name of the special version of Savathun's Song. That's the one you have to do.
---
Pretty sure Bungie prefers balance. And so do new players and let me tell you; getting the recluse now as a new player is still a grind. It might not be a long grind, but I still broke my controller last week playing Survival, lol
---
I one said that to myself after losing 4 in a row and ended up going from 4600 to 5300
---
Well I call bs then. Lazy programming again. Typical of bungie.
---
Biggest tip I have is to stick with one of your teammates and team shot with them. Most of the quests don‚Äôt take that long. As an average pvp player I finished recluse and mountaintop in 7 days total this last week. And once those quests are done you don‚Äôt have to play pvp anymore. Also if you find yourself getting tilted just take a break. You play worse if you play angry. Good luck!
---
Oh ok Im bit stupid. Does it have matchmaking?
---
But do I need to use it or just have it equipped or does it even matter?
---
You don‚Äôt like much do you? üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
But then how would they sell you color swaps as ornaments for 10$?
---
The monitor doesn't exactly make an impact... With the way the engine works, screen tearing wouldn't effect the framerate interactions, so hz don't really matter. Also, I saw nearly every Titan I came across doing it in open world, PvP, and other random activities like strikes and Gambit
---
Nope.
---
I got recluse in a day too, mountaintop is a whole different animal.
---
Okay thank you
---
The guy above is correct, it's just modified savathun's song. If you read the description of the strike you can see that it's for thorn
---
On PlayStation you can‚Äôt share DLC to sub-accounts, maybe it‚Äôs the same on Xbox and you need to sign in with your profile?

We weren't a fan of crucible back when we did it. And it was our first exotic quest. Don't get me wrong. Me and my mate were grinding to get Ace cause we wanted it.
---
im not entirely sure, but i think the element on armor only determines the type of mods you can apply, so i don't think it matters to sub class. someone correct me if i'm wrong.
---
Makes no difference whatsoever, affinity just affects what mods can be put on so use it away.

Even a baby can get to Fabled now.  Get to it!

I saw some of this teleporting crap in Iron Banner last night. This is why I never take pvp for any game seriously and I wish they would stop making quests require steps in pvp. I wish Bungie would separate pvp and just make it a new game so pve and pvp are separate entities.

I really wish they‚Äôd put out an info graphic in-game to just avoid the confusion. I think it would just give ease of mind to everyone

---
I‚Äôm a Warlock, I know it doesn‚Äôt prock on super anymore but if you were a titan why wouldn‚Äôt you use OEM anyway?ü§î
---
Hunters will always find something. I think Bungie left OEM mask in because their is no reason to run crucible with a titan otherwise really. Well can‚Äôt wait to go back to hunters hiding everywhere after you shoot them once.

When everyone on the team is using only fusion rifles to get the stupid quest done.

What if you... SUPERCHARGE YOUR LIGHT in my well ;) Haha jk...

To defeat the Cabal, one must **become** the Cabal.

Progressing the weekly flashpoint and/or bounties is faster if the events you do are heroic. You get more progress.

I agree, I switched from Titan to Warlock in Shadowkeep, I was ready for change.
---
Hey peen head he's talking about thunder coil artifact mod + bottom tree striker melee once you get a kill with it it becomes a one shot off cool down melee untill the buff runs out it's broken as hell and needs to be nerfed asap and this is coming from a Titan main
---
This is just odd..we both own shadowkeep and even after a reset it's still the same.
---
Thank you for your help though, i just dont know what else to do
---
Ya comp is actually a joke now..

Bro why is this so good?

besides a handful of new lights not having too much of an idea about heroic events (which is fair, since the game doesn't explain it all that well), my favorite part about so many people playing destiny is that there is ALWAYS an Escalation Protocol going on so grinding for EP weapons and armor has been such a breeze and so much fun.
---
Can confirm it's a joke, finished up my unbroken in 5 hours ( 0 -5500 ), and got Not Forgotten on my Fiance's free account that I got Luna's on last season in 6 hours the next day.

Add me I‚Äôm willing to help with whatever, gamertag is T1MSM0TH

No judgment just trying to understand the thought process.

I don't know if the Optimacy Set is available in 2.0 but i think it was an Eververse Set? If that's the case it should be available as an Ornament on every legendary Armor piece. So you can have the look of Optimacy on every armor you have

It's been around for about 3 quarters of a year at this point, and no major changes have been made to it. It's starting to get to the point where the community is getting fed up with Bungie over their lack of action, so we may see something done eventually. For right now and the immediate future, it is absolutely worth grinding for. The quest is called "From the Mouths of Babes" and can be picked up from Shaxx. It involves reaching a certain rank in Competitive Crucible, but with enough time and effort it should be fairly doable.
---
If you're worried about the possibility of a nerf, keep an eye on the This Week at Bungie blog posts on Bungie.net. They mention the state of the game at the last week, current events, and any major plans coming up. That is usually where balance changes like nerfs or buffs are discussed first.

Why? his only use for us is protection. Part of my headcannon is staying powerful enough that he won't abandon me for a stronger guardian.

This is only semi-true, i cant tell you how infuriating it is to turn a corner and use the SC only to fly by my opponent and not have the melee connect. Or use it mid-air and again just fly by. There are some odd jump patterns you can use as hunter for sure(dont know about warlock) to avoid a SC. Also fusion rifles and shotguns have been pretty effective. (Or in IB you can stack resilience, ive been killed trading melees cause SC didnt ohk). And SC has a CD.... Its honestly only good against unexperienced players or used situationally when you have a distraction (for instance flanking while the enemy is engaged in a firefight, but it has to be timed). Anyone who just runs directly at the enemy will die 90% of the time, if they live its because the person they were charging missed a lot of shots.
---
They‚Äôre extremely rare. I‚Äôm up to power level 930 and have only gotten 2 to drop. They can only be legendary (purple) rarity. I mean there are exotics but I‚Äôm pretty sure those are all from exotic quests
---
Tbh, I don't know what that is
---
That has changed since Shadowkeep came out. But thanks for your input. It helps a lot!
---
No, forget the overshield. It shouldnt need an overshield if it has the damage to kill what it is being used on. Saying it could use an overshield removes part of the power budget that could go to damage
---
I was wondering if anyone else remembered that monster of a fusion. Released way to strong and almost every patch to nerf it or balance it either broke Pocket Infinity, or all other fusion rifles in the process lmao.
---
Fair point
---
I just want to know what it is about Telesto that just breaks everything...is there some intrinsic hidden perks that is impossible to code around? It's my favorite weapon because it damages stuff in the real world.
---
See the good players don't die while doing this. The even better people survive on console.
---
Well was never really a pvp super. Before the buff bubble had no purpose, so I‚Äôm happy with where it is now.
---
What about your heat sink? I had a problem with this for a while, I couldn't even overclock since it was being throttled due to heat. Got a nice heat sink and gaming power doubled.
---
Problem was, I was still using the stock sink that came with the cpu.
---
I‚Äôm sorry. But by quiver hunter do you just mean someone using a bow in pvp? I‚Äôve just never heard the term quiver hunter...
---
You do what it says after Source:
---
When people talk about rolls they mean the perks correct? Do weapons all have static stats though? Like for example will 2 misfits with the exact same perks have different handling? Or will those always be the same. Same goes for armor and exotics. Should I keep reclaiming exotics for better rolls on mobility, recovery, etc?
---
They arent going to nerf that, if anything it will just not show up on the next artifact. Not that i dont agree about it being on the OP side but the whole point of artifacts is to experiment with mods and class build theorycrafting. It will go away when the artifacts change. They explained that in an article, link below.

‚ÄúWe want every exotic to break a core rule of the game. That‚Äôs what makes them exotic‚Äù- bungie developer

‚ÄúI did my job so well, I‚Äôve been banned from the game‚Äù- telesto
---
Ikr i thought i had an exotic already equipped as a weapon but noüòÇüíÄ
---
that would actually be pretty dope.
---
Is one eyed mask a new exotic?
---
I have headseeker and full auto. It‚Äôs fucking amazing.
---
Me in crucible üòÅüëç
---
Exactly. I‚Äôll warn you, it‚Äôs a cool gun and fun to use. It it‚Äôs not very powerful.
---
You do realize that you can also do this with a hunter, right?
---
Yeah the last one is a pain the arse to complete with the class abilities
---
Im part of a ps4 clan... about 40 players, we raid pretty often and we made a reddit post for recruiting about a week ago
---
Does it return ammo when you hit the shields at the boss?
---
In pvp you could use the time delay projectiles to max super energy with a weird glitch. So it‚Äôs temporarily disabled so that pvp is fair and they can fix the bug
---
I remember Destiny 1 on Xbox 360. Let me tell you, the inventory would take up to 30 seconds sometimes.
---
New objective: Tea time
---
ah yes its a good thing that the wing contender gear still drops
---
The sets literally don't drop anymore
---
Yep! I was thinking why wouldn‚Äôt the darkness want to use guilt against us and have us fight someone like Cayde who we could‚Äôve saved if we got to him in time. We could even fight a nightmare of Taiko 3 from the savthun‚Äôs song strike (forgot the name).
---
This is me getting the lunar fashion triumph. Bubble, barricade, Izanagi, and the boss is gone before anything can be done.
---
Snipers and fusions are also a thing
---
New Light and already complaining that Bungie is "making" you play crucible.
---
You're assimilating nicely.
---
Yes plz.
---
&gt; If you‚Äôre even decent at PvP then it‚Äôs worth it.
---
And... what if... I'm not at all decent at PvP? How ignorable is it?
---
Literally everybody except bottom-tree OEM mains: "It's broken"
---
Who's left?: "No It'S FiNe"
---
This the just the story of every FOTM build in every competitive game ever. Bungie is just slower than most at balancing. Enjoy your meta-complaining; it looks like the devs have finally gotten around to you
---
They probably fixed it on the perk side and not the projectile side. Or in other words, that fixed the issue for blinding well and didn‚Äôt consider any other perks at the time, so now they have the same issue again.
---
Me swapping guns in IB for that next quest step
---
They probably also have armor and weapons in the 930-940 range too.
---
What platform?
---
This is totally me!
---
I actually ended up doing just that.  Wizened Rebuke just stopped counting for me (I was getting the kills, seeing them in the feed, nada).  So I switched to another one I had in my vault and suddenly kills counted again.
---
I've been thinking a close-range Chaos Reach to the face. Like just one-handed laser to the dome.
---
man, eff fusion rifles.
---
For some reason, season rank doesn't display. My friend is season rank 40, but when I inspected him, it says 0 at the top
---
Bungie, please nerf the Architects!!!
---
There is a difference recluse is good in pve and pvp. FB is only good in pve.
---
Once again, I‚Äôm going to cry about how knife crits aren‚Äôt one-hit kills.
---
*sad hunter noises*
---
You must be on a void subclass.
---
Is there any great weapon for pve that doesn't required heavy PVP grinding like mountain top or involved raid  ? I just got a recluse and don't know which weapon should I equipped for kinetic and heavy slot . 
---
Ps: I have all dlc .
---
I wish I had a job so I could give you Platinum
---
Fuckin preach! I've literally never played a game so "fuck you, figure it out" since dark souls series. But this game has a wayy more information so... double fuck you? I used to groan at having to sit through YouTube videos that were 10 times longer than they needed to be but still somehow not that helpful just to progress in the game. And now I really, really fucking hate it. Still can't stop playing though so fuck me
---
It was a glitch on my end i am sorry about the spam
---
I pretty much keep recluse in my energy slot, i just hate the ‚Äòaim kinda in their general direction and get a kill‚Äô dynamic üòÇ
---
It's thought that counts and I appreciate it lol
---
I‚Äôve done this with SoP, last encounter.  Ok got my celestial equipped all set.  Damage phase: sweet mother of god there goes blade barrage.....
---
I'm 958, so someone wanna tell me why my super won't 1 shot a 961? And why I'm getting melted by a recluse that's 2 light lvls higher than mine?
---
-Thanks
---
Pretty decent! Try it out and see how you like it. Also see r/sharditkeepit to get other people‚Äôs opinion
---
I am returning after a hiatus from that time I sold my PlayStation, this time on computer. Having a blast with the new updates, and am unsure of whether or not I should invest in this fusion rifle. I mostly plan on playing Survival, since several quests seem to want me to gain Glory, so that is likely where it will see the most play. Thanks in advance for the advice!
---
I noticed this same bug over the weekend with the skiff coming from below deck under the Cabal carrier. Does this always happen?
---
I wish I could smack or kick mine he barely can pick a lock without tripping the alarm
---
Wtf is the Siva gun in d2?!
---
I like the both of you
---
If you capture it before you die it's one point. It's easy to argue without being in the match.
---
Fairly certain that was me this weekend when I decided to try out the Astrocyte helm. It seemed like a good idea at the time!
---
i'm a computer guy, but i still have my xbox set up to play rdr2 and halo, so i guess i have the best of both sides
---
you don't have to equip your highest level item , just keep them in your inventory , game will detect your highest average level and reward you accordingly .
---
Cute fireteam op
---
He's supposed to spawn on the second floor of the elevator ride. I killed him twice and don't remember doing anything special to spawn him.
---
On the plus side: I play Destiny on both PC and my PS4, (mostly PS4 because that‚Äôs where all my friends are), I played some rumble on PC. Three matches in and I ran into a hacker who was teleporting to each player and killing them in like 3 shots with an auto rifle. No one else got a kill.
---
Ok thank you
---
Do this all the time, now that bounties provide a significant progress to the season, I‚Äôll grab a bunch figure out what I need for the first few then middle of a match or say vex offensive... ok need to switch out to SMG sword and void abilities..... dammit console load already.....
---
Weekly Vanguard strikes, weekly Nightfall strikes, Nightfall high score, Vex Offensive, weekly vendor bounties (Tower vendors/Eris), weekly Crucible and Gambit matches, weekly Nightmare Hunts, Black Garden raid, clan contribution, prime engrams, world or quest exotic drops, Iron Banner bounties, Flashpoint.
---
I think that's it.
---
Complete the invitation questline
---
Iron banner should be the most popular right now , which is 6v6 control
---
Worst pulse rifle ever.
---
That actually sounds like a cool idea: Unique finishers for each super/subclass.
---
Then the one Hunter just comes up and takes it, that's great!
---
Have you done the introductory quest "the invitation" from Benedict? Have you unlocked the chalice yet?
---
Oh dang nvm
---
Play the objective, I'm offensive, I go after the next objective or defend one then move around camping doesn't do much and gets boring plus that's playing safe if i wanted to camp I'd play that cancer of a game CoD
---
I went in at 910 without much issue. Either I'm better than I think or everyone's much worse than they think.
---
If ghost emotes were priced around $5, I'd almost certainly buy 10 of them on the first day.
---
If we‚Äôre talking GoS, on console that final encounter is a mess in terms of frame rates. It‚Äôs a fun fight but lord I was chugging it out in that silky smooth 15 FPS at some points
---
Yeah sorry forgot to clarify that I have played it before.
---
It's a really crap one. It doesn't one-shot other players.
---
üòÆ üòÑ
---
Wait so was this Prime or regular Gambit?
---
Your team deposited 234 motes by that count.  Enough to fill the vault 2x over.
---
I wish you would've saved the gameplay of this match.
---
How do I unlock Black Armory content? I don't see any quests available from Spider or Ada-1, and I don't believe I have that quest in my quest log. Is there any pre-req I could be missing? Do I need any of the DLCs?
---
That would be a bit much
---
Could be worse... Could‚Äôve been that in a game of comp Control (Y2, not current crucible)
---
Fallen commander: ‚ÄúMAGIC!‚Äù
---
Light lvls are disabled in crucible. Don‚Äôt matter. Check your resilience. Some supers better than others. And the recluse is op.
---
YOUR BREATHTAKING!!!
---
Oof, yeah the majority of players in Iron Bamner have hit 950. I was pulling my hair out from only being 930ish, and btw after 900 only "powerful gear" will drop higher than your average light level. You get that from the weekly challenges and ranking up in crucible/gambit.
---
Ah the restriction is unfortunate but I guess it's to be expected. I think you should still have access to Xur though so you can get at least those pieces each week. Exotics aren't total game changers but they can give a hefty advantage especially when combined with armor mods and certain builds.
---
He became relevant in years when he dropped the best line in Destiny
---
There is the quest Zero Hour for the Outbreak Perfected. It's also a secret quest in the same vein as Whisper
---
Manually forwarding the ports has fixed any connection issues, but yeah the problem is that this only works if you're the only one on your network playing destiny 2. You'd need upnp to auto-negotiate multiple devices. 
---
Hopefully they'll get on this soon, requiring manual port forwarding for a AAA game in 2019 is pretty ludicrous.
---
I didn‚Äôt start my Titan till just before shadow keep and pulled the wish ended out of my collection, I‚Äôve no idea why it didn‚Äôt boost to 75 I also have j√∂tunn at 525
---
You have to be in a nightmare hunt unless it specifies a different scenario
---
the projectiles count as kills when destroyed with a grenade. so with the right set up you can unload a clip into the ground, grenade, and have super up 5 seconds into a match.
---
...but fools rarely differ
---
Just leviathan raid lairs
---
Basically higher is better as you can equip more mods. The element shows what kind of mods you can use. You can increase the number next to the element by spending glimmer, shards, and enhancement cores.
---
Lets roll back the clock to Wormhusk or Gwisin Vest I suppose and suddenly you'll see that everyone complains about something sometimes.
---
A lot of content in Destiny is obnoxious. For example: Why are Vex Mind Components a reward in the season pass when you literally don't use them at all?
---
I CANT BELIEVE THAT! I don‚Äôt have a medal for this! Hang on! I‚Äôm so proud of you guardian, and I want... you to have this!
---
They still rotate
---
Bleh.
---
Okay thanks bud
---
All of the season rank stuff will be unavailable next season and replaced with new rewards. Vex offensive is only going to be during this season, so get any of that gear if you want it. Eververse stuff will also most likely change next season.
---
Leave him alone he‚Äôs doing his best
---
I mean, until thunder coil doesn't proc on knockout. It's still a busted subclass. The super is just better balanced
---
I just like that I did it with a rando. Don‚Äôt be so negative man. If you don‚Äôt like it then just continue scrolling. No need to bring people down, you know?
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure vex offensive ends when the season does so anything relating to that would be something you want to work for
---
I actually like the fact that it looks like I'm wearing a jar on my head.
---
It‚Äôs the amount of energy available for slotting mods. It‚Äôs probably the variable least important in deciding which armor to keep as it is fairly cheap to upgrade. Much more important is the total points in the stats, located at the bottom of the stats column. I‚Äôm not sure why the blue armor always has 5, maybe to experiment with mods at low power levels?
---
I mean trying to do oryx 16 orb strat with normies was cancer
---
so if i normally play as striker (which i do) should i equip armor with the striker element?
---
Thank you. So xur is offering bounties now, huh? That's cool. So all the content from both of those are still available?
---
Definitely run IB as much as possible.  This is the only one where you will see such light level differences (first of every season).  IB armor seems to have higher base stats than any other armor I have come across thus far.  Other than that, just have fun, explore, and engage in everything you can.  Don't be discouraged if something feels too difficult at first, it will get easier.  Oh, and don't overlook the forge and the Jotuun quest.
---
Hm, yea it could've been about that quest, though I'm not sure.
---
Is it normal to repeatedly hit the glimmer cap ~~post New Light~~?  
---
  
---
Yes.
---
Okay, sweet, I didnt know that about the Vex Offensive... are there any triumphs, or a list of triumphs/challenges/quests I can find that are going to be exclusive that I should be worrying about over anything else? (Thank you for responding!)
---
Wow
---
Edit: r/madlads
---
Read the quest carefully.  Some do not progress on the moon.  Some only progress in nightmare hunts.  Others only progress in lost sectors.
---
There really isn't that much in the game that is still a secret so sooner or later you'll probably get whatever it might be.
---
That‚Äôs the energy level of your armor, and it basically dictates what kind of and how many mods you can equip on that piece of armor. You can upgrade the level so you can equip mods that require more energy
---
I'm not saying "get rid of the 20 different sets of mini fridges we have" I am simply suggesting that maybe stop making big bulky shoulder pads because there are to many.
---
They hate it when they fight us. They love it when we are on their side.
---
Was going to say the same. Always someone forgetting to detonate or not stacking.
---
What are they gonna do? Kill him?
---
Don't worry about the energy level, the thing to watch for is base perk level.  If you find something over 55, that's a keeper.  You can increase your energy, you can't increase base stat level.
---
I dont even know what the heck the forge and Jotuun quests are LOL... if anybody has Ps4 and is willing to explain some of this stuff over a party chat sometime this week; add me: DFCW_HEMIKID1_
---
This guys life consist of destiny 24/7 and collecting the unemployment check each week
---
If you get mad at this, you take the game too seriously
---
Ms. 5000 Watts has a really good build for Pathfinder using khepris sting and it's tons of fun once you get used to the flow!
---
Edit: things that affect invis duration only work for the person who proced the invis. I believe there is a glitch right now that lets you benefit from another hunters smoke when it's only supose to be yours. (If wearing the appropriate exotic)
---
Striker Titan OP plz nurf
---
Sweet, thank you!
---
triumphs are basically achievements when you clear a certain goal, there's a triumphs setting at the top bar when you go into your inventory
---
I actually did a ten minute presentation my sophomore year in college about how to do the Last Wish raid. I think the most questions I had were on the Vault mechanics and also questions as to why people never did the Riven encounter legit. I was honestly surprised at how much people were legitimately interested in it.
---
And just click on them to redeem them? Or is redeeming not really a thing...
---
*Just finished Gunsmith bounties*
---
*Goes into menu to track Vanguard bounties next*
---
believe it or not I had a better time in Fusion kills than Pulse kills.  you one tap anyone with Fusion, but Pulse rifle is downright useless in close range
---
Once you progress through the story far enough you will unlock the black armory forge.  Once it is unlocked, go to Ada-1 and pick up the exotic quest (something about giants).  This will allow you to start working toward the Jotuun fusion rifle, which is one of the better pvp weapons in the game.
---
Found.... or did you write it? ;)
---
The story for forsaken is pretty good but the exotics and last years season pass content is what you really want it for
---
*Chuckles*
---
I‚Äôm in danger
---
I‚Äôll drink to that!
---
Yeah, I didn‚Äôt know this was about bottom tree,  I don‚Äôt use bottom tree. I have far more fun with skullfort top tree. Bottom tree seems ok, melee doesn‚Äôt even one shot without a prior kill and the seasonal perk.
---
Telesto the besto
---
yeah its possible to do the pattern solo v its just easier with friends.
---
It was hard because no matter what it requires 4 phases and nobody can die at all
---
I fucking hated this is so much.
---
Hmm yeah the medals should be counting.. I don't know
---
I could only finish it from the new strike on the moon. That was the only one that registered.
---
Buy bounties constantly to build it up
---
Metal...................................................................................gear?
---
Probably
---
1, 5, 3, 2, 4, 6.
---
Yup just Google and you'll see countless guides
---
Calus Mini Tool is an underrated gun too, imo. I have one specced for stability (ricochet, dynamic sway, tap the trigger, stab master, and counterbalance) and it absolutely shreds. Made the smg portion of the iron banner quest super fun, just rushing up into people's faces and spraying them down lol. Probably not viable in high level comp, but definitely fun to use for a variety of activities.
---
How about a nice hot cup of tea?
---
2 tokens and a blue.
---
-Joins 920 strike for fun
---
-constant last guardian standing
---
-visible disappointment
---
Next iron banner armor
---
Wear traction if u got it. If ur on console switch to a high sense maybe. The pattern is in another comment. Read left to right from entrance
---
Bruh!!!! It surely did. Vanilla D-1 it one hit precision hit killed. Mr fruit even made a FULL montage of 1 hit kill throwing knife!!!!! I was a GG D1 main until they made nightstalker a thing.
---
I can't tell if that pun is intentional or not.
---
Iron banner... Iron gauntlet, Bruce Banner...
---
You know when you plug an audio cable into a speaker with the speaker turned on and it makes that horrible ZZEERRGEEEAAAHEEZZZZZER noise? It's that noise + glass smashing
---
I identify with this so so much! So many people have no idea the point is to control AND defend lol
---
This is why I'm happy it's getting nerfed
---
There are a handful around. Chill dudes
---
Damn this made me sad
---
I love you :)
---
Bungie said the cost to make it outweighed the amount of people who actually played it.
---
*shrugs*
---
You're right it helped alot thanks!
---
Forgive me but what is the bug?
---
I know the code, but it resets right when i reach 6.
---
She doesn't offer the key mold right now for some reason
---
Use two scout rifles. I used mida as my kinetic and a blue one that was a vesist scout. Think its called the black scorpion sr2. The legendary version is the sr4 I believe. Made the scout rifle kills go much faster.
---
For a second there I thought you had missed the guy who was afk and I loled
---
Sure it isn't in the greatest place pvp wise, but worst balanced in history? Nah
---
Done it a few times. Takes a bit of luck, but possible.
---
Yes, I‚Äôm well aware of devour.
---
Please read the rules before posting.
---
No LFG posts and no clan recruitments.
---
Probably pop tarts

Spoken like someone who doesn‚Äôt have recluse

I never got to capture B for my team, I was busy capturing A/C and trying to hold them, then getting killed respawning on the opposite one and capturing that while they wait for my void aoe grenade to wear off.
---
I was running down those same stairs to get to the Annex for Ada-1...
---
Soon as I rounded the corner at the landing, I ran out into a blank white space and fell to my death...
---
Nowadays, I walk a little slower and watch where I‚Äôm going.

It's a good ghost, I'm swimming in glimmer!

Sorry what's that

I don't enjoy it in IB simply because I'll get it 10 times in a row.

Rotation seems to be better in QP.

\*laughs in Dunemarchers\*
---
Dang. Wish those dropped more often.
---
I know the destiny YouTuber cheese forever has a bunch of them
---
He pulled a Danny Phantom on us

bottom tree has the skill where their FoH lasts longer with more kills so jm pretty sure just that
---
69 isn't all it's cracked up to be. Sometimes they don't shower beforehand and you're stuck there.
---
‚ÄúIf things don‚Äôt go your way just punch, punch again.‚Äù I think that‚Äôs how that saying goes.
---
Get a fixed odds from menagerie and when you get a strike that spawns you in a Patrol Zone (Strange Terrain for example) just keep running a lost sector.  
---
This works better with a full squad so that no one progresses the strike.  
---
Oh almost forgot you can use the artifact mod that gives you heavy ammo on finisher final blows and pair it with any helmet with heavy lifting/enhanced heavy lifting.
---
Isn't that why variks had robot arms because his original ones were ripped off
---
As a fellow hunter main, this is not the attitude to have about these nerfs. You can sit still in silence, praying your thanks to Bungie as I am, but bragging about it is not the way.
---
Plus, I don‚Äôt really know what people mean by [insert class] master race. Is that supposed to mean they are statistically the best class based on their skillset? Because by saying that Hunters are just better at the game is basically dissing your own class. That‚Äôs basically asking for a nerf to your own class and calling it ‚Äúeasy mode‚Äù.

Hunters are not by far the best class yet because Warlocks are dominant in PvE, Titans (still) in PvP. I‚Äôd say the classes are balanced, reasonable, and very similar in value, but Hunters are just barely in this ugly middle ground. *That‚Äôs* what makes Hunters true Hunters - a lone wolf that takes skill by using the best that they have and being resourceful, even if it‚Äôs not enough. *Not* by bragging about the misfortunes of over classes.

I have one to
---
Thought you said cookies xD
---
Im pretty sure Shaxx would say, get in, if you lose, stay or go. At least you tried
---
What is it
---
The good thing is I can still laugh about it when it‚Äôs happening to someone else
---
The prometheus lens when it first came out doe...
---
People used to draw dicks...
---
...dicks were funnier.
---
Jump in strange terrain nightfall heavy finisher mod use a fixed odds machine guns and just slay a lost sector on mars for a while
---
The game doesn't delete your medallions.  They probably have some left over from last year.
---
Not to mention shield bash which is meant to suppress gets real finkey when you try and use it on someone in a super, can use it and have your ability charge consumed but doesn‚Äôt actually connect or suppress.
---
Nah man, since Shadowkeep Scouts are viable again in Crucible which means no more staying in range of one hit kill melees most of the time.
---
Meanwhile I charge melee into the nodes. Some reason randoms assume I'll keep my distance.
---
I'm a Titan!
---
Choo choo!
---
I keep hearing the lore of destiny 2 is really good, any place to start for a newcomer?
---
It did lose alot of value as all of year one is free to play now.
---
I have some but its no use and can only be dismantled for bright
---
For leveling up in power it‚Äôs best to just equip whatever you get that is higher power than what you have currently equipped. While doing this mess around with the weapons that drop for you and see which type you like using. Once you hit 900 you need to start doing activities that reward powerful rewards. Still continue equipping what is higher as you go and still mess around with what weapons that drop. Eventually you start getting close to 950 and you will only have legendary gear and weapons. Hopefully by then you will have a good idea as to what weapons you like. There are better weapons for pve than pvp and vice versa. It‚Äôs all about building a skill set that YOU enjoy, not what the ‚Äúmeta‚Äù says to use.
---
Also boosts regen of other abilities so throw pop barricade, jump and nade to suppress, charge in for the melee and then finish the stragglers off with some gunplay and you‚Äôve basically got your barrier &amp; nade back.
---
As an OEM Titan, I feed on your hate and  misery. (J/K, I‚Äôm not that good and get shut down all the time.)
---
I can also suggest you bank every 5 motes like a relay race and run with full cheese like jotun + militia‚Äôs, pop some big guys run back. You‚Äôll get 50 faster than you realize, less chance to drop motes. Play as sentry or collector.

And Thorn DOT.

The only thing I could find was that the image was the cover image for gamenformer on December 3rd 2013 but no details of the actual artist.

---
Edit it was the cover image for January 2014 announced on December 3rd 2013
---
I did Redrix or Bygones, one-two punch shotgun or Erentil and Truth or Wardiff.
---
I‚Äôve used them all, and judging by the entirety of the community, yeah, titan exotics suck, OEM is the only decent one
---
Besides no one has even made a logical argument against my points they just deflect and strawman
---
PVE players? Who?
---
It depends on the severity of the nerf in my opinion, they don‚Äôt have to kill them like Breakneck and Redrix
---
I think I get the game mode, but I don't get why you're capping B
---
Like isn't it basically just Control but a powerplay locks the zones for a while?
---
It‚Äôs a one-bang. Once you press it, it releases projectiles and is finished in less than 4 seconds.
---
I managed to get it within 2hrs or so, i thought it would be something i'd never achieve.
---
Oh fun thanks
---
Best way to learn is by doing.
---
That's not broken...that's how it's supposed to work. If the OEM titan got a buff because his teammate got a kill then itd be broken. Counting telesto rounds as kills is broken. Waiting for a buff to wear off when it's supposed too is the way it's supposed to work. Just because you dont like the timing or the buff doesnt make it broken. Broken is when something works in a way it's not meant to work. When they add anything op stop before saying its broke because its probably just strong not broke. If you jumped and got engrams for it that would be a broken mechanic lmfao get it yet?
---
I suck with recluse in crucible but like the IB SMG called hero's burden. Meta weapons have never worked for me in crucible
---
Yes. Solo into a NF, and either farm a room with a ton of enemies, or farm a good world location.
---
It's about 3 hours of non-stop grind...but the gun is worth it.
---
That's part of an adventure
---
This is exactly what I do sometimes, geez, I even just tab and see some quests that I forgot, and start picking the weapons I need. LMAO
---
Damn, flashbacks to listening about how to beat Oryx while jumping back and forth off those disappearing ships
---
Which ones
---
OEM is good in comparison, but I guess we both forgot about Antaeus wards and peregrine?
---
Think it took me about 10 over 3 1/2 days. 0-2100 went super quick. The wins portion took the longest solo queue; I put it off for a long time thinking It was just out of reach. Then when I went for it it was surprisingly easier than I imagined
---
New light
---
Don‚Äôt really play anymore. Is blade barrage still a thing either he arms or did they nerf the shit outta it?
---
I would say aim for 60+ of keeping the gear and 65+ for Masterworking it.
---
90% hunters I‚Äôve met were just crouching with shotguns around the corners. Majority play hunter only for its looks and have no clue how to utilize all hunter has to offer.
---
*cries in Riven*
---
Blade barrage is not a bad super there are just better options for dps. Its still great in pvp (blade barrage).
---
They have the normal version which is 34 o believe.
---
So fucking true!!
---
Which grenade are you running?
---
I'm this way too. It's all about risk assessment. I'd rather bank motes quicker than wait and try to send a blocker
---
I don't get it.  Are you saying the color changes aren't random like Heroic public events?
---
How do I get more power ammo? I can go through entire strikes without any appearing. Doing any quest involving them is a huge pain.
---
It's an extra super that comes with the forsaken expansion for hunters.
---
Did you win?
---
I see, that‚Äôs really great. Good job!
---
Peregrine is absolutely useless, unless you‚Äôre meming, in a shotgun meta and the fact you need your shoulder charge up, anteaus wards aren‚Äôt consistent and don‚Äôt allow you to fight while using them
---
If you‚Äôre trying to win you won‚Äôt use them
---
The reason OEM is good is because it‚Äôs consistently useful
---
That makes sense, thanks
---
Laughs in Ryan Haywood.
---
Every Waking Moment. Rolls: Hammer forged barrel, richochet rounds, hip fire grip, and demolitionist.
---
Anyhow it should not match you into the game if there is only 1 minute left no matter what. Same shit is happening constantly in gambit and gambit prime matches as well.
---
And this is why I appreciate this sub
---
99% of Everything is solo content. The raid is literally the only thing that's not.
---
But that's impossible!
---
way more invested in the lore / characters of destiny and i think the gunplay feels a bit better and overall more to do 
---
not bashing on borderlands though, love those games to death but i prefer destiny for a couple of reasons
---
It's the adventure called Invitation from the Emperor. It was the first hint we got about Calus and he was the leader of the Cabal. Cool little adventure lore wise.
---
What power level are you?
---
We've been downvoted lol
---
Fuckin¬¥ hate Titans
---
literally this is control any time you play it
---
You are making my point more clear, it‚Äôs end game gear, you should have a leveled character, you do bounties, bounties are pinnacle, pinnacle gear is powerful if you‚Äôre leveled. 
---
Under leveled people can stick to regular pvp until they‚Äôre leveled enough for iron banner.
---
To  be honest i only really use recluse for PvE it makes things so much easier, apparently the Subjunctive is pretty decent with the right rolls.
---
Yeah sorry to everyone I played with. I used you all so I can complete my pinnacles. I was never playing to win.
---
Thank you. I have about 1500 gunsmith parts so ill try Banshee then ill spam gambit.
---
It's as much Mythoclast as Deathbringer is GHorn.
---
(It's not...it's just pretty good)
---
I can‚Äôt look at this image the same way since I found out that watering is a sign of severe eye infection in the cat. Poor guy ‚òπÔ∏è
---
I had the same thing yesterday when drunk. Same spot and everything. 
---
Somehow my drunk self hit tab and summoned my vehicle..... landing like Top Gun ace.
---
I sat in disbelief.
---
You are my worst Enemy on Vostok, but my greatest Ally everywhere else.
---
Nah it's oke, doesn't explain it in game.
---
Yeah I met the blades tree hunter in gambit earlier whilst I was running round with my gg knife party set up ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇ

195/960

I tried to start a discussion thread about how we're finally getting an OEM and bottom tree striker nerf, and all I got was 5 downvotes.
