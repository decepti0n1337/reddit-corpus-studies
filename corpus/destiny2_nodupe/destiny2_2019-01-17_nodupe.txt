Pulse rifles and hand cannons are optimal. Scout rifles can be viable as well.

I’m missing the ghost, ship, and sparrow. Locking titles behind RNG is the biggest load of hogwash I’ve ever seen. I’ve been doing these on all characters every week, and I haven’t gotten anything yet. It’s infuriating that I’m locked out of Cursebreaker because my RNG sucks. 
---
Bygones
---
Seeing as it competes with machineguns, it really isnt all that. Oneshotting supers is nice though!
---
a shot in the dark would be because people can play as whoever they want for literally any reason they want lol
---
First time I was teabagged I thought dudes controller went hinky...had no clue WTF the guy was doing! 
---
I have this with the shit called "iron banner" you know, that bad decision which makes the strong even stronger and the weak glass windows

unless I missed something and breakneck reloads on kill...

big oooooof.

that's a yikes on my response dawg
---
I'd love to have a chance to get that. It's rrrreally nice.
---
u/cloakboi is absolutely correct - there is so much non-raid content to grind out each week that even smashing all your weekly stuff is a challenge if you aren't devoting a lot of time to it per week. 
---
Edit: the above applies if you aren't just trying to get it all done as fast as possible, and instead are trying to maximize your power gains each week. 
---
I'm not sure, probably someone else as you can have the same username. I was with Burntcrepe and JediTurtle. But maybe.
---
one thing I have to warn u. without catalyst, the charge up time is longer than the quest itself. don't bother to aim for the head because u can't even aim with this.
---
tldr: bring it to invade and train
---
For me, when I was in middle school (long time ago... lol) I wrote a series of stories while I had some free time and there were two female characters in those stories that have stuck with me all these years.  They end up in just about any video game I play as some form or other.  So naturally, one of them is my female Hunter and the other is a female Awoken.  One was a ranger with a bow, one was a magic user.  They fit in very well.  They been in everything from Ultima Online, to WWE games, to Destiny.  :)
---
let's make sure there is no toxicity in the comments i only want constructive criticism, thanks.

If you're on PC, would you mind if I joined for some raids sometime?

#COME ON AND SLAM, AND WELCOME TO THE JAM
---
Agree completely.
---
Same goes for individual triumphs. The Spider's weekly Wanted enemy bounties are this way. There's triumphs for every one, except that the pool is weighted. I have seen Silent Fang probably 6+ times, Arcadian Chord 7, and Gravetide Summoner maybe 8. Yet Blood Cleaver and Combustor Valus have only come up twice each since the release of Forsaken.

Also it wont matter if you start other characters you will be able to get the other 2 on them.

I hope jokers wild brings a western theme to it, I feel like it might.

don’t you know the crucible rules? If you don’t use the approved hand cannons, pulse rifles, and shotguns you are crutching 
---
I the annual pass, so yeah thats not an issue. But i still cant get through the wall 
---
Before this past weekend I'd never done Shattered Throne.  Always thought it was out of my league (despite having 3 650 characters).  I ran it once on my Hunter, one full run on my Warlock, and one run through the Ogre encounter for Wish Ender.  This morining I was dimantling legendary sparrows I'd got from Eververse of of engrams and right as one dismantled I noticed it was speed 160 like the Exotics, thought I saw the word 'silver' in the name so I check my collections and sure enough there it was.  Somewhere in the almost 3 runs I aquired the sparrow and didn't even notice.   
---
Power over Ethernet would benefit the tower greatly
---
What ah ya, frahm bawston?
---
Really it isn't an MMO, it has some MMO elements in it, but it is in the FPS genre. Just like it has a couple RPG elements in it, but is definitely not an RPG. 
---
Bungie considers it an FPS, and most media does as well.To me, one of the main differences is that it's not really massively-multi-player, as far as I've seen you only really get instances of up to 6 people in PVE. That's just one thing that sticks out to me, but f you search it, you'll see many articles that explain it better than I can.
---
I find it interesting that not many know destiny 2 has a built in tracker lol
---
Looks clean :)
---
Wtf i thought 2 ka/d was low
---
Yup, dropped it on my 4th powerful frame. Tried twice last week and twice this week.

You get the final key from a quest that Ada-1 gives you. 
---
Base game legendaries can drop from non-dlc lost sectors, public events and escalation protocol bosses.
---
Also you can buy some from the cryptarch
---
2 ka/d puts you in the top 1%
---
It is possible for world gear, but RNG is against you. Y1 Crucible and Strike gear are gone now and are unobtainable. But by getting lucky with loot chests or Faction Rewards and engrams from Rahool you can get some Y1 gear. Not sure of any other way
---
The level cap is at 50 but you don't need any dlc to get to 50 the light level is at 650 and like the level cap you also don't need any dlc to get there.
---
Makes sense I was hanging out with a friend and his brother saw it and was like yo everyone get in here look at this shit and he was in a public event
---
lol well personally for me I chose an exo because otherwise in my mind I'm basically a magical space zombie which is kinda creepy . and I get the point that hes curious about peoples choices I just feel like people shouldnt need reasons to not play the same gender as they are in real life. I know he didnt mean anything you just see a lot of people getting fucked with for their choice/reason for that choice. Personally I stick to male because not only am I a Male but I just like armor variations for male characters more in games, but I'm not gonna judge people for choosing not to
---
I thought the next part was a lot easier. 
---
At least you can be in control of wiping all 4 on the enemy team rather than relying on randoms to win 10 games. 
---
Just got one that lets you swap out Dragonfly and Rampage.  Thanks Ada

Oh shit, go to the spider and get them MATERIALS

Had to do the same...
---
Where did u get the rassmusen clan shader?
---
with activsion no long having the rights to the game, do we know what that is going to mean for pc? don't want to buy it and find out we are just getting cut off. thank for btw :)
---
it looks like the conspirator 
---
Ace of spades is a really good handcannon to grind for I just got it today and am never going to look for another one.

I’m just disappointed you don’t have Reddit in dark mode

Not part of the annual pass, the annual pass contains Black Armory, Jokers Wild, and Penumbra.

So far I haven't heard anything about bungie doing away with pc and since there is quite a few players on pc I don't see them doing away with it.

Watch out for sterile neutrinos!

Awesome play 🥳
---
the 625's better for both PVE and PVP
---
I dropped Le Monarque in Bergusia with a regular frame and not a powerful one. 
---
microsoft invites you to join their family
---
If it was a frame from a previous week the game bugs out and turns into a powerful frame hut then u screw yourself because that's the only powerful frame you'll be able to do on that character. I know because I've tested it
---
He can't do that! Shoot him or something
---
Sorry I didn't word it correctly. What were you doing when you got the ship/sparrow/ghost?
---
Oh yes of course master, no one can be good at the game except you! He must be using OP tactics! 
---
taken armaments basically give you infinite ammo if you can time those grenades, and a toe shot with queenbreaker is basically a headshot anyways
---
There are much better rolls for the scout. full auto and zen moment is underwhelming when you can get rolls like (rapid hit/ rampage), (triple tap/ box breathing) etc etc
---
Between the Jotun and the Blast Furnace, Bungie is definitely sending out a message that if you don't buy the season pass, you're probably not going to do so good in crucible.   My last two matches, that's literally all I got killed by (and supers of course).
---
*\*Looks slightly in his direction\**
---
**30 SECONDS MARKED**
---
Is Kill clip better then rampage? because you need the reload with Kill clip right?
---
It’s not a dumb question, the way the content is gated behind the expansions is really whack sometimes. 
---
Kill clip is better in PvP and has a decent stance in PvE. You get a kill, you can time your reload to be just perfect in both to have a damage boost when you turn a corner or something. Kill clip is just more... controllable yet situational? 
---
Omg, this is best thing.

I thought it was called "Destiny The Suggestion" with all of those posts

Dont know what tracking we're seeing but I was strafing in a 1v1 engagement and I saw a Jotunn shot fly right past me. Theres also some cases where I barely move and it still misses. Seems pretty inconsistent I guess.
---
As a pc player, the lack of camera movement for aiming there gives me anxiety.

Owk, Thanxs for the info :) gués ill go and beg the rng gods for it \^\^

Thatd be FANTATIC

don’t forget 1k voices and the ship

for the last 6 weeks I’ve ran 3 riven cp’s and not gotten it-I’ve opened at least 30 chests total.

my friend,,,, has four (4) clears and he’s got it twice
---
Download the destiny app and you can matchmake fireteams for the raids! I've done all of them countless times as a solo player, mostly great experiences. 
---
Oh my gosh I was so excited for Sleeper, I loved Linear Fusions at the time and had heard it was the best in the game. It took soooo long to get and it felt great to finally acquire it.
---
Imagine my disappointment when I realized it sucked :/
---
Two completely different ghosts mr. 2 million iq
---
is that outlaw on a shotgun? bungie...
---
the besto!
---
Really I think that Bygones is still better than blast furnace for most people, because for me at least hitting all 4 crits on both bursts is inconsistent at best. I can land all 3 with my Bygones almost every time and it only takes 6 crits 3 bodies to kill any guardian. 3 bursts every time and it's basically free headshots. Plus if you proc kill clip it's a 2 burst with 6 crits 
---
But, if you're a titan and a shotgun using douche-nerd, you deserve to be bagged for having no skill and having a false pretense of skill. 
---
That brought it to vr
---
A lot of destiny is grind heavy and offers a lot of content, which I don’t mind at all but as mainly a solo player myself I feel you on that. Playing with people makes it so much more enjoyable and easier. 
---
The only time when I need to play with people is when I want to raid. I always search off of LFG posts, and I’ve found really chill, friendly people from there so maybe give that a try? ^.^
---
They could use the Infinite Forest to simulate past raids like Crota and Vault of Glass, etc. 
---
41 damage per headshot, most guardians have 190-200 health. it takes atleast 5 with no damage buffs
---
I have a pretty large clan with great people but since I work and am commuting to college I don’t have much free time so when i do have time to game I want to talk to my good friends rather then raid with guys i don’t really know. Maybe in the future i’ll have more time 
---
Relog, yes RELOG, RELOG!, into your account through the battlenet account and it should fix this, if anyone isn't aware
---
That kinda applies to Ada more doesn't it.
---
time to go watch some red vs blue
---
That would require a Spy vs. Spy level of incompetence on the part of the saboteur
---
I only have one character and I'm pissed I didn't get it this week. 
---
Or just help people out... ya know, for the sake of being a good fellow guardian. 
---
Of course it was hunter saying that and a hunter responding 
---
Nice
---
alright MA'AM

[removed]

Read that in Shaxx voice
---
Looked cool lol.. i dont personally use swords much.. 
---
Theres 2 other circles around that area when you see “the enemy is moving against each other.” When 3 people step on those circles when it’s glowing, a secret boss comes out - and you get a little triumph for beating him 
---
Absolute god roll would have ricochet rounds and maybe arrowhead break for the barrel, but your roll is extremely good.
---
Watch out crossing the street!
---
The chest in the Ascendant only gives drops once per week per character. So you can have 3 shots. But you can run the challenge as many times as you want. 
---
&gt; People wonder why I use my “male voice” on the mic
---
They don't. No one cares what voice you use. 
---
I like it becouse well its made after red dead wich was my favourite pulse from d1
---
You need to do the quest line to unlock each forge.
---
Some weapons are tied to different forges unfortunately. Like Hammerhead needs a Volundr completion, the Pulse is Izanami, etc etc. 
---
You need to unlock Izunami forge for blast furnace, seems self explanatory
---
Yep, with Range MW its a lot nastier
---
Not everyone has to participate in your fantasy
---
Maybe it’s not a glitch but it’s actually lunch time. 
---
Don't sweat about the time it will take to unlock the new forges.  They really don't take that long.  Google it first and you'll find the quest steps and best places to nail them quickly. 
---
We need to be able to farm at the farm.
---
Sigh... RiP the good og Last Word
---
Since the buff, I have received less exotics than before. I would say maybe 2-3 exotics in total have dropped since that change. It's irritating. I also have a friend who only needs One Eyed Mask on his Titan. Has every other exotic and has continually received dupes for about a month now. 
---
I believe in you
---
The Gwisin Vest is my last exotic and has been for a while now.
---
Punk, i am the wall that the darkness breaks against

I initially read this as “when I was in the shower yesterday” and it became even funnier.

yeah, yeah... i know... he probably is the size of a Cabal.

Putting aside that I generally get less exotics since that change I can not claim that chances to get a duplicated have been any lower than before.

Raiding his panties!

Unlikely to have a sale just because they have a split. Even if they do, it won’t be the level of Black Friday sale.
---
Almost wipes the team. Gets tbagged. What a fuckwit
---
Ada-1. It's not even a competition.
---
If you're awoken.... is that insest? 
---
Telesto is a great fusion.
---
At the moment titans are the most OP class in pvp - ONE EYED MASK needs a damn nerf
---
I think it depends on your elo or raned game mode which class is more played.
---
competitiv = titans
---
quickmatch = hunters (most played class) 
---
my god the teams are awful 
---
As long as you don't get on your sparrow at least.
---
Dreaming city 550 with the raid. 
---
Sotp 650 
---
And yes 
---
You have to kill them with the actual burn on the fifth shot, not just the shot itself
---
If other expansion you're talking about is the annual pass no but if it's warmind or curse of osiris you need them to buy forsaken in the first place 
---
A shank. I sleep
---
An explosive shank. I sleep
---
An tracer shank. Real shit?!
---
I noticed that also it should be changed to the matching ammo type to avoid confusion. Primary, Special, Heavy.
---
Don't forget jotun and Luna and NF and lemon arque and two tailed fox etc 
---
How do you perform it?
---
The Erentil from collections is a nice roll for a Y1 weapon.
---
Also Jotuun from the Bergusia Forge seems to put Crucible from easy mode from what I’ve seen/read with the AOE and tracking (don’t have it yet myself).
---
I think expansion I and II is included in forsaken
---
Apparently making fun of a shithead is transphobic because she is trans and trans people are exempt from criticism over shit behavior because... reasons.

Ok, snowflake. Whatever you wanna tell yourself.

I've been using it with that ornament in PvP with the increase rate of fire and I drop people. Not sure how it fairs in pve, but PvP it gets the job done
---
Ok @ First tyvm.
---
Oh ok but i read the catalyst for fighting Drop just in raids to and i got him from a normal Strike .
---
If I ever get another rampage spec I will but I’ve only got one so far. And I’m on pc so the stability is already overkill 
---
If it’s not good enough to stand on its own, is it a good exotic?
---
It’s a mistake....please stop posting this. You’re the millionth person to point it out
---
How much was it? Are there multiple volumes? 
---
omg this is NOT a bug - just force them apart - drop a pulse (or other nade on them, pulse seem to work ok), use a super etc, i think if you push them it forces them apart also - it's not hard to figure out and it's not the 1st instance of servitors shielding each other in destiny
---
This is exactly why I run everywhere. Why make yourself into a larger target?
---
Laughs in Banner Shield.
---
I started with hunter and then swapped to warlock and titan as well. One of the things I couldn’t stand was losing my lift/glide if I tried to ready my bow and shoot from the air. At least with hunter I could jump again after and continue to go up. The other two just kind of sink. 
---
t-bagging is just a bit of fun - try to remember it's a game - nobody is bagging you IRL

Couldn't tell ya, lol.  That 100k NF was the last thing I did before I got off last night.  Haven't even shot the thing yet.

---
Gotcha thx!
---
Who cares?
---
NEEDLESS TO SAY
---
I had an awful day at Gambit yesterday, I was afraid this was gonna feature me! Me and my friend lost every match (we played 3), we didn't get the primeval first a single time. First match I lost 12 motes to one of those Minotaurs in those caves because apparently, all my teammates (including my friend) were somewhere else where no motes were to be found for some reason. The minotaur kept blinking away after I put 2 or 3 Thunderlord rounds into his shield, when he came into shotgun range I switched to my hand cannon like an idiot and got smacked like I deserved. But it would've really helped if others were shooting as well instead of doing I don't know what.
---
People seriously need to stop shotgunning my blockers... 
---
damn.
---
*wants
---
Not even close to the Harpys that have the Trace laser. Pinpoint shit
---
When I forge with a friend, we like to have one run around punching enemies to burn them while the other finishes them off. I usually do the hulk smashing as a Devourlock so I heal myself here and there with kills.
---
The shader comes on curated weapon drops from the Scourge of the Past raid
---
I would absolutely love it if they did something like this. Even just having more patrol zones and strikes would be great. I really wish everything could just be in one game, to be iterated on and expanded from there. If they had gone with this, I think Vanilla D2 would have been much better received as a giant expansion on top of 1.
---
XDDDD
---
You can do it whenever since you can always pull another from your collections that will be 20 LL below your current LL at a cost of: 
---
* 777 Glimmer
---
* 7 Legendary Shards
---
* 7 Gunsmith Materials
---
That should be sufficient for leveling, and then once you get a 650 kinetic weapon, you can infuse AoS with it to max Ace out.

This toxic belief that everything is everyone else’s fault is what got us here in the first place, you’re digging the hole deeper for the community.
---
Mid tree sunbreaker, each kill gives you bonus damage, stacks 3 times. Worm god caress, stacks 5 times. Each battery hit doubles damage to that enemy. You can 2 hit kill a colossus
---
Congrats man! 
---
You: bungie....why?
---
Bungie: u didn’t kill the servitor fast enough?
---
What do you usually run? I tend to run 5-6-3 or 6-5-3
---
The one from the Bergusia forge. It drops when you complete Bergusia-related quests.
---
I'd rather die to telesto. If you get hit by jotunn it's your fault, and you can just shoot the mines and they blow up
---
Sagira and failsafe are wifing material
---
Zavala. I really like his voice. 😏
---
Because it's irrelevant in this game type. Sometimes it's easier to just respawn. The territories are what get you the win, not kills. 
---
Said like a true scrub.
---
not being mean or anything but like you mean year and half of being inactive most of the time tho right? Cuz i got to 650 in like 1 month (not bragging im actually asking) 
---
Big OOF
---
644, or 554
---
If you judge an entire community by one person, you’re the problem. Not me.

Very cool

Tirading and falsely accusing people on Reddit isn't going to fix a thing about that
---
I’ve been trying to get a Subtle Calamity with a draw time MW since Forsaken was released. If I could get that with archers tempo &amp; either rampage or dragonfly, I’d be a very happy Guardian. 
---
That means RNGesus loves you, bud.
---
No. You heal on melee with my build. Healing+built up stacks of damage &gt; just bonus damage. 
---
That looks insane
---
Suggestion: fix this minor annoyance I had with the game because I want it that way! 
---
Es tut mir leid m8
---
No i was talking about DTG. This sub might have some shitty memes but I’ll take them over ‘Bungie Suggestion’ posts anytime. Shitposting is an integral part of a gaming community. 
---
Yeah that is part of the stop gap to make content stretch out.  So looking for ways to "cheat" the system is psuedo pointless, as there will not be much grindy content as it is now mostly time locks.  You can always hope for a glitch.
---
I think it has been increased since mid December. I have had absurd Rng for like a month.  Every Hunter Exotic and all RNG exotics to date have dropped at least once. 
---
I’m currently 649... the grind is real!

Mara Sov was born after the golden age. During the Golden age humanity sent people out into the void to be explorers where they met the darkness. They made a deal for their survival, turning them into the Awoken. Then after unknown decades of wandering Mara Sov seized control and led them back to Earth to find it under siege sometime before Twilight Gap. 
---
Mara is suggesting she should have killed the travellers when she got here. In her mind, Awoken tech and her alliance with the surviving Ahamkara was all that was needed to stop the darkness. 
---
Wow, i've never seen two perks in third column on PoS.
---
And yes, its pretty descent roll!
---
It does make sense, her "plan" wasn't formed until the Taken War. She had the power to destroy the Traveler long before that.
---
Oh dear :( I think my most ridiculous, and very brief, spinfoil was that wish 15 was somehow hidden in those little blinking lights. 
---
Thankfully it made so little sense that I kinda realised it was silly not long after I thought of it. 
---
Looks like a skull from MGSV
---
Ooo, I touched a nerve.  Need a safe space, sweetie?

It's a win-win either way
---
sniper shanks are the bane of my existence

You need Forsaken dlc.
---
Thanks Cpt. Obvious. 
---
I just mentioned that I found 2 Out if Maps in the game already. By now it’s 3 that I already found but yeah that’s all I tried to say. 
---
Ah, we’ve finally found out what the Drifter looked like before he was reborn
---
I'm not super up on the lore, but aren't the awoken specifically descendant from the first humans of the golden age who went out to the edges of the system? Then they turned into awoken during / after the collapse?
---
So it wouldn't be possible for an awoken queen to exist before the collapse.

Softcap is 600 now, they patched it so people could get to the forges quicker.  You bump up 10+ish LL each powerful drop you get until 600LL

*There is no light here...*
---
during the collapse, but they werent made from nothing they were converted from a colony ship being used to send people out of our galaxy in a desperate bid for survival they were turned into the awoken as punishment after Mara as the captain of the ship declared to the darkness that they were neutral in this conflict and that they were not of the light or the traveler, as such the entire ship was made into something different, not light or dark but a mix of both 
---
I’m crying. That’s spot on . 
---
*accepts your gracious gift and proceeds to chant a song in cayde's name, while marching out of the tower* 
---
Shield Bash going clean through people with no damage happens fucking CONSTANTLY. Feels like way more than either of hammer or shoulder. Also I think it misses consistently if it collides with someone else doing melee on you.. 
---
I heard it does, but that's about as far as my knowledge goes.
---
Arararagi-san
---
thats.... not correct, atleast not the begining, the awoken were converted during the collapse as a cruel joke from the darkness, but they were human before that, I told the whole story in another reply
---
It always seems to be the one exotic you reallyyyy want is the one your missing lol. 
---
isn't that the raid sniper? it's good
---
r/bigtiddygothgf
---
Is it good I’ve heard people talk about it but idk ( I’m on Xbox)
---
Leviathan raid shader, Calus's Selected
---
It's great, especially paired with the IB sniper too
---
Why did you decide to make this post about you? Why can't you accept that its being presented here as a meme for a hearty laugh? 
---
Oh God. This is sad. But don't give up mate. It's worth the wait. 
---
I haven't, I usually use Nezarec's Sin to get supers faster. I'll definitely give it a shot though now that you mention it! 
---
Nope, same stuff.
---
1 drop per encounter per char per week.
---
If you wanna go only for the exotic you can always use wall of wishes (wish 8 i believe) to go straight to riven... 
---
Wait did they already change?
---
Whats wall of wishes? I got googling to do but the exotic is top priority for sure. But the raid is pretty fun
---
Yup me too :/
---
But sot is still a better game
---
TIL his name is *not* "wrecked carcass"
---
Because trans people being at the blunt end of a joke leads to violence and not being taken seriously for politics and healthcare?
---
Then again I suppose you wouldn’t know since you’re not on the receiving end of the stick.
---
Also if you do not like how I present information here, nothing is stopping you from leaving. I however, refuse to budge.
---
All those metal nipples, though...
---
I've noticed an increase in exotics when I come back from not playing for a while. 2 examples: went to florida for a week, came back and immediately got queenbreaker, gwisin vest, and y1 dupe in 1 day. Also, didnt play at all last week, came back Monday this week and got Geomags, Shards of Galanor, and Black Talon all within 5 hours.
---
Big time, I got Skyburner’s Oath and Hard light from ascendant challenge (I think) and blind well respectively one right after the other. 
---
F*ck Titans.
---
Activision 
---
I’m still considering it, the fact that shaders cant be used on exotic weapons is the deterrent tho
---
Ikelos SG is a shotgun. The SMG is called Ikelos SMG. Very confusing!
---
Don’t let it get to that point essentially
---
Do you play on Xbox? Someone on my fl took a bunch of screenshots of her.
---
Why did I think Blue Obama was Rahool? Rahool actually sounds like Obama..way more than Zavala
---
Scumbag Shank. 
---
I do agree there should add a spawn point there. It’s kinda annoying after like 10 times lol the first few times is new and different. But I’m over it now lol
---
/s?
---
Of course I know the SG is the shotgun, I just wanted to point out that MAYBE he put the wrong name 
---
If you miss a shoulder charge, you need to stop playing a Titan. If you fail at that, you need to stop playing a Titan. There's no hope for you 
---
They’re both fun in their own way
---
I will get this pinned after reset tomorrow, on time for the weekend. I'm sure everyone has heard the activision news by now :)
---
I don't have any thing clever to add. I just really enjoyed your comment. 
---
Because he had to.
---
Now that I’ve switched to hunter from maiming titan I know the pain of that stupid titan charge attack. It’s not nearly as much fun being in the receiving end. 
---
WoW is a place before the Khali encounter (1st one) where you can "change" some stuff in the raid.
---
Drifter or failsafe voice over, encounter skips, party headshot sounds, egg spawns, stuff like that.
---
There are 14 wishes revealed/discovered so far.
---
Wish 1 is available once per account, and it gives an extra ethereal key, so a "free" 1k coices try.
---
Just Google it latter, rather ez to find info on
---
Me: *tear rolls down cheek while touching a picture of the ghost shell*
---
RIP
---
Then don't play the Crucible.
---
I’m looking forward to getting it in September 
---
I’d be ok with that 
---
I got Queenbreaker from a gambit match
---
Some weapons need a higher drop chance -_-
---
Lel
---
No worries! Yea, I'm hoping it might be what Xur's bounties will be if nothing else. Would be nice to be able to earn catalysts that are currently just a random drop, and a way to get ones that are not available at the moment like Graviton &amp; Sunshot.
---
Right? I can usually get two or three of them but they evade or kill me before i can get them all. I gotta say though I've gotten better with invading so maybe I'll get there haha.
---
Wait that’s an iron banner weapon?(sorry idk because I’m new to d2)
---
Congratulations on your 1K Voices!
---
Shit. I never imagine them having faces much less souls.
---
There's a reason i hate this damn Ascendant Challenge. It somehow has \*even more\* Taken Phalanxes than usual
---
Uuhm no, but thanks for your input I guess.
---
Hahahah i need ship i have sparrow
---
Just so you guys know hunter way of a thousand cuts melee with double melee and dynamo boots hands on helm is the best melee build in game. Always have near 100 kills per gambit match
---
I ***WISH*** I could afford to use Comic Sans but no, this font is Back Issues.
---
Awesome, well thanks so much for letting me know.  👍
---
hahaha damn I didn't know this.. Ace of Spades has a catalyst ? :o
---
no my first reading was biased by old retconned knowledge u/ltObrien is definetly right about where, and when, it all happened, based on the lore book present it's hard to definitively tell whether I'm still correct as to why they became awoken, though I'd reckon it is as it still fits into the current lore as we know it and wouldn't be something detailed in that book as it follows the crews perspective at the time it happened. Gonna reread the whole book to make sure I'm not missing anything else
---
Drifter
---
Fast travel out.
---
Yeas It is. My brother got that months ago now.
---
gz! how many games did it take you to get the 3 infamy resets for the ghost?
---
After Tuesday, I'll help run the campaigns and adventures.
---
Too. Many. Games. 
---
I'm almost done with reset 5. 
---
I hate Gambit but do it for the gear drops. 
---
Also I wanna say I hate how it says "power based" but doesn't seem to be. 
---
You get the point... don’t need you to go in depth about it 
---
Oh. I thought that was range. They basically look the same. 
---
Two days ago I lost five games in a row, without even winning a single round, WITHOUT EVEN SUMMONING A PRIMEVAL.
---
It was just 4-stacks all night, and for some reason I always had at least one person on my team who collected less than 5 motes and died maybe a dozen times---or they just ran circles in spawn.
---
If you’re using a shotgun in pvp that’s not threat level or ikelos, you’re doing something wrong. 
---
Off of Saladin or a bounty? 
---
Yes but we arent talking about good players. Were talking about the bad players that shouldnt be getting away with this kind of thing.
---
The simplists would be nerfing titan run speeds and slightly for warlocks that would help with the hunters gimped pvp status. (But thats a whole different thing)
---
well it takes 65 consecutive wins (no bounties) to reset once. so we played 200 give or take since we lost ~25 games total ~140 of which have been in the last 2 1/2 weeks.
---
So either you do NOTHING but play D2 OR multiple people share the account, for a single person playing the game, the math just does not add up.
---
The tracer shanks are the opposite
---
I once wrestled a giraffe to the ground with my bare hands
---
\[X\] - Doubt
---
From IB...it's all I'm really grinding for atm. I love the one I have with ricochet rounds, snapshot, kill clip, stability MW.  But I would love to have the OP's roll!
---
I got Breakneck last night!! It dethroned my Tigerspite lol
---
I'm sorry but I am super technologically impaired because I play on console and never figured out how to record other than taking a quick screenshot :(  If I played on PC I would be all over it.
---
Nice photoshop. Maybe next time when you try to pull one over make sure the color bars for the activities match up with the percentages and total time played. At least you added it up to total 100% but a better troll would have made it bungie inspired at 77.77% or something. A for effort though. 👍🏻
---
Not Ace, but tons of the other ones can. Things like Grav Lance, Sunshot, Telesto, Sweet Business, Tractor Cannon,  etc. 
---
He has the destiny bible hiding somewhere else 
---
I have a full choke accurized slideshot rampage and i love it. Pairs great with OEM
---
&gt; Ok have you played the different classes?
---
Yeah?
---
&gt; You would know those boosts hunters get mean jack shit.
---
Okay, that's really kind of your opinion, but whatev.
---
&gt; The jump boost is only notable when you get to mobility 7 and even then its not a lot. You can get more at 8 or 9 but that means giving up regen and damage resistance which means fights are less likely to go your way.
---
So then get 7 mobility and stack resil or recov?
---
&gt; The walkspeed is worthless. The only time you will ever walk in this game is during reloading and if you're reloading out in the open infront of an enemy having faster walk speed wont help you there.
---
I disagree. Reloading and being able to move quickly while doing so is something I very much wish I could do better on my lock and titan. And maybe it's not about reloading in the open? Maybe for some of us it's being able to reload while moving to cover, so we only have to wait in cover for a short amount of time?
---
&gt; The aim down isnt noticble once again seeing even on the slowest titans you can still aim down quickly. If you even do because hip firing is a thing.
---
Titans have the lowest mobility in the game, so increasing your ADS is a direct move against one of their main weaknesses.
---
&gt; And finally the strafe speed. The one thing you will notice but thats more of a luxury than anything else seeing both titans and warlocks arent complaining about theirs.
---
I wholeheartedly disagree. Faster movement is so much better than recovery or resil--there's a reason EVERYONE stacks mobility for PVE and PVP. I've played a shitload of forge and and decided to tweak my gear just to make it easier. When I switched to stacking resil/recovery, I died probably 3 times more often because even with resil/recovery, you need to be in cover or evading to recharge your health. Guess what's harder to do on the fly when you have 5 mobility?
---
Trust your heart
---
It's okay, but I don't see it as good news because I don't know what's causing it. I've only ever seen it do it one time before and that was using Ansel in an area of a game that has a known memory leak with ansel. 
---
its so annoying my man - my friends dont even have all 3 chars at Bergusia and they get it
---
They typically only drop Y1 weapons. I dropped most of my legendary shards in there if I had more then 2000 of them for the last couple of months.
---
Made me chuckle, thanks.
---
no. because i don't have it. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
jk it looks awesome. 
---
Was/is the darkness the hive? Or taken? Or something else?
---
Isn’t there still something coming which will be fought in d3? 
---
Have you been doing the daily bounties every day and never got one rare bounty or you didn't listen to literally every source of destiny news and didn't save one?
---
In any case you can't really be mad at the game. 
---
Yeah just check your drivers, what is your event viewer saying prior to the kernel error.
---
none of the above, the darkness is a separate entitiy
---
and no comment 
---
This is beyond science 
---
Ive gotten a few just from banshee and dev
---
I was hesitant as well, but it's a great subclass. With geo it's good to cut your super short and it will regen really quickly. 
---
This is a Jez meme
---
Not about about kills in zones, it’s about capturing zones lol.
---
Gotcha thanks
---
Dont worry is not that good 
---
Yeah it's pretty annoying the countdowb isn't that little bit longer.
---
Nothing, as I said event viewer only shows that and drivers up to date. 
---
IB? Could please right it out?
---
Is that the murmuration ship? Absolutely love that one. Shaders look super good on it 
---
Fusion rifle frame? 
---
Ever heard the saying in basketball, "theres only one ball"?  Theres only so many kills to be had, you just got more than your fair share....you lost by 5, stop crying
---
Wut.
---
Stop crying git gud 
---
You masterwork it up to 7 I believe
---
Exact same thing happened to me and I can't explain it. 
---
I think it's worth trying out every single subclass, just so you are familiar with them all and what they can do. 
---
Chaos reach can take a bit of getting used to, since it is hard to see around the laser, so you have to be very aware of where enemies are beforehand. Out of all the new supers, it is my favourite. 
---
Chaos reach is great for melting bosses, that's about it.  
---
Its really kinda useless for anything else in my opinion
---
Quit crying 
---
Git gud? Have you seen the screenshot?
---
Ahoy, Ahoy, Ahoy. There Be skeletons on tha deck. Bring a Musket!
---
They got gud. Now you do the same
---
You need to complete 2 purple quests that you can re-purchase from Ana before she gives you sleeper and nascent dawn quests.
---
r/woosh   
---
wasnt the point. I've had more chances and bear no fruit. im very aware i'm not guaranteed it, Jotunn has a relatively high drop-rate, in 12 attempts i haven't had it, thats "unlucky", i feel unlucky.
---
Got 3 from turning in tokens yesterday 
---
Gwisin got nerfed and spectral is getting nerfed too so...?
---
Titan or hunter imo but I have seen some really good warlock parkour. It's just their jump has a steep learning curve
---
This never happens to me.
---
If we get a leaver in Gambit, the other team just goes tryhard and teabags. 
---
Blatant rip off 
---
Thanks
---
Lo key, Destiny has some absolutely amazing lore that I think most fans don't appreciate.  
---
It’s easy for everyone to reach 4-5 mil as long as you do the damage phases right, especially for GG, damn it breaks the damage limit when you get synergy
---
Killa queen daisan no bakudan bites za dusto
---
Personal foul on rare for copying the drifter 15 mill to bungie 
---
RIP cockass 
---
At least this Cayde has 9 lives ;)
---
I just got forsaken today but I always see people saying the QBB is OP in gambit. How so?
---
😂💯
---
My bad omegalul I’m blind. Imagine doing that bad tho holy hell. 0 motes banked 
---
I too feel that this exists. At some point you will get the drop but for that to happen you don't necessarily have to grind continuously 24/7. If you pace it out it seems to have a better chance of dropping. 
---
Hazard of the cast and Ringing Nail are solid as well 
---
*PORB*
---
It's all about how good you are at using it and what obstacle you're looking to overcome. They're is no "wins in every possible situation" jump for this game. They all have pros and cons.
---
Am I the only one thinking that might make Sea a little more fun?
---
I’m not sure if she has it. It came from as etched(?) engram 
---
For sure!
---
Lol, it really do be like that sometimes. What's the point of having 7+ mobility when a Titan can skate across the map in 4 seconds and one shot MELEE me or shotgun me in the dome? People like to complain about Blade Barrage and Gwisin but tend to forget suppressor grenades, one shot melee, and a Titan super that counters both, lmao
---
I have to look, but i like the gun
---
and? this dude is flexing with terrible stats. and it looks like only one dude was playing, maybe the others only showed up for the end.... I wouldn't try either. Plus if my theory is correct, that means he would own as an invader. that's like flexing on someone who is trying to get side arm kills and you are using meta weapons.  
---
Would love to help because I need to do it too but I'm on Xbox
---
Thank you for the assistance guardian 
---
Yeah you know the ones:
---
* The burning guts one so that you can melting point after melting point in raids
---
* The Daft punk hat that lets you get around whilst Thor-smashing
---
* And I hear something about an acorn shaped beanie that covers one eye in PVP.
---
Damaging him worked for me on my Titan two weeks ago. There were 4 guardians there, I did a little damage with a couple shotgun shots from Toil and Trouble, and then backed off and let the other randoms finish the guy. Got credit for the quest step.
---
Might have something to do with causing a certain amount of damage, or causing actual health damage vs shield damage, but you can definitely get it without being the one to deal the finishing blow.
---
True dat
---
Okay, now ladies!
---
E
---
T
---
Nailed it
---
there should be a middle ground while i dont like the extremely low drop chance of raid exotics, i also dont want everybody to run around with it since it takes away the special thing about it.
---

---
I just have one question, why have air intakes on a ship made for space travel?
---
no ur good 
---
shoulder charge is your main weapon in pvp
---
Alright, alright, alright. Skelly boobs on the field!
---
r
---
This is what i want aswell and this could be easily reached just by buffing the drop rates a small amount or just drastically improving dupe protection,drastically improving dupe protection would keep exotics rare but just make them more worth grinding for so i dont get my 5th wings of sacred dawn in 2 weeks
---
Spam melee
---
I just got destiny 2 two weeks ago, and got my first character (hunter) to 600. I made a warlock and titan but haven’t touched them yet. I asked some clan mates I’ve been playing with if I should just focus on getting my hunter to 650 first, or try to play all three at once. They all said to get to 650 first
---
Then I started thinking.... what about all the extra enhancement cores I can get, along with the daily/weekly quests? 
---
Yeah I had no ballistics log during reset on Tuesday. I completed both weeklies for the logs and I did one powerful heavy machine gun frame. After completion and going to Ada to use my second log she only had silver frame quests and only two of them.

If you’re a hunter, play shadowshot and support, no point in blade barraging if they don’t kill the envoys. If you tether well, they can’t help but kill them! Kill the blockers with a shotgun/fusion to make sure it’s free. 
---
If nobody else invades, make sure you do. Even if you don’t kill them, slowing them down putting motes in is still super helpful. 
---
Good luck! 
---
Nah, Petras should be required and they're fixing it. There are ways to prevent a guitar. Without ruining your Petras. Like giving first runner fireteam lead or making sure you remove all bricks you can see in vault before riven. Its an issue with a known cause. You can circumvent it. Or wait till it its fixed late january early February like they announced.
---
Uhhh... because. Because they're space intakes! Yeah, I'll go with that. I have no idea what else they could be to be honest. I'm not very fancy on engineering or anything so I have no clue other than maybe the artist thought they looked cool? And because space magic.
---
Would agree

“You sound like Lord Shaxx”

HA! Finally someone stand up for Titan againsts shotgun! Punch is always best dps! Keep up good punch Titan!

“Lord Shaxx sounds like me”

I'm more a purist to the ThunderLord myself also. Its gotta be that OG skin for me.

GHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

I read that as "force akin."
---
Base game means no DLC. No Curse of Osiris, no Warmind, no Forsaken, no Black Armory. Missing out on a lot, but 
---
Sorry. Pulse not fusion 🙄
---
I don't get how people use this thing in pvp, the ammo just goes away so quickly, do you have tips on using it in pvp?
---
Damn Daniel, nice vans.
---
I feel ya man, played hundreds of strikes and still have yet to get the Riskrunner catalyst, most of the sources say it’s all rng based.

---
I couldn't get Forsaken until a month after release. Sucks to be left behind. I hope you at least got the Solstice of Heroes stuff so you can hit Power Level 400.
---
To this day, I have never truly been as intrigued by any piece of lore, so much as back when we were slowly uncovering new information about this superiour nefarious race, the Mahjarrat, and the ritual that called them all to the ritual marker hidden away in the mountains every 500 years. Just describing it gives me goosebumps, I still love the lore but like all things, theyre usually better when you know less.
---
WAKANDA FOREVER!
---
Wait base game players can get to 400 now?
---
I get all that. But how do you prevent what happened to me today? You literally can’t. It was just some bug because the encounter is so glitchy and bad. And to loose because of game error is so frustrating. Guitar is one thing. But what happened today? That’s ridiculous. You have 2 glitches you need to worry about, and one is literally something you can’t fix or prevent from happening. It just random if the game decides to screw you. It’s not right
---
It's a laser the same family as coldhart and Prometheus lens. But I did not know this exsisted either before today.

Absolutely agree, for me it peaked when I started seeing it all come together and the God Wars were erupting again, the end of Guthix, Sliske and Zamorak squabbling of the Stone of Jas, whispers of the Elder Gods, Mah and her children, Zaros and Seren.
