Thanks for all the replys guys. Ill tell him ill sherpa if he needs. I personally would have done it just to help out and maybe gain a follower or two but if its a bannable offense ill tell him i cant. Once again thank you for all the help!

No hand cannons are the one true gun there can never be to many 
---
I'd also like to propose that they add more activities that have a boosted exotic chance. It seems like all we have now is that spider bounty. People would probably be less mad about the lack of exotics dropping if we had something that let us say "maybe this time."
---
What do you guys think?
---
As a fervant user of Fighting Lion in Crucible, I've eaten shit to my own grenades more than once.
---
I didn't play killzone, it's a character ? :)
---
Avalanche is still garbo. If you have access to a Hammerhead, you use Hammerhead over Avalanche every time.
---
True of any roaming super. If you shit yourself and let the warlock pulse gleefully through the map withoit resistance of course it will go to town. Not sure what the Nerf will do honestly but if it becomes "lose to every super" like every other warlock super it's going to be pretty sad. 
---
When people were first getting ahold of the random drop bounty for thorn the special mission at the end was very hard yes
---

---
Pretty much everyone had trouble with it at first 
---
It can... with a fire team full of izangis 
---
Because the explosion radius is bs. 
---
Will thorn and last word be available to people who don’t have the annual pass?
---
Worth. Now you have a dildo business.
---
Send your Xbox clips to OneDrive, open OneDrive on your phone and download. That’s what I do without a recording software. It’s kind of a hassle, and can take upwards of an hour to upload to OneDrive based on how long the clip is, but it works.
---
Just wait until Joker’s Wild. It’s gonna be pure hell.
---
I’ve gotten 3 Frost-EE5’s in the last week so...
---
The change won't change much.
---
Helghast are like space nazis I was trying to say the gun looks like their primary assault rifle
---
I loved Of Mice and Men
---
*Screams in HP*
---
And you would fan the LW by smacking the hammer with thorn 😂
---
Yeah. You're right. I guess they could also make factions joinable at all times and just have special rewards during faction wars.
---
You never go FullDan
---
Mida multi tool crucible users need to unite against the Titans!
---
Because every video was from launch and masterworking wasnt at launch. Check time stamps before you make a reddit post.
---
Hey man, I’d be down to help you out if you’re still looking for a 3rd. 
---
Ah yes... the facti9n catalysts that they Actually said that there will be other ways to obtain them afterwards.. and here we are.. ffs.
---
I'm a new player and have no clue what the hype.is about. Can someone fill me in please.
---
Most probably just the last part, so do riven with 4 pieces of the armour 
---
Your we're 
---
Did you stroke out writing that comment?
---
When you stub your toe
---
650 hunter here. I find spectral blades to be the most broken super in game atm. Invisibility, avoid radar detection, see through walls, fast as fuck, lasts forever. If you use Gwisin Vest in 6v6 you can almost keep your  super up indefinitely. How is this super not needed before nova warp?
---
That's great news, thank you for the heads up! 
---
Black armory gear = Forge armor 
---
Hunter is Woven Firesmith set
---
Titan is Forged Machinist set
---
Warlock is Annealed Shaper set 
---
Should’ve pledged a better faction ;)
---
Well yeah I guess there’s that but I was just stating what bungie has spoken about so I was just making sure no one was getting there hopes up ? 
---
So no legitimate rebuttal. Got it.
---
had it a couple months back but got rif of it when i did the thunderlord quest
---
And there is a light increase it’s going to 700 as stated 
---
MonkaS
---
Plus graviton lance I think
---
No, it's the new exotic throwing knives
---
Still doesn’t come up in recently discovered, if you’ve had it at all, ever, on this account then it won’t show up there
---
Thunderlord is, honestly, a little ridiculous.
---
I wish it were a bit less so because I'd like to carry a different exotic sometimes, but melting a whole room full of adds with three rounds from a 62 round magazine is just...what I like.
---
I don’t know why you’re being downvoted, the title just straight up isn’t true...
---
Oof that sensitivity 
---
I do have QB. I used to use it. Now I find it more beneficial to run a sword in the power slot to help take out primeval envoys easily. My best Gambit match I got 27 I believe with QB and done about as well with Izanagi’s. I still think without a doubt Izanagi’s is a better option because of the damage output, the one shot capability and the much more availability of special ammo. If some asshole pushes you off power ammo and you don’t get a lucky drop you’re screwed.
---
If you lose your gunfights, 90% of exotics are useless you top class melt. 
---
The avalanche sounds pretty cool though
---
Yes.
---
in march
---
never been in d1, what is so op about thorn?
---
idk the lore, can someone explain what in this trailer actually confirms this gun from D1? ( i didnt play D1) It shows last word gameplay then says "every hero needs a villain" 
---
The stone wall's playing aztec dubstep
---
It was also a quest in year 3
---
Don't worry, we're just gonna switch to dawnblade and rain fire upon the unsuspecting fools
---
its cuz all D1 nerds love handcannons
---
You are just to retarded to understand I guess. Keep bitching about comp. And git gud 
---
I know for a fact that up to the forges it dropped from legendary engrams, if it’s not in your collection then they changed it from  then on.
---
whatever you say bud
---
Then I assume you don't play crucible enough to experience the pain of almost killing a titan while hi kills your ally and instantly heals plus over shields, not mentioning higher damage and having a wall hack
---
The PC player base is huge. I think I saw that it was bigger than the player base on Xbox. So i'd say its completely worth buying on pc. But that it ultimately up to you!
---
Pc is the future for destiny, almost all major content creators jumped to pc.
---
How about triple wield? Anyone remember that?
---
What? The recently discovered bit is for new stuff only
---
Yes! I would love a militia
---
I’m aware of the pain you speak of and I have experienced it but I guess not enough to hate it 
---
Just seeing if you can apply the same questions to yourself, it’s clear you cannot. Thank you for keeping me entertained this afternoon 
---
Some people stand against truth. Beware guardian. 
---
Yeah fair enough just went back and saw it never mind I was wrong sorry 
---
nope
---
It gives you Black Armory, Joker’s wild, and Penumbra. 
---
Playing on someone else’s account is a bannable offense? Wow, crazy. How do all these people selling recovs get away with it. There are whole fancy websites dedicated to it. 
---
yup
---
And Ice Breaker
---
And they laughed at me for finding for what seemed like 3rd weeks straight to get all three catalysts. Whose laughing now. 
---
Maybe you didn't get the joke OEM=One Eye'd Mask
---
F
---
** buff weapons from other archetypes!
---
Solid advice here. See my other comment on helping clan mates carry their friends. 
---
Please open that mf door
---
That sounds cool! Thank you very much.
---
What is that shader and how do I get it? Asking for a friend
---
Honestly, that's what Mayhem should be. Just complete and utter chaos 
---
It’s fun the loot is good too
---
Xboxclios.com
---
Yay! Rehashing more stuff from D1, how original! 
---
Me leik gravition lanco for no reason.
---
Me just leik.
---
Something the community wanted, nothing wrong with that. Move on with your negativity
---
Keep your helmet on?
---
I really wish I had the annual pass :( 
---
Dark fluorescence, from festival of the lost event
---
You're right so Dust Rock
---
Yes you only buy it once unless you switch platforms(xbox one, PS4, Pc). I personally would say it’s worth since it’s a years worth of content for 35$ which isn’t that bad, however that decision is based off your opinion. Would you want to keep destiny? Do you enjoy it? Are you willing to grind for items?
---
Well when I'm doing forges I tend to throw the batteries at the little wing things because I'm usually at an angle but today it got stuck inbetween the wing and the main body 
---
Welp, guess I’ll never be able to experience the raw power of a nerf hammerhead
---
Literally the first game I ended up in last night, very painful. 
---
Well done chief
---
Thanks 😂😂
---
Pretty sure it's easier to upload a picture from your phone than from your console.
---
Yeah like I said below it took em about a year I think.
---
I absolutely understand that. I am all for the spectral nerf even though I run it cuz it’s so broken. But yeah I absolutely hate going against OEM, it’s basically 4 exotics wrapped into 1. I definitely don’t think BB needs a nerf, maybe on the amount you get back from shards but BB itself is fine. BB most the time is 1-2 kills. Every once in a while you’ll get lucky but I think it has its place. 
---
Why is he a meme now?
---
Thanks! 
---
Replace that with *chance for a Forsaken exotic*
---
Noreastor is a  really cool dude , we were in a clan together, no longer are but we still play together. Goes to show there are some decent guardians out there 
---
I haven't done it either since nobody I know plays D2. :(
---
but muh immersion 
---
FuckinG FINALLY. but what about OEM?
---
Rat king
---
Immerse your characters head in to the helmet.
---
Pretty sure it will count for you. 
---
I don’t fallow?
---
I’d settle for just getting it. 
---
Oh yeah, completely forgot about that.
---
Would be good to have an exotic sidearm that could work on its own
---
If you play on PC I'd love to join your fireteam! DM me if you'd like :)
---
Are you like crazy or something? You clearly missed the joke so you start commenting about pizza for some fucking reason and decide to sink with the ship that is the original comment
---
Yes please
---
We looking for new clan mates! Just joined a little while ago, and they've been super helpful and really chill. 
---
"Spicy Ramen Enthusiasts" is the clan name. And we're always down to do anything.
---
Hello! It would be awesome! Although I don't play as much as most people. I can spend maybe 3-4 hours a day, but I can do more.
---
I think it’s a bug. I’ve ran it like 4 times now and still hasn’t completed the quest. Apparently it’s a known issue. You can see it happening to a lot of others if you google it.
---
By any chance is the character your trying to do the quest up forsaken boosted? Mine currently is and I think that might be the issue. 
---
wholesome post, I hope your dad friends the friends he’s looking for! I would help but I play on PC 😪
---
So we can confirm a 3 tap to the head. That warlock dawnblade would have to have been low or else that could be busted.
---
1986-2000 I believe, almost all of us are millennials.
---
This is a great idea.  Maybe different targets with different elements.

#JUST LET IT DIE ALREADY REEEEEEEE
---
For real. they were the first exotics I got in 2 weeks.
---
Sorry what?
---
All i see is that new shitty fusion rifle from the forge, you can't even kill anybody with a basic weapon anymore
---
The worst gun in the gaming history- 8/10 IGN
---
My best was 11 in 5 days, but then i got a slump
---
I hope to do it soon
---
Wow
---
well it depends  where you are starting at (light level, armor and wepons) mostly light level and if you’ve never done any you should start with Eater Of Worlds ( D2 Raid ) My first raid ever found it pretty easy I’m pretty sure the light level is around (350?)
---
The sparrow Warrior's Steed is gone
---
Those and vanguard tokens do transfer. I think Iron Banner tokens don't, but I'm not sure about that as I have never done Iron Banner.
---
Bungie:  "Ok we need to learn from our mistakes and build a balanced game to make everything fair."

Also Bungie: *Rolls out the two most game-breaking guns in Destiny's history within 6 months of the each other*

What character do you main? Do you have a cluster rocket launcher? Do you have the EP shotty Ikelos, Sleeper Stimulant, Whisper of the Worm?
---
They're second only to The Architects when it comes to responsibility for Guardian deaths.
---
Also Bungie: *Rolls out the two most game-breaking guns in Destiny's history within 6 months of each other*
---
They didnt nerf gwisin vest
---
I just got mine last night from also doing a spider bounty
---
Not as much as it hip firing a grenade out the air
---
You forgot NF and any shotty in the energy slot
---
Death's about to get his ass kicked
---
I did the exact same thing.  Found a cool portal thingie and dove right in.  I later learned on accident from falling down the wormhole of D2 videos how special of an event it was and how I still have no whisper

Just need the sparrow and ghost shell for curse breaker
---
Hate when that happens
---
Atleast have him and the guardian fix up some timeline disruption caused by the vex by going back to the past in this ftanchise's iconic moments and raids which would then give us harder, more difficult versions of D1 and D2 raids.
---
As long as it is within the season.
---
Yeah I always do them but the ONLY exotic drop I’ve gotten for PC so far is jade rabbit. I have graviton lance, ace of spades, sunshot, risk runner, and vigilance wing of course none of those were drops but awuirable rewards from “factions” for the hundreds of hours I’ve put into D2 have given me literally one drop. Not even an armor piece (except on Xbox one I get armor drops ALL the time and I’ve only gotten raspberry, illegally modified holster, and ACD/0 from aquirabilities on PC) 
---
The game literally hates me, I’ve been stuck at power level 548 for months now and I play way too much.
---
i think thats just to get the quest dropped
---
Yeah, I’ve found their the best way of getting exotics.
---
The first thorn was a monster. Then it was nerfed , twice. Which iteration we get, probably the weakest. F*ck the Last Word. Hate that crap. Change my mind
---
Ah ok that makes sense. I was kinda worried 
---
I love gambit, problem is I’m stuck at lift level 548 so everyone kills me in one to two shots and I can’t do anything
---
Some dude literally killed me in one shot with ballyhook from a good distance. RIP hunter wolfentodd.
---
That was awesome and you're the reason I hate blade barrage and the crucible.
---
Thank you! And I believe they do, I completed the Iron Fellowship set last year, and I kept doing bounties and was able to claim the tokens again this past January when it came back
---
They fixed its broken bug and nerfed its super. I think that counts as a nerf...
---
Nope, its radiolarian pudding
---
Eyes up guardian 
---
It only works on iPhone?!
---
Although all the planetary vendors are non-combat zones kind of like the tower, so it may not be super difficult. Just depends on exactly how the designed it I guess, if they left themselves a way to easily make that type of adjustment 
---
Unfortunately yes
---
I have one warlock, haven't done a raid since leviathan, haven't unlocked the last forge, have wife and child, have all non activity based forsaken exotics. You should be better at rng
---
It will in now way be time gated sooo yeah you guys are wrong, no RNG no nothing, you can do it in one day if you really want....
---
Hell nah. Never to late. Here, if you are someone that plays this shit 24/7 it's so worth it. You will get so much done. You will just have everything. If you are someone that works a lot and cant play an hour. That's fine. Little by little you will make progress on getting shit. Trust me. I got it late. I have school. I play an hour a day. Boom! I'm stacked. :)
---
Make crucible an enjoyable experience?
---
Are weapons season exclusive? As in if I want to get Izanagi's Burden next season will I get it?
---
Oh my you are right, couple of weeks ago some guy posted here with 70k! Insane. 
---
I fell you on being 1 off from titles. I’m 1 off cursebreaker, wayfarer and chronicler (this is more of a time gate issue). But hate being one off and rely on super heavy rng :/ can’t get that damn ghost shell, nor the sleeper node side arm from mars. Lol
---
I've had that happen way too many times 😂
---
I was alone lmao
---
Well, yes. If you buy annual pass now or tomorrow. You get that shitty quest. But simply. Yes you will be able to get Izangi's Burden. No, they are most likely not season exclusive.
---
How about last season? Is it also exclusive to that season?
---
parked in walmart parking lot loll
---
 God roll ringing nail and God roll threat level. Muah!
---
I wish I could upvote into Oblivion 
---
Yes they do
---
Are you concerned that shotguns can wreck them too?  Last word has shit range, if you're popping a super that close, you're in danger no matter what.
---
It stays in every single season. It will stay in forever. 
---
Well, as they said,"legends will rise" you my friend are one of them
---
I see. I might as well when the money is there haha. Idk when though.
---
I reckon that’d be useful probably let people try out exotic weapons as well so people know what’s out there in the wild or raids ?
---
Damn, why you do him like that? He spent his last 99,999 glimmer on those AirPods... smh 
---
Underrated 
---
Well, take you're time! If you have enough and you're sure. Go for it!
---
Yes it’s bad, you are supposed to read it I’m jofferys voice
---
It doesn't count over multiple seasons, if you don't complete the triumph this season you have to get fabled again next season 
---
Right now I'm torn between a graphics card and paying my debt, so I might during s6. Thanks!
---
Is that an HOUR? Cause there’s no way that’s accurate. I’ve been kicked from strikes when I get up to take a shower, and that takes me about 15 minutes. 
---
Was your friend totally AFK the entire time, along with not turning his controller back on, and not moving his joysticks if he has a tv/monitor that dims when not in use?

I’m around 630-640 on all my characters and I’ve been getting a ton of cores ever since a few days ago. 
---
Don’t sit so close.
---
Oh shit mybad op just checked and it was just in Destiny memes, i kinda feel bad 
---
Agreed
---
I remember it shooting way faster but hey ill trust ya
---
Congratulations. Hit 650 on all 3 today. Still have 1 new sub class on Warlock and Hunter to unlock. 
---
I've never even done a raid and I'm pissed for them
---
Oh shit, bro got himself a John Deere!!
---
There are exotics designed for pvp not for pve. 
---
So to make sure I understand... The Red and the Blue Square on either side of the White square was part of the design?
---
It's not even top tier anymore so meh. 
---
Congrats guardian! I need to make a Warlock and a Titan, just haven't gotten around to doing it yet haha
---
nah, don't be, thanks for looking out.
---
obviously scripted
---
That’s what Bungie should do with the farm
---
Does he wanna be my bf also? Lol jk jk 
---
UwU wholesome post
---
Dude Heroic public events are random 
---
There were kells in destiny 1. Whole expansion was on a kell
---
It was a random my friend and I were waiting for him to come back so we could kill the boss
---
Dreaming City:
---
- blind well [2x heroic] + Oracle
---
- weekly mission
---
- ascendant challenge
---
- shattered throne if available

- 100% completion

Other randoms:
---
- spider powerful wanted bounty
---
- 2x Ada powerful frames for 1 Ada powerful armor piece
---
- do both raids if possible
---
If you ever played destiny in pc... and the. Tried playing on Console... you’d quickly switch back to console.. game is unplayable on console. 
---
180 HCs are a 4-tap, excluding Luna’s/NF. Last Word (seems to) fire at 200 RPM. The fact it can 3-tap is pretty crazy for this sandbox, but I imagine it is hip-fire only that can do that. Maybe more people will finally use scouts with their buff incoming, and so they’ll have the distance to counter TLW.
---
But yeah, numbers are nice. It is a trailer though, and numbers look bad in a cinematic Machinima-style video, even if they’d be nice to have.
---
When you finish please do Monte Carlo if you can
---
Here is the end game screen
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Ah the way I read that was like your friend was like “Hey time me I’m gonna go AFK”. 
---
An hour though seems crazy, I know if you do nothing in Crucible and Gambit then they kick you in about 3-5 minutes if you’re just standing there, I bet this guy was just doing what most of the people I’ve seen in strikes do, and just checking on his game and moving his stick around so he could get free rewards. 
---
I remember getting the jumping part down after a few tries thinking “pfft i can prob solo the fight”... boy was i wrong
---
Thank you!! I will copy it and tape it on my wall or some shit. 
---
I watched the vid, then continued to binge and go down a rabbit hole that led to 3 compilations of animals jumping off thins while Painkiller Man played
---
I’m already getting ptsd from hunter and lastword spam. Made me quit the game from how much garbage that was 
---
Np! I didn't include gambit/crucible/vanguard stuff bc those are marked with the gold sunbursts on your map. 
---
Basically it is the ultimate anti-super weapon. Even when not in super, it kills players just by sending them into walls.
---
And for PvE, it makes your elemental weapons 33% stronger (for void weapons even 50%). It lasts for 10 seconds AND you move faster for a while.
---
So it's a pretty good exotic, especially against bosses and supers. The catalyst for it gives it even more ammo and you find that simply by playing the game fighting regular enemies. It's random.
---
Its easy now though use companion app to find a fireteam
---
&gt;and raids aren't really bumping me up
---
The exact same activities that got you from 500 to where you are now are how you keep increasing your power. 
---
Powerful gear drops are calculated based on the average of all the highest gear you own, not individual pieces, so if your gear is very uneven in power level that would be why you are getting downgrades. Only Last Wish gives powerful gear, out of all the raids you have access to. 
---
Every single source of powerful gear gives you items at least 1 above your average highest power level, even up to the cap. 
---
So that’s where mine went!
---
Awesome. What is EVA foam?
---
I’ve been playing since year 1 and getting an exotic then was just “oh cool I have it now” but now getting a Forsaken exotic warrants a “I FINALLY GOT IT!!!”
---
It's ok I'm here for u
---
I want more stickers!!!!
---
Six shooter Goldie main since day 1 brother
---
I still havent even completed third forge cause i got burnt out they seem so annoying to do tbh... but i want jotunn

"It's nerf or nothing"
---
Depending on which version of these guns you're getting, it's possible you only think you're sick of hand canons. Both Thorn and Last Word are so so much worse then normal hand canons potentially. 
---
It moves from day to day. 
---
I just played a game where I dropped four tens, but the second I go for a 15, I pick up the 15th and IMMEDIATELY WITHOUT FAIL is an invader with either queenbreaker or Crooked Fang
---
Get the fuck up you pizza shit.
---
I feel that on a personal level.
---
In theory he's super dead... But so was Uldren so... 
---
Why didn't you warn the Americans about 9/11 you sick fuck
---
Just wait till you get wife. Try to explain to her, that no, you can't just pause the game... 
---
Atleast your whole team didn't get blasted in the face by a wardcliff coil while yall in spawn
---
If you’re into auto rifles I recently rediscovered Null Calamity 9 and dropped 30 kills in my second game using it
---
lol
---
This is true. For that I am greatful
---
that ain't safe and we all know it
---
That's just a daily bounty, you don't need to do it. Yes it counts toward the weekly bounty but you need to do 8 daily bounties to complete the weekly and earn that powerful gear. You get 5 dailies per day so just choose the easiest 4 from that. And again the next day. And you are done.
---
Niice yeahhh!
---
Honestly, itd even be a silly and fun idea for a mayhem game. It's already broken af, why not go balls to the walls. 
---
I’ll try it out. What are you running as secondary and heavy?
---
I scrolled over every adventure and it wasn’t appearing anywhere in edz
---
So you’ve heard 😝😝😝
---
I thought it was...
---
NERF or NOTHING
---
Actually Null Calamity 9 is the secondary. I have either Bygones or Better Devils as my primary but don’t use it much because NC9 has a pretty decent range
---
Sorry I can’t help farther :( 
---
Most of the time we blow the whole wad on one guardian. Its about sending a message.

No, but i have been sent through time and space once.
---
Guys. Listen. It’s OKAY to play other games than Destiny. It’s not cheating because it’s not alive. While it may bring you joy and happiness it does not give your life meaning or fulfill some empty void in your life.
---
It is OKAY to play other games lol. You don’t have to kick and scream at other games when they come out.
---
Unless you genuinely don’t think Anthem looks cool then, fine. You do you. But come on, Anthem looks so good. That shit has the potential to be the next hot title.
---
what alarm app is that?
---
I thought sidviks did?
---
I can help with nightfalls if you want, gamer tag is iTwon -) 
---
Nova warp is good right out of the box so it got the early whine momentum, seems once people start they don't stop til they see the patch hit.  With forsaken exotic drop rates most people didn't have Gwisin till recently so most people didn't even use spectral blades. 
---
will be interesting to see what happens in the next few weeks. 
---
If there is an RNGesus out there then Thorn will be tied to going Legendary, so Competitive can disappear down an event horizon of unobtainable hand-cannons guarded and used by four-stacks just murdering each other ad finitum.
---
I think one of the dawning shells is called jasper dawn shell? 
---
F for outlaw perk and reload masterwork. 360 rpm is very interesting though. Might not need as much stability as the fast firing rifles. Definitely worth keeping imo.

also the dailies, basically if there is a gold star on the planet map, do it. spider, petra, and the drifter also have bounties for powerful rewards
---
I totally forgot about consoles, is it a big issue there too? 
---
Oh here we see hunters in their natural habitat: in a river of tears cuz! 
---
last word only im affraid
---
spot on. the factions have different ideals:   
---
New Monarchy wants to unite Humanity under one banner. They are very justice orientated and aim to treat everyone as equal, helping those that were left with nothing after Ghauls attack. Basically strength through resilience and unity  
---
Future War Cult has seen visions of even greater threats that seek the travellers light and urges humanity to prepare now before its too late, like it was when Ghaul attacked. They are basically aiming for an arms race against the threats yet to come. Strength through foresight and preperation  
---
Dead Orbit sees the traveler as a threat and is convinced that as long as they stay near it, they will suffer from the forces of darkness that seek its power, basically taking Ghauls attack as an omen. They say that the earth and the last city will be destroyed eventually in the war between light and darkness and that humanity should turn its back to the travelers light and colonize the universe before it is too late. Strength through exploration and independence  
---
During the Faction Rallies, activities earned you faction tokens which you were able to exchange for reputation packages. Based on the number of packages claimed, you were able to unlock more stuff. At first this included some weapons, shaders and armor pieces, which later expanded into armor ornaments, more shaders and more weapons.  
---
The Faction who had the most packages claimed at the end of the event was the victor, and to the victor go the spoils. Each rally, there was one weapon that was only avaiable if the faction won. If you were part of the winning faction you could buy it once for 1 glimmer. If you already got your "free" copy or werent part of the faction it cost 50k glimmer instead. Thankfully, these weapons never were a necessity for any gamemode so you werent forced to get the weapon (it also got added to the lootpool of the next rally).

&gt;Season 1
---
*crys in Forsaken* :(
---
Ask them to join your fireteam. Problem solved. 
---
What perks are those.?. How can you tell which perks they are? I've been playing since D1 and I've never been able to tell what rolls they are without scrolling over them
---
but what would there supers be? would they even know any raids? 
---
iirc, GG is the only super that doesn't get any damage reduction.
---
Same here actually. Got that one back when i started playing and i hate myself for having stopped until Forsaken. Missed out on so much stuff... 
---
Same questions queuing with blueberries, so no harm letting them join, right?
---
I thought this was odd too, season of the Forge has had by far the least amount of weapons. Could've atleast refreshed vendors and such. 
---
You tried
---
the face chewing TBH
---
So happy this dumbass dogshit no skill crutch is getting nerfed next with the wave splitter. I'd like to see them try me in comp again. 
---
Ah, like the dreaming city?
---
like, we did, we did Blind Well / Raid / Visited Mara for other subclasses, what are you on about?
---
Are you sure? could of sworn I got the sweet business catalyst the other day.
---
Sorry man. I guess I was extra extra good in 2018! As opposed to some of you... ;)
---
But don't worry, you will get there!
---
that's... not a word, but ok.
---
It says something like :,,Found by pledging to the seekers of Monarchy", so yeah pretty sure. If you did, do tell tho lol
---
Not sure why you're being down voted, it is a helmet that MARKS ENEMIES, INCREASES DAMAGE, AND GIVES YOU INSTANT OVERSHEILDS.
---
It doesn't matter if skating works or not, nothing changes the fact that it is a one man army with way more than enough advantages to guarantee you a win in any 2v1 if you're not brain dead. 
---
There are some packages in Eververse you can buy, which contain Whisper of the Worm or Thunderlord ornaments and some goodies for 700 silver a piece. The temporary packages always cost like 1100-1650 so thats unfortunate. I If you don't like anything, just keep it. Buying engrams is not that efficient imo. 
---
Yes so I think Apparently I have don’t shoot...
---
Thorn won't be out until Jokers Wild
---
If you don't like you can scroll past
---
Lol keep scrolling couples play games to...
---
&gt;:(
---
What are you talking about? Plenty people loved the movie, tho its quite underrated imo
---
I can feel this pic: The hate, the anger just every thing!
---
I'm new-ish to the game and a long time player friend of mine walked me through it the other day. We had a rando with us from the forums too. Took us two tries.
---
They ran on ahead and started clearing the rooms while I got through the jumping puzzle. I caught up when they were like halfway through the 2nd one.
---
That music tho.
---
Also there's a shortcut through the grey room apparently. Our rando didn't know, and he had a laugh at his own expense. Drastically shortens the time in the puzzle.
---
Why be negative? If you don't like something just move on... Couples play games together. Hell we met playing games. 
---
It's getting a nerf to be like baseline fusions in PvP but with better optics, chill, it wasnt not even that good
---
Thank God they aren't touching it PvE
---
Sorry, should have clarified. I’m working on my 300 precision kills for the catalyst. Just wondering how close I am.
---
You've come to a subreddit dedicated to the game saying it's boring as hell 
---
Do I need to spell it out for you as to why that's asinine 
---
A 3rd person shooter more focused on abilities rather than gunplay? 
---
"Hello there, meet my fist!"
---
LOL :D
---
Amen! Just need a chestpiece.)
---
You know what? I’m gonna be straight forward with you. I have not logged into D2 since a little before they handed out the veteran bundle for purchasing Forsaken. Everyone has their time and I guess mine has finally come. I won’t go into detail but...I just cannot help but feel sad and upset right now if I were to log into D2. I miss D1 so much. It’s a whole thing. Jesus Christ I sound like I’ve broken up with someone.
---
Anyways, to answer your question, I don’t lol. That would most definitely be a task of tasks. Who knows, maybe one day I will be juggling Anthem 2 and D3. Buy for now I’ve hung up my light and I may be checking out Tarsis to see what’s up. That being said though, I will ALWAYS and forever be a Guardian first and foremost. Specifically Warlock. [cue the moans and growns].
---
Juggling two live service games would be pretty tough. I tried Warframe but it wasn’t my thing. That was over a year ago though so maybe I should try again? Idk.
---
As a hint for the 3rd forge. Use riskrunner for it. Hell lot of fun with it since the proc is up all the time and it melts even the yellow bars.
---
Ill trade ya i get more kills for my brodsword on control maps 
---
I made a shit post specifically shitting on these kinds of posts...but this one made me chuckle
---
Ya, I come by time to time to check out any updates/announcements they make. 
---
Check bungie forums

Ha ha I am ready for trade:)
---
Many thanks
---
This is what works for us, rumor has it the vault encounter memory hog is what causes guitar when you load the area. 
---
After you finish vault, change guns, shoot up all your ammo and have the whole team pick up their ammo bricks, engrams, and orbs.  It frees up all the instance memory when they reuse the room. 
---
No guitars since we started doing it, and we didn’t rush grabbing the heart until we switched load outs and rallied 
---
Omg why have you shoot ?
---
You should have dont shooted .
---
Cool story bro.
---
Just the trust?
---
N00b!
---
This man knows D2. Have an upvote! :)
---
You could also just hover your cursor over the catalyst on the weapon and it will tell you how far along you are.  
---
Some people just don't understand software development sprints cycles and just looove talking shit.
---
I hope not! I finally just got the damn thing! 
---
Besides the storys, the first two expansion offer these things:
---
CoO: Forge Weapons (not to be mistaken with the new ones from black armory), a raid lair (shorter raid), exotics
---
Warmind: Escalation Protocol Weapons (the shotgun is still pretty good), exotics, raid lair
---
I'm not sure about the old raids, from time to time you see people doing them. The do not reward high level gear (max 400). 
---
Nothing special to consider, gear in forsaken has random rolls - so don't dismantle every duplicate without checking.
---
True. We are consistent. We complain and still play. I complain, still play. Again joking. 
---
The entire match was a clusterfuck. We basically just gave up after a certain point. 
---
DestinyItemManager (DIM) is the best I have found.  On the Invetory page you can see all of your characters and vault stuff with out having to click between them, drag and drop to move items, and see your max light for each character.  On the progress page you can wee your valor, glory, and imfamy, milestones that need to be completed, and all quest/boutnies and your progress on each.  On the collections page you can see all of the catalyst you are working on, hovering over gives you the ##/### progress not the percentage, as well as all of your collection items.
---
bye
---
I picked colossus....mistakes were made lol. Mostly cause I was top stubborn to Google how to hover.
---
On ps4 didnt knoe it was right thumb stick. All I knew was fly and then aim allowed me to hover. So didnt want to take storm who is all about hovering while I didnt know how. Granted did want to try colossus, but storm just looks sooo damn fun. 
---
Two hours remain
---
He soloed Mara 
---
I agree
---
Was just about to warn the OP not to start Amory wars, and then I saw this comment haha
---
Ps4. Don't recall hardlight specifically. Couple of Lunas for sure. They just outclassed us on every level, which goes back to my claim that Bungie has bullshit matchmaking. Never should've even come up against someone that much better if matchmaking worked properly. 
---
option 1 comes with forsaken and the other 2 dlc and the second option comes with forsaken the other 2 dlc and the annual pass.
---
To be honest I would say try the base game first but it has a lot of good shit but forsaken is where it's at.
---
Honestly first time I beat the jumping puzzle with two deaths, and couldn't kill a single add in the first room. After that I took me like 7 tries to get through the jumping puzzle, even with Lion Rampart.
---
In the companion app go to the weapon in your gear tab and go into it's details. Scroll down and tap on the catalyst and it'll show you x/300. 
---
Damn I've just noticed this gun looks like a dong... It even have groins underneath...
---
If you're on xbox I've always wanted to do spite of stars but I myself and inexperienced 
---
Got mine off a curated Ringing Nail.
---
What sniper is that? How u get it? Looks dope
---
That’s why you don’t bank at 15 silly
---
Wasn't really a nerf, just a fix. Gwisin allowed for supers to last for like 2/3 minutes or something stupid like that because it wasn't working as intended. It still works to extend your Blades now but just not quite as much as before
---
Bro where does it say I'm upset? If anything I'm asking why people get upset when this is such a non-issue, stop reflecting on me, jesus.
---
is it only me or others hates shotguns entirely ? :) ...
---
You have the shootn’t
---
Thorn ain't coming in this patch 
---
Thank you! All these others againts me saying there is nothing wrong to it! Good guy OP atleast agrees and understands what im saying!
---
You mean Last Word, right? Thorn doesn’t comeback till next season
---
Also take into account that a single auto rifle shot is at the lower end of damage. 
---
Single shot weapons as well as heavy and special weapons tend to do more damage. 
---
Bring back my hawkmoon then we can talk. 
---
Yup.
---
I see all these complaints about telesto, I don’t see it in PvP a whole lot, always a good mix in my matches. 
---
But muh mobility mechanics
---
Yeah or sucks they didn’t tell you controls, L3 is sprint, L3 mid air is fly, R3 mid air is hover, Up on D-Pad is super, R1 is focus blast thing and L1 is grenade, L2 aim and R2 shoot, L1 + R1 is shield, Triangle is melee, Square is reload, Hold square is swap weapons, X is obviously jump, Down on d-pad was emote, left and right on d-pad was cycle through emotes, I don’t remember what circle was
---
Where is that?
---
Man your own jackhammer. We'll have OP home pretty soon.
---
Just have fun with it. Before the meta, the shotgun was the only weapon type I didn't use. But, when they became the thing to use, not only did I pick up a new weapon type, but I let myself see it as fun. If you're getting outplayed by them, watch those people and how they are killing you. So that in the future, you can outplay them in return. I love the fast paced feeling of risking it all just to get up close. And if it's done correctly, you are rewarded. 
---
For me playing the Anthem beta a big problem was the lack of character. 
---
When playing Destiny I enjoy fighting Cabal or Fallen because I know their backstory. I know why they are doing what they are doing and I know the story of Calus and the Red Legion for instance and it gives it implicit character.
---
Same thing for the worlds. Worlds which I enjoy being in because I know about them regardless of where that story was told. Now I want to be fair to Anthem and say that I imagine some of this will come in the main release when we can experience the whole story but for me the enemies I was fighting, the story I was experiencing  and the world I was exploring lacked an element of character. 
---
Now, to Anthem's credit this is probably because it hasn't had 2 games, 3 Major Expansions and 4/5 smaller expansions with plenty of supplemental content.
---
Either way I truly hope people enjoy Anthem. I'm just probably not going to pick it up for some of the reasons I have explained. What I do dislike which I have seen often in this sub and /r/DTG is this almost tribal like attitude of Destiny being called trash compared to Anthem and more importantly why I'm stupid for not being interested and would rather stick with Destiny. That is all. 
---
"Perfectly balanced... As all things should be."
---
\-Ghandi
---
According to hunters bungie hates them and they’ve always been underpowered. Yet they’re the most picked class by tryhards. It’s hilarious 
---
Yes people still raid. Not so much for Leviathan, SoS, or EoW.
---
Save your enhancement cores and avoid infusing until you are max power (650)
---
Oh get anthem the next greatest game from EA that already won 90+ awards before release it is most definitely not just a marketing tactic and this game is not filled to the brim in micro transactions. Oh did I mention this is also the most action packed game of 2019. This whole post is sarcastic because anthem sucks and is another cash grab that will fail
---
"Hur dur, this game is copying Warframe, the javelin is the warframe and the *spoiler* mode is the freelancer"
---
Weird al showed up!
---
What do you mean you could get caught by like 3 shards across the map and expect death 
---
You have to many eyes... Looks amazing tho
---
Now there are 2 of them!
---
To be fair I started playing warframe this weekend and I did see the similarities but idk, I'm a sucker for a pretty game. Also warframe grind is rediculous
---
Comprehensible
---
it's the Gambit sniper, can't remember the name
---
Something about a helmet not moving
---
Keep a bar on top of the barrels. When you want to fire, you tilt the gun back so the bar ends up on both hammers and holds them down.
---
Ty :D
---
I prefer a good handcannon like ace of spades, better devils, or trust. Pair that with a decent shotgun and you're gold. 
---
The only time that should happen is in a lane or the equinox map, otherwise you should be able to murder the telesto easily, shotguns make up like 85% of special gun kills for a good reason, most maps aren't viable for it 
---
Welp, now I gotta reinstall Skyrim...
---
tham thas a lot of exotics uncovered .. :)
---
My computer always seems to disable the blue light filter wvery time i start destiny. Dunno how to stop it lol
---
😂😂😂That's definitely a little kid or someone whose first language isn't English.
---
Yeah, this is like a weird brand loyalty. Competition makes producers and devs try harder y'all. It's healthy. 
---
&gt; Expect to see a lot of people treating Anthem as some savior of gaming over the next few months.
---
I'm actually willing to bet that after people play it and it lacks an endgame most people will be back to Destiny.
---
A problem EA have always had is delivering on Post-Release content IMO. Lack of updates and content for almost a year killed BF1 more than any microtransaction controversy.
---
Yea there are some common points such as scifi, actions, third-person-looter-shooter... But there is no need to say this game is more superior than the others or this gaming is trying to be the others, and then spread hate toward those games and their players. 
---
I’m not a huge shotgun guy, so I never got Zenith :/
---
I don't really care, but it is apples to oranges. Telesto could onko from pulse rifle range, with no damage falloff. Shotguns are just close range high risk weapons.
---
Again I really don't care that much about whatever meta is there, whether it is shorty, pulse or whatever the meta is. I was fine with telesto. 
---
Here is a question for you: if shotguns are in such need of a Nerf, or you think they should've gotten needed as well, how would you do it? What changes would you make to a shotgun?
---
I know, I was "Joking" too.
---
Why would you nerf titan oem parts? It's not like it's all aftermarket... my titan has a twin turbo lion rampants that pushes about 33% more pounds of boost through the jump jets
---
Spider is unlocked after you do the first mission for Forsaken, so that should be next after you finish the Warmind campaing.  Until he is unlocked I would suggest doing daily bounties from the planet vendors to spend some glimmer.  They are usually quick and give you 10 planet materials each.  They are a great way to farm materials.  If you max out on glimmer it really isn't a big deal.  Glimmer is easy to come by so don't worry about it to much.  
---
Once you have spider you should always look to see if he has shards or mercury seeds for glimmer.  Shards are used for everything including buying Y1 exotics from Xur on the weekends (need just under 200 to buy one of each from him).  You want to have a good supply of them.  You can get them from Spider, breaking down legendary &amp; exotic gear you don't need/want, and breaking down legendary shaders gotten anywhere but from Tess.
---
Heroic Public events will help you get the xp need to fill up the 2nd subclass up quickly.  You may want to go to Earth and hop from event to event.  There are usually always people there doing events.  
---
Make sure you are using either a fireteam medallion (from Tess) or an XP ghost.  (If you have found it the Neon Helix has XP for any activity plus a combo detector for a specific planet.  You can repurchase with bright dust from collections to get one for each planet if you want.)  This will help you get to 50 quickly.
---
If you have Mars unlocked you should google the memory fragments and go ahead and get them.  There are 45 total (you get the Worldline Zero exotic sword at 35.)  With a good video you can get all 45 of them in about 20-30 minutes.  
---
You should also save all the resonate stems you get.  You will need them for the Sleeper quest (you have to  make 16 codes to open sleeper nodes, so you need a minimum of 64 resonate stems).  There is also a special emblem for opening all 40 nodes.  The nodes are also where you get Braytech Schematics from.  You turn these into Ana for special Braytech weapons (the only one that does not come from schematics is the Osprey rocket launcher, it comes from Stranger Terrain Nightfall).  You need all of the Braytech wapons to get your Wayfarer title.
---
Competition is healthy dude. Calm down. 
---
Spectral blades. Thats it.
---
“Fox, do a barrel roll!”
---
&gt; The gunplay doesnt feel satisfying
---
This is kinda the point though. There are similarities sure between the two games but core gameplay is quite different. One is foccused on Cooldowns and Abilites and the other Gunplay.
---
Core gameplay loop is much different, I'm not sure you can really compare them.
---
Whatever you say guy on the internet
---
There are also other skulls in the dreaming city that are basically vendors, if I recall. 
---
Did this with sentinel shield other day most satisfying thing ever
---
Yep! Totes agree. More than likely I'll be on destiny way more every expansion drop but I've been yearning for a new looter shooter game. Maybe anthem will shake things up
---
umm.... or just go to the Core Terminus lost sector twice for 10 stems per boss kill. rush through, kill the boss, pick up, rinse and repeat.
---
You're getting downvoted, but I felt the same way since their first trailer. Felt like a destiny clone. 
---
I wish you luck, it is so worth it
---
Why should they have called a demo a beta if it wasn't one, just bc most developers call their demo's a beta? 
---
https://i.imgur.com/9oCIb7k.jpg
---
&gt; I made the mistake of buying fallout 76
---
This is why I will never buy a game before it has been out for at least 30 days and I see some reviews/gameplay video of it.
---
I dont mind anthem, I might get it if it does well on launch (never pre ording something again after no mans sky) but ads are annoying, especially ones you see over and over
---
When I complain its not about the gun, or the skill. You clearly have more skill than me, and the gun is a memento of that, and one that exacerbates the problem. My complaint is that I am facing 4 of you, when Im clearly inferior in every way, and still the leader of my team.
---
8.5 kd in PvP as well
---
you only killed 5. not team wipe
---
“Destiny isn’t a horror game”
---
Thanks a bunch for the help, appreciate it.
---
Right now I just do whatever daily's I can do for powerful gear, and hang out at the Blind well and doing Tier 3 Heroic events when theres a handful of us.  I've gotten a few exotics as drops but the Legendary gear grind is going so slloooww..
---
Seems like level 1 -&gt; 50 went quick.  Light level 1 -&gt; 500 went quick, but 500-&gt;600 is taking me forever and a half.
---
Nope. And all your supers are getting buffed. Only Warlocks and Hunters are getting nerfed today. Because giving Hunters suicide supers is necessary.
---
r/jojokes
---
I got by drop this, with these rolls and this is the shotty for PVP. 
---
And i dont play much PVP or use shottys.
---
Looking to get The Chaperone...
---
Am I the only person that wants the Monte Carlo or the Zhalo Supercell back?
---
Upload to youtube from Xbox or psn or copy to usb 
---
The copy to usb may only work on android 
---
For real though, if the starting screen actually hurts you, the room you're playing in is not bright enough and you are seriously fucking your eyesight. 
---
Interestingly enough, the best use I've found for it so far is Gambit, procced TTK is absurd
---
I've made a personal promise to myself to never trust EA again. So even if it looks cool I'd rather not give money to a company that has routinely screwed me.
---
Hell, try making a post in r/warframe that criticizes the lore in any way and see what happens?  I got some really fucking hate filled PMs (you know, since they want to preserve that public image and all).
---
I used to love Warframe, but then it stopped being Warframe and become operatorframe and I pretty much stopped playing.  And the "lore" is like something a couple of drunk highschoolers came up with "dude, you know what else would be cool?" stitched together with duct tape and hand waiving.
---
I've had this idea of Sublasses to DnD-Classes floating around my head for a while now and made a few neat sketches today in school.
---
Maybe I'll do a more detailed digital version of this, haha, just kidding, I would need another 10 hours in my day to finish all my ideas.
---
Here's the basic idea.
---
Adventurers of Void: Warlock, Paladin, Ranger
---
Adventurers of Arc: Druid, Monk, Sorcerer
---
Adventurers of Solar: Gunslinger, Cleric, Barbarian
---
I think these turned out pretty neat and trying to imitate the D2 armour aesthetic is very interesting.
---
Not really that crazy, you got tokens from every single activity and if you really wanted the sunshot catalyst but had no time, you could pledge for the same faction all 3 weeks. 
---
 No matter where you aim it is always a headshot in gambit or PVP
---
There's like 5 people who care about this and devs have bigger things on their plate. It'll never get replaced.
---
WOW YOU MEAN I CAN RECLAIM GUNS I ALREADY HAD AGAIN?!?
---
I CANT WAIT TO GRIND FOR IT AGAIN!
---
/s
---
This is a rip off to me.
---
The fact that these guns didn't carry over is already fucking bullshit. AND NOW they are using it like advertisement to fill the fact that this past dlc drop has been stale and hasn't had many weapons.
---
Lmfao get played. 
---
W0w I can use THORN or LW again!
---
Lmao man how low does my life have to be to be excited to use a pistol I used in the last game for 3 plus years.
---
Yall get too excited for getting played by Bungie.
---
"I got an idea, let's add guns from the last game that they already had that we took away!"
---
Lmfao
---
On to other games.
---
God damnit Ricky. Get out of my car!
---
Its countered by letting them run with impunity. Makes sense. 
---
  
---
Defend it however you want, i got OEM on my titan, and played around in Crucible my KDA went up by 2. 2!!!! this is in a 25 game sample size.
---
2.3 KDA to 4.3 KDA. Its a game changer. more than my Gwisen Vest hunter, or my Void Nova lock. What is disgusting about OEM is that abusing shitty guns makes it that much better.
---
OEM is broken, stop defending it. 
---
Needs another row
---
If it works the same in D2 compared to D1 in terms of fire rate (full-auto making it reach higher rates of fire) and actually 3-taps (no extra buffs needed) like it does in the trailer.. it has a lower TTK, yes.
---
Negative point is that it's probably 3 head, instead of 2 head 1 body. On top of the lower range.
---
Soooooo, still a legit farming strat then?
---
I mean you do it to get legendaries without useless perks. RNG is RNG. 
---
Smart Tip your able to jump straight to the Boss with stompis if u start from the first rock and jump to the pillow gap rejump from there to the Boss. 
---
The jump is not easy tho and may only possible in pc since u have more frames to time the rejump
---
Umm they do have sets of armor
---
Damn, is spectral blades duration getting nerfed? That’s the only super that really needs tweaking imo 
---
Agree with you, although, in pve ursa, ursa never leaves the spot! Sometimes in pvp with the middle defender tree is kinda fun tanking and being able to cast 2 seconds after a new super 
---
I dunno riven looking hella thicc
---
Might start working on it next season. Only have 2 resets so far this season and so I won't get close. 
---
Anthem actually seems kinda fun
---
Poor bastard
---
It should be included,  we paid for something 
---
Yeah Fortnite is so over rated and over hyped. I’m not gonna be a dumb childish hater and lie though. The game is s good game. If it wasn’t then it wouldn’t be what it is today. But just because it’s good doesn’t mean everyone has to like it. I personally don’t. The only reason I rag on it at all is because it has become such a fad and it’s literally everywhere.
---
I was in my weekly NA meeting last Thursday morning and something about weird dances came up, so I quickly jumped up and I started trying to do that dance where you hop on one foot and kick your other foot out and in and out and in while shaking your fist up and down right by your head. Immediately my counselor started laughing and pointed at me. I said “what?! Do you know what that is??” And she replied “of course I do, it’s Fortnite”. Idk, it’s just a bit much for me. It gets worshipped.
---
People wanted it to be game of the year because it was popular. No. Game of the year goes to the game that had 10/10 ratings in all departments that get critiqued. Music, graphics, gameplay and features. Not to a game just because it was the most popular for the duration of a year. You know what I mean? It’s just one of those smh slash rolling my eyes kind of things for me lol. Idk. But yeah, def. fuck Fortnite.
---
Anthem however looks cool though to me. I’m excited to check that shit out some more.
---
Although it's generally true that Breakneck and Ikelos SG make for a good primary/special combo. It's really only the heavy that you would need to change
---
Neither do i, is that arabic or something?
---
Ophidia spathe, throw daggers really removed all need for a primary. I can just run around sniping whatever I want and rarely swap.
---
They said it was
---
Is Celestial Nighthawk is still worth it with the changes? Been playing with it a lot recently.
---
oh...ill just delete my post , i wasn’t aware of it
---
Very helpful guide for the week 
---
It will still do more damage, a lot more now, however its interaction with 6-shooter could make it one of the best items in the game
---
lolllll
---
Are those nightfalls correct?
---
No strange terrain again? It repeats the same strikes over and over again, we literally just had will of the thousands and a garden world. BUNGIE, COME ON  
---
I am waiting for 4 weeks to get that Wayfarer title and I am sick of it
---
I just need one of them rare bounties from Ada...losing my damn mind. Haven’t got one in 3-4 weeks.
---
Yes, especially if you are playing missions with a big boss at the end 
---
That doesn't sound right, but I don't know enough about thermonuclear weapons to dispute it.
---
Last word today
---
It's 'maintenance'
---
Tempted to grind this.. I do love pulse rifles.
---
But with a God roll blast furnace already I'm just not sure there's a point. 
---
Bruh same. 
---
Yeah one weapon and helmet but I've out leveled the helmet now. Ok cook thanks man. I've all dlc except for annual pass. I have forsaken though
---
Better than breakneck? 
---
When Reddit users think crying about OEM is quality content
---
Gonna Miss the other one. It fit my Arc Titan really well. 
---
#DIO
---
Have played, and been disappointed, had I have pre-ordered, rather than bought a month of Premier Access for $20, I would have cancelled my pre-order...
---
It’s certainly not bad, and there’s a bit of fun to be had, the potential of the game is huge, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired.... the issues far outweigh the fun so far... I mean KB&amp;M was near unplayable for me, so much input lag and mouse acceleration left a Lot to be desired, and that was just the first thing to put a dampener on things.... 
---
I’ll be playing at launch, after all I have a month of access, but my hopes aren’t high right now, I’m giving it the benefit of the doubt, but I have a feeling it will be something like No Mans Sky, where it will be well worth revisiting in the future, after a LOT more work has gone into it....
---
Mee vittuu saatanan ryssä
---
Jesus Christ, I’m glad I’m not the only one this happened to
---
Not exactly. Like I said there's a video on how to do it but I'm not sharing it
---
If Mayhem doesn’t count I don’t even want to bother.
---
Yes that worker thank you 
---
Not possible 
---
I understand.  With us being very active in our clan, and always on with other players, we decided that separate was better.  If it was't for that I would have mine set up in front of the fireplace in the livingroom where we would be pretty close and could just chat through the archway.
---
Yikes. Not surprised. Us Warlocks are just going to stay in our trash cans then. 
---
Why did every dlc have to update uuuuggghhh
---
Username checks out 
---
Nova bomb actually got a nice buff from what I've seen in pve so far.
---
I have to update the game. 83gb. This is fucking stupid
---
*twirls mustache*
---
I mean, that's cool for PVE I guess. 
---
I can say the same about Skullfort though. 
---
Literally ”out of hand”
---
I mostly dont do pvp and if I do it's on my titan
---
i watched my friend play d1 sometimes and he talked about xur, so when i got d2 i figured he was in the game and searched up an app to track him. 
---
This quest step is PURE cancer
---
I worked on it for awhile, and yea I'm mediocre at pvp and hate crucible, but after 6 matches and seeing your % sit at 8-10% and no higher, that makes it not worth my time.
---
Freakin flat earth, gets you every time!! 
---
Wait, what's the point of running 6 shooter with celestial nighthawk? Aren't you getting one shot anyway?
---
Escalation protocol 100%
---
Yeah this nerf is absolute bullshit. OEM is untouched though ofc 
---
I’ve seen 50 without dying. 2% a kill, -1% a death. 
---
They said they fixed that bug in the patch notes. Did they not actually fix it?
---
Im ready to see aome panicked hunter kill themselves with it! Tired of this super
---
*gets 9 riskrunners in a row*
---
well this is a shame because I've played 4 matches and I'm at 8%
---
I got you fam. It's like a Large phone.
---
Thanks , I added all those who sent me a PM. Great community here ;)
---
PS : As a Warlock best way I found was to use Dawnblade + Icarus Dash.  Allows skipping of some annoying parts .   
---
I’d say most hair pulling part of it is actually waiting for the event + unique kill + portal in between each attempt.   I’d have practice runs at the heroic version if I could !!!!
---
nah it just doesn't fit the art style of destiny.
---
It’s not good anyway. Don’t worrie too much about it.
---
Yeah all my friend i used to play destiny with gave up on the game so I just have to resort to randos
---
Except that, in my opinion, it's easier and quicker to take a pic straight from the reddit app and post it. 
---
The gun is from D1, people paid if you divide the seasons pass price for each dlc, 10bucks and the only thing you got is a raid (which is okayish) and checking checkboxes.
---
The last real content drop was 3 to 4 months ago. So yeah I think we deserve better.
---
Last week's Will of the Thousands was only the second Will since Forsaken. 
---
Corrupted has only come up 3 times since Forsaken, once since BA.
---
Nightfalls and Weekly Wanted enemies are so rigged. I still haven't gotten Blood Cleaver since it only came up friggin ONCE.
---
Just play mayhem it’s supers galore. Makes the step a lot more bearable and quicker
---
For sure. I completed the Dredgen title and jut need Osprey for Wayfarer so I was thinking I’d like to work on Cursebreaker but damn the rng is rough. 
---
Eh a lot of people will be getting home from work that will make it just as sweaty... 
---
The trick to killing invaders, drop whatever you are doing, immediately equip thunderlord, and start fucking hunting
---
if you hide, you're giving advantage to the invader, because you'll get cornered and murdered. If you're instantly on the hunt for the invader, you have the chance to catch them off guard. 
---
if you don't have thunderlord, find another heavy weapon to use. but thunderlord wrecks invaders for me
---
Wait mayhem is back! 
---
Wow it is actually 225 rpm that’s insane
---
Looks like im going to mars
---
Apparently it’s randomly generated. I’d like to know how friggin’ hard it would be to put one person, a damn intern even on it to decide on a curated NF list each week. It really can’t be that much work, right? 
---
This week and next week all weapons can drop. The week after next is just the shotgun that drops.
---
&gt; Change can't happen without discussion
---
You act you're some kind of activist for a noble cause.  Who gives a shit abut the white splash screen. There are things really worth changing, and then there are things that players nag about like this is a restaurant and bungie got your order wrong. Stop being a baby about it and learn to deal.
---
I know exactly who I'm talking to, a Reddit nobody with a two week old account and 0 karma who apparently thinks he's hot shit
---
Do you not read the Reddit posts? Lol
---
Name of that? 
---
how? you lose progress when you die
---
I've since read that it's actually a little more forgiving than I originally thought--it's more like you have to get a .5 kda to progress, which is totally reasonable. Also chill on the condescending, it makes you look like an asshole. 
---
You can do it Santa!!!
---
This is what I get for playing Titan and refusing to use OEM for the sake of my honor
---
Give me your furnace if you do get this! :p
---
I didn’t even check yet today I just jumped on and started playing this is awesome I might actually get this step done before destiny 3 comes out
---
Thanks for trying to help, but I know what it is.
---
Seeing as you seem like the type who likes to be well informed, why don't you be a good chap and check out the wikipedia page on the word "Negro". Interestingly, the word gained popularity in the 60's as a racist term. Before then it was a genuine abbreviation for the word "negroid" which is, as I'm sure you'll know, just a term to describe someone of a particular ethic origin.
---
Even if you want to argue that, contextually, the word is not offensive, this is not a NSFW sub. And this post got reported for being vulgar. My hands are tied.
---
Furthermore, I've had to take this meme down already. I can't let one poster post and not another.
---
So, yeah, there is something wrong with him saying that. If it were up to me personally, I'd allow it.
---
Anyway, thanks for the feedback :)
---
Thanks mate ! Some groups don’t allowed to share pics but thanks for your comment ! And I will add my signature for the future aha
---
This game is broken with so much locked behind a dice roll. Change my mind.
---
Thanks dude.
---
Did someone try to do the pvp quest in custom games ?
---
To be fair, Shaxx has really just been getting Guardians to kill other Guardians for sport. Can't get good at stopping the cabal, if you don't practice stopping the Cabal.
---
Thanks for the comment. I will try the imgur thanks for the advise !
---
Oh? You’re approaching me? Instead of running away, you’re coming right to me?
---
I've seen everyone complaining about it lmao
---
Why is that?
---
I said it before and I will it again! Buff everything so we can have mayhem everywhere!
---
Oh my god..... You are fucking dramatic..... The white screen is the BANE of your EXISTENCE. What's your white blood slcell count when the screen shows up? Blood pressure? Please shut the fuck up. You fucking baby.
---
I run bow and smg.  I’m not sure if I’m significantly better than I thought I was or what, but I can get a kd of 2.0 in every other game some days.
---
The yeehaw returns is full yeehaww form.
---
Never post something anti-pvp on reddit, crucible fan boys will luna/nf/shotgun you with downvotes
---
Is this part of the new sandbox update?
---
Thanks for the reply!  Hovering over the symbols gives me no info, hence the question.  But yeah, they seemed to have upped the grind level quite a bit since I last played...
---
I’m Almost there I just need 1 reset
---
I know. I was just being a smartass about.
---
There's flinch in war thunder?
---
Aha I know lots of my colleagues are playing destiny. If you want the pics no problem for use !
---
I have yet to yee my haw. Cant wait.
---
Yes sir. 
---
You lose like 2% when you die and you gain like 4% per kill. Add supers into the mix and you’ll get it done in a blaze 
---
I'll keep my eye out for it. I might already have it and just forgot. I have Queenbreaker but my aim is either 100% pro and I'm the best thing since sliced bread, or I can't hit that large cabal standing still to save my life.
---
Some people don't play Destiny for the PvP. Gambit is a good compromise but forcing people to play PvP for a bunch of different things really sucks.
---
Especially with a penalty on death. It just allows people used to the PvP to stomp the people just trying to get some quest done who don't even want to be there.
---
It does count 
---
I found escalation protocol helped me fly through the whole first questline for last word
---
6 games of mayhem in, already regretting my life choices.
---
Thats a repost bud
---
Wow blatant and terrible repost 
---
That’s what I thought. Thanks. 
---
It does work, but only the explosions will kill you and they aren't that big, so they have to be point blank.
---
That's actually why I quit destiny.
---
That’s what I figured but thought they changed it. I got a boar error after updating is all probably
---
Yeah guess, must be an assload of salt for getting downvoted for asking a question.
---
I apologize to all the bad kids.
---
Left, no right! 
---
Could it, by any chance, be that, maybe, just maybe, the game is a PvE game with PvP at the side?
---
You need to get all 9 cats on all 3 characters for them to stop dropping
---
Guess you missed out on the barrages. It's pretty standard you know. To use your super
---
I’d love to help, tho I’m not entirely sure what to do. But I’m decent at the game. 
---
Nah thats not ban worthy, and I wasn't baiting him. I made a comment on his post as a user, when he used vulgarities i.e breaking Rule 8. I stepped out as a moderator to tell him it's not permitted.
---
Idk why shitty players feel entitled to tlw.  If you suck, sorry, its gonna be harder. You might suck too bad to get the weapon.  Not like you’d put it to good use anyway if you suck at the game.
---
YESSSS FINALLY ALSO FUCK YOU ITS STILL OP
---
There is also:
---
Bungie.net (this is the same as the companion app one)
---
Destinylfg.com
---
The100.io
---
R/fireteams
---
R/destinysherpa
---
These are all LFG resources for finding people in the game. 
---
Please. 
---
Just got a jvc 4K tv last week and I can’t believe how dark destiny is now...I can hardly see in some places.hopefully they address it at some point but I’ll try the SD brightness slider thing see if that works 
---
I mean thats the defeatist attitude everyone has towards all hand cannons outside of 180s on console anyway so... this fucking community apparently forgot qe used these damn guns for almost 4 years without fault but now no one can use them its kinda sad.
---
I just didn't read any of that. But thanks for playing. Buh bye
---
The memes I have in mind are inside jokes with some friends so they may not be funny, sorry 
---
The crucible part was definately easier than expected (reading this reddit) even though I am a crucible casual. Did it in +/-5 games in rumble. Crucible is such a frustrating experience at it's core that I sympathize with the non-crucible players here. All kinds of Crucible quests are bad.
---
Riven isn't an exploit though its just effective buff stacking and DPS - fully permitted without means of exploitation.
---
Steps to success:
---
1) Don't keep track of progress. It stresses you out.
---
2) If you can, play for fun.
---
3) Push hard when it gets sweaty.
---
4) Only play when you're in the zone. Come back to it if you are not in the zone. It's so easy to tumble back and get consequently stressed.
---
Hope that helps, this is what got me through similar D1 quests. 
---
Well if Hunter's are forced to exploit their exotics, why do you think that is?
---
Ah got it, thanks 
---
Understandable have a great day
---
That makes it to easy, the gun needs to have a painful quest so it makes getting the gun even better. Like working outdoors in the heat then getting a cold drink afterwards to give you a QUENCH. 
---
You're not forced to exploit anything, the point is their exotics weren't working as intended. They were OP and got seen to, just like Ursa Furiosa.
---
The encounter was, however, not designed to be completed this way. They could've given her a little more health in a patch. 
---
i thought that meant N words and explicitly dissing someone, ffs
---
Blaming others for your shortcomings is why you may or may not suck at crucible.  What weapons are you using?  
---
They can't afford to craft a single-player story on par with Halo, so this is what we get. I have resigned myself to it. I enjoy it despite it limitations.
---
Time to mix it up! Dawnblade got a buff, and was good even before 
---
Yup
---
15 games? I'm on 9 now and it's still at 0%
---
What shader is that?
---
It is. I’ve been using it since the nova nerds were announced. Now it’s buffed it’s only gonna feel stronger 
---
The reason they did it is because so many people beat Riven already so it'd be unfair to change it. The SoTP exploit brings him to his DPS phase when he literally shouldn't be damageable. Riven can take damage in that moment without exploit - i understand your point but the SOTP thing is genuinely mechanic-bending. The Riven thing is just taking advantage of an open DPS window.
---
I love this one. What are those 2, where can I see it?
---
Yes you can. Go in with ppl, move as a group, teamshot your opponents. 
---
In destiny 1
---
For sure.
---
Obnoxious swearing in posts usually gets removed, vulgarity is vulgarity. You can do it man, people solo queued Lunas, commit brother!
---
Bioware hasn't been OG in a while.
---
What are you running?
---
Its a PvP weapon. I still don't have whisper for example but im not going to start a thread and cry about it. 
---
Yeah but it’s
---
- 2% for kill
---
- 1% for assist
---
- minus 1% for a death
---
So even if you’re a flat 1kd player it should be attainable.  It’s kinda nice to have weapons that not everyone can get.  Games need to stop making everyone feel like their a god.  It’s good to let reality hit people hard sometimes.
---
I know what you mean as well. I just feel like it didn't need to be patched. Being a person really interested in optimal speedruns and speedrun tactics, I think It's a rather surprising change to see in the patch notes.
---
that will never happen for me
---
it most likely isn’t in the loot pool so i would definitely keep it
---
Okay well thanks for the response. I appreciate it.
---
They would down the titan before seeing "marked for vengeance"
---
Or just run three lost sectors real quick
---
Np b :) 
---
Bruh all of your who say it's possible are big fat damn liars.
---
RISE MY ARMORED BROTHERS, THE DAY OF THE KNIFE AND PALM IS OVER! NO MORE SHALL WE TREMBLE BEFORE A SCRAWNY HUNTER. NO MORE SHALL WE WORRY ABOUT THAT WEAK WARLOCK IN THE DISTANCE. RISE MY BROTHERS, THE DAY OF THE FIST HAS COME!!!
---
Naw a Titan who uses this exotic it’s the only one that scared blade barrage users 
---
If you're hunter, spam Blade Barrage in mayhem. It's even easier if you have shards.
---
Titan, spam hammers. Top tree for the explosions. Stay in cover when your super isn't charged.
---
Warlock, spam bottom tree nova bombs, and use skull of a dire ahamkara if you have it.
---
Tadah.
---
Upvote this for being true!! 
---
Stop trying to use a sniper with enemies 10 feet away. You can't do it in any game or real life!! ITS A SNIPER FOR RANGE!
---
  PvP is utterly shite.
---
This is getting out of hand, now there are 2 of them!
---
and then TRIALS CAME AROUND LIKE "SUP BRAH"
---
many controllers were lost that day...
---
Except your super energy vanishes if you try to charge it up which you have to because they decreased the range on it
---
yess
---
Except for the fact that it's just gonna have people non-stop leaving crucible matches to find better teams. Would have been way better as a progression IMO. 
---
just need dedicated servers the peer to peer is poo.
---
Titans and warlocks dont because all their exotics are so trash there is nothing to exploit
---
Hey man, it's harder for some people than it is for others because of their skill in crucible and the other players they face. You probably aren't quite as good as the people you get matched against and that's why it's so difficult for you. 
---
orrr you could go play BO4, the guy is stating an opinion, next time give a less hostile answer
---
Ya it is fairly hard to get into. 
---
One thing is I’m pretty sure there is a way to get everything by just playing the game the micro transactions just let you skip grinding/ waiting
---
Turns out training a group of elite heavily armored warriors to hold a wall at all costs doesn't work out when the enemy flies over that wall. 
---
I'm trash in crucible lol I freely admit that.
---
Welcome to mayhem
---
Excellent pun but I'm still finding it painfully annoying even in Mayhem
---
Definitely, lots and lots of grinding
---
It's mayhem week. You can do it
---
Already did 😁, played destiny since D1 on day 1 and so many people have left because they only focus on PVP with the patches and updates while the bugs like rivens walk guitar error still causes issues with getting the flawless raid.  I’ve stayed loyal this whole time hoping bungie would get better but all this recycled content, exotics, &amp; gear is like buying a 2014 Audi at the same price as a 2019... paying full price for something old
---
...isn't his horn on the other side?
---
This has been the most rage inducing thing I have done in any game I can think of. As a strictly pve player bungie you can go fuck yourself
---
yeah, tried that. that's where I lost all my progress.
---
No, it’s *not* a flamethrower
---
If it makes you feel better, I'm at 87% after 2 games... 
---
Go mayhem :v
---
You just need kda more than one to progress I guess. 
---
30 mins i believe
---
RUMBLE played 3 qp matches and got \~10%, played 3 rumble matches and got it.
---
Random drop. 
---
I've noticed with guns like that one and ace, it looks like they fire from the bottom of the cylinder instead of the top.
---
Cheers mate!
---
I think it got added to the loot pool. Believe you can get it as a random drop.
---
Ahh, thanks
---
I think I'll just try to get a kill or two per may h at most.
---
Amen, brother. 
---
Because that would make too much sense.
---
