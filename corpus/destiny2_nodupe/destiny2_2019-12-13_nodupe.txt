Fun fact: if you jump off the platform with the shield looking thing you can make people yell
---
---
---
Damn that's hot
---
If by exactly the same you mean changed, sure.
---
You might as well keep grinding for the armour, there‚Äôs a bunch of Triumphs associated with forge-grinding and there are other special quests that could drop in the meantime. Also armour will drop occasionally when forging frames (both types) so your odds of completing a set are pretty good.
---
I just hope there‚Äôs more Egyptian themed armor. It‚Äôd be sick to have Anhur(lion), Sobek(crocodile), and Khepri(beetle) themed gear
---
Honestly, I hate meta changes because I usually load in to Crucible to have fun with whatever gun I like (sometimes AoS, sometimes Riskrunner, sometimes Last Word, etc. I like to use whatever gun feels fun to use, regardless of whether its any good), and suddenly I can't do that because I'm spending several matches adapting to the new meta so I can still use those guns. I play Crucible for a fun time, not to beat the everloving shit out of the enemy. So I admit to being frustrated when I happily go into Crucible to derp around with one of my favorite weapons and just get steamrolled by Recluse or whatever.
---
... You can be whatever u feel like friend/fellow guardian. I prefer male characters.. Feel too much like a flanders in his ski suit (stupid sexy flanders)...
---
I understand the smart ass infographic your gf did for you.. I did the same kinda thing when my gf asked about baby yoda and i went into way too much detail about the back story for a normal person..
---
The upgrade includes the current season pass but no more. They stated that they removed the deluxe at the end of undying
---
I love the added animation time, it feels so much smoother ironically
---
Are you going for Komodo?
---
I much preferred the European Helvetica zone, myself.
---
U just brought back memories I never thought I‚Äôd have again
---
it may be because of nvidia's new driver. can't say for sure though
---
Do you live in the USA?

Not gonna upvote this because you can overcome an addiction.

Your character looks hideous

Cute haha

Bastet, Thoth would be cool as well

Yep

I have to admit I suck with controllers üòÇ cuz atm I play on free time with console as I'm not at home for some times because of my job
---

---
BUT even If I suck with controllers, without being a god I'm still good at fps overall. Especially on pc where I reached global on cs:go on 2 account and did some lans on source and 1.6 back in the days, I'm playing Halo since the first one and I spent most of my chillhood on games like quake or starcraft. 
---
So even if I don't considere myself good on controllers because tbh I'm kind of a "pc main" and I maybe got the 1/10 of my skills with controllers compared to playing with a mouse, I still have enough knowledge and habits from other fps I grinded on pc to not be as bad as you think and thats why I made this post. 
---
Everyone here is taking this seriously and personnal but I'm just giving my opinion and my feelings, you all can disagree but don't judge, it's too much american-stereotypical (idk how to say that word lol) to judge others opinions
---
and tbh if even me can solo win streak at 5500 on controllers I think most of the players can do it with some tryhard sessions, thats not a pride ; even more if you play duoQ or trioQ.
---
 When you compare the skillgap of destiny top tier players with other fps more "raw" without that rpg / abilities aspect thats not the same level. On destiny only few players are above the "top tier" and can be considered godtier or pro player, compare it to cs where millions of ppl are playing and tryharding the game : the "god tier" players are much more (logical btw) so obviously the skillgap is higher AND it's harder to step up. Destiny pvp is half casual / half esport-like that what is frustrating, biggest example is that bungie wants players to tryhard with op exotics made for casu... wheres the point  ? I dont get it
---
Yessir, or somebody‚Äôs trying to get a couple days off to play Destiny 2 themselves, maybe? ;) 
---
Keep up the great work!
---
Ooooo I didn‚Äôt think of Bastet, scratch Khepris
---
Really appreciate the effort you went to in order to explain the system. I‚Äôm having some trouble following your outline, but I think I got the basics.  Thanks.
---
Voidshigi.
---
Thank you. It was a nice surprise when I took over last March; knowing I‚Äôd have someone to talk to about Destiny. Both of us are huge fans of the game.  And yes, he‚Äôs definitely earned a few extra ‚Äúsick‚Äù days.

I've already been collecting a bunch of other vanilla H√§kke weapons, they shoot well and look good once you get some H√§kke History shader on there. I like to use them together, a SoF would definitely compliment my Antiope, Halfdan or Zenobia.
---
and yeah hunter gang forever, I'm salty but after few days tryharding titan I came back to hunter. Even If I rage it still fits more my playstyle
---
I think I'm gonna get a try to warlock next week
---
I think I'll be needing that
---
Anyone having this problem? Since the Season of Dawn dropped, my Window Mode in my Video Settings keep getting reset to Fullscreen. I usually play in Windowed Fullscreen and it sucks having to set it back everytime I start the game.
---
You decided to purchase it with silver.
---
Nailed it
---
Ight guess I‚Äôm wasting 10 bucks
---
I was thinking Pokemon battle music. Those look like pikachu, kinda.
---
Sure, might be thicc but I'm not a fan of wearing a diaper. My bowels control themselves just fine, thanks.
---
Sweet Business right now. I love meme-ing with it in PvP.
---
It has been 2 days, dude. Play the quests and give it time.
---
Yeah. I honestly hope we get to choose whether to be a dick to him if we run into him again rather than being railroaded into it. Hopefully we can be chill to him. 
---
We already killed him once, in my personal opinion that makes us even.
---
Nice.
---
Your Hunter looks like the hobgoblin
---
I knew you didn‚Äôt want actual debate, who has time to type out paragraphs when it could be done so much easier over discord. Kids like you really don‚Äôt like doing that, so if you‚Äôre afraid I‚Äôll give you a break
---
Awesome! Great it's working for you now :)
---
Reading is fundamental.
---
*G O O D.*
---
No, I‚Äôd rather they didn‚Äôt add quests in Crucible that force ppl to spam one weapon or another.
---
You can't wear 2 exotics at the same time. This combo is a non issue.
---
Well shit I‚Äôve still only done it once lol
---
Why can't you carry on our conversation right here? Is it because your friends/like minded individuals are not here? Feel free to invite them to this conversation, I'll wait.
---
This pretty much fucking nailed it, also shes a keeper
---
Agreed but fun fact most of the playerbase joined at the FTP 750 light point, so most people dont have it. They stopped the game from dying by going ftp but now theres lots of old gear no one has and a majority playerbase that wants it. Now shhh and take your pinnacles.
---
Sorry for some errors while editing; I didn‚Äôt see them until just now. My apologies!
---
I love Mida in crucible, it‚Äôs what I used to get my recluse! I only used sunshot when D2 first came out.
---
Yes, you buy it using silver from the Eververse store. It's about $10 USD to get that much silver.
---
Lucky Pants got an indirect buff tbh, with bottom tree gunslinger at least. But yeah Lucky Pants needs something new to it
---
If you do the complete Storyline for that DLC, there is a mission when you go inside that room and build the perfect paradox.
---
Do you pair it with that Titan exotic that reloads autos?
---
Pikachu used Fly!
---
Mine doesnt
---
Nyooooooom
---
Thank you
---
‚¨ÜÔ∏èThis.........
---
Nope. I run The Hallowfire Heart with middle tree Sunbreaker. I have used that in the past before though, very good build.
---
What pulse rifle is that?
---
lollul*
---
I use several, but are you referring to the one with the simple red dot open sight that procs Kill Clip?
---
Its probably a lost sector with a nightmare boss. They spawn the weaker nightmares and they count as bosses for the quest.
---
See a need, fill a need.
---
You can. I think there's an option once you rank a sundial up enough, but I'm not sure. There's definitely an option through the season pass itself though, that allows you to increase the amount of linked sundials by 2 I think.
---
Its at the table to the left of Eris on the moon.
---
Free as in not through the season pass? Can't you only access the activity with it?
---
This is so cute and absolutely 100% accurate. Why does the pyramid thing have a tree on it though?
---
That guy really got to you didnt he?
---
Body shots counted for precision damage with Master of Arms up. No other gun in the game - exotics included - did that.
---
Nah, but I will not be labeled a dirty Jotunn-spammer
---
lulz
---
By what. The pve community? Lmao. Dont trip off em dude. If people complain about toxic weapons in control theyre prob bad
---
There isn't a high level drop like that ATM, sadly. You can, however, level up relatively quickly by going for the challenges that are available through most activities. If you have shadowkeep, and go through the campaign, you can do certain missions and get high rank gear. Vanguard has two avenues to get this, as does crucible. Mostly do what you want, but if you do crucible then most matches drop gear, and you get fairly powerful gear every time you raise your valor rank. So I'd recommend that, but only if you like pvp.
---
Wrong. 
---
Previously Master of Arms gave a 20% buff to headshot damage and a 90% buff to body shot damage. This made body shots do the exact same damage that you would have had you shot them in the head. Now it no longer does that and gives the same percentage to both body and head - all you have to do is aim at the head now.
---
It's a "bug"
---
Here's a giant miner truck to get all that salt away from you.
---
I get where your coming from. I am a band nerd I think flight of the bumblebee would be better if most people knew it

Aaaannnd i cant replay the video :/
---
Are you interrupting them? They don‚Äôt like to be interrupted.
---
Definitely Bigweld.
---
Not sure if bug or intentional, but I got all the way to the last step for Leviathan's Breath, and it says "Season 8 required"...
---
I didn't own the pass during season 8, but if they're going to give me a quest, they should let me finish it. Kinda bullshit.
---
F
---
Agrees. I can name 3 better communities and developers.
---
Lol
---
Most of them.
---
I do believe so. I've run it quite a bit, it's not as sharp as it once was. Before, it could turn on a dime. Now, it has to make a little arc.
---
Wish Ender has a glitch right now where the overpenatrating perk is applying multiple times.  That‚Äôs why it appears like it‚Äôs OP at times
---
I‚Äôm so glad it‚Äôs still as amazing :)
---
I never get these rolls. Just outlaw, kill clip, and rampage.
---
wow bows can be more competitive now
---
You‚Äôll get it all done in a single Vex Incursion public event.  Every plate-explodiboi and shielded Minotaur is a major.  Plus I think Drifter had a Public Event IO bounty ‚Äî&gt; kill two birds get twice the XP!
---
You needed to own season of undying as it‚Äôs exclusive to that season.
---
Just go for world drops. It's in the loot pool now with random rolls.
---
Dunno why you're getting downvoted, even in the Osiris campaign he says this practically word for word
---
Must be a bug. Unless the weapon was only attainable in season 8 which I doubt.
---
That's weird. Hope it gets fixed soon.
---
Yeah but rahool has it as well and I was at 11K shards so I did it. Didn‚Äôt get one then dismantled most everything I own. And didn‚Äôt get it again... I have the worst luck. My buddy got it in 2 engrams.
---
Yeah I'm getting this too - every launch of destiny 2 my graphic settings reset. There are a few posts on the bungie forums, thankfully it's in the list of know issues they're working on.
---
Annoying hey.. but on the upside it's made me play with settings to see how amazing i can make the game look, lol.
---
Duke mk 42, I‚Äôm only using it because it has good light power, I need to replace it
---
Potato ship

Saint-14: Greatest Titan who ever lived

The guardian: Greater than Saint-14
---
Sounds like a paradox to me.
---
So my own personal theory when sundance died, caydes connection to the deep stone crypt was reconnected and when he died, the deep stone crypt grabbed the data from cayde and forcibly reset him to gain data on guardian exos.
---
Some background for those who are interested. The assignment was to create a cinematic themed trailer (solely through video editing) on an already established piece of media. A few people did video games. Others did stuff like the Office or Friends. But, I don't play much of any video games other than destiny. So I went with it and really took my time. Had a lot of fun and just wanted to share!
---
Think of it like this.
---
100 levels.
---
Season is like 3 months long.
---
Get a level a day and you're basically set!
---
Yeah its weird cuz i started the quest in season 9
---
It's not hideous to me. Actually finally something that isn't a coat.
---
*laughs in gunslinger bottom tree*
---
I started the quest in season 9 though so why would they keep it around still?
---
Ive found three just playing the game.
---
I‚Äôm gonna just lock myself on a planet until I get it
---
Im only using it to get the ritual weapon.  After that, I can finally play with the loadout I want to.
---
You need to do a different activity
---
It‚Äôs obviously gift of the nine. Nice try through.
---
You know what. This should have been in Rainbow is Magic
---
When they released the ftp version they changed how all the campaigns and shit work
---
No üòÇ I gave up after about 2 hours and dying like 5 times because of fallen crossfire.
---
If not mistaken players used to use the sticky grenades for mountaintop as platforms to get to free raid chest in garden of salavation but now they disable that feature    `\(  " /)  /`
---
falling with style.
---
Yeah it is I just had a brain fart and screwed the whole thing up xD
---
When I played titan it felt like an underwhelming exotic. I don‚Äôt think they would add reviving back to destiny but maybe it could give you an overshield and a recovery buff for a bit? Just something to keep you alive better.
---
sparrow for racing I cry blood tears
---
It‚Äôs a spoiler
---
Thanks, do you recommend I buy anything with the 800 Bright Dust I started with? I don't see the point of a shader since I will be switching out armor so often as I level up.
---
It's the orb melee. I'm using it to skate on warlock but it targeted the nearest mob and so I skated off the edge.
---
It's a sequential unlock.  You won't see the quest where he "arrives" (which hasn't dropped yet anyway) until after you finish the quest where you meet him the first time and give him the gun.
---
That would work for me. 
---
I had a three stack team that I‚Äôd play comp with and we all had the crest. So when we revived each other it would stack, and we would ruin the other team.
---
I think sanguine alchemy is ok because of the wall hacks when using rift but it could use a bit of a buff. I‚Äôve tried it in pvp before and it‚Äôs basically like flawless execution without invisibility but on demand. Maybe the effect should last a few seconds when exiting the rift? Love the idea of giving it some love though.
---
Hive bring a- Cabal on the fi- vex on th- scorn appr- Fallen on the Horizon!
---
Yeah it should get an adjustment. Having rifts where enemies die but only in super isn‚Äôt really that good. Maybe your projectiles leave rifts on impact so you can kill enemies and support your team.
---
The Duke 44 has hip fire and opening shot which could be good
---
It can get you some cool stuff like sparrows and ships plus ornaments for exotic weapons  but I‚Äôm not exactly sure what you get with the free version of the game.
---
This is the most amazing thing to happen to ammo economy in the game. I am using it with loaded question and 21% machine gun for all the little mobs. Damaging majors and bosses with wish ender is disgusting. I hope it takes them forever to fix it.
---
Same I came looking for an answer
---
Imagine giving a damn about what's feminine and masculine jk
---
Weekly 12k xp , daily 6k xp.
---
However , some vendors like ada , spider offer less xp than the others
---
This gave me such a great idea! Exotics like lucky pants and peacekeepers aren‚Äôt used at all but if you add shield piercing rounds to the type of weapon they support would make it a really good pick for pve activities! Allowing exotics to gain these perks would make exotic primaries viable in master nightfalls and other activities with a lot of champions.
---
...pulled pork?
---
well yes but actually no
---
Play
---
Nice
---
It‚Äôs listed as a known issue on this week at bungie - probably hot fixed next week.
---
I got mine yesterday from the powerful drop from banshee after doing my 8th bounty
---
Pretty sure there's a backstory where someone like Shaxx fell several KMs through the sky doing a thundercrash.
---
It‚Äôs basically a state of mind for exos and a place on Enceladus where people were converted into exos
---
Ah, good to know. Thanks Guardian
---
It was definitely your friend. It would have error coded you if it was a bug. He just removed you
---
What shader is that?
---
he swore he didnt do it plus he was alive and moving when i got kicked
---
Hey that‚Äôs great...Now get back to work
---
The next Crucible breaking exotic
---
I was thinking pikachu because the black on the tip was like the ears....
---
You act like hunters have been mistreated the most smh
---
I mean people can do whatever they want? Yea double primaries aren't always ideal but it really doesn't matter in the end. Unless you're like raiding or doing pinnacle activities.
---
Pika ships
---
Why does crucible feel so bad?
---
If you care about the whole plot try to catch up on that watching the trailer for season of dawn. If not just take a stroll around the tower and talk to each NPC and do their quests (or to the Spider to start the Black Armory quest line).
---
I wish these stories played out in game because my damn can bungie write a fucking story.
---
I knowwww. I still have the Song Of Justice VI in my vault. I'd absolutely rock a NM cloak or ornament set with shader for that D1 style progression.
---
People who always whine about "op weapons and armor" are just projecting their suckage. Sure, there's always a meta. But I've had as much success with non-meta weapons as meta weapons. It all boils down to player skill in the end. If you use a meta weapon but still can't aim it doesnt matter what weapon you use. But I do agree to some extent that it affects performance, but not to the degree leddit is making it seem.
---
My favorite part is the fact that more people cheered for D2 then fortnite
---
^like this?

It's the passivity of it that gets me.

And the sound.

I appreciate that you're able to hear that thing charge from halfway across the map but dang if it doesn't grate after a while.

Rather than just moan though, what about counters?

What've you tried to get around it? I'm trying to be hard to hit and never stop moving.

You don't even have to transfer and equip the higher level gear.

Sekiro Snitches die twice.
---
Just a tip, (if you didnt know) dont reload or swap between kills, it seems to reset it.
---
Well, fuck.
---
1 per account :p
---
It‚Äôs one available each week
---
Hell yeah friend
---
I have this issue too, I thought it was my mouse but after changing it I think it‚Äôs to do with the game.
---
I did this once with bottom tree, prevented the enemy from capturing one and we got all 3 zones lol in IB
---
Yeah i do agree, looks really nice
---
Yeah I've asked a couple of my clan mates and they both have the same issue. It seems pretty universal.
---
Happens to me often with a sniper, did in d1 as well
---
Grinding for what?
---
I thought I was a nod to the black garden
---
Old fashioned is back too, finally!
---
Interesting.
---
wheighted knife+assasin's cowl+mote carlo=DESTRUCTION
---
you still get glimmer and gear even if you lose.
---
they just stand in one spot and shoot every few seconds
---
This is true for literally any super. If a hunter is popping golden gun at inopportune times then that is his fault.
---
Literally if a hunter can see the enemy he can kill them, he doesn't need to gap close. It's the only instant super in the game.
---
+ quests that require just to finish some matches like redrix
---
Is that sparrow real?
---
Is this PC? There is a bug at the moment where graphics settings reset every time that you launch. I've seen people that are having issues with HDR and other settings that are different to what they normally use.

You can open the chest for armour every time you finish a level 7boss now, no keys required
---
I want them to do it in gambit
---
Really ? The first time I done the EP a week ago I didn't have a decrypted key, so I couldn't open the chest !! But that was the 1st time i'd ran the task.
---
I got the IKELIOS sniper from a drop during that fight, but can't even remember what armor piece I got, i'll try running it again later then &amp; see if I can just smash out the full armor set !!
---
how does this work with tractor cannon added into the factoring? (should be 33% more damage taken from all elements except void, which is 50%?)
---
Yeah apparently he‚Äôs going to become a vendor in the hangar
---
They just dropped that change with the new season, so Tuesday it would have been live.
---
yeah it looks really good :)
---
we should have a couple weeks to get all sets
---
its prob a silver purchase :(
---
Ahhh !!!! I see, nice one, grind that later then, cheers !!!
---
meh hunters has been shafted once again
---
Exactly. I kept doing the same weapon and it wouldn't count. Then I decided to try a new one, then another new one and so on. Best of luck Guardian!
---
it might be a quest line or it shall be a silver purchase which will be 1500 silver
---
Yeah, don‚Äôt I have to do a quest to unlock the chalice?
---
Have you not activated cross save yet? https://www.bungie.net/7/en/CrossSave
---
Oh ok, I was a bit out of the loop and "beta" tend to be used as derogatory for a game being trash. Thanks for the clarification.
---
Youre underestimating the pettiness of salty game fanboys. "I dont like or play this game so its shit and dead, who plays this game?"
---
Meamwhile the game: likely the most populated than its ever been in its lifetime.
---
This is very much an Ok boomer moment
---
Did you know fallen are gay and prefer humans to other fallen? TRANSMAT FIRING!
---
Apostate is a good choice. You get it from the moon but only on certain days.
---
Ah yes because people expect different cultures to eat the same foods
---
Hmm I guess never mind then. I love like fast snipers because they shred bosses. But tbh my favorite sniper for PVP is the borealis. It feels nice and snappy and it‚Äôs a one shot to the head. Idk if it‚Äôs worth the exotic slot tho. I run better devils/borealis/bad omens.

People sometimes trash Barry Manilow for not being edgy or whatever but the guy is a genius. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Manilow - kazoo nothwithstanding. :)

Barry Manilow (born Barry Alan Pincus, June 17, 1943) is an American singer-songwriter, arranger, musician and producer with a career that has spanned more than 50 years. His hit recordings include "Could It Be Magic", "Mandy", "I Write the Songs", "Can't Smile Without You" and "Copacabana (At the Copa)".
---
He recorded and released 46 Top 40 singles on the Adult Contemporary Chart, including 13 that hit number one and 28 of which appeared within the top ten, and has released many multi-platinum albums. Although not a favorite artist of music critics, Manilow has been praised by entertainers including Frank Sinatra, who was quoted in the 1970s as saying, "He's next." In 1988, Bob Dylan stopped Manilow at a party, hugged him and said, "Don't stop what you're doing, man.

How did you get that sparrow
---
I think I‚Äôll go for beloved it seems like the best option. Can I get it by just defeating bosses on Nessus? Or do I have to have the chalice?
---
Apostate, Twilight Oath, Beloved (my fav), Tatara Gaze are all good ones
---
Hammerhead is the most used
---
Shut up and take my upvote.
---
No
---
Bows aren't even good, you're not missing anything
---
Oh yeah, you could double up on that as well, giving hunters a full super in just two dodges. Warlock could get a full super from one rift using the same method. Fortunately (because of what it did to the Crucible), Bungie was quick to disable dynamo until they've found a fix.
---
For sure! Even though they don't stack across Armor 1.0 and 2.0 you can absolutely run more super generating mods with a 1.0/2.0 hybrid build than a pure 2.0 build. Armor 1.0 also still has Heavy Lifting and Enhanced Heavy Lifting, which are unavailable on 2.0, so if you have any in your vault definitely give them a try as well! For example you could combine Enhanced Heavy Lifting on a 1.0 helmet with 2x the new mod Storm of Lead on a 2.0 class item which gives super energy on machine gun kills. I haven't tested it as I don't have Storm of Lead yet, but I imagine it could be really good too
---
There's a linear fusion rifle crucible quest, what did you expect? Thankfully the kills aren't really high, so we wont see it all season.

I've played some, still having fun so its all fine and dandy.

I'd like to see us get a community reward if pvp opposing team communication was enabled.
---
Wait I have a Xbox account theirs no way I could unlink it even if I wanted to I‚Äôll stick with my new one
---
This isn't cheating those files are just your settings config files.
---
It seems like a good one for some good old crucible. I havent even tried it because of how lackluster the TTK has been on them.

Honor Bound is given by Zavala when you talk to him it should be one of the pursuits in the bottom row of quests he can give. First step is kill bosses, get points from nightfall/strikes and then get solar kills. Second step is the same stuff but in higher quantity.
---
I got a god roll last hope, feeding frenzy multi kill clip and it shreds
---
Good ol Jango Fett, my favorite guardian
---
Still, not really if you use for add clear. If you do it like you're supposed to: weak red bars to gain stacks/reload, then chunk away orange/yellow bar (which yellow bars you usually swap to sniper or GL or super), you can do a hefty amount of damage without ever needing to reload.
---
It's useful to have a large mag...but Huck is one of the best kinetic exotics for a reason, even more so when you complete the catalyst for it.
---
Oh no its retarded
---
it may be with one of the obelisks we don't have access to yet

Are the file type correct like in this picture: [https://image.prntscr.com/image/7JXOh0YJQMWPJnv7Uw\_Ubw.png](https://image.prntscr.com/image/7JXOh0YJQMWPJnv7Uw_Ubw.png)

Tell me what you did in each step to see where it went wrong, ill be glad to help.

Both work as a form of daycare.

Thank you for clarifying. I'm gonna try it when I get home from work. I hate motion blur so much...

I am a Titan main, but love running Gunslinger. I wish the explosive knife got the ohko, but I guess that would overpower Six Shooter. I usually run Ophidia myself, but I never even really considered Dragon Shadow simply because of aesthetics, haha. I am an aggressive Titan and Warlock, hut generally have to play conservative on my Hunter. I dislike Hunters that are able to be aggressive enough to get in my face, because every time I do it I get messed up. I am super excited to try these new knives, though.
---
Nooo Daycare costs too much! Just load up fortnite and the kids sit for hours.
---
No point in me being toxic lol
---
This is one of those moments where you question if you should be alive or not lol
---
I mean in crucible it does not matter :) But otherwise maybe level up a bit and then you have higher chances :)
---
By the game he means his OEM Recluse Striker build
---
Yeah... except we're literally stronger than them.
---
In our Calus fanfic fight with Ikora we basically glass a planet and shift it off its orbit. Just because we can't do it in game doesn't mean were not canon biggest dick.
---
Saint-14 is Saint-14 because he's our #1 fan.
---
Do you have power and effieciency II?
---
If its just a raid recov, you just do the raid for him on his account
---
This one does. But how many more dont?
---
My secret is the new dungeon on the moon. Save for the chest piece. If you're on ps4 and need someone to run it with lemme know, CoRRh321BlAsToFf
---
Thanks guys!
---
BUT HES IN AUSTRALIA AND IM IN AMERICA HOW DO I GET THE MONEY
---
You log into his account and do the raid on the character he wants. Or you can invite him and teach him the raid
---
How do I unlock the chalice?
---
I strongly recommend the wish-ender from shattered throne dungeon.
---
There goes my peny...
---
OKAY THANK YOU
---
PayPal or another service like PayPal
---
Good luck
---
I DONT HAVE A PAYPAL ACCOUNT IM 15
---
THANK YOU
---
Idk mail it then
---
wdym? they are top tier, especially with two tap potential
---
also sturm can OHK so dont try to tell me that they're aids
---
Yes
---
OKAY BET THANK YOU
---
Show me a sniper rifle that needs a 533ms charge time. It does have 1 more aim assist than my Elegy without Aim Adjuster though.
---
I hate how I always get headshotted though. Seriously, how the fuck do you headshot with that thing from so far away? I can‚Äôt do shit like that in crucible
---
imagine not maiming a bow couldn‚Äôt be me
---
I don't know. I'm pretty fond of ether doctor and it's quite easy to get. Take some time to get a good one, but the dps is good for an auto kinetic and the range and recoil aren't bad either. Got a rampage + armor piercing one (i dream to roll one with this + zen moment) and it's pretty fun.
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one who thought this lol
---
I never said TF 1 was faster. Read my comment again. I said the lower TTK, or in other words the ability to kill people faster in TF2 compared to 1 made flying through the air less viable and a much riskier strategy. This lead to less movement and more stale/less fun gameplay.
---
Also the fact that the maps in TF2 were much flatter and less vertical restricted your movement also. I know they brought back Angel City but that was a bandaid on the wider problem that almost all the default maps had. 
---
Movement is absolutely better in 2, the grappling hook in particular is amazing but that doesn't take away from what I said.
---
Underrated post
---
SICK!!!
---
Yeah I am agreeing with you, but when you nerf it too much, what the incentive to use it? Look at all of the weapons and exotics that. have been left in the vault because of small nerfs. Don‚Äôt go too crazy, just a little nerf is all it takes.
---
Excellent thanks guys.
---
But how doe
---
[removed]
---
Nice xur dude totally not advertising your stream
---
This was ridiculous. Especially for the fact FFXIV was not nominated for Soundtrack even.
---
*RIDICULOUS*
---
To be fair Hammerhead was also the FIRST machine gun in D2 besides i think thunderlord.
---
What set is it based off of (if there is one)
---
I want to note it down for future fashion builds
---
I'm confused, what am I supposed to notice?
---
That‚Äôs because when black armory came out Thunderlord was the only machine gun in the game, and at that time thunderlord was only available from the temporary quest that had already ended by then.
---
I think it was yes. A regular MG that is.
---
I used to have an arsenic bite with dragonfly and explosive head before I got an archer's tempo one to drop. it wasn't the greatest weapon in the world but it did certainly make stuff go boom.
---
Last year, league of legends was a dead game too
---
you get a bow from Petra iirc for doing like 3 story missions in Forsaken
---
EXACTLY. Finally someone who understands me.
---
It really is. Please give it a chance for the Vanilla content. It will make you wanna kill yourself. (IT IS THAT BAD)
---
However. The moment you survive that and enter the first expansion ( Heavensward) .....
---
Jesus. F'ing. Christ.
---
Absolutely the best experience in an MMO Ever ( Storytelling ). And Shadowbringers? *BEST EXPANSION IN THE GOD DAMN UNIVERSE*.
---
That depends on the content - but for dps, Izanagi is still a s-tier pick. 
---
Nothing changed for heavy really - GL with the right rolls.
---
Well some of my Teammates are on the level of Tusken Raiders so why not...
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
BUT WHAT IN THE NAME OF JESUS HAPPEND TO NESSUS?
---
And it takes like a total of ten minutes or less to farm it! Doing the lost sector Kingship Dock in Tangled Shore three times and done.
---
YESSSS
---
They'll open over the course of the weeks from what I understand and eventually all be able to be linked or you'll have a limited number that you can link to the sundial.
---
Amazing! I love the exploding arrowheads mostly because of a moment I had in a 1v1 with one of my friends. 
---
*Twang of a headshot*
---
Friend, ducking into an alley: "ow."
---
*Twang of an arrow into a wall as my friend peeks*

Friend: "You missed idiot" (we poke fun at each other, not a legit insult)

Me: "No I didn't"

Anyone have a link to the original format

I'm so tired of people saying something is bad just because they don't like it.
---
Listen, I don't really like Fornite but you can't honestly say it's bad. It's updated constantly, and it probably deserves the award more than Destiny.
---
Same way "we" eat baby pigs/chickens/any other animals ? :x
---
Fallen just see us as targets, and targets make serviceable food.
---
you just finished your first huh?? dont see an emblem drop in that picture, but sure..congrats
---
Wow totally not advertising your stream, and it's not like there's an *entire website where you can just be told where Xur is in the world map*
---
Does it only come with 2 perks? Because I just did the bounty for it twice and both times got underdog and demolitionist. Also can you get rewards from the Mars link doing the Sindial or just Tangled Shore because I'm pretty sure I unlinked Tangled Shore and linked Mars and got the choice of the Auto Rifle and Sidearm again.
---
Ok some people made it sound like there was a way to activate the others but I had assumed it would be weekly rotation like most things in this game
---
Nah it's not done yet, it's just time locked. We're getting the rest on the 17th or the 24th. I can't remember which, but I'm pretty sure it's the 17th.
---
We‚Äôres Jaba the hu-I-I mean the leviathan
---
It's on the calendar https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/129/129956/Destiny_SoD_Calendar_EN.jpg
---
Looks like we get one on the 24th, and then the final one on Feb 4th
---
Let‚Äôs fix it then.
---
I still have a 74 Attack Ace, which was 10 Attack before the DLC.
---
Uriel's was the bomb man.
---
Awesome :D
---
It's not, still 15 quid on Steam tbh, though with how D2 turned out exactly like D1 I'm hesitant to give money unless there's new enemies or they don't start a new story tangent and ignore it afterwards, felt like I wasted my money on TTK since it added nothing new aside from whatever the giant lighter ship thing in space was called and a somewhat okay raid
---
*laughs in wish ender*
---
how was it i have to get my two bottom wisdom teeth removed soon im dreading it ngl
---
Song is cringe
---
I have a grave robber multikillclip one. The kill clip is awesome grave robber is ok. But I really want a feeding frenzy roll.
---
I know
---
Way of the cake.
---
Paragon mods were removed and no longer work.
---
Well of radiance makes every raid 10x easier, too tree nova is good ad clear and boss damage, bottom tree nova is good boss damage and with devour you literally can‚Äôt die, top tree daw blade lets you go Mach 30, bottom tree daw blade has amazing ad clear, storm caller has amazing ad clear and has an arc buddy, middle tree arc has great boss dps, warlock jump is great, world line skating, middle tree nova has handheld super nova and with contravers hold it recharges in seconds. Need me say more
---
I use Subtle Calamity as well. It has good impact as far as bows go but I tend to use Arsenic Bite more due to the faster draw time. Either one still needs two shots in crucible so the faster draw time is better.
---
Depends a lot what content you play, 950/980 NF and 980 nightmare hunts you need unstoppable and anti barrier mods.
---
yeah he does look good, they all look good thankfully
---
No. Saint died in the Infinite Forest, so him coming back makes sense. Cayde died in the Reef and is buried on Earth. Time dial only works in the IF on Mercury.
---
hmm we might be able to depending and bungie will let us know on there twitter
---
Yes say more
---
I mean it was not great tbh. But it was okay. The Doc stun my right cheek, which already was the most painful part of all of it :D Because afterwards it was numb. Then i just heard to cracks per tooth and they were out.   
---
But I think it is better like this than your wisdomteeth make all you teeth crooked and  you are in a lot of pain for months. Just try to see the best in it :) It is not too horrible
---
\[ Happy Titan Grunt \] :)
---
I was with you aaaaaallll the way up to the jump. I‚Äôm well known within my clan for my warlock jumps to death every, single, time!
---
now that would be cool if someone could make that
---
I kept the original damaged warlock armor and hand cannon from before new light that has a gear level of 0. It‚Äôs basically impossible to do anything with that equipped.
---
As a Titan main, I support and approve this message. Never mess with our crayons
---
thanks ok i‚Äôm gonna try and get it over with soon
---
GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAL
---
Would rather do a raid or any end game pinnacle activity with a group of warlocks over the other two classes
---
Or CSGO, TF2, and Dota2. Even if TF2 hasn‚Äôt gotten a major update in a while it still gets seasonal ones like Overwatch and the player count is a lot more than some games that came out 6 months ago.
---
I got one with multikill clip and ambitious assassin, it‚Äôs nice to reload and have 98 bullets  to just destroy everything with
---
Everytime I do Sundial, I think to myself, I'm going to try and not die this time so I can get the Triumph for it and I get to this encounter and get fucked everytime.  Damn Phalanx.
---
So you just bad... got it
---
100%
---
This is work. I already have a job. I just want to play
---
Do that :) Don't forget it is only once in a lifetime, so once you did it, you are done with it :)
---
That wouldn't make him Cayde-7, that number increases with memory resets. If he is resurrected he would still be Cayde-6
---
That you not me change that
---
new enemys cayde commits not feeling so good and you get to kill undren
---
I need this in my life. Simple, but fun. Just needs some letters scrawled out in black paint and it would be a Stranger Things theme!
---
Oh man, raining almost unlimited grenades that look like miniature suns is definitely a blast!
---
90 resilience? Isn‚Äôt that, like, a 12% shield increase?
---
The fastest xp farm right now is daily bounties on the moon.
---
And when we - hopefully - get this, please make it so we can use ornamentals on exotics aswell. Absolutely blows have to use a certain exotic for a build and it just looks way out of place with the rest of your armor.
---
Not just hunters,
---
I love it! I totally want to make one for my family's tree.
---
I do this everytime with my shoulder charge! So fun.
---
How was R6S even a nominee. That community is more saltier then the Dead Sea
---
I came back to destiny around the same time and have been playing gambit and crucible non-stop. Gambit is so much fun I aligned with the drifter when the option came up. Have yet to do any PVE stuff except a few drifter quests, lol. I‚Äôm debating getting the season pass and expansions to really dive into the game.
---
Imagine they finally release an exotic shader, and you can only wear it on one armor piece because it‚Äôs exotic.
---
I‚Äôve heard that final fantasy 14 is a good game so I wouldn‚Äôt be mad if it won over destiny, but man fuck fortnite. Plus I bet people who play it don‚Äôt even watch the game awards, but honestly every other option was better than fortnite. I didn‚Äôt myself because I knew it would happen and honestly I bet they are getting paid to choose it.
---
eh it's ok... I'm not surprised anymore
---
I was in a similar boat going for all the weapons I missed out on during my year hiatus with the game. Depends on the activity though.  For something like strikes go ahead and multitask as much as you can, that way you can switch out if you ever run out of ammo of any certain type.  For stuff like Gambit and crucible I‚Äôd recommend only running one at a time, that way you can still have something your more comfortable to fall back on if you need, especially if you need wins too and are solo.
---
Try swapping monitors??
---
You can pull it out of collections.
---
Huh, there a way to do that without destroying data limits? Makes sense that it should be able to stream. It just has to buffer, huh? But it can‚Äôt pivot.
---
That‚Äôs be the ultimate troll
---
I don't know how this applies to those categories but I mean your in charge so whatever you say works with me.
---
I think it's a problem with the season update itself, I'm getting flickers and pink flashes on a new TV and PS4 pro as well, nice to know it's not just limited to consoles.
---
Survival and survival: freelance.
---
Possibly elimination. You'd have to see if it counts for glory or valor. Glory is competitive.
---
very. My hunter sits at tier 9 with the specifically pvp gear equipped. Dodge is back up sooooooooooooo quickly. Dragon's shadow would boost that even further. Im yet to try it, but that might be getting near d1 shadestep territory on the cooldown.
---
Ahhhhhh I guess I should start now too. Haha I'm only sometimes in the middle of my team. My bf is generally always top, but only sometimes I am better than our rando team mate..
---
Are you ok?
---
Vorpal seems like a baller perk.  It‚Äôs always on.  You don‚Äôt need to proc it.  It smokes.  Add Feeding Frenzy (which is the roll I got as well) and it‚Äôs a PvE monster.  Vorpal also hits Guardians in their super harder!  Gonna have to try this.
---
Should've made her a warlock. Healing + forgiving glide
---
Impressive!
---
12 to 14 I think. It gives me a. 17 second barrier cooldown tho. So I'm happy.
---
At the beginning he has Hammerhead equipped. It‚Äôs a Heaven Machine Gun. You get it by doing Lost Forges for Ada-1.
---
The weapon at the end is Monte Carlo, the Exotic Auto Rifle. Can be found as a random drop after finishing an activity, or from exotic engrams dropped from enemies. The Monte Carlo they‚Äôre using has the Eververse Ornament equipped. You have to pay real money to get it.
---
We have finally joined the yeet. Titans have been vip chilling in it, but now we share. Let the yeet flow through your knife, hunter
---
Better yet.  
---
I would be happy to be in a mission to where we are going back to a past mercury experience.   
---
And we run into a young cayde and fight beside him for a tad.  
---
Would keep the feels of forsaken intact while also giving us another final goodbye to the gunslinger.
---
The new last hope can roll feeding frenzy + rampage. That is all
---
I just realized this meme makes no sense. The first panel guy is is in the background so obviously he is not the one being talked to in the second panel
---
She picked the Hunter I just set it up for her after explaining the classes
---
There's story in the game, but like most other games, there's lore outside of it. You really want a year long game that takes thousands of hours to play that runs you through ALL the lore?
---
Ironically that in an attempt to censor they probably taught more people the slur. Rainbow had this problem a while back I think
---
It‚Äôs not even that it‚Äôs bad, final fantasy 14 has been out for a decade and has been going strong, it doesn‚Äôt need cheap gimmicks to keep people paying/playing every week.
---
That kill on the dude who just cast golden gun made me wince for the guy lol. Beautiful yeets, sir.
---
Evolution yo
---
I mean it could be possible for him to come back tho our ghost revived our dead bodies back to life I wouldn‚Äôt see why a different ghost without a guardian could revive cayde
---
I still have 3 uriels in my vault. One Arc, one void, one solar I refuse to delete them...
---
It was a joke.
---
That‚Äôs a different guy in the background of the second panel, they just look similar. Look at the difference in the length of their beards
---
I think so, but with the menagerie you know you will definitely get it at the end. Plus if you have the rune slots unlocked you can pick the masterwork.
---
Take her into a raid lol you can do the first 2 right off the bat
---
Uldren is currently miserable sitting with his ghost crying about why people scream at him when he‚Äôs spotted.  
---
Let him continue to sulk for another year.
---
That would be awesomee, to run with him before all his resets.
---
Hawthorne was trusted with colonel
---
Tell him to...*stick around*
---
The story wasn't great but it was fun when it came out. It was exciting to finally get to go to Mercury outside of crucible, finally meet Osiris, get a cool new public event, finally a vex expansion, and the hype to facing off against the infinite mind. The reskinned strike story missions were a disappointment, Osiris's involvement was weak, red legion was present but their involvement was also weak, we didn't get a proper raid, but the experiencing everything in the beginning was pretty fun.
---
Light.gg does a nice job of explaining what perks you may want for each weapon ranked into tiers. It's pretty great
---
I love the fake drop lol
---
All depends on your play style. Do you like to be up close or a bit a ways from the fight?
---
PpppIIiIiIiikkkKkKkKkIiIiIaaaaaaacccchhhhhuuuuuuuuuu
---
I know that happened to me at one point a bunch of years ago. Something censored ‚Äúwop‚Äù from my misspelling of ‚Äúswoop‚Äù (swop) and I learned the slur for my own people, the Italians.
---
I've done this every week since the bug was released. Finally got a curated nation of beast from it as well.
---
Which would be more worth it to get. I don‚Äôt know which one to get.
---
Not really how about mowing adds down with sunshot graviton lance or Prometheus lens or top tree golden gun
---
I tried grinding Hush with it but the draw time is so damn slow, even after I put seasonal draw enhancement + normal draw enhancement on my arms. I'm using The Spiteful Fang (with a dogshit roll) just because of how good the draw time is.
---
Which one should I mainly go for. Beloved or Dust?
---
It's a known issue. From the TWAB yesterday:
---
Resonant Stems are not providing Override Frequencies when consumed.
---
I'd be down for different exotic catalysts that added different effects.
---
Trinity just feels too chunky and you‚Äôll have to use some mods to make it work. The lemon is much easier to use and poison Aint half bad either
---
Without destroying data limits not really no. I run into like 200gb monthly. I also constantly stream and game. Only reason it works this well for me is because TMobile has a "national tethering plan". 50gb a month of unthrottled data and unlimited data that only gets throttled if the tower gets busy. Satellite will always have a longer buffer time with the ping. High-speed is around 20-50ms and when I had satellite it was about 2000ms (roughly 2 seconds per action) check into your local mobile carriers and what they offer for tethering plans. There's also ways to "hide" your data to avoid throttling but if they catch that, they generally terminate your service.
---
This was about final fantasy losing, also mediocre? How? Gunplay is better then let‚Äôs say borderlands, you have specific load outs with unique enemies and interesting locations and activities. If your saying season 1-3 and season 8 were bad ok then but you obviously aren‚Äôt.
---
Oof dude can you imagine if we both got on the same team?!? Lol
---
Imagine how easy it was for elastic girl to give birth. She could probably literally say, ‚ÄúI birth you, I can undo that.‚Äù
---
When I change the file name to .old and .tmp it still keeps the file type at .xml -__-
---
The fact that you even tried telling them too
---
K Bro.  Whatever you say. Lol
---
Yeah I've heard that can happen on all plates including in the puzzle room if you jump off of them lol safer to just walk off
---
No prob, port forwarding is always good to know  (I should look into too). If you decide to go with the mobile network route, it is possible to use a router with it to allow as many devices as needed on the network. Just a lil bit of a setup.
---
Thanks for giving up and giving me this win to this super important internet argument since you don‚Äôt have a good defense
---
This should be a thing, why isn't this a thing?
---
Alright don‚Äôt make fun of me... I think the grind for the hush was worth it.
---
r/fireteams
---
I don't understand having that much. Mine is at 48/500.
---
You have a good day! Shaxx believes in you.
---
This had me lost for months... I should've googled this ever since as I missed the weekly bounty rewards from him ever since cuz I couldn't figure it out.
---
It did get the underdog perk ;)
---
I'm pretty sure exotic drop rates were buffed because las season I got an average of 3 or 4 exotics every day
---
Isn‚Äôt he Greek? 
---
His accent definitely sounds more Greek than Russian thanks to the amount of hours I‚Äôve played in AC: odyssey lol
---
Infinite Void Grenade (Contraverse Hold + Slowva Bomb) build, Infinite Void Grenade (Contraverse hold + Void Warp + Fast Ball mod) = Hand held super nova hallway clear (PvP),  SSJ/Kamehameha build (Middle tree Arc + Geomag Stabilizers + Arc secondary), Well of radiance. Warlocks have some serious wrecking builds
---
Thanks
---
 Shin Malphur's ghost isn't his original ghost. So... we don't actually know completely how that works.
---
Doon the Lord's work sir.
---
Well i guess it's up for interpretation but he gets some serius lsd type shit and a thing makes him see his sister and stuff it's pretty cool if u ask me ;D(this is in forsaken)
---
All of the above
---
Also, i'm getting pretty much network errors since season's start. Did somebody else notice it or it's only me?
---
Edge Transit
---
True, imma delete my comment as I have no idea
---
 They killed him because the VA was leaving. He wasn't even voiced by Fillion IN Forsaken.
---
Some of lore isn‚Äôt that hard to piece together. 
---
Shit, the ‚Äúgood‚Äù Fallen thing has been a theory since early in D1.
---
I thought Shaxx only said this to me.......damn
---
got it now, i just had to play a bit of the initial quests
---
I mean... You can get Wish Ender by doing The Shattered Throne twice. It might take some effort solo but max 3 hours involvement
---
I think it‚Äôs 2x3
---
Its a bug, same here aswell!
---
Guess they want you to buy stuff lmao.
---
its amazing how all of his quotes are just him being sarcastic if you're not a good player. like whenever i get a kill or two and he freaks out its just to make fun of how bad i am lol
---
He made it himself.
---
Nope it's a glitch, they've acknowledged it.
---
I dont get it
---
Yeah, at first I thought it was a very unsubtle way to say ‚ÄúBuy Something!‚Äù
---
Freakin bloobs
---
He's Greek
---
mmmeeeeeeee
---
New ritual wep Haidn know come on
---
Nono dude, i wasn't mad at you ahahahahahah. I was angry that i lost so much time on swapping monitors xD
---
Sounds kinda stupid tbh but hey it's Bungie the same people who made you go to a completely separate website for lore in Destiny 1 after finding the grimoire cards lol
---
Its a off brand

Individual weapons power level also affects it.
---
Bungie, we need a finisher that is just us flinging ourselves at the enemy.
---
Frankly I was kinda thinking it could use a little buff. It's not really used in PvE, and it's honestly quite bad in PvP, there's a reason you never saw it used before there was a quest.
---
As it stands it's just a worse sniper with no real upside. It technically has higher base damage, but it has significantly less crit. 
---
I don't really think there's ever a reason to choose it over say Tartara Gaze
---
I save the clips, edit it and add music in Adobe Premier pro then upload it

I know this isn't the proper place to ask this, but I didn't see a Q/A thread and I didn't feel this warranted it's own topic. So my question is that I own everything up to current content on PC, and I own up to Forsaken on console. I was thinking of making the switch from PC to console, so do I have to buy Shadowkeep + the latest season, or just the latest season to do current content?  
---
I know Bungie explained this a while back when they first introduced this system, but it never really made sense to me how it works.
---
Your free to have that opinion and all but why are you commenting a second time after 7 hours? I‚Äôm pretty sure this post is dead now.
---
Lol i have not even tried pvp yet still grinding to 950.
---
Good luck and Happy Hunting
---
This made my girlfriend and me chuckle lmao
---
Then after I stopped thrusting. Only then. I looked into their eyes and said "whose next?"
---
Try them all out and see which one works the best for you. Solar is based more around range, while Arc is more of a melee based super. Void gets a little of both with its ability to throw it's shield and melee bash. Personally I prefer void with its ability to block aswell. 
---
Insurmountable Skullfort paired with top tree striker, is extremely good if your a close range player. The exotic allows to you never run out of melee energy (rarely it bugs out and you lose energy)
---
Hallowfire Heart is definitely an awesome starter exotic, but definitely not the most optimal for PvP if that's what you're looking for. 
---
By far the most popular super in PvP for Titans is bottom tree striker, but don't be a follower. Try them all out, and decide for yourself.
---
Dude, we have flying fucking fireballs coming towards you. Idc how trash it is that‚Äôs badass
---
*960
---
Arbalest HS's do less damage than most snipers though.
---
Dope as fuck.
---
999? If you crazy serious lol
---
Mission accomplished
---
No the soft cap is 960 now
---
Ha for me its the opposite, win lots of gambit but lose lots of crucible (especially survival)
---
Arbalest only has 61 aim assist, which is mediocre at best.

Great work Guardian! However loot/roll/achievement posts are prohibited to prevent our subreddit from being cluttered (we get way too many!) - please keep these submissions in the weekly pinned loot/achievement thread. Thanks!

If you've got a question concerning if a roll you've got is good or not, try /r/ShardItKeepIt !
---
It‚Äôs ‚Äúbugged‚Äù because they want you to keep stopping by the store to buy stuff

If you're going to post gameplay video or screenshots, please make sure it is not from a phone or similar recording, and is a direct capture, thanks!

I‚Äôm sorry - how do u farm this thing exactly ?
---
I am really bad at jumping too, it helped me to put a couple mobility mods on to help with the jumping.
---
*laughs in handheld supernova*
---
I feel your pain bro!
---
Only ever got one arsenic bite, with dragonfly and explosive head
---
Use Cerberus in pvp and dominate everything
---
I got my mobility to max helped but still no completion sadly .
---
Shoulder charging that group of Cabal war dogs is easily the most pleasing aspect of that strike.
---
Bow is rewarded from Petra after forsaken campaign bois üòâ
---
Also it‚Äôs a dollar a rank so just casually play through the season and buy em if you feel like doing that at the end to save some money
---
Known bug
---
He always says "ah one of our best" i guess cuz place 2nd at the end that or first im actual pretty good so it just makes me feel better shaxx best character
---
Izanagi seems pretty lengthy, are the forges soloable/are people still doing them?
---
I don‚Äôt know how to respond.
---
I mean... Enhancement cores/etc are essentially Strangifiers that also boost one stat on the weapon...
---
Thanks, I'll check it out
---
People are still doing them pretty actively, the length is really up to rng tbh
---
They did... except poor Sleeper
---
It doesn't need a nerf but it's aim assist is kinda dumb on pc atleast one guy was Shooting the Floor Not at me the floor and headshotted me
---
Is not that hard to counter, just move.
---
He's on the Mercury map, at the top. There is a separate icon for him.
---
If you haven't complete Curse of Osiris, it might not be available yet.
---
The people who think it's dead don't know its FTP. It's not that surprising how a polished game, with lots of free content and a high degree of publicity, could manage to draw in a sizable FTP demographic. It was only ever the price gouging that kept D2 from being more of a thing earlier. A little bit like how Battleborn and Paladins both tried to ride the Overwatch hero-shooter train, but since Paladins was FTP from the start it had no problem building a playerbase out of people who couldn't afford (or weren't yet sold on) Overwatch, while Battleborn tried to compete in the paid gaming marketplace with a similar level of (admittedly pretty decent) content and it flopped, mostly just because the demands of the audience are a lot higher when you expect them to buy in before they get to try the game out.
---
Does that mean i have to redo it cuz when i came back all my gear was 750 and sone new places unlocked for me and overriden my progress
---
As a crucible rookie with barely a 1.05 KD, I think of it as Shaxx attempting to fostera positive mentality in us and praising effort over results. Shaxx isn‚Äôt dad... Shaxx is coach. Shaxx believes in you, unlike dad...
---
It's a PC problem too
---
Not sure.
---
Nothing was overwritten, they just changed the baseline Power to 750 when Shadowkeep released.
---
All progress should've stayed the same. You might not have Mercury unlocked or something. But he is on the Mercury map. You can't miss him.
---
"I don't go past 6, you hear me?!"  
---
It pains, but no. Never. He's gone. Shiro for Hunter Vanguard.
---
I havee mercury unlocked amd the triumphs to prove it
---
Probably shouldn't have fooled around with the Drifters sister....
---
People have already said higher difficulties of the ordeal. Otherwise an exotic in the wild has a chance of dropping in lieu of your prime engram drops
---
I like how you're clearly just like. "Oh. Well, ok then. Guess I'll go this way."
---
Just thought of it.
---
Am sorry
---
If Titans eat crayons so do hunters
---
Dude that makes no sense Xur is not affected by the season
---
Pulled a sneaky on us
---
You wana get Ophadia Spathe on Guardian, twice the knifey fun
---
It‚Äôs the new Sidearm from SoD. Tangled Shore Beacon
---
Fellow guardian can you provide a source? Please and thanks
---
Looks like the connection got interrupted between the 2 teams. Screen didn't change for invader being o. Your side and the game didn't register any damage on the primevals on that end screen.
---
I have more armor 2.0 exotics in the vault than your total lol. How do you achieve such minimalism?
---
Forgive me, but who is Xur?
---
Maximise the discord window so its fullscreen. Might fix it.
---
That‚Äôs why I think momentum control is the most balanced pvp has ever been. Class ability advantages/disadvantages are negligible and opens the door to many other guns that aren‚Äôt in the current meta
---
Not calling you a liar, but I have literally not once ever heard someone say that. I thought Gandalf was a well done character arc.
---
It definitely did! thank you for your business, and anyone else who wants free caries i charge $300 for Lunas and then +$150 for Not Forgotten. DM if interested
---
"THIS IS AMAZING"
