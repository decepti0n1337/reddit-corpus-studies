I would prefer Well if Radiance for my play style. Stuff that helps keep me alive longer with the healing grenades and the super Well. I might feel different if I had Geomag Stabilizers. 
---
---
---
Is it really worthy to masterwork it...?
---
It’ll probably be  — at least in PvP — only a problem on PC 
---
Does this count as a 360 noscope?
---
Unlucky! I think I’ve had near enough 10 now. But I play quite a bit of gambit. 
---

---
I’ve been very unlucky with exotics since forsaken dropped though.
---
I mean I main warlock and I'm glad they nerfed nova warp it is stupid broke
---
I pass it on my way to and from school
---
Ya, it's a Duke Mk44, with the y1 raid shader.
---
Duke Mk44
---
Haha, yeah, 360 hip fire headshot.
---
What roles?
---
Yes she plays well warlock. 2 warlocks have not worked well for us this far
---
I guess I’m a little confused.
---
You mean when you use the consumable that guarantees a piece of armor?
---
I'm doing this right now...
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I think I'm gonna go insane.
---
so making fist of havoc attacks cost 85% less super energy is ok but spectral blades lasts to long?? wut? lol 
---
Hope you get banned
---
As another warlock main, I don't think it was that bad. A bit overtuned but not broken. That being said, I still used chaos reach over Nova warp because it looks awesome, especially in gambit.
---
Good ol' Ghostcrawler. 
---
Outlaw and Rampage. Also have a rapid fire kill clip, and rapid fire rampage, but i like outlaw / rampage more...
---
Just do one round forge, the step three gave you as many as possible 
---
Chaos reach is so fun in gambit
---
I would try Chaos Reach then. It’s better for being able to stick near your teammate and strike at range than Nova Warp. 
---
Well no but you posted a passive aggressive message and got a passive aggressive response. There are tons of things I don’t have the money for so I get it.
---
I don't buy from our I have most exotics I've been playing for about half a year
---
yes
---
This includes gear/weapons in your vault. 
---
Wait do the odds increase the more you run the raid?
---
Yeah. Or maybe something like a new perk called "Quick Draw" or something where it halves the speed to pull back a bow, but reduces the impact. And a new exotic where that's one of the perks and it has something like Le Monarche with say a pulse grenade esque effect
---
Jotun only drops upon completion of a powerful frame. You can complete all of the frames at Bergusia. 
---
r/beetlejuicing
---
Yeah did 2 powerful frames on my warlock got it on my 1st frame completion on my hunter. Same with the Jotunn had only one powerful frame with my hunter because of a glitch and got the fusion on my 2nd powerful frame completion on my warlock. 
---
Was my first complete good looking set so though I'd spoil myself lol
---
:(  
---
Won't be buying forsaken then
---
He wasn't being a douche? How is he supposed to know you made a mistake and replied to the wrong comment? You also didn't need to include the end of your reply to him as if your method is the only method that's good to use, it's not.
---
...lol cant tell if your joking or if you dont actually play the game 
---
Won't count I don't think.
---
Ultimately there's nothing you can do beyond buying the DLC'S. (Afaik)
---
As said in flavour text, theyre just post-collapse Dark Age weapons that the Drifter happened to keep. Butn sure the writers will give it backstory
---
It’s super random really. Sometimes lots of wins sometimes losses. Time and commitment 
---
Where did you get these, if you don’t mind me asking? I only have the three listed on the Bungie Store website, plus my preorder Cayde from GameStop. 
---
Solo competitive is a trash can. Avoid if possible as it depends on lucky matchmaking.  
---
Two problems costed me a lot of points and nerves:  
---
1. Occasional 2v4 or even 1v4 games. There's no backfill. If someone disconnects during loading for some reason, you are screwed. 
---
2. Bad players in general. You can be a god, but you won't carry players with 0.07 efficiency (seriously had a teammate with such efficiency after the whole game) vs a stack of titans with lunas and one-eyed masks.
---
Cause you're the only one that would waste your time down voting my harmless comment that was meant for the tool that burns down PE bosses to troll other players. That is all, good day to you sir
---
Proud of you kid 
---
I got to 1400 solo then started looking on LFG for good stacks to play with. Just keep at it 
---
I care. That's a great achievement in my opinion. I hope to achieve that one day. Not sure if I'm skilled enough though.
---
I got mine running a silver hand cannon frame 
---
Ok bye
---
:)
---
Private matches don’t count. 
---
I completed the Fighting Lion catalyst well after the event around Halloween. Was the longest one I've had to do yet. 
---
That’s the eververse store 
---
Nice *looks at stats* (☉_☉)
---
10 Mobility 
---
4 Resilience 
---
0 Recovery? 
---
How did you beat the bug? I'm stuck on my hunter. My rare bounty was complete 12 daily's and a weekly bounty from Ada and I had already turned in my weekly 
---
Dang it. I can’t buy the DLC. 
---
Somebody give this puppy a treat
---
That's unfortunate, friend. If you ever get the oppertunity, the forsaken+season pass is more than worth it.
---
I was exited to get the Lemon but I just got the spiteful fang last night with rampage. Kinetic spot plus it doesn't take an exotic slot, so I'll probably use that more. Gotta save the energy spot for the jotunn when I finally get it. Hopefully 
---
Can't get past 560 light level. Game just keeps giving me Titan marks and I sort of just lost interest. Is the crucible still trash?
---
Hopefully so. I'm still needing to finish up the Izanami forge and work towards 650, I'm 630 at the moment
---
Yeah those are the same thing. Anything that says “ powerful gear” as a reward for finished a task is a power full drop. You will want to wait to complete those until You reached I believe 500 light. That is the soft cap. You gear will drop based on your light level. Join. A clan too it can be very helpful. Which class did you pick ? Titan , warlock , or hunter ? 
---
This from Titanfall? Idk, it looks familiar tho
---
O_o
---
No destiny 2. 
---
Awesome. Gonna see if I can get a hold of some. 
---
The beginning I'm awful at PVP☹
---
Without a Destiny 3 players wouldn’t be able to petition every 5 minutes to bring back old weapons. That would mean no Reddit, which we like and need. 
---
So technically they are doing the community a favor. 
---
Not sure if r/woooosh or dataleak
---
It's Halo 5 lol. And, despite what people may say, it's still alive and Warzone Firefight is super fun
---
Thanks guys this really helps
---
I finally opened that up last night. Long quest. Ironically seemed liked the easiest forge. At least the boss goes down in seconds with the Sleeper. Step 8 on the quest tho, load out locked and if you die you get returned to orbit 
---
Congrats! Got it a couple of days ago myself, it’s a great feeling! Luna’s Howl also takes a bit getting used to but the payoff is great. 
---
I’ve been playing for a few months, at 600 light I’ve only gotten 3 exotic drops. 
---
Good luck with that. Seems like they only shipped preorders to stores.
---
Also tells me this split has been coming since summer. None of the merchandise for Forsaken came out in sept, didn’t even make it out for holiday shopping. How’s that for not making money Activision?
---
went back to slova bomb becuase I use contraverse hold with it. SO while skull is great for that sub class I do like the infinite gernades i get with contraverse hold fits my play style more. 
---
Yeah? I've been looking into hopping back in
---
Was the frame from the previous week? I to was holding out, but any non powerful frame from the week before turns into a powerful frame on reset. 
---
Aww boo society. 
---
Aww, boo society. 
---
i like D2.but my only problems are the weapons variety and no love for solo players.imo
---
After years of playing as only a titan, I finally took the leap and made a second character, really excited! Can anyone give me some tips on how to play as a hunter?
---
AAAAAAAAAAAJHJHGHJFJFJ que fea voz de Shaxx en español
---
I'm on the very last step where I got the bow frame, and I got a rare bounty for killing things with only black armory weapons on. By the way, if you get that bounty, the remade weapons with the letters and numbers after the name don't count. Wish they would've specified "Forge Weapons" like Hammerhead and Tatara Gaze
---
Nothing like the announcer saying you have enough to summon the primeval and that one teammate with 13 running around.
---
Bump for later
---
congrats bro &lt;3
---
That exotic is so fun to use but it's ashame it looks so damn ugly. Can't wait until they release an ornament for it
---
Yeah I got a rare bounty for breaking down one of the weapons with numbers but it has disappeared from my inventory 
---
PUBG...
---
JK Destiny 1
---
For a while now, or maybe since the first time we got to visit the Queen? Can't remember exactly but it's been that way for a bit. 
---
Knowing Bungie it wouldn't suprise me but they listed it in their known issues list so I don't think so.
---
[link](https://imgur.com/a/y3svHqd)
---
Man, i need a warlock one haha
---
To do what? Put effort into a drawing? Fuck off
---
Funny thing is, I find it to be the opposite; round 2 is pretty easy for me, but round 1 I die a billion times from shanksplosions.
---
Not very funny 
---
Virtual stairs to much for your thumb to move a stick?.... ffs people are lazy these days..
---
it doesn’t help that most of the maps are pretty close range anyways, with only a few that actually have long distance sightlines (though you’ll get beat out by pulses half of the time anyway)
---
more damage and better homing on the clusters
---
You can’t let more then 2 vex get past the gate either. 
---
Its a cool armor set, but why is it saying only 10 armor. Is that the dare part?
---
Great job dude! Don't let anybody tell you that it's not a fantastic accomplishment. Because it is!
---
Flapjack says it all the time.
---
Wish 15?
---
I hear a lot about this gun( and have been killed by it once or twice) explain it to me. What is so great about it?
---
It’s strange they brought it back. It wasn’t very amazing in D1 and was way to ugly to wear unless it was God tier. 
---
I don’t plan to. After buying the ultimate edition on launch and forsaken I feel I’ve spent enough on this game already. It’s getting out of hand 
---
Ive been in qp with a player using Dust Rock (Dust Rock not Dusk btw) and he was basically cyberbullying people with how much better he was than everyone else
---
Ok thank you
---
I appreciate the heads up
---
Hunters got great buffs though?
---
Why rip blade barrage? Self damage doesn’t change much
---
Try r/fireteams for that kind of request. Be sure to include platform as well. 
---
Ok thanks
---
Your NAT open?

Oh this is too good😂👌

Those sandshoes though... 
---
Looks like a Coldheart ornament to me but I couldn't say which.
---
Haha, yea the PvE enemies tend to know this a bit better than the average PVP player. Its really nasty in Gambit too!
---
Pretty well thought out post Sir. Interesting comparison. Thank you Guardian!
---
we can just pull one from collection and give it to him. just costs a few glimmers, weapon materials and legendary shards anyway
---
I know right?!
---
by love i mean they give squads the easy end of the stock while we get the burnt one
---
I'm not even sure Fist of Havoc would have killed from there. The kill range is pretty small.
---
Happy cake day
---
Too be perfectly honest the game is in its best state that's it's ever been in so yea. you should pick the game back up 
---
500 billion? 
---
What's with the "we" when it's only you who wrote anything?
---
So many bow frames. I dream of bow frames and they terrify me.
---
*million. My bad. Thanks for correcting my dumb ass.
---
Yeah have fun with the catalyst lmao but good for you though man.
---
yep movement to me is close to useless. 3/9/7 hunter 2/9/8 titan 1/9/9 warlock lmao
---
I got kindled with surrounded and rampage. And ringing nail with zen and rampage. Should I use my surrounded mod.on my kindled
---
100% true. And what's even better is when you play opposite with like a shotgun and have 12 motes your dick cheese teammates steal your 3 motes from your kills when they have 0 currently 
---
Same here I hope I get it to drop this week
---
aah I think you can see the full set if you look up the black armory trailer it shows all 3 sets 
---
Looks like Gary Busey
---
All good! Lol thought that was a big investment. Unlike 500mil
---
Ahh thanks bud
---
Call me Kevin fans unite to save Beowulf’s karma
---

---
Kill the Titan. OEM does not work when they are in the respawn screen.
---
EA SHILLS EVERYWHERE
---
Hey, it would still be a better use of money than Trump’s wall. And it didn’t put millions in financial jeopardy.
---
But that’s not much of a challenge. Lol.
---
Find a discord with loads of people
---
Oh I was actually talking about telesto. Breakneck is the Gambit grind. If I started it right now do you think I would have time to finish it?
---
Great job! and please don't think I'm trying to be a dick or to bring you down in any way but shouldn't the flames be coming in from the other way? 
---
I had to do 25 forges for my rare bounty 🙄
---
Just did the Throne yesterday, I’m close!
---
It's got drop mag, outlaw and explosive payload.
---
Oof, that's a lot of runs but you definitly got a great roll in the end! 
---
Yeah that’s what I did, I also tried using subtle calamity 2 shot shield and hit adds without wasting to much special. My biggest problem is once I hit them they liked to hid behind any cover the could find. 
---
I care. This motivated me to start getting mine.
---
Thanks man, it's been a lot of grinding.
---
Bungie has provided tons of QoL fixes similar to this one. I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't fix this minor annoyance in a future QoL update. 
---
The story is continuing through dreaming city. 3 weeks ago we got a new cut scene that showed Uldren being resurrected as a Guardian.
---
All you need to do is just do it once more then it will give you credit for it, did the same to me when I was collecting glimmering amethyst, it showed 100% but it wasn't completed so I didn't one more public event and it gave me the credit for it
---
Crimson would have been clutch. I literally used a year 1 better devils for mine since I did it right when Forsaken came out it was still good lol
---
Why would it become F2P?
---
I didnt much care for Better Devils on the pvp side of the game. I had that step done in 3 matches with the crimson since i had decent aim and that kick up was perfect. 
---
Become Legend indeed. Holy hell.
---
"seriously, never again"
---
BD is basically irrelevant now. I used to use it all the time in crucible so I was good with it. Found it quick and easy to get my headshots 
---
The Update for that comes on January 15th. I hope it helps for that kind of issues.
---
I was literally doing a TL;DR for you and don't have any personal experience with it. But my understanding would be yes 84 will be more vertical than 69 just because it ends in a 4 instead of a 9.
---
Eyeslauna wants a word
---
Well, ill be trying that tmw
---
Meanwhile, warlocks:  
---
[https://i.imgur.com/JfBUx4G.gif](https://i.imgur.com/JfBUx4G.gif)
---
That explains why. I juet beat forsaken a little while ago so I'm catching up on more still.
---
Just about to try it myself. I main hunter but I'm not sure of I want to run tether or warlock or titan.
---
Marks aren't up to par with bonds? You're mistaken friend. Lil arms band while Titans get future kilts and Hunters get capes. Warlocks need better class items 
---
It's like a much more localised BFG.
---
Bet you won't do it again with full reverie dawn gear 🤔
---
Just remember guys, when there 2 or 3 motes left, banking 15 motes does nothing agenst the enemy side, other then making them laugh at your stupidity. It won't spawn a taken orge to thier side. It will treat it as if you are banking 2 or 3 motes regardless. 
---
What happened??
---
God I love you for this 
---
Yis
---
Don't forget to say hi to Opelix
---
(p.s gimme your shards) 
---
Now it’s throw the fucking battery at the forge! Is that so much to ask.
---
And that's a bet you'll win 😂
---
It’s a random drop, but it can only be dropped while completing a powerful weapon frame. So.... small window.
---
That 98 is always mildly infuriating 
---
Thanks!
---
Well thank you. I tried my best  c:
---
That’s understandable though, it’s hardly possible to pick them up in the first place and when you do try to, a teammate on the other side of the map has already picked them up.
---
couldn't you do it by sitting in the back and letting your teammates kill everything? Basically avoiding death the entire time and letting your teammates die, then run it again with your 2nd teammate then your third? At least for the add/boss fights. Hell you might be able to do it the entire time as long as the boss fight has the teleport for it.        
---
Then again it has been a while since i last played it myself so I could be forgetting things.
---
I’ve never seen something so calculated before..
---
Nice, now do the ultimate end game. Teach a bunch of blueberries how to LW/ SOTP
---
It's for solo flawless just me bud
---
He loved me he told me so. I wasn't interested so I told him to jog on
---
welp my bad. I don't know how to read it seems! Well done, my friend!
---
Thank you sir :)
---
It's not gonna be F2P, just buy it.
---
It's no longer a powerful frame when you do it once, which you need for Jotuun
---
Aka looks like a brick, hits like a bigger brick. One of my favorite guns in D2.
---
is it becoming a problem? my last 3 gambit matches I was in and my team barely did anything other that sat by the bank
---
Are you fricking kidding me???? What in the actual fuck???? Hell no. Not happening unless they let me get to like 900 light haha
---
Probably just getting game completions for Malfeasance. 
---
Didnt mean to chad on you 😎
---
I’m talking no attempt at all just killing shit and then going to the next wave like they had no idea you have to pick em up an bank em me and one other person did all the banking and our team just got smoked needless to say. 
---
I just keep for others so they get more while I just help them kill and invade. 
---
All the damn time 
---
Believe it or not, most 5500 players don't want to come up against players at lower glory. I'm looking forward to Matchmaking being sorted in the next update 
---
It is necessary. Like it or not.
---
Why they all come from good shows at least
---
Most I guess. But this didn't stop them to tbag me for no reason. I guess that's what happen after so much crucible competitive 
---
I dropped one from volundr forge , so don't lose ur hope guardian!!!
---
Yeah the Crucible can be a toxic place sometimes. GL on the grind when the update happens 
---
honestly i felt pretty bad for getting it on my first clear, i even got the exotic sparrow too
---
Find a clan for ypurself, it a closer comunity so you will definatelly find some good sherpas there
---
Get forsaken but hold out on the annual pass there at rumors that Bungie want to make destiny free to play since it is splitting from Activision. Only rumors though 
---
Third shot missed critical and did ~730k
---
Got this today too, Love 150 scouts.
---
Like a miniature sarlaac pit 
---
No, but it has so much aim assist you can shoot someone in the foot and get a head shot. So yes actually 
---
Yeah its not going to be f2p
---
I made it to the ogre fight and got horrible destroyed by as. Congrats
---
Indeed. Slower kill time than shards but great for ad clearing. I use it on gambit quite a bit.
---
Ahh! Congrats! Two days ago I tried the same: started the shattered throne to get the ahamkaras but I abandoned when I got to the ogre boss with the crystals. Any tips for that part?
---
Forsaken yes Black armory no despite being in the name there are no exotic "armors" in the "dlc" even CoO had exotic armors..
---
wish for no afks in forges
---
Wait until you discover free Photoshop alternatives on PC, like GIMP (VERY unfortunate acronym).
---
Use the companion app or the destiny 2 discord, tons of lfg there. Fireteams or destinysherpa here on reddit helps newcomers too 
---
How long did that take?
---
**Score: 0**
---
Feels bad.
---
Yeah I’ve got this too this week, wanted to grind for a better kindled orchid and can’t now. It’s so goddam annoying, and the only “solution” from Bungie is to wait for the weekly reset, which is such a cop-out of a response. What a fucking joke.
---
An hour
---
Me and my friend tried it twice. Just us. Made it to the Ogre, found a third on Fireteams and he didn't show. Blocked him, gave up for 3-6 weeks. Tried again with a third friend, made it to the last boss and failed. After seeing that solo Celestial Nighthawk post a few days ago I really want to try it again with Banner Shield and two Celestial Nighthawks. Wish me luck...
---
Exotic Armor is only 1 of 34 armors that can have "Enhanced" Perks along with the 2 Raid armors &amp; Dreaming City so be VERY sure to check them for any perk that starts with Enhanced, such as "Enhanced Heavy Lifting" on helmets which can be a good tier perk getting your super back insanely fast with a LMG + Ads. Or "Enhanced Hand Cannon Targeting" that will help you greatly land hand Cannon shots in both PvP and PvE. Even if say you hate hand cannons and swear you will never use them don't delete it, the more experience you get the more your play style and load out will change and you will be using different guns the better you get. Also another tip, your class item/armor (Warlock Bond, Hunter Cloak, Titan Mark), the first perk you should always look for is Recuperation, where picking up an Orb instantly heals a portion of health, try and save Recuperation Class Items with all different secondary perks like Heavy Ammo Finder, Fusion Rifle Reserves, Linier-Fusion Rifle Reserves, Ect, that way when the time comes and you get say 1000 voices, Sleeper Simulant, Anarchy, or any end game meta weapon that greatly benefits from at least 1 reserve or scavenger perk you already have some there in your vault ready to infuse instead of grinding trying to find the exact one you need after you get the weapon lol.
---
Looks like MC Hammer came back to be a space ninja. 
---
It's funny how you specify "in Destiny 2" on the Destiny 2 subreddit
---
I'm now going to call hunters space ninjas from now on. Thank you for this. 
---
The raidsecrets-sub has a pinned post with how all the puzzles were solved
---
My first frame dropped with firefly and rampage (with a range masterwork) 
---
Be a man and invade with 15 motes.  
---
FTFY
---
yea but it dosen t matter if you are always bombarded with depozit blocks and invaiders
---
Holy shit, you gotta have to have a sore back after carrying them that far!!  
---
Very nice stuff. You play on PC?
---
GG!
---
Gotta love the name of that Triumph
---
Snowflakes will always find something to whine about regardless lol. Also you can't reach 385 anymore, might save you a headache knowing that lol with forsaken they removed weapon and armour mods that give +5 power. Gear will not drop over 380, people used mods to get to 385. Not possible anymore. 380 is your cap.
---
The evil whatsits! Thank you :) I just tried Nightfall oh my god I die before I kill anything.
---
What's so awful about it?
---
God damn, impressive stuff!! Took me 2 hours to get through the first bit, gave up after that. 
---
How did they steal your light level?
---
GNU Image Manipulation Program.
---
I mean... it's memorable at least?
---
Good to know, the perfect 5th is such a bitch
---
“It’s not a bug, it’s a feature”? You’ve not heard that? It’s just a joke
---
Never heard of it.
---
Two of us tried to do it but we kept getting wiped at the ogre/wizards room and finally gave up. Please share some of your tips.
---
Do you guys do much group activities? I’m in a clan which is dead and I can be on for over 12 hours a day. Would love a clan to raid with (to get Rivensbane) and have regular clan runs of other activities in our time zone. 
---
I was doing a purification ritual so I had full Reverie Dawn gear on
---
Gave it a shot and it worked out this app is incredible. I might be able to do raids too. Thanks everyone!
---
Triumph name checks out
---
I read it mist be on bergusian forge only though, is it true?
---
I am sitting at Level 31 with 297 light, and i was wondering when the Leviathan raid will show up on my map. I would figure it would be there by now, do I have to do something before? 
---
They’ll eventually be back but could/will be a while
---
Just buy it. It won't become F2P and is worth the money. 
---
One of my fave hunter sets. Wish it had perks T_T
---
Oh no i was using my lmg on the warden 
---
Radar
---
TIL that Arcstrider has combos. Now I’m more excited about the changes. 
---
The fuck is this?
---
I learned yesterday that if both teams suck enough the drifter gets fed up and summons the primeval for both teams without needing 75 motes banked. But hey on the bright side both teams sucking this bad let me solo the triumph for winning a game with 100+ motes banked and none lost. 
---
Try doing this on a game that isn't trash. 
---
I tried it but it just wasnt working for me. Trust did the trick however. 
---
Doubtful they’d make the annual pass free if they went F2P
---
No. Nothing replaces my baby.
---
the definition of luck\^\^
---
I would like a setting that auto dismantles blues for glimmer. You can turn it on/off depending on your LL etc
---
I understand the landmark feeling! I work full time and am planning a wedding and otherwise have a busy life, so I'm beyond stoked to have hit 574 last night! Cant wait for next reset I should be able to get above 600 and finally get me some forges!
---
I did the same. Might as well get the triumph out of the way while you’re there!
---
Why? Because you have them all and want it to be harder for people that don’t?
---
They can lower the drop rate but they should take away all exotics earned under the higher drop rate.
---
Brought to you by a nova warp warlock
---
It’s your gear, you switched to a lower piece somewhere
---
HERETIC!
---
One Eyed my guy that's so broken it has ruined PvP the arc recharge one is ALMOST as bad
---
What
---
The only drop of the shader I got is my curated Threat Level and I can’t make myself push the button :(
---
atheon
---
The tower ya mean ;)
---
How did you do this??????
---
r/woooosh
---
ah fuck me, I'm an idiot
---
Dust rock is the kinetic shotgun, you might be thinking of the badlander, ikelos or retold
---
It happens mate 😂 but that is some next level harassment 
---
Man I love fireteam fondler as well
---
I do that but with thundercrash
---
And here I am getting 3 shotguns that I didn't need this week.
---
Congrats buddy. Thanks for sticking by the game too 😀
---
I ended up starting to like crucible after completing that part of the quest in a few games
---
Lol same 😂 
---
Yo the other day I had every guaridan I could find in a conga line playing follow the leader around the entire tower good I wish I had recorded it 
---
ouch
---
It's all fun and games til your GPU goes nuclear
---
Yes and raid weapons. It drops from the Bergusia forge and you turn them into Ada for the mod. 
---
You are insane
---
It's all fun and games until you don't realize what's going on and you freak out and you get sniped immediately 
---
4 damage push/shield slam into BOOM MOTHERFUCKING 85K 3 HEALTH BAR ASSRAPE WALL FOR A 1 SHOT
---
You are not worthy yet
---
There’s two in thieves landing
---
SCP-106 has breached containment
---
I think it just uses the same matchmaking system as it's in strikes, which puts ylu to the striki solo and you can start doing it while others can join.  
---
But yeah, it does not work for the forges.  
---
  
---
If you are on PC and have issues finding the groups for the forges (or any other activites), just join Destiny Discord.
---
I actually just don't like the concept behind them. Impenetrable shield created from some lowbie?
---
Damaging anything under the goblin's shield should do damage to the goblin.
---
That's _really_ well done!!
---
Cleared up some confusion, very clear and to the point. Thanks for the info!
---
This happens to me at Bergusia more than I would like. The other forges are mostly doable, but I'm not sure Bergusia is even possible solo (definitely isn't for me)
---
I'd recomend Orpheus Rig, Celestial Nighthawk, and Raiden flux for PvE 
---
Was such a fun meta honestly
---
I'm an average at best crucible player and i had the headshots done in 3 matches. With decent aim and the recoil of the gun it makes headshots easy.
---
Plenty of ppl use the Destiny 2 Companion app to find others to play with, you should use it it's a good app. As well as r/fireteams
---
This is from that pokemon zelda post, please credit it!
---
I had 12 motes the other day and all 3 of my teammates had 0. Invader arrives and all 3 of them go hide in spawn. 
---
Very much so. You can search for similar posts and there is usually at least 1 person saying crimson is best bet. Iirc it's still a "3 tap" hand cannon if you hit mainly chest/headshots. With decent aim the recoil of the gun takes care of the rest. Its a pulse rifle labeled as a hand cannon
---
Has to be on same char. I'm sure checkpoints count since it did for soloing but if you swapped, that's what did it. 
---
Wait for weekly reset, and don’t have any frames from the previous week
---
Congrats bro im proud 
---
I was thinking about adding Dust Rock Blues and Trust lol
---
Get black spindle sleeper sim those are two of the best and most needed heavy weaponsc plus ikelos shotgun 
---
How hard is the grind in this game? I start the semester this week so would it be too much of a grind for a school semester? Never touched this game because of destiny 1 but now that activision is leaving I kind of want to play and be ready for the future of the game. Is everything liked behind money?
---
Sentinel Titans running top tree get over shields on melee kills, too. Literally every Titan player has access to this and has since day 1. Nobody complains about that, though?
---
People on this sub lately seemingly love to hate on this thing but I've been killed through walls by Nova Warp and Blade Barrage. Titan supers are horrible and this exotic isn't actually that good if you're not good enough to get the kills to begin with.
---
I welcome your downvotes.
---
Sincerely,

How was it figured out that the Ed’s was in Germany?
---
Eliksni 
---
When that happened to me for the first time I lost my shit.
---
How hard is the grind? I start my semester this week and since it’s engineering I don’t have much. Time. Maybe a couple hours a week. Is the grind too much that it’s not worth the effort?
---
Space Goblin
---
My group refers to this as “docking”
---
Gofannon Servitor and mother
---
Yooooo that shit is cheating
---
You're right, but from my own experience and my own opinion, i think it'll be trash and Luna's/Not Forgotten will still be dominant and TLW won't have fixed shotgun rushihg.
---
I’m on Xbox One (GT: crash221)
---
I’ll probably jump on in a couple of of hours (Pacific Time) - that’s be great if we’re on the same system!
---
Very nice edit, also love the use of TK clips 
---
Yeah if you replace the mods one way or another it’s fine. 
---
But also I’m wondering, Did they fix the bug with Rivens curse? Someone tested it way back and said Rivens curse gives you a damage bonus but the increase in damage against you didn’t actually cause a noticeable difference. 
---
Congrats!
---
I wish Bungie would make it to where if two taken goblins did this that it would cause some kind of explosion. It would be hilarious watching. Kind of like putting the barrels of two guns pointing directly at each other and then squeezing both triggers at the same time.
---
I'm doing the headshots step right now
---
Rip
---
Lol, that's cute. If he was a top tree sentinal he couldn't have shoulder charged me. 
---
a few times for me they’ve made each other immune and we failed the forge
---
🔥🔥🔥🔥
---
Yes. That's where I got both of mine. 
---
Haha, right you are.
---
It's what he deserves for always giving me smuggler's word
---
That is one sweet shader, what's the name ? 
---
Yeah but then you have to use skyburners oath instead of a good weapon
---
I had to check the guys GT to make sure it wasn't me
---
Ah yeah.  Doing mine now
---
Bug in the system  (ironic)
---
It’s grindy, but the grind is fun. You can only buy cosmetics.
---
My goodness wish I could make it there. Is it only once?
---
I'm gonna get downvoted for this but that is such bullshit. 
---
Oh look, a crossover of my 3 favorite game series. 
---
Will. I'm going to tell my experience and you judge for your self. Year 1 was so boring. Not a lot of things that you could do, and everything is easy. But in year 2 things have changed. I like the new raids, the activity and grind. Once you get something that you want, it will feel like an award. Something that you really work hard for. It took me 4 months to get the 1k and after it felt so good. very long looting is actually fun now, and I am enjoying it.
---
Im not saying that at all...Where are you getting this misinformation from? Do you understand what it means to buy something ala-carte rather than the entire set? Expansions dont equal annual passes/season passes. Annual pass/season passes are just meant to be a deal to give the expansions to players as a FULL SET not individually. This annual pass crap is forcing people who preferred ala-carte style dlcs to buy the annual pass for content that is half complete and with less content. I'm not paying 35$ for something that has less content than what we originally had delivered for expansion drops of the same caliber.
---
Because I didn't know it was called Lost Prophecy (:
---
The $40 version does not cover the annual pass, but everything else was right.
---
Calls game trash yet browses the meme subreddit for the same game 🤔🤔🤔
---
True, can you get kill clip as a roll on this hand cannon instead?
---
Brother vance has these things called lost verses, they're guns that have vex design on them. Hand cannon, pulse rifle, sword, auto rifle, scout, smg. Creating a certain amount of each gives you a quest and you're rewarded with a shotgun from a legendary titan. Unfortunately, they're not in year 2's power range, let's say you're at 560 rn, building them would only put them at 340 at best if I remember correctly
---
I think aim assist on PC translated to "Bullet magnetism." Itll give you more leeway if you slightly miss a shot. 
---
I could be wrong. It's kind of hard to tell how potent the effect is. 
---
But she's like a butthead bro 
---
I've played this game pretty much solo too, best thing to do is do as many powerful gear quests as you can. If you have the annual pass it should tell you how to start the black armory quest (I'd get to at least 600 tho before trying to do any forges.) Also the sleeper simulant quest is grindy and boring but it's a great gun. Hope this helps. 
---
*not a meme*
---
Hunters
---
Well the OP hasn't finished the triumph where you complete shattered throne with a full set of unpurified set of reverie aka the reverie dawn gear CAN'T have a transcendent blessing, but they can have any other mod. I did it with my cloak having taken barrier and it counted so easy peazy.
---
As to the effects of rivens curse versus transcendent blessing,  (each) Rivens curse gives you +5% damage buff in the dreaming city but also you take 5% more damage per curse mod. Trans Bless removes the 5% damage your guardian takes (bringing you back to base damage resist aka purifies your armor) but keeps the 5% damage buff.
---
Yeah it’s supposed to be a Sheikah Pokeball 
---
 I'm on pc. Sorry
---
New monarchy diamonds
---
I'm on pc. Sorry
---
***Congratulations***
---
^I^H^a^t^e^y^o^u
---
I got mine this reset. So glad to know I'm not the only one who's been putting it off xD Now just to grind Breakneck
---
Only cuz I'm on the menu, I'm game I average about 30 to 35
---
Not sure about my favorite, but titan is definitely my least favorite. I hate the closed feeling you get in places like the arcology and sirens the sinking docks.
---
Lol yes
---
Owowiisooekdj FORTNITE
---
If you didn't figure it out the harsh way already, I did. Nope, raid armor doesn't work. 
---
So weapon stats affect damage in multiplayer?
---
Yup, [https://i.imgur.com/otJdJcQ.png](https://i.imgur.com/otJdJcQ.png) (this would be god-roll if it has a different masterwork)
---
#SUPERHERO LANDING. 
---
I've been helping one of my clan members all week to get his shotgun. 3+ hours every day and still nothing. Good luck op!
---
Cry some more, bitch
---
Omg people on reddit are so jaded lol don’t even comment if you’re gonna say shit like this
---
Agreed. I swap armor so much I would need an extra 400 enhancement cores to always wear masterworked armor
---
You mean power levels? Only in some modes, like iron banner and gambit. In the rest of pvp, everyone is set to the same level
---
I got shotgun on my first try last night. Good luck guardian 
---
I do this all the time to get a better angle on the enemies! Unfortunately, the jump + super muscle memory messes me up when fighting the dogs in Leviathan, since if you are too far off the ground you do not get the empowering spores damage buff. 
---
I appreciate the input. I think everyone's missing the point of my post. I don't give a fak. i just wanna know the fastest most efficient way to get Izanami's Burden
---
To make you ACTUALLY feel better, back in warmind, we ran hundreds and hundreds of EP’s just trying to get everyone through for their weapons. Some people needed literally 100+ before a drop.
---
I had well over 300 at one point in time. I farmed the weapons before the drop protection. Took 86 runs just for my shotgun.
---
I forsee cheaper DLC
---
Yeah kill clip is OP, well at-least I have like the second best roll lol.
---
Sadly, I dismantled mine for a Main Ingredient with Rampage and a charge speed Masterwork. 
---
Loaded Question is okay, but I almost never got to use that explosive 1st shot enough to make it better than Rampage. 
---
I use it sometimes, didn't have it equipped cuz I had my 650 power thunderlord on my titan
---
Fbm
---
#fAiR AnD bAlAnCeD 
---
 The grind was real and long, but i finally hit 650! The weekly reset only goes so far, and only playing with one character is hard to level up if you don't do raids so being able to say that i hit the max light just by playing the game i actually enjoy playing is something i have been waiting for. The hype for me is real so sorry for that, but thank you Bungie for making a games worth loosing yourself in. It's an amazing feeling! 
---
I'm on pc. Sorry bro
---
Same.. dont know why Im not getting those blossoms
---
Sorry bro, I'm on pc
---
Only by name
---
Thanks :). I have the catalyst but I never used it. I'm gonna try it.
---
This isn't an LFG sub.
---
Rule 13.
---
Check our LFG thread on the sidebar, and also the Team-up Tuesday megathread on /r/DestinyTheGame. 
---
No BA is not good. It's only worth it to grind godrolls in forge and get machine guns. I could be talked into chasing izanagis. I think moving away from story campaigns is a good thing since most aren't here for that and it takes a ton of effort to get played for 2 hours, once.
---
Sorry 
---
If you're on PSN hit me up. I have a few buddies that would be down.
---
PSN:. SkullOfRoses
---
Havent they even said something like this?
---
Laughs in 256 shaders and no shotgun
---
To be fair it was my second chest, but I had two keys
---
Less lock away and more tomb. He killed enough Vex that they turned him into a monument.
---
But Saint-14 is Dead, so we have Shaxx.
---
Don't give up guardian!
---
Dangerously logical, Guardian.
---
Figured as much. The triump didn’t reset so I had hope lol
---
Good, no epic games launcher 
---
How do I do that?
---
Lol sorry dude the editing software I’m using at the moment does not allow to get any higher. Hopefully change that soon but still thank u for at least watching what ever you did. Appreciate it. 👍🏽
---
Just make a post on r/DestinyFashion
---
Riding the bullet train like:
---
Make sure you get the hidden chests for the exotic ship first before charging up the catalyst. Saves you time to do them at the same time. 
---
haha that's how I felt when I got mine like a week ago. It dropped with enhanced hand cannon targeting :D
---
Go aquire The Perfect Paradox or just go read it's lore. He's only dead in this time. Yet he may appear later.
---
No it's not perfect, that's the point, the constant power shift to different loadouts keeps it dynamic, fresh, and fun. OEM requires you to win the 1v1 fight you are engaged in to get an over shield, yes it's powerful, but you seem to have forgotten Hunters with Wormhust, when you could have them to 1% HP, they Dodge, not only break aim assist on consoles so you have to reaquire the target, but then come out of the Dodge with basically full health and regeneration proced, that was an even worse exotic that put the odds of winning a 1v1 highly in the hunters favor no matter their skill since the other target now had to do all his damage over again with whatever low health he has putting him at a great disadvantage. With OEM just because he is wearing it does not give that same level of advantage. Spectacular Hunter can have entire map wallhacks with invisibility yet a Titan with a tiny over shield and only 1 wallhack on a single target that chose stupidly to engage him at the wrong time then flee when they should learn to pick their fights better, learn when to attack your target, yet OEM is more powerful? Both require a kill to get the benefits, yet single target wallhack and over shield is the most OP thing in D2 ever yet entire map wallhacks with invisibility or insta-health + regen + aim assist breaking hunters or gwisin vest 5 minute supers are nowhere near that? There is always something better and it will be nerfed like always which is what's supposed to happen in D2, and in turn something else will replace it, then you will be here again saying nerf. How about instead go out there and take the opportunity to better yourself as a player by forming new tactics to counter it, use the opportunity to improve your skills by facing a challenging opponent, it's like with Last Wish or SOTP, 19 hours they spent on Last Wish, under leveled up against skulls, did they say nerf? No, they overcame the seemingly impossible activity, becoming better players and having fun while doing it. Games that don't challenge you don't keep your interest, they aren't fun, and in the end that's the goal, to have fun, face the challenging opponents with OEM, adapt to the enemy and kill them, it's more fun than spending every day saying nerf!
---
Slide to the side of them and they wont hit you. Super easy in gambit cause all it takes is to shotty hits and they're dead
---
F
---
Been here since the start. Not sure why I'm surprised anymore 
---
Okay, this is epic
---
&gt; For my energy, i use Riskrunner
---
I dont understand, is that particular weapon gets super good when its masterworked? I've tried to use it and i just struggle unless im against vex. 
---
And i agree they absolutely should be very atrong, but right now theyre far too good. Queen breaker being the main offender honestly. That charge time and ludicrous aim assist is just too much. But i do absolutely agree they need to be strong as theyre power weapons. Maybe just not thus strong lol 
---
/r/DestinySherpa 
---
Gambit leather, for weapons, gunmetal and wood is all I need. Same could be said about gambit Chrome, for the silver and ivory.
---
Ace can actually beat NF/Compete with it very well if you’re good with it. I’m not unfortunately so I’ve stayed w Trust for most of comp and it feels similar to Luna’s. Lunas doesn’t make you instantly a god or anything tho so while it feels good to get I still need to practice with it to get the full use :)
---
Excuse me
---
I just ran it twice, only took like 49 minutes at the most
---
But ice breaker was the og sniper
---
Yes up until about 1200
---
How’s the grind to 600?
---
Hopefully 😁
---
Can't remember the channel that did it, but they used to do that back in D1
---
Good to know. What is it this week?
---
Thats awesome
---
**Buying one from Xur used to count. It no longer does. Neither do the Leviathan underbelly chests!**
---
Your only hope is to get a random exotic engram dropped from an enemy on the ground, or to get a catalyst. If the engram goes to your postmaster, it does not count. 
---
That no longer works for the quest, for some reason. 
---
Shotgun
---
Tower fuckery is the best part of destiny. We once had a 10+ guardian game of leapfrog going. It was the greatest achievement of my life. At least that's what I tell my children. 
---
Depending on perks and what you use your Hammerhead for then yes put a Boss Spec on it.  If you have a Hammerhead with Surrounded try putting a Surrounded spec on it.  I know there's some RNG to getting a Surrounded Spec so while you attempt to aqquire one you could use a Boss Spec.  
---
Congrats, guardian! 
---
Most people prefer as much recovery as you can get. Faster health recovery is always a good thing. 
---
I gotta try that out
---
yeah, there was one time i traded a nighthawk goldie bullet with a guy invading with queenbreaker... 
---
AND I NEVER REGRETTED 
---
That sounds awesome I'm going to look it up. I'm absolutely willing to learn I've just never played with anyone (in a raid) willing to teach or at a minimum use a mic.
---
I used a few, my suggestions;
---
-Vendor Bygones (Drifter sells w/ Full Auto and Kill Clip)
---
-Chattering Bone
---
-Blast Furnace
---
-Ace of Spaces
---
-Trust
---
-Dust Rock Blues
---
-The Chaperone
---
-Mindbenders Ambition
---
-Good Bone Structure (Slug Shottie) throw an Icarus mod on it and it’s even better
---
-Tractor Cannon (can one shot people out of their super)
---
I stuck with most of these except for Mindbenders bc I don’t have it. If you can learn to use some of these weapons in synergy with your favorite subclass I’m sure you’ll notice a small difference at least :)
---
Frik
---
me too
---
I had thought the same thing until I joined a team. You just have to be consistent and you will improve, teamwork and communication is the biggest factor in getting the weapon :)
---
Do the levuathan raids/lairs. They will drop exotics that are not autodecrypted.
---
I’d say NF is a “sweat” grind. Luna’s isn’t as hard as people think but it is definitely a grind and you need to be prepared for that
---
It’s called Dawning Hope 😁 
---
P.S. It makes all your guns look like that!
---
the facts are all out , you just ignore them.
---
\-Game got sold for less than 10$ couple of times and gave it for free at some point \[Fact\]
---
\-Activision didnt really fight for the game rights and there was no drama \[Fact\] , do you really think that if the game was profitable they would let bungie go away freely?
---
"base game isnt worth anything down the line" is this facts or your opinion? the hypocrisy is making you look so stupid.
---
call of duty is underperforming if you compare it to the COD last games (the game still makes tons of money and set some sale records compared to other games and its a fact)
---
destiny is overall underperforming compared to other games and the goal that activision set.
---
yeah sure there is nothing wrong with content creators (some of them got most of their fans from specific game and were dedicated to that game) that move to another games.. (after initial sponsored stream/content) you need to ask yourself why does it happen and why wont the audience of this content creator move to the game either (beause they will)
---
and I know you will probably say "but why dont just play both", many people dont have much time and they prefer 1 main game (especially in this genre) and even if you play couple of games there will be always a game that is better and you will play more, if anthem will be that game, many people will move to it and there will be less players in destiny (did I mention that when anthem start kicking with the free updates , destiny2 will look even worse?)
---
The game isnt good and it just going to get worse as I said.
---
you think everything is good? Keep telling yourself that bud. 
---
I will remember that and will let you know how right you were . remindme! 40 days
