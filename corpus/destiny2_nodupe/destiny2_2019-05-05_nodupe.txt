It looks like your dick

---
---
So amazing and glorious?
---
Its fucking amazing. If i get a pc this is def gunna be my permanent wallpaper
---
Also, is this SFM?
---
Added Mobs To The Fight.
---

---
Aka shit that spawns to distract you from the boss.
---
Helped my brother beat Leviathan Normal for the first time, only took 2 hours and it was a blast. I want to try Last Wish and Scourge but we’ll see!
---
And that's why I will never try Petra's Run.
---
I always thought it was because the weak red-bar hive enemies are called Adcolytes and ads sounds catchy
---
How is the quality of these? I've been wanting to get some stuff from the Destiny store (Mostly the Thorn hoodie) but if these are nice and sturdy feeling then I think that they'll make some cool ornaments to hang around the house.
---
I highly recommend getting them! To be honest, they are a little bit smaller than I originally expected, but they’re still super cool! The quality is amazing. It’s legit metal, doesn’t feel cheap in any form whatsoever. Plus you get a cool little congratulatory card that goes with it.
---
Bergusia is unlocked for everyone it's at the very bottom of the edz
---
Make sure you have at least two warlocks. One with well and phoenix protocol and the other nova with skull. All 4 use wardcliff (arc burn this week). Once in the final boss room let the well warlock switch to lunafaction boots and the knights are dead before you know it. Ohh and use taken armaments mod to have full heavy all the time.
---
end your enemies rightly by throwing the cylinders at them!
---
F
---
But they're not called Adcolytes, they're Acolytes.
---
Right now there's no balance as someone else said. Hand cannons and grenades with Revelry going on until Tuesday. Hand cannons like Thorn are meta, not forgotten and Luna are getting nerfs, but some people are switching to Service Revolver (and rightfully so, it's a great gun).
---
Overall it's super sweaty and if you don't use meta, you're gonna have a bad time.
---
But seriously probably loose the blade
---
So forsaken started with the launch of season 4. the annual pass adds DLC content for season 5, 6 and 7. Think of them as mini-DLCs. They add new activities (black armory forges / scourge of the past raid in S5, reckoning / gambit prime in the current season [s6] and at least a new raid next season), but don’t add new story missions or main content arcs. They bring new exotics, guns, armor, and power levels to chase but that’s about it. Every season, they also add new content for non-annual pss owners, but it is very minimal in scale.for the most part, you’ll only get new eververse content and a few seasonal events, but probably enough for a casual player.
---
I play Destiny religiously, and have since D1Y1. I never understood the point of playing an online game without buying the dlc, but to each their own. Good luck
---
Wow. What exactly is revelry?
---
Looks like it’s worse than DARCI
---
Pretty sure they made it so all the bows can random rolls.
---
I put on a grenade tonic, forget I have it, and just throw swarms defensively. What's really fun is way of a thousand cuts with melee recharge.
---
Just more damage is fine. Adaptive 390 rpm do 31/20 (head/body) and High Impact 340 rpm do, literally, 32-and-a-bit/20. It's pathetic.
---
35/23 would make them way more viable but still demanding.
---
Code works great, thanks for this!
---
Like a spring event. They been doing seasonal events with boosts and rewards. The big thing now is people are choosing grenade boost that means you can basically spam them. Smart players are avoiding the Crucible, but it should return to somewhat normal by Tuesday reset.
---
Pretty sure base game is disc only at this point. Think you gotta get Base+Forsaken to get a digital copy
---
People like you are why I'm glad I went with Business Class internet with DDoS protection.

---
As a hunter, this hits too close to home 😂
---
Ive been using a pretty nasty Le Monarque + Duke MK. 44 with opening shot rampage, and its pretty insane for mid game. May give crimson a chance though!
---
No. I have midnight coup and I've never even playef a prestige raid
---
What a fucking joke
---
Did you finish the catalyst?
---
Yes.
---
What did it cost.
---
20+ hours of my life.
---
Either Malachite Gold or Verdant Crown
---
I love you. Handheld super Nova bait.
---
I love you both
---
F for hunters only have 6 usable supers
---
I do the exact opposite of this.
---
What about my trash?
---
I got an 11 streak with it once. That map on nessus where B has that lane to the middle of the map. It was like shooting fish in a barrel. Never could duplicate that again though.
---
The last trash. Yours, not mine.
---
I play on Xbox, but I'm in the good Ol' U S of A
---
the warlock's class armor is like be karmen rider 's belt
---
Yo, I found the snitch guys.
---
This shit always happens to me
---
Yeah I just exit and do it again but its still infuriating
---
Do you not read prior text. I haven’t been able to
---
LOL that’s literally not possible. Their helmets pop off once they get below a threshold on their health bar. It’s like a Phase 2. There’s no way to not pop off the helmets if you want to kill them.
---
It’s considered bad because bloom lowers the skill ceiling. Also D2 is a FPS where imo you have a much more direct connection to the aim and physicality of your character compared to other games that use bloom (ex. Fortnite) so it feels off to have that randomness.
---
The recoil based spread you notice on PC is different from bloom, since it’s a consistent pattern specific to the type of gun. This is similar to the recoil patterns in CS and can be controlled/mitigated with careful aiming. The same cannot be done with bloom due to the random element.
---
Hey great work! If you're looking for feedback, I'd add a bunch more grass variety, maybe a slightly more bare spot, a few foreground elements (a path, a boulder, bushes, etc) and some background things for depth like trees and mountains far off in the distance. I'd also light from a lower angle for some drama. Great job though.
---
It's a incredibly simple questline. It used to be meta all across, doesn't seem to be anywhere near it anymore.
---
Lol. Kickerswotches perform a remote router reset....you...cant counter that bud. Lol. 
---
I don't use these things. But its fun to talk about.
---
..nothing protects against a kickerswitch bud. It basically remotely resets your router.  I don't one unleas i need to reset one of my routers remotely, buuuut...
---
K thanks
---
How did you send that?
---
Also. Knowing how to do something doesnt mean i do. Lol. I don't do any of that stuff normally.
---
Reload speed cap OP
---
You're trash , Brock.
---
Did you put the trash out though?
---
I mean ye was nice enough to remind you..
---
I almost have dredgen, and im 100% buying this. How much did they cost?
---
Why is he so interested in your trash?
---
Yeah that must have been me, it usually takes me 3 or 4 times for me to get off that tower
---
You don't really get what nerf means, right?
---
Congrats man, they are my main motivation for chasing those titles right now, but they look awesome
---
I broke pencils repeatedly sharpening them. I rememer using knives to sharpen too and they are just so brittle. The skill this took is absolutely mind boggling!
---
For instance, code of the missile for titans has a perk called Inertia Override. When you slide into ammo, it increases your weapon damage and reloads your weapon. If you couple this with a shotgun or fusion rifle you’ll do insane amounts of damage.
---
I think you get 60 but I might be wrong, I din't play comp'
---
Definitely worth it.
---
It doubled with this seasom you win double you loos double also counts for playing/not playing enough for a week
---
You get 120 points 
---
I feel bad for you
---
Thx
---
Same. My fellow clan leader was raving about it to me and so I grinded it over a weekend last year and now I'm a JR apologist 😂
---
thanks :D I guess ill probably get it soon since its not too expensive.
---
What shader is that?
---
I guess she has the same type of health system as Shuro Chi, then
---
Ok
---
Supremacy is the best kinetic sniper in the PvP meta right now, it can have quickdraw also
---
Are the guns a different power on console? I've heard they handle differently and that can be frustrating. I wouldn't see a problem with extra recoil on PC, most guns, even SMGs are super easy to handle even with low handling and stability imho.
---
I read exactly what you wrote. Your quest progressed, right?
---
Take my damn upvote, and then probably see me trying to achieve the same thing cos dang I’m impressed.
---
Don't bother with PvP.
---
Yes it did, but it didn't like it should. Strangerstill  wrote that at the end there is abomination that spawns but i killed it on the complete other side of the map.
---
ye if you play against bots it does.
---
I’d say absolutely, if you enjoy the core mechanics. Plus playing it on PC is a dream, it looks great and plays even better. It’ll take time to get exotics but they aren’t everything and you can still get by without them.
---
If I didn't already own annual pass , I would just go a head and wait for d3. Or not play all together
---
60 less rpm, so a 30% rof decrease for a 100% damage increase per shot
---
I'm assuming that you have the pass because of being 640. So I suggest working on forge weapons and going from there. I haven't done much with drifter because I don't have time to, but you should work on the many exotics that have been released. My personal favorite is Jötuun but there are many with great potential.
---
Really? I just felt like playing cause i got reminded how fun IT is to use a hand cannon 😃
---
If you're having and off day with JR, switch the loadout to  Polaris Lance with either a subby kinetic or service revolver. JR and PL have a similar but distinct feel to them so the minor change helps get back on a roll again.
---
that armour looks fresh
---
Im playing on ps4 as we speak... Running around nessus doing drang
---
Depends on who you ask, but in my opinion yes it is good.
---
i see only this,

is this normal?

It’s an ornament for the stag from a previous season.

Oh ok

That actually sounds sweet

oof
---
The problem with D2 is that I play alone (PC player) I do not play raids and the D2 farm is often unnecessarily long (improvement stones ...), Anthem is cheaper and I will play something else
---
Smells like console
---
Depends what it is?

PC

Op literally the reason they wiped.

I can really feel the love radiating from whoever was thinking of the UX when deciding how button prompts should work in this game.

Graviton Lance and my power level is 206
---
Watched this again. You have two primary weapons, used no super, no grenade spam revelry, and had no heavy. I would ask if you were new but you have orchid. So what gives?
---
For a solo player I would actually say the annual pass is bad. A lot of the best parts of the annual pass will require you to fireteam up, with a good chunk of them requiring you to lfg a fireteam since as you stated in the comments you're on PC. We're kind of dead for forges and for t1 reckonings. You usually can only get a full fireteam for a t3 reckoning if the modifiers are really good as well lately. A lot of what gets done on PC right now is clan dependent and our LFG is the slowest it's been in all of year 2 right now. 
---
tl;dr: If you want to find a clan and get the annual pass then go for it, but as a solo player I don't think you would have fun with it.
---
Dude. All the sweaties left pvp for the revalry event. Get to above 1980 glory this week, or it is about to get 20 times harder after reser

---
I use dim its easier for me. so i just looked through my entire collection and the closest i can see would be frostveil boots. i didn't keep a pair so i can't confirm or deny that they bend and look like that. they could be the skerren corvus boots i dont have them so i can't say for sure. other than that the closet i have is the great hunt but they have the knife on the side like you said.
---
You have to play a lot more than 3 matches, unless you're a God and never lose. Even then, unlikely.
---
Basically, if you're asking if you can get a pinnacle weapon by doing the bare minimum, you shouldn't be thinking about pinnacle weapons on the first place.

**This applies to mugs/posters/etc...**

This listing was created today, almost certainly in response to this post. There are lots of people who trawl reddit for popular posts of graphics and funny shirts. They upload low resolution images found on google or even cut and pasted from the reddit post’s photo, onto garment preview images.  
---
The broken English nonsense description is also a red flag (even though it’s inadvertantly hilarious). When you buy the shirt, if you actually receive it you will very likely receive a shit quality shirt with a fuzzy blurry print.

I’ve loved abusing revelry buffs in gambit (melee buff + Sunbracers is OP plz nerf), I like the idea of making it a special, once-a-year thing. It’s the kid of fun that’s getting dangerously close to getting super old.
---
Hitting cross map crits of 202 and just feeling like a king. During the thorn meta phase I was the only person rocking hawkmoon every game and topping the board for doing so. Loved handcannons in D1 just we’re so smooth
---
This is still possible this just happened on accident right now against some clan mates at 5500 level.
---
I would prefer just handling increased to max catalyst with fanfare having increased benefits.
---
Weapons drop from tier 2 &amp; 3. There is no guarantee besides the bounty for armor pieces. Just grind it out. But the armor pieces for the collection badge only matter if they are Notorious pieces.
---
That looks pretty fun to mess around with.
---
You might have wiped me and my team actually we did get yeeted by one explosion from the Polaris Lance
---
Guns randomly drop when you defeat the bosses. The chances are pretty low, and the weapons available depend on the boss. The tier 2 and tier 3 bosses are the same, but alternate week to week. 
---
You can wager motes of any strength. When you go to make a mote, you should see that there is an option to make both a weak and middling mote. 
---
There is no reason to make lower tier motes.
---
WHATTT that armor was loved by like literally everyone when taken king first dropped.
---
Ya ive been doing tier 2...so both weapons and armour are rng....do i need to wager a mote for the weapons or is that only for armour? Reason being Im out of synths..
---
Reminds me of [The 4 chords for any song](https://youtu.be/oOlDewpCfZQ)
---
A buddy of mine is mildly talented in the guitar (good, but by no means great) and always busts out the 4 chords and gets people to to rap any of their favorite hip hop songs.  Definitely a panty dropping party trick. 
---
Bastard.
---
Weapons drop just from completing the run. The motes only drop armor.
---
