I'll be using it in Iron Banner all week üòÜü§£
---
---
---
True, the triumph armor would've been a perfect model. 
---
Warlock Armor ftw üòèüòå
---
Secret is out boys
---
Gotta attach a meme to it LOL
---
When you use it you can see it has flaws. Slow charge rate. Hard to hit moving enemies. If you know how to counter it is really easy to avoid.
---
I still dream or that racing scarf for my hunter
---
Saint 14 would be proud of you Guardian!
---
This is beautiful, so simple yet massive 
---
I said they should, not that they are.
---
With warlocks, just get bottom tree dawnblade, top tree nova bomb with the ‚Äúskull
---
Of dire ahamkara‚Äù exotic helmet. Those two things are so much fun to play, and you‚Äôll see why when using them.
---
With warlocks, skull of dire Ahamkara, is all I have to say...
---
Holy damn ok 1. Down right amazing fan art and 2. You are a true destiny fan if you can draw this amazing 
---
but you didn't
---

---
you just switched the subject.
---
he was talking about ways to evade Jotunn and you started talking about supers
---
next time before you post something after getting destroyed at comp or gambit take a few mins and relax
---
Thats Why am fine with spectral without gwin. Being a strpng super is fine. The issue is how to nerf gwin but keep it being useful.
---
I agree no super should be useable in a game about space warriors with super powers
---
Same here bro grinded since December and finally got tlord this weekend from a powerful engram milestone 
---
Hammer.exe has stopped working 
---
Even his license plate is exotic
---
# I know that‚Äôs you Dredgen Yor
---
All jokes aside you are an extremely talented artist, nice drawing
---
As Asher would say, ‚ÄúTYPICAL TITAN IDIOCY!‚Äù
---
Holy shit you did amazing I thought it was from the game but hell no I was so damn wrong I‚Äôd LOVE to see the rest
---
reality is often disappointing.
---
That is absolutely amazing
---
*hacks into Bungie‚Äôs matchmaking system* but now, reality can be whatever I want.

Yikes. Is there any word from bungie about a fix anytime soon?
---
Dude ....... Yes ...... Why!?!
---
That‚Äôs some quality work right there. Very nice guardian.
---
This isn‚Äôt the sub for this and even if it was you didn‚Äôt even list what platform your on
---
But each character has a seperate postmaster... =)
---
Wrong subreddit buddy. Try r/fireteams 
---
I can't stand control, and clash does not feel as well suited either. I am for this.
---
Ah yes, the two hunter vanguards: Clyde-6 and Cause-6
---
You need more upvotes.  This is my second post on the this Reddit space and I'm honestly disgusted by this image.  
---
Seriously, WTF.
---
the whole point of this exotic is to make the super better
---
just like any other super exotic.
---
Shards of Galanor now refills 75% of the super energy instead of 90% while the Nova bomb helmet refills the whole bar.
---
maybe fix that first?
---
you have a super that lasts longer than SB with the vest without even needing anything with it, fix that maybe.
---
i truly belive that all this crying about SB is just because one of the most popular gun quests requires void kills and the only efficient void super for hunters is SB. 
---
and also we have like only 3 useable supers in PvP. That includes Blade Barrage, Golden Gun and Spectral.
---
the Arc Staff is shit tbf: it lasts like 4 miliseconds, people see you from the other side of the map and the only useful thing in this super is that it deflects bullets (while burning the super energy like leaves on gasoline)
---
I rarely even saw someone use it outside PvE before the Thorn quest. 
---
If I even saw anyone use it at all in PvE.
---
I almost never see anyone with thorn that also plays with SB.
---
wait a month and see everyone who gets thorn shut up about Spectral Blades
---
Reminds me of Drustvar from wow. very nice
---
you spelled Snitch wrong 
---
No roaming supers would be a pretty sweet meta tbh.
---
The warlock should be a servitor, the titans should be a captain, hunters should be vandals 
---
Guardian themed guardian 
---
I can handle one jotunn spamming scrub but when it's like two or three guys it get's old really fast.
---
ooF
---
But what about my last word :(
---
I do enjoy any hand cannon, Breakneck (or pulse rifle for dealing with the snipers) and J√∂tunn (way more range than Ikelos-SG or other shotguns), and for the power weapon something the weekly elemental singe (usually machine guns because they are still the most flexible).
---
As it being the only weapon i used after getting it in d1 i give this a 10/10
---
The only armor i have wanted is fallen armor...
---
nothing that good today. Starting to get my Nascent Dawn stuff done. The scout rifle is pretty fun
---
Spectral blades is overpowered. It needs a nerf. 
---
Thanks!
---
no, people have been complaining for a long time. their 'solution' was to double the points won and lost. just makes it easier for sweaties to get to the top while not making much of a difference to people who can't get a streak going. 
---
For real
---
I specifically play way of the current to duel and destroy spectral, and because I use raiden flux I normally have enough super left to kill 2-3 more enemies in comp 
---
I finally got around to grinding EP last week to get the shotty, and it‚Äôs definitely worth it. As a solo player, I had actually never even completed EP past the second wave until last week.
---
Finding people running EP, in my experience, isn‚Äôt too difficult as a solo player without setting up something on LFG somewhere. I found success in just hopping on the sparrow and riding back and forth between the two regions until I saw EP starting up. If I didn‚Äôt run into one after 2-3 round trips, I‚Äôd just fast travel to one of the spawn points to reload into the world.
---
Now, maybe 1 out of everyone 3-5 times I‚Äôd run into an EP being started, there either are a) not enough people or b) the people running it suck (like literally doing nothing about the shadowrifts???) and you won‚Äôt get past the 2nd wave. Just move on if that‚Äôs the case. Because, when you do find a decent group and get to level 6 &amp; 7, in my experience, it‚Äôs common to be able to get in 5-8 boss kills because at that point you‚Äôve got other people that are grinding likely for the shotty, and more people interested in dropping into the game when they see you are passed wave 3, which helps keep it going as people come and go.
---
If you‚Äôre also on PS4, I‚Äôd be more than happy to run some EP with you, as it‚Äôs actually fun if you can get to the higher levels, and I love constantly spamming tethers and the huge groups of closely grouped adds EP has makes it really easy.
---
No potato photos.
---
Direct-capture only please. 
---
I feel you on a deep level. I try to keep my hunter in fallen armor since I wish we could play as them
---
No, at least not one on hand for the full set. I do have one that shows off the warlock helmet 
---
Real nigga right there
---
Lmfao every time man
---
I really want my hunter to look like a cowboy. My D1 hunter is still wearing a vest. 
---
You know what ur getting into when u go from  4/8 guardians to 5 or 6/8. Or especially from 4/ to 8/8. If you're looking for a decent 4 stack join the destiny 2 discord server. People are always looking to fill up to the 4 stack. 
---
Helm?
---
Thank you for replying. I tried EP with my friend when he got home from school, we did wave 7 at least 5-6 times and didn‚Äôt get it. Then all of the other ppl we were doing it with, just left. So we went to play comp. Unfortunately i‚Äôm on Xbox. :( I appreciate the offer tho! I‚Äôm still trying to get it before tomorrow‚Äôs reset.
---
Also tricked
---
?
---
I've been replaying the original Halo series in preparation for MCC PC and when I saw the title I was a bit confused. Sentinels were pretty annoying in CE though...
---
This is true 
---
Laughs in blade barrage*
---
Have you gotten threat level yet?
---
Thank god someone finaly does this 
---
Look i dont need godtier precise hit box like spectral
---
But when i smack him right in the face after i cast it i want him to die 
---
But these sets are dope.
---
Uh ok
---
Regular Gambit, no. Prime, better with some clan mates, Reckoning...if you matchmake you might as well suck blow out of a hookers ass and we're a blind fold. So it is what you make of it.

No yeah you‚Äôre right on the nose for Spectral Blades. Top tree Dawnblade is pretty okay, but compared to that is pretty bad. Bottom tree though extends the super for every kill you get

just a couple months ago this sub was complaining to buff spectral blades.. they buff them like you guys asked... now look

They're friends. She's known the vanguard for awhile like since she was a kid.
---
Pretty sure that should be semi colon there
---
and they waste the heavy and super on random adds before entering the portal
---
pve or pvp?
---
Is that the melee ability from the new Warlock Arc Subclass or..?
---
I don't know. It's not as powerful as newer HCs, but I find the perks pretty interesting. Drang creates a ton of orbs and is pretty fast getting those extra damage rounds in Sturm. The biggest problem for me was Drang kicks like a horse and the fire rate abismal.
---
It's the days modifier blackout. Increased melee damage, I can survive a hit at full health but the modifier shafts me.
---
I definitely wasn‚Äôt showing it off lol 
---
huckleberry is pretty good primary to run, good for mowing down all the adds and if you have catalyst thats extra orbs for everyone.
---
It can roll with trench barrel, and does a bit more damage than ikelos because it isn't energy.
---
It still counts as a post that is about loot. We've made a weekly thread where you can post guns you've received that have bad rolls.

Alright

exp boost coins? ive been playing 3 days i have literally no idea what youre referring to haha. whats their actual name and how od i get them?
---
go to eververse and you‚Äòll see coins for around 50 bright dust. the item description tells you that it can be used to boost your and your fire teams exp gain for around 4 hours
---
as a spectral blades user i totally agree with you. it's supposed to be a sneaky ultimate, not a titan simulator

im at 698 power and im getting 674 "powerful" drops. fun game.

I now know what i want my future car to look like. I will save this pic just incase i need it. Thanks m8

If it's reddit just u/Vysoft tag me, same with twitter (@Vysoft). Anything else like YT or something just DM or reply to this again.
---
I‚Äôm 43, not raided yet due to not wanting to run with screeching kids using a acronyms I don‚Äôt understand (like KYTD, or whatever you used). Have a 3-member clan consisting of my girlfriend and son, usually playing in the same room as some wi-FI-but-lan set up.
---
So yeah, raiding would be nice. I‚Äôm TheMeekestCad. In the UK. Normally I‚Äôm on in the evenings UK time, but about to go on a meditation retreat for a couple of weeks. Hence I‚Äôm chilled and just love playing.
---
So yeah, perhaps add me on PS4. Can‚Äôt guarantee owt but you never know üôÇ
---
Ok. I don‚Äôt want to be pain in the ass, but as I mentioned in my recommendation. Is there any way you could get them on a green screen? If not, that‚Äôs fine because the footage you‚Äôve got is still good. I was just mainly requesting for it because I was planning on making a meme with drifter, and when I saw your animation I had the perfect idea.
---
Oh shit I just realized that I linked the wrong video, gimme a sec. 
---
[There you go :)](https://youtu.be/ZMKms_Vg9DY)
---
I would smash that Hunter. Sooo burlesque and sultry.
---
Thanks a lot!
---
Think it's more directed at the ones that act as if each game is a championship and play with tryhard loadouts like Dust Rock Blues, Luna's Howl or Not Forgotten, Wardcliff Coil. If you go into a match as a 6 stack running some dumb fun loadout like 6 Prometheus Lens' I think you're safe.
---
What‚Äôs wrong with using strong weapons to win the match?
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I get equally as frustrated dying to those weapons, but it doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre sweaty tryhards. Even though it‚Äôs titled Quickplay, the Crucible is still a competitive place and people want to win. 
---
I‚Äôm merely playing Devil‚Äôs Advocate here. 
---
It just bothers me that people are so quick to decide what loadouts people should and should not be using because it doesn‚Äôt adhere to their idea of fun. 
---
He's trying to mock you for running away lmfao what a loser xD I wanna see how he does in comp.
---
I love chasing enemies down and imagining how scared they are while I do it, because I know what it's like to run like hell away from multiple enemies while I'm alone and have taken damage.
---
thank you!

53rd Moon of Fundament
---
USA
---
Most activity is weeknights and all weekends
---
53rd Moon of Fundament is a 21+ Destiny clan, our average age is around 30. As being a clan for adults, we understand that life's responsibilities are first. We are looking for laid back guardians that want to complete all the weekly activities, and actively participate in endgame activities.
---
We currently have around 50 active members.
---
We are a clan that enjoys endgame content. Our members enjoy teaching the mechanics to activities to those that do not know them yet. Experience is not a requirement, you only need the willingness to learn and to give back to the clan by helping other members. Our members enjoy grinding all aspects of the game. We currently have multiple raids going each week.¬†
---
We are also looking for players that thoroughly enjoy the PvP aspect of the game as well. Our current members enjoy playing in full teams to work on communication and map awareness to better ourselves and the clan for Trials, IB and Comp. We have alot of members that have been getting into comp. and grinding for the Broadsword, Luna and NF.¬†
---
**Activity on our app is required. We depend on our app to schedule all events and it helps us maintain a close knit clan because everyone gets to know each other better. Because of the app, we are a very social clan that have open party chats almost every night for all members to join.**¬†
---
If you think our clan might be a good fit for you, please DM me and I will send a link to our app. 
---
Well, yes, I could have thrown my shield. And yes, I throw it pretty often. But if an enemy is right in front of me I am going to use the melee-attacks.
---
Drops from the barons
---
No worries, cheers
---
It happens to every Sentinel. Trust me.
---
I remember one game where enemy team had a 4 or 5 stack all running skyburners oath. I think they must have just done a leviathan raid. Scores were close until near the end when they started losing so they changed weapons and tried harder. That was really fun :D I don't remember who won lol
---
We have the ogre in that one lost sector on titan
---
They wont let you because it could diminish the user from wanting to chase exotic ornaments, not only that but I'm only gonna use this ornament because it sets the color tones and schemes better, but what do i know, exotics should be able to be made master worked unlocking orb making abilities and hey if I spent my cores to do so now I unlock the chance to apply shader instead of the random stat bump, but I'm just an end user Ha!
---
Then don‚Äôt fucking play it and gtfo
---
I did the same thing except it was in need for speed payback 
---
Nice story, kinda made my day!
---
We would be a hobgoblin... hunter are special...
---
What u saying hunters can be smart....ish
---
Dope
---
Awesone livery for an even more awesone car! 
---
Oh look another post about this issue 
---
..... this makes no sense for the below reasons:
---
1- EA owns the star wars license not respawn.
---
2- bungie had a 10 year partnership with Activision, respawn is owned by EA. 
---
3- They will make TF3 eventually mate
---
"Open wide riven!" Riven: "Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!"
---
That's a weird way to spell hunter.
---
Don't worry, if we bitch about it enough Bungie will see it and then nerf Thunderlord..  because that's what they do.
---
NANI?!
---
Is it actually lag if Eva‚Äôs oven worked without a hitch?
---
I don't mind, I already set one on auction, it's a '93 240sx SE. If it's sold out before you can grab it I'll just put another on auction. You can also download my tune for the car, the tune is called Gymkhana,  as the name suggested it's tuned for high score, high speed, and hardcore drifting.
---
If you need players to grind these activities so you can possibly win in crucible I feel for you bro
---
Update: I can sell the car with the livery to you, that's the only way for me to get the livery to you.

All D.F.A drops are curated

Wait can I farm the baron strike? God I forgot his name but he has stupid immune phases and is basically a skull warlocks wet dream.
---
 The helm has the mad monk shader. The gauntlets has no shader on. The chest have the dreaming cast shader. The legs has distant earth schader. And the bond has the metro shift schader on it. 
---
it IS much
---
Thanks, bro. I'm glad this wasn't just a 1-off like so many flavor texts.
---
Don't forget about all us warlocks too
---
Welcome to the life of an AU player
---
Comp sucks for solo-queuing in general unless you‚Äôre mildly decent at the game.
---
True
---
Better Devils/Jotunn/Hammerhead for most things, Malf/Last Man Standing/21% or Hammerhead for reckoning and sometimes I'll hot swap Malf for Wardcliff at the boss
---
Thanks, I appreciate it.
---
Air assault is cool
---
Sweaties will have low light we won‚Äôt be in IB unless that buff rumor is true. 
---
Machine guns can absolutely destroy a Sentinel with their shield up. It only takes 5 hits to completely drain their super.
---
I thought that too, but turns out it was Cayde's sparrow they were riding so who knows?
---
You have Backup Plan on your Fusion Rifle, dont you?
---
It's the year one version of erentil fr4
---
good times, sadly, I know that feeling.   I have very fond memories of playing Shattered Throne with my brothers for the first time.  Had no idea what we were doing, we got owned big time but I had a blast doing it.
---
No, they're from season 2. season 1 didn't have ornaments.
---
wait, isn't the buff for pve only? i thought it doesn't work in iron banner.
---
Am i the only one who sees musk
---
Ive already completed invader and collector.  Started on reaper a couple days ago and can already tell this will, by far, be the longest grind because of the high value targets.  Assuming you get one a game (big assumption), still gonna take at least 50 games.  Ive cleaned out whole rooms with two back to back novas and still no massacre medal yet.  I'm hoping another map will have more adds per section after todays reset.
---
Oh that happens on pc too at least you got fast inventory access I  gotta wait a good 10-20 seconds on Xbox 
---
Where's J√∂tunn?
---
I recall prometheus week one. Crucible was total laser tag
---
If all but one land on 20 you get smugglers word
---
It was rubbing it face on the mouse but I tried to get her attention 
---
Yeah, I initially was just kind of "why are we doing this over and over, this is kind of silly in-game lore-wise." Then I started listening to the dialogue and realized that everyone was IN on that, and I was like, "oh shit...that's kinda cool." 
---
I'm definitely looking forward to freeing these guys of the curse; it doesn't really matter to me, since I'm there for the grind anyway, lol.
---
Understood, nerfing fusions
---
Same happened to me. I was just going with it lol
---
ü§£ wouldn't surprise me.
---
PvE meta:
---
* Any ARs or Pulse rifle with good perks mostly.
---
* Threat Level Shotgun, Ikelos, Lord of Wolves.
---
* Wardcliff Coil, Whisper of the Worm (mainly only used for like 2 raid bosses now though), Legend of Acrius is making a comeback. Hammerhead, Thunderlord.
---
PvP:
---
* Last Word. Debatably Thorn, but imo it's not that common. people are starting to realize it's not that great in pvp. Ace of Spades is still commonly used. As well as the usual pulse rifles. Go Figure, Blast Furnace, Bygones, etc.
---
* Shotguns got nerfed, but are still common. Dust Rock Blues, Mindbender's Ambition. 
---
* Sniper Rifles are becoming more common now. 
---
* there's this one energy Fusion Rifle alot of people use whose name I forget.
---
* Hammerhead, Thunderlord, Play of the Game, Wardcliff
---
Well, I don't really know about that I put the Jade rabbit there because it looks good. All I know is, Jade Rabbit is created by Daito. Cayde-6 commissioned Banshee-44 to built the Ace, Banshee is a client to Daito. So, Bunshee might use Daito's parts to build Ace.
---
These are consistently awesome. Are you doing these as vectors? 
---
The best Kubric reference
---
This sounds beautiful
---
Dominance apparently, yet its a game. But people are just ignorant as hell these days and have no idea what fun means. If stomping in 6 stacks is fun, then I don't know what life they lead. 
---
 Snapshot sights and hip fire grip on **sniper rifle**
---
Im fine with a 6 stack, its a 6 stack that are obviously being assholes, T-bags invites to the worst player to ask if they have thumbs (yes it happened to my kid brother who is brand new) they roll with Spectral Blades and all Meta weapons, usually with NF/Luna's and Wardcliff. Thats what most of this is about.
---
The SMG is called The Recluse and the fusion rifle is called Erentil FR4
---
Gambit Primevals are Shaxx
---
I must admit I do find teabagging completely infuriating and infantile. I absolutely fucking despise it. 
---
Did the same thing and had no progress. I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs bugged in the gambit playlist. It progressed for me in gambit prime.
---
He knows you are going to cry/scream in Ranked
---
That's not what they meant by being ascendant
---
OK thanks for the advice üòä
---
Man ace lore is so sad
---
watch it being Strange Terrain, Tree of Probability and Xol
---
Honestly i enjoy invading more than anything when it comes to gambit so of course i run the full 15+ set. It has earned me the most ridiculous hate mail I've ever had to read. But i love the fact i can tank a Jotuun shot cause I'm so tired of it being over used. 
---
I usually laugh and don't respond. They want you to get tilted and play worse. I will throw down a bag on a player for a long time after he bags me. Ill do it while getting shot and die, Just full duration while he waits to respawn, I want him to see me bagging him. Usually has a great effect in making them forget objectives. I never throw the first bag, cause it's pretty infantile, but im not afraid to play that game with the toddlers.
---
Well just for the eu bud 
---
There are bounties in Gambit that will give you 640+ armor/weapons if you complete them. Just talk to the drifter in the tower to get them.
---
If so that great maybe more out side time and family time. Video games go back to you have to earn it not buy it. I see good.
---
CRUSH THEM
---
Thanks for the elaborate answer! Yeah invaders really have it best even the +3 sounds really good, but that's not for me. I can get 2-3 kills while invading but there are people way better than me with their constant Army of Ones so more power to them.
---
So really no point in playing sentry atm? But for real, how likely is it that Bungie will change the armor set perks in the near future? I mean I like playing this role, but it's not really viable it seems.. 
---
Thank you üôèüèº 
---
If it was a heavy it would make it a horrible exotic choice.
---
Dammm what‚Äôs the shader?
---
I think it looks like ass =D
---
Go pickup the blue bounties from the drifter, they give 640 gear on completions. Other than that just do all your milestones every week, between those and prime engrams you can up around 15 levels per week. 
---
I mean if you can win a game while single capped by a large margin, quickplay is going to do NOTHING for a guild. I imagine these jerks laughing away in group chat like they are awesome. It made me so angry that they did that. 
---
To go pick it up from Amanda Holiday in the hangar
---
it will stop being popular once everyone gets the damn gun
---
but bottom tree Tether needs a buff because it's kinda shit. the only good thing about it it's the smoke bomb that turns everyone invisible for like 2 seconds
---
I for one am glad that some quests aren't simply left=right quests. Where eventually the numbers on the left will equal the numbers on the right and the quest will be done. Mindless grinding with no risk and no skill involved. 
---
Ask yourself this: in what world should the very best gear, specifically termed 'pinacle', be available to 100% of the playerbase for effectively free? Shouldn't the very best PvP weapon only be attainable by the best pvpers? 
---
You sound like someone who wants everything sold by a vendor for legendary shards. Triumph weapons are free. Learn to earn your bread. 
---
Take this down, a man lost his life. 
---
Someone else said you need to get 100K with the modifiers on etc 
---
Doing the Lord's work!!
---
Seeks like hive are the only viable enemy for massacre in prime 
---
I wish they would add a helmet like the ‚Äúhaunted‚Äù pilot helm in Halo: Reach
---
How was Venus and Luna? Never played D1.
---
No. The challenges are merely achievements. The unique item always has a chance to drop, but the chance increases with your score.

It's not like Truth to Power, don't worry. You are able to start the next invitation that comes after the one you last completed, no matter how many weeks have gone by.

With no score modifiers every acolyte or vandal tier enemy is 100 points.

[That's not true.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/9rjfwf/nightfall_specific_loot_farming_having_a_highest/) The unique items can drop at any score, but the chance increases for higher scores.

Hey who turned off the lights?
---
BUNGIE SHUT UP AND TAKE MONEY!!!!!
---
It‚Äôs a duke. Not sure about the shader. 
---
The armour and weapons he gives from the bounties are blues but once you‚Äôre at that level then go do all the weekly stuff and you‚Äôll be powerful purple in no time :D
---
Let's all celebrate the return of the Hammerhead frame at Ada. I've been happy with my PvE build (feeding frenzy and rampage), but now I'm rolling for an invader build (rangefinder, opening shot, Zen moment, that sort of thing). 
---
I imagine not every team gets smashed as hard as you did, some people are competent 
---
And Hammerheads and Gnawing Hungers!
---
Can someone actually ride with you? That would be awesome
---
Noticing it‚Äôs not a real car.
---
‚ÄúThey had us in the first half not gonna lie..‚Äù
---
1 person shouldn't invalidate the invader, it should be the whole team's responsibility to play around the invader
---
Oh I honestly didn't know that sorry. 
---
&gt;did I get banned for leaving?
---
Yes. If you are inactive for too long, you will be removed from the activity. You are banned for half an hour. This is to discourage people from sitting AFK in such activities to get the weekly "do gambit matches" challenge done. 
---
Thank you sensei this makes it much clear
---
If you play on PS4, feel free to add me. I really want to get in on the raids but hate having to LFG and I only have one good friend who plays consistently with me. PS username is same as on here.
---
There is significant uncertainty about how that quest drops. There are many hypotheses, but from what I've seen it looks like there are two ways to get it. 
---
* A very high likelihood of getting the quest when you reset your valor rank. It may be a guarantee, but I did meet someone who said it didn't drop until their second valor rank reset after the quest had been added to the game. I got the Chaperone quest from resetting my valor rank once. 
---
* A random drop from either the crucible or any activity after you have played at least one match each of quickplay and competitive. 
---
Once you have the quest drop once, it materializes in your other character's inventories as soon as they are done the Forsaken campaign, so a lot of people thought it just came from completing Forsaken, but that is not the case. Some people say that they never visually see the quest drop, but one day they talk to Amanda even though there is no quest marker over her, and she has the quest for them. 
---
Pretty sure there was a d1 card giving he details of what happened at he game
---
The quest has to drop first. For many people, it drops before they are done with Forsaken, so the quest marker doesn't show up until then, leading to the persistent belief that it simply comes from finishing Forsaken. That is not the case. 
---
Just one charge, doesn't do anymore after the first toss.
---
I have yet to run out of cores. But Datalattice during the great Lattice drought? Oh boy, Spider could have gouged us to hell if he wanted. But Spider is merciful. Thank you, Spider.
---
sorry she doesn't apply for your standards Mr Universe 
---
That was more so the D1 community. That was great. Ive found the the D2 community is much more toxic. 
---
OP is lying a bit or intentionally omitting information to push a viewpoint. 
---
Its $9.99 (before any Tax).  You buy 1,000 silver and get an extra 100 silver.  So $9.99 gets 1,100 silver which covers the skin.
---
I never got the BA pulse üòü when will it come around again I wonder? 
---
You get dem ez invades with any roll so my question still stands
---
&gt; ter¬∑ror¬∑ist/Ààter…ôr…ôst/*noun*noun: **terrorist**; plural noun: **terrorists**  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;1. a person who uses unlawful violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims. 
---
Many of the school shootings seem to have been performed by attention seeking kids presumably with mental illnesses. I'd have a hard time calling their aims political.
---
There's an exotic here and there that make you faster but that's about it
---
OP is not being honest.  T at minimum omitting information or pricing info on purpose to push a viewpoint/narrative.
---
 But yes $9.99 gets 1,000 silver + 100 bonus silver meaning before tax its $9.99 not  16.99 pounds (which is $24.99 converted) 
---
I think you can dismantle the mote btw
---
watch me as I get field prep and that fly perk on the first time
---
Man, that gun is actually so perfect for that situation. How long do the grenades last?
---
What's bugged?
---
Best games are that close
---
Do comp, I did it in like 5 mathces
---
Killlllll meeee!
---
Last season was also pretty bad. The one in the image is the one I want since I joined in Forsaken, but I guess we‚Äôll never get it...
---
The people (and there's a lot of them) that complain every week that it's not in the rotation, that's who.
---
I started shooting one once went from full health to dead in about .5 seconds many times now that has happened.
---
It was a very solid gun in D1 and is currently kicking my ass and preventing me from getting it in D2.  I want it because that is my nerdness, still annoyed I don't have Acrius or 1k voices yet (hard to get raids going).
---
The helmet stayed on
---
I think the issue has more to do with people not wanting to have to move off their preferred gear every so often and dislike the gameplay loop that comes with the light grind. 
---
I dont blame them as I too no longer participate in that grind. 
---
Did you enjoy Skip Grenade Crimson Days?
---
Playing prime I‚Äôm standing in we‚Äôll see someone invading go to take cover hear the sound of a missile titan and a blue streak going for a team mate, guardian down.
---
It did indeed
---
No need to appeal a ban if you'll never get banned in the first place
---
That was a good one
---
What?

Outside of the frame there is also a fireteam of rivensbanes with 1kv trained on poor uldren. yeet.

"**Iron in Bananas**: The U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference reports that an extra-small banana contains about 0.21 grams of iron, while a medium-sized banana provides 0.31 grams of iron. Even an extra-large-sized banana that is 9 inches or longer only contains 0.4 grams of or iron. **This low amount of iron found in bananas is not enough to meet your daily iron requirements**." .. hope that helps!
---
That's pretty cool, I didn't know that, thanks
---
Note im just posting this everywhere to see how many people i can get on this server 
---
Lmao. its true tho
---
So how many bananas do I have to kill everyday? 
---
THROW MORE GRENADES...
---
I MEAN DODGEBALLS
---
Hunter looking like Raziel

It looks good but it would mess up the hit boxes. But then people would want more for the different factions

Speaking of the reckoning, has anyone gotten any of the prime weapons from tier 2 today?
---
no
---
Wamu?

Lmao me too.

This was our first attempt at it...We beat it in two sittings. Could have done it in one, we were busy irl.

As someone with limited time to play, I almost never do scrapper bounties. I focus on the powerful drop activities until I get all the powerful drops for the week. Then, if I have time, I'll do a scrapper bounty. But it's not worth it to me for 1 core.
---
Masterworking past level 4 costs multiple cores. When they only drop 1 at a time, they go much faster than they come in.
---
Izanagis burden
---
META
---
Always cool
---
The guy in the back on the computer (actually doing work)  is our brains. He ran the map in both encounters
---
Cayde without hood still looks pretty cool if you ask me. Then again I also play as an Exo so maybe I'm biased.
---
Must not be.  First match in get matched up against a four stack. And so it continues.
---
My warlock got an exotic (Getaway Artist) from the Vanguard package
---
Yes! Nessus is boring for me and running around collecting Data Lattice is the worst
---
True 
---
My clanmate and I basically spent 3 hours in the tower during the Dawning playing dodgeball with the snowballs. It ended up being really useful when Black Armory came out because we got so much practice aiming with those things. 
---
Perk: when you ram someone with the car you can get memento mori 
---
No guardians are human, and only some of them were once. Zavala is Awoken, Cayde was Exo. 
---
I dont want a reason to spend money on useless cosmetics, and doubt others do as well. We already buy the base game, and the season pass. 
---
Racing would be a distraction for sure, but not a welcome one for everyone. If you're personally burned out on killing mobs and bosses. Then that's your deal. Not everyone feels the same, and this is a looter shooter game. Not Midnight Club. 
---
Maybe some player would be excited for SRL to return, but image all the ones who have been waiting for cool new lore and content o ly to be told that they can now race sparrows for cosmetics that add nothing and encourage them to spend their money on silver. 
---
That's gonna be a no for me dog
---
It's not a corrupted nightfall, it's a strike called "the corrupted" and is available as a nightfall this week.
---
You know SHAXX is black right....
---
First attempt doesn't mean that they were trying for 4 months straight...
---
Yes. It came in yeh April update before destiny 2 dropped. There was a whole slew of cards that dropped at that time. Including all the lore of what happened to Uldren after the battle at the dreadnaught. 
---
That set had a ton of good lore with it. Love or hate destiny the lore has always been spot on. 
---
She is a piece of log pretending to be acting, however. Pretty face, that's it.
---
Trinity ghoul for the win
---
Love Shax, baby looove Shax...
---
Only issue I have is I would prefer to grind with my weapon to have it grow instead of dumping cores into it. I guess in a way, I'd feel more of a personal connection to my gun if it grew with me. 
---
It's kinda like rare candy vs. hard grinding Pokemon, I guess is the best way to describe what I'd prefer. If they did that, though...I would like the masterworking to have more of an effect, and enhancement cores would cost more (like 5 or even 10 per level, depending on how much they would bump up the scaling). Maybe doing that incentivizes us to use then gun and not throw it in the vault until we have enough cores to MW it? I dunno, I'm just spitballing at this point.
---
Wrong sub? 
---
F
---
Gotta disagree. She did extremely well in Captain Marvel, but I can't say anything on her previous work since I've not seen it
---
she's *not forgotten*
---
Such posts show how narrow-minded our community is. You all **still** want to kill an innocent man? That's what Vanguard teaches us?  
---
Uldren is dead, we already took our rather pointless revenge. Guardians have no recollection of their past lives.  
---
That actually looks cool for a 20 minute sketch. 
---
oof, cringy
---
That's thorn you're referring to.
---
Should've done enough to get 3 matches then waited for reset to get there 
---
Umm?
---
I had 50 cores before the 700 update. Now I am 700 light with my old gear upgraded and I still have 50 cores. People are crybabies.
---
Yea ig. I barely see it and when I do I almost never die to it unless I‚Äôm weak
---
The past several weeks that section has just been a generic placeholder because the creator didn't know what to put there. Looks like he's found something now!
---
Our reaction to the sparrow section of Sourge was something I won‚Äôt soon forget. As soon as we opened the gate, we all started running forward, only to be immediately wiped by a giant ball of fire not realizing we had to go the other way

Haha, just use hand cannon with shotgun. If you don't have the skill Just use meta weapons. Try the Luna's howl quest, don't cheat yourself the quest is a journey to improve at crucible. After you will not only get the gun but also the game sense that came with playing comp. But also the queue dodging skills. 4 stacks are annoying. 
---
Anyways, to get a crucible focused weapon it will naturally include a crucible step. Stop bitching and watch cammy cakes. Actively try to improve instead of saying this is not working. If everyone rushes you with shotgun. Anticipate it. Outplay it. I got the last word in 2 days and you can too. Try to stay alive more than trying to kill. Don't take fights you can't win. 
---
Shaxx's voice is my motivation.
---
Good luck guardian. Don't give up.
---
PC? I can play some crucible with you.

Can you send me a blank version of this format

There is one on Nessus too, and I‚Äôm sure that there are some on other planets... not sure if this is an accident anymore ü§î

Well do you need a sniper with grave robber ? Field prep on a sidearm?  Armor pieces with primary ammo scavenger ? There are loads of crap  you can throw away. Just look at it logically.

Nice! I am still chasing that Black Talon.

Pretty disappointed you thought it would be okay to post this.

Are you sure bubble blocked bb before? I don't use it much, but I know for a fact that nowdays Bubble gets popped by BB helm or no helm, saw it first hand in Mayhem. I also didn't hear any complaining around that balance patch, so I'd guess the current situation isn't any different to before.
