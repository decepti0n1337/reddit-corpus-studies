Makes sense, thanks for the tips.
---
---
---
Are you joking? Because looking at this post I honestly couldn‚Äôt tell.
---
That striker about to slam the whole team lmao
---
PvP
---
It‚Äôs an acquired taste even though I love it it does have flaws like its clip of 8 is terrible and without the catalyst it‚Äôs unusable
---
Lmao last time this happened I was still chasing No Land Beyond I was beyond hyped for Xur to show up bc he was selling it frequently but I kept missing out. Super hyped to find I stayed up for literally nothing. Good ole days
---
I like it.
---
1st no trials of the nine. Now no nine exotic guns!? I sense someone plotting against the gaurdians
---
Ok, in that case, having certain amounts of resilience only helps in very select situations. For example, having resilience above 4 stops you from being two shot with Ace of Spades charged up bullets. It's not like you think, it's a very minor increase in health. 
---

---
What you have to do is hit headshots, and not be shot at by more than one person at a time. If it feels like you are being vaporized and not able to kill anyone, this would probably be why.
---
When Cayde-6 is dead but you already bought his whole stock üéâ
---
What I wanna know is how you have everything else and the 40 matches done without the 40 being the last thing
---
I did Strange Terrain for the NF weapon about 100+ times without it dropping. Just for Wayfarer too.
---
But did they forget about Euron's fleet?
---
FUCKING FINALLY!
---
beacuse he stoped using ar's after 49 games ?
---
Ah thanks brother gonna try to get my hands on one!
---
It a strange world we live in. The best way to help Cayde is not to help him at all.
---
For sure. Its definitely one if my favorites. It's got pretty dang good stability and I find myself using it quite a lot.
---
This one is already sold, but I could make another one for you
---
i‚Äôve only had 3 ever since the start of black armory. run forges, so your bounties and you‚Äôll get one eventually!
---
Thx bro, I was more worried about if I should have paid the guy but you guys seem to think I‚Äôm fine. Thank you for being a bro.
---
So cayde didnt appeal to you? Each to his own, but he isnt trash. He had the best lore out of the vanguards and was more friendly towards players in game. Dont forget that he was a hunter vanguard too, a title for some of the best guardians.
---
He wasnt the smartest vanguard but he was by far the best
---
Thx bro I‚Äôve been feeling bad but you guys are making me feel better :)
---
I guess maybe because I have armaments it is a bit easier.
---
If you look at it objectively, you just had a good teammate, he offered and you denied but you stuck around and did well with him. Nothing bad.
---
Hell no, don't pay. He didn't have to stick with you.
---
Needed one more win for fabled last night got lucky and had a 3 streak going then bam twice back to back 4 stacks
---
Mm. Why can't I remember what KO is?
---
Kindled Orchid lol

---
There we go lmao. I have a bad memory
---
Thank you Mr. Lord Shaxx. You are probably the best reassurance because you are one of the crucible gods.
---
Fuckem. That shit is scummy for everyone involved, so you were the antihero today.
---
If you‚Äôre not gonna buy any expansions it‚Äôs gonna take you a fat minute to level your light. You can do the raid every week (only leviathan) but that won‚Äôt help you much
---
You‚Äôre right, I guess it was just his passive aggressiveness that was getting to me. Thanks for the support bro
---
Just realized I have my own KO with Rapid Hit and Outlaw, with Flared Magwell and reload masterwork on top of that too. No DM tho
---
Found what?
---
If you're referring to the Dead Drop adventure, it should have popped up on Titan. If you haven't done it already (on the character you're progressing through the quest on) you may have to do it twice. Or at least that's what happened to me.
---
Superman V Batman.
---
Losing 1000 was a hypothetical. God help anyone who that actually happens to.
---
It's not that good, all the other fusion rifles are hit scan rather than having travel time like jotun. A well rolled erentil will eat its toast every day.
---
Shows as him selling suros in the app now. Didn't show it before. Bug must have been fixed.
---
-_-
---
‚ÄúFor every rose, a thorn.‚Äù
---
Since the triumph for the Bones is 150 pts, I‚Äôm going to guess it‚Äôs the one for collecting all the Crystallized Thoughts. They look like lil alien gumdrops
---
Guess they fixed whatever went wrong.
---
There seems to be a secret effect where you can do the combo in reverse, get a kill with anything else and then get a hit with Fighting Lion and it will still get the bonus shot. (Example, get a melee kill, then hit something with Fighting Lion, you should be able to shoot again.)  
---
Doesn't seem to work in PvP though, only PvE.
---
[Some of these sites have complete triumph lists](https://old.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/boo6rf/weekly_reminder_of_every_useful_destiny_related/).
---
Blind well. Over and over. Not specific but that‚Äôs essentially all I do in DC and have had 15+ (under exaggeration, but if I told you the real number you wouldn‚Äôt believe it)
---
They had us in the first half. Not gonna lie.
---
Yup, bottom tree makes orbs or precision hits.
---
Riven: !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
It's on hit too, but higher on kill.
---
You forgot when he leaves his invasion portal watch for a few seconds to grab heavy ammo, go invade and get sniped before his hammerhead gets close enough
---
Damn, I'm not really sure when it comes to consoles I'm on pc /:
---
A Cadenza-11?
---
Please this is too raw, I gotta start Forsaken on my third character today and I've got the tissues ready
---
Feel free to repost with something that makes a bit more sense.
---
Higher on the beat
---
Those are rookie numbers
---
OP‚Äôs attemting to make a joke about how Internet Explorer is slow, not realizing that the meme is already the desecrated carcass of what once was a horse
---
i mean... it just doesn't feel the same when i can so clearly hear NOT Nathan Fillion....
---
Two knifes? If that second knife did 100x the normal damage then maybe.
---
You sound like a very, uh, nice guy.
---
Nah, him not having a wep was a bug. He's selling Suros now on PC atleast.
---
What?
---
I feel this in my bones
---
And here I thought my 13k on Broadsword was good
---
Magnus did nothing wrong on purpose, but also didn't actually achieve anything good accidentally.
---
console?
---
I'm sitting at just under 65k with my Duke: https://imgur.com/a/06s0CAQ
---
Most paid carries are about $40, the cheapest ones at about $20. He may be a nice guy, but he‚Äôd be scamming you if you took him up on the $170 offer.
---
as a sluggish Titan, I've mastered the strafe, rarely die to it now but I'd rather take that toaster to the face than fight the bloody Luna nowadays.
---
He is. His shopping list was speedily updated to sell the regime.
---
Headshots dealing no damage, rockets dealing no damage, cross mapped through walls by lunas, people zooming around the map immune to damage. Ya, was a fun four games
---
no it was the garbage compactor
---
Can we get an "F" in the chat bois?
---
how about a comp mode that rewards players with SILVER for winning?
---
üòî
---
Could be a good idea if they ever bring back trials. So you can't over farm it. 
---
And as an apology for it being gone so long.
---
How
---
here's how it works.
---
you hurt something with it than kill that thing. regen shot.
---
but also. there's a way to do it in reverse, hard to explsin honestly.
---
&gt;Teammate picks up heavy when nobody is nearby and only he gets it
---
Yep, this is D1 alright
---
umm... w... what?
---
Sick
---
Definitely buy the bundle that comes with the game, forsaken and the annual pass. Youll save a lot of money. Drifter is like the weird uncle that let you smoke a cigarette and drink a beer when you were a teenager. Pretty cool to you but also very irresponsible. Warlocks wear dresses so dont bother with that class. Titan are just yeeting jocks. Hunters are where its at.
---
I havent played the first game, but I feel like there is something fishy about the Vanguard. I wouldnt trust them either. 
---
10/10. Great game, why are you still on reddit. GO. BUY. NOW.
---
A few buffs and nerfs, so the pve meta has changed a bit if you are into raiding. Crucible hasn't changed much as far as I know. 
---
A few new quests that give lore have been introduced. To begin, talk to the Drifter and he will give you a quest that looks like a gambit coin on fire. Once you do that, it makes more bounties and another quest available. Also, Xur sells Invitations of the Nine that I highly recommend doing. You can only do one per week, with "week" being Thursday to Thursday for some reason. 
---
There's a lot more, but you should find it passively by playing.
---
It even hurts more when you hear Cayde-6 talking in heroic missions
---
Don't listen to this guy about Warlocks. He speaks lies.
---
And since we have thorn we could purge it of the hive and have the Rose.
---
gonna guess Skull of Dire ahamkara
---
Since when do people use bottom tree hammers or burning maul over fist of havoc, or bottom tree sentinel? 
---
If that is what you‚Äôre getting in your game, I would gladly swap places.
---
F
---
DUDE, MARK IT A SPOILER.
---
I DIDNT KNOW HE DIES, IM LEVEL 18 FFS
---
Thats not how it works
---
#yeet yeet
---
What a bunch of faggots.
---
I can Never unser this... thanks.
---
He can get OEM from Engrams you know that right?
---
 I keep seeing the word raid everywhere but still no clue what that means
---
Yeah, but probably just as a random idea he thought of.
---
and drifter carried it on for him
---
Eh. I've stood at the portal for a few seconds when I know it's going to open. Only when I have a full Invader set equipped though. I'm not about to let some blueberry, without any reckoning gear, waste it.
---
Oh yeah, he was and still is my favorite character of the game. Still kinda angry that they killed him.
---
For some reasons this glich has been happening a lot lately... and also my sound sometimes gliches out for a sec
---
me not having the annual pass :(
---
Clearing the cache seems to have worked. Thanks for the suggestion. I can play now.
---
This is pretty funny ngl
---
But destiny one who can hate
---
But the most important part is that if he a warlock, he be skating
---
What do you mean?
---
Like the graphics weren't as good but the game oh the game.... Actually good
---
Destiny 2 is pretty great aside from a few small, fixable things
---
The catalyst makes a world of difference. Started using it recently after getting the catalyst months ago, and it‚Äôs like a completely different weapon.
---
Thank you
---
Hey. You see Cayde around, tell him his gun's ready. ‚ÄîBanshee-44
---
Banshee stares at the paper, then turns it upside down.
---
"I never said I was an artist," Cayde says over Banshee's shoulder. "This gets at the spirit of it."
---
Banshee turns the paper around again. "So that's‚Ä¶"
---
"The laser tracker, yeah."
---
"Huh." Banshee tilts his head. "And those‚Ä¶"
---
"Racing stripes."
---
"‚Ä¶On a fusion rifle."
---
"We're just‚Äî" Cayde throws his arms up. "We're just tossin' out ideas here, pal! Don't shut anything down until you get the whole picture."
---
"Seems like the picture's the problem."
---
"OK. Listen‚Äîthe details aren't important. I just want a good gun that you take out and the fight's already over." He shoots at invisible opponents. "Tsuu-tsuu-tsuu! The end."
---
Banshee relaxes. He knows good guns.
---
Cayde clasps Banshee's shoulder. "So is that a yes?"
---
"Uh-huh."
---
"Great!" Cayde claps his hands. "Not to rush your genius, but chop-chop, all right? I maybe made a bet with a certain Crucible handler, and I maybe don't have the Glimmer to back it up, so‚Ä¶ By the way, you'll do this on an IOU, right?"
---
 Banshee points to the paper one more time. "Is that‚Ä¶?"
---
"A bottle opener, yes."
---
I bought Frostees as I didn't have it yet. Then went for the dates engram and got Shards. Had just completed the Malfeasance quest too.
---
Awwwwww yeahhhhhhh
---
I bought Frostees as I didn't have them. Bought the dates engram and got Shards. Also just got my army of one to complete Malfeasance.
---
Awwwwww yeahhhhhhh. It was a good night last night.
---
I once saw a 405 power level midnight coup with 56000 kills one week after the prestige raid lairs were released. He did that in a month.
---
Everything but the last two lines: I‚Äôm fine
---
‚ÄúI wish Cayde were here‚Äù and the tears are flowing.
---
Why are there onion cutting ninjas near me everytime I watch this.
---
r/thanosdidnothingwrong
---
I mean the d1 all white look of suros it was a pun on my part
---
oh.
---
ah ha.
---
They meant Banshee obviously
---
Baby legs detective
---
Garrosh did nothing wrong
---
No indication of drop chance changes in the recent patch notes or TWAB (This Week at Bungie news post). 
---
I think this person just is lucky and thinks that will extend to others.
---
Those bastards are worse than Oryx
---
Ahhh. Thank you!
---
I think him and the clan in general are pretty dope :) 
---
First clan I've ever joined in Destiny and they've really helped me grow as a player and helped me through a lot of content, I've managed to run all D2 raids with them as well which I think is awesome.
---
**SPIN THE WHEEL**
---
Yeah i'll prob end up watching the streams, its interesting watching them figure out mechanics and whats going to work best.
---
Those sweet 360 graphics
---
I agree with you, just kind of a lighthearted ‚Äúwhat are the odds‚Äù post. I had been trying for the bow for weeks!
---
Borealis works as well!
---
I've never completed a raid because people get needlessly angry with me when I fail or am involved in them failing.
---
That trials helmet though 
---
Shinyyyyyy xD
---
I've been on that team with 5 rounds won and still lost more than once. There's always hope. Eyes up Guardian
---
I believe it has the added ornament, but I don't remember
---
SPIDER-THRALL, SPIDER-THRALL, DOES WHATEVER A SPIDER-THRALL DOES
---
It got fixed yesterday
---
Cool, i'm clanless at the Moment and i'm fairly sure that your clan seems so nice lol.
---
I'm even playing on PS4 too. I might not be that passionate but I'm always or almost always up for raids. Guess the only problem I have is the time difference cuz I live in Germany.
---
oh my gosh that's a great idea! 
---
Im sure with Crown of Sorrows and SoO coming out theres definitely a speech coming haha.
---
May I join? OddBoiNoopy Ps4
---
Thanks blackout
---
Are you sure you are doing activities that list "powerful gear" as the reward?
---
I just use my curated bellowing giant with taken spec. I have rocket reserves so I have 8 round and I still out DPS everyone else.
---
This looks like a great time to pull a LEEEEERRRROOOYYYYY JENKINS.
---
Are you sure you are using right word ? I mean what vooping has to do with anything here
---
Ê≠ªÔºÅ
---
This is amazing.
---
Breakneck for sure, charge up takes a little bit but once rampage is on it can rip through enemies
---
In PvP resilience mainly helps with body shots and charged up weapon perks, but no one is aiming for the body on purpose so resilience doesn‚Äôt help against headshots.
---
In PvE resilience does make you a little bit more beefy to stand against the odds and debuffs.
---
Rapid-fire frame + snapshot is the way to go. The best options right now are supremacy, alone as a god and the curated twilight oath (can't roll snapshot if not curated.)
---
Should we tell them?
---
Are you sure you are looking in the right spot? There are a variety of guides with screenshots showing the exact location. 
---
Maybe try going to orbit and coming back? Sometimes quest progress doesn't register if you don't do that, but I have never heard of the fallen transponder having this problem.
---
LMAOOOOOOO
---
Yeah node 1 is in the drain by the purple tarps if I‚Äôm correct?
---
The "year pass" for this game is a bundle of three DLCs releasing over the course of a year. It's not a subscription or anything. 
---
Last year, for D2's one year anniversary, you could get the base game for free on PC and I think PS4, but I am not sure about xbox. The two year anniversary is coming in September, so there may be a similarly good deal. 
---
The DLC does regularly go on sale every few months, so it's best to wait for a sale.
---
In the cave area, not the part of the lost sector with the chest, yes.
---
What's wrong with it?
---
No, you can get it from the warden strike
---
Where are the hive in Wardin of Nothing?
---
ehhh, what?  
---
if you run with shotgun equiped but are using armor with fusion rifle perks, aint my fault, some ppl do min max their builds  
---
so, don't presume next time that everyone just equips what God's drop and go into reckoning unoptimized
---
I've yet to do a single raid, especially this one, for fear of netting all the wrath of the sherpas if I get 1kv to drop on my first run.
---
Okay, sounds good. I thought if I get the pass I could get all dlc's from the previous years and if that was the case, I would have waited until next year. I'll wait until a sale thank you.
---
Literally he has trust distant relation bad omens and bygones for sale.
---
I just checked again and it wasn‚Äôt there ,so am I locked out of outbreak prime now?
---
Have you. . . been to the tangled shore? There's not only one lost sector of hive, but *a whole area of hive* called Jetsam of Saturn.
---
I can confirm that white ones can be destroyed with everything.
---
as in, you elitists right? I go in the game, right? and I take my Erentil, right? and I voop you repeatedly with my fusion rifle while cackling like a madman
---
Curated sole survivor
---
Great thanks I‚Äôll try it out later
---
Good question!
---
That‚Äôs not true.
---
Just forged a blast furnace this morning with flared magwell, feeding frenzy, Kill clip with a stability rework. 
---
Got a hammerhead with quickdraw rampage High Cal rounds and arrowhead brake with a range rework. It shreds pretty nicely too. 
---
I came back to destiny a couple of months ago, since my PS4 can barely run the new games it seems. Destiny has been great to get back into. I‚Äôve been gone since double primaries pretty much, and didn‚Äôt care for the graviton lance meta so I didn‚Äôt stick around for that. But now it‚Äôs been pretty good! The revelry event really got me back into pve as I was mostly just a pvp player before. 
---
Which is tough to do in destiny2 when most of the good, powerful weapons come from playing pve. 
---
I think it would be a great idea! There‚Äôs so much to do even after you‚Äôve completed a lot of quests and stuff like that.
---
Verities Brow is a quest item you can only get it by beating warmind on your warlock
---
Good. Sweet Business needs to go away.
---
Yeh I know. I‚Äôm grinding my ass off over today, Sunday and Monday.
---
This game is a grind, so keep that in mind.
---
I always have it on
---
I'll whisper you my code. :)
---
Do it, the hard parts already done
---
cool
---
Definitely. It just means you'll be a little behind, but I'm sure you'll catch up. The guns in Black Armory and Gambit Prime are great and always roll with awesome stats.
---
Not if you think D1 looks better
---
You just posted this a minute ago...
---
I really wish I was in your clan
---
Ive seen a buddy of mine rock 90+k on his Fighting Lion on one char... then another 50k on a different char... just blows my mind.
---
I think it's more analogous to Sunshot, Graviton Lance, and Riskrunner in that it's both a campaign reward and a random world drop. It's not *only* from quests, like (random example) Worldline Zero.
---
75 members in 6hrs??
---
They won‚Äôt drop randomly unless you‚Äôve already gotten them
---
this is better
---
If you have the annual pass play gambit prime in a pre-made fireteam, and play collector.  They should leave the motes for you to pick up, just watch out for invaders.
---
It will remain difficult due to level caps like whisper/throne/old raids, while it will be marginally easier due to a small increase in the delta, but you won‚Äôt be breaking through this content at 750
---
Wine can do that. I don't even know what that galactic shit tastes like, but I bet you the rose-coloured glasses are phenomenal.
---
Yeah, so you get 40 levels for free
---
Usually happens if you use a super on an enemies bubble. Blade barage eh works wonders on damage numbers.
---
Managed to do this solo and its tough but can be done. Always bank in 15s, hunter with graviton forfeit and top tree nightstalker is handy for gettin in to the middle of a pile of adds when theres motes around them, also being able to go invisible on dodge is great when ur getting overwhelmed. Keep count as u go, so many times I won the game but had 73 or 74 and make sure u have none on u when the PE spawns cos dying at that stage still counts as losing them. Also hide from invaders and pray they leave u alone but having something with stopping power like jotunn that can put them down quick helps. Ideally when they invade just get bankin. Other than that its all persistance. Hope this helps and good luck!!
---
Those are words. Sure.
---
Then why comment on this post?
---
But you would still be at a 10 LL disadvantage for the raid
---
the "source" isn't very informative, i thought it was just a random drop chance, not based on how many black armoury weapon frames you built
---
They‚Äôll just wait untill next season to do the raid
---
You aren't the only one I haven't done any of the things that require a fireteam to do them
---
No loa no rat king etc.
---
Are they nerfing it?
---
Can't go wrong with either really. Just depends who you are up against enemy wise. I'll be using my recluse and have a couple trench barrel shottys in the wings just in case.
---
No don't be the guy with nine captures which caused his team to lose
---
Well that's a dumb fuckin rule.
---
