"Yee-Haw" - Shin Malphir. Also congrats

We know we’re going back to that location (The Black Garden) but we don’t know anything else. It’s not going to be a copy of the Black Garden raid at all. Just like Earth and Mars, I expect our “going back” to be in very different locations or different enough.

That should give you a bit of insight.
---
Or rust. The blue tangled shore shaders are neat. Maybe not on solstice armor though.
---
Also, if there are some you don’t like and you can’t get a respawn because you don’t want to do that one, go to orbit and they’ll reset.

I'm Gambit prime you can only get curated rolls for doing specific things like killing blockers immediately as they spawn, In the reckoning you can get random rolled weapons after beating the boss. Tier 2 and tier 3 have different weapons
---
Talking mad shit for someone in shoulder charging distance
---
Yeah that too. I realized that earlier
---
Happy cake day man and thanks
---
She has a challenge for you to complete 20 bounties from everybody else in a week. Gunsmith bounties, Zavala, Shaxx, Ada, Tess, Sloane, Devrim, etc. Once you’ve completed 20 in a week you go to her and she gives you a Powerful Reward. You may have finished it and claimed it earlier this week without realizing it. Hover over her icon in the map, if it says0/20 or 11/20 or something you can still complete it.
---
I agree he needs shoulder charged once
---
I know. I’ll probably change my mind later, but it’s just been a really long day lmao
---
It's just one subclass (Juggernaut) that's a *little* broken, not the entire Striker tree. IMO, it's a fair trade-off (if the timer was a little shorter) for having zero damage resistance in super unlike Arc staff, spectral blades, or dawnblade. 
---
Hate it when you see a red one in crucible, love it when it's a blueberry in gambit. 
---
Everybody complains about Titans having OEM in PvP but rifts are just fine... you have to prepare and play OEMs the same as Titans have to look out for hunters with shards.
---
Not gonna lie geomag meme beam is hella damage, better with bad juju or risk runner and verity brow
---
Thanks!
---
Congrats. Ya the last mission got me almost throwing my controller at the tv lol
---
I also severely regret waiting until the last day. This morning I was halfway done with the blue set, now I’m really close, and wish I had just done a lot of it earlier this month
---
Additionally, you can do Tess's bounties as many times as you have notes for, they aren't limited to once per day or week like every other NPC.
---
I sadly don't have the juju, but I've used it with riskrunner and it's nasty, lately I've gone back to sunshot (I know haha) and militia's birthright (blinding grenades) with hammerhead and it's been a great build.
---
The last mission wasn’t that hard but it’s more tedious with all the flicks to take that piece of shit down
---
Titan love weak guardian tears.
---
Hey op what the fuck is this?
---
Biggest thing I ask people who actually think this: What do you think Activision was stopping them from doing? Armor 2.0? They've been moving in that direction since Forsaken. Artifacts? We had those in Destiny 1. About the only thing that Activision might've held them back on was Cross Save since they had a contract with Playstation.
---
I wouldn’t consider it a side quest I’d consider it more in Line with exotics since it gives you 2.0 gear right off rip
---
You wouldn't of enjoyed getting the original Outbreak Prime then.
---
I want to meet this guardian so bad.
---
Right! Just fucking help them out and get on with the match no one gives a Fuck if they died when you didn't! Just revive them!
---
I was rezzed as a titan but I identify as the CRUCIBLE
---
Bold words for someone in shoulder charge distance
---
"hehe titan dumb"
---
(goes to crucible)
---
"boohoo, titans too good!"
---
... i don't get it. are you better then titans or not?
---
Good boi does a meme and shreds the competition
---
I appreciate the doge meme
---
I had to do 400 solar orbs in strikes, 25 patrols on Titan and 100 arc super kills this morning.  You can finish it!!!!!!
---
OK so I definitely did this. I saved all my bounties for the 50 I needed on the blue armor. I also did nightfall for my 2. Crucible, gambit, and all clan activities were done last week :/
---
Not quite! They're Star Destroyers :)
---
Agreed. I love syntho’s with just about any spec, especially with the eververse ornament, unfortunately it just synergies best with bottom tree striker. However, I despise the shotgun meta and I think OEM is a crutch. So I guess I’m only like 1/3 bad?  Lol.

Did bad juju get nerfed or something? Because i swore about a month ago everyone was screaming about the bad juju being amazing
---
We can all do something that the Warlocks can't: ** punch**.
---
Will grab it from Steam :D
---
Uhhhh....welcome to last year? The Graviton Lance was a God when the catalyst was released with the revamped faction rally last year but there are way better options out there now. Also, if you don’t have the catalyst for it, then there are a ton of better options.
---
I kept it ;)
---
I know they’re fixing the stack vs solo queue issue, but are they taking a look at how matchmaking works at all either?  Because that has sucked a lot too even when I’m matched against only other solo-queuers.
---
No, but bad juju in d2 is just not as potent as it was in d1. Not really worth using over outbreak or recluse imo
---
Yeah ive yet to get recluse. It’s a pain
---
Brilliant but f for Cayde
---
It really depends on the situation but preferably I always use Outbreak Perfected, Jotunn, Anarchy, 1k voices, Bad Juju and Thunderlord
---
Been grinding those, it's slower going because you need the ghost fragments though.
---
Imo that’s the best pve primary weapon at the moment, definitely worth getting
---
Wtf is this and where is this. Please tell me it’s real
---
Funny coming from the class that needs guided abilities to aim for them.
---
Preference. I personally prefer Warlock, but it's honestly whatever you prefer. Things like how the class looks is entirely subjective and up to you.
---
Accurate. But don’t let your knowledge of what something is limit your imagination as to what it could be...just saying.
---
As a titan I must disagree simply to defend titan honor
---
There really isn't a better class, a good player can make any class work. It's honestly just preference.
---
Oh i know but i was going to wait until solstice was over and some sweats might leave
---
Literally all of my melees in crucible feel like this lately
---
You forgot “Hammerhead”
---
Yes they are. Director's cut part 3talks about how they're overhauling pvp in destiny
---
?
---
The fastest way would be the crucible
---
Thank you!
---
Character level boost (if you have Forsaken and haven’t already used it). Then probably nightfalls, strikes, and Crucible with a fireteam medallion active.
---

Reckoning is not available?

I think there are going to be two infamy multiplier weekends before Shadowkeep.
---
Tru
---
Yeah! I think you, the first person who replied and I can run though later tonight! Imma raid with some folks first then I’ll message you guys
---
I only have raid armor from cheesing the chests. My old clan was not active at at, hope this new one is.
---
Yikes
---
Dood, that's insane. You got a double kill with a shotgun? Holy shit, thats the most clutch play I've ever seen in my life.
---
Why the down votes
---
You just happened to have two other chaos reach warlocks on your team and you all decided to pop your super at the exact same time. That is the most amazing anime weeb shit I've ever seen. I like your style.
---
Ohh...I can't even recollect this one then. I know there's one unique public event in DC where you defend a tower or some other structure and you collect arc orbs I think. It takes you into the ascendant realm once it goes heroic (and I don't know how to make it heroic). Only did this one like twice or thrice ever...
---
*laughs in dawnblade*
---
So close, just don't dip below 1,980 and you'll get it tomorrow at reset.
---
I got one word for you: reckoning.
---
There’s lots of things you can do, learn how to do Last Wish and Scourge of the Past since you’re a high enough to do that, do powerful bounties from certain vendors, do you daily/weekly strike, crucible, gambit matches. For a quick jump before you do any of that, you can do the power surge bounties that will get you to 690, there is also Iron banner starting tomorrow that you can do, even though you will need the power up that boosts your light by 100. Overall, you just gotta play the game, do the things that will give you powerful gear, and you’ll be max light before Shadowkeep.
---
Well actually all of us ran chaos and I think 3 of us had Geomag with one guy running boop cannon.
---
I like to think that my titan is a just a tad bit more intelligent than the average titan because my warlock is basically his designated babysitter.
---
No one likes the truth.
---
Because I thought a joke about another class was funny (though I enjoy playing them all)
---
That makes me hard.
---
That still doesn't make sense it was put up here as a joke for people to laugh at but you got down voted for laughing at it
---
There’s social media for you haha, I don’t mind at all, what they don’t know is I could care less who downvotes me 😂
---
Turn off mouse acceleration in Windows, turn off mouse smoothing in-game. Try to set your sensitivity to something consistent across all fps games - a good rule of thumb is that dragging your mouse across your pad should turn you about 180°. Use your arm, not your wrist - wrist-aiming can cause carpal tunnel and it's a bad habit. 
---
Eyes up, Guardian :)
---
Tracking rocket launcher does wonders
---
That's true though at least we can understand that much and take my upvote and have a good rest of the week
---
already done. but thanks for the reminder anyway
---
A warlock meleeing is just them face palming an enemy for their own stupidity for facing a guardian. Change my mind
---
Aye thanks man, you too!!!
---
IMMA FIRIN MAH LAZ0R!!!!
---
Can relate. If I'm passing by some enemies because I got stuff to do and not a lot of time to do it, and one of them shoots me, you can bet your ass I'm dropping everything I'm doing to turn around and waste my super of them.
---
Kazuya??
---
Same with the cheese.
---
Yeeeessss.
---
Well I don't play with a big enough mouse pad to really get used to it properly but it seems like it would be easier if I did. But that's probably just preference.
---
The wanted enemy in A Garden World drops it.
---
Hunters have the worst mobility, though
---
Thank you
---
Well...you must not have read all the comments. Keep reading.
---
That's the point. Titans are so brainless that even my grandma could get a 2.0 kd with them.
---
I didnt read your post, and I wont read it. So let me guess your issues.
---
Heavy ammo is too frequent. Yes it is, and it will be tuned down in shadowkeep.
---
Supers are too powerful, bottom tree striker is busted, there are so many supers in a single game, dawnblade is insane, stormtrance is really good at wiping teams, spectral blade is really annoying to deal with(just covering up all the possibilities). Supers are getting nerfed in shadow keep, super duration is getting reduced, super regen from kills and orb pick up is also being reduced, super armor is getting reduced.
---
Your teammates are bad, and every game of qp is a sweat fest. Bungie will change the match making algorithms a bit in shadow keep to make more skill based.
---
Comp is a fat pile of shit. It is, and it's getting changed, they're making it all 3v3 survivle, and adding a solo que playlist.
---
Complaining about special weapons, shotguns are bullshit, fusions are annoying, jotun is not fun to play against, snipers dont flinch and can still get headshots even though they're being shot by a weapon with high cal.  Just deal with it, if you change too many variables in your formula you'll never know what's wrong with it.
---

Revived a man that had delusions and no tether to reality. He had all the right things, but a few wrong things as well.

Thank you good sir
---
I've only gotten it from resetting my valor rank in Crucible. I'm not sure if it's a random drop during crucible, but that's the only way I've gotten it(on two characters).
---
I don't think you would, as that's how I am playing Forsaken Annual pass content on my PC with Xbox One characters, where on my Xbox, i only have Forsaken, and not the annual pass.
---
What system
---
Oh right. Xbox one
---
What the fuck are you on about? OEM doesn’t affect your ability to survive during your super whatsoever, and Striker does absolutely have damage resistance. If you’re getting one shot during your super, it’s most likely because you popped it in the open while you were already taking damage. Tatara with box breathing can one shot crit a super I believe, and a 90 rpm with box breathing also will if someone has minimal armor masterworked, but that’s all I can think of off the top of my head.
---
Sorry man I’m in ps4
---
Aw, well thanks anyway!
---
You can’t merge accounts. You either will have only your pc account or only your PS4 account.
---
r/fireteams
---
If you're on PC, I can get you into any of the raids with my clan, lmk

I didn’t realize that was a thing. Thank you!
---
No worries. A lot of people don’t.
---
God dammit, just take your upvote and go!
---
I had Megamind on my leavers jacket last year because I have a large forehead and loved the film when it came out. It was one of those things that everyone knew about and agreed was good but nobody talked about.
---
Its gonna be Aeon cultist armor
---
I need to run cos a bunch this coming week, I'm on PC and plan on doing it plus scourge and maybe wish on either Wednesday or Thursday, hmu
---
I have my main hunter in the first game good only as the Cape is mostly nonexistent and I felt kinda special as no one else really goes for that look, I love me some Cape but sometimes no Cape is fantastic too. Would love to see this
---
Why use lot word when few word do trick?
---
After the event? Oh thank god
---
What that neck do?
---
Well, was... Auryx was female, who then became Oryx, male. Plus ya know, Oryx has the title KING.
---
Just got my headpiece a couple of days ago, all I got left is CoS too!! You too bro
---
Yep. Take your time with it! Only works for the masterwork steps though ! Don't go trying to make green-blue armor or blue-purple armor after reset tomorrow.
---
Did everybody take a piss a simultaneous piss? Good five minute one?
---
I've been trying the Nightfall for the last 4 hours and was getting scared. Thanks
---
What score are you going for? Maybe I can help you out with modifers.
---
The Devil you KNEW
---
The damage stacking change is definitely going to effect the viability of Well for DPS phases. But it'll still... heal.
---
Chaos Reach w/ Geomag and Nova Bomb w/ Tractor Cannon will still remain, which is good. Not much else, though.
---
I say Warlocks are the best PvE class, but I'm starting to doubt myself. I don't agree with everything in this video, but it made me realize everything that's wrong with Warlocks: https://youtu.be/salFIj2kKDM
---
There's currently only one thing Warlocks have above the other classes: the ability to heal. There's a huge lack of synergy, and very few exotics are useful.
---
I'd be happy with some simple exotic tunes. I'd absolutely love to use the other 75% of my exotic armor, and not be putting my team at a disadvantage.
---
This became a Warlock rant and I apologise to all those who wasted their time reading this.
---
Except titans aren't inheritely more tanky than any other
---
I actually love running commander titan with overflowing light chest piece for one shot stickies
---
Clearly you aren’t playing enough gambit, I have had a LOT of really close matches, in fact I’d say more than half of them.
---
Hunter or warlock. I prefer hunter, I like hunter's triple jump mechanics more than warlocks jetpack-esque mechanics but warlocks do have some great abilities and supers.
---
200k, Hit me
---
Never seen one that was even close. Then again I’m known for having the shittiest matchmaking luck known to man in most PvP games
---
Each class has specific trees for each element. Most of them have some form of heal while warlocks have more potent methods such as the “rift” ability and devour. I really just recommend picking a class you actually find intriguing. All classes are viable and all sub-classes are too. You have 3 character slots, go to town fam.
---
Wait what? Is this true
---
Doesn’t really matter, game ain’t that deep or complex and there’s not much difference between classes other than supers.
---
We still ended up winning 6 - 5 but it was waaaaay to close
---
Are you really implying Wendigo isnt a super grind? Lol. It took me 4 hours, and that was doing blind well solo. 
---
You make no sense here. No, an Outrageous Fortune will not do as much as a Swarm bc it does less damage lol.
---
it is good for an auto rifle but a hand cannon would perform better. Idk if hcannons are hard to use on console but it is definitely better than an auto rifle. also r/sharditkeepit
---
It had 0 damage resist.
---
"I am Jez. Titan Slayer, Slayer of all Titans"
---
Th3Jez
---
Yes oem and bottom tree strikers are op like you said and that’s what I’m referring to
---
And this is where the conversation falls apart. You are no longer addressing the subject, but instead try to discredit me. This was never about the actual weapons for you. When I said something negative about the gun, You interpreted it as an attack and felt you had to defend yourself. If you actually did read some of my previous posts and comments, then you know that you have just written a falsehood. Listen, your identity isn't tied to the Recluse. It is ok for people to not like a fictional gun from a video game. And for the record, you mentioned earlier that success isn't only found in meta weapons, yet that recluse is in almost every clip you have posted. I will not reply to you again after this message, because honestly we have both wasted too much time on a pointless conversation. Stay safe out there guardian, and keep using what makes you happy. No matter what other people think about it.
---
Wha-
---
Thats taking the piss that!!!
---
The whole team: Kono, Giorno Giovanna, niwa yume ga aru
---
Hahaha
---
lol okay guy
---
What's your psn name?
---
But a titan can run across the map in a few seconds, nigh on invincible, instantly punching everyone to death. Balance.
---
That moment when Failsafe asks Cayde to delete himself, but he is already dead.
---
It's the Full-Dans brother, but I don't think that's a very good roll
---
Fr tho I gotta try this. This looks stupid fun, and I love shit like this pvp
---
Not really, man. Hand cannon's are super strong, especially the usual suspects (Luna, NF, LW, etc.) - the only one that perhaps isn't as popular as on PC is the Ace due to ability to easier hit those longer range headshots, even the it's still viable on console.
---
That was beautiful to watch
---
I have only played a couple of matches as a titan. OEM didn't magically make me good. I want my shards back Xûr!
---
That's actually great idea during the menagerie
---
Nothing to that extent but I would recommend chaos reach, you get all your abilities recharged pretty fast with the ionic traces and with geomag the super itslef does a lot of damage
---
Don’t kinkshame us!
---
What the hell is up with your fov?
---
What do you mean. I've turned my hud off and I play on quake pro
---
That is a valid point; we might see some good bundle options after the switchoff, to entice players to pay just a little more to get everything. I hope that’s the case.
---
I am warlock main.    And i have a secret to share with Destiny's community.   Every time i hear song "Journey", intro song or any other very emotional song (from destiny's soundtrack) i want to cry. :(
---
Looks like your new arround here. Golden gun is the only super in the game that doesn't have damage reduction, outside of you masterworked armor. So anything that can kill you normally, can also kill you in your super.
---
I like to play titan. I can blame my losses on the class and not my skills.
---
Yea i checked it but nothing there
---
This, honestly there's a bunch of things to do.
---
Sadly not
---
Ah, I see you're a man of culture as well
---
Which just makes more insane! Wonder if the old farming cheese would count? Skipping Waves 1-5 on additional kills.
---
Yeah, 25 quickplay matches in rapid succession for Redrix can do something to a man...
---
*puts keyboard on mouse mat*
---
*keeps mouse on wooden disk*
---
It’s not at all the best shotgun or overpowered.
---
Personally I ran a master worked Duke 44 the massive range made precision shots easy and with rampage you can one tap alot of enemy's plus multikills create orbs
---
I know man, crucible changes you. Good luck
---
As a warlock main, I approve
---
Ultimate Battle from DB Super popped in my head as I watched them all Kamehameha waved the boss to submission.
---
They’re really effective in the pvp meta, and combined with sole over-powered exotocs, way too good
---
Easymode in pvp
---
Why would the UI change like that? Oh cuz Bungo. I've almost done the exact same thing.
---
Had finished my last character at 1:30 last night. Even though I had class in less than 7 hours, I refused to quit and went to sleep satisfied (kinda).
---
What ogre? I\`ve been fighting a hydra all the time... Are there any specific things to look out for?
---
Does it play the pre patch screech? I want to deafen people
---
You have 3 races and 3 classes to choose, and 3 slots. Mix it up and make 3 different characters for 3 times the rewards. The most survivable character that kills the easiest is titan. So there’s that. Don’t be a one toon scrub, make all 3.
---
Yeh sure! Thx mate I'll definitely not you up :)
---
Oh... Well I'm mainly interested in pve so I guess that shouldn't bother me
---
Yeah a giant ogre
---
Nope you can keep it if it's not masterworked and you can masterwork it even after the event is done
---
No, you can keep it at majestic and masterwork it any time you want once the even is over
---
Haha that would be possible in an ideal world. But real world responsibilities don't allow me to do that.
---
I have done it
---
A team full of Arclocks? Amazing
---
What the fuck? I thought they extended it to September?
---
Titans currently have a single meta build that makes them broken and incredibly hard to fight against in crucible. That's where most of the hate comes from. One eyed mask, juggernaut striker, and high range shotguns. In pve titans are fun and strong, but they don't have a lot of the utility that warlocks and hunters have in terms of buffs, debuffs, and orb generation. 
---
Bottom line is that pve players think titans aren't up to par with other classes and pvp players think titans are toooooo strong and outclass other players just because of one exotic.
---
Every week theres a different boss this week its the hydra and the next its the ogre you have to kill the ogre boss
---
Titans are just the Destiny equivalent of the United States Marine Corps.
---
Savage
---
I just got a rapid hit rampage nightwatch and shreds adds like cheddar. I would say its a god roll but the other rolls aren't that exiting
---
Maybe he forgets every time he puts it down, all those rebirths made him a little slower
---
Thank you very much.
---
No they extended moments of triumph not solstice
---
You use jotun. I hate you
---
I got multi kill clip with rapid hit on like my first drop
---
Don't you have the DestinyGo app?
---
Get it?
---
Like pokeman go?
---
Heh I'm funny :)
---
But... but... what about Sexy Riven‽
---
Didnt finish my titan 😥
---
Ahh shit I thought it got to extended til September. How long would it take to get one armour set (titan) to Purple from the base armour? If I have time I can probably grind it out now
---
Sagira is definitely the best waifu
---
In lost is this just a video showing how bad you suck at blinking or what
---
And people wonder why many don't pvp.
---
Moments of Triumph is tied to the end of a year (and in D2, the last season of that year) as a way to commemorate all the feats and time spent playing in said year. It’s not the first time Bungie extended MoT too.
---
Solstice is an event, just like Festival of the Lost or Dawning. A handful of weeks and then it’s out.
---
5000 for each element.
---
Anything you get from Tess will dismantle to bright dust, even shaders.  When Shadowkeep launches these items will no longer give bright dust.
---
Yeah your right looks like a pretty solid PvP match, or are you looking for that compliment because you finished top.
---
&gt;pull shotty
---
Yeah there's my problem
---
good time in crucible haahaha thats not been possible since d1
---
Whats that blocky gun that you were using?
---
It is doable so long as you do not dawdle while playing go from one thing to another quickly.  Also, if you can get a fireteam to run with everyone else can make orbs for you to pick up.
---
So why aren't they also crying about hunters and warlocks?
---
If you go to your collections and look at what currency it costs to buy the item, that is the currency it will dismantle into. So if it costs bright dust, you'll get bright dust from dismantling it.
---
As a Titan of very high intellect I must say that the accusations against my species is absolutely horrendous at this hour. Shame on the degenerate warlocks who calls titans stupid when they should look in their own mirror. Braindead degenerates I say.
---
What would it be called if it was an exotic and what would its perks be?
---
Nah, warlock is the best class
---
My biggest problem has been  completing the five challenges. Turns out no amount of time spent in the last week will get you more challenge opportunities. Guess I’ll have to settle for no purple.
---
Next, grab a chalice, fill it with some purple planet drank, sit in it and a raise a toast.  Do it for the karma
---
Outplayed.
---
I'm really happy with the changes they made with this year's solstice of heros, the armor was a lot more fun to grind for and I actually managed to get the legendary set this year. Totally worth the grind.
---
Me neither! Next time I go online, it's... SELFIE TIME with my guest,  Colonel!
---
Can someone post a picture on wherever it is
---
^^ also gives you a range masterwork! Anyone who wants to use Rose should reacquire it from collections.
---
Because Titans dont cry?!
---
Parcel of Stardust
---
Reset hasn't happened yet.
---
And the other 2 classes?
---
The primary purpose of a spoon is to feed yourself. Whether you choose to feed yourself to excess with it or not is up to you, but ultimately you'd be hurting yourself. The primary purpose of a handgun is to inflict harm on another.
---
Well if you walk off the edge and you double jump accidentally and it sends you slightly down you can cancel your jump and jump again and you will catch yourself. If you're heading down the jump will not let you go down the second time you activate it. Then you can activate your grenade using the well subclass and you can hover for like 10 seconds and find a place of safety if you're still stuck. But yes the upside of hunter jump is to go back up if you fall.
---
You forgot /s
---
Umm how is this guardian still alive? Well of radiance around , I’m sure
---
Yeah. About what it took me for each character. Why I was shocked. I also did it when you needed 100 EAZ bosses
---
At reset today
---
That doesn’t mean that’s how destiny should or ever will work, it goes against the whole draw of the game and the very nature of the mmo genre.
---
Thanks, I recently just started playing again and had to look up when reset was
---
Ye
---
You got it dude! That's what we should do, but people always pick one thing to cry over. 
---
If it gets nerfed, they move on to the next thing. 
---
It wont end....EVER! -_-
---
Heart of inmost light for life baybe
---
It’s the crucible. Competitive would be more competitive that way in so many ways. 
---
The PvP element literally holds no mmo basis except that it’s in a mmo/action game. It’s purely derived from their PvP days making halo. 
---
It’s an action/mmo. Meaning, that it should be based more around balance, and the easiest way to balance loadouts was to always give fixed loadouts and see who really shines. 
---
But mmo. It’s not purely mmo. It’s mixed. Get out of your box.
---
He doesn't know about Forsaken
---
Alright,the damage resistance is nothing to scoff at seeing that it can tank shotgun hits and faster fire rate snipers on full health, and that requiring you to pack on seven resilience as well, but there are still genuine counters. I got a few points on this.
---
1. The move makes you slow as fuuuuuck, and if you throw the thing wrong, it can make a flashy boom and hit jack squat. Anyone with a general awareness of this can out maneuver the warlock, and then shotgun+punch or use a rapid fire frame and pop twice. It's exceedingly simple.
---
2. Harder hitting snipers can still pop warlocks. They're especially weak to harder snipers since they're trotting around on the ground just begging to be head shot.
---
And, finally let's put on the point that this an exotic propping it up for a slew of other exotics that put a warlock into a very hard set, very predictable playstyle. Supernova is at best a corner zoning tool just like Shoulder Charge, and anybody with extended time with  it will realize this immediately.
---
Honestly, the rare moments I play Titan, I use synthoceps because I don't have practice with OEM, and I'm spoiled by the lunge range.
---
 Agh bombs cause UTIs’
---
What doesn't make sense? PvP players pride themselves on their stats and padding their stats give them validation. Just like a PvE player may have 100 raid clears or all 40 Sleeper Nodes. 
---
Other than Unbroken, there is no other carrot to chase, so stat padding is the way out.
---
Well, someday, somewhere, someone will take  them up on the offer...
---
i want a swat game mode
---
Nah on Holy Spirit
---
They extended it there's still weeks yet bungie released the date, just a heads up
---
Cool. no actual points again. and you're lying. nice.
---
Keys and packages disappear when solstice ends, in like an hour
---
I would recommend the wendigo as opposed to the swarm for your play-stile, 
---
it’s a grenade launcher as well but the pinnacle vanguard weapon for this season. Even though the swarm does more damage when all rounds are fired at once this amount of damage is only really needed for raid bosses. 
---
The wendigo also goes with the play-stile of the wave splitter as it incentives picking up orbs of light for higher damage rounds
---
It was that map with the fallen ketch/servitor. There's only one sect where a pulse is viable and they had that part locked down most of the game.
---
***OOwOO***
---
That looks awesome
---
Went in recently to finish Legen of Acrius and boy do I wish every raid had an opening like Leviathan
---
They only have 2 or 3 spots they spawn, and 90% of the time it’s where you aren’t, and where the ads aren’t. You still have to verify, but you have a good idea where they are coming from. The EDZ map is hardest because it’s either beach or trees.
---
I'm not criticizing your gameplay. I understand games like that, but sometimes you need to switch to a special and down that guy to show who is boss.
---
These can give you more pieces of the solstice armor. In shadowkeep, we'll get armor 2.0, and some mids will be tied to armor element AFAIK, so in theory keeping these I can get another element I hope. But I've opened them all already
---
Titan or edz public event plus area bounties
---
I got a similar one with RH and multikill clip. Such an underrated gun can’t wait for scouts to be buffed
---
That's a dirty clip. Take my upvote.
---
Woah, you’re right. 
---
I titan with thunder crash could have easily handled it... even a warlock with a well placed nova bomb...
---
You can do it!
---
Nope, the MMXIX title only requires you to Masterwork *one piece* of Majestic Solstice armor.
---
Thanks :)
---
Moments of Triumph runs through I think September 17th.
---
Solstice of Heroes ends today, unless I've missed something.
---
Don't break down Transfiguration from LW if you get curated. Outlaw + Explosive rounds stagger enemies well.
---
I now want to purchase this and a chalice and pose in my bathtub. Would such a thing be allowed in this sub?
---
Nice Jev reference
---
I truly, genuinely thought I was the only one. Failsafe is best waifu
---
DIO!!!!! FIGHT ME!!!
---
Didn’t want change, just wanted to state an idea, without an argument.
---
the dev team has been swamped trying to keep the pace that they promised us for the last year with PvE content so they’ve neglected rolling out any major crucible changes.  supposedly those sweeping changes will be coming with season of the undying/shadowkeep.  skill based matchmaking is coming back as opposed to connection based as well as a solo-queue exclusive playlist that rewards glory.  i hear they’re also going to shift back to almost exclusively 3v3 and 6v6 game types.  One can only hope the crucible shapes up the way we all want it to.
---
Its based in glory points no? Usually everyone is near the same glory level. unless you gave a fireteam, then its based on the highest point total
---
Shall you partake?
---
Me as well, this is something that has to happen.
---
That makes it all the more fun when you kill them with an off brand loadout.
---
Its fun ro watch puny hunters try to outrun a gasbomb with 10 mobility and stompies
---
I really considered coming back during Solstice, but none of my clan plays anymore and I’m pretty far behind. I’m basically a blueberry all over again.
---
This is the internet 😂
---
Let’s keep our fingers crossed
---
Yes, the cross save is very seemless from my experience. Your Xbox characters will be on PS4 at their light level, with the right gear, etc. I also grabbed the Destiny 2 app on my phone to help with inventory stuff when I’m moving between PC and Xbox, as on PC I like hand cannons and the Forsaken Bows, but my accuracy on Xbox is horrible, so when I swap, I just swap the stuff, otherwise the stuff on PC would be on the Xbox.
---
Just one set of legendary and one masterworked
---
We give him the perfect paradox shotgun
---
That'd be me
---
Smells like a... snitch!
---
I’m 30. And it is fun to not let my inner child die and rot away. I play video games to have fun, not be some sweatlord tryhard.
---
Brother Moons from Dead space 3.
---
Hmm, maybe that's not a good thing...
---
I play all classes and main hunters in high rank comp. OEM and bottom tree striker are outliers for titans and make them arguably the strongest class atm, but that doesn't mean the entire titan kit is OP, nor does it mean that hunters and warlocks don't have anything OP on theirs.
---
Complain for change, but don't forget to adapt and play to your classes' strenghts. You'll find that every class has something extremely strong(OP), just not as good as OEM.
---
3.0?
---
Probably not. My bet is casuals doing iron banner over comp.
---
Do they hammer them down
---
My guess is that it doesn't exist
---
It was the bomb
---
And why do you say that?
---
How long did it take you?
---
The colours look way too disproportionate and like it's been photoshopped
---
That cut scene is one of the best on BOTH Destiny games.
---
Hate to say it bill, but it’s not. I do have a shader on that rose that makes it look like that.
---
And I was expecting you to rocket that hunter and take yourself out.
---
🤷🏻‍♂️😅👍🏻👋🏻
---
if sumoon you is a Shadowkeep pun i wanna hand in my resignation letter Arad i swear to god
---
Sorry man, don't worry there'll be tons of nice armor in Shadowkeep!
---
I guess it would be better without tracking but a bit faster?
---
I wish
---
I have no clue in that case
---
What's the shader you're using?
---
About you saying it’s disproportionate, I’d recommend putting a shader on the rose and seeing where the colors change and what they cover. You should see that it is exactly the same
---
that better be a typo
---
**ThAnOs TuB**
---
Nebula rose?
---
That’s the question
---
I don't have rose or I'd give it a try
---
Cool. Buy Mario’s Dance Party or something more your maturity level. This is an MMO first person shooter...
---
Yes, you pulled an all nighter for this.
---
Sorry, but you pulled an all nighter for nothing then.  To be fair, there were tons of posts warning everyone.
---
Nope
---
12 hours is pussy hours
---
lol
---
Yeah, against three Titans running OEM and probably using bottom tree FoH. Please tell me more about Truth.
---
No it wont. Not this years set
---
Destiny 2 companion is the official app, great for the forums, lfg and checking any news from bungie. For loot management the community apps are better. I personally use ishtar commander, great for moving items between characters and vault, load outs so you can auto equip full weapon sets onto a character as long as you are in orbit or the tower.
---
You look like an Amsel in distress. Oh wait, let me give you this D.
---
The picture is what my armor progress was at right at the end of the event, and now I feel like I wasted all that time for nothing
---
Same feeling as if my save data was corrupted and there goes all my progress.
---
All 3.
---
Ahhh, but thats whats I appreciates about you guardian.
---
I did every blue step(for my hunter) last sunday and it took me from 9am to 1pm.
---
How did it take you so long?
---
Little light is the best one
---
You might be right, as I admitted right before you posted this (you were probably already typing this as I pushed the "reply" button). How can you be so sure though? I played quite a bit of competitive in the past but this is the first time I paid this much attention to the order in which things happen. I tried playing it slowly but even then it's hard to tell for sure.
---
But you just said above that you have a shader on your Rose that makes it look like this.  If you have it, what's it called?  I'm unable to look in your inventory for you.
---
Well you’ll be able to put the green armor or blue armor via universal ormanents, if thats what you are asking
---
"great for forums"
---
Why in tarnation would you want to see the forums
---
Is that *really* what you appreciate about me, Squirrelly Calus?
---
Well it ain’t Barney the purple dinosaur
---
What war? he already decimated the competition.
---
Watermelon?
---
It actually wasn't THAT bad. The worst part was the gambit completions.. which promoted people to simply join and just afk
---
* Rezzes you when you die
---
* Heals you when you get low on health

* Keeps all your armor and weapons in transmat space so SSD users can hot swap exotics mid PVP
---
You switch these around right now.
---
I’m plenty nice to those I need to be. I do not have to be nice to anyone making assumptions. 
---
Don’t cast stones from your glass house 🤯
---
Until shadowkeep
---
The leg armor is being sold the last week of the season
---
So on everything I have atm I'm sorted for specs to have a good experience on pc?
---
Agreed
---
Yep.
---
Normally I'm not into watching videos or highlight reels, but for the single fact that you used those smooth transitions and there's not a ton of jarring jumps between clips and cartoons and graphics and effects giving me a seizure, I really liked this one. +1 dude.
---
Do all of you idioms come with emojis?
---
At least one of those game modes is being removed from the list.
---
Yay.
---
It's great the way it is, no spastic jumps from clip to clip that give the viewer motion sickness. It's smooth, not slow. Or at least that's my personal  opinion.
---
Do you have anymore assumptions? I figured every time you made one I’d use one. Eye for an eye and all.
---
At a high level, I don't disagree with you. I'm more interested in which one is better for a healthy player base.  Both sides say the other kills the crucible player base. I've always wanted to see what happens if players have a choice between the 2. Which playlist will be more active?
---
Bungie: Pinnacle weapons require kills in the comp playlist!  
---
Bungie's matchmaking: eight straight games of countdown.
---
i did all my 3 in a week
---
i am not sane anymore
---
Same with Handheld Supernova
---
You know it's bad when you have two "signal symbols" on the top bar....
---
k, thanks
---
I’m probably gonna die a sad sack of shit, knowing I can probably never afford one of these...
---
What primary are you using?
---
Some of those transitions were clean too. I liked the hunter dodge to a new clip.
---
SBMM. There are more bad players than good ones. However, punishing the players who are the best and most dedicated with a unenjoyable crucible experience is not the way to go if you ask me.
---
Pump Crucible full of rewards. Make as many people play it for the loot as possible. The average players will enjoy it, the good players will enjoy it, the bottom wont, but they were never going to anyway.
---
goodbye all of my 10 light armor
---
I love you.
---
Silence brand
---
It's like they want you to buy more silver :P
---
I have issues getting the right shade of yellow for bone, a lot of layering and trial and error
---
Hold the fuck up tho, cbd bath salts? I'm gonna have to try that
---
Bottom tree Arcstrider dodge is extremely difficult to hit and has damage resistance.
---
The modifiers do the trick - it feels good to overcome the fight by adapting and changing gear and tactics. Really enjoyed the challenge with the casual buds (we’re maybe the definition of casual players, one character (2 left behind around warmind)).
---
A pvp mode with no exotic restriction would be so good.

Pretty common in-game currency tactic: make things cost just a little more than what comes in a currency pack to make people buy another pack and spend more money on the game. Super frustrating, and a lot of times, you'll never zero-out your in game currency balance.
---
The Vigilance Wing with the "Vigil for Saint-14" ornament
---
Nice, same as that I'm pretty casual but put the work in. Having cross save go live a week before solstice ended sucked but had time to do 1/2.
---
Alright. Nice clip my fellow warlock.
---
Sometimes you gotta pick up danger and walk around with it.
---
Yeah I might was well buy the pack that comes with 6000 silver because I’m going to be wasting money buying these 500 silver ones all the time for small purchases like the Queens Cobra ornament.
---
You had 4 weeks...
---
I can be anything you wish, oh Dregen mine
---
I keep hearing certain items get removed from eververse after a while or can’t be purchased for bright dust
---
Me &amp; striker last alive and I ran away &amp; killed him
---
Its a competition on what’s more OP. Relax Mr. Chaperone Spectral Bladey guy probably. You also don’t get to see the entire enemy team with OEM
---
They are mostly 3s and low light levels. I can understand the bounties. Though pretty sure they are all new to the game.
---
Is this the week they made the Mountaintop quest and the spare rasion grind easier?
---
Give that man some figure skates
---
I hate a cluttered inv, to a fault
---
Crucible is trash, OEM titans are garbage men.
---
I know right? Those people are so stupid. Not devoting every waking hour of their day to destiny? Having commitments like work and family? The audacity of them.
---
Do you think the flight times to the tower will increase when we leave the eu?
---
Let’s be honest here all people ever want from warlocks in raids is to use well any way, it’s effective but gets boring only being able to use it
---
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be
---
Could be alts. But anyway, my point is that there are a ton of resources and guides available to new players. This post probably isn't going to reach them. Again, no offense, I'm just kind of a matter-of-fact guy.
---
To be honest I find it appears high levels who just dont bother. Any low lighters I have seen are keen to.try and pick it up quick.
---
By far.
---
\*Or aren't aware they *can* be activated.
---
Good question, but one that I am unsure about...
---
I was originally just going to show my friends, so I didn't care about the quality. Also, I was very very mad, so I wasn't thinking clearly. Sorry if it's bad.
---
This doesnt do it justice at all.
---
If you wanna get the real d1 experience, check BADASS GAMING's recap of each year of destiny 1. It really shows the good, the bad, the ugly, and the unforgettable.
---
If you didn't finish and masterwork at least one set of armor, you're out of luck until they (maybe) change the requirements next season.  If you need a crucible/gambit/vanguard pinnacle weapon for the badge you've got until the end of the season.
---
Yeah, except this is from Bungie.
---
And why can’t we teleport other ms as a Warlock??
---
Whyd you pay real money for the ornament and then not finish it....
---
Mine's the opposite. Playing around with orbs and not using them correctly. While others are trying and them just not getting it.
---
*Slaps in warlock*
---
This is a cursed sub if I ever seen one
---
this is legit like the only way I can have fun with pvp full ape
---
I’m ready for part two when he lets go and goes face first into a pole and is KO’d
---
RSOW fires 4 bullets instead of 3. It’s better for majors but kicks to the left without a mod. Swift ride would be good for pvp.
---
This ! Hh supernova is your best friend in iron banner.
---
yea it does i’m pretty sure
---
I see
---
Ok I figured but wanted to make sure
---
oh man, I loved solstice rumble. One time I loaded into game WITHOUT any bots and I've never felt more BETRAYED.
---
Which I agree with, I was just adding on as well.
---
That super has to have some sort of drawback to it. It's basically an infinite ranged one shot. Not to mention the absurd aim assist that comes with it. Roaming supers are like striker titans need to be more tanky because they're out in the open and within melee distance, so they're risking more. You can't seriously expect GG to be *actually* invincible, can you?
---
I always save my blade barrage just to shut down a Titan super ;)
---
And I’m thinking arc web grenades will be fun to toss in zones.
---
I keep my mobility high cause I hate feeling like a snail with a limp while scooped down and peek shooting.
---
You're confusing panic with a tactical counter super my friend. 😉
---
And sparrow horns!! It’s just not the same tailing a teammate and having to vocally meep at them.
---
The world may never know..
---
I enjoy OEM simply because it let's me play destiny like it's doom.
---
Good boy
---
Thats true. I mainly use hh supernova to counter all the rushing titans lol.
---
He hit you with the substitution jutsu

I mean you could also get a team together. But instead you’re just complaining.
---
Same gotta get the pants
---
Maybe they're all friends and just want to have fun while also being decent players.
---
Yeah but it's really easy to miss your blade barrage or throw it into a wall because of the animation. The problem is roaming supers and how hard it can be to stop them. Especially with striker Titans getting heals and more ult duration with every kill they get. 
---
I shouldn't get killed by a Titan, spawn across the map and have the same Titan still in the same super take me out again. 
---
Getting a good blade barrage off when 3 people are in a hallway is in no way equivalent to what roaming supers are doing man.
---
yeah they get cocky and you already know they are coming
---
(Knuckles "OH NO" here)
---
Thats kinda what I figured.  I do like this game and have been with it since original launch but a lot of the end game content just confuses me and when there's no story involved it's hard for me to push through. Im big on story content for most games.
---
You poor soul...
---
Helpful Tip:
---
When doing the Heroic for the "Destroy the Gate Lord" public event, LET THE GATE LORD LIVE UNTIL AFTER REMOVING HIS SHIELD TWICE.
---
I've seen the public event REACH Heroic multiple times, but the event turns back to a normal public event if the Gate Lord dies before its shield disappears a 2nd time. 
---
So to fix this, you'll need to do the process you did before which is eliminating the Gatekeepers at one side. Depends on which side you finished first (iirc). Then, HOLD BACK instead of going all Rambo or whatever because you can kill it before it brings its shield back up again but that's exactly what'll set the public event back to normal instead of heroic. Take out the 2nd Gatekeeper and take out the Gate Lord's shield a 2nd time, and then is when you can blow it to hell.
---
What? CryoPods can go heroic? /s
---

---
Except OEM is like wearing several exotics at once.
---
Just PvE, mostly. PvP is more based on the meta than anything else, since power level advantages are ignored for quickplay and rumble and the rotating playlist
---
*skill*
---
Ah okay. Thank you!
---
Im getting some kind of never-before discovered skin condition just by looking at this.
---
I guess you are right!  I've actually never tried my own 'strategy' ...
---
oh, and I do agree with your post in the first place
---
You’ve checked all your bounties and the tower to see if you need to talk to someone etc?
---
You are a good man. Thank you.
---
Better off buying the 10$ pack for the bigger bonus
---
Absolutely amazing, Especially the D1 Parts
---
Me and my friend have tried getting them started the past few days with no luck..we got maybe one other guy to join us while everyone else just sorta stared
---
What’s the fun in winning if it’s not a contest?
---
&gt; it should be something that you want to do instead of being just another chore
---
Exactly. Anytime I bring this up though people just downvote, or point to another game that is even more of a grind and say it's not that bad compared to that.
---
Rampage kept stacking also. Rampage basically gives extra range to shotguns.
---
You got greedy bro. Let that recovery kick in.
---
It's also farmeable from the Menagerie, pick range masterwork, almost half of its perks are perfectly good for PVP
---
Is it for this week?
---
You have to get the fallen transponder and do all the quest steps for that. Then you have to meet up with the fallen captain at the farm. The zero hour mission is only hard if you don’t know your way around the maze. Just get an experienced fire team and you’ll be fine.
---
I’ve got hundreds of hours in this game and didn’t even know you could do that for the Gate Lord on Mercury.
---
Yep. Don’t have to open chest, comes as a drop from boss
---
I get stuck with hunters who all feel the need to run blade barrage when there’s no tether or well or bubble
