Because the damage off tether is shared between the targets, if you hit one with a GL and the other dies from shared damage, it's not a GL kill it's a "kill from tether damage"

I‚Äôve found that it was triggered by emoting when the previous round ends,

Solo to 3k+ glory. Idk what you mean reward teamwork man. Team? What's that? Just carry your team like a goddamn semi truck. Or you know, have friends unlike me :(

You can never have to many 'splodes, but a neutral game buff would be dope.

Give it another month and you won't be. Especially doing breakneck. Source: Player who got Forsaken in February and had the exact same mindset as you.

Cross save is not currently available, but it will be when the new dlc comes out in September, for now I would recommend playing on Xbox and getting all your characters leveled up if you want to play the new dlc when it comes out, and then make the switch to PC when the cross save feature comes out
---
Has to be same gear set
---
Was doing the Inverted Spire strike in playlists last night, doing this and the ability kills one. Everything was going great, not even close to dying yet, having a good time. Get to the point where you take the last engine thing across the gap and have to jump to not almost break your legs and die after. Game decided it wasn't okay for the quest to be completed. Big orange barrier came up and all of us feel into the gap and died. Always thought it'd be the blueberries who'd sabotage me and not the game itself.
---
Just get the collection
---
I cheesed 50 tributes, hopped into my main character and got the bad juju and then the catalyst
---
##make Meat Mallet better
---
Ah but this is where I rule above you mortals because first try god roll
---
Does it still work?
---
I want a meatball enthusiast title now
---
I too suck at PVP.
---
I have the quest but that mission :%
---
Zzephiris has your order. ETA: 22 min.
---
The whole game with all dlcs is 40 dollars so i think its worth it right now
---
Even better: Nightmare-Cayde boss fight and Uldren saves us from him.
---
Petra's is a non self-proclaimed keeper though.
---
It actually says in the lore we kill cayde seven
---
This isn't an LFG sub.

---
yeah but i like seeing 2 eyes...
---
False, calus's psions wrote that. They're "prophecies to come". Those lore entries are basically fan fic
---
Hmm okay true but say I‚Äôm cheap lol do I have to buy any DLCs? Per the post.
---
Unlike Eris' fanclub...
---
True but it means that ideally that would happen if we were to side with calus and become his dearth Vader
---
Ideally to calus and the psions
---
Don‚Äôt care I got it you didn‚Äôt get it
---
It says strike 
---
They are ESAY BOI
---
oh yeah i dont recommend touching that stuff...
---
No. Buy forsaken and you get all the past content. Buying shadowkeep only gives you shadowkeep
---
Fuck so I gotta drop a 100 bucks!
---
You only need to spend 70.
---
There are actually 2 ways you can get past them without dying, but you can't use your sparrow and it's only at the long stretch of 4 railroad tracks. The easiest yet terrifying one is just running on the tracks while hugging the middle safe area.
---
Get that stuff off my map
---
Well if you want extra end game content i would say so. But the base 20 dollar one has the base story, curse of osirus, warmind and forsaken. The annual pass is just the 3 dlcs after forsaken
---
Calus themed items are those that come from activities on the Leviathan. Skyburner's Oath is a random drop from anywhere in the game, so it isn't Calus themed, though it is cabal themed. [A list someone made.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/cbbuhf/calusthemed_weapons_and_what_counts/)
---
Or you can wait till september when the base game and the first 2 expansions go free-to-play
---
As a casual. I hate you. As someone who played world of Warcraft from beta to wotlk, well played.
---
60 for shadowkeep 40 for forsaken

Ahhh okay, thanks for the help man. All I needed. :D

Technically he is superior if he had all the mats to do it.
---
It's okay. It's one of only 2 high impact LMGs in the game and can roll with perks like rampage or surrounded and no distractions, but overall the raid one is much better.

Im still gonna, screw the tribute hall

You'd just get a duplicate of one you own. You can buy it on your Hunter or Titan if you have them to finish out their collections
---
To be up-to-date with the community you will need to buy the DLCs. 
---
In September the base game, Curse of Osiris, and Warmind will be free
---
You will still need to buy Shadowkeep, Forsaken, and both the Y2 and Y3 Annual Pass to have access to everything.
---
The hell is going on with the cloak and helmet. It makes me uncomfortable
---
I was at 49/50 and then finished the warden of nothing strike and screwing around jumped off the platform as I always do.

It is but what solo que in the right mind is loading up like "yeah with zero communication we bout to get this bread and get this triumph"

As much as I wish this were true, the numbered iterations come from how many times their memory has been defragged in the deep stone crypt, not from them dying and being rebuilt.
---
Wrong week. Gotta do it during high curse week (when Petra is in Rheasilvia).

Do it again next week.

I dont have my helmet on.

It doesn't work with well but when you have phoenix protocol it works for some reason, makes it buffed to pre nerf levels tbh

Oh, thanks. Is that nezt week or??
---
Could be DDoS... which means some brat on the other team is an edgy loser.

That should be perfectly illegal, but with teams of randoms, it‚Äôs hard (read: practically impossible) to pinpoint the culprit.

I used the drang/sturm set up for a while and it was fun even masterworked them both then I got forsaken.

Lucky was using and lying buttwipe for his own financial and personal gain, and even to this day is still manipulating the community and bw, such as creating a go fund me to pay for his court costs, which it‚Äôs all bullshit

I think it's better than D1 but they handle and feel the same.
---
Shaxx's pride
---
That's true, however even with a base, non-masterworked, weapon, like the go figure it takes around 55-60 kills to get full super energy which isnt to much better
---
Gambit is a 50/50 lost cause as a solo player. I burst through the 3 Gambit triumphs solo just to get it out of the dam way.
---
It‚Äôs just the way catalyst work now, you can‚Äôt equip until objectives are complete. Outbreak perfected was the same.
---
That‚Äôs the virgin media promo 
---
And you can buy that sparrow in-game
---
He has a cabal daughter so it‚Äôs be weird if he wasn‚Äôt cabal at least at one point
---
It's so hard being a solo player...clan is online, but not as active until Shadowkeep drops.
---
Season of Poverty
---
So what you're telling me is that he has to go and finish 45 out of 50 triumphants to equip the catalyst.   Even though he has the catalyst because of the cheese.
---
Its much better in d1 in the super regen category, its like 15-20 kills or so if I remember correctly to get to max super
---
Someone definitely could have just called to trade hands with you on the spot
---
I just hit 82,000 triumph score today and I'm a solo player. You can do it!!!

---
No, I‚Äôm saying he has to complete the catalyst objectives (kill enemies I believe) be fore he can equip. Essentially you don‚Äôt equip the catalyst until you complete the actual catalyst objective.

 OK got you thank you very much.

Wow an exotic that lets you oneshot all supers hmmmmm completely balanced

yeah i went to the dreaming city and benedict isn‚Äôt there/his quest doesn‚Äôt come up.

need to check that

If he had a sniper on he could have headshot that super. It has the second lowest resilience out of all supers. Either way it‚Äôs that spectral blades fault for popping it off right next to the enemy.

If the person who casted the well of radiance has the exotics lunafactions on, it‚Äôll reload your gun. If he doesn‚Äôt have then equipped then ur guns won‚Äôt reload by themselves

I wouldn‚Äôt pay for it at all. I would look on any LFG site, for a mountain top lobby. If you get a good rhythm you can easily get it done.
---
Exactly...first, hardwired is the best option, always...but if you have no choice but WiFi, either open the proper ports, or as he says...a DMZ (in your actual modem settings accessed via html on your PC.  
---
On your modem...goto:  http://192.168.2.1
---
First goto Settings/Network/Network Status on the console.  Jot down the Local IP Address listed (your console's IP).  You'll need this shortly.
---
The login and password for your modem/router should be (if you've never done this before or didn't set them through your provider): 'admin', 'admin' (sometimes is actually 'password').  Type them exactly as what's above in quotes.  No upper case, etc.  If you know it, then you know it...but regardless, once you're in:
---
Look somewhere under Security or Management depending on provider for DMZ (might say Demilitarized Zone), and while not likely, if those options are absent, all might be in the same tab/section as Port Forwarding.  Once here, choose the option to turn that on and/or 'add a device/address'.  This is where you type in your console's EXACT IP Address.  Be very careful not to accidentally enter your PCs IP, even firewalled...very, very exposed.  However, consoles deal with this differently through their services..so don't worry.
---
Once you've done all this, reboot your console and goto Settings/Network/Check Network...then goto Network Status again and for one, whether it did before or not, if you followed above carefully...your NAT Type should say 'Open'.  If it doesn't, something wasn't done right or there's more to your issue.  
---
This will allow your console packet flow to accept more incoming, so even dropped packets won't affect you the majority of the time (sometimes other network activity can cause anomalies).
---
Sorry for going on...but best advice I could give.
---
Tried that too, didn't work out.
---
Hopefully not but we'll have to wait and find out
---
I like the Warmind exotic sparrow.
---
I have 57 and everything worked for me. No you won't get banned for it
---
So your saying to counter I problem that shouldn't exist I need 3 other people and might get lucky. And meta shouldn't mean broken guns, it should mean guns that are somewhat more effective or popular than others. And my internet is good in every application or game other than Destiny 2.
---
The reason I asked as well is that I honestly don‚Äôt have the time or resources (really low amount of planet materials and legendary shards) to do this quest the legit way. I work a lot so it would take me a LONG ass time.
---
Content wise, I agree
---
I‚Äôm a returning player and still on that grind for this.
---
Prepare for the waves of Hunters turning the subject into ‚ÄúDoWn TrEe StRiKeR tItEnS aRe MoRe ScArY‚Äù 
---
It‚Äôs just a meme folks, chill lol
---
The... Exotic Arsenal? Think that's it. The one where you need Whisper, Outbreak and Juju?
---
So what got me through this easiest was not going for kills, but what I called "tagging" the enemy. Instead of engaging in a gunfight and dying, just shoot someone your teammate is already fighting then run
---
I'm trying to figure this out so bear with me, you are moving to pc from console question is do you have to buy forsaken bundle again to play on pc?
---
Not really get lucky it depends on your glory and you have to bear in mind that just cause someone has recluse (for example) doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre higher glory it could mean that got it in another season or have dropped while doing another quest. I thought my internet was fine as well I was getting dc‚Äôd multiple times in a 2 hour session till I switched to a wired connection and haven‚Äôt had any issue since. As for broken weapons, balancing is hard if you were a game dev you would know this, if a guns so broken then why don‚Äôt you use it to win, because your not scummy? Then you can‚Äôt complain about others using just find ways to counter said weapons I lot of them have drawbacks.
---
Oh i know The exclusive strikes is what I got upset about
---
Yeaa thanks
---
F
---
You can even see the "lightning" effects in the video.
---
At 850k now lmao
---
I also had a bug where the gun would turn invisible, like it was loading in...
---
What do you mean "left"?
---
All I can offer is that I have that perk on my Seal of Troika shell. I checked on my companion app but can‚Äôt get the perks to show. But I definitely have it on there
---
I got crucible vanguard and dreaming city scanner on fire victorious shell from best of year one engrams, as well as on Copperhead from season six. But I think most can roll with it you just need to get lucky

just the super. neutral game is insanely good for gambit.

Congrats man! Finally got mine yesterday as well, same tactic (spent all last week grinding like nuts in normal QP!). To celebrate I suggest grabbing a Titan rally barricade/LunaRift and spamming the thing into anything and everything!

the amount of people not doing this and then complaining about difficulty or just being bad is too damn high
---
nah, mine is Dreaming Spectrum and the middle part isn't that brown I think
---
I may be wrong but doesn't it require them to be in the dreaming city? If so the easiest way was to wait for the enemies to go against each other outside the blind well entrance and just farm them there.
---
Yes, the complete collection is the base game, both year 1 expansions, forsaken, and the current annual pass. You will still need to buy shadowkeep when d2 switches to steam but you will NOT need to rebuy any current dlcs/seasons on steam. Also if you want a clan on pc to help you get started you can join mine, It's small but everyone is really active and helpful.

Just want to clarify it's not completing a bounty but instead just opening the pursuits tab for a few seconds. A lot of people have been confused because of the original thread talking about the fix having poor wording.
---
Blind well

lol hope u get suspended again.

That was in D1

Yes, that is correct!

No it's not

**‚ÄùALSO, THERE WILL BE A TON OF LOOT!‚Äù**
---
Alright, ty so much guys.
---
Happy cake day
---
When I was looking on steam, it did not say anything about forsaken or the forsaken: annual pass. The more expensive shadowkeep bundle says this:
---
&gt;Includes Destiny 2, Curse of Osiris, Warmind, Shadowkeep, Shadowkeep Pre-Order Pack and Shadowkeep Deluxe Pack
---
and thats a fact
---
I guess he was bored, all he does is yell at people when there is a Crucible match, otherwise he's just standing at The Tower... still sometimes yelling... eh, whatever, Shaxx can be secondary protagonist for all I care, but Cayde-6 was the main character of Destiny until he was killed. Tbh, I think the story died with Cayde, everything after is just endgame and more endgame...
---
Do you mean literally nothing? You're supposed to get glimmer, planet mats, a big chunk of xp, and then a blue or sometimes legendary item. This is normal.
---
I... I didn‚Äôt even think of that üòÜ
---
Thanks!
---
Funny how the 2 Titans in front have better armour than most of the sets available to us at the moment.

---
[Zavala bad.](https://i.imgflip.com/2k48t0.jpg?a434112)
---
Yeah picked that up from the TWAB last night.
---
There are a variety of exotics of varying ages that I use, or that I see recommended to others. Mainly DARCI, riskrunner, tractor cannon, and huckleberry. I think prometheus lens, borealis, and sturm are also good. 
---
Every exotic in the game is still currently acquire-able, though some in a different way than at release. Example: a couple of exotics, thunderlord and arbalest, were introduced to the game via a quest that was part of a holiday event. The quest went away when the holiday event did, but the guns are now in the random drop pool. 
---
&gt;Any hints or tips would be great. Feel like I've forgot everything.
---
A lot of things have changed. Treat this game as if it was new. Look around at all the menus and stuff to refamiliarize yourself, and whatever other things you would do if you were new.
---
There‚Äôs your first mistake. Cayde isn‚Äôt the main character. We are. (Which is why I think our character should speak more)
---
I think the secondary reason Cayde died (apart from his VA moving on to other projects) was because he felt like the only interesting character. Now, we have characters like Shaxx, the Drifter, Shin Malphur, and even Zavala in the spotlight because he‚Äôs gone. Not saying it‚Äôs a good thing, I still miss him, but it‚Äôs a silver lining.
---
And another thing about shaxx. In the flavor text for the Revoker quest, he states the value of being patient and waiting for the opportune moment, practically the opposite of what titans are stereotyped as
---
Arbalest
---
Yeah I had a feeling that it would be a paid expansion.
---
&gt;it's why others don't leave warframe
---
And why 95% of the player population is vets and no new people actually stick around nowadays past MR2-3 and most are MR16+
---
And what is the unfair advantage? Having an extra exotic and a couple of triumphs along with a catalyst, the gun is good but not gamebreaking, if others got it early so what, it doesn't affect anyone else at all
---
btw happy spotify cheese day :)

yes because a stranger to their people giving judgement on their prince is totally more palatable than one of their own, who is the commander of the soldier that was killed and an individual who has lived for much longer than us to build up more relationships.

An article said they were gonna run towards the base like the characters from Naruto...so that's probably why they thought the people that made the event on FB were weebs.

No I wont, you idiot, I'm unbroken and ik how crucible works 80% of the time. You don't use a Proelium with low charge rate in Crucible because of its impact, you don't use Shotguns like Threat Level because their pellet spread is too high.

Don't come at me and say that, because you have no idea what you're talking about.

Ok thank you for the answer, but isn‚Äôt the fated engram supposed to lock on the character if I have all obtainable exotics?

No it doesn‚Äôt lock

Is that a problem or something?

Seems easy enough to gather who you meant to reply to anyway. I try to just ignore that one on here. The bitter and childish comments from that one aren't worth dwelling on.

Would you lose it every time they release a new seal, until you‚Äôve earned them all again? That would be a troll move I could get behind :P
---
Read in a thread last night that it happens more likely if you change armor or weapons.
---
They didn't remove the Dredgen or Chrinici Seal even though there's more lore and more Gambit triumphs.
---
They finna get strafe run brrrt brrrt
---
Aw man I started it like the second it came out lol. O well. Thanks anyways
---
Yeah, I also realised that. And so I went to remove the post, but it seems as though it hasn‚Äôt been removed. How do I remove posts on mobile?
---
Shit, you right, I was thinking of the other ufo sightings
---
I got this quest after reseting the valor rank, after a lot of matches in comp and quickplay. It's a random drop but I think it's from comp or crucible in general.
---
Because you‚Äôre the only one never meeting the top meta weapons in PvP. Your chances are probably higher dropping 10 exotics from 10 enemies than not seeing any snipers or hand cannons in crucible
---
If you watch closely, you can see the neurons in their tiny smooth brains misfiring.
---
This bug happened to me in a comp game. When I dropped down onto the map it was as if it was the middle of the night,  my ONLY saving grace was that my weapon scope highlighted enemies, or else I would have been playing by minimap alone
---
Nice.
---
You get the quest from resetting your valor rank in crucible. Not random.
---
‚ÄúIn a different life I would have killed him myself‚Äù - Zavala
---
Guys, this isn't even Ghaul. This is his short mentor dude.
---
Assume you would have if you have played since day 1 but I got it like many others at the end of the first competitive match played after resetting valor
---
Figured out how to delete posts
---
"So many"
---
Omolon sidearms are still strong
---
Le Monarque is good
---
Mida/Polaris are great on larger maps
---
Many SMGs are good
---
Arbalest is top tier in the right hands
---
Crucible is very balanced right now save for a few outliers and supers
---
&gt; if you guys want something that will melt in pvp
---
&gt;  I‚Äôve discovered that if you get a kill with your primary weapon Then have your friend but he was alumina
---
&gt;  you can just melt a boss
---
I have NEVER seen a boss in PvP. So I am completely lost.
---
Oh, and everyone knew Master of Arms and Lumina buff stacks. Thats like a "no, duh!" as people have been stacking Master of Arms with a Wells for 2 seasons already.
---
He IS a Hunter with NF so they can only be so selfless
---
It's the same on ps4 I switched weapons mid quuckplay match and was stuck with ghost weapons
---
Sorry I‚Äôm a bit slow in the head lol. I looked it up on YouTube and didn‚Äôt see anyone talking about so just thought I might say something just in case.
---
Ding dong your opinion is wrong
---
Imma quick spectral blades in there, get the irl outbreak perfected and dip
---
you need like 3-4 NF with the whole armor and wep set to get it done... 1 wep and 1 armor will slow you back...
---
Instead of make a post on reddit you could be grinding to get it faster, right? XD
---
First no petting in destiny 2, now missing cats. Bungie your free from activision, CHANGE THISS FOR THE LOVE OF SHAXX
---
I put the 1 wep and armor set for an example, I got 3 armors from the set, and 2 weapons, just asking for a clan mate
---
Guess what I've been doing for the past several months? *XD*
---
Where is this lol
---
The new thing is to kill yourself as you're placing the banner so you can place it upside down.
---
You can do it multiple times in one week, but you won't get anymore particulate. Its capped at 167 a week (including the puzzle). My friends and I did it twice in a day but alas, have to do it in 5 weeks playing it casual, or 3 weeks if you grind for the ship aswell.
---
You need 500 precision kills, and 500 particulate to masterwork it in case you didn't know exact numbers.
---
Wings are essential for skipping CoS second encounter, otherwise they are fun to use when messing around platforming with Worldline Zero.
---
Moons haunted
---
I feel like 5 times is too much. 3 is good is what it should be. I could also see the catalyst just needing like 500 precession and like 100 nanite kills
---
It's a blue smg
---
I meant should I do with the gunsmith materials. I put tribute hall is active for a time frame cause some people just don't know when something is posted
---
I don't know what you are talking about. What I posted here is directly from my discord server. Spider has updated every single day this week at the same time and I have posted the last 3 days here. They are all clearly different. 
---
Maybe your discord server didn't post it (your discord admin would be to blame there). But my discord server has posts for every day this week and there are no issues with his rotation. 
---
So I don't understand your issue, but there is no issue with Spider and his inventory. I have been using it every day this week for Tribute hall and I have seen 3 different inventories since Tuesday.
---
We are all equals, because we all play a great game. Regardless of what class. Destiny is great!
---
Yeeh! Threw out all stops to end my reign of terror to your team! üòÇ

u/ [NIGHTFURY-21](https://www.reddit.com/user/NIGHTFURY-21/) OP, no one is understanding what you're trying to say because you're not doing a good job articulating yourself.  You're giving people the assumption that you predict that all current armor will be defunct when Shadowkeep drops.    
---
People, the OP is trying to say that he hopes that all Year 2 armor will get the Armor 2.0 treatment that all armor Year 3 and beyond will be getting.  He's also more than likely hoping that all current armor will be transmog compatible.     
---
OP, I suggest elaborating next time so people know what you're talking about, because what you're saying isn't making much sense.
---
Ok. Sorry it looked the same from Wednesday to Thursday in your post but it's nearly identical. 
---
Yes, there was not a new post Thursday at 5 pm Pacific. Our admin said it was an issue on bungie's end then. Apparently our admin is not correct...
---
I don't get it. 
---
WHEN WILL THE LOW EFFORT POSTS STOP?!??!
---
Heck yeah! Also this is the most wholesome conversation i‚Äôve ever seen on the Destiny subreddit
---
He is using a radio DJ technique where you tuck your top lip in to not "pop" his P sounds when talking into a mic.  source: worked in radio

I'm asking why I kept getting killed by arunak in during the arkborn

Oh its not a bad idea I'm fine with how it is rn though.
---
Yeah it would be your admin, I am my discords admin and there have been no issues with the bot this last week. The bot that posts these has been spot on all week for my server.
---
Wednesday and Thursday are similar, but Glimmer takes a different material, and Simulation seeds replaced Dusklight Shards. 
---
So you can see they are different.
---
Yeah.  Turns out I had to talk to somebody but they weren‚Äôt marked the first time I figured it out
---
Check the game credits, I think they're in the options menu somewhere

I agree! Each class has its own way of being not so balanced hint why we take advantage of those skills or powers
---
Gladd should solo Area 51
---
The Human (Cabal?) Pop Filter! I love it!

They showed Year 2 armor in the vidoc.

If you checked the known issues list that is published by the developer, you would see this on it.....

Alright then, who has the time for that
---
*as everyone here starts talking about d1*
---
Damn.
---
Thanks for the info.
---
tf? of course its a glitch, the way shards work speed up your super regen the same way that mayhem already does, thus it stacks. if it just gave you a flat percentage over the timer then it would be balanced. you literally have infinite nigh uncounterable supers. btw that is the most generic excuse ever because its supposed to be a fun gamemode but only players who abuse this get to have fun in it while everyone else suffers for it. so thanks for that. try playing mayhem without shards, against someone who is using them, and tell me how that goes. idk if you remember but when they first added the new subclass blocks in forsaken, it took several months before bungie put mayhem as a playable gamemode and its because of shards. because they are aware that some people don't have any morals or compassion. so thanks dude.
---
No prob!
---
posting vids is fine as long as they are direct capture and d2 related, but if you're just trying to grow your channel then this is  self advertising
---
Easy way to get the needed Glimmer ;)
---
Thanks for the damage numbers, thought I was losing out a lot not having spike.
---
its not a bug thats for sure.
---
I'm not new, just ignorant
