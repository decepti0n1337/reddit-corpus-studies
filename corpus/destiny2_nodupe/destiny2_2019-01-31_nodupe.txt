My buddy's Prismatic Matrix looked like this too. Mine, on the other hand, had one or two of them checked off. I believe the facet I used yielded a clean, crisp purple sparrow.
---
---
---
I wish I could say I got it from the raid but I lack friends so I just opened the free chest and the weapon had it lol
---
Are you on PS4?
---
No pc

Ha!!!!! I agree...nay..... I VOW to only keep it Sexy on my next tip post!

Or more likely you are just a keyboard warrior safe behind the internet making stupid comments due to the insecurities you face in the home life, surfacing through video games ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Play slow, follow the group.  Try not to get frustrated, it takes time to find a groove.  
---
Not all maps are created equal.
---
Dont panic if you get killed, if you're like me and not that good at PvP find a decent weapon and stick to it.  It may take longer but you will get it done in about an hour or two.
---
Play quickplay
---
Gotcha. I need to finish the catalyst on PS4. Good luck tho. 
---
Gitfuked
---
You too
---
Why settle, get kill clip/ rampage orchid
---
I have an Outlaw/Dragonfly one that I want to put back into rotation. I enjoyed using it when it was weak. It should only feel even better.
---
Console player I bet
---
Oh ok thanks for tge info,  it helps out a lot.
---
Just watch out for that storm blanketing the northern US.
---
DO IT
---
Yes.  I know it‚Äôs a hip fire weapon, but what made it so fun in d1 was the fact that you could still ads effectively at close range.  On console the recoil is a bit much, on pc it‚Äôs no issue.  So yeah it‚Äôs totally more of a collectors item, don‚Äôt ever plan on using it in crucible or pve.
---
Stop playing Mayhem for that step.
---
Go into Quickplay. 
---
This isn't an LFG sub.
---
Rule 13.

We're caught in a paracausal loop where we both keep responding and neither is unable to stop.

What if I am a keyboard warrior, armed with the finest Logitech gear money can buy?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Or.. What if I'm at work and killing time before I take off for the day. What if I'm not a keyboard warrior, but an actual warrior, with a sword and some chain mail?
---
Sorry I made this on my phone :(
---
Sorry I forgot
---
Oof if there‚Äôs crying about that simple PvP objective on TLW I can only imagine first curse
---
Git Gud
---
No you plumhead,i mean ive seen you somewhere before *before* i posted that on r/pornhubcomments
---
Oh, huh. What sub u think it was
---
Completely agree. It‚Äôs total bullshit to gimp players intentionally. 
---
Last Word does require a different play style 
---
That roll doesn't even have high cal and the dude is on PC.
---
RIP you guys. Idk it feels like it was meant for hip fire and now it‚Äôs actually encouraged
---
I have no idea,it must have been a while back,i just had a bit of deja vu
---
I dont think he realized, no
---
what's the matter? Need to have the LAST WORD?
---
Huh thats wierd. I had the same thought
---
Iron strength the Iron Banner Shader
---
I have 4
---
Thanks, u/TheBlimp 
---
Same happened to me working on the Lunas quest. So frustrating getting wrecked by the gun that ideally no one you face has yet. Kicked myself for not doing it last season. 
---
I don't understand going all sweaty in quick play. Seems kinda douchy, but a team of lw isn't too bad since they probably just got the gun together and wanted to try it out. 
---
Well you made up stupid reasons for us being upset instead of, yknow, telling the truth or letting us speak for ourselves so...fuck yourself, liar
---
I don‚Äôt enjoy hand cannons and don‚Äôt enjoy crucible, but I got TLW and I love it in PvE...it‚Äôs just fun...and once you get used to it, it can be pretty deadly. 
---
‚úå
---
Hit a body shot with tatara gaze and then finished him with one clean shot with last word, felt so crispy 
---
Actually just saw a video the ADS one is now the faster killer
---
Go do the arsenal event by the time that‚Äôs done the ritual spawns that‚Äôs how mine worked
---
Better than Luna.
---
In Destiny 1, they worked essentially the same as other vendors like shax and Zavala, can level up and get gear from them whenever. Destiny 2 they had a similar system but only made it a limited event like iron banner, but the last one was months ago :/
---
Oh yeah. I do want the Ace of spades lol. That seems like it would be better in PVE. Of course the telesto finally dropped the day after nerf. Got my Ikelos shotty a day or 2 after a nerf lol 
---
BB is annoying, yes, but almost just as annoying is getting killed by a warp or sentinel, dying, then spawning into the same person killing me again. Usually happens three times before the guardian runs out of super energy. 
---
Imagine doing it as a hunter.. when we didn't have a void subclass.
---
And then you finally finish the quest and then it gets nerfed 2 weeks later.
---
That was me.
---
Ace would win a duel.
---
This post is in a terrible state
---
Top tier strats right here. They can kill you 100 times but if you dont kill them they wasted their exotic slot 100/10.
---
I rock my FWC emblem and wipe all my gear down with War Cult Rain, hoping for the day I'm allowed to cheese Lost Sectors again for some mediocre loot.
---
Seriously though, it was something to do that gave the tower and world a bit more identity if nothing else. I miss it.
---
1. Quest
---
2. Quest
---
3. Nice drop, congrats.  
---
6 shot for pvp or add clear
---
3 shot for big bois
---
I get using Lunas now and then (I haven't taken Luna off since I got it but it's still new and shiny and I'm getting used to it) but I see these guys all the time. If you got Not Forgotten you played so much (most likely with Lunas) that there is no way the novelty hasn't worn off. And having wardcliff on with a max range dust rock is a bit much. I usually run blast furnace and jotunn or I'll be running around with talon in my heavy slot and sniping. I just try and have fun in qp. I don't see the appeal of sweating in quick play. The point of sweaty load outs is competition. Stomping isn't fun for me
---
I just want the Dead Orbit shaders ;-;
---
I was like "Daaamn that's a lot of public events!" but then I went and checked my emblem and I've got 784 so I guess it's really not very many at all.
---
That's how math works, right?
---
Bye son mind how you go
---
Nope. Complete comment with no insult or anything to it. Just point out humor
---
That was my wallpaper on my xbox for some time.
---
?
---
That's a good idea but I can't stand to play quick play these days and won't even play it with my clan. It's become the comp playlist for people who aren't quite good enough to do well in the comp playlist. At least in my experience.
---
I'm just playing rumble like I normally do and not paying much attention to the quest. Every once in awhile I see I'm around 10%. Then the next time I look I'm at one or zero. I'm not good at stringing together kills. And too often a good player will just kill me over and over again. It is what it is I'm not too worried about it till iron banner comes around.
---
Exactly despite you not liking pvp you dedicated yourself because you wanted it dedication should always be rewarded not complaining. 
---
I just like him for the comedic relief. It's a nice change of pace with the universe in serious danger around every corner. Sometimes you can't help but laugh in the situation and I know people who would act the same way if you had the ability to be near immortal. If there are little repurcusions then why not make life more entertaining.
---
Thats a good mindset as well theres no rush just pace your self until you are ready
---
Any translator here?
---
I dismantled so many trusts because at the time
---
I didn‚Äôt use hand cannons and didn‚Äôt bother to look at what perks were good, and now I kick myself because I‚Äôm sure I threw away god rolls
---
It does need a buff. Not a big one but I would love to see a second exotic perk, not an op one, but at least a fun one.
---
I appreciate that you didn't read my full explanation and completely missed the point of what I was trying to say.
---
Would be really nice. 
---
Im pretty appreciative of that also mate, have a good one 
---
Just to see that moment:)? Joking right? Obviously you are joking.
---
Trails. Where you at??? 
---
Both are 500
---
I agree wholeheartedly. And for people who complain and feel like they deserve every exotic in the game I remind them that not long ago Bungie dropped a super easy quest on us to give everyone who had 15min to spare the Thunderlord, one of the best exotics in the game. And now they drop a quest that‚Äôs harder. It all evens out. 
---
You need to buy Foresaken to be up to date on all of the new story. You definitely should; it is *miles* better than the base game's story and has huge implications for the Destiny universe.
---
Thank you! I‚Äôll be working on it this weekend or whenever I can sit down and play
---
And then there is Kalli and the other Techwitch, SoTP in which most Ult's are useless against the boss outside of Nighthawk and Well and and any future Raids we will get.
---
As well as bullet-sponges like in the Forges missions, any activity who has increased enemy damage like a Nightfall with a matching singe to enemy snipers and many more. Supers aren't reliable against bosses outside of Gambit as most high tier bosses will have a health-pool far greater then any super can damage and then, you stand naked with a legendary heavy machine gun which is a very weak option. 
---
We simply don't have any strong heavy weapons in the legendary slot that can compete with Whisper, Sleeper and now Acrius since it now is the highest DPS weapon after the damage buff against high-tier bosses.
---
The Iron Banner roll from a couple weeks ago, steady rounds, snapshot, opening shot. It‚Äôs a monster üëå
---
Haven‚Äôt tried with the other 2 this time around, but I noticed today that the 3rd sentinel branch will block blade barrages. Regardless, I agree that endless tethers and blade barrages are incredibly rage inducing.
---
There are invisible platforms, you don‚Äôt jump up on the statue lol
---
My pulse also worked (though I had to abandon the bow) but they needed fallen kills. Its directly tied to the vex and bow.
---
alright lowkey, that gave me an idea
---
imagine this
---
Bumper cars... but with sparrows ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
I assume that you mean "uldren" may become the next hunter vanguard? Well you're wrong and here is why:
---
A. That guardian isn't Uldren, 2 completely separate people. Therefore this new baby guardian did NOT kill Cayde.
---
B. Cayde's dare that we hear is merely a fraction of the actual dare. Go back and play the mission next time it comes around. The line specifically begins with, "For any HUNTER, that kills me..." This is what we refer to as a qualifying statement, but the Dare is total encompassing what would have happened if a non-hunter killed him? There are aspects of the dare we dont know.
---
C. No one, and I mean NO ONE, would put a green, still-wet-behind-the-ears guardian become the LEADER of the hunters. It would be stupid, wrong, irresponsible, and outright dangerous.
---
In conclusion, this new guardian will Not be the next hunter vanguard, maybe at some point down the line but not next.
---
My bad, I had never seen it before in any videos or pictures.
---
I miss doing sparrow tricks, and the moon.
---
But did you throw enough grenades?
---
It‚Äôs also extremely helpful when wanting to avoid drop mag on the Luna‚Äôs howl.
---
I don't get why you would come to a Destiny 2 subreddit to tell a bunch of strangers that love Destiny 2 enough to come here, that you personally don't care for the game.
---
It shouldn't make any difference to you what game, book, movie, or music other people enjoy in the privacy of their own homes. It's weird.
---
No hate, just saying it doesn't make any sense. 
---
What‚Äôs really sucky about mayhem is all the losers who run tether this to ruin the fun
---
I hate the Sentinel's Banner Shield in Mayhem, you can literally have 6 blade barrage hunters come at you at the same time and they'll take no damage
---
Dude thank you! Nothing about the quest line felt like it belonged with TLW. It all felt related to Thorn, so I'd bet that it's not that far behind.
---
Thanks for the reply
---
Banner Shield too
---
If you see it on Titan, definitely go for that. Blueberries could initiate an EP on Mars which supersedes any incoming public events. 
---
Ah a true intellectual. Cayde would be proud
---
Did it first try but I knew what to do going in. 
---
Just go to the rig on Titan. Even if you don‚Äôt see it it might already be going on, if it‚Äôs not just wait for it. 
---
It happens, no biggie. Good of you to share what you found! 
---
Because as said by other commenters, you can't avoid it, can't kill them while in the animation, can't tank it with your own super, as it's a shutdown super.
---
Kindled Orchid: Why not both?
---
Yeah, I want to love the last word, but I lose some of my gunfights because the shots just aren‚Äôt hitting when I am sure they are on the enemy.
---
Yeah for the most part. Tbh my whole life is a wreck that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm posting memes on reddit lol. At least I‚Äôm not berating somebody on that same website
---
I‚Äôm allergic to cats and always feel like they‚Äôre secretly plotting my ‚Äúaccidental‚Äù death, but that‚Äôs one cute kitty. 
---
This worked for me after 3 bugged attempts! Thank you my friend!
---
*My profile picture usually describes my replies*
---
burden is ass in invades. the visual glitch completely fucks you up on your first couple seconds and then you're just gonna get flinched the fuck out with a hammerhead or something
---
What‚Äôs this?
---
laughs in black talon
---
yeah but like every other legendary sniper in the game uses special and ammo drops like candy. izanagi can one shot. darci is just a brick taking up your heavy slot for tlord or hammerhead
---
See you later space cowboy :(
---
I never understood why people who dont like the game come on to the games subreddit and complain about it thinking anyone else is going to agree with them.
---
Im seeing down votes but i dont see an issue with this..  LW is not an exclusive PvP weapon so why should people need to do shit they dont like for it... i got it in a few hours but i dont see why people should be forced to do shit they dont like for a weapon that isnt only a PvP weapon..  this is not a luna/NF this is not a mountain top.. those are wepons designed with PvP in mind.. also dont see y PvP players should be force to go into PvE to do shit either... for people that dont like PvP this is frustrating and down right disheartening... 
---
Thank you men, probably I will! 
---
Yeah I think so. I don‚Äôt play mayhem a lot so it might be due to the gamemode
---
I mean its pretty much a gun made for PvP so you have to expect that some of the steps towards such a weapon involve PvP. Just like whisper is pretty much a PvE gun and I would never think about bringing it into a PvP game. So naturally that quest involved an intricate PvE type quest. I honestly felt like they could of done more with the Last Word quest but that last mission mechanic was very cool.
---
They should make faction crucible. Dead orbit smashing everything. Just gotta watch out for those shnazzy FWC warlocks looking all fashionable and what not.
---
The name is strangely appropriate. Now all we need is more crucible.
---
Sorry, SORRY? It makes the meme even better!
---
Try it without any BA weapons or just without Le Monarque. 
---
He keeps telling me Redrix isn‚Äôt for losers lol, which I hadn‚Äôt heard before this week. 
---
I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if mayhem had its own lines though 
---
Enjoy both of them, have more hours on warframe but currently not enough stuff to grind for so on D2.  
---
Become Legend Guardian

Not trying to be negative nelly but based on the range of that engagement and the time it took to kill those guys, Pulses still are way better.
---
Got some other shoots from my expedition :

---
Thank you. You are the first person to talk about people having trouble with the quest for TLW and not stating that they suck and should get better or they don't deserve the gun. But I still think that it would have been much nicer to just have the step be something like 100 crucible kills (or along those lines). Essentially, something that could just be grinded out. It seems especially cruel to have the step detract from your total whenever you mess up (considering how easy that is to do as a terrible crucible player), and it is extremely disheartening when you see that total slip down as you get stomped by people who are better than you. It kind of ruins the fun and breaks your spirit.
---
lol you seem pretty salty that somebody has a different opinion on how to play the game then you 
---
It‚Äôs so much worse because I heard his voice as I read it.
---
A I M 
---
I had all the items except for the ornament as well.
---
This was definitely a marketing move by Bungie to get us to want it, and then buy the season pass.
---
And it worked, because I did just that today. Lol
---
I can't beat enkaar on pc. holy shit. after all this. sometimes I get him and die at the same time
---
Good luck! Don‚Äôt dive too deep üòÇüòÇ
---
Oh i just meant like meta wise
---
Like total # of kills across every player but yeah i goof'd the punchline
---
I think it does
---
 
---
He says that mayhem is when friends gather togehter and kill each other with thier light
---
üòÇüòÇ might end up like Eris and Ashen üòÇüòÇ
---
I have that same issue, but sometimes my kills and assists aren't being counted (for example, I spawn, get a kill and two assists, die, check my step, and have lost 1%)
---
Closer to failsafe!
---
Stronger, and more pleasurable than condoms.
---
I think I heard somewhere that the pipes in the head are where Cabal pump stuff to make the all rabbid.
---
So they might be a lot nicer if not for the Cabal!!
---
I found it easier to get kills with all of the extra PvE only people in there. 
---
The pornhub spam on reddit is out of control
---
Mayhem has been good for getting blood for blood and best served in crucible. Quick matches and everyone dies lol
---
Another guy named "WBR" also does macro botting i reported him and i assume a ton of other people have to but i still see him play games and bot from time to time 
---
At this point i doubt reporting does anything 
---
You can speak for yourself. But you chose to do insults instead of bringing anything of substance and that is where you lose your argument. And what did I say that was a lie? It is opinion. Except for the fact people cried so much about the guardian kills in gambit that they changed the quest. That is a fact. 
---
#holy fuck
---
Its false because bosses are different, and legendary weapons can compete with exotic heavies in certain situations, like riven, and morgeth lol so you see you were factually incorrect, because you made A GENERALIZATION. So not once did I say ace of spades +legendary heavy+ chaos reach was better. (Not to mention a legendary energy shotgun was better then and still is better in some fights then any exotic heavy) What I said was-false, because not every fight an exotic heavy is better, so that blows your comment about that out of the water. Then I said that's why I use chaos reach which has dps, because it mathematically does,and not once did i say that it was better then an exotic heavy if you actually read dumbass, I specifically said that it does enough damage that I rarely need to use my heavy. The heavy could be the best damn thing in the game, all I said was I rarely need to use it. Words have meaning snowflake. 
---
All the people complaining don't remember that Y1 D1 Thorn quest.
---
Daily Powerful reward milestones reset after 4 days I think, outside of that you just have to wait til reset. The power gains are fairly fast in the beginning tho, if my memory serves me right. 
---
I have my frame but no ether is dropping
---
Report him to Bungie. And, if you're in PSN report him to Sony. Bungie may not do anything, but Sony is pretty harsh. Same with Microsoft if you're on live.
---
Holy fuck
---
My answer to your answer was:
---
"I really want to see how you fair in a raid or a high Handicap Nightfall with this mindset....
---
Well, nah, I don't want to look at that broken mess.....
---
Considering that you will very unlikely feel any difference in overall performance between Ace and any top tier Legendary HC in PvE, but an incredible big difference between Exotic Heavy and legendary ones in general PvE. 
---
The difference will get even bigger when doing actual difficult PvE activities like Raids, Dungeon and so on. You only have your super so often and spamming it isn't always the best choice, as well as using it on a boss..."
---
Sorry but trying to find a loop hole or outright lying ends this discussion for me. 
---
way too close to the power button :s
---
Weapon meta has changed enormously. Crucible is probably still repetitive, even if the particular weapons have changed. There's some fun new content and a ton of great potential randomly rolled black armory gear.
---
It's not a brand new game or anything, but imo it's a good time to get back into it.
---
I gotta admit though, you have a profoundly amazing ability to completely redirect the topic of the debate as soon as you start to look stupid. This all started with me stating I like my build, and you getting hot and bothered (for who knows the reasons, it's a video game after all) over my opinion not being the same as yours. Later on after I repeatedly expressed it was my opinion backed by several different damage tests that literally are public viewing on YouTube conducted by ACTUAL CONTENT CREATORS WITH THE CALCULATIONS ON SCREEN, you started down a completely seperate and random path about me telling you my setup was 100% superior, despite me saying that ace of spades was a better hand cannon stat wise, that chaos reach does shitloads of damage, and that I use my heavy to fuel my super. Then you mixed all that together to produce the absolute trash you are currently pushing 
---
I‚Äôve been rocking my FWC True Prophecy for 3,126 guardian kills now. Some claim to know the future better than we do.  
---
They don‚Äôt. 
---
Keep the faction alive!
---
[removed]
---
3 matches to get 27% 2 matches to get back to 7%
---
I dont completely suck but I dont live for  pvp either
---
People good at pvp can grind this out quick enough 
---
I have decided to wait until mayhem is over to try... mayhem is just too chaotic.
---
In Iron Banner I always have a positive kd ratio, but mayhem... not so much
---
The main problem with these type of quests is the imbalance...
---
If your good at pvp the quest seems easy and you get the new boom stick quickly, but those not really good at pvp this losing progress really hurts...
---
Want to make the quest easier? Put a limit on how far backwards you can go in a single match
---
I have never understood why people enjoy one sided matches... do you get an e-boner because your team of coordinated, working together in voice beat a bunch of individual randoms?
---
Why dont I just get my own team etc...? Because I dont enjoy crushing randoms any more than I enjoy getting crushed...
---
Got a strong team? Great... go play competition matches and leave us randoms alone... this will make the quest easier for everyone...
---
Whats the deal with simulation seeds? Noob question, but I heard theres a benefit from getting a shit ton of them. what for?
---
Did it drop masterworked? I didn‚Äôt realize there was a curated duke...
---
Is there something in the lore stating the stranger is  Elsie Bray. If so can you tell me where I can find it.
---
Gah spoiler alert!
---
Yes yes, let‚Äôs all get Blade Barrage! [Laughs in Tether pants]
---
Haha wait come back 
---
Absolutely with 6 shooter I could take out 6 or 7 majors/shielded wizards and knights in a lost sector them dump the rest of the shots into the boss and either kill it or get it down to about 15% health, with nighthawk you can one shot bosses you couldn't before like the bigass armored centurion that randomly spawns, and you do significantly more damage to strike bosses. Not to mention the energy regen from bottom tree precision hits are way higher, and the energy refunded upon a celestial nighthawk kill was also increased 
---
*cuts to stranger things intro*
---
Mayhem right now is one continuous nightmare song of Golden Gun sound effects
---
TBF dude it's not that hard it's two hours max per character on a Tuesday to get all the powerfall loot in a given week aside from maybe Petra and ikora's weekly challenges and I'm talking about solo so obviously raids are there own matter Im a retuning player from y1 and it does scare me a little how much I need to grind to even start on black Armoury content I really wanna do the forge for hammerhead but I'm only 591 and I'm gonna have to wait for next week to get much higher and I doubt I'll get all prime engrams for 600 loot this week unless I grind blind well and I know that when I get the last weapon I need from it I'm gonna say up yours to that damn activity 
---
Some people like me suck at PvP I guess :D
---
So Destiny is turning into Fortnite :/  I always wondered why I'm losing fights when I shoot first and die first. 
---
i mean d2 pvp has never been particularly skill based
---
no
---
Is it a Black Armory exclusive? I am assuming it is.
---
Yup basically, chuck em at walls and let them find people lol
---
Did the two of you just become best friends?
---
Just a tip, but Luna‚Äôs Howl quest progression only counts in the competitive playlist.
---
Watch some Cammycakes on youtube. He usually commentates as he plays, and gives you some insight inyo uow he thinks about PvP. I wasn't that great at PvP but watching a few of his videos honestly expanded how I approach situations and as a result, I've improved.
---
And I think learning to analyze those situations helps with learning from those experiences. Example of situation:
---
There is a guy around the corner, I don't have a shotgun, so pushing blindly would be stupid (especially if you have no backup). From the sounds I heard previously, and context of how he is moving, I am going to guess he doesn't either, and is gonna stay put because he hasnt pushed yet. I decide to push the corner with a scout rifle (dumb, but hear me out)
---
- Cut to a few seconds later after death - 
---
He had an smg and had a Titan melee ability ready for me, I didnt stand a chance. 
---
What could I have done better?
---
Maybe you wait for backup to help push the corner, maybe you back up, find a vantage point that gives your guns and abilities the advantagr, and wait for him to make a move. Maybe you switch to a better gun, or throw a grenade, etc. Etc.
---
Hope this helps a little!
---
I personally haven't seen this but there are plenty of other posts reporting the same thing. Definitely seems like a bug. 
---
dude fact is you either buy the pass for the gun or just deal with it instead of complaining on reddit.
---
Yes, but once the last section of the ascendant challenge has  been reached (someone enters the boss arena, in this case, the sword drops, things like that), anyone not inside cannot get back in until the fireteam members inside leave as well. 
---
Yep. Unfortunately.
---
Hold it holy it hold it. I love ds as much as any addict, but destiny 100% does not rip off that game. 
---
In terms of WoW I‚Äôm pretty sure you‚Äôre just a fool. To assume that having raids and similar activities in a game makes it a rip off of wow has just invalidated almost every mmo structure game on the market, I‚Äôm sorry but that‚Äôs not how tipping off works. 
---
Not only that but the two games you‚Äôve specified are entirely different genres. By the logic you‚Äôve displayed Destiny rips off legend of Zelda because it has combat and dungeon esque challenges in its raids, or that Destiny rips off Pok√©mon because it‚Äôs endgame stems around high level pve and poorly balanced pvp.
---
Ripping off is taking assets and activities designed entirely around one game and slightly tweaking them while maintaining the exact same gameplay style and loop. 
---
What you‚Äôve described here is what‚Äôs called a common shared aspect of many games that stems from the medium, it‚Äôs limitations, and the player‚Äôs desire to grind for the best loot utilizing high level cooperative or competitive activities.
---
U can‚Äôt use them in destiny w 
---
this guy is a troll just let him be 
---
I know some people advise against it, but use a cheesy super and play Mayhem!
---
Stay back a bit a play very defensive - run from fights you arent ready for.
---
Then, pop you super when you know you have a kill or 2. Use Spectral Blades, Sentinel Shield (middle tree), or Dawnblade (top tree I think). Roaming supers are dominant.
---
One of my favorite cut scenes of all time, Cayde-6 4evr
---
mm no.

The -5 on (at my time of ckecking)

"actually no lol again false üòÇ also why I specifically said I use chaos reach, which has enough dps that 99.9% of bosses I dont even need my heavy to kill"
---
And all the -1 after that say otherwise while all of mine are a 0 and +10 at best against +4 for your best. But I personally don't need votes/down-votes to prove my point as you failed to ever mention any reliable proof for any of your arguments. Based on numbers alone, all exotic heavy's are much better then legendary while Ace trades blows with Orchid
---
I started when Forsaken was released.  Bungie... I wanna get in on that Faction action.  I need a Sunshot catalyst dammit!
---
Black armory is great and you get so much more with the pass. 
---
It's called hyperbole. Not implying D1 or D2 are actual rip offs, just being funny and making a point. But will edit to clarify.
---
I hate when this happens. Buuuuut. Hilarious 
---
hilarious, considering Skittles is $1-2 depending where you get it.
---
this single gun would be $35 dollars ($85 dollars assuming i didn't already have the Forsaken DLC), that would be enough to preorder Anthem and get me a better experience that treats me like a player rather source of income with money left over.
---
 $35-85 is entirely unreasonable for a single, recycled gun that i've already used, and this is the same company that mutilated the Ace of Spades.
---
I don‚Äôt have forsaken and now I want to see that moment 
---
So that's where she went this week
---
The fall was exactly 20 stories.  
---
Pretty sure I listed every source. if you are too lazy to go on YouTube and simply type in and look up the damage tests idk what to tell you. Btw I never said legendary heavies were better then exotics, once again, you just connected some unrelated dots like usual. Funny how you call me immature yet continue to proceed with the conversation, pretty hypocritical (again) when you yourself being so much mature could just stop replying right? Funny how you keep rolling back to one single point in the conversation to base all your "data" off of, when that point is something you fabricated that I never actually said. you sir, are a complete joke
---
I don‚Äôt follow 
---
The right side, from my experience, doesn't have the teleporting rocks, only the ones that disappear after you're in them a certain time.
---
I dont think Uldren liked him.
---
 Also Ophidia Spathe or what ever that thing is called 
---
I‚Äôm just salty because I lost 30% on the Last Word quest in one round to a grouped 4 man 5 minutes ago.
---
Yep.
---
Yes!! Pc Master race All the way
---
PvE player that sucks in crucible* 
---
Why does everyone believe that as a pve player you have to suck ass in pvp? Haha
---
The fireteam that fights together, stays together.
---
I dont keep low quality pictures thanks
---
I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôve ever played crucible? The game type where people complain about these supers. You don‚Äôt seem to get that the ‚Äòsix shooter‚Äô tree is built with pvp in mind. I can‚Äôt see the future, but I know this community enough to guess how folks react to boosts like this. It will get nerfed. Besides if you‚Äôre choosing GG over BB or the tether bow for ad clear, then you need a re-evaluation.
---
I honestly wish they'd stop with the 'doing X removes progress' quests. I have no problems taking a long time to get something done, because at least progress is being made and that's encouraging. LOSING progress imo is just demoralizing and sucks the fun out of things. At least that's the feeling for me. Happened with the Malfeasance quest and made me legitimately not want to play Gambit because losing motes would take away progress. Same thing now for TLW. At least for the Chaperone the +/- was less severe. I got super hyped for the questline and a new weapon to get, only to immediately lose any and all hype at being stonewalled by the fact I'm not a stellar Crucible player.  
---
Even tried Mayhem, but that just wound up with getting killed over and over by Dawnblade supers or Ace of Spades after my Blade Barrage decided it should just miss nearly point blank multiple times. Boyfriend insists I must be doing something wrong,  though I wasn't aware there was any real secret to Blade Barrage outside of use super.
---
Congrats. I hate it.
---
Yup, after the next dlc. 
---
This is good until you get the people who want to spam tether in Mayhem. Then it's just getting ambushed by tether over and over and losing any progress you made.
---
Heart of Innermost Light. Using one ability enhances your *other* abilities.

I like to think hunters as the stealthy type, ik it's one specific class but on nightstalker we have incus and smoke bombs, (advice, in Pvp smokes will appear as another target on enemy radars, you can use them as bait, and we have some of the best exotics for boosting supers, raiden flux, celestial, Orpheus, gwynsin and shards while titans have OEM, ursa and skullfort, and warlocks have Phoenix protocol
---
Literally stopped doing forges once I got both random drop exotics.
---
Ah good, I just need to get the ship and ghost, and autorifle, I've been really unlucky with my drops as of late
---
I'm also speaking from a standpoint where I'm really only using it mid-close  range with a good overall secondary (well how I'd like to but haven't found that amazing pair yet) while I agree the quickdraw would be nice, I feel as if the ability and accuracy of the hip fire kinda makes up for not having quickdraw where as when Ads a normal recoil pattern would help alot more especially if they added range to it as bungie could (looking at sunshot's catalyst) the recoil when ADS isn't abysmal, but it could be alot better in my opinion, I mean you could shoot it ads roughly around 170-180 rpm with no issues (haven't done the testing just going off feeling, and it feels as if it's faster then my waking vigil when I'm waiting for the recoil to dampen if that makes any sense)
---
Oh. Cheers!
---
It works on grenade launchers so why not
---
"This is amazing"
---
also i posted it up for MOTW but i know it wont do anything lmao
---
Yes in general it is how you have written. 
---
At first you must unlock the forges (quest), then you get 2 weekly bounties from Ada, so you can only choose 2 Powerful Weapon Frames from 3 available. That is per character, so if you have all 3 characters you can get 6 per week. Available weapon frames are on rotation so not all weapons are available each week.
---
After you have chosen the 2 weapons, you can buy unlimited number of that weapon if you have the currency (you need 6 for 1 weapon). You get currency from completing forges (you get 2 from completing a forge and 1 from each daily bounty).
---
Weapon rolls are random so with luck you can get so called "god roll".
---
Different weapons require different forges but the last forge (Bergusia) can craft all weapons (even though it doesn't say that in the weapon descriptions!).
---
I also play pretty much only PVE and got it done in about 7 games running some combo of better devils, bygones, subtle calamity, and boreal is. Range is your friend rn, the meta is Luna‚Äôs (terrible range) the last word (also only really effective at close range) and jotunn (which has charge time and ammo issues). Watch choke points with a sniper/ pulse/ bow and you should be able to knock it out pretty fast. I‚Äôve spent about six hours and all I have left to do is the three witch rituals, so it‚Äôs not a bad quest. Haven‚Äôt played in a couple months and only really played PVE and gambit for the breakneck. Keep at it, guardian!
---
It doesn't. A good shotgun player wins the duel everytime. Ik I'm being downvoting, but on my clan we are constantly destroying TLW players on competitive with blues and several other shotguns. 
---
You can ADS, you just gotta give it a second and use it more like a 150-180 instead of the 225 rpm, figured out when it's dropping from the initial recoil that's when you want to shoot it (for me personally) it's a much more trial and error to find the sweet spot while Ads, personally I feel as bungie could have made it purposely like that to make that be a catalyst or prevent it from being spammed as the optimal TTK is 0.53 seconds while Luna's I believe is either 0.64 or 0.67 I can't remember either way though... It just really takes time to figure it out 
---
having played both im gonna say that there's a lot less toxicity in the warframe community
---
Also not everyone is going to actually use it 
---
Some people like to collect stuff.
---
But calling people that are not good at PVP crybabies? Not everyone is good at PvP, that doesn't mean that this gun is only for people who are good at PvP
---
People who are bad at Gambit doesn't deserve Melefeance?
---
The Drifter gives this quest. Not Shaxx.
---
If it were Shaxx than it would make sense. 
---
The Drifter gives Gambit quests, so this quest doesn't mean a lot of sense.
---
It's your opinion and I respect it.
---
Super hard grind in crucible! (3 matches done) 
---
That's the point. TLW range is more specific than Ace one,  knowing that a regular Ace player would win a duel "everytime".
---
Wavesplitter and rocket launcher üòä
---
Same, I kept all my common armor and my Traveler‚Äôs chosen.
---
You will see.
---
I have the whole set of 3 in my vault, but my titan still holds onto his as a reminder. 
---
Long story short to the reply above I put, 
---
You just gotta trial and error experiment (I'd say blind well or EP due to lots of constant spawning enemies) then just figure out how much of a delay you need to feel comfortable with the recoil, like I said above I feel comfortable when TLW is dropping back to where you started aiming at so I shoot again when it starts to drop back to the original place making it slower but more accurate (I want to say the rpms would be around 150-180 if you do it that way, slower by alot but still respectable within range )
---
Good advice I have kept a subtle calamity with EP rounds :D
---
I need the ship.
---
No problem, hope you get it done mate. 
---
Just make sure whoever goes in to that room doesn't leave it at all or it kills you, almost forgot to mention that lol
---
Appreciate it 
---
Bergusia would come with the purple shader on the curated roll.
---
This is a curated roll from the "normal" forge for the handcannon.
---
All I can think of is the 15th wish
---
Can't do over the shoulder, I learned recoil control and was spoiled at how smooth the gunplay is in D2.
---
Also Gambit is fun as hell. I can actually play with pubs and not throw my keyboard across the room.
---
so an unbelievable bad noob at pvp, what's the better cheese? Dawnblade or Blade Barrage?
---
Tell me more about my friend.
---
Sorry for hijacking that post, but if I have a shader on any piece of equipment is there a way to replicate it? Say, I have it on an AR but want it on all of my armor. Can I do that somehow?
---
Cause timegating to stretch that play time thats why
---
F*cking Titans, let him do it./s
---
That explains a lot
---
Its about the wall of wishes in the last wish raid, its the last wish left undiscovered
---
Yeah, I did it too yesterday, it's pretty lame.
---
You basically have to use the sword, and being a hunter, every guide had Stompees, WHICH I DO NOT.
---
Essentially I got the first one done without cheese due to a nice little video, and then the same guy goes to the second using the sword, so that was lame.
---
Got it explained in another video later, but boy was it annoying to get right.
---
If you wish I can post said videos. 
---
The quest you have to do say 500LL
---
If you have the desired shader on a weapon, dismantle that weapon and you will get the shader unlocked. Then you will be able to go to your collections and get as much of that shader as your heart desires. 
---
Oh yeah. I have used it for the 2 chest whises. What are the other 13 whises for? 
---
....why do I read the sexy tips like Todd Howard seducing me in the bathroom of a Fleetwood Mac concert?
---
So no heroic mode for Forges? shame :(
---
Thorn was great just shoot someone twice and then let the poison deal with the rest and then stalk your next prey 
---
she showed her true self
---
The quest was highly anticipated, but not many people took into account that the quest would have a slight degree of difficulty. I liked the quest quite a bit, mostly because it was doable solo from start to finish.
---
fair enough, it's the fastest ttk primary in the game clocking in at 0.53 secs
---
Finally got my queen breaker and love it. 
---
Lmao what a hateful creative hooman. 
---
There are sooo many casuals in this game... who just lock in to do patrols and feel good killing random stuff... because it's easy and sometimes there's yellow loot. But who die in the easiest of activities and don't move 2 inches in PVP fights. Imagine back in the days, everyone logged in to a Halo Game, doing the campaign on EASY... again and again and again.
---
i was having a stroke trying to read this
---
Basically me trying to do the step that requires kills in mayhem
---
Bro idk what to tell you, this quest is probably the easiest crucible related exotic quest in destiny history, and bungie even threw people who suck at pvp a lifeline by releasing the quest while mayhem Is going on. Literally a game mode where even the shittiest player can spam supers and get kills on easy mode. if you cant complete the steps even with mayhem active...big yikes
---
but both are from gambit
---
Meanwhile I‚Äôve been playing destiny since the beta all those years ago...... never touched a raid 
---
You can literally get the ‚Äúpremium‚Äù currency by trading certain in game items, so I mean.
---
They said less toxicity in warframe not more xD
---
As a PVE player I can tell you that PVP is a welcome break from the grind, I just don't like how snowbally PVP can get and thus I don't get as much enjoyment out of it. Most people aren't mad they have to do PVP just mad that they can't compete with the players who have more skill than them and thus they are stuck on a quest step.
---
Agree the can shove it
---
Yep, and all of the gear, and sorrow mg2
---
One man in my fireteam got 1K Voices and a glittering key on his first last wish run. While im her and have done over 40 las wish and still no 1K Voices. Feelsbadman
---
TLW is pretty balanced IMO. It has not a lot of range but melts in cqc
---
I went to high school with the kid in the memeüòÇ they took that pic in one of our classes and it went viral less than a month later
---
Not gonna lie half the problem is you check the percentage all the time
---
It‚Äôs much less frustrating if you just play the game and then check your percentage during the queue for the next one (or perhaps every couple games)
---
I had a void fusion rifle with maxed stability. Thankfully I had the quest on my Warlock too, so nova bomb was the way forward. Atheon‚Äôs Epilogue was surprisingly effective in Crucible seeing as how much of a bullet hose it was. 
---
Dude, I snipe with Go Figure at Bank approx and collect after clearing the area. By the time I finish, majority of my team has gone out of their way and taken those motes. 
---
According to Charlemagne bot, I average 19 motes a game, and I also top leaderboards usually in enemies killed (that wasn't from the bot, I just usually average 100-130 enemies killed a game). BUT less than 20% of all the motes I collected also get lost (so about 4 per game, but I've had bad games where I was young and dumb and grabbed 15 and got killed and bump that average up. Lessons learned the hard way, I guess). And because I bank so much, I tend to be the invader killer, too.
---
Point is, the people collecting 15 aren't doing the most. They try to save for that big blocker, hide when invaded, and then get mad when they get killed by an invader. Clear an area, and when they spawn in the next area, bank. The enemy knows when you're saving for big blockers, there is a scoreboard that shows how many motes are banked compared to on-hand at the top of the screen. Without fail, when it gets too big, the screen is gonna flash red.
---
I use 
---
spectral blades (I was maining the subclass before it got any buffs so everybody calm down)
---
TLW + fate cries foul
---
6th coyote with 5 paragon mods and dynamo on my boots
---
And also nothing like Destiny and not really comparable. Only the words "loot" and "space"
---
Beautifully put, PvP is so fucking sweaty right now
---
There's no step that "requires" Mayhem. Only people suggesting to go into Mayhem for that particular step. Personally, I got it done in regular Quickplay in about 4 games.
---
It's almost as if... it's a different game than halo. And what's wrong with being casual? Not everyone is here to sweat their balls off 24/7
---
Toxicity thrives off of a community that asks for challenges, then immediately bitches about how hard the challenges are. Its not me saying that I found it easy, it's a fact that this step is less complicated and simpler to achieve then other ones we have had. I mean people thought getting a couple hand cannon kills in gambit was too hard. Like are you kidding me? the biggest thing that makes me angry is that when chaperone was a crucible quests, nobody cared. The only reason last words quest is an issue is because shitty players think having last word will make them not shitty, so they want the gun and if its challenging to get, o no better call for change. Funny how I never saw that with chaperone
---
Hehehehe I love it.
---
Do have to say that it's full curse week so the spawn chance is drastically increased, but still Noice. 
---
you got a discord? I suck at photoshop but I could give you a hand with the sexy maemaes
---
Haha I know man, but it feels bad as 1k is not toooo great. 
---
It was too easy especially the last fight, I did it blind didn't die once which kinda sux
---
too bad they release this patch after cayde's death
---
We MW2 now
---
That happened to me the other day, we were doing a public event and everyone who took part of it found a Cerbereus+1 haha! 
---
Just flash it off when ur grinding for the grenade launcher raid wepon
---
I like to rumble with it to farm for angry psn comments 
---
I thought that Frost-EE5 only recharged your melee, grenade and class ability? Pretty sure it do not increase the super recharge 
---
Competitive crucible is a trashcan indeed, can't argue with that.
---
I am on the last reset right now. Going to get it by the end of the week
---
ADS on console definitely has ridiculous recoil, PC does too but not nearly as bad. The recoil is also different from pretty much any other hand cannon, it goes up then comes back down most of the way, then the rest of the way is like in slow motion, which means if you try to time your shots, that slow motion bit just ruins your time to kill. On PC what seems to be working for me, weirdly enough, is jiggling my aim up and down a bit lol. Console, I‚Äôve got nothing, that recoil looks insane.
---
Damn, I lost my count again!
---
I am gonna do it but I am not gonna like it, and that is the problem here it is hard to challenge people but keep it in a fair margin for people who wanna do it casually, the community has many different people in it who don't see eye to eye, you and I for example.
---
 Bungie has to walk a fine line on what content to provide for who and when, you gotta remember that that means if the newest content drop is really only for people who are skilled/willing/stubborn enough to under go it then the people who just wanna have fun aren't gonna like it.
---
 I understand how it feels on both ends but a lot of people don't and clearly I have not made any headway here in trying to give people of your mindset or similar in the Destiny community some perspective. But just like the quest I will keep trying and when it happens I will be proud of myself for seeing it through.
---
This is so cute ... I saw people in other mmos (not yet in destiny) that Had 15k hours 
---
I‚Äôm not a virgin and I would wear that...sooooo?
---
Stay with teammates and team shot, assists equal 2 points too
---
Got the exact same role from crucible milestone yesterday!
---
Lock any upgrades. Takes 2 seconds.
---
I actually stopped playing the classes with Shouldercharge. I main a Titan and I play way to reckless when I can Shouldercharge. 
---
Night time is when I get sick of the daylight and Thundercrash the sun
---
of course not lol 
---
I guess only you can comment snipe people right?
---
I can help you tomorrow, or a friend could help you today, my GT is NomBoy544 and my friend‚Äôs is Broken Crxwn.
---
Pssh, I invade with a sword, as only the most cultured of gentleman would do.
---
So are you trying to be helpful, or have you just decided that you‚Äôre going to be an asshole today?
---
I think it also affects sliding and jumping. That's why you get so fast with Titan skating as it (ab)uses the jumping boost.
---
Shift on the PC
---
says the one who sniped my comment, which was of me being helpful to someone who asked me a direct question, then downvoted my response lol who is the real asshole? you are 
---
For those who are struggling with this quest, which part of the PVP steps are you struggling on? 
---
I was about to say good luck finding his portal then bam! Game match.. Donkey Konggggg
---
Man up and solo the whole thing
---
Double check it make sure that step isnt already complete i havent heard of any bug with the fallen ether 
---
What the hell is ‚Äúcomment sniping‚Äù? Is there some new Reddit metagame I‚Äôm not aware of?
---
I feel like the golden gun or blade barrage is much better for shutting down supers. And you also got the invisibility on spectrale blades that is very easy to activate (2 luna shots then crouch and then kill) overall the tether is not a PvP super even if you can vanish supers most of them got a fast movement option and the tether do not activate right away, so yeah I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs very good. 
---
Agree to disagree. I regularly get 30+ kill games in quickplay with top tree nightstalker and I attribute the success to my ability build working well with my armor and weapons.
---
Yeah, but with weapons at 650 I will be at 250. Or I have to constantly craft lower weapons? Lol 
---
Yea thats what im saying about the collections. Just keep crafting weapons at lower LL(commons mostly to save resources) until youre LL10
---
The randomness is pretty random, that's all I know
---
This means you are good not the super lol. Even if you get 30+ kills sometimes, what makes you think that you wouldn‚Äôt get higher score with golden or spectral blade or even the new arc staff that is very good.
---
Part 2 was a little frustrating at times (specifically when it would bug and subtract 2 points per death), but it didn‚Äôt take too long for me as an average player. The medals part really just happened organically.
---
I play the subclass for the neutral game, not the super. I just have the ether in case I see a group of enemies or a Nova Warp or spectral blades, if I don‚Äôt have a situation to use it in, I forget I even have it.
---
Machines are predictable. Humans aren't.
---
Nah man, I just went for it. and I got it! Stuck a shader and a backup mag on it instantly.
---
Both [Toil and Trouble](https://www.light.gg/db/items/2957367743/toil-and-trouble/) and [Baligant XU7743](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3461377698/baligant-xu7743/) can get everything but Opening Shot, but it can roll Snapshot Sights (part of the curated Wishbringer) and Moving Target. They can also roll with Full Auto as the first perk (instead of Slideshot).
---
While I understand the appeal of Slideshot, I love Full Auto... it's hard to go back after having that.
---
Spoilers she's sick of you playing destiny and has laced the mug with cyanide. Don't use it. Make her a drink of tea in it and have her use it first to confirm my suspicions. If she doesn't drink it you know i'm right.
---
(damn my suspicious mind, this is why my ex left).... I mean..... That's a very nice mug!
---
I feel you. but my point is, no one is making you get this gun. its your choice. its a gun catered/focused to pvp. so just like getting lunas howl in competitive. If you hate competitive and pvp, you are not going to have fun on this quest and should not go for lunas. this gun sucks in pve like really sucks in pve. if you dont like pvp then you shouldnt go for it.
---
or if we flip the table, one thousand voices. thats a great pve gun, kind of sucks in pvp imo. to get it you have to raid, a hard pve activity. As a mostly pvp player i was having a tough time raiding every week to get it. But i didnt complain because i knew it was a pinnacle pve weapon and i was going to have to do really difficult pve content to get it so i just took the pain because i wanted the prize. but if i really hated raiding i would just not go for the gun. you dont have to go for the last word if you hate pvp.
---
Now back to me and pvp.  I usually play crucible solo or duo almost never in a stack because my clan is mostly pve or I‚Äôm lazy to find a stack. I would just say I‚Äôm generally just good if im not tired, in a good mental state and not getting tilted. Ill get 30-40 kills a match at my highest, or 10-15 if im having a bad day. no one is perfect.  I usually play around with my builds for fun and keep it fresh. ill only usually crutch to my meta god roll stuff if im getting steamrolled by a meta 6 stack like you described. 
---
Now to the feeling of losing. I know very well the feeling of losing.  When I started destiny 2 up until a few months ago I was terrible at pvp. I would have a bad KD every game and usually lose. I felt like I was losing 90% of 1v1s vs enemies during matches. Yes it was not fun and it hurts and gets me tilted. But that inspired me to analyze my mistakes, use my noggin, control my emotions, and excel as a player.
---
The feeling of losing. That brings me to my next comparison.  The kill steps for the last word is a lot like the quest step for Luna‚Äôs Howl where you have to get Fabled rank in competitive, just much easier. I got Luna‚Äôs Howl 90% SOLO. It was two months of pain and suffering to get fabled and get the gun. Its painful to see your rank 10 points lower than 4 hours ago when you played just because you kept facing 4 stacks and lost more matches than you won. Knowing that you only have until the end of the season to get there or you have to start over, the days go by and you are losing points sometimes nonstop. Its bad. BUT I did it because I really wanted Luna‚Äôs even though I questioned if all this stress was worth it. But I never complained ‚Äúwhy did bungie make it so hard to get, competitive crucible is so hard‚Äù Because I know its one of the best guns in the game and a pinnacle reward for pvp. It‚Äôs SUPPOSED to involve difficult pvp content, just like a pve pinnacle content. I didn‚Äôt go for loaded question because I felt like I wouldn‚Äôt enjoy doing 40 strikes and specifically using arc and fusion rifles. The last word quest is comparable to the format of the quest to get fabled rank in competitive. Losing pushes you back winning pushes you forward.  Again,  last word is a pvp centric weapon, it SHOULD have challenging pvp quest steps like this. I am glad bungie has pinnacle weapons and exotics that are really focused towards the activities they come from and involve quest steps in those activities, not just making everything bland and easy to get.  The Last word isn‚Äôt even that great like there are still other guns I would use over it in a split second if the match mattered and I really wanted to try hard.  If someone is really suffering from pvp I wouldn‚Äôt even go for last word.
---
 If we are talking about winning/losing instead of kills for the last word, then no offense I think thats a terrible idea. Let me explain. Most of the time in the crucible, even in clash, its very hard to shine as an individual. It‚Äôs still a very team meta game.  Me being a mostly solo player, I would say that most of the time my scores and K/D are great. But funny enough I LOSE MOST GAMES. Why? Because most of the time and especially in Control (which seems to come up all the time now in QP) you can have 40 kills in the match and if your team is bad or the enemy is a sweaty 6 stack who controls points, you will lose. It‚Äôs hard to carry a team in this game if your team mates are getting 2-3x less kills than you.  I face so many 4-6 stacks as a solo player in quick play  and I am sure most others do as well. I as an individual usually do very well in every match but I LOSE MOST matches anyway because of just bad match making luck. I think that is the case with many other people and win/loss quest would take forever because most people lose solo games.
---
If you are on PS4 and ever want someone to run pvp with or ask me any advice, feel free
---
Hahaha nice
---
I don't mind harder, but so much of PvP is out of your control. You can do your best then get someone round by some pros and lose most of your progress. Tedious doesn't make for good game play.
---
Are you realising that everything you said can also be used against Destiny 2? Did you already forgot who financed and launched it ? 
---
  
---
You are right about EA and it's behaviour. But saying this while praising Destiny sounds really ironic.  
---
Saying that just because something is free means it's good is also very lazy......
---
ok even if you're bad at pvp it will take you a few days or a week to get Last word. its really not that bad for a cool exotic. took me 2 months of solo competitive to get Luna's howl. it was painful but i really wanted the gun and i got it. I am not bragging but i am making a comparison because that quest to get fabled you lose progress everytime you lose. Its supposed to be like that, its a pvp pinnacle weapon. But its supposed to be difficult and you dont have to do it if you find the activity not fun.
---
I know. I really want that Opening Shot in combination with it. It may never happen though! :( 
---
I'll have to try out one of mine with full auto and rapid fire frame. I wonder if it'll be even better than my Mindbender. 
---
also, at least on ps4, in this last word quest i didnt faace any sweaty stacks like that. and usually dont. maybe more of a pc thing? i face 6 stack NF OEM steams like maybe 1 out of 10 matches usually
---
Frankly I agree. I thought the crucible steps were fun and if not easy, very doable. 
---
Damm that's a really nice legendary ghost shell, too bad about your other recent discoveries /s
---
I have an idea... a *Star-Crossed* pairing, you might say...
---
Nah thats 100% possible I have done it and am by no means as good as baken. If a guy is standing still around a lane that is popular he is a pretty easy target.
---
We all know it was pilfered from the Exodus Black.
---
Oh how the turntables
---
What about targeting adjuster? That's what I run...
---
I have 1 more frame this week, really hope I get Le Monarque just so I can stop grinding frames
---
Mayhem is great for that part.
---
Maybe thinking of Whisper Heroic?  
---
I am really struggling with the part that sets you back if you die because i will get up to about 10% but then im back at 0 within a minute of the next match.
---
Ahh, gotcha. :( Good luck on your hunt!
---
Yeah - I was playing around with it on an aggressive frame. I didn't know full auto could roll on a rapid-fire frame... that's insane!
---
You must be low light. It's not hard at all, just time consuming.
---
This is where *you* are told to ‚Äúgit gud‚Äù I bid you **adieu**.
---
Yep agreed i'm a bad pvp player took me ages to get to 38% and in 3 game lost most of it , made me rethink how i play. Hopefully we will get it done.
---
I'd like to see some old raid gear from kings fall and crotas end.
---
I fucking love it
---
It can, like Toil for instance, but it isn't particularly helpful. 
---
Yeah, I died 16 times, got on reddit and saw [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny_2/comments/alll4i/how_to_easily_kill_enkaar/). Made me even more pissed that I wasted so much time.
---
yeah apparently i do play to much destiny 
---
Geez, I didn't know 7 year olds browsed Reddit.
---
Imagine punching a black hole lol
---
Mk. 44 Stand asides also give overshield while sprinting (and half tackle cooldown for even more cheesy free oneshot kills)
---
I faced a team of 6  (same clan) that had TLW already. Pain in the @$$
---
does the infinite forest welcome me?
---
I'm surprised Nova Warp is still decent. Good to see. 
---
This is the first post today that actually made me laugh.
---
It does, admittedly, but it's nice in PvE.
---
Mayhem, you don't need a gun if you throw enough grenades, and if you don't...well let's just say that papa Shaxx will be disappointed
---
Does he have a Sandra Bullock blindfold on too?
---
Maybe on the weekend so more "crucinoobs" are there cause of days off of work and such
---
Apparently it helps GREATLY in getting Lunas, too. 
---
Yeah I know it's possible, but like you said is it sucks haha
---
Apparently there is a known bug with some of this stuff.  You may want to check out bungie's site to see what they have said.
---
Good argument, the kiddies will be free to play as well. Also when I see 3 or 4 stacks with Luna‚Äôs all I can say is let bygones be bygones hehe.
---
I  must have been really lucky. I got the rare bounty where I had to kill enemies while wearing a full set of forge weapons and armor. üòÇ
---
There is an LED kinda light on it - effect procs when all 3 are lit I think. 
---
It's hard if you're not good at PvP, or don't play Crucible much (mostly the same thing, but the latter is just a lack of experience, the former can also be a skill or reaction-time issue). You have to have decent learned behaviors to avoid getting crushed (since all the PvPers are grinding for TLW or using TLW). 
---
As someone who hates Crucible and never plays it, I realized that I had a habit of running into combat as soon as possible, and de-prioritized running next to teammates. Once I got in the habit of going around with others, and being more careful (since I usually have played objective-based PvP, I generally didn't focus on my deaths) I didn't exactly become a PvP god (I can't even decide what I want as my loadout, and as Warlock my class isn't exactly built for PvP), but I had consistent enough success that getting through the Crucible portions of the quest didn't take long. Also, having decent PvP weapons helps; I rarely use Trust in PvE, but it and AoS as backup brought me good results in Crucible.
---
tl;dr - If you don't play Crucible and have bad or inexperienced PvP habits, yes, it can be pretty difficult. Choosing the right weapons helps a lot, too.
---
If the true power of TLW is having a teammate assist in shooting behind you... that's indeed pretty strong : P
---
I think you hit him twice. Your ally behind you must have helped quite a bit.
---
Do some practice with the timing and figure out how long of a count it takes in your head for it to proc, makes it easier when you just count "1,2,shoot" to hit it every time. Also I think it makes a sound when it's charged and you need to release it, and the sights definitely light up brighter when it fully charges letting you know when to release it. Once you get the hang of it you can proc almost every shot and it's a lot of fun!
---
Well, if you finish level 1 and 2 but you don't kill the boss it counts for your banner (100 gofannons)
---
Aaans for the 100 forged weapons, it can be in any forge.. And idk how I got to 100 but.. I farmed hard the guns I wanted every reset
---
The best tip I can give you is to have patience :D
---
I'm doing this since the ship is available in the collections (week 2 of the black armory iirc)
---
Not even
---
Or show them the way out with a good bygone
---
Ward of Dawn shines in PvE content. Love it for gambit, strikes, EP etc. . In PvP on the other hand, there are better options for a warlock. 
---
That's what I was thinking. Good to hear. 
---
Oh yeah that‚Äôs what I meant just memeified
---
well for that reason i didn't know how to use it properly hahahaha(for the record i was searching for jotunn but...)
---
Excuse me for having a wife, a stepson, a job, school, friends, etc...
---
I got coup as my first ever drop from levi. Feelgoodman
---
It‚Äôs just people whining
---
It's so fun to use in pve
---
ohhhhhh damn that was a great explanation, thank u dude\^\^
---
I did cuz I was so horrible at pvp. LOL  I couldn't get it done until I got atheons epilogue.
---
I meant the right side towards the final chest, which certainly never changes at least in my experience, having failed four times before actually completing it and all, mate.
---
It is still there. 
---
Same. I joined a team that was willing to help me get my first ever completion, we jumped into a Calus cp and boom! I got it fully masterworked too. 
---
ok i'll try it! for sure it have to be very fun but my dead ass titan brain didn't get the idea of how to use it hahahahahh
---
any tips for the last bit?   
---
I know they shoot in spawn order
---
anything else you would recommend?
---
The 0.5 kd thing?
---
Thats a lie
---
"I don't need a plan. I'll simply head-butt it."
---
I'm running a combination of medium/high settings with motion blur on and FPS capped to 145 on pc
---
Solo players want a word with you...
---
Nice
---
Noice! Congroots mah dawd :3
---
does it matter which powerful frames? for example to get the jotunn to drop does it have to be both a) a fusion rifle powerful frame and b) done at the bergusia forge?
---
Literally killed by an architect!
---
Mida and mini in the same strike?  Nice. 
---
Same, I tried turning on motion blur and it made everything feel much smoother somehow
---
Hold onto that. This shotty is superb. Slideways is a very underrated perk. 
---
That's not what that means at all. Free is used in that pretty common saying because it means it has almost zero barrier to entry outside if installing it. 
---
Stick with the old one. Drop mag is great in crucible but in pve it eats ammo fast, especially when you keep reloading to proc kill clip. 
---
We all wanted to do this in 1AU.
---
exactly this, I'd just unlocked it recently and was having fun messing around with it. definitely not the best pve weapon 
---
Use one of the exotic scouts or maybe strum if you have the masterwork, the duke mk44 is good as well if you have outlaw, blast furnace is solid at nearly any range, and I've been killed by vigilance wing a couple games
---
Just realized golden gun counts towards hand cannon kills do mayhem. 
---
After quite a few crucible matches using it I think 8 rounds is a little low but it helps keep it balanced. For a catalyst I think maybe outlaw or a rapid hit-style perk would be neat, offsetting the small mag with a lightning-fast reload
---
Yeah, a mix of medium/high settings with motion blur
---
Heh nice
---
Right now I see more people complaining about those that dont like the PVP part than people complaing about the PVP part
---
Initiating spin!
---
The true endgame. 
---
Np
---
Shaxx tough him well
---
To be fair this was all before we knew about shit like the ascendant realm so pretty much there was nothing she could have done, especially since he'd already gained strength from killing other guardians.
---
I heartily agree with this - I suck at PVP and hit mayhem with spectral blades - wrapped it up in a couple hours.  Used blast furnace, shotgun, and thunderlord.  Killed quite a few outside of my super.  Was also killed a crap ton by blade barrage.  That one map that's white with the middle room with the heavy is no bueno with this setup though.  I ended up hiding in the corner to not drop my k/d on that one.
---
That's exactly what a Titan would say. 
---
Primary ammo finder perks 
---
This would explain why no one ever joins me in my luna well.  themoreyouknow.jpg.
---
Nothin personell kid
---
God i miss it so much reading that. Favourite thing ever to do in d1
---
Right now there isn't, but in the future presumably there will be. 
---
I was getting pasted by Luna‚Äôs howl, Mida, and of course other last word owners. Seems to be lots of load outs that will work, but for me it was hanging back with Graviton Lance. Finished the crucible parts last night! Looking forward to The Draw later today.
---
Is it Tower section? Only DO shaders are Camo amd Ressurection there.
---
Gorgeous
---
S.T.A.Y
---
Just click on the farm and go from there :)
---
Good point. Forges are particularly bad in that pressing esc does nothing 90% of the time.
---
My friend is not a professional, but she is very talented and I greatly appreciate the work put in.  This is her first piece based around a game or a weapon, I think it turned out rather well
---
You only get penalized if you leave multiple in quick succession I think but they said they changed it up in the update on Tuesday so I‚Äôm not sure
---
Finish the main story line to unlock the rest of the game. 
---
For some honest advice tho: Play defensively, PICK YOUR BATTLES, and run away when you're in danger. You may need to change up your play style if youre a person who dies a lot. Play with teammates and use them as meat shields if you must. Godspeed Guardians 
---
As the title says I‚Äôm new to this game all tho I played the first somewhat. 
---
I played for an hour or two today from launch, had lunch then came back and I‚Äôm kinda stuck here. What is my main objectives? Where do I start? 
---
I got the legendary pack half price so I have the full game with Forsaken, Expansion 1 &amp; Expansion 2. Want to do the story mission first. (Xbox. Thanks guys. 
---
Gambit 
---
Go to the farm and you‚Äôll get your first ship that will unlock planets 
---
I bet they forgot how to spell volundr, so they well like, "well, fork, I guess i cant spell, well I guess im putting little to no effort into this, sooooo EDZ FORGE 610+!!!"
---
You may have The Last Word, but he had the last laugh.
---
Is the mission hard? I‚Äôm a solo player and it took a long time to complete the malfeasance mission
---
Here are a few things I wish I had know at the start:
---
Keep your highest light weapons from each level as you go up.  Put them in the vault once you no longer need them. They will help you lvl up your alt characters quicker.
---
Go ahead and create your alts.  Level them together.  You will find that your light will get higher quicker this way.
---
While progressing through the story go ahead and do those orange &amp; blue missions.  They will help you lvl up quicker.
---
Go see Hawthorne as soon as you can after you hit a new lvl.  She always has 1 weapon and 3 armor pieces for glimmer.  This can also help you up your light quicker.  
---
If you can find an XP ghost use it, or as soon as you can buy from Tess get fireteam medallions.
---
Join a Clan.  They will help you through the game and you can get addional power engram drops from the clan once you reach a certain lvl.
---
Google the public events.  Learn how each one is made heroic.  Heroic public events give more XP and a chance at better loot.  Slim chance, but still a better chance.
---
How can you farm dust rock?
---
&gt; because it's pretty widely acknowledged that the warframe community is one of the most helpful and friendly gaming communities around.
---
You forgot the /s there...
---
Warframe's community IS friendly...as long as you drink the cool-aide and nod your head vigorously every time someone praises Warframe or DE.  However...voice a negative opinion about any aspect of the game and it's fucking children of the corn over there...
---
You have 3 character slots, you can play through it 3 times (or more if you delete characters)
---
Yup literally just a flat buff! Still trying to see which exotic would be best!
---
Or if it does, it's just going to keep getting delayed by people doing escalation protocol.
---
Indeed
---
And speed and more damage lol
---
I'm a PvE main
---
It‚Äôs amazing I just ran it in a forge with Eternal Warrior and literally ran my super for a whole round while the other 2 dunked batteries. I LOVE IT!!
---
I thought you were talking about titan and how it‚Äôs literally always a heroic event
---
You like punching things! You equip Winter's Guile, Go Bottom Lock tree for devour. Get armor perks that increase regen speed of Melee/Grenades/Class. 
---
Consume your grenade, or punch something. Each kill grants full health, and increases melee damage done. More melee kills = fast grenades. Toss Grenades eat grenades throw wells etc. You are now an unstoppable punching machine.
---
This works in Forges eat a grenade pick up an orb and proceed to bash everything to death like a deranged psychopath. 5 stacks 2 hits Majors, single hits nearly everything.
---
I like to hop a little then punch to do a Falcon Punch esque move that covers enormous amounts of ground.
---
Each week the dialogue from turning in offerings to the oracle is the same for all players, regardless of how many times you have done that before. It's not something you can redo by playing on other characters. 
---
&gt;How can you farm dust rock?
---
There are lost sectors that have weapons tied to them and they very reliably drop like every second or third run.  
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/9oiuxt/wanted\_lost\_sector\_bosses\_have\_specific\_loot\_drops/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/9oiuxt/wanted_lost_sector_bosses_have_specific_loot_drops/)  
---
Dust Rock Blues can be found in following ones:  
---
   
---
Pathfinder's Crash (EDZ)  
---
Whispered Falls (EDZ)  
---
Cavern of Souls (EDZ)  
---
Core Terminus (Mars)   
---
I personally used EDZ's Pathfinder's Crash lost sector ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCCWgR2y0H4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCCWgR2y0H4) )  
---
If you have a whisper of the worm you can literally kill first kill few ads, then kill the boss from the distance, run back and in again, do it few times and then pick up whatever thats on the ground (engrams will not disappear if you run out of lost sector without picking them up, so i think its better to pick them up in bulk)
---
Me too. Reload speed masterwork too. It‚Äôs a beast. Feels very snappy.
---
But it's a grenade launcher, who uses those?
---
I use Luna + well 100% in Volundr, because the best heavy there is a good MG. You get flinched way to much to try whisper, but in a well you‚Äôre freaking invincible as you get bashed around and your MG bullet-hose just wont stop!
---
But yea, a well in Bergusia is great, just not with lunas.
---
Make it a subsection on the tangled shore, like nessus orbit on nessus map.
---
So... My Parcel of Stardust has Full Choke and Accurized Rounds.  But it's range is handling.  So I assume that it is pretty decent?  Or Maybe half Decent.
---
too bad the curated roll is trash
---
I'm glad it could be of service :)
---
Let's be real, we all know Titans would rather slide into it with a shotgun.
---
1 second to press, one second to confirm thats what I wanted to do.
---
Do it on Titan then
---
Certainly not me. I wish the game would give me this sort of luck with weapons I would actually use ü§£
---
I bet his favorite gun is a flaming hammer
---
Wow... TIL.  I had no idea.  Thanks for that info.
---
Thought he was talking about the main storyline. Yea those oracle events are unique each week
---
If you have shards step 2 is a breeze in mayhem. It almost feels like cheating. I got it in 3 matches
---
Nah Xbox 
---
Thorns gonna be a pain
---
A lot of early game things are surprisingly hard to google because the game has changed so much. For example, planet tokens no longer exist, masterwork cores are now called enhancement cores, patrols unlock automatically instead of from a quest, bounties used to be called challenges, and challenges used to be called milestones. 
---
After a few unsuccessful googles, people probably just assume nothing is google-able about this game. 
---
But also some people suck at using google, or just *looking at what the game is telling them*. 
---
What platform you on? PS4? I‚Äôll run it with you if you wanna try running w someone 
---
Nova warp has been nerfed right down into a deep grave. It really was a hammering, Nova bomb and the other subclasses are far better now.
---
I mean its still "viable" but it's far from top tier.
---
BB hunters are still rampant and out of control from what I saw. Seems this season is season of the hunter!
---
Been running this forge since it dropped and can‚Äôt get this gun, I hate you 
---
HOW THE FUCK
---
No I'm pc, my husband plays himself but on ps4 so he cant help me unfortunately 
---
Thats where it gets you
---
Why aren‚Äôt you? 
---
The nickname tho
---
Oh look, post taking the piss out of a PvE sided player scared of PvP, and here‚Äôs a comment from a PvP player struggling immensely in PvEüòÖ gotta love one sided players
---
Yup, I'm hoping we get some new stuff cause I really enjoy gambit
---
What!? That's awesome!! I've literally blessed about 5 people now and all have come back saying they got it!!
---
I'm pretty sure that's been around for a while unless this is without damage buffs at all
---
Lake of Shadows Nightfall exclusive loot, primary grenade launcher, Militias Birthright. 
---
Nah, what you're seeing is the massive influx of folk getting the gun. It will blend into the meta soon enough, they can't compete at range.
---
He‚Äôs sick and tired of giving people their grenade back almost instantly just to have them forego it‚Äôs use and wait for their super. 
---
Oh god yes! Have an upvote . 
---
grats on the early access for penumbra
---
I guess that's a fair first point, but to your last point I mean the people just asking straight up I want this weapon where do I get it? I doubt it's not Googleable. 
---
Im just curious about the phenomenon haha, guessing you're up to date and can't really speak to what's going on in their blue boi brains.
---
Yep. I see the same comments on every post about it. Some guy said he spent 10 HOURS on step 2. That‚Äôs ridiculous. I don‚Äôt think he knows what end of the gun shoots bullets. 
---
it's. a. hip. fire. gun.
---
That was already possible before the buff..............
---
I personally dont mind the super itself, it's just the people who use it just solo blade barrage if they are about to lose an engagement. I dont remember there ever being a complaint in d2 about solo nova bomb.
---
Yeah, I guess that‚Äôs a good way to think about it 
---
***Does this tram go to Tahiti!?"***
---
Get on the Discord LFG people always posting for groups
---
You obviously lack the ability to sense sarcasm as well
---
I laughed way harder than I should 
---
You posted before that you're a nova bomb warlock. Go top tree, stack any super mods you have, USE SKULL OF DIRE ANKARA (spelling optional), do not charge grenades unless super is full (charging pauses super charging), stack mobility as high as possible, use blink, use any lightframe weapon you can to run faster,  dont worry about your rifts unless it synergizes well with some perk or something, maybe slap a radar mod on the light frame weapon, then run Mayhem. Literally just jump and dodge and avoid all conflicts. When super is full, huck it towards something as quickly as possible. You really don't want to hold on to it for very long. It's okay to just throw it towards an open area you think there may be dudes by the time it reaches them. Hide as much as possible and blink away or through hostile areas or when being pursued. If a hunter uses blade barrage (learn the sound too!) Be airborne and fucking blink, it is the most effective method I've found for dodging that shit. For the first pvp part where dying puts you back, the hiding, mobility, and blink are imperative. I would use a weapon you're great with based on the effective range of the map, as a defensive tool only. The second part where you need medals, same method is effective, maybe try to engage more behind and above your teammates with the bomb.
---
I don‚Äôt but whatever you want to believe 
---
Correct
---
Its honestly a good idea to get some of these guys in PvP, I hated it just last week but started grinding Luna‚Äôs, I‚Äôm addicted. Got through step 2 while grinding in &lt;hour
---
Thanx! My favourite part is where the prime evil stomps me into the air and the invader kills my team lol
---
Then why can you ads? It can be used both ways. 
---
I'm not naming names, but a while ago there was a highly upvoted post here about some player who thought heroic PEs happened at random. In the comments were a lot of people asking how to make PEs heroic. I linked one person to a guide showing how, and they thanked me and wondered why they were getting downvoted. I said it was because this is one of the most easily googled things in the whole game. They said this:
---
&gt;Maybe so, but it's a lot easier, faster, and efficient to write up a quick comment and (hopefully) receive a succinct. helpful response than have to search for, read, and digest a bunch of information online.
---
But I suppose it's easier to go their route, than simply help new players and answer their questions.
---
I expressed doubt that it was actually better in any way, because there was one hour between their initial question and my answer. They said this:
---
&gt;I'm not "waiting" for that hour. I spent 10 seconds writing a comment, go do other things, then another 10 seconds reading the reply.
---
It's also more efficient (generally) to ask questions of people who know what they're talking about and can nicely summarize relevant information, vs someone who doesn't know what they're talking about having to find and digest information.
---
There's also the "social" part of this; wanting to participate in some way in a community, hence the phrasing I used, as opposed to just something like "What are heroic public events"
---
Are you referring to the speaker? The dude in white?
---
He was just as unimportant as he was in D1 lol. And they even show it. He just wasted Ghaul's time. Believe me, no one really cared for him. 
---
Cayde on the other hand...
---
I agree that most of the time the coordinated 4 stack will win; but people need to stop getting into games against them and immediately thinking it‚Äôs a loss. I‚Äôve lost as a 4 stack to randoms many times and also won against 4 stacks while solo queuing many times. If you want that luna‚Äôs then you gotta bring your A game and ruin the 4 stack‚Äôs day.
---
Say what you want about Zavala or Uldren, but get Lord Shaxx's name out of your mouth.  If he wants grenades give him more grenades.
---
I'm not great at PvP unless I use KB/M, and felt too lazy for that and used this method to do both pvp parts.
---
I don't like Crucible because I'm a newer player so I'm completely outmatches by nearly everybody based on Gear alone and I'm a big fan of PvP coming down to skill, not gear, so I don't play PvP.
---
Hahaha
---
In PvE, when you wipe, you don‚Äôt respawn where you left off. You respawn at your last checkpoint. Taking 1% off for dying isn‚Äôt even that bad. 
---
Googleable lol I‚Äôm only here for this 
---
Either a titan or Saitama. Take your pick 
---
Yep, new striker super upgrade is also a godsend.
---
\- It doesn't matter what flinch is like in those other games, because they're different games. D1 and D2 are not the same game, and to me it looks like snipers had too little flinch there.
---
\- I find that it doesn't really promote camping, because it doesn't work, you always have to change up your position.  The most promoted style is deathball and running around with a shotgun in small maps. Not camping.
---
\- I said Baken because he's an obvious example.
---
I kind of find it funny that you're complaining about flinch from scout rifles? The flinch from LMG's, auto-rifles, weapons with high caliber rounds is way worse.
---
Snipers are in a fairly good state, especially with LW. It's a high skill, high reward weapon; it's not supposed to be something you can use while being constantly under-fire. Even then the flinch is very predictable at least for me, unless I'm getting shot by an LMG usually aiming down does the trick. 
---
The only place I can see flinch being an issue is consoles but that's a different story.
---
Its Steven crowder he has a YouTube channel and it's from his change my mind series.
---
Not a big fan of beeing a support
---
As shocking as it sounds... some people want to have a discussion.  Google gets old after a while.  Some people just want to have an interaction with someone.  So, yeah.  It's strange that you are complaining about people who are trying to learn something and better themselves.
---
Did your brightness get turned down by accident?
---
In fairness anyone who thinks you can be at a distance where punching it burns your hand but the rest of your body is at a safe distance is just as dumb 
---
Use suroises regiaeamwbbej
---
It‚Äôs a gun that had a history in only PvP, and is still a PvP gun. Not trying to be a dick, but the quest step isn‚Äôt even that hard. You literally only need to maintain above a 0.5kda to complete it. Not to mention streaks increase the % as well. Now the medals one is annoying but it‚Äôs not impossible. If your really desperate for it just bait your teammates and then avenge them.
---
So you probably finished by now, but for everyone else, when you find ish the event immediately pull up the map and fast travel back to the area. This should let you do the event twice.
---
[This is a continually updated set of charts](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-01-30-destiny-2-exotics-list-exotic-weapon-exotic-armour-4747) that shows how to get all exotics, including the ones from quests. I recommend doing some exotic quests, and all the pre-Forsaken random drops can be gotten from Xur. Xur is a hidden NPC who appears on a different planet every Friday, sells exotics, and disappears the following Tuesday. 
---
Not probably. Absolutely 100% definitely.
---
I agree, but people don't want to discuss that. They only want to talk about how hard they think completing the requirements are.
---
That should be edited to say: "Get OEM."
---
Its nice little to no effort and still most important
---
Not complaining, just curious my friend. I think there are more interesting conversations to be had. Apologies for the misleading title.
---
Fixed
---
Yea
---
Yes, resilience and recovery matter, more than mobility.  
---
Mobility has nothing to do with how fast you run, but has to do with straffing and jumps mostly (I believe this is correct, but someone will correct me if I'm wrong).  Even then, you will not notice a big difference unless you have exteremly high mobility.
---
Resilience is related to the amount of damage you can take and your overshield.  The higher this number is the harder it becomes for someone to oneshot you.  You want this to be at a minimum of 3, but 5 is much better.
---
Recovery is related to how quickly to start to recover from damage.  The higher then number, the quicker you start to recover.  Again you want this to be at least a 3. 
---
I thought he got booted from Redeem for his shitty attitude?
---
It's funny bc they aren't even good üòÇ most ppl I see with TLW are using a sniper or shotgun and those using a sniper rarely even use it or get shots. It's basically useless. 
---
Right? You only need to maintain a kda of 0.5 to complete it. If that‚Äôs really as difficult as they make it seem then you getting the weapon is kinda pointless.
---
I for one am glad it‚Äôs a pvp sided quest, it was in d1 and it was a lot harder. I myself am horrible at crucible but it encourages me to play crucible even though I don‚Äôt want to lol 
---
This is nowhere near the level of a pinnacle weapon quest. It‚Äôs perfectly fine where it is right now.
---
It is agreeable that bonus damage is negligible. However, the bad player doesn't need to be top tier with OEM. 1 kill or prolonged life is VERY powerful in competitive play where lives may be scare if not used cautiously or efficiently.
---
I think people asking questions is great, and I encourage people to do so. However, I prefer if people put at least a little bit of effort into figuring things out for themselves beforehand. I try to always say how I found something out, so that others know it is possible and maybe start to see what sort of cues they should look for in-game. 
---
Do them both.  Every class has advantages &amp; disadvantages.  Having all three will also help lvl everything up quicker.   If you have forsaken, unless you have already used it, use the booster on one to get it to lvl 30 quickly.  Then work on the other.

PRAISE GERALDO

CDPR GOOD

I have The Last Word, and didn't have much trouble with shards and blade barrage in mayhem to get past the crucible step, my only problem with step 2 is that it wasn't step 4, if they loved that step to later in the quest it would've kept player morale up, instead you hit a brick wall that while passable is in fact a brick wall, you have to topple it and you should have to topple it at some point I just don't think that it should've been the first step in the crucible.
---
Exotic quests ramp up to the hard part
---
a pinnacle weapon is a slog through and through as it should be
---
this treated an exotic quest like a pinnacle weapon then became easy right after that step 
---
Oh yeah
---
I‚Äôve almost always fired while ADS.  Never really had a problem controlling it.
---
def dont care enough
---
-Vu vu vala
---
Who are you?  The Question Master?
---
I am pve player an it was not hard... just stupid boring. Anyway they should   advertise this gun like pvp. I am not going for redrix or hc. LW is subpar exotic in pve. 
---
shh the sun's sleeping
---
Yeah no clue. 
---
I agree it's fine, each step is fine, but steps 4 and 2 should've been swapped so you didn't hit the hardest part right away, the rest you can just grind out no matter your skill level, the last check should've been worthiness to use it, not the first.
---
this is from a game design perspective, not the perspective of somebody giving another person a gun
---
OMG. It's like I'm talking to my fiancee. 
---
Oh wait. He plays Titan. 
---
I only have 2 characters.  Refuse to make a 3rd.  I do know the whole ordeal with the powerful frames.   It's just dropping - tbh I don't care too much about it, next month that Division 2 drops and Destiny will be put aside.   Not bashing, just facts. 
---
You forgot Cayde-gon.
---
I think we ‚ÄúPvE players‚Äù just can‚Äôt admit we‚Äôre shit at PvP so we make ourselves feel better by thinking that we‚Äôre somehow good at PvE instead of just inferior
---
I prefer warlock myself, mainly because the health regen starts faster and regens quicker, so you don't need to avoid dmg for quite so long to get your health back up. That and the healing class ability.
---
With that said though, I'd still start a char of all the classes, not saying you have to level them all, just long enough to figure out which one you like the best.
---
I‚Äôm more of a blast furnace kind of guy I prefer to end the shotgun menace without joining it
---
Sure, but what‚Äôs the difference? Either way step 2 tests your ‚Äúworthiness‚Äù, that doesn‚Äôt really change whether it‚Äôs at the start or end.
---
Literally everyone who's played Rise of Iron
---
 The best balance would be "either/or" eg:  
---
Complete 10 clash matches or 10 heroic strikes  
---
Either Kill 100 opponents in pvp or 1000 enemies in NFs  
---
Think that would be a better option as you can play to your strengths without it feeling like too much of a ball ache 
---
ive been using them with my lw snipe and getting some nice snipes, the pants really help with the last word. Im on Xbox btw
---
I‚Äôm trying to process what happened here because I don‚Äôt play titan. Was it an exotic or something that made that possible?
---
Warlock only has one class dedicated to support
---
The rest is pure damage. That is one of the biggest misconceptions with warlock; that they are the support class.
---
They are not.
---
no but making progress raises morale, raised morale means way less people complaining about the step on reddit.
---
O so you mean just like destiny community then? lol do you not see the irony in that comment 
---
No need to be butthurt lol, they're just opinions. A post/ user can't stop someone from asking whatever they want
---
Oh, no, I just like to help newer players, so I see and answer a lot of questions. This is just my opinion, I'm not saying it's wrong to ask questions at all! I do see a lot of questions where asking others seems a weird decision, though, like people asking what the perks on their ghost shell do, or what Finest Matterweave does. The ones who asked those questions were apparently unaware of details coming up when you hover over a perk/item. I am fine with the majority of questions, but some, like those, just seem a little too much. 
---
It was even easier using an AR, too. They're monsters in the new sandbox, and people still continue to shotgun ape. Double and triple downs all night. Didn't finish under 20 kills in any matches.
---
luckily i got jotunn to drop today. went ham in rumble 
---
 Whisper can also be used without scoping.
---
That doesn't mean its smart to do so.
---
Mostly pve oriented on this one, just was the only decent roll I‚Äôve gotten
---
I see what you're saying when it comes to heroics. Personally when I first played, I didn't know how they worked. But the way I learned was from other people doing it in in game and if that didn't work I looked up the name of the public. 
---
Back when this game launched, figuring out the heroics were what made the heroics (which you don't need a tutorial to find) heroic to me.
---
I was like wait there's heroics? How do? And eventually figured it out through searches, observation, and in game conversation with my friends like I said.
---
The example that I've seen most so far is heroics in this thread. I think that's not really that big of a deal bc there's quests out there that ask for a heroic. If you think it's just rng or you don't know how to do it, sure ask someone about it, even if maybe you could look for how do I do a heroic for x public, to me that's logical but I get wanting a discussion about it because that's how I basically figured it out by talking to friends and paying attention to other information sources. From there I was able to apply what I've learned to everything else. 
---
Example: I know heroics exist after learning about them by playing (do secondary unnamed objective) forsaken comes out. I find an Ether ritual. I guess the heroic is to shoot the purple ghost balls bc nothing is telling me to do it. 
---
Again nbd, that kind of convo is waranted, especially for solo players without people to figure it out with them. I'm not sure if there should be an in game guide because figuring it out for yourself has always been a part of what makes a heroic a heroic.
---
 I'm trying to talk about posts that look like if you copied and pasted into a search you'd find what you're looking for. It just doesn't make sense to me and it's why I asked. 
---
Riiiight
---
xd
---
except if he wants to get all the exotics. which makes this quest kinda bull, even if it is supposed to be pvp focused.
---
It‚Äôs last word lmao 
---
Says the guy judging someone they dont know off of one comment thread ü§®ü§î so you are a hypocrite as well
---
You don't need a tutorial to find publics*
---
In all this confusion I've forgotten if I reset the transmat
---
If I were you I would get Forsaken, play that and see if you feel like you need more content.  Then you could buy the Annual Pass fro Black armory and soon to be released Jokers Wild!
---
You need forsaken to buy the annual pass. The difference is forsaken is the ‚Äúbase‚Äù year 2 content, while the annual pass is what gives you access to year 2s DLCs (Black Armory, Jokers Wild, and Penumbra). The DLC are not currently able to be purchased separately, and very well may never be.
---
LMAOOO YEAH ME AND MY BOYS WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT THAT LOLOLOL
---
I stopped playing destiny for a couple weeks vecause this happened to my now i lock all my gear.
---
Already heard and posted there. Want me to remove this or not?
---
I almost feel like it's random every strike. I'll go one strike with Crooked Fang and never have to switch weapons because I'm swimming in ammo. Next strike I can't even use it because I get absolutely no ammo.
---
I mainly play PvE and the hardest part of the entire quest was legit waiting for witches ritual
---
Not real sure if that's an overwatch reference, probably more a reference to where overwatch got it from. Old time cowboy duels usually happened at high noon.  Though Overwatch has definitely made it popular again.
---
98% I f destiny players won‚Äôt get this..
---
You didn't hip fire. You are not worthy.
---
I have shards, and queenbreaker, and a bunch of forsaken exotics..and I play a few hours a week at most..:) mind changed?
---
please
---
for the sake of our sanity
---
Fortnite didn‚Äôt create the floss dance and high noon isn‚Äôt an overwatch reference.  It‚Äôs a time when the sun is it‚Äôs highest. 
---
You might want to try use it from the hip.. like it's intended to be used.
---
Because there's barely any recoil without ADS.
---
You can preview the contents of the current season's bright engrams to see what they can give you. This season's are Etched Engrams. You can get shaders that aren't listed, but I don't know if you can get any other items that aren't listed. 
---
If something does not show up under the list of things in the bright engram, you can see if it is in the Prismatic Matrix or in the weekly rotation of items you can buy for bright dust, or the packages you can buy for silver. 
---
This specific ornament was pre order only, as the other comment says. 
---
&gt;Every cosmetic upgrade is pooled in one giant loot pool, kinda frustrating.
---
I never played RuneScape, so I'm not sure what you mean. This ornament was never in the loot pool to begin with. Holiday events have separate loot pools, and each season has its own loot pool. 
---
Hipfiring at max sensitivity is the way to do it.
---
I left the last destiny because every player complained nerf to everything. Its strong as fuck in close range. Because that's where it should be strong. Like every weapon is strong at the ranged they're supposed to be strong at. 
---
It took me 10 ;-; on the 11th life, I got down to the last part, and just chanted ‚ÄúI fucking got this. I won‚Äôt miss. I fucking got this. I won‚Äôt miss‚Äù and lo and behold, I got it. I was about to cry lmfao 
---
Hell I‚Äôm below average and finished the quest line in 4-5 hours. I just decided to be super sweaty with ace/retold/oem and do some rumble to be brain dead as I control heavy with hammerhead
---
I have one as well and had to put a rampage spec on it to make it thru the reload and keep rampage and even then you have like 2-3 sec to get another kill
---
Afaik, each resilience point raises your HP by 2. So at 10 res you should have 200 HP instead of 180
---
The explosions do still happen it‚Äôs just that the damage from hitting the actual knives a a target was slightly reduced
---
No
---
Let me guess, you‚Äôre shotty didn‚Äôt work?
---
Which raid? 
---
Last wish
---
Damn, haven‚Äôt played through that yet. Sorry dude 
---
maybe, I think their are a lot of people that feel entitled and are acting like brats, but there are a few fair criticisms that should be heard. I feel those criticisms are being lost in the squabble of the masses that do feel entitled.
---
This happened with me, meatball twice in a row first one dropped ship second one sparrow 
---
the missions themselves were fun and easy to understand which made them easy excersises. I like the missions though.
---
there isn't much progression in dreaming city really, activities you can do rotate each week. but outside of the introductory mission, and the weekly mission you can buy from Petra. Everything else you can do anytime provided it's active during that week.
---
You do not need the annual pass for anything to do with the Dreaming City. 
---
The Dreaming City depends on you being able to set goals for yourself. For a start, look at the bounties and quest steps Petra has, and do those. Some are very vague, and if you don't already know the area well, will require google. For example, the Ascendant Challenge weekly bounty has a hint on it about where to go, but the hint will make no sense if you don't know the names of the areas and lost sectors. 
---
Assuming you‚Äôve finished the story, you should do the daily and weekly bounties/missions from Petra, such as the weekly rotating mission, the ascendant challenge, etc. 
---
still it wasn't a fear of strangers honesly, it was a joke that was considered to by the damn Dictator Mods to be "transphobic" even though it was legit calling one of the warframes called Nezha a trap and THAT WAS IT.
---
You could try looking in /r/destinysherpa, /r/fireteams, or /r/fireteamsPS4. 
---
Last Hand is an Ace of Spades ornament
---
I have been playing Destiny for all of 3 weeks after playing Warframe since mid 2014 (Loki Prime Access), but go ahead and be a dumb ass, just reinforces my opinion of the Warframe "community".
---
&gt;about stats and percentages
---
You have to be fucking kidding.  "Over there"?  You mean in the game that hasn't had difficult content in pretty much for ever?  Let me guess, you think something like Elite Sanctuary Onslaught is hard?  Two+ hour long survivals?  Nightmare Trial (before they removed it)?  Been there, done that, guess what?  It can all be done with ease and it can all be done with shit I have had for a year or more.  There is literally zero reason to even get any of the new frames, or weapons, because there is zero content I cannot steamroll with what I have.
---
This map was among my favorites in d1.
---
You mean hand cannons and no other archetype of gun. 
---
100 % . Best Sniper map ever
---
Sir u would pay 500 fucking dollars for that
---
Mcree: It‚Äôs high noon
---
The D2 Community: ThE dRiFtEr SaYs ThAt
---
If i was xour enemy i would stop playing after that move cause this game is so fcking balance
---
Some odd way of holding the gun with two hands maybe? Or maybe a safeguard for the left hand so it doesnt get knocked out.
---
It‚Äôs what I switched back to 
---
what‚Äôs that first sniper?
---
Seriously though! It accommodated all play styles so well! I miss this map so much. When I think of ideal destiny pvp. This map is the map I picture everything on.
---
It‚Äôs fine, was a fun match aside from going 8 and 22. Made my day better when I saw three of you comment with sorry.
