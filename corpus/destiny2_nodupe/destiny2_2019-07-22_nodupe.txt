Thunder lord fully spun up does more then hammerhead with boss spec...
---

---
But then again HMGs are terrible for boss DPS, worse then specials
---
During tie breaker in gambit; blade barrage with Shards. As long as you don’t die, endless super. Melting point does help though.
---
How did you match up against my team

Sorry I thought I replied to this. DM me, we might be able to coordinate something. We'll go into more detail in DM.

Well thank you, unfortunately I've been trying for months lol

bungie on the left, activision on the right

I'm literally not even on that quest step yet though is the issue

I think it's the Edge Transit

I’ve been waiting so long for this, my life is complete. Thank you

You’ve already posted this.

I think u have to do the weekly Gambit prime bounties to upgrade ur synth

It’s double Valor next week

Mountaintop, Izanagis, Threat Level (with trench barrel), imperial decree (with trench barrel or Swashbuckler) or Arbalest if you hate shields

Ah so. It would be interesting iffn we touched on tranquility bay during shadow keep. See I'd rhe lander is still there.
---
What’s ur take on the gun? That’s all I wanna talk about. Not the fact that I called it gay. And not the fact that that bothers you for some reason
---
My only issue with this post is the idea that barricade is the best class ability. Both barricades and rifts have a cast animation that holds you in place so you need to use them preemptively and your enemies can just bail before you get any benefit, whereas dodge has the shortest cooldown and can be used actively to change your hitbox mid gunfight AND reload your gun/refresh your melee ability or both with Dragon' Shadow. The best boot perk in the game Distribution is only really great on hunters since you need to be near an enemy while using your class ability to get any of the benefits and that's a death sentence for both other classes.
---
Fuck titans Fuck bungie
---
Funny thing is I’m having more fun on destiny 2 then warframe
---
I'm not a shotgun guy so I'm not exactly sure.  I'm a sniper guy.  That's just the gun I've seen the most for shotguns at my rank.  That's what kills me significantly more than any other shotgun.
---
 I hate myself for losing faith in bungie. So hyped for season eight.
---
Who the hell cares? It's mats
---
Congrats Man! I just hit heroic 1. I’m afraid to play now
---
Ace of Spades. It’s an obvious answer, but Momento Mori and Firefly are sexy at clearing out hordes.

How can you tell?
---
  **They look the exact fucking same!**
---
Banshees bounties had me using cold heart yesterday and we played a few gambit matches. It straight melted even the big ass yellow bar guys. Then ran a few reckoner matches right after and the burn was solar so I decided to try out Prometheus​ Lens. I completely forgot that it auto reloads after a kill and it melted the same way. Those are going to be my new goto for gambit.
---
My take is that facing the gun is fine and easily countered. Is it cheesy sure but the majority know to dodge it. And if you don’t want people to have something to say about a comment you made the internet is not the right place for you bud. Especially when it’s a comment made from a place of ignorance
---
I noticed it too but wasn't sure why.
---
You're riding it backwards
---
Holy fuck that 2nd snipe
---
I like that gun too, but it doesn't produce orbs. I'd like to provide some super energy to the team as I'm taking down adds.
---
Nothing, I asked you if you were on PC. That doesn't have anything to do with him.
---
And Fuck you.
---
I don't really think it's a problem. People can play more than one game at a time, and there are similarities between the two games. I can understand why they might say "if you like Destiny you might enjoy this too."
---
Yea I just watch my team run in and get prefired by it. I treat it like it’s a sniper don’t peak it and don’t play lateral against it. I don’t give a shit if it’s ignorant tho. I grew up talkin like I do and that jotunn is fucking gay as shit
---
It wouldn't be a shader. It would be a button in the infusion/mod slot area where you inspect it and it shows you what to do, similar to a catalyst.
---
Now if I could just be able to do that consistently, guarantee the next match I was whiffing on people who were not moving and looking the other way lol
---
When destiny 2 PC moves to steam will it retain specific region servers and if so how will it work and how will we change them. On battle net it’s annoying to have to change login and server if you join a fireteam with a group on NA or EU but at least the options there.
---
On steam I haven’t seen other games with an easy toggle when there’s been multiple servers and friends list and most games can match across D2 regions as far as I’ve seen. It would be great to not have to switch anymore but  if anyone knows how this will work please let me know.
---
I prefer using bad juju or Austringer with recluse and either wendigo or tractor cannon. I main a Nightstalker Tether however.   I use the tether for ad clear and save tractor cannon or wendigo for bosses. Bad juju to recover super and stompees for the speed and being able to shave off time during periods that are just running
---
I second Hazard of the Cast for the Breakneck quest.
---
Honestly, I rarely ever run into Hammer Titans in PVP. Could be that I’m on Console, however.
---
Oppressor MKII anyone?
---
Oh dear Neptune,not again.NOT AGAIN!
---
on a side note, Video confirms what people keep thinking is not true. **Cross Counter only works with 1 specific punch**. Love the comic by the way. Your face expressions have so far been top tier in comics for me. Everything else is getting up there too. I love it.
---
God I wish
---
I'm farming it. Ran it 13 times today. My wife got it on the second run and she went to take care of the kid so I soloed the boss fight. She's an RNG queen when it comes to nightfall drops.

you got a source? I'd love to see that

Then how would you stop by a public event flag for heavy and super energy?

Give us the option for both then? Lol

Use lfg. It will save your sanity. You don't even have to communicate for this mission

My entire comp experience

I like the look of the mask...

Do you know where the puzzle is from? Maybe I can get a little bit more information. Never saw it before
---
Are they still guessing eyes or can you "cheese" riven solo now? I took a break from destiny and havent been in the loop for a while
---
Wait does that mean he’s chilling like on the moon hiding?
---
I just got that same thing it’s really good for pvp
---
Probably by dying more often then you are getting kills.
---
Better be 160
---
I wish I had your luck. I can hold my own against the sweats in QP but the moment I go to Comp I get stomped.

---
Liar’s handshake is the reason I use arcstrider so much
---
Speedy titans? Are you referring to titan skating on pc?
---
If you weren't trash and played on PS4 this wouldn't be an issue :)
---
It wouldn't, it would be pointless, and no one is asking for it, at least not constrained to exotics
---
Exotic shaders, that can be placed on any gun or armor piece (although at a higher price of course), including any legendaries that we love to use, would be a better idea
---
Exotics are exotic on due to their design, catysts and how they work
---
Rarity and a special exotic unique "Shader" slot won't make justify an exotic as exotic
---
Holy shit dude good job! I'm soloing my way to it, hope you had a quick streak in there
---
I'm sorry you feel that way.
---
I don't have a Nintendo. Seriously if you could make a video and send me a link I would love to watch it
---
That me every time but hey at least I'm wearing my lunafaction boots lol
---
The Prometheus was great. I got it as a drop right when curse dropped and I loved it. Then it got nerfed
---
Broadsword is something any crucible player can do casually it’s easy rn because pulse rifles are in a good place. LH &amp; NF take more dedication because all progress is done through comp but is easier because of their recent nerf although in higher comp you will still run into 4-stacks of LH/NF,dusk rock, wardcliff load-outs  but all you need is a 180 and you will win 90% of the engagements. Recluse is just another fabled seasonal reward like claymore in season 3, hitting fabled takes skill unless you find a team to carry you, you will be a hindrance to the blueberries you match with if you cannot provide support with the communication handicap. Revoker should have been a fabled reward on top of making it a comp on progression, anyone could line up a shot but it’s funny how many times I’d be on a 1v1 with a sniper and they’d hesitate the shot and I’d clean them up it takes skill. I know they wanted to make comp more enjoyable for casual players but it’s not call competitive for nothing
---
It happened to me for the first year and a half of destiny 2 but I bought an Ethernet cord an it hasn’t happened sense forsaken launched
---
man come back in two years get -8 down votes
---
You don't need the same post twice in an hour.
---
If they are using the lord of wolves, absolutely.
---
More like “Moblin the Goblin”.
---
I’d actually use that
---
Am Dredgen. Can confirm.
---
Thanks 😊
---
Same. I haven’t ran into it in like two weeks
---
Do the Civic Duty bounties the Drifter offers. Across all 3 characters, you can get up to 360 infamy per day (I think - pretty sure it's 30 infamy per bounty, but I haven't even talked to Drifter for weeks, so I might be wrong) without even touching Gambit.
---
This week i get the ship, now i only need to complete LW, never done it.
---
Alright, see ya.
---
I don't know...
---
I found it so pleasing because it doesn't do that in the first place, like it would normally do.
---
The only thing missing imo is the warp loading screen really, to top it off real nice.
---
damn. September's where it's at.
---
Frakin did that today...
---
As a forsaken dredgen( got dredgen when the title drop during forsaken)  can attest that gambit suck, rekoning really need a buff and follow menagerie style loot grind
---
Who is she?
---
NPC that gives exotics for a limited time, rotates weekly, available only on asian servers and lets you use her inventory if you are playing from gaming cafe. 
---
Why she is important? 
---
She has some lore behind. She lost everything and that drives her to help guardians in need.
---
I disagree, I love breakneck in Gambit - I’ve been using it since I got it
---
Seems to be around 27-30%
---
Lmao a great place to stop for the night on reddit thank you for the good ending.
---
Big oof
---
It takes much longer.
---
That's Jupiter tho.
---
Many people on Youtube do things like super comaprisons and gear meta. There is also a bot on Discord that tracks clan stats, it may not have everything but I think you'd like it, if I remember its called Charlemagne.
---
At this point i just kinda lift up my "sync" emote and hope to God they spare me and sync with me.
---
Long story short, it's a known bug right now, and I assume bungie is looking at fixing it. 
---
(get ready for lots of people telling you to use the search bar though)
---
Lmao seriously? Arbitrations, sorties, orb vallis (I think) , eidolon hunting are all end game content. I'm pretty sure there's more that I missed too.
---
To me is ridiculous that our super not only destroy titans buble, but kill the people inside the bubble.  The damage number is 99999 I believe.  Bungie somehow decided that if a unstopable blade meets an immovable shield (the Irresistible Force Paradox).. the blade not only destroy the shield but kill the greek guy behind.
---
dude you are literally using the same super as them... dont think you can complain that much
---
Oh that German Shaxx ... #Shudders#
---
Sorry about that Guardian! :3
---
To be honest...didn't realized that. I'll check out when I'll have time!
---
Or khepris sting just strait up poisoning them
---
Lol no worries, it's a fun thread x)
---
I have like 10x them than all of my other mats combined wtf
---
always the same, never works, i s wrong!
---
 always the same, never works, i s wrong!
---
What’s funny here is a tether hunter would have died there. He/she would have tethered and in the time for it to work, both supers would have hit him/her and then it would work...but suppression grenades work instantly...sounds about right
---
I play gambit prime a good amount and most of the games are pretty balanced. Most times the enemy gets their boss first we still end up winning, even if we were trailing a good amount
---
i s wrong! never works lwy samemei s wrong! never works lwy samemei s wrong! never works lwy sameme
---
no i ca ffno oo o no i ca ffno oo o no i ca ffno oo o no i ca ffno oo o no i ca ffno oo o
---
When there's a gambit for solos only and one for full teams, I'll play it again
---
Ah yes, the OEM/LoW titan. A modern classic.
---
Love this one
---
The bug, the ship or the background?
---
Tractor cannon because its a lot better for helping dps in raids . Orpheus rig recently received a nerf and its not as helpful as it was before compared to tractor cannon.
---
My clan and I just finished for the first time the Scourge of the Past raid (Only grenade launchers).Is DARCI better than the DPS of the grenade launchers? And Outbreak?
---
Also, good strategy. We used the same one but kinda rotating from the place the boss is in the picture. Angular - over a building (in front of Parallel in the picture) and the other two between the two buildings where the boss is. The problem was when IP just wanted to be an idiot and faced a wall or something like that.
---
How does that seem unfair? Do you get a free ticket to a movie sequel because you bought a ticket to the first one?
---
The only times I've ever backed out of a game have been on gambit and it's because tones have dropped on my pager. I've ridden out every single shitty comp game I've been in. I guess people leave because it saves their streak? Idk. But Bungie's radio silence on Comp/Crucible issues as a whole frustrates me to no end.
---
“reported for hacking” 😂😂😂
---
i am totally loving that shader!
---
Take a look for a good 5 seconds, its second from the left.
---
haha it would be cool but no. I now understand the reasoning behind it
---
Ancient Repost im afraid
---
Pretty much. They could see I even had my super ready but I figured what's the point. Took my execution as honorably as Stannis the Mannis.
---
Where you getting them from? Neither are being sold by Xur.
---
How did it go?
---
Shader plz
---
Ah ok. But is it that efficent? i mean i farmed mine with the vendor quests on the planet with 3 chars and a ghost with combo finder. so i could get in around 2 to 3 hours per day around 100 to 150 mats from each Planet. so it took me around 5 redest to buy all (expect bright dust) tributs.
---
Actually, before you try other LFG methods, first use xbox's built-in LFG tool and see if it works. Every player I know uses it exclusively, so you're more likely to find a fireteam on there.
---
Hit guide, tab left twice, select Looking For Group, select Destiny 2, browse posts or create your own. It's pretty simple to use, and very effective. You'll have a fireteam within minutes.
---
It's really cool
---
Yep, looking back on it that 2nd snipe was cool but I'm pretty sure he would've fallen to his death anyways lmao
---
he went on a 3 loss streak
---
I love hearing German if it's supposed to be German, but poor voice acting just makes movies and games silly.
---
The bug, but it’s all quite nice lol
---
Yeah the Fallen are cool.  They like hillbilly music.
---
It's just something you can set up and let the materials flow in while you're sleeping/working/schooling. You set it and forget it.
---
Happened to me yesterday. Ended up slaughtering the entire enemy team twice. They just kept coming.
---
and i just wrote a poem.
---
Yep, all it took was 3 pikes and a ton of willpower.
---
Lol apparently nobody likes you. But you don’t care because trash needs no friends.
---
You got one if you bought a physical copy of the game very early on or pre ordered, but it was never exclusive.
---
You need 15k infamy compared to 2k in valor to reset. Once you're in the legend division in Gambit, which is 12k infamy, you can only gain infamy via wins or completing bounties.
---
Ah yes, thank you for your wonderful insight. Through the power of the Warmeme dlc quest, he can obtain the Wormgods Caress, a diamond in the rough for us titans but I shall guide him down the path of upmost glorious 1hko throwing hammers and unlimited ad control
---
You can. Just switch the entire system language to English.
---
Oh also. The only other way to stand a chance against a team of choas reaching geomag wearing warlocks is to get on your team one warlock with a well for no reloads and rest of team with wendigo or swarm of ravens and once all heavy ammo is depleted everyone switch to mountaintops and with no reload times you can delete the boss almost as fast. Not quite as fast but almost and if you have an invader distracting them you really have a chance. But again it's rare to have everyone using that setup and working together.
---
Was talking just talking about my sniper, but okay.
---
Some of us aren’t fortunate enough to have loaded question. Also some of us are too lazy to get our 100 fusion rifle kills and 150 arc kills that we have left. I might do that today actually.
---
He literally said he's grinding for revoker. He's sniping and snipe/shotty isn't a great loadout
---
*\*Proceeds to kill any guardians that enter and burns down the throne world\**
---
Well if that's what you need to do to hit fabled...
---
I was a blade barrage hunter with inaugural address and sturn
---
Athelflad-D is the very first pistol in the sidearms collection. What two sidearms is it between?
---
Where’s your ornament for the tractor cannon, Mr. OG?
---
So true. In my experience the first one to Primevil in Prime loses because they constantly get invaded, and slammed with blockers
---
HANDS!
---
I like gambit prime more than gambit, mainly because it's a lot faster and still gives you something even if you lose.
---
Yknow what a helical magazine is right it's like a drum minus the raised feed lips to be inserted into a weapon the handcannons could feed like a calico 950
---
Let’s change the subject then since you are my internet professor
---
Quality post. They're just feeling inferior when they see the perfect male form in all its glory
---
SHOOT THE HANDS!!

Yeah but *BOSS STOMP*
---
I demand a video
---
Don't have a  switch D:
---
I thought we already established my lack of caring you think if I cared about my karma I would of not deleted the op comment and kept egging you on
---
Yeah for sure, but Bodying a super to death vs a headshot are pretty substantial skill differentials.
---
Stagger my boy
---
What was his setup?
---
Download the destiny 2 app and you can lfg for people to play with time of the day is a factor for your ability to find a fireteam so keep that in mind
---
Wowww lmao. Pretty accurate
---
Which JoJo, or is it all of them?
---
Yeah, makes it a pain to grind for infamy
---
Also not everyone will be a fit for you but the cool thing about the games recent popularity is that it has about 800k to 1m players daily so eventually you’ll find a good fit
---
You have to purchase content to be able to play it. Licensing issues prevents your purchases from being used on multiple platforms.
---
This is great !!
---
Honestly the best song to come out of D2 year one.
---
At close range vs far range.
---
Ok thanks
---
Lol. I’ve no doubt you lack any caring of karma. Reddit karma or otherwise. But the karma proves that you are the minority with your way of thinking. Meaning...I’m not the only one who thinks the way I do. 
---
We all know you don’t care. However, the karma just proves you’re a jerk.
---
This would be cool as like a sticker or pin
---
If i pre order shadowkeep, will i be able to get the base game instantly or do i have to wait untill september?
---
Damn boi he thicc!
---
No. I find this conversation amusing. Watching you squirm around trying to not look like an idiot is the most entertaining thing I’ve done all morning.
---
Everyone get ready for DPS!(nice drawing I like it!)
---
Ok what’s that suppose to make me feel bad welcome to 2019 white knight no one gives a shit
---
NOW IF ONLY LIAR'S HANDSHAKE WOULD DROP
---
You want to make all three.  Level them up and unlock the abilities.  Figure out which you like best.  They all have good features and are useful in different situations.  It is good to be well rounded in this game and have options, especially if you LFG certain activities.  Sometimes they want a specific character to round out their fireteam.  
---
Since you purchased Forsaken, you should have a character boost.  This will start a character at lvl 30, 300 light with Red War, COO, and Warmind campaign/missions all completed (orange &amp; blue missions, too).  Since you are up on the lore, you may want to start your first character with this and move on to the Forsaken campaign to get everything moving quick.  You can then start your other two characters and work through the campaigns to watch the cut sceens and listen to the story lines.
---
Some tips for starting out:
---
Save your highest light weapon at each lvl for your alts.  Just stick it in the vault when you get a higher lvl piece to equip.
---
Go see Hawthorne everytime you level up.  She will have an engery weapon and 3 armour pieces you can buy at a higher light until you get 200 light.  
---
If you find an XP ghost use it until you can buy fireteam medallions from Tess.  It will help you lvl up faster.
---
Follow the story line, do all the orange &amp; blue missions as you go.  They give good XP and the rewards are only rewarding if done during the missions.  Once you lvl up they become more of a chore to have to do. (Red War, COO, Warmind, Forsaken).  You will know where to go by looking at the side menu on the directors page or just look for the planet with the logo for the campaign section you are working on.
---
Pick up every planetary material and loot cashe you see.  You will need the glimmer and materials later.  You can not have to many materials (only exception is Baryon Boughs from Dreaming City).
---
Don't you just alternate dodges and punches? It's technically harder, yeah, but with timers that generous I really don't thinks so.
---
This comment would’ve been relevant 2 years ago, bad luck buddy

PC?
---
That sucks, I know how you feel though. But to be honest reckoning is a better option I’ve definitely gotten more spare rations to drop for me in Reckoning than gambit prime. Also, If you’re not on a time frame I’d just wait until double or triple infamy comes around to grind for 21%. That’s what I’m doing, just gonna 4 stack with some friends lol.
---
That’s why you get him in the right spot, that’s the way I’ve always done it, and if everyone stands there the boss will be looking over there
---
Ps4 I'm afraid
---
So do I get anything for paying for coo and warmind if they added it to forsaken for free and are about to just make them free anyway.
---
Someone prob downvoted because there is a raid sparrow, but the sparrow for cursebreaker comes from the weekly story mission.
---
In always looking and it's always the same. Either not good enough players or people want cash. Takes the piss
---
He was joking
---
DPSing with arcstrider is one of the hardest things to do as a hunter because it's really easy to 1. Miss the target on the pulse and 2. Accidentally throw a light attack instead of the pulse and have to start the attack over. With hunters it's just really easy to straight up miss all of our DPS options
---
What is IB

Mans literally be using King Crimson like wtf bro uncool

You can already do that with 3rd party apps. Bungie is satisfied leaving that kind of stuff to the API developers from what I can see as we are no closer to anything like that 5 years into the franchise.

because they have Korean or Japanese characters in there names. they could be from else where but i just assume.

No hate towards Asian players just noticed it happen more with people who have Asian characters in their names.

LOL there are HUNDREDS of weapons all with various god rolls. There isn't a master list of all of this data in one place. You should start specifying what you want.
---
You want pulse rifles? Ok, what are you going to be playing? PvE? PvP? What do you like in pulse rifles, faster firing? Or higher damage?
---
If you ask for more specific guns we can give some advice, but I can't list 200 guns with their god rolls for you. Nor do I believe a list exists like that.
---
I do.   Around 470ish
---
You know yield THE PVE META!
---
i remember the first time i ever completed this strike it happened to me lmfao
---
i was expecting a second phase
---
I'm a titan main and have been since d1. Warlock is by far the most superior class in the game. Titans were only good in pvp for apeing with macro. But because they nerfed that titans have nothing really going for them. Dawnblade is the best pvp super in the game. One eyed mask is the only thing in pvp keeping the titans alive.
---
You killed him with his own shit!
---
Glad to see you have been enjoying the game! Cant wait till shadowkeep comes out!
---
ITs "Competitive". Its not supposed to be something that anyone can win. If you have won 4 games out of 100, I am sorry but I don't think that you will be able to do it by yourself.
---
Your only options are to ask 3 others to be on your team to help "Carry" you to 2100, or to find a friend (or pay a website) to recover your account and do it for you.
---
I had a friend recover my account since I knew I couldn't do it myself and he was happy to get 2100 for me.

Hot water is usually used when you have tea bags.

Can someone explain the “pulses are a dads weapon” joke to me? I just don’t get it
---
Wow!
---
Yes, the quests are available from the drifter!
---
Thank you for having that common sense. Some people don't think to do that and ruin actual forge runs for people.

I've been having the same problem. I dropped sub-200, but after about 20-30 forges, I realize I've been kicked..

SOMEONE BETTER SHOOT THOSE HANDS

Thank you

“new farming method” I mean, it’s from 2 seasons ago, hardly new.
---
Lol agreed no
---
This would look great on a T-shirt!
---
I'm guessing, it's match game, blackout, and void or solar singe with extinguish
---
get bounties from drifter to get synths of the armor type you want, play reckoning and upgrade your syhthesizer
---
My brain hurts ....
---
Thanks man. It’s a question that’s been hanging in my head for a while now.
---
*clears throat* WHAT'RE THOSE‽‽‽
---
because I am the absolute worst in crucible but I have to play crucible for quests and bounties. I only play crucible the bare minimum

I’d say he phrased it a little rudely, but after you get shot by it once, it’s pretty easy to dodge, because you’re expecting it.  It makes a pretty easy to pick out noise as it charges, and lateral movement is better than their tracking.  Strafe to the side while facing the Jotuun, and it’ll miss every time.  Don’t try to jump over them, your taller hitbox is easy to hit by it’s tracking horizontally.
---
It’s really not used on console, at least in comp, it’ll be dodged 90% of the time, a good range roll on a Erental (that’s probably spelled wrong) or Main Ingredient will do better there.  It’s super prevalent in Iron Banner regardless though, because you can be 200 light below someone and still 1-hit them with a direct hit. 
---
Don’t get me wrong, I love Jotuun, and it absolutely wrecks against people who don’t strafe or know how to dodge it. I was just saying that it’s a lot easier to dodge than you’re making it out to be.  I’d prefer the gun if it didn’t track, would making threading the needle and not hitting every wall near every target easier.
---
Yeah, I’m never leaving my house once it’s out
---
Seriously though great job my dude, looks great!
---
Thats it you’re done that’s your exotic allowance for the year!
---
I'm not a PvE guy, so I don't remember.
---
Thanks! Personally, I like using it with a sunshot as my primary and an avalanche as my power, seeing as free to play guardians don’t really get that many good weapons in their arsenal, especially on PC where only a select few hand cannons are viable.
---
“Money Crolo” sounds like the name of a Soundcloud rapper.
---
It comes out in the middle of semester for me so some lectures may be missed due to it coming out if they are optional.
---
Me too, I thought the gun was coming out with shadowkeep...
---
Nano machines son
---
Nice

You are so lucky. You should get the eggs and the bones. it will be so easy for you to get them. Just make sure every week you get the bones and eggs and in the shattered throne. Have friends to help you. It took me so long to get it because I had to solo 95 percent of it. The 5 percent was the raid last wish I needed help since there was no way to solo the boss.
---
I like to kill them in the cheapest way possible. Then bagging them hard core.
---
Aw man, ill be at a con this weekend. WHY IS EVERYTHING HAPPENING THIS WEEK!?
---
There are a large number of Dreaming City guides floating around. [Here is one that I used.](https://www.shacknews.com/article/101225/destiny-2-complete-strategy-guide#d2-dreaming-city)

This is a very common bug that a lot of people have been experiencing on all 3 platforms since the last patch.
---
Prometheus Lens. Laser tag trials weekend was rough.
---
Cooooool
---
This is an AMAZING drawing, keep up the good work!
---
How???
---
"be gentle" is probably what whoever is on the recieving end of that says
---
As someone with this title. The Journey was rough, but i would do it all over again.
---
The only people who keep bringing this up -- going on 5 years now since VoG -- don't understand the vital communication element of raids. They think they're basically 6-man strikes.
---
Yeah that’s the one. And yeah, yeah it really was
---
Do you want it to have zero rockets?
---
If you want lore r/DestinyLore and if you want to talk secrets r/raidsecrets
---
The most OP hairdryer ever.
---
Like your progress or the game?
---
Yes. My campaign progress, items, characters, etc.
---
If you don’t want to lose points you can just wait for iron banner tomorrow
---
Yes it'll all transfer
---
Google Translate te ha fallado.
---
Alright Cool!!! Thanks I was nervous there for a second.
---
Aaaaah, I watched a video about it. I'm sure it was Houndish but I'm not positive.
---
Use a 180 fs -- ikelos, nature of the beast, cold sweat, service revolver, trust, malfeasance, etc. If none of those, try luna, NF,  or rose. 
---
The Rose is the sleeper here, imo. So good.
---
Depends on what you're asking for. If it's your progress/rank on games like Destiny or Diablo then it is saved to your account and will sync. If you mean the local files for the game, then no, it will have to reinstall the game.
---
Technically you could transfer the data over yourself, and if you re-use the same drive from the old computer on the new one it would already be there. Depends on what exactly you're doing.
---
Is that the official?
---
Just need the EP helm for Wayfarer myself. Glad RNGesus finally came through for ya.
---
This happen to me recently after reformatting my hard drive. Put the cursor over D2 press the menu button&gt;Manage game &amp; add ons&gt;Ready to install see if any D2 content is available to download. If not go the the see in Microsoft store option and scroll to Forsaken and see if you can download it from there.
---
Huumm...
---
Blast. 
---
I really dunno beyond that check. I’ve had it happen with Division where I had to manually go in and download the DLC that way, and was hoping it was the same fix.
---
It is indeed! 😀
---
Lol it’s bottom tree on nightstalker. Not a bug
---
Orpheus rig.

Thing naturally shoots six without the exotic.  I think you can get like 10 off before your super is out.
---

---
Tank: I'm about to end this man whole carrer
---
Oof, thanks. I knew six was normal, that’s why I was confused.
---
Wait, for real? The piece from the weekly bounty rotates? I guess I only noticed it when it's been the helm. Fml lol.
---
