Good luck buddy

Nice

If you use the new shell and remote from shadowkeep preorder (deluxe edition I think?) You can have a eris' rock shell and a eris' rock emote.
---
When there's one left I go into Jason Voorhees mode. I will either get my sword or walk towards them ready to smack him to death. No sprinting... Just a slow walk... They try to shoot me with their pea shooters, but I keep walking. Closer and closer. They try to melee me, I just stand there and take it... Let him run some more. It's like a game of cat and mouse. And then...I end him. 
---

---
Man this sounded a lot cooler in my head. Now I just sound like a psychopath.
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat for PvP and just aim for fun rather than being super competitive in QuickPlay.
---
Interesting but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôd use the ghost shell as the rock placeholder even if it was equipped
---
Just beautiful

No,it ends on the 27th the extension was simply for moments of triumph not the solstice event.

It's cuz warlock jumps are shit (Warlock and Hunter player here). Somehow, the least useful PvE class (Titan, sry) has the best float jumps.
---
Same here, except its the only one im doing )

What are you, some kind of hunter-hating Attunement of Flame or Code of the Juggernaut OEM meta piece of crap? Hunters aren‚Äôt the problem.

Don't know where else to ask, new to Reddit. Does anyone know if you can entered Shattered Throne this week? I am trying to complete my Solstice masterwork objectives and the portal is not open. Are there any prerequisites to enter? Any help is greatly appreciated.

 Moments of Triumph was extended, not Solstice.
---
Thanks bud
---
That would piss me right tf off, my suggestion would be reinstall, but wait n see if anyone else has somthing more direct
---
Thanks, I won‚Äôt
---
Riskrunner is most definitely one of the most underrated exotics for pve activities. My personal favorite use is in the Zero Hour mission because of all the fallen that shoot arc. If you have 3 people running it the entire mission is a breeze.

Yeah I was wondering this as well.

Without a doubt lol. I definetely wanna sit and grind hard for that as well. I know it's a monster.

1. Yes I used to play console. I started PC gaming earlier this year, so yes I did buy Destiny on PC before cross save came.
---
2. Both monitors are hooked up to my GPU, it does drop your FPS a little, but I have a high end GPU so I don‚Äôt lose much at all. I probably wouldn‚Äôt use 2 monitors with a low end GPU.
---
It might be on a list of stuff to add, but they have more important stuff to add and fix first, I imagine.

You can view major objectives on the left side of the director. It doesn't really matter too much what order you do stuff in. Just pick whichever thing seems fun.

Watch how quickly Bungie get spammed by complaints and we lose it lol

Just started my Gambit games. I forgot how unfun it is and I love Cruicible lol

~~or it‚Äôll be from vex invasions~~
---
To use an item, you equip it. Open the character menu and click on an item to equip it. You should  be able to figure this out, but once you have a weapon equipped, you swap to it (on PC this is the scroll wheel or 1, 2, and 3 keys) and then you use the mouse buttons to attack.

Hey! Great news! No problem!

That‚Äôs gonna be me!.. as soon I figure out how to build a pc lol

I‚Äôd highly recommend grinding for a well rolled Beloved, it‚Äôd complete the combo. For some reason Beloved feels leagues better than other snipers in the game. Find a snapshot/quickdraw roll on that bad boy and you‚Äôll be golden.

Apples to oranges; the ONLY thing to spend money on in fortnite battle royale is mtx. Of course there are people that spend money on fortnite, and of course they get mtx for the money spent.
---
Destiny 2, however, has a considerably more manipulative and outright moneygrubbing monetization system. Lets ignore, for just a moment, the dumpster fire that was Y1 (where literally even the most casual player was max light after like 2 weeks with nothing else to farm for except content that was gated behind the eververse.) even if the game had a sustainable gameplay loop, endgame grinds etc, the amount of content recieved for the amount of money paid (250$ after shadowfall/next annual pass i think is what were at now?) is still VERY onesided compared to literally EVERY SINGLE OTHER AAA GAME ON THE MARKET
---
For something like truth? Definitely, you are correct, for a potato launcher like jotun? 15 cintemeters is more than enough. The tracking on jotun is ass, and not the good kind
---
Translucent doesn't even mean invisible. It means semi transparent!
---
And no gamepad in sight, looks promising !

Doesn't niris have a Reddit?
---
Got eeeeeeeeem!
---
You're right tho.
---
Aug 27th.
---
The patrols grind suuuuucked. I literally stopped playing destiny and folded laundry instead because it‚Äôs a chore that‚Äôs less boring and more useful. Maybe that was their intent?
---
I see people doing really good with it. It's a solid gun
---
Ohhh I get it now, after 0.2 seconds of seeing your comments I realize you're an Xbox fanboy. Makes sense. Functional intelligent people aren't Dumb enough to buy those
---
listen man, it's fuze, fuze transcends siege almost as much as our lord.
---
Monitor.. too far... away....
---
So I switched to PC halfway through Black Armory so I‚Äôm a little behind on my power level. Should I try to cross-save now or wait until New Light comes out and cross save then, or will it not matter and whichever one I pick I‚Äôll still be behind?
---
CHAOS REACH, the last dreg a foot away.
---
I platinumed It before any dlc came out. If you wanna do it know so you have to get all trophy‚Äôs or just the ones for the base game?
---
Exactly! And with the catalyst it functions as well as just about any high tier crucible weapon
---
You be having a bruh moment if you think I‚Äôm taking any of this seriously. I‚Äôm straight up having fun
---
ü§•
---
Works really good with Chaperone and also Le Monarque
---
Are you on PC or console? Cuz the metas are WAY different on each platform
---
That's the signature of a One Eyes Mask/Lord of Wolves Juggernaut Titan who teabagged too much.
---
This is just stupid now
---
Oh no save my karma waaaah, that's u
---
If you have forsaken, I would recommend doing the campaign if you haven't started it and work on your light level
---
&gt; Inb4 people claim that playing from launch puts you further ahead of other people getting in with Destiny: New Light. Protip: it doesn't. You dont even get exclusive seasonal rewards for playing since season 1.
---
I mean, the New Light players wont have any exotics or things like recluse n' shit.
---
The base game simply doesnt offer that much compared to recent DLCs
---
Sorry. That should have been obvious on my part. Console
---
"....SO?!"
---
I get it now. It‚Äôs hard to tell if people r joking online or not.
---
I used to rock crimson. Might pick that up again.
---
SO ITS NOT JUST ME
---
It's because I have a max range Retold Tale from the first week of Forsaken, lol.
---
I have like the same exact binds
---
Like me but I'm grinding out atleast one solsrice set. I try for PvP weps before Shadowkeep though.
---
5 inches 11 feet and 6 inches 0 feet?
---
True :)
---
Is that the Bufo toad? Ya know, 5-MeO-DMT toad.
---
Shoudl I buy foresaken now then shadowkeep when it come out or just wait?
---
Riskrunner is the biggest "fuck you" to the enemies in that forge - and a well deserved "fuck you."
---
Just swap to weapons that drop from gambit in all three slots like 2 mins before you win shit like bygones/trust/crooked fang. That's what I did
---
Totally agree. Lol
---
That was part of the document you agreed to before you accepted cross link. It said in the third point. Hope they decide to help you.
---
I'm an idiot and didnt read it. I got too excited lol
---
Oh no
---
* smashes through your living room wall* OH YEAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH
---
Yeah....most of those people STILL refuse to play the game because ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no reason to‚Äù ‚Äúthat game is dead lol‚Äù
---
Yes I actually know people who have said that.
---
i am done with all eaz parts of the blue armor, will i have enough time to do it all, and how many hours should i guess
---
What if wish 15....IS D1!
---
Oh yes
---
Why? They're easy af to get.
---
Can you still go back and forth between console and PC fluidly? Or are those characters now just on PC?
---
Wanted to jump in and say thanks to everyone who offered advice.  Helped my team crack 200k!
---
Most people will continue to think that because paying 250$ for a AAA Game is ludicrous, especially when half the content (that shouldve been in the base game) is now free.
---
I understood that reference
---
Sunbreaker- CoD--&gt; hammer kills= fastest way solo, unless Fireteam with same class then shit through a horn mode.
---
Pretty sure it drops le monarque, actually
---
Got mine on my 6th run, sadly it‚Äôs not very good compared to recluse
---
here from the menagerie post
---
It looks like it "transfered" to steam, but I would assume once Shadowkeep drops I would have to buy it on Xbox to play there.
---
You didn't lose your character right?
---
Ik know! It's a gamechanger when you run shattered throne solo!
---
No I'm just on a that restriction for 89 days
---
Damn guess you gotta wait for a fix. Hope it all goes well!
---
You just r/phalanxed Him nice
---
The 50 bounties is my biggest problem
---
It‚Äôs tested that you have more DPS just emptying your ammo without meeleing every 3rd shot. You can get even more DPS with a boss spec mod that you can equip, something Ikelos can‚Äôt do that any rapid fire archetype can do, Forsaken DLC and newer. It‚Äôs not really worth running it.
---
About 15 hours to complete a full set from drained to Majestic. Focus on maximizing your time by looking at all of your armor pieces and try to group things that can be done simultaneously. Aslo while doing your drained set start doing bounties and holding on to them because you'll need 50 once you get to the renewed set.
---
It is indeed photoshopped, mb, although meleeing a bottom tree striker would‚Äôve been fun
---
Wait, did you think the d1 stuff would merge over or are you talking about d2 stuff on ps4 merging over? If it's the prior, then the comment above has a point. Lol. If it's the latter, I was bummed too since I grinded alot pre forsaken and switched to PC at forsaken, but I still think cross save is pretty cool.
---
It‚Äôs 38k bright dust not 3k
---
50 did not do it for me, maybe 75 is my lucky number!
---
I'm a pc player so idk other than 180 rpm hand cannons
---
*marked for vengeance*
---
Nope I‚Äôm not on pc
---
I saw someone use fighting lion and it had about 32000 kills I believe
---
Dlc doesn't carry over across platforms
---
Tat wizawd came fwom te moon
---
I mean the vast majority of content in d2 and d1 for that matter is outside of the crucible. If you wanna play a pvp focused bungie game I'm pretty sure halo 3 servers are still up üòÇ
---
*Proceeds to drive head on into oncoming traffic*
---
This happened to me too, but don‚Äôt worry, if you chose your good account as active that is the one you will get, it will only display blizzard accounts on one of the websites and it causes some confusion, whereas another page on the cross-save website shows the one you actually chose.
---
Snipers require skill nothing else you said requires a nervous system
---
Haha I went on a 1300 glory loss streak and about died
---
Whichever you feel looks best. It's an aesthetic item, so personal choice. :)
---
Eva Levante - Martha Stewart
---
What that has to do with anything? I am not playing only crucible, I am not looking for only pvp focused bungie game. just saying that part is properly broken.
---
57 completions... no Anarchy. Still a dazzle in my guardian‚Äôs eyes.
---
It's always hilarious to obliterate a golden gunner who doesn't know where to pop their super lol, a guy popped it once in the middle of nowhere and I clicked his head while he was still pointing at the sky
---
jayz2cents, gamers nexus and linus tech tips are great resources for help with pc components. Also r/pcmasterrace
---
 I'm offering solutions to your problem. But if you'd prefer to just whine about it that's fine too ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è whether or not you wanna nut up and git gud isn't my problem
---
I mean I want to use void but I accidentally leveled up arc.
---
Hey dude! I've had this suggestion and been touring it for a while now, it might make your case a little stronger as rather than just doing away with something, you're offering up an alternative. What if every longer quest had PvP and PvE optional steps you could mix and match?
---
For example, where Luna's Howl might ask for 100 Guardian headshots in Competitive, there would be a separate progress bar for say 250 yellow bar enemies killed with precision damage in playlist Strikes.
---
Originally I thought of this to help people that struggle with PvP and end up paying for carries, which I despise and think contributes to worse Crucible experience overall, but it might actually help out in your case too? IDK, what do you think?
---
I didn't even start it. Same thing last year, my heart just wasn't in it. I tried it last year and only made it to Tier 2 (I had the "deadline" wrong so I grinded thru it in like a day). This year, I just don't have the fight left in me lmao.
---
Anarchy will be the last exotic I need, if only I had good rng with scourge..
---
This is where I think the confusion is. PC players and console will never be able to compete against each other.
---
Contact support
---
I'm halfway now, I've completed my warlock and am on the blue on my titan, then I just have to complete blue and all of my hunter before reset

Missed opportunity on calling it Little Light.

You need to buy the glows

Not fun when you are the receiving side

Where is the image from, or is it a stand alone image?
---
So kinda like Baar Dau.
---
The day Zavala dies we'll all be toast.
---
I still don't have one. Fingers crossed Xur happens to have it tomorrow!
---
I don't believe warlocks consume super anymore at least not on pc when using the handheld nova, but there is a point I'd like to present about hunters.
---
They might not have a  OHK variant action, but they do have other powerful assets like the smoke grenade which slows and disorient it's victim and with spectral blades they can have wall-hacks after precision kills while crouched.
---
Oh boy, not to be a dick but your best choice would be youtube man
---
Your first mistake was buying a gimmicky dumpster fire.
---
Big golfball
---
Thanks I'll get on that!
---
TLW's intrinsic perk rewards hip-firing.
---
Core Playerbase would cry as they shoulder charge/ohk with their lock nade
---
What bungie should do is make it ohk if in certain radius. Like hand held nova radius. If it was ohk with no limits, people would be getting dropped from afar.
---
I am working on my third toon now (Hunter). Thinking of blue requirements makes me sad.
---
You will need to repurchase
---
Is it weird that I actually like the look of this
---
Ok? I know.. if you‚Äôre on pc it‚Äôs a waste to hip fire since the stability is so high..
---
You use kb&amp;m
---
I wish Bungie would rework this weapon to be an actual heavy machine gun. As an auto rifle it isn't competitive. It's just too slow
---
I mean you certainly still should ADS with TLW but hip-firing is also pretty neat on it.
---
We left after Osiris was released, came back a month ago and we're enjoying the the a lot.
---
There‚Äôs a bubble inside your computer
---
I'm getting triggered looking at this
---
Handheld supernova is a grenade not a melee and only available to middle tree void warlock. Also, kind of skeptical, why would a knife to the face kill a guardian when a large hand cannon bullet or a burst of rifle ammo doesn't.
---
What else is new ?
---
Hive tOwOmbships, cutting thwough!
---
I just do it cuz why not it's sort of a tradition now isn't it
---
Dont use a controller on pc and use a keyboard and mouse. Simple fix.
---
That first clip tho. It's reminding me of all the Blade Barrages wasted on supers because they just don't register. That or blinking fucks me over.
---
Oddly enough, the gambit part went by the easiest for me, although I think I only got lucky cause I didn't run into any 4 stacks.
---
Me Titan, must punch
---
Where is your title?
---
Dul incaru solo it destroys
---
Always watch houndishes video for the reset. He not only shows you where it is but he takes you through it
---
Instagram bad gib platinum or u normie.
---
This is payback for how hard us warlocks get thrown around by everything.
---
Wait a minute.. I don't need to shoot that? I've been bamboozled this entire time.
---
Because these are cosmetics. They are not a must. If it is a must for you then you have to pay up. Not everything is free.
---
when New light comes out are we still required to have a Playstation Plus to play online?
---
Ha. Typical!
---
Questioning my iq right now
---
I know I haven't touched it in 2 months since the lag got super annoying in Save The World......which was a problem back in October when I first started playing it.
---
Didn‚Äôt Sport Chalet close down or something?
---
Yeah i can imagine but ive just seen it more often on Mars
---
Aint nobody does finishers like Doom did... So far they look quite repetitive in D2

---
Cammy has over 230k as of his most recent video. It‚Äôs ridiculous.
---
Congratulations, you are now part of the institution of shooting people from very far away
---
somebody tell fallout that we found another long barrel boy
---
I left warframe to play D2, you can tell how sceptic i was about it
---
I havent played WF in a year now...
---
Wait, does it have even more steps to complete once it's people armor?
---
If so, I'm done haha.
---
That's why i said "Dooms little brother." nothing major, but easing closer
---
Okay! Hope to play with you soon
---
 I did this raid for the first time last week, and our raid leader did the exact same thing!
---
It's one of the strongest weapons in the game just like bot. striker is one of the strongest super. Idk what's so hard to understand about that. I just trash talked him back a bit.

DLC transfers for free from Bungie/battlenet to steam.  but for cross save with consoles you must buy the DLC on each console and/or PC.

next week.

How about you lose 15 percent on a mod nobody you ever use it in the state you propose
---
 "**And that ladies and gentlemen is how you defeat a bad striker titan"**
---
Fixed the title for you.
---
Your talking about the bow Wish Ender. 
---
You should also realize that during Solstice, at any time, Guardians can pick up void elemental charges that allows them to see through walls. 
---
You should also note, there is a class in the game called Hunter. One of its subclasses allows truesight on precision kills.
---
About 7-8 days. I really like LMG's. So i should focus on that i suppose?
---
Oh.  I see.  I suppose I'll just finish up the Gambit frame for Ada and then pick Vanguard, then.
---
I still keep the lucky rabbit's paw you get from those chests
---
By lmg do you mean the heavy or simple auto rifles?
---
oh i didnt know. we learn every day right.
---
i wear the "Memory of Cayde" class item on all 3 of my characters at all times to honor him.
---
My luck manifests in real dumb ways. Wish I could get some actual m ok ney for a change.
---
I kept 4 scout reports and Queen of Hearts is my always ship. I always keep that special avatar of Cayde on my psn
---
that‚Äôs a **CHUNKY** boy
---
Gotcha.  Vanguard it is, then, I suppose.  Thanks for your help!
---
I‚Äôve still got 12 scout reports from year 1.
---
How do you like you primevil cooked sir?
---
Somebody get this guy some cheese to go with his whine.
---
Thanks. Might have inflated the number in my head. Wow, 50 kills down, only 25 to go then :P
---
"Only" XD
---
Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
---
FIGHT FOREVER GAURDIAN
---
What if Cayde is.. *looks around* ... in there?
---

I revoked your red Arrow because of the fornite dance

My friends will agree, I've become really annoying based off of the amount of times I've said "holy shit I can't wait for shadowkeep"
---
Anyone on pc wanna team up, just transferee from console so i don‚Äôt have anyone
---
mod?
---
Prestige is a nightfall with a score over 100K utilizing the modifier card. I believe for the masterwork armor you need a 200K score.
---
Check how much space is left on the hard drive that has destiny, this hapend to me after the latest update when i moved dedteny to a hard drive with more extra space it stoped.
---
Hey, I just did a bunch of doubles and got them in like 3.5 hours
---
That's fair
---
Ah ok, I thought I had to get 200k plus do something snazzy
---
Typo
---
decays maybe, would be right if it just flatout poofed afyer a short amount of time.
---
Okay thanks.
---
ah.
---
okay i gotcha. thanks for the info. i was really just referring to how they practiced. earned that skill. they didnt give up, and now they are here. i just wanna justify my point being skill is a factor, and to earn that amount of skill of cammy and baken is not easy, but doable, proven by them themselves. I am not the tiniest bit good, i have to use a lot of my best pvp items to even do good but i do practice. and practice is what matters when it comes to skills
---
idk, getting one shot kills with a short zoom scope seems pretty easy
---
That did the trick! Colors are back to normal. Thanks!  
---
(HDR now turned off)
---
By the way; I think I'm still having some input lag, even when fullscreen. Any thoughts as to why that is?  
---
Started after I got win10.
---
Mine is on nessus. Still got all of his odds and ends. Also all his letters to Ace and Ace of Spades.
---
I read the title, and I already knew it'd be a clip of the Arms Dealer strike.
---
She's got a body like an hourglass, and it's ticking like a clock?
---
Heavy.
---
This happened at launch
---
A lot of people are doing gambit prime matches for their solstice armor and don't care at all if they win. Stuff like this should always be objectively oriented so people are not mailing it in.
---
Sword logic on the field
---
Same. Took a similar picture.
---
What am I seeing?
---
I am doing only one and I am feeling the grind
---
ps4 :(
---
Squeaky clean
---
Same here! I held on to one last chest purposely for sentimental reasons.
---
Really? Its the shoulders that annoy me, I like the helmet!

When does cayde die? I beat the main campaign and the first 2 dlc campaigns and don't remember him dying
---
My apologies! I was looking for the rules and regulations about video postings but I couldn‚Äôt find. For future reference can I please have a link so I don‚Äôt post another rule violation. Haha thanks man, I shocked myself quite a bit too.

Thank you for the info! Didn‚Äôt realize it was a daily reset lol (read somewhere about it being weekly... that or I misread) been sitting here waiting for weeks like an idiot. Glad to hear they‚Äôre adding that system in, bf &amp; I are left with one weapon and been frustrated with our rng lol.
---
You can tell if Shattered Throne is up by looking at the top right corner of the infographic. It's not up, but you can masterwork the armor after the event ends.
---
Exactly, think about 'The Man They Called Cayde' Book, and how he talks about his Queen and Ace. They are a part of his memory, his mind, his very being. While he isn't sure and doesn't care if they are just some implanted memory - having them as a motivation made him a better person. Pushed him to be the Man we knew, respected, and loved.
---
Burn them. Let Cayde live in your memory. Let him be the memory that pushes you to be the best damn guardian you can be.
---
It looks like the super scope for NES
---
Yeah that was the worst part when I finished up my Warlock. I broke it off into ‚Äúchunks‚Äù of 3/3/2/2 Games and did those damn Titan Patrols and EAZ stuff in between to break it up. I did get Delirum and Hush in the process though!
---
Youre still gonna have to buy everything again, it doesnt transfer purchase info just characters
---
Me and Crucible right now
---
I got that gun without realising so
---
Call up an ep, wait for hive to spawn, get a single headshot with gravaton lance, watch the fireworks and helium filled bodies
---
Yeah it's full pvp free for all. Remember you don't have to win. Just get headshots.  And it's oddly fun to just run around because everyone is watching everyone at all times so you can catch people off guard pretty easy.

The  best advice for motes is to basically always go for small blockers unless there is no chance of an invasion happening soon. 
---
Like the farming equipment above told you, the team wipes will happen on their own, you just have to get 25 kills worth from invasions on your own which really won't take long considering all of the advantages you get as an invader. 
---
I recommend working on breakneck and 21% delirium at the same time. By the time you hit 40 games played for breakneck, you should have malfeasance complete, or you'll be very close. You also shouldn't be too terribly far from the reset for 21% delirium by that point either.
---
Is this confirmed ? do you have a link to this info ?
---
There‚Äôs a dumb ‚Äòbloom‚Äô learning curve to them but once you get over that they‚Äôre pretty manageable. Idk how much enhanced HC targeting does because I don‚Äôt have it but I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôll help with the stickiness as general feel. TLW is a while ‚Äònother thing though. Kicks like no tmrw. I find that pacing your shots and not just laying on the trigger helps. Hip accuracy on the thing is tremendous so as long as you can follow the enemy you should be good. And with TLW 4-tap to the body on console is pretty competitive.
---
5 super mods boyo
---
I use truth as an invader deterrent too. If I invader, which I usually only do if it's for a quest or no one on my team will, I use my sniper. Just easier that way.

What I did with my second character was do Gambit Prime. I still needed solar kills so I would just kill enemies while camping near the invasion portal. Soon as I could invade I would with my handy Oxygen SR3 and Thousand Voices. Ended up getting like 50/75 kills that way .

I was thinking of getting on the beloved hype train too. I was wondering for the masterwork whether I should go for stability or range. Wouldn‚Äôt need handling thanks to snapshot, and more range means more aim assist or better accuracy. I‚Äôm not sure which or if it‚Äôs both but range seems to be my favoured option.
---
nice
---
If you're really hesitant I'd say wait for new light on October 1st. There's some pretty hefty changes coming with the fall update.
---
But if you're really interested, forsaken and all the year 2 expansions is a steal right now.
---
Depending on what day it is, if you have played 3 comp games in the week u can just wait for tuesday reset.
---
Cross-save + LB+RB
---
I know this isn‚Äôt the answer you wanna hear but I really think anyone can complete kalli. Make an lfg post outlining what you want done and I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll find ppl to help you out, just make sure you watch guides online so you can carry your own weight. Good luck guardian!
---
Forsaken dlc.üëç
---
Next week is a high curse week.  Complete the Oracle and give the offering. You should get the seed from that chest.    It is also a guaranteed drop from Last Wish Raid.
---
How? Pray they suck?
---
I got on one day to farm Jotuun after already doing my warlock set and then I thought ‚Äúwhy would I farm this gun when I can already have 3 entire sets of armor 2.0‚Äù
---
The map itself is a nice change imo, i think if the activity for it was different it would be awesome. Too much stress with the timer but a crucible match with snipers all over the place in it would be cool
---
I feel you. The only thing i want from this season's engram. Yet shaders are one my luck streak.
---
Best bet is to LFG it on one of the many LFG apps/treads.  If you put the request out there that you are a noob looking for a crew to guide you, you should get a response.  There are loads of folks willing to help.
---
Same here! I've only got 9 rounds down out of the 40 for Breakneck.
---
This grind is gonna suck baaallls, but I want that rifle (and maybe get some better Bygones rolls out of the time spent as well).
---
you mean how damn near every single path is a deadend  :D
---
Hey
---
I've been refreshing this thread for the past week and I think I finally found a good fit!  
---
I've been going back to D2 for a week now, trying to complete some quest and get some exotic before shadowfall (the grind for the soltice armor made my head spin lol)  
---
My favorite activity would be Gambit, and I really hate people who takes the game too seriously and then get mad. We're all here to have fun no?
---
I'll send a request on bungie that net, my psn is LuffySeiei00.
---
Send me the discord link when you can!
---
PC. It's mostly because I'm a dude in my 30s and don't have time for raids and stuff like that. I play like maybe 2-3h a day max, if even that. Proud I at least got the legendary armor on my Titan and Hunter though.
---
The key is to be the invader and control the match. That's the only way I can enjoy a Gambit match. 2 more Army of One medals to break 100 lol.
---
*the sacred texts!*
---
You‚Äôre right! I forgot about the high curse + offering.
---
What you act like this isn‚Äôt normal
---
Id definitely pick up forsaken and the annual pass, it's a steal right now. There's a lot of meta weapons and such in year 2 you'll want to get your hands on, the new subclasses are (mostly) great, and the forsaken/dreaming city stuff are going to be really important to the lore and the story if that's something you care about.
---
Hope to see you star side Guardian!
---
I got my rampage spec first go-round with ada-1. Not to flex though.
---
DON'T CROSS THE STREAMS!!!!
---
I see no lies here
---
Thanks for the suggestion. Im not opposed to raids; I just am a solo player. I would like a go at Last Wish, so i shall look into the raid soon. Thank you.
---
i had the error at the "lets do it" button, but i fixed it by going into a incognito tab and doing the same process. Not sure how it fixed it but it worked.
---
Hold up, we have to purchase the DLCS AGAIN on each system? That is insane, then what's the point of going Cross-Save if you are only going to make people have to pay for each console than just unlocking the expansion PER account rather than per system.
---
Can i have some of that rng
---
Exactly, it's kinda sad that there's Legendaries that get pretty close to the Sunshot's DPS and function. Improve the Sunshot Bungo!
---
Mmmmmmaaaaaaannnnnn, I remember the ride of iron one, still have it somewhere, and the poster too
---
Tier 3 and heroic is always fun, so i will continue. Plus, BW helps with class triumph completions! (Yep, i care about triumph score lol) Thanks for the feedback.
---
I have yet to see what Last Wish is about, so i have added it to my list. Thanks!
---
Cayde wouldn‚Äôt want an unopened box to be his legacy 
---
His legacy should be the ace of spades and whoever took his vanguard dare. Every shot ace fires is cayde‚Äôs legacy not some unopened box on titan
---
I only use the Discord Destiny LFG server. It makes it easy to find a group to play with because there are literally hundreds of people on at any given time, and it's not hit or miss like the LFG app
---
Not gonna lie I'm the invader with izanagis, recluse, hammerhead, and 6 shot goldie. Works like a charm but sometimes I feel bad
---
Just buy the collection. Its the same price forsaken was when it launched and it comes with everything all the way to current content.
---
I'm not 100% sure on that, I don't play on PC. But on PS4/Xbox Forsaken + the year 2 annual pass (season of the forge, season of the drifter, and season of oppulance) is going for $40.
---
I got supered four times by a bottom tree striker they won the match after he stayed in his super spawn trapping my team.
---
That's a weird looking hammerhead you got there
---
I‚Äôm interested in this too, I pre-ordered Shadowkeep as a returning year one player. I‚Äôve completed Osiris and Warmind but now I‚Äôm a little stuck.. I think I have to wait until Shadowkeep to progress.
---
It doesn‚Äôt seem worth buying forsaken for a months playtime and everything becoming redundant? I suppose I‚Äôm missing out on exotics and current raid experience though.
---
yeah those
---
Hahaha no, but now that you mention it. I'm so happy I didnt choose my warlock as the 2nd one to get the armor. I'm so sorry, you poor poor soul
---
Cursebreaker is definitely one of the coolest sounding titles.
---
Amount of stupid in this post is off the charts
---
It lets you wear a second exotic.
---
Well, doom eternal isn't out yet soooooo
---
Curse of Osiris &amp; Warmind are already free
---
Youbonly need to buy Forsaken and Annual Pass (Year 2 pass) best deal is the Collection which has everything but since base game and two DLC's are gonna be free you'll only buy it for Forsaken
---
If you peorder Shadowkeep, you'll get Shadowkeep (obviously) and first season (Season of the undying) if you want more seasons preorder digidal deluxe or buy them seperately later
---
Yep you can watch a simple guide for just her and find a team specifically for that reason. Maybe stop on by the Sherpa subreddit they could help you outright with no prior knowledge.
---
Literally how I feel rn
---
Oh, so basically it‚Äôs a legendary arm piece with an extra shitty perk that you can‚Äôt Transmat, although it looks pretty good
---
:*-(
---
Personally I think that overall damage should be increased by a % for each stack of Megenaura.
---
Me with 15 motes seeing the invader: *sprays teeth with chrome paint* I am needed in Valhalla!
---
I have one chest, one of each item that dropped and some scouting reports left in the vault. Wow typing it out makes it sound much more obsessive than it really is.
---
*Looks at void grenade*   
---
OwO what's this?
---
So I have until August 28 to get it to legendary?
---
I know how you feel. It's like everyone forgets how to play Crucible when they're in Gambit. When I hear "Invader on the field!" I stop what I'm doing and start hunting.
---
Just another reason warlocks are oppressed in our society
---
ok yes, i‚Äôm halfway through my 2nd blue armor set for solstice and it‚Äôs such a dragggg my god i don‚Äôt know if i can get myself to finish my titan‚Äôs blue armor before reset
---
Wow. My fucking heart.
---
I see these kinds of arguments all the time and they make no sense to me. Sure, there are plenty of things in this game that are incredibly easy and powerful to use. But it‚Äôs not like a bad player using the OP thing will be just as effective as a good player using the same weapon/super/whatever. For example, I‚Äôm much more terrified of CammyCakes running around with OEM than I am JoSchmo with a 0.69 K/D running around with OEM.
---
Every time I see the traveller it just reminds me about how bad I want a raid where you go inside it
---
I decided one day that I was going to get my "Four the Hard Way" Triumph. I figured it was going to be a little tough since I can't snipe worth a damn so I went at it with Huckleberry, because I'm also a masochist. I mean, I do play Comp after all so obviously there's something wrong with me.
---
Anyhow I decided to keep track of how many invasions it took as I was headed toward the portal I put a little hash mark on my notebook for the first one. Turns out only one guy on the other team was actually at his keyboard and the other ones were AFK botting. Got it on my first try and then hogged the portal the rest of the match so I could go dance and chill with my new buddy on the other side.
---
Seriously, something needs to be done about AFK players in match made activities.
---
Yes.
---
Worked in Microsoft Edge. Not a joke. I couldn't remember my steam info either so once it got to the steam log in page I copied the URL back into chrome to finish logging in. I went back to the PC Move page and it said my account was linked.
---
I think so, I saw some in r/blursedimages and had to try it myself
---
Alright. Thank you
---
If you have a lot of eververse bounty notes you can just keep buying them
---
Each planetary vendor gives you 3 bounties, and vanguard/crucible give you 5 bounties. Spider also has a bunch of bounties you can do, so I would say it's possible to knock out 30+ in a day.
---
That made me smile
---
I still have one left myself plus a treasure mape for each of the planets
---
Agreed, its getting a bit ridiculous
---
Man open it. Hell be back as Cayde 7.
---
Happens to me every time
---
Giving him a taste of his own medicine!
---
They wipe exo's. Like Werner.
---
Congratz man!
---
Search bar.
---
When you kill cayde's killer but then he's revived by a ghost
---
Fight fire with fire but without the fire
---
You can, 3 bounties per planet, spider has something like 7-8 himself. Tess has about the same iirc 7-8. 5 vanguard, 5 crucible. Shit ton from gambit dude, ada-1 for forge bounties thats 7 more. And the eververse bounties can be repeated.
---
I hope this is a location for the raid or maybe a new strike is what it looks like
---
Yep.
---
It‚Äôs definitely possible. Zavala, Shax each have 5, drifter has a good 10, Tess has 6-8, each planetary has 3, Hawthorne has like 6-8(?), banshee now has bounties, ada, Calus‚Äôs robot dude, etc. 
---
Might depend on how many you‚Äôve done already.
---
Question is how much time do you have...
---
EPIC!!!!!
---
Riding this one to the top bois
---
I have mulligan and shield disorient with a targetting adjuster mod. The mulligan+ targetting adjuster makes invading a breeze, though i actually don't personally enjoy invading since it's usually i wipe the enemy out get insta dunked. The shield disorient helps with the envoys, after which the hammerhead can kinda just be saved for invaders coming through since the lmg type weapons aren't the best for boss dps.
---
My gambit weapon loadout is finished off with Jotunn and breakneck. Though breakneck is mostly just to generate orbs to get my titan bubble to frustrate invaders, so any masterworked primary would probably do.
---
Yup, this is the correct answer. If you are running at an isolated hunter while in super, pretty much the *only * thing they can do is try to jump over you. So just run up, wait for them to commit, track the jump and be where they land. Ez.
---
I'd rate it a good 6.5/10 for Pvp. you really want max range on these types of hand cannon so you really want to find perks like rangefinder or slideshot in the second column aswell as a range masterwork. the only redeeming perk on this roll is ricochet rounds and rampage.
---
R/curedimages
---
I get that, and I agree.  I forgot I had cayde boxes and opened them last month, I still have the treasure hunter things that show you boxes that he used to sell.  I thought about trying to see if he is still there with a new a new toon or if he‚Äôs just straight gone.
---
What was your loadout?
---
Aw. Yea. I still only wear Memory of Cayde armor pieces.
---
this is an **anti boomer zone**
---
Fight Fire Sword with sword
---
It‚Äôs a game changer in crucible. You can cut corners so much quicker and sharper and when using your dodge you can swing the camera around faster so you can see more of what‚Äôs going around you in 3rd person or quickly 180 away from a situation. I usually out maneuver striker titans or supers in general because I cut corners in such sharp angles. I highly suggest it. Once I got on it I never play crucible w/o it. It‚Äôs a must for me.
---
Mine is on nessus in that broken little ball thing. I stop by it whenever I come past.
---
Strike kills must be done with the element of the day. Change that subclass and weapons all just to be safe.
---
Take a joke ya √ºber nerd
---
One was more than enough grinding
---
Well that‚Äôs what the titan striker does now with their super. Crazy drop shield plus health regen and insanely long super durations.
---
Gotta flex with all three characters on farm during the New Light release.
---
It undoubtedly will. My hope is with gambit and g'prime being kinda sorta fused down the line the environment will be less appealing to afk farm in the first place, then maybe implementing some kind of system to ban players for having multiple "0 enemies killed, 0 motes deposited, 0 boss damage" games in a certain time span. 
---
Surely they must have some kind of way to track these kinds of stats... i mean, Riot Games can tell me how many times i pressed Q on a champion in a year so the tech is out there somewhere.
---
Don't worry about masterworking, you will be able to do that even after the event.  
---
Besides, on Shadowkeep release, we will receive 2.0 versions of that armor.
---
I thought it ended last week and I grinded out 2 sets in 3 ^1/2 days
---
B-b-b-but... shiny glow :(
---
Come on, any legendary sniper with pvp perks is MUCH better than Izanagi.
---
wp anyways
---
It would need a major overhaul, having 3 random super bullets will not make it a d2 exotic.  Ace of spades is still much better, love the design though.
---
I was really on the fence about even trying Gambit,  now I am certain I don't want to go near it.
---
People use it just for fun. Legendary snipers with pvp perks are still the better option.
---
doing redrix and not forgotten at the same time. my mind went from from normal to  "fuck you bungie"- levels of toxic.
---
today i just made an oath to not even try pvp if the next pinnicle pvp quest is even half as cancer.
---
hopefully it will be more like recluse and revoker
---
Yes. Welcome to Bungie physics.
---
This guy gets it!!
---
Yay thanks
---
When it's fun, Gambit is really fun. But when it's not it's miserable.
---
When you get to a higher light you can also re-acquire it from the collections and it will scale up.
---
The game I play is good
---
The game others play is bad
---
If someone complains that it's just recycled D1 content, slap them in the face.
---
Imagine it's a cayde special emblem in there.
---
As if this place is any better.
---
Well, it is. But barely.
---
He is worthy!
---
Don't cross the streams
---
Pc player here. I fucking hope so. and weapons aswell, im getting tired of holding the same origin story copy.
---
I‚Äôve started to play Destiny 2 this summer and i have to say that Gambit is a really good mode and the result of the match can quickly change in few seconds.
---
Follow the objectives, once you‚Äôve done the whole set visit tower again to upgrade to next set then rinse and repeat.
---
Too bad the speed/distance is affected by framerate. Console players get the satisfaction of doing it, not much zoom.
---
How ornaments work is they first appear in a box you have to manually open. This is so that you can get a refund if you wish. I believe it shows up in the "modifications" tab of the inventory.
---
What fusion rifle is that?
---
Range is any of the green runes.
---
Cool, so you're the the team I'm playing every other game.
---
Don‚Äôt cross the streams!!
---
The two seasonal crucible ones
---
I sharded my one two punch shotty not knowing what it was :(
---
Wizened rebuked w Rangefinder underpressure
---
I see.  Very cool.  Wonder what that will be like.
---
Can I get uuuuuuh..  lil context.
---
There's a limit.
---
A. Thats the playerbases problem because of corporate greed. Bungie still made out like bandits selling a game that was advertised as an mmofps that had literally NO GAMEPLAY LOOP until they brought back the shit that was original to destiny 1 and released THREE. FULLY PAID. DLCS.
---
B. Theres no reason they cant strive to make reparations, except that that would require Bungie admitting that it was wrong and shit all over their playerbase. Shit like "Arc week" where they do shit like BASIC, SIMPLE NUMBERS ADJUSTMENTS, is not a reparation, its literally sticky notes at the nottom of whats supposed to be ACTUAL, CONSISTENT PATCHES AND BALANCE CHANGES.
---
Inb4 classic "durhur armchair dev" response. (Not from you personally, just in general.) If you guys are okay with giving bungie 250$ for a video game You guys are gonna go straight into debt when you play literally any other MMO that has ever existed and find out the people that make the game actually give a fuck about their playerbase and the game itself and arent just in it for the money, as has been proven time and time again from bungie. Source: apparently bungies earnings reports, literally years of eververse controversy as evidenced by the consistent state of the bungie forums FOR YEARS at this point, multiple major media outlets (literally just google destiny 2 bad or YongYeas videos covering the major media coverage for specific case by case examples.), etc etc
---
Right now you can go up to 380 by doing challenges that refresh each week and give "Powerful Gear." I believe all players have access to: 
---
* Gain xp for your clan (see the LFG megathread linked in the subreddit header for recruiting clans)
---
* Crucible
---
* Gambit 
---
* Strikes
---
* Nightfall
---
* Flashpoint (hover over a planet NPC whose planet has the gold circle icon)
---
* Eva Levante's package opening challenge for Solstice of Heroes
---
Crucible, strikes, whatever shows up on the director.
---
sicc
---
Anyone else never touched Gambit mode here?
---
Hope so
---
You keep saying "disable" do you mean enable?
---
Thanks brother
---
What problem? Im on pc and im playing on the 13th.
---
Ive suffered so much recently, im a newer player, been about a month. No one i know wants to play gambit with me, because they all already got the seal. Meanwhile, i join a team where im one of two people and were getting stomped and teammate says just throw. Gambits filled with bots and four stacks and its been a living hell trying to solo que.
---
You‚Äôre going to be 750 in October no matter what
---
Wish I even had a raid team. No one in my clan plays anymore‚òπ
---
