So I was part of the original group that started my clan. As dumb as it sounds how does one even clan hop? Just do Strikes, turn on voice and be like.. y'all clans looking for a magic lad?

---
That was the last one I read. It's nice but I dont like the ending.
---
Did anyone else hear the raid wipe sound? Or just me?
---
My videoing skills suck btw
---
Speaking of which wtf do I do with these baryon boughs?  I have over 1000 and can’t find where to spend them.
---
I got a bunch of guilt associated with this ol' girl.  My angelic fireteam helped me farm this for hours and hours, and a short time later Forsaken dropped and it was obsolete.
---
No one used game chat for some reason, I would recommend using r/destinyclanfinder
---
That sounds like a pretty nice idea I might hop on that boat!

This is a game I played just this minute. Come on, this is absolutely ridiculous. This is EVERY GAME lol.
---
I love when people pretend a shooter with lock on and radar requires skill.
---
yeh i need to get some friends to play with there are discord or forum to find people?
---
Which planets have best settings and missions to play in i just went to earth not seen anything else yet.

thanks

I never said anything about Titans needing exotics to compete. Only that hunters are the best pvp class. Mobility is the single most important factor in pvp, they have it in spades. Something has come along that challenges hunters place at the top and everyone is angry. I don't have it and it's almost never used against me. So the outrage I see is suspicious. Metas are cyclical.

J got that gun on accident during Solstice... but I can't accident my way to get Recluse

Ngl I forgot 21 and revoked were pinnacle weapons lol. But I agree with this completely

Degrade from 750 with the Red War weapons i think.

---
How much is for the hunter necklaces
---
You can by tinctures of queens foil and stuff, also banshee sometimes sells the infusion material with byron boughs
---
It's certainly merch... The method you use to make it is irrelevant. It's icons they designed. Fan made art is fine, but selling it crosses a legal boundary. You might want to look into this before you get a cease and desist.
---
Ikora! Reprogram the fucking vex portal I have a bitch to kill!
---
“But the undying mi-“
---
I DON’T GIVE A SHIT!
---
Yeah man wear what you want don’t let posts like this discourage you from trying every aspect of the game out. Warlocks and hunters both have strong points and one eyed mask is one of the Titans strongest exotic pieces. People constantly complain on both sides it’s inevitable with a pvp game. Just play how you want and heck em all.
---
Thx!!
---
Damn assgoles...
---
Sigh.... this is why no one can have fun in destiny. I’m all for nerfing and reworking blatantly op/broken shit but not to the extent some of the destiny cry babies do.
---
Also, I don’t give 2 fucks about PvP. That shit honestly needs to be on the back burner more than it already is.
---
It’s just a lost sector
---
Uhh..... he went to... umm... the Cosmodrone... yeah....
---
*moves robot in front of friend's dismembered arm and blood leading towards Shaxx's dungeon*
---
You make it a point to say people who don't agree with you either haven't read the lore or don't care, but you yourself have just incorrectly summarized at least two parts of it.
---
Mara didn't try to steal Oryx's throne world and fail. I mean, you do understand that she already had a throne world via Riven before Oryx arrived right? Why would she want/need two? Plus, Mara herself explains *in the lore* that her plan was to get taken into Oryx's throne world, steal something, wait, and break out. Here is the excerpt that you appear to have completely missed/didn't understand:
---
 *It is, on that level, a very simple bank heist:* ***Get yourself taken into the treasury as treasure, and when the owner dies, break back out with his stuff.***
---
So no, she wasn’t trying to steal the entire bank. Just the stuff inside. And if you read the reverie dawn lore, Mara reveals she indeed succeeded and got what she needed from Oryx. Again, see this exerpt from the lore:
---
*She steps through the ruins. In the end, there is nothing. Nothing but Mara Sov and the howling of rampant, untamed logics.*  
---
***Her great and terrible gamble has paid off.***  
---
*The rest is up to her now.*
---
 It's never revealed what, but a popular theory going around is that she stole the tablets of ruin (the things that gave Oryx the power to take).
---
So please, fact-check yourself and make sure what you are saying is correct before you summarize the lore for people.
---
I’m pretty sure this is photoshop. In the picture there is at least 4,400 Mind Components. If this person plays ONLY Vex Offensive, not counting queue times, he would have to get about 22 mind components per hour, consistently.
---
I think guardians dont at all and as we know they can't die unless their ghost is killed but I think everytime they die they do still take a bit of wear and tear as seen with older quardians saying things like the drifter mentioning starvation.
---
So basically no they don't age and are in their prime
---
Although this brings up exo

When revived what reboot is revived?

And are they immune to exo defficency?

why do we play games, for fun OF COURSE!

Didn't need to be patched, i mean I dunno why people complain about this so much while people go around with shotguns.
---
I'd fist fight him amount of time he has yelled in my goddamn ear while I'm trying to be sneaky dude gives me away all the damn time -.-
---
Ngl though Shaxx could easily be my motivator, helped me clutch a match lol
---
Hear, hear!
---
Is that just shards of galanor you're running? Or do you have some mods too to help get it back?
---
That’s just a place everyone knows about, the game is gorgeous if you stop and look.
---
May be dumb but have you tabbed down to the appearance page while inspecting your gauntlets?
---
"Boom, headshot!"

Ok I play titan and I hate OEM but at least it stops  the stupid shotgun ape with insurmountable meta.(btw synthetheps all the way.)

I recently played Foetracker as huntermain.  
---
the wallhack is fking amazing in scoutmeta...  
---
u win every long range trade, cause u know where he peaks...  
---
and the dmgbuff was quite fun witch cancERCLUSE hehe  
---
foetracker new cancer after tuesday?!
---
when you are a lowly Ewok fighter watching some Jedi shit going down
---
When I was working on Randy's I saw a few Sweet Businessmen and honestly they were never remotely a problem.  And this was when I was done with scout rifle kills and was using Cerberus to make the grind more fun, so I would have been a prime target for them.  Maybe the ones I fought just weren't great, but the impression I got was that it was more of a novelty build.
---
Straight facts
---
That’s pretty dope ngl
---
Maybe fun, but useful?? Nahhhhh

Does it shoot the same way cuz that's the important part, I like that type of recoil

Cool username, AGiantEvilPanda.

So in the anime people use ODM gear but the TITANS have OEM semms about right.

Quick question, do you have Forsaken? Because you dropped a Forsaken exotic and I'm trying to find out if I can drop them without having it
---
It isn't META, but who cares? Avoid mid range fights and be evasive. 2 primaries is a load out that needs teamwork to be effective. Try it, and if you have fun then you know you're doing it right.

What would you like to be posted

Why? You’re running the strongest load out in the game.
---
Head cannon should be an exotic titan helm
---
Are other guardians just that terrible at everything? They had 1.5 raid teams for a damn strike and still got crystallised. It’s natural selection at that point.
---
oh, that's not bad. as long as my health regen and the melee range buff don't go away they can do whatever
---
We tried 920 hero version no full wipes but those fucking ogres tooks us to long to kill i think end like 92k any tips?

I did a nightfall strike

Ahhhhh okay that makes sense now.

Alls ya gotta do is have a single thrall hit you and then everything within a 5 mile radius is evaporated via electricity
---
“Um -coughs- excuse me, does this come in dark mode?”
---
I ear crayons a lot.  They're always super waxy though.  🤷‍♂️
---
That's what I figure.  Like the pressure of the darkness in certain areas overcomes our ghost.
---
I like to think that these underpaid and overworked developers are doing it on purpose because there are some fat cat execs who don’t have any clue these things are from other games.

You're his favorite guardian

Dang, i’m sorry. best of luck to you for getting it PC much be must harder

I don’t think u do I never use a bow in gambit and I’m almost done with that step

Well I’ve done like 6 in the past week and gotten zero so don’t you feel special

I had this happen to me on GoS. Wish I had a picture

Well the nubs at 5500 you see probably got carried

EXACTLY

I was waiting for someone to come along and quote this.

I am new, can someone explain what I am seeing?

Technically a repost but not really

Ok but can we talk about screws? Why the fuck are square heads not standard? Literally the only head type it's impossible to strip.

I like the 40K purity seals.

Ouch. I'm sorry for your loss (of time), man. Godspeed.

He’s the hunter not the warlock lol

My pleasure :)

peacekeepers would like to talk

with that logic they should rename all player names too
---
The fact you got him with the last round in your mag made the win that much better
---
No, we are essentially gods remember? We are some of the strongest guardians who've ever been around. We can switch our subclasses in an instant, which is a technique that requires mastery of the light (source... hardcase helm? One of the blue titan helmets)
---
According to Calus, we are the strongest humans he's ever seen, that's why he pick (player character) as his shadow, because he expects his shadows to kill off the rest of their species at some point.
---
We entered the infinite forest, which no one has ever came out of alive, not even saint 14 who was one of the strongest heroes before us.
---
Finally, we have plot armor. They dont. According to taeko the wizards literally ripped the light out of guardians, so we were lucky they didnt do the same to us and permanently instakill us
---
That's what the recluse will do
---
I wish they did, comp is supposed to be super easy this season, I went up to 5k straight and regarding the enemy team they aren't nearly as good as the ones I had all previous seasons but my mates are not even bad, they're more than useless, they die so often I could just fly in solo and I'd do better. It's as if they're in a waiting line just to get matched into my team, I already think I am haunted
---
I was the 420th, you’re welcome
---
I see it more of an exploit of a weak spot in the design of the game.
---
If let’s say, everyone catches on and decides they want to use the same strat on both sides and nobody sommuns the prime evil that is a broken system. If you can break the game by using this “strat” than it’s not intended to operate in that way.
---
I mean I would love to just have a gunplay destiny without all the supers and heavies and ridiculous melees and gamechanging exotics. But I guess the way I should have put it is I’m not going to put myself at a disadvantage.
---
Might be a bad comparison, but I'm tired of child labor hate. I know that it's annoying to insanity, but the employers do what they gotta do to make money right? They only do it when they're short of cash.
---
It is intended tho, otherwise it wouldn't be possible, a good team that knows their opponents are doing that can easily shut them down
---
What the hell is the purple circle circle circling?
---
Good good

Deserves a UPDOOT!
---
yo is izanagi lock and key quest still bugged? 
---
if yes, any news about when they'll patch it?

Im interested in seeing it, might he was with some blueberries
---
Gun reticle haha, was too lazy to remove it
---
Lunas quack 🦆
---
I almost managed this two weeks ago or so. Had 17 guardian kills in total.
---
Keep on trying! You'll make it! I solo qued to recluse as a warlock, and trust me, all you. Need to do is keep on trying. The loss of points is around 10x times smaller than the gain. 200 per win, 20 lost per loss. You can do this!
---
Because it's not like they are labeled chronologically and some of the books are collections of short stories out of order it's not as simple as reading the Harry Potter books in order because they don't really follow a straight line and a lot of people highly recommend Fall of Reach and others aren't nearly as recommended so I don't want to waste my time with something I won't like just to get a chronological order of events I don't care about the order of events the games hardly ever followed a straight line there's always a time jump and the main reason I said in my other comment I started the promethean saga book on audible is because the reviews said it was a really goods sci-fi story in general even if you weren't a Halo fan or read any of the previous books so I thought that would be a good way to introduce me to some more new lore ultimately you are correct and I am being lazy by simply not reading them right now but this is my reasoning and I believe it's not entirely ludicrous so I hope you understand my thought process.
---
Well if everyone has 15 or 20 motes and no one summons the game won’t be very exciting.
---
Isn't this basically what the whole game is?
---
Auschwitz gang?
---
You just burned all your luck in one go. See you in the next life time
---
I don’t think it’s an intentional component to playing gambit...
---
The point is to both work toward summoning your prime and first to take it out wins.
---
The fact that the team who is first to summon is at a direct disadvantage is a broken system.
---
It’s a cheese.
---
Yes except one of these is a serious problem in the real world while the other is a problem in fictional media. Also, this is implying that Child Labor and Titan cheese are on the same level of terrible.
---
Ill dm in a bit, still playing comp
---
I had 18 that game.
---
played some more yesterday, [and absolutely slaughtered the enemy team](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/766101851245125509/86EF252A2CB3F262C6E8602C98CE6A3FA99DAA91/)
---
The team who is first isnt at a disadvantage. You are only at a disadvantage if you aren't good at countering invaders.
---
Gate Lord? It’s on the moon when the lightning is visible.
---
Ye
---
Yeah but that involves a bit of strategy!
---
The ornament just adds two stripes on it basically.
---
You know the only cabal weapon ik of is skyburners path but what about a Psionic slug
---
"Everywhere I go, I see his face"
---
I think everybody is after this for PVE, in terms of PVP, I think hard light is the same or better.
---
Frankly, I am also as lost as a babe in the woods. I got it free with Playstation Plus.
---
You can play the campaign which is a single player game this time round, unlike Destiny 1. It is quite fun like Halo. But when people talk about Destiny, it is always referring to the PvE raids which I haven't done yet.
---
Imagine using your brain instead of feeding kills to the opposition.
---
I could make this in 58 mins
---
word up to this
---
Dude, you know that your a bad person when over 75% of your karma is from the destiny fashion subreddit. Lol, I'm just messing around at this point, all I was trying to say, is that if you get into the sweater games, you will notice that very skilled snipers will always favour the better sniper over the revoker. Supremacy, alone as a god, oath kepper, are all known as the top snipers because thier aim assist is anywhere between 65-78 (I believe) where revoker is around... 45? Also targeting adjuster ads +10 auto aim if that puts it in perspective.
---
edge transit is so good, i reached 6900 glory using it
---
When I used chaos reach plus geomag it technically can go on forever as long you do damage and get some kills in between with ads to keep the super from running out. Last time I did this was before shadowkeep tho so may or may not be a thing anymore
---
Question about 5 of sword challenge card from xur ,  
---
so my friend and i was running 920 strike and then i realised we are very close to 100k we are at 93k , so im wondering does using 5 of sword will help? and how do you use this card?  and which modifier will we get?is it random?
---
We have that down it’s just that we do not get enough time for the last room
---
i play on pc. i got the game for free the day it was released on steam. ive been playing for a while but i still don’t know much about the game other than the basics. i think i’m like 910-915 light but that’s just by farming crucible and doing challenges. my friends made me download it and i just joined their fire team and jumped right in. i want to understand the lore and story because it’s gets a little boring to just shoot random stuff.
---
Just remember, once you get rid of your forsaken, you can't grow it back.
---
Maybe some of the Guardians had more Void Light in them than others? Idk
---
I think you have to beat the campaign and then you'll be able to get the stash.
---
Yeah, it’s not letting people who just got the quest from ada after the SK launch get the first 3 keys now, it really sucks
---
Cuz it's already so many years ppl just sometime wanna play with their friends and not forced into campaign...adn u have the option just go and start the campaign that's allll
---
what do you mean by rewards? my friend told me you get an exotic upon completion. is that not the case anymore?
---
I did
---
I just prefer a more clean Design. Like Sythosyeps, I don't like points stuff. Like the Wild ears.

Get yourself a handcannon and slot in the artifact mod for stunning unstoppable champions.. and you'll carve through the ogres easily.

It's more than possible to take out Savvy's Song without using Taeko's crystal. That's probably just a gameplay thing and not what happened canonically, but still.

Since they made D2 a free to play, they probably felt that forcing players to grind from 0 to 900 light level through the campaign would draw players away

I have no shame using it in pvp. People that bitch about it are the same people that complain about awpers in counter strike. It's part of the game, deal with it.
---
That's correct. I had another older player tell me to play the campaign to get a choice of a few exotics... so I did. You don't get any exotics from Redwar or Warmind anymore. You can get a handful from a few quests now.
---
&amp;#x200B;

Basically, they're only worth doing for the storyline now. Which sucks, I was very excited to see what I'd get at the end, after dumping a few hours into the campaigns.

could be that i mixed that with cross-save and moving to another system (in that case you have to buy dlc again).

920 was a piece of cake because of matchmaking. If 980 had matchmaking, i'd just kept trying until eventually i did find a decent team. But i need to find them beforehand and all of them so far are just idiots that don't work together, don't bring mods and then leave. Want to just get it over with, get that ship and get one step closer to the Undying seal.

Titans can get a bonus grenade charge and extended time on the effect.
---
Yeah. Don't really see that at legend cus they get shit on. Thank God it's getting nerfed. Jotünn needs a buff/nerf. It should have less aggressive tracking, but be able to cook my toast.
---
I believe the stash was a pre order exclusive.
---
2nd clip hard to see because I wasnt directly watching but Well of radiance probs went underground
---
Make the screen go POV of the rocket like the redeemer in UT
---
I did... then I gave up lol I'm upto 700 odd points now though so there's that
---
I prefer loud lullaby retold tale and synthoceps
---
Why would anyone who ist interested in winning stop using oem?
---
If you play for wins you play meta weapons and whatever unfair exotic you want. It's not the players fault that oem is broken.
---
It's like complaining that people use hammerhead in gambit.
---
Bungie needs to fix/change these things. It's their job to balance pvp not the player's.
---
his “terrible meme” really hit close to home for you huh weirdchamp
---
Where can I play them?
---
Ooof big mood
---
Dps is shit. Lol
---
its mayhem there's no objective but to spam supers lol. but its true hunters are pretty solid in PvP &amp; PvE. titans &amp; warlocks can be op in PvP also but you have to work harder from my pov of playing all 3. From a D1 vet, you'll learn to adapt &amp; when an exotic is op people complain about it even though they can access it themselves just like everyone else until it gets nerfed &amp; they move on to the next best exotic. Gambit is living proof of that. Sleeper got nerf then Queensbreaker took its place, that got nerfed then it was Thunderlord or any machine gun or Truth. So far machine guns got a little nerf but they still have Truth &amp; if Truth gets nerfed then Leviathan's Breath will be king until its nerfed &amp; something else takes its place. So long story short have fun until its nerfed.

I.e. my solstice armor from last year, faction gear or basically everything. There’s so many nice armors basically never to be seen anymore and you‘re „forced“ to wear armor you probably don’t even like.
---
I'm aware, I'm just wondering if the exact (Non exotic) armor piece matters or do only the stats matter
---
Imo both of them have their point. Sure we cant risk waging war on the reef with every single guardians and left the city defenseless, we dont want a Cabal 2.0 in the last cỉty. But at least Zavala could have do something, this is Cayde we talking about, like send out a fireteam and help us track down Uldren or his fanatics. Instead he did nothing, i agree Ikora was driven by her emotion at that moment but zavala was no better, he may be a pro-leader but a heartless friend
---
Mountaintop: A Kinetic Grenade Launcher that requires 125 Kills, 25 Multikills and 75 Medals to obtain. It's quite hard to do due to the nature of Kinetic and Energy Grenade Launchers in PvP. It's one of the top tier weapons to use in game and you'd be an idiot not to abuse Shadowshot. That's how I got mine and I'm happy about it.
---
Hard feels. Im somewhere between numbers 18-27
---
The stats and mods matter
---
It's all about playstyle of titans where most can be basically melee, which for me is good example of shitting on this class. If you want to kill somevody with melee you have get to this person first, which can be problematic, not even saying that i've seen people doing much worse things in pvp using hunters and warlocks. Did you knew that there are people shooting smg or shotgun (normal shotgun not one with rifle slugs) at long range? It hurts while looking at it when they gets obliterated by enemy snipers...
---
Don’t feel bad about it, crucible is torment, I just wanted to make a meme
---
No assists you scrub. /s
---
Gg well played.
---
its 950 yes
---
How did you come to decision "Yeah, definitely gonna make reddit post about it"? What made you do it?
---
The Traveler would most probably be able to reach it if it had gone any higher.
---
Someone draw that Titan with a drink.
---
HERE I GO, SHINING FINGER!!!!
---
1. Hello, internet explorer. 
---
2. 5500 and NF is not a feat anymore. Any casual can get it now. Bungie keep feeding their players with a spoon.
---
3. Almost any other hand cannon is better now. NF is a garbage not worth the effort.
---
4. Rule 11: No loot posts
---
Keep  all loot/achievement posts to the end of the week thread for them. This  includes 'should I keep this roll' or 'is this roll good' posts. Those  belong in [r/sharditkeepit](https://www.reddit.com/r/sharditkeepit).

This guy gets it

Dude, what the hell. You can't make a screenshot and you can't even rotate them properly?
---
Some shitposts are of an excellent quality.
---
And some shitposts are like this.
---
Literally taken on my phone in the middle of a raid
---
You willing to pay for it
---
It’s more like I hit him with 2 bursts on a three burst he lives gets wallhacks and and an over shield and now gets free reign over any 1v1
---
I'm the odd one out it's practically their first clear 
---
We been on the last boss for 3 days (obviously not nonstop) I stuck with them because I rather get a group I can work with instead of looking for randoms all the time so I stuck with it and we finally got it down
---
The Traveler sent the MLMliens packing after they plagued the earth with there essential oil schemes.
---
Yes.
---
Anyone? Lol
---
but I don't see too good...
---
Oh okay, thanks
---
-lay off the boost on your sparrow near the end of a ramp and slam back on it quickly to get a huge boost of speed and get around maps waaay faster (something to remember if they ever bring back the SRL)
---
-always reload in the air. You don't lose your momentum that way.
---
- never wait through all of a gun's reload animation. Once you see the ammo box fill up, the gun is effectively reloaded, even if there's a few more seconds of your guardian pushing the bolt back, or whatever. Instead, switch weapons. Lot of times, it's even faster to switch to an alt weapon then switch back to the original (now loaded) first weapon. This is particularly true with machine guns, hand cannons, fusion rifles, and semi-auto snipers. This is super important for raid bosses.
---
-Recovery, particularly for Warlocks, is crazy useful considering how many ways they can heal themselves. Don't sleep on it, especially if you prefer Well of Radiance, or a close range build involving either Karnstain Armlets or Path of Hunger Voidwalker.
---
So someone can't take a joke?
---
Yeah, as much as I hate Shotties, at least any class can use it. I'm a OEM Bubble Titan, so I'm part of the problem, but I just LOVE how OEM looks. Skele-helm is nice.
---
Yeah was thinking I'm new to this game but I never have a problem getting matched up at all, seems very active.
---
I can relate to this so much!
---
I have lost count of the half completed games I have, that I always say 'I'll just play D2 this weekend then I'll go back to the other game' Weeks later I've forgotten the other game exists. 
---
This is the main thing I love about D2, I can always get completely lost in it!
---
If they got 9 together for a strike they have far stronger matchmaking powers than I do.
---
I should have
---
With the new light changes, any frame can be completed at any forge now.
---
Actually OEM is OP. The tracking alone makes it very powerful. Combine that with the overshield regen and damage boost you have the most busted exotic armor this franchise has ever seen. It literally makes other exotics (Foetracer) worthless.
---
Use mountaintop with stickies and spam them EVERYWHERE. The ground? Yes. The ceiling? Of course. On the wall? You betcha. Their face? Obviously. Way up in the map where no sane person would jump to? You never know when the stompee users wanna go for a joy ride. The amount of people who walk over them when its right in their face is astounding.
---
God I used to be "We're only good cus *blank*", then I got better and understood we're ALL OP. Still use OEM as a fashion cus I love how it looks. That's really the only reason I like it. It really needs a rework or nerf.
---
shut up and take my money
---
Get yourself a squad
---
I believe that one is technically a year 1 weapon which was before they added mod slots to weapons, I think some weapons got updated versions but not the y1 nightfall exclusives afaik.
---
??
---
normally id call this circlejerk but its true. literally scroll for a minute or two and 95% of the posts will be complaining, bitching, and/or whining.
---
Might as well be happy to be able to hold a spoon propelry, but we won't praise people for something that simple unless they have some sort of disability.
---
Wow you could have fooled me
---
And I have question! Is suros good for pve/sitting in good spot? Like would u take it over sweetbussines (with war rig?)?
---
Just get a shotgun.
---
I dont believe that's true, do you have a source?
---
When I talk to Holiday in the hanger I can take the first three campaigns as “legacy campaign” pursuits, does that not appear for you?
---
Just to be clear, this was super confusing for me and my fiancée too. We bought the Forsaken complete edition like a week before Shadowkeep and had only made it through Osiris, it was pretty off putting at first! 😂
---
Do you.. do you know the internet? Someone already has more then likely.
---
"They're harvesting Guardians!"
---
It’s like a Ford in a sense that It’ll do everything ok but it’s not the best in all situations, more often I prefer ikelos shotty or a decent fusion rifle depends on energy requirements 
---
Running normal strikes and story missions recluse saves a lot of time but 100k, nightmares and zero hour heroic? Not a chance
---
What do you mean "as seen above thorn is good". He doesn't even shoot it once haha
---
Yeah I did that aswell, it's only showing shader options on all gauntlets I have tried..
---
Ah i see.. then i got to grind more gear then... so hard tho &gt;_&lt;
---
I did try it yeah, but it's only giving me shader options on all gauntlets I have..
---
Not from me, having recluse suggests a veteran who understands the mechanics unlike the noobs.
---
His ghost must've had a hell of a time putting that back together.
---
I believe you cannot obtain the quest anymore, as it was a pinnacle weapon and tied to the season it was released in. Please correct me if I am wrong.
---
cheers all
---
I have tried it with old 750 gauntlets I already had, with ones I got from reckoning, the reaper and collector ones and random 920 gauntlets I got during a strike. All of these are only showing shader options.. I don't own Shadowkeep, not sure if that matters..
---
Whether we liked it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Darkness on Mars, so let's get to taking out their command.
---
I seriously doubt you can hold a conversation properly let alone a spoon
---
I just had this idea for the meme a couple days ago but was too lazy to make it.. good meme
---
It was double nerfed because they nerfed Rampage across the board, but also nerfed Onslaught. It’s a huge bummer. Breakneck was one of my favorite guns.
---
Yeah, it honestly makes sense though. 100k is a pinnacle reward, so needing to complete the 950 to get 100k seems reasonable for me.
---
"forced" gee i wonder why they would lock a quest for a PVP ritual weapon behind playing pvp with this precise weapon type ! So unbelievable
---
I was playing on Nessus last night and I unknowingly stepped in some radiolarian fluid and started to get hurt. My girlfriend sitting next to me screamed “get out of the spicy milk!” and then died of laughter at her own joke.
---
I did breakneck, malfeasance, and Dredgen all solo queue. To anyone wondering... no, your teammates do NOT get better.
---
Yeah it was nerfed and still managed to retain that title.
---
I don't want to believe it will see what happens when next season comes
---
Wow shaxx doesn’t even uses the weapons he gives us
---
 As a new light i reached 950, what should i do i dont have forsaken but i buyed shadowkeep
---
My guy be looking like spongebob 
---
 [https://prnt.sc/poqm4r](https://prnt.sc/poqm4r)
---
worst delivered line for me by far is the "no! turn back!"
---
And another one is coming next week now stfu
---
yeah I like this sub but for asking questions and making suggestions I would say DTG is better
---
Yeah man you come into destiny at a good time you have a whole grind in front you hope you enjoy it. Yeah there whole evevrse system is a mess
---
Bungie should make new stuff not keep reusing what I already paid for
---
I agree with you it's great tight now. I'm just worried about these future seasons coming up
---
Damn, that sucks. If I were you I would try to message support, idk if they have a phone line but if they do then I would try that. Email them if you can. I’m pretty sure you can do something like a support ticket or something, so if you can, then do that. Do everything you can. Also, do you have any idea how long he van is? Maybe you got banned for network or something you couldn’t control, but it might only be for a couple of days. Maybe if it’s really short you’ll just have to wait it out. Good luck!
---
Never quit a gambit match but I’ve left plenty of crucible matches without getting banned. Although you may find yourself restricted from that gameplay type for some time if you do it too much too often.
---
not to call you out, but i don’t see a signature on this... it’s rather popular for people to steal art and claim it’s their own on this sub (and basically all others, but that goes without saying).
---
Nope I’ve only just found about armour 2.0 don’t know much about the rolls but my old gear is now useless 🙄😂
---
U/PacNWgamer Did you pick up the quest called “Shock and Denial” from Lord Shaxx? That’s the first part of the entire quest line.

You need to choose the Survival playlist. That's the only competetive mode that offers Glory points.
---
it was handthere, now it’s **handgonne**
---
Thanks!
---
I got Antaeus wards last week
---
Survival awards glory.
---
The glory playlist is the survival mode. If you are playing alone, there is a freelance version so you won’t be put against teams.
---
Nvm I was being stupid
---
Thank you very much buddy.
---
Imagine asking someone else to get a life while arguing a pretty irrelevant and honestly moot point on Reddit in a long chain of comments yourself. Hmmmm....
---
its so fuckinh easy mate
---
But what if i wanna turn into a shield
---
Its totally random.
---
Oh yes
---
I've never heard someone complain about getting a better rank than they should
---
Thanks man.
---
it isn't I mean playing a six stack yes them thinking they are skilled no
---
r/Terraria
---
basically 2D Minecraft but it came out before Minecraft
---
Thanks buddy.
---
Wut
---
No problem. Use the freelance survival playlist if you're playing alone.
---
it was three in the morning nothing better to do
---
Excited to help her deal with the final nightmare... Eriana-3
---
Does Eva Levante  provide the oven for that?
---
wdym diamond sword and priorities? 1. Terraria came out before MC, and 2. there are no guns in MC
---
you aren't wrong
---
Tell him to go near a phalanx and wait to get r/phalanxed
---
I get what he's saying but using it just makes the issue larger and I find myself more than capable of getting wins without it
---
no problem
---
Best method seems to be doing as many bounties as possible and turning them in with a fireteam to get more experience
---
Bounties and fireteams for the boost
---
you don’t need any resets for the title tho?
---
No problem 👍🏻
---
I wish we got to see ai guardians in the open world. Not like they are killing but still just them in combat. Make it look like it isnt literally just you/us.
---
I love destiny but lately at the end of every gambit game, I wanna take a fucking axe to my XBONE. Especially when you hit an invader with your super, he then disappears, 2 seconds later reappears and kills you.
---
They reduced some of the steps for the MT by a lot, so it's easier then ever to get it
---
You need 3 resets to get the ghost shell which is part of the collection tab
---
I didn’t advertise man.
---
You can't teabag it's 2019
---
As long as back up plan is a perk nerfing the charge time will never make a difference. :-)
---
i’m referring to *Undying* not *Dredgen*
---
I love being in a Gambit match, near win, and getting a disconnect..  then getting a penalty warning..   #FuckYouBeeErrorMessage
---
Oh it doesn’t? Then I believe ricochet rounds would be the best
---
Me too don’t know da hell it is
---
Ok for the izanagis I’m at the last key and I’m killing leviathan underbelly watcher
---
Getting 2100 this season is like getting 500 in previous ones if not easier. But congrats nevertheless
---
It’s one of those things from elementary school where they teach you about multiplication in bundles (3d objects) so you can learn math visually.
---
My clan is pretty active, and a good group of people. Try out Arctic Wolf Fs 
---
Ps you can change your psn name once for free if you wanna change it ;)
---
It’s like getting 200 lol
---
I mean I got numerous games of 2v3 and completely skunked the enemy team 0-4
---
Worst example? It's the principle that you have to think of. Because something is on sale it's fine? 20 bucks for a mediocre shirt is not great. Just because it is on sale you get tricked for being fine. It is a marketing strategies used by big companies for decades! The only thing flawed is it  affecting woman only, but that was just the joke part if you couldn't tell
---
*Indeed*
---
I know that some clans have a discord that you can post LFG posts in
---
I equipped a sword with the matching element for the step and ran around hitting everything with the  sword without ammo. It counts as a melee ability. This works on a Titan not sure if it works on other classes.
---
\^This guy gets it, lol
---
Well I'm not the best crucible player and your probably way better than me.
---
Had to play back.
---
&gt;Empty weapons, confirmed.
---
But what’s that tasty, not on Cool-Down ability you had there?
---
Actually The MAX is 950.. but with the seasonal artifact you can achieve 960... (I personally haven't seen anybody higher)
---
Under control? Cheaters and gamepad aimbot abusers have been running rampant since day one on PC. That's 2 years BTW...
---
Taser water and Vex CDs
---
Don’t cut yourself short I’m sure you’re pretty good. It’s all practice makes perfect if you aren’t confident in your abilities.
---
It's what I did it with. Easy enough. Took one run of vex offensive
---
Same issue here, patrol not working. @bungie can you fix this please ?
---
You're not getting the right medals. They're specific.
---
This
---
It takes a lot more to be mercied also once you reach a certain point threshold you cannot he mercied anymore
---
There was a period of about 3 hours yesterday where I was constantly getting disconnected with bee and anteaters
---
If you see a titan running you rather jump away than dodge.
---
It was translated to russian as "oil"
---
Lmao everyone slept on erentil and it was a non issue until season of opulence (s7) because it wasn’t easily farmed beforehand. Don’t sit here and try to pretend it’s been dominating for 4 seasons when it hasn’t.
---
Yeah, but since it shifted to steam, the full on modders have come out in force.  The speed mod is just game breaking.
---
Nope, he definitely broke the game
---
It’s glitched and getting fixed Tuesday
---
Two weeks ago I got Jade Rabbit from a drop on Wednesday. Then Xur sells it. This Thursday I got Geomag stabilizers as my powerful gear from Zavala . . . Xur is a master troll
---
[Yep, that's wood...](https://i.imgur.com/pWB3MHb.jpg)
---
Same.
---
Yup.
---
If you get enough reports most likely
---
I just finished this quest last night! That mote part was pain so much pain
---
Why op not read twab.
---
This is cringe.
---
Yeah, they should turn that off when their servers are shitting the bed.
---
Yeah you get a 30 minute suspension for leaving gambit matches
---
There is a PC lfg discord. Try google it: Destiny 2 PC LFG discord. Biggest pc discord so far as i know.
---
Don’t tell cayde
---
I'm a cow and I'm offended
---
No they're right that's my bad. 26 was the 26th day of inktober and dark was the prompt
---
I gave up after luna's howl (I got it but it was too much for me) lol
---
to much time? that's exactly one of the reasons it was done this way...
---
Nah it’s been around season 4
---
He can call that envoys are gone when they are both still alive.
---
exactly when the pve season ends lol the seasons page should say how many days is left in the season.
---
You're right, but on the other hand I'd be flattered if someone tried to steal it I dont think its THAT good lol
---
When the anime character starts thinking about his friends
---
Wiki says that you should get it in mission Sacrilege witch is the first story mission on IO
---
he is not in a tank people are able to put that symbol in their name
---
Isn't that essentially a chai latte?
---
Armor?
---
Yeah, when D2 came. Not anymore.
---
Yes it is a titan, not hunter that stands strong for the traveler. 
---
Bubbles for everyone!
---
add the fact that he is also the guy that revives you..... yeah. i think we should be more grateful
---
   
---
I opened 3 days ago .. and only spammers answer me.
---
Rip
---
I know. I often think is there any point in playing if I'm not going to put in a min of 4 hours this evening. 
---
Hope you are still enjoying it and not just burning yourself out
---
Gambit bang? 🤔
---
I feel this so hard, but about D1, i had a group that a played with constantly. And the whole group just broke apart right before taken king came out. We would run crota and VOG same time every week. Last thing we did was try for flawless raider (which tbh I should have probably just did solo), and 3 members of the fireteam joined a different fireteam while me and the other members were at work, and those three essentially quit after they got the platinum. My group of friends i played D2 with during Y1 were pretty trash (at raids/nightfall), so i was never able to complete a raid with them on here, but when forsaken came out, they still hadn't beat leviathan ( I spent 6+ hours trying to help them pass the dogs multiple times after forsaken launched). And half of them never even unlocked the dreaming city. I still play gambit and crucible with them sometimes though. My friends and I have a lot more going on with our lifes now, so i can't really just have a schedule for raiding anymore, but those were the good days
---
You are not my friend. You are my brother, my friend!
---
Bugged aswell for me
---
&gt;If you switch to a new profile, your progress will be at 0.
---
Not true. Due to stupid reasons (being lazy being most of the reasoning) I have two whispers, one on my Warlock, one on my Titan, they share progress. I've only run it on my Warlock, but my Titan still shows 68%, just as my Warlock does.
---
I also see other Catalysts sharing progress too.
---
Well that sucks do you know where i can get it?
---
Your joke didnt imply the flawed tshirt here i thought you were talking about merch in general.
---
Because 90% of the population of this subreddit have already done a post about how OP OEM is.
---
Maybe even fun.
---
Its a random exotic drop. So remember to visit xur, and play the game. It will drop at some point.
---
Yea I did the same thing without thinking about it
---
This is the exact reason im not going for 960 any more. 8 gloves across three characters and no kenetic or heavy after 2 weeks kind of ruined that grind for me.
---
Well through all of D1 and D2 I've spent about 5 minutes with a sniper in my hands lol. Gotta start somewhere!
---
They also seem to effect overload and unstoppable champions, based on how much people shoot them with anti barrier.
---
How's your sister
---
[deleted]
---
Thanks a lot
---
You can get it from Banshee-44, probably already have it in your quest tab. Then you just have to do the objectives
---
Okay, sorry I'll correct my error.  What I do know without doubt is that you can't make progress on one account and do it again on another for more progress.
---
Np
---
Thanks, I im new to the game (3 days) but in retrospective I should have looked in that page haha, my mistake.
---
On the "Triumphs" tab, at the bottom the requirements for each title are given.
---
I just got suros from a drop after killing a nightmare on the moon  lol
---
Oh thanks
---
IG - @ralph.the.chicken
---
Only half?
---
And? I have them all
---
they do a terrible job of identifying that the medals even need to be specific
---
Haha, i will try to get that erianas vow, I love hand cannons. I actually find the grind for luna's howl fun because even if I wasn't grinding for it, I would still play comp a lot (and probably with a hand cannon), but still, it would suck to do the grind and not get anything because the season ended hahaha.
---
Good to know, thanks. I think I will have to test it myself haha.
---
This is the first time I have heard anyone say that. After Forsaken, but before New Light, many new players would ask which story exotic to choose, so I am skeptical of this claim.
---
Do all your weekly stuff that rewards powerful gear. Gambit,crucible,strikes, bounties and all that. All those yellow stars on the destination screen..knock em out weekly until they are gone. Then hitting up comp crucible will net you a bunch of higher level stuff quicker then most activities I find.
---
I did the strike at like 920 a few times and my groups had issues. Did it again at 940 and passed it with ease....
---
What, foetracer? That hardly ever works, or even procs, and it doesn’t give you an overshield or damage buff.
---
If it helps you to feel better, most OEM titans have a small dick
---
It is connection based and tries its best to match glory and 'skill rating'. But if the system can't find anyone fast enough it fills spots with anyone, even 0 glory players
---
I've been away with a medical issue for a while and only managed to finish the necklace quest, am I screwed because I missed them or will the next one be available for me on Tuesday?
---
\*Vex Jizz
---
its okay, i like warlocks too
---
Eehhhhhhh
---
correct
---
If the Lada was a bus.
---
I mean it’s RNG when you’ll get a rare a bounty
---
Daily bounties and playing with other season pass owners helps a lot. Currently sitting at level 106 and have seen others at 150+.
---
A mate of mine who doesnt play often is already at level 40
---
That was definitely a 180
---
Thanks, no harm farming them i suppose.
---
I am a hunter main though
---
well, i mean youre right, but thorn is decent in pvp
---
You have to hit 5500 right?
---
I believe warlock to be a pretty balanced if not underpowered class, i never felt cheesed by warlocks as much as titans or fellow hunters, i actually was a warlock main back in D1 and year 1 D2 until i fell in love with triple jump
---
Requires maxed catalyst and is guaranteed.
---
Only phased enemies (they have a blue glow) will drop the batteries. 
---
Also, in that Forge, there are two other platforms where adds will spawn. Someone has to work at least one of them.
---
The first of many
---
It’s ok
---
source: me and my clanmates i do comp with
---
If you have a rare bounty probably about 3-5 hours, you need a fireteam though for the shattered throne and prymidion
---
It's a rolling weekly, like the invitations of the Nine
---
I don't believe it's related to the seasons, everyone is independent to the progress they've been making, while you won't be there with everyone to fulfill Ariana 3's memorabilia, you'll get there after the others are done, so no worries!
---
Hell no. 
---
Sincerely, Voidlock running Nezerac.
---
It's because sony and microsoft only allow crosssave and crossplay on games if sony/microsoft still receive money from after purchase sales, aka Microtransactions and dlc. 
---
This same thing has happened with fortnite. Sony threw a fit because players could buy microtransactions on PC then play on ps4 at anytime. This is why you cannot use skins bought from ps4 on PC or visa versa. You used to be able to bring skins with you when hopping platforms. Sony shut that shit down. Sony didnt like that cause you would be using a paid cosmetic on their console without paying for it on their console. Cause they take 18% cut of revenue from microtransactions and dlc. 
---
So basically blame sony. They dont like players using features that sony wants money for directly.
---
It was the crucible armor from Forsaken. I am fairly sure we can't obtain it anymore.
---
I have been trying to get Wing Discipline but no luck at all during my grind to Legend
---
No, I’m actually pretty good. I interpreted it as a flex when you mentioned you played for 5 years and heard every Shaxx line. Sounded boasty.
---
It’s not even exotic! Just get to 2100 in comp.
---
Wasn't ace day on september 4th, sinces thats when cayde died?
---
I run the exact same guns lol but I’m a warlock so technically I’m not gay
---
In about 2 hours I was over 3k
---
Hm, well I can’t help you with that.  Tone is lost through text so, I could’ve been super calm and chill or exclamatory the entire time.  You would never know, so everything relies on  your perception.  Either way, it doesn’t really make me a difference.  🤷‍♂️
---
What he said ^
---
Volundr forge is the one that won't drop for me.
---
This and Nechrochasm (but as a proper SMG)
---
The season in which they were released.

Remember to leave out the vex cookies and milk for vex santa

Majority of people from Bungie are warlocks

#IF IT WASN’T FOR THOSE PESKY TITANS!!!
---
Im just wondering if its decent cause I randomly got it during gambit
---
What if I dont have the bounty?
---
Thank you. That's a relief.
---
To be honest Legend wasn't that big of a grind, I get that you would like extra rewards but idm the way it is and enjoy it regardless
---
Okay I guess.
---
Happy cake day Guardian!
---
It’s impossible to defeat Randal.
---
Well you would still need to survive the 0.07 second recluse blast for riskrunner to proc.
---
Wouldn’t change anything
---
Very cool art.
---
Thank you. That's a relief. I'm playing catch up on literally everything anyway so running on my lonesome is fine by me.
---
It’s the way the game handles the Annex section of the Tower. Roughly below where the portal is being built is the landing pad you spawn on when you fast travel to the Annex, but because of how they have it set up, you can’t see the pad from the Bazaar and vice versa
---
And he’s not actually in a tank, just an icon in his username
---
hmmm
---
I got something like 6 or so exotic drops since shadowkeep launched and none of them was monte carlo. Ant that's the only exotic i'm still missing :(
---
How do you drive and play then?
---
[thought of this](http://e.lvme.me/vavuv35.jpg)
---
Your missing nothing no one really uses the gudied games they've been in beta form for ages now
---
Aztecross gaming on YouTube ,that’s like his thing.
---
Hunters are using it because they’re sick of OEM’s shit.
---
And I’ve seen next to zero Wormhusks. What world do you live in?
---
AWESOME. NOW HE CAN SEE YOU THROUGH SPACE AND TIME.
---
So i should just find a group on the fireteams search?
---
Did you ever play with the D1 as the supercell is the real scourge
---
The number of times I did this the other night when I spent an hour trying to get it right... I feel like I should have gotten something for my efforts and distance accomplishments. lol
---
I got it 5 seconds after spawning in to see Eris, completely unaware the minigame existed at the time.
---
holy shit you're an asshole. like, wow. you run outta tendies or what?
---
Bruh
---
So is there a Vex santa I can leave these for? I've been a good lil Vexling this year.
---
As a hunter I can corroborate this lol. A good 75% of 1 on 1 gunfights I get in, I win by using riskrunner and nightstalker dodge. So easy lol. Position next to cover and shoot until their shield breaks then dodge into cover and jump out of it while invisible then spray whatever health they have left
---
The weapon does damage to calus? shocking!
---
I shoulder charge instead. If you want to counter it use a shotgun or BACK UP and keep shooting lol. Just a small way of killing us charging titans :3. Why am I telling you? Because I’m the type of titan who doesn’t have her head up her ass and tries to make crucible fair
---
Don’t forget knee pads
---
Wtf have you brought upon this world
---
r/cursedcomments
---
The filthiest to be sure
---
Oem aint that hard to counter just hit headshots and fire first and avoid fights when the perk is activated worm husk is been used in almost every lobby ive played in btw
---
Try this: post literally anything about titans always using OEM in the Crucible.
---
I guarantee you that somebody will reply telling you that actually, they don’t,  and then go on to describe their entire Crucible build. 
---
Every. Time.
---
Yo guys it’s deji
---
Yea. Hand-held supernovas. Yea. Shoulder charge.
---
Problem is when they play corners and because of how maps are built there are too many corners i get what you saying tho
---
I watched a 4 hour video while grinding. Still don’t understand it.
---
I like how you made C-3PO  r/DestinyFashion 
---
Goes perfectly with all the GoS gear posts.
---
I think the situation will only get worse now it is a f2p game and the PC port has moved to Steam.
---
It should just play like a little bowling ball hitting pins noise.
---
Flairs check out
---
Because titans bad grrr
---
Handheld is the only good ability warlocks and not a lot of people use it (from what ive seen) shoulder charge is pretty easy to shutdown for the most part
---
Just don’t shoot them.
---
Taken ogres are more annoying that regular ogres.  -change my mind-
---
“Psst......take me with you”
---
I can get behind you on the forges part. Getting the izanami forge took forever. I don’t think anyone would want to go through unlocking those two more times.
---
Hell yeah! It’s definitely tough, but once you get the hang of it it’s not too awful.
---
NO DONT REMIND ME OF THAT
---
Hey I saw your comment on the chocolate coin and trophy page and had a hunch you might be looking for an active aus clan.
---
Our clan uses discord to communicate and play together. Feel free to pop in and say hi: 
---
https://discord.gg/CBKDCw
---
Honestly dont care if oem and bottom tree get nerfed dont use them anyways want warlocks to get buffed
---
Grats on the seal! The first one feels the greatest :D
---
Moniters haunted
---
It's a lot easier now, you don't lose a whole stack of streak from just one loss anymore. And comp gives a lot more Glory.
---
Make sure to choose the solo comp if you don't already have a team.
---
A lot more manageable. No stacks to absolutely shitstomp your face in.
---
The subconscious101 on Xbox live doesn’t play either of the destiny games, so it’s probably not them
---
How dare you say OEM is balanced
---
Anyone for a beer?
---
Daily bounty: Make 15 consecutive deliveries. Dying will reset your progress.
---
I’m not sure about D1 raids. But if you’re on pc now I can take you through GoS
---
Bounties, i guess😂
---
Why would savathun(or however you spell it) need nanites when she has space magic?
---
Also why would you want MORE d1 exotics we already have enough
---
Hive, bring a sword!
---
Awesome. Thanks so much!
---
Wait til you hit 950...
---
I have at least three exotic hand cannon quests at the moment. They all have PvP components.
---
Thanks, will look it up
---
Hammerhead doesn't need a nerf. It's not even the best legendary machine gun
---
Red is my favorite.
---
Yo watch your mouth may a vanguard hear us. But anyway good luck drifters
---
Little oops indeed.
---
I know how you feel and I'd love to help if you Dm me we can try to set something up
---
I thought his job was to point out the obvious.
---
- Crimson lore tab
---
If you stop shooting you lose
---
That’s just your internet
---
I agree it’s currently op. But give us a good exotic instead of nerfing the only good one into the ground
---
thanks my man
---
ascendant shards = golf balls
---
Hey I'm checking to see if I was shadow banned c an you please reply to this
---
Have you checked your postmaster? Whenever that's happened to me it went there cuz my inventory was full
---
It was about 20 minutes before reset (12:00 CT)
---
Just use the Colonel mask for FoTl
---
Red is always where it begins, red is a tricky mistress xD
---
Thanks ! appreciate it.
---
I kind of wanted to go the extra mile.
---
If anyone else wants to as well that's even better.  But I feel he deserves to get more than just a few things to tell people 'oh yeah this guy died too'.
---
I don't feel he got a proper sendoff he deserved.
---
Nah, just Bungie being sneaky. 
---
Head to the Broken Shore, in that higher-up area where the ether ritual public event happens and look for Toland.
---
Comp to 2100 isn't too bad this season. If you're a semi-competent PvP player you can get it this season.
---
The forges are now on a daily rotation on the bottom left of the EDZ map. Also Tuesday they are fixing the bug for the Keymold. 👽
---
Damn... High quality post. Nice. Btw. Where is my second post here? My comment history shows me this is somewhere there. Also i triggered 12 people, could be better i say for such low effort bait.
---
Always look for help? Make sure you use comms. Keep at a quest if you start it because most of the time it’s worth it?
---
Just back out of the game then back in. It should pop. If not, just wait a few minutes. I also heard doing another match of crucible works too.
---

This is common for guardians going at high speed. Tube GLs cause a bit of actual knockback when firing and traveling at high speeds (such as here to the pit in the corrupted strike) can cause hilarious physicing to happen to you
---
ELIA5: Big fast go boom boom fast
---
What. Who’s the dumbass who came up with that
---
I have that same monitor
---
Gameshare with your friends if they have ps plus then you also have it
---
I loved that gun so much
---
Get a full choke shotgun, go middle tree arcstrider, Shotgun ape + reflecting super. Should do you right
---
Fact!: the people who use OEM complained about Wormhusk when it was at its prime (it wasn’t as good as OEM is now)
---
I was kind of in the same boat as you. I played a ton y1 and then fell off the radar until shadowkeep. I got the armor set and rolls that I wanted and then used upgrade modules and duplicates to beef up what I had. Currently at 958 light. As for weapons, just pick up exotic quests and pinnacle weapons, and look out for good rolls on your more used/favorite weapons. Outlaw, kill clip, snapshot sights, etc... Basically just explore and enjoy all the content that’s available to you and your build will come together. As for my weapons I use spare rations, go figure, jade rabbit, nameless midnight, recluse, heroes burden, badlander, and erianas vow regularly.
---
Gun? Or ornament?
---
The grind starts at 900. Fortunately you have powerful drops, unfortunately rng will screw you over by making 3 of every 5 powerfuls drop for the same slot
---
Yeah its pretty trash like bungie forums.
---
Gradient
---
Ah thanks a lot! That’s very helpful :)!
---
You need to do the old nightfalls (right side of vangaurd playlist) it doesn't have matchmaking so you will need to get a group.
---
He sounds like a keeper
---
*Vex on the field*
---
Drifter no please.
---
Don't join the chats and use what you want. I don't have any of them and do just fine in pvp and pve. People suck in online games, and any game that lets you default to no text or voice chat is greatness. Use it.

After 900 you need to look for things that give a tier of 'powerful gear'. Otherwise progress will be quite slow as you're seeing
---
In place of The Recluse, I'd suggest Mob Justice.  Super nice SMG.

I choose to believe all dialogue in Russian D2 is the same audio used for Rasputin's voice.
