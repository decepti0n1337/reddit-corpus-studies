The second perk doesn't matter. As long as you've got Traction.

I'd assume so. You can't get past 600 without Forsaken.

I got one step closer to getting Challenger speedrank on raid.report! I got an 8:41 wish-wall LW time and I am sitting at #223.

Drifter 640 bounties. Get them now, yeeeesssss.

I prefer to solo the story, but thank you for the offerüòä
---
Probably service revolver
---
SR means OP "Sucks Rod"
---
NP. just do some regular activities and events and you'll reach a decent level in no time.
---
I'd argue that since the intrinsic for Polaris Lance is the perfect fifth adding an explosive solar round, the catalyst adding Firefly is just an improvement on that. So technically yes, you may be right but it's still just improving something that was already there.
---
He is accusing you for modifying damage numbers? Wtf is this minecraft or something that you can use cheat engine and give you stupid buffs.
---
Regretfully one of the most annoying NPCs are one of the useful ones
---
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET
---
There's also Whisper of the Worm's Masterwork, which gives it Box Breathing (and an even better version to boot).
---
It‚Äôs service revolver, I had kill clip active, so the ttk on it is almost as good as Luna‚Äôs/NF so I 3 tapped him, he must‚Äôve thought I one shot him and got salty
---
Nice work, I bet that was a win that had you feeling proud! :3
---
I'm playing on PC and still it feels EXACTLY like something that would have been in the first game.
---
It....was....
---
Brilliant! Got to 37, that's the furthest. Thank you, dude.
---
The salt revolver
---
Who else had to zoom in to make sure you weren't on the losing side roster?
---
: D
---
We didn‚Äôt have quitters, we loaded into the match 2v4

Well, at least Bungie made sure to give a pre-emptive measure in case someone got stuck in there
---
1-phase is not a cheese. OP just has poor ammo management
---
I've been playing a couple of months.

The only thing you really need is a warlock with well of radiance. The sub classes the rest is using doesn't really matter.
---
You get a seed of light during the strongest curse, visit the court with your offering and you'll get it when opening the chest.
---
SUCH A LUST FOR REVENGE!
---
I do not. Maybe I think too much but I always imaged those people to be like me and therefore unable to reach fabled. I suppose I just thought that 4 of me would not help my situation. But after this long I‚Äôll try anything.
---
I was gonna say looks a lot better than on xbox
---
Nice. I've given up on it, never gonna get all the EP gear which is basically all i have left to get wayfarer. Same issue with dredgen and cursebreaker. For the former, i only need a reset and the furtive shell and for the latter i need 9 more bones and 9 more eggs. If i ever get them, great. If not, evenly as great. The seals are pretty useless.
---
And 1k voices
---
Nope.
---
anything with this BPM would go well with this dance.
---
I hope he‚Äôs okay too
---
This armor looks great, and would look sweet in D2. 
---
However
---
Id wear it, but they'd have to make it a little more destiny-ish if you get what I'm saying, this kinda looks like a sweet McCree skin from overwatch
---
well have you ever played a Borderlands game?
---
play with your friends. maybe one will start a new character with you. just play through the campaigns and enjoy yourself
---
Yep i played the ever loving shit out of borderlands 2
---
Ok thank you
---
oh good so it's kind of the same. kill shit, get guns, repeat cycle.
---
Oh ok
---
yeah to destiny-fy this they‚Äôd have to make it a lot more simple looking
---
Drop mag's awful.
---
You've wasted you money... this game is all but dead and the devs have abandoned 90% of the game and refuse to listen to their community. You should of waited for Borderlands 3
---
Not your fault.
---
The objective readout said "Traverse Deeper", it didn't specify it *wasn't* talking about your teammate's orifices :O
---
Is the campaign good?
---
services: denying guardians wayfarer
---
Whisper is occasionally used by pros in PvP because of the perk mulligan. Mulligan can be found on one other sniper, but whisper has less flinch. (Plus white nail)
---
People use darci in PvP because you get 7 shots from a heavy brick. Darci also frees up space for a shotgun, or an erentil. Darci is only ever used by people who like to use snipers a lot in PvP.
---
For the stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip
---
A successful thundercrash??? Whats next I wonder - a blade barrage that doesn't ends up in "KilLeD bY aRcHiteCts"
---
This psycopath
---
I had it but once I got "nights watch" I fully master worked it and now I refuse to use any other scout.
---
Ikelos is a PvE weapon, used for boss damage. The ideal Retold Tale is an energy shotgun that has quickdraw and a ton of range.
---
The kill message gets wonky sometimes. I've been killed with an Arc damage Ikelos HC before. I was confused until someone in voice mentioned that can happen if you're taking damage from several sources.
---
Well done my friend
---
We have been playing this game for almost 6 years now and the idiots on the dev team still cant fix this, good lord.
---
Good point... I once had a look at all the emblems in the database because I was curious but I dont remember seeing that one.
---
it could go either way imo, solo queue gives you a shot at being matched with good teammates as much as being matched with leavers and the like. with 4 stacking, there's no randomness to your teammates but if you go on a losing streak with that 4 stack turning it around is difficult since everyone's tilted at that point.
---
Shards are easy to get though, Im always low on cores
---
Yeah but they look so cool though
---
Well i played d2 for like ever stuck at level 20 and couldn't even walk around with getting killed by a wanted boss "recommended 630 power" and I wouldn't be able to do more than like revive when running with 2 level 50's in verdant forest... But as soon as I payed 79.99 and spent a weak leveling up, now nothing on the game is really a challenge...
---
That's kinda pay to win dog...
---
Really, why? It seems like a Trust would be a more logical replacement, its stats are better across the board and you can keep your DRB. It just won't roll with Kill Clip.
---
You can only do 3, account wide obviously.
---
a weapon to surpass metal gear
---
You can still get them if the season ends right?
---
As someone who just got 1k, it‚Äôs fun just pointing in the other teams direction and getting the army of one. Only drawback is the charge time
---
So fuckin angry. Classic Titan attitude
---
Im not a fan . For me the gun play is where its at . But if they did like you said maybe they could tune down the super spamming in the other game modes a bit cause i think there is a bit much at the moment. I think the introduction of supermods was a bad move . Some regular matches sometimes feels like Mayhem now.
---
Does make the occasional ‚ÄúGG‚Äù message feel better though
---
Doing the reckoning tier 3 is also a good income of cores
---
It really does..
---
The campaign is just the first step. After that your main goal is to reach the max level of each expansion - you can do that by getting powerful rewards - look out for golden icons on your director map. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
When you hit the max level you can go into the story of the next expansion - finish it and reach max level again - repeat for every expansion. 
---
You can also play Strikes, Gambit and Crucible, which are basically playlists with matchmaking and cannot be "finished" in a way. 
---
The whole game is about getting better gear, in terms of perks and powerlevel. 
---
If you have any specific questions, let us know.
---
Any strategies for the massacre medals (reaper)?  I thought it was at least somewhat broken/inconsistent due to a TWAB post and my own experience... but enough ppl have reckoner that something must work.
---
Hardly talked to folks didn't have to much to saaayyyy
---
This footage was brought to you by Craig Thompson, also known as MiniLadd
---
Thanks man, i guess ill just hop on rn and see how far i can understand it again. And just try to look for those things u just said
---
Thanks for the message didn't knew there was a sub for it.
---
Thing is i am already at 2180 glory so if i join u, we would be facing actual good players at fabled rank. If u are skillful with grenade spam, u might get to fabled or if u wait till reset tomorrow, u can play the usual version instead of the mayhem lite version it is now.
---
I knew this would be here somewhere.
---
Just got it 5 days ago
---
Smh yall were just trying to have a normal convo
---
As a nightstalker Main this brings a tear to my eye
---
It‚Äôs just hilarious to think about my guardian whipping his head around then shaking his ass.
---
Rapid hit is waaaaay better than range finder for this weapon
---
He offers three specific ones a week
---
Lmao, yeah, I'm gonna get soooo many enhancement cores from all those shaders
---
The Last Word catalyst should increase stability and/or handling. Reloading the magazine with precision kills while hip firing will definitely make this gun too good in pvp. Better than it already is. It already has the fastest ttk crit and body of any primary weapon without proc'ing something prior to engagement. It's drawbacks are range, stability(while ADS) and magazine size. Of those 3, stability seems like the only one that can be increased without making the gun OP.  Of course this is just my opinion.
---
M8 you can do all three
---
Nothing unfortunately

Eververse, it‚Äôs found in the Notorious Engrams if i‚Äôm not mistaken

They changed his personality because, as cool as he seemed, all his personality really was was saying vague things. I wish they changed him to come off more as a fanatic cult follower than a fanboy

Xurs engram has show protection

Alright. Can we stop with these posts before people catch on and my secret weapon becomes common place and gets nerfed? 
---
Real talk. Weapon shreds in both pve and pvp
---
There is literally no money involved in cores, you cannot buy them with dollars, glimmer, or silver dust...
---
Having a clan mate with you is the only thing that would help, catalysts aren‚Äôt exotics
---
Shattered Throne only

How so?

He didn't cancel his Super, he canceled his melee *with* his Super.

Mayhem takes no skill it‚Äôs just a gamble for every engagement. Super fights are a coin toss

I actually like aiming down sights more than hip firing I got used to it

I‚Äôll have you know I once punched a mid super striker to death and then immediately did the verdant forest melee only and got mvp, fight me
---
‚ÄúHow to post an everyday occurrence‚Äù it‚Äôs not that cool bud congrats you can use a sleeper we‚Äôre all very proud
---
I dunno I really jive with it. Who doesn't like explosions? It's great for strikes and whatnot and I even have good luck with it on the bigger PvP maps. Have you tried it or just going off what YouTube says?
---
You mean hunters ruining everything again, like in crimson doubles?
---
Hello there!
---
Lol yeah, it was really good in Crimson days
---
I like the gun, but I hate the relief speed, so sarcastically slow.
---
*you, I like you*
---
Take up Sony Vegas, or start raw with After Effects, Learning curve is not too steep.
---
I found out about this gun not too long ago grinded for 2 days got this and service revolver
---
My uncle actually installed Sony Vegas on my PC a while back. I completely forgot about it
---
My thoughts exactly
---
 *Victory imminent.*
---
Since we're here:
---
I have one like this, and one with high caliber rounds and outlaw. I still find myself using a pulse alot of the time. :-D
---
Neither do shoulder charge titans.  I‚Äôm not saying that it was fair or balanced in the slightest.  I‚Äôm saying that it was different.  It forced people to try new things.  The meta was turned upside down for a while, and that‚Äôs a good thing.  The meta of which weapons to use in strikes or the reckoning change with the singe.  It was nice to have something different in crucible for a change.  If you were to stubborn to adapt then of course it‚Äôs going to be frustrating, but if you run around in crucible with a sword, scout rifle, and grenade launcher, and refuse to change, your gonna be just as frustrated.
---
Yeah. Nothing that simple youtube tutorial search won't fix. Good luck, Guardian.
---
r/fireteams is supposed to be a good place to find fireteams. Good luck!
---
Looks pretty horribly done, I do not like it.
---
They are. :D I gave you credit in the post.
---
Yes. I did it on xbox.
---
It's up on a ledge so you have to jump up to it. Ideally with the speed buff from completing the floor is lava chalange.
---
This gun any good and if so what roll should I look for...
---
You could literally stack up and your team could throw 8 tracking grenades in any direction blindly for guaranteed kills, or be permanently invisible, if you think shoulder charge in any way is similar to that you clearly are just completely biased and not worth anybody‚Äôs time talking to.
---
You‚Äôre a complete hypocrite, telling people to adapt to one class being so broken they can win a match without firing a gun, but ‚ÄúMuh titans can shoulder charge even though this is a shotgun meta and you can see it coming a mile away‚Äù
---
He‚Äôs a hunter main so no matter what you say he‚Äôs gonna justify Parma invisibility or grenades so OP you can win without firing a gun or even knowing where your opponent is
---
Yep, it's always a simple solution from the gamer's eyes. When it comes to the reality of programming, simple and easy solutions are a nightmare to implement and what seemed easy beforehand is now a major issue when attempted because of technical debt catching up (see extra credits video about tehnical debt).
---
Seriously, gamers think it's always an easy fix and that game devs are just too lazy to do it when in reality it's a hard fix that takes too much time and manpower to fix and instead it's better to use that same effort to fix other higher priority bugs or implementing new content.
---
Programming isn't easy, yo.
---
I believe so, because I think nightshade was a previous seasonal gun (?) and I started getting it after I had claimed that one. Sorry you dropped 1k already :(. In any case I guess it's safer to buy the vendor version first.
---
Could be like the other commenter said and he got a lucky ricochet round, or could be lag.
---
I am a Titan and I support this message.
---
When you're tethered, you share all damage with those you're tethered too. So when your teammate who is also tethered dies to that pulse rifle you die as well. That's why we use tether for GL double kills for mountaintop progress.
---
Isn't there a tether that shares damage with those who are tethered? I haven't played destiny in a while so I don't quite remember.
---
Your Ally which was closer to the guy got shot and that made it seem like he shot you through a wall.
---
it‚Äôs quite strange being the only Titan who cannot punch... it gets a little lonely too...
---
I still need to finish this...
---
You make some bad experiences for a month or two, and after that you just can't enjoy an entire game mode anymore.
---
So, if you can flick easier and the movement is faster, then why add the bullet magnetism and aim assist? PC shooters should not have aim assist.
---
Ha Jokes On You I Have All Of The Exotics Plus All The Ornaments, Plus All Of Them Equipped At The Same Time
---
Interesting.  I had an easier time finishing that with Malfeasance than Crimson.

#LOUD PUNCHING
---
(*The Titans welcome you as warmly has our Sunbreaker brothers‚Äô Hallowfire heart. Whether you choose to stay with us and honor our codes is up to you, all we ask for is that you punch proudly and T-Bag Warlocks who shun us for our forbidden knowledge of punching. We hope you learn to embrace the way of punching and use its power wisely*)
---
Also Luna‚Äôs.   The weapon about to be nerf‚Äôd
---
The highest mote wagered is based on character, not account. The synthesiser is in the pursuit section, locked to each character. Not sure about curated guns and tiers to get them.
---
A fix to that can go back to D1 raids where encounters had a loot table.
---
Example: in Kings Fall, the class items only dropped from the final encounter with Oryx.
---
Therefore, if you want to farm the easiest encounter, you only have access to specific items in that encounter loot table. 
---
Encounter farming would only work with Last Wish since thats the only raid you can easily warp to specific encounters.
---
I feel like this would fit better on r/destinyfashion
---
I discovered its potential in the Eater of Worlds of all places. That beast tore through the adds during Argos phase 1. Still one of my go-to's.
---
I don't know which game you are playing but Gambit is far from dead and never was close.
---
&gt; Why do people still use Hammerhead instead of this gem?
---
Range and stability.  You can use the Hammerhead almost like a scout rifle with the right perks.
---
I have all but not forgotton now ( don't want it either. ) and i must say. Some are great fun ( recluse and this one and dilirium) the rest are kinda....meh
---
Personally I think it‚Äôs a fun game. My suggestion would be play some of the base game and decide if you like the gunplay, and mechanics of the game. If you do, I recommend buying the DLC‚Äôs and such. Right now is a nice time to really power level a character up to max light because there‚Äôs no more content coming for another month so you can catch yourself up
---
Heck yeah. Just do literally every single daily and weekly bounty on all three characters and you'll be perfectly fine. Probably don't even need to win as long as you do bounties.
---
c a y d e  
---
n o
---
I did 2 resets in April with no extra XP week and I usually only play a couple nights maybe 3 a week.  Do all bounties on 3 characters....if you have Prime I hear its even easier.  Its a lot of Gambit but if you want it done before season you might need to hit hard core....the more you can in the next week the better.

Why are you playing Destiny if you don‚Äôt have forskin?
---
This made me delete my 2nd hunter to make a Titan
---
I just really like Destiny. I've been playing since before the Dark Below. Plus, it's kinda funny seeing people get angry in comp when Im on their team
---
I‚Äôve been playing this tree with two a swashbuckler/grave robber last man standing and a kinetic sniper with the dragons shadow and it‚Äôs the most fun I‚Äôve ever had
---
You smacked what upside the head?
---
Pretty much this. I'd say one in 7-8 runs drops it. Allthough I've had lucky runs of rng where I got 5 curated weapons in 2,5h. (Prism w/ 1kv team on oryx so we were plowing through real quick)
---
Yes

Can anyone tell me what the FUCK this logo actually is or measn or what it refers too?

If I still have it around that many years from now, maybe, lol

Be careful. Thems fightin' words to some.

---
It's nice to be able to be one punch man now.
---
yah i am a spectral main you have a problem?
---
Ehhhh
---
Bullet magnetism doesn't actively help you aim, it just makes the target (a tiny bit) larger. You'd still miss if your aim was off by a significant margin. 
---
I mean if you really want to get into phrasing, it does *assist your aiming*.
---
Damnit primal i already took it down
---
Would Borealis be any good in the fight? It's the best exotic sniper I have, totally not considering the DARCI...

I assume he meant Toaster

That's the joke dumbass
