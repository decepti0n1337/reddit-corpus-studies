Then I should have gotten it the 5th time when I killed enkaar finally on the third draw. Problem was this bug didn’t count it and I died at the same time that I killed him.
---
---
---
All you need is to subscribe to Gambit Prime.
---
Well we did the same thing when we went against Zavala, didn't we? We ignored Vanguard command to go kill Uldren
---
This loadout is the one I usually use and you may like it who knows.
---
In my primary slot I usually end up going with breakneck for that sweet add clear
---
Telesto in my secondary as it just absolutely shreds and because of its perk harbingers pulse whenever you get multi kills you get ammo from your reserves and mixed with the tier 2 reaper set (multi kills grant special ammo) you would practically never have to reload.
---
And in my heavy slot I would usually go for an omg for both damage and add clear (so either hammerhead or 21% delirium if you have it.Use 21% delirium if you prefer more add clear tho.Hope this helps.
---
Also I put tried to on here due to its 30% damage increase in pve so yh
---
Praxic Finery. No comment necessary
---
Wow. A message screenshot that doesn't expose OP for being a toxic piece of shit. That's a first
---
Plus the double knife charge
---
How did you get to fabled so fast? I’m just starting luna’s quest and I’m not looking forward to it
---
Honestly you can get it within a day if you're willing to sit though about 20 solo Nightfalls which can take around 15 minutes each since Will of the Thousands is comparatively short
---

---
If you use something like a bow, preferably masterworked too you get the precision kills and orbs in the process of those NFs and a regular Will of the Thousands has like 200-300 enemies to kill so yeah
---
no problem!
---
Yeah um your gay
---
It has dragonfly and then a perk that says the more critical hits before the enemy dies the bigger the dragonfly explosion is. 
---
I imagine this has a cap but it would be so amazing to put all the bullets into a raid boss and then watch it blow up like a nuke.
---
I mad because if I try to say that on Xbox I’ll get com banned for like 2 days or something.
---
oof I'm not really triggered cause everyone is allowed to have an opinion, but I don't know how others are gonna react to this
---
One Thousand Wings is probably the closest thing we can get to that thus far
---
Which is mostly why I haven't used anything else since I've gotten it
---
rather than it being Vanguard vs drifter, it's actually more like Praxic order vs drifter because the vanguard are allowing drifter to be in the tower running gambit in order to find the guardians who are tempted too much by the darkness.
---
They're acting neutral about it, but they're letting it stay. Cayde even says in one of his caches during the Ace in the hole mission that he "had the idea first" and that the drifter "could never pull it off". Cayde even ran with the drifter and his crew at some point (from the same dialogue actually). 
---
So really, it's praxic order vs Drifter, with the vanguard being in the middle, leaning the tiniest bit towards the drifter side. 
---
I’m replaying it on my warlock and that hit hard after the third time. :(
---
I believe it is now on sale as well. 
---
Siding with drifter because Zavala was too much of a b***h to help avenge Cayde.
---
[CoolGuy crucible tips video](https://youtu.be/74e3mByi0d0)  this guys YouTube videos helped me a lot in improving. He puts out some great content. Hope it helps you too. 
---
Dang... Thanks anyways!
---
^
---
Thank you so much! Is the annual pass needed yet? Or is that for content yet to come? 
---
Me too! I still think killing Cayde off was simply...unnecessary.
---
We got us that ace bond.
---
I jumped ship after the first few months of vanilla and came back during black armory and honestly I fell in love with the game again
---
When u live in New Zealand and the reset is 18 hours later
---
Yep I remember Cayde's dialogue - I just figured that was him kinda piling on his persona (there's a lore entry that mentions he's being so ridiculous because he's literally that traumatised from the Red War) for the sake of keeping up appearances. Since the Guardian got involved with Gambit independently of Cayde *and* while he might like them, they don't know all the Vanguard's secrets, so it'd make sense he wouldn't be 100% upfront about why he's involved.
---
I definitely agree that the Praxic Order is the main opposition for the Drifter/Gambit, but I always got the impression Cayde and Shaxx would intervene if they thought the Drifter was going too far with Gambit. And it's a helluva lot easier to do that if the Vanguard have people involved with it - and I don't doubt the Drifter realised that too, tbh.
---
We're in the second season but get to the end of forsaken and judge wether you want more it's what I did and I'm really happy with my decision
---
The annual pass is very good for a committed player.  I would recommend getting forsaken to start and when you finish campaign and get into endgame decide. The annual pass content will always be available and is not very story based. 
---
Are you on PlayStation?
---
I hope you enjoy. 
---
r/enlightenedcentrism
---
On Xbox its especially easy since you can simply hit "upload to One Drive" or download it via the Xbox app on both PC and Mobile
---
I got 20k ace kills. Back in S4 , any forsaken exotic with out a catalyst could get a tracker through the app
---
was levelling my second character today and did the "invitation from the emperor" adventure on nessus. Cayde was the first voice I heard.
---
*"Hey you two!"* I nearly cried.
---
At one point near the end he yelled for Ikora too and I was just like,, man don't break my heart like this.
---
yes oh god yes. would give me something else to watch waiting for the next season to become free to watch
---
Strike Boss Social Support Group
---
 
---
Nothing special, it’s just one of the bosses
---
Drifter, because Zavala has been inconsistent af in the past and never seems to align with our guardian's thought process, and the rest of the vanguard pretty much follow suit.
---
I always wear his bond where ever I go so he can see all the places he didn’t get to see while stuck in the tower.
---
Now, I’m gonna be honest with you here, I don’t play Destiny atm anymore for some reasons, but I was very good at PvP. I was Top 500 in trials in D1 and I got 40 kills a game with a controller on PC D2. I used to be very bad, and what made me improve really quickly was watching good players. The main thing that makes a player good in PvP modes is the flow of your movement. The best players waste no movements, everything is deliberate. Try to copy how those players rotate, shoot, and use their abilities. Once you can mimic the best players well, adapt your play-style to how you want to be. The thing that works the most for me is aggression. Get in the other players head and rush the path they least likely expect. Most people sit back and wait, and when you rush you can often get the first shot if you have good gun skill. Don’t let people relax and take a breath, you can trick people into thinking you are much better by overwhelming them before they can adapt to your speed. 
---
I’m sorry if that was confusing, but that’s what works for me. #1 thing is guns kill, #2 is movement and fluidity, #3 is rotation and being in the right place. Work on your shot and tweak your setting until you can aim anywhere on the screen with a quick snap.
---
Good luck!
---
The Vex want to know your location 
---
Found the titan
---
The ability to speak doesn't make you intelligent
---
So I've slowed down my playstyle and its slowly starting to help. I was playing waaaaaayyyyyy too aggressively, especially since I'm a noob lol
---
*ahem* seeded...not seated. Also you chose the template with the mouse cursor on it.
---
That out of the way, I prefer Drifter because I relate to his personality more than I ever could with Zavala. Cayde-6 passed away, and so did my reason to side with the Vanguard.
---
It only drops from adventures, not story missions! You have to wait for the Tangled Shore to be flashpoint to replay adventures. The first heroic (replayed) adventure you do per character per day has the highest chance to drop it. 
---
This is the flashpoint order: 
---
EDZ
---
Nessus
---
Tangled Shore
---
Io
---
Mercury
---
Titan
---
Mars
---
Vanguard. While i am fed up and tired of the Vanguard, they're still on the Traveler's and Humanity's side. And i am a stalwart believer of the Traveler. 
---
The Drifter is shady as fuck. Not to mention i just learned he can create his own Taken, and that's an instant no for me.
---
Damn didn't realize I never finished my thought.  I was going to say uninstall all your GPU drivers completely and install the latest ones.  
---
But look into what MOBO dates you can do.
---
Fuuuuuuuuuuck I love shaxxs helmet I wish I got it soo bad dude
---
What if I make a second hunter grind to forsaken and kill all the barons. Will that give me a chance cause 4 weeks is a wait for a chestpeice
---
Ask yourself did you throw enough grenades. DID YOU?
---
You can find a lot of  guides showing how to get it. [Here is one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7TsLMQ7sW4&amp;). Like the other person said, you can't start the quest until Tuesday. Shattered Throne is only available on the third week of  the Dreaming City's three week cycle.

---
Thanks for the correction realized that when I got on Xbox earlier and was too lazy to fix it
---
Nah, I'm barely pushing 655. Weekly rewards are bugged. 
---
Didnt use it the first time round in D1, never much cared for pvp, and it was next to useless in pve. Never even got it
---
Guardians died, Drifter didn’t kill them. He may be cold hearted but that doesn’t make him evil. 
---
Titan void shield + warlock rift did it for me and my clan today
---
Same, my friends hate and love me at the same time now in PvP. Somehow my hunter got to a higher level faster than my Titan main
---
TW seems lame until you see the body shot damage you can do with it. It's easy to farm a decent roll but most will get the job done regardless.
---
I didn't even notice that till now 😂
---
Yeah, like I said, I get the "we aren't an army thing."
---
My issue with him is how little effort he put in during the attack to retake the city, when the others went all out. Literally the only thing he did was -cautiously- approach a soldier, try to take their weapon, got thrown to the ground and then walked away looking like he was about to cry. Meanwhile, Cayde is assassinating everyone, Ikora is flying top speed on a bike leading the charge, and even Hawthorne is shooting people. Zavala does NOTHING. I'm not debating his moral obligations, I'm just completely unimpressed at his lack of initiative.
---
it was so perfect you were seconds to slow to use your super and get one back at the same time...RIP
---
Awesome! I've just hit 50 found a few before I capped. All good information to know. Thank you!
---
# F
---
Thanks for this. I'll check him out!
---
Thanks for tip on how to drop it. HVT hunting until I see it. 
---
How do you farm it?
---
Lol in all honesty, I found it kinda meh on console. Has a ton of recoil even with counterbalance, wish it had Zen Moment instead of feeding frenzy
---
I personally prefer Hunter.
---
Wow this is SUPER helpful! Thanks so much! 
---
That’s disgusting... I love it!
---
Yes
---
I will buy a bundle just for this. Dragons Breath was my first ever exotic.
---
Are you sure *we* miss it? I would to have it back for nostalgia since it was my first ever exotic. But everybody made fun of me for using it.
---
IDENTITY THEFT IS NOT A JOKE /u/DasGuppy MILLIONS OF FAMILIES SUFFER EVERY YEAR!
---
His point is that there's little purpose to trying to actually grind out armor outside of tier 3 since the only powerful armor piece you get is from the weekly and you'll end up replacing the whole T1 set the moment you have a T3 set.
---
fuck the drifter vanguard all the way 
---
Idk bro... I’m siding with Vanguard on this one. The gambit prime primeval curb stomp damage is high enough that I feel like we should be suspicious 
---
go crazy ahhh go stupid
---
I hope you have better RNGesus than me then!
---
Any tips to get to Fabled? I soloed comp today and realized it would be impossible for me to get to fabled in a season. Decay and reducing ranks after losses seems crazy

You want to talk about this? :(

Hey guys, I found the guy who got destroyed by Luna's one to many times.

You keep searching for a team/help. If you respond and even make such posts — he got you.

Don't let such people affect you. By merely replying to them you become a troll food. Don't do that.

I play comp lmao ace has enough recoil to hit you in the face and last word is only really good from hipfire. If you think lunas sucks I believe that just reflects more on tje user. And if you are using hand cannons for range thats on you lmao 
---
He had some really good points in the past but with this video he missed the mark.
---
Are you a little touched? You seem like all the wheels aren't quite turning right upstairs. 
---
actually, i'm the guy who has Luna's Howl and wish they were using a blue pulse rifle instead.
---
and it's not for lack of use, either. 70% of comp kills for the questline.
---
and yet, here I am, wishing for my sweet baby blue.

Either have a way to separate them or disallow anything but solo for Gambit prime unless its a custom match

Warlocks using chaos reach on primeval with 0 stacks

ARGH

NAH, let's just shoot paper from our guns with zero stacks. Prime primevals should not be that hard, right? DREDGENS!

Now thats epic!

Nice rune 2h

Just noticaed this as well after I responded to him for an hour lmao. Guess I wasted some time. 
---
It's very easy to take a screenshot on xbox, like press 2 buttons 
---
You can then use laptop, tablet, pc, smartphone (or other device) to upload said image from your xbox live account to imgur 
---
Never use the companion app for LFG. Use the LFG Discord if you're on PC, great community there.
---
I think they were going to change the reset time to keep it at 18:00 CEST
---
Hadn't considered bubble Titan I may try that I've gone between top tree Titan(solar)with synthoceps and melting point as well as bottom tree with the same and bottom tree Arc Titan with synthoceps you can absolutely wreck all of the ads that spawn doesn't do me much good when you get to the boss though
---
Yep.
---
Oh the irony of OP's post title. 
---
Are you new here?
---
Stop replying to yourself and just **edit your comment**.
---
They are just achievements
---
She had her suspicions, but once she realized that you made all your efforts to save Cayde, she trusts us more than the Vanguard to find dirt on the Drifter and wipe him out.
---
The Praxic Order for what it is, is like the Secret Service of the City. or even the CIA/FBI. They're incredibly thorough and can see that the Vanguard is doing nothing about the Drifter or Gambit.
---
I just don't like how skinny the arms and legs are. Otherwise it looks okay
---
I have a minor spec on mine for ad clearing but what does a Rampage spec do? And do you get them from Banshee?
---
It’s for clout. Much like your gamer score on Xbox live or trophy level on PSN (that’s a thing, right?)
---
Of any primary\*, but yes, I agree with you dirtyderson.
---
Rampage spec comes from Ada-1 and it increases time on rampage
---
An outlaw scout with an auto loading retold tale and a rampage hammerhead 
---
It's optimal ttk is faster than that of LW, because lunas can two tap people.
---
Oh is it by a lot? Sounds pretty nice to have actually.

Looks like he got a stick up his ass and has to stand straight

Yeh me neither, until i headshot a titan during hammers and was like ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

Not the sub I expected

Im still using a god roll Badlander and love it

Ah, this makes more sense then. You don't have the main quest associated with that key. I guess you get the Bergusia one whether you have the main quest or not.

Looks like Lifeline from apex
---
current armor from eververse?  what armor is it?  I havent looked there in so long...
---
Racist
---
obsidian radiance, its just a damage buff during forges 
---
Oh ok thanks man
---
The part around the biceps yes, but the these spikes on the shoulders make them look broader than a Hunter or Warlock. In that regard the Prodigal Set is kinda ok since some other sets make it look like my Titan is wearing motorcycle helmets on her shoulders.
---
:(
---
Its cause naruto and cayde ate all the ramen.

I also main a warlock, but there's a special place in my heart for punchy time. Nothing else cuts it.

I like to just use the *play dead* emote when I know theres nothing I can do to save myself.

Id say titan even though i main a hunter since hunter is more precise and less forgiving than titan.
---
3 words. Fuck. You. Zavala
---
With the recent buff to Outlaw Golden Gun, I've been loving being a gunslinger. You can wipe out whole rooms of enemies with a single super or just melt a boss. 
---
I wonder how free-to-play dev made money. I wonder how Riot games make so much money from their free to play game that isn't that good. I wonder why RotTR cost $60 same price as D2 with forsaken not even a complete edition no annual pass and still has more content and greator quality. I wonder why the Wicther 3 that is such a fantastic game cost only $49.99 for everything on steam base game starting at $39 same price as annual pass. I'd blame Activion and I think D2 is overpricing.
---
You left out the bungie reply, "first time?" 
---
Warlock with kamehameha (chaos reach) for melting primeval, Blast Furnace or Horror Story (working towards Breakneck) for adds, Jotunn and Hammerhead for everything else.
---
I typically don't invade much, so this is mostly a defensive loadout; Jotunn is for shutting down invaders and heavies, and Hammerhead is for mopping up whatever else. At some point when I move along the Malfeasance quest I'll probably revisit the loadout, because it's not ideal for invading. 
---
The one time in Stormcaller history that they make a close return to the infamy of D1. That was incredible!

I'm not afraid of Shin, I'd be happy to go up against him if need be. I'm choosing vanguard because I don't particularly like the Drifter, and I think he's kinda shady.
---
it might not be benedict 99-40, he had a leviathan badge on the top of his head, this one doesn't. also redjacks are what shaxx call his crucible frames, benedict and sweeperbot are both maintenance frames, benedict being a hacked one.
---
Yeah I'm talking about the actual arms, like the biceps and stuff. I hate big shoulder pads as much as the next guy
---
Yeah I noticed the same.  I somehow feel surrounded might only be good on a SG or maybe SMG, but probably all on your play style
---
As long as the core gameplay stays good people will still be playing. Though I’ll admit I’m in a bit a the minority as I only play with my SO and maybe once a week and the game is still pretty good
---
It only increases the time by 1 second.
---
I’ve killed more bosses than opening the chest it’s just my luck with this destinys rng
---
People will be more likely to find you attractive the higher that number is. 
---
Lol two of them are in my clan XD what are the chances
---
That’s real surprising then
---
I’m a invader 
---
Jeez man
---
I actually very much dislike pvp and never played it aside from getting thorn, and other quests. Everyone I have talked to personally says that the Thorn is less broken than everyone made it out to be. I am absolutely a casual when it comes to pvp I'm not that good at it and getting thorn was a week long struggle that I went through because the gun looked cool. It was not fundamentally the best gun in the game. There were so many guns that had faster TTK. Final Round Efrideets was insane but it was fixed, that is something that was a problem. It could reliably one shot with any sort of challenge. So many fantastic and fun weapons were ruined because of people that complained without taking a moment and thinking. This game could be light years better if people were more critical and less crying for nerfs. Nerfs are what brought us early D2 weapon system in an attempt to make it work for everyone. Coming from someone who has like .2 KD in anything pvp Thorn, shotguns, TLW, never needed to be nerfed. Balancing a game like this is impossible with the variety of weapons and player skill levels which leads to metas. No one complained about thorn till the auto rifle nerfs that put handcannons in the spotlight. 
---
I’m not a lore reader, (probably should get on that) but the reason I’m leaning more towards drifter is when Cayde died Zavala was all like nah, ain’t gunna avenge him. Where’s the loyalty! 
---
Not positive but I think the reset doesn’t happen until 1 EST on tuesdays . 
---
I’m definitely shocked that you’re ok with the way gamers act towards developers. You’re disgusting.
---
Don't use that set if you don't like it. Don't steal my HIGH SPEED LOW DRAG sets
---
Any thing with a skull at the end of the health bar or just a yellow health bar
---
ah yes my mistake, let me grab my screenshots of me with 20 motes smh
---
Antaeus Wards, Titan exotic boots.  When you slide you can reflect projectiles and gain super energy; nothing better than killing a guardian with their own wardcliffe.
---
Ohhh those ones. Totally forgot about those. Yeah no those are total re-skins. I mean painting it black and putting a AN/PEQ that shows red LED's everytime you fire seems pretty lazy tbh.
---
Kinda like burning maul. You hear the gong or whatever instrument that makes the noise and just nope the hell outta there.
---
Don’t majors have yellow health bars too?
---
Weekly reset isn't until another 35min from this post.
---
If it makes you feel any better, I was 14 when D2 came out, and it still feels it was Yesterday. I have no idea where 2018 went.
---
This could have been one of the greatest moments in Destiny. It was such an awesome concept with a beautiful environment that went all too quickly. I wish this could come back as a strike with a harder challenge, or at least higher LL requirement. 
---
Same. It patched but didn't reset
---
r/notreallyawoosh
---
It's Tuesday, you should be in class.
---
I need the ship 😫
---
Guys it’s daylight savings time. Bungie announced that resets will happen at 10am pacific now
---
Understandable
---
Cuff me boys
---
Yeah I totally agree. I was just thinking about solo queuing and that the score system don't make people who are new to gambit prime or don't play so much to focus on nothing but getting motes.  I would whish the scoreboard, the place a blueberry thinks is most important to be on topp of don't encourage people to work together. 
---
Did we forget about 69 ll? 420?
---
Daylight savings changed it from 12pm eastern to 1pm eastern.
---
Yes it is! And you can put a mod on it. And re-roll the stats. The year 2 perks aren’t that impactful on Chests so I’m going for style over utility 
---
Haven’t dropped the ship :/
---
Love it when shaxx screams. 
---
I figured boss = yellow bar, but apparently that's not the case: [https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/9o23y1/whats\_the\_difference\_between\_minor\_major\_and\_boss/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/9o23y1/whats_the_difference_between_minor_major_and_boss/)
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
If you scroll down, it would appear that boss = Ultra, and ultra is any enemy with the skull (raid) symbol near them (story missions, raids, etc.).
---
So major spec will give you much more utility in *normal* content.
---
Majors are orange bars I think or I’m just color blind
---
How do  i start it 
---
I'm such a ditz. Lack of sleep. Thank you!
---
Whiteknights just love coming out of the woodwork, don't they?
---
Look pal, if someone gives banter out, they have to expect it back regardless of what they have in their pants.
---
I'd wager she doesn't need anyone rushing to her defence over some jokes on a pseudo-anonymous message board...
---
Vanguard too. Another companion had the same issue but he just went to the orbit and back and apparently worked
---
My man
---
spoiler?!
---
Guess I'll try back in a few hours maybe then...
---
No, I’m doing it right now I’ll update the post if it works after.
---
That’s a shame
---
ОК, really off-topic but how do you actually re-roll exotics? I think they can drop with different rolls than the ones you already have but re-claiming them from your collection does not actually re-roll them, right?
---
Same:/
---
How many Nightfalls does it take?? 
---
There actually is. Take the teleporter up to the top and walk all the way back to the hidden camp. Then check the camp fire at the front left.
---
yes
---
Yes. They said as such in the twab last week 
---
How do you get there?
---
Thank you ma dude
---
Did they buff stormcaller??? Honestly haven't touched my warlock main since I got all the forsaken gear for it. Might need to play with stormcaller again since Nova warps sucks ass now. 
---
You are correct. Vanguard is just too boring.
---
Looks like part of the Farm? Unsure
---
 Come, join the dark side, and together we can rule the galaxy as Drifter and Co
---
What campfire? I literally messed around so long trying to find it that I actually managed to climb above the blocked of cave and jump behind it only to glitch out. 
---
I accepted the quest , but my bounty screen was full.... I appear to be currently fucked lol
---
Well at least you had the quest show up. That's a plus.
---
General Kenobi! 
---
Not buffed, but very fun to play, I don't use spiky helmet that goes with it, just reload gloves
---
I sided with the Drifter but I didn't get the next quest step. What do I do??
---
Google
---
I think you may have just used up the rest of your luck for all of eternity...
---
Traveler is little beach who love to use others. Dont see even 1 reason to be with vanguard.  
---
If i can choice i want to be with Vex or Hive.
---
You made the choice to help him. Man up. 
---
Lmao wait until you advance the quest 
---
I’m gonna use the evil to kill more stuff
---
The camp is behind the blocked off elevator. There’s a few wood pieces that are the campfire.
---
Yeah I can’t either 
---
I did could not find anything though.It was just a bunch of sites saying theories about were it would be.
---
#OptimalDPS
---
These are amazingly helpful, thank you so much! Even for someone who has forsaken but not the annual pass
---
Just found it. I don’t have any prompt for the thorn quest though. 
---
Look for an article written in theast few hours. 
---
ya exact same thing here im pissed 
---
Sort this subreddit by new. There is a video close to the top.
---
whatever you do dont dimsmatle the thing because i did and now i cant get it back from him
---
That isnt the thorn quest. That alligence quest XD
---
Why the hell would you join the chat? That's just asking for BS.
---
Salt mines is where you get the thorn quest 
---
What The fuck is the difference?
---
I'm joining the Vanguard because I hate Gambit
---
Thank you 
---
Im well aware that Shin is dumb enough to think he can control the dark even though we have evidence he can't. 
---
Yeah, that worked for me
---
U/Inpacy has a video up
---
Yeah, same thing here
---
One quest gets you Thorn, the other separate quest does not.
---
I would have loved HC a lot more in D1 if I had ever gotten Fatebringer, but alas I was a Vision of Confluence guy as well.
---
Judgy jerk.
---
This sub continues to produce the lowest quality memes this side of the 9 year old gap on the internet.
---
Aint working for me as well smh they could at least make sure it works before releasing it 
---
Really?  Well dang, I must have some of the worst RNG in Prime in the world :(  Feelsbadman...I want to go thinking it was only front Weekly and Reckoning :( 
---
It's true 
---
So you either want to be a mass murdering person with a bug for brains or a pile of liquid that wants to make everything dark and cubic.
---
I’m pretty sure “The Corrupted” doesn’t actually exist as a nightfall anymore.. 
---
Yeah, my inventory was full when I accepted, and there's no way to get it now....  I hoped it would be in his inventory like other bounties, but nope.
---
thanks!
---
You can pull fixed rolls from the collection, but most of them aren’t that great. Rerolling is a mechanic that stayed behind in D1, in D2 you have to hope for a better drop or you buy them from Xur, who sells decently rolled them exotics (special ammo/lmg/hc etc.). 
---
Good to know. I tweeted out to everyone I could think of, so we shall wait and see.
---
thanks so much!!
---
Do nightfalls! Each one counts as 5 strikes.
---
Unrelated to gambit curated weapons, but I have 3 Jotunns, 2 Le Monarques and have only gotten ONE curated forge weapon, total. So I think RNG just doesn't like to give some of us curated rolls.
---
How are people getting these so fast?! 
---
You can't actually re-roll then yourself. If it's a world drop then it's randomly rolled as you said. Xur has randomly rolled exotics too but you can't keep buying the same piece, it'll be the same random roll, and finally collections are exactly as you said, but there's only 1 roll on it and it's usually bad.
---
Choose the vanguard, cause few else will
---
right now dumbo
---
Same that's why I'm here :(. It sucks to carry a team and not even get rewarded :(
---
I hate it too, because it's not funny. 
---
I did that.
---
When i go to titan, the adventure isnr there at all
---
My main is all about drifter baby! But, my warlock is likely going vanguard. Hunter not sure yet if I even find time to...
---
Did you talk to the drifter? That's who you go to talk about your alliance choice.
---
Another week without Hammerhead, and another week without Lake of Shadows.
---
I just wanna run an all grenade launcher loadout and get another hammerhead since the last one I could roll was back when I was barely even the LL to do Volundr.
---
Yeah that’s what I’ve been getting from the lore leading up to today. The Vanguard is condoning Drifter’s stuff because they know that, in a way, it’s necessary. The guardians that were perma-killed in Gambit werent killed by other guardians, so those deaths could’ve happened anywhere. It’s not like Drifter is tryin to eliminate us. He needs us.
---
It isn’t marked you just do sirens song smh
---
I have had nothing from him yet. Is it because i have done the last word quest?
---
Okay Ada’s frames are not cool. We haven’t had the MG for two months now.
---
You can get 2 ballistics logs each week in order to make powerful weapons, so there's no point in saving ballistics logs unless you don't think you'll have time to get the next week's ballistics logs. 
---
I thought so but the quest won't show up 4 me
---
Gg fellow baker
---
I dont mean to sound so condescending, i just really cant justify helping the vanguard (which is a roundabout way of supporting Shin) when their logic is so faulty 
---
I dont have sirens song is what im saying
---
r/OP_irl
---
so that's y I asked
---
I'm not sure if people know this but Jotünn two shots the envoys. And actually, one shot will bring it to 1/3 health and you can pick at them with your primary. Fusion rifle reserves + scavenger and you'll never run out of special ammo. 
---
Thanky ou so much, I was losing my mind trying to figure out how to get it started
---
HELP ME SOMEONE PLEASE I HAVE NO CLUE
---
It worked for me I did it in Gambit Prime
---
Hey, no problem, glad it helped. Good luck with the quest!
---
EDIT: I tried gambit prime afterwards and it started counting towards the bounty progress
---
The last word shouldn't have anything to do with it. The drifter is supposed to be blinking so you know to go talk to him.
---
It's over Anakin
---
Still siding with Drifty boi, but nice poster! 
---
Son of a bitch
---
To this day I still do not know what porn this clip comes from.
---
Some of us have helmet but not all. Probably we should work on this.
---
Use 2 snipers sounds cool to fight against boss shields.
---
Thanks!
---
update your game, it's out already 
---
I havent had anything. I dont know if i picked a sided yet! i dont know how im suppose to check!
---
100 points/ 15 points per nightfall
---
Yeah it seems to only count the motes if you play prime 
---
 i appreciate it 
---
I did that's what's confusing me
---
Pains me to see people dismantle curated hand cannon and scout rifle. Those are deity rolls to me.
---
Already stuck on the prime research portion of the vanguard quest... motes aren’t counting, thanks vanguard
---
Most energy shotguns do as well if you hit your shots.
---
I haven’t seen em, can you link them
---
For the allegiance quest, I am unable to start the terminl after planting the bugs in the annex...any help would be appreciated
---
Nighthawk helmet is so OP! I think we need to adapt to new changes, all people is saying the same regard Whisper :-/
---
You have to complete it to get the quest? That really puckers my butthole, I haven’t been able to find a good enough team to get through it.
---
Yeah me too. 
---
May it be possible that we dont get the quest because we do not have completed the gambit Prime quest? I have not completed it and i dont get the new quest. 
---
Horrors least is but a dream. 
---
You can shoot across the map with Jotünn... Just saying. 
---
The praxic stuff dose look very cool....
---
How did anyone ever find this? Atleast how did they find it so fast.
---
We've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars
---
I look at it this way, The drifters claim is that the darkness is just a tool to be used and someone with the right will can tame it.
---
No one has ever demonstrated this is actually possible though. [When Shin was in the crucible as Zyre Orsa it was stated that in Supremacy games he'd ignore the objective and just go kill crazy](https://www.destinypedia.com/Grimoire:Activities/Crucible_Arenas#Ghost_Fragment:_Timekeeper), and this is the guy saying the darkness is just a tool to accomplish an objective. He can't even control himself in a game and we're supposed to bet the species on his plan? 
---
It doesn't matter to me how the vanguard feel, the Drifter just seems to be wrong. 
---
I am manning up.  I agreed to help him collect motes in exchange of playing his fun game. Hell I even agreed to help him find out what happened to his friend, in exchange of a weapon. As far as I'm concerned, everything is paid for and done. I am manning up by refusing to cross the line, and taking the responsibility of my actions by myself, not depending on a guy who keeps saying "Trust me"
---
Yeah, I got rid of the auto rifle, which was painful enough. I really want the hand cannon.
---
Same thing with me re downloading everything see if that will fix it.
---
No!?
---
Those phases exist? /s
---
I didnt get the mission either which is what more than likely happend to you to. Im currently redownloading everything to see if it fixes it.
---
Did you do gambit prime on the character that you are doing your alliance with? I saw another post saying the you have to do gambit prime to activate the option.
---
You kidding me? I realized the other day that D1 beta was in 2014...... I still remember cycling that one spot in the cosmodrome with two knights
---
Go see drifter
---
Totally.
---
I did
---
I think my game might be glitching
---
Its good to know that someone else is in the same boat. Tell me if you fix it
---
If they made it more like an oryx esque boss battle where you actually faught him while ads were spawning, that would have been cooler. Then a separate phase when he was close to dieing.
---
It was still decent fight at least.
---
Yeah im at about 40% right now probably finish in the next 30min.
---
Wait did you choose the drifter? Or is this right before?
---
Thirded 
---
Don't worry I did this also :( Been here grinding for something that wasn't even thorn quest Kappa
---
Drifter's got some DSLs
---
Is it any good?
---
The DC Ship comes from Morgeth, the sparrow from the weekly mission. 
---
my hunter will side with drifter- swayed by the possible powerful rewards
---
My titan will stay with the vanguard- he has a strong moral compass and doesn't trust the drifter.
---
My warlock will probably go drifter-she wants to know more about this mysterious figure
---
What's it for? 
---
Wish I had it... :(
---
For those wondering, each Warlock/Titan/Hunter kill in crucible gives 3 items out of the 50 you need per step
---
🖕
---
Because I hadn’t done the regular version of the Sirens Song adventure, so the heroic version didn’t become available when I got to that part of the quest. I thought I could pick it back up, but I guess not
---
And it costs 20 exotic engrams?  
---
Dafug?
---
On the plus side, there's a BA weapon for each slot, so if you have that one gun with a drastically lower power level that is bringing down your average you can pick a powerful BA frame for that slot. 
---
I'm going Drifter, his figure looks like Nezarec's.
---
Also, Zavala is the old light, Drifter is the new imho
---
Is it propaganda if the Vanguard is objectively correct??
---
The efficiency and defense of heavy guard feels awesome, and when I use it with Arc Singe and Heavyweight it has better DPS than Thunderlord with the same modifiers
---
Yeaaaah... the big one itself isn't so much a threat by itself, depending on how far it's launched from, but when it splits those little ones have pretty good tracking. The Skull gives super energy back on kills so you get it back even faster.
---
At first I was unsure about it, but the song does very well with the video. Nice edit\~!
---
What anime is this?
---
It is good I know, but I'd honestly prefer AP rounds/quickdraw/rampage for my purposes of using it as a group clear-er and major slayer since I don't own Thunderlord. I don't really like Surrounded since it seems like you need to have 3 enemies practically in melee range of you and that's just opening you up to get aim flinched or pushed around.
---
Yes, every nightfall has one item that you can only get as a rare random drop from the chest at the end. [More information about nightfall loot and how to get it](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/9rjfwf/nightfall_specific_loot_farming_having_a_highest/_. 
---
That looks more like a crack binge than a holliday
---
Don't do it "for the Vanguard"....
---
Do it for Cayde 6
---
I could see it being possible with Rat King, but it does sound like a pretty difficult combination.
---
Once u complete all the other adventures on Titan heroic versions will be available daily. 
---
Agreed.  I’m a hunter that has no hunter vanguard.  Do you want to know what I do have though?  A Dredgen title and all the motes I can carry. 🐍
---
I have to do all adventures to unlock heroics?  I am level 652 on an alt, I have to go back and do all that?
---
Just like the simulations
---
Honestly if you subbed to Origin, that means you get anthem and mass effect for $15 a month and that is not a bad deal.  I got to the end game to the quest to grind the ever loving shit outta crap I already played a ton to do it again but 100 more times for shit.  That is when I put it down and went back to D2 for the new season.
---
Half of the nine? Which side gets more supporters? Do both sides get 4,5 nines? 
---
Vanguard...only 1 reason...Cayde.
---
Just run Bergusia over and over. If Jotünn don't drop, Le Monarque will lol
---
Same
---
Well I'm a lot different than most people but I love explosive payload and overflow so the hand cannon and scout rifle are deity rolls. Void auto has overflow and rampage I think.  I'm just happy to get a void auto. Don't know why they removed the ability to decide element.
---
I heard the praxic order likes fire, so I say we let 'em burn.
---
Could someone give me some context? I didn't played the new expansion, busy with anthem and TD2
---
Fifthded 
---
Chattering Bone, Lord of Wolves, Curated Bad Omens. Well of radiance with Lunafaction Boots. If I trust my sentry to protect from invaders, I'd run with breakneck with rampage extender mode.
---
Oh that might have to do more with the LL of what you have in your bank. If you have a bunch of 500-550 items in your bank it speeds up the gear scaling. It's the same in WoW.
---
Have you got annual pass?
---
Damn Sparrow is a plane
---
I was too. And i stayed hyped until endgame content cause by the time i did it for the 100th~ time i realized i didnt give a shit about the game but the company of the friends i made cause of it. And its been 1 year and we are all still good friends. We moved onto Siege, Terraria, Minecraft, Smash and back to Siege. Fuck base game D2 but it also gave me good friends so i cant be too mad
---
Yes.
---
It's a annual pass event thing don't worry about it
---
I’m all out of suggestions then sorry 😅
---
That's what I have though 
---
It just released today
---
I was in normal Gambit so I'll try Gambit prime. Coulda swore it said either. 
---
Is your pursuits inventory full? 
---
ye
---
I was 13 when D1 came out. I’m finishing my senior year in high school right now, procrastinating on an essay draft to get Thorn. Time doesn’t exist for me at this point, it all happens so fast.
---
*All the bad warlocks
---
It's fine, thanks for the help though. :)
---
Happens today friend.  First week of Joker’s Wild was kind of like the introduction to the season.  Now we’re getting into the nitty gritty.
---
 Sliding with the vanguard because the drifter definitely had something to do with Cayde’s death
---
Ouch, I have had a few 93 and 94 matches but never came that close.  Some day I will get it, good luck to you.
---
Woot! Thank you 
---
Congrats man, that thing is a beaut. Is that what the ornament looks like? 
---
Who used us, and then tried to keep me from hunting our best friends killer.
---
Im having the same problem, its because I had full pursuits, im trying to trouble shoot but idk wut to do
---
Depends on the perks.
---
I sided with the vanguard and it seems my quest is bugged on the gambit step
---
Exact same situation, could be doing an English paper or an essay for Econ. Wondering how early I can catch that bus home to grab Thorn, grind out chores, and play some other games. I dunno how I’m going to break habits, there’s too many good games imo.
---
it seems like every 3 void kills is 1 percent and every 2 void HC kills is 1 percent....might try comp see if that makes it any faster tbh....just got 4 kills in comp and went up 3 percent seems much much faster
---
Have you finished the introductory Gambit Prime quest? The one that looks like a gambit coin on fire. 
---
I was all for a nerf, it was way too strong. But now seeing the status of supers like spectral blades, it shouldn’t have been nerfed as much as it was
---
Whether we wanted it or not.....
---
Ha ha.
---
It's not necessarily lack of loot, but more of lack of usable loot. There's almost no variety in what we get and what we want to look at. 95% of armor types are just good for parts
---
Yees I needed this
---
That's the allegiance quest 😂😂
---
seventhed
---
I just got back into the game with the new season, so I missed all of BA, this blows since I got the bow frame as a reward for unlocking one of the forges, so this week is loads of fun knowing that there’s no new frame I can get.
---
No, we don't all do it. 
---
Yes. I even revisited the drifter to see if I would get the option to chose a seconded time. Sadly with no result. 
---
seems legit
---
Hmm breaking my neck seems legit now
---
Yeah. It's my favorite shader for weapons. 
---
Yes. There is a status that pops up on screen when you stand in the designated spot during damage phase.
---
Hmmmmmm...perhaps
---
Any one know where the one in the winding cove is?
---
Very nice 
---
Let me live my life
---
Seems like we all understand what you're saying perfectly well
---
Do you own the annual pass? 
---
More likely had something to do with Shin than the drifter 
---
Okay thanks!!
---
Salt mines on the edz. In the first part of the mine there is a teleporter. Then go through to the top of the hill and go through a cave and walk through the put out fire.  
---
Just kidding, found it. Its behind where you spawn on the little rock island, its a little console. 
---
Would cayde even technically have a soul? Does he even have a conscience? I know he is a conscious stored into an exo but is that still technically a conscience? Or just very complex and large amount of code that would make up the original conscience?
---
i did
---
Random Dreaming City powerful gear
---
Yea I have the last word questline just havent done it 
---
I'm not sure, I play on PC. I have no idea about PSN, sorry.
---
wha? where?
---
😂 yup
---
It does oddly enough.
---
The core mechanics are good but it's very clearly unfinished and will need a massive total overhaul of the loot system.
---
I almost feel weird saying it but for all its faults in y1 at least Destiny 2 was a complete game on launch. 
---
You ever think that sometimes their internet just shits itself? I'm sure people also wouldn't leave comp so much if pvp in this game wasn't complete shit but yeah, let's always get upset at our teammates over a game that's such a minor thing in everyday life
---
Thank you so much. I couldn’t find a distinction even though I knew the wording. 
---
Yep. January patch:
---
The damage is now heavily weighted on the delayed explosion instead of the knife impact
---
Now deals self-damage if the knives explode too close
---
Fixed a bug where the knives would track allies
---
Are either of you using a void HC?
---
Either way the Drifter directly murdered 3 Guardians.
---
Its been a while since i have been down that way in the EDZ. Felt like i was being shown a new area entirely. 
---
So basically you're crying about it until you get to use it. Stop your whining and get good at the game. It's completely possible to beat OEM users lmao you act like a team with a single OEM is undefeatable.
---
Drifter is a weak punkass. My Hunter is Vanguard all the way.
---
(My Titan is probably drifting though. She crazy.)
---
Made for a thumbnail for the location of where to start the Thor quest!, I'll link it when it's uploaded.
---
Cool motive, still murder.
---
I vote we start a new thread where everyone with a 666 piece of gear can show it off.  So many every god dang day.
---
The quest did become time locked. Instead, the weapon was put into the exotic drop pool. So it was basically the quest that was time locked, not the gun.
---
I thought I read the patch notes..did they buff the drop rate again?
---
Same happened to me 
---
did you kill both Knights before finishing off the shrieker?
---
I love spinning around to catch incoming invaders.
---
Lol snitch’s get stitch’s 
---
What is the light level requirement for the mission 
---
That was  beautiful
---
You got the aspic in your lips?
---
Let me add this asshole so I can block and report 
---
Wights on the field!
---
Meanest tease by Bungie
---
[removed]
---
Lore reference/ byf/ myelin games link pls
---
Activision
---
well i think they patched the drops today as well so the powerful upgrades will be powerful until 690 then it goes to the +1 thing.
---
Dunno, most of these were from dreaming city bounties/activities btw including a celestial nighthawk and 2 sunshots I got just before believe it or not
---
we killed everything 
---
Its impossible to miss. Yet somehow people do. Its bigger than a Well of Radiance and glows bright bright ass white that makes the title screen look dark
---
Awww man, I took a break from the game and missed that. Thanks for letting me know! I might have to look at void builds now or something 
---
Aerial carpet bombing 😂😂😂😂😂
---
They’re the new hunters gauntlets Liars Handskae. You can tell by the SoTD symbol 
---
How to find the Thorn quest *pay $50* no pay no play😢
---
wowzerz bruh. That's some wild RNG.
---
have to choose between drifter missions or vangaurd. it warns you will have different missions etc with no information

So you befriended a more sour Zavahla, Chris is lame the Colonel told me so.

That was criticism, but was not at all constructive.
