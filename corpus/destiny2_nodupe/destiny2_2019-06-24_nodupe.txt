Yeah I agree I didn‚Äôt want to know what Riven looked like before doing the raid but after hearing some stories about the mechanical complexity I decided to have a look.
---
---
---
It is one of my favorites and I have been playing ever since the game came out
---
Mine is a potentially popular opinion:
---

---
I would pay AAA price for an expansion that let play the remastered D1 raids
---
Never raided and probably never will
---
Titan... shoot gun? No, titan punch!
---
And regardless, he is now the Hunter Vanguard. Ugh. I'm a hunter main. I second the motion to have every Hunter shove Spectral Blades up his ass, furthermore I invite the Titans with their flaming hammers, and the Warlocks with their Nova Bombs. But you guys go after we do, we have first dibs.
---
which mission
---
I was playing menagerie and one (exotic engram) fell off the side of the floor and I couldn't get to it, meanwhile it ended up at the postmaster. Thank God.
---
Talk about inflation
---
Considering they change how your strats are? Yes. This isn't Y1 where all weapons were the same and if you didn't have them it was due to RNG/Not being bothered to farm them out. 
---
Then I'd agree. Exotics are _nice_ but not required. But then Bungo turns around and puts out pvp purples that are _as good if not better_ than exotics. You can't tell me the Recluse doesn't absolutely smoke the Riskrunner.
---
Perfection
---
never mind, got it!
---
Crow hopefully, as somebody mentioned to me
---
Pretty much
---
Literally everyone in my D2 discord agrees that warlocks are OP beyond belief. Even the warlock players.
---
Right? Not even a hairdresser. Don't people change their hairs in their universe? Like, damn.
---
He's better than old Drifter! He still calls me a damn snitch! Shaxx would never
---
Lol. That's a loaded question to many of us who have played for a long time. We all have our opinions on other classes. (I'm a Warlock main)
---
Hunters are very good in PvP, they have great mobility and supers, and just feel really good.
---
‚ÄúHive! Bring a sword‚Äù
---
Hey mate, if we could donate gear to one another, I happily give you mine.
---
Cammy cakes actually has a video of him using the ‚Äúempty‚Äù sword strike as part of some combo lol. It‚Äôs ridiculous
---
I want to keep hitting res right before the wall of deletion hits him and then just keep doing it so I can kill him over and over again
---
If there is one thing that‚Äôs op. It‚Äôll probably be warlocks with their hand held supernova that can one shot you and ntm nova warp. ‚ò†Ô∏è
---
It's really good but has too high of risk/reward, you have to be pretty skilled to use it
---
Nice dude, im stuck on getting grenade kills
---
Mine has feeding frenzy and kill clip and i love it, but it really depends on what kind of perks you like
---
Salad bin*
---
\&gt; Get six treasures for Calus bounty  
---
\&gt; Percentage increase: 1%
---
They‚Äôre a two shot. Technically burning mall could with a few roaring flames, but that‚Äôs really hard to get
---
YAAASSSSSSSSS!!!
---
Men all want one thing and it‚Äôs fucking breathtaking
---
We need poker in tower
---
I‚Äôm fairly certain you have to get the bundle but I may be wrong
---
People think shoulder charge is bad ...laughs in titan...
---
FF + KC for crucible and FF + rampage for PvE
---
This post needs more attention
---
Bungie continues to be prove that the world would be a better place without Triple A publishers.
---
Needs more Lord of wolves
---
We need a Lord of wolves buff /s
---
Binsalad?
---
I'm Android soooooo..... Cool idea, but I don't think it's worth the time

Haha yeah i just did it for the meme lol
---
r/hydrohomies

Thats ah... uhhh... oh yeah! Its that savathun dude. Obviously
---
You're console right? Aim assist dragged your shot away when the wizard leaped in front of the shot, so you missed the ogre.
---
Wait. Is he alive? Can you tell me how?
---
It‚Äôs kinda just habit
---
A Top Gear meme is always a special treat
---
Yea, Bungie has a track record of making a specific bounty/quest step waaaaaaay grindier than the other bounties/steps that give identical rewards
---
Fisting with the boyyyyys
---
Fusions are good against it
---
How
---
Mountaintop double kills
---
What is that thing?
---
What's LoW?
---
I would agree but the amount of times i phase through people, land ontop of them, make contact but nothing happens, etc is so high. I just want consistency lol.
---
For the love of god please learn to read the whole comment. I said when everyone is 750 maybe we could. I never said i have. Or that i would waste time trying when sweatcicle or someone will save me the time and do a 4 minute video on it.
---
It‚Äôs fine I pulled a ten paces with rampage and got the 25 kills in about 30 minutes. I have the AoS now.
---
CAUSE DENNIS IS A BASTARD MAN!
---
As with HD, too much high tech is often redundant. I'm sure Mercules has it figured out.
---
300+ tokens, warlock bounties done and not a single swarm. Not to mention I‚Äôm severely underpowered so it makes IB even more frustrating
---
Mayhaps calus's treasured
---
I respect your opinion
---
I died too many time facing those thralls
---
It wasn‚Äôt even that bad.
---
My team has already one phased Gahlran with other options. Sure a Quick kill is fun, but Swarm is definitely not required like cluster bombs were for the riven cheese. Any team worth their salt wouldn't require this gun. They should be fine with you using prospector or another alternative.
---
Ah, apologies, I see I‚Äôm late to the meeting of cultured men
---
dude that was back for trials of the nine. it's patched now. If opposing team bails out during queue, it's not counted as a win
---
Possibly, for now it is C U B E
---
Heroic events increased power level? Sorry. I played year 1 but I don't remember heroic events giving my high light level gear. 
---
The best way to increase light level is by doing challenges such as 3 strikes and crucible. There's a daily challenge that will get you higher light level gear too. There's also a lot of stuff to do in the dreaming city that gets you higher light. Many people in the tower have powerful gear bounties as well. 
---
As for weapons: many people in the crucible are using outbreak perfected and hand cannons with great perks. There's also a massive amount of people using snipers (specifically beloved) because of this season's pinnacle weapon. I'm not too sure about pve though
---
I don't think and hope trading will ever be a thing.
---
I'm thinking more the acolyote eyes. Great work, again!
---
YOU TRIED TO POP ITS GLISTENING MAGNIFICENCE!
---
If you want to play today, get forsaken and the annual pass. You do have to play through the forsaken campaign first, but then you can do a short quest for this season and be 690 light ready to do the new activities.
---
If you want to wait till the end of summer though, it sounds like Shadowkeep will let you catch up with out this past years content.
---
That being said there is a TON of good content for you to sink your teeth into now.
---
Reloading behind a rally lulz.
---
Yeah thats still a thing
---
Nah. Drifters got those booster quests. As long as uldren has the annual pass he should be not far behind the rest of us.
---
Reminds me of that one scene from Stargate Sg1
---
You‚Äôll get multiples with different rolls just need to be patient. They drop often enough.
---
Check the discord if you can get your hands on it.
---
Khepri‚Äôs Sting
---
That awkward moment on Reddit when you realize you got something everyone wants and had no idea it was a thing o.o 
---
glad I broke down the other one and not the one with spikey grenades oof
---
Not gonna lie totally forgot really would reload if I stepped forward lol. I just new I needed bullets for the guy pushing me
---
I'm already at fabled. 85% done with double kills, 56% done with medals. I pretty much open destiny 2, play crucible for a few hours, close the game.
---
I can get the weapon, but damn is the quest so annoying
---
Trading should **NOT** exist in Destiny. It's a system that doesn't belong, and would fundamentally break the game to where it's even less fun. 
---
They've done so much with D2 to hand feed you different ways of getting the loot you want. Especially now with Menagerie getting to choose **Specifically** what you want.
---
*Want a God roll blank?* Just go trade for it. **No.** Rng is Rng.
---
If your buddy has something nice and you don't, then that's good for him. Should either keep farming for it or look for something else.
---
They can be fine. Ubisoft, for example, is pretty decent. 
---
But when they have a large amount of sway, it's not good news at all. Activision clearly had more sway then was said.
---
Man i tried it so many times. My own team never acceptsüò¢
---
This is the correct answer.
---
Accurate.
---
he flexed on you when you died
---
Oh I've seen this one! It's a classic!
---
That is correct, on the Bungie website they are very clear that all your progress and purchases will transfer from battle net to steam. They have not yet said exactly how it's going to work besides that, though.
---
Yes, that's what it sounds like.
---
I have the base game when it was offered for free, I want forsaken but noticed that steam does not have it listed with the new DLC Shadowkeep.
---
Is forsaken going to be available for free? Or is the DLC will come to Steam? I just finished the base game and started CoO and soon will do Warmind,
---
Play hyper passively, cover, peek, kill 1 or 2 ads, move cover, repeat, when ads are down do the same for boss
---
Its gonna literally be an endgame scene for when Crota sees the new Giardians thinking they are the same ones that slayed him.
---
But not for me, he has a deathwish for me.
---
I dont believe that man ever went to medical school
---
And also find two other like minded players, I think it's impolite not to get a full fireteam if you are going to be playing in other than the intended manner.
---
What cheese??
---
Those are some committed Thrall
---
yeah there was "uck nerfs" on XBL after the infamous "nerf everything TWAB", bloke doing the same as here. His gamertag image was even a big red capital F so same happened when you looked at his profile on xbox, not just in destiny. Was incredible. Needed the comic relief that day too
---
Edit: thanks for the gold and silver kind guardians
---
That was my issue. I‚Äôm doing it with a fire team. So we all know what‚Äôs going on. We just need to be lucky enough to get corrupted strike now.
---
Shhh ! They‚Äôll nerf it!
---
Think so. Was meant to reply to someone talking about publishers
---
True. Most of the time we don't even use voice when doing NF or Gambit or any milestones stuff. Except raid of course. Not everything requires voice comm anyway.
---
Or: A small price to pay for salvati√ªn
---
Reasonable
---
Great damage! So close to winning!
---
What part of the quest you on
---
Please explain
---
"Alright, let's test this bad bo-"
---
Fugo upgrades to aggressive frame fork
---
Daily heroic adventure + chicken head mask got rid of mine
---
That's not a random drop from the engrams that Shaxx give you?
---
Polaris lance, sweet business, black talon, izanagis burden, I love them all :D
---
honestly this has helped tonnes thank you so much!
---
My blizzard account got hacked (location tracker shows 300+ mile distance between logins only a few minutes apart) and after that i got banned from destiny 2. With how bans work on pc (only the bnet accounts get banned from any activision title) do you think there is any chance of getting my account back when it moves over to steam?
---
No its a quest that has you get 200 pulse rifle kills, reach legend in regular crucible, have you get 75 multikills, 150 pulse rifle kills and you need 5 valor resets in a single season
---
Maybe if you hadn't done those 2 completely pointless reloads, you would have lived :P
---
:facepalm:   
---
Ok, thank you for poiting me in the right direction xD
---
Np just a friendly shark
---
Was that persons name by any chance "Nhaughty"
---
When you get in to events watch what higher level guardians are doing there‚Äôs some process to make it heroic it‚Äôs good for you to learn
---
Wasn‚Äôt that boost replaced by calus‚Äô boost?
---
Make sure your computer/the game is using the GPU and not the integrated one one your CPU
---
It literally only took me around 140 (99 when I was actually trying to get one) tokens to obtain o roll with spike grenades and field prep
---
That could be the issue. What platform are you on?
---
I like the wish ended with Foestracer  exotic helm and am good at using it in crucible thought I would try out the le monatque with oathkeepers work very well
---
How much are these things. I really want me a rivensbane one

Activision is no longer publishing destiny, effectively making bungie an indie company. Since this split destiny has seen major improvements, less luck based micro transactions and bungie have more or less said that activision were handicapping their ability to make content, saying that with activision they were working to meet a corperate schedule not to build a great game. In a nutshell the split with activision means bungie can now do all the cool the fans want instead of doing stuff that throws money into the never ending pits of activisions bank account
---
Bungie left Activision. What rock have you been sleeping under? Lmfao
---
Bungie trying to compete with GFUEL, I see
---
I still haven't got a desire rune. On the positive, my Beloved dropped with drop mag/snapshot/box breathing which is a good mix of pvp and pve.
---
&gt;with last word 
---
The next worse thing
---
Bungie and Activision separated a little while ago. Bungie is no longer required to make a d2, or make any type of deadline set by Activision or follow their orders/suggestions (this is mostly regarding microtransactions and their content model). 
---
Now bungie has full control to do whatever they want with destiny for the first time, and they are proving it to be a good thing.

There are weapons from year 1 that are still viable - like Midnight Coup and  the Ikelos weapons.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
On the other hand, you can find alternatives for them from year 2 .
---
I'd say , go for all the exotics - you will find some decent rolled legendarys on the way.
---
No, but forsaken+annual pass is only $40 right now, and i bet will see another discount on the way to shadowkeep. June/july is usually the worst tiem to buy a destiny bundle, as they always throw discounts on old stuff once the new stuff drops in September. 
---
Shadowkeep should also have a powerboost system to get you into the action, should you want to only get that and effectivelyskip year two. Their new content model going forward is to pay for the things you want, nothing else.
---
I love the graviton! Its my ole reliable when im playing shite. 
---
Didnt have the catalyst annoyingly
---
Ok thank you bro i will try to aim for range and stability
---
What kind of monster uses top tree with nighthawk
---
Yeah but that was Activision's own fault. They could have had more money now if they let Bungie do what it thought was best for maintaining a userbase. Activision pushing micro-transactions and casual play so hard resulted in mediocre launch day reviews and a rapidly dwindling usebase after launch. Doesn't matter how much cash shop stuff you push out, if the userbase isn't there and happy you're fucked.
---
everyone. 
---
I remember...... I was unprepared.........
---
Same. Lol. I feel like I'm actually playing the game now
---
I‚Äôm not an expert but common sense tells me that you probably should.
---
Unless there are some obvious reasons for an x-ray, they should be at least 3 years apart.
---
They are probably just using your insurance to get paid.
---
Kindled Orchid.   3% per Precision kill.
---
For pvp anything with range for pve anything with surrounded, one-two lunch, trench barrel, or swashbuckler
---
its funn because... with activision gone, and bungie apparently finally getting their heads straight (there were rumors about major problems during D1 and D2 which caused such a shot story line) i feel like if they let d2 grow for a while on steam, D3 (if they ever release it) will hold up to the expectations activision had... the interest in the franchise is there, and they CAN pull such a thing off
---
For?
---
Ok thank you, but what shotgun would you most likelly prefer to use in pvp ?
---
Saw someone with this barely a week after they'd dropped.
---
Items from year 1 or even s1 was able to obtain some time ago. If you got armor part frim evervese then you should be able to take that part from collection. After forsaken i noticrd lack of some. Parts from 1st season from eververse. Probably changes didn't catched up everything.
---
You can, but power levels are still a thing. Forsaken starts mid 300‚Äôs powereise
---
Ya you can skip to fr
---
Forsaken
---
Embrace the Praxic Fire!
---
Haha that‚Äôs happened to me quite a few times except I always seemed to be using a grenade launcher.
---
What?
---
I know we can pull them from collections but we cant have perks on them can we?
---
What the hell is a queen breakers bow?
---
yeah, raids and menagerie are both good for it. I'm at like 68% now, went up from 45% after i did a CoS run. 
---
but unless Bungie intended to have one very grindy weekly quest from Werner, I think it's most likely broken lol.
---
??? It still is a good weapon
---
Whoever thought of putting that bounty on rotation at the same time as banner is cruel. The one week I'm focused on pvp is the week that needs hours of pve grind.
---
Last years season of solstice armor
---
I mean it‚Äôs Reddit. But thanks.
---
Story of my life.
---
It‚Äôs a mainstay in my primary slot. 3 taps at any range.
---
I‚Äôm actually hardly seeing it anywhere. Played 5+ hours of Ian over the past day and only encountered very few. Although I am on PS4.
---
Yup. There was some crying people about it.
---
My personal way of playing the game, pre-forsaken was I got to use the weapons I had worked for whenever I wanted, whilst increasing my level. I don't see why that's a big ask, why should I have to slog toward the end game just to use the weapons I want to use consistently?
---
No
---
Yeah it is the final one. It‚Äôs a very powerful armour.
---
It's not. It's got insane recoil. The lack of recoil on pc is why it's broken
---
It all depends from what season is said armor piece. If it's one frome before forsaken then they have fixed perk. If it's after forsaken then "you can't take randomized items".
---
If you meany mods then yes every piece should have possibility to give mods to them.
---
Im considering for pvp playstyle
---
Verry gud!
---
I figured.
---
Well, it is also called a weekly quest..

Bungie held back because they had all the creativity sucked out of them due to Activision not wanting to cannibalize Call of Duty and World of Warcraft.
---
Imo the warlock is always useful in any situation (except 1, but that depends on your coordination) running Luna and middle tree dawnblade. 
---
Heal everyone, save their reloads, convert your grenade for people who are running at things. It helps. 
---
Hunter, it would still depend on 1) burn  2) what exotics you have. Cause I can list why top tree arc strider has been my favorite forever, but that doesn't matter if you don't have radiant flux or liar's handshake.
---
How was this misinformation. I've played the game I know what the system was and what it is now.
---
What the hell was that warlock at the end doing?
---
The unfortunate thing is that it keeps a lot of people from trying the game and finding  out they really like it when they otherwise would have.
---
sung jin woo and his shadow army from a webcomic called solo leveling
---
It's probably because he was rude for no reason
---
you could, just remember that both CoO and Warmind gives you free exotics for completion and you want to get those before you get 'lucky' at Xur
---
The more recent one, and the self damage wasn't that exploitable.
---
Also the first nerf wasn't quite what you say it was, the instant super was a bug that was fixed, but the first nerf was packaged with the bug fix to ensure that it couldn't ever happen again by capping and reducing super regen. Also the most recent nerf further reduced super regen even more which is why it is a completely dead exotic on top of being an already dead exotic. The previous cap from the first nerf made the self damage not that big of a deal, it was really people throwing the shoulders on briefly to get a bit of a boost to fill their super which was problematic, but it was a rare thing you almost never saw.
---
We need buffs for items that aren't part of the meta at all. That's how you keep a game fresh and prevent it from getting stale. That's why we had the nerfs to shakeup the sandbox. The nerfs weren't that impactful though because it didn't bring up much else to make them worth using.

Thank you! I will be trying to buy Forsaken within the next fortnight and hopefully Season of Opulence is still ongoing by then :) really appreciate the info

Sound:m...m?...m!?...mmm!!!?

The state of the game goes up and down. Some DLCs were not as good as expected, gun/super/exotic balance is broken sometimes. But this game, as a whole, is consistently better than any other. I play other games from time to time, and I complain about things, but it just has something that other games don't, and I love it. If you can find a clan or have friends to play and raid with, your experience will increase 100 fold
---
While either him or I could explain more in detail, your question has been asked so frequently that there is a plethora of much more in depth answers that can be found by searching this subreddit community for terms like "returning player" and "worth coming back?". I'm certain you will find much better answers than I might be able to provide off of the top of my head.
---
This question, along with "what have I missed?" is posted 10+ times a day.

In short I'll tell you yes it's worth it. The game is great right now, and getting better all the time. I wish you the best of luck in finding the answers you seek, and welcome back Guardian!

---
&gt; Pre-Forsaken you could just take any weapon with a higher level and use it to increase the power of any gear you desire, allowing you to without effort keep using whatever gear you want to use for as long as you want whilst you gain levels. Now to my understanding you have to keep changing gear to new drops instead of using the gear you want to use in order to gradually increase your power level.
---
There's also a significant fee for leveling exotics so you can't just keep leveling your favourite weapon without depleting all your resources. It's a complete cancer system
---
This isn't correct and, therefore, wrongful information
---
Season content doesn't go away. There's very little stuff that is limited to a certain time frame, so you'll be able to access the forges, reckoning, menagerie, etc. well after September.

Do the gunsmith boy ties everyday. Also during increased valor weeks, make sure to play crucible, as achieving max Valor gives you 10 cores. I personally reset my rank twice this weekend, netting me 20 enhancement cores. Also don't forget to pop those finest Matterweaves, and run your raids every week for a chance at currated rolls (which give 7).
---
&gt;Please note: The current $40 price of Forsaken is not affected by the additional year 1 content that it is bundled with. This was the normal price of Forsaken before and it will continue to be this.
---
I was in the same boat as you and I recently picked up the Forsaken expansion. The core gameplay is still the same they just bumped up the light level and added in new weapons. Just about everything I had legendary was obsolete along with a bunch of defunct mods. It's essentially like starting over, but Warmind was good and Forsaken was great, in terms of story and gameplay. You will need to buy the Forsaken expansion which automatically has the other DLC. Annual pass is extra and you'll need pony up for that if you want like Black Armory and stuff. Shadowkeep will be a separate purchase and you'll need to buy a new annual pass at that time for that new content.
---

Can we be over this already?
---
What are you talking about? Titan melee abilities doesn‚Äôt increase your speed, where did that came from? 
---
Also the highest resilience in the game? I can easily get 8+ resilience in all the classes not just titans, and all the resilience values and numbers are equal regardless of class. If a hunter has 7 points of resilience it means that he has more resilience that a titan with 6 points, simple as that if I remember correctly. 
---
And finally, what gave you the impression that I‚Äôm ‚Äútripping‚Äù, I‚Äôm curious..
---
I think it should be less to charge, but I think it should activate when it's full not on reload as well as maybe refill mag from reserve on activating. The idea that it doesn't stow to me made sense at least that the gauge should be lost if you don't do damage after say 5 seconds
---
Check out the Destiny fun police vid then. The video I linked was just Aztec being funny but also truthful.
---
Lol
---
So we should rework tractor cannon too? And suppression grenade? 
---
supers should be able to be shut down by more than another super. 
---
If the recoils ain't hard to control then please tell me why 1 person uses it in a game of IB with 12 other players on console. Meanwhile in  PC you see 12 LoW?
---
Seriously the only good nerf to this gun would be increase the damage, increase the range, reduce the recoil, and move it to a heavy slot. Not like we have any other heavy shotguns besides the boop gun and Acrius. It would make it so there is a heavy of each damage type.
---
It's a bug, it's supposed to just drop now, but it doesn't. Bungie will fix it at some point in the future, but every new DLC release brings with it **tons** of bugs.

It doesn't matter when you do them, do those activities if you find them fun. You will not reach enemies higher than power level 500 until you complete the Forsaken campaign. 
---
The powerful gear activities you see on the director reset every week, so you don't have to worry about "using them up." 
---
Additionally, there is now a "catch up" quest when you complete Forsaken that will give you power level 690 gear and one free trial run of an annual pass activity if you don't own the annual pass.
---
I mean... Crota's encounter was already received so well that it was applied to Taken Kings public event, a Menagerie thing called Riposte, and a Escalation Protocal boss.
---
I hope they aren't bosses. I hope theyre like some sort of "hold back these being while we close the door and no more come out!" situation.
---
It's just a pure luck thing and it makes me hate how decent RNG is for me, I got the quest the first week it came out so I never realized how rough it could be. Just keep at it unfortunately and eventually the giant sphincter in the sky will drop it's Seething Heart
---
Ah ok thanks I gotta try that mode out
---
Wonder why that is.
---
Is it because people are more accurate and just generally better on PC?
---
How it seemed to work was that the seething heart was guaranteed from your first meatball kill, not RNG
---
Put on Geomags with all super mods and just Super Kamehameha all the bosses lol
---
Yea, I gotcha. Those posts aren't allowed because it could bring undue attention to another player because their name is posted... but videos have the same thing. I just never thought about it.
---
RIP guardian üò≠
---
Yeah I was bored the other night and decided to jump into a Nightfall since it was the only reward I had left for the week. Didn't feel like finding a fireteam but it was Prison of Elders so I was a bit hesitant going in and didn't play my card.
---
Turns out I had no reason to be concerned. At all.
---
Because you don't have the pass
---
It‚Äôs been pulling from reserves for quite some time. Even into BA it was reserve pulling because I used it heavily in gofannon for carries i helped with.
---
Regardless of this content, it‚Äôs widely considered busted on console currently.
---
Something similar happened to me. My screen went black saying that i had connection problems, when i reconected as happens with you i could not make any dmg and enemies did not see me. The funny thing about that was that trying some weapons i found that i could make dmg with le monarque. So as it was a quickplay i stayed and had a great time watching the enemy team going crazy, throwing grenades, ultimates to the air trying to kill me.
---
I really think it is. And you are the first person coordinating the PC perspective. I don't mean to not listen. Cause I get it. I have seen all the YouTubers and I see how it's broke it's just that is also not what is happening in my games and I have been playing a lot. I'm sorry it's been so rough for you I am hoping they push up the fix from the currently planned September.
---
If two arc souls and people can beat 4 people then the team is garbage. Of course the rifts are going to be around corner/inside because that's the best place to put them. what is a rift going to do if it is in the open? And you said yourself 80% of maps have obvious sight lines making it easier to be a sniper. If their is a poor sight line it is the snipers job to at hit the shot or get a better one somewhere else.
---
Is the level cap at 750 now? Damn... haven‚Äôt played since I hit it at 20
---
Love it!
---
Amazing gun. True meme. But still holds no candle to Zhalo imo. Both red death and it were given the miniaturize treatment which I found to be really disappointing. I‚Äôd rather have ‚Äúnot new‚Äù ones instead of ‚Äúhere‚Äôs a new gun that‚Äôs not actually new we just cut it down and made into something less neat‚Äù
---
But this sub is for the destiny community to interact. What's the problem with me posting about this?
---
The definition of insanity. Maybe the guardians are insane. But thats just a theory.
---
Having to play tactically in every engagement doesn't work. Why would I bother playing tactically when I could just see with stompies and get the same result with less effort
---
I‚Äôm shocked to see Breakneck being put to good use like this. Breakneck never works for me in Crucible, but then again, you seem to have good mates on your side as well.
---
The seasons usually run about 3 months, and since they have already announced Shadowkeep's release in September 2019, that matches up.  Nightfalls are 540 level strikes that are designed for a fireteam of 3.  Each week has 3 nightfalls to choose from, but you only get power gear for the first one you complete and for the first one you complete with a score of over 100K.  You can LFG or join a clan to get help with doing them.  The Nightfalls can be pretty quick (under 8 minutes for a speed run) or run about 15-20 minutes for a longer one that you are doing a score run on.  It is possible to run all of the night falls before the season is over, but you have to be dilliegent in watching for them.  Some of them rarely make the list and if you miss the one week that it made it for the season you may be out of luck until the next season.  Are you wanting the emblems or are you wanting the seal?  The emblems are random drops.  You may have to do the nightfall several times before you get it. For the triumphs and seal, you only have to worry about the "season" if the triumph requires X during a single season. Anything that requires X in a single season will reset that quest step or triump at the end of the season.  Otherwise you continue to work towards the goal across the various seasons until it is complete.
---
It's silly good
---
Diff is recluse is guaranteed on fabled. You could clear every char for 3 months in cos and still not have tarrabah
---
Indeed Erentil is a sniper.
---
Just spend tokens. No need to dismantle.
---
Just tokens. It can also drop from end game and crucible rank ups/milestones now.
---
I just tested it and holy shit, yeah, it's pulling from reserves. Why though? It's a Primary Weapon
---
I wish I had a couple friends like this for help with Zero Hour on Normal 
---
I always get to the boss with randoms on the app fireteam thing, and then we hardly do damage.
---
I did all bounties on all characters without picking up the quest on any of them. Still nothing
---
I can‚Äôt even finish the first part   :|
---
[took me a bit but here u go](https://twitter.com/seamachineart/status/1137020134953037824?s=21)
---
Not really. You get a free run to experience the Menagerie to see if you like it.
---
It's like getting a free trial on something. If you like it, buy it.
---
It will keep your progress though your last completed step.  If you were half way through a step you will start that step over.
---
I just used it and yeah, it's pulling small amounts of ammo from reserves. It didn't *appear* to be pulling ALL it's ammo from reserves but still, it's a dumb mechanic for it
---
These guys have you mostly covered, but for your information, Light Level is 750 now. However, there are Gambit Prime and Menagerie "power boost" bounties/quests that drop 690 gear that will pop up your baseline level really fast. After that, there is so much powerful gear each week (as well has ways to farm specific slots of power gear using the Forges, Gambit P helmets in reckoning, any slot in Menagerie to round out an underperforming slot) that you can easily hit 750 in 2-3 weeks after that.
---
Also Nightfalls don't scale like other content. There is no level bonus in Nightfalls, so crank that negative points until you are equivalent to 540 - it makes literally no difference.
---
Yea of course,everyone is using a shotgun hehe *hides beloved together with 8 other guys in the lobby*
---
like i said, its a grind
---
There should be a quest akin to Allegiance so we can choose to become Shadows! I'd totally dump the City for that!
---
I will agree that fps games are bettter on pc than on console but as a xbox player myself I will say that I prefer console over pc for the simple fact that the community in my opinion is better on console. Of course this is my own opinion and view point so take it with a grain of salt if you dont agree.
---
&gt;and I know some others will agree with me.
---
Probably 25% of the player population will (that's the percent that play it on PC).
---
Agree. I went to PC gaming a while ago as I could afford to make a gaming pc and I'll never go back to consoles. Except some exclusives but that's about it .
---
And lets be real it's been years...It wont happen, that magic revival of D2 is a joke. it won't happen. that's not how games work. 
---
I'm just going to post this youtube playlist here. I've seen every video on it, they all share some things with destiny 2. D2 is dying, nothing. Nothing at all, will revive the player base to launch status.
---
D2 is not a dead game, its dying, and will never come back from that. Even in its brightest moments during this hard time...much like a cancer patient having a really good day. This is happening weather they believe it or not. The death of a game can take years to happen.

---
These games had millions of players, huge donations, long lifespans, but ultimately they share a theme with d2. The tiny revival after a dlc drop, its cute when people think they're game is booming after a drop. It didn't go anywhere guys... Nothing changed. New content is not a magical fix-it. Its a pipe dream, a sad one.
---
This is an objective fact. There is no console in production today that can match the performance of a gaming PC. Thats the biggest "DUH" out there.
---
That doesn't mean every player is going to go spend 1000$ on a gaming PC since the game "plays better" on it. In case you weren't aware, game performance isn't the only factor that would determine where I play.
---
For example, if all my friends have Xboxes and not PCs, why should I switch to PC? because you said so? Its immature to think that everyone should be on PC purely because it performs better. 
---
Not everyone gets a hard on when they get 60+ FPS in a game. To others, there is more to gaming than the number of frames their game plays at.
---
I got a bow with explosive tips and dragonfly. Is that overkill? Wondering how important tempo is.
---
There are 4 different bounties each week.  Try to pick up the other bounties and get one done.  You would then be able to open a chest and get a rune for your titan to use.  The chalice and runes are account wide, but the runes once slotted into the chalice become character specific.  If you cannot pick them up on your titan yet, finish it out on your warlock and get some addtional runes that way, then come back to the titan.
---
Ahh, close. PS4, I do appreciate the offer though. You're too kind
---
Higher framrate, higher resolution, oh and not to mention you can use your PC for all kinds of other shit besides gaming. PC MASTER RACE REEEEEEEEE
---
My 6 year old has more melee kills than supers. Or grenades. Or guns I think at this point. And this is all I can imagine anything he sees in its last moments. God bless the punchy bois. And god bless the poor souls who mess with that little titan üòÇ

Link to this weeks thread.
---
Hey man, I wasn‚Äôt trying to be a dick. I just simply posted my observation because I had never seen it played on Xbox before.
---
Because of course everyone has ¬£1,100+ to buy a gaming pc capable of playing the game at 60+FPS
---
Or more importantly for this game has a group of friends all capable of pay that much.
---
Huckleberry also shreds and tears into crowds without filling its ammo from reserves, Sturm is allowed to do nearly Special Weapon damage without pulling from reserves, Polaris Lance is allowed to be versatile with its damage and crowd control without pulling from reserves, it's just strange that Riskrunner is the only one to. And the point about Crown of Tempests doesn't cover Titans who may not be on Code of the Earthshaker, and Hunters who don't have any Arc grenade regen except for Lucky Raspberry which only covers Arcbolts
---
Do you play on console or PC?
---
Only intellectuals use celestial as a shutdown super
---
&gt;And I beg you please tell how the best experience for this game is playing where my friends aren't? 
---
Yep. That's the biggie. 
---
I have a PC but I will probably never but destiny for it.
---
When I played for the first time, I was level 50 before I even finished the 3rd campaign and went into Forsaken ready for anything. 
---
Next character, I use the boost and now I have to grind adventures and events before I even want to touch forsaken.
---
Karma is a bitch huh?

I think they may have gotten confused with this article again not to sure
---
When you gotta secure that one kill
---
got my 1k voices this past tuesday, only 4 more exotics to go, got all three characters to 750. less than 3k infamy to finally have my 21% delirium. (burnt out on gambit so bad since forsakens launch). just need to get that CoS completion to feel mostly content.
---
What‚Äôs the thinking behind Khepri‚Äôs Horn?
---
...the horn
---
Also outbreak
---
Throw a set of 750 weapons on it, and collect your weekly look from hawthorne. It's what I do with my alts and they level up really quickly. I also try and do a 100k nightfall, and knock out a pvp daily and gambit. They are easy and really fast and thats like 6 pieces of gear in an hour a week.
---
It‚Äôs called playing warlock
---
Hey just to make sure, you can only do the Iron Banner quest once per season or can you do it again when IB comes back around?
---
Will shadowkeep include only season 8? Or does it include the next seasons as well?
---
Did this with my friend and I just ran celestial. He's like oh a boss BANG oh it's dead.
---
It's sad. We lost a person from my clan to PC. And now he just doesn't play at all cause "I don't have anyone to play with, but I won't go back to Xbox...."
---
 
---
Like what dood? ü§£
---
TeaCrab. What an amazing name!
---
This was me 2 weeks ago because I got back into the game but I had to switch to Xbox do it was a fresh start
---
I honestly don‚Äôt mind sweats, I think it‚Äôs really the only time the age old teabag is not only accepted but encouraged
---
Your friendly Hunter main here! Ill list some reasons why we are the best, its very simple.
---
1. Cloaks &gt; Bonds
---
2. Hunter jump &gt; Warlock "jump"
---
3. Cayde 6 is our mentor - RIP 
---
4. Blade barrage is one of the most synergistic classes in all of D2
---
5. All Hunter supers give you vastly different playing styles in times of boredom of repetition of using the same super
---
Honestly though, play what makes you most happy. All classes have their highs and lows. Thats why I go with the best looking one ;)
---
Bullshitttt, they have hands down the most brain dead supers and they ALWAYS get a multikill with it, to top it off they can heal. Come onnnnn
---
You could always use the top tree for the super and run with the warlock arm exotic that recover health on melee kill.  Then you get the best of both worlds.
---
After grinding for hush, i don't know how much more popcorn i could possibly eat.
---
I think hunters stand head and shoulders above titan chunky shoulders
---
U tell him girl
---
I think you can only do the Menagerie once if you don't have Season Pass.  Beyond that I'm not sure why it wouldn't have completed the quest for you.
---
It's random, but imperials still drop from any number of activities. IB included, I believe. And the Werner bounty alone only rewards 150. The triumph is 500. Either way, the lesson is: just have fun. You'll get there.
---
What about the nerf to machine guns where they delete a blocking sentinel super. It's pretty easy to counter sentinel, you're just mad that you/your team wouldn't stop shooting at the big glowy target.
---
Sorry if I sound mad, I just don't like when people try to make out that a slightly viable exotic needs to be nerfed when everything else my main has isn't nearly on-par with other classes.
---
That's true. But if we're being real the LoW is probably gonna be nerfed to all hell by the time the next set of pinnacle weapons come out, and you would have to re-proc memento mori since it now gets rid of it when stowed. Just a thought ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
Wow, can't believe I missed that. Gotta get up from under my rock apparently lol
---
feels bad for you
---
Soooooooo true, happene all the time
---
I felt the same way. Got lucky enough to get one after doing almost all my bounties on 2 chars. Immediately deleted all the bounties I had left and called it a wrap. One was at 99 percent and didn‚Äôt think twice about it. Best of luck to get yours OP
---
what part of the world are you from?
---
Was about to say something so evil I would get banner soooooooo... no I won't
---
Im gonna ask, what console you have played on before and just say maybe keep playing it till September and when cross save becomes available on the 17th. Just log that in on pc via steam and everyone will be happy. Thats whatvim doing. My ps4 account has just about every uear 1 exotic except a few, and im gonna play console till this happens. And when it does ill just play my ps4 account on my pc.
---
im in IL, USA and I play mostly at night....beyond 10pm CST
---
I really hope it's just an optional quest then, even tho it's grindy, I prefer to level up slowly
---
Okey I'll try look into it thx :)
---
Do it. On DM im curous now &gt;:)
---
Yeah I know, sucks tying down the exotic for that though. I mean my loadout can get the job done just would be nice to get one heavy GL with spikes, ever.
---
Sadly no because you get overwhelmed by their numbers.
---
The time limit is the same though.
---
I still can't belive it was my First exotic by choice
---
In IB a bunch of randos and I were crushing a 5 stack, it must have upset them because they all equipped Wolves and came back to win by like 5 points or something.
---
It's a weeb joke ignore it
---
Ever time you summon your ghost with this shell it should make Minecraft ambient sounds
---
I am just confused on how it survived the first set of reworks for exotics way back. Is there something I‚Äôm missing or is it basically not useful at all?
---
oh sorry my bad deleting now
---
On your heavy? That's why you use militias birthright or orewings maul for it. At the very least, use Fighting Lion.
---
Player level cap is 50, but light/power level is 750.
---
We will watch your career with great interest
---
Shoot at the feet/ground.
---
That gritty, realistic look. Fuck Yea
---
Um, get the app?
---
Tap the trigger, firmly planted, particle repeater, long scope, stability mw
---
Yeah it's fine on console.
---
I‚Äôm not thinking so guy. iOS?
---
Well done, fellow Gunslinger
---
go go power rangers
---
Proxy nades were nerfed and make it so you can't one shot anymore
---
Slightly unrelated: whenever I'm running through the Infinite Forest, and I have to open the door between each section, I hear Mara/Riven saying "OPEN THE DOOR".
