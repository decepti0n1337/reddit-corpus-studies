get on my level i got mine on the 7 same for my 1k
---
---
---
Worse thing is hearing invader down. And then, killed by architects with their tag
---
Used to be winter wolf with around 6k kills (if people are being dicks then NF with revoker)
---
Oh my god..
---
Ah, a man of culture, using autorifles in crucible!
---
I stopped playing after Osiris, just started again
---
I‚Äôm curious about it in shadowkeep with the scout buffs...
---
Its still decent, as well as most other random weapons. The only thing alot of people dont realize with "random" weapons is you  gotta pair them better than per say dust rock, lunas, wardcliff (ps i hate you people, not personally but y'all  just too extra)
---
They aren't?
---

---
Pulse rifles are very strong right now. Trace rifles too.
---
Auto rifles (minus suros) and scouts however aren't in a good place.
---
It‚Äôs not from eververse.
---
Looking at that weird giant pool of orbs near the boss
---
Whether or not he perceives it doesn‚Äôt change that it‚Äôs still less time and more beneficial.
---
I run Gahlrans Right Hand and Coldheart in crucible ( don‚Äôt ask me how it works, it just does )
---
Don't know much about that.......getting Last Word and not being able to hit the broadside of a barn with the hipfire different story.
---
That‚Äôs the wall brother
---
lmao, reminds me of when I finally got queen breaker from a fated engram......... aaaaand then xur was selling it next week.
---
Well you have all the range with one almost equivalent to a scout and another is a freaking laser. Rat king is also fun, yes even solo
---
So my second roll wasnt AS terrible lol....trying again after i get off work
---
_LAUGHS IN LION RAMPARTS WITH TRACTION_
---
I main Coldheart in crucible, I just felt like I could always depend on it in crucible
---
Its consistent, something winter wolf isnt always and most weapons arent necessarily  as consistent
---
[removed]
---
Feels bad
---
If you play D2, I 100% recommend picking up and playing through all of D1. Especially now it‚Äôs only about $30 I think for 3 years of content. Be prepared though for some quality of life changes added in D2 to be missing though.
---
But why would you leave the bubble, it's scary out there...
---
This !!
---
Running max discipline and armamentarium to make sure that supers dont exist
---
Sorry, but that KHD causes it to revert to its plastic value.
---
Me, gets to the high ground over some cursed thralls.
---
Hive: Good, good, now melee them
---
Me: I shouldn't, it's not the hunter way
---
Hive: DEW IT
---
A combo of sentinel and siegebreaker, that is terrifying
---
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs right you know‚Äù-Morgan Freeman
---
Totally a nerf. Shorter barrel (or no barrel), shorter effective range. Didn't you watch that video on the Chaperone ornament?
---
Bungie gave us exact numbers. Im not pulling these claims out of my ass. It‚Äôs literally in the twab.
---
As opposed to handicapped hunters who hide crouched with a shotgun and hop around like idiots ?
---
The main issue stems from oh if i have better reaction time and shoot you first and you kill me with a shotty or shoulder charge, you get health over-shield and a dmg boost just because i can react faster.
---
I always hated going alone down into the moon. That place still gives me the creeps. Plus like alone? You got a lot of bs to deal with.
---
Exploding jerks. Knights. Guardian tracking blasts from the stones, big bois sprouting lasers out of their mouth. A whole lot of fuck you down there.
---
Shottys are a semi skill weapon.  Best way to counter a shotty? Remove those heads with a sniper before they get in range.  Or pull a Cammy and no scope people with a hip fore grip.  Plenty of counters out there bud.  Just gotta find them.
---
Keep it up dude!
---
This. A bad player can git good but only because of OEM.  A skilled player uses OEM for the insta overshield to take on 2-4 people easy.  But skilled players would also know that top tree semtinel can do the same thing with a melee kill. It's all positioning and game sense.  I prefer top tree with synth because I just love beating the fk outta people :)
---
üé∂baby shark, do do do dooo...üéµ
---
TFW you had stockpiled crucible bounties but then Solstice of Heroes dropped
---
The vendor items are 25 shards (maybe 30). Fated engram is 97. 
---
If you wasted 1/4 of your shards buying the vendor merciless that means you spent 25/100 and had 75 left. How did you buy the fated?
---
Imagine, thundercash titan holding both sentinel shied and hammer come at you what would you do.
---
Are u here to read a destiny post or correct my writting?
---
Oh my god! Have I just been blinded by the honest TRUTH?
---
Thats gonna look insane
---
Yeah, cus borderlands 3 is such a mess rn
---
We are a bunch of OP god slayers by this point.
---
The only one that can reliably stop us is the Architect.
---
That was me today, it was my last reset. You‚Äôll get there in no time, good luck!
---
Holy smoke, that looks sick.
---
But the real question remains... 
---
Will it shoot tainted slugs?
---
What does this mean?
---
Oh no you didn't! Love it!!!
---
It seems like a lot but if you just keep working for the reset before the end of the season it‚Äôll be alright! Honestly I did the banking of 75 motes by accident while trying to do something else! It‚Äôll happen good luck future Dredgen :D
---
Hell yeah dude!
---
Oh stop lol just stop please
---
Lol I did the exact same thing earlier today, sorry guardian.
---
That‚Äôs sick
---
That‚Äôs a real titan move right there
---
Ha, got that as well.
---
and how would you change them?
---
Byf gives no fucks about those rules. He just wants his homies to have a good time T.T
---
You're worried about titans becoming a dying breed when titans were op in d1 because you could have weapons of light on your bubble. Now in d2 you will be able to have helm of saint 14 on and be able to: blind enemies who enter, give a blessing of light-esque buff, give armor of light AND give weapons of light which is STRONGER than well. You think Titans are going to die?? (Btw well will not stack with weapons of light). The only way to make half the weapons in the game viable is to either make their DPS insane or take the handicap that weapons are supposed to have in their reload speed and actually make it count.
---
 Nah this guy is funny.
---
Twice for me in the past couple weeks. Got Borealis from world drop, then he started selling it the next friday. Got Lord of wolf from a heroic adventure 3 days ago, now he's selling it *again*.
---
so reporting?
---
Maybe you missed it but Spectral was already hit with a DR nerf and was the template everything else was brought after.  It got its nerf 8 months ago and while I still find it (and roaming supers in general) annoying, it is not dominating now.
---
Xur was selling Lion Rampant, me being half awake decided to buy the fated engram before the boots he was selling, and I got what was basically a waste of a fated engram, cause I was dumb.
---
Jez and Datto, my two favorite destiny youtubers
---
Do the lost sector near Ana Bray on Mars for everything. The Machine Gun frame requires like 25 yellow bar kills. Right now is the perfect time to head to Mars because people are running Escalation Protocol. Tons of yellow bars spawn. 
---
Easiest frame for me is the Hand Cannon. In one trip through the Lost Sector you can get your precision kills and the boss. Then run out and straight back to the boss. During EP the yellow bars also drop the stuff you need for boss kills.
---
I pop blade barrage and get motion sickness while my huntress gracefully twirls through the air
---
WHAT IS UP GUYS
---
RICK
---
KACKIIIS HERE
---
It reloads your currently equipped weapon, its not terrible for PvE but honestly I've never used it enough to know if its any melee damage or only Melee skills.
---
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs an appropriate analogy here. Either way, it sounds like your enjoyment of the game is dictated by what other players have and how they get it.
---
There‚Äôs nothing wrong with options. If player 1 can get something one way and player 2 can get something another way and it‚Äôs done in a way that balances the reward(s) against challenge and time invest, they can BOTH enjoy the experience and go for thing by playing what and how they enjoy the game. The key word here would be ENJOY. This isn‚Äôt work. Or a life lesson. This is a video game. It‚Äôs entertainment.
---
Guardians....  assemble!
---
I think the main perk is perfectly fine it's just most people dont use it because hand cannons kinda suck in pvp so maybe precision hit damage multiplier
---
Winter's guile and nezarecs sin are exotics I run pretty often actually. One-two-punch with winter's guile buff is insane. Try Fighting Lion (a gun I have 60k+ kills with in PvE and PvP) with nezarecs sin and you have all of your abilities up all the time pretty much (exaggerated somewhat). After Lunafaction boots are nerfed us warlocks will be able to use either one of these and not get yelled at for it. I seriously think I'll be using these 2 specifically. Either them or geomag for the insane dps
---
I really enjoy it, but I also really enjoy my Bygones. Either one two taps folks which is decent in my opinion.
---
Same exotic too??
---
‚ÄúWhat is that to you, who have slain gods in the heart of the Black Garden‚Äù
---
That Foetracer buff is way too strong for PvP and so is Wormhusk. Theres a reason that Wormhusk got nerfed. It's still viable and it was run 100% of the time when it ruled the crucible. With TTKs being significantly faster I could see it not being an issue but it would still require an extra headshot or 2 from even a hand cannon.
---
Y‚Äôknow what? I think you may be a bit more unlucky.
---
They are free right now if you already own the base game. 
---
The base game isn't free, which means people who don't own it cannot play CoO and Warmind for free until the game itself is free, if that makes sense.
---
They are free, the other commenter was misinformed.
---
I‚Äôm still trying to find the digital one and this guy goes and actually makes one himself. 
---
You got hutzpah, OP.
---
Functionally, 750 is the new 10 (you are power level 10 at the very start of the campaign, there isn't actually a 1), yet I guess it was easier for them to have everyone be 750.
---
Whether we wanted it or not, we‚Äôve stepped into a war with the Hive on Mars. So let‚Äôs get to clapping their cheeks one by one. Nokris . From what I can gather, he commands the thiccest knights around from a hole on the ground just outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through that bootyhole, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold.
---
I am a warlock main, hunter secondary..
---
And i use hand cannons or pulses paired with shotguns. Till they give us another efficient close quarters weapon in crucible ( secondary swords?) Ill use it to kill rushers
---
You know what it is? It all comes down to fashion. 80 percent of players play a female hunter. They look sexy ngl I have one too. They want to look good but when they get killed by a fast moving dump truck with wall hacks then boom 
---
‚ÄúOMG TITANS ARE SOOOOOO OP AND UGLY REE..‚Äù
---
Did you check to see if Shaxx had two pages of inventory?
---
Yes
---
Now he has none and no pursuits
---
I go back to d1 occasionally and it can be rough not having new qol stuff like mantling. Still love the game though
---
No.
---
Read the rules before posting.
---
Okay..... it‚Äôs a video game if you don‚Äôt like something no one is forcing you to do it.
---
Or, y'know... reddit where he got a lot of the stuff for that video.
---
I got really good rng and got it my first run. My friend was there with the nightfall part of truth quest (do 3 nightfalls) and I thought he‚Äôd be helping me,  or the other way around. But it all came back to me in EP, the stupid fucking submachine gun wont drop and it‚Äôs literally the last gun I need before wayfarer.
---
With this you no longer need to hold the grip, which means 
---
#TWO MOUNTAINTOPS
---
Whenever I played with friends and they talked to spider, I ALWAYS did this. They couldn't figure out what happened when they exited his menu
---
It's the first mission in Forsaken
---
I amü•∞
---
Yep
---
I saw the patch notes.... I was pissed ngl even pre nerf you had to be tactical so
---
It‚Äôs freaking the wolves in zootoopia starting a howl
---
I randomly found one of Jez Nut Shell videos like a year and a half ago and his Monotone Complainy Guy bit had me cry laughing.
---
You have my respect.
---
yeah, It's just weird that it did it on the weapon preview though.
---

---
Nobody cares enough about this post to bother looking at your account stats. Everyone is just going to assume you are bad and move on due to the manner in which you approached this subject.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôve always wanted Saint-14, and I made a poor decision while being half asleep lol
---
I understood that reference
---
As much as I‚Äôd personally love the first part of the Oathkeepers buff/fix, if bow damage was instead upped they‚Äôd need to be very careful otherwise you could be at a point in PvP where bows 1 tap on a crit (which paired with some others perks could lead to exotic level damage)
---
I‚Äôm just happy I can Shadow shot and know if I hit someone it will kill them and not just give them ‚Äúmerely a flesh wound‚Äù
---
Have they fixed it‚Äôs hit box to not be the same size as every other sparrow??? üò±
---
Classic warframe
---
Xur has sold OEM a ton in the past 2 months at least 3 times
---
It will be done, my Commander.
---
MY DUUUDE!!! I BEEN USING THIS FOR MONTHS I NEVER KNEW ANYONE ELSE USED THIS LOADOUT!!! CULTURE!!
---
If you're dying to shotguns enough for it to be a problem you're one with low skill
---
So should I buy forsaken now and shadow keep pre order
---
Im very sorry I was distracted by the "warlock" next to your name...
---
That‚Äôs something a low skilled shotgunner would say.
---
Holy fuck this also happend to me last night, I was already frustrated playing comp this just made my night a lot worse
---
Ok I think it‚Äôs time to dust the graviton Lance off.
---
Yeah. With shotgun you have get close to enemy. Most people can't do even that (like me) in crucible.
---
Remains me of spyro the dragon
---
How much to reroll it?
---
Cap held back actually so Thor wouldn't be upset.
---
Dump question but is this Thorn ?
---
Basically gives you outlaw without have to score a kill
---
You play it on battle net until it's on steam..... I don't know what the problem is.
---
Damn that was sweet. Gotta love it when they group up for you :)
---
You really need to read stuff bungie posts about the future of destiny. To start, EVERY super is getting a damage resist reduction and masterworked armor will no longer add to that resistance. They are changing comp to 2 playlists, a solo que playlist and a normal comp one as well as comp will be 3v3. Orbs and super generation is being reduced all around. 
---

https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48124
---
I never installed it and they removed the page. That's the problem.
---
I'm pretty sure D2 will get a similar treatment when "Age of triumph" arrives. Age of triumph update at the end of D1 basically scaled all raids up to 400 (max) and gave every encounter challenges. Completing 1 challenge rewarded you with an ornament you could use to create effects on your armor.
---
Not sure how they are going to handle that with soon 7 raids in the game. Holy shit that's a lot.
---
Where did you get the gun from i.e. random drop or mission completed i.e like want give
---
Bungo u good
---
And sweet business still gets ignored. It's still stuck in Year1.
---
Bruh you might have screwed yourself out of the way. Good news is that Destiny 2 new light is coming out. #freedestiny. What you could try is to go to bungie net and see if it will let you transfer your blizzard account with Destiny 2 to steam. Might be worth a shot.
---
## bruh üò°üò§üòéüòéüí™
---
I understand that and it's a really good point because it punishes you for being good and that couldn't definitely be an avenue for change...maybe the wearer should select a target and if they get the kill them they get the perk
---
I normally counter with a tether but i had enough of it not activating fast enough so i swapped to this loadout and it was very fun
---
Maybe if you shoot twice with Anarchy, fire a shot with Loaded Question, switch to a shotgun, shoot some shots and then repeat when the first anarchy shots explode you‚Äôll be able to do it.
---
Thanks
---
Handheld super nova is a big one for me too, i can live with panic supers because a good player won't progress if they play like that but handheld is a get out of a tight situation for free card that annoys me because no one else has a cooldown like that...even shoulder charge needs momentum to charge but that can be done in a static position

if it works it works it works... I only really play bottom tree arc strider (when I'm on my hunter). Paired with sixth coyote, and full paragon mods, it's actually both really fun *and* it can compete, at least in neutral game. People honestly tend to underestimate the power of dr. But in the end, the super is lacking, comparatively.
---
It‚Äôs real but not till 9/17.  If you buy forsaken then, you get the AP for free.  That‚Äôs mainly because new light which is F2P will have most of Forsaken Y2 AP stuff for free anyway.
---
But the exotic allows you hold that supernova for ages allowing you to use it the moment a game starts and just find two people, dude I am not going to lie, for sure titans are a good crucible option but I think warlocks are insane, if you can get blink down you are actually lethal with a retold tale, also warlock skating and Icarus dash with dawnblsde makes you easily as strong as bottom tree striker, don't give up on the warlock just yet
---
it might get added back since Taniks was spotted in the trailer
---
Yeah i mean the most fun pvp super is goldie with nighthawk the shutdowns are insane
---
HELL YE BLACKSMITHING, i aughta do something from destiny in the future once i get better at it.
---
Are we on about the same game, dawnblade and warlock skating are both mad even with a nerf the rate of fire and movement of dawnblade means you can kill an entire team at a flag run to c and kill the Respawn
---
Yeah Peter Dinklage really set the danger urgency
---
Hahahaha I like it, but my titans is like a younger zavala with the attitude of Saladin and I look damn fine but I gotta give it to hunters for a 10/10 edgy look
---
Just add some arc electricity, and then we talking
---
I really, really, dont like Gambit, but its title is what I'm closest to complete.
---
You get it by doing the prophecys of osiris on mercury and if you complete them all you get sagiras shell its not a bad weapon its a 180 and hits hard it 3 taps in pvp
---
Well since you stated yourself that you are not a pvp player.... maybe you should just shut up.
---
No they were down for some people
---
Radio static
---
"Commander Zavala... On your left" .
---
Osiris portals start opening.
---
*Queen's Oracle starts ramping up*
---
Oh ok
---
no i'm pretty sure with the catalyst it's more
---
yeah, sucks. I was so happy when I got it until it was shortly nerfed after that and I havent used it since.
---
Explanation?
---
Yeah... I know, it sucks. My mate always gets them and I don‚Äôt lol
---
I personally didn't know anything about this challenge until I happened to see a post about it yesterday.
---
A lot of people don‚Äôt know about these sites. I think most people are relying on the updates from bungie to know how the challenge is going.
---
He dead
---
Of course you manage to find my post...

I believe you have misspelled something.

---
So the 10 runs I did solo on Xol does not matter. (RIP)
---
is this a crosspost of Captain Tsubasa and Destiny?
---
never thought I‚Äôd see the day
---
Menagerie exclusive can roll with trench barrel.    Imagine a gun with 1-2 punch and trench barrel. Oh god.
---
Very epic
---
Titan wall blocks bullets. If you want it to also heal use titan bubble which is being given back weapons of light.
---
Honestly I feel like they should‚Äôve been tweeting daily updates especially since they offered an additional Menagerie reward if we completed the Mars challenge before reset today.
---
Also my thoughts while I'm at work for mandatory overtime. We're not hitting numbers.
---
The idea is to always buy the cheaper and clearly defined offerings first, so that they are all in your collections, then get the engram since it will only provide something you don't have.
---
They have been tweeting daily updates.
---
Titans currently are said to be very good for pvp due to infinite armour and time roaming supers and bad in PvE because they don‚Äôt have an essential ability.   
---
However when Shadowkeep drops, roaming supers are being nerfed and titans are getting weapons of light back for bubble.
---
In conclusion, don‚Äôt read guides, look at meta or listen to other people. Watch gameplay of the class if you want or just choose on the spot.
---
Remember [Zavala plays Warlock](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/cs877x/zavala_plays_warlock/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)

The burning from sunspots trigger the Commander‚Äôs detonators for every tick.

That‚Äôs definitely fair.  Not your fault.

Loaded question will also not be as good for his dps tho because you‚Äôll only get 1 reservoir burst shot at a time

Please remove yourself

Starting with new light all players will have all of their gear automatically at 750 power level(the current Max power right now, but not once shadow keep launches)
---
You will climb in power level throughout the season just like anyone else but power level only matters for the new content(which in our case will be shadowkeep)
---
The game is NOT going entirely f2p. There are still optional dlc that you can buy. Huge portions, even most of the game is becoming f2p, but not all of it.
---
From the twitter link I posted:
---
Free - Everything Year 1 + Year 2 except Raids, Dungeons, Exotic Quests, and Campaign.
---
Forsaken - Everything Year 1 + Year 2.
---
Shadowkeep - Everything Shadowkeep + Current season.
---
Shadowkeep DD - Everything Year 3.
---
--------------------------------------------:------------
---
It's just easier to say what you DONT get from New Light than what you do.
---
Don't get Shadowkeep &amp; Season Passes, Forsaken Raids, Shattered Throne, Y2 Annual Pass Exotic Quests, Forsaken Campaign.
---
----------------------------------------------------------------
---
Y2 activities like Reckoning, Forges and Menagerie are available for new light members.
---
The only thing kinda up in the air now, is whether the forsaken subclasses are part of new light or not.
---
You should aim for completing available campaigns first, then move on to try new activities. From there just focus on doing what you have fun doing.
---
My favorite place to land too!
---
Nightmare fuel
---
How you gunna hit me in the feels like that first thing in the morning?
---
Oh I know.  It's just not as rewarding since they fixed the chest glitch.  Feelsbadman
---
Finally a lane where my scout rifle can outshoot a blast furnace
---
Feels amazing every time. I get that excited grin that Doomguy gets when he picks up a new gun in Doom II.
---
Oof
---
I‚Äôm an admin in a pretty large clan (85) called purple ball guild- not on rn but I will invite you
---
It‚Äôs actually a lot of fun and it feels amazing when you finally do it
---
I am the only one that repeats the Drifter dialogue when it happens?...
---
Raids are their own self contained activities. All players who have access to raids have the exact same chances of getting all the same loot. It isn't based on progress in other parts of the game.
---
It reeks of Hunter elitists ü§¢
---
Honestly. I am a hunter elitist lol
---
Trasnamtting guardians appear out of nowhere. Lord Shaxx is on the battle field with the Mountaintop in his hands and Raze Lighter on his back. Titans blazing with the glory of a sunbreaker, warlocks with solar light eminating from their lunafaction boots, and hunters ready to ring out their golden guns with one shot to end even the toughest of bosses. 
---
This was going to be a battle bigger than twilight gap. Then the first shot rang out.
---
You are absolutely right! Various classes have some strengths and weaknesses over others (hunters having the highest boss DPS super ability, for example), but all three classes are totally viable for everything in the game.
---
Thats not how it works in the console world my man ü§£ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Send me ur gt and I can hit you up

Did you know that you can just walk into the grav lift which will slowly and gently lower to to the ground?

my bad bro, didn‚Äôt use a comma lmao

Ep bosses were completed yesterday but thanks for contributing anyway ^-^

I'm glad xur pulled through for you, he literally cucked me and gave me every single exotic armor piece in his pool EXCEPT skull of dire ahamkara til after the nerf and I literally had everything in his loot pool up till that point

Once around the middle of a match we had an invader with sleeper stimulant who immediately killed me. A couple seconds later a blueberry teammate came to revive me. You would think he would die very quickly (while my cries of NO BUDDY, YOU DO NOT WANT TO STAND THERE went unheard), but no, the invader let him revive me and then took both of us out with one shot the moment I revived.
---
I never knew...this is amazing!

I don't believe there's another way.

There are a lot of variables to this comment such as power levels and what enemy you‚Äôre fighting. Because when kill clip is active on my pillager, I literally can‚Äôt see much of a difference

Osiris, your simulation just bugged out. Might want to run debug on this sector.

It'll be a new set, it was different last year.

Xur can sell these sword modifiers for Nightfalls. The more the modifiers heavily impact your gameplay add more multipliers which can help you reach a higher score. If you want one and wish to check it out, he‚Äôs on the Winding Cove in the EDZ towards the back on a cliff and you‚Äôll find him.
---
I hope to make my own playlist like this with promethean's (and my) uploads someday. Although I'm not a fan of Bungie's soundtrack versions, I doesn't make me love the music any less.
---
No, the only 1-2 punch shotguns are Last Man Standing, from Rekoning and GP, and the CoS raid shotgun's curated roll, which mostly drops from the first encounter and the jump puzzle.
---
FINISHED!
---
Technically not true. Anyone can kill a hunter or warlock that BB/NB themselves into a wall
---
amazing.
---
Unless you don't have new ones to get, or your missing exotics are post forsaken.
---
finally! been trying to reach you for years!
---
I'd expect this once Shadowkeep comes out but we can only hope until then. Siriks, Loyal to Eramis is one of Pieter's best cues.
---
These d1 posts hurt my heart, I need armor like this again :(
---
You get access to all year 1 content, every crucible map, every strike (Though only in the playlist, can't select them individually), regular gambit and are allowed to explore all the patrol zones and do bounties in them. You also get to play the first mission of Shadowkeep, all for free come October 1st.
---
No, if you need it for. MMXIX, you are too late.
---
I don't know about that one chief.
---
Nope, nopenopenope. You don't get to do that. The marketing says "Free to play". It is not classed as free to try.
---
I have a 5 of Swords challenge card already
---
Well I‚Äôm sure that if you slap an element singe of your choosing with a couple modifiers of your choice, then you‚Äôd should be good to go.
---
Sniper and SMG is what I run as well. Kinetic SMG for the vast majority of fodder and energy sniper for shield popping, heavy damage, and range on the off chance I really need to. Point here is that most players opt for the energy snipers over kinetic snipers. They're unbeatable when it comes to shield popping.
---
Because Redbull gives you wings
---
I one tapped someone in IB with my Duke and at first I was like wtf buffs did I have? Then I saw it was a level 30 with like 380 light, I guess they didn't realized light level mattered
---
You can‚Äôt get liars from fated engram, it‚Äôs to recent.
---
If you buy shadowkeep all characters get bumped to 750 so you can play immediately. 
---
If you're not buying, might as well grind it for "content".
---
My question is how do I know I‚Äôve done enough to be a part of the rewards
---
If you did a nightfall you will get the emblem. I think everyone gets extra stuff from menagerie

There's this awesome section in the menus called audio - you should take some time to get acquainted.
---
Nothing so far has indicated that this is true.
---
Wait untill October 1, the you'll only have to buy forsaken, because the y2 annual pass will be included with forsaken
---
This happens to all players, regardless of who owns Shadowkeep or not.

To add on to this: I've see it rumored that Cap couldn't lift the Hammer then because he was still carrying the secret about how Tony's parents died, so until he confessed that he wasn't worthy.
---
I second this.
---
Sadly cant help you out being an xbox player myself
---
Doesn‚Äôt have to be 100k from what I know, emblem will go to qualified players on weekly reset (a.k.a when the challenge ends)
---
He has i high kd and likes to trash talk, but point well taken ill bring it down, after about 5 more minutes
---
Lol, I bought PS4 d2 a month aftwr it came out, and haven't played it much until I bought forsaken a week ago. I know how you feel. What are you wanting to do? I always need nightfall buddies, so hmu if you want
---
Damn
---
Its the term youtubers use so I‚Äôm sticking with it
---
If you've already gotten one that way you can't get another.   If you haven't, it's random and can take awhile.
---
You have no clue what rng is huh. Random Numbers Generator, and it has nothing to do with bullets you are shooting. The other guy in the conversation is 100% correct
---
You cant argue with a reasonable man. Ill bring it down in about 3 more minutes
---
So you tell me, if I hipfire a sniper, what determines where the bullet goes?
---
I don't think this is going to happen. It's why I don't like them releasing music through Bungie Rewards. There's no way to get the Whisper music in FLAC, it's not on Spotify or iTunes, or any of those. It was a marketing release only for Forsaken and the AP music is likely the same way which means, don't expect this ANY time soon.
---
The forges are lit! Ada-1 calls for aid!
---
Lol your AIM! And the help of AIM ASSIST if you are playing console
---
RNG refers to the randomness of loot drops dude
---
\*\*Looks up\*\*
---
244 fps, nice
---
Do first encounter of the last wish And you should get it . Lots of people running last wish rn to prep for shadowkeep , You will find a team . DM me of you are on PC I can try help ya .
---
Random number generation is a program controlling item drop rarity bullet spread cones are entirely different
---
No watch fallout plays he explains this all
---
You see the direction he's aiming down? Just keep heading in that direction.
---
Yet when hip firing you aren‚Äôt exactly pin point aiming because the reticle is wide so what determines the location the bullet goes?
---
Things like hitscan for example
---
Until Shadowkeep... :(
---
There should be a orange color mission on the EDZ. I think its a little above the "sniper guy".
---
Hitscan and projectile ballistics
---
#bloom
---
Everyone's items spontaneously become 750. That is how it will work.
---
Shadowkeep doesn't not include a character boost.
---
Whwn it releases along with New Light, everyone's characters and every item they own goes to 750 automatically.
---
i was bored i was just looking at radom vid and find this shit
---
Why are you using this sub to specifically target someone and call them an idiot? So childish... and really unrelated
---
Looks to me like targeted advertising, shame shame
---
Alright, reading text can be tough, as you usually read it with a tone based on your mood, so sorry! Sounds good.
---
You have snap shot on it so I would recommend full choke if you ads (which you should) you will map with it.
---
It's so silly. I was taking down a heavy blocker with a teammate today, then two captains showed up and everyone split. They didn't even have any motes to lose if they died!
---
im just like wtf is this
---
The range nerf leaves it mostly unaffected in pve, because you can just walk a little closer to the enemies. I don't know how it fares in pvp, though.
---
Not like it was
---
If you use the release the wolves perk then yes, without the perk it‚Äôs still decent.
---
This looks like the scene from avengers infinity war where the guardians of the galaxy are in hyperspace going to where the asgardian ship was destroyed
---
It would be cool to see that as an enemy type with the glowing eyes and maybe thick black smoke surrounding them. I dunno kinda sounds cool to me
---
Have you done it if you don't have done it add me on psn:GODfries14
