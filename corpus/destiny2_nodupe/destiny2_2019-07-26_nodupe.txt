Not a smart thing to say mate. A little bit of maturity goes a long way

---
I did lol, thanks for the suggestion. Destiny 2 is dwindling anyway, and for good reason. Enjoy your dying game.
---
Tbh they‚Äôre not that hard, but congrats
---
Yep and the glows have their own perks
---
Emo is literally the last thing I'd describe this sparrow as
---
I use a bow just for fun factor in both lol my teammates probably get rattled but I do pretty well. OEM shotgun apes are the bane of my existence. But I can respect people wanting to do good in those game modes so I understand abusing the meta. Even though it makes me want to throw my Xbox out the window.
---
Something's wrong with you.
---
please elaborate
---
I dig ur energy
---
what is this in reference to? I was saying OP was probably talking about how they needed Bergusia night shader hence the curated drop, not the refurbished shader.
---
Ana Bray is S class for sure. Amanda is top A class.
---
i disagree a lot
---
It is indeed YouTube
---
Look at those Amazon Echos
---
That's enough to make you quit? You honestly think it's better for a company to sell a "complete" game with a pricetag of over $100, that has less interactivity, is far more simple minded, doing almost the exact same thing every mission, and draws heavily from a game released way prior than to not have a manual block? I mean, to each their own I guess lol. I'm surprised Warframe hasn't sued honestly, probably because they can't compete with all that AAA money since they don't MAKE you pay for ANYTHING in the game; whereas Destiny makes you pay for everything.
---
I relate to this so much I always felt like I‚Äôm the only one who actually enjoys bows in PvP

This little girl looks more ready for a raid than most of my clanmates are.

Best comment I've ever seen.

... I was a Melee main, Aerial guarding was *CRUCIAL*
---
Naw, I was playing... I think almost 400 lol, haven't done Forsaken yet and I'm in the process of Warmind I think it is.

I like you, you're a great example of how people who support something should act. This mentality you have, can actually change people's minds. Keep doing it. The whole, you don't like it then leave thing is equatable to THIS IS MURIKA, YOU DON'T LIKE IT YOU CAN GIT GONE.
---
Wait so every time we revived our Ghost is actually just pulling a *different us* from another reality?
---
"BB only good in pve" holy shit , neanderthals still exist everybody üòÇ hammers don't track unless they're close as shit. I didn't say Titan supers were completely useless , but they're definitely designed around pve more than hunters are . I have saved clips of my spectral blades hunter wiping a team, getting back across the map and getting another half the team. It just depends on what system you play on. Seeing as you're a ps4 Pleb, I understand why you are griping. You live an inferior pvp experience constantly on a system overflooded with Hunter mains like yourself who are literally just DPS bots üòÇ crocodile tears at their finest

From Bungie - To qualify for the ‚ÄúPrismatic Inferno‚Äù emblem, players must have finished a Crucible match between 10 AM PST December 8 and 10 AM PST December 12 2017.
---
You have a chance to get it from Xur‚Äôs fated engram tomorrow too.
---
I would say there is not much reason to keep playing for you but if you get a little extra cash def buy the DLC
---
Also you can literally not even try with golden gun üòÇ it has one of the highest aim assist procs in the game because bungo knows bitch ass kids like yourself play hunters and would rage so hard they pop a blood vessel if they didn't üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

Infinite cosmic power itty bitty sparrow
---
I actually really like his videos... not sure why people hate on him so much...
---
All the things I'm staying are the reason they're nerfing anyways üòÇ the developer has and will always have the best opinion of what to do with THEIR game. If you wanna rage about your own personal idea of balance go make your own mass multiplayer shooter looter ya twat
---
You can see all your previous crucible games on bungie.net
---
Yeah, we should. I believe it is the same glitch anteaus wards suffered from
---
None. I mean some are better but you can do every end game activity without them. Some better ones are mountaintop, recluse, austringer, Luna‚Äôs, ikelos shotgun etc
---
If you are having fun, you should keep playing. If you are no longer having fun, you should not keep playing.

I got it:) and I love it! I‚Äôm at 17% still a long way to go but I‚Äôm going.

Have any other fun recommendations that are good as well? (Aside from hand cannons)

This post made me lol out loud rofl copter

Rick kackis is a YouTube streamer...people are always making play on words with his name ...

See that mountain? You can go to it.

Does this on pc too with kbm, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the controller

Maybe they're just making fun of his intro, although I do see complaints about his video length

Yes yes you are

Go to the Bungie forums and post in Help - Game Issues.
---
They were dumb staggering against a titan with its super ready.
---
Brooo imagine the crucible matches that took place during the taking of the traveller
---
Sorry but how ?
---
?
---
Thats ok fusions in general right now are op. I was sniping earlier with entril.
---
Kuzko's poison. The poison meant for kuzko. Specifically made to kill only kuzko.
---
Close, but no. This is the Shattered Throne entrance room. It will be back in two weeks.
---
It's something to do with completed bounties creating errors. If it happens , head to you triumphs page and clear all the completed ones/look at the page, and it should clear the issue.
---
I've had the same issue for the last week and a bit, invisible character issues can also be fixed by this.
---
oH my mistake it looks too similar sorry
---
When did destiny get rocket league achievements...
---
Umm, wrong game?
---
Thank you!!!!
---
I can confirm that this problem is fixed by turning in bounties. Whenever you have a completed bounty just hanging around and then change areas - even at the tower or in open patrol - it will not always load. If you are stuck, check bounties. For whatever reason, when you complete a bounty it does not register until the activity is complete or until you open your pursuits.
---
So the quest, duh
---
When? And how?
---
Literally just use a consumable and you‚Äôll spawn back in
---

Sorry about the spamming of this video. The other uploads didn't tell me if they worked or not.. I believe I have deleted the spares but I will double-check tomorrow to be sure.

I think it should be a one shot or near one shot
---
How big is your 3D Printer?!

you won't have an issue. I have a 144hz and GTX 1070. I get more frames in crucible clocking in at around 110-140

---
It isn't, the knife throw is pretty useless but I try to use it whenever I can find an excuse
---
IKR? A shoulder charge is a one hit kill for running and hitting one button. Knives have to be aimed and times, why is that not worth more?
---
I expect she's probably got lots of questions about the world, an abundance of emotions, and it's likely that any skillsets she's got aren't well developed. So she probably works in the sense that any young girl does.
---
On high settings? Or u got them optimized?
---
I‚Äôve been playing on console since D1 before destiny was available to PC, and I really haven‚Äôt gone out of my way to buy a PC when it did become available because I didn‚Äôt want to start all over. But with cross save coming soon, I may buy one.
---
That‚Äôs how strikes has always worked.  
---
 I can solo queue and get 750s
---
She queues and gets 690s
---
We queue we get 690s.  
---
And the issue is 690s still get whopped.  Light level increases to 700 on enemies.  That‚Äôs the issue.  You‚Äôll spend 2-3 hours getting minimal progress per activity because everyone dies instantly and can‚Äôt to adequate boss damage
---
Its a super its not really supposed to be combated easily, in my opinion. Instead of nerfing everything buff some of the other supers and make them actually contenders or make small nerfs to time but please for the love of Destiny 2 don't just throw into the toilet
---
high settings yea. not the highest but a step below looks beautiful and frames are great
---
They haven't really been amazing for me except for knocking of a little bit of health which doesn't do much because by the time i have my gun again im already dead. Knives can be slightly useful in some situations which sucks when warlock and titan melee are easier to use. If you miss a knife throw and the other guy sees you your losing almost a second from readying your gun again which nowadays with the ttk's is a lot. 
---
Id like to see knives be buffed, like increased precision damage or quicker ready speed after a throw to have them equal to the other melees
---
in  other words 0.0119% the size of a football field
---
God roll is really determined by opinion, such as for austringer my god roll is outlaw demolitionist while others say it‚Äôs outlaw rampage or triple tap rampage or maybe even eye of the storm rampage. It‚Äôs mostly opinion but there are a few star perks that are generally wanted on certain guns
---
Because you can build melee very fast and it would be op with select players
---
If it doesn‚Äôt do anything, why do we have it? Shouldn‚Äôt we try to make it better?
---
Since that was so long ago, your best bet is to start playing and find all the new stuff for yourself. Not trying to be rude by any means but neither of us have the time to explain everything that's gone down.
---
you can do it with 5 but 6 is definitely close to necessary
---
You‚Äôre right, players with perfect aim would destroy  those without it. But does that justify the knife being useless? What could we do to fix the original problem?
---
Idk why it exists at this point, I would sell my soul for better knives
---
God damn it how many raids did it take I'm on 30.
---
Downdoot because it triggered my ptsd
---
A god roll for pvp is usually the following, outlaw, killclip, rampage, feeding frenzy, range finder and slideshot. For pve it would be outlaw, rampage, 1-2 punch, feeding frenzy, kill clip, multi killclip and a few others
---
Knives are cool but being useful is better
---
It‚Äôs kinda like thorn but a melee because it‚Äôs main use IMO is to stop healing while still being able to engage. If it had more aim assist it would make it better somewhat and the burn should kill people
---
I could drain your sweat into a fucking gallon.
---
I want them to actually be useful. I feel like if I have a hand cannon equipped and throw a knife, I‚Äôm eating my own time. Never been a moment where I feel like throwing knives (apart from blade barrage) was a better choice
---
It cant oneshot body shot a *shadow* *thrall, the weakest enemy in the game*
---
Its damage always felt lackluster compared to every other HC since warminds explosive round nerf, crimson being the only worst HC in the sandbox since Forsaken, it feels like a heavy pea shooter, the mag size certainly doesn't help, as does the "exotic" perk, which is literally just explosive rounds
---
The gun isnt perfectly good anywhere but stability , feel and range (If using catalyst), but its damage, mag size, and lack of an actual unique exotic perk make it at most a glorified legendary if not a oxygen SR3 level pinnacle
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
seriously who uses sunshot in any endgame content? I see bad juju, recluse and outbreak all the time but never sunshot, and if there is one duded running it in a raid or heroic menagerie they switch off and regret using it in the first place since the gun is nothing short but a fun handicap
---
I don't know whether to be terrified or impressed. I hope I don't ever run into you. But if I do, let's hope you're on my side.
---
Yea but what about  b a b y  sparrow
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs only normal gambit, could be wrong though but I would play normal gambit just to be safe
---
Spectral got nerfed and i see mo difference between FoH and pre nerf spectral.
---
That time when the Crucible was hilariously fun? Yeah I remember it.
---
I see what you mean! I just feel that a precision tool should be rewarded for being precise, and right now it feels like it does nothing compared to a headshot
---
thats hardlight, then again its screenshake is terrible even on PC
---
Every HC on console has bloom and trash recoil, sunshot has that and mag/damage/lack of an actual exotic perk issues
---
Go on Ishtar, pick a gun and look at its perk pool. Pick one perk in each column that you‚Äôd want on that gun, no other perk would suffice. That is your god roll.
---
which guy? the one capping the obj. or the moron who supers one dude?
---
Yes very stressful, I didn‚Äôt even want to look at my score
---
Record I saw was in riven banner guy got it up to the floating spear. You had to climb on top of a nearby rock and triple jump to get to it
---
Its only half the video. That's all it would allow. ....And I had 25 kills thank you. Look at the score board. üò§üí™üèæ
---
It is defently a sweet ass setup. It's just something about all the holes on the mouse make me feel uncomfortably aggrivated.
---
Today is the day! Thanks!
---
Oh, well I thought you were showing something rare or something. Weird flex but ok.
---
I no shit thought it was bedazzled as I was scrolling by
---
I played D1 but was only casual, never did nightfalls or raids, were they that much worse?
---
The knife isnt slow travel time wise  and its best in skilled players hands, after a while of using it aiming w it will become instinct and youll just know from memory what height to throw it at
---
Well, sounds like yes, considering how you played within the required timeframe. Congrats :)
---
It's 120
---
Aaaaayyy! I discovered that area organically and abused the shit out of it.
---
Yeah the meme barely fits here though. I think he‚Äôs trying too hard
---
Thanks guys. I understand now. I always thought that when they said god roll it was when they had the best perks hands down nobodies opinions mattered lol. 
---
I‚Äôve always just played with what worked best for me. 
---
I love the Calus mini tool. I‚Äôm not sure if other people like it much but I can‚Äôt get the recluse lol.

U less things have changed doesnt ur lil fire revolver one shot coulda sworn ive been killed by that a few times

Same. Solo grind was brutal.
---
Service cause 180 is crispy as hell and way more for giving if you miss a shot
---
Yup. What we did at first was have the host hover over the kick button and did the parkour one at a time, screaming kick me if we fell. That‚Äôs all fine and good until the host himself gets flung through portal before morgeth and out into the void. He managed to punch his Xbox before he died, somehow turning it off. He sent a pic to us and it cracked the shell of the Xbox.
---
I like it

Repost with a different title.

Lol the glimmer cap is not high hate to say it. I spend this much in a day and be back at 100k a few hours later.

No He just got killed by low and came here to rant about it, it happens a lot lmao.

If you haven't found it yet it's called Ducky One 2 Mini RGB, I have it in black. You can find them online but I recommend mechanicalkeyboards.com

Why call Microsoft and sony. They make to consoles lmao

This has made me like Nathan Gilion a lot more than before.
---
People say Jotunn is broken. And that Enteril is broken. Pretty much anything they get killed by especially in one shot. But there's  a difference between being truly broken like low is on PC and something maybe needing a nerf or a tweak. It's not even emblem worthy on console.
---
What will you get ? Many more players to match with, and a neat Veteran emblem...
---
I mean, why would you feel screwed ? It's as if you bought a CPU on release for 500$ and regret it 2 years later when it drops to 250$. That's basically how anything goes from a pair of sneakers to a car. 
---
If anything I'm quite happy they make it F2P to refill population, not a single ounce of jealousy whatsoever.
---
The datamine showed it would start on the last week of SoH, which would be the 20th
---
Jotun is annoying not broken I'll agree with you there I die from it once in a blue moon, erentil is busted tbh I've used it myself and it's just too easy and not much you can do about it if the player is smart enough. Most other fusions seem balanced though it's just the highest impact ones are filthy. Got tap the trigger and I can get people 35+ metres away consistently which is insane. It doesn't need "nerfing into the ground" but the possible ranges for fusions need to be adjusted
---
Nice! Good luck getting your next one? What other title are you going for anyways?

The catalyst is a pain to get though

Failsafe is best waifu \^-\^

I've only been playing Destiny 2 for about two days so I don't get the hype.

Hopefully I can get hyped over some stuff.

what.

It be like that sometimes man. Just gotta stay with it

thank you

Nothing better than slaying monkeys in the crucible

Expected you pulling it off without a super, well still not disappointed. Great play.

I did the same. It was not fun, but the Recluse is now one of my favorite guns in both PvP and PvE

I gave up on Dredgen, since january stuck on Deposit 100 motes without dying and win the match

I was more along the line of looking for someone to be friends with cause since I‚Äôve moved I haven‚Äôt had much luck. But I‚Äôm sure if I go to r/fireteams someone will be friends with me. I‚Äôm glad they have you to direct the traffic back to their sub. Thanks again guys.

*proceeds to go and kill some people in crucible so i can finally get it done*

that solo queue life

I have nothing to worry about. Thanks, Ryzen 3000.

Agreed. I feel more proud that I solo‚Äôd it than I would have if I found a team on LFG.

that‚Äôs exactly what a * m o o n s  h a u n t e d* would say
---
Are you my squadmate? I detest EOM. We also ran into a six stack of titan apes. Fuckers ran OEM and LoW and just corner camped like little bitches.

I think all (or most) mods will remain. They'll just change the way they work to the Armor 2.0 system.

But do you have 1,388 Enhancement Cores?

Same, and I too suck at crucible but soloing those 2 weapons were like my biggest achievements in destiny as of yet just so satisfying

Ok thank you I shall save my mod till shadowkeep then

Or because no one uses in game team chat and you just want someone to talk to?

I'm afraid your infos aren't up to date, AMD did send a fix to manufacturers which they pulled a couple days later due to new bugs created that made PCIe regress to 2.0.

I played Trials during Laser Tag.

Apparently it wasn't as big a mistake as I thought it would be.

Same here, I love the rush I get from Gambit. It‚Äôs all about keeping track of invasion portals, helping out your teammates and generally being smart about when to bank motes. I always solo queue and win a decent amout of my games

[How I feel as an arcstrider...](https://youtu.be/HPPj6viIBmU)
---
My first thought as well.
---
I need the runner one, the badge and the kill hvt, for some reason I never get fallen
---
Damn titans.
---
total victory isn't that difficult, easiest way to do it is to have 2 anarchy guys, 1 buff 1 unbuff and 2 phase the deception, 1st phase get him down to ~20%, 2nd phase just have the 2 anarchy guys shoot and break the shields over and over until 5 breaks, then everyone else melt him on the 5th break
---
You forgot the boss stomp
---
Yeah if I could just park right here that'd be great, thanks.
---
Yes. Maybe I will to.
---
Who still uses Luna‚Äôs
---
I‚Äôm just here to kill aliens and find shiny guns.
---
I agree. It‚Äôs my fave thing to do.
---
Skill based matchmaking brings the same problem though, every game becomes a sweat fest when like you said, most people play quick play for low intensity games. Skill based matchmaking isn‚Äôt the solution and it never will be.
---
Icebreaker was the crawl master. I spent whole evenings killing things one. by. one.
---
lmao wut, i got 2500 in one night.
---
I wouldn't worry too much until you hit max level or close to it. 
---
Just fyi the drifter (i believe) has a quest with 690 blue equipment and weapons for every slot which is a nice boost.
---
if you legit believe that ada 1 is better than mara sov we're gonna have beef

Ada-1 is fine china, and Mara Sov is a paper plate.
---
How‚Äôd you get the furtive shell for the collections badge without resets?
---
Oh ight bet,I'll just farm the menagerie
---
Oh no,u have to start a strike playlist first then when u get the strike u do it
---
another console player bits the dust
---
From reading the FAQ I believe the answer to your question is no, you can‚Äôt combine the two accounts or any loot. It does kinda suck but I understand why we can‚Äôt. I wanted to start playing on Xbox but since I can‚Äôt link it with my PC it might not be the best idea.
---
You will just have to choose which account you want to use for cross save.
---
Same here as dont want to drag team down with me trying to get speciific kill types really wish could create a 2nd account give all my weapo s to it and then roll with a team and see what my kda would be
---
Not really. I‚Äôve used LFG for QP just because even bare minimum callouts is better than solo queuing that sweat fest. Makes the game score not look 70-10 lol
---
First day that crotas end came out , got it from the exotic chest in the first encounter with all the thrall , was fucking thrilled after months of no Gally and all my boys taunting tf outta me üíÄ
---
Ah thank you I totally would of just clicked on the strike üòÖ
---
Hopefully you left your console"if you're on console" in an open area with a slight fan blowing towards it.
---
At least a loading screen hint would be nice...I thought it was random too lol
---
Just wait for Gladd to do all of these 2 or 3 manned back to back with no deaths or some crazy crap like that
---
Bro, how much of petra's bathwater can you buy?
---
No problem, if u need help farming it I can help you
---
Should be able to, tokens are redeemed for items right
---
Ah it‚Äôs tempting but I gotta pay the bills somehow
---
The Last Word is not a gun that you should be using while ADS.
---
If you can only use the gun while ADS, use another gun, all its benefits come from hip firing it.
---
Already there (at least in Ishtar that I use)
---
Unpopular Opinion: I hate gambit.
---
I strictly use the hip fire when I‚Äôm getting aped(fully auto) or if I‚Äôm airborne(single shots). Outside of that I ADS.
---
It‚Äôs very situational. If there close (shotgun range) hip fire anything beyond that I usually aim down sights
---
As gambit isn't nearly as bad as the crucible.
---
This says a lot about society.
---
No, you get armor pieces from the quest and every armor piece that you unlock from the quest gets put into the token reward pool.
---
Hip fire imo it‚Äôs more consistent for me. ADS is doable, however requires a lot more pull down from the other stick. I‚Äôm sure some have mastered ADS on console but I‚Äôm not one of them. Not yet at least.
---
Ive only just got the last word about 2 days ago but I prefer hipfire in all honesty. I'm not great with hand cannons in general (even with enhanced targeting) but with last word I'm okay and tend to outgun most of the time with hipfire as apposed to ADS (where I tend to die 9/10)
---
damn alright, i hope this grenade part of the quest gives me the cloak then
---
I can't even clear the 2nd reckoning mission from the Drifter...and I know I am waaaaay behind.
---
This is a first, the game has a huge amount of phenomenal emblems. What are you on?
---
Awesome I found it! Ty
---
Yes. Xbox1 and see it a lot. I have a solid internet connection, as well as having all my ports assigned, static IP, etc.
---
There is 5 steps and each steps gives you once piece. So you are guaranteed the full set by finishing the quest.
---
Catalysts make exotic weapons better, in most cases. They‚Äôre rare enough to the point that getting one to drop takes weeks or months. I got pretty lucky with my drop, since I picked up The Colony recently. Each catalyst has certain requirements to fill out before the weapon is essentially buffed by it. Getting a catalyst is equally as rare as getting a random exotic drop

He's actually a ranked speed killer in destiny. He solos nightfalls by dropping his light level and jacking up the multipliers for practice and for live streams whe he does them. He's one of the best in game on tracker and top 10 for gambit reapers with loads of 1 and only solos in the game. I think you got the wrkn impression. Nobody keeps up with him at what he does.
---
Yeah I have everything for the badge except the shell so when I get one more reset I get the badge and then light vs light
---
Stay away from prime; it's a waste of your time unless you plan on grinding for dredgen. Get its weekly done for the powerful gear n keep it moving. "Light sharpens light guardian", so get all the powerful gear u can to get to 750 asap. Don't re-run things that won't drop powerful gear.
---
Yeah then the badge since the shells the only thing I‚Äôm missing
---
Immediately followed by "OOPS! You left a Gambit match before it was complete."
---
I'm going to try out Ishtar, I was always using the official app.
---
10-14 motes is though, and 15 motes is a knight so yeah.
---
Where can you see these rankings?
---
tuesday is weekly reset
---
Nooo fighting lion just does this
---
It does?
---
It's a loading zone glitch. When you generate an orb from a masterwork weapon right after entering a new area there's a chance it generates a fuckton of orbs
---
Gambit speed kill leaderboard on tracker. They used to show all of pve but after this season only showing gambit now. Him and another guy 2 vs 4 gambit teams also. Dudes a monster. Foreal.
---
Interesting
---
That dab at the end is just the fucking cherry on top
---
Thank you...???
---
Whenever I hear this pop up... My heart skips a beat
---
sometimes on xbox yes but its just your system
---
Actium war rig with sweet business.
---
I played strikes with two guys last night and they were absolutely melting everything, every boss died well before he hit his second stage, it was nasty...and awesome. I've never raided either or gotten the Whisper
---
Hello, I own Destiny 2 with Forsaken, is it worth getting the annual pass for 15 EUR or wait for Steam release?
---
I get that its a console thing but im trying to find out if theres smth wrong with mine xbone...shouldnt be the case i thinn bcs i bought it in December last year
---
i want this on my grave
---
Titan master race.
---
What kind of xbox is it
---
S 1TB
---
gambit is just a lot to handle, most of them cant make it very smooth aside from the one x
---
Literally just got J√∂tunn 15 minutes after I saw this, is this Hive magic?
---
Same, just need 1 more rare bounty and like 40 damn weapon frames haha
---
no
---
They should optimise it but i guess it will never happen
---
just get better hardware if it bothers you that much lol
---
Nope you can get it from collections tho
---
Thing is that it didnt have any lags before,it started like a week ago
---
Console problems
---
"Motes lost: 54"
---
I think he was just happy to get *something* in
---
This might be a n00b question, but am I in need of a fireteam to play Gambit or does it auto-matchmake? I have no Destiny friends besides random users on the /r/fireteams subbredit.
---
Check out r/DestinySherpa
---
Best advice find a clan... i personally thing LFG is toxic and never use it... there are some good people out there unfortunately the majority want to set requirements for people to play with..
---
Ever thought about not having money for it
---
Removed for being a low effort post? Bollocks to that, have an upvote my friend.
---
its not that much more sell yours and save a little not hard to do
---
There's a guy I watch on YouTube who will do free promotion for stuff like this if you wanted to expand and get a few more eyes on your work. He hasn't been doing youtube long but is growing fast because he deserves it for 1 and 2, his contents amazing and he puts a lot thought into it. Just saying if you were looking to network. It's how a lotta ppl gain audience.
---
If on xbox, try the built-in LFG tool.
---
If on PC/PS4, try the companion app, r/fireteams, or one of the many other LFG methods listed at the top of this sub.
---
Like I said there where no public events active at the time of screenshots and I've checked the darkening of the area doesn't make the lamps glow of surfaces
---
no.
---
Oh my bad thank you!
---
It has matchmaking. It‚Äôs fine most of the time, although you get the odd Blueberry here and there that *still* don‚Äôt understand how Gambit works, which can lead to more frustration.
---
1.5 KD will check.
---
Nevermind that a 1.5 true KD (not efficiency) would make you a top 1% player lol.
---
Why not just go for curated emperors curtesy?
---
On Reddit PC you can edit it
---
Playing against low is not fun at all, and feels like cheating. Meanwhile Lasertag was only for a weekend and was a fucking laser gun.
---
Precision kills
---
And its power level lol not light level
---
I hate the new meta because shotgun spam and bottom tree striker titans are rampant in crucible. As a warlock, it‚Äôs forced me to use blink just so I can doge some of the spam.
---
I'm 99.9% sure it does NOT have to be precision kills to get the transponder to drop. OP is asking how to get it to drop.
---
check your triumphs you dont need to use all your materials you can get a large chunk of them tributes done that way
---
I got evreything on day one and spent a fuck load of materials and glimmer. You can use the discounts and save 80% of everything its not that hard.
---
News circulating emblem is tied to p.lens event. Anyone any idea ?
---
Would it be faster? Curated drops aren‚Äôt that common either
---
I feel like they always help
---
I mean I always try to do it, but its not really helpful here as there is no proof that precision kills actually make a difference. You could suggest trying to get precision kills, but trying to correct my statement with just "Precision Kills" is not correct as there is no evidence that precision kills are whats needed to get the item.
---
Please buff the spray and pray/ aim assist Lord please. It sounds cool on paper but TLW is powerful enough as is at least on console.
---
18 isn‚Äôt that bad, and you should probably have one or two from triumphs already
---
If any one else wants help too I can help out on Xbox.  GT: Larrythellama26 feel free to inv or message me anytime after 9pm est

They look so much like one of the chroma legs from D1 when will bungie stop reusing armor designs
---
Gee thanks. No need to be a dick. These were okay the last time I hit LL.
---
He never said its not popular, the main point is people shit on the game without giving it a try, or they gave up on bungie due to the state of the initial release which was complete dog shit. Now its way better and closer to D1 but some people wont give it that second chance.
---
Wow, that was amazing. Goosebumps
---
Tiny keyboard
---
750 if you have all the expansions. Overall lvl50 is the cap.
---
Why did you re-post this?
---
It cost me everything, but I have 4k now.
---
it was blue
---
Trust.
---
Sorry, it‚Äôs just hard for me to get back into it. I got burnt out pretty bad
---
you still get a free long range shotgun ability along with it so chill.
---
Dangit OP I didn‚Äôt join this sub to be inspired!
---
Didn‚Äôt like the title.
---
You realise it is coming back, right???
---
It is.
---
Truth, Black Talon lol

My grandparents router: I was made for HughesNet and I face the same problems as a router from the early 2000s
---
Haha I don't blame you. I just finished getting 21% delirium last night, and I'm 1 triumph away from Dredgen. It's fun if you get matched with good teammates, but otherwise‚Ä¶
---
Where you been mate?
---
0o0
---
69/10
---
Praise the Lord it wasn't Aeon Safe.
---
Aparently I've been living under a rock
---
That‚Äôs part of my problem. It seems like I‚Äôm always matched with guys who have never even played destiny before, let alone gambit lol
---
Make the bayonet usable even if it‚Äôs just as a melee replacement.
---
Thanks for the advice, I work a night shift schedule that has me going to sleep probably around the better time for me to play unfortunately lol
---
^This. Also, check the daily reset thread on /r/DestinyTheGame/
---
LOL
---
&gt; "Confirmed Sunsinger Self Rez in Destiny 2"
---
changed to
---
&gt; "Since when was Sunsinger Self Res in Destiny 2"
---
Quite the change you made there...
---
Yea me too, but it‚Äôs like, I just want it that bad lol
---
‚ÄúThe Phallic Birthright‚Äù
---
üëçgg at the end of the day u use what u want
---
I really want Zhalo Supercell back
---
Bungie confirmed it's a 100% drop chance on first completion after the update.
---
They need to fix the pvp texture glitch... that shit is cancer
---
Leave j√∂tunn out of this
---
I don‚Äôt plan on going back lol. As I said I enjoy Gambit and doing the daily and weekly stuff. It just wasn‚Äôt fun getting destroyed over and over again. It wasn‚Äôt fun or funny. I play other games as well so I don‚Äôt live or die by this one. Thanks for the nice response and not the typical ‚ÄúGit Gud Scrub‚Äù üòÉ

I want the symbols to be centered over each of their heads so badly it hurts.

Me, a Guardian: *dies*

Taken vandal that just killed me: *‚ÄùWait, that‚Äôs illegal.‚Äù*
---
Has this not been fixed yet? I'm building a pc before Shadowkeep comes out and was leaning towards the 3700x
---
Now I know why it takes forever to load my inventory‚Äîmy Ghost‚Äôs handling is too low!
---
I was hoping that the fix would be a combination of both the original perk and the rework. IE. you can proc release the wolves by holding R for 5 seconds but ONLY after getting a kill. To me this sounded like a way to fix it but it might be op :shrug:
---
Ayy the Regime is great tho
---
Yeah, but theres better
---
Scavenger perks do not affect the wall brick
---
The second wall tho

*To qualify for the ‚ÄúPrismatic Inferno‚Äù emblem, players must have finished a Crucible match between 10 AM PST December 8 and 10 AM PST December 12 2017.*

Lol
---
Alright bro, I'm boutta head out
---
More Hz only truly helps if your computer can actually get your fps that high.  Refreshing the screen more often than the video card can draw does nothing for the image quality .  The same is true of fps that is higher than the Hz of your monitor, the extra frames are dropped.   144hz monitors let you use more of the frames your gpu renders.  I doubt you can see any benefit from more Hz beyond that.
---
Last night I had a great match in IB, was nailing headshots across equinox left and right, ended with a 12.0 rating. Next game, joined a match in progress and proceeded to get super chain-killed for the next few minutes. That match I had a 0.41 kda.
---
Who wouldnt
---
Bungie's taking it beyond small sparrows
---
3rd step is the tedios one, the melee and super are ez but the grenades are over the top
---
Yeah, the quest was brutal, but definitely worth it.
---
you‚Äôre among friends here. it‚Äôs a safe space for us all ha
---
It doesn't give more rewards so you want to reset
---
Not everybody has insurmountable skill and time to get those perks so they may not be noobs, but people grinding as quick as they can before work and/or life.
---
I have hardly seen it myself.  No one really wants to throw away their humanity (jojo!) in crucible rn
---
yea im still stuck on 3rd step on about 70% after about 30 games since grenades are so shit
---
Feel free to keep it max, but if you want to get Redrix then you gotta reset 5 times in one season
