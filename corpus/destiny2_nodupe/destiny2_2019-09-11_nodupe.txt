doesnt the selfie emote give you a selfie perspective?
---
Aye what‚Äôs the song you were listening to?

I like this because it is The Office and Destiny. Haha!
---
Bruh.

5 years.  5. Years.

I'm 2038, now the waiting game! Thanks again for letting me know about the bonus!

Still waiting on mine üò©

Lmao as another aussie who has never played D1 I can confirm that is what I thought of.

Uh I mean if your a selfish little bitch, then yea hunters have the best ability but if u actually want to be a team player then nah bruh, gotta give it to the warlocks

Just as some (hopefully) helpful advice. When you are making the comparison images you are squashing them meaning that the resolution is therefore being split. So you don't actually get a really good comparison, especially when the footage isn't taken from similar environments. When making graphical comparisons you should aim to compare areas and pictures of similar subjects if you are unable to get the expect same subject. For instance a high foliage area should be compared to an equally as high foliage area, rather than lets say a building otherwise the comparison can feel a little hard to make and doesn't give off the same effect.
---
But honestly, a really good attempt at a comparison and I am happy to see you are excited for Shadowkeep and the 4k experience you are expecting. Thank you for a great video to watch.
---
Dread it, run from it, destiny always arrives.
---
Wow that's boring af
---
GOAALLLLLLLL
---
Completely agree
---
That's boring af
---
shit video
---
Those are not her Fireteam. Just random guardians as we see in the trailers.
---
thanks man, definately needs a little more tuning and finding better areas or "exact same" areas to compare really well. also havnt figured out a way to get an actual side by side comparison without cutting the X pole by 50% lol if you know of a way to keep 100% of the screen space and still have something side by side i will use it

Just thinking about D1 thorn makes me want to throw a controller.

Doesn't tethering two people help get multi kills.
---
Shax is my best girl
---
Not easy to do always and I feel like when I try for multikills I never get them lol
---
i'll be giving you guys another 5x5 years. dont quit quit on us :D
---
Yeah
---
I mean, Shaxx is literally his own tier, so I felt it wasn't necessary to mention.
---
Oh yeah yeah
---
That went from 100 to 0 real fast
---
Yes
---
What is this atrosity oh my god whats next a matador 64 day
---
If we would rank it shax is God tier together whit the speaker
---
go to google.com type in ‚Äúwhere is Xur‚Äù go where they say, and see. Discovery is part of Destiny and I would hate to take that from you...
---
I believe you need to play three games in order to get the bonus.
---
Thank you and another quick question is Warmind any good?
---
Already did heh
---
You can always visit Xur if you have no DLCs, but you cannot visit him now as he has gone into hiding until Friday where he will make his return.
---
I mean to find them I know how to get them
---
Did it count both?
---
I am not completely sure on this but I believe so. Would be up to you if you want to wait the week or maybe get it earlier by playing another match or 2.
---
Five years ago...god dam
---
Oh ok thanks what does he sell I've heard he only sells exotics
---
Bro, Ima keep it real witchu chief, Speaker is C tier at best.
---
I did it I got my girlfriend to fabled technically by next week üëç
---
Dude, I thought I was alone with this.  So glad to see other people that feel that way.  Dinklebot was the best.  I love Nolan, but there's no comparison.  I miss Dinklage.
---
He does only sell exotics. He has a selection of 1 armour piece per class, a weapon and a fated engram which gives you an exotic which you don't own yet!
---
Well if had been Elias Toufexis I would be replaying any mode that had Ghost talking over and over and wouldn't get any other part of the game done !
---
Nice if I have no DLC does he sell DLC items?
---
[removed]
---
Indeed he does. He has a fixed inventory for everyone so we all get to see the exact same things he is selling. I believe you will not be able to use the exotics which are DLC but I could be completely mistaken.
---
Either... tusken raiders.. or minions....
---
Meh, it‚Äôs a small dlc. The larger ones like forsaken and shadowkeep are better.
---
Well, he did died so I think you have a point here
---
I've got classes everyday except Saturday and Sunday but I get a lot of homework
---
F
---
I posted this during the stream, link me to the repost
---
I do the smae thing just with my warlock
---
i want that sparrow so badly. i‚Äôm so mad they did best of y1 engrams instead of a seasonal bright engram.
---
Try using the selfie emote in the corrupted strike before you get teleported back from beating the boss...let's just say its interesting.
---
Yessssss
---
Try using the play of the game with proximity granades, really easy to hit. Just wait for a good opportunity while you grind for fabled
---
I laughed way too hard at this.
---
Eh
---
I see the wire
---
U
---
Infusing
---
Where can I do this if you don't mind me asking?
---
If you don't own Forsaken, there's no way to spend it faster than you make it. 
---
If you do own Forsaken, you will meet an NPC who sells stuff for glimmer very early on in the Forsaken campaign. This is the primary way people use up glimmer they don't need.
---
I haven‚Äôt played destiny in about 7 months bc I got annoyed with it but...
---
Something about this made me really miss it and now I‚Äôm halfway through its download
---
You can aim each set of blades.
---
No.....give her her blindfold back....I dont like that.....*nooooo*
---
If you are new, you should not worry about infusion since it costs various other currencies you will have a hard time gathering until at least completing the vanilla campaign. 
---
You go to the details page of an item and you will see a row of squares underneath the information about that item on the left side of the screen. One of them is called infusion. Infusion means sacrificing a higher power level item to transfer its exact power level to a lower item.
---
Please tell me PS4 and that you need people??
---
I am dying for new guardians to run with. Names Lucienus.
---
Leader of True Hellfire (HELL) clan. Hit me up!
---
Inspect a weapon then go to the square with a fancy yellow symbol on it
---
At the bottom of the picture says microsoft credit
---
space magic
---
For shadowkeep, 1 purchase for all platforms. For forsaken, 1 Purhase PER platform. This is if you want cross save.
---
You'll have to purchase everything again for the new platform you want to play on.
---
Game licenses don't transfer.
---
You don‚Äôt lose anything, they are connected. You can play on pc than go play on Xbox 5 seconds  later and you pick up where you left off.
---
FYI, you're replying to yourself.
---
I did the same, having a lot of fun. Also want to get familiar w controls so I can enjoy shadowkeep.
---
Been going for my reckoner title earlier today and had 3 hunters chase me with Truths while trying to drain motes then proceeded to get emoted on after they missed several rockets and finally hit one not a pleasant experience
---
ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
This is power of Requiem
---
Thank god it will be school holidays
---
Took a vacation day for shadowkeep! Gonna grind as much as I can
---
I would‚Äôve taken two just in case there‚Äôs issues.
---
Yea
---
same here
---
HIVE! BRING A SWORD.
---
That's the entire point of worm God caress
---
Risk runner or thunder lord versus taken for the Cain lightning is awesome because it kills the duplicates!
---
It‚Äôs an RNG drop from tier 2 blind well by the sounds of it, and I would need someone‚Äôs help to farm it because I only have like 240 Baryon bough and 35 dark fragments because most people at this point are tier 3 or bust. But I will try, both methods, I just know doing the 6 ascendant challenge time trials is a way to get it for sure with no luck involved
---
MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA
---
NO THEY FIXED IT
---
It‚Äôs just my friends and clan making me feel worse than I already felt for failing them, and like I said I‚Äôm a very emotionally dramatic person. 
---
But it would have been one of the last things we would need to do before shadowkeep, and we would have been able to take a break since we only want 1 whole seal. But now we still have 0 seals so we don‚Äôt have the validation of the purple name/numbers as a subtext. 
---
I personally don‚Äôt care much about that part, I was just trying to help and got the butt-end of the stick for it.
---
Technically Eris is completely blind even with the acolyte's eyes the bones that she wishes upon gave her the ability to "to know where to go" so that she could escape after losing her light.
---
Wait till shadowkeep 
---
It‚Äôs all changing
---
Oh alright
---
What about poor hunters tho, and i‚Äôm pretty sure you can‚Äôt keep throwing grenades like you consistently throw punches i might be wrong idk
---
Head - enhanced hc targeting.
---
Arms - enhanced hc loader.
---
Chest - enhanced unflinching hc.
---
Legs - enhanced hc dex.
---
These are the perks you are looking for.
---
It comes on reverly dawn, great hunt, opulant, SOTP and CoS armor.
---
Do u mean exotics?
---
Thx
---
Hunters have that long range arc one hit kill melee. That upper cut one.
---
And too be fair, I main a Titan, and I've never been able to do what that guy did in the video. And to be honest the biggest reason he was able to do it was because he caught them so fat apart from each other. Too many people in one area and he would have been dead.
---
After all this time, the biggest shock to me is that Eris was a Hunter, not a Warlock. 
---
This is beautiful, btw.
---
I mean don‚Äôt you have to recharge the ability? Idk i never played as titan but everytime i run into the i get OHK.
---
Hi,
---
Sorry, I will have to lock and remove this post as it violates Rule 12 (direct video/image capture only).

r/gamephysics for some extra karma
---
That moment when sims has a better story than destiny
---
Beautiful!
---
What the fuck is that HANS GET THE CABAL FLAMETHROWER
---
Really good art tho
---
Why is it annoying im a titan main and the bubble negates the stomp effect and.blinds enemies on the bridge i just dont place it smack dab in the middle tho
---
I didn't set it too that nor can I fix it
---
In my opinion hunters are hard to master my first character was hunter and i was playing crucible it was hard then i chnged to warlock because of pve lunafaction and well and i was playin crucible as warlock too and it was a lot easier my friend who is playing titan and he has recluse and i dont iwas trying to get it for like 2 months and he got it last week i am still 1000 points but when we played crucible 1 vs 1 on hunters i destroyed him conclusions ?
---
Not drifter.  Go to northern Nessus the floating barge and talk to that guy.
---
stop reposting this ffs
---
You'll get used to it
---
not really, looks like he used it as a meme format
---
it's probably my most recent outrageous fortune. dropped with hard launch, spike grenades, field prep and rampage.
---
thanks but i want to have the moments of triumph title.
---
as someone who rarely got to see their father because he was so busy with work 24/7 this really warms my heart and puts a HUGE smile on my face.
---
will do thanks
---
Thank you didn‚Äôt know the character exactly lol
---
10 12 peepoThink (kappa)
---
What weapons do you enjoy using?
---
NMS is so good these days. If they could combine the ship mechanics and exploration with the combat and gameplay and lore of Destiny... I‚Äôd never log off
---
The bubble is way smaller then the circle and paired with saint 14 there is no reason to leave the bubble, i treat it like my summer home in the reckoning
---
Hey lol yeah I remember that one
---
More handcannons, for one haha
---
Better get used to the bubble for shadowkeep tho
---
What about it needs to be buffed?
---
Take power ammo, look for action on the minimap and start spamming the trigger
---
Bold claim. I mean, who could have ever expected a side arm to be meta. Its gonna take a few weeks for the meta to settle after shadow keep launches
---
Definitely not hard but really easy for the stars to misalign and wipes to happen. 
---
Lots of communication needs to happen so it can feel way more hectic than it needs to be. However the mechanics do a very good job of building and applying what was learned from previous encounters. 
---
Best I can say is see if you can find a good explainer, don't be afraid to ask questions. And maybe watch a few tutorials beforehand.
---
She literally has the eyes of a Hive acolyte. 3 of them. Glowing bright green. And they ooze black goo. 
---
Sexy.
---
yes
---
Needs more Lonesome
---
Thanks for the suggestions guys! I will finish forsaken and then definitely look to check out leviathan! And some of the heroics and other stuff. Definitely just looking for some fun. I‚Äôll probably only end up playing a couple evenings a week and some on the weekend.
---
Yes it's better, but is it rally barricade? Signs point to no.
---
Yes. I do wish you good luck on it and hope you have a wonderful time. The raid is simple enough that you should be fine on understanding the mechanics
---
Is that Luna's Howl? 
---
(Sorry, it's been awhile since I've played. Readjusting to game)
---
After a series of gnawing hunger and doomsday
---
I got 1 Fourth Time the Charm, Multi Killclip Spare Rations
---
Idk whether I should cry or anything
---
CHARLESSSS FUCKING DANCEEEE
---
I think it's not forgotten, the step up from Luna's howl
---
Wouldn't you kinda have to be good at PvP to have that? I'm currently grinding for Luna's Howl and it is pretty rough for a scrub like me
---
Probs implying they paid for it or got hard carried. TBH the gun's mostly useless if you can't hit shots anyways since it relies on headshots to proc the perk. I'd probs do blast/lord of wolves with a hammerhead as the "fun police" titan
---
Every year 1 item has the exact same perks every time it drops.
---
Lately I've been using Chaperone with Sanguine Alchemy and it's DISGUTING. You know exactly when enemy titan's head gonna come from behind the corned and POOF. It's gone, reduced to atoms. My k/d improved significantly after I started using this...or it could be just that it stopped me from rushing in like an idiot...
---
If you use destiny item manager it shows your resets in the progression section
---
All good. I kept getting stuck at 1200, and was average. Plus I didnt have much time to play comp so it was a real help
---
Are you gonna post it on something like thingiverse?
---
Is that on the app?
---
Oh I would have thought it is a double extruder with how this turned out. Did you just print each part separate?
---
I ran comp last night for the first time since 2018ish and man, was it refreshing compared to QP. I‚Äôve been seeing a lot of players comment about how QP is where all the people like this are and comp is like it‚Äôs supposed to be played, and I can‚Äôt help but agree based on my experience last night.
---
It looks awesome. 
---
But I remember the barrel being a bit longer than that, right?
---
Idk... I got domed by that thing more than actually holding it in these pleb hands
---
If someone damages you it puts a mark on them (so you get X ray vision), you do extra damage to them (so you win every duel), and you get an over shield if you kill them.
---
Crusible/valor/right back at it.

I Came Out to Drown Sims in the Pool and I'm Honestly Feeling So Attacked Right Now
---
Yes, I can send you the file if you‚Äôd like?
---
If I remember correctly, it's just the playlist or nightfall. Selecting your strike won't work. 
---
It would help if you have a clan at level 5 and ask your mates to run them with you for a bit.
---
My printer is tiny, it could never print the size of parts you have, plus I don‚Äôt have the colors. Thank you tho!
---
They still got to hit you with it. Yes, these weapons are statistically better, than most other weapons, but player skill also comes into the play. If they miss one shot with the handcannon and you hit everything, you win. It all comes to who has better shot. (excluding shottie and heavy of course, that's nasty)
---
The reason I don‚Äôt play PVP,  annoying try-hards
---
I painted it, and you could use something to cut them into smaller peices for your printer
---
I have max light on all three characters it‚Äôs really not that bad
---
Believe it has something to do with it being 9/11 today so if you're not american it's probably not relevant to you
---
Oh gotcha. I think I‚Äôm still fine though. Let me know if you ever make something else!
---
And I STILL missed all those shots lmao. I'm glad you had a good time!
---
New Age Black Armory!
---
Oooofffff
---
Reminds me of the One Eyed Bandits in Borderlands 2
---
I‚Äôm thinking about doing thorn or hawkmoon next
---
Someone please explain how they say their P‚Äôs without their lips touching?
---
Any suggestions?
---
That sounds cool
---
im mildly upset steam has "about 2 weeks" for the countdown
---
Pretty much I would say stick to sidearms and hand cannons, printing large models is really hard
---
Thank you. I do have clan mates to help out. Is there any data on how much higher the drop rate is with mates and does it increase if it's 3 of us rather than 2?
---
I love sniping in Destiny, and it hurts my soul when people complain about them. High aim assist means jack-diddly if you can‚Äôt hit the shot, It‚Äôs better to hit the body than not hit the shot at all (my friend complains so often that I body him despite I typically quickscope him, so off I wouldn‚Äôt always hit the head), and don‚Äôt forget HaRdScOpInG.
---
gonna be nice getting a 6 month old new game with all the day 1 patches out the way
---
I use that or my beautiful, beautiful Good Bone Structure. Slug shot ties are my jam!
---
Holy shit wtf
---
My 95+ aim assist with a targeting adjuster and enhanced targeting means I‚Äôm good at PvP! I promise guys!
---
Fairly certain that you don't have to be in the Strike playlist and can launch a specific Strike. 
---
From what I've read, Nightfall Strikes have a slightly higher chance to drop Catalysts. Also, running with a clan member if you have the bonus (Rank 5 IIRC) will improve your chances.
---
That‚Äôs true, I would like to print a helmet in the future, possibly OEM
---
I don't think someone will explain this is 2 month old post
---
Gearbox have me worried about Homeworld 3. They're funding it so I'm hoping they don't swing that funding money around to pressure the devs to exclusive launch it
---
I want the next marvel movie to be about taking down bottom tree strikers
---
I have one with range masterwork and opening shot that I haven't used yet. I just might though
---
I just gotta say spare rations I didn‚Äôt mind until using it and it feels super crutchy man. The damn thing aims for you.
---
Honestly at close range Jotunn does. Beyond that it‚Äôs far and forget.
---
She was only given the eyes, nothing else. No worm or other stuff hive have
---
Oh yeah sure, OEM is definitely not OP. /s. You have big streamers and youtubers say how broken or OP it is like Jez or Cammy. OEM puts other exotics to shame. Literally compare OEM to Foetracer. Also your second paragraph is kinda psychotic.
---
Besides, bot tree arc titan is more effective at pub stomping than anything else. I barely see them in comp at 3k+ glory
---
This is awesome
---
Charlemagne on Discord has Service Revolver as a Top 10 kinetic. Trust as a Top 10 energy. Seems to me like plenty of people use them.
---
No Austringer. No Spare Rations. No Ace. Haven't seen a Go Figure ages (not in the Top 10 either). And again, Luna's and NF share all of the precision frame attributes that make precision frames "so good." Low recoil, better in air accuracy, etc.
---
You shut your mouth it takes mad skill to hook a jotunn shot around a corner and OHK someone.
---
No kidding. I normally run into top tree sentinels or exploding hammers.
---
I play Titan and use Antaeus wards, Chaperone, Luna/recluse/drang, and edge transit. Do I also get put in with scrubs?
---
Because those weapons are *extremely* bad in comparison to The other primaries.  Their range and ttk aren't competitive with their opposing weapons.  Sidearms are significantly worse than hand cannons in both range and ttk.  Auto rifles aren't competitive against pulses in range or hand cannons in ttk.  Scout rifles aren't competitive against pulses in ttk.  There is no niche case either, because pulses reach out as far as scouts, hand cannons reach out as far as auto rifles, sidearms don't swap fast enough to be effective... None of them have something the others don't have.  So there's just no good reason to put yourself at a disadvantage if you're a competitive person, which you probably are if you're playing PvP at this point.
---
What are some good new ones? I have played in months until recently.
---
I like the Emperors Decree shotgun with swashbuckler and feeding frenzy. Any roll on a shotgun can work but if you wanna probably push for swaahbuckler/rampage/1-2 punch rolls if you want something to just thrash high health targets.  Try and get a reload MW  on it. 
---
Baroque Drang is negligible unless you really like Sturm.
---
 People blow loads over Beloved (sniper) for pvp with snapshot/ moving target. 
---
The Calus mini tool is pretty good if you can get feeding frenzy/moving target/ killclip/ multikillclip. 
---
If you plan on doing heroic, and want the sword, always look for Surrounded on a sword. High defense/efficiency is good if you're good with blocking. 
---
Im not very knowledgeable about fusion rifles, but the ones ive had good luck with rampage and something like quickdraw or backup plan. Charge time masterwork  always. 
---
Austringer handcannon always benefits from outlaw/rampage.  But ive also seen eye ofnthe storm and subsistence be highly regarded. 
---
I mostly only play pve so i cant vouch for a lotnof pvp stuff.
---
100%. 
---
OEM is still everywhere to be seen, ofc. But what can I, a Dragon's Shadow say?
---
You are going to hate it even more when it goes back to 3v3. Because then you will see all 3 Titans using a loadout just like this.
---
Is this Netflix adaptation ??? Why is she black
---
It certainly doesn‚Äôt hurt to have, especially since it doesn‚Äôt rely on direct hits, and has more burst damage potential than swarm. Also the quest just got super easy so it‚Äôs definitely a smart pickup
---
I don't nessisarily agree, i think since destiny 2 started with nolan instead of having to have him redo dialog where the tone was already set they were able to tweak the dialog to the tone he delivered.  if you watch side by side dialog comparisons on youtube you can here that for the same dialog Nolans way of saying it feels like its squeezing enthusiam or humor out of the dialog where as in latter dialog in later dlcs and into 2 the 'jest' in the dialog is ever-present to the point when there is a serious moment it doesnt feel serious because everything that comes out of the ghosts mouth by that point seems like a joke and your used to the tone.  if dinkleage had continued i dont think they would have written the ghost to be so poppy and energetic in movement and in dialog.  heck look at cutscenes with the ghost in it, it's "body language" is completely different from early destiny 1 to destiny 2, early on he feels more robotic his movements more intentional and 'close to the chest'  where as in d2 he bobs around like a dang fairy.

I‚Äôm a warlock so I must be disadvantaged, look at this sub par ophidian aspect with hand cannon loader, retold tale? At least I‚Äôm not running mindbenders ambition. No dawnblade isn‚Äôt that op and neither is ace
---
Yeah it used to be a lot better.  It's still okay in PvP but it's trash in PvE which was the whole reason I wanted it in the first place lul.
---
2 taps were rare but 180 3 taps were crispy af.
---
HELL yeah, thanks dude! I appreciate it!
---
Well it wasn't easy to get the NF sooo... Im going to use it. I like to always mix up my class set ups because i like all the combos but i also like to pubstomp here and there .
---
So im going to use what i have to do it.
---
yea. but thats the thing. in hindsight that could make sense, since we now know there's some kind of difference.
---
On the other hand though, we've spoken to Sagira, she's all lively. We've got lore books of ghosts doing stuff and having interesting quirks to their personality (Pulled Pork scanning every single damn thing for instance). So Ghosts totally don't need to be monotone dinklebots
---
Shadowkeep is seriously gonna screw my academics and personal life üòÇ.
---
Yeah really, bottom tree titan is best for shitting on casuals in QP.  The much lower average skill combined with more players to feed on lets you just run laps wiping teams.  Less people to feed on and generally better players in comp makes it not a great super.
---
Yea I just didn‚Äôt really have supplies and it‚Äôs my first project

I'm like that but I'm a hunter with Ace of spades,hammerhead ,trust/ikelos SG/ikelos HC  and possibly the Chaperone if I'm good with it
---
They were never intended to compete against shotguns, they were primaries in year one when shotguns were heavy weapons.  They were more intended to compete with SMGs, but SMGs are also way better.
---
Prestige leviathan
---
thanks i love this
---
Glad that I could brighten up your day
---
I got mine from the chest after castellum on prestige, same as how I got my Acrius catalyst. As far as I know any chest / encounter on Prestige has a chance to drop. Won‚Äôt get it in Spire or Eater though.
---
What armor is on your arms?
---
Lore?
---
SMGs are also a close range weapon.  Shotgun, sidearms, and SMGs are close-range weapons.  Also, if you didn't notice we're not in Year 1.
---
How are you improving if you don‚Äôt challenge yourself?
---
Strong hold exotic
---
and then they tea bag you
---
I'd be the guy in the Tower grousing about New Monarchy.
---
How much do you think tho?
---
Copy
---
Cayde 6 is an entirely different story and I largely tend to agree with you, I think the entire vanguard got played to hard to their underlying personality frankly, Zavala is unbearably bloody and indecisive and Ikora is so full of doubt it's crippling to her appearance of strength.  I do think the ghost portrayal in forsaken was definitely better and I think it was due to these kinds of community criticisms thankfully.  moving forward to shadowkeep I'm curious to see the tone our ghost will reflect, I'm worried keyly about ghosts attitude to fighting our old enemies again, im hoping it's going to be appreciating the gravity of the situation instead of being the peppy parent at a kids baseball game with an insufferable 'yeah you can do this we did it before, we're so great woo!'

By the time you switch the capture circle will  be at least more than 50%

Maybe try starting smaller. Get on a LFG fireteam and play a strike with a mic on. Tell them you're not much of a talker but you'll be listening. Open the chest and call that success for the day; then the next time try two strikes or one PvP match, then a NF or a couple PvPs. Ease into it, in other words.
---
As others say you can probably find a raid team that's OK with you not talking much and some raids require less than others, but if you can't communicate even when needed it will make it harder for everyone to be successful. Definitely doable, but if you want to get the most out of the experience I'd recommend challenging yourself. I bet you'll be surprised what you can do.
---
Ooohhhh, crap. Sorry new to Reddit thought it was ok, apologies.
---
Ah, didn't pay attention to the right hand. Thanks!
---
The Leviathan Raid can drop the Skyburner's Oath Catalyst from any encounter including the first-looted run of the Castellum.
---
In addition to this the Prestige Leviathan Raid can drop both the Skyburner's Oath Catalyst\* and exclusively the Legend of Acrius Catalyst under the same circumstances. 
---
\*This is providing you haven't dont Normal Leviathan that week on that character as Prestige encapsulates its own loot + Normal Leviathan loot.
---
Yeah it did but how fast healing rifts and well regen removes any need for an overshield
---
And trust. I prefer my roll to luna's tbf.
---
I'm expecting to hear some type of "we've done this before, I know we'll get through" in a grim sort of tone, but I know I probably won't just because I'm on PC which means the game ignores my D1 play time
---
Last time I played, couple weeks ago, I saw one recluse and the rest were DRB, Luna, and NF.
---
Exotics from forges drop when you are doing a power frame. Regardless of which one. 
---
Also it will drop at bergusia but Jotunn will also be a chance there.
---
What shader is that?? I‚Äôm tying to make my titan look like Iron Man tbh üòÇ
---
You can get it from any powerful frame at the gofannon forge. It doesn‚Äôt have to be the hand cannon though.
---
I did notice, I'm pointing out that they were designed for a year 1 crucible experience without shotguns everywhere.  And sure, with enough backpedaling, you can even use a scout rifle to kill a bad shotgun ape before he finally gets in range but that doesn't make the weapon a good shotgun alternative.  I'd rather use a hand cannon or an SMG long before I'd consider a sidearm.  They're better choices for the situation, as well as being better choices for significantly more situations.  I prefer my close range weapon to do more than just hit shotgun apes while I backpedal.
---
It's a decent "put on and forget it's there" exotic but as a titan main myself, there are much better exotics that can actually allow you to make better plays, such as Antaeus Wards, Doomfangs, Heart of Inmost Light, Armamentarium, or Peregrine Greaves.
---
I'm not saying that it's not good, because it's good, but it's really not the amazing, ability improving exotic that complainers are trying to make it out to be. The overshield only procs if you're able to be away from damage for long enough for it to fully recharge and the damage bonus given doesn't lower the TTK of most top tier weapons. So at most you're getting a minor bonus to the range that you can kill someone.
---
Ahhhh alright cool thanks my dude üëçüèº
---
saving this because I've been trying to get both as well
---
Sounds good. I‚Äôll probably go for Jotunn now to add to the collection üëåüèº
---
No, it's to let other crayon-eaters they're not alone! 
---
Sincerely, 
---
A Hunter
---
I believe it's any frame that can be forged in gofannon but you are right as far as the hand cannon being a gofannon frame. It is still a numbers game though, like tell him this is how to get it but don't worry if it doesn't happen the first time
---
Unfortunatly, It's phsyically impossible for D2 to keep growing, especially at the rate it has been.
---
Same
---
I like using burst pistols and scouts
---
It‚Äôs too bad you didn‚Äôt actually read the leaked document. Everyone copies everybody else. This isn‚Äôt some kind of revelation.
---
Thos community is the biggest fucking crybaby ever when you mention OEM.
---
Warlocks and hunters mains: "we are elite and better then everyone"
---
OEM titan exists*
---
Warlock/hunter mains: "nevermind, titans kick our ass evertime"
---
I feel you. I just finished the grind for Redrix's Broadsword yesterday. I plan on staying out of the crucible for a little bit.
---
The point is you'll know wether they're gonna peek or run away and f you're hardscoping, and if you see them run away and your playing with friends you can call it out
---
I can tell a hunter main made this.
---
I did this yesterday and didn't use a rally flag :)
---
what's the hate about dredgen?
---
I wheezed.
---
don‚Äôt feel bad about loadouts, live in the sludge
---
Quit defending One Eyed Mask just because you can't play without it.
---
True and much of the time you dont even need a snipe if you're not close to some one jumping they are a real easy target
---
When your Unbroken friend invites you to play comp
---
How do you mean?  Like size limitations on consoles and such?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Cause I've played MMO's, they most certainly can continue to expand and expand with nearly no end in sight.
---
Id say yeah the game is still casual friendly but ita not as super pee wee easy mode as it was in YR1 (its still relatively easy, compared to other MMOs). Power creep is a hyge issue atm but its going to be greatly diminished with Shadowkeep. 
---
Id say if you own it already go ahead and dive in.
---
I still gotta disrespect the Erentil users.

Eh hunters are more cancerous than OEM titans IMO
---
Size limitations, balancing, making sure back end stuff works. They've already discussed how it's not feessble to keep D2 growing forever in the Directors cut
---
At least you can literally just jump over Jotunn shots lol
---
Technically it is on [Battle.net](https://Battle.net), for a few months now, and with roughly the same content as New Light.
---
To be fair. The ppl that earn NF sure as hell deserve to use it but ik I lot of ppl pay sadly
---
Well said
---
thats exactly me right down to the T!!!! except i swap out truth with warcliff sometimes #goat
---
i dont think they did it to anyone yet, but i heard it's  in the rules
---
Hunters are hard to please when they‚Äôre not dominating the game
---
Push to talk is your friend, use it!
---
Striker broken throughout the entirety of D2? That bottom tree totally sucked ass until they buffed it 5/6 months ago. You are talking out of your butthole, sir. Hammers in D1 were OP, but they did get nerfed. Are we playing the same game dude? Hunters have been meta for a long ass time.
---
hunters have been the worst class since bungie created short stops in their attempt to nerf bladedancer
---
It was broken in year 1, but in y2 with a shotgun meta shoulder charge is pretty bad.
---
Are you the dude in the video? I hope not
---
im playing destiny, youre probably playing tetris
---
Then get better. If you‚Äôre talking about Cammy he can use whatever he wants and perform well because he‚Äôs really damn good.  He also practices a ton and has insanely high reaction time and fantastic game sense.
---
It tracks Tier III
---
I just wish the shader system was more like warframe.
---
Pre-set locations for color already exist. Let us select those colors individually based on unlocked palettes.
---
Aside from gathering ammo and orbs, the first phase shouldn‚Äôt exist in tier 3.
---
Exactly. You can even bait a mask by calling that you‚Äôre marked. They may know your position but they don‚Äôt know your teammates. They can peak that lane or push a different direction and clean up a titan who gets tunnel vision.
---
You aren't missing anything. Just bad rng. Keep it up and you'll get it eventually
---
I agree. Unless you‚Äôre seriously worth your salt you shouldn‚Äôt  really go for 15
---
Ahhh and I'm over here banging my head into a wall after playing comp about 14 hour for 6 days straight and not getting Fabled got Revoker and on the fateful day that I hit Fabled I'll get the Recluse and Luna's Howl and at this rate Mountaintop too if I ever hit Fabled anyway
---
That indeed is a Hunters knife
---
Nice! What's the song? Is it a remix from RoI?
---
It‚Äôs so true
---
What when and for how long
---
"Guardians never die. but we don't forget the ones that do."
---
Quick play does not have sbmm, it used to, but it was removed several months ago. The dev blog is discussing adding it back.
---
I was going off online information, whish states 0.25 for visual and 0.17 for audio.
---
You're also pitting a top tier player against a top tier player where both know how to move and dodge shots. A top tier player vs a standstill player like I'm assuming you are doing, they will easily hit their ttk.
---
These memes are getting really fucking old.
---
Don‚Äôt forget the damage buff as well, goofy!
---
I mean, I earned my jersey as a Collector and usually bank ~70 motes in regular Gambit and ~60 in Prime and I won‚Äôt bank 15 unless those motes are in or near my path back to the bank. I might pull 15 a little more in Prime when I have a full Collector set, but even that is me playing a little greedy. Greed usually gets punished after the first 3 minutes of a match, I find.

---
That was beautiful üò≠
---
The fact that he bagged right after he did it was even more degrading lmao ü§£üòÇü§£
---
On console it's stompees, dust rock, recluse and wardcliff.
---
And here I am feeling anxious because I haven't even started the pursuit.
---
yuuuup. I got mine and i have 75 kills with it. Theres just so many better options. If they brought it back up to 180 it would dominate.
---
RTL
---
Nice!!! Congrats!
---
Nah I got myself into that one.  Idk I‚Äôm not trying to say ‚ÄúI could go pro if only I used DRB‚Äù or anything, but I also can‚Äôt ignore how much better I do with meta weapons equipped.  At the end of the day it‚Äôs just a game and if I don‚Äôt care about winning then I shouldn‚Äôt care about losing either.  I just think people like that other dude saying ‚Äúyou‚Äôd suck with or without meta weapons,‚Äù aren‚Äôt nearly good enough themselves to be saying that.
---
I was waiting for a blade barrage
---
Not what I meant. Your Warlock using Well of Radiance should be free to use any exotic (preferably Lunafactions) as long as your hunter is using tether frequently.
---
Having the ability to track through walls is a godsend to me.  I find the way people treat cornering to be pretty predictable as it is, so having the ability to then also track them just feels dirty.
