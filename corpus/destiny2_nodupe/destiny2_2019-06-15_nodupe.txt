I'll see myself out, and I'm sorry for that shitty pun

Dodge too btw. I don‚Äôt know if it actually does but it sure feels like it
---
Hahaha that‚Äôs actually pretty funny.  Trust issues lol
---
My favorite is when they do it too early and you can just hear the brain trying to reconnect
---
I‚Äôm just trynna finish my mountaintop man
---
Nice job !
---
&gt;GLs
---
I really wish they were good enough to warrant salt
---
Good thing everyone is using snipers right now lol
---
In my post on r/destinymemes I thanked and gave credit to the original author. I didn't want to do it twice and annoy him.
---
If you haven‚Äôt run into some fuckass using Luna‚Äôs and 3 grenade launchers you‚Äôre a lucky man
---
That shit is one of the most annoying things in the game
---
&gt;Luna‚Äôs and 3 grenade launchers 
---
Man‚Äôs using four guns? God damn.
---
I‚Äôm 60% for my mountaintop double kills between now and last week bro, they are horrible.
---
R e a d
---
My brain is fried, forgive me brother
---
me too but I also like to snipe. I also only manages 25% of the double kills in the last 2 seasons so there is no way I will get it in this season anyway so I will just have slme fun
---
I always have one running and I have the buff where I get 2 runes. Right now I'm farming Hush in gambit so I get some sweet sweet blue runes for the shotgun well i am at it.
---
‚Äúhow do you think we got here?‚Äù
---
hmmmmmm
---
Boo!
---
I always 420 after I 69.
---
A personal experience maybe?
---
I‚Äôve done 60% in the last week. Around 10% a day.
---
Use whatever guns you want and a good heavy GL (I use colony, it works believe me) and just play heavy like a sweat.
---
i was thinking nut
---
Np
---
Telesto is 100% better than loaded question.
---
BUT loaded question doesn‚Äôt take up an exotic slot, and is pretty close to telesto
---
Where is this?
---
This pleases the n u t
---
I‚Äôm the same way, exotic heavies are fucking amazing, but I actually like to consistently use my exotic, which you can‚Äôt do with heavies. You used to be able to with whisper but then they nerfed it

[There are a variety of places to find people in this post and its comments.](https://old.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/bzjpkr/official_lfg_megathread_v_4/) The easiest raid in my opinion is Eater of Worlds, but Leviathan isn't so bad.

You can't buy it through battle net, but yes, it is on amazon.

It was literally just a meme lol and ive been using fighting lion with austringer all day, I just think the other 140s should feel like austringer
---
Did you watch the raid? Basically xQc forced two smaller streamers to carry him, while ignoring their explanations and the mechanics to talk to chat. He turned a &gt;90 minite raid into 3 hours with some of the best raiders in the world lmao
---
Go
---
Punch him with all of your might
---
Yeah, look online to see what's dropping this week. Each week is a different gun and then one week it can be all the guns, they drop randomly from the lvl 7 boss... It might take you 1 run or it might take you 30 runs... I do believe the more you do the better chance you have. Also, try to find and stick with a group that's farming it because once you beat level 7 you restart from level 6... Makes it much quicker to grind level 6 and 7 only vs all of them.
---
Well that's why bungie are changing up the newer weapons they release to make them feel more powerful, to close the gap so to speak.

I've mained Titan since D1. 140s will 100% get dumptrucked by Luna's, NF, Trust, or Service Revolver on console. If you're making a 140 work, then chances are you're playing potatoes. 
---
Cool assumptions though.
---
Lmao, I've been playing destiny since it released, so think what you like. However if you're just gonna be a dumbass who has nothing to say, go elsewhere.
---
I just used ace of spades, yeah it will go slower than using a void hc but i was getting twice as many kills.
---
Except horribly
---
Then you're a disgrace to titans. Lemme guess, you rock OEM?
---
I've used my age old bond for it, if i had used a hand cannon i probably would've taken thrice as long.
---
It doesn't matter, people do it anyways and nobody cares. Plus r/DestinyTheGame is both games also, but no memes

I wish burning maul looked like that in game

Agreed.

I don't get it. Why?

Is it outpacing the wendigo though?
---
I don't hate it, but I'm definitely.not very good at it. My 1.1 kd is a testament to that.
---
F
---
Yeah, for that encounter for sure, can't wait to do more testing with that launcher when IB comes back. This vid was just showing how dumb good the Wendigo was
---
Dunemarchers, preferably. Are you done trying to be edgy yet?
---
Ikelos HC is probably the best bet from experience.
---
I had 2 drop yesterday in half the time it took to get a prime
---
They don‚Äôt track well
---
The inside joke is relating to a porno.
---
Oh. Duh.
---
Okay will probs get it tonight although I‚Äôm confused on which one to get on Xbox one? Could you possible link the right one?
---
I laughed way too hard at this
---
That‚Äôs probably very true
---
The entirety of the game is on sale right now in the Xbox store for 40 bucks. Everything and the annual pass that'll get you caught up to the next expansion coming out in September.
---
Forsaken
---
Was it really forced though? It seemed like Slayer, Datto, Chevy, and the guy before Chevy were fine with doing it, and they were letting xQc and crew figure the raid out themselves with little hints when necessary
---
Also, it's not that xQc ignored what they were saying, he's just kinda braindead sometimes

Okay

I'd like to have xQc's 5 figure view count in the Destiny directory

People will see it and try the game

Bring back all D1 strike mods!

Dude!  New phone wallpaper thank you!

I don‚Äôt think so, but depending on the platform you bought it for, I‚Äôd try and cancel the preorder
---
Not a bad roll tho
---
You stole this from destiny memes that‚Äôs why he posted it here
---
*your are bum*
---
No words can explain how god damn beautiful this is. Good fucking job!!

Or the Winston that dives on it and drops his shield

Oh? You're approaching me?

And that Borealis ornament tat I never use. And a legendary ship, which is the definition of shite.
---
Destiny is the Dark Souls of fps, after all.
---
I cant beat the shit out of you without getting closer.
---
no you don‚Äôt you just need to do the raid, you just go to the location where it is on the directory and it‚Äôs next to it, i would recommend being past 700 light as it does get higher as you progress
---
Papa Shaxx is proud
---
The real questions never get answered
---
Idk then keep farming
---
How do you know it's a perm ban?
---
This is really amazing! Thank you for sharing!
---
So is 19 the highest?
---
Try using the explosion delay to your advantage. If you keep trying for direct hits then you won‚Äôt get anywhere.
---
GL meta was a mistake. Darkest Before meta was best meta.
---
Your chalice from menagerie moves from character to character, Along with the 690 armor you got.
---
Nice
---
I just did Ace of Spades in comp and went for headshots.
---
Hope we see Cayde-6 as a shadow boss. Classic I'm angry you could have saved me!
---
I love you
---
I still don't see how you could T-pose without slitting your throat. 3/10.
---
The devs are saying that this game will get a lot more RPG and MMO-like once the new expansion comes out in September, so I would check out some gameplay to see if what we have right now interests you, and if it does, buy it and get all caught up to where everyone is.
---
You're forgetting about the bloom on Handcannon's. Outbreak, or any pulse, takes no skill to use in this game. They are all just that good.
---
So how long did that bad boy take to make
---
Fucking. Dope.
---
Look up MyNameIsByf on YouTube... all your questions and more will be answered there.

Are you watching Bungie?!
---
First off, buy the other DLCs, the price got dropped for everything.
---
Thats good. I only did the lowest one lol thank you.
---
Noob Saibot? Is that you?
---
So enter the strike then just ride over to the blind well after you load into it?  That's genius!
---
r/wejumpthreetimes
---
Not bad but
---
[deleted]
---
750 currently
---
Yeah, I'd recommend taking 2 friends with you so no ransoms do the strike without you. It's really easy and can get you good rewards as well! You'll get the gun soon, good luck on the grind!
---
Ya match making really sucks. The sad truth is that you most likely will need to get lucky with good teammates since you are new to crucible. The other option is to use 3rd party sites to find a team willing to grind comp.
---
You can get treasure maps (not the same ones) from Benedict in the Annex.
---
The dreaming city map's portals are my favorite for dodging the average invader since you can chain through them in quick succession.
---
Isn‚Äôt it izinagis burden sniper rifle? I use honed edge x4 for that juicy one shot body shot
---
Do you mean drang? If you do you can only re-acquire it on the character you completed the quest for strum on.
---
Hope this helps ;)
---
Gotta help em grind.
---
Can u buy it back via your inventory tab?
---
You can get different ones from Benedict in the Annex.
---
DarkHammer: 40k Souls to Purge
---
Calus was no match for my secret "punch you until you die" fighting technique
---
That‚Äôs so so good. And hes dressed like my Titan, OEM and wing discipline. Absolutely love it.
---
So there's 3 of you and 7 of them.
---
Top storm, bottom dawnblade, sentinel with doom fangs and bottom striker are all better for PVP than any hunter super, spectral feels OP simply because it‚Äôs the best option on hunter so you‚Äôll see it more due to there being more hunters in PVP.
---
Matchmaking amirite
---
Git gud.
---
Thank you, I‚Äôm awake way too late
---
Probably a hunter main.
---
I actually like it quite a bit. For me it just feels really good and accurate. I also like that it's a kinetic sniper. As far as missing a head shot, I generally switch to a weapon with good handling to clean up. 
---
Another perk is since it's aggressive, I run a warlock, so with empowering rift you 1 shot body shot. 
---
Also really enjoy the scope. So far it's been the perfect sniper for me. Even coming from my twilight oath.
---
99% players I see in crucible are Shotgun One Eyed Titans. Literally 6 vs 5 One Eyed sweats match every time.
---
Who doesn't add bloom? Get good
---
Just gotta practice it.
---
Ok I‚Äôll grab a year one drang from my collections thanks.
---
Fuck I wish I had time and 5 friends too goof around with in raids with.
---
Where are knives is this conversation lmao
---
No problem.
---
I am a bad pvp player. 
---
So if for some reasons I am top scoring for a couple of rounds, something is either very wrong or I am just going against a bad team.
---
Thanks
---
Have done easily 540s and 360s while knifing thrall, gets you a bit dizzy sometimes.
---
YEEEEET!
---
I pulled out my ghost and I can see that it says I‚Äôm tracking it but how do I find where to go for the mission
---
Does this game have matchmaking yet ? Or the technology just not there ?
---
Might be the shortest f2p launch in history
---
i have the same fuckin problem. apparently my friends dont give a shit about lore :/ but dont worry, imma keep fillin em in :)
---
Yea it‚Äôs worth buying it but I‚Äôd buy the digital deluxe edition of Shadowkeep instead, you‚Äôll get the year 3 annual pass instead of the year 2 annual pass... but it‚Äôs still worth buying!
---
Really? Tbh you shouldn't really need to the getting to the stage they spawn if u can give the decent damage output. Hence. Not inconvenient.
---
Referred from a friend. I recommend anyone new or old to check his stuff out. Learning things I never paid an ounce of attention to.
---
Jump? Its not that hard to avoid red bar knights
---
Not trying to back up the other guy but you put ‚ÄòIzanagi‚Äôs burden‚Äô and ‚Äòget good‚Äô next to each other.
---
True but that‚Äôs really the only one of the super regen exotics that remain close to as useful as they were in the past.
---
Lord of Wolves is currently meta in PvP
---
It‚Äôs a 99.9999999999% chance he isn‚Äôt. We‚Äôre pretty sure he‚Äôs not, but we don‚Äôt have concrete evidence to prove he is. 
---
It‚Äôs just about as likely that Zavala is Yor.
---
What‚Äôs funny is that you still don‚Äôt understand, so you bring it back to the woosh guy.
---
Turns out pussyslayer42069's name is Henry. And Henry's mom needs him to take care of his laundry.
---
Remember, instead of acting toxic, and make fun of someone way under your lvl, you support him if he needs help. That's what I'm always doing.
---
very clever! I like you
---
Ah yes, a ready to harvest pineapple.
---
I really don't understand how a slower firing aggressive frame grenade launcher can out dps a full auto exotic gl with a damage after effect.
---
A lot of other spreadsheets and videos I've seen say prospector is highest, with the new wendigo coming really close with the explosive light perk.
---
**_‚ÄùTalos guide you!‚Äù_**
---
The Nine are the dark matter around the nine planets. All the living creatures acting like neurons firing on a brain made the dark matter come alive, i guess. I'm not a lore master so this is the best way i can explain it. 
---
It's pretty awesome idea though.
---
damn man didn't mean to trigger some bad memories
---
Look at CoolGuy's YT channel he has a video about the new menagerie Hand Cannon
---
100% disagree. The weapons at that point would not feel special if they were farmable. Everyone would have the gun in a week and then people don‚Äôt have a reason to do the raid. They are special right now because not everybody has them and they are hard to get.
---
I'm super inconsistent at gunplay most of the time; some days I'll be like John Wick with guns blazing, other days I try to hunter dodge away from fire and hit the wall and die anyway, so I actually try to aim for a high efficiency ratio. I might not be hitting high scores, but trying not to die is a really good way to actually help your team. If you don't die they don't score.
---
Yes, I‚Äôm looking for an smg specifically. I am considering swapping out my load out by changing my Recluse for a sniper and change my kinetic sniper for a smg.
---
The dlc is definitely worth it all the fun stuff is locked behind the dlc.
---
Pinnacles are like exotics, their quests are always available
---
Yeah, ask them to summon a Sparrow
---
I'm pretty sure it is
---
At least make him the new Speaker
---
Yeah. You can carry on :) it's tied to your account. Not your disc.
---
Lmao. People are farming kills in strikes... Really weird how you can activate the well while doing missions.
---
When you go into the chalice it prompts you to unlock the rune slot at the top of the screen, the chalice is in your persuits
---
The one I am using is called the Bronco
---
By that logic, any Guardians you do want to meet would be ‚Äújust another story NPC.‚Äù My point is that Osiris was a dude we just heard about in the side-story for literally all of Destiny 1, and then we met him.
---
Unless you mean you want them like in the open world shooting baddies with us, which I guess would be neat, but it‚Äôs just not something MMOs do. Don‚Äôt know why actually, that seems like a pretty arbitrary decision that was made a long time ago. Except for when they do fight with you and it‚Äôs just a chore of an escort mission lol. Imagine: ‚ÄúMission failed - Osiris fuckin died‚Äù
---
That's pretty bad ass

This is only a redesign i made to look nicer in discord chats
---
Been using Loaded question on and off since it dropped, it was a solid gun. Now with the buffs, it never leaves my energy slot. 1 shots most ultras and 2 shots everything stronger. Plus the added add killing from reservoir burst. Beast mode.
---
Is the boss the ghaul devotee?
---
Great thanks :) good to know.
---
I think when I first fell in love with it, it was actually *because* of it's slow draw+charge time. Before then, I'd mostly used pulse rifles because I depended on the 3rd round to be my precision hit. Basically, I wasn't great at aiming, and pulse rifles allowed me to get precision damage without precision aim. The bow forced me to slow down and take better shots.
---
And then I got used to a) explosive rounds (even body shots are usually one-hit kills on grunts), b) no reloading, c) easy to get kinetic ammo, d) long range, and e) more than anything: fully maxed out accuracy. The bow wants headshots more than I do. Despite it's draw+charge time, I even use it to take out Invaders in Gambit all the time (pvp scares the shit out of me, lol).
---
Tldr: it helped me become a better player, and now I'm addicted.
---
Wake up. We‚Äôve got a city to rebuild.
---
I'm looking to raid also, add me GT is GeneralATK2
---
Was hoping for that comment:)

It looks great. Is the armor the crucible set along with one eyed mask?

Once you get to higher levels you get legendary (purple) and exotic gear which yes is a lot more interesting. And there‚Äôs also guns from the raids that have unique perks on them. But you‚Äôre not gonna see a gun where you throw the gun when reloading and it becomes a missile like in blands
---
The fact bungie bans for this, and doesnt ban comp cheesers blows my mind.
---
Yes early stuff is just boring, once you hit about level 20 things will start to pick up
---
I see no titans in my games üíî
---
Yep, works really well with the Better Already/Recuperation perks. Now you can heal even when you‚Äôre full super
---
I've seen some people talking about this thing in PvP lately, what's going on? Is LQ the new meta because I got it and just kept using my backup plan Main Ingredient any time I wanted a legendary fusion.
---
Lucky
---
Well done dude, this is a great chart.
---
Not killing the knights is  the whole point
---
I mean it's kinda pointless to try and compare the 2. Borderlands 2 has over 17 million weapons so of course the loot will be more interesting
---
This annoys me
---
Not if I have more to say
---
Don't worry OP, just keep the faith. Warlock is for those of us in the upper echelon, a gentleman's class.
---
Technically it's when your heart isn't beating properly, it's more of a flutter than a full beat and it's super dangerous. In the game it's when you don't fulfill one of the mechanics so the boss kills you by stopping your heart, specifically in the arkborn encounter if you let the soul collector buff get to 0 secs without depositing.
---
All of my friends quit destiny a while ago. I still enjoy doing most things solo, and as for things that can‚Äôt be done solo (raid), I use the Find Fireteam option on Bungie‚Äôs website
---
Dam dude, I‚Äôve got sleeves and 350 is so expensive for just that bit. 
---

---
r/bonehurtingjuice
---
The cabal never stood a chance
---
Idk it seems in Cali they‚Äôre a lot more expensive because compared to other pieces I‚Äôve had done that‚Äôs really not bad. It did take about 3.5 hours usually that lines up.
---
Moon's haunted.
---
But I don‚Äôt get it because I can‚Äôt deposit during the boss phase...
---
I hope you take some type of vitamin D supplements because you‚Äôre clearly not getting enough sunlight.
---
Yes, but since you didn't score a kill and didn't die your average doesn't change.
---
Austringer is like a baby Midnight Coup but better, roll with outlaw + rampage + rampage spec
---
Now we can smoke these pesky spectral blades lol. No seriously LoW a bit too strong
---
That isn't a great argument. If, say, it went from 100% better to 1% better, that's still a huge nerf even if it is still better. If bungie nerfs it out of existence, people complain. If they nerf it less substantially, people complain.

I would also recommend the new drang

Gotcha. Tried racking my brain for something and this was not one that came to mind.

Its alright

Nope. Any red works

I really like it too. My roll has full auto with high impact reserves. Pretty decent
---
How was Lord Shaxx not on the top of the board?!
---
Well, that kills destiny on stadia.
---
No? Not to me either :(
---
Rheyve said this before. Idk why people think googles stadia has anything to do with pc servers. Its literally an entirely new console in and of itself.
---
Only pay to progress is if you want to pay to level a second or third character up to 20 so they can start the forsaken campaign.
---
Blueberries as far as the eye can see ruining perfectly good nearly heroic public events..

The faggots that start the encounter before people can get there are detrimental

I liked it better in D1
---
Don‚Äôt think it makes a difference tbh

The Revoker. Pinnacle crucible weapon for this season.

How‚Äôs that bow? I can‚Äôt imagine it‚Äôs too good on console, especially for what you have to go through for it.
