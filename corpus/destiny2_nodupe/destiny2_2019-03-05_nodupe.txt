why even have the gun if you don't like playing crucible....
---
---
---
Can someone check on this man? I think he had a stroke between the title and the body.
---
Is it weird that I’m the most psyched for Sentry and Collector? Health regen near the bank? 20-more blockers?!?! This is gonna be awesome!
---
From what I've seen, this is apparently a new bug happening to players at random when they play Gambit.
---

---
[This Reddit Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/axbnbs/so_gambit_is_causing_some_issues/) has your post and another's listed. I don't think this is coincidence. There are comments on that post that has reported other users losing characters, too. It's happened more to XB and PC accounts. Not many PS4 reports.
---
I have also made a [Bungie Post](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Post/251192585) as well to spread the awareness, just in case.
---
Avoid Gambit. Or play at the risk of losing your Guardian. I for one will not be setting foot into Gambit or the new Gambit content until there's some sort of statement or more information on the matter. It's just not worth the risk.
---
Thanks!
---
Agree, with Invader perk that steals Motes, I see needing a Sentry a must.  And I bet those fights would be epic too, Invader damage buff vs Sentry aoe regen, personally I am going to grind for Sentry first then Invader armor sets.
---
Right on
---
It's fun in pve. 
---
It was, not after its nerf though.
---
F
---
I did malfeasance and breakneck at the same time so grind wasn’t terrible. To top it off I didn’t head back to the drifter until I finished both so it felt good to take both at the same time.
---
Tbh I am not that excited for this content as I was for everything else. Me playing gambit prime heavily depends on the type of weapons and rolls that drop and how they fair in the crucible. Or if exotics steps require you to play. 
---
I really wished the crucible pinnacle weapon was a sniper rifle tho but I will grind for that smg. 
---
pls no I'm just doing clue 
---
I did this + Lunas this season ... And yes.  Burnt on crucible is an understatement
---
enjoy ur 10 gp split
---
Malfeasance was and never will be better than Y1 Thorn. And Besides, after its nerf it was not annoying at all, you were almost handicapping yourself by using it 
---
Nobody:
---
Destiny Players: Wow! Some destiny killer!
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Seriously this community is the worst. 
---
I already main Jotunn with 2x Special Ammo Finder and 1x Fusion Rifle Scavenger. But I can potentially swap perks and still main Jotunn with this.
---
this one time in the middle of my first and last 3-hour crucible experience I was running blink, and forced a dawnblader to waste his ENTIRE DAWNBLADE SUPER and still not hit me once. blink is so much fun
---
Ha
---
He insulted my Ghost. That's all it took for me. I don't care how spineless my Ghost is; ***no one insults my Ghost, except me.***

Ok?

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8S6hhtzF3Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8S6hhtzF3Y) it's based on a metal gear meme

Guacamole nigga penis
---
here's a tip: you can only get one of the kind of the scrapper bounty, so deleting them will cause another one to spawn eventually. leave them around so you don't get another one
---
Braetech site lists which ones your missing someone did the math if your missing one say in futurescape being out furthest away from it like the end of the generator path you have the calculated best odds of getting that one you need 
---
Well at least the hair dryer has cluster bombs....
---
Nah, I like the CoO strikes.

Those long-ass triangular hallways always turn into impromptu foot races, and I love zipping past people by WLZ/tesseract skating.

Damn, what else has this guy done with Frostmourne?
---
Oh this meme formats gonna be good
---
Close game 4hed
---
No but still he got all of almost killed because he wanted to destroy the almighty
---
That's awesome advice, ty kindly.
---
That's fresh!
---
These aren't the ones for the ace quest. Before cayde died, he sold treasure maps that would lead you to hidden stashes. OP is looking at one, which cannot be obtained anymore due to the lack of cayde.
---
You can swap perks and take another special for your kinetic slot on top of it. Keep Jotunn as your primary and use a shotgun for miniboss/hvt dps. Or grab a sniper for anti-invade. Or use Mountaintop/Milita's Birthright for shots n giggles. They all kill faster than most primary weapons.
---
Damn it, now you've gone and Fast &amp; Furious'd it.
---
It'd be nice if the prime could also include items from the activity you were doing. Eg. if your prime dropped from Gambit then your prime had a chance to drop gambit weapons/armour. 
---
bungie pls I need to gold my fighting lion/telesto/tractor/jotunn
---
In your video parameters, there is something at the bottom called "chromatic aberation"  
---
Turn it off
---
For me, it’s getting there.  The train part always annoys me and I think the strike is glitched with the elevator still.  I don’t know because I won’t do it anymore.
---
&gt;Merkury 
---
Um
---
Hunter class is the most op class in the game worth the grind and I’m a lvl 650 warlock. Warlock class is fun to use but, there’s nothing worse than getting melted by a hunters blade barrage even a warlock teleport w nova class it’ll still catch ya. When as a hunter they’ve got the dodge which also reloads their weapons if they successfully avoid enemy’s rounds.

This is your only warning.

Okay done heres a link [https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/axf3ms/riven\_pixel\_art\_credit\_to\_uze\_awesome\_hobo/](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/axf3ms/riven_pixel_art_credit_to_uze_awesome_hobo/)
---
Petra did come after he passed, but just.
---
Dang. Welp i hope you find help traveler
---
Complete forsaken base campaign. Open dreaming city.  This opens the raid and dungeon (shattered throne). Grind levels until 610+. Can start working on black armory content by talking to ada in the tower
---
How so? I've seen handcannons that outrange snipers with accuracy, fire as fast as scout rifles, and reload faster than any category. They have more exotics than any other class. They're too accurate and fire too quickly in my opinion.
---
/r/expectedthanos
---
Blade barrage is decent but it requires getting first seed of light etc and I just didn’t have enough fun to justify playing it through that far. I’ll always play my titan over anything else I just want a fun viable option to complete the other side of the allegiance quest with plus I know from raids I’ve done warlocks come in handy always 
---
Most of the D2 youtubers put out the exact same shit. But I like his because of his accent. And Aztecross because he explains stuff well. Despite his voice. 
---
There are also PC and PS4 divisions too!!
---
I agree there’s so many exotics in the category and it’s kinda annoying that shotguns or sidearms don’t get the same love, but there’s a difference between powerful and over powered, they are the most powerful of all the weapon types but they certainly have their issues 
---
Oh ok so that’s how that works. Thanks man
---
They retracted that statement 
---
I would hope so
---
They patched the cheese though?  Unless there is a new one
---
You all need to chill.
---
We all know we would rather have Lord Shaxx choke us out!!!
---
nvm.
---
Wasn't aware you could put Obsidian accelerator on whisper
---
The only reason I don’t like it REPETITIVE 
---
Its definitely not too late. If anything, you're going in at a good time. Play through the campaign, which i REALLY recommend. There's some consumable you get that'll bring you to forsaken level, but you'll miss the story and easy exotics (you get a few just playing as quest rewards). 
---
Also, when Season of the Drifter launches tomorrow, there will be bounties to get you to 640 after you complete the campaign.  If anything, you'll be coming in at a good time.
---
Yes. Still runs at 75 FPS on average, but it now routinely dips below 50 on my GTX 970 when it used to be nearly completely stutter free. Hopefully the Vega 56 I’ve got coming will solve that
---
... ravager?
---
Problem Anthem has isn't a lack of content though, like D2 had. Granted there is also a lack of content but Anthem has far greater issues in the amount of bugs and now hardware failures it's causing mostly to PS4 players. Only time will tell but Anthem is in a far more dire position already than D2 ever was. 
---
Is this some waits destiny vanguard kink I've never heard about?
---
??
---
I ended up grinding it out during crimson days, while doubles was active. personally, I'd do QuickPlay but play cautious. you don't need final blows, only defeats.
---
QB is getting nerfed with update, Hammerhead will probably be new meta.
---
Very well done indeed.  
---
One day Lord of Wolves and Cerberus +1 will be mine (among 20 others) and then I will know your power.  
---
GG man
---
Who else remembers the 2-tap and walk away in year one of D1?
---
Check their twab
---
Prepare for 4 giant blockers all coordinated 
---
Telesto is king when it comes to killing blockers. It can take down an ogre in about 4 shots
---
Get a 200k+ highscore once,  then do low point runs as fast as possible.  Im gonna be real man.  I spent 9 hours on farming in one day and never got it. I spent a total of 20 hours farming for it before i actually got it.  If you keep running it the exclusive nf drop rate will increase every time you beat it. 
---

Funny enough I won a  against a 4 stack today
---
The Riskrunner + effects turn this from a normal shitpost into a *quality* shitpost. Well done OP.
---
Petition to let me shoot him, removing his dumb ass from the game. 
---
More time to go to orbit.
---
Is it still possible to complete the quest after the next season 
---
Actually sounds kinda cool
---
you get your bullet back with 6shooter at least lmao
---
Smart man taking advantage of that no death penalty 
---
Yes there is a post on this sub with higher quality screenshots
---
Also a dredgen, Phalanx is definitely the best sell. Spam the enemy team with a ton of those and they'll never get anywhere.
---
oh thank god you specified. Haha
---
Thank you, sorry for the inconvenience.
---
&gt;Im a dredgen
---
Me too, and the fact that you just said that like it has all the clout in the world attached to it is extremely lame. Real dredgens (I'm cringing myself out now) have gameplans for when they're the target. 
---
Most effective blocker is the biggest one you can send. You've been dredgen less than a week, I got that title months ago.
---
This is what we all do the day before new content drops
---
Guess your feelings were hurt huh?
---
I'm getting both sides of the story, but I'm more interested in Drifter's side as my favorite aspect of the lore is the Dredgen Yor mystery and the past of the Drifter. Love me some good dudes turned bad, always intrigues me
---
Can I just say how much I love the little bags/pouches on the new armor sets? Amazing work Bungie!
---
Sorry to asl, but what is a Well of Light? Do they mean Well of Radiance?
---
Hey dude. We both obviously said some stupid and hurtful shit. I'm sorry for what I said and I hope you have a good evening, no bullshit. There is no reason for me to be talking to someone like that. We both just want to game and have fun.
---
Why is this a question?
---
I havent played D2 since Apex came out so you just made yourself sound super ignorant. Nice. Also the ogre takes a shotty clip to kill. So about 2 seconds. Phalanx wonky physics can send you across the map. Drop 4 phalanx at a time they’ll kill atleast one enemy. Judging from your comment history... you’re about 15 and think you know everything. Just admit you’re wrong lmao
---
FINALLY someone else who uses riskrunner arc warlock
---
I keep saying it's a god send man.
---
Is it possible to avoid this rng?
---
Not at all, I’m genuinely curious as to why you posted that comment. Was it to get a reaction? Did you really think it was funny? Most people I know have a fairly decent sense of humor at the very least, and that was a profoundly unfunny joke, so I really do want a real answer.
---
Opinion
---
I have accidentally done it several times, though I can never replicate it 
---
Equip a sword and enjoy your 3rd person. Other than that I think not.
---
Oh I know.
---
It's that I keep ending up on the bad end of either bait or just bad luck in general.
---
I do play for this aggressively.  Just not getting any luck.
---
I have yet to crack 20%
---
Fi... fifty... fifty three motes.... lost?
---
Someone should make a meme where it shows it shows the drifter with the dredgen title but when shin shows up he goes into the Bush (the Simpsons bush meme/ I think that's what its called) and comes out with the drifter/wayfarer title. 
---
Yeah bungle need to remove the player count from crucible so kids who are afraid of losing can't do this.
---
it completes for me when it goes heroic
---
literally spent the last 2 months grinding for the 18 kelvins and finally picked it up on Friday. It'll roll in!
---
Question - what's a blueberry in the context of Destiny 2? I'm pretty new, so I haven't heard that term before.
---
Imo Titans have ohk to Tempt new players to not get overwhelmed by a more skilled player. By getting that cheesy ohk it makes getting juked and owned not hurt as much. The problem is that skilled players play with the Cheesy Titan bc its a easy learning curve which to me is less rewarding than mastering a hunter. If Hunters had ohk the game would be a titans nightmare and we all know Bungie loves titans.  
---
They should. They should also add a solo que.
---
Because you switched off the pfp i made for u
---
Forsaken stand alone.
---
For now, since the annual pass isn’t on sale (at least in PC)
---
You mean you can't buy it?
---
Sale price sorry ;)
---
It was on sale last week for 30% off 
---
r/memeconomy
---
I believe so... With all of the Gambit stuff happening.
---
Oh, damn... alright. The deluxe perks aren't worth it? 
---
I believe so... With all of the Gambit adjustments coming. Like
---
“Mm mm nigga, mmm mmm. Fuck that!”
---
When I was in your spot last week, it seems that it is not.  The ornaments and such are kind of blah.  I went with the Forsaken stand alone.  If the season/annual pass seems like it’s worth it tomorrow with the update I’ll grab it, but.
---
At least he’s not dead * tears up*
---
Can’t :(
---
I’ll be stroking something alright ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Better loot? Sheesh I have to look back to quite a ways since anything meaningful dropped from a public events chest. 
---
bf found it by accident and told me to check it out, never seen it before either. the targeting track thingy.
---
It's a bigger waste of time when I have to do 4 Cryos before blueberries will let me freeze the bastard so I can open the stupid forge.
---
Thanks for the info, i might have to check this out.
---
you havent? it always happens when a scannable object is nearby. and im pretty sure there is a scannable behind the drifter. but it isnt trough the door
---
I mean, technically you can.  You just choose to not be Super Pro Awesome is all...
---
Fif!!
---
nothing except the stuff from claiming the bounty
---
Dear professor 
---
Sorry I wasn’t in your class today you I was busy bagging motes
---
How i can side with Holliday for some sweet sexy flights in the dark space.
---
Same. It's my personal theory that the matchmaking has some sort of skill compensation with stacks. 
---
It's just anecdotal evidence but when I have a stack on my team they are always at the bottom of the scoreboard 
---
After 20-something under 10-minute Garden Worlds later, still no ship :(
---
Lucky, I haven’t seen a single exotic drop in weeks.  
---
This, especialy weekly bounty, and with triple infamy, you can skip the last part!
---
can we take a moment to appreciate that whoever is designing d2 armor finally got their head out of their ass and created some dope armor
---
Fuck this game 
---
Well, I spend all of mine for mod components so
---
But he thought he could control it?
---
That’s all good and well, but I really want to actually enjoy playing instead of it being a chore. I think I’m past 600 right now, or there abouts. I just miss being able to sit on my ass for hours and genuinely enjoy the game. I could sit in the D1 strike playlists for hours. At the core my problem is that I just don’t enjoy destiny anymore. I think I have MMO fatigue. 
---
He is on my desk mocking oryx
---
Yep
---
Cause everyone else already got it
---
I would like to go all Dredgn(spelling?)  on his punk ass for causing me trouble.
---
Annoying how much they neglect there pvp base since forsaken. If I didn’t have apex I’d be quite mad. Also they better not have another paid expansion in d2 too focus on it. Most of us have jumped ship. 
---
Keep at it, you'll get there mate
---
Yes always worth it, especially because there are going to be power surge bounties later and jokers wild. These bounties get you all the way up to 640 and make it able for you to play the new dlc and black amoury, 
---
Because its easy
---
Imagine a destiny where there’s zero damage fall of at range.
---
Now imagine you have an absurdly accurate hand cannon with a good fire rate that requires 2 shots and then you die to a dot
---
You have the Y1 thorn everyone remembers 
---
(It was also the hardest quest line in the game for a considerable amount of time)
---
Well done, took me like 13-15 hours of doing gambit matches and it was painful 
---
Is that it? 
---
Kinda... I mean.. it sorta looks like Ana Bray.
---
Thanks for replying, just figured that out at the castellum, awesome
---
Remember the boss in the EDZ corrupted strike? yea make him as big as an ogre and that's the 20 mote blocker,a giant boss phalanx
---
I have almost the same problem.
---
Around a month ago updated my drivers to latest,and the Destiny started to drop fps randomly from 60 to 35.
---
Shits me so so much. One even managed to kill it while four others of us frantically tried to freeze the damn bastard before the blueberry killed him. I mean have a look around please!
---
got my fabled the last sunday, it is satisfying.
---
Last word got a faster ttk then lunas
---
Can anyone guide the op to LFG? 
---
"But you will still loose out against lunas and nf." Hell no... You can outplay everybody. 
---
You'll get there bb. Believe in the ALRIGHT ALRIGHT ALRIGHT 
---
It's a medium sized pillar with a big tree next to it. It's the same level as the spawn and should be just down one of the paths if I remember correctly
---
Ohhhhh I think I saw one in the ViDoc, makes sense now, that’s cool
---
I can taste the superiority complex in this comment
---
You sound like Ada. 
---
Ok I took a break about 2 weeks ago- besides a little crucible. I always watched for the rabbit to run across at that bend, and this immediately looked different when I got to it. Wonder what it means.
---
I hadn't picked up the bounties when mine dropped, i was in the quest step for rekindle the flame, at volundr and it dropped for me
---
Got it on my second run, no justice for some :(
---
Honestly, if it's a weapon with good rolls, or you simply really like it, I'd say yes. I carried my No Turning Back bow from, well, whatever power level I was when I started Forsaken, all the way up to a 650 masterwork. It was still my principle top slot until I got Wishender a couple of months back. Nothing wrong with a bit of sentimentality.
---
Sorry man, but that’s a no 
---
It's most likely a glitch, I haven't had this particular version but I have had it where neither side had any enemies spawn at all 
---
Whatever you say mister. I'm ready to fist him 
---
 **༼ つ ◕\_ ◕ ༽つ GIVE JOKERS WILD ༼ つ ◕\_ ◕ ༽つ** 
---
Damn. Just fucking send a hive god to the other team. That would be even more brutal if it just forced them to do crotas end before they could bank lol. 
---
Could do it just as fast with prospector before s6, after the buff grenade launchers are getting tday itll be even faster 
---
Guess who has Tuesdays off and is already awake like it's Christmas 2: Christmas Harder!? THIS GUY!
---
And the forges
---
I got my quest yesterday im working on it too
---
You will be fine obviously you’ll have to buy dlc to get the best experience but there are power surge bounties coming with jokers wild which can get you all the way 640, and if you don’t have any other friends there is always an lfg on the companion app and other websites/apps. And you probably wont get stomped by other players in crucible as obviously light doesn’t matter and as long as you got to xur everyweek you can egt exotics pretty fast and exotic quests are grindy but you can cokplete them as crucibel uses a lot of meta weapons as well you will have to grind for that god roll
---
The yellow one scares me
---
As one of those players that can stomp in qp I completly disagree
---
Dont get me wrong I know that this can be unfair but listen me out...
---
Imagine being me, right...SBMM will put you against tryhards that are quite good 24/7 and game basicly becomes sweat fest with no place to chill
---
For players like me qp is a place to relax where we dont need to think about our plays and its way more relaxing to play
---
I understand your frustration but if you wanna fair games with SBMM you can try Rumble or weekly rotating game mode (they both have SBMM) or competitive
---
PS sorry for bad english :]
---
Invaders can pick up enemy Motes tho so if you're not careful they could just get nicked
---
Congrats. Still waiting for my Geomags after 10+ Crowns of Tempest...
---
I'm gonna guess ... Collecter?
---
He always thinks that.
---
Of course you are going colledtor ;)
---
Well yeah if you STILL haven't unlocked them...
---
If you are missing the ghost, you still havent earnt it
---
Oh god oh fuck 
---
Sorry i meants sparrow and SHIP
---
God im special
---
The thorn quest is next week
---
they can fix that by making people assign their role before they que aka League of legends queing.
---
Add our guardian calling him a bastard or flipping him off before walking away &amp; cutscene end &amp; you got my upvote
---
Close enough for me to start complaining 
---
*boop!*
---
Don't you blaspheme in here!
---
Don't think they said what it will be 
---
Hating thorn while playing thorn.
---
Yeah basically that's just how we do it 
---
I'm tempted by 24/7 Jötunn, but the others sound so good too (and actually better overall for the team)
---
Sometimes the teams just start doing emotes :(
---
Ah yes, reminded me of beating a 6-stack in iron banner, won like 8/10 games against the same team. We were all solo, maybe a two-stack somewhere.
---
We even had a 260 power guy with us, bless him.
---
450 bright dust ist 450 bright dust.
---
Oh i got the malf but thank you :))
---
I have been grinding for jotuun for so long :(( But hey just got my third QB this week so yay for rng!!!
---
&gt;How do you get boosted up to 640?
---
We don't know the details yet, but in the Season of the Drifter video they showed some bounties for annual pass owners that the Drifter will give you that give gear at 640. 
---
&gt;Any one know anything about what that will effect? Pros, cons, different loot, different quests, etc?
---
We don't know yet! All we know is that it will exist. All information about Season of the Drifter, until this DLC releases in 2.5 hours, comes from the Bungie website. [Link 1](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/47648) [Link 2](https://www.bungie.net/en/pub/SeasonOfTheDrifter) [Link 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeM60lG5NGM)
---
Didnt notice an error code, it just said connection lost network error and then i tried to load back into gambit and it took a few minutes
---
It's my wallpaper. Just kidding, but it makes me laugh everyday. 
---
oOpS
---
Thats what i call exaggeration... First of all there are only a small amount of old exotics coming back. For example with black amory there was The Last Word, sure. But we also got Izanagis burden, Jotunn and Le Monarque. Thats 1 old to 3 new. And even if you see this as "lazy" I bet alot of old players appreciate some returning fan favorites and as you already mentioned, players who started with Destiny 2 will enjoy them for the first time.
---
And you make it sound like exotics are the only aspects of the game to look forward to. Honestly, since you can only equip 1 Exotic weapon and 1 armor piece at once most new exotics are only little gimmicks to play around with for one hour anyway and then you change back to your base loadout. From all the exotic weapons I have used only 50 % maybe.
---
New content in form of game modes, places to travel, raids and other activities have way more value than exotics alone. Exotics are merely tokens to work towards to at this point, which is completely fine.
---
Im personally appreciating the new pinnacle weapons way more, since they start to be pretty great and unique on its own, Like 1/2 exotics. And you can actually freely use them together with your rather static, must have exotic collection.
---
[This page has a chart that will answer your questions](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/47648)
---
What's wild in all of this is that you seem to think you speak for all players who dont make events heroic. Again, the original reason for making events heroic has been removed. So yes there is less incentive to do the heroic version. However thare are certain quests and bounties that require heroic events for completion.
---
Your logic toward not learning game mechanics in game being bad design is flawed. The raids dont teach you their mechanics, most people learn from the internet or sherpas. Same for the blind well, same for the forge, shattered throne etc. Most things are straight forward, but some events require learning the mechanics either from the internet or a friend. Or learning yourself by playing and discovering. 
---
It's very easy to see your passionate about this topic, which tells me you're a newer player who doesn't care to take time to learn things about the game. If you want to live in ignorance that's fine, but dont get upset when others call you out on it. 
---
Theres no excuse to not know how to do any event in this game, unless you are literally brand new to it. But you are expected to learn, and it's no one's job to teach you. Whether or not its useful to make.the event heroic is irrelevant. Learn it or get out of the others players way. 
---
I always end up being killed by the invader just as the timer is about to run out. Like I survived and somehow we run right into each other and boom I'm dead.
---
Also in the vidoc you see a user shooting some Hive with the Thorn at normal speed, its three head shots and you can see the gun light up like a rampage stack or kill clip
---
Aw dang, there's nothing worse than having to wait the 3 weeks for Shattered throne to be back 😖
---
Its never too late.congrats!
---
That fucking purple titan tho.
---
I did the same thing and then another 10,000 infamy to get a single extra light Vs light kill... 
---
Destiny is my only true love. There are many other games but destiny is my &lt;3 
---
I had no idea that was a part of the quest or I would have tried to do it last week.  I just got that quest step though :(
---
Oh well in two weeks it will be easier ;D
---
I've always met with bunch of randos for the weekly reset for the 3X lw+scourge runs as soon as weekly reset hits :/
---
Nice good choices, I'm going Breakneck/Huckleberry and Jotunn/Ikelos SG for my loadout as Reaper, both have worked quite nice for me 
---
Makes you really appreciate bungie.   All these new "big" games coming out and being so buggy and half of what was promised.   
---
Definitely I was just referring to the on going meme about “shooting the central blight does nothing, heroics are random”
---
QB is good for kills but I found it quite shit tbh so I changed off it and went back to using hammerhead 
---
You have no idea
---
I suspected as much on EA being EA...
---
E
---
Hunter gear especially
---
Definitely gonna happen solo queuing that's for sure, thankfully I think I'll have 1 of each with my usual fireteam, and solo queuing being a Reaper will be handy, just kill everything and hope people are picking up the motes
---
maybe they finally understood how shit these RNG+time -bound drops are
---
Ah gotcha, so it probably has Onslaught like Breakneck?
---
THEY COULDNT EVEN GET HIS ACTUAL VOICE ACTORS TO DO YHIS DEATH SCENE.
---
ALSO, HE DIED BECAUSE HE GOT IT ASS KICKED BY LOW KEVEL ADDS, THEN IN ANOTHER STUNNING MOVE, TOOK HIS GHOST OUT AROUND A CHARACTER HE KNEW WAS A SHARPSHOOTER.
---
HE WASN'T SILLY OR JOKEY. HE WAS JUST DUMB AND HE DIED BECAUSE OF IT.
---
Good job man, I just got mine the other night too. Whew.
---
I agree
---
I popped my golden gun during on Shuro Chi last week during a raid and she got melted before I pulled the trigger. So I shot a thrall with it.
---
Wait and see my dude
---
That’s people in my old clan right now. They’re messaging me saying shit like,
---
“Bro you *still* play destiny? Come play anthem it’s better and you’re like Iron Man”
---
And I tell them my reasons for not getting. Don’t get me wrong, it’s a fun game. But there’s too much that just doesn’t make it worth 60 bucks in my opinion. 
---
Also does good damage too! 1 shot can kill a small blocker, 2 for a large, and probably 3-4 for a large (if you leave them all alone)
---
Congrats! Saving bounties for the Legend&gt;Reset phase was a life saver
---
I only ever spend them if its worth it to do so. Hasnt been worth it in a couple o weeks.
---
At least your honest I can appreciate that. Avoid it or find a teacher to make it easier.
---
I seriously wish Bungie would put more glowing armor sets in the game I loved the anniversary set! 
---
Top tree tether is one of the BEST subclasses for hunter when combined with Orpheus rigs. As long as you tether a decent chunk of enemies, you recharge super instantly. I use it in gambit and strikes, I can super nearly every wave and twice on primeval, and that’s not counting the orbs generated that charge my allies’ supers 
---
I saw someone post the other day and they had 34 guardians killed. Plus over 100 enemies killed and over 100 motes deposited. 
---
I think I remember seeing some ppl posting up around 50 or so
---
K
---
Me and myclan were saying the same thing but he wore a groucho Marx disguise 
---
I'm at 37/40, but that's fine. Breakneck can be my first 650+ weapon.
---
Oh yeah thorn is the next exotic quest for annual pass right?
---
Yes. They won’t like you.
---
Guess I have some work to do😂 Thank you!
---
What heresy is this?
---
Spartan mk iv &amp; v amour is the best realized and most iconic armour in media and from a purely military standpoint it's by far the most practical futuristic combat armour to appear in a video game.
---
In my opinion.
---
Can you point to where reddit forces you to view and comment on posts? I can't seem to find it...
---
I usually google it by the event name 
---
Yep. That the next big quest we have lined up. 
---
Forgot how many motes, but my record is 34 havent seen anyone with more
---
For some reason I thought this person meant nightstalker with the multishot. I know people only call the single shot tethers, but the multishot also has a tethering visual effect, so sometimes I get a bit confosed when people say "tether**s**" versus "tether." 
---
Oh boi oh boi,
---
Im doing meself a amuse
---
Agreed, Anthem was not what it was hyped up to be.
---
Then again, when Destiny 2 Launched, it was pretty much in the same state that Anthem is currently experiencing... Lack of content.
---
Yes
---
Wait, when you say "with tethers," do you mean the one with multiple shots or the single shot? Because the single shot is great. The multi shot does deal good damage, but there's no reason to use the multi shot versus golden gun if what you want is damage. 
---
Is that like escape or something?
---
Just waiting for those gambit prime LFGs on day one "must have full gambit armor".
---
Yeah I am with you there man, the Lore in the Destiny universe is pretty awesome and very very deep. Its keep getting deeper too, which is awesome
---
Good call. Invasion portal is better than blockers (assuming your invader isn't potato). 
---
Heck yeah dude. Thorn was pretty bad in D1 PVP. And by bad I mean good; just a real nasty weapon 
---
Did you make it in time???
---
Cries in glowstick
---
sht you just outsmarted me 
---
it drops in 1 hour. 
---
Sidearms suck *cough cough* maybe except for rat king
---
There not doing the thing we’re they wait and stuff
---
The loot on public events is trash, heroic or not. It's also no the difficulty of turning the event heroic it's the time. Cryo pod can be done in 10 seconds normal, or it takes 5 minutes heroic. Ain't nobody got time for that.
---
He still has an hour. 
---
Seeing this just made me cringe at the amount of times I've got close 
---
That sounds like they have no idea how to play the mode. 
---
A blueberry does not designate level, they are simply someone who is not in your fireteam and as such show up blue on your radar. 
---
Most hunter will run either Bottom tree GG with nighthawk, or too tree night stalker with Orpheus rigs. Best to have both tbh, as some fights don’t need tethers. 
---
If you don’t have either exotic, Blade barrage is your best bet imo 
---
I'm just gonna say one thing. 
---
"ALRIGHT ALRIGHT ALRIGHT!"
---
Pretty much everyone thought the first DLC, Curse of Osiris, got old quickly. Slightly less people thought Warmind, the second DLC, got old quickly. Both of those now come with Forsaken when you buy it, and Forsaken is the one that everyone likes and you can invest many hours in. 
---
The annual pass, which comes after Forsaken, has mixed reviews. Overall, I think most people liked it, but it's all end game only, so many people who bought it that didn't play enough to exhaust the Forsaken end game didn't feel like they needed it. 
---
That is the player I figured, but I really hope it's The Crow.
---
No, it’s locked behind faction rallies and those haven’t been around in a while
---
I'm no longer comfortable having this conversation. Can you please address any future conversations to HR or Legal. 
---
And then they say some stupid shit like *I'm not even paying attention because bounties*
---
This is a repost but ok
---
You can
---
I just played the last Mission of the Osiris dlc and the second i killed the last Boss the game stopped. I didnt know about an update. Fml
---
Now if only the servers weren't full
---
Way ahead of you.
---
Petra really needs to start accepting baryon boughs.  I have thousands of them.  I know the day I trash them, she'll want them for a new rep grind.
---
Trying to log on, but apparently the servers are still down? 
---
Anyone else experiencing this? I'm on the east coast
---
Lucky. Congrats haha. Ive actually been trying to reach this the past 3 weeks. Got stuck half way through Heroic 3 and couldn't get out of that rut. 
---
RIP my competitive career lol
---
Yep and also on the east coast 
---
Not very relevant neither useful for a lot of people I can guess, but I was looking for the order the platforms appeared to explain it to friends that never completed Eater of World, and came across  [u/RCMUSH-Senzo's](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/7kvmht/eater_of_worlds_lair_reactor_platforms_map_very/) post, and tried to make it into a more visually appealing map, hope it can still help some people !
---
RIP white glowy boi
---
ttv btw Pepega
---
Just use the same shaders over other pieces of gear... it sucks ik. If you have the chest, mask, cape, those are the best pieces.
---
I am especially fond of the accusatory tone.  "You left..."  No, I didn't, you're crappy software kicked me.  I never have DC problems on any of the other games I play.
---
I'm sorry to ask this here, but my question doesn't deserve it's own post.
---
Whereisxur.com says he'll be around for a whole week.
---
I can't be at my computer right now, but my phone says he's gone. I'm just wondering whether he's there or not
---
REEEEE
---
West Coast. Server are down apparently. Ps4
---
This is a perfect use of this meme. 
---
I only realised yesterday that I was on Mythic 1 from casual play throughout the season so I was like FUCKIT and grinded the best I could to get to fabled in solo queue. Solo queue being the cancer that it is I had a 10 loss streak after a few decent wins which cost me big time/made me want to kill all humans 
---
60$? I thought I got it for 35
---
Awesome this is the sort of opinionated summary i was looking for.  Any comments on the current state of itemization youd like to share?
---
Seems to me you're wearing some mighty heavy preemptive smarty pants today.
---
Go pull someone else's chain would you.
---
Restart the Xbox.... Then you can download the update.
---
I thought it was a general buff, as the inventory item icon is the same as the mod icon.  The game UI threw me off.  Once I realized you have to convert it, then I applied it to hammerhead and other weapons (now doing the riddle quest now, where you have to be full armory gear/weap).
---
your right I’d never send a message like that unless I thought he was being a jerk on purpose. I’m pretty sure he was doing it to be a dick.
---
Also, people with disabilities play super competitive FPS team shooters? Seem kinda mean tbh?
---
No
---
Yes it's down for me as well so it's not just you
---
I’d go with a slower one to make sure every archetype of cannon can finish with a headshot
---
Who actually explains this to anyone? "Jump on the plates, follow the leader. Have fun"
---
Season of the Alright 3x is here bois
---
BANK AT 5
---
Solo queue decided to deliver me a 10 loss streak it was horrendous, had a team mate that kept invading WITH MOTES and getting killed instantly 
---
Cries in not owning forsaken
---
That’s what I’m hoping for
---
Yeah I'm crap at crucible 
---
y'all wanna play anthem for a few days until the servers come back on?? 
---
Overly sensitive too. Oof.
---
Lol I am coming back to my PS4 and checking every 2 mins
---
I invaded with 6 motes returned with 10. 
---
lets be bad guys is moving rooms
---
Update incoming 
---
But they also buffed a crapton of stuff. This looks like balancing - there has been an ongoing issue where whole weapon classes were essentially useless because a couple classes were head and shoulders above in performance. 
---
I can’t speak on Whisper because I don’t have it, but the machine gun nerf really doesn’t look bad. It’s a perk balance so it was probably giving more than Bungie intended.
---
I suggest messing around with the stuff they buffed and see how it does; now there should be more options for viable load outs. 
---
What's the first step? I can't remember.
---
It's ok, when I started crucible I would get sleeper'd and telesto'd every day 
---
Every. Damn. Time.
---
I tried but it's too long, sorry
---

\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^

We should be thankful that he is disabled, with arms and legs he'd take *all* the women.

Congrats man!

Once again, clan XP in Season 6 can be earned simply by completing activities

---
Magazine perks and mods no longer affect ammo reserves
---
The Quick Access Sling mod can now be applied to any archetype; this change also allows it to be applied to the Mountaintop

Memento Mori
---
Fixed an issue where the Ace of Spades perk Memento Mori did not refresh when using the Hunter's Marksman Dodge ability

Note: These fixes make it so that reloading Ace of Spades no longer wipes Memento Mori on reload, but you can still refresh Memento Mori when reloading after a kill

Activities
---
Gambit
---
Activities hosted by the Drifter have been moved to their own sub-page on the Director called "Gambit"
---
Added Gambit Private matches for all Forsaken owners
---
Expect Gambit Prime Private matches on April 2, 2019
---
Overhauled how invader spawn points are chosen while also significantly increasing the number of invader spawn points for each map
---
Chances of spawning very near or in direct line of sight of an enemy Guardian has been greatly reduced
---
Changed the third round of Gambit to a Primeval rush sudden death; this will speed up Gambit matches overall and add a change of pace to the final round
---
The Primeval is immediately summoned
---
Player Supers/grenades/ability/melee are immediately filled, so both teams are on an even playing field
---
Super/grenade/ability/melee regen are increased for the remainder of the round
---
The Ascendant Primeval Servitor's (meatball) spawn rate is no longer tied to the curse cycle and has been greatly increased
---
Idle Protection: Players who remain dormant for too long will not receive end-of-match rewards or Infamy points
---
Made adjustments to Blocker types by deposit tier
---
Small Blocker = Taken Goblin with less health than the previous Phalanx
---
Medium Blocker = Taken Captain with more health than the previous Knight
---
Large Blocker = Taken Knight with more health than the previous Ogre
---
Gambit Matchmaking
---
Teams are now always broken up when re-entering the matchmaking pool after a match
---
Previously, when a match ended, players who did not return to orbit would be sent back to the matchmaking pool together; this is no longer the case
---
This will greatly reduce the likelihood of re-matching against the same players and will give matchmaking an opportunity to find the best possible match
---
Infamy
---
Players can now earn Infamy points by completing Gambit Prime matches and bounties
---
Increased the Infamy point rewards for Gambit matches by 25 points
---
Gambit HUD 
---
The HUD status bars now animate when returning from aim-down-sights
---
The Invader Portal Ready icon and animation on the status bar has been updated to be more pronounced and understandable at a glance
---
Triumphs and Medals
---
“Light vs. Light” can now be progressed by killing any Guardian (not just invaders) using a Super; this makes attaining Dredgen a less daunting task
---
The "First to Block" medal can now trigger once per round, previously it could fire only once per match
---
General Fixes
---
Fixed an issue where post-invasion kills during Primeval phase weren't giving the invader credit for healing the Primeval
---
Fixed an issue where VO lines indicating the high-value target was killed and that the high-value target got away will both play if the player kills the HVT just before it is removed from the arena
---
Fixed an issue where players would get the "Half Banked" medal every time they deposit Motes after they reached 38 Motes deposited
---
Fixed an issue where the "Taking Turns" medal fires when 3 different players invade instead of 4
---
Fixed an issue where a graphical error could be seen on a waterfall in Legion's Folly
---
Fixed an issue where occasionally Drifter would tell players back-to-back that the other team has summoned their Primeval
---
Fixed an issue where, in a longer match after killing the Primeval, the Drifter reminded us that we needed to spawn our Primeval to win
---
Fixed an issue where the bounty "Block and Key" did not increment when a Large Blocker was sent that would summon the Primeval
---

Max nine ammo from 20
---
(reserve ammo is now 9 instead of 21)
---
so I've heard.
---
I've always been thankful to be a PC player, but even more so now.
---
Reduced max ammo reserves from 20 to 9. You can increase it with the correct ammo perks. 
---
This really isn’t a nerf. 
---
Reduced the maximum ammo backup from 20 to 9
---
Spoiler tag this man. Damn.
---
That's usually what I do too. If I'm having a bad game motes wise, I'll dedicate to clearing from afar and defending from invaders and then invading when the portal's up. 
---
It is?
---
Sure don't care for the Machine Gun changes.
---
Honestly, it's still not that bad.
---
As long as you don't miss often... you still have infinite ammo.
---
Did Yongyea tell you that?
---
Whats the perk???
---
i miss thorn meta
---
"Alright alright alright, let's see what we've got."
---
"Deals! Bring a wallet."
---
Was just about to ask you about this because I searched you on wasteondestiny.com and your hunter was there. Glad to hear it wasn't permanent. Unfortunately the other guy who lost his char seems to still not have it.
---
You don't need sleeper if you have skill

This was the choice I had to make last night when I was one triumph and reset away from dredgen last night...
---
I was late to work today..
---
Yeah I have, nightingale error is a general networking exception. Nightingale basically means that d2 can't reach bungie servers for some reason.
---
It sounds pretty fuckin cool but really niche, i hope its good
---
Same especially bc in my country its in 7 pm not am
---
Hunters should just get an arc staff that they can spin around like a helicopter to get around. 
---
Damn those ammo nerfs are ridiculous. Sleep now has a max of 9 and so does whisper? Tf is this shit
---
Yo advice if you're soloing, use Telesto in the elevator for Psions, go high resilience and just run around. Hit the big ones with the orbs then use heavy/primary pulse to kill them. Itll take you maybe an hour to get through that, less if you're lucky. The ogres are easy, just use a pulse and a hand cannon. Stay near the stairs at the start. Once you get to the final boss, find the 'cheese' spot. Just search it up on YouTube. Use Polaris Lance and Hammerhead. Shoot the boss in the head with Polaris until the goblins spawn and farm them for heavy. Get out, Steal the heavy. It doesn't matter if you die here, getting the boss down with the cheese spot and Polaris is actually pretty easy. Just make sure you have at least 2 mags for Hammerhead. Once you've got that continue hammering the boss till he's at one bar. Here, two wizards will spawn. One behind where the boss should be if you're standing at the cheese spot, and one directly behind the cheese spot. What I did was immediately destroy the wizard behind the boss, just to the island on the left and use the rock on it as cover, and destroy the second wizard by peeking cautiously. All in all,  this took me three hours. One of the best challenges in the game for a solo player. Hope this short guide helps.
---
True of course, just means you gotta get gud
---
wait... wut! 
---
Same problem
---
It’s honestly so stupid
---
OnePunch em
---
Ugh. My phone hid it. Damn. Sorry bud. Guess I'm just straight up staying off until I get home.
---
Yeah he’s wearing his armour so it probs is him. 
---
You know that was proven false right? 0 consoles have been bricked. While force shut offs are not acceptable it's also just as bad to claim something without it being true. Reboot safemode, it does the format thing and it's good to go. Just like pulling the power cord. 
---
I dont think its okay by any means but then again most people just throw up their hands and say its broke when they dont know what's actually wrong. 
---
I got placed into a match that ended during my transition screen. Loaded straight into a blank results page with no names and no way to exit... got the same shit when I had to change characters. 
---
This gun is why I finished Malfeasance. Sad to see it be needed, but I understand why. Way too aimbot for its own good.
---
I feel like I'm one of 3 people who is actually ok with the Whisper nerf
---
Yeah not to happy about that, really sucks for Sleeper Stimulant ( that poor gun just keeps getting nerfed, even though i hardly seen anyone use it anymore) but they boosted the damage of Wardcliff Coil by a ton! 
---
Really upset to see Whisper get nerfed, hopefully they buff the armor perk reserves for it!
---
cant wait for a 6v6 thorn shotgun BS
---
That's entirely too rational of a response. Are you sure you play Destiny? 
---
The whisper nerf literally doesn't affect you if you can hit shots. It has two perks that give back ammo for free on hits and misses. Machine guns were too good against bosses and ads that they made it weaker against bosses.
---
Yes and dc well bounty on all characters. I didn't save any of them also it's broken
---
Okay, you're right. It Isn't bricking them.
---
Nah bro, functionality is better in all cases
---
It won't be the game mode that sucks..just your teammates.
---
127 shards!? Just kidding, fair play dude, enjoy!
---
MyNameisByf on youtube. Excellent channel.
---
Great! Now I just need to wait a few months until he sells the Geomags...
---
And last night the Anthem GF had a stroke and bricked the relationship, so now he is free to follow his heart!
---
Just don't miss 4head
---
Even then its still way to strong. Just either male it a titan fortracer or a titan wormhusk or make it so you require two kills within a stort time to proc it.
---
Best feature:
---
 Xûr Has the possibility of selling Forsaken Exotics 
---
Yeah it does a hard drive scan on rebooting, which happens whenever hard drive loses power or doesn't shut down properly.
---
Not the only one. I think the new armor looks like a middle-schooler's PC build 
---
&gt;!Please let us warlocks have something nice for once.!&lt;
---
You expect me to get good? Pfft 
---
Ohh boy will of the thousands and strange terrain, been a long time /s
---
Agree it’s a nerf but not a big one you only need 3 bullets anyway 
---
Why would that make him feel better?
---
A tax return commercial.  Not that stupid frase is stock in my head lol
---
If you have good enough aim the amo is still infinity 
---
Sucks but not surprising, just less room for error now 
---
Bungie doesn't like to give the numbers.
---
EZ
---
r/195
---
Thanks
---
I mean, just hit your shots as necessary and ammo economy isn't an issue right?
---
That whisper nerf is insane
---
“Drifter?”
---
“It’s Dröfter now! Bank those mötes”
---
Tatara Gaze FINALLY
---
I do remember visiting Ada right before maintenance and it sai her bounties weren’t refreshing for another 7-8 hours. Check later tonight and see if the update?
---
Had a really hard game the other day where I ended up practically soloing the spawns, didn't even click that I hadn't died until I got the triumph at the end. 
---
Funnily enough I had another game the next day where for some reason the enemy invaded like once all game and my team just murdered everything but hardly picked up any motes. The whole game was like a casual jog.
---
Well said. Might be a $40 game currently, and also might be really good in 6-12 months. But those are hypotheticals, and Destiny 2 is in a great place right now. Took a year after launch to really find its place and shine, which is a whole other conversation concerning half finished games (destiny 2 wasnt quite that issue really, Anthem definitely seems to be though).
---
Seems to be an easy decision. Wait for Anthem to add more content and fix bugs, play Destiny 2 and Division 2 in all their glory. Its a great time to be a gamer.
---
Hmmmm.... So i need to check each of them in their location?
---
And you would think with how many fuck ups Bungie had with their game BioWare would learn from that and improve on it in theirs...
---
If you were smart, this would be your reward for studying so hard.
---
They have mentioned this was going to happen on like, 3 different weekly updates over the last month. I think there might have even been an in game news announcement about it.
---
Bingo. Cramming never made sense to me.
---
They stated multiple times that this would happen, starting three weeks ago.
---
discord.gg/d2
---
What about the machine gun frame for fucks sake, I've been waiting for it for such a long time.
---
It is certainly very helpful but not 100% recommended 
---
was still better than anthems launch i dont remember d2 turning consoles into $400 paperweights and having to issue refunds.
---
Everyone received an in-game message warning them of this beforehand. It's unfortunate that it had to be done this way, but I assume that it was the best workaround they could find to solve the problem they were trying to fix
---
Lmao it’s back now 
---
[PATCH NOTES ](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/47677) 
---
Only things that they specifically state get deleted, get deleted. I know it sucks, but in the future you should probably look at patch notes and news updates if you are going to try gaming the system by doing stuff like saving bounties. 
---
It's gotta be like a "yes/no" radial button or something.
---
Is there an actual trailer like this? If there is someone link me it please
---
Isn't that the weapon you get for unlocking the second forge? Or is that sniper rifle random?  Im just curious because I just got that yesterday 
---
Really well put together and easy to understand. Nice job!
---
I wonder if the changes you mentioned are a bad thing? Change can be hard for the core community, but new players, revenue, &amp; marketing could be the difference in millions. The 3rd person cosmetic revenue is just massive.
---
This meme is dank.
---
Should be NSFW
---
*DOOFUS
---
GRATS! 
---
I bet that was some serious PVP action. 
---
Has this happened to other people?
---
Lul
---
No, dude. My main hunter build is dual sidearms, and I can do as much work as any other weapon. Unpopular opinion, I know, but seriously, they are good.
---
Well it’s wiped my bloody titan off the face of the earth so. Fucking kudos to bungie for this update
---
Thank you! Sorry for bothering but do you know the dates for when you can get Whisper of the Worm too? Sorry for being a noob but I really want it! 
---
Did anyone else's weekly bounties from Ada not reset this week? Mine say they've already been completed after the reset.
---
Lol how long HAS strange terran been on the NF rotation list? 
---
As of yet, I’ve found nothing on reddit or bungie that would indicate such
---
A month or so ago, Whisper of the Worm changed to being available 24/7, from any public event in Lost Oasis instead of just taken blights. 
---
I **highly recommend* looking at multiple different guides, and finding teammates, before attempting Whisper. It is totally normal to fail it a few times before you finally get the gun. 
---
This is the key. Destiny lacked content but was made well. Now that we have content, it'll never be stopped until someone can out gunplay them. 
---
\*cries in fellow titan main\*
---
Bungee recently said all sweaty NF titan OEM tryhards shall be slaughtered
---
Yeah that kindve makes the armor irrelevant then if that’s true. Would be unexpected because I feel like a lot of the hype has been built around that
---
Thanks for the reply.
---
I dont mind those resets, but those pulse rifle kills for the few first steps would drive me crazy. 
---
r/whoosh lol
---
Holy fuck. I am so sorry about that shit. I don't have hopes for support helping you, but best of luck anyway.
---
Gonna make insurrection prime hard for me since I always miss the shields with whisper which leaves me worth almost half ammo
---
Is that pic from tails gets trolled? 
---
Actually I just haven't been on to turn them in.. zero reason to log in over the last couple months.. but nice of you to assume I was going to "game" the system. 
---

I was thinking of going Devour Warlock again, and using Collector set.
---
Im on PC
---
I hope so. I don’t see how it’s possible though. 
---
Hell, how you can block something with sword? What combination I should use on keyboard???
---
And why the hell normal gambit counts as competitive?
---
Works for me PC, NA.
---
*pause* not
---
Sounds good for crucible. Maybe Forges 
---
&gt;And why the hell normal gambit counts as competitive?
---
I must find this devil magic and implement it
---
It's only because I'm at work and not struggling to download the update at home. :-(
---
It’s still gonna be good, just not *as* good. 
---
What would you have wanted for $10ish worth of DLC?
---
Thank
---
[removed]
---
Which they should put it according to the roadmap. For the moment I’m not even considering buying it. Imagine getting banned for  doing the loot cave.
---
Why? Don't like the fancy purse?
---
Yes, I noticed as well. Seemed like awkward frame rate issue but I checked, still at 60hz. Weird. 
---
Can't wait to rule over peasants with an iron fist
---
I agree about raids, they are fun but getting a group takes a long time and the raids timing are very tight and leave zero room for error.  People get pissy pretty quickly.  At least with Gambit you can pickup and play in minutes.  If you are having a bad time, you can quit without screwing your raid group over
---
It looks ok.
---
I'm always curious why people do this? I always just spend my shards on random crap haha (not that it's worth it either). 
---
It had its time. A time when no other weapon was used but this. Let some other weapon/s bubble to the top so it doesn’t get stale again 
---
Related -- I'm kind of curious if you can get these on multiple characters? I just started a week ago, and have been grinding the 500+ shit, and these were a fucking godsend. If I start my 2nd character and use the level boost...can I go do these bounties on the new character?
---
No worries my brethren
---
My strat usually works, we kill the invader before he kills us. 
---
What
---
Got 241 shame no way to show it tho in game
---
Have you heard about how Anthem’s bugs are bricking PS4s?
---
Me neither ;-; I have the stuff I need and burn all my legendaries and only spend them on the daily enhancement core from spider and the odd collection I take back out 
---
Tbf it will still be an absolute beast for bosses, but it's just not as potent for situations with a high propability of missing.
---
Imo a nerf but all in the wrong places as long as the raid encouunters keep holding still
---
They also made it hit harder and have tighter pellet spread. Overall this gun still got a buff. Just not as big as the other shotguns 
---
I know but why slow it down like that. It doesn’t feel good to use at all now
---
And i cannot find this exact info in the notes could you help me where is it exactly? :)
---
Crazy, I can’t find any. How tf do we tell Bunghole this?
---
Ahhh I started pain and guilt on Sunday and just got to upward turn last night! I’m excited to hopefully get Luna’s this week. Even with new content today!
---
One bugged bounty means her weekly is also impossible to complete. So yeah, kinda puts a hitch in the whole "reach 700 ASAP" issue.
---
Also Bergusia is something I've been doing for weeks now but now I can't for no good reason and it wasn't in patch notes.
---
Exactly, I really wish bungie could work out some way of doing a 3 man style version of the raid. Maybe just a slimmer experience that would give people like myself a shot at some of that loot. Things as they stand now are just too time consuming for me personally to arrange everything. 
---
People always going to complain about this, join an LFG and group up.  Stop asking them to change something that reduces matchmaking times.
---
 [u/title2imagebot](https://www.reddit.com/u/title2imagebot) 
---
They slowed down all full auto shotguns, but increased their damage. 
---
I'd like a new Raiden Flux because I've only got the unflinching auto rifle aim static roll lol.
---
Metal middle finger, very heavy metal
---
It's going right to the vault, now. Along with Sleeper, Hammerhead and Thunderlord. 
---
2TFox, Wardcliff and all them grenade launchers though...
---
Any other exotics?
---
Bungie forcing us to step out of the box. Plus make other weapons viable for boss killing. I don’t like it either but rebalancing is going to happen from time to time and it’s always going to piss off someone. I got butt hurt when scouts took a nose dive 
---
I haven’t heard of any bans, what are you referring to?
---
Huh?
---
Yo you're the best. I was just about to ask to same thing...i just checked, and there is 4 hours and change till hers reset. Much obliged guardian
---
Hindsight, probably wasn’t the best choice to make right before the heckin’ Season of the Drifter. 
---
I know theres a Titan gauntlet because I got the ornament for it, a hunter gauntlet that gives an improved melee when you get meleed or using an arc melee ability
---
What activity do you absolutely need Whisper infinite ammo on where you can’t plan ahead and communicate with your warlock?
---
Yup
---
This is the shit communities like r/destinythegame cause. All they do is cry and complain for everything to be nerfed and we shit like this and the ikelos shotgun. Fuck I hate that sub. 
---
Why
---
Wow. I need it right now
---
Did it get nerfed too?
---
No i'm trying to get the Luna's howl
---
man if it got 80 and 26 with its 2 missiles, holy moly that thing will be an absolute beast! 
---
I assume it's to counter the fact that people destroy raid bosses with whispered breathing. It's far less forgiving now if you miss a shot
---
thanks, I didn’t know i had to press details. I was frustrated for a minute
---
Fair point, I can totally see why you feel that way end of d1 was great. But it's hard to disagree that d2 is in a good spot and it's only getting better 
---
For a guy who's terrified of The Last Word, he sure seems desperate to have it.
---
You're welcome 😊😊😊
---
excuse me?
---
Maybe find 3 friends, probably gonna be tough with that attitude though 
---
! HAHA SAME HELP ME
---
Yep, and it's a big one: -21% damage against majors and bosses
---
It's nothing new I've had this problem regardless of new season You just get a match that's impossible and you lose. Also the player left after the match ended.
---
I'm pretty sure the forums is the only way, that's customer support in 2019 for you.
---
Yeah you read that right
---
april fools lol?
---
I wish
---
They did. Rockets got a massive boost to their projectile. Warcliff coil is a monster now. And grenade launchers got a buff as well. The only ones that really got hit with a nerf were Heavy Machine Guns and Whisper. Rockets with cluster rockets are the same as well. The damage was just moved to the projectile. 
---
And yeah that’s the point. I think DARCI actually our damages Whisper on several encounters if you don’t have to reload ( or the window for damage is very short). There are some weapons that I prefer in some moments over the meta ones. 
---
like i said, you match players based on glory. not kd or kda. so either specify what u want fixed to bungie in forums or twitter rather than reddit cuz i dont even think they check reddit lol
---
I mean, it's their game and they can make whatever changes they please if we're being real. They don't have to be "your parents" to make changes when they see fit or feel it is necessary.
---
maybe reset wifi or make sure destiny can get through your firewall
---
Its the same reason they nerfed wardclif in y1. Pre nerf, it could take out the three canisters in the baths of the leviathan with one shot. They dont want people to use the cheese method so much. Same reason that cluster bombs got nerfed. 
---
Is there a gif or video of it anywhere yet?
---
People already did, though. Whisper was only used in bergusia and the last encounter of SOTP, maybe Morgeth sometimes. Thunderlord is way easier to use and just as effective on everything else. The nerf was nonsensical. Now that 1k and wardcliff were buffed, this is even more head stratching. 
---
:-+)
---
I have school from 8 AM to 6 PM on Tuesdays. Meanwhile, my remaining active clanmate has his spring break right now. 
---
90% or them
---
Danny Phantom, I see you are also a man of culture.
---
🥴
---
Reverie dawn set can roll with enhanced versions of armour perks (along with the Last Wish and SotP raid armour sets).
---
They said it will happen at season reset
---
*steve death sound*
---
For sure.
---
BRB checking my profile. Still loading companion app😰
---
They put out a message that said to turn all of those IB bounties in because they would be gone after the new season started. Sorry man. 
---
Every single time, I new dlc drops the blueberries come back
---
They said a few weeks ago, any saved bounties will be taken away. 
---
So close but yet so far
---
Just wait, the roadmap says the allegiance quest is coming later. 
---
*hello one enemy defeated*
---
What a really stupid nerf.
---
Why do they do these nerfs and buffs in such large swings?
---
*copying*
---
*one eternity later*
---
*servers are down for maintenance*
---
haha, how long did that take you to edit??
---
Because I like following what’s happening In the destiny community and in destiny 2
---
The huge nerf is actually Lunafaction. People with Lunafaction and the short Titan forcefield will now really hurt their team if people are using Whisper. It used to be a minor annoyance 'cause with 20 shots it didn't really matter if you used up 2/3 bullets 'cause the damage phase would usually be faster than shooting all your shots. Now it'll actually hurt the team. Big opportunity for people to troll.
---
For the lols
---
So pulled the fire rate down but buffed the damage.
---
Idk why yall act like im an idiot. Just curious sheesh
---
My bad. Thanks for the info!
---
Now I have to log on /sigh
---
Buy seeds from spider for shards, turn them in at brother Vance. Dismantle everything you get. 
---
The MW guns drop 2x cores, and the shaders he drops can be turned back into shards.
---
You get ~80% of your shards back out, and in return you get gunsmith parts and masterwork cores.
---
I setup a macro on my mouse for buying and dismantling, so I usually just load up some Netflix and go to town.
---
It's called shattered throne.
---
or just a good majority of human beings
---
I get that. But I was playing with it for the fire rate. Looks like I gotta go find a new shotty
---
(assuming your invader isn't potato).
---
(assuming Bill Clinton did not have sexual relations with that woman)
---
(assuming Germany wasn't going to militarize post World War)
---
The chances are literally 1 in a million.
---
Might as well go buy a scratch off.
---
Thank G\*d that finally, after 6 long weeks, Hammerhead is finally in the frame rotat-
---
Those are just goblins
---
I'm sure it'll get better with time but right now, barely anyone in my matches looks out for one another. I mean, they barely did in Gambit Classic but it's more apparent now. Anyway, I like it! I could see it keeping our interest far longer than the Forges, and not just to complete triumphs.
---
I think harder tiers will be a lot more complex/mechanical, they will definitely be higher light. On the other hand ye, it's a wave based horde mode.
---
Love it much more than regular gambit. 
---
Exotic launcher were mentioned to get a separate pass for damage last week, so it’s probably just the 26%. The thing to remember is that you have 2 rockets that are getting the buff on Two Tail, though.
---
He still is but he likes to be call lord because is shorter
---
I'm loving Anthem.  A few bugs but being one who played Destiny from day one I can tell you people seem to have forgotten what a pain Destiny was back then.  D2 vanilla content...I played for maybe a week and was done.  People don't want to be "burned" by anthem but D2 was the worst I've ever felt burned.  When I got Forsaken with Osiris and Warmind for $20 I felt like I had recouped a little of the $60 I wasted on D2.  When I max leveled D2 and got bored I went looking for about anything else.  Anthem has filled the gap.  With the drifter falling soon I might go back.  Don't forget all the times we sat like dogs at the bungie table just praying for a scrap to fall.  
---
Can’t beat my double aeon swifts! But seriously congrats man 👌
---
just use a warlock
---
/s of course, warlocks arent useable thanks to hunter complaints
---
When it’s 74 to 75 but the guy who has 9 notes is going for 10
---
I wouldn't hold your breath..he'll be back within a week once he sees that Anthem is hot garbage in comparison.
---
True 
---
I agree . Other games handles this 10x better. 
---
What happens if they also have a PvP loadout though ...?
---
This happened to me the other day.
---
Mine is back now though.
---
Reach out to cosmo, super useful guy.
---
Still useless
---
Looks like Vienetta
---
Bungie higher-ups:
---
&gt; Reddit won't shut up about our lack of new content! GET ON IT!
---
Bungie devs:
---
\* simply reuses parts of a weapon model as a ghost shell \*
---
&gt; Meh, good enough. Ship it.
---
I've tried it out without the macro by just using the scroll wheel  , its still the same speed as with a macro 
---
Same here.  All 3 characters.  Luckily I had 2 balistics logs already on my warlock so I can at least get that going.
---
I just want you to know im not just pointing at you, idk how you play but with most people, shotguns arent situational they are a lifeline all game long, comp or not. Now im not as good at sniping as some people ive saw clips of but its not just camping in the back. The whole point of practicing is knowing where they are going to peek even close-ish range and pop them in the head before they can react. If your getting shot at, quickly change position in your cover and bam. Most people cant adjust that fast. Its not a good lone wolf strategy ill admit, but if you have a decent team it works pretty well. 
---
Im just saying that ill be ok with them making shotguns less of a dominate weapon in pvp. And im going to disagree with sniper shots being rng. I mean yeah if your getting blasted in the face it probably isnt gonna land but i guess dont do that. I hope bungie realized certain things needed tweaked, we'll see.
---
Nice try.
---
This wasn't about politics until you yelled out libtard.
---
That showed me your level of class and decorum. Typical of a trumpist. Like your great leader, you have no class or decorum
---
It’s a little servitor 
---
&gt;elete new D2 folder &gt; rename old d2 folder back from d2.1 to d2 , now open battlenet and it will still show initializing , but just for the proof open task manager again and you can see battlenet is using your Disk , now wait for a good 5-10 minutes and your Download bar will pop up again and you can see the download . i just fixed it for myself . so tell me if this works .
---
This worked!! The trick was to exit the app while the new download was running. Thanks so much!
---
Kinda off topic, but is there any chance anyone here could tell me how to get one of the ornaments for Sunshot? Or is that not possible anymore?

Typo sorry

Aah reminds me of my first game of gambit prime today i had 76 motes banked on my team. Needless to say but we lost 2 people were on 0. Solo queing sucks sometimes
---
Wondering the same. Cause I can't out them in

Sepiks Prime chrome

I, for one, am glad they nerfed both the EP Shotty and Whisper.  They were cool don't get me wrong but whats the point of playing a game that is all about getting loot if you're going to use the same 3 guns almost all of the time.  Midnight Coupe, Ikelos SG, and Whisper is dull.  Balancing like this gives reasons to use other weapons.

Yeah you can also read the patch notes that bungie released..? 
---
Yes 
---
Rail gun!
---
Bungie is aware of this bug and is fixing it, dont know how long it will take then tho
---
Mm, yes what?

Whenever I see the word Therapist, I see “The Rapist.

Nope it's still at 5, I'm pretty sure I'm just being dumb since it's been a while since I've played

i think trumps an idiot, and somebody who was on a reality tv show shouldnt turn around and decide to be president
---
Uh. Nice. Glad they are on it already. Although I've just seen another thread about the weekly light well bounty too. 
---
I wish lol
---
I’ll enjoy it more once I get my hands on that juicy thorn next Tuesday :)

I’m wondering how it works I did the daily heroic on titan as I needed it to go towards my wayfarer title. It gave a “powerful engram” I got a massive boost from 650 to 651 yay 
---
BEWARE!
---
This is what bungie did to me when I time traveled to the next reset so i had more chances at getting jotunn from the weekly forges. I believe it is just a punishment for breaking the economy.
---
Yes my dude everything powerful from BA is 650+
---
Nice looking graphic. Try a Scourge encounter 1 map, that'd be helpful and look good.
