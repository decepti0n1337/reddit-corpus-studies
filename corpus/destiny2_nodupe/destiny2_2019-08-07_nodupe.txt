Shot Sundance (Cayde’s Ghost) then uldren shot Cayde.
---
---
---
This one was a mix of the teleport w/ lion rampants and my teammates not ruining the shot by picking up a chest. I personally like this much more than the first one.
---
It's so powerful that it trivialises most endgame activities. The power creep of grenade launchers in general do. All GL's are probably gonna take the L at some point but mountaintop is a particularly notorious offender
---
How I unlock that profile cape?
---
What shotgun is that?
---
If you watch a video by ninja pups it's a good idea for weapons but for exotics mostly sixth coyote, stompees, and orpheus rig.
---
Nice.
---
.....uhhhh. okay?
---
What do you mean?
---
Honestly same.
---
Heck yeah
---
Nice
---
I played laser tag but was one day out on the deadline 😡
---
Also by combining a exo kinetix primary. Can easily overcome dps issue. Keeping a melting point w. Ikelos shotee and outbreak perfected or sunspot w calus mini tool (don tgot recluse) and arbalest. Pretty much handles all situations except special raid specialty weapon xhoices
---
This isn't Destiny related.
---
If you were at 2030 you should have stopped playing, that’s on you
---
Last year armour glow feels a bit more subtle in comparison
---
Alright good to know, I need to farm one myself. Thanks guardian
---
People just don’t understand that you have to capture and keep at least 2 zones to win in Control, not just kill hoard.
---
Yea, you just have to have done damage. Might not count if you only damage the shields, I always just make sure to get a couple hits of physical damage in case.
---
You need them to fly towards your opponents face and smash it with your knees of glory
---
No hes alright
---
is it even worth it tho
---
Also crazy you nearly had enough time to change batteries and come back with that potato shooting at you.
---
Yeah just saw a guy run around and tag them lol. Just so he will get the kill count
---
Sure it's a nice challenge, but when you need miniboss kills.. not so much :)
---
Probably trying to offload some stuff that’s technically not safe to sell.
---
Im back on D2 after playing the initial launch and getting incredibly bored incredibly fast. I was so dissapointed in D2 after throwing nearly 1000hrs on D1.
---

---
I reinstalled D2, played the first 2 DLC's and got Forsaken yesterday morning, played for 8 hours straight and loved it. Feels like Destiny again. I feel it is worth getting.
---
Good to know. Thanks for the update!
---
Ah it looks so good in this shader!
---
I stopped using shaders in D2, not sure why, but this makes me want to make an effort haha.
---
EAZ is legit the most toxic experience I've had in D2 so far. I'm at 87/100 and I can TASTE FREEDOM. FUCK this event.
---
Bonus points for Arby's- its niche but I still feel like it doesnt get enough love in crucible or gambit.
---
1/1000000 i will ever do that in my D2 career
---
I'm glad it was definitely hard to pick a shade that worked with all 3 ornaments.
---
I've been having this issue for the past week. Every day I need to shut it down and reset my router to no avail. Sometimes I get lucky, but most times I'm just stuck.
---
PEREGRINE GREEEEEAAAAVES!
---
Thank you so much! I've been wondering for so long!
---
All good the titan tastes like gunpowder and sweat
---
Yup since 4 finished work and wanted to shattered throne with arc burn rip never buying a digital game ever again
---
Make an alcoholic line, call it Hardlight.

---
Yo Xbox all day lol
---
I used to. No longer do i. It has been rightfully put in its place but i did abuse it to get my NF i wont lie.
---
Good job   i had to do a lot of reconing  because i didn't get any of the armor last season. So glad im done with it.
---
True but its going to happen.
---
If i can get a dust rock blues i will get my recluse someday
---
Get the specs of the printer and the print and put it on r/3dprinting, they'd probably love this!
---
Poop
---
I’m no pro or nothing but you’ll probably get a good power boost from starting up again.  I think I’m at 550-60 and haven’t bought any of the newest dlc. The cap is 750 now?
---
Because you're about as literate as a bucket.
---
I believe you’re referring to Solstice of Heroes armor sets?  Those are permanent I believe.
---
Buy them once and use for all characters
---
1 time purchase usable on Solstice gear infinite number of times. It's just like exotic ornaments
---
Forsaken will not be free.
---
It won't? I thought that it was gonna be free after shadow keep us released, and that they said every release after that will be free with the release of new content.
---
jesus sorry miss smith
---
What shader?
---
What platform you on though?
---
Ps4
---
I'd rather have that than some of less useful or more specific perks.
---
Pretty new light gives everyone a boost to 750
---
yes thank you,sorry for the late reply you were the only person that was correct,a silly mistake by me but hey thats destiny :)
---
I am loving the Graviton Lance. It feels so good shooting
---
Thor seems more like an element-confused middle tree sunbreaker. First he’s got the little hammer he throws, now he’s got that bigass thing he swings around and slams to summon lightning
---
Username checks out.
---
Am I the only one that prefers sleek armor to flamboyant?
---
I smell an ark farm 😂
---
You’d be better off using huckleberry in your primary if you don’t have recluse because energy guns aren’t great. 
---
Right now I’m almost to fabled for mine, but for PvE content I’m using Militas and Kindled orchid. PvP varies a bit, but usually service and any energy weapon I feel like or claperone and kindled, or outbreak and kindled.
---
Even without recluse you can do pretty ok for yourself, recluse just makes it a little easier
---

Yeah might be because you’re just doing more damage so you don’t need as many shots but who knows

You can open them and it will still drop rewards up till the scoreboard comes up.

Thanks!
---
You are correct

Please share. The EAZ is taking my soul
---
Heavy’s a much bigger issue in gambit tho, shotguns are eh but hand cannons are fair game i’d say I prefer them over pulses but maybe that cause i only use a snipe.

I'm mildly upset you called it " the destiny 1 trailer song" and not [The Immigrant Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqUkPzFmfxo)
---
When farming your solstice armor for your titan did you wait till your titan was level 50 to grab the armor and start the grind or do the grind for the armor while leveling up the character?
---
10/10 best dad ever
---
it's actually just a regular hammer but it's got the souls of 5 Stormcallers and a couple Chaos Reachlocks
---
Yeah, I just didn't like the blue tint it added to a few pieces, like the legs on my Hunter. I really like the overall look without shaders, but making it mostly white with gold accents is really awesome looking. I was honestly thinking of putting my favorite shader, Dawn and Dusk, but I like the white and gold better. I'm gonna keep looking for better ones, though
---
Does the trick still work to make the Arc glows green?
---
Get yourself 20 exotic engrams and go buy it then!...
---
instead we had to roll it lucky
---
Right I could have sworn I had one that was all white I'll post back after work which one it was.
---
what happened now?
---
He said fuck me in the ass and you are a girl wait what?
---
Well, the one I used for those few pieces was Monochromatic, but on the other pieces it took away the gold and made it mostly black. Midnight Talons looks pretty good, though. I'm still looking through them right now
---
Hammerhead needs more blueberries to satiate it's hunger.
---
Titan's can delete vertical velocity instantly now?
---
You're a *teeny tiny bit* late to that party.

Congrats man🎉
---
Keep that stupid player base out of my game thank you.
---
my favourite part of the jetpack is falling a massive height and burning all of the jet to slow the descent and only take a little damage.
---
i love glide but it's just not as situationally dramatic
---
Lol I'll try to respond to this the best I can. For you to rven allow yourself to type that sounds like you're not the most holy person yourself as that is also a trait or arrogance and being an asshole. There is irony there and I don't mean any offense to that. I've been a long time patreon of rust and he is the first to tell you he hates doing vocals on his videos because he doesn't have the fake youtube smile everyone puts off. He's one of the realest people you'll meet. Around Xmas he was doing a live stream and gave away his old Ps4 to a subscriber because he said he had to pawn it for financial reasons. Rust didn't even know the guy like that. Maybe he doesn't have the best voice for youtube but his knowledge and skillset is unmatched. Maybe you're mistaking his confidence in his knowledge and insight for arrogance. His channel currently has only a 2% dislike ratio and it's because he actually does work on the content he puts out for the community to HELP players gain an edge on their gameplay so they become more involved and can gain that same confidence in their gameplay. He's a hell of a guy. Sorry, but you have misjudged his character. He's just real no bullshit person.

[When you ignore Xur and chill by the jukebox](https://youtu.be/V9AbeALNVkk?t=147)
---
You should be running nightfalls dude
---
I’m poo poo at nightfalls, does the difficulty of the nightfall matter when it comes to getting catalysts?
---
I would love to set you 2 up against each other. See how many ads he "lets" you kill. Hhaha. He would make a fool out of you to the point where you may never play destiny again because of how soul crushing he would make your ego right now. Lmao. What is this gamertag of yours?
---
Not that I know of. Set it up for a speed run and do a lot of them.
---
Already said he has better ad clear than me. I know he's top 10 ad clear. With that one exception every other stat of mine is better...how are you not getting this?  
---
I'll give you a breakdown.  
---
11 Less hours played than me. 4.2k more enemy's killed. over 600 less blockers killed. nearly 400 less invaders killed. Nearly 2k Less motes deposited. 0.1 more mpr. 1,300 more motes lost than me and loses on average twice as many per round/match. We can ignore all the invasion stats since (unsuprisingly) he doesn't do that. 300 less smalls nearly 200 less mediums 200 more large(I'd hazard a guess that he dumps these only when the bank is open/is full). and a full 1million less primeval damage(skewed because of the primeval health changes a few weeks into prime, but with as much playtime as we have it averages out alright)
---
Awesome, I’ll give it a shot tomorrow. Also, do nightfalls have a higher chance of dropping them then the regular strike playlist?
---
absolutely no dispute that he kills things quicker than me? never claimed otherwise.
---
He doesn't play gambit anymore. That was only last season. What is your gamertag. I wanna see that you aren't bsing
---
my soul has shattered into a million pieces
---
Gamertag is: GayForBray. Stats have plummeted in the past week because i went for my reckoner title.
---
I believe so yeah. I got mine from inverted Spire nightfall. Momentum heavyweight and solar singe. Then just a couple shots from sleeper sim or 1k voices
---
Pop a reaper synth and do Gambit prime untill you've accomplished your weekly. I've gotten so many fucking shotguns from Gambit at this point but I've already gotten my god roll
---
I am so incredibly done with this entire thread. I wish him the best of luck, i hope his channel blows up and blueberries rock his builds i really really do. I'm sick of telling people juju is shit huckleberry can't hang etc etc etc. I don't like his attitude i don't find his video's entertaining because of his attitude. Informative yes. All this entire thread has done is show how fucking fanatic 3-4 particular fans are. nothing else. You claimed he does XYZ in gambit at a god tier level. I told+showed you im better at XYZ in gambit(and wouldnt claim to be the best at any by any stretch of the imagination). I said he's good(top tier even and far better than myself) at ad clear over and over and over. And in response you all just kept screaming how much better he is at ad clear than me? like really????????????  I like his builds. I like his guns. what do you all do?  tell me how amazing his bulds are.I don't like him. Thats the end of this entire conversation. Blocking ever one of you because honestly i cannot stomach this insanity and would prefer to never have to deal with anyone of you ever again.
---
He literally told us at the end of the campaign that if he didn't have the responsibility of being the vanguard leader he would've done it himself, also the city is still recovering from the red war, it's not as simple as that.
---
Rather impressive lack of map and general game awareness on the opposite team.
---
It’s such a large map with lots of twists and turns and hiding places.
---
The only game mode I can see working well in that area, and I hesitate to say it, is a battle royale. 
---
And I do not want battle royale in Destiny.
---
Please don’t do that. Why would you do that?
---
Huh?
---
Amazing work dude that's a solid trailer!
---
Nope.
---
It would be just a sniper fest...
---
Or rooftop duck hunt...
---
Actually that sounds like fun
---
Oh yeah have an ornament on.
---
His location changes every week. Infographic at niris.tv should help.
---
That would be kinda cool. Master working a ghost. Would unlock a extra perk or something.
---
Depends what you play on. On console I’d slap a counterbalance or target adjuster. Pc maybe a back up mag?
---
You need to modifier card from Xur. Nightfalls are in the vanguard menu all the way to the right.
---
Too soon man

I had to dismantle everything shaders,ships,sparrow for this one vehicle and it is worth it
---
I mean, it doesn't out dps the pve pinnacle. But it does do a good bit of damage.
---
You'll never reach the truth! (without doing the questline)
---
This is a bannable offence.
---
I have never seen someone make Gwisin Vest look as good as you have Guardian! 3 is the best.

Mythoclast was great, but prior to the one million nerfs to fusion rifles I'd have to say Pocket Infinity was one of the most feared charge up noises you could hear walking into a room.

[Here is a comprehensive guide to Escalation Protocol.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/992zbd/escalation_protocol_guide_all_the_info_in_one/)
---
As a Titan main I like to use mid tree Void with Ursa Furiosa, it’s not a bubble but the expanded shield helps protect everyone, plus they all get a slight buff to damage when shooting through it, any adds that get close get hit with a detonator charge which blows them up and any incoming damage absorbed causes my super to refill.
---
Has anyone else had issues with this?  Ever since the patch last week I am getting booted back to orbit after 400-500 dusklight shards from Bergussia.  Before I was able to last at least an entire day, now it's just like 5 hours.

Its ok in PvP, and how does a good PvE gun affect you at all? There are tons of good PvE primaries besides the Recluse
---
People actually go to the lower level of that jump?
---
I know im making it sound way easier then it is but i believe in you! Get those pinnacles!
---
If you want to use it for 5 levels then go ahead. I just think it would be a waste.
---
While your idea is great, I think the amount of detail you mentioned might be kinda hard to implement? Maybe possible.. I would be extremely happy with a difficulty setting with easiest being something like "child's play" and the hardest being something like "impossible" or something. Maybe go a step further and have dials to fine tune enemy numbers, enemy strength, boss life, etc etc. Changing the actually mechanics would be dope though

Just for fun I fired up D1 the other day. I’m really kind of shocked at how much pure invention went into that game. I don’t know how many years they were working on it before release but it just has so much. Then they released D2 and have made the fanbase cheer again and again just by *giving us back all the shit we had before.*  I mean in two years of D2 we’ve gotten one new enemy that’s a reskin of the Fallen. D1 invented the Fallen. Oh, and the Hive and the Vex. **And** it even had a reskin enemy in the Taken. 
---
So each time something is brought *back* to D2 I’m happy but also disappointed. If only we could keep all the old stuff AND get a ton of new stuff on a regular basis. Forsaken was the bomb. The Tangled Shore and the Dreaming City are both awesome new destinations. That’s the kind of drop this game needs every single year. Shadowkeep is looking good but it’s also a nostalgia play: *back* to the moon. They say they’ve doubled the area size but have they *invented* anything truly new for it? I hope so. The plot even sounds like rehash city: old enemies you thought were dead have come back as ghosts to haunt you.
---
Valor rank, not glory
---
The other was removed for being a camera recording if that’s what you’re referring to?
---
Yes, but you only get to level 30. Because after 30 you have to play forsaken. The item brings you to the level to play forsaken which is 30.
---
This is really true for every planet except nessus. Titan is a MUCH weaker version of the Moon and the EDZ is nice, but the cosmodrome is just.....better.
---
And the Annual Pass as well!
---
I did that. Played the vanilla for the first time earlier this year and then the expansions after the Solstice grind. Man, that game is SO different from D2. They did improved a lot of mechanics in D2, but there are things in D1 that I liked more.
---
Give me an infinite forest forge mode like halo where people can make levels. The. People can make crazy stuff and send it to gladd so he can leave poor raid bosses alone 😂
---
Mercifully is like the size of the main spawning area of the dreadnaught.. that’s the difference.. mercury sucks..
---
Are you running ordinance mods on your armor?

Ohh. Being a returning player isn’t easy. Thank you. Glad to see the community is still helpful.

---
All Destiny 2 purchases made on Battlenet will transfer to Steam.
---
Worth it.
---
I'm guessing a lot of people since it's only been around a short while. There's always been some weapon that people bitch about in gambit, way before truth.
---
It was Jupiter retards
---
Same.  I just came back too.  I was around the same stat line as you and it only took a few weeks to get to 50 and 700 light level.  I could have done it faster but there is so much to see and do now I had to explore a lot before focusing on the grind to 750.  Really happy I decided to come back and get all the latest dlc.
---
If they bring back another D1 location and it isn’t the cosmodrome+plaguelands I will be very disappointed. There’s just far too much potential there to pass up.
---
Still not as blinding as Omega Mechanos Crown with Mercury Vex Chrome
---
Yeah. That's the same Venus we go to in D1. Its not ,"destroyed destroyed", just taken over by he , crumbling buildings etc
---
I remember that, I didn't have the game yet, I went to house of a friend and he have the weapon, and I can Tell It was defiliti super op

“You Miss 100% of the Shots You Don’t Take. —Wayne Gretzky” —Michael Scott
---
I have basically started playing solo as of 2ish weeks ago. I have a buddy that I play with but the game has PLENTY to do solo. I am 120 hrs in and have yet to do a raid. just been grinding a lot of the y2 stuff and am starting to think about going after some y1 exotics.
---
It's almost like they all willingly walked into that grenade
---
I personally would say it is worth it if you have the time. There's a lot of great content and Bungie is definitely still remembering that there are those of us out there that solo queue most activities. Most activities now have matchmaking making solo play easier. And it is definitely not too late. If anything, now is the perfect time to play. Some very fun content in game and with Shadowkeep in October, the future looks bright.
---
Are factions gone? For example future war cult and dead orbit
---
Wasnt around for the 18 solstice. Sure as hell came back to the game for the 2019 one though.
---
Whisper isn’t meta in any way anymore, no one uses gls in gambit, sleeper and queensbreaker were meta in s4 and 5 but have gotten nerfed and left behind. So whats left lmgs and thats pretty much it an invader unless you use a snipe as well. If you’re talking about the pve side which is pretty much your whole comment then thats not comparable to pvp and you would need to compare it with nightfalls or menagerie or reckoning or forges. You can’t compare pve to pvp and then say crucible has no variety, especially not with gambit because its a much different game mode and is much more open as to what you can use and what is good.
---
O...kay?
---
Wait, I'm sorry, what do Titans bring to the table that hunters and warlocks can't? Only definitive thing is middle tree sentinal, which is necessary when flawlessing literally 1 activity. Every other bit of utility can be done as well or better with a warlock or Hunter. Not even mentioning the fact that the biggest utility a Titan can have is sit there and hold a shield, giving a damage buff that barely makes up for not participating in dps in a 6 man activity.
---
There arnt Hive on Venus, at least there wasn't in D1.
---
What roll u rocking my dude?
---
Hm...that seems really time consuming but I guess if you all agreed like while you were sleeping I guess that's cool.

I thought it said my wife died at first

i have a screenshot of that exact pose too.  i was going to tag it "makin my way downtown"

You will soon be approaching shores of a radiorian lake.
---
I wasnt being totally serious :p i know they werent there in D1 but really, the hive spread just about everywhere to be honest.
---
A whole new wooooooorld
---
Looks like Team Rocket's blasting off agaaaaaaiiinnnn!
---
Every time I invade the other team somehow become ninjas.
---
Indeed.
---
Ahh. Just the original comment was replying to the comment about nothing atall being changed since we were last on Venus. The Hives arrival there is actually a pretty major change.
---
You talk as if warlocks are useful and not just wanted for their ward of dawn.
---
Considering D2 is getting a reboot to its gear system and everyone is basically starting from square one I'd say now is a great time to start
---
Personally, I think all linear fusions should be moved to be special ammo weapons. With all of the fantastic legendary heavy weapons in the game, the linesr fusions have sunk to the bottom of the meta. Arbalest itself I think has found a good place in the meta where it is a viable option but not OP. I've always seen linear fusions as a utility not a dps weapon. Imagine if sleeper sim was an energy weapon. It would actually be *usable*.
---

There is that one adventure he is in charge of in tank area. Do the non-blow up everything option as a Titan and hes quite surprised, but thats not very Titan like.
---
I’m perfectly fine with where queen is at to be honest. Arbalest is meant to destroy shields and have you switch to something else to finish them off. I personally don’t use it as a killhouse weapon. Once I break a shield I’m done. I feel queen has slightly more damage than the arbalest does, but that just may be because I don’t use arbalest as a weapon to slay out. Id much rather have it in the heavy slot so that I can use other special ammo weapons and not have to sacrifice my special for it
---
What he said.
---
LOL
---
I’m at 750 and haven’t been Shielded too hard yet, taken phalanxes have cockblocked me a lot though
---
Especially after you punch through those ice Hive enemies on Mars!
---
I believe so
---
Now why are you campaigning for that outfit? 😂
---
Nobody:  
---
Not a single soul:  
---
Not even sonic:  
---
Hunter: I'm speed.
---
Everything i pay for becomes free, so should i wait a year to install shadow keep?
---
Arkborn Souls encounter on the m
---
Menagerie. Since the Souls are literally pure energy being contained by our actual bodies, if they’re held for too long the Guardian’s body fails and dies.
---
He said it was a few weeks ago
---
Sweet thanks Mr meseeks
---
Man, these ornaments are getting out of control
---
Fire team leader , I'm dummy thicc and the sound of my ass cheeks keep alerting emperor calus
---
Oh fair enough then
---
This belongs in r/Phalanxed
---
I preordered the game and I’ve never seen it this bad
---
Would be nice to see it come back with a perk that increased its damage when Backup Plan was active. Maybe kills with it renew Backup Plan’s timer.
---
Nerf super mods in pvp and we can all be happy
---
I think it ends when shadowkeep starts I might be totally wrong but it feels like the most reasonable way for it to end.
---
Bro.... we have so many shaders now.... not to mention ORNAMENTS...   
---
Imagine walking around the tower and seeing [THESE](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/thumbnails/4694-0-1479599196.png). Easily the most perfect RPG ever after that.
---
I'm very self-conscious about my knees
---
"He got all of that one."
---
Blade Barrage?
---
Your point...?
---
It's not bound to a chest.
---
It's a 5% drop chance for every opened chest.
---
So that means after 24 chests:
---
0.95^24 =~0.30
---
This means with a 95% chance to get NO 1K from a chest, you still end up with a roughly 30% chance of not getting one after 24 chests.
---
(I also think the guy you're taking about opened them before the drop chance was increased, so this happening was even more likely than actually getting one in 24 chests with a 2,5% chance:
---
0.975^24 &gt; 0.54)
---
I was thinking about trying this, but thinking about running vorgeth solo with arc weapons and not void to break wizards shields gives me ptsd from my last solo.
---
Chaos reach seems to have an internal timer after which the “suspension” from activating in wears off, but since the Super is still technically active, you can’t control it properly I.e. movement after falling.
---
The moon is pretty cold on the dark side
---
Throw on Transverse steps with the ornament to get some glow on your legs
---
Yeah I think it's a little broken lol although I did almost die when I popped it so there's that
---
I had this happen to me with the orb collecting in strikes.
---
You had me thinking you were gonna get the teamwipe + 7 kill triumph not gonna lie
---
But the nades tho
---
Ah okay , so no reason to hoard keys then
---
I don’t have TL, and the 21% is by far better than fixed odds, avalanche, and Hammerhead. (Obviously a personal opinion). Having a 204 round clip, and excessive rpm, with great dmg. Such a good weapon.
---
That modifier requires you to match damage to quickly break shields so it makes sense that a kinetic weapon, even Arbalest, wouldn't be effective.
---
That’s it, couldn’t remember the name
---
It's rather easy, far too easy to use. Click and the entire screen is obliterated. Even fists of havoc require some moving around and finding people to use, along with slight judgement.
---
One knife. Just that. You can easily shut down any super or the entire team.
---
Either it needs additional delay before firing or you take the same damage when using it.
---
reduce the time some supers (bottom striker) have, nerf OEM a little more maybe take away its overshield, and straight up disable super mods
---
Does the same cause of death appear in Wrath of the Machine?
---
21% is pretty good, but for the most part it sits in my vault unless i need a fast void LMG with a huge mag, I dunno i just find the curated hammerhead to be better, or thunderlord when I need arc. Dont get me wrong 21% is pretty great, but I mostly only use it in places where there are a ton of adds.
---
Check out the D2 discord!  Theres always people LFG there and they've got dedicated chat rooms for your fireteam!
---
He's already using an Chest Exotic, he would lose the chest glow without it
---
Nah we need that fallen Incineration Cannon 😤
---
Y'know, I wonder if Wish-Enders' broadhead could punch through both of those plates and destroy them.
---
I just thought about that.
---
5 is right out.
---
I can’t unsee this and it’s getting to me now
---
Yeah, that's a pretty backwards way of thinking about it.
---
Gotta love an unexpected Goblinslayer reference!
---
I was crouching on the ledge under Ikora.
---
Sounds like it's worth testing to me!
---
Yeah of course, if I need boss dmg I have swarm with spike and would never use an LMG though. My HH has FF and Genesis with fluted barrel and high cal. It’s okay, but the 21% does what I expect the LMG to do which is clear ads.
---
Since getting my dredgen title, I don't play Gambit for the win anymore just bounties and quests. If my team is winning I'll help against Invaders and killing ads for them.  Even invade if I feel in the mood.
---
If my team is being stupid I'll invade after completing a bounty and run around hiding from the enemy team
---
Quick play and iron banner are 6 v 6.
---
If only I could be so grossly incandescent
---
TO INFINITY AND BEYOND!
---
#OH
---
Oh sorry I read your posts wrong. But I do agree that sentry synths don't drip a lot for me either. The only times I seem to get a drop for sure is when I kill the invader.
---
We can die from anything it’s just that our ghosts keep bringing us back
---
I don’t realize how much I crutch my Erentil until I take it off and struggle in the next game. When I use other weapons like shotguns and snipers I don’t have them out all the time, but when I use Erentil my finger is always on the swap button so I can backup plan to my heart’s content.
---
then don’t complain xd
---
Yes and I dont think I will ever use them
---
Bro the same thing happened to me yesterday. I got killed by a sniper and it showed the shotgun symbol and just said "shotgun"
---
