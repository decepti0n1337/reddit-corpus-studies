Shoot the gun
---
---
---
35 attempts of what?
---
Same problem. Why can't they ever get this stuff right the first time?
---
Dude wut, ace was stupid easy compared to TLW, and then they made it slightly easier.
---
Check benedict , he sells it sometimes
---
100 percent accurate
---
Holy shit that's broken as fuck. But also awesome. Enjoy that shit, Titans
---
Honestly, Mayhem is a decent option for the kill % part, but it is SOOOOOOO good for the medals step.
---
You can‚Äôt turn off stars in space
---
PS4 player? Curious as I found that part stupid easy after understanding you had to shoot its gun, and I‚Äôm on PC.
---
Blinding Grenades. Genesis. Threat detector. 
---
I'm not so good at PVP but, Shards of Galanor + Blade Barrage was an extremely effective combo in Mayhem
---
This
---
Anyone know how much more dmg does ads do than hip fire?
---
Bungie. Bring big maps back. It‚Äôll force the player to change up their play style every so often. It‚Äôll make it so shotguns and other short range weapons aren‚Äôt always the meta. You may even get to do LESS weapon balancing because the weapons are now more situational and the player can be put into different situations depending on the map. 
---
Aiming is hard for you?
---
We thought gwinsin was bad...
---

---
Ha
---
I can read spongebob memes all day. 
---
I'm pretty good at PvP, well was haven't played in months. But I was mainly pve, I hated joining parties and try harding PvP.. I just played to mess around mostly. PvP to me was a place I could kill time between raids nothing more than that. If I wanted to play PvP style games Id be playing CoD or halo. Atleast that is my opinion
---
Shhh don‚Äôt let it blow up we want titans to stay on top
---
I'm like the most mediocre pvp and I had it done easily
---
I dont mind if someone takes motes that I generated, but if I'm clearly running directly at them dont slide in front of me to take them. When I was finishing malfeasance I had a guy on my team following me around the entire match doing that, then the next day I got on and the exact same guy was on my team doing it again! Following me around and diving in front of me to take them, the entire match.
---
F
---
Link?
---
Chap is honestly very forgiving. 5% per kill, -1% to all not complon death. Long as you focus one spec at a time it‚Äôs pretty easy (especially for Mayhem week).
---
I love the wishender its so fun, thanks üòä good luck on getting the egg!
---
Spider got yo covered.
---
Letting you "waste" your special ammo and then run in front of you for the mote like it's money you dropped.
---
Spectral blades was invisible and had more damage resistance. That‚Äôs definitely harder to kill IMO.
---
Are you thinking of the well of radiance?
---
How do you get the radiance on it? I've had radiant frames but they come out without it
---
I couldn't agree more. 
---
I think it's more that the requirement of slaying guardians without dying or else your progress gets set back is what's pissing everyone off. It forces the player to reach a certain skill level(mind you, it's not that high) but you cant learn how to do that overnight.  The game is doing a dark souls, "git gud or you won't get it"
---
&gt;Oh and also the reason I brought any of that up, if you actually go back and read the conversation, was due to you stating all my arguments are based on opinions
---
Really?  I said that?  Where?  LOL....talk about putting words in someones mouth.
---
Now for the best part.  This post, the entire topic, was about the elitism of the warframe player base.  What do you do?  Come along and give us the perfect example...lol
---
&gt;such as destiny being simplified to cater to whiny players, or the fact that the destiny community has been criticized and mocked in articles and videos by actual game journalists and the developers themselves
---
Bravo....you are such a sterling example of "one of the most helpful and friendly gaming communities around" lol....
---
LOL this is gold

 You sir are amazing!

When you hover over an engram in the Eververse store, you can right click on it to preview. Not sure what button this is on consoles. 
---
If you want to get a specific cosmetic by farming, [take a look at these nightfall exclusive items](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/9dizev/nightfall_specific_loot_infographic_version_2_ive/). Each one is a rare drop from that specific nightfall, with the chance of getting it increasing with your score up to 200k. There's no telling when a particular nightfall becomes available, though. 
---
Majority of my time went to my hunter, he's maxed and glorious. My titan is chillin at 45 cause I'm lazy 
---
You gonna cash in those engrams or?
---
Ah okay that's fun spent 50 hours trying to get to 650 still haven't gotten there now imma have to do 700 wtf
---
I know how it feels. I climbed from 33 to 98 in 5 games, then fell down to 70 in 4. I don't know where "you only need a . 5 kdr"  and "kills add 2%, deaths subtract 1%" but it is completely wrong because I got a kill after hitting 98 and it didn't work.
---
"xd" yes, the classic dodge from an actual point in an argument
---
A lot of people seem to be having this issue. Are you able to go to the Gofannon forge? 
---
Story of it?
---
actually a better analogy would be this:
---
&gt; it's like buying a DVD you want, and being forced to also buy 3 other  DVDs you don't care about, 5 CDs of bands you never heard of, and an  Autobiography about the singer in the band you never heard of in one of  the CDs. you're paying the price of the bundle ($40 for example) because  they don't release the DVD you want as a standalone. 
---
Bygones is a beast but im loving my tigerspite, tbf tho the rolls are pretty neat: outlaw and killclip 
---
Oh, I read the comic, just didn't realize the shader was a reference
---
I could try it out and see which I like better. I use risk runner as my secondary. 
---
I was wondering when these posts would start popping up
---
No it doesn‚Äôt it‚Äôs just fine
---
Maybe 
---
But
---
Yeah idk
---
It‚Äôd be cool
---
But at the same time people would find some way to make op and then it‚Äôd be nerfed into the ground 
---
It‚Äôs like 12 hours to complete 40 matches if not more if they‚Äôre constantly 3 round matches üò™ so glad I‚Äôm close to the finish line.
---
Probably but still it needs a downside to wearing it
---
Ahhh for me risk runner didnt kill all that fast so I was like meh tiger spite is a hit more ste wa dy so head as hots are easier
---
Well you don‚Äôt have your super and that can be a big downside
---
Made me realize ...
---
Nah i still hate people 
---
Nothings changed
---
Didn't that just get a buff as well?
---
True, but I was going along with the lore, maybe just no idle super regen, you have to get kills to get your super
---
No light? No ghost? Add:
---
‚ÄúIf you die in combat you can‚Äôt be revived for the duration of the match.‚Äù
---
That‚Äôd actually be pretty cool
---
this sounds insanely fun, thank you for sharing this :O
---
Roast of the day goes too...
---
Yep nothing I hate more pisses me off more when I need 1 more for a blocker and someone slides and steals it 
---
Risk Runner works for me in PvE. I just pop my Titan arc grenade and charge myself up. 
---
If I revert to tigerspite, I'm thinking of going back to Coldheart since it got buffed recently. Haven't tried Prometheus lens nor the void one. 
---
Most of the time I just sit in the back in gambit and let my team grab the motes 
---
When he was cutting his wrists open from losing games?
---
Personally I had a lot of fun with the subtle calamity, but I also prefer snipers in games so thats a possible reason. If youre on the running and gunning part Id suggest the sweet business cause that got a massive buff I think 
---
as a hunter.. beautiful. simply beautiful.
---
It's worth it brother. Stay strong!
---
I got it a couple weeks ago and still haven't played Gambit since. 
---
It actually helps though
---
Cayde would have been proud.
---
Thank you. I do my best...
---
Ah. A Protector, I see?
---
Thank you 
---
its how I feel about the pve exotics I don't have. I don't raid so no weapons there, or catalyst
---
I'm on PS4. I'm just a split second off from getting a clean kill on him. Now that I've taken a break and calmed down. I should be able to nip it in the bud.
---
Hey it's me when I invade.
---
my boy!
---
The only non-soloable activites are the raids. 
---
Ah, good ol‚Äô Cargo Bay 3. 
---
Get new gun. What then? 
---
Can I order one?
---
lol I like how it looks like a ghost steering wheel. 
---
Strikes are a pve where you fight through to get to the final boss and then kill them to get vangard tokens which you give to xavalla to get engrams
---
I would like to know too
---
Check r/fireteams there should be a recruitment post over there
---
it is amazing
---
Eh I wiped a team using this super sounds OP to me especially when you‚Äôre using OEM 
---
I second this.  A print would be fantastic. 
---
Wasn‚Äôt this quest time consuming? Just the one step took me over 12 hours averaging a 1.0 k/d. 
---
That‚Äôs BEAUTIFUL Guardian!! Well done!
---
Yeah when I was testing it I noticed that. Thanks for the feedback, friend, I‚Äôll definitely give the gun another go when I get off work.
---
I‚Äôll Venmo you $5 if you‚Äôre right 
---
Idk man I think it's always funny when control basically evolves into free for all killing. It's a shit fest but a fun one. 
---
Hes looking at whatever is on the right like "really bitch"
---
Darksyde#11327 
---
Feel free to add me 
---
I remember this episode! ahahahaha
---
It‚Äôs not fun when you‚Äôre getting mercy ruled every other game. 
---
U mispelled Tlaloc
---
Just go to titan. Plus the lost sector in that has the entrance where the ritual is has the wanted enemy for the other part of the last word quest.  
---
Where is my no land beyond wtf
---
Fabian strategy is like the breaknecks little brother 
---
from slamming my head into the wall after being a dreg's pube away from fabled and dropping back 50 points
---
I went with six shooter gg, a lot more fun than barrage imo for that part
---
for sure, i sent you one.
---
Warlock: You are dumb, Titan! DUMB!
---
Bungo says no
---
High Value Target
---
Kill, or be Killed
---
The fuck did he meam by this
---
Where did you get it at that price I'm curious now. 
---
WHERE THE HELL DID YOU GET THAT GUN?!
---
It was on clearance at a GameStop
---
Nice I'm going tomorrow to get it. I see one here close to me. 
---
Well that explains a lot
---
If you were actually good at it yourself youd have figured out that it wasnt that I couldnt but rather that I didnt want to. 
---
I'm reporting this post, I'm like 90% sure this was an actual murder. 
---
I'm not actually sure.  Got so annoyed that I haven't played it since haha. 
---
I felt that today I never felt so terrified
---
You know, you got a point there
---
You need to do it with the person who gave you the refer-a-friend or you gave.  I got it from a mate, think we did a few of the quest steps and he has since bailed on D2   :(
---
You‚Äôre a rock star 
---
I was just frustrating cause it felt like me and the other guy did all the work and the guy with nothing was afking the whole time
---
I think the complaining is mostly from getting held back because of getting killed a lot. no one likes losing progress, and going from 80% down to 30 is a huge kick to the balls.
---
 and this is repeated over and over again, it cannot be completed with a drop. 
---
You mean to tell me you didn‚Äôt think the Drifter was sketchy? Ofcourse he‚Äôs probably a bad guy, or at the very least an Anti-Hero type 
---
That‚Äôs fair enough, I think it‚Äôs fine in pve to be honest 
---
I guess the only thing to do is suck it up, atleast you got a solid score and in my experience is aslong you play consistent and do top motes and try to kill the invader for your team you will win most games even with randoms, good luck 
---
It‚Äôs funny that they buff the supers ability to chain kills but not it‚Äôs survivability or duration. Having all masterworked armour doesn‚Äôt do a thing so that doesn‚Äôt help in the slightest. GG is my fav subclass but my lord does it get abused. 
---
I like how they said sorry, but anytime you see my group like this no need to worry. It‚Äôs a four stack of suck and mainly just there for fun.
---
I usually get most motes and gaurdian kills when I'm playing with randoms but I've been on a losing streak for almost five days now the worst part is being stuck at legend
---
Or you know. One eyed crutch.
---
It‚Äôs never worth an exotic slot in PvE. Anything less than endgame it‚Äôs fine to mess around with if you like it, but you‚Äôre gimping your damage substantially. 
---
Same here bud, I can never seem to get any god roll primary weapons. I have, however, had 3 god roll Crooked Fangs. I think all my luck has gone towards those dupes. Sad times.
---
Ah, a fellow Juggernaut Striker. We proud few.
---
Ah 
---
Use wideneck 
---
The phrases got old so quick 
---
Gonna get downvoted for being negative, but honesty is the best policy, IMO. You did a good job of remembering what it looks like, but this is a really poor drawing. You need to practice **a lot** more. You‚Äôll get there one day.
---
Same
---
Bump
---
You have to wait after you've broken the crystal, after the quest update, jump down ^^
---
How not to use the Golden Gun lol. 
---
You can only get Seed of Light on full curse week.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/alimnu/drifters_commentary_when_you_get_tlw/effezrr/ has a clip of his reaction at the end of the questline. 
---
Ah fair enough. I just assumed because they made the regular quest available everyday that maybe they changed up catalyst progression. Either way, thank you Guardian!
---
Aren‚Äôt they ending the Dreaming City curse cycle next week?
---
Yoo is this how you get that triumph done??
---
The strats to wait for the enemy to make a mistake, die, and get rezzed, repeating until they mess up where you assumedly punch them 
---
Nobody sad that. I heard end of March or something. 
---
ah yes, this map was so fun. good times
---
Huh. I must have read the wrong thing... apologies for the confusion.
---
So lemme see that thorahhhlastword yeah last word 
---
The only problem I see is it takes away to feeling of having a social zone that is 100% non pve and pvp, but I come to the tower to chill and I feel I wouldn‚Äôt wanna miss out every time I saw this event was about to start and I‚Äôd end up doing it, it sounds really cool tho
---
The best I can gather is that we weren't questing to get the last word.
---
In fact we were working towards making a weapon for the drifter (most likely thorn). 
---
In pursuing this, we gathered more attention from shin onto ourselves and he decided to gift us the last word for multiple reasons.
---
1. So we wouldn't die to the proto-thorn as suppressed areas are lore wise true death? Or atleast we could revive later but doing so would allow the proto-thorn to remain in the hands of the hive.
---
2. To try guide us from the path, or present another option to merely going after weapons of darkness
---
3. Honestly the most probably one is to fuck over with and screw with the drifter
---
My first two thoughts would be corrupted Vram on the GPU or a memory leak with the GPU and the game. Does this happen with any other game?
---
It's a bug, it will still count, I did it with super and other weapons, the killing blow was drang. 
---
It seems that just the frames that you get from ada as a quest reward are bugged. The very first one of each forge. Got the bow frame and couldn‚Äôt do it. Deleted it and bought pulse rifle frame. Worked. Hope that helps you.
---
I NEED THIS IN MY LIFE!! 
---
"GF messages me"  Shaxx "yess guardian!"
---
"Having dinner with GF" Shax - "I cant believe what im seeing"

"Having Sex With GF, nearing end" Shaxx - "SEVENTH COLUMN!!!"
---
It seems that just the frames that you get from ada as a quest reward are bugged. Got the bow frame and couldn‚Äôt do it. Deleted it and bought pulse rifle frame. Worked.
---
Only 90 minutes? That's me running ST with 2 other guys lol, nice.
---
When I'm in a forge and people are just killing but not throwing motes, I stop throwing motes.
---
There's story and lore significance for The Drifter giving you the quest.
---
Knife flip, but with TLW
---
not to mention the fact that its lore and story are based on PVP, too.
---
How do you get the ship? @-@
---
No
---
Too much info. Noone is interested who, where, and why did that awesome meme. Just give it to us.
---
In the hands of Devrim
---
I got for ¬£10 without the bag :P
---
oh yeah... i did lol
---
I was lucky enough to have a void shotgun (two to the morgue) and void heavy (corrective measure).
---
It took 8 hours, but I didn't sleep until it was done.
---
Good times. 
---
You make some good points
---
You I love and hate this strike, I hate it because the boss goes immune a million times, but then I love it for those huge ad waves that you can really mow down. 
---
Whoop! Congrats man! 
---
ur literally wrong
---
Rumble isn't good for people who are bad at pvp, I'm one of them.
---
From where you started if you do a 180 you can see a small gap where you can get out of the map unless they patched that have fun exploring
---
I found the pvp parts of the LW quest to be pretty straightforward (as someone who hates pvp) using Mayhem + Shards/Blade Barrage (apologies for being a scrub but oh well), but I agree that I‚Äôd like a decent, tough exotic pve quest. We had Wishender but that‚Äôs not exactly a game changing exotic. Then we had Thunderlord, which absolutely is a game changing exotic but the quest was ridiculously easy! I also remember with shudders the sword quests from D1 but they were a lengthy, tough grind with rewards at the end that were fantastic. More of this please Bungo. 
---
I ended up doing mayhem using a roaming super (dawnblade), still took a few houses but did it. 
---
It's not? I'm pretty sure Whisper singe resets when Xur's in town
---
I was like you when I was running Quickplay, then just loaded into Mayhem &amp; just enjoyed the experience. It‚Äôs a lot more fun to just run around popping supers like crazy instead of having to rely on any fixed strategy or loadout. 
---
Its a PVP gun. I personally don't want Bungie to 'dumb down' this or any future quest for the less able player. I WANT MORE! and if I can't do it I dont deserve the reward, my bad! 
---
I want more TLW quest, Whisper, Burden, Luna etc etc. With every Tom Dick and Harry able to reach max light anyway they please I want stuff that puts me ahead in other ways. Seals, guns you can waltz around the tower with that only top tier players have, Great!
---
there are invisible platforms to jump over there? TIL
---
It's too powerful. Getting a kill isn't hard, and once you do you basically have double health, hit harder, and can wall hack...
---
Personally I think they should remove over shield and wall hack. It's still very good but not as cheese
---
Dude I felt like I was losing a friend there. The Drifter is my favorite character from Destiny along with Cayde and Ikora (screw you Zavala). I hope we come to terms when I get my hands on Thorn.
---
Yep, still limited to one char per week.
---
BOONNNEEE?!
---
very true, but at the same time these limitations are still impacting the console community, im not stating that the hardware issues are all bungles fault, sure you can better optimise areas to improve a higher frame rate etc but what I am mainly referring to is the QOL difference in game mechanics between the pc and console community.
---
If anything Good old bungo could make recoil control more forgiving on console to closer match the likeliness of pc with its superior mouse utility and change up aim assist to compensate etc.
---
Wait so Drifter is a bad guy? I kinda like him
---
MY FEELINGS!!!! 
---
eyyy ty  ty , only one slice but ill make sure to share :)
---
in cqc TLW might be good but when it comes to medium range its just not usefull. Trust is in my opinion way more reliable when it comes to short/medium distance. Also if you can hit headshots it can melt just because the recoils is really really small. Depending on the map i use a Shotgun or a Sniper together with it.
---
Another downside to me is, is the fact that it is a exitic. This means i cant have a Queenbreaker or Thunderlord in my powerslot. 
---
Keep it. If you already have a kindled with kill clip/rampage then shard it for the shader. If not, 100% keep it, best hand cannon in the game.
---
*Alright alright alright, let‚Äôs see what we‚Äôve got.*  
---
*Drifter memes, on the horizon!*
---
Play more PvP and not only for quests. My first shooter was Battlefield 3 and i startet with a 0.33kd. I played the game for around 300h and at the end my overall kd was 1.0. (the kd in the sigle matches at the end at around 1.5) 
---
What i want to say, in every fu**ing shooter you can get better if you want and sweat for your life.
---
Bottle it up, then bust it!
---
Poor casuals crying again. The war never changes.
---
Would be better in d2 tbh. You'd actually have to lose something to use the main perk, not just wait till death.
---
I trust Variks more then I trust Drifter. *THAT'S* saying something...
---
I fix it, I have a Alienware, gtx 1080 icore9 and was having the same issue with my external monitor 144hz , with the laptop screen was just fine. 
---
Window mode: window fullscreen
---
Resolution : 1920 x 1440 (increasing it to 2k was causing the drop) 
---
PC: configure your nvidea card to process gsync in windowed as well
---
Cheers! 
---
Lookin good!
---
A ward of dawn is insane in gambit (boss phase), strikes (bosses or smaller areas where enemies spawn - basically everything where you can play stationary), raids (again, everywhere stationary) .
---
I feel ya.  I don't have Acrius because I don't raid (no clan/friends).  I don't have Whisper because I don't have friends who play and I can't solo the mission.  Ditto for Malfeasance.
---
Sometimes you just gotta accept that some things are out of reach due to what parts of the game you enjoy and those you won't/can't play.
---
Clearly, Bungie wants to train its players to just leave any Crucible matches that aren't going your way so you don't lose too much progress. I don't see how that could possibly be a problem.
---
my post? that makes no sense
---
That‚Äôs ping mostly. Some people just have potatoes for WiFi. I have run into people like that many a time. 
---
I had that as my alarm for exactly one day before I changed it to a fallen ship arrival. Shaxx screaming certainly wakes you up but the sudden adrenal burst is horrifyingly powerful. 
---
Pro-tip: you may think "Sylok the defiled" will be a fun alarm sound. It is not. 
---
They are needed for:
---
* infusing gear that is not a duplicate
---
* raising the master work level beyond level 3 (there are 10)
---
"Muthafucka you got one more time to call me a punk or the next thing I'll be bankin' is yo' ass off the side of the plaza wall."

- My Guardian.
---
How I got it (Hunter)
---
Good if you Have Lemon Arch, Better if you have Gwinsin Vest.
---
I paired the bow with The Supremacy because my roll was decent. Pair it with what you want. I basically stayed back behind my team and pinged groups with poison(Assists Count!) When I got my spectral blades I waited for the enemy team to line up in a path so that they would be near, Spectral Blades will most likely be the best roaming super since you can make it last for a long time.
---
Just play passive-agressive in crucible. You need the Kills and Assists but you do not want to die.
---
I just got Thunderlord yesterday from a lost sector and I can never find heavy ammo now
---
The lore was super cool to read along as you did the quest
---
as long as you make sure to shoulder charge them...they shouldn't notice.
---
Your wife plays destiny? #relationshipgoals!
---
Oh yea I remember how I got infective now. I camped my ass off.
---
Redwall crossover idk how I feel about this
---
I've wanted golden gun to be this good for so long. I just about cleared a whole wave of ep without stopping. It's so fun to decimate dozens of ads.
---
use the arc charge.
---
true, though bolt caster was from a quest meaning it's guaranteed to get whereas black talon is one of 5 y2 exotics i still dont have
---
If the thrall uses sparrows, dregs wil 100% win since their accuracy goes to 200%.
---
I think the 'lose progress on death' is the only bad part, not the PVP in itself. If it were just kills even the biggest noob would eventually get it.
---
I'm just okayish and it was relatively easy in 2-3 games, but I can imagine it being really frustrating when you get stomped
---
What subclass is that? 
---
it has armor but not much, it cant be killed in 2 melee hits like outside your super
---
Thank you!
---
An Exotic AR back in the Taken King DLC that, when enemies were close to you, would increase its stability, handling, and rate of fire. Every kill also returned around 7 rounds to the magazine. People didn‚Äôt like it, but I personally enjoyed it.
---
Also, fun fact. The Ace of Spades was actually once a Hunter exclusive exotic, much like how the Fabian Strategy was a Titan Exclusive. The Warlocks got an Omolon Scout Rifle that increased its stats, including rate of fire, when their super was full.
---
First line of thrall will get wiped but once they reach the dregs they're unstoppable. 
---
I‚Äôm gonna start using that strategy.
---
Starting the Crucible part of AOS.  I am *terrible* at PvP.  Nnnnnot really expecting to get this done in anything under 25 games.
---
Last game I got 2 kills, neither were HS.  Felt like I was getting aimbotted.
---
It gave me mine.You might have had yours dismantled.
---
That happened to me quite a bit also.
---
I have taken numerous screenshots in this game it is just such a beautiful game.
---
The whole point of d2 was to give us new shit. To be a new game. Not a polished version of d1 with extra guns. Cause thats all I'm seeing anymore
---
His primeval slayer was at 10. I‚Äôm interested to see how much damage at x2 or x1
---
Seriously tho, smugglers word with full auto and rampage? It‚Äôs fucking insanity and does more then some of my main rifles 
---
Except you don‚Äôt pay for just the weapons.  Nice false narrative.  
---
Aww man, well hopefully something will actually change like drifter dying or shin dying
---
And your monitor screen cracks üòÇ
---
Speaking from personal experience but try to like not get mad wgyen you lose motes for the dark motes step cause it'll be annoying but raging over that shit gonna make it a worse experience if you know what I'm saying.
---
Good job, dude! Go into mayhem for medals.
---
Yeah nothing from the forge is new...
---
Anonymous autumn with threat detector and kill clip is one of my faves to use 
---
That is incorrect
---
Good job but it wasn‚Äôt that painstakingly hard of a quest 
---
That doesn‚Äôt really explain how there are other energy primaries, like sunshot, GL, and RR
---
I mean all ya gotta do is get above a .5 KD to progress 
---
damn i remember doing the thorn quest for me and my brother. shit costed me all my nerves 
---
Wait really? 
---
Not sure, I haven't had this issue. But just making sure when you restarted you did the restart from your guide menu or power cycled it by unplugging the power and plugging back in? Just because the button on the front only puts mine to sleep and doesn't turn it off.
---
Also, you might try power cycling your router, and if you connect via wifi go to your network settings on your xbox and disconnect and reconnect to it. While you're in your network settings check to make sure your NAT is OPEN.

You might have already gone through these steps, but I just thought I would mention them in case you missed one and it's something simple. Hopefully it's not a big issue, and best of luck man I hope you get it worked out soon!
---
True but the with the Drifter it would be a suprise really. He's told us he's murdered his "partners" before. 
---
There should be no aim assist IF it has hit nothing but a wall.  Chaining off someone I get, but letting them get free kills just by throwing it towards red on the radar is dumb.  Aim or be amazing at pool.
---
But he doesn't trust Drifter, at all. Nor should he. 
---
I guess I‚Äôll have to see today. Hopefully it does
---
The real rifleman died when he tried to escape the prison of elders, some big vandal took his place here
---
I still need one solar run left to finish the blueprint + catalyst completion so hopefully lmao
---
It‚Äôs almost as if it‚Äôs an entirely new game.
---
Or use us to find out more about the weapons of sorrow. Bet he'd be REALLY into whisper. 
---
I hoped on and played some D1 crucible last week.  I had completely forgotten about the big open maps with vehicles.  It was such a breath of fresh air from the ubiquitousness of CQC in D2.
---
Now the question is what the hell was Last Word doing with a hive dude
---
I think the dude killed his ghost because he was driven mad for pursuing the darkness as Shin says. Everyone who dabbles with the darkness and hive stuff starts to literally hunger for light and destruction (I think Toland said that in the Bad Juju description). And the guy was in a heated argument with his ghost before stabbing it. Think it was a thing of "the heat of the moment".
---
I never noticed Gwen Steffani and Gavin Rosdale in background before today. Hmmph
---
lol me too, If it‚Äôs solar I can 2 at once
---
But ‚Äúthe loyal‚Äù is part of his name 
---
wow, did we just stumble upon a rare group of sane and actually nice redditors?
---
BBBBOOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Just to be sure how was it ‚Äúnerfed to the ground?‚Äù Most supers one shot in pvp, shouldn‚Äôt this be the same? 
---
Unless they nerfed the damage and decreased the super time 
---
No I had Rasmussen and it gave me the other.
---
Ever get swarmed by thrall where you can't jump and avoid them? Thrall all the way
---
Hunter is the most played class. I guarantee most of the people that play hunter can‚Äôt aim very well.
---
I haven‚Äôt tried unplugging the Xbox and the router! I‚Äôll give it a shot, thanks :) 
---
Random drop from completing  a powerful weapon frame I believe . 
---
Congratulations, i love the perfect balance here gj 
---
R/madlads 
---
Lemme say this to all those hardworking sherpas:
---
Thank you really.
---
I got the Izanagi's Burden last night due to the patience of a player that was so good, you'd think he had three hands on the controller. He helped me get through the Shattered Throne and made it look simple for a casual like me. 
---
I just grabbed randoms off the app for the Pyramidion 640 and the end boss which were no big deal at all thankfully. 
---
What the fuck
---
fuck banking on 15
---
invade on 15 then bank that shit.
---
if it was possible invade on 15 and bank in their bank
---
play like a little bitch. it feels crappy, but it gets the job done.
---
Some of it's best uses I've seen were on this subreddit. The one about "no one can solve the puzzle" killed me. 
---
Thanks!
---
It‚Äôs a PvP gun you should be doing pvp things shut the fuck up 
---
Oh. Thanks for the spoiler :/
---
I'm a only pve player because well any pvp game is terrible plus Destiny pvp us just like halo pvp and halo pvp is so dumb I just think pvp is a waste of time mist of destiny is pve
---
I see people leaving motes on the field all the time, so I just started going and getting them because I KNOW I'm going to bank them, whereas there's about a 50% chance that you are going to run around with them like a moron and get killed holding 14.
---
You're welcome 
---
That's a fair point. And if they plan on transitioning to D3 sooner rather than later that's probably a good move. Personally, I'd prefer them not make a new game for a while and just keep adding to D2. 
---
Lol, underwear? I GO COMMANDO GUARDIAN!! Neither Hanes or fruit of the loom can‚Äôt roll with enhanced perks dismantled them all. 
---
How many enhancement cores and legendary Shards you think I got from dismantling my panties?
---
Good for him, not the best counter argument, though
---
Yes it‚Äôs that quest. Thorn isn‚Äôt here yet. 
---
can you please fuck my wife
---
Thorn isnt in the game, it's coming during the next season. The drifters quest, The Draw, does end with you getting the last word yes
---
I think masterwork orbs and the small orbs are the same thing 
---
THAT'S A LOTTA NUTS!
---
Cake day brethren!
---
No, you'll get the shader again. Ive yet to get a curated Forge weapon, at over 70 weapons forged.
---
That wouldn‚Äôt help any of the people in this comment section because using that exotic perk actually requires kills. 
---
That everyone ages differently and ur point is mute?
---
Dregs would prob kill themselves after listening to 1000 thrall screeching
---
Why would a PvE player beg for the last word to be in D2? 
---
oh should i post the hunters ones or warlock ones too?
---
Well they're two different types of supers so I don't like saying one is better than the other. Sure you can BB the boss but it's better suited for add clearing. I'll use GG over BB for bosses.
---
I love it. It allows you to jump into crowds of enemies (as a titan should) and destroy things forever, while at the same time providing you with a less-than-brainless way to get that sustain. It's like having a minigame in your fights. Super fun.
---
Secondly is the ‚Äúunderwear draw‚Äù in any connected to the last word draw!? I said I go commando but if there are some secret exotic Whitey tighties share the info my guardian friend. 
---
Boy, I wish this information was clearer. I just found out the powerful pulse rifle frame was Blast Furnace, and not the Black Armory Hawksaw or whatever, like I thought all along. Ugh... Ok, got it.
---
Ohhh, I didn't see that. Right on, thanks.
---
Acting like women playing videogames is some special weird thing worth nothing is very much not the way to achieve that goal, just saying.

I need to make a PSA on Reddit about queuing gambit with two primary weapons in your weapon slots. I swear those fuckers just enjoy loosing matches. 
---
oh shit it's the meme police
---
That's so good to know. I guess I missed that part. Thanks!
---
Gratz!!
---
Well every 4th event on Titan is this one (it's always walker on sirens watch, walker on the rig, walker on sirens watch, witches on the rig and so on). You are able to see on the map when the event spawns u know... Other than that... True
---
Wait wft some one explain why there is d1 plantents?
---
Yeah you can‚Äôt it sucks
---
The most painful part of the malfeasance questline for me is winning gambit matches because I can‚Äôt carry three other people. I‚Äôm getting 10 kills a match and usually wiping the enemy team when I invade and my team is doing fuckall while I‚Äôm gone. I have to focus on killing the enemy team because if I don‚Äôt they‚Äôre going to invade and kill the three idiots on my team who are constantly running around with 15 motes. 
---
Each character has individual progress so you have to play through everything with each character
---
No, because they are separate characters. There are some certain challenges/bounties later in the game that may be available across the characters on your account, but the campaigns/story missions are character specific.
---
TIMES UP, LET'S DO THIS
---
I cried at 99% then died six times in a row.
---
I will finally have stompEE5!! Been wanting and waiting for them since playing. 
---
You are under arrest!
---
Mhm exactly. Idk what it is. When I was first learning shit I always asked questions man. But idk everyone is different I guess. 
---
Go to Mayhem, the people who have Last Words don't matter because noone shoots their guns and it's almost always a guaranteed postive KD aslong as there aren't like 5 barrages on the other team. Took me 4 games of Mayhem with about 20-30% gain each game. 
---
Petition to change all EP final bosses to Willy or similar names. SAY I
---
Is the huckleberry any good for pvp or pve?
---
I hope this is sarcasm because this only works in PvE. Unless the enemy team is grouped up in PvP and at that point any super but ward and well could instawipe them. But yeah keep complaining. You hunters won‚Äôt be happy until titans are removed from the game. 
---
It was on uhh PlayStation 
---
it's meh
---
I guess it comes from the people that will insta kick someone who asks a question, but it still annoys me when you make it clear.
---
I have a guy in my clan who plays only pvp. He pulls great efficiency every game, but has a hard time focusing and remembering mechanics in raids, to the point that he just kills us every time. You think he‚Äôs the only one who doesn‚Äôt raid?
---
I got Sanguine Alchemy
---
end my life
---
GIMME MY GEOMAG 
---
Ah ok
---
has to be powerful
---
This sub is comming in 2nd as of late
---
I upvoted you for you speak the truth about using the OP stuff. That‚Äôs how it be. Gotta play the meta if you‚Äôre trying to get this quest step and know you suck at crucible. 
---
Don't wanna be that guy, but I don't see how it's impressive. The whole kit got a big buff with this patch. Playing gambit with some clan mates you get 1 stack and a melting point you can take out one bar of his health with a nighthawk crit. This would be the same effect with any ranged super if you get 10 stacks.
---
Never said wiping upsets me but if I ask the lobby of people I pull in for whatever activity and everyone agrees that they know what they are doing. Then I expect some level of competence. I don‚Äôt get angry or upset when I Sherpa. Everyone has been a noobie before and I‚Äôm more than happy to help. I‚Äôve spent 8 hours in a raid trying to help people. Was probably the most fun I‚Äôve had. 
---
But when I Sherpa and someone doesn‚Äôt know. I will normally explain it and show them the role they have or will be having and some things to look out for. Then ask them to try and show me and if they have questions. 9/10 it works with the people I‚Äôve helped. 
---
Progress is progress. Some ppl clear raids in 20-30 mins. Others take hours. 
---
Is there any game that lets you start a new save starting where the other save left off? Not sure why people are surprised by this. 
---
Thank you, this is genius!
---
With rampage spec you never drop rampage. It is a higher bonus than kill clip so I think it's still superior. Plus you get it up before a reload. 
---
Ohh yea! I found it in my inventory. It was broken indeed, I am now working on the questline at the moment on the one were you fill it up to 100%. Thank you alot! 
---
The way I personally understand it is, as Rezzyl Azzir he was a titan. But when he cast off that identity he also cast off his very class, he became more (or less depending on your view) than a mere guardian. He saw the futility of the guardians struggle and so he cast it off to be something more, something more sinister. So even if it isn‚Äôt exactly correct, I think of Rezzyl Azzir the guardian as a titan. And I think of Dredgen Yor as something else entirely, a shadow walker, a dark warrior, a evil counterpart to guardians. It could be that Dredgen Yor was on the way to becoming whatever the beings that live in the pyramid ships are. But I personally think he wasn‚Äôt a titan in the end because he cast off his identity to become Dredgen Yor.
---
My problem is the 3-5 stacks roaming QP with Last Word and OEM. Like they‚Äôre only there to keep the primarily PVE players from getting it. It‚Äôs disgusting and should be filtered in matchmaking.
---
Thanks chief.
---
It really sucks how bad TLW is on console, I wish bungie would readjust and reduce recoil and bloom for you guys
---
I can relate
---
yeah PVE clan's cant be exceptional players. Being exception players doesn't translate to PVP at all.
---
Funny part is that it isn‚Äôt a glitch. Lol
---
Don't forget to consider the difficulty of each bounty.  Obviously turning in the easiest or most frequently seen first. 
---
How? 
---
They make the shattered throne a lot easier.
---
Huge TF2 fanboy here... YES YES YES!
---
I mean the whole quest line he‚Äôs been talking about the weapons of sorrow
---
Holy shit I didn't know! Fucking awesome!
---
The d2 video has significantly more recoil... You're in an outdoor section and the recoil takes it almost to the top of the wall you're shooting, in the d1 video, you're in a hallway and the recoil doesnt even take it close to the height of the d2 video. In d1 it was very easy to ads and hit someone across the map 3 times in the head, in d2 (on console) it tough to even hit someone if they're 30 meters or more away, let alone track someone. Bubdie straight up said there is disparity between the feel of ads on console from d1 to d2 and they're gonna look at it

I used to just clear adds but doing the plates is actually pretty fun
---
Am i the only one thinking it's the thrall because they will rush ?
---
I miss the Leviathan PVP map.  Where did It go?
---
Dregs have guns, but they're so wimpy they probably can't kill the thrall. When thrall get in groups and start screeching even Guardians die. 
---
They said after listening to THE COMMUNITY they are looking into it. They haven't confirmed anything. And which video are you looking at? Perfect balance with soft ballistics? Most real TLW users never used that. 
---
It's so... Beautiful! I'm missing this and 3 bones for the Cursebreaker title.
---
"This is an O.G. call"
---
ask yourself - "did i throw as many grenades as i possibly could have?"
---
I just found a Tractor Cannon last week! I‚Äôll try that out. I‚Äôll give the Agrona PR4 a try as well. Thanks!
---
It should change every Friday when Xur‚Äôs here. If it hasn‚Äôt changed I‚Äôll be a bit pissed lol
---
Izanami burde questline was worse imo and I'm primarily a PVE player myself
---
I don't use wifi, speed is good, but I definitely have some issues with bnet games
---
The main issue is that there are 4 stacks literally trying to keep people away from the weapon. I got to 50% in a couple games, then dropped down to 20 in one.
---
Same I‚Äôll be pissed if it doesn‚Äôt change
---
I hope this is sarcasm because these ideas are all bad
---
Well thank ya!
---
It has not this week, sorry to piss you off uh.
---
I'll run huckleberry with catalyst, as a devour warlock with winter's guile and have so much fun.  Running up to a full health shielded minotaur and just wrecking it with a slap and getting full health back is too good.

The enemy team must be sooooo salty, and if it didnt take so long to get 10 stacks of slayer, they would be battering your team with hackusations
---
Ummm, I have had so many discussions in the past where i have just proved Jotun is just way OP and needs nerf. I explained how dodging it by stepping to the side is difficult when ur busy trying to achieve optimal ttk with ur luna/bygones. I also explained how the only weapon in the game that should be able to OHK anyone at long range should be a sniper headshot , and that takes **actual skill** to pull off, compared to firing up a toaster and abusing the verticality. Lets get real. Only potatoes will fire it horizontally. If u ever played in comp, jotun is abused so much, ppl know how to charge it up, jump and fire, and its OHK no matter where it hits me. I have been teamwiped by a titan running OEM + Skating + Jotun. So dont tell me it can be dodged by (....stepping to the side).
---
Also, there are reasons why its banned in tournaments and scuffs, they clearly write "Ban: Jotun, OEM , Telesto", and they are professionals running an event with actual sponsors. They know better than both of us, and if they are banning it, pretty clear reason why. Just because u have not fought against ppl who actually know how to abuse the verticality of the game alongside Jotun , is certainly not my problem.
---
Also, its not a "tiny percent". You are wrong Sir. They said the same thing a 15 yrs ago about cs 1.6, and look where its at now. I dont need ur pessimistic attitude towards making this an esports, when Overwatch is doing so well already.
---
PS: I am not gonna have another Jotun/OEM discussion with you, since whenever I write a really long argument against it (check my history), ppl just leave and dont respond coz they g0t 0wn3d.
---
I'm trying to figure out when Golden Gun became the Golden Sniper??  Getting picked off from across the map is ridiculous
---
When your friend who has one leg doesn‚Äôt run as fast as you... see how funny that is? :/
---
I mean, I have my hands full keeping my devour and riskrunner buffs up, do you think I have timr to throw some balls at a forge with an inconsistent hitbox?
---
Wow really didn't know
---
NOW THAT'S A LOTTA DAMAGE!
---
There's one for completing the Ada-1 questline (you also need the emblem for the collections) and also one for completing Niobe Labs. You also need that emblem for collections. 
---
I'm a hunter main bro. It's still broken
---
You‚Äôre so close! You can do it :)
---
Back in d1 I wasn't a sherpa I was the carry for VOG for templar I could hold relic stand on plates and damage. Now I gotta learn all the spawns and mechanics for these new raids
---
I did it fam. I fuckin did it. I just want to cry. 
---
You got this!! It's all downhill (just grindy from there, nothing excessive)
---
Slightly? Theres a huge hole in both my table _and_ the satisfaction of my build now.
---
Really I like the last word on console I got used to it pretty quickly and I love it 
---
I have three words
---
ONE
---
EYED
---
MASK
---
DO YOU LIKE NOT HAVING TO CHANGE YOUR PLAYSTYLE TO BE REWARDED?
---
Titans: nods head furiously
---
DO YOU LIKE BEING ABLE TO BODY-SHOT KILL WITH SNIPERS?
---
Titans: NODS HEAD EVEN HARDER
---
DO YOU LIKE BEING HEALED INSTANTLY FOR KILLING SOMEONE?
---
Titans: NODS HEADS SO FAST THEY LITERALLY FALL OFF
---
WELL DO I HAVE AN EXOTICS FOR YOU! BE PREPARED TO BE REWARDED FOR CHANGING LITTLE TO NOTHING ABOUT YOUR PLAYSTYLE, UPON KILLING SOMEONE WHO SHOOTS YOU, YOU GET INSTANT FULL HEALTH AND AN OVERSHIELD AND EXTRA DAMAGE! 
---
FORGET HAVING TO REGEN HEALTH FOR THE NEXT GUNFIGHT YOU CAN JUST KILL SOMEONE AND BE READY, AND BECAUSE OF THE EXTRA OVERSHIELD AND DAMAGE YOUR SURE TO WIN YOUR NEXT GUNFIGHT AND THAT ONLY PROLONGS YOUR ASCENSION TO GODHOOD
---
HAVE A SUPER? BE PREPARED TO NOT DIE BECAUSE YOU CAN GAIN THESE BUFFS IN YOUR SUPER TOO! WHATS THAT? LOW ON HEALTH AND YOUR ABOUT TO DIE? NOT ANYMORE THROW A HAMMER AT THAT GUY YOU MARKED HALF AN HOUR AGO AND YOU HAVE FULL HEALTH! 
---
In regards to you saying hunters are the fastest
---
BOOM BABY, HEY TITANS YOU REMEMBER TITAN SKATING IN D1?!
---
Titans: nod heads 
---
WELL IT JUST GOT EVEN BETTER IN D2 BEHOLD TITAN SKATING 2.0 FLY ACROSS THE MAP AT MACH 10 SPEEDS GOTTA PLANT A BOMB IN COUNT DOWN? NO PROBLEM IM ALREADY THERE AND THE BOMBS PLANTED!
---
I rest my case
---
I‚Äôm about 75%PvE 25% PvP and it‚Äôs not that don‚Äôt listen or buy into all the toxic noise, have fun with it.
---
I may be able to give you some insight but not a definitive answer.
---
The armor looks to be from top to bottom
---
- Celestial nighthawk
---
- Tangled web grips
---
- Prodigal vest
---
- Reverie dawn strides
---
I am unable to identify the cloak and the shader
---
appears to be suros modular shine
---
Eh, Killing Blue guys gives you more of a time boost, so if someone wants to focus on killing them, I'm happy to focus more on throwing.
---
Callum was in no way a real friend of the Drifter. Callum was one of the real Shadows of Yor, and the Drifter very openly admits to be the one who reported Callum's location to Shin.
---
‚Äò‚ÄòTwas only a meme
---
This better be sarcasm 
---
I assume you are getting Not Forgotten?
---
Yes, you are able to get to 5500 comp Points and then get the kills, did the same with my Luna.
---
The 6 forges is the best, you can farm weapons at the same time.
---
I honestly prefer it to breakneck for pve due to it's ability to kill as many ads as needed without reloading.
---
What inconsistent hitbox ? It was meant to be like that if you hit the wrong side of the charge.
---
What do you get for completing them?
---
If I remember correctly I got it finally in Age of Triumph.
---
First Curse though... that shit still eludes me
---
Shuro Chi with new raiders hurts, it's always that damn puzzle...
---
Last step was fun af my dude what are you on
---
nobody needs to be boosted through anything in this game.
---
You monster üôÄ
---
That's not how that meme works.
---
I don't mean like they're totally useless but they get outclassed, hard.
---
Part of the challenge is escaping so it is still a restricted zone. So asking the devs to "fix" it because you can't complete it is tangential to the problem of you not being able to avoid the rocks. 
---
Yea, listen to u/spidertanrbaid. It my be difficult, but it's doable. Honestly my suggestion would be to try an LFG or check r/DestinySherpa for someone to run through it with you. It's a lot easier if you have 2-3 people at the boss fight, and even easier if someone has Whisper or something.
---
Unironically it makes you a better player. My clan mates who hate pvp are way better at it because being forced to play with even the slightest regard for your own life makes all the difference.
---
Mayhem is the easiest way to do it IMO, but biting the bullet and doing it proper is extremely beneficial in the long run
---
It wasn't invective, I was able to get invective without doing that step
---
me in lfg discords
---
Wtf happened? 
---
Credits go to @kyber3000 on Instagram. Go check out her page and give her a follow for more infographics like this 
---
This is hitting the nail on the head. The healing, overshield, and damage buff are symptoms of the true issue with OEM. When you are Marked for Vengeance, your best option to fight that titan is to run away. To immediately disengage. The Truesight alone pitches the fight in favor of the Titan, and because of the force multiplier nature of the helmet, if the Titan gets his mark kill in a 1v2, he gets two kills. 
---
Cammycakes uploaded a video that highlights this point. In a legend rank survival game, against an OEM titan who used Fist of Havok, the best option for fighting him when you get marked is suicide by cliff.
---
Which is the tragedy of OEM. Exotics should change the way the wearer plays. For example:
---
Lucky Pants incentivizes you to play quickdraw games on your handcannon. Learning to set up a swap into your handcannon right as you move to engage someone. Or use a Bow or sniper in a 'tap and swap' fighting style.
---
 
---
Hallowfire heart is a great example of this. By actively NOT using your super, you instead gain massive bonuses to regen speed on one of the best grenades, and perhaps THE best Melee for PvE content. It also has room for getting very good at judging when you can safely use your super and either regain it via orbs or not needing the bonuses.
---
Celestial Nighthawk allows for massive burst damage at the cost of holding your super for a boss, when the subclass is based around shortening the time between supers (orb generation on super, practice makes perfect). You effectively trade any benefit your subclass gives for a single moment of glory.
---
The Last Word forces you to rely on hip fire and bring the weapon into shorter engagement ranges then one might be used to for a handcannon, increasing risk with the reward being high damage, with the shallow clip being the trade off.
---
Whisper wants set up time, excludes other abilities such as Rally Barricade and lunafaction, but provide potentially higher overall damage in exchange for lower actual DPS. But only if you can land your precision hits.
---
Good exotics modify the wearers own play style in a way they enjoy or the content demands. You pick an exotic because it changes the game in a way thats exciting or required.
---
OEM modifies an opponents playstyle in a way that is frustrating, annoying, high risk, and counterintuitive. Imagine if it instead read 'get three kills in rapid succession'. Or 'Kill two enemies without reloading'. Or even 'kill an enemy with a precision hit while your shields are down'
---
So many ways to adjust the trigger condition to make it less terrible to play against, while changing the buff into a reward for skilled or risky play.
---
So then what is this thread for? Are you saying HCs in general are OP or that LW is? 
---
For all we can tell from the pic, its 4 LWs vs 2-4 HCs. On the left, one titan has a shotgun (might have a HC in 2nd slot) and another titan is holding some 1h weapon (probably a HC). The other 2 players both have Ace. So chances are high that this image is a 4 HC vs 4 HC fight. If that's the case, no wonder a 4 HC team won...
---
I truly have no idea
---
I hope this is the corrupted strike bc there a secret triumph where you ‚ÄúOnly hit Sedia with charged orbs‚Äù but it seems to be bugged. 
---
True, but we can‚Äôt have all 3 of our weapons as void damage like in D1. 
---
Also the fucking 5:2 ratio was such immense hell nothing can make it better. Although Spectral Blades is some shit now that I think about it
---
The end with the tree phase draw and shoot the gun out of the hand. My network issues made it impossible. 
---
I hope this is the corrupted strike bc there a secret triumph where you ‚ÄúOnly hit Sedia with charged orbs‚Äù but it seems to be bugged.
---
Anger and caffeine
---
At least you deposited before you had too many motes lol
---
GFG  
---
What did you OEM have on it for perks?
---
Yes. Hahah. Along with the draw animations bugging out.
---
Better safe than sorry
---
The thrall will smother your light!!
---
How is it broken? Pls explain?
---
Skull fort is a god roll
---
How do you get wayfarer again
---
Idk why im being lazy to look it up
---
Even if it's 400, power level stops scaling once you're +50. So being 450 or 650 wouldn't make a difference.
---
Ah dude don't you know it
---
Blade Barrage‚Äôs returns via Shards is far more consistent, although arguably worse for boss damage (it fits the role of versatile add clear/damage super now) but I‚Äôm sorry, Trinity Ghoul is absolute trash. If you *must* must run a bow, Le Monarque is better; if you simply want a chaining AoE clear then anything with Dragonfly will stomp on Trinity Ghoul *and* allow you to use a heavy weapon for the exotic slot. 
---
If you‚Äôre looking for the ultimate in add clear as well as retaining respectable boss damage, consider running Orpheus Tether, pulse rifle + shotgun and either Anarchy or Prospector. The lingering damage over time synergizes with the persistence of tether and continues to kill things as they enter the tether. For boss damage, you can drop a tether on the boss, dump a few rounds of heavy on the guy to get the DoT rolling and then switch to a shotgun. 
---
Another one to play with is Blade Barrage + Young Ahamkara‚Äôs Spine + Gambler‚Äôs Dodge + Tripmine + Paragon mods. Ability damage resets tripmine, throwing knife kills decrease throwing knife cooldown, gambler‚Äôs dodge resets throwing knives, throwing knife burn resets dodge and dodge has an innate 10s cooldown due to Paragon mods, if you screw something up. You can roll around throwing knives and mines almost indefinitely.

This week‚Äôs Skullfort is as close to a God Roll as you could hope for. Hands on is the best synergistic perk you can get on it. Running code of The Missile with Hands On Skullfort in Gambit can get you your super by the second wave of ads. The recharge rate is insane, and your melee never runs out if you use it right. 
---
Congrats Guardian!!! I‚Äôll be going for flawless soon myself, next week most likely! Only have 1 raid challenge left, 2 of the sparrow chests to open, and 2 more rare bounties that‚Äôll hopefully drop soon! Haha 
---
I wasn't whining. I said that most of the complaining is over the loss of progress when you get killed. there was no whining, if you'll observe, only your ignorant ass jumping to conclusions.
---
My main is hunter and havent touched warlock yet (titan is my 2nd chara and still not maxed out), so cant tell that i know that feeling :/
---
Level and power level mean nothing in Crucible. The levels are disabled, so it should be equalized (relatively).
---
As you level up, you'll get better gear. 
---
Dregs have guns lmao 
---
I‚Äôm just sitting here looking back on when Bungie nerfed Sunsinger in D1, then everyone kept complaining, so they nerfed it again into oblivion.
---
I'm not too sure it's not an alien, it's the vex creamy center as the drifter put it.  Though it concerns me how obsessed brother Vance is with the stuff... 
---
\*shudder\*
---
But not a BB.
---
Maybe I'm misunderstanding what you're saying here, you're making it sound like the witch envoys respawn, they don't.
---
After you kill the envoys, it's simply time that increases the slayer buff, that's it.

IMO Skull looks amazing as-is, but it's definitely worthy of an ornament by now. Wonder how that could be approached - maybe something Taken-looking?
---
Lunafaction's [already got an ornament](https://imgur.com/a/ZI03PDV), I think it's okay but I understand why people wouldn't like it (I don't own it cause Eververse hasn't given it to me yet so forgive the bad colors, it probably looks better with different shaders). I'd rather do ones that don't have ornaments quite yet tho.
---
I feel that, fam.
---
Would be great if Bungie would put matchmaking for raids and clans into the game like a real MMOFPS
---
By the way you can go to Mars too, right
---
Not even joking, this was the best part for me. Just assing about with other guardians waiting for the event. Then, when it pops, just outright demolishing the event in about 20 seconds. I love it when vets get together. üòÄ
---
Should be, there one by the EP, just i never saw it spawn.
---
That‚Äôs how you win gambit and get malfeasance a couple kites at a time small blockers are better then big. 
---
I gave up doing the quest on my warlock and went to work leveling my titan and hunter
---
All 3 do just fine in pve, solo or with a team. It really depends on your playstyle. Titans have good survivability with their shields, but aren‚Äôt as mobile. Warlocks can have high damage output, and their rifts can be a safeguard against dying. Their jump can be tricky until you‚Äôre used to it. Hunters are the most mobile and can‚Äôt take as much damage, but can get in and out of situations very quickly. All 3 do have at least some support abilities, with hunters imo being the least overt support class (but a skilled hunter can make up for that in how they play). 
---
Your class choice really depends on what you like though. If you‚Äôre going to be soloing, it doesn‚Äôt really matter what you pick, and if you‚Äôre going to mainly play with others, your choice will probably depend more on what the group needs.
---
Solo player here as well. It just boggles my mind that there is a coop game that has no matchmaking for the main endgame activity. But thats ok! Anthem is a few weeks away and the days of blocked gameplay by absence on matchmaking are over!!! 
---
Because Gungi never turns off blackout thralls
---
Michaels crafts store
---
I could honestly care less about the perks.  Getting 6 duplicate exotics in a row is not a good way of keeping people interested. 
---
Thanks Odin! 
---
If you've got Melting Point, every single raid encounter becomes a joke. MP + 2 chaos reaches melts primeval with slayer on one stack, your dope mobility ability (shoulder charge/whatever the other subclasses call it) isn't put on cooldown unless you hit someone, you have the only ability in the game that cancels supers, you have more move speed than a 10-mobility hunter with Stomp-335, your melee is the only one in the game that can 1-shot above 2 resilience.
---
And all that is without taking into account a single class exotic. Couple that with the fact that you have as many OP class exotics as hunters and warlocks *combined*...
---
Yeah, I'm a warlock main, but I swapped to titan for a while and even without any top-tier exotics, found it way too easy to pop off. I just slapped on as much durability as I could and ran/skated at my enemies till they died.
---
I don‚Äôt doubt that.  It sucks massive balls.
---
Well done
---
People these days dont know how good they actually have it honestly.
---
‚ÄúDID YOU COUNT THEM??‚Äù
---
I get up to 30, I drop down to 0. One death -5, one kill streak +1. Makes no sense.
---
LFG give it a try 
---
Well Pve wise yeah they're not the best. But have you ever played competitive crucible ? It's literally only titans dude, they're the best pvp class in the game simply because they have OEM. Granted, even I don't use oem, I just use synthoceps for pvp. 
---
with ward of dawn, you can 1v4 an entire team. Titan is incredibly good if you want to ruin people's day in comp
---
It's a good idea to have all 3 damage types, since the shields are really hard to break. 
---
I have heard the Warmind quest exotic Polaris Lance works pretty well. For a heavy weapon, have a super high damage boss killer. I use Sleeper Simulant, another Warmind quest exotic. 
---
Wow, wish I was that good
---
Thank you though.
---
A mix of midnight talons and dawning hope. The helmet is calus's treasured 
---
The tale still isn‚Äôt over though, I have no doubts that there‚Äôs gonna be a new lore book accompanying the thorn in jokers wild.
---
*Good ass damage*
---
Game: here's a blue. GG
---
"had exotic drop from a source that drops exotics" should be the title
---
I'm you're huckleberry 
---
I use tether and Tractor Cannon. Do I get a sarcophagus?
---
According to guardian.gg you're correct. Great eye.
---
I thought the forsaken dlc came with Osiris and warmind too
---
inwas wondering how i would listen to an hour of lore...listen while im shooting stuff is a great idea!
---
Someone was getting owned and now the cheeks are sore. Lololol
---
See... these are the details I'm looking for thanks! I appreciate the info.
---
Oh shit I never knew
---
We should make a megathread asking Bungie for matchmaking on raids, seriously.
---
It's so fun Nova Bombing after being teleported up that high.  I'll be honest and say I've missed a number of times, but nailing a direct hit is very satisfying.
---
Ayyyyyyyyyy
---
O that‚Äôs hot 
---
Thanks for the infoüëçüèº
---
I have played 12 hours of gambit in thr last 2 days and it spawned once for me 
---
Maybe. But generally with sunsinger it was till you die (which in comp is something you're striving not to do). Well's normally used before that point for some form of zone control (or for big DPS).
---
I was quoting the game, kek.
---
I found Polaris lance very helpful for the final room, as it returns ammo for every crit and it does quite some damage
---
r/destinydadjokes
---
Me too. Pretty good (if i do say so myself)
---
Hahaha, now you know! Always buy the items he sells if you don't have them yet. The engram is guaranteed to give you a year 1 exotic you don't have yet, including what Xur is selling. 
---
This is a genuine question and I don't mean to be rude, but how poorly did you do in PvP for you to stay at 0%? The quest gives you 2% for kill/assist and -1% for dying, meaning you only need a 0.5 KDA. Mind telling me your gamer ID (and what system) so I can take a look at your matches?
---
Also some advice: play mayhem. You don't need any skill to stay at around a 1KD in that game type. If you're on PS4 I can help ya if you like.
---
I did. They need cooler bonds, and the legs are hardly seen with most robes. Sometimes the robe gets cut off at the waist and it looks cooler that way.
---
I \*always\* make sure to let anybody I am doing it with that I am a complete and utter noob before even setting out. They may not want to do it with someone they have to teach, and thats fine, as long as they know beforehand I dont waste their time. luckily I am in a clan with a lot of people willing to teach (although the 3 biggest members that I did just about all my raiding with left recently and quit destiny so thats a bummer) so i tend to have a group of people to help me out in the first place
---
It makes it feel a lot worse, which is a pity since I was a big fan of the triple knife and not so much of the super. The new outlaw GG is amazing though, you can just blow up everything in your screen and then deal similar damage to the boss as with BB during that same super.
---
PvE only. Crimson, Riskrunner, and Breakneck do the same thing but a lot better, though. If you don't have either of those it's still worth having, especially with Devour Voidwalker.
---
That's how I feel about seeing the Hammerhead Machine gun, wish they would've added 1 or 2 normal Machine guns to earn in world drops for us people without access to the forge. (Like a Vanguard one and a Crucible one, maybe one from the Gunsmith.)  
---
Yes I know there's Avalanche, but that was only during an event, and Thunderlord takes the exotic slot which makes it rather limiting to use.
---
Pick it up from Shaxx. 
---
But EVERY TIME I DO IT MAKES ME LAUGH
---
Sauce?
---
with prime slayer x10 you could of sneezed on it and it would of died 
---
It was available with Hands On like a few weeks after Forsaken. It definitely is great. 
---
True, but we already know how it ends... I would love some more personal entries about the hope Dredgen baited his victims with. Besides that one entry with the 3 or 4 victims, we haven‚Äôt gotten an account of how he‚Äôs slaughtered people. 
---
Yeah when I saw that I got even more excited!
---
No way, that would be a disaster 
---
There is matchmaking. It‚Äôs called guided games. No one uses it because there is no way control what type of player you get.
---
That‚Äôs the roll I have. I don‚Äôt know if the weapon ammo perks are different, but hot damn is Hands On good. 
---
Thank you.
---
Last word is great, dont get me wrong, but it's not super op, best gun in the game, 2 tap all guardians, amazing gun. Ace is still better in most scenarios.
---
There are lot of ways to make it safe for raid experienced players.
---
Very much worth picking up the Skullfort if you don't already have one with Hands-On (extra super energy from melee kills).
---
You jumped into the air and dropped like a graceful little butterfly when he could get a clear sight on you. That death is on you.
---
How is it done? Just got mine the other day and I'd love to get it masterworked
---
You need to make a couple of heroic quest on Mercury, following the story line, there's a quest on EDZ for repair Sagira and after that you will have access to normal activities
---
Thank you, how? I got to him quite often but how do i pick it up?
---
Hunters are not the worst PvP classes by far. Just because you play hunter and are bad at it doesn't mean they are the worst. Hunters have, by far, the best neutral game having high mobility, the quickest verticality (jump) and the only class that has quick evasion skills (roll) meaning you can stay alive in any situation you're near cover.
---
There's a reason why theres as many hunters in PvP as there are warlocks and titans combined, and most of the top PvP players main hunter.
---
r/nocontext 
---
Depends on situation and perks. Whichever one has Dynamo or Bomber is going to be better. Fr0st-ee5 are good for anything other than Blade Barrage because of the ability cooldown, recommended for Nightfalls and raids. In general though, the mobility of St0mp-ee5 is slightly more useful given Hunter has an awful jump and no strafing abilities whatsoever, recommended for strikes, patrolling planets, and ALWAYS in Crucible.
