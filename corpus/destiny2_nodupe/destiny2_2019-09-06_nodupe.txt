Our clan is not on Discord, but we do have several active members that are 40+ (myself and my husband included).  Those of us that are active regularly are  east coast, and some of us play on ps4 and PC.  We are actively recruiting players that want to play together and enjoy the game.

This was me when Xur had Geomags a while ago. I wasn‚Äôt thinking and bought the fated engram first... and got Geomags. Felt like an idiot
---
No one
---
Mate I'm not a Bungie fan boy **I'm just enjoying games.**
---
I don't even use raid armor, I use my other armor to make myself look good. The whole point of Armor 2.0 is to allow for customizations, which is why all currently obtainable Y1 armor will be relevant - which we didn't have for a year.
---
The Eververse Armor is now Ornaments, and the "easy new stuff" has some really good looking armor, everyones excited for the Phenotype Plasticity set.
---
Lord I hope you try call me out for being bad at the game or something though...
---
I would lay my life on the line for ghost ghost.
---
Everyone fights! No one quits!
---
Or like minded humans who enjoy each other's company...?
---
Check you privilege
---
Can't wait until Uldren takes his spot as Hunter Vanguard
---
Good to know you speak for everyone. 
---
Do you want me to call you bad so you can gloat or something?
---
This conversation has nothing to do with anyone being bad or good at the game, nice try though.
---
If you are legendary, you are at the highest rank.  You have to win or turn in bounties at that point to increase your score for reset.  You do not go from legendary to mythic.

I'm going to give you one If u dont chill
---
Uldren is going to be just as good as Cayde if not better imo
---
I'm also 100% positive he wanted to put a boot up uldrens backside too. But, as you said, he has a responsibility to protect those in the tower and the city.
---
okay okay, Saint 15 then.

Why you do this to me

I'm good

---
The things comp will do to a person
---
No, it is not possible. Due to the game moving off of battle net and on to steam, it is now no longer in the battle net store and has not yet been added to the steam store. It will be on the steam store on October 1.
---
I wiped an entire team in the first round when I was the LGS.  We lost the next four...  My team suuuuuuuuuucked.  I had faith and stuck it out though.
---
You can not purchase it right now. As of October 1st you can on steam, preorder is the route I am going.
---
I'm excited for the change. Now I can run whatever super I want for raids. Plus, cheese runs and single damage phase boss encounters will be few and far in between (especially the week of a new raid).
---
(Laughs in Getaway Artist)
---
~~No. You must do the same helmet bounty 3x in order to get a notorious copy of that helmet. If you have the tier 1 helmet bounty this week, that means next week you will have tier 2, and on the 17th, when Moments of Triumph ends, you will be able to get tier 3.~~
---
[Ignore all that, the "quest progress" patch note was, I am guessing, talking about this](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/47688)? No idea, really, but it no longer works the way I described above in this comment.
---
 That's what I assumed was going on but I couldn't confirm it anywhere. Thanks for the help.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt want that shopping cart. 3 of the wheels are bullet magnets
---
I was speaking for myself lol
---
Thx
---
exactly! and i always feel terrible if i‚Äôm the one to get disconnected because, aside from losing points, it means that whoever i got matched with is going to be down a person. the way comp points work is really my only problem with it. like i get that losing progress is an incentive to improve, but there are some things that are just out of the player‚Äôs control.
---
Doing it to Nokris
---
It only drops from the tier 3 Oryx fight. I have gotten 2 and one totally sucked
---
late fits cayde, F
---
Does it drop from gambit prime and I cant do tier 3 for some reason
---
Yeah but Well is getting a nerf to it's damage output as well. Definitely season of the Titan as Warlocks don't have the best level of buff and also can't apply weakening.

Weird flex but ok.

Who needs the light when you have a fine feathered friend by your side.

Are you talking about the buff with Empowered? Because I didn‚Äôt know that. RIP Warlocks.

Not a fan of the Hunter set. Like, at all. Hard skip from me
---
I need it for a quest and I've rage quit twice now. I'm on console and can't beg them not to

Too spooky for me

Mfw hunters' main survivability is mobility yet warlocks do that better and get a rift.

They had it coming!

can't believe the raid gear has been available for over a year

That what i like to hear. Go fourth and punch things into extinction

That's a great combo yeah!

They didn't eat their wheaties.

Good point. I guess there isn‚Äôt a choice. My bad. Lol.

You could just buy one on new egg or Amazon if you're not wanting to go out, otherwise most stores sell them like Target or best buy. But you'll want to make sure it's a USB connection, not a standard ssd. (standard as in meant to connect with SATA type of cables.

You got any more tall tales about how you are beasting in comp??? ü§£üòÇü§£üòÇ. If you are going to lie about how good you are on a post you made, maybe delete your gamer tag. Hell, you even lied about what console you were on.

Yeah, I‚Äôm usually beaten up by a single knight like that and we wipe

Ghost Ghost is one thing, but I NEED my broomstick back.

That would be amazing dude!!!

Looks like a vex gate on the right. Missed those from D1. Good to see them come back!
---
A handful of the crucible maps are being cycled out for a adjustments.
---
holy FUCK
---
I understand your point, however it's not about whether I can handicap myself. It's about the motivation behind becoming a better player. If doing a raid required a lot of skill (kind of like unbroken does) then I would try to improve my gameplay to meet that level of skill. But since anyone and their mom can complete a raid, there's no reason for me to try improve. No reason or reward for being the better player. I guess you could say that the reward would be just for myself. Saying that I could do what most people didn't. But I'd rather have something more meaningful. If the raid get harder, it raises the skill cap required to attain the raid armor. Which to me, is a benchmark to show my improvement in the game. Because right now it's not worth improving my skill so that I can say I'm the better player when there's not much to prove it beyond some stats. The raid will become a marker for improvement, which to me would be a more meaningful game experience. But that's just my opinion and I can see how this alienates some of the community.
---
dew it
---
Then it tells me some bullshit about leaving a Gambit match early after I have to force close and restart the game.
---
I honestly don‚Äôt mind l. I think the Armor looks nice
---
Did you figure it out? I can‚Äôt figure out what to do either
---
Division 2 also has an adjustable fov now too it makes a huge difference
---
I actually laughed.
---
Or drink there milk
---
Ugh fuck these stupid ass memes
---
This is why destiny can NEVER be tailored towards casual players; people people RUIN the game, and i mean DESTROY it for other by doing afk farming and other exploits
---
Hunters? You mean things that get in the way of my KNEEEEEEEEEEEEES!!???
---
It‚Äôs random
---
Holy shit!!! This is so cute.... this was in destiny 1??
---
Yup! It was one of the best ghost shells by far
---
I did a lot of EP, can't do nightfalls cuz I'm constantly on the border of 699-700
---
here's the thing, sometimes the smart thing to do is still the bitch thing to do. sure, zavala may have made the "right" choice, but it was still a bitch move
---
I can‚Äôt tell if you‚Äôre mad at me.. I agree with half of what you‚Äôre saying. There‚Äôs people who are very good that just beat you and carry on, there‚Äôs assholes that win a gun fight and bag because their egos are fragile. That‚Äôs 0% what I implied should happen. We all agree OEM shouldn‚Äôt really be in the game in its state. Anybody who doesn‚Äôt agree, uses it as a crutch because they‚Äôre a subpar player. Bungie takes forever to reasonably balance things. I haven‚Äôt even touched the load out because I would just feel scummy to do it.... ps they are a lot easier to deal with on a hippity hoppity hunter. Sometimes I have to run 1-2 punch just to deal with them when I see 2 or more on the other team.... pps, don‚Äôt try BB it works on them only like half the time. Shotgun melees, GG, and wardcliff are super effective.. and if you learn how to play arcstrider, force push annihilates that and every other super on the ground
---
Ana ain't lookin' too hot
---
I doughnut know about that my dude, as a warlock main I'm more often than not the last guardian standing.
---
He is speaking on his wrist comms
---
ok Boomer
---
strikers talk with grenades. 
---
seriously though, i hate playing other subclasses because i just love tossing grenades everywhere
---
Yare yare.
---
Yeah. But I love playing middle tree sentinel. I can turn everything into a grenade when it dies
---
Vex messing up with time like always
---
They should just have an event where everyone swaps roles. Zavala is crucible. Shaxx is strikes. Drifter is running eververse. Tess is commentating Gambit etc.
---
[My advice on how to prepare.](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/cw669h/what_is_changing_or_disappearing_with_the_start/)
---
Wholesome Greaves
---
You don‚Äôt have a choice
---
But like how many people would care as much?
---
Well damn, I think the style fits the hunter more than titan actually... maybe because he cloak hides the Hershey kiss on top of it.
---
let me know! this is very impressive.
---
Spawns were an absolute mess it needs a rework
---
Games "rng" sucks. Got the shotgun on my first complete clear. Haven't received another drop since and it's up around 36 clears now.
---
But I got nothing right now, he probably tells you to do 2 strikes in order to unlock nightfall and I completed 9
---
As a 100% warlock main, I‚Äôm happy about this change.
---
Are you wanting a grenade launcher specifically?
---
Can you explain why?
---
They could have removed every destiny 2 map and replaced it with rusted lands and I‚Äôd be happy
---
3rd grader would probably make something that looked better...
---
Thanks bungo
---
It feels like it increases sprint speed
---
I love you
---
I really wanted the Cat Ghost, but sadly RNG found me unworthy.
---
Or machine gun. I prefer machine gun but grenade launcher is meta. So either work, just no rocket launchers. Practically useless in PvE
---
Might just have the wrong rolls on it if it feels weak
---
This is getting down into the legalese, but I sing an automated script to do things for you while you are not there is called botting and botting is explicitly against the TOS. A macro would be more accurately described as something you use during play in order to automate certain functions or to hit things perfectly which you wouldn‚Äôt have been able to otherwise - ie Titan skating. 
---
It‚Äôs pedantic since the term macro gets used to describe any kind of simple bot though.
---
I mean, linear compensator or counter mass? Then i have spike grenade, auto loading holster and ambitious assassin
---
Yea ofcourse.
---
Smh my head you forgot toasters have to be plugged into the wall to work
---
the missing link... a weapon to surpass the metal gear
---
That looks really cool though
---
Looks like hunter vex leg is back on the menu bois...well kinda atleast lol
---
Anyone else notice the Hunter has one Vex foot? Reminds me of D1.
---
I‚Äôm also perplexed why this isn‚Äôt the raid gear instead of the re-skinned Eververse set with glows on them.
---
I‚Äôm amused I got a reply, why so serious üòÇ
---
Thats me looking at what the other team are using in crucible.
---
Imagine if the titan vanguard was the same and the hunter vanguard. Zavala could just be kneed into the next dimension
---
Dear warlocks,
---
Welcome to having stupid looking armor sets
---
Sincerely, Titans
---
At least Spare Rations requires skill to use
---
Okay the Hellas basin is a mars strike/nightfall so you won‚Äôt be able to do that as it is a dlc one
---
I grinded till h3, entered a loosing streak down to b3 in the start of the season. Gave up.  Pick up the radrix bs quest last week, reach the part that requires 25 comp game. Hello fabled.
---
I believe you have to be in a squad of 2-3 people highly recommend at least 3 night fall is rough.
---
Elitist opinion of the day: PvE is too easy and I welcome changes to make it even somewhat difficult
---
So you're saying the free points did it for ya.
---
Hey bro, I saw somewhere that ‚Äúforsaken‚Äù owners are getting destiny 2 year 2 annual pass for free on September 17th. So keep an eye on that. Good luck!!
---
This show fucking rocked!
---
Yea it's good for clearing corridors, not great for anything else.
---
The ones coming to me at reset Tuesday will take me over the threshold, yes.
---
Oh Witcher is a great game 
---
It's mainly due to RDO, F76, NMS, D2 and Detroit (Platinum run)
---
And then I end him point blank with my bow.
---
This meme is accurate though.
---
you need to buy Forsaken DLC to access the Forsaken  
---
to access annual pass content you need to buy annual pass  
---
the free one only contains base game, curse of osiris, warmind
---
there's no title screen or UI difference whether you have only the free version / plus forsaken
---
as long as there's an icon to buy, means you haven't purchased the expansion
---
Stop whining and use steam dude. Its vastly superior anyway.
---
I don‚Äôt know, I haven‚Äôt played it in a year and when I came back on I realised that the title screen said Forsaken and that I had the expansions
---
The only important part of the twab was the tether buffs tbh
---
Make sure to check your library that Forsaken is in it and installed. And of course make sure you‚Äôve redeemed your code for it, or whatever the case is for you (maybe obvious, but ya never know haha)
---
The title screen says forsaken for everyone dude regardless of what you own. I'm sorry to tell you this but you don't own forsaken. Bungie makes a new title screen that everyone gets whenever a big dlc comes out. Shadowkeep will have one too even if you don't buy it
---
That‚Äôs the thing, it says I don‚Äôt have it but I‚Äôve got the previous expansions, unless the base game now comes with those
---
Laggy guardians, these days it's a nightmare and I get one of those almost every single game. Can't shoot them because they literally teleport around
---
Ah I see your other comment now - the title screen says ‚ÄúForsaken‚Äù for everyone because that‚Äôs the season were in. Doesn‚Äôt mean you own it. The Y1 DLC were recently given out for free to everyone who at least had the base game.
---
Ahhh
---
woah ur really funny lol xd mod cringe max
---
If this is another Eververse set, I'll riot!
---
This needs to be a raid set, nothing else.
---
I‚Äôve noticed that you can‚Äôt buy Forsaken alone though
---
It was xqc, I was watching his stream on my second display.
---
Ever heard the term 'toxic masculinity'?
---
It‚Äôs called the crucible lol
---
They really dropped the ball on the moon armor. I was really hoping for some Eris Morn-inspired space witch hunter sets but instead we‚Äôre getting astronauts who just swam through a landfill.
---
It's not that it's hard to make the maps it's more they're too busy working on the extra PvE activites that get added.
---
Totally worth the buy if your wondering i dont promote buying expensive stuff for games but this is totally worth it. Its crazy how much there is now. 
---
Also a returning player
---
What armour is that?
---
But hey it kicks like a horse compared to 180s on the other hand ...
---
trash
---
Blueberries are the little blue dots on your radar/mini map
---
The base game comes with the previous exp
---
Crab rave intensifies
---
Honestly we all know it sucks but there‚Äôs really not much you can do but suck it up and go try hard. There‚Äôs nothing better than winning against the odds :)
---
Eris Morn inspired witchy tech
---
I love the confused emote
---
Me too. People just want the same vex armour every time its so boring
---
Damn. I came in here expecting to see people complaining and all I see is posts from Warlock mains celebrating their (soon to be) new found freedom to wear a different exotic. Love it!!
---
Two wrongs never make a right.
---
Eris Morn inspired armour.
---
Thank you.
---
Well thanks a lot. Yeah he likes playing sniper and he was looking for a good HC, and I like playing shotgun. We play on PC. We were also wondering  if armor or exotics played a big part in PvP ?
---
Winning the gunfight is not really the problem if you face them in a duel. The problem is coming across OEMs who already have overshields, it's not a fair fight and you get punished for doing nothing wrong, and ends up giving them another overshield. Also the infinite range on the mark, you shoot them once across the map and are tracked through walls for a very long amount of time.
---
Managarie is good farm activity for weapons and armor,  so i suggest you start there for equipment.  Armors are getting reworked next month so go for weapons first, in managarie farm a god roll for: Austinger (good primary handcanon), Beloved (good pvp sniper, you want snapshot for pvp),  and get a nice shotgun (almost any works but far mindbenders ambition from nightfall when its active).  Alternatively if you dont want to farm legendary weapons you can use exotics if you have them: Ace of spades (probly best primary weapon) or Last word if youblike it more, and then for energy weapon either: Lord of wolves (its still op and can melt supers up close), jotun (no skill weapon,  can be great or terrible depending on the map).  For heavy you need Hammerhead or (exotic)  Thunderlord or maybe a good grenade launcher if thats you forte. As for the armors almost any will do, except exotics,  if you are a titan use One eyed mask (kind of a cheat but still), and for hunters i guess wormhusk or something, doesnt really matter.  You might want to get two energy weapon "scavanger"  perks on your arms armor and class-mark armor depending on what weapon you use (shottgun,  sniper ect.) as for other perks if you can get a good reloading perk for specific weapon class or a targeting perk then use that but keep in mind that only enhanced perks really make a difference,  so dont bother to much with armor farming.
---
Whatever you say Aunor.
---
Funny enough titans might become the master race of D2 with the changes
---
they rule the pve buffs (weapons of light now beats well)
---
they have the strongest pvp subclass and exotic (bottom striker and oem)
---
Looks like the lovechild between a warlock and a Titan
---
...
---
I actually _really_ like it.
---
Oh boy that holiday on the Moon sure was fun. What should I kill now
---
Exactly this. I actually think it‚Äôs a very clever way to nerf Mountain Top and other single-round magazine weapons. Bare in mind they are releasing an exotic Rocket Launcher and Exotic Machine Gun that fires like a linear fusion rifle and I believe has a base mag of 3. I think this Luna and Barricade nerf are to reign in their auto-reload damage potential as well.
---
Yep. Lack of creativiy is totally right. Everything is just so lazy. Don't even get me started on stomp mechanic.
---
Embrace the Darkness, my friend.
---
And it took over a year.
---
Yeah but at least it‚Äôs not a fucking stupid ass shopping cart wheel meme
---
For real though it's like the warlock is cosplaying as a DIY children's owl Halloween costume.
---
He must have found something *interesting*
---
Surely a turbo controller will still work? Need to set if a mote or kill is recorded
---
Naaaw, mods must be warlock mains too. Shows how fucking touchy they are. Fucking space fairies.
---
Side note: do you know you can charge the cavalry? I didnt know about untill recently either. You just hold the shoot button to charge it

Then i become the crucible TITAN &gt;:D
---
Half of us would try to be the titan vanguard then, 
---
I‚Äôve tried, sooo many times
---
Is this funny or am I missing something?
---
Theyve made every DLC except Forsaken and Shadowkeep (Annual Pass is becoming free on Sept 17th-ish) and youre going to complain about reskinned raid armor and the price of the dlc when theyre
---
A) Been trying to deliver cross save on time
---
B) doing stuff with Google about Stadia
---
C) preparing for a giant platform migration to steam
---
Once did this with two hunters running Shadowshot....awkward as hell but we got it done.
---
All the people using AFK mods should be banned from the game. Once they are reported and Bungie looks into it.
---
It is just a really amped up version of the Curse of Osiris Eververse armor.
---
Yeah if it‚Äôs persistent AFK then they should receive a ban but for now we just gotta suck it up for now
---
I always die when I thundercrash xol, game says Imm out of the map or something
---
The entirety of Destiny 2‚Äôs first year actually. Replaying CoO and Warmind is such a chore
---
Weird how you‚Äôre getting downvotes and I‚Äôm not. Almost like I‚Äôm right and you‚Äôre wrong. Wild.
---
The game isn‚Äôt necessarily suffering from eververse. Even they said that the funding and budget to create Outbreak and Zero Hour came from the sales of Whisper ornaments. This shows how eververse sales end up benefitting the game. Also since eververse sets become ornaments, cooler armor sets in eververse isn‚Äôt necessarily bad because that unique look that you‚Äôre so focused on can be applied to any armor in the game, including raid armor or any other type of armor. You pay for the dlc congrats, you want a sticker? Bigger games like destiny and growing studios do require more funding and they often rely on mtx to do that. As long as weapons don‚Äôt become eververse exclusive, eververse armor remains to be used as ornaments, and they don‚Äôt go all EA on mtx, I think it won‚Äôt be that detrimental to the game.
---
Titan, Hunter, Warlock
---
Does Warden still ban people for running it under Linux? Destiny is only of the only reasons I'm still using Windows.
---
Maybe I m stupid but since Iza can only shoot 5 fully charged honed Edge i m not so sure if we will be able to kill a raid boss with that low of shot
---
The post doesn‚Äôt say ‚Äúall of Bungie is titan mains, change my mind.‚Äù
---
It‚Äôs not like Well of Radiance doesn‚Äôt give buffs anymore.  It just gives less damage than a barrier you can‚Äôt shoot through.
---
(:
---
Won't matter when Bungie introduces a new pinnacle weapon or something that rewrites the meta for PvE and PvP.
---
I just got it yesterday. I'm going to take it to PvP and get used to it before I try it in crucible again. I'm optimistic. I used to make people with the Antiope-D in Y1.
---
Ahh yes i can see it now.  Still looks amazing imo
---
The last Iron Banner was frustrating to say the least. Saw a lot of guys jumping, moving a few inches and firing their gun once then reloading.
---
Tried to push them off a ledge once or twice but ended up just reporting them.
---
You better believe it.  Bubble being a viable option? Sign me the fuck up.  Just don‚Äôt forget that Well is still a buff, and you can still use it if a Titan isn‚Äôt available.
---
He‚Äôs to dangerous to be kept alive
---
Well damage buff &lt; weapons of light damage buff (25%&lt;35%)
---
Only in Shadowkeep... I think.
---
It'll be available for bright dust before Shadowkeep.

I get to go back to GEOMAGS and LASER DONG!

Also, as a dedicated FIGHTING LION enthusiast, I'm still not going to run anything different than MTN TOP, FIGHTING LION, and OUTRAGEOUS FORTUNE.
---
Thanks, that's great will do.
---
Bro what hunters are best pve clas right now with nighthawk and top tree tether. If you have one warlock and one titan you can have four hunters and be doing great
---
You probably still will, *but* now Titans will have to run bubble. 
---
*Does this make it any better*? No 
---
*Should well be completely reworked*? Yes
---
Unrealistic body standards!

I pray every day and see I‚Äôll no loot :(

That‚Äôs just not true though

Anyone else not really see the point in afk going into crucible/gambit? Forges I understand for farming materials but still

Thank you! I am PC tho, made the switch couple months ago. It sucks being a solo player again it‚Äôs like year 1 all over again

How Dunn felt/looked before the crash.....too soon?

What is this place? Never seen it on D2
---
Nah.  They still do things.

What lol
---
‚ÄúFor some reason‚Äù

We all know the reason Eververse armor looks much, much better.
---
This is why people should try alt classes, so they don't come to conclusions as ridiculously wacky as this
---
F
---
The council will decide its fate.
---
The arc web can be a bit ridiculous, but that‚Äôs basically it at this point
---
Tbh thats actually beautiful though. Imagine if during an event at night in the city, warlocks put well of radiance everywhere in the city and on the tower like lanterns/lamps or whatever
---
Come October Warlocks will be cast aside as Bubble will have higher damage boost than Well and Titans also have rally barricade, making them able to buff teammates the same way Luna Well can without having to put on an exotic.
---
Not gonna lie the titan one looks dope af.
---
And it's feelsbadman
---
i am glad it looks like shit, you maybe op but you dont look cool, and thats enough for me
---
It does. I normally don‚Äôt play as a Titan, but I might just for that armor set!
---
Valkyrie**
---
Sorry, i just had a minor stroke trying to figure out what you meant by "cavalry". Its a personal thing
---
Is anyone doing Morgeth? But I only need chest and egg!! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
r/woosh
---
Dont take this man's happiness away
---
Lol
---
To be honest,the prestige battle pass armor should have been the raid armor
---
You stay, I go, no following
---
Are you soloing it for the challenge? Im sure you could find a fireteam otherwise.
---
BRING ME THANOS!
---
They are all pretty great and since they are Universal Ornaments you can just slap them on every piece of armor. 
---
Though now I am sad that I missed the Sunbracers Ornament that change them to the Osiris Style with Vex Milk instead of Fire, would have looked great. 
---
Also the D. A. R. C. I. s Mind of its Own Ornament has the exact same color scheme.
---
Or just be a Warlock with a Well.
---
Oh yeah! I forgot about that! ... but not Guiding Light so nah.
---
BUUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUUUUM!
---
My ears are still ringing from warmind.
---
When you‚Äôve been raiding for a few hour and you need a drink
---
FINALLY, a post about the new armor, that would be hilarious if it was.  Diggin most the new sets!
---
Ah I miss Ryan Dunn.....
---
Since d1 they‚Äôve had a hard on for titans
---
Those are ornaments
---
weapons i agree, but d2 armor...
---
I love them all! I will say that this SHOULD be the raid gear. But oh well!
---
If you dont own a ps4 you dont authenticate one. Same goes with xbox or even if you dont own a pc. You are only cross saving 1 account to all platforms that you own. So in my case i owned a ps4 and pc account, i cross saved my ps4 account to bnet and pc. Now i can play my ps4 account on bnet, and play on ps4 whenever i choose. On october 1st we will all migrate to steam if you play on bnet.
---
Mmmmmm yes love the giant spike on the titans arm
---
The armour was reduced on the suppers
---
As a one character warlock main, I request better armor.
---
With 10% less damage
---
If we check his tracker he most likely has 0.5 kda
---
imo revoker is the best sniper for new players
---
You on xbox?
---
If bungo Maine‚Äôs Titans they wouldn‚Äôt have gutted the sun breakers,
---
I‚Äôm all for a boycott of that stupid place. We should all stop going
---
wayyy better to ask for Sun Shot :D
---
Made in Mematic^tm
---
there are the swords on the Vex-set, still.
---
Eyes up, Tenno
---
Well obviously you want perks that work with your builds like scavenger perks to help keep your special ammo up and perks which help gain super or can help snap a crit don‚Äôt hurt either.
---
There‚Äôs a number of exotics depending on your play style again that can help but that depends on what you want to do. A lot of hunters run St0mp-EE5 for extra mobility but there‚Äôs also a load of others that can be helpful but you‚Äôd need to know what you‚Äôre building. Doesn‚Äôt hurt to throw stuff on and try it out in Quick Play or Rumble for how it feels.
---
I‚Äôm a fan of Doom Fang Pauldrons for Sentinel, Dunemarchers on Striker or Lion Rampants for general use on Titan but there‚Äôs also OEM it things get real sweaty (Fighting fire with fire as some put it).
---
not only that, it always sends me into OCD mode thinking i need to clean my screen
---
Well, we did want less Supers
---
Guess they saw that instead of only outright reducing the amount of Supers, they could also find more ways to shut Supers down
---

‚ÄúThis is going to hurt... a lot‚Äù 
---
Yeah you‚Äôre right it will hurt, my feelings.
---
Lmao
---
Did you ever play as a Defender in Y1
---
Watching uselessly as a Bladedancer Hunter's Razor's Edge attack could go *under* your Ward of Dawn and still damage you?
---
It was pathetic
---
Give him a chance, he hasn‚Äôt arrived yet! Give him about 1.5hrs then you can find where he is at www.whereisxur.com
---
Ohhh myyy
---
As I re-checked the change, it seems that the suppression on Shield Charge will be in it‚Äôs melee ability and not the super itself. I could be wrong, but it was worded that Shield Charge disorients, and on top will suppress. Sentinel Super‚Äôs melee attacks don‚Äôt disorient enemies struck by it.
---
In less than a month it should be better..right? Can't get any worse right? Ha..haha..
---
I believe he will be somewhere on Uranus
---
I like the armor and all, but why can‚Äôt us Titan mains have normal shoulders? I‚Äôd like to be able to fit through a door, thank you. Love the spike thing in the arm though.
---
Welp, [here's](https://i.imgur.com/go4hfGI.png) mine.
---
no
---
I can't believe one of the things I used to like about destiny was my guardian looking bad ass.. D2 armor design is something else man
---
I always feel great about myself when I‚Äôm at the top of the leaderboards in a PVP match as a Novabomb Warlock. I feel like I deserved it, especially when for about a solid three minute span, two or three times per match me and my fireteam are getting spawn fucked over and over again with juiced up bottom tier heat seeking Fists of Havoc bull shit just to get annihilated by Jotunn 5 seconds after that. 
---
PvP is an irritating place for space wizards
---
üòâ
---
They probably are having most or some of the PvP team go work on PvE content to make sure it comes out on time or is better. They did mention that sometimes they have to choose on whether or not they work on this content or other content and they have to decide and think what would the community like the most.
---
Does anyone else miss the original title screen music compared to forsaken?
---
Deku be like ‚ÄúSMAAAASSHHHH‚Äù
---
Wuuut
---
Huge difference in an exotic getting nerfed and a super tho.
---
Only messages I send are positive shit, wrecked me? Good shit. Similar play style? Hit me up if needing an extra. Doesn‚Äôt take much to not be a douche
---
imagine raids having worthwhile rewards, the casuals will never allow it
---
I want both hoodless capes and capeless hoods!
---
Yeah, to be honest I think it‚Äôd be more suitable if they were the other way around (except the cape/mark obviously)
---
And you get triumphs for will of thousands at 50k and for stunning Xol 3 times with Valkyrie
---
Bruh u mean
---
*sits in the living room as a warlock casually stabs a sword in my roof*
---
Can‚Äôt wait for all of the sherpas! Leviathan is gonna be fun.
---
Just reminds me: We've had the Forsaken title screen music for roughly a year. When Shadowkeep drops, the update should also have new title screen music, correct? 
---
If so, it's gonna be wild for the many people who came into Destiny 2 post-Forsaken - myself included. I can't wait!
---
Am I the only one worried about the vex crit spot they‚Äôve added on each set? So now we can be crit in the head AND chest?‚ÄΩ 
---
/s
---
Man I want a chiappa,  I just don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever carry it and it‚Äôs an expensive ‚Äújust because‚Äù gun.
---
Damn, you going to hit him with ~Dreg Fucker~?
---
I opened about 50 nodes and got about 20 schematics out of.  That is RNG for you.  
---
The best way to farm these is to fill up your consumable inventory (a little harder with the change to 9,999 stacks but still doable).   Make your nodes once you have consumable inventory and they will go to the post office.  You can then pick up the ones for a specific area and go open them.  I use DIM to transfer while on the planet and it works well. You always get dups, so only pull in one for each node at a time.  Makes Farming for schematics much easier.
---
Supposedly you get weapons other than the sidearm from gambit prime but since the loot update that‚Äôs all I e gotten.
---
The true reality is we can't get some capeless hoods so it's more like they're saying "No! Capes!" Since we are getting a hoodless cape next season.
---
I have had the most Futurescape codes drop when in Olypus Descent or the Drift.  You might also try Madame Subterrain Lost Sector in the Drift as a location to make codes.
---
Played gambit since the mode launched. Stopped playing d2 back in april. Played my first 2 matches wednesday and the shotgun dropped as a level up reward.
---
Righteous
---
God damn beautiful,
---
I use  [this online trimmer](https://online-video-cutter.com) for my videos. It's quick and easy to use.
---
I wouldn't say D2. Honestly MHW just released it's expansion after 18 months of release.
---
I had to use chrome to do mine.
---
Thanks appreciate it.
---
Glad to see the George Foreman grill survives through the ages into the Tower. And in orange!
---
That Warmind's end cutscene left me scared for some time is it just me¬ø¬ø¬ø
---
We need a Red Stone of Aja Stone Mask ornament for the Dire Skull of Ahamkara.
---
Wednesday, I managed to pick up Forsaken Legendary Collection on cdkeys for 30$. It let me download through Blizzard with the key.
---
Diiii duuuun
---
**DUN DUN DUN**
---
No cuz then they would nerf dawnblade for being sunbreaker on drugs
---
No we asked for the reakinned moon
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure New Light don‚Äôt get the raids but I could be mistaken.
---
Or when he takes the ogre and you think the missions done
---
‚ÄúIs that even possible‚Äù
---
TFW you shoulder charge ascendant primeval and want to chain with super but guess what you lost your melting point cuz he immune
---
Bro u lucky
---
You can set a macro on pc to do small movements so you don‚Äôt get kicked, so in gambit prime you can AFK farm weapons
---
Can‚Äôt wait for my cloak of taniks idc how long it takes to grind it out like in d1
---
I agree lol
---
As a 2nd main warlock, I only play it when I can use geomags
---
One two punch with cross counter and combination blow can rip a boss to shreds check out gladds video on it
---
cheers that explains Prime AFK'ing, if people are AFK farming prime for weapons then treat it like comp, and force a rejoin after each game
---
Ha! This Jackass...
---
Bro what? 1-2 punch only rolls on shotguns.
---
Definitely. Of all things, a 1,000 or so hours in Overwatch really helped me understand the importance of being aware of what supers/abilities the enemy team has and how to counter play them.
---
I mean it's been clear for however long OEM has been a thing that they have a huge bias towards titans and keeping them on top
---
Laughs in ssd
---
ive seen over 100k pve kills on one and about 10k pvp kills on em before. Nothing will ever top a dust rock blues I saw in season 4 when it was new with over 30k pvp kills.
---
Nice, took me 35 runs.
---
Shoutout to xengen for doing this with me
---
Xengens view: 
---
https://youtu.be/bvCgMRVYVkw
---
Valor or glory?
---
Yeah I know dude
---
I landed on Mars, ep was happening, threw a charged axion nade, went back to watching my show
---
Thems rookie numbers, pump em up
---
A hunter with OEM cuz you not thicc enough
---
They'll get the Y1 raids, so no last wish, but the essence is still there, first time showing new light players the dogs encounter is going to be interesting
---
I played comp against a guy name OMGitsOmar- and he has like 70K kills on his erentil
---
I have this same meme twice on my feed and yours is a garbage screenshot. You should feel bad.
---
Get the destiny 2 companion app
---
I‚Äôm in this picture and I don‚Äôt like it
---
I enjoy playing tf out of most of my games so that I can accurately describe my standpoint in conversation. If I like playing PUBG with all 1200 hours in it then I will talk about that. Or if I like all 842 hours on destiny 2 then I will talk about that. At some point. You will know everything there is about a game that you feel no need to talk about it anymore. I recommend to never play sans undertake for any longer than 400 hours. Or you‚Äôll end up like me with 1200 and a month of your life gone to sans.
---
I can't get anyone to do it with me, I'd really like to get the raid shotty
---
142 days later you ever get the armor you wanted
---
‚ÄúThat sounds cool, but super damage resistance nerf will do‚Äù.
---
-bungie
---
They should have permanently gotten rid of Bannerfall....
---
I think it set me back $55 usd with sleeve
---
Qp and iron banner when its live. Doesnt take long to get game going
---
Thanks for the help!
---
the ultimate sacrifice
---
Thanks!
---
Go for it!
---
"But Hunters should be the best at everything by a mile!! REEEEEEE"
---
- most of this sub, probably
---
Bring on your downvotes, Hunter mains, I'm used to it.
---
Overall, at any given time it is qp at about 12% of the overall population, comp at around 6% and the rest at 0 or 1%. Iron Banner usually gets about 25% when it is up.
---
Not sure about PC only but it is probably similar.
---
*insert cavalry charge here*
---
**my** biggest gripe about that tree is the melee, either buff the damage to make up for the wind up or shorten the wind up to compensate for the damage.
---
I don‚Äôt understand how these goats do this
---
I don't care about damage or anything it's just so much fun doing something like this. I honestly wasn't even thinking about it when this guy put a well down. And then it revved up and I didn't stop shooting and I was so excited lmao
---
Tbh, I legit thought of that as soon as I saw him
---
Yup, I have my main external where most of my games reside, and my SSD that I move whatever my flavor of the month is for boosted load times.
---
Best meme template I‚Äôve seen in months
---
There's at least one every week, lol. At least it's a lesson learned.
---
I don't see anywhere for trials 
---
;-;
---
I mean you didn‚Äôt know it was what you were gonna get
---
Of course, as we all know, true titans only wear OEM. Clearly a fake.
---
^^*ahem*
---
sounds like an scp
---
alright cool :D
---
I guess but hopefully it will come back better
---
" my retinas!" "Hey friends joining you in orbit...blindly"
---
no, not multiple. one or two people supporting his decision, but not bringing gender into it *at all*. you're the one who popped up with all the toxic masculinity and gendered insults bullshit
---
literally only you have a problem with the use of "bitch"
---
yeah, i downvoted because you're acting like a little snowflake bitch. and constantly saying "gah, what are you twelve? act like a fucking adult" doesn't mean i'm being childish or immature, that's you trying to project that onto me. 
---
sorry you disagree, but i frankly dont give a shit how you feel. if that bothers, stop being a child and grow the fuck up. the world isn't here to cater to you or your bullshit
---
:(
---
Sorry, but Warframe has the right mindset and has been doing F2P waaaaaay longer than Bungie and whatever Chinese company bought them out of their contract with Activision. There's really no comparison
---
Ok, so a friend has this on pc but wants to also play on Xbox. So if destiny 2 base game will be free on the 1st of October could they buy shadow keep and not have to pay for the base game?
---
Titans have been borderline worthless this past year. Just look at reckoning
---
Tell your friend to come over to my place, and I can show him some LoW.
---
Be careful, titans are very sensitive!
---
My friend says he needs an adult and also owns a gun so 'back off mister'
---
LD watchdog scope, quickdraw, Drop mag, rampage, range masterwork, counterbalance mod.
---
My favorite gun in Destiny 2
---
get on my level i got mine on the 7 same for my 1k
---
Worse thing is hearing invader down. And then, killed by architects with their tag
---
Used to be winter wolf with around 6k kills (if people are being dicks then NF with revoker)
---
Oh my god..
---
Ah, a man of culture, using autorifles in crucible!
---
I stopped playing after Osiris, just started again
---
I‚Äôm curious about it in shadowkeep with the scout buffs...
---
Its still decent, as well as most other random weapons. The only thing alot of people dont realize with "random" weapons is you  gotta pair them better than per say dust rock, lunas, wardcliff (ps i hate you people, not personally but y'all  just too extra)
---
They aren't?
---
Pulse rifles are very strong right now. Trace rifles too.
---
Auto rifles (minus suros) and scouts however aren't in a good place.
---
It‚Äôs not from eververse.
---
Looking at that weird giant pool of orbs near the boss
---
Whether or not he perceives it doesn‚Äôt change that it‚Äôs still less time and more beneficial.
---
I run Gahlrans Right Hand and Coldheart in crucible ( don‚Äôt ask me how it works, it just does )
---
Don't know much about that.......getting Last Word and not being able to hit the broadside of a barn with the hipfire different story.
---
That‚Äôs the wall brother
---
lmao, reminds me of when I finally got queen breaker from a fated engram......... aaaaand then xur was selling it next week.
---
Well you have all the range with one almost equivalent to a scout and another is a freaking laser. Rat king is also fun, yes even solo
---
So my second roll wasnt AS terrible lol....trying again after i get off work
---
_LAUGHS IN LION RAMPARTS WITH TRACTION_
---
I main Coldheart in crucible, I just felt like I could always depend on it in crucible
---
Its consistent, something winter wolf isnt always and most weapons arent necessarily  as consistent
---
[removed]
---
Feels bad
---
If you play D2, I 100% recommend picking up and playing through all of D1. Especially now it‚Äôs only about $30 I think for 3 years of content. Be prepared though for some quality of life changes added in D2 to be missing though.
---
