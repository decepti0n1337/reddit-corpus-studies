Oh yes, my mistake. I was just letting them get close to me. I‚Äôve totally never tried backing up while shooting how could I forget.

---
Lol damn that's cancer
---
Big yikes because your justification for liking Apex legends is that it feels chaotic. I respond by saying that Titanfall is FAR more chaotic. To which you responded saying you hated the game. Which means you don't really enjoy the chaos of the game and is contradictory to your earlier statement. That's why it's a big yikes.
---
Thanks guys. I did this with no raids or nightfalls.  Such a pain!
---
Nice, but I also go 11 other exotics in 4 days:)) (none from xur)

There‚Äôs things to solo. But if you really wanna do raids it‚Äôs not that hard to find people. As well as Sherpas. Saying ‚ÄúI have no friends‚Äù is an excuse to not do raids. Plenty of lfgs/discord‚Äôs to find people. Just got to put the effort in. I knew absolutely nobody when I started. Made some really good friends through these over time. There‚Äôs good people out there too!
---
Its not contradictory Titanfall is a little TOO chaotic for me but Apex is the sweet spot. Imagine telling people what they can and cannot enjoy? Big yikes
---
Kill clip is better for pvp because its about a 50% bonus after one kill and rampage is better for pve because you can get to 60% after 3 kills and you dont have to reload to activate it

Consider yourself covered in shrapnel, debris, and blood. Covered.

For what reason? If it fills up then go to the tower or let it go into your postmaster.

Well, i can't even solo run the malfeasance story quest, do you reckon soloing this is doable for me?
---
Hello guardian, what puzzles do you bear?

heavy weapons slow you down and prevent skating, you need a light frame wep, like mida

Bye, have fun w anthem

I was late to the party, I didn't get the same until it was free on PC like 6 months ago

Counter play with load outs feels so satisfying in doubles.

Coming back from losing 0/0 to 5/4 in one match to completely reverse the score in the next just by switching up gear is hugely satisfying from a game strategy perspective

I've flashed my BIOS and I'm reinstalling the game for good measure. Have you got any idea how I can stop my GPU resetting and why it only seems to happen in missions?

Thankfully I had the Jotunn to melt everything. I hate the damn map where you fall in the lava. Probably lost more motes to falling off the map than enemies. Damn warlock jumps

I was thinking about this the other day. I would love it as a playlist for a week or so. I think it would be a lot of fun 
---
Man I was gonna go ape if he ignored my ghost
---
i just need it because i have the collector mindset. if its in the game i need it, any chance i can get i'll take to get something i don't have
---
I need a full collection of EVERYTHING from truimphs to weapons to flairs to even the most ugliests of ghosts
---
what motherboard do you have? and what version bios?
---
also no you are correct this is legit just a normal ghost with a terrible texture on it...but because of my collector mindset....i need it.
---
First off, take a break from D2. It always works.
---
Secondly, weapon design is not the exact same you're just tripping. What you said is somewhat true for blue guns, but for legendaries? THat's an entirely different story. I just look at my entire DIM vault and found around 3 similarities in all of my guns, AND armor. You also state that raid weapons are mediocre and not greatly designed. Last Wish has very unique designs, so I don't really get what you're going at? SOTP is a Crota sized raid and the whole theme is that the Kell's Scourge have stolen black armory weapons and modified them, so obviously they have their own theme.
---
Then you go on to say that you always fight the same enemies over and over again.
---
**WHAT?!** In TTK the Dreadnaught had Cabal, Hive and Taken. Mars had Cabal Fallen and Taken, Venus had Vex, Taken, and Fallen, The Moon had Fallen and Hive, Earth had Fallen, Hive and taken, and even the plaguelands have taken!
---
You wanna know why you fight these enemies a lot? Because you're attacking where they're supposed to spawn. Now listen closely: **YOU FIGHT THE SAME ENEMIES BECAUSE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE THERE!**
---
Now, I'm trying to read the rest of the post without losing brain cells, so I don't apologize if I butcher this:
---
We've always had resets in D1. We've always had limits on how much light level we could get up to in a week. Only this time it puts more emphasis on it with the milestones. If you have amazing luck you can get 3 prime engrams in a normal 4-5 hour session. Milestones guarantee you twice that much in as much, or even less time. I counted around 19 different powerful reward milestones. You could do those all in one day.
---
I guarantee if you quit to go to Anthem you will end up in the same exact position. Take a break. Come back when you're not salty about nonexistent problems that only exist for you.
---
CLAP what system are you on? I like to try and group up with people my age, maybe try some pvp, I play but not much.
---
This was beautiful.

I cried when the hunter leapt in front of you.  Has happened to me. And by me. 
---
Except we're not flying planes. We're playing a first person shooter. Your analogy doesn't work here at all. At the end of the day it's just a matter of preference.
---
Ok you made some good points I but I‚Äôm saying I dislike the weekly system Ik. It‚Äôs been here for a while but the last wish guns just are not as cool as some of the raid guns from d1 black armory looks alright but that is my point what is there to do power wise when you can get it done in a day but thanks I will come back to d2 most likely when it has a new big update AGAIN this is my opinion 
---
Thanks to Crimson Days, comp is full of stacks and more stacks. I went from making consistent 5% progress per day to nothing.  And next week is Iron Banner so I'm looking at doing this 1% at a time in QP and IB for the next weeks.
---
Clap clap

Well, found my new background.
---
It's a fairly old one by now. Gigabyte Z97X Gaming 7. Latest BIOS is from 2015. Using a GTX 780ti too. Which runs all my other games, even recent ones, perfectly with no issues whatsoever. I'll give the clock speed a shot if the BIOS flash and reinstall don't work.
---
thats a 450 tho, anyway I‚Äôll give it a go. 
---
Just pull your mouse down half an inch.
---
Joker's Wild is bringing many new things, including a new gambit experience. We'll have to wait and see what those are. Penumbra is bringing 2 new activities, with possibly more with those 2 redacted signs.
---
The game is in a dry state right now. But this is nothing compared to What we had in House of Wolves to TTK or even TTK to ROI.
---
Arms week was hyped by the community and it was never mentioned at all by Bungie.
---
I must admit I wasn't bummed about trials not coming back since I never could compete at that level, but I do know that it was important for basically everybody else. I am bummed about FR not coming back for some time, but they haven't said anything concrete so I'm betting it will come back, because factions are a BIG staple of the entire Destiny Universe.
---
Try to refrain from using 'We' in these statements, that's an easy way to get flamed.
---
Some of the problems you listed are valid, though.
---
I like all of these options, all the parcel of stardusts ive got havent come with full auto but I saw Cammy using one and it‚Äôs pretty insane. Also for the age old bond is that the one that has fourth times the charm?
---
Apex just killed it though
---
Lmao! Blueberry rng at its finest
---
Thanks :) got the medals with their sacrifice for sure haha
---
So did Fortnite, Anthem and Warframe apparently, yet here we are
---
The hell you talking about? Balanced glide is the best. 
---
This is the worst part of this map
---
The best part is if your enemies just fall back to spawn when you invade it's really easy to kill them.
---
This is probably the map I made most of my Army Of One.
---
Did you check the roll? I've been getting some surprisingly good perks on dupe armor

The one when you always get into after your teammates are so far away you wanna return to orbit.
---
Already had a better roll. 
---
Where‚Äôs toes?
---
I respect you responding to my reply,
---
The weekly system,like I said, has been around since D1.
---
ROI made it even easier to hit max light even without doing raids.
---
You do realise that the raid designs in WOTM were literally just foundry weapons with siva attached, right?
---
VOG‚Äôs weapon designs were mediocre at best, usually taking the form a what we have as blue weapons today.
---
King‚Äôs fall weapons were the only really unique raid weapons back then.
---
The next few seasons with the annual pass will give us loads more content than before. Not to mention the big expansion expected in September.
---
I reccommend coming back during March because lots of people will be getting ready/ playing the new season including the annual pass.
---
I hear Anthem is also dead. Which is funny because the game isn't even technically born yet. 
---
Literally the worst masterwork IMO
---
I've been trying to do it on heroic missions and low level stuff and I get sick of both those guns after 5 minutes
---
I finally got the quest to drop yesterday and I'm still on the first step...Congratulations. 
---
Guess I've been lucky, I've been playing gambit a few days and had meatball 3 times. That Dreaming city mission step tho, yikes 
---
I mean, you can solo *most* of VoG; you just need 2 more people to make sure you can progress through the full raid.
---
No just grinding for malfeasance but I'm having fun in Gambit because it's something different than the usual grind. 
---
Sorry :(
---
I don't play a ton, but I play a decent amount of gambit, and that was my first meatball. Luckily we summoned it way before the other team got their PE so we were able to kill it. 
---
Lol your doing it in comp? Just do it in quickplay 2-5 % per match
---
So you took out ghaul
---
Haven't tried it in Gambit yet because it's hard to put down the Jotunn but having fun using it in strikes 
---
Ah yeah maybe that was you when I got I killed twice by the same invader lol 
---
If you choose to solo que all the way up to dredgen or just to max infamy (which i did because i wasn't in a rush), your progression will essentially become a function of time. Play long enough and you'll etch away at the title triumphs. But along the way, you'll probably get very good at invading to the point where you'll be able to pull more than your own weight in matches and increase your odds of winning even with randoms. But if you're strictly going for win streaks, you will need to que with a stack. It really depends on how you play your game and if you're trying to maximize your wins in a certain amount of time (i.e. you set aside a few hours to play after work/school) or just go in just to shoot stuff (which admittedly is often my attitude). As pointed out before, it sounds like you know what you're doing but just like any group activity, coordination will make obtaining wins easier, dare I say nearly guaranteed. LFG will probably do you really well if you're trying to go for a streak. Most people looking to fill a stack will have a similar mindset as you in terms of going for win streaks. Just watch out for those random john wicks along the way, even a stack won't save you. But you'll definitely have much longer streak with a group which seems to be the consensus. 
---
I'm a sad boy with no Jotun yet. I'm literally making a second character so I can have more chances per week at getting it. Only BA exotic I have is Izanagi's Burden...even then I never use it. I mainly use Malfeasance or Bygones in my primary so it never sees play because when I need a sniper Whisper is there. 
---
The curated is 4th time and rampage, yeah. A dragonfly roll with something like Zen moment can be nice to use too.
---
I've been getting them off and on lately, especially with dismantling gear.  I've also been getting connection errors of and on even though i have the recommended ports open. 
---
Jeb Bush clap request is awesome.

As 35 year old who only played Goldeneye before Destiny as far as shooters are concerned, I can tell you that you should feel proud.

Wow dude he is just posting his conversation. I found it funny I beat my friends all the time and I even get hate mail from them some times and I send them hate mail when they beat me so it is just funny.

Be happy that your hallowfire dupe wasn't some piece of shit with sidearm loader or kinetic ammo finder

I don‚Äôt check the daily strike list enough to know what‚Äôs offered. NOTE: the daily strike list should not be confused with the heroic strike playlist. Daily and heroic mean different things.

---
Why is everyone on reddit so toxic i joined 3 days ago and now i just want to uninstall 
---
This would be cool in theory, but it would need restrictions. Like, someone shouldn't be able to trade something like a Luna's or a Last Word because the other player should earn that. Random things however, like it's a random drop would be cool. Then again, the collections system would be broken then, because then your team could get really good stuff all at once. I like the idea. But if it was there I'd come to dislike it. 
---
Not myself destiny is dieing because of lack of content or insentive to grind. 3 years of dedicated play and it's never felt this bland. Catalyst should help but it feels like the devs spark is gone. Black armory was truelly shit. It did 1 cool and innovative thing and that was giving us a way to grind for specific rolls on certain guns. When you compare that to everything that is gone or on hiatus it's definetly fading. It's not dead yet but it is hurting. 
---
&gt; There‚Äôs a steady stream of posts of players who had never played  destiny, never planned on playing, who recently got it for free and fell  in love.  
---
A rookie reporting in, sir! I started in november during the giveaway, made it to 25 and instantly bought the Forsaken + CoO &amp; Warmind bundle. No regrets. Currently a 570 power Warlock (Hunger).
---
Here is a clap. "A single clap." Heh, get it? Good job man!
---
Fun to use against mobs of ads. kind of wish it was a faster ROF. imagine the firework show it could put on with dragonfly spec. 
---
Thank you very much, i was looking for the original. 
---
I mean as long as they didnt do what they did at the beginning of black armory to Jokers Wild then it would probably be more appreciated
---
Ghost Scans glow like that when you go into Nav Mode. This was a big feature of the Taken King DLC on the Dreadnaught of Destiny 1 as well. It wasn't ever explained in D2.
---
Additionally, when you are near a scanner, there will be a flashing Ghost symbol in the top right corner of the screen, and when you go in Nav Mode there is a clicking sound. And your Ghost will actually look at the scannable and you can follow him to find it.
---
Awful, melt it for the shader.
---
I find larger maps are better for my aging eyes and terrible twitch reflexes.
---
I never said it wad hard. Its just extremely boring
---
*Hunter claps*
---
Public event incoming!
---
Which only proves my point.
---
I feel your pain brother, I finished this quest last week.
---
No
---
When it has the forsaken symbol, it means that you can only aqquire it through having forsaken, as gambit needs forsaken.
---
It isnt season exclusive, but its GAMEMODE exclusive
---
Yea that‚Äôs true it reminds me of the armor grind for the solstice of hero‚Äôs event 
---
Dude I got forsaken and the annual pass I just took some time off destiny 2 a couple weeks after forsaken dropped because of some personal matters coming up 
---
Yeh dont sweat it. Its a random drop from the gambit gamemode. Just play gambit and it will drop. 
---
OR
---
If you keep playing gambit and one dosent drop, you can reset your infamy rank (prestige it) and get one from the drifter
---
thanks for the advice I‚Äôll keep that in mind ü§ô
---
Because 15 motes bro. 
---
What dance is that?
---
\*applauds aggressively\*
---
This man has the right idea.
---
powerful engrams have a better chance of being exotics. so you're missing a lot by not playing these things 
---
Yes 
---
Guardians and Tenno aren't enemies, they are cousins (banjo intensifies).
---
I've already done that quest and the malfeasance quest twice on 2 separate characters and I still haven't reset my infamy once.
---
Same bro
---
RIP
---
That is trinity ghoul and between them monarque is way better
---
Yeh they made all other forges irrelevant all u need for any frame is mars lost sector and bergusia, hoping jokers wild season is better, I'm just so burnt out with destiny and it's upSetting considering I put 5000 hours into d1 but d2 is nothing like d1 even now they done stuff 
---
Im a huge bow fan actually in this game. What is monarques special perk though 
---
\*Triple Jumps\*
---
I'm not pvp mainly but even I can acknowledge pvp is hot trash, what happened to the d1 banner weapons? Clever dragon etc? They wer unique and god we grinded, why not bring trials back as it was? It worked, it was hugely popular till its last day, what happened to a d1 map each banner returning? Big maps? Combined arms? Rift? Shit the way ther bringing back old weapons ther argument for wanting fresh stuff is bullshit
---
I laugh imagining some idiot paying for Luna's/NF and then struggling to ever proc magnificent howl.
---
Why does everyone say that they've done X amount of runs but not have something drop? I checked on raid report out of curiosity and you have 40 looted runs, still a lot of runs and i respect that but why be misleading? 
---
In the competitive playlist: You win, you get 40 glory points. You lose, you lose30 glory points. You on a win streak, you get a lot of glory points.  
---
In the other playlists: You win, you get valour points. You lose, you get some valour points. You on a win streak, you get a lot of valour points.  
---
End game is still unfolding, but it's mainly about raids, in which there are some banging exotics and other gear.   
---
The new season will start in the \[beginning of March\]([https://destinynewshub.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/destiny-2-forsaken-dlc-roadmap.jpg](https://destinynewshub.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/destiny-2-forsaken-dlc-roadmap.jpg)).
---
*Breakneck wants to know your location*
---
It‚Äôs not misleading lol. Just because it‚Äôs 40 looted runs doesn‚Äôt mean I haven‚Äôt sherpa‚Äôd runs and taught runs. It all matters in the effort you put in imo. 
---
Also don't forget their OEM overshields Jotuun and Dustrock blues!
---
That being the exception
---
Fair enough, it's just whenever I see that I'd assume they were all looted. Anyway, props to you for nearly finishing the title, still need the sparrow myself.
---
Trust?
---
Thanks man! Just gotta keep pushing. I was convinced last week I‚Äôd never get this sparrow and then I got it this week on my final chance. 
---
It does "poison" (void) damage to the target and surrounding targets. Side note way quicker draw time then trinity
---
There are 2
---
I just reset for the first time last night. Ugh... 
---
Yea exactly, Destiny has its own uniqueness that a lot of people enjoy and shaming it by calling it dead is no way a game should be named. 
---
I can only say one thing there, look at your down votes. 
---
Same with Fortnite. There's no comparison as one is based around PvP and one is based around PvEvP
---
The most people who are trying to hype it up are the White Knights of r/Anthem

It's a game with million of players and a huge community that is pointing out to the stuff they don't like to the developer, if you went as far as reading a bit on the sub and asking this question I assume you are you are interested in the game! If it appeals you 20 bucks is a good deal!

Are you on pc? If yes I can share with you a a code for the referral program which is going to unlock some stuff for both of us and we can play together!

Hand cannons are great. Even though I've played since D2 launch, I recently found out that the "Ballyhoo Mk. 27" is the SHIT. I love that damn gun

---
As a hunter, I feel confused.
---
I mean, we're in a pretty good spot, we can't complain
---
‚Äîstay strong Guardian!‚Äî **embrace the Darkness, it feels strong...**
---
What are you on about? Warlocks get no attention what so ever. I main a warlock, and the other 2 classes are 650 as well, and I can tell you right now when it comes to PvP warlocks get no love whatsoever. 
---
Where‚Äôs the second?
---
No, we're not. We have maybe 2-3 useful subclasses for PVP. Spectral Blades are very good, but the other 2, Blade Barrage and Arcstaff, suffer from weak Subclass Trees.
---
Additionally, every other class does what we do, but better, and we also have the worst class ability. We're not in a good spot.
---
&gt;absolutly
---
absolutely
---
&gt;intension
---
intention
---
Still funny, though:).
---
Yeah, as a hunter I feel like I definitely can hold my own in both PvP and PvE.
---
I've played Warlock. Warlocks have amazing exotics, great subclasses (including Dawnblade which I say is the best PVP super in the game because of it's Tree and super), intuitive design, and the most useful Class Ability in the game. You guys are fine.
---
Whoever made this meme has to go back to school my lord (friend sent this to me btw)

---
Might just be someone who doesn't have English as a main language. I cringe, but I can't be mad about misspelled words haha.
---
Things like 'might of' when it should be 'might have' do really annoy me.
---
Yeh, as a hunter I feel I definitely can hold my own in PvP and contribute well to PvE activities. I feel that all the classes are fairly well balanced atm with the exception of the titan with OEM which is a a little bit OP atm. 
---
Only massive spelling mistakes annoy me, but one thing I truely gets the blood boiling is when people spell ‚Äúok‚Äù and not ‚Äúokay‚Äù its personal preference but I still hate it aha
---
^i think you mean...
---
#SYLOK, THE DEFILED, THIRSTS FOR YOUR LIGHT
---
Honestly, as much as it's a beast at clearing adds, add clearing isn't usually the issue in most activities, so it's usually ignored in favour of boss melting exotics.
---
That's my take on it anyway 
---
^^i think you mean...
---
#SYLOK, THE DEFILED
---
Its really nit the best pvp super in the game. You get like 10 charges and thats not alot especially as you have basically zero damage resistence and the abilities lack. Apart from icarus dash which is decent but can hardly save you and floating in the ajr and shooting which is nice. The bottom tree only is good for tracking. And we dont have good exotics the only decent exotics we have are aphidia  aspects (i think there called that) ehich boosts are melee range, lunas and skull of dire ahamkara which is really only good in pve and basically and beta version of orpheus rigs. 
---
r/yesyesyesno
---
Noo, st-st-stay back...
---
Ok
---
üëèüëèüëè
---
Dont blame him, i have a deep hate for luna too bjt maybe an over recation though
---
Triggered to the max
---
I don't think so. TLW was incredibly streak-dependant; a lucky five-streak was worth ten individual kills or so, but trading kills and deaths meant your progress was basically stagnant.  Trading kills on Chaperone means you progress 20% slower, so 25 kills per element instead of 20.
---
Chaperone also locks in progress so you don't ever run the risk of dropping to zero after making solid progress.   It's too bad Mayhem isn't available, since it's by far the best way to get Chaperone kills, but really just camping lanes with any elemental pulse rifle or aping with any elemental shotgun will fill up pretty quick.  Just focus on one element at a time with subclass, heavy, and elemental weapon and you'll be fine.
---
Everyone has their pet peeves, I guess haha. I gave up on being annoyed by misspelled/misused words on the internet. It's a crucible of so many nationalities, and I feel like I just can't expect everyone to be a native speaker or to be fluent in a foreign language. In a perfect world...
---
good guy bungie trolled me twice today too, double exotic drop from a single gambit match. pretty sweet right? not when its double sweet business
---
I say ‚Äúthree‚Äù as ‚Äúfree‚Äù so I try to avoid saying it at all costs, most people use keyword language now anyway which is fine though. Hopefully one day a perfect world is possible aye 
---
I've wiped entire teams twice with Bottom Tree Dawnblade in competitive and it is my go-to Super Shutdown since it has crazy mobility once active. You have just as much damage resistance as the other classes and the fact you can accelerate to mach 4 with your Glide means it shouldn't be an issue if you use it well.
---
And as for "We don't have good exotics":  
---
Karnstein Armlets: (Personal favorite, won a 4v1 by melees alone cause of the insane healing)  
---
Ophidian Aspect  
---
Contraverse Hold  
---
Geomag Stabilizer  
---
Starfire Protocol  
---
Chromatic Fire: (Kills nearby enemies with an Ace of Spades Headshot via 3 unavoidable explosions)  
---
Phoenix Protocol:  
---
Crown of Tempests: (Gives you energy for doing good with energy)  
---
Eye of Another World: (ability energy just for being equipped, highlights like OEM and Foetracer)  
---
ALL of those can be used in PVP to great affect
---
I'm convinced that people like that don't know how to evaluate something except in the comparative sense. Warframe can't be good unless Destiny 2 is bad, etc. 
---
I play them both, though I've been spending more time on Destiny 2 because none of my friends play Warframe. They are, as you pointed out, very different games that satisfy different playstyles.
---
Xbox? I‚Äôd be happy to help if you haven‚Äôt found anyone yet. PM me
---
This sounds like a case of "I dont know how to use my class properly"
---
I've been doing the Lunas Howl grind for a while, and I've had zero issues or complaints with my Hunter. I only really use my Hunter for PVP anyway.
---
Clap from a 26yo who enjoys pvp and is ok at it  but wont touch it because of the current meta and sweat level 
---
i like high impact gun, year 1 i almost exclusively played with [Agamid](https://db.destinytracker.com/d2/ru/items/1406475890-agamid)
---
since i got several Duke with outlaw or rapid hit + rampage +  Armor-Piercing Rounds, the best gun in game impact of a truck with a great range.
---
recently i got the Kindled Orchid in curated roll, range is not fantastic but the impact with 3x rampage + killclip 
---
52 really! That's cool as hell man
---
I've been playing and Maining Hunter since D1. Just because you don't have any complaints doesn't mean there aren't issues. I had someone with 1000 hours on Hunter in Destiny 2 alone tell me to "Make a Warlock" for the Luna's Howl grind because Hunters are absolute garbage.
---
I tried Warlock, and let me say, jumping that Power Gap was a trip.
---
I usually run it in gambit. Get motes stupidly fast. Bad Omens is my heavy and usually have a Distant Relation as an energy.
---
450 RPMs didn‚Äôt get any love though üòï
---
That's fair. I personally prefer tractor cannon for primeval, so I don't use exotics in other slots. 
---
I wouldn't be surprised if they're kissing cousins
---
Mine has light mag so reload isn't too bad, combining that with hand cannon loader, unflinching light arms and OEM on my titan, it's an absolute monster.
---
Use it while you can it‚Äôs getting nerfed soon 
---
Even though I‚Äôll regret saying that
---
Is that a Frontier Justice? I haven't seen one of those in a decade...
---
Apparently, there are because mine are different from what we see here.
---
You mean truly ;)
---
&gt;While they do have the best vertical movement, that's **not really useful for any type of combat situation.**
---
With the number of would-be melee kills I've lost to hunters jumping straight up and slightly back, I'm going to call bullshit.
---
Skating is OP and ridiculous, but that doesn't invalidate other niche advantages.
---
1. Absolutly
---
2. Intension
---
Still don't have Tractor TBH. RNG has been rotten.
---
Ya know, for some reason energy hand cannons have never done it for me. The feel and sound of them have never worked for me and I just can't use them in crucible or PvP. The only energy HC I can use is Trust and that's because it sounds and feels so good.
---
When you run straight at them and still miss, makes me want to throw my whole house out the window.
---
No 
---
He's sitting on my bookshelf üëç
---
Then you manage to succeed once in 5 tries and everyone is like

OMFG TITAN HAS 1 HIT MELEE AND ITS SUPER OP
---
Considering Rampage will be like a, what, 20% damage boost, instead of a 50% damage boost, Rampage is quite shit unless you get three stacks in PvP.
---
Hey, be careful. When threatened, hunters are known to emit a deafening screech of "muh shoulder charge" to call a pack of nearby hunters for safety. 
---
When you're surrounded, just say "Wormhusk Crown" to trigger a temporary bout of amnesia and disorientation as the hunters wipe that moment from their memory, so they can continue acting like they didn't have their time in the spotlight already.
---
I honestly thought they'd be trash when I first picked them up, but now they're my go-to PvP exotic.
---
No, not really

Just go on YouTube and search for a speed run of SOTP. They use that method all the time since it speeds the process up by a whole lot.

Have you met our our Lord and savior TractorCanon, booper of all boops
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm bad at hunters, and I‚Äôm not going to listen to counter arguments or advice‚Äù is a better title based on these comments
---
Well, again you seem not to be aware of what thread you're in. Also, it kinda looks like you're downvoting everything I say because you disagree with it, which isn't what the downvote arrow is for, btw‚Äîupvote/downvote on Reddit are meant to represents "contributes to the conversation"/"does not contribute".
---
The whole point of the thread is for those of us who are interested in this sort of content to speak up and let Bungie know. *You* assume there are a tiny number of players who play solo, but are also actively coming into the thread to attack and downvote anyone who expresses an interest in playing solo, effectively trying to silence us and get us to stop asking for what we want. Questioning our intelligence &amp; sanity for even wanting to play solo. Ignoring our explanations and questions to continue belittling and berating us. It's really sad to see.
---
To keep on subject: Statistically, the overwhelming majority of Destiny &amp; Destiny 2 players primarily play the game solo. Solo players are *not* a tiny majority‚Äîraiders are. Bungie knows this. Anyone who takes a few minutes to research the stats knows this. Even your prior comment understood that if there were a solo version of a raid, most of the people playing it would not gather a group to play it‚Äîbecause most players prefer to play solo.
---
I don't know about OP or other people in this thread, but while I'd greatly prefer to see old raids retrofitted with solo modes, I'd definitely be more satisfied by Destiny's future direction if even just *future* raids were designed with both solo and multiplayer modes included. It would be much easier to accomplish if it were part of the initial design, rather than requiring an overhaul of old code.
---
Financially, this is the reality: There's not much reason for solo PvE players (again, the vast majority of Destiny players) to pay for the Annual Pass in its current form. Something as simple as explicitly committing to making all future PvE content playable solo would open *a lot* of wallets.
---
Clap. Clap.  Well done.  From a 50yo working on this quest myself. 
---
What is the hidden triumph/Objective
---
Mind blown
---
I've been doing it in quickplay the whole time and at 53%. It's not that bad, there are more enemies, so more chances for double kills.
---
While gg may not have high or good damage resistance, its because you one shot people and blade barrage is very hard to counter kill.
---
Arc strider may have unnecessarily complicated combos, but it is a highly agile class that people have a very difficult time pinning down while in your super and while the perks aren't great, they're not trash, mostly its just the new melee people have trouble with.
---
And shadowshot usually has the enemy going "oh shit" when they get caught in it, so unless they've been tethered countless times (not likely since no one uses shadowshot) they'll probably have a bad reaction to it. Turning invisible can also help situationally, shadowshot is a viable option, just not a popular one. Especially since smoke bombs and shadowshot in top tree can linger until someone walks by it, you can stick around or defend the area to surprise someone with a tether.
---
plot twist, it's mayhem

‚ÄúArc trees have incredibly complicated combos‚Äù

I run Breakneck &amp; The Ringing Nail in gambit, scrubs out them ads. Kudos on the shader tho!
---
Can I get some contacts with this gif? Love to know what the fuck is going on here
---
I just don't get why people must fanboy and burn through a game and then complain while changing to another. Dude we get it, you got burnt by playing too much. Maybe if we all play what we want (destiny, sea of thieves and star citizen for me) maybe you keep calm and carry on between patch notes and content releases happily.  It works with TV series, why not for games?
---
I play the game for the aesthetic, why save the galaxy if you can't look fly while doing so! 
---
Just so you know selling a Blizzard account is against the ToS.
---
The annual pass is all end game only content. With one exception, all the guns it adds have comparable versions you can get without having it (the one exception is Hammerhead, a legendary machine gun). 
---
If you don't play **a lot,** it is possible that you could have the annual pass and not be able to play it for months on end, because it is all end game. 
---
[This page has a chart showing pretty much all we know](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/47465) about what will be added to the game over time for players with the base game, with Forsaken, and with the annual pass.

Hey, i did that 100% solo, and now I‚Äôm working on soloing redrixs broadsword, I‚Äôm about done but the honor resets will be the bane of my existence! Have fun with the gun , it‚Äôs crazy

While we are on the topic, I've had the perfect paradox wuest in my inventory for weeks now and I've never had a fossilized hermaion blossom drop. Any reason why? 
---
Oh a wall of text. Nah
---
That's how it is now. Bc of all the new games that came out recently the only players in comp are the ones that live and breathe comp playlist. Me and my classmates hit fabled in 32 games this season by playing comp in the first month of the season. It was a lil tougher in season 4. Taking about 60 games. But it's a lil late for a fabled run this season. Early in the season is when all the not that good players try to make a punch for fabled which dilutes the player base. Fabled is super reachable. I'm an average pvp player at best. 1.63 tops and I hit fabled in every season except for season 3. You can do it. Just start the grind earlier.

They are *very* rare to get from normal strikes. Have you tried doing nightfalls? 
---
Lmao
---
This is how I feel bringing Thunderlord into Gambit.  It might be a mega-crutch, but the dopamine hit of constant victory outweighs the shame.
---
I don't know either. I play tons of strikes and I've had 1 drop, total.

So as a solo player is there any point of me attempting some of the more difficult nonraid activities 
---
I assume whisper is doable but shattered throne is significantly harder?

Trying to figure out what questlines I should just ignore for the moment

People that pay for either of these guns are the peasants.

If you look closely you can see him get rezzed by his ghost. In all seriousness I have no idea how he even got up after that.
---
51 here and I‚Äôm so stuck at that solo mission and I spent the greater part of a day trying to do it solo and I came so close so many times. Can‚Äôt stand that stupid stomp every single boss has not to mention the damage inducing hoop that sends you off into the void where you die over and over again. I will beat that bastard!  
---
 that intecepter driver saw through the situtation and was advising you to not pick it up 
---
Wait, that's illegal 
---
No the best is that map..... and you have a teammate watching you jump across with 15 motes and he deliberately jumps in front of you so you fall to your death
---
Me and a few clanmates love saying "Destiny Sucks! warframe better cuz free!" whenever something slightly wrong happens in a session. Never gets old
---
Nice roll! If I may suggest a couple of thjngs: Ricochet Rounds not only buff stability for shot grouping, but they stealth buff your range. I'd highly recommend either backup mag mod or rampage spec.
---
That's a badass gun! Enjoy.

Can you get engrams from the postmaster using apps? I use the Ishtar app but I can't get them

Nah it‚Äôs a Fusion Rifle duh 
---
Okay... so that's why so many people spam the hell out of crucible
---
Yes. Either late in D2's timeline or at the start of D3. We are approaching what I would consider a paradox where the queen just left us to talk to Elsie aka The Exo Stranger, and I believe the Queen was talking to Elsie in that D1 cutscene on Venus. 
---
Yes.
---
I always forget emotes! God damn it I need to stop for getting that. Super useful to peek around corners
---
What sort of animal is that cool thing?üòÖ
---
Indeed it is
---
Now try it in MS Paint
---
I know it's effective but this is the most boring, uncreative loadout. Definitely detrimental to this game. (Not directed at you, just venting)
---
Think there is any way we can request Bungie for this? Some sorta online feedback form or something?
---
Bwuhhhh, damn it bobby. That achievement is more frustrating than getting army of one‚Äôs. Not as rare as light v light though so hoping you get that win! May blueberry rng bless youüëä

if that kid had it equipped he might not be running 
---
I helped a buddy get his legendary rank in gambit. We did a melt, so I was a Melting Point Titan. I used a Jotunn with a Light Reactor Helmet to build up super for add clear. Was super good. 
---
Jade rabbit. As a main hung jury d1 user, that exotic first comes to mind in how strong it is, then polaris/mida etc etc
---
I just finished watching it. That scene was lit
---
How long have ya been around for D2?
---
I‚Äôll join. 
---
Yesterday I finally bound one of my emotes to my mouse key. Never did something so sweaty, but it's so overpowered. They should really disable emotes in Crucible
---
I have and I don‚Äôt even use lol
---
Embrace downvotes
---
I had no idea that's what we looked like...
---
I probably wouldn‚Äôt play pvp again just to keep that
---
I know how it works thanks

*Closely looks at Hunter*
---
Is this a new species of ape?
---
Are they notes from their parents?
---
We got to remember that getting forsaken exotics is so hard that Xur can‚Äôt get them either
---
Easy class to play, change my mind
---
I‚Äôm missing Ursa Furiosa on my titan, I want it so bad
---
Yeah unfortunately I have had a streak of duplicates and it‚Äôs been like 10-12 hours of gameplay in between exotic drops for me. Been doing exactly this for 2 weeks and I‚Äôve not been lucky at all. Only good thing I‚Äôve gotten in the past couple weeks is a kill clip blast furnace... but it has air assault.
---
It's like in a movie where a guy punches the main dude, doesn't work, then the main dude punches him out of the room. 
---
I want that ring
---
I am wondering the same on how to skip the long drawn out cut scene. I can sum up the story without even playing this game yet. My character is the Mary Sue chosen one, just let me play the game sooner.
---
Nice
---
I wouldn't know what this is like. Not a problem if you don't play on the TV. 
---
Thanks‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Yeah this and the "Bank those motes!" and the blueberry runs around with 14 motes trying to make it an even 15 are why 4 stacks are mandatory. :p
---
Only Titans know of the mind numbing repetition of dying trying to shoulder bashes respawning and trying again
---
I should have listened
---
I feel bad every time I use it, there's funner exotics, just that OEM gives so much utility in Crucible which makes it an easy choice to most people
---
Let the controversy beginüòÇ
---
The main white and blue gate is like the one from plains of eidolon 
---
Chill, lemme rest my c o c k on your lips.
---
If only they‚Äôd just add random perk rolls to all guns. Boom, diverse as fuck 
---
Update. Confirming that it ONLY happens during story missions. Even happens during the subclass missions. Though strangely it doesn't seem to happen during the Mars mission. At least the first one anyway since I'm too low level to do it successfully.
---
The 2 on Mercury are a blast to chill with, until some random ass comes by and hits them.  
---
To complete the sweats build you gotta run 2 ordinance and 3 Paragon mods.
---
I got a level 330, just done the main quest line.   
---
First of all, no. I play on PC, made my own pc, and you ain‚Äôt getting shit for $1200. (CAD, that‚Äôs the price for both including a year of plus) On top of that, a Plus gives you free games, in game packs (similar to twitch) and PS4 exclusives (not just including games, but in game content as well) PCs last 3 years before they start slowing down, develop viruses, etc. While you may have a higher frame rate, it doesn‚Äôt mean much in the grand scheme of things because it really isn‚Äôt all that noticeable above 60 FPS. 
---
All praise Lord Calus, and may he shade our gear for seasons to come.
---
No, learn to play against it and improve then earn the gun yourself. (Not a Luna owner) 
---
I play teams with NF and Luna sometimes and still manage maining a snipe and a sidearm. There are plenty of other combinations that work also, bow+sidearm/HC, aggressive burst pulses, high flinch weapons so high impact and explosive rounds here. Learn what works, git gud and quit complaining. üëå
---
So you‚Äôre saying I‚Äôm ALWAYS the 5th attempt xP =(
---
Dont even have to damage the big guy lol. Just fight off the adds.
---
Better than I could have done. Have an upvote. 
---
Thanks I just spit coffee all over my work computer.
---
Pleiades Corrector has a similar feels, but the sound is different.
---
Personally, I find Whisper *way* harder solo than Shattered Throne. They are both possible to do solo, but I have never been able to do Whisper with less than a full team of 3.

It looks great imo, even the hands, my only tip would be that he looks kind of ridiculous holding the hammer by the bottom and not the middle of the grip.  But that‚Äôs my only concern.

Correct! Curated weapons drop when you forge the matching powerful frame.

So far, how it's worked is that all powerful gear is still powerful in the next season.

I don't get why everyone tried to bust out every game in a couple of weeks though. Space it out a bit, even doing the weekly 3 would have got it for you by now if you started at the beginning with no burnout.

Pretty much, yeah. It's Whisper, but does less damage, uses regular ammo and goes boom once in a while

Most of the stuff you can do solo. Since you enjoyed it as you said I would say it is worth to buy the DLCs.
---
There is matchmaking just not for there where you really need it (the hardest stuff - raids, nightfalls). For main story there is also no matchmaking but you can always invite or join your friends/clan mates.
---
Yo where do I check this 
---
How do you replay the story missions?  I've been done with them for a while.
---
I had a blue mission from the Mercury story line.  Also have another one called The Corrupted on Dreaming city.
---
I keep thinking the radio thingy will be mistaken as my head in quick engagements, so I use that cloak mostly for PvP. I don't think it works well for my intended purposes, but still, I try.
---
There's also a legendary version of Polaris Lance that's given to you called BrayTech RWP Mk.ll with a masterwork that gives it an extra shot in the mag. (You get the Masterworked version after the 3rd step if I remember right.)  
---

---
It doesn't have Dragonfly, but it still gets Triple Tap along with Tactical Mag for a total of 13 shots. (14 on the masterworked version.)  
---
It's not quite the same since it's a High-Impact Scout and not a Lightweight Scout, but it's pretty much the closest thing we get to it, also one of the few Y1 legendaries I'd say is still worth using.

 Sorry you watch so much porn you got viruses. But, for others, PC is way better value than PS4. Even if you add game pricing and building your own computer. And no it doesn't cost $1200 just to build a PC. A $400 build can play graphic heavy games like the Witcher, Far Cry 5, Destiny 2, and Battlefield 5. Also, we get soooo many sales on Steam and Origin I can guarantee you'll save more money than an average console player. You can even play on any controller, Xbox or PlayStation. Therefore, you must be smoking crack to say that PS4 is a better value. Maybe, you should check actual facts before you start talking.

Did they have crown icons? Those are quests that lead to exotic items. 
---
To replay story missions, go to the vanguard icon on the director. 
---
Isn't the bergusia even worst though? When you suck at raid you can't even get it for god sake!
---
You don't need the helm to do that. Just run top tree 
---
Yeap, I guess it‚Äôs necessary to include instructions like that, cause some people actually don‚Äôt know that they can shoot through the banner shield. Was doing NF and, by Traveler, this hunter kid kept on peaking out to shoot enemies and going back behind me. I moved a little to the right, thought maybe there was some obstacle or smthg, but nope. He kept running in and out. Mind blown. I‚Äôm out. Back to hammers.

Foetracer is like a downgraded effect of one part of OEM
---
You don't actually lose points. But once you reach legend, you don't get any points for a loss and it takes about 20 wins to get through legend. 
---
Took me about 2 months to get the last drop I needed as well haha don't give up on other titles too! I almost quit destiny for awhile from trying to get Rivensbane but finally got it on my 45th raid haha (I know others have been so lucky)
---
The forge activities have matchmaking and most of the quest steps are soloable, so yeah. It‚Äôs been worth it for me.
---
Old guard D1 player came back to and picked up everything for D2 just like 2 weeks before TLW quest dropped. Greatly enjoying my experience as a solo player and I‚Äôm up to like almost 640 light 
---
Nice! Petra‚Äôs Run is all I need and my team is going for it tonight. What was your strat to prevent guitar? 
---
I also have Blacksmith done and I just need the ship and sparrow for Dredgen and we‚Äôre approaching a full curse week :)
---
I stopped dawning cookie production at 420...  I thought that just as fitting as this one here.  However, as a Y1 player, my CD emblem already had well over 200 on it at the start of this year's event (sad face).

I was doing EP earlier with a WoR Warlock, they‚Äôd pop ult, I‚Äôd set down my barricade with like six of us in the Well, then pop my ult to block the Ogre‚Äôs attacks, and poof! Everyone decided to leave our little camp for some reason? Come on guys, draw the aggro to the shield, I make orbs, then we all have our ults back!

No assmir

I mean yeah I feel ya. But that doesn‚Äôt mean you just give up. You keep trying and trying through these services until you find people you like and add them. Continue the cycle. You may find a really good dude and then he might have a much of other good dudes he‚Äôs friends with and there you go you have a group. Just keep trying. Trust me I been there in your shoes. You‚Äôll find people I promise. I would never of found some of these great people to do stuff with if I never would of tried and put the effort in. You WILL find people it‚Äôs just a matter of time. Seriously. It‚Äôll be worth it. Majority of all these famous clans on destiny all started through lfg‚Äôs. That‚Äôs how they all met. You think majority of players who play with groups started by being friends IRL? Because they didn‚Äôt lol they all met online. Just don‚Äôt give up dude it‚Äôll be worth it in the end. You‚Äôll make some connections. What platform are you on?

The Machina Dei 4 reminded me of it. Used it a lot in CoO.
---
Find me something considered a no scope that is more than a single shot kill, things like urban dictionary define it as a single shot, it even defines doing it to somebody next to you takes little to no skill
---
nah....  Etch-A-Sketch...  lull...
---
If your talking about the radiant seeds, there‚Äôs a lost sector on mars where you can skip straight to the end and the boss drops 10 at a time, takes about 6 minutes total 
---
Buy it play it have fun with it.
---
We tried not having any tracking emblems and started it quickly. We normally have bad luck with the guitar error but got lucky I think. Weirdly enough we had the most deaths on kalli and in-between her and shuro. Once we got past shuro we did it first try haha. Congrats on blacksmith! I haven't even attempted that one to be honest as I'm the only one who routinely gets through the sparrow race. Dredgen was my first and the meatball spawn rate is so much better now haha
---
Thanks
---
Lemon poison never runs out boom.
---
For all intensive purposes
---
The other light makes her look like a Vex.
---
:(

The ornament is called Positive Infinity and I got it from recovering 35 data things on Mars. You gotta find and shoot the glowing signals with the corresponding element it shows. There is a guide on where to find them. The ornament was a random drop, I think I was in the Dreaming City.
---
I‚Äôm a solo player. It‚Äôs been great so far. For multiplayer activities like raids you can always use the destiny companion app for Looking for Group section
---
Same. I'm going to be getting on Xbox here in an hour or so to run a few and hopefully have it drop. If you're on XB and wanna run, let me know!
