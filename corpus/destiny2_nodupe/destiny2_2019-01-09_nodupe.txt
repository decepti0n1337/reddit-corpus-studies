The best way to do this is to bank at 9, or if you go over, go for an ogre.

---
Pleaseee bring back doubles. 
---
Hell even think about that time cayde made friends. He showed up to some fallen having a left for dead horde moment against the hive and he just fucking cleared half of the hive out while only one fallen survived
---
If I get a friend request from the other team it‚Äôs so they can talk shit to me. 
---
i can't even do the damn codes because i dismantle weapons if they aren't god rolls and you cant even reaquire the black armory guns you need from collections.  thanks bungie , but im not grinding forges again to get those guns back. 
---
I‚Äôm not hating but if they put the time into the dlc that they did with these weapon frame steps the annual pass might have been worth it.
---
Idk honestly I think it's a glitch 
---
I run this mission solo, so if anyone wants a free whisper, just message me when the blights are up and i will be more than happy to carry you through it. I love the mission.
---
The Last Word
---
Well like this is a forge, its not a ‚Äúraid‚Äù or a dungeon. I could understand if this was to unlock some super hard end game content and even then id probably still be frustrated. But this is the final forge. Something that takes under 5-10 mins to do a run . And probably finishes a exotic quest. I just wana play some content on the day it releases instead of standing in 1 room and trying over and over to enter codes. Is it really so much to ask? 
---
Honestly I feel you man. All the work you have to put in for a few minute horde battle and getting shit weapon frame drops. I started playing other games just had to take a step back from destiny. I‚Äôm sure the good dlc will drop right after the annual pass is up.
---
Look it up, i'm not doing this dumb sht with you.

Now this is advanced Gay Baby Jail.

Shoutouts to SimpleFlips
---
I have no idea what the cyphers are, can you link me an explanation video
---
These codes have been used in unlocking things since the first forge and the guns have been essential for it. Why is it bungie's fault you lack sense that it would stay relevant?
---
Oh Crota, once my favorite solo content in the game. Actually managed to do it with my hunter, but I honestly spent way too much time in that. Almost every week of D1 year one I also tried to solo every nightfall. I just liked the extra challenge it brought, maybe it has something do with that I am a huge fan of "Soulsborne" series.
---
Yeah, and then cayde üò™
---
Lmao!!
---
I swear most of my deaths as a Warlock was me failing to do a jump.
---
Nobody ever asks "how's Niobe?" :(
---
Idk why. Elitism maybe. Also, remember, wow removed attunements years ago because people bitched 
---
I just like this game so much been a fan since d1 day 1. Bought ever single dlc content drop they have had. Im not against time gating content at least some of its ok but when they lock everyones content behind some community puzzle it just gets frustrating for people who don‚Äôt have all day every day to play. 
---
Warlocks are sekrit Op in 3.5. That afforementioned combo is Chain Eldritch Blast and Sundering Blast. Chain Blast lets you hit a number of targets within 15ft. Sundering Blast targets gear worn by someone. 
---
The average sword only has 15-25hp and 5-10 hardness. A cloak only has 20hp. Rings are 10, etc. 
---
By the time you have access to Chain Blast, you're level 11.
---
It do
---
Tie the shaders in with that as well 
---
So much better
---
Yeah I work 10 hour days so it‚Äôs hard I always have to play catch up and I miss a lot of stuff. I didn‚Äôt even get to get thunderlord because I had to work out of state at the time of the event. Feelsbadman.
---
https://youtu.be/ualG-M3z8x0
---
Im with you there, i wasn‚Äôt around for thunderlord. I miss quite a bit of stuff too which is fine most of the time. I think it would have been alot better if bungie would have said..... the new forge unlocks after you clear niobe labs puzzles and challenges. Etc. something so we all knew there was a chance we wouldnt get to play this content today. Who knows these puzzles may not get solved until morning, look at last wish raid for example. 
---
Horror‚Äôs lease from The Corrupted. It‚Äôs required for cursebreaker
---
Bungie has been putting content behind community completions since Forsaken dropped. If you took off of work to play a single new forge you might want to get your priorities straight.
---
Eh. I disagree. At least D1 allowed us to mix and match abilities freely.
---
Idk I just started back up and play on US and also have no one to play with lol
---
The Niobe labs puzzle will always be there for people to complete. Bungie has confirmed it will not disappear once someone solves it. 
---
Time for Anthem 
---
Phalanxes die easy for me. It's the other ones (can't remember their name) that give me fits
---
I think everyone neglects the fact that the heroic adventure there accounts for 35% of the Flashpoint. Do one, PE, the Heroic Adventure, then come back at that reset and finish it off.
---
Help me get MountainTop lol. I'm a GL nut
---
I do think it's way better. My experience has been that a lot of my friends who played destiny 1 didn't think it had a lot of depth though it was fun, so they stopped playing once dlcs basically made all their items obsolete. So now that d2, a much better game, is out, they think it's basically the same, so they either dont play it or havent bought it, which is really unfortunate for me in a game that emphasizes teamwork so much.
---
My only real problem with d2 is that some of the forsaken armors have been a bit lackluster and I wish theyd bring back more items from d1. Playing as a hunter almost exclusively, I can without a doubt say that the cloaks for forsaken have been mostly pretty trash. I'd also like more d1 exotics, like thorn and last word. But the gameplay, story, and amount of content have all improved since d1 and that is a fact.
---
I really like it in PVP because it doesn‚Äôt require much aiming. Won‚Äôt hold up in competitive though 
---
This can help for those uninformed

It‚Äôs so easy to counter.

D2 broke my heart so bad I can never forgive it, as much as i want to 
---
If you are used to going for precision, C+1 will have you puking. If you are a spray and prayer, kill is a kill i dont care if it takes slightly longer, C+1 is heaven.
---
C+1 also has a very weird quirk where you do less dmg at point blank so you have to find the sweet range. Also it melts adds with big heads like knights,captains,centurion,ogre etc.
---
I got D2 free on ps+ hand still haven't played it. 
---
ive been farming for a feeding frenzy rampage roll. ive gotten 8 feeding frenzy kill clip rolls. Feelsbadman!
---
Yea I have Osiris but not forsaken. It‚Äôs super frustrating because I randomly get high gear, but when I equip it, all other rewards seem to stop on 313. But if I equip all gear that is 313 and say, play in the crucible, I end up getting rewards that are 314 or 315.  I don‚Äôt own forsaken, but when I got engrams saying they were from forsaken, it boosted me up to 319. But legendary engrams are now stuck at 314 light and the legendary engrams as winning rewards from the crucible (from challenges like completing 5 games to get forsaken engram) are actual higher light drops at 321

Datto, Gladd, and Tearex are trying to figure out the final code for niobe labs to unlock the door and Bergusia forge.

Why does no one even acknowledge it after the war ends?

Should be anything that drops "Powerful Gear" as a reward, if those specific bounties/challenges are not dropping at higher than your LL, then you should probably try to contact bungie wish some evidence of the bug to try to get it resolved.
---
Just make sure that under reward it says Powerful Gear for whatever you are doing.
---
That really sucks if you're stuck man, I hope you get it worked out soon!
---
That sounds like a fun roll. Right up there with Outlaw/Kill Clip.
---
x4

Completely understandable. There's a lot of content which is great, but it can also leave people feeling very overwhelmed especially if they're just starting to get into everything now

Currently you cannot get any of those catalysts. Faction rallies were temporarily removed from the game due to bad player feedback. They will be back at some point in a reworked form, but there is no word on when or how they will change. 
---
Faction rallies used to be a one week event that happened every now and then, similar to Iron Banner. There was a notification about it when you logged in, so you didn't miss it. You could pledge to one faction per character per faction rally, so if you only had one character you'd have to do 3 faction rallies to get things from each faction. If you had three characters, you could pledge each character to one faction within one single faction rally event. They gave unique guns and shaders, plus ornaments for armor (the armor was a reskinned version of pre-existing armor).
---
Honestly, I always think it's better to run the lost sector near Ana, it's much faster and it works well.
---
Yeah I have been getting ten paces so much. 
---
How long does the curse take each time? Like how long will it take to get all 11 stories?
---
But for only a single stem. I run it with the 3rd (kill enemies) patrol running so I get two out of the effort but it's those juicy PEs with double stems that I really want.
---
I see, thanks. So, I just won't worry about it. Weird I can't get the catalyst though.

What's the trick to get the ikelos shotgun.  I have 55 EP completions with the hand cannon equipped and still nothing?..like seriously bungo wtf!? 
---
Well I've been on a month hiatus so I'm still 618 but I would be willing to do raids if you needed someone for a team
---
Pretty sure you need it. Just tried hitting only Sedia with charged balls (cabals on elevator died from non charged relics and before hitting Sedia with charged ball we cleared all ads in area), and it didn't work. So I think it's either bugged or we're still missing something
---
Then people be like: We need 1, KNOW WHAT TO DO OR YOU WILL BE KICKED. Don‚Äôt be toxic *gets kicked*
---
I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre smoking either, ‚Äúthey‚Äù? Lol
---
I know what the bow is like in PvP, this is a humour post, clearly not my comment in the screenshot but I found it funny so I posted here, stop getting all defensive over your precious bow ffs
---
What‚Äôs his deal with always being hungry?
---
Hmmmmmmm 
---
But wait he‚Äôs Whisper of the Worm now isn‚Äôt he?
---
What the fuck is the strategy on this? I can't get the timing of the javelin and his attacks to line up in any way.
---
There‚Äôs no escape
---
Alright, alright, alright. Scorn flakes on the field. Get some vex milk.
---
I don‚Äôt think using a console game that was ported to pc is a very accurate metric, some people might have just not wanted to buy it twice, or can‚Äôt afford it.
---
Yeah I was the only new person and i only got caught 1. Fuckin. Time. I need a new fireteam. 
---
you gotta pre-charge javelin before he is going to breath fire and land a shot preferebly in his crit spot and than do it again on the second breath, after that cast will be interrupted and that's gonna be your "one"
---
Yeah, that's what I tried too but no luck. All the information I've found online is people saying it's bugged and I've yet to see anyone with the Triumph completed so I guess that's how it is.
---
I would argue that a Sun Breaker Titan's choice between Fire-Forged and Siegebreaker are really underwhelming. Aggressor/ Protector/ Commander is slightly better but the main draw is the different supers and "Ward of Dawn" is a situational pick at best. 
---
Warlocks Dawnblade attunement of sky is pretty bad, I can't say for certain as I'm not a warlock player but on paper this doesn't seem like a better option than the other 2 trees in most scenarios. 
---
Arcstrider hunters are choosing between dodging more, punching more, or sliding. The other hunter subclasses seem to offer way more choices for playstyle. Example: dual blades, tether, multi arrow. 6 shot golden gun, 3 shot with bonus for precision hits, or blade barrage. 
---
Good grief! Must be a really tiny bit. I'm guess it has the weird Darkness-crittee he uses to create his Taken and other stuff in it?
---
"RNG is random, so let's call it broken" perfect logic right there
---
Breakfast at the drill
---
I tried night mode and it didn't feel right
---
Well since they're the one invading i'll take malfeasance,  damage bonus
---
The theory right now is that the drifter has his own ascendant throne realm like the hive and that's where he keeps everything.
---
&gt; Gotta eat those ~~motes~~ oats
---
Are you running 3 characters through their weekly milestones? Run 1 and it‚Äôll be slow, run 3 for 2 weeks and you‚Äôll be close to 640
---
Just take Queenbreaker man, it's a guaranteed headshot
---
So I've heard, which makes sense since the swirly schtuff in the Mote Banks looks a *lot* like a canned portal to the Ascendant Plane. Plus there's whatever the hell that thing behind him in the transmat room is.
---
OEM especially and shard of galanor i hope they get nerf to the group, they destroy pvp
---
Literally took the first raid team to complete just the newest raid almost a full day straight, next time dis a game get your facts right first please.
---
Panotes was fucking sick, but his fight needed to be re thought,
---
Op luck is broken
---
It‚Äôs at primeevil slayer 8. Any shoulder and I‚Äôd think they were hitting it with a water pistol 
---
I'd pay for this
---
We couldn't kill the boss
---
Well then you are out of luck. Don‚Äôt think anyone except Bungie can help :/
---
Extinguish.
---
Nope. Datto have been doing it the whole night, hes been stuck on Level 6 for a long time now.
---
Am european, sadly they haven't finished it yet. Still stuck on Level 6
---
If you play ps4 message me I‚Äôm in japan and always looking to play with others. 
---
Damn... my plan was flawed! Still had a good nights sleep tho
---
This the worst and boring thing I‚Äôve seen in destiny who thought this was a good idea spending 20 hour straight shooting symbols are you kidding
---
You need to check your facts. T1Gigz beat scourge of the past in 1 hour and 45 minutes after release.
---
I didn't, lol. Stayed up a bit too late to watch them attempt one more time. But then i realized it wasn't worth it the sleep deprevation the next day
---
duke's a godroll. for devils, you'd want outlaw kill clip, and some range on that too. hopefully from accurized rounds and range masterwork.
---
Hehe, I actually made a design for a Sorlock recently. I didn't realise that they were actually a thing.
---
&gt;No content
---
@
---
&gt;An actually hard and interesting puzzle to solve
---
&gt;Bitching about no content
---
That's what I'm saying why should I have to wait on others to get to content I paid for. Like WTF bungie.
---
Could you point me in the right direction? All the YouTube videos I'm finding are not working
---
I‚Äôm obviously not. Why would I be referring to Last Wish?
---
I remember one of the week 3 chest is literally next to muginn, the vendor that trades you queensfoil for baryon bough in harbingera seclude. Northwest corner of map. You can check there to confirm.
---
Yea just trying to clarify
---
Yeah. And OP was clearly talking about SOTP.
---
The next part of Black Armory, presumably the 4th forge. It has to be unlocked by a team before becoming globally available and nobody has figured it out yet.
---
This is the best thing Bungie has put out lately 
---
You can try lowlidev's destiny map. It lists all chest locations and short 15 sec youtube videos on how to get there for each one. Just google lowlidev destiny map.
---
I feel you man, I can‚Äôt get the money to buy it yet lol. That‚Äôs pretty much what my log looks like except it‚Äôs all tangled shore, definitely my new favorite area
---
It's basically another thing to do instead of just shooting stuff. So that's cool.
---
It's not so cool that you need a team of people to even try to solve the puzzle (or at least parts of it). There are many solo players that have nothing to do until some team solves the puzzle and opens the forge for everyone.
---
That's kind of childish of you to be honest. I bet you don't even have the other puzzles done or the beacons or the keys for the exotic chest. The black armory has been a giant puzzle from the start. Furthermore bungie already said they were trying a different way to push out dlc. You want everything day one so you can beat it by day 2 and then complain til jokers wild comes out? Just solve the damn puzzle on your own or find a tutorial like everyone else and then play what you paid for 
---
No prob man 
---
If its too cluttered, click on the ? on the bottom left and turn off everything except treasure chest.
---
Im sick of these post from casual players. Just wait until the weekend while the real destiny community figures this out for you. 
---
Yeah man that's totally understandable, especially with how barebones the game was at launch. 
---
Except it is the other way around
---
The raid is a flop too. 
---
Maybe they will be a few minutes late?
---
Once someone figures it out it will be open for all.  You shouldn't have to go through this. 
---
TL:DR Guy likes game and community. Please updoot.
---
This is what is making me upset.  Bungie says you can do this solo.  But you can't.  I love these kinds of puzzles like the outbreak prime from destiny 1. 
---
Hey bro I have every exotic, Luna's howl, I put in 1500 hours since Osiris. I'm not casual. I just want to be able to keep playing and not hit a wall that stops be from playing for days. 
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ can‚Äôt take you serious honestly, go contemplate life and why you‚Äôre wasting oxygen and cut it, thanks.
---
Do the AC-130. Skyburners Oath, Lion Ramparts and Mountaintop
---
lmao im dying
---
It means u think it's something good but turns out to be something bad
---
If the Mindbender can have one, a renegade Guardian can have one.
---
Got oath keepers for resetting my crucible rank, I don't even like bows
---
I did wave 1 and 2, went to sleep, now I'm in school, this better be solved when I get home.
---
The mad lad did it again.
---
Oooh, i see. I just don‚Äôt have the latest dlc so yeah, I‚Äôm not updated on it
---
I VERY second this.
---
I did the same thing. Loaded up and saw that I couldn't play the content. Not really interested in the same milestones just to get dupe exotics instead of the ones I need. Turned it off and went and played Warframe (just started 2 days ago).
---
So it means exactly what I said. So that means Niaboe Labs have been beat and the rewards weren't worth the effort. Right? 
---
I assume you mean Le Monarque? I'm not too keen on bows, and they wouldn't benefit from Scatter Targetting. I will probably switch to Hammerhead if I ever finish the requirements for Mountaintop, until then I'll probably keep The Colony unless I get a god-roll Hammerhead.   
---
If I do switch to Hammerhead was thinking of replacing the shotgun with Telesto but then I'd "need" to get the Catalyst for that one too. 
---
Izanami be like
---
Idk but yeah u probably know more about it so yeah
---
You should add me on Warframe
---
Lmao. "You're done" jesus christ you're a little douche. If you're that dumb you get hit by a move that's telegraphed af, then you're the bad one. And no, played a dozen crucible games today, saw maybe one nova warp, meanwhile every single hunter runs blades and theres 2-3 per lobby. You can just jump out of the way of nova and it's useless. Blades makes them 3x your speed and they can jump and kill you easily. No argument. You're done. 
---
They‚Äôre helping!? They‚Äôre the only ones crazy enough to think doing it is actually worth the time lol
---
What do you mean you couldnt? Does that mean you actually physically cant due to glitches or network problems? Or you didnt because the other team killed it first
---
?
---
Haha I'm on PS4. Just unlocked Cera today and finishing the last part for my Rhino frame so I will start the 72hour build in the morning.
---
‚ÄúPlayed a dozen crucible games today‚Äù was actually wandering around the tangled shore with blue weapons on. Sure kid, sure. If you get destroyed by spectral then good. Trash gets trashed have fun in Brave II. 
---
The armour has random rolls
---
It is and I feel your pain mate
---
Wait is there even a tiny chance of him getting it first? Doesn't he just let others do the discovering and then rush to put up a ten minute video with an eight minute intro? 
---
What the fuck even is your title my dude
---
I think OP is just saying dont expect a good reward.
---
It makes me cry
---
Obviously a blade barrage
---
Sleeper puts this thing to complete shame. 
---
This was the warmind gun for people who cant appreciate nice well built spartan lasers. 
---
Alright, alright, alright, a perfectly balanced breakfast on the field
---
I find that the Main Ingredient goes well with everything. Especially with rampage roll. 
---
How so?
---
I'm pretty sure that a standard DnD Warlock would get eye cancer if you cast Dawnblade in his vicinity.
---
I swear they made it hard to the sake of it being hard not for it to be fun not for it to be challenging it's just stupid. I mean come on did they really have to make u repeat ALL the stuff every single time?
---
&gt;firebolt bade
---
Did you mean Daybreak or Firebolt grenades
---
Yet there are already numerous youtube guides about "unlocking" the last forge, which is amusing
---
Have you been trying to solve the puzzle on stream since release? How is it going? Keep me posted when you and the community figured it out.
---
Havent played for 2 weeks haha its 4am and I wont be back home til 7, every weekday... rip. At least I got to 650 the first week lmao
---
He‚Äôs got a punchable face imo/ he feels snarky and I think he‚Äôs way to full of himself, IMO 
---
Where do you get this gun may I ask? :^) 
---
You just called a 6 year old who carried HIMSELF through the raids trash. And said "I'll 1v1 your kid". No, you wont. I wouldnt ever let him play with trash like you. Hes never carried through any activites. He does his own positions. And his own call puts. 
---
I think you dont know me. Or in the least all the things I do for my kid that obviously your dad didnt do for you because you turned out to be a disrespectful whiny little shit  
---
"They can barely aim on pc" line you've met every 6 year old in the entire world. Lmao my kid is super important. Many times I put down destiny today to do anything and everything he asks and wants to do. 
---
I'd 1 v 1 in real life. But that would be too painfully quick to barely enjoy. I bet you carry a what? Nerf 6 shot? Lmao tlak shit about my kid again. I got 16 reasons next to me why you wont do it again üôÑ
---
What are those circumstances exactly
---
TF2 in 2019 , I guess yos
---
That‚Äôs THE god roll on those boots. Nice one!
---
Yeah it's always to use it then seeing people sitting with you. 
---
To be honest the black armory season has been completely disappointing to me. All it added was stupid grind (I forged +50 weapons and not even one had a damage perk... no kill clip... no rampage... nothing.) This season is unrewarding... boring... devoid of content. Everything that made Forsaken a great DLC is missing right now and if this is the course Bungie is heading to, I will be off to new games.
---
I feel freed tbh destiny was getting too needy and I was getting burnt out and annoyed
---
Midnight coup is my go to, slightly worse fatebringer will always hold a place.
---
Alright alright alright...thx. ;-)
---
Players- WR WANT HARDER END GAME CONTENT!!! 
---
Bungie- Alrighty then, try these forges and this crazy new unlock puzzle. 
---
Players day 1 of BA- OMG it's too hard and I have to grind just to do forget I cant believe the outrage and madness. I asked for a harder game. Not a harder game!!!! 
---
Players today- ARE YOU KIDDING ME!? I cant play my content! (As they continue to forge stuff for the weekly, in the other 3 forges which in fact that same content lol) They shouldnt put it behind a door for 1 team to unlock and for me to have to wait for them to do it!!! 
---
You right. They could have just made everyone do it, suffer through it, and have to do it just to open the damn thing up knowing full well plenty of people would struggle for wwwaaayyyy longer than a day. 
---
Anyone can stream. And anyone with a decently sharp mind and some good high level buddies can make it happen and be a new worlds first group in a way.  instead,  the crying, the complaining, the hating. Want immediately available content and to not have to get your power and light up for newly added content? 
---
Plenty of shooters that can help you out. Otherwise, I only have two questions if you dont want to gravitate to less fun, less exciting, and less engaging games right now, why are you even playing and here if you are so displeased? And why do you have to share that disappointment and negativity in a place where theres mad love for it? 
---
Instead of complaining turn on broadcast. And get in there and do something. 
---
Uh a no thanky
---
Me all the time 
---
breakneck&gt;Midnight Coup, IMO
---
You could only get them with The Dawning event, i'm sure they're gonna add new ones though
---
That doesn't explain his silence throughout all Black Armory content.
---
I'm always happy to let people know here or in public if need be that I always keep 16 reasons on me for them to rethink their actions. Lmao 
---
Y'all don't like it for pve? I think the DPS alone is worth it in bosses imo.
---
that destiny player needs an 8 year old arm.
---
Perhaps just another symptom of the torture that is the RNG then. 
---
Have you played any raids?
---
The desperate to be first streamers that are still going have resorted to blasting their chats for copy pasta of the same ideas over and over. Cool, get pissed at the people most likely paying your ‚Äúsalary‚Äù. Happy to see these are the people Bungie has been catering the game to. 
---
Haven't played in 4 months.  
---
Forsaken just hasn't given me the excitement to finish it yet :/
---
Everyone wanted a challenge, bungie gave them one. Now they want hints from the devs to solve it because it's too hard. Too funny.
---
destinylfg.net
---
I find the entire thing ridiculous. Some of us dont set around for hours on end trying to solve some pointless puzzle in a video game that doesnt need to be there in the first place. I dont pay for products to set around and wait for OTHER PEOPLE to unlock things in order for me to play it.
---
I do wonder why both cod and destiny went toward team shooting at the same time. It is a boring mechanic. Cod became fps king by allowing solo players to excel. Part of me thinks is some communalist politics kind of bullshit but I know that sounds crazy.
---
Oh I way that‚Äôs cool I‚Äôll try it thank you!
---
I haven't ever watched him on Twitch. I've just seen his Youtube videos. I'm not used to seeing him this frustrated. 
---
The raids just a matter of your fireteam and getting that boss in the right area, don't stress yourself out if you can't do it the first time or first few, I think I ended up trying 3-5 times the first or second week it was out and as of last night I think I have 9-10 clears? 
---
Whisper is preferred for the end as well as well-locks but other then that it's a run what you're comfortable with raid, honestly in the raids I've done for scourge I've had
---
 someone use Darci cause they didn't have whisper (turned out good actually so that's a second option)
---
Someone who didn't exactly know what to do multiple times( just took  a few tries and ended up having one four phase completion)
---
The longest part of the raid being the sparrow race as sad as that is (was going for chest )
---
Oh and my personal favorite, someone who put up an LFG died 3 times out of the 6 you can revive then get pissed and say F-ck LFG's then proceed to kick half the fireteam (which where the top 4 people, 1 guy who wasn't kicked was 3rd I believe ) 
---
Feel free to join the Wee Wee Stranglers. We're a small 3 man clan LOL. 
---
I believe the falloff is the same but it's the extra damage it gives due to the explosion that makes it seem as if there's less falloff if that makes sense and I'm kinda glad to hear I'm not the only one üòÇ, bungie has acknowledged it's an issue and said they were looking into it so let's hope it gets fixed soon 
---
I also believe that explosive payload gives a flinch mechanic like hi-cal rounds do if I remember correctly
---
Idk what everybody is talking about, all I know is that Niobe is out, that's it, is it hard or something? 
---
You don't have to play through the whole story at the start. You can just play the story mission or two whenever you feel like playing it. Yes you can access your vault from all characters on your account.
---
My feelings exactly
---
The exotic quests in this game are great. I had a lot of fun getting the Mars exotics and whisper. 
---
Do it! It goes fast. You can boost up then you just gotta farm to lv 50 then you can carry weapons over from your normal character then the speed of light increase will really go faster. You can‚Äôt share armor between the classes though. 
---
I managed to do that in 5 minutes instead of runnig everywhere trying to find a minotaur to spawn.
---
This probably work on other places and mobs aswell, but i felt like this spot was simply the best, you litterally just have to sit where i was, kill the things and wait 5seconds between respawns :).
---
Hope that will help \^\^
---
One for each level of the curses strength - so three variations in total.
---
Just found this out myself a few weeks ago
---
They alienated literally truck loads full when they turned it from a grinding hard mission in some cases based game to one full of frills and lace and free exotics as far as the eye could see. So so many hard core players, streamers and just in general people who tried to make MORE time to play D2, ended up empty and disappointed because they catered the game the other way . They KNOW their real fans will come in the bad, and slay in the best times like it is now. As someone who plays a good amount and streams from time to time. Casuals and their whiny "its top hard and we want the rarest stuff easy" had their turn. It hurt bungie and density bad. They brought it back into a place where it's more like it used to be, and lots are flocking back. 
---
Them catering to a slim group of people almost screwed them and ruined the amount of folks I could find to do most activites. Like, you dont toss your loyal fans aside. And then build your game for 9-5s.  With game streaming and all that how it is now, I'm not gonna feel a little bad Bout how things are right now because jove where it was stuck for so long. 
---
&gt;Best form a fireteam of 4-5 
---
For anyone wondering what wizardry this requires, you have everyone *not* be in a fireteam, fast travel repeatedly to the same spot on Mars, and then when 2 people are placed in the same instance, everyone else joins them. You are more likely to be placed with people who are physically closer to you in the real world, so this is pretty fast if two or more people live near-ish one another. 
---
BB gun activate
---
saw that and was thinking the same thing, so I ordered a crossman vigilante pellet pistol, and I am going to try to make my own Ace :)
---
Reload every 30sec. 
---
Lose all Killclip's dmg bonus. 
---
My son hadnt gotten it recently. And my wife sometimes helps him get some of easier weekly done when hes at his moms and not here for a weekend. Eff of biased system. Be better off in family court with RNG damn near. They both are absolutley in love.  Told them long, gotta get them. They help immensely. Especially when its LAST GUARDIAN STANDING 
---
Honestly, I have no idea. I‚Äôm usually preoccupied with wiping out all the enemies. 
---
Nothing compared to the hidden shit in Battlefield
---
are green and explode. gotcha
---
I think the base game without DLC is not any better than at release (the only new thing is that nightfalls have a rare drop that is unique to each nightfall). I think Forsaken is the other half this game has always needed. It is a worthwhile purchase if you want to play this game for a long time. It comes with Curse of Osiris and Warmind, so just the one purchase of Forsaken is all that is necessary. 
---
well, the new buzzwords for game companies are "aspirational content" and "twitcheable content"  because it seems that some people likes to experience a game througth streams  (wich i don't understand, in that, at that point is not a game, is a movie) . 
---
I don't and i really hope that i am in the mayority so those things stop being done and fall in the obscurity they deserve.
---
This specific one is leading to a chest. Collect all 10 chest that are available during that week of the cycle and you can earn a Triumph. Thats it.
---
Same spot I went to. I‚Äôd get a bunch to drop there. Took no time at all.
---
To get year 1 (vanilla, Curse of Osiris, Warmind) exotics, do the Leviathan raid and go with someone who knows how to find the underbelly chests. These have a very high chance of giving you exotics. Also, buy from Xur. 
---
To get year 2 exotics, there is no other way but to play. Weekly challenges seem to have a slightly higher chance of dropping exotics, but that's about it. Everything has a minuscule chance. 
---
New content and literally no reason to play D2 this week. Oh well...other games to play until they figure it out.
---
Content we can completely skip. (a waste of development time)
---
I thought people were saying it was some old Norse text or something? That might have come from my scandanavian friend though, I don't quite recall.
---
Do you not know how range works? In destiny range is a cone and as you are rather away from your target the bullets will not travel in line to where you are aiming they will move away... guns with lower range miss even if you are aiming on your target. It is the gun that is why NF is better than Luna‚Äôs and no one uses lunas
---
Thanking streamers who get paid to play this and received 24+ hours of inflated view counts? Really makes you think.
---
To be fair, level 6 took way to long and if people tested their ideas themselves it would have saved at least 13 or so hours or something.
---
This is pretty much what happens with every developer for every game and every business on the face of the planet; people only piss and moan when there's something wrong and they never leave positive feedback.
---
Same could be said for your English teachers.
---
Yeah I feel like decent players at max level with the best gear should be able to complete anything in the game with some effort. This is just ridiculous.
---
I‚Äôm a Titan main and they‚Äôre very underwhelming 
---
How was the 6th step poorly designed? 
---
This is like Boner Jams ‚Äò03 for r/raidsecrets
---
me irl
---
can't even summon a sparrow. Garbage planet
---
I noticed that. Looks kinda cool though with the Scatterhorn cloak
---
On the other hand, my dad is the exact opposite. Despite my telling him otherwise, he instinctively thinks that reloading a partially full magazine will waste the ammo in it as though Drop Mag was on all weapons all the time.
---
OR, Make resonate stems a reward for clearing waves of EP
---
Kills while in your well don't count, but your well itself does hefty damage on activation. I levelled my really quick by going to mars, activating EP and popping super on top of a huge group of thralls
---
Dont give Activision any good damn ideas... I was at Blizzcon last year and they just kept fucking hammering on about "Lucio's" basically green Cheerios for the Overwatch character Lucio... It was cheesy as fuck and a obvious money grab
---
Nobody wants to bang their head against the wall for the day to unlock new content. Puzzles need to be activities on the side to be done for extra reward, not the main focus. I'm nkt mad at the difficulty of the puzzle, or even how long it's taking. I'm mad that I don't get to play the new content I was expecting.
---
There's some grey shader that completes the look, I forget which one it is.
---
I don't mind the repetition but I'm more displeased with how much more grind black armory forces you to do. This just screams laziness on developer's part. The grind is ridiculous, making you kill shit over and over for honestly little reward in gear. The pve grind is really making the game boring
---
That moment when you steal a meme from r/GlobalOffensive
---
You too can work on solving it. You don't have to rely on others to do the work! 
---
Check out /r/RaidSecrets right now basically all theyre talking about is Niobe and the steps. 
---
You can follow their progress and be right up there on step 7. Maybe you'll crack it!
---
Seriously. Couple of big streamers were stuck on step 6 for literally hours trying all this complicated stuff. Then this kid with 100 viewers tried one simple thing nobody else and got it. Within minutes 5000 people are watching him and his team asking how and offering tips on the next step. 
---
I get if you're all about solo play none if this may appeal.. but destiny 2 is an online multiplayer game. 
---
It's a lot more fun with people. 
---
Good thing I didn't take 2 vacation days to work on the new forge....   Oh wait I DID.   
---
Black armory is additional content on top of forsaken. It's not an expansion, and it's not a problem for me because I enjoy difficulty and seeing what patterns people come up with. And it's not alienating any of the community - again, it's in an accessible area that ANYONE can get to and attempt. Sure, following along is probably recommended but you don't need to. 
---
Well, any decent player at max level with the best gear should (and is) really be able to complete anything in the game with some effort.
---
Key word: Effort
---
&gt; My son hadnt gotten it recently. And my wife sometimes
---
Damn, what a family!
---
&gt;when hes at his moms and not here for a weekend
---
oh...:(
---
I would rather just have a hard dungeon
---
Currently stuck on the Corrupted mission step... Never had an opportunity to play with a fireteam
---
That‚Äôs now mafia works
---
This aged poorly
---
Nah you're full of it. Quit whining so much, you're allowed to play the new puzzle if you want and you just don't feel like it. Nobody elses problem if you just don't feel like it
---
I'm not that hard core of a player, so tbh I'm just playing the game like normal while the big guns solve the puzzle. New forge is gonna get unlocked one way or another, no need to bitch and moan.
---
Yea it‚Äôs pretty easy, raids are the funnest part of destiny imo, haven‚Äôt done SoTP yet tho
---
That just means they didn't decipher the puzzle right, and chose the long, tedious, "trial and error" method of solving.
---
OP should've made it into one image. I only saw it beacuse my image mouseover addon shows the entire gallery
---
Welp, ya got me. I've been trying to use guns that I think are more fun recently though, at least in PvE
---
They made it time consuming bc developers are out of ideas/funds for original and fun content. Seeing how grindy and repetitive black armory is, D2 has little to offer other than grinding. Pvp doesn't compare to other fps games
---
Compare with a MMORPG like black desert, new content means new zones, completely new classes, huge change in graphics, it's all free. But that game is pay to win, so I guess D2 doesn't have much of an incentive to put effort in new original content since once ppl pay for the game, the money ends there 
---
Actually, I think the only time I‚Äôve been that kinda guy who is completely new is during the leviathan raid.
---
I honestly dnt care if they completed the raid or not, as long as they have a general idea of how to do it.
---
Seriously, there are videos on how to do the raid, just watch it.
---
You know a dlc is bad if its just a little bit better than CoO
---
Just going to have to agree to disagree mate. I play games for the sense of accomplishment, getting better at it and overcoming challenges, which is why my first raid clears are always blind. Actually having the controller in my hands is why I play games. Not solving puzzles on the forums and Reddit for someone else to do the actual gaming for me.
---
If you had the time to watch "attempt after attempt last night" you couldve used that time to find people and try to do it yourself. Its neither yours nor bungies fault that (your words) you dont have the patience (i do believe you may have SOME time) to do THIS particular piece of content. Its just (wether we admit it or not) way more comfortable (and easy) to wait for someone else to do the job for us (and still complain).
---
No hate intended on my comment. Its just the way I see things. IMO, even tho im not doing anything to help those who are trying to solve this thing succeed, this is a very cool and unique thing to implement in games, opposed to the ever growing "lets make things really easy for everyone" meta.
---
But Niobe labs is unlocked....
---
Everybody that has the game is able to do all the content though....
---
So there's no middle ground here? It's either hand it to the player, or something like this on the exact opposite end of the spectrum? I don't mind working for anything... I've got hundreds and hundreds of hours invested into D2 and have never once complained about anything... XP throttling, poor exotic drop rate, etc.. not once have I even thought to complain. I'm just saying this is much more an exclusive trial, than an inclusive one. What's with all these try-hards on here?? It's a video game, eesh. 
---
I just cheesed through the headshots with the crimson. It made it so much easier
---
We never charged the relics in the elevator.  And cleared all the adds before throwing the charged relic at her both phases.
---
Meta in competitive, something interesting in quickplay.  
---
Don't hurt your team's rank!  
---
And spend 20 hours straight not unlocking it. They geared this to streamers and the hard core plain and simple giving no thought to the casual gamer.
---
Right, but my point is that there‚Äôs hundreds of solutions that would evoke that response. I think this hint led to way too many keys, and only one of the keys worked because Bungie chose it
---
As far as matchmaking activities, you got vanguard strikes, crucible, and gambit. For progress, your fastest route is weekly and daily milestones. Most of these can be completed using matchmaking, or solo in the case of flashpoint destinations, or dreaming city activities.
---
GOT EM 
---
Woosh. 
---
It‚Äôs not a difficult puzzle. 
---
It‚Äôs made arbitrarily difficult through poor design and/or withholding information. 
---
Anyone can go into Niobe labs. 
---
True but still. This isn‚Äôt supposed to take longer to complete than the last wish...
---
could‚Äôve been done with any other sniper :/
---
Sparrow and ship youll eventually get. TRUST ME. Its the ghost that doesnt exist
---
Let me have my fun :(
---
You‚Äôre on point with that. A lot of these guys have been saying that in the streams I‚Äôve been watching.
---
which at least for me and people I play with, have a higher chance to drop exotics than most things
---
Looks like we need to find little Richard 
---
But is it fun doing the same thing for 26 hours straight?
---
Finding something interesting that turns out to be powerful is the best thing! Never give up experimenting loadouts or doing unpopular things, you may find that they are much better than people give credit for
---
Do the main quest and forsaken and for your own benifit, do not come back and read ANYTHING here or on the web about Destiny 2 until... well you will know.
---
I gotta unlock Izanami still which I‚Äôm in the process of so no worries everyone, take your time figuring out the 4th so I can catch up!
---
and why shouldn't they be challenging and not just damage sinks
---
I got the Ghost not the others omegalul
---
Or they are people like me who work and have a life outside of D2. I still manage to put in about 6 hours or more a day so I'm far from a casual bungie made the right move with this not everyone likes puzzles. 
---
Except that once this puzzle is completed, nobody has to do it again.  This is not content for all.  Unfortunate that some people cannot sit for endless hours in front of a screen, because they might have actual lives, for zero actual reward.  Your argument is misplaced.
---
Awwww just shut up, sick of these posts.
---
I am too, I think the oracles was the right difficulty level for puzzles 
---
It's much easier on the eyes. Especially when you read a lot on your computer. 
---
I've set the monitors at my office desk at work to the lowest brightness settings, but being older LED monitors, they're still very bright. I usually have red eyes by the end of my shift lol.
---
You have now become one with the gun
---
Well, now we know, even if it's a suppression grenade, throw that shit at a nova warp and run like u gon blow up till u see a hit marker, then turn to finish them.
---
Kinda hate for hunters how we just gotta run if you don't wanna die unless ur super's full but still prolly have to be back pedaling if it's a shutdown super since the radius of the warp is ridiculous. 
---
Badlander is an energy shotgun
---
DRB is kinetic
---
The majority of people felt this was a bad design and Bungie relized their product was not what their customers wanted to they adapted.
---
I meant of 6 players. my b 
---
Or you don‚Äôt want to emerge from your mothers basement until you can say you beat it and unlocked the forge..
---
6 Gunsmith's Devotion gloves, 4 boots, 3 helmets, 2 bond, and only ONE chestplate.
---
2 Tempered Dynamos that sucked as well. Loaded Question is much better.
---
My Zenobia has a very nice blast radius...
---
I basically have 2 launchers with more or less equal stats, but one reloads much faster. That's the one with tracking module.
---
However Zenobia seems to lock much faster
---
You do if you're planning to go a bit further than a We Ran and still have ammo to fight. 
---
Okay so dont play. You literally just have to wait. Do something else and stop complaining or just uninstall lol
---
Drake would have this figured out in like 20 minutes but then take seven days because he keeps getting into accidental gun fights 
---
I think it‚Äôs rather easy in my opinion 
---
It's been a year already?! Wow...
---
nope i haven't lol
---
i don't even know a single name that worked on this game xD
---
but well its better to think of it in a positive way than whining and complaining uselessly about it 
---
Happy New Years! Lol
---
Of course not, I‚Äôm saying it would be far too long. It should never have been released in its current state. 
---
And the destiny fan self entitlement strikes again.
---
Bitch about the sleeper, nerfed.
---
Bitched about the forge being too high light. Lowered.
---
Bitched about AOS invader kills, changed it.
---
Bitched about pinnacle crucible weapons being character specific, made them account wide.
---
Bitched about having to wait for someone to solve the puzzle, everyone gets it.
---
This is getting stupid now bungie. Stop pandering to the toxicity of the fanbase
---
Oh you right
---
Looks like she brought the spaghetti.
---
Your comment is a godsendüòÇ
---
Some clues just don‚Äôt lead to the right answer
---
But are you a wayfarer? 
---
Dunemarchers. 
---
Never take them off. 
---
Is that Not Forgotten?
---
I'm trying to show you how stupid you sound with this "as an adult with a career" crap. It's irrelevant what you earn, or your ability to get job with regards to a purchase. Your argument is essentially 'everyone should be able to afford to buy every destiny expansion/pass unless their disabled' which is nonsense. 
---
Your posts are pathetic and patronising. Enjoy your negs man.
---
Ah sweet, I missed the melting point because y'all killed it too fast lol!
---
https://youtu.be/Jc7NoQpxKIw
---
^ This link is some clips of my "skillful" titan gameplay
---
and now they are unlocking it for free, smh
---
It's Dead Orbit noob
---
It didn‚Äôt bother me how long it was taking for the puzzle but this is exactly how I read the OP lol
---
Its built on a lot of peoples work, stop giving him all the credit.  Everyone has been stuck at 7 for over 8 hours and no one is any closer.
---
Why can't I meet brain dead enemies like that. Tf was they doin all lined up staring not at the line of fire but at the damn rocks. I know there's nothing there, tf server region is this? Lol
---
Well watching the streams in between AGDQ games was fun atleast but now knowing it for all for nothing kinda sucks the life out of it.
---
Nope. Can use it just like a regular bow but get that void dot on every shot.
---
It‚Äôs a little funky lookin but maybe they‚Äôre trying to show him in Golden Gun super
---
Relax it only needs to be completed once. People act like this is a huge deal lmao
---
I think OP gets that but gladds been stuck for 27. Not just 7 or 8 lol 
---
Uriel Septim VII would have a much nicer gun.
---
Only thing requiring any outside knowledge was googling one work to find out it was a forest in France, and translating a few lines of text. That's it. Everything needed to find the answers have been in the game otherwise.
---
To be fair, datto did have the solution to 6 suggested to him yesterday and blew it off.
---
Wish I had a decent Trust.
---
Or Kindled.
---
Or Nation.
---
Why does RNG hate me?
---
Bungie should've either made it timed in the first place, or stuck to their guns and not opening it until it's solved. 
---
Ones French ones Norse and the other is Japanese. That's what the consensus of puzzle 7 looks like. 3 swords from 3 different nationalities
---
Theres a number of streamers who have been on almost as long, and Gladd is getting all the credit for staying up and not being able to move an inch in the past 8 hours.  Had he pumped out 4-5 of the 6 solutions, sure...he hasn't . Not sure why longevity gets this man handies from the community.
---
This week
---
Damn. Haha.
---
Resident evil was my first realization of this. Watching my friend fight thru the directors cut, then zero, the veronica X. Just scarry action spooky shit everywhere and i was just too shit at games to do it, i HAD to watch. 
---
Eventually i got the nerve and played RE4. Finished it and beat it 6 more times just to prove to myself i had conquered my fear.
---
Hindsight maybe its fixed camera angles i had a fear of, shit makes it so much worse.
---
Got some news, no one plays the forge in their spare time.  You're in once and you're out.  Nothing fun about it so let's struggle to get this done. No hands down.
---
Same with the raid, when it went open i was like..thanks whoever ran this. Ehroar will do all the work for me.
---
This week, it's always available during high curse week.  
---
No curse week - Petra is in the Strand
---
Mid curse week - Petra is in Divalian Mists
---
High curse week - Petra is in Rheasilvia
---
cayde 6
---
Exactly, and somewhat ironic how people are bitching about bitchers. If you want a challenge then feel free to not step in the forge until you solve the puzzle. Some people have family‚Äôs and full time jobs outside of the digital world and just want to relax and play new content. It‚Äôs really not a hard concept.
---
Just for shits and giggles when doing the crucible weekly on my striker titan, because every other subclass is objectively weaker and I feel like I am self sabotaging by playing the Burning Maul subclass, which I actually like, I run into a 1v4 demolition and shoulder bashed them all, just to see if I could, didn't fire a shot.  
---
I should not be able to run at 4 people attempting to gun me down, and melee them all to death while getting my health back.  
---
What.  
---
The.  
---
Fuck.
---
*thumb starts rapidly moving involuntarily as if to press SPACE repeatedly*
---
Found the guy who complained. Hes "entitled "to the content.
---
r/iamverysmart
---
This is still a puzzle just like the old Zelda games had puzzles. The solution wasn't even that difficult on part 6, it was suggested and blown off for no reason in dattos stream last night. It's literally deciphering symbols and a story into passwords. How much more puzzle do you want? Push rock onto button a, jump to platform b, stand on button b? 
---
I got the ghost first week, the sparrow however has eluded me to this day
---
Really I find that hard to believe. I have crafted my 100 frames for the ship and still going for God roll. There are also tons of people I know who are farming for God rolls. 
---
Oh awesome! Thanks for the info!
---
I really doubt there wont be any reason for anyone else to do it. That's just an ignorant statement.
---
destiny 2 foreskin trailer last stand of the gnuslinger youtube 
---
No problem Guardian! I work in the print industry, so im constantly looking for higher resolution versions of logos and images, Google reverse image search is basically my job these days lol.
---
Lmao black armory has been pathetic. Literally should have been free
---
I kind of hope it's only like the first 100 people, so someone who didn't actively work at solving it doesn't just watch a YouTube video and get them.
---
Agree 110%. 
---
But people are gonna continue to deep throat Bungie and pretend it‚Äôs worth the money. 
---
yeah I'm going in that thing as soon as I get home from my job.  sorry bud but when you have 3 forges unlocked from quest lines and then you put this one behind an arbitrary wall (which it is or they would make it a requirement of every player to do, not just 3 and unlock it globally) yeah I'm not all about that. 
---
I agree wholeheartedly. However imo, if they were going to set up a challenge in front of this new forge, I would have much preferred a sort of dungeon, with maybe this puzzle on the side for an extra valuable reward.
---
This is a fair and valid point i understand! 
---
Maybe they‚Äôll find a happy medium where they release ‚Äúelite‚Äù content that requires time, skill, and community effort to solve, but not for something like this. Secrets like how they handled the Whisper could be better, where a puzzle is discovered and then solved, so that people are excited about it. I think part of why this seemed to flop (which I‚Äôm sad about because I thought it was really cool) is because it‚Äôs part of a hyped up thing and people aren‚Äôt used to waiting or having to do this kind of work for content. It‚Äôs just too different from what a lot of people expect. And unfortunately, lots of people act like if something is not their idea of fun (which admittedly puzzles aren‚Äôt for everyone), it‚Äôs terrible. And honestly we‚Äôve been conditioned by most modern games to be a little lazy. Most games that aren‚Äôt actually puzzle games don‚Äôt require much brainpower. 
---
However, if Bungie keeps puzzles and uniquely designed stuff like this in their bag and implements them more and more in the game but in a less public way (like how they did Whisper), I think that would be much more successful. And it could shift the way the community thinks about it.
---
Scissors! ‚úå I lose
---
Wow... There goes that two hours spent trying
---
you look cool af
---
It was actually the other way around.  Bungie was undercover in the Twitch chat trying to help the streamers through Stage 6, and the streamers kept calling them small brain idiots.
---
That's the only reason I see. I'm not happy with what's happening but in this scenario it makes sense. 
---
But it's not getting it to a better place, it's showing whiny fans that bitching gets them what they want
---
Thanks man, much appreciated :3
---
I did go do something else. But it was the same shit I've been doing for 4 months since forsaken launched, or for a year since d2 launched.
---
The puzzle being difficult is fine, it just shouldn't have been mandatory to unlocking the forge.
---
I play destiny almost every day, but I don't have what it takes to do this puzzle, so instead I get to sit on the sidelines and wait instead of playing new content that I know is in the game.
---
Not only that, a few Bungie employees were amongst the group of us begging them to all shoot trees.  The devs were trying to give hints to the streamers, and in return, they got called small brain idiots.  So today they said screw it, we're unlocking the forge.
---
Got the Curated Shotty and the Exotic launcher last week.
---
Did I say ANYTHING about it needing to be completed more than once??  All I said was this is misstep #3 for them... And I'm not in the minority, you are good sir. I just replied to OP's post, I didn't make up my own about how I'm treated unfairly or anything.... I'm actually quite relaxed, as I haven't been able to play as I've been at work since Monday and haven't been able to get on until this evening.. it's a deal to more than half of the player base, mind you. Please let me know when you have something more than an asinine, throw-away comment to add to the discussion
---
Same. Showing the toxic fans that bitching constantly gets you what you want. Also kind of shitting on people that have been trying to work out the labs for the last 30 hours or so
---
Having to use external sources instead of using information from the game, makes it seem like it the puzzle wasn‚Äôt designed very well.

Zeyd#1998 on bnet. On most evenings
---
Wtf were they doing?!  Lol
---
I always forget about that cheap ass thing. I should use it again. It's been a long time and would no longer feel shame. 
---
Nevermind, I just read your other responses. You don't have anything useful to add, just trolling. Have a good day guardian
---
I just got my 3rd one now.. I hate this bow coz it's using my exotic rng on this thing , for 3rd fucking time in 4 days.
---
Not really a throwaway comment when im exactly right. Majority of the playerbase isnt max light. They still have plenty to do. The ones that are max light can either help with the puzzle, do some raids or forges, or go outside
---
You're really lucky! I don't have either of those :(
---
How is this trolling?
---
Horror‚Äôs Least dropped on my first clear! :D still need the sparrow, ship and ghost though... -_- 
---
Dude, idk what a Niobe lab is. 
---
Alright bud. I just responded to a post, I forgot how awesome u are at parties
---
If only we had a trade system ffs 
---
How did you get the ghost? its the only thing I am missing T-T
---
Destroy all corrupted eggs (40 with wish ender) 
---
You're not my real dad!!
---
Good one. I just responded to a comment that some butthurt dumbass posted.
---
Ascendant chall. And i too am missing it with 1 chance left. Hope my hunter clutches it
---
To think, a multiplayer game has a multiplayer puzzle.  
---
I completely agree. I honestly love this game to the point I bought the best headset, best tv, best Xbox, specially for this game. It‚Äôs the only hobby I have and thoroughly enjoy it when I have free time. I was extremely disappointed Tuesday because my plans were to hop in and enjoy a new activity to see that it was some insane puzzle. Looking at it now I respect the fact they tried something new for the community and responded immediately when they saw the community feedback. You have to respect that. 
---
Got it from the chest from one of the ascendant challenges. It has the highest drop rate there. 
---
Add a mystery that takes time and effort to see the pay off the community complains. Add and activity where majority of it can be experienced in a few days the community complains
---
Best of luck my man
---
Now that's funny... 
---
Butthurt dumbass? Please dude, don't be a keyboard warrior. Ur real tough behind that screen of urs
---
Likewise...?
---
Yeah, I love how online brings us together.  It can also cause this awful thing were everything is meta and min/max.  
---
RE5 was my jam, mostly because the wife played it with me.
---
You missed the point of doing something else. If you loved on destiny and saw that there was a brick wall in the way of attempting the new content, why didn't you just log off and go do *something else entirely*? 
---
Destiny is not mandatory to your life. Being disappointed by something that you expected not being available immediately upon a day that you thought it would be if a waste of your time and energy. When that happens it's time to step back and find something else to fill the time slot for the day. Taking a nap is a better use of your time than being annoyed by something like this
---
I have no prob finding u. That's what's wrong with people. .. they have NO IDEA who they're talking to and just spout whatever they want, including name calling
---
When pretty much all of the vocal people in your community want something, wakeboard when the whole season of the forge has hinted at them, you tend to give in to that. The quiet players not submitting feedback or suggestions will never be heard. 
---
You may need a 4th account soon
---
FYI: After you finish this forge, you'll need to kill vex for the third forge clue. Stay on nessus 
---
Either way your imput is welcome. I also agree with you.
---
I call it aimbot
---
How where why?
---
Because they think they're better than everyone else since they have a following
---
If you are looking to find a game that bends 100% to hardcore then you will never find one, the hard core is a loud minority however the "pethetic casuals" are where 90% of the sales are.  Any developer with a brain will add stuff for the hardcore but will still make sure the 90% are good because they would rather lose 10% sales next time not 90%.
---
I saw elsewhere someone suggest what may have been a perfect middle ground. Make puzzle a "secret quest" apart from the forge itself. Also, saw someone say niobe had 14 children who were killed by arrows. If so, there really better be checkpoints.

Whatever you used to buy it you will have to again
---
Gameplay?
---
Last Word has never been a PvE weapon. I highly doubt it‚Äôll be viable in any sort. As the comment below me mentions, hip fire would more than likely increase ROF. 
---
I used it and nothing seemed to happen
---

---
Is it a heavy weapon? Did it drop without you forging a powerful frame?
---
Sorry, your submission has been automatically removed.

It appears you are asking a question about LFG/Clans, or help in-game. 
---
Please post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/89vbwr/official_lfg_megathread_version_20/?sort=new) instead, look at the LFG dropdown menu on the top bar of the subreddit for various LFG tools, or check the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/8ji06r/official_faq_please_read_before_posting/) for possibly helpful advice on how to find people to play with our advertise/find clans.

What quest? I see no quest
---
lmaooooo.
---
Ikr
---
I keep the 650 tigerspites for infusion fodder and binned the rest. Got one god roll that was fun to use for a while but I just use breakneck
---
"First of all, much respect to those who are actually putting in HOURS to solving these puzzles."  Sorry, these are not puzzles as the solution to 6 was arbitrary with no intuitive design to lead to the problem being solved. 
---
I'm considering this a troll until there is proof that it has actually dropped, not just the details screen.
---
They used those exact words lol.  It's somewhat of a meme now [https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/ae71gy/twitch\_chat\_during\_niobe\_labs\_streams/](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/ae71gy/twitch_chat_during_niobe_labs_streams/)
---
I agree there's a few things Bungie could have done better, but it was their first time trying something new and there was no way to test something of this scale.  Overall it was immersive and fun for a few hours, which I believe is what they wanted.  They just didn't expect Stage 6 to take 16+ hours.
---
I do believe it is a special weapon
---
Many people are saying that it dropped from bergusia, so i guess it's true
---
Go to Ada, you can trade it in for radiance - a buff for forge weapons
---
It's an early drop, but not the first. There are a few posts before yours
---
No woosh, just a bad attempt at humor.
---
As a strike you can select it from the dreaming city and as a nightfall you can re-select it from the vanguard section of your director if that‚Äôs what you mean üëç
---
Yo I'm down as fuck you can do it with 6 people 
---
I don't even bother. I'll do the heroic adventure and a PE while I'm there, then come back later in the week once it resets haha. 
---
Yep...
---
If you want proof you're going to have to search his stream for it. Idk what time they started so I have no idea how far into the stream it happened. It was around the time they began saying they were done with words and letters. Like 9/9:30 est
---
How do you do it with 6 people ? üòÇüòÇ
---
When you're coming in theres one in the very back under the floor and on a pillar and the other one when youre coming in is on the right on the left pillar.
---
I'm not saying bend to hardcore mentality. Im saying that there is now literally nothing to play. Now that all of the grubby little casuals... You included im guessing... Get their hamds on the forge without doing any work whats the point? Might as well just given the weapons and armor fdom this dlc to eververse and sold it for silver. No one takes any sense of accomplishment in what they do. Its i want it now! (Screams until beet red and stamps foot)
---
Sweet, thanks.
---
Wait what?? I dropped at the start of the game when I saw I was put against a 4 stack probably two dozen times while grinding breakneck and never got more than a warning saying I was "disappointing the drifter"
---
You just have them join you like a raid. It's a glitch and I think they just left it 
---
When your angry "MAXIMUM TEMPER"
---
Just complete the forge again.
---
my friend got it from first completion of bergusia forge im not sure if you need a frame but he had one at the time
---
It should be fun and powerful at least. I don't want to use Last Word and keep thinking that I'm crippling myself by not using something else.
