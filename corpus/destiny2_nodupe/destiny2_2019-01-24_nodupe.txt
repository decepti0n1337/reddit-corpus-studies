Dude, have you checked out AoS with Rasmussen Clan? It's got that Gambit vibe. #Rasmussen~~Klan~~Clan
---
---
---
Holy fuck!! That is incredible.  You should post to Bungie‚Äôs twitter !!
---
I'm confused, did you attached the wrong video or? I didn't see anything about shotguns
---
I think your mistaken. In the title you said shotguns, but in reality it was a sidearm that killed you. Common mistake
---
Same, but with screebing Ursa Furiosa.
---

---
I hope you find it soon, br√∂ther.
---
Have a look at his feet
---
Watch his feer
---
Lasagna big
---
You can easily finish every heroic event solo if you do it right. Only one that's iffy is Spire Integration.
---
Br√∂ther
---
OMG I DIDNT EVEN NOTICE!!!! HOLY FUCKK! 
---
Lasagna big 
---
Shit. Only exotic piece of armor I've had drop for my Titan is that one eyed skull helmet. That's it. The rest won't drop for me at all.
---
eternal blazon with the calus selected shader
---
'Attempt'. Looks like a no scope headshot to me.
---
Oooooh. Haha that's new, all he needs is a Luna on the other foot and he's set
---
Makes sense, thanks!
---
it was the eternal blazon and coup lol
---
Xur shows up in two days. If you have most of the exotics then the chances you'll get it are good.
---
And a Telesto in his hands for good measure
---
Vicious downvoters. He probably just bought the game and was scrolling the subreddit. Hive people a break.
---
Well it still would be if people would play it... and if trials was there.
---
Now like one of your french girls...but for reals though, like a french girl
---
And that‚Äôs why watching clips on console is in a different league than pc. I was a pc gamer for years from the time of Unreal Tournament and Quake. It became a chore keeping up with gpu and processor speeds as well as having kids so I went the route of console for ease of use. Console is much easier to pick up and play and not nearly as cluttered with hax0rz but ultimately suffers from a lack of control and thus the smoothness you speak of. 
---
Skullfort is awesome 
---
I dig tf outta this idea.
---
shoot the template
---
Woosh
---
Why am I never partied with people like you.
---
lemme get the template 
---
Gotcha üëç
---
This is literally my collection screen
---
Look on YouTube forsaken cutscenes it‚Äôll be on there for you 
---
I used it all the time until they ruined it with an update between y3 and y4. It just didn‚Äôt feel the same. 
---
I suppose you don't know what Google is neither then. 
---
Big if true
---
Console players
---
Play on console
---
Yeah man! I understand that pc parts are not cheap. I 100% agree with this post!
---
what cloak is that ?
---
Triple no
---
I'm mad just looking at this, because as soon as I entered the thread, it sniped me. Your shading definitely improved.
---
Are you suggesting that pigeons migrate? 
---
Our bad for trying to win üôÑ
---
A shutdown super is a shutdown super, who woulda thought.
---
So old COD? 
---
You don‚Äôt change genders after you die. 
---
Hey...that's pretty good !
---
Quadruple no 
---
You misspelled one eyed mask.
---
Nice. I‚Äôve always wanted an Apple sticker for my car!
---
Nsfw please
---
At least on armour there's random rolls to look forward to
---
It has heavy ammo finder...that‚Äôs all it needs lol
---
Gosh I wanna buy this for my new apartment, great job 
---
Sorry, kinda new to the DLC and destiny. What is osprey and what is the strange terrain?
---
I actually just started using them a couple weeks ago...I love them and the ornament for them.
---
dem bubbles.. . yer killin me o_O
---
otherwise, brilliant sticker yo :)
---
There's some stuff about The Draw (the last word) quest being added later in January, but past that I don't think they've said much about newer content. 
---
Not saying I would rather a 50-50 chance but I feel 94% is a bit extreme and shouldn't happen at all.
---
it was an accident
---
Why are you ruining a good thing here?
---
I havent gotten the ship yet so I feel your pain.
---
And they will need it before I even get it
---
Yes, yes it would. 
---
Oooh new raid in the summer. Thank you!
---
Septuple no
---
?
---
The FOV and the way analogue sticks move the view around is just eugh.
---
I think 36 is my most. 
---
Heavy ammo RNGESUS blessed me that game. 
---
Good for you. Congratulations on your pvp exotic.
---
I got shards by ranking up in crucible üëâüòéüëâ
---
Not really, I have a 47% WR with just over a 1 KD and managed to get lunas only soloing and duo with an irl friend every now and then 
---
New to the game, so sorry if this is a dumb question, but what gun is that?
---
Feel you. This damn ghost shell is the one and only item that is missing for my cursebreaker title. :(
---
Titan main here, we dont have it too good. Low mobility, cant dodge, cant teleport, one of our supers is complete shit (the swinging a hammer in a circle).
---
You just have to beat the nf now
---
If you play Gambit, I highly recommend using it. It's great for beefy enemies, blockers, envoys, and pesky Invaders that get too close.
---
it's lore, all exotics and a number of legendaries have lore with them.  At the bottom of the screen when you're inspecting an exotic, there should be a prompt to press a button for "Lore" and it pulls a menu out of the left side of the screen with some kind of lore focused around that weapon/armor piece.
---
What‚Äôs this about rat king?
---
How tho 
---
melting point, 2 stacks of slayer, and 3 missile titans
---
Be the one who moves, not the one who *is* moved.
---
Why tag it
---
If you do that, all you will lose is the Pursuits inventory page for the deleted character and all items currently on it. The vault and collections stay, as do the consumables, mods, and shaders inventories. 
---
Lol I‚Äôm literally the only one of my friends who pronounces any of the names correctly
---
I tried it it for a few games and it destroyed everything
---
Meh, fuck em. 
---
Ppl need to lighten up and if some1 'bumps' me for a window vinyl then they need professional help.
---
Nice. Sadly it's no longer available, so you cherish this.
---
It just puts you 20 feet forward based on momentum. If you're moving up, you go up. Falling? You teleport down. 
---
Whoah woah woah. The demos not out yet! Or is this dev stream footage
---
Perfect thank you. 
---
Noice!
---
I hope you guys don't have a sister üò∂
---
If you were to do that I believe you'd only lose his pursuits and equiped gear
---
Hes there all the way till tuesday reset:)
---
Yeah I've always thought this is dumb. Why the fuck can't we shade exotics? It's messing with my armors vibe guys.
---
Whatever, keep shooting at nothing dude /s
---
That would be a valid point if the average player wasn‚Äôt being hindered by the system. If it was somebody playing 1 day a week complaining about cores, they‚Äôre opinion on the system would be irrelevant. But when the average player is being forced to either play more or be forced to wait weeks at a time to stack up enough cores to masterwork 1 gun, it‚Äôs a problem. It‚Äôs not because they can‚Äôt or don‚Äôt want to put in the time. Putting in the time shouldn‚Äôt mean playing an abnormal amount for something that‚Äôs such a small part of the actual grind. Putting in the time should be a legit grind to get cores. There is literally no legit grind for cores. 
---
Destiny has never been this grindy after D1 Y1 &amp; it was for the better. D1 Y3 is the best the game has ever been in terms of grind because of how accessible everything was while still having loot chases for hard core players. Raid gear was worth having, both weapons &amp; armor, where as in D2 there will be 2 weapons per raid worth having &amp; the armor is completely irrelevant. 
---
Not masterworkig something doesn‚Äôt make a weapon bad, that‚Äôs true, but masterworking something will always make it better. 
---
are the players who put time and effort into getting a coveted weapon not supposed to be allowed to use it?
---
The annual pass doesn't include Forsaken, but you can buy both of them bundled together for a slight discount. 
---
It's so fucking good, that it's bad. This is due to there not being enough STREAMER CLOUT üòéüòéüòéüòé
---
I like the 1st. They‚Äôre both incredible 
---
Not saying they can't use it. It's just annoying that everyone runs it in quick play like its trials. 
---
*hangs up violently and continues jacking off*
---
Jesus where do I find potatos to fight against? 3 of them were in their own world as they let you kill them..
---
Seems more like "there is" but either way
---
I‚Äôm 650 and I don‚Äôt know how to do the raids but everyone is just looking for kwtd and not teaching others 
---
How much to buy lol
---
Sorry, this guy sold a while ago. But thank you! 
---
Go to the r/destinythegame discord and there is LFG groups for nightfalls all the time
---
I would if i had it.
---
Cool beans

8 more exotics to find and more adventures to come.
---
Lol it was stopped and he had green left turn. It wasn‚Äôt even my turn but I was trying to catch the sticker. 
---
Came across this tonight, playing with someone who was under finishing up the quest step to unlock the dreaming city. He was fireteam leader. Any ideas?
---
Sounds fun as well!
---
This art is ‚ÄúAlright, alright, alright.‚Äù
---
Noice, that's how I got through malfeasance.
---
Doesn‚Äôt have access...means he doesn‚Äôt have DLC.
---
It's Bungie's microtransaction vendor. Not Activision's 
---
Dang brother 
---
U dont even need to Touch raids to get to 650
---
But it helps
---
What purple shader is that? It‚Äôs pretty. üîÆ
---
For the wishender bow quest 
---
Thank you!
---
Not realy
---
They‚Äôre season weapons, which means it could take months to get. Some people get it faster by playing with a good fireteam. Get over it.
---
He has same season pass as me. We finished forsaken together. I went a little further and locked dreaming city. He is doing that now.  Any idea what Forsaken content is attached to that weird orb? I dont remember ever seeing that when I was running through 
---
Ots the day before mine; happy early birthday birthday cousin!
---
well, the leviathan has 2 artificial stars above the highest tower. i'm sure as shit they can afford birds.
---
[Here you go ](https://share.icloud.com/photos/0uLoHJGeAAWZSCtlwWGed_Puw#St._Catharines_-_Brockview) 
---
Thanks so much!
---
It was the answer, seems like it does less damage now.
---
The last word pre nerf was the best in PvP 
---
Try the lost sector by the fucturescape you get one every time you complete it. 
---
You might have not done a quest step. You gat another exotic item that shows you places you can get them from. The item makes you do a specific heroic and a few other things.
---
That last part was sick!
---
Attempt... my lawd that is more detailed than the actual game it‚Äôs perfect
---
Just depo 5 - 10, and if you see their invasion portal activate then depot what you got, if they just got killed when they invade then get all you can and deposit 
---
So much work for just a sparrow.
---
both raids drop fusions
---
THERE'S A CAT?!
---
I *think* it's more likely on Powerful drops but take that with a grain of salt, as I've only had it drop on items all of like... twice.
---
Looks great on a couple of sparrows and jumpships. Not so hot on most armour though.
---
At least luck is on someone's side, I hope it's a blast to play with!
---
Every asian I play against or with suck a massive amount of ass
---
This happened to me and my buddies the other day, 10/10 thanks Bungo!!
---
I‚Äôm not crying, you‚Äôre crying
---
The only thing I can agree on you with is yes, matchmaking needs to be a lot better, so people grinding for it don‚Äôt run into people with NF more often. But to say that the best players don‚Äôt deserve the best gear is just crazy imo. And also, imo, matchmaking isn‚Äôt going to get better until there is a much larger player base for competitive again (bringing trials back). If you look it‚Äôs about 50/50 with PVP and PVE but that doesn‚Äôt break down quick play versus competitive players I think. 
---
You can use a distant relations gambit lightweight and militias birthright breach grenade from nightfall. 
---
Xur shows up tomorrow, if you‚Äôve already got all the Y1 Engram weapons and other armor pieces, you could farm about ~97 Legendary Shards and could finally bag that Skullfort if you buy Xur‚Äôs Fated Engram on your Titan, it‚Äôs really helpful for finishing up Year 1 Exotic collections
---
I'm hurt but i won't downvote but don't expect an iPhone either
---
):&lt;
---
Someone give cayde crimson.
---
I love it when people do shit like this! Hahaha
---
Nice clip, that ornament is beautiful
---
Thats depends on what you're looking for 
---
Omg screw you lol. I‚Äôve run the mission 3 times since release and never got a sparrow. Same goes goes for shattered Throne and the ship. 
---
I think this week is the sniper my man
---
Pm me if you‚Äôre on PS4, I‚Äôll help ya do last wish and Scourge if you want? My friends and I Sherpa quite a bit and don‚Äôt mind taking it slow if that‚Äôs something you‚Äôre worried about.
---
Lol it's not auto aim.
---
It was YOU....   
---
  
---
Seriously though, it's okay. We all make mistakes. Thanks for the apology.
---
But my uncle works for bungie
---
My comment was supposed to be a answer to someone who was upset people don't Google it 
---
Literally saw him last night. Was taken aback
---
It's a joke because there are 3 enhanced avalible perks
---
Yeah, feel free to message me and we can set up a time :)
---
You're being a dick by assuming you know enough about OP to determine if they're selfish or lazy.  They posted a meme for comedic value.  Even if true, there was a time for all of us when we didn't know.  So you can solve the problem by teaching or you can be part of the problem by name calling and being judgemental.  I think maybe you're just frustrated by having public events ruined so often and are taking it out on an internet stranger.      
---
The Catalyst is a very light yellow almost white engram. 
---
Thanks, I appreciate the offer. I'm on ps4 but I'm also dredgen so I'm doing OK I guess. 
---
Where do you get this emote?
---
Thanks, appreciated. I'm dredgen but on ps4 so alas it's not meant to be. 
---
Thanks for the help. I would have completed the story sooner but... Well they won't be winning any awards for the story of voice acting
---
&amp;nbsp; 
---
On a not too different of a note, playing this game with an actual voice actor was a fun experience since he could not stop talking about how bored and uninterested everyone sounds. If you'd told me that they developed a voice synth that doesn't sound like Siri to read their lines i would be inclined to believe you. Getting through the story is... not the most fun thing about this game, by quite a stretch 
---
It looks like a hand cannln, doesn't feel like one tbh.
---
Yes it goes but you will only get Luna on your hunter, 
---
But for instance with the new grenade launcher the quest is a triumph so it is split up across accounts so as long as you have picked it up on all characters you can finish it on one and receiver 3 grenade launchers 
---
Crosshairs snapped onto those enemies, I have a hard time believing that‚Äôs all skill.
---
nothing more satisfying then beating a 4 stack with a group of randoms.
---
... obtained if you play the game in a PC cafe that subscribed to Blizzard Korea's services.
---
Hero. I'll get in contact after work ‚ô• 
---
Damn you mate. You deserve a medal. I farmed this secotor for the wayfarer title. I really tried to get up there with my lock and hunter but didn't managed to do so. Now I feel like a total dumbass. Thanks a lot for this. I might for then for more since I still need the 40 nodes triumph.
---
Stunning work man. Work on that talent some more and make it ‚Äúsleepless‚Äù. That kind of talent and art should never go to sleep. Congrats, it‚Äôs just stunning. 
---
In retrospect, I can definitely see where you are coming from. Sorry how my comment comes off as harsh. I can see how you were just trying to post something amazing you saw, but just be sure you credit the original creator so they too can get some credit
---
Blah blah blah. Whiny post number 10000 about how it‚Äôs not fair that I don‚Äôt have the Luna‚Äôs and they should just make it easier for me. 
---
It‚Äôs the matchmaking or it‚Äôs the load outs or it‚Äôs going against teams and I‚Äôm solo blah blah blah. 
---
It‚Äôs never that they just aren‚Äôt good enough. 
---
Literally everyone that has it had to go through the same shit so quit bitching and making excuses and either give up or just get better. The only exception to that would be the chumps that paid for it and then it‚Äôs pretty much useless in their hands because they can‚Äôt make the headshots or play around its weaknesses. 
---
I‚Äôm sorry but I‚Äôm so sick of these damn posts. 
---
It‚Äôs a nice gun. I suggest using Targeting Adjuster though. You don‚Äôt really need the extra bullets with how fast it reloads with Drop Mag, and it helps a bit with those headshots. 
---
That‚Äôs no Titan 
---
Hey mate, it's really sad :(  
---
Btw, what is the website that you're using to see that ?
---
Same thing happened to us. EU servers right? They were abusing an exploit/hack and were aimbotting also. One of our guys whispered them about their cheats and promptly got DOS'd as well. One guy in our fireteam was streaming the entire ordeal so we have VOD's too. Guy on the level 20 is probably abusing so his main doesn't get banned; hopefully they get IP banned so they stop this BS
---
100% they are cheating. We just went against them not 10 mins ago twice.chip is hella cheating with the vig wing and he was aim botting also. and when i pmed one of there team and said they are all getting reporting for running with a cheater they ddosed us all.
---
DRAW FOREVER GUARDIAN!!!
---
Yeah you got the curated roll one and you have a chance of getting them while you have a powerful frame and you forge it in the Bergusia forge. If you get the curated one you will also get a second random rolled one (just like you did). 
---
Oh sweety, this week it's only the sniper rifle.
---
Correct
---
Hey, at least I play solo and not with a 6-stack
---
I checked and yes... The titan did have insurmountable skullfort.  
---
I hate him 
---
[removed]
---
Lol, I hope I will be able to hit my shots so I can cross map them before they get to me
---
Wow you had a 2/3 chance and you failed, I got destiny on Xbox and PC, don‚Äôt have forsaken on Xbox tho 
---
Once you hit the level cap, you get a lot of daily and weekly quests to increase in power, but you can also just get random drops through playing.  
---
There's at least one reward that is limited to one attempt a week per character, but most gameplay is not like that.
---
If you're in KWTD. Teaching it is a nightmare.
---
Xbox controllers are poop. They just want us to keep buying controllers
---
escape-fu :)
---
Disregarding the 3 potatoes.
---
That torpedo at the end was epic.
---
Impressive, but I feel Mars lost sector is just the best for fast frame building.
---
Someone has never played CS:GO
---
That‚Äôs what I did for getting mars nodes 
---
I just commented this but this guy probably playes games like CS:GO. That aim is completely normal on PC, he's just good. Git gud console peasant.
---
"ENEMIES EVERYWHERE!" -Every Mass Effect enemy
---
omg.
---
We have the same beard type. 
---
High impact, adaptive, and rapid fire are all getting buffs. Precision stay as is.
---
Well he walks clear out of the one that's to his left in the beginning, the one further into the open lane tags him towards the middle of the clip and then again, not standing directly in its blast radius. 
---
Someone needs to stop crying and DEPOSIT MORE MOTES!   
---
Jk , but yeah a competitive ranking system would do the game more wonders.
---
We live in dark times if one has to add /sarcasm to such comments.
---
Well the targets were pretty easy to see because of the lightning, they were all standing pretty close to each other, and I‚Äôm on 10 sensitivity PS4. All it takes is like one flick to get to each one. Its really not that hard.
---
It's PS4. 
---
Gives a damage buff to you against primeval. Makes it quicker to take it down before invader kills you to heal primeval
---
Dude ouch that‚Äôs so many frames. I got mine on my 3rd with flared magwell. I need to farm it next time it‚Äôs around for surrounded + rampage and outlaw + rampage
---
I mean this *is* a thread about lord of the rings lore.
---
wait, that's not a meme
---
YEEEEEEEEEEEET
---
OP just doesn't want to invest the effort to actually obtain lunas, he wants to use the same brainless loadout as always and have it handed to him. 
---
What shader is that? 
---
Raids have pretty good exotic drop rates.
---
WOW!!
---
Have you tried getting better at the game instead of making excuses?
---
They pay the guy, then the guy signs into your account and does the weapon quest(s) for you
---
gun and beard are OP - Bungie please NERF!
---
The armor?
---
Thanks again 
---
Well ikelos shotgun doesn't even drop this week. Sniper rifle this week, I believe..
---
Seen alot of forsaken exotics drops in the tier 3 blind wells lately 
---
*quickplay
---
Remember in D1 when throwing knife could one shot
---
There's another boss in the strand on the dreaming city that works really good as well. He's easier to kill but after the drive there it might be slower
---
Yeah southern one, I meant the northern one. 
---
A second honest review- I am enslaved to the elite. I can't play a FPS with a normal controller anymore- it's that good. The weight in your hands, the customization available, etc. Unfortunately I've had to return mine numerous times for broken bumpers and terrible stick drift. Buying the extended warranty was actually helpful this time. Best Buy has got to hate me at this point.
---
After you finish the forsaken campaign get to level 50 with 500 light, that is the soft cap where blues are no longer powerful. After that you will want to do the powerful gear on the star chart and that will get you to about 510-520 depending on rng. From there you can unlock the dreaming city from a quest given to you at the end of the dlc. 
---
From there the game opens up a lot as the dreaming city drops things high above your light. After a week or 2 of doing powerful gear you should be high enough to take on the last wish raid and really be ready for endgame. 
---
If you really want to farm a pvp loadout i would recommend farming a good shotgun seeing as the pvp meta revolves around them rn. Cammycakes has a good guide on how to farm dust rock blues which is a top tier pvp shotty. 
---
You will also want to complete the caydes will quest to get ace of spades if interested in pvp. It is one of the top 2 handcannons and is essential to competitive pvp. 
---
Lastly you will want to do ‚Äúthe whisper‚Äù quest on the weekend to get a black hammer clone from d1. Still as powerful as you remember and is as important as ghorn was in d1. 
---
Other than that the game opens up a lot at the end game and there is no concrete path on what to do. Just do what you enjoy even if it is not efficient. 
---
Wow thats amazing 
---
Luna's Howl is scared of Duke Mk 44 kill clip+outlaw.
---
I don't know, I kind of like it 
---
Makes it look almost like a different gun
---
... From borderlands 
---
Yeah, the stability is mostly useless for PC and I‚Äôm really enjoying the quickdraw. I‚Äôm farming for a Full Bore + Accurized + Quickdraw + Kill Clip Tatara Gaze this week. Having three quickdraw weapons should be amusing in Crucible. 
---
When Bungie partners with Valve and gives us the Loose Cannon.
---
I've read a few of them, the skullfort is definitely my favorite. 
---
Thanks for offering advice instead of being mean :,)
---
The ol ghost jump. Reminiscent of grabbing that sniper on Blood Gulch
---
I‚Äôm a PvE player almost exclusively and a warlock main so quick draw isn‚Äôt great for what I do. Still better than a lot of options though 
---
From the link: 
---
&gt;The Level 7 boss itself...
---
&gt;...always drops the shader, GenotypeNull-Zero, directly (not in the chest).
---
...has a chance to directly drop one of three IKELOS weapons (again, not in the chest) at a low Power level.
---
The only way to get the BA shotgun is the raid. It doesn't come from a weapon frame. 
---
I think your load out was part of your problem, Trust and Bygones are similar weapons in terms of range and use. Good for killing smaller enemies and nice range, but you won't be able to kill blockers and other orange bar biggies fast unless you have a grenade/melee ability or rocket ready and at shorter distance you'll rely solely on hitting things. I know this is hard to hear for a titan, but sometimes a Shotgun, SMG, Fusion Rifle or even a Sidearm is a better option than punching. 
---
If the fallen use it, then why I'm not getting wrecked by them in Gambit?
---
Then you gotta use graviton forfeit and either a sniper or a slug shotgun for that max sneaky boye
---
What did he drop? 
---
If you are not lvl 50, you need to get there.  Use an XP ghost or a fireteam medalion (medalions are better).
---
Next is working towards 650 light.  Until you reach soft cap (which is now 600) you will get higher drops from just about everything.  If you have a piece that is lagging by more than 20 pts, buy one from collections.  Otherwise, grind out dailies and weeklies.  Y1 stuff (dailies, flashpoint, etc.) gives power gear that is 2-3 above max light, once you reach soft cap. Y2 stuff(Spider's gold wanted, Dreaming City, and Forge stuff) gives power gear that is 3-5 above max light.  If you have a piece that is more than 5 pts behind, do Y1 stuff first to get that piece.  If everything is pretty close in light do Y2 stuff first.
---
Infusion of weapon and gear should be done sparingly.  Only infuse if the item being used as infusion materials is the same as the one you are infusing into or if the piece is your god roll go to piece for that slot that you just can't play with out and it is going up over 8 light. 
---
Meta weapons in PVP at the moment are hand cannons, pulse rifles, and shotguns, so if you are a pvper you want to find armor with perks that will enhance those weapons, or what ever your weapons of choice are,  based on your playstyle.   
---
There are a few must have weapons in the game:
---
Whisper of the Worm can only be gotten from a quest that is only available Friday to Monday, and you will need a fireteam to do it.  (Need to be 580 for this quest)
---
Sleeper Simulant is available through a quest on Mars. (If you haven't completed this quest line, grind it out quickly.  It is a very useful weapon.)
---
The Bad Omens rocket launcher curated roll can be gotten from reseting gambit infamy 2 times in one season. (The curated roll is masterworked for blast radius and has tracking and cluster bombs.  It is a must have for the Last Wish Raid for most lfg groups.)
---
The Ikelos shotgun drops from the lvl 7 boss of Escalation Protocal on Mars (not easy to get, only available on certain weeks and has a very low drop rate, but worth the grind).
---
There are others such as the Ace of Spades, Luna's Howel, Not Forgotten, ect that all come from questlines.

If you have not joined a clan, you should.  There are extra power engrams available and you can meet people that will be able to do various activies with you.
---
That's cool and all but I can just titan jump up there from a rock
---
Probably when the next expansion comes out our the player count drops again
---
Awesome!
---

---
I've rarely run into people using Luna's howl, but I sure do get horrible or afk teammates non-stop. 
---
i have a team dont worry i dont play gambit solo
---
however having only one queue hurts the gamemode but perhaps you're too delusional to realize
---
What are those red things that dropped for him? 
---
You play on PC or console?
---
Your hunter and warlock look amazing but that titan looks like... Bionicle. It's weird, sorry üòÇ
---
Bungie has never implemented a system like that, we‚Äôve been asking for years now, it‚Äôs just not gonna happen 
---

Competitive is fun depending on your glory level. Once you get to 4500+ I‚Äôll call it, finding games takes a long time and it‚Äôs not fun to sit in orbit for a long time. Also, while it is fun to sweat I personally don‚Äôt want to be sweating all the time, so I play quickplay to relax and casually talk with my friends. If I‚Äôm playing comp I can‚Äôt do that cause I gotta be focused on call outs and team plays. 
---
Could I ask what your glory is ? Because there is a higher chance that you‚Äôre in the lower glory tier and Bungies matchmaking is just working properly for you, which is great. But once you get around 2200+ it becomes more sweaty and only worsens. 
---
Fuck talented people, I can barely draw a stick figure
---
That part will come. Don‚Äôt focus too hard, else you won‚Äôt be having fun. You‚Äôll get the wins in, I believe in you

Ah see well thats probably why lol. I'm on PS4 and I cannot go into a game of quickplay and be against at least 3 other Luna's
---
Cute barbecue.
---
Powerful rewards, Prime engrams. Any exotic quest you may have not completed. But you won't finish that forge at 600 unless you're being hard carried. 615 is the level you want if you want tp contribute to finishing the forge.
---
I mean, all you do is rent them while in the internet cafe.  Pretty unspectacular outside of the small bits of lore that Destiny:Guardians world has that apparently ours doesn't.  
---
Not a fan of basically an entire NPC faction existing only in one version to push subscription services.  
---
There is really only one way to increase your power level past 500. This is to do activities that give "powerful gear" and to kill things until prime engrams drop.

I used a trust to get to my Luna. And still use it to this day as it‚Äôs flinch can make anyone with a Luna‚Äôs miss. Trust is one of, if not the best 180 hand cannon in the game. And it‚Äôs range is very noticeable, source I‚Äôve got 3k kills with my Luna‚Äôs and unfortunately no masterworked pvp stat track trust as it is a great pve roll too
---
I literally am only trying to get it to have fun in the crucible. It's either that or I don't play it. I miss D1

Eh, it‚Äôs destiny, nothing makes sense. Although I do believe that it shoots energy not an actual projectile.

It still seems inconsistant though.

Was it a Jade Rabbit?

Sad to say it but throw that trash out

There is, look up laser sintering. I want one so bad but they cost like a million each, it‚Äôs insane.

You can jump to the bosses in the 2 taken Lost Sectors in the Dreaming City without having to use a sparrow. Much faster than this but this is still cool too though. 
---
Yeah its pretty good . Does plenty of boss damage to.

Don't have a twitter but I can't find you on instagram :( Could you PM me a link?

Lunas howl is more scared of ace of spades 
---
Same though, 3D printing is insanely addictive. I have 6 right now and I‚Äôve probably spent $3.5k on the printers and filament. 
---
yea, kind wish Bungie would filter out Luna's Howl and Not Forgotten players into a there own matchmaking, its not really fun having stack of Lunas and NFs while your griding to achieve that.
---
anyways it won't happen so it a bitterness of the D2s Matchmaking.
---
If you tip it the wrong way it has drop mag
---
I‚Äôm almost certain the jump from rock bridge to the ledge with the chest is impossible on a warlock. Very doable on titan for sure, don‚Äôt know about hunters. 
---

Also, as far as grinding cores goes: the more you play, the more items you get. The more items you get, the more shards you get. Shards trade for cores. Items also dismantle into cores. Item also dismantle into scrapper bounties. Scrapper bounties give cores. Spider offers bounties that give cores. 
---
That‚Äôs a lot of farmable cores there bud.
---
Oh god the flinch oh god oh shit oh fuck. 
---
God I don't even wanna think about how hard the structuring on malfeasance must have been in printing
---
Wanna get not forgotten because I don‚Äôt like the recoil on Luna‚Äôs it feels unnatural 
---
Because it tells you in the very beginning of the game that they can be made heroic. 
---
Frame that shit up. Michael's, if you have one nearby always has great prices and sales on nice poster frames

that‚Äôs impressive

You‚Äôre trust will never ever 3 tap someone, LH and NF are the best HC because of magnificent howl perk

It's very easy on hunter with stompees, not sure about without

AHHHHHHH THIS IS SO TRUE

Hi everyone, 
---
Finished Curse and Warmind stories now... Tempted to give the raid/raid lairs a go now or would you suggest cracking on into Forsaken? 
---
He might be crying because of that.
---
You have a chance for legendaries with heroic. Normal ones dont have any chance to drop a legendary 
---
Lmao
---
Check the collections tab for it, it tells you how it drops. 
---
Except the knife is shit and I'd rather have a one hit melee charge. 
---
I‚Äôm with ya man
---
Im not justifying cheaters. Im trying to draw a line between gaming the system and downloading aimbot.exe . Just like 4 stack dodging and titan skating is also "gaming the system". Whats more childish than ur insults is ur iq.  
---
You can certainly cheat and use m&amp;k on consoles. It's a big problem at higher ranks.
---
Literally one of the only things I‚Äôm missing for Dredgen. I have just died inside
---
It's not easily accessible.
---
The Cabal excavation isn't, some random ship behind you needs to be shot down
---
The mercury one isn't. 5-10 seconds after the mini boss is killed a crystal appears in the other direction of the teleport. If you run the event you turn around as soon as the boss it's killed and you never SWE that crystal.
---
The only two good, intuitive ones is the vex zone thing and blight thing

...I‚Äôm not looking for a group to raid with. 
---
My husband said he wanted to raid when he got home and this popped into my head üòÇ
---
Thank you for the information though!
---
You killed 10 enemies invading with super? 
---
bygones has way more range, if they are 3 tapping you let them get too close. 
---
They should make a South Park Ski emote. Come at me with that bullshit and you‚Äôre gonna have a bad time
---
I have to kill one more, then the sparrow and then the shell 
---
What game is this?  this is not destiny 2?  this does not belong on this sub.
---
Yea, but I know this guy is using controller for a fact. 
---
This is me except fighting lion, and west of sunfall seven and lucky boots 
---
They probably have a super already, too, though.
---
Wait what I thought that was something you could pick up it looks so real
---
Yes. I try that. Its also very good. Sometimes you get killed. Sometimed you dont get killed. Spectral blades have lots of extra resilence. You can also punch them to death inside ward of dawn bubble. 
---
Ok good tip, thank you guardian!
---
My buddy and I started playing D2 last year and leveled up together all 3 chars, he watched me get exotic after exotic while leveling, and even throughout forsaken. We start raiding and he gets 1KV and anarchy and all the curated rolls within his first 5 clears... While I'm sitting at 30+ and no 1KV ... It was rough for him watching me get lucky while we leveled up and it was annoying for me as well seeing him get the raid loot so early! RNGzus is a harsh master!
---
It does not have to be 3 resets in one season though. So get 1 or 2 done this season then finish next season.
---
I still report them on principle, but I dont care in rumble. 
---
Seeing as how I play 8 hours a week &amp; im in the top 25% for play time, simple math will tell you that the average player ( which wouldn‚Äôt be in the top 1/4th of time played ) doesn‚Äôt even play 8 hours a week. My play time has not fluctuated either. I‚Äôve been pretty consistent with how much I play for the entire time that I‚Äôve been playing D2 because I work &amp; only have so much free time. I‚Äôm not going off of people I play with. I‚Äôm going off the stats provided by whatever that site is that tells you how much play time you have. 
---
It‚Äôs sparrow racing league from destiny 1 you obviously never played D1 and experiences this lmao 
---
You're pathetic. Nobody's buying your line of bullshit. 
---
Was quite a grind just for the first reset, which I just got yesterday. Not sure if it‚Äôs worth it anymore
---
I use that same exact lost sector for the frames. Thanks for lettin me know about this trick
---
I just friended out about 10 more on two characters and NOTHING. For fucks sake this is infuriating.
---
I think someone made the hand cannon cadye used into a real good that fires 50 call bullets
---
Yea, they are all too busy getting head from ur mom.
---
That is what is called the traveler ball. You get it by kicking these different colored balls into different sections of the tower. Just go onto YouTube and search up ‚Äúhow to spawn the traveler ball in destiny 2‚Äù for more info. 
---
Right. Always get those mixed up. Flotsam is the dolphin, jetsam is the shark. One is floating debris and the other has washed ashore.
---
Is he a barren?
---
This would have been so much better if it was a shader and not an armor set.
---
Isn‚Äôt it also a rule to not insult other people using profanity? I mean if you are going to complain about the rules wouldn‚Äôt it be smart to follow them yourself? 
---
Over 40 clears of LW and still no 1k voices. I feel your pain 
---
Feels bad man :/
---
Give on the field, bring a sword!
---
Not good tho
---
well I guess its time to grind savathun's song until reset so I can never get the drop
---
Looks to me like the spring forward off the pole with his hands sends his body mass forward enough to get to the next ledge and that the "double jump" he does is just him putting his feet down and pulling them up to look like a jump. 
---
That armor with my taken shotgun and sword from D1 was primo. 
---
Add that to My and you'd be one good-looking Taken Boi.
---
The base game has an option to buy the expansions in it, but I think buying the dlcs separately and buying the dlcs with the game are the same price.   
---
If you play on ps4 let me refer a friend you.
---
The titan can heal a great deal with Reversal.
---
look both ways that thing will come from behind you somehow
---
This game needs some kind of Transmog/Glamour system. There‚Äôs a ton of beautiful sets of armor but the stats on them are garbage for today‚Äôs standards
---
Yeah I know all of that, and I‚Äôm not screwing with anything important. I‚Äôll be just adding a shell on top of the normal gun, and I‚Äôll test it before actually holding it and firing lol
---
that looks better then the ingame model, good job
---
I ran LW for the first time with one other brand new guy and a few sherpas. Took us about 4 hours with a huge hang up at Shuro in the last phase and then the Queenswalk. I totally pooped the bed on that one. Make sure you understand that last section because I couldn't for the life of me wrap my head around it until after we completed it and I watched a few more videos.
---
Literally me
---
It's all fun and games until someone uses a single piece outside of the set
---
It's not as easy to use and I people think, but keep using it and you'll figure it out. 
---
Why thank you! I‚Äôm probably going to add a better strap because this one was just electrical tape.

no problem. And for electrical tape that still looks really good
---
[Was expecting something a little different...](https://youtu.be/ucjwnPRicQw?t=167)
---
Hey it‚Äôs me ur clan mate
---
With very limited throw range and a charge time. Titans just have to sprint and bam...kill. Hunter doesn't even get the opportunity to have a 1-hit melee. Poor Cayde...he'd be so sad to know about this.
---
As long as they change the titan airplane helmet to a different design then yeah
---
It is now.
---
Titans have barricades, which provide either quick cover from heavy fire to take a break or allow you to go full Rambo with rally barricade and any full-auto power weapon.
---
Sunbreakers are long range artillerists with great damage potential.
---
Strikers are the best at punching everything until it dies.
---
Sentinels are surprisingly durable and are capable of shielding allies from heavy fire.
---
Warlocks have rifts, which provide either lasting damage buff or health regen for the team.
---
Dawnblades are focused on extreme mobility in combat, with ability to deal damage even mid-flight
---
Voidwalkers are the most damaging warlock subclass, having insane damage potential.
---
Stormcallers have very lasting roaming super and have some useful tricks.(honestly, stormcallers is my least used subclass)
---
Hunters have dodge, which either could be used as quick reload or dodge manuever.
---
Gunslingers are the most damaging hunter subclass, rewarding good aiming skills.
---
Night Stalkers have some nasty tricks like suppresing abilities and supers or going invisible.
---
Arctriders are melee-focused hunters with ability to survive in close range, either with raw melee strength or deception.
---
Each class and subclass are unique in their own way - i would recommend to eventually try out all of them, but Titan would be the best choice for newbie.
---
Aeon Guantlets
---
I was looking for how to get a title like that, but I don't like how it cuts out your view from seeing the shins of your character. It should've been above the character or something.
---
That kinda happened to me in iron banner, it took forever to load and loaded into an end screen with just my name but the team had won so I got rewards for it. 1 of which was an actual new exotic
---
Yeah I gave it a few passes with a gunmetal color to highlight the edges and make it match up with the rest of the gun. 
---
Do you know why it's so different? 
---
Could be. I dunno. Just a joke. 
---
Its just as ez now. 
---
Those snipes would be the same. They were quick snappy before getting shot. 
---
Shooting through 3 head shots was removed and needed to be. 
---
Why would you want to be Taken?
---
I was joking. I only play D2 for the pvp and I suck now with shotgun meta.
---
I can‚Äôt tell you the number of times I‚Äôve been killed by telesto, I now understand how much the community hates it
---
1000 like, feels good
---
There aren‚Äôt enough players to make separate playlists.  Sadly that‚Äôs the truth.
---
How was anyone supposed to deduce that?
---
Im sorry but i find that very ugly for a titan. That's just me tho
---
Both are solid options. I‚Äôd say queensvreaker has a slight edge for invasion kills while sleeper is better for general play and boss damage. 
---
The main difference comes in from the aim assist. Queensvreaker requires a crit to kill but you just have to be aiming in their general direction to get that. It also has a much faster charge time. Sleeper got its aim assist needed courtesy of how much it dominated gambit so you need to actually hit them now but it can also be a body shot. Primeval damage isn‚Äôt even a competition, sleeper 100%. 
---
If you are focused mostly on invasion kills, go queens and setup a good super for boss damage. Otherwise go sleeper. 
---
SO DID I!!!!!!
---
But the damn social anxiety wont let me.....
---
Not really. All the enhanced armour sets usually have limited drops per week. You could farm a ton of activities in the dreaming city but it would be slow, ineffective, and I'm honestly unsure if it would drop enhanced without being powerful gear 
---
Some ppl like a challenge
---
Not me, of course... I stick to pve :) But some ppl do
---
It‚Äôs a thing to pay for carries to get the gun.
---
Mine has masterworked range, outlaw and rampage with a rampage mod. &lt;3
---
I call it a shoe box despite the fact that I love this gun. 
---
Collar says fred lol
---
Yes but what I‚Äôm saying is my main character has no milestones but my second and third does and the second and third have the same ones showing, crucible should show up, flash points should show up 
---
Well in the competitive playlist I‚Äôd say about 90% of the players are decent at the game and 100% can shotgun. He‚Äôd probably be dead 
---
It‚Äôs just not good enough for an exotic. And the non exotic perk is just not too good in my opinion 
---
I came here for this comment. 
---
Holy shit I just realized the tangled web armor is that armor... For titan at least. I don't play much hunter or warlock so I wouldn't know
---
Literally everyone goes through this
---
Bro that‚Äôs sick
---
people said that jotunn reminds them of a toaster. i decided to make it real. im the execution not the jury

But HOW?!
---
These are awesome.  Can you do one that is like an engineering blueprint one with a Clovis Bray border?
---
Duolingo taught me more than my Spanish 1 teacher üòÇ
---
Really appreciate the reply, gonna have a read over this shortly and reply with something more thoughtful.
---
Im at work right now friend :) I can see you're comment is well thought out so speak soon!
---
So .... just to clarify..... do I need powerful frames or radiant as I've done near to 25+ bergusias and not a sausage nada niets nichts nothing....@√ó#$%% RNG
---
The only problem with this is almost no one else in the Destiny app has any patience. Meaning, if you've watched the video and have somewhat of an idea of what to do but you don't know 100% on every encounter, people will be dicks and boot you.  
---
Sorry, rule #5 :/ love the clan name though!
---
Great, now that song will be stuck in my head until I play Saints Row 2. Sounds like I will spend the evening driving around Stillwater
---
These are dope, they could be eververse rewards.
---
I never had cat issues on console. Been doing PC more now and my fat cat loves to lay on the mouse cord leaving me a very short bit of cord and limited mouse movement range. Drives me nuts, happens at least a few times during every session
---
I'd buy this as a toaster and set it in my room as a centerpiece. I'd be crunching on toast in style.
---
I honestly liked that they reused the set, because those sets were from the Prison of Elders activity (which was an endgame thing in D1). So I felt like it was a little nod back to D1 players now that PoE is back in the game, although in a different capacity. 
---
Quickfang and Crown Splitter are class swords. Quickfang for hunter and Crown Splitter for titans. I'm assuming they wanted to make them unique in comparison to other legendary swords. 
---
Yeah I heard, but i hope they really make some cool modes or changes. 
---
So by ur logic, titan skating is also cheating. Hmmm
---
I remember waiting for cool down on skolas fight trying to take him down with gjally
---
"My friend is gone!" ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä
---
A few to be sure. I misspoke (and misspelled) .
---
While this set is cool and all, one of the people I played with wore the pants of this set + a black shader, and from far enough away I kept mistaking him for an enemy. 
---
This.  I got hatemail from a player the other day cause i was using Jotunn to murder him over and over: 
---
‚ÄúNo skill weapon pussy‚Äù 
---
I just replied that he was right but so was every other weapon in the game with stacked perks...
---
Did the same thing 2 weeks ago and it wasn‚Äôt a issue. Did the rule change? Sorry though. Can you direct me to the exact place it goes
---
Whaat! Thats awesome!
---
Thank you! 
---
Why do people gravitate to dust rock in pvp all the time? Seems kinda meh
---
So to be clear - did you have a powerful frame
---
Or did you have a radiant frame in your inventory 
---

No issues, I will make due with my free last word stl.
---
Try doing ada ones augmented weapons I got one to drop with outlaw kill clip. The extra perk spot gives you a better chance at one. Granted it‚Äôs still not the best odds and only a once a week thing but better than nothing. 
---
Trust or Drifter cooking pot.
---
Unpopular opinion: Having exotics not have the ability to use any shader, and instead having ornaments that completely change the look of the gun, leads to cooler, more complex designs.
---
Graviton Lance is a great example, do you want it shaded, or to have a mini universe inside your gun.
---
I think Bungie would patch that in with enough demand, at the cost of new ornaments. They always choose the route with less work involved if given the choice. 
---
2.5k? As in budget 4k?
---
For example on light.gg it ahiws the hidden stats for skyburner‚Äôs oath are 20 zoom, 60 weapon size, 100 recoil direction and 90 aim assistance
---
That clip always makes me laugh
---
‚ÄîWhisper of the Worm
---
  It is crucial at some bosses, such as Morgeth in last wish or the Scourge final boss. But shotgun alternative is doable if your team is ok with it.
---
  I suggest you practice the parkour yourself and then go do it with LFG groups, it‚Äôs a lot easier than solo.
---
‚ÄîIkelos shotgun
---
  It‚Äôs quite important for multiple bosses or majors you have to kill (e.g. knights in vault of last wish) but I honestly think in most situations a random full auto shot gun would not be a detrimental disadvantage for your group. It would also be easy to LFG, and there is probably no way to solo it.
---
‚Äîcluster bomb rocket
---
  Sadly this is a definite must have, because no one wants to run through Riven normally. Good news is any rocket works. There is a blue rocket launcher the Cupbearer which can serve as a last resort. 
---
‚Äîa good add clear weapon
---
  Not really a must have but makes your life a lot easier. Generally you will want a pulse/auto rifle or a hand cannon with drop mag/outlaw/feeding frenzy + rampage. Blast furnace is a nice one and easy to farm, breakneck is amazing, you just need to grind some gambit, midnight coup from leviathan raid is good if you can find groups.
---
interesting..
---
Do I really need to explain how eyes work?
---
Lol, yeah I found that out soon after posting, I hope they bring it to other platforms soon.
---
How about a shader that let's us do this to any set? I don't exactly like that gear.
---
Watched game. Immediately found the real issue.
---
