FYI: After you finish this forge, you'll need to kill vex for the third forge clue. Stay on nessus

Either way your imput is welcome. I also agree with you.
---
I call it aimbot
---
How where why?
---
Because they think they're better than everyone else since they have a following
---
If you are looking to find a game that bends 100% to hardcore then you will never find one, the hard core is a loud minority however the "pethetic casuals" are where 90% of the sales are.  Any developer with a brain will add stuff for the hardcore but will still make sure the 90% are good because they would rather lose 10% sales next time not 90%.
---

---
I saw elsewhere someone suggest what may have been a perfect middle ground. Make puzzle a "secret quest" apart from the forge itself. Also, saw someone say niobe had 14 children who were killed by arrows. If so, there really better be checkpoints.

Gameplay?

Last Word has never been a PvE weapon. I highly doubt it‚Äôll be viable in any sort. As the comment below me mentions, hip fire would more than likely increase ROF.

I used it and nothing seemed to happen

Is it a heavy weapon? Did it drop without you forging a powerful frame?

Sorry, your submission has been automatically removed.

It appears you are asking a question about LFG/Clans, or help in-game.

Please post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/89vbwr/official_lfg_megathread_version_20/?sort=new) instead, look at the LFG dropdown menu on the top bar of the subreddit for various LFG tools, or check the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/8ji06r/official_faq_please_read_before_posting/) for possibly helpful advice on how to find people to play with our advertise/find clans.

I keep the 650 tigerspites for infusion fodder and binned the rest. Got one god roll that was fun to use for a while but I just use breakneck

This aged poorly

"First of all, much respect to those who are actually putting in HOURS to solving these puzzles."  Sorry, these are not puzzles as the solution to 6 was arbitrary with no intuitive design to lead to the problem being solved. 
---
I'm considering this a troll until there is proof that it has actually dropped, not just the details screen.
---
They used those exact words lol.  It's somewhat of a meme now [https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/ae71gy/twitch\_chat\_during\_niobe\_labs\_streams/](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/ae71gy/twitch_chat_during_niobe_labs_streams/)

I agree there's a few things Bungie could have done better, but it was their first time trying something new and there was no way to test something of this scale.  Overall it was immersive and fun for a few hours, which I believe is what they wanted.  They just didn't expect Stage 6 to take 16+ hours.
---
I do believe it is a special weapon
---
Many people are saying that it dropped from bergusia, so i guess it's true
---
Go to Ada, you can trade it in for radiance - a buff for forge weapons
---
It's an early drop, but not the first. There are a few posts before yours
---
No woosh, just a bad attempt at humor.
---
As a strike you can select it from the dreaming city and as a nightfall you can re-select it from the vanguard section of your director if that‚Äôs what you mean üëç
---
Yo I'm down as fuck you can do it with 6 people 
---
I don't even bother. I'll do the heroic adventure and a PE while I'm there, then come back later in the week once it resets haha. 
---
Yep...
---
If you want proof you're going to have to search his stream for it. Idk what time they started so I have no idea how far into the stream it happened. It was around the time they began saying they were done with words and letters. Like 9/9:30 est
---
How do you do it with 6 people ? üòÇüòÇ
---
When you're coming in theres one in the very back under the floor and on a pillar and the other one when youre coming in is on the right on the left pillar.
---
I'm not saying bend to hardcore mentality. Im saying that there is now literally nothing to play. Now that all of the grubby little casuals... You included im guessing... Get their hamds on the forge without doing any work whats the point? Might as well just given the weapons and armor fdom this dlc to eververse and sold it for silver. No one takes any sense of accomplishment in what they do. Its i want it now! (Screams until beet red and stamps foot)
---
Sweet, thanks.
---
Wait what?? I dropped at the start of the game when I saw I was put against a 4 stack probably two dozen times while grinding breakneck and never got more than a warning saying I was "disappointing the drifter"
---
You just have them join you like a raid. It's a glitch and I think they just left it 
---
When your angry "MAXIMUM TEMPER"
---
Just complete the forge again.
---
my friend got it from first completion of bergusia forge im not sure if you need a frame but he had one at the time
---
It should be fun and powerful at least. I don't want to use Last Word and keep thinking that I'm crippling myself by not using something else.
---
If you like this game so much, you REALLY shouldn't have bought another Xbox. Go experience it on pc, it's a much better experience, much smoother and everything pops a lot more. 
---
+1 for the title.
---
I‚Äôm not quite sure, but for me, it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs 180 rounds per minute. This is the fastest hand cannon I have seen so far (I started playing when Forsaken came out), there might be more around this rpm. Most hand cannons I come across are 140. 
---
I have a Trust with Zen moment, drop mag, and snapshot sight, it‚Äôs thus far a pvp boss. However, it kind of sucks in pve, for me.
---
4:30 Lake of Shadows
---
How was his eye-liner? ;)
---
Is it any good?
---
There was nothing wrong with the design.  The problem came from the difficulty.  The same problem most people had at the launch of Black Armory.  In this case the difficulty was from a different source (puzzle instead of power level).  I never thought Bungie was going to just leave us all locked out of it indefinitely.  Bungie has been looking for a way to engage both the casual and the hardcore players and leaving any further content for an expansion permanently locked behind an overly difficult challenge, be it power difficulty or puzzle difficulty, just doesn't fit that mind set. 
---
Random drop from burgusia? 
---
The fun they have is more than a little
---
Wait...he said the same thing to me.
---
That could only mean one thing: I am you.
---
I'm assuming no, since heroic public events don't give more than regular public events. 
---
Lol
---
Jesus christ not last word again I thought I could escape its destruction if my flawless trials runs
---
yes, but i had a powerful frame on me when it dropped so its probably the same rarity as the le monarque
---
im testing it atm, it hits pretty hard... might be the new telesto for pvp
---
Just try to get a buddy to come help open it. Then they can leave if they want. It‚Äôs super easy with 2 people. It‚Äôs def a bitch with 1. 
---
Shards are fairly easy to come by nowadays. In a few hours of playing I get several legendary items to drop. Prior to Curse of Osiris everyone complained about there not being enough of a grind, they've since added a ridiculous grind for just about everything and now people hate it. It is what it is. Play the game alot for those that have the time and get rewarded or fall behind the power curve and play catch up when you can. Pretty much the only options you have now.
---
Sweet! Le monarque to me hasn‚Äôt seemed that rare, though. While grinding out like 6 frames of the hand cannon I somehow got that damn thing 3 times. Hoping my RNG isn‚Äôt all used up.. 
---
#THIS IS AMAZING!
---
What about heroic Strikes?
---
&gt;drop mag
---
&gt;revolver
---
wut
---
It's 650 power so yeah it dropped.
---
Did your friend have a powerful frame while doing the Forge ?
---
From what I can see OP jumped as they were at the end and that somehow dragged them backwards into the receiving gate, causing the game to keep them floating as if they were still mid launch gate.
---
Guess she couldn‚Äôt handle all the Guardians jumping up on her display cases
---
Two shield drones spawn on wave 2. Kill them, open chest once boss is dead. Get key
---
...I am seriously considering using my third slot to make another Warlock just to get them, now. Wow.
---
I see you too are a man of culture lol. Top three favorite gif/meme of all time  
---
[This will show you what you get from having the annual pass](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/47465), compared to people who only have the base game or who have Forsaken but not the annual pass. 
---
It cannot be that hard to shelve your favorite gear until max lol, I‚Äôve done this every light increase and had more than enough enhancements cores to make all of my favorite pieces max light. Also, if you don‚Äôt care about perks on pieces than why even stress the fashion? Like, if you REALLY love the prodigal armor set you‚Äôre going to end finding some max light parts by the time you reach the end. I‚Äôve just never understood the whole anger and stress of having to save up cores or grind out a new set
---
Your analogy isn't great because I *have* played Destiny - I've dumped a good bit of hours into it over the last couple months.
---
Also my opinion is partially formed from playing a good amount of PvP where I've been exposed to lots and lots of other players. And... most of them are terrible. Like, really terrible.
---
Here and there I'll run into someone who has a lot of time in the game and knows how to abuse really powerful weapons(Queenbreaker, thunderlord, etc) or skills and abilities(which is something I'm lacking because I've played one class and straight up don't know much about how the other classes work) but I rarely run into someone that makes me think "Fuck, that guy is good".
---
Anyway, when I get the opportunity to try the end game content I fully intend to. And I'll be pleasantly surprised if it's actually hard. But it's tough to envision it as truly difficult when you're talking about a game that literally aims/redirects your bullets for you.
---
They should have just dropped a clue. 
---
Wrong. Heroic 5%, regular 2.5%
---
People were waiting for a grind tied to RNG? What kind of idiots would want that, oh wait...
---
You have to kill shield drones to get the key! Two span on wave 2
---
Right there with you - I started in mid/late November. There is SO MUCH... Especially if you are a completionist!
---
I‚Äôm mean i literally just dismantled a vouchsafe and got both a finest matterwave and an enhancement core. It really isn‚Äôt that hard to save up cores anymore 
---
Ya some people just get way too salty, I got a bunch of messages from a guy after a control match calling me a noob for camping... in control.
---
The Zenobia‚Äôs blast radius bar is big, or you can visually see the explosion is big? Because the different weapon archetypes have different base stats, and the stat bars use those base stats as sort of ‚Äúzero‚Äù if that makes sense. So like a rapid-fire gun, even with a high impact stat, will never do quite as much as an adaptive or actual high-impact.
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying. Also you can do spiders bounties on all three characters, which nets you a big heap of cores. People just love to complain about not being able to drag their one favorite set through the whole game. 
---
I guess I'm out of the loop too. Niobe...Destiny...are the Destiny games set in the same universe as the Matrix??
---
You see the way mine goes simple. Punch it. Everything i see gets punched. Including the map
---
I guess it depends on what the answer is, but it would have been an interesting ongoing news story if no-one could crack it.
---
Most likely not
---
It's really based on opinion of the person playing Destiny. But judging of what you said, make sure you have the Annual Pass that unlocks Black Armoury, Joker's Wild and Penumbra DLC. If you do, have a shot at replaying Destiny 2, you'll face 2 Raids that can be easily be accompanied by other players, Shattered Throne, new exotics that fills exotics, forges and powerful legendary gear (Threat Level eg). If you're not into the grind, then probs not worth going back in, as well as not owning the Annual Pass.
---
Did you complete it?
---
I got it on my first clear. A fusion rifle that hits like a grenade launcher. One hits Invaders in Gambit at range with special ammo. Not mad about that.
---
I understand there is a new forge out, but what is the point of it? What do you even forge at the new forge? 
---
Thank you
---
I just hate that it was only 1 day before they cracked...
---
Man I hadn't thought about it like that,, and I'm glad you made that point. You're right.
---
It brings to mind that there's a lot of peripheral stuff that I think would be better if it was included in the game itself. Stuff like clan creation and controls, and LFG.
---
I have enjoyed everything, but I can definitely see others point of view now. 
---
If it was from last week the game bugs out and thinks it's a powerful frame
---
The printer is from Prusa i3 MK3  and we got all the filiments from ali Express 
---
My brother adjusted all the settings himself so i don't know i just help smooth the parts with sandpaper or paint and assembling them 
---
It looks better cause we used wood filler to fill the gaps between the lines than smoothing them with sandpaper 
---
You probably do

Expanding on this, it was suggested by an undercover dev in Twitch chat trying to speed things up, and Datto called him a "small brained moron".  16+ hours later, a team who wasn't Datto or Gladd (the two streamers the devs tried to directly help, since they had X0,000 viewers and the devs wanted to create an exciting moment for the most viewers) managed to do exactly what was suggested and of course it worked.
---
No glitch, just the only primary I use.

why would it be a glitch? i have 60k on mine

Holy shit seeing that name again just brought back PvP meta nightmares

ikelos sniper is the only sniper than can hit several targets at once with bodyshots, but any sniper can overpenetrate on headshots

The most pointless barricade in the game, all it does is force you off your sparrow for 1.2 seconds before you summon another one.  I know that's your point with Ada but it still irritates me.
---
 More ammoes  
---
 Faster shootins   
---
 Aim assist feels great, dunno if it actually is but I got one with   
---
 full bore + drop-mag + dragonfly + rampage and with a backup mag can hold 12rnds and in pvp (especially in control where all the frenemies bunch up) dragonfly hits hard.  In pve, it destroys ads (or used to, but not as much as the huckleberry these days).  
---
  To explain, I never liked hc's and when I did the Mars (ikelos) stuff I resented using the hc they force on us. But the Trust changed all that.  
---
Niobe Labs is a new location in the EDZ that was originally intended to be the opening quest for the final forge of Black Armory. It was made as a puzzle-solving challenge and consisted of waves of enemies, each followed by a minute-long timer where you needed to input the correct sequence or you wiped, starting back at level 1. After 27 hours (last I checked) nobody had been able to move past level 7.

It‚Äôs pretty bonkers honestly.

The leader of the clan I'm in has close to 30 completions and still no 1k voices. He guided me through the whole raid, my first completion, 4 days ago. I got 1k voices from my very first chest. 1st time completing it, very first chest. 
---
I didn't know how lucky I had been until they started to mention that it's a bit of am ongoing gag within the clan that he always guides people to 1k voices but can never get it himself. 
---
Or any other activity with some replay value. An emblem and a ghost seems to be the new 2 tokens and a blue. 
---
Same but with bellowing giant üòÇ
---
Most fun I ever had in D1 was going through and clearing every raid with 6 TLWs. PvE viability and PvE fun are two wholly different things.
---
Since The Corrupted has only been the nightfall once before, I doubt sufficient people have farmed it so far to say *for absolutely certain*, but many people think the ghost **only** comes from ascendant challenges, the sparrow **only** comes from the weekly quest, and the ship **only** comes from the Shattered Throne. There are people who say they got those from other activities in the Dreaming City, but the number is very small. 
---
I highly doubt you can get anything besides normal strike drops and Horror's Least from The Corrupted. 
---
Well it's pretty insane when other developers get a suggestion and implement the suggestion in-game that week, and Bungie can't even address game breaking mechanics for 6 months.
---
can armor drop if i complete it without a weapon frame?
---
folks joke but nothing beats the look on a cabal's face when you put your fist through their high ranking officer's face, the sound as you cave in a knight's skull, the feeling of crushing a vex juice box center, the smell of the escaping ether  of a fallen when you pop his head off
---
You can get this from Ikea
---
did the whole thing. ogres, and knights, and witch oh my

You gotta wait till the next big sandbox update jan. 28th for them to fix it.

I know its stupid, cause i wanted a new roll on my bow but fuck me right?

Random guardians sound nicer than your clan mates, Fancy a move Guardian?

Thanks

He mostly makes videos on end game and late game activities, but Esoterickk is my favourite Destiny youtuber. His videos are always only as long as they need to be. Datto is pretty good and he has guide videos, but I do not believe his base game Destiny 2 guides are up to date with changes that Forsaken introduced. 
---
It's surprisingly hard to find early game guides because pretty much none of them were updated over time. I think this subreddit and /r/destinythegame are pretty good sources of information. 
---
It ain‚Äôt even that good, either that or I have no idea what or how to use it 
---
Thanks for the heads up. Enjoyable read, got a few chuckles out of it
---
I don't know maybe with that thing you buy from Ada that or do 2 powerful frames 
---
Make sure you post on r/raid ecrets 
---
The raid pulse, the inaugural address is amazing!
---
Don‚Äôt worry, the stats always looked bad even in D1.  This thing will be a monster in crucible, especially at shutting down shotgun rushers.
---
Man just shave it all off! Rock the Heisenberg!
---
Out of all the raid sets so far, in D2, I like Leviathan‚Äôs the best. Especially the prestige version
---
Is that what comes from the mysterious box? 
---
No. You need to complete matches in the top 2 or have a 1.5kda or better. If you stand still for 10 seconds, you loose credit. If you suicide once you loose credit. And so on. Instead of people hopping in and leaving shit matchmaking, they would see their team moving and fighting to gain credit. Effort. And likewise more often than now do the same. All I hear people doing and see via pts numbers is folks looking at comp, then not going back. What it is now is a loosing formula. Asked your super skilled friends, and they would have no clue.
---
Yes, it is!
---
Yes, it only drops from completing dailies unfortunately 
---
This is not the same post, but some guy i did the Bes forge with got it.
---
You dont have to solo it. Try to lfg for a tem.
---
Thanks for the help. I‚Äôll be sure to check all that out üëç
---
How is it? I just got Jotunn and I love the shit out of it
---
It is completely random. Has nothing to do with the specific chest you open
---
What he said \^ ;)
---
go to edz volundr forge area, look to the left of the bridge gap, drop down into a cave to loot a box which contains the mysterious box quest.
---
New forge was locked behind a puzzle. People have been working on it since reset Tuesday but I think got stuck on level 7. A vocal part of the community was upset they couldn't do the new forge until the puzzle was done so they are opening the forge anyway.
---
I would lie if I would claim I never used, of course there were times we just wanted a easy nightfall and get over with it. But most of the time I went solo I actually fought the boss :p
---
you madman
---
Its random drop from forging just like exotic bow?
---
I want it very bad :)
---
I did that and have three keys unlocked. Any other steps??
---
Hopefully they bring back thorn
---
I did unlock the three emblems on the first character  I ran the new forge quest on. Is it a requirement to unlock fourth forge?
---
But any forge? or specific?
---
Ah
---
Intersting. You can also do max damage with whisper. 
---
Goes through floors too , got blasted while I was on top of the overhang\ledge and the player underneath blasting my teammate to smithereens.
---
How so I have classmates that have jobs and family they have done the same. How exactly am I a liar?
---
Last boss of Shattered Throne you can get a damage buff after killing the knights.
---
Even whisper does 999,999 the damage cap.
---
so many hours of sweat.... Has to kill 5 invaders
---
Outlaw/Rampage. Sometimes with explosive payload, it doesn‚Äôt count as a precision kill, basically voiding outlaw all together. 
---
The actual unlock sequence is still available for rewards tho, so you can still do all the steps technically 
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say that... I mean they‚Äôve been add it with no sleep for a day. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôd be pretty pissy
---
Dudes been rebooted 6 times and still somehow manages to die. Smh

Basically my point was this:
---
If you don't like the post, down vote it and move on. 
---
The bar that fills up at the bottom of your screen? If so that's your level bar. Shows you how far along to the next level you are.
---
Well damn not even worth it if it's just a sniper rifle. Waste of an exotic
---
More punchy pleasee
---
I completed this strike twice and it didn‚Äôt drop for me. Anyone else have this issue?
---
Okay, didnt realize that, as I am 50.
---
PVP is now only 4v4 in the competitive playlist. And micro transactions have and will always be purely cosmetic. The PvP of Destiny is different from any other game and comparing it to another would be an insult. It is in its own way a different game from your traditional FPS. I believe you might get angry at first if you get stomped by a six stack with the Not Forgotten (Broken Ass Gun) but, if you invest time you can become great. I always recommend Destiny 2 for any hardcore players. 
---
he be dummy thicccccccc
---
What armor is that?
---
I also got the SMG I wanted badly cause I love the peacekeepers. It has zen and kill clip. And an orchid with quick draw and ex rounds. Great for fighting lion combos
---
I don't think it was solved. Bungie just opened the forge for everyone (bypassing the puzzle).
---
If it was solved, can you link the answer to the level 7?
---
I got the exact same Problem dude you are not alone :)
---
damn do i think it's bug? or purpose?
---
I pretty sure people are still trying to solve level 7, though bungie just released the 4th forge because it was taking too long for people to solve it. The first clear is still up for grabs
---
nah
---
After I punch all the things, I eat some crayons 
---
When you get decent with it, it actually can be kinda beastly. Especially since it uses primary ammo. Amazing for ad clearing (particularly if you have armor perks that let you switch weapons fast), and it can be decent in pvp especially on maps where you can bounce it around corners or into tunnels
---
Yeah I realised that after I posted it
---
How does one acquire this new weapon?
---
I will literally facepalm you with my magic space hand
---
Dont you dare assume that I dont know how to do the Last Fish raid.

how much time do you you need for the dungeon? Me and a friend of mine did our first completion last night, we had 2:03h, i'm just wondering by how much we could reduce the time.

google.com is this cool new website that can answer almost any question you have! Try it out!

Try to contact bungie ?
---
Yeah fair enough but thinking about most of the exotics out there are so obsolete by their own, which could be fixed with synergies from other exotics like the stag for warlock, haven't seen anyone use that but think about it with lunafactions, would make it like a lifesaver in certain situations, just an example.
---
But yeah makes sense what you're saying
---
I'm a tad bit confused. 
---
Auto loading rift/barrier.  Situations where ammo and reloads aren't the limiting factor, pure DPS is.  There's plenty of moments like that.
---
If it's because of the bow dont worry so am I
---
I've killed Raven like 30 times bro

How do u get the bounty for that gun again?

Wtf is all this poodiepie stuff about?

Excuse me, but the boss is called given and if you did it 30 times, why hasnt it dropped the wisper for you?

Are you past light 500?

What if everything you ever wanted... WAS TO KICK SHIT IN THE FACE!? FOREVER! THEN YOU NEED PEREGRINE GREAVES!!!¬†

Yes that's why.

I can see it now.... some insane guy is gonna be running dual 180s, (Last Word &amp; Luna's or Not Forgotten) aka Me with Lucky Pants.
---
I have the same issue. Its really annoying.
---
I tried the repair game feature but after 10 minutes of scanning my game files it said no issues found... It really ruins my urge to play since it takes so long to boot up the game.

I don't think there's much they can do

I‚Äôd recommend D2. PvP has more than two game modes. Just two playlists. Aside from that I think its fun and right now it‚Äôs probably at its peak. Be prepared to sink a lot of time into PvE as well. That‚Äôs where the majority of the really cool guns are. There‚Äôs a new PvPvE mode in gambit as well that‚Äôs pretty competitive. 
---
I hope they keep on doing these exotic buffs like they did the whole year 2018. So more exotics become viable options. 
---
Well Titans 'special' form of melee attack ist the shoulder charge/kick, so it's alrdy there.
---
But yeah, would be cool to see something like that for hunters
---
TBH Crucible needs more love.
---
I actually got it yesterday. I even got the curated roll with rampage and kill clip. Do you?
---
checks new, sees this exact video with a similar enough title posted at least an hour before this, but this isn't a repost
---
top ke
---
Yes, but isnt the curated roll feeding frenzy and rampage?
---
Indeed but just picture the total havoc it would be to shoulder charge then use this ability in PvE!
---
Plus it would help titan create some distance in PvE, against thralls for example, even if the Titans are very 'upclose'.

Yea nice mate

Why are explodiebois so shiny and atractive to punch reeeeeeeehh

Im a titan that started just befor forsaken and i have show my friend the way of a titan main

The quickest would be to do the powerful engrams dailies/weeklies. Then create another Warlock character, transfer your highest level gear to that character and do the powerful engrams dailies/weeklies. Then again with a 3rd Warlock character.
---
thats not reposting
---
I believe its the same as Le Monarch. You have a chance to get it when completing powerful frames, so you get 2 chances a week

i'm 595 right now and the powerful engrams dailies/weeklies only dropped 582/3 for me...

Wow, seen as this has only just come out and I‚Äôm already in the post, why should I not ask? Presumably both gold frames but get in the bin guy

Watch Datto‚Äôs videos on YouTube, they‚Äôll explain the raids. Id recommend that you join up on a clan that‚Äôs active. If you‚Äôre thinking about doing a raids and don‚Äôt have anyone to play with LFG is a great resource.

If you‚Äôve got any questions about anything feel free to PM me

waves would be fine ;) the puzzles are a problem, or at least the 7th

It was a "small brain idiot" idea because of the fact that he tried his team all shooting tree from butterfly and it didn't work. No idea why maybe they had to shoot it a bit more but when you have to go through 20 minutes to input one or two things before wiping back to 1 I'm pretty sure he wanted to try as many things as possible and if he'd tried that idea once why try it again.
---
Does anyone know if a scout rifle is going to be added to BA?  I'm a little anxious for them to be viable again
---
Milestones including the spider bounty. Prioritize dreaming city. I hardly ever do raids and hit 650 a while ago. Drop rate for prime engrams was increased a short while ago, so that should help you too
---
Other than raiding, the only way to get powerful gear is from milestones, prime engrams, doing nightfalls and stuff with clan members for Hawthorne, and spider bounties. Once your power level is high enough to do forges, you can get 2 more pieces of powerful gear each week from Ada 1.
---
Do all the weekly milestones. I have never done a raid and until I hit 650... I only had one character. Playing a lot will get you there faster but doing the milestones will get you there. 
---
Everything else you've been doing to get past 500. Weekly and daily milestones and prime engrams. Prime engrams give you the biggest boost in light while weekly and daily milestones give smaller boosts past a certain light level. Not doing the raid every week is basically the same as not doing a few of the milestones for the week, although it does drop gear on par with prime engrams (meaning that they never soft cap based on what light level you are currently at.)

Thank you.

Bff I'm so tired of this kind of things. I played a lot during dawning but didn't see anything about this set.

 How would I have obtained it?

*solo blade barrage*

Pretty accurate
---
The forge isn't connected to the puzzle anymore. We can still run niobe labs for rewards, but I don't think anyone's gotten past level 7...not sure if there are more levels after that either.....
---
As a newer player, can I just say thanks to sherpas ? I definitely wouldn't have the time to learn all this stuff and raiding is definitely the best part of D2
---
I was getting mine from bright engrams. 
---
WHERE AND HOW IN THE NAME OF CRUCIBLE THIS THIS BABY DROP!?
---
im a pvp player. anything you say doesnt benefit me because i can definitely say that im an overall better player then you. im not being mainstream stating that niobe labs is tough, im just stating that since its easier then your lunas grind. drop the lunas grind and be world‚Äôs first for niobe lab. wait? can u? and no i am not insulting you. the post was not needed as a comparison for a pve puzzle (that hasnt been completed for nearly two days now) and pvp pinnacle weapon that most people have. 
---
I'm a warlock, but I'm all about punching everything. I think I'm secretly a titan...

Same here on my second character. I have all the keys from the first three forges. I am guessing it is a bug. 
---
Well then.....

You finally got the boots!?!? GG!
---
A friends of mine had the key from wishing well and helped us with running the heart, he hasn‚Äôt killed riven til this day but he had 1k from that key he had,
---
A more accurate portrayal would be that your gambit team needs to stand on specific spots and shoot specific letters and symbols in specific orders and using Google history to help solve it, just so you can attempt a round of gambit.
---
No they're not pitiful. They're the base stats. The range is actually 45 not 28 because of the barrel and magazine perks. 
---
We all need to stop spreading misinformation.
---
As a forge drop and you can buy them from Ada.
---
It does very little damage, but it puts a void explosive charge on them. Because spider tanks have like 20 hitboxes, they all get charges that explode within a second then get replaced. 
---
:( only 3 more chances for me this week as I run my last character through. Got the Corrupted gun yesterday so the ship is the last thing I need. 
---
Yeah, lol, first thing I thought as well. "Huh, sounds exactly like Destiny 2 year 1."
---
The chaperone does as much damage in one hit as an ikelos trench barrel hit. You just need to aim properly hahaha.
---
Blue engrams are called rare too, but those drop once every 30 seconds
---
So as a relatively new player, what makes a good Trust?
---
Im being stopped by not knowing what it is haha. 
---
I only just recently hit 50 and it seems like they are removing content before I can even get to it.
---
Lvl 30 boost, no more thunderlord quest... and now i dont get to try some kind of puzzle before its gone.. 
---
Return to Ada-1
---
You can tell it's a titan flowchart because it's made wrong. There's no operation leading down. :p
---
Well now I don‚Äôt have to get mountaintop
---
Ok, but as a drop can you get it from any Forge?
---
180s are fucking broken right now. Perfect in air accuracy, great handling, they're easy cannons.
---
What one is your favorite?
---
I've only gotten it from Bergusia.
---
Trust me, you want drop mag in that slot.  That speeds up the reloads plenty, gives you options for other perks since you won't need outlaw or feeding frenzy.  Range is plenty without a range increase stat.  So essentially you get to have snapshot/kill clip with a very snappy reload despite not having a major reload perk.  Stability is high enough to deal with, especially with a targeting adjuster mod.  Range is more than enough to deal with cross-map fights.  Magazine size is just fine, nothing massive for a 4burst but acceptable.  That leaves the masterwork for either reload or handling, and I can *honestly* suggest handling for a masterwork for once in my life. Higher handling is faster ADS and swap speed.  Both still fairly important in the crucible, just not as important as actually making your gun fight at solid ranges or reload fast enough.  But this roll already has those bases covered, so handling it is for me.
---
It seriously has it all dude, everything you could want from a gun.
---
Would recommend. 10/10. 
---
Have a great day too kind sir xxx
---
That's the reason I asked - I'm not sure but I think i received one for completing Gofannon forge. 
---
I personally like neutral game perks to increase the overall use of my weapon. So that why my god roll would be full choke, accurized, range me, slideshot, and snapshot
---
Get them catalysts my dude.. totally different feel to a ton of the weapons
---
It's acc really good. And it's never to late for it. Great story line. 
---
Hey, one last thing that may or may not help you, I have found Izanami to be the easiest forge to grind. Especially if you have a fireteam, but even if you don't it's pretty cake. I even two manned it last night with a random guy because our third dropped out 1 minute into the match.
---
Wait I thought this was the subreddit for destiny memes
---
So this isn‚Äôt a repetitive action in game to gain experience or in-game rewards?  Hmmm
---
Wait isnt blueberry just a term for random guardians on your minimap and not "lol noob" as you're somewhat implying?
---
Besides https://whereisxur.com/, https://www.niris.tv/ and KackisHD on YT, what else should I be looking at? Currently at 570 and there's still a lot I don't know.

---
TL;DR , but one thing right from the beginning: Why would you want to reach max level in a week or two. 
---
I think the level grind in the last season was really good - I played a lot for my taste and reached 600 2-3 weeks before Black Armory. 
---
The progression in the current season was too fast, I already reached max level without investing nearly as much as the season before.
---
What I'm trying to say is: Making everyone happy is hard - impossible even - so you have to see for yourself. If you can't live with the negativ things, then it is maybe better to move on. In the end, it is a game made for entertainment and fun. If you don't have either - look elsewhere.

Still haven't even done a forge. All the shit for the quests and exotic is just annoying and I'm just going to skip the whole thing. Black armory is pretty bad. 
---
&gt;what that means is that this game forces you to complete every last drop of weekly and daily content
---
They 100% do not do this...you dont have to do anything you dont want in this game.  While not doing things, you miss out on certain items, but not sure what good handing raid gear out for public events does for the end game.
---
I enjoy it a lot. 
---
I thought it meant like blue gear instead of purple.
---
Hopefully this helps 
---
https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Troubleshoot?oid=13610
---
I can‚Äôt tell if your joking or not.
---
Has to be a specific quest you pick up on IO, not the normal strike
---
Raids are content made for 6 people. Bosses in raids all have certain mechanics that you need to do to take them down, and puzzles that you need to solve to progress. They are a TON of fun. If you only have the base game, you have access to only the Leviathan raid. If you do have the DLC‚Äôs, I‚Äôd recommend finding a group of people that would be willing to help you through the Eater of Worlds raid. It‚Äôs short, good for beginners, and only a few people need to have a good handle on what is happening to get through it. The rewards won‚Äôt be good, but it‚Äôll be a nice starting point to introduce you to raids.
---
If you have any other questions about the game, I‚Äôll be happy to answer them!
---
I think youre mixing that up. Blueberry is just a random guy on your minimap (blue dot) hence the name. And Kinderguardian is some beginner.

I am asking fire rate is connected to the full auto perk

Ha! This made me laugh im the wrong place at a very inappropriate time

Why not both? Drop Mag + Kill Clip + Rampage is pretty insane. 
---
Jotunn is a tracking rocket launcher that you can get basically infinite ammo for using scavenger perks that can cross-map-insta-kill that's in your secondary slot
---
woah.

Gonna attempt to get Jotun after I got off work today. RNG don't fail me now
---

Hot damn that's nice!
---
I dont hate the milestone system in general I don't think, its more-so the rng behind the powerful engrams that annoys me the most. I loved the way milestones worked in vanilla. The rng adjustments is what annoys me in forsaken.
---
My advice? If you like the items of let's say Gambit more than the Crucible items, finish the Gambit milestones last so the gambit items will have the higher level
---
Regular engrams aren‚Äôt gonna give you power, those are just item drops. Sometimes you get something with good rolls, but lower power, keep it and infuse. The rest just scrap for shards. What you wanna go for is Petra‚Äôs weekly quests. Those are what will give you power. 
---
My friends who I ironically pulled out of ff14 are above 600 after 2 weeks. They don‚Äôt crucible, and don‚Äôt gambit, and only one have done the raid. It is entirely possible to do without grinding activities you aren‚Äôt interested in 
---
Ok that's cool, but I'm more flabbergasted by the shortcut

There is a gohost and an emblem but yeah that's barely an incentive

The sniper is from the box quest. The fusion dropped during a powerful frame in the new forge.

Nice! How did it drop?

The shotgun is the only IK weapon available this week.

that's what I'm saying. I've been doing that lost sector all wrong!

Just Bergusia.

What weapon is being talked about here? I everything and all I can see is something replacing telesto.
---
*I will pee on them all.*
---
Load into a nightfall solo, snipe away. I do it with those types of bounties quite a bit. 
---
have you got anarchy and 1k?
---
*I read
---
That'll probably always happen because I'm sure every streamer wants to world's first. Glad it's opened tho. I wasn't about to try and solve that shit lol 
---
They have to aim initially, much like the telesto
---
Very true.. It's just farming to get a orchid that is God rolled with that will take forever. Lol. I've only dropped the most useless rolls I've ever seen before. Shield disrupt and shield break... Like why? üòÇ
---
Yeah I've heard it's decent one shot damage, but is it worth the exotic slot? Is it worth taking off Thunderlord, whisper, sleeper, 1K etc. Will it have much of a place in the endgame?
---
It looks like it could be good in PvP for 1 shotting to the body, but you would need a couple boxes of heavy ammo for that to work. Maybe lack luster isn't the right word, but to me it feels like it's missing some other unique ability on its perk to help make it a more viable choice.
---
For example, what if you 1 shot kill an enemy it returns some ammo to the magazine? Or something like that. Because I feel the ammo consumption on this weapon is going to be the main issue.
---
Damn, it‚Äôs been so long I forgot what it looked like
---
How it works in PC is that your gun doesn't stick to the target, but the hitboxes are enlarged by your range and accuracy stats. 
---
Could've just edited your comment lol, but Jotuun, its a \*fusion rifle\* that launches a tracking rocket basically that one shot kills and burns the surrounding area/enemies
---
I feel like you crit at 0:28 after a clear miss, but that could be the view kick cover where the reticle is. Thanks ! 
---
Seems like every call for a nerf is followed by another item to be nerfed in a week. If I don't have OP weapons to chase the grind becomes not worth it imo.

Totally would love to see the problem eliminated first! But there will always be some times when this will happen. 
---
This all or nothing period you have to go through once you hit Legend is a PAIN. Yes I would love to not play 20 mins of game that will not improve my progress BUT that is the game... I think a lot of people backing out on a loss are also Legend trying to reset. They think this isn't going to be a win so I am out. (Maybe that is why I keep getting dropped in to matches. Matchmaking sees me as equivalent to the player that left?) Anyway... having a system where you get something if your teams wins a round (say 50 infamy) even if they don't win would help through this Legend To Reset wasteland. Most matches I play the team will win one round. 
---
Nice. Seems a better way to go
---
Idk where you got 60k people from but it was terribly implemented because it was for a niche part of the community that only a small portion was realistically going to attempt to solve, but it locked progression for everyone behind it. Even if it was 60k people, that‚Äôs no where near the amount of daily players. Not even 1/10th of daily players. That‚Äôs not how you get your player base to participate in or care about an event. Look at the percentage of people that have completed Raids. On PS4 it‚Äôs 2.1% for Last Wish. That‚Äôs not entirely due to there being puzzles in it, but it definitely speaks on how much people care for doing things that aren‚Äôt apart of the core gameplay of Destiny. Plus when you think about the fact that the reward for Niobe Labs being completed was to grind a forge..... Our reward was grinding. Destiny 2 already has a huge problem with rewarding people for the time they invest, &amp; having people wait all those hours to be rewarded with the ability to go grind a version of what they‚Äôve been doing for weeks was never going to go over well. It was all around poorly thought out &amp; implemented. They over estimated the ability of their players &amp; im honestly surprised people were attempting it for as long as they did.
---
It was spread across the Destiny sub reddits that we would need a rare bounty, I kept one completed rare bounty on my titan and warlock since last week due to the news drop.
---
Also, with the rare bounty being up to RNG, play through bounties on each character and the one that gets a rare bounty first, get's to play through Lock and Key.
---
This is a user error problem, tired of salty casuals wanting the game to be easy and then join the salty ranks of, "this game is incredibly shallow on content".

Mhomie, "constant nerfs and buffs"? You obviusly know nothing about this game. Pve? Whisper. 1k. Sleeper. Thunderlord. Prospector(but it was buffed so do you consider it ruined?). Merciless. Cluster rockets. Tatara gaze. Blast furnace. Long shadow. Telesto. Kindled orchid. Midnight coup. Huckleberry. Nation of beasts. Chattering bone. EP shotgun. Hammerhead. Threat level. Anarchy. Breakneck. Loaded question. Jotunn. The list goes on. PvP? Chaperone. Fighting lion. Claws of the wolf. Bite of the fox. Telesto. Luna's howl. Not forgotten. West of sunfall. Gunnora's axe (do you even know this one?). IKELOS_SMG. Dust rock blues. Jotunn. Nation of beasts. Sleepless. Retold tale. Twilight oath. Mountaintop. Redrix. Supremacy. Again, the list goes on.
---
What armor looks good?
---
Hunters? All iron banner sets. Dawning grips. Both ahamkara exotics. Celestial nighthawk. Leviathan. Reverie dawn. Last wish helm. Raiden flux. S4 and s5 eververse. Scrouge. Forge. 
---
Warlocks? Dawning. Ego talon. S4 eververse. Forge. Scrouge. Last wish. Crown of tempests. Eye of another world. Wings of sacred dawn. Prophet snow. Ophidian aspect. Leviathan.
---
Titans? Noble constant type 2. Reverie dawn. Last wish. Hallowfire heart. Scrouge of the past. Forges. Heart of inmost light. Helm of saint 14. Y2 crucible. Gambit. Leviathan. 
---
Do you play the game or.....
---
The third one is the hardest,  the fourth, even with its 650 requirement is WAY easier than the 3rd.
---
Risk Runner also shreds though everything there and the boss is simple to wreck with Whisper, Thunderlord, Sleeper.  Its just a spider tank with no shield.

It will be intresting to see how this forge plays after Jokers Wild launches and we are above the forges light level

Had more written but this discussion isn't really going very far. I will close with saying in reference to your "casuals are the wrong audience" comment... this game would not be around without casual gamer's. A very small amount of players are hardcore. Like super small. Many mmos have been killed from not giving enough content or catering to casual players in addition to hardcore players. If you want this game to survive,  feedback like I gave in my op is what needs to be considered. The only real thing that hardcore gamer's do for a game is if they are streamers to bring in views on what the game is like and possibly if they write guides or videos for the game. Otherwise, hardcore gamers are not doing much for the game community as far as player volume. Hardcore gamers are the minority, not the majority. Don't forget that!

*Doom fist voice changer:* ‚ÄúTry me‚Äù
---
Well... my first attempt at the forge had everyone leaving too. So I got my light up. Now I‚Äôm the one leaving. Only at Volundr though. If you go to any later forges, everyone has at a minimum done Volundr successfully.
---
and it promptly got nerfed? lol, your point?
---
better rebuttal: https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/aelyql/serious_leaving_exotics_opbroken_would_keep_the/ 
---
Start the quest as in not having the forges open or not getting the box? I didn‚Äôt have any of the keys on my hunter (the character I had a rare saved on,) only took like 30 minutes or so to go in and shoot the drones for max temper on each forge. Or is there something I‚Äôm not understanding?
---
I'm merely commenting on the irony of one person on reddit (for a video game) suggesting that another poster was not fun at parties. Shall we leave it at that?
---
It took me about 4-5 weeks to get to 647 I believe. Logging in for about 12-15 hours a week minimum for the dailies/weeklies. Unless the grind got massively nerfed I also find that hard to believe unless you are the worlds luckiest player as far as powerful engrams go. This was at forsaken launch btw. So with the logic of how long it would have taken me to get to the cap which I assume was 700 it would have taken me about 2 months+ to get to the max power level attainable without doing the raid. I wasn't willing to give the game another month of grinding since I was already at the threshold of doing the nightfall strike, which I did enjoy, so I quit the game because I already had a respectable loadout as well. I probably would have stuck around longer to find more weapons but I wrote in my next paragraph why I didn't.  
---
Honestly what really killed this game for me as well was the weapon affix revamp thing. I had collected nearly every weapon in the game at destiny 2 launch and most of the new ones in the dlc as well... then they redid the weapon affix thing and how it rolled weapons and never updated the old gear to the same standard so it essentially wiped out 200+ hours of grinding for those weapons. Kind of put a sour taste in my mouth. Our festival of the light gear also was never updated to have the new mods when I played which I spent countless hours getting and upgrading to the masterwork version and farming for the glow effect. I guess its just a multitude of poor decisions from bungie that have led to me leaving it. I could probably make a whole list but I made my op the most crucial ones because then id feel like I'm just whining instead of giving feedback. What a lot of it boils down to though is bungie not respecting peoples time with loot resets, grind aspects, etc. Like how the heck can they possibly charge for glow effects for festival armor and then a week later make it obsolete. Like that was the biggest middle finger I have ever seen a developer give to its fans. I couldn't believe that more people weren't complaining about it on reddit when it happened.
---
People have gotten so efficient at this. Feels like my strikemates are halfway to the boss before I can finish popping my Vanguard Boon.
---
I have no idea how key molds and multiple characters are supposed to work. 
---
My best advice is to do every one of Ada-1's bounties and complete the Bergusia forge, because those two activities seem to be where rare bounties come from. 
---
I'll either just wait for it to drop from one of the two weeklies which will take forever. Otherwise I'll have to lvl a total of 70 levels to get the other two characters up to 50, and I don't know which would be more painful. :/
---
There is absolutely no proof that there was an ‚Äúundercover dev‚Äù, does no one realize how crazy that sounds?
---
I don't believe he's done yet either. He said once Bungie unlocked it he would get some rest and keep trying. I'm not doing the forge until someone gets it.

Many people assumed it ends at seven levels because Bungie has always really liked that number. Seventh column, seven Seraphs, seven waves of Escalation Protocol, etc. 
---
Haha, I'm not sure what that is but that sounds like a typical ludicrous bungie grind step title if I ever saw one.
---
That trash talk is embarrassing. 
---
Thank you bro. 
---
Well that demonstration was about 1:10 too long.

I'm not sure what point you're making with how long it takes in CoD zombies but i remember reading here that there was a Bungie dev in a streamer's chat giving hints so...

Sry bro I have destiny 2 on pc and have come across tons of folks (on both sides of the pond) who didn't know they could change region.

For what it's worth it didn't notice any difference with the increased ping whilst playing on NA

I didn't get forsaken on pc (I mostly play Destiny 2 on xb1) otherwise I'd run the forges with you. Maybe check out the lfg in the discord?

Was that with a powerful frame or just with a normal one

Fair enough. I appretiate the help.

you keep doing her daily bounties and eventually she'll give you a rare bounty.

They have no reason?

How about to give people an attempt to figure it out still? It's still a valid challenge you can do at any time with rewards. Why would they spoil their own content? When have they ever given us the solution to something? Why would we play the game if  Bungie told us is?
---
It would also be a good test for Penumbra.

rare bounties come from completing  her daily bounties.

---
Don't really need strats for a walker imo. All them crit points make it way easier than the other bosses
---
Also possible with Sleeper at PL600.  3x buff works well with top tier weapons.

Take 1 upvote for being spot on good Sir. Many tears were cried.

Yes thank you for understanding the point that so many on here don't grasp. Being told don't play it, or don't purchase it, or don't play what you don't like are jerk responses to people. There is nothing wrong with wanting to play and progress in the activities of the game that you like without being gimped because you didn't do all of the dailies in activities that you do not like. This is one of the only mmos that I have ever played that forces specific content types on players in order to progress. I have never seen a mmo that forces people to play pvp to progress faster. People saying you do not have to do every activity to progress can go pound sand. If you skipped half of the milestones for instance it would take you so long to get to the cap that by the time you did the cap would be raised in the next content drop. Its not feasible.
---
Kill the servitors when they spawn instead of blindly dpsing the boss
---
You on PC? I like to take groups of people through the Leviathan on weekends. If you‚Äôre down for it, let me know, and I‚Äôll find some time to help you next week! Teaching it is very easy since the encounters aren‚Äôt too complicated. Fastest time I can get your through it is 40 minutes to an hour, so if you ever find time that‚Äôs an estimate of how long it‚Äôll take
---
Whenever someone tries to call me trash I just say thanks for noticing cus it bugs them more than their insults bug me
---
i do indeed, 4mbps download :(
---
Nope, Im supporting the dev team building a game for the playerbase that stays, not the one that comes and goes, because it was proven through year 1 of D2 thats where they need to be.  It was so obviously proven they realized it 3 months after the game dropped.
---
/s?
---
Sniper is the exotic box quest. Megaman blaster is just like Le Monarque; do frames and get lucky.
---
Oof, that's a tough one, Im not to familiar with rocket launcher but I'd say anything that increases your velocity and blast radius for the first two perks, and then auto loading holster and cluster bombs? Sorry I can't give you a definite answer on that
---
I love getting these messages
---
Thanks man
---
And the funny thing....the player base is as high as ever since Forsaken, which changed the game for the more hardcore players big time.  
---
You seem to be wishing for this to fail when its clearly not.
---
Few things will stop my fists of Justice 
---
Guess again!!
---
Imagine developers charging money to play new content in a game
---
You are more than welcome to join 
---
Jesus, who pissed in your Cheerios?
---
Away
---
If it's anything like le monarque it won't take much grinding. It'll be jotunns for everyone!
---
FUCKING LIES 
---
Hopefully they fix it. No way they made it available for us get the exotic box quest for all 3 chars, had to unlock each forge on all 3, then the final black armory key for only 1 char. Makes no sense, unless they're trying to stall. I got the key on my titan and my warlock had the bounty fml
---
Speaking of which remember that Eris bounty in D1 where you had to melee cursed thrall without dying? I do, and it trained me well
---
no problem
---
Yup, I've played 100's of hours and have never seen one of these rare bounties.  Only know two others players that have seen one.  Really unhappy that this quest is RNG blocked.  Which I think is the first exotic quest to ever have a step like this.
---
I'm trying to find the tweet from Bungie, but it basically said that they were listening to feedback from the community and would be making changes to accommodate.
---
Now I don't know how hard the puzzle was, but if Datto had to take a break after 22 hours I'm guessing it was insane.  For these streamers to essentially give up 20+ hours of their time only to have the devs turn around and open things up for the squeaky wheels seems like a huge disservice to the content creators.
---
My biggest issue is that before Forsaken the community was bemoaning about how there wasn't enough content to keep them coming back.  Then we get Forsaken and things were great, but now we get the first content injection since that release (Black Armory) and people get cranky because they can't access it right away.  What does this community really want?  Does anyone even know anymore?  
---
When BA dropped I had just transferred from PS4 to PC and wasn't even close to being able to enjoy the new content.  But I wasn't upset about it!  I knew that when I finished Forsaken and hit 600 power I would still have a bunch more to do.  Now it's been only 3 (has it been three?) weeks since BA has dropped and they're still coming out with content.  It just so happens that it is one of the hardest puzzles to see the light of Destiny (how long did the first team to clear VOG take?).  People should be ecstatic!  Instead the squeaky wheels come out and force Bungies hand to open it up.
---
Some people just cannot be satisfied.
---
Well Bungie gave in way to easily after only a day or two of complaining. There's precedent of developers sticking to the plan and not giving out freebies because the players complained it's too hard after only a day or two of trying. I won't say listening to the players is bad, since it's good, but Bungie listens to the players and reacts way too extremely (This case, PvP nerfing PvE etc). I've read the comments about a dev giving hints, but once again, they tried for two days max then gave up. Let alone the fact that none of the comments list who the streamer/devs involved were, how many hints, or the fact that a hint from one person on the dev team varies vastly from a hint approved by multiple people to give out exactly how much information they want to give out. The main point though is that people only tried for two days then complained about a puzzle. Puzzles aren't a one run and done kind of thing, this makes it seem like it's more of a instant gratification issues as opposed to the content actually being hard. It may come up that some of the steps are impossible or stupidly hard, but we don't know because no ones given it enough time.
---
I got it back to back yesterday second drop was masterworked   
---
ye sure but i cant find u in battlenet.. :/ your name?
---
It‚Äôs only Gofannon and Izanami. Similarly, Jotunn can only drop from Bergusia
---
Whatever you want to think, more power to you man. I already told you the actual truth and if you want more information about the actual truth on why destiny 2 almost failed by a unanimous group of critics and user reviews you can read it by following these links, once you are done being in denial:

:FBI: delete that crap right now
---
You realize that this isn't the only place where Destiny players congregate, right?
---
keep completing adas daily bounties and eventually you'll have a rare bounty she will give you
---
I wasn't arguing that. I agree Bungie gave in when they shouldn't. That was the point of my first comment you rrplied to.
---
I did. Sorry.
---
Wonderful#1961
---
See, white nail is great. As you said, potential for infinite damage, but here‚Äôs the thing.... in most situations where you‚Äôd take whisper, the infinite factor is less important, as you generally have a fireteam with you doing damage. If you are shooting more than 20 shots, more than likely someone on your team is slacking very hard. Mind you, yeah, that‚Äôs not always the situation, sometimes infinite ammo is what you want, I‚Äôm just going on the common use.
---
That said, imo the thing we should be looking at is not how whether IB can keep up with white nail, it‚Äôs whether IB can keep up with whispered breathing. 
---
So what‚Äôs the diff between a full reserve of IB vs 20 shots of WotW. 
---
You know reviews aren't objective data right?
---
I never once said those DLCs were great, youre arguing a point I never made.  You wanna show me where things got worse after Forsaken because players left en mass, feel free.  The game is stronger right now than D2 ever has been, all the reviews in the world wont prove that wrong.
---
r/nocontext
---
Definitely agree that the armor in this game could use more variety. There are a couple cool sets/neat-looking exotics but most things have far less uniqueness than D1. And it would be a cool throwback if they brought in some of the most popular D1 content (I‚Äôve seen it suggested that the infinite forest would work well for that kind of thing since it simulates all of space and time). 
---
However I don‚Äôt know that I want D2 to just be a reproduction of D1, which if you start bringing in lots of old favorites and they function exactly the same, wouldn‚Äôt that kind of be what happens? If I want to play D1, I‚Äôll go play it haha. I think there‚Äôs a fine balance there, and I‚Äôd rather see new stuff than old.
---
Honestly I think people tend to forget that there were lots of complaints about D1, too. It‚Äôs always had some serious flaws, and nostalgia has made us gloss them over and only remember how much fun we had. I‚Äôm not saying D2 is perfect or that there aren‚Äôt things I think it could really improve on. D2 addressed some of D1s issues but traded them for others, haha. But I can‚Äôt deny that I have tons of fun, equal to what I had in D1. Its still the game I get the most time out of.
---
Yeah, this was just a fun thing to do/see
---
thank you so much that makes sense now :)
---
Make sure you're using combat scope and quick draw.  I came across an enemy guardian in a gambit game last night who was using the long range scope with hip fire grip, suffice to say I did not enlighten him.
---
After you've selected combat scope just point in the general direction of players and hit fire. The gun's broken aim assist will do the rest 
---
Great info thanks! 
---
You can get it from volundr too
---
Thx 
---
I completed one on Monday too...
---
Its been like a day since the release and they already gave up?
---
Because it was in your weapon slot and looked like a letter, they changed it.
---
Second one is Legend of Acrius.
---
Don‚Äôt they all have trench barrel?
---
Yikes imagine playing a bad game lol spookyüëª
---
You're impossible man, I'm done ha. You're not going to waiver from your opinion so just keep running with it. I don't know what to tell you. Its obvious that the hardcore group has made up this fake reason the game failed and that you won't waiver from it even when the actual truth is slapping you right in the face. Forsaken is better then ever because the CONTENT is better then ever. As I have been saying for like 3 flippin hours to you over reddit of all places. Get over it, move on.
---
What is your ingame name
---
Wait, ive been on a break...
---
Eris DIED????
---
Is it something that happens in game or you are just told about it?
---
Actually a lot of people have done that test and took in consideration the numbers, you can check Ehroar's video (redeem) and it explain the situation quite well, IB can't compete against Whisper for something like a boss fight just because of that DPS and the fact that you can shoot forever. This is the reason why other snipers such as Darci are not used anymore (don't count scourge of the past because we're talking about an overall usage). 
---
The fix is super simple but knowing bungie they're not going to do anything otherwise they're going to pull a "Fourth times the charm" if you know what I mean.
---
Yea I hear you, I just got my second character to 50 this week. You gotta just take your time on it even though sometimes it feels like your missing out. I see too many people on here getting burned out on the game because they are sprinting the grind trying to get it done as quickly as possible. Taking my time and doing what I enjoy has worked for me anyway.
---
Good luck and god's speed Guardian!
---
P.S. Funny pic by the way
---
Impossible because I like to back my opinion with facts and not more opinion?  Makes perfect sense.
---
The content is better because they actually gave us substantial content....not a raid that was a game show that you run in circles for an hour.  
---
 Wishender deals very good damage, give it another go 
---
could keep it locked, maybe throw in some RNG so everybody had to do it themself. Could be fun
---
Oh man, its like Huckleberry and I... fuck that gun
---
fr? when was that confirmed
---
So can the engram drop anything even if he isn‚Äôt selling it? 
---
Sweet! I personally can't wait to never get this thing because I only have one lvl 50 character :(
---
That‚Äôs where I got mine 
---
Edit: my friend got or monarque and jotunn at the same time last night in volundr as well
---
:0
---
Dude I completed mine Tuesday. I feel you. ):
---
I hope it works, but if not, try running top tree solar with the melee ability to assist in your jump as long as you have enough momentum. Also, if you have lion rampant leg exotics pair those with it. Practice some jumps not onto the pipes prior too. 
---
Don't worry, my warlock is the only one with all four forges. 
---
I love Countdown. Fucking Clash and Control
---
thanks for the feedback but I hate it when GPUs go adaptive and go from 1900mhz to 300mhz so I overclock my gpus.
---
He showed off a shortcut I've never seen before. Could've been worse.
---
good. activision is cancer. 
---
My very first hc back then when it was just released was surrounded and rampage, and i didn't forge another one since
---
NP. We all should help each other.
---
Oh fuck oh geez this can be really good or really bad
---
I went down there today and there were way to many people there I havent even seen a croud like that even at the spider
---
In addition to what I mentioned below, it‚Äôs also worth noting a few more things:
---
-IB has the flexibility to kill smaller enemies without as much ammo consumption, and also uses special ammo, making it naturally easier to acquire
---
-IB occupies the kinetic slot, allow you to equip another high dps heavy weap (hammerhead, rockets) in tandem
---
-If we are taking about burning high hp targets such as a raid boss, one assumes ammo reserves are plentiful for all slots. Therefore the comparison should be: 20 whisper vs full reserve IB *plus* any other damage you can put in within the time difference of firing both weapons.
---
Holy flip, this might be a literal game-changer. I‚Äôve felt that lots of issues have been rooted in Activision‚Äôs oversight/expectations. We‚Äôll see now whether Bungie has just had their hands tied to take the game in a truly great direction. 
---
I think they need to add fail overs to their RNG system.
---
Here are some ideas:
---
1) If you haven't received a 1k after 30 clears of Riven it will drop for you. Since you can only complete a raid three times a week if you have three characters something like this puts a long time gate on a item so it can't be brute forced, but eventually for those of us with terrible RNG it will drop.    
---
2) Rotate the RNG calculation.  However they are doing it needs to rotate on a reasonable time frame. Weekly reset would likely be fine.  They have to have enough data to figure that their RNG calculation is yielding less than intended rates for some players.
---
3) Give us rare, one time use items that we can earn to increase our drop rate.  I enjoyed the items from D1 that increased drop rates.   Bring something like that back, make them hard to get if you want and single use. 
---
It just takes 4 episodes to reach the ememy
---
QUICK UPDATE to your question, missed one thing. I got final Vanguard Emblem even without completing secret triumph. So it's not necessary for this one ;)
---
D***head...he sasses ghost in that one mission
---
You guardians ready for this game to go from good to fucking amazing?
---
My name is not important...
---
Idk if this is hype or not, i think it is 
---
finally a hunter that's not running blade barrage!
---
I loved the golden gun and will keep using it no matter what situation it is! can't count how many times it saved me and my whole team!
---
Fingers crossed this gives Bungie full creative freedom. Please please please be a good thing
---
Baha ya, funny joke there bud. 
---
Swolethion's big bro??
---
I've done over 200 daily bounties and have not received a rare bounty.
---
Like I said, I agree that whisper CAN be higher on the condition you shoot more than 20 times. I‚Äôm wondering what the comparison is if you don‚Äôt truly gain bonuses from white nail. Because simply put, if you don‚Äôt shoot at least your reserves with whisper, white nail could just not be there and it won‚Äôt matter 
---
Righto, the fated engram can only be bought once per weekend (I think that's per character, but I'm not certain). It will give you a random year 1 exotic that you don't already have. He sells is 1 exotic weapon, and 1 exotic armor piece for each class, and that stock changes each week. 
---
Basically you want to go to him when you get a chance on the weekend while he's around, buy the weapon if you don't already have it, and then buy whatever armor piece he has if you don't already have it, and then last buy the fated engram.
---
Man this is crazy news!
---
I've been giving you facts for hours ha! I even started linking it.
---
In any case you are finally agreeing with me because your second sentence is exactly what I have been saying, the substantial content is why it is so successful and none of the content drops have really been for the hardcore player they are for everyone. Especially for gambit, which is the first pvp mode in a while I actively enjoy. In any case. I don't think your a jerk or anything by the way just two opposite sides of a feedback point. I do get your views on the topic I just feel differently. It could even be both points combined who knows. Warmind and osiris clearly performed terribly, and maybe some grind did need to get added for the more hardcore players. All that I was ever trying to say... is that doesn't mean that I have to or the average casual player is going to like that grind. So my proposed solution was a marked/token system to appease both sides, you still get your heavy grind where you want it, casual players still get a more approachable way to progress in the exact activities that they want to.
---
Hoping for the best. We already know what life is like under Activation. 
---
Somebody posts this weekly, just kill the three servitors when they enter
---
You want some Taken sauces or a dip of Scorn-Slime to your Salad?
---
Yeah they're pretty squishy, just thought it looked pretty fun
---
Good?
---
Either way fuck Activision!
---
Ohh man ohh man, this is exciting!
---
And people say middle tree titan is doo doo. I laugh as I block their supers. 
---
This only means Bungie are going to have less budget to make things. I dont think is a good move for us
---
This is it, guardian! 
---
Let us hope they can deliver, Destiny is a big project that requires a lot of work, if they look at it honestly and make sure to not start over for d3 (like vanilla d2 vs final d1).  This could be a really good thing.
---
A review isnt a fact.  If you don't understand that basic concept Im good. 
---
I'm not doing the forge either, but that's because Black Armory isn't worthwhile content. Really wishing I hadn't bought the annual pass
---
You could still have a free for all mode where you can still use them and let the players decide what mode they'd like to play 
---
You're literally not understanding anything of what I said and not taking in consideration the factual PROOF aviable for everyone and something coming from one of the players that's part of the top 1% of the playerbase.
---
Please do yourself a favor and check the video I mentioned above.
---
I have no problem with it. They called it a content drop not an expansion. I knew what I was paying for but, to each their own. 
---
Ok that makes sense
---
Is there any word on how this will affect PC players?
---
Also, how is it Bungies problem that these people spent that much time in one sitting?  C'mon man.  If I drove a car for 30 hours straight with no rest and got into an accident it wouldn't be the car manufacturers fault.  It would be mine.  It's called personal responsibility.  And if someone runs into health problems because they couldn't turn a game off, there's a much bigger problem than the puzzle being too hard.  
---
*cue old man rant* Back in my day the journey in a game was always more enjoyable than the end result.  We all paid for this content, and I feel like I'm getting what I paid for (because I bought it on sale, but I digress).
---
Could be, I saw some theories about the door having a hitbox or something, which I dont think was seen on the previous levels, so I think that might be a hint. 
---
This is childish, im done with you. Why are you on a sub dedicated to a trash game?
---
WOOOO
---
THIS IS RAPE
---
Well $11.67 to be exact you paid for 3 different things
---
pretty sure bungie are cashed up enough 
---
"i used an overpowered super and got kills with it"
---
This is gonna to one of two ways. Let‚Äôs see where it goes 
---
There is a post on Bungie.net saying that the transition is currently in motion. 
---
But what does it mean???
---
Nope, random rolls :(
---
I'm at 9 clears and I've seen 2 drop, neither had trench
---
I dont even play destiny and im excited knowing how pain in the ass activision can be as a ¬®partner¬®
---
&gt; Guild Wars 2
---
Which actively cannibalized old content. I was half way through an ascended armor set when HoT hit. They upset all the farming, WvWvW was still a pile of garbage after the failed map change, I was enjoying dungeons when they nerfed those into the ground, and then they wanted more money from me on top of that to get the content to restore my ability to farm back to pre-HoT levels.
---
You know it's bad if you quit a game to go back to EVE "Spreadsheets" Online.
---
EDIT: More to the point here, I would worry that Bungie would internalize the need for cash, moving the toxic management priorities closer to the creative core of the team. That spells franchise and studio death.
---
Seems like a normal black armory to me 
---
Yeah, but it never said anywhere its a one per account quest. I always start the week with the character that needs the most work. Luckily that character had a rare bounty
---
The only reason I want D3 is so that console players can finally move off of 30 FPS. This might sound stupid to some people, but a big reason I stopped playing destiny in 2018 is because I couldn‚Äôt stand playing games running at 60-144 FPS (sometimes I game on PC) to 30 FPS on the console version. Almost all next gen shooters run smoothly at 60 FPS on Xbox one/ps4, and lagging behind at 30 makes the game feel choppy and outdated. 
---
I recently downloaded destiny 2 for free on PC and it is a completely different game. A much more enjoyable experience, but as someone who played since the release of D1 on Xbox, It isn‚Äôt the same playing without friends. 
---
:) 
---
Publishers still have a lot of input on development when it comes to monetizing the game after launch (ie Eververse, Season Pass, DLC). Activision has publicly stated that Destiny is not making for them, the kind of money they had hoped, which if I am reading between the lines correctly mean that they see the millions of idiots buying worthless skins for Fornite and are wondering why real gamers aren't spending the same kinda coin on Destiny.
---
Hopefully this means Bungie can create content without pressure to include incentives for players to keep dumping cash into the game.
---
Is it still september 2018?
---
That man is no lord! Outrageous! Strip him of his title immediately. O said GOOD DAY
---
Hopefully they stay independent.  Although Id love to see old school Xbox players reactions if Sony bought them lol. Realistically gaming as a whole would be better with a independent bungie
---
Mesa free
---
‚ÄúI complain to nerf anything fun‚Äù
---
I don‚Äôt hate PlayStation but saying it‚Äôs better because exclusives is kinda dumb, I mean Xbox has exclusives too and then being able to play them on pc is actually cool and some of the Xbox exclusives are just as good if not better than some PlayStation exclusives we have the master chief collection with remastered graphics that we can switch on the fly, and you can‚Äôt tell me that the scene when master chief kicked the covenant bomb into the ships core wasn‚Äôt badass, on top of halo CE through ODST we have crackdown three coming soon, I heard cuphead was good never played it though, sea of thieves, sunset overdrive which I loved, and on top of all this with the game pass all exclusives are free along with others games. Again I don‚Äôt hate PlayStation my favorite game of all time was on the ps2.
---
Potentially terrified, this could end up being great or terrible.
---
Nice.
---
Day 1 player here, still kickin' around, but hear me out. I've seriously been losing more and more interest in my longest lasting hobby as time goes on.  
---
Not anymore- all the fuck aboard this hype train. I'm almost 30, Bungie Studios has been pivitol in my gaming interests. Halos 1-3 have more time played than I have even CLOSE in Destiny because they were each so individually revolutionary.  
---
I used to feel the same way about Destiny, especially in the first year. ESPECIALLY when they used to change crucible on a regular basis. That was really what it was- a crucible. Regular and community driven patches forced regular power shifts in PvP and you had to adapt or sink.  
---
Same with the Raids, after the... let's say "volatile"... release of vanilla, the devs listened and boom. Dark Below. The best era in pve content imo (shout out to the sword swingers that glitched the bridge). Same with the community, most everything being positive.  
---
Now Year 2 in comparison just feels so.... corporate? With all the Eververse bs (same goes in Y1, no lies there) and silver driven loot it feels like Bungie's been forced to listen to the money instead of the people.  
---
I hope this changes that- I think it will! hype HYPEE  
---
Tl;dr Dark Below 2.0 please
---
Eyes up, guardians. We may be heading towards a bright future! 
---
Who's complaining, I PVP with shards all the time
---
Movement aside, at least 140s and 150s are *useable* in PvP for PC guys. I'd love to see the usage numbers for 140/150 handcannons on console in the crucible.... that aren't named Ace of Spades
---
I feel like the only reason to buy a console is for the exclusives. I play D2 on PC. 
---
This exact post has been made multiple times, every day, for like 3 weeks. Maybe bungie can find a way to let people know in game about known bugs
---
I love every thing about this post üòç
---
Holy shit, I just had a minor heart attack lmao
---
I dont even have the 35 bucks for forge

Specifically it was NetEase, who have a partnership with Blizzard.  https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1083474638401880064

It's a recent thing for me, I got a new job in November and finally was able to buy forsaken plus the pass and everything haha!
---
This is amazing. I want the old Bungie back.  I hope this works out.

Wonder what this means for the future of the franchise

Thats like me but i only yell at OEM scrubs
