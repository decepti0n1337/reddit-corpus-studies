Depends. I’ll look at some spoilers depending on what it is. I basically avoided reddit and Facebook until I could go see endgame. I’ll look at some things game related if I want to see how to get something in game and there is a spoiler involved.

---
I wan't this expansion so badly, but tapped out after early Christmas shopping D:  
---
I hope my family loves me enough to get it for me for Christmas (preferably very very early)
---
Have you never heard of ballistic slam titans with skullfort? Yeet your ass in, then slap some fools.
---
My Xbox achievements still says 0 players have completed 100% of Borderlands 3 achievements.
---
Is this real I want it
---
*tips hat*
---
Can’t you just wear the eververse ornaments?
---
Indeed.
---
Sadly no
---
I love this community.
---
I would so use it

Happy cake day!
---
on my steam i have the same, if i go to manage downloads it says scheduled for 23 34. literally a few mins time, i'm hoping this is the preload, maybe check under manage downloads and see if you have the same?
---
Thank you very much.
---
F
---
Why u uninstalling?
---
I would take time off to be able to play but it sounds like servers won’t be up until 10am PDT which is around 1pm EST iirc. I’m excited to see the first expansion sans activision and see if their vision for what the game should have been has been realized.
---
Wait, thats illegal
---
Your not using bottom tree striker, are you actually ready?
---
Damn...he shoulder thicc
---
But only for those who bought the expansion wasn't it, what about the free new light version ?
---
Raids will never have matchmaking. Too much coordination needed compared to a strike or nightfall.
---
Thanks for the info
---
it comes out tomorrow
---
Google Destiny New Light....why are so many incapable people here?
---
We should but we're stubbornly attached to our clan name :P
---
So i will get it tomorrow??
---
Im stealing this for my wallpaper right now.
---
So am I sol if I cant transfer my stuff from blizzard because the bungie site is down?
---
Thats what i did for ps, and for my rainmeter
---
Base game, warmind and curse of Osiris are free to play. You will need to buy forsaken still, but if you do, the annual pass for it will be free. You will also need to buy anything starting at shadowkeep and whatever comes after.
---
I pre ordered shadowkeep from them and they gave me a used code, now I'm waiting on the support thing. Don't preorder anything with them
---
Same here, I am also kinda hoping for some voice acting for the players guardian like what they did in Destiny 1 and shadowkeep. I just think it adds an extra layer of story building that can bring extra meaning into the game.
---
I needed something to replace my cyberpunk 2077 one.
---
This needs to be on the front page yesterday
---
Hey you might get lucky, and a well to do Guardian could privately message you and gift a code to you. 
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I've seen stuff like that happen. Who knows.
---
Hunter, hunter, tricorn*
---
Will Forsaken’s gameplay changes (I’ve heard it gave D2 an overhaul) apply to pre-Forsaken content as well? I’m curious if those changes are permanent / retroactive.
---
you are correct
---
Google.com
---
I wish I had played enough to have all that bright dust
---
Xbox shows a splash screen apparently.
---
yes, everyone will, no matter what server or place in the world you are
---
It's like 50 in aus bux, feels bad
---
That will be pretty sweet to get some of my older exotics up to 750.
---
I can dream.
---
They probably can't transfer ever account at once. It will take time. Mine shows all my B.net stuff has moved over but I'm sure it will take time for everyone to see it
---
Real sad gamer hours.
---
Similar thing happened in batman arkham knight where the joker (he was dead and was like a nightmare) followed batman around taunting him and stuff. It would be kinda cool for cayde to do that
---
That titan hit his head one too many times
---
Nah man, Moon's haunted. Gotta look on the dark side
---
Could even be how we obtain catalyst for Ace....
---
im happy i finally get to use my geomags and not get bitched at for not using well
---
I see,another warlock of culture with red circuited geomags
---
No i have the Game for 1 1/2 year now but its Not FAIR like most of the Users here are saying if i buy a Game for a Price and a few months Later the Game is free and i dont get anything for it. thats fvcking disgusting. At least they should give Users who transfer their Accounts from bungie the new dlc. That would be fair.
---
go to you tube find houndish's video on this very topic
---
Nordic Victory. Been so in every game we've gone to with enough people to make a guild.
---
I haven't had to go to school since 1996. It's all good.
---
I need a new plan for gambit, can’t crutch on Luna and mountaintop for the boss phase
---
That’s tomorrow
---
Destiny 2: Fashion week
---
Yeah I setup my cross save so I can play on steam. I would say the facial structure is more detailed compared to D1
---
I didn't know battle passes and content going away at the end of a season was a beacon of light in the gaming industry, but hey, if that floats your boat go off.
---
oof if it wasn't so expensive i would probably have gotten one to. but that's like my whole gaming budget.

HDR is 'different' on Destiny. Bungie have strange ideas of middle points.
---
Best bet, and it worked for me and lots of others, is to go to link and follow simple instructions and game will look lot better.

I just screamed god dammit I got rick rolled
---
New player here. Excited to play a game with endgame content.
---
I had to turn mine on in the settings and now when I boot an HDR source, it says HDR in the upper right corner of my tv. There is also a trick with Destiny's brightness... Destiny's HDR is based off the SDR setting. You have to turn off HDR on your TV boot D2, change your brightness to default, turn HDR back on in your tv, boot D2 again (in HDR) and adjust your brightness again.

Yup. Look around on the @destinythegame twitter and look for the season of undying calendar. The left side of the calendar has all of the free stuff listed. There’s a lot!

how can i double up vote?

Me running away from problems irl

It has to be Legendary, otherwise if it was Exotic then you could only have one at a time.
---
That's a spicy traveler
---
Oh no a battle pass and removal of content no one plays what ever shall we do!
---
Hope not, blueberries with no mic trying Scourge?? 
---
Just no!
---
I’ll have to try that one next time, thanks for the tip
---
Go look at your downloads in steam. It will tell you what is installed. But keep in mind not everyone will be transferred at once so it may take time for your account to be moved.
---
When can I pre load the free version of destiny 2
---
😂Got teletubbies vibes from them jumping around
---
\[Here it is\]([https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1850427017&amp;searchtext=shadowkeep](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1850427017&amp;searchtext=shadowkeep))
---
It is through wallpaper engine FYI
---
I farmed dinklebot for loot o grams and mainly got whites I did get a conference call and butcher though
---
Wow this is cool. Thank you so much for sharing this. Amazing.
---
From what I understand if you dont see the old dlc's just wait, the transfers are still in progress until launch.
---
Bros before shadows.
---
I can see all of my licenses for D2 on Steam now, so it might just be taking a while to process through everyone who migrated.
---
[deleted]
---
Thanks OP.
---
I have all the dlcs lol except for shadowkeep that's the only one I'm waiting on haha
---
Scholars maintain we'll still be asking this question some years in the future.
---
I've been to New Zealand once and it's so beautiful. And you guys get games super early lol.
---
Time to save $85 cause I want my Ace of Spades back

Hopefully you were in a public place and people stared. :)

Do you have hdr on? I have hue sync and if I have hdr and sync on at the same time, the game looks like shit. It's touchy. Just hdr looks amazeballs though!

Oh nice! Who?

It is terrible isn’t it. But I am very glad to have stumbled upon you, hope you have an excellent first day of Shadowkeep tomorrow!
---
Tis but a scratch.
---
I live in Aus so for me, stean downloading anything higher than 2.5-3MB/S is rare. Took me 12 hours to install doom 2016 and that was before the forced switch to another ISP (They made a deal with the govt to replace the copper wire with fiber optic. Did some of it, realised it would be too expensive and now just reuses old wiring. This deal was made years ago (i think 10 years?) And still hasnt had everyone switch)
---
Moons haunted
---
Why?
---
Just to say I believe everyone will start at Level 50 and have a Light level of 750. Can’t remember sauce :(

BWAAH BWAAH BWAAAAAAAH BWUNH
---
Nice pre shadow keep hype is real
---
Watching and savoring this video tonight.
---
I almost used sound
---
He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold.
---
Meanwhile you get your prestige clear while I'm stuck with that damn Youtuber hamming it up... Still a little salty about that.
---
im faking a sick day to play it
---
Last wish. Raid from forsaken.
---
 Not in my knowledge beside the fact that old ennemis from the previous title are making a return as nightmares.
---
Destiny 2 is about the Red War (the Red Legion) what happenned in the past, stay in the past. But you still should take a look on YouTube to see if you can put a hand on a Destiny 1 recap, because there's some conversations here and there that are definitely used to dramatise the situation. As exemple...through comparaison.
---
Destiny 1 was about a war against the Hive and the Corrupted. And they are still in Destiny 2. They definitely don't have the same role as they have been defeated, but it could confuse you a bit.
---
And we're no strangers to love.
---
Dammit you got me. Have your upvote...
---
Turn off HDR, both the TV and the game have it working which makes everything look darker, I had the same problem
---
&lt;3
---
Might be right there with you brother. Just started coughing to sell it to my gf
---
Turn hdr off on the tv?
---
I couldn't find forsaken for pc anywhere, not even on bungies site so hope it is free, getting shadowkeep either way. Missed this game haha
---
I hate you OP
---
Fellow Aussie? We’re ahead of America but timezone but while it’s gonna be October 2 here, it’s October 1 there. 
---
Should be up at 3am Sydney time. That’s when the game is open
---
Actually from what I saw from the New Light gameplay Cayde is dead from the beginning for new players. I could be wrong but by all means it would make sense
---
I love you anyway fellow guardian.
---
Goddammit i went to open steam to see if i could download d2 now but then i heard the blessed song
---
Do you have any idea how much hate bungie would get if that were true? Wouldn't be a good start for them being on their own
---
In-game, otherwise you won't have HDR when you are using tv for other stuff mate
---
All your characters, and everything in your vault, is getting bumped to 750 on reset Tuesday morning.
---
That’s what I thought but just wanted to verify. Thanks man.
---
Not exotics, but yeah, that's why I responded.  https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/09/26/destiny-2-adds-forges-menagerie-and-more-to-free-new-light-content/
---
3 am  here we come :/
---
No problem mate,  enjoy!
---
Sweeeeeeeeet, I dont really know what Shadowkeep is doing other than making the game free.  and adding the expansion.
---
There's honestly so much I could type right now about all the lore and different turns / arcs going on in the Destiny universe.
---
But yeah.  As mentioned .. mynameisbyf just made a 4 hour video about all of it ... It's a masterpiece and needs to be seen by as many people as possible...
---
Yeah thats why i was so surprised, not surprised however that my friend was exaggerating..
---
My wife is looking at me like I'm a freak because of how much I laughed at this. Thank you haha
---
In hindsight I don't understand how rickrolling became a thing, that's an objectively great song and there was so much trash in the 80s
---
CURSED
---
I need something that is strictly all about destiny 1 as to not spoil anything in D2
---
If I purchase shadowkeep on Steam and then use my xbox account as the cross save can I play shadowkeep on my cross save account ?
---
Royal flush
---
I HAVE 55 IN MY STEAM AGHHHHHHHHH
---
You’re welcome buddy.
---
Oh nice, I'm happy with that then
---
Yep remember the second one, some nice semi quiet music, then kills my ears, good times
---
Forsaken will be cut down in price to about 25 bucks for the annual pass and the dlc I think
---
Come to think of it, this is a great name for an ornament for Ace of Spades
---
*kl-klick*
---
This is like a broken clock that's wrong for one specific day and then right the rest of them.
---
Anytime.
---
How can I get this onto my Xbox wallpaper?
---
LMAO!! WTF?!?!?!
---
On a serious note, Anthem is the only shooter to ever give me a terrible headache. Terrible game.
---
I told so many people today about the new free-to-play model. I’m doing my part!
---
See how fucked the Recluse is, and if it's trash, switch up my usual Revoker/Recluse to Antiope/Luna's Howl
---
Listen i love destiny and hate Activision as much as the next warlock. BUT if and/or when they fuck up now there will be no scapegoat. Just saying
---
Manifest Destiny
---
Lucky
---
Your rank will reset for crucible and gambit but the quest itself will stay
---
That's....hilariously incorrect, by all counts.
---
Your actions are unhealthy. Look at the way you zealously defend your deliberately antagonistic comments. Vision tinted red with hate is hard to see with.
---
I convinced my little bro to come back...well...he has to because I bought the deluxe edition for him.
---
Just give us Twilight Garrison and we can settle this peaceably.
---
Just ordered QR code stickers that Rick roll whoever scans them
---
Pretty sure OP means that you should use Ethernet. Sadly that doesn't change anything, Comcast bringeth and Comcast taketh away.
---
It took me a few seasons to even start on getting redrix. I doubt it resets progress.
---
anyone else think that song sounds like the super "we're doing amazing and traveling through time" music from chrono trigger?
---
!remindme 15 hours
---
Why can I hear this gif so clearly
---
In those moments i just pray that a quick headshot  stuns them, snipers and 100% accurate shotguns (good bone structure) can do that in one or 2 shots...
---
But sometimes they just dont seem to care
---
Damn you!!........   Well played!!
---
You..just you... I can't even be mad. Walked into it like an Australian Prime Minister into the ocean.
---
Yes! This is what I need.
---
Thanks for the insight. Will be a great day tomorrow. Enjoy gaurdian.
---
Probably, I already use Ethernet, I was just using WiFi as a general term for my Internet.
---
I'm glad that it wasn't the real deal, i'm going in as fresh as possible tomorrow at reset. See you there, guardians!
---
Ahh...The legendary swimming crash-fish in its natural habitat
---
Just hoping they bring back some d1 dances. Some were to dope to stay gone forever
---
The amount of effort you put into this is insane
---
This happened to me but a few days earlier
---
I was gonna ask the same thing, I think only the Shadowkeep pre-load is available right now and New Light will be available tomorrow at some point but I’m not sure
---
Expect the unexpected guardian
---
Fuck
---
You’re on EST? How did you do that already? The rest of us are on EDT.
---
rip to me LOL
---
I just imagine it being like Mimir on Kratos throughout God of War
---
How did I know what? Is there a joke I'm missing? Isn't EDT the same as EST? I'm confused
---
Edit: I misread "do" as "know" but I am still just as confused
---
I recommend getting comfortable as it is long but yes I second that this will get you caught up and his voice is amazing
---
I'm gonna watch the Taken King live action trailer now.
---
I will.  When I get out of work.  Also, the recluse is great, get one.  Should be easier this season because glory will have irrevocable milestones.
---
24hr server maintenance
---
I can tell you play a lot!!
---
Pretty sure that’s fan made.
---
Ghaul never died on the moon and the fucker is back
---
I think you mean liberator..., because you cant negotiate if you dont have a hostage...
---
Nah not a confirmed thing.  Just something that I think would be cool.
---
I'm skipping school tomorrow for it
---
Then theyre not on xbox/ havent gotten every single achievement but still did most of the content in the game
---
Well you're not watching it your listening that's alot better. You watched a 4 hour video what have you done? Just pretty much zoned out can't remember what he said but Listening while you play you may remember the important stuff and beat a campaign.
---
Pretty much how I spend the day.
---
Oh thank you. I was so worried.
---
Kids Next Door, BATTLE STATION'S!!!
---
how am i able to download the game again? is that supposed to happen?
---
Ah gotcha, opposite for me. I play from 6pm to 4am is usually, I guess it could be bugged for you but it should still come out at the same time either way
---
Reset is a little less than 13 hours away
---
Are these mfers frolicking?!
---
No I mean october 2 isn't october 1
---
See I don't know if all my DLC has downloaded, my dlc list only has forsaken on it.  I do have all the DLC minus Shadowkeep. I see from your screen shot it says warmind and curse of osiris but mine does not.
---
I actually like the D2 launch theme the best.  Even though it wasn’t that long ago it makes me somewhat nostalgic for the early days of D2...
---
The game is downloaded the files will be released when the game comes out
---
Except they'd drop as there respective colors right? That would be sweet.
---
Im really curious too tbh, 3 things ik you can get banned for is model ripping, malicous glitches, and hacking.
---
Casually skips CoO
---
So happy this popped up in my recommendations again I miss the old destiny
---
Karma is a bitch. Lol
---
wait, people are actually sleeping?
---
It was eleven I’m just confused and don’t know what to do
---
Thanks man. I just needed the peace of mind.
---
ok...i just hope i dont have to download all that again
---
This looks like the Borderlands art style pretty cool
---
I wasn't going to be able to play shadowkeep, but someone drained the water tower in the town where I teach, so no school. So random. Torn between being concerned for students and elated about shadowkeep.
---
I threw in Skyrim
---
Hate you, love the song
---
Have you seen the sun?
---
Son of a bitch
---
I just let it sit there to listen to the new creepy intro music
---
Thanks for the invite, but i'll try the game a little first. I'll take note of your user name but I wonder if we will be able to play often since I'm in Canada :/
---
Jokes on you, I like that song.
---
Solid question tho. I'm very curious if they edited some cut scenes to explain to a new player...?
---
I can't stand GameStop went there today to cancel a year old pre-order grabbed an Xbox card came home and preordered shadowkeep.
---
 Someday it will be your turn guardian, and i bought my friend shadowkeep as well because i knew he wouldnt be able to buy it.
---
Hate this Game vs Game shit. I hate this "you can only play one game" thought.
---
AUD is always screwed. In a digital era it makes no sense.
---
DADADADADADA-DAADAA-DADADADADA-DAADAA-DADADAADAADAA

BWAAH BWAAAAAB BWAAAH BWAAAAAAAAAAAH

*taps forehead*
---
Bungie make this a ghost shell NOW
---
I’m so happy I swapped to Xbox. I don’t miss that shit at all lol
---
Lol, I played that song at work earlier. Some of the customers looked affronted. I was jammin' out. Followed it up with some a-ha "Take On Me"
---
Anyway,  " Show me what you got " is a trophy for D2 Vanilla,  it's not a New one. 
---
This trophy is to complete the Call's arms from Shaxx ( the old pvp quest you got every week before the 5 match thing was added)
---
Same. Oof.
---
I was all ready and waiting to remove this post for having spoilers - then I just, listened 😂
---
Nice. Lol.
---
**AWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO**
---
Hahaha!!!! 🤣🤣 I thank you for listening. I hate spoilers too.
---
When you spend the next three months of newbies carrying teams to the Dreaming City and back.
---
This seems a silly thing to do considering we know exactly when it launches. Why not instead make sure you're well rested and can binge when it launches as long as you can?
---
Not me, cause it isn't going live until like late morning or middle of the day depending on the time zone
---
Watching this at 2pm so when it finishes I can start playing shadowkeep.
---
The game won't be available until 10am PDT. That's 6pm in the UK. Still got a long day ahead of us before it's playable on Steam.
---
Holy crap
---
I read this comment just before it started playing.
---
10am PDT happens when this comment is 10 hours and 51 minutes old.

anyone interested/able to animate this for wallpaper engine!?!?
---
It was better when it said "mom's" haunted lol.
---
Moon's haunted
---
Anyone able to preload yet?
---
She shouldnt lose her characters or gear during the transfer.  That was only for the battle.net steam transfer
---
I'll definitely let you know :)
---
Space Magic. Pew pew. Loot.
---
It's a joke account
---
All of his reviews are "not recommended because not fortnite"
---
Idk really console has aim assist which makes stuff a bit easier but keyboard and mouse seems more precise and easier to control. Atleast I feel that way.
---
I have 1000 hours on Destiny 1 and 2, I have no idea what The Division is (I'm not joking)
---
Keyboard, destiny on pc feels like a completely different game compared to console. I have it on both PS4 and PC and the difference is huge. The first and most obvious is the frame rate. 30fps compared to 60-144fps is insane. Then obviously graphically the game looks 10x better on a pic that can run higher settings.
---
I don't know who you are, but I'm going to be fair too busy playing the game to watch anyone else do it... You know? Like how it was intended...
---
Why not?
---
Splash screen displays
---
Me: “Oh hell yeah, thats nice”
---
Loading screen displays
---
Also me: “god DAMN it...”
---
They look like some dumb fucking teletubbies XD

Why so short though

---
Devs screwed up their own game. The game felt like a good competitor until you hit the end game, then it went to shit. I really hope they don't take until patch 1.8 to fix the game like they did with the first Division.
---
The Division is somewhat like Destiny, only not as good. I stopped playing The Division after a few weeks. Jump in with Destiny 2 New Light and enjoy!
---
It's space magic.
---
No. Those activities are included, but not the raid. The patrol zones should still be accessible.
---
You just never quit, do you?
---
My first ever clear of last wish. when we got to riven, no one ever told me "dont shoot the eyes". so when riven opened her big dumb mouth, and her eyes popped open, what did my brain think? "ah, eyes! the weak point!" and so i went on to celestial nighthawk an eye.
---
Yeah that's the link I posted earlier. Best way to sort the image out in D2.
---
Whole it's not broken, they do all agree there are quirks in the game  as in it carries over SD settings and as such buggers brightness up for hdr. You have to turn of hdr, fix brightness in non hdr then go back set it up.
---
60 fps and k&amp;m
---
Are Goblins supposed to be that big?
---
I believe it’s Shocktober ;)
---
uncapped fps. Better graphics.   
---
KB&amp;m
---
As a highly suboptimal sidearm main...
---
hell yeah dude
---
Check back in like 10 hours
---
That map in particular is my favourite for that spot about tram, there's an easy way out and out. You can just slide through the window to get out. It's easy for catching people unexpected
---
Took out ghaul, woke up the traveler,
---
Ok thanks
---
What if it launches in the middle of the night?
---
What is Love? Is a national treasure. My not so guilty guilty pleasure.
---
Lol I'm equal parts angry and pleased. Because that was good. Happy launch day to you too!
---
Wait till shadowkeep comes out on reset time 1pm est I don't know what time that's for you
---
Sweet, thank you guardian.
---
Ah okay, thanks for the clarification!
---
Screw you. Have an upvote
---
Its 1am for me damn nevermind I still have a whole day left :(
---
someone posted a video on how good the new soundtrack for shadowkeep is but he bamboozled all of us by replacing the shadowkeep soundtrack with *the Rick Roll*
---
REEEEEEEEEE
---
Depends if you're console or PC.
---
PC doesn't have too many people that use Truth, Hammerhead is the meta weapon before shadowkeep. But I hear it's a must have for Console
---
What emblems are you referring to? I know that if you completed the moments of triumph in destiny 1 and bought destiny 2 on the same account and console you got some emblems
---
Oh yeah, it’s all coming together.
---
I really love it. Shame the background for loading is still white.
---
Thats SICK! Mind me sliding in your dms? I really want this as a tatoo. how would you feel about me using it?
---
Can’t wait to buy shadowkeep!!
---
Did that for a while before heading to work.
---
Yes you can.  [https://twitter.com/BungieHelp/status/1178744718101860352](https://twitter.com/BungieHelp/status/1178744718101860352)
---
I think div2 updates are lame as hell
---
1pm est
---
Can’t wait to buy it!
---
At server reset time not sure your time but mine would be 1pm Eastern
---
Jesus that new titan armor is hideous!

Link in destiny 2?

So whats the point in downvoting a perfectly legitimate quistion?
---
I don't think I will use them at all after the nerf. But that's okay, I didn't like using them in the first place.

New meta?
---
We don't get a splash screen for pc
---
Link has had his run-ins with the moon too!
---
Thankfully it's the free version
---
But it doesn’t spoil anything about the game
---
[here you go](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/dbiox1/this_destiny_2_shadowkeep_title_screen_music_is/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) watch it til the end
---
Guardian 5’11 
---
The V E X 6’1
---
Some people just want to watch the world burn.
---
Red and black is my favorite color scheme so I literally put it as every wallpaper. And sat there with it open as I’m doing other stuff
---
Finally a post that expresses my pain
---
Edge Transit will always find you.
---
It'll go live at 6pm UK time. 
---
In terms of what you need to know there would be plenty to cover. So I would say enjoy the game and feel free to ask me any questions as you go along. 
---
You get to make 3 characters in total so I recommend making one of each class - titan, warlock and hunter.
---
Each class has a slightly different role but with the changes titans are likely to be a decent choice. I main a warlock personally.
---
In terms of rarity it is classified by colour as
---
White - common
---
Green - uncommon
---
Blue - rare
---
Purple - legendary
---
Yellow - exotic
---
You can only hold 1 exotic gun and 1 exotic piece of armor at a time.
---
Don't infuse anything until the endgame. Your character will look like a Diabolical mess but don't worry about that.
---
Oh, and aim for the head and shoot.
---
I bet well get to eventually seize the lunar ruins and end up undoing the curse of balal to allow humanity to reach true understanding. but this will inadvertently revive Shem-Ha who will turn all of humanity into monsters to do her bidding.
---
Game is expected to go live at the usual daily reset.
---
For the Netherlands that's 19:00.
---
I'm most excited for new story missions, i always like running them at the start of a new expansion.
---
 
---
Then seeing the new armours for my Titan and choosing a new favourite look to work towards. Hoping for some slick armour options. 
---
Finally maybe i'll find some new favourite weapons along the way.
---
I checked Twitch viewership yesterday for a laugh. 
---
When I looked, Anthem has 34 viewers. 
---
Destiny 2 had 3500 WHILE IT WAS DOWN FOR MAINTENANCE. 😂
---
More over 100x more people tuned into Twitch to watch streamers show the new Shadowkeep login screen and music, than to watch Anthem gameplay. 
---
Fucking. Glorious.
---
[removed]
---
If you bought forsaken you may have all things released until shadowkeep, that's what I have
---
seems good, good explanation. I think I'll enjoy it alot more than warframe at least. I don't mind the grind, if anything warframe has more of it.
---
also what do you mean by "light level" is there heavy level too? lol
---
btw since there supposed to be no levels, what is considered endgame?
---
Cayde-mare will probably have our guardian dealing woth feelings of self doubt and inadequacy if we're going to get actual Character development out of it.
---
It'll be ready to go at 6pm, which is the usual steam release time.
---
Not me bud, 59 hours aprox. To download update 😭 (crappy internet).
---
Shadowkeep if bought on ps4 Will not be transfered to pc, only characters and items, forsaken i have no clue
---
wait there's no limit on how many exotics you can equip anymore?
---
it will open on today 10am PDT.
---
Never been able to afford any other games for pre-purchase, and never been interested in any free games that have been available for pre-"purchase", so I didn't know. Turns out I'm back in school tomorrow as well anyway, so there goes my day of Destiny 2.
---
*eyes closed
---
You need to buy all DLC content separately for all consoles. You will have access to all patrol spaces up to shadowkeep however will not have access to activities such as forges, raids, dungeons etc... So if you have annual pass content on ps4 you will have to buy it again on PC
---
Awesome setup!
---
And I love your background on the left!!
---
You just can't compare borderlands with destiny. It's apples to oranges.
---
melee warlock is god tier and nobody can convince me otherwise
---
6pm UK time
---
I always class endgame as anything once the campaign has finished.
---
So as a new light player my understanding is that you get all of year 1 Content. (Possibly stuff from the annual pass too). So the endgame would be the nightfall strikes, the raids
---
If you get some annual pass content then the forges and menagerie too. (If you don't have these then just ignore it - unless you buy forsaken)
---
It'll be live at weekly reset time.
---
We need this post on everyone’s phone EVERYONE.
---
That guy is my personal hero
---
"Guardian down!"
---
Launch should be in like 7 1/2 hours from now, that's when the daily reset happens.
---
This community is toxic just ignore them brother
---
Yeah, I never said when servers would be up, even if they were up exactly on October 1st I would only have a couple hours to play until I go to school, I'ma power grind it when I get home though
---
Have 3 characters. 1 of each class. You can raise the light lvl on weapons and then swap them between characters to act as a psudo powerful reward
---
Yeah Darkblade I think. I remember like 2 or 3 in a row that you had pretty much no chance but to run far far away
---
And then you find out the loading screen still white background... :|
---
The 24hr maintenance is still in progress, meaning New Light &amp; Shadowkeep have not gone live. Check again around 10am PDT to see if the store updates
---
let's go seize dem lunar ruins and take back humanity's future from the oppressors!
---
New light players gonna be terrified.
---
See, my DLC box doesn't look like this, it only has forsaken DLC in it. Though I had all the expansions before the transfer. Hopefully I'm not screwed.
---
Honestly fuck u my day is ruined
---
*laughs in not going through spoilers
---
This is so funny because it's true \*warlock tears trickle down cheek\*
---
It’s a joke. It’s literally in his steam username.
---
Whether we wanted it or not we’ve stepped into a war with the squares
---
Me too but I’m actually enjoying BL3 and will keep playing it
---
Aight fuck off heres my upvote
---
Not enough dancing
---
TOO DARK! WE NEED EYEFUCKING EARRAPE

You fool, I paused the video and read the comments first. My friends have been rickrolling me all day for the past week, I know all the tricks.
---
Yes, See you on the Moon.
---
I've got half a mind to reroll an alt for my intro to shadowkeep instead of my warlock just to grab this sweet child
---
Damn now I’m gonna go right a long comment on steam about how amazing the game is.
---
Up to you
---
One positive out of this - I have *so many* shaders now, I’m gonna be the snazziest guardian out there for a while, using shaders on my low power blue armor like it’s NOTHING!
---
Thats my discord Handel 😊
---
You may call me lucky but I come from work pretty much the same tile servers should start, so I got something to kill the time.  But still want it to happen already.
---
The game will be available at 10AM Pacific/6PM UK time.
---
I don’t like it being at 1:00pm either but whatever they feel is the best for them.
---
I never did
---
Should've been Skyrim
---
The game is down for 24 hour maintenance, presumably in prep for today, so no one is actually playing right now.
---
In europe its 8pm for the mainland (Netherlands, Germany, France, spain.) But i dont know the rest
---
Let em show their love for us Europeans.
---
You little fucking bastard I hope your raid team loses worlds first by 1 minute
---
It's just the title screen. Game should be down until this comment is six hours old.
---
You fool you fell for it

I was there when it was written.

If you're Europe then you have 2nd october

*cocks gun*
---
Then you're almost 6 hours behind us so even more!
---
does it say preload comeplete?
---
It would say that but not now
---
i no longer get the game is locked meseege it just dtarts to download it again :(
---
Sure is....I want to play so bad but just can't shell out another almost hundred dollars for it after taxes right now.
---
As Drewsky would say "Hunter, because I'm a one trick pony"
---
I thought shadowkeep dropped in an hour and a half?
---
I screenshotted the loading screen off a video on YouTube and then edited off the text. It’s possible we took the original picture from the same video. Also, if you look closely at the lines they don’t meet perfectly in some places because my editing isn’t perfect.
---
I still fail to see why that matters really.
---
After servers come back up, everything is being raised to 750 LL minimum. So you’ll be insta rly higher today when logging in
---
You are right in really just lazy
---
That was amazing! Such great mates. I really enjoyed reading that.
---
What the hell happened here?
---
Because people don’t seem to want to invest the time when they could be grinding for something themselves it seems like at times. But personally some of the most fun had in the game is being a Sherpa for a raid group or helping people reach fabled. I’m really excited for the new influx of players but hope they aren’t turned off by people wanting to stomp them and not help with quests
---
I don't remember how long ago you posted the first one, but god damn you've improved a lot in that time
---

I'm glad you enjoyed it!  I thought the community would enjoy the regaling of a valiant quest whilst we wait for maintenance to end.

She’s a keeper
---
I always play my hunter first, but my oldest boy is maiming hunter so I may go bubble titan, I’ve always enjoyed titan as an alt, and I love assault rifles which pair well with titans.
---
Thank you!
---
Hate to say this, considering I main Warlock/Hunter, but Titan is probably your best bet because of the supers (middle tree void, primarily, if you wanna focus on support)
---
It's only involved if your TV uses local dimming. I can look it up for you if you tell me the model number.
---
I'm probably going to grind power level to 900 with two kinderguardians. One of them have Shadowkeep the other as far as I know doesn't.
---
Already sent them the battleplan for a smooth leveling, and will be with them along the way. They probably will play until the hype dies out and the game become "a nice one to shoot things once in a while", but I don't care, they are my friends.
---
I feel like it’s because people don’t want to invest the time spent helping others when the could be grinding for something themselves, but personally some of the most fun I’ve had in the game is to Sherpa for a new raid group or help others reach fabled or finish an exotic quest. Really excited for the new influx of players but I hope they aren’t turned off by people wanting to stomp them in crucible and not help with raids/quest and things alike.
---
This 24hr downtime was probably for the best.
---
We must remember people like this exist.

IIRC it's impossible right now, but you'll be able to after Shadowkeep launches.

NP, remembered seeing it the other day

It’s ok it’s still early!
---
Very good and interesting i love this video because Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold.
---
Whenever I'm bored in crucible I go through his old videos to find some weird builds he's done to fuck around with. Also why the fuck is this downvoted
---
This was their (current) nickname in Discord.
---
That's why it's not crossed off.
---
I am the only one who prefer forsaken ost
---
Guh guh guh guh guh.....Google is your friend.
---
Doesn’t mean you can’t help out in public events and quests. You don’t have to carry them through everything but give tips or lend a helping hand when you can
---
He probably payed someone to get it for him
---
Cayde coming back has not been confirmed to be true. Thus this is not a spoiler, post approved.
---
yare yare daze
---
Yes.
---
Mine shows them as dlc but I can over bnet so I’m not sure if it’s cause if that
---
yeah, when i first started, crucible felt like a "only the toughest are allowed" type of thing, but thats why i like gambit, its like one of my favorite things to do on destiny
---
F***🤣
---
Yeah no, you can go to Benedict-9940 who boosts your power level to 690, then go to collections and craft blues until you’re at 750, probably could do it in 15 mins
---
Hell yeah!! Loving grinding with my buddies that are new to the game and helping them get those juicy powerful rewards. So excited to play tonight!
---
Imagine not dropping out of school just for the release of Shadowkeep smh
---
Sorry but you can go to Benedict-9940 who boosts your power level to 690, then go to collections and craft blues until you’re at 750, probably could do it in 15 mins
---
Whatever u say chief
---
I searched it up it says it's been free since September 17th and I see stuff that say it's free only on PS4 and I seen that its free today so idk that's why I came to Reddit I also can't download it rn but I guess it comes out in 4-5 hours??
---
Yes
---
Short answer, no.
---
Long answer, yes.
---
this as a print for my gamingroom...

You mean those ignorant dipshits who give negative comments because they are not up to date with the news regarding D2?

I've never seen a conversion bot actually get downvoted before lol

I’m going to run my warlock then titan then hunter so I can have my hunter the highest in preparation for the raid
---
fuck gamestop
---
Lmao you linked breitbart? I wouldn’t even uses printed papers of that website to wipe my own ass if it was the only thing I had. Let alone use it for actual news.
---
Same time as it does everywhere else just in the EU time zone.
---
Though honestly, I've already completed the story and brought the only character I really wanna play up to lvl 50 and ground out the legendary gear I want. So I'm most just waiting for the Halloween dlc.
---
Also, I completely understand that HC issue. I personally don't like the way HC feel except TLW and Thorn for some reason.
---
Nice
---
Yes you may. Warm your grips over the warmth of the Jotuun stove
---
I see you're a Guardian of culture as well. Long time Gunslinger Hunter because yeehaw.

Soooooo what clock?
---
I never said you were forcing anyone; don't twist my words. You're telling people, or "reminding them" to post "positive" reviews. Perhaps saying post "honest" reviews would've been less open to attack by people like myself who refuse to jump on this Bungie circle jerk.
---
The only time I every used bottom tree night stalker was when I accidentally equip it maybe it’ll be good now
---
I didn’t know any of that. That’s cool and will help for sure!
---
Best post I’ve seen today. Might have to hit up Tom’s Bistro for lunch before launch now!
---
The joke here is a skullfort titan using a gun
---
I have zero problems with killing him not because i hate him just Cayde shouldn't have to suffer
---
time to break the curse of balal!

If I were you i would have hope and see if it works when you go home,peace

Yes, that's correct. Yes I did buy it, and I stay playing it in hopes that it'll achieve the potential it has. One can be critical of the developer while maintaining hope, you know.
---
Yup same here , I just don’t do well with most of them besides a few , and I know it’s not my aim because I’m using snipers and slugs casually and do well with them (I’m kinda maining chaperone) I was doing well with Luna and NF but the nerf to them made them have awkward recoil
---
I have a fever..... ;)
---
It was a great expansion and with them delaying shadowkeep I got to enjoy one of my favorite games for just a little longer. Now I must return to the moon.
---
for a few hours of content overpriced, then go back to boring farm.
---
It's a choice between, fixed load out, separate stats for pvp or just unbalanced as fuck.
---
I think i did leave it on that screen for like 5 hours while watching yt on my phone
---
It's okay, Guardian. Shaxx loves us and that's really what counts.
---
Dude. I got a tooth infection and had to take a sick day to go to the dentist today. I should be out right before Shadow keep launches. Lord Bungo has bless us brother. 😂

yes it is which makes bst the correct time so having GMT on there as well surely would cause confusion as shown below?

You on PS4? I need guardians to run with!

---
Please give credit to the actual Twitter account
---
https://twitter.com/dustinkcouch/status/1057094474227240960?lang=en
---
Here is what I would do:
---
Story:
---
If you care about the story of Destiny then this part is pretty self explanatory. Just go ahead and play through the story. If in shadowkeep you find yourself too low of a power level to keep progressing or something then check then go ahead and level a bit (check below).
---
Leveling:
---
I don’t exactly know how shadowkeep is gonna change how leveling works (except that it’s gonna make it easier in some respects), but I can break it down based on how it worked before. 
---
Increasing your level (This section is only relevant if the level cap increases):
---
Doing literally anything gives you xp. If a new expansion came out and I got bored of doing the main story, but I still wanted to level then I would just do pvp. I found that to be the fastest/most enjoyable for me but it really doesn’t matter. If you complete the story then it should boost you to max level at the end. Completing the story should be your priority when you start playing since it unlocks additional content and brings you to the “normal” level cap
---
Increasing power level:
---
Increasing this will allow you to do higher power level activities such as the new raid or heroic versions of activities. There is a soft cap and a hard cap. I don’t know what the soft cap and hard cap is going to be in shadowkeep but basically until you reach the soft cap any gear that drops is going to be a higher power level than what you currently have. After that you will have to complete activities, bounties, and challenges that grant powerful gear in order to increase your power level. Completeing the daily/weekly challenges that appear on the map are the easiest way to increase in power level. 
---
Gear:
---
For this I recommend just watching some videos (when shadowkeep drops) that tell you what the best gear is, but here is a simplified explanation. There are two grades of weapons/armor you care about Legendaries and Exotics. All weapons have perks on it and the set of perks that are on a gun are referred to as a “roll.” What roll you get makes or breaks the gun. The roll you get on a gun is random for most legendaries. This is what makes the game grindy as getting a good roll on a certain gun you want is somewhat tough. I would just look up top ten pve or pvp guns on youtube or something and you should get a pretty good idea of what’s good. If you like any particular gun from one of the lists then just look up how to get it. Armor also rolls with perks/stats and a good roll for your build helps a lot if you want to optimize your build but your guns matter far more.
---
Check out mynameisbyf on YouTube
---
Thanks for letting me know about this -- unfortunately I can't really do anything about people copying content haha.
---
How did you find my Reddit username? That's so nice of you.
---
What circle jerk? Check out the curator's reviews on steam, and see how ignorant and misleading they are.
---
And why do you tjink that a recommendation cannot be honest?
---
Had a big area with stairs in the middle and a bunch of shriekers and a platform at the left and right that you had to hack or something.
---
I don't have the money for Shadowkeep so i can't but thanks anyways!
---
Damn, someone REALLY wanted to play shadowkeep.
---
Xbox :(
---
I was almost a victim. I'll be sure to send EVERYONES regards if I see him.
---
Forsaken didn't have any

My name is but made a good recap vid for d2 on YouTube. It's not necessary but it's cool.

Why not both?

Thanks &lt;3

Destiny 2 is free to play. With paid seasons. A lot more RPG elements than ever. Finishing moves. Basically the game we wantedn
---
My man.Making me head to bojangles before launch.lol
---
It's free on Steam. Starts in 2 hours.
---
Uh. Not at all.
---
About that...
---
It's less of a detailed plan, and more general guidelines. They are starting ahead of me (because of work) and I wanted them not doing any mistakes that would hinder their capabilities of reaching as close as RNG allows to 920 before raid launches.
---
In any case tough, here are the steps and general comments on them:
---
1) Get to 900 light. 
---
2) Get to 950 light. 
---
3) Get to 960 light.
---
For 750-900 any drop is a upgrade, including trade-ins with planetary materials/crucible and vanguard tokens. Probably campaign will help a lot on this but remember that Moon's recommended Light Level is 860, so if you want to beef yourself a bit before heading there, feel free. Lost Sectors and Public Events will give consistent loot, but avoid playlist strikes (do them directly from the planet) as to not waste rewards for the 900-950 bracket.
---
When you get to 900, it's time to tackle powerful rewards. Playlist strikes, crucible, gambit... whatever strikes your fancy.
---
the 950 to 960 is real endgame, and as far as I know no sources will be avaible at launch for this, still it will be Iron Banner, Raids and the new nightfall mode that should grant this increased light rewards.
---
Always remember that your artifact can give you power, and this guide is made for base gear power in mind. If you have any power gain from the artifact remember that it does not count for those brackets, and getting 895 gear + 5 artifact will not put you into the 900-950 gear bracket. You can always check this by mouse overing your power in the character screen as it will discriminate both there.
---
Happy Hunting guardian.

I need this in 4k

Only if he’s purchased forsaken first. If he hasn’t he won’t get the forsaken campaign. Which then unlocks the third class

It goes into crazy detail. It essentially goes back to the deepest depths of the lore, back to before guardians or anything even existed. It's really interesting and I highly recommend watching it when you get the time
---
Man I wish we had Bojangles where I live. When I'm in NC I hit them up all the time.
---
Hush now, my child, for I did not ask your opinion on anything.
---
Depends on the randoms honestly. Sometimes you get a great team sometimes you dont
---
No, just isn't funny or clever
---
That’s a dick move...
---
bl2 and 3 are literal trash.
---
ive been playing the remastered one, runs like butter.
---
When will servers go offline
---
nice
---
It could have been 79GB. I took a quick look after i set up the download and then left. I remembered it was between 70-80GB.
---
💀💀
---
OK, great. I understood that there were some challenges in the raid that require a high degree of team play?
---
*Hush shows up in game, starts shooting water guns into Guardians.*
---
Alright I'm back from defrosting,  thx man I appreciate the help ;)))
---
Wait did they actually write this?
---
You looking like absolute shit. Maybe you should go home. XD
---
Why avoid banking first?
---
You 2 together - Its Destiny, surely :P
---
I’ve been ready
---
I am so proud of this...
---
You would probably have to be in discord or some kind of voice chat
---
Destiny isn’t going anywhere. Put yourself in position to retire at 45 through a good education and you can game until you die.
---
When you start new light you’ll immediately be 750
---
leviathan is pretty easy, even if some people don't know what to do
---
I don’t get to play until tonight because I’m working😭😭
---
*Regicide resumes*
---
x game good fortnite bad
---
Enjoy your tendies
---
I see what you did there...
---
🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
I'm pretty sure all progress will transfer
---
Enjoy your cake
---
Yep you got it right.
---
When do the servers go back online? I thought it was suppose to be 10am but they're still down.
---
My colouring book has been quiet entertaining.
---
I never realized how fake thors axe and hammer look until right now
---
There is no benefit to getting Shadowkeep now, as you’ll be only doing the New Light content before it. Go through New Light first and see if it’s your jam
---
I really do believe that the intention of Bungie's post is more akin to "don't rage at people just because they are learning" and "be civil to everyone" than "stop everything you are doing and give up your schedule so you can become a full time Destiny teacher".
---
But I might be wrong.
---
BIRBS HAUNTED
---
I would play the base game first, see how you like it and then get shadowkeep if you enjoy what you've played. Wouldn't wanna waste your money if you dont like the game your playing. I've been playing since D1 so I'm basically a fanboy lol, I enjoy the game a lot but everyone is different.
---
I liked Diablo :c
---
I want to love Blizzard. I would have never in a hundret years thought theyd become what they have become.
---
It huts seeing people bash them but i also cant fault them for it.
---
Thank you for clearing that up.
---
You could go check the post. Lol.
---
I wouldn't have a clue what to do, Oo, but I need to do it for one of the challenges.
---
Sorry but no...
---
On twitter..
---
"Forsaken subclasses are only available with a Forsaken or Shadowkeep game license"
---
Lol. So I've heard.  Anyone know how much disc space is needed. I'm quickly chewing up my paltry 500gb
---
The 79 he downloaded was base game, shadowkeep is 28GB, but that doesn’t mean base game is 50. Shadowkeep (as far as I know), hasn’t been available to preload on pc yet, so all we have is the base game to preload
---
Borderlands 3 is fantastic.  
---
ill be playing both though.  Destiny 2 has become my main game when im not playing wow
---
I mean I thought it was. The original comment offers no substance and says “Destiny has more replayability” so I just said the opposite cause I’ve played more BL than Destiny.
---
Wonderfull work...
---
You have committed various war crimes and now cannot enter heaven as the result
---
Not at this time maybe next year or so.
---
Cross save
---
Im so mad. Im gonna miss the launch cuz I gotta deal with my kiddos medical equipment. Lol. But once I get this settled im gonna be on. Cant wait!!!! May the bungo Gods give you no loading ques, and I hope they have a smooth launch
---
I love this
---
uwu
---
Legendary
---
If money is not a factor, get it.
---
But Id say starting the f2p first to see if you like it and then if you do you can go all in
---
Mmm rainbow and destiny memes combining I like it
---
So high impacts are perfectly balanced then? Hmmmmm...
---
Destiny with both dlc and forsaken was 87g on steam. Guessing shadowkeep is another 15 min
---
Xbox——&gt;Steam
---
This.
---
You’ll get boosted to 750 with everyone else, we are all set!
---
Now you silence them. Peregrine outright kills them
---
Just did that for the last 10 mins then had to turn it off before I got depressed I can’t play until tomorrow.
---
I got an email from bungie yesterday saying the preloaded for shadowkeep was available for all platforms.
---
Credit to u/EpikRoan
---
No way, can't believe I nearly missed my cake day! Thanks! Lets play some destiny!
---
Good try 😂😂
---
It’s what he would have wanted
---
I did my preload after purchasing shadowkeep, and apparently it's the same size .
---
So I'll bet there's gonna be a few GBS patch and that will be all.
---
Idk then, all I know is that base game is 79GB alone while shadowkeep is 28GB
---
Yea, they definitly did .__.
---
750, better get up there, or read about shadowkeep and have your mind blown...
---
Didn't know that 😩😩thank you!
---
Controllers have a decent bit more recoil than on a mouse in an attempt to balance out aim assist. Hand cannons are notoriously the worst offenders, but their recoil pattern is getting updated today so it might not be as bad
---
Well you can sure bet there will some resentment from some players for the free stuff bungie has done. Meaning that it will be a “F them, why should I help all these newbies who weren’t here when it mattered” mentality’s.
---
if you dont like bl3 so be it.  it is what it is.
---
saying bl2 is trash is laughable though
---
I mean the last fight is going to be rough if ur not using discord. Calling signs to the people in main room by typing is your only option.
---
I get these playing marathons buy why it always has to be unhealthy food
---
I've been sitting here since it launched. It's different for everybody and on different systems. Could be 10 minutes or 3hours+. A lot of people are trying to get in.
---
So if I were to buy the expansion in PS Store I would get all previous content? Year 1, Forsaken etc?
---
No no no, coffee is black. No sugar, cream, ice or anything else ruining it. Black.
---
Yeah but it's all good, I got 6 minutes to go. Hopefully your HDD speeds up a little, you'll be in the game in no time my man.
---
They dropped the price because of this
---
really wtf? did you try restarting steam?
---
Thanks Bungo
---
Good communication and planning can make all the difference
---
I can't play until about 7:00 EST, we are all waiting at the moment.  Except a few lucky guardians who are unhaunting the moon as we speak.
---
Love to see it
---
Cries in HDD
---
I’m in
---
It's not that bad but I think it's also strictly worse than Steam.
---
Shadowkeep does not require any previous expansions in order to play, however, with the release of new light, the base game along with Curse of Osiris and Warmind are now free to any players. Forsaken was a major change in the direction the game went and you can currently get forsaken and the annual pass for around $40. Forsaken and the annual pass definitely renewed the playerbase and are worth playing as much as shadowkeep. Forsaken introduced weapons 2.0, bring back random rolls to weapons, and Shadowkeep is bringing armor 2.0, updating the armor system completely. The game has changed massively from D1 and even from D2Y1. I would definitely recommend picking back up the game again, where you choose to start is up to you.
---
But they are at capacity now
---
It's cool, maybe the servers will be open when you get home
---
It's got to decrypt the finals you downloaded
---
yes, from now you wont need to buy all dlc to play the recent ones
---
You ever waited in line to get into the amusement park? Same thing
---
Yes. You will miss some  of all of those things. All exotic from what I understand are free  except ones hidden behind raids and stuff
---
Bashing my head in with a hammer because it keeps going back to over a year for unpacking.
---
I timed it once. I think it’s something like a little over 30 seconds between Caydes ghost being destroyed and Cayde being shot. My record is 12 seconds. Cayde should have been saved
---
at least I am not the only one....
---
The servers are maxed (full)
---
It means you have a slow CPU.
---
Just wait you'll get in way too many people trying to connect at once.
---
What do you mean unpack like an archive? (I'm not home right now so I'm not looking at the game i just wanna be prepared)
---
Pretty sure 99% of console players are in a queue rn, that’s where I’m stuck :(
---
Yes and no. COO and Warmind will be free and all* areas can be patrolled. However, forsaken and Shadowkeep stories and exotics will be unlocked after you open your wallet or your butt cheeks however you pay things on this world. Lol jk.
---
We are in the same situation lol!
---
If your internet is faster than your hard drive delete d2 and reinstall it
---
Hand cannons, shotguns, auto rifles, smgs, and fusion rifles are all pretty good hip fire options
---
So no new trophies or achievements? Not even change that they get added soon?
---
FFS, you cannot sell uncomplete product, specially DLC this size and price.
---
Should know not to pre-order, after all trophies / achievements at Destiny 1 and 2 are most poor what I have ever encountered.
---
u/AshOfHyrule I thought you would enjoy this in particular
---
Ryzen 5 2600?
---
Yep, no more people allowed to join. That’s it forever.
---
should be working now i just did it
---
&gt; If there like a server limit to how many players can even be playing the game at once?
---
yea?? like, how do you think a server works? It's not magic. It has technological limitations
---
This is lame
---
Same here, was so hyped but steam hit me with this
---
Fucking hell thats what i get for not buying an SSD
---
This is common with many online games to queue players in a login-queue as to ease the stress on the servers.
---
Unpacking is taking a ridiculously long time, the hell was the point of preloading in the first place.
---
Yeah
---
Been stuck in a queue for 20 mins now. You ain’t missing anything.
---
It means the servers are full. Just be patient. I launched the game at 12:06. I got in at 12:18.
---
Ah okay. I’d never preloaded on steam before so I didn’t know that was a thing
---
Hahahahaha
---
Wondering the same thing. Just got into the game and I have to create a new character even tho I set up the crossave feature 1 month ago
---
Dunno, it took me out of the queue 2 times.. both my friends are already in that I’ve been waiting with.
---
Hopefully no queue after the unpacking for pc players lol
---
i read that all characters will start with 750 level
---
Now that it's available on steam if you copy/move your old Destiny 2 directory to your steamapps/common directory before installing, it will discover the existing files and save a lot of time. It saved me from needing to download about 60GB of the total 80GB.
---
Update Bungie hates me :
---
https://imgur.com/a/jNqYJlx
---
Shadowkeep and Forsaken are completely standalone from one another. Forsaken, however, does come with all the annual pass content that was released after it up until Shadowkeep. Hope this helps.
---
So quick question, I am level 30 on my character atm, I haven't bought/done forsaken campaign should I do it first or buy shadowkeep and play it as it is going to be more popular atm?
---
im sure my time in line will come in an hour after ive unpacked T\_T
---
Not the fastest, but not the worst.
---
It's sad how accurate this is.
---
I never timed it but that's interesting
---
Why would Bungie make a multiplayer game but not enough servers for the players? Wtf lol. That's so stupid
---
Its to be expected honestly. There is potentially millions of players trying to get into the game at once. Servers arent made by gods, they have limits.
---
First, I must unpack the game for 30 minutes and then play it for 5 minutes and then remind myself how to write reviews for the 58th time
---
No it’s just an expansion to the base game afaik
---
yeah i guess im not going to be playing today........
---
HDD: I’m gonna ruin this mans whole day
---
Even if you do get in, you get “destiny is currently at capacity”
---
Im in a queue and im like??? THEYRE GONNA KEEP ME WAITING!!!!
---
i feel like my nvme should unpack faster than 70mb/s but no, thanks steam
---
Just refreshed the page and it’s up and running again thanks mate
---
Yea, i got 1 hour on my SSD. Weird shit.
---
Forsaken is its own DLC, so you have to buy it separately unless it stated by Bungie that it is free. The based game is free with all year 1 DLC contents.
---
Oh well. Suppose I’ll just play league until it’s done lol
---
Steam is unpacking the game files. I’m not a tech guy but I believe when you download something you also have to unpack it to be able to be used. Since destiny 2 is 80gb it’s taking ~30 mins with an SSD and a couple hours with a HDD
---
Nooooo iced, 3 shots, 1 pump vanilla...heaven in a cup
---
I’m hoping that isn’t the case when I log in today
---
Sick 🌕
---
That's great news! That will probably get me back into it! Thanks.
---
Holy fucking shit. People in the internet really are whiny babies. Hurry up and go leave a negative review. You seem the type.
---
So why do the guys gotta look like walking lunchboxes?
---
What does your son love you to do?
---
Do you understand the immense network architecture they are currently switching on so impatient people like you can play?
---
Yes, everything you own (characters, guns, armor) are all getting boosted to 750 to sort of even the playing field for old and new guardians alike.
---
🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
---
As compensation for the weapon being locked, or as a joke because the weapon is locked.  Those are my guesses.  But it looks cool regardless.
---
Lot people here never played MMOs in day 1 releases. If you get to play today in any capacity consider yourself lucky.
---
About 5 minutes for me. Just got in while coming here to see if anyone else was having the same issue.
---
Get fucking wrecked
---
Yeah I agree you are.
---
I got this too, whats the point pre-loading then?
---
I think it’s just your hard drive unpacking it all since steam encrypts their pre loads
---
All gear and characters will start at 750 light
---
Windows on a Mac. Bold strategy Cotton
---
D2 is now F2P. That means Osiris and Warmind are included with the base game for free. If you want everything, you'll want to buy Shadowkeep deluxe for 4 season passes and Forsaken separately.
---
Where at on the moon?
---
Ah shit thanks. I didn’t even notice that
---
For the Colonel.
---
you can, go see Amanda, she might have it.  Otherwise maybe Spider.
---
you can and have to start forsaken over.
---
My precious.  Cant wait to get her back.
---
I hope in south korea otherwise Kim Jong Un is smashing on the moon right now while you are fucked
---
Ya I did but I had assumed I had already cross saved ):
---
Phew! I will try thanks so much!

Im doing the shadowkeep campaign rn.

What does it do again?

Ah yes, our Glorious Leader is indeed protecting us from the Nightmares of the Moon! /s

Beats me!

Character сustomization, as i said in russian below, so guy who dont like my grammar cannot understand because he is ignorant bitch, i can translate it for you so you understand.

"Okay, I can talk to you in my own language, if it’s more convenient for you, I meant that in any MMO today you can configure EVERYTHING, well, except for WOW, which is backward in this regard and will not change anymore, authenticity is everything.

And I'm not talking about the height, weight or size of the chest, but at least the face? Why can't I make a hero who doesn't look like a grandmother?

Thanks for answers."

I fucking love you

On the moon/hellmouth near 1st story banner
---
Me too, sorry bad english here, i was only lvl 3 now i dont have the mission im was doing before destiny come to steam, im very lose
---
Hey I shit on Bungie all the time for this (and get a lot of hate), saying I hate how they charge whats honestly a crazy price, for recycled content. I'm on the game now but I haven't bought the new DLC. It's crazy to think year 3 DLC will cost $60 and we just get the moon from D1 back. Oh and still no trials
---
If they made no mention why would you assume they’d let two people pay half price?
---
did you ever find out from another source?
---
Or heavy Machine guns
---
You should see the meme version of this with the exact same wording.
---
Why should I play a game that I paid release pricing for and then chose to put on a shelf for 2 years, when newcomers can buy it brand new for $20 at Gamestop?!?!?
---
i guess, i have to live with \*\*\*\*\*Blood now
---
I have the same thing on Xbox One
---
I got 'kicked' to orbit 3 times with diffrent codes then 'kick' all togeather.
---
MOON’S HAUNTED MY GUY
---
Same here. Says i have zero characters  on my xbox cross save.
---
*INDEED*
---
Everything is free to play besides shadowkeep and forsaken. You can buy and play shadowkeep without forsaken or with
---
Yea thats it, but i already got   answer that " helmet is always on" so whatever i guess.
---
[twitch.tv/probablystratus](https://twitch.tv/probablystratus) for more amazing content
---
I'm not a new player per se, more of a returning one...I had made some progress in forsaken (I think). I had 2 more wanted enemies to go before Shadowkeep was released and now it is making me play the opening mission (Last Call I think it is called) over again. I can't see any other missions on the map other than shadow keep stuff and I'm a bit confused.
---
Does anyone know why this has happened?
---
Sitting behind NAT, impossible to get into tower.. beaver,fig (on bnet it still worked, less groups sure but it worked). So I guess wait until Bungie does something... :S
---
I am so fuckin fired up so my comments are definitely filled with unfettered spite but hell yeah I did. 
---
I'm a Synthocep titan so punching is my game so Monte Carlo is such a powerful weapon to me. 
---
It takes only like one magazine to refill my melee, this thing is stupid powerful.
---
Basically purgatory
---
One moment please...
---
On Xbox I needed to go to the game management and install the Shadowkeep 30mb thing seperately.
---
I keep getting error code beaver when I try to connect to the tower
---
FOUND A FIX
---
YOU HAVE TO HAVE LESS THEN 275 FRIENDS, I DELETED A BUNCH AND NOT IT WORKS
---
Not to mention bungie said this would come with buying Shadowkeep as season of the undying is part of it so it’s like getting the season with the Shadowkeep expansion but not getting any of the items that come with it
---
You push down right stick
---
Same here😅
---
I might be a bit late guys got some issues currently
---
Well frick
---
it ran on highest settings before they moved to steam...
---
Karma lol
---
I will backup your backup *revoker reloads itself*
---
You can have the helmet off in social spaces, it's in the options tab. 
---
Helmet is always on, is a reference to Lord Shaxx and his sordid sexual escapades. (You've got a couple years of memes to catch up on.)
---
because a large amount of the files will be different, such as eververse and almost all social changes
---
Have you tried turning it off and on again?
---
Meaning in this case, sign out and sign back in for everything.
---
Seems fake. Nobody just randomly writes this on someone’s cup
---
That's sick, I started using synthoceps a couple weeks ago
---
This is ridiculous.
---
I am getting same problem and my friends too, have you found any fixes or heard anything
---
In all fairness, if it was a whole month prior are you sure it's the entire game and not a placeholder? I'm not a PC player but that's what they usually do on console
---
Jade Rabbit?
---
Jade rabbit perhaps?
---
I’m glad I’m not alone 😭
---
i found how to play without crash now . you need remove some friend from steam friend list it more than destiny can handle and keep crash keep friendlist &lt; 250
---
seems they forgot to upgrade the servers for steam release
---
I did. Twice in fact. I guess ill check again tomorrow.
---
Port forward worked for me pretty easy to do just look it up and how to do it with your modem
---
Obviously they think your osama bin ladin
---
Oh, I see, go visit Eris, she’ll have some stuff for you
---
You're not gonna get anything in return sorry.
---
As for dlc, curse of Osiris and warmind are now included in the base game (so you have access to them now) and the year 2 annual pass is now bundled with the forsaken dlc (which still costs money).
---
Gives me an timeout error whenever i load cross save up now. I cant play D2 on steam at all too, tells me servers are down.
---
No idea. Maybe I'm just dumb. It does also say that it's not available when I go to it in my library though.
---
It is bunny, always significant
---
Yes, as long as your PSN id is the same you can put it on multiple consoles, the key is tied to your ID.
---
Bungie put that word out and so did youtubers
---
Bruh if that works i just uninstalled the game
---
You aint doing shit
---
If you’re game sharing, I believe you recieve the deluxe items but not the actual passes if it wasn’t bought on your account.
---
You need to authenticate 2 accounts ie 1 PC 1 PS4 first
---
I’m waiting
---
Shut the fuck up. Lmao
---
Why anyone would have that many friends i don't know.
---
There was several warnings upon login for the last few weeks that all inventory, bounties and quests would be affected.
---
It didn’t tell me how many I only had to wait like 3 mins on PS4
---
Hard pass
---
Once Web Publishing is done I’m bout to speed my ass home
---
You'll get in. Goin off how its usually played out the hype will peter out as far as flooding the server and shit should move forward nice n easy.
---
(I'm in the same boat and this response is pure denial)
---
These are the chests from TTK. No clue about their significance, but that's definitely a dreadnaught chest.
---
Any idea for PC? I'm equally lost and can't find it in my binds
---
Grapes everywhere!
---
It’s hard to try to log in hundreds of thousands of players trying to access the game at the same time for hours on end, the servers themselves in game are fine
---
When I logged in I had to hold down the mouse to accept some cross save option but because I did that I don’t think I can get cross save to work now.
---
Might be a throwback to one of the first emblems you received in D1 as it was stashed in a dark corner on the moon.
---
I love this game, but that's been an issue since 2014!  Your mad cause you know its true.
---
Took me about 20 min to get on, that was right at 1pm est on PS4
---
iirc campaign missions can have a max of 3 people, have the same issue here.
---
I also got the cerberus 5 minutes later
---
Same for me seems to be a major bug
---
If you had it on battle net you'll have it on steam, there's just a delay for everyone regarding forsaken license transfers.
---
Understandable have a good one
---
What? There are lots of games that have quit or cancel options if you're placed in a queue. The point is so you're not stuck there staring at a loading circle for who know how long and are free to close the game and go elsewhere.
---
We don't even get info like expected wait time or where our place in the queue is. It's just poor design. Even if this sort of thing isn't supposed to happen it should be prepared to handle it IF it happens.
---
Sounds like a typical modern server based game on launch day to me
---
Better put a Spoiler alert on that link
---
Well now I know how console players feel
---
Idk why I love this meme even though I hate the show it's from.
---
Haven’t seen this screen in 2 years, and here we are.
---
Ummmm.. I posted this myself, taken on my camera, on my tv!!! And it’s a joke... jeez
---
there is 100k on pc and alot more on ps4 and xbox idk what u expect
---
I want to kill myself
---
Obviously, but that would be awesome though, would have made that grind doubly worth it.

My anger clouded my judgement, I can now see that we can all be Best Buds.

Man, when that scream went off on titan...
---
They aren’t down. They’re at maximum capacity. It’s 4 o clock Eastern on a weekday. Everyone just got off school and/or work and the game just went free to play. It’s gonna be like this for a good little while
---
Same. I dont think i kept my sniper kills in crucible either lol

couldn't agree more, them stupid n00bs don't even know what the recluse is

Got to get past the the loading screen to actually play it so I can give it a review!

Shadowkeep is a DLC for the Free Game, Destiny 2 : New Light..

It’s at capacity, no one is DDOSing.

This is me right now

I’m about to log back into fo76 and play till I’m out of que lol
---
Delay console wise or pc only?
---
Amanda Holliday is how you start older campaign content
---
What?
---
People have been waiting over an hour lol
---
You preordered a limited edition of a game and didn’t know it was going f2p...?
---
Not today I’m guessing
---
I've been sitting on it for an hour as well. I understand that these things happen but this is just ridiculous.
---
Somebody’s doing bad juju...
---
Saw one as well :O
---
Exactly. Just let them in after first day raids are over.
---
You are just plain STUPID
---
Well. Shit lmao
---
He is being a baby, you shouldn’t expect a AAA title to be perfect when it comes out just like you shouldn’t expect the line at a brand new marvel movie to be short. Shit happens and bungie is doing there best to work on it, the negativity coming from the whiny players doesn’t help. There is no way to account for your player base increasing 8x, just chill out and wait your turn like everyone else. I’ve been playing this game since the day destiny 1 came out, the game has never been this big.
---
Yeah would have made rhw grind well worth it. I donno why I thought it was haha.
---
I’ve never seen it this bad before, why should we act like it’s “normal.” It isn’t.
---
Ah ok was just worried \^\^ - im not playing atm anyway so thats fine for me i guess
---
In the middle of a cutscene I was put into the "One moment please..." screen. I am still there to this day
---
Nobody should be shamed for wanting their game to work. Just saying.
---
I was in the game and got kicked 😭
---
just for this ill leave the client running in the background instead of waiting with it off
---
It’s like they want the game to die, the issue here isn’t free to play people it’s lack of preparation. Hopefully they fix it soon.
---
sad day brothers.
---
No, you misinformed yourself.
---
I have to imagine the people actually playing aren't gonna spend time on the subreddit bragging about it
---
Servers are down so..you're not missing out in much.
---
Have a safe trip home.
---
I was in queue for 45 minutes. Finally got to the character selection screen. **Weasel**. Back in queue.
---
Good stuff.
---

There's a delay in the transfer from bungie to steam, as that's the only platform movement happening

Can you just stop replying already. I told you I’m done.
---
Imagine being surprised a popular live service game has server issues at launch. You act like a spoiled brat that didnt get their ice cream for dessert. 
---
like no shit there is server issues, hundreds of thousands of people all trying to log in at once
---
More than 750k+ are trying to play all at once so I see why the servers had a little issue.
---
I agree mate, I watched the whole 4h. Don’t regret it after the campaign so far
---
Why ?
---
That's how I feel but I know it's mean af lol been waiting for this and I get booted during the first campaign mission and now I can't sign back in.
---
Yes bungie we are paying to you
---
One moment please more like one hour please AMIRITE FELLAS
---
Hey! You aren’t playing the same game I’m not playing!!!
---
THE HAMSTERS. THEY NEED TO KEEP RUNNING.
---
What other games???
---
The point of a queue is to stay in it isn’t it? 
---
If you want to leave a game:
---
PC: hit x
---
Console: hit home
---
I have been waiting since 5am UK time to play and now I got time to go on the xbox this happens, god dammit
---
Least u got to play...lol
---
Rest of us, not so lucky
---
Imagine thinking server capacity is a bigger issue than people not receiving currency they spend REAL MONEY on.
---
I updoot this.
---
...so I wouldn't feel like everything's made out of paper? Because I'd prefer that, honestly.
---
Oh shit i got the same!
---
Psst hey buddy, I’ll pay you $10 to log off so I can get outta this queue
---
People are being kicked because the game is now free to play plus there’s new DLC, there’s gunna be a lot of people trying to play and majority of them are now stuck in a queue due to how many people there is.
---
3hrs then I did, still out
---
Yeah. I honestly expected this, though. A huge influx of returning *and* new players? Oh yeah
---
has nothing to do with that, bungie intentionally put a limit on the servers today to make sure they didnt explode
---
I get it man, I'm just trying to keep the sub clean. Part of the rule encompasses duplicate/over-posted content. If you take a look at the sub sorted by newest you'll see a flood of same/similar posts.
---
Sorry for being a downer, I know you're just trying to have some fun in this dark time of long queues. Hopefully we can all get in soon!
---
Me too!!! I was in for like 10 minutes and got kicked now I've been sitting at the log in screen for an hour
---
It's not just that, bear in mind they also made it free-to-play for everything beyond Shadowkeep, that's a huge amount of players flooding in.
---
I preordered in July so suck my diode in the forward bias position
---
Totally agree i wann aprepare for the damn raid
---
True, got about three hours in
---
I don’t think they want him, the person, canonically in he game, but more for him to maybe voice a lore master character... not just some dude named Byf standing around. 
---
But idk, I’m guessing like you... honestly the man had a solid voice and could probably pull it off but I doubt it’ll happen... maybe as an Easter egg.
---
i went in to today with the intention of being one of the people that helps drag the servers down by playing. i guess it worked
---
And now The servers are not available instead
---
Frfr
---
Wiat so what with a waesal and the servers
---
&gt; most people are playing
---
That’s so good, that’s at least 3 moments
---
Wtf
---
15392 i got kicked then tried to join again (sigh)
---
Come on it’s just a little image that I took for something I’m not the only one facing right now and am not the only one to post something like this that wasn’t screen captured professionally
---
I'm going to point to this Reddit post next time I want to explain why I don't think everyone needs to be in college.
---
Will do.  Was dropped and been in que since posting originally.
---
I was on the Moon for dozens of minutes! Believe little light
---
I got to 1 then it kicked me started over
---
Okay sorry but 1) New Light doesn't get Forsaken
---
2) Every player should be allowed, it's your choice to support Bungie 3) Why buy Forsaken a week before Shadowkeep? 4) Don't be an ass and be patient like all of us.
---
Glad I shot up from 2,000 to 9,500.
---
lol, mine moved from 11521 to 10230.....then to 10851! Two steps forward one step back!
---
Update:
---
Now I’m 15,146
---
Lol yeah I’m going up in que hahaha it’s pretty funny actually
---
Jesus
---
Yea it seems like things are moving. Went from 1901, 632, 200, to in game in about 10 minutes.
---
Forsaken isn't free, and Destiny isn't the only game that has server issues on launches. There's 30k+ people all trying to connect to a server at the same time. It doesn't matter if the server can handle 30k people playing, everyone joining at once is a bit harder. AAA games have server issues on release too. You just have to deal with it.
---
I never had any of the DLC, so I would need to do a transfer to play my characters? They don't just transfer in to Shadowkeep?
---
Who dis? What does he do?
---
Cause this is Thraller, Thraller night
---
15244
---
15,000 gang where you at
---
Haha. Mine is 6666
---
I got in, and it immediately kicked me back out just now.
---
I saw it when Destiny 2 first released
---
7959
---
This should be today’s loading screen.
---
thanks bungo
---
Ok thanks for the help
---
Unknown Players number is 232 at that moment.
---
Hey I’m close! 12034
---
All the servers have been taken ofline. There is no waiting. Let them do their job. This was expected. And forsaken is not one of the free things.so you should read before talking my man
---
I went from 5590 to 14121 for some reason. I never closed the game but it's tough to believe that things are moving.
---
so they never learn, like the Fallen in the Arsenal Walker event.
---
I was at 10k...now I'm at 16k+. Wtf.
---
I got in, got error code weasel and got put at 16,229. Why, god? Why.
---
Mine went to 0, acted like it was signing in, then I got a weasel error and got bumped back to 16k looool. Best to just wait it out and not to get your hopes up.
---
I’d wait to do anything like that until servers are back up.
---
Y1 Destiny is free, aside from a few other activities, but Forsaken is ***not*** free. Also, you’ll be fine. 
---
I’ve bought and played every expansion since D1 and don’t feel entitled to have priority over anyone else.
---
17225
---
Looks awesome! I'm glad someone's enjoying the downtime lol
---
Nothin
---
Oh god I’m sorry
---
The servers are down currently
---
Days even
---
I'm at 9873, started from like 11200. Wud b interesting if it goes to 0 and kicks me out. I'm expecting it
---
All the servers are down atm. They are doint a maintenance for all servers again atm. You can follow on Twitter
---
I’m moving in line as well .....  good time to grab a snack though
---
Hmmmm.... something’s fishy
---
Servers are offline check bungies twitter for info and updates.
---
731
---
I mean everything has limits, and the fallen just have a surplus of walkers
---
Everyone who is less than 10k quit and see if my position goes down!
---
God loves a trier!
---
I’m currently at 15284 🤮
---
6000? I'm at 17849 rn
---
16k gang where you at?
---
You mean the annual pass went free. Forsaken isn't free.
---
1784 and declining!!!
---
this just gives me time to watch the 4 hour story recap :-)
---
i’m not really that upset, we are getting a much bigger player base so i would say it’s a problem with a cause i’m not to mad about.
---
Now 7361 :p
---
yea we know
---
No that’s how the game works sorry
---
Wait until you get down to 0, you jump up thousands lol
---
Ohhh wow never would of guessed thanks ( I’m new to PC )
---
I gave up at 21079
---
Man, this looks like a robot chicken bit. The lighting is wild
---
go buy a scratch off .. maybe you win something :)
---
youll have the characters but u need to buy the dlc on both
---
Only saves transfer. Purchased content does not.
---
Correct
---
I'm not asking for money or my money back it was worth the money that i spent but i feel ripped off now that people don't have to pay to get the same experience I had. It would be nice if the devs took more notice to the people that did support them instead marking us and the people just downloading the game because its labeled as free in the same group. kinda like a hey I've been here since day 1 type of thing.
---
Seriously?! This is crazy. Must the servers are haunted. Moon is fine
---
My lie?  The fact that I typed in "when does destiny 2 become free" in google?  Every article on the front page refers to the pc version.  So after 10 minutes of reading articles that don't mention anything but the pc version I got on reddit to get an answer from this sub, and got it within minutes.  yet, instead of just ignoring this post (and the 2 others you left toxic comments on within minutes of each other), you decide to be an ass.  Is it really that hard to ignore these posts?  I'm assuming hundreds of others do.  But nah, let's act toxic instead.
---
I wonder if people were like this 30 years ago...
---
Hey man, can I get the time? Nah screw you I bought this watch myself.  Go look for a clock hanging on a wall somewhere.  Damn uneducated people always wasting my time....
---
Smh.  I won't reply to you any further. Have a good day.
---
Expansions unfortunately do not work with cross save, you need to buy them on each platform you'd like to play them on.
---
Sometimes it displays and sometimes it doesn’t
---
PlayStation?
---
Damn I would just close the game and wait till next week lmao
---
God I laughed at this one haha, great movie too. Wait you guys are getting paid?
---
Then don't be the 1000th person with the same post.
---
Go to bungie.net/pcmove
---
Just be glad you aren't 70000
---
Is the queue supposed to go down at all while you wait?
---
Damn
---
i have already done the cross save thing a few weeks ago. i'm scurd it's going to f it up if i accept
---
No. You get all of the Y1, and a bulk of the Y2 activities, for free. Now, I say *activities* because some of the loot is behind the pay wall. So you can partake in the activities, but can't get the full range of rewards from them.
---
You start New Light at the Y3 baseline power: 750. This will be well over the Power cap for any of the Y1/2 content.
---
Just wait it's unpacking the pre-downloaded files. It takes a bit of time . Mine was 40+minutes.
---
It worked fine for me on ps4 
---
It loaded at least
---
It just kicked me no bs
---
Is there even that many people waiting?
---
Exactly. Everyone is posting the same image. We do not need to see it again.
---
No compensation.
---
Jesus Christ man
---
I'm 100 behind you lol
---
I actually got in without waiting in queue lol
---
They are at capacity not down. Learn to read the game
---
That’s how mine was and I got kicked back into orbit for some reason.
---
I agree with this person, props to you keep up the good service of announcement.
---
Spoiler the gun sucks
---
This - played D2 release but haven’t touched it since.
---
Thanks for your opinion, my over thousand hours over the last two years of D2 are well worth what I've paid.
---
PvP has normalized damage, so two weapons of the same archetype do the same damage. Only difference it perks and most perks can roll on any gun
---
It doesn’t even send me back it just reloads me back to eris.cant load into the tower either
---
Ok so this guy just isnt allowed to make a post about the servers?
---
I don't think it's unfair and I didn't hit 750 until like 2 weeks ago. I think Bungie realized that their leveling system was complete garbage so they're allowing players to skip that " x powerful reward attempts per week " nonsense and go straight into grinding the relevant content. Or even being able to immediately jump into forges or do dreaming city stuff with their friends instead having to do weeks worth of grinding before hand.
---
How did Bungie not anticipate this? Why couldn't they just get more servers to prepare for this?
---
Good question. I’m currently on attempt #2. Not sure if I can get in. Is there a zero percent chance or what.
---
dam... i mean you can still play the game, soooooooo i still envy you
---
The digital Deluxe includes seasons 8, 9, 10, and 11. It's a years worth of content.
---
Overall it's cost me £180 for the game and all DLC. Also this isn't acceptable after releasing a £50 expansion. So if I've paid for something and I'm not getting it, I'll bitch however much I like.
---
I meant just for Destiny. You know, just log out for this game, not that much change or dificulty.
---
Actually, I think some people are in based on streams I saw, servers are not perfect, but I think at least some of them are up
---
hey
---
did u photoshop this??? I have reason to believe this image may have been manipulated
---
They don't have that either...
---
Yea I made it and someone put it on Twitter and bungie made it the megathread banner for Destiny The Game
---
Is like hitting your head against a brick wall to stop the voices in your from talking to you. Its works once.
---
Oh, this is REALLY rich.  
---
Not only was I #11239 in the queue, but apparently you need to keep showing signs of activity of else you'll get booted for inactivity... which, when I logged on again, I found out I was now at frigging #15000+!
---
C'mon Bungie, you knew this day was gonna be huge, why weren't you ready for the F2P Steam hordes?!
---
There's nothing
---
They do, they also have a twitter called Bungie Help that is related to it
---
If you are talking about when you kill the nightmares, the buff gives extra damage to nightmares
---
I thought pay to win applies to lootbox functions, not actual dlc, which most of the fanbase has anyway.
---
So, there’s the 3 that open. The top will open first, and then when and only when it’s destroyed will the next one down open, and so on. Does that help?
---
I agree with this person
---
Not sure how I proved your point as you just tried to justify your comment that failed to answer a basic question (surprising considering your an adult). But anyways, Try to reflect on your answers before posting to avoid making a fool out of yourself. Peace out Guardian.
---
Omnigulls back? Fuck yeah
---
one of my revolvers has increased damage for first  shot, is that then an ability i can look to buy or make for other weapons? essentially making my self a similar weapon as the legendary weapon ? thats the idea?
---
I got kicked out of queue at 4400, network error my ass. I love this game but this is frustrating as hell.
---
Me too
---
Mine was like 5 mins.
---
I don't begrudge new lighters playing for free, but I sure as hell would like to play the content I paid for
---
It was a fun 25 minutes' worth of gametime before I was locked out entirely. Definitely worth the $100+ my wife and I spent on the DLC. I'm just glad all of Bungie's favorite streamers get to play all day still while the rest of us paying customers get to sit around and watch. Great times.
---
Honestly tho 😂
---
They should have planned for this
---
Because you have access to them silly one. New light lets you patrol all locations now
---
Pretty sure anyone can free explore the areas now. Just can’t do the activities
---
It wouldn't be too bad I suppose, if they showed you where you were in the queue
---
Same for everyone else
---
mine hasnt moved ever since the 3 hours ive been queued. ive been in a couple different ones and theyve never changed.
---
"smells faintly of ... carrots"
---
Agreed. Was really excited to play tonight after I got home from work, but found out that I had to unpack the preloaded content, which took about an hour. Kinda annoyed, but decided to check out the subreddit in the meantime to see what people were saying about it. 
---
Nope, servers are down and there's a line of tens of thousands of people waiting to get in...
---
Is anyone actually getting online?
---
All locations are unlocked as of today.
---
You buy the deluxe to get all.  Basic dlc you just get the first season
---
Entitled child
---
This gif Physically pains me, I Miss my robot husbando
---
Also 750 is base power now so everything will be at least 750
---
Hahaha yes! I was 98. Saw steps to reboot on twitter and I'm now at 2050. It hasn't moved for 2 hours lol
---
It's the login/authentication servers. Only player movement/actions is handled via P2P.
---
Yeah, fair. It’s never been this bad before and anyone implying it’s normal is delusional. It’s actually scary they have a “at capacity” notice already created, like, they anticipated this?
---
They have opened some activities from Forsaken for players such as new light players. They can access stories, strikes and such but they cannot access the higher end activities like the last wish raid
---
are you dumb
---
*sobs quietly in the corner*
---
I believe they said it will be in the Heroic Mission rotation
---
The weapons will likely be available to everyone from certain activities after the season. Probably Vex Offensive if I had to guess, so not completely P2W, at least compared to something like CoD.
---
They made the forsaken areas unlocked so people could do stuff in those destinations, think like how you couldn’t give Petra cookies during Christmas if you didn’t have forsaken
---
Imo yeah but it depends what kind of games you like, the gunplay is some of the best around and feels great and against the ai the game makes you feel powerful
---
The pvp is fun and can be competitive but the heavy weapons and super abilities you can use stop it from being completely skill based
---
The story ingame is just alright but if you're into looking into the lore it's pretty interesting stuff
---
The raids are 6-man and are all pretty great, only drawback is theres no ingame matchmaking for it you have to either know people already or look on discord or an lfg site
---
The endgame is good but only if you like a loot grind and repeating the same activities to power yourself up
---
I was at 29,557
---
uhhhhh no. Impossible.
---
holy shit can this meme be any more unoriginal?
---
This needs to go on their Twitter feed  - they could probably use a laugh now!
---
please provide update if it worked
---
D1, D2, and all the expansions? Very possible.
---
73...b0aty reference? 🤔
---
Is that the ones that flow red? I haven’t been paying attention to names.
---
I do not mind a queue. But if you go to the trouble of building a queue fucking stand by it. This is like flying on standby.
---
It's also a handcannon that uses *special ammo*.
---
That fixed it.
---
Lol no worries, you can’t get in anyways
---
The login and inventory servers.
---
Moon’s haunted.
---
Funny how those numbers work huh
---
Give Bungie a chance.  You know those guys are more disappointed, especially when they worked hard on it.  More than money, it’s their sense of accomplishment on the line.  Pretty sure this is nerve wrecking for them.  Once again, just hang on tight.
---
Or get in only to get weaseled.
---
You can grab it in collections btw
---
Kick ass! Thanks guardian[, it looks slick af!](https://i.imgur.com/dvjE20Z.jpg)
---
It could also mean that the servers will be down for like 3 days
---
Just play when normal people on pst and cst go to bed lol. That's what I do
---
You are what's wrong with this inudustry. Sucking firmly on the cocks of those who do not care about the consumer.
---
That explains why there are so many
---
Is Forsaken still worth buying, especially if I got Shadowkeep?
---
This is gold
---
This meme makes no sense. The servers get full. It happens
---
Considering I made the meme myself... You can exit stsge right now.
---
They should have had an Estimate of Guaranteed players by the Amount of PreOrders. Mistakes were made
---
So wait. Can I move my Xbox acct to pc now?
---
I do get that part, I mean it will be cool to play with some of my friends who will be playing Destiny for the first time. It's definitely easier to get into, and I agree the leveling system isn't all that good. BUT for those of us who put long hours...it sucks.
---
I'll leave this comment here I would like to know if I have to rebuy forsaken as well or not
---
What size monitor is that?
---
I got in. Restart app and go through queue again.
---
You don’t have the last 2 dlc’s and the weapons armor that are from those are not obtainable for you unless you buy the dlcs
---
I guess that just means you lack creativity? This is a shit tier meme.
---
That’s so great
---
Cross save doesn't include content purchased, only your actual progress. If you bought your DLC on Xbox, you'll only be able to play that DLC on Xbox.
---
Gotta get GOG now to round the list out.
---
