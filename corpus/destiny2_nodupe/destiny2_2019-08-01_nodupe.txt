Rubber banding?

---
---
Calling it "sever" is an overstatement. There are lots of weapons that aren't exotic that you can use for ad clear, not as efficient, but by no means do they put you at a disadvantage. The real problem with pve is stuff like well of radiance, that's what puts you at a disadvantage if you dont have it
---
Middle tree is definitely the best
---
Once you get the legendary solstice armor, those armor pieces with different perks can drop from the solstice packages.
---
Honestly
---
Alternatively, like OP‚Äôs picture, if eight bullets fire and nobody hits anything, that whole team should be ashamed.
---

---
Lately it feels like everyone uses a sniper and deathballs, and someone has to die. And whoever gets the kill thinks they‚Äôre a god, but someone was going to hit the shot out of the 4-6 teammates all aiming at the same guy.
---
you know if it as anything to do with destroying that solar crystal ?
---
I am speed
---
I main Titan but I'm trying it out with the hunter
---
I am aware that the "severe disadvantage" statement has not aged well.
---
I don‚Äôt think recluse will get nerfed, it‚Äôs not exactly Op, just good situationally. I use it way more in PvE than PvP to be honest.
---
BIG F
---
I don‚Äôt believe so they just give you an orb boost I think
---
So you can get back from collections is what you're saying?
---
When you waste all your ammo killing one Minotaur because it keeps teleporting
---
I got mine on Sunday, so tell me brother, what're your thoughts on it
---
Ok, thanks alot üòä
---
same but looks cool :D
---
So I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs best to just hold on to them for now, correct?
---
That's the only thing I'll be able to afford this damn event since there is no freaking event engram
---
Damn, very impressive. Just curious, if you had to rank them in order of easiest to hardest, how would it go?
---
Screw these quest steps Gambit is fun but since I have to play it it's so dreadful
---
Personal opinion but titans look awfull when they are female.
---
Helmet +3 only Drops if you the helmet Upgrade up to 3 from driftet bounties.  It wont drop in rekon
---
I‚Äôm using Sunshot because the catalyst drop recently. The second part of it sucks.
---
Needs that Benny Hill music
---
Unless you're low on cores, but yeah, I 'd just save them for later otherwise.
---
Go through the bus that is next to the building
---
You‚Äôre right though. If you don‚Äôt mind the draw speed, you can get a better subtle calamity. If you do, an Arsenic Bite can still 1-shot and can roll regular Archer‚Äôs Tempo, which doesn‚Äôt require hipfire, and basically matches the draw speed. Plus you can get rampage or explosive tips, I think even Dragonfly on either Arsenic or Subtle Calamity, putting them that much further above Hush.
---
and land arc super final blows on opposing guardians in the crucible or gambit
---
Isn‚Äôt that one on a floating island?
---
Is he really complaining about a chest in the EAZ? I somewhat understand crucible hate mail but wow lol.
---
I felt the same way, playing anything (mostly gambit) hoping it would drop as an engram. I got lucky maybe a month or two afterwards when one dropped by an envoy.
---
You‚Äôll get yours guardian, RNG bless you üëçüèΩ
---
I mean, how can you tell which one you get early in the match?
---
Only if you are already max level, just saying.
---
No idea then. Maybe a bug with the progress or typo in the description. Either way, that at least makes it easier.
---
I am pretty sure the exotics are a no, since right now people without DLC can't get exotics from a DLC they don't own, and that is how it has worked since launch. I am not sure about supers. I am inclined to guess no, but since Bungie has not said very much about Shadowkeep, I cannot 100% say for sure.
---
Yes.
---
can you elaborate
---
I totally agree. I love Antaeus, but since I get so many misadventures it does feel like they are one of the more "novelty" exotics. I, personally want to see Bungie fix this exotic because I do believe this can be one of those exotics that can have a really high skill cap and can be extremely OP on the feet of someone who has mastered them. I feel like Antaeus  would change the whole game if they were tweaked a little bit.
---
Bungie got themselves away from that business partnership.
---
As far as I know they have not said anything about the armor besides what is in that TWAB.
---
F
---
Wait that‚Äôs illegal.
---
r/PersonalAttacks
---
There‚Äôs no point the way they do it is that they set up a brand new account so they‚Äôre main account doesn‚Äôt get effected.
---
Kenan is a national treasure
---
Total noob at destiny speaking: How do you get this?
---
You're absolutely right! I've been luckily enough to start remembering maps and heavy locations. I tried doing rumble but my clan said there was nothing "Sweaties" in there. It took me a while to figure that one out. I used to DM on Halo all the time and always enjoyed it. I will definitely hop in there now that you've mentioned it. As far as my rolls, I'm gonna light a candle for the RNG gods and hope they smile in my favor, but I'm not holding my breath.
---
I've almost exclusively been playing quickplay and I can't tell you how many bullets I've eaten from Not Forgotten/Austringer/Beloved/Lord of Wolves/Luna's Howl/Recluse/etcetcetc.
---
To my understanding, those are some hard hitting guns you have to grind comp for and holy fuck, it seems like everyone has those fucking guns. 
---
Idk. I'm kinda glad that I'm not the only one bitching. Although it does make me question my skill/capabilities. I'd hate that the game would have to be patched for me to succeed. It sort of makes the whole "git good" thing hit a bit harder. Thanks for the comment buddy
---
I mean I guess, but at least it makes them go through the process of creating a whole new xbox live profile. Worth a couple button clicks to me, but you do you.
---
Wouldn't be surprised if xbox blocks the IP if it happens enough times, and then they gotta go through even more trouble to change their address and create a new account.
---
This would be sick as an actual .44 mag, or .45-70 gov't for the really ambitious.
---
Malfeasance kills them easily too. stack enough bullets then when they all detonate they'll shred him.
---
I do concede that playing against toxic people is not enjoyable, but that's not I got from sweaty, which would be meta loadout, excessively slippery movement, achieves low ttk, etc.
---
Plus, ending in 0.3 efficiency is just something that happens sometimes and it's inevitable. So when it happens to me I just relax cause I know what will happen if I start tilting.
---
I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôll be brutal. When D2 vanilla dropped it was a good bit. As it was fun chatting with your friends for awhile, we don‚Äôt have that kind of time anymore haha.
---
Back in D1, if a melee was capable of dissolving/incinerating/atomizing an enemy, then you could melee a cursed there's without them exploding.
---
We do need another exotic sidearm; we haven't gotten one since ratking back at launch
---
Thanks
---
now do a hunter and a titan....
---
ü§ôüèª I‚Äôll take a gander
---
that's the spirit!
---
I mainly use the Spiteful Fang (Forge bow) as it's everything I want in a bow. It's produces a nice subtle *fwoosh* when you shoot it as well as being able to get rolls for specific uses.
---
I prefer a lightweight frame bow as they provide more challenge at a distance and keep me focused.
---
Hush is actually fantastic even if you're not constantly proccing Archer's Gambit. It has the same feel of Le Monarque but without the poison DoT, draw time is identical meaning if you can get the hang of Le Monarque then you can use Hush normally no problem (without it's perk).
---
It's all about what works for you!
---
It‚Äôs better than revelry which is what I expected so I‚Äôm happy
---
Am expecting another Datto rant video about this
---
Any tips you can pass along?  üòÅ
---
I love sidearms, but I hate translation theory lol
---
I‚Äôm disappointed about the bright dust/engram stuff - the actual event is a f‚Äîk ton of grinding but I expected that.  I hoped it was less but what can ya do ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Oh no, you're totally right. I just thought that team-bagged thing was funny. It did actually happen though. Yeah, the sweaty dudes are totally top tier players or at least players that understand the mechanics of Crucible very well.
---
Those other dudes were just assholes. 
---
It's nice to see that other peeps are hitting those 0.3's, lol. I definitely breathe deep when I'm feeling like dead weight. Thanks for mentioning that, it makes the whole thing feel a lot more relatable.
---
Which step are you on?
---
Yes, Solstice of Heroes is a timed event. It lasts about a month at the end of the Destiny year. This current Solstice of Heroes event ends on August 27th. 
---
I haven't progressed Solstice enough to see for myself what it requires, but looks like it is all stuff that is doable for people who have completed the base game campaign but nothing much beyond that. You can only get the armor during the event. If you don't get it this event, you'd have to wait for next year's Solstice of Heroes with its own set of armor to come around.
---
It‚Äôs a song about the end of all things! Muwahaha
---
i'm really digging the solstice armors. can't wait to finish all 3 classes
---
If you would like to know more about it, you can type into google "destiny 2 zero hour" and you should find some videos showing what it is.
---
Some people accidentally do it, some people do it to troll their teammates...
---
I do it cuz no fucks given.
---
*Attempts Russian accent*
---
If I die, I die.
---
I‚Äôm down. Potato was fun
---
Hover over the armor piece and it should say objectives. Do those. If they are unclear, go to the armor details page and read what it says.
---
It will let you upgrade the pieces once all of them are complete
---
PEREGRINE GREAVES!!!!
---
Thank you! I felt so dumb i was like i have my helmet done! Lol
---
I expected something very different.
---
Thanks so much
---
It isnt

Sometimes i punch them just for the adrenaline shot

Your submission has been removed in violation of Rule 13 - No Loot/Roll posts.

Great work Guardian! However loot posts are prohibited to prevent our subreddit from being cluttered (we get way too many!) - please keep these submissions in the weekly pinned loot/achievement thread. Thanks!

If you've got a question concerning if a roll you've got is good or not, try /r/ShardItKeepIt !
---
After you grind gambit so much you don‚Äôt feel anymore you just keep telling yourself ‚Äúdoing it for the damn loot/achievement ‚Äú
---
*upgrades into another exotic handcannon*
---
Destiny app does
---
Helmets only drop from the weekly Reckoning bounties.  But u got to get Illicit and the outlawed versions before u get notorious. You can run it all at Tier 3.
---
Huzzah! A man of quality!
---
What's wrong with reckoning.
---
I haven't tried it due to a primal hate for sweaty gambit prime.
---
But how much time has to be spent in that 3 week span to obtain the max full set?
---
I am afforded very little time to play and feel like the limited time I do have is not at all rewarding, much like OP.
---
I love Destiny. I love the world and the lore, the gunplay and characters. I do not like feeling as if the few precious hours I have in a given week are wasted playing the game.
---
I always tell myself this after said deed, "You didn't kill me. I KILLED MYSELF."
---
You.... copied there tweet?
---
only if you want to masterwork the gloves.

Stonks
---
It pretty much is but there‚Äôs no real reason to fully upgrade it
---
Please no I can't grind anymore
---
My only tip would be to not get burned out on the game. Take some breaks; enjoy the game, just not too much. It‚Äôll get boring quick if you get to the endgame then do everything.
---
Cheersüëç
---
To be honest, I‚Äôd stopped gambit with season of opulence and only discovered last week how close I was to Dregen while unlocking bad juju and protect the runner and thrillemonger my clan fixed with me.
---
First
---
So you don‚Äôt need to masterwork every single armor to get the title??
---
Just putting it out there but you know cross saves is becoming a thing in Destiny?
---
Not a tip necessarily but more of a suggestion, you should 100% read the lore. Idk if you're into that kind of stuff but it's the most well written lore I've ever read in a game. It's incredible.
---
Also there are roombas in the arcology on titan
---
The top tier stuff has never been for casuals, the grind aspect is what separates them. I‚Äôm one complete reset and a bit away from my first title, fuck the casuals who complain it‚Äôs too hardüëç
---
The roombas are beautiful bro
---
I just did that today, lol, took over an hour due to those servitors, lol
---
Shell only comes from the drifter after 3 resets. It takes forever
---
I can not for the life of me learn a raid by watching YouTube videos, I usually learn as I go.
---
Post this on the lfg, not on the reddit. People are more likely to help you on LFG- Companion app. Plus, posts like these can really clog up the content on the subreddit. Thank you.
---
You forgot the 200 arc super kills
---
Yeah they‚Äôre pretty fun and simple and give some cool weapons. I‚Äôd just wish they stopped giving us activities to get strong gear and gave us stuff to actually use the strong gear on. Still makes me upset that they got rid of prestige raids cuz they were a good solution to that problem
---
Came back after not playing for almost a year, bought Forsaken, when I got the Dreaming City, almost *no-one* knew how to proc this, a Heroic YEAR ONE event, I was so confused. Didn't everyone who did this back when it was only on Io know exactly what to do?
---
Thanks man
---
See for me it‚Äôs also like taking a bath, except instead of water it‚Äôs fire and instead of soap you have hornets and instead of being in a bathtub you‚Äôre in hell
---
Maybe with all the attention it's getting they'll fix the bug where the Drifter says the envoys are dead BUT THEY'RE RIGHT OVER THERE
---
And the bank is always blocked at that point
---
You don't fear vanguard operations Guardian. But can you handle my vending machine?
---
I understand bro I was carrying in comp. we lost, but i was on top in everything (except revives) dude has the ego to send me hate mail like wtf you want from me.üò§
---
maybe if they had more than 3 people would like them
---
Stop posting here you actual child. You‚Äôre spamming the sub and nobody wants to see your temper tantrums. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a sub just for these kind of rant/whining posts, but this isn‚Äôt it. Go away.
---
I play gambit all the time, don't think this will feel like a chore for me. its enjoyable
---
mind you, the actual organic Vex in the stomach container probably have heads of some description, and I'm sure a bullet ripping through there is vaporizing a lot of vex heads.
---
so in a way...
---
You sir....have my upvote!
---
Take advantage of your dodge for both mobility purposes and for functionality ie reload or melee regen, personally I prefer reload in the heat of a fight, and personally id use triple jump to give you more unpredictability in the air. That being said I use handcannon sniper because it‚Äôs best in air compaired to other weapons, and a snipe followed by a dodge to cover can save your life, plus snipers are effective
---
Probably.
---
I hope i come up against you then. I need the wins for Fabled!!!
---
Don't care.
---
because she likely does. most of the instagram girls focus on stomach, butt &amp; thighs so that way they can take side-on photos where they look skinny and have their butt stick out with thighs that could kill a man.
---
gotta cover a wide variety of followers.
---
It's called Raiden Flux. Mystery solved.
---
Play rumble. No teammates, no problem. I only play rumble in cricible
---
Imagine pre-nerfed combat flow multiplier still being in the game
---
never had no much fun
---
Oh right ! Imma check bout my other chars today. Hodpe i'll get em soon
---
Play with friends then problem solved, just because low levels are coming into your quickplay games and "ruining" them because they haven't learnt the meta yet doesn't mean you have to be angry about it. Instead play comp it at least has some form of matchmaking and still earns you valor
---
This isn't an LFG sub.

Rule 10.

While you‚Äôre fighting a large blocker. 
---
Dammit.
---
Why would he even want every weapon to be as good as every other one? Sounds pretty dull to me - so long as people can access at least some of the stuff that is currently top tier, then an evolving meta is fun.
---
That was my point. While they aren‚Äôt ‚Äúoverweight‚Äù, they don‚Äôt always take exercises in the best way possible. Though, I suppose it‚Äôs all in preference.
---
Look at his post history. There‚Äôs a reason he can‚Äôt find a group.
---
this is why the cabal invaded
---
God this is so real
---
If you are on ps4 you can force the game into solo mode by messing with the clock in the ps4 settings.
---
Yea lol, in the third round it‚Äôs kinda like mayhem and so with shards, hunters can get their blade barrage back nearly instantly.
---
I used truth, don‚Äôt even think had hand cannon equipped, as long as you kill invader within 10 seconds and before they kill any of your team mates
---
Whats the max any of you guys have destroyed in a match? Because I'm curious if you can get anythung special for all of them and just in curious how many there are in total
---
But it‚Äôs also good for stunning bosses
---
Ok thanks much appreciated
---
The weird thing is how it works for F2P games like warframe and fortnite for example. You don't need PS plus to play them. The same is for games that require a subscription like FFXIV. 
---
With destiny free light being a F2P game it would make sense for it to follow suit but Bungie hasn't elaborated on this.
---
Your comment made me wet myself a little. thanks for the laugh.
---
Neat Super Transitions, but there's a lot of scenes I feel have nothing going on for them *other than* to set up the transition, which isnt what a transition should be used for.
---
Like the Volundr forge To Menagerie Gauntlet Ward Of Dawn one, fir example. I replayed it about 4 times trying to understand what was interesting about the forge shot, abd determined there wasnt anything noteworthy about it. Threw me off.
---
Otherwise, 5/10 decent clip montage of "I was holding Mountaintop" and other Architectural Gameplay. 
---
One drawback of Super-Transitions that you've made here is when the Super is fired, that's when things get *interesting* usually, but in order for them to *work* you'll need a cool preceding shot to *end* on a Super firing, instead of shoehorning in other shots just to pull them off.
---
Good luck with your endeavours, Guardian.
---
I used a Nova bomb.
---
This year, you can only purchase them at eververse. 5000 bright dust, or 800 Silver.  Basically forcing us to pay them $13 (CAD) if we want something we got for free last year.
---
Easy protect the runner or whatever it is though lol, that‚Äôs all I need for dredgen
---
I don‚Äôt get to play destiny a lot how long is the event going to last?
---
cry
---
I always look for the nearest corner with a long sight line for the sniper shot and pray that I hit it when they come for me üòÇ
---
I'm yeeting people with the yeet toaster
---
As the wise Shaxx says "Tell your enemies to line up faster"
---
I couldn't bother doing the "Crucible" milestone, the part where you had to play 2 Comp matches
---
haaaa, he sounds like he got his just desserts
---
They‚Äôre hoping everyone will spend their silver and bright dust now so they buy more for shadowkeep
---
I‚Äôve just barely played any gambit since I got dredgen back in season 5
---
mind if I steal this but make it a nova bomb.
---
Foetracer or Oathkeeper, Enhanced Bow perks, and a trusty shotgun/SMG for rushers.
---
and it worked, just spent 2500 bright dust on the mini sparrow.... I couldn't help myself it was calling to me
---
literally i just had this much bright dust lying around
---
So how high of a light level will I get if I bring it all out? 750 or the cap for whatever it was before Forsaken?
---
Run the European aerial zone once then return to Eva
---
The only pool it is removed from is xur's fated pool.
---
Complete the mission in the EAZ and then when you return to Eva, she gives you the entire set
---
It‚Äôs designed to last till August 27th.
---
Still, I appreciate you not giving in to the fomo.
---
keep doing the quests she gives you, think its complete a run of the EAZ and a bounty but dont hold me to that i forget things real easy
---
It could be masked by the building being white. And the symbol being white. Checking for red on radar. We got red,  I‚Äôm going to drive my sparrow right through that sucker! ‚ÄúWell that was a terrible idea!‚Äù
---
You can read them online if you don't want to wait. I find Banshee-44's dialogue lines most interesting somehow.
---
What did it cost?
---
sadly, static roll weapons remain in the pool even after you get them
---
Yep, long time ago  welcome to the club.
---
its retroactive, i reset valor during the last IB and haven't done so again since. boots came with that step already completed
---
Find yourself a farming Fireteam via the app. That's what I've started doing. Just load in, teamkill all the bosses and then leave and repeat.
---
But also if you have a team who knows about it and you get the Cabal encounter with three bosses in the end, you can farm that one until finished. See, because if you kill 2of the 3 and leave him alone every 30 seconds or so a yellow bar Psion will come down from a drop ship and spawn some scorpion turrets. Kill the Psion and it'll just keep respawning and each one counts towards your total. 
---
An announcement will come on screen saying something along the lines of "A Psion Engineer has arrived to assist the Cabal!" And then a drop ship swoops down and drops it off.
---
I did this for about a half an hour and got about 50 done.
---
Its specifically void grenades. Doesnt matter what the burn is
---
Everything
---
I actually some how loaded two rockets into a bad omens and can‚Äôt replicate it so
---
Same, I still have 110 after master working all my IB gear
---
I think outlaw would be better suited instead of the direct round reload.  And unlike memento mori.  The chambered round wouldn't dissapear if you swapped weapons.
---
&lt; spending 4 million dust on tributes to get a catalyst for a weapon just to extend the buff duration by 2 seconds
---
precision shot
---
Do you have to buy the glow shaders or are they just a rare drop
---
Is there any reason to masterwork more than one piece? I mean with the new set coming with shadowkeep.
---
Someone in my clan said thats not the case this time.
---
Those requirements are just to masterwork the armor. If you are only interested in having armour that's 2.0 ready when shadowkeep launches then all you need is the legendary armor :)
---
it‚Äôs literally the only titan exotic i don‚Äôt have, and im feeling like ive lost a life long friend
---
i just wanna keep people into orbit honestly
---
oem is just an annoying exotic, i don‚Äôt use it bc i have dignity and won‚Äôt punish ppl by pressing m1 on me
---
I started out in titan. Did the 25 patrols and got the hive kills and heroic events done at the same time. Then i did the 10 gambit matches which i just played 10 gambit prime's and after doing those few things i managed to get the elemental orbs half complete. Fire weapon kills on guardians count if your team kills them and i think the 200 super arc final blows count for the whole team too though I'm not sure. I finished off with some bounties, did 7 of spider's, the three on mars, three on edz and three on io. Took about 40 mins and managed to do 16 of them. 
---
I managed to do finish the chest piece before i went off yesterday but now I'm about to get on and do another. The grind is real but you can absolutely do it. We're all in the same boat and we have a month to complete it, don't give up. It will be worth it in the end.
---
I‚Äôd rather have it back me out and matchmake again to find a new team.  There‚Äôs been way too many times when i finish one round of reckoning and 2 people leave and I‚Äôm waiting 10 minutes for another full team
---
&gt; Same thing with when crucible is required.
---
*cries in mountaintop quest*
---
The default ones, yours are neato
---
Pretty sure that housed a T Virus motherfucker
---
Maybe he's actually blind, because he seems to have that glazed eyeball look or he's high?
---
On the other side of that is a hole in the ground straight to the Cavern of Souls.
---
I think u mean hunters in the EAZ
---
smart enough to not have fun?
---
that sounds boring
---
Eh. not sure. the thing is. that stuff shouldnt be hard. especially if you have a well and still screw it up somehow. somewhat of a red flag.
---
if you succeed with a random team on the other hand its not unlikely that you do multiple runs in succession.
---
What's the one eyed mask do?
---
I like it, it's fun to play and see your friends losing motes lol
---
I‚Äôm right there with you
---
Its quite funny, these ppl doing nothing but this repetitive bullshit for hours upon hours for absolutely nothing. There's literally a month to complete it. " I GOT TO COMPLETE IT RIGHT NOW AND COMPLAIN ABOUT HOW MUCH SHIT HAS TO BE DONE...AAARRRGGGHHH!"
---
Thanks and at this point i just want a spare rations I don‚Äôt care if it sucks
---
Was it worth it?
---
When do we get these packages
---
What makes it not worth it
---
Yeah exactly. I hardly ever die to OEM, and if I do it's because the guy outplayed me, the "overshield" didnt really have anything to do with it.
---
But it's so damn unjustifiably cute!
---
I tried the wanted targets and that doesn't count. 
---
* I was rolling around the Rupture on IO, No. 
---
* Went to Trostland waited for the Purple Servitor, Nothing.
---
* Winding Cove for that Bumblebee looking Cabal guy, Nada
---
* That ugly looking Knight of Titan, Nope
---
Bruh, that guy with 1.2k downvotes for saying it didn't belong on the other sub.
---
Nope no fated engrams. Make sure you do the treasure maps from Werner though, seemingly have a super high chance for exotics. Get like one a week from them
---
oof, those legendary shards
---
oh dude that‚Äôs big brain, i stopped doing them due to my chalice being perfected but thank u so much.... i May be able to knee hopefully
---
Now take a screenshot with an Arc subclass equipped and it should glow even brighter!
---
Good luck!
---
i lov u
---
well i less than three you too (&lt;3)
---
I tried using erenthil for the void kills but i keep getting jotunned, lord of wolves or some other crap.
---
I hate myself..
---
It‚Äôs not a ridiculous quest, it‚Äôs moments of triumph, it‚Äôs gonna make you go through the whole game. It‚Äôs not moments of ‚Äúpve‚Äù it‚Äôs gonna encompass the whole game. Now I hate the Gambit step just as much as the next guy, but I‚Äôm not gonna screw over my teammates just because I don‚Äôt like gambit.
---
I disagree, it's not like there isn't way more PvE content. In fact it's mostly PvE. A good 75 - 80 percent of it is. But not when it comes to exotic or pinnacle quests. There's almost always a PvP portion, why would it be an issue to have the option of both PvE and PvP? I'd even like it if the PvE side was harder or more time consuming.
---
I simply dislike PvP, that's not a crime.
---
Oem is a joke just like bungies pvp team.. it needs a total rework but again too many egos at bungie
---
Not really but ok
---
Gives HOTline Bling an different meaning i guess
---
I do it on my ps4 you afk the forges. you get your light to below 500 and go to the forge and just walk away from your controller. you also dont have to worry about effecting other guardians cause the guardians you will be matched with are others who are afk farming. here the vid link for context

#LOST SECTOR INTENSIFIES

I'm just wondering how they work with Sentinel. You're not even hitting the enemy with the shin blades, why does it do more damage?
---
He took a break after giving me that damn strike five times yesterday.
---
The set from the dreaming city is pretty cool, minus the helm 
---
It looks kinda knight ish which is neat and looks dope with the pure white Trials shader, if you've got that
---
XD
---
I enjoy Gambit but it's still quite heavily PvP, invasions are critical in that mode. I wish there was an option for just PvE Gambit. I know I'd not be the only one that would enjoy that.
---
Clearly a Knight and some Cursed Thrall. Or Exploding Shanks and a Captain. I could see a couple of Gladiators busting out of there.
---
Titan is also a likely spot seeing they‚Äôre littered with shipping containers. But my money would be on EDZ
---
Every person I inspect who has masterworked armor has mountaintop, recluse and swarm of the raven.  It just adds more salt onto my wounds.
---
I tried using Oxygen SR3 among others and this is the only rifle that consistently hits targets in the head. PvE and PvP.
---
I love gambit! It‚Äôs the crucible I can‚Äôt stand. That‚Äôs just because I‚Äôm terrible at it though
---
Easy 3 tap map from across most maps if you can get them out of cover. And sometimes to can get collateral kills if other Guardians take damage from Dragonfly while getting hit by adds.
---
I dont hide behind a wall right after I shoot at someone, so no, the wall hacks didnt do much for him in my opinion. If I'm playing better than someone it doesn't matter if they have a marker on me or just know that I'm behind a wall, I'll win the gunfight, and vice versa. I dont think a perk that says "hey he's behind that wall, or maybe the wall behind that, idk" is broken
---
Seems like it. but luckily we have 2 iron banners before shadowkeep.
---
Post pics please. Pwease? uwu
---
Would equipping a ghost shell with guiding light (all xp gains increased 10%) help farm best of year one engrams?
---
For Gambit Prime  you can shatter all the Primeval shields with equal efficiency. It's my swiss army fusion long rifle
---
no and your a dick
---
Thank you so much to all of you willing to help but I am on NA servers only!
---
lemon is great if you pair it with oathkeepers. bit of a meme build but it works
---
thx
---
When a random Vandal kills you from off-screen and starts waving his hands in the air like he won the lottery
---
Like...mini boss kills? Are you playing solo? with our team we found it easier to split up a bit, we always get at least 10 a run.
---
*Bring a sword!*
---
Be a real titan and use worm god bottom tree striker!
---
Makes me wonder to what end? If they have no intention of playing the game then why are they *playing the game?*
---
That's not a bug.
---
If you are playing against a sub par player who is using oem then no wallhacks are not going to help them that much. If you are playing against someone of similar skill it‚Äôs literally broken. It just becomes: get shot, go behind cover and heal, peak again or just track them through the wall as they push you. 
---
In any other game wallhacks are considered cheating.
---
I get it destiny is waaay different than other FPSs but wallhacks are wallhacks and there isn‚Äôt much else too it.
---
Sick I would be totally down to do that, even tho I might not know howüòÇ If you don‚Äôt already have a clan I‚Äôm thinking about joining ‚ÄúPawned Gjallahorn‚Äù I found on r/fireteams
---
I have both so I might give it a try
---
You do though
---
So is the hunter inherent ability broken as well? Or somehow not broken because it requires 1 kill? Because if we are talking about a mediocre player it's not that difficult to get 1 kill and then you get to see the full outline of everyone on the map and be invisible. Based on the same grounds, that's even more broken imo
---
I have a 1TB SSD and it‚Äôs still as slow as this
---
doesn't work, typo on the class items, challenging enemies means boss kills, anything that drops 10 radiant seeds for black armory frames. leviathan mobs, regular yellow and orange bars, they don't count unless there's a raid symbol next to the name
---
I've been scouring the internet for one since the event dropped on Tuesday. I haven't found one yet but have been trying to mentally note the layout and named areas of the map while hunting down the chests at the end of each encounter. This is what I have so far started from spawn:
---
Garage: Immediately right
---
Ruin: Mid Right
---
Town: Immediately Left
---
Mall: Mid Right
---
Factory: Straight Ahead
---
Warehouse: Back Right? (This one I'm sketchy on, if someone can corroborate.)
---
Courtyard: Is in the middle directly in front of spawn
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Again, I'm still piecing together a mental map myself but this what I have so far.
---
Yes I agree, flawless execution is also busted.
---
Ohhhh yikes
---
Patience

*Shadowkeep has been delayed to October 1.*
---
*Bungie have provided more information regarding this change here:* [*bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48032*](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48032)
---
Is this true?
---
Presumably to move it out of the Borderlands release window. 
---
No matter how good a DLC is it‚Äôll never compete with a new game, let alone if so hotly anticipated.
---
Hehe but no. You need to buy all ornaments for all characters separately.
---
for PvP Anything that increases range
---
For PvE Outlaw Rampage
---
More like : A.Super spam B.Super spam C.Super spam D.Super spam.
---
Sort of, I have a warlock who‚Äôs at about 650 light and a titan at level 30, I‚Äôm not a fan of playing either of those classes though, and triple grind is not for me
---
Thank you. That makes sense and I‚Äôm glad that now I know I definitely won‚Äôt have enough bright dust to unlock all glows for all characters. I will just focus on all 3 for my Warlock only. Although the Hunter glows looks pretty sharp too.
---
Borderlands 3, it releases 5 days before Shadowkeep was supposed to be released.
---
If you do not own Forsaken, you can only get up to level 30 and power level 380. 
---
The power level of the solstice armor is based on the level you are, that is why it's level 30. It will increase in power level as you upgrade it, but I don't know how high it will go. The point of the armor is to do the objectives on it, which improves it from green rarity to blue rarity up to purple (legendary) rarity. Solstice of Heroes is a holiday event all about upgrading this armor set to legendary. This means if you don't get the legendary armor set by August 27, you lose the opportunity since the holiday event will have ended. It will go back to being normal armor stuck in whatever state you had it in.
---
[See this news post for more info.](https://www.bungie.net/en-US/Explore/Detail/News/48006)
---
So does this mean the switch over to steam will also be delayed? And what about cross save? Because I‚Äôve been waiting to buy the game on PC just for that reason idk if I can wait longer!!
---
I see me vs the guy with no job.
---
No..?
---
What if it‚Äôs bad even with the delay
---
Not really, considering you keep all your pinnacle weapons so if you have a recluse you still a demon
---
Damn, that reeeeeaaaaaallllly blows. I should've just started the quest without the emote.
---
Might need to reinstall the blizzard app and do an integrity check on your game files?
---
I‚Äôve run it for 9hrs no issues on multiple occasions
---
Now take your fuckin tangled web helm and get the hell out of here
---
It's been patched. Anyone that exploited the game to obtain any items early have had the items rightfully removed and locked until the actual required objective is completed legitimately
---
no problem dude good luck with the grind!
---
That's fucking bogus.
---
What do you mean 'in your profile'?
---
You cant find this info in orbit. You have to be at a destination
---
Obviously.
---
Im not sure if i want to. I feel like this is just something to fill time until shadowkeep which at that point new armor will come out that looks better and also has the 2.0 options.
---
I mean come on,  queens breaker, sleeper, or thunderlord meta sucked,  but at least you had to try to aim.  The Truth is significantly more easy and more op.
---
Not if you have a shell with Nessus or EDZ Scanner perks, it‚Äôs RNG but you‚Äôll sometimes get an extra one or two shards or datalatices and over 8hrs it makes a big difference üëç
---
Yes just not for the orbs but running riskrunner i got the orbs in 2 or 3 matches

LOVE ‚ù§Ô∏è MY SCOOTY PUFF JR!!!!
---
hey now, I love my tangled web helm with heavy ammo finder and kinetic weapon loader.
---
Is it for sale for dust right now
---
I am fine with the delay, but two weeks in a development cycle seems rather tiny. What can you really do in 2 weeks.
---
No what‚Äôs bogus is you exploited your way you to things.  Now you have to do it the right way.  I applaud Bungie for this.
---
It's absolutely incredible
---
That me
---
Only if you cheated! The rest of us who burned through literally all their mats and shards may not be very sympathetic üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
I‚Äôd main warlock if this existed
---
I really like Halfdan-D.
---
That‚Äôs me
---
The delux edition comes with forsaken
---
That's me on the sparrow!
---
I can hear the slaps a universe away.
---
I know exactly what to do... But on Xbox 1x
---
 Sorry bro get a better consol
---
I'm sorry your care that much about a fucking video game. I have a life and can't spend 30 hours grinding for one stupid gun.
---
You looked very majestic that I had to take a screenshot.
---
Collections.
---
Apparently I'm the only one who thinks that the Warlock set is ugly as fxck. But hey, glad y'all like it.
---
Yeah I went there but I can‚Äôt seem to find it, am I just blind?

No kidding.

It‚Äôs gonna be in the spooky month so it will be extra haunted
---
From their official steam post regarding the delay  [https://steamcommunity.com/games/1085660/announcements/detail/1601511973015751619](https://steamcommunity.com/games/1085660/announcements/detail/1601511973015751619):
---
&gt;If you are already a player of Destiny 2 on PC, we‚Äôll have more details to share next week for how you‚Äôll be able to move all of your existing Guardians to Steam.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Stay tuned!
---
So we'll finally have some info on this next week.
---
3000 Dust or 500 Silver if i read correct on reddit
---
this right here. it wasn't as broken as spectral either
---
I got one but I don't have the emblem, do I have to use it or something bc it's not in my inventory?
---
Every emblem you have shows up under the collections tab in the flair section. I suppose it's possible this one emblem is the exception, but I doubt that. It is probably buried among a mountain of other emblems in one of the pages.
---
They obviously didn't include EVERYthing. You'll have to wait and see like the rest of us.
---
Thought the exact same thing OP! Good to know we atleast have something to keep us occupied until shadowkeep
---
Thats a sub 5 minute strike done right. People wanna go fast.
---
How is this any different? You die if they catch you in the open, just more people have this one because it‚Äôs a short and easy quest
---
My guess would be character or events
---
is it only me or have you guys also the problem that it only appears on one char??
---
I'm beyond hyped for Shadowkeep but I've been waiting for Borderlands 3 for so long too
---
Im going to try this with my dawnblade where you can drop down hella fast
---
its called a speed run, if you have multiple strikes to do its the quickest way.
---
It's like 4 hours ago, the WANTED enemy is escaping!
---
I thought that BL3 was coming out on [respectable gaming platform] in like 6 months. Did you get it early access? Surely you didn‚Äôt give Epic money... surely you didn‚Äôt...
---
Given the dark entrance, im saying hive
---
I see this as an absolute win
---
It‚Äôs because you relogged m8
---
Oooh that looks real slick
---
Backup plan is good but auto-loading holster is meh. Try to go for a roll with opening shot since it‚Äôs the only fusion that can roll with it.
---
also helps destiny devs to not get overworked
---
I have a group on xbox but we're... Shitty people sometimes lmao
---
"The last tip"
---
;)
---
/r/wooosh ;-)
---
So it isn‚Äôt finished? Doesn‚Äôt mean just because the map is small that it isn‚Äôt recycled content. If they were going to make a battle royale they would need an area with a lot of verticality similar to how this area is designed.
---
Where is the random Cabal Centurion? üòÄ
---
Yha bungie, but tiny sparrow
---
For generations, the dreaming city housed one of the awokens most closely guarded secrets. She is known as riven, riven of a thousand voices, the last known ahamkara. She has been taken, and her death is your calling.
---
As usual, the warlock armor looks real dumb. 
---
*sigh*
---
Well done
---
Great now, thanks for the tips
---
&gt;*Come on and slam, and welcome to the Jam!*
---
I'm a hunter but still plenty guilty of doing this way too often! It's like I see that damn glowing head and have to punch it! Glad I'm not the only oneüòÅ
---
100 isn‚Äôt that many, especially when your team is getting 10-15 per run, not to mention you have other EAZ bounties and will be getting it passively.
---
i NE'd
---
He means that soon you will be able to change the perks. Look up armor 2.0.
---
I‚Äôm so stoked I switched to Titan main. I‚Äôm so ready to be a fucking astronaut man! Hunter looks cool too. I feel like the Warlock would be better if they just took off that weird looking mask from the helmet.
---
Imagine the power of A single ghost shell capable of crashing every single guardian in the tower in an instant.
---
You will be able to change the perks with armor 2.0.
---
If I Own Everything But Shadowkeep and I Want to Transfer to PC From Xbox, Will I Only Have To Rebuy Forsaken And Y2 AP?
---
not to mention everyone leaving after the "miniboss phase" and just skipping the chests since you require double the amount of bosses killed vs chests found.
---
Yes because not supporting shitty business practice makes you childish.
---
If So, should I Buy Forsaken and Y2 AP On B.net now or wait until Shadowkeep's Launch?
---
Exactly! Those 3
---
They‚Äôre fully embracing the RPG elements, you can build a build to fit your play style and match it with armor mods, haven‚Äôt seen much but looks very promising. I would watch the most recent ViDoc if I were you
---
How long can you get this sparrow? My Xbox is out of commission but I don't want to miss out
---
I think u missed the part where I was saying I do this solo.  10 to 15? You‚Äôre kidding right? Im lucky if I get 4!
---
Exactly, it‚Äôs such a mess
---
Bungie-works tirelessly on entire solstice event 
---
Us- OwO tiny sparrow!
---
Mine was, they‚Äôre like letters so they‚Äôre in a separate slot of the postmaster
---
How do I get it!!??!????
---
Welp I just took the plunge. Thanks!
---
I lol'd so hard when I first saw some random guardian driving one of these. I just had to get it, I haven't done a single thing for the solstice event except just get the first armor piece from the tower. I dont give a shit about grinding out all the other pieces, I'm just happy I've got the mini-birb.
---
Ok?
---
Right. Error code: Fabulous
---
[reference](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/502/961/354.png) to shadowkeep

cocking a gun means readying it for action

detergent is what you use to wash laundry

you know it kinda ruins the joke when you have to explain it buddy

Nice
