It’ll come back for some promoting event, or possibly random drop from nostalgic engrams

---
Its definitely not hard to deal with if you know what you're doing
---
This is Reddit. And these are gamers. You're talking about the worst people in society, my dude.
---
There's not 4 subclasses its just the bottom one is the legs of the the person doing fists of havoc.
---
I play games on mute when watching sports alot. But then I do single player stuff. Not online play
---
Welp you can get to [the End of the Strike](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1908874044) thats at that location.
---
this is another reason why i personally think everyone should be automatically opted into team chat when playing TEAM gamemodes
---

---
gambit
---
gambit prime
---
freelance comp/all pvp
---
how the fuck can i callout if nobody is listening because chats are by default set to manually opt in and half of players dont know how to opt in, or change the setting, i play a ton of gambit and can call invaders as they spawn, but it doesnt help when nobody listens and i watch my teammates hording thier 15 motes and running to hide in spawn (which btw doesnt help, it turns it into a shooting gallery :) )
---
team chat is used for more than just being salty to your team, (:
---
Just did that today, worked fine for me. Did you restart the game?
---
tell me how to avoid the recluse. tell me the magic trick every top tier player has been missing that you’ve managed to figure out to avoid the most broken weapon in this sandbox.
---
It’s probably because he just enjoys the super, but there is a bug that causes Nova Warp to do ~6x the damage it’s supposed to.
---
Okay, but that range is MUCH different than 3.0+ range.  1.1-1.5 means you're playing about even with competition and, yes, you should remember to work objective and play smarter.  If you are in a match and getting 3.0+ then you do actually serve your time better and help your team more simply by continuing to kill as many opponents as possible and trust teammates doing less work to cap zones.
---
Oh TIL
---
You sound like the guy I kept shoulder charging last night. He was a little bitch too.
---
They legit broke this exotic.  You can still use Phoenix protocol and be fine but the skull.... it’s just GONE. Let the warlock people have their chance to play with different exotics and subs other than WOR and lunafaction boots. 
---
I am actually quite surprise they didn’t nerf nazarec’s as well. It’s pretty good right now with recluse and the artifact mods. 
---
Let’s see how long this goes.
---
im about to do that, I hope that fixes the issue
---
Xur has changed his mind
---
Yep ^
---
This would be a losing prop for Bungie. 80% of the players wouldn't bother with it, and 10% of the players would be getting an amazing deal because they'd normally spend way more than $25 on EV during the season. That leaves 10% of players that would actually pay more than they'd otherwise have spent at EV and that's not going to make the cut.
---
Just giving myself 1337 karma with this comment. Nothing to see here.
---
Recluse is only good at medium to long range. Either A, keep your distance or B) use a shotgun to rush out. Additionally, the only way a recluse really gets good, is when flanking. If you can avoid being flanked or anticipate it well enough, you can win in a fight. I'm telling you it's not a over the top weapon.
---
They game will always put anything else in the scoreboard instead of most melee kills ;-;
---
Oh believe me we tried
---
How can you hate the exos they are the coolest race in destiny
---
That's a very good point because I heard its useful for shotgun slides but I'm not a shotgun slider in pvp. But that reload and speed would definitely come in handy during nightfalls
---
Something did happen: Savathun broke the fourth wall to laugh at us for falling for her obvious trap.
---
That’s where you go for the Strike in shadow keep
---
&gt; The series focuses on [Charlie](https://hazbinhotel.fandom.com/wiki/Charlie), the princess of Hell, and her quest to open a hotel for rehabilitating demons. Hell suffers from overpopulation and Heaven solves the problem by routinely exterminating demons yearly. Charlie, who has grown up in Hell, wants to find an alternate solution to the mass slaughter. She opens the [Happy Hotel](https://hazbinhotel.fandom.com/wiki/Happy_Hotel) which aims at teaching demons and sinners to become better people. There is substantial resistance though, and Charlie and her friends must work together to keep the hotel running.

This sounds *amazing.* Is it streaming anywhere?
---
Nope, none are bugged. Finished all of mine the other day - - nothing misbehaved.
---
To joke in such situations is gloating. When the time can be better spent it is complacency or arrogance. It's fine. Some people are comfortable displaying that behavior. I'm not.
---
Oh yeah when I’m the last alive in a nightfall I slide around with them a lot it has saved my ass so much

Im assuming this is on pc

"Ha, you're crushing them! Send them home crying."
---
I read to do 10 in a week and you'll get one
---
Oh lawd
---
Ahh makes sense. Yeah now the gun has a dedicated quest, and at the end of the quest when you pick up the gun you get to go into this room and test it out on a huge group of Fallen when you clear them all the catalyst drops.
---
Pay more attention to this shit, i hope this was a joke. He absolutely did not kill himself, and it's serious.

Xur should not be selling quest exotics... I think that's a bug, it should be cerberus.
---
D2 is majorly effed up this week, my IB matches and bounties aren’t even working.
---
I won’t buy games any other way. Been that way for many years now. I don’t want that to be the case but companies releasing unfinished games for full price should NOT be okay and leave me no other choice.
---
Nice stick figure action
---
Awesome thanks for the heads up stoked to hopefully get thorn in a couple of days, on the void guardian kills step which is coming on quick with LM. Definitely going to give beloved a go as well haven't done menagerie for a while so will enjoy that. Nice tips much appreciated!
---
Nice
---
Forgot the o in the title. Noice.
---
No problem chief!
---
I mean... if you can’t OEM-ape, why not just punch everything to death?
---
By masterworked chalice you mean all 9 perks to? Everyone say masterworked chalice but I don’t know how to masterwork the chalice
---
Guess im just trash huh
---
I punch.
---
Were you also yelling at the player in the mic? If someone was yelling at me in the mic I wouldn’t do what they asked me to do.

---
Go into momentum control and get steaks and multikills with scout rifles. Multikills grant lost efficient progress
---
2 fusion rifle kills in one life.
---
From what I’ve heard, using a fusion in the momentum playlist for double kills is a good way. Momentum in general is great for that quest
---
Well, if that's the case then the Pyramid could create nightmare of literally any Guardian in existence. I suppose the idea of 'death' is a little screwy in the Destiny universe, though; a lot of things can be killed and die but won't necessarily stay that way. Guardians ourselves, or a lot of Hive magic nonsense like Xol and Oryx, though having been killed by us, continue to exist as weapons (Whisper of the Worm and Touch of Malice respectively)
---
So if the only criteria is that the subject needs to have "died", nightmares could exist of literally any Guardian ever just to start.
---
If it wasn’t done on purpose...
---
Literally EA
---
Wow I did not know there was that much lore. Is there an official book or something that contains that all?
---
BANK THOSE MOTES BROTHER

I mean, he yells the instructions constantly.
---
I’d be mad
---
There's no public voice chat on d2 for Xbox.
---
It's goldtusk. And we only went to wave 4 since I need a powerful without getting my pinn
---
Really needed those nade kills huh!
---
I did use recluse when I first got it but now I will not use it unless unless the other team are all meta using garbage.
---
I have this. It's bugged. I don't think there's a way for players to get rid of it.
---
This is about pre momentum control times. Tou may have that now, but when I was grinding I wasn't so lucky kills in survival count as 3x more.
---
Let's hope so...or I'm fucked XD If I just held onto the bounty I would have been golden. I probably would still have 2 or so days left to turn it in...
---
As someone that loves sniping, if you try to work it into every map you really start to see how much the maps are designed to force you in close, save for a few.
---
You are very welcome, after stumbling across this it has been of great use when fighting hunters LOL
---
Where does it show my glory rank? I see valor rank in top left corner when I click any crucible event, but i don't see where I can see what Glory Rank I am.
---
That’s no Hunter, just a cosplaying Warlock
---
Same issue. I just completed all of the vanguard bounties and turned them in while in the strike. No progress. What do you mean by additional?
---
the pause after he runs into the portal is cinematic
---
Yeah it’s pretty good
---
Might go home and do this.
---
If hes in the mission, i dont think it will let you join
---
Not as good as it once was in some places due to the auto-reload change in SK but still very nice for taking on Majors and doing some ad clearing simultaneously.
---
🏅
---
I dont have any coins
---
Loaded question is one of the best fusion rifles for pve content. It is definitely worth doing.
---
You meant 3 per week.
---
It do be like that
---
It really do dont it
---
The ban is from disconnects, if it was a ban for ddos it would be a game ban
---
Ya but you don’t always get armor. It will make farming for certain pieces easier
---
It do indeed it really do
---
Zavala approves of this comment indeed
---
I disagree.  For some of us that actually enjoy crucible,  games played would be incredibly boring.   The bounties and challenges as they are aren't hard at all for us.   It'd be like me saying take away flawless raids for emblems because I'll never get that. 
---
Instead I'm okay that there are some niches that aren't for me,  and vice versa.
---
Use the lfg app
---
This is my favorite yet.
---
They just stack in my postal

Thank you kind stranger

Mm. Still doesn’t look like it could kill someone in one hit.
---
Coat.
---
Mary Poppins y'all.
---
You can actually pull all the IPs in the lobby, even if they dont message or party up with you, its just easier doing that so you'll know exactly whose IP is whose, but if you play in a full squad that knows youre ddosing, you can just ask them for their IP and ddos the ones that arent theirs or yours
---
/s is sarcasm
---
I saw this exact post except they matched the font and made it look real and it got downvoted to 0. I'll never understand this sub
---
Yep. With perfect efficiency, you can get the sentient arc soul for 62 seconds, which for discipline higher than 30 (I think) is enough to be able to cast it immediately afterwards for another 20 seconds. 
---
It’s ridiculous and not really that great but I love my little buddy arc soul.
---
90 rpm god roll tranquility plus any spike 150 nade launcher is the best
---
I’m thinking about doing a d1 throwback stream of all the original raids, so I’ll message you if I do it!
---
Would be actually insane. Apparently Ikora has them, but they’re under lock and key. They most likely fuck with Guardians brains quite a bit.
---
No you’ll have to download all the content.

Play 1 extra game

Gamer dad? Need a group of people who are also gaming parents who get it when things gotta be dropped cause kiddo woke up? Look no further then [Dads of Destiny](https://www.bungie.net/en/Groups/Forum?groupId=112045&amp;pNumber=&amp;tSort=&amp;tType=)! We have clans spread out through all systems so everyone can find a clan to join or even start your own!
---
It could but it makes you better in the long run.
---
I really hate how the rewards are locked behind a quest. I was forced to run Jotunn which feels cheap but I want my armor dammit.
---
We need to get someone from bungie to make this

I thought swashbuckler was actually good? But then again, I don't know what master of arms does

Then i will

The guy you have to kill is in the back corner. Kill him and then the knights will spawn after. I just did it today.
---
We pretty much directly denied that path in lore, though. The Hive are furious and confused that we did not Take up the position of Taken King when we took Oryx down, as he did when he took down Akka.
---
Can I eat those?
---
That 888 is about to have a real bad time.
---
Look at 'em run!
---
I like swashbuckler, but master of arms is just better. I have a subjunctive that's similar to what recluse has, Outlaw and swashbuckler, instead of feeding frenzy  and master of arms.
---
To the the tower and meet all the NPCs. Then head to the Hanger and get the Red War campaign from Amanda. The three campaigns she offers are essentially the original Destiny 2 campaign and storylines.
---
It's a bit weird this meme, everyone is so desensitised to the liklihood the potus may have had him killed to keep him from revealing, well, I think we all know what the only reason he'd have him killed is

i love the drifter so much. Theres so many of his lines that are favorites of mine.

Dremel with a small cutting bit, just take small passes to get the outline first.

To be fair, they too have probably died from hitting a rock wrong.

I rode up to the Pike store, he said whats your budget

Ahh ok ty sir I'm new God bless you :)

Good thing us Guardians don't have a brain, gib subclass now
---
Just a tip, stay near the first area where you spawn in where theres big hole in the ground. It help a bit as the walla there prevent most vandals from hitting you, plus theres a good view of the other two areas.

Are you playing iron banner?

Stay woke
---
that invisibility is worthless and a huge waste of super time to go back into.
---
The invisable super with wall hacks that has a spamming instakill blade and uppercut that kills at range isn’t easy to counter. Also what are you talking about?
---
Yes. Ran it with my fireteam. Nothing special
---
I get ur point
---
Can you imagine how much the hive would hate us for having a power they want most? A darkness subclass given by the pyramid would be insane.
---
Thanks I believe this is actually why I got banned
---
Wtf is this...is this 1000BC? We speakin in sign language now?
---
What’s your gamer tag
---
It’s good, long story short we didn’t take his place at top of the metaphoric food chain and I imagine they are pissed we defied their logic about the strongest being at the top. I had to make reasonable assumptions about how they would feel.
---
Another point is resurrection which defies sword logic, but I would argue us killing Oryx in his throne world is more important then us killing him in the general universe. 
---
Tl;dr I assumed this breaks the Hives entire way of living because we didn’t follow their hierarchy of power/sword logic because we didn’t claim the top position, leaving them without a leader temporarily.
---
\*shoted\*
---
Their worm is what makes them live for ever (till they get killed), in return the hive must kill something else to feed the hunger of their worm. 
---
I forgot the name of the system, but this is not the sword logic, instead the sword logic helps determine to who the extra “energy” of any kills should go. Thralls feed themselves what they need, and the rest goes to acolytes etc. yes acolytes are stronger, but it’s still two different systems. 
---
The loss of the system could leave a powerful hive to be consumed by its own worm, as the hive no longer could feed it, this would happen even if the sword logic still existed. 
---
Likewise could sword logic completely disappear, but the system would remain as it is now.
---
But then again, who says there'll be a raid next season?
---
Papa Shax says I’m his favorite.
---
Same ran on Legend got over 100k without any issue
---
I’d love to, but we are on Xbox :(
---
Fireteam Tab on the app/website is a great source to find teammates. A lot of people willing to help newbies, as long as you can find them. There are many who have strict requirements, so try to avoid those. Otherwise, join a clan! Clan recruitment in forums are a great way to find clans and get guaranteed help for party activities such as raids/nightfalls/nightmare hunts/etc.
---
A pink ward
---
Lmao dude. You edited your own comment to exclude the word exotic and replaced it with super. 
---
Know what, you’re not worth my time.
---
Lumina thorn and last word are all their own weapons meant for differing playstyles
---
Lol, how original guy, stop trying.
---
Yes can someone please say how? Is there a special consumable or something ?
---
Any good raid group has times like this lol, gotta love it. Have my upvote bro
---
Yes please.
---
Personally, I love punching shit as a hunter. Nothing more fun than jumping off a ledge, stabbing a shank, and headshotting a vandal with your knife all while mid air.
---
Damn thanks bro
---
I’ll see what i can do but this took me 4 months to recreate this sorta thing because of school and stuff like that so it would be a while first
---
Thanks bro
---
bro 😎💪
---
Just cause you can put full time hours into Destiny, doesn’t mean everyone can. 970 is very high.
---
 He’s gone let him go
---
Oh yeah i never thought of that you’re right and thanks 😊
---
So it IS a different guy altogether??
---
Ok I will next time
---
Hunter master race change my mind
---
Thank you bro 👍🏻👍🏻
---
I didn't even do most pinnacles till last week and haven't done any raids this season and I'm dropping at 953 after ib and the dungeon today
---
Hover over it on the map. Its bergusia today.
---
I'm going to search who that is. Thank you!
---
This would be dope to have as a subclass
---
To this is so dope holy crap
---
Yeah. We did it with calus too.
---
very true
---
Funny I see all these posts and I'm the opposite I need kills medals been done for a long time.
---
Titans are better because, although we aren't smart enough to see color, we have the ability to find our way around by licking everything
---
i use these to farm for legendary shards
---
Those are iron banner bounties. Not crucible bounties.
---
Fun Fact: The voice actor for Shaxx played Morgan on The Walking Dead, and Saladin’s voice actor was Bloo on Fosters Home for Imaginary Friends!
---
It is absolutely filthy that he got them back to back
---
I’d rage quit out so fast.
---
No.. I got bounties from shaxx. They clearly say crucible bounties. I have a video clip of it and everything. I have been playing since beta D1. I'm aware of the difference.
---
Same! I’m at 99% medals and only at 87% kills
---
[removed]
---
Guardians+Venom
---
Bro the new synthoceps ornament looks dope
---
Real talk though these look great
---
Were they rebuyable or daily bounties?
---
Yes. Those bounties have counted for every other quest I have done. The redrix quest doesnt say anything specific.
---
Do i get to keep my thorn r34 pics?
---
If you can't play a team mode in Destiny 2 properly go play something single player.
---
What
---
Redrix is also a year 1 gun. It's probably different.
---
On the 920, I ran it about 20 times, broken 100k 8 times. Score was always 96k+
---
Checks out
---
Nom Nom Nom
---
Great work, OP!
---
I'd love new subclasses  like this. 
---
Perhaps light ones (angels) as well in the future?
---
Eat Greg, Greg is tasty
---
Well to be fair at least one of those 3 should have been the slayer of Oryx, right?
---
Nah, old iron banner armour looked so nice and I was a fool not to grind it out before it changed, guns have stayed the same so far though
---
IIRC D.A.R.C.I. is a Year 1 Exotic, which means it should be obtainable through New Light.  afaik you can't get Forsaken or Shadowkeep random drop exotics without the DLC they're from though.
---
I believe it’s around once a month or there abouts, but the armour does stay the same for the whole season.
---
Q.Q
---
I found it was easiest to get the medals by getting the cold fusion medal. Just need 2 fusion rifle kills without reloading to get the medal. Finished the bounty in about an hour 30.
---
So that’s why the past few days it was livestreaming some bs. Explains a lot.
---
The winner of a gambit match is often decided by who gets the first invade off.  Having a decent dedicated invader on your team means that the other team will be unable to invade you, AND will also be nearly unable to get any motes until you summon the primevil.
---
Of course, after the primevil is up, the invader should switch roles to counter-invader/boss dps, but until that primevil is up, the invader should not be wasting time grabbing motes.  Leaving the motes for other teammates means bigger blockers, and thus more problems for the opposing team.
---
Generally, when I play invader, I kill enemies for the first phase, until the first invade is available.  After that, I usually hang around the bank, immediately killing any blockers the enemy summons, and thus keeping it open for my teammates to bank.  Every chance I have, I invade, and try specifically to get rid of as many motes as possible on the enemy side.
---
With a decent team, there is very little time between invades, and so I will often end up on the win screen with 0 motes banked and like 15 or so enemies killed, as you described.  However if I were to just play as a normal player, and kill enemies/grab motes, the enemy team would inevitably invade us and make us lose our motes, and you'll be staring at 0 motes while the enemy has their primevil up already.
---
So...yeah.  Don't be so quick to dismiss dedicated invaders.  Invading in gambit is honestly broken, and IMO is the largest factor in deciding the outcome of a match.  Let us do our thing, and appreciate your ability to clear enemies in peace without fear of being invaded yourselves.
---
I feel this. Keep going Dad. Make em proud!
---
You can.
---
I love how a squad of maximum 3 Guardians can accomplish what 9 of Zavala's guardians couldn't.  *pathetic*
---
That would really mess with their morals when they are killing their own species
---
Taeko and her friends were basically useless, though. It's in the lore for Duty Bound. They spend all of their time before going in practising action hero poses like the Ginyu Force and then cry deeply as soon as the first Wizard shows up.
---
What!!! That's pretty cool, to be honest. I love learning about the different voice talent Bungie gets to work on Destiny. Embarrassingly enough I only recently found out that Cayde was voiced by Nathan Fielder.
---
Ahh all Gucci, yeah as the other comments state the event mode iron banner comes around once every month and is a separate mode that Lord saladin hosts (the separate vendor) and commentates. I think bungie would get a lotta shit if they tried to pass that VA as Shaxx hahahaha
---
Fillion\* not Fielder lol
---
Until you need to kill lost sector nightmares in the edz
---
First time to do it in one phase , last shot Miraculously got registered lol
---
Just wait until that mf 360 noscopes you with a white rarity sniper and then default dances on your corpse
---
Amazing art! I really love the concept of a guardian using powers of the darkness, it just intrigues me and your depiction of what they might look like is great.
---
technically the truth
---
Look at this man using cheese singles instead of shredded cheese for his quesadillas.
---
Yeah, same with “little light”
---
Thanks, but I already got it done. Over 700+ kills, nearly 100 deaths, and ***4 hours and 10 minutes.***
---
***"You forget you saw this"***
---
Used to be 5%, but they buffed it to 10% in Season of Opulence.
---
It is 4:52 in the morning was I'm reading this. Stop it. Stop making me laugh my while house awake.
---
Sick taken one-eyed mask
---
I commend you fellow yeet titan! Keep being awesome :D

Swarm

Depends on boss
---
Better yet, it's FROM $39
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
That's the LOWEST price!!
---
Not really, it was used to kill Dredgen Yor, but it didn't even interact with Thorn really. Yor killed loads of people simply by being really fast at aiming. When whatshisface killed him, Dredgen Yor didn't even fire because he was "supposed" to die then.
---
That makes sense!! I had always heard stuff here or there about some other PvP guy, but I never really knew anything substantial, and had no idea that's who the voiceover was! Maybe now I can get some of the event bounties people talk about haha
---
I had a friend explain this to me, this sounds like very cool, I would totally do it.
---
I got it from xur yesterday from the random exotic engram but too bad I got whisper already
---
That’s very interesting and helpful. You’re definitely right about the headshots thing. In CoD even the pro players deliberately aim for the body (and then flick up to the head) because the movement is so rapid that aiming for the head first makes no sense. I can already tell I’m going to hate aiming for the head more in Destiny, but thank you for the advice.
---
***\*Charges one thousand voices\****
---
Well, shit.
---
Again, it’s not well known (yet) so probably this fella just wanted to use his favorite super. Perhaps he is a new player and simply doesn’t know any better yet.
---
You can't, as the collection tab sees it as a random roll
---
The 4th slot when you inspect your gear where you can add the ' do additional damage against nightmare bosses' and stuff.
---
Would the taken titans srill be bros?
---
Didn't drop on 2 attempts for me today. I thought this had been patched a few days ago.
---
Traveler forgive the thing i am about to do

[That line was also in the original visual novel.](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/898/538/65a.jpg)
---
Ah I see you're a man of culture as well
---
That is why I hate playing gambit....but it has good weapons. Also people play the same way in Crucible. People go for kills in Iron banner and lose with bettter amount of kills. People never go for heavy in momentum and solo.
---
See not a lot of people know this but you get it from eating the glitter crayons. You should try it sometime.
---
Thanks
---
Then a scout sends you back to respawn
---
Wow, that's ridiculous. This weapon should be one of the top 3 weapon in the game, given how hard and long the grind is. I was thinking about going for it this season, since i'm halfway through the 5th reset but no. Not if i have to play 25 of each of those, especially because i probably won't use it anyway.
---
Owerings maul
---
They could do a lui kang style kick
---
Lol, that doesn't answer my question at all. When you choose the nightfall ordeal, you get 4 options of difficulty, each at different light levels. Which one did you pick?
---
I have a ♀️ Awoken Warlock that I carried over from D1. My Titan I know I deleted and recreated. And my Hunter I gave a gender change to by stashing their gear in the Vault (back when the Light cap was 305), deleting, and then recreating as a ♀️.
---
Lets pray Bungie adds the Desolate Armor from Destiny 1. I remember grinding to get the whole set because it looked so cool
---
The game needed to be free so they have excuses to push their lootbox store
---
I saw hacker only once
---
Ah, I thought you were asking what kind of difficulty I'm facing with it LOL.  
---
Is there any option to choose the difficulty?
---
I love that roll, though! (Jelly)
---
There's one more though 😎
---
There should be a clear path. Let ur eyes lead the way. That's how the game is designed. You'll get to a bridge, and just before it you'll find ur ghost, who returns u to 1st person.
---
It's always says Recommended 750 Power level or something like that, is that mean a thing? because I'm on 950 and it still feels difficult.
---
You literally walk forward, how have you ended up on reddit on the first 20 mins of the game 😂😂
---
I laughed way harder at this than I should have.
---
Well , i am on pc . And yes , i meant 100 mobility.
---
I meant Bagel4k. I know to Well who shin malphur is.
---
We aren't Marines
---
That’s not a person. That’s an asshole
---
I'm guessing I got a good roll? lol
---
I want to get outbreak perfecred so hard
---
In that case it is likely just them using things like exotic boots that increase Sprint speed, and lightweight archetype weapons that also give a boost to max Sprint speed
---
Kek.
---
I wish we could just buy old ornaments that we don’t have with the tokens for their respective activity. And also a decent way to farm bright dust would be nice
---
You’d be surprised🙄
---
Riskunner is pretty good gun
---
U r on console I'm guessing?
---
Outlaw is going to useful, range MW on duke in my opinion is fine but it has enough range on its own. Moving target will help you get those side step strafe duel wins. Overall it’s alright, but could do better. I suggest range finder or rampage instead of moving target as range finder will increase the damage potential at longer range and rampage will make those two taps ezpz.
---
Well, he's able to stop time. What do you think where all that ''Vex'' Milk comes from?
---
Please, *please* let me Saint-14 some fuckers, Bungie.
---
Damn vex and their weird time paradoxes
---
Me. I need 200 glory.
---
I was playing with someone with 102k bow kills
---
Thanks for ruining my no nut November
---
But it is
---
Where exactly do you get your info?
---
Ive heard that too. Not sure why ya got busted down for it tho.
---
“Powerful”s drop at a max of 950, no higher than that. “Primes” drop at your level. Yours is 951, so all “primes” will drop at 951 until you are 952. Then they drop at 952, and so on and so on(just “primes”). “Pinnacles” drop at +2 of whatever your highest level is.
---
Is this for the mysterious box?
---
Yea happened to more players I've heard. Can't complain tho hehe
---
Not tired not stoned it’s 4:51 and I didn’t notice iron bananas
---
Recluse is your new goal. You should be able to get it if you just play a bunch of Survival. If you have the Menagerie/Chalice of Opulence unlocked you can get a Dust Rock Blues shotgun from there. If not, run through the Pathfinder's Crash lost sector in the EDZ until you get one. Any old one should be good enough to get 2100 glory, but bonus points if you have Full Choke and a range masterwork. Throw on the shotgun, Sunshot, and Stompeez. That loadout should dominate against other new players.
---
I use this or stompees. Nothing else really worth it maybe dragons shadow but very few exotics are good for pvp. And since they destroyed supers I spec for recovery, mobility and resilience. The difference between 0-100 recovery is insane.
---
And its always lit up in all directions.
---
Hmm so this is who my teammates are /s (kinda)
---
Either way, there isn't anything we can realistically do. The guy has to work with support to get his stuff back
---
Good bot
---
I can't afford the season pass so I doubt it's that.
---
My eyes are up here, Guardian.
---
Destroy Dick December gonna be easy as now
---
Ah thanks.. guess the cruicble rank up is also a prime item?
---
Weird. Take screenshots and go on the bungie forum.
---
"my milkshake brings the guardians to the yard"
---
I feel like you don't understand that people's dissatisfaction is due to the fact that Riskrunner is an easily obtainable exotic. The quest for it isn't that hard, and it comes with the catalyst as well. The Riskrunner is by no means a bad exotic, and I fully agree that it's a great weapon. The problem arises from the fact that Xur originally brought another exotic, and for some goddamn reason, it's been replaced with a quest exotic. One of the easiest ones, that is.
---
I mean, if your guys are correct and Bungie will be supporting the game for so many years, what would the content even be without a good number of expansions?
---
Why did this get so many down votes
---
its just a visual bug
---
That hurt to watch
---
What can I say, except "delete this"
---
It is
---
I gooot this!!!!
---
Can confirm, my 970m still works fine for most games these days even if I do have to lower settings a tad, can still get 1920x1080 60fps though.
---
I got this bot!! No worries!!
---
Clap dem vex cheeks
---
Redditors don't like 4chanisms. Silly tribal nonsense.
---
You get it by activating max temper on one of the forges. If I had to guess which, volundr
---
Did you give them your credit card info before getting in a fireteam, sign some kind of waiver, or agree to it beforehand? If not don't pay
---
Thanks :), and ye I'll try sharpening up a bit
---
Is it 1% or 2%?
---
There he go.
---
Not a chance :')
---
That's stupid
---
Smaller content drops; forges, vex offensive, menagerie, exotic quests, you can keep a game alive off a steady stream of smaller additions, instead of massive expansions. GW2 did it for it's first 2 years and has decided to return to that model recently.
---
This better not awaken something inside me.
---
As of Shadowkeep, Destiny 2's new base Power level cap is 960. However, this max Power can be exceeded with the use of Seasonal Artifacts. These artifacts can be infinitely increased, offering seemingly unlimited power.  https://www.shacknews.com/article/102358/destiny-2-new-max-level-and-power-level-cap is just one of the many articles I have seen repeating this. I am pretty sure Bungie said it directly a few times during previews of SK.
---
So this is who Duddits was warning them about.
---
And then a Hunter says “And I thought Titans were stupid.”
---
And then some titan fucker wrecked the punchline by shoulder charging all 3
---
yeah did that in like 2 games while still actually helping the team win
---
Also you can use Destiny Companion app or ishtar commander or Dim to transfer weapons between characters without going to the tower.
---

---
Oh my b, thanks for your help
---
He went full autist, botted out and did bounties on the moon and obviously shared his account. Pog champ.
---
I have taken to reporting (Xbox) the people who leave survival matches early. I'm tired of the snowflakes screwing other people over because they can't bear the thought of losing. I'm happy about the freelance playlist though: got Recluse a couple of weeks ago, Luna's Howl last night, and am a couple of Valor resets from Redrix's Broadsword. Just need to work on The Mountain Top now...
---
Yup, and then 4chan adopted it. If it was just the WoW definition, it wouldn't be so downvoted.
---
Is it still not working?
---
Ahh, so this is the so called “final shape”.....
---
Yeah you're right, side stepping the legion of sexual assault claims against him, the man who has made overtly sexual comments about Fucking his own daughter probably isn't a pedophile, what was I thinking

haha ærligt, det er mig når jeg skal grinde iron banner og gambit, shiiiit,

This image was probably made for someone to jack off to.
---
Or at least to give the "Vex Offender" pun some substance.

Bagel was the first guardian to get to 1000 power level

I feel this so much.
---
I was indeed going for mida cat. Last one I needed.
---
This is fantastic art. OP should be in animation school if they aren’t already.

You are definitely showing me the toxic shithead side of gamers.
---
I've heard of furries. I've heard of people humanizing planes to sexualize them. But *guns?* They don't even look vaguely humanoid!
---
More bullets in the burst compared to other pulse rifles makes it easier to get the Scour the Rust quest bit for pulse rifle kills done.
---
Yes
---
got mines on my first run but its 10% now
---
Bud if the super Regen after a golden gun precision hit was not happening you were on top tree
---
Sorry I didn't care to put commas or separate my sentences but at least I put a period at end of my sentence.
---
Vexy
---
I use like 20ish mobility and use the recovery mod
---
I like my Vex EXTRA THICC!!
---
And? That’s just one opinion, And quite frankly, no one has to care.
---
It only counts as failing if you were trying in the fireplace 🤔
---
If you played 3 matches without leaving any, you’ll get 120 at reset. Congrats man
---
*cries in hunter*
---
Who cares, it's a silly action on a video game.  No one is actually putting balls on your face. Grow up kiddo
---
I think the new player experience is pretty rough, there is not as much direction as a lot of people would prefer. I recommend starting with the campaign, which is not very obvious. [Guide with image showing where to start the campaigns in order](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1878973112)
---
It would have cost you $0.00 to say that yet you did anyway
---
You playing camp of duty?
---
Gotta do your weekly 3 comp matches
---
I still haven't got the recovery mod :-;.  I will hope to get prime mods tomorrow.  I think i will get my Thorn tomorrow also.  I will use the Paragon mods on all my stuff now , to make better use of the build i am going for ( dodge  - melee ) .
---
Ty for the quick response now just gotta get those grenade launcher kills
---
I would have recommended outlaw and rampage
---
Hell yeah. Need my randy
---
Yeah that’s why I’m confused i guess I’ll check again
---
Yh armour mods are a lot easier to get at least the base ones are and thorn is a great gun. Pair it with mindbenders
---
Vex Gives You Harpies used to be a clan I was in, there's also Anti-Vex Moms that I've seen.

Thanks :3 Good night , it's 11:30 here and i am not a late night gamer.  I will reply here if i get stuff done. Thanks again !
---
Aw don’t worry bro, you have.....throwing knives?
---
We can definitely do that. Start around 10:30 sound good?
---
Alright np gl with your mod hunting
---
I use be able cheese it all the way using a sword as a warlock with air dash, so unless something changed it should still be doable, and videos should exist on youtube.
---
Recluse aint bad like its not op, stay far use ur shityy scour rifles or if ur daring use a handcannon
---
Are you using stompees?
---
Wait how do you get this shell? Eververse?
---
Yeah ik.... it has a awful charge time so why would you use it. It’s a pve exotic
---
I hope his life is long and his travels are safe.
---
Platforms never worked when I tried to use only 4 in a team, but 5 works like 90-95% of the time for me. If the platforms don’t want to spawn like they should, I just take the team to orbit and then load back in and that usually fixes it.
---
I can keep up on intel fucking hd lol git gud
---
bad bot
---
We need a Tea bag emote !! I would love this. I only tea bag tea baggers but would love to have an emote for it.
---
Gah it was hard for me to stop mashing respawning in the haunted forest.. running all the way back to where you died suuucks
---
Never set foot into the game mode but this post sounds salty af.
---
Was around a couple of weeks ago for silver. Won’t go for bright dust sadly.
---
I Just got it yesterday, and the first thing I did was defeating an invader with eriana vow in gambit.
---
The most painful part for me was doing all the rose quest just before this one, i've spent all iron banner , nightfalls, forges, PE, vex offensive,haunted forest and moon/mars escalation protocols with kinetic perkless rose....
---
It was fucking Painful.
---
No they don't matter unless they are gambit amour from the reckoning but don't worry bout that
---
That’s because you need to step outside private matches. Once you are in online multiplayer, they’re everywhere.
---
He’s using bottom tree. Top tree doesn’t hit precision damage. Celestial night hawk also works with top tree, it’s just a waste if you do that tho.
---
Oh my gosh so jealous!!!
---
And that's why I sided with the Drifter...
---
What can I say exept delete this!
---
It’s a weapon frame for Black Armory. I don’t know if it works differently now that Shadowkeep dropped, but look up how to start Black Armory, and then just make sure to get a pulse rifle frame and complete it.
---
Omfg the rose part of the quest is so weary.
---
Precision weapon targetting or shotgun targetting help, also try shotgun scavenger for more attempts, it gives you 3 instead of 1 extra shell.
---
This
---
People actually use snipers in MC...? They’re harder to aim than scouts, at least to me.
---
They made everyone start on 750 since the new light level is 960(technically infinite with the artifact) and yes you can buy foresaken still.
---
Did you just start playing then?
---
Those are events and cycle in and out. What you'll see next week is the normal amount. Iron banner will come back in about two weeks.
---
:)
---
And on PC were getting stuttering and lag when we try to fix our mods
---
If you're a Titan and have the Stronghold exotic gloves you can block forever with swords without losing sword ammo. I know there  was a glitch for black talon on that once upon a time, but maybe it's fixed?
---
I always thought that power level was just a barrier to content, while your gear has stats, which are not connected to power levels, are somewhere around 50 points in totals and only change with upgrade to masterwork
---
*cough* magnetic grenades with oppressive darkness on ritan*cough*
---
Go through the Bungie patch notes on their website, it will fill you in. 
---
Shadowkeep launching brought the base level of the game up to 750, so new player could jump straight. So all your stuff got boosted also.
---
You dont get exotics for legacy campaigns as of new light.
---
whats the objective
---
It would be nice if prime engrams could be dismantled at Rahool for a sum of Legendary Shards, like 10 or 20, because you're dismantling it without knowing what it is.
---
It’s rng with that it doesn’t always proc when you throw it at someone
---
No. Light level allows you to do more damage to the stronger enemies. The nightfall and new raid is 980 I believe. Yet gear only goes to 960. The artifact is the only way for you to meet that requirement.
---
We dont even have pulse nades which is the fuckin cherry on the cake. No one shot nades, no one shot melee, not even high damage high AOE bases.
---
Your opinion sounds right though. Besides, I have recluse as basically a permanent energy slot until it gets nerfed to all hell. And I would rather have my mountaintop or Izanagi’s Burden once I get it in place of the primary.
---
Y'all can't see color, but you lot eat colored crayons to be close enough
---
Was he holding a recluse? Please tell me he wasn't
---
And here’s the ritualistic me telling you r/angryupvote to your exhibition of being angry upvote, so... here you go.
---
Hardlaunch is better?
---
It gives vocity which is the thing that makes spike nades so good.
---
*edit also, range finder is better than Quickdraw. We also cannot see the masterwork, so this is far from a godroll.
---
Although it's a very good roll, not a godroll.
---
Goddammit I clicked off this thread and couldn't stop thinking about your comment and had to come back so take my upvote
---
Just so you know none of they y1 or y2 campaigns give any rewards any more with new light. The memory of Cade items are world drops and I get most of mine from rahool or hawthorn packages
---
Hello my friend I’ve just come back after a yr off have they put new iron banner weapons in the game or is it the same ones? Thank you
---
Some linears are secondary.
---
Don't bring in your pvp logic in here. The pvp community always complains about stuff and gets the stuff nerfed for pve activities. Fusions are fine. They've been fine since Destiny 1.
---
I havent had a "smooth run" of gos in the last week. Everytime i do it everything starts to tear apart on sanctified mind. Whether someone isnt pulling weight in damage or fucks on motes or lets gobljn sacrifice thenselves, it never goes well.
---
you have to physically go into triumphs and claim the triumph completion, then go back to eva and buy it if you have enough candy saved up
---
Well sorry for being a slower player. I have been playing since then. I just got to 950 yesterday.
---
How do i unlock toer 2 ans 3?
---
I’m guessing LFG teams
---
I just got the mask from a 950 nightfall the ordeal and I'm debating between it and dunemarchers
---
no a different challenge for a different encounter
---
Yo that’s dope, where did you get it? Or is it on Amazon?
---
I think this is a blue Frome from the forges. Forgot the name but they come with different perk options.
---
No but higher rolls are world drop only so getting truly great exotics now is kinda RNG centric
---
Crap, I forgot to post a flair, can someone update that to be a discussion flair?
---
Dang, just started playing 2 weeks ago and that was my second exotic drop.. will my peepee fall off and lose all my friends if I equip it?
---
Damn. Thanks tho
---
Destiny Comic Collection, Volume One https://www.amazon.com/dp/1945683953/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_K5WXDbRPWTZNG
---
If you’re higher light than something you deal/take normal damage. Power level only matters if you’re lower.
---
The gear you get is determined by your powerlevel without artifect bonus, the bonus from the artifact just allows you to enter higher lvl activities without a penalty to your damage done and received.
---
Yes. Typically Xur's and anything you pull from collections is going to be lower than open world or reward exotics. I got a pair of peregrine greaves from a 950 ordeal that dropped at 64 without a mod.
---
I could've sworn we had another week with the forest though?
---
Cool thanks!
---
This is coming from a titan main so my response my be biased but here we go 
---
I agree with you to a extent I don’t think oem 
---
Should just get disabled/deleted from the game BUT it does need to be reworked/fixed cues it even annoys me how good it is 
---
And I think one YouTuber maid a good point I believe thare name is cammy cakes and there point is that oem should be maid a bit more like another exotic titan has called mask of the quiet one and I think that is a good idea I’m not going to put what the exotic does here but it is basically oem but if it was balanced and maid for abilities not damage but that is all I have to say about this
---
I would love to see the tombstone one
---
Are your other swords masterworked?  Swords all have Impact as their masterwork stat.
---
Xur’s Fated engram can have a chance at high stats but then you add a probability of weapons so it’s kinda low but it’s worth a shot. Otherwise RNG world drops.
---
It's not so bad. It only requires a 0.5 k/d to keep progressing, but I kinda forgot about the quest and just completed it randomly one day when I was doing quickplay
---
Nope with bubble they changed it so blade barrage only breaks the bubble, but it wont kill anyone inside anymore
---
Me mad the boys playing destiny on Christmas
---
Pretty much
---
Also im pretty sure you can fight a striker in a bubble by meleeing him, if u have helm of saint 14 on
---
Well by that response I figure that you're used to people arriving early and considering I have a pair of testicles I guess I can be considered an expert on this topic
---
Time to start playing krunker.io I guess
---
Or maybe hunters just fucking dice the guy into pieces (not actually because it’s a T rated game)
---
Not so the vow can be infused so this is new
---
If the bubble is rocking...
---
Awesome pun. Wish I thought of it. Bravo!
---
It's been a year. I don't remember. I do know there isn't one for this year though and you only have the one from last year if you were active during that time
---
THE GUARDIAN HAS THIS HANDLED ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I use merciless because of the stability and range, with low zoom. It was also has an exotic perk not affected by the damage perk nerfs. It gives a 50% increase like the older kill clip. It’s intrinsic that lets it fire faster is good for shutting down supers or for follow-up shots.
---
You have to get it from the rare bounties that drop from the daily bounties. Its all RNG sadly
---
Maybe I did it last year, I’m not sure. Didn’t play much
---
I'm waiting, i just accepted ur frnd req.
---
Last word hand cannon is beast in PVP and is easy to get. Only takes a few hours
---
why does literally every screen in d2 have something that looks like htop on it
---
Or crimson all exotics have a finisher that would work
---
It could work if he comes back with no memories of the past and besides that how does exos work anyway
---
Damn I have a PS4 code if I could I would
---
Ah, nvm then. Was gonna say that the third encounter took my group like 3 hours to get done right lol
---
DARCI can be pretty good for boss DPS with its extra damage on crits.
---
I’m probably gonna go for that soon but I’m doing malfeasance rn
---
Ghost cat probably knocked it over. Cats will be cats.
---
im not throwing pissy fits at internet omegalul
---
how mad can you get
---
Have some self respect oem is a huge crutch and you'll never get better by using it
---
Darci is eh now but was really good in the warmind days and lens had a like weekend of domination in the crucible but now there kinda overshadowed
---
How do you play solo not by choice??
---
Sounds good. I got my last word last night and I’ve really been enjoying it.
---
Make 20 and you can turn them in for A random ib reward.
---
Interesting, not one single exotic weapon.
---
Very strong and can get 5-6 kills easy. 
---
But can be sniped like everything so i dont know.
---
That was kind of an exaggeration. Any activity where I need people like the raid I will use LFG. Everything else(comp, iron banner, nightfall, etc.) is done solo
---
Cross save
---
Omg wow okay.
---
It had really changed in the crucible like so different
---
I don’t even have OEM so he can’t say anything
---
This habit always annoyed me from day 1 of d2
---
Your submission has been removed. We do not allow LOOT POSTS.

Great work Guardian! However loot/roll/achievement posts are prohibited to prevent our subreddit from being cluttered (we get way too many!) - please keep these submissions in the weekly pinned loot/achievement thread. Thanks!

Would it be good for Crucible though?

This needs more upvotes, and raised awareness. He has support from other major streamers and YouTubers, and we should protect our own. He came from The Division and is here to stay.
---
There are so many guns in this game that work to eliminate the skill gap. Pretty much every pinnacle weapon is basically "hey what if we took this archetype and slapped giant training wheels on it?"
---
edit: spelling
---
Couldn't do the jumping puzzle eh?
---
I am new an this is my favorite hand cannon
---
“Puzzle” implies that there’s a method or a trick to get past it.
---
This is a platforming fuck fest
---
Just to be clear, how Collections work is items are greyed out or unknown if you haven't gotten it before. In case this is not obvious, you can't just grab every item from the game from collections, you have to find them by playing first and *then* they appear lit up and you can replicate some of them from collections. 
---
Secondly, items that say on them "random perks: cannot reacquire from collections" cannot be reacquired. 
---
Third, it does cost currency. Do you have enough of these?
---
If it’s a random rolled weapon it can’t be re purchased. You might also be out of space
---
Nice joke
---
I see. Ten paces is alright but I prefer Service Revolver, personally. Don't forget to get unstoppable hand cannon going on your then paces (it's from the seasonal artifact.)
---
Where do you find that info?
---
A 0.43 bodyshot ttk from 20+ meters is pretty powerful and hard to counter.
---
Yeah, one eye really just annoying to me but, most of the time I don't really notice it. What really grinds my gears is recluse, johtun, and colony. Johtun and colony is mainly the auto hit just makes me mad and there's really nothing I could have done. Recluse because the TTK is just sick and also they people use it just annoys me.
---
SOLVED: it's the random perk issue. Thank you. So if I get the weapon without random perk, it will be able to to be purchased later?
---
Confused Unga Bunga
---
If you’re trying to do it solo, that’s your problem. It’s meant for a fireteam but I’m sure people have done it solo. 
---
It’s honestly not so hard. The worst part is jumping, not the enemies.
---
My dad has ace
---
That's the point. They remove the SBMM so it's a chance to get good/bad teammates.
