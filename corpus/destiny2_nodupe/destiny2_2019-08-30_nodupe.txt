The Battle Pass is an extra fee.
---
---
---
I love the shooting and the game is a lot of fun. It's why I came back but holy shit the drop rates seem so so bad. 8+ hours a day for the last 3 days and zilch.
---
Ignore the troll and move on.
---
PvP rumble... grind it. You‚Äôll find that laggy fella in the corner eventually
---
The second it said ‚Äúenemy has summoned primeval‚Äù it died
---
Terrible RNG.

You're feeling the same way I did after 30+ completions without a 1K
---
Me in Gambit Prime, as my Titan colourized 2019
---
Mercury is like California.
---
It's pretty....but man does it suck.
---
(Sorry if you're a Cali native)
---
No it is not. If you get Shadowkeep then you get Season Of the Undying and that comes with the ‚Äúbattle pass‚Äù
---
If you purchase Shadowkeep you get the season of the Undying and the season pass which includes the "battle pass". Each new season will be 10 bucks and they will also include the "battle pass". It's literally additional content included in the price for each season. The annual pass last year was 34.99 at launch. With the new system it'll only be 30 bucks for the remaining 3 seasons IF you opt in to buying them all. Even then if you dont you still get access to the free tier of the battle pass. You're not paying an extra 10 for season of undying. It's included in Shadowkeep. Just breathe and read, man. Inform yourself.
---
Dayyyyyyyyyyyyyum.
---
Got'em.
---
Hell I would take any exotics at this point. I mean anything, just to see a few drop here and there. I've already finished all my weekly stuff and it's Thursday. So without the exotic chase I feel like I've got nothing to log in for until Tuesday. I almost feel like I did when I used to farm mounts in wow. I'd log in on Tuesday /Wednesday do all the old raids nothing would drop and oh well nothing to do until reset.
---
Plz don‚Äôt tell me you are one of the people who say ‚Äúmuh pay to win.‚Äù
---
You must be fun at parties.
---
Yes, because that's what blind weak willed little fanboys do. The look the other way when they are getting ripped off.
---
ALL THE CHAOS REACHS!
---
Go on...
---
"Howd you die"
---
"Yes"
---
I always go back to orbit
---
With the free version of the Battle pass. There is a "premium" version also.
---
I know. I'm sorry. I'll uninstall and unsub.
---
Actually if you look at the screenshot of the season pass, you can Clearly see an auto rifle. That is no skin.
---
The only difference I‚Äôve had within the last 2 weeks is now I have all 3 characters in free roam universe. Some reckon that could be the difference but up till then it was constant grind for anything
---
So goddamn lucky, IMO the Fallen are the absolute worst to fight with how much they move and their damn cannons and servitors.
---
Real Titans are trying to get kills for the Jade Rabbit Catalyst while getting thorn kills in Crucible &amp; Gambit.
---
bruh
---
I got mine on the second volundr forge I did
---
Because destiny‚Äôs writing is trash but at least in the opening in the sequel we know who we are, we know who we‚Äôve killed and we have some attachment of some kind to the tower and some of its inhabitants 
---
But for new players in the second game they‚Äôd probably have to ask ‚Äúwhy do I care?‚Äù When ghost cries about ‚Äúour home!‚Äù
---
It looks very nice ! What type of frame is it ? (aggressive, rapid fire, adaptive)
---
Np, and I didn't mean you didn't do a significant amount of damage in actual numbers, I'm sure you did because Jotunn is pretty good for boss damage from a special weapon.
---
It is an adaptive frame... apparently there is an OG black hammer roll on it which is cool.
---
a'ight, I'll keep my eyes peeled, cheers!
---
I stopped using hammerhead to use J√∂tunn in the fight .It secondary cannot out dps a heavy. It take a special breed.
---
I have done the math and I came with the conclusion that it is YOUR choice. Also wdym by ‚Äúopulence engrams‚Äù? You are also not giving enough context.
---
And it's just a random drop from that nightfall ? Well damn.
---
When your teammates take the heavy ammo to waste on ads or bosses. And then the Invasion Portal opens after a medium or large blocker gets sent and they clearly run past it.
---
You gotta do what you gotta do.
---
These kids just not have headphones or???
---
Out of 3 runs I got 2. Not even hitting 10pk or even close. Just speedruns. Worth the time, I find it's probably the most comfortable sniper I've used.
---
Good news for you, it looks like they‚Äôre doing a best of year 2 engram next season for season of undying
---
UNBELIEVABLE, SEVENTH COLUMN
---
It's weird we've swapped leader to all 3 of us and no prompt to start still, reloaded game and tried again and same result.
---
Awesome, thank you!
---
Sadd
---
Only available Friday- Sunday I believe
---
While I get the logic, especially since with the dreadnaught you're right they wanted the space to feel bigger (though there I never minded so much cos it felt like eventful stuff was closer together) I doubt they would've intentionally done it again in this scenario, it's more likely that they build it, and something about how they built the area, maybe something to do with the garden or the public event, broke sparrows, and they'd have had to rebuild the entire area from the ground up

am i dumb and read over that?
---
"Pre-order to also receive the Two-Tailed Fox Exotic Rocket Launcher and an exclusive Hive-themed Ornament once Destiny 2: Shadowkeep launches."
---
As an MMO the current content drop is expected to be had, but for a F2P which they‚Äôre switching to, to lock exotics behind a paywall within the current season is scummy, considering their competitive pvp component, assuming there is no way to earn them outside the pass but if there was they‚Äôd say it to alleviate this criticism
---
Well bungie said f*ck you, on september 3rd they are making mountaintop easier to get.
---
shit you‚Äôre right. i read over that
---
Title bait. Not even that vigorous. Turn dpi to 16000 then well talk.
---
once i got gently sloped to my death by those rocks and it was painful
---
WhAt iS tHiS wAtEr MaRk
---
Yeap same. Literally 90% of my iron banner matches have ended in Mercy Rules.
---
No you're not stupid, they're doing the same thing they did with the forsaken pre order items, can't remember what the description is on the PlayStation store so I'm not too sure if you read over it or not
---
You were robbed of that
---
&gt;	Plus none of us go to mercury often enough for it to matter.
---
Probably the real reason
---
I‚Äôm in pain
---
That's what I did usually just jam music during pvp it gets me focused more than hearing shaxx or the drifter the entire time
---
Aim at bad man, bad man go boom
---
 Never forget spooky trials in D1. Those were the days

I know, I dont wanna talk about it. The amount of guilt I have using using fighting lion and militias birthright is not okay.
---
I don‚Äôt know who
---
Ok thanks
---
I like it more than the bright engrams, im complaining about the lack of like earnable exotics say like a crucible one for getting 750 kills or something
---
Essentially yes
---
Iron banana made this 1,000,000 times easier for me
---
And god I can not wait for them
---
25 is my bad was actually 35 but that seems completely reasonable to me. It should be 35 for all players including the pass owners in my opinion. I say this as a pass owner. Or just another exotic quest/RNG drop. Having gear tied to this pass that is non cosmetic isn‚Äôt fun. How can you even get excited about the drops from Vex Offensive even if they are slightly better stat wise when you know you‚Äôll be handed them eventually anyway?
---
October doesn't help me now, in the years this game has been available to the public.
---
Not once have I seen a "gg" from a completed strike or successful crucible/gambit game. I constantly feel alone, yet somehow people form guilds to pubstomp on the regular. This keeps casual and new players in a constant state of dismay.
---
So the 25 premium exotic that they have not stated is possible to acquire outside is ok to you, in a F2P?
---
I wasn't so lucky I only wiped a team once if even that.

---
You know, I kinda wish they'd give us access to sparrows on Mercury. There's no reason not to unless there's a reason made clear by lore. But I've never even heard of anything like that. Maybe I'll go check out Ishtar Collective and see if there's any precedence for it.
---
*Grow Dummy Thicc from Stronks*
---
Atleast I ended your super
---
I think it would be great if we could have legendary armor sets that give us an exotic perk if we wear the full set. E.g. raid armor set gives an advantage for the raid.
---
Meanwhile I clinching my fist over the Gambit &amp; Crucible weapons
---
Grinding for Hush &amp; Revoker was not fun.
---
I would love for that to be true, again, I'm yet to see a single typed message, spoken message, not even a single GG.
---
Solstice boots make every male ache like a teenager on spandex
---
I just want my supercell back lol
---
Sure, if it didn't cost extra
---
Fellas, this is prime example of a person talking out of their poopy hole
---
PC?
---
Read up on the content you ignorant pleb
---
Gambit prime?
---
They‚Äôve already responded to this saying that trying to implement the sparrow in mercury brought up more problems and was just more of a waste of time.
---
Aha, so you were up for the challenge.
---
crota!!!! I remember dropping the crota ghost. It‚Äôs beautiful.
---
This would be us if we just straight up deleted Mercury for more content
---
*Dust rock blues has entered the chat*
---
Cause they dead they are sisters to Croata you kill them in the taken king Raid
---
you mean Supreme Leader Gary-Vagina mouth,leads of the Red Lips
---
Honestly from playing with it, just seems like the majority of other exotics don't do much for the general combat of crucible. Unless you're really craving a very specific effect, like the melee ability refresh from insurmountable skullfort, or stand asides, or the bonus super on melee kill from doomfang, etc.
---
OEM is just a good general catch all for playstyles and subclasses. Almost no matter what you're doing in crucible, OEM's effect will show up. Now whether it's going to help you depends a lot on your playstyle. It definitely helps for things like shotguns where you're likely to get hit going in for the shotgun kill, and OEM's effect can help you survive long enough to kill a second target when doing that. Maybe - if the first person you reach is the one who triggered it. 
---
I tried using OEM for a while and didn't like it. Honestly the amount of times I've died and it truly felt like OEM was the reason I can count on one hand. Usually in my experience the OEM user either kills their opponents without triggering the mask until after they've killed the last one, or they die. There's not really an in between - seeing someone survive a fight with OEM triggering *before* the end has been exceptionally rare for me. With the current duration of the buff also, its quite infrequent to come across someone who already has the buff.
---
And if you do you can just one shot them with a sniper headshot anyway so I don't see it as much of a problem.
---
Until you‚Äôve actually experienced how it works there‚Äôs no reason to get yourself worked up over it. Don‚Äôt be one of those people who take a small piece of information, rage about it, then find out it‚Äôs actually pretty good.
---
Ultimate trolling
---
Wha-
---
Yeahhhh but it's the curated roll that's so gas, hence why more people have it than one might think
---
And the bus driver is a Titan knee strike.
---
From a visual novel called "Last man standing killbook of a bounty hunter" or something
---
Well said, if your not sure perhaps don‚Äôt buy the full annual pass until you‚Äôve seen how it works.
---
Ye but this thing can go south real bad... its not that I hate it I am just sceptic about it.
---
I‚Äôm also a dev. everyone knows coding is easy and doesn‚Äôt ever have complicated problems 
---
man I love going on the internet and lying.
---
Bungies fault for forcing gambit matches
---
Yeah I feel you. I‚Äôd really hate to see destiny become a clusterfuck again so every bit a new information that my be controversial scares the fuck out of me.
---
Took me two weeks with no multiplier to get my 5 resets. Got it last Saturday. Am on controller on PC with a full-time job and a wife. The grind sucks but is def doable before end of season.
---
I fishy situation? Pretty sure that isn‚Äôt right.
---
Mercury
---
You have to admit that the quality has been lower. They haven't put out anything D1 quality ever in D2.
---
It will be like 7 millones times easier to grind xD
---
Oh yeah!! Like any solar super would make the flame breath shout when activated, any arc super would make the call storm shout, and any void super would use the dragon aspect shout, yeah?
---
And for real, Skyrim and Destiny would be such a cool crossover, honestly, I'd die if it ever happened, but I'd die happily XD
---
I would happily have a conversation with that guy at a party about how utterly dumb people are. We'd probably bring up this post as well.
---
I prefer to turn with my back to them.
---
The reason console Titans are slow is because they vape to much.... Makes sense why we "need" One eyed mask! ü§ì
---
Can people please stop reposting this armor, this was one of the final armors of the game in its life cycle as a celebration. 90% of armors in D1 looked just like D2 armors or worse.
---
Just bring back raid ornaments that look that good.
---
I want to play warlock now
---
Hey good job man how long did it take
---
No because OEM has one whenever someone shoots you! ü§ì
---
Can we please be allowed to just stand on freaking rocks and ledges??????
---
‚ÄúDo you have any idea what my K/D is??‚Äù üòÇüëå
---
Bungie pls give good warlock abilities again. Thank.
---
To be honest I took a long break from Destiny for a while I was run down, but after hearing solstice was coming back I thought I can make up for lost time, so with me having already completed the story on all 3 guardians I fully done the solstice so that had my armour already on 750 then it was just the case of getting the weapons, which didn‚Äôt take much grinding after that.
---
Given the way jumping seems to bounce you off surfaces so aggressively, I'm pretty sure guardians are between 20% - 50% pinball
---
Makes sense im gonna try to do it for shadowkeep
---
Found it super easy on my warlock doing handheld supanovas, but I on my titan and hunter it's been a struggle. Titan I ended up using fusion grenades and chest of inmost light and for hunter I'm using shinobus vow and skip grenades. Did titan and warlock during IB 1 and 2 of this season, but I like that now all my kills are progressing steadily together instead of being being only 10-15% done on grenades while the rest were completed
---
To back that up, I have 25 infamy resets and only seen afk'ers twice, I'm play on console so I'd imagine they were using the rubber band method. From the posts on this reddit I reckon it's mostly a PC issue but it appears there's plenty of afk folk in crucible and gambit on that platform
---
Bad rolls=dismantle 
---
Good rolls=keep 
---
Very simple op
---
Mercury doesn‚Äôt exist
---
no shit, it wasent what he was writing
---
Actually spiders are Arachnids...
---
He's just a troll man. 
---
He didn't put the screenshot and just doesn't listen. Nobody is this stupid.
---
In the lore, exos are permanently killed if their data storage (memories) are destroyed and I dont know about you but Cayde was pretty messed up
---
This. This is AMAZING! The cross-over I didn‚Äôt know I needed but now I must have. I‚Äôve spent a few hours in both games.
---
Use powerful gear rewards for general leveling. If you want to target specific slots you have menagerie for weapons and armour, iron banner while available for armour, forges for weapons and exotic quests for weapons.
---
The infinite forest should be turned into a forge mode similar to that in halo 3/reach ... endless possibilities
---
But nobody has been forced to play gambit or crucible... the sense of entitlement from afk'ers is breathtaking
---
Its ok people like these are the braindead people you see in crucible
---
as someone who is a fan of D2 and Undertale. I love you and thank you for this
---
I always log in at a minute after reset because I just figured it would take a fresh restart to load everything in. TIL space wizards are gonna wizard.
---
What makes lord of Wolves so good? 
---
I‚Äôve never used it.
---
Clearly the only way to resolve this argument is for bungie to release the source code for mercury so that the reddit armchair experts can analyze it, thus they can finally find out the truth, they will then finally be able to remove their fedoras and let their greasy hair down, and finally rest on a grateful universe.
---
Lmao dollar store, first time I've ever been labelled cheap lol especially as my experience is based off playing the game from day one until this season. I have been far from impressed by the content that I have wasted my wages on.
---
Yeah same, I mean cause of reset times im usually eating dinner so I'm not actually on at reset - I just assumed you'd have to go back to orbit then go back down for it to load in haha
---
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one!
---
I just want symmetrical arms for hunter. Titan armor is alright, Warlock armor is bad, and Hunter armor is worse. There's literally only 3 good hunter armor sets and two of them are from raids.
---
I just wish warlocks didn't look like makeshift space hobos now
---
Idk why someone would be jealous though. There are like 21 ways to get powerful armour every week, not including raids and prime engrams.
---
Nobody can just deflect the Emerald Splash
---
I'm on xb, if you need a hand hmu (gt: cps1974).  Taken armaments, swarm of the raven with taken spec (&amp; spike nades) &amp; malfeasance ftw. There is a cheese for the elevator room also
---
You are right however cayde would come back as a normal person as his ghost has found a new user, aka uldren
---
Only one I‚Äôve had trouble soloing is Chasm.
---
This is the most unique description of something in Undertale that I‚Äôve ever heard.
---
Even in the lore cayde said he didn‚Äôt want to be revived because 6 is a lucky number
---
At reset, Saladin runs up the stairs, arms full of supplies, sweating really bad, and dragging a rolling suitcase behind him. He apologizes profusely as he sets up his giant gong.
---
Seven minutes later, he finally gets it to light on fire, and he's so stressed out.
---
Cayde begs to differ
---
Nice, I need 25 more competitive and Rumble matches.
---
Iron banner never used to be this sweaty but then you have to remember we don't have trials and most of these sweats have probably got all they want/need out of comp
---
Solar &amp; Arc\*
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Cool setup
---
Lol. The first few steps aren't bad and the grind of headstrong can apparently be glitched so you don't even have to wait around for win streaks
---
[You](https://i.imgur.com/3pzpwxK.jpg)
---
At this point I don't even care if they completely re-use these AoT armor sets but with D2 shaders these were some of the best looking armor sets I've seen in a game ever
---
One Eyed Mask.
---
Save all your gunsmith material and telementeries so you can have a chance at new exotics and new mods for armor 2.0
---
As someone who only restarted playing again a month ago (the last time I played was back in season 1) this makes me happy, THERE WILL BE A TON OF LOOT!
---
Boi
---
I'm fine with Shaders not affecting glow colors. I can work around that, Shaders not affecting the armor/cloth itself is what can frustrate me.
---
Nope, I‚Äôm pretty sure he meant hunter.
---
Actually how it feels, so I just use arcstrider instead
---
Thanks, didn't want to waste my time. Been taking me three seasons to get this done. I don't play a lot of crucible and usually mix up events.
---
I mean... what does chill pvp even mean? When I play any pvp I'm trying to kill you. Like, really trying. If five of my buddies are on, we all 100% wanna kill you. Together.
---
I don't get what people think quick play is/should be. Maybe hit up strikes?
---
Only if it was a kill, hits don't refund bullets.
---
Dam that's sexy
---
I think D2 makes up for having less cloak designs by having a handful of really nice cloak like Cayde‚Äôs cloak, the solstice cloak and a few others but yeah more cloaks would be cool my ideal dream cloak is a full cape like the solstice cloak a big hood also like the solstice cloak and a feather collar scarf like the tangled web cloak
---
Phantom menace style in 2nd part of Val'Cour fight.
---
Ha you got bagged son
---
I said this in a thread the other day, but why can't you just not let your postmaster get full instead?
---
I don't see a problem with it. The people who play the game most will get everything free.
---
To fist of panic titans supers were a laughing stock. Don't forget that usually you just didn't cast the super until you are sure the titan is respawning, usually that buys you exactly 1 second because titan movement speed is op.
---
Took me a sec, but I get the joke now lol.
---
Yep, but he didn't kill anyone. Just landed a few shots.
---
my go-to is the tangled web.  It‚Äôs not the great.  Scarves would be a good addition as well.  I love the binary phoenix, i wonder why they changed it to a chicken head instead. üòÇ
---
Can‚Äôt they just understand that the space frogs stole our giant magic space ball?
---
He was very obvious on the radar.
---
Hopefully its on that they will remove in shadowkeep.
---
*Laughs in stompees*
---
Oh that. It‚Äôs not just the reaper‚Äôs job, but the reaper (in the right gear) is best at it.
---
Yeah, I can see that happening.
---
All right, that‚Äôs fair.
---
This is %10 Cabal, %20 Fallen, %15 percent concentrated power of Hive. %5 Vex, %50 Scorn, and %100 reason why I hate the Scorn.
---
Any armor that you can currently acquire will be 2.0 after launch. Now as far as iron banner sets, that‚Äôs a different story. I‚Äôm assuming the iron banner armor wouldn‚Äôt be 2.0 until an iron banner happens in year 3. Besides that though, any regular in game sets (not part of events) will be able to be reacquired as 2.0, you‚Äôll just have to grind for it
---
Depends on the recoil direction stat. For the most part, counterbalance is the thing.
---
The people complaining are stompee hunters?
---
I've been having a good time, to me that means not playing like crap.  I played 5 or so games yesterday morning and didn't win a single one.  But for the most part I've been playing better.

The deluxe edition comes with the 4 season passes.
---
alright
---
Thanks. It's the only Striker tree I haven't tried yet so I wasn't sure if it was worth putting the time into but I'll give it shot.
---
seconded.  I too am keeping mine
---
#relatable
---
I‚Äôm not sure if only you can see it or not. It is definitely a bug, it happens when I‚Äôm using the guitar emote and then a dance emote as well!
---
Yes.  The Deluxe Edition comes with the Season Pass for the next 4 season updates.
---
Right, ‚Äújust do it‚Äù. 
---
;-;
---
on console it's meh
---
Forsaken isn‚Äôt included.
---
All the people downvoting that dont get the joke lol
---
In Shadowkeep?
---
So because hunters have good subclasses, oem and stampede are balanced?
---
Hunters have great mobility. The wall hacks on middle void shouldn't have been introduced. That doesn't mean that a striker titan with a wall hacking, full healing, over shield giving exotic running around in a super with nuttso armor, desyncing dash attacks that regenerate about their cost on a kill is anything but out of balance.
---
I mainly play warlock and frankly, I'll fight hunters all day over bottom tree oem titans. It's not pretty.
---
To kill guardians?
---
we need a sword meta
---
Only 2
---
They vaguely mentioned it in the plan for future seasons. Like they want a more continuous flow of seasonal content, so the Vex Season of the Undying stuff might go away after the start of the Season of Dawn.
---
People have also speculated that this might also be retroactive, but it's unconfirmed.
---
*season pass
---
Both look sweet! Star Wars kinda style I feel. I often have flashy looks, then I want to have that space western style so I waste a bunch of shaders swapping over haha Theeeen I wanna go fresh and popping again, so I'll do the same and so on. Maybe there's lots of Guardians that do the same.
---
You have to kill every night and especially the last two nights before you kill savath√ªn
---
Why are you acting like you have friends that want to come to your party
---
I dont know why, but this is fucking hilarious
---
Funny, last time I checked, a sorrow mg2 can come out of a common engram. You find it on the ground
---
Some form of in-game LFG (comparable to global or recruiting chats in MMOs) is a feature players have pined after since day 1.  I think adding an in game LFG of some sort would probably solve the problem you are concerned about.
---
I do agree with you mate. 
---
The MMO title to the game do not seen to fit nowadays. I actually put a question mark after 'MMO' in some notes I¬¥ve made, because the choices Bungie made seen to fit on a FPS RPG only, like you said (they mention Action RPG). 
---
What I am trying to start here is a discussion to create awareness on this situation. Since Bungie wants to create MMO aspects, they should invest in more than cross-save and f2p. Yes, groups are the norm and actually good, but it should be looking for ways to implement a MMO world like it is announcing. 
---
For example, what if they just implemented something similar to Monster Hunter World? There is a multiplayer hub, people can and are encouraged to enter on other players games, and there is communication made with simple phrases (thanx!, yep!, no!, over here!, etc...) and emoticons.
---
DPS!!!!!
---
Yeah my friend just told me we had to not kill her before her final phase in the middle, I thought the knights we were kiling were the guys so when we got to savathun he just celestial'd and we killed it when it was on the left side.
---
You‚Äôve gotta kill the big knights BEFORE the shrieker.
---
Yup, starting on the season of the undying the leveling system will be revamped into a battle pass, if you dont pay for the season pass you can only get the top row items, if you pay the season pass you can get the ones on top AND bottom rows
---
It does
---
I don't know about vague, it seemed pretty clear to me that future season content will be temporary. Like, there was no other way the information they gave could be interpreted. There is absolutely 0 indication it will be retroactive, but I suppose it's not out of the question.
---
No it does not.
---
Haha, yea I should've seen it coming. But my nerves got to me
---
Ahh good thing I already have it. PVP is gona be a whole lot less fun in that case
---
Did you do the Special Savathun's song Strike, called Chasm of Screams? You have to especifically select that one, not the base one.
---
Win what exactly? Extra items that is probably already purchasable in Eververse? Pay to win is when you can buy your way to have an advantage over other players,  this is just a inconsequential shortcut for the people that feel like it on the reward system.
---
Guns and mods so there will still be plenty to grind for.
---
Does the season pass include the activities for that season or...
---
I get dunked on every time I see one of these fuckers. I refuse to use that thing on my titan.

D2 armor is to bright and vibrant

D1 armor was rustic and really gave that post apocalyptic vibe

I just received a catalyst from doing a heroic quest and I still didn‚Äôt get it. I was told catalysts count too.
---
Hey, man. If you're too shy I get it. No need to get elaborate on the excuse.

That's the motherfucking Senate you're talking about!

Thank you sir. It‚Äôs tuff out here
---
Thanks sir
---
Strikes underrated
---
Oh ok, do you have any ideas on where I could farm this gun with the highest chance to drop?
---
That was literally me. Rip
---
1. From my understanding, yep
---
2. I think the best answer I can give is this; I have the whole shebang on PS4, but was missing the annual pass on PC. After all the cross-save shenanigans, I saw I still had the quests, but couldn't make any progress. I imagine it'd be much the same. (I then bought the annual pass immediately, for anyone wondering) 
---
3. Short answer, yep. But you won't have access to the spooky moon business on your PS4. Basically the reverse card for my answer in #2.
---
^^youveneverplayedtubersimulator?
---
The gun never drops for me even though i open so many packages on io
---
Look at captain free-time getting an uninterrupted 20 minutes.
---
I want to be pissed on the fact that you havnt gotten delirium but i forgot that people dont waste there time in gambit like i do so uh yeah congrats now you can shred shit
---
Sometimes when people say they've done something a lot, they mean 50+ times. Other people mean they tried it 3 times. How many engrams would you say you opened?
---
Perhaps it's a tomb husk. Better to have it and not need it, than need it and not have it.
---
I‚Äôm more of a Vodka and Moonshine guy, but I won‚Äôt say no to whiskey
---
Most of the time when iron banner is around all crucible modes get double valor but the game mode itself does not give more
---
I think like 15+ times it‚Äôs very hard to get the io materials
---
You have to do the forges for the one with random rolls if you aren‚Äôt doing that already. As you finish the forge, it could drop randomly. I think I‚Äôve gotten it from the volundr forge a couple of times.
---
Are you using it for crucible or PvE?
---
I don‚Äôt have forsaken or the annual pass I can‚Äôt do forges sadly
---
Somebody threw the awoken relic at this poor old man and he doesn‚Äôt know he‚Äôs supposed to throw it at the Taken with immunity shields smh.
---
You better watch out, that dreg will comeback as a scorn screeb and ruin your day when you least expect it.
---
That's not a whole lot, don't lose hope just yet! If you have multiple characters, you can do daily bounties on all of them, for 90 materials per day. You also get planet materials just by doing stuff on the planet. 
---
I think if farming for Baligant gets too boring, you should try the Toil and Trouble from Zavala. I haven't used it much personally, but I have a clanmate who likes to use it in pvp. Bear in mind, this is a year 2 gun, meaning it has randomized perks. So one Toil and Trouble that you get may be better than another. You can read descriptions of what each perk does when you go to the details of an item, so you can kind of judge if there is a combination you like.
---
My first successful run on Outbreak,  I launched a slowva, he teleported out of the way and it just kept going, living its best life.
---
Oh so you‚Äôre trying to get the original one. Ok then your best bet is to just do a lot of activities on IO. Nothing more you can really control
---
How do I get toil and trouble do I need to open packages because doing strikes takes a very long time
---
I think you'll be satisfied with the purchase anyway, Forsaken is a lot of fun. The only reason for a higher power level would be to be able to compete in Forsaken content where the enemies are higher level, but that's all going to be re-worked after Oct 1st.
---
They are boosting everyone to 750 in order to level the playing field.
---
Also, in case you didn't know, power level is scaled so once you are a certain level higher than the enemy it doesn't matter. If you are power level 690, you'll deal/take the same amount of damage from a level 300 enemy as you would if you were power level 380.
---
Plus all of the new bosses just sit there and let you shoot them. No special attacks or abilities. Make a 1 Phase require skill!

You should save the background image just in case you register the copy of windows on your newer PC. Updates can't be opted out of, so if you have genuine windows it will force the content update and remove the wallpaper. Unless you don't care and you use your own image.

Me after the first five shots: "I think he's dead, but just to make sure it's calibrated, I guess just unload the entire clip".

YOU SHOULD BE THROWING GRENADES **AS I'M SAYING THIS!!**
---
I don't teabag, but I'll throw an emote their way if they also run OEM. Classic.
---
Literally why we need D1 style radar back.  GD crouching b.s. all over the damn place.
---
there‚Äôs additional emotes for when you‚Äôre in the air

Sometimes the only to kill a monster is to become one yourself.
---
I'd say that reducing or removing the loss of Glory with a loss would limit this issue significantly. The vast majority of people playing competitive are just doing it to get Recluse and when it's a pretty much guaranteed loss, those people are much less likely to be able to or interested in trying to salvage it. Getting stuck with bad groups is quite infuriating when you know you're guaranteed to lose glory half way through but you're stuck wasting your time being angry meanwhile. If you reduce the loss, you reduce the anger and the rationale for those who leave.

Is your chalice completely upgraded, as well as the slots at the bottom?

Where the ogres shoot you into the void.

I think you mean titan because they are so easy to use and hunters are the endgame class
---
Indeed
---
I need like 300 more to reset! I don‚Äôt think you kecked that Dreg enough! Better luck next time guardian!
---
but with the actual system if you start to play again in the last 2 weeks unless you put a lot of money in silver you don't get all the things, at least with this battle pass you know what you will get for rushing with money
---
Once you have upgraded your chalice to let runes of each colour drop, it's completely random which ones you get. There is not one specific thing that is more likely to give certain runes.
---
Looks great my dude
---
Dudette, actually! &lt;3
---
if u havent gotten bad juju by now im done
---
Now look here you little shit....

listen we don't eat raw crayons ok! we melt them down first obviously!

Titan main here: true for most of us
---
:P dude, duddette, what's the difference we are all guardians here :)
---
I'm fucking crying real tears.
---
Have an upvote
---
yes! the raid is on saturday
---
Vigilance wing used to be glorious. Especially with the full auto catalyst.
---
Like some of the others replies mention, nothing synergizes with Liar's like a One-Two Punch shotty. Swashbuckler would be the better between the two you mentioned. Liar's would allow swashbuckler to stay up a little easier. Keep farming guardian!

That's one way to get rid of ur frustration from gambit
