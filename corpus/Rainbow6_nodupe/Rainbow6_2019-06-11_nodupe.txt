Good strats have to start somewhere
---
---
---
it's a simple spell but it's quite unbreakable.
---
Zofia, Jackal, Maestro, or Vigil
---
rarely will 2 impacts kill blitz, you will usually need more
---
No operator is useless
---
I'll kill everyone in this subreddit and then myself if someone happens to my thicc boi
---
I was being real with what ubi had said at the time, doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm not hyped af for quarantine
---
A fellow man of culture I see
---
Jackal, Zofia, and Nomad are all solid choices depending who you already have and what you want to do.  Maverick is a bit more situational but certainly could be a contender depending what you want to do and what your current team's needs are.  It's hard for us to really pinpoint a single attacker for you because we don't know your play style or what your team situation is.
---
It uses a different engine.
---
Another thing I'm not a fan of.
---
Perfect

If you put them right under his legs it only takes 2, and if they dont you can tickle his pinky toe with a bullet and dbno him
---
Haha
---
When pictures are taken in such a way to highlight certain features is it so wrong for someone to comment?
---
This mission is hell but to be honest, you don't have to buy it if you don't like it. Burn out occurs in game design and this might be a preventative measure.
---
Splish Splash your opinion in trash...first of all TACHANKA IS A GOD
---
The game stops attempting to find a replacement once the match reaches match point.  However, if you join a game mid-round when the opponents have 1 win on the board and your team loses that round you have to spectate, you can wind up on match point by the time you first get to play in the match.
---
Same, ima be away over seas soon an wont have any rb6 with me so hopefully it‚Äôs like it but who knows probably not
---
Amazing! This is escorting-pro-teams-in-pro-league worthy cosplay!
---
ok ok ... Can you trust me now?? I SURE LESION &amp; PULSE WILL BE IN R6Q .
---
Present day, whatever year it currently is.
---
I know just saying
---
woah, looks sick! great attention to detail!
---
Good on you man, fucking called it, and as a lesion defense main I hope so, he better be in that elite lmao.
---
you'll rarely be able to do so against a decent shield player.

Holograms aren't the crazy part about alibi, its the tracking of your location using nothing but the current postition of a remotely controlled drone. How about Vigil making himself invisible to drones?  Tracking heartbeats through walls? A device the size of a sheet of paper, that catches grenades with perfect accuracy? I could go on.
---
But the president still being Obama? Hmm I‚Äôd like some confirmation.
---
Some people just don't communicate and rush in, no matter what I say. I tell people not to go by themselves up against a cav, and often they don't listen.
---
My favorite park is the IQ bangs, I really never see people show her bangs.

---
I also love that you used your phone for her electronics detector!
---
All in all, One Dank Cosplay.
---
I'm not buying, I'm just disappointed that, as a fan of Tom Clancy, that they are taking this route.
---
Oh no
---
The fact that you have almost half a year invested in this game and can't even get past the middle of the bell curve explains a lot about how irrelevant your opinions are, and how little you grasp of anything even remotely important.
---
Anyone who finds unbalanced content more fun than balanced content has the the mental capacity of a fried spud that's been kicked under a carpet and forgot about for a decade, and nobody ever has said Tower is a good map that should stay in the pool, in fact an overwhelming majority of players that have enough playtime to have a relevant opinion say Tower should be at LEAST removed from ranked pool because it's such an unbalanced map. 
---
So not only is saying "pro-balance is anti-fun" absolutely bonedead stupid, if it was in any way possible to perceive that as a proper, correct observation, you could not have picked a more polar opposite map to pair your claim with. 
---
You're literally too stupid and ill informed to realize that your own argument counters itself twice. Your opinion is irrelevant, but I realize you won't be able to accept and understand that, so I prepared a [mirror for you to talk into](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEo_thYmg3s) (the blue text means you can click on it btw) since I'm not gonna be reading or responding to anything else you say.

Here to find out the same thing
---
That‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs struggle as far as I know. 
---
It‚Äôs a rollercoaster. The more you play, the better you get, but there are so many things to learn other than getting kills. You‚Äôre still learning angles, callouts, good positioning as you play everyday. Just keep trodding on and work on your game.
---
in youtube ubisoft says: is new three-player tactical co-op shooter.
---
If it keeps the quality of the game high then I appreciate it. You can't do the same thing over and over. Are they calling it a tom clancy btw?
---
The skin is really nice, good work!
---
if you are on a strict contingent you have to speak the default language, for example anyone on the ISS also speak russian, they train for months to learn the language.
---
It was made by another team...
---
It won't
---
Where does it say Obama is president?
---
It takes place on planet Ooobesks in the year 252525 on the interdimensional calendar.
---
yeah i thought so too. But this one pretty much went "England did brexit, now we got a tyranical goverment and mass survilains everywhere because of it"
---
True coppers go up top and open this hatch before the round starts.
---
(True story: As Smoke I once opened this hatch before the round - it was casual after all - and then went and hid nearby. Three of the attacking squad happily jumped down and I lobbed a couple toxic babes after them. Hilarity ensued.)
---
I hope they carry over
---
Ah, I missed that, thanks!
---
Good days bad days. Maybe you ranked up a bit? Didn‚Äôt get a good sleep &amp; aren‚Äôt thinking as clear or reacting as fast? More noobs on during the weekend than Monday evening? Lots of potential reasons, no way for the reddit community to know why.
---
Skin actually glows, 11/10 take notes ubisoft
---
Couple reasons. First could be it was a free weekend and there was a lot of very new players such as yourself. Also there is a casual MMR that is constantly going up and down while you play. Also it just could be a mental thing. I know me and my friends have a day here and there where we just suck and to be honest most people aren‚Äôt pros and in a game like siege you get punished for having an off day. Also checking your settings if you‚Äôre PC since it can reset every now and then.
---
Kein Thema bin deutsch üòÄ Danke.

---
Tom Clancys LEGO wars!!!!
---
You were prolly put with a lot lower skilled players, so now the game is putting you against higher skilled players.
---
I'm somewhat sure it's that.
---
more about those whining bitches complaining this is not siege. or glitches from AI leaking into pvp again.
---
what i'm concerned is that this will be available via uplay+ a subscription plataform.....i dont like the sound of that
---
Thanks for reminding me that I need to filter out this subreddit because of instagram crap like this.
---
But Obama is still the President it seems, according to concept art.
---
The game player base on Steam spiked and peaked during Outbreak. No way they weren't gonna green light this game.

Concept Art, Harry met Obama in one drawing and Warden was protecting him in another.
---
Just the operator operating the operator.
---
There are three primary benefits to having a 3-round rotation.
---
1. If you fail to win in a round you can immediately fix what you did wrong and execute the new strategy.  When teams alternate, you have to remember what aspects you flubbed two rounds earlier and execute.  It's much easier when it's back-to-back.
---
2. The team can get itself into a rhythm on attack and defense much more easily.
---
3. I know your attitude toward the pro game isn't good, but Ubisoft does still need to consider players who watch professional play.  By having ranked mirror the format of pro matches the game players watch on Twitch feel more accessible than when the rule set is completely different.  There are players of every rank who watch professional gameplay and even if they don't aspire to be pros themselves it helps them to understand what's going on and possible even apply what they see when they get into the game.
---
Ya
---
Finka is a true QTP2T
---
Different regions have different ranks. Like i'm from Eu but if i went on US and got gold but i'm unranked in Eu and next time i came on it would show me my eu rank
---
They‚Äôre completely different. The black ice you could get in Y1S1 seasonally is the same skin as the one you can get in alpha packs now. 
---
Glacier was a pro skin from Y1S1 that you haven‚Äôt been able to buy for 3+ years now

So how much will this cost? I bought R6S one-two weeks ago and now I will have to buy it again D:
---
A ladder or some kind of slam dunk with a nail gun
---
It's a separate game, not a mode. 
---
They aren't making a Siege 2, they are sticking with this game for many years to come.
---
&gt; Because it casual , people tend to ban whoever they find annoying
---
Can you give a source for P&amp;B coming to casual?
---
You missed the cam with the first shot...
---
On PC? I got it to work for mobile but neither worked for PC.

---
That‚Äôs so stupid
---
The thing is that we don't actually know any info about the game. Who said it will be 60$? The game could be 30$. As for dlc I don't think it will be payed since rainbow has a strict policy about not dividing the community. Premium will probably only gain new content a week early. We also do not know what approach are they taking, like it could be open world since Ubisoft is known for open world games or maybe just mission based. It's just too early to judge for my opinion.
---
Would be nice to see Lion get more character background development.
---
&gt;Why anytime i go into casual is everyone either unranked or plat 2/1??
---
If it's a new account it's because the game has no clue what your casual MMR should be.
---
&gt; why does all of the stupidest stuff in casual work? Coppers can beat a diamond because it's a battle of dumbness.
---
Because it's casual, people aren't trying, and good players don't expect dumb shit.
---
&gt;  I'm a gold 4 who did road to copper. (I know it's toxic, but still)
---
:(
---
Makes it so much harder to enjoy the game tho
---
Bungie‚Äôs gotten better about separating PVE and PVP damage values at least
---
It's not siege. It's just another game from ubisoft.
---
Pretty bad isn't it? Can't even hit a stationary target...
---
I actually love this the PvE mode was fun and I can‚Äôt wait for the story that comes out of this

Many people wanted to see another game mode like outbreak again, and ya a totally different game run by other people within Ubi.
---
Just download the Xbox app on your phone and join parties from there (make sure you're not connected to your home wifi). Laugh as they try to DDoS T-Mobile.
---
It‚Äôs a zombie game. There‚Äôs guaranteed to be human enemies. I can‚Äôt recall many zombie franchises that don‚Äôt have humans v humans, except Left 4 Dead
---
&gt; Zombies have been done to death.
---
I saw what you did there....
---
Mozzie counter?
---
I think it‚Äôs a whole new game cause it doesn‚Äôt say siege and it was shown at e3 so...
---
I would assume your end of season rank, but i can't confirm this.
---
Hahaha Idk about all that I just thought it was weird for Ubisoft to use that many resources for a  free update on a game (excluding the packs they sold)
---
Of course, if it's a fun and good game, great.
---
 I'm just saying that Ubisoft is plastering the Tom Clancy name on 50% of their catalogue and not a single game with that name is true to what Clancy wrote about - I am kind of happy there isn't a new Splinter Cell game, because they would manage to mess that up too (as in, not being a Splinter Cell game, but might otherwise be a good game)
---
I'm not saying Siege is bad, in fact I like it, but it's not Rainbow Six, and this new co-op version seems interesting from what little we know, but again it is not Rainbow Six. And as a fan of Tom Clancy and Rainbow Six, I really do wish for a new proper Rainbow Six game and Rainbow Six experience - and I do wish they would not tarnish the reputable franchises which were known to be tactical, punishing and one of a kind experiences, with what they are doing now.
---
Because there are no stakes in casual that‚Äôs kinda the point
---
This image is just 640x360, so not very good at all
---
Many do. Ubisoft slowed his gadget swap speed while they work on sound fixes.
---
My time zone is CDT
---
Ela would be kinda useful, stunning a group of zombies for quick kills without being overrun, vigils would be useless(but love his guns)
---
Could use a hug
---
All the R6 ops are going to be in it
---
Bro, why does this remind me of "Me? I know who I am. I'm a dude playing a dude disguised as another dude!"?
---
I hate it with a passion. It's not as horrible as hostage, but my hate for it grows bigger than hostage
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure I was playing against a team that was doing this today.... it‚Äôs going full retard. If you‚Äôre playing another 5 stack they are gonna put a guy on each window, one guy below to watch for run outs and one guy across on the front bay window. You will be stuck with absolutely zero way to return to the room except through a doorway that 4 guns are pointed. Not sure what the motivations is... i personally like to win...
---
Nice attachments man. Good job
---
*#Matt Groening wants to know your position.*
---
Oh shit, here we go again.
---
No one is holding you back. Go ahead and delete the game :)
---
Okay, cool.
---
Who cares?
---
Every gameplay I‚Äôve seen of old R6S games has been the blandest shit I‚Äôve ever seen.
---
I feel their pain.
---
i mean, unless you're taking time off work for it ( which you shouldn't) it'll be up by the time you're home from work or school, or whatever.
---
It's the most balanced mode and that's probably why you don't like it. Get a grip.
---
That win / play rate chart is one of the most misleading things ever made. Stop using it to form opinions about balance.
---
Oh I loved it lol, I think I liked the siege PvE thing a lot more than most did.
---
I‚Äôve had a weird relationship with Siege. 
---
I‚Äôve owned it since launch, and put about 35 hours into it from launch until the beginning of this year. But at the beginning of this year, I got this itch that won‚Äôt go away. Since January I‚Äôve put another 50 hours into the game so I‚Äôm sitting at about 85 hours currently. I‚Äôve improved a bit since January with the help of my friend who‚Äôs been really into the game since launch. It‚Äôs great fun
---
I‚Äôm on summer break and I‚Äôm a teenager
---
Sony says no
---
Idiot.
---
I've done it with the p12. Pistols are very good in the game in general.
---
So you're idiot. Got it.
---
It‚Äôs not often you get a thatcher or a finka in casual.....
---
But is that confirmed? If it is then ubi is making a shit decision but if its just new season that they decided was special enough to make e3, well thats a bit different.
---
You just said ‚Äúit‚Äôs only outbreak.‚Äù That‚Äôs an assumption. Outbreak was 3 short missions. This is going to be a lot different
---
the do summer shit and be home by like .... 5
---
While i like bomb the fact they took out 2 modes in the ranked pool is just gonna give people less options for how they want to play in ranked and i dont really see a point other than to "make it like the pro league"
---
I don't like it because every single time I play it, I get a sweaty fucking wannabe pro who complains Round 1 and leaves if he doesn't get a kill or if he gets killed. Every. Single. Match. So yeah, if that's balanced then by all means its the greatest fucking mode in existence and should be the only game mode in the game for both casual and ranked
---
Quality ubisoft patch, as usual.
---
probably about half aren‚Äôt useful against zombies tbh
---
Yeah your right, and in my experience it‚Äôs a hell of a lot more of the latter
---
It‚Äôs not the name that restricts anything the name was chosen for a reason
---
You told me who you were, no need to repeat yourself.
---
Best quality video I've ever seen right there
---
Get a team together and play with them. Simple
---
Yeah Sony is dumb like that, but I'm still glad I don't have an Xbox
---
Thx
---
Greedy? There are a lot of things I could say about the creators of this game. Greedy isn't one of them.
---
Yeah I haven‚Äôt bought a single game since I got my Xbox1 (I give him some money the odd time).
---
I hope.not since it's not gonna far for console
---
Bamboozling.
---
If it was that easy everyone would be a developer.
---
It takes skill
---
I wasn't referencing you honestly, it was more towards the "PC Master Race" stereotypes that make normal PC players look like douches.
---
Had my eye on it for 3-4 years. By the time it finally comes out, I will be an old man.
---
They're catering to pro league because that's where the money comes from.
---
You assume we have friends to play with.
---
You're welcome bro. I'mma be serious tho that was a nice play
---
I don't believe this, but I think it's because I don't want to believe it.
---
Literally the best. Obviously its subjective to a point. But it is, without a doubt, the most balanced gamemode.
---
Everyone I know only has the fucking game on Xbox while I play on PlayStation. I can't get a team together if I get placed with low tier players when im solo queuing. Not simple.
---
The new game is humans vs zombies again?
---
For a sec I thot u weren‚Äôt but thank u for being genuine
---
Because I we found a amazing sightline into garage from the front room area and wanted to completely open up house but couldn't in custom game so started to fuck around
---
That‚Äôs my childhood right there
---
Find some people to olay with and run some light strats. Its how the game is meant to be played and its 1000 times better.
---
Make a 5 stack with Beaulo, Pengu, Macie Jay and Godly.
---
What's your gt? I'm as well on PlayStation and would be glad to play with you in casual or in ranked if you're trying to get better at bomb. I'm level 325 and that's the only mode I play.
---
you never go full Retard!
---
üëç
---
It was custom game there were no bombers
---
That's confirmed. Unless it's a F2P I see no reason to buy which would be not.
---
Like I said to another person, I can't find people if they play like they're fucking new to the game and or are trolls
---
Not only that, but I have 4 or 5 good teams I play with on the regular that are all level 280 and up and I'm sure we could sub you in

This wasn't funny but whatever.

---
Okay, But try also to see the perspective that people ARE most likely getting shifted around to other projects so people tracking and working in certain bugs may and actually do get pulled to other projects because this is what AAA studios do. Add on to the fact that a game being made that is so similar and reusing assets is going to definitely mean pooling from the devs on Siege. Its not a stretch by any means to see this is something that has been and will be going on moving forward. They decided to cash in on a zombie game instead of developing a real clancy game which rubs a lot of salt in the wound knowing we are definitely splitting dev resources here regardless of what they claim or people speculate. Its simply how gaming studios operate.
---
Is it going to be a whole new game?
---
I was thinking the same thing, especially Vigil.  My money would be on the White Masks having a role in whatever the new threat is.
---
I‚Äôll have you know it is still affective in high gold low plat, so umm ask you not to dis this strat
---
Then why are you on the sub. Stop playing it and go away.

You gonna be a old man next year? Hot damn!

I can tell you that it won't have zombies in it.

Yeah, an accident.

Yes

Ubisoft‚Äôs E3 press conference? They announced it there and said confirmed it‚Äôs a stand alone title coming out next year.

I did that once in T hunt by myself. I was bored and couldn't find the last guy, so I took down an entire fucking wall with my elbows. Great use of about 40 mins

I have a question for you. I‚Äôm trying really hard to get the Senseless trophy (last one before Platinum for me) and I‚Äôve been using Ting to do it. And I am struggling super hard to get flash kills. It seems like I can never accurately get them off, or there‚Äôs a Jager and nobody on my team to counter him. I even got a kill today where I killed someone by hitting them *with the flashbang*. 
---
Any tips for me to secure that last trophy?
---
Phantom* (forgot the m)
---

---
Love that their expanding the universe with characters we‚Äôve grown to appreciate.
---
Here‚Äôs hoping we may even get a traditional Rainbow 6 story game with many of the Siege characters too.
---
Don‚Äôt care about your ranked to much I‚Äôm level 104 and I‚Äôm in bronze, but I don‚Äôt care if someone say that I‚Äôm bad because I‚Äôm bronze

You don't have to use the acog, but if you continue to play this game you'll probably end up using the acog almost Everytime. When the game first came out I never used the acog either but then it grew on me. There's one really good player at this game who doesn't even use it. Just use the ones that you like.
---
My guess is boosters on console will throw their matches to lower the overall ELO and then group up with the person they are boosting so the matches are much easier. Anyone boosting on consoles is most likely using a XIM so there is that too.

Rainbow Six Quarantine Announced Early 2020 - E3 2019 https://www.ign.com/videos/2019/06/10/rainbow-six-quarantine-announced-early-2020-e3-2019
---
Here, i think this was pulled from the conference itself.
---
Yea, that‚Äôs dumb.
---
It's probably a mid season event. Operations last three months (I think). And we received the Rainbow is Magic event around a month into a season.
---
You say ‚Äúlately‚Äù like it hasn‚Äôt for like 4 years
---
Vigil was there too
---
People who don‚Äôt go onto a post just to say rude things, I guess
---
Are you playing on the Xbox one x? I never remembered siege on Xbox one looking that good. I play on PC and the graphics don't like that good but of course I turn turn lots of unnecessary settings so I can get better fps.
---
Perhaps they are like the Typhon from Prey and can take over electronics? He'd be invisible to cams and turrets and shit
---
Double yea
---
It‚Äôs such a low frame rate that I can‚Äôt tell
---
Ya know the trailer is cool and all but it doesn't really show siege as siege or the new operators being the new operators.
---
It was so obvious though. I remember telling my friends that. No way did it make sense for a dev team to spend that much time / resources on something like that and have it go away
---
And when a Monty does that you throw nitro cells/ toxic babes/ hit him with an echo drone. Bomb is about beating the opponents strategies with your own strategies. It isn‚Äôt simply a frag-fest like secure.

You may be teasing, but you've made me realize how much we need an R6-Simpsons crossover. üòú

I want to bash some Grunts' skulls in as Sledge. That's the only thing I wanted to do in Outbreak, but nooo, we have to go in stealthily and carefully.

Yeah. Glaz is meant to Overwatch through the smoke while capitou firebolts the Mira and rotate holes

Am American, can confirm he bible dongs hands with Luigi.

I'm guessing that won't happen because Siege is probably going to be the more profitable game long term. PvP generally has a longer lifespan for shooters and skins in Siege would probably sell more because there are more people to show off the skins to, 9 in Siege compared to 2(?) in Quarantine. And we still haven't factored in esports.
---
No you have to also be able to aim. But allot of the time someone rushes in and either gets lucky or gets destroyed and ruins it for the whole team. Also gold is the adverage rank it's people who understand how the game work and have semi-decent to good aim. Most of plat is just gold's who can actually find a 5 man.
---
im also interested, but seeing its a dev patch im sure its pretty exclusive to the people who make the game

Because he can‚Äôt make big holes and he can only open one hatch

Yessssss absolutely it should! Good call!

Do you have an HD version of the Alibi?

I dont get why people downvote ur comment and everyone else's comment saying it's a repost. This was found in the tts for wind bastion and aost everyone new this

It really be like that, also can't you use paint?
---
I believe it is on YouTube if you look it up but may take some searching.
---
I have no clue mate. I did not downvote you :(
---
Yes I could see on some maps but if operators aren‚Äôt versatile they will have a low win/pick rate and we know that ubi won‚Äôt buff her. Like fuze has been sitting and the bottom for a while but they have done nothing. I just think that ela could get vertical recoil instead of horizontal recoil
---
but whats your w/l and account level
---
Left on the pic I could see a sniperrifle and right to it fuze
---
So I supposed you are already doing it, no?
---
I don't think a single person wanted this as a standalone game. Why not just make it a DLC to R6. Makes literally no sense. Take off Tom Clancy's name if you're going to be doing shit like this Ubisoft.

WHY ARE YOU NOT PUSHING TOGETHER WITH US??!!

sum up my experience in siege so far...
---
Yeah i have 80+ hours on her but that was in white noise and chimera and im trying to get back into playing her and i feel her recoil is kinda just bullsh*t i will be shooting and it will just pull to the left or right
---
Sad to see so many people upset with this, but I can at least understand why.
---
To me this seems like the whole debacle between the COD Zombies community for fans of WAW and BO1 against the people who enjoyed the story of BO2 and BO3. Once aliens got involved the community *really* divided.
---
I‚Äôm excited for this, and I also hope they create a game soon in which we can fight against terrorists. THUNT ain‚Äôt it, but I‚Äôd be down for something like Patriots.

I‚Äôm so upset I won‚Äôt be in town to play it :( I‚Äôve been getting into Siege heavy honestly

Its a video game who cares aslong as its fun its fine in my book.

Is this what it looks like to try and make a 90 degree turn on console?

i recommend the reflex with a muzzle break. the recoil becomes a big o

Jesus Christ even has blitz main in the title, don‚Äôt get so salty over someone trying to have fun

Maybe, but i think that her gadget needs some kind of buff to make her more relevant.

No?

Yes, also the Australian operators need to be remove completely, then remade, then I might finally be happy.

such a shame

I've been bamboozled

New stupid camera system

And imagine being a new player and you choosing ela as your first dlc op right now

Is it a whole new game or dlc ?

Thanks i will give it a shot

Shit thats dark as hell
---
It‚Äôs a really competitive game and that breeds toxicity. Even GG can be toxic now, I try not to be toxic but most people can be at times just because the game gets frustrating. But that makes those rare positive interactions even better
---
v nice. when youre torching a line into a wall, you want your body to not be exposed. start more in the middle of the reinforcement with a angle, to not be instantly killed

Wow thats rough, she definitly takes a ton of practice to master as her recoil is hard. Try to get good with her shotgun if you can, it shreds. Personally I would buy Valkyrie, Echo, or Maestro on defense as they are the most fun and helpful for me and my squad. Their guns are also very easy to handle

I just don't use the aug. Problem solved

I‚Äôm litteraly sitting and just waiting for the uppdatera right now
---
Does the original play sound? I wanted to hear the ‚Äúphhhhhooomph‚Äô‚Äô of that launcher
---
Getting it on the first of April would be noice
---
I feel that this is u flexing ur level
---
You got headshotted, and how can you verify that he can‚Äôt see you?
---
Same
---
Till the test server? Wdym
---
Yes, and the Aug should also not cover 39% of the screen
---
I play a disgusting amount so is it less if you play less?
---
very true i like to try new ops so ive been giving him a shot but im moving back to hibana coz he is just too slow and i'd rather support the team instead of selfish ops like cav and vigil but yes he does not need any skill they need to rework him in the future \[hopefully\]
---
Im gonna disagree with the other guy tho. Use the holo for sure because its a spray and not a pin point, also go for the compensator for recoil when firing for a long time and the vertical grip, however once you begin to learn the pattern you can switch to angeled which i find very helpful.
---
Yep one step forward and 5 steps back and some how they couldn‚Äôt fix anything in three weeks of testing

When you mix fuel, metal oxide and metal powder, you get a cannon that can blast literally anything in its path.

Just out of curiosity I‚Äôve also heard the Aug‚Äôs trigger is quite annoying to use compared to an M4 is that true ?
---
Damn you right, Never heard the term image macro, figured that had somthing to do with spam uploading using an auto-uploader.
---
You maybe be right but I have seen plenty of high quality memes shared on this forum. However, they do lliteraly imply that they dont inforce this rule.
---
I feel bad. The first season I started playing this game I did ranked matches and got into gold 3. Pushed the season to gold 2. This season the same story.
---
The aug in csgo has a regular acog tho, css has the Steyer scope
---
i‚Äôm level 31 and have no intent to play ranked yet and this shit ALWAYS happens because i don‚Äôt know the maps well
---
Quarantine
---
I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a mix of both.
---
I recommend taking a look at r/SiegeAcademy; a lot of the posts there are really helpful.
---
Nah, we‚Äôll just get a charm
---
Stay pulse. Please

I got headshot, yes. Could he have seen me, probably. But i didn't see him and thats the problem here buddy. If the enemy sees you but you can't see them. I SEE that as a problem(pun intended)

I do that shit in plat if i have a extra works sometimes

So... Can we read it?

Your vision isn‚Äôt the very top of your head. If you get a perfect angle you can snipe someone‚Äôs forehead without them seeing you.

This is perfect. I almost feel the need to thank you for your service

Once again it's just a cheap cash grab from ubisoft for people who liked the event and people who haven't played it. If ubi actually cared they would've added it back into the main game not make a whole other game for this event.

EXTRA INFO:
---
The computers at the school are operated under the education department, meaning any custom program with an exe file (games, vpns, social media apps, etc) could not be run. This computer in particular somehow ended up with a corrupted OS, so one of my friends got bored one day and brought in a Windows 10 install USB. After this, he ended up with an unrestricted OS that could run any program he wanted. He was able to put a password on it so no body else could use it. He was able to get a vpn working and, afterwards, installed Steam and UPlay. He got games like Geometry Dash and BeamNG.drive to work but had problems with Siege. He sent me this earlier today as he finally got the game running.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
TLDR: School PC had broken OS, friend reinstalled Windows, ended up being able to install and run Steam, UPlay, Siege, and many other games.
---
"Mira Mira on the wall"...
---
man, that sounds like nightmare
---
you‚Äôre missing an e and an apostrophe in your your.
---
I get that but without adding a "fake" progression system how do they make it fun. Outbreak got dull very fast.
---
Expecting they have an actual story told in an order that makes sense.
---
The gameplay though with outbreak was just a bit meh. They claim its going to be tactical nd ubisoft said the same about outbreak.
---
The issue here is its AI zombies/monsters. It just doesn't translate into rs6 strategy. The only choice you make is what room/area you try to hold.
---
A panicked for a sec when I didn‚Äôt see lord Tachanka straight away
---
Yeah but glaz has to sit still now in order to see through smoke thats a nerf
---
Ok thanks, I‚Äôll check
---
It's probably because the season wont release till a certain time. Like 1 o'clock or something.
---
Castle is black
---
Holy hell good luck!
---
Oh for fucks sake, shut the fuck up and quit trying to victimize women
---
If you can‚Äôt handle being harassed or anything of the sort (or honestly just in general), then you don‚Äôt belong in highly competitive games (such as Siege) and this goes for BOTH women and men. 
---
Moral of the story, don‚Äôt be a little bitch and man the fuck up. Learn how to take an insult and get thicker skin, or leave and go back to playing casual safe space games.
---
Why does it have to be one or the other?
---
Toxicity is a big problem in gaming but so is sexism. They are both issues that we could all do without.
---
I don‚Äôt think claymores are fixed yet ;(
---
Yeah very fun and a good person to have on the team
---
Somebody wants to become Thanos
---
Idk where these bullys are... I play Plat and never had this problem even with random girls in my or enemy team. I dont say it doesnt happen but Ive never seen it with my own eyes.
---
Also nice white knighting OP
---
I don't think there's really one specific source piled up with information. There's a lot to learn for every site and map and that knowledge can only come from experience. As a general rule though, try to focus on where the attackers are most likely to come from and expend your utility to defend that area. For reinforcements, never reinforce between the two bombsites and (almost) always reinforce walls facing outwards.
---
Of a digital version is available I would love to read it.
---
I know, I was just wondering why OP said that. I don‚Äôt think he knows what Outbreak was.
---
They did stop deleting most of them tho. As long as theyre good, they leave them hanging for a while.
---
Would've preferred a classic campaign game...
---
Oh Ian... Never change
---
Excuses? What? To solve the problem u need to identify it correctly, and that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm trying to do.
---
buddy ive been playing R6 since we could use go codes so I understand
---
i have read the patch notes addendum . They will release them and the new ops still get temp gadgets

Sometimes I wonder the same about some posts on here, but then I realise people might just like the social aspect of posting to a subreddit as opposed to just googling it..

Cyberpunk is April 2020...

I don't understand why a game is allowed to launch the first round without a full team.

If someone leaves during the first countdown or someone doesn't make it in the game should be aborted.

It's just another testament to how bad Rs6 matchmaking is..

Then go play old Rainbow Six, its still there.

Ash always seems to go mach 4 and kill before I can even react.

A whole series of these would be sick sub flairs

Depends if you can get info on where the enemy team is, like if you get a good spot to check cams without getting caught then sneaking behind them.

well, im sorry that you cant play. our new tournaments may be on a different day so you might be able to compete then. please keep an eye out for new tournament announcements in this reddit

Shields are currently disabled due to a gamebreaking glitch. 
---
Always take the shotgun secondary and the vector. C4 is also essential for some maps where you play Mira
---
So an infection breaks out, Rainbow just goes on vacation?? They arent dispatched to do anything with all their knowledge, expertise, etc??? You also know nothing of the game, cant say anything is fucked up till they show gameplay, at the earliest... and not even then. Finished product, then you can say it.

You get the charm from watching the Vegas minor this past weekend
---
U had to watch the Vegas minor for 19h to get it. Ur kinda late
---
It's a progressive trigger, meaning that you pull it halfway to fire semi and all the way to fire in automatic. 
---
Its weird to get used to and irl in high stress situations it's easy to accidentally fire in bursts and waste ammunition
---
I took those guns, figuered they were the best. Had no idea about the shield tho. Was 100% i was messing something up
---
Thanks man!
---
I know that feeling, I did a few ranked games at the beginning of Burnt Horizon (Just for the achievement) and got really lucky with my teams and got carried into Gold 2. That was three months and 200 hours ago and people still bring up my 0.2 K/D when I'm going ham and getting 13 kills in a game.

Yesterday i managed the exact same, then ran into a pingabusing clan. Leader had 35 ms, the rest was over 250 and were able to shoot you without sight, or you headshot them 3 times but it just not recognized it. (Blood on my client but not ob theirs)

Which platform? It happened to me recently too even when i was connected to xbox live and i restarted my console and it helped

IQ's weapon is not Aug a1
---
[I've made this suggestion for several years now as comments on existing Caveira interrogation posts before deciding to make this standalone post.  I started with the basic premise of the disconnected avatar staying in the game.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/54xg82/caviera_players_leaving_midinterrogation/d85rw82?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)  In that time, I've received many critical comments about issues people feel my proposed system would cause.  Thus, experience in this exact discussion has taught me that I need to be more explicit and consider a number of different flaws people think my system has otherwise.  In my opinion it isn't a difficult concept to grasp, but for whatever reason that understanding with minimal explanation has not been a universal concept.
---
Yep.
---
They're patching it during mid season reinforcements.
---
The Navy always said ‚ÄúFuck the opposition‚Äù but this is a little too far.
---
I mean idk about others peoples opinions but for me i went from silver 2 to gold 1 to plat 1 within 2 seasons well technically 3 since i started my first ranked experience 2 weeks before the new season and i avoided most peoples struggles of getting out of gold even while solo queuing because as soon as i was high enough in level i put myself in ranked and just went for it and yeah the first few weeks or month sucks with teamates yelling at you and sucking but a good amount of people showed me pointers the dos and the donts and also playing casual doesnt prepare you well for strats people use defending certain places in maps. Not to mention lots of maps on casual arent in ranked so youre learning maps that you dont want to learn if you really want to play ranked and like having to see how high of a standard you can play up to. Also pro tip dont make friends until at least plat because i had too many friends i added that i didnt know wether they were in plat, gold, or silver that keep trying to invite me because im a higher ranked and want to be carried but this is just my experience as a player whos fairly new and been playing for a few months but best of luck man have fun in this interesting community

Some people were saying in the other thread that the initial TTS patch was 3GB so they're guessing that the live update's around the same size.
---
Alt+f4
---
Makes me hungry for pancakes
---
It's on tts. They addressed it. They are experimenting with builds, so we might see old tricks back for a while. It most probably won't be coming to live.
---
Nice! I beat it yesterday, had to try for an hour because of awful teammates. Ended up switching to Monty and defused the last bomb... swarmed by 10 terrorists and with 5 health left, I melee‚Äôd the one destroying the defuser. 100% luck on that one. Felt so good about it I turned around and got another achievement I‚Äôve wanted for a long time: solo T-hunt on Realistic. Felt good
---
And they said later on (in the addendum) that they didn't manage to fix the dropshotting before release date so we'll get it on live for a while until they've fixed it.
---
Even that's too long . This should be hot fixed asap .
---
Because they're doing it when their employees are at work(they're in Montreal) to make sure everything goes as smoothly as possble.
---
Outbreak was cool but shouldn't be a main focus of rainbow 6. It should've just been a side story about the Russians space program and rainbow came in to help clean up. But the game really should be about terrorism and tactical operations.
---
Except that that it isn‚Äôt the base of the meme?

Looks perfect

No literally I clutched a 1v4 and my teammates were still trying to vote kick me. I wasn‚Äôt even talking and I‚Äôm not that new. I play more now. Luckily enough, my friend was there to make sure I didn‚Äôt get all votes yes, and he‚Äôs voted no.

I'm very disappointed to see no patch notes about the console aim acceleration change that was announced 2 seasons ago. It was aimed to be released Y4S2 but unfortunately nothing yet..

It would be awesome to get a dev update about it!

Each scope would have it's own combination of housing size, FOV, viewable scope size, magnification(s), and reticles. Model them off their real counterparts and let player preference do the rest.

It has regular Acog in CSGO.

To be honest, I main cav and it's better, I rarely need the full charge and having the option to switch on and off at will is pretty dope. (I played on the TS)

Often more complex design, longer mechanism for the trigger, spent casings ejecting further back (fun in narrow areas or if you're a left handed shooter) or straight down  (fun if you shoot from a prone position or in ditches / foxholes) and higher manufacturing costs

They should have Jaegar walk on screen, do a few things to it, and then say, "You can stop worrying about mechanical issues now," and walk off with Mozzie visually estatic and Gridlock stunned.
---
THAT would be a satisfying end.
---
I like your name AK47SUKI
---
nokk
---
I want the C4 and impacts as it allows me to deny plant on Bank basement and impact trick the hatch on Clubhouse basement. I have no use of the barbed wire and I agree with the change seeing as so many other operators have the option to take Barbed wire (Smoke and Jager being the obvious two)
---
Sledge.
---
You just have to swap the SATA cables. Nothing else. No need to mess with the schools computer drives. Although that is with internal SATA HDD.
---
As for external HDD I think it requires that you edit the BIOS boot order and set it to the external HDD, never tried it so I can't be sure about it.
---
Jackal
---
I'd like to see the amount of fucks they give for Elas mine too hahaha
---
I hate it and i dont bother to explain.
---
When I do play Kaid and Nomad I never swap to it and I don‚Äôt think I do that with any other operators
---
I usually ace and then ask for them to vote me again. Almost never happens though...
---
Definitely Y1S1...
---
That counts as a pistol
---
Yeah, i do that too, but I don't want to play an operator if I've only got a primary weapon, y'know?
---
Talking about Casual MMR, is it getting reset every season? I'm curious, for I started playing in White Noise, being a complete scrub, and since then my skills have much improved, but it took a long time and I feel like my MMR is improving so slowly I have to play with the kind of people I played since the beginning. And yes, it often grants me stats like 8-1-2, but the skill level applies to both enemies and teammates. Any details on Casual MMR?
---
()_() Discombobulated
---
It was after he got his first kill. He was playing fuze with shield. Go find it in the replay somewhere im too lazy
---
Having C4 plant denial on sites like Bank basement is far more important for Kaid in any ESL setting or organised team.
---
Impact tricking on Clubhouse also makes the impacts worthwhile.
---
No use for barbed wire when other ops can take it for the Kaid.
---
How is this all the game‚Äôs fault? You melee an obj window on one of the most aggressive defender maps in the game. Any 3 speed with 9 ping would have done that to you. Not trying to be an asshole but cmonbruh
---
Times are posted on r6 twitter and pinned at the top of this subreddit.
---
Complicated internals, reloading takes linger,awkward balance so recoil may be harder to manage, debatably worse at range due to being shorter, cartridges are ejected right next to your face, malfunction means that happens right at your face.
---
Oh sugar, don‚Äôt just mail it; get an easy-peasy online publishing agent for a small fee to get it to the right people at Ubisoft. It looks outstanding, and I‚Äôm a huge fan of the OG lore. Hey maybe they‚Äôll have a baked-in editor for you. Best of luck!!

A machine pistol at that.

Pretty sure they do this every time.

I don't really get it, but I got annoyed enough into sitting down on a long weekend and just banging it out.
---
will the claymores back when this update come  ?
---
If you do even a little Google search you would've known that the Beryl is another AK variant, of course it looks like an AK.
---
Controller and i believe he has PC recoils on top of that. (Consoles have smaller recoil?)
---
Office on skyscraper. Triple wall leads to the balcony outside. Reinforce all of them and then shock the two right most.
---
The typical peak on this angle is done with a valk cam. Run out at the start, and plant barbed wire in the middle of the two shocked walls.
---
In order to breach they need to thatcher and not have kaid pick it up or destroy the barbed wire using gadgets or punch it.
---
You can see the glow of thatcher needs so you pick the shock up and replant it.
---
If they start punching or walk through you have time to run out and shoot knowing full well they are in the wire.
---
Bank vault, reinforce near the window both walls, barbed wire on the other side.  When placed right shocks people dropping from hatch and has two walls shocked.
---
Leaving you free to shock elevator shaft or corridor above mira window.
---
Again thanks to thatcher glow you can pick your shock up from the objective room preventing them ever breaching that corner.
---
You were about 4 seaaons to early

Congrats!
---
isn't the AUG scope like 1x or 1.5x?
---
that puts it more in the magnification range of standard scopes than an ACOG.
---
\*Introduction\*
---
D'assaut is a fourth shield-using GIGN operator joining the rainbow team on the Operation Extension.
---
She uses a Assault Shield what she likes to call 'Boudier de D'assaut'.
---
It is incredibly lightweight, making her the fastest Shield Operator yet.
---
Her ability is to run while having the shield covering her front side of the body.
---
The ability recharges like Caveira or Vigil.
---
But unlike them, She needs to fully recharge for another use.
---
When she uses her ability, She can run for 7 seconds in speed of light-armored operators.
---
When the enemy gets hit by a charge, the enemy gets 7 HP off, and loses their ability to aim for 1 second.
---
She can't hipfire her pistol whether using a ability or not, she can only aim with her pistol.
---
To catch your fiends, use original standard issue GIGN P9 pistol, or use their latest adopted P250C pistol.
---
Ahh thank you! I really appreciate it! I thoroughly enjoy making Cosplays. But I absolutely love recreating the gun skins from R6.  It's also so much fun to Cosplay, I highly recommend itüòÅüòÅ
---
To strong with movement.  Smoke, get droned out, turn on gadget, run around smoke killing people.
---
Now, smoke, get droned out, decide can you kill them when they enter or are you going to reposition lose visual for a few moments and hope they don't push then.
---
Still a very strong gadget.
---
Ack-Ay-Yu-Gee? Doesn't roll of the tongue well
---
Being able to electrify two walls and block the drone hole next to them is pretty potent and makes it harder to clear.  Especially when he only has two gadgets to deploy.
---
I agree that Nitro is one of the best secondary gadgets, but he's not the type of operator to get in range to use it.
---
also having so many ranked modes would split the playerbase
---
it might be a pos in real life, but in-game it would be a great scope (thanks to how R6 implements scopes)
---
that said though, a 1.5x scope wouldn't get ACOG magnification in game anyway.
---
Ok first of all. Username checks out. Second of all, massive testicles for doing this in ranked. Lol
---
Read the sticky
---
Welp I'm a lefty.
---
That‚Äôs dumb that it got removed everyone rants. I had a game last night where my whole team threw and I carried and the last round in OT they purposely died and then text chatted my location
---
Been around since first dlc.
---
 Don‚Äôt send fanfic to publishers, they legally can‚Äôt open it or even look at it because if you happen to have guess what they‚Äôre planning, it means you can sue them and they would have to scrap the entire creative project
---
No... itll be about 1pm ET
---
Just telling you what he tweeted man
---
Running should stop the auto reload until you stop running.
---
When did IQ pop out of the monitor
---
Like..what day??
---
Thanks
---
You get that i'm talking about Phantom Sight's charms, right..?
---
It also places the chamber right next to your face. Should a catastrophic failure occur, your face is right next to the part of the gun responsible for containing a small explosion. Look at [this pic of an M14 that kb'd.](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f1/c0/7b/f1c07b0f5e515e41efe4d2d4da2fb39c.jpg) Notice that the worst of the damage happened at the chamber and the stock is pretty much fine. I'm sure the shooter who was unfortunate enough to be firing this was probably hurt but it would've been a lot worse had his face been next to the area of failure.
---
The auto reload only happens when you try to fire your weapon when you have zero bullets left. Blackbeard is the only op that doesnt have that feature.
---
Honestly I hate the constant banning of blitz. I'm not a blitz main (I'm more toxic cause who doesn't love a good old blackbeard main) but while hes a strong choice to pick if you have mo other options first priority on a lot of maps should ether be banning thermite hibana or mavrick or Thatcher to cut down on hard breathing. 
---
Then same goes for echo. Echo and maestro are strong choices too if you have no one else to worry about. Me and my friends were on Oregon and I told them ban mira shes worse then echo on Oregon but they still banned him and we got destroyed by a mira.
---
Some higher priority bans for outside of banning those 3 and montagne and this is based on the map in general so
---
Hard breachers and thatcher (if map has outer walls leading to room ban thermite. If it has walls that can create dangerous angles but needa be rienforce go for hibana or mavrick. If map is hatch oriented like organ then go for Thatcher or hibana)
---
Soft breachers (this may seem like a bad idea but banning ops like ash buck zofia and sledge on maps that have lots of angles for ops to come from like villa, heavy vertical play like Oregon or both like thempark can prove to be extremely helpful to you in the end. Each map is like the hard breachers and if you learn them you start learning who excels on what maps but for a quick overview on the 3 I named. Zofia would be the soft breacher for organ cause of laundry stairs she can peak down and with claymore she can gaurd her back on her own. Ash on villa cause you dont qant ger destroying a wall you missed cause of lack of rienforcments. Lastly sledge or buck on thempark cause on rooms like drug lab they can do very dangerous vertical play then on rooms like daycare they have plenty of angles to push using their gadgets)
---
Mira (rooms like Oregon laundry and storage are stuff you need to consider cause shes strong in rooms like that)
---
Mute bandit and kaid (in general good idea to try to ban one If the map is hard breacher oriented for attack like border)
---
*French noises
---
That‚Äôs pretty situational and quite frankly kinda useless. Plus I‚Äôd rather not have tons of shields in the game
---
Ay it's me! üòÇ
---
So just have a local copy of the OS on the backup drive and clone it. Most school or even office PC's run the same hardware, so just cloning the HDD is not going to be a problem and regular backups must be mandatory for work data anyway.
---
What I read must have been incorrect then. Thanks for the info
---
Great for Rush. She does not take penalty of the barbed wire on her ability.
---
&gt;accomplished something

If you were carried then no you didn‚Äôt...

Only noobs have to spawnpeek
---
For sure. Whats your name. Ill add you
---
She still makes no noise when running, it's hus lt the cam thing and you should know how to make good use of her gadget anyways.
---
the maintenance starts at 14
---
If you want to.
---
The barbed wire doesnt break?
---
Anyone that says spawnpeek are unfair are the people that aren‚Äôt prepared to check for them lol, if you know any really popular spots on maps (for example when you run out main entrance on plane), then go for it
---
Thots
---
It's sad to think about how much money those guys must've spent getting name brand guns/optics/attachments in that game just for it to flop so hard.
---
What I told you so?
---
Today
---
people who say spawn peeks aren't fair a probably copper or just don't understand how to counter it
---
Alright thank you :)
---
ZOMBIE DRONES!
---
This deserves an up vote for sure
---
False. Ubi fixes *unfair* spawnpeeks where you're literally seeing into their spawn or something crazy where they can't move 3 feet. They don't fix fair spawnpeeks that can be avoided by a tiny spec of awareness.
---
They made a failsafe that resets an operator to default position if a set of steps are carried out to try and glitch using the gadgets. There is further changes to this coming during the season but for now the issue should be resolved..
---
That I can't be sure of. What I do know, is that at E3 they are confirming brand new games to come out on the Xbox in 2020. Like Cyber Punk 2077. So I doubt the current consoles are going to lose player bases for a very long time. Same thing with 360.
---

I wish they had kept this background. Static backgrounds don't take away GPU performance.

Lads and Gentlelads,
---
This is beauty
---
It‚Äôs not an educated guess when they literally said 3 weeks after the test server it will be released on the live servers. And when this started you could clearly find that information and a lot of other signs leading to believe this.
---
Oh i thought it would be clear as sarcasm
---
Welcome to the game! Don't give up, and sorry in advance for the toxic members of the community.
---
I love this game and I play with 2 buddies a lot in casual. I have bought the game for many of friends who we would take and roll a group of 4 and that toxic person that would dare kick our newbie would get kicked themselves. 
---
It is sad how often we have done that since it is casual, play and have fun. Most the time we goof off in casual anyways. Seeing someone vote me out is funny because it makes sense, I‚Äôd kick me half the time but someone who is genuinely learning the game, don‚Äôt be that douche.
---
Yeah, I wish he did though
---
Hello xPiranha, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bzcv2x/is_ranked_finally_out_of_beta/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
A man of culture

Well that's a load of shit, first game with them enabled and there's a jagger doing shield glitch and a clash being clash
---
You will have it forever
---
It's peak Rainbow Six Siege that in a Ranked overtime match, it's 3 vs 5.
---
Back in my day there were no discounts on ops and you had to pay 5‚Ç¨ or 25K renown for them.
---
Firstly, I have run four different distros on my school laptop, manjaro, openSUSE tumbleweed, KDE neon and kubuntu, all of these ran perfectly out of the box with no need to configure drivers.
---
Secondly, if it were based on Linux (which it is likely not) you should be able to simply run a script to install all necessary programs.
---
Finally, if it were windows, there are specific tools you can use to clone one installation to another and configuring drivers and so fourth is done for you.
---
the best thing is back
---
Im actually in class right now. Funny how people have this fantasy that anyone who bullies them lives a fucking terrible life. Sorry bud, youre the fucking loser. Youre the fucking neckbeard that post this shit trying to get upvotes. Stop acting like the people that put you down are going to turn out poor and die alone, we are going to turn out just fine because we arent fucking losers who think its homophobic to call a faggit a faggit.
---
Once you subscribe you get the charm within a short period of time, you will NOT lose access to the charm if you do not resub.
---
do i need to send you links? have you not played ela? if you played ela even occasionally for the past year, you‚Äôd notice her recoil before grim sky and after wind bastion. completely different. if you follow any siege youtuber during that time, they were going crazy for the ela recoil buff
---
Kaid is a somewhat special case since he says his line when the rtila actually activates, unlike most characters who say it while throwing their gadgets.
---

article 5 has been here since release of siege . What are you talking about ?

Not having dropshotting and the whole claymore/shield thing fixed for launch is crap.  Not going to play much until those are fixed.

Where are the new situations?

Thanks for the reply
---
I know it's a bit picky, and if it's too much work for you, no problem, but do you think you could make an epub or something we can put on a kindle/e-reader?
---
You could sub for the charm then get a refund
---
Situations are old.
---
Servers are down. Says approx 57 minutes to be up again. Is this it?

Oh damn new situations?!

Thats up to you then. Correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't you able to transfer your 360 account to the Xbox One?
---
Damn F
---
Sorry, my mistake
---
&gt; the gadgets. There is further changes to this coming during the season but for now the issue should be resolved..
---
Can the Jager shoot? Does he put the shield down after a few seconds?

I know it works but what are the chances of me randomly throwing and EMP and killing someone
---
So it‚Äôs 10:04 right now for so 12

This. Imaging solutions have been around for decades, and most are free. Especially if the school has an Enterprise agreement with Microsoft. (Hint: They Do, because Microsoft hands these out to education sector like candy at a deeply discounted rate)

Only thing that makes this more than a slight annoyance is laziness or incompetence.

Ironic how you call me a kid when you have a mental age of 12. And if you think this is bullying in any way that's kinda jokes. Also get a dictionary for a Christmas present and concentrate on your lesson as ur gonna need all these qualifications to clean my toilet when you are older.

What the heck?
---
I‚Äôm confused is this an event or a whole new game?

Wire is good in any situation tho. It slows down a push and gives an audio queue making it good for flank watch. Now c4 is definitely a great gadget to have but its just not good for everybody
---
You submitted the whole thing in English you sick fuck

What's new, REALLY looking forward to this bomb only, 3 round rotate, reused guns, recycled ability, ugly lesion elite and smoke elite, drop shorting season. Woohoo
---
N√∏kk use the FMG-9 with Holographic sight and flash hider, with suppressed D-50. I can't remember what her gadgets are but bring claymore if she has it. When moving around the maps, move in bursts. Wait until your ability recharges before moving again. Never sprint unless it's almost the end of the round and you need to get to OBJ quick.
---
Warden I use the MPX with Holographic and compensator and the P-10 pistol without attachments. Warden is definitely an anchor.
---
Yeah I know that but I meant if you already used your twitch prime and just want the charm
---
everybody in the community knows this, everyone has played bandit atleast once with no sight attachment
---
If your killstreak depends on spawnpeek not on actual skill then it is
---
Can someone confirm?

It‚Äôs worse than CS:GO used to be. I feel like every round people mad rush only to die instantly then try to vote kick those still alive.

I play ranked most of the time so right near a new season the ranked playlist around gold to plat gets flooded with smurfs and becomes super toxic.
---
Don't get Ela. Yes i main her and I'm saying this. 
---
She's the worst roamer in game, and just in general one of give worst operators in all. 
---
To begin let's talk of her scorpion. First it's damage is pathetic,  23 at base damage and after fall off range it drops to 15 which like i said is pretty pathetic. Second her recoil for that gun is pretty bad. Vertically it's okay, but horizontally it's like Ela had her gun chambered in .50 cal and got rid of her stock and became six years old. To put it simple horizontally the recoil is random, I've tested it. 
---
Her shotgun is the best in game but range is a no go.
---
Her pistol is underpar and is actually the lowest damaging in game. Its fall off range is actually bad as well.
---
Her secondary gadgets are useless to her as barbed wire and a shield mean nothing to a roamer. And her mines are just lackluster at best. They aren't lethal, they're easy to see, aren't plentiful, only last 5 seconds or 10 if you waste 2 on someone. They really only are effective in the end of games but most time when they go off it'll be the beginning of a round.
---
My main gripe is that every defender usually is given a shotgun and smg/carbine. Ela is given these but with her lack of any good ranged weapon is only allowed to engage at close ranges while every one else on her team can pick both long or close. So not only is she outgunned by the attacker but even her own team which is just sad.
---
Not to mention her 6 public nerfs and 0 buffs on her back and likely more nerfs to come.
---
She has flash and breach charge.
---
Thank you for the tips!
---
(¬†Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Yeah I‚Äôm level 180 and all my buddies are only 40s. It can be extremely draining telling 3 other people how to set up their defenses in the prep phase every time. Im just hoping the pay off is worth it when they finally figure it out because I hate solo queuing.
---
I saw someone do that while in our computer science class a while back
---
It's a new change
---
it wasnt green before this season
---
would be ok if it was sideways?
---
Well should have got the game back when it came out like the rest of us, smh
---
No Lesion √©lite üòî
---
Fr barb is underappreciated in this game. Its like having 2 non lethal lesion mines
---
No problem! Bring breach charge because I don't think flash goes well with her ability but as you start playing her getting used to it then use what works best
---
What would your reaction be if they actually published this?
---
Indeed it should.
---
Just got the game - not new to this sort of gameplay - OMG - I'm already sick of all these 12 year olds whinning and using racial slurs every other word, wtf

Overwatch, Sims, Spiderman, monster hunter world, sea of thieves, star wars battlefront two, no man's sky, ark:SE, destiny 2. Play those not an m rated game

Especially when apparently, no one on your team knows how to reinforce.
---
Nah, age limits are for a reason
---
Here‚Äôs an idea. How about we all wait till they release info on the game? We know it‚Äôs PvE, we know it‚Äôs 1-3 people online, and we know all rainbow 6 operators will be part of the game in some way, or at least that‚Äôs how I interpreted what that lady said in her interview. But that‚Äôs all we know. Wanna know how much it bothers me that vigil is in the game? It doesn‚Äôt because he‚Äôs still an R6 operative which means he can shoot a gun. The game comes out in a year so why can we all just relax a bit.
---
Or maybe we'll get a Danish defender and a secret service attacker next season which would be a odd way of doing it
---
Bug
---
Yeah,  her face is too wide and her eyes are too set in. And the fate of siehe and ubi themselves will be themselves.. it took them 4 years to address sound issues in siege, still have attempted to fix hit reg and fail everytime. The games graphics look like a ps2 shooter. Like God sake bfv looks like your cgi trailers yet that's in game and with better shading. And a major problem with ubi is then only listening to the proleague and the baised cunts who never complain. And only taking data from pc the 25% of the community,  and a very small portion of the pc players in only being plat and diamond so about 25% of the 25%. Which is just fucking stupid if you ask me.

Massively, I just recently got back into the game I left after around year 2 DLC with Frost, Buck, Valk etc.  Jump into a match and have had to completely relearn all the maps again and the bomb/hostage sites etc!!!  
---
I think they‚Äôve reworked the maps to be too big, but that might just because I haven‚Äôt learnt all the sightlines etc.  Either that or make the time a little longer idk.

Good on you my dude. I've been staring at a finished original manuscript for years. Never seems to be done...
---
Incorrecrt sea of thieves has guns and we cant put that on our helpless children. Monster hunter world has swords, sharp things can cut children so thats not good, same gun thing with overwatch and star wars. Not sure about no mans sky you can die of oxygen lose i think cause its a space game and death is a no no for children, ark has sharp things as well, and destiny has guns smh

You definitely get an email after every season with this info and more.

Can we stop this? Since when is rainbow six a horror series? Stop with the fucking zombies already. What‚Äôs next battle royale? They‚Äôre proving that they are completely out of ideas and we are letting them get away with it!

Didn't say the opposite.

For me it is saying there is a maintenance break.

Thx for that

Bro I'm level 181 and have all ops legit. So you've had enough just spent it on dumb cosmetics
---
same shit on pc, my gpu is going crazy in main menu
---
Holy shit dude I would be scared as fuck that it would be explode is it only for that game? And even if you clean it there‚Äôs no reason it should jump that high is it disk or digital?
---
I'm allowed to hate the setting of the game, regardless of whether or not I've seen the finished product. I never judged its mechanical quality, just the settint. I think they've fucked Rainbow up by throwing alien zombies into a series about an elite group oounter-terrorists waging basically a silent war against terrorism and I don't need gameplay to think that.
---
No, they aren't. That's literally what the military is for. RAINBOW is a counter-terrorist team. Not special forces.
---
i literally just played it.
---
Monty, Sledge and Gridlock are my anime waifus

---
For the semi casual player, how would they even know this exists? For someone with a potato PC, how should they open this up and take a look at stats while in game? Etc. etc. etc. 
---
If there‚Äôs a stats website that tracks and works, fine. But integration and official branding and tracking is always preferred. 
---
The fact you have to go to a third party website to look at anything rather than just having access to your stats in the game is pretty asinine to me, and the solution of ‚Äòjust go to this other random website‚Äô seems incredibly lazy. That‚Äôs me though.
---
It‚Äôs just getting started
---
I kinda wanna do this cause my school blocks everything. I mean you literally can't look up "toilet."
---
Well she only has one of the gadgets temporarily until claymores are fixed completely, just like warden doesn't have a shield rn

I hate solving IR issues. Simply restarting PC fixes 90% of them. Many thanks for your help though. Hf in game.

What happened?

You nailed it! It‚Äôs looks like she just received bukkake from a hunting party of Predators. Great work!
---
Also If You Got The Time, Which Is The Best Lurking Attacker?
---
Same happened to me
---
I was just about to post the same thing happening to me.
---
Nook I guess. Attacker and defender guns are balanced completely differently. The only reason I say Nook is because she is an attacker with a defender weapon

Siege had the setting. It didn't stray too far away. But do you belive Clancy would have ever written a zombie novel?

That's a bug. Calm down.

Are we still getting phantom sight or is it just the skin. And are we getting claymores back.

No because recycled guns is retarded.

I¬¥m sorry, I didn¬¥t. It happened to me during a Thunt, I went in for another to get the screenshot. I opened the door, the debris was stuck, I knifed the terrorist and waited long enough for the notification to disappear. I also have screenshots of debris stuck on the new Kafe map
---
Yea correct. Doesnt matter though as A3 and A2 are very much the same thing. But the abomination called A1 is terrible.
---
Gno.
---
Yea I've seen it bug out a couple times but I like the idea of how the sound works.
---
Remove the edit or i will sneak into your house and put suppressors on all of your guns.

That's been happening fo a few seasons now. Ubisoft is incapable with f fixing it. You have to restart your app.

[Plat charm](https://imgur.com/3ABfKPi) btw. Look like old diamond after they changed the color.

Correct. Admittedly things get a bit... crazy in the opening chapters, since it was originally intended to be a short story, but I reined things back in and smoothed over the rough edges. 
---
That would only make sense if you read the entire thing, I suppose.
---
Can they please, sneak in an fov slider or something on console, idc about performance issues, it won‚Äôt even change that much, but 60 hurts my eyes. That‚Äôs all I ask for in the next update
---
They said they wanted to change the debris constantly getting stuck when knifing it during the Pro League Season Reveal Panel. It doesn¬¥t seem to work \^\^

Don't complain he's the best character

The new  op can see through smoke just like glass but he's a defender so now there's a new rivalry ig ü§£

People keep telling me I have a good narration voice but I really, really don‚Äôt think I do. Haha!
---
I had some taken away on Xbox that I hadn't gotten yet.
---
Warden's ability let's him see through smoke, and glaz can see through smoke with his scope (while standing still as of today's patch)
---
Does anybody know if Clash, frags, and deployable shields are back?
---
Because people use the ban system to remove people they struggle against, not actually to help the teams.
---
PLEASE BAN MIRA EVERY FUCKING GAME
---
Unplug your xbone &amp; plug it back in. Worked for me.
---
I wish i had a dollar for everytime a guy asked me for toe pics, gamer girl piss, or my Instagram. I know theyre joking but ita atill obnoxious. All the guys who act toxic and say shit like that in chat really need to realize that i dont think its funny after hearing it from so many other gamers. News flash bud: you arent the first person to jokingly ask me dumb shit like that. Thats why im annoyed.
---
Maybe there‚Äôs a super computer/ AI gone evil like the resident evil movies and there‚Äôs lasers and sentry guns and shit which makes vigil and Nokk the only ones that can sneak by them
---
I‚Äôm sorry.

You hear the reload clearly? Also I don't have to cover my teammates then
---
Honestly yeah.

uhh this sometimes happens on ps4 I just play a cas and after the match it‚Äôs fixed
---
I kinda wish that quarantine would be a type of addon to siege. Even If it isnt, I hope that they add characters from quarantine to siege aswell, either way the game looked dope, let's hope its $20 like siege
---
A season or two ago there was a bug where your audio would completely reverse like you out your headset on backwards
---
I can't play it on Nvidia Shield. It just says patching.
---
Does anyone have the same problem on shield
---
RIP.
---
I've only come close to that by mistakes, but never had it happen. 
---
But if I ever do download large update files or such, I take the time to focus back on games I've neglected. 
---
Collecting the last few trophies from BioShock is my current "something to do while I wait for the update file to download" project, and it's not bad at all.
---
I kind of agree but at least it will force players to develop their skills for their weaker rounds
---
It feels a little slower but I'm not sure
---
My friend! I didn‚Äôt know you‚Äôre a mod here!?
---
You will get all Operators from Y4, some r6 credits and an exclusive skin I think
---
Yeah most developers don't, it's evident from lack of severs and no regional pricing.
---
I don't blame them that much though, most Indians would prefer to play mobile pubg than game on pc.

So uh... u/SAU-SIEGE, is this happening?
---
Honestly I've started leaving them camped above doorways so the sound keeps people at bay a bit.
---
LOL I keep switching to ops with barbed wire &amp; they take it away every single time. This game is out to get me, I just started maining Kaid. Like I just started playing again after not having fun Year 3 &amp; this.
---
That is his major downside. The downside that make Lord a meme OP.
---
Oh boy. I cant wait to get my copper one.
---
If the fungus ants were bigger news than ebola at the time... probably.
---
It's good to see another buck/doc main
---
Mira is a great choice. She can change a defense setup completely that shuts off many avenues of attack... And there in lies the problem. She's too good on a lot of maps so for the maps you actually want to play her she will be banned due to the new ranked system. However, this does come with its own perks. It'll force Mira players to make new setups on maps she's not "historically" known for being amazing on. The meta will shift and that's a good thing.
---
I hope you have fun with her, she's very satisfying to play personally.
---
Sorry, I ment all operators that have one other than ash. I'm not discrediting your work btw it's amazing
---
When will the new streamer charms be released?
---
No one is wrong per say. Get flanked was wrong for calling it a issue when it's how the camera angle was designed. The issue is imo that bullets come from your head and not your gun. It creates unrealistic positions for head glitches.
---
Well your tactic is a semi typical one of people who used to play ela, because she used to have impacts so setting up a mine and waiting was super easy, now it can be a little harder. I think that generally speaking ela is no longer a "great" roamer. People get mad that a 3 speed op isnt a roamer but it's okay not to be, but getting back to your setup, it can work in comp, but you need to have good aim. If the mine gets tripped you have to act, and if you realize you are outnumbered and flee then you have wasted utility. As well, if they don't come to you it makes taking back certain objectives very difficult, that's why I tend to hover around the objective, because it allows you to try and control the engagement angles. So this isnt to say your strategy is bad, but the higher you get, the less it may work, and you will find that your success completely depends on YOU getting a kill, not helping your team win the round, which, if you lack a team group or a mic can sometimes be the best you have, but keep in mind that in comp, the objective truly is to win, not just have a good kd. 
---
If you enjoy your current style this would be my suggestion:
---
Throw one mine down in obj opposite the direction you plan to roam, next go to a choke point and throw the mine down where you usually would, hold the other. Should someone trip the mine in your area, get the kill, or at least cause some panic. Best advise for this is to try gauge their direction, and figure out if you can attack perpendicular to where they may be looking. Now if the mine near objective is tripped, fall back immediately to help the anchors, and it could be helpful to try and throw your remaining mine behind the enemy as this makes it harder to retreat. I'd say though that if say a minute passes and no one has come to your trap spot, pick up your mine if you have time, rethrow it somewhere on your path back to obj, and try to flank the enemy position and push them into one of your mines, either using the remaining mine to create a place to do this, or keep it so if they focus on you, you can throw it and run, though a possible tactic with ela, is to fake that you are running away completely and just pick a corner to wait and see if they follow then pounce on them. Just remember since elas strength is close up, you have to force close up, and your enemy will try to force distance, so try and maneuver to where you catch them trying to create that distance and are moving around. 
---
Another thing to consider, since I for one play this way, is be very careful of attackers with shotguns. You won't see it very often since people think it's a bad idea, but the attacker shotguns are pretty good (as most are on defense as well) and most are pumps, so they will most likely kill you before you can kill them if they are a good shot, so if you recognize that they have one, you need to be smart, and try to time the reloads, but just be careful of getting decked by an aggressive shotgun attacker. 
---
Side note: Ela has a mine that she deploys when she goes down, if you are near enemies, spam the shit out of the button to activate it so they get hit. If you are not near enemies but they are probably coming for you, wait a sec and try to get them with it or time it to a teammates rotation so you can help the refrag.
---

---
No bc I like the way run outs are now bc it's easy to kill them after they get spotted and when u get high in levels u start learning how to counter them.
---
It‚Äôs on live servers, on console and pc. And it is still very easy to aim and prone on console, whether it is a modded controller or with claw or even just moving the finger a little bit, it‚Äôs still common.
---
only resolution you can get in borderless is 1280x720
---
I mean, idk about others but I sure as hell don't stay outside for nearly 15 seconds
---
Oh, I think I found the problem. Season 2 Year 2 was Operation Health were no operators were introduced and Ubisoft counts both Ying/Lesion and one Grom-Operator to Season 3 of Year 2. Kinda stupid from my perspective but okay, at least I understand it now.
---
it did eventually come up so I didn't need to requeue

I can confirm that they changed them, i needed 100 hundred successful t hunts on defence (I was on 70) to get the platinum trophy but they changed it to perimeter secured so I literally just got it a couple minutes ago.

I‚Äôm aware lol
---
She thicccc
---
Im still quite confused by this whole situation and I feel like a dev response would be quite helpful. I feel like flanked is reacting a bit too harsh though, yes CR maybe made some bad comments but it didn‚Äôt sound like he had bad intent when he was talking during the video.
---
Thanks everyone!
---
those thighs, my guy
---
m249 and the Zofia's LMG-E are absolute beasts.
---
IMO it‚Äôs better for the devs to delay rather than release a buggy and/or scuffed cosmetic.
---
I hope the game's story tells us why it looks like this. Maybe someone did try to nuke it and that's the result or there were multiple containment procedures which worsened the situation.
---

---
Haha I try. This is gonna end up being pointless drama, so hopefully ubisoft can see past the drama and look at what might actually help.

then seasons passes and such  would have anything to do with the game

He is. Ross took his video and showed the real world physics and the truth behind perspective. And then he said its not perfect and ubi could change it a bit.

If flanked went on to say that he accepts that what ross is said is true but it doesnt work for a video game, it would have been fine.
---
But NOOOO, he had to go how ross apparently "misunderstood" flanked and spent 9 minutes complaining. 
---
Thats the definition of a salty bitch.
---
As troll-like as it may seem, it's a valid strat for more psychological reasons than practical. Me and my friends plan to do this, mainly because none of us have the Season Pass, and since banning them is no problem for us, we hope to get some of the enemy team, who might have the Season Pass, to ragequit.

1st offense: 30 minute ban. 2nd offense: 2 hour ban 3rd offense: 7 hour ban. 4th offense: 24 hour ban.  It's the same as team killing offenses.  Do you want a leaver permabanned on first offense???

Recoil wise? Sure but she could have had better primary. I run shotgun and works surprisingly well.
---
I can agree with you to an extent. She does desperately need a buff, though not a significant one because we don't want another nightmare operator that's scarier than Cav. I will agree that the damage isn't the best and needs a change. It is a very high firing smg so the recoil makes a bit of sense. For her gadget, maybe take away the shield for a camera so she's more fit for Intel. I will have to say no to impacts for the reason being that she is best used not as a roamer, but what I call a "vulture". Stay near your gadget and watch over a common entry point and snag a kill while they are dazed. It is a bit hard to make her more viable with how chaotic she can be if you play her wisely. Open to other opinions and criticism.

Is the site in question.  Ive been saying it over in my head constantly but "learn the attack basis" just doesnt make sense.  Surely its "Basics" and they missed it.... twice.
---
You could but not as prominent
---
I mean does anyone actually like Kanal? are we going to go through this same shit again when it hits?
---
But yeah it looks great, I haven‚Äôt played in a match yet but I was looking at in custom and you can just see the new strats. I found one room in kitchen particularly funny because it was safe from vertical play but there‚Äôs a small segment of the wall already blown out where they want people to just chuck grenades in to compensate. 
---
Attacking through the second story door looks like a really bad idea now as not only is there going to be a guy with an ACOG posted up behind the couch on balcony ready to take your head off but windows break super clean now make it incredibly easy to fire down on people.
---
A minor detail I noticed is that shooting snow has a splash effect now that looks really cool.
---
Well i've read that it is even on console, just harder to do. But since im not playing on console i cant really confirm it.
---
If u hate getting yelled at mute ur team when u join and just play cas till u get gud. Dont mute teamates when u play ranked tho
---
I don't think it's legal, we can buy the ingame currencies for Apex legends, and many games which have this credits like currency system. I don't know what the issue is here specifically.
---
There is currently a war between the two on Twitter right now, and flanked uploaded a reply stating that his "credibility and knowledge were questioned" (which is not true, and I really like Flanked by the way), and he took down that video immediately (probably realised it was wrong, idk).
---
I want to see how this unfolds. Ross isn't wrong here. And he never made any personal remarks.
---
Nope it's like every other game.
---
But lesion is permabanned in rankeds!
---
I was wondering why this popped up when I loaded it up
---
Crank your volume and master sound
---
Gold 1 and 2 are close enough to plat to have plats in those games in solo q. I don't for a second believe that second scenario. Mostly because you got your thought mixed up and said you had 6 players on your team.
---
Can you buy it for any Ubisoft product?  They could be having licensing issues.
---
All these maps are one sided. With 3 round rotations, they should not be in ranked
---
thiccc
---
while it doesnt make sense to have them matched against lvl 200s, instantly kicking only paints a picture of an extremly toxic community and demotivates them from further playing the game. You actually learn and grow faster against higher level enemies.
---
Ohh.ok.
---
N√∏kk has great weapons, a ridiculous ability, and is fast as fuck. Warden has massive amounts of team synergy. Kits are great, change my mind
---
By not solo queuing for starters.
---
Its happening siege is dying out on PS4. or probably people are playing discovery more.
---
Well I was excited for this season

---
I‚Äôm 18 and it‚Äôs exam season. I rarely have a 5 stack apart from the weekends. If we solo q, the game should auto detect it. It isn‚Äôt fair to have a team of 5 solo q players against a 3 stack and 2 stack on one team. Also, no one on ps4 uses their mic and since I‚Äôm in EU, 3/4 of the people who actually do are French or Spanish. As I‚Äôve stated in a previous post of mine, French teammates are the most toxic I‚Äôve played with. Also, teammates with their mics in with their music on blast or they‚Äôre talking to their mum or they scream when they die which means I can‚Äôt hear shit.
---
Us to ubi: Outstanding move
---
I didnt say they were bad but they could change some things.
---
The fmg 9 is a bullet hose with no recoil. Just headshot, lul.
---
Idk. Basis is pretty similar. As taken from Google,"the underlying support or foundation for an idea, argument, or process."
---
Thats awesome dude!
---
Hopefully they will give it a read and maybe do something with it!
---
Okay. If it is a issue with my client then it's a whole different problem to be dealt with, can you buy the credits ingame and pay through steam wallet? Can your friends but it too ingame?
---
I'm not sure how possible it is for you to play Siege, considering that you need to have fast reactions and that you need to be able to distinguish details. Try playing support operators like a hard breacher or Jager, Bandit, Valkyrie and so on.
---
I‚Äôve tried so much on console (testing purposes) and I can‚Äôt replicate it. Doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs gone but I have no evidence in game to say it is in
---
Yes, its back.
---
Basis is a word and could fit in those sentences.
---
Nokk + MP7
---
Warden needs to be slightly faster? Or make it where the transition is quicker cause hes pretty good my main problem is nokk.
---
No. That's the problem. Didn't know I needed it. Thank's for answering me instead of just downvoting.
---
Yeah man, people are toxic on this game. I still love it somehow tho.
---
Your first mistake was playing in Casual
---
It just  doesnt sound right xD
---
I am comin' for ya
---
So you are a kid in college who can't be bothered to take the game seriously and is whining about the consequences of not having friends who can play the game at the same time. No offense but nobody cares about your edge case and your bitching.
---
It makes a pretty loud sound when you're planting. Lol
---
Because now he has plant denial, hard breach denial and an ACOG, I would actually consider this a buff because it's really not viable to electrocute barbed wire
---
Well, I would say check for driver updates. buttttt......
---
Bullets and echos drone shows vigil style static
---
I play ela too, a lot actually, so I know exactly what you‚Äôre talking about. Her vertical recoil is worse than horizontal recoil and also, it‚Äôs not hard to kill someone with her Scorpion.
---
Shoot her
---
None, as there should be
---
Yea i have bought the credits in game. My friends haven't tried buying credits but they can its unlocked for them too.
---
A bullet.
---
I'd say remove both her current secondary gadgets. A camera would be nice but impacts just give her that bit more of a punch to her bite. But also as another alternative to give her the censor gadget. The one that's been in the files for god knows when. It'd be perfect for her really. But her recoil yeah should be a bit more than everyone else's. Even though Mira has a higher rate of fire gun, with a bigger caliber of bullet being .45 acp against Ela's 9mm which is smaller yet the Vector has no recoil whatsoever but that's beside my point. Her recoil shouldn't be random, it should be consistent on where it goes. Because it is sure as hell not consistent. But we can blame ubi for her release problems, they didn't properly test her nor do they with new operators so really it's their fault.
---
N√∏kk + mp7 would be OP. Warden is already really busted and makes both blitz and ying pointless in the right hands.
---
Bet
---
Reminds me when I was watching a Griefdrums video, and he died in it and he got really mad, I know it's not the same thing but I'm trying to say he doesn't really have his emotions in check. 
---
Video: [https://youtu.be/rqAK-9Ve2mM?t=587](https://youtu.be/rqAK-9Ve2mM?t=587)
---
I have to check for that. I own watch dogs 1 &amp; 2,  and division apart from siege. I'll try in those.
---
Gotta wreck some to win some!
---
Tosic
---
I got one on defense but it seems like something they are doing for new smaller maps cause Hereford and outback both never have bombers on them on classic
---
Excuse, but I don't see it
---
But then again it can mean process so I could be possible
---
Um, that‚Äôs exactly what this is. Ubisoft Montreal were the ones that made Outbreak for Siege, and they are making Quarantine. They aren‚Äôt even in the same country as the R6:Siege team.
---
They consider it a funny, 30 minute long joke
---
 I never said permaban did I buddy? However, on console, people have duplicate accounts so once one is banned they just switch over to their other account and keep playing.
---
They are decently balanced ops who don't need changes.
---
Im not sitting here crying in my room because someone called me a whore for no reason in game. Its not about me not having thick skin. Im not hurt by the comments, its just rude and annoying. There is absolutely no reason for people to talk trash just because of gender. The problem isn't girls being too sensitive. The problem is toxic gamers who like to harass women in game for no reason.
---
I have noticed that as well. It is really strange
---
that boi flying
---
it's called holographic
---
Like I said, they‚Äôre viable imo. In my opinion. I never said you have to agree mate
---
Well, when you've got no squad mates.. it's a different story.
---
Too slow, too wonky, too garbage. 
---
Vector/mpx are headshot machines with no recoil.
---
Use Ops that let you place items. Like Lesion, so you can gather Intel for your team by noticing where Gu is being stepped on and making calls. 
---
Focus on Ops abilities, make the best use of destructibility in the map too. Create kill holes and rotation holes in good places. you can practice this in a Custom game without being with anyone that could yell or bully you. Try to use Ops in defense that place shit around (Lesion, Jager, Ela, Smoke) 
---
In attack you can use Glaz and he'll highlight people with his scope, if you want to do some dmg. You can use Thermite or Hibana to do hard breaches in good places. Or Thatcher to help your hard breachers. 
---
You might not make it to pro league but you can give a lot to your team even if you're legally blind :) focus on using your Ops abilities as best as you can.
---
[Isn't this is part of unsolicited item that will be sent back unopened?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS2tzDiP7LA&amp;t=568s)

The switch will be worth it in the long run, trust me
---
Well we come from two different opinions.
---
yeah this charm suck
---
Update I figured out how it happened I used my gadget before I vaulted on a rappel
---
Oh no, I have to play balanced game modes now and can't cheese my way up with unbalanced game modes!
---
nah m8 I just need to impress ubi
---
She has an smg with no acog and is 2 speed. Lesion, ela &amp; kapkan will help slow her down or help locate. Then every op with 2 eyes can see her. Any op with an acog can outgun her mid to long range
---
Silver strats are mind boggling
---
Thank you for the information. I'll contact the support for an explanation regarding this.
---
This actually hurts to watch
---
I'm aware, I gave the news about this because the new elites usually always drop on day of release, I even had a community manager confirm it and then they made that post. I'm just relaying what is said because no one seems to look for official information on this sub.
---
3 FPS clutch
---
hardy har nice try at making a joke. Really well done, it's not like that's a no brainer or anything. But it's not like you're still missing the point that Ela is outclassed by just about everyone in the game gun wise and gadget wise. But still nice try.
---
And then mozzies drone behind her, with mozzie flipping her off through his phone
---
why u mad bro?
---
How long does it take to add it? The animation and entire model was announced weeks ago. How would it take this long just to replace the texture and slightly alter the model?
---
This entire update might as well be renamed "Operation It'll Be Released Later" with this, drop shot bug STILL in the game after TTS, and no new deployable shields.
---
Dokkaebi will be infected
---
what are platform are you playing on? This is a issue for console at the moment but not for everyone.
---
I think hes over reacting a little but I've seen so many people talking shit on him after that coreross video so I think its justified.
---
Good
---
luck because you looked too much to the left before shooting
---
That happened to me PC - wasnt there long - it happened after booting from hours off the PC, so i def wasnt in a match too.
---
I never tried to make a joke. If I really was, I‚Äôd have just pointed out this post. 
---
You say it‚Äôs a no brainier yet you‚Äôre complaining about the exact same thing we‚Äôre talking about. If it was a no brainer for you, you wouldn‚Äôt have brought it up.

---
Youre an asshole and you talk to people like they‚Äôre idiots. All of your replies are snark to people who are just disagreeing with you. That‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt have any friends.

---
Aight so you aren't in college, you are in high school. Point still stands. If you aren't going to try to get a 5 man, don't whine about solo q. I'm not a shitty friend, I find people who love video games as much as I do and befriends them and get them to 5 man. You are whining about ranked solo q and not providing a viable solution. That's bitching. Most of the player base in ranked are adults 21 to 28. I don't need to, I have a wife.
---
My bad
---
Thats why you work to find some. It takes a while to build up a group of people. But it can improve your experience a shit ton in the long run.
---
Nobody likes bomb? I guess that's why it's the most played playlist especially in high MMR lobbies.
---
why, the other team is also 3 rounds defending? there is no advantage
---
Bro I had a game where I melee an opponent and he stepped into me and it didn't register and I died to his melee
---
It doesn‚Äôt make sense. Any op with electrical gadgets should have barbed. &amp; Same I loved his gun, his gadget &amp; having barbed. Now I‚Äôm no longer gonna play him sadly.
---
What?
---
She should be a heavy Intel gatherer similar to pulse but instead of giving absolute exact locations, she's more suited to know where they are coming from and stop them or slow them down similar to Echo. Her gadget stuns and slows down the enemy so it tells her team where they are coming from and that they can prepare for it. You can set up barber wire near her gadgets so they continue to be slowed down even after her gadget is no longer active, you get what I'm saying? She isn't in a useless spot it's just that most people don't play her the way she gets the most out of her kit. Give her impacts and more people are going to roam with her, that's not what she's meant for. Stay in a spot with barbed wire and your gadget nearby and snag a kill or more while they are stunned, that way your team is at the advantage and know where they are. If she had a camera then you can know where they are and wait for them to hit your gadget, then when it goes off you can get the enemy by surprise. Her weapons are just a completely different issue as I believe most of her lackluster side comes from her primary and secondary gadgets.
---
People are pretty toxic on this game. I‚Äôve never seen a player base that is like R6. I love the game, but the people have definitely made me step away from it a few times
---
Maybe its the way i have my sound balanced but i dont find it too hard to hear it.
---
Hopefully all the ops

It seems incredibly unfair. The game is sided with towards the defenders, so having 3 rounds start as a defenders gives you a huge advantage.

Then win the defending rounds when the side is switched. If the enemy can do it, you can do it too.

No problem

Mute jammers are weird because they have a radius of effect. Sometimes if people place them a little off it wont get the whole wall. I have had that happend a few times.

I‚Äôm right there with you man. I had a period a few months ago where I‚Äôd get to play about 1-2 games a day. It‚Äôs really miserable to get on for the short amount of time and get kicked / team killed.
---
Strange
---
That doesn't make any sense. If the map is ddfender sided and the team who defends first gets up to 3-0 then the attackers will be able to do the exact same thing for the next three rounds. If they can't do that then the other team wouldv'e won anyway. The 3 round rotation has zero affect on this.
---
Just the siege community doing what they do best

How is dropshotting still existing? I'm no dev but how can you not code the game so that it kicks you off ADS when proning? It seems like something a person who codes for work should be able to handle, especially an entire team of coders. This game is slowly becoming a joke with this, no new weapons for 2 new ops, adding new a new map almost every 3 months with no setting to change map pool, a 4 year Beta for comp, and routine game breaking bugs like invisible players and having shields that block headshots. CSGO and OW are other competitve FPS games with their own tournaments like R6 but these games don't have routine game breaking bugs unlike this game. Every single fucking season we get more broken shit that ruins comp.
---
I don't think they ever made new guns. Both ops have old guns. Pretty clear they never made new ones.

Yeah, the game feels super nice since the update.

That's the point, if one person can carry the game simply because of the game mode it's unbalanced

Id check the monitor setting because i had the same issue and that was the fix

I watched the last 30 minutes of twitch rivals and got it, guess I got lucky

you're the one who brought up the attackers shit though?

Just curious. Why did you fire and detonated pellets at an electrified wall?

Idk, deadlines are pretty important. Maybe just release half a buggy skin even if necessary and then release the rest of the skin in DLC drops. It‚Äôs all the rage these days.

Mouse And Keyboard.

In case of Siege - an adapter device that masks Mouse/Keyboard inputs as Controller inputs.

No, Ubi stated they need to fix a little bit more on them. The same goes for the glitch.

After I downloaded it it wouldn't let me in either. Restarted my PS4 and it let me in. After I played a ranked match I got stuck loading again. Still having issues.
---
Well then no op is bannable, cause I payed for the game and I payed for the season pass. Thats a dumb reasonb and thats the point of pick and ban. To get rid of something. If you really don't want the new ops banned, wait a week or two and people will go back to banning blitz and cav.

Well, considering that the same old bugs reappear every now and again, it means that the game isn't fixed properly, but rather many issues are just slapped on with a band-aid and the devs then hope for the best.  
---
Sorry mate, but no coding experience is needed (I've got only basic skills from my IT Tech school times so while it's not much, it is at least more than your average Joe and I do know the gist of it) to see just how badly the development of Siege is going in terms of its maintenance (and maintenance only, the rest is fine by me and do fare quite well compared to some other AAA titles). The game is riddled with issues that seem hard to fix properly (they reapear every now and again) for whatever reason. Not to mention general issues with the engine, which I also presume wasn't made for first person shooters in the first place (think of Payday 2 or Fallout 3/NV and their troubles with Diesel engine - a racing game engine - and Gamebryo respectively)  
---
I'm not saying the devs are lazy or that they're bad or outright terrible. I'm just saying that, for whatever reason, they either don't take enough care with making sure that the features they're implementing, are not fraking things over in another part of the code, or they're being punished by the code for it being badly implemented at the start of the development (I would REALLY, REALLY not be surprised if parts of the code were written back in the "Rainbow Six Patriots" time either).  
---
And now, years after release, it's simply unviable to rewrite the entire code meaning that they either have to deal with it and fix the stuff as it comes out (which, let's be honest, takes far too much time for such a big company, there's Indie teams that can pump out fixes faster and more reliably than Ubisoft though honestly there are also AAA companies that are slower \*cough\*Bethesda\*cough\*) or they're going to have to face the wrath of the community, mad for receiving a game that doesn't work properly, is riddled with bugs and generally is of low quality, despite its content being really good in general (so operators, gadgets, maps and all that; balance does suffer a bit but that's expected really).  
---
It's entirely possible for them to fix the bugs. It might take more time than the higher ups in Ubisoft might accept though. Or the community. I can already see the cries and whines, after announcing that Ubisoft Montreal will take 2 seasons off the map to basically do "Operation Health 2.0". Not all, many (quite a lot probably) would understand and likely be happy with it, but people would still get mad about it and complain (like they always do).
---
Psychologic effect of it, if you lose 3 times in a row on attack in a defender favored map and vice versa, it is much harder to win since the team's morale will be diminished.
---
his has happened to me 4 times now and i hate it
---
is clash is disabled?
---
Neato
---
Link?
---
Yes because 2 ops for a week is the same as the whole rosterüòÇ salty people who can‚Äôt afford the season pass not banning for any strategic reason at all other than to ruin other peoples fun
---
100% i main her since she was release but it becomes harder and harder, today i couldn't kill zofia within 5m distance (like 50 bullets) im 1000% sure they stealth nerfed her again this patch, 2 of my mates said the same. they should just give her the ump
---
More guns to put my dust line skin on. Perfect
---
You only need to play attacking once if your defense is sufficient for the 3 rounds.
---
I use the 417 anyway so it doesn‚Äôt affect me
---
What difficulty did you do it on?
---
I don‚Äôt see the problem
---
I was frozen from shock.
---
How do you find the advanced gadget deployment section?
---
They will probably find a way to ruin it. Lol!
---
Yeah i was pretty new at that time, not that im any better now.
---
?
---
Don‚Äôt think it will stop them. Moreover, you‚Äôre just lighting up their interest.
---
Remove the edit before I smite you
---
so it‚Äôs not a real disadvantage then.
---
As a Blitz main all I can say is that I should have no advantage over you whatsoever. Playing Blitz should be a disadvantage for the attackers, not the defenders. Yes, he‚Äôs a shield op, and they seem very powerful, but there are a lot of flaws. There‚Äôs a reason he‚Äôs one of my most used ops but my K/D with him is like .7 compared to other ops where my K/D is 8+. He‚Äôs honestly pretty balanced, you just have to know how to fight him. If you‚Äôre having trouble, here‚Äôs some tips: 
---
-shoot his gun hand. It‚Äôs always out, and if you‚Äôve got good aim you can tap fire it and down him. 
---
-aim for the shoulders. The shape of his shield means his shoulders slip into view earlier than the rest of his body. 
---
-Blitz rushes can be countered by shooting the feet.   
---
-His flash has a very low range, try to back step and put something between you and him. 
---
-Use an Op with impacts or a nitro. 
---
Blitz is fun, but I wouldn‚Äôt call him a tumor by any means. He‚Äôs only good at punishing teams that a) try to rush outside to swarm the enemy. B) teams that are caught unprepared and are still prepping. Or c) players who are skittish and can be intimidated by a shield. Other than that, he‚Äôs a relatively weak op.
---
Samee im glad its gone but i worked hard ya know

You shall get the forbidden rank. Obsidian

If only actual Danish women had  t h i c c  hips like that
---
Lul wut
---
Mnk users on console are ridiculously bad
---
She is fit but shes not a weightlifter, she looks fairly normal on her concept/dev images
---
been here since velvet shell. Made a lot of friends and enjoyed almost every moment.
---
Drinks on me !
---
They are also sealed due to her family history. No one is supposed to know her family name
---
When?
---
I am almost as big as she so should I be able to pass spec ops physical test
---
Is it weird that I think it looks like it says "Elo" on the cams there
---
I'm on vacation and i'm craving some ranked r6 matches so badly and ofc the new menu
---
Let me translate: 
---
Nevermind I have no idea
---
The point system is jacked, it's now only bomb (which dont get me wrong I like bomb), and they have made so many bad adjustments in an effort to stop team killing.
---
I mean ur thing did say you were losing connection
---
Lmao
---
Lol. People this days cant take a joke. You need a good dickin. Let me know
---
Front page or bust
---
Came back on, Did 2 more games. Got stomped first three rounds then both times winning team surrendered.
---
Ranked is honestly worse then casual.   So much bullshit trolling and tk'ing combined with purposefully afking and not playing the objective or straight up deranking groups.
---
Allied esports minor charm.
---
Other operators that would be useful are:
---
Caveria
---
Sledge
---
Thatcher (Very Useful Against Technological Parasites)
---
Gridlock
---
Captain
---
And our lord and savior.
---
What the frick
---
You went from 31 to 29.
---
Hello Majdy776! **It looks like your post is about recruiting players or looking for a team.** Be sure to check out these great resources for teamfinding:
---
Don't worry, the wait is just a little prick.
---
Solid season. Hate bomb though. Makes Ranked not very fun for me and my friends.
---
Entitled much
---
Then like I said, the C4 should be swappable or swapped out with his impact grenades. I don't know of any other op that can chose between two damaging explosives.
---
season pass owners get the ops a week earlier for no cost
---
Serect  yur cur
---
always shotgun
---
Pick and ban dumbass
---
No
---
nope I hate it as well. theres pros and cons to both obviously but I thnk the pros far outweigh the cons for switching every round
---
Season pass owners get them a week early. :/
---
The new ops are available now for season pass owners.  Available to everyone else in 7 days.
---
How about making him an alternative to Maestro but he doesn't see through smoke . Like he should get one of [these](https://img.fireden.net/v/image/1464/72/1464720556526.png) and does like 1 damage per 0.5 sec maybe ? and penetrates through shield
---
To be fair, the AUG A3 is an AR not an SMG, it even says assault rifle in kaid's profile on the r6 website, which would explain the ADS time of an AR because it is one
---
I grinded it and went 2x more on the thunt missions and never got it. Maybe if I dust off my PS4 it will finally plat. It was the only trophy I had left and it was bugged.
---
I love her shotgun and pistol. Absolutely despise the Scorpion.
---
Does it really make much difference? they'll still run into it a million miles an hour anyway /s
---
You have to be a season pass owner to use them now, a week for everyone else to purchase them
---
Red ring of death?
---
They can't, you can't just poof away DoS attacks.
---
I like ‚Äúyour own style‚Äù. If all your drawings are that thicc I need you to draw some things for me
---
t hunt, boosters
---
The operators come day 1 if you have the season pass. If you havent its sometime later i think its 2 or 1 week.
---
My issue is recycling garbage guns
---
obviously, but it‚Äôs been in the game for years.
---
Buy the Ultimate edition
---
I got the GSG9 set and a couple other black ices. Now I just use glacier.
---
I‚Äôm confused.
---
That could also be apleid to me and I am 15 so I should not be able to pass spec ops physical test
---
Why?
---
Nokk is a woman
---
I thought that the sp owners would have got them a week ago
---
apparently the bug is only that the gu mine is invisible, like there's no way to see it anymore so you're probably right.
---
Holy, calm down kiddo. He/she was saying that he/she deserves to get the operators for a lower price just because the pick and ban. And they also already do that
---
They changed it, the achievement was bugged forever. Now I guess they fixed it.
---
Yep
---
It's supposed to be from the Vegas minor event, but from what I've seen ubi screwed up charm activation times and you could also get it by watching UbiE3.
---
It‚Äôs 100% Ok, he just wanted to point out something, you can clearly see what he meant. No need for better quality if you can tell what his point is.
---
Instead of adding more maps they changed a bad map to make it good. And they added a failsafe but Clash bypassed it somehow.
---
wait what
---
No, N√∏kk is [REDACTED]
---
It's not something "in the game".
---
But hibana is also above average height and in spec ops
---
They actually used to Email out Weekly and Monthly stats for you and then a season stat block for the end of seasons. Sadly that's sorta not a thing anymore even though according to support it still is.
---
Her smg os the worst weapon of the whole game. It's unusable. But she has a very good shotgun and a good pistol
---
Hello slettebo96, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bzis87/the_perspective_problem_vizualised/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Not my fault,
---
Someone put a Lion in my way.
---
That was one hell of a concussion you got when he slapped you in the face with his shield.
---
Is it possible that you are the one who is too light my little Estonian troll?
---
By that logic I should be able to join spec ops
---
I think they put failsafes. That is to say it will detect if you do the glitch it will cancel it out. Deployables will be put on the ground after a couple of seconds, IQ will be visible again and Clash does...something.
---
Monty is cancer
---
Thats cool but I think that would be too similar to Maestro. But idk pretty nice idea!
---
If you want me to try again, then they should have just left Glaz alone. He was fine before the update, from both an attacker and defender standpoint.
---
How does that make your original comment any more relevant
---
But right on to her head? And that was not 1 millimeter
---
When I first played Rainbow I figured the scope it's supposed to have would be patched in to replace it's Acog. That never happened.
---
Bro I was like 0.7 with camper (I only play classic) and when I longed on today it just gave it to me
---
Yes and no
---
Th√Økk
---
True
---
Thank you!! Whatever happens, it was totally worth it. One of the best experiences of my life has been sharing this story with the Siege community over the last year!
---
No they havent.
---
Pro league rules involve. Ore then pick/ban and 3 round rotation.
---
I'll add u but I'm not on rn
---
Only if it‚Äôs by a cheater (hacker)
---
Yeah, obviously, I just liked how good the data matched.
---
We had the entire weekend of it to inform them it's bad for general gameplay but great for pro league.
---
I had to go on this sub on either desktop mode for mobile, or just go on this sub and it's on the upper right towards options
---
Okay nomad main
---
mlem
---
It's not a new season if they don't readd a bug or two. This is old school r6s
---
He‚Äôs trying his best give him a break!
---
They get reverse friendly fire
---
Thanks! Ur my favorite mod.
---
You got to admit the siege community has more toxic players than most
---
I think you should just play casual. I dont even understand what is it you are complaining about when you have the perfect gamemode for you already.
---
If only the human brain wasn't flawed.
---
On PC, it's on the sidebar (right side), [juste above the bottom of the picture " (edit) " button](https://i.imgur.com/pw1sRuK.png)
---
Oh, thats horrible. I tought they would get reviewed and maybe banned :(
---
I don't think she's a robot, but I'm not a big fan of the bag on her head. I really wish I hard a mustache like Warden though. Like, I would use him just for that glorious mustache. 
---
Just comparing the design for these two operators, most that come out in pairs share a somewhat similar aesthetic. Warden looks very formal and reminds me of Commissioner Gordon. While N√∏kk makes me think a shy teen whose doesn't want to be recognized at the Hot Topic.
---
Is it just me or is Glaz floating
---
The person who team killed you gets the red triangle next to their name - so now when they shoot someone on their team they take the damage as opposed to the team member
---
Yea he‚Äôs either confused or he‚Äôs a dumb
---
Which they had in the Pro League playlist
---
nah he should be a pizza maker or someone that makes spaghetti and meatballs
---
Thx found it
---
For one single team kill? That‚Äôs a bit extreme.
---
Well shit no worries now my homie just bought me the season pass. Time to fight all the other plebs on my team for Nokk lol.
---
If it does it would be better. What I mean by that is that even if you play at copper you are playing with people that like and understand pvp not pvers, not saying there's something wrong with them but it's just a fact that most of the time pvp mains will be better.
---
Season ‚Äùwe dont care about the glitches haha"
---
Running shotgun suppressed and not the d50 but also suppressed.
---
Maximum spoop
---
I'm ok with bugs popping up. It's that they knew there was a bug, didn't fix it, then put the exploits back in anyway. So you couldn't fix the Clash glitch. Fine, keep working on it until it's done. Don't put her back in anyway and assume it'll be fine.
---
Hello hacibeko, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bzjm02/wtf_ubisoft_are_you_out_of_ur_mind/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Yep the best start
---
That bag is what the Danish special forces wear in real life.
---
HELLOOOOO MONIKA
---
Get flanked is another man child like kg that wants a career from whining about stuff in video games
---
Well, yea it is but that is not going to change the fact that teamkilling is a huge problem.
---
Time travelling Buck main
---
No, the recoil patterns are the same. It‚Äôs also why using mnk on console gives such a huge advantage despite the input lag.
---
He just came out damn
---
I lost 5 and won 5 got placed gold 3. Confused on how you got silver.
---
Sorry I meant Y3S4* lol
---
I wish they would make it so that when you shot someone in the head you would automatically die if it was intentionally.
---
Why you gotta be like this?
---
Wow. I wish I could go to siege school.
---
Sorry my grammar is horrible
---
OwO
---
Nice man! I cant wait to play hadn't had a chance I was busy playing Bl pre sequel.
---
How is N√∂kk? I cant wait to try her out
---
They removed all the THunt/Situations trophies and replaced them with new ones that are multiplayer focused. A good addition imo.
---
So you just never buy a gamer ever?
---
What about Smokes?
---
Hmmmm no boosting is still bannable no matter what
---
Clash and monty shoot while shield is back on the game so i wouldn't be surprised if IQ starts to reglitch again.
---
Secure area is a great game mode. But continue on with your childish banter because the game mode you like happened to be the one thet kept, while others are upset that their favorite game mode was taken away, and they feel likw they got ripped off paying money for a game that was literally taken away from them. They should have issued an optional refund option for the game along with the new update.
---
Shootout to the two randoms that started all the weird funny tactics, had a great time with them.
---
Its highly implied that she was raised by a single mom and never met her dad so the illegitimate child theory makes a lot of sense.
---
Thought they said they added recoil to it
---
Not even funny. To quote Vincent Vega "What's more chickenshit than fucking with a man's automobile? I mean, don't fuck with another man's vehicle."
---
Just now i get comfy whit using the iron sight
---
I quite like it
---
Ok let me know when your able to play
---
Does it reset for casual at the beginning of the season?
---
If you were any good with Buck it‚Äôs so much easier (at least for me)
---
But Is glaz left handed?
---
And I think that's about it.
---
-Bubba
---
And Fortress. I really, really don't like that map, and of course it was my very first ranked game this season...
---
They don't play multiple matches. You're thinking of LAN events and PL Finals. Actual playdays are only 1 match, and use this exact format.
---
Really? I did not know that. 
---
I would like to amend my previous statement, *the Danish Special Forces look like shy teens that don't want to be recognized at the Hot Topic.* 
---
I'm gonna say it, those bag things look really funny, and I kind of dig it.
---
Nokk would be useful too wouldnt she since she can also be silent even nomad would be useful as well as kaid
---
After the initial kill they will die if they try again
---
According to the graph doing the rounds I should be high silver, as demonstrated by my Grim Sky performance? I'm willing to accept I'm not great at the game but Copper came as a shock!
---
Double poop
---
Lmao what? This isn‚Äôt an opinion, the bans literally say banned for being boosted by a cheater... use your eyeballs.  You‚Äôre on crack if you think someone gets banned for being carried in ranked.
---
What you mean? New ranked is great. The only thing thats fucked is the return of the exploits
---
This isnt really a rare thing in r6s, you can play for 1 night and get a similar situation
---
This is gonna be top voted, bet
---
I'm a fuze main
---
mo lol shes a human her background is redacted
---
So you think it's okay if a plat player goes on copper and Carrie's someone through that match therefore ruining everyone else's match? Are you sure you're  on crack
---
T H I K K
---
Glad you had a good time man, hope you can eventually get the game!
---
Who do you use more
---
I‚Äôm telling you what the bans are for, dumbass. Not giving my opinion on what I think is okay.
