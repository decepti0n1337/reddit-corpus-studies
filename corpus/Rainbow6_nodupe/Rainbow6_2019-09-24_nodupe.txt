Operators drop in price by 5000 renown every four seasons, to a minimum price of 10000 renown.

But, to avoid doing the math on all that, a moderator on the Rainbow6 discord made a handy graphic that keeps track of this stuff and gets updated each season! Which you can find here: https://siege.dangeraspect.xyz/operatorprices

Maverick is only really good on certian maps or rooms. Like house for example he has no real purpose unless they are in garage because a roamer will catch him creepily staring through a peephole.

What a band aid solution. Instead of fixing the real problem, the nonsense RFF which almost is never consistent, they opt to make the freaking hostage fire resistant. Too add insult to injury they made him universally fire resistant as they couldn't even be bothered to implement code that distinguishes between capitao and goyo. The amount of lazy shortcuts, baffling number of user hostile descisions and the bizzare number of bugs that re-emerge leads me to either two conclusions. Either Ubisoft is made up of wholly incapable people, which I refuse to even acknowledge because of their AAA status they seem to enjoy so much, or the game engine at use is exceptionally hard to use and implement features which leads to the tower of band aids we have today called r6 siege. With the amount of micro transactions and extra season passes and other frankly disgusting gambling purchases this game has, Ubisoft needs to get their shit together and fix their broken game, make Operation Health 2: Revengence and last it for a damn year if they have to. Anyway I'm pissed off and the bumpy bus ride that takes 7 hours might have something to do with it as well but my fine points still stand as sensible inarguablr truths posted on an internet board thingy.

I‚Äôm just gonna give you the benefit of the doubt here. He‚Äôs a bad person, distance yourself, it was only three matches you should be good.

Least favorite has to be ela, yeah her gadget is useful in certain scenarios and her pistol is great i cant deal with the recoil of the primaries along with the only ela mains i have met have been toxic

Iv had 6 apple devices thank you very much. Each one of them went thru the shit of them sending an update to cap the battery percentage for "safety reasons"(which is bullshit cuz batteries degrade overtime to a point where they can't overcharge to cause a safety issue) not to mention the updates that they were caught on for purposely slowing down their old devices. Im sorry but i just cant justify their money grubbiness anymore...not to mention they are 2 generations behind samsung when compared parts wise and charging as if they were top of the line
---
Probably Ash. Unpopular opinion, oh no! I can't go a single match without someone going Ash. I need some variety. She's so overly used and I found a way to counter her. It makes the game boring when people constantly go Ash.

I am Canadian so I mainly follow the North American (NA) region. Some of the better more exciting teams in NA right now are SpaceStation Gaming (SSG), Evil Geniuses, Team Reciprocity, Dark Zero and Team Solo Mid (TSM).
---
In the European region the team G2 is the most successful team that rainbow six esports has ever seen and because of that they are super popular. There was basically almost two years where they won pretty much everything. They are still a great team but havent been as dominant lately. A russian team called Empire has emerged as one of the stronger EU teams lately.
---
In the Latin American (LATAM) scene Ninjas in Pyjamas (NIP), Faze and Liquid are all very popular.

Amati is very fun to play when u don‚Äôt die right off the bat. I almost aced with her grappling into trophy on chalet in the window over the two garage doors.
---
They still have them? Also what conventions in specific
---
Why do you think hes cheating? Everyone who cheats is bad at the game
---
here's a few reasons why she can't have better guns
---
- Nokk has a special animation where she crosses her arm over her other while using her ability and gun, it would be difficult removing that animation
---
- Since Nokk has already finished testing and has been released it's too late to give her a new gun entirely 
---
- the developers tested her with a different gun testing with an ACOG and all I heard was it was too strong
---
- ubi can keep buffing her ability to where she's completely quiet
---
- her gun isn't the issue it's because she's loud.
---
The irony is so thick I can swim in it.
---
Dope paint job üëçüèΩ

---
u/I-wanna-fuck-alibi I know see why you want to fuck alibi
---
That etsy store is overpriced as shit
---
Defender wise Goyo is better in so many ways compared to warden from gadget to loadout options, attacking thought I'm very biased because nokk is my baby , her gadget is by far more useful and i prefer her SMG and shotty over amarus lmg and the supernova but I never really liked them in the first place, plus 1 deagling is extremely satisfying
---
Expectations: Black ice for the R4C
---
Reality: Swole Rubber Ducky that hangs off your gun and instills fear into your enemies.
---
God I love the fact even in game ash is known for being the fuck your shit I don‚Äôt need intel operator
---
That's true and no one can deny that
---
Better than the ingame models lol. Totally worth my upvote as it‚Äôs no some crap art. Looks like u put a lot of work into it.
---
I got black ice for the Russian lmg and for my alt black ice on the CAMRS
---
Hey it may be a seran wrapped paper plate but at least it‚Äôs... uh... recyclable?

Because it means they are better then them in terms of positioning and game sense. People who  use a mnk usually expect their aim to win them the game when that isn‚Äôt the case.

120 pounds for a god damn piece of plastic for an outbreak face mask, with out plastic, and doesn't work, you could buy a working mask that they modeled the ob mask from for the same price, military seller, and comes with the glass too, that place is just a giant money farm.
---
Noo it doesn‚Äôt, maestro has lost his shield already so I can‚Äôt climb shit Anymore, no he doesn‚Äôt need a nerf
---
Well part of the tell between realibi and holo alibi is that the holograms are very low res compared to her, so if we‚Äôre keeping that then every skin would need a hologram version that is ‚Äúlower res‚Äù the fun part of that is that as far as the game is concerned (and so you don‚Äôt get a headache looking at them) the holograms aren‚Äôt actually lower res just modeled to look like it. So the easy fix would be to remove this ‚Äúlow res‚Äù nerf on the holos but then yea

**54.4 kilograms** for a god damn piece of plastic for an outbreak face mask, with out plastic, and doesn't work, you could buy a working mask that they modeled the ob mask from for the same price, military seller, and comes with the glass too, that place is just a giant money farm.

I was once tked because "maga"

He was used there at USN or something recently. Maybe Canadian Nationals actually. He got thatchered, then flashed and killed. 
---
A player later said they didn‚Äôt know Thatcher could do that. So good call. That is a ‚Äògood‚Äô spot. But still. Often flashes are used they to clear and ADS, then it‚Äôs naded. So he‚Äôs still vulnerable there if they cleared ADSes. 
---
So ehhhh. Even then I‚Äôd rather have Ela. Because I doubt I‚Äôll be flashed. Upvoted anyway because it‚Äôs a solid idea theoretically and a good use of a trash op haha
---
Is that Steve Carell?
---
Are you gay?
---
people don't understand balancing, if ubi were to go in and change her loadout it would take them likely another season as well as remove the arm animation which would make things more complicated, Animations aren't easy thus why Nokk will keep her loadout and the guns will likely get buffed in the future.
---
Nope I think it's fine, at least for me, but then again I do use a razer kraken x headset so maybe just get a better headset or a new one
---
Gotta rebind now xD
---
Happy cake day
---
Working on a tutorial now, saved this comment and will link when it goes up
---
high pings mate, unplayable.
---
As they say in Russia: screw you.
---
What run are you doing tho
---
This is 100% accurate
---
sneaking can get you killed and Nokk has to worry about barbed wire and traps, With her loadout she barely wins many firefights.
---
Depends on price
---
I kinda understand the "as if spawnpeek never happened" that's not really true, since if attacker walked there, he would probably be dead. It's as much of a gamble as any spawnpeek. Every time you peek a spawn, you gamble that attackers spawned there. Just like peeking only 1 angle, you gamble that they will walk there, while keeping risk to a minimum by not exposing yourself. 
---
Second, you have a big chance to deny attackers both utility and a player before they even have a chance to use it while you only risk a player. I think that usual spawn peek has about 50-50 probability of working, so I still think that it's too worthy of a trade
---
Not the place for this man. Even if it's a joke.

Definitely genocide

it was part of a ghost recon wildlands event, twitch pretty much spelled out shes a lesbian
---
Oh. Should have credited in the title.
---
While you claim that the one angle leaves the attacker pretty much dead if they step there, i disagree. That goes along with my argument that attackers need to check their windows/doors as they enter the area. Even if the attacker has their one angle, they still have to punch open the window/door, leaving an easy to spot hole for the attackers that they can use to either prefire the spawnpeek or avoid it all together.
---
As with denying the players utility and numbers, that plays back on the negligence argument. You say that spawn peeking has a roughly 50/50 chance of working, but i disagree. With the attacker advantage, it works at a much smaller ratio. The times it does work is either a broken peek (bank) or, once again, attacker negligence
---
you can use any type of drawing app. It‚Äôs simply preference.

New update broke my game. Was crashing now all players are skipping/hitching all over the fucking place and I cant shoot anyone. What a mess. 
---
Lost 5 levels in ranked due to CE errors and now this.

Why are you really trying to disagree with me here? This post is more of a highlight, not if the player is on MnK or not. I shouldnt have to explain why I think this. I know the difference throughout the whole match.
---
Ubi recommends you restart the queue every five minutes.
---
So I decided to do all of my placements tonight because I‚Äôm tired of waiting to hear that people have stopped DDOSing. All of my games so far have taken about 4 minutes to find a session. So, after my last game, I decided to search for a new match and browse the Modern Warfare subreddit while I wait. 
---
After a while, I realise that I‚Äôve not been in a game for a long time so I check how long it‚Äôs been and I‚Äôm greeted by this bad boy. 
---
The worst thing is that I know once I restart searching for a game, I‚Äôll get one in about 2 minutes. *sigh*
---
Lol
---
I was on my phone and didn‚Äôt realise how long it‚Äôd been. 
---
About to restart right now :)
---
Ah I forgot about that during my many seizures I had, but who knows we don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs canonically true.
---
If you hit constant head shots I'd run the smg it's a beast if you can hit them, the shotty on the other hand is an ol reliable great for murder holes , hatches or rotations , and always use the deagle with the muzzle break, while the silencer goes along with her idea of stealth, the recoil is still pretty hard to control but the muzzle break makes hit your target so much easier and you don't lose damage so you hit like a school bus
---
Emojis on my reddit. reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
Yeah I‚Äôm sorry.

Razer headsets are comfy as i‚Äôve notice, however they‚Äôre bulky and thick. Logitech ones vary from version. I like the Razer Kraken or the Kraken X (Kraken X is only $50) it‚Äôs a good headset that‚Äôs you can‚Äôt really go wrong with. It comes down to what you like, your best bet would be to go to a best buy/computer store, and test them out.

ubi probably tested her wth a bunch of defender SMG's before she released and found the only one to be balanced for her is the FMG-9

You don't need to reload if you can kill with just one shot. *Taps head*
---
I got black ice for jaeger and bandit

After bs losses and with a splash of hackers/ddosers. But it'll go away and then you'll be back in the saddle.
---
Youre really dumb my guy, its glaz.
---
Mate did you ever consider the possibility that he might just play with a high sensitivity?
---
I am jealous, my favourite skin on my favourite gun, nice.
---
When they move to the area for spawnpeeking. Like when they're late
---
Why post it 2 times?
---
Gotta be ash right?
---
I can't read developers' mind but I would bet, that spawn peeks weren't intended on launch of the game either. In a sense, it's an exploit. I wouldn't have a problem if there were more spawns or entrances from the spawns, but there are usually 3 at most.
---
I got a glaz pistol skin
---
Yea. Ubi looks more into pc then console bc we are the minority of r6 and it‚Äôs just how it goes for us. Pc is where they focus but for console it‚Äôs more of let‚Äôs let them figure it out and leave them guns that can‚Äôt be used at all with even the most recoil control and can barley control bucks rifle and I‚Äôm In plat. It‚Äôs just how the cookie crumbles
---
wait there are other operators ***other*** than tachanka?
---
What is with all the Caby x Doc shit going around
---
Please tell us if you get this job! Lol
---
Ya, but if they lay down they can‚Äôt shoot us through the window. Gives us just treat extra couple seconds to reposition out of spawn.
---
That 90 bullet reload tho üòÇ
---
Bro come on im trying to do the thing where i woosh em with my name. I need kaaaarma
---
TIME TO PUT UO A LITTLE SHOW !
---
*plays uno reverse card*
---
Look up the reveal trailer for Skull Rain or Favela. The devs show footage of a tachanka with all the walls broken around him shooting outside. 
---
The defenders defend from inside. But the interaction with outside was always intended. Otherwise you‚Äôd have a lopsided interaction with the outdoor angles where defenders wouldn‚Äôt be allowed to use the angles available to attackers. Look at glaz. He was originally meant to camp in towers like on old Kafe or House. Those were meant to be shot at as well as from. It was clearly designed to have interaction.
---
Great work! Looks awesome

But cav is ash's lover, not doc's

Probably a match before
---
No it would make her strong, she has weak guns for a reason that and nobody would ever use the deagle.
---
Careful. Make sure to throw the match against the hacker. The Ubisoft community manager official response for this is to intentionally lose otherwise you'll be punished (if you beat the hacker and Ubisoft bans them) by an MMR revoke.

#Ranked Match

We already have heelies. It's why we can slide around while aiming without any deviation.

Now we just need to explain our lack of breathing or slight motions in our arms.

Yeah... it does not

it says it may impact your experience **because** it may overlap with other game elements

Everyone feels squishy in OW whereas siege everyone feels like paper

I had a couple of pretty nice ones one night and I had to kindly tell them I don‚Äôt add or regularly play with anyone under 17.

But yeah no squeakers are awful 9 times out of 10.

That‚Äôs... either ridiculously amazing luck or cheating.

Dollar store hacks

well this sure aint assassin's creed

i can't belive how toxic the community has become offline i hear of players having their homes vandalised because they lost

That‚Äôs part of the recent patch.  It was unintended and finally got fixed.
---
Oh, you're talking about ranked. Yeah, you only get rewards at end of season. It kind of blows, but whatever.
---
I never understood this need for cosmetic rewards in competitive games
---
 nice
---
If they are playing mute and mozzie this is an effective way to see who else is on their team, doesn‚Äôt work all the time of course but thats my only explanation
---
What's the point of boosting if that really isn't his skill placement. He's just going to get more shit in actual ranked games not holding his weight
---
I know highschool is a mess but the fuck kind of "friends" do you guys have around that takes in game ranks serious enough to bully a kid over it?
---
I'm no famous YouTuber and I want new guns
---
..What? Where? When? From who did you got this weird info?
---
Do you mean like on overwatch every time you level up you get a loot box?

And then the same people have stayed faithful to Ash's same r4c for 2 years without changing whatsoever but are revolting against reuse of guns.

Irony smh my head.

Who do you have and what's your playstyle?

Sexism should be allowed in games since all the characters are fictional.

I‚Äôm sick of people seeing bs posts like this ‚Äúi sWeAR I hEAdsHoT HiM!!1!1!!‚Äù And hopping on the ‚Äúubi is bad‚Äù bandwagon. Honestly if you look through these clips they are obviously neck/shoulder shots
---
I'm saying you're bad
---
im not sure but once i saw a vid where someone crates a custom match where he could select the server for the cutsom match. he starts and leaves the lobby so his server changes to the server selected in the custom match. maybe u could give it a try
---
Give everyone swimsuits. I dont see the point in people caring. Don't like dont buy. I want good gameplay.  But all swimsuits would be kinda funny.
---
pulse looks like fps doug
---
Because we don‚Äôt need to sexualize pixels lmao.
---
so you assuming she could get a new gun because it's gone?
---
Whatever the problem, the player does not have to restart the game client to reconnect. In other projects, this is well implemented. I just want Ubisoft to turn their attention to this, as this would improve the convenience of the game for the players.
---
I'm 6 years old? Why because you have no clue what your talking about and have no rebuttal?
---
Yeah i'm on ps4 and I can't do that too
---
not funny
---
Except that was clearly two shots,
---
Watch the patch notes, a lot oft secondary gadget changed.
---
Not really no. I just think the animation argument doesn‚Äôt work anymore since she no longer has that unique animation.
---
Any logic behind this? Seems like a nonsensical decision, seeing as you need cover to watch cams
---
Just pulling your leg:-)
---
lol it's like we cant have fun being bad or what?
---
I'd rather have no weapon than a weapon with a elephant skin
---
Then move on
---
Ahh, I didn't catch that second flick lol
---
You should read The latest patch notes
---
It's not fan made. There are always 2 elite skins per season and the second one always leaks right after the test server goes live because Ubisoft puts them in the game files for some reason
---
I mean. You didn‚Äôt bother droning.

As the classic dark souls saying goes...

they might give her a better secondary maybe, people keep suggesting a machine pistol

No, because we're all very insecure and like to show that by talking shit to other people.

if u use blitz ur automatically bad

Wtf is that defense room setup?!

If you cant counter blitz then youre retarded, no way you have more mmr than 100.

Was monty btw

Nice try.

they're both easy to counter they're just crutch ops imoü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Goyo is good, definitely consistently competetive imo. Warden is meh, he actually has uses in some situations, considering how smoke heavy some of the bombsites can be and that the mpx is insanely good, but overall a niche pick. Amaru is better than n√∏kk because even though they both have subpar, extremely situational abilities, which *can* be used well (but that's more reliant on the enemy team being in the wrong place at the wrong time or having 0 gamesense), Amaru has good guns, and n√∏kk does not. Meaning even if she has no opening to use her ability, or if she gets in a tough spot, you can consistently win straight gunfights against competent enemies. N√∏kk can't really do that.

Yes police, this man right here.

Joke aside, nice works!

The stock sits too low for the AR-15 platform's buffer tube, making this look more like an AK pattern rifle.
---
Same the main server I play on is basically dead so if I can‚Äôt swap them I‚Äôm done
---
Warden has his uses in higher ranks. Heck I have used the ability in casual games a couple of times. And it‚Äôs saved my life. The thing is people like blitz and ying get banned quite a bit and warden is a massive counter to these guys. So you kind of remove the ability and need to use him in that instance.

That's one of the thing I thought they'd do too but they didn't spawn peek. The Valkyrie just sprayed through both window barricades in prep phase and went away. Didn't throw her cams too, I don't think.

***Breach of Rule #9***, namely:

Image macros include simple image edits like superimposing text or other imagery as well as applying filters.

There is a VERY good chance they will do this again in some form, ubi is know. For there bullshittery, and with the positive reception of this event I have a feeling it‚Äôll happen again in some form or other.

Im reminded of it every time I play [tachanka](https://imgur.com/a/OdInymy)

I recommend playing Montaigne and helping the team with support, as montaigne you spend most of your time as a spectator learning map and behavior and you can pull sick clutches out of your ass

---
The most satisfying one being the ban waves
---
I think people banning Clash because they don't understand how to play against her. I've seen tons of games, where groups of enemies just look at Clash for 2 minutes straight, and they don't even try to rush and kill her.
---
Same thing with Blitz, IMO. Right now he's not that strong and popular, but still often in ban on gold 2-3.
---
What you're gonna use the ash breach charge for?
---
Exactly. Either red dot or reflex on the AUG for me

Squats\* fuck

Yes, but you also *see further*

Since you just started you could go with rook doc ash sledge and if you want more advanced operators to play i recommend lesion and ying

I think it's back, at least on PC I did it a few times some days ago.

I loved this event

Is this all because Montagne is useless against clash lol?

I‚Äôve just jumped on so I‚Äôm down to play.

Unranked on my current account but I hit Plat last season and I‚Äôve gotten Silver 1/Gold 3 on my main account and 2 alternate accounts.

You can't judge hits by bloodsplatter. Go frame by frame and check when your magazine's bullet count goes down by one, that's the moment when the game determines where you hit.

Yup. You can play Fortnite and a few other games using mkb by simply plugging it in.

It‚Äôs been a feature for years.

You‚Äôve never gotten head?üòÇ

&gt; about 200 -260 fps

I think that's the issue right there. I would try limiting your frames to where CPU is at about 80%. In my experience Siege is very CPU heavy, I'm sure your CPU can do a lot but even that has its limits.

I don't want to be reminded.

As a sledge main I bet you like house too haha. I think a part of it is because I love the amount of soft walls because it opens up the playing field for possible strategies whether you're attacking or defending.

19 years on a game is like permanent imo.

Oh sweet i will try it as well! I missed it a lot

Hope they fix this aswell in the future
---
I'm pretty much good on everything new, I was meaning playing super aggressive as well making smarter decisions.
---
And he has logic on his side
---
Yeah so if it‚Äôs your first season ranked before your first placement you will start around 2500 elo gaining or loosing around 100 each match so that‚Äôs why your playing golds once you are placed you will play people around your rank

happens with me with gamea or even updates and even tho I have friend with 89 games it doesn't happen to him. Anyways just delete useless stuff u have like pictures games and your saved data of them amd the you should be fine. It works but doesnt fix it so you'll have to do it the same thing again if it happens again
---
At youre first placement match the game assigns you 2500 elo, (high silver, low gold) with an uncertainty of 7.smt so the more you play the less elo you get. If you win all youre placements youll likely get plat3-2

Awesome!
---
Yeah once I hit around 2k hours I realized I needed a break
---
Yeah, thats how I am. I'll pick an operator if my team needs it in a way that theres a hard breacher, i play thatcher in that way but if my team has that combo already I play my main.

1 bar per 100 mmr points.

Yea

I mean, in the details, it says that the s10 roni is a pistol.
---
&gt; So I'm copper
---
Buddy, thats not something you want people knowing (I'm kidding ik it was a typo lol)
---
That‚Äôs still a bad idea and you‚Äôre only playing operators that are almost never explicitly needed. Sometimes IQ is needed or is at least one of a couple options to get a specific job done, and sometimes Nomad is a good idea but not really ever a total necessity. The others are more of a ‚Äúwe have the operators we need and the last one or two players can bring whoever they want‚Äù type operators.
---
You should be willing to play Thermite, Thatcher, Buck, Capitao, Hibana, and really just anybody when they‚Äôre needed. Just like on defense you should be willing to play Bandit, Mira, Kaid, Castle or whoever else when they‚Äôre needed. If there‚Äôs a team of five people that aren‚Äôt willing to play, for example, Thermite when he‚Äôs needed then you‚Äôre only going to win when the other team blows it.
---
You don‚Äôt have to completely master every operator, for example I don‚Äôt know good Valk cam spots for every room on every map. But I know how to Bandit trick, I know what rooms need a Castle and where, I know when we need a Buck and why, I know when we need a Thermite vs a Hibana and when it‚Äôs a good idea to have both, etc., etc.

 Damn, you‚Äôre edgy.

I started playing siege when operation chimera was released and nobody was playing article 5,but now everybody and there mothers are playing it lol. I would love for this to be in every map in the game tho. Also R.I.P to the bombers cause it‚Äôs way to easy now.
---
What‚Äôs in the canister?
---
Repost cough of an artist drawing of it for karma
---
Damn that is shit ton of hours played. You must be bored and Sick of Siege by now.
---
It is you just have to be a big enough dickhead my friend got perma banned for being an all around dick
---
Ahh yes perfection
---
I upvoted this post before even seeing it
---
Why the fuck do the reinforcement studs even protrude the way they do to cause damage to anything close to it on the other side? Its so stupid. can't recall how many team gadgets I've destroyed because the game thinks that reinforcing a wall needs to create a small blast radius. Absolutely stupid
---
i really wish, they'de reintroduce their old events. I mean they said Outbreak was way to heavy on the servers for a custom game mode, but it also was pretty cool imo. same with basically every other event. great cosmetics and a nice fun game mode for a week.
---
Oh god, finally!
---
This ruined the whole operation phantom sight to me
---
This low-key fire
---
Do I see the pro leage set?
---
Basically what you said was if you put a hole in a soft wall you can't see through it but if a maverick does one in a re-enforced wall you can. The soft wall hole is only the slightest bit smaller no difference.
---
It's not much different. More people are just dicks. But hey pretty colored rank oohhh

true I belive it is since operation health that they track all these things for the public API, also don't forget PvE time which usually is about 10% of your PvP time. This post was more meant for newer players asking for help, then telling they are level 130 with 600 hours, I at level 220 have barely 900 so there must be also menu time and PvE included.
---
This fucking sub, I swear

You mean in every siege season? Ye...

I said a bullet hole. A defender for example will make.ot.amd will see the attacker, while the attacker can't see a bullet hole from a few meters away

people dislike it when others stubbornly stick to their inaccurate views when evidence is right in front of them disproving it? wow, reddit is such a shithole!! ^^^^/s
---
You don‚Äôt have to worry about jews anymore
---
How did you find your group?
---
Quite a few mistakes down there my friend.
---
&gt;I'm not talking specifically about ash's guns. I'm talking generally about the G36C not being too strong a weapon to add for another operator. Why's it a silly comparison?
---
Because it isn't practical. It has the 5th lowest TTK, beaten only by the r4c, f2, ak12, c7e (the ones you mentioned above) and still beats the rest. You wouldn't want it on a high influence gadget, but on a low influence gadget, it would be good to balance it out.
---
And against defenders, no primary has a lower ttk than the g36c except the alda.
---
 
---
&gt; Also all the ttk listed are such at 0m, before the dropoff.
---
No ttks on the rogue 9 sheet are from 0-25 constant for ARs, 0-18 for smgs, and all ttks upto 40m. Average kill distance by Ubi is 9m, and max engagement distance is around 25m. 
---
&gt; I can't find a heat map, but DPS is a better indication of how the gun behaves over a varying distance due to the linear decrease.
---
Dps is useless a stat even considering range because ttk clearly tells you how quickly a gun reaches 100. There is no legitimate benefit of knowing how much damage I do in a second. It makes much more sense to see how quickly I can kill.
---
&gt; There's also still the fact that the ttk, DPS, or whatever you want to use is quantitative, not qualitative. Or that the ttk of the G36C might be good at 0m, but the damage is only 38, meaning that it's going to drop into the 4 shot to kill much faster than any other rifle, meaning in practice the ttk is probably lower.
---
Compared to what? The Ttk is 5th highest, better than any gun with 800+ RPM, which aren't many, and which you wouldn't want to give to any future operator with an influential gadget. That's why gridlock got the f90, whch has the same stats and damage model as the g36c. Good gun, but not OP.
---
You might want to consider the qualitative aspect, but at the end of the day, quicker to 100 wins. It all does a full circle and comes back to numbers. And numbers don't lie.
---
Dps is damage x rpm /60. Useless.
---
Ttk is damage that quickest crosses 100, which needs RPM more than damage. Which is why nomad's ak has the same ttk as Cap's para, despite being weaker, and Aug has lower ttk than 552 against 1 and 2 armours.
---
Cross 34 it's a 3 shot on 1 armours, touch 38 and it is guaranteed 3 shot on 2 armours as well, and cross 43 and you have a 3 shot on all armours. Anything above isn't of much relevance until you get to 63 which is a guaranteed 2 shot on all armours. Mutiply that with RPM and there you have a relevant stat that tells you how quickly you can down/kill somebody and what is your chance in combat when pit against a gun and an op.
---
Of course, all this is irrelevant as you climb up the ranks and get deeper into the headshot meta, but here, ttk translates to RPM which translates to higher headshot percentage.
---
&gt; And I'm talking about defender ranking of guns, since the argument is about theoretically giving a 2nd attacker the G36. And in naming the "best attacker guns" you avoided all the highest damaging weapons like the F2, the R4C, the C7E, the m762, etc. You're still comparing operator weapons on the same team, you don't have the option to pick a gun from the enemy team, so comparing guns across the different sides actually makes no sense when trying to determine what attacker gun is stronger.
---
It makes sense in terms of judging the raw killing potential of a gun and the op, and for the decision to give an op the gun in the future.
---
And it does make sense when making the choice. Like gridlock again- you either choose to win against all primaries on defense by using the f90 but lose to the alda, or win against all primaries except the alda by picking the mSAW. Same with IQ- you pick quicker TTK against all guns on defense against 1 and 2 armours, or you pick consistency with the 552 but higher ttk, or pick 50 rounds, incremental ttk but higher headshot percentage. The choice is based on who you want to fight. Something Ubi will take into account when releasing future ops. I can guarantee you that none of the top 4 will ever be given to any op in the future due to how unimaginably powerful they are. So it comes back down to 5th and higher.
---
&gt; But how does their satisfaction matter? Didn't they ban MacieJay? And then apologize and reinstate him?
---
Do you remember what that was for? Was it not something entirely different?
---
&gt;When ubi themselves acknowledges a flaw in their algorithm, why are you so eager to defend them?
---
Where have I defended anything? All I've said is that if op is telling the truth then that's beyond easy to show they've not queued with cheaters.
---
&gt;You act like ubi's satisfaction is the final say in the matter, when it's clear they accept their algorithm has flaws.
---
You're talking about multiple different systems as if they're one thing.
---
&gt;And how can OP prove he hasn't queued with cheats? He has no system to verify who's a cheat and who's not
---
If what they claimed at the start (only ever solo queued or played with the same group of friends) is true then they can easily check if any of those friends are banned. Given as they apparently cannot do this, it would seem the claim isn't true.
---
&gt;So shouldn't they prove they've done right and banned a cheat?
---
You think every cheater should be shown the evidence that lead to them being banned?
---
&gt;I feel like your entire argument lies in the crux of "I'm not the one in the situation so I don't need to answer my own questions"
---
Then you need to actually read what I've written.
---
&gt;You asked OP to prove it. He says they can't
---
Then they were lying in their op.
---
&gt;Your response is "I'm not in the situation as OP."
---
Yes, because I don't only solo queue or always play with the same group of people.
---
Ik i agree but it might have to do with when they changed the hitboxes so it‚Äôs player not cosmetic bank in health i think and we‚Äôre too lazy to change the blood

Congrats man! Well played. The c4 throw was a good call!
---
how bout some head and some fuck mr bear
---
Lesion or maverick are really strong 
---
Lesion is pretty much a must pick if he isn‚Äôt banned is ability is too good, rule of thumb I go by, on defense always have a j√§ger and lesion, two must picks 
---
Maverick is a 3 speed hard breach and the M4A4 with grip and flash hider is a laser beam. Also gets a claymore. 
---
Choose whoever one sounds more fun or fits your play style more, both super strong
---
Team Rocket's blasting off agaaaaiiiiinnnnn!

If you REALLY care about you elo (which I‚Äôm sure you do) play on a smurf till ubi implements this extra server security. Hopefully just a couple of weeks

SLAV: The revenge
---
restart if im not warmed up
---
That looks so nice. It deserves to be at least a rare
---
I play with people I meet online. If we queue up, it's most often for multiple games. Sometimes they add me and we play on other days as well. Do I know the person isn't a cheater? Not for sure. Do I deserve a ban because someone else cheated while I played with them? Should I just not queue with people who I don't trust, making a great team game like siege less social?
---
Same system as the one in place, but since the reason people queue with cheaters on purpose is to boost their own rank or MMR, wouldn't a punishment to MMR be a more "tame" solution? Like if a person got caught queuing up with a cheater, ban the cheat and derank the guy to a lower rank, for example.How much they derank is up to ubi. It's harsh, but people won't get locked out of a game they bought because of a false positive. And at the very least, ubi needs an appeal system, right?
---
oh my god I didn't even realize amaru got downed to a frost trap first, then got finished by the ashe charge... thought she just died to ashe. 
---
this makes it so much funnier
---
It's hard. They said that they are looking into it but also said that Microsoft and Sony have to provide a solution.
---
What about (Former) Secretary of State and POTUS Baldwin? As i have interpreted her Bio, her Father seems to be kind of famous. N√∏kk got introduced with Warden, but she is neither of the same Nationality nor from the same CTU as him, so Baldwin as a connection between both of them would make sense to me.
---
Nice ‚úåüèª
---
nope but thanks lol
---
We have no proof you didn't play with a cheater nor are they going to give you evidence. Ubisoft has unbanned accounts for being wrongly banned. So, if you really never knowingly played with a cheater then your ban will be lifted. They've come a long way and don't normally ban falsely anymore.  
---
As a side using your rank as a evidence isn't evidence. As hackers are in all rankes of Siege, obviously in some more than others.  
---
Also how long is your temp ban?
---
*Endless screaming in Blyat*

I‚Äôve become accustomed to playing MnK players, I used to complain about it a ton, but I‚Äôve just accepted it‚Äôs not going anywhere and ubi really can‚Äôt do anything about it.
---
now DDOSing is a goddamn nightmare, I never thought the game could get worse than when the castle glitch existed but here we are. Idk if it actually helps (they say it does) but every time I play DDOSers who hit the server off when I‚Äôm about to win I record it and send a ticket to Ubisoft support. Just gotta wait this out until ubi does shit
---
Oh.
---
Which is tactical. That‚Äôs why you check walls for spy holes and don‚Äôt stand out in the middle of a room.

I got a regular alpha pack on the same game I got the epic one. Both were black ice. It was Ash‚Äôs pistol and primary so i guess I‚Äôm an ash main now.

I really don't think Nokk is an anti roam operator. She's there to punish anchors that are too reliant on cameras. Idk why they made echo a soft counter.

Ok genius one more response then I‚Äôm going to do my Calc homework. I told Ubi that I only solo queue and play with friends whom were never banned. They refused to look into it. And obviously I can‚Äôt pull up a queue list of every game I‚Äôve ever played. Secondly, I am going to school to study law I understand how prosecution systems are supposed to work. Thirdly, how does the comparison not hold up? Give reasons don‚Äôt just make a statement. Battle eye is a purely software system look it up. The fact that you think someone sits there and reads every ban report is laughable and naive. I use insults you idiot but I also address your points therefore it is not an ad hominem [here is a reminder on the definition of an ad hominem to jog up your brain cells.](https://www.google.com/search?q=define+ad+hominem&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en-us&amp;client=safari) 
---
you completely sidestepped my point about Ubisoft having flawed software because once again to prove it‚Äôs flawed I‚Äôd have to prove my innocence which is logically impossible for aforementioned reasons. You accused me of cheating by saying you‚Äôre better than me because you don‚Äôt have to cheat. Use your brain to remember what I said.
---
Alright if you‚Äôve ever taken a logic or philosophy class you know that disproving a negative is impossible. Example: if I came to your house and accused you of stealing my cookies you would ask me for proof. But if I asked you to prove you didn‚Äôt steal my cookies you wouldn‚Äôt be able to because it‚Äôs logically impossible to. Therefore the onus is on me to provide proof for my allegation not the other way around. It‚Äôs impossible for me to provide proof I didn‚Äôt cheat but it is possible for Ubisoft to provide proof I did. However they refuse to provide such proof or clarification

&gt; I think I get where you're coming crom. So can we agree that either OP is lying or Ubi's algorithm false flagged him? 
---
Those seem to be the options.
---
&gt;I'd assume it's the latter, considering there's no real reason to post something like this on Reddit
---
And yet plenty of other people who are very clearly cheaters do post this sort of thing.
---
&gt;And at the very least, shouldn't ubi support team answer his queries, if they fully believe he's been queuing with a cheat?
---
No. Why would it be a good idea to tell a cheaters how they've been caught?
---
&gt;Also, do you believe the algorithm can false flag people at all?
---
I don't have enough information but I assume it's possible.

---
For one it ain't that deep. And two when you play online you agree to their terms. They do not have to give you proof. Ban's that deal with playing with a cheater are automated. They are handled by a real person. The lady said she looked into your case and said it was not a error. You have your answer and coming on reddit won't change the way the banning works.

I dont know if I'm super out of the loop on this one but relatively recently on console atleast there was a challenge for a special gun skin fun docs birthday and the challenge was to destroy 20 drones. If you find the time can you explain why doubling that amount was such a grind? I didnt find the 20 drones to be that hard to begin with. And if you're a Kapkan main then you got that sweet sweet sausage to make it even better
---
Yes they are automated all the research I‚Äôve done leads me to believe its automated if you have evidence otherwise than please link it.

---
Now and vodka to the mix, and you got one hell of a combination
---
Just a tip when you were checking out to see if you could plant you were aiming at feet bro don‚Äôt aim at feet aim head level I see tons of people do this and it just baffles me why won‚Äôt you aim where they come not ragging on you just suggesting
---
Praise the Lord chunka
---
I disagree, most of my kills have to be with an element of surprise or advantage now because I play with 100 ping minimum where I am and there's nothing I can do about it, so with the ping and MandK I will lose most head to head gunfights with no cover. Not to mention how they spam lean left lean right and crouch as soon as there's any action
---
I think you're reading far too deeply into someone forgetting to turn a gadget on siege off.
---
It‚Äôs a sound advice for both live and games so yes.
---
Ban
---
"Apply directly to the forehead"
---
How are they making the game worse by "reusing everyhing"? What do you mean by that?
---
I will give them some time honestly,they are developing the new game so maybe they will just take some time,better than mordahau,the devs banned me for writing a page long paragraf of what needs to be fixed,the madlads reported me and i got banned on the forums,NOW that game is a dumpsterfire
---
Thanks
---
Sound propagation.
---
What did you use to make this? Like what software or website?
---
So he can hear outside better?

Yep
---
Thanks dude
---
Change your sensitivities &amp; deadzones it will make a world of difference.
---
You would have to take the full mag, hold it while you eject the empty one, put the mag in then pick the empty one up from the floor though right?
---
Like, I assume it would be difficult to hold the empty mag, full mag and firearm all at once and let go of any and it‚Äôs a problem.
---
I got a Pearl skin for Frost‚Äôs Pistol :(
---
If the window has glass in it it muffles the sound, so if you break the glass the sound propagates more clearly so you can hear people running or rappelling near it.
---
Aaaa
---
They‚Äôre just mad they died. Their fault they didn‚Äôt check where you were hiding
---
If only I'd bought the packs and got all of Smonk's fursuit

Hello ChronicleFallenYT, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/d8tf1r/my_new_video_please_watch/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
It‚Äôs pretty entertaining not gonna lie.
---
Honestly, prep time needs another 10 seconds. Between getting rook armor, placing two reinforcements (possibly on hatches or other floors)  as well as barb wire and gadgets, there are so many ops that just don't have time to do their job, much less use cool strats like this.
---
Kapkan especially.
---
Attackers could also use the extra time to drone on larger maps.
---
I kind wonder why ppl dislike warden, i honestly hate ying and other ppl who throw flashing before breaking into the room and warden's skill gives me perfect advantage
---
It‚Äôs sad to because he is by far one of the coolest looking ops but his gadget is just so fucking bad just give that man my a p90 or at least make the whole smoke thing activate automatically like yings visor
---
They're not changing her loadout.
---
They would change her speed and utility before they ever thought of changing her guns.
---
*new and improved*
---
Is he shorter now?
---
Juggernaut? helmet for Fuze but I already have an Elite. :(
---
Honestly your play style is that of a toddler, you suck
---
With high Rate of Fire, it's a headshot machine. Just like Ela's Skorpion.
---
Heyyyyy that was my first one as well!!
---
The FMJ already has a pro skin
---
Nothing, as far as I can tell. This is just a clip of a run-of-the-mill 1v3, nothing special.
---
When i do t-hunt i can flick on every terrorist head like it was nothing , pretty much always one tap them , it's fairly easy when they almost or don't move at all and it don't really work to practice defender side because i feel like i'm getting 95% of the time attacker side t-hunt.
---
Damn...that looks good
---
...I think I'm a Maestro main on Clubhouse, now.
---
His ability is good in respect to flashes but in terms of smokes, it‚Äôs not good.
---
Mute's prep phase is a nightmare too
---
I'm using Aseprite, it's available on Steam :3
---
Excuse my poor english but what is a crash course ?
---
Yikes
---
really? a 2010 meme? you really are scraping the bottom of the barrel...
---
Just melee it...
---
not gonna lie some random person just sent a private message to me saying " Fk off if you don't like it , its only cosmetic why you are so upset with it ? go buy other stuff with ren instead of spending real money on pro league " just wow .   
---
i can see the day , ubisoft will lock the new ops tgt for a higher ren price and players will have to spend money on r6 credit to skip the grind or simply buying the season pass for 30$ the way this community reacts and respond is just fking hilarious . fortnite community has more logic and reason behind their brain and its a " Teen " game
---
?
---
You shouldn't be doing it to begin with
---
You should probably post a video.
---
Probably a new player that hasn't bought any previous packs. I am confused why its an American flag and not German for the map rework though. Can anyone clear that up for me?
---
Again, I direct you to IQ, where both pro league skins are for the AUG
---
I don't know why, but I imagined a full-auto version of the M320...
---
Stop posting these wins think there the best
---
When could you share skins?!?
---
I dont under stand what your trying to say
---
On console you can license transfer pro league skins, this new bundle you can't do that anymore
---
Read other reply
---
Same
---
I've been watching a lot of R6 content on youtube and twitch lately , but what i've seen on R6 is the best content are the ''trollish'' content , people having fun making funny play and stuff. Never really had a stream or a video that was really educational , unless this is what i was searching for. On that note , if you know any vids i could look for that has good educational content i'll gladly go watch them !
---
No thank you, now we can't share skins on console
---
Have to wait for the rework first but still gonna but this skin
---
True, if you waste a couple of shots by aiming bad at the ground (yes it can happen) one or two reloads can waste a huge amount of time
---
good for you, you can stop replying now cause I couldn't care less, I didn't make the game or work for ubisoft lol
---
What‚Äôs with the Viet Cong soldier hiding in the far right?
---
If they rework Tachanka, the game would die, they killed the best meme ever
---
And yea the skin is cool
---
Ahh thank you.
---
It‚Äôs kind of frustrating because House, Plane, and Favela are my favorites.
---
Must be a console thing, on PC it kicks like a mule and just gets in the way of headshotting as a result.
---
Black ice mp5 can't complain
---
Nope. Casual.
---
I played with my full Plat-Dia squad tho, no ash is getting inside there uncalled.
---
Always been surprised they didn‚Äôt have a system where you select what walls or hatches you want reinforced and then when you load into prep phase all players need to do is set up gadgets and rotation holes
---
It's stupid how little getting a kill really matters for points.
---
Okay, thank you; it‚Äôd be quite a rip off if it is not included in the season pass next year.
---
you can see them?
---
Oh that‚Äôs why. I should have specified it‚Äôs only ranked for Hereford theme park and fortress
---
Finding the objective, reinforcing, destroying gadgets and cameras. Playing objective.
---
They all give you great scores when combined
---
It‚Äôs like 3 wins I swear
---
Well you haven‚Äôt seen my friend play tachanka like he has done so many wins in ranked with him it‚Äôs not funny beacuse just like castle it requires a certain player to use them effectively
---
*killa
---
I didn‚Äôt say it is crazy, I just found it interesting that she was the oldest female operator in the game. Since she looks fairly young
---
I know, there's ppl that spawnkill with his lmg
---
3 days? I got it done in 4 matches
---
Sucks you got a dupe tho. I was rewarded with red white and blue for the ump. :/
---
You can't buy the bundle currently, I don't know if they haven't make that option available or what.
---
It is currently available for R6 credits only.
---
lmao so you can buy them separately now ? what happened you received so much negativity for forcing people to spend 20 $ for all of them ?  
---
guess that backlash worked
---
I killed the hostage
---
Yeah
---
I can possibly get in touch. Me and my clan have a ton of great moments. If you do, dm me and maybe we can cooperate through discord?
---
Well shit xD
---
Worth it
---
Where is the 2nd camera located
---
Are people this incompetent that in a comment like this they can't tell if it's sarcasm?
---
Top or bottom?
---
Example:Dual mags for faster reload is technically an under barrel attachment
---
&gt; Ashe
---
This is not Overwatch or LoL.
---
I was dumbfounded that those bullets didnt hit

So in regards to her speed, we both know that in her current state, the need for mobility is easily remedied by the fact that the speed boost provided by the the D50 and USG effectively ups her speed state by one.  So by changing her to a three speed, you merely reduce the transition for primary ads.  But the idea is not that she is metaphorically get caught with her pants down, its that she is built as a off-fragger, but lacks the ability to do so, as her guns are either dirt poor in terms of anything outside of stability for attacker weapons or incredibly niche.  For the six12, there really isnt much else you can do other than up the ammo count, which still doesnt really address a shotguns versatility outside of close range engagements.  Assuming that you would rather address changes be made to the FMG, then you have to also frame it under making changes to Smoke.  As it stands, Smoke is played as pretty much a pseudo-anchor (in the sense he is not a three armor with an acog).  So now, lets take the hypothetical that FMG9s weakeness lies in its damage (seeing as how rof is relatively average for smgs, and also that there has never been an instance I can think of where they changed the actual rof of a gun).  By putting the FMG9 on par with even the pdw in its current state puts it in line with the Commando 9.  So now you have a two armor with the ability to use a pseudo ar who also more mobility than most other operators filling that role.  That would be giving Smoke a lot of fragging capability, as the SMG-11 obviously isnt the best pick for engagements out of close range (that isnt to say its awful, but just not entirely reliable).  He would, in terms of anchors have two of the best weapons at his disposal for that role, second only to the Alda.  That would be a lot of power for one operator to have and they obviously dont want that to happen.  So then that comes down to secondary gadgets.  Seeing as how she was already underperforming with flashs and breaching charges, and the claymore doesnt really suit her playstyle, the only option left is to give her frag grenades, and even the sound of somebody being able to approach me without my or any of my teammates knowledge, regardless of how much info we have, and throw the only consistently lethal throwable offensive gadget to kill me already doesnt sound incredibly fun.  Not saying that it certainly will be broken, but just not fun knowing that outside of have a Mozzie (or Echo if he isnt banned), Id practically have nothing to warn me of this incoming danger.  I would love to talk about changes maybe to her gadget but I think Ill cut it short for now.
---
Question: is there any way to buy previous pro league sets, specifically Kaid?
---
Counterpoint: those who have the Season Pass will actually get a discount on these packs for the first time, and if you get a credit pack with bonus credits, the overall cost goes down even more. Sure, it‚Äôd be nice to still have a traditional option to buy, but moving this bundle into the store for use with credits has it‚Äôs other benefits.
---
Checked the scoreboard, I was on 9-14 ping aswell.
---
The power of assists. That or your a mf kill stealer
---
What‚Äôs not very good about it?
---
—Ç—Ä–∏ –ø–æ–ª–æ—Å—ã
---
one of their mods actually made a post about 3 mins ago , saying that you can buy each of them separately now for 960 R6 , guess the backlash worked cuz on ps4 its just working now dear god haha
---
Is it a limited time challenge?
---
I like the gun, airsoft im assuming
---
Don't play Smoke, am Whorden
---
short easiest solution: ssd
---
and please don't say that "it was fine on my hdd and others are fine on their hdd", this game is just really stupid, and i was in the same boat and have looked into it and the vast majority of the time the fix is an ssd
---
Ill try lol
---
I don‚Äôt believe so.
---
Are you dumb, you could always buy them separately...
---
If I buy the Tachanka Pro league set, can I also use the weapon skin on kapkan or only on Tachanka?
---
Sweets, and also his bible..
---
You cant
---
I get the 1st one is looking over the hatch but where‚Äôs the other
---
&gt;ash charge the jammer
---
If I buy it, can I also use the weapon skin on Kapkan or only on Tachanka?
---
Ok, but tbh, if I play her, I have more success with the shotgun
---
Lynx Australia mate
---
I'm verifying the files right now, I'll let you know.
---
In competitive play, you should almost always try to hide / save your prep phase drone. It's a huge waste to destroy that second drone for nothing.
---
Sheilds are pretty much useless at this point in time
---
I think you need to enter a code that comes with it
---
Hello yeeyeeuniversity1, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/d8vfzm/ubisoft_challenge_broke/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Same I only play her for the memes. And the staple gun is indeed meme material.
---
I don‚Äôt remember names but it is not the meusoc or r4c
---
But higher chance to hit the head cause more bullets
---
You have no idea what all i tried to get pro league  Lion that i missed because I'm dumb fucker.
---
Damn :c
---
I got a skin for the Russian LMG. I don't play Fuze much (or have Finka), and even if I did, I already have Black Ice for it.
---
Nope, the *extremely* fine movements of the reticle are fairly obviously mouse. The movement seems to be on a keyboard, though I‚Äôve seen some really good movement from controller players. But you can tell from how the reticle moves in little tiny amounts when they‚Äôre idle.
---
How to solo defend kitchen hatch against Silvers that feed all of their hard breaching to a Maestro cam before deciding to take care of it
---
yeah you can use it on kapkan, its the same gun.
---
Why did I even buy the elite skin!
---
lol, yeah I just read his reply. And someone was in there trying to defend his sorry ass as well.
---
Look on the bright side you can‚Äôt get team killed by anyone
---
Sorry but no u
---
Monty is AMAZING if you know how to play him.
---
Literally had to turn the music all the way off for this event.
---
Goyo is the best attacker I‚Äôve seen so far I think he‚Äôs better than fuze
---
Nahhhhh, I have two eyes and neither work soooooo, I'm right
---
I don‚Äôt. I just heard that they are horrible sorry if they‚Äôre still useful
---
No. At least I don‚Äôt think so
---
nothing can be done if you lost your setting you just have to remember them
---
Gameplay wise mozzie is as high as kaid playing so...
---
For real, I was both super angry and super excited when this skin got leaked. It‚Äôs so good.
---
&gt; Unless multiple people report they were disconnected at one time and cannot reconnect,
---
Unless they just take down the bloody server rather than wasting time individually attacking the other team. 
---
Almost all of the attacks are DDoS attackers not DoS, People just hire online bot services. No one is taking down servers by DoS attacks using their personal internet connection.
---
So if the code was already used it wouldn't work anymore right?
---
depends on elo  i would say
---
He‚Äôs probably on a budget or something
---
That‚Äôs a surprise. Blitz used to be busted. Did they nuke the ADS or something?
---
Doing a 180 with two strokes? On a controller? Nah
---
Yes by a lot now it‚Äôs super slow
---
You have to double check the left, mid and right thicker parts of the reinforcements. sometimes they need a little bit of extra burning.
---
Big brain
---
Silvers is a bit too harsh, it was unranked vs plats  and high golds, I knew some of them from matchmaking (weu xbox Plat elo isn't exactly huge)
---
Lego Montagne doesnt exist...............................OMFG
---
But again, it‚Äôs barely a higher chance
---
All ops in game are 6ft
---
What an awful thing to do to the barricade man, he was just minding his own business.
---
r4-c and glaz gun
---
Good Luck in College
---
Uhh just know that there is a DDoS problem right now, but they're gonna fix it soon.
---
I should have this (on Ubisoft‚Äôs own stat tracker it says I have the penetration kills, which was my last one) but PlayStation dicked it out my hands. Was pretty disappointed tbh. Anyway, congrats and good luck in college!
---
Can you do this with an Xbox
---
We‚Äôve seen this already
