Yeah I’m looking at your work again and you put great detail in the wall textures and other minor things not everyone will notice and I yeah I agree I might not be _that_ dedicated. Good job.

---
That's lag mate, on your end I think 
---
Rook mine btw
---
it definitely is not, there is a reason it was removed from PL
---
Fuck off with that
---
Nah its cool
---
The community is so bad man, some of the comments on the post are bad too. 
---
i feel your pain. last black ice i got was a duplicate, but not only that, dupe for a gun i don't even use.

Something similar happened in a final killcam on kafe with a mozzie. He got fragged and clipped through another wall
---
Oof
---
Fuze mains come get your holy water lol 
---
I like it a lot.

Lag on your end bud. The red icon shows that your connection dropped

This is a skin lol

No

I would like to know how you found this, this is, this is just completely fuckin EPIC!!
---
They should give all yhe acogs they took and put all of them on cavs pistol.
---
Exactly why I'm switching to PC. Immature little children.
---
Ok but what does that mean. It’s pretty unusual for people to just go nuts. Usually it only happens if you make a bad play or look clueless. 
---
Username checks out
---
3 words, *speed is key*
---
It's happened to me more times than I can think. I learn of these things through enemy players killing me from them haha.
---

---
Its how 8 learnt to spawnpeek with TACHANKA in certain places on some maps
---
Keep playing ranked. It seems youre above your intended rank. You will most likely rank down due to being lucky during placements. Eventually your rank will stagnant and youll be in the rank youre supposed to be in. From there your tactics will (hopefully) be even with other players. And then you can start learning what ranks directly above you do and you can either climb or stay where you at. Its how most comp games work.
---
Lmfao fuck i forgot
---
I just completed all of mine as well yesterday. Congrats I know how much of a grind that protect hostage on T Hunt is.
---
I'm a little more experienced but I have the same problem.  Idk man. I never do that well I'm placements tho
---
I was Second he was first.  I clutched and missed a couple rounds the first time, that's the story. 
---
Because, while some of the new legendaries (and plasma pink) are admittedly nice, most legendaries are garbage, since the alpha packs only money making purpose is to trick people out of renown (so they cant spend it on new ops and need a season pass, or buy seasonal skins with credits)? At least its a repurposed epic from different operators.
---
The spetznas legendary VSN SMG has the legendary skin "Politsiya". Which is  also a **rare** skin for their SASG shotgun.

Drax on the fridge

There's probably YouTube videos of this somewhere, but I learnt of this from a casual game where a cav made her way up there and I watched her with my drone 
---
So your a mnk user on console?
---
Ya I learn a couple of things from enemies too, that's how learning strategies in siege works, or coming up with them your self
---
Well, this is incredible. I have never seen this
---
Nice job!
---
He is not me that’s why I sent him the pathetic message.
---
I'm gonna start using it. Thanks!
---
Play in 5 mans, then you can do really silly strats, it’s great

Capitao needs something in his life after ubi took his rework away.

So he’s the mnk user on console?

Mmmmmm..... Make the background Spetznaz red, and try to copy paste the old grenades into a new iteration, that might make it look a lot more familiar while also being different.

I won't if you won't?

I like it
---
I’m always willing to prove people wrong. My PSN is Gado_DeLeone if anyone wants to do some ranked. I’m on 11pm-3am CST.
---
I personally would recommended maestro, his shotgun is so cool, and his cams can be really good if used correctly, which is shoot them and then look away
---
Any choice is a good one imo. 
---
Isn't it supposed to look like some rifles from Alien
---
I got mine recently, congratulations and it's finally over.

You said before I could.
---
How observant of you
---
I too enjoy committing war crimes
---
They haven’t added reverse friendly fire yet or anything new what?!!!!??
---
I’d talk to Ubi support about it. If not, then it might have something to do with your PS4. And if that’s the case, then call PSN support or they have a live chat option. 
---
If you play with literally 1 other person then they can't kick you
---
Thanks I'll try that.
---
xbox casual has gotten super toxic for me recently. i couldnt find 1 match where people werent either vote kicking or teamkilling me. the most infuriating was when someone just kept throwing their fucking gadget at me.
---
I sometimes message people Bible verses.  
---
makes more sense than the normal one
---
Fucking shit this is cathartic
---
I love playing Kaid
---
I used to play him with his shot gun got annoyed with it so I started to use his aug. I got annoyed with it too so went back to his shot gun and I fell in love with it. Shot gun with silencer is OP AF

Hell yes where do I buy

The money dick
---
A week isn't enough time to get that good at seige people dedicate a lot of time to get that good getting to gold 2 or 1 in you placements would mean you are ready to be plat or diamond advice keep at it learn maps don't always go for the kill wins mean more plants give you the power to hold an angle or take control of the situation bomb is the game mode you should be playing if you want to get to a plat or diamond skill level make friends of higher rank and learn from them if they say you fucked up learn don't get angry
---
Maestro.
---
I disagree with it not changing the outcome considering it came down to a 1v1 but thank you I didn’t know something that broken was in custom. 
---
That’s insane actually. 
---
Dokkaebi’s two-round slug shotgun in a 1v5 on house. That was a fun time
---
just a monitor and keyboard recommendation would be nice, interested as too why you recommend a wired mouse over wireless?
---
Didn't you just ask this sub which op would you want in place of the American ops?

Git gud. And if you want to solo "que" then

I really like that name! Well, there's a lot to do before it'll become playable and I'm doing it in my free time so no release date yet. But you guys made me very motivated so stay tuned for future updates!
---
Yeah, okay, but have you considered *getting good*?
---
I actually had this exact thing last night, but on both maps I played (I don't remember what they were). The sound either picked an ear, or it came out of the opposite ear it should have. I also didn't have any sounds when in the drones or for replays. I figured I just needed to reset the game because of something on my end, so it's nice (or not nice) to see that this is experienced by other people. 
---
I bought it just for Gold. No regrets. I used to run Cobalt and Emerald on every gun, now I use Gold on every gun because god damn it is sexy

Only on controller-supported platform.

Wait a sec.
---
So the only thing common between all ops are the heights?
---
Nice, shields could be more consistent and client side debris is still a thing, but other than that good
---
Those are still in the works, I don’t think they’re even in TTS yet. Those demonstrations were just to show what to come in YEAR 4 , not season 1. Just to clear misunderstandings 
---
these Ash face posts are so funny AND original. they aren’t posted numerous times every day or anything 
---
Keep us updated on it! This looks really interesting. What language are you coding this with?
---
When you break a barricade and the broken piece remain stuck and gives away you position and next thing is a headshot by a toxic ash main.

Not only on this place. Every map has a place in plain sight where no one would notice.

Great now I have to stop complaining.

I am simply informing

Hell the only non-gun skin item I've gotten is the iron mask, and I'm not one bit disappointed.

It's known since last season. A couple of r6 glitch youtubers made videos about this issue.

What's the problem?

look I like fuze shield but when I want to not sweat for a moment in my life I play fuze and the fact you are getting so pissed off about this is just childish both ops have the gun so what's the issue

Awesome I really want to play it!! Any chance it will be on iOS?

Oh casuals
---
found this on one of twomad's videos, i thought it was pretty hilarious

Very nice.

Gridlock in her art is ripped, Gridlock in game is completely fucked, even when it comes to the face grease/oil. It’s sad bc Mozzie’s model is really good.

I'm deaf in one ear. I wear headphones but I prop my right foot up on the subwoofer (which is on always) so I can feel directional information to my right. My sub is hooked up to the right channel. I just hit plat 1 tonight on PC.

I love the LMG so much. I understand why people hate playing against it, but it’s so satisfying to listen to it pour bullets out.
---
Happens a lot on PC. Much of the guys I play in the top 1k employ such features.

/Vi663R coming soon to a char near you

You are going to scream a lot the first time it happened in game too.

---
I want it!

The system was changed on February 12^th. No edition comes with base operators now.

U deserve gettin called trash. Dont play ranked if u dont know the game
---
k but what if an enemy is right next to/in front of/behind a teammate?
---
Oh... sry:(
---
But I shot him in the head first
---
I expected skyrim.
---
Ahh a fellow main
---
Ok this is not a joke, when i play ela i use ironsight and suppressor. Dont know why but it just works
---
That would be a great addition. Would like to see if or when the update for it releases. Thanks
---
Place your Grzmot on top of the doorway and hide nearby. Easier than Mac&amp;Cheese.
---
&gt;But it's just a game, isn't it?
---
No.
---
I feel some of the operator videos provide no context for their ability so yeah these are good
---
I keep one grzmot to throw in a mid gun fight, hella clutch
---
So that they can keep their delusions that their main is better than ours. (And to reduce teamkilling because of main op being stolen)
---
Technically it's the seventh, but he's referring to Ash (who's actually Israeli), Thermite (Texas), Pulse (North Carolina), Castle (California), Blackbeard (Washington), Valkyrie (California), and Maverick (Massachusetts).
---
No, for some reason every screen shot it saves is black, I also trip windows snip and sketch and windows key+print screen... Idk why they won't work
---
_uh oh_
---
Swindle me papi
---
I swear Ubi has talked about preventing people of certain ranks partying up but just never implemented it.
---
The worst thing is on Xbox ranked is less toxic my casual MMR puts me with diamonds and platinums when I'm a mid gold player on ranked it's toxic so I'd rather spend 30 minutes playing on ranked in solo than casual.
---
Its fucking not. Tho i play on pc and not with controller which honestly sucks ass
---
Give me The Lord
---
I swear I’ve taken my leave of this game for that exact reason. Like I have it down to a science that my first game solo will result in either getting tk or vote kicked, anything after that will either be a mix of sweating or half stacked teams until eventually I’ll get right back in to a lobby or tkers and insta vote kicks.Just the other day I was playing my first game of this season and I was left with clutching and of course I get 3 kilos but I potatoes the last dude resulting in an instant vote to kick. 
---
Now let me present to you the five thousand other posts exactly like this 
---
I’m disappointed that no one talks about skins during operation Velvet Shell. They still look fascinating to this day.

Can u gimme high quality link for my new desktop wp 
---
Not a clue mate sorry 
---
Facts bigger than gridlock
---
It’s so frustrating, I just feel its for people who’re to bad to actually play on pc. Ubisoft / Xbox really not to stop this from working or either officially support this and segregate the matchmaking for controller / m&amp;k
---
ChArAcTeR MoDeL iS JuSt CoPiEd fRoM BrOkE PrOtOcOl
---
No worries, I'll test it myself
---
Yeah I am. Play that shit on PC with a fair playing field. It’s an unfair advantage and is wack. 
---
[removed]
---
I would love to know what program you use for this.
---
Its called preferences
---
So your opinion is completely invalid 
---
It is true, if you use a mouse and keyboard on console it’s cheating, unless you have a disability that doesn’t let you use a controller, ITS CHEATING
---
What? Do you mean PC sucks or controller sucks, btw I’m also on PC
---
Nani
---
It’s crazy! I’ve seen so many smurf accounts this season though it’s not even funny, the whole ranking system just seems out of kilt this season. 
---
It cuts out before that fridge thing I took it into account and decided it was better off without it. I probably won't go back and change anything but I appreciate the criticism 
---
F
---
No it’s called an unfair advantage. Fuck preferences. Again, IF you prefer to play with mnk play siege on PC. 
---
you had a good luck + jackal got a badluck = 🤯
---
Just downloaded the game while it was on sale (been wanting to for a while) and I can already tell I’ll be dealing with this stuff for a while, while I figure out what I’m doing lol
---
I am level 32 and I honestly find casual easier and more fun than newcomer.
---
We need to fix the issue where in ranked you don’t have the option to pick up the diffuser 
---
HES FUCKING BREAKDANCING AS ROOK!

It’s not just an urge

Magicavoxel, free and easy to pick up but hard to master

9. IQ

10. What?
---
11. Yeah Pulse/Hibana Finka/chanka Twitch/cav and IQ/Valk in my fan-fic 
---
12. Recruit
---
13. Rook
---
14. Most likely 
---
15. No but play it anyways just in case.
---
Ya like gu needles
---
I find ranked more fun because I play with level 100 people so I'm put into casual with people that level so I get kicked immediately, so I have to play ranked to have a good time 
---
Not everyone can get a PC. 
---
🤔🤔🤔

Idk whats wrong with the supressors... i reached diamond 3 times and always used them...

Just no first seige didn't allow for mnk to work on console but instead you all but the adapter that least you by pass the feature so you can hook up for stupid mnk on a console key word console and ruin everyone's fun your not Kool it's fucking annoying and pain in everyone's ass
---
Exactly because it's not my first shooter doesn't mean I am a smurf
---
Noice
---
No dude, she’s DUMMY thicc!
---
I'm fine if they add vote to kick back into ranked.
---
The friendly fire reflection is awful for the gameplay.
---
Imagine a scenario with Fuze and Ash, Ash runs into site while Fuze's charges are going off, sure Fuze dies but the important person is the Ash who is currently fragging the enemies who had to reposition away from the cluster charges.
---
I agree, there needs to be a better reporting system for toxic individuals, I feel like the it's good but could be better.
---
I don't think kicking someone for friendly fire damage would help the more casual players, I totally understand the frustration of getting shot down to like 30HP by this toxic individual, but I feel like the reporting system just needs to be adjusted to help persuade people to not be toxic.
---
Obviously, this is an extremely tough issue, I don't think it can be completely solved, but I do agree they need to do more overall. 
---
just shoot the wood beside it and then it will drop
---
Because it'll work when they're dead, I assume
---
Fun Fact: This Icetea is sold under an other name in Switzerland because "Fuze" means "Cunt" there lol.
---
They sell it now as "Fusetea"
---
Both this season and last season my friends got put in games with 2 diamonds and 3 plat 1/2's... were all gold 1/2 except for one plat 3😬
---
*barely* legal
---
I figured that would be the case in most places yeah. But in this one, the security is a bit lacking, being a third world country and all that. The country’s airports are even in the list of the worst airports in the world. (I would know bc it’s where I live lol) But thanks for the tip! I’ll be sure to keep that in mind esp if I ever go overseas.

I did enjoy this, but having to solo queuing on this was so fucking horrible. If your teamates didn't know what to do it ruined everything. I spent countless hours replaying the same missions over and over just to get all the charms.

Nah she looks way to attractive to be gridlock. You need a picture of fat Tom cruise, that is gridlock

For a diamond player, they have a very average score, considering they went up against silvers. Definitely boosted.

Well i was Gold or Silver then Solo qued, as you know from Silver 1 to Bronze 1 there is about 5-6 matches, i had to leave two of them because of teamkilling and 2-3 others went to hell because of teamkilling and trolling.
---
I reached Gold 4 the other day now and nearly lost it because in next match 2 guys in my team were teamkilling me and my freind. Currently im Gold 4, but should be Gold 3 since i have won 4 matches on a row and not ranked up, i even got 0 points for one them..

terrorist hunt hasnt been updated ever

Don't stay on cams for minutes at a time, exit out then go back into cams every now and then so you can hear what's going on around you.
---
Which server are you playing at? It would be kinda sad if you're from America and I am here sitting in Europe^^
---
Coming from an Aussie this annoyed me to the moon and back
---
I need teammates 
---
95 percent of ideas people have for new ops are usually bad 
---
I saw someone with a 9.8 w/l ratio and a 1.7 kd last Friday iirc. It was a very confusing time for me lmao 
---
Get cleaning!
---
Thank you for the support! Yeah, Frost is a nice defender, and she looks really cute too!
---
Hopefully will be fixed in next patch
---
I've never seen those doors barricaded 
---
I missed this so much I think it was a good idea to put attacker’s and defenders together it just put a spin on the game that was so fun.
---
There already is one, lone wolf terrorist hunt. 
---
I really have no idea why I still can't tweak operators for longer than 40 seconds when I'm the only one playing.
---
Have you tried setting your headset to default output and your mic as default input in your audio setting in windows 
---
Great advice
---
OH THIS EXPLAINS EVERYTHING .... i feel bad you dont have a personality bro ... you think you’re funny , you’re a robot 
---
What do you do besides play video games
---
Whoooo! 
---
Good to see you’re a looser
---
Vigil in black ice would look sick, jus saying :)
---
That's a pretty good idea but it would be confusing for new players
---
So now your attacking my completely unrelated posts? Wow... Just wow
---
That laugh lol
---
Solid ace! Smoke is an underrated operator
---
People who din't give any callouts  &gt;  Anyone who give wrong callouts
---
So?
---
Also, that's why downed players don't die to single flash or valk cam that you throw directly at them, since they deal 5 damage, and you have a hidden health bar while you are injured.
---
Honestly he’s just a pro player but is really miss understood he can’t frag but he’s good at communicating or he got a friend with a dank gaming chair 
---
&gt; create a class
---
Ew
---
True. But we complain for this don't we? And rightly so imo. 
---
I did this to fuze once haha he ended up TK twitch..
---
Lol i lost a 1v2, accused of trolling cuz i lost it and then teamkilled and had to leave match, this was in RANKED. I recommend just getting used to it or actually having 4 freinds to play with. You can add me if you play PC and EU, Rank is Gold 4, KD 1.1.  Try R6 discord to find others, beware of trollers tough.
---
Definitely but it's nothing adding some more variety/ missions couldn't fix. I'm extremely disappointed and blue balled they didnt add in the space alien Russian cosmonaut boss battle.
---
She be thicc as hell, I love her.
---
You see, I understand that the game can't identify that you are doing call-outs and that adding a system that ranks you based on your individual performances would make people be more selfish in a team based game, but as I said in my post, especially on EU servers there is an issue with language barriers, 90% of the time I'm playing with people who can't even understand me telling them things that could've prevented them from being killed, example:
---
*Yesterday I was in a match with a squad of 4 Russians, I could tell by their connections and usernames that they was Russians, so I was seemingly the only person who speaks English on my team, because it's EU servers why wouldn't I be? Russia is in Europe, so they have the right to be in the same match as me, I can't complain, can I? I tried doing call-outs and for the team mates; a guy playing Vigil is on the second floor of Bank in the CEO office, I see a Blackbeard headed his way, so I promptly enabled my push to talk and said " Vigil, Blackbeard is headed your way from the back stairs." An adequate and short call-out so I didn't clutter up the game audio with the sound of my voice, to which the Russian responded in his deep raspy voice with "Shut the fuck up, fuck your mother" then I watched in the camera to see what transpired between the two, Blackbeard breached the wall towards the back side of the CEO office, and Vigil was shook by the explosion, it disorientated him and made his aim very unstable, Vigil tried as hard as he could to stabilize his aim, to no avail the Vigil couldn't stabilize his aim, and he was promptly put down but not out and then the Blackbeard pulled a breach charge out of his ass and placed it on the floor next to the Vigil and humiliatingly blew Vigil up, he didn't understand my call-out and was oblivious that anybody was even up there with him until the first explosion, in which case he became panicked and couldn't kill the Blackbeard.*
---
The above scenario is why I would like to be graded on individual performances more than as a team because sometimes you just don't even need communication with your team mates because they won't understand what the fuck you're saying, and that's how 90% of the games I have played on EU servers is like, because I'm constantly solo queuing.. but I am not going to do LFG posts because as stated in my original post, I have had bad experiences with LFG posts and I have autism and anxiety, so I'm not entirely one for talking too much, I only talk when I feel it's necessary.
---
They do because ppl in this game are stupid and childish. Since they can't think for themselves, they do because everyone do. 
---
Add me if you wna and play PC and EU, rank is gold 4 and kd 1.1
---
For context I'm Lv 100+ I carried myself to plat last season, I didn't just get the game, that's a joke.  It's just toxicity. 
---
waiting on nR and G2
---
I mean you can add me if you are actually looking for people, Pc, Eu, Gold 4 and KD 1.1
---
We have what we have. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I was joking, if they really make the game lag because you're playing too long they'd be cutting their own flesh.
---
Sorry if that didn't came through.
---
Would be nice to edit the load out in the firing range.
---
Thanks person.  I'll keep it in mind.  I got like two more matches anyways.  Wish me luck. 
---
she is

C7E has underperforming range

I use Ela quite often, I always use her shotgun, it’s insane, wait for the late flank and retake

He was released with Coastline, which is on and island. The only silent way to get there is to swim underwater.
---
Is the Jager ads necessary to get onto the second shelf? I've tried getting onto that but not successfully
---
Haha, it sounded kinda strange but tbh your answer made me think. The latest update is the reason why this is happening, i was playing with a friend at the end of s3 and it was a very smooth experience.
---
The Lord can’t be stopped, even in death. 
---
yeah the neck and head area doesn't match with the rest. apparently there's a head gear to go with it which probably looks better
---
He’s nerfed because of pro league, in most casual situations he’s not that good 
---
Looks like Minecraft
---
What buffs
---
Ive had several computers over the last 5 years and never has v-sync done anything but give me input lag and shittier frames
---
100% accurate. 
---
Yep that would be a better idea really.
---
I don't think the witchhunting rule applies to YouTubers so there isn't anything wrong with calling this guy out but you need to let people make up their own mind about unfollowing or whatever else.
---
It didn't look quite as i wanted it to be but didn't wanted it to go to scrap so finished it. Didn't do the flag because it's hard to do it properly and i don't want to make it look bad bc it's a great flag :)
---
It doesnt really help in this situation, but League of Legends and Overwatch has far worse community than this. There is room for improvement in Siege regarding toxicity that is for sure. Until then I would say use the teamfinder sub and/or Discord to find decent people to play with. 
---
SCHMETTERLING! KRANKENWAGEN!

Hilarious audio 😂

Wait, that’s illegal

I'm in a school and at least for me, the cams here look really similar to the r6s one, a bit more round, and without the white/red part, and whenever I'm walking in the halls I daydream a team of 5 ops rushing into the school shooting out each cam
---
Bloody Sunday had that much of an impact on them huh. 
---
Appreciate it!
---
LOL, lt seems you are playing on the East Asian server? Well that's a totally different story. That's indeed one of the most toxic community out there.

Heh lmao, thought this would only get around 100 upvotes.

Lmao sorry I’m busy

game is trash

I just try to show some appreciation back! :)

He'd be a good roamer imho

&gt; is it a type of ban or am i retarded.
---
I wouldt say the latter, but it's the a ban. A 'wifi' ban doesnt exist.
---
Clearly potato 
---
Thank YOU then.
---
:D
---
Disagree. The internet is beyond reasonable control. Videogame is a paid service controlled by  a service provider, so they control the environment and they could possibly do something with that. Tobaco companies used to blame anything but them, the same is here as long as some smart US lawyers see a business in litigating damages for suffering and psychological problems caused by tolerance of toxicity in video games.  You pay for the game and you have a right to be respected there. Just that simple. 
---
[Mouse and keyboard](https://youtu.be/fXE1n7LQGgI) (video). Am I wrong?

Still have that apex charm equipped anywhere I can 👉😎👉

That’s a shout actually

That's an assist tho, could still trigger off just the damage dealt to Jackal's teammates

Simply won't happen

I think you're a few 'o's over 'cringey' there mate..
---
justconsoleproblems
---
Oh nice, dumbasses still didnt fix the game freezing when joining a session.
---
I have no clue it has never worked for me and this is one of the reasons I’ve stopped playing siege it’s impossible to play without a full 5 man because of team killers and complete toxic behaviour from own teammates, they should have that if you try do damage to a teammate it ricochets and instead does damage to themselves.. sadly siege always gets ruined by these toxic players who think they are funny

Hello Pritchett50, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/b2wxg5/glitched_out_game/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

Will it be possible for you to make a pulse and maverick wallpapers too?

Finally some good news

Ok I guess my SUBJECTIVE opinion on this is clearly wrong according to you. If you know so much who do you think should be reworked

---
Is r6s using the proper input device?
---
If so check the voice activation sensitivity and lower it if you have to.
---
Go into t-hunt with a friend to try out various options.
---
In Plat/Diamond, fuze's pick rate is lower than Castle' s pick rate, but fuze's win rate is higher than Castle's win rate. I'm literally taking this from stats when skyscraper was still in ranked.
---
Where is the evidence that it works if you are a popular streamer though?
---
This is the exact same with me but I get I so much less
---
Just fuck off now, how can my friend refund the game now? Youre losing a lot of players.
---
Sledge's german name is Zlatko.
---
I’ve gotten tked and vote kicked because of my accent on multiple matches. I’ve even met people new to the game who don’t use their mic because of their accents, and I don’t blame them. These days I only play ranked because you can’t get kicked at least 
---
Theirs a balance of realism with gameplay and fun.
---
What fun would it be not being able to kill someone by shooting their foot. 
---
I may have opened 75 alpha packs in ~600hrs...
---
In gold+ I would bet
---
What? No.
---
Well the lean problem isnt a problem for me since I have a elite controller,yes i know 99 percent of people dont but meh it was a good idea i suppose 
---
So if I already have it it’s for every gun?
---
&gt;Ok I guess my SUBJECTIVE opinion on this is clearly wrong according to you.
---
According to the reasoning you're giving, yes. Why do you think saying it's your opinion makes any difference? Can you show why you'd not bring Thatcher when you can bring Ash and where the casters all echoed this?
---
&gt;If you know so much who do you think should be reworked
---
Why is that remotely relevant?
---
Because people don’t seem like pve content. Alexandre Remy explain it in 6:15 https://youtu.be/CJymUCQ0SKI
---
I rarely meet toxic players, but it's mostly just people calling me gay or the usual fuck you, fuck off, shut up, noob and whatever original they can think of lol. Once I've been told to go finger myself because he "insulted me" but realised I was a woman so his insult didn't make sense.
---
Define what you mean by 'clear'?
---
Most people want want surround for directional purposes
---
omg thanks a million!

Custom load out on recruit would be nice. Mine would be ATK AK-12/AR-33 / 44-Auto-mag
---
and DEF MP5k-MP5sd/ 44- Auto-mag  
---
Oh you're talking about ranked. Fuck gold, and no.
---
The general consensus for this entire community is that if you take these ops all at once, then you have 0 honour
---
Yeah bite me
---
No,my point is for example frost and buck and every previous operators' gun have black ice.But not BB Valkyrie and the others.I'm saying ubisoft could made skins for bb valk and others that's my point.
---
Why are you using MnK on console.
---
Cheater.
---
Because that’s what the title says. Not argue with the person asking the question
---
Claymores dont work like that...
---
It was beyond broken at the beginning.
---
&gt;Also seriously Ubisoft you say siege is realistic.
---
No...
---
The chaos god's approve of your worship
---
What two bad boys?
---
Oh
---
&gt; Why would you bring a BB over other fraggers
---
Because no other fragger (except **maybe** Glaz) can do BB’s job better than him: holding sightlines and advancing forward while being protected.
---
&gt; *Nobody brings thatcher when you can bring Ash*
---
Because apparently they specialize at same exact things.
---
there is a blitz shield skin challenge coming
---
You been playing a bit too much of mwr ey?
---
My computer and ps4 are hooked up to the same monitor so
---
I live in Melbs and I don’t ever really hear it.
---
I think it’s more of a northern or central thing.
---
While I do think Blackbeard’s shield needs buffed, I don’t think it needs one that’s too large. Headshots are an integral part of the game, you can’t have an op that just blocks that completely.
---
At this point, it's an effort in futility to try establishing which game has the most toxic community.
---
Let's simply agree that Siege has a toxic community, and that it's a shame.
---
(Shower thought: Maybe the plague of lootboxes and anti-consumer practices in the gaming industry is a karmatic punishment for the raise of toxicity and disrespect in gaming?)
---
If ur getting reported for being toxic, and it keeps on happening. Why not just be toxic? Play blitz rush every round, teabag after every kill, abuse bugs and scream at your teammates and kill your teammates if they’re bad.
---
P.S This is a joke, so pls no dislike lol
---
Prob not till next week though? It's April 2nd or something. 
---
&gt; Because that’s what the title says.
---
The title is "ops that (I think) need a rework".
---
&gt;Not argue with the person asking the question
---
You didn't ask one.
---
Now can you provide a link regarding the thatcher ash thing? Or at least begin to explain what you're on about?
---
If it goes longer than 2 minutes, cancel matchmaking and start it again. Crazy idea I know
---
Des and troy charm 
---
I've done that 10 times
---
Yeah same with the vectors invitational skin. Thats the only one I got and its literally just grey with a purple stock, but you can't see the stock in game.
---
I joined a game last night with my friend and before we had even finished loading in someone was screaming the N word into their mic, this community is pure cancer and ubisoft need to crackdown on greifing and abusive players.

Just restart the matchmaking...
---
Np boi
---
Why can't instead of being banned why doesn't Ubisoft do something like GTA did if you are a bad sport player then you start getting put in lobbies with people who team kill and are toxic. This will make it so the rest of us who wanna play fair can play fair. If I'm honest all of the players who are toxic should go to GTA no matter what game you playing if you wanna be toxic go to GTA where toxicity breeds. I think you get my point.
---
Definitely doesn't work.  Just does nothing but "ease your mind" by making you think you can help the situation.
---
For every point of damage you do to a friendly you should take 2 points. But yiu cannot kill yourself with it.
---
However if you do a combined 100 points throughout a match the victims get to vote to punish or forgive. 
---
If you team kill the dead player gets a replay and can forgive or punish.
---
Punish = no renown for the match or the next x matches, you cannot gain mmr but you can lose it for the next x matches.
---
Forgive = oh well, guess they saw the funny side, no further action needed.
---
Friends playing together get to have fun and play risky, yea you c4d the last enemy winning the match but you also killed two friendlies.  Woo forgive and laugh about it.
---
ssshhh people like to complain...
---
Thanks, i will 
---
You dare? Imagine the guys without friends! Ya heretic! More options=always good
---
Oh yes, i will
---
Castle with impact nades. Run outs have never been easier
---
No Problem :)
---
Your team has been banned for cancerous behaviour
---
Hahahahahha
---
Wank off
---
I’m just going to play here on my master race pc u console plebs😌*gets wallbanged by a flying hacker*
---
Your client tells the server you have hit someone on location X.
---
How the heck would a hacker meddle into that? Unless they actually hacked your PC and installed the opposite on an aimbot on you.
---
No, this is just hit registration going full derp. Has been around since... I dunno, before Operation Health?
---
^
---
I think it let’s just not waste your time there have been times where I’ve surrendered purely as I know they have more skill than me.
---
Fixed - The letter "V" is censored in the in-game text chat.
---
Again?
---
Agreed, I haven't played for over a month, got on for an hour, left pissed off wanting to punch these brats.  
---
Rapid weight loss is unhealthy.
---
people just don't mute fast enough.  if someone is bothering you just mute immediately and move on, there aren't any rules saying you HAVE to listen to their bullshit

It is in casual.

https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/game-info/seasons/burnthorizon/index.aspx
---
Trust me, that is fair, man! I can easily agree with you, but like I said the primary point at play here is just using her with a shield and pistol only, realistically speaking in terms of proper balance. I just wanted to throw out a funny, wacky idea with that shotgun part.
---
I did learn it before ranked. I play console so test server isn’t possible unless I were to get a pc which isn’t affordable atm.
---
Favela says hi
---
Quite irony. Amazing skin for weapon which is best with her standard skin due to Alibi's gadget.
---
So what's the problem?
---
Would if done like 300 with the random I was playing with yesterday.
---
I feel what helped me play smoke good in the past was to think of his smokes as basically having a barricade on the area cause they can run through it if they are madlads but usually you have to wait for it to be clear then you can go through it. Basically just use them on doorways/entrances to bombsites in like the last 30ish seconds of the round and dont try to use them for kills
---
I tried giving callouts. Ended up being tk'd/ insulted/ votekicked 9 times out of 10. Decided that communicating in this game is worthless and muted both voice and text chat.
---
It improved my soloq experience tremendously; it's not like people ever use the chats to say anything useful anyway. 
---
r/whooooosh
---
name checks out
---
Thanks mate!

It looks like they're playing on ps4. No typing.

Fair enough 
---
X pose
---
My bD its actually an addition  20% i just checked wiki
---
&gt;did you play the road to SI playlist  
---
Yes, Recruit was disabled due to Pro-Leauge settings since anyone who would be playing Road to SI takes the game seriously enough to not play Recruit anyway.  
---
&gt;You get a few free ops when you start  
---
If you bought the Starter Edition.  Which was removed.  As the Base version took it's place.  With the old unlocks for base Ops.  
---
You know, this statement, from [this blog post](https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/news/152-344167-16/rainbow-six-siege-year-4-editions-launching-february-12):  
---
&gt; On February 12, we will be removing the PC Starter Edition, and creating a new entry base game at $19.99. This new PC standard version, simply called Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege, will be available at digital retailers . This new base version improves the former Starter Edition progression system, which converts unlocking Operators to the original base game rate – saving players up to 150 hours of gameplay to get the Operators of their choice.  
---
&gt;The new base PC edition will now have an everyday price of $19.99, with an improved progression compared to the previous Starter Edition, returning to the original base game system.  
---
Plus some =/= all.  The starter edition gave you a max of 3 per side. 3 that other players can take.
---
Red dot is better than both, no?
---
We salute you 😱
---
How is that a whoosh?
---
Kinda long. Good but long.
---
I agree
---
i'm NA 
---
I've played siege with 2 headsets, one with surround sound and one without, and they were pretty much the same, no advantages.
---
he had that since Burnt Horizon release
---
I get what you're saying but that's why they have the discovery playlist. Playing that for a few days to get accustomed to the new map is what you're supposed to do
---
Or playing defenders without the God awful defense thunt mode
---
What do you mean? Red Dot and suppressor is are the best combo on all guns
---
that's true i feel like the only way to be good at R6 is just play it and bare with it's BS that comes with the package and play with a couple friends who know everything abt it
---
Ahh hello there consoleman
---
lol
---
sadly.
---
Weapon wise Ying gadget wise Ela team play wise Doakebi
---
The neck float has been there since velvet shell? 
---
I agree I hate holographic om anything other than 552 commando or the carbine for jager
---
I got tked over a kill. But it was a kill that I got. The dumbass didnt even check if it was his injure. As a result, a TKfest ensued where we eventually lost a teammate to a ban, another abandoned, and we lost a 3-0 lead to a 3-5
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Ah, Siege.
---
If you're gonna go full copper, you gotta put on the laser sights too.
---
poor defending mozzie: i'm not here to fuck spiders, i'm here to fuck my self
---
Idk why but when using a reflex, (especially on a gun that has a high fire rate) i just feel that the recoil is a bit harder to control as i have this 'light' feeling as perceived by the low profile reflex sight. I just feel like the recoil bounces more on the relfex than the holo. But thats just me.
---
Sadly, the new update did not fix the mic issue
---
the fucking egos of the people you come across on rainbow are unreal. 
---
For me it depends on who it’s on. For defense I only use Acog and reflex (except on Kapkan and Tachanka) On attack I use it for jackal and on Ying’s LMG
---
That they put new maps immediately into ranked which leads to bugs such as the rappel through window bug being exploited when they could of just delayed the map being put in ranked until the next update.
---
Yea it would help a lot
---
The internet will always be the internet..
---
Pls send help, havent stopped bicycle crunches yet
---
I think they patched it
---
Starjumps + Bicycle crunches basically are going to go together.
---
Go to siege on my games and press on it and choose manage. Season pass should be in there ready to install 
---
Sorry but, what is a star jump?
---
where are these stats from?
---
[iOS app used](R6Statshttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/r6stats/id1296600190?mt=8) 
---
To me its just a sense that the sight blocks less and seems to be more accurate due to it being just a triangle. Especially with guns with higher fire rates, I seem to aim really well when it has reflex equipped.
---
I think before a ban you get kicked from the game but aren’t banned, with a need for manual review (gives more jobs so Yee) because my first ban was because my team decided to huddle around my breach charge (this was my first game ever btw) but I blew the charge and also killed myself
---
Does anyone actually call them star jumps instead of jumping jacks?
---
Thank you! 😉
---
Bold of you to assume I can do 10 push-ups. 
---
I think it's because the screenshot seems to be taken from a squished/compressed resolution.
---
At least to me it looks like it and the screenshot itself seems to have the whole screen in it and no useless space while it is 1280x1024 which means that the resolution OP plays with is kind of weird compared to your average 16:9 resolution.
---
So basically it's the opposite of what happens when you play with 4:3 stretched. The model looks much more slim than it should.
---
Hello glordu, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/b2yopo/grenade_broke_breach_charge_but_not_castle/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
You do you
---
 🤷‍♂️ 
---
That's not a great excuse bud. No one can expect rapid callouts every time but it does say the name of the area/room at the bottom of the screen. It gives you a compass. Things have colours.
---
I understand what you're saying but its not that hard to call out "cav east stairs", "Thatcher red stairs", "buck in stock/trading".
---
Thats not a flick
---
I could run a marathon from the rage of getting spawnpeeked
---
That makes me sad, whenever I used it it gave me about 3 free kills :(
---
sound exists
---
Damn, I'll be the plank master!
---
So you don’t see bug fixes as a reason to delay maps?
---
still give intel, ask for a drone! let them know what you can give them, who killed you and where!? these are all important things to know/pass on. 
---
Fyi I'm not calling you stupid I'm just pointing out a common mistake 
---
Haah
---
Yea a kick works. However, if you get multiple kicks in games back to back or within a time period you get a ban. If you’re not TKing intentionally, learn how to shoot, get a new mouse and mouse pad and/or see an optometrist.
---
It actually does work. I used it last night and the guy was instantly removed from the match. I do this to everyone on the enemy team to try to get a man advantage. The way I see it, if they're removed, they probably deserved it.
---
Depends on the nature of the bug
---
Genuinely beautiful, someone should show this to Ubisoft, deadass
---
But then why’d you state that you see no good reason to delay maps if you’ll agree there is one?
---
Why not just restart the game?
---
There’s always also gonna be that one guy who will try abuse it by walking infront of you in a firefight 
---
I've been playing rainbow 6 since Y1, Get plat every single season that i bother to play. Hit reg is 100% a problem right now. Last patch messed with head POV positioning and it's literally lead to client side hit detection and getting shot behind walls after peeking them, and just being close to corners in general. Your personal experience doesn't really constitute fact.
---
very good
---
I'm just living my best life man and you do the same ya crazy Clash Main  😘

I did that and somehow got to bronze 3

Dokki: Call on the push or when you found a roamer and are wanting to pin point their location in the room. Don't do the random calls when they mean nothing. 
---
Ela: Keep one grzmot on you, have fun with her shotty on obj or near bombs its honestly a ton of fun!
---
I'm not criticising your post here, but I have over 400 hours on PS4 and I have NEVER once been able to look at someones gameplay and determine that they are 110% using MnK. How do you determine they are?
---
I'm not saying it's not an issue, because quite frankly it is, but I really do feel people blow it completely out of proportion and falsely use it as an excuse after dying to someone with high sensitivity and good aim.
---
We bout to become terminators bois 
---
I would say overall not a good idea, don't really see a poi t in adding additional reinforcements or customizing them and giving weapon attachments and all that stuff. The recruit is not supposed to be able to have everything the real operators have. If they had the same amount of gadgets and attachments and alm that, there would be no reason to not pick them. Terro hunt was put in the game to be a sort of practice thing,  to test out operator specialties and all that. But I would say that giving the recruit the DLC guns  would be cool though. Not knocking you just giving my opinion. Not trying to be rude or cut you down. 
---
Same to you
---
nice shot
---
What's your in game name we'll help you if we find you
---
I mean its cool but is this really the best angle? Also, show us or give us the name come on.
---
We were talking about a specific, current, situation.
---
&gt;But then why’d you state that you see no good reason to delay maps
---
I didn't state I see no good reason to ever delay maps though. This is precisely what I mean...
---
I've lost matches because of this. It's so infuriating that I'm about to walk away from the game until they fix it

---
Those damn sweaty doc mains
---
if that’s the case then this idea is extra garbage. the only reason why they should allow native MnK support is to group MnK users into lobbies together. not with controller users. having it so MnK can just queue with controller is trash. 
---
Literally how I picture every spawn peaker ever

It would be hard considering your user and the fact that you’re a clash main lmao

Well hibanas a 3 speed and a hard breacher with a good gun, but personally I enjoy zofia more. Her gun is easily one of the best in the game, but she is a 2 speed

Zofia, she is a lot more useful and her guns are better.

Terrible quality picture, amazing skin. Want it so hard.

Well then it seems there was some miscommunication because when I read “maps” I took it as current and future.

I do like her shotgun a lot, one of the best semiautos in the game imo
---
thats cool photoshop

For the most past I agree with removing vote to kick. But the problems are stuff like afk and team damage and  I feel like some people see that vote to kick as enough of a deterrent to not do bad things.
---
They need to change tk, I know they said they are working on it but what I'd like to see is harsher penalties but also tk forgiveness. It'd be after dying you watch the replay then after the replace you can say whether it was intentional or accidental.
---
Wait a minute...

---
My experience too on xBox. Hell I get TK'd just for not clutching even if I'm top ranked on my team.
---
🥔
---
Depends on how detailed they are when it comes to implementing it.
---
An bad example would be Fuze could TK someone then have the rest of the team rush sight while he cluster charges it and same idea for Smoke on defense.
---
These are hyper specific and aren't something you'd likely ever see done but are just points to show it all comes down to how they implement it, calling it a straight improvement before it's even tested is a little early specially given the dev's track record.
---
That a lot of bycicle crunches
---
Less abusable than the current system, so it's a straight upgrade.
---
honestly I'd rather have no callouts than complete dogshit callouts that I get sometimes. too many people in lower ranks give horrible calls or are just trying to backseat game you the entire time. "don't go there," "get back to objective," "I hear him either above or below you". it's like dude shut up for a second so I can actually hear the game
---
Ow my abs 
---
What in the hell did I just witness 
---
The fact that you can forgive and decide whether it was intentional or not  is a big deal considering how Halo handled it and playing that game a lot (accidental warthog splatters were common). There still needs to be an option to report and ban griefers because there will be people now getting into your line of fire on purpose also (MW3's Hardcore Search &amp; Destroy had this problem).
---
This is his buff
---
Although I think toxic player will still find out some way to abuse this, but this is a great start tbh
---
Same for me
---
This is huge and probably the best option they could have done to solve the teamkilling problem. Really exited about this, thanks for listening to us!
---
I had a laptop with nearly the same specs. You can expect to run siege at 1080p with render scale at 50% (effective 720p resolution), everything on low except for textures (medium), LOD (high), and shadows (medium) at 50-60 fps consistently.
---
However, the one warning is that the 960m is a thermally  inefficient chipset and can have heating problems depending on the design of the laptop that will throttle your performance. I had an older i7 in my laptop that was really hot so you will probably do better, but if you really want to game I would recommend that you also lug around a thermal pad laptop cooler with a built in fan, although the design of the laptop may be better than what i had (and new so the heatsinks are clean and efficient).
---
* still gets downed by a team mate cav *
---
I've gotten &amp;\^%!@ talking because "American" is in my gamertag, bc the other half of my tag was taken. Kids talking like I'm so jingoistic asshole.
---
Overall I've gotten pretty quick on the report-block maneuver.
---
It's because you were infinitely more toxic than the guy criticizing a video game lol
---
Why the fuck are you using laser sight.
---
You seem to underestimate how dumb and toxic people can be in this game
---
Hitboxes still broken regardless of whether or not shits synced up or not. Plenty if evidence if you search for it.
---
Nah man he’s got a better gaming chair than you that’s all
---
I’d agree with majority of your comments, guys. I’m just writing below this post. It is truth that there is a problem of defining toxic behaviour and proportionality of reaction. I wouldn’t like videogames become a world of censorship, but i know more can be done. As to telling me that i can avoid toxic people by leaving, it is not a solution for me. Right to be respected is not „superficial” and I know how to deal with toxic ppl (it’s partially my profession), but many ppl don’t. And i think that RS6 looses more due to one quit of a decent guy (like apparently the one who initiated the thread) than getting rid of five toxic players. By toxic i mean really harmful and intentional behaviour (insults, TK, rasism). 
---
Yeah, it should be once a teammate has done 100 damage to you over the course of the game it should turn on, unless you forgive.
---
When you forget that you're a bitch
---
ow.
---
No me
---
Hey what platform do you okay siege on?
---
1.5-2
---
Actully see the post that just came.
---
1000 star jumps

Over 400 situps daily? Ok.
---
Never seen this art style before, so thank you for introducing me!
---
As for the photo man you did an awesome job!  
---
I don't know why but I get Halloween vibes from this piece.
---
All I’m saying is you can only control you. If people are being toxic just find a new lobby. It’s an easy solution that takes 30 seconds thanks to the fast load times. 
---
Imagine: 
---
you get spawn peeked by cav; 
---
so you do 10 squats and 20 sit ups; then
---
Later in the round, a teammates yells the N-word 5 times while he fuzes the hostage, later blaming you guys for the round loss; 
---
5 more squats, 10 more sit-ups, 15 push-ups 15 jumping jacks, 45 bicycle crunches.
---
Repeat next round
---
Something worth calling legendary.
---
I scoured the internet and haven’t found one. What is it?
---
I just play ranked or thunt, I find that casual is a breeding ground for toxicity because of how easy it is to just leave the match with no consequence. I've even had kids in casual kill me repeatedly for clutching rounds lol.
---
Crouch spam??
---
600 bicycle lunches a match
---
u/Its_Epi
---
What's it called?
---
On PC always go 83 ADS for 1:1 sensitivity between hip/ADS. Also, mostpros play slow sensitivity, but use dramatic arm movents. It looks like fast sense, but it's actually very slow. The gold standard sensitivity for Siege is usually 400 DPI, 12-12-83. For heavier mice, do the same but throw it up to 600 DPI.
---
The hip fire sensitivity for most good players is usually between 10 and 18, while mostly anybody should always use 83 ADS.
---
I think that's part of the joke
---
Great video so far 👍🏽
---
Yes and now I'm back to that rank
---
thank
---
I’ve had it since blood orchid and I’m copper 4 so you’re clearly better than me

You are on the wrong server. Make sure you are connecting to the right region.

---
Reinstall season pass, there were some complains about it at the start of the season.

Uh if you are on pc you want to keep your horizontal and vertical sens the same. I thought it was like a given lol but you get more consistent so that might be your problem. If its console eh idk I hate playing 60 frames lol

I have found some use in his gadget by pretending to use my ability too late when a drone sees me then move when the drone turns off but other than that, unless the enemy is using a calculator as an audio device they can hear where I am anyways
---
Go to all skins in the shop. Then scroll down to his weapon. You’ll see it

it is the mirror AND a forgive system, the mirror only goes into effect if you are not forgiven; pretty cool

---
I agree but it looks sick on some weapons
---
No, but Halo has a "Press X to Boot" system where the person who was betrayed gets to decide if you should be kicked or not.
---
If applied to siege you can have it so if a player starts dealing damage or kills their teammate then they have damage reflection kick in at say 50-70 damage dealt. 
---
Then the player(s) who where shot each have the option to to boot the player who shot them so much or forgive them.
---
Alternatively there should be a fixed system where if you are punished for TKs twice within 24 hours you will recieve a 24 hour ban or longer.
---
My man a true stone 4.

Welcome to the world of rainbow 6 siege.
---
Never had a group to play with. So I can't relate. 
---
what a plot twist
---
Tactical is right, and you can find her comments by searching her name on google JK Rowling comments
---
That's racist.... ;)
---
I think you should tell all other members of your team that one player is a hacker and elect one player to report and vote to kick them if that happens to anyone. 
---
Weird. Well the difference is clearly not based on K/D based on your post and my knowledge of how the elo system works. I wish I could say I knew what caused the difference (its only 5 points anyway tho, not that big of a difference anyway).
---
Dude. That's my clip that happened on stream last week lol.
---
If this has been posted before, i'd love to see where!
---
Just to cover all bases have you clicked "apply" In the settings after you finished changing them? You probably have but, just making sure.
---
I wonder if killing your teammate to prevent an interrogation will activate it. Will probably be forgiven but still
---
thats dom and how does that work I want to know how to do that
---
Sledge’s hammer actually represents his goal to destroy trans oppression. 
---
i was playing bad myself 2/8 but i see you dont get the point Sir
---
This is a wondertfil change. However, most cases of toxicity include not killing a player but downing them, either as a Cav or a Doc. If the reversal threshold could be changed to 100 points of team damage done instead of 1 team kill, it would be ideal.
---
&gt; Your client tells the server you have hit someone on location X.
---
&gt; How the heck would a hacker meddle into that?
---
Infinite health regen? Invulnerability? Getting hit doesn't matter when you can just shrug it off.
---
Anways, don't think it was a hacker in this specific situation, but wouldn't be surprised if it was possible.
---
The front door isn't broken for a Rook spawnpeek..
---
This is clearly CGI! Fake!
---
fair point my friend. i completely agree with that but then what if you’re the random with a 4 stack against a 5 stack it’s still like being with randoms (atleast on xbox where no one uses game chat)
---
Yeah I've seen it today somewhere
---
The "TTT" gives it away. 
---
I’ve joined the cause
---
This is like asking how people get to global on CS. They just play a lot to the point where their skills are top tier. 
---
Yeah a big problem with this game is that it's missing a little bit of that "Commando Lunge" like mechanic from Call of Duty to give you that little nudge to actually end em.
---
Obviously toned waaaay down from cod lol.
---
 Just so Knifing actually works ffs haha
---
Yeet
---
Let me know if you remember where, i'd love to see where it landed!
---
I showed my friends how to do that and on other maps you need to wait until action phase
---
Weird. I'm not exactly sure what could have caused the offset then. It's clearly not score or K/D that is factoring in, but I have no idea what else may be at play with the system.
---
I will search
---
I think he was going for the knife lol
---
No you don't, see the timer I'm in prep phase.
---
Because I cannot stand toxicity in this community. If you’re going to cause it, then you and I have a problem. 
---
I find that although I know tower perfectly fine I get lost when droning and attacking so that'd be great for ranked. 
---
Thanks!
---
Maybe Read the Dev Blog again... Page 2 “The player that was team killed will be able to decide to forgive or punish that player” 
---
So basically just do the whole list each game 
---
No I agree. I would enjoy having certain events, sure. But I would also accept April 1st 
---
I agree with her weapon being great but is mira really considered easy to use. Tbf im kinda newish to r6 but my understanding was since her mirrors make or break the round for the team she requires a lot of game sense to use properly.
---
Just replace his Bulletproof Camera with either  barbed wire, or nitro cell then you'd be fine. Pair that with Kaid and you can drop more electricity and even assist bandit.
---
You bought all of them right?
---
An FYI if you didn't already know, you don't need to ADS doc's pistol.  If you hover the crosshair over a teammate it turns blue if shot will connect.
---
how you   can understand most of the words  when they are in greek
---
I can make a post there if necessary, but the only game I play that uses it is R6S. I didnt know if the release of Burnt Horizon caused this for others as well, or if it is just me.

Lol true. I normally leave two near the biggest area for drone traffic (on both sites, respectively) and keep the last incase a find a drone i might want later.
---
Ok thank you
---
Exactly what I’m thinking LOL
---
Its a dumb thing to know that if someone has a lisp, and that they cant control it, especially when they give a perfectly good callout, that people will make fun of and harass that person, same goes with girl gamers. This will be the end of siege unless this drastically changes. And soon.

Ok so first of all thanks for your help. I havent tried this yet but here's an update. The update is well i changed my DNS and it slightly helped i still get the disconnect but not everytime,Even if i do connect i just try 3 times and by the 3rd time it actually reconnects me back so i only miss the first round so thats not bad. 2nd of all i have 6mb/s speed so i dont know if this will make it worst or not
---
Reflex shooter + input lag + 60 fps limit = Hard pass for me
---
That being said, I can see it being viable for other types of games where a bit of input lag wouldn't be a big deal. A game like AC: Odyssey which was shown during the presentation is a good example.
---
Sorry but rook brings the thick to the dinner table. He's a 4 armor and can only make other ops that thick

---
❤️
---
update:
---
i was 53 gigs in, and steam restarted it again.
---
Great news! As a suggestion - to add reverse friendly fire not only after first teamkill, but also after a certain amount of friendly damage applied by a single player - like 150, for  example. And the right to punish will go to a player who reseived the biggest part of it - to prevent Cavera downing and simply shooting multiple teammates.

Yup! I have been waiting for 10 min. And still not in a game, I’ve done this three times and restarted.

How can anybody explain what happened, when all we see is a killcam and have nothing from your perspective before you die. You cannot trust a killcam; they’re fucking useless.

But why bother when the seasonal skins that game with Jackal look much better than this

Haven't had PS+ for a month and just got on today and noticed, hope this isn't some glitch they'll resolve later :(

Thanks! I managed to get it!

I remember back in the first few seasons, the R6 community was really consistently nice. Before it was this huge event and most people didn't think it would survive the year. I remember joining a game, having no fucking clue what I was doing, and the entire lobby was helping me out, giving tips, constructively criticizing my mistakes and letting me know how to improve. The whole lobby, not just my teammates. What happened to us? 
---
So Saitama played Siege after all, huh?

nice

If you solo queue seige, you're gonna have a bad time :/

If the PC turns off check on the Ubisoft Forums or try contacting Ubi Support

We would all just be doing the cycle thing lul

Yoooo shout out to ubi for fixing the teamkilling problem! Been asking for this to be fixed for ages now by applying damage done to other players to be reflected to you and they did it. Ya done good ubi, keep up the good work guy!

Forgive by default is a better option. Usually after someone dies they might go do something else and not respond to the prompt.
---
I've seen it both ways, but I've also seen people say "You picked XXX op, what a bot"
---
I've also aced matches, and seen people say "Who aces with Ying? What a bot"
---
Well this kind of challenge chases more people away. 
---
Valk, the cameras allow you to be very useful while still filling a creative and sometimes crucial role to the team. Nitro, great gun (if your a good shot) because there is no recoil and it has a good fire rate and she’s a 2/2. 
---
Cav can be a good op for a skilled solo player but all around valk will be a far more useful operator with a lot more flexibility. 
---
How many do you need to type?

With Mozzie rising on the back?

Thats how the X is  on the banner

Particubes
---
Why would that be the case? Are people actually thinking “ugh this game keeps expecting me to team up to get an extra free cosmetic charm, might as well not play at all”????
---
If you don’t have friends, just... don’t complete the challenge...

I can't get the charm, and don't fancy facing a 5 stack sweating every match. I'm already taking the season off because of bugs, but this would have made me take a few weeks off anyways. 
---
Who cares?
---
This isn’t even a joke I might use this
---
No... Chubby... Ela is a THICC
---
Might just need to do squats and bicycle crunches the whole time
---
Lol what kind of attitude is that. You re not a baby. If youre shit and made me waste 20 min of my life i will point it out to you in hope i wont see you again in my team. The point of ranked is playing with tryhards. If u want to have fun and play to lose go in casual retard. 
---
Ohhh so it’s because you’ll run into more full squads, I get it now
---
You have a point
---
Most the community is toxic. Also trying to find 5 people with mics, who speak English, have the same work schedule, are willing to play this game for extended periods of time and have equal skill level are not common.  
---
I was expecting you to miss shots and act like the reflex on Glaz isn't the only sight that is completely misaligned
---
I've noticed it before but it never clicked till you pointed
---
 it out 
---
Same things been happening to me i think its just a ping problem

Contact support

keep using buzzwords.
---
I know it's possible to work around this issue by viewing the available skins for the weapon from the store instead of the operator screen. If you went to the store, then to the op screen, it would show up.
---
I know this worked if you hadn't purchased the skin. I'm not sure if you have the skin already.
---
Try going to the store page for the M249 SAW, then see if it shows up in the operator screen.

On console it just becomes cheaters galore. Tons of mouse and keyboard users and glitch abusers 
---
This will solve nothing and cause far more problems than we have now, now a team can't defend themselves from an asshat that decides to damage everyone the run around giggling like a twat. and what about a teammate that stands in the way of a door or wall preventing the rest of the team from prepping knowing  he can slap someone with damage reversal if they try and stop his "fun" 
---
Current system is abusable. Any other suggested system that keeps friendly fire on is abusable. The simple "Forgive" system the community's wanted is as abusable as this. Both involve the griefer running in front of of the victim twice. Gotta keep in mind: assholes will always find a way to be an asshole. They're creative enough. This system in it's suggested implementation at least doesn't kick you if the troll punishes you.

I was gold 1, solo'ed my last game to play. Made the mistake of telling my team that, and being the toxic idiots they are, team killed me and lost the game for us.

Copper-Silver is Smurf Land

Play - Diamond is M&amp;K on console land

Gold is as close to a happy place as you can find.

This is exactly the reason, there have been dozens of these exact posts for the past 3 weeks, I really wish everyone could understand
---
These type of posts get posted every day. Reque after 3 mins
---
Not really, that fire rare thing was a bug in the TTS, i think they never meant to tweak that, the only other thing i know they increased was the hip fire recoil was slightly worse, but you can still hip fire without much problems just not as fast as before if you want to it to hit.

I think it’s pairings of operators that aren’t effective? Anyone’s guess really. 
---
And the skin doesn't show up now under the operator screen?
---
If not, then ticket ubi support, it's a bug with the newly added skins showing up properly in the ops screen.

console still has a spectator bug. And a bug with the lean after the new changes 
---
Something similiar happend to me a few minutes ago.
---
We were attacking on "Border" and the enemy was in "Teller" (Casual, Secure Area) and only our Fuze and the Caveira of the enemy team was alive. Fuze downed Caveira but ran outside to troll, but the moment he ran outside of the objective we won.
---
I’m just glad you don’t flat out disagree. I would think pixel peaking and spawn peaking would decline by a huge % and people would finally have a reason to use the marksman rifles I think it just makes sense. 
---
Imagine the fear
---
Bruh look at gridlock and tell me that's muscle
---
This happens to me alot idk whats happening
---
although I'd agree that pc is way better community, toxic dick head players can be found anywhere.  
---
and this is my personal anecdote, but I play in seas server, and there are way less toxic people here.  
---
like, this guy said that it happens every match but I experience it like once in 7-8 matches.  
---
people on pc feels more welcoming. I even have a smurf account where I play like stupid Noobs. (no toxicity or taking advantage, just some lighthearted fun). and I meet many people welcoming of new players.  
---
again, this is only my personal experience and nothing I say is 100% true.
---
The bike should break again when they attempt to ride off. You know for... obvious reasons.
---
Yep, and think about all the teammates who just don't know until the last part of the match when restarting doesn't make sense. This issue real cuts down on player enjoyment
---
I actually did this for a few weeks and I actully gained a bit of muscle, I shit you not
---

What's the answer if you're a solo player and run into a group of four ppl who just alternate TKing you?

He has all these gadgets to play with but he chose to play with my feelings.

I could see that. But I will always see them as *neck flotations*
---
I have on Instagram. It's common. Someone did some ship art of Lion/Doc recently 
---
Wait I wanna join
---
I've played OW for some months now alongside Siege, including maybe 20-30 competitive matches and so far it's been so much better in terms of toxicity. I've seen more comms, more teamwork and lighter atmosphere in general. Some name calling and teammate bashing, but since there's no friendly fire, it's nothing to get bothered about.  
---
  
---
I think it's mostly because the game is fast paced with constant action, you have little time to observe others and come up with stupid shit.
---
Bro I’m actually gonna do this 
---
Goddamn, that thing on top of his helmet makes it look so dumb.
---
As a pc player, I've never really had a ton of toxic behavior. Sure, it happens. On Xbox though...my god. It's a barren wasteland of shitty kids trolling. Sometimes I want to slap the children in my house for behaving like little assholes in game. 
---
That said, with this hopefully you find some ppl to squad up with and can ignore the bullshit. 
---
I they ever remove or change that mechanic I’m quitting Siege. 
---
Need put stop to the "chip damage"... But good job... 
---
Uh no? It's just a skin my man

Take your own advice then. You look mighty foolish.

Adelaide checking in, never heard anyone say it until Mozzies profile.
---
I understand where your coming from but it’s a easy thing to comuter
---
The one shot headshot makes siege a very unique game, removing this would make it more like the others 
---
Maybe if gridlock wasn’t so god damn WIDE
---
Not new, but dank as fuck
---
Same.
---
it old skin
---
i absolutely LOVE the one shot head shot mechanic. one of the main reasons i play siege over other fps’ is because of the crazy low time to kill. i get so bored even in games like apex where you can totally get the drop on someone but the still win the fight cause they had better armour/guns
---
It'd lower the skill ceiling of the game.
---
HMU if you’re on pc I’ll bet we can find players to get this challenge done my Ubisoft is BaNaNA_EaTz_YoU search me up
---
Rainbow 6: The rippening
---
increase the recoil to 110% on every friendly hit by a cluster without dieing. This stops everyone
---
Where is getting kicked as soon as you join a game?
---
My alt account on Xbox is called SugarDaddy (I use it to mess around) and my friends name is PapaMochal and we see a kick start near instantly and then tk’d in casual matches (we also both use those Minecraft avatars so maybe it’s kids being edgy...) it’s still funny every time.
---
Don’t know if you got the answer already or not, but yes. Any forgiven tk will not be registered and you  can keep killing (Siege Youtubers are gonna have fun with this one)
---
Same
---
Take a look at mira or valkyrie. That is strong gridlock is just fat. Your muscles dont turn you into a big dodgeball when you're fit
---

---
No lie, last season I said "damn dropped out of gold 4, 1 game to get back in and I got all Sunday. I can do this".
---
Preceded to drop all the way into bronze 3 going like 3 - 11+ overall. The only time I wasn't top of the team were the three games I won, where I got hard carried by smurfs
---
I ranked into gold 2 this season and am currently on the way back down lol
---
if anyone trying to play together hmu pc only
---
The one headshot mechanic is the biggest thing that separates siege from most other fps out there, removing it would just make it lick any other game
---
I feel like there are alot of better deagle skins though. I would rather have that yhan2 legendary headgear when i got the elite skin
---
oh man so many bicycle crunches
---
Rules say no memes sry
---
Actually, it 99% sure is. Muscle on women looks different from men since they don't lose fat as easily and having a little fat is actually helpful when building muscle. Being muscular doesn't look like the usual bodybuilder body. In fact, many bodybuilders, while having big muscles, can't lift almost any weight since their muscles are really weak compared to someone who actually exercises
---

Same here man, I love this mechanic. But would hate to see it getting removed. 
---
And anyone who plays in a squad. 
---
Shes fat. 
---
Those are mostly people misusing the term. Also Im willing to bet the person that said the shield things is silver or lower.

Classic Ubi fixing wallbreaches that dramatically change the attack strategy on their new maps.

While I agree with you entirely. They're  just gonna go somewhere else though

Herpa derpa, you're right. XD Well pretend it's biohazard lol.

It's amazing how many people forget you actually have to kill the defuser, even I do if I'm distracted...

What’s that lava skin and how do you get it

I just started playing Siege and it’s pretty fun so far. We got it as a go to game after we burn out from Overwatch and Apex. Comp seems fun can’t wait to learn how everything works

I'm hopeful this will help the problem. Griefing is far worse this season than I've ever seen it before (PS4). I can't seem to find a match solo queuing where my team mates don't grief to intentionally de-rank.
---
I know it's partially my own fault for soloing, however I used to really enjoyed ranked. In its current state it's almost unplayable unless I find 3/4 friends to play with.
---
People in this game are so toxic it’s not even funny
---
Wait, a legendary drop that hasn’t been posted here hundreds of times??? You must be at the wrong sub. 
---
I don’t really, so how is the matchmaking 
---
Oh it does he "ubisoft" -ed you.

What do you mean

Xbox and playstation have a screen capture please use it. I used to take pictures of my TV also but it kinda make the picture garbage. Ps just trying to help
---
tried both
---
Finally black beard got an actual black beard lol
---
Yeah it’s casual... it’s not based upon rank. Diamonds can be put with coppers in casual, if u want to play against equal skilled people play ranked. This is true for all games, not just r6s
---
Molly’s gonna love this!
---
I fucken love you guys
---
Console platinum probably.
---
Like are the people usually serious about the game, or do they just purposefully fail
---
That would be ridiculously OP
---
More like bronze 
---
Pulled a 1v5 clutch on attack. Next round match point 3-0 our favor our clash was 1v1 an ash. He started teabagging in obj and missing ash on purpose. Ash stepped on a frost mat. He impact naded himself and left for good measure. Rejoined in time for next round. Tkd me and threw another 1v1. We lost that match.

Hop on the R6 Discord and pray that none of the 4 party members you'll find after 30 minutes of waiting suddenly "has to go" or straight up disconnects...

You hold up the mentality of "just one more minute" until either your mind or body gives out. I can still run about two-three minutes usually.
---
Depends what you play on
---
Ok. Ya I’ve just been thinking it looks really cool, and for sure might be worth getting
---
R6 has one of the least toxic communities i’ve played in. Its just people complain more cause more people with less experience in other gaming communities play this game.
---
Is it only me or the hit reg has also been awful
---
Idk
---
I’m a game off of play 1 on console and I I’d kill to play against someone like. 
---
Like afk or trolling? No not as much, though some people complain about toxic teammates in ranked and smurfs ruining ranked. Tbh it hasn’t been that big a problem for me personally, but then again I’m around high gold - low plat. Smurfs aren’t a problem and normally people care too much  about their rank that high. So yes, it may be a problem at the start with tking for reasons I don’t understand, but no as it gets better
---
I personally prefer Leon furioso, the purple/pink and blue seasonal that came with jackal, but they were all nice skins
---
Pc

Ok
