who and how did someone throw it there and you shoot it?
---
Oh ok. Anyways It seems pretty op to me.
---
I once trowed a c4 through the left window next to the piano and killed 2 people walking towards the police car. That was awesome. Spawn killing c4
---
why the fuck u got an intel stock cooler on some random piece of metal
---
I'm worried it will be sadly too strong. Kapkan already has a decent win rate,with Goyo and Kapkan combo being too strong,Kapkan might get nerfed for being picked too often and then also winning too often.
---
Come on man, 100 more to get the champion!
---
I really enjoyed it until the end. Been meaning to watch the movie that replaces the end.  Apparbetly their funding was cut and they basically had enough to do like 10 minutes of content so they stretched repeated scenes into two last eps and barely explaining anything that was suddenly happening out of nowhere
---
Welp, hats off to you, that‚Äôs impressive if you can pull off plays with that strategy. I usually stick to the smaller rooms, as people don‚Äôt usual expect someone to close themselves off, but I‚Äôm not the best Caveria player either.
---
If we‚Äôre doing crossovers just imagine Marcus Fenix with a crouch run ability and the primaries of Lancer (chainsaw) and Old Lancer (knife).
---
The secondaries could be gnasher and pistol maybe
---
So uncivilized.
---
If she doesn't I'm gonna skeng Yannis Mallat.
---
He clearly likes it!
---
Thanks for the free down bro
---
Did you look at the balancing comment I created? Maybe it will change your mind, you can always give a bit more information to why you think it is op, it will be appreciated :)
---
Depends on the season. But currently Gold 3.
---
Audio only...the sounds of trying to capture B flag  domination Nuketown BO1.
---
Silver, but playing on AZN servers as a native English speaker is rough
---
That would be acctuly prety neat buff for tachanka
---
So about Ela's shotgun. The Carbine is fine I agree with as it doesn't have a recoil diamond. But the FO-12 already  is one of the lowest damaging shotguns in game. It only does more damage than most at mid range but is abysmal compared to every other shotgun at long ranges. Even with a extended barrel. It's not overpowered, nor is it even that powerful. It's a God of CQC but past that it's very much just like every other shotgun at ranges.
---
i knew it wouldn't take long until someone make it
---
Shhh!
---
Nice
---
I mean, I‚Äôm already resistant.  Just not very resistant.
---
Monty's usually get bullied. This is one of those cases.
---
Im not too worried about it as they could prob make a small patch aside from changing the whole character if the strat turns out to be too strong. They could simply just make it so kapkan could not put his bombs in doorways in which goyos shields are in.
---
Yeah,i see many cav players sticking to smaller rooms but cav is also very effective in bigger rooms. Like mentioned,the shotgun can be used to open every hatch at the top floor of Hereford. I hardly see any teammates roaming there to protect objectives like child bedroom meaning if i hear someone else on the top floor,i know that it is an attacker. And then i have 3-4 hatches to drop into different rooms and surprise enemies too.
---
You still did a great job
---
Plat2
---
Lol you're afraid of an f2 nerf. You also rely on maestro who quite literally has one of the best defensive weapons. I definitely don't need you advice seeing as you only use top tier ops to win. (Btw learn the difference between "good" and "op" I never said they were overpowered I just know you don't like challenges)  Taking a moral high road isn't going to help you bud. Also I've made my own opinion and it's that clash would be a better attacker over a defender.
---
Bow with Fire Aspect 2?????
---
I only added the damage nerf as a change to the less recoil of the smg.
---
This would make ela players choose between a strong semi auto shotgun at close range or more of a smg at longer distances.
---
Low-key most R6 gun skins are ugly.
---
Oh god yes. Id have a hayday.
---
Ooooo, smart! üßêüòÉ

[removed]

Because it‚Äôs casual
---
Running on the latest drivers, and I'm reinstalling the entire game right now so I can't check the actual temps, but one thing I do know is that the CPU usage is sky high. It maxes out no matter what I do.
---

---
I heard of the 100% cpu bug before, but it seems like the fix was to limit your FPS, but how can I limit my FPS to 144 when it doesn't even reach it like it should?
---
What is your CPU usage when you play?
---
Thanks a ton for helping me out as well!
---
Why did you delete?
---
That‚Äôs what really kills her gun. You run the recoil up a wall and it can basically run at a 45 degree angle diagonally either way.
---
lol
---
Op good luck taking that on a plane
---
Plat 2 (PC), but your friend is right. If you sort by new, you will see.
---
Both
---
They have newcomer mode I guess lv50 is enough to get the hang of the game
---
Yeah I'm pretty sure the only words that will be detected would be swear and racial words.
---
Excactly. The only downsides to those strats would be attackers sticking together and working together,but that's mostly the biggest issue when playing Cav as Cav was designed to hunt down lone wolves who don't pay much attention to their surroundings.
---
I haven't played with or against many Monty's at my level. Is this normal?? lol
---
The buff she deserves to be actually useful.
---
Risk and speed.
---
I'd rather loose a row than place them too low to blow the Mira.
---
Well you can get extra thwick if you really try.
---
You don't even wanna know how many times I've been 1 tapped through my shield as bb
---
It normal for maybe an impact or a nitro cell to get thrown but not to this extent, lol.
---
Yep. But also prolly the scariest attacker aswell
---
\*\*Neighborino
---
I mean you were reloading and when you do that you move the gun?
---
How do u get the pixel stats? Btw thanks for your research!
---
lmao good one!
---
I would have been waiting in garage to clap those cheeks
---
HOW ARE YOU SO FUNNY AND ORIGINAL????
---
Alex is a defender and has an observer that she can place and if someone walks over it notifies the team about their position. Nokk‚Äôs hel and thatchers emp disable it. She is armed with a bow with knock back and a trident with loyalty.
---
Played since launch on PS4 and switched to pc a couple of months ago. Definitely worth it
---
You‚Äôll deal with a little bit less toxicity but way better controls and FPS 
---
Just start off buying the operators you use most
---
so someone doesnt fall from the sky raining bullets at the worst possible time
---
9 days passed and still at Ash, how many days till it change the operator?
---
Often I did, especially when I‚Äôm lying near one
---
I droned it out first so I would‚Äôve been ready for you ;)
---
So the Emerald in operation Emerald stands for Emerald splash, right?
---
nice, what's ur sens?
---
Would it though?
---
Also, at least on PC, I'm running 120+fps with a three year old graphics card at this point, so I doubt the frame loss would be that crippling for anyone on a 60hz monitor
---
Stole your joke buddy
---
Great thank you so much

... exactly. Ubi only gives them one reinforcement so that people don‚Äôt purposely play recruit (I.e to keep recruit out of the meta)
---
was playing with a three stack and a random, clutched the first round and then we lost the second after one from the three stack threw. The random votes kicked and i was like ‚Äòokay‚Äô and accepted and then they all came into VC *not the random* and cussing me out eventually TKing me the entire match.

Diamond but this season was the hardest for diamond, too many mnk and ddosers or console these days. It gets worse and worse.

It's ok buddy. I'm sure your dad loves you, just in his own special way

Look at the ting lmg legendary or the mp5 legendary they're ugly af
---
If only we could change the reticles color.  I want a green holo is that so much to ask?
---
People like to break hatches from below because sometimes it will cause people to fall down. I usually reinforce the one behind bunk beds on Hereford if I'm playing Echo.
---
Operation Water in Nether:

New operators: Steve and alex

New map: Overworld

They also cant treat girls right either
---
I'm still waiting for cap elite
---
I don't think it will make it easier or better for us poor people. They don't care about that, this is a grab for more money.
---
I think he should be able to see through smoke much quicker. His pick rate is to low
---
Cool!
---
Ask him to lock his framerate to 144 or 120, His cpu is most likely bottle necking his gpu.
---
Yea that would be nice.  In games like overwatch where characters have red outlines green really pops. It doesn‚Äôt bother me as much in this game tho.
---
Literally full lol.
---
To me, recruit rushing has lost its glamour so I‚Äôll almost never join in, and I‚Äôm almost always Tk‚Äôd

Lol make him an attack operator smash through any wall

Fortunately I play with friends, but only one of them wouldn‚Äôt TK me for not playing recruit, because to the other two, it‚Äôs a meme and all who don‚Äôt play recruit get TK‚Äôd

Idk maybe you guys are playing with shitty players or just have a bad strategy.

---
This is why OHS from any weapon is controversial rule of Siege. You can like it, but you cannot die that this is the best thing in the shooter games.
---
I‚Äôm running angled grip with compensator because angled grip is generally more comfort to me. Both grips have decent verticals recoil on a compensator, but i prefer angled grip because it kicks to the right for 2/3 of mag, instead of verticals grip which changes the  direction of horizontal recoil every 2 seconds.( Ubisoft this gun is a joke right?)
---
What is that attached to?
---
enslaved ela
---
I disagree. This gives me a reason to play besides the fact I already enjoy the game. This gives them a means to earn more revenue from a game that has minimal profit besides purchasing base content and skins. It also gives them a means to add new content with a means of character development. I love the fact that I can support the game, earn something while doing it, and gain relatively exclusive content that only other supporters and players with the same amount of time per season as me could obtain. Monetization is what keeps games relevant. You look at Fortnite, and no matter if you like the game or not, it's huge, and it's Battle Pass allows for tons of monetization and playtime. Don't like it, don't buy it.

I like to watch pro league to find interesting angles and gadget placement to make myself better. I obviously don‚Äôt try out full pro league strats but I take little bits and pieces and apply it to my game.
---
For example: I wanted to get better with Valk cause good black eye placement can really help out your team, so I watched some pro league games and learned some new cheeky spots. It‚Äôs not game changing but simple things like that will benefit you and your team.

---
Grzmots only last 5 seconds one.  Ela is a three speed but she's the worst defender as her scorpion is the only primary without a recoil dismond making it the worst primary, a very niche pistol that does the lowest damage of all handguns and only a 12 meter fall off range. 2 secondary gadgets that are completely useless as she's a very agressive roamer but is given two stationary gadgets. 
---
Her shotgun only beats all shotguns with its fire rate. The damage is worse than every shotgun that isn't a secondary. At both cqc snd long range. Even worse than the m870 at range. It only beats most shotguns at mid range around 18 meters. Past that the damage per pellet is negligible.  It doesn't have a high dps either as the french semi auto and sagia are only a few hit points off or even higher than the gun. It's not even close to being overpowered.
---
Ikr, the other team went for a smoke plant the round before so I thought maybe I would try him
---
That's why I quit maining Lesion after the chaos break out.
---
Make creeper an attacker so he's a self destruct hard breacher but a hole bigger than thermite, and Steve defends by putting up to 6 blocks of obsidian.

I honestly thought that I would miss the knife hit like I missed the 2nd shotgun shot
---
Hiya, semi-new Rainbow player myself. I‚Äôll address your questions: 
---
-yes, this game is extremely difficult. It has an incredibly severe learning curve. I got smacked endlessly when I first picked up the game, and it was frustrating. It was hard to transition to R6‚Äôs playstyle coming from games like CoD or Battlefield. I will admit: I had buyer‚Äôs regret at first. I had to stop playing because I would get too anxious and hearing people yell at me over mic‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt fun. That‚Äôs the bad side. To counter it, I‚Äôll offer this: this game is amazing. Once you get the feel for the gameplay, you would be hard pressed to find another game as satisfying to be good at. Easily one of my best purchases and I am so glad that I stuck with it. 
---
-Operators can take time to learn. There are operators that are easy to learn, and those that are hard to learn. Even that isn‚Äôt cut and dry either though. A truly skilled player can take even ‚Äúbad‚Äù or ‚Äúlow success‚Äù operators and do well with them. I‚Äôm a Kapkan main. Kapkan is one of the simplest operators to learn, and very easy to counter. Yet, even at high levels of play I always catch 2 or 3 people with tripmines because I‚Äôve invested time into getting good with him. I know where to place his traps to catch people off guard. That just takes practice, like anything in gaming. It‚Äôll be fine if you get the game, because unlocking new operators can take a while, and so you‚Äôll get plenty of practice with those you do have. Guns are a minimal issue honestly, very few guns are hard to control, and the ones that are you‚Äôll adjust to. 
---
-micro transactions are non issues, really. *Nearly* everything you could want in the game can be bought with in game currency, and the stuff that can‚Äôt is purely cosmetic. 
---
I think you should buy the game, but before you do, think about these things: Am I likely to quit if the game seems hard? Can I handle losing and being on the bottom of the leaderboard for a while until I gain map and strat knowledge? Am I likely to play this with friends? These are the important questions, and your answers can have a big impact. Most importantly though, don‚Äôt buy this game if you‚Äôre going to quit easily. It‚Äôs a tough start, and I don‚Äôt want to see you waste money. I love the game, but it isn‚Äôt for the easily frustrated. Heck, I rage quit from time to time when I have a bad day. 
---
Best of luck, see you around

Thanks, over all I think the community is pretty great, there are some jerks. When I started a year and a half ago I used to get team killed all the tome for being a new player. That has at least in my experience changed a lot since getting several of my friends into the game. I rarely see anyone grief like that on console.

&gt;Also if youre older, like youre acting to be, then its also a little surprising to be fine with such a system when older games didnt demand you pay for skins and such,
---
I'm in my 30s and grew up when unlockables were pretty common and honestly, I prefer the system nowadays. Because of the often absurd requirements to unlock stuff I either would just never get them or would acquire them and then have nothing left to do in the game. Now I can just pay an often insignificant amount and use the cosmetics right away.

I was thinking about dokkaebi cause she can have the opposite team phones go off

I can‚Äôt play T-Hunt alone purely because of this

Nice job op! Always a good feeling to stick it to those vote kicking you.

I‚Äôm usually leading in kills and points. Latest instance was a team of three people that were killing my friend and I and they sent us party invites to scream in our ears and laugh at us.

Yeah but let it be an easter egg with a low chance of occuring. Like 1/100 or something

Agreed. Altough the extreme metaphoric symbology of EoE makes it a complete mindfuck, it has spawned some deep debates.
---
Fun fact is, most people that I've seen who watched the anime and EoE had the very same reaction. The first 24h after finishing it is the anger/denial phase: you curse at that nearly incomprehensible shit and treat it as the worst nonsense thing ever. The second day is the sadness: it's like a mix of missing it and being depressed and unmotivated. Then the third and last day comes: the reflection/insight on how Evagelion's symbolism applies to your life and theorization of its mean (also coupled with the search for theories online).
---
Lmao. Grats, you're not using the services you're bitching about. So what exactly is your point?
---
If you're not buying any of it why are you so triggered? You can buy ops with renown. Renown boosters just help you gain a free currency quicker, its pay to be lazy.
---
And guess what? You don't have to buy the event packs, as you already said you aren't. So again, why are you so triggered over things you're not actually buying?
---
Then it's because you're low lvl
---
Siege community is just toxic as hell, tks eill get reverse friendly fire, and if they try to insult you, this will be filtered / they'll get banned

Also it should be 'sight'. But I'd leave it because it made me laugh.

Honestly, it‚Äôs gonna happen if you use it on every gun. Put it in 1-2 operators you play often but not main. It‚Äôll feel new a lot longer. I think the biggest mistake I made was using it on literally everyone so it got old fast.

Probaly glocks and Soviet hand grenades

Because we are letting developers stomp onto consumers with all the monetization tactics. People need to see that Ubisoft doesn't need the cash from the upcoming battle pass. 
---
Not triggered, but really dislike developers like these. I want to make people more aware and vocal about these issues in the industry.
---
If no one said anything about Stawars Battlefront II imagine where we would be at now? By your logic I can't criticize something I don't support.

I'm so ritch I went to Harvard to study english

Who the fuck would ruin an evo like that, even if it is an airsoft gun, just why, I get you want to replicate something from a game but of all choices, THAT. Fuck that. Rant over

But you gotta admit it still kind of helps especially for the deagle.

What the fuck have you brought upon this cursed land?

I will take your word for it. Honestly the number of skins I have is piling up to the point I don't know which ones I should replace with the diamond.
---
I wasn't ritch enough
---
It‚Äôs on the TTS servers on PC where people beta test the new ops and the devs adjust them as needed from the gameplay and reportedbugs
---
Yea and lets be real, we are looking at a picture (taken with a camera). Vigil might be there
---
this zofia didn‚Äôt get a kill all match, was 0-6. Saw her coming up stairs on coastline from a cam prefired the angle and she insta one tapped me. I was her only kill if the match and it tilted me off the face of the earth

Oof, Feelsbadman

No, there isn't an M9.

Would have expected it as a secondary pistol for Blackbeard and Valk...

Now thats original

One of the best comments so far lmao

I geuss I'm buying it then

I don't know but your imagination is really good. Makes me think too. Damn.

It's nice because the support the longevity of siege as a whole.

I'm glad America would *never* do that to anyone.

Well I have 2 of those(thatcher and sledge) but also Fuze, kapkan and Mute(and the elite everyone has of Ash)...

lol theyre assuming they can tk u again probably lol im trying this

Sad but true

That‚Äôs happened to me a couple of times.

i just checked now, and i was deducted 28 points lmfao. I was expecting to gain for losing last night with an enemy hacker feelsbadman

Which hunts only make things worse then they need to be. It‚Äôs only an opinion on my part regarding the flair. I won‚Äôt get into it but I personally think Hereford isn‚Äôt bad, it‚Äôs not perfect, but it‚Äôs miles better then the original in terms of balance and is better balanced then maps like Chalet and Skyscraper that are somehow still in ranked. That‚Äôll be it from me.

Honestly, it might just be

Yeah I understand they are probably messing around, warming up, or trying new things.

Just strange im being paired with top tier ranks with less than a week on the game. I enjoyed the goofy nature of casual on those first few days and made a good handful of friends. I was only going to try ranked after I really learned the maps.

I don't mean to be *that* guy, but isn't this technically witch-hunting? Cause the name giveaway and stuff? I agree completely, he's a chose, but I don't want innocent intent posts getting delete for no good reason.

*MY GREATEST ENEMY IN RANKED*
---
The time is shown at the top, and I used Finka cause with buck you have to go back and reload more often, I never use sledge cause his hammer can't be refilled like with Finka's shotgun or with Buck's Skeleton Key
---
Lmao
---
What about the quality? Will i get 1080p 60fps?
---
Pretty bored
---
I feel like in the meme of spiederman where he indicate himself.
---
Lol no problem
---
I don't know, quality mostly depends on what you specs can handle.
---
This never ends well
---
Because you can't reason with shills jerking off to anything pro league related. 
---
Everyone could play either bomb or other two modes if they wanted to. It's so fucking dumb to say that one rank doesn't represent your skill for all modes. In this fucking game you get point for winning. If you shoot well and know what the fuck is an FPS game, you will perform well in any mode regardless so that argument is completely irrelevant and stupid. 
---
Kids just want to feel they are pro players by doing same shit they do. I fucking bet if Ubi makes pro league play only one map these morons will start telling everyone how competitive and balanced one-map-ranked is.
---
yeah that specific drop wouldnt be as op now tho with the new hatch mechanics they put in for maverick. 1 pellet isnt enough to break it anymore so your whole team would lose like 40 hp in the process :P

It kinda sucks though, audio gets messed up a lot, it captures audio from programs other than your game so most of my replays contain at least one discord notification sound, And the fps tends to be uneven.

You missed your opportunity to call it "Operation Diamond  Shaft"
---
The most impressive thing about that was the fact you used √∏ in chat
---
I made a lot of suggestions and guesstimate callouts too because I want more control when I‚Äôm dead. There are times when this can somewhat be helpful, but I‚Äôve heard shit that‚Äôs completely useless like DEFUSING DEFUSING or PLANTING PLANTING that throws people into panic for no reason and gets them killed. My advice is just calm the fuck down when you‚Äôre dead and let the player do their thing. If they suck, too bad. But at least YOU didn‚Äôt contribute to them choking. Suggestions and callouts are fine and mostly welcome, but there‚Äôs a line between simple stuff and being disruptive and a control freak.
---
well. you ruined his fun by playing cav. so i guess he ruined your fun by alt+f4.

Or you know, you could be Scandinavian and just press the "√∂" button

Frosts primary SMG has no recoil at all, as long as you can aim for the chest/head it‚Äôll be a killing machine for you as it‚Äôs easy to control.

But you have retards

Ah, ok. Just thought the thumbnail was quite similar to his

Day boi is scary lol

Honestly I don‚Äôt think it is possible to completely remove MnK from console. People will always find a way around it and will pay money if that‚Äôs what they have to do.

Mira. Easy to learn, and after 2 years she‚Äôs still one of the best defenders, and a big part of the meta. When you start learning the maps and begin to roam, I would go for vigil, great weapons, easy, and really useful gadget.

I see people starting every day so you aren't the only one. The advice I always give for attacking is, make sure you use your drone, you can use it to see whether anybody is in an area you're going to and the game gives it to you for a reason. I would also recommend going into a terrorist hunt and setting your gun to single fire, this promotes getting headshots and aiming at head level. VarsityGaming has a series on youtube called "Siege School" which provides tips that are beneficial towards newer players. His playlist can be found [here.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsSNbAgLD2wzW3I_wJevUm2bgrCmhjgGI) Also if people teamkill you, just know that it's not your fault, the community has been toxic and teamkilling is prevalent in newcomer and casual. If you have any questions ask me and I'll do my best to answer them :)
---
Personally i dont care if they leave it there. Its just another way for players who arent as good to try to keep up. Downvote me if you want idc.

Aight thx

Good to be bold, not to be greedy.

Maestro or Echo.
---
I play the fuck out of Mira so.... YEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
I just did the Kanal rework
---
I don't know much about this so I might be wrong but will f they are only doing it in custom he's surely bugs wouldn't matter that much and you can already break the soft floors so they be adding that much anyway.
---
U can do that?
---
There is no such thing as being late to start playing a game.
---
This is why allowing MnK is a viable option
---
Yup, check your dm. If anyone else wants it check the twitter account i mentionned.
---
But is it cyka?
---
*moments before disaster*
---
i think they did if i'm not wrong
---
Anchor = Echo/Maestro
---
Utility = Lesion/Valkyrie/Mozzie/Mira
---
Roamer = Vigil/Ela/Caveira
---
The name on the front are the one that i highly recommend picking up.
---
Echo has 2 drones that can burst a sonic wave to interupt bomb plant or give the enermy a dizzy effect. And not to mention 2 free cams as well. And it can stick to the ceiling and be invisible.
---
Lesion can place 7 gu mine in each round (Regen 1 Mine every 30 secs).
---
Vigil can be invisible to drones and play the enermy cause they wont know where you're. When you go invisible the drone will have a special white line covering it. As long you're within the radius it will show up. But they wont know WHERE.
---
In case someone is confused as fuck I think this was a H O N G Y K O N G Y meme and because The people's republic of China has a say in every second thing Reddit and Google are bending over for them so memes about them are not allowed because memes are the best way to send a message
---
Git gud scrub

I would love that feature
---
I see what you mean but it's still an advantage, still cheating and still unfair for those who can't afford it or just don't cheat
---
How do you guys have that main thing infront of your name?
---
Agreed. I personally don‚Äôt have a problem with it but I‚Äôm sick of people constantly complaining about people using MnK on console.
---
Make the likes 11111
---
If you like playing Tachunky (you probably wont but bear with me), buy Maestro. He has a laser beam machine gun with an ACOG, a really strong revolver with no recoil and he also about to have impact nade. The evil eyes is like a jack of all trade tools and with the shotgun secondary or the impact you can open up new line of sight for you or the evil eyes
---
You can't deny that it's definitely harder if you're late. No map knowledge, no clue about gadgets and so on. You can catch up if you put in the time but the beginning is for sure gonna be frustrating. I've been thru that with Dead by Daylight a while ago lol
---
And a fuck ton of DDossers
---
Thank you for the tip, I‚Äôll have to try that because its just ridiculous
---
Yea, I wish it was cleaner
---
it's a simple spell but quite unbreakable
---
Can't think of anyone who plays Siege but I assume there are people on here who would be willing to help out a bit
---
sure this could work but its more likely that you would be killed by an recoil headshot since people dont know how to pull down on their mouse.
---
Thanks for linking me to that series! I'll make sure to watch it
---
Alt F4 gives you a random one! It‚Äôs like a slot machine, try it sometime.
---
With the map pools growing and maps constantly changing I think its a solid idea. In comp the replays are turned off anyways. This is a solid idea that should be implemented.

Hello SirMSJames, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cv7x8p/wtf_is_that_shot_on_ps4/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
r/R6STeams
---
Yeah, I usually call him Tachunky. On many map with basement site, he‚Äôs very useful in defending the hatch from thermite, hibana, and maverick. On bomb sites you can use him to defend plant.
---
If you start shooting laser at the attacker the moment he goes for the plant. You can down him by the time he finish planting the defuser.
---
Well there ya go. Cheers!

U flashed her but all people know that, when u get flashed by blitz spam melee

Exactly. It's not like they can prevent these companies from making adaptors
---
Me and the boys telling the scary story of ‚ÄúThe Lost Acogs‚Äù
---
But who is it the person aimed perfectly and do replays even show enemies being flashed or hurt?
---
She was flashed. If you are too close to the enemy they will eventually do it like this. Try to blind them from a distance where they cant knife your shield away and wait like two seconds. Then kill them with your pistol after they "panic-fired" at you.
---
One of the developers I believe said that instead of focusing on new guns, they want to focus on new attachments for existing weapons. That says to me suppressors on shotguns
---
More attractive than cav.
---
ty
---
No
---
She didnt aim perfectly, do you see her aim move across the screen after you flashed her? And no it doesnt show enemies being flashed sadly.
---
Ok I was under the assumption that the replay shows the enemy being blind but I guess it doesn‚Äôt. Same goes for the enemy being hurt too, it doesn‚Äôt show, right?
---
That is the question...
---
I love this style of animation, you did an amazing job. Did you get the idea from therussianbadger?
---
Same goes for being shot, right? Doesn‚Äôt show the enemies being hurt. I had 3 health anyways so I knew my time would come
---
Looked like Monty had the defuser in the corner tucked behind him, guessing they couldn't reach it or were just incompetent
---
Or you could pay attention. At all times the hud is telling you what room you're in
---
MnK can only walk in 4 directions, theoretically the game can pick up on that and put MnK against other MnK‚Äôs.

I meant using mnk doesnt get you that good stats. It's clearly ddsossing or bossting
---
Thought the same until I saw it was done on console. Forget shooters on console for me, I'd be aiming at either the floor or the sky

Instead of your gun moving, you get shot backwards.  Perfect.

I play for an org playing R6. Does that make me a pro player? No.

Thank you Kanye very cool

Teach me. Teach us hard stuck copper 4. Lmao

Well yeah.. but the game is balanced around the multiplayer mode, it's no surprise they don't balance T hunt

Bro ure straining ur brain too much on an adjective. Chill out. It is wat it is. Just an adjective to describe an environment where ppl compete seriously.
---
Sweet, thanks!
---
Thats not bad
---
Haha very funny
---
It's easier to change friends.
---
the reason that happens is that in a t-hunt, there are at least 12 more characters with movement files being loaded by your computer. in a cas, there is 10. you may not be able to see the terrorist moving around the map at all times, but they are and your computer is loading it.
---
It's not straining. It's a basic truth you refuse to come to terms with üòÇ
---
I agree
---
It's sad that this got rewarded. Shows how immature and pathetic most of these communities are...

Really amazing, im a ying/frost main and i love this!

Damn girl you blind me without even using candellas

Nah Mira just stole it

Dev account on a Developer build of the game. No way this is getting into the live build of the game when the new season releases.
---
Agreed easily op imo.

Smonky does a stinky

Sure bro. Watever makes u sleep at night. I guess 1+1=11 now. Cuz it shudnt be as simple as 1+1=2, right?
---
Can u tell me your attachment?
---
perhaps in newcomers playlist, but everywhere else maybe not. i do agree there should be more crutches for newer player, but this game thrives from being more challenging, and part of that is map knowledge.

Since Goyo is getting one and is a 2 speed, I think they would be okay with giving valk one. They mentioned giving some 2 speeds acogs, valk is the obvious choice because she is tied to warden and he *needs* the acog.
---
Sounds like you should play Buck
---
Who shit in your cereal this morning?

Just like his father

you put more effort into your video then Russian badger because he has a slideshow and you have a full animation

I do it on console!! It requires some friends to message everyone you can on the other team that you can, and if there are people who don‚Äôt want to you just count on them to tk or to vote to kick, same for your team. It‚Äôs worked a few times for me
---
So now your stuck in there half a heart left but don't die die die die die die die die
---
As I've said, with her current gadget, she's barely better than 2 Speed and only in terms of flanking and re positioning. However, 3 Speed can achieve as much while still being better than Nokk in every other aspect such as firepower and utility aspect. 
---
Even if Nokk receive a much stronger gun, 3 Speeds Attackers will be more efficient due to them still having a similar if not better flanking capability while also having utility. Someone mentioned on another thread that even if Nokk receive R4C he won't use her when Ash is still capable of rotating around faster and have soft breaching capability. Nokk simply do not offer anything more than what IQ could offer if her stealth aspect stays the same. 
---
However, if she becomes 3 Speed, it will make her more unique and offers being the fastest/quietest Attacker by allowing her to run quickly (and quieter too due to being 3 Speed) from point to point before using her gadget to be quiet. 
---
It might be enough to justify her lack of utility and a weak gun if Nokk can flank faster and quieter overall. 
---
That aside, I'd still be very grateful if Ubi DOES give a better gun instead because while it might not make her that much more viable due to still not offering much by herself, it will be so much better than just leaving her alone in her current state which is my biggest fear regarding Nokk. 
---
On the other hand, simply giving the 3rd choice might not work because Ubi will probably try to give a gun that's on the similar level as FMG and Six12. The only similar level but offering a different benefit would be MP5SD as it's basically FMG with an ACOG. While that would be an improvement by giving Nokk a more range benefit, it would not be enough to make her feel that much better.
---
Yes I understand that and I was sarcastic. Of course they never gonna do that. It was just funny to see
---
I've got a new wallpaper
---
Until you get one it's good. After that, I'm not so sure
---
I mean is it really that hard to spot a pattern from the same account(s) that their entire server/lobby crashes constantly ? Yeah Xbox could def step up but Ubisoft needs to do something other than ‚Äúwell both teams don‚Äôt lose SR now if people get DDOSed.‚Äù Its a step in right direction but that fact the games such a joke and I don‚Äôt want my internet being screwed with is insane

---
They should really brush up on the reloading for any revolver in the game. You empty out all of the chambers and but fresh ammo in and flick the cylinder back into place, but just because you canceled the animation despite after putting in fresh rounds, the ammo is considered unusable. Apparently grabbing the grip with your off hand is essential for reloading.
---
IQ is perfectly fine as is. she has a very strong gadget with a coordinated team and very good guns. Pengu is the last person i would listen to for balancing advice. his track record for saying dumb things speaks for itself
---
Beta except it never worked so I guess launch.
---
So many things were wrong here, First don't sprint in with fuze your ass can be heard from 300km away haha
---
I have played the beta, too. Bought it on December 23rd 2015.
---
Lmao seeing more G36 in ranked and proleague than R4 nowadays.
---
congratulations on being toxic to someone simply for not having an elite skin. very cool
---
That would be interesting, but an ACOG on Nokk would be op.
---
Definitely better than yoga pants and white jacket Ela cosplays, this probably took a lot of effort. Mad props.
---
And I was making a semi self-reflective joke, as I myself am a teenage boy.

I still ask to myself why not quit some of the attachments to particular operators for and easy fix

Frenchie here.
---
If they keep saying "Plus tard merde", Most likely they're not saying that.
---
They're probably saying  "Putain ta m√©re" which can't be directly translated but it's something along the lines of "Your mom is a whore" or "FUCK YOUR MOM". (again not accurate at all)
---
Nothing you can do on console unfortunately. Just have to take the loss and move on. What they did was essentially DDOS the siege server while you guys were attacking so you didn‚Äôt even have a chance to do anything. Then after they plant they do the same. Lag the server.
---
Can we switch our flash light on to show respect

Just grapple to the floor *boomp* you played yourself

Oh no we still won somehow, and why tf does siege have this sort of shit happen in the game

Its a very nice cosplay! And its also funny how you cosplay a Hong gonk police forces

Looks like someone needs a really big hole

Okay this is epic

Border patrol, drone hunt, hide and seek, garage wars

A guy named "HI :|" on youtube did that with some other maps. he's very smol tho so it's better if you look for "100% map destruction"
---
I'd LOVE a commentator pack
---
Low RoF gun. Sure you reticle over her head a few times, but your aim is already way off by the time you fire your shots.
---
too many
---
you have to make up callouts like other games
---
My brain hurts from watching that, also there are siege drones irl
---
Weird flex but ok
---
 no one cares stop jerking yourself off
---
Jammers don't work on needles, or bullets
---
Don't let this fool you. Not every console players aim looks like this.
---
Ubi said that when they tested potential weapons for her, they found that ARs (and ACOGs in general) were too powerful.
---
That‚Äôs always satisfying to hear that. Even with cheating, they still suck lol. I think it‚Äôs the way it all communicates. It‚Äôs easy to pull all the IP in the current game since there‚Äôs a host and they just hit the siege server. It‚Äôs rampant once you get into Platinum. It‚Äôs almost every game once I hit plat 2
---
I have just as much roght to try as hard as i want in casual or dont try in casual. I bought the game ill do what i please within the rules.
---
Delete this plz
---
They could do that, but then people would be complaining that she doesn't have ACOG when Echo, with the same gun, does.
---
Change your fire alarm batteries
---
if the maps are boring the callouts are pretty much non existent
---
Tbh I have no idea, I'm from Quebec and never heard anything similar to this as an insult aha.
---
They did have a glaz, he died in the beginning of the round tho, this just shows how situational his ability can be
---
No, it came out in season 2, alongside n√∏kk and warden. Go to seasonal skins, its right there.
---
That's not true at all, lots of people pick rook for the armor, especially those thay aren't good in gunfights so they have have some kind of team contribution. But doc in some rook armor.and he stands a much better chance of getting that self revive, the two together are deadly and not because of the guns. Having an extra 225 HP and a certain DBNO state can make all the difference to a team.
---
Lol happens to us all.
---
By skill do you mean incredible recoil control? Also yeah their gadgets are pretty much useless for the most part
---

Operation diamond mine

Good but why isn‚Äôt that more common then? Because the ACOG is used exclusively at higher levels as it‚Äôs so good. The holo players are at a disadvantage even if they do well. 
---
Id rather see Doc get 4-5 heals and lose the ACOG, than keep him the same. Should always be Utility over weaponry

It says round 2, but none of the teams have point.

The game is broken, and has been broken for fucking ages. But complaining is going to do fucking nout isn't it. Esports shouldn't define whether a game is good or not, genuinely I couldn't give two flying fucks about Esports, for me its fucking pointless
---
\*Please report Morzol, he is hacking ofc
---
Yes. Noticeable recoil that you have to master. 
---
And yes, if ACOG was removed, they‚Äôd be a lot weaker
---
nice
---
Don't be the guy that hasn't got an SSD
---
Armors are another aspect of the game they portrayed unrealistically for gameplay purposes. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I mean yeah, how can Warden and Kaid have such high resistance? Many things barely make any sense in R6S but it's ok: the game is highly immersive but it's not supposed to be too realistic.
---
You have 4 trappers and u can only be in a team of 5. Even with the 3 ops I listed that‚Äôs more than enough utility to deny a rush. I would also want more tactical options but for the meantime give the rest of the community something fun that they would enjoy.
---
Fair point. I think the acog isn't a major game changer her played right, but combining her with spawnpeeking would make her too powerful. The solutions would be to punish running out more or switch either her gun or warden's. The more viable option of the two is to give warden the MP5SD. This does give me an idea for a new attacking op, though. Something along the lines of deploying like 3 devices on windows with a drone. When they are activated, they would make a smokescreen over the window so the attackers can't see into spawn (it would recharge over the match, meaning like she would get more, maybe 7). Sorry to go off on a tangent, I just thought it might fit on the topic of running out. That would mean warden could keep the MPX with an acog if spawn peeking was less of an issue.
---
I play on a trashy notebook that costs about the same as a gaming console ever since I had move out for college, and while it's definitely not ideal it's better than nothing. Still, my solution would be adding all-chat to console as an option instead.
---
how did you trap the terrorists?
---
Goodie
---
a grappling hook and a canister that exlodes when you shoot it is complex?
---
Then with your argument since I use thermite for his good gun and acog we should remove his acog. Doc and rook would still be great ops without an acog, if you are complaining about spawnpeaking a red dot or a reflex can also spawn peak.
---
it‚Äôs sick :)

By the rest of the community, you mean you.

Because Microsoft and Sony are really controlling with their console's system and their people are the only ones allowed to use the infrastructure needed for banning console accounts.  On PC it is simple ban for UPLAY account. On consoles only Micro and Sony are allowed to ban THEIR accounts as they belong to them, not Ubi.

But do you pick Thermite predominantly for the weapon over the super important utility? Nope.

Sure the weapon helps but the gadget is what thermite is known for

I would agree with you if the weapons were like that with SD variants or renamed weapons with different stats on magazines but it‚Äôs not like that at all. 
---
Warden has the MP5, exact same as Valkyrie in every stat and attachment possible. I could say the same to the other 7 recycled weapons. 
---
So no, it‚Äôs not a lie.

I am factually correct about recycled weapons at the moment and I claim it will continue for the worse.

Visual looks mean nothing. If it‚Äôs the same stats it‚Äôs the same weapon, end of story.

Server sees you shoot but you are already registered as dead so the shoot doesn‚Äôt count

No this would hold people's hands. The hard learning curve has always been a great thing about the game and that includes map knowledge. This game is all about situational awareness. Not handing you everything

According to [this,](https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/status/) they should be up. It's a known issue to be stuck on the loading screen. I've seen others fix it by restarting their console, or by simply waiting a little bit.

Well for a start, pro league already had pick and ban so they didn't need it added. Secondly, ALOT of the community across all platforms wanted it in ranked, so that's not a top 1%. They don't just value PC players, that's just ridiculous.
---
there is no black ice for the mpx.
---
Could work as an alternative!
---
Yeah I understand where you're coming from, but we only put plane and house on there because I think house is too small, and plane has a spawm peeking problem
---
I play vertical and horizontal 100 but ADS 25
---
me too one of the reasons I cosplay her &lt;3
---
Go to subreddit, 3 dots up in right, change flair
---
I remember when this wasn't how it worked. 
---
Many a death as blitz from that shit.  Then again he was also a 3 armor at the time so...
---
Dude, those maps aren't even in ranked, so why care about something that isn't even a real issue? ü§î
---
I thought it was too small, so we put it in!
---
Wouldn't he have a lower pick rate than all of them because of how frequently he's banned?
---
When was this? Before or after they added the HWID bans? I just want to play again. I regret everything...
---
This is more of a nerf for the shield as well because I hear many people saying it‚Äôs overpowered and I feel like this would be a good buff for glaz and a good nerf for the shield.
---
just some random sneakers from amazon and I only changed out the laces
---
Dad main here go on the front page of r/rainbow6 and look in the top right corner PM me if you need more help
---
Well if the Operator from India coming next season is an attacker that is a possibility since India did recently purchase AK-203 Rifles which are essentially export models of the AK-12 (be it they‚Äôre export versions of the production model AK-12 which is different from the prototype model Fuze uses but it doesn‚Äôt matter)
---
practice aiming at head level. this will come with time and can only be achieved by playing more and more. also, the buckles on the head level part of doorway barricades are a representation of where the head level is for enemies if they're right up against it. a good way to improve micro flicks is to flick onto objects within the map to help with muscle memory.
---
Because my friend, nor I play ranked often, I think it's good if we give the casual community a bit of love too
---
Enjoy your game without texture because "tHiS Is cOsMEtiC OnLy" then.
---
thank you sm!!!
---
They fell right into your trap.
---
Seamus Cowden aka "Sledge" would be a great Cosplay to start. Seamus is tall (1,92cm) and his SAS suit is easier to make than most. Hope you have fun.
---
I will preach this and give warden P90 till i die. FUCK the mpx, but most of all, FUCK the fmg9!
---
Initial purchase cost, and flavour of extra DRM. All launch uPlay, which then launches the game.
---
Dota 2 is F2P and gives you every hero from the start.
---
Muh game dev is expensive.
---
So, since Ying killed cav first, ying's team won. IF they had an actual draw (like EXACT same time of kill), the draw goes to the defenders, UNLESS the defuser is planted.

thank you, fellow shield boy &lt;3
---
made a pattern out of paper of the overall shape and created the base with 3 layers of black thick fabric. used eva foam to make all the armor parts glued the on and made the pouches with eva foam and fabris as well I would do a tutorial if enough ppl are interested!
---
That's literally the reason why this is so fucking greedy.
---
The reason this is not the case is, that this could drag out a match far too long. If this weren't a concern, matches would be laid out like PL matches.
---
Dont worry, it happens on Xbox as well
---
This is how my Chanka looks
---
I agree. They‚Äôd be a fragging op for sure
---
How hypocritical considering you spelled Nokk wrong
---
ooo true
---
F's in the chat boys
---
Barlett U. Should be reworked first

Speaking of sources- if anyone is curious here's the article I'm citing.

i'm watching you wazowski. always watching. always
---
Nokk's actually not terrible
---
Honestly is this the kind of entitlement shit that kids think these days !
---
Half asian lawyer Bill Richmond? I'm sorry......
---
How do you use the "Best Ops"?
---
I agree. If the battle pass doesn't change what we already have and only adds new things, then I'm fine with it. But if they gimp the stuff we get now in order to get us to pay for it, I'll be pissed.
---
I‚Äôm just happy I‚Äôll have a way to get loot instead of rolling Maui duplicates over and over
---
It‚Äôs cause I barely have any ops and we‚Äôre hoping this was possible. I‚Äôm not annoyed or mad this isn‚Äôt happening I was just curious
---
Dude I've been playing this game since beta and level 330 and I got BI for just 6 ops.
---
Eh, she‚Äôs only good at super low or super high levels of play, she either takes no team play or a crap ton.
---
I understand you‚Äôre upset with me but bro, shitting on people‚Äôs property is a hell of a lot different than cheating in a game...
---
No, the Smg-11
---
Deleted what?
---
I'm surprised you're so angry about this, it's just a company operating in their own interest to make money. You're literally getting mad about a company being too successful!
---
You clearly aren't a fan of purchasing these cosmetics, so don't! The rest of the community will vote with their wallets also. No harm done. 
---
As long as the cosmetics don't affect gamplay, I. E. Para bellum, I don't give a shit.
---
He was probably doing it for jokes. (Maybe not)
---
Thats the grind of the game ! Just have to keep playing and choosing your ops wisely.
---
My heart goes out to you my friend, that‚Äôs rough.
---
Stolen
---
Prove it
---
Just use the live chat and they can lift the suspension
---
Exactly why I think it will be viable, it will be somewhat of a challenge to shoot through those windows and in that time the defender behind the shield may have time to peek.
---
Similar to a game of casual i had the other day, a grenade bounced off my Clash shield and killed the hostage, poor  bloke
---
Ok I was making shitty joke
---
I immediately tk everyone who tears down my castle barricades and I don‚Äôt feel bad
---
"Blue ^on ^^blue ^^**BLAT"**
---
It's like a Ben TTT death.
---
Nice, might‚Äôve gotten an ace if Sledge didn‚Äôt quit
---
Because this sub is as refined as the game
---
That was fuze's job! üòÇ

‚ÄúMind your phrasing‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up with this‚Äù even though you know what is up with it.

I'm legitimately trying to understand what you're talking about here. Siege releases new seasons, maps (or reworked maps), operators, and constant balancing/game update every three(ish) months.  
---
But according to you we "don't get shit from them in a gameplay perspective."  
---
How does that make any sesnse?
---
First two kills were a beaut
---
this looks like a buff warden to me
---
she dead lol
---
Why did they give guns to kids?)
---
FuCk OfF!
---
Pretyy interesting. I may have to do it with my friends some time.
---
Thank you for the idea!

I want to see Dr. Disrespect do it. He even has the Google prototype scopes.

/WHY
---
F6
---
I didn't say he was op or game breaking. He's just a very good anchor between his site destruction,  area denial, and his 2 primaries.
---
No, they aren't diamond and plat bans. They are PRO LEAGUE bans. Pro League operates on a completely different scale than diamond and platinum ranked does. They are all incredibly strong aimers, are unmatched in map and operator knowledge, have a consistent ability to gather / understand intel and perhaps the strongest part of pro league is the team coordination. Team Coordination, which COMPLETELY shuts down the strength of operators like Jackal and Cav removing the need to waste a ban on them. Ranked is, for all intents and purposes, a different game than pro league is.
---
The win rate / pick rate charts that goobisoft releases are an aggregate average of every site on every map in the ranked rotation. The most recent set also spoils the numbers by including ban rates into pick rates. If you legitimately think that the two charts are the same, then you are critically misinformed.
---
Well I mean R6 is such a close range game that a scope more than 2.5x is almost unusable in some cases

People already buy the season pass, so they won‚Äôt add more to it beyond maybe a discount or maybe increased progress. Battle pass will be like $10 and act as a middle ground for players not ready to go full season pass but want more rewards
---
Probably just people being shitty.
---
Probably on his way to kill some Hong Kong protestors.
---
Stop lookin at the CAM-RS am I right
---
Gotta agree. Nokk doesnt need a buff, shes 0retty well balanced.
---
bears. beets. battlestar galactica.
---
Clash is really some of the ops who need more cosmetics. I mean,even Maverick got some more cosmetics,even was part of the showdown event,so why can't Clash get some more outfits and weapon skins.
---
I would love buying  a skin which dresses her up in a vintage British Lady style,a dress as uniform wouldn't be bad considering she has a shield which makes her loud and slow already so bright colours wouldn't give a disadvantage to her.

i get that, i was saying it in a sense of, he didnt need changing.  but im also emotional with this loss to my boy, and this is more of a cry for help.
---
Nah, i've played conan so i guess it something similar, but it's not competitive and have no ranked play. Don't get me wrong i really like this game and enjoy it a lot with my friends, but pretty often ppl in my or enemy team  just...well u know :D Often ppl dc from my or enemy team because there is no real punishment for it too. It's kind a stupid.

It's the ultimate uno reverse card

That guy in the back middle in the gamescon shirt looks so worried lol

I'm willing to give this battle pass a chance, but I'm not hoping for anything mind blowing as of now.

Honestly thought this was warden with someones face photoshopped on lmao
---
Oh ok, cool
---
Nah it's not, it resembles a lot the bluish color the SAS used to have as their uniforms a while ago.
---
I think the mpx is pretty good.
---
I put it on pistols so I can panic spam them.
---
I like it
---
Go curl up into a ball in piss into your own mouth you racist
---
you can't know the difference between losing connection or just disabling internet connection so i don't think there's a way to change this penalty.
---
Word. Well if you do play rust you will see ultimate levels of toxins.
---
wait, that's illegal
---
Even if that‚Äôs true, Glaz‚Äôs gun does not need special treatment
---
Fuck you. Credit the original cosplayer you fucking monster. Suck a cock
---
GAAAAAAAHDAMN
---
Use periods. Please.
---
Damn, you have the pose down pat. Great job!
---
GL to you too.
---
smh
---
Oh that‚Äôs funny ! MICHEAL !
---
if it was the same case in 3rd person,that skin would be a p2win in certain maps lol
---
When your hip fire is better than your actual aim
---
not scientifically possible
---
It's pretty much personal preference. I put a laser on my pistols and shotguns. Keep in mind that when using a shotgun you should position yourself to where the laser can't be seen.
---
And why is that? I'm mid gold and I have never found when I was matched against plats that there was a severe skill gap? Mabye your just not as good as you think you are?
---
I agree, but rainbow is a much more condensed experience, which makes all the toxicity feel like so much more. 
---
Plus there are literally nights where I get team killed the first few matches of the night, and it makes me shut off the game and load up something else.
---
lesion?
---
At least then offer me the chance to reconnect immediately, but they don't do that even
---
 That Blackbeard looks like he was cropped in from the actual game lol
---
You must be really desperate
---
how about you fix your internet instead and it won‚Äôt be an issue
---
Ubi can't do anything,it's all on Microsoft and Sony.
---
fuck weebs
---
Nice picture! I've never seen this many cosplays at once.
---
I wish there is something done. This ruins my siege experience.

The guys just trying to find new people to play with grow up man

buff warden

Looks great! Nice operator choice :)
---
Oh hahah look guy it‚Äôs an office reference!! See guys I watch the office just like y‚Äôall. Hopefully o will get some upvotes because people that Watch the office will get it :) hahaha the office
---
yeah, that's a solvable problem.
---
I know what you mean. After 10p is when the real cancer comes out on R6 I got TK‚Äôd 3 times when I was playing yesterday, because I wasn‚Äôt in some peoples squad I‚Äôve never met discord
---
24 hours is ridiculous. I payed the sixty dollars to play the game. If I want to leave a match because of a NUMBER of reasons then I will.
---
I'm less concerned about your aim, more concerned about thiers.
---
This is the ultimate repost

Lookin fresh

You waited 1 day before stealing someone else's post

Maybe just a Ying main on the other team
