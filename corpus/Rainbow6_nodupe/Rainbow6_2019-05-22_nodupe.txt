---
Just get a mute on ur team man hahha not that hard to counter twitch on chalet
---
Unless the advantage is crippling than there is no excuse as to why it shouldn‚Äôt be in ranked.
---

---
Learn to adapt and make the most of the given situation instead of bitching and crying for shit to be removed unless, again, if the advantage cripples the other team badly (aka: Favela for defenders). 
---
You can‚Äôt call yourself a pro siege player if you aren‚Äôt good or great at every aspect of the game. Not everything is gonna be perfectly balanced (bomb isn‚Äôt perfectly balanced either) so using the whole (but it‚Äôs unbalanced) is a moot point unless the advantage, is again, crippling the receiving team.
---
Lol i know but i was trapped haha no where to go
---
:/

His victory animation of him ripping one fat bong for 6 whole minutes straight was a bit much, personally.

He's really situational. I would give him 4 panels

It‚Äôs sad this is funny smh...racism is still racism even subtly ...it‚Äôs like laughing at someone handicap and saying you didn‚Äôt mean too.... community truly is trash and the mods in this sub are as well
---
Hes not supposed to close up the room. Hes supposed to funnel people and convince them to go other routes.
---
*reported*
---
Best thing about this skin: Look at how goddamn easy to COSPLAY that would be!
---
Honestly, as much as I would have preferred some WWI trench gear with a turn-of-the-century chemical hood to boot, this right here is gonna make my main man Smonk cost less than 600$ to cosplay well. For that, I am happy.
---

---
This oddly makes me think Hibana would make a good Mulan.
---
yes i do
---
yet can be helpful for teamwork,nothing is easier than killing an enemy who can't see anything
---
No I like the redesigned album ui better
---
Wait, isn't 3 round rotations where one can go the entire game on only either attack or defense? Won't it be fair if everyone has an equal opportunity to do both?
---
So have you done the push to do the speak
---
At least ban kaid to make it even tho, if it‚Äôs anyone else my OCD will be nettled
---
True. I think we were probably running an Mira/Echo/Lesion/Jager/Bandit. I rarely play Mira so that's why my loadouts are goofy sometimes.
---
Should have added it this season but I guess someone wanted to see it completely full first
---
Sad
---
Stat wise it's the strongest weapon btw
---
Underrated my ass, I hate his armor panels bc all they do is keep me from destroying fuze charges/breach charges, etc on the other side. Also anyone I hear walking around outside the panel I can't do anything about, most useless shit ever.
---
Lol gold rand
---
Ouch, reaaally not feeling this one. The fun of playing smoke is being able to strike fear into the enemy by roaming with a shotgun and catching them off guard, and his mysterious design really adds to the effect. I personally use the hound mask and play like a psycho for massive amounts of fun, but this skin would only serve to hurt that. Not really freaky or cool, just very in-your-face punk. Maybe some people will like this, me personally it's a definite not buy and believe me I've bought some bland elite skins in the past.
---
I'm thinking more of a football hooligan.
---
The uh.... sonic picture
---
I prefer 1080p
---
I mean Finka's Spear was a new gun and everybody stopped using it after they realized the LMG was just better. I guess if you just want something new for a couple weeks then I understand, but personally I care way less about operators' guns than the effect they have on the meta.
---
yes i do but nothing comes out nor can i hear my team  mates when they are speaking
---
Orrrr allow all operators be ban able bc in reality it‚Äôs the right thing to do.
---
So what does it matter if the new ops get banned?
---
Ahh Blackbeard, my favorite operator from black ice
---
Blackbeard black ice
---
I love black ice
---
Are all your wires plugged in correctly?
---
Pretty sure every map has April 14th circled on a calendar. "Max distance" makes me believe it'll be more of a Zipline type deal. Maybe one ammo that can be picked up. Shoot a horizontal lines that covers the outside of an entire floor and all th attackers can use it
---
1. Why doesn't twitch count? Also, going above and shooting the damn denial works too lol. 
---
2. This is literally what everyone said about 3 minute timer in ranked and the ranked map pool. Guess what? The changes ended up being great and made ranked much better. Play the game before saying these changes are "flat out stupid". 
---
3. You're out of your mind if you think the same meta goes on every round. Some Mira setups are default but the vast majority of games and rounds play out very differently from one another. If you think the same ops are banned, the most important factor in pick and ban is the preference of the individual teams which vary team to team.
---
All this complaining about banning the new ops. Get over it. It‚Äôs a feature and they are allowed to do it.
---
No u
---
Right! Or maybe in GR Breakpoint for a post launch op, you learn one of Rainbow got stranded on the island with you and you have to find and save them. Or, since Breakpoint is gonna have a pretty big tech focus, maybe we learn Skrell developed some Division tech like they did Rainbow‚Äôs drones and things like that. It doesn‚Äôt always have to involve team Rainbow, but just make this universe more interconnected.
---
agreed
---
That mf really be starin üò≥üò≥üò≥
---
Dude nobody cares.
---
I need the link to that
---
Yup probably getting it next season
---
What is ts
---
This is why no one takes this sub seriously
---
It‚Äôs actually not because people payed to use them exclusively for a week. Balance wise it would be the ‚Äúright thing to do‚Äù if they were op, but there not. And even if they were op it still shouldn‚Äôt be a thing cuz people spent money on it.
---
You don‚Äôt have to play ranked secure area. That‚Äôs what I don‚Äôt understand.  This change does not impact bomb players at all. I‚Äôve played this game on and off since the game has come out. I really only play secure area. How is it fair that I have to get thrown into a whole another game mode I‚Äôm not used to. Makes no sense. ‚ÄúYou can play casual.‚Äù Casual is terrible and people fuck around too much. I really do not understand how people can be for this.
---
you tell me, why do some guys want to be girls or the other way around
---
It is like in pro league you can go to match point on one side.
---
Missed opportunity for May the fourth

25,000 renown or $5 each

He's 36 in game. The game updates the age in real time. He was born in 1983 so I don't think the website updated his birthday.

Yeah

Sure all art is welcome...buuut... You should probaly look with someone with more power

I'm gonna leave this here for you buddy

So glad they didnt go with the helmet for IQ.
---
Because of this one post?
---
Then don't play them
---
Top left ? Looks like "Main Exe. (Explosive?) Kinetic"
---
Shoo
---
Not going to link or mention any of them???
---
I bought valk for the hair and the hair alone
---
Perfectly balanced
---
Me and my friends like secure area and hostage because in bomb there's a lot more pressure and less room for the unexpected. I feel like lowering the possible options only hurt the people who want to just have fun. Everyone plays differently in each mode and I feel like they are trying to make everyone play like a pro when most just want to have fun, and in the end isn't that the whole point of games in general?
---
The first few seasons of spongebob are pretty good even if you‚Äôre not a kid, but it definitely is a show that started strong and progressively got worse
---
for anyone interested the elite name is Red Arsenic
---
It was the season final, not the Invitational or the Major
---
It really annoys me that they gave the new ops recycled guns. I mean at least just reskin the MPX or the FMG-9. The guns are my favorite part of the new operations lol
---
I ship it.
---
Wow thats terrible.
---
LOL, it was probably two games with a hacker, one was one, one was lost. The difference between the mmr gains/loss was -2 so they gave you back 2 mmr. It's to keep the balance of the mmr system and not cause inflation.
---
Not going to miss this Maestro outfit
---
Its coming into the new season, The TTS (Technical Test Server) comes out a couple days after release of new season but only on PC
---
It want *literally* a bucket.
---
What kind of aimbot is this ?
---
Hehe... nikker
---
What do you think a ranked playlist is supposed to be? It's supposed to be the most competitive and balanced version of the game.
---
Invitationals are only at the beginning of the year. The event last weekend was a pro league season final I believe
---
You got them eyes tho
---
Nobody cares kid
---
I feel like the bomb spots aren't always the best and with secure its not as sweaty. I also think you will find more throwers with bomb only
---
If they're going that path they'd better give Mozzie [this one](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcQQudYsSRFWzsmr0fDSSiiGw6R27XQ1-yQgnKGQyK2OTRQc1tZ8)
---
Im so glad this got cleared up. I've been dying to know what Nokk meant.
---
they‚Äôre here to save the day
---
That rook looks like poob
---
Yes, that same slight shrugging of the shoulders that's been since the beginning.  And the elite sets introduced the new ones to mix it up.  But as I suggested, for those operators with no elite set yet, or for those players who can't or won't buy elite sets, something to change it up a bit would be nice but not crucial.  Something a little simpler like a salute or weapon check would be neat, and less flashy than the elite sets which are usually more animated and sometimes have those extra effects with them (not all of them do, like Sledge who just twirls the hammer).
---
It‚Äôs just the egirl wings man
---
Stop writing my thoughts.
---
PC only, it'll be available on your uplay or steam
---
You can't understand why a RANKED playlist shouldn't have unbalanced game modes.
---
imo the shield should only be extended while zapping and should be collapsed otherwise
---
But still
---
Toxic is as toxic does
---
How do you have reversed friendly fire on thunt?
---
Ph come on that glaze looks like a tf2 sniper
---
Even so, what would it matter?
---
idk, it just seemed like Twitch also didn't know who he was either. Just a weird comment to make.
---
yeah, this definitely should've been reserved for the Invitational 2020 collection instead of his elite, I won't dispute that. But I don't hate it as much as I probably should, so it's something.
---
I'll slide in it which ever it is
---
It's so cute.

Yeah i agree, they could of given her such a cool ass new smg to use. But eh, im kinda enjoying the FMG-9 atm. But hey, they gave mute the SMG-11 so we never know what ubi might add in the future.
---
So being black is a handicap?

I gotta push for diamond now so I can get a blur balled kangaroo

I laughed waaay too hard at this.

That last banned defender is gonna be Echo. Just accept the inevitable.
---
Claymore's have also been removed.
---
Yes they temoved it because of the glitches along with deployable shield and clash
---
That‚Äôs just Ron Swanson in a suit, you can‚Äôt fool me.
---
Because she was supposed to and instead of spending time and money changing the model they said fuck it well fix it layer, odds are it will change with launch
---
Yes sir
---
Unless I‚Äôm wrong they removed them along with clash and deployable shields
---
What's this guys user? I see his leaks all the time
---
yes it does, if a copper hosts you are more likely to get placed with low ranks and vise versa. but to doesnt really matter because everyone does this to boost MMR
---
Too bad his gadget is invisible
---
It certainly is
---
He is fourth operator in, can you not see the one and only LORD TACHANKA!
---
that like year 1 spawn. its not going to be added

So her name is William Barr?

Anybody?

Oh no it‚Äôs an egirl

Yea, you‚Äôre right about that, lemme edit that real quick

Statistically the AUG is both worse and used less
---
Poor dude can‚Äôt roll anymore :(
---
 Think I speak for all season pass holders when I say that the new ops should not be able to be banned for the first week of a new season. This is a real issue for people who pay to use them early.
---
But don't get me wrong I LOVE pick and ban! Now I don't gotta face Monty abusers anymore!!
---
I know a guy who can get rid of nekkers for you
---
Oh it‚Äôs a mute main, he knows all. I don‚Äôt know what crawled up your behind buddy but I‚Äôm asking for feedback. I‚Äôm not whining and saying this shouldn‚Äôt be in the season, nor am I trying to knock the communities designs. I am simply asking for feedback and what other people think. Furthermore this is my favorite game I‚Äôve ever played; that being stated, I enjoy it. I‚Äôm sorry I am not as active as you are on this subreddit. Please take your feeble mind, ignorance, and arrogance elsewhere you prepubescent tween. You‚Äôre the person that gives this community a bad name. You didn‚Äôt need to say anything at all. Your bed time is approaching.
---
/s?
---
I fookin‚Äô love the skin! I hope they don‚Äôt change it
---
It's a some guy on twitter from Japan. I'll try to find how his @ for you. He also has a youtube channel.

Castle main here, I barrice two commonly use entry points and save the last one for emergencies
---
Yo is this the CGI recreation of Steel Ball Run?
---
No, but mute's the youngest yet has WW1 gear.
---
seems less of a "mixture of iq jackal and warden" and more of just a defending iq and doesnt really seem that good as all of the attacking gadgets have audio cues that tell you they are being activated/placed
---
shoot the hostage oopsie
---
I don't really like how they changed from light blue to pink but hey, it's not like I'm ever going to get there
---
"What's in the canister? I'd have to kill you to find out... Just relax, I'm joking..."
---
I mean, as long as you hit the headshot it doesn't matter what you use. I also prefer the 417 over the Famas.
---
Damn it, didn't think of this... 
---
But it would actually be dumb to ban the new ops, not many people will have learned to use them to their full potential yet, so it would be easier to win over the new ones, I guess.
---
Lmao

This isn‚Äôt great but Ash‚Äôs Elite is still the worst by a mile.
---
Oh Lord have mercy.. Surely this is Halloween stuff right? I mean, Halloween is all about costumes and such.
---
the watermark is toxic
---
Cus your missing your shots?
---
Or they're dumb because they wont learn how to use them if they never do
---
I doubt they'll change it. If you look at IQ's operator intro. She has the FBI shotgun i believe. And no shotgun in game :c
---
It's wasn't anything that could be stopped they have their lives for something they saw very worthy and I agree with their decision
---
Is there a way to tell who's doing that? It happened twice to me in 3 games today
---
I feel like the gas can is gonna be like an explosive capitao barrel basically and the rappel gun is gonna be shot on the underside of the hatch and the op will climb up through.
---
Casual is legit a really good way to learn how to play new ops. 
---
You just pick them *every time*, and you'll get used to what their strengths and weaknesses are. I did this with Capitao and IQ, and now they're both my mains.
---
I loved secure area...
---
I hope I'm not getting bamboozled here because that's great news
---
type in CS, when you take the Bot command
---
Why Hostage draw is won by the defense? If the building is surrounded by the authorities, having eliminated the whole defending team would be an attacker victory.
---
Capit√£o sttaight up looking like baiano

It would explain Capita√µ's new fire mechanic

I officially Ban myself from this reddit post.  Ban phase Complete!

They had extra time with the uniform since they refused the guns lol
---
i dont know what to make of this
---
Okay makes sense
---
Not sure but it‚Äôs been happening to me too. I‚Äôm bronze3. I did find that playing a casual match then going back to ranked I found a match quicker idk why tho
---
Thanks for the laugh man

Can we all agree that recruits should get to put skins on their weapons üòÇ

It‚Äôs the dark eyes, blue eyed cavs never look right

How on earth would "noncompetitive" not be such thing with the overtime rules? When with the extremely attacker sided meta (broken Glaz, later Lion times) a lot of pro league (and I think even ranked) matches were decided by a coinflip: who gets to attack first on overtime. Its not so competitive and fun when there is a such a random factor in your match.
---
Pro League has solved this issue by making draws at 6-6, but that coinflip still exist on the LAN at the end of the season (exception is the final match with the infinite overtime rule ofc). Fortunately with pick&amp;ban and balanced maps, teams have roughly have the same chance of winning regardless of the coinflip.
---
What, you've never been jumpscared by a plant before?
---
This reminds me of a very specific and famous image. Anyways cool skin and all but not really what I was expecting. I much preferred the WW2 theme.
---
I think it‚Äôs the even number of ops on both sides
---
At least the r4c is better than the fmg9 üôÑ
---
Because there‚Äôs that one person who will tk if they don‚Äôt get the new ops
---
You're not. You can rip down his barricades and Castle will get another barricade to put up, but if you destroy them, he doesn't get it back.
---
Stop
---
Right? They usually look scarier and more annoying in the trailer than in the actual game.
---
The way the fire spreads in Cap's bolt has been reworked, it was probably to future proof it for this gas can concept.
---
You savage, you.
---
This is fantastic
---
sorry about my typing
---
i bs‚Äôd my way through these 3 long and painful years, i barely know what a handful of those words are lol, i can tell you the principle parts and whatnot for most of the words tho
---
Bruh
---
Seems likely
---
I didnt know it was reworked! Thanks for the info! It definitely would make sense!
---
The Glaz one is sick! I need that now.
---
so would it be the 2nd/3rd for the people with the season pass? or is that just the release of the operation.
---
What do you mean, my friend?
---
Did Maverick steal Lesion's toothpick?
---
Where is the dude that was running around the leak spamming and claiming the FMG-9 is a place holder for Nokk :D
---
It's just the same key as throwing it - the only way to tell how your model holds it. It will switch from a throwing stance to having your hand on top, like in the gif.
---
yikes.

The order of Castle still remains intact my friend, plus I don't really find interest in much ops except for rook Tbh because he's a team player and the shotty is beautiful
---
This is top tier
---
Damn dude, you might wanna practice in some Thunts. This is really hard to watch haha
---
A bot most likely. they rip popular images and throw them on shirts.
---
It actually says in the rules no memes allowed. I made a doge meme that said I can‚Äôt wait to play clash on  May 18 2019. Removed. N√∏kk translates to nikker. Front page. Not that I don‚Äôt like your meme, but come on. Let me post
---
Well the reason that I like Thermite better is because his thermal charge creates a bigger hole, and takes less time to detonate, but Hibana is better when it comes to range since she can fire the pellets from a distance and she's better for hatches. I also like Thermite better because of his AR. His AR gets 31 rounds unlike Hibana which gets 21. Hibana however does get get a better secondary since she gets the choice between a handgun and an smg. So, each operator is better for different for different things, but in my experience of using the two, I like playing Thermite better.
---
I just passed my finals and got my moment of relief today, welp, onto the next tests.
---
Spicy spawn peeking
---
Drug
---
It would be the same because 90% of diamond console players use MnK.
---
So what‚Äôs the ETA on having 100 operators? Anybody wanna do the math? I‚Äôm lazy
---
Honestly, it‚Äôs not, in my console experience this guys aim is at a copper or bronze level. This is extremely bad even on console. Up in the platinum area almost everyone has really good aim, or they‚Äôre using MNK (fuck you if you use one btw)
---
It was like this last season.
---
It's not bad, but it's not good
---
So and Irish mozzie mixed with sekiro‚Äôs prosthetic arm
---
No
---
i forgot they banned memes tbh, even though most of what i see are just small gameplay bits, i guess they just dont like template memes, which is understandable
---
That is so sad
---
cries in too broke to get valk
---
I hope the buff the recoil from Ela's Scorpion Evo 3 A1
---
Package 123
---
She also varies that with "As my friend would say, big fucking hole coming right up" or some variation of it.
---
What is a trash camper? Like, thats the point of the game. Like its not run around in circles, its SIEGE. One team attacks and the other defends. Defending, aka camping in the objective. Again, point of the game.
---
 They need to go back to COD.
---
My redeeming qualities in siege are as follows: I'm pretty ok and spawn peeking, I'm a god at counter spawn peeking, I scream a lot in cqc when I get scared, and I'm pretty good at clutching
---
Hoes mad
---
yeah true, the more I look at it the more I kinda grow fond of it but I'm still cut that it isn't a plague doctor
---
Who are those people asking to grind ranks more?
---
Yeah I‚Äôll just interrogate my own exam for answers
---
what
---
Back right on the chalkboard guys. It seems to be a grappling hook and a jerry can. What do you guys think these are for?
---
1. That isn't relevant to this post.
---
2. Yes. Everyone noticed.
---
That was my exact though here
---
Is that a Buster Scruggs reference
---
who would pay money for that??
---
Mostly pro league players, they say diamond is too easy to achieve and there‚Äôs no challenge...

Just play with what you want man, I play with 50 50 sensitivity and I have no issues. It lets me actually turn around and make quick movements if necessary. While not being to high to lose the ability to be precise
---
I don't think that a plague doctor skin would have worked, but they for sure could have done something from like WWII

Castle rework when

Smoke is literally the worst elite in every way. lol

im more annoyed at recycling weapons, you can make all the skins to make money, but you need to have content as well, not just skins

A lot of people are bad at shooting Monty in the face, so most Monty players get used to having plenty of time to fight back. He was pretty close though so a simple tap tap with the non-ads probably would give a headshot but legit, in lower levels shields are impossible to deal with (since you are too bad to hit heads). One of the bigger reasons why Blitz is annoying.
---
yeah I agree I was really hoping for something closer to the fuze elite to be honest
---
"Oh wait I have a second drone!?"
---
‚ÄúSurprise, motherfucker!‚Äù
---

---
Frost because I like her shotty and it forces me to play clever with her trap placements
---
Nomad because Caveira scares me
---
The Fuze elite is my favorite elite in the game, and if they would have done something sort of like that that would have been awesome
---
Dang, was really hoping for hitler on this one not gonna lie

Top right grapple gun gaget for y4s3 attack

If you lost 57 then that means you gained 57. Most likely you won‚Äôt the game because of the cheater on your team. If a cheater is present then the system nullifies the game as it should be. If you‚Äôre encountering this many on your team in a solo qeue then you should also be gaining ELO from playing against cheaters at a similar frequency. 
---
I don‚Äôt understand how you can be mad that you‚Äôre not allowed to keep ELO that you got from playing with cheaters. They may not be god tier carrying but they‚Äôre doing enough to have secured the win. I hope you realize that if you play with a cheater and lose that you get the ELO back. If a cheater is present than any ELO fluctuation whether positive or negative is undone.

Even if the cheater lost the game against you it will still take the elo back. So losing rating from it doesn't mean it's a closet cheater on your side. Could be a white knight cheater on the other team that didn't toggle at all.

Have they done this for most elites? I love that elites are more focused on lore now.

---
Hello there!

Hey, depends.

If you are spam clicking, then yes, you are depriving others of the chance to test. If you are not and in fact have some 3-4 seconds before you click, then no, they are just slow or disinterested.
---
Stop right this instant
---
I agree that a plague doctor skin wouldn't be good for an elite, because it would just be so expected, but this elite skin isn't too great either. Idk, I don't exactly hate the skin, but for Smoke, I just don't think it fits.
---
You can alternate each other round
---
General Reposti!
---
If that IS really the elite, then this is the first elite that I absolutely do not like.

Do you all agree that all the operators feel a bit more slow or "chunky"?

I feel like now with claymore removed, it's far more likely for people to choose breaching charges.  
---
I agree that Castle has his uses, but at the moment almost everyone is countering him.
---
What you take for hitreg issues might be that the sights are misaligned sometimes, they're working for a fix for that. 
---
And some hitboxes are kinda misleading, blackbeards tophat for example, and GSG9s heads.

I fixed it by using the ini file. I would go into specifically display and it would slow down, then I just couldn‚Äôt get to the right resolution. It would essentially freeze.
---
ofc it is
---
I‚Äôm also a pretty big fan of this
---
Its still 4-3 or 5-3OT to win. 
---
Team A plays 3 defense rounds and then switch to 3 rounds of attack, first team to 4 round wins or 5-3 if overtime is active wins the match.
---
That's also true. But for some reason, you don't get an insta down even with 1 shot in  15m range.
---
I‚Äôm worry to alarm you but 51 ops including recruit
---
Aromaticity still exists. It is about 40% as aromatic as furan or pyrrole, to which it is related.
---
Frost but with better eyeliner!!
---
I don't understand how I'm supporting you. My point is that people should have the choice to play the game mode they want. They should not remove Secure Area just to make it more like pro league. At the end of the day a video game is about having fun, and taking that game mode way restricts people's ability to have fun. If your version of fun is a competitive environment where it mirrors Pro League, then grab your friends and go play Go4R6, you play against people that are like-minded, and it is literally the PL Rules.  
---
If you don't want to play Go4, accept that people will want to play Secure Area, get to Diamond and then troll around. What do you expect with the internet? By playing you're pretty much accepting that there are trolls, hackers and (if on console) Keyboard/Mouse Players. I don't agree with the people I listed just then, but I just do what I can and move on. No point in getting angry about something you cannot control.
---
I don‚Äôt get why this guy cares so much about a skin haha- just live your life man chillax
---
Disappointed his elite wasn‚Äôt a Auschwitz guard
---
Sprays the locker room with axe and everyone dies, the end.
---
Call me an idiot, but what does TS specifically stand for? Based on context clues, I'm pretty sure it refers to the testing periods, so does it stand for "Test Servers" or some shit?
---
Nice
---
Why so toxic?
---
it‚Äôs called dostoevsky
---
Yeah like if the defenders like to roam a lot you can immediately switch as a team to a more anti roam setup. 
---
Or if you are defense and you lose a close 1v1 on a semi random chance, you can redo the same setup immediately but with small changes to counter the attacks while the attackers can also make small changes. 
---
Right now on rank you need setup for a attack, then defense, then attack all while trying to remember what type of gameplay the other team likes, different strats, remembering the strat changes you need to make etc.. this is more straightforward.
---
They're dummy useful, that's why they ban them in ranked my guy
---
How did nobody say anything in chat??
---
Lol, after I changed from secure to bomb, I have been nothing but Diamond rank. Feels so much easier because people are just around like headless chickens.
---
You forgot Gridlock and Mozzie they are also both balanced they were right in the middle of the graph mid season.
---
My toughts
---
yes. too many newbies/low ranks barricade everything
---
Don't worry about it. Sometimes I'll make the mistake myself but with Tower, it's like I play that map so often on casual for some reason (constantly in the rotation lol) that one little sign or furniture and I'll be able to tell what room and map it's on.
---
Had this for a while, but tried later... It worked
---
I never play it at all.

Perfect. ;)
---
To all people that said it's not a bad gun. 
---
Compare to every other attacking gun in the game (not shotgun) it is by far the worst and it doesn't have an acog. It is an okay SMG but it is just underwhelming. It's hard to win gunfights with it. Now this kinda introduces and aim skill gap which one could argue is good, but it just seems very unfair. It's just my opinion tho. Just in the past it has shown poorly when the defenders have a clear gun advantage over the attackers (Jager with acog, mp5, maeatros lmg, and more have all been nerfed to make this easier for attackers to deal with.
---
üëå
---
This map and a few others get repeated so often for me on casual.
---
I saw other operaters wearing the western style cosmetics. Maybe this is gonna be the next events like April fools one?

Face.. paint? That's not just her face?

Aw whaaaaat

To be fair I always preferred Bomb to Secure area. Feels more tactical and balanced as there are two sites to defend and attack
---
because of your name you opinion does not matter

that glaz looks puny, he (or she) requires more Russian potatoes for growth

Sure, but still his pixels ain't getting older.

How do you get the [operator] main thing
---
for a multi-billion dollar company it does have one of the slowest website and network back-ends of any game distributor.
---
Yeah probably
---
where's the connection?
---
Thanks...I hate it
---
no
---
I agree. He's not nearly as good as other anchors and literally the counter to him is just, don't bring smokes or flashes. His gadget is just super situational. If he was a 1 or 2 speed, I could see his gadget getting a bit more use and he would probably be more useful in general, but this current state isn't very good for him.
---
Looks like a british hooligan to me
---
Tbh that chunks charm looks real good.
---
Hairspray apparently.
---
Then when they throw their smokes and flashes to plant, they will die. FOREVER.
---
If this skin is Western-themed like the other leaked skin, Rook is wearing a very rudimental bulletproof armor
---
It's so annoying when that happens
---
Not likely, every time I play ranked I get the same 4-5 maps. There's no variety.

Yeah I had to slow the video down to figure out how I killed 3 within a second after I c4 the first and spent two seconds trying not to die from flaming bolts and a spraying lmg only to land a lucky one tap to the head this all went down in 10 seconds.

A guy with an acog turret and a shield that takes as many bullets to break as it does to kill him isn‚Äôt a problem?

Don‚Äôt like it. Actually hate it.

Yes, but the fmg 9 will have mozzies holo sight

They made new pro league sets for the original ops. The old sets have gold chibis, that's why these aren't gold. but I don't see anything wrong with it.. i actually think they look better than the gold ones.

i need his gaming socks

I want it simply because of the fact it‚Äôs so bad it‚Äôs good.

---
oh that explains it, cos this happened while plsying twitch
---
me pretty 
---
look at me me me me
---
Yeah she doesn't have an acog on the tts. They added a new scope into the fmg9 which also got added to smoke.
---
They added a suppressor into the Deagle which got added into the valk and BB load out
---
No better way to procrastinate.
---
No you literally can not. The way the game code ways, if you have 2 operators that use the same gun, if you make a change to the gun both operators will get the change.
---
Missed opportunity. Do you know how much money Ubi would make if it was a plague doctor? Bank.
---
Bronn!
---
Wow the Australian servers must be turn upside down

Bots are slow and usually seem confused because code isn't perfect. So when people see an indecisive player they call them a bot. You know those people who sprint up stairs just to run back down and then they come straight back up? Yeah those people.

This is exciting but 4 months early,? And he's using the Spear 308 nobody has noticed Finka uses and the PMM, The spear is a weak gun like the FMG-9 so they really aren't giving new operators new guns damn, hoping he gets another secondary handgun from another CTU, I wish it was a grapple gun though
---
if that's the case I see the female defender getting guns like Hibana and Echo's handgun, the German shotgun or FBI shotgun nobody uses and the P90 SMG that barely anyone uses. (example)
---
It's not his, the artist is on twitter
---
Because most of the old elites are fucking cool,unique and have effort put into them.

This is guy in a fucking parka.

The elites are getting worse.

Don't they buy them because they look cool? If I buy an Elite Skin, it's because I like it, even if maybe 1 out of 30 players won't see it.

---
Best is very subjective.  For instance, I'm not a big fan of Oregon, but I know full well it would be one of the meta maps if selection was possible.
---
Players in Siege have demonstrated that the most balanced maps don't always rise to the top in popularity.  There was a time when the most balanced maps were Yacht and Kanal at a time when players were begging Ubisoft to remove them from the ranked map pool.  Also, since Ubisoft doesn't publish map win rates very often (and I haven't seen them in over a year), players don't really know which maps are balanced or not.  They only have their own anecdotal experience which brings in a myriad of other factors; it's possible their team stubbornly sticks with a subpar strategy (or a strategy their team is ill equipped to execute) on a specific map leading them to more frequent losses on that map.
---
Also, would DLC maps ever get played in ranked?  All three of the DLC maps included in the pro map pool were at a minimum disliked at launch and Villa is still a 50/50 map at best with players.  While players might give those maps a chance at the start of a season, within a few weeks once the popular opinion prevails that the map sucks it would likely be cut from the list.
---
Even current Kafe is an interesting situation to look at.  That map is disliked by in large because of the terrible first floor bomb site, which is completely understandable; however, does that truly make the map imbalanced?  I'm not so sure.  Both the bar and mining sites feel pretty well balanced to me (again having not seen win rates in quite a while).  Seeing as overtime only imposes two distinct sites at most, the fact that the first floor site is basically unwinnable for defenders with evenly matched teams and conventional strategies wouldn't give one team an unfair advantage.  The only way both teams will defend that site is if they their first two defenses; while not the most compelling gameplay experience to basically know you're going to overtime at that 2-2 round, both teams have an even shot of winning their attack round on that site and then the overtime rounds will be on the more balanced choices.
---
As far as I'm concerned, I want as big of a map pool as possible with all the reasonably balanced maps.  The game can get monotonous quickly if the same small set of maps are played.  Any map that is statistically imbalanced (more than say 10% since perfect balance is essentially impossible) shouldn't be a part of the ranked pool.  But the moment you put selection into the hands of the players, the maps that get played are nothing but a popularity contest and exercise in groupthink, not any kind of objective decision on the most compelling maps to play.
---
But you don't even see the uniform until the endgame screen shows up. As a guy who has more than 10 elites I can confirm, I buy them to show off.
---
So Elite Skins are like airpods then lmao

Lol is it possible that its a glitch?

Change it in game and in your nividia profiles as it may be set stock to a lower hz, both to 240hz

Also the yellow/white squares that look like eyes are proberly for IR reflection. So that they are easier to find with nightvision for friendly forces.

THATS JUST A COSPLAY?! I thought it was her irl
---
one way to get better is post oblivious clips of yours on internet and receive critisism, learn, implement new experience to the game.
---
Damn j√§ger strikes again
---
smoke gonna kill us all
---
Lion Elite when? Ahaha anyway, my reasoning is that if this "feature" would be used by the majority of players, then that means it should be implemented. Otherwise, very few people will use it so Elite users would have nothing to worry about. Either way, it's just an option, and most of the players you'll encounter will still see your skin.
---
Yeah this is basically:

Camping: The Game

I never understand it when people complain.

The IQ skin received similar Reddit backlash but it still ended up in the game. It isn‚Äôt getting changed.

Wait , where is she ? i don't see her

\-make the site linked with a rotation in a proper position where you can rotate without beeing exposed from the main windows/door maybe with a reinforcement near it if is impossible to have a rotation not exposed,and remember that you could defend a site even not standing still in it.  
---
\-divide the tasks with your friend cover different area and use crossfire to take out enemy easily baiting them out  
---
\-remember that you should not overpeak to get a kill you can win a round playing for the time differently from secure area where if there is someone in the objective you need to kill him in order to defend the area, here on bomb if you are in a 1v1 situation on the lasts seconds and he is in site but he also doesn't have the defuser it's not a big problem you can try to hide if you are not confident on the gunfight and avoid to loose a round getting killed for nothing, play smart.  
---
\-watch proleague match or challenger league match and try to figure out why are they going to clean some area or defend some area instead of another and keep attention on what is the default plant in the site they are playing.  
---
\-play vertically, i have played some match on secure area in past and i noticed that almost no one play vertically to get out people from above or below with a buck but remember that verticality can be useful also as defenders so you can defend an entrypoint below from above or viceversa.  
---
I hope these suggestions have been useful at least a little bit.
---
I've actually done that once.
---
A Hind D?
---
RIP
---
The vast majority of the complaints are purely people complaining about getting beat or people not playing exactly like they expect.
---
Take any number of the crazier plays from the pro scene and switch the scenario to a Streamer or even a pro streaming and a decent amount of them will complain if that same stuff is used against them.
---
Seriously do people not buy cosmetics for their own enjoyment? Regardless if others see them or not? And again, it's not like they will be disabled by default, most people will still see your skins.
---
I need him
---
Cuz they probably played CS, COD or BF before R6 came out
---
yup, pretty much and paid pack skins incoming :)
---
I find the funniest insult "tryhard". 
---
People are trying to win, no? What the fuck else are you playing this game for?
---
I was thinking the same lol.
---
My brother does this, he gets a little spergy when people don't play according to what he believes are good tactics (like lying prone in the middle of a room) and still gets killed by them.
---
"WHY WAS HE EVEN THERE"
---
To kill you lol.
---
I doubt he would be given the same exact loadout as Finka. Guessing they are either placeholder weapons or this leak is fake
---
Jesus fuck Ubi is trolling Rook mains at this point. 
---
Can‚Äôt we get a Lesion Elite style armour plated Rook? Not... bucket-on-head Rook.
---
I'm a little bit confused on how you still got shot, but this is legitimate IQ play. Vulnerable, but good.
---
Cool
---
For the most of the game I see the operators arms and legs. I buy skins to show off, and skins that I like. People don‚Äôt buy fancy cars because they just ‚Äúlike them‚Äù they buy them to show off.
---
well we already have recycled weapon one....
---
I wear beats so I wouldn‚Äôt knowüí™
---
waiting for FOV ajustment command
---
recycled weapon lol
---
Your keyboard is having a rave
---
Restart
---
11/10
---
Either this is real or a very smart fake because next season is a Peruvian operator and Peru is well known for their mountain climbing
---
Just cause it's a "defender" weapon doesn't mean it isn't strong. That 416 has a TTK that lays waste to S class guns like para 308, l85a2, 552, m762, all great guns on attack.
---
It is also the best gun on defense, meaning no defense gun can outgun it.
---
If it wasn't op, IQ would have been released with that.
---
Wow. That was funny. Good job op.
---
She needs a secondary SMG like the SMG-12 or C75 auto it would make her versatile with the FMG-9.
---
I don't see pros and top streamers complaining, and those guys have know these ops for quite a while (kept quiet by the NDA of course).
---
Pros already call her powerful.
---
So like lesion's?
---
It‚Äôs his portrait that everyone wants changed back, not his ingame face
---
Jager‚Äôs carbine is pretty well on par with attacker weapons though.
---
I‚Äôd be okay if she had an MP5 or an MP7 or something, but I don‚Äôt agree with giving her an ACOG. Her kit now forces her to play a flank or roam counter, whereas if she had longer range she‚Äôd be able to stand with other entry fraggers or pressure objective which is not her designed purpose.
---
i use the reflex on both guns
---
Normal panels are the same as current panels that all defenders have, or something different?
---
If lesion and frost‚Äôs gadgets had a baby but not lethal, just pinging. So pretty annoying for people sneaking or rushing into the objective as their location is automatically pinged by the gadget, being a great help to roomers and anchors.
---
I think because ubi is reusing technique on gadgets. We have similar ping system for alibi and lion, and we have similar camera hiding system for vigil and nokk. Since vigil is now immune to lion ping, nokk will immune to alibi ping, which is a unexpected interaction I think.
---
Damn bro gross! üòÇ
---
To go beyond 90 ? Or be able to change FoV on the fly ? I'm not sure they would allow 90+ FoV as it probably breaks first person animations.
---
Not bad. A better version of alibi. Make this dude 2-2 to balance it out. 3 speed means alibi would be rendered useless.
---
There already was one headgear of him with just hair, in the "Captured" or "Ambushed" cash-only bundle.
---
Good idea.
---
But Valk has that saucy eyebrow raise
---
i really hate when i play Valk or Echo and go to a random ass corner of the map to hide there and use my cams/drones and then i'm dead because for some reason the whole enemy team decided to start clearing the building with that exact spot
---
Kills won't make you win bomb matches.
---
You can win bomb matches without killing a single person if you have the right strategies
---
Heck yeah!
---
I'm really upset to say that I don't think we will ever reach a point in time where people stop trying to play the game like it is CoD.
---
I hear the Lingo all the time. I see people rush in without ADS, immediately get killed and then the scream of "HOW??"
---
Then it's the impentience of waiting for the round to end. If it's not a respawn, they dont wait.
---
Oh and kill count. No one plays fucking Objective on CoD and I think this greedy conquest starts from there. Tons of people are more worried about getting maximum kills and jeopardizing themselves, teammates, and the match, just for a kill instead of working together to kill an enemy safely and without too many consequences. 
---
And just not utlizing abilities and gadgets. Utterly making them completely useless. If it's not a gun or grenade, it's like they don't know what it is, how to use it, or they don't know it's even there for them to use and help the team.
---
This is actually mentally helpful for keeping track. Keep it up.
---
&gt; a better weapon than j√§gers gun
---
- L85A2
---
- AUG A2
---
- 552 Commando
---
- 556xi
---
- Spear .308
---
- PARA .308
---
- M762
---
- ARX200
---
- AK74M
---
- Mk17 CQB
---
Using any of those guns against J√§ger with a 416-C (technically) puts you in a disadvantage.
---
Great title op.
---
Hahaha such an original comment this sub is so good.
---
It‚Äôs not a ddos bc they don‚Äôt have ur IP they just hit the server and you can‚Äôt do anything about it
---
I originally thought Mav returned home by surprise, like the "HERE'S JOHNNY" thing, but sadly, that's too Hollywood.

Why can't my friends be this cool.

What rank are you playing if you don't play iq for n√∏kk?

And why should they play n√∏kk if they can just play ash or twitch? they have way better weapons

Isn't yings shotgun better than lesion?

No but that would be the real life purpose.

When ur operate in the dark u can't use the same brightness and especially when using a night vision device u would be completely blind
---
There is this small FPS game where the ranked game mode(called competitive there) is almost the exact copy of the professional version of the game i don't know if you've heard about it it's called Counter Strike Global Offensive.
---
They are identical, apart from having the suppressor.

If a defender can have such a good weapon why can't an attacker?
---
I feel your pain bud. My grandfather died during Vietnam too. We also like to remember him and his service.

RIP Ngo Pham Tien.
---
did it like 10 times now. didnt work
---
To be fair. We said pistols only (no scopes) , and my college roommate later revealed that he was using Nomad‚Äôs pistol with the scope which is how he was so accurate from behind the crane while I was on the roof in cover. Karma. üòä
---
his current pannel, the bulletproof ones.
---
I think he meant normal as in his current bulletproof ones
---
I'm thinking of getting an ultrawide like that, what're your thoughts on it? And what table have you got?
---
Keep in mind you don‚Äôt need to do the entire wall, just however much you need.
---
I just got back to Siege on Friday.
---
I haven't played for over 4 or 5 months.Like I stopped playing in December mate
---
Your move.
---
The style at least without the mask would have probably fit someone like Echo much more. This is the first time since the IQ elite got leaked that I felt an elite doesn't fit the vibe the operator established.
---
This is 100% some Indian dude
---
It would be good if he could barricade over stuff that had been beached
---
The invitational one is pretty cool
---
Do you know all the maps and operators? I would say that‚Äôs a good way to start. When I first started I was running around calling out enemy positions to my teammates with things like ‚Äòred chair‚Äô or bed‚Äô because I had no clue of the maps or rooms after jumping straight into casual but eventually got used to it, it takes time.
---
what shirt??? i cant see you anywhere in the picture..
---
90+, I've stopped playing for 7 month and I don't really play casual, so i think she's not part of the actual ranked map pool.
---
\*cough an wheeze\* 
---
I will deal with this Ela main scum myself.
---
it would make her more versatile with just 1 FMG-9 to choose from because nobody will use her shotgun, She has no access to an ACOG, no AR, no smoke grenades or flashbangs a secondary SMG wouldn't kill ubi it would help her out, in a few weeks to a month people will complain she needs a new weapon or that she's weak.
---
1-It‚Äôs a competitive environment. It‚Äôs an unfair advantage to people that don‚Äôt spend actual money on the game.
---
2-If the op is overpowered on launch, that shit is pay to win.
---
*"do you like that, you fucking rarted"*
---
Accurate üëåüëå
---
There is a website called the koyo store that sells these charms too officially, but I do t know how good they are sooo..
---
Yeah the map isn‚Äôt in ranked it used to be tho. It came out longer than 7 months ago interesting how you never played it :)
---
We have like 3 different ctus with yellow tho
---
20/10
---
That could be a career
---
Yes, I played a lot on PS4 but just switched to pc. So my aim and movement is really bad and I hate playing against plat 2 in casual
---
You actually dedicated a whole account and online journal towards removing skyscraper from ranked? It‚Äôs really not that bad, just takes time adjusting to.
---
How much gamer girl pee do you drink
---
What hentai do you watch before you play a match?
---
No, it is usually under a minuet wait for casual.
---
Dont get me wrong I like the mpx and somewhat the other but I want new unique weapons to use not the same old stuff we have
---
Doesn‚Äôt always happen, more often than not you‚Äôll be up against screaming russian children who don‚Äôt even know how to anchor or roam.
---
 sorry forgot to turn off my gadget my bad
---
Very unpopular. Learn how to combat an op, like the rest of us have since year 1 when she came out.
---
bengali?
---
I see. I've never tried the newcomer playlist but it sounds like a lack of matches
---
I like the turn off the ww1 and the ww2 elites but while I have nothing against this skin(I like it) you just kind of feel like a trench warrior skin would fit better; especially since his gas looks like mustard gas. Again I really like this and I applaud the devs, this shouldn‚Äôt be one of the few elite that aren‚Äôt vintage
---
I rate this a broken marriage out of ten
---
I don't want to be forced to play IQ every single time just because of Valk cams.
---
does ur mum know u photoshop?
---
I've 100% fallen in love &lt;3
---
I know they backed off the Chinese stuff, it's more of the fact they thought about it that got me off the train
---
Mate you basically leaking her elite skin.
---
Dude. Throwing cams outside is one of the main reasons to use valk. Otherwise echo is better in every way possible
---
this retarded community will downvote you because they now accecpt reused guns  before they were complaining about it.
---
Seems about right tbh
---
How is it that the banana smoke skin from chimera would be a better elite than this.
---
this dope. my favorite character.
---
I see. I've never played newcomer, but that just sounds like a lack of matches
---
omg, that means he's gonna come out and attack us!!!111   
---
10/10
---
Risking getting voted out for being afk
---
On attack camping is almost always just someone who is too scared to take gunfights so they hide and hold angles outside. Obviously there are ways to do this at a high level but I complain about it in Ranked when there‚Äôs people just sitting outside on attack holding angles.
---
That‚Äôs understandable. Personally I‚Äôm not bothered by recycled weapons cause it‚Äôs the gadget which really matters to me but I can understand why people would rather have new guns.
---
Nice budget cosplay. Super effective.
---
No fuck trap ops
---
You don‚Äôt have to play IQ. They glow blue. And their spots are predictable.
---
Im just hoping they at least do minor modifications. Maybe turn his mask into a half-mask, or do something similar to the Shamal headgear which looked really cool.
---
ka-ka-toom toom

It was cool until I saw the fortnite gayness
---
maestros can be placed outside, echos can be placed on windows, and hacked drones can go in drone holes facing towards attackers spawn. their is a multitude of ops that can see outside. valk cams are pretty easy to see, due to the blue eye. and valk has a specific distance she can throw her cams. just use reasoning and deduction, and her cams become obsolete

I agree, I just have nothing to fill that empty space

I disagree. In Pro League, they don't even throw Valk cams outside that much because IQ is pretty much a hard counter pick. Valk is still picked. They use inside spots in Pro League.

I was thinking that too. Bengali brothers unite

Yes to this! Plague doctor would be awsome

Plague doctor mask is awesome. Maybe not as realistic as the other elites though. Maybe a future DLC bundle?

Cap wouldn‚Äôt lose power because

Valk main here and I feel the same: MPX is weak in term of damage, ROF is good, recoil is good but you need to HS to win gunfight
---
The gun is at this state because of Valk ability as intel is the most powerful tool in Siege

it's like the first thing on google.

could‚Äôve been an alternative doc elite too but oh well

Lmao sry

Should have swapped out warden with the polar express conductor
---
The reliable source that has leaked many operators before that were correct have us a hint when the leaks for nokk and warden were out, stating,'you might want to reinforce hatches on your floor'. This may have been false but a recently discovered Easter egg showed a grappling hook in the making as well as a Molotov contraption suggesting an incendiary based operator. "Ibris" may be the next operator as an icepick is depicted as the operator icon.

---
Maestro cameras are easier to find than well placed Black Eyes without an IQ on the board.  Maestro cameras cannot shift their viewport by anyone except Maestro while he's alive.  Plus, with the Thatcher and Twitch buffs it's pretty common for the attackers to have a means to take out Evil Eyes even if it is more difficult than taking out Black Eyes which are discovered.
---
Regardless, from a purely intel gathering perspective, Echo, Maestro, and Valkyrie each has strengths and weaknesses.  When one of them is banned, the decision of which to bring is fairly complex and incorporates both the intel angle as well as the play style.  If looking at just the intel gathering, Valkyrie and Maestro both can receive significant consideration.
---
Finally!
---
It‚Äôs already exists if you don‚Äôt pick an operator before the timer ends you get a random operator.
---
There's the "Harry wallpaper" as well.
---
https://i.redd.it/01tlyxd40zh21.jpg
---
There's a bunch listed but here are a few things:
---
* Valk does not like Cav - probably due to the Ghost Recon incident, which Cav did not react well to Bowman, who is a friend of Valk's.
---
* Thatcher and Clash have disdain for one another - police vs military, leftwing politics vs rightwing politics, technology vs anti-tech.
---
* Thatcher doesn't seem to like Lesion either despite them working together and going to the bar after.  He's best mates with Sledge though.
---
* Ash and Cav love hunting one another down.
---
* Despite being from the same unit, Cav and Capitao don't like one another.  Capitao is a torture victim so he probably does not approve of her methods.

What about the random choice icon?
---
I‚Äôd recommend watching either pro league or a YouTube creator called varsity gaming. If you kinda watch what they do and think about why they‚Äôre doing what they‚Äôre doing then you‚Äôll get better. Learn from how you die, think about how that person was able to kill you, why you could have done different. And how can you work what they did into your gameplay. 
---
Get_Flanked is another good creator
---
I guess just whenever they fix the exploit
---
Well you are not wrong.
---
A lot of my friends end up stuck in Gold - plat 3
---
I did too for most of my time n R6. As soon as i dropped into plat 2 with a friend we got plat 1 in the next few days. Plat 3 is like a filter. After that people communicate much more, there is less crying and shouting, generally more positive and supportive atmosphere. I hear much more NT in hight plat then anywhere else.
---
Since then i have also switched my attitude, getting less annoyed, accepting if a player just doesnt have the gamesense, just trying to work with what you have, instead of beeing toxic.
---
Sooooo..... Thatcher
---
Vigil is just Jager but shit. Like honestly if you aren't using the BOSG there's no point in playing him
---
It can work but isn't as necessary
---
Valk is a war photographer though, how is that bad?
---
Im confused.
---
Yes there is.
---
This is getting out of hand. Now there are two of them!
---
I'm glad you understand how Important this issue is.
---
Ew a wrist aimer
---
once she is fixed
---
Idk if that's true because in Wildlands, you can get recordings that lead back to people who were in the quarantine of the Division 2 trying to survive. If what you say is true, then that means Wildlands is set in a further future setting than Division 2 (which means that the world has recovered from the epidemic). That also means that Siege and Splinter Cell are now set in the further future as well because of the joint missions the Ghosts had with them.
---
It sure does suck that they took all of the modes out of TTS except ranked. I hope they add casuals and customs back
---
bruh
---
When the fix the exploits. [This](https://twitter.com/Rainbow6Game/status/1131215034242220032) is the last related communication about it.

No, they made it so you have to stand still for about 3 seconds before you are able to see through smoke.

Finka and Lion are created for the outbreak, but they actually don‚Äôt take part in the story...

Irbis might be a placeholder name, because when Maestro and Alibi leaked, Maestro was called Barrage in his unlock video.

How tf was Blackbeard Vigils student????? I mean I have basically no prior knowledge of lore and stuff, but that makes no sense to me????
---
Not really. Its a plain red/gray hoodie which everyone wears. At least IQ had straps that add flair to the simple costume shes wearing.
---
Yeah I'm kinda in the same boat. If I'm paying extra for something special then it should actually be something neat and special.
---
The elite we will get should be Clash elite to refer to her past or sumting
---
"everyone wears"? I don't see anyone in the game wearing them.
---
Honestly I wouldn't even be against that either. At least then I could switch to MnK myself without having to buy a $100 adapter and be labeled a cheater.

Handing out more renown for TTS users would be unfair for everyone else because they get more renown to spend stuff on. The credits part is even more unfair, especially to the whole console playerbase. We dont even have a TTS in the first place

If they did this, you and everyone else who asks for it would then complain that no one is filling into your matches matches. Because that's what'd happen, one side will be down to 2v5 by round 2.

I think being able to select a few maps not to play (strictly only in casual) is something that should be implemented though. I quit every single time I get Favela or Kanal anyway.

Dude youre special, lesions shotgun is NUTS if youre good at the game
---
At least I got METAL GEAR Lesion
---
Later... or even tomorrow, i have  a lot of exams this week
---
I just realized that is Kabal's mask.
---
Also, no one seems to realize the look is of a generic vandal street wear from watch doggos
---
He was a VC. He was notorious and celebrated among the southern communists for his methods of sabotage and subterfuge, which were unconventional even by VC standards. He used his adrogynous facial features and wide pelvic structure to disguise himself as a prostitute, where he succeeded in spreading a particularly aggressive form of Chlamydia through the senior echelons of US and ARVN ground forces. Ironically, he was killed when he contracted syphilis from a USAF Lieutenant Colonel.

I won't be doing a dirty ~~QA~~ job!

^(Neither in my job I do QA job, use quality tools like code coverage, Test Driven Development.)
---
I honestly want to try using a pair of earphones/plugs. Headsets usually feel way too ‚Äúconstricting‚Äù for me... I guess? Halfway through a game you‚Äôll find me pulling one half of the headset off my ears due to discomfort which is a bad habit
---
kobe
---
Yeah bruh both his primarys are amazing and he's the best anti roam
---
Hopefully never
---
lol
---
_thought I looked cute, might delte later idk._
---
He's ok. I like playing him because I think he's fun. But he's definitely not necessary and there are definitely better ops to choose from.
---
this is actually cute lol
---
Why did this make me laugh
---
wow so deep,i have a tear in my eye as i clap for you.
---
Yeah I've gotta say I definitely prefer what we got over the Plague Doctor skin that's been suggested so many times.
---
Good work dude! but why am i so triggered that finka/lion and alibi/maestro are the only sets not horizontal from each other

---
YOU WERE THE CLOCK THAT WAS TICKIN IN MY HEART
---
It isn't. Smoke's elite is some thuggy looking antifa guy. Probably the worst elite so far. It was leaked.
---
It reeks (Ramsay deserved everything he got) of fake. I took a look at the operator icons and their strokes and with the exception of the icons where there are elements too small to successfully use a stroke (see Fuze or Sledge), majority, if not all, of the horizontal and vertical strokes are 18-20px. They're 20px according to some fan-powered website that hosts handmade art files (.AI/.EPS), so it's not "officially" 20px. 18px is .25in, which is a pretty standard value to use, so it wouldn't surprise me if Ubisoft was using 18px as their standard stroke weight. The left-most vertical stroke for this operator is way too thin, even at the resolution of this photo. It just doesn't stay in-line with the previous icons.
---
The pick-axe also has some uncharacteristic shading. Ubi isn't known for going all out for shading, and they've taken a very minimalist approach to the style they use for the icons. Deviating from an already established/approved style isn't uncommon but it's just easier for everyone involved if you establish a style the brand team likes.

You probably got the seals bundle :) seasonal universal became a thing in skull rain

"The lorem ipsum text is usually a section of a Latin text by Cicero with words altered, added and removed to make it nonsensical." I know what this text is, I used this constantly when I was still in school. So why you trying to pretend you know latin?

Thanos is the final boss in Siege
---
Pro league level plays
---
Only on console
---
Because it‚Äôs unfair if you won from someone cheating
---
What‚Äôs wrong with giving who plays TTS renown ? Every one on pc can play it , and if you are talking about console , they don‚Äôt even have TTS and it‚Äôs not a cross platform game so why not give pc players more renown when they can , and it won‚Äôt do any harm to console players , the credit part is understandable since they‚Äôre only bought with real money but the renown part is just being pissed off and not wanting good for pc players .
---
Dude who cares just don't pick an op.
---
Such a dumb feature to implement if its already existing.
---
honestly the elite looks better than this imo, this looks super generic and it should just be a legendary gear set like the pink ass smoke set. this doesn‚Äôt bring anything new to the table in terms of cosmetics and the new elite fits with his character more
---
Honestly it's why I quit the game, from 4 stack teams kicking the 5th because they're too lazy to find a 5th or are just cunts, to people rushing spawns and then spamming "EZ EZ EZ EZ SHIT PLAYERS EZ EZ EZ" in chat afterwards and the overall playerbase just being extremely toxic I just cba, got Diamond twice in my playtime on console and I literally just play because my friend finds the game fun, I don't even find it fun anymore because of the toxicity
---
I always thought she was inuit, because of her being Canadian and being named frost and all. Also in her elite skin she doesnt look very asian, even though her name is asian. Maybe shes half asian, half white. That would also explain her very western name (Tina).
---
NGL that's pretty hott /respect
---
For me, yes. His weapons are very well balanced, the AR is especially easy and fun to use, and his ability can be really useful whether you're going solo or with a team.
---
So the reply is basically what I'm saying since beginning?
---
Half the ops are underpicked (some around 5%, some around 10% when all ops SHOULD be around 20) and half the guns are useless. 
---
There could be good guns like the LMG on Zofia/IQ/Cap, but if they are used 1 tenth of the time they are useless. So yeah, LMG/DMR/Shotguns are never picked if there are smg/AR as alternatives, making them effectively useless.
---
Also, the deal with pistols is that when you have secondary SMG your loadout is already set. You could delete the pistols from smoke/echo etc and no one would care.
---
I love new players they are so innocent
---
Yah that‚Äôs what I thought. The pickaxe is a little TOO detailed
---
So cool
---
..Yes it does?
---
Kobe for sure, 
---
Ever nailed a four man with one nade?
---
I would pay money for a black ice nitro cell
---
I love jackal as long as someone else on my team is on twitch or thatcher. Also if I know there are multi floor roamers on large maps I‚Äôll use him. His guns are great imo
---
Get him bois he has fortnite charms in the corner
---
3fps that's hard bro
---
He‚Äôs the best!
---
It's just an ice cube
---
Does this count as  hackusation? I mean, he might have a great gaming chair, true that.
---
clutch city
---
I played castle when the game first came out. Stopped for a long time, weekend just home I started picking him as I was losing with my normal operators and what started asa meme pick as resulted in me picking him a lot now. I‚Äôm a better player than I was 3 years ago, so the shooting and the castle placements are better.
---
12 and a half actually
---
Unless your up against a cav or a vigil. Then its your best bet!
---
Omg yes, or like a cloak ability
---
As in, per 10k EARNED on the TTS you would get the credits
---
That's a good point, but I would like them to at least make it so that you join towards the end of the round or during the operator selection screen. to join just when the game has started only to have to wait 5 minutes for the round to conclude is just dumb.
---
I plead guilty
---
I agree that he doesn‚Äôt sound like it in game, but his bio describes him differently.
---

If you rush someone on 20hp, if they're any good, you will be punished. Idk how many bullshit clutches I've pulled because half the team rushed me. Regardless of HP, you can *always* clutch.
---
I don't give one shite about the plague doctor thing, but I know I outright hate this. It's like some edgy anime character.
---
June birthday here, I know how you feel N√∏kk üòî
---
You probably wont get that much for it probably around maybe 150 - 200 euro max
---
I also think a plague doctor skin would be cool. I‚Äôm pretty sure we have a steampunk plague doctor mask for him, but no complete outfit. It would be a very good Halloween skin.
---
I like it too, I mean everything's better than ANOTHER WW1/WW2 outfit.
---
That‚Äôs fair.
---
damn imma start having to play smoke then. this is sick
---
Was referring to the other guy but ok
---
Probably thought Lion was balanced too
---
It‚Äôs already hard enough getting teammates when someone leaves, don‚Äôt try to make it harder.
---
Also to note that i bought my xbox for 180 euro and i got 2 remotes and like 6 games
---
I personally think the reason I like his elite so much is mainly due to the fact that it doesn‚Äôt have fucking cargo shorts. I‚Äôd be happy with anything other than the fucking cargo shorts.
---
I really wish they'd make some skins that look like charcters from other games. Give smoke this. Make a thatcher or blackbeard skin that looks like Joseph seed. Pulse skin that looks like Vas. Cav skin made to look like an assassin.
---
Yeah but here's the thing, have you ever even tried using her shotgun with an extended barrel. She's perfectly fine where she is and honestly the skorpion is fine. Use the flash hider on it and set it to burst fire. No recoil.
---
Seasonal event is likely I think.
---
Thank you Frankie, very cool!
---
I have 250K renown on TTS, I doubt earn it but I have it
---
I think banning the new ops in ranked is fair game. Especially if people on your team don't know what they do or how to counter them yet.
---
this is almost as good as furry smoke
---
Invisible valk cams... That can move... And plant deny... Lol
---
Already Warden mains after one day? Lol
---
Droning is for nerds /s
---
I don‚Äôt think I know a single anime character that looks like him, and I watch a lot of anime. He might look a bit edgy I guess? But he‚Äôs dressing like a young rebellious British kid. Which is what his bio describes him as.
---
Ok ya that is what I was thinking to thanks
---
Oh look. Another sad no life who‚Äôs never going to amount to anything.
---
üòÇ
---
He already has the sick plague mask (called Hound right??)
---
Can you not team kill anymore?
---
Yep it count  and maybe
---
please remove hereford and fortress from ranked :(
---
Also skyscrapper...
---
Lmao smoke looks like a yellow vest protester
---
We're not arguing the technicality of how a gas mask works but what the mask works as. We could also argue odor is a characteristic of the gas that is the air. It's not a solid or a liquid hitting your nose. Not that a solid or liquid doesn't have odor either. The concept is fresh clean air in my nostrils and mouth. The plague doctor's masks was an attempt at that. So is piss on a sock, which I would argue should be Smoke's real elite skin.
---
So to be a cunt
---
I love lamp...
---
The new system was made because of assholes like you
---
A Nokk is a type of water spirit
---
I break 200 on a i5-600k, @4.3 w/ a 1080
---
The Rainbow Magic thing made me think this.
---
C4 with acog and black ice would be awesome
---
Better every loop
---
Looks pretty much like Fuze's icon..
---
One that scorpion thing is wrong,  it still has random horizontal recoil. Two look at my name,  that isn't ironic it's true. I know that the shotgun is good,  but Ela can't fight at range,  every otjer defender can which makes her outgunned. Her secondary gadgets are useless to her as they don't fit her roamer playstyle. Her mines really aren't that effective. They arent lethal, are a very short effect 5 seconds most of the time. Are easy to detect, and unlike most defender gadgets don't have markers above them. Which for a roamer is very bad.
---
That 30 year old, yoga pant wearin', daddy issue havin', hottie is a smoke!
---
Yeah it is not a punishment just a roll ack them just taking away ELO you shouldnt have had i personaly like this system and have no problem with having my elo being rolled back
---
Yo same lol my mind is blown
---
Don't you know? Being female and having some vague semblance of an ass = thick, if wearing tight clothing.
---
Am I the only one who thinks that a plague mask is much better suited for doc? Why would smoke have a plague mask?
---
And then there's Ash... There's always an Ash...
---
That's what an elite is for. Albeit they do have more and more remodels of the heads as of late (like Blackbeard boonie hat).
---
I always thought it was just mustard gas
---
Great job! You forgot to add recruit tough
---
For teh lulz xdxdxdxd
---
Oh
---
Wait that's illegal
---
it does that already if you dont pick any operator when match starts
---
He knew he was pushing so he peeked. Doesn't seem wrong. The 5v1 choke is wrong
---
It is. It even has an MVP animation with the canister.
---
Yeah, you could be right. But Barrage refered to Maestros gadget (a barrage of Lasers). Irbis could refer to his climbing abilties of course, still a bit odd choosing this name (it being russian and refering to an animal which can be found in south india)
---
Just not the uwu skin from the April even
---
Tis
---
Alright SCP-049 you can come and fight but no resurrections please
---
How do you get the operator main thing
---
boo
---
At least I had a daughter
---
They normalized operator hit boxes so it would only be a visual cue not a bigger hit box.
---
I hate walls
---
Did someone say pestilence???
---
Something like Apex did with Bloodhound would be cool, but I also like the Smoke Elite we will get.
---
At least my daughters didn't betray me
---
My apologies...
---
It does fit Nomad though, her icon has shaded sections but otherwise just thin lines - I always found her icon stands out of the pack for that reason.
---
I‚Äôm still not convinced, but it‚Äôs a dope icon and I‚Äôd be interested in hearing what the concept for the op would be.
---
Yeah sure but smokes elite is just so plain. Like the early elite skins like doc and sludge had such detail, it was amazing. So many tiny patches, cuts and tears. This is just some dude in a sweater. There's so little depth to it.
---
Also smonk is lurkmaster elite so a dark creepy skin seems fitting to me.
---
thanks for noticing me üòª‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Yeah... you get used to it in time
---
That‚Äôs what you get for using the pistol on sledge and not the smg-11
---
Kazoo kid: "wait a minute!"
---
I bet you never read his bio
---
CHANGED MY STATE OF MIND, BUT LOVE'S SO HARD TO FIND
---
At least I didn‚Äôt give the time stone to me
---
Bruh it‚Äôs an airsoft gun lol
---
same time as everyone else
---
As person that leans towards buck a lot, I‚Äôd say buck+Cav. I play a lot of different ops but Cav and buck are two of my favorites, as I used to main both of them. Both of them are extremely fun and although Cav requires some skill and quick thinking, they‚Äôre both god ops. Nomad is someone best saved for later.
---
FYI, PUBG Mobile has a plague skin. You just have to spend around 200 USD to get it. üòÇ
---
I mean last time we had a whole ass wall we could rappel through on Outbacl, so I feel like more can't hurt lmao
---
When the new season releases you‚Äôll get the ops
---
It's a timelapse of some siege gameplay
---
 + Random loadout option
---
At least I didn't get outplayed by a middle aged man
---
For the love of god Ubisoft don‚Äôt release this skin! I was expecting something more badass,but instead he looks like something straight from fortniteü§Æü§Æ
---
Fuckin hell that's sick
---
I like it. It‚Äôs cool how their mixing up the combos of weapons. Now I can use the SMG 12 and MPX at the same time
---
It isn't plain. It looks so good. A dark and creepy skin doesn't fit him. Read his biography and you'll know why this elite is perfect for  him.
---
But I‚Äôm old so a middle aged man could beat me
---
Where did you find all these
---
&gt; My keyboard will also just stop working completely and end up just holding in the S key. 
---
i have yet to play a match where my keyboard didnt lock up atleast once and when i ask people about, most of the time atleast one other person in the match has had this issue atleast once.
---
That is perfectly fine, as the more popular juggernauts are that way due to their balance. People prefer maps that are the most fair, and weeding out less fair maps like Villa and Fortress is perfectly fine. Whether or not they‚Äôre too unbalanced or not, if people don‚Äôt play it it‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt like it; so why are they forced to do something they don‚Äôt like? And I‚Äôm glad we can agree throwing Favela and yacht back into the queue with no changes was a bad idea. It‚Äôs just a waste of time, everyone leaves.
---
At least I'm not old
---
i aint gay, but that is hot
---
Nice but I wish you could give more details to each interaction instead of using barely any words
---
Yes you are
---
What's the point in asking to make it "as cool as" them? First of all, your definition of cool is obviously different from everyone else's so some people would see those guys and think they have a terrible design. Secondly, if you mean you want Smokes elite to look the same as them, it just wouldn't make sense. All the elites are either based off a characters bio or their country of origin and at no point does smokes bio reveal him to be a chav criminal and at no point has the SAS provided a chav criminal uniform.
---
With the elite we‚Äôre getting, I really, really don‚Äôt like that we can see his eyes
---
This gave me anxiety.
---
My favorite maps are that way due to balance; I prefer maps like Club house and Border over Villa and Bank
---
At least I did something in endgame not just hold up some water
---
Coppers
---
I‚Äôm supposed to get them 7 days early tho
---
I GOT THE HORSES IN THE BACK
---
At least I didn't dust away in endgame
---
Yes I am innocent
---

I feel you :')
---
I just want a tactical plumber skin for Maestro
---
its probably now that warden is uneffected by blitz so his skill floor is raised ^(if only by a inch)
---
Yes we do  
---
We'd rather see an operator being underpowered than gamebreaking
---
Looks weird, so much potential wasted.
---
But you did in infinity war we both dusted once so we even, balanced as all things should be
---
What's your sensitivity at?
---
Exactly, I feel like a plague doctor skin is really overused and tacky. This fits the character much better.
---
The only thing I don‚Äôt like the hair, I wish it was a crew cut or shaved because it‚Äôs looks cleaner with the outfit
---
I mean he could just really not like Ash to right? Like
---
Not from Coreross, you mean the leaks he saw that someone posted on this subreddit like 12hrs ago.
---
That is his elite skin you half frozen slice of bread.
---
Also valk's elite is a photographer and IQ's is an athlete so we're not doing realistic elites anymore anyway.
---
U get them when the new season comes out and ppl who don‚Äôt have the pass wait a week later to get them
---
Touch√© can't argue with that
---
You must be fun at parties
---
It'd be cool for a Halloween thing, but not as a big hyped up elite skin
---
Yeah it‚Äôs so stupid. I have another pc setup and it hasn‚Äôt done it once and I‚Äôve been playing on that one since parabellum when I switched from console to pc. Is it maybe just this patch where they removed the shield claymore and clash? In typical ubi fashion when they fix one thing they break another two things lol
---
Ok good talk, let‚Äôs just make up and play r6
---
Ohh okay I‚Äôm new to siege this year so I wasn‚Äôt sure how it worked thanks a lot dude!
---
üëÄokay
---
Yo this is awesome Latin operators
---
*cries in console*
---
I wish I could rn but I'm too being saving the universe and stuff
---
This entire collection board looks to have a lot of cool stuff! Do you have a picture gallery of more of your gamer/knickknack collection?
---
I'm tempted to get caviera
---
Underrated AF
---
I‚Äôm to busy at my last day of school
---
no you get them when it releases, everyone one else has to wait 7 days after that date
---
Yeah the Plague Doctor skin is really forced and doesn‚Äôt even remotely fit the character
---
I like Jackal, but I like how Buck can flip to his underbarrel much faster than swapping to a secondary. Leaves a lot less downtime, IMO. And you can have a pistol as a last resort in a pinch, too.
---
Jackal is a lot of fun with a good teammate to work with though - I expect N√∏kk to be a terrifying helper for Jackal.
---
I like how even the home opp shop menu is reversed as well lol
---
Alright here's why this Elite is definitively bad. What was the Pyro from TF2 famous for? Fear. The unknown makes us afraid and intrigued. Valve went along with this, and made the entire cast of characters terrified of his ruthless behavior. Then they went as far as to make a joke alternative view point skin where it's from the Pyro's perspective and he's clearly schizophrenic seeing a make believe wonderland. But that's beside the point, Ubi witnessed all of us call out  in a parade of demand, and simply failed to supply. Was a witch doctor set so far off a WW1 Doc set? Really? Or did you think your Tactical FPS's lore was so important it needed to be upheld even in Elite skins. Where TF2 and DotA2 adds alternative lore and creativity, you just made your character into his prepubescent loser self who doesn't instill an iota of fear or respect. For shame, wasted my time and anticipation. Why don't you want my money guys? Do you not think the thousands of people who upvoted the Witch Doctor ideas MEANT they'd buy it? Fucking hell.
---
Yeah I have shelves of figurines and other trinkets
---
Jackal's shotgun is NOT a replacement for Buck's gadget.
---
I'll be the rootinest, tootinest, gun-shootinent I-talian this side of the eternal city.
---
So sayeth our lord üëèüèº
---
Use the LMG, it‚Äôs pretty good
---
He looks like a little kid
---
Honestly it should say 
---
"BLIN"
---
There is no way to cut back on it. No feasible solution or counter. It's a terrible bs thing that happens and we all just have to live with it.
---
I still have igcse's to do lucky you
---
I can see you really followed the ‚Äúadd interesting title‚Äù thing
---
Nope. Should be muzzle break for all of them
---
Ya
---
Care to explain?
---
That'd be the one reason I wouldn't want this in the game
---
Awesome! I love seeing people‚Äôs gamer collections, since I don‚Äôt really have a collection of my own
---
Hopefully this video influences your decision
---
Forntite bad ranboye good
---
Get behind me!
---
Did I see a helmet? Wow ubisoft is such a harley davidson fan
---
Alright, see ya in a bit
---
This man . . . he has real power
---
Just checked it. It sucks. Talk about feeling out of place in the game.
---
The concept one with the plauge doctor mask is discusting
---
Idk why. The plague doctor is over rated and has nothing to do with smoke or his bio.
---
This is a hypothetical one unfortunately
---
My highest is gold 4
---
Talk about a Hail Mary
---
I'd rather a plague doctor uniform/headgear be a Halloween Doc look.
---
Although it's hard to imagine what a good look for smoke would be. The SAS already have the "Tactical" look and another historic one would be kind of meh.
---
Some sort of plain clothes/rapid response might be too fresh for some in Ireland due to the amount of animosity toward British forces and their questionable tactics/actions in the past.
---
Yes, you can see all the datamined cosmetics on the dataminers twitter. @obutu3\_
---
*Is it too much to ask for both?*
---
honestly the animation is great for the skin, i just dont like the skin.
---
Wanna join the gang? Lmao
---
I see your point, but I'm stubborn and I don't like it. I guess I'm being a bit of a nationalist here, but still
---
That's true but still yellow is a pretty neutral color for a team, same reason as to why spectator modes don't show teams as red and blue in competitive settings unless the teams color is explicitly red
---
I wish ubi would actually add a colorblind mode(doubt they would at this point) some characters blend in too much on some maps when they don't seem to for everyone else
---
Eh nah. Speak for yourself.
---
One of the things from the TS is, I dont have all the things in my main account. in the TS i am like LVL 47 and some skins (specially the Outbreak ones) and in my main i am 171.
---
I just dont want to waste my time, and the idea of the renown, or the 500 r6, are pretty nice.
---
(but i kinda doubt about the r6, cause console players would be pretty mad, and me too tho)
---
Honestly I agree, I think the elite for smoke actually looks pretty cool and plan on buying it once it drops
---
Did the same for bandit
---
Good excuse to play video games or look at my phone?
---
Well, i guess then the answer is Ubisoft.
---
Why did blood randomly spray in front of him
---
I guess I was looking for something more... creepy lol.
---
Nah she is just an SCP
---
That is actually more terrifying than nokk and almost as terrifying as caveira
---
Ohhhhhh I want the outbreak one
---
OP do you have a link???
---
Watch some yo boy Roy YouTube videos, they helped me a lot
---
I wanted a ww1 British soldier with a classic gas mask since gas with was a huge factor in ww1. He would go great with the J√§ger and doc elite
---
Ah, the Traptor. Or by it‚Äôs scientific name, *Owfuckitus Mylegica.*
---
I don't play on the TTS because my playtime is limited, and there is no feeling of progression. I feel like I'm wasting my time, with what little time I have to play. When I'm playing, I'm trying to climb. This incentive would definitely inspire me to give it a go.
---
The only chance Marley has of getting a Black Ice.
---
Marv, 049!
---
Confused. Does the max FOV go up with the resolution? Do you experience any frame loss? I would be at 1920x1080@144Hz but max 90 FOV.
---
He's always had a maximum since his introduction. I think they reduced the cool down between mines and subtracted one from his total at some point but there's always been a limit.
---
Sorry the the shop I bought it from has dissappeared
---
with the mvp screen its clear he is basically a rioter
---
Ok mate but have you actually compared her to other ops? Aside dok and IQ all of the females are quite literally flat
---
Well for example, before yesterday I hadn‚Äôt played since the temporary removal of deployable shields and claymores and forgot to change all my load outs. So when the Lord of Light assigned me IQ but I had no secondary gadget, it woulda been nice to be able to equip breach charges.
---
Lets be more honest than this, based on the personality Smoke portrays THAT LEAK DOESNT MATCH HIM IN THE SLIGHTEST!
---
Let me get that for you.

Mozzie can relate.
---
You‚Äôre so original and creative, wow. This has never been done before on this sub. Revolutionary.
---
I can understand that. But upon further research they frequently train with the Frogman and SEALs units, so it really speaks volumes about the design choices - they aren‚Äôt totally out of left field.
---
No credit to the artist?
---
The last two days...

Side note:
---
Warden's vest has ' A POS' written on it.
---
Shorthand for, " A piece of shit"
---
You mean SCP-049
---
Love how the shop is first
---
Don‚Äôt use it on Valk. Unless your planning on roaming the suppressor is just a damage reduction attachment.
---
With the Deagle‚Äôs recoil and magazine size, you want to maximize them getting downed or finished quicker, not  more silent. Especially if the team is calling out your previous location, then them knowing where you‚Äôre possibly at with high-powered AR‚Äôs versus your MPX and suppressed Deagle. You don‚Äôt want that. Damage over stealth, faster TTK over silent kill.
---
I know why 
---
Them "drugs"
---
Yeah, that one.
---
I saw mozzie, thermite, caviera, and two recruits. Didn‚Äôt see you guys and I‚Äôm disappointed
---
SMG 16?!?!
---
Thank you sir, you made my day
---
He didn't fully cut open the wall. There were still a couple points where the reinforcement was connected to the bottom, so the whole thing stayed.
---
Unless compensator for c8 or scorpion
---
He's a high ceiling operator and it takes a certain type of player. You'll get there with practice. I've seen Pros who never play him take him in PL and fuck up when it counts most (eg stunning someone with 3 seconds left, rather than waiting for 0) more than once Ha.
---
yeah just a bit tho
---
What kinda name is ‚ÄúRedacted‚Äù
---
Hello fxlx,
---
This looks fucking horrible, hope they scrap it like they did with the original Thatcher elite.
---
Which scp would be most similar to her?
---
I mean to be fair, there are people who spend the entire round droning out every little corner of the map and wait till there's 10 seconds left to push into the building. It really ruins the whole "go warm up in casual" aspect when you're sitting around waiting for 3 minutes just for 10 seconds of shooting
---
No, they are optional and help fund the dlc, them and the season passes are their main revenue.
---
I agree, although the time it takes to return to full effect takes too long
---
It‚Äôs fine. You don‚Äôt pay for new dlc like almost every game these days so complaining about price of a cosmetic is petty.
---
I like the price of them and I feel the skin fits the price but of course I want it to be worth less cause you could have more money in your wallet but no I do not have a problem with the price of them
---
Yessssss
---
We had a big meet up around 3pm that day with everyone the was cosplaying operators by her booth
---
It means that you will be attacking three rounds in a row, then defending three rounds in a row.
---
Dude I looked at that picture for so long and only now am I realizing that is her knee and not some sort of weird piece of equipment or backpack.
---
This is not an amazing idea. I'd rather say this is a stupid idea just based on the fact the man suggests Ubi should give our free credits. I can see the Ubisoft management bursting in laughter over this.
---
/r/GamerPals or /r/r4r
---
True, it would be nice to see a new weapon. But it probably has to do with licensing and people moving to Ghost Recon.
---
Hey any jager mains need a heal
---
*sniff sniff* "Is that pestilence I smell?"
---
no u
---
If they did Plague Doctor during Halloween and made it like the Ash Elite you could get from Outbreak I'd 100% drop big cash for that. Although Plague Doctor is pretty overused across video games, it's one of my favorite looks and when that fan created Elite skin came out all those years ago I was hoping Ubi would run with it. I guess we'll see if something better comes along, not feeling this Elite at all.
---
They just alter them for both, like the other ops that share guns.
---
You sound fun.
---
Personally, I'm not a huge fan of it, but if smoke mains like it, that's all that matters. Not every skin has to be made for me.
---
i didn't i like the new one personally
---
Well when you get shot and melee‚Äôd through your shield every 20 seconds it‚Äôs pretty difficult id say
---
Doubt it. Kicking would have made this match 3v5
---
Fuckijn 3 fps in the main menu
---
It's my responsibility to get a job at ubisoft in design and make better elite skins? Whatever happened to criticism? People and companies should be held responsible and to a standard as paid content producers and as artists. If the creation is not good to someone, it can be said so. Do you think Ubisoft is a single deviantart user who is going to shut down their account because of questionable cosmetics?
---
he could have a more modern plague doctor type uniform that utilizes his biohazard suit. like adding some steampunk/victorian era coloring and accents to it while having his mask being a traditional plague doctor mask
---
That's interesting. I've never heard his name nor any legend like that before. Would you mind if we got some references to his stories?
---
I do believe they are back.
---
More posts are surfacing about it.
---
smg-16
---
Let me get that r6 invitational one. I buy it
---
1hp and a dream!
---
The elite skin is awful...
---
That sounds stupid and to much fancynes
---
Just forgetting the UnderArmour symbol on the hat lol
---
When do we get claymores back?
---
I thought it was known that it‚Äôs mustard gas
---
Just leave this here so I can find it later
---
Forgot the C4‚Äôs charm..
---
This is so perfect it almost looks like some staged promotional video for siege
---
I just wonder how many loot boxes you will need to buy to unlock him

Hello foxfirehehexd, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/brtd9s/hacker_in_game/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
They are not fixed, IQ and shield glitch are still in the game
---
at 500 credits every 10k renown i would do that daily, sign me in
---
Yeah it's random in the way Russian roulette is. You never know who dies. (But in Buck's case mostly the hostage)
---
Just noticed this too, two ranked games in a row and lost both because Iof these glitches. Why add them back without fixing a thing..?
---
i would have much prefered a plague doctor type elite instead of this london rioter one
---
It's not just an issue for the "elite few" that are able to abuse the flaws of the maps. I'll get back to that point in a second.
---
But first, YES, I would argue that it's worth reducing the variety for everyone (but we don't have to because there are simple solutions that make everyone happy) in order to benefit the minority of players who do experience the exploitation of the flawed characteristics of the poorly designed maps.
---
The argument I see all the time is that lower ranked players don't notice the flaws of bad maps like Hereford or Fortress. They simply push site and take fights in an unstructured and less strategic way, and therefore we shouldn't take away their right to play those maps because it'll reduce the variety of play they experience.
---
The thing is, if you're not taking advantage of the strengths and weaknesses of a map, being strategic and structured, etc. then the map really doesn't matter, does it. They are already limiting the variety of their experience by the nature of how they play the game. 
---
Now imagine we remove the 5 glaringly bad maps from the ranked pool. Those same players may continue to play their typical uncoordinated and non-strategic style, and that's fine for them, the fact that they just walk in as Ash on Consulate doesn't take away from the fact that they can no longer just walk in as Ash on Chalet. And beyond that, they might actually play Consulate enough to learn some higher level strategy on the good maps that will expose them to strategic variety that is beyond the level of variety that you get from just having a larger map pool.
---
Which brings me back to the point I made in the first paragraph.
---
14 maps is too much for any newer player to be expected to build proficiency at a fun and satisfying rate. Based on the amount of time I spend on r/SiegeAcademy, the most common weakness of new players is that they feel completely lost on basically all maps. Not just learning layouts, but callouts, objective locations, basic pushes, important anchor positions, not to mention destructible floor and wall locations.
---
There's no reason to artificially hold back every new player's ability to learn the maps by filling the map pool with maps that they will eventually become too skilled to play a fun and balanced game on.
---
And like I said earlier, there are simple solutions that make everyone happy, such as giving people the option to turn off all non pro league maps, but keeping everyone on the same queue, basically exactly how the game mode options worked before. People with only bomb turned on still played with people who had all 3 modes turned on, but only when those players got bomb. 
---
There's simply no excuse for the situation to be what it currently is.
---
"Ay hollup"
---
Bro humans are just as stupid no matter what platform they play on. You don‚Äôt exist on a higher level of knowledge than anyone else üòÇ
---
That's why I said different reasons. The Lesion one for the animation, and the Smoke one because... well yeah, I think it speaks for itself.
---
I would be very mad I probably would have broke my controller
---
Exact same thing with me, everyone is doing the glitches ranked is unplayable
---
Yes but for all of these you would need the prior knowledge of the blitz's location to perform any of those actions reliably
---
Same haha
---
I'm terrible with shields so he's a 3 for me. In the 10 or so minutes I've played blitz I always want to hold the "block" button to raise my shield, but that's actually ADS. I know it's *my* fault, not the games, but I still hate shields.
---
You know, just ela in the a very cold environment but she still has yoga pants, perfectly normal
---
I like Mira a lot, don‚Äôt know if she‚Äôs in deluxe or not but if you don‚Äôt have her she can be a huge asset. She‚Äôs a bit tricky to get the hang of, and sometime your teammates don‚Äôt know how to work with her (no, I don‚Äôt want you to reinforce next to my black mirror, thank you) but her gadget is good and her guns absolutely clap
---
I‚Äôm fine with smokes official elite.
---
Do you have a link to where I can get these?
---
r/SuddenlyGay
---
All of you are mad because I said it's a console thing. No it happens on PC too. In silver.
---
You don't need the photoshop at the because your cosplay looks amazing
---
Suppressor on Deagle, sure. But muzzle brake on Deagle, ehhhhh.
---
But by golly, what an ass
---
She isn‚Äôt even thicc she flat af compared to many many other ops
---
I agreed it‚Äôs so overused
---
This is Gucci
---
I assume because shooting him around his shield is significantly harder
---
Two best games ever. Amazing
---
Until this game I was 2 wins away from plat 2 as well, guess I'll wait till they do something again so I can play
---
I don‚Äôt know why you are explaining this to me it wasn‚Äôt my choice. I‚Äôm just trying to guess their reasoning.

Can't wait for the nurf

You‚Äôre right, which is why you should keep your ears open for any loud ass shield clanging his way towards objective

You said NEVER on pc plat and a guy straight up said he‚Äôs witness idiocy in high plat on pc so you‚Äôre wrong, and the way you went about saying it made you sound like an ass.

Honey I shrunk J√§ger.

Yeah, but still, there are plenty of other weapons that had been used by the Secret Service. The even used a Tommy Gun, which was replaced by the Uzi in the 1970s.
---
woooo, no more pixel peaking garage door.
---
I can‚Äôt wait for this event can‚Äôt come soon enough
---
WHO WANTS STIMS?
---
I was one game into plat 2 before these two losses :((
---
That's honestly petty. 
---
Luckily the operators are shit, so i'm guessing no one is going to pick them anyway.
---
r/unexpectedthanos
---
For perfect balance
---
I don't think they have time to feel awkwardness when in a high risk situation. It's not like they're guarding a defuser with their back against a wall XD.
---
I was amongst few that actually did like the old lighting
---
Snowshoe. I am also from Texas.
---
He‚Äôs like, ‚Äúwhat the heck were they thinking making smokes elite look like that...‚Äù
---
PS4 is easier, and a bit less toxic.
---
It‚Äôs astounding how many 13 year old white kids have the N pass on Xbox
---
Yeah my email didn‚Äôt show up either till after I searched for it manually lol. Caveira and vigils are my personal favorites,but bandits is pretty badass too
---
Well I didn't get upvoted to heaven. A lot of people don't think it is an issue.
---
its a joke, not a dick, dont take it so hard
---
They can, but its rare. At least with smoke and mutes it can.
---
Whoever did that is a godsend
---
have fun
---
Looks promising but tbh if he or she is gonna have a french dmr atleast make it have 15 rounds in it not 10.. I'd use it more on lion but my god the ammo in the mag is stupid
---
WHAT?!
---
Is there a reason all the SAS troops have gas masks? Like a in lore or IRL reason I mean
---
You wanted*
---
I got the cav one i wish i had the money to get all but 30 dollars for a chibi smaller than a funko pop is way too much
---
I'm pretty sure they all can headshot. I've gotten one with ela too
---
Hi, Ubisoft representative here, sorry to hear about your concerns, we at Ubisoft are working to our capacity to solve these issues, we appreciate your criticism and I will relay your issue with the game to the main dev team!
---
I cant stand how Warden runs with his guns..
---
I first got the game after seeing a friend play it I fell in love. To me this is the type of game I love and enjoy but my only problem is that like all games they have bugs and when it's a tatical realism game that has effects in it.. 
---
However I do suggest getting the game as their is a newcomer mode but since your a little late you don't get the basic ops to start out with...
---
I also met some good and funny people on this game while some toxic but that's life
---
Go to the three little dots up in the corner of this sub. And then click choose flair.
---
Yeah let me just pull out my cams when a blitz is pushing me while his team mate holds an angle
---
Trust me
---
If James Charles joined the armed forces.
---
I'd go for any earned reknown (as in you played an actual match), it goes to your regular play. Maybe a unique weapon skin each season for testing it out each season. Something that isnt going to affect their business model. Because the amount I spent on the game and the amount I play, this game already just keeps on giving. I dont feel like they have ripped me off for 1 cent. My purchase of this game pays in dividends.
---
...Ela has he same secondary gadgets as J√§ger.
---
         -So J√§ger can anchor but Ela can‚Äôt? 
---
...the RDS makes up for the RG15‚Äôs stats because it makes headshots easier, that‚Äôs my whole point.
---
...Grzmots help you in firefights if the enemy is affected by one. They also are great for intel. Sure Lesion can see where his mines are, but remembering where they are isn‚Äôt that hard. Especially when they‚Äôre so loud.
---
I think what‚Äôs happening is that you‚Äôre just salty a character that you liked who was ridiculously overpowered got nerfed to a balanced state.
---
I miss those days, simpler times when gunplay didn't matter as much.
---
didn't watch the Christmas Story, but I can imagine what they would laugh like.
---
&gt; That's honestly petty.
---
What? It's only logical. We can't use the new ops so these bans won't affect us. There's the oportunity cost of not banning other probably more useful ops but the trolling aspect of it balances that out.
---
Clash - rework her out of the game
---
I always wish I could get good with Mira, but I just don‚Äôt click with the weapon.
---
You should go to the r/R6STeams
---
They posted about it on the [patch notes:](https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/game-info/seasons/phantomsight/index.aspx) but you can see the specific section [here.](https://i.imgur.com/56lMcSk.png)
---
No idea honestly.. your best bet is to get into contact with Ubisoft...also are they on the TTS
---
Well that‚Äôs ironic. Listen to you.
---
Legit thought this was cg for a second there
---
Vigil was defusing while you were planting. That's what happened.
---
AmnI the only one who finds it wierd default frost is wearing a legit under armour beanie, like with the logo. It just seems wierd to think ubisoft and under armour would partner.
---
...on some ops. Ela doesn't I tried.
---
Yeah I already made a bug report on R6Fix.
---
I honestly appreciate Mira players because they can be one of the biggest team players most of the time.
---
Clash- make her more appealing and viable
---
I think her gun has its perks, but it's not always good.
---
Problem with framerate.
---
What kind of assumption is that?
---
üôèüèΩüôèüèΩüôèüèΩ
---
I‚Äôve never had a problem with it but there are better sights
---
Looks like I'm gonna have to share equal time between Smonk and my main man Mute now..
---
ela ur gonna fREEZE put some normal pants on gdi
---
Shhh don‚Äôt tell them my secrets, how will I succeed now?
---
Just because you work with data does not mean you know all the data that is used to make a graph. They have said themselves multiple times that the graph is not entirely accurate. They simply use it to give a general idea of how the operator is playing out with the community. He's not going to get a buff because that would have a large effect on him in pro league where he is already used a lot.
---
I would mention the inaccuracy of the hair (though I guess I just did) but this is honestly better, Frost in dreads just doesn‚Äôt look all that good
---
Shotguns don‚Äôt have a headshot multiplier
---
I started grinning even before you peeked, then you got shot and i lost it at all
---
Use what you like. Personally I like the acog but there's times where it puts you at a disadvantage
---
I actually got 4% off each one so I paid less than 19.99 for each one. How and why was yours $30??
---
Ya ever seen a frog kid?
---
Yeah honestly it was funny the first time it happened, but then people kept doing for some reason. The point of the test server is to test the new changes in the upcoming season. Operators are at the top of the list. But you can't play with them if they keep getting banned.
---
Ash, make her a 2/2 and remove her acog (from the gun that still has it) and her angled grips, just to make it a little bit more challenging to play and so players have to be a little more prepared and coordinate with their teams, and to turn off new players as well
---
Who says I'm getting stressed? I'm just saying you're kinda dumb if you think they look a like because they both dress like cowboys. Lol

Because big black scary birdman is cool

Fuck what others say, use what you want.  I get shit daily from a few friends because I don't like using an ACOG on most attackers.  If you like using the red dot and you're doing just fine with it, then use the red dot

And just so you can prove to me that these graphs are indeed accurate, tell me why lions winrate was worse than kaids when he was broken?
---
No elite is better than this elite. 
---
At least with no elite we had hope for something fun to come...
---
I'm probably to redo the weapons part of this. I always love feedback on the gadget, weapon, and icon- for me the origin story is easy part. Sidenote: Might start taking suggestions...
---
Slowdge
---
I agree with nerfing ash but that would drop her pick rate to 0
---
YESSSSS
---
Feel like 500 is too much for that amount, when the characters cost 25k or 500 credits
---
I could see maybe 100 every 10k, it would be a little bonus
---
It's an amazing game and if you do get I would recommend you convince your friends to get it as it it is 10x more fun with friends.
---
Ya...that's the best we can do and wait for a response
---
If I change it, I will regret it because I lose my exclusive Unicorn Flair
---
Is there an option to change it with the current flair you have?
---
Right I understand, but this is a test server. It is used to test all the changes that are going to come in the new season. Especially new operators. And you can't play with them and test them if people keep banning them.
---
I don‚Äôt think it would make her go to zero but it would help other ops pick rates go up
---
No offense but your own data suggest there is a sweet spot for the ump at armor 2 with rook and armor 3 where it climbs up the rankings. 
---
Bitching about the umps low rate of fire is pointless, without low rate of fire guns the spread of variety In this game becomes lower. Variety is good for a number of reasons.....
---
Simply buffing the ‚Äòrof‚Äô is a lazy solution. And as stated arguably wouldn‚Äôt needed it if the games core problem got addressed imo. Which is more heavies on attack
---
Would ya look at that. THAT is badass as fuck.
---
Thought it was supposed to say Ash, and imply that Ash mains are toxic...
---
It looks amazing :D
---
**I smell pestilence**
---
Man i hate all the cod slander because none of this happens in competitive cod.
---
It looks amazing, you have it looking really good, the only thing I will criticize you about is the rifle is the wrong kind of rifle, other than that it‚Äôs amazing
---
This is trash and you should feel bad for posting it
---
10/10 didn‚Äôt even see this show up
---
Some players could use that.....
---
Ouch
---
Like I get that these tricks are cool and all, but it‚Äôs kind of annoying to have one content creator constantly trying to exploit a game that I just want to work properly
---
Damn Xbox player
---
Thank you
---
So you kill people even before they have a chance to kill you? That's pretty gay
---
true but in this case this is one of the ways for buffing him, give him another claw and he would be OP, buff his shot gun but it's already too op, maybe change his armor and speed rating but he was designed as Anchor, so what's left, his SMG and pistol , so yeah
---
His guns also have ridiculous recoil
---
Asshole because what‚Äôs in the canister is farts. Boom question answered.
---
Reminds me of MW2 noob tubes across the map XD good kill though!
---
Can you tldr the difference between 049 and 049j? 
---
The 049 entry seems to indicate that 049 is much more personable and not as much of a hack?
---
I kinda wanted bandits elite looking line that. With the hoodie thing. That would have made a great DRUGSdealer.
---
It's a shitty generic tower defense style game. Its depressing considering the past Android Tom Clancy games
---
Also testing flair
---
Thats not what it means at all. Zed had a low skill floor because any idiot can clear wave at a safe distance, harrass without using resource and last hit with his passive. He has a high skill ceiling because his ability allow for alot more techinical play and out play. Skill floor is how good you have to be to play the champ, skill ceiling is how good you *can* be with the champ
---
Terrible idea. Most skins are close to the body cause it's hard to tell if something is just fabric or part of the actual body. Imagine Smoke peeking a corner and you shoot the giant nose thing thinking it's part of his head and now he domes you cause you just gave away your position.  Same goes with that baggy ass robe he is wearing and that giant hood that makes his head look twice as big.
---
That‚Äôs not SAS gray, SAS grey is a much more purple/pink gray and it makes an amazing blend with the very minimalistic SAS icons. This gray is a  grayish brown, it‚Äôs similar to the SAS but it‚Äôs too dark to be the gray in the image. Plus the pick is too obvious and detailed, Ubisoft likes their icons to be nice and minimalistic while also not outright telling you what a op does, it‚Äôs at least true for the DLC ops.
---
But he doesn‚Äôt need a buff

Yo what the

Herpes is why I don‚Äôt trust holes anymore.

you make my day,, thanks
---
Thanks! Will definitely check out those settings. Im not having trouble with frames but more in the target size in-game. Im trying to find a balance so im not dependent on ACOG and can see far targets easier without sacrificing peripherals.
---
Giving the deagle muzzle brake was basically reintroducing Kaids pistol from the wind bastion test server, except it doesn‚Äôt have acog, thx Ubisoft for making a secondary weapon the best semi auto when it shouldn‚Äôt be
---
with the ability to add a vert grip
---
well we are going to find our in the next few months, but i say he could use an acog on his gun
---
Go to the top of the R6 page, and press the three dots in the top right, then select *change user flair*
---
smg-11 is better than the pistol. Suppressor is disgusting tho
---
A lot of the time someone will melee a wall before reinforcing it to increase the sound that comes through. Because sound in siege travels the most direct route, you can hear what‚Äôs behind the reinforcement better. 
---
The vase and computer thing is either because they are making a certain spot available (I.e removing a computer so they can vault on the table). Or they‚Äôre just messing around. Another theory I‚Äôve heard is that some pros destroy glass and vases to create debris on the floor which gives a small audio queue when walked on.
---
Too be honest I didnt want this I wanted a British soldier during the Northern Irish Troubles.
---
Her having a DMR for long-ranges would run completely counter-point to having silent step, end of story.  Her entire kit is designed around being able to get in unseen and unheard. While she is a master sniper in her lore, pointing to that specifically is cherry-picking as they also brag about her incredible infiltration abilities.  
---
Honestly, I fucking love this design choice.  I'm kind of sick of every attacker having a bog standard AR w/ACOG and the idea of one that revels in getting up close and personal is fantastic. I wasn't too keen on the choice of guns they made, but the idea to give an attacker and SMG and a shotgun is a breath of air this game has been sorely needing.  Simply slapping another unneeded DMR onto her would've been a step back in the attempt to be progressive with their design choice.
---
And, lets be honest, the only DMR that actually sees any real use in this game is Dokk's M14. Otherwise, who uses a DMR?  Maverick has the .50 Beowulf, but his M4 is used more.  Nobody touches the HK417 because Rainbow bought the mags in California.  Dokkaebi has the M14, but her other gun is a meme gun so competitively she has the one option.  Buck has the CAMRS but most run the C8. Blackbeard used to mainly run the SR-25, but the majority of Blackbeards I've seen lately are using the SCAR.  
---
So its not even the fact that I don't think she'd benefit from having a long-range option, Ubisoft seems incapable of properly balancing DMRs in the first place.
---
To be fair she is very pretty
---
Looks pretty nice
---
In your opinion. In the opinion of the developers and players that want the whole game to be balanced it isn't. 
---
That's life, we won't agree.

If you buy siege on steam with Paypal and then request a refund you'll get money back within few hours, normal banks are usually few days. Just give them bullshit reason for refund ie. game doesn't start / i bought this by mistake and they'll accept it.
---
Either pass or buy renown boosters if you play a lot to and will farm it hard, if you do then it'll be cheaper than season pass.
---
Well I say clash could use an ACOG but she doesnt need it
---
Thanks I got it
---
The eyes my dude the eyes.
---
Yesssss
---
Im gonna buy it to puss you off &lt;3
---
Well ash is a man so this is more accurate
---
What her name is* what‚Äôs what I meant
---
Thx
---
Hello geoxan69,
---
Good insight
---
There's also the part that you and random drone number 4 start looking at eachother with that
---
"What?"
---
It was exclusive for while the event was still going on.
---
&gt; Some people want the plague doctor because it‚Äôs more tacticool and in line with the spec ops looks.
---
How the fuck is plague doctor remotely spec ops? Just cause a fit is all black doesn't mean it's spec ops. Everything he is wearing is way too big and baggy. None of the things he is wearing is tactical in the slightest. In all honesty R6 is barely tactical and the only difference between a game like this and Overwatch is R6 is slightly realistic.
---
Wait is that AIDS?
---
why not she could use one ?
---
Cav gives a LION scan (broken as fuck) that pings you no matter where you are so i don‚Äôt know
---
how and why?
---
Oh! For the sound cues through the reinforcement, that's exactly what I'm I'm talking about! I had no idea sound worked like that. Of course, in a game like Siege, it's so crucial to get all those pieces of information.
---
Lmao bruh you think you spending money is gonna upset me? Everyone could buy this except me and I'll be just fine not wasting my money lol. Buy it twice smart guy it's not that deep I just dont like it move on
---
lol you're right but I prefer the aug
---
The operator that has been meta in pro league since day one, finally gets an elite skin and it it HORRENDOUS
---
Kids these days SMH üò§üôÑüôÑüò§ü§îüíØ
---
He is the only operator with a mask and proper filtration system on his back since he is the only op that doesn't take damage when standing in the smoke. If he didn't have a filter in his model then it'd look weird.
---
Exactly. Or angled.
---
You have ears?
---
Use them
---
*clank CLANK clank CLANK clank CLANK*
---
The reusing of weapons and shields  are my only issues with the game. I wish you could just pick your gun and go instead of having to use an operator you hate just to use his gun. Obvious exceptions would be cav and glaz, but they should introduce a purist mode where you have a recruit,  pick your gear and go. Just like every other rainbow game. But I guess that is a whole thread in it's own.
---
This better not be why they had to recycle guns
---
I‚Äôm glad they did, no one likes dying to someone they can‚Äôt see
---
Wow eye candy
---
Search bar
---
Only one way to find out. YMMV, but it won‚Äôt hurt to go to ubi support and ask.
---
This guy needs to go to broadcasting school
---
Gotta remove clash
---
I know how to clear my cookies who the mcfuck is augen tho?
---
oEN/S
---
You can change the call name on the Alexa app
---
Just one question: why is at 3 fps
---
This has been as issue for ages. Nothing is at frustrating as trying to spot someone in clear view but that camera says ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù.
---
Would he not be in some sort of military uniform? 
---
The lore says he was great at science but he didn't go around gassing people as a civilian kid did he?
---
Then how come I don‚Äôt see her wearing a tactle neck? (For the uneducated, tactical turtle neck )
---
He's not a 1 difficulty. People over estimate his old power. You take him our but everyone wanted to cry about the speed and shield
---
Hell i remember them saying it takes up to a maximum of 96 hours to deploy a fix on console after PC. 
---
We then proceed to wait an additional 3 weeks for a game breaking exploit to be fixed back when Blitz could ADS with his shield up (like clash atm, this happened about a year ago) - we had to wait for the entire new season because they couldnt be bothered to fix this exploit ruining the game.
---
HERE'S VALKY!!
---
You deserved to die for not sledging that cav
---
How do you know she‚Äôs not? You can‚Äôt see her neck...
---
I reverse image searched it and [this](https://pp.userapi.com/c844722/v844722116/11e208/9xLMsLStUKc.jpg) was the least compressed version of it I could find. Kimichangas's signature isn't distorted to hell in this version.
---
&gt; OP: *uses laser sight on **Sledge** with shotgun*
---
&gt; Me: It's okay to use the laser sight on the shotgun
---
&gt; You: Thatcher shouldn't use the shotgun.
---
**????**
---
If I can't make the situation clearer to you, then I don't know how I can.
---
Looks like he‚Äôs sniffing a diaper
---
You are only listing the ones you like. That's not an argument. Many people like many different types of skins.
---
I know you we're lagging but I got to say you're pretty garbage
---
*I must cure them, they are sick, the pestilence spreads so quickly, my cure is so close.*
---
Preach brother, its really not as bad as people think
---
Do you happen to know the meaning of Guerrilla Warfare?
---
This convo ended 8hrs ago
---
Honestly I want to see what‚Äôs under that netting. Not because shes probably hot, but because I want to see what kind of helmet that she has
---
Their username is literally right there in the picture.
---
The C1 does in fact not have a holo.
---
Don't use it much but it's a strange decision nonetheless.
---
I see your selfie
---
MORTAL KOMBAT!
---
I haven't. But I know the pain of putting your back to what turned out to be a soft wall in 1v3 as monty
---
:')
---
He‚Äôs fine.
---
Same! Kinda wanna know if she‚Äôs hot too tho..
---
Is that a raider CS-35 I see?
---
"Unmanned drones"
---
Jesus christ.
---
What was that.
---
I believe the broadcast settings might still apply I‚Äôm not sure, because it‚Äôs not a party setting
---
I don‚Äôt buy non-elite units much but this one I will. I never realized i needed an Italian cowboy. Wish it was an American op but this is still amazing.
---
Blitz takes almost zero skill, when that happens it's a blessing to know that you didn't die to bullshit
---
SIGN HIM UP!
---
Yup!
---
The objective scanning issue is basically a feature at this point. It can be remedied by quickly changing from your drone to another drone, but it is pretty frustrating.
---
The peeking is actually a new issue Ubi intentional created! They changed where the camera is located on the models. They made this change to fix another issue, but created a worse one instead. They haven‚Äôt said anything about fixing it, so I don‚Äôt think they care.
---
Ok this is epic
---
No one uses the Lord's picture in vain
---
Wait
---
Rook is 1 on the TTS.
---
Oh god oh fuck, what have you done to my wallet?
---
Alright good. What about Doc?
---
Oh the possibilities
---
Ive seen this somewhere..
---
And shot all above his head
---
He is a level 0.5 difficulty boys. Ubisoft, get some glasses.
---
Link pls. My heart angle the What in Anticipation. I really hope it‚Äôs a western event, even though my wallet will hate me.
---
On pc? Because I play on Xbox and it isn‚Äôt back yet.
---
The fuck is wrong with you people
---
I‚Äôm assuming he climbs walls that you are not able to repel
---
