Not necessarily. For example, Mira would be able to place her mirrors on enemy reinforcements to see where they are. But of course defenders would have access to acogs and some attackers would lose their acogs
---
---
---
Completely agree with you most of my group is around silver 1 and we usually get matched against 5 mans of plats and it kind of starting to ruin the game for me
---
the road to S.I isnt available. explain that
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Vigil probably 
---
It's both, tbh. It's unimmersive, yes, but by virtue of that is also unfun, in a game that strive for immersion.
---
For the longest time I hated Dokkabitch because of how bitchy she seemed in her operator video, now I just hate her cause she's annoying to play against.
---
List a few please 
---
Yeah, it was nowhere near as disruptive as the current issue, but your other comment tried to say it wasn't a glitch or exploit at all and that's just not the case.
---
You can shoot the speaker on border soooooooo
---
It is only available on the weekends, The weekend is over.
---
Yea, that‚Äôs saying you manage to get past I‚Äôm guessing a blitz, lion, ect. And manage to get into the obj to use the Mira.

i didnt know you could play cav or tachanka in SI

Pulse has a device that lets him see your heartbeat through ten feet of steel, and Doc has a dart of mystical wizard juice that can repair bullet wounds when shot out of his magical space dart gun that has no apparent means of propulsion.

Never seen this one before. That‚Äôs horrible. Could probably call it one of the worst ‚Äúlegendary‚Äù items across any game.

True that works. You have any other suggestions?

Just celebrate the spring festival!

What does it mean?

It wasn‚Äôt irony but ok.

Where is rhe Breach of rule #9?

Current rank is copper 2 but i threw down to that from my usual silver 1, plats and diamonds only appear in casual for me and it really is irritating.

I think it's only a matter of time before you improve, you just need to watch other players and practice. I also think you'll improve if you play in ranked, sure you might tank a season but casual won't give you anything near the practice you need. (I spent a whole season between copper and bronze, now I'm at the gold 3-4 level). My own kd is lower than I'd like bc of how long it took me to get good at the game, it really does just take patience and deciding how much it means to you.
---
Not really. Either get a good angle
---
or toss a C4 out. 
---
The problem with your neckbeard argumentation is that there's always a degree of assumption in most cases of cheating. It's the reason why the asshats who get banned try to appeal, because systems like overdraft give them plausible deniability. It's suffice to say that it's **highly unlikely** that he landed this shot legitimately. In other words, autists like you need to stop defending people who are sketchy, by default.
---
IQ can see the shield through walls, just like she can see Pulse when he has his scanner out
---
The figures are low quality, but theres Ubisoft licensing info on the boxes. A partnership between Ubi and Xtreme Play (the manufacturer) was announced a number of months ago. Where are you getting your info? Has Ubi made a statement regarding these figures? Genuinely curious. 
---
I know that I don't hit these kinds of shots because I don't cheat. You're just another virtue-signalling teenage twat who cheats and tricks himself into thinking it's his skill that got the kill.
---
Do people have issues with casual? I've played since the beginning and have introduced people to siege which obviously starts in casual with 0 issues lol
---
Heartbeat scammers are a thing (even tho not as good as pulse‚Äôs) you can check on YouTube for people scanning other people through walls so it‚Äôs definitely possible.
---
Doc doesn‚Äôt shoot potions, but probably morphine. And the syringe is propelled by CO2.
---
I repeat: it‚Äôs not magic, his syringe is shot by a CO2 gun.
---
It‚Äôs 2019 how the fr I c k were you unaware of that?
---
Are you new to the game? Just wondering.  Byeeee
---
I think this is more realistic. In real life aiming down sights doesn‚Äôt bring your face 1 cm away from the sight. The butt stock would tard your shoulder off. This is more realistic 
---
I still don't think it was an exploit, but neither is spamming in all fairness. Even glitch is kind of a stretch where it was more of an oversight that was even used in professional play which isn't exactly a place you use exploits otherwise. Just like some players crouch / lean spam in professional play as well.
---
But I'll give you that I worded my initial comment poorly.
---
We wait to show up till the very last second ;)
---
just checked, its 640 credits, kinda scummy as they are selling 600 credits for 7.49 so you have to go up to the $15 tier :(
---
I mean, wouldn‚Äôt that just be an aesthetic change?
---
I know its a fair point but why cant they find 2 others to make it a fair fight?
---
Thanks for the reply.
---
Big no. Fat no. Obese no. Literally god-level no.

What I'm saying is that I can't purchase this in the same transaction as a different Steam product at the same time, though. 
---
A very mild issue, was just seeing if there was a different way to purchase through Steam where it goes in a cart with other purchases at the same time.
---
Well as I can see your role as defender is controlling the position Lesion will be your best dude in this
---
And as a thatcher player i think you like being the support player holding angle more that going in gun blazing so Lion suited you right.
---
No cuz he‚Äôd be able to pistol people down while knowing their location. 
---
Easily stepping into OP territory there
---
Banned for? 
---
I shit you not I literally had this happend to me the other day tho me putting up the shield
---
Did you know steve jobs died of PC
---
Awesome! Thanks! 
---
Yeah I know. I just refuse to even touch the game until it's resolved. The last few games I played with my friends were infuriating because there's always someone that does it.
---
Birdbox challenge?
---
I uninstalled siege after 2,200 hours. The crouch and lean spam is too much for my weary bones. Besides, anthem comes out PDQ and the combat is... *lipsmack lipsmack* juicy.
---
Illuminate: confirmed
---
The hipfire is insane up close. Tap fire for medium range and just tap fire from the hip up close. Try it out on t hunt it's really good.
---
Operation outbreak special skin
---
Only change I‚Äôd enjoy is an increased fire rate 
---
Save your credits for cosmetics and unlock ops with whatever the yellow currency is. There's lots of cool cosmetics locked behind credits. 
---
Unless you don't care, in which case disregard. :)
---
Like they bought it then?
---
I expected a Skyrim meme half way through.
---
The last thing pulse needs is a buff to his gadget 
---
Toxicity, it also said I was banned for toxicity in a previous bandage for boosters but I got unbanned for that one.
---
Yea
---
So why only for operation outbreak 
---
 The pros only play like 4 maps anyway lul.
---
Because that's what it is and that's what uni decided it to be? I'm not god üòÇ
---
Lol. Thanks man. I‚Äôll see about it
---
Check the rules 
---
Oo thanks mate
---
Np! Glad I could help :) 
---
Well did you say anything in chat or voice chat because I haven‚Äôt heard of any false toxicity bans before
---
I bet you're hard to live with. Go away and rot melon head
---
Soulless.4
---
Hmm, the boosting one is easy to talk yourself out of. Do you know if its toxicity in voice chat or message chat? Is it a permaban or temporary? 
---
I know this isn‚Äôt really related to your post, but I hope they add more 1 speed attackers next year
---
Turn the image upside down
---
üòÇ
---
Solution. Stop losing 
---
If you're not diamond "because of crouchspamming and hackers" you're not diamond.
---
Well that's smart, or you could make him walk for the remaining of the round. 
---
Really wish stop saying the same shit over and over again
---
beautiful ending
---
With the shield positioned like it is in the video you would be able to see the side of his head through the window
---
 Here‚Äôs a example of what this picture is
---
Kid:cheats on test ‚Äúcopies off of his phone except for 2 answers‚Äù
---
Teacher:hmmm,seems legit ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt notice the difference‚Äù
---
Kid:illusion 100
---
that's up to you to decide. if you like the FK2 but feel like something could be improved, maybe trying the S2 could be good - as it is also ambidextrous, but slightly shorter and slightly taller.   
---
I moved from FK2 to S2 but your mileage may vary.
---
"you are being spotted" at a quick glance looks like "I want to die". Entire reason why I watched this because I did a double take.
---
The problem isn't just 3 speeds being fast, it's also 1 speeds being slow. Like, 70% right now is still very, very slow. They need to buff that first. Imagine the increase in fuze's pick rate when his speed goes up. Like, whydafaq is he even THAT SLOW? Is he literally carrying Russian bricks?!
---
I'm a support player and I have a pretty high rank https://r6tab.com/f0d57ee9-8d2d-4397-98c4-a8a638d3a47e

That‚Äôs understandable, I usually get silver just because I like the color of the charm üòÇ highest I think I‚Äôve been is Gold 1 during Blood Orchid, I probably could‚Äôve made Plat but I stopped playing because I didn‚Äôt know any better. I‚Äôve been playing since right before Operation Health
---
I‚Äôm happy with my fk2, thanks for the help!
---
ultra means 4k
---
My internet is often not my friend and I find myself getting kicked out of matches because the internet died. Usually I can't get back in until the game is just about to end or has ended entirely, still get bans and losses for it.
---
I'm pretty sure the system is working as intended tho. It's making sure people don't start matches, quit, then rejoin at the end for free wins. It also punishes quitters with the ban and renown debuff. I wish it were different due to the fact that a majority of the people I've seen talking about this are just players with bad luck (like your game crash and my internet thing), but at the same time if it were done differently I'm almost certain that some people would exploit it beyond repair for free wins and high ranks. 
---
Hey I find your placement of my kind offensive 
---
We are down in copper 4
---
RNGesus frowns upon you it seems
---
This shit's a problem, but shields weren't. Shields required effort and a little know-how, crouching really fast is just free kills for clicking a button a bunch. 
---
Keyboard and mouse lol
---
Lol
---
Just get better teammates 4head
---

Why would a greek have a latin name?

Why are you trying to open entire floors as someone OTHER than Buck or Sledge (the people designed to do it)?

You were playing blitz and used two of your flashes. you deserved it
---
Yes indeed you do
---
Possibly
---
3 out of the 5 possible free packs you can get, I‚Äôve gotten Pulse, Thatcher and Mira‚Äôs charms. They‚Äôre cool, but you can‚Äôt try say your luck is worse than mine.

All I wanted was some love, Ubi. Some love. &lt;/3

are you on psn ?

Hey man, I just looked up popular Greek names lol

Is this a bad time to mention he had a pint of 9000 as well?
---
Yoinks
---
Probably invitationals weekend.
---
*sad mortem*
---
Got any games on yo-
---
Yes which, unfortunately, prevents him from being added to the game due to the fact that we already have a character named Nomad
---
Bro it just does not make sense in the game lore. 
---
The grind for ops isn‚Äôt fun, if you want the complete edition go ahead. :)
---
Aye I invited you and sent you a message
---
&gt;Hell yea brother.
---
But when is that
---
I‚Äôm in plat 2 and still get shitters on my team, it‚Äôs frustrating
---
Thanks for the post man, good stuff.
---
Idk were the lag spikes came from in the clip i didnt have them in the game
---
Reee
---
Yeah i took a break and recently came back and I‚Äôve been having sooo much fun. 
---
Your just being stupid 
---
Showing bugs/glitches is fine, but showing how they're done can lead to popularising it more.
---
I'm just saying the consoles each have good parts  about them and the console is by no means bad but PS4 controller is garbage
---
Lol, like he's some kind of R6 authority? Nah. 
---
Buddy you didn't even make this
---
Nigerundayoooooo
---
Nope its illegal
---
And here I am wishing my bf would do that for me lol
---
The meta is maverick, ash crouch spamming, blitz and on defense: maestro, lesion, and doc or rook
---
Well ill be, a woman who plays siege. Too few and far in between unfortunately
---
You can still think someones trash for doing it, because they are. It's a cheap way to outgun someone, with 0 skill involved. I have never done it, because I'm not shit. But u fault those who do it, for being so bad they have to exploit the absolute cheapest way to get kills. A lot of people choose not to do it, so to those who do, go fuck yourselves. 
---
By the time I run all the way around the shelf to shoot he'd already be facing me. It's almost impossible to kill a monty in such tight quarters without directly going for the knife.
---
really? I feel like xbox‚Äôs sticks are goofy 
---
Why must Recruit be intentionally bad though? Just because he is intentionally bad currently does not mean that he ought to be intentionally bad. These buffs would make Recruit more playable, but a real operator would still be a slightly better choice as they get an actual gadget. The only reason I've seen brought up is that recruit is free, but that does not hold much water IMO - you should not be forced to have a major disadvantage just because you are new or haven't unlocked much yet. That sentiment seems to be reflected by the devs as well, given that all standard edition players get all the base ops for free, starter edition players get more ops than they used to, and all attachments are free.
---
Gold one and gold 4 on both accounts 
---
You don't understand my point. Never said that, simply meant that his art is very popular and he's a very popular community member that is always active, so his viewpoint of the game that is anything from his personal annoyances, problems, etc. can have a big impact on the game because the Devs love his work and see what I believe 90% or if not all of his work.

I'm not hating on the layout but it's so bulky. Not trying to say I'm better you do you

Just better graphics 
---
Lmao, good meme but the mods are gonna take it down
---
Just standard, most cost effective with very little limiting factors 
---
That's not what you worded it to mean at all, but I get what you mean once you explained it. 
---
What comes with the standard?
---
Well over 1K people understood what I meant so
---
How did they make the bandit logo and the R6 logo thing on the top? I wonder what it's made of. 
---
It‚Äôs not supported on r6s, you need an adapter
---
So..? Continue. 
---
Lean spam the f*** out of them and move back and forth . Idk why people dont realize this?
---
Nothing to continue I explained myself and the conversation is over.
---
Dok is annoying, but not that bad imo unless you pair her with a blitz. Speaking of Blitz, yeah, they gotta work on him after Lion's finished. 
---
Literally the type of people who sit at 3301 and say fuck you kid im plat fite me 1v1
---
Do they? Latam players keep calling me monkey every hour or so.
---
It‚Äôs made of fondant. 
---
Probaly won't because of the Vegas shooting.
---
it looks kewl it's like a weapon your GI Joes would have had when you were growing up
---
I would love some of that cake :3
---
I feel if the double jump was in and the wall running there‚Äôd be non stop bitching and people abusing it so I‚Äôm actually ok with it gone lol
---
Yeah I got the standard when you had to buy the base and attachments 
---
You said you have no job ü§î
---
r/R6OperatorCreator I have an op with the same name on this ‚¨ÜÔ∏è sub.
---
I had it on console when that was a thing, but I built my pc at the right time, two days after I got everything settled the new season started and I got the complete edition. 
---
Waaaait!
---
When did I say that?
---
Then let Yokai do the rest! 
---
Sh*t happens a lot in ranked.
---
Add fps drops to that every 10 seconds, and you now have a ruined weekend.

Look for a bakery that makes custom cakes &amp; show them a photo of what you want. This was definitely not the cheapest cake but it wasn‚Äôt ridiculously expensive also. My boyfriend was very happy indeed! It was his very first customed cake. :)

Thank you! :)
---
That ones actually decent, with LEDs on the side
---
He was! :)
---
Let me guess, he‚Äôs a bandit main?

Thanks

If people could whack Monty and expose his entire body people would stop playing Monty.
---
She has enough counters that she's not really a problem...definitely not one to quit the game over. Not to say you guys can't stop playing for whatever reason. You guys do you. But personally? I think it's a stupid think to quit over.

You said something about being ‚Äúthe most jobless person in the south-east‚Äù before.
---
Why did I get given this for free?  
---
No u
---
Exactly!
---
Feel free to give me your thoughts! 
---
I absolutely love this game but I‚Äôm hardly touch it because I‚Äôm tired of joining these toxic servers where people start randomly kicking someone 10 seconds into the game. I just got on it rn for the first time in a bout a month and the first game, not even finished with the first sequence of the first round, and I‚Äôm kicked out within seconds for no reason. 
---
Lmao rather than make this comment u could‚Äôve looked up urself y it‚Äôs possible.
---
I really like her, I love all the simple skins.
---
Can post my opinion about what I THINK something is with out someone writing a paper explaining on how you are wrong.
---
Idk about others but there's a lot of assholes on ps4. Teamkilling and voting to kick for such petty and insignificant reasons. I've definitely been playing it less over the past few months. 
---
Just because many older players just want to be ‚Äúfunny‚Äù in there minds
---
And yes I know it's not actually Thursday...
---
Just pointing out, Clark isnt really Clark.
---
You mean the operators, end march

Thank you for replying, but I was talking about the lunar new year sale.

When I heard everyone yes, not when nothing was going on. If I held my push to talk key then my indicator appeared.

still way less than 3.5 minutes, I thnk there was a mistake
---
Depends on the height, but you'll most likely die
---
Just realised, why is he all kitted out with fancy pockets and everything while the others aren't?
---
Unpopular opinion: remove ACOGs from defenders. Make them rely more on clever plays and gadgets.
---
Because he is "black" ? That's not even castles real name nor is he Navy seals 
---
i dont kniw about that
---
This clip is so underrated

This was a such good map.

I‚Äôm in the same boat compadre, I hit platt 1 every season on Xbox, maintain a 1.3 KD, and I would consider myself a well rounded player. However on PC that all gets throw out the window because console platts = PC coppers 
---
OH JESUS SHES RIGHT BEHIND YOU AAHHHHH
---
I know. I've had the game since launch and basically memorized every map at this point from repetition, but I took a big break and came back to find that they changed several maps in ways that seemed drastic

üòÇüòÇ you know all to well lol

\*Sweat drips from fingers onto the lean and crouch keys\*
---
Yes. That's how it works.
---
I want it

Thanks for attempting to help me nonetheless 
---
They launched the game with sci-fi in it. "Realistic" small harmless EMP grenades, right. It's no less sci-fi than Maestro or Vigil devices - technology  is almost there, but not quite yet.
---
they forgot to take the wrapping off of the sight!
---
replace all diamonds with ‚Äò‚Äôplays doc and ash ACOG and tbags every kill
---
Cmon man cant you see the ‚Äú02‚Äù was removed thats truly legendary worthy
---
I just imagined the scene from fnaf 1 when foxy escapes his pirate cove and charges down the hall, but instead its blitz ready to flash your eyes to oblivion
---
Is it like, earn x amount or is it in a time frame kind of thing?

Or just use the mic?

But can you imagine how strong she'll be in pro league? Her taking the pro's drones will result in her gettign heavily banned until she's nerfed, Even though we won't see Gridlock and Mozzie until summer which is Year 4: Season 2.

Clash has the lowest pick and win-rate of all ops

I‚Äôve seen commons that are better than this 
---
Yeah but some people don‚Äôt have a mic, or are anxious about speaking online. I see no reason not to add at least a quickchat feature since so many other games, especially competitive ones like CSGO and Overwatch have them.

Finally people that fit into the costume perfectly

Looks too young to be the director of Rainbow Six.

Just because it's got a different name doesn't mean it isn't sheilded from Siege's issues, ranked has been in beta for years, it's never going to not have this problem
---
See what I‚Äôve said to u/Pezzlington.

Social anxiety, age, not having a microphone. Also, some people can‚Äôt talk at all.

It‚Äôs crazy how he can go from an extra in one episode of Bones to a highly respected movie star.

This is obviously faked the enemies even if they‚Äôre in casual would‚Äôve noticed

Again, we need to take those leaks with a grain of salt. We can‚Äôt be 100% sure before we see the preview panel.

I haven‚Äôt gotten a legendary yet... :( I have played since three came out

though i've read ram speed doesn't affect performance very much unless it's like anciently slow

My friend started doing it 2 days ago. Ive been watching him. It's crazy!
---
Dress up as Ela or IQ
---
I think so too, but it could also be just low level games..
---
At least you can get an ace every round now
---
go into t hunt and practice you aim. drone effectively and NEVER get into a position where a teammates fuck up can kill you. the only way you're getting out is by 1v5 ing EVERY round. when I mean dont get into a position that relies on your teammates not fucking up I mean absolutely never. if the site you're attacking needs a hardbreacher you are playing hardbreach. also, fully expect your opponents to so stupid shit. at that rank you're playing glorified casual, just look for them and kill them. dont over think it

I know battle eye is a good anti cheat but holy fuck the amount of people getting banned was insane and it was all new players that probably just bought it on the steam sale. 
---
I'm fine with there being memes on the sub, but it annoys me that the rule is in place without the mods doing anything about it. They basically just pick and choose which ones they want to delete based on personal preference.
---
I've done some more digging to try and understand the way the directional audio works with walls and openings, and I can say with finality that this is single handedly the worst directional audio I've ever heard of in a game. Walls magically block 100% of sound unless you are arbitrarily close to an opening. Sound does not take "the path of least resistance" in real life, which is why I'm having such trouble with this game, the audio feels so unnatural I cannot correctly collect information from audio. I wish this game just used a system based on audio occlusion just like everything else.

You either push your twitch drone to get Mira windows, or you pull it out and save it, collect it and deploy it once you are inside the building.
---
Twitch drones are too important to risk losing them. 
---
I thing it would be good or at the least switch the gun to the aa12 when I using it 
---
100% this.
---
I hate the number of stupid colourful skins and outfits/headgears for this game. The vast majority of skins I wouldn‚Äôt ever want on this game.
---
I‚Äôm copper in the game but apparently I‚Äôm diamond according this chart...
---
Weapon skin will be available permanently right? 
---
Bloodhound best character because my vision is potato
---
I've gotten plasma pink and the m249 legendaries ;(
---
No, the one description for ranked players should be "Is a subhuman". Because that's how the community behaves.
---
aye aye cap'n
---
I‚Äôm trapped in silver since I can go from silver 4-2 but at silver one I get the biggest diamonds in a party as the enemy team 
---
It's Hereford base.... did you expect anything less? 
---
It's great. Feels like Blackout mixed with Borderlands mixed with Titanfall - taking all of the best parts of each. The gunplay is solid and the "feature set" is intuitive without being broken, which is more than you can say about 90% of battle royales for whatever reason.
---
You've just described like 80% of the high rank community on siege.
---
Why is a plat 3 in causal isn‚Äôt that just bullying at that point

If somebody was disarming the bomb, surely they would have shot them first? This ensured that they didnt think to look at the bomb.

Crouch spamming is the worst thing when ur playing on consoles.

It's like a McDonald's skin
---
Good eye. I originally just made a dab (that's why my signature is on upper half) but then I came across that one and figured I make a tribute of sorts (you can see that by how arms are posed differently in second part and general roughness) and somewhat changed the pose to better resemble original and make it more ~~funny~~ cringy :V
---
Can't kick in ranked.

Hello VorticalEnder, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ancfsf/bank_shelf_holes_op/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Idk about you but I see at least 1 in every match of casual I play.
---
Pretty much all the legendaries are pathetic. Ive just got the legendary rook armor, its basically his standard one with a brighter blue. Then there is the great example of the Politsiya legendary which is 1:1 the same (even the same name!) as the rare SASG skin 
---
(https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/72616q/why_is_the_politsiya_skin_legendary_for_the/). The good stuff goes into the loot boxes so they can make money. The somewhat good stuff goes into the credits only bundles. The rest goes into alpha packs and renown packs to con people out of their renown so they buy credits or season passes even for ops. 
---
Weird flex, but ok
---
I don‚Äôt look at everyone‚Äôs rank
---
Wow, so different
---
This skin is nice. I love olive green
---
Valentines day on a budget: shoe polish and an electric razor
---
Can macros just get bans already?
---
So, did you create this on your own,
---
Or did you read lore somewhere that Kaid loves cats?
---
Because I had spiders for his charms on his weapons since he used them as inspiration for his R'tila, but now I'm thinking of using the lucky cat charm
---
Because we are not talking about a game that is dominated by 8 year olds
---
its not a seasonal skin actually, I dont think it will be available for the rest of the season
---
All the toxicity problems... naaaaaaa this skin is bad ubi plz suck me off! 
---
Defuser - they probably were looking at the bombs too much...
---
He was talking as if a real gun in a game makes it a realistic shooter mate. 
---
I get the mindset here, she wanted to throw another gadget. It would've worked with Valkyrie, Lesion, or flashbangs.
---
They could still make one with her AA-12 in hands. They haven't even done that. The lack of such a feature is seriously deteriorating player experience with Alibi. You can't run weapon skins on it or use any headgear or uniform if you want to play strategically with her. And that's not good man.
---
wait its still operation windbastion right? what did you expect?
---
It is less realistic than Siege.
---
Damn that's a good Pulse! 
---
Is this a recent thing? I have over 1000h on PS4 until 1 year ago, and there was never an issue.
---
Now on PC I see some in this tread below say they have issues on PC too, some don't - think it may be an issue of hardware setups (incl headset vs speakers)
---
In this case bf 4 is more realistic
---
Why is the tag Useful xD

No shit sherlock, do you not see me being sarcastic?

grow the fuck up

/thread

Everything relevant has been said.
---
That sounds like a super good idea! Sometimes he has moving backgrounds too maybe I could try and animate something üòÑ
---
Why even bring it up then when we are talking about something unrelated, this person has alot of good points is their argument.
---
You mean 'Kids Room'?
---
Why would you repost literally an hour after it‚Äôs been posted. That‚Äôs next level karma jacking. 
---
I love it when people say that they got hooked on Siege, I usually hear, "fuck this shit, everybody's using hacks"
---
Because of the learning curve but it's actually fun to play once you get decent amount of knowledge and skills.
---
Is the grappling hook payed? Its my tf2 go to
---
Omg I‚Äôm not alone 
---
Not having a free version is also a way to make cheating expensive, if anti-cheat would work actually work.
---
With free to play you can create a new account and cheat again with no consequences.
---
Did I say that this is a console subreddit?
---
If he doesn't wife you soon after this leave him
---
You lost me at 'It just makes sense people'
---
If you're good enough at the game, nearly every pixel peek is counterable. Just like everything in the game. Crouch spam is unrealistic, lean spam is unrealistic, a fucking drone that checks an entire building for movements is unrealistic, a heartbeat sensor is unrealistic, jackal's gadget is unrealistic.
---
It's creative liberty. Bullets from the barrel would fuck up the way this game can be picked up so easily. Go play PUBG if you want a casual milsim.
---
well damn... I wonder if it is using the drone spawn call to spawn the operator instead 
---
I think Ela for sure ))
---
IQ is hot AF
---
Zofia FTW.
---
Thank you all for the responses! :)
---
BY THE TIME IT'S HIT YOU, YOUR LAST SURPRISE
---
The original contains the actual meaning of the gestures. This post here is an edit of that to make it a meme. Maybe you‚Äôre confused and think they‚Äôre both the same.
---
Only if you want to. He's going to have a rework soon so keep that in mind. I main him coz he's vector is a well balanced gun which feel good to shoot and the ability is a big support for the teamplay.
---
I most commonly use 1, 3, 5, 6, and 9
---
I can't count the amount of times I've shot someones feet under the barricade while they're trying to melee/place a breach charge. Even funnier when you kill another guy doing the exact same thing in 1 round.
---
Daaaamn!! Sell them and make a fortune... Well maybe not a fortune but some money
---
Yeah, the r4c is fucked up with how good it is, especially for a 3 speed
---
I think there should'nt be any problems, I dont know about the uplay and steam thing but the operators should usually get added to your current account.
---
Same with PlayStation. It‚Äôs becoming an issue. 
---
She looks like Tyler1 in this art 
---
There are probably like 5-6 decent-good legendary skins in the game. Every single elite weapon skin (except maybe IQ) is utter trash and not even worth equipping. 
---
Ive only had 2 worth anything, the one M249 ‚ÄúGGEZ‚Äù skin and the frost SMG ‚Äúbilliards‚Äù (i think) skin. 
---
Idk why the legendary weapon skins in Siege are so bad, its not hard to make something look sick af.
---
Is it universal?
---
Literally xd irl ‚öß
---
yes sir.
---
less disorienting than the fat fuck we got now imo
---
I at least do 5 of these in one game
---
I dont know what the thread is about.. just buy it? XD
---
Yup its cool
---
 good shot, wrong target XD
---
God bless you 
---
All that to kill one man üòÇ
---
I agree, even though I own over 40 universal skins I'll probably buy it anyways XD
---
When you‚Äôre bandit tricking but don‚Äôt get an audio cue for the charge been placed or the detonation..
---
if noone noticed, it wasn't an issue
---
Gg
---
that's pretty shitty
---
You called IQ elite skin "Absolutely atrocious. Garbage. Horrible.", doesn't seem like sensible criticism, especially since it's your subjective opinion.
---
All your "evidence" is some screenshots and youtube clips, nothing with any actual data on anything. It's SHITE man, there's nothing to conclude from there. there's no point to be made, there's no information, there's nothing of value. It's just random ass screenshots.
---
The fact you can't tell operators from each other if they have similiar colors on them is a YOU issue, it's not an issue to the competitive integrity of this game, it's not an issue at the highest level of play and it's not an issue the devs should pay any attention to.
---
Skins are not a detriment to gameplay, they've never been. The same old tired complaint has been around for years yet it's never been proven to be at all true. Skins are what made most games popular today what they are. Tell me LoL, Dota 2, CSGO or Fortnite would be where they are now without skins and cosmetics, and tell me any of them would be better without skins. You're shit out of luck with the point you are trying to argue, all the "evidence" you have is your subjective opinions and some screenshots comparing colors, NOTHING THERE IS VALID AS EVIDENCE. And if you can't see that i am baffled.
---
As a fellow Tachanka cosplayer - what company &amp; store did you get that Gorka from? I tore up my pants and VSO stopped selling the correct variation.
---
Don't you hate it when your aimbot locks to your team mate insted of your enemy. /s
---
Cav confirmed best anchor
---
it came during the SI content but sadly i bought it from steam
---
Also what about ADS sens? My current sens is 12/12/40 and it feels kinda slow, playing on 750 DPI also. I kinda prefer the higher sens like 20/20/70 lets say, I can flick well but I cant make small adjustments
---
This is so me when i shittalk my 15 yr old teammates for having no reaction time and always picking ash... like, if you pick ash then at least get one frag instead of dying in the first 10 secunds by the helipad spawnpeak.(smh)
---
I am playing this game since operation dustline and I have never seen an operator holding his gun with the left hand. I have no idead what happened there but I don't think its intentional.
---
Ubisoft fucked something up, I'm missing 2016 Christmas universal skin and I doubt I'll get it back.
---
No it doesn‚Äôt. Killing two people as long as they‚Äôre different people usually is fine with the system 
---
‚ÄúHere we see a group of Echo mains in their natural habitat behind a shield in bomb‚Äù
---
He‚Äôs ascending 
---
No, not organized. I'm just annoyed that it's weighted towards the edge, and not fully random. At 8+ meters, you are doing so little damage that most of your less-than-half-damage pellets miss outright, half of what remains deals piddly limb damage... The pellet count for all shotguns in the game is at least half of what a real world shell would hold (Bailiff's 4 to the Taurus Judge's 8, the M590's 8 to the real life M500's 18), making them woefully unreliable. 
---
Ubi plz fix.
---
He‚Äôs just hanging out
---
It happens when you lean left with two-handed weapons, possibly to avoid ‚Äúchicken-winging‚Äù.
---
but countless fuckin people did notice it dude, just cause SOMEONE blew it up doesnt mean it was never an issue...
---
Buy it off Ubisoft store. Major discount going on atm
---
Recently,there was a revelation that pulse,one of the operators in the game was/is romantically linked with another op, Hibana, maybe you could paint them as versions of yourselves, enjoying a nice day out in the countryside(preferably as the map Villa as a bg,it's got great vistas to stare down.
---
Do you play on US or European servers? I haven't run into this yet on ps4. 
---
Ela
---
#he hung himself
---
You can also do this with castle barricades. If Mav. puts some holes in it, you can pick it up and put it back up and it‚Äôll be new barricade 
---
Nah he means reinforcing the hatch leading from front room (with the pool table) down into gym on the 1up 1down bombsites. That shit is round losing
---
( ._.) ouch 
---
something that always helps me is imagining what I would do if I was them. where would I come in from, where would I rotate to, where would I be holding an angle from? you won't always guess correctly but in my opinion it's better than not guessing at all 
---
also you might already do this but always aim for upper chest/head area even when you don't see the person yet. if you know someone's about to come in the door aim your sight where their head should be when they come in. kind of goes along with imagining where the enemy is going to be

Oops

I got mine from vitiazspec, but the centers are more green than tan. Over time, some of the green has come out, so thats good
---
I read this in therussianbadger‚Äôs voice
---
sens is something that is different for everyone, everyone that played on my sens said that its way too low but I still manage to hit insane shots and get a lot of frags. Find a sens where you can do basic flicks like 180 shots or something just by memory.. sens isnt really important when you feel comfortable with it, you have to know the movement you have to make in order to kill someone that is to your right, left or behind you. Because sometimes you hear something behind you and you have to be very fast, thats why its very important to know the movements you need to make with the sens you are comfortable with.
---
You don't necessarly have to drone every room, that's just wasting time. I know it's "scary" to enter the building when you haven't found their roamers yet, but just like I said you have to know the map well enough to know where the roamers could be. let's say youre playing Chalet and the enemy is in Kitchen/Throphy there will probably be a roamer somewhere upstairs because the hatch above kitchen is a very important spot for attackers. 
---
What headset are you using, and would you say that you can rely on sound?
---
Or he made a post addressing the issue without knowing that Flanked made a video about?
---
I hate everything about you. 
---
It absolutely doesn't imply that
---
I'm having trouble visualizing this

*plat 3* btw

Ohho boi if only you knew my ultimate powers that push my team to infinity and beyond with good old Chanky-boi at my disposal.... 1.75+ for both k/d and W/L üòéüòéüòé
---
Night mode fucks with the perception of footsteps. It's way harder to determine if footsteps are close, like right behind you or down the hall. It's not worth it in my opinion.
---
The topic is "amazing shotties at 10m+"  
---
Only two shotguns perform at that range.
---
sure, my Uplay is "C.Gonzalez." (don't ask why)
---
In CSGO, you can use decoy as decoy flashbang instead of using its sound distraction ability, forcing your enemy to turn away from the grenade as you push.
---
Nah lmao its ur choice lol
---
Says the Blackbeard-on-defence-with-shield-glitch-thing main.
---
*please don't downvote me*
---
Touch√©
---
Why? Just curious. I find casual rounds are way too long and too often an entire team is forced to sit there and watch some dude try to clutch a 1 v 4 for 3 minutes. Add in the fact that you can‚Äôt pick a spawn and you‚Äôre entire team attacks from the same direction. 
---
I think ranked is much more fun because people in general play smarter (this has been diminished somewhat due to crouch-spam-to-win). 
---
^ this, you need a very low update version of the console and they cannot access internet because of the low version.
---
It's an ammo counter because it's an alien pulse rifle. I don't know if it actually works in game.
---
I would have swapped Copper II and Gold II.
---
I enjoyed this
---
Git gud fag
---
Plat 2 good God the text is so true it fucking hurts I dropped down to gold 3 
---
Thats how I do all my macros too. Except I have way more of them.
---
yOu jUsT mIsSeD tHoSE ShOtS
---
Cant hack on either, because you need to jailbreak/crack the consoles, which is impossible on both.
---
I‚Äôm really enjoying more ranked at silver level because there arent mk players 
---
And you can make 200 iq plays like throwing decoy when you have awp then peek so they wouldnt expect it. Other than it has no practical use and sometimes you can detect if thats flash or not based on its appaerence
---
I'm glad someone did.

I love some of rs6's skins but hate some other, and I love some or csgo's skins but hate some other. I partially agree that csgo skins are usually higher quality but I mean, it depends. I had a csgo inventory that I loved (all kinda beaten up camo/old looking skins) that you would usually say that look bad but in that inventory, in the context, everything looked great
---
Two all but worthless guns that you would maybe use for a joke.
---
Or a solid 5 stack
---
BAdPiNG
---
I can't visualize it. Sorry try again
---
Do you have the photo without the text? 
---
So... you abandon your previous point? The game has no shotguns that are amazing at 10+ meters?
---
I‚Äôm down to play only available on Saturday or Sunday night around 7 though maybe later then that. 
---
Tachanka gon give it to ya once you revisit the RPD
---
Do you mean mount it to a deployable shield?
---
Sometimes it's just bad timing. Nowadays I'm playing with my friend who is at low elo and what I realized is that some players just cant "hear well" compared to higher ranks. Sound is one of the most important part of this game.Unfortunately It's messed up in some maps. Your goal should be to be as silent as possible both on defense and attack. If you main fuze then it can be a possible explanation you simply make too much noise. Also for offense in prep phase you should focus on saving your drone and gathering intel. You have huge advantage if you have 2 drones during the round.
---
Give him a bipod, maybe allow him to penetrate the glass slots on riot shields, make him horribly inaccurate when not using his bipod and have a short setup time.
---
Its not that insane tbh. You knew where he was and what direction hed be looking so you did the obvious and outplayed him. 
---
Not at all
---
Nah I know people who log in over 1000 hours in games 
---
Nah
---
I find it funny how apex legends has a ping wheel that involves character dialogue but rainbow only has one yellow ping that barely makes any noise and is hard to see in some cases. Those games are completely different but I think rainbow should have pings like that.
---
Yes this... Sorry for being a noob
---
Cod still has head glitching...
---
Erm. Eh?  
---
You're the one not reading what's being written here.
---
Oh yeah it's still really not realistic at all, but the point of it was never to make it realistic, it was simply to ensure that good positioning would beat movement spamming. Realistic movement would make things way too unbalanced in both CS and R6 because the defenders would have far too big an advantage.
---
Basically, start kinda forces you into buying ops with actually money due to the EXTREMELY slow nature of earning in game. I fell into that trap and ended up spending more than I would have if I bought the standard. But I'm impatient so take it for what its worth
---
The same as unicorns to leprechauns
---
I had a 1v2 lately, they started diffusing, I managed to kill them both and then I ran to the diffuser only to stop right before a claymore, what a feeling!
---
Though maybe as a Doc with Rook armor I could have survived it?
---
Got this ugly after skin in my first legendary. Was bs
---
Its a gift, every ASH main has it. :D
---
wtf is a fixed charge
---
As a solo queuer, I wouldn't be sooo upset if TACTICAL gestures were up for reasonable renown, maybe like 500-2k
---
that's plat 3
---
Can't claim tactical realism when the equipment you portray is correctly portrayed. 
---
Silver two tho
---
So... What were the events leading up to the vote kick?
---
At least break the bottom of the barricade *then* place the Cam
---
console..
---
Have you ever tried the Spas-12 on Valk, killing people with that is fun cause you can spam the trigger be alright at close range.
---
One last thing to say here, Ubi is never going to revisit shotguns unless the entire siege community outside of Reddit demands them so.
---
Good bye 15 mag!
---
I really like that one actually, it's just not super colorful what's the problem?
---
Not too much, i don't even want to look at my wow /played for example lol. But I have a friend with 7k + hs on warframe 
---
You're complaining about spread over range ie how good shotguns are as range increases...
---
I‚Äôve seen someone put a frost mat there and it somehow worked... it made me sad to see it get the down 
---
F
---
Where's the "HOW WAS THAT NOT A HEADSHOT" gesture?
---
https://youtu.be/Skuscoa7Ke4 I know the feeling
---
The VGS from Tribes: Ascend was a neat thing...
---
It's actually good, stop ranting about your prefference to skins..
---
It was just a normal match point
---
I dont understand why people do this. Does anyone know?
---
Plus, it didn't affect your rank, so maybe you felt more liberated?
---
Ok, how about you explain how I'm wrong? Someone else pointed out how I was wrong and actually improved the conversation, unlike this statement. 
---
I really enjoyed this meme. Thank you. Well done! 
---
You get an ugly headgear for 5k at least
---
I jumped in the exact same window and the exact same thing happened to me. It's really frustrating. 
---
I read that in a monotone/depressed voice and I‚Äôm wondering why the hell did this make me laugh so much?üòÇüòÇ
---
Agreed. There would be no way to counter/detect its fake. 
---
Have you guys seen the new Apex Legends ping system? I think something like that could work. Hold down a key and a wheel pops up, like "trap here", "enemy here"
---
I would say Gold 1 is: everytime I'd get Platinum, my team ruins it
---
I wasn‚Äôt bad but not good, but this is the reason I stopped playing rss. It‚Äôs a fun game but I hate how toxic the community is
---
I like hostage, personally.
---
I think it would be a great hardcore mode.
---
Claymore on glaz? Instant kick haha
---
So, this is an artist, making some art about an artist making some art? Sick
---
Nah theyre there they just get harassed every time theyre in soloq voice chat so you never know
---
*John Kelly

Thank you kind sir

OOOOOOF

Gold 1 is legit me haha. I only play bomb with a full 5. Otherwise secure area. I can rely on just myself more.

Hello Kachow-Potato, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/anenoc/this_guys_screen_blacked_out_and_his_teammates/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Just finished playing 10 minutes ago! Loving the game so far, and I don't really enjoy br games. The ping system is pretty good, and I think would really improve communication in Siege.
---
Trust me when I say this; there's always next season.
---
Signed, 
---
Cincinnati Bengals fan
---
Read what exactly I am complaining about.  
---
It's not the width of the spread, it's the donut. And the fact that there is a very large amount of space between entirely useless and good.  And the other fact of you literally saying that there ARE amazing shotguns at 10m+, which is entirely besides the point because THOSE GUNS USE SLUGS AND DO NOT SPREAD.  
---
Seriously. Read. It ain't that hard.
---
Question. When is this happening? With the RTx 2080? I don't know many things about that glitch.
---
I don‚Äôt shoot the hostage because I never play hostage
---
&gt; Ubi is never going to revisit shotguns

:(

Here's the patch notes

[https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/news/152-343114/y3s42-patch-notes](https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/news/152-343114/y3s42-patch-notes)
---
M41A Pulse Rifle. Which was a Thompson SMG with an underbarrel M870 shotgun mocked as a grenade launcher, with a SPAS-12 handguard.
---
But I don't get the wooden pistol grip. Whi Ubi has a fetish for fitting wooden parts on modern looking guns? IMO, they simply don't get along well.
---
&gt; Have you ever tried the Spas-12 on Valk
---
Yeah, it executes at short range pretty well.
---
Now I see why mouse and keyboard on console is such a big problem
---
I‚Äôm more impressed that you fitted through the 2nd hole  
---
Still a great op to have. Can easily make or break a round depending on how she‚Äôs used. 
---
&gt; It's not the width of the spread, it's the donut
---
Which is still complaining about shotties at range...
---
&gt;And the fact that there is a very large amount of space between entirely useless and good
---
Being as "good" with a shotgun means down in 1/2 hits then there isn't space for much between good/not good.
---
&gt;And the other fact of you literally saying that there ARE amazing shotguns at 10m+
---
Something I've never said. You mentioned them, I said they were shite.
---
&gt;Seriously. Read. It ain't that hard.
---
Oh the irony.
---
I was gold 3 at the start of the season
---
now I am playing on toaster
---
As a Gold 3, if I‚Äôm bitching, it‚Äôs about Blackbeard 
---
Thank you, OP. Very cool! 
---
Omg thanks, I saw 28/01 I thought it was the last one, my bad.
---
Is this great devil a hitbox by chance?
---
Same thing happened to me yesterday. Team i joined was down 0-2 and i got a 4k on the round I joined and then they all kicked me.

[Can confirm](https://i.etsystatic.com/18245486/r/il/690fae/1585916878/il_570xN.1585916878_ftjg.jpg)

Better late than never

Because they‚Äôre pissed they died and don‚Äôt want to wait

Plasma Pink is badass and don‚Äôt you ever clucking forget it.
---
The game launched as it was updating for me, and after updating indeed. Pack gone.
---
üòÖ
---
Best part is he's about to win the round too. Like you don't have to wait much longer?
---
No problem, it's a pretty big one in terms of balancing.

While you are correct, the opinion of many is that they *should*.

I was expecting him to be extremely low HP but he's full.

Maybe 1/4 of the games I play aren‚Äôt full of TKers, smurfs, or generally toxic players on xbox. I‚Äôd like to get to a good server, but they don‚Äôt seem to exist on xbox. 
---
I didn‚Äôt

These are too good

I credited him

It's not the xbox  "community". It's just people, period.
---
We have no horse in the "console war" race, our family has had every major console that has come out since Atari days, including floppy PC gaming. I wish I could beat it into everyone's head that it is not ONE particular community. If you go to playstation reddit, there are people that complain about the toxicity there as well and look on to greener pastures of PC and xbox. They're going to be disappointed, too.
---
There are literally just as many assholes on PC and PS that are going to make fun of you for no damn reason other than their life sucks and they want to feel better about themselves by talking shit to someone else. Fuck em, dude. Just feel bad when I see people talking about wasting money and abandoning one community for another, when in the end, it's all the same. 
---
I bought the game on sale last year... i had to uninstall since people kept kicking me out of matches... sure i was new to it but i didnt even get a chance üòÇüòÖ
---
Looking for some people to play with as well, not a great player and mostly play casual. If you're looking to play just add me. Uplay: Cruckman4
---
Are you trolling?
---
Never said it was
---
Same here.  Haven't played since September last year as I was sick and tired of how broken this game STILL is.  Still subscribed in case Ubisoft gets their heads out of the ass and actually fixes the game (like that will ever happen).  OP's post is another reason I quit as well, the incredibly toxic community.  "jUsT pLaY wItH fRiEnDs!"  That's great in theory, but my friends and I aren't always on at the same time.

wHeRe'S hEr tHiCc tHiGhS?

Only joking. Amazing work here, mate.

 It mine credit to u/traxim
---
I have just shown you proof.
---
Who cares? Sure. Some use XIM but.not everybody like you claim.
---
Hori does exactly the same thing XIM does. XIM too is only emulating the analogue input andbis not true KB+M.
---
Still don't see why that would negatively impact your aim.
---
How about watching the flank? How can you forget the hole in the wall you made yourselves to plant in the first place?
---
I love these discord memes there great
---
I got kicked the other day in a similar scenario.  Was pretty confusing as I was actually playing good for once :p
---
Not at the moment no. It‚Äôs only me

and which op you go for. GIGN, FBI, etc
---
I like it. But it's not legendary. Epic at best.
---
Yeah why would he need to add that 
---
Yes. Before you know it op, you'll be diamond
---
They don't care about winning. They just think it's fun kicking others.
---
Forget watching the bomb. How about looking over your flank?
---
&gt;An example about how toxic xbox casual can be
---
I have this and love it. I'll take nice, simplistic over flashy, obnoxious every day.
---
So you suck at the game or don't play it I see
---
I dont like console people for this reason.
---
Hey at least you have good ping

Here comes the smurfs

True, i had this ones i was winning had 100% and got injured by cav from 10 meter 1 pixel snipe very Nice kick it was üëåüèº
---
Nice
---
Unfortunately, I ended up doing the same, and the directories in the Uplay version and the steam version are different so its most likely that this isn't possible.
---
Operation helath is basically a three month priod that will be dedicated to FiXiNg and Reparinth the GAME. jeez get it right. but in all seriousness wtf?
---
Yeah how toxic it CAN be 
---
Not it is the most toxic etc jsnjsnss
---
But maybe i should have worded it better but ehh
---
I had a PC game where both teams were thing to team kill and lose and the game went on for rounds and rounds, toxic communities are sad 
---
Console. It's the same on PS. I get shot in the back by a teammate everytime I do well. Toxic children on a more accessible platform is what I always assumed. 
---
Almost have an ace on defend? 
---

That‚Äôs a stupid fucking thing to kick someone out, I guess you got the attention span of a roach
---
Excuse my ~~aim~~ **claymore**
---
Eh I don't see it. 
---
You can't kick when it's 0-2 lmao.
---
You should stop taking cocaine
---
I didn‚Äôt make this credit to u/traxim 
---
Ill just take it as youre trolling because you got to be joking buddy.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve stopped playing casual entirely because of this. It‚Äôs just cancer. I just play ranked and pray I meet people who aren‚Äôt idiots who have mics
---
Honestly they shouldn't be playing this game if all they do is rush. That only works on an enemy team that sucks and/or doesn't communicate.
---
Or maybe it's just something to spice up casual and give it some stakes 
---
:( its casuaallalalalalla
---
Let me experiment 
---
I really like my pulse rifle
---
Or the ability to think rationally. 
---
Casual just feels boring compared to SI Playlist
---
Maybe put what platform you are playing on, as R6Siege does not support cross-play.
---
Got ya, we could have but there isn‚Äôt a button to immediately leave a game in siege so the third guy probably would‚Äôve have killed one of us and we just couldn‚Äôt be bothered. Wanted to get away from the toxic people asap

It pisses me off that Recruit wears a ski mask and goggles but his icon wears a beret

An alpha pack or an invitational pack?

i got a similar clip yesterday on the same map as recruit. lmao

I've switched TV/monitors before, with quite a big size difference. Aim wasn't affected. It's not like getting a new TV changes your sensitivity or anything.
---
Welcome to the world of video games.
---
Sorry, but that is not the same. Is a controller/racing wheel officially considered cheating in that game? If so, IT IS CHEATING. End of discussion. Furthermore, a controller/racing wheel is allowed natively in most pc racing games, so it is equally available to everyone, whereas cheating with a mouse and keyboard requires expensive 3rd party equipment. Additionally, the advantage given by a controller/racing wheel in a racing game is nowhere near as large as the advantage given by a mouse and keyboard in Siege. Using a mouse and keyboard on console is the equivalent of hacking on pc, but I guess that's a non-issue, because why should people whine about people using ThIrD pArTy SoFtWaRe to their advantage instead of playing the game "in the way it's supposed to be played".
---
My game keeps crashing after this update. It's fine in casual, but in ranked, it's everytime after 10 or so seconds... Don't know what to do, I never had any problems before :/
---
Blyatiful
---
Not just Xbox, PS4 as well. What you did right there is the exact same thing my friend did and he was kicked. I don't get it.
---
Thx for the tip üòÅ forgot that
---
bE GrRAtfUL yOu GOt soMeTHiNg 
---
Thats what this sub told me when my legendary was just the color pink
---
They should really change what skins are legendary
---
Pretty disgusting that no one understands it's a pulse rifle skin from alien, are you all under 18 or something?
---
Most people you meet in game are ok but when you meet those kind of people it ruins the whole experience and it really it is a shame cos i just had a match where someone was calling out enemy positions and we done amazing yet three matches down the line and i could be kicked or team killed for jack shit
---
If ubi enable native support for mnk they'll be able to detect if the user is using a controller or a mnk (but not if they use an adapter), as soon as you switch device you get kicked or the game doesn't unpause until you use a controller.
---
You gon get A+++
---
no this is the patch for the caveira pistol nerf, mp5 nerf, and clash buff
---
Just hope they don‚Äôt shoot the claymore as they finish you off, negating the whole plan
---
Your aim wasn't even that bad in the clip.
---
It's not toxcicity, it's comedy gold
---
kill cams are awful in this game don't fret 
---
Unique style. Maybe you can alter the background a bit to balance the top left? Or at least make the red take up exactly half the background. Right now it almost looks like the background is ‚Äúunfinished‚Äù
---
But all in all, very neat.
---
Those were some sexy one shot entry holes,
---
ur a shit player - sincerely, plat 3 at 3302
---
If you dont get the reference you're a pleb.
---
I like it
---
Sweaty fucking tryhard 
---
The most toxic kick I ever received was because I called someone out who said 'clutch or kick'
---
This means even the guy I _defended_ voted to kick me
---
I'm not of female-ness, right, but I am pretty sure I can just chalk it up to people wanting teammates who will carry them. If the other person sounds weak, they probably will rape them to pieces. Maybe try a voice changer.
---
I know exactly how u feel, the same is with bo4
---
Damn I‚Äôm ps4
---
That is why you should play w me
---
Oh!!! Okay yeah that must suck. For me, I don't get that toxic of games all the time but when I do they are EXTREMELY toxic. Once I had a guy who was so mad at me for not killing this one guy that he followed me around the map, destroyed all my equipment (I was Jager btw), and o my Tked me during an important fight, and did that over and over. Thank God I got him banned by walking in front if his bullets  
---
Not if the mods like them
---
I think I sound like a 12yr old boy so it would make sense.
---
Ash is balanced. 
---
By theory yes 
---
Ah ok, must be the last option. I've left, rejoined, same thing. They all left, ended in 1 vs 5. Killed one though but they are back now 
---
Team killing is still an issue. What will be the next big problem is DNBO.
---
Why not but my english isn't the best
---
I have a ps4 but don‚Äôt have siege on it haha
---
After skull rain, it personally became a challenge to see how far i could solo que within a given season. Highest ive been solo is plat 2.....having said that. Gold 3 is the most toxic fucking cesspool of overly horomonal teens, and basement dwelling adults i have ever encountered in gameplay.
---
I couldnt beleive it
---
Do you actually ask people to play?
---
It came off as toxic or being aggressive at least, and monkey see monkey do. 
---
Learn the maps, form up a party if possible, find your a main that feels right to you, adjust controls to suit you, watch your old clips and see what you're doing wrong or what the opponent is doing right. 
---
If nothing else works they're most likely smurfs and you can't do anything but find another game. (Fyi, There is a penalty ban for leaving an ongoing game)

I‚Äôd say though her win delta is relatively normal, there has to be some reason she‚Äôs picked so often which is why i suggested balancing.
---
You do realize that they reguralized the hitboxes between all armor types?
---
Thats horrible, you had that clutch then they had to be like that. Hope you dont run into anybody like that again man!
---
True...............but if I get hot pink you believe I'ma rock that on alot of guns üòÇ

Toxicity exists anywhere in the internet. It becomes much more severe every year. 
---
Haha don't care mine isn't the best either, I'm spanish
---
Last night while playing on PC, I had someone on the opposing team crying  in chat because "you're so bad, you had to use a frag grenade to kill me."  I was on rappel outside big window on house, and he was Echo behind a shield in that corner of workshop that everyone loves to hide in.  So the next game, we get matched up against him again, and this time he cried because he rushed me as Blitz and got caught in a Frost mat.  "You're so bad, you have to hide behind a Frost mat."
---
Don't get me wrong, I play on Xbox and PC, and Xbox is without a doubt way more toxic, but PC is it's own brand of stupid, lol.
---
So what you‚Äôre saying is you have the mentality of a monkey?
---
Also wdym by they‚Äôre near impossible to replace? Do I have to disassemble the whole thing?
---
She's simple to use, but doesn't have an impactful gadget like a Thatcher, Thermite, etc.
---
Bruh moment
---
Yes, but judging by how often i hear people complain about Ash‚Äôs hitbox compared to, say, Hibana‚Äôs, it shows that she might have a worse proportioned hitbox.
---
Ubisoft said her role was a fragger. They aren't going to "nerf/balance" her. Her last change made her R4-C a better candidate than her G36C and they gave her stun grenades. She is designed for solo fragging.
---
Yes I did just suddenly came up with the idea to post this because if you look at the comments, I explained that this was raw footage I got from instant replay of a kid in my game explaining this. I don‚Äôt watch Get Flanked and so I didn‚Äôt see this. That kid that showed us this is probably a subscriber of Get Flanked. No need to be an asshole. 
---
OP: original post
---
*bruh sound effect no.2*
---
Yes and it works out sometimes but more then half the time they try to kick me or start asking for all my social media.
---
Now that‚Äôs fair, but what about her made her be picked so much?
---
Honestly the hitbox is the same than IQ and hibana, she should have a slower rpm that I agree on and a 25 rounds mag. Then she'd still be a good operator but not a must pick to frag. That would give more space to others like capitao and IQ imo
---
I get Tked and voted on ps just because of my name, which is similar to my name here, I‚Äôve also won 1 on 3s and 1 on 4s and been voted out 
---
I guess you can say that if it helps you sleep at night, can we not just agree to disagree, I'm trying to do school work. 
---
I disagree. Had a teammate with an insanely racist name that our team took turns killing to ensure they didn't get to play. 
---
I have 750 hours in the game, I think I understand 
---
That sledge though, he was ready to crack your skull like a peanut. XD 
---
I‚Äôll stop talking when you stop replying. 
---
Neko, you‚Äôre correct. Other dude was too lazy to look at the rest of the comments. 
---
Happened to me 4 times on pc in a week... your not alone 
---
And that‚Äôs perfectly fair, but there has to be some reason why she would be so much better at fragging than other operators and why they would make an op like this in a ‚Äútactical‚Äù game.
---
What did Vigil say?
---
Wow very mature 
---
Muzzle break on Mira *lul*
---
Let's remove Vote To Kick.
---
Well I wouldn‚Äôt know because I‚Äôm not lacking, however I can see the issue for the people who struggle with girthage.
---
I like this suggestion, because it would balance out her R4-C which is too good imo.
---
Makes sense, I‚Äôll probably have to
---
She's 3 speed, she is great for solo queue, and the R4-C is quite good but no where near the level of Twitch's F2 or Jackal's C7E. 
---
I have a post on my page if you wanna see that for an idea to rebalance her pick rate :)
---
Trying to play the maturity card? Okay. Stop procrastinating and get to work
---
Yeah took me a second to figure that out. 
---
Yes, it would. I myself upgraded my starter account to standard.
---
Playing on PS4, I can confirm it is as bad as on Xbox (if not worse)
---
You cant really buy laptop graphics cards. Plus the laptop you have doesn't have one to begin with. 
---
Tldr laptops are not modular 
---
Why didn't you tk? please put that thing out of its miser
---
Fair point, but I believe that both of those were nerfed more than removing 2 points of damage to balance out the weapons, plus Jackal has a brilliant SMG too.
---
Bruh relax it apex just released and people are already acting like its gonna take the world over
---
but where do they get it from. id rather not buy from amazon and buy the codes myself 
---
SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS

Ah, am I still able to install a graphics card though? 
---
Ruined by watermark
---
I‚Äôll check it out ;)

I was platinum the first few seasons and lost interest because it‚Äôs a game for children.

neat thanks for the quick reply

Not internally. You may be able to use an external one if you have a thunderbolt 3 port 
---
!Remindme 12 days
---
If you on ps4 we always got 3/5 for ranked so long as you like a silver we don‚Äôt mind playing with ya
---
Not just Xbox, we PlayStationers get this too often as well.

I wish they gave fuze an RPG and The Lord a helikcopter mounted minigun.
---
Most of the time the card is hardcore soldered on. Also you‚Äôd have to disassemble it and void any warranty you have on it. Plus there‚Äôs no guarantee you‚Äôd find a card good enough to run Siege and fit in your laptop
---
its cuz most of people take twitch because of her gun
---
if you played on PS4 I'd b down to play / well this game is supposed to be fun and it's more so when you have friends or are making them so I hope you meet some people :/ or you could switch to PC that's my plan lol
---
Understood, thanks for the help! 
---
The sad fact of the matter is UBI doesn't care. Console is a platform that they don't care about. It provides little revenue for them compared to PC and ESL. Additionally, you're dealing with UBI who is notoriously slow at even patching the littlest things. Just remember it took them 2.5 years to get rid of drop shotting. They will do absolutely nothing to stop this. 
---
This is the first clip on here where someone is using a controller and it doesn't look like it. fantastic analog stick work my friend!
---
Unpopular opinion maybe, but I liked the longer rounds. Sometimes a master plan takes time to execute. 
---
Not do I, but I do think the "it's how you use it" statement is false in that particular scenario lol
---
Actually I really like the look of this skin :( it‚Äôs simple, but it gives a very nice tactics look. Plus I love the number counter on the side 
---
I'm not, you just acted immature and I'm finished my work now 
---
It's usual that guys will act nice to get the attention of a girl, but idk about kicking... You just need to find a group of friends you know and can play with and ignore the toxicity, especially if you play on Xbox.
---
Sure :)
---
Ig I‚Äôm finally buying siege on my ps4 
---
Im sure you can get one just wait for the right match and boom
---
&gt;GG VP sir.
---
Gud gem very pleasure :)

Welp thanks for the new Ash wallpaper ‚ù§
---
Lets juust delete her and all her mains 
---
This is soo Gay
---
Dude, read the conversation I linked, the dude was literally asking if he was allowed to use mouse and keyboard, it‚Äôs an open question, Ubisoft could have said ANYTHING, the ball was in Ubisofts court to say it was not allowed. 
---
Tell you what, I‚Äôll message Ubisoft now acting as though I play on console and admit to using keyboard and mouse. That way they won‚Äôt need to prove anything because I‚Äôll just confess, let‚Äôs see if Ubisoft ban me for cheating. If you would bother to read the code of conduct it clearly says that cheating is punishable via permanent ban. I guarantee nothing will happen. 
---
No
---
I got the standard edition 
---
This is useful, but 3 frost traps all in same spot? Crazy or genius depending on the outcome.
---
Exactly why I moved to PC.
---
Yeah, I guess it helps to have a teammate or 2 to counter act it if it happens. 
---
I mean, it's all the same regardless, someone who gets reported a lot will be banned anyways. 
---
They don't need to specify as they're all pooled together.

---
Clearly the Ginger bread skin is OP. 
---
can someone explain since this potato quality doesn't do it?
---
I say it as a joke obviously, is there people who actually kick?
---
Standard edition includes SAS, FBI, GIGN, GSG-9, and Spetsnaz. You're saying you don't have these factions?
---
This is just unacceptable. As flanked said in the video, I have no clue how nobody knew this was a thing yet. In my eyes, this is a very, very easy fix, but it'll probably take Ubisoft more than a year to even fix it. 
---
Just **PLEASE** put out a Second Operation Health. In fact, I would be perfectly fine with year one always being an Operation Health, and to just fix major issues they find throughout the year. I don't even care if we fewer operators and maps throughout the year this time around.
---
Wow that was really mean

Tbh it‚Äôs your own fault if you can‚Äôt clutch 1v5 /s

Hello mr_elite, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/anh4jd/directional_audio_seems_to_be_broken_after_update/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
You do realize this is not unique to Xbox or R6, correct?
---
These are genius!
---
All the time. At least to me. Struggles of a Cav sometimes
---
Exactly. Plat and Diamond console players have thumbs. I don‚Äôt know where these clips and low (like 20) sens and zero gamesense come from. That‚Äôs why PC players think we all suck
---
What platform you on?
---
If I wasn‚Äôt going to hell before, I am now.
---
This is why I stopped playing this game with randoms on PC. Too many toxic people. Can‚Äôt play a single match without random teammates killing each other and vote kicking for no reason. Even in ranked I get trolls.
---
Mnk is a bad problem and it sucks but if Microsoft and Sony don‚Äôt do anything they‚Äôll just have to fix crouch spam
---
PS4 so that has something to do with it
---
It‚Äôs about the majority, not the individual

Not only does it look good AF it even has the ammo counter on the side like in Alien.

Which one is "this is my other account"?

"What are you in hell for?"

"I ruined Bandit's smiley faces."

"You're going to the bottom of the pit."

Everything is good but all the weapons feel terrible to use.

THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS "FUN"  IN RANKED M8

It's circled in the bottom right.

Who cares about rank lmfao

...um yea? Not even a joke, i cant have a civilized conversation with any playstation player after i say i play on xbox, your one of the few.
---
Well hello Thatcher Main, I'm not toxic, I promise
---
Refund it and buy the standard edition.
---
What changed 
---
Ya I've been kicked after getting 3 or 4k's, dying after I was outplayed or I just made a mistake

Im at bronze2 and i suck cock

Yes but why not have a system on top of that for no mics. Just have it on test servers to see if it works. Stop shutting down any idea like this whole sub does quite often.
---
It's not real. But they just spawned in and his shield icons are showing up as broken/zero hp on the shields.
---
As someone who has never played R6S, what tf happened?
---
Law enforcement is catching on, they specifically mention gamers.

---
"this is a major problem"
---
its so not... its a highly specialized one which nobody noticed since its happening maybe 2% of the time at best when playing against a caveira.
---
"nobody noticed this issue" because until he lost that firefight, got salty and went through the footage to look for excuses he JUST happen to discover this. there are very few tables / drawers with that kind of length stretching into a long hallway to give cav this specific advantage. he didnt even bother reproducing this outcome on other maps because he simply doesnt remember how many long hallways give that kind of cover for caveira to duck behind.
---
clickbaity trash.

I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve said audibly ‚ÄúWhat? He wasn‚Äôt there on my screen?‚Äù 
---
Thank you didn‚Äôt realize I‚Äôm this mentally challenged 
---
I thought that only applied to Bethesda
---
It doesn't matter the device you're on or how shit or good you're. Someone/a group of people are gonna be fuck heads. Sorry to see you wreck 4 people and then get kicked because your team sucked. Keep playing you will find people who aren't shit heads. But it's few and far between, so I wish you good luck! 
---
Can we get a mira on that wall? N-NANIIII
---
Same, and it drives me crazy.
---
Yw. It happens to everyone occasionally.
---
Every time I solo in casual with out a friend, I‚Äôm almost guaranteed to either get TK‚Äôd by my teammates or get kicked. Literally every single time. It‚Äôs 0-0 why the hell you kicking me, the match just started!? It‚Äôs getting to the point where I‚Äôm getting team killed even in ranked. So frustrating..
---
extra thicc
---
No, he needs to spawnpeek. Make it 3 speed 3 armour and it‚Äôs a deal
---
Tactical and strategic? Hello no. What tactics and strategies have you seen nowadays?
---
They're not playing to win. It's to "fuck around." 
---
Same shit happened to me while using Fuze. I got 3 kills with his Cluster Charge and got kicked because I took out most of the opposition. Apparently not letting your teammates get some kills gets you kicked.
---
Ubisoft should take her out of the game and bring her back once this is fixed because holy fuck is that an advantage..
---
You have no clue about the game, do you? You are just some random shitter who thinks they know what's good for the game. Thank the heavens you don't have any say on this.
---
I hate when you are the last one standing, yku kill one but lose the match anyway and they don't kick you but one stupid fuck tells you that you suck, and I'm like "bitch I'm not the one who went in there all gun ho and go shot in the face, like a fucking idiot."
---
Not really. Any time I go against him, 9/10 times I beat him.
---
I need more of these discord memes
---
It's the same on Ps4. I got a ace clutch the other day and then tk'd and removed the round right after.
---
Technically not, however you are a huge asshole if you do since it is a huge advantage that not everyone has.
---
With 100 people on it.
---
#amazing
---
I also got banned from R6 discord because I expressed my experiences with R6 on Xbox being worse than pc

theres a few nasty ARs already on defence. with what i said is that t moves the spawn peak from doc, to jager, and vigil.

could you explain how you did it? there's a guy below that says you have to refund it.
---
Isnt it considered third party hardware?
---
That's interesting bc BB trashes people in my games, what rank are you in btw because BB does have different effects depending on rank
---
&gt;Add a permanent delay to leave the game when downed
---
FTFY
---
D: r00d
---
This meme is so fucking shit lol
---
Lmao and the round wasnt even one minute in when the kicks came out. Thats pathetic, sorry they ruined your ace
---
You can't use it in ranked, it will result in a ban if you get caught
---
I don't think if their a friend or not changes if it's okay or not. If you would kick someone for being afk you shouldn't try to hold your friends spot. It's extremely hypocritical.
---
please for the love of anything do not suggest coconut bruh
---
Ummmmm what? Only on pc has anyone actually done a clutch or kick. Xbox was infinitely less toxic when I played.
---
Well then seems like we need that pick-ban system in ranked now more than ever. 
---
So this only can happen in casual and Ubi will be encouraged to fix it and at the same time we wont lose anything in ranked.
---
One thing I learned is that these glitches seem to never end and atleast a new one shows up almost every season and ubi needs time to fix them. so we always have conflict with some OP operator or game breaking bugs everyday, these bugs will never stop to annoy us, unless we have pick and ban ASAP!

Blackbeard. Hence why they keep nerfing him

I am new but when I got my first rank it was Gold 2, so it was great not having any DLC ops, big oof.
---
Capitao? God i nearly forgot about him, i just see him so rarely
---
always fun getting a terrible screenshot

Basically when cav uses silent step while crouching, her character model dips down lower than a standard crouch, but her pov doesn't change. Which means she can see and shoot over certain low obstacles while being completely hidden to the attacker.
---
spawnpeeking is irrelevant imo. 
---
Blackbeard, he breaks a fundamental game mechanic.
---
Tachanka, a stationary turret has little value in what this game has become.
---
Looks like it was thrown down the driveway for that battle-worn look.
---
It really depends on the barrel. If its a rifled barrel and a rifled slug then no, they have different ranges
---
That doesn't mean he's OP. Any character can seem OP in the right hands however just because he's dangerous in one Tier doesn't mean They are OP.
---
Examples - Setting up a Mira window in closet in Laundry room in Oregon to face the stairs and hatch. Having rotate holes to get into OBJ, having lesion mines on potential rush routes, and having a roamer in church to delay and waste time for the attackers.
---
Those are strategic plays. 
---
Have you killed their hard breachers? Good, now hatch cannot be open and that is no longer a threat, focus on blue stairs and yellow stairs. 
---
Clash or Lion. They are insanely broken,and all the nerds and buffs and reworks in the world can't fix them in Ubisoft's eyes
---
most people think it's better &amp; the only people that don't have gae
---
I saw the counter on there and thought "Looks like it's trying to be an M41A pulse rifle"
---
You could go to gamestop and buy a used game for like $20 it‚Äôs not that much so I think u should
---
Ubisoft has stated before that using K&amp;M on console is a bannable offense. However they dont act on so there is nothing stopping. It is just known that people who use K&amp;M on console are hated and shunned by the community.
---
If you want to use a K&amp;M, just get into the PC version of R6
---
Yeah. Feels kind of weird that the Standard version is sold at the same or even lower price point than Starter during promo sales. I have to wonder what is Ubisoft's logic for this.
---
How long is it out for?

wow my meme has made it to reddit n i c e
---
Now with salt and teamkilling; spicy chat and sweaty cheese
---
How does your TV have anything to do with your aim? 
---
Your k/d isn't what ranked elo is based on
---
Only W/L matters. Individual contribution has no effect on ranking up, or down.
---
its a test done on xbox and ps4 itself not on rainbow six siege xbox and ps4 players `ok`
---
That's not true at all. Sure, the tumblr part of the fanbase loved it, but the rest saw through the publicity stunt. 
---
&gt; Worst part about it is I have even joined parties and people just now openly admit they are k+m user because they know nothing can be done about it.
---
This is why Ubi just needs to enable it with their own separate lobbies. Add all the same mnk support you have on PC, both console makers now allow it. 
---
Imo this game is more enjoyed with a mnk. I think you would have zero issue filling those lobbies and I think it would bring better balance at the higher ends of ranked.

You gain and lose rank depending on if you win or not. KDA is not related.

XP is meaningless in this game. It literally gives you nothing but a number next to your username

I'm honestly ok with her crouching so low. They just need to match her height with the players perspective. This is broken

its a survey done on all 3 platforms and not on the specific game (r6) and i'm saying r6 ps4 players are much better than xbox r6 players. done and duster.

Not everyone people just afraid to comment that they don't like it because they don't want to get downvoted

bit late chief

I see, I don‚Äôt play casual unless none of my friends are on

im guessing your a xbox player and you answered yourself.

Reeeeeeepost

PS app. I‚Äôm pretty sure you can do it on that.

ikr all these people tryna be clever in the comments lol
---
You got downvoted for this but Get_Flanked did video exactly on this asking people about it. He was flooded with responses of people saying they use mnk because they like the input better but can‚Äôt for example afford a pc. 
---
There are soooo many reasons why native mnk use is much better than using one of these emulators. 
---
This is actually a old coconut brah video. Ever since than I do this everytime on theme park with valk
---
I know but enough people like it that r6 twitter tweeted my video :)
---
That's true. Forgot about that option like in csgo
---
Fortnite seems to do it just fine even with crossplay enabled too
---
Yea when I played today I got around 130. I usually get 180-190.
---
Glaz have better explain!!... "DETAILS"
---
This is my feelings exactly, I stopped playing for nearly 6 months and I came back to try out the new S.I. mode and literally every game was full of being team killed, voted to kick or just players harassing me the whole time. Xbox community is awful. Not to mention if you even look at the enemy team the wrong way they‚Äôll be sending you all kinds of hate mail calling you trash. It‚Äôs sad to be honest. 
---
Thanks alot! I've been struggling with him. As I stated ppl pull off these insane rushes where they insta kill us, yet if I try to do something of that sort, I die instantly
---
Yeah if you think this is bad you should play PC

I was in the same position as you and playing alone at my first 20 lvls into the game wasn't fun when the randoms tend to be toxic.

To be fair, I thought it was a little funny, even if it was mean

---
This is definitely true. I once did a Doc spawn peek once, and I kept doing it for the rest of the match. Sorry other team :(
---
He‚Äôs the bestest recruit 
---
1.3k people have no taste 
---
This isn‚Äôt a thing Ubi can fix hence why it is a problem across the board for games on console. It‚Äôs just easier to notice in games like Siege and PUBG because how important accuracy with no aim assist is. 
---
tbh this is one reason I switched to PC (*note that toxicity/team-killing still happens)* I found that because the environment was more "competitive" based i saw way less team-killing and found that most toxicity was from gamechat and an occasional 'kill yourself ur so bad kid XXDD" which that i can completely ignore, im sorry this stuff is still prevalent on consoles though guys, no one should have to be kicked because they are good :(
---
also: sorry for any grammatical mistakes, 2 broken fingers and a thumb broke too, hard to type and play for that matter.

Yes exactly, the other 2 aren't usedm so probably for the new ops

It‚Äôs usually how people work. Right now as soon as people started complaining about lean crouch spamming everyone‚Äôs abusing it until it‚Äôs reworked

Both are allowed on the consoles, but must be enabled by the developers. You can‚Äôt just plus a mnk in then play Siege on console, you need a device that will emulate a controller first.

On ps app its private avatar only

You should see his performance in The Wire. Jordan was born to be an acting powerhouse

There's just one operator without an elite in each vanilla ctu so maybe one day...

No it's not. It's in the cam cycle controls

For some reason they like it when people get mad at them for trolling like that so I don‚Äôt get mad to give them the pleasure of such a thing

What?

The man is right... people left a rank match when you‚Äôre the lowest rank oh nooooo. Just saying you‚Äôre probably the 10th person to upload about teammates leaving. just stop posting this shit

Discreet Blitz buff
---
Yeah someone ran in front of me earlier and it sounded like they were behind me.
---
Bruh I was always wondering how that happened to me. Good to know I'm not blind/crazy

Yes happens all the time when you get into a good lobby and eliminate all but 1 they usually kick on Xbox.
---
Nice 4k at least
---
You might have to click on the top of the vid because its not loading for me but it might for you
---
Nah they weren't. We played against them the match before with a different random. Ty for answer
---
I have the same thing going on with me too. But it's off an on. One day I played all day, and it happened about 3 times. But I'm having a glitch where I lose all sound and then my game crashes later. 
---
What about fps drop when you get hit by the yokai?
---
Ill play
---
This.  I know a guy who openly admits to using MnK on xbox because of a disability.  He lost his right thumb, index, and middle finger and a large chunk of his right hand while in Afghanistan.

He stays on xbox instead of PC because of friends hes made and doesnt want to deal with rampant hackers.

Shields not facing the same direction for user and enemy.  Weapons seemingly doing minimal  damage at close range. Walls being destroyed for some but not others making a perfectly fine wall on one screen that you can be shot through.

---
Oui
---
I want to meet the fuck who thinks 'Guy didn't clutch the round for us in a 1v5/1v4, deserves to be kicked'.
---
I like playing on PC this doesn't happen, but every now and then you get added to a group of 4 friends playing and you're their Randy so they each take turns killing you at the start of the round. I hate toxic players. 
---
Sony sell his own MnK set that works with every game even if the developer doesn't give native support for MnK
---
This man here, hemakes the most sense in this pointless thread.
---
Sound bug has been prevalent for me this season as well, in the drone phase after a jump it just puts all sound on the left ear at the same volume regardless of distance, and also bugs the end screen. Its fixed by restarting the game but obviously its a major disadvantage during the round
---
Ur so gudüòÇ
---
My game keeps crashing after the new update
---
That's not the joke of the picture at all =O
---
That‚Äôs why they are not letting out the consolt update yet
---
Or just get a half decent report system and support staff that act on clear footage of exploiters and verbal abuse. 
---
The little lag spike? Not sure, really crap timing I guess. But I‚Äôve been in too many gunfights where that happens and I keep shooting the still body only to die myself, so I just sprayed all over this time and hoped for the best 
---
They were aware that she may have been fake before it came out, but they did announce he was gay after to try to change the subject
---
I don‚Äôt really believe that, so we‚Äôll have to just agree to disagree. I believe a good team with coordination can beat the staunchest of defensive holds. The other issue with the current system is people are only banning crutch operators on both sides (in my experience) which lends itself heavily to the defensive side whenever the offensive bans are Lion, Blitz, Dokkaebi, Jackal, and maybe a hard breacher. The defensive bans are usually compromised of Cav, Vigil, maybe one of the intel ops. The issue with the game as far as meta goes currently is that intel defenders have to be banned otherwise there are too many resources to keep eyes on the attackers.
---
In addition to that, with anti intel ops like IQ seeing less play nowadays, you can quickly see how the issue gets out of hand and the attackers are left getting pinged the whole round. 
---
In conclusion, you have to be able to play both sides effectively and make sure you play your bans right in context of both the map especially as well as maybe a recurring opponent with a good grasp on a certain operator. Take Joystick on Team Empire for example. He is an Ash/Jager main and the one time that the other team banned Ash Empire almost got beat. No one is banning Ash when they play him and he‚Äôs running amok in EU pro league right now.
---
Just my 2 cents 
---
TL;DR- Don‚Äôt suck at attacking and play bans correctly or you might deserve that 0-3 hole
---
...Do I delete my reddit now?
---
I wish I knew 
---
About that. The goal is to win, if winning doesn't have a place in your rank. It'll just turn into an even bigger toxic fuckfest and people will start playing it like an arcade shooter

Season pass holder? Pc or console?

Jokers can have unintended consequences (e.g. "It's just a prank bro") that can have a real effect on people. Like perpetuating some stupid idea that Ubisoft didn't deliver there promise to "fix every issue with the game" during operation health.

But it‚Äôs still an emulator is what I‚Äôm saying. I wish more people would talk about it than XIM because that is something I think could easily be changed by Sony. I‚Äôve known about XIM‚Äôs for years but found out about that one like this week and that it‚Äôs on their damn store.

Me 2, sometimes it occurres, usually has something to do with the drones. Sound is all f'ed up, left is right and vice versa. Far away gunfights sound like there behind you close, and close sounds are reversed. Very annoying when in ranked.

My most used attacker is Blitz, don't wanna hear it

I completely love this game, I play a ton of solo though and the community absolutely disgusts me. I wish people didn't act like such jerk offs with their anonymity. I have had multiple instances as well where I've defended some random on the mic from an asshole, calling them out for being toxic. Then I've had the other people on our team, all of us solo queued, jump on mic in support of the toxic dude. The community is fucked.

---
I love you.
---
Nohomo.
---
This is what I don't understand. I'm still playing casual since I don't know the maps well enough to feel comfortable playing ranked. 3 out of my 5 games are idiots running out of spawn, getting spawn killed or Ash rushing into objective, getting killed, and then leaving the game first round.
---
I'm a fairly bad player, but I think you played so well and your aim was really good! It infurated me even though I knew what was coming. I'm sorry you had to deal with it.
---
Have you ever seen Doc's "tavernier bleu"? Probably, because it's literally a Blue mesh on his black helmet. And it's legendary.
---
I remember once in ranked our team was taking a beating and the score was 1:3 on Coastline. We were defending kitchen (don't ask me why) and we lost 3 of our members 30 seconds into the round from a rushing ash. All hope was lost when my last teammate died after taking one down with him. They start playing over confident and I get two kills. It's a 1v2 and I have defuser control. An attacker peeked me, but the second the attacker peeked the round was over. My team had surrendered. My jaw dropped as I started hearing my french teammates (I know very fitting) started laughing saying I would never win it. To this day I still remeber their ubisoft usernames in the coincidence I meet them. Then I will show them...

Well half of the enemy team was near afk, I'll give you the first 2 kills, but the last 3, those 2 were trolling and started shooting last second and pulse didn't even bother

If he's doing this he'll eventually be kicked for idling if he's just sitting there. Otherwise there aren't many cases of this since the glitch is ridiculously hard to do apparently.
---
My FPS is dropping hard, hope this gets fixed sooner than later!
---
It's not sensible criticism, it's YOUR SUBJECTIVE OPINION and frankly your opinions are not worth shit. 
---
Any bright skin is UP TO YOU if you want to use it. You DON'T NEED TO RUN BRIGHT PINK SKINS. But you can if you want to, and it isn't a bad thing. Personalization is very important in making a succesful online multiplayer game, people want to stand out and be unique, distinguish themselves from other players. 
---
Not being able to sit in a dark corner is just a bonus. It's not promoting healthy gameplay to sit in a dark corner where you can't be seen in a competitive shooter. Those spots have been patched out over the years for the most part, and the visibility in this game has been greatly improved from launch. It's a positive change.
---
When I go on my smurf which is like level 20 under everyone tens kills and I hate it
---
Yeah. I always get kicked as soon as it gets to 1v anything. I really only play casual too if I dime have friends on st the time or one of my friends wants to. (I hate casual because of stuff like this so I only play ranked.) 
---
I've gotten up to 84%. With multiple wins.
---
I've played enough casual to know that the round would probably have taken the full time to finish. Console casual is very slow, people who don't know how to play the game or don't really take it seriously or whatever. And when you get spawn peeked by some try harded who's sitting running out on you when you're afk for the first 5 seconds in spawn, you can't be arsed waiting to watch someone take 3 minutes in a 1v4 to die in the first or second fight they get into.

No really I didn't know it was a free item. Wow what a revelation a pack you earn by waiting for spin wheel to bless you with a common is free. Wow. And also how come everyone I fucking talk to even myself always have to wait until we're above 50% or more to get a shitty pack? Also when they're cosmetic it shouldn't be a chance system nor should it be as pricey as it is to get a fucking rare from the shop. And no shit you earn renown but the amount you get is absolutely horrible. Especially when half the fucking crap in the game that's worth getting is above 25k renown which in fact can get you an operator itself. 
---
You are the dense one. Just because you will never get caught does not mean that it is right or not cheating. And yes, I have read the Ubisoft code of conduct, thank you very much. The fact is they have no way to enforce vans on the xim, but that doesn't make it any less of a cheat.

It's just a matter of skill and luck.  You can stand on the counter in the middle to pick it back up on that point, so you can definitely outplay Thatcher. 
---
 Keeping that hatch secured is huge, since it denies the attackers LOS on basically all of the front of that point.  They're left with trying to push meeting hatches (which isn't great, with the Mira there) or trying to push the front or back where there's a Mira watching them with (hopefully) her C4 not wasted. 
---
Lol, utter bs. You telling me that 95% of the time I play only ranked, both solo and with friends, have plat all the time, and it's not my actual rank because of some casual cesspit having 'different ranking system'?

If so, then why do I always completely demolish these silvers and low golds while high gold or plat plays decently if they happen to be matched with me?
---
I play from day one and casual (SI as well) has always been a mode where everyone plays with anyone. I even got matched with and against diamonds in casual.

2 V 4 and 3 of them decide to push ONE stair case , idiots smh , 
---
I assume that was a spider verse reference? Such a good movie!
---
I know but a random chance system is far worse from having a bar that fills up after you did something in a match. Even if you win or lose if you did well and say got 6 kills or more you get a decent percent of the bar completed because you did well. Not because oh you lost the match because your team guess what you get nothing asides 400 renown.
---
I really do just want a siege two at this point with a brand new engine made for siege. 
---
it's one of his grenade lines. Can't tell if it's the smoke grenade or frag grenade line. 
---
I'm starting to do it all the time now especially since I figured out how to record 1080p 60fps with no problems. But man it takes up 50 gb for one play session. GL HF in your next games
---
Right? Tired of all the toxicity. By the way can you help me complete a Ubisoft Challenge? 
---
This is one of my favorites tbh. I don't get the debate about whether a skin deserves to be legendary or not. I really don't know what people are expecting. 
---
SHHHHHHHH
---
I select my operator but as I‚Äôm loading in my game freezes/crashes. Could play fine yesterday. On PC by the way. 
---
That‚Äôs casual for you. 
---
Yeah Xbox casual is the worst, and I say that as an Xbox player. Ranked isn‚Äôt so bad on there but never play Casual. 
---
I've gotten the Ash headgear at uncommon the one that's blue and red I don't know the name of it because I don't like it but that head gear I've gotten like 8 times and sometimes twice in a row.
---
That's recruit straight booling on yatch
---
It's nothing to do with money lol. "I'll pay the game to fix its self". Negligence happens. Name one bugless game.
---
That's cool. Is it an alpha pack drop or can you just buy it? 
---
Eh its probably my favorite but that might just be because it was my first.
---
That's nice of
---
how would that work with alt+f4?
---
And I guarantee that neither of them thought after that kill ‚Äúhmm maybe we shouldn‚Äôt have all pushed one stair way‚Äù they probably blamed the sledge for not shooting lol  
---
I would encourage you to try this: pay close attention to Hibana's body, her head specifically. Wait for Blitz' shoulder pad to be in position, you'll see it then. From the angle where you were at I completely see what happened. You were standing, Blitz was crouched, Hibana was more or less flat with her head up slightly. You had to have been aiming at a downwards angle to shoot his shoulder pad, making it plausible, dare I say most probable that you were hitting Hibana's head.
---
And as far as the blood spraying goes, there are no odds to dwell on. Huge blood splatter has been in the game forever. Her head was literally behind Blitz' shoulder pad, obscured from view but if you had X-ray they would line up. If Blitz' shoulder pad had a hitbox, the blood splatter would look identical because like I said, Hibana's head and Blitz' shoulder pad are in perfect alignment.
---
And for the last time, (or maybe you didn't read everyone else's comments), you are not hitting Blitz in the shoulder. If you look at the red outline of his body behind the shield, right before the kill cam, you can clearly see that what you were shooting was not a part of his shoulder. It was the excessive padding. You can connect the lines on his red outline to form his hit box.
---
Nah Never Seen this before, what is it?

Im right there with you buddy 
---
I'm down, gamer tag: "Sarkono"
---
i got mine in an alpha pack but you can buy it too. go to the AR33‚Äôs skins and you‚Äôll see it.
---
The fps is really bad on PC. I have had 44fps solid and i'm dropping to 60fps a LOT.
---
Thanks for the help anyway, is there a formula you used to get those hipfire values?
---
Defense: lesion 
---
Attacking: Jackle
---
I never get anything but commons from packs

Don‚Äôt be a tard.

I honestly like both styles (crazy and plain/realistic) but this sub posting these circlejerky posts about skins not deserving to be legendary just because they're not covered in neon or something crazy is just dumb. Like, what are they expecting to be legendary?
---
R6 engagements are to close quarters and too fast for a complex ping system anyways. It works in a BR because you can spot someone and still not engage them for a long time.  Arma has a basic ping (if enabled) and it's fine. You still have a compass, room callouts, drone pings, etc... Why bother investing development time for a feature they don't even want to promote? Especially when there are still numerous glitches to be fixed.  
---
Ping is fine as it is, get a mic, use the callouts, play with friends. Game is doing fine without "innovation" through copying a new game.  
---
I have seen a teammate run-out trigger the claymore but killed the last guy before it went off. 
---
Blame the CSGO fanbase that branched out to siege
---
It's casual it doesn't count.
---
Just kidding, nice kill.
---
Not sure if ginger or redhead. Max effort for a profile pic though 
---
That‚Äôs where you‚Äôre wrong kiddo, a PS4 player isn‚Äôt intelligent enough to understand. Also it took you forever to respond with your slow ass PS4 reaction time.
---
Nothing at all
---
Play, multiplayer, create game. Not sure the exact steps but in the custom game settings there is an option for server location for dedicated servers and a whole host of options. You can basically make any game mode you want from PL settings to casual with insane round timers, turn on/off sprint or leaning, or just toggle on tactical realism. Experiment, have fun. 
---
You get to start again 
---
What‚Äôs the issue?
---
See why banning words can be a bad thing
---
Lol the Mira suggesting a Mirror.
---
Yeah man. I picked nomad about two weeks after launch and someone in a four stack messaged me saying ‚Äúpick her again you‚Äôre gone‚Äù and tked me. 
---
What exactly is the problem here? You just got fuzed, no?
---
what happened 
---
So I unplug my ethernet cable, you got code that know I unplugged my ethernet cable vs a legitimate internet drop? 
---
Freah start 
---
The emoji was for your post, not the comments. That I‚Äôm pretty sure was the first comment.
---
That's fun
---
I had a problem a few weeks ago where my frames would drop from 20-40 after a few games. Was a nvidia driver issue and I had to roll back my driver to the mid-summer driver.
---
Not really relevant to this issue, but it turns out Ubi is aware of this issue, they mentioned it on Twitter.
---
There's no sound on the cluster charge which is one of the loudest things in the gams
---
It‚Äôs not that they‚Äôre mad, it‚Äôs that they think it‚Äôs funny you worked so hard to win the round then get kicked
---
Weird flex but ok 
---
Ubi is aware, check twitter.
---
Thats a lol, how that even happened...
---
I think he likes kaid
---
Whats your next idea? Make a skill system that is implemented into casual that puts you into games based on your points or skill and you win more if you win games and lose points if you lose games.
---
Oh I didn‚Äôt have sound on. Understood now
---
I mean, Need For Speed and FIFA are built on Battlefield engine.
