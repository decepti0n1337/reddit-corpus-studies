In my opinion ubi need to fix what legendary items are
---
---
---
Don't bother. It's like casual hostage but sweatier.
---
Do they have a bosg, yeah that's what I thought...
---
What if they work the mask like Hibana? They are wearing the red outfit and the mask but you can still see their face. In the series they rarely ever put it on anyways.
---
Same situation. Plat II on Xbox, but silver on PC.
---
Good thing you can't even play casual games but the goddamn skinpack is here
---
Must be live footage of Kantoraketti before they nerfed him.

I dont mind 2 speeds getting acogs, Its realistic.
---
Imo y‚Äôall are ungrateful af even if it looks cooler than the base helmet skin
---
I like it, but I think there should have been a riot visor over the goggles, and add Mira‚Äôs military rank plated on the helmet.
---
Ok if u could change one thing about siege what would it be
---
Damn right
---
It's even worse IMO if you were to just play casual hostage. You're playing the same map (Bank) and defenders can choose site but a defender win doesn't even force them to go to another site next time they're defending... so basically you're playing Bank Vault 99% of the time because that's every solo person's 1st choice for Bank.
---
I get that that might fit the theme of the show (don't know anything about the show, maybe it's around stealing from a bank vault?) but holy fuck does it get stale even quicker than any other event they've done in the past.
---
She got clapitaod
---
I like how she got a picture of Nicolas Tesla on the wall.
---
Same. They seemed to assume I like blowing shit up. Not a bad guess, but I digress.
---
I made a post about this literally 3 days ago, basically sometimes I know 100% what is happening and I absolutely don't need callouts. Muting them is opening the scoreboard, finding who you need to mute, muting them etc. That's a lot of steps when you could just have a singular button to disable voice chat.
---
Hells yeah lol
---
Add all maps back in casual with night maps back too, thats the first thing
---
9/10 hitbox too large
---
$100 for all ops.
---
$40 for season pass.
---
Want skins? Earn them slow as fuck (or in some cases, ie this one, can‚Äôt earn them at all) or pay potentially hundreds.
---
Every 3 months, $50 skins event that at least has some cool gameplay (Valentines, Halloween, etc.)
---
An upcoming battlepass. (~$10-20)
---
And now this bullshit? An ‚Äúevent‚Äù that is just the arguably worst game mode with a hostage skin and two operators that you can choose have skins, all as an ad? Fuck that and fuck anyone (read: you) who defends it at this point.
---
&gt; so Ubi wouldn't really lose any money
---
I mean, you did just list the fact that boosters exist.
---
Yes it's not direct but there's no reason people get boosters other than to earn more credits for packs.
---
Let's say u could make ur own custom op what it be
---
They definitely didn't pay for licencing. It's an advertisement for the show, Ubi would have to be completely stupid to pay Netflix to advertise their show
---
I like it too it just should be an epic not legendary
---
Might be for the event
---
Yeah I like it to just make it epic not legendary tho
---
I would actually do challenges then, I haven't done challenges since I swapped from PS4 three years ago, I will only do ones for special event packs.
---
there is only uplay servers. steam opens up uplay.
---
The pro league sets and the new A Casa de Papel bundles are the same price (1512 R6 credits each)
---
So by this logic the Rainbow is Magic event isn‚Äôt an event it‚Äôs just hostage on plane with a reskin
---
The Outbreak outfits kind of did this and it was such an incredibly stupid decision by Ubi.
---
I mean they have to make some money out of it so that just isn't feasible but would be cool for a charm or something cool, but nope just both outfits cost like more than 10$ each
---
Thank you Bikini
---
Uhm I have some, but first why are you asking me lol? You from Ubisoft?
---
That looks amazing
---
A Doc and Twitch collab, possible subtle nod to a healing drone op?
---
Doesnt even pay more,why should i bother?
---
Its Just a skin and not even thematic since only two Op have
---
Maybe?
---
BOSG ACOG only
---
He recorded me and I said the aug a2
---
did he clap you
---
So yes?
---
What was the result?
---
Luckily he was on my team
---
3:1 to ya and he said he wasn‚Äôt trying at all though
---
I have 800 hours on siege and wanted to see what I got from the quiz. I‚Äôm a support main but I did use to main ash and jager when I first started
---
can't fire a C8 one handed...
---
It's the principle of it. You can ignore shit that you don't want but what happens when you do want those things, you've basically told ubi, "that's fine that you charge ridiculous prices for skins and no way to unlock them" "it's fine you have a battlepass and hide cosmetics behind a pay wall". It's just allowing companies to get away with shitty business practices.
---
Yes basically my job at ubi is to get peoples opinions on stuff
---
Operators for sure. 
---
People get bored of the events really fast, outbreak which was the bigger event, people got bored after a week ( and that‚Äôs generous) I don‚Äôt play siege for all the events, I play it for the more "realistic" aspect and for rank.
---
Same here, i usually play Zofia, IQ, Ela, Kaid
---
I know I loved it in DbD, so Chips Ahoy Smoke? Pretty please Ubi
---
I don't care about the magnitude, I didn't expect any special aplha packs, a dedicated map or whatever, but this can't be even called event. They offer you to play something you can play since the exinstence of this game and try to sell some very overpriced skins in the course of it.
---
You work for support ot what?
---
-some extra
---
Happy birthday to the clip!
---
You'd have glaz on defence then lol. Imagine trying to push a defender that can smoke push and have one way sight on you with an automatic weapon lol
---
You sound like a kid Who didn‚Äôt get exactly the toy he wanted. It‚Äôs not even fucking Xmas. It‚Äôs just another normal weekday.  
---
Did you pay for it? Were you forced to participate? Was there free skins?
---
Is this a direct buff or a passive buff
---
I mean,Glaz is ass so it‚Äôs correct.
---
Yeah. Making the same mistake twice is a great idea
---
I‚Äôm blind that why
---
should of been payday 2...
---
How is the new event
---
I got fuze jager
---
Idk man sounds pretty toxic
---
Thankfully it seems to be doing generally well without having become free.
---
this shit is fucked
---
5 bucks ‚Äúbucking‚Äù the map
---
no. dur
---
G
---
gross
---
Wait they have a new event? What is it?
---
I can‚Äôt check it for a couple days
---
This would be great, but the more realistic version would not be rare and above. Its rarity would be random or however it's determined when you roll for a pack.
---
The post it note under Tesla: 
---
‚ÄúShow Doc, drone improvement chip‚Äù üëÄ
---
Mute at 25 I believe.
---
what cunts
---
the "cav can't counter jackal" is the strangest myth honestly
---
literally anyone who's played cav against a jackal even once can tell you that's how it works, yet people still just keep saying it doesn't work like that for seemingly no reason
---
if i am right . Mute is the youngest
---
That was me, using headphones and a boom mic üòÖ
---
I played two games, it's just hostage on bank with skins, wasnt anything special for me but you should still try it out, you might like it!
---
It'd be nice if they had an operation with CTUs from previous games, like a 4E operator or classic R6 characters.
---
I'm guessing they got paid to do the marketing for the show on their game
---
Hell yeah!
---
Im not quite sure everybody is downvoting this. Its a fucking free event. Honestly feels like peoples only jobs are to complain about every minor fucking thing in a videogame.
---
Stop my penis can only get so erect
---
There is a game called Screen Peek, where all the players are invisible but you can see everyone else‚Äôs perspective. Interesting concept.
---
My team does the same thing with my frost mats weird
---
Love the cake enjoy the silver

What do you mean?

Toxic Jager ash mains
---
Why doesn't it make sense to have the competitive ranked mode set to bomb only? The operators and balancing decisions are made around bomb..
---
No you can't, the guy before you said that because castle is actually good, despite you not enjoying him. You can't just say that about someone like Amaru, Amaru is just useless, doesn't matter if u like playing her or not.
---
I saw terraria so your a man of culture as well
---
That's exactly the fucking point of renown, and **literally every other in-game "premium currency"**, saying that "there is no way to pay real money for alpha packs" is genuinely concerning, *are people this ignorant of the purpose of premium currency*?
---
nerf blitz
---
Jeez
---
Lol wtf
---
Yes. It's on a free weekend.
---
I would be highly insulted by their opinion I love to blow up attackers as Kapkan if it weren‚Äôt entirely accurate.
---
I felt this was inaccurate.
---
I forgot to mention cancer
---
I mean you came into a thread about Rainbow six and started calling it a dying game, what were you expecting? Agreement? All you've accomplished is making yourself look like a child by resorting to homophobic slurs lmao.
---
Next op doc twitch combo, its a drone that shoots heath.
---
I mean it is an event but you could  also use promotion or mini game
---
Now that's what I call edgy
---
I heard alt-f4 is the best op around for the job, you should try it
---
It costs literally 0 dollars to make a new account. And it won't be waisting anything cause you can always go back to your old acount as long as you have the password
---
So does that mean people can get the game for free or cheaper?
---
Fuze
---
Cheaper for 5 or so days
---
im not refering to the mission , im refering to the image in the painting , its bank.
---
When you somehow find maestro in your first mat
---
ase
---
It‚Äôs almost like they are a business and need to make money :0 crazy right
---
Are you confusing renown with r6 credits (the currency you pay real money for)? If so you still can't buy alpha packs with real money. Renown you get for playing and you can buy packs with that but you can't spend real money for packs.
---
Ubi wishes they made a mobile game.
---
Airjabs already effect attackers, it's just that a defender has to trigger it. That's probably what OP saw, instead of some strange role reversal.
---
And if you wouldn‚Äôt believe it, I‚Äôm in a game with a bunch of 12 year old screaming the n word in their mics right now. Deadass
---
Yes. Add it. ADD IT. I WILL KILL YOUR FAMILY IF YOU DONT ADD IT.  Just went to therapy, and now im not gonna kill your family, ima just gonna kill someone.
---
I mean, yeah, but you shouldn‚Äôt get renown while using an op you don‚Äôt have
---
Next sponsor should be Kool-Aid so they can give sledge a red suit and a glass pitcher for a head and when he breaks something with his hammer he says OH YEAH!!
---
I expect you whiny bitches to understand what that actually means instead of interpret it as ‚ÄúME HATE GAME BAD GAME‚Äù and screech autistically. You know, react how normal people do. You gay ass titty babies got all butthurt but couldn‚Äôt take it when I started firing back lmao. 
---
Reddit is such a fucking trash can. You need to get out more and quit being such a dense pussy.
---
I guess I didn't word myself properly. How does removing hostage from ranked and unranked make any improvements? Your point is valid, but they could just ignore it, after all it is an unbalanced game mode. Since Pro League and all the major stuff happen with bomb, besides the whole playerbase  just agreeing that bomb is the actual competitive mode of Siege, what does someone gain from ranking up through hostage? Just some meaningless charm, if ranked had a lot of rewards for  being diamond then sure, move it to unranked, but my point is that secure area and hostage should not be casual only, because casual in general sucks and unranked has better gameplay. So why not add it as an option to unranked? That is all I am saying
---
Thanks dude

true other than that though the idea seems pretty good tho

this is client side stuff where the player you're spectating see's a breached wall and your wall is still intact you probably joined an ongoing match mid round happens all the time

Wh-

[removed]
---
Shoulda just been payday in rainbow tbh
---
I can‚Äôt lie I really miss when the game was more exciting. Refused operator concepts are one problem, but for me the biggest thing that makes the game more boring than it used to be is the fact that the ranked map pool is very small. The old ranked was really fun, win or lose, because it played like ranked but with a lot of fun. New ranked is just a little too competitive you know? I‚Äôm a very competitive person but this game would be better with a lot more maps in ranked in my opinion.
---
Yes. Its the only game ive ever seen in console to have this option. 
---
I said fps boost because for some reason the T-hunt FPS are capped at 30, and when you disable vsync it goes up to 60, with some minimal drops in spawn areas.
---
The esports teams perform very well especially navi at the japan major and the APAC teams can barely afford to go full time pro due to pro league is looked down on there
---
pRo LeAuGe
---
Yes.
---
The Mask is more terrifying than vigil's normal mask.
---
Not really.
---
Compensator reduces horizontal spread and vertical climb, while flash hider only reduces vertical recoil, but reduces it more than the comp reduces the vertical. So if something has pretty much straight up and down recoil, you'll want to put FH on it, but if it's got large amounts of horizontal recoil, you'll want to use comp.
---
yea that‚Äôs facts
---
after seeing this i'm never gonna take being able to pick spawns in casual for granted
---
It just changes for me every day. Some days it really likes House, other days it really likes Tower, etc. Haven't had an Oregon heavy day in about a week now, but I get what you're saying.
---
Yes plz
---
Now i ship.
---
I only have 2 emails which are my main and my school so I don‚Äôt use a smurf account and my main email isn‚Äôt a fake.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs annoying how they push ranked to be so similar to pro league yet leave out a bunch of stuff from pl. mainly for time I think but it‚Äôs hard having pick and ban in a short-ish ranked mode.
---
Carrying a 92FS?
---
The Tesla picture is so prominent I'd almost start thinking that it's a hint at a future Serbian/Croatian operator.

Hahaha whaaaat bro no T-Hunt definitely has another reason
---

Almost nailed it.

You are right she should kill him instead
---
Fuck pengu for ruining someone's career cause he was better than him
---
Yeah I was pretty disappointed by the ‚Äúevent‚Äù but the skins are cool. I was thinking it would be like a bank robbery game mode or something cool like that.
---
i m fucking scared
---
Anyone else realize there are 5 vigils in the picture?  And saying he is one of them?
---
I dunno man, but this video really triggered me.
---
Yea because Pengu is the one that hands out bans, idiot. And just so you know almost every single pro team filed a protest against him it was just the Penta match that was the one that got him banned.
---
Put an ACOG on it
---
Holy shit lmao I thought it was just me that saw thst it cracked me up every time

more money != more content

This is a good idea since it helps you get something more than pointless ubi club xp, about 1000 renown at least, and some in game xp

This is one of the most garbage sponsored plugs I've ever seen.

I didnt mean that they would put the achievement in, simply that they could if they really wanted to. They've changed the achievements once already so they could technically add new ones that include new operators.

Op is so talented it's incredible!
---
It used to be a super rare skin as it was sold per weapon back in Y1S1 operation for like 15k renown (iirc). It was a flex status how you played early and got this really exclusive and rare seasonal skin that also just looks really beautiful.
---
Now it is not as rare since you can get it from alpha packs, but it still has that status symbol attached to it. It's just known as the most iconic skin in the game.

At best they make their money with renown boosters, yeah.
---
I never join reddit PL discussions but fuck me, do you even realise that shaiiko was cheating? It is not Pengu who got him banned, only person responsible for this is shaiiko himself ffs, and if you defend a cheater you should honestly just stop using internet and playing games. Im so disgusted by what you just said, defending a HACKER?? You must be out of your mind.
---
If I remember correctly it starts with the new season Y4S4.
---
Pacifist siege gameplays
---
This has been a weirdly great event despite bad servers and it just being hostage on bank.
---
1. Hostage is alot more fun than I remember.
---
2. This has convinced me that site voting and spawn voting should be in casual.  Randomized positioning means you can't strategize as a team to the same extent.  
---
3. Ubi should do one map events like this constantly, this has really helped my map knowledge on bank.
---
Was it an IQ test?
---
Well ubisoft has redeemed themselves over the years with their continuous post launch support for their multiplayer releases. Maybe they can become even more of a good guy and let this concept happen lmao.
---
they want us to be brainless form the beginning
---
Same if you play a bit more you get better and better.
---
Sometimes players join midgame too, it's pretty broken and has been for a long time.
---
Who's yandhi
---
In germany we call it 'ehre'.
---
its always either
---
one you dont own
---
if its the british ops, it will be on maps they're kinda meh on
---
if its fbi swat, you will always have to do it 8 times, and it has to be wins
---
if its gign, its going to be for terrorist hunt, where they dont really work
---
if its not any of these, the operator will be picked before you click it
---
I mean, apart from it being a matte disk it doesn't really match.
---
It doesn't suck in grenades, it attracts more than just grenades. You made no mention of it being magnetic. You suggested 3 charges whereas the actual thing has more and generates them throughout the round. You implied that it does prevent frag grenades from going off whereas the actual thing doesn't.
---
You basically suggested something like Jager and Ubi made something like him, not a shock given that operator bans recently became a thing in ranked.
---
Recruit is an operator and don't you forget it.
---
They should implement that and more. The current alpha pack system is downright abysmal. But besides a complete rework, this and a higher amount of renown given for duplicates would go a long way.

I really fucking can‚Äôt get rid of this rash I have on my inner thigh it burns and doesn‚Äôt go away no matter how much aloe vera I put on it.
---
You should get an alpha pack every level up
---
I don‚Äôt think anyone has currect
---
Could search it up and find in \~a minute, but here you go.

---
So who have the best hs rate in the league?
---
Literally just a few weeks ago, at the Ubi shareholder meeting, they announced the Halloween event was the most profitable ever. 
---
Is anyone surprised they scrambled to shoe horn in a new event that basically took zero thought or effort? I'm not. After that meeting I expected this.
---
the goal of ranked is to have to teams compete for victory
---
if a team wants to waste their ban on the new ops for no strategic reason that's not something you can really complain about, because while the other team(if your team is banning the ops you really got to get a stack) is banning out of baseless fear, you can take avantage of the situation by banning what you want without having to worry about your strats getting banned cuz the new ops havent settled into the meta yet. 
---
also everytime a new season releases, normally everything is a shitshow with new blood figuring everything out, pros grinding for their rank, and hackers(havent seen this much and I think ubi fixed it for the most part) so ban freezing those ops would likely extend the shitshow longer
---
that's not it at all, I meant the event's soundtrack...
---
Me too... been playing for a while tho.
---
Mate don't even try, people like him aren't gonna change their minds.
---
There is a hidden MMR system on casual and is trash and doesn't work, the end. Someday ubi will do something about it.
---
Understandable, have a nice day.
---
Also thatcher what if he becomes too old to fight?
---
After he lost his ACOG he started over and this is what he has become
---
I think it‚Äôs just the main theme of the Netflix Series.
---
oh, sorry..
---
Jackal has 7 technically hahaha
---
Lol
---
I agree, but unfortunately I highly doubt that Ubi will actually fix her smg. The horizontal recoil is so fucking bad, not even real life weapons have that much horizontal recoil. Ela's smg at certain point goes like fucking 3 cm to the left or right and vice versa. You can hit anything with this gun unless you literally shove the gun into somebody's ass.
---
She wasn't balanced out, she was over nerfed to the point she's just not worth to pick anymore VS all the other operators available. Why to even deal with this fucking bullshit when you can just pick somebody else? To me, if they keep her as she is now, they can take her out of the game all together because I'm not gonna play her in the current state. Now they nerf her shotgun? The only reason I rearly picked her? Fucking radicolous.
---
Same thing with Jackal. He was good until Pick and Ban came. Also I think pick and ban failed completly and it should be removed
---
I used to think that until people started following me around online and harassing me. Not Siege, but never underestimate Gamers' capacity to be a total tosspot
---
I missed the montly repost of a bundle that has been since Y1S2...
---
Hello all, thank you so much for the support and the feedback, I am currently building the maps on a singleplayer world with multiple other maps completed including skyscraper, Hereford Base, Outback, Yacht and soon to be coastline.  I intend to make all rainbow six siege maps on this world, but if yall want the download now, I can post a copy of the world file. Thank you.
---
its still rng
---
I tried searching for a ranked  match for like 30 mins before closing app and restarting again and when I tried searching again it said your in a ongoing match. But when I tried reconnecting I never got in I waited for 20 mins. Haven‚Äôt been on since but I hope i don‚Äôt get a penalty
---
The multiplayer is a training simulation. It‚Äôs not real.
---
Interesting idea, but until this thread gains traction and Ubi's community managers see it, it can only be an unverified rumor.
---
No bipod on knife? Not interested.
---
Ranks are fun but make no fucking sense whatsoever in this game. I'm Plat and some of my friends which are better than me end up Silver; one of my friends that is total garbage after 100 games he's still in Gold while this other guy who mostly carried him and plays 10 times better fell in Bronze after over 300 matches. It makes no sense to me how this rank system works.
---
 I wanna add also it's full of smurfs which ruin the fun/experience, I always joke that it's a gamble "ok which team gets the smurf guy and wins this match?". Many games feel terribly one sided, which makes the 3 rounds on attack thing only add more salt to the wound. Also what I realised is this game doesn't reward you at all for playing good, imagine you played exceptional one game but just as usual we got disconnected teammates, trolls or just idiotic matchup with level 40 players, and you got like 13 kills and lose, WELL fuck you and your performance Ubi ain't give a shit u still lose just as many points.
---
For over a week now 1 out of 3 games we play with one missing team mate, idk they keep crashing or something, I get a lot of game crashes too it's really frustrating. 
---
Playing this game with premade mates is way better.
---
This doesn't even make sense... John Clark was Six during the beginning of Operation Rainbow. Domingo "Ding" Chavez was one of the Team Leads. If the timeline of the book (post-Clancy) is followed, then Jack Ryan is still president, John Clark is 68 years old and Domingo Chavez is still active as a member of The Campus (inofficial intelligence group).   
---
Ubisoft has never acknowledged Clark and Chavez existing after the first few games... so there is little hope that Ubisoft will somehow combine Siege with the official book timeline. The Amazon Show has a big problem as it shows Jack Ryan as the guy that can handle fights... but in the books, Clark has always been the "dark" mirror to Jack Ryan... he was always the guy handling the darker and more extreme tasks while Jack was the thinker...   
---
I am currently reading "Without Remorse" again, the origin story of John Clark... such a crazy good story which Ubisoft never mentioned in their game. Especially when following up "Without Remorse" with "Rainbow Six", then the whole Operation Rainbow story becomes complete and shows how integral Clark and Chavez were to the inception of the Team... 
---
Why not create an event against an overpowering enemy, John Clark and Domingo Chavez show up. Clark is the adviser and tactician, while Chavez is the Team Lead, filling his old role once again... Yeah... dreams.
---
But then why are they able to die
---
Did he get nerfed?
---
I want to fuck twitch
---
Your profile picture does make you look like someone who'll sell bathwater, so I presume that's why he called you a THOT.
---
Also, I don't see how people watching your stream is easier than connecting with people in-game and have them teach you - making your post look like advertising.
---
Wait so you bought r6 credits, then used them, then asked for a refund? Ngl bro that‚Äôs kinda scummy.
---
I was a bit disappointed by that change. It takes zero effort to get all achievements now.
---
I haven't played this game in a while. What the fuck is that gadget?
---
Too bad Ubisoft doesn't listen... Look at what they did to my girl Ela...
---
Damn dude, you got the same taste as I do. I love vintage, rustic type looking skins
---
That's sick af
---
No, I don't know if you have any notion of statistics, but we're way past the point of statistical significance
---
Yeah, obviously I haven't seen the matchmaking algorithm, but from my experience it seems like it could be true. I have 9 ping and almost always start on attack too
---
its still rng, mad cuz bad
---
Especially if it's John Krasinski's likeness
---
They deserved to get belittled in this post tbh.
---
But still you wrote "EZ"
---
Some show... please go watch it. It‚Äôs called money heist and it‚Äôs amazing
---
So Netflix show tie ins and Halloween events are fine, don't break story at all. Someone wants Jack Ryan in the game "think of the canon!" Lol ok
---
So you even admit the other events are good. But this one isn't as good so every entitled brat moans yet again. Jesus fucking Christ, this kinda shit makes them stop releasing because sad cunts just jump all over it even though it's free and has no effect on the base game whatsoever
---
H E L L  Y E A H
---
It was done on your account, so your account got punished
---
Ooh it‚Äôll sting a lot!!
---
Is this a teaser for payday 3 or something
---
hoes mad
---
Ubisoft need to make profits on this game to secure its continued development so personally I am fine with in game cosmetic which are R6 credits only. What is rather eye rolling is how they have used every single monetisation tactic in this game. Most games stick to just one or two. 
---
1. Multiple versions of games with different pricing.
---
2. Real money only cosmetics
---
3. Long grind for new OPs when using in game currency
---
4. Yearly pass
---
5. Soon to release battle pass
---
Before people start saying the grind for OPs is not bad, consider the people who don't play for 3 hours per day. The 25,000 renown for new OPs takes a long time and this is to incentivise real money spending. 
---
Anyway I love this game and all of the above is totally optional so I'm not actually salty over it. Ubisoft are gonna Ubisoft.
---
Im level 84 and dont have a single black ice D:
---
Oh I see, it‚Äôs one of the only good pictures I have of myself as I never really take pictures so that‚Äôs why I chose that one lol. I don‚Äôt connect with people in-game because as soon as I use my mic I get vote kicked or harassed for being a lass and if I am playing ranked I get vote kicked for being low level so I thought maybe I could ask here! But I get it so that‚Äôs why I removed the link haha
---
I have a low ping and so do my teammates but I'm thinking it could be more related to the fact that we're a 5 stack, with the matchmaking filling the attacking side first, and it's easier to fill when there is a 5 stack.
---
When we're not a 5 stack we start more often on defense (though that could also be because teammates ping are different)
---
Very desirable. Very necessary.
---
Could be true as well, though I usually only play with one other guy
---
The event is just hostage with some spice on vigil and hibana
---
this is just a gamemode not an "event"\^\^
---
Ok, I thought we were having a serious conversation, clearly, that's not the case. You can keep on rambling/using tired all memes.
---
I won't buy these skins but I do own most of the elite skins. I'll never understand why people whine about other people buying cosmetics. Dont want to buy it or think it's stupid? Cool, keep Your money and quit your pussyaching about what other people spend their money on.
---
why is there a video of a white screen?
---
Been experiencing the same thing when I 5 stack.
---
Should only be for some of the handguns such as the 1911 that the Americans have (or at least most of them) as well as the more large weapons such as the usp.40 the smaller ones I think are ok with how they look
---
Lol amaru and glaz as an essential operator. Good joke. Glaz has an even LOWER pick rate than amaru
---
It‚Äôs the event mode.
---
lol this event isn't even on the scale of outbreak or other events and wasnt even promised to be so.Stop biching and acting entitled with these stupid post
---
Event mode
---
But he gains them over time and Jager is also able to stop 6 grenades
---
yeah, it's existence seemed to be a trial for Quarantine, but I had a blast playing it.
---
Oh okay, thanks for the answer :)
---
Wouldn't be much of a simulation if they didn't
---
Yeah but the way his gadget is used kinds makes the projectiles work against the attackers
---
Well, we dont have campaign or lore-based events so, honestly there is no "story of the game" just 2 new bios every 3 months...
---
This!
---
You Go from 12-2 to 0-4 in a matter of seconds
---
Ditto. I don't play games to deal with toxic people. I play to have an enjoyable match. Like if a team is short from people leaving and you roll them. The correct response is not ez, but sorry for your leaver
---
Nice another MP5 user.
---
Why where what
---
Wait! The game has a story?!!!
---
Dont worry, my KD is worse and I've been playing for almost a year
---
Much better than the sellout skins

Nice aim you got there

Hello Crispy_Bacon21, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/dziggx/can_someone_help_me_with_this_connection_glitch/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Wait for it to copy too
---
Ok spiderman
---
Ok.
---
I mean you get a headgear every season for 5000 renown
---
This could be a lead up to a new CGI short
---
I will get it
---
Can we get an F in the chat?
---
Cucussions made me giggle
---
That does make sense, but he's also similar to lesion where he needs to stay alive to get the most out of him, if you kill him early in the round right now that already makes him worse than Jager 
---
If he receives any nerfs there might not be any good reason to bring him over Jager 
---
I suppose we'll just have to wait and see how he plays out once the season is completely released
---
And they look pretty good from what I‚Äôve seen, I‚Äôm not gonna play it and probably just open a pack but it will likely mean better ltms at a later date
---
But im entitled to have the devs work and fix the game to my every want and need /s

One thing I am not gonna miss about high-school.

School started at 7:20, my bus came at 6:15.

My alarms were set at 4:50 and 5:40.

Now, for college, I have my 8am class on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and then for the rest of the week they're 9am classes.

Also I've still got 2 weeks of summer vacation left. :D
---
It's big rush time.
---
But I mean one pro league set isn't enough I mean Alibi is a newer character and she already has had a  pro league set as well as event costumes I dont think Zofia has has any special/cool looking skin for any event And Why even mention her legendary gear you can get through alpha packs. My  chances of getting it is kad low anyways
---
nice :)

Launch T hunt and die fast

As someone who has paid a grand total of $10 on this game I would quite like more free stuff.
---
Time is ur best bet keep at it but don just go in blindly. Try droning a bit moar, holding angles instead of just peeking, and try to get info before u do something say peek an enemy or attempting a run out say. I've been at this shit for 4 years now and well I just hit plat.

I wasn‚Äôt saying R6 isn‚Äôt a buggy game. I said your death in this clip wasn‚Äôt a bug/bad hit reg. 
---
Ela‚Äôs shit recoil got her a lucky wall bang on you. She aimed at your ass as you run away from the door, her recoil goes up and to the left, far enough to shoot through the soft wall before she corrects her bad aim back at the doorway and fires again. That final bullet before she corrects her aim back at the doorway went through the wall to kill you. I can see why at first glance you‚Äôd think it was bad hit reg at the doorway, but watching the clip closely you can what actually happened.
---
Why is the hostage red?

YOU FOOKING MUPPET!!

Where did you read this?

 I dont understand what these events are if they are going to make them so shabby

His wrist wouldn't be "fucked" it would be just fine. He wouldn't hit much.

Correct.
---
You went to sleep and this option wasn't there. 
---
You woke up and it was.
---
It doesn't affect the main game in anyway.
---
There are new ops and map rework incoming. None of which costs you a thing. How about if they never released any events? 
---
You really think ubi devs are going to read your moaning and run back to their boss and say SHIT WE NEED A WHOLE NEW EVENT!!!!111ONE11?
---
If you do that I'll take- 
---
ugh-
---
I'll take your ACOG away entirely!!
---
Does that shield have a real light in front?
---
No it wouldn‚Äôt. Have you ever shot anything full auto? What about standing? Or one handed?
---
–î–∞
---
No ela just got her fo-12 nerfed and 4 gud reason
---
shoot the hostage
---
Yeah the shield lights up!
---
I'm just using it as an example I don't know what's happening with the battlepass. There is going to be a premium version which mostly likely locks consmetics behind a pay wall which blows because then if you want any of the cosmetics you'd have to buy the pass. I also have a right complain about dumb shit ubi does. I'll complain AND pass on overpriced bs.
---
The virgin rainbow six cast vs the chad warden
---
It's on the siege website
---
Nah id rather she got her scorpion buffed by removing some of the horizontal recoil. Maybe give it a little bit more damage at the cost of a smaller mag size as well.
---
I know I'm just surprised
---
He is too bad on controller he feels the need to cheat and post in on reddit, sigh
---
The new CTU (or more like private military) being introduced with season 4.
---
Such a dumb line. "Muppet" is just not a word that is generally used seriously and certainly not by an angry policewoman in a combat situation.  So that's not great writing. The voice actress does a decent job considering she's Canadian, apart from the awful way she pronounces "twat" (was there no one British at hand who could do the lines or at least check the pronunciation?)
---
It's the –õ–û–†–î checking your account

Great idea! What CTU is he?
---
It will be available for a year
---
Oregon would be so difficult to rework because there's not just one or two bad locations. The problem with it is that it's too linear. There's really only one (maybe 2 with a really really competent team) way to take each site. They would need to redesign pretty much the entire map, while other reworks only required changes to a couple areas.
---
The last time I downloaded it from steam it had like 70gb
---
I want the former Rainbow Six operator like Ding Chavez, Annila Lofquist, Daniel Bogart
---
Yeah I know; I'm British. It's really uncommon to hear it meant seriously though
---
Same. I‚Äôm on a plat streak now and it‚Äôs quite satisfying.
---
Well even if you know your shit you would have a hard time hitting anything over 15 meters.
---
Her ability is meant to stop you from doing that....
---
i placed gold 3 this time. who needs callouts
---
Realy nice, cuz i dont have any money atm
---
Same thought, she probably beat protesters too in her lore
---
I wonder how long is it going to take before ubi removes it for "balancing reasons"
---
Why is this so good
---
talking without the 4k texture pack and after Ubi had compressed the game differently,but yes it was around 70gb before wind bastion iirc
---
Idk the exact date, it was late Y1S3 though and my friends convinced me to buy it. I even told them "I'll hate Rainbow, I'll die too quick and feel like I had no say in the matter." How times have changed.
---
Shooting one handed with the gun braced against a window or door of a truck is different than shooting one handed while off balance with a full auto SMG that weights around 6.5 lbs. You wont break you wrist, but could still hurt it from firing at a wonky angle.
---
Arturitooooooooooooo
---
if you want to really be confused, read his bio in the game
---
i think they were planning a scifi expansion or something
---
I also got Thermite and Pulse...They are my least played attacker and defender.
---
Plat 3 is all... acceptable aim, no brain. 3800ish+ is where players start getting good and predictable, but challenging.

Kini exists in the Ubisoft cinematic universe.
---
Laurence Fishburne was so inspired by this dodge, that he told his friend Lilly Wachowski to watch this replay and this is what inspired her to make the Matrix movies. The trilogy almost didn't make it to production because her sister Lana was a Dokkaebi main.
---
Upvote this post so more ppl can see
---
What are you trying to say here?
---
Yeah nice clutch in copper
---
Kali i just wanna eat your pussy from the back
---
What is Leonardo DiCaprio doing there?
---
He will retire to his boat
---
A two speed operator could not have ran through the corridor into the cockpit and shot her within the two seconds left of the interogation animation
---
It's not straight blowback or open bolt like a lot of SMGs, the roller delayed blowback on the MP5 makes it very very smooth shooting from what I hear.
---
What at all made you think that?
---
I said in my very first comment that you shouldn‚Äôt main anyone. Every operator is situational to a degree. Being flexible is a positive attribute
---
Personally, I don't like it, but not because I think it's "OP" or whatever.  Kali is not overpowered, and I like that.  I wanted a sniper operator, too, but being a Glaz main since year 2, you can already guess what I'm about to say.  We already had one.  I feel like Kali is nothing more than a cash grab and I'll tell you why.  If you think about it, Kali is just Year One Glaz with a different skin, being marketed as a "new" operator.  Content that was previously free, Glaz, is now going to cost 25k renown or $5 USD.  
---
Let me explain:
---
Glaz originally had a much slower fire rate, no thermal, more recoil, but had 140 damage, so essentially a one shot.  Ubi then gave him the thermal scope.  Next update, the OTs is reworked to the one we know today, around 70-80 damage, thermal, and a slightly faster fire rate.
---
Lots of changes were made after that, specifically more damage nerfs, and I think a fire rate nerf.
---
Then we get to last season's Glaz, which is the reworked thermal scope OTs.
---
The reasoning for the thermal rework was, quote "We want glaz to fit his original role as a sniper, rather than an entry fragger" and you can find this on video if you look at the patch notes video for the Lion and Glaz reworks a few months ago.
---
This change *killed* Glaz, so Ubi buffed him by giving him a ridiculous fire rate, which goes *against* their reasoning for the thermal scope rework. 
---
Now I heard glaz is getting his old infinite thermal scope back, but...wait a minute.  Didn't they say they *didn't* want him to be an entry fragger?
---
There's been a bolt-action in the files for quite some time so I think to myself "maybe they'll give Glaz this, it only makes sense given the past changes to Glaz and what they said about it in the patch notes video."
---
Then they release Kali.  Kali gets the bolt action, so Kali is the "sniper operator."  "But wait a sec", you may think to yourself.  "Isn't Glaz supposed to be a sniper?"  Yes, he is.
---
If they wanted a sniper, they could've very easily reverted Glaz back to Year 1 form, or at the very least given him the bolt action instead.  But no, that wouldn't make them money would it?  So instead of giving Glaz the bolt action like they *should have*, considering Glaz is the game's sniper operator, they introduced a *new* sniper operator to fill Glaz's intended role, rather than just fixing Glaz.  So now Glaz stays an entry fragger, which is exactly what they *didn't* want, according to the patch notes video, and now we have a new sniper operator, when we already had one that needed fixing.  This shows they basically gave up on Glaz, and this shows they truly do not care about the operator anymore.  This to me, just seems like a cash grab, because we already had a sniper, we didn't need a new one, we just needed Ubi to fix it, but they didn't, they just made a new one instead.
---
-A pissed off Glaz main(since Year 2)
---
I usually main Doki but I do have a few elite skins, and alot of gun camos that's my main loss. Other than that I'm not loosing much overall since attachments and such ate free now
---
I think she's balanced, I don't like her for other reasons
---
People are actually saying she's OP?  I don't understand this, could you please explain?
---
Gotta keep the juices marinating
---
Nice job! Just like the guy in Hacksaw Ridge.
---
huh?
---
How many miles of internal wiring?
---
That's stupid though, that would just make her useless
---
No they‚Äôre not trained to shoot like that. I was in a heavy armor unit in the US Army for 5 years. I was a tank mechanic. Tankers are not taught to shoot one handed. Ever. Your spewing bullshit.
---
So he just wears a wetsuit everywhere
---
I think it's fine, honestly
---
And the one time they communicate, ‚ÄúHE‚ÄôS OVER THERE!‚Äù
---
r/perfectlycutscreams
---
Hahahaha
---
good argument, i liked all the points you brought to the debate to argue my points.
---
Real quick can someone elaborate what she does? I can still hear my footsteps when I use it so I guess she's not silent. Is she really just attack vigil?
---
Yes that is all true but Kali‚Äôs gadget allows her to play different from year one glad allowing her to make long range sightlines into objective even through electrified reinforcements
---
I can honestly care less about karma. I found this picture on one of their videos and thought it would be cool to share on reddit.
---
Well if I find a character more fun then all the others on a role I would rather play that then other characters most of the time
---
If you actually think this mnk, you're a damn fool.
---
So I'm abroad and out of the loop. Are the new operators any good? I should have them available when I'm back online.
---
Like the idea, but I feel like the flashbang idea is a little much.
---
I thought this was Lesion
---
Some pro players have said her gadget is as broken as lion at launch (Idk how they got to that conclusion) because of her gun being a one shot and her gadget being versatile 
---
While other pros like pengu think she's not OP
---
You can choose to nitpick and take what I said out of context, or move on. Already went throught this with someone else. Try reading the other comments.
---
what did they do?
---
After saving the hostage you are filled with determination
---
&gt;WHAT?!
---
Yeah, Alibi is just better for intel, man.  Alibi has better guns, too.
---
You'd be crazy to suggest that Ela's better.  The only reason alibi isn't used is cuz "sHe'S fOr TrIcKiNg" and no one uses her damn gadget the right way (thanks BikiniBodhi)
---
If only they listened to their playerbase, I, like many other Ela players have had the final straw, a 9th nerf. No buffs at all, and they left her completely broken now, she was my favourite character in the Siege universe, a rebel, the blacksheep of the family, an artist, an "efficient" killer. She's nothing now. She should just be removed entirely. Is there no way to talk to Ubisoft? If we can get a ton of people to bust their balls I think we might be able to do something, but I don't know. The recent nerfs are proof that Ubisoft are so disconnected from their community, and only listen to their diamond tier players.
---
Cool idea, but I‚Äôd rather have a full polymer or wood stock for MTS rather than a pistol grip looking one
---

I got the same two but idk how. I HATE pulse. I never use him and thermite is just generic. I use hibana so she's better for me then thermite
---
If only there was a story mode for this game
---
&gt; Ranked - smurfs 
---
LoL
---
NO we are not starting one of these stupid ass things again
---
&gt;because of her gun being a one shot 
---
See, this is what I don't get about game communities.  Players, no matter what game it is, always fixate on *damage* like it's the only stat that matters.  There's also bullet trails, recoil, fire rate, etc, tons of other factors.  
---
Her gadget, while versatile, is in no way broken, or even *close* to Lion on launch.  Lion was the single most busted operator this game's ever seen, I'd even go as far as to say he was worse than pre-nerf Blackbeard in terms of how stupidly overpowered he was.
---
Hopefully Kali doesn't get nerfed
---
Vigil dance party 1.0
---
The ez ruined it tbh
---
Mics only - ranked 
---
I would only play that
---
With leonardo Dicaprio standing over him
---
Yet many many people are against this nerf.  Like you she's my favorite character. But this 9th nerf will make her completely useless in every way imaginable. I'm not saying ubi should listen to the community. Every time they do something gets screwed up, same goes for when they don't. Because the only community they listen to is pro players and plat and above pc players. It's pathetic how disconnected they are.
---
It seems like they will be using 3, I cant confirm maybe when its doen
---
Why is this uploaded again?
---
Apart from the fact that Alibi is Italian..... this is kinda cool
---
Kali can allow for some alternatives to thatcher, while being a very strong post-plant op, being able to cover it from a distance, similar to what Glaz did in Year 3's infamous Glaz/Ying/Monty combo
---
I see a lot of potential for bundles hahaha
---
My fav design is the far right one on the bottom line (so tacticool)
---
All I want to see is the clip of the guy killing tking Buck and wondering how there were two Frosts.
---
It's not shameless to share a video that is similiar, just as the OP has done. I remember being human and being cool with the boys. You act like I'm some sinner for leaving a link.. Shame shame shame. That's the real shame for you to judge me that way. Leave your nasty attitude at the door. Goodnight!
---
I think you misspelled calculated
---
Could say the same about Aprils Fools event lmao
---
I'd fuck a drone
---
The bottom right one has a moustache.
---
I think even the smaller ones look kind of silly with it. The PMM, for example, has this really unique design that is just offset with the addition of a big bulky muzzle break sticking out at the end of it. Just my opinion.
---
No one is mad....
---
&gt; Ive been playing since year 2, so you can spare me the lecture about what you think the game is about. 
---
&gt; And you also dont seem to understand the concept of trying to capture market share. Again, I didnt say they were trying to be like fortnight, they want to get the prepubescent kids playing Siege instead, and then Ubi gets the money that was going to go to fortnight. 
---
&gt; Calling Siege realistic, the way it is today, is fucking laughable.
---
You seem mad, I don't know man, that's some stuff I would write if I were mad
---
I won't talk about fortnite either as I've never played it
---
I'm not psychoanalizing you. Just telling you to chill down and come here to chill, eat and drink....
---
I won't talk about games man. I'm just wishing you a nice day, and to play what you want.
---
lmao it literally says House Of Paper.
---
He never had a chance
---
THE CHAIR!!
---
They're made by our team's very own mega-talented artists.
---
Get pacifisted
---
I didn't think shitty poses could get worse than holding a gun on its side.
---
I see I was wrong.
---
Holy fucking balls this is a great idea.
---
Also can they please make it so I don't have to manually accept the fucking club challenges? Why the fuck would I ever *not* want to have one, even if I don't actively work towards it? The amount of times I've realized to myself, "man I've gotten plenty of kills, I wonder if I have gotten enough for that challen- oh wait I didn't accept it", and then all that work ends up going to waste. The most non-user-friendly thing of all time.
---
But why would they need to defend the bomb if they would be attacking for real?
---
I'm fairly certain it would be required... I need Xbox Gold to partake in any game's free weekend. Since you are still technically using PS internet service it makes sense...
---
Bulli
---
Yeah, I'm not saying every pistol should get a muzzle break, what I'm saying is that when one chooses to go into the menu and select muzzle break, the gun should get the stats but their should be no physical attachment to be seen. A lot of people will think that's odd so my other idea was to at least overhaul the visuals entirely. The pistols just look so much cleaner without muzzle breaks on them, but NOT using them isn't an option really.
---
They're mostly available for new ops since we started creating them not too long ago, but with the love we've seen for them, we're trying to work our way back through the older operators :D
---
HOLY SHIT I might be onto something here. Chell from portal 1 also had that! Can they be the same person?
---
Actually not a bad idea, althoughI am assuming he can detonate them individually.
---
It's a metaphorical example for next year's fiscal policy.
---
I havent worked for marketing in my entire life but I think we can all agree when I say this is just a collab between Netflix and Ubi for future projects thats all, anyone thinking otherwise needs to wake up.
---
Wait it's at least 5x?  That's cool, I like that.  But isn't the flip sight kinda the same thing?  I mean I don't see anyone using it, everyone just keeps the scope up
---
Again, u don't have to buy it. Vote with your pocket, it's basic rule.
---
I mean it wouldn‚Äôt be called headgear if she is still bald lmao
---
?
---
Glad isn't 12x, isn't it 2.5 like an ACOG?
---
2 and 5 are cool as heck.
---
I like it
---
That‚Äôs my boy
---
I like it but how the device is detected by operators other than iq should be tweaked a bit
---
Well it is meant for 5 people originally so
---
Yeah, what's really the good of having challenges not accepted?
---
Wamai looks like the Chad from the Chad Vs virgin meme
---
Blackops 4 didn't require PS+ for their free weekend. Seems Siege does, so "Enjoy the full game for free" is actually just "Download 60 gigs to play Situations". Seems pretty stupid you can't find this information anywhere.
---
oh fuck oh no
---
&gt;pretty lucky
---
did you sell your soul to the Siege gods for this?
---
I don‚Äôt think siege deserves it.
---
Maybe make sound just like mozzie pests do?
---
No
---
I don't know how to respond to this  comment
---
this would make teamkilling even worse than it already is, even if it causes accidental ones.
---
I was being sarcastic, Kali can zoom in too either 12x or 16x I forget.
---
I'm actually furious with that Hibana's lack of reaction
---
Same, guess I need to play Jager.
---
Look online July was it's biggest month ever
---
The show is soooo great cant wait for the next season
---
When she gets the MP7
---
This is so cool! I‚Äôm pretty excited!
---
Sweet my dudes, thanks for this \^\^
---
The lamp looks so good

XBOX ALERT

Just shoot a hole before you reinforce/mirror.  This will also allow sound to travel through the wall/mirror.  Problem solved

A video game, so far, has centered around depicting real-world military units their unique attributes and backgrounds. Sure the gadgets have gotten a little bit cartoony over the years but the game has done a good job researching real-world units and incorporating them into the games lore. I think players from India have every right to be mad that the devs just pulled this nonsense out of their ass. Not to mention the completely world-breaking fact that a PMC doesn‚Äôt represent a country, only it‚Äôs own financial gains, and Rainbow is supposed to be a multi-national CTU composed of operates from a bunch of a different *countries.* Literally the name ‚ÄúRainbow‚Äù is mean to state that the unit represents the colors of all nation‚Äôs flags and their solidarity while fighting terrorism. PMC‚Äôs don‚Äôt have flags. Kali‚Äôs entire back story is ‚ÄúRich woman gets what she wants because money.‚Äù
---
Well played man. The ace steal by that TK though, feels bad.
---
yes
---
Yeah crouching rapidly would be a pain. But I have a few friends who know special forces people and they've been on CTU's and stuff. And going to a practice range and setting up scenarios, one of the guys is definitely able to lean spam like that. And he's actually really flicky. He can come to a T intersection and peek left and right and hit 2 targets on each side in less than half a second. It's nuts.
---
Great concept!

*Your post has* ***not*** *been removed from /r/Rainbow6.*
---
It‚Äôs a very creative concept but I don‚Äôt really see them adding anything like that, it doesn‚Äôt quite fit in siege
---
Afrikan Kommando style shooting smh
---
Awaken my master
---
It‚Äôs causal. It doesn‚Äôt count
---
Agreed
---
I love siege hope I win!
---
I hope I'll win this giveaway. Those merchs are really amazing, also good luck to all the participants
---
That literally doesn‚Äôt fucking matter. Tons of guns in the game for CTUs that don‚Äôt use them irl.
---
How tf does this comply with Rule 1? This could have been any other game
---
Im not wasting my time with this.
---
Lol glad to see Rainbow 6 has gone from being about Counter-Terrorism to being a bad rip-off of James Bond, multi-ethnic gun-toting women in black dresses included. This would be palatable if she was at least wearing her tactical kit.
---
Sounds really cool but I don‚Äôt like 4 of the 5 notes underneath the pics. It shouldn‚Äôt be able to discharge other player‚Äôs gadgets. And it definitely shouldn‚Äôt take 3 seconds to remove - 1 second max. Team kills should count towards the defender that used the parasite. The 4th bullet point about sound is the only good idea imo
---
What about the Keratos? I have a Chiapa Rhino it's literally the easiest gun to shoot one handed. The only thing to that might be annoying is that it's single action, .357 isn't a wrist breaker.
---
Especially if she knows how to turtle back. That stray gets me a 3k in the right situation. Trick is to know you‚Äôre opponent and change the timings on it.
---
Gotta out run the lion some how
---
You don‚Äôt get the lava skin that was a preorder bonus for the pass.
---
But you can‚Äôt run, you will be slower than with a gu mine and you will make a lot of noise and you won‚Äôt be able to defend yourself. This is just a bad idea all around.
---
Lmfao that R6 is a nominee for it's community support, but not as an esport.
---
I really like vigil and maestro because the K1A is really easy to use does high damage with low recoil and maestros lmg is just insane+his shotgun pistol that you can use to create as many rotate holes as you want.
---
What a weird change
---
One word. Turtle back. I‚Äôm a gold II clash main and it‚Äôs only my second season. Mostly playing plats as my squad is mostly gold 1 and plat
---
Who is a bikini
---
Last post was removed, so I had to change title and flair
---
Agreed. Hold the flank until they all die, then 1vX clutch.
---
She‚Äôs a decoy grenade !
---
I love Rainbow, and I appreciate the effort of the programmers, designers and artists 
---
But the realism edge that Rainbow has is kinda going away.
---
Why is Wamai aiming and Mp5 with one hand on a situation like that. And why is Kai looking at him and not the people just about to open fire on them.
---
I know I‚Äôm nitpicking!
---
Veri nais, i'm not lucky enough to win though.
---
Pretty cool idea
---
Thanks!
---
Defense- Rook, super basic defender with great weapons, all you have to do is remember to place down the armor
---
Attack- Thatcher is a great option, chuck an EMP and fry everything, just make sure to avoid Jaeger's Magpies
---
I‚Äôm here
---
That‚Äôs pretty similar to what I use. 39 vert and 53 hor
---
Is this moving for anyone else when they focus their eyes on different points or just me?
---
#UHHH  INTERROGATION INTERROGATION
---
Sweaty in casual
---
But surely Netflix paid Ubisoft to make this content? And it‚Äôs not like any of those was that hard to make either... I just don‚Äôt buy it as anything other than being greedy.
---
Should? Debatable.
---
Will? Absolutely not.
---
Ay cool
---
Well actually that‚Äôs not casual*he says in the most annoying voice possible*
---
It‚Äôs here somewhere
---
If you have the Season Pass it gives you 10% discount.
---
Guess OP has it, that's why it's 1620 (1800-180).
---
Well first and ill say it again im not serious or mad or anything im just asking a question and second of all no one is complaning about counter strike because they didnt add groups with their flag on them and gave every class a backstory 
---
I know they will add them eventually but its just funny how they didnt add them from the start
---
Sensors over the shirt?
---
Can you do one with sledge but there also a sickle that crosses over the hammer
---
me to best map of siege
---
Hoping to get some hibana stuff
---
I have a great rainbow six siege 6 neon light already from these guys! I‚Äôd love another one! Aiming to get 3.
---
;)
---
It‚Äôs usually faster just went shithouse for like an hour, also making some upgrades on my computer soon as it is getting old
---
ubisoft 75% in it for the money and 25% in it to make games
---
Why Nintendo gets away with putting in a paid subscription in their free mobile games that‚Äôs perks are letting you get loot boxes and fixing issues the game makes (like storage limit removals) and people go ‚Äúit‚Äôs just cosmetic!‚Äù yet ignoring this stuff makes a grindier less enjoyable game.
---
Also for my ads use 42 lol
---
Just f-ing rush
---
Isn‚Äôt their cut exposure?
---
I would totally kill for Bojack Horseman's horse heads that human actors use when, they for example play Bojack in movies.
---
The hostage wasn't dead, fake cosplay
---
Why would you answer to my comment, I did not talk about Jackal.
---
I think they put it at that price to sell more elite skins. Sounds stupid but hear me out, if you see that limited cosmetics are almost as expensive as an elite skin, what would you go buy? Probably the elite skin.
---
Nothing is more terrifying than a Peruvian woman flying through a window at mach speed
---
Only thing I hear is ‚ÄùRELOUDING!" for some reason
---
*laughs in Brucie*
---
All these operators ur making are good but there so broken
---
But why would they have to pay a fee? This seems like Netflix is the one winning here as it‚Äôs exposure. So it was either free or they paid Ubisoft. Advertising other stuff, especially stuff like this, usually doesn‚Äôt help Ubisoft. They could have just made a random event sold some skins and made all the profit then?
---
Good god you're braindead
---
Rainbow Six Siege.
---
I can try too and get it straight out if I do!
---
Oh shit, he is.  
---
My bad! He feels so slow tho. Gonna run some matches tonight and play with him a bit to get a better feel. 
---
Sorry for any confusion!
---
Your the best I would love to see a communist sledge
---
I think they have a deal like Netflix pays to have the event and in return they get a share from the sold bundles cause like that it‚Äôs a win/ win for both of them
---
F for the rest of it.

Imagine them adding updatesüòÇ
---
you can turn off that intro in the general settings
---
20 - 80 - 50
---
Tbh the Halloween sledge skin was the same price
---
Did you mean the p9
---
Interesting concept, but I doubt the P90 will be a secondary anytime soon.
---
Games don't need to reflect reality, deal with it
---
If you get the final kill, though, that ends the round with a win.
---
Yet this game is all about reality ?
---
Wamai is a cyborg
---
Found a level 42 plat 2 with 2.5 kd and 7 win loss in newcomer. Obv smurf but still
---
This is true
---
&gt;But surely Netflix paid Ubisoft to make this content?
---
Even if, it still doesn't prove that all the money from the bundles go to Ubi. Do you really think Netflix begged Ubi to make two skins, paid them, let them keep all the profit, because this show and our platoform need more promotion?
---
Wamai is like a cyborg
---
Why don't we... Hear me out for a sec... Remove all maps huh? Are you satisfied then???
---
I was just in a game where I took down 3 people in 15 seconds. Then since I couldn't hear the 4th guy he proned down and then peaked which normally I'd be able to hear and punish pretty bad however I couldn't hear him crawling around.
---
I feel like if you say ‚ÄúI got an ace‚Äù the majority of people are gonna assume you killed all 5 people. It‚Äôs hard to do and that‚Äôs why people get hyped over it.
---
If you say you got an ace, and go on to explain how it was 2 kills then it‚Äôs just kinda like ‚Äúoh, alright man.‚Äù 
---
It might technically be considered an ace, but I wouldn‚Äôt personally say I got one unless it‚Äôs all 5.
---
Don‚Äôt give Ubisoft any ideas
---
But why would you use it? If you have to directly shoot the enemy why would you not just kill him with your main gun.
---
It a waste of a thatcher because he already so much( better use)  to do, he has to counter tricking/help the hard breacher and help deal with echo drones if you don‚Äôt have IQ.
---
Yeah guess you are right but I just thought since they put them on the most used guns for Ash and rook then they would do it for these guys too.
---
It was hella broken it was made for t-hunt and t-hunt only so the enemy could just sit and wait by the entrance and get an easy ace plus there were no precautions to limit spawn peeking so you could just wait and spawn kill the enemy team in seconds if you got lucky
---
That‚Äôs like an elite skin and a half
---
Oh yeah true. I had plat trophy on ps4 and when I got it on pc thry had removed it.
---
This could be abused by people who want to intentionally teamkill if the kills by it are automatically determined to be due to the defending operator. It also seems very annoying to loose control of your firearm. More so than a lesion mine or ela trap
---
Direct counter? Will her rifle pierce the shield?
---
It‚Äôs all about balancing but I generally prefer Bartlett than favela/tower
---
All jokes aside this is a great teaser for people who are on the fence about getting the game. 
---
One thing i feel that turns a TON of people away is that they get completely shit on when they start. Thats normal, and its how everyone from the beginning has learned to play.
---
I think they changed them at the start of Phantom Sight.
---
At the time Hibana pellets wasted Jager's ADS I believe, so if there were 3 ADS's in one room, one hibana shot could remove all 3
---
I‚Äôm positive it was like mid October or maybe early September at the earliest. I could be wrong tho. And yes i too, love his running animation
---
Top tier headgear though
---
People probably got mad that they put them on guns that already had skins so they did the guns that haven't received skins yet. For example look at the mpx the 2 skins look almost identical
---
Neat giveaway! I hope I win. Some of it I will keep but I might also give some of it as gifts
---
Yeah I can understand that. Tbh I'm excited for the 427 because it will match the lion pro league too.
---
caivera rule34
---
sorry wrong tab
---
I think some of the QOL changes since then would make the map more tolerable (especially spawn picking)
---
Netflix sponsored tho
---
Oh fuck. So its house and plane combined, my two least favorite maps.
---
Then theres tower and favela... we dont talk about those
---
Have been playing since launch and it's cool to see some licensed merch ü§©
---
Agreed.
---
Yh same problems
---
Okay. It‚Äôs a trap but it only lasts a set amount of time. And I see that about thatcher. And if anything echo drones are really easy to see when they are cloaked for me. Because it‚Äôs all warbley it makes it easier to see than when uncloaked.  So just look at them. Also iq would be best for that bc you don‚Äôt know when you gotta be looking up
---
I just posted what the jager skin looks like
---
I think that was the intention.. for the tks to be awarded to the defending operator.
---
But I just got black ice for him :(
---
Why do they look like bad guys?
---
[deleted]
---
Wut, I‚Äôm so confused. Why is that bad?
---
Also the ‚Äúspecial event‚Äù is a sorry excuse for an exclusive event. It‚Äôs just hostage on bank.
---
Hibana has so many bundles omg, she has 2 pro team skins, an elite and a bunch of others. Show other operators some love, jackal has like 1 bundle
---
For what gun? If you got it for the assault riffle then you are in luck because they put the new camo on the shotgun.
---
Lmaooo
---
Absolutely I think it's about as honest as can be in terms of giving an idea of the challenges of starting this game now. But the player base has continued to grow so I guess that speaks volumes for how fun the game can be.
---
What the fuck
---
It was my first time using fuze‚Äôs lmg and I forgot to add a sight lol
---
PEEK ONE MORE TIME! I DARE YOU, I DOUBLE DARE YOU!
---
It's like a free sample, but you have to pay.
---
It's brilliant.
---
I'll return the favor if you do mines first.
---
Literally unplayable they should fix that
---
That‚Äôs fair, but that speaks more to your abilities and skills than to theirs. Haha
---
What would be an appropriate amount of time for this? Knowing he would have maybe 2-3 charge. Yeah I know echo drones are easier to see when they just shoot but what if he doesn‚Äôt shoot and use them to give callout and ping you? 
---
I know IQ is better for echo that‚Äôs why I added if you dit have an Iq thatcher becomes the man for the job.
---
So that‚Äôs where bandit‚Äôs ACOG went...
---
But you took down 3 people
---
Ive already seen it but i appreciate you telling me
---
K bro
---
You already get renown if you have a duplicate. So if they implement the salvage feature, which they absolutely should, this won't matter. If you get an item you don't want you salvage it for renown. Get an item you already have, you get renown. Having renown in the packs just decreases the chances of you getting something cool with nothing to gain. Unless the renown drop was huuuuuuuge.
---
I've got craploads of terrible common skins that would I would to get rid of. Most of them I would just delete (ie no renown) because they are so ugly and just take up space in the loadout view, but doing that would open me up for getting the same stupid thing again. So hell yeah, I want to salvage skins.

*gets one clutch by rushing from the first window*
---
Omg this is the best tactic ever, from this point on I won't do anything else than this.
---
That happened to me today
---
Wrong
---
prolly not, ubisoft is pretty needy when it comes to your money. so either but a new account or boosters.
---
This is too crazy. It just makes no sense at all. No thanks
---
why thank you
---
With that massive head, pulse could be Megamind
---
Ubisoft getting greedy with the amount of storage needed

r/theydidthemath

Someone in our team: *Mute would be good to pick you know?*    
---
:literally no one reacts at any way, complete radio silence:    
---
Me: *OH FUKKIN FINE*
---
Yeah but irl balance doesn‚Äôt really matter. And you can always fix a jammed gun it just takes about half a second.
---
On this point they should add a realism mode where absolutely everything can be damaged broken or jammed
---
GG too EZ
---
What if, like, Valk is running and the new guy is just taking a casual jog?
---
Anyone remember realistic Rainbow Six?
---
RIP Tom Clancy :(
---
Oh, believe me, I know how that goes. I've been playing since beta and play with a friend who is a top duelist. As you play, you will adjust. Parrying seems like the best thing to do in most scenarios, but finding the moments when it's better to block is your best thing to focus on. Just play, and you will better your skills. Sadly, the best platform is PC because of the timings. 30FPS for an ever changing game for PC with 60FPS makes it hard.
---
I don't know how consoles ranks split out in terms of true skill, but I see this in high gold on pc all the time.  Full of silver skilled players that were boosted to high gold, who think they are plat 2.  They will back seat game you, tell you what to do, meanwhile they die at the beginning of every round to a failed spawn peek or rush.  Also their other account is diamond.
---
Ah that explains why people claim she sucks.
---
Congratulations! Blessed by the Lord. {-}7
---
Thanks for the spoiler *sad face*
---
Defense Ying... I love it
---
The thing that bugs me the most is how long it takes to pull out
---
Way to long, maybe 1,5 seconds
---
That‚Äôs a stretch.
---
It's not a bad spoiler tbh it meant nothing to the series
---
Sure there‚Äôs no balance in real life but this is a game replicating the exact things like real life is not the goal. 
---
A good game is a game that‚Äôs balance, just imagine if attack has an op that kills all the defenders ( with one button). Your argument is: "well there‚Äôs no balance in real life" that would simply not be a good mechanic. 
---
Half a second is all it can take to lose a game. It ads rng which is absolutely not needed.
---
I don‚Äôt see the problem there
---
Cool
---
They made sober thunt entertaining lol. Nothing like turning the corner whilst reloading and hearing the familiar "beep"
---
Doing the lord Chanka‚Äôs work.
---
Yep
---
Uhh es cierto que te vas a ushuaia
---
Is that the Italian Beretta M9?
---
It still sucks as a side arm to backup your primary. 
---
When your ACOGed ARX runs out and you get caught by Cav during a reload your 3x scoped hand cannon is a pretty crappy option.  Similar situation if you are using Kaid and his shotgun with an ACOG. The gun just doesn't function as a good sidearm. 
---
If we can't take off the sight I would be happy to get another option. Literally any other mag fed pistol in the game would be awesome.
---
I mean they could've just do 5v5 recruits with those jumpsuits under the vests and everything it would look cool
---
Time to play casual and newcomer on my alt :)) -no reason , just feel like it. He he
---
~~not enough rainbow six r34 stuff IMO~~

Hello OrangeZebraStripe, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/dzqfln/what_is_something_you_did_not_know_until_playing/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

I literally commented that and I main him
---
No it's not. Think of how anti vaxxers get their "opinions". They do this kind of stuff. And since vaccines are dangerous this is true. Do some research next time you make an uneducated statement.
---
It‚Äôs all good, I kinda lost interest in part 3 anyway
---
That's alot of porn
---
Yeah. I personally like hyper-realistic games and the only thing that would work to kill all defenders would be an explosive meaning it destroys the obj so the attackers would lose. Also you can kill all the defenders with a push of a button toss a grenade into the right place with extreme luck you‚Äôll be able to kill them
---
Honestly, that‚Äôs close to how I became a thatcher main. He stood out to me as interesting in the betas and at launch. So I played him and Kapkan at launch (my k/d with him still sits at 2.4 with him after the last 4 years, because of how OP he was with his original EDDs). Eventually there were enough ops other ones began to interest me. But my team was like ‚Äúwe all main these ops, we need a thatcher‚Äù so I have more or less become reluctant to main him, but still proud of being integral to my OG squad and other teams.

it's not
---
DIVERTITI
---
hmm

The victory screen could have 4 of the 5 teammates and the Cav is missing and then she comes up from behind the camera with an interrogation ‚Äúvictory screen‚Äù with her pinning the cam to the ground and you‚Äôre able to see Cav ‚Äúinterrogate‚Äù the camera. And when she slices the neck, it goes to black/the stats screen
---
Nope I mean I‚Äôm reddit
---
Talk about a MONEY heist
---
He‚Äôs black, of course
---
Wamai do kinda be vibin doe
---
That's such a jerk thing to say, what's the matter with you?
---
New to reddit did not know my bad
---
But I wasn‚Äôt trying to make a discussion
---
I‚Äôm not accusing you bye, I think it was with valk but I‚Äôm just having de ja vu moments
---
Imagine playing Siege for eye candy.
---
He can open hatches with around 3 shots, which other normal guns cant do.

excellent work!

You won‚Äôt get banned for having a smurf account unless you hack or break the rules

You right you dont have to buy it. Thank you for stating the obvious. But something overpriced is still overpriced, even if you dont buy it. Asking them to make it cheaper and more in line to the other cosmetics only makes sense, these skins are no were near as good as elites, and should be cheaper for that reason (more than 100 r6 cheaper). So instead of stating the fucking obvious understand why people want them to be cheaper and a more reasonable purchase, and not a blatantly obvious cash grab attempt for a glorified advertisement cosmetic that they didnt put a massive amount of resorces into making.

Shut
---
same with the printer in the kitchen on outback, if you get shot and flinch backwards you cant be shot from some angles
---
High gold is trash. Especially on console.
---
Me downloading mods from minecraft
---
Also you'll look like a fucking roadcone like Bandit's recent halloween uniform
---
I do not know what people want out of skins. I personally thought a lot of these looked really nice.
---
Go to [r6.fix](https://r6fix.ubi.com/) and open a bug ticket rather than complaining about it on a fan run forum.
---
I remember hearing a month or so ago that there are rumors that in year 5 were gonna get proximity mines as a new secondary gadget.
---
Hahahahahahahahhahaahhaahahahahhaahahhaah right....
---
It‚Äôs for a bloody show and it‚Äôs hideous. Buy it or shut up
---
He's too dangerous to be left alive
---
Harry in the most unsmooth way checking out valk‚Äôs thickness
---
who‚Äôs Harry?
---
Which barrel is that ?

Don‚Äôt mind it, stuff circulates easily now with every app allowing downloads of video

could be buck, you never know
---
protip for your next posts on reddit: on the righthand side of the community is a box called:  Rules. 
---
These are rules that apply to the subreddit you are on. In this case the rainbow six subreddit has a rule 9 which says: no image macros. Just thought id let you know for in the future. no harm done \^\^
---
Damn they nerfed the keratos hard didn't they.
---
It is said to be one of the most annoying shotguns in COD history and I think it took them a whole year to nerf it.
---
No but youre a cunt if you deliberately keep it in a far lower rank than you are on your main

He posted it four hours before your comment talk about lazy.
---
I think money heist hibanna is wayyyyy better than her horrible elite
---
But she stayed invisible on cams, which allowed her to sneak up on Frost and surprise Doc. That‚Äôs something Nokk can do.
---
That's crazy, they all probably went offline after LOL.
---
If you're out of ammo in your primary then you can switch to your secondary without shooting yourself.
---
Then go post this on IG. Reddit is a discussion forum so don‚Äôt get pissy when people try to have discussions with you on things you post on said discussion forum.
---
I forget, I believe I use the muzzle break
---
Given how Valk was (almost) an Olympic Breastroker, she was probably a sprinter as opposed to endurance. Walani does really long free dives which means that he probably has a higher endurance than Valk. If it came down to a swim race, I'd put my money on Valk
---
F
---
If I wanted a discussion i would have flagged it discussion
---
Middle bottom especially looks like Priyanka Chopra.
---
Somebody had to say it lol
---
WOOW it took me a sec not gonna lie
---
You can stil shoot tho. This op would be borderline op.
---
Is this a money heist reference
---
The heck is this? I've seen a few posts like this, what is this test?
---
I ain't scared man
---
The sad part was you t-bagging like you accomplished something
