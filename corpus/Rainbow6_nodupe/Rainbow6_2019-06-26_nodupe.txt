Hijacking the top comment to say please if you would go subscribe to my YouTube channel!

Can some do the whole team rocker moto please I’m to lazy
---
If u were gold one, and kept losing to the point that u were in silver 1, do u really deserve the rank u were at?
---
What , you're not liking how I'm giving my opinion on hitscan choices ?
---

---
And btw nothing against the employees this had a bit of sarcasm so hit the brakes
---
Mmm I hope its borcht

All 4 sites on consulate is extremely defendable.
---
Visa and lobby holds just need vertical gameplay a lot more than the other 2 sites.
---
Wholesome!
---
It's doesn't jump but can it break through things like it's made of lead?
---
As a regular lesion player, I'm glad there are not many intellectuals in silver.
---
Hitscan is horrible , it's not latency friendly , and no I'm not hating the employees , again I'm just judging choices
---
A large part of blackbeard’s head hitbox peeks over his shield
---
Nope , just criticism
---
It's an fps game, so m+kb will have a higher skill ceiling and be more accurate (more precise movement). It's why people use 3rd party adapters to use m+kb with consoles, it gives them an advantage over everyone else.

I play plat, and get cav banned all the time still...
---
...you must be new here
---
I feel this on a personal level was one game off of plat ll than played two games against hackers got ddos’d twice and went on a losing streak all the way to gold 3. The life of a solo queuer
---
Ok - well, for what its worth hitscan would be a terrible idea for a multitude of reasons and would absolutely be more buggy than hitscan.
---
Nice
---
F
---
I think hes just the better player
---
I like it more than the russian SMGs. The recoil seems easier to handle but I'm on console so that might make a difference.
---
Yup. People like to pretend that these problems don’t exist and continue to defend the game. I don’t think a sequel is needed really but instead a MAJOR fix like one or two seasons dedicated to restoring the game and making it playable. I don’t care if we don’t get content as long as it makes the game enjoyable again.
---
But that's not too much of a concern when playing casual.
---
A projectile system is totally pointless in a game as up-close as Siege. Leading targets and compensating for drop would never be a meaningful part of the game, you just would never need to do them. And as a result of dropping the simpler hitscan method...
---
With how spotty netcode can already be with all the destruction in this game, add in projectile bullets and things get worse. Trades (which really shouldn't happen in hitscan) become way more common. The "your shot always lands on your reticle" aspect of Siege's gunplay is gone.
---
Faccs
---
That won't stop people from doing it, also the glitches come and go with each season so. In all reality people just need to stop exploiting them all together so it wouldn't even be a problem. We all know that's not going to happen so yes maybe they could go about it differently but it could also be the best way to do it.
---
I never realized the visual similarities between the nerf rivals guns and the fmg-9
---
Because that’s what heroes do
---
3 years of saving finally got level 75 lets go
---
It’s out of control this season
---
May I ask what the fuck
---
Notasmurf69420
---
Look buddy I don’t think you understand. It’s not about somebody not being nice to me in a video game. It’s about how that affects the environment of the game and makes it really toxic.
---
I main Echo so I HATE his ban. Mira obviously makes sense because she’s ridiculously useful at completely cutting off a push, and Lesion and Valk are so easy to play it’s just “I throw my gadget and sit in a corner lol” but Echo takes serious skill to be properly effective. What good is drunking someone with a Yokai if nobody can capitalize? People ban him because he’s always banned in PL, but those people know what they’re doing. Low ranks just spam ping and stun everyone in the first thirty seconds or throw them in random, useless spots.

---
&gt; what if there was a system to identify known game breaking glitches such as the iq glitch
---
..if a ingame system can detect a glitch, the devs need to know the glitch and detect it so they can tech the system. If they can do all of that majority of these glitches can be fixed will before updating the detection system. 
---
This is a extremely advance system that doesnt add much into the system. If they have a system that can detect anomalies like ingame glitches, their anti hacking solution will be magical.
---
Don't add a drop off , make the projectiles at a very high speed , might sound pointless but it'll solve the latency issues and unfair shots , I'm not here to mock , but you can simulate the same thing but make it more latency friendly and it's easily thought of , but hey I'm just someone with criticism , typical for reddit to bash people like me .
---
WEU? Very possible lol, I have about 900 hours in-game time.
---
Nice lol
---
u/Eduboy25
---
Yeah, I was a bit surprised when I looked at it and and fmg-9, and saw they looked nearly the same
---
Exactly I just use p12 when blitz it's a great gun
---
dont mean to be rude in any way but the person who just died can make that call out themselvs
---
I'm not bashing you, I'm bashing your idea. Projectile systems come with more latency than hitscan systems as an inherent property of their design. Projectiles taoe time to travel and additional calculations to perform. Hitscan does not.
---
? Alright buddy.. says the guy who cant aim for heads. And complains when he doesnt get a kill. oh! And the guy who cant see a C4. Lmfao fuck off. You call everyone bad when you're the one bitching about minor shit because you cant stand being outplayed. How very sad

Hitscan would be more buggy than hitscan? What?
---
Hey whatever you do, do not listen to this guy, sometimes you just need to reach out and that is OKAY dont listen to the negative look at the positive bud
---
&gt;Why? One marketing isn’t an issue lol.
---
Marketing is a hell of a issue. R6s is a live service game that has a active playerbase. Marketing the same game but with a new engine is only going to make sense to brand new players or the hardcore playerbase. Your casual player isnt going to rebuy the same game. 
---
Also Marketing is going to be a shitstorm when majority of the new games gameplay is the same as your older game, Same theme as the older game and the same operators as the older game. 
---
Porting/upgrading your current game into a new game engine isnt a 1month walk in the park. The game engine is a core part of the game, changing that takes months of dev work which means a ton of money. 
---
Only way that's going to happen is if the community is okay with no future updates to this game, no content updates to this game and then rebuying a full priced game at the end of things. 
---
R6S v2 is not going to happen for a few good years.
---
That’s tuff what rank are you and what platform?
---
Still didn’t have to try to vote kick him
---
Oughta
---
He didn’t use German like ever but he had sort of an accent and he explained it in one of his videos.
---
Not permanent though, that’s too bad.
---
Just like you won’t reply to that last comment. It rings to true. You need to runaway from it
---
that wasn't my point. even though multiple operators can fulfill a particular role, some are with better at it than others or far more frustrating to play against. a good buck is a nightmare to play against on maps with open flooring
---
Oh yeah just waste everyone else’s time just so someone can get a number on a leaderboard...
---
If you need to talk, vent or just shoot the shit you're more than welcome to message me. Something may seem totally broken or unfixable but i promise it is. Years ago I was doing enough opiates to kill 3 adults a day(literally) and thought I was a worthless piece of shit. My life has done a complete 180. It can be done, keep your head up. Holler if you want to talk.
---
Heh uhh copper 3... And ps4.. Ive run into lots of throwers, I used to be gold in previous seasons
---
Do you allow bad players in? I want a team but there are no team that like bots.
---
About as steep a learning curve as, say, csgo
---
I would say terrorist hunt - terro hunt classic is just get in and kill everyone - is a great place to start (for gunplay and map knowledge) but dont think that being good at t-hunt means you'll be good in ranked play. 
---
Pick an op you like the idea of, that suits your playstyle. If you generally play aggresively, a 3 speed like ash or iq is where to go. Get in and grind to get headshots near every time on hard maybe. On pc the competition is tough 
---
When you're happy, start simple in casual. Rook and mute on defence, sledge and thatcher on attack. That way youll learn how passive abilities help just as much, if not more, than aggresive abilities like caveira or ash
---
And if you want some help with anything from bronze to plat levels of play, pm me and I'll see if i can get on to help a brother out
---
Ok you are obviously hacking I mean cmon IQ on console nice try
---
I cannot replicate this
---
Learn maps, play with squads, practice a lot
---
Ya cooper and bronze have lots of shit people I was there just last season once you get to silver it more or less stops
---
im not im lookin at his bio
---
Yeah it’s getting bad, it started small last season but this season it’s really bad
---
Also if you can try not to be nervous and act like rank games are the end of the world. You play best if you are calm
---
but im a toxic cunt so i did
---
I've been stuck in copper lol, but whatever
---
I get those teammates all the time and it make me want to die
---
I dont play cas bro
---
Sounds like an amazing player in the making.
---
We made this clan with bots in mind we will help train you and treat you with respect all bots and pros are aloud in
---
I feel your pain I was hard stuck copper for 4 season
---
*F*
---
It hates you
---
We already got a fire launcher, and just giving him more shots Is not a good idea
---
You are the type of player that is hard to find and are the most wholesome
---
Especially if you turn off displaying of names
---
H
---
I came here to say that!
---
nice reference btw
---
You have to try protect hostage. Fully muted walls , castled doors and fully electrified barbedwire hallways with bandit and kaid. You literally need to just wait and win xD
---
Yup. I've gotten gold but I'm also off sometimes, like not that good. But I know one day I will get up to platinum or diamond, I just gotta keep trying
---
They probably found another method rather than the just have a bunch of spaces but its a common trolling thing. dont worry about it.
---
Mozzie was the only one worth
---
Too bad it’s not the mp5😔
---
Everytime i go to ban someone else like mira a teammate begs us not to cause hes a mira main. The one time we ignored one them they just left
---
It's not about ddosing. This shit happened to me and my friends A LOT when we we queuing as a 3-4 men stack and the moment the game was found for us we all would get an error message and would be able to start the queue again. To 'reconnect' to the game we all would have to restart our game and only then it would prompt us that we have been dced from an ongoing game where we would find 1-2 poor teammates already loosing. 
---
This game is a fucking mess from the beginning. You don't have to ddos or anything, this garbage barely works on its own.
---
we get it, they get banned a lot, can we stop posting these please?
---
You're not supposed to grab random women

I have it too. For the memes

Adding on to this 100% legitimate thread, I bought a ~~fursuit~~ house yesterday!

Pulse, Jaeger, and Sledge in E. That's all I needed to see

Thank you!
---
The forbidden operator
---
None of them unless you can get kills with him because he’s otherwise worthless.
---
So people can copy/paste and abuse this and win? Don’t worry I can’t do this I’m console lol
---
His helmet looks like some kid who just discovered photoshop
---
I can get kills with him pretty easily, but in my opinion he is way easier to counter on maps like Coastline or Skyscraper
---
They should make it so that whoever last damaged the player before leaving or DC should be counted as a kill and then assist to the others
---
normally I wold agree, but I feel like this has to be intentional. Like there's no way he doesn't see his teammate there. If people are just bad at the game I don't think they should have to be shamed for it. But if someone is being toxic and intentionally killing they're teammates, then we are only showing how they choose to portray themselves.

Mira,  her smg is alright and she’s lethal with that c4 and her secondary shotty.
---
You can’t copy paste into game chat, but just holding down the button will spam it. And yes you could
---
Pretty good.
---
In that regard, there’s probably not a best map, just worst maps, which would probably be the more open ones.
---
What if you. Wanted to play Jackal. But God said:
---
Shields just get nothing, like Ubi just forgets about them. Despite the fact they have nice open areas to kinda do whatever they want visually.
---
Monty and Blitz actually cause people to lose their brains. It’s the weirdest damn phenomenon, but it is a real thing.

Basically, hitscan is a much better way to design Siege since having to mess around with ballistics would just make the game a lot less consistent than it should be.
---
Overall maps where attackers can easily push you fast from all sides
---
You existed!... Also love you xx
---
Thanks also mozzie has c4 and a secondary shorty but Mira’s cheaper
---
Yeah, it really sucks
---
The game is at its worst state right now in terms of bugs.

I think we found the Pulse player!

Dont worry, I'm working on a fix to that ;)

Dude steam is also epic exclusive dont you know? I used epic launcher to launch steam to launch r6s

Mira is banned too much

Exactly.

So a guy can run around in a cosplay and your cool with it but a guy wearing the enemy uniform from over 100 years ago is not alright?
---
Yeah not trynna be toxic but not relevant sorry
---
Why u he no get TKD for dabbing?
---
Finka and lion are good for a attacking. Alibi is good for finding enemies positions Valerie’s cameras are good. With mozzie if you hide hacked drones in corners of objectives and maestro is good at destroying breach charges and x kairos pellets as well as bieng a camera
---
ok here's what happened; since fuze had to activate the cluster charge he couldn't put his hand on the trigger fast enough. So he had to imitate the recoil and gun sounds of the lmg. If you think back to the movie reck-it-ralph you'll understand.
---
He did come out with the map border
---
MIRA IS THICC MILF
---
How mad would you have been if those missed shots on lion got you killed! Also who the hell okay Dokkaebi and Lion against someone with no team. This has gotta be gold, right? Everyone in gold a bastard.
---
Im 100% against mnk players but theres no way you can 100% prove someone is using mnk. My friend plays with very high sens and gets accused of using mnk all the time. Mnk players on console need to go saudi and get excucu---

If I was you I would drink so much water that I would be wanting to drink more water yes water yum I am thirsty

They did. What a game that was.

It's any symbol. I just posted a video from casual where they were spamming &amp;

You answered your question already. TEAM. BASED. GAME.

Imagine being top fragger then 2 teammates think it's funny to make u gain less elo so they blast you. Sounds like a lit idea.

No, because it would make the game scarier and make people take it more seriously.
---
*Everyone liked that*
---
You definitely can. If it looks like this horseshit, it is 200% mnk. I play on a sens where I get accused of it too. You can distinctively tell.
---
Having 9 people on standby for a minute to give a kill to one guy isn't toxic? I know it comes from a good place but wasting people's time isn't worth it.
---
Same, old one was fun sometimes but overall just not good.

---
quit witch hunting.
---
Didn't even occur to me. I'll test it out right now.
---
Something to keep in mind is that someone who buys cosmetics for their game, is most likely more dedicated to the game. However, you make a great point regardless.
---
Easiest way is to just play the game IMO. Play terrorist hunt if you’re still uncomfortable with keyboard and mouse. Adjust sensitivity based on your preference.Not much to it, cheers
---
When did I do that?
---
Well my idea not scenario
---
Mozzie since u only gave two options
---
Ayyyyye

Doesn’t matter you are playing with a shield

that’s what your post is buddy

Echo can singlehandedly deny plant from relative safety with his yokais. He can also provide tons of information. He is banned because he makes planting more difficult.
---
Do you go to the cloud district often?
---
Not once did I asl anyone to attack or harass them
---
somehow i think there gonna either take away echos ability to disrupt the plant or create an operator that can do the same
---
Lmao!!! This is pure comedy
---
It shoots fast and does a lot of damage it is better then Every shotgun in the game
---
Ok yeah that is true
---
He was like "ayeee, you fucked up"
---
Ooh I forgot about alibi! I’ll have to check him out.
---
The transition to pc should be easy for you since you already have experience with siege. Mouse sensetivity wise its personal preference, when practicing in t hunt start with default sens and slowly go down to your comfortable value
---
....this is still a witch hunt. you’re accusing people of toxicity with no proof they did anything wrong. quit witch hunting.
---
That’s what I though when I saw this
---
The problem was you could fuckin morph into a drone wit a gun
---
Between Mav and Alibi personally. I think Mav is a bit more useful relatively speaking though.
---

Vigil is good on any map. The enemy team drones and view cameras on every map therefore his gadget is useful on every map.

I usually use his gadget to deceive attackers and make them think I’m a floor above or below(Border and Kafe comes to mind).
---
Yes the background is from metro exodus
---
I never understood that when joining an ongoing match. Like, what’s the point?
---
The operators have some of the most situational (most often just useless) gadgets while also having bad guns, while also not being 3 speeds.  I honesty see very little upside for their play-ablility unless the guns are buffed (seems easier than reworking the gadgets).  But they can't buff the guns because that would also buff smoke and valk since they couldn't come up with new guns for these operators.  Overall just really disappointing.

Hello peterminator707, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/c5l5f5/i_hate_this/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I use smoke on defending and sledge on attacking, I'm not the best player so I doubt I'll ever really use a secondary lol. Thanks for your help
---
Bro you don’t even know what it’s like in that clan, so why don’t you get your self-centered selfish ass outta this post and mind your own business.
---
thats not a good attitude, and smoke is probably one of the most important operators in the game
---
Siege really is in a garbage state right now it seems like. I haven't played sine the end of Burnt Horizon but jeez it doesn't sound good
---
Yeah, even a Double-Queue is better than solo. And map wise, find a friend and play some custom games.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if some at Ubisoft went "wait.... shit"
---
Lame you don't even have the full pink set up. Missing his helmet and shield.
---
You know that now Ela is one of the worst operators in game. With one of the worst kits at that with her shotgun being her only claim to fame anymore. Yes I main her.

---
Outback is a whole different monster
---
&gt; Well, the average player will never have knowledge of which operator is ban-worty strong on any particular map.
---
The average player can absolutely know some of this with experience. It doesn't take a pro to realize Nomad is great on narrow maps where her airjabs are certain to get someone. Or Buck is great for Chalet. Or that Mute and Mozzie together are great.
---
Still, the 4 bans in the post are there exactly for the reason you said. If you can't properly counter them, why leave them in?
---
i keep forgetting, who's the second attacker that gets banned always?
---
They'll never know because you won't be in-game to tell them
---
I tried using that, it worked for a little bit but I just didnt like the feel of it ya know. Thanks for your help anyways
---
The other team has made a grave mistake
---
It really is.  Now getting ddosed comes with an abandonment saction. New glitch came out with shields, iq, clash

Same here
---
You’re missing the point

I believe that’s impossible, as everyone now gets at least 6 operators (all year 0 and possibly year 1) with even the lowest version of the game

Double no ban. You are truly horrible people.

Teams that pull this bullshit are unskilled and never deserve to have their skill surpass a Copper 4 in a coma. If you can't defend it properly you don't deserve that dub
---
Dude, are you like a wizard. I’ve been needing black spray paint for a few weeks but it couldn’t happen because of financial issues. I was thinking wrapping it in black duct tape
---
Yeah, but this happens every other game and to several different players at the same time, so the servers are lagging, not necessarily the players. The servers HAVE really  gone to shit this season.

Don't forget the steel plates they wear underneath for that extra protection.

Onetime someone did that for me, it was the nicest thing ever, big mcthankies from mcspankies
---
idk, found $5 black spray paint on amazon with 4.5 stars.
---
since im in higher ranked games its been happening all of the time.... On attack the enemy team hit the servers or lag switched and everybody's ping shot to 4,000 but I could still talk in game chat to my team fine. On defense. they would hit it for prep phase, turn it off for the round, and then rush plant the defuser and hit it again so we couldn't defuse it. really mad because the team sucked
---
that's cool and weird
---
This season is shit tbh. Taking a break for this one playing arma 3 and just cause 4
---
How is anything wrong
---
She(you?) looks just like her. Very awesome.

You have multiple flairs too

it almost got unplayable with the amount of times there were doing this and muting the text chat doesn't stop it either.

The FMG-9 is probably my least favorite SMG lol. Vigil, Kapkan, and even Bandit's SMGs have been more reliable for me.

I can understand blitz, barely but still. Why is Jackal a universal ban? He’s rarely picked and not broken even when he is! I just don’t get that ban. You could ban actual annoying/broken ops like Legion, Mira, Ash, Blitz, BlackBeard, etc.
---
Ah I see you’re a man of culture

Lag spikes up every 5-6 seconds, you can hardly even do anything. People constantly leave the match, you end up in a 1v4/2v4 almost every time if it's the enemy team doing it.
---
I play Ela quite often with her SMG and I can you it effectively. I think you just need to adjust your play style with her. That’s what I did.

If you’re smart you just stay calm, bait yourself and get an easy kill or two as they rush in

If someone actually gives this a reddit bronze or silver thing, I’ll calling the cops because you’re a wizard
---
One of the rules of cosplay is don’t sexualize the cosplayer
---
&gt;taking the higher road and just nutting them,
---
Due to the high amount of children playing this game its advise that you do not nutt on your teammates.
---
Already forgot when you were noob like that? I suggest deleting your sucky attitude.
---
Have you tried muting them from chat?
---
You cant get kicked in ranked games.
---
I have likely much more hours on her than you do one. I know what her playstyle is. Two the gun is statistically and in practice the worst gun in game.
---
Yes, even disabling chat altogether does not work
---
Ah a classic montagnepost

Speed and headshot invulnerability glitch. This season is retarded.

Personally, I think Hibana is better than Nomad and why on Earth is Clash a ‘B’???

"Out of sight, out of mind"
---
I never said it was hard it’s just not as practical
---
That's what I just said, the most useful operator we would have for that particular situation would be Lesion, and his Gu aren't even in a useful spot. If it's a 4-4 overtime match point? Fuck. Yes. We'll be bringing Jager, Lesion, Mute, probably Ela, and Vigil, at that point it's a last ditch effort to win, but if they pull that shit on round 1 they are automatically scumbags. We always stick to operators we feel comfortable playing until the third round when we have an idea of what operators everyone is using, and by that point we're already in a state where we literally flick on each others heads (I did that a few times to my squadmates, they took it pretty well after they found out it was an accident though)

this is the 18th fucking ela cosplay this goddamn week
---
But he isn't 17, it's he? I wouldn't mind him being a rebel of some sorts but have you seen the victory animation with the fucking gang signs at the end? That's almost as bad as dabbing or fortnite dancing. His design is also extremely uninspired.
---
sadly didn't allowed to get a job 
---
and sad fact nowdays kid able to afford 500$ + PC withou getting a job
---
I mean everyone has their opinions. To me you're only a scumbag if you cheat/glitch or if you run out and spawn kill when the round starts.
---
But you can lean irl, nothing stoping you, I mean maybe not that much, but.
---
I don't actually remember that. I remember just standing at one place because moving means death. I prefer the new basement to the old one anyway. 
---
Also the second floor obj is better that the old Hereford where Blackbeard just waits at the window.
---
I agree with you, but add the Blitz/Dokk/Lion/Jackal thing on round 1 and I'll decide to upvote
---
rogue9 made a video on it
---
All of it.
---
So, at first, I thought it was a good cosplay. You bought the right stuff, threw it all together, and it looks accurate. No. 
---
It's an amazing cosplay. When I saw in the comments that you created everything, from the pattern on the jacket, to the even the details and light on the grzmot mine. You have extraordinary attention to detail. Thanks for posting!

Some people say not to fight it but let alone it’s self defense

Holy shit that’s one of the most accurate cosplays I’ve seen amazing work

Perfect representation of FMG 9, a damn toy gun.
---
And most Youtubers get clips from a week or two in advance before making a video
---
Every ela cosplay I find makes me blush, no exceptions. Nice detail on the clothing.
---
Speaking as someone at the Silver level last time I played its seriously not that hard to shut down your average Yasuo. As previously mentioned Rammus is a hard counter to just about any AD Hypercarry that doesn't build Black Cleaver. Not to mention most Yasuo's are either brain dead bots that go 0/15 in the first five minutes, feeding the jungle and Mid or their smurfs who have played literally only Yasuo since he was released. And if you really want to make a Yasuo cry just play Olaf and build tank. Or you could always just go full AP Sona and hope he doesn't outscale your healing and damage XD.
---
Aww, so sad :(
---
Ok?
---
I respectfully disagree.
---
Also I didn’t find out who said culprit was until my friend told me, after I made the post
---
Paranormal activity
---
There should be a remake option if its less then 5 players on a team during the Ban phase.
---
Stop
---
You should also get more if you win because one of our teammates got spawnpeeked in the first round and left but we still ended up winning but still got normal mmr
---
If we’re rating jokes by rarity, these cosplays are whites at best, and iq frags are green.
---
They should’ve just removed his smokes so he can’t solo push and has to rely on a teammate for smokes

I would honestly take anything over what they did to him. It just baffles me that something this stupid was chosen among their ideas of how to "balance" him.

---
If you have suppressor on glaz you're a poopy face

It sucks so much that you lose normal MMR when you've been struggling since you're down one man in the team. Ubi should definitely readjust the calculation of MMR.
---
Why must you mildly stab me in my extra thicc back
---
Yes, the next two have been leaked to be IQ and Tachanka
---
Baeulo, Godly and Skittlz are definitely spending inordinate brain power on the lean keys.
---
It's kinda like a grenade pin that she pulls out to activate
---
IIRC I've seen a post where there's only one player on one team while the other one is complete in Ranked. I don't know if it still happens but Ubi definitely needs to fix the matchmaking.
---
I feel you on the team killing and shitty team mates in general. If you want to win just try to play smarter than the other team which doesnt always work because everyone on my team gets removed or leaves but thats just how shit goes playing solo in a game like this
---
If thats how you finish your kisses, I wouldnt go for it
---
Calm down.
---
Now that's real cosplay and not low-effort attention seeking, nice job
---
Can I have an honest question about cosplaying in Russia and Ukraine? 
---
I see a lot of russian,  ukrainian cosplayer doing very high quality, very expensive cosplays, even R-rated here and there,  sometimes even in a group as a studio specialized in cosplays. Obviously this is not unknown in other countries either, but almost without an exception almost all of these cosplayer are from Russia or Ukraine. Is there something behind this? Does it have a special culture behind these? Or just FB, Instagram algorithm pulling something? Don't get me wrong, I like the good quality cosplay and you and many others are doing excellent jobs with your work, just really curious about this "phenomena".
---
I'm on xbone, and it does have a little bit of recoil, and I'd honestly just rather have a better gun, the hax arent that good, it feels like every time I use him ppl move as soon as I switch back to weapon, if he could use it with his sidearm a la IQ that would be interesting.
---
Why is A-F hard to understand?
---
I may be a console peasant but atleast I don't have to deal with this shit XD
---
I think the music is still in the game, but only in situations. Still, it would be cool to have it as the main menu theme.
---
Dude it's a game, for me is ranked and casual the same with the difference of the game length. OK? If you have a problem with my play style tell it but don't start to insult. I'm really sure you won't talk to other people like this in rl.
---
5v5s are just training simulations the Real "Story" of Rainbow plays in terrorist hunt
---
It's still the same game there no differences in ranked and casual. Same engine, same textures, same feeling
---
Stunning cosplay, it looks fantastic.

But with Jaeger the shield is great. Put it in a doorway and you have a makeshift castle wall. They either have to jump over it to get into the room (leaving them really exposed for a considerable time period as they jump over it) or use up one of their breachers to remove it. It also makes his setup time a little bit faster which helps to get off site and roam.
---
I think you automatically get recruit but you can still change the loadout. I tried it in Ranked Reborn, so it could be different in actual Ranked

We had SI and ranked reborn... But yeh I understand why some players would find 3 round rotations to be shit.
---
Bruh did you scroll into the wrong subreddit
---
Honestly doesn't matter, if you plan on playing the game for an extended period you will eventually have all the operators.
---
Thanks gwandma
---
I wouldn’t. Twitch looks photoshopped in her picture and IQ’s training gear looks pretty out of place (but really good)
---
WHY IS TACHANKA AT THE BOTTOM?!
---
Just shitty matchmaking
---
As far as the game was concerned, I was never present. I literally could not rejoin.
---
I mean ranked reborn was for about 4 days. Then SI was every weekend for 4 weeks. About 12 days of gameplay. It might seem like a lot but it’s really not.

I feel retardeder reading this

That's good to hear, it was really frustrating when the whole enemy team is spamming this and it cause you to lose fights.  Thanks for taking the time to reply!

Its already been 40+ minutes

They were talking about someone wearing a wig, jeans and bikini top. There are better and worse halloween outfits, just like there are high and low effort cosplay.
---
Great cosplay, but next time please do Fuze!!!
---
Its not useless.  Its the same reason people take shotguns on operators like smoke.  They have strong gadgets and their weapon fills more of a utility role.
---
Oof.
---
It's beatiful  
---
That's the reason why I play Ela
---
I can’t unsee the shadow on the right as a goatee but I honesty like it that way
---
So was I. My girlfriend spent hours perfecting her cosplay only to have people who have never cosplayed tell her why her cosplay sucked.
---
Eh, they should just allow him to throw it. He could fuze ceilings then. Idk if I agree with giving him a wall hack lmao. What's to stop him from just using his ar to shoot through the wall or barricade instead of his charge?
---
I mean, the game has some basis in real life. It wouldn’t make sense to use a bullet that isn’t capable of going through thick surfaces when there are more realistic approaches to a high powered round like the one we’re talking about. I’m not trying to be rude or anything, I’ve seen some of the other comments. I think that he’s a great concept and think that his guns and ability do actually have a place in rainbow
---
ugh, you are one of those dropshooters!
---
How dare an operator be situational and not good in every situation. While being the most annoying operator to face and the best entry fragger. 
---
He is fine how he is now, actually requires some thought and skill into utilising his gadget.
---
Don't really care much about cosplay but this is actually one of the good ones, nice job
---
That title made me think that buck flicked around and popped a cap in your ass
---
You can work super hard on something without it appearing that way outwardly. I haven't seen your gfs cosplay though. Wigs can appear low effort, particularly cheaper ones, since dying your real hair will usually look better. It's super easy to fuck up and melt them, too.
---
They could get anti-cheat software that works
---
You can see the blood from fuse getting bopped in the head on the kill screen
---
But did you clutch
---
Just make a smurf acc and hop on newcomer easy 
---
^/s^
---
Very beautiful :) also guys go check out her other work! Maybe NSFW Ela soon haha!
---
MP5SD. That's it.
---
You could also equip one on Glaz to remove bullet trails through smoke.
---
There was a cinematic showing a few ops talking in a locker room after a "firefight," so based on what all the streamers and players mentioned and ubi acknowledging it I think it's safe to say that 5v5s are training simulations.
---
Her gadget is extremwly good for area denial, if she herself is in the near vicinity. Also her gun is just crazy good, and better than lesions in so many ways.
---
Whore
---
Every season there's a huge uptick in hackers, you pair this with the sale they just had and it makes it seem like they're more prevalent than they really are. After the first few weeks everythings back to normal because the scumbags are boosted to diamond and the burner accounts got banned. Ubisoft isn't about to let one of their biggest cash cows die so I seriously doubt they don't give a fuck. Youre overreacting.
---
if that thatcher is diamond then I should be a pro player
---
As long as you don't play newcomers, everything should be fine.

I'd like to see him be able to place stuff just away from the window, so if someone hears it, it gets destroyed and Fuze doesn't instantly die.

It's such a niche weapon though. I mean I feel like the only place itd really shine would be revolver competition shooting. And even then the company is defunct now.

That doesn't seem correct. What is your name in game?

Ping isnt really the greatest representation of network consistency, it's a separate system from the game stream, and ubi's ping statistics are gathered once every 3-5 seconds or so. The type of traffic/protocol etc being used to send pings back and forth is not even close to being the same protocol that is streaming game data and all that fun ubisoft jazz. So gauging the health of your network based on what the instance is reporting your AVERAGE latency as is not really helpful. You could be going from 5ms -&gt; 500ms and back in the span of a few milliseconds and would never see it through their statistics. 
---
There could be any number of things causing "lag spikes", from your computer setup, to the servers, to the route taken by your packets, to problems with the ISP infrastructure/bad weather somewhere along the route/etc etc etc. Don't start jumping to conclusions just yet. It could be entirely ubisofts fault, it could be a failing component on your end, could be a bad configuration on your NIC (do you have power saving shit setup on it? have you set the interface to use things like jumbo frames?etc?). If it's super annoying and you want a fix, start ruling out what you can on your side. Clear caches/temp, check your NIC settings, reinstall and update drivers, the works.
---
That has no impact on MMR awarded. 
---
You are awarded MMR solely based on your opponents &amp; how many matches you have played. Points/Kills you get don't have any impact.
---
God that is some spicy stuff.
---
What is the faucet? Looks like a r/Hmmmm if you ask me
---
Personally I don’t like the operator ideas, but I like it better than the people who don’t even try for cosplays (some of the cosplays are insanely good though, just wish there was more of other people than just ela and the new operators each season

---
Yep another one for the didn’t happen awards
---
I think he means the karma whoring guys, like the one with 4500+ up votes for putting a towel over his head and holding a nerf gun and calling it a Nokk cosplay. That’s not a cosplay, it’s a low effort joke and quite frankly insulting to the people that actually take the time to do a “real” cosplay.
---
Your game got updated to year 4 season 3, they removed all the ops because of the glitches.
---
orange tip is only required for selling and shipping in the us you can remove it after you own it.
---
Just a quick note; this was screen recorded from my instagram. Both pictures match( the profile pic next to name and the one in bottom right corner) and in the first clip you can see me open up the score board and it says ScribbleNauter, which is my username. Just didn’t want to seem like I stole people’s content!
---
ofc lesion will always have a higher pickrate because he is just better, but we don't need a second lesion, and kapkan is already annoying as hell
---
Ash is not a flex; everyone got it

It just came out

Nope you missed the Sniper 90
---
Clash? Now that’s a name I haven’t heard in a long time...
---
Ok so: 
---
A) please a small subgroup of people by staying historically accurate
---
Or
---
B) appeal to both genders by being inclusive
---
Seems like the choice is obvious
---
It’s my favorite spot for playing maestro or echo on that map
---
Yea I actually think he’s a better roamer than an anchor I usually roam with a reflex cause I’m not to good at spawn peeking
---
facts smh
---
I never said lesion needs a nerf, you are just talking about buffing kapkan.
---
Have you experience Maverick’s one?
---
The only crime here is the red dot sight
---
Never knew ela was inspired by real person
---
It clearly is the gaming chair
---
She even paid attention to the m1911 IQ has on the original operator card haha. 10/10 Details ;)
---
Either nerf the op one or buff the under used and overlooked ones?
---
Is this a joke post?
---
I don't think it's about the country but more about the special force. I understand that some people are more patriotic than me but I personally don't think that Germany has superior special forces.
---
Jezz
---
I think you placed your deployable camera a bit tilted to the right try adjusting it
---
Big scottish man smashes petite german girl.
---
thats not how it works
---
Starter used to be that base game operators were 12.5K renown each, all DLC ops being 25K renown to buy.
---
Standard has base game operators for 500-1000-1500-2000 for each CTU respectively, with DLC ops now costing anywhere from 10K to 25K based on when they were released.
---
The shotty black ice you can buy in the store in a bundle too.

As a Mute main, I sincerely hope every Bandits with shockwire fall down every stairs they take
---
yes
---
Woah there buddy
---
Truu
---
Balancing wise, pretty much.
---
I'm talking about before the nerf, where he can just throw down his smokes and walk into site and get easy entry frags, with literally no counter-play from the defenders as they can't see him. 
---
There are many executes where a Glaz can be good, Oregon basement, Chalet garage, Consulate garage, Consulate lobby etc., basically any time you need to plant smoke he can be picked and utilised. 
---
Yes because balancing from win deltas means a lot, I guess both Smoke and Lion need buffing as their win and pick deltas were below average?
---
This means Fuze will be banned as well. 
---
#NO PLEASE ANYTHING BUT FUZE
---
That's actually really helpful. Thanks
---
Yeah I was wondering, why ash is back and that’s concerned me, if Frost will be back too
---
balancing wise isn't always better for the game?
---
Is that a new map u playing on? Oh wow the graphic update looks crisp
---
Naw, that's all skill
---
did you miss the part about it loading up a page to apply for a refund if your specs don't cut it?
---
Thanks for your information
---
bruv it aint happenin im sorry
---
Do they also arrest people with real guns that paint tips orange?  Seems pretty stupid
---
I am weirdly okay with this
---
Where did you find that face??? It’s perfect!
---
May I ask how and where u got that jacket cause u are so detailed I would like to get one of my female friends that jacket since she is a huge fan of rainbow as a gift
---
Give Warden P90
---
Huh
---
God damn it *Alex*
---
at one point they actually had good operator charms, I don't remember if it was birthday charms or not but I have a castle barricade,  a sledge hammer and a chanka turret as charms that i got from challenges. This was before the garbage dog tag charms. They also used to give you a weekly operator discount on thursdays for a bit.  
---
I wish they would go back to that.
---
This is actually sad
---
I guess find another entrance
---
Cav and eco are justified bans, jack and blitzerino are just annoying to play against nothing more
---
To the people asking how people have never seen this before, I have almost 1500 hours in Siege and I've only seen people do this successfully in game a handful of times
---
I’m only 9 and I know what “Ela thicc” is xD 😂🤪🤪
---
I think it's just a difference in point of view tbh.
---
Some people look at it as a skill that should have proper craftsmanship and effort into it.
---
Other people just look at it as nerds having fun being nerds.
---
I don't think either group is wrong, but the really low budget, cheap cosplays that aren't ironic can be a little depressing. It's a lot more fun, imo, to get excited over something someone put some real time, thought, and effort into creating than slapping something quick together that looks like it came from a Halloween costume store.
---
I don’t think Mozzie and Gridlock have Pro League sets. I think that rn the available ones are Maverick, Clash, Nomad, Kaid.
---
Just wait for Smoke and Mute
---
In soviet Russia gun suppresses you
---
And that’s why they’re banned
---
I don’t understand...
---
Yup
---
I took a pause and returned after 2 years. Get ready for toxic and salty community. The community is completely ruining the game
---
Really? I tried it and had no success... gotta try it out more
---
I’m pretty sure it’s Blackbeard
---
Rainbow Six: Evangelion
---
Featuring Daisuke Ono as Echo
---
I think they also added bullets to Lesion's traps and impacts too
---
Oh crap! Thank you for reminding me, I thought using the ability would look cool in a selfie
---
Did you seriously just say Glaz was the best entry fragger? *cackles in Ash*
---
I think it’s the one where iq can go super fast in the ground making it impossible to shoot her
---
Our lord Tachanka thanks u
---
Excelent choice
---
A crouch walkers dream operator!
---
Ok thanks
---
Add the triple kill with a base to the list of kills I don’t deserve, but made me laugh my ass off

Hello Reeceyd1840, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/c5qzw0/im_not_one_to_really_complain_because_its_just_a/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
that's a big bruuuuuuuuuuuh
---
I have it on PC but not console because my PC couldn't handle siege I moved to console when red crow was going on, I'm glad to be getting her new one.
---
If you want a better on go through a C4 behind the chandelier on Kafe 2nd floor underneath the new drop from roof. I’ve gotten many a kill from it.
---
Upvote for trigger discipline
---
You know, I tested this a few days ago and was gonna post it here but you’ve stolen my internet points which is unforgivable
---
How are you playing as iq? I thought she was banned.
---
Can't hit that shot but when you have a fully deployed shield in front of someone they can still knife you ;)
---
I find it easier if you open a small hole close to the wall and just watch. If you throw the C4 up you can get it outside and hit more people and you can also shoot them as they walk in. It just leaves less room for error (I'm aware that they could see the hole but it has never mattered for me).
---
nice, good job
---
not a PC player but fuck yeah
---
I think Ela from r6 cosplays this girl
---
It makes it practically silent even if you're just the next room over. Useful for taking out cams/devices. It's insane ROF and accuracy (don't tell ubi) more than makes up for the extra bullet (accounts for like 20ms) added to the ttk.
---
People dont.
---
With a lot of people having either no or limited knowledge of airsoft, a lot of people think "a toy gun has a orange tip, while a real gun has a "normal" tip".
---
Most of the world doesn't require an orange tip on a (Airsoft) toy gun, but with the above mentioned stereotype...
---
You can fill in the rest.
---
oh no
---
I’d kill myself if I came up against that
---
日本人がこんなサブレディットに投稿すんの珍しい。Siege実際やってるの？

Nope. It's an exploit

I’ll never unsee this

Lord entering Slaughter mode!!
---
I thought the same thing - The headgear of the lord, but the beard of the lesser. Maybe it’s just a scarf?
---
I think I did record it horizontally, but Instagram puts videos vertically. Then I screen recorded. Let me see if I can fix it
---
It is 1000x more fun than Overwatch IMO, so much more rewarding for staying alive and succeeding with risky plays, outsmarting the enemy. Far better than “I pressed Q more than you, fucking trash DPS Mains can’t kill shit”. Where getting kills actually helps your team! Lol
---
I’ve never played overwatch before but I’ve heard that this game is slower for overwatch, bigger maps, more strategy, etc. As a starter you should absolutely not try the ranked playlist until you outgrow the newcomer playlist (lvl 50) I’m telling you right now with the situation of being unranked and starting the game, you are going to lose most of your placement games because of the large chance of queuing up with golds and platinums.
---
Xbox’s looking for group posts make it easier to find people to play with on casual, but you should stick with:
---
1. Playing the newcomer playlist
---
2. Finishing all the situations and getting 3 stars on them
---
3. Playing casual on bomb to get a feel of the environment in ranked
---
4. Playing terrorist hunt classic missions (the missions where you simply just get kills as an attacker- modify the preferences in settings)
---
By level 50, which should take a few days if you’re playing, you should be able to hold your own when into a ranked match, just remember to play objective on defense, and support ops are your go to. (Doc, Thermite, Thatcher, Rook, Hibana (dlc))
---
You’ll do fine
---
What if makhmood from ISIS decides to dressup and go shoot up a comic con how is the police gonna know that a person is carrying a real gun and is going to shoot up the whole comic con or whatever these things are called
---
Yehaw
---
Yes, not a single player in the game could move for the entire round after it was clear the defence was about to lose.
---
I don’t really think I can fix it because I lost the original when I got a new phone. Don’t worry tho you won’t see it in the future!
---
$60 down the garbage.
---
Wrong. Ash elite. Everyone else is fine.
---
Clearly rainbow 6 has changed drastically since I last played
---
U do u
---
What about you could still matchmake with your friends they just have to go agains people in the highest persons ranm?

But

Ur banned
---
Thats amazing you even added the compensator? Flash ?
---
No I had a random on my team do it every time the second prep was over he lagged out and didn't rejoin and the game worked fine
---
Not good
---
Japanese folks are a little more chill than Americans considering guns are, let's say , a tad bit more rare in Japan.
---
Also, you know, less rampage shootings compared to something like stabbings
---
Granted on sure someone in full riot gear and a realistic gun prop probably turned heads though someone else taking photos would probably help explain away what's happening.
---
To smash?
---
i’m 17 lol
---
Not hating or anything but shouldn't you need to paint the barrel a bright color so people know it's fake?
---
I actually kinda like those. At least you could equip them to every gun in the operator's load out.
---
Yes, he was. His ability to throw down smokes and walk in was way too strong. If you didn't know that then you simply weren't using Glaz right.
---
Did they hurt your feelings
---
So when i posted my own tachanka icon animation it gets removed by a mod for being unoriginal/unrelated to siege somehow but EVERYONE else is original and relevant when they post theirs? Fucking awesome.
---
It’s a soup can, not Mountain Dew!
---
You do whatever works for you tbh. If you can average 2-3 kills a round theres no reason to stop doing it.
---
Even though I hate spawn peekers I do it myself and sometimes it works, sometimes it doesnt.
---
So yeah you do what works for you.
---
nope, i forgot how terrible some people in this community are
---
Let me guess made in aseprite
---
who cares?
---
Great for verticle play, pairing with Doki, or pulse and vigil hunting.
---
Sorry to hear
---
Thankyou
---
thank you!
---
To bad she's fucking banned rn
---
nice i hope i get it for bucks i got 49 alphas rn saving upp till da new season

That Vigil was tryna get all of the kills im sure

not wrong tbh

Had this a few weeks back

I agree, SAS, they're all solid picks and none are OP.

For utility Thatcher comes close, but that's more due to the number of defender gadgets he counters.

Where is this info from?
---
The headgear was actually self made!
---
And they're all good picks on every map, thatcher is almost a must pick, sledge has great fragging potential and is a good soft breacher, mute counters alot of attacker gadgets and smoke is great at plant denial and wasting time

Gotta say, I don't mind her not being in game atm, it's been nice not having to deal with the utter cancer that is Clash.
---
Personal opinion? It was recorded fact; nobody cares about console because of its crappy graphics; crappy frame rate and crappy gameplay in general. Literally everybody agreed about that. And it’s was only a “funding issue” because Microsoft didn’t want to put money into something that; at the time; may not have gone anywhere. Look up the viewership rate; pc pro league vs Xbox pro league viewership wasn’t even remotely comparable.
---
Very cool
---
And here i am with my forth 417 black ice.

Blitz isn’t broken anymore, people need to stop banning him

The producer has to sell them with the orange tip, but the consumer can take it off legally.

Unrelated but,

Try playing doc with the shotty. Be a roaming steam train down the halls!! "Choo choo mudafukas"

i love doing that hahahahha

have you found the solution? because im experiencing the same thing right now

what is this black magic? that shotty is too op

Happened to me before.

I believe its in the shop

That dumbass doc

Vigil. Bosg is satisfying af.k1a is good too, both auto secondary are awesome.
---
Her AR is ripped bruh
---
wow ur so good I wish I was u /s

In all seriousness have fun dying to my drag grenades, capitoa or sledge above
---
That street looks as mad as when I went there
---
Wait will she be invisible to cams or so thicc she takes up the entire screen
---
For real tho. This is kinda an issue. I always seem to get out on an opposing team of 4 plats and a diamond meanwhile I have 2 silvers. 2 gold. Me (gold) and an unranked new guy
---
So for year pass you get the ops and with the season pass you get the ops and the other stuff?
---
r/casualracism
---
Getting mad Parabellum vibes from this
---
Plenty online
---
This is something that you dont need to see the hud and you know its console... That recoil doing some work LULW
---
Can't use same game.
---
Buy one on steam and 2nd on uplay.
---
Yes you need to have both downloaded
---
To play on alt you must log out of main first then launch it on second otherwise it will prompt up a message asking you to combine your steam acc with uplay and you don't want that.
---
If you actually read the title and finished reading my post, I said I was lucky as well. But thanks for your input I'm glad I spent 3 seconds reading it. Especially considering the incorrect use of the word pretentious.
---
I see the stipping on your AUG, so I assume it's and airsoft gun. CA, GFC or APS?

---
No Im not arguing with you that they arent easy to die to. Its mainly just frosts mats are an insta down if you miss them haha
---
That’s so sad :(
---
**sad console noises**
---
If the secondary wheels were powered as well, couldn’t it work?
---
Speech 100
---
True, but as I said, both just require awareness
---
Wait what. How does that matchmaking even make sense?
---
because you will never join them
---
That person is probably better than I am right now :(
---
Nokk got a kill*
---
If you're not good enough to get the kill before her you didn't deserve the ace to begin with.
---
How could anyone play this game on console. How could anyone play console.
---
Obviously deranking
---
Hmmm, maybe kinda lucky, but not so much? As I said, most games have Halloween events so it's easy to assume R6 would have one eventually.
---
You're welcome, happy to help!
---
Why not 😢
---
You have ARD-10 and one or two other special units. 
---
You don’t just join these units, though. Typically there is a selection process designed to make you fail (90-95% fail rate is normal, probably even generous), and depending on the unit itself you may have to be invited to apply for selection rather than just dropping a packet and then shipping.

---
What kind of watch is this
---
Pro League gold sets are sold which funds the development of the game whilst a portion is divided up into Pro league its self and the pilot program. The game has a cosmetic plan set out for over 3 months in advance, the first indication of the current S2 sets that existed was during the Test server in February. 
---
Each and every season welcomes new cosmetics, they never influence the base game mechanics and do not impact game play. The development teams are split up into various groups and one set will work on constantly testing and replicating exploits, whilst the other focuses on making new cosmetics. Their jobs do not interlope and so cosmetics can continue to be released throughout the season without delay. 
---
Just to point out also, they have deployed a new test server update this afternoon which addresses the fixes that the development teams worked on to continually replicate said exploits to the point where they could no longer do it, they now ask the community to do their best at breaking them down to ensure that the fixes are absoloutely solid. 
---
Consider complaining about something in future that actually ties to your point, it will garner more discussion.
---
Because if people start complaining about him, they'll probably buff his gadget or the MPX
---
It's a Mobvoi Ticwatch E.
---
You can start live chat from [here](https://support.ubi.com/en-us/Faqs/000025094/Starting-a-Live-Chat) and you can tell them that you have a video about it.
---
if the cheater is smart they can get past any ban, including HW and IP
---
0.6 k.d lmfao 😂
---
Ubi support
---
Or if your are a famous streamer/youtuber then post it to twitter and tag ubi/epi :D
---
As a former Echo main, he should just be removed at this point, I only ever get to pick him in casual now. Might as well not even be in the game.
---
Yeah
---
Scan me
---
Hmmm recruit is wearing shiney eyewear and snazzy suit in the last panel. New head canon: Warden and Recruit are the same people.
---
You look like you're missing rollerblades and a bag of sandwiches for delivery.
---
how could you buff his gadget? its very situational and theres no way to fix that to make him viable. Also buffing the MPX would make Valkyrie WAY too strong, arguably OP.
---
Good luck I hope you get many legendary skins.
---
just cancel and search it again, it can stuck smtimes
---
The other team banned echo so good luck Japan
---
Blitz has been banned in every ranked game I have played this season so far as well. Echo not always, but usually. I like to play echo, but cant say I dont like blitz being banned every time :D
---
Keep that grind up to gold!
---
Screenshot is for poo heads
---
It's never worked well for me, I've seen it work for rushing as Nøkk a few times, though.
---
Console is such a joke
---
Ubisoft: We heard you. Making IQ's and Blitz's pistol shoot BOSG slugs.
---
I’m having the same issue. Eventually matched after 20 minutes
---
I'm definitely trying to get there
---
I know how they work in the game. Its already better then the movies because they are audible but you get no threat indicator nor can tell the direction. But the discussion was about this victory animation. :-)
---
you on pc?

Anyone else notice the division agent in the background?

Where she's at (Japan) does not have the laws for orange tips. If you go to an airsoft store it might as well be a real gun store minus the lack of bullets. It's pretty interesting as an American.

I didnt know japan could have a standing army

Huh. so that's what IQ looks like. Its been a few days since I've seen her.

I disagree, although it can sometimes be inconsistent it will kill at long ranges pretty easy
---
Lucky, all I’ve gotten was black ice for the 552 commando on IQ
---
What is that AUG? Airsoft gun?
---
Totally fits her personality

It was for sale during year 1.

😂😂😂😂
---
R6 alpha packs are a fucking joke. There's so many items, they should just have loot protection so you never get duplicates. Overwatch does it. There's no reason why you should get a duplicate legendary or common so many times.
---
The only reason I see it staying in is greed on Ubisoft's end.
---
I found it easily under digital content.
---
To be honest i've never seen this skin even in legendaries list
---
this cosplay is good i thought you were actually ELA😂

I’m still waiting for the frost mat!

does he have dat 50 cal?

Sadly yes.

They are on the steam store
---
Whered you get the bane of my existence that you're holding in your hand?
---
Its next to Tokyo it looks like a t shape
---
There are a few Legendary items exclusive in the alpha packs. Getting a duplicate just ran his luck to where it *could* have been a different legendary. So now he may experience a long drought of commons until his next legendary.
---
Nice! And a good gun to get it on as well. I love that shotgun, really good for roaming
---
Yea that would be good
---
And to think that real shotguns are effective out to about 55 or 60 meters.
---
I'm gosh it's a GUN, without a magazine! Quick get the cops.
---
Nice cosplay though.
---
what?
---
Don’t you need an orange tip on the gun so piper know it isn’t real?
---
You really want to restrict the pool of people you can queue with? Queue times on Xbox are abysmal at times
---
Exactly
---
Awesome job! Well done 😁
---
But it would be for a better match experience.
---
I like the shotty and I'm sure the DMR is good, but it doesn't really for my play style.
---
Oh, my bad. I don't think that yearly operator bundles can go on sale, but I might be wrong. However Year 1 and 2 operators should be relatively cheap. Before you decide to buy Siege on steam maybe you can see if the price has been lowered ingame.
---
Glitch.
---
Bro I spelled
---
 #fortnut
---
Wrong!
---
No need to be so [REDACTED]
---
Nope tried it yesterday and it still happened my teammates kept doing it and the game was almost unplayable
---
I think shotguns are just better for roamers and people that can catch attackers off-guard. You can't really hold angles with most defender shotties so you need to be moving around. If you're within range, they have amazing stopping power.
---
It's actually not a 50 Cal, it fires 50 Beowulf, which is not as large, nor as powerful. Also, in the words of a siege YouTuber I don't remember the name of, *he got a mushroom on he head!*
---
Freedomland? Where is that country you speak of.
---
What was the glitch
---
That's basically a dmr. It doesn't even count towards shotgun challenges.
---
Just seen it now, glad you got the kill too. Nice job
---
This is so freakin amazing
---
Nice clutch but pls pse ur reinforcements!!
---
Nice.
---
Yes I agree that the shotgun could use a nerf, but her Scorpion isn’t in a bad place. Yea it’s got a lot of recoil, but so does the SMG-12, and they’re both pretty alright guns imo
---
Thanks for the info!
---
No but don’t take their silence as them not doing anything about any of the issues as of late.
---
Bruh all she did was put in some fake white strands in her hair, put on glasses and take a picture.

Today I saw a whole hell of souls getting banned we’ll have to wait till ubi Is done banning but it’s a start
---
disagre, they are so pretty and al relate to a personal thing in their lifes
---
Wait, that's illegal
---
SHE HAS A GUN
---
OK thanks we sound about the same i was plat 2-3. how long did it take you to get back to where you were before
---
You can definitely hold angles with defenders shotties, that's the best way of using them! You just have to hold short range angles like the top/bottom of staircases or just inside of windows/doorways. Force the attackers to engage you close range and you can definitely hold that angle on them. Some of my favourites are bottom main stairs on Oregon and blue stairs on Bank.
---
Means it's a work in progress
---
No communication does not equal no microphone. Most people have a microphone, they just don't talk
---
Please dont woooosh. I font understand
---
Should be there when you open the game next.  It's been doing that to me as well recently.
---
Wow and oof in one vid.
---
That’s the store I work at haha
---
Nope! They get destroyed. It would be nice if they got disabled, but Thatcher is fairly OP, IMHO, for clearing the defenders gadgets.
---
I know that the Evil-Eye gets disabled. I don't remember others that do.
---

---
Console glitch where IQ could do something with her claymore and she would become invisible and unkillable
---
As a plat, I usually play a few Thunt games w/ team or loan wolf to warmup and practice my aim with characters I use on multiple targets. good way to practice strats w your friends
---
"It's preference". Sorry what???? 200 ping is not a preference. You are abusing ping to get easy rank ups. Go to you home server and i bet you'll get dicked on in your "true" rank.

This was probably Thatcher's computer.

Oh ok! Thanks so much this really helped!

Yikes why are you so salty, I think I had a valid point to make. I’m not trying to hate on you, I want this game to be fair too

It’s better than getting two duplicates in a row of a fucking banana charm

Pretty sure the law varies state to state. In Cali you must have an orange tip I think? But don’t quote me on that.

Is that tts or are shields back?

I play on NA servers usually, that’s my default setting. When I play on EU or Aus servers I find that high ping gives me a disadvantage. Don’t hate on me, I’m just reporting my experience :(

Don’t it’s not worth it... [I’ve already made that mistake....](https://imgur.com/gallery/HXLfIsY)

When??
---
Because his turret is useless. His guns are alright, his ability is absolutely useless. Staying completely still and holding an angle is a sure fire way to get killed. In gunfights, you need to reposition, change the angle/elevation, perform a flank etc. in order to try and kill your opponent, and Tachanka's turret doesn't allow for any of that. Similar to how the "just don't move" during Lion's reign of terror didn't stop how effective he was at disabling defenders from being able to relocate during a rush, or how Warden is now, unable to see through smoke unless he is standing still, makes him useless during a gunfight.

you can only buy from Amazon for console. 
---
Have you tried accessing your account from another PC?  Is it a PC issue or a your account issue?
---
Good luck getting credits from someone though, I don't think there is any way to buy credits for someone else, or to transfer credits.  Since they are only available in game you don't get a code or anything to enter you just buy them through the store directly onto your account.
---
Your only real shot is to have someone log into your account from their PC and buy credits on their PC and then you log back in, but if that worked you could just find a friend or another person that would let you borrow their PC for a moment to try it.
---
I would be very, very careful letting someone just have your login information over the internet.
---
Short of that, no one can buy credits for you.
---
Spawnpeeking w/ the lord is the ultimate disrespect way to spawn peak
---
it's alright I love when people correct my grammar
---
Is it fair is players with lower ping are playing against people with higher ping who are teleporting across the map, not rendering during fights and can't intake shots because of latency issues? That doesn't sound very fair to me. Fairness is when people play on their own server/regions with people that have the same ping as them so they don't have any inconvenience. 
---
Also not salty, just want this game to be fair.
---
🔥
---
This is a great idea
---
Insurgency Sandstorm does an awesome job of having realism I think.  Shotguns in that game actually have believable range.

He is very good when used amongst a coordinated team. In solo queue when used he typically fucks over the team more often than he helps which is why people resent him

If you ADS with the pump shotguns, they have more 1 shot range than you think especially against the 1 armors

Honestly don't even know how people get into copper IV, after I finish my placement matches I'm always placed in bronze or silver, I don't think I've ever touched a copper ranked match unless it was in an early placement match.

Unlimited Powaaaaa.
---
I want this game to be fair too! Movement and shots are registered server side now, so the player with lower ping has the advantage
---
well yeah ive tried logging in on another pc of my friend which is working for him and it still didnt work i either just wait for ubi to fix it or someone could buy it for me on amazon and ill pay him with paypal ^^

You cant play them the same way (ie don't try to hold long angles).  I've had lots of fun in ranked with SG CQB and M590 on both attack and defense
---
Ela and vigil are good if you like aggressive play. Ela has good a good gadget/gun and vigil has a great gun.
---
And the next operator is gone for now :D
---
There are so many things wrong with this list I can't even count them all. I get it's your opinion, but some operators and are either objectively good or bad, opinions exempt, and should be moved 2-3 tiers.

Holy shit

Happy cakeday

BOSG is dead in a ditch

Or maybe in ranked as well
---
Pod they banned mah boi maestro
---
I don't know why they didn't just remove her barbed wire, since that's how you go about doing it iirc.
---
I'ma be honest i've just been maining shotguns lately and my favs are the GIGN and Jap shotguns (forgot the names). I feel people judge the shotguns based off of no scope shots which create a larger spread leading to more \*missed\* shots. Most of the time I can get a consistent 1-2 per round minimun just quick scoping with the shotties.
---
I was in the same boat and especially because my other main was lesion. I got Maestro as soon as I could and he is pretty fun but his gun does have a lot of recoil. I use the ACOG with the comp and I practice with Buck/Maestro in casual before I go to ranked.
---
I see what you meant. But it's all fine for tarkov because it's not a competitive game, but more survival combat sim. It would be really odd if siege did that though where it literally holds tournaments and ranked modes.
---
Thoughts and prayers friend
---
It probably is, but the ops don't need nerfing at all, they're balanced and hardly even broken
---
It's been a good month!
---
In the G2 match the other day an Echo denied Goga from planting for like the final 45 seconds of the round.
---
Great argument. I love how you went in depth as to why you deem it powerful and what you would suggest as a change.
---
He's good when he isn't banned but him and Echo seem to be the ban hammer favorites.
---
sadly yeah
---
It's a joke. Ment to imply how big of s nuisance Clash is. Yeah she's banned now but she was out for 10 months before that.
---
Lmao
---
Yeah, I believe that round cost G2 the match as well
---
Sg-cqb and supernova I believe
---
I had the sledge hammer charm on xbox. I play PC now but I miss my old skins I left behind :(

Man I haven’t got a legendary for like a year

I'd rather play house than favelas or yacht tbh

WOW, they actually changed the gloves on that uniform. The gloves used to be all black, but it was like a photoshop black filter thrown onto the fingerless gloves, so you could still see the joints and nails on his fingers. Super lazy.
---
yea i was confused at first i was shouting at my friend to hold his gun or throw the nade as it yould kill him then he just started shooting from the frag and i got real confused
---
I'd be so pissed if I was the top player on the other team lol
---
I would've been saying:
---
*"WTF!? I'M DOING WHAT I CAN, BUT WE'RE LOSING TO ONE GUY!?!? CAN ANYONE ELSE PULL THEIR WEIGHT!?"*
---
Nah
---
Its also annoying to seek more attention than everyone around you. Also calm down im just trying to explain the situation, no reason to be passive-aggressive
---
I know this has been said before, but seriously FUCK the renown.
---
Give us a another fucking pack.
---
Christ! Why is that so hard? Can we have a petition?
---
Let's say a uniform is 20000k renown. Why do you get a fraction of that?
---
If we can't have a new draw, can we have the right amount?
---
It's so very simple: don't give duplicates. It's not like they are manually printed and packaged. Amazingly, the 1's and 0's can be made to NEVER DUPLICATE.

And don't tell me it's a surprise mechanic. Fuck that condescension.

That seems logical, but this is literally the easiest way to DDoS in the game

Had the same thing happen to me with the Dusty Leather Legendary. I was fucking pissed.
---
Oh yeah once I got 0 in a row
---
Actually it’s more effective when the center mass of the player model is mostly in the reticule and you don’t go for aiming before firing. In which case it’s an effective anti push weapon when you’re an anchor
---
If only this comment had any weight to it. IQ and clash are probably my least played ops. I’m mad bc ubi doesn’t know how to properly make a game lmao. New bug after new bug every season, more bugs than any game I’ve ever played. The connection issues are far worse than any game I’ve every played. And ubi simply doesn’t care about %90 of their players. They care for pro league and that’s it. Cute emojis tho
---
insert reverse uno card
---
That waw ubisoft saying: heres a little suprise for ya!! A legendary skin and the same legendary skin just to fuck you over!!!
---
It’s great on console where recoil isn’t as bad but in pc where everyone is listening carefully so they can hear her coming and the increased recoil I’d say it’s more than balance
---
You get renown as a reward for playing, alpha packs are just an extra free reward. You may not know this but alpha packs were added in the beginning of year 2
---
You’re looking a gift horse in the mouth!
---
The seasonal skins are 100% a better option, especially since they are limited to just this season. Diamond has been in the game since Dust Line, and I don't expect it to go away anytime soon. 30K limited seasonal skin &gt; 90K permanent skin.
---
Someone’s upset
---
Yacht can go too. I’m actually a fan of Favela. I’d like to see it and Tower back in ranked.
---
That or the failed rush they tried
---
Understood. Really nice cosplay
---
r/fakehistoryporn
---
Or perhaps you guy just fail to realize the mass amounts of problems this game has and just ride the wave. With the toxicity in this game you really think I new player is going to have any fun at all? Lmaaao. Ubi has a lot of work to do

Hopefully the try to take the same angle and fucking TK each other!

Wow now, don’t forget about us Finka sausage enthusiasts.

lmaoo everyone just bans jackal, monty or blitz on attack and cav, lesion or echo on defense

If that’s an actual costume, it’s really well done because when I first saw it I started to wonder why someone would repost a Ubi image of Nøkk.
---
feelsbad, i tried tickets and ubi support on twitter. can’t think of any other reason for my toxicity ban other than player reports, but i usually play with a 5 stack and a mute in chat

Nvm you've already got the toxicity part

It's a new thing.

Its out on the Test Server

45 seconds? Great, so that way, when the team can't decide or doesn't want to work together, we can wait 3 minutes for the game to start.

There are worse legendaries out there. This is one of the better ones in my opinion

That’s a little debatable

When Ubi first promised new game modes in Siege, I was always hoping they’d bring back that mode. I do wonder what modes they were originally intending to bring (unless they actually counted the hardcore variations as new modes)

If blackbeard and a defender both aim for each other's head and shoot at the same time blackbeard will be alive but the defender won't, he can do this twice, I also used to think he was weak but now that I've learned more about the game I can see he's very strong, no he does not need a buff
---
You intentionally made the game horrible for other players. What part of you thought this was a good idea to do?
---
Hey at least you got a skin. I just got the "For scale" charm.
---
If you squint real hard you can barely make out something happening!
---
Found the guy who just got smacked by a Vigil main lmao.
---
&gt;Because a full body mobilized shield means the only way to kill him is to get a headshot.
---
He would be a sitting target in that mode. I don't know if you didn't understand this, when the shield is deployed he won't be able to move, he will only be able to shoot. 
---
Also I don't understand how this could be OP, he isn't moving in this mode so it will be easy to get a head shot.
---
Literally everyone wants this.
---
Is that why I’m here? Oh well

Pretty sure that you can get a special router that can protect against ddos unless im mistaken. Some of those im also pretty sure log the ips of incoming traffic. I could be completely mistaken as I dont have much experience being ddosed myself.

People can’t be expected to go buy new routers to protect themselves from a security threat that Ubi is responsible for.
---
And if I’m not mistaken, you can’t track their IPs unless they’re in your party chat, because it’s the server that they DDOS, not you specifically....
---
Jackel just isn't fun to play against. It turns into you and him running around the map and wasting the entire round. When you get scanned two or three times in a row its stupid. They need to nerf his ability. They should reduce how many pings he gets or how long your footprints remain visible. Because if you walk outside of objective once in prep you can be scanned almost till halfway through the match for it. A dumb mechanic. I prefer him banned.
---
Bandit
---
You can still headshot him, He is the opposite to Blackbeard
---
1. Drone. Call it out and don't push alone. follow your teammates and bait them if you have to.
---
2. If your lineup is all five of those operators, you have bigger problems than an enemy cav.
---
IQ is a good counter, but Lion Dokkaibe (spell check) and Jackal are very efficient and strong Cav counters, as well as drones. Which everyone has.
---
Yeah right? when I first got siege I was let down by how there’s basically only three pvp game modes. I get it now though they could easily make these three the E Sports game modes and give us fun stuff like Dr Phill to play casual or something
---
I got a worse one. Ash isn't toxic, you just can't play against her. (I don't actually think this don't worry.)

I love how that one guy without reverse fire can theoretically bully Ur team and u can't do anything about it

Yeah you shouldnt have to specifically buy a piece of equipment to do stuff. But in general a ddos protection device is good. Since you can play without worrying
---
Rainbow six reddit everyone. Tell someone you dont want to sweat in ranked and get told to get off my high horse. Amazing. 10/10 community.
---
Depends on a lot of factors. The wall breach capabilities and massive close range damage is much more effective a lot of the time than guns like the fmg-9 even at 4K+
---
I love constantly ping people on well hidden valk cams. The panic of trying to find the camera is hilarious.
---
Any operator could have done what they did in this clip though, with or without an lmg...
---
Ubisoft: we have removed ACOG due to exploits involving lean spamming which turns operators invisible, increases their speed and removes recoil for the game
---
Glad they spent the time on these new pro league skins instead of fixing their game!
---
I don't understand why people think this will be Blackbeard 2.
---
You can still headshot him and he can't move, this is the opposite of Blackbeard
---
That's the point
---
Hardbass version needed
---
They said it's an engine limitation.
---
Wait do hackers ddos the server or do they ddos you internet because I’m pretty sure the only way someone can ddos you is if they get you’re ip.

BTW, you forgot the text chat spam on PC lagging the game for all players depsite Ubisoft and this very subreddit not even acknowledging the issue.
---
At first I didn’t even realize this was a cosplay. This is really good
---
Eh, I think that the seasional skins for the last few seasons have been garbage compared to some of the stuff around 3-4 seasons back. But yeah, you're prabably right. Diamond does show some kind of status (sometimes) tho, which is the second aspect avout skins (one being looks and the other status).
---
Oh look it's Siege o'clock! 
---
*Boots up*
---
&gt; And obviously the artists that makes skins don't code, they are artists for a reason xD.

Ubi allocates more resources to this division that could be used to help improve the game. Even with such a division, they could add more devs or pressure the existing ones to fix the code faster. If it were a bigger issue, they'd deal with it- at the end of the day people like you don't understand that they just see these games as a cash cow, and they milk children/whales for all they're worth.
---
*I gently open the door...*
---
Cant because there are Official 3rd party controllers, Accessibility controllers, other device external usb devices, native K&amp;M compatible games and elite controllers etc... 
---
Only thing the devs of a game can do is disable native K&amp;M support which r6s had disabled since forever.
---
Its annoying as fuck but its not a easy thing to fix. All competitive shooting games has this issue on console. Epic tried to fix the problem and they banned a bunch of normal players with elite controllers and the adapter companies had a workaround fix within 24hs.
---
They hit the server.  They’re not hitting the players.
---
Honestly though, Lesion is who I always ban. I know he's relatively easy to play against but I'd much rather play against Echo who IS easy to play against, with or without IQ.
---
Monty mains where you at?
---
YeH I’m on Xbox and solo q to plat 2 every season. I used to be able to get diamond and plat 1 consistently; but now I’d say 9/10 players plat2 and higher are using it because they love showing off they’re perfect recoil control and isnta 180 headshots. Not to mention the same losers who copper 4 boost. I don’t think I’ve played more than a half dozen legitimate no bs ranked games in the last 2 years. I get my plat 2 every season and then stop giving a fuck
---
Why does Recruit have massive hands
---
Every player on the other team are in silver though?
---
Who gets dibs on posting this tomorrow?
---
They didnt take a weak position on it, its really hard to prove that the user is a k&amp;m user. 
---
Yes sometimes its really visible but other times there are really good elite controller users that has high sens that can aim good.
---
Ok that makes sense
---
Unfortunately doesnt work. 
---
They arnt attacking you as an individual, but rather everyone in the server simultaneously. 
---
Theres nothing you can do to prevent it, and it affects everyone. 
---
Theres currently 3 types
---
Server stressing - what the OP has experienced
---
Server crashes - kicks everyone back to main menu, potentially with an abandon sanction and loss for the non exploiting team
---
Personal DDoS - rare, and done through PMs etc
---
Does it even matter if a male or female cosplay as dokkaebi? As long as the cosplay looks good that's all that matters lmao
---
I'd trust her
---
Good replacement for the soup can
---
If it was just a single game it happens on could blame the game, but if it's happening on different games as well, it has to be the console that's causing it
---
Good luck guys! And I’m sorry that people suck. I love this game and want to see it thrive.
---
Truly one of the best AA weapons the north has along with the RPG and Dishka. Dishka is kinda awkward to aim, but it hits like a truck when you land the shots.
---
IMO I can see it from the angle of "you're playing professional soldiers who dont allow such conduct and behavior on the field"
---
Seems accurate hehe
---
It’s Kevin
---
Rank? 
---
Last season it prevented me getting Diamond as it happened near 20 times. 
---
Already had it happen 5 times this season, but luckily got my Diamond
---
I think its just the &lt; part because i think u saw somewhere that if spammed enough it would crash everyones game
---
they aren't hitting people offline but attacking the server.
---
that's like saying that food critics can't say anything negative about someone's cooking because they can't cook themselves.
---
NOW THIS, IS EPIC!
---
Oh yes it's very technical, in fact that's the term Six used when he told me about this bug
---
A proper facelift for Ranked.
---
I understand that this is a serious topic but I believe they can very easily fix the cheating. Games such as Fortnite have keyboard and mouse support (on xbox) so that you don’t need an adapter, but if it detects a keyboard it will put you on pc servers so everyone has a fair playing ground. If siege could do this it would be the end of people playing with adapters.
---
Friend of mine brought it in the morning and got the skins in the night. 
---
Give it some time, its probably take some time to process the payment or some shit.
---
You were probably being very toxic very consistently with a response like that.
---
Calculated
---
Yeh when the servers die on match point with 1 person left alive repeatedly - its more than suspect. 
---
Especially server stressers who will stress the server the exact moment their plant goes down
---
Thanks for the PSA
---
Wait I think I played this game if it was consulate
---
Damn those shaders lookin nice
---
yang gang 2020
---
Yeah that would nice to have, at this point I straight up only play casual because of all the M&amp;K players
---
Just tryna look out for my fellow PlayStation mates
---
Could be, but form my experience it doesn't change during a round, it's just between rounds that it changes. It doesn't change as often as it would have to if it was based on what's in front of you
---
Cav got taken in a match this past week though, don't remember who it was though
---
I was plat at the time idk their ranks
---
Tritium is like that sometimes
---
It may be annoying but it's very predictable and still fairly easy to shoot while concussed. I do think its duration should be slightly reduced though. The thing with Echo is his ability takes away a gun from the team and he has to hide in a corner that isn't easy to get to making it harder for him to clutch. Once he's dead, his main use is gone. Lesion's ability, however, still keeps a defender gun in play and doesn't require him hiding while also slowing down pushes (and stopping last minute pushes). He also has some of the same intel gathering potential if played correctly.
---
If his shield is capable of stopping even one bullet; which it is; the he’s blatantly overpowered and doesn’t belong in this game. Ubisoft I think learned they’re lesson and won’t be giving him any more significant buffs. He’s a crutch operator for people who can’t aim and don’t want to put any effort into the game.
---
Why would a player currently using a adapter to get a advantage over controller users so they can get higher ranks, purposefully put themself at a equal game and play with other K&amp;M players?
---
Epic still has a issue with K&amp;M players on the controller only gamemode.
---
The thing about video games is that the distances are all compressed. Real life combat takes place over hundreds of meters. The effective range of even relatively short ranged assault rifles is in the 400-500m area. But with some exceptions (arma, pubg, etc) you're almost never having combat outside of 75 or so meters in video games. It's just a practical thing - video game style tends to be more run and gun rather than trying to spot subtle movement at 400m, and TVs and monitors have limitations compared to real life in terms of seeing that distance.
---
So then, if a long range fight in a video game is like 75m, then proportionately it makes sense that if a rifle is effective at that long 75m range, then a shotgun is effective in more like a 10m range, to preserve their relative range and differentiate them as long range and short range weapons.
---
I can barely get to plat 3. They really should ban it, I’m sure the stats will show they have an absolute advantage against controllers.
---
Fortnite banned it
---
Why did this remind me of Christmas lights. Like how it moves.
---
Theres currently 3 types of attack
---
1 and 2 do not require IPs, plus theres plenty of videos on this issue i can happily show you when on my laptop later
---
That's strange. Bug, perhaps?
---
Once had a 19 kill game we lost
---
op
---
This just looks like Blackbeard with extra steps
---
This is definitely not the best we have on console lol
---
Need I remind everyone about Frosts shotgun with the introduction of Black Ice?
---
I’m perfectly fine avoiding that.
---
Windows 8 deserves that fate
---
If you want to take that stand that racism/sexism/homophobia is ok then you feel free but there is nothing wrong with a company deciding they are not ok with that stuff.
---
wut
---
I don't know if his mouth is open or if he's sticking his tongue out....
---
Can't wait to see what exploit they unintentionally roll with this.
---
The DSHK is great so long as you aren’t getting teamkilled for its use lol
---
Yea there hasn’t been a game that both nails the realism and balance. Tarkov is an example of a game getting realism but not balance, call of duty is an example of balance but no realism. It’s a two part thing. Tarkov gets ONE part of that right.
---
Different types of roaming, Cav is a ambush try roaming op that feeds on teams with bad coms and bad droning. 
---
Vigil is a jager like operator where you roam and hold down a room with their really good guns as much as they can then rotate around using the impacts.
---
Why are you in public
---
the whole word filter thing has been crap from the start.
---
if people are so concerned about racial slurs then let them just disable chat on their end.
---
prior to the word filter update i think i saw 2 or 3 people at max that actually said a no-no word. It's a problem that never needed fixing.
